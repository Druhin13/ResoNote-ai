  "lyrics": "I learned this trick at a young age\r\nNever live in the spotlight\r\nI took all the goodness that I could find, held it up to the night\r\nIf I could give it all away, let the wind sweep it out of my hands\r\nI could be free from the burden of lonesome pride\n\nI'd be clean\n\nThe mind trails off until I snap back\n\nThe weight was simply replaced with shame\n\nFacing the sun in hopes to stay warm, even without you\n\nHow did I find the time to be gone so much?\n\nAnd see there it is, whispering to me like always\n\nYou're familiar\n\nYou've become my lullaby for quite some time now\n\nThe mind trails off until I snap\n\nCan I correct all of layers of lies?\n\nRisk taking, letting myself be known to you\n\nOffering all the pain and my goodness in hopes of what it could do\n\nMaybe I'll find that true freedom\n\nAnd maybe I'll hold it for a night\n\nCourage calls me out from my shell\n\nLiberation waits until I bloom, bloom, bloom\n\nShame, haven't you had enough of me yet?\n\nYou're beginning to take all that I am\n\nHaven't you had, all that you want?\n\nYou’re beginning to take away\n\nHaven't you had, all that you want?\n\nI know you’ve had all of me\n\nHaven't you had, all that you want?\n\nAll of me\n\nSo instead of pushing you away by needing you to stay, I refrain from casually allowing this shame to stay\n\nAnd allow you to leave, allow you to go, allow you to be whatever it is that you get to be",
