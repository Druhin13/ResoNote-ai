  "lyrics": "You were the shadow to my light\r\nDid you feel us?\r\nAnother star, you fade away\r\nAfraid our aim is out of sight\r\nWanna see us, alive\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWas it all in my fantasy?\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWere you only imaginary?\n\n\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nAtlantis, under the sea, under the sea\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nAnother dream\n\nThe monster's running wild inside of me\n\nI'm faded, I'm faded\n\nSo lost, I'm faded, I'm faded\n\nSo lost, I'm faded\n\n\n\nThese shallow waters never met what I needed\n\nI'm letting go, a deeper dive\n\nEternal silence of the sea\n\nI'm breathing, alive\n\n\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nUnder the bright but faded lights\n\nYou set my heart on fire\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nWhere are you now?\n\n\n\nWhere are you now? \n\nAtlantis under the sea, under the sea\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nAnother dream\n\nThe monster's running wild inside of me\n\nI'm faded, I'm faded\n\nSo lost, I'm faded, I'm faded\n\nSo lost, I'm faded",
