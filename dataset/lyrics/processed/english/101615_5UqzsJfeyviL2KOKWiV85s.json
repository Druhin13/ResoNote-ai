  "lyrics": "Well I know I got him\r\nBut I think that's something else just might begin\r\nThere's a pull on my heart\r\nThat tells me some things bound to start\r\nAnd you got me all figured out\n\nNow everything's new\n\nAnd I don't know what to do\n\nI gotta figure it out\n\nBefore it's too late\n\nCause somebody's heart can break, break\n\n\n\nIf I told him the truth\n\nIt would break apart the world that we both knew\n\nWish that I could just lie\n\nAnd tell him everything is fine\n\n\n\nBut you got me all figured out\n\nNow everything's new\n\nAnd I don't know what to do\n\nI gotta figure it out\n\nBefore it's too late\n\nCause somebody's heart can break, break\n\nBreak, break\n\n\n\nBreak away and start something new\n\nBut breakdown come back to you\n\nI don't know what I should do\n\nAnd I'm so afraid that somebody's heart can break\n\nCause somebody's heart can break\n\nCause somebody's heart can break\n\nBefore it's too late\n\nCause somebody's heart can break\n\n\n\nWell I know I got him\n\nBut I think that something else just might begin",
