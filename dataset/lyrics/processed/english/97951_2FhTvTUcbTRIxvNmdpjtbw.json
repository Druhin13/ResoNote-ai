  "lyrics": "He was certain, so was I\r\nThere was comfort in her sighs\r\nDreams and ideas should not be the same thing\r\nYou waited, smiling for this?\r\nOh, she’d want it\n\nIf she knew\n\nShe could take it\n\nI thought too\n\nBe careful, be cautious but you just wished harder\n\nYou waited, smiling for this?\n\n\n\n“But they love you!” over and over “they love you!”\n\nThousands and thousands of eyes just like mine\n\nAching to find who they are\n\n\"Oh, they love you! Oh, you can feel how they love you!\"\n\nCoated and warm but that’s all they can do\n\nWords only get through if they’re sharp\n\n\n\nOh how fitting\n\nFor one so fake\n\nMake me a fairy\n\nWhatever it takes\n\nAnd just like her tale my dream was a scam\n\nYou waited, smiling for this?\n\n\n\nI am burned out\n\nI smell of smoke\n\nIt seeps through her cracks and so I start to choke\n\nSentences sit in her mouth that are templated\n\nYou waited, smiling for this?\n\n\n\n“But they love you!” over and over “they love you!”\n\nThousands and thousands of eyes just like mine\n\nAching to find who they are\n\n\"Oh, they love you! Oh you can feel how they love you!\"\n\nCoated and warm but that’s all they can do\n\nWords only get through if they’re sharp\n\n\n\nOh, I can just talk about it (I can just talk about it)\n\nMaybe I'll talk about it (Maybe I'll talk about it)\n\nI'll never talk about it (I'll never talk about it)\n\nNo, I cannot talk about it\n\n\n\nDon't build hope on something broken\n\nI am not cartoon\n\nCry for help, I am not joking\n\nI might just leave soon\n\nDon't build hope on something broken\n\nI am not cartoon\n\nCry for help, I am not joking\n\nI might just leave soon",
