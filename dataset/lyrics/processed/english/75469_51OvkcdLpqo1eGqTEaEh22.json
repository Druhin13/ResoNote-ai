  "lyrics": "No words explain what I want to say and no city could take your place\r\nNo, time’s not a reason to give it up and no distance will be too much\r\nSo darling how could I forget\r\nStood on your left until the end\n\nI wrote a song so you could know I don’t believe in letting go\n\nI wrote a song so you could hold on, hold on\n\n\n\nTwo halves with an ocean apart until june\n\nTraded hearts so I’ll beat for you, and you’ll beat for me\n\nBut I broke on the side of the road in michigan\n\nThinking back to the days we tempted fate because we were seventeen\n\nSo sing with me\n\n\n\nI wrote a song so you could know I don’t believe in letting go\n\nI wrote a song so you could hold on, hold on\n\nYou are the reason I’m getting through\n\nI’ll sing a song they’ll sing for you\n\nYou are the reason I’m learning to hold on, hold on\n\n\n\nSo close your eyes and listen to what I say\n\nIt will hurt but it’s worth the pain\n\nBecause time has a reason for every scar\n\nAnd the reason lives in your heart everyday\n\n\n\nSo darling how could I forget\n\nStood on your left until the end\n\n\n\nI wrote a song so you could know I don’t believe in letting go\n\nI wrote a song so you could hold on, hold on\n\nYou are the reason I’m getting through\n\nI’ll sing a song they’ll sing for you\n\nYou are the reason I’m learning to hold on, hold on\n\n\n\nHold on\n\nHold on",
