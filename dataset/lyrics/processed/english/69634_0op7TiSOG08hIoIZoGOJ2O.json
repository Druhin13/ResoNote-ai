  "lyrics": "I'll be the one to show you the way\r\nYou'll be the one to always complain\r\n3 in the morning come a bang bang bang\r\nAll out of fags and I just can't wait\r\nCancel the thing that I said I'd do \nI don't feel comfortable talking to you \n\nUnless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe,\n\nThen I'll be in the lobby drinking for two\n\n\n\n18, balding, star, Golden, fallen, heart\n\n\n\nLook at the shaky's whats with the blush\n\nFresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush\n\nEveryones gathered to idolize me,\n\nI hate the way you talk your Japanese scream\n\nIt's been so long since I left the shed,\n\nYou kick the bucket and I'll swing my legs\n\nAlways remember the pact that we made,\n\nToo young to die but old is the grave\n\n\n\nIm a gonna show the way",
