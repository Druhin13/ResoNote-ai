  "lyrics": "A plant where I had grown my fruit\r\nIt's dried and hangs down like a noose\r\nMy shell has become a haunted place\r\nThe ghost inside makes me the same\r\nI just want release\n\nI just want release\n\n\n\nI keep on searching, just to find\n\nI'm absent inside this skin disguise\n\nMy shell has become a haunted place\n\nThe ghost inside makes me the same\n\n\n\nI just want release\n\nI just want release",
