  "lyrics": "Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me \nAnd make me burn the candle right down, \nBut baby, baby, I don't need no jewels in my crown. \n\n'Cause all you women is low down gamblers, \nCheatin' like I don't know how, \n\nBut baby, baby, there's fever in the funk house now. \n\nThis low down bitchin' got my poor feet a itchin', \n\nYou know you know the duece is still wild. \n\n\n\nBaby, I can't stay, you got to roll me \n\nAnd call me the tumblin' dice. \n\n\n\nAlways in a hurry, I never stop to worry, \n\nDon't you see the time flashin' by. \n\nHoney, got no money, \n\nI'm all sixes and sevens and nines. \n\nSay now, baby, I'm the rank outsider, \n\nYou can be my partner in crime. \n\n\n\nBut baby, I can't stay, \n\nYou got to roll me and call me the tumblin', \n\nRoll me and call me the tumblin' dice. \n\n\n\nOh, my, my, my, I'm the lone crap shooter, \n\nPlayin' the field ev'ry night. \n\n\n\nBaby, can't stay, \n\nYou got to roll me and call me the tumblin' (dice), \n\nRoll me and call me the tumblin' (Got to roll me.) dice. \n\nGot to roll me. Got to roll me...........",
