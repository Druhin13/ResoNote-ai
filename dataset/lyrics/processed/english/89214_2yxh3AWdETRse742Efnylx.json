  "lyrics": "Somebody fill my cup while I keep this reefer burnin'\r\nCome fuck my mood up, I hope you do need to speak on somethin'\r\nYou can sleep on me but your deathbed is the sheets and covers\r\nI mean if you beef then the repercussion's the reaper's caution\r\nFuck 'em, tell your favorites I'm a league above 'em\r\nI put that on every piece of pussy that my penis bust in\n\nLord, I think I can hear them demons call me\n\nChrist, they're trynaa cross me like the Jesus somethin'\n\nThat's a super bad look, rappers seem to be McLovin\n\nSayin' Horroh's weak and then ask for a fucking feature from him\n\nI fuck your bitch when I see your woman\n\nIf she doesn't know me, I'll tell her I'm Justin Bieber's cousin\n\n\n\nAre you not perhaps afraid of what might happen?\n\n\n\nThey could never call me ordinary\n\nWhat? Fuck 'em, with one foot in the mortuary\n\nThey said that hip-hop's dead, I hit them all to get it\n\nPut it on my back and I don't even think the corpse is heavy\n\nTell them stupid cartoon rappers Tutankhamun's back\n\nI'm 2Pac with his juice back\n\nA zoot wrap, two straps, a Hail Mary two track\n\nBitch, I'll kill us all if you don't move back\n\nKamikaze, I find it hard giving half a shit\n\nNarcissist, I guarantee I've got a larger dick\n\nThis fucking groupie tried to send me to the bar for drinks\n\nI told that thirsty bitch, \"Here's a yard of piss you could hardly lift\"\n\nBob Marley spliff will put me where the martians live\n\nI use a couple bloodclaat yaadis as my pharmacist\n\n\n\nWhat might happen?\n\n\n\nBitches like kick flips (Yay), all up on my gnarly tricks\n\nAnd they just wanna blow me like some broken Sega cartridges\n\nI led my hyenas to the deerâ€™s blood\n\nNot a strong enough for bringing me a werewolf\n\nI've got a big old gang to get it cleared up\n\nTrip and lead your sisters to leaking liquid from tear ducts\n\nKeep on giving that weird look, you'll get hit with this beer cup\n\nBully bitch stomp her head, if you're full of shit, you appear tough\n\nYou're nothing here to our motherfuckers in here\n\nDon't suck a dick, you come near, you'll get fuckin' kicked in your beer gut\n\nVictims in fear when I put a couple whispers in ears\n\nMan, enough fuckin' kittens in here, tell them pussy whiskers get sheared up\n\nMother, cousins, and peers but they not heard from you for years\n\n'Cause we get cut and chopped, then we clear up\n\nBloods, innards, and smeared guts\n\nSufferin' succotash\n\nTook an upper-class slut mother back to fuck her while her son was in a rugby match\n\nYou in the club, turnin' up, doing the dougie dance\n\nI'm at your crib, choking a bitch with her underpants\n\n\n\nAre you not perhaps afraid of what might happen?\n\nAre you not perhaps afraid of what might happen?",
