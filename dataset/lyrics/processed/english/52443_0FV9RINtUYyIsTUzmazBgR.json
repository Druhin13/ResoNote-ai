  "lyrics": "Well it's not that easy babe, just to walk into my mind.\r\nBecause the door, it stays locked, it stays locked, most of the time.\r\nWell it's not an easy thing, trying to keep myself in line.\r\nCause temptations always knocking, always knocking, down the stop sign.\r\nIs it safe to assume, it's my fault, what a joke\n\nSo please let me be, on my own, Overgrown.\n\n\n\nYeah they're too old to feel, things for the first time.\n\nBut the clock keeps spinning, keeps spinning, while I die.\n\nI can't control the beast! Never was a... NOT SURE\n\nBecause it knows that you're turning, that you're turning, a blind eye.\n\n\n\nIs it safe to assume, it's my fault, what a joke\n\nSo please let me be, on my own, Overgrown.\n\nIs it safe to assume, it's my fault, what a joke\n\nSo please let me be, on my own, Overgrown.\n\n\n\nJAM \n\n\n\nWell I could've been anything, anything, anything\n\nBut I instead I was nothing at all!!\n\nWell I could've been anything, anything, anything\n\nBut I instead I was nothing at all!",
