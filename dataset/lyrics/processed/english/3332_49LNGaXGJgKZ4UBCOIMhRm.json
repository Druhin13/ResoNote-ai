let them niggas show off\r\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\n\n\nTop down in the summer, top down in the summer\n\nI came back like LeBron down 3 to 1\n\nI don't understand man, it make me wonder\n\nWhy the homie tried to rob him if he had a gun\n\nHide behind shades watching life fade\n\nGirls shaking ass, it must be a parade\n\nIf all these niggas on I must be the one\n\nIf all these niggas shooters I must be the gun\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm bout to fuck it up\n\nShe shaking that ass so fast, the cash she bout to run it up\n\nLike what is your motif\n\nThey want the fame, I want cash and promotion\n\nI'm making it splash on that ass like the ocean\n\nI ride my own wave cause my buzz'll be rolling\n\nI'm grinding double the time for mine, I'm keeping it coming in\n\nHad the Audi at 18, the Bimmer at 20\n\nNow I'm bout to cop the Benz\n\nMy circle so small that everyone else on the outside looking in\n\nI don't trust nobody, I don't see nobody\n\nVersace shades on my lens\n\n\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\n\n\nReally got money, I rap\n\nWhen I fall through the trap I'ma show off\n\nSmoking that KK, you hit this shit once I promise that you gon' cough\n\nRiding around in my '62 [?] once when I skrrt off\n\nPassenger seat got your bitch\n\nIf she say she don't smoke that's a turn off\n\nTatted up, I got my shirt off\n\nHating you can't get a word off\n\nYou the kind I never heard of\n\nTaylor Gang or seeing murder\n\nShe want some dick, guarantee I'ma serve her\n\nPractice what I preach\n\n[?] me, I just teach what I learned\n\nGot weed and I burn it\n\nShe giving me brains, that secret service\n\nDon't speak what you [?]\n\nWe park the low rider so deep on the curb\n\nStay holding it down for my team on you geeks and you nerds\n\nYou ain't bout your paper my nigga and I think it's absurd\n\nShe say she love you but really that shit's a diversion\n\nSay that you stacking but really be splurging\n\nI get a old school Impala and cut that shit up like a surgeon\n\n\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\n(Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\n(We smoking good over here)\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\n(My nigga Casey what's good\n\nGang Gang, Jet Life, you heard?)\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\n(Double that shit up, roll another joint\n\nPut another bitch on top of that bitch\n\nBuy another car [?]\n\nGet another watch, get another chain\n\nDo your own thing nigga, Taylor Gang)\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\n\n\nShe ain't with the questions\n\nI told her I ain't with the extras\n\nI'm glad we made a connection\n\nChecking them hoes off my check list\n\nAll in the club and we flexing\n\nShe fucking it up in the section\n\nIt made her think all we do is sin\n\nAnd then she realized I'm a blessing\n\nReally do it, they gotta show off\n\nThis real life, I can't take a day off\n\nGo hard or go home like the playoffs\n\nIf you stay there, you might just get paid off\n\nYou ain't never whipped these cars nigga\n\nYou ain't never seen a hundred large nigga\n\nYou ain't minaj'd these broads nigga\n\nOne thing bout my gang, we all get it\n\nGirl I pull up in the hood for ya\n\nEverything that look good, it ain't good for ya\n\nThe haters is watching, I can't trust 'em\n\nIf the bullets start flying it's no discussion\n\nHe did too much talking, I had to rush 'em\n\nGot your bitch in the back and I ain't bluffing\n\nThe streets is so crazy but it's what made me\n\nFifty mil couldn't change me, I'm still Casey\n\nWe run up the bands and we going crazy\n\nYeah we run up the bands and we going crazy\n\nBook up the flights and we on vacation\n\nGave her a shot but I never chase it\n\nThe money I'm married, I can't replace her\n\nDo me a favor, do me no favors\n\nNothing was handed, I had to take it\n\nThey don't wanna see me make it, yeah\n\n\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off\n\nThat money is coming, that money is coming\n\nAnd I'm 'bout fuck it up\n\nDouble up, double up, double up, double up\n\nNo, I can't get enough\n\nI'm really the boy I ain't gotta say it, let them niggas show off\n\nI step in the party like \"Let's get it started\"\n\nYeah I'm 'bout to go off",
