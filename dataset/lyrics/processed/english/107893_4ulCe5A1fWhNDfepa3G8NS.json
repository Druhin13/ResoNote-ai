  "lyrics": "And they say\r\nOpium to the ceiling\r\nAll for the love of plugs, squealing \"ugh\", healing\r\nNo more Timberland turf, you're too soft for this\r\nAward-winning awkwardness you walking off into the office with\n\nIn the rims with friends and like state trials and Paypals\n\nIn nondescript homes in Arizona\n\nIn sub-divided neighborhoods, with floors made of solid wood\n\nIn roofs of clay tiles sits a couple million dollars\n\nSaid I tried but the old me blew it\n\nExactly how you knew I'd do it\n\nAll my brothers, I would love to paint 'em Jewish\n\nReinfiltrate the movement and assassinate the music\n\nExaggerate the ass and face then masturbate to it\n\nThe constituency brilliant but the candidates are stupid\n\nI'm too rude to ask for nudes\n\nBut way too ruthless not to pursue it\n\n\n\nMaybe, maybe you'll feel me when I (maybe you can feel me when I)\n\nFeel me when I say (feel me when I say)\n\nWhatever don't kill me (don't kill me, don't kill me)\n\nGets me through the day\n\n\n\nChorus to the horses made her body porous\n\nAbsorbing up the pork made 'em enormous\n\nFear of rape made 'em informant\n\nFully 'shroomed in the motel room waging the torment\n\nNever trust a dope fiend with your hopes and dreams\n\nLet 'em play in museums with the dead bodies and broken things\n\nWhat happens when the sugar barons meet the coca kings\n\nAnd they beam it into space\n\nSeem to be in place at the parent teacher conference\n\nWith hallucinations screaming in her face\n\nThe cleaning lady crazy, she say she got a demon in the safe\n\nBut it's eating through the back and soon be leaving through the gates\n\nThe hollerer shouts, \"Who's bright enough to pay a toddler\n\nTo watch a ghoulish Oxycontin gobbler on Hanukkah?\"\n\nMaybe a Phoenix-based multi-million dollar launderer\n\nWho fucked the cartels so bad, she attends court on the monitor\n\n\n\nMaybe, maybe you'll feel me when I (maybe you can feel me when I)\n\nFeel me when I say (feel me when I say)\n\nWhatever don't kill me (don't kill me, don't kill me)\n\nGets me through the day (gets me through the day)\n\n\n\nBad trippin' through the tenderloin\n\nSlimmer than a slot to enter coins to let a nigga join\n\nA figure skater like Michelle Kwan\n\nAluminum illuminated to a hail bomb, ice\n\nThen hold onto it like the L. Ron device\n\nThen pass the audition to the poor hands sided in Maelstrom's position\n\nStreet sales in comparison pale to the Scottsdale bail bonds commission\n\nIt's like trappin' out the pawn shop\n\nGettin' close to the magic like the wrappin' on the wand box\n\nThird layer from the wave\n\nAnd grant absurd last prayers and first favors from the grave\n\nTo crack the pipes like icy nights and turn mayors into slaves\n\nPolitics bring fevers to punish dealers\n\nAdjudicate the Johnsons and stop the ring leaders\n\nThe Geese Howards and King Ghidorahs\n\nCook E in the family tree for steam fevers\n\n\n\nMaybe, maybe you'll feel me when I (maybe you can feel me when I)\n\nFeel me when I say (feel me when I say)\n\nWhatever don't kill me (don't kill me, don't kill me)\n\nGets me through the day (gets me through the day)",
