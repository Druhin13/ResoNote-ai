  "lyrics": "Once upon a time in South Africa\r\nI turned to you under the bleeding moon\r\nThe ships were sailing in beneath the table top\r\nIt was three o'clock, the night was still\r\nYeah, we stayed at Joanna's for a night or two\n\nThough she never really saw us\n\nWe were too consumed\n\nWe never really even got to see the place\n\nWe were way too busy chasing on the place\n\n\n\nI don't even wanna go out tonight\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even need to sugarcoat it, girl\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nBy my side\n\n\n\nI got to know you better on the trampoline\n\nAlthough I am aware I won't know everything\n\nAnd it's a big jump, big jump\n\nPull yourself together, boy, you haven't got forever, boy\n\nAnd if it feels like heaven, well\n\n\n\nI don't even wanna go out tonight\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even need to sugarcoat it, girl\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even wanna go out tonight\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even need to sugarcoat it, girl\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\n\n\nAnd it's a big jump, big jump\n\nPull yourself together, boy\n\nBig jump, big jump\n\nYou haven't got forever, boy\n\nBig jump, big jump\n\nAnd if it feels like heaven, well\n\nNow it feels like heaven and\n\nWhen it feels like heaven, I\n\n\n\nI don't even wanna go out tonight\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even need to sugarcoat it, girl\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even wanna go out tonight\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nI don't even need to sugarcoat it, girl\n\nNo, I've got you by my side\n\nBy my side",
