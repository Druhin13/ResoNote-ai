  "lyrics": "One night is all it takes to fall for you\r\nA single touch of your taste\r\nTo make me fall for you\r\nOne look from your eyes\r\nIs what I'm dreaming of\n\nWaking up by your smile\n\nIs what I'm dreaming of\n\n\n\nWhen the stars collide\n\nWe connect the dots in each others eyes\n\nShining so bright till we find the light\n\nShine so bright till we grow\n\n\n\nAfterglow\n\nAfterglow\n\nAfterglow\n\n\n\nBreathing without your breath\n\nWill make me lose my mind\n\nYour light is all I see in my dark times\n\n\n\n'Cause when the stars collide\n\nWe connect the dots in each others eyes\n\nShining so bright till we find the light\n\nShine so bright till we glow\n\n\n\nAfterglow\n\nAfterglow\n\nAfterglow\n\n\n\nIf you love somebody\n\nIf you love someone\n\nWait around for the perfect moment to come\n\nYou helped me fly\n\nWhen I was heavy I was down and now I\n\nWill lift you up and pull you closer to mine\n\nWhen I was heavy I was down and now I\n\nWill lift you up and pull you closer to mine\n\n\n\nWe connect the dots till we find the light\n\nShining so bright till the stars collide\n\nWe connect the dots till we find the light\n\nShine so bright till we glow",
