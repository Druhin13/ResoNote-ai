  "lyrics": "Small Town Kid\r\nEveryday someone asks me what's my story and what do I like to do\r\nAnd everyday, for the most part, I only go so far; I almost never tell the truth\r\n'Cause the truth is behind me there's not much, to give up, I like simple, not complicated\n\nChorus:\n\n('Cause) I'm a small town kid, driven by rock music\n\nAnd some honky-tonk, in the mix\n\nI like whiskey in coke, a double to the top\n\nA shot of cuervo now and then\n\nI never ask for a lot, I'll never need much\n\nJust a good-looking lady who can drive my truck\n\nI'm not afraid to admit, I'm that small town kid\n\n\n\nCity lights, yellow cabs, Yankee hats, Suits and ties everywhere\n\nThese City folks, they look at me in my shirt and jeans, they make me think I don't fit in here\n\nWell the things they say might be right, they might be so but one thing I know: I can't change who I am\n\n\n\n('Cause) I'm a small town kid, driven by rock music\n\nAnd some honky-tonk, in the mix\n\nI like whiskey in coke, a double to the top\n\nA shot of cuervo now and then\n\nI never ask for a lot, I'll never need much\n\nJust a good-looking lady who can drive my truck\n\nI'm not afraid to admit, I'm that small town kid\n\n\n\nMama don't you worry, they won't change me\n\nA hundred thousand miles mean nothing to me\n\n\n\n('Cause) I'm a small town kid, driven by rock music\n\nAnd some honky-tonk, in the mix\n\nI like whiskey in coke, a double to the top\n\nA shot of cuervo now and then\n\nI never ask for a lot, I'll never need much\n\nJust a good-looking lady who can drive my truck\n\nI'm not afraid to admit, I'm that small town kid",
