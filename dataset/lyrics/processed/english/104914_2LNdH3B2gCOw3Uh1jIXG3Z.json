  "lyrics": "While the city sleeps, I'm awake\r\nCaught up in the dreams, I can't create\r\nWhile the city sleeps, I'm awake\r\nLocked up in my mind, I can't escape\r\nThere's nothing I can do but wait\r\nI call you crying 'cause it's too much pain\n\nI can tell you don't get it\n\n'Cause you tell me that everything will be okay\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do is cry\n\nThat's all I wanna do\n\nAll I wanna do is cry\n\nBand my head, until I start to fly\n\nBang, bang, I start to fly\n\nBang, bang, I start to fly\n\n\n\nBaby, I just dyed my hair\n\nTo make me feel like I don't care\n\nIt'll be my war paint\n\n'Cause Lord knows I need strength, I need strength\n\nMondays might be alright\n\nAnd Sundays will probably hurt\n\n'Cause when your mouth starts moving with the noise\n\nI don't hear a single word\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do is cry\n\nThat's all I wanna do\n\nAll I wanna do is cry\n\nBand my head, until I start to fly\n\nBang, bang, I start to fly\n\nBang, bang, I start to fly\n\nI watch the sky get brighter\n\nThe lights get higher now\n\n\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nHurting, hurting\n\n\n\n\n\nStuck in the traffic that's racing in my mind\n\nBlankets of woe just to cover up my eyes\n\n'Cause what I need, what I need is quiet\n\nAnd I know what I need, what I need is hiding\n\nI'm just a face, someone passing in the street\n\nPaint on a smile so that no one ever sees\n\n'Cause what I need, what I need is quiet\n\nAnd I know what I need, what I need is hiding\n\n\n\nTalk to me, they all talk to me, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nTalk to me, they all talk to me, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nIt's easy for me to stay quiet\n\nAnd not speak a word\n\nBut if I do, and the truth might emerge\n\nThe mind that choose to feel\n\nNobody can poison my feelings if they're never revealed\n\nI watch others live and laugh\n\nAnd I'll just destroy the chaos in my way\n\nI have the control\n\nSo I keep what's mine, I can have with your soul\n\nAnd live with contempt, free from fear\n\nI choose my actions\n\nI'm the gatekeeper\n\n\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nHurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nJust give me mercy 'cause I keep hurting, hurting\n\nHurting, hurting\n\n\n\nDon't let me down with my soul in the air\n\nDon't let me down when there's nobody here",
