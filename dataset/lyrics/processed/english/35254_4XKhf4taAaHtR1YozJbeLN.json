  "lyrics": "Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,\rDealing out the cards from left to right,\rAnd the King of Hearts is there to remind me\rThat I'm all alone playing solitaire.\rLove was just another game for two,\rI see now that's all it meant to you,\rAnd my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,\rSo I'm all alone playing solitaire\rIn each romance there's an element of chance,\rA gamble to win or to lose,\rYou play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,\rJust made for fools.\rNow, the Joker has a laugh on me,\r'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,\rAnd until you wanna share that old feeling,\rI'll be dealing time away with solitaire.\rAnd until you want to share that old feeling,\rI'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire.",
