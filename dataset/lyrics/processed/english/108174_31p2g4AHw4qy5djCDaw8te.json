  "lyrics": "I lost ten points just for being in the right place \nat exactly the wrong time \nI looked right at the facts there, but I may as well have \nbeen completely blind \nSo, if you see me walking all alone \nDon't look back, I'm just on my way back home \n\nthere's a train leaves here this morning, and \n\nI don't know, what I might be on \n\nShe signed me to a contract, baby said it would \n\nall be so life long \n\nI looked around then for a reason \n\nwhen there wasn't something more to blame it on \n\nBut, if time makes a difference while we're gone \n\nTell me now, and I won't be hanging on \n\nThere's a train leaves here this morning \n\nand I don't know, what I might be on \n\nooo, ooo, ooo.. etc... \n\n1320 North Columbus was the address \n\nthat I wrote down on my sleeve \n\nI don't know just what she wanted \n\nmight have been that it was getting time to leave \n\nand I watched as the smoker passed it on \n\nand I laughed when the joker said, \"Lead on.\" \n\ncause there's a train leaves here this morning \n\nand I don't know, what I might be on \n\nAnd there's train leaves here this morning \n\nand I don't know, what I might be on",
