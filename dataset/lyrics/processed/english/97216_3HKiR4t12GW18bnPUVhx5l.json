  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Island par Seven Lions\r\nI've been trying to roll like a stone into your island (Oh, oh)\nBut everywhere I go, only echoes in the silence (Oh, oh)\nYou don't even know, you don't even show your diamonds (Oh, oh)\nWhere the fuck are you? Always leave me in the blindness\n\nBut I know it's not over\nFeel the static, I can feel you getting closer\nSend a flare to light the way\nOh, oh (Oh, mmm)\nOh, oh (Oh, yeah, yeah)\n\nHolding out for you is like a drop into the ocean (Oh, oh)\n\nLost between the waves, treading water, but I'm open (Oh, oh)\nThat you might come around, fix the poison now, let's forget (Oh, oh)\nShadows in the dark, need your light to break 'em open\n\nBut I know it's not over\nFeel the static, I can feel you getting closer\nSend a flare to light the way\nOh, oh\nOh, oh\nWay onto your island\n\nOh, oh\nOh, oh\nWay onto your island\n(Your island)\n\n\nI've been trying to roll like a stone into your island (Oh, oh)\nBut everywhere I go, only echoes in the silence (Oh, oh)\nYou don't even know, you don't even show your diamonds (Oh, oh)\nWhere the fuck are you? Always leave me in the blindness\n\nBut I know it's not over\nFeel the static, I can feel you getting closer\nSend a flare to light the way\nOh, oh\nOh, oh\nWay onto your island\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh",
