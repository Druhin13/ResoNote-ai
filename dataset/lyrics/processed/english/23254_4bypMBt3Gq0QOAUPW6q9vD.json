  "lyrics": "Well you say, you won\r\nYou'll work until the work is done\r\nI don't see you lift a hand\r\nTo help out one of your fellow man\r\nAnd they're using us up again\n\nBut I won't be no puppet on a string\n\n\n\nYour wheels on fire\n\nYour one desire\n\nIs to roll and rule over everyone\n\nCome on let them do it\n\nWe see right through it\n\nYou can roll and rule\n\nBut we will overcome\n\n\n\nYou say, you won\n\nThe talk until all the talk is done\n\nI see you move your mouth\n\nBut I hear nothing of any weight come out\n\n\n\nAnd you're calling\n\nOn out the [?] again\n\nYou're talking, talking\n\nBut you're not really saying anything\n\n\n\nYour wheels on fire\n\nYour one desire\n\nIs to bend and twist every little thing we've done\n\nGo on and do it\n\nWe see right through it\n\nYou can bend and twist\n\nAnd we'll be holding strong\n\n\n\nYou're building us up just to tear us down\n\nYou think that nothing's gonna stop you now\n\nBut I hear you're preaching from a nervous throne\n\n\n\nYour wheels on fire\n\nYour one desire\n\nIs to point and push your will on everyone\n\nGo on and do it\n\nIt's so like you\n\nYou can point and push\n\nBut we will overcome\n\n\n\nYour wheels on fire\n\nYour one desire\n\nIs to [?] and twist[?]\n\nGo on and try it\n\nBut no-one buys it\n\nYou can turn and twist\n\nBut we will overcome\n\n\n\nWe will overcome",
