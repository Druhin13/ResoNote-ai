  "lyrics": "It's like a song\r\nIt's like a prayer\r\nIt's like a dream you had one night\r\nAnd put it over there\r\nYou wear it like a face\n\nYou never seen before\n\nYou keep it with a key you thought you found\n\nWas lyin' on the floor\n\n\n\nWipe away the tear\n\nThat only comes with peace\n\nWipe it with a rose of love you saw\n\nWas falling on the leaves\n\n\n\nDo it like a dance\n\nDo it for a while\n\nBut when it's gone, you know it's gone\n\nYou walk another mile\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful dream\n\nA beautiful night\n\nIt's a beautiful world\n\nWhen we dance in the light\n\nAll that is real\n\nAnd all that is mine is right\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful dream\n\nA beautiful night\n\nIt's a beautiful world\n\nAnd all that is mine is right\n\n\n\nI'm blinded by the light\n\nI try to catch my breath\n\nI sing a song of love, and you can teach\n\nMe what you know of death\n\n\n\nIt's walking in your dreams\n\nIt's written in the sky\n\nAnd when you feel the heat, you know\n\nYou've found the reason why\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful dream\n\nA beautiful night\n\nIt's a beautiful world\n\nWhen we dance in the light\n\nAll that is real\n\nAnd all that is mine is right\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful dream\n\nA beautiful night\n\nA beautiful world\n\nAnd all that is mine is right\n\n\n\nAttention, attention!\n\nMesdames, messieurs\n\nAccrochez-vous bien et faites vos adieux\n\nL'humanité est en train de fondre aux deux pôles\n\n\n\nAttention, attention!\n\nMesdames, messieurs\n\nLes frontières se referment\n\nInspirez, expirez monoxyde de carbone\n\n\n\nDétendez-vous et reposez en paix\n\nC'est juste la fin du monde, c'est juste la fin du monde\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful dream\n\nA beautiful night\n\nIt's a beautiful world\n\nAnd we dance in the light\n\nAnd all that is real\n\nAnd all that is mine is right\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful dream\n\nA beautiful night\n\nIt's a beautiful world\n\nWhen we dance in the light\n\nAll that is real\n\nAnd all that is mine is right\n\nAll that is mine is right\n\nAll that is mine is right\n\nAll that is mine is right\n\nAll that is mine is right",
