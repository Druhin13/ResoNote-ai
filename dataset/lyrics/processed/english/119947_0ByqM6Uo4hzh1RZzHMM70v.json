(Could have known)\nCouldn't listen to advice 'cause I'm never wrong (oh)\nIn the spotlight, but I'm on my own (oh)\nNow they're all gone (now they're all gone)\n\nAll this stuntin' couldn't set this fire, my soul\nGot a hundred big faces, but I'm still alone\n\nAyy, I would throw it all away\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay\nYou ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy\nYou know I would throw it all away\n\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay\nPrice went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay, ayy, ayy\n\nI don't even wanna go home\nIn a big house all alone (all alone)\nI don't even wanna go home (no, no, no)\nI'ma try to call you on the phone\nBrrt\n\nAyy, I would throw it all away\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay\nYou ain't never cared about that bullshit anyway\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) ayy\n\nYou know I would throw it all away\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay)\nPrice went up, my price went up, we went our separate ways (separate ways)\nI just keep on wishin' that the money made you stay (made you stay) ayy, ayy",
