  "lyrics": "On this fragile dot\r\nOn it everyone you love\r\nHow can we live in such discordance?\r\nWe’re all made up of atoms\r\nWe’re all made up of hope\n\nWe’ll only cross this distance\n\nIf we pull on the same side of the same rope\n\n\n\nLook up\n\nAnd see the stars\n\nFeel\n\nHow tiny we are\n\nWe could live with perfect ease\n\n\n\nLook up\n\nAnd see the stars\n\nFeel\n\nHow tiny we are\n\nWe could even catch our dreams\n\n\n\nThere are men with money in their hearts\n\nFull of fear and many broken parts\n\nTheir only thought is\n\n“Me first! Me first! Me first! Me first!”\n\n\n\nLook up\n\nAnd see the stars\n\nFeel\n\nHow tiny we are\n\nWe could live with perfect ease\n\n\n\nLook up\n\nAnd see the stars\n\nFeel\n\nHow tiny we are\n\nWe could even catch our dreams\n\n\n\nWe’re all made up of atoms\n\nWe’re all made up of hope\n\nWe’ll only cross this distance\n\nIf we pull on the same side of the same rope",
