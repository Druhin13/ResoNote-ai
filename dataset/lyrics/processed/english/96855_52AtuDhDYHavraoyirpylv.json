  "lyrics": "So I've lost my way looking for a sign\r\nI should slip away, mystery of time\r\nAnd now the quiet hours stay a little longer\r\nTill the darker days come and go again\r\nAnd they say I'll be fine again\n\n\n\nPlease just tell me it's only temporary\n\nWhen I'm here feeling ordinary\n\nNo, don't try and hold me\n\nIf you're gonna hold me back\n\nJust tell me it's only temporary\n\n\n\nSo I've changed my mind, see it differently\n\nOn the other side they're not listening to me\n\n'Cause when the ropes all break, nothing's gonna catch\n\nWith my hands untied is anything the same?\n\n\n\nJust tell me it's only temporary\n\nWhen I'm here feeling ordinary\n\nNo, don't try and hold me\n\nIf you're gonna hold me back\n\nJust tell me it's only temporary\n\n\n\nAll the water is running\n\nAll the water is running\n\nAll the water is running out\n\nDo you see that it's coming?\n\nDo you see that it's coming?\n\nDo you see that it's coming now?\n\n\n\nJust tell me it's only temporary\n\nWhen I'm here feeling ordinary\n\nNo, don't try and hold me\n\nIf you're gonna hold me back\n\nJust tell me it's only temporary",
