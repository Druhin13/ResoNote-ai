  "lyrics": "Dive into the land of papercuts and ink stained cufflinks\r\nThese words open doors\r\nKeep a record of your receipts\r\nTo remind you of the joy of the sunset escape\r\nThe poem will bring you down\n\nYour hatreds float away like butterflies\n\nAnd maybe you'll read this tonight\n\nGain credence through what you'll recite\n\n\n\nDust the page often\n\nTake your time\n\n\n\nThough it seems a constant duel\n\nWhen you feed yourself the words that open up the child in you\n\nGrab the bourbon from the shelf\n\nThis moment needs to be cemented, cemented\n\n\n\nThe poem will bring you down\n\nYour hatreds float away like butterflies\n\nAnd maybe you'll read this tonight\n\nGain credence through what you'll recite\n\nAnd maybe you'll read this tonight\n\n\n\nDust the page often\n\nTake your time",
