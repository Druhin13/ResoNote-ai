  "lyrics": "Long live the journey\r\nAnd long live the children we raise\r\nLong live the memories like leaves the years carried away\r\nJust like a tree that slowly grows\r\nThe higher we reach the deeper we go\r\nWe're living for something that'll be here when we're old\n\nAnd we're headed for some place a little further down the road\n\n\n\nRedwoods and Daisies never look worried to me\n\nThey take what's been given\n\nAs if that's all they'll ever need\n\nAnd if that's all they'll ever need\n\nMaybe that's all we really need\n\nWe're living for something that'll be here when we're old\n\nAnd we're headed for some place a little further down the road\n\n\n\nSome people reason for living is to get all they can and move on\n\nBut I find more grace in what's given\n\nBecause it leads me to where I belong\n\nElders are people who hold law and grace in their hands\n\nWhere death is a doorway\n\nAnd falling's just learning to stand\n\nAnd less is more than we really need\n\nAnd empty's a space for us to receive\n\nWe're living for something that'll be here when we're old\n\nAnd we're headed for some place a little further down the road",
