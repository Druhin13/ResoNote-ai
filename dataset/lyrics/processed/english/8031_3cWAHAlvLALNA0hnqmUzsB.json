  "lyrics": "I've been praying for something\r\nWarm sheets and a bad diagnosis\r\nAnd I'm still sitting here, stoned and at home\r\nI've been desperate to find it\r\nWarm eyes and two hands to revive this\n\nBecause I'm still sitting here, bored and alone\n\nStoned and at home\n\n\n\nI wanted love\n\nI wanted something to call my own\n\nI wanted love\n\nI wanted something to bring back home\n\n\n\nYou'd say I'm a sapphire in pieces\n\nAnd slowly, I'd start to believe it\n\nBecause I'm still sitting here, stoned and at home\n\n\n\nSometimes the struggle's enticing\n\nThe world stares in judgement inside me\n\nAnd I'm still sitting here bored and alone\n\n\n\nI wanted love\n\nI wanted something to call my own\n\nI wanted love\n\nI wanted something to bring back home\n\nI wanted trust\n\nI wanted something to call my own\n\nYou let me down\n\nI guess that's something to bring back home",
