  "lyrics": "Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor\r\nReaching for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore\r\nAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind???\r\nFor me it happens all the time\r\nIt's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now\n\nSaid I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now\n\nAnd I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now\n\n\n\nAnother shot of whiskey can't stop looking at the door\n\nWishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before\n\nAnd I wonder if I ever cross your mind???\n\nFor me it happens all the time\n\n\n\nIt's a quarter after one I'm a little drunk and I need you now\n\nSaid I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now\n\nAnd I don't know how I can do without I just need you now\n\n\n\nGuess I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all\n\n\n\nIt's a quarter after one I'm all alone and I need you now\n\nAnd I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now\n\nAnd I don't know how I can do without I just need you now\n\nI just need you now\n\nOh baby I need you now",
