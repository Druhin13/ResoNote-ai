  "lyrics": "Waking up on the floor\r\nWith no one else in the room\r\nI never felt like this before\r\nI just hope I'm leaving soon\r\nAnd if tomorrow I don't wake up\n\nJust know I really tried to make the best of your forgiveness\n\n\n\nTell me one last time\n\nHow I never tried\n\n\n\nWas so close to breaking through last time\n\nThought that I'd be sheltered\n\nBy nothingness, by the lack of consciousness\n\n\n\nBut I lay here awake\n\nToo afraid to dream\n\nCause if I might have to face myself, I'll buckle at my knees\n\n\n\nTell me one last time\n\nHow I never tried\n\n\n\nI've seen the light\n\nBut never felt this close\n\nPushed my pain aside\n\nCause I could never give it to those\n\n\n\nCause I never see the point in sharing defeat\n\nDisplaying my debts to the world\n\nI just live in repeat, vacant and desperate\n\n\n\nTell me one last time\n\nHow I never tried\n\nAnd if tomorrow I don't wake up\n\nJust know I really tried to make the best of your forgiveness\n\nAnd tell my brother he'll be fine",
