  "lyrics": "She said, \"It's time to teach you the art of love.\"\r\nShe said, \"We're gonna reach to the heart of love\r\nA place you never knew;\r\nA place that lives somewhere inside of you.\"\r\nI know I'm on a journey I won't forget \n\nI know I had it in me to give and yet I never could before \n\nI had to, if I wanted to be yours.\n\n\n\nYou made me see I'd have to be a brand new man\n\nHe lives in me, so here in me is where I began.\n\n\n\nYou showed the kind of lesson I can't erase\n\nYou showed a way to get from that lonely place\n\nTo where love comes alive\n\nAnd you'd be waiting there when I arrive.\n\n\n\nThe truth was clear\n\nLove's not a place you go to find\n\nIt lives in here\n\nJust leave it space, give it time\n\n\n\nI learned that I could stumble and maybe fall\n\nI learned in being humble I'd have it all\n\nA brand new way to live\n\nThat love's not what you have but what you give\n\nAnd the art of love is who you share it with.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Jim Davidson for these lyrics)",
