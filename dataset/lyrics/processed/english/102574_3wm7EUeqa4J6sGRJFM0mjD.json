  "lyrics": "Metamorphosis; what am I becoming\r\nLiable; or a victim of circumstance?\r\nBending disorder to appease my own defense\r\nThis bond could not be conceived without affection and faith to\r\nBelieve\n\nIt was all meant to endure the worst of things\n\nCast aside your doubts and destructive thoughts\n\nI know that I can finally be enough\n\n\n\nThe signal fire is flickering\n\nBreaths start to cease, and I wonder if she calls my name out from the edge of the sea\n\n\n\nTones of crimson gleam to fill the space between the animation in my arteries\n\nCruel impermanence; the weight of the unknown has stricken me with a feeling of turbulence; holding out for a softer consequence\n\n\n\nStand true; we are absolute\n\nThe doubt breathes through blushing leaves\n\nBe eradicated with my will to be\n\nConvoluted ideas and emotions that make their home in me, weigh me down\n\nThey make their home in me\n\n\n\nDrifting away into the comfort of false safety\n\n\n\nThe signal fire is flickering\n\nBreaths start to cease, and I wonder if she calls my name out from the edge of the sea\n\n\n\nMove in sync with passage of light through my fingertips\n\nAligned on each notch of my spine where shivers wonâ€™t\n\nDare resist\n\n\n\nThe signal fire is flickering\n\nBreaths start to cease, and I wonder if she calls my name out from the edge of the sea",
