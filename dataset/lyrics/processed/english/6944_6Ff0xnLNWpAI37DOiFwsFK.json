  "lyrics": "I gave you my everything, but it was never enough for you\r\nAnd just like young lovers do, we made mistakes we can't undo\r\nWhatever I do for you, you will never be satisfied\r\nYou wade in my waters, 'til the dying of the tide\r\nI'll give you heaven\n\nI'll give you hell\n\nI'm raising my huntsmen\n\nI'm casting my spell\n\nAnd if I all I have is to be wasted away\n\nI'll save myself tonight\n\nI can't take the pain\n\n\n\nI will forgive you, but I won't forget\n\nI will forgive you, for the burden and neglect\n\nI will forgive you, no I can not forget\n\nAnd I will outlive you\n\nI am the architect\n\n\n\nOh, if you stop hurting me\n\nThen I'll have some time to heal\n\nSo try to be tender, now\n\n'Cause the darkness feels so real\n\n\n\nI'll give you heaven\n\nI'll give you hell\n\nI'm raising my huntsmen\n\nI'm casting my spell\n\nAnd if I all I have is to be wasted away\n\nI'll save myself tonight\n\nI can't take the pain\n\n\n\nI will forgive you, but I won't forget\n\nI will forgive you, for the burden and neglect\n\nI will forgive you, no I can not forget\n\nAnd I will outlive you\n\nI am the architect\n\n\n\nAnd I know I will love again\n\nGive my heart again\n\nYou better believe it\n\nGoodnight, my beautiful nightmare\n\nSleep sweet, no more despair\n\nYou better believe it\n\n\n\nThat I will forgive you, but I won't forget\n\nI will forgive you, for the burden and neglect\n\nI will forgive you, and I can not forget\n\nAnd I will outlive you\n\nI am the architect\n\n\n\nI am the architect",
