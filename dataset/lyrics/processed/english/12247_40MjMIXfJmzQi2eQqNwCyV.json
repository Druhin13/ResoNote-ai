  "lyrics": "My ears ring, my head's on fire\r\nAir gets thin like I'm up on the wire\r\nWorld stands still like I'm passin' it by\r\nGot to grab 'hold of somethin' droppin' out of the sky\r\nI got to step across every mine\n\nI like a high time every time\n\nYou were lookin' for a straighter line\n\nLook at me, I'm the crooked kind\n\nI'm the crooked kind\n\n\n\nCount the days you logged the miles\n\nKeep it all in place and right in style\n\nYou forgot the way, you lost the key\n\nYou don't have to outrun the bail, brother, you got to outrun me\n\n\n\nI got to step across every mine\n\nI like a high time every time\n\nYou were lookin' for a straighter line\n\nLook at me, I'm the crooked kind\n\nI'm the crooked kind\n\n\n\nThere ain't a whole lot to say\n\nJust gets in my way\n\nIt's all here by design\n\nTo help me lose my mind\n\n\n\nI got to step across every mine\n\nI like a high time every time\n\nYou were lookin' for a straighter line\n\nLook at me, I'm the crooked kind\n\n\n\nI got to step across every mine\n\nI like a high time every time\n\nYou were lookin' for a straighter line\n\nLook at me, I'm the crooked kind\n\nI'm the crooked kind\n\nHey, I'm the crooked kind\n\nI'm the crooked kind",
