  "lyrics": "We wanted to know when we'd be free\r\nWhat life looked like on the other side of that sanctuary\r\nBelievin' somehow we'd make them proud\r\nKnowin' the sins they made and figuring we could stay on common ground\r\nCigarette smoke in an August sky\n\nDrinkin' the beers you convinced your older brother to buy\n\nWe hadn't make any of our mistakes\n\nOur world was in the cradle but innocence was[/wasn't?] in the grave\n\n\n\nAnd I know we can't go back in time\n\nBut every now and then you look at me and I know you wonder why\n\nWe can't get back to when September was our only adversary\n\nIn the lot behind St. Mary's\n\n\n\nWell I thought I'd be all you'd need\n\nBut your heart was in the dark and mine was in the weeds\n\nI'm sure the dreamer who built the first trapeze\n\nFell in love with someone who grew to resent the goddamn thing\n\n\n\nAnd I know we can't go back in time\n\nBut every now and then you look at me as if to wonder why\n\nWe can't get back to the love we made before our teenage dreams were buried\n\nIn the lot behind St. Mary's\n\nSt. Mary's\n\n\n\nA nightlight glowed in the rectory\n\nWe told ourselves the pastor must be sound asleep\n\nBut now we're old enough to know he never slept\n\nAnd that God's love is almighty, but our love is just bones and flesh\n\n\n\nAnd I know we can't go back in time\n\nBut every now and then you you reach for me and I close my eyes and try\n\nTo get back to that summer and the blue jeans we were wearin'\n\nIn the lot behind St. Mary's\n\nSt. Mary's",
