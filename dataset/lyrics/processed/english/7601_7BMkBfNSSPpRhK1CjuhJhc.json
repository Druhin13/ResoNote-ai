  "lyrics": "Standing on the border \nLooking out into the great unknown \nI can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own \nThere's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind \nI'm heading out tonight, traveling light \nI'm gonna start all over again \n\n\n\nAnd buy a one way ticket on a west bound train \n\nSee how far I can go (Because I can) \n\nI'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain \n\nAnd talk to someone I don't know (Because I can) \n\nI will face the world around me \n\nKnowing that I'm strong enough to let you go \n\nAnd I will fall in love again \n\nBecause I can \n\n\n\nGonna climb the mountain \n\nAnd look the eagle in the eye \n\nI won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly \n\nHow could I have ever believed \n\nThat love had to be so blind \n\nWhen freedom was waiting, down at the station \n\nAll I had to do was make up my mind \n\n\n\nAnd buy a one way ticket on a west bound train \n\nSee how far I can go (Because I can) \n\nI'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain \n\nAnd talk to someone I don't know (Because I can) \n\nI will face the world around me \n\nKnowing that I'm strong enough to let you go \n\nAnd I will fall in love again \n\nBecause I can \n\n\n\nWell, I have walked through the fire \n\nAnd crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt \n\nThen the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out \n\n\n\nI'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train \n\nSee how far I can go (Because I can) \n\nI'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain \n\nAnd talk to someone I don't know \n\nI'm gonna buy a one way ticket on a west bound train \n\nGonna have my breakfest with some pink champagne \n\nI'm gonna sail the ocean, I'm gonna spread my wings \n\nI'm gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything",
