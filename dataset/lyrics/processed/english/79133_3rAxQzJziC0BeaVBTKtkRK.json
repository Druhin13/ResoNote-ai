  "lyrics": "I was the boy unwanted, a prisoner I'm born to them\r\nMy brother was the one, the couldn't do no wrong\r\nAnd I was there dying in the shadow of him\r\nRed, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?\r\nFeel the strap, cross my back\n\nYeah I'm the new whipping boy\n\nWho am I - the orphan son you would never need?\n\nWho am I - cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees\n\nWho am I - the slave you gave just the air I breathe?\n\nWho am I - cause I'm the boy only the mirror sees\n\n\n\nOh I got the same old reruns, horror movies in my head\n\nAnd I can't rest, the scare me to death\n\nBut if I'm not alive, how can I be dead?\n\n\n\nRed, crimson red, am I the invisible boy?\n\n\n\nFeel the strap, cross my back\n\nYeah I'm the new whipping boy\n\n\n\nOh, why me?\n\nThe mirror\n\nWhy him\n\n\n\nCan you tell me?\n\n\n\nIt's confession again?\n\nCome talk to me, I see in your eyes\n\nTitantic misery, ashamed that you're alive\n\nI'm the face that you see\n\nWhen the face isn't yours\n\nI'm the mirror my boy",
