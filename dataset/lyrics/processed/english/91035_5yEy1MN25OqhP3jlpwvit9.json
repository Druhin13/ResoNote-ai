  "lyrics": "Most of the time, I can't shut my damn mouth\r\nAnd most of the time, my heart's too proud\r\nI push 'em away, as quick as they came\r\nI live and run away\r\nMost of my life, I've lived on the dark side\n\nAnd most of my nights, I smoke and drink too much\n\nI've broken hearts once or twice\n\nThis time it feels like\n\n\n\nLiving on the edge, falling fast and hard\n\nFollow your life, it ain't falling apart\n\nLike a clock striking midnight you never saw coming\n\nBut it's right on time, and it stops you running\n\nLeave it to me, you play the fool\n\nWho thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof\n\nIt takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth\n\nBut letting go of all of that means holding onto you\n\n\n\nAin't too many bridges that I ain't burned\n\nAin't too many reasons you should be here\n\nIt's either luck or God, and I don't care\n\nWhoever's there, heard my prayers\n\n\n\nLiving on the edge, falling fast and hard\n\nFollow your life, it ain't falling apart\n\nLike a clock striking midnight you never saw coming\n\nBut it's right on time, and it stops you running\n\nLeave it to me, you play the fool\n\nWho thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof\n\nIt takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth\n\nBut letting go of all of that means holding onto you\n\n\n\nHolding onto you\n\nIt's almost like you were staying here to save me\n\nAnd you saved me\n\n\n\nLiving on the edge, falling fast and hard\n\nFollow your life, it ain't falling apart\n\nLike a clock striking midnight you never saw coming\n\nBut it's right on time, and it stops you running\n\nLeave it to me, you play the fool\n\nWho thinks numbing the pain makes you bulletproof\n\nIt takes hell and a lie to lead to the truth\n\nBut letting go of all of that means holding onto you\n\n\n\nI'm holding onto you\n\nIt's almost like you were staying here to save me\n\nAnd you saved me",
