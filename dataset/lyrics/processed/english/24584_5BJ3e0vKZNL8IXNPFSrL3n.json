  "lyrics": "Forbidden fields\r\nAnd empty meadows\r\nI wind and wander\r\nTo pierce the seal\r\nAnd loose the shadow\n\nThat pulls me under\n\n\n\nPlaces that should not be disturbed\n\n\n\nAll that I would cast away\n\nWatching giants fall\n\nFrom myself or from another\n\nDrain the spirit of its colour\n\nBleeding into grey\n\nCrumble to the ground\n\nA titan coming down\n\n\n\nCycle begins, to atone I will bear the crown\n\nTwins of the curse on the brow pull the future down\n\nGiants heavy hewn from the grain of eternity\n\nPiercing the wound to escape from a destiny\n\n\n\nWhat have I become?\n\n\n\nAll that I would cast away\n\nWatching giants fall\n\nFrom myself or from another\n\nDrain the spirit of its colour\n\nBleeding into grey\n\nCrumble to the ground\n\nA titan coming down\n\n\n\nAll that I would cast away\n\nWatching giants fall\n\nIn a choking fog I smother (I'm smothering)\n\nDrain the spirit of its colour\n\nBleeding into grey\n\nCrumble to the ground\n\nA titan coming down",
