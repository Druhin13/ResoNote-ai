  "lyrics": "These dirt roads ain’t gold down there\r\nIt's hell on earth, anything goes down here\r\nLookin' for some holy water at the water hole\r\nBut all I'm ﬁndin' is whiskey and beer\r\nAnd I’m a sinner, I’m a sinner to the core\r\nSearchin' like the devil, to ﬁnd the Lord, yeah\n\nHeaven knows I need help sometimes\n\nCause I love to have a hell of a time\n\nI said, I’m a sinner, I'm a sinner, Lord save me\n\nBut please pour me up a drink before you take me\n\nIf you can turn water into wine\n\nI’m sure you make a hell of a shine, yea\n\n\n\nI can’t help it Lord, yea\n\nI’m sinnin' every day\n\nI need your help and I pray, Amen\n\nI’m climbin' to the top of that mountain\n\nI’m tryin' to ﬁnd you God\n\nKeep tryin' to be an angel, but still, raisin' hell (hell)\n\n\n\nCan’t make it out this world alive\n\nI just want a piece of heaven, before I die\n\nSo pass me the apple pie\n\nI’m gonna drink it all down, 'til the jar goes dry\n\nBaptized in the lake of ﬁre\n\nShould have drowned me when you could, but I’m still alive\n\nI’m comin' for your ass like a bat outta hell\n\nYou can bet I’m gonna take what’s mine, oh\n\nPreacher man gonna preach to me\n\nYou should pull up a chair and have a drink with me\n\nSweatin' like the devil with the lies you told\n\nYou better start prayin' to save your soul, oh no\n\n\n\nI can’t help it Lord, yea\n\nI’m sinnin' every day. I need your help and I pray, Amen\n\nI’m climbing to the top of that mountain\n\nI’m tryin' to ﬁnd you God\n\nKeep tryin' to be an angel, but still, raising hell (hell, hell)",
