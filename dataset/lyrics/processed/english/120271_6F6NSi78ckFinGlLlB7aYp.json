  "lyrics": "He wakes with the chickens and the Waco sun\r\nHe's got mouths to feed and cattle to run\r\nSame as his daddy and his daddy done\r\nIt's all he's ever known\r\nIn this modern world movin' break-neck fast\r\nHe's a dyin' breed, a thing of the past\n\nHe'll be damned if he don't hit back\n\nIf you stand in his way\n\nWhen there's nothin' more to say\n\n\n\nSo here's to the lifers\n\nThe struggle-and-strifers\n\nWorkin' long after the day is done\n\nHere's to the broke-backs\n\nThe cowboys in old hats\n\nThe last of the Great Generation\n\nIt seems they still dream\n\n\n\nShe's a renaissance girl with a fire in her soul\n\nShe's got a pocket full of nothin', nobody tells her \"no\"\n\nShe flew into town twenty years ago\n\nWith a guitar and a song\n\nShe's been playin' them rooms but she ain't got far\n\nBeen livin' off tips in them Broadway bars\n\nShe's a troubadour queen but time left its mark\n\n[The scene's ?] passed her by\n\nIn a world that's passed her by\n\n\n\nSo here's to the lifers\n\nThe struggle-and-strifers\n\nWorkin' long after the day is done\n\nHere's to the broke-backs\n\nThe cowboys in old hats\n\nThe last of the Great Generation\n\nIt seems they still dream\n\n\n\nNo, they don't give up and they don't give in\n\nWhen things don't go their way\n\nYeah we're gettin' knocked down, yeah we're gettin' back up\n\nLive to die another day\n\n\n\nSo here's to the lifers\n\nThe struggle-and-strifers\n\nWorkin' long after the day is done\n\nHere's to the broke-backs\n\nThe cowboys in old hats\n\nThe last of the Great Generation\n\nIt seems they still dream",
