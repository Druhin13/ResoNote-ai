  "lyrics": "Meanwhile the scientist, pounding on his skull his skull two blew themselves away working on it\r\nIn storms the general grabbed him by his collar\r\n\"Well you old crackpot, what have you got to say?\"\r\nIn an open field, man is guilty always\n\nMud is yellow and the ground is moving\n\nSun is yellow and the ground is moving. The ground is moving\n\n\n\nThe century turned and your old man stumbled in\n\nSaying \"Of course I am for peace\n\nOne that suits me.\"\n\n\n\nFor the first time the captain's at my side\n\nLook now, here the Padre comes\n\nHere he comes\n\nAbout to go on his lunchbreak\n\n\"Son you and I both know the real criminal is time\n\nI understand your crime but just what makes you think you've got the right to be young?\"\n\n\n\nIn an open field man is guilty always\n\n\n\nThe century turned and your old man stumbled in\n\nThe century turned and your old man stumbled in saying -\n\n\"Of course I am for peace\n\nOne that suits me.\"\n\n\n\nAnd now the mother of them all\n\nShe is just about to fall\n\nIn the history of man, reality becomes softened",
