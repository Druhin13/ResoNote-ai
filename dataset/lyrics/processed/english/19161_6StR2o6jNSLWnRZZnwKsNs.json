  "lyrics": "Say we could go where our dreams are realized\r\nWe make the little sacrifice\r\nIt's a secret hallelujah\r\nParadise with all its hidden sights\r\nHas to question is sometimes\r\nI just want to see it clearer\n\nWhen it feels like\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere to run, run, run\n\nThere's nowhere to hide\n\nFrom the hurtful divide in this world\n\nThere's nowhere to run, run, run\n\nRun, run, run, run away\n\n\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\n\n\nOn this road your beliefs can fade away\n\nI'm only offering what I may\n\nI just hope we find it sooner\n\nNot alone, we've all felt out of place\n\nJust a shade in the human race\n\nAnd I can look right through ya\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere to run, run, run\n\nThere's nowhere to hide\n\nFrom the hurtful divide in this world\n\nThere's nowhere to run, run, run\n\nRun, run, run, run away\n\n\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\n\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\n\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nI've been dreaming again\n\nAbout the revolution in my head\n\nI've been dreaming again",
