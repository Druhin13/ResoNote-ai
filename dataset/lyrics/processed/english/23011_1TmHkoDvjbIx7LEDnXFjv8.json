  "lyrics": "Sitting here staring, studying your brown eyes\r\nWishing you would say the right thing\r\nI'm always the one talking, but it's getting exhausting\r\nI'm starting to wonder if it's me\r\nWhy's it so hard to open your mouth?\n\n(Use your words)\n\nCome on, say something\n\nBaby, I can't read your mind\n\n(Use your words)\n\nTell me what you're feeling\n\nYou're running out of time\n\n(Use your words)\n\nAnd I don't wanna give up, but I know that it isn't enough\n\n(Use your words)\n\nUse your words\n\n\n\nWhy you gotta shut down, get fired up and walk out\n\nAnd take everything personally?\n\nIs it your pride or ego?\n\n'Round and 'round we go\n\nYou can't keep saying that you're sorry\n\nWhy's it so hard to fill me in?\n\n\n\n(Use your words)\n\nCome on, say something\n\nBaby, I can't read your mind\n\n(Use your words)\n\nTell me what you're feeling\n\nYou're running out of time\n\n(Use your words)\n\nAnd I don't wanna give up, but I know that it isn't enough\n\n(Use your words)\n\nUse your words\n\n\n\nSitting here staring, studying your brown eyes\n\nWishing you would say the right thing\n\n\n\n(Use your words)\n\nCome on, say something\n\nBaby, I can't read your mind\n\n(Use your words)\n\nTell me what you're feeling\n\nYou're running out of time\n\n(Use your words)\n\nAnd I don't wanna give up, but I know that it isn't enough\n\n(Use your words)\n\nUse your words",
