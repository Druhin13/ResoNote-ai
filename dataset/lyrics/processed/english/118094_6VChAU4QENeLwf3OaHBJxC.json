  "lyrics": "No I'm not goin' crazy, but lately my head and my heart\r\nSeem to be at least a million miles apart\r\nMy heart says to love ya, my head says to run\r\nIt's like my heart is to afraid to tell my head when it's done\r\nI know that it can never be the way it was\r\nEven though you'll be the death of me I can't give you up\n\nToo much is not enough; it's not the love, it's not the lust that grips me\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\n\n\nI've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget\n\nI got \"I love you\" on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath\n\nAnd loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\n\n\nNo I'm not goin' crazy, but lately these thoughts in my head\n\nAre a whirlwind of a world of a million regrets\n\nAll the things I should've done, all the things I should've said\n\nAll the pain that comes with hatin' the mess you've made of yourself\n\nI know I'm chasin' rainbows thinkin' I could make it work\n\nBut the fact is that my actions speak louder than my words\n\nAnd it only makes it worse thinkin' of her, thinkin' she'll forgive me\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\n\n\nI've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget\n\nI got \"I love you\" on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath\n\nAnd loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\n\n\nI've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget\n\nI got \"I love you\" on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath\n\nAnd loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me\n\nSometimes it hits me whenever I'm a little tipsy\n\nOh, it hits me whenever I'm a little tipsy\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\n\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\nIt must be the whiskey\n\nIt's that whiskey\n\nIt must be the whiskey",
