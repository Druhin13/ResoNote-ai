  "lyrics": "I think I'm going parasailing\r\nMiles above, it’s so serene\r\nI'm letting go of all the troubles\r\nThat I've seen, that I’ve seen\r\nWay up here, no one can touch me\r\nI'm drifting like a lost balloon\n\nI'm out of reach, won't be coming down\n\nAny time soon, any time soon\n\n\n\nI'm high as a kite\n\nDon't you think they'd know what I'm worth?\n\nFlying like a beautiful bird\n\nI’m high as a kite\n\nDon’t you think they'd know what I’m worth?\n\nWhy I gotta come down to earth?\n\n\n\nI feel no pain, I feel no pleasure\n\nI only want to disappear\n\nSo let me play this game for children\n\nAnd vanish into the atmosphere\n\n\n\nI'm high as a kite\n\nDon't you think they'd know what I’m worth?\n\nFlying like a beautiful bird\n\nI'm high as a kite\n\nDon't you think they'd know what I'm worth?\n\nWhy I gotta come down to earth?\n\n\n\nWhen I'm high\n\nAnd I'm giving up the nightmare chase, oh woah woah\n\nAnd all I wanna do is blow my mind, oh woah woah\n\nAll I wanna do is blow my mind\n\nI can fly up to the stratosphere\n\nHigh above the cirrus clouds\n\nWhere I am one with the universe\n\n\n\nI'm high as a kite\n\nDon't you think they'd know what I'm worth?\n\nFlying like a beautiful bird\n\nI'm high\n\nDon't you think they'd know what I'm worth?\n\nWhy I gotta come down to earth\n\nWhen I'm high?",
