  "lyrics": "Lightyears from everyone\r\nStranded on a foreign sun\r\nBlacked out up on the edge\r\nAm I the only one out here?\r\nDazed in the daytime light\n\nFloating in a violet sky\n\nAm I the only one?\n\nThe only one around out here?\n\n\n\nOpen my eyes I see someone I used to be\n\nWhen I open my eyes, it's all coming back to me\n\n\n\nCome and take me lightyears\n\nBack to where we're from\n\nWe could be together\n\nThat's where we belong\n\n\n\nAre you out there?\n\nCome and send me a sign\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe could go wherever you like\n\n\n\nLightyears from everyone\n\nI wonder what I have I become?\n\nWashed up on a distant shore\n\nFall, but I come back for more\n\n\n\nSo fast, we're out of sight\n\nMovin' at the speed of light\n\nPumping our hearts in time\n\nBreak through the atmosphere\n\nSo high that I can't stand\n\nIt's all coming back to me\n\n\n\nCome and take me lightyears\n\nBack to where we're from\n\nWe could be together\n\nThat's where we belong\n\n\n\nAre you out there?\n\nCome and send me a sign\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe could go wherever you like\n\n\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe can make it if you're ready\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe can go all night\n\nWe can make it if you're ready\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe could go, All night\n\n\n\nCome and take me lightyears\n\n'Cause that's where we're from\n\nWe could be together\n\nThat's where we belong\n\n\n\nTell me, Are you out there?\n\nCan you send me a sign\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe could go wherever you like\n\n\n\nAs long as we're together (Night)\n\nWe can make it if you're ready\n\nAs long as we're together (Night)\n\nWe can go all night\n\nAs long as we're together (Night)\n\nWe can make it if you're ready\n\nAs long as we're together\n\nWe could go, All night",
