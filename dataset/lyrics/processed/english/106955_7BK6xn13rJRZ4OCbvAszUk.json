  "lyrics": "I fell in love on the L train\r\nHeaded somewhere north of where you are\r\nThought I knew where I was going\r\nNow I know I'm going where you are\r\nAin't gonna lie I've been drinking\n\nThat Colorado's got me stoned\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes the angels are singing\n\nLoving you ain't my decision\n\nLoving you is my religion\n\n\n\nI wanna hear what's been hurting\n\nI carve that on a bench in Central Park\n\nAnd when I showed up there the next day\n\nYou'd written your initials in a heart\n\n\n\nAin't gonna lie I've been drinking\n\nThat Colorado's got me stoned\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes the angels are singing\n\nLoving you ain't my decision\n\nLoving you is my religion\n\n\n\nI'm in love out in LA\n\nParis, Tokyo, coast to coast\n\nAnd it's you that keeps me going\n\nLove from you will always mean the most\n\n\n\nAin't gonna lie I've been drinking\n\nThat Colorado's got me stoned\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes the angels are singing\n\nLoving you ain't my decision\n\nLoving you is my religion",
