  "lyrics": "I came back from the edge — where you go when you die\r\nI fell back down to Earth through a hole in the sky\r\nI crashed into the sea, then somehow I survived\r\nDon’t know what to believe, but I know I’m alive\r\nBack from the edge\n\n\n\nI was nearly destroyed when I looked in her eyes\n\nI got lost in the void as I pondered the size\n\nI got black-brained to death, but I just wouldn’t die\n\nI came back from the edge, I came back from the edge\n\n\n\nBack from the edge\n\nBack from the edge\n\nBack from the edge\n\n\n\nI came back from the edge\n\nI came back from the edge",
