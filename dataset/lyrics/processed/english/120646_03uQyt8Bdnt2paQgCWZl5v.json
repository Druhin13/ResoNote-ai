  "lyrics": "Don't be fooled by the pink\r\nShe is not playing dolls\r\nShe is stalking the halls\r\nFor the thrill of the kill\r\nEvery person in school\r\nIs aware of her stare\n\nWhen she tosses her hair\n\nThey go perfectly still\n\nAll their eyes say, \"don't attack me.\"\n\nWatch them sweat and pant and shake\n\nEvery food chain has its acme\n\nRegina George eats steak\n\nShe's the queen of the beasts\n\nShe can smell your fear\n\nIn this biosphere\n\nShe's the apex predator\n\nAt the watering hole\n\nSee the girls who weren't nice\n\nHave to scatter like mice\n\nFrom a jungle cat\n\nAnd though Janis is great\n\nShe does not have this power\n\nPeople literally cower\n\nJanis can't do that\n\nSee us mark our territory\n\nAs I follow in her train\n\nI was victim, I was quarry\n\nNow I shake my mane\n\nShe's the queen of beasts\n\nAnd I'm in her pride\n\nI have hitched a ride\n\nWith the apex predator\n\nAnd it's kinda fun\n\nWhen she bares her claws\n\nWhen I'm safe because\n\nI'm with the apex predator\n\nDid I think I'd be protected by my new exotic pet\n\nNot a chance if she suspected\n\nI was any kind of reproductive threat\n\nBut she doesn't know yet\n\nNo, she doesn't know yet\n\nShe's the queen of beasts\n\nAt this beastly school\n\nGotta keep things cool\n\nWith the apex predator\n\nSo I'm kinda friends\n\nBut you're kind of prey\n\nJesus, what a day\n\nWith the apex predator\n\nWill she braid your hair\n\nWill she eat your heart\n\nHow can you outsmart\n\nThe apex predator\n\nLike a lionesses\n\nOnly with less fur\n\nDo not mess with her\n\nShe's the apex predator",
