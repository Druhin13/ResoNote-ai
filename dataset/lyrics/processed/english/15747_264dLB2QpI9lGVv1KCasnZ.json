  "lyrics": "Being (?) park\r\nI was sulking and regretting going out\r\nWe got to talking and I started to feel better\r\nThat stabbing hatred for you suddenly felt softer\r\nYou said it’s springtime and you’re doing a bit better\r\nYou even found yourself another brother\n\n\n\nI guess I could find one too\n\nI guess I could find one too\n\n\n\nI won’t play the victim just because I can’t get what I want\n\nI won’t play the victim just because I can’t get what I want\n\n\n\nIsn’t it nice to have a little bit of closure\n\nInstead of talking shit and throwing a cold shoulder\n\n\n\nI want to be nice to you\n\nI want to be nice to you\n\n\n\nSelf-destruction is so played out\n\nSo is self-pity and self-doubt\n\nLet’s try to be okay\n\nLet’s try to be okay\n\n\n\nI won’t play the victim just because I can’t get what I want\n\nI won’t play the victim just because I can’t get what I want\n\nI won’t play the victim just because I can’t get what I want\n\nI won’t play the victim just because I can’t get what I want\n\n\n\nOh, oh",
