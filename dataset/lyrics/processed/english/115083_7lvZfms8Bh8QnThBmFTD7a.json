  "lyrics": "What we have's the only thing worth fighting for\r\nAnd I, I won't let nothing keep us apart\r\nThrough these fallouts there is\r\nA truth and pain but through it all\r\nYou will always have my heart\n\nI see a change on the horizon\n\nReasons to be frightened\n\nI know that we can pull through\n\nI am here to tell you\n\n\n\nGet up and fight\n\nGet up and fight\n\nI can't do this thing without you\n\nI'm lost in this without you\n\nGet up and fight\n\nWe've gotta get up and fight\n\nI can't handle this without you\n\nCan't do it without you\n\n\n\nIn our heads, a million voices scream and shout\n\nAnd no one will ever hear a sound\n\nOh, only you can hush it\n\nAnd calm the turmoil and the noise\n\nAnd help me reach the higher ground\n\n\n\nI see a change on the horizon\n\nReasons to be frightened\n\nThere's nothing we can't get through\n\nI am here to tell you\n\n\n\nTo get up and fight\n\nGet up and fight\n\nI can't do this thing without you\n\nI'm lost in this without you\n\nGet up and fight\n\nWe've gotta get up and fight\n\nI can't handle this without you\n\nCan't do it without you\n\n\n\nGet up and fight\n\nGet up and fight\n\nI can't do it without you\n\n\n\nGet up and fight\n\nGet up and fight\n\nI can't do this thing without you\n\nI'm lost in this without you\n\nGet up and fight\n\nWe've gotta get up and fight\n\nI can't handle this without you\n\nCan't do it without you\n\n\n\nI can't survive without your love in my life\n\nYou've gotta get up and fight",
