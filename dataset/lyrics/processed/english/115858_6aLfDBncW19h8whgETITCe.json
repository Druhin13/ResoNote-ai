  "lyrics": "The passion of our Saviour\r\nThe mercy of our God\r\nThe cross that leaves no question\r\nOf the measure of His love\r\nOur chains are gone\n\nOur debt is paid\n\nThe cross has overthrown the grave\n\nFor Jesus' blood that sets us free\n\nMeans death to death\n\nAnd life for me\n\n\n\nThe Innocent judged guilty\n\nWhile the guilty one walks free\n\nDeath would be His portion\n\nAnd our portion liberty\n\n\n\nI give my whole life\n\nTo honour this love\n\nBy the Lamb who was slain\n\nI'm forgiven\n\nThe sinner's Saviour\n\nCrown Him forever\n\nFor the Lamb who was slain\n\nHe is risen",
