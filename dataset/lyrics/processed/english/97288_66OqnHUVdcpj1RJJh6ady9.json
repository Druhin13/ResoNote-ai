  "lyrics": "If you leave your doors unlocked\r\nIf your garage is your body shop\r\nIf your dog's got room to run\r\nYou might be from a small town\r\nAnd if you've ever kissed a girl\r\nSpinnin' 'round on a tilt-a-whirl\n\nAt the county fair in the summer sun\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\n\n\nI bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor\n\nBet you been fishin' with an old cane pole\n\nBeen cow-tippin' in a big green pasture\n\nBurned up a clutch on a red dirt road\n\nHomegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco\n\nShiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow\n\nIn the parking lot with a party crowd\n\nLittle bit of love in the truck way out\n\nIf you can't get up what I'm puttin' down\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\n\n\nIf you got a spot or two\n\nWhere you kick it with your high school crew\n\nOr you drive 30 miles for a fifth of rum\n\nYou might be from a small town, yeah\n\n\n\nI bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor\n\nBet you been fishin' with an old cane pole\n\nBeen cow-tippin' in a big green pasture\n\nBurned up a clutch on a red dirt road\n\nHomegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco\n\nShiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow\n\nIn the parking lot with a party crowd\n\nLittle bit of love in the truck way out\n\nIf you can't get up what I'm puttin' down\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\n\n\nYeah, put the fence in the dirt, no rent paid (No rent)\n\nWhat you know about church on a Wednesday? (Uh)\n\nWhat you know about workin' me ten day straight\n\nOn a turn road, tryna get the bills paid?\n\nEver raced your truck? Ever wrecked one?\n\nSaid grace in a Mexican restaurant? (Amen)\n\nPainted \"I love you\" in bright red\n\nOn a wine tower, I bet\n\n\n\nI bet you been sittin' on a John Deere tractor\n\nBet you been fishin' with an old cane pole\n\nBeen cow-tippin' in a big green pasture\n\nBurned up a clutch on a red dirt road\n\nHomegrown twist, a pinch of tobacco\n\nShiner Friday night, the sun settin' real slow\n\nIn the parking lot with a party crowd\n\nLittle bit of love in the truck way out\n\nIf you can't get up what I'm puttin' down\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\nYou might be from a small town\n\n\n\nYou might be from a small town",
