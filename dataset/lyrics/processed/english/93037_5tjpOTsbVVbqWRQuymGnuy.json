(Where have you been)\n\nI feel so alive\n\nWith you in my bed (You in my bed)\n\nOh, darling of mine\n\nPlease don't let go (Please don't let go)\n\nJust tell me you feel this\n\nTell me you know\n\nOh, darling of mine\n\n\n\nYeah-eah\n\nYeah-eah\n\nYeah-eah\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nWhere have you been?\n\nOh, darling of mine",
