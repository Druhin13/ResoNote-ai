  "lyrics": "Someone out there loves you\r\nSomeone out there is lonely too\r\nThey may not know it, they may be trying to tell you\r\nAnd you may not know till you pass on the street\r\nYour heads turn, your eyes lock and you feel complete\r\nSomeone out there loves you\n\n\n\nWhen the world's got you down and there's no end in sight\n\nDo you give up? Keep your eyes shut?\n\nWhen the days are drawn out\n\nFeels like nothing is going your way\n\nDo you give up? Keep your eyes shut?\n\n\n\nYou can rest assured you're not the only one\n\n\n\nSomeone out there loves you\n\nSomeone out there is lonely too\n\nThey may not know it, they may be trying to tell you\n\nAnd you may not know till you pass on the street\n\nYour heads turn, your eyes lock and you feel complete\n\nSomeone out there loves you\n\n\n\nWhen the pages don't turn and the words are all blurred\n\nDon't you give up, don't you give up\n\nWhen you reach out a hand and courageously ask me to dance\n\nBut the music stops, keep your head up\n\n\n\nYou can rest assured you're not the only one\n\n\n\nSomeone out there loves you\n\nSomeone out there is lonely too\n\nThey may not know it, they may be trying to tell you\n\nAnd you may not know till you pass on the street\n\nYour heads turn, your eyes lock and you feel complete\n\nSomeone out there loves you\n\nSomeone somewhere out there loves you\n\n\n\nYou can rest assured you're not the only one\n\nYou can rest assured you're not the only one\n\nYou can rest assured you're not the only one\n\nYou can rest assured you're not the only one",
