  "lyrics": "I thought you woulda called yesterday\r\nI said I didn't want you to but I still thought you would\r\nI don't know what I expected you to say\r\nBut I turned 25 and had in my mind you'd be part of that in some way\r\nI'm halfway round the world with all these people\n\nHappy in a foreign language\n\nWhere they don't know a thing about you\n\nI'm halfway round the world in Barcelona\n\nTrying not to think you'd love this\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be about you\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be about you\n\n\n\nI wonder how I crossed your mind\n\nI'm sure I did but I'm curious what the thought of me felt like\n\nWas it harder that you imagined it would be?\n\n'Cause when I missed your 30th it almost fucking killed me\n\n\n\nI'm halfway round the world with all these people\n\nHappy in a foreign language\n\nWhere they don't know a thing about you\n\nI'm halfway round the world in Barcelona\n\nSinging songs to you for strangers\n\nAnd trying not to think about you\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be about you\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be about you\n\n\n\nI'm halfway round the world with all these people\n\nHappy in a foreign language\n\nWhere they don't know a thing about you\n\nI'm halfway round the world in Barcelona\n\nTryna feel my world expanding\n\nLike none of it was built around you\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be about you\n\nThis wasn't supposed to be about you",
