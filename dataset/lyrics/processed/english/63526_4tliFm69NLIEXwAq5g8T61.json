  "lyrics": "You with your words like knives \nand swords and the weapons \nthat you use against me\r\nYou have knocked me off my feet again\r\nGot me feelin' like a nothing\n\n\n\nYou with your voice like nails on a chalkboard\n\nCallin' me out when I'm wounded\n\n\n\nYou pickin' on the weaker man\n\nYou can take me down with just one single blow\n\nBut you don't know what you don't know\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be livin' in a big old city\n\nand all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n\nand all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\n\n\n\nYou with your switching sides \n\nand your wildfire lies and your humiliation\n\n\n\nYou have pointed out my flaws again \n\nAs if i don't already see them\n\n\n\nI walk with my head down trying to block you out\n\nCause I'll never impress you\n\n\n\nI just wanna feel ok again\n\nI'll bet you got pushed around\n\nSomebody made you cold\n\nBut the cycle ends right now\n\nCause you can't lead me down that road\n\nAnd you don't know what you don't know\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be livin' in a big old city\n\nand all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n\nand all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\n\n\n\nAnd i can see you years from now in a bar\n\nTalkin' over a football game\n\nWith that same big loud opinion \n\nBut nobody's listening\n\nWashed up and ranting about the same old bitter things\n\n\n\nDrunk and grumblin' all about how i can't sing\n\nBut all you are is mean\n\nAll you are is mean\n\nAnd a liar\n\nand pathetic\n\nand alone in life\n\n\n\nand mean (X4)\n\n\n\nBut someday I'll be livin' in a big old city\n\nand all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n\nand all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nWhy you gotta be so mean? \n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be living in a big old city \n\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\n\nAnd all you're every gonna be is mean\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nSomeday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me\n\n(Why you gotta be so mean?)\n\nAnd all you're ever gonna be is mean\n\nWhy you gotta be so mean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to PitbullsRNotMean for these lyrics)",
