  "lyrics": "I took you home to meet my family\r\nYou asked if you could stay the night\r\nHonestly I would not have minded, no\r\n'Til you gave my sister the eye\r\nWe sat for dinner 'round the table\n\nBig mumma's famous shepherd's pie (big mumma)\n\nI dropped my fork so went to find it, oh\n\nSaw your hand on my sister's thigh\n\n\n\nOh I\n\nDon't know why\n\n\n\nI thought I was your mister\n\nBut you just want my sister\n\nOh, why have you done this to me, baby?\n\nNow I know why you kissed her\n\nWhen we played family Twister\n\nOh, how awkward Christmas will be, for me\n\n\n\nAnd now you're standing at the altar\n\nYou look so beautiful in white\n\nBut it's not me who's standing with ya, no\n\nIt's that backstabbing bitch sister of mine\n\n\n\nOh I\n\nDon't know why\n\n\n\nI thought I was your mister\n\nBut you just want my sister\n\nOh, why have you done this to me, baby?\n\nNow I know why you kissed her\n\nWhen we played family Twister\n\nOh, how awkward Christmas will be, for me",
