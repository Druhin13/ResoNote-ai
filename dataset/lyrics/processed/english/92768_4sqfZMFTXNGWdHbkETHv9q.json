  "lyrics": "From here, I can hardly see a thing\r\nWe're further off with every passing second\r\nI will follow anyone that brings me to you\r\nBut the sense of time is catching up with me\r\nWill you see me, if I set fire to the sky?\n\nIf I act like I'm untouchable and golden?\n\n\n\nWonder when I'll hit the ground\n\nBeen to space but I am falling\n\nWasting what is mine\n\nFor a voice that's calling\n\n\n\nWho am I?\n\nSo many faces\n\nDressed in rags for all to see\n\nHere I am, in the mask\n\nThe Jester that wants to be free\n\n\n\nI am done\n\nWith watching graves grow mold\n\nThe sins are mine, I believe them to be\n\n\n\nAll the tears, they're draining me\n\nWe find the truth through tragedy\n\nGive me a sign, I'm on my knees\n\nFeel like you've forgotten me\n\n\n\nWho am I?\n\nSo many faces\n\nDressed in rags for all to see\n\nHere I am, in the mask\n\nThe Jester that wants to be free\n\n\n\nHow could you leave me behind?\n\nI'm tired and I felt it for sometime\n\nI can't take this much longer\n\nI'm stuck in a downward spiral\n\n(I'm stuck in a downward spiral!)\n\n(I'm stuck in a downward spiral!)\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the tears, they're draining me\n\nWe find the truth through tragedy\n\nGive me a sign, give me a sign\n\n\n\nWho am I?\n\nSo many faces\n\nDressed in rags for all to see\n\nHere I am, in the mask\n\nThe Jester that wants to be free\n\n\n\nWill you see me, if I set fire to the sky?",
