  "lyrics": "Talking we’ve been talking\r\nAnd if you only knew\r\nThis daydream I’ve been lost in\r\nLost in loving you\r\nThere’s no limit in my mind\r\nCuz what you say I’ll do\n\nJust because it’s reality, doesn’t mean it’s true\n\n\n\nBaby baby I’m not scared\n\nRunning ‘round up in my mind\n\nYou know I’m prepared\n\nThought of it a million times but\n\n\n\nI don’t know your name\n\n\n\nThinking I've been thinking\n\nOf places we could go\n\nYou me and the weekend\n\nSo let's not take it slow\n\nI'm not trying to waste your time\n\nAnd I'm no Romeo but\n\nYou need to know that I want you\n\nAnd I'm trying to let you know\n\n\n\nAction reaction we're just molecules\n\nMixing in brilliant ways\n\nIf that is true then I'm sticking with you\n\nPardon me as I'm drifting away\n\nThere's no hurry\n\nPlease don't worry\n\nThese days that ain't cool\n\nI keep waiting\n\nJust keep waiting\n\nJust keep telling myself to tell you",
