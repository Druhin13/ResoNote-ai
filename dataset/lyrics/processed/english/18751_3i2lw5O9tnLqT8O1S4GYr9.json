  "lyrics": "Just pour me a stiff drink and leave me the fuck alone\r\nMy story is missed links and riddled with undertones\r\nOf various insults in between compliments\r\nScarily impulsive and overlaid common sense\r\nScoured the universe and scorched the entire earth\r\nTo find a L'Orange beat to bring you this tired verse\n\nFrom a tired man who once was a firebrand\n\nBut once he had struck gold, he changed the entire plan\n\nNow he walks with a flask on his path\n\nTrying to figure out the math of his bills to his cash\n\nTrying to make 'em match, even better leave him\n\nWith a little scratch for his cat and his stash\n\nBut in between the laughs and the gaffes\n\nHe's a lit match, without a can full of gas\n\nAnd the fumes, they're never gonna last\n\nSo at last, he can light a cigarette and just relax\n\n\n\nDesign flaw\n\nDesign flaw\n\nDesign flaw\n\n\n\nSo how have things been going?\n\nHow the fuck do you think?\n\n\n\nHonestly pretty bad, I'm trying to get better at\n\nThinking about what they might put on my epitaph\n\nOr thinking about how I've been treating my better half\n\nOr thinking about the shit I'd be doing instead of rap\n\nI could be working at McDonald's or at the plant\n\nInstead I'm overseas, Cali to Amsterdam\n\nMoscow to D.C., Paris to Bellingham\n\nBut then the mind starts to think\n\nAnd you know, the mind it connects to the spine\n\nAnd the spine is entwined with the nerves, but I'm fine\n\nI'm inclined to the wine and I pine for a time\n\nWhen my crime was the name on the spine\n\nOf a book, never mind all the signs, how it looks\n\nIt's a crime, or at least how the law\n\nHas it defined and I'm trying to be fine\n\nBut I'm not, my design is a flaw\n\n\n\nDesign flaw\n\nDesign flaw\n\nDesign flaw",
