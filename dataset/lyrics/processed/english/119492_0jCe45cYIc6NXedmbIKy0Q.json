  "lyrics": "Hate casts a long shadow\r\nI know that I lie in it\r\nAnd let it rule my mind from time to time\r\nEscapin' an old battle\r\nThat clings on like a vine to me\r\nWhispers dirty lies in my ear\n\n\n\nI know we didn't start this fight\n\nAnd I won't let it rule my heart tonight\n\n\n\nI can change\n\nI can change\n\nI can still change\n\nI can still change\n\n\n\nTracin' an old pattern\n\nDrawing the lines from where I am and from where I wanna be\n\nForget that old adage\n\nThat history continues to keep us from a world we wanna see\n\n\n\nI am scared that I won't get it right\n\nBut fear won't rule my heart tonight\n\n\n\nI can change\n\nI can change\n\nI can still change\n\nI can still change\n\n\n\nI can change\n\nI can change\n\nI can still change\n\nI can still change\n\n\n\nI can change\n\nI can change\n\nI can still change\n\nI can still change\n\n\n\nI can change\n\nI can change\n\nI can still change\n\nI can still change",
