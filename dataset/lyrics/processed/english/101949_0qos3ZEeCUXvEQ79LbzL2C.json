  "lyrics": "The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea\r\nIt lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me\r\nAll summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand\r\nTwo sweethearts and that summer wind\r\nLike painted kites, those days and nights, they went flyin' by\n\nThe world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky\n\nThen softer than a piper man, one day it called to you\n\nWell I lost you, I lost you to that summer wind\n\n\n\nNow the autumn wind and the winter winds, they have come and gone\n\nStill the days, the lonely days go on and on\n\nAnd guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end?\n\nMy fickle friend, that summer wind\n\nOh the summer wind\n\nThe warm, warm summer wind",
