  "lyrics": "Stormy weather\r\nIn the cracks of an altered art\r\nHold my form together\r\nAs a solemn [?]\r\nI know that the marvel makes up the things that I see\r\nAnd fills me with affection\n\nBut I will lose the vision of individuality\n\nIf I go in this direction\n\n\n\nDirty fingers\n\nWashing down\n\nThe need for thinkers\n\nTo concede to clowns\n\nBut I don't feel sold\n\nFor morning's sake\n\nIt'd be more insane\n\nTo sit here mourning saints\n\n\n\nI can't think no more\n\nI can't think no more\n\n\n\nI'm no [?] conception of my reality\n\nI'm a brave mid from imperfection\n\nDoes the answer lie within me, true dualities\n\nIf there's no meaning upon reflection?\n\n\n\nI need answers\n\nI need answers\n\nI need answers\n\nI need answers, I need answers",
