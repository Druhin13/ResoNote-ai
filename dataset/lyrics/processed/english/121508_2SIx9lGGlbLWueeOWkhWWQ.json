  "lyrics": "Down on his knees he sees the devil weeping/whinging his tongue\r\nMr. Cadillac doesn't even know he's been fighting his own\r\nHe's been trying shooting all the angels/devils inside\r\nPlaying around with the good and the evil in his mind\r\nAlone in the desert and cold so cold\n\nDriving back to the 10 house city something is wrong\n\nHe found the killer weapon in his car on the floor\n\nDelusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave\n\nFeeding monsters in the back of his head\n\nKiller, ripper, who are you\n\nTake a look into the mirror then you will know\n\nHeaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better\n\n\n\nWelcome to a world of chaos, you been caught in the light\n\nSaw the door to the 10 house tale 7 shots in the night\n\n\n\nStanding in the dark and shaking my own hand for a while\n\nSaw the angel/devil vanished out in the light\n\nBreathing new air for a day to begin\n\nSoulless body with an empty shell\n\nKiller, ripper, who are you\n\nTake a look into the mirror then you will know\n\nHeaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better\n\n\n\nThe price was high to pay and the memories are all crying like a child\n\nA reason for all the blood that leaked, and a call up for the wild\n\nFollow me to relentless street where all pain and love will die\n\n7 shots in the body fakes well the loaded mind",
