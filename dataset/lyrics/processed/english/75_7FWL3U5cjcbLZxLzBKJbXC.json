  "lyrics": "Turn back the pages in the rays of the sun\r\nThrow back Thursday to the way that it was\r\nWhen we were young, when we were young\r\nScroll back in time through your account\r\nWatch your face grow younger as real time runs out\n\nThrow back Thursday to the way that it was\n\nWhen we were young, when we were young\n\n\n\nOh, all the potential in the world\n\nWhen we were young\n\nAll the potential in the world\n\nWhen we were young, when we were young\n\n\n\nStop me if you've heard this one before\n\nYou know you caught my eye as I was headed out the door\n\nI swear I know your face from another time, another place\n\nWhen we were young, when we were young\n\n\n\nOh, all the potential in the world\n\nWhen we were young\n\nAll the potential in the world\n\nWhen we were young, when we were young\n\n\n\n\n\nWho knows how much time we ever really have?\n\nTogether in this life or on our separate paths\n\nWe go through so many days, so many lives, so many ways\n\nWe fall apart, we come together, so in love\n\nYeah, to be loved, to be loved, loved\n\n\n\nOh, all the potential in the world\n\nWhen we were young\n\nAll the potential in the world\n\nStill living now, living now\n\nNow",
