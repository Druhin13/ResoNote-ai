  "lyrics": "Like an island rain\r\nThat comes in out of nowhere\r\nMight not chose to go there\r\nBut it hits you just the same\r\nClose your eyes and see what matters\r\nWash away worry and pain\n\nThere's holy water in an island rain\n\n\n\nMaybe what you have ain't what you wanted\n\nWhere you are ain't where you wanna be\n\nMaybe you feel tied down\n\nMaybe somethin's gonna come around\n\nTo set you free\n\n\n\nLike an island rain\n\nThat comes in out of nowhere\n\nMight not chose to go there\n\nBut it hits you just the same\n\nClose your eyes and see what matters\n\nWash away worry and pain\n\nThere's holy water in an island rain\n\n\n\nEveryday is a blessing to be counted\n\nEvery night is a lesson to be learned\n\nWatching the world go 'round\n\nTakes a whole lot of up and down\n\nTo make it turn\n\n\n\nLike an island rain\n\nThat comes in out of nowhere\n\nMight not chose to go there\n\nBut it hits you just the same\n\nClose your eyes and see what matters\n\nWash away worry and pain\n\nThere's holy water in an island rain\n\nIn an island rain\n\nIn an island rain",
