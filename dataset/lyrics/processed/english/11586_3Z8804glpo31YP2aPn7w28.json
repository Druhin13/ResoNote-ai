  "lyrics": "I don’t think I can remember in my entire life another time just like this\r\nNever did it before, never been so unsure, this is a special moment\r\nI don’t know what to do whenever something is new I always seem to forget\r\nI can’t make sense of the way, the words that I want to say, and lose them all in my head\r\nReady, or not, but here I come\n\nLured me right out of where I’m from\n\nI'll look around and wait to see\n\nWhatever works its way to be\n\n\n\nI don’t think that I could ever be prepared to discover something perfectly new\n\nBut the desire to know makes it curious, so I guess I’m kind of amused\n\nAnd it’s just the thought that maybe understanding so vaguely is the way it should be\n\nIf it’s a mystery still and always has that appeal, perhaps that’s better, really\n\n\n\nReady, or not, but here I come\n\nLured me right out of where I’m from\n\nI'll look around and wait to see\n\nWhatever works its way to be\n\n\n\nI don’t think I can remember in my entire life another time just like this\n\nDon’t understand what I feel, can’t pick out if it is real, this is a special moment",
