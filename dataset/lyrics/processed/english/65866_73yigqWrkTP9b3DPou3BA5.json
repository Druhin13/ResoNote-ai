  "lyrics": "They don't want me any more, They all say I'm through Well it's time they knew... With on look I can break your heart With one look I play every part I can make your sad heart sing With one look you'll know All you need to know. With one smile I'm the girl next door Or the love that you've hungered for When I speak it's with my soul I can play any role No words can tell The stories my eyes tell Watch me when I frown You can't write that down You kno wI'm right It's there in black and white When I look your way You'll hear what I say. Yes, with one look I put words to shame Just one look Sets the screen aflame Silent music starts to play One tear from my eye Makes the whole world cry. With one look They'll forgive the past They'll rejoice: I've returned at last To my people in the dark Still out there in the dark... Silent music starts to play With one look you'll know All you need to know. With one look I'll ignite a blaze I'll return to my glory days They'll say Norma's back at last. This time I'm staying I'm staying for good I'll be back Where I was born to be With one look I'll be me...",
