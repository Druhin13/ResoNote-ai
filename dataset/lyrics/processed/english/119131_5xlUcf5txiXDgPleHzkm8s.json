  "lyrics": "I've made mistakes, the Lord struck me down\r\nCaught in a landslide, lost underground\r\nI hear them gates, swing open wide\r\nCome close to midnight, hell sent me down\r\nAnd then my eyes got used to the darkness\n\nAnd everyone that I knew\n\nWas lost and so long forgotten after you\n\n\n\nNow would you break before you twist the knife?\n\nYeah, would you take my hand and take a life?\n\nI'm too damn young to give up on the light\n\nI'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness\n\nI'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone\n\nI can't bring it back on everything I've done\n\nAnd now there's no-one else left to love\n\nI'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness\n\n\n\nSweet smell of roses, have come at last\n\nOne fist of Earth fights, to come join the rest\n\n\n\nAnd then my eyes got used to the darkness\n\nAnd everyone that I knew\n\nWas lost and so long forgotten after you\n\n\n\nNow would you break before you twist the knife?\n\nYeah, would you take my hand and take a life?\n\nI'm too damn young to give up on the light\n\nI'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness\n\nI'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone\n\nI can't bring it back on everything I've done\n\nAnd now there's no-one else left to love\n\nI'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness\n\n\n\nI got used to the darkness too\n\nI got used to the darkness for you\n\nI got used to the darkness too\n\nYes I did\n\n\n\nWould you break before you twist the knife?\n\nWould you take my hand and take a life?\n\nI'm too damn young to give up on the light\n\nI'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness\n\nI'm just a man, I'm only flesh and bone\n\nI can't bring it back on everything I've done\n\nAnd now there's no-one else left to love\n\nI'm used to the darkness, I'm used to the darkness",
