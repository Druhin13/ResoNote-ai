To be honest, I don’t know\n\nBut I believe in Ghosts and I believe in Lambo’s\n\n\n\nI was made for this shit, rookie of the year\n\nI wouldn’t show up for the freshman list\n\nYour swag expired, you ain’t fresh like this\n\nShit on all my haters, I’ma make them pissed\n\nI was made for this shit, rookie of the year\n\nI wouldn’t show up for the freshman list\n\nYour swag expired, you ain’t fresh like this\n\nShit on all my haters, I’ma make them pissed",
