  "lyrics": "Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh...\r\nAt seventeen, I started to starve myself\r\nI thought that love was a kind of emptiness\r\nAnd at least I understood then the hunger I felt\r\nAnd I didn't have to call it loneliness\n\n\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\n\n\nTell me what you need, oh, you look so free\n\nThe way you use your body, baby, come on and work it for me\n\nDon't let it get you down, you're the best thing I've seen\n\nWe never found the answer but we knew one thing\n\n\n\nWe all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)\n\nWe all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)\n\nWe all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)\n\nWe all have a hunger (We all have a hunger)\n\n\n\nAnd it's Friday night and it's kicking in\n\nAnd I can't dress, they're gonna crucify me\n\nOh, but you and all your vibrant youth\n\nHow could anything bad ever happen to you?\n\nYou make a fool of death with your beauty, and for a moment\n\n\n\nI thought that love was in the drugs\n\nBut the more I took, the more it took away\n\nAnd I could never get enough\n\nI thought that love was on the stage\n\nYou give yourself to strangers\n\nYou don't have to be afraid\n\nAnd then it tries to find a home with people, oh, and I'm alone\n\nPicking it apart... and staring at your phone\n\n\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\n\n\nTell me what you need, oh, you look so free\n\nThe way you use your body, baby, come on and work it for me\n\nDon't let it get you down, you're the best thing I've seen\n\nWe never found the answer but we knew one thing\n\n\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\n(We all have a hunger)\n\nWe all have a hunger \n\n(We all have a hunger)\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\n(We all have a hunger)\n\nWe all have a hunger\n\n(We all have a hunger)\n\n\n\nAnd it's Friday night and it's kicking in\n\nAnd I can't dress, they're gonna crucify me\n\nOh, you and all your vibrant youth\n\nHow could anything bad ever happen to you?\n\nYou make a fool of death with your beauty, and for a moment\n\nI forget to worry",
