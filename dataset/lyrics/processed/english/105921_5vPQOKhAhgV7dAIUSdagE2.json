  "lyrics": "They turn the lights down low\r\nIn shadows hiding from the world\r\nOnly coming out when it gets cold\r\nThe seas part when they hit the floor\r\nVoices carry on and out the door\r\nEverything you touch turns into gold\n\n\n\nLike the angel you are\n\nYour laugh creating a lightness in my chest\n\nYour eyes they penetrate me\n\n(your answer's always 'maybe')\n\nThat's when I got up and left\n\n\n\nA beating heart and a microphone\n\nA ticking clock in an empty home still tells\n\nOf these times so long ago\n\nAnd even though I've come so far\n\nI know I've got so far to go\n\nAnd any day now I'll explode\n\n\n\nLike the angel you are\n\nYour laugh creating a lightness in my chest\n\nYour eyes they penetrate me\n\n(your answer's always 'maybe')\n\nThat's when I got up and left\n\n\n\nAnd each and every day will lead into tomorrow\n\nAnd tomorrow brings one less day without you\n\nBut don't wait up just leave the light on\n\nCause all the roads that I might take\n\nWill all one day lead back to you\n\n\n\nAnd like the angel you are\n\nYour laugh creating a lightness in my chest\n\nYour eyes they penetrate me\n\n(Never cease to amaze me)\n\nThat's when I got up and left",
