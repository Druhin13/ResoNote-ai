Do you trust yourself?\n\nAnytime you walk out the door\n\nIt's a bag full of ones and lame nigga under your belt\n\nBut I won't judge\n\nI won't judge, don't judge yourself\n\nPromise I'm not here to burden you\n\nI'm here to help (Na, for real)\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for someone to change you life, change your life\n\nI can be the one who can change your life\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\n\nBaby, I can be the one that can change your life\n\nAnd I know that you're young and you're filled with life\n\nAin't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\n\nAin't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes\n\n\n\nShe don't want love\n\nShe don't love no one but herself\n\nOnly thing she cares about is a lace-front weave\n\nAnd the boutiques from Chanel\n\nShe don't want love\n\nShe don't want love from no one else\n\nShe don't love no one but herself\n\n\n\nI wanna amuse you, oh, let me use you\n\nAll for the good, not for the bad, I won't abuse you\n\nWon't say I need you, too scared to lose you\n\nPut down your pride, see through your eyes, somebody bruised you\n\nKnow what you been through, I wan' avenge you\n\nAct like you mad, act like you sad yet, but yet, pretend to\n\nSay you love honesty, but yet, it offends you\n\nJust hit my line, I got some lovin' I could lend you\n\n\n\nIf you're looking for someone to change you life, change your life\n\nI can be the one who can change your life\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\n\nBaby, I can be the one that can change your life\n\nAnd I know that you're young and you're filled with life\n\nAin't no need to be ashamed, I don't judge nor bite\n\nIf you're looking for someone who can change your life\n\nAin't no need to cry, baby, wipe your eyes\n\n\n\nShe don't want love\n\nShe don't love no one but herself\n\nAll she really cares about is a lace-front weave\n\nAnd a bag that's from Chanel\n\nShe don't want love\n\nShe don't want love from no one else\n\nShe don't want love\n\nAll she love is herself",
