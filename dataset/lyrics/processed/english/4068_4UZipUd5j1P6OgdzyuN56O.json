  "lyrics": "Nomads plunging into the vast abyss\r\nUnattached, fleeting through the chasm\r\nNaked in pure darkness\r\nEmbracing the new dawn\r\nWe are gods here for the taking\n\nYield to the dragon's embrace\n\nWe are godsÂ \n\nYield to the dragon's embrace\n\n\n\nAs pawns in this secret game\n\nNo one knows nothing\n\nYet, in the realm of sacred play\n\nEveryone knows everything\n\n\n\nA winged and secret flame\n\nLeaving this paradigm\n\nA dimension we are set to flee\n\n\n\nWe are gods in the making\n\nWe are here for the taking\n\nYield to the dragon's embrace\n\nWe are of transcendence\n\nWe are wolves and snakes\n\n\n\nA winged and secret flame\n\nLeaving this paradigm\n\nA dimension we are set to flee\n\nThe arrival is in the departure\n\nWe are sculpted into life\n\nBy the hands of death",
