  "lyrics": "Speak and reveal to me the depths you’re hiding in so I can be with you\r\nAll the noise is gone, feel it all go quiet now\r\nSpeak and reveal to me the depths you’re hiding in so I can be with you\r\nAll the noise is gone, feel it all go quiet now\r\nIt suddenly explodes every nerve at once\n\nIt suddenly explodes\n\n\n\nI’m an empty promise just passing off the blame\n\nYour eyes wander through my faces\n\nIt’s no wonder it all feels the same\n\nYour eyes wander through my faces\n\n\n\nCrashed in swirling heat, I’d hate see blow out in front of me\n\nFragment light displays; our mirrored hearts collapse and crash\n\n\n\nIn the years before I know you let her go\n\nLoosely fading ghosts to take her place\n\nDust to settle in, I wait to feel alone\n\nIn the years before I know you let her go\n\n\n\nPainted in ash all the words that you said as you walked away\n\nLoosely fading ghosts to take our place\n\nIf I could suspend time all together\n\nWould you stay up here forever?\n\n\n\nI’m an empty promise just passing off the blame\n\nYour eyes wander through my faces\n\nIt’s no wonder it all feels the same\n\nYour eyes wander through my faces\n\n\n\nBlack out throne towers over me\n\nSubstance control bleeds in and out\n\nShe’ll be laughing at me later\n\nBut the question stays for now unanswered\n\n\n\nIs it always the same with me, I don’t remember my nights\n\nIs it always the same damn thing, I don’t remember my nights",
