  "lyrics": "You tell me, you've started, praying all the time and you keep me on your mind\r\nWhen traffic is slow and the dead rain hits the window\r\nI am sorry to say, it is taking time just to get it right\r\nIt is easy to see, when my walls are up, I can know no luck\r\nWon't you wait? Baby, won't you wait?\n\n\n\nYou tell me, you've started, searching for a meaning in words that I've been speaking\n\nAnd barely getting through, there is still so much I wanna say to you\n\nYou show me, I could be poison free, and I now believe in the beauty of a thorn\n\nSinking in as the blood is drawn\n\n\n\nWon't you wait? Baby, won't you wait?\n\n\n\nI'm over the hillside like every day\n\nHow many times can I say?\n\nI promise tomorrow I'm turning the page\n\nI see why you started to pray\n\n\n\nWait, wait, wait, wait\n\nBaby, won't you wait?",
