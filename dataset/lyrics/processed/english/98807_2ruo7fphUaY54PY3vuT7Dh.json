  "lyrics": "Two times in one night\r\nTwo nights in a row\r\nIt's fine; I'm alright\r\nI'll never let it go\r\nIt's cool, it's just getting old\n\nIt was never personal\n\nTwo times in one night\n\nTwo nights in a row\n\n\n\nAnd I have no idea\n\nWhat you're going through\n\nSo I won't act like I do\n\n\n\nSilence in between the songs\n\nCatches everyone off guard\n\nIf it's a little too bare right now\n\nYou can look forward to showing off the scars\n\n\n\nThe way you hold it in\n\nCarves your face out like a shell\n\nTwo times in the same night\n\nI'll probably never tell\n\n\n\n'Cause I have no idea\n\nWhat you're going through\n\nSo I won't act like I do\n\n\n\nI would sleep better on your floor\n\nThan I would ever in my bed\n\nAnd if your carpet makes my face itch\n\nItâ€™d still be heaven in my head\n\n\n\nI would stop doing all those things\n\nThe doctor tells me not to do\n\nBut I don't think he understands\n\nI do all of these things for you\n\nFor you, for you\n\nLike I do",
