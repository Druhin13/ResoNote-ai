  "lyrics": "To a world we'll not remember\r\nWhen we're old and tired\r\nWe'll be blowing on the embers of a little fire\r\nWe were the tallest person watching in Chesapeake\r\nYou put me on your shoulders so I could see\n\nI was all covered in sound\n\nEar plugs so it wasn't loud\n\nSwallowed up by the crowd\n\nDidn't know what they were singing about\n\nI can't hardly wait\n\nFor someone to replace\n\n\n\nIt was hot in the arena\n\nGood men die like dogs\n\nMy hero plays to no one, in a parking lot\n\nEven though there's no one around\n\nHe broke a leg and the house came down\n\nA smattering of applause\n\nA sliver moon and a cover song\n\n\n\nOh sweet child of mine\n\nYou're always sorry for everything, never apologize\n\nOh sweet child of mine\n\nNow you stand on the corner and hope you get recognized\n\n\n\nI was all covered in sound\n\nWhen you asked me to turn it down\n\nDidn't even think it was loud\n\nCan you hear it now?",
