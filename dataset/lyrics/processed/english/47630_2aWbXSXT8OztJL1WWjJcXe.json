  "lyrics": "The size of sin is as small as a grain of\r\nsand\r\nBut separates between wide ocean and\r\ndry land\r\nIt's bigger than bad habits\r\nIt's a matter of man seeking for Gods\n\nspot following in the same pattern as\n\nAdam\n\nIt's deep rooted, were the seed of our\n\nbroken family tree\n\nBranching out limbs of disease, look at\n\nthis mess we leave\n\nThis weight of wickedness is heavy as\n\nlead\n\nTrying to catch its descent's like stopping\n\na falling rock in a spiders web\n\nIt's thin silk thread begins to snap\n\nAnd all that's left is the residue that\n\nsticks between the cracks\n\nIt all ends with a slip, into a bottomless\n\npit\n\nGrips the heart in a mans chest, til\n\nswallowing death\n\nSipping from the glass of Gods wrath and\n\ngenuine justice\n\nA just judge must summons for infinite\n\npunishment\n\nAnd when he applying were undeniably\n\nliable\n\nThe smallest white lie is enough to be\n\nindictable\n\nThe size of sin so big it causes a cosmic\n\nfraction\n\nAnd hell is the only relevant response to\n\nrighteous reaction\n\nThis is what our sinful actions actually\n\nearned us\n\nBut God took upon himself the weight of\n\nsin reserved for us\n\nA weight so significant\n\nThat only the blood of an innocent one is\n\nacceptable and worthy\n\nSo rather than make light of it, or\n\nminimize the size of it\n\nWe should marvel at the magnitude of\n\nmercy\n\n\n\n(Thanks to watwego daniel for these lyrics)",
