  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Mural Jr. par Lupe Fiasco\r\nHoly assumption of man into the heaven's sphere\nMany mansions fit champions within its seven tiers\nEvangelists re-imagine every 11 years\nPause for applause, evolves to what was never here\nBorn to death, born to die\nForm the flesh, form the eyes\nA veritable storm of winged forms swarms the skies\nMarital norms unperformed but the porn survives\nIn the dorms of the scorn, they keep warm supplies\nGone to lose the use of tooth, horn and thigh\nFarthest standing, I was landing\nTwo one hand, one man bands jamming in tandem\n\nHe who power naps, then plans gathering ransoms\nAnd maps man's laps in a hand lathered in absinthe\nGotta talent traffic and ramblings\nAnd handing out amazing handmade maps of the labyrinth\nOut the back of the wagon\nOut the back of the madam\nOut the back of the Magnum\nThen out the trap of enchantment\nBellerophon with a megaphone, megaman\nDesert zone run marathons with sweaters on (sweaters on)\nThat was so simple but hot in a place where it's so simple but not\nClosed temples and ole little forgots and rode whole chissles\nCripples with raw missles a lot\n\nThe old hoes that they won't give you a shot\nBut you can get the whole pistol, it's gon' hit you a lot\nThese are real words from a savage mind\nUnmaximized man on an average climb\nWho don't deserve the whole truth and only half your time\nFit the life of a whole booth in only half a line\nIn the future life, I don't even have to rhyme\nWe'll get the entire Armageddon with only half the signs\nJust yields and rail roads\nIn lush fields with bell tolls\nCouple huddles of the unskilled but well told\nIt's unreal how off one deal to sell souls\nAnd he got em' by the dozen\nMedulla oblongata is what got them by the oven\nLike how the moonshine is what got him by the cousin\n\nHe gotta buy the bottom and he 'bout to stick his tongue in\nSuch an unsettling scene\nAn obscene setting for the unwedding of rings\nThe sharpest dresser at the unheading of queens\nThe architecture is something you've never seen\nDream clean\nThat's three words at the same time\nThey killed three bird with the same\nAnd one each in every hand with the same bluffing\nAnswers each and every man with the same question\nWhat is it?\nBut you still wanna know but I already done did it\nI ball heavy, the physics, it's all\nBut it's already specific\nIf we doing what's already done, that means it's already terrific\n\nThat's rather meta-poetic, and just to acknowledge that\nAs an extra exhibit to what's already within it\nThe gallery's like the wall space\nSo I made a gallery of galleries made of all space\nIf it was more small, it would be Moore's Law\nFrom the land of the po' where we war Saw\nFrom the hand of a pro to whore jaw\nMake a stand to the store till the snow thaw\nWent from paper boy to editor\nFrom throwing Ars Poetica with the arms of Federer\nOn the porches and steps to the farm houses of settlers\nOne of several sects who can come and charm the predators\nWe who measure the measuring tools of measurers\n\nWe who pleasure the pleasure tubes of pleasurers\nWe who lecture at treasured schools of lecturers\nWe who question the cherished rules of leveragers\nBorn to death, born to die\nMourn correct immortalized\nIn a war, where your performance score is your salary\nIt's like fantasies combatting your mortality\nI'm just trying to restore sanities\nSigmund Freud boy, Leroy to your vanity\nTo instill what kills krill destroys manitee\nSo heels spill but still seal deals that build factories\nWhat looks Roman senator inner reveals macabees\nNever just trust off guts, but what's actually\nUnless it's quatos\nNow, we back to pillars of salt\nI recall back peeling potatoes\n\nIn hindsight, maybe a tank of killer tomatoes\nA seasoned shoulder's carrying plenty pintos in payloads\nNow, that's another strata but I was making sense\nThen cop out, took the highway and I was making chips\nA nappy-head Karate Kid, I was breaking bricks\nCan fight like Tekken 5, even taking 6\nThis rehabilitation, I be taking trips\n\"Don't Ruin Us\" God said, I won't make a dent\nHardly, but I'm still Harvey\nI hope this making sense\nDevil tooting his own horn, don't come and take a sniff\nIn the streets you gotta fight, you get punished for taking whiffs\nTo make that change for your team, you gotta have New Jersey driving\n\nA stomach for taking whips\nI'm just trying to redeem\nWith these hands full of bars, don't beat me for coming clean\nTo unify the hooks\nIf you know it, then come and sing\nDon't bust in while I'm sleep\nNightmares becoming dreams\nSamurais rarely die from another sword\nThis is 1985 meets the hover board\nThat was Bobby Johnson potato, just the underscore\nThink deep, but don't let it fry your motherboards\nDip teeth, so now the painting's plural\nBut this is Jr's Mural",
