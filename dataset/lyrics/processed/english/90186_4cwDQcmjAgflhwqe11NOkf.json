  "lyrics": "Are those marks on your skin?\r\nStill reminds me of where you've been\r\nIf you're going out or staying in\r\nEither way I, I want in\r\nYou're the closest thing that happened\r\nThat I ever knew\n\nBaby, I don't want no lovers\n\nI got it with you\n\n\n\nYou said, \"What?\" too many times\n\nSo proud of when it hurt you\n\nTake your time when meeting somebody new\n\nI never judge you, I wanna love you right oh\n\n\n\nI can't make your past go away\n\nBut I'll make you forget it\n\n(I can't make your past go away but I'll make you forget)\n\nI can't make your past go away\n\nBut I'll make you forget it\n\n(I can't make your past go away but I'll make you forget)\n\n\n\nRight when we met\n\nIt was like a reflex\n\nI could be a shy guy\n\nSuicide on my mind\n\nI've been thinking about how I've changed\n\nEver since I saw your face\n\nJust somebody who wanna mess you up\n\nBut he's lucky I'll miss you later\n\nYou've been quicker then we are used to\n\nI see right through you\n\nYour eyes in the dark like lights\n\nBright my life, and I hope I do you\n\nAnd I hope this voodoo\n\nThe way that I move you\n\nLike you move me\n\nCome on too, I'll be your groupie, I swear\n\n\n\nYou said, \"What?\" too many times\n\nSo proud of when it hurt you\n\nTake your time when meeting somebody new\n\nI never judge you, I wanna love you right oh\n\n\n\nI can't make your past go away\n\nBut I'll make you forget it\n\nI can't make your past go away\n\nBut I'll make you forget it",
