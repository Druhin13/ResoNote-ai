  "lyrics": "You fight like hell but you’re barely alive\r\nWork so hard just trying to survive\r\nHead’s under water and your hands are tied, I know\r\nDream so big eyes are wide\r\nThat’s the kinda life that I can’t provide\r\nIt breaks my heart how you feel tonight, I know\n\n\n\nLean into me with your back and your mind\n\nLean into me when you’re broken inside\n\n\n\nOoh lay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down on me\n\nOoh lay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down on me\n\nOn the run but we’re never there\n\nTake no time coming up for air\n\nThere’s a deeper feeling that this life’s not fair, I know\n\nDream so big and feel so small\n\nFight while you’re sinking like a cannonball\n\nWonder if it makes any difference at all, I know\n\n\n\nLean into me with your back and your mind\n\nLean into me no reason to hide\n\n\n\nOoh lay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down on me\n\nOoh lay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down\n\nLay your worry down on me\n\n\n\nLean into me\n\nWhen the light can’t be found\n\nWhen everything’s lost\n\nAnd your heart’s on the ground\n\nLean into me lay it all down",
