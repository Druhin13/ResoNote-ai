  "lyrics": "(Bob Welch)\r\nYou are here and warm,\r\nBut I could look away and you'd be gone.\r\n'Cause we live in a time,\r\nWhen meaning falls in splinters from our minds.\n\nAnd that's why I've travelled far,\n\n'Cause I come so together where you are.\n\nAnd all of the things that I said that I wanted\n\nCome rushing by in my head when I'm with you\n\nFourteen joys and a will to be married\n\nAll of the things that you say are very...\n\nSentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,\n\nSentimental lady, gentle one.\n\nSentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,\n\nSentimental lady, gentle one.\n\nNow you are here today,\n\nBut easily you might just slip away.\n\n'Cause we live in a time,\n\nWhen paintings have no color, words don't rhyme.\n\nAnd that's why I've travelled far\n\n'Cause I come so together where you are.\n\nAnd all of the things that I said that I wanted\n\nCome rushing by in my head when I'm with you\n\nFourteen joys and a will to be married\n\nAll of the things that you say are very...\n\nSentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,\n\nSentimental lady, gentle one.\n\nSentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,\n\nSentimental lady, gentle one.\n\nYou are here and warm,\n\nBut I could look away and you'd be gone.\n\n'Cause we live in a time,\n\nWhen meaning falls in splinters from our lives.\n\nAnd that's why I've travelled far,\n\n'Cause I come so together where you are.\n\nYes, and all of the things that I said that I wanted\n\nCome rushing by in my head when I'm with you\n\nFourteen joys and a will to be married\n\nAll of the things that you say are very...\n\nSentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,\n\nSentimental lady, gentle one.\n\nSentimental gentle wind, blowin' through my life again,\n\nSentimental lady, gentle one.",
