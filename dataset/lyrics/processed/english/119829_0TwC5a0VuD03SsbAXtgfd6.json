  "lyrics": "I'm in my 20s\r\nSo I panic in every way\r\nI'm so scared of the future\r\nI keep missing today\r\nHow did you do it?\r\nHow did it turn out alright?\n\nI swear it's always easier back then\n\nOr is it just hindsight?\n\n\n\nThey keep telling me\n\n\"You've got your whole life ahead of you, baby\n\nDon't worry, don't stress, do your best\"\n\nWhat if that doesn't save me?\n\nThey say \"If I could go back and do it again\n\nI would've wasted all my money\n\nWould've slept with all my friends\" but you didn't\n\n'Cause you had your whole life ahead of you, baby\n\n\n\nI don't dare shut my eyes\n\nI don't wanna miss a thing\n\nI don't wanna let you down\n\nI don't wanna disappoint me\n\nI won't stop looking at others\n\nThinking that's where I should be\n\nI'm trying to enjoy myself, love myself\n\nWho the fuck is myself?\n\n\n\nBut they keep telling me\n\n\"You've got your whole life ahead of you, baby\n\nDon't worry, don't stress, do your best\"\n\nWhat if that doesn't save me?\n\nThey say \"If I could go back, if I was still young\n\nI would've cared less, made more mistakes to learn from\"\n\nBut you didn't 'cause you had your whole life ahead of you, baby\n\n\n\nHow did you make it work out? Don't tell me you faked it\n\nShould I be changing it now or am I too late?\n\nCould just be me or maybe our generation\n\nStill they say \"Be patient, it's all meant to be\n\nYou've got your whole life ahead of you, baby\n\nYou've got your whole life ahead of you, baby\"\n\n\n\nThey say \"If I could go back and do it again\n\nI would've wasted all my money\n\nWould've slept with all my friends\" but you didn't\n\n'Cause you had your whole life ahead of you, baby\n\n\n\nThey say \"If I could go back and do it again, do it again...\"\n\nThey say \"If I could go back and do it again...\"",
