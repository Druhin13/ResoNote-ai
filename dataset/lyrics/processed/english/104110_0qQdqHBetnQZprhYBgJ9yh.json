  "lyrics": "My mama called me up because there's fire on the streets\r\nOf all the Berkeley Police\r\nAnd they're all slobs doing stupid jobs\r\nAnd we're having indigestion in the belly of the beast\r\nBecause we're slobs doing stupid jobs\n\nAnd you put your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nBail out your guilty ass\n\nIt's not your business uh\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nBail your guilty ass out\n\n\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nYour TV lies\n\nWe'll be alright\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nI'm still alive\n\nI don't know why\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\n\n\nThere's plenty different versions\n\nOn and off your TV screen\n\nOf us annoyed\n\nThe property destroyed\n\nBecause TV news is bad for you\n\nAnd bad TV is news for you\n\nIt's just a ploy, keep you under control\n\nToo many, too many motherfuckers\n\nConfusing this freedom speech with swastikas\n\n\n\nLike Milo Yiannopolous\n\n\n\nOkay, so we broke a little window\n\nLittle fight out in the street\n\nBut that's our job\n\nProtect you from these slobs\n\n\n\nAnd you put your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nBail out your guilty ass\n\nIt's not your business uh\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nBail your guilty ass out\n\n\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nYour TV lies\n\nWe'll be alright\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nI'm still alive\n\nI don't know why\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\n\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\n\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nYour TV lies\n\nWe'll be alright\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\nI'm still alive\n\nI don't know why\n\nBerkeley's on fire\n\n\n\nYou better put your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms down\n\nYou didn't wish it, go\n\nPut your pom-poms back down",
