Woo! Keep my sword on me like Conan\n\nBefore the rap, I swear I was poor man\n\nNow my cribs and shit gotta door man\n\nNiggas stay hating like \"Herbo a ho man\"\n\n\"How yo gon' show man? Whatchu gon' blow, then?\"\n\n\"I heard he toting his pipe everyday and he shot some before\"\n\n\"What, you knew him before then?\"\n\nI heard he the realest, and he be with killers\n\nThey sound like gorillas, and ride 4 wheelers\n\nThey waving them 30s and yellin' \"No Limit!\"\n\nIf you ain't with it then bitch mind your business\n\nGot bulletproof vests, just like armadillos\n\nI'm on the corner, with nothin' but dealers\n\nClinching a .40 when I'm on the block\n\nWater whippin' my wrist when I'm under the ceiling\n\nGuess I'm a hypocrite, 'fore I got shot\n\nWe was sending 'em out, give a fuck 'bout they feelings\n\nAnd when I got shot, I was back on the block\n\nWith my crutch and my Glock, give a fuck 'bout the healing\n\nFrom the start of the day to the finish we was drillin'\n\nGuess we was mentally illing\n\nCouldn't even stop, we allergic to chillin'\n\nHad to wake up and think like a villain (han)\n\nNow my whole thought process different\n\nWake up and think bout a million\n\nSometimes I don't talk I just listen\n\nCan't never be nothin' I ain't missin'\n\nSome shit you just learn on your own\n\nI taught myself how to not go to prison\n\nThey want us to be all alone\n\nThey tryin' divide us off in divisions\n\nTryin' divide us by our decisions\n\nTake advantage of our kindness so that's why I'm vicious\n\nI seen ballers rise and fall that's why I'm ambitious\n\nLocked in shackles or they gone, most of all my niggas\n\nPour out all my liquor",
