  "lyrics": "There's a silencing\r\nAs the machine arrives here\r\nI feel it pulling me\r\nI feel the past that's died here\r\nI hear it calling me\r\n\"You can come alive here.\"\n\nI hear it beckoning\n\nUntil I am inside\n\n\n\nRiding the horizon\n\nFalling into you\n\nFeel the vessel tighten\n\nI feel you pull me through\n\nA new world is breaking\n\nYour heart is unveiling\n\nBreaking into pieces\n\nIn the gravity of you\n\n\n\nI see the empty dreams\n\nRace across the sky here\n\nI see energy streams\n\nWhere the ashes lie here\n\nI feel you here with me\n\nWhen all the hope has died here\n\nIt's boring holes in me\n\nEnough to get inside\n\n\n\nRiding the horizon\n\nFalling into you\n\nFeel the vessel tighten\n\nI feel you pull me through\n\nA new world is breaking\n\nYour heart is unveiling\n\nBreaking into pieces\n\nIn the gravity of you\n\nIn the gravity of you\n\n\n\nTo fall in the star is to be nothingness\n\nTo escape is to be empty\n\nFall into the star and then we won't exist\n\nOr escape into the nothing\n\n\n\nTo fall in the star is to be nothingness\n\nTo escape is to be empty\n\nFall into the star and then we won't exist\n\nOr escape into the nothing\n\n\n\nYour sky\n\nThe beauty alone is worth it\n\nI will risk it all to own it\n\n\n\nRiding the horizon\n\nFalling into you\n\nFeel the vessel tighten\n\nI feel you pull me through\n\nA new world is breaking\n\nYour heart is unveiling\n\nBreaking into pieces\n\nIn the gravity of you\n\nIn the gravity of you",
