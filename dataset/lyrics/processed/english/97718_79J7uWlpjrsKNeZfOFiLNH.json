Yeah\n\nI don’t believe in myself\n\nSo I’ll just keep to myself\n\nIf I get to the top, then I’m gonna reach it myself\n\nAnd it’s gone be easy to tell, I’ll see it myself\n\n\n\nI\n\nThe reason that they never gone cry\n\nThe reason that they never know why\n\nI’m the only thing that’s in my mind\n\nI just\n\nI just pulled up in the building\n\nThey all faking, I’m the motherfucking real thing\n\nThey all hating, I’m the motherfucking real one\n\nI used to think I was a fraud until I did some\n\nUntil I mufuckin did it...\n\n\n\nLast week I panicked, huh yeah\n\nKnowing I got all these people to please been driving me manic uh yeah\n\nI used to roast fousey, nowadays I understand it\n\nI wanna be the reason that they leave they feet up in a mansion\n\nI need expansion\n\nI took my dream it ain’t handed\n\nTurned that shit straight to a cannon\n\nFuck all that planning, I never planned it\n\nOut of this world in a whole other planet\n\nEverything candid\n\nMy career belong in whole foods, this shit is organic bitch\n\nI’m the real thing ain’t no camera tricks\n\nWhen I used to call, they ain’t answer this\n\nNow I’m really on the top but feeling like I’m at bottom so you know I’m gonna make it through the damages, yuh\n\nI know that I’ve sacrificed my time with friends and family\n\nThinking maybe when I get success then they all gonna stand with me\n\nBut this ain’t a flip of a switch it’s all happening gradually\n\nMaybe I’m selfish, I do it all so that they gone be proud of me\n\n\n\nI\n\nThe reason that they never gone cry\n\nThe reason that they never know why\n\nI’m the only thing that’s in my mind\n\nI just\n\nI just pulled up in the building\n\nThey all faking, I’m the motherfucking real thing\n\nThey all hating, I’m the motherfucking real one\n\nI used to think I was a fraud until I did some\n\nUntil I mufuckin did it...",
