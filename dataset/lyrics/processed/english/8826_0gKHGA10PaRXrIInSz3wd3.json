  "lyrics": "She ain't crazy like he said she was\r\nThere's no mistaking how it's all adding up\r\nLipstick on his collar, smoke from that revolver\r\nHe can try and call her crazy, oh but she ain't crazy\r\nBut she's going to make him pay\r\nYou can see it on her face\n\n\n\nBlack mascara, Moulin Rouge\n\nBlood red lipstick, high heeled shoes\n\nIt's her turn to do him wrong\n\nThat ain't makeup she got on\n\nIt's war paint, war paint\n\nGo on girl and make that man feel your pain, your pain\n\n\n\nNah she, she ain't leaving\n\n'Cause that won't hurt enough\n\nYeah she'll get even if it's the last thing that she does\n\nShe'll go undercover, find another lover\n\nHope that he'll discover what she's done\n\nNo she ain't leaving 'cause she's already gone\n\nThe battle lines are drawn\n\n\n\nBlack mascara, Moulin Rouge\n\nBlood red lipstick, high heeled shoes\n\nIt's her turn to do him wrong\n\nThat ain't makeup she got on\n\nIt's war paint, war paint\n\nHe's gonna see that two can play that game, that game\n\nThat ain't makeup she's got on\n\nIt's war paint, yeah\n\n\n\nBlack mascara, Moulin Rouge\n\nBlood red lipstick, high heeled shoes\n\nTwo wrongs ain't right but she don't care\n\nAll is fair tonight\n\nShe's wearing war paint\n\nGo on girl and make that man feel your pain, your pain\n\nHe's gonna see that two can play that game, that game\n\n'Cause that ain't makeup she got on\n\nIt's war paint",
