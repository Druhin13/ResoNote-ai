  "lyrics": "Those days it was all I wanted\r\nNowadays it feels all the same\r\nUsed to stare at my bedroom ceiling\r\nWishing everything could change\r\nNow it's hard when you're always searchin\r\nFor the life that you left behind\n\nTime disappears, year after year\n\nHow the hell did I get here? (Cuz)\n\n\n\nI feel so far away\n\nMinutes turn to hours and the hours into days\n\nI gave up everything\n\nYou don't know what you got until you throw it all away\n\nCuz I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I don't belong\n\nI don't belong\n\nI don't belong here, I don't belong here\n\nI don't belong\n\n\n\nLookin back on the past, all the time I wasted\n\nRunnin from everyone that tells me that I'm fadin out\n\nMust be mistaken cuz I, I, I don't feel anything\n\nYou know I got this brain, it drives me insane\n\nSome days I feel I can't take the pain, I'm gone\n\nI can't explain it cuz I, I, I don't need anything (no)\n\n\n\nI feel so far away\n\nMinutes turn to hours and the hours into days\n\nI gave up everything\n\nYou don't know what you got until you throw it all away\n\nCuz I don't belong here, I don't belong here, I don't belong\n\nI don't belong\n\nI don't belong here, I don't belong here\n\nI don't belong",
