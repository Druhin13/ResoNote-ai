  "lyrics": "I can hear the rain come down, I can listen with my heart\r\nI can see with both eyes closed in the dark\r\nSleep will come in just a while but till it does I choose\r\nTo listen to the rain, it's the rhythm of the blues\r\nI walk along these streets of home that once belonged to us\n\nAnd now baby I walk alone and I am lost\n\nIn the sound of my own footsteps on the avenues\n\nI guess I'm only walking to rhythm of the blues\n\n\n\nI don't wanna hear another word spoken, I don't wanna see another tear shed\n\nI can't seem to fix what's broken, like this record baby in my head\n\n\n\nLonely looks as bad on me as lonely looks on you\n\nAnd still we keep on moving to the rhythm of the blues\n\n\n\nI want a place to call my own, where you have never been\n\nI wanna look around and know you won't be coming back again\n\nOn some pretense paper-thin that I can see right through\n\nYou come and go baby, like the rhythm of the blues\n\nYou come and go baby, like the rhythm of the blues\n\nYou come and go baby, like the rhythm of the blues...",
