  "lyrics": "Break the fuckin' mirror 'cause I hate the image\r\nEvery single tear I cry is wasted liquid\r\nI fucked too many girls to count, I ain't commited\r\nI guess bein' an asshole was a bad decision\r\nThanks haters I love\n\nYou, no one above\n\nYou, I lost a thousand friends to threads, like where's the undo?\n\nTweetin' like I ain't affected by the hate directed every second, maybe I should take the weapon blow\n\n\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nMy serotonin\n\nI'm feelin' alone and the world is so cold\n\nIt's hard to focus\n\nWithout oxytocin\n\nLove is an ocean I can't control\n\n\n\nBreak up with my girl because she doesn't trust me\n\nI don't fuckin' blame her 'cause I trust in nothin'\n\nMama held a bottle, daddy doesn't hug me\n\nAll I ever wanted was someone to love me\n\n\n\nThanks doctor I need\n\nThoughts give me a free dose\n\nI took a thousand happy pills but I'm still emo\n\nActin' like I ain't affected by the hate directed every second\n\nMaybe I should fuckin' end it now\n\n\n\nWhere are you going\n\nMy serotonin\n\nI'm feelin' alone and the world is so cold\n\nIt's hard to focus\n\nWithout oxytocin\n\nLove is an ocean I can't control\n\n\n\nChemicals, chemicals in my brain\n\nWhere'd you go, where'd you go anyways?\n\nLeft a hole where the bad wants to stay\n\nEverything, everything goes away\n\nChemicals, chemicals in my brain\n\nWhere'd you go, where'd you go anyways?\n\nLeft a hole where the bad wants to stay\n\nEverything, everything goes away",
