  "lyrics": "I keep my distance\r\nAll the while\r\nCause I know you've been true\r\nTo your mind\r\nYou know I love you\n\nOh so well\n\nBut you know you have been\n\nDeceiving yourself\n\n\n\nYou know you cannot hide\n\nAll the time\n\nGotta grow into a mountain\n\nLittle child\n\n\n\nHow can I live\n\nGive it up\n\nWhen I have this funny feeling\n\nIn my gut\n\n\n\nAll I know\n\nThere's a fever I can't shake\n\nRoll the dice\n\nIn the night I held you down\n\nAll the same\n\nIn a place, I couldn't name\n\nYou're so far\n\nOn the other side of the day\n\nIs a star\n\n\n\nYou've got the answers\n\nIn your glove\n\nBut you've gotta take\n\nA leap of love\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know I know you\n\nBut I can't stay\n\nAnd you're headed down your own road",
