  "lyrics": "Don't feel inspired by the faces I see\r\nFlawless on socials, but can't possibly be\r\nThey're like someone imperfect, not even 18 on a screen\r\nI move onto someone else\r\nReady for complicated nights with just one\r\nI love the thrill, but chasing all of them is done\n\n'Cause soon as I act more than a late night, they run\n\nOh, they run, they move on to someone else\n\n\n\nI'm not looking for perfect, just for somebody who\n\nHolds it down when I'm hurting, lifts me up when I lose\n\nThere will be days when I can't function\n\nThere will be nights I won't sleep\n\nI'm not looking for perfect, just for somebody who takes it slow\n\nJust for somebody who takes it slow\n\n\n\nDon't need a subtle taste of what's left unseen\n\nThose odd behaviors, oh, they come off obscene\n\nYeah, I need a life of my own to blow off some steam\n\nThat doesn't meant that I don't want you (I don't want you)\n\n\n\nI'm not looking for perfect, just for somebody who\n\nHolds it down when I'm hurting, lifts me up when I lose\n\nThere will be days when I can't function\n\nThere will be nights I won't sleep\n\nI'm not looking for perfect, just for somebody who takes it slow",
