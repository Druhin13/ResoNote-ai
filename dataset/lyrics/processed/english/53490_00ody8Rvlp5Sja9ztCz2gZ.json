  "lyrics": "Birds flying over me\r\nAnd the tides reckless as the sea\r\nI was waiting for you\r\nAnd I see the lights\r\nIn the deep of your eyes\r\nWaves chasing down the tide\n\nI will last fearless by your side\n\n\n\nHigher than ever you're bringing me, baby\n\nAll that you want will be coming your way\n\nAnd the Sun it, it still shines\n\nAnd the flowers will bloom\n\nIn the moments we'll have\n\nWhen you open your eyes\n\n\n\nBreathless of holding you as mine\n\nAnd the seasons are planning all this time\n\nI was waiting for this in the cold night\n\nAnd the glee spreads in my mind\n\nI'll sing for the silence\n\nHoping someone would come wait for me\n\nHold you up to flower, I will call it our time\n\n'Cause you saved me with your love\n\n\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\nGive me your love tomorrow, babe\n\n\n\nHigher than ever you're bringing me, baby\n\n[?] will be singing your name\n\nAll that you want will be coming your way\n\n[?] will be singing your name\n\nAnd the Sun it, it still shines\n\nAnd the flowers will bloom\n\nIn the moments we'll have\n\nWhen you open your eyes\n\n\n\nHigher than ever you're bringing me, baby\n\n[?] will be singing your name\n\nAll that you want will be coming your way\n\n[?] will be singing your name\n\nAnd the Sun it, it still shines\n\nAnd the flowers will bloom\n\nIn the moments we'll have\n\nWhen you open your eyes\n\nAnd the flowers will bloom\n\nIn the moments we'll have\n\nWhen you open your eyes",
