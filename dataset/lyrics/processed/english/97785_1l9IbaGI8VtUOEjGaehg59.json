  "lyrics": "Something for nothing, couldn't pay the interest\r\nAway at the function, needed good resistance\r\nThinking I'll dive in, or maybe I might sit\r\nRight back where we started\r\nBut I know how to make you fuss, wanted\n\nJust wanted to make you blush, you're blushing\n\nSoaking up all my trust, knowing\n\nThat we've got lost, lost, lost\n\n\n\nGrowing devotion, but the water's tasteless\n\nCan tell that you rushing, knowing time is endless\n\nDoing me honest, straight as a promise\n\nRight back where we started\n\n\n\nBut I know how to make you fuss, wanted\n\nJust wanted to make you blush, you're blushing\n\nSoaking up all my trust\n\nKnowing that we've got lost, lost, lost\n\n\n\nBreak down enough no patience\n\nLow light to what you waiting on\n\nMake haste to let you go\n\nGo along\n\nBreak down enough no patience\n\nLow light to what you waiting on\n\nMake haste to this\n\nI owe you one, oh\n\n\n\nBut I know how to make you fuss, yeah\n\nJust wanted to make you blush\n\nSoaking up all my trust\n\nKnowing that we've got lost, lost, lost\n\nKnowing that we've got lost, lost, lost",
