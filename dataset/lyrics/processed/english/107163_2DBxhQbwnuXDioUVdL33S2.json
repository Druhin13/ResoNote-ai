Come along\n\n\n\n125 in the valley, treading on a heatwave\n\nI think we set the sky on fire, breathing in every day\n\nBefore you rise like a phoenix, you gotta play Jean Grey\n\nI just wanna flex, I don't wanna be another ex, yeah\n\nKeep it all up in my head now, when I see red, it's a let down\n\nAlways finding different ways to get down\n\nWhole wide world gone to shit now but I can't quit now\n\nNever been the type to just sit down\n\nAnd shut up, enemies tryna run up, homie, but I keep it all 100\n\nMinute that the sun up, I'm thinking 'bout the money\n\n\n\nYeah, it just might kill us all\n\nIt just might kill us all\n\nIt just might kill us all\n\nIt just might kill us all (yeah)\n\n\n\nFuck it, I love it\n\nHey, Jesse, run up the budget\n\n\n\nI don't know what kind of idiot you think is gonna fall for this scam but you people are in trouble. You contacted the wrong person, bye",
