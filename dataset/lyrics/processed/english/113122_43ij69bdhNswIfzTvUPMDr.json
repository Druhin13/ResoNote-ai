  "lyrics": "Walk away, if you want to\rIt´s okay, if you need to\rWell, you can run, but you can never hide\rFrom the shadow that´s creeping up beside you\rThere´s a magic running through your soul\rBut you can´t have it all\r(What ever you do)\rI´ll be two steps behind you\r(Where ever you go)\rAnd I´ll be there to remind you\rThat it only takes a minute of you precious time\rTo turn around, I´ll be two steps behind\rTake you time to think about it\rJust walk the line, you know you just can fight it\rTake a look around, you´ll see what you can find\rLike the fire that´s burning up inside me\rNow there´s a magic running through your soul\rBut you, you can´t have it all\r(What ever you do)\rI´ll be two steps behind you (Where ever you go)\rAnd I´ll be there to remind you\rThat it only takes a minute of you precious time\rTo turn around, I´ll be two steps behind",
