  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Somebody par Jillian Jacqueline\r\nMy happiness is a long shot short lived\nMy greener grass grows one town away\nThe only holiday I take is a guilt trip\nMy first impressions always saving face\nI'm good at crying when everything's alright\nI'm empathetic long as it don't cramp my style\nMy mother says I'm working in progress\nBut I think I might have it all worked out\n\nI got all of the truth that I need\nConfident of what I shouldn't be\nBut somehow through my insanity\nSomebody loves me\nSomebody loves me\n\nI had a handle on my baggage but I broke it\n\nI'm frontrunning the self-pity campaign\nThe only questions that I have are loaded\nBut I wouldn't have it any other way\n\nI got all of the truth that I need\nConfident of what I shouldn't be\nBut somehow through my insanity\nSomebody loves me\nSomebody loves\nAll my hell and my hurricane\nSpilling over like pink champagne\nI'm a wreck but it's plain to see\nSomebody loves me\nSomebody loves me\n\nSomebody, ooh, somebody\nSomebody, ooh, somebody loves\nSomebody, ooh, somebody\n\n\nMay not be a 10 but I'm always entertaining\nI may not win but I go all the way\n\nI got all of the truth that I need\nConfident of what I shouldn't be\nBut somehow through my insanity\nSomebody loves me\nSomebody loves\nAll my hell and my hurricane (all my hell)\nSpilling over like pink champagne (spilling over like pink champagne)\nI'm a wreck but it's plain to see\nSomebody loves me (somebody loves me)\nSomebody loves me\n\nSomebody, ooh, somebody\nSomebody, ooh, somebody loves\n\nSomebody, ooh, somebody\nSomebody, ooh, somebody loves\nSomebody, ooh, somebody\nSomebody, ooh, somebody loves\nSomebody, ooh, somebody\nSomebody, ooh, somebody loves",
