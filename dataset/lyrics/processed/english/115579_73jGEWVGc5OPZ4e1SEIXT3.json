(will you?)\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends?\n\nOne thing I can tell you for certain (one thing)\n\nLately, I been searchin' for my purpose (purpose)\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends? (will you)\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends? (show me)\n\n\n\nI built a hundred likes, flew a hundred skies\n\nWasn't fitted size, my chains shine like fireflies\n\nI smoke that inside, I smoke to come alive, huh\n\nEverything is do or die\n\nWhen you cross that line, no time to decide\n\nStep up in my mind, you might lose your life\n\nYou might lose your life, open up your mind\n\nOpen up your eyes, trip to paradise\n\nShawty never lies, you gon' roll the dice\n\nTrip to paradise, trip to paradise\n\n\n\nThere's one thing I can tell you for certain\n\nLately, I been searchin' for my purpose\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends? (will you?)\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends?\n\nOne thing I can tell you for certain (one thing)\n\nLately, I been searchin' for my purpose (purpose)\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends? (will you?)\n\nWill you show me where the earth ends? (show me)\n\n\n\nTrip to paradise",
