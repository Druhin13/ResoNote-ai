  "lyrics": "Well, my pad is very messy\r\nAnd there's whiskers on my chin\r\nAnd I'm all hung up on music\r\nAnd I always play to win\r\nI ain't got no time for loving\r\n'Cause my time is all used up\n\nJust to sit around creating\n\nAll that groovy kind of stuff\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm a man\n\nYes, I am\n\nAnd I can't help but love you so\n\nWell, I'm a man\n\nYes, I am\n\nAnd I can't help but love you so\n\n\n\nWell, if I had my choice of matter\n\nI would rather be with cats\n\nAll engrossed in mental chatter\n\nShowing where our minds are at\n\nAnd relating to each other\n\nJust how strong our will can be\n\nIn resisting all involvement\n\nWith each groovy chick we see\n\n\n\nWell, I'm a man\n\nYes, I am\n\nAnd I can't help but love you so\n\nWell, I'm a man\n\nYes, I am\n\nAnd I can't help but love you so\n\n\n\nSaid I got to keep my image\n\nWhile suspended on a throne\n\nThat looks out upon a kingdom\n\nFilled with people all unknown\n\nWho imagine I'm not human\n\nAnd my heart is made of stone\n\nAnd I never had no problems\n\nAnd my toilet's trimmed with gold\n\n\n\nWell, I'm a man\n\nYes, I am\n\nAnd I can't help but love you so\n\nWell, I'm a man\n\nYes, I am\n\nAnd I can't help but love you so",
