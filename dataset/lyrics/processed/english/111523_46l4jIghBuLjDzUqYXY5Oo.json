  "lyrics": "Waylon and Willie 2\r\nThey say, home is where the heart is, mama\r\nMade it out of that snake pit\r\nNow snake skin on these boot tips\r\nI see loose lips sank the last ship\n\nSo I set sail on a new trip\n\nSome mistakes I never make again\n\nCircle lot no one breaking in\n\nI gotta sit back and try to take it in\n\nI know perseverance, what it take to win\n\nHard to push when the world pull\n\nWhen the ones you love they try to burn you\n\nDeath coming smell her perfume\n\nTry to make it home before the curfew\n\nI was running late and the doors was locked\n\nAnd the windows too, no where to turn to\n\nAfter all the money I done burn through\n\nI woke up broke on a church pew\n\nWith a new goal in on a 45\n\nA fire in my eyes and some hunger pains\n\nI spent my younger day just chasing fame\n\nTo get burnt by the flames that money brings\n\nBlazed trails and I torched bridges\n\nAin't no turning back and I've moved on\n\nHome is where the heart is\n\nI've been heartless too long mama\n\n\n\nMama says, you can't go home\n\nYou can't go home, you can't go home\n\nMama says, you can't go home\n\nCan't go home, can't go home\n\n\n\nI've spent some time in the house of a rising son\n\nMirror on the wall I'm in fear of what I've become\n\nSame thing I'm living for, same thing I'm dying from\n\nMama says, you can't go home, you can't go home\n\nI've spent some time in the house of a rising son\n\nMirror on the wall I'm in fear of what I've become\n\nSame thing I'm living for, same thing I'm dying from\n\nMama says, you can't go home, you can't go home\n\n\n\nEarly in the morning breath stanking and yawning\n\nI can feel last night from the dranks and the yoda\n\nHeart beatin so fast I was thinkin its over\n\nNow my first thought is that I hate that I'm sober\n\nDealin with the demons that I can't get control of\n\nDealing with the ones that I can't get ahold of\n\nHow many day away from commitin a hold up\n\nTill we be patient and even the haters will show love\n\nMy brother told me Bubba get that check\n\nAnd don't worry about bullshit cuz you got next\n\nThen we know when you get it that you gonna flex\n\nThen I'll be overlooked like the New York Jets\n\nPay attention to them homies when they want for ya\n\nBack biting and acting like they get along which ya\n\nBut as soon as you catch a case and end you up in the place\n\nThe motherfucker won't even hit the phone for ya\n\nI've done seen them stand tall and I've seen 'em fall\n\nYou can't me shit I've done seen it all\n\nI ain't worried about chips, you can keep 'em all\n\nBut I promise you this I'm gonna bring it raw\n\nI'm just trying to put my people on\n\nI'm just trying to bounce some property from singing songs\n\nTrying to wake up from the cloud I've been dreaming on\n\nAnd I ain't planning on going back when I was leaving home\n\n\n\nMama says, you can't go home\n\nYou can't go home, you can't go home\n\nMama says, you can't go home\n\nCan't go home, can't go home\n\n\n\nI've spent some time in the house of a rising son\n\nMirror on the wall I'm in fear of what I've become\n\nSame thing I'm living for, same thing I'm dying from\n\nMama says, you can't go home, you can't go home\n\nCan't go home...\n\nI've spent some time in the house of a rising son\n\nMirror on the wall I'm in fear of what I've become\n\nSame thing I'm living for, same thing I'm dying from\n\nMama says, you can't go home, you can't go home",
