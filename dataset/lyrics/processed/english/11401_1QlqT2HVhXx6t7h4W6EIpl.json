  "lyrics": "I've been lost in the middle\r\nAlways trying to find the wishing well\r\nRunning around in circles\r\nNever crossing the line\r\nDon't want to touch you\n\nDon't want to see\n\nYou've got a knife in your heart\n\nDon't say that you did it for me\n\n\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nDon't tell me that the love is gone\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nCause there's always another turn\n\n\n\nYou know right where you want it\n\nBut you never gave it in return\n\nRunning me in circles\n\nAlways crossing the line\n\n\n\nDon't want to touch you\n\nLeave you confused\n\nYou took the easy way out\n\nWhen you looked through the eyes of a fool\n\n\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nDon't tell me that the love is strong\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nCause there's always another turn\n\n\n\nNever, never\n\nNever, never\n\n\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nDon't tell me that the love is gone\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nI'm never gonna set you free\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nDon't tell me that the love is gone\n\nNever unchain the night\n\nCause there's always another turn\n\nNever unchain the night",
