  "lyrics": "Hold your breath, don't look down, keep trying\r\nDarling, it's okay to be scared, it's frightening\r\nAt times it just feels like the world is trying hard to knock us down\r\nBut there's a reason that we're still here when no one else is around\r\nHow we've grown\n\nEvery single day I'm proud\n\nI swear, I won't\n\nLet anything stop us now\n\n\n\nI'm not a soldier\n\nBut I'll fight through our darkest of days\n\nGet on my shoulders\n\nAnd I'll carry you all of the way\n\n'Cause there's no life worth living in\n\nIf you're not with me in it\n\nI'm not a soldier\n\nBut you make me wanna be brave\n\nYeah, you do\n\n\n\nThrough the depths of despair, we've stumbled\n\nAnd all that distance between us, we've crumbled\n\nWe've ignored all of the rumours and jealous disapprovals\n\nAnd we've come out the other side with something beautiful\n\n\n\nOh, how we've grown\n\nEvery single day I'm proud\n\nAnd now I know\n\nThere's nothing that can stop us now\n\n\n\nI'm not a soldier\n\nBut I'll fight through our darkest of days\n\nGet on my shoulders\n\nAnd I'll carry you all of the way\n\n'Cause there's no life worth living in\n\nIf you're not with me in it\n\nI'm not a soldier\n\nBut you make me wanna be brave\n\nYeah, you do\n\n\n\nOnly we know where we're going\n\nEvery day we're gonna keep on growing\n\nLearning from the tears and the mistakes\n\nWe're not perfect but we've come such a long way\n\nAs long as I got you by my side\n\nI know what I wanna do in this life\n\nOne day when our kids fall in love\n\nWe can tell them that the odds were against us\n\n\n\nI'm not a soldier\n\nBut I'll fight through our darkest of days\n\nGet on my shoulders\n\nAnd I'll carry you all of the way, woo-ooh\n\n'Cause there's no life worth living in\n\nIf you're not with me in it\n\nI'm not a soldier (soldier)\n\nBut you make me wanna be brave\n\nYeah, you do\n\n\n\nYeah, you do, yeah, you do\n\nBut you make me wanna be brave\n\nYeah, you do\n\nOh yeah, you do",
