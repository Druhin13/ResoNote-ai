  "lyrics": "I used to waste time scrolling through my Facebook wall\r\n20 minutes of my life I could never get back\r\nCouple times a day, before I knew I’d lost an hour\r\nProductivity’d be far away like Okinawa\r\nFacebook friends are not my real amigos\r\nChecking for comments and shares jacking off my ego\n\nAnything to get a fucking “like”\n\nOne day I decided I should get a fucking life (Get it right)\n\nSocial networks are not the only infection\n\nGPS be fucking up cats’ sense of direction\n\nThought your navigation skills had to be fly\n\nYou ain’t know left from right when your battery died\n\nThe homies in your posse all be waiting\n\nBut you too busy checking Tumblr porno masturbating\n\nMaybe you should be a better friend\n\nNever use the internet again\n\n\n\nNever use the internet again! (Huh)\n\nNever use the internet again! (C'mon)\n\n\n\nEveryday the bullshit worsen\n\nOrder a pizza like a fucking person\n\nMatch.com like an online pimp\n\nStep to a girl in real life, you fucking wimp\n\nInternet journalism, here’s what you’re gonna find\n\nEveryone who can’t get paid for it does it online\n\nMost of the ones online that’s getting paid suck too\n\nFuck you!\n\nI swear I’m about to motherfucking lose it\n\nYouTube has ads on all the best music\n\nFor all the worst music, YouTube Awards?\n\nDid you forget? You can’t have awards you’re the fucking internet!\n\nThe shit is like a motherfucking drug\n\nThat all goes away if I pull the fucking plug\n\nPut your faith in something on which you can depend\n\nNever use the internet again\n\n\n\nNever use the internet again! (Huh)\n\nNever use the internet again! (C'mon)",
