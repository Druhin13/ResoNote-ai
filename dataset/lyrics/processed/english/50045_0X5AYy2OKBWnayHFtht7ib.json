  "lyrics": "Look around\r\nIn this ghost town\r\nHow could anyone fall in love?\r\nHow could anyone?\r\nIn the pale porchlights\r\nOf a satellite town\n\nNothing's going down\n\n\n\nMove along\n\nThrough the night\n\nUnder homesick trees\n\nThey're by\n\nThe riverside\n\nIn the pale grey days\n\nOf falling rain\n\nIt's all the same\n\n\n\nCome below with me\n\nI wanna show you the valley\n\nCome below with me\n\nI wanna show you the valley\n\nWhere we can fear; where we can fear\n\nWe can fear...surrender\n\nWhere we can fear; where we can fear\n\nWe can fear...surrender\n\n\n\nOutside in the street\n\nIt's darker than sleep\n\nI can't seem to hold on\n\nIn this concrete sea\n\nNo geometry\n\nI awoke in a dream\n\nRising and falling\n\nIn a concrete sea\n\n\n\nMove along\n\nThrough the night\n\nPast the empty homes\n\nThat dot the skylight\n\nThrough the pale moonlight\n\nAnd the come-down\n\nOf satellite town\n\n\n\nCome below with me\n\nI wanna show you the valley\n\nCome below with me\n\nI wanna show you the valley\n\nWhere we can fear; where we can fear\n\nWe can fear...surrender\n\nWhere we can fear; where we can fear\n\nWe can fear...surrender",
