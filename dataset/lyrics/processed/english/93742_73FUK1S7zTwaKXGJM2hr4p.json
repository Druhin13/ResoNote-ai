  "lyrics": "She was a sometimes love\r\nAn every-now-and-then touch\r\nThat momentarily\r\nBrought out the best in me\r\nI didn't think that much of it\r\nMy heart can easily love it or leave it\n\nTold myself I didn't need it\n\n\n\nAnd years have gone by\n\nShe's moved on, so have I\n\nOr have I?\n\nThat part of my life\n\nThat chapter I thought I'd closed\n\nI close my eyes, but she's not gone\n\nOh, why am I still holding on?\n\nSometimes, love hangs around a little too long\n\n\n\nI never thought a thing about the things I said to her\n\nAnd her to me\n\nLove was just a word and all our promises we never meant to keep\n\nOr so I thought\n\nShe was a sometimes love\n\nBut sometimes, love hangs around a little too long\n\n\n\nAnd years have gone by\n\nShe's moved on, so have I\n\nOr have I?\n\nThat part of my life\n\nThat chapter I thought I'd closed\n\nI close my eyes, but she's not gone\n\nOh, why am I still holding on?\n\nShe was a sometimes love\n\nBut sometimes, love hangs around a little too long\n\nSometimes, love hangs around a little too long",
