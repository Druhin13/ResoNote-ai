  "lyrics": "Most of the time I was speakin' my mind\r\nI wasn't listenin that often, I had so little to offer\r\nSpent a lot thinkin' of these things and I finally see what it cost me\r\nYou had a hold on me but I'm finally free from exhaustion\r\nFreedom of speech, now we talkin'\r\nBut always say less than what's necessary\n\nDid you get my messages?\n\nThey were heaven sent, keep us safe from the adversary\n\nThese lessons, I soaked 'em in 'til they resonate\n\nI'm in a better place, and didn't have to get buried\n\nTo get here, let that marinate\n\nLet the deaf hear it, let the blind see it\n\n\n\nHeavenly father, Where do I start?\n\nThere's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart\n\nHeavenly father, Where do I start?\n\nThere's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart\n\nHeavenly father, Where do I start?\n\nThere's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart\n\nHeavenly father, Where do I start?\n\nThere's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart",
