  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lisa, Robbi, and Me par Major Murphy\r\nHer name is Lisa, she’s got me insane\nAll in my mind, yeah, I’m calling her name\nShe’s got a fever of 105, fire in her eyes\nYeah, I know she’s alive alright, tonight can’t turn out the light\nI think you know exactly what I’m talking about Love, of the finest kind\nThat’s right Lisa, I wanna blow your mind\n\nSea punk mama with the hair colored blue\nYou’re weak in the knees when she’s looking at you\nDigital daddy with the chip in his brain\nTrying to be cool but he’s really quite lame I’m afraid, it’s a shame\nMy friend Robbi, says he’s a man want’s the whole world in the palm of his hand\n\nBut he can feel it all slipping away but he’s holding on tight\nYea he’s gonna stay alright, tonight, won’t turn out the light\n\nI think you know exactly what Robbi is talking about\nLove in the nick of time\nCome on Robbi, let’s go for a ride\nAlright, tonight, just one more time\nYou know the one thing you cannot explain\nDoesn’t make sense, refuses a name\nWell it’s the one thing we’re holding onto\nOne things that’s real one thing that’s true\nI know we’re changing everyday\nIt’s easy to know but it’s harder to say\nThe whole world is going right down the drain\nIf it’s sad then it’s true but there’s still another way\n\nYeah, it’s gonna be ok\n\nCause I’ve got you baby, I’ve got you, baby\nI got you baby, on my mind all of the time\n\nI got you baby\nI got you, baby\nI got you, baby\nOn my mind all of the time\n\nI got you\nI got you\nI got you",
