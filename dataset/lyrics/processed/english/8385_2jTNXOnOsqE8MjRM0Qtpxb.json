  "lyrics": "You're on a shadow of a dark\r\nYou're someone, I can't live without\r\nSure the sun is gonna rise, I'll be there, by your side\r\n'Cause I won't ever leave you, won't ever go\r\nI'll be the ground under your feet\n\nAnd I'll work for you baby\n\nFingers to the bone\n\nDo you smile, I ain't gonna sleep\n\n'Cause without you, there's no me\n\n\n\nNow I'm the shadow of a dark\n\nI was wrong, I can see it now\n\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n\nSometimes we lost, but sometimes we get saved\n\n\n\nAnd I won't ever leave you, won't ever go\n\nI'll be the ground under your feet\n\nAnd I'll work for you baby\n\nFingers to the bone\n\nDo you smile, I ain't gonna sleep\n\n'Cause without you, there's no me\n\n\n\nNights are getting colder\n\nYour love brings the heat\n\nPut my arm around your shoulder\n\nPlease stand by me, stand by me\n\n\n\n'Cause I won't ever leave you, won't ever go\n\nI'll be the ground under your feet\n\nAnd I'll work for you baby\n\nFingers to the bone\n\nDo you smile, I ain't gonna sleep\n\nWithout you, without you, there's no me",
