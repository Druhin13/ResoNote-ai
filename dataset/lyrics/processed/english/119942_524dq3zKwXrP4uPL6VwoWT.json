  "lyrics": "Don’t cut the lights\r\nJust take it slow\r\nWe’re moving fast\r\nWe’ve lost control\r\nBut, I feel safe with you\r\nLove is brave, but I’ve been scared\n\nI look around, see no one there\n\nAnd still feel close to you\n\n‘Cause my life is like a bedroom door\n\nDon’t lead me in when you feel low\n\n‘Cause I might make a move\n\n\n\nSo what should I do in the darkness of you\n\nWhen you light up my moon from July until June\n\nWhat would I do if there wasn’t a you\n\nWould you sing about me like I sing about you\n\n\n\nYou’re my sunshine\n\nYou’re my rain\n\nYou’re all I’ve lost\n\nYet all I’ve gained\n\nIf I must tell the truth\n\nHello darkness, goodbye light\n\nI’ll kiss you close and hold you tight\n\nIf that’s alright with you\n\nI’m coming back if that’s alright with you\n\nSo come on back if that’s alright with you\n\n\n\nSo what should I do when I’m dark and I’m blue\n\nWhen you light up my room from July until June\n\nWhat would I do if there wasn’t a you\n\nWould you sing about me like I sing about you\n\n\n\n‘Cause all I see are yellow lights, yellow lights, yellow lights\n\nMeet me under yellow lights, yellow lights, yellow lights\n\nWe’re burning through these yellow lights, yellow lights, yellow lights\n\nWhen I’m with you\n\n\n\nWhat should I do in the darkness of you\n\nWhen you light up my moon from July until June\n\nWhat would you do if I died before you\n\nWould you sing about me like I sing about you",
