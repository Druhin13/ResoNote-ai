  "lyrics": "The tarot is fate, said the Gypsy Queen\r\nAnd she beckoned me, to glimpse my future she'd seen\r\nShe said, do you see what I see?, be careful to choose\r\nBe careful what you wish for, cause it may come true\r\nWhen I lay the card down will it turn up the fool?\n\nWill it turn up sorrow? If it does then you lose\n\n\n\nI'm the lost boy can you help me\n\nYeah, I'm the lost boy can you help me\n\n\n\nThen the illusion was real, a crimson idol I saw\n\nBut the higher he'd fly, then the further he'd fall\n\n\n\nI'm the lost boy can you help me\n\nYeah, I'm the lost boy can you help me\n\n\n\nI just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be\n\nThe crimson Idol of a million\n\nI just wanna be, I just wanna be, I just wanna be\n\nThe crimson Idol of a million eyes\n\nOf a million",
