  "lyrics": "Self made since twelfth grade, this my calling\r\nEvery jewel I drop is money out the sky falling\r\nEl is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting\r\nMy pen bleed while yours be blood clotting\r\nDo I give 'em pay or give 'em mercy? Decisions, decisions\n\nThey say my bars set 'em free in all the prison divisions\n\nThese weaklings, known as foes, are likely not on the hills of this\n\nStand up nigga, always thinking on his toes\n\n\n\nSelf made since twelfth grade, that's my calling\n\nEvery jewel I drop is money out the sky falling\n\nLike it's raining on a stripper I was eyeballing\n\nFaces in my lap, fingers up my thigh crawling\n\nEl is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting\n\nMy pen bleed while yours be blood clotting\n\n\n\nWord, he finna spaz\n\nMe get ate? Not on my watch\n\nIt could be half past 7, then thirty minutes pass\n\nScience and dollar signs are underneath my D fitted\n\nSaw a light at the end of the tunnel, I lit my tree with it\n\nThat's just how I'm blazing, nothing short of amazing\n\nHad a brush with death and all it did was make my waves spin\n\nNumero uno, owning watches made by Hublot\n\nEvery time I step it up, y'all put the stoop down to a new low\n\nEither do more planning or shoot yourself in the foot with the four cannon\n\nAnd hit the floor landing where you're standing\n\n\n\nSelf made since twelfth grade, this my calling\n\nEvery jewel I drop is money out the sky falling\n\nEl is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting\n\nMy pen bleed while--\n\n\n\nMight pull up on you in the Q50 Infinite then park\n\nYou a infant in shark water, marauder throwing shots against a infinite spark\n\nInside the boundary of a city state and county\n\nWas down to put a bounty on my head before they crowned me\n\nGiving me more reasons to pour Riesling\n\nAnd activate the door keys in the Four Seasons\n\nWhere I'm from make the news that'll interrupt a program\n\nSome will face the music, others caught up in a slow jam\n\nAnd took away the hoop goals, to know that I can show you the ropes\n\nOr strangle you with them if you looking for some loopholes\n\nWhat's in my bio is hazardous and it's vile\n\nIt's matches in gas chambers, a water gun in Ohio\n\nAn asteroid in the troposphere speeding towards a hopeless mere\n\nMortal, others appear normal through my ear portal\n\nY'all would hate if next year I'm in the McLarens, yea\n\nHere and there I see y'all got angles, y'all don't play fair and square\n\nAll I push is mind power, screw zombies\n\nThey brainwashed while my brainwaves is tsunamis\n\nThe small beaches on a island with a few palm trees\n\nIs bars for you gun toters who pursue crime sprees\n\n\n\nSelf made since twelfth grade, this my calling\n\nEvery jewel I drop is money out the sky falling\n\nEl is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting\n\nMy pen bleed while yours be blood clotting\n\nSelf made since twelfth grade, this my calling\n\nEvery jewel I drop is money out the sky falling\n\nEl is that nigga, some of y'all forgotten what I'm jotting\n\nMy pen bleed while yours be blood clotting",
