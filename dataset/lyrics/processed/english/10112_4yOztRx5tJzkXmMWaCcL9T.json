  "lyrics": "Fear\r\nOh, don't you feel fear\r\nOf all the stupid things\r\nA man could feel\r\nWhile his freedom rings\r\nHe squanders the deal\n\nWhat am I, blind?\n\nWhat took me this long?\n\nCan't we hit rewind\n\nOn somebody's magic bong? Oh\n\n\n\nCome back and touch my face\n\nFeel for fever in the night\n\nYou look into my eyes\n\nYou don't really recognize me anymore\n\n\n\nPassed another pointless year\n\nFoaming at the mouth\n\nI with my hands ever up\n\nAnd yours stretching out\n\nI know I've run out of luck\n\nThis fear is a terrible drug\n\nIf I only had sense enough\n\nTo let it give way to love\n\n\n\nCome back and touch my face\n\nFeel for fever in the night\n\nYou look into my eyes\n\nYou don't really recognize me anymore\n\nNo, no, no\n\nNo, no",
