  "lyrics": "Is this the life that we're living?\r\nSay the prayers in a thousand tongues\r\nIs this love? Some new beginning?\r\nOr a night in our wildest dreams?\r\nInto the great wide open\n\nAcross a land of blood and dreams\n\nI will save your heart from breaking\n\nWon't you stop? Please\n\nSet me free\n\n\n\nI swear to God, I'm the devil\n\nRaise your hands to the sky and praise\n\nI'm a thief, you're a liar\n\nBut we live in our wildest dreams\n\n\n\nInto the great wide open\n\nAcross a land of blood and dreams\n\nI will save your heart from breaking\n\nWon't you stop? Please\n\nSet me free, set me free\n\nSet me free, set me free\n\n\n\nLet it out, let it out, go\n\nTime to lay down your arms\n\nLet it out, let it out, go\n\nTime to lay down your arms, ooh\n\n\n\nInto the great wide open\n\nAcross a land of love and dreams\n\nI will save your heart from breaking\n\nWon't you stop? Please\n\nSet me free (Raise your hands to the sky)\n\nSet me free (Raise your hands to the sky)\n\nSet me free (Raise your hands to the sky)\n\nWon't you stop? Please\n\nSet me free",
