Nigga, we go way back\n\nTo when I had the braids and you had the wave cap\n\nDrop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP\n\nDon't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that\n\nPay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed\n\nThey wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)\n\nAll you gotta do is speak on Ye\n\nAll you gotta do is speak on Ye\n\nDon't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay",
