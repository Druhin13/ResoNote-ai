  "lyrics": "Should I be waiting on the high life\r\nWhere we all drink champagne\r\nFly first class on jet planes\r\nRub shoulders in the right way\r\nWe had a conversation about how I should be received\n\nAnd everyone agreed\n\nEveryone except me\n\n\n\nHow maybe I’m selfish\n\nCould be obscene\n\nBut it feels like home\n\nWhen you’re next to me\n\nAnd I don’t want to leave\n\n\n\nIf I had a choice\n\nWell then I’d choose\n\nTo make you walk a mile in my shoes\n\nWhat have you got to lose?\n\n\n\nSo I’ve been waiting for an opportunity\n\nJust to speak my mind\n\nIf that’s alright\n\nMight just be a couple hours out of my whole week\n\nUsually I’m fine\n\nIt’s ok not to be ok, sometimes\n\n\n\nI’ve been looking for some comfort in a strangers bed\n\nAll it does is f*** my head up\n\nNow I’m right back to square one\n\n\n\nBut if you’re looking for some comfort you’ve come to the right place\n\nWe all get down some days\n\nI struggle just to put my t-shirt on\n\nBut I hope you find some strength in this song\n\n\n\nMaybe I’m selfish\n\nCould be obscene\n\nBut I’m just trying to make you see what I see\n\nEveryone’s like me\n\n\n\nSo I’ve been waiting for an opportunity\n\nJust to speak my mind\n\nIf that’s alright\n\nMight just be a couple hours out of my whole week\n\nUsually I’m fine\n\nIt’s ok not to be ok, sometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nSometimes",
