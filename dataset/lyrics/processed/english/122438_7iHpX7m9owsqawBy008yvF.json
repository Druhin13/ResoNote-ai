  "lyrics": "I was born to fly away\r\nAnd run across the sun\r\nIt faded out\r\nLike a candle in the breeze\r\nFadin' out\r\nLike I'm supposed to\n\n\n\nSo everyday I'm against the wall\n\nWith nowhere to turn to\n\nAnd if I dare to believe at all\n\nIt leaves me deflated\n\n\n\nMy mind begins to strain\n\nAnd my thoughts begin to run\n\nI've played it out\n\nI can't seem to find the peace\n\nI've heard about\n\nAm I not supposed to?\n\n\n\nSo every day I could lose it all\n\nDon't let this concern you\n\nSo will you catch me if I fall\n\nAnd keep me elated\n\nIt's not complicated\n\n\n\nIf I knew I could change it all\n\nI'd hope that you waited\n\n(Can't be broken down)\n\nIf I knew I could change it all\n\nI'd hope that you waited\n\n(Can't be broken down)\n\n\n\nCan't be broken down \n\nCan't be broken down\n\nCan't be broken down\n\nCan't be broken down",
