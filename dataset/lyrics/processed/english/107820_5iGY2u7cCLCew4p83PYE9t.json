It don't matter anyway\n\nWe the same energy, so you matter anyway\n\nIf I bust a fifty shot, they gon' scatter every way\n\nIf I hit a couple niggas, they gon' splatter every way\n\nBut I ain't on that time, I'm just really on the peace vibe\n\nTryna burn the leaf, make this money on the creep time\n\nI'm a cold-hearted goon, anytime is heat-time\n\nEarned a little money, homie, I'm just tryna keep mine\n\n\n\nI am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind\n\nMeetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line\n\nStraight like six o'clock when I came with the nine\n\nBut then I had to grow, so I made my design\n\nI am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind\n\nMeetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line\n\nStraight like six o'clock when I came with the nine\n\nBut then I had to grow, so I made my design\n\n\n\nSelf made, self medicated\n\nIce cube, Rubik's cube, mix should be celebrated\n\nThe cold puzzle\n\nI rest where your soul goes to sleep forever\n\nYou should know, Cuzzo\n\nYou fuckin' with the homie from the haunted house\n\nI could talk to the night and bring the mornin' out\n\nRelated to the sands in the hourglass\n\nIt's happy G Day when the hour pass\n\nPlant a seed of love when a flower pass\n\nAlways pay attention when the coward pass\n\nI'm here to get paid with the times, made man\n\nI told you that I made my design\n\n\n\nI am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind\n\nMeetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line\n\nStraight like six o'clock when I came with the nine\n\nBut then I had to grow, so I made my design\n\nI am self made, yeah, I stayed on the grind\n\nMeetin' with the plug, caught the weight off the line\n\nStraight like six o'clock when I came with the nine\n\nBut then I had to grow, so I made my design\n\n\n\nI made my design\n\nSelf made\n\nL-O-X, D-Block\n\nOne third of the Trinity, S-P the Ghost\n\nSalute\n\nLove is love\n\nOne",
