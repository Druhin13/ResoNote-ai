  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Howl par Years & Years\r\nIt seems, it seems mighty treacherous\nA superstition leads me\nMaybe, maybe it's getting dangerous\nI'm counting symbols: one, two, three\n\nSomething in the water\nIs it me that's going under?\nI'm shaking\nPsychic kind of power\nNow's the time, and now's the hour of making\nOoh\n\nSo help me God\nWhere am I now?\n(I'm afraid, I'm afraid in the future crowd)\nI cut my hair\n\nI shot them down\n(I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm dreaming)\nCan you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?\n(Say, can you hear me?)\nCan you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl (howl)?\n(Say, can you hear me howl?)\n\nI was, I was young and untamed\nDancing like my mother\nI pray, I pray we will be safe\nThough we may uncover\n\nSomething in the water\nI can't help, I'm going under\nOh, save me\nPsychic kind of power\nIt's my time, and it's my hour of making\n\nOoh\n\nSo help me God\nWhere am I now?\n(I'm afraid, I'm afraid in the future crowd)\nI cut my hair\nI shot them down\n(I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm dreaming)\nCan you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?\n(Say, can you hear me?)\nCan you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl (howl)?\n(Say, can you hear me howl?)\n\nStanding in front of the hungriest crowd\nNothing will stop me from screaming out loud\nI am the wolf and the enemy now\nSay, can you hear me, ooh?\n\nOoh, ooh\nNo, no, no\n\nSo help me God\nWhere am I now?\n(I'm afraid, I'm afraid in the future crowd)\nI cut my hair\nI shot them down\n(I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm dreaming)\nCan you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl?\n(Say, can you hear me?)\nCan you hear, can you hear, can you hear me howl (howl)?\n(Say, can you hear me howl?)\n\nSay, can you hear me?\nSay, can you hear me howl?",
