What you thinking?\n\n\n\nLet's take it easy, easy\n\n'Cause that's all that it needs to be\n\nI'll make it easy, easy\n\nOh, that's all that it needs to be\n\nIt should be easy\n\nIt should be easy\n\nIt should be easy\n\n\n\nOh, I don't understand what went wrong\n\n'Cause it's clear enough\n\nThat you're so in your head\n\nDon't you know there's no fear in love?\n\n\n\nTell me how it's gonna go down?\n\nGot a feeling (I got a feeling)\n\nBaby, you don't gotta freak out\n\nYou can need me (You can need me)\n\nLet me in on all of your doubts\n\nWhat you thinking?
