  "lyrics": "A breath away from calling\r\nWill I regret it in the morning?\r\nI'm dangerously lonely, yeah\r\nAin't seen you in a minute\r\nAin't nothing changed, now you still feel it\r\nBut I'm bad at keeping secrets, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd I need a drink to be bold\n\nIt's hard to commit when I'm sober\n\nSo dangerous when I'm alone\n\nSo stay with me till we're hungover\n\n\n\nGo\n\nOnce I start sipping\n\nI need bold\n\nAnd it feels so good I might just let it go, go\n\nLet it go go\n\nI let it go go\n\nAnd it feels so good I might just let it go\n\n\n\nWon't listen to my conscience\n\nBut I'm still being cautious\n\nI'm drunk and being honest, yeah\n\nAnd all the things I won't do\n\nI'll be considering after just two\n\nI need the liquor just to get through\n\n\n\nAnd I need a drink to be bold\n\nIt's hard to commit when I'm sober\n\nSo dangerous when I'm alone\n\nSo stay with me till we're hungover\n\n\n\nGo\n\nOnce I start sipping\n\nI need bold\n\nAnd it feels so good I might just let it go, go\n\nLet it go go\n\nI let it go go\n\nAnd it feels so good I might just let it go\n\n\n\nToo loose off eights and this rum\n\nTo ever bite on my tongue\n\nI'm bold, I'm typing in bold when I text you baby uh-huh\n\nThis liquor got me on one\n\nNo filter, say what I want\n\nThe most truthful when I'm drunk off love, feel like half a month\n\nToo weak to lie about how I feel about you\n\nToo grown to lie about how I feel about you\n\nTwo lies I tell if well I lie then try to say I ain't wanna lie around you\n\nThat's the truth\n\nIt's in her spirit, I had to let this loose, go!\n\n\n\nGo\n\nOnce I start sipping\n\nI need bold\n\nAnd it feels so good I might just let it go, go\n\nLet it go go\n\nI let it go go\n\nAnd it feels so good I might just let it go",
