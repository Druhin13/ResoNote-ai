  "lyrics": "While window shopping through the past\r\nI ran across a looking glass\r\nReflecting moments remaining in a burned out light\r\nTragic magic prayers of passion\r\nStay the same through changing fashions\r\nThey freeze my mind like water on a winter's night\n\n\n\nSpent most of my youth\n\nOut hobo cruising\n\nAnd all I got for proof\n\nIs rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes\n\nSo goodbye nonbeliever\n\nDon't you know that I hate to leave here\n\nSo long babe, I got the flashback blues.\n\n\n\nPhotographs show the laughs\n\nRecorded in between the bad times\n\nHappy sailors dancing on a sinking ship\n\nCloudy skies and dead fruit flies\n\nWaving goodbye with tears in my eyes\n\nWell, sure I made it but ya know it was as hell of a trip.\n\n\n\nSpent most of my youth\n\nOut hobo cruising\n\nAnd all I got for proof\n\nIs rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes\n\nAnd ten times what it grieves you\n\nThat's how much more I hate to leave you now\n\nSo long babe, I got the flashback blues.\n\n\n\nSpent most of my youth\n\nOut hobo cruising\n\nAnd all I got for proof\n\nIs rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes\n\nSo goodbye nonbeliever\n\nDon't you know that I hate to leave here\n\nSo long babe, I got the flashback blues.",
