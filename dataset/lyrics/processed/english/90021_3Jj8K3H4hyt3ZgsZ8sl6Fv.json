  "lyrics": "The power of love is a curious thing\r\nMake a one man weep, make another man sing\r\nChange a hawk to a little white dove\r\nMore than a feeling that's the power of love\r\nTougher than diamonds, rich like cream\r\nStronger and harder than a bad girl's dream\n\nMake a bad one good make a wrong one right\n\nPower of love that keeps you home at night\n\n\n\nYou don't need money, don't take fame\n\nDon't need no credit card to ride this train\n\nIt's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes\n\nBut it might just save your life\n\nThat's the power of love\n\nThat's the power of love\n\n\n\nFirst time you feel it, it might make you sad\n\nNext time you feel it, it might make you mad\n\nBut you'll be glad baby when you've found\n\nThat's the power makes the world go'round\n\n\n\nAnd it don't take money, don't take fame\n\nDon't need no credit card to ride this train\n\nIt's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes\n\nBut it might just save your life\n\n\n\nThey say that all in love is fair\n\nYeah, but you don't care\n\nBut you know what to do\n\nWhen it gets hold of you\n\nAnd with a little help from above\n\nYou feel the power of love\n\nYou feel the power of love\n\nCan you feel it?\n\nHmmm\n\n\n\nIt don't take money and it don't take fame\n\nDon't need no credit card to ride this train\n\nTougher than diamonds and stronger than steel\n\nYou won't feel nothin' till you feel\n\nYou feel the power, just feel the power of love\n\nThat's the power, that's the power of love\n\nYou feel the power of love\n\nYou feel the power of love\n\nFeel the power of love",
