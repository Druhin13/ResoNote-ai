  "lyrics": "I'll shoot you dead\r\nFor the father\r\nOf the coal miner's daughter\r\nBeneath the icicle tusk\r\nYou and me among the flattering dusk\n\nIn my haste I draw my weapon\n\nDesigning your final lesson\n\nAs you recede to the floor\n\nAll is silent but the fluttering door\n\n\n\nTwenty-five grand on the table\n\nOf the high wall street stable\n\nI'm not responsible for\n\nThe reputation of the\n\nNeighborhood whore\n\n\n\nBut I'm a keyhole peeker\n\nAnd you're my surveilance keeper\n\nAnd though my memory rusts\n\nI will always see the icicle tusk\n\n\n\nAnd I must admit\n\nThat it gets lonesome on my shelf\n\nThis much I can tell\n\nThis much I can tell",
