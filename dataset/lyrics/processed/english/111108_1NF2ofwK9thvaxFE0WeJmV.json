  "lyrics": "Oh, oh oh, oh\r\nI've been drinking fast\r\nTime creeping slow\r\nWithstand through the tainted van\r\nStand clear doors are closing\n\nOh this is not peace of mind\n\nDoin' time travel through the middle of the night\n\nRockville train, I like to feel this pass me by and\n\n\n\nTime sit still, this moment\n\nTime sit still, this moment\n\nTime sit still, this moment\n\nThis moment, this moment\n\n\n\nJumpcut fadeway to a post fly on a drop a van\n\nStuck in flux top, levitate, the view\n\nBlacks out and I'm frozen while the rain falls deeper\n\nCabin fever, really ain't a man to you, the humanoid's lethal\n\nLost in Saturdays, spiderwebs of love\n\nThe complex caravan of people givin' up\n\nBut baby if it's working, working\n\nAnd now we meet it's worth it, worth it\n\nI'd prove, I think our time stood still this moment\n\nSomeone save me from the mid-night truth I'm learning, ooh\n\n\n\nTime sit still, this moment\n\nTime sit still, this moment\n\nTime sit still, this moment\n\nThis moment, this moment\n\n\n\nThis moment, this moment\n\nThis moment",
