  "lyrics": "The night is like a lovely tune\nBeware my foolish heart\nHow white the ever constant moon\nTake care my foolish heart\n\nThere's a line between love and fascination\n\nThat's hard to see, how many names such as this\n\nFor they both have the very same sensation\n\nWhen you're locked in the magic of a kiss\n\n\n\nHer lips are much too close to mine\n\nBeware my foolish heart\n\nBut should our eager lips combine\n\nThen let the fire start\n\n\n\nFor this time it isn't fascination\n\nOr a dream that will fade and fall apart\n\nIt's love, this time it's love\n\nMy foolish heart",
