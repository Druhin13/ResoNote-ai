Anything in inside?\n\nOh, Iʼm afraid of it\n\nClose the blinds, mmm\n\nIn a stairway, stuck inside\n\nI hear the doorbell ring\n\nLook out the blinds, who is it?\n\nThink I lost my head space/ black and white, that's how death tastes/ I'm getting\n\nReal sick of my desk, clock ticks slow down, mother fuck a day job, who needs a\n\nNest egg/ ya, ya, ya I've been kicked out my nest, I guess I'll never see those bed\n\nStains/ again, all of my bags are dead weight/ the meds all pouring out my likes for\n\nDef things/ let the creek run dry/ mind sleeps, while Im hiding, I always peep one\n\nEye/ internet kids, never beat my odds, so leap behind/ let the creek run out/ mind\n\nSleeps, while my eyes steep, I always know to keep one down/ from me to me\n\nThere will always be one crown\n\nAll these voices in my head wonʼt go away\n\nItʼs my paradise, itʼs my novocaine\n\nSo numb to the soul casing\n\nI canʼt feel anything, Iʼm black and blue shaking\n\nAll these voices in my head wonʼt go away\n\nTheyʼve built a paradise, itʼs my novocaine\n\nSo numb to the soul casing\n\nI canʼt feel anything, Iʼm black and blue shaking\n\nOooooh\n\nIʼm black and blue shaking\n\nOooooh\n\nIʼm black and blue shaking",
