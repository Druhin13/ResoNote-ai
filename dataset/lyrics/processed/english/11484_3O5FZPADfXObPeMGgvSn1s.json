  "lyrics": "This is now the end of the story\r\nYou're gone, we're here, the lines blur\r\nI hope you find a life filled with glory\r\nBuried in the grave of your words\r\nThese are the same hands\n\nRebuilding a kingdom\n\nBut you are not the prodigal son\n\nThese are the same hands\n\nThat cure the infection\n\nFor we are not the only ones\n\n\n\nNo more lies, no more tales\n\nI don't have the strength\n\nTo hate another word\n\nNo more lies, no more tales\n\nYou're the name I wish that I had never heard\n\n\n\nThis is what you wanted\n\nTear down from under\n\nLive with the choices\n\nThere won't be another\n\nThat's what you paid for\n\nTo live, live as a pauper\n\nNow end your bloodline\n\nYou've nothing left to offer\n\n\n\nThis is now the end of the story\n\nYou're gone, we're here, the last word\n\n\n\nThese are the same hands\n\nRebuilding a kingdom\n\nBut you are not the prodigal son\n\nThese are the same hands\n\nThat cure the infection\n\nFor we are not the only ones\n\n\n\nNo more lies, no more tales\n\nI still hear you, turn away from Judas' kiss\n\nNo more lies, no more tales\n\nTake away every thought that you exist\n\n\n\nThis is now the end of the story\n\nYou're gone, we're here, the air's clear\n\nYour picture's all that's left of the journey\n\nAnd I pray you never reappear",
