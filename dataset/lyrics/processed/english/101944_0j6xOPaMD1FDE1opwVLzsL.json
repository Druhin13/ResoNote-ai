  "lyrics": "Mmmm\r\nI love it when you play it like that\r\nCome on... Play\r\nSittin' here alone I'm lookin' back on where I've roamed\r\nAnd laughing how I swore I'd win and not get burned\n\nLeft my family\n\nLeft my home\n\nI worked my fingers to the bone\n\nAnd there was not a stone I did not leave unturned\n\nAnd I was havin' a good time\n\n\n\nRoll on Roll on Roller Coaster\n\nWe're one day older and one step closer\n\nRoll on there's mountains to climb\n\nRoll on we're on borrowed time\n\nRoll on Roller coaster\n\nRoll on tonight\n\nRoll on tonight yeah\n\n\n\nMoney and success\n\nI don't complain about the stress\n\nI wanted this and now it's here\n\nSo I don't bitch\n\nAnd I swear that time's a trick\n\nIt disappears in oh so quick\n\nMan I was just sixteen\n\nAnd now I'm starin' at thirty-six\n\nBut I'm still havin' a good time\n\n\n\nRoll on Roll on Roller Coaster\n\nWe're one day older and one step closer\n\nRoll on there's mountains to climb\n\nRoll on we're on borrowed time\n\nRoll on Roller coaster\n\nRoll on tonight\n\nRoll on tonight\n\n\n\nAnd I know it's hard to see with the sun in your eyes\n\nBut one day you're gonna say I saw the light\n\n\n\nAnd now headin' for the hill\n\nAnd I just cannot wait until\n\nMy children grow up to have children of their own\n\nAnd I'll be telling them about\n\nThe times I turned the party out\n\nAnd how I stood against an army all alone\n\nDrinkin' wine and stayin' high\n\nAnd realized it couldn't last\n\nAnd how I turned myself around\n\nAnd went down another path\n\nAnd the signs we must observe\n\nWhen life's changes do occur\n\nBut most of all I'll tell them\n\nJust how proud I am of them\n\nAnd always have a good time\n\nIt's all love and good times\n\nLet's all have a good time Yeah\n\n\n\nRoll on Roll on Roller Coaster\n\nWe're one day older and one step closer\n\nRoll on there's mountains to climb\n\nRoll on we're on borrowed time\n\nRoll on Roller coaster\n\nRoll on tonight\n\nRoll on tonight\n\n\n\n(R.J.
