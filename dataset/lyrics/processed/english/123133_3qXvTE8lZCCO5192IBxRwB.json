  "lyrics": "I used to wonder how it'd feel like\r\nI looked at everyone for answers\r\nChasing round and down in circles, on purpose\r\nIn search of something\r\nI spent a while trying to learn somehow\r\nSome missing pieces will not stop me\n\nI tried to fill my gaps with heartbeats, so fleeting, cold feet\n\nBeside me\n\n\n\nAnd I still don't know how I feel about it\n\nAnd I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning\n\nHow to clear my head when all I think about is you\n\nBut I'm only human\n\nI found out, I know now\n\n\n\nI still wonder how it turned out\n\nIf I done everything, but what if\n\nIf I'd live like I feel like I could've, I should've\n\nAnd I was younger\n\nBut I'm good now, I found out\n\n\n\nThat I still don't know how I feel about it\n\nAnd I still don't know but I feel like I'm learning\n\nHow to catch my breath when all I'm breathing for is you\n\n\n\nI can't keep holding down\n\nBut you can show me how\n\nIf you're only human\n\nOh, I think I found out, woah\n\nI think I know now\n\n\n\nI used to wonder what love is\n\nBut ever since you've been around\n\nI finally think I have it figured out, but I missed it\n\nI see now, I found out\n\nI know now",
