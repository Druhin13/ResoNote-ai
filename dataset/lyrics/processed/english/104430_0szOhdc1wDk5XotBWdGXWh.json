  "lyrics": "I really want to know you better, uh uh\r\nYou and me should hang together, uh uh\r\nIf I give you love don’t let up, uh uh\r\nBaby this is now or never, uh uh\r\nDark silhouettes in the morning\n\nInto the jungle\n\nJust how you wanted\n\nPlease don't ignore me\n\nYou're on fire I know it\n\nStop, drop it and roll it\n\nI came here ready for the moment\n\nOh baby you're not alone\n\nEverybody deserves some sunshine\n\nLate night dates you're never on time\n\nWhy? Why? 'Cause\n\nI never let you control me\n\nAll you needed was to hold me\n\nBeautiful, pitiful didn't you?\n\n\n\nI really want to know you better\n\nYou and me should hang together\n\nIf I give you love don’t let up\n\nBaby this is now or never\n\n\n\nNothing in life is for certain\n\nClose the curtains\n\nFollow me baby\n\nI won't desert you\n\nYou broke my heart at 21\n\nLike a blackjack uh\n\nI'm a one of one\n\nTo live and die by the gun\n\nFlights out west\n\nLife is beautiful\n\nYou shut me down\n\nBut I was bulletproof\n\nI'm so sorry if I offended you\n\nBut I, I've been seeking out the best in you\n\nIt's only right if you reciprocate\n\nEven the anonymous they illustrate\n\nI tried to love you tried to demonstrate\n\nBut still\n\n\n\nI really want to know you better\n\nYou and me should hang together\n\nIf I give you love don’t let up\n\nBaby this is now or never\n\nI really want to know you better\n\nYou and me should hang together\n\nIf I give you love don’t let up\n\nBaby this is now or never",
