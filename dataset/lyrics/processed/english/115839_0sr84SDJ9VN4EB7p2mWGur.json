  "lyrics": "You saw me drive by your place last Friday\r\nBut don't make too much of it\r\nIt's just on my way home\r\nI didn't see the picture that you posted in this bar\r\nAnd when I pulled into the parking lot\r\nI didn't see your car\n\n\n\nYou can tell your friends it's all on purpose\n\nThat I'm the crazy ex that wrecks your life\n\nBut there is no intentions underneath the surface\n\nSo don't go reading anything between the lines\n\n\n\nCause I'm over you and everything that we used to do together\n\nMy Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better\n\nI didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else\n\nAnd I'm over you\n\nThinking that every move that I'm making is just a game that I'm playing, because my heart is still breaking\n\nBoy, I'm over you, I'm over you\n\nSo get over yourself, yeah\n\nSo get over yourself\n\n\n\nYou think all I do is talk about us\n\nAnd that the new boy I show off is only out of spite\n\nYou're so in your head about it\n\nYou can't get your heart around it\n\nBut boy I'm over you\n\nI'm over you\n\n\n\nI'm over you and everything that we used to do together\n\nMy Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better\n\nI didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else\n\nAnd I'm over you\n\nThinking that every move that I'm making is just a game that I'm playing, because my heart is still breaking\n\nBoy, I'm over you, I'm over you\n\nSo get over yourself\n\n\n\nGuess what else?\n\nTo call your pictures down off of my shelf\n\nAnd I don't care enough to hate you, so I even wish you well, boy\n\n\n\nSo, you can tell your friends I do it all on purpose\n\nThat I'm the crazy ex that wrecks your life\n\n\n\nBut I'm over you and everything that we used to do together\n\nMy Saturday nights are brighter, I never felt better\n\nI didn't miss a beat when I heard you were seeing somebody else\n\nAnd I'm over you\n\nThinking that every move that I'm making is just a game that I'm playing, because my heart is still breaking\n\nBoy, I'm over you, I'm over you\n\nSo get over yourself, yeah\n\nSo get over yourself, cause I'm over you\n\nSo get over yourself",
