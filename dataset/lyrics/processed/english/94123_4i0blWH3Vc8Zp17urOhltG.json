  "lyrics": "Eyes are on your phone\r\nAt the edge of my bed with your hand on my leg\r\nWhat you smiling for?\r\nWas it something I said? Is she back already?\r\nKnow that I shouldn't get used to you\n\nI keep my composure used to being used by you\n\n\n\nI don't know wnat's worse\n\nThat you walked in my room\n\nSmelling like her perfume\n\nOr that I called you first\n\nThought that I was immune\n\nWouldn't let you get any closer\n\nI shouldn't get used to you\n\nLosing my composure\n\nYou love me being lost in you\n\n\n\nYou lie on my sheets, then lie to my face\n\nI lie through my teeth and say I'm okay\n\nWon't settle for a second place\n\nYou could say you warned me\n\nBut this time I mean it\n\nI'm so sick of these dead end feelings\n\n\n\nScrolling through my thoughts\n\nAt the edge of regret, got my hands on my head\n\nI gotta cut you off\n\nHope it hurts you like it hurt me\n\n\n\nYou're gonna have to stop getting so used to me\n\nAlways crawling back to, let you get the best of me\n\n\n\nYou lie on my sheets, then lie to my face (you lie to my face)\n\nI lie through my teeth and say I'm okay (say I'm okay)\n\nWon't settle for a second place\n\nYou could say you warned me\n\nBut this time I mean it\n\nI'm so sick of these dead end feelings\n\n\n\nMissed calls and text messages\n\nI deserve more than this\n\nNot just when I am with you\n\nWhen she is just pissed off at you\n\nAnd you tell her you're through\n\nYou'll crawl right on back\n\nIn a day or two, deja-vu\n\nI know you'll never change\n\nAnd I, I will never stay\n\n'Cause your lies they stay the same\n\nOn my own I will be okay\n\n\n\nYou lie on my sheets, then lie to my face\n\nI lie through my teeth and say I'm okay\n\nWon't settle for a second place\n\nYou could say you warned me\n\nBut fuck if you mean it\n\nI'm so sick of these dead end feelings",
