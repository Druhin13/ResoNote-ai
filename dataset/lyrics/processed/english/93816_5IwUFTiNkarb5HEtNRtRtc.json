  "lyrics": "I didn't see it coming (Coming)\r\nBut I never really had much faith\r\nIn the universe's magic (Magic), oh, no\r\nTill it pulled us to that time and place\r\nAnd I'll never forget\r\nWhen the floodgates opened, we, we cried an ocean\n\nIt still has me choking; it's hard to explain\n\nI know you know me, you don't have to show me\n\nI, I feel you're lonely, no need to explain\n\n\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, I could be punching\n\nBut I always tend to fluctuate\n\nAnd I feel sick that I'm buzzing, oh, love, I'm in trouble\n\nI'm sorry, but you got me gushing all over the place\n\nI never wanna get wet\n\nBut I think we're chosen like our fates were woven\n\nAnd all of those bad choices were left turns on the way\n\n\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue\n\n\n\nI think best way to explain, it's like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nYeah, kinda like that, but a little more (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nYeah, all makes sense right like (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nLike (Oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nLike (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\n\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue\n\nSo don't say you love me; fala, \"amo\"\n\nJust let your heart speak up, and I'll know\n\nNo amount of words could ever find a way to make sense of this\n\nSo I wanna hear your mother tongue",
