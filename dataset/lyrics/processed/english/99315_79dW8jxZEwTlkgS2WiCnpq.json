  "lyrics": "Found one of your old mixtapes\r\nRemembering listening to grace, I do\r\nBut we were driving to DC\r\nI was drunk in your backseat, I know\r\nNothing will ever be\n\nLike when were seventeen\n\nThe stars will rearrange\n\nThe sun will fade away\n\nEveryone will change\n\nBut we will still remain\n\nAnd outlast the pyramids\n\n\n\nI will feel you\n\nI will see you\n\nI will hear you\n\nAfter the silence\n\n\n\nRemember all the frilly nights\n\nDriving down our ninety-five\n\nSinging in a smokey room\n\nWhen we had everything to lose, I do\n\nAnd when we got some room to breathe\n\nYou said that you would marry me\n\nBut even if we never do\n\nI will alway be with you, I know\n\n\n\nThat nothing will ever be\n\nLike when we were twenty-three\n\nMaps will rearrange\n\nAnd blue will turn to grey\n\nEverything will change\n\nBut we will still remain\n\nAnd outlast the pyramids\n\n\n\nI will feel you\n\nI will see you\n\nI will hear you\n\nAfter the silence\n\n\n\nThe oceans can burn for all I care\n\nAnd in the ashes I'll meet you there\n\nI know someday the moon will blow away\n\nAnd all fish will decay\n\nEverything will change\n\nBut we will still remain and outlast the pyramids\n\n\n\nI will feel you\n\nI will see you\n\nI will hear you\n\nAnd I will keep you\n\nAfter the silence\n\nAfter the silence\n\nAfter the silence\n\nSilence, silence",
