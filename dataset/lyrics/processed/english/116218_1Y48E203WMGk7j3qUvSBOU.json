Go solo\n\nIf that's what we wanted why are we so low, low?\n\nOoo, nana, we got issues\n\nOoo, nana, I can't fix you\n\nBut I've been out here fighting to let go\n\nNow I'm drunk and I miss you\n\nDrunk and I miss you\n\nNow I'm drunk and I miss you\n\n\n\nDidn't think you would believe me\n\nWhen I said that I don't need it\n\nWe letting all our feelings\n\nTill we had enough\n\n'Cause you told me that I hurt you\n\nJust the way that I am hurt too\n\nAnd I wish we could reverse it\n\nTake it from the top\n\n\n\nAnd I say ooo, nananana, don't get enough\n\nOoo, lalalala, let's work it out\n\nWho can say I can't fix you?\n\nWho can say it's not worth it?\n\n\n\nIsn't alright that we go? Go solo\n\nIf that's what we wanted why are we so low, low?\n\nOoo, nana, we got issues\n\nOoo, nana, I can't fix you\n\nBut I've been out here fighting to let go\n\nNow I'm drunk and I miss you\n\nDrunk and I miss you\n\nNow I'm drunk and I miss you\n\n\n\nGet up, get in my bed\n\nGet up, come back again\n\nYou got me falling for [?]\n\nYou got me calling for rebounds\n\nGet up, get in my head\n\nGet up, come back again\n\nI don't know what I will face on\n\nThis is what love really takes on",
