  "lyrics": "I try not to overthink\r\nBut what if back is front and meet wit' money like I drove a brinks truck?\r\nYou outta luck\r\nCause what I'm jotting is career ending\r\nAtmosphere bending to whose ear lending a fear\r\nThat they'll see it appear trending\n\nOn the sites in they web browsers\n\nI've dodged bullets, demons, chicks who try to get inside of a celeb trowsers\n\nTo extort 'em, fake pregnancy, and post a picture just for likes outta bordem\n\nSometimes I think that could've been me\n\nFrom how I used to spend free time out in NC\n\nNY, LA, or trips having meetings up in capital\n\nWhich could've blew me up and have my haters ducking shrapnel, but\n\nIt wasn't meant to be\n\nI used to wonder why collapsing under my\n\nBlunders by the time that I undone a tie\n\nI had to wear while up in court when I was sued\n\nBut now I see it's not the size of your problems\n\nIt's how it's viewed, so I'm thinking\n\nYou either change the way you see things\n\nOr keep poking at a hive and wind up getting bee stings\n\nCause I was looking up to D Boys pushing C [?]\n\n[?] and three rings\n\nKeep a bank roll and drop a G-string\n\nWe sing they praises when they serving time\n\nIf it's moms who they were serving\n\nWould I think that they deserve a dime?\n\nLet me think, hell no\n\nAnd that's off the top like a elbow\n\nThat fell low from the turnbuckle\n\n\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking\n\n\n\nEverybody got flaws including me, I'll admit that\n\nI'm just a kid born in the city where the skinny n's die trying to get fat\n\nAnd sit at the round table thinking once I found a down label\n\nWe could build a foundation if the ground stable\n\nMy very first contract I signed jerked me\n\nStuck a toe inside of waters that one would define murky and I almost drowned\n\nWith bricks tied to both ankles\n\nThat's how it all goes down behind the scenes\n\nI know what you thinking how you slip up if your mind is king\n\nKnow-it-all smarty pants, they would've hemmed your designer jeans\n\nI was [?] with a dream and if it manifested\n\nThese anorexic pockets would have 100-grand investments\n\nMy pops wouldn't have to find a job again\n\nAnd maybe my aunties wouldn't be beefed out\n\nCause that's a problem when they sister gone\n\nThey know she would insist upon\n\nBuilding back up a consistent bond\n\nUntil they not existing on the planet\n\n\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking\n\n\n\nAll these thoughts inside my head keep me up at night\n\nI queue a beat, plug in my earbuds\n\nLet it bump and write something heavy, or is it something light?\n\nDo I base it on pumping white or thoughts about Trump and right\n\nWhen conservatives can talk about these haters and how payback trick is nervousness\n\nRevenge is best cold when you serve the dish with no preservatives, but\n\nMaybe this just ain't the track for that\n\nTo do the multi-syllables than acrobats\n\nI need to not get out the part\n\nCrack the backs with championship back-to-backs\n\nAnyone who's tryin' to short change me is paying active tax\n\nI'm just saying\n\nN's never want to see me win\n\nPart of the reason why I've been through these situations I'm in\n\nMaybe it's in God's plan and I've reached my fullest potential cause\n\nI've felt that I was dealt a odd hand\n\nIf I play my cards right then I could win it all, but\n\nWhat if I lose myself?\n\nEvery second that every minute fall\n\n\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking\n\nOr maybe I'm just overthinking\n\n\n\nAnd all so called civilized peoples\n\nHave increasingly become crazy and self-destructive\n\nWe confuse science, words, numbers, symbols, and ideas with the real world\n\nMost of us would have rather money than tangible wealth\n\nAnd a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed\n\nAnd to read about it the next day in the newspaper\n\nIs oddly, more fun for us than the original event",
