  "lyrics": "Back in time before they crossed the line, and the truth was made of gold\r\nCross of paths that was based on the past, or so the story goes\r\nStrike fear and the end draws near, and the peasants wore a blindfold\r\nStack 'em up, stack 'em up, burn 'em down, and the peace remains unknown\r\nBurdened by a faith\n\nLost without a trace\n\nCrippled by the tools\n\nMade by the hands of fools\n\nStart the fire\n\nAnd cast the first stone\n\n\n\n\"Teach me\", said the God to the king, \"this is all the things I see\"\n\nMean man just doesn't understand, but he does it all for me\n\nTake a stand, beat the devil's hand, you'll be dreaming on a bed of nails\n\nLast prayer in the Cecil square, choose a place that you will fail\n\n\n\n\"Forget it, the war is won\"\n\nSaid the God behind his son\n\nDesperate hold him down\n\nBeware the cross and crown\n\nStart the fire\n\nAnd cast the first stone\n\n\n\nCalm down, comes without a sound, and the peace remains unknown\n\nDon't tell you are destined to fail, but you'll be useless on your own\n\nStill refuse to fire as they run born alive and your soul becomes a stone\n\nStack 'em up, stack 'em up to atone his holy flesh and bone\n\n\n\nBurdened by a faith\n\nLost without a trace\n\nCrippled by the fools\n\nStart the fire\n\n\"Forget it, the war is won\"\n\nSaid the God behind his son\n\nDesperate hold him down\n\nBeware the cross and crown\n\nStart the fire\n\nAnd cast the first stone\n\nCast the first stone",
