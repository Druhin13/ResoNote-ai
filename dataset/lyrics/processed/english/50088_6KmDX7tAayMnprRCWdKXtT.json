  "lyrics": "Check\r\nIts been a minute since I've been with some women\r\nNot 'cause they been lacking, just I've been lacking the feelin'\r\nI've been starring at the ceiling\r\nListen to the chat that they're revealin'\r\nWondering if I open up or keep concealing\n\nI ain't try to be demeaning\n\nIt seems\n\nThought you knew dis\n\nI don't really do dis\n\nMoving like a Judas\n\nTalking all that talk\n\nBut ain't no time for acting foolish\n\nWhen you ask of all the brothers saying true dis\n\nI might just jump on this for free\n\nJumping on them freestyle\n\nI've been well\n\nMoving brain, cenile\n\nIt's sole sunsets\n\nBeautiful is one guess\n\nOne morning afternoon in that sun dress\n\nSummer flies by\n\nEvery morning, I'm still yawning\n\nSame conversation, never boring\n\n(Yo she texted you. Swear? Nah its Tomen. Ah ffs)\n\n\n\nI know that these days are feeling cold\n\nMy love could take her home\n\nAs if we never knew\n\nI was too young for you\n\n\n\nAy, And then you say you ain't about guys\n\nAy, Specially brothers from the south side\n\nBut been about mine\n\nEver since the drought now\n\nYou and me been living on this cloud nine\n\nSaying its about time\n\nStunting, front light\n\nNothing will change until it drains\n\nAin't noting the same\n\nCause you become like the blood in my veins\n\nSaying love way too young\n\nTo be stuck on the rain\n\nBut still its peak\n\nWeeks 'til I figured out you played keys\n\nEighteen, you been listening to Jay Dee\n\nBlaming the bait trees\n\nTelling me you hate these\n\nG's but didn't need me telling you they ain't me\n\nBecause they ain't me, they ain't me\n\nDon't need to know about the colours that they paint me\n\nI've been too busy getting dizzy off that J.D\n\nDreaming of the places that you could take me\n\n\n\nI know that these days are feeling cold\n\nMy love could take her home\n\nAs if we never knew\n\nI was too young for you",
