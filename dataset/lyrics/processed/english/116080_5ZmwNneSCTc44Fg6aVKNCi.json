I bet you say a demon\n\nIt's a horror story, bet I have everybody screaming\n\nThey got some OG's who been hustlin', some up in the can\n\nThey say it's a struggle, say it's hard to touch a hundred grand\n\nDevil on my back so through the day I always be praying\n\nWould you let a nigga step on your or hop out and start sprayin'?\n\nI'm on probation but I always keep that thing on me\n\nI know they hate me, I'm like fuck 'em, I ain't never runnin'\n\nWe grab them choppers and post up since they say they comin'\n\nWhen they pull up we hit 'em up, there go a whole hundred\n\nThese bitches under disguise, tryna get to my money\n\nShe think she fuckin' with my mind, won't finesse me out nothin'\n\nDiamond teeth, summer rider, king on the under\n\nI ain't have nothing but now you see me with a lot of money\n\nI'm like oh-oh-oh, when this pain gon' go?\n\nWhat you don't tell, they don't know, I'll never sell my soul\n\nI done walked a long road, was up in jail up the road\n\nStood on all ten toes, nigga I'm never fold\n\n\n\nGot to go hard 'cause I heard some niggas knocking me\n\nWatch my surroundings 'cause I heard some people watching me\n\nHustler ambition, swear to God it ain't no stopping me\n\nThey like the way I do it so I guess that's why they copy me\n\nIn the rain while it's storming, gotta make it out\n\nStack up that money, none of my niggas will see a drought\n\nThey speaking on me then you knowing I'ma see what it's 'bout\n\nTwo twenty-three up in the closet, I'ma bring it out",
