  "lyrics": "Can we stay awake\r\nAnd lay the day to waste\r\nForsake these bones\r\nHopelessly abandoning our phones\r\nTo watch the clouds awake\r\nOver the homes\n\nOf people we won't ever know (ever know)\n\n\n\nCause nothing is bigger and brighter than this\n\nYeah, I couldn't tell you that we won't exist\n\nAnd here is the last dance, trying to admit\n\nThat I should let you go\n\n\n\nLove, no feeling can last forever\n\nLove, I'm ready to let you know\n\nLove, no feeling can last forever\n\nLove, I'm ready to let you go\n\n\n\nCan we stay alight\n\nReignite these embers\n\nJust for one more night\n\nNever to grow old\n\nIf we just frame it right\n\nSo much for foresight in this\n\nLast dance, trying to admit\n\nThat I should let this go\n\n\n\nLove, no feeling can last forever\n\nLove, I'm ready to let you know\n\nLove, no feeling can last forever\n\nLove, I'm ready to let you go\n\n\n\nReady to let you know (you know)\n\nReady to let you go (you go)\n\nReady to let you go\n\n\n\nCan we stay awake\n\nCan we stay awake\n\nCan we stay awake\n\nCan we stay awake\n\n\n\nLove, no feeling can last forever (forever)\n\nLove, I'm ready to let you know (ready to let you know)\n\nLove, no feeling can last forever (ready to let you go)\n\nLove, I'm ready to let you go\n\n\n\nReady to let you go (you go)\n\nReady to let you know (you know)\n\nReady to let you go (you go)\n\nReady to let you know\n\nReady to let you go (you go)\n\nReady to let you know\n\nThis feeling won't last forever, forever",
