  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Catch 22 par Junge Junge\r\nGot days, days I wanna spend on us\nDays I don't even care that much\n\nBeen going back and forth, in and out of touch\nYou always start a fight when we're making up\nAlthough my heart wants you, my mind does not\nBut who am I to judge love? Who am I to judge us?\n\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI'm stuck in this catch 22, I'm stuck in this catch 22\n\n\nGot days, days I feel like leaving you\nAnd days when we wake up just like lovers do\n\nBeen going back and forth, in and out of touch\nYou always start a fight when we're making up\nAlthough my heart wants you, my mind does not\nBut who am I to judge love? Who am I to judge us?\n\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI'm stuck in this catch 22, I'm stuck in this catch 22\n\n\nI'm unsure to spend my days on you\nStuck on you 3,5,6,7\nWhat do I do? My catch 22\nWhat do I do? What do I do?\n\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI want ya, want ya, want ya, want ya, I do\nMy mind tells me not to, not to, not to, not to, not to\nI'm stuck in this catch 22, I'm stuck in this catch 22\n\nYeah yeah, yeah yeah",
