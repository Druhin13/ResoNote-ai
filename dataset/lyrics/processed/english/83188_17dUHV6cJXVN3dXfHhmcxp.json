  "lyrics": "Way downtown just foolin' around\rTook me to the jail\rIt's oh me and it's oh my\rNo one to go my bail\rIt was late last night when Willie came home\rI heard him a-rapping on the door\rHe's a-slipping and a-sliding with his new shoes on\rMamma said Willie don't you rap no more\rWay downtown just foolin' around\rTook me to the jail\rIt's oh me and it's oh my\rNo one to go my bail\rI wish I was over at my sweet Sally's house\rSittin' in that big armed chair\rOne arm around this old guitar\rAnd the other one around my dear\rWay down town just foolin' around\rTook me to the jail\rIt's oh me and it's oh my\rNo one to go my bail\rNow, its one old shirt is all that I got\rAnd a dollar is all that I crave\rI brought nothing with me into this old world\rAin't gonna take nothing to my grave\rWay down town just foolin' around\rTook me to the jail\rIt's oh me and it's oh my\rNo one to go my bail",
