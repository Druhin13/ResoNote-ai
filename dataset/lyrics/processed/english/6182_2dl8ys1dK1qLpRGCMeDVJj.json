  "lyrics": "In a league of his own\r\nA villain with no morals\r\nAbove the law and reckless\r\nMutating day by day\r\nInvisible and silence\r\nConspiring to get power\n\nThis man will stop at nothing\n\nTo always get his way\n\n\n\nLike a thief in the night\n\nWith the blade held tight\n\nTrapped inside the mind\n\nOf the spectre\n\n\n\nWhen you're mind in a vice\n\nHe twists and turns with terror\n\nKeeps building up the pressure\n\nUntil you're feeling numb\n\n\n\nLike a thief in the night\n\nWith the blade held tight\n\nTrapped inside the mind\n\nOf the spectre\n\n\n\nTrapped inside the mind\n\nOf the spectre\n\n\n\nThe spectre creeps behind you\n\nShrouded by his stealth\n\nIgnore him at your peril\n\nHe kills to heal himself\n\n\n\nIn the blink of an eye\n\nHe marks you with precision\n\nCorrupting all he touches\n\nSalvation in your soul\n\nScourging you in silence\n\nAs he makes his incision\n\nThe venom's taking over\n\nThis tyrant takes his toll\n\n\n\nLike a thief in the night\n\nWith the blade held tight\n\nTrapped inside the mind\n\nOf the spectre\n\nYou'll be frozen in fright\n\nLike the glint of his knife\n\nTrapped inside the mind\n\nOf the spectre",
