  "lyrics": "Can you just lie to me\r\nAnd ruin these memories\r\n'Cause I've gotta forget somehow\r\nSo I'm begging you, burn us to the ground\n\n'Cause I know it's over\n\nBut I don't know what to do\n\nSo help me get over\n\nHelp me get over you\n\n\n\nAnd tell me you love somebody else or something\n\nOr say you've been unfaithful to me\n\n'Cause I need a reason to hate you, a reason to let you go\n\nA reason to move on 'cause without one I know I won't\n\nSo tell me you love somebody else or something\n\nOr say you've been unfaithful to me\n\n\n\nWhere do we go from here\n\nDo you just disappear\n\n'Cause I don't think I can be your friend\n\nWhen it feels like the break isn't gonna mend\n\n\n\nWell I know it's over\n\nBut I don't know what to do\n\nSo help me get over\n\nHelp me get over you\n\n\n\nAnd tell me you love somebody else or something\n\nOr say you've been unfaithful to me\n\n'Cause I need a reason to hate you, a reason to let you go\n\nA reason to move on 'cause without one I know I won't\n\nSo tell me you love somebody else or something\n\nOr say you've been unfaithful to me\n\n\n\n'Cause even after all this time, I'm hoping I can change your mind\n\n'Cause hope's the only open door left to choose\n\nSo let me out for good because I know that I'm not strong enough\n\nTo stop myself from feeling things for you\n\nSo you don't give me the truth\n\n\n\nJust tell me you love somebody else or something\n\nOr say you've been unfaithful to me\n\n'Cause I need a reason to hate you, a reason to let you go\n\nA reason to move on 'cause without one I know I won't\n\nSo tell me you love somebody else or something\n\nOr say you've been unfaithful to me.",
