  "lyrics": "The preaching invisible ghost\r\nTells me what I need the most\r\nThinking it knows where to go asking to blindly follow\r\nA simple task that sounds so removed\r\nJust be happy instead of consumed\r\nTo naive to know what's right\r\nYou're too young to take your own life\r\nDon't tell me to stay alive\r\nYou don't know what it takes to survive\r\nMaybe one day I can be revived\r\nBut don't you tell me to stay alive\r\nThink about the journey ahead\r\nAs you swiftly drift off to bed\r\nWell it's not really what they said\r\nBut the ideas that you've been fed\r\nA simple task that sounds so removed\r\nJust be happy instead of consumed\r\nTo naive to know what's right\r\nYou're too young to take your own life\r\nDon't tell me to stay alive\r\nYou don't know what it takes to survive\r\nMaybe one day I can be revived\r\nBut don't you tell me to stay alive\r\nA fragile mind coping with a steady unwind\r\nPeople twice your age sentenced to a faulty design\r\nBut try to understand permanence\r\nThe nemesis of time\r\nJust try to stay alive\r\nLinger on instead\r\n(I can't do this alone)\r\nA broken record plays in your head\r\nMindsets must be taught\r\nTo void original thought\r\nDon't write me off cause my vacancy is a blank canvas\r\nI can't handle this\r\nI can't understand the weight of my choices\r\nMy innosense is a blessing and a curse\r\nTo naive to know what's right\r\nYou're too young to say goodbye\r\nDon't tell me to stay alive\r\nYou don't know what it takes to survive\r\nMaybe one day I can be revived\r\nBut don't you tell me to stay alive\r\nAnd try\r\nAnd try\r\nAnd try\r\nAnd die\r\nAnd try to stay alive",
