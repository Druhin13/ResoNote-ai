In the evenings when I see them\n\nI tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving\n\nNeed something new to believe in\n\n’Cause these new niggas'll change on you, I mean they change on you\n\nWhy the hell the BBC only writes about me\n\nWhen it comes down to controversy?\n\nWhat about three CDs in one year with no label\n\nAnd we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable\n\nI was a nigga in a room with no motherfuckin' cable and no table\n\nNow my mom call me whenever she needs her car note\n\nCellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers\n\nYou understand why I do what I do, so let me do it\n\nGet the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it\n\n\n\nI don't speak like I used to\n\nI'm thinking of a way to change the world that I move through\n\nI feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I'm true to\n\nI feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through\n\nI know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you\n\nI started feelin’ restless nights, I’m scared that I'm delusional\n\nI’m scared that I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to\n\nI'm scared of what can happen when ideas would consume you ’Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve\n\n\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nI keep tellin' you\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\n\n\nStay off, get buff, get out, hey boy\n\nStay off, get buff, get out\n\nThe monsters swarm around with them toys\n\nThe monsters swarm around with them toys\n\nHey boy, stay off, get buff, get out\n\nHey boy, stay off, get buff, get out\n\nThe monsters swarm around with them toys\n\nThe monsters swarm around with them toys\n\n\n\nDon't mind me I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)\n\nBut if you got a lifeline, throw it, throw it\n\nDon't mind me I'm just killin' time (you can pick me to pieces)\n\nBut if you got a lifeline, throw it, throw it\n\n\n\nWhy the fuck would you share this shit with these people\n\nI don't know these people\n\nI don't know you either no more\n\nI'm at war with myself\n\nEvery time I see this shit I wanna kill myself\n\nAnd they coming for my mother sending bullets for my head\n\nAnd they foolin' me nah but I'd rather be dead\n\nJust leave me alone, I don't wanna be read\n\nYeah ah\n\n\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nI keep tellin' you\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nI keep tellin' you\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nI keep tellin' you\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\nI keep tellin' you\n\nYou don't understand why I can't get up and shout\n\n\n\nIt's the best years of our lives, motherfucker\n\nI feel you",
