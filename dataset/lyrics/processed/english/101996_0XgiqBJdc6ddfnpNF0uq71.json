  "lyrics": "Not to touch the earth\r\nNot to see the sun\r\nNothing left to do, but\r\nRun, run, run\r\nLet's run\r\nLet's run\n\n\n\nHouse upon the hill\n\nMoon is lying still\n\nShadows of the trees\n\nWitnessing the wild breeze\n\nC'mon baby run with me\n\nLet's run\n\n\n\nRun with me\n\nRun with me\n\nRun with me\n\nLet's run\n\n\n\nThe mansion is warm, at the top of the hill\n\nRich are the rooms and the comforts there\n\nRed are the arms of luxuriant chairs\n\nAnd you won't know a thing till you get inside\n\n\n\nDead president's corpse in the driver's car\n\nThe engine runs on glue and tar\n\nCome on along, not goin' very far\n\nTo the East to meet the Czar\n\n\n\nRun with me\n\nRun with me\n\nRun with me\n\nLet's run\n\n\n\nWhoa!\n\n\n\nSome outlaws lived by the side of a lake\n\nThe minister's daughter's in love with the snake\n\nWho lives in a well by the side of the road\n\nWake up, girl, we're almost home\n\n\n\nYa, c'mon!\n\n\n\nWe should see the gates by mornin'\n\nWe should be inside the evenin'\n\n\n\nSun, sun, sun\n\nBurn, burn, burn\n\nSoon, soon, soon\n\nMoon, moon, moon\n\nI will get you\n\nSoon!\n\nSoon!\n\nSoon!\n\n\n\nI am the Lizard King\n\nI can do anything",
