  "lyrics": "Well I got me a distant story\r\nSo I wrote me a distant tune\r\nOf how they used to bask in the glory\r\nAnd how I wished that I could too\r\nLittle man, be here tomorrow\r\nThey said they could change my ways\n\nBut instead they tried to stone me\n\nAnd I been sleeping right here for a hundred days\n\n\n\nLying, giving in\n\nTrying to get my day on through\n\nLow town, going down\n\nAin't got nobody to save me\n\n\n\nNow you know it's hard to stop\n\nGetting down from burning up\n\nNow you know it's hard to stop\n\nQuit trying, baby\n\nJust get somebody to save you\n\n\n\nSo I ran from here to El Paso\n\nAnd arrived about half past June\n\nJust in time for them to burn me\n\nI think I woke up a little too soon\n\nLittle man, if you're a preacher\n\nOh then why you been looking so sad?\n\nHe struck a match and then he burned me\n\nAnother honest man gone bad\n\n\n\nLying, giving in\n\nTrying to get my day on through\n\nLow town, going down\n\nAin't got nobody to save me\n\n\n\nNow you know it's hard to stop\n\nGetting down from burning up\n\nNow you know it's hard to stop\n\nQuit trying, baby\n\nJust get somebody to save you\n\n\n\nNow you know it's hard to stop\n\nGetting down from burning up\n\nNow you know it's hard to stop\n\nQuit trying, baby\n\nJust get somebody to",
