  "lyrics": "Surviving the life\r\nGot some highs, got some lows\r\nBut the wise man,\r\nHe knows what it's really about\r\nWhen you're doin' without\r\nSurviving the life\n\n\n\nProviding the soul,\n\nIt ain't easy to do\n\nWhen you got to get through\n\nAny way that you can\n\nJoin the family of man\n\nProviding the soul\n\n\n\nPass the plate that serves it\n\nEvery heart deserves it\n\nYou and me, we do\n\n\n\nLife ain't easy, but it ain't that bad\n\nSing the song that tells it,\n\nPraise the man that sells it\n\nYou're alive,\n\nYou might as well be glad\n\n\n\nRevealing the heart,\n\nYou know that some people try\n\nBut it's hard to get by\n\nWithout giving a thing\n\nYou only get what you bring,\n\nRevealing the heart\n\n\n\nPass the plate that serves it,\n\nEvery heart deserves it\n\nYou and me, we do\n\nLife ain't easy, but it ain't that bad\n\n\n\nSing the song that tells it\n\nPraise the man that sells it\n\nYou're alive, you might as well be glad\n\n\n\nProviding the soul,\n\nRevealing the heart,\n\nSurviving the life",
