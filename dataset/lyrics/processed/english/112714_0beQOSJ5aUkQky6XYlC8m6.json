  "lyrics": "In the beginning you were a stranger\r\nBut my outlines were drawn to the danger\r\nAnd once I had taste of your flavour\r\nMhm, closer\r\nSo I'm keeping my eyes off you\r\nWhen she put her hands on you\n\nBut later that night we do it again\n\nI'm keeping my mind off you\n\nWhen she got her body on you\n\nBut later that night we do it again\n\n\n\nCloser, pulling me closer\n\nCloser, I want you closer\n\nTell her, tell her that it's over\n\nNow we're closer\n\nCloser\n\n\n\nI think we both know that you should tell her\n\nKiss of my perfume is still on your sweater\n\nThis is the last time\n\nIt's for the better\n\nMhm, closer\n\nWalking that door\n\nWhen every part of me is reaching for you\n\nWith no apology\n\nI know everybody hurts\n\nBut this base makes it worse\n\nWhat can I do to have you again?\n\n\n\nCloser, pulling me closer\n\nCloser, I want you closer\n\nTell her, tell her that it's over\n\nNow we're closer\n\nCloser\n\n\n\nSo I'm keeping my eyes off you\n\nWhen she put her hands on you\n\nBut later that night we do it again\n\nI'm keeping my mind off you\n\nWhen she got her body on you\n\nBut later that night we do it again\n\n\n\nCloser, pulling me closer\n\nCloser, pulling me closer\n\nCloser, I want you closer\n\nTell her, tell her that it's over\n\nNow we're closer\n\nCloser\n\n\n\nTell her, tell her that it's over\n\nNow we're closer\n\nCloser",
