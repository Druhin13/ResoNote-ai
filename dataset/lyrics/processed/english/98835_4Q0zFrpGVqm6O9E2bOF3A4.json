  "lyrics": "There you have it, the beginning and the end\r\nThe intern's shovel still covered in shit\r\nDeath, indiscriminate drags off the newborn buck with the broken leg\r\nIn the shadow of conversations had while I was asleep\r\nNot to mention the years of conversations you've had without me\n\n\n\nAfternoon vanilla sun crawls away across the lawn\n\nThrough the phone I pull you and drag your voice around\n\nAfternoon vanilla sun crawls away without a sound\n\nThrough the phone I pull you and drag your voice around\n\n\n\nYou don't know I know what's wrong\n\n\n\nNotification: 8 executions by drug to beat the expiration\n\nA shelf life of reason, is that what this was Arkansas?\n\nSomewhere a judge stretches himself out on fine tropical sand\n\nI went back to work then took the train home\n\nI saw a fire in the distance\n\n\n\nAfternoon vanilla sun crawls away across the lawn\n\nThrough the phone I pull you and drag your voice around\n\nAfternoon vanilla sun crawls away without a sound\n\nThrough the phone I pull you and drag your voice around\n\n\n\nI don't know why I'm so mean each time I come to visit\n\nI don't know why I'm so mean each time I come around",
