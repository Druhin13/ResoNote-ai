  "lyrics": "When I first saw you on the union square you were waist deep in a bag of your books and your hell. The look on your face said, “Someone please save me!” I was just there to take in the air. And all of this time, well, I’ve lost my head in Eau Claire. The first night I spent at your house you were such a delight. Your voice never raised up once except for at your dog. When everyone left and it was just me, I found my place, I felt at ease. And all of this time, I’ve still lost my head in Eau Claire. So pour the champagne, pour the champagne for the lost lovers. I’ve lost my head in Eau Claire",
