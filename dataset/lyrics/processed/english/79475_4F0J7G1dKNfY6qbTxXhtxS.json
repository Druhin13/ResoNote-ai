  "lyrics": "Find another girl like her\r\nI dare you to\r\nShe deserves a man to love her still\r\nHer father left her empty with a dream to find a real man who will\r\n'Cause she don't want to be alone\n\nHer mother says to run and never turn around\n\nNever make the same mistakes we did\n\nHere's your chance to start again\n\nTo wash away the dirt you learned as kids\n\nShe don't want to be alone\n\n\n\nShe don't like the way she looks in the mirror\n\nI don't like the way she looks in the mirror every chance that she gets\n\nShe's as good as it gets\n\nHave no fear my dear\n\nYou will never be alone\n\n\n\nDon't believe the things your exes say to you\n\nThey're still looking for the reason of life\n\nThey tossed you to the curb and made a mockery of a perfectly good wife\n\n'Cause they don't want to be alone\n\n\n\nYou don't like the way you look in the mirror\n\nI don't like the way you look in the mirror every chance that you get\n\nYou're as good as it gets\n\nHave no fear my dear\n\nYou will never be alone\n\n\n\nSo take it slow, my dear\n\nYou'll never know my dear\n\nSecond chances come around\n\nI promise you to trust me-- never fear\n\n\n\nYou don't like the way you look in the mirror\n\nI don't like the way you look in the mirror every chance that you get\n\nYou're as good as it gets\n\nHave no fear my dear\n\nYou will never be alone\n\nYou will never be alone",
