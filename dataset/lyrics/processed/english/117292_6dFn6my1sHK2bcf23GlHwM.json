We can make a lot of money\n\nBuy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly\n\nI was yea high and muddy\n\nLookin' for what was lookin' for me\n\n\n\nBut I don't need to lie no more\n\nNowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind\n\nAnd she don't cry no more\n\nShe tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...\n\nI ain't askin' \"Why?\" no more\n\nOh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines\n\nIt ain't 2009 no more\n\nYeah, I know what's behind that door\n\n\n\nYeah they ask me what I'm smilin' for\n\nWell, because I've never been this high before\n\nIt's like I never felt alive before\n\nMhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind and water\n\nSee me and you, we ain't that different\n\nI struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'\n\nTake my time to finish, mind my business\n\nA life ain't a life until you live it\n\nI was diggin' me a hole big enough to bury my soul\n\nWeight of the world, I gotta carry my own\n\nMy own, with these songs I can carry you home\n\nI'm right here when you're scared and alone\n\nAnd I ain't ever in a hurry\n\nYou don't never gotta worry\n\nEven when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low\n\nWhen your heart get cold\n\nSee what's behind all them unturned stones\n\nAnd I'm a pro when it comes to my job\n\nBut really I'm just tryna start believin' in God\n\nNow when it gets hard\n\nI don't panic, I don't sound the alarm\n\n\n\nBecause I don't need to lie no more\n\nNowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind\n\nAnd she don't cry no more\n\nShe tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...\n\nI ain't askin' \"Why?\" no more\n\nOh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines\n\nIt ain't 2009 no more\n\nYeah, I know what's behind that door\n\nI don't need to lie no more\n\nNowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind\n\nAnd she don't cry no more\n\nShe tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and...\n\nI ain't askin' \"Why?\" no more\n\nOh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines\n\nIt ain't 2009 no more\n\nYeah, I know what's behind that door",
