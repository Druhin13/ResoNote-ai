  "lyrics": "I heard somebody knocking at the door\r\nAnd I had a drink in hand\r\nBut I was looking for something more\r\nWhen I put my eyes on you, I fell in love with you\r\nFor the last time\r\nI remember the dark brown of your eyes\n\nAnd your olive skin and the look of sin\n\nYeah, you took me by surprise\n\nWhen I put my hands on you\n\nI fell in love with you\n\nFor the last time\n\n\n\nBecause the brighter that we shine\n\nLeaves a bigger shadow in our wake\n\nA story we can tell another time\n\nBut if this was love and I was wrong\n\nThen I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine\n\nWere always mine\n\n\n\nI told you to go left, then I went right\n\nThough I told you that I loved you, you couldn't tell I was lying\n\n'Cause I put a spell on you\n\nWhen I put my eyes on you\n\nFor the last time\n\nAnd maybe I'm too young to settle down (Oh-oo)\n\n'Cause I know that you'd be good for me\n\nBut that I wouldn't stick around\n\nAnd I don't wanna hurt you darling\n\nI don't want to let you down again\n\nFor the last time\n\n\n\nBecause the brighter that we shine\n\nLeaves a bigger shadow in our wake\n\nA story we can tell another time\n\nBut if this was love and I was wrong\n\nThen I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine\n\n\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nPlease don't fly home\n\nWon't you stay?\n\n\n\nBecause the brighter that we shine\n\nLeaves a bigger shadow in our wake\n\nA story we can tell another time\n\nBut if this was love and I was wrong\n\nThen I'll admit the mistakes we made were always mine\n\nWere always mine",
