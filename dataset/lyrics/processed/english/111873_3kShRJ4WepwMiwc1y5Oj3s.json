  "lyrics": "One drink too much, we're drunk\r\nWe talk about the things we shouldn't say\r\nOne step too close, alone\r\nEmotions take control, I shouldn't stay\r\nI thought that this would be easy\r\nMy body didn't believe me\n\nDeeper the ocean beneath me\n\nI feel you holding on 'cause\n\n\n\nI know that we're not supposed to\n\nDo what we're so close to\n\nCloser every night\n\nNa-ah, I changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\n\n\nAcross the room, I pull in close\n\nToo close, almost all over you\n\nIt's magnetic, the way we feel\n\nAre still like when, like when we moved\n\n\n\nI know that we're not supposed to\n\nDo what we're so close to\n\nCloser every night\n\nNa-ah, I changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\n\n\nHow did I let it go so far, go so far, go so far?\n\nHow did I let it go so far, go so far?\n\n\n\nI know that we're not supposed to\n\nDo what we're so close to\n\nCloser every night\n\nNa-ah, I changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\n\n\nBut I changed my mind",
