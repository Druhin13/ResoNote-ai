  "lyrics": "Tell me it's the best for us\r\nStake away the truth because \nSleeping top to toe with me\r\nIsn't what it used to be\r\nSo I'm changing all my days to make your night\r\nIt's just not right \n\nAnd you tell me I'm a child And take my light \n\nTo smoke your mind \n\n\n\nBut I don't smile like before\n\nAnd you take him to your bed It's all been said\n\nYou need this more\n\n\n\nTell me I'm a time you'll miss\n\nFeelings always change like this\n\nBut you are all the words I need To explain myself It seems \n\n\n\nSo I'm changing all my days \n\nTo make your night\n\nIt's just not right\n\nAnd you tell me I'm a child And take my light To smoke your mind \n\nBut I don't smile like before\n\nAnd you take him to your bed It's all been said You need this more\n\n\n\nPlease don't go I need you \"Take control\", you tell me\n\nPlease don't go I need you \"Take control\" So I'm changing all my days to make your night\n\nIt's just not right\n\nAnd you tell me I'm a child And take my light\n\nTo smoke your mind\n\nBut I don't smile like before\n\nAnd you take him to your bed\n\nIt's all been said You need this more\n\nWon't you take me to your bed I should have said \"I need you more\"",
