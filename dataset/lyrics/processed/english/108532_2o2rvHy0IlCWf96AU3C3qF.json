  "lyrics": "First time back on the westside, something's different\r\nThe vibe's on for these purple lights make me feel things I\r\nUsually don't, make me do things I usually won't\r\nI'm on one, and it's two AM, babe, just in time\r\nI don't wanna lose control\n\nCouple drinks in, can't hit that roll\n\nThen she don't drive stakes, so we goin' real slow\n\nI don't really know where this will go\n\n\n\nSo, won't you say something, say something, say something?\n\nDon't just keep on sayin' nothing, say something now\n\nSo, won't you say something, say something?\n\nI'm not the only one wanting something\n\nSay something, say something now\n\nSay something\n\n\n\nSay somethin' before I fall in love\n\nThis is where I live, guess we pullin' over\n\nTurn right at the sign, parkin' in my spot\n\nHead up to the roof, look up at the stars\n\nNow we way above it, god went too high and I love it\n\nI cannot do this in public\n\nPlease do not hit me with judgements, judges\n\n\n\nI don't wanna lose control\n\nEarly in the morning, wanna hit that roll\n\nYou want me to stop you while you goin' real slow\n\nI don't really know where this will go\n\n\n\nSo, why am I say something, say something, say something?\n\nDon't just keep on sayin' nothing, say something now\n\nSo, won't you say something, say something?\n\nI'm not the only one wanting something\n\nSay something, say something now\n\nSay something\n\n\n\nI cannot read minds; will I see you at another time?\n\nWill I see you at another time? What have we started?\n\n\n\nSo, won't you say something, say something, say something?\n\nDon't just keep on sayin' nothing, say something now\n\nSo, won't you say something, say something?\n\nI'm not the only one wanting something\n\nSay something, say something now\n\nSay something",
