  "lyrics": "I really can't stay\r\nBut baby it's cold outside\r\nI got to go away\r\nBut baby it's cold outside\r\nThis evening has been\r\nBeen hoping that you'd drop in\n\nSo very nice\n\nI'll hold your hands, they're just like ice\n\nMy mother will start to worry\n\nBeautiful, what's your hurry?\n\nMy father will be pacing the floor\n\nListen to the fireplace roar\n\nSo really, I'd better scurry\n\nBeautiful, please don't hurry\n\nBut maybe just a half a drink more\n\nI'll put some records on while I pour\n\nThe neighbours might think\n\nBaby, it's bad out there\n\nSay, what's in this drink?\n\nNo cabs to be had out there\n\nI wish I knew how\n\nYour eyes are like starlight tonight\n\nTo break this spell\n\nI'll take your hat, your hair looks swell\n\nI ought to say, no, no, no sir\n\nOh, mind if I move in closer?\n\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried\n\nWhat's the sense in hurting my pride?\n\nI really can't stay\n\nBut baby, don't hold out\n\nBut baby it's cold outside!\n\n\n\nI simply must go\n\nBut baby, it's cold outside\n\nThe answer is no, no, no\n\nAw baby, it's cold outside\n\nYour welcome has been\n\nHow lucky that you dropped in\n\nSo nice and warm\n\nLook out the window at that storm\n\nMy sister will be suspicious\n\nUm gosh, your lips are delicious\n\nAnd my brother will be there at the door\n\nWaves on a tropical shore\n\nMy maiden aunt's mind is vicious\n\nOh gosh, your lips are so delicious\n\nBut maybe just a cigarette more\n\nOh never such a blizzard before\n\nI've got to get home\n\nBut baby, you'll freeze out there\n\nSay lend me your coat\n\nOh up to your knees out there\n\nYou've really been grand\n\nI thrill when you touch my hand\n\nBut you don't see, no, no\n\nHow can you do this thing to me?\n\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow\n\nThink of my life long sorrow\n\nAt least there will be plenty implied\n\nIf you cought pneumonia and died\n\nBut I really can't stay\n\nGet over that whole doubt\n\nBut baby it's cold outside!",
