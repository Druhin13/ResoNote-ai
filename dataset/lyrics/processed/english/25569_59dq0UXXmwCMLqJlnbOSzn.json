  "lyrics": "She living in this lie with him\r\nNo more coffee in the morning\r\nI'm wide awake while he sleeping in\r\nKnow that's why you're calling\r\nYou woke up chasing feelings, healing, trouble dealing\n\nCoping with the fact that you're alone\n\nMakes you miss my body, touching, kissing, squeezing\n\nHe don't know you're worth your weight in gold\n\n\n\nLook at you falling\n\nDo you even know what you're falling for?\n\nCause I see you falling\n\nYou traded my heart for some fool's gold\n\n\n\nFools Gold\n\n\n\nCan't think about your nights with him\n\nWearing nothing but the moonlight\n\nWhen you feel your conscience stepping in\n\nMove it to my house, what?\n\n\n\nI don't need this pressure, you're my greatest treasure\n\nPanties on my bed, where'd they come from?\n\nShow up uninvited, fucking up my vibes with\n\nAll the shit that you pretend you want\n\n\n\nLook at you falling\n\nDo you even know what you're falling for?\n\nCause I see you falling\n\nYou traded my heart for some fool's gold\n\n\n\nFools Gold\n\n\n\nFools gold\n\nFools gold\n\nFools gold\n\nFools gold\n\n\n\nLook at you falling\n\nDo you even know what you're falling for?\n\nCause I see you falling\n\nYou traded my heart for some fool's gold\n\n\n\nLook at you falling\n\nDo you even know what you're falling for?\n\nCause I see you falling\n\nYou traded my heart for some fool's gold\n\n\n\nFools Gold",
