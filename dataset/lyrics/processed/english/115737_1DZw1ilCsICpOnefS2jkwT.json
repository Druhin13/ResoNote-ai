  "lyrics": "Wanna know where I don’t go\r\nWhen it goes from OK to a oh no\r\nWhen it goes from hi five to a low blow\r\nWhen it goes from all five to a solo\r\nLemme tell you what you don’t know\r\nI been down / so low / I was\n\nLooking for something but denying that I found it\n\nThere’s an elephant sitting in the room\n\nAnd I can’t find another way to tiptoe around it\n\nI been doing greater good for a long time\n\nBut I can’t find any other way to give now\n\nI been putting myself on the sideline\n\nAnd it’s been time so I’m saying can I live now\n\n\n\nThere are times when I kick myself\n\nSay I’m not sick but I can’t get well\n\nSay I got this while I chase my tail\n\nAs if they can’t tell\n\n\n\nI'm running from my shadow\n\nRunning from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down\n\nI’ll never win the battle\n\nNever win the battle and I should have known it by now\n\nJust when I think I’ve found the end / ohhh\n\nI’m going back around again / ohhh\n\nRunning from my shadow\n\nRunning from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down\n\n\n\nLight side’s got a dark side to it\n\nDaytime flows into night like fluid\n\nThe yin and the yang with a curved line through it\n\nAnd none of it’s illuminating why I do it\n\nMaybe I didn’t want to chase what was not right\n\nMaybe I didn’t want to face you were offsides\n\nThinking I was far away from a crossed line\n\nBut I was giving soft praise to a hard lie\n\nThere are things that you say and you don’t say\n\nMy tongue’s gotten real tired of me biting it\n\n‘Cause I keep on following the wrong way\n\nTime’s come and I can’t keep denying it\n\nThere are times when I kick myself\n\nSay I’m not sick but I can’t get well\n\nSay I got this while I chase my tail\n\nAs if they can’t tell\n\n\n\nI'm running from my shadow\n\nRunning from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down\n\nI’ll never win the battle\n\nNever win the battle and I should have known it by now\n\nJust when I think I’ve found the end / ohhh\n\nI’m going back around again / ohhh\n\nRunning from my shadow\n\nRunning from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down\n\n\n\n(grandson)\n\nI love you but I know / I gotta let you go\n\nDancing with the devil cause she’s all I’ve ever known\n\nWanted to pretend / That this time was the end\n\nSorry but I guess I gotta let you down again\n\nAgain\n\nAgain\n\nRunning from my shadow now my shadow is my only friend\n\n\n\nRunning from my shadow\n\nBut it’s still there chasing me down\n\nRunning from my shadow\n\nRunning from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down",
