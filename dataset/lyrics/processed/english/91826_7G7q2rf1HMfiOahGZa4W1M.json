  "lyrics": "Here we are \nStuck by this river, \nYou and I \nUnderneath a sky that's ever falling down, down, down \nEver falling down.\n\nThrough the day \n\nAs if on an ocean \n\nWaiting here, \n\nAlways failing to remember why we came, came, came\n\nI wonder why we came. \n\n\n\nYou talk to me \n\nas if from a distance \n\nAnd I reply \n\nWith impressions chosen from another time, time, time, \n\nFrom another time.",
