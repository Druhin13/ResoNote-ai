  "lyrics": "Saw you standing on the corner\r\nFlashing that plastic smile\r\nLiving out in California\r\nDrove a couple thousand miles\r\nBet you never left a goodbye note\r\nDidn’t know what to say\n\nBet you thought you had it all figured out\n\nSomehow you lost your way\n\n\n\nCome back in from the cold\n\nYou’re playing the game but you’re losing your soul\n\nYou’re moving too fast now you’re out control\n\nYou don’t need the glitter you’re already gol\n\n\n\nCome back in from the cold\n\nYou’re living “the life” but you’re playing a role\n\nOoooooowhoa don’t act like nobody told ya!\n\nYou’re already gold\n\n\n\nYou’re trying to get your head right\n\nNever been so hard for you\n\nCuz you’re all up in the headlines\n\nFor every little thing you do\n\nYou’ve probably burned a bridge or two\n\nChasing down those dreams\n\nYou’ll probably find out the hard way\n\nIt’s not all what it seems",
