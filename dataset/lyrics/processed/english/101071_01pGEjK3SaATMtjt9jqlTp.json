  "lyrics": "Some folks' lives roll easy as a breeze\rDrifting through a summer night\rHeading for a sunny day\rBut most folks' lives, oh they stumble\rLord they fall\rThrough no fault of their own\rMost folks never catch their stars\rAnd here I am, lord\rI'm knocking at your place of business\rI know I ain't got no business here\rBut you said if I ever got so low\rI was busted,\rYou could be trusted\rSome folks' lives roll easy\rSome folks' lives\rNever roll at all\rOh, they just fall\rThey just fall\rSome folks' lives",
