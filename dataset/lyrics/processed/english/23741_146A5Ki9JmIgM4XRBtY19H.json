  "lyrics": "Just a stray little Gypsy boy, trying on the highway for size\r\nA cowboy kid cracking 105, crossing the New Mexico line\r\n(I believe) I believe we got a live one here, (hey hey) no inhibitions no fear\r\nChorus:\n\nHey you wanna play your hand\n\nOr are you just playing for the girls in the grandstand\n\nDon't you wanna roll them bones\n\nAre you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone\n\n\n\nTag along with my little vagabond, as long as you got something to burn\n\nWe'll slide on over to old Antone's\n\nThere's a little game I think you should learn\n\n\n\n(Hey hey) There's a big shot of the owner hanging over the bar\n\n(Hey hey) Shaking hands with some rock and roll star\n\n\n\nchorus\n\n\n\nWell I'm glad I let you find me boy, I been waitin' for you\n\nWon't you be my brand new pride and joy\n\nI've been savin' up all my good luck until tonight\n\n\n\n(Solo)\n\n\n\nOn a roll he was on top of the world\n\nTill he laid it all on seven and nine\n\nLost his shirt and his keys to the highway\n\nLooks like I'll be driving tonight\n\n\n\n(Hey hey) Ten to one we'll take the long way home\n\n(Hey hey) We've got ignition, so let's go\n\n\n\nchorus repeats 2x\n\n\n\nAre you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone\n\nAre you a tumbleweed or a rolling stone...",
