  "lyrics": "Awake\r\nThis song has found you\r\nAsleep at the wheel of your car\r\nYou’re boring; bored; unengaged\r\nLife comes to rattle your cage\n\nYou can do better than that\n\nHit me again and give it some impact\n\nYou can do better than that\n\nHit me again and show me where I crack\n\n\n\nThis naked ape\n\nSo out of shape\n\nSedated by hi-tech\n\nWants fame on a plate\n\nThough water flows round rocks\n\nIts path don’t deviate\n\n\n\nYou can do better than that\n\nHit me again and give it some impact\n\nYou can do better than that\n\nHit me again and show me where I crack\n\nYou can do better than that\n\n\n\nYou’re coming out of your way\n\nLive like today's your last day\n\n\n\nYou can do better than that\n\nHit me again and give it some impact\n\nYou can do better than that\n\nHit me again and show me where I crack\n\nYou can do better than that",
