  "lyrics": "I was the last to know I'm alive\r\nWoke up and bathed in the light\r\nLying on the cars on the freeway\r\nPlaying my guitar for this girl\r\nI don’t have to love or trust no one\r\nI don’t have to fight to be someone\n\nI got all the money, time, and soul I’ll ever need\n\n\n\nI was feeling so on top of the world as it came to an end\n\nSaw a rainbow with the footage showed me all the colors again\n\nI was feeling so above it\n\nBreathing like a brand new man\n\nDancing on top of the world till I’m the only one left\n\nI was the last to know I'm alive\n\nWoke up and bathed in the light\n\nI don’t have to love or trust no one\n\nI don’t have to fight to be someone\n\nI got all the money, time, and soul I’ll ever need\n\n\n\nI was feeling so on top of the world as it came to an end\n\nSaw a rainbow with the footage showed me all the colors again\n\nI was feeling so above it\n\nBreathing like a brand new man\n\nDancing on top of the world till I’m the only one left",
