  "lyrics": "You’re a constant underachiever\r\nAnd you never do anything right\r\nAnother day without making any dollar man\r\nTrying to concentrate with a cigarette in my hand, yeah\r\nSinging where did i go wrong yeah, where did I go?\n\nSeeing these teenage millionaires up on the telly box\n\nI’m only 23 but I feel like I’ve already lost\n\nSinging where did I go wrong yeah, where did I go?\n\n\n\nI’m confused, and for the first time in my life\n\nI don’t know what to do\n\nI feel used and abused\n\nAnd I guess it’s something I subconsciously knew\n\n\n\nI used to dream about something incredible\n\nNow I just settle with doing something credible, yeah\n\nWhere did I go wrong yeah, where did I go?\n\nI feel like my best days are certainly behind me\n\nOnly thing I have to look forward to is the nicotine, yeah\n\nWhere did I go wrong yeah, where did I go?\n\n\n\nAnd the diagnosis, millennial madness\n\nI'm sorry buy you've got, millennial madness\n\n\n\nRed light, amber light, green light go\n\nWhy do I finish last even when I race on my own?\n\n\n\nWhere did I go?",
