Rock on! \n\n\n\nDrive me crazier, no serenade \n\nNo fire brigade, just Pyromania \n\n\n\nWhat do you want? What do you want? \n\nI want rock'n'roll, yes I do \n\nLong live rock'n'roll \n\n\n\nOh let's go, let's strike a light \n\nWe're gonna blow like dynamite \n\nI don't care if it takes all night \n\nGonna set this town alight \n\n\n\nWhat do you want? What do you want? \n\nI want rock'n'roll, Allright! \n\nLong live rock'n'roll \n\n\n\nRock of ages, rock of ages \n\nStill rollin', keep a-rollin' \n\nRock of ages, rock of ages \n\nStill rollin', rock'n'rollin' \n\n\n\nWe got the power, got the glory \n\nJust say you need it and if you need it \n\nSay yeah! \n\n\n\nHeh heh heh heh \n\nNow listen to me \n\nI'm Burnin', Burnin', I got the fever \n\nI know for sure, there ain't no cure \n\nSo feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow \n\nGimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road \n\n\n\nWhat do you want? What do you want? \n\nI want rock'n'roll, You betcha \n\nLong live rock'n'roll \n\n\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\nWe're gonna burn this damn place down \n\nDown to the ground \n\n\n\nHeh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh",
