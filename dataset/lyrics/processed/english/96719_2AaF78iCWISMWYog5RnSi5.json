  "lyrics": "Everyday I wake and everything is broken\r\nTurning off my phone just to get out of bed\r\nGet home every evening and history's repeating\r\nTurning off my phone 'cause it's hurting my chest\r\nHey-hey\n\nAnd Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah\n\nBut what can I do?\n\nI can't see the use of me crying\n\nIf I'm not even tryna to make the change\n\nI wanna see\n\n\n\nI can't sit and hope\n\nI can't just sit and pray that\n\nI can find a love when all I see is pain\n\nI'm falling to my knees\n\nAnd though I do believe\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\nWo-oah-oah-oah-oah, oh-oh-oh\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\n\n\nAll I hear is voices, everybody's talking\n\nNothing real is happening\n\n'Cause nothing is new\n\nNow in all this tragic, and I just feel sedated\n\nWhy do I feel numb?\n\nIs that all I can do? Yeah\n\n\n\nAnd Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah\n\nBut I'm only human\n\nI can't see the use of me crying\n\nIf I'm not even tryna to make the change\n\nI wanna see\n\n\n\nI can't sit and hope\n\nI can't just sit and pray that\n\nI can find a love when all I see is pain\n\nI'm falling to my knees\n\nAnd though I do believe\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\nWo-oah-oah-oah-oah, oh-oh-oh\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\n\n\nAnd Heaven knows I'm not helpless\n\nBut what can I do? Yeah\n\nI can't see the use of me crying\n\nIf I'm not even tryna to make the change\n\nI wanna see\n\n\n\nI can't sit and hope\n\nI can't just sit and pray that\n\nI can find a love when all I see is pain\n\nI try to do the things that save it, I believe (I do believe)\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\nWo-oah-oah-oah-oah, oh-oh-oh\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\nWo-oah-oah-oah-oah, oh-oh-oh\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach\n\n\n\nI'm falling to my knees\n\nAnd though I do believe\n\nI can just preach, baby, preach",
