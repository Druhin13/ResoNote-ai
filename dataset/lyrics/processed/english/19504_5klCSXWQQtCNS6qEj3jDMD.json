  "lyrics": "Countless years ago while lost in barren seas\r\nThere whispered murmurs of a bloody mutiny\r\nWe took up arms and slain the officers of rank\r\nAnd with swords drawn made the captain walk the plank\r\nAnd as he fell down to the depths\n\nHe swore a deadly curse\n\n\"As sure as hell's my final fate\n\nYou'll all soon die, or worse\"\n\nNow as we stand before the gallows\n\nWaiting for the end\n\nI'll say these final words my friend\n\n\n\nAt sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig\n\nSo raise up your pint of rum and take another swig\n\nThe curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate\n\nSo have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits\n\n\n\nWe returned to port with sorrow in our chests\n\nAn evil shadow followed us on every quest\n\nNever to feel joy again was our fate\n\nOnly misery and death, fear and burning hate\n\n\n\nWe broke the law, betrayed the code\n\nNow time is running out\n\nAn unforgivable offence\n\nOf that there is no doubt\n\nNow as we stand before the gallows\n\nWaiting for the end\n\nI'll say these final words my friend\n\n\n\nAt sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig\n\nSo raise up your pint of rum and take another swig\n\nThe curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate\n\nSo have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits\n\n\n\nMany years have passed now\n\nYet the curse still lives on\n\nAnd now we rot in a black prison cell\n\nWaiting for our true calling in hell\n\nBut for the lives we leave behind\n\nDon't shed a tear, don't cry\n\nThe only way to break this curse\n\nIs for us all to die\n\nNow as we stand before the gallows\n\nWaiting for the end\n\nI'll say these final words my friend\n\n\n\nAt sunrise we'll all dance the hempen jig\n\nSo raise up your pint of rum and take another swig\n\nThe curse of Captain Morgan has led us to this fate\n\nSo have no fear, and don't look back, the afterlife awaits",
