  "lyrics": "This was a church\r\nA house full of prayer\r\nIt ain't that now\r\nI could tear it down\r\nThere's thieves at the altar\r\nA snake wears the crown\n\nHanding you coal\n\nSwearing it's gold\n\n\n\nLook what they've done to this house of love\n\nIt's too late to turn the river to blood\n\nThe saviors come and gone, we're all out of time\n\nThe devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine\n\n\n\nI'd turn things around\n\nI would if I could\n\nCrash through the gates\n\nBreak every chain\n\nJail for the hailers\n\nSing freedoms song\n\nAmazing grace\n\nBurn down this place\n\n\n\nLook what they've done to this house of love\n\nIt's too late to turn the river to blood\n\nThe saviors come and gone, we're all out of time\n\nThe devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine\n\n\n\nLook what they've done to this house of love\n\nLook what they've done to this house of love\n\nThe devil's in the temple and he's making a mess\n\nGot the Mona Lisa, got his hands up her dress\n\nThe gun is in his hand but he ain't gonna confess\n\nHe lies\n\n\n\nLook what they've done to this house of love\n\nIt's too late to turn the river to blood\n\nThe saviors come and gone, we're all out of time\n\nThe devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine\n\nThe devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine\n\nThe devil's in the temple and he ain't no friend of mine",
