  "lyrics": "Walking slowly tryna find a place to go\r\nYou begin to talk about your ex\r\nAnd the way that he would lose control\r\nAnd all your friends are trying to throw me\r\nThey are asking questions I don’t know\r\nBut baby I’d buy you drinks too\n\nBut I don’t think you need no more\n\n\n\nThen you said, \"I need nothing from nobody\"\n\nI can see it on your face you're hurting\n\nGrab a hold of me\n\nOh baby, can’t you see?\n\nThat your past is your past\n\nOh babe, you've got a hold of me…\n\nYou’ve got a hold of me\n\n'Cause your past is past\n\nOh babe, you’ve got a hold of me\n\n\n\nI’m tryna figure you out as you stare back at me\n\nAnd you tell me you don’t like your father\n\n'Cause he would never let you be\n\nAnd now you’re standing beside the window\n\nYou’re covered in the light from the street\n\nAnd I say that it gets cold here in winter\n\n\"Do you want my coat? You’ll freeze\"\n\n\n\nThen you said, \"I need nothing from nobody\"\n\nI can see it on your face you're hurting\n\nGrab a hold of me\n\nOh baby, can’t you see?\n\nThat your past is your past\n\nOh babe, you've got a hold of me…\n\nYou’ve got a hold of me\n\n'Cause your past is past\n\nOh babe, you’ve got a hold of me\n\n\n\nYou’ve been holding on so long\n\nYou keep pushing me out\n\nYou don’t know where you belong\n\n\n\nSo you say to me now\n\n\"I need nothing from nobody\"\n\nI can see it on your face you're hurting\n\nGrab a hold of me\n\nOh baby, can’t you see?\n\nThat your past is your past\n\nOh babe, you've got a hold of me…\n\nYou’ve got a hold of me\n\n'Cause your past is past\n\nOh babe, you’ve got a hold of me",
