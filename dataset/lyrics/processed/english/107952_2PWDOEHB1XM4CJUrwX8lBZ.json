  "lyrics": "I'm too young to die\r\nGonna live forever\r\nI just wanna talk tough, look mean\r\nLife is good at 17\r\nOne thing that I know is that\n\nYou don't know a thing\n\nAbout me\n\nYou were the young, dumb, chosen one\n\nNow you shake your head and say\n\nKids these days\n\n\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\n\nWhat's the meaning of it all?\n\n\n\nWasted all the time\n\nNothing lasts forever\n\nMaybe I should give up the good fight\n\nChange my image overnight\n\n\n\nOne thing that I know is that\n\nYou don't know a thing\n\nAbout me\n\nI am the young, dumb, chosen one\n\nLosing in the loveliest way\n\nKids these days\n\n\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\n\nWhat's the meaning of it all?\n\n\n\nAdolescent intuition\n\nMurder on the rise\n\nMake an easy million\n\nBlow it in a night\n\nTell that I'm pretty\n\nTell me that I'm nice\n\nI know you can see it in my eyes\n\nYou can see it in my eyes\n\nYou can see it in my eyes\n\nSee it in my eyes\n\n\n\nEverybody tries\n\nTries to be somebody\n\nTo be somebody's wet dream, prom king\n\nGolden boy, new toy\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\n\nWhat's the meaning of it all?\n\n\n\nLife is a honeymoon phase\n\nKids these days\n\nKids these days\n\nKids these days",
