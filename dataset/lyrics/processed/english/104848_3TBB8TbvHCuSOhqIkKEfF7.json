  "lyrics": "I knew that I couldn't survive\r\nWithout you by my side\r\nBut I'm alive\r\nI thought that it was more than a tattoo\r\nTry not to get caught in the classroom\r\nTomorrow morning while the galaxy is forming\n\nI'mma find a box of stories\n\nBuried in the garden under the pouring rain\n\nNever seen the storm before it came\n\nFind the strength to forgive my jinx\n\nSwim the length of the kitchen sink\n\nFreedom of speech don't mean what you think\n\nHold that thought I'm about to close the ink\n\nY'all know I never gave a frozen shit\n\nI'm just trying to hold my head above the hopelessness\n\nThey wanna blow some kisses at the showmanship\n\nUntil they're poking at your legacy with broken sticks\n\n\n\nYeah I think I'm going down\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nI'mma drown\n\nWith you\n\nWith you (yeah)\n\n\n\nYeah I think I'm going down\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nI'mma drown\n\nWith you\n\nWith you (yeah)\n\n\n\nHere we go\n\nI'm trying to be peaceful\n\nKeep on clashing with your ego\n\nNo logic or reason when speaking\n\nGet peace and disagreements\n\nTell me what you really thinking when you drinking\n\nSay that you don't mean it\n\nI heard that before\n\nI don't believe it\n\nListen to people\n\nThat tell you everything in how they treat you\n\nView kindness as weakness\n\nSay you don't need me\n\nHard to let go\n\nBut I'm leaving faceless right now\n\nWhat is easy\n\nGet the very leases\n\nExactly what you receive\n\nWhat you see's your reflection of what you think you perceive\n\nDon't make a promise you can't keep\n\nBut keep with these to release repeat the things that you should change\n\nYour hands and things can't point the blame\n\nNo you can't stay\n\nYou can't just take reciprocate make an exchange\n\nI'm lighting sage to cleanse a space\n\nGetting that bad energ-y up off of m-e\n\nReplaced with inner peace\n\nFools call you so expose enemies with false identities\n\nYou're no friend to me so don't pretend to be\n\n\n\nYeah I think I'm going down\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nI'mma drown\n\nWith you\n\nWith you (yeah)\n\n\n\nYeah I think I'm going down\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nI'mma drown\n\nWith you\n\nWith you (yeah)\n\n\n\nI been let down before\n\nLaying against this wall\n\nAin't no use in crying\n\nWhen I'm sober I drink\n\nAlways up when I sink\n\nIn a comer I'm blinking\n\nAnd in my own mistakes\n\nLaying in my bed and rest\n\nAin't no use in trying\n\nWhen I'm shocked I won't shoot\n\nDon't know what\n\nThey're trying to hurt me\n\nLove me then desert me\n\nDon't give me your mercy\n\nFeel like my flesh burn me\n\nSo let's start a fire\n\nGoes on every hour\n\nThey're trying to drown me\n\nFeel like I am falling",
