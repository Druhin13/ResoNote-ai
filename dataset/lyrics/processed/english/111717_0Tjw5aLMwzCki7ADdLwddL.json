  "lyrics": "When hope and love has been lost and you fall to the ground\r\nYou must find a way\r\nWhen the darkness descends and you're told it's the end\r\nYou must find a way\r\nWhen God decides to look the other way and a clown takes the throne\n\nWe must find a way\n\nFace the firing squad, against all the odds\n\nYou must find a way\n\n\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down and find faith\n\nWhen you're close to the edge\n\nWith a gun to your head\n\nYou must find a way\n\n\n\nWhen friends are thin on the ground and they try to divide us\n\nWe must find a way\n\nWe have entered the fray and we will not obey\n\nWe must find a way, yeah\n\n\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down and find faith\n\nWhen they've left you for dead and you can only see red\n\nYou must find a way\n\n\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down, find faith\n\nWe won't let them divide, we will never abide\n\nWe will find a way\n\n\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nFaith\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nFaith",
