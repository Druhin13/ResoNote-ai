  "lyrics": "It's the wake of all evil\r\nA universal mess\r\nI've always found trouble\r\nEven at my best\r\nNo hopes to get better\r\nUntil they put me down to rest\n\nI am a troubled man\n\n\n\nAnxiety and sorrow\n\nUnderneath my skin\n\nSelf destruction and failure\n\nHave beat my head in\n\nI laughed out loud once\n\nI won't do that again\n\nI've always traveled the hellfire road\n\nAnd tasted the sweet smell of sin\n\nI am a troubled man\n\nI am a troubled man\n\n\n\nI am a troubled man\n\nI am a troubled man\n\nSo many things\n\nHave gone through my hands\n\nI am a troubled man\n\n\n\nPeople up on the east side\n\nPeople on the gravel road\n\nPeople of many colors\n\nWhose stories have never been told\n\nToo late came too early\n\nFor me to face myself\n\nI am a troubled man\n\n\n\nI am a troubled man\n\nI am a troubled man (Oh Lord)\n\nI won't do anything\n\nBut hurt you if I can\n\nI am a troubled man",
