  "lyrics": "A scream brakes the silence\nEmerging from the deep\nBanshee draped in shadows\nHer darkness lives inside of me\nSkeletal hands\nA nightmare's embrace\n\nSpectral and elusive\n\nThe wilderness in her I praise\n\n\n\nFlickering lights of an underground thunder\n\n\n\nBreathing down my neck\n\n\n\nCome, become, to be\n\nConveyor of secrets\n\nYour will be done\n\n\n\nOne will become the many when the two have become one\n\nTake me in to be purified\n\nAnd travel outside of time\n\nCross the abyss to the other side\n\nTo the moon in my heart\n\nMy soul, unite\n\nFlickering lights of an underground thunder\n\nBreathing down my neck\n\nCome, become, to be\n\nYou are the thunder\n\nThe perfect mind\n\nDrink my blood\n\nI am your sacrifice\n\nYou are the all, you are the flame\n\nYou are the whole that comes together\n\nHaunting the liberation of mind\n\nThe soul in unity unbound",
