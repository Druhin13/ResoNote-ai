  "lyrics": "What kind of human beings are we really?\r\nWhat has gone into the shaping and molding of who we are\r\nBoth as persons as well as communities and traditions?\r\nThe inescapability of traditions\r\nFor me the greatest tradition is spiritual fortitude in the modern world, which is the black musical tradition\r\nThere's never been a tradition on such intimate terms of catastrophe and still able to generate such unbelievable forms of creativity, compassion, and fortitude\n\n\n\nWhen it was my aisle turn to get up and view the casket\n\nCouldn't hold my tears back, it was automatic\n\nWhen the reverend started preaching, it was sad\n\nAfter the funeral, I hugged his mom and dad\n\nPaid for the memorial, 7000 dollars cash\n\nOnly time we get together is when somebody pass\n\nThe story of many people I narrate\n\nHella hate divide and conquer, separate\n\nWhen I was born, momma didn't feed any baby food to this infant\n\nShe fed me collard greens, dressing, candied yams, and fried chicken\n\nIn the trenches, we trippin', got trials and tribulations\n\nRenovation, they forcing us out, gentrification\n\nLiving in the Bay, it's expensive, it's hard to bargain\n\n2500 a month to rent a 1 bedroom apartment\n\nCancer don't care how old you are or who you are (no, no, no)\n\nLive your life every day like it's no tomorrow (yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nHealth can be your best friend or worst enemy, could be ruthless\n\nLou Gehrig's Disease, leukemia, and lupus\n\nNo Medi-Cal insurance so we self-medicate\n\nEat tomatoes 'cause it helps protect the prostate\n\nSome of my potnas vegan, some just watch the way they eat\n\nSubstitute ground turkey for ground beef, no red meat\n\nIt's mainey outchea, it's murkish and it's sick\n\nEverybody outchea carry and pack a pogo stick\n\n\n\nLife for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)\n\nYeah, life is much different 'round here (Uh)\n\nBut we don't give up\n\nIn God we trust\n\nWhen life shows up around here (Shows up)\n\nSometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)\n\nBut we still rise up (Uh)\n\n\n\nEvery day somebody fighting for they life\n\nEvery second it's a body put on ice\n\nMaggots, flies, vultures, parasites\n\nTag on they toe without a price\n\nIn the middle of the slums rockin' crumbs\n\nSecondhand smoke all in our lungs\n\nWeikel's, Smart & Final, Target\n\nYou liable to find me up in Chavez Supermarket\n\nThe homie's kids and his nephews tryna rap\n\nSay that's the only way to get up out the trap\n\nGettin' on somethin' they only content\n\nI tell them they can be an astronaut or an accountant\n\nCan't wait to get papered up with designer belt on my pants\n\nDo the money dance with the money phone in my hand\n\nLoved ones in a situation and need some cash?\n\nSend it through Square Cash, they'll get it fast\n\nWhen I finally catch a break, it's voodoo\n\nEvery time I catch a break, it fall through\n\nLife is against me, the devil's on me\n\nHe shady, he janky, he ain't my homie\n\nTemptation is vicious, you gotta watch all these bitches\n\nThey'll line you up with no clippers, do anything for they niggas\n\nLife is an assignment, it's a test\n\nRepent, thank God, and confess\n\n\n\nOh, life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)\n\nYeah, life is much different 'round here (What you say?)\n\nBut we don't (we don't) give up (give up)\n\nIn God we trust\n\nWhen life shows up around here (whoa)\n\nSometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)\n\nBut we still rise up (look here)\n\nLife for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)\n\nYeah life is much different 'round here (it's so different round here)\n\nBut we don't give up (it's so different round here)\n\nIn God we trust\n\nWhen life shows up around here (when life shows up)\n\nSometimes it's unfair around here (life shows up)\n\nBut we still rise up (well...)\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm a Jesus loving free Black man\n\nBut I was in deep solidarity and remain so\n\nWith the focus on those poor, precious, priceless children\n\nEven today, one out of two black and brown children live in poverty",
