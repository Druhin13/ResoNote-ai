Do you want me?\n\nDo you need me to be near you?\n\nSo you got somebody next to your body\n\nSomebody next to your body\n\nKeeping me up, keeping me down, keeping me up\n\nKeeping me down, keeping me up, down, up, down\n\nKeeping me up, keeping me down\n\n\n\nLove, love is a feeling (it's not just a feeling)\n\nIf you feel it, you feel it (it's not just a feeling)\n\nLike it's raining\n\nIf you like the feeling of a hard rain falling (love, love is a feeling)\n\nI have a seafull, I can give you an ocean (if you feel it, you feel it, like it's raining)\n\n\n\nIf there's no feeling, no meaning, say something\n\nDid I mean something to you?\n\nYou show nothing, was it real?\n\nDid I block it? It's my fault we lost it\n\nAnd look at us now, us is holding us hostage",
