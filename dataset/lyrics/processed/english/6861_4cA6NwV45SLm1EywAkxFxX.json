  "lyrics": "Don't turn around\r\nThey're screaming\r\nHear the sound\r\nStill dreaming\r\nUnderground\r\nThis feeling\n\nAll the angels die when you were\n\nBorn again\n\nNow falling\n\nFor the damned\n\nStill crawling\n\nIn my hand\n\nIt's calling\n\nAll the demons cry when you begin\n\n\n\nAnd they all march on to the drumbeat\n\nAnd they all march on\n\n\n\nHere's to the lonely hearts and the ones that never change\n\nHere's to the failed starts and the song remains the same\n\nWe will carry on without their lonely hearts\n\n\n\nThey've done it all\n\nJust listen\n\nTake the fall\n\nWhat's missing?\n\nBuild a wall\n\nOf fiction\n\nAll the heroes lie when they are\n\nSick and scared\n\nOf falling\n\nLoud and clear\n\nThey're broken\n\nYet again\n\nYou're saving all the best for last... when your song ends\n\n\n\nAnd they all march on to the drumbeat\n\nAnd they all march on\n\n\n\nHere's to the lonely hearts and the ones that never change\n\nHere's to the failed starts and the song remains the same\n\nWe will carry on without their lonely hearts\n\nWe will carry on without their lonely hearts\n\n\n\nIn the past you were a star\n\nIn your mind of paradise\n\nEvery dream that lives inside\n\nSometimes the future feels so far\n\nAnd it's never always bright\n\nAll your dreams that now have died\n\n\n\nHere's to the lonely hearts and the ones that never change\n\nHere's to the failed starts and the song remains the same\n\nHere's to the lonely hearts and the ones that never change\n\nHere's to the failed starts and the song remains the same\n\nWe will carry on without their lonely hearts\n\nWe will carry on without their lonely hearts",
