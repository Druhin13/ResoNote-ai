  "lyrics": "I'll bring each of these blinds\r\nGet worse each time\r\nI see now, come as you are\r\nI've been holding back, but no more\r\nBlue sunrise if you've had a change of heart\n\nWon't you sit back if you feel a cheater?\n\nUp in your head, all this talking out of line\n\nTry and keep up with me\n\n\n\nIf we just do what we can\n\nIt always gets so out of hand with you\n\nI know that you don't understand\n\nJust stay, wash over now\n\n\n\nSee my desire\n\nTakes more to inspire\n\nAll the porn you glare on the side\n\nGets so hard to fix once your pride\n\n\n\nGoing nowhere\n\nTaken, all clear\n\nFace down, falling\n\nBecause you never know what's there\n\n\n\nBlue sunrise, if they fall down, let it go\n\nYou can get back once you need it from me\n\n\n\nIf we just do what we can\n\nIt always gets so out of hand with you\n\nI know that you don't understand\n\nJust stay, wash over now\n\n\n\nThis place got a hold on me\n\nBut it's not what I need\n\nLet it show, take me home to find\n\nEverything I see\n\n\n\nIf we just do what we can\n\nIt always gets so out of hand with you\n\nI know that you don't understand\n\nJust stay, wash over now",
