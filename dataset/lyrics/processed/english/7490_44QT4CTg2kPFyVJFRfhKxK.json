  "lyrics": "Nothing comes natural\r\nI don’t feel my body is a vessel\r\nBut you seem to\r\nBut you seem to\r\nYou are a word I made up when I’m high\n\nI gave you meaning but I don’t know why\n\nAnd you can make me cry\n\nOnly you can make me cry\n\n\n\nYou look like\n\nA cloud drifting off\n\nAm I allowed to watch?\n\nI’m not allowed to watch\n\n\n\nNow you don’t have to listen\n\nTo the shapes that I make with them\n\nAre you only on a mission\n\nIs it fine that I miss them?\n\n\n\nWalking alone in midtown at night\n\nLike fog that disappears quickly, I\n\nLeave no mark at all\n\nLeave no mark at all\n\n\n\n‘Cause we move at just the same time\n\nAlmost like sex because it’s so fun\n\nI throw my wrists like yours all night long\n\nStay alive by nodding along",
