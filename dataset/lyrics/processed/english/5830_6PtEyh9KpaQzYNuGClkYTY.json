Smith\n\nI would definitely put my hand in your pocket\n\nBut not the way you want\n\nI put your whole family in boxes like y'all the Brady Bunch\n\n\n\nPut the rap game on a crunch\n\nBlow the spot without warning\n\nYou get no chance to back down\n\nPut the rap game on a crunch\n\nBlow the spot without warning\n\nYou get no chance to back down\n\n\n\nI go bananas, too miraculous to react to mortal mammals\n\nCookin' crack in my new velour pajamas\n\nGettin' back to my roots, rap where I stored 'em hammers\n\nLord of Grammar, my IQ's my actual portal panel\n\nMy IP address is my dressers drawer, I ain't stressed unless it's war\n\nI ain't said shit unless it's more, I bet you you'll die less than my irons legend for regrettin' gore\n\nGhost whiter than the driven snow and it's headed north\n\nLookin' like it's for the seven floors, flows are metaphors\n\nBuried skulls all over the globe like a Stegosaurus\n\nMy rifle kick back when it get blazed in the sky\n\nI'm a classic, I get dressed playin' Aquemini\n\nDon't do some shit to get your wifey kidnapped\n\nHave you on Twitter beggin' for your bitch back like Sage Gemini\n\nWhy these niggas gettin' their hair dyed and they nails polished\n\nI'm like Biggie and Pac trapped inside of Big L's body\n\n\n\nRhymes I create a knock out ya gold tooth\n\nBattlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth\n\nI wreck mics and drop the cool speeches\n\nNowadays rappers think they motherfuckin' schoolteachers",
