  "lyrics": "Feel the fire he's entering the ring\r\nHis mindset only knows how to win\r\nThis Danish fighter will break you in two\r\nYou will feel all his power\r\nThe Viking warrior Mikkel Lessler will now brand his name\n\nIn the back of your head\n\nYeah you feel the floor again\n\nUnleashing his hell you will not even hear the bell\n\nMaybe you're strong but you don't stand a chance\n\n\n\nFeel the power of the warrior\n\nFight, fight, fight, fight\n\nLet's get ready to rumble\n\nBreaking your record and breaking your bones\n\nBon a warrior with a code\n\nA champion feeding your face with a fist\n\nYou will feel all his power\n\nFeel the power of a warrior\n\nLet's get ready to rumble\n\nA gladiator's left and hook\n\nFeel the pain tomorrow\n\n\n\nBehold here comes the son\n\nBelieve it he was born to be the chosen one\n\nThe call is for a warrior\n\nHis name will echo in the sea and on the ground",
