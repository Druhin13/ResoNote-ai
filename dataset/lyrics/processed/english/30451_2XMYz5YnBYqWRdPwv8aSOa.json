  "lyrics": "I can't help the way I want\r\nI was born on a Friday\r\nNeed new air in my lungs\r\nLovin' me a good sideways\r\nMy disciples are only happy when I'm leading\n\nSaying \"it's too late to be a crooner\"\n\nI'm okay with\n\nBeing a late bloomer\n\n\n\nMama, I'm going sideways\n\n[oh whoa]\n\nMama, I'm going sideways\n\n[oh whoa]\n\nDo you feel like you want to feel?\n\n[hey yeah yea]\n\n\n\nSmiling, dancing, make believing I was happy\n\nBut the prettier the picture, the bored-er the bitch is\n\nIt was a Sunday or someday or a something\n\nAnd I was getting ready, dressed up for nothing\n\nAin't got nothing on my agenda\n\nStill no time to call my Mama, mama, mama...\n\n\n\nMama, I'm going sideways\n\n[oh whoa]\n\nMama, I'm going sideways\n\n[oh whoa]\n\nDo you feel like you want to feel?\n\n[hey yeah yea]\n\n\n\nIt was a Tuesday and I was the Lizard Queen\n\nHad on my cheap jeans and I was dreaming\n\nHeavy, wholeheartedly\n\nAbout the things I want to be\n\nAnd all the things I wasn't --\n\nI knew I'd need a budget\n\nGot me a job and planned real good\n\nBut all the planning didn't go as it should\n\nI was distracted by the people walking faster than me\n\n\n\nI'm going sideways\n\n[oh whoa]\n\nI'm going sideways\n\n[oh whoa]\n\nDo you feel like you want to feel?\n\n[hey yeah yea]\n\nLike you want to feel?\n\n[hey yeah yea]\n\nLike you need to feel?\n\n[hey yeah yea]",
