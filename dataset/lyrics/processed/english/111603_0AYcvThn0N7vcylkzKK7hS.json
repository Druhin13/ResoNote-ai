  "lyrics": "I was lost until you found me\r\nYou're the reason for my today\r\nWas tempest tossed, now I sleep soundly\r\nThanks to you I gladly say\r\nThat if your goldmine comes up empty\n\nI'll be there to work the claim\n\nIf you're a captain of a shipwreck\n\nI'll be first mate to your shame\n\n\n\nTrust in me to share your burden\n\nStand by you where I belong\n\nWhen life brings the day uncertain\n\nI will soothe you with my song\n\n\n\nAnd if your goldmine comes up empty\n\nI'll be there to work the claim\n\nIf you're a captain of a shipwreck\n\nI'll be first mate to your shame\n\n\n\nFear no flood in stormy weather\n\nFear no fire if winds arise\n\nFlesh and blood, I'm yours forever\n\nAnd forever, it never dies\n\n\n\nAnd if your goldmine comes up empty\n\nI'll be there to work the claim\n\nIf you're a captain of a shipwreck\n\nI'll be first mate to your shame\n\n\n\nIf you're a captain of a shipwreck\n\nYou can find me up on the top deck\n\nYou'll be captain of a shipwreck\n\nI'll be first mate to your shame.",
