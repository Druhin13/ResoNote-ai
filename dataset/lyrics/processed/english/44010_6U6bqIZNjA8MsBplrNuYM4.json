  "lyrics": "(Music: Ken Hirsch Words: Marti Sharron)\r\nI look back on all those good times\r\nWe once shared and I must have been blind\r\nJust to think I'd find someone new\r\nOne who'd love me better than you\n\n\n\nWell, it may come as a surprise\n\nLoneliness has opened my eyes\n\nI tried every love I could find\n\nStill I can't get you out of my mind\n\n\n\nChorus: Cause there's no one in the world to hold me\n\n\n\nNo one in the world's gonna move me\n\nNo one in the world can love me like you do, baby\n\n\n\nEverytime I'm with someone I'm\n\nLoving you yet, and want to run\n\nSlowly, love me\n\nAll is forsaken, I love the love we're making\n\nCause it's truly lovely\n\nI'll never leave you, you'll know I need you baby\n\n\n\nChorus: From beginning to end 365 days of the year\n\nI want your same ol' love\n\nAll I want to do is share my life with you\n\nI want your same ol' love\n\n\n\n(Repeat Chorus)",
