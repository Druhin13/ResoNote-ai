  "lyrics": "“Hello, hello? Okay, listen, I have no idea where you are or how you got there. What I do know is that the guy you were seen with last night? He’s bad news. B-but the good news is, if you’re hearing this, chances are you’re still alive. Look, stay calm, and, if you can, avoid him at all costs. Do your best to hold out until morning. Please, just... stay alive.”\r\nWe're back, revamped\r\nThe madness never ends\r\nWe're not alone\r\nThis time we've brought some friends\n\nNo doors, no hope\n\nBut you keep coming back\n\nBut if this is what you want\n\nThen you can be just like us\n\n\n\nIt's what we're made to do\n\nYou act like we're to blame\n\nWear a mask to hide yourself\n\nWhen really it makes us the same\n\nA couple hours, but it's feelin' like days\n\nNow you're runnin' out of power\n\nLeave you mangled and winding away\n\n\n\nStep one: check lights\n\nAnd empty out the hall\n\nDid you hear that?\n\nThere's bangin' in the walls\n\nEnjoy your new job\n\n'Cause it might be your last\n\nIf you find it's 6 AM\n\nWe'll see you tomorrow\n\n\n\nIt's what we're made to do\n\nYou act like we're to blame\n\nWear a mask to hide yourself\n\nWhen really it makes us the same\n\nA couple hours but it's feelin' like days\n\nNow you're runnin' out of power\n\nLeave you mangled...\n\n\n\nIt's what we're made to do\n\nYou act like we're to blame\n\nWear a mask to hide yourself\n\nWhen really it makes us the same\n\nA couple hours but it's feelin' like days\n\nNow you're runnin' out of power\n\nLeave you mangled and winding away",
