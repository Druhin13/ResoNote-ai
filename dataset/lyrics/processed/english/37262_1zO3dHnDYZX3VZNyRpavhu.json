  "lyrics": "Hey it's me\r\nI just don't think I can do this anymore\r\nI've got whiskey on my breath\r\nAnd destruction on my hands\r\nAnd you're just too tired to fight\n\nAfter this last second chance\n\nShe said, \"You can have it all\"\n\nOr you can walk away\n\nI know what I should do\n\nBut I only know how to stay\n\n\n\nYou won't see me again\n\n\n\nIn every photograph\n\nThe same old smiling face\n\nWe could always hide the pain\n\nAnd those times I can't replace\n\nTears held in right, she said\n\n\"Do you wanna be alone?\"\n\nI just turned with my head bowed\n\nStepped out into the cold\n\n\n\nI'm scared\n\nThat you won't see me again\n\n\n\nWent outside\n\nUnder the storm in the night\n\nAnd I fell to my knees\n\nPraying \"God, can you find me\"\n\n\n\n9 months down the road\n\nOn the steps of a halfway house\n\nA bin of vacant souls\n\nHelp carry my things out\n\nTears fall from my eyes\n\nShe's waiting there for me\n\nFor the first time in my life\n\nKnow I'm finally free\n\n\n\nAnd I whisper\n\nTo the demons\n\nYou won't see me again",
