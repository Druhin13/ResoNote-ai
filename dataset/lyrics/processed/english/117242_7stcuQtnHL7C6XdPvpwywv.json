(Riding this, riding in this)\n\nOr are we dreaming? (Riding this, riding in this)\n\nAfter the ride\n\nAre you living? (Riding this, riding in this)\n\n\n\nI’ve been better, often broken\n\nI've been battered up and beat\n\nI wish I was more outspoken\n\nBut the words are out of reach\n\nHmm, thought I loved you in the moment\n\nI was happy, I was not\n\nI've been learning, I’ve been growing\n\nBut the worst is yet to come\n\n\n\nCriticized, who am I to give up?\n\nAnd breathing was the reason to live\n\nSympathize, who am I to give up?\n\nPutting on my favorite record\n\n\n\nAre we alive?\n\nOr are we dreaming?\n\nAfter the ride\n\nAre you living?\n\nAre we alive?
