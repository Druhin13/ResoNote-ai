  "lyrics": "Dually kickin' up dust on a one lane road\r\nJoe Diffie tunes hummin' out the radio\r\nAnd the night so young as we are right now\r\nSittin' frozen in time on the edge of town\r\nThe water tower says the same thing\r\nJohn Deere Green with the same names\n\nA little faded but it still looks good\n\nIn my neck of the woods, neck of the woods\n\nMy neck of the woods (my neck of the woods)\n\nIn my neck of the woods\n\n\n\nThere's stop signs that I ran through like Richard Petty at Daytona\n\nBlack marks where I slammed the brakes, where that blacktop first had meat on it\n\nDoing 75 in a 35 with a spray painted 3 off on the side\n\nJammin' out to that cassette tape, yellin' country boys we can survive\n\nWe all wanted to be Duke boys, lookin' for a Jeep with Daisy in it\n\nBarefoot bandit since day one, plenty underpasses with a past in it\n\nThem rope swings ain't been used in ten years and that's no lie\n\nBut that swimmin' hole still look ice cold and this place ain't aged a day in time\n\n\n\nDually kickin' up dust on a one lane road\n\nJoe Diffie tunes hummin' out the radio\n\nAnd the night so young as we are right now\n\nSittin' frozen in time on the edge of town\n\nThe water tower says the same thing\n\nJohn Deere Green with the same names\n\nA little faded but it still looks good\n\nIn my neck of the woods, neck of the woods\n\nMy neck of the woods (my neck of the woods)\n\nIn my neck of the woods\n\n\n\nIf I die you can see the artwork on my skin that tells the life I lived\n\nSee the marks I left through all these songs I wrote when I'sa kid\n\nAnd look back at the pictures of these sold out shows across the states\n\nWhen I put these boots up, yeah, I've danced across a couple dusty stages\n\nAnd I look back at the town and play a record from like 30 back\n\nPlay Rollin' Stoned a couple times and still roll up a joint so fat\n\nI'll be rockin' and rollin' in a rocking chair made of wood\n\nLookin' at the water tower road with the hill right by the sun come\n\n\n\nDually kickin' up dust on a one lane road\n\nJoe Diffie tunes hummin' out the radio\n\nAnd the night so young as we are right now\n\nSittin' frozen in time on the edge of town\n\nThe water tower says the same thing\n\nJohn Deere Green with the same names\n\nA little faded but it still looks good\n\nIn my neck of the woods, neck of the woods\n\nMy neck of the woods (my neck of the woods)\n\nIn my neck of the woods\n\n\n\nMy neck of the woods, my end of the road\n\nThat football field that we practiced on\n\nHad that parkin' lot hoppin' on a Friday night at Sonic\n\n'Til the neon lights were down and a field party started\n\n\n\nIn my neck of the woods\n\nIn my neck of the woods\n\nIn my neck of the woods\n\nMy neck of the woods (my neck of the woods)",
