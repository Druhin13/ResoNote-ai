  "lyrics": "When I had my tracheotomy\r\nI was blue and had stopped breathing\r\nThere was something wrong with me\r\nDoctors cut through the cartilage and skin\r\nAt the bottom of my throat\r\nAnd then they snaked that trach tube in\n\n\n\nAnd I was one and a half\n\nI was my parents only kid\n\nAnd they had lost two before that\n\nAnd growing up, I always knew how close I'd come\n\nWell, that must have been scary, Mom\n\n\n\nGary Coleman, he was \"Arnold\" on TV\n\nWell, I grew up watching him and Conrad Bain and Kimberly\n\nIt turns out that he had a trach scar too\n\nWhere they cut into his throat\n\nAnd then they threaded that tube through\n\n\n\nBut that was much later on\n\nIn the year that he turned forty when his fanbase was all gone\n\nAnd his health was so touch-and-go\n\nHis girlfriend proposed\n\nBut they broke up on a TV show\n\n\n\nMary Wells, she was known as Motown's Queen\n\nBut laryngeal cancer left her unable to sing\n\nThey tried radiation, multiple surgeries\n\nBut she didn't have insurance and lost almost everything\n\nPoor thing\n\n\n\nBut Diana Ross helped with her bills\n\nAretha Franklin tried her very best to help out Mary Wells\n\nAnd Dionne Warwick did all she could do\n\nAnd Mary Wells, she pulled through\n\nFor one more year or two\n\n\n\nDylan Thomas looked completely pale and weak\n\nOn a trip to New York City to promote his poety\n\nThree straight days of drinking out in Greenwich and Chelsea\n\nHe was taken to the hospital, turned blue and not breathing\n\n\n\nAnd Caitlin Thomas said\n\nWhen she walked into St Vincent's\n\n\"Is the bloody man dead yet?\"\n\nAnd later that day she got so drunk she was restrained\n\nAnd her husband slipped away\n\n\n\nRay Davies had a tracheotomy\n\nHe was at St. Thomas' Hospital in London, aged thirteen\n\nAnd during his long recovery\n\nNurses put him in a wheelchair\n\nAnd they'd wheel him out onto a balcony (on a balcony)\n\n\n\nAnd down that evening sun did sink\n\nPainting London and the river and that freaked-out future Kink\n\nWaterloo lit up for one sick kid\n\nAnd, at 23, he recorded a song about it",
