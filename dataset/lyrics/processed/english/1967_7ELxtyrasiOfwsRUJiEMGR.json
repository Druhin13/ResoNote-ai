  "lyrics": "When you feel you're taking all that you can take\r\nAnd you're sure you're never gonna catch a break\r\nAnd the tears are rivers running down your face, yeah\r\nWhen your faith is low and you've got no strength left\r\nWhen you think you've gone as far as you can get\r\nAnd you're too undone to take another step\n\n\n\nOh I will take up the struggle\n\nOh I know it's a fight\n\n\n\nSo I'll fight, fight that war for you\n\nI'll fight, stand and defend you\n\nTake your side, that's what I'm here to do\n\nI'll be there to be strong\n\nOh I'll keep on, keep on the fight\n\n\n\nWhen it's dangerous, takes another piece of you\n\nEverybody takes all they can get from you\n\nTill you're left with almost nothing left of you\n\nWhen each night is like a battle you can't win\n\nAnd the pain is like a weight you're carrying\n\nI will be the one to help you carry it\n\n\n\nOh I will take all your troubles\n\nOh I know it's a fight\n\n\n\nSo I'll fight, fight that war for you\n\nI'll fight, stand and defend you\n\nTake your side, that's what I'm here to do\n\nI'll be there to be strong\n\nOh I'll keep on, keep on the fight\n\n\n\nI'll help your back when your backs to the wall\n\nI'll catch the tears when your tears fall\n\nI will give it all I won't give up the fight\n\n\n\nSo I'll fight, fight that war for you\n\nI'll fight, stand and defend you\n\nTake your side, that's what I'm here to do\n\nI'll be there to be strong\n\nOh I'll keep on, keep on the fight\n\n\n\nI'll fight, fight that war for you\n\nI'll fight, stand and defend you\n\nTake your side, take your side, take your side\n\nThat's what I'm here to do\n\nI'll be there to be strong (I'll be there, I'll be strong)\n\nOh I'll keep on, keep on the fight\n\nI'll fight, I'll fight",
