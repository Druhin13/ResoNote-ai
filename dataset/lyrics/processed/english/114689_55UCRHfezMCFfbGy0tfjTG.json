  "lyrics": "I killed my first monster when I was seven years old\r\nHe melted like butter in my bathroom's sixty-watt bulb\r\nKept a three-cell MagLite from Daddy's workshop drawer\r\nUnder my pillow and I'd pull it like a sword\r\nAnymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night\n\nFallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light\n\nI keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said\n\n'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed\n\n\n\nThe wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart\n\nA minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark\n\nGreed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap\n\nYou can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that\n\n\n\nAnymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night\n\nFallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light\n\nI keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said\n\n'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed\n\n\n\nDaddy, check my closet, leave on the bathroom light\n\nI smile and say \"All clear\" when I tuck him in for the night\n\nBut Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?\n\nI kneel down beside my little man and I bow my head\n\n\n\nAnymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night\n\nFallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light\n\nI keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said\n\n'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed\n\nI've learned that the monsters ain't underneath the bed",
