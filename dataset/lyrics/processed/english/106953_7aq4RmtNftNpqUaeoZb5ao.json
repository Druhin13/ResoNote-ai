  "lyrics": "Sitting in a mess still undressed\r\nAs a kettle whistle blows\r\nPaperback novelette still open\r\nAnd the door is closed\r\nYou got a real sick mind\n\nYou write a column for The Times\n\nFor all the lovers gone blind\n\nWho are looking for a sign\n\n\n\nAnd when the night is over\n\nAnd the drugs are gone\n\nAll you've got is your four leaf clover\n\nYou keep inside your coat\n\nAnd when the night is over\n\nAnd the drugs are gone\n\nYou feel the world is getting colder\n\nYou got no one to hold\n\n\n\nSix pages down and she's lighting up\n\nHer trainwreck soul\n\nShe was abandoned by her lover\n\nLeft by the road\n\nSo apalling, scrawling those bullshit words\n\nIt's thirsty work\n\nShe'll stumble down to the booze in her\n\nJust to have a flirt\n\n\n\nYou got a real sick mind\n\nYou write a column for The Times\n\nFor all the lovers gone blind\n\nWho are looking for a sign\n\n\n\nAnd when the night is over\n\nAnd the drugs are gone\n\nAll you've got is your four leaf clover\n\nYou keep inside your coat\n\nAnd when the night is over\n\nAnd the drugs are gone\n\nYou feel the world is getting colder\n\nYou got no one to hold\n\nYou got no one to hold\n\n\n\nYou got a real sick mind\n\nYou got a real sick mind\n\n\n\nAnd when the night is over\n\nAnd the drugs are gone\n\nAll you've got is a four leaf clover\n\nYou keep inside your coat\n\nAnd when the night is over\n\nAnd the drugs are gone\n\nYou feel the world is getting colder\n\nYou got no one to hold\n\n\n\nYou got no one to hold\n\nYou got no one to hold\n\nYou got no one to hold",
