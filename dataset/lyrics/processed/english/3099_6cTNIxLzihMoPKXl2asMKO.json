  "lyrics": "And now, for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics\r\nGrowing up, I had a dream in my mind\r\nThen it came true, now it got me losing my mind\r\nI don't wanna seem ungrateful so I keep it inside\r\nGot me reminiscing, thinking of a simpler time\n\nLike me and Lopez used to skate down the block\n\nPassing time, spitting rhymes at the old parking lot\n\nI can't even drive past all the spots that I love\n\n'Cause they're nothing even close to anything like it was\n\nBut when I see a group of kids in the spot\n\nI wanna shake, I wanna tell 'em they don't know what they got\n\nWish that I could travel back and try to tell me to stop\n\n'Cause I had everything, I never needed a lot\n\n\n\nIt's like I woke up one day and suddenly I grew up\n\nI can't remember what had happened, it was all too abrupt\n\nDrive around my old town, it's pathetic, I know\n\nThe only time that I was happy and I can't let it go\n\n\n\nWas it all really better then?\n\nOr am I just getting in my head?\n\nAnd I just wanna go back\n\nI wish that I could just go back\n\nWas it all really better then?\n\nOr am I just getting in my head?\n\nAnd I just wanna go back\n\nI wish that I could just go back\n\n\n\nI would never trade a friend for the fame\n\nBut I been on the road touring and it isn't the same\n\nLosing touch with all the ones that I love\n\nHow many calls I gotta miss 'til they stop giving a fuck?\n\nBeen feeling down so I hit up my mom\n\nShe told me everything will pass so put it all in a song\n\nI know my family can see I got a lot on my plate\n\nSeems like every time I'm home it's only just for the day\n\nSo I been putting all my thoughts in this verse\n\nAnd I don't know that if it's helping or it's making it worse\n\nI just know its been a while since I felt like I'm fine\n\nI've been trying to learn to live my life one day at a time\n\n\n\nIt's like I woke up one day and suddenly I grew up\n\nI can't remember what had happened, it was all too abrupt\n\nDrive around my old town, it's pathetic, I know\n\nThe only time that I was happy and I can't let it go\n\n\n\nWas it all really better then?\n\nOr am I just getting in my head?\n\nAnd I just wanna go back\n\nI wish that I could just go back\n\nWas it all really better then?\n\nOr am I just getting in my head?\n\nAnd I just wanna go back\n\nI wish that I could just go back",
