  "lyrics": "This is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\r\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\r\nYeah, I love her, and I could never leave her lonely\r\nRing, ring on the iPhone it was my homie\r\nHe told me, “If you can make it out to L.A\n\nAnd you find a place to stay\n\nWe can make a little bread so what you thinking”\n\nI think that sounds like a plan\n\nNever buy a spirit when you’re hopping on a plane\n\nDang\n\nAll I need is one chance like Biggie\n\nTo make it, and if I do I'll bring my whole city with me\n\nDang\n\nI heard you talking crazy on a group text\n\nI guess every crew needs a Judas\n\nI want to keep the peace like a Buddhist\n\nBut if you cross the line I’ll put you into a suplex\n\nHey, you’re supposed to be a Christian\n\nI am, so mind your business\n\nYeah, I’m trying to be the best me\n\nSo, if you see me racing home it’s ‘cause I got someone to see\n\n\n\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\n\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\n\n\n\nOk, I still feel like I'm 18 literally\n\nNo pains in my knees, no shakes in my hands, and the words I can see ‘em so vividly\n\nSo, to me I approach the game differently\n\nSafe to say that the gangs made history\n\nLife was the price, yes, Christ gave His for me\n\nSo, I'm quickly reminded of what this could be\n\nWhat if the words I utter could change history\n\nI feel like Carman in ‘89\n\nKept my old shirts I gotta give ‘em to fear of God\n\nWait\n\nI rap for ‘em, off the platform\n\nTake my time I don't rhyme normal\n\nHold up\n\nAnd this for the time you felt hopeless\n\nFor the times that you said you wasn't satisfied\n\nKnow it sound like I'm going off a checklist\n\nI’m just trying to say it all before I say goodbye\n\n\n\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\n\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\n\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye\n\nThis is the part where you leave without saying goodbye",
