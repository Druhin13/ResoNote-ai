  "lyrics": "The conversation started something like this\r\n“You wanna cigarette” - I said “I’m trying to quit”\r\nI kept it cool, but she was pretty serious\r\nI should've walked away, I could’ve walked away\r\nI shoulda walked away\r\nWhen it was quiet on the line while I waited\n\nIt felt a little long, it felt a little long\n\nThe silent type - so what had I created?\n\nIt didn't feel that great, it shouldn't feel that way\n\nDon't shoot the messenger if you want to read it\n\nGiven you know what's right, you're looking for a fight\n\nAin't hard to lie but it's harder to believe it\n\nDon't matter if it's wrong, you know where you belong\n\nYou know where you belong\n\nEverybody wants what they cannot have\n\nThough some will never get it - never hurts to ask\n\nEverybody starts with the same motivation\n\nA little bit of love, a little less conversation\n\nI couldn't tell if she bought my excuses\n\nSo my unlucky guess was she was not impressed\n\nAlthough it seems she's the type that never loses\n\nI knew I couldn't stay ‘cause it was getting late\n\nMy soul confession was one she didn't need it\n\nShe didn't listen well, she didn't listen well\n\nTilted her head right before she starts to lean in\n\nShe wouldn't be denied, I had to close my eyes\n\nI had to close my eyes\n\nEverybody wants what they cannot have\n\nThough some will never get it - never hurts to ask\n\nEverybody tries but it won't add up, you’ll be way better off\n\nYou'll be way better off there\n\nEverybody acts like their hands are clean\n\nAnd always go and lie about the same old things\n\nEverybody starts with the same motivation\n\nA little bit of love, a little less conversation\n\nThe conversation started something like this\n\n“You wanna cigarette” - I said “I'm trying to quit”\n\nI kept it cool but she was pretty serious\n\nI should've walked away, I could’ve walked away",
