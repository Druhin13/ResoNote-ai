  "lyrics": "I just need to stop right now\r\nThink I’m really lost right now\r\nI’m just so exhausted now\r\nI’m feeling all this pressure now\r\nI just wanna waste all day\r\nChill out and play some video games\n\nSmoke out on my boyfriend’s couch\n\nSometimes I wanna just peace out, just peace out\n\n\n\nSeven seconds, seven seconds in heaven\n\nGimme seven seconds to get out of my head and\n\nGimme seven seconds just to find a little zen and\n\nGimme seven seconds, seven seconds in heaven\n\n\n\nTake me to the minute I was feeling like a star\n\nTake me to the minute we got twisted in your car\n\nTake me for a minute and I know we can escape\n\nGimme seven seconds ‘cause I need to get away\n\nThe minute that we felt like we was flying in the sky\n\nThe minute we were suiciding down Mulholland Drive\n\nTake me to the minute when the world still had a vibe\n\nGimme seven seconds ‘cause I need to feel alive\n\n\n\nAre you home tonight?\n\nDrop out, let's watch some Walter White\n\nForget about the scene and then\n\nLay back and let the night fade in\n\nI wanna decompress with you\n\nI’m tired of living in a zoo\n\nI think I’m done with all the hate\n\nI’m thinking that the world can wait, world can wait\n\n\n\nSeven seconds, seven seconds in heaven\n\nGimme seven seconds to get out of my head and\n\nGimme seven seconds just to find a little zen and\n\nGimme seven seconds, seven seconds in heaven\n\n\n\nTake me to the minute I was feeling like a star\n\nTake me to the minute we got twisted in your car\n\nTake me for a minute and I know we can escape\n\nGimme seven seconds ‘cause I need to get away\n\nThe minute that we felt like we was flying in the sky\n\nThe minute we were suiciding down Mulholland Drive\n\nTake me to the minute when the world still had a vibe\n\nGimme seven seconds ‘cause I need to feel alive\n\n\n\nCelestial beings on celestial thrones\n\nCan one of y'all pick up your cellular phones?\n\nCelestial beings in celestial homes\n\nWe make such a mess when you leave us alone\n\n\n\nGimme seven seconds, seven seconds in heaven\n\nGimme seven seconds to get out of my head and\n\nGimme seven seconds to get a little less conscious\n\nSeven seconds, then I’ll get back to the nonsense\n\nSeven seconds, oh, it’s something I desire\n\nSeven seconds, y’all, it’s something that I earned\n\nGimme seven seconds and I’ll find a little zen\n\nSeven seconds, seven seconds in heaven\n\n\n\nTake me to the minute I was feeling like a star\n\nTake me to the minute we got twisted in your car\n\nTake me for a minute and I know we can escape\n\nGimme seven seconds ‘cause I need to get away\n\nThe minute that we felt like we was flying in the sky\n\nThe minute we were suiciding down Mulholland Drive\n\nTake me to the minute when the world still had a vibe\n\nGimme seven seconds ‘cause I need to feel alive\n\n\n\nSeven seconds\n\nGimme seven seconds\n\nSeven seconds\n\nSeven seconds, seven seconds in heaven",
