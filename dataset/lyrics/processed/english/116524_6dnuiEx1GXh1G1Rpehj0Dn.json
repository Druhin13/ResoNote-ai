  "lyrics": "When the lights come on, the party's over\r\nAnd I ain't got no car to drive you home\r\nWould the night be to cold for me to hold you\r\nWould you stay, would you leave me all alone?\r\n'Cause all the money in the world won't mean a thing\n\nWith the hole in my heart it won't beat again\n\nIt's true, oh, without you\n\nOh, I've been laying in the dark, been out of my mind\n\nI've fallen from the heights and crashing through the lows\n\nNow I need to know\n\n\n\nCan you give me love? Give me love\n\nWhen I'm standing here with nothing\n\nWould you show me I'm worth something?\n\nGive me love, give me love\n\nWhen it feels like it's all over\n\nWould you stay and pull me closer?\n\n\n\nGive me love\n\nGive me love\n\n\n\nIf it rain in the middle of summer\n\nWould you lay in the grass like we used to do\n\nWould you run, would you leave or change your number?\n\nIf someone gave you the things I couldn't give to you\n\n\n\n'Cause all the money in the world won't mean a thing\n\nWith the hole in my heart it won't beat again\n\nIt's true, oh, without you\n\nOh, I've been laying in the dark, been out of my mind\n\nI've fallen from the heights and crashing through the lows\n\nNow I need to know\n\n\n\nCan you give me love? Give me love\n\nWhen I'm standing here with nothing\n\nWould you show me I'm worth something?\n\nGive me love, give me love\n\nWhen it feels like it's all over\n\nWould you stay and pull me closer?\n\n\n\nGive me love\n\nGive me love\n\n\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give it up, I'll give it up\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give it up\n\n\n\nCan you give me love? (I'll give you all my love) Give me love\n\n(I'll give you all my love)\n\nWhen I'm standing here with nothing\n\nWould you show me I'm worth something?\n\nGive me love, (I'll give you all my love) give me love\n\n(I'll give you all my love)\n\nWhen it feels like it's all over\n\nWould you stay and pull me closer?\n\n\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give it up, I'll give it up\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give it up, I'll give it up\n\nI'll give you all my love\n\nI'll give it up, I'll give it up",
