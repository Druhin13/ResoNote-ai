  "lyrics": "I was only ten years old\r\nLike the back of my hand knew the roads\r\nI swerved my bike and lost control\r\nOver the handles in the air\r\nA lady who came walking by found me lying there\r\nAnd the nurse at the hospital said\n\n\n\n\"Little boy, don't be scared\n\nNow your father is waiting in the next room\n\nLittle boy, don't be sad\n\nNow your mom's on her way, you'll be out of here soon\"\n\n\n\nWe drove so slowly through these streets\n\nIn the suburbs of our dreams\n\nAt night my father closed his eyes\n\nHe saw the new car in the drive\n\nMy mother standing in the doorway\n\nFriday night, a smile on her face\n\nAnd the voice I can hear in my head\n\n\n\n\"Little boy, don't be scared\n\nNow you know we'll be sleeping in the next room\n\nLittle boy, don't be sad\n\nNow tomorrow is as it is coming 'round soon\"\n\n\n\nWe only need a little space\n\nJust somewhere we could call our place\n\nMy mother standing in the doorway\n\nFriday night, a smile on her face\n\nThese things always start so small\n\nWith no applause and no drum roll\n\nAnd I came running up the hallway\n\nSee the car turn in the driveway\n\n\n\nAnd I'll always be that little boy\n\nAnd I've always been that little boy\n\nYeah, I'll always be that little boy\n\nAnd I'll always be that little boy",
