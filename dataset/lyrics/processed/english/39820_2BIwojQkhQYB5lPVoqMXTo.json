  "lyrics": "I know what you were feeling\r\nWhen you played me that song\r\nGave every word meaning\r\nYou showed me a place we belonged\r\nAnd we laughed and we danced and we never looked back\n\nNothing would get in our way\n\nAnd you showed me the meaning of love and romance\n\nWith every song that you played\n\n\n\nThe music's too sad without you\n\nThe silence is all I can listen to now\n\nI can't sing along to the songs like I used to\n\nThe music's too sad when you're not around\n\n\n\nI remember that feeling\n\n(The songs that you played)\n\nYou felt like home\n\nSo why am I leaving?\n\nLeaving you all alone\n\n\n\n'Cause we laughed and we danced and we never looked back\n\nNothing would get in our way\n\nAnd you showed me the meaning of love and romance\n\nI miss the song that you played\n\n\n\nThe music's too sad without you\n\nThe silence is all I can listen to now\n\nI can't sing along to the songs like I used to\n\nThe music's too sad when you're not around\n\n\n\nSo I listen to the wind in the trees\n\nThe sound of the air\n\nYour voice is lost in the breeze\n\nWhen you're not there\n\n(The songs that you played)\n\n\n\nThe music's too sad without you\n\n(The songs that you played)\n\nThe music's too sad without you\n\nOooh\n\n(The songs that you played)\n\nThe music's too sad",
