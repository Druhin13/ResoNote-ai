  "lyrics": "I can keep a secret from my mama, I can keep a secret from my pa\r\nI keep myself out of trouble, stay one step ahead of the law\r\nAnd I can keep it from my neighbors – it ain't like they even care\r\nBut I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs\r\nIt's the patronage of strangers that's keeping me from being broke\n\nBut when they hand over the paycheck to me, they have to wonder where it goes\n\nBecause I never seem to save it – I sure ain't wasting it on clothes, nor soap\n\nIt's a mystery to you but there's a guy at the store that knows\n\n\n\nBecause by eleven in the morning, I'll find him selling smokes\n\nLaughing in another language but we all know a joke's a joke\n\nThen by seven in the evening, I'm darkening the door\n\nLord, it's so hard trying to keep a secret in that god damn store\n\n\n\nHe's there to see me buying cigarettes – he's there to see me buying beer\n\nHe's never seen me on the internet and five o'clock is nowhere near\n\nBut every day can be the weekend if you can walk a couple floors, take that three story tour\n\nAnd make sure yr talking money when yr rocking with the boss at the store\n\nI'm rocking with the boss\n\n\n\nI can't keep a secret from the guy at the store\n\nI can't keep a secret, I couldn't lie anymore\n\nI can't keep a secret from the guy at the store\n\nWhy try like before?\n\n\n\nBecause you can lie with yr expression or lie with the things you say\n\nBut you can't lie with yr dollars, nah, babe – yr dollars, they give you away\n\nAnd the faces on the paper, the faces from the paper glare\n\nThat's why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs\n\n\n\nThe money in the pocket, there's a fire burning there\n\nThat's why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs\n\nIt's glaringly apparent why I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs\n\nSo why should I attempt it when I can't keep a secret from the guy at the store downstairs?",
