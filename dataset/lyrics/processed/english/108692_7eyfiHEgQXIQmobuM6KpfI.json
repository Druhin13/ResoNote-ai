  "lyrics": "So don't ask me how I've been cause I'll never be the same again \nAnd I won't play your stupid game this time because it's all pretend \nYou are chaos in disguise I knew better than to call a friend \nHow could I have been so blind how could I have let you in \nToo late I find \n\nThat it's not my state of mind \n\nI've been bled dry \n\nToo late I find \n\nThat it won't just take some time \n\nI've been \n\n\n\nI believed in the misery in me \n\nand it cost me all my dreams \n\nI believed in the misery in me \n\nLeft me shattered left me in incomplete \n\n\n\nnow I see through that disguise it couldn't end another way \n\nEverything that you despise was hidden in every word you'd say \n\nI have given up that life I wish it didn't end this way \n\nHow could I have been so blind how could I have let you in \n\n\n\nToo late I find \n\nThat it's not my state of mind I\n\nI've been bled dry \n\nToo late I find \n\nThat it won't just take some time \n\nI've been \n\n\n\nI believed in the misery in me \n\nand it cost me all my dreams \n\nI believed in the misery in me \n\nLeft me shattered left me in incomplete \n\n\n\nI believed in the misery in me \n\nand it cost me all my dreams \n\nI believed in the misery in me\n\nLeft me shattered left me in incomplete",
