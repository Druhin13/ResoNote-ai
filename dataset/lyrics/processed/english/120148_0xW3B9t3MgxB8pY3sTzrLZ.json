  "lyrics": "Comin' back from the country\r\nFor the good food and lousy beer\r\nThis winter's so dry\r\nAnd the dirt road so dusty\r\nAt the lightest fall of rain\r\nThe bacteria bloom\n\n\n\nYou don't have to be alone\n\nTo be lonesome\n\nIt's easy to forget\n\nThe sadness comes crashin'\n\nLike a brick through the window\n\nAnd it's Christmas\n\nSo no one can fix it\n\n\n\nTethered to a table\n\nWith that happy holiday crowd\n\nAnd it's anchors aweigh\n\nIt looks like smooth sailin'\n\nBut the merest hint of waves\n\nCould capsize you\n\n\n\nYou don't have to be alone\n\nTo be lonesome\n\nIt's easy to forget\n\nThe sadness comes crashin'\n\nLike a brick through the window\n\nAnd it's Christmas\n\nSo no one can fix it\n\n\n\nThe desire\n\nFor annihilation\n\nIs as common\n\nAs it is unkind\n\nAnd it's hard to recognize\n\nThe situation\n\nWhen you're desperately tryin'\n\nTo have a good time\n\n\n\nYou don't have to be alone\n\nTo be lonesome\n\nIt's so easy to forget\n\nThe sadness comes crashin'\n\nLike a brick through the window\n\nAnd it's Christmas\n\nSo no one can fix it\n\n\n\nYeah, it's Christmas\n\nSo no one can fix it",
