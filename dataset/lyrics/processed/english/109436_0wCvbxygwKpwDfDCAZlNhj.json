  "lyrics": "Jami was a good friend\r\nBack when we were kids and my father got sick\r\nWe would hang out on the weekends\r\nIn her house by the cathedral where all the good people\r\nGot dressed up on a Sunday\n\nTo go and spill their secrets no matter who the preacher was\n\nWe used to find that funny\n\nBut it's easy when you're young not to realize that you're lucky\n\n\n\nWhen the last of your friends are gone\n\nYou learn a whole lot about hanging on and on\n\nBut if you crash and nobody sees\n\nJust remember there will always be\n\nA room for you in my house in the trees\n\n\n\nAaron was a good friend\n\nWe were in our twenties, we drove across the country\n\nThen moved into the canyon\n\nAnd he looked after the business the year that I got sick\n\nThen we went off in different directions\n\nKept in touch but it never was the same\n\nI never got to thank him\n\nBut I wrote it in a letter\n\nI'm sure I'll send it someday\n\n\n\nWhen the last of your friends are gone\n\nYou learn a whole lot about hanging on and on\n\nBut if you crash and nobody sees\n\nJust remember there will always be\n\nA room for you in my house in the trees\n\nTrees\n\n\n\nI am a lucky man\n\nI have been so many places\n\nWhen I dream it seems I'm chasing\n\nA bittersweet, bittersweet, bittersweet memories\n\n\n\nWhen the last of your friends are gone\n\nYou learn a whole lot about hanging on and on\n\nBut if you crash and nobody sees\n\nJust remember there will always be\n\nA room for you in my house in the trees\n\nTrees\n\nMy house in the trees\n\nTrees\n\nMy house in the trees\n\nTrees",
