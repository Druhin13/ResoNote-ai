  "lyrics": "Time revealed what's underneath your skin\r\nYou only cared when the floor caved in\r\nYou know that I, I'd look for a reason\r\nBut it just starts arguments\r\nI'm the candle when your lights burn out\n\nYour assurance in the face of doubt\n\nYou pull me like a ripcord\n\nIgnored, you're selfish 'til you need me more\n\nNow all our trust is gone\n\nSo if we fall through the ground, right now\n\nThe consequences still roll out\n\nWhere all our trust is gone\n\nSeems strong to carry on\n\n\n\nWith what I said\n\nI tore into your skin\n\nMend your wounds, while I stitch my lips\n\nIt only hurts when the words sink in\n\nIt only hurts when the words sink in\n\nHere we are again, 2 corners different ends\n\nHope it's a season, but it's likely permanent\n\n\n\nI'm the candle when your lights burn out\n\nYour assurance in the face of doubt\n\nYou pull me like a ripcord\n\nIgnored, you're selfish 'til you need me more\n\nNow all our trust is gone\n\nSo if we fall through the ground, right now\n\nThe consequences still roll out\n\nWhere all our trust is gone\n\nSeems strong to carry on\n\n\n\nYou wear a mask when I'm around\n\nYou lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out\n\nCan't put out\n\nYou wear a mask when I'm around\n\nYou lit a fire that my night sweats can't put out (can't put it out)\n\nI can't put it out\n\nNow all our trust is gone\n\n\n\nYou pull me like a ripcord\n\nSecured, I was hoping that you'd need me more\n\nNow all our trust is gone\n\nSo if we fall through the ground, right now\n\nI'm OK with how things will turn out\n\nYou're gone, seems strong to carry on",
