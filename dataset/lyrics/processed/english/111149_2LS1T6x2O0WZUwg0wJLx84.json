  "lyrics": "I set a watch for 5 o'clock\r\nI think of trees and rivers as I'm drifting off\r\nI pinch my wrist (just to tell where I am)\r\nI get a twinge (seems as real as it can)\r\nBut I remain and so I know the rest is up to me\n\nAt night, the sunlight beats upon my skin\n\nIn here, I see everything\n\nAnd until the morning comes\n\nI feel it\n\n\n\nAll my life I tried\n\nTo find the time to make believe\n\nBut now as certain as the seasons\n\nI know real life will get in between\n\nIf I never get to decide my reality\n\nAt least I see how it could be\n\nWhen I get round to sleeping (sleeping), dreaming (dreaming)\n\nWorks for me\n\n\n\nAnd though my soul (lets me do what I want)\n\nIs pretty bold (in a place I belong)\n\nFrom time to time, my grip'll slip\n\nAnd I just lose control\n\nThen awake I freeze\n\nBut nothing in my head can hurt me\n\nHowever real it seems\n\n\n\nAll my life I tried\n\nTo find the time to make believe\n\nBut now as certain as the seasons\n\nI know real life will get in between\n\nIf I never get to decide my reality\n\nAt least I see how it could be\n\nWhen I get round to sleeping (sleeping), dreaming (dreaming)\n\nWhen I get round to sleeping (sleeping), dreaming (dreaming)\n\nOh",
