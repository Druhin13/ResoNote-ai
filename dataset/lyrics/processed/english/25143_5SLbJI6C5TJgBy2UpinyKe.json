  "lyrics": "You pulled the hammer from the cupboard\r\nIn the Sunday best you’d wear\r\nYou spoke your vows into a bottle\r\nStalked his footsteps up the stairs\r\nThere’s no living in the present\n\nWe are alive beyond repair\n\n\n\nBlanking at your own reflection\n\nDespondent as you stare\n\n\n\nYou pulled the hammer from the cupboard\n\nFilled your ashtray up with prayer\n\nYou hid your bruises in the plaster\n\nWith a brand new cross to bear\n\n\n\nPour your heart across the floorboards, too broken to care\n\nYour hands, they trembled\n\nClutched around your ticket out\n\nThere’s no resemblance of the face you used to know\n\n\n\nSo pour your heart across the floorboards, too broken to care\n\nNails, nails, nails everywhere\n\nNails, nails everywhere\n\nNails, nails, nails everywhere\n\nNails, nails everywhere",
