  "lyrics": "Do you need, do you need someone?\r\nAre you scared of what's to come?\r\nIf you leave then who will the next one be?\r\nWill he do the same or will he let you see?\r\nYou don't have to hurt, you don't have to hurt anymore\n\nWith a little time, take a look and find what you're searching for\n\n\n\nYou are broken on the floor\n\nAnd you're crying, crying\n\nHe has done this all before\n\nBut you're lying, lying\n\nTo yourself, that he'll find help\n\nThat he will change to someone else\n\nBut you're broken on the floor\n\nStill, asking him for more\n\n\n\nWill you leave or will you carry on?\n\nIs your love from before still strong?\n\nIf you leave, will you keep the memory\n\nThat made night so long, that cut so deep?\n\n\n\nYou don't have to hurt, you don't have to hurt anymore\n\nWith a little time, take a look and find what you're searching for\n\n\n\nYou are broken on the floor\n\nAnd you're crying, crying\n\nHe has done this all before\n\nBut you're lying, lying\n\nTo yourself, that he'll find help\n\nThat he will change to someone else\n\nBut you're broken on the floor\n\nStill, asking him for more\n\n\n\nAsking him for more\n\nAsking him for more\n\n\n\nYou are broken on the floor\n\nAnd you're crying, crying\n\nHe has done this all before\n\nBut you're lying, lying\n\nTo yourself, that he'll find help\n\nThat he will change to someone else\n\nBut you're broken on the floor\n\nStill, asking him for more\n\n\n\nAsking him for more (more)\n\nStill, asking him... for more",
