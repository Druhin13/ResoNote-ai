  "lyrics": "I don't want a lot for Christmas\r\nThere is just one thing I need\r\nI don't care about the presents\r\nUnderneath the Christmas tree\r\nI don't need to hang my stocking\r\nThere upon the fireplace\n\nSanta Claus won't make me happy\n\nWith a toy on Christmas Day\n\n\n\nI just want you for my own\n\nMore than you could ever know\n\nMake my wish come true\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you\n\n\n\nI won't ask for much this Christmas\n\nI won't even wish for snow\n\nI'm just gonna keep on waiting\n\nUnderneath the mistletoe\n\nI won't make a list and send it\n\nTo the North Pole for Saint Nick\n\nI won't even stay awake to\n\nHear those magic reindeer click\n\n\n\nI just want you here tonight\n\nHolding on to me so tight\n\nWhat more can I do?\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you\n\n\n\nAll I really want, all I really want\n\nAll I really want\n\n\n\nAll the lights are shining\n\nSo brightly everywhere (so brightly everywhere)\n\nAnd the sound of children\n\nLaughter fills the air\n\nAnd everyone is singing\n\nI hear those sleigh bells ringing\n\nSanta won't you bring me\n\nThe one I really need?\n\n\n\nI don't want a lot for Christmas\n\nThis is all I'm asking for\n\nI just wanna see my baby\n\nRight outside my door\n\n\n\nI just want you for my own\n\nMore than you could ever know\n\nMake my wish come true (make my wish come true)\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you\n\nAll I want for Christmas\n\nAll I want is you\n\nAll I want is you",
