  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Come Alive par Years & Years\r\n[Olly Alexander]\nYou stumble through your days\nGot your head hung low, your skies a shade of grey\nLike a zombie in a maze\nYou're asleep inside, but you can shake awake\n\n[Olly Alexander]\n'Cause you're just a dead man walking\nThinking that's your only option\nBut you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day\nSun is up and the color's blinding\nTake the world and redefine it\nLeave behind your narrow mind\nYou'll never be the same\n\n\n[Olly Alexander]\nCome alive, come alive\nGo and light your light, let it burn so bright\nReaching up to the sky\nAnd it's open wide, you're electrified\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nAnd you know you can't go back again\nTo the world that you were living in\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nSo, come alive\n\n[Jess Glynne]\nOh ah, yeah\nI see it in your eyes\nYou believe that lie that you need to hide your face\n\nAfraid to step outside\nSo you lock the door, but don't you stay that way\n\n[Jess Glynne]\nNo more living in those shadows\nYou and me, we know how that goes\n'Cause once you see it all, you'll never, never be the same\nLittle bit of lightnin' striking\nBottle up to keep on shining\n'Cause you can prove there's more to you\nYou cannot be afraid\n\n[Olly Alexander & Jess Glynne]\nCome alive, come alive\nGo and light your light, let it burn so bright\nReaching up to the sky\nAnd it's open wide, you're electrified\n\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nAnd you know you can't go back again\nTo the world that you were living in\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nSo, come alive\n\n[ Jess Glynne]\nCome one, come all, come in, come on\nTo anyone who's bursting with a dream\nCome one, come all, you hear the call\nTo anyone who's searching for a way to break free\n\n[Olly Alexander & Jess Glynne, (Jess, Olly)]\nCome alive, come alive (Come alive)\nGo and light your light, let it burn so bright (Go and light your light)\n\nReaching up to the sky (Reaching up to the sky, yeah)\nAnd it's open wide, you're electrified\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\n(Dreaming with your eyes wide open)\nAnd you know you can't go back again (Go back again)\nTo the world that you were living in (No no no no)\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nSo, come alive\nWhen the world becomes a fantasy (Oh, a fantasy)\nAnd you're more than you could ever be\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\n(You're dreaming with your eyes wide open)\nAnd you know you can't go back again\n\nTo the world that we were living in\n'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open\nSo come alive",
