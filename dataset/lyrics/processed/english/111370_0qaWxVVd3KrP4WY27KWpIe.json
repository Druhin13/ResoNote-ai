  "lyrics": "Slide into the cool mud\r\nUnderneath the pines\r\nSomewhere to your right or left\r\nIs my body you can find\r\nWe are swimming with no clothes on\n\nIn a river in the dark\n\nAnd I am holding on to you, boy\n\nIn the faint light of the stars\n\n\n\nSo you wade out across the marsh\n\nWater up to your waist\n\nCarry our stuff above your head\n\nTill the dune comes to a crest\n\n\n\nWe are swimming with no clothes on\n\nIn a river in the dark\n\nAnd I am holding on to you, boy\n\nIn the faint light of the stars\n\n\n\nBut sometimes I feel it\n\nIn a dream I know I've been there\n\nWe were sleeping by the ocean\n\nWe were laughing on the warm sand\n\nWe stay up all night\n\nAnd we wake up in the sunlight\n\nWe got dreams we keep together\n\nWe got time to spend, oh, hell yeah\n\n\n\nWe are swimming with no clothes on\n\nIn a river in the dark\n\nAnd I am holding on to you, boy\n\nIn the faint light of the stars\n\n\n\nWe are lying\n\nOn the beach now\n\nEverything is warm\n\nWe are staying up\n\nThrough a wild night\n\nIn the faint light\n\nOf the headlights\n\nOf passing cars",
