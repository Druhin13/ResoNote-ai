  "lyrics": "Towing the line\r\nI watched the host drink all the wine\r\nAnd now she rambles through the new of minds\r\nThe old man is a painter\r\nOf tired seascapes\r\nTired of adventure\n\nSo my mind wanders\n\nPicking at the table\n\nTo cure the wrong\n\nLike a bird in a world with no trees\n\nYou were hung up there in your disbelief\n\nI know i'm a hard rock to drag around\n\n\n\nLove is in the early mornings\n\nIn the shadows under the trees\n\nNot in like the colded ashes\n\nFloating down from the rook array\n\n\n\nDown here I crow for you\n\nYou crow for me Down here\n\nI crow for you\n\nYou crow for me\n\n\n\nTowing the line\n\nI watched the host drink all the wine\n\nAnd now I’m purring\n\nFor a drop of anything\n\nThrowing stones at your window\n\nYou telling me as if it’s simple\n\nWhy can’t you be like the blackbird and sing\n\nI said I’m the westerlies in Ireland\n\nSo decadent and violent\n\nCan’t you see I’m a forager\n\nCrawling at the bedrock\n\n\n\nLove is in the early mornings\n\nIn the shadows under the trees\n\nNot in like the colded ashes\n\nFloating down from the rook array\n\n\n\nDown here I crow for you\n\nYou crow for me\n\nDown here I crow for you\n\nYou crow for me",
