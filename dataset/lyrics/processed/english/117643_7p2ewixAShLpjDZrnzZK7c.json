Might as well spit in my food\n\nBitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool\n\nWent from making tuna sandwiches to making the news\n\nI started speaking my mind and tripled my views\n\nReal bitch, only thing fake is the boobs\n\nGet money, go hard, you're motherfucking right\n\nNever been no fraud in my motherfucking life\n\nGet money, go hard, damn fucking right\n\nStunt on these bitches out of motherfucking spite\n\nAin't no running up on me, went from nothing to glory\n\nI ain't telling ya to do it, I'm just telling my story\n\nI don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny\n\nAnd I got enough bras, ya ain't gotta support me\n\nI went from rag to riches, went from way too lit, nigga\n\nOnly person in my fam to see six figures\n\nThe pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders\n\nWhen you gotta make sure that everybody straight\n\nBitches stab you in your back while they smiling in your face\n\nTalking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case\n\nI waited my whole life just to shit on niggas\n\nClimb to the top floor so I can spit on niggas\n\nSaid \"I was just trying to chill and make bangers\"\n\nTell all these old bitches they in danger\n\nThe thing on my hip whip bitches in to shape\n\nThat's what I call a fucking waist trainer\n\nYou gon' run up on who and do what?\n\nI think ya got your story screwed up\n\nI came here to ball, is you nuts?\n\nI don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough\n\nI'm the one that's killing shit, hands down\n\nIf you got a problem with me, say it now\n\n'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissing\n\n'Specially not from one you weak bitches\n\nI'm on the go like I don't see no stop lights\n\nI'm stepping out every day, prom night\n\nSo if it's all love, show me love then\n\n'Cause you hating on a bitch, that's what it sounds like\n\nBeast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga\n\nHoodie low, that's how I'm pulling up\n\nJust 'cause I been on the road, don't mean I been on the run\n\nAnd you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun\n\nAnd we all know you ain't that tight\n\nI smack you and the bitch that you act like\n\nI started getting money, bitches upset\n\nThey remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight\n\nNails done, hair lit, keep them both laced\n\nCome through shinning with them Rollies bust face\n\nHeadshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case\n\nAin't no bitches spittin' like this since 08'\n\nI don't trust no nigga, I don't feel no bitch\n\nWhole life been through some fucked up shit\n\nThey say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this\n\nWhen you seen what I've seen, you end up like this\n\nI walked into the label, \"where the check at?\"\n\nCardi B on the charts, you can expect that\n\nWhere that bitch that was claiming she a threat?\n\nI'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at\n\nThey say, I'm too ratchet\n\nThey say, I act wild\n\nI'm Chyna wit' the porn\n\nLike a bad ass child\n\nThey caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now\n\nCardi B, know it's me\n\nHear that \"blap\" sound (Blap!)\n\n\n\nMan, I said we gon' win\n\nKnock me down nine times, but I get up ten\n\nLook myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win\n\nKnock me down nine times, but I get up ten\n\nLook myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win\n\nKnock me down nine times, but I get up ten\n\nYeah, but I get up ten\n\nKnock me down nine times, but I get up ten\n\nBitch\n\n\n\nI'ma make a fuck nigga feel me\n\nSaid I'ma do a broke bitch filthy\n\nI'ma make a fuck nigga feel me\n\nI'ma do a broke bitch filthy\n\n\n\nWe gon' win\n\nKnock me down nine times, but I get up ten\n\nYeah\n\nI said we gon' win\n\nKnock me down nine times, but I get up ten\n\nBitch!",
