  "lyrics": "Moved out to Topanga, now I’m livin’ with God\r\nMy life was in danger from the path I was on\r\nNow every inch of salvation, you know I’m gonna travel\r\nI’m escaping to the place where all the judges lost their gavels, singin’\r\nWhere you been? Where you at?\n\nEverything I did, I can take it back\n\nI can’t move on, I can’t relax\n\n’Cause when you’re gone... panic attacks\n\nThinking of you lying down when I was faking sleep\n\nFaking sleep when I was lying down thinking of you\n\n\n\nStarted taking pills and now I’m livin’ alright\n\nBesides the constant numbness and the thoughts of suicide\n\nNow all the butterflies have turned to vultures in my stomach We’re just birds up on a wire playing who’s the first to plummet\n\n\n\nWhere you been? Where you at?\n\nEverything I did, I can take it back\n\nI can’t move on, I can’t relax\n\n’Cause when you’re gone... panic attacks\n\n\n\nWhere you been? Where you at?\n\nEverything I did, I can take it back\n\nI can’t move on, I can’t relax\n\n’Cause when you’re gone... panic attacks\n\nThinking of you lying down when I was faking sleep\n\nFaking sleep when I was lying down thinking of you\n\n\n\nEverything is nothing, nothing’s everything to me\n\nNothing’s everything, everything’s everything, you see\n\n\n\nWhere you been? Where you at?\n\nEverything I did, I can take it back\n\nI can’t move on, I can’t relax\n\n’Cause when you're gone... panic attacks\n\nPanic attacks\n\n’Cause when you're gone... panic attacks\n\n\n\nMoved out to Topanga, now I’m livin’ with God",
