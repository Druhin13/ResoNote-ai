(calling me)\n\nUh, come get some of what you need (what you need)\n\n\n\nFrom the bottom of your soul\n\n\n\nShame, shame, shame, shame\n\nMama doesn't know, ooh\n\nEvery night you go to\n\nShame, shame, shame, shame\n\nThere a woman wants to roll, ooh\n\nI can make you shake\n\nRight through your bones\n\n\n\nYou can live forever, babe\n\nWalk with me in shadows\n\nI can make you better, babe\n\nCome pray with me, get safe with me\n\n\n\nShame, shame, shame, shame\n\nMama doesn't know, ooh\n\nEvery night you go to\n\nShame, shame, shame, shame\n\nThere a woman wants to roll, ooh\n\nI can make you shake\n\nShame, shame, shame, shame\n\nMama doesn't know, ooh\n\nEvery night you go to\n\nShame, shame, shame, shame\n\nThere a woman wants to roll, ooh\n\nI can make you shake\n\nRight through your bones",
