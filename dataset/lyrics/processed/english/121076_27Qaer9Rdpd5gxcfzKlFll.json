  "lyrics": "I can't see your star.\r\nI can't see your star.\r\nThough I patiently waited, bedside, for the death of today.\r\nI can't see your star.\r\nThe mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away.\n\nAnd I'm alone now,\n\nMe and all I stood for.\n\nWe're wandering now.\n\nAll in parts in pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out.\n\n\n\nI can't see your star.\n\nI can't see your star.\n\nHow can the darkness feel so wrong?\n\n\n\nAnd I'm alone now,\n\nMe and all I stood for.\n\nWe're wandering now.\n\nAll in parts in pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out.\n\n\n\nSo far away.\n\nIt's growing colder without your love.\n\nWhy can't you feel me calling your name?\n\nCan't break the silence,\n\nIt's breaking me.\n\n\n\nAll my fears turn to rage.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm alone now, me\n\nAnd all I stood for.\n\nWe're wandering now.\n\nAll in parts and pieces, swim lonely, find your own way out",
