  "lyrics": "Forever betrayed, we stand at the edge\r\nOurselves are to blame, there's no turning back\r\nWe buy into this madness\r\nWaste every resource and remain mindless\r\nWe stand and watch the world decay\n\nLiving a lie as we're wasting away\n\nThere's no measure of control\n\nNo concept of what we hold\n\nWe've bled our future dry and there's no one else left to blame\n\n\n\nIn this mindless paradigm\n\nWe can only decline\n\nOur future's being sold by the hands of greed\n\nBut what is the real cost?\n\n\n\nWatch as we all collapse\n\nI tell you that we've lost our way\n\nUnder the dying sun\n\nWatch as we all collapse\n\nWatch as we all collapse\n\n\n\nSedated masses swallow headlines over and over again\n\nSo consumed in the mundane, there's no way for us to maintain\n\nThis vicious cycle is spinning out of control\n\nWe're left dead behind the eyes and there's no one else left to blame\n\n\n\nIn this mindless paradigm\n\nWe can only decline\n\nOur future's being sold by the hands of greed\n\nBut what is the real cost?\n\n\n\nWatch as we all collapse\n\nI tell you that we've lost our way\n\nUnder the dying sun\n\nWatch as we all collapse\n\nUnder the dying sun\n\nWatch as we all collapse\n\n\n\nStaring at the end, a future obsolete\n\nWe're only living to consume ourselves\n\n\n\nIn this mindless paradigm\n\nWe can only decline\n\nIn this mindless paradigm\n\nWe can only decline\n\nIn this mindless paradigm\n\nWe can only decline",
