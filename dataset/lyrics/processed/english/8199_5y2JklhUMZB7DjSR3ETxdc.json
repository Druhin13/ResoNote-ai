Crew (uh)\n\nI was on the dank, they was on K2 (uh)\n\nThey was moving eights, I had eight full\n\nPounds of the raw, hand it off, make 3 points or ounce it out and get yours\n\nGive 'em a couple grams over, they gon' feel you\n\nCan't give you all of this game, might have to kill you\n\nBarbecue and mildew, you know you done fucked up right? Where's Bill Duke\n\nFake nigga, no matter how you dress it up, it's still you\n\nMake 'em disappear, I'm skillful\n\nWatch 'em appear, under my (?)\n\nCan't even trust niggas be out to get you\n\nDon't let your last meal be the hand that fed you\n\nMy Mexican homie flip the work good, he used to wrestle\n\nShit got hot over there he had to refuge\n\n\n\nReal hate over fake love, any day\n\nReal hate over fake love, any day\n\n\n\nEvery man at your man, like every chick ain't your chick\n\nUnderstand where we stand, you can't sit where we sit\n\nWe started off hand in hand, then moved to brick after brick\n\nYou a fan or you fam, y'all niggas quick to forget\n\nDrug dealers scouting like, \"Who got it to send it out?\"\n\nBreaking down the ounces, make samples and give it out\n\nLive in the mountains, phone service be in out\n\nBag full of birds, the only way we could chicken out\n\nTry to manage your vibe energy\n\nA fake friend could do more damage than five enemies\n\nBarely see me with beef, like fried Kennedy\n\nBut bring your instrument, we could have us a live symphony\n\nIn a tight alley, weed be like Cali's\n\nGunplay scenes, I squeeze like Mike Lowry\n\nAll you see is sticks and signs, a light rally\n\nRed track suit, new Swizz beat, white Bally's (Vado)\n\n\n\nReal hate over fake love, any day (Uh-huh. uh, uh, uh)\n\nReal hate over fake love, any day",
