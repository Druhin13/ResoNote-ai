  "lyrics": "You walk away\r\nYou think I can't hear a thing you say\r\nWhy don't you say it to my face?\r\nWhy can't you just be real?\r\nMy dear friend\r\nWhy must you insist we pretend\n\nThat you don't wish that I was dead?\n\nI know that’s how you feel\n\n\n\nYou're a lion, but you dress up like a sheep\n\nAnd you think you're foolin' me, but you ain't foolin' me\n\nYou're a sinner, but you're actin' like a saint\n\nAnd you think you're foolin me, but you ain't\n\n\n\nYou attack\n\nYou twist the knife into my back\n\nWhere you hold me close and whisper that\n\nI mean the world to you\n\nI've since learned\n\nOf all of the bridges that you've burned\n\nAll of the friends that drop like birds\n\nWhen you take aim and shoot\n\n\n\nYou're a lion, but you dressed up like a sheet\n\nAnd you think you're foolin' me, but you ain't foolin' me\n\nYou're a sinner, but you're actin' like a saint\n\nOh, you think you're foolin me, but you ain't\n\n\n\nYou're a lion, but you dressed up like a sheet\n\nAnd you think you're foolin' me, but you ain't foolin' me\n\nYou're a sinner, but you're actin' like a saint\n\nOh, you think you're foolin me, but you ain’t\n\nOh, you think you're foolin me, but you ain’t",
