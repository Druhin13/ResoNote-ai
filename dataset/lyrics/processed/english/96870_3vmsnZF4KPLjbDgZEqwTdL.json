  "lyrics": "I'm in shambles since I blew my 16th candle\r\nIt's the little things that I can't handle\r\nAnd we're still in July\r\nCall me or reach me 'cause I need samples\r\nA newspapes with no more scandals\r\nSome loose change with no more vandals\n\nCan I get up out my mind?\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, I know my world's burning down\n\nWhere to run? Who to call?\n\nEven though my world's burning down\n\nI know I can get through the fall\n\n\n\n'Cause life must go on (Go, go on)\n\nOne blink, then it's all gone\n\nI said life must go on (Go, go on)\n\nEven when you know it's all wrong\n\nWhether you're high, whether you're low\n\nGotta keep on, be a part of the show\n\nI said life must go on (Go, go on)\n\nGo on, and you know I got you\n\n\n\nIn my mind, in the chemistry that I combine sits\n\nA melody that's singing, \"You're not fine\"\n\nBut they can't hear me out\n\nSo I'm in a rapid conversation\n\nTo know if this is any normal sensation\n\nThe internet's saying I'm temptatious\n\nAnd they can't hear me shout\n\n\n\nAnd yeah, I know my world's burning down\n\nWhere to run? Who to call?\n\nEven though my world's burning down\n\nI know I can get through the fall\n\n\n\n'Cause life must go on (Go, go on)\n\nOne blink, then it's all gone\n\nI said life must go on (Go, go on)\n\nEven when you know it's all wrong\n\nWhether you're high, whether you're low\n\nGotta keep on, be a part of the show\n\nI said life must go on (Go, go on)\n\nGo on, and you know I got you\n\n\n\nEverything keeps on changing and I'm caught in the middle\n\nI just keep getting anxious, yeah, I'm caught in the middle\n\nTrouble turning these pages, yeah, I'm caught in the middle\n\n\n\n'Cause life must go on\n\nOne blink, then it's all gone\n\nI said life must go on\n\nEven when you know it's all wrong\n\nWhether you're high, whether you're low\n\nGotta keep on, be a part of the show\n\nI said life must go on (Yeah)\n\nGo on, and you know I got you\n\nLife must go on (Life goes on)\n\nOne blink, then it's all gone (All gone)\n\nI said life must go on (Go on)\n\nEven when you know it's all wrong\n\nSo whether you're high, whether you're low\n\nGotta keep on, be a part of the show\n\nI said life must go on (Life goes on)\n\nGo on, and you know I got you\n\n\n\nWhether you're high, whether you're low\n\nGotta keep on, be a part of the show\n\nI said life must go on\n\nGo on, and you know I got you",
