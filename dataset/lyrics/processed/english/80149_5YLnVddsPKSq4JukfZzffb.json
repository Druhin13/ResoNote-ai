  "lyrics": "She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati\rOn a snow white Christmas Eve\rGoing home to see her Mama and her Daddy with the baby in the backseat\rFifty miles to go and she was running low on faith and gasoline\rIt's been a long hard year\rShe had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention\rShe was going way to fast\rBefore she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass\rShe saw both their lives flash before her eyes\rShe didn't even have time to cry\rShe was sooo scared\rShe threw her hands up in the air\rJesus take the wheel\rTake it from my hands\rCause I can't do this all on my own\rI'm letting go\rSo give me one more chance\rTo save me from this road I'm on\rJesus take the wheel\rIt was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder\rAnd the car came to a stop\rShe cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock\rAnd for the first time in a long time\rShe bowed her head to pray\rShe said I'm sorry for the way\rI've been living my life\rI know I've got to change\rSo from now on tonight\rJesus take the wheel\rTake it from my hands\rCause I can't do this on my own\rI'm letting go\rSo give me one more chance\rTo save me from this road I'm on\rOh, Jesus take the wheel\rOh, I'm letting go\rSo give me one more chance\rSave me from this road I'm on\rFrom this road I'm on\rJesus take the wheel\rOh, take it, take it from me\rOh, why, oh",
