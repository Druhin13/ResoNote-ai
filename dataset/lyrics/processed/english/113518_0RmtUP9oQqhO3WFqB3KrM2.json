  "lyrics": "Are you sitting at home all alone trying to fall asleep?\r\nAre you staring a hole through your phone praying that it rings?\r\nAre you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?\r\nMaybe playing some Mayer getting lost in your favorite lines?\r\nIf you're anything like me\n\nYou just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise\n\nBut I just wanna hear your voice\n\n\n\nAnd I'm one number away from calling to you\n\nI said I was through, but I'm dying, inside\n\nGot my head in a mess, girl I confess\n\nI lied when I said, \"I'm leaving and not coming back\"\n\nMight be the whiskey or the midnight rain\n\nBut everywhere I go I see your face\n\nIn my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say\n\nBut I'm still one number away\n\n\n\nAre you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?\n\nDoes the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?\n\nAre you changing the station replacing our favorite song?\n\nMaybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes, I'm moving on\n\n\n\nIf you're anything like me\n\nYou just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm\n\nBut I'm almost out that door\n\n\n\nAnd I'm one number away from calling to you\n\nI said I was through, but I'm dying, inside\n\nGot my head in a mess, girl, I confess\n\nI lied when I said, \"I'm leaving and not coming back\"\n\nMight be the whiskey or the midnight rain\n\nBut everywhere I go I see your face\n\nIn my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say\n\nBut I'm still one number away\n\n\n\nWill you pick up when I call?\n\nOr just forget we loved at all?\n\nWe don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice\n\n\n\nAnd I'm one number away from calling to you\n\nI said I was through, but I'm dying, inside\n\nGot my head in a mess, girl, I confess\n\nI lied when I said, \"I'm leaving and not coming back\"\n\nMight be the whiskey or the midnight rain\n\nBut everywhere I go I see your face\n\nIn my brain, dial it up, anything I want to say\n\nBut I'm still one number away\n\nAway\n\nAway\n\nYea I'm still one number away",
