We not new to it\r\nWe countin' fluent\r\nI'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud\n\nI came out the hood\n\nSometimes a gangsta need a hug\n\nI'ma give all my problems above\n\nHate when people keep doin' too much\n\nKeep it real, the streets show you no love\n\n\n\nWe don't need no one vouchin' for us\n\nI've been grindin' and found me a bust\n\nI've been searchin' for love and found lust\n\nIt's so hard to stop holdin' a grudge\n\nMy lil' dawg split your shit like a Dutch\n\nMy whole squad kept the kid in the cut\n\nKeep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough\n\nPick and chose who the right one to trust\n\nPick and chose who the right one to trust\n\nKeep it real it's a lot fake love\n\nNiggas hate but they bitches in love\n\nAnd the Bentley all white like a dove\n\nI took off, ate this Xan, means it works\n\nKicked her out, told her walk to the burbs\n\nI'm a sipper, can tell when it's cut\n\nYou can't tell me that she ain't a slut\n\n\n\nWho you think you foolin'? We not new to it\n\nWe countin' fluent\n\nI'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud\n\nI came out the hood\n\nSometimes a gangsta need a hug\n\nI'ma give all my problems above\n\nHate when people keep doin' too much\n\nKeep it real, the streets show you no love\n\n\n\nI don't need no one vouchin' for me\n\nI be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth\n\nCar push-start, I keep losin' the keys\n\nChanel, Boss my closet full of C's\n\nMy shit wet Eliantte, VVs\n\nI got pearls 'round my neck, not no beads\n\nI get cash in my bag while I'm sleep\n\nNew blue face, two-tone Patek Philippe\n\nBeverly Center, shoppin' spree on me\n\nNew agenda, don't do nothin' free\n\nAin't not one of my foreigns on E\n\nAll my bitches got expensive weave\n\nI sip drank for my pain to get eased\n\nI still talk to the Lord on my knees\n\nHelpin' me take care all of my needs\n\nAnd we take off the top for a breeze\n\n\n\nWho you think you foolin'? We not new to it\n\nWe countin' fluent\n\nI'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud\n\nI came out the hood\n\nSometimes a gangsta need a hug\n\nI'ma give all my problems above\n\nHate when people keep doin' too much\n\nKeep it real, the streets show you no love",
