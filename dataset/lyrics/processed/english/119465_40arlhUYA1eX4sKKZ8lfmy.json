  "lyrics": "Happening now, TBI investigators remain on the scene of a death investigation out in Cheatham County\r\n19 miles from the music city lights\r\nWhere the people bring guns to big knife fights\r\nAnd the sheriff don't care so don't try to call\r\nHe might be in ties with the man on the farm\n\nUncle Red's on the rye and he's lost in the field\n\nTrying to dodge the thunder that keeps striking these hills\n\n\n\nThe road I'm on has no yellow lines\n\nJust cracked asphalt and broken signs\n\nThe potholes filled with THC\n\nWhen the streetlights disappear you're on the creek\n\n\n\nPond creek road\n\nPond creek road\n\nPond creek road\n\nPond creek road\n\n\n\nThese bridges are tattooed in John Deere green. Jaybirds looks like something from a movie scene\n\nAnd i know who's dangerous and who's insane\n\nWho's got the blue flame and Mary Jane\n\n\n\nThe road I'm on has no yellow lines\n\nJust cracked asphalt and broken signs\n\nThe potholes filled with THC\n\nWhen the streetlights disappear you're on the creek\n\n\n\nThe road I'm on is a place I know\n\nThe big white church with a haunted cove\n\nThe black marks lead into another lifetime\n\nIn the side of a tall pine\n\n\n\nThe road I'm on has no yellow lines\n\nJust cracked asphalt and broken signs\n\nThe potholes filled with THC\n\nWhen the streetlights disappear you're on the creek\n\n\n\nPond creek road\n\nPond creek road\n\nPond creek road\n\nPond creek road\n\n\n\nAnd investigators say there are currently a lot of unanswered questions",
