  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Egg & Daughter Nite, Lincoln Nebraska, 1967 (Crazy Bone) par John Prine\r\nIf you like your apples sweet\nAnd your streets are not concrete\nYou'll be in your bed by nine every night\nTake your hand-spanked, corn-fed gal\nAnd your best friend's four-eyed pal\nTo a treat right down the street that's dynamite\nLet your conscience be your guide\nIf you put your foot inside\nYou wish you left your well-enough alone\nWhen you got hell to pay\nPut the truth on layaway\nAnd blame it on that ole' crazy bone\n\nCrazy bone (crazy bone)\nCrazy bone (crazy bone)\nWell you wish you'd left your well-enough alone\n\nWhen you got hell to pay\nPut the truth on layaway\nAnd blame it on the ole' crazy bone\n\nDon't be stuck up in Alaska\nWhen you should be in Nebraska\nOn a Thursday when it's Egg & Daughter Nite\nWhen the farmers come to town\nAnd they spread them eggs around\nAnd they drop their daughters down at the roller rink\nWell you're prob'ly standin' there\nWith your slicked-back, Brylcreem hair\nYour Lucky's and your daddy's fine-tooth comb\nIf they knew what you were thinkin'\nThey'd run you out of Lincoln\nJust blame it on that ole' crazy bone\n\n\nCrazy bone (crazy bone)\nCrazy bone (crazy bone)\nWell you must have left your wisdom tooth at home\nIf they knew what you were thinkin'\nThey'd run you out of Lincoln\nBlame it on the ole' crazy bone\n\nWhen the grandkids all are grown\nAnd they put you in a home\nAnd eternity is approachin' fast\nYeah you're half out of your head\nAnd you prob'ly pissed the bed\nAnd you can't see a thing to save your ass\nAnd far across the prairie (prairie)\nIn the local cemetery ('tery)\nThey already got your name carved out in stone\nWhen all them nurses say\n\"Grandpa why you walk that way?\"\n\nJust blame it on that ole' crazy bone\nYeah blame it on that ole' ...\n\nCrazy bone (crazy bone)\nCrazy bone (crazy bone)\nAnd everybody in that old folks' home\nIf they knew what you were thinkin'\nThey'd run you out of Lincoln\nJust blame it on that ole' crazy bone\nAnd everybody in that old folks' home\nYeah blame it on that ole' crazy bone",
