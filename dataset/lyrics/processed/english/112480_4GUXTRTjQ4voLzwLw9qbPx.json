  "lyrics": "It’s the sick to your stomach feeling with a smile on your face\r\nIt’s the memory you ignore, but you can’t erase\r\nIt’s the text in the middle of the night you didn’t ask for\r\nIt can help your career, but at what cost?\r\nAre you holding back something that you’re dying to say?\n\nMe, too\n\nGirl, I believe you\n\nAre you losing your mind thinking what will it take\n\nTo make somebody listen to you?\n\nMe, too\n\n\n\nIt’s the room full of rumors and everybody starin’\n\nDid they tell you you were asking for it by what you were wearin’?\n\nIt’s the stains from your makeup and tears on your pillow\n\nIt’s a piece of yourself that you let go\n\nDo you wanna scream but just can’t find the air?\n\n\n\nMe, too\n\nGirl, I believe you\n\nAre you losing your mind thinking what will it take\n\nTo make somebody listen to you?\n\nMe, too\n\n\n\nThey say step up and sit down\n\nShut up and back down\n\nSo what’s up, yeah, what’s up with that?\n\nSo we dress up, get felt up\n\nGet shot down, don’t speak up\n\nYeah, what's up, yeah, what's up with that?\n\nAre you holding back something\n\nThat you’ve just been dying to say?\n\n\n\nMe, too\n\nGirl, I believe you\n\nDo you know every battle that you've had to face\n\nIs making you bulletproof?\n\nMe, too\n\n\n\nMe, too\n\nGirl, I believe you\n\nDo you know every battle that you've had to face\n\nIs making you bulletproof?\n\nMe, too\n\nGirl, I believe you",
