  "lyrics": "I donâ€™t know you to wear a hat\r\nBut I came home late, and there it sat\r\nYou rose to show what hats are for\r\nWhen living through a civil war\r\nWhen living through a civil war\n\nChristmas mornings and New Years Days\n\nThey flood with dreams and they drift away\n\nThey cling to logs and cupboard doors\n\nRiding out this civil war\n\nRiding out this civil war\n\n\n\nTwo fighters came and we pitched a tent\n\nAnd everyone around here, we went\n\nThe fix was in, but we bet and we swore\n\nFrom both sides of a civil war\n\n\n\nWe build this up and we knock this down\n\nWe call our little mob a town\n\nWe nail a sign above the door\n\nGod bless our little civil war\n\nGod bless our little civil war\n\n\n\nThree dogs at a party on a boat at night\n\nPlay checkers in a lantern light\n\nThey sing a song out to the shore\n\nOf women, gold, and civil war\n\nEvery truth carries blame\n\n\n\nAnd every light reveals some shame\n\nProgress rides with thieves and whores\n\nThe stowaways of civil war\n\nThe stowaways of civil war",
