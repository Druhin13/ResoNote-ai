  "lyrics": "So long, big city\r\nIt's time to say goodbye\r\nI'm longing for those country roads\r\nI need to see the sky\r\nThink I'll take a swing down south,\r\nVisit Tennessee\n\nSee if that girl Annie\n\nStill remembers me\n\n\n\nGonna take that blue highway\n\nAnd leave this sorry town\n\nStayed too long, but now I'm gone\n\nAnd I know where I'm bound\n\nI don't wanna take the interstate\n\nIt represents all the things I hate\n\nI'm rollin' down that blue highway\n\n\n\nSo long, confusion\n\nIt's time to slow things down\n\nSay goodbye to my old friends\n\nEase on out of town\n\nI made me some money here\n\nBut paid for ev'ry day\n\nAnd ev'ry mile just makes me smile\n\n'Cause I made my getaway\n\n\n\nGonna take that blue highway\n\nAnd leave this sorry town\n\nI've stayed too long\n\nBut now I'm gone\n\nAnd I know where I'm bound\n\nI've had it up to here with worry\n\nFrom now on\n\nI'm in no hurry\n\nRollin' down that blue highway\n\n\n\nI'll be ridin' that blue highway\n\nAnd leave this sorry town\n\nI've stayed too long\n\nBut now I'm gone\n\nAnd I know where I'm bound\n\nI've had it up to here with worry\n\nFrom now on\n\nI'm in no hurry\n\nRollin' down that blue highway\n\nI'll be rollin' down that blue highway\n\nYou can find me on that blue highway",
