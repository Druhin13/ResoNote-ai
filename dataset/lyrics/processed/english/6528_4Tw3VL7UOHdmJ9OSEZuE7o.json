  "lyrics": "Red Cardinals in the white snow\r\nThey got too high to fly home\r\nFor the winter, and I had a roommate once\r\nHe got so high, couldn't go out at night\r\nSo he found love on the internet\r\nAnd it is freezing in Pennsylvania\n\nAnd the rest of the birds are in Turks and Caicos\n\nAnd it reads like a truth commercial\n\nBut we feel bad so we get stoned an do snow angels\n\n\n\nSo we bought a broke down bus and painted it green\n\nAnd we danced in the parking lot under the shadow of '95\n\nAnd all of my favorite people, they don't march to the beat of your drum\n\nThey just keep on keeping on\n\nAnd whatever you're supposed to be\n\nWhatever that's supposed to mean\n\nI just wanted you to know\n\nThat you don't have to come clean to me\n\n\n\nYeah everything's exactly\n\nEverything is exactly where it needs to be\n\nI just wanted you to know\n\nThat you don't have to come clean to me\n\nYeah everything's exactly\n\nYeah everything's exactly\n\nEverything is exactly where it needs to be\n\n\n\nWolves are circling\n\nBlack ties suit them\n\nWolves are circling\n\nBlack ties suit them\n\nSo we light one up 'cause it's in our blood\n\nIt's in our blood\n\nWolves are circling\n\nBlack ties suit them\n\nWolves are circling\n\nBlack ties suit them\n\nWolves are circling\n\nBlack ties suit them\n\nWolves are circling\n\nBlack ties suit them\n\nBut they're not like us",
