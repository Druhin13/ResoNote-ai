  "lyrics": "I could hear it in my head\r\nLike a voice I can't forget\r\nLouder with my every step\r\nIt kept calling me, calling me\r\nI can feel it in the wind\n\nLike a breeze against my skin\n\nTaking me to oceans deep\n\nIt kept pushing me, pushing me\n\n\n\nI didn't recognize it\n\nThere's no way I could fight it\n\nYou opened up my eyes and, oh-ooh\n\nI can see it now\n\n\n\nIt's always been You\n\nIt's always been You\n\nIt's always been You\n\nIt's always been You\n\n\n\nIt was always holding me\n\nEven in my wandering\n\nLike a force of gravity\n\nIt was Your love for me, love for me\n\n\n\nI didn't recognize it\n\nThere's no way I could fight it\n\nYou opened up my eyes and, oh-ooh\n\nI can see it now\n\n\n\nIt's always been You\n\nIt's always been You\n\nIt's always been You\n\nIt's always been You\n\n\n\nIt was always, it was always\n\nIt was always You\n\nIt was always, it was always\n\nIt was always You",
