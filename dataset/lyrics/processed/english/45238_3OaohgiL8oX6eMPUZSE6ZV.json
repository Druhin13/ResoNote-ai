  "lyrics": "My heart's beating so hard\r\nShouldn't be talking so fast\r\nI shouldn't be here at all\r\nComing up as the sun goes down\r\nLights in my eyes, alone in the crowd\r\nI only find myself when I lose control\n\n\n\nI don't know how I got here\n\nAnd my head keeps spinning, spinning\n\nBut this is what I live for, all I live for\n\n\n\nI don't know if I'm flying\n\nDon't know if I'm falling\n\nDon't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nI don't know if I'm flying\n\nDn't know if I'm falling\n\nDon't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nLike Icarus\n\n\n\nI should've been more than this\n\nI was gonna be something big\n\nBut I never did anything at all\n\nComing down as the sun comes up\n\nA new day starts but I just can't stop\n\nNow I know I never really had control\n\n\n\nLying on the pavement\n\nAnd the sky keeps spinning, spinning\n\nBut this is what I live for, all I live for\n\n\n\nI don't know if I'm flying\n\nDon't know if I'm falling\n\nDon't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nI don't know if I'm flying\n\nDn't know if I'm falling\n\nDon't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nLike Icarus\n\n\n\nToo close to the sun\n\nToo messed up to change\n\nBreaking into pieces\n\nGoing down in flames\n\nLost sight of the lies\n\nIf the sky turns black\n\nI'm so scared, so scared\n\nIt's too late to turn back\n\n\n\nI don't know if I'm flying\n\nDon't know if I'm falling\n\nDon't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nI don't know if I'm flying\n\nDn't know if I'm falling\n\nDon't know if I'm burning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nLike Icarus\n\nBurning up, burning up, burning up like Icarus\n\nLike Icarus",
