  "lyrics": "Low-down way you're feeling, \nThe sexy things you do\r\nBaby, baby, baby, \nLet me talk to you\r\nI just love to whisper \nIn your sexy ear\n\nTell you that I love you, \n\nTake away your fear\n\nDestroy your inhibitions, \n\nRidin' back the day\n\nLow-down, slow down, \n\nKeeping low down \n\nIn that funky way\n\n\n\nHigher, higher, higher, \n\nHow high can you go\n\nRide me high this morning, \n\nRide me high some more\n\n\n\nThe way you move your body, \n\nIt is a crying shame\n\nI won't tell nobody \n\nIf you will do the same\n\nIf you leave tomorrow, \n\nOne thing that's for sure\n\nThe more you get, \n\nThe more you've got, \n\nThe more you want some more\n\n\n\nHigher, higher, higher, \n\nHow high can you go\n\nRide me high this morning, \n\nRide me high some more\n\nHigher, higher, higher, \n\nHow high can you go\n\nRide me high this morning, \n\nRide me high some more",
