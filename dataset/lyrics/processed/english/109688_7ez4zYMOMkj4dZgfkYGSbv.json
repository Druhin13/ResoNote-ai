  "lyrics": "You sold you records by the pile\r\nFor they were only yours for a while\r\nYou placed your furniture in the yard\r\nAnd it was gone within the hour\r\nWhen you moved away\n\nAll your friends came over and you told them what to take\n\nWhen you moved away\n\nEveryone thought it was a mistake\n\n\n\nYou mopped floors and filled the cracks\n\nTo get your security deposit back\n\nYou closed your account at the bank\n\nYou checked your tires and filled the tank\n\n\n\nWhen you moved away\n\nAll of your friends got drunk and one by one begged you to stay\n\nWhen you moved away\n\nThey all felt irrationally betrayed\n\n\n\nSince you moved away\n\nI walk past your vacant apartment almost every day\n\nWhen you moved away\n\nYou left this town with such an empty space",
