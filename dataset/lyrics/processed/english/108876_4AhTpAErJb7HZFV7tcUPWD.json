  "lyrics": "Never wanted to let you down\r\nNever wanted us to fight\r\nOh, sweet love o' mine\r\nI guess this goodbye to you and I\r\nTime is a stubborn affair\r\nThe distance was too much to bear\n\nOh, with a heavy heart\n\nI must leave the one I love\n\n\n\nWe could've tried a bit harder, mm\n\nI could've practiced more patience, mm\n\nLook at this good love we've wasted\n\nAnother good thing gone\n\n\n\nNeither one of us is wrong\n\nNeither one of us is right\n\nI never fully have faith, you see\n\n'Cause I always knew you'd fall out of love with me\n\n\n\nWe could've tried a bit harder, mm\n\nI could've practiced more patience, mm\n\nLook at this good love we've wasted\n\nAnother good thing gone\n\n\n\nSo why should I change?\n\nIf love always ends this way\n\n\n\nYou couldn't put down that ashtray\n\nI couldn't get that shit passed me\n\nWe could've tried a bit harder, mm\n\nBut I just ain't got that much patience, mm\n\nLook at this good love we've wasted\n\nAnother good thing gone",
