  "lyrics": "Yeah, the universe let the planets align\r\nSpent 10k in the card, didn't decline\r\nBartender, one Casamigos and lime\r\nI'm celebrating gracefully, getting better with time\r\nI ain't even halfway through this incredible ride\r\nBut like, I'm kind of doing an incredible job\n\nWhen I was eighteen living beyond my means\n\nI was afraid of my dreams, looking at the finer things\n\nWishing I could l flip to a microchip from a paper clip\n\nUpgrade to a spaceship from a basic whip\n\nCash rules everything, I just wanted a taste of it\n\nFast food hurrying, saving time, not wasting it\n\nSelf-saboteur, speaking it to my paramour\n\nTorch rappers like I'm igniting the aerosol\n\nMaintaining the wherewithal that'll embarrass y'all\n\nGame-changer, the way I shredded your cabbage off\n\nExplaining this change in apples to applesauce\n\nWhen we were young, innocence was ours, but that was lost\n\nWhere I reside is the dark side of the glory\n\nThe fury I manipulate is the arc of the story\n\nWritten without a ghostwriter to author it for me\n\nThis is crime and the punishment, I'm the judge and the jury\n\nListen, Dostoyevsky\n\n\n\nI swam with crocs, fished with sharks\n\nI never popped charts, but I know I'm popular\n\nI was built to run the game, I came up playing guard\n\nWith young niggas between 5'5\" and 6 foot 4\n\nI banged over both, tryna bank over some more\n\nAnd ball out in something gorgeous that'll keep me in court\n\nWhere they'll judge like y'all does, y'all don't know me enough\n\nY'all still owe us for what all y'all did to the Cold Crush\n\nTo my donuts, I'm shooting J. Dillas and what\n\nI wanna cop when I get loot and recoup\n\nI had to go through hella doors so in short that's why I only won two\n\nBut I ain't got Jay number, I CC 'em the proof\n\n'Cause everything I pictured in my head is always coming true\n\nThey say you need vision to see eye to eye with the Jews\n\nSpent 25 hundred on sheep skin, let it seep in\n\nI ain't turn starboy in a weekend\n\nIt took more like 7 years, make a sane man drink Everclear\n\nIt ain't ever clear, yeah, we ain't ever guaranteed the year\n\nFruits of your labor, huh, you work hard to get it\n\nJamla stitched on the motherfucking ROC fitted\n\nBefore the big life I had to start with the scrimmage\n\nKnow that it'd come sooner or later, I'm Trae Young, nigga\n\nHuh, I'm Trae Young, nigga\n\n\n\nUh, I said Dostoyevsky meets Joe Pesci\n\nTired of staring at a glass half empty\n\nTurning me from Dr. Sebi to cocking semi\n\nIt got me clutching my machete from the Serengeti already\n\nWild Style and Fab Five Freddy\n\nI'm a stranger in Moscow, don't ask how deadly is the ummah\n\nPatrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah\n\nTo the Tripoli shores from the halls of Montezuma\n\nStop intruder, I'm built on facts, I'm not your rumor\n\nA malignant tumor, slid through in a suede Puma\n\nThe steady heavy legendary, all praise is overdue\n\nSame cloth as the chosen few, rap Noble Drew\n\nI guarantee you know more music by the suckers\n\nIt's not a victimless crime if anybody suffers\n\nIn a system that was designed for them to try to cuff us\n\nWell, what's the use for them trying when can't nobody touch us?\n\nUnless it's fabricated, probably drug related\n\nBut love or hate it, I will not be subjugated\n\nWhen they scream at you the greatest that did it, was underrated\n\nAs if every other player who spit it was unrelated\n\nIf every man's a temple, the circumstance is simple\n\nSo to be transcendental, I do enhance the mental\n\nThis is elder statesmen conversation\n\nTake a look into them books from down in the basement, yeah",
