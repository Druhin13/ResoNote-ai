I swear to God you were my all\n\nMy greatest fall\n\n\n\nI tried to be all that you need\n\nI guess to you, I guess to me\n\nWe're done for good, we're history\n\nI close my eyes picture your face\n\nBut to you I'm history\n\n\n\nSo what am I, what am I supposed to do\n\nJust forget about you\n\nFeel 16, feeling our break all over\n\nFor the very first time\n\nHow do you want me to, fake a smile when I see you\n\nLike I'm happy for you\n\n\n\nOh I swear, I swear to God you were my all\n\nMy hardest fall\n\n\n\nI tried to be all that you need\n\nI guess to you, I guess to me\n\nWe're done for good, we're history\n\nI close my eyes, picture your face\n\nStill see you laying next to me\n\nI lost the biggest part of me\n\n\n\nNow I just can't seem to let it go\n\nAnd I know that you moved on\n\nI won't give up hope\n\nBut I suppose\n\n\n\nI guess to you, I guess to me\n\nWe're done for good\n\nWe're history\n\n\n\nYou used to mean\n\nThe world to me\n\nDon't tell me you forgot\n\nJust keep me in your memory\n\n\n\nI tried to be all that you need\n\nI guess to you, I guess to me\n\nWe're done for good, we're history\n\nI close my eyes, picture your face\n\nStill see you laying next to me\n\nI lost the biggest part of me\n\n\n\nNow I just can't seem to let it go\n\nAnd I know that you moved on\n\nI won't give up hope\n\nBut I suppose\n\n\n\nI guess to you, I guess to me\n\nWe're done for good, we're history\n\n\n\nOhhhh ohhh ohhh",
