  "lyrics": "It's easy to have faith everything is going to work out, when everything is working out\r\nYou see, it's much harder to have faith, when you are facing challenges in your life\r\nBut that is exactly when you need to apply your faith\r\nBecause faith is believing in the unseen\r\nFaith is taking the first step\r\nFaith is jumping in the deep end and knowing everything will be okay\r\nIt's easy to be positive when everything is working out\r\nBut it's much harder, much much harder when nothing is working out\r\nBut that's when we need it the most\r\nEverything worth the prize is worth the fight!\r\nEverything worth the prize will require a real fight to achieve that prize\r\nIf you want the prize, you can't quit at half time\r\nYou can't quit mid season\r\nYou must play the whole game\r\nPre season, through the cold, through darkness, through the through the challenges and the opponents\r\nYou will be knocked down of course, but you must get up\r\nKeep fighting!\r\nDig deep!\r\nAnd discover your true strength!\r\nThen you will win the real prize\r\nCharacter, expansion, you rising to the next level\r\nIf I survive the storm, I can outdo the norm\r\nTo breakthrough the norm, I must first surive the storms\r\nTo have more than most, I must do more than most\r\nBelieve more than most\r\nLearn more than most\r\nSacrifice more than most\r\nBelieve more than most\r\nNow, say to yourself:\r\nLong term - I know what I need will come my way\r\nLong term - I know if I keep at it I will be rewarded\r\nLong term - I know consistency pays off\r\nLong term - I know all my actions, all my discipline, all my integrity will pay off in a big way\r\nI have faith everything will work out\r\nIn the end, all will be fine\r\nIf I keep working\r\nIf I keep learing\r\nIf I continue to evolve\r\nIf I continue to adapt\r\nIf I learn new ways\r\nSet backs aren't always negative\r\nSometimes they sent to guide us in a much bigger and better direction\r\nBut you can only see that if you show character in those hard times\r\nIf you remain open minded in the hard times\r\nIf you show strength through your struggles\r\nDon't say: \"why me\"\r\nAsk: \"How can I come out of this stronger?\", \"What can I learn?\"\r\nIn the hard times, we see who really has the character\r\nIn the hard times, we see what people are really made of\r\nWhat are you made of? Tell me, what are you made of?\r\nCharacter, expansion, growth and pride!\r\nCharacter, expansion, growth and pride!\r\nDig deep!\r\nFind that strength, that lives inside you\r\nTrust, that if you keep doing your thing, you will be rewarded\r\nIt might not happen right away it rarely does, but it will happen if you keep going\r\nDon't allow regret to enter your life\r\nDon't you dare look back on your life in 5 years and think: \"I could have done more\", \"If only I stuck it out, I could have been in a much better position\"\r\nNo, look back with pride\r\nLook back and be able to say to yourself: \"It wasn't easy, but I am so proud I stuck it out, because I got my rewards\"\r\nMake sure your story is one of strength\r\nMake sure your story is one of someone who refused to give up\r\nSomeone who refused to settle\r\nSomeone who refused to be normal\r\nKeep going\r\nYour future self is begging you",
