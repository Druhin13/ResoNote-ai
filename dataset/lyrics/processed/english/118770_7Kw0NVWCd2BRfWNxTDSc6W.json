  "lyrics": "I feel up, but I feel grounded at the same time\r\nHey, free them guys though\r\nHey\r\nI take a sip from my oil, yellow ('Tussin)\r\nIt pulled me down to a lower level (Sunken)\n\nI got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)\n\nStuck in the system, Lord help 'em (Damn)\n\nThe next time we talk man, I'm gon' tell em (What?)\n\nI wanna see you do more better\n\nRemember we slept on the floor together (Where?)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)\n\nI-I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)\n\nStuck in the system, Lord help 'em\n\n(I don't know how long you got\n\nI don't know what the lawyer doin' with that bullshit)\n\nRemember we slept on the floor together (Word)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)\n\n(Makin' pallets and shit, eatin' Cup Noodles)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom (Lower level)\n\n\n\nThey money never changed me (Nope)\n\nIt changed my situation (I just changed for the better)\n\nGot niggas in the hood, can't leave the state of Tennessee (Why?)\n\nThey on probation (Papers)\n\nWord of mouth got you picked up\n\nNo evidence in that room (What?)\n\nThey gon' try to break you (Shh)\n\nStay silent, don't fold\n\nThey can't do shit but hold you (Under)\n\n72 hour investigation (That's it)\n\n'Member all the times I was robbin' just to come up (Come up)\n\nLookin' for a lick late night 'til the sun up (Remember)\n\nSippin' 'Tuss straight out the bottle, put the cup up (Yellow)\n\nThinkin' 'bout your fuck-ups while you light the blunt up\n\nShe barely wanted you back when you had payments\n\nPink slip now, but your cars was rented\n\nGot booked with a record, I ain't talkin' 'bout Guinness\n\nShe gon' fuck the next nigga when you get sentenced (Damn)\n\nI can't forget where I came from (Came from)\n\nIt's to the point where the pain numb (Can't feel)\n\nLost his dog while incarcerated\n\nGot to hear 'bout the funeral, can't come (What it do?)\n\nThey broke him down to the lowest level (Lowest level)\n\nHe gotta live with it forever (Forever)\n\nClosin' your eyes, it ain't no better (Why?)\n\nVisualizin' all the time together (Damn)\n\n\n\nI take a sip from my oil, yellow ('Tussin)\n\nIt pulled me down to a lower level (Sunken)\n\nI got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)\n\nStuck in the system, Lord help 'em (Damn)\n\nThe next time we talk man, I'm gon' tell em (What?)\n\nI wanna see you do more better\n\nRemember we slept on the floor together (Where?)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom, lower level\n\nI-I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)\n\nStuck in the system, Lord help 'em\n\n(I don't know how long you got\n\nI don't know what the lawyer doin' with that bullshit)\n\nRemember we slept on the floor together (Where?)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)\n\n(Makin' pallets and shit, eatin' Cup Noodles)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom (The gutter, the bottom)\n\n\n\nAll gas nigga, all powder\n\nSippin' lean, I'm on a new level\n\nPoppin' beans, I'm tryna do better\n\nFuckin' bitches like I'm Hugh Hefner\n\nPlatinum teeth 'cause I'm a Platinum artist\n\nI can't be humble, I'm hungry\n\nI can't be fuckin' with homie\n\nI can't keep clutchin' this .40\n\nI used to run in them stores, go ask the people, they know it\n\nI used to kick in them doors, nigga better give me my glory\n\nWe used to sleep on the floor, now you don't love me no more\n\nI done been broke before, I done been in the rain\n\nRidin' 'round spendin' and things, now I'm in Fendi and things\n\nGot me on Xannies and things, all I be feelin' is pain\n\nIt make me go to a place, it make me go to a spot\n\nThat I ain't never forgot\n\nI was piped down in the box, you already know what I'm about\n\n\n\n(Hey)\n\nBeat the odds, they was all against me\n\nHard to separate fake when they all friendly\n\nI'm in tune with reality (Yeah)\n\nSo I never let myself get caught up in it (Nope)\n\nPerceivin' new haters knowin' that's comin' with it\n\nBe your own charge partner, nigga fuck a codefendant\n\nSeem like it come and find you when you tryin' to prevent it\n\nSame dude body dropped, prayed 'bout it, I'll repent it\n\nIt 'posed to be us back to back in them Bentleys\n\nInstead, I'm in court seein' you behind the benches\n\n(One thing for sure)\n\nYour kids and them good, Mama out the hood\n\nYou all that's missin' (Free you)\n\nYou bein' in the can wasn't in the plan\n\nFrom them talks in the kitcken (Old talks)\n\nI wish I could buy the jail, set 'em all free\n\nFuck it, tear down the fences (Free my niggas)\n\n\n\nI take a sip from my oil, yellow ('Tussin)\n\nIt pulled me down to a lower level (Sunken)\n\nI got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)\n\nStuck in the system, Lord help 'em (Damn)\n\nThe next time we talk man, I'm gon' tell em (What?)\n\nI wanna see you do more better\n\nRemember we slept on the floor together (Where?)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom, lower level\n\nI-I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)\n\nStuck in the system, Lord help 'em\n\n(I don't know how long you got\n\nI don't know what the lawyer doin' with that bullshit)\n\nRemember we slept on the floor together (Where?)\n\nThe gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)\n\n(Makin' pallets and shit, eatin' Cup Noodles)\n\nThe gutter the bottom (Lower level)",
