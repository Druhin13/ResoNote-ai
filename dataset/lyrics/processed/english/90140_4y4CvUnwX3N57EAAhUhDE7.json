  "lyrics": "I drink my coffee in the morning\r\nI brush my teeth before bed\r\nI fake a smile to keep the sad thought\r\nOut of my head\r\nI sit outside and watch the world spin\r\nI bet you probably moved on\n\nBut I still can't seem to sing\n\nHmm, anything but this song\n\n\n\nI've asked my therapist, my mom and dad the same\n\nI've asked my friends and fam, they all say I'm to blame\n\nI've spent all this time pretending I'm okay\n\nWell, I'm not okay\n\n\n\nToday might be the day I go insane\n\nThe day I go insane\n\nThe day I go insane\n\nThat'll be the day, today might be the day\n\nThe day I go insane\n\n\n\nIt'll probably be the best day in my life\n\nI'll be rid of all my problems, I'll be rid of my strife\n\nAnd I can't even fix an issue 'bout you sayin' good night\n\nAnd I don't even got to worry if I'm wrong or I'm right\n\nAnd when I argue with my darkest side, it's comin' to light\n\nI'd rather have 'em call me crazy, than have another fight with you\n\nThis mind of mine is mine to lose, it's true\n\n\n\nI've asked my therapist, my mom and dad the same\n\nI've asked my friends and fam, they all say I'm to blame\n\nI've spent all this time pretending I'm okay\n\nWell, I'm not okay\n\n\n\nToday might be the day I go insane\n\nThe day I go insane\n\nThe day I go insane\n\nThat'll be the day, today might be the day\n\n\n\nIf today's the day I go insane\n\nPlease tell my mom and dad I'm not in pain\n\nAnd tell my sister not to do the same\n\nIt's just, these lonely days get lonelier with rain\n\nAnd then the feelings come and go and pass in waves (Pass in waves)\n\nAnd I can feel myself start to get swept away (Swept away)\n\nI guess if your heart can break, then your head can do the same (Do the same)\n\nIt's hard to explain\n\n\n\nToday might be the day I go insane\n\nThe day I go insane\n\nThe day I go insane\n\nThat'll be the day, today might be the day\n\n\n\nThe day I go insane (Hey, I'm not okay)\n\nThe day I go insane (Today, I'll go insane)\n\nThe day I go insane (Hey, I'm not okay)\n\nThat'll be the day, today might be the day (Today, I'll go insane)\n\nThe day I go insane\n\n\n\nYeah, it hurts, but it's true, I shouldn't care, but I do\n\nI hide who I'm inside, like I've got something to prove\n\nBut what I've learned is that pretending ends up bad for my health\n\nWhat's the point of being if I'm not being myself?",
