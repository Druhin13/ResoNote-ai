(Ahh)\n\nAnd when you touch me, I'm a fool\n\nThis game I know I'm gonna lose\n\nMakes me want you more\n\n\n\nEven if it means that I'll never put myself back together\n\nGonna give you my heart to break\n\nEven if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter\n\nGonna give you my heart to break\n\nI tried to fight, but I can't help it\n\nDon't care if this is my worst mistake (No)\n\n'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better, that's why I)\n\nThat's why I give you my heart to break\n\n\n\nEvery time\n\nHeart to break\n\nWoo-ah!\n\nEvery time\n\nHeart to break\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nOne look at you, I'm powerless\n\nI feel my body saying yes\n\nWhere's my self control? Ahh\n\nAnd when you touch me, I'm a fool\n\nThis game I know I'm gonna lose\n\nMakes me want you more (more, more)\n\n\n\nEven if it means that I'll never put myself back together\n\nGonna give you my heart to break\n\nEven if I'll end up in shatters, baby it doesn't matter\n\nGonna give you my heart to break\n\nI tried to fight, but I can't help it (I tried to fight, help it)\n\nDon't care if this is my worst mistake\n\n'Cause no one else could do it better (No one else, better)\n\nThat's why I give you my heart to break",
