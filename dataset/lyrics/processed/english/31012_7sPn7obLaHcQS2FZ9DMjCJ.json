  "lyrics": "She lamented far from home\r\nYou flew straight to Mexico\r\nOver the bridge and across the wall\r\nBuilt around white cracker drool\r\nGrab your gun and turn his hand\n\nWalkin' across the promised land\n\nSettle down and drink your joe\n\nEnjoy the scene before it implodes\n\n\n\n\n\nShe went into the road\n\nFelt the dust beneath her toes\n\n[?] look far from [?]\n\nFelt for the fleeting homes\n\n\n\nGrab your gun and turn his hand\n\nWalkin' across the promised land\n\nSettle down and drink your joe\n\nEnjoy the scene before it implodes\n\n\n\n\n\nWords spoken in the dark\n\nAlienation, biting hearts\n\nWant nothing, want no bar\n\nHeld hostage from the start\n\n\n\nGrab your gun and turn his hand\n\nWalkin' across the promised land\n\nSettle down and drink your joe\n\nEnjoy the scene before it implodes\n\nImplodes\n\nImplodes\n\nImplodes",
