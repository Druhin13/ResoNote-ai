  "lyrics": "Sometimes I think this world's too much\r\nAll the hurt, all the hurt, all it takes is a human touch\r\nIt's so easy to get lost in the light\r\nMake a change, make a choice, all the noise, we can drown it out\r\nMeet me out where the stars turn blue\n\nCome on, touch the sky and enjoy the view\n\nSome come here, make it all disappear like lovers do\n\nI wish that I could build a world for two\n\nI wish that I could build a world for two\n\n\n\nKiss me like there's no one else for miles\n\nTake it fast, take it slow, letting go for a little while\n\nHeaven's so close to the both of us\n\nFor the rest of the night we can fly, we can rise above\n\n\n\nMeet me out where the stars turn blue\n\nCome on, touch the sky and enjoy the view\n\nSome come here, make it all disappear like lovers do\n\nGirl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two\n\nGirl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two\n\n\n\nGirl for you, I'd build a world\n\nFor two, I'd build a world\n\nGirl for you, I'd build a world\n\nFor two, yeah\n\n\n\nMeet me out where the stars turn blue\n\nCome on, touch the sky and enjoy the view\n\nSome come here, make it all disappear like lovers do\n\nGirl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two\n\nGirl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two\n\n\n\nMeet me out where the stars turn blue\n\nCome on, touch the sky and enjoy the view\n\nSome come here, make it all disappear like lovers do\n\nGirl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two\n\nGirl, for you, I wish that I could build a world for two",
