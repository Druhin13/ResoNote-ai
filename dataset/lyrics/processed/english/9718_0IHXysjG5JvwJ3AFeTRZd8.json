  "lyrics": "The angel Moroni asleep in the carport\r\nWith the newspaper under his arm\r\nIt seems I was late to deliver his car keys\r\nSo it looks like we are staying behind\r\nWas Lucifer bashful\n\nIn hiding his face from the Lord\n\nDear Jesus, forgive me\n\nI'm only doing as I was told\n\n\n\nFor as it is written\n\nI will soon one day face my own fire\n\nThis world will go with me\n\nIf I can just get them all on my side\n\n\n\nCarry me over rainbows and Rainier\n\nCarry me over rainbows and Rainier\n\n\n\nI was late to the parlor\n\nWhen the wind it blew forward\n\nAnd demanded we get out of town\n\nSo me and Moroni\n\nTook the keys to the steeple\n\nAnd awaited Armageddon to go down\n\n\n\nPlace your queens on the table\n\nWho are weeping for your daughters\n\nWho are waiting for their Sunday to return\n\nEvery heart will be broken\n\nProphetic poems spoken\n\nFrom the mouths of every baby to be born\n\n\n\nCarry me over rainbows and Rainier\n\nCarry me over rainbows and Rainier\n\n\n\nLet your cries be enjoyed\n\nLet it always and forever fill the void\n\nAllow my heart some room\n\nMay it be so that you'll one day need me soon\n\n\n\nMy wheels that are turning\n\nAnd my back to the window\n\nI collected every wave from the shore\n\nI forgot I was human...\n\nAnd I laid up my emotions\n\nAnd I knocked them like dishes to the floor\n\n\n\nCarry me over rainbows and Rainier\n\nCarry me over rainbows and Rainier",
