  "lyrics": "Don’t really know if anybody got the message\r\nProduct of disaster and you’re looking at the wreckage\r\nFrom a different spot but don’t focus on my percentage\r\nCause I’m up and in the game watch me get out of the carriage ah\r\nOh no, I’m off at it\r\nThey listenin but I’m not tatted\n\nHit a home run but I been batted\n\nThat’s TSA and I been patted like whoa\n\n100 off and I’m still chattin'\n\nSweatshirt and that’s not satin\n\nPeople hit me like what’s happenin'\n\nBut they never know what’s happenin'\n\n\n\nPlotting on the low, they see me scheming on the side\n\nThey think I do not have the answers, I’m just tryna learn to ride\n\nEverything that they been saying, I just try to take in stride\n\nJust a stud that’s in the game, and you know it’s bonafide\n\nYeah, know it’s bonafide, like I’m Enzo Amore\n\nNext year I’ll go top forty, if you see me don’t ignore me\n\nY’all just run on treadmills (yeah), you can’t get ahead still (yeah)\n\nSee you sleeping on the side (woo!), tell me how the bench feel\n\nTell me what’s the plan then?\n\nI got a team of the steves (steves)\n\nIf you’re not with me then leave\n\nI only give not receive\n\nShout out my boys at TAMID\n\nThey see me running it’s fast\n\nYeah I might roll up my sleeves\n\nI’m writing the album in class\n\nI just wanna clarify you know I’m not a know it all\n\nSomeday I’ll meet Sway and on the mic you know I’m going off\n\nI call your bluff and then you know I'm gon' be showing off\n\nI am not a faker homie word to Rachel Dolezal\n\nYou don’t get that I found the niche\n\nDon’t get that I couldn’t talk about stuff that is not believable\n\nInconceivable how I walked up never been careless\n\nPeople listening even all the parents\n\nGot on the charts up in Canada and that’s one spot right above Calvin Harris that’s no lie\n\nReally know that that’s no lie (no lie)\n\nI am not like the old guys (old guys)\n\nI am not wearing Old Spice (Old Spice)\n\nBut we popping you know why (know why)\n\nI don’t pretend to be someone I’m not\n\nI don’t pretend to be someone that’s fake\n\nI don’t pretend to be getting a lot\n\nBut I’m on the come up you know\n\n\n\nDon’t really know if anybody got the message\n\nProduct of disaster and you’re looking at the wreckage\n\nFrom a different spot but don’t focus on my percentage\n\nCause I’m up and in the game watch me get out of the carriage ah\n\nOh no, I’m off at it\n\nThey listenin but I’m not tatted\n\nHit a home run but I been batted\n\nThat’s TSA and I been patted like whoa\n\n100 off and I’m still chattin'\n\nSweatshirt and that’s not satin\n\nPeople hit me like what’s happenin'\n\nBut they never know what’s happenin'\n\n\n\nI just wanna say, everything I need to say\n\nFeel like everything’s in place, can I see another day?\n\nGot my boys in 101 (brrp), competition think we done\n\nI just think we're on a run, I’m just doing this for fun\n\nI think that I need it they know when I’m rapping it’s so therapeutic\n\nI think that I finally figured out how to convey with the music\n\nI think that I know what I’m doing they think that I’m not on a roll\n\nI think that you misunderstand what I see as the ultimate goal\n\nOh no that’s reps up with my seat back\n\nStage now I got feedback\n\nSugared up like a sweet pack\n\nBut I take L’s like a D-Back\n\nGluten-free on the meat rack\n\nPush me and I leap back\n\nMy hair never greased back\n\nBut I’m on the left no CPAC\n\nNow I’m dealing with these wacks\n\nSee people lying\n\nThey just talk bout the chains now, while millions of people dying\n\nYou been in your basement, but you talking like you’re flying\n\nMy song just put me on the map, and I wasn’t even trying\n\nYeah, wasn’t even trying\n\nSo I swear I want it all (yeah)\n\nHomie that’s Spring to the Fall\n\nIf you ain’t with it don’t call\n\nPick up the phone and I’m doing midterms with an album on the way\n\nAlready told ‘em the way that I do it is so exclusive for the Bay\n\nI’m on a wave, nothing to save, in the Presidio writing songs\n\nBut they could see me though all along\n\nYeah they could see me though on the track\n\nI might reverse it and bring it back\n\nWith a kick then a snare\n\nOh I wouldn’t care cause I’m really out here\n\nAnd they follow but to where\n\nNext up with a leg up if you thinking that you the competition\n\nFlexed up with the stress up if you wanna listen I won’t tell you different\n\nOh yeah that’s all rap no singing now they gon' say I’m switching\n\nYour song it pops up well that’s something I am definitely skipping (brrp)\n\n\n\nDon’t really know if anybody got the message\n\nProduct of disaster and you’re looking at the wreckage\n\nFrom a different spot but don’t focus on my percentage\n\nCause I’m up and in the game watch me get out of the carriage ah\n\nOh no, I’m off at it\n\nThey listenin but I’m not tatted\n\nHit a home run but I been batted\n\nThat’s TSA and I been patted like whoa\n\n100 off and I’m still chattin'\n\nSweatshirt and that’s not satin\n\nPeople hit me like what’s happenin'\n\nBut they never know what’s happenin'",
