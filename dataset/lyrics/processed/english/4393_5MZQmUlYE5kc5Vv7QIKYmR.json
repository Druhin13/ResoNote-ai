  "lyrics": "You are your own disco ball\r\nHovering above you like a comforting reminder\r\nThat not even you belong to you\r\nSo you put your jazz hands in the air\r\nAnd they get tangled in your hair\r\nBut you'll always stand the victors\n\nExercising everything by tapping into nothing\n\n\n\nThere's another field\n\nYour distances are vast\n\nHey, you, I know who you are\n\nOpen up to me so I can pull the night\n\n\n\nYou will not be awake for long\n\nYou won't have to wait for long\n\nYou will not be awake for long\n\nWe'll meet in the smallest great unknown\n\nWe will not be awake for long\n\nWe will not be awake for long\n\nWe'll meet in the smallest great unknown\n\n\n\nYou, I know that feeling, I'm waiting for you (Baby, baby)\n\nAnd the silences between hurts\n\nAnd I say, \"Hey, Jasmine, dancing is futile\n\nIt can not hold you like I can.\"\n\nI wanna hold you, wanna hold you\n\n\n\nYou will not be awake for long\n\nYou won't have to wait for long\n\nYou will not be awake for long\n\nWe'll, we'll meet, we'll meet in the smallest great unknown\n\nWait for me, wait for me\n\nWe will not be awake for long\n\nYou won't be awake\n\nWe will not be awake for long\n\nWe'll meet in the smallest great unknown\n\n\n\nYou are lost in the [?]\n\nYou are lost, exercising everything by tapping into nothing",
