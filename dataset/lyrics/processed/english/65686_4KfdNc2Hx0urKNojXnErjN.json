  "lyrics": "At the end of it all\r\nWe stand transparent\r\nDestroying the burden\r\nTo sustain\r\nLeaving no piece\r\nTo remain\n\n\n\nThe dead never leave\n\nThey live on in what they conceive\n\nWhat was born in our time\n\nWill not be mourned or unwind\n\n\n\nUnfit we are\n\nYou've shared your worth\n\nSo we could receive\n\nWhat we did not deserve\n\n\n\nA debt you will bear\n\nA cost to be shared\n\nAs a living sacrifice\n\nSpliced from our lives\n\n\n\nEndowed to those who shared their worth\n\nSo we could partake in what we did not deserve",
