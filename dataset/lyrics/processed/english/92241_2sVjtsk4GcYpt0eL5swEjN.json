  "lyrics": "On a golden autumn day returning\r\nWhere each moment never is the same\r\nSometimes pure joy it comes with patience\r\nWhen I'm waiting on, waiting game\r\nWhen I'm waiting on, waiting game\n\nThere must be reason for all this inaction\n\nDoes it mean that everything must change\n\nSometimes I'm looking for perfection\n\nWhen I'm waiting on, waiting game\n\nWhen I'm waiting on, waiting game\n\n\n\nI am the observer who is observing\n\nI am the brother of this snake\n\nI am the serpent filled with venom\n\nA god of love and a god of hate\n\n\n\nThere is a presence deep within you\n\nSometimes they call it higher flame\n\nAnd the leaves come tumbling down, remember\n\nI'll be waiting on, waiting game\n\nI'll be waiting on, waiting game\n\n\n\nI am the observer who is observing\n\nI am the brother of this snake\n\nI am the serpent filled with venom\n\nA god of love and a god of hate\n\n\n\nThere is a presence deep within you\n\nSome people call it higher power in flame\n\nWhen the leaves come tumbling down, remember\n\nI'll be waiting on, waiting game\n\nI'll be waiting on, waiting game.....",
