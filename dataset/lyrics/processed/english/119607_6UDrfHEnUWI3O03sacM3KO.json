  "lyrics": "I don't really wanna try and change your mind\r\nIf you can't find a way to love me, it's alright\r\nBut you don't wanna wake up alone\r\nYou want someone to keep you warm\r\nAnd if you're cold inside I'll start a fire\n\nBut you just let it die\n\nAnd if you're lost inside I'll be your guide\n\nThe moonlight in your sky\n\n\n\nBut you know, I can't stop you from leaving\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving\n\nEverybody needs the space for breathin', yeah\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving\n\n\n\nEvery time you feel low, mm\n\nI can always be your hero\n\nOoh, but you only think for yourself\n\nAnd you look out for somebody else\n\n\n\nAnd if you're cold inside I'll start a fire\n\nBut you just let it die\n\nAnd if you're lost inside I'll be your guide\n\nThe moonlight in your sky\n\n\n\nBut you know, I can't stop you from leaving\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving\n\nEverybody needs the space for breathin', yeah\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving\n\n\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving\n\nEverybody needs the space for breathin', yeah\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving\n\n\n\nEverybody needs the space for breathin', yeah\n\nYou know I can't stop you from leaving",
