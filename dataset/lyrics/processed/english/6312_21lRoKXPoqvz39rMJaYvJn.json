  "lyrics": "Keep my head down and in my hands\r\nMy eyes move slowly side to side\r\nI'm fading in and out of consciousness\r\nI never learned to pull myself\r\nOut of my own damn head\r\nShoulders caved in to protect\n\nAll of my insides from falling out\n\nOf the hole above my neck\n\nI'm feeling light in my head\n\nSomebody come close\n\nI just wanna be alone\n\n\n\nThis feels like a hot summer night\n\nIn a turtle neck\n\nI think I wanna die\n\nBut I guess I know I'm fine\n\nOh God, tell me is it over yet?\n\n\n\nMy words disappear on a dry tongue\n\nAnd I am trying to let you know it\n\nBut I am drowning by the moment\n\nI guess I've been having trouble sleeping\n\nBut now I'm having trouble breathing\n\nAnd I hate that I can be seen like this\n\n\n\nThis feels like a hot summer night\n\nIn a turtle neck\n\nI think I wanna die\n\nBut I guess I know I'm fine\n\nOh God, tell me is it over yet?\n\nOver yet?\n\n\n\nThink slowly, try to remember I'm alive\n\nMy body is here and I am inside\n\nThink slowly, try to remember I'm alive\n\nMy body is here and I am inside\n\nThink slowly, try to remember I'm alive\n\nMy body is here and I am inside\n\nThink slowly, try to remember I'm alive\n\nMy body is here and I am inside\n\nThink slowly, try to remember I'm alive\n\nMy body is here and I am inside\n\nThink slowly, try to remember I'm alive\n\nMy body is here and I am inside",
