  "lyrics": "Even when I'm used for a long time\r\nYou get me through every dark night\r\nI'm always gone, out on the go\r\nI'm on the run and you're home alone\r\nI'm too consumed with my own life\n\nAre we too young for this?\n\nFeels like I can't move\n\n\n\nSharing my heart\n\nIt's tearing me apart\n\nBut I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now\n\nDoing what I can, tryna be a man\n\nAnd every time I kiss you, baby\n\nI can hear the sound of breaking down\n\n\n\nI've been confused as of late (yeah)\n\nWatching my youth slip away (yeah)\n\nYou're like the sun, you make me young\n\nBut you drain me out if I get too much\n\nI might need you on my break\n\n\n\nAre we too young for this?\n\nFeels like I can't move\n\n\n\nSharing my heart\n\nIt's tearing me apart\n\nBut I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now\n\nDoing what I can, tryna be a man\n\nAnd every time I kiss you, baby\n\nI can hear the sound of breaking down\n\n\n\nI don't want to play this part\n\nBut I do, I feel young\n\nI don't want to make this hard\n\nBut now I will 'cause I'm still\n\n\n\nSharing my heart\n\nIt's tearing me apart\n\nBut I know I'd miss you, baby, if I left right now\n\nDoing what I can, tryna be a man (be your man)\n\nAnd every time I kiss you, baby\n\nI can hear the sound of breaking down\n\n\n\nSharing my head, mhm\n\nSharing my head, yeah\n\nSharing my head\n\nSharing my head\n\n(Breaking down)\n\nSharing my heart\n\nIt's tearing me and suddenly I'm\n\n(Breaking down)\n\nIt's tearing my mind\n\nIt's tearing my life",
