  "lyrics": "Lost in time and space\r\nAimless drifting to a far off place\r\nHurtling through the vast unknown\r\nStaring straight into the pure, black void\r\nDrowning in the sea of stars\r\nLost in a galaxy of cocktail bars\n\nBlinded by the neon lights\n\nI lie awake and say your name into the night\n\n\n\nI guess she’s gone for good\n\nShe don’t call me like I thought she would\n\nShe went west to chase her dreams\n\nShe took my money, but she didn’t take me\n\nWhy go wander unknown worlds?\n\nStay right here and let the cosmos twirl\n\nBlind without her source of light\n\nI light a flame and say her name into the night\n\n\n\nI don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am\n\n\n\nLost in time and space\n\nAimless searching for a long, lost face\n\nHaven’t got a thing to lose\n\nIf I don’t find her, gonna tie that noose\n\nI quit my job and packed my car\n\nLeft in a hurry, and I've sure come far\n\nDriving fast with no headlights\n\nI’m wide awake, I say her name into the night\n\nOh, I'll find a way, I say your name into the night\n\n\n\nI don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am\n\nI don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am\n\nI don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am\n\nI don’t know who I am, I don’t know where I am",
