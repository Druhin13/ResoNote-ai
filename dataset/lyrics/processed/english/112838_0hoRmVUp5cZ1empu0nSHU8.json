  "lyrics": "A love song was playing on the radio\r\nIt made me kind of sad because it made me think of you\r\nAnd I wonder how you're doing but I wish I didn't care\r\nBecause I gave you all I had and got the worst of you\r\nBy the way, I forgive you\n\nAfter all, maybe I should thank you\n\nFor giving me what I've found\n\nCause without you around\n\nI've been doing just fine\n\nExcept for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)\n\n\n\nAnd didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading\n\nDid it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned\n\nThey told me the best revenge would be a life well lived\n\nAnd the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn\n\n\n\nBy the way, I forgive you\n\nAfter all, maybe I should thank you\n\nFor giving me what I've found\n\nCause without you around\n\nI've been doing just fine\n\nExcept for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)\n\nOh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)\n\n\n\nWhen I woke up in the morning I was choking on some words\n\nThere were things unsaid between us, there were things you never told\n\nNow that's twice you broke my heart now, the first was way back then\n\nAnd to know that you're still unhappy only makes it break again\n\n\n\nBy the way, I forgive you\n\nAfter all, maybe I should thank you\n\nFor giving me what I've found\n\nCause without you around\n\nI've been doing just fine\n\n\n\nBy the way, I forgive you\n\nI never will, never will forget you\n\nFor giving me what I've found\n\nCause without you around\n\nI've been doing just fine\n\nExcept for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)\n\nOh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)\n\nOh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)",
