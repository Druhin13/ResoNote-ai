  "lyrics": "They can make cars drive themselves\r\nAnd prove time-travel ain't crazy as hell\r\nThey've even got a pill to make a soft package hard\r\nBut as far as we've came\r\nWhen it comes to love and to blame\r\nAnd the breaking of a loved heart\n\nI think we're sorely lacking methods\n\nSo I'm going with old time-tested:\n\nA jukebox and a bar\n\n\n\nOne pushes me up the mountain\n\nAnd one rolls me down the hill\n\nWhile I sit in a phosphorescent dark\n\nSo you can keep your fancy potions\n\nAnd your incandescent notions\n\nAs for me and my barely-beating heart\n\nThere's no better prescription\n\nFor my broken disposition\n\nThan a jukebox and a bar\n\n\n\nWe got pinpoint GPS\n\nAll you need is an address\n\nBut her love is the one thing I can't find\n\nMeanwhile no one has a clue\n\nHow to make her memory turn loose\n\nSo much for academic minds\n\n\n\nOne pushes me up the mountain\n\nAnd one rolls me down the hill\n\nWhile I sit here in a phosphorescent dark\n\nSo you can keep your fancy potions\n\nAnd your incandescent notions\n\nAs for me and my barely-beating heart\n\nThere's no better prescription\n\nFor my the human condition\n\nThan a jukebox and a bar\n\n\n\nMay look like music, booze, and beer\n\nThere's a whole more goin' on in here\n\nThan a jukebox and a bar",
