  "lyrics": "When your mouth is as big as the Rolling Stones\r\nAnd your self-control, relative unknown\r\nAnd you can cut holes into everyone\r\nOr you can just shoot hoops through the summer sun\r\nI know you paid for the room with a view\n\nBut got one that pointed at you\n\nSo when you skip to the front of the queue\n\nYou can tell them that this one's for you\n\nYeah, tell them that this one's for you\n\n\n\nI know people think your mind is a ski resort\n\nBut the art of deception is a contact sport\n\nSo if you wanna make amends then you make a list\n\nYou don't draw blanks on the back of your fist\n\n\n\nIn the restaurant at the top of an ivory tower\n\nWhere the ropes stop turning just to save our power\n\nBut if you ask her politely you know\n\nThat I can't get my knife up at first\n\nThen the world might revolve around her's\n\nYeah, the world should revolve around her's\n\n\n\nAnd if there's no reservation for two\n\nBut the hostess is someone you knew\n\nThen skip to the front of the queue\n\nAnd tell them that this one's for you\n\nGo tell them that this one's for you\n\n\n\nBut when I float to the top I tried a lucky guess\n\nBut I only go fishing for negative press\n\nCause I've been to the bottom and the bottom is free\n\nBut the easy way out ain't tailor-made\n\nAnd I've been to the bottom with you\n\nBut we just do what we want to do\n\nSo let's skip to the front of the queue\n\nAnd tell them that this one's for you\n\nWe'll tell them that this one's for you",
