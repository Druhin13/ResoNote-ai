  "lyrics": "Chris\r\nI'm gone in a flick, but back in a second\r\nWith salted skin, rash for no reason\r\nBoys are loading their arms, girls gasp with envy\r\nF-f-for whom are they mimicking endlessly?\n\nSame old sadness in small lumps on my jaw\n\nFor lusting after is the usual freak show\n\nMay your girl come, birdie die under this spur\n\nF-f-fingers angrily sunk on the jugular\n\n\n\nGirlfriend\n\nDon't feel like a girlfriend\n\nBut lover\n\nDamn, I'd be your lover\n\n\n\nGirlfriend\n\nDon't feel like a girlfriend\n\nBut lover\n\nDamn, I'd be your lover\n\n\n\nYes sir, I am wet, for I abandoned my fame in the lake\n\nLet's see now how fast you're breathing and how long this will all take\n\nThose who used to pass by me think they are baffling a liar\n\nF-f-fuck is you? You don't even taste much better!\n\nCame back steaming in sweats in the morning\n\nI muscled in for I wanted to hold him\n\nThen shriveled to let those bird-dogs rage through\n\nF-f-f is me? F-f-fuck is you? F-f-fuck is you now\n\n\n\n[Christine and the Queens & DâM-FunK:]\n\nGirlfriend\n\nDon't feel like a girlfriend\n\nBut lover\n\nDamn, I'd be your lover\n\n\n\nGirlfriend\n\nDon't feel like a girlfriend\n\nBut lover\n\nDamn, I'd be your lover\n\n\n\nChris, I don't know why you trippin'\n\n\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché...\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché...\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché...\n\n(You got to keep on rollin' girl)\n\n(Keep rollin', rollin')\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché... (B-b-b-baby)\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché... (B-b-b-baby)\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché... (B-b-b-baby)\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché... (Oh no)\n\nTouché, touché, touché, touché...\n\n\n\nYeah",
