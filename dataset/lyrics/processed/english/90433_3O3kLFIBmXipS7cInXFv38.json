  "lyrics": "She graduated high school I bought her a trailer\r\nIn a little park by the side of the road\r\nI could've had the army, I could've had the navy\r\nBut no, I had to go for a mobile home\r\nYeah I guess, I gave it all for you, babe\r\nThere wasn't room in that trailer for two, babe\n\nI kept up with my interest, I kept up with my payments\n\nShe never said goodbye, I never asked why\n\nMan, we used to dance to Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nBoy she used to look so good at times\n\nBut I guess, I gave it all to you, babe\n\nThere's not room in no trailer for two, babe\n\nWell I guess, I gave it all for you, babe\n\nAll for you and your trailer too, babe",
