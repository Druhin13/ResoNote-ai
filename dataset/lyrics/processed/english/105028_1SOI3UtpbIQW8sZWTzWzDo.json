  "lyrics": "Held on to hope like a noose, like a rope\r\nGod and medicine take no mercy on him\r\nPoisoned his blood, and burned out his throat\r\nEnough is enough, he's a long way from home\r\nDays of my youth wasted on a selfish fool\n\nWho ran for the hills from the hand you were dealt\n\nI flew far away, as far as I could go\n\nYour time is running out\n\nAnd I'm a long way from home\n\n\n\nLaid up in bed, you were laid up in bed\n\nHolding the pain like you're holding your breath\n\nI prayed you could sleep, sleep like a stone\n\nYou're right next to me\n\nBut you're a long way from home\n\n\n\nHospital gowns never fit like they should\n\nWe yelled at the nurse, didn't do any good\n\nMore morphine, the last words you moaned\n\nAt last I was sure\n\nThat you weren't far away from home",
