  "lyrics": "A lonely man I know myself to be\r\nIt's not as bad\r\nas some things I have seen.\r\nThe picture painted here\r\nis not a dream\r\nThe only reality\n\nis the way it seems.\n\n\n\nThe happier you fly\n\nThe sadder you fall\n\nThe laughter in your eyes\n\nIs never all.\n\n\n\nGive me strength to move along.\n\nGive me strength\n\nto leave my sweetheart.\n\n\n\nI'm riding down this wet road\n\nin my old car\n\nThe moon is almost full\n\nexcept for stars.\n\nThe party ended\n\nlong before the night\n\nShe made me feel alive\n\nand that's all right.\n\n\n\nThe happier you fly\n\nThe sadder you fall\n\nThe laughter in your eyes\n\nIs never all.\n\n\n\nGive me strength to move along.\n\nGive me strength\n\nto leave while she's gone.\n\n\n\nThe happier you fly\n\nThe sadder you fall\n\nThe laughter in your eyes\n\nIs never all.\n\n\n\nGive me strength to move along.\n\nGive me strength to move along.\n\nGive me strength to move along.",
