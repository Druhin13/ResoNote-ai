  "lyrics": "Reaching under water, memories dissipate\r\nEyes begin to open, darkness drifts away\r\nTime and space like roses, whose petals drop and fade\r\nAnd fall into the light as it dreams of yesterday\r\nToo much love is not enough for us\n\nI was once too blind to see\n\n\n\nThere is nothing sacred, only heaven knows\n\nStop time to watch the sun and look into your soul\n\n\n\nToo much love is not enough for us\n\nI was once too blind to see\n\nToo much hope will never be enough\n\nIt's become so clear to me\n\n\n\n\n\nToo much love is not enough for us\n\nI was once too blind to see\n\nToo much hope will never be enough\n\nThe truth is clear to me",
