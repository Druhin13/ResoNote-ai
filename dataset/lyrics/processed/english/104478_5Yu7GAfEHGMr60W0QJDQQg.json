  "lyrics": "Waves crashing on her feet\r\nStanding in some rolled up jeans\r\nMaking tracks in the sand\r\nIt's like she's living in a photograph\r\nBut disappearing silouhette\r\nFlip flop in her hands\n\n\n\nAnd every kiss is burnt and hot\n\nI can't let them go to waste\n\nLet's say the night is all that we've got\n\nAnd I'm ready for the chase\n\n\n\nWe can be sun downers, edge of towners\n\nWaiting on a spark\n\nSilent sounders, come unwounders\n\nTangled in the dark\n\nLike the moon is hanging lets keep this dream awake\n\nLet's go out into the AM\n\nBut tonight let's be some sun downers (sun downers)\n\n\n\nBlue gives into the black\n\nRed lips just like a match\n\nThat sets me on fire\n\nWhile the whole falls asleep\n\nEvery look that you're giving me\n\nIs taking me higher\n\n\n\nAnd every kiss is burnt and hot\n\nI can't let them go to waste\n\nAnd once we start, we can't stop\n\nLike 80 with no brakes\n\n\n\nWe can be sun downers, edge of towners\n\nWaiting on a spark\n\nSilent sounders, come unwounders\n\nTangled in the dark\n\nLike the moon is hanging, lets keep this dream awake\n\nLet's go out into the AM\n\nBut tonight let's be some sun downers (sun downers)\n\n\n\nWe can be the only two up\n\nWhen they close down this town\n\nLets just live it up til it comes back around\n\nWe can be sundowners\n\nWe can be come unwounders\n\n\n\nSundowners, edge of towners\n\nWaiting on a spark\n\nSilent sounders, come unwounders\n\nTangled in the dark\n\nLike the moon is hanging, lets keep this dream awake\n\nLet's go out until the AM\n\nBut tonight let's be some sundowners\n\n\n\nLet's just be some come unwounders\n\nWe can be some play it louders\n\nGotta start sundowners\n\n(Yeah) Sundowners\n\n\n\nSundowners\n\n\n\nLet's just be some sundowners",
