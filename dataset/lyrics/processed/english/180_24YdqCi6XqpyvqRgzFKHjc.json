  "lyrics": "We used to talk about a sun machine\r\nIf we could flip the lights then our love would never end\r\nYou were like the American Dream\r\nMade me want things I don't really need\r\nWe used to ride around on rollerblades\r\nYou kissed me on the mouth and my pupils dilated\n\nIn my trance you were a little babe\n\nShrinking like a flower in the rain\n\n\n\nDid I make you mean, or were you always that way?\n\nYeah unfortunately, I can’t turn lemons into lemonade\n\nBut I let you know how much you hurt me\n\nWith a really really long goodbye\n\nFor real this is goodbye, now for some lemonade\n\n\n\nNow I’d like to talk about the submarine\n\nAnd the big blue whale who got stranded by the sonar\n\nIt makes me think about your laser beam\n\nYou screamed at me until I played the part\n\nI thought I needed you in every way\n\nI woke up in some pain and I texted you by mistake\n\nHonestly things are gravy\n\nCan you help me jog my memory?\n\n\n\nDid I make you mean, or were you always that way?\n\nYeah unfortunately, I can’t turn lemons into lemonade\n\nBut I let you know how much you hurt me\n\nWith a really really long goodbye\n\nFor real this is goodbye\n\nNow for some lemonade\n\n\n\nWe used to talk about a sun machine\n\nIf we could flip the lights then our love would never end\n\nYou were like the American dream\n\nMade me want things I don't really need\n\nNow for some lemonade\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a really really long goodbye\n\nFor real this is goodbye\n\nNow for some lemonade",
