  "lyrics": "I paint my lips red, I turn my own head\r\nDon't need nobody's help, zipping up my own dress\r\nPay my own tab, with my own cash, unattached\r\nSometimes the world alone, sounds like a sad song\r\nWhy's it gotta be, cause what I really need is a reset\r\nAnd a deep breath, yeah\n\n\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break, out late\n\nSolo on a saturday night\n\nGoing out without a plus one, I'm done\n\nFalling over pickup lines\n\nI'm single for the summer, I won't rebound\n\nOne lover to another, or be tied down\n\nI'm sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break\n\n\n\nIt's just a little phase, give me a little space\n\nYou might see through it, but I'm putting on a poker face\n\nGive a love a rest, between my ex, and my next\n\n\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break, out late\n\nSolo on a saturday night\n\nGoing out without a plus one, I'm done\n\nFalling over pickup lines\n\nI'm single for the summer, I won't rebound\n\nOne lover to another, or be tied down\n\n'Til im sleeping like a queen in a California king I made (I made, I made)\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break\n\n\n\nLove, I'm over you (love, I'm over you)\n\nIt's long overdue\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break (I'm single for the summer, I won't rebound)\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break\n\n\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break, out late\n\nSolo on a saturday night\n\nGoing out without a plus one, I'm done\n\nFalling over pickup lines\n\nI'm single for the summer, I won't rebound\n\nOne lover to another, or be tied down\n\n'Til Im sleeping like a queen in a california king I made (I made, I made)\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break\n\nI think it's time to take a heart break",
