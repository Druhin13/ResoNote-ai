  "lyrics": "You may want to think twice before you laugh at somebody… 'cause they might just follow you home and kill you\r\nI got these rappers scatterin' like shatterin' your nose bones and splatterin'\r\nBlood in front of a hypochondriac with rare African\r\nForms of an airborne pathogen passin' through a sneeze\r\nWhile I'm smashin' through emcees to bring the masses to their knees\n\nI passed all my degrees and handcrafted a masterpiece\n\nNow I'm after that mac-n-cheese to make money like Maccabees\n\nImagine all these maggots like magnets attractin' G's\n\nSwear that swag is homemade when they studyin' Apathy's\n\nThey pacin' back and forth on the stage like they half deceased\n\nOr they speakin' in Japanese or they stuck on a bag of trees\n\nOr they fuck up lyrics and freeze… suckers are so predictable\n\nI miss when it was dope to be original\n\nI'm so heartbroken I part the ocean like Moses to escape\n\nBut they threw up the bat signal so I'm goin' to get my cape\n\nI'm gettin' my old tapes and all them heavy ass crates\n\nScrutinizin' all my mistakes, I'll do whatever it takes\n\n\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnd think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnother day, another night, another dollar bill\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnd think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnother day, another night\n\n\n\nI sit and stare at the disproportionate portrait of portions that rappers speak upon\n\nThat sneak up on Ponzis that prompt me to palm, my speakers drawn\n\nFond of lyricism, subject matter with substance gathered close\n\nI tend to douse 'em with both\n\nInstead of facetious songs that bottom feed methodically\n\nLike Constantine tricked us by mixin' Paganism with modern Christian theology\n\nGod to me is probably somethin' you never seen, let it ring\n\nMy lyrics come to life like that rabbit crafted from Velveteen\n\nMy self-esteem was punctured, lungs drippin' in acetone\n\nMy Ex told me, \"Stop feelin' sorry, get off your ass your grown\"\n\nThese other rappers suck dick, in fact it's known\n\nCheeks inflated like them jazz musicians blowin' the saxophone\n\nThat cast a stone? You plastic clones adapt poems\n\nLike diggin' for fossil fuels extracted out of Jurassic bones\n\nYou excavated a style that I encoded\n\nSpittin' rhymes back at me like I wasn't the one who wrote it, motherfucker\n\n\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnd think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnother day, another night, another dollar bill\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnd think about all of them rappers that I wanna kill\n\nRise and shine, write a rhyme\n\nAnother day, another night, another dollar bill",
