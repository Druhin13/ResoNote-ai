  "lyrics": "You know all my habits\r\nAnd the ways I wreak havoc\r\nBut you know how to handle me\r\nYou do it so effortlessly\r\nWe always mess around\n\nBut I'm never really sure\n\nIf I am on your mind\n\nOr imagining it all\n\nWhen I'm with you I forget\n\nThat you aren't mine just yet\n\nAnd I know if I say a thing\n\nI might lose you wondering, that…\n\n\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you, I'll give you the world\n\nI'll give, I'll give you\n\nI'll give, I'll give you\n\n\n\nI know all your hang-ups\n\nWhy ruin what's simple? (simple)\n\nMake every excuse you know\n\nBut the feeling won't let go\n\n\n\nThere's a thousand reasons why\n\nI circle back to you\n\nDon't always understand\n\nBut what's a girl to do\n\nWhen I'm with you I forget\n\nThat we aren't there just yet\n\nAnd I know if I say a thing\n\nI might lose you questioning, that…\n\n\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world\n\nIf you take a chance with me\n\nI'll give you, I'll give you the world\n\nI'll give, I'll give you\n\nI'll give, I'll give you\n\n\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world (I'll give)\n\nI'll give you the world, I'll give you the world (I'll give you)\n\nI'll give you the world, and I'll give you the world (I'll give)\n\nI'll give you, I'll give you, I'll give you… the world (I'll give you)",
