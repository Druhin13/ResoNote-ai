  "lyrics": "Your eyes don't lie\r\nA pair of daggers cutting through my mind\r\nYour stare it rips a hole into my life\r\nAm I supposed to leave this all behind?\r\nIt's on my skin\r\nYour scent is poison when I breathe you in\n\nIt's there with every single breath I take\n\nIf this is it then don't resuscitate\n\n\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time\n\nI'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine\n\nIt's on my skin\n\nYour scent is poison when I breathe you in\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time)\n\n\n\nDon't you speak\n\nYou think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak\n\nI guarantee I won't be losing sleep\n\n'Cause you're the one that made this end complete\n\n\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time\n\nI'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine\n\nDon't you speak\n\nYou think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time (for the very last time)\n\n\n\nBreathing\n\nI'm still breathing\n\nI'm still breathing\n\nI'm still breathing\n\n\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time\n\nI'm not gonna punish myself when I know that the fault is not mine\n\nDon't you speak\n\nYou think I'm hurting but I'm not that weak\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time\n\nI've gone and put myself through this for the very last time",
