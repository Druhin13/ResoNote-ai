  "lyrics": "I can’t begin to explain\r\nHow we disassemble\r\nThe parts and frame\r\nMaybe it’s the same late morning?\r\nThe same no-show?\r\n“It’s the same fucking habits…”\n\nI guess we don’t know\n\n\n\nAll of this is tearing us apart\n\nI don’t know where us or this start\n\nAll of this is tearing us apart\n\nI don’t know where us or this start\n\n\n\nIf there’s anyone near when we collide\n\nWe throw them in the middle\n\nThey can pick sides\n\n\n\nAs the plans turn into compromise\n\nThe promises all turn to lies\n\nThe spite builds up and I can’t get through\n\nPassive me, aggressive you\n\nI know I nag, I moan I know\n\nBut with a plan like this it’s way too slow\n\nIn the time it took to get this bad\n\nI could’ve made this work but all I had\n\nWas the hope that pieces would take shape\n\nAnd we could watch them all fall into place\n\nFall into place\n\n\n\nAll of this is tearing us apart\n\nI don’t know where us or this start\n\nAll of this is tearing us apart\n\nI don’t know where us or this start",
