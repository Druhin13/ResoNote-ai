  "lyrics": "If you come close I'll tell you a little secret\r\nThe best ones you can learn from are, your enemies\r\nWhen it comes to know and defeat your weakness\r\nYou need to be the hunter and the prey\r\nUh\n\nRemembering the days\n\nWe would be lying on the grass out in the sun\n\nUh\n\nFelt good to be friend back then\n\nBut now we've built a fence of differences\n\n\n\nNow please present me what I've lost\n\nAnd I'll portray your failures\n\nSo that we can be complete\n\n\n\nIt's like a magic mirror\n\nColliding mind's reflection\n\nThey are the sacred window\n\nReveals the other side\n\nSo be the magic mirror\n\nThe other eye's perception\n\nThey are the sacred window\n\nGrant that light to shine\n\n\n\nYou and I know what's the best for both of us\n\nEven though our thoughts are not the same\n\nLiving in worlds\n\nThat might be slightly different\n\nLet us build a bridge, unite our ways!\n\n\n\nUh\n\nRemembering the days\n\nWe would be lying on the grass out in the sun\n\n\n\nSo, every time you point your fingers\n\nYou deny your own mistakes\n\nNow who's the one to blame?\n\n\n\nI see the magic mirror\n\nColliding mind's reflection\n\nThey are the sacred window\n\nReveals the other side\n\nSo be the magic mirror\n\nThe other eye's perception\n\nThey are the sacred window\n\nLeave that light inside\n\n\n\nI see the magic mirror\n\nColliding mind's reflection\n\nThey are the sacred window\n\nReveals the other side\n\nSo be the magic mirror\n\nThe other eye's perception\n\nThey are the sacred window\n\nGrant that light to shine",
