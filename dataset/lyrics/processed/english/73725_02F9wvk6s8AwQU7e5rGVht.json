  "lyrics": "Illuminate the sky with thousands of bright lights\r\nA warning sign sent from the Gods\r\nHear the sound of marching from devils\r\nThey shadow the here and now\r\nTurn the page, expose deceit through the years\n\nFlip a coin, watch them shed crocodile tears\n\n\n\nIt’s like a spreading disease, an arrow through the achilles\n\nTongues twisted like cyclones, epitaph on a tombstone\n\nThis fable is plaguing me\n\n\n\nI foresee the end of humanity, the price of their prophecy: a reckoning\n\n\n\nFuck the things they preach\n\nThe wise against the meek\n\nAll surrounding me\n\nThey bring us to our knees\n\n\n\nExpose deceit through the years\n\nWatch them shed crocodile tears\n\n\n\nIt’s like a spreading disease, an arrow through the achilles\n\nTongues twisted like cyclones, epitaph on a tombstone\n\nThis fable is plaguing me\n\nTrue north on a compass\n\nAs vast as the sea\n\nWe’ll find a way to dissipate\n\nThe veil of reality\n\n\n\nIlluminate the sky",
