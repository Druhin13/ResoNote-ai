  "lyrics": "They say all roads lead back to home\r\nThat ain't where I wanna go\r\nOr where I wanna be\r\nAll these places that I been\r\nAll these faces that I seen\r\nNow they're all in front of me\n\n\n\nHow long till I get where I'm goin'\n\nHow far will I go, ooh\n\nRun until the street signs are foreign\n\nKeep runnin' in the right direction\n\nFade out but the lights are still glowin'\n\nTell me where to go, ooh\n\nHow long will I run without knowin'\n\nIf I'm runnin' in the right direction\n\n\n\n(Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right)\n\n\n\nHotel rooms where I used to stay\n\nAll feel so far away\n\nThan my closest anything\n\n(Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right)\n\nThey ask me what's my deep desire\n\nI throw up my hands, say \"I don't mind\"\n\nAs long as I don't fall behind\n\n\n\nHow long till I get where I'm goin'\n\nHow far will I go, ooh\n\nRun until the street signs are foreign\n\nKeep runnin' in the right direction\n\nFade out but the lights are still glowin'\n\nTell me where to go, ooh\n\nHow long will I run without knowin'\n\nIf I'm runnin' in the right direction\n\n\n\n(Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right)\n\n(Runnin' in the right, runnin' in the right direction)\n\n\n\nI wanna feel that high\n\nNot just a lifetime waiting\n\nGotta keep on asking why\n\n(Runnin' in the right direction)\n\n\n\nHow long till I get where I'm goin'\n\nRun until the street signs are foreign\n\nFade out but the lights are still glowin'\n\nTell me where to go, ooh\n\nHow long will I run without knowin'\n\nIf I'm runnin' in the right direction",
