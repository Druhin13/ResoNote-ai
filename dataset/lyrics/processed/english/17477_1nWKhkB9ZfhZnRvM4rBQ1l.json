  "lyrics": "But you are more than a descendant of a slave\r\nTonna, I hate that I have to talk to you about this\r\nYou just a boy\r\nWhen does a boy become a man? How do you know?\r\nI think it's when you can honor the cloud of witnesses who came before you\r\nAnd respond to hatred with love that transforms\n\n\n\nUh, black boy, black boy, did you know that the world is yours?\n\nYour Father built it, presented it to you without a blemish\n\nYour Father's gifted, your Father's gift is a sinless existence\n\nNo cause for tears when your eye lid is dripping\n\nWild up with liquid as your soul cries, water falls from those eyes\n\nCheek rivers roll by, dropping to the concrete, making a rose rise\n\nBlack boy, black boy, did you know that the world is yours?\n\nYour Father built it, and he made it with His hands alone\n\nAnd then He left you with Emmanuel\n\nHow to produce fruit\n\nEngage your culture that can't elope\n\nLet 'em know that the antidote ain't the Pope\n\nHow to produce truth\n\nCall 'em like you see 'em like a camera phone\n\nFacetime as a luxury and a loan\n\nYou got it but you can't have it, what an anecdote\n\nBlack boy, black boy\n\nYou can waste it, you can kill it, you can use it, uh\n\nYou can spend it on the worthy or the useless\n\nBut you'll never get it back like that old thing\n\nOr the Love from that song that En Vogue sings\n\nSo what you finna do with these seconds, it's thanksgiving\n\nTo the one that's serving blessings\n\nOr you wastin' all this time you got to invest in your stuff and how you dressin', haha\n\nWhat, you tryna get the yams on the first date?\n\nFor your plans 'cause you slammed on your first plate\n\nYou ain't notice was a gift in the first place\n\nWhy you think he gave grace for you first, ayy\n\nIt's all yours, but it's all in time\n\nSome stuff you gotta wait for, so fall in line, uh huh\n\n\n\nUh, black boy, black boy, did you know that the world is yours?\n\nAnd don't let 'em tell you different\n\nYeah, I know that your father made you different\n\nBut not less than the rest 'cause of your shade of pigment\n\nYou better light, remember that when the shade is given\n\nYou wasn't made to fit in, small expectations given\n\nBy the thoughts of baby homo sapiens with jaded memories\n\nClouded by decades of a racist system\n\nTo a child of the Savior risen\n\nYeah, that's all I got\n\nUh, black boy, black boy, it's yours\n\n\n\nWhen you can see the wickedness of the land that you live in and still stand for truth and righteousness, your ancestors, son, they lived and they died, prayin' for you, that you would be free, that you would love, that you would fight, that you would protect, that you would strive, that you would grow. Black man, don't you know the world is yours?\n\n\n\nBlack man, black man, you know it's still yours, right?\n\nLife came, death left, so your birthright\n\nYou never really outgrow it but could easily forget it if you're not knowin' history has tried to dumb you down\n\nWith whips and chains to keep you from the underground\n\nGive you the runaround\n\nHave you thinkin' what's under your crown\n\nIt's not a kings mind and your worth is what you pick up from the ground, it's false\n\nBlack man, black man, you forgot you was a king, huh?\n\nAnd your kingship, it's from the Kinged One\n\nYou was a slave, smart, so son, please don't let that change what your free dumb (freedom)\n\nEmancipation was gifted, so each man pay son attention\n\nSo he can raise younger generation racin' for image\n\nImagine a masses of masses making the killing\n\nThen Abraham Lincoln, a modern Moses for most us slaves leaving Egypt, let us go\n\nWe dipped, then we meet Jim\n\nRe-lynched on tree limb that belonged to the Crow\n\nFrom the Crow to ghetto, we still hear the echoes\n\nOf \"We Shall Overcome\" in Ma Harriet's strong falsetto\n\nBlack man, black man, you know that the world is yours?\n\nYour Father built it with all of these cards against ya\n\nOne thing you cannot forget is, you was made in your Father's image: king",
