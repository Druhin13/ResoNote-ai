  "lyrics": "If these walls could talk, I bet they'd sing a song\r\nOne that's sad and lonely and a little too long\r\nAbout a woman who said she was through\r\nAnd a man who can't move on\r\nIf these walls could talk, I bet they'd sing a song\n\nAnd if these walls had ears, I bet they'd hear your name\n\nFor I cried it out so many nights in vain\n\nAnd each night, the sounds grow louder\n\nWith each bittersweet refrain\n\nIf these walls had ears, I bet they'd hear your name\n\n\n\nAnd if these walls had eyes, I bet they'd cry for you\n\nFor they've witnessed everything you put me through\n\nThey can see the sadness\n\nGrowing in this broken-hearted fool\n\nAnd if these walls had eyes, I bet they'd cry for you\n\n\n\nIf these walls could talk, I bet they'd sing a song\n\nOne that's sad and lonely and a little too long\n\n'Bout a woman who said she was through\n\nAnd a man who can't move on\n\nIf these walls could talk, I bet they'd sing a song\n\nIf these walls could talk, I bet they'd sing a song",
