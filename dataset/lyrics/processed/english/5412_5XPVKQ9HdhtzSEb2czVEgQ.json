  "lyrics": "Nineteen eighty-nine, eleven o five\r\nFirst time I opened my eyes\r\nYou were there\r\nThirteen, got a dream, I wanted to sing\r\nThat night changed everything 'cause\r\nYou were there\n\n\n\nEvery snapshot of this crazy life\n\nYou've been faithful all these years of mi-i-ine\n\n\n\nYou were there\n\nFor every mile of every road\n\nEvery right and wrong\n\nYou were there\n\nFor shattered and for beautiful\n\nCheering me on\n\nAll along, all along\n\nYou were there... all along\n\nAll along... You were there\n\n\n\nI met a girl when I was fifteen, I believed\n\nSomeday she'd marry me\n\nTwenty-two, we said I do\n\nAnd You were there\n\nYou called us to Tennessee\n\nWe went on nothing but faith and pennies\n\nWe did impossible things 'cause...\n\n\n\nYou were there\n\nFor every mile of every road\n\nEvery right and wrong\n\nYou were there\n\nFor shattered and for beautiful\n\nCheering me on\n\nAll along, all along\n\nYou were there... all along\n\nYou were there... all along\n\nYou were there...\n\n\n\nFrom that first breath until now\n\nAnd all those years in between\n\nMy life is proof that You had\n\nYour hand on everything\n\n\n\nYou were there\n\nFor every mile of every road\n\nEvery right and wrong\n\nYou were there\n\nFor shattered and for beautiful\n\nCheering me on\n\nAll along, all along\n\nYou were there... all along\n\nYou were there... all along\n\nYou were there...\n\n\n\nYou... all along\n\nYou were there\n\nYou... all along\n\nYou were there",
