  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Cold Blood par Bruno Major\r\nCome here boy, rest your head for awhile\nI know you've been traveling a long time\nCome here boy, sing your songs with a smile\nWatch me turn water into wine\n\nIntoxicating creation and endless elation\nYou'll see the stars before sunrise\nCome here boy, give me your soul for awhile\nYou make me go weak at the knees\n\nIn cold blood, I will eat you up\nI'll tell you that I love you while I lower you six feet into the ground\nIn cold blood, I will let you down\nI will swear that I don't know you when you turn your back\n\nAnd when you're not around\nIn cold blood, in cold blood\nIn cold blood, in cold blood\n\nDon't look down, it's a long, long way from home\nNo one's ever survived before\nWearing your crown\nAssume your throne\nOne day all this will be yours\n\nIntoxicating creation and endless elation\nYou'll see the stars before sunrise\nCome here boy, give me your soul for awhile\nYou make me go weak at the knees\n\nIn cold blood, I will eat you up\nI'll tell you that I love you while I lower you six feet into the ground\n\nIn cold blood, I will let you down\nI will swear that I don't know you when you turn your back\nWhen you're not around\nIn cold blood, in cold blood\nIn cold blood, in cold blood",
