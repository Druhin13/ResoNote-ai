  "lyrics": "I wonder if you saw that I was sorry for the beating of my heart\r\nWhen it woke you in the car park\r\nAnd maybe I should tell you\r\nThat I’ve villainised by body for too long\r\nWould it help you find excuses to move on?\r\nLike I needed more excuses to be stronger\n\n\n\nI’m no mother\n\nBut I’ve done a lot\n\nTo prove to those I love that they are good enough\n\nI don’t believe in luck so I am giving up\n\n\n\nI hope to find a reason for my fear of feelings leaving at the start\n\nIt makes my sleeping harder\n\nI don’t know much about you\n\nSo I’m trying not to doubt you, but in time\n\nI know you’ll let me down and that is fine\n\nA feeling I can’t shake, it’s getting stronger\n\n\n\nI’m no mother\n\nBut I’ve done a lot\n\nTo prove to those I love that they are good enough\n\nI don’t believe in luck\n\nI don’t believe in much\n\nLeave it all to trust or start to give it up",
