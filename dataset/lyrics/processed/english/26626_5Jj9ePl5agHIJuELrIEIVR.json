  "lyrics": "You should keep voice on the line\r\nStill has the same old feelin'\r\nSaid I was the year of your life\r\nHave to say I agree\r\nI love the nostalgia, no waiting here\r\nYou're like a poison that gets into me\n\n'Cause I know I don't really miss you\n\nI miss the memories\n\nI'm diluted by own fantasy\n\nGot me questioning my sanity\n\nI'm intoxicated, you know I'm [?]\n\nSo you keep on pouring that same old love\n\nBut I know I don't really miss you,\n\nI miss what we had before\n\n\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nA burst of your love\n\nI'm sober enough\n\nI can't take the highs\n\nWhen the lows are this low\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\n\n\nYou're making me sick to my stomach\n\nYou're bad right to the core\n\nYou wanna bring up our past\n\nStarting me off\n\nYou're getting me weak, weak to the bones\n\nTrying so hard to get me second thoughts\n\nBut I've had more than I should\n\nI poured down every drop!\n\n\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nA burst of your love\n\nI'm sober enough\n\nI can't take the highs\n\nWhen the lows are this low\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\n\n\nHey, you wanna make amends\n\nCome back and break my bed\n\nI know in my heart you won't change!\n\n\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nA burst of your love\n\nI'm sober enough\n\nI can't take the highs\n\nWhen the lows are this low\n\nI'm hungover you\n\nI'm hungover you",
