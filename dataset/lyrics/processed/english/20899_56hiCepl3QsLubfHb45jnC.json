  "lyrics": "What is that noise that you hear in the trees?\r\nIt's the words from the day, it's the gods, it's the breeze\r\nIt's the night that follows the day\r\nOh, I love you tomorrow, so don't go away\r\nWhat is that sight that you never did see?\r\nThe one founded by fathers and scattered by dreams\n\nOh, the thoughts that never left you alone\n\nOh, tell me a story before you go home\n\n\n\nWill you fall upon me with your heart full of light beams?\n\nCan I rest upon you when I'm gone in my daydreams?\n\nWhen I am gone\n\n\n\nWhat is that life that you never did lead?\n\nThe one written by lovers and lost overseas\n\nThe one spare, that stayed in your bones\n\nOh tell me your worries before the world knows\n\n\n\nWill you fall upon me with your heart full of light beams?\n\nCan I rest upon you when I'm gone in my daydreams?\n\nWhen I am gone\n\nWhen I'm gone-g-gone, gone gone gone gone\n\nCan I rest upon you?\n\nWhen I'm gone-g-gone, gone gone gone gone\n\n\n\nWhat is that wish that you never did make?\n\nThe one lost to the winds and the honest mistakes\n\nYour one dream that never found the right day\n\nOh, I love you forever, so don't go away\n\n\n\nWill you fall upon me with your heart full of light beams?\n\nCan I rest upon you when I'm gone in my daydreams?\n\nWhen I am gone\n\nWhen I'm gone-g-gone, gone gone gone gone\n\nCan I rest with you?\n\nWhen I'm gone-g-gone, gone gone gone gone\n\nCan I rest with you?\n\nWhen I'm gone-g-gone, gone gone gone gone\n\nCan I rest with you?\n\nWhen I'm gone-g-gone, gone gone gone gone",
