  "lyrics": "One day, the light of love\r\nThough it may seem far away\r\nWill shine again in your eyes\r\n(Transcend and rise above)\r\nBut there’s only one dream\n\nAnd it’s been ripped at the seam\n\nThis world will end in ruin\n\n(And I’ll lose all I love)\n\n\n\nStifle all your doubt\n\nLet your lust cry out\n\nI will help you swallow your hesitation\n\nSo trust me\n\n\n\n‘Cause you yearn with greed\n\nThough your heart may bleed\n\nWill we fade away from this world\n\nWith no hope to hold onto?\n\n\n\nI remember you from a dream I thought was truth\n\nYou bright with magic, and I, blinded by my youth\n\nAll I wish is for your hand to hold, you see\n\nOnly your smile kills the dark in me\n\n\n\nWith these hands, I’ve tried to hold what I cannot seize\n\nI’m like a rose thrown into a violent breeze\n\nAll my strength blown away, with my heart I will stay\n\nPraying for light, guiding my wish with all my might\n\n\n\nOne day, it will come true\n\nThat wish you have inside you\n\nTo save the one that you love\n\n(Is that a selfish act)\n\n\n\nIt will capture you heart\n\nThis love born under the stars\n\nYou’ll say things you’ve never heard\n\n(Just how will you react?)\n\n\n\nIf I can go on and not lose my way\n\nI will sacrifice all my heart and let it fray to pieces\n\nWhat I really need is a spell to cast\n\nTo stand up against all the pain and fear that will always last\n\n\n\nYou are still lost in a dream, like a memory\n\nI’m not the same, it would seem I’m still wide awake\n\nUntil we open our eyes at the same time\n\nI will keep marching on into your light\n\n\n\nWill these hands, I’ve picked a rose and have stopped its life\n\nOnly now I understand, it’s not what’s right\n\nDeep inside, I‘m alive, for my love, I’ll survive\n\nI won’t regret making this sinful wish of mine\n\n\n\nThe stories that I heard as a child kept me dreaming\n\nWhere magic runs free and stars held captive remain always gleaming\n\nThe fairytales I loved have taught me (have taught me)\n\nNo matter what hurdles there may be, your wish comes true\n\n(Was I a fool to trust in those lies?)\n\n\n\nIn the night, wild with fright, the old magic stirs\n\nBlooming with grace, it will rise up to meet your face\n\nWith your hands, you can change this whole world of yours\n\nEverything that you wish for is in your grasp\n\n\n\nAll I want is to forever dream with you\n\nTo live a life where all of me is alive\n\nDeep inside, I will give all my love, just to live\n\nI won’t regret making this sinful wish of mine",
