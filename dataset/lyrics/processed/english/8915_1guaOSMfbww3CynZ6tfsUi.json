  "lyrics": "I don't believe\r\nMy will's quite free\r\nI'm half machine\r\nAt least half steam\r\nAquinas, call on me\r\nHow many angels on the head of your pin?\n\nAnybody in stilettos can answer that old thing\n\nIt's one for the right foot, one for the left\n\nHalf an angel per pin at best\n\nAdd wings, add heart, add harp, all set\n\n\n\nWe lean to turn in the velodrome\n\nAll lines are curved in the velodrome\n\nWe pitch and roll, wheels flesh and bones\n\nTotal control and it's\n\nIt's ours alone\n\n[x2]\n\n\n\nIt goes gospel, gossip, slander\n\nHarvest, hunger, rain dance\n\nHand-to-god, I didn't think it was contagious\n\nEve leaving Eden in a makeshift dress\n\nWith a bell to tell us when we're hungry\n\nThere's a bell to tell us when we're tired\n\nA bell that tells us to rise and fight\n\nA bell to rise and die\n\nIt's just all bells\n\nSometimes I ring myself\n\nTo see if I might chime\n\n\n\nWe lean to turn in the velodrome\n\nAll lines are curved in the velodrome\n\nWe pitch and roll, wheels flesh and bones\n\nTotal control and it's\n\nIt's ours alone\n\n[x2]\n\n\n\nWe spend our days and nights deciding\n\nWhere to go and how to ride there\n\nAnd in the end again\n\nWe all vote yes\n\nWe all turn left\n\n\n\nWe lean to turn in the velodrome",
