  "lyrics": "I see the morning breaking, painting colors in the sky\r\nFor a moment I am taking by the minutes passing by\r\nBefore the world comes calling I hold tight to the life\r\nThat I chose\r\nThere's faces I remember, places I forget\n\nEvery highway town looks the same the further out I get\n\nLighthouse in the rear view fades\n\nWith coming of the storm\n\n\n\nBut north, south, east, west\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nI carry my lady, my love\n\nMy compass rose\n\n\n\nShe's a dancer, she's a lover, she's a never ending smile\n\nGot thorns to make you bleed and leave you crying like a child\n\nShe's the guiding white line and the dead end sign\n\nIn the road\n\n\n\nBut north, south, east, west\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nI carry my lady, my love\n\nMy compass rose\n\n\n\nThere's love songs on the radio and peddles in the breeze\n\nThere's traces of her perfume in every breath I breathe\n\nNo matter far and wide, she is by my side\n\nCalling out to me\n\n\n\nAnd north, south, east, west\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nAn arrow buried deep inside\n\nMy weathered weary soul\n\nBoth hands on the steering wheel\n\nShe's bringing me back home\n\nI carry my lady, my love\n\nI carry my lady, my love\n\nMy compass rose",
