  "lyrics": "I got the good side of things\r\nLeft you with both of the rings\r\nMy fingers danced\r\nAnd swayed in the breeze\r\nThe change in the wind took you down to your knees\n\nI got the good side of you\n\nSent it out into the blue\n\nThe people danced\n\nTo the sound of your heart\n\nThe world sang along to it falling apart\n\n\n\nBut I sympathise \n\nAnd I recognise \n\nAnd baby, I apologise\n\nThat I got the good side,\n\nThe good side of things\n\n\n\nI got the good side of life\n\nTravelled the universe twice\n\nSo many thoughts I wanted to share\n\nBut I din’t call because it wouldn’t be fare\n\n\n\nThen I got the good side of new\n\nFound arms to fall right into\n\nI know how it looked, it wasn’t the plan,\n\nAnd someday I hope that you’ll understand \n\n\n\nThat I sympathise \n\nAnd I recognise \n\nAnd baby, I apologise\n\nThat I got the good side,\n\nThe good side of things\n\n\n\nI’m sure we’ll meet in the spring\n\nAnd catch up on everything, \n\nI’ll say I’m proud of all that you’ve done, \n\nYou taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love \n\n\n\nBut I sympathise \n\nAnd I recognise \n\nAnd baby, I apologise\n\nThat I got the good side,\n\nThe good side of things",
