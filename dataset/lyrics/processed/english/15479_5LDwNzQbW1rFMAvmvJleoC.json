  "lyrics": "Step out of the doorway\r\nI wish I was a ghost\r\nI wish I could remember how it feels to feel close\r\nHold onto the handrail\r\nHold onto my head\r\nIf I make it to the corner I can make it to my bed\n\n\n\nWith you\n\nWell it’s better than being alone\n\nBeing with you\n\nWell it’s better than being alone\n\n\n\nSometimes when I feel alright, I ask you if you love me\n\nCan’t you lie?\n\nSometimes in the middle of the night, in the middle of a movie, in the middle of a dream\n\nI start to cry, cry, cry\n\n\n\nWith you\n\nI might as well just be alone\n\nBeing with you\n\nI might as well just be alone\n\n\n\nWould you tie me down?\n\nTie me down on my knees\n\nYou’re so heartless, it’s hard to believe\n\nWould you tie me down?\n\nTie me [?]\n\nYou’re so ruthless, you’re just what I need\n\n\n\nPulling out my records\n\nPulling out my hair\n\nPulling out my money, I’m just making sure it’s there\n\nWalking down Division, like walking in a dream\n\nI can’t remember my name\n\nI don’t remember where I’ve been\n\n\n\nWith you\n\nWell it’s better than being alone\n\nBeing with you\n\nSometimes I’d rather be alone\n\n\n\nWill I tie you down?\n\nTie you down on your knees?\n\nI’m so messed up, it’s hard to believe\n\nGot to go downtown, and never do [?]\n\nI’ll give you head, I’ll give you something to read\n\n\n\nSometimes when I feel alright, can’t you lie?\n\nAh, sometimes when I feel alright\n\nAh, sometimes when I feel alright\n\nIn the middle of the night\n\nOh, in the middle of the night\n\nOh, in the middle of the night\n\nOh, in the middle of the night",
