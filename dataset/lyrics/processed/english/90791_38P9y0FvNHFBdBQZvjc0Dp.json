  "lyrics": "She grew up in a Indiana town, \nHad a good lookin' mama who never was around. \nBut she grew up tall and she grew up right\r\nWith them Indiana boys on an Indiana night. \nWell she moved down here at the age of eighteen, \n\nShe blew the boys away; was more than they'd seen. \n\nI was introduced and we both started groovin' \n\nShe said, I dig you, baby, but I got to keep movin' - on. \n\nKeep movin' on \n\n\n\nLast dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. \n\nI feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. \n\n\n\nWell I don't know but I've been told, you never slow down, you never grow old. \n\nI'm tired of screwin' up, tired of goin' down, \n\nTired of myself, tired of this town, \n\nOh my, my, oh hell yes - Honey put on that party dress. \n\nBuy me a drink, sing me a song, \n\nTake me as I come . cause I can't stay long. \n\n\n\nLast dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. \n\nI feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. \n\n\n\nThere's pigeons down on Market Square, \n\nShe's standing in her underwear. \n\nLookin' down from a hotel room, \n\nNightfall will be coming soon. \n\nOh my, my, oh hell yes, you got to put on that party dress. \n\nIt was too cold to cry, when I woke up alone. \n\nI hit my last number, I walked to the road. \n\n\n\nLast dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain. \n\nI feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again. \n\n\n\n(Thanks to Luke for these lyrics)",
