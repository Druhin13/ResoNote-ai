  "lyrics": "I can picture you now, taking your makeup off\r\nYou come into my room and you kiss my lips\r\nBut this hotel life, I'm not used to it\r\nAnd you wear your heart flat on your sleeve\r\nBut it took you a while to open up to me\r\nI still love the way that you smile when you leave\n\n\n\nAnd I know you get scared, and I know you're able\n\nBut I think about you almost everyday, yeah\n\nAnd I promised you that I'll be back again\n\nJust can you remember? Just try to remember when we were\n\n\n\nDancing in hotel rooms\n\nIt was just me and you\n\nAnd we wouldn't sleep all night\n\nWith you sitting by my side\n\nAnd every moment we had stolen was a feeling\n\n'Cause it never mattered\n\nWhere we poured our hearts, we're falling in love\n\nYour heart is my home, and your heart is my home\n\nAnd your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go\n\n\n\nWhen I was feeling down, you always pick me up\n\nIt didn't matter what I was doing wrong 'cause\n\nI've lived my life without you for too long\n\n\n\nBut when I walked in the door and I saw your face\n\nWho I'm leaving at home, but my world had changed\n\nHow could I live my life since you been and gone?\n\nBut can you remember? Just try to remember when we were\n\n\n\nDancing in hotel rooms\n\nIt was just me and you\n\nAnd we wouldn't sleep all night\n\nWith you sitting by my side\n\nAnd every moment we had stolen was a feeling\n\n'Cause it never mattered\n\nWhere we poured our hearts, we're falling in love\n\nYour heart is my home, and your heart is my home\n\nAnd your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go\n\n\n\nBut any single moment you can change\n\n'Cause I've been gone so long and I can feel you slip away\n\nI'm getting closer and closer\n\nBut can you remember? Just try to remember when we were\n\n\n\nDancing in hotel rooms\n\nIt was just me and you\n\nAnd we wouldn't sleep all night\n\nWith you sitting by my side\n\nAnd every moment we had stolen was a feeling\n\n'Cause it never mattered\n\nWhere we poured our hearts, we're falling in love\n\nYour heart is my home, and your heart is my home\n\nAnd your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go\n\n'Cause your heart is my home, and your heart is my home\n\nAnd your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go\n\n'Cause your heart is my home, and your heart is my home\n\nAnd your heart is my home, and I'm not letting go",
