  "lyrics": "It starts inside my head\r\nLet it course into my bones\r\nI breathe recycled air just to feel like I’m not alone\r\nSo does it kill you now?\r\nCall it insincere\r\nYou took the worst way out\n\nAnd I’m still here\n\n\n\nIt’s too late\n\nIt’s too late\n\nThe ground's breaking under me\n\nI can’t breathe\n\nI’m underneath\n\nSo go ahead and wish me hell cause\n\nYou’re the one who dragged me there, yeah\n\nIt’s too late to save today\n\n\n\nI took the right one at the wrong time\n\nIt’s like a dry scrape that you know can never heal\n\nSo give me something I can feel, to feel\n\nSo let it kill me now\n\nI took the worst way out\n\n\n\nIt’s too late\n\nIt’s too late\n\nThe ground's breaking under me\n\nI can’t breathe\n\nI’m underneath\n\nSo go ahead and wish me hell cause\n\nYou’re the one who dragged me there, yeah\n\nIt’s too late to save today\n\n\n\nAnd I still feel her in my bones\n\nFeel her in my bones\n\nI’m not alone\n\n\n\nIt’s too late\n\nIt’s too late\n\nThe ground's breaking under me\n\nI can’t breathe\n\nI’m underneath\n\nSo go ahead and wish me hell cause\n\nYou’re the one who dragged me there, yeah\n\nIt’s too late to save today",
