  "lyrics": "Touch!\r\nI'll stand for nothing less\r\nOr never stand again\r\nThese are the limits when one's buried\r\nThis body's left the soul\n\n\n\nCould we have known?\n\nNever would I, helped to nail down\n\n\n\nCareful of drifting off\n\nNow losing taste and touch\n\nTurning a pale blue, leaning in to say\n\nThis body's left the soul\n\n\n\nThe brain needs oxygen\n\nCan't sneak around this bait\n\nHis catacomb has got me by the chin\n\nThis body's left the soul\n\n\n\nCould we have known?\n\nNever would I, helped to nail down\n\nWith nothing to gain\n\nHere's the clincher, this should be you\n\n\n\nNow saturate, now saturate\n\nNow saturate, now saturate and touch!\n\nNow saturate! Now saturate!\n\nNow saturate, the earth!\n\nNow saturate, now saturate\n\nNow saturate, the earth!!\n\n\n\nWell could we have known?\n\nNever would I, helped to nail down\n\n(I'll stand for nothing less)\n\nWith nothing to gain, here's the clincher\n\nThis should be you, made cold and crippled\n\n\n\nThis happened to be, never changing\n\nHolding inside (or never stand again)\n\nThe phobia viewed, made cold and crippled\n\nEnding it all\n\n\n\nNow saturate! Now saturate!\n\nNow saturate! Now saturate! The earth!\n\nNow saturate, now saturate\n\nNow saturate",
