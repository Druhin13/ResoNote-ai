  "lyrics": "On a night like tonight\r\nIt's easy to believe love really might be in the air\r\nThe temperature is perfect\r\nAnd I'm pretty sure Spring won't be going anywhere\r\nSo whaddya say we all go down to Providence Canyon?\n\nCarve our names in the side of a red clay wall?\n\nSomebody grab matches, I'll get the cooler\n\nWhy didn't we think of this sooner?\n\nThe night won't last forever, after all\n\n\n\nRoll the windows down, kick your feet up on the dash\n\nAnd ride away\n\nFour wheels and a rusty frame is all we got, but just the same\n\nIt'll get us there\n\n\n\nWhaddya say we all go down to Providence Canyon?\n\nCarve our names in the side of a red clay wall?\n\nI got the wheel, somebody play an old song\n\nThat reminds us we're still young\n\nThe night won't last forever, after all\n\n\n\nAfter all stars fall bright there\n\nI can't recall a more peaceful piece of ground\n\nAfter all, tomorrow is unclear\n\nAfter all these years\n\n\n\nWhaddya say we all go down to Providence Canyon?\n\nCarve our names in the side of a red clay wall?\n\nSomebody grab matches, I've got the cooler\n\nWhy didn't we think of this sooner?\n\nThe night won't last forever, after all\n\nOh the night won't last forever, after all\n\nOh the night can't last forever, after all",
