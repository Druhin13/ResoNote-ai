And so I pop pain pills until I feel better and I'm hustlin' now we got that phone bill\n\nAnd I got me a job but no it won't cut it, so I step on that work 'cause the dope will\n\nAll we know is Now and Laters and skyscrapers\n\nYeah it's concrete, where the kids at? Let me go speak to 'em\n\nBut if you've never seen any mountains or the stars\n\nHow you ever 'sposed to know that's the thing you should reach for?\n\n\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\n\n\nWe won't do what they tell us\n\nPill poppin' just to feel better\n\nTimes gettin' hard, we try keep our head up\n\nIf we die, we gon' live forever\n\nWe won't do what they tell us\n\nPill poppin' just to feel better\n\nTimes gettin' hard, we try keep our head up\n\nIf we die, we gon' live forever\n\n\n\nWe never die that's why my motto still alive\n\nLike Aaliyah's spirit I told you one and a million times\n\nThis is a dream, the one I used to fantasize\n\nSo I'm lookin' at me from Heaven, through my grandma's eyes\n\nAnd I know that she be proud, so you hear me screamin' loud\n\n\"I'm on a billboard just so you could see me now!\"\n\nIf she in the clouds, why pour my drink on the ground?\n\nSo I pour it up for you, you want Henn' or a crown?\n\nChi-Town ambulances don't come around\n\nWhen shorties' brains blown out, you want me to dumb it down?\n\nThat's why we get high roll trees and backwoods\n\nIt's hard to know you can when you raised off canned goods\n\nAll we know is U.S.D.A checks and Save-A-Lot\n\nNever had money so we had to save alot\n\nSo how you gonna tell the kids, they capable to rewrite pop culture when all they had was pills to pop?\n\n\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever\n\nI wish I could live forever",
