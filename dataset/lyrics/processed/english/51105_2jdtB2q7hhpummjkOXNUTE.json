  "lyrics": "You need to get a job you need to go back to school\r\nThis isn’t proper all you do is act a fool\r\nLook at Tim, don’t you remember he was your friend\r\nHe’s a lawyer you could have been just like him\r\nI’m a give him a call now, tell me how does that sound\r\nAnd turn that crap down please you are such a child\n\nIt’s not music it’s foul and it’s way too loud\n\nYou really need to settle down and make grandma proud\n\nFirst of all grandma likes my shit so go ahead and call Tim, no I insist\n\nAnd ask him about the job that he loves so much\n\nAnd how he would give it all up just to rock with us\n\nThe way I see it I would rather rock this place\n\nCause I can rise out of misery and shock the state\n\nI could literally change lives with the vibes I make\n\nOr I could give it up and rot at a job I hate\n\nNow that sounds tempting but thanks I’ll pass\n\nIt’s not me and I’m sorry that it makes you mad\n\nBut when I’m old I would rather look back at the past knowing in my heart I gave it everything I had\n\nBigger and better things I’m not trying to be mean\n\nI got love for the music and love for the scene\n\nI respect your opinion but lately it seems\n\nI could either follow your rules or follow my dreams\n\n\n\nThe path to the future is hard to see\n\nDon’t stand still and let it pass you by by\n\nDon’t let it pass you by\n\n\n\nYou stay complacent, I hate the thought\n\nIt’s too basic so face it we’re taking off\n\nI look up to my elders, they paid the cost\n\nBut I’ll take what they say with a grain of salt\n\nI’ll be the first to confess to invest is smart\n\nSo I’ll invest my heart in my reckless art\n\nAnd gain acceptance from legends who set the bar\n\nThink not, better check my repertoire\n\nEnter into the mind of miracles intertwined\n\nWith wicked lyric artillery dropping at any time\n\nIt really be killing me when they chopping with iffy rhymes\n\nGet chopped up and screwed behind enemy lines\n\nI know the rappers can’t stand em\n\nThey try to stack up the antics\n\nAnd then they happen to panic\n\nYou cannot battle a cannon\n\nI’m sick and tired of this standing\n\nAbout to rattle the planet\n\nAnd ride off into the galaxy you probably can’t understand it\n\nBut I’m headed to the top and I know I’m gone shine\n\nComing down with a Hardy Boy Swanton Bomb\n\n\n\nThe path to the future is hard to see\n\nDon’t stand still and let it pass you by by\n\nDon’t let it pass you by\n\n\n\nThis world is cold, this we all know\n\nJust something you gotta deal with\n\nSome search far, high and low\n\nFor somebody to keep it real with\n\nSome grab a disc of their favorite mix\n\nAnd sit an reminisce and let their minds roam\n\nWhen the music hits you lose your shit\n\nCause that line made sense and it really hits home\n\nYour tears and the beat drop at the same time\n\nRacing for your heart until they reach the bass line\n\nThen you fall apart as they hit their mark\n\nLike straight to your chest point blank in the dark\n\nThese artist are marksman, we rarely miss\n\nWe hold on to the things you can barely grip\n\nA padded room and straight jacket that barely fits\n\nLike a walk in the park when compared to this\n\nWe amplify everything you feel inside\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you feel cause you feel alive\n\nKill the lies, don’t ever let them kill your pride\n\nKeep it up, have faith, keep real alive\n\nJust vibe to the music\n\nYou can’t hide from the music\n\nBut you can decide how to use it\n\nOr you can stand by just watch it die\n\nThen we can all sing bye bye miss American Pie\n\n\n\nThe future is here now\n\nNo time left for fear now\n\nThe future is here now\n\nIt’s time for us to stand out\n\n\n\nSometimes the future is frightening\n\nBut if you stand still life will break you down\n\nNow all my doubts are behind me\n\nNeed to get out and take it\n\n\n\nDon’t let it pass you by",
