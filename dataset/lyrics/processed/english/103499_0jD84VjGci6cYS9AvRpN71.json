  "lyrics": "I close my eyes and I pretend\r\nI slip away lying next to her\r\nAnd for a moment I will rest ashore\r\nI cross the mile, she seems so far\r\nBut in my mind I feel her beating heart\r\nAnd for a moment we are not apart\n\n\n\nAnd I feel that I'm lost inside the girl\n\nWhen I close my eyes almost to find the words\n\nLove revealed she's a diamond, she's a pearl\n\nShe's a ray of light, a shot heard around the world\n\nGod I'm lost inside the girl\n\n\n\nForbidden fruit it tastes so sweet\n\nWhat can I do to get her close to me?\n\nShe is the only cure for my disease\n\nInfatuation storms my heart\n\nIt's slowly breaking me, I fall apart\n\nWhat can I do? I always fall so hard\n\n\n\nAnd I feel that I'm lost inside the girl\n\nWhen I close my eyes almost to find the words\n\nLove revealed she's a diamond, she's a pearl\n\nShe's a ray of light, a shot heard around the world\n\nGod I'm lost inside the girl\n\n\n\nOh, I'm lost inside the girl\n\nI'm lost inside the girl\n\n\n\nShe can do no wrong\n\nStill she never seems to answer anymore\n\n\n\nHer [?] shines so bright\n\nBut my obsession is the darkest kind\n\nShe doesn't even know that I'm alive\n\n\n\nAnd I feel that I'm lost inside the girl\n\nWhen I close my eyes almost to find the words\n\nLove revealed she's a diamond, she's a pearl\n\nShe's a ray of light, a shot heard around the world\n\nGod I'm lost inside the girl\n\n\n\nI'm lost inside the girl\n\nI'm lost inside the girl\n\n\n\nShe can do no wrong\n\nStill she never seems to answer anymore\n\nShe can do no wrong\n\nStill she never seems to answer anymore",
