  "lyrics": "Now, there's a look that I know, a familiar feeling\r\nHer crush starts to grow, so she picks her massive meat\r\nAnd takes it all home, cook it for supper\r\nEats it alone, her crush starts to show\r\nHer crush starts to show, her crush starts to show\r\nHer crush starts to show\n\nShe hates how I'm always right, I know her emotions\n\nShe's got something to hide, but she don't like to talk\n\nOh, won't look me in the eyes when her crush starts to show\n\nThat's when I give her some time, give her some time\n\nHer crush starts to show, her crush starts to show\n\nHer crush starts to show\n\n\n\nOoh, babe! Hey, hey, babe\n\nMm, baby, baby, baby, hey, hey\n\nHer crush starts to show, her crush starts to show\n\nHer crush starts to show\n\n\n\nHate me now, love me then\n\nAll torn up by my new friend\n\nHate me now, it's more than friends\n\nHer crush shows, her crush shows\n\n\n\nOoh, babe! Her crush starts to show\n\nEy, ey, babe! Her crush starts to show\n\nHer crush starts to show, ey, ey, babe!\n\nHer crush starts to show",
