  "lyrics": "I disengaged and relinquished the rage\r\nRepressive memories combust into a sky of dust\r\nOversee my thoughts, bending time like light through the mist of night\r\nSlipping into serenity, speeding towards hearts that can’t break and steel traps of misdirection\r\nWeightlessness; separate from this conscious\n\nAlleviation from the noise\n\n\n\nLeave it all behind; a master of control\n\nI’d rather it be me than the others wielding the tightrope and chains of woe\n\nTake flight on the wings that aren’t impeded by conflict of trust; gusts powered by passion and retrospective intent\n\nBelieve in the purity of your escape\n\n\n\nWeightlessness; separate from this conscious\n\nAlleviation from the noise\n\nWeightlessness; separate from this conscious\n\nBreaking the rhythm of the noise\n\n\n\nPlease give me space to breath unblemished atmosphere\n\nWatch me float along this celestial breeze\n\nGive me hope to become one with everything (everything), to understand change as a necessity\n\n\n\nWeightlessness; separate from this conscious\n\nAlleviation from the noise\n\nWeightlessness; separate from this conscious\n\nBreaking the rhythm of the noise",
