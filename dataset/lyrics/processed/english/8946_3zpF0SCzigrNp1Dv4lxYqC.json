  "lyrics": "Just beyond the circle of light\r\n(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)\r\nWhat's in the gloom\r\nIn the thorns and the briar?\r\n(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)\n\nThere's no mistaking the wolf for the wind\n\nHe's been here before\n\nAnd he'll be here again\n\n\n\nIn my dream I ground my jaw\n\n(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)\n\nI'll be the good man outside the law\n\n(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)\n\n\n\nThere's no mistaking the wolf for the wind\n\nHe's been here before\n\nAnd he'll be here again\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderneath this dome of red\n\n(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)\n\nWhite dog circling overhead\n\n(I'll keep the watch, I'll keep the watch fire)\n\n\n\nThere's no mistaking the wolf for the wind\n\nHe's been here before\n\nAnd he'll be here again\n\n\n\nThere's no mistaking the wolf for the wind\n\nHe's been here before\n\nAnd he'll be here again",
