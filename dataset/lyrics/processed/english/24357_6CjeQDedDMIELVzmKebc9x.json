  "lyrics": "Oh\r\nLove, did you ever walk like no one could walk\r\nAnd the trees they could walk\r\nAnd one little key just unpicked the lock\r\n'Cause love\n\n\n\nI rolled down the hills like a ball\n\nThe world, nothing at all\n\nAnd the wildest mountains seemed suddenly small\n\n'Cause love\n\n\n\nDid it ever feel like you fell from the sky\n\nAnd no one asked, why?\n\nAnd everything moved like a young butterfly\n\n'Cause love\n\n\n\nIf you miss it, try again\n\nIt belongs to you, my friend\n\n\n\nLove, I don't think it begins or it ends\n\nThe lovers, the friends\n\nAnd one thing for sure you can never pretend\n\nTo love\n\n\n\nIt goes places the mind cannot go\n\nOnly history knows\n\nThat nothing was made by a single red rose\n\n'Cause love\n\n\n\nRight between the invisible, the true, bang out of the blue\n\nAnd all the days were made by you\n\n'Cause love\n\n\n\nBut if you miss it, try again\n\nIt belongs to you, my friend\n\n\n\nLove, it's not the thing that they said it would be\n\nThe bending of the knee\n\nA thousand violins singing into the sea\n\n'Cause love\n\n\n\nWon't be found in the lines of the page\n\nThe screens, the stage\n\nAnd sometimes your heart cannot be saved\n\nBy love\n\n\n\nIt's just a word that came out of a mind\n\nThe blind, led the blind\n\nAnd I for one could never decide about love\n\n\n\nBut if you miss it, try again\n\nIt belongs to you, my friend\n\n\n\nOh, love\n\n\n\nIf you miss it, try again\n\nIt belongs to you, my friend\n\n\n\nOh, love\n\n\n\nIf you miss it, try again\n\nIt belongs to you, my friend",
