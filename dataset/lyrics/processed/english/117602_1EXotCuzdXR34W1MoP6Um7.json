  "lyrics": "I've been there all alone\r\nWondering where you have been\r\nTen past three\r\nI know the club closes at two A.M\r\nI've already been through all those sad scenarios\r\nAnd it doesn't change your mind\n\nKnow it very well that you told me\n\nYou'd come home\n\nAnd it happened every time\n\n\n\nWish I had no expectations\n\nI wish that I could get into your head\n\nWith no confrontation\n\nReally wish we could talk about it instead\n\nAll these tears that I've cried while I'm turned to the side\n\nAnd you're in the same fucking bed\n\nWish I had no expectations\n\nBut I expect, you expect, we expect\n\n\n\nI don't need to ply\n\nI don't need no play by pay\n\nAll I need from your side\n\nIs for you to communicate\n\nOh, respect for my time, respect for my space\n\nRespect for my energy\n\n'Cause I've been waiting here all night for you to want me\n\nAnd you, have you [?] of me\n\n\n\nI wish I had no expectations\n\nI really wish I could break through your head\n\nWith no confrontation\n\nReally wish we could talk about it instead\n\nAll these tears that I've cried while I'm turned to the side\n\nAnd you're in the same fucking bed\n\nWish I had no expectations\n\nBut I expect, you expect, we expect\n\n\n\n\n\nI wish I had no expectations\n\nI really wish I could break through your head\n\nWith no confrontation\n\nReally wish we could talk about it instead\n\nAll these tears that I've cried while I'm turned to the side\n\nAnd you're in the same fucking bed\n\nWish I had no expectations\n\nBut I expect, you expect, we expect",
