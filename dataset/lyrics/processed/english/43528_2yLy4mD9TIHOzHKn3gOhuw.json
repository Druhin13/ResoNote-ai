  "lyrics": "Beauty queen of only eighteen \nShe had some trouble with herself \nHe was always there to help her \nShe always belonged to someone else \nI drove for miles and miles \n\nAnd wound up at your door \n\nI've had you so many times but somehow \n\nI want more \n\n\n\nI don't mind spending everyday \n\nOut on your corner in the pouring rain \n\nLook for the girl with the broken smile \n\nAsk her if she wants to stay awhile \n\nAnd she will be loved \n\nAnd she will be loved \n\n\n\nTap on my window knock on my door \n\nI want to make you feel beautiful \n\nI know I tend to get so insecure \n\nIt doesn't matter anymore \n\n\n\nIt's not always rainbows and butterflies \n\nIt's compromise that moves us along \n\nMy heart is full and my door's always open \n\nYou can come anytime you want \n\n\n\nI don't mind spending everyday \n\nOut on your corner in the pouring rain \n\nLook for the girl with the broken smile \n\nAsk her if she wants to stay awhile \n\nAnd she will be loved \n\nAnd she will be loved \n\nAnd she will be loved\n\nAnd she will be loved\n\n\n\nI know where you hide \n\nAlone in your car \n\nKnow all of the things that make you who you are \n\nI know that goodbye means nothing at all \n\nComes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls\n\n\n\nTap on my window knock on my door \n\nI want to make you feel beautiful\n\n\n\nI don't mind spending everyday \n\nOut on your corner in the pouring rain \n\nLook for the girl with the broken smile \n\nAsk her if she wants to stay awhile \n\nAnd she will be loved \n\nAnd she will be loved \n\nAnd she will be loved\n\nAnd she will be loved\n\n\n\nI don't mind spending everyday \n\nOut on your corner in the pouring rain...",
