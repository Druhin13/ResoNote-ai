  "lyrics": "Do you ever sit? In silence all alone?\r\nDrowned out by your thoughts?\r\nTryna get a grip, but just keep on spiralling down\r\nVoices getting loud\r\nFeeling something now\r\nOnly you know where to will\n\nDo you ever sleep? With troubles in your head?\n\nWrapped up in regrets?\n\nReaching for the help you gotta find inside yourself\n\nYou're stuck inside a spell\n\nDon't need nobody else body-else\n\n\n\nSo don't you mind\n\nI'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nBaby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)\n\nYeah, maybe I'm just comfortable\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nBaby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)\n\n\n\nI need to get away from inside of my brain\n\nI feel some type of way\n\nI'm dancing all alone, surrounded by everyone else\n\nI do it to myself\n\nNot asking for your help, for your help\n\n\n\nSo don't you mind\n\nI'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nBaby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)\n\nYeah, maybe I'm just comfortable\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nBaby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)\n\n\n\nSo don't you mind\n\nI'm doing just fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fine\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nBaby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)\n\nYeah, maybe I'm just comfortable\n\nMaybe I'm just comfortable\n\nBaby, maybe I-I-I'm just comfortable being sad (oh woah)",
