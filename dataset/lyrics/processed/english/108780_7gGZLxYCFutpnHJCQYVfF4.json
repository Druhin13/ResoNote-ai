  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Daylight par Blue October\r\nEverybody has a secret\nReal pain that they all conceal\nMaybe mine is contagious\nWith time it can make you feel\nLike a fake, like a failure\nAll I wanted was a brand new start\nI never needed to remember\nWhen the truth can break your heart\n\nOoh now I got it all out\nIt's all on the floor\n\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nYeah, break the river\nCome party\n\nBreak the river in the daylight\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nYeah, break the river\nCome party\nBreak the river\nBefore the daylight gets away from me\n\nI wear a mask in the spotlight\nBackstage there's a room so dark\nI'm not even going in there\nI'm afraid it would tear us apart\nThere's a sun when the dawn breaks\nThere's a light that will lead you home\nWhen the truth is contagious\nThis is all we need to know\n\nOoh now I got it all out\n\nIt's all on the floor\n\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nYeah, break the river\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nYeah, break the river\nCome party\nBreak the river\nBefore the daylight gets away from me\n\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nYeah, break the river\nCome party\n\nBreak the river in the daylight, in the daylight\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nYeah, break the river\nCome party\nBreak the river in the daylight\nBefore the daylight gets away from me",
