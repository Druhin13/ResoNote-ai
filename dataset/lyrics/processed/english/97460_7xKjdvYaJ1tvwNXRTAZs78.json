  "lyrics": "Now tell me something\r\nIs there a point to this?\r\nOr are we living for the feeling when we look back on what we did and reminisce?\r\n'Cause I’ve looked within and I've read\r\nBut instead I keep focusing\n\nOn just how thin I can get\n\nNow I'm looking for something else\n\nI found myself; I’m someone else\n\n\n\nI keep looking for something\n\nEven though I know that it's not there\n\n(Maybe you're the reason)\n\nEvery time I try to figure it out\n\nYou're the only thing I can think about\n\n(Maybe you're the reason)\n\n\n\nAnd I think I'm dying\n\nCause this can't be living\n\nShould I be searching for\n\nSome kind of meaning?\n\nApathy's a funny feeling\n\n\n\nI turned my gaze to the ceiling\n\nThanked a God I don’t believe in for the scene outside\n\nI tried my best at sleeping but my dreams were unappealing\n\nSo I searched for people in the landscape, passers by\n\n\n\nI keep looking for something\n\nEven though I know that it’s not there\n\n(Maybe you're the reason)\n\nEvery time I try to figure it out\n\nYou’re the only thing I can think about\n\n(Maybe you're the reason)\n\n\n\n\n\nI keep looking for something\n\nEven though I know that it's not there\n\n(Maybe you're the reason)\n\nEvery time I try to figure it out\n\nYou’re the only thing I can think about\n\n(Maybe you're the reason)",
