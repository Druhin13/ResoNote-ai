  "lyrics": "Coming in this world fully naked\r\nFeeling brand new so I'm your baby\r\nNever felt this safe, in a foreign place\r\nI used to feel so hollow, shallow, vacant\r\nWhen you’re around your clothes and all these faces\r\nAll the things we made\n\nFinally erased\n\n\n\nSo bad it should be forbidden\n\nSo good, so deep, I feel it\n\n\n\nYour love is like a higher power\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I’m born again, again\n\nCause every time you love me harder\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again\n\n\n\nYour love is for the dead and I want danger\n\nFeeling so alive because I crave ya'\n\nPassion, pleasure, pain\n\nIt all feels the same\n\nHotter than the sun, who needs saving?\n\nGot me on my knees so come and pray with me\n\nFlooding like a rain\n\nFeel like forty days\n\n\n\nSo bad it should be forbidden\n\nSo good, so deep, I feel it\n\nI'm reborn\n\n\n\nYour love is like a higher power\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I’m born again, again\n\n’Cause every time you love me harder\n\nI'm born, I’m born, I'm born again, again\n\n\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I’m born, I'm born, I'm born again, again\n\nI'm born again, again\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again\n\nI'm born again, again\n\n\n\nNever, never leave\n\nI finally believe\n\nCause I call you my baby\n\n\n\nYour love is like a higher power\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again\n\n'Cause every time you love me harder\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I'm born again, again\n\n\n\nEvery time, every time that I call I feel awakened\n\nWhen you dive in the tides of the ocean I feel heaven\n\nIt's like the first time, first time when you loved me naked\n\nI'm born, I'm born, I'm born again again",
