  "lyrics": "In the name of liberty, we set off to the sea\r\nIn the name of glory, fighting to be free\r\nBut one mistake can set it all to rest\r\nNo one sees and no one wins the game of chance\r\nI need to know\n\n\n\nWill the sun rise when it's over\n\nWill the sun rise, will there be a sky\n\nWill the sun rise another day\n\n\n\nA simple answer, that all of us should see\n\nLet things be what they may be\n\nOpen your eyes, do you think that you're the best\n\nTry to see the light before the final test\n\n\n\nI need to know\n\n\n\nWill the sun rise when it's over\n\nWill the sun ride, will there be a sky\n\nWill the sun rise another day\n\n\n\nSomeone is watching, waiting to see\n\nIf there's a chance before the sun fades for eternity\n\n\n\nWill the sun rise when it's over\n\nWill the sun rise, will there be a sky\n\nWill the sun rise when it's over\n\nWill the sun rise another day\n\n\n\nWill the sun rise, I need to know\n\nWill the sun rise when it's over\n\nWill the sun rise, I need to know\n\nWill the sun rise, will there be a sky\n\n\n\nWill the sun rise\n\nWill the sun rise\n\nWhen it's over",
