  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lonely Road par Ella Vos\r\nIt's 2 AM, still toss and turning\nI guess some things never change\nFell apart in California\nTry and meet me in the middle of some day\n\nCoz I can't make it alone without you\nYou're the only way I know\nI can't make it alone without you\nCoz I'm lost on a lonely road\nI'm lost on a lonely road\n\nWaiting here, things looking up now\nStill hold your secrets so far away\nWon't keep knocking if you're not gonna let me in\nCan I ever know if its here to stay\n\n\nCoz I can't make it alone without you\nYou're the only way I know\nI can't make it alone without you\nCoz I'm lost on a lonely road\n\nAnd I can't make it alone without you\nI want nobody else to know\nI can't make it alone without you\nCoz I'm lost on a lonely road\nI'm lost on a lonely road",
