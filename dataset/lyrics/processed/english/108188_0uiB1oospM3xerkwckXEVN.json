  "lyrics": "Every night I'm lyin' in bed \nHoldin' you close in my dreams \nThinkin' about all the things that we said \nAnd comin' apart at the seams \nWe try to talk it over \nBut the words come out to rough \n\nI know you were tryin' \n\nto give me the best of your love \n\n\n\nBeautiful faces and loud, empty places \n\nLook at the way that we live \n\nWastin' our time on cheap talk and wine \n\nLeft us so little to give \n\nThat same old crowd \n\nWas like a cold dark cloud \n\nThat we could never rise above \n\nBut here in my heart I give you the best of my love \n\nOh sweet darlin' you get the best of my love, oh \n\nSweet darlin', you get the best of my love \n\n\n\nI'm goin' back in time \n\nAnd it's a sweet dream \n\nIt was a quiet night \n\nAnd I would be all right \n\nIf I could go on sleepin' \n\nBut every mornin' \n\nI wake up and worry \n\nWhat's gonna happen today \n\nYou see it your way \n\nAnd I see it mine \n\nBut we both see it slippin' away \n\n\n\nYou know we always had each other baby \n\nI guess that wasn't enough \n\nOh, but here in my heart \n\nI give you the best of my love \n\nOh, sweet darlin' \n\n\n\nYou get the best of my love \n\nOh, sweet darlin' \n\nYou get the best of my love \n\nEvery night and day, \n\nYou get the best of my love \n\nOh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love \n\nOh, sweet darlin' you get the best of my love.. \n\netc.. \n\n\n\nLead Vocal: Don Henley\n\nPedal Steel Guitar: Bernie Leadon",
