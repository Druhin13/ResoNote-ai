  "lyrics": "I’ve got a girl\r\nShe only puts out water\r\nIn the night, in the day and in the morning\r\nWakes me up\r\nI shake her to the bone to calm her down\r\nTo stop the mourning\n\n\n\nI’ve got a heart that only fills me up with cold blood\n\nI’ve got a brain that only fills me with confusion\n\nOh lord\n\n\n\nI’ve got some time\n\nI fill it up with lies that I repeat to myself to keep on going\n\nI’ve got a life\n\nMan it’s filled up with the sorrow of a thousand other men with sin’s atoning\n\n\n\nI’ve got a heart that only fills me up with cold blood\n\nI’ve got a brain that only fills me with illusions\n\nOh lord, my lord\n\nOh lord\n\n\n\nGo to bed\n\nI put the bottle down but still it calls me from down the hall And up the stairs\n\nIt says come on let’s go around and when I go it takes me all the way\n\n\n\nI’ve got a heart that only fills me up with cold blood\n\nI’ve got a brain that never gives me no solution\n\nOh lord\n\n\n\nI’ve got some cash\n\nI borrowed from a man that didn’t know he was lending\n\nI held him dear and I held that money near\n\nIt disappeared\n\nJust blew off in the wind\n\n\n\nI’ve got a heart that only fills me up with cold blood\n\nI’ve got a brain that only fills me with illusions\n\nOh lord, my lord\n\n\n\nNow my girl\n\nShe fills me up with water\n\nIn the night, in the day and in the morning\n\nShakes me up and wakes me to the bone\n\nIt’s not enough to stop the mourning\n\n\n\nI’ve got a heart that only pumps me up with cold blood\n\nI’ve got a brain that only fills me with confusion\n\nOh lord, my lord",
