Prez, are you lost?\"\r\nPainting my future, won't see a tin of gloss\n\nAll these supporters, none of them been to the Moss\n\nWe run things, none of us been to the boss (wow)\n\nPrez, where's the album? It's been a while\n\nLook at the crowd, goes back over a mile\n\nCame in over my head\n\nWhat, you want to live on street?\n\nWon't get an ounce of cred\n\n30 straps, nobody dead\n\n30 snaps, must be a fed\n\nHow you gonna be so sure?\n\n\"President, President, please put me on - I ain't ever been so poor\"\n\nAlright, I'll give you help\n\nSaid to my mum, \"I'll give you wealth\"\n\n\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\nI don't really know, maybe I'm gone\n\nAnd when I die, call me a don\n\nPrez, what you doing? Prez, what you on?\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\nI don't really know, maybe I'm gone\n\nAnd when I die, call me a don\n\nPrez, what you doing? Prez, what you on?\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\n\n\nCan't keep watching my flows\n\nCan't keep watching the pros\n\n\"Prez, where's the album? Nobody knows\"\n\nLived in basements and bungalows\n\nMight see a stranger, might see Kill Off Killy on close\n\nPlease mind your knees, might get one to the toes\n\nGo against I? Must have put one to the nose\n\nThem kind of wasteman antics, yes I oppose\n\nNone of these guys have ever had a life on road\n\nWeren't born with a silver, but I had a life of gold\n\nT on the circuit, nothing's devolved\n\nT on the movements, nothing's addressed\n\nI don't want to bring it home to your nest\n\n\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\nI don't really know, maybe I'm gone\n\nAnd when I die, call me a don\n\nPrez, what you doing? Prez, what you on?\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\nI don't really know, maybe I'm gone\n\nAnd when I die, call me a don\n\nPrez, what you doing? Prez, what you on?\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\n\n\nPrez, what you on?\n\nI don't really know, maybe I'm gone\n\nAnd when I die, call me a don\n\nPrez, what you doing?
