Britney (Nigga)\n\nUsed to wear my uncle's clothes to the parties\n\nI know these pants big as hell, but they Ed Hardys\n\nTay tapped me like, \"Get ready, bro, I'm finna snatch these Cartis\"\n\n(Bruh, we don't tip around this bitch)\n\nI think that's when all this shit got started\n\nNext day, we standin' outside the apartment\n\nOn Chicago, when some niggas rolled up in a Charger (Skrrt)\n\nLike, \"Come up off them glasses 'fore we start sparkin'\"\n\nAll I remember is gunshots and dogs barkin'\n\nBruh like, \"That's them 7 Mile niggas,\" so that's our target\n\nNext day we on 7 Mile and Ferguson with five .40s\n\nTell his mama her baby gettin' aborted\n\nNo statute of limitations, so I gotta end that story\n\nPut the gang on our shirts, you know what my mans claim\n\nTerrorizin' shit, from Northland to Fairlane\n\nGettin' all the hoes at the high school games\n\nBunch of young niggas with some frames that'll go insane\n\nThen that RICO Act came, that's when niggas changed\n\nMy day one niggas dead or stuck in that cage\n\nMy day ones that's out, they don't wanna change\n\nBut I got too much to lose, gotta go my way (I can't stay the same)\n\n'Cause I remember when them people ran in my crib\n\nPointin' them SIGs, crazy how we went from babies to men\n\nQ was 17 when they gave him his bid\n\nStraight to the Pen, he get out, he gon' have great-grandkids\n\nSend him money every month 'cause he ain't say what we did\n\nOnly thing he told 'em is we went from babies to men\n\nOur transition was crazy... from babies (Grew up too fast)\n\nWe went from babies to men\n\nNow I got my foot on niggas' necks and I ain't lettin' up\n\nFive M's tucked, if I ain't do shit else, I ran it up\n\nHo give me a bottle, what I'm gon' do with a cup?\n\nI put on for Detroit, I need me a free pair of Bucks\n\nBitch, we really run the city, go and ask about us\n\nNiggas gettin' found without their head about us\n\nI was 17, givin' niggas no passes\n\nUnc' taught me how to shoot, we used to call it po' class (Bow)",
