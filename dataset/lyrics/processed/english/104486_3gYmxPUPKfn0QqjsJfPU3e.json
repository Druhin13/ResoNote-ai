  "lyrics": "We go out when the dance is through\r\nTonight I'm celebrating but it means nothing without you\r\nI think I see someone I know\r\nI'm hiding in my drink, making friends with the window\r\nThis weather couldn't get much worse\r\nI'm having conversations with the lines I've already rehearsed to myself\n\n\n\nI carry two hearts\n\nYou never wanted me to hold you like I could\n\nThey carry me through\n\nAnd there's a choir getting started but I've burned that bridge for good\n\nI believe with my heart\n\n\n\nThis moment is a loaded gun\n\nThe wrong involuntary move and we've killed the fun\n\nThe funeral, it brings us back\n\nWe've been ready many years, all dressed in black\n\n\n\nIf you tell me that your life is done\n\nTomorrow in the morning you can wake up\n\nAnd you can help someone for yourself\n\n\n\nI carry two hearts\n\nYou never wanted me to hold you like I could\n\nThey carry me through\n\nAnd there's a choir getting started but I've burned that bridge for good\n\nI believe with my heart\n\n\n\nYou smile while the symphony plays and tell me music is your only escape\n\nWell I don't hear it anymore, what do we do now?\n\n\n\n(This love it speaks, tells a different story)\n\n\n\nI thought you were the end of the rainbow\n\nIt was such a long road\n\nI thought of you and kept pushing against everything\n\nNow tell me what's the point of taking punches\n\nIf you never get the chance to hit back\n\nWhat's the point of taking punches?\n\nWhat's the point of doing anything?\n\n\n\nI carry two hearts\n\nYou never wanted me to hold you like I could\n\nThey carry me through\n\nAnd there's a choir getting started but I've burned that bridge for good\n\nI believe with my heart\n\n\n\nYou smile while the symphony plays and tell me music is your only escape\n\nWell I don't hear it anymore, what do we do now?\n\n\n\n(This love it speaks, tells a different story)",
