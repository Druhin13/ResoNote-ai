  "lyrics": "And it's hard to write about being happy\r\n'Cause all that I get\r\nI find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject\r\nAnd there would be no grand choirs to sing\r\nNo chorus could come in\n\nAbout two people sitting doing nothing\n\nBut I must confess\n\nI did it all for myself\n\n\n\nI gathered you here\n\nTo hide from some vast unnameable fear\n\nBut the loneliness never left me\n\nI always took it with me\n\nBut I can put it down in the pleasure of your company\n\n\n\nAnd there will be no grand choirs to sing\n\nNo chorus will come in\n\nNo ballad will be written\n\nIt will be entirely forgotten\n\n\n\nAnd if tomorrow it's all over\n\nAt least we had it for a moment\n\nOh darling things seem so unstable\n\nBut for a moment we were able to be still\n\nOh ooh ooh oh\n\n\n\nAnd there will be no grand choirs to sing\n\nNo chorus will come in\n\nNo ballad will be written\n\nThis will be entirely forgotten\n\n\n\nDa da da da da\n\nDa da da da da\n\nDa da da\n\nLa da da da da\n\nLa da da da da\n\nLa da da da da\n\nLa da da da \n\nLa da da da da\n\nLa da da da da\n\nLa da da da",
