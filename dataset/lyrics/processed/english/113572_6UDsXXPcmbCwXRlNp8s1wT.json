  "lyrics": "The day that I met you I started dreaming\r\nNow I write them down if I remember in the morning time\r\nI don’t know that much about Kingston\r\nBut I like the sound it makes when it starts pouring rain\r\nI think that tonight I’ll leave my light on\r\n'Cause I get lonely when it’s out and I miss you right about now\n\n\n\nBaby tell me where you want to go\n\nBaby tell me what you want to know\n\nGive you everything I have and more\n\n\n\nHe said baby, that’s what he called me, I love you\n\nEvery single word you say makes me feel some type of way\n\nIt’s the thought of you that slightly scares me\n\nBut it takes my breath away, forget what I was gonna say\n\nThe day that I met you I started dreaming\n\nNow I write them down if I remember in the morning time\n\n\n\nBaby tell me where you want to go\n\nBaby tell me what you want to know\n\nGive you everything I have and more\n\n\n\nBaby tell me where you want to go\n\nBaby tell me what you want to know\n\nGive you everything I have and more\n\n\n\nBaby tell me where you want to go\n\nBaby tell me what you want to know\n\nGive you everything I have and more",
