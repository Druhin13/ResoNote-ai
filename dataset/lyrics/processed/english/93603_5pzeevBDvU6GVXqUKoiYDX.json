'Cause I got blurry eyes off Gorilla Glue\n\nIt's really you? Are you tellin' lies? Well, it's feelin' true\n\nDifficult 'cause right before the rise of the pinnacle\n\nGot rid of you right before the lies became considerable\n\nI wonder if that nigga knew that he was just a nigga too\n\nI wonder if there's been a few, but anywho...\n\n\n\nI don't even know you anymore, ayy\n\nThis feel different, something's missing\n\nEvery time you call, I hit ignore ('Nore)\n\nI won't listen, save the bitchin'\n\nOoh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore\n\n(I don't even know you anymore)\n\nOoo-ooo, I don't even know you anymore (Ah)\n\n\n\nThis feel different, something's missing\n\nI won't listen, save the bitchin'\n\nOoh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore\n\n(I don't even know you anymore)\n\nOoh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore\n\n\n\nI don't even know you anymore\n\nThis feel different\n\nEvery time you call I hit ignore ('Nore)\n\nI won't listen, save the bitchin'\n\nI don't even know you anymore\n\nNetsky, alright\n\nI don't even know you anymore\n\nOoh-ooh, I don't even know you anymore",
