  "lyrics": "After the questions\r\nPops handed me a little tea, sleep and a blessing, uh\r\nFeet keeping me warm\r\nTucked in the sheets with a mattress and bedding, uh\r\nLaughed at the answers he gave\r\nLike he was a pastor or something\n\nHe knew what I seeked\n\nNews of the week, I was weak, yeah\n\nBut now I'm strong you should test me\n\nThe worlds fucked up past fixing\n\nThe motor is old and the pistons are pissed they ain't pressing\n\nAnd me\n\nI've missed one too many chances to win I ain't losing the drive\n\nIʼm invested\n\nDespite all the answers I lack\n\nThere's a purpose I'm cursed, pursuit till I'm breathless\n\nYeah\n\nA van and a press kit, manager, bed and a breakfast, a band a set list\n\nI took a moment to breathe\n\nHead first I jumped in the sea\n\nWith wet clothes and dry jokes\n\nI spoke on to thee\n\nHeavy I sway with the breeze\n\nStumbling over my feet\n\nI took a walk\n\nSo in this argument now who's who and the point of It all is for nothing, shhh\n\nPlease keep quiet I've explained all the quirks I am true I am here you can love me\n\nBut\n\nFor the meantime the least you could do is know that our problems are nothing\n\nAnd\n\nYour nation is dangerous, the way that they blame other races for suffering\n\nThe earth still spins on itʼs axis - fuck man, that has to mean something",
