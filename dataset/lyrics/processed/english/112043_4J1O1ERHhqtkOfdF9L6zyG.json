  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Bored par Bea Miller\r\n(bI've never been the type[/b)\nWho needs someone to blow their mind\nTo climb my tower\nTo bring me flowers\nBut if you wanna wake me up\nWith some coffee in a cup\nAnd talk for hours\nI'd like the sound of that\n\nBut you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind\n'Cause our bodies are predictable\n\nI know I'm gonna call you on my phone\nKnow I'm gonna ask when you get home\nI already know what's next\nI end up in your bed\n\nThen you're gonna put back on your clothes\nAnd I'm gonna wish I was alone\nBut we never change a step\nThen do it all again\nI'm bored\n\nI just want some company\nWhen I'm not between your sheets\nBut I'm not dramatic\nSo I pick my battles, yeah\nNo, I'm not saying we don't do it good\nDon't think I'd trade it if I could\nIt don't matter, though\nIt don't matter, no\n\nBut you don't satisfy the hunger in my mind\n'Cause our bodies are predictable\n\n\nI know I'm gonna call you on my phone\nKnow I'm gonna ask when you get home\nI already know what's next\nI end up in your bed\nThen you're gonna put back on your clothes\nAnd I'm gonna wish I was alone\nBut we never change a step\nThen do it all again\nI'm bored\n\nNo, I'm not saying we don't do it good\n(Not saying, not saying, not saying)\nDon't think I'd trade it if I could\n(Not saying, not saying, not saying)\nNot saying we don't do it good\n(Not saying, not saying, not saying)\nDon't think I'd trade it if I could\nIt don't matter, no\n\n\nI know I'm gonna call you on my phone\nKnow I'm gonna ask when you get home\nI already know what's next\nI end up in your bed\nThen you're gonna put back on your clothes\nAnd I'm gonna wish I was alone\nBut we never change a step\nThen do it all again\nI'm bored\n\nYou don't satisfy the hunger in my mind\n'Cause our bodies are predictable\nI'm bored\nYou don't satisfy the hunger in my mind\n'Cause our bodies are predictable\nI'm bored",
