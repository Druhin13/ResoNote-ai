  "lyrics": "I was out here playin' devilish games\r\nSo it's only right I ended up set up in flames\r\nI'm a grown man so I'll never complain\r\nI'm addicted to pain and bein' left in the rain\r\nI just sit and think about what I never became\r\nI pray everyday that I'm ready to change\n\nThey say once it's bad that it's never the same\n\nIt's like my car broke down on memory lane\n\nI can't wait 'til I face all the critics\n\nThat ain't never had to face the decisions that I had\n\nTo know if they had made the same ones shut the fuck up\n\nYou don't get paid to hate for a livin'\n\nIt's so easy to point your finger and judge\n\nHop in the pig pen and get to swingin' the mud\n\nEverything that we was, everything we've become\n\nEvery war that we won, everything that I've done\n\nHa, Lord can you hear my prayer\n\nIt's somethin' 'bout the city I can feel I swear\n\nI'm on my way God 'cause you're really there\n\nAlabama to Mississippi, now I'm almost there\n\nBefore I felt your presence I was almost scared\n\nA trade with the Devil I was almost shared\n\nNow I'm headed to the delta where no one cares\n\nWhere our souls are buried and loneliness is shared\n\n\n\nIn the darkness where the heartless and demons scream\n\nBeen tryin' to come clean, but it ain't what it seems\n\nI found a nightmare in my dreams, down in New Orleans\n\nThe darkness where the heartless and demons scream\n\nBeen tryin' to come clean, but it ain't what it seems\n\nI found a nightmare in my dreams, down in New Orleans\n\n\n\nHeard a rumor they was comin' for me\n\nSaw a glimpse into the future I was smilin' countin' blood money\n\nWalkin' down the dark alley street lights flickerin'\n\nEverything around me seemed so different\n\nFigurin' I must be lost, bad feelin' in my gut I gotta dust it off\n\nI got a chip on my shoulder better brush it off\n\nI keep reachin' for the gun havin' crazy thoughts\n\nI heard a mother cryin' tears fallen from her old eyes\n\nPedal drops as a rose dies, see it clear with closed eyes\n\nGunshot then the crow flies, night fall and the smoke rise\n\nCouldn't see the beauty inside all of the darkness\n\nVengeance and love I get confused with being heartless\n\nHeartless cross me out for a couple dollars\n\nRunnin' with the Devil and wonder what trouble follows\n\nStandin' in the street, surrounded by my past\n\nEvery sin I ever committed, is takin' me at last\n\nSaw karma's face in a black hoodie\n\nWith some gold teeth, and heard the police\n\nHeard a loud scream, seen the barrel flash\n\nFelt the sharp pain and now I can't breath\n\nWoke up from a dream in New Orleans\n\nPut my hands up as the choir sings\n\n\n\nIn the darkness where the heartless and demons scream\n\nBeen tryin' to come clean, but it ain't what it seems\n\nI found a nightmare in my dreams, down in New Orleans\n\nThe darkness where the heartless and demons scream\n\nBeen tryin' to come clean, but it ain't what it seems\n\nI found a nightmare in my dreams, down in New Orleans\n\n\n\nIn the darkness where the heartless and demons scream\n\nBeen tryin' to come clean, but it ain't what it seems\n\nI found a nightmare in my dreams, down in New Orleans\n\nThe darkness where the heartless and demons scream\n\nBeen tryin' to come clean, but it ain't what it seems\n\nI found a nightmare in my dreams. down in New Orleans",
