  "lyrics": "They like to get you in a compromising position\r\nThey like to get you there and smile in your face\r\nThey think they're so cute when they got you in that condition\r\nWell I think it's a total disgrace\r\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\nI been doing it since I was a young kid\n\nI come out grinnin'\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\n\n\nSo I call up my preacher\n\nI say, \"Give me strength for Round 5.\"\n\nHe said , \"You don't need no strength, you need to grow up son.\"\n\nI said, \"Growing up leads to growing old and then to dying\n\n\"And dying to me don't sound like all that much fun.\"\n\n\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\nI been doing it since I was a young kid\n\nI come out grinnin'\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\n\n\nOh no oh no\n\nI fight authority Authority always wins\n\n\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins\n\nI been doing it since I was a young kid\n\nI come out grinnin'\n\nI fight authority, Authority always wins",
