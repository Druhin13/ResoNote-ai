  "lyrics": "(Lips)\r\nI'm feeling so nostalgic, nostalgic\r\nYour lips are something magic, magic\r\nI just wanna feel them one more time\n\nI heard you got a new man, new man\n\nGirl, why'd you go and do that, do that\n\nGive that boy a little kiss goodbye\n\n\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to feel those lips again\n\nFeel them on my skin again\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\nWhat I wouldn't do to hear them whispering\n\nGoosebumps on my skin again\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\n\n\n(Lips)\n\n\n\nI know I'm always busy, busy\n\nNon-stop city to city\n\nYou weren't ready for that high speed life\n\n\n\nBut it gets lonely on the tour bus, tour bus\n\nAnd there's room here for the two of us, two of us\n\nJust in case you ever change your mind\n\n\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to feel those lips again\n\nFeel them on my skin again\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\nWhat I wouldn't do to hear them whispering\n\nGoosebumps on my skin again\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\n\n\n(Lips)\n\n\n\nIt's 3 a.m\n\nScrolling through the photos that you sent back then\n\nReading all the messages, remembering\n\nAnd all I wanna do right now is call you\n\nBut I know that I can't call you\n\nGod, I wish that I could call you\n\n\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to feel those lips again\n\nFeel them on my skin again\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\nWhat I wouldn't do to hear them whispering\n\nGoosebumps on my skin again\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\n(Lips)\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?\n\n(Lips)\n\nWhy aren't you here with me now?",
