  "lyrics": "The winter\r\nDoesn't want you\r\nIt haunts you\r\nSummer serenadings\r\nA long way\r\nFrom this frozen place\n\nYour face\n\nOur teacher\n\nOur preacher\n\nIt's nature\n\nAnd like flowers growing in a bomb crater\n\nFrom nothing\n\nA rose\n\nIt grows\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about the West Coast\n\nNot the one that everyone knows\n\nI'm sick of living in the shadows\n\nWe've one more chance before the light goes\n\nFor a summer of love\n\nA summer of love\n\n\n\nWe're freezing\n\nWe're leaving\n\nBelieving\n\nThat all we need is to head over somewhere\n\nIn a summer\n\nTo come\n\nSo we run\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about the West Coast\n\nNot the one that everyone knows\n\nI'm sick of living in the shadows\n\nWe've one more chance before the light goes\n\nFor a summer of love\n\nA summer of love\n\n\n\nOh and when all is lost\n\nWhen all is lost we find out what remains\n\nOh the same oceans crossed\n\nThe sun's pleasure\n\nThe sun it's pink\n\n\n\nI've been thinking about the West Coast\n\nNot the one that everyone knows\n\nIn the rubble of Aleppo\n\nFlowers blooming in the shadows\n\nFor a summer of love\n\nA summer of love",
