  "lyrics": "Once upon a time, I still believed in myself\r\nI was happy being me and didn't need any help\r\nAnd then somebody that I trusted crushed the feelings I felt\r\nI guess a happy never after was the deal I was dealt\r\nTrue love doesn't have a happy ending\n\n'Cause when it's real, it doesn't ever end\n\nIf I did a rewrite, would I change a damn thing?\n\nWould I flip the script or would I do it all again?\n\n\n\nAm I the hero, or maybe the villain?\n\nAm I the sidekick, or even the fill-in?\n\nI'll keep going out for every roll\n\nIn a story that'll never be told\n\nIf I wrote you a note, would you ever listen?\n\nIf we never met, would you be who I'm missing?\n\nI'll keep writin' till I'm feelin' complete\n\nThe story that'll never be we\n\n\n\nI been havin' trouble with believin' in love\n\nEver since the day you left me, it depressed me and thus\n\nI haven't met somebody worth believin' in much\n\nI guess the movies I grew up on didn't teach me enough\n\nLearnin' to grow and go and sew my broken heart up\n\nDoesn't happen in an hour, just like Hollywood does\n\nThere's a problem and you solve it, that's the way they taunt us\n\nBut how am I s'posed to fix me, if I'm all that I've got?\n\n\n\nTrue love doesn't have a happy ending (No, it doesn't)\n\n'Cause when it's real, it doesn't ever end\n\nIf I did a rewrite, would I change a damn thing?\n\nWould I flip the script or would I do it all again?\n\n\n\nAm I the hero, or maybe the villain?\n\nAm I the sidekick, or even the fill-in?\n\nI'll keep going out for every roll\n\nIn a story that'll never grow old\n\nIf I wrote you a note, I hope that you'd listen\n\nAnd if we never met, you'd probably be who I'm missing\n\nI'll keep writin' till I'm feelin' complete\n\nThe story that'll never be we\n\nYeah, we'll never be we\n\n\n\nYeah, we'll never be we\n\n\n\nFuck",
