  "lyrics": "Brace yourself boy\r\nShe's dancing in your headlights\r\nDrifting\r\nTrying not to fall like\r\nPermanently into your arms\r\nOut of nowhere\n\nShe's leaning in your window\n\nSinging\n\nSongs out your soundtrack\n\nPlay it back\n\nPermanently into your heart\n\n\n\nI was in the back room\n\nDreamin' out loud before I found you\n\nI was stuck on that phone call\n\nTom Petty waiting on a free fall\n\n\n\nSometimes we brace\n\nAnd then fall\n\nSometimes we don't feel right\n\nSometimes we don't fall at all\n\n\n\nThank you, my love\n\nMy little war is over\n\nSometimes I don't think straight\n\nDrifting\n\nDrifting\n\nPermanently out of your arms\n\nThen out of nowhere\n\nYou're leaning in my window singing\n\nSongs out of my soundtrack\n\nPlay it back\n\nPermanently into my heart\n\n\n\nI was in the back room\n\nDreamin' out loud before I found you\n\nI was stuck on that phone call\n\nTom Pettyâ€¯waiting on a free fall\n\n\n\nSometimes we brace\n\nAnd then fall\n\nSometimes we don't feel right\n\nSometimes we don't fall at all\n\n\n\nI was brokenhearted\n\nFrom the ones who hurt to love\n\nBut when you're lionhearted\n\nYou let em fall, you let em fall back in your arms yea\n\n\n\nSometimes we brace\n\nAnd then fall\n\nSometimes we don't feel right\n\nSometimes we don't fall at all",
