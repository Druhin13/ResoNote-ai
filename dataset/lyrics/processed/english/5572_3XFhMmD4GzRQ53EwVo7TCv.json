  "lyrics": "Put me in this box like you always do\r\nLock it up\r\nStuck between the lines\r\nAnd the lines get finer\r\nMake me into something\n\nThat can be understood\n\nAnd play pretend good\n\nJust like you should\n\n\n\nAnd you're shuffling your feet\n\nFor a beat you can eat\n\nJust to taste it\n\nAnd remember that you never liked meat\n\n\n\nAnd now you're wasted\n\nSuddenly vacant\n\nApparently going always stopping for nothing\n\nYou'll never be good\n\n\n\nHow do you deserve the two\n\nDefine tastes like, define the being\n\nCruel so cruel\n\nIt's black and it's white\n\nAnd it's feeling good\n\nSo how did you find that being\n\n\n\nWell you put me in this box like always\n\nThrow the key\n\nEyes in disguise and the guise gets blurry\n\nMake me into something that can be understood\n\nAnd play pretend good\n\nJust like you should\n\n\n\nAnd you're shuffling your feet\n\nFor a beat you can eat\n\nJust to taste it\n\nAnd remember that you never knew me\n\n\n\nAnd now you're treating apparently\n\nThe faking was apparently\n\nA lesson that was given on day one\n\nAnd you'll never be good\n\n\n\nHow do you deserve the two?\n\nDefine tastes like, define the being\n\nCruel so cruel\n\nWho do you think you are\n\nWho are you?\n\nAnd how did you find that being?",
