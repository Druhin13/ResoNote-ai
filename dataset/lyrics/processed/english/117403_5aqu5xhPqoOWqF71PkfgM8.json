  "lyrics": "Girl, would it kill you just to show a little bit of attention?\r\nIf I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson\r\nNow would you hate me if I said goodbye\r\nSo quick you could eat my dust?\r\nNow would you hate me if I ran like hell\n\nIn the wind from dawn 'til dusk?\n\n\n\nWhen you cry, you waste your time\n\nOver boys you never liked\n\nCan you not be so obvious?\n\nSo keep it light\n\nSo keep it light, no\n\n\n\nI thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen\n\nI know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent\n\nI don't wanna die so young\n\nGot so much to do\n\nI don't smile for the camera\n\nOnly smile for you\n\nSmile for you\n\n\n\nNow would you hate me if I said goodbye\n\nSo quick you could eat my dust?\n\nNow would you hate me if I ran like hell\n\nIn the wind from dawn 'til dusk?\n\n\n\nWhen you cry, you waste your time\n\nOver boys you never liked\n\nCan you not?",
