  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Man in Black par Goody Grace\r\nWell, you wonder why I always dress in black\nWhy you never see bright colors on my back\nAnd why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone\nWell, there's a reason for the things that I have on\n\nI wear the black for those who've never read\nOr listened to the words that Jesus said\nAbout the road to happiness through love and charity\nWhy, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me\n\nWell, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose\nIn our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes\n\nBut just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back\nUp front there ought to be a man in black\n\nAnd I wear it for the thousands who have died\nBelieving that the Lord was on their side\nI wear it for another hundred thousands who have died\nBelieving that we all were on their side\n\nWell, there's things that never will be right I know\nAnd things need changing everywhere you go\nBut 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right\nYou'll never see me wear a suit of white\n\nAh, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day\n\nAnd tell the world that everything's okay\nBut I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back\nUntil things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black",
