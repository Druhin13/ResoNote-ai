  "lyrics": "Last night is sinking in\r\nIt's in my blood and on my skin\r\nI feel it ringing in my head\r\nColliding with my day\r\nWhen you let go of all your fear\n\nThe perfect life does not exist\n\n\n\nLast night is sinking in\n\nThis is the way I deal with things\n\nWhen I feel nature pressing in\n\nColliding with my day\n\n\n\nWhen you let go of all your fear\n\nThe perfect life does not exist\n\n\n\nThere is a quaking in the temple now\n\nI feel a shiver in the river now\n\nYou can escape but hey, I don't know how\n\nYou can escape but hey, I don't know how\n\n\n\nLast night has dragged itself back here\n\nColliding with my day\n\n\n\nWhen you let go of all your fear\n\nThe perfect life does not exist",
