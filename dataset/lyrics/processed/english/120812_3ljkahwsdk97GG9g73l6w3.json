  "lyrics": "No one knows the pain\r\nNo one sees what I see in you\r\nNo one feels the same\r\nNo one sees myself like you do\r\nWould it be easier if I stayed at home?\n\nWasting my time on my own\n\nAnd hoping that you'd come along\n\nAnd would you be honest, baby?\n\nIf I said the words \"Dou you love me?\" for a moment\n\nOr is this just wandering romance?\n\n\n\nTell me why you can't control\n\nThe feelings you desire\n\nBurning on my bridges\n\nAs you said my world's on fire\n\n\n\nSave me being honest, baby\n\nSave me from your promises\n\nTake me with your constant shame\n\nLet me bleed your love away\n\n\n\nSo take it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\nTake it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\nTake it how you got me now\n\nAfter breaking down my heart\n\nTake it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\n\n\nNo one knows the pain\n\nNobody is watching when you're gone\n\nNo one clears the stairs\n\nBut no one keeps me dirty like you do\n\n\n\nTell me why you can't control\n\nThe feelings you desire\n\nBurning on my bridges\n\nAs you said my world's on fire\n\n\n\nSave me being honest, baby\n\nSave me from your promises\n\nTake me with your constant shame\n\nLet me bleed your love away\n\n\n\nSo take it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\nTake it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\nTake it how you got me now\n\nAfter breaking down my heart\n\nTake it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\n\n\nBurning, yeah\n\nBurning on my bridges\n\nAs you said my world's on fire\n\nSave me being honest, baby\n\nSave me from your promises\n\nTake me with your constant shame\n\n\n\nSo take it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\nTake it how you want it\n\nTake all my love\n\nTake it how you got me now\n\nAfter breaking down my heart\n\nSo take it how you want it\n\nTake all my love",
