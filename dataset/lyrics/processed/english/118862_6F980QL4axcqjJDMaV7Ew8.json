  "lyrics": "When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity\r\nAlarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity\r\nA cure I know that soothes the soul does so impossibly\r\nA moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on\r\nMe and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody\r\nAll reason flown as God looks on in abject apathy\n\nA squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety\n\nA moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me\n\n\n\nWhen the meaning's gone\n\nThere is clarity\n\nAnd the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me\n\nAnd it's easy done\n\nOur little remedy\n\nAnd the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me\n\n\n\nWhat yields the need for those who lead us oh-so morally\n\nThose that would view the same we do through their deformity\n\nWho view the deed as power's creed as pure authority\n\nThis moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me\n\n\n\nSince it all begun\n\nTo its reckoning\n\nThere the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me\n\nBe thankful some know it lovingly\n\nThere the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me\n\n\n\nLike a heathen clung to the homily\n\nLet the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me\n\nSo summon on the pearl rosary\n\nLet the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me",
