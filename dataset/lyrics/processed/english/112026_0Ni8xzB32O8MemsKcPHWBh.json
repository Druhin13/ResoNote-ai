  "lyrics": "Do you really believe that you can never be sure?\r\nThey're leaving bodies in stairwells\r\nWashing up on the shore\r\nDo you really expect us to care what you're waiting for?\r\nWhen you're high in your castle, keeping an eye on the door\r\nThe door, the door\n\n\n\nIf I only see what I can see\n\nI know it isn't there\n\nAnd if only need what I can keep\n\nI know it isn't fair\n\n\n\nOh, baby\n\nYou can look away\n\nWhile they're dancing on our graves\n\nBut I will stop at nothing\n\nOh, I will stop at nothing\n\nAnd you can look away\n\nWhile they're dancing on our graves\n\nBut I will stop at nothing\n\nNo, I will stop at nothing now\n\n\n\nDo you really believe that you are one of a kind?\n\nIf you don't have a heart I can offer you mine\n\nDo you really expect that you will always be fine?\n\nWhen you're high on your throne\n\nAnd never toeing the line, the line, the line\n\n\n\nIf I only see what I can see\n\nI know it isn't there\n\nAnd if only need what I can keep\n\nI know it isn't fair\n\n\n\nOh, baby\n\nYou can look away\n\nWhile they're dancing on our graves\n\nBut I will stop at nothing\n\nOh, I will stop at nothing\n\nAnd you can look away\n\nWhile they're dancing on our graves\n\nBut I will stop at nothing\n\nNo, I will stop at nothing now\n\n\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nFrom all that we've done\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nFrom all that we've done\n\n\n\nOh, baby\n\nYou can look away\n\nWhile they're dancing on our graves\n\nBut I will stop at nothing\n\nOh, I will stop at nothing\n\nAnd you can look away\n\nWhile they're dancing on our graves\n\nBut I will stop at nothing\n\nNo, I will stop at nothing now\n\n\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nFrom all that we've done\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nFrom all that we've done\n\n\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nLookin' away, you're lookin' away\n\nFrom all that we've done",
