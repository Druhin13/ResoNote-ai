  "lyrics": "Is anyone listening or am I talking to myself\r\nI keep on repeating but it doesn't seem to help\r\nAnd maybe I've lost touch with everything I know\r\nI got a funny feeling we're both about to be alone\r\nMaybe I know something you don't want to admit\n\nSaying I'm just losing it\n\n\n\nEveryone knows it's time to back down\n\nDrop the act, no more sound\n\nI hate the show, I'm not buying it\n\nSo don't you dare come home\n\nDon't tell me it's alright without telling me where you were last night\n\nAnd everyone knows, so don't you dare come home\n\n\n\nIt's not hard to see it\n\nAnd every time I try to ask you tell me I'm dreaming\n\nBut no one sleeps enough for that\n\nOh baby it's alright, you can stay with someone else\n\nI got a funny feeling that you're laughing to yourself\n\n\n\nDid you think that I wouldn't find out\n\nYou've been running your mouth all over town\n\nBut the truth is I ain't losing any sleep over you and me",
