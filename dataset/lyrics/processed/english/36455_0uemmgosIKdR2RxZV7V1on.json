  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Out Like a Light par The Honeysticks\r\nTake me uptight\nStrung up like a kite\nDumb, wicked, and white\nLove me in spite\nIf I betrayed our lonely nights\nSpent out like a light\nWith no kiss goodnight\nWould we never fight when I'm away?\n\nDid your mother always seem to hate me?\nI'm sicker every day and now I'm terrified of talking to my friends only to stay stuck\nDreaming of our first born and your hair covered in popcorn\nYou never leave, you never leave, you never leave\n\n\nYou leave me uptight\nStrung up like a kite\nDumb, wicked, and white\nLove me in spite\nIf I betrayed our lonely nights\nSpent out like a light\nWith no kiss goodnight\nWould we never fight when I'm away?",
