  "lyrics": "When we run both our feet are off the ground\r\nIf you were to slow it down, we would be falling\r\nEveryone choses how to have their fun\r\nWait a while before you jump into the night and\r\nSlip away\n\nAnd if we take a minute\n\nWe can get our stories straight\n\nOn and on in motion, moving\n\nJust to slip away\n\n\n\nCarry on\n\nIt's gets darkest before dawn\n\nWait a while\n\nIt won't be long until the morning\n\n\n\nAnd if we take a minute\n\nWe can get our stories straight\n\nOn and on in motion, moving\n\nJust to slip away\n\n\n\nAnd if we take a minute\n\nWe can get our stories straight\n\nOn and on in motion, moving\n\nJust to slip away\n\n\n\nSlip away\n\nSlip away\n\nSlip away\n\n\n\nAnd if we take a minute\n\nWe can get our stories straight\n\nOn and on in motion, moving\n\nJust to slip away\n\n\n\nAnd if we take a minute\n\nWe can get our stories straight\n\nOn and on in motion, moving\n\nJust to slip away",
