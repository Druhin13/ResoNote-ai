  "lyrics": "[Chorus: x2]\r\nLess one, just might lose breath\r\nRead me, my right's I've left\r\nLess one, just might lose breath\r\n[Verse 1:]\n\nA routine stop, that's what he called it\n\nRegistration, glovebox, license, wallet\n\nThere's blood on the drivers face and neck\n\nSo his police senses suspects it's a domestic\n\nThe girl looked like she took one to the eye\n\nWith his hand on the gun he says 'drop the keys outside'\n\nNaturally the gentlemen asked them 'Why? '\n\nNow the gun's coming out the holster, that's his reply\n\nPassenger seat starts to scream\n\nLike she ain't ever seen the same thing on the TV screen\n\n'Mam - shut your motherfucking mouth\n\nAnd sir - may I suggest that you unbuckle and get out'\n\nDoor opens, left leg touched down\n\nWithin a split second upper torso was on the ground\n\nLike god damn, you could've snapped his spine\n\nPigs knee to the back, hog-tied by the swine\n\nGirlfriend's tryna hold back tears\n\nAnd the driver's on the concrete yelling and swearing\n\nOfficer got a little bit lost in the zone\n\nIt all took him back to childhood, home sweet home\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n\n\n[Verse 2:]\n\nDoesn't understand the reasoning for being lenient\n\nAnd won't give you the chance for anything but obediance\n\nHe got that from his drunk old man\n\nHeavy-fisted bag of piss used to throw those hands\n\nThat's why he never goes easy on kids\n\nHe's got his own kids now, he knows exactly how it is\n\nNow last week he caught his son smoking speed\n\nSo if you meet you might catch a couple broken teeth\n\nSometimes it can get so intense\n\nProfiling the type that likes to put dick up in his princess\n\nIt used to be hippy's, then it was black dudes\n\nNow she only fools around with loosers, with tattoos\n\nWell fuck em all, get on the ground dirt ball\n\nAnd sing hymns for the sins that protect and serve ya'll\n\nPeace disturbed, eat that curve\n\nOr you're looking down the barrel of steel made of nerves\n\nPuts his life into his work and work back into life\n\nSo wife thinks he's a jerk\n\nAin't no tellin what them boots might do\n\nIf she leaves him for someone that looks like you\n\n\n\n[Chorus]",
