I’m bringing a literal flame thrower\n\nI got a stinger missile in range of ya Range Rover\n\nBack in the day ya tape would get tossed or taped over\n\nWon’t go on Flex, he can’t handle me flowing\n\nFuck a Bomb, get the sound of a planet explodin'\n\nThe sound of a space shuttle when it land in the ocean\n\nOr the sound of a war vet who can’t handle emotions\n\nRockin' back and forth with the hammer reloadin'\n\nThe sound of the hammer of Odin or a sample from The Omen\n\nGet a scream from ya worst bad dream...\n\nAnd I’ll put it in a verse or get a cut from Preem\n\nThere’s no where to run to\n\nI don’t care if you got a gun or you can do kung fu\n\nWhen Ap is on the mic and start doin his \"one-two\"\n\nThe silencers screw on and light bulbs unscrew...\n\n\n\nDemigodz\n\nThe order is manslaughter\n\nAp is back\n\nCome on Ap... what you waitin for?\n\nTake a deep breath... because ya don’t have another left\n\nCome on Ap... what you waitin for?\n\n\n\nI’m a rap outcast like Big Boi’s group\n\n(Futuristic) Do features for Bitcoin loot\n\nPull the pistol out ya palm like this toys cute\n\nDissemble it, melt the metal and destroy you\n\nI got bouncers at the club that’ll let me in with burners\n\nAnd priests in my hood who won’t let me in they churches\n\nEven though I’m God and they gon' sweat me in they service\n\nSo i just air em out, real petty in my verses\n\nI never ever sleep like Freddy’s in my furnace\n\nThese underground clowns tryna get me in they circus\n\nBut I’m deep with the subs... and I ain’t ready to surface\n\nFuck somebody ever tryna tell me what my worth is\n\nThe weight of these words is bout as heavy as the Earth is\n\nAlways roll deep and stay ready for the skirmish\n\n'Cause people plottin' on me like Many Men to Curtis\n\nSo i purchase many weapons, even get me 'em refurbished\n\nI’m goin' off the grid, I’m already in the sewers\n\nAbout to fake my death like Eddie and the cruisers\n\nDress sophisticated, so I’m sexier to cougars\n\nBut I'm deadly when intruders try to test me with the Rugers\n\nI move like a ninja do, especially in Pumas\n\nSittin' next to Jesus, starin' skeptically at Judas\n\nMy enemies are foolish, never catch me with them losers\n\nI’ll be waitin' for 'em with machetes and bazookas\n\nLet 'em know Preem\n\n\n\nDemigodz\n\nThe order is manslaughter\n\nAp is back\n\nCome on Ap... what you waitin for?\n\nTake a deep breath... because ya don’t have another left\n\nCome on Ap... what you waitin for?\n\nAp is back, Ap is back, Ap is back\n\nCome on Ap... what you waitin for?",
