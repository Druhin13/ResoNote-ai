What are you doing?)\n\nIs it just another dumb love song?\n\n(What are you doing? What are you doing?)\n\n(On and on and on)\n\n\n\n(Is it just, is it just)\n\nIs it just another dumb love song?\n\n(Is it just, is it just another dumb love song?)\n\n\n\nYeah, I hope you're doing fine\n\nI think of you from time to time\n\n\n\nDoes it make you feel alive?\n\nDoes it make you wanna cry?\n\nDoes it mend and break your heart like it did when you broke mine?\n\nDo you ever think of me?\n\nWill you ever listen it?\n\nOn and on and on and on\n\nOr is it just another dumb love song?\n\n\n\n(What are you doing? What are you doing?)\n\nIs it just another dumb love song?\n\n(What are you doing? What are you doing?)\n\n(On and on and on)\n\n\n\n(Is it just, is it just)\n\nIs it just another dumb love song?\n\n(Is it just, is it just another dumb love song?)\n\n\n\nWhat are you doing? What are you doing?\n\nWhat are you doing? What are you doing?",
