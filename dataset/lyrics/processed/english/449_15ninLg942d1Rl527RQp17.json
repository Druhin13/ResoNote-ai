  "lyrics": "[Verse:]\r\nHe gave his baby boy a bath\r\nTub full of bubbles and toys for him to splash\r\nLook at daddy, soapsuds moustache\r\nFunny faces and voices, it makes the baby belly laugh\r\nDry him off, now you squeaky clean\n\nAnd watch the water spiral down that drain\n\nWrap him in a towel so he doesn't get the shivers\n\nBrush his hair, it seems to help it dry it quicker\n\nLaid him on mommy and daddy's bed now that he's dry\n\nAnd put a diaper on him, gave him his pacifier\n\nSuperman pyjamas, so tough\n\nInnocent face full of unconditional love\n\nDaddy picked him and rocked him slow\n\nNever takes long for little guy's eyes to close\n\nDad's technique is different than your mother's\n\nNever learned any lullabies, he sings Stevie Wonder's\n\nThere it is, steady breathing, sleep rhythm\n\nDaddy sits and holds him just to listen for a minute\n\nDaddy's hands are the meaning of security\n\nAnd baby's hands are the evidence of purity\n\nThinking back to the day baby came\n\nAnd how it changed the whole game, things ain't the same\n\nDaddy had to stop running it crazy\n\nKeep his ass in the home with the son and his lady\n\nHe was there for the birth and the first breath\n\nNot gonna miss the first words or the first steps\n\nGonna keep the boy healthy and safe\n\nAnd do his best to try to keep those tears off his face\n\nGave him a kiss, laid him in his crib\n\nTurned out the lights, goodnight my little prince\n\nThat's how good daddy takes care of him\n\nAnd then that good daddy goes downstairs to package heroine",
