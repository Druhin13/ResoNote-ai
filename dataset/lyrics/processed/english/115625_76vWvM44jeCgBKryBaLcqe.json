  "lyrics": "Trying to hold my head up\r\nI've been thinking about this mess we've made\r\n'Cause I shouldn't have to blame myself\r\nTook what was taught as gospel\r\nBut I don't have a clue where to go form here\r\n'Cause I'm almost breaking, can't you tell?\n\n\n\nI don't even understand why I'm still here\n\nJust need a minute to go through with it\n\nI don't even understand why I'm still here\n\n\n\nI gave you my all but you still want more\n\nI thought you were proud but it's not enough\n\nTried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy\n\nYou don't decide, just thought I'd let you know\n\nJust thought I'd let you know\n\nJust thought I'd let you know\n\n\n\nNot trying to play the victim\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest\n\nIt feels like my senses have kicked in\n\n\n\nI don't even understand why I'm still here\n\nJust need a minute to go through with it\n\nI don't even understand why I'm still here\n\n\n\nI gave you my all but you still want more\n\nI thought you were proud but it's not enough\n\nTried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy\n\nYou don't decide, just thought I'd let you know\n\nJust thought I'd let you know\n\nJust thought I'd let you know\n\n\n\nI gave you my all but you still want more\n\nI thought you were proud but it's not enough\n\nTried to sell me a lie that you thought I'd buy\n\nYou don't decide, just thought I'd let you know\n\nJust thought I'd let you know\n\nJust thought I'd let you know",
