  "lyrics": "I bet you thought your life would change\r\nBut you're sat on a train again\r\nYour memories are sceneries\r\nFor things you said but never really meant\r\nYou build it to a high to say goodbye\r\nBecause you're not the same as them\n\nBut your death it won't happen to you\n\nIt happens to your family and your friends\n\nI pretend\n\n\n\nAnd I always wanna die, sometimes\n\nI always wanna die, sometimes\n\n\n\nYou win, you lose, you sing the blues\n\nThere's no point in buying concrete shoes\n\nI'll refuse\n\n\n\nAnd I always wanna die, sometimes\n\nI always wanna die, sometimes\n\nI always wanna die\n\n\n\nAm I me through geography?\n\nA face collapsed through entropy\n\nI can hardly speak\n\nAnd when I try, it's nothing but a squeak\n\nOn the video\n\nLiving room for small\n\nIf you can't survive, just try\n\n\n\nAnd I always wanna die, sometimes\n\nI always wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAnd I always wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die, sometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nSometimes\n\nI sometimes always wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna\n\nAlways wanna die\n\nAlways wanna\n\nAlways wanna die, sometimes",
