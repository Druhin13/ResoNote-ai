  "lyrics": "THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA \n\nIn sleep he sang to me, \nIn dreams he came... \nthat voice which calls to me \nand speaks my name... \n\n\n\nAnd do I dream again? \n\nFor now I find \n\nthe Phantom of the Opera \n\nis there- inside my mind... \n\n\n\nSing once again with me \n\nour strange duet... \n\nMy power over you \n\ngrows stronger yet... \n\n\n\nAnd though you turn from me, \n\nto glance behind, \n\nthe Phantom of the Opera \n\nis there- inside your mind... \n\n\n\nThose who have seen your face \n\ndraw back in fear... \n\nI am the mask you wear... \n\n\n\nIt's me they hear... \n\n\n\nYour/my spirit \n\nand your/my voice \n\nin one combined: \n\nthe Phantom of the Opera \n\nis there- inside your/my mind... \n\n\n\n(Off stage) He's there, \n\nthe Phantom on the Opera... \n\nBeware the Phantom of the Opera... \n\n\n\n(Phantom) In all your fantasies, \n\nyou always knew \n\nthat man and mystery... \n\n\n\n(Christine)...were both in you... \n\n\n\n(Both) And in this labyrinth \n\nwhere night is blind, \n\nthe Phantom of the Opera \n\nis there/here \n\ninside your/my mind... \n\n\n\nSing,my Angel of Music! \n\n\n\nHe's there \n\nthe Phantom of the Opera",
