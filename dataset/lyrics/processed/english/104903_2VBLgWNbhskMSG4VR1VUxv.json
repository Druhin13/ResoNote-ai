  "lyrics": "Turn me on turn me off then you turn me back on by the weekend\r\nAnd you won't say the words that I want but you flirt when you're drinkin'\r\nI see those bubbles pop up like you're texting then they disappear\r\nLet's cut through the shit then let's get to what we're doing here\r\nAre we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can\n\nAre we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand\n\nAre we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years\n\nAre we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand\n\n\n\nYeah, I want you to want me to take you back home to my mama\n\nPut my name on your lips call me yours and forget all this drama\n\nYour makeup is next to my toothbrush but you never put it away on the shelf\n\nI'm asking you baby cause I'm tired of asking myself\n\n\n\nAre we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can\n\nAre we names in a tattoo, or just a number on a hand\n\nAre we last call kissing, are we dancing in the kitchen, baby tell me what it is or what it isn't\n\nAre we written in the stars, baby, or are we written in the sand\n\n\n\nAre we just a backseat, tryna get it while we can\n\nAre we names in a tattoo, or just a number I should wash right off my hand\n\nAre we last call kissing or will we be reminiscing with each other for the next forty years\n\nAre we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand\n\nAre we written in the stars baby, or are we written in the sand",
