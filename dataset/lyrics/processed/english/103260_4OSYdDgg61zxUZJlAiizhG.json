  "lyrics": "This old heart of mine been broke a thousand times\r\nEach time you break away, feel you're gone to stay\r\nLonely nights that come, memories that go\r\nBringing you back again, hurting me more and more\r\nMaybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside\n\n'Cause each day that passes by\n\nYou got me never knowing if I'm coming or going\n\nBut I love you, yes I do\n\nI love you, this old heart weeps for you\n\n\n\nI try hard to hide my hurt inside\n\nThis old heart of mine always keeps me crying\n\nThe way you treat me leaves me incomplete\n\nYou're here for the day, gone for the week\n\n\n\nBut if I leave me a hundred times\n\nA hundred times I'll take you back\n\nI'm yours whenever you want me\n\nI want to shout about it, tell the world about it\n\n\n\n'Cause I love you, this old heart weeps for you\n\nI love you, this old heart weeps for you\n\n\n\nThis old heart of mine been broke a thousand times\n\nEach time you break away, feel you're gone to stay\n\nLonely nights that come, memories that go\n\nBringing you back again, hurting me more and more\n\n\n\nMaybe it's my mistake to show this love I feel inside\n\n'Cause each day that passes by\n\nYou got me never knowing if I'm coming or going\n\nBut I love you, yes I do\n\nThis old heart weeps for you\n\nI love you\n\nI love you, yes I do\n\nYes I do\n\nI love you, this old heart weeps for you\n\nI love you, darling weeps for you\n\nI love you, yes I do\n\nI love you",
