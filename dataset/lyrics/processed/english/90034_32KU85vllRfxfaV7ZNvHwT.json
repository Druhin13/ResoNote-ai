(your mind)\n\nAnd if you say yes am I allowed back in?\n\nI hate the way it falls down\n\nBut I like the way it all sounds\n\nSince you came back\n\nI been long gone\n\nWatchin' my walls\n\nAnd when you movin'\n\nI think I knew then\n\nThat everything was\n\nAnd all I want is your time\n\n\n\nIf I set fire to these walls right now (right now)\n\nWould I set foot inside your mind? (your mind)\n\nAnd if you say yes am I allowed back in?",
