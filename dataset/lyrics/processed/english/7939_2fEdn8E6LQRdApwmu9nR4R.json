Huh. White dude rapping too tough\n\nWhile I suit up\n\nWhite and Blue'd up\n\nSilver shoes stuck\n\nGetting loose touch-down\n\nGot all of the crowd reaching on down\n\nCleaning their shoes up\n\nMan and back when\n\nI remember them telling me to end\n\nThis vision in my medulla\n\nAnd now they telling me\n\nThat athletes that's rapping can't do much\n\nGotta go harder it's too much\n\nAll cause the stigma\n\nI reply with this first enigma\n\nGotta listen back just to learn the picture\n\nMy first description take the earth to spin\n\nBefore the verse can hit em\n\nI'm the first with skin rap elites\n\nBut actually it only took one to revert the system\n\nGet em\n\nLook at how I curve the rhythm\n\nJust squirtin venom like a nervous\n\nMaking moves like food trucks\n\nGetting to the bread til it's chewed up\n\nAnd my bank accounts look juiced up",
