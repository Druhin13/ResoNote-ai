  "lyrics": "When we were young the road was easy\r\nBut time moves on and people change\r\nIf we're not falling, we're not flying\r\nYou can't have love without the pain\r\nWhen I lose direction\n\nWhen I can't see the stars\n\nIf we get disconnected\n\nI'll sing my way back to Your heart\n\nI'll sing my way back to Your arms\n\n\n\nThere's a garden in the ashes\n\nThere is beauty in the mess\n\nIf we embrace our imperfections\n\nI know love will do the rest\n\n\n\nWhen I lose direction\n\nWhen I can't see the stars\n\nIf we get disconnected\n\nI'll sing my way back to Your heart\n\nI'll sing my way back to Your arms\n\n\n\nA million miles, a hundred lifetimes\n\nI'd never find another You\n\nI found a diamond in the desert\n\nAnother story wouldn't do\n\n\n\nWhen I lose direction\n\nWhen I can't see the stars\n\nIf we get disconnected\n\nI'll sing my way back to Your heart\n\nI'll sing my way back to Your arms",
