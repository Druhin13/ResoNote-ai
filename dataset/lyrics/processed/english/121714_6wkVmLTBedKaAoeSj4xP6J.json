  "lyrics": "I think I've found a way\r\nTo keep myself home\r\nI write my fears on green notes\r\nI swallow my doubts away\r\nAnd watch them grow old\r\nIs that why the past years seem slow?\n\n\n\nTake me\n\nMy heart and my soul\n\nPick me apart\n\nAnd look inside, inside\n\nFill me with dreams I can't hold\n\nKeep me afloat in this cold world, cold world\n\n\n\nTell me it won't hurt\n\nNow I-I'm your passenger\n\nThe old me won't work\n\nNow I-I'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\n\n\nOh I think I've found a way\n\nTo keep my hands full\n\nI spent long nights\n\nI question my self control\n\n\n\nTake me\n\nMy heart and my soul\n\nPick me apart\n\nAnd look inside, inside\n\nFill me with dreams I can't hold\n\nKeep me afloat in this cold world, cold world\n\n\n\nTell me it won't hurt\n\nNow I-I'm your passenger\n\nThe old me won't work\n\nNow I-I'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\n\n\nNow all of the that debts I owe\n\nOh, they keep me useful\n\nMy head held tall\n\nAnd I can accept what I lost\n\nThough you make balanced\n\nYou can't make me whole, so\n\n\n\nTell me it won't hurt\n\nNow I-I'm your passenger\n\nThe old me won't work\n\nNow I-I'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger\n\nI'm your passenger",
