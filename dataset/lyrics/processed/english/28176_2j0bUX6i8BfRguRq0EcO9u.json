  "lyrics": "On the cross hung my pain\r\nAnd the guilt and the shame\r\nJesus bore my suffering\r\nTo the grave to make me free\r\nOh the blood that was shed\n\nIt now flows to cover sin\n\nIt washes clean and purifies\n\nIn its healing crimson tide\n\n\n\nJesus, He took my place\n\nIn divine exchange\n\nHallelujah! Grace is mine\n\nNow I will live by faith\n\nFor the One who saves\n\nHe gave all to give me life\n\n\n\nHis spirit is my present help\n\nI'd be lost all by myself\n\nHe resurrects, He sanctifies\n\nHe takes His powâ€™r and makes it mine\n\n\n\nJesus, He took my place\n\nIn divine exchange\n\nHallelujah! Grace is mine\n\nNow I will live\n\nNow I will live by faith\n\nFor the One who saves\n\nHe gave all to give me life\n\n\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive inside of me\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive inside of me\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive inside of me\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive inside of me\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive inside of me\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive, oh\n\n\n\nJesus, He took my place\n\nIn divine exchange\n\nHallelujah! Grace is mine\n\nNow I will live\n\nNow I will live by faith\n\nFor the One who saves\n\nHe gave all to give me life\n\nJesus\n\nJesus, He took my place\n\nIn divine exchange\n\nHallelujah\n\nHallelujah! Grace is mine\n\nNow I will live\n\nNow I will live by faith\n\nFor the One who saves\n\nHe gave all\n\nHe gave all to give me life\n\n\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive inside of me\n\nI lay down all lesser things for greater gain\n\nHe is alive",
