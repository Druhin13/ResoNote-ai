  "lyrics": "You and I, we stole our highs and ran a while with the rosy eyes\r\nI'd do it again if I survive\r\nBut that ain't worth the risk, no\r\nHand of gold but I can't let go\r\nReach your bones and broken toes\r\nI've been doing it 'til heaven shows\n\n[?] feet, I'm screaming [?]\n\n\n\nBow down and hurt\n\nLook what you do\n\nTo the woman who loves you\n\nBut I keep hoping for the best\n\nTo the girls that you tried to fool\n\nIt's not what you say or do\n\nIt's all the many ways that you break us\n\n\n\nYour kingdom fell and took apart that little beast that made your heart\n\nGet it back so you can be a better man than what we see\n\nCut the ties, I beg you please\n\nI cannot take a soul asleep\n\n[?] with you with me in tow\n\nFor me, it's not what I was sold\n\n\n\nBow down and hurt\n\nLook what you do\n\nTo the woman who loves you\n\nBut I keep hoping for the best\n\nTo the girls that you tried to fool\n\nIt's not what you say or do\n\nIt's all the many ways that you break us",
