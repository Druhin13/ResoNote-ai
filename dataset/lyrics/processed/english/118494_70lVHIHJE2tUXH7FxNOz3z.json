Show so much respect to you\n\nThat I feel like we're friends, so now we no longer competitors\n\nThat could be the death of you\n\nNever let someone who's not as smart as you\n\nGas you up and tell you somethin' you never knew\n\nAlways stay professional, you always gon' make revenue\n\nDon't let people next to you that don't want the best for you\n\nIt's completely normal to hold on to a regret or two\n\nI do what I wanna do, they do what I let them do\n\nEverything these niggas be sayin' is a fuckin' lie\n\nIt's nothing I can say to you that is realer\n\nRemember when you praisin' the butterfly\n\nDon't you ever disrespect the fuckin' caterpillar\n\n\n\nThis right here for the number one\n\nNumber ones here with your number one\n\nYou ain't number one, just another one\n\nNow everybody sayin' that they number one\n\nKid think your number won't quit\n\nNumber one song, get your number one chick\n\nNumber one fly with your number one kick\n\nWhen it's all done then your number gon' switch\n\n\n\nYou're looking at Atilla, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar\n\nDon't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until, uh\n\nEspecially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill\n\nA savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack at a silver-back gorilla\n\nYou're havin' a little trouble fathomin' this is actually happenin'\n\nLike Anderson Silva back when he snapped his shin in half\n\nAnd then had the shit hangin' by a flap of skin\n\nAfter he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again\n\nPad to pen Iâ€™m batty like eyelids when they're blinkin' a lot\n\nYou copy me, but you're not\n\nYou can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths\n\nI see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off\n\nSo ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off of the wall\n\nSet the sprinklers off like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah\n\n'Till the shingles come off the roof we'll shout at the ceiling\n\nSlaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers aloft\n\nSay what I think when I rhyme, in ink-pen I talk\n\nAnd the language I speak is my mind\n\nKingpin and Penguin combined\n\nSpit like it's King of the Dot\n\nA singular thought I think of will help you distinguish apart\n\nThe frauds from the cream of the crop\n\n(Wait a minute) Hold up like a flashcard\n\nDamn dawg, is that copyin' or payin' homage?\n\nIt's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler\n\nMy dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on you\n\nCome back as black wasp, half yellow jacket, you can't swat a\n\nSasquatch dancing on top of an ant trample it and stomp it\n\nSmash it and stand on it, dammit, I can't stop it\n\nThe rap is a vag' and I'm goin' in like a tampon in this bitch\n\nIt's a manslaughter\n\nStampin' out grasshoppers, you can't be no Rap Gods\n\nIn fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song\n\nAnd can't hold a candle but even Daniel-son whacks off\n\nYou jack-offs need to come to grips like a hand job\n\nThe boom bap is coming back with an axe to mumble rap\n\nLumberjack with a hacksaw\n\nNumber one, but my pencils are number twos\n\n'Cause that's all I dos with 'em, poop is my pseudonym\n\nOn the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin' a deuce\n\nAnd when I'm producing them lyrical bowel movements\n\nThese beats are like my saloons\n\n'Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em\n\nAnd I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em\n\nBitch, shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem\n\nI'm 'bout to go spin a cocoon\n\nThen I'm cuttin' you from your mother's womb\n\nThen I'm flushin' you!",
