  "lyrics": "All black draping, drawstrings hanging, \nBet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, \nBet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, \nEverything it does for me is all in correlation \nOf me draping that up over me and keeping what it came with, \nKnow they're hand in hand and ain’t no way to separate it, \n\nAin’t no room for separation, only room to fit inside it, \n\nRoom enough to be who they assume you coincide with, \n\nLike pulling on the drawstrings and running up inside of \n\nWhere it’s at like “where it at?!” and leaving out with that beside us, \n\nOr pulling on the drawstrings to run from who behind us \n\nTil we happen to be back to where we had to need reminding, \n\nRemind us of the shit you was taught and still agree with, \n\nAnd how you can’t forget what you thought but never seen it, \n\nAnd if you did see what you thought, you couldn’t leave it, \n\nIt turned everything that you saw into a sequence, \n\nSimilar but different and all like it’s a remix, \n\nBut bet you that hoodie is with me through any season, \n\nBet it holds me over if somebody's rolling over \n\nSaying that I look familiar but they needed to see me closer, \n\nBet you that it got me if they got me in they’re line \n\nWith an infrared light show following behind, \n\nBet you it got me covered if we talking about coverage \n\nAnd debating on the light that should be thrown up at the subject \n\nIf the light that was behind me carried out on what it wanted \n\nAnd turned bright enough to blind out any discussion, \n\nOn how it should all be blamed on this draping that we covet, \n\nKeep it all sacred my cape be on out in public, \n\nCause it could never harm me, it just takes away what does \n\nAnd then replaces it with all that they would say I never was, \n\nIt takes what they believed and leaves them to second guess it, \n\nTo where they wanna be it and see if they can reflect it, \n\nBet you that it’s with me if I’m fighting for a city \n\nThat’s electing to align with whoever’s up against me \n\nAnd they’re looking at my kind as a reason to forget me \n\nAnd I’m moving like it’s fine for everyone who defends me, \n\nI bet you that it got me when 12 is driving by me \n\nAnd wondering if I’m low enough for them to hide me, \n\nAnd it got me if I need it to describe my intentions \n\nAnd it’s loyal to the point where it defines who I been with, \n\nAnd it got me if I need it to perform when they reaching, \n\nIf they catch me then I know this cape on me if I’m leaking, \n\nIt’ll catch whatever’s pouring to the floor before I see it, \n\nAnd it’ll be the reason your applause runs the deepest, \n\nAnd it’ll catch whatever might pour from your peoples, \n\nLeaning on the top of it, \n\nFace on the shoulder of it, looking for the obvious, \n\nPushing for a reason tryna seek to where the bottom is, \n\nSwear it ain’t no stopping it, \n\nAll black draping, drawstrings hanging, \n\nBet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, \n\nBet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, \n\nEverything it does for me is all in correlation, \n\nAll black draping, drawstrings hanging, \n\nBet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, \n\nBet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, \n\nEverything it does for me is all in correlation \n\n\n\nBet you that it’ll protect you \n\nThe way it protects me \n\nAnd it won’t let you ever forget me, \n\nIt won’t let you ever regret me \n\nNo it won’t \n\nBet you that it’ll protect you \n\nThe way it protects me \n\nAnd it won’t let you ever forget me, \n\nIt won’t let you ever regret me \n\nNo it won’t",
