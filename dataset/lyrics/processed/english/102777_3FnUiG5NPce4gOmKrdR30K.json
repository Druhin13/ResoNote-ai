  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Unforgettable par Thomas Rhett\r\nIt was the 14th of October\nHad that t-shirt off your shoulder\nI was drunk, said I was sober\nAnd you said yeah right\nWe were talkin’ for a minute\nThen some guy tried to cut in\nYou took my hand and we pretended\nLike I was your guy\n\nOh, then I tried to guess your middle name\nFor 30 minutes bet we played that game\n\nThat mango-rita you were drinkin’\nAnd that Coldplay song that you were singin’\nAnd I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’\nThat it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do\n\nFrom your blue jeans to your shoes\nGirl, that night was just like you\nUnforgettable\n\nWe were dancin’, we were buzzin’\nTakin’ shots like it was nothin’\nDid the runnin’ man, you loved it\nYeah, you laughed out loud\nYou brushed away your blonde hair\nAnd you kissed me out of nowhere\nI can still show you the spot\nWhere everything went down\n\nOh, I told you I was gonna marry you\nYou probably didn’t think that it was true\n\nThat mango-rita you were drinkin’\nAnd that Coldplay song that you were singin’\n\nAnd I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’\nThat it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do\nI can still smell your perfume\nGirl, that night was just like you\nUnforgettable\n\nOh, that night was just like you, baby\nI can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin’\nAnd it feels just like it was last weekend\nThat we jumped in\nRight off the deep end\n\nThat mango-rita you were drinkin’\nAnd that Coldplay song that you were singin’\nAnd I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’\nThat it’s crazy I remember every detail, but I do\n\nI can still smell your perfume\nGirl, that night was just like you\nUnforgettable\n\nFrom your blue jeans to your shoes\nGirl, that night was just like you\nUnforgettable",
