  "lyrics": "(Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Mike Campbell)\r\nIt was a beautiful day, the sun beat down\r\nI had the radio on, I was drivin'\r\nTrees flew by, me and Del were singin' little Runaway\r\nI was flyin'\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nYeah runnin' down a dream\n\nThat never would come to me\n\nWorkin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads\n\nRunnin' down a dream\n\n\n\nI felt so good like anything was possible\n\nI hit cruise control and rubbed my eyes\n\nThe last three days the rain was un-stoppable\n\nIt was always cold, no sunshine\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nI rolled on as the sky grew dark\n\nI put the pedal down to make some time\n\nThere's something good waitin' down this road\n\nI'm pickin' up whatever's mine\n\n\n\n[Chorus Out]",
