  "lyrics": "When the taste hits my lips and it's as good as it gets\r\nMakes it easy to forget what I should, shouldn’t do\r\nIt don't take much to get me out and every time I cross that line\r\nYeah, it makes me feel like I'm on fire and bulletproof\r\nMaker’s Mark, Marlboros, and you\n\n\n\nBut morning after, I get low, my pride sinking like a stone\n\nCold and empty handle, oh no, swear to God I'm through\n\nSilence is a heavy sound, the hardest kind of coming down\n\nThe kind of feeling I feel now and every time I use\n\n\n\nMaker's Mark, Marlboros, and you\n\nMaker's Mark, Marlboros, and you\n\n\n\nBaby, believe me\n\nTomorrow, I'll be alright\n\n'Cause quitting you is easy\n\nI've done it a hundred times\n\n\n\nWell, habit's a bitch to break and hardships wanna get their way\n\nAnd then that memory’s all it takes and I’m running right back to\n\n\n\nMaker's Mark, Marlboros, and you\n\nMaker’s Mark, Marlboros, and you",
