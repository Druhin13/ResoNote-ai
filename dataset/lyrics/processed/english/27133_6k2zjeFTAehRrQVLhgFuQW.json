  "lyrics": "This crown of misery\r\nNo remorse, no sympathy\r\nIn my absence, I am reborn, go\r\nAs good as fucking dead\r\nWe are down but not done yet\n\nThe hope I see for what I seek\n\nIs never lost in me\n\n\n\nLet these words be known to you\n\nI will not rest until we're through\n\nTime and time again, you deny\n\nSo now we defy\n\n\n\nThere will be hell to pay\n\nThis crown of misery\n\nNo remorse, no sympathy\n\n\n\nI see you as the enemy\n\nBut I've learned to control my aggression\n\nThis void in me you'll never see\n\nIt's as dead as you are to me\n\n\n\nNot all that's lost is never found\n\nThe fear will leave you crippled on the ground\n\nClawing at the wounds you thought would never heal\n\n\n\nI will not rest until you feel what I feel\n\nTake your last breath and set me free\n\nI will not rest until you feel what I feel\n\nTake your last breath, before us you will kneel\n\n\n\nThere will be hell to pay\n\nThis crown of misery\n\nNo remorse, no sympathy\n\n\n\nI see you as the enemy\n\nBut I've learned to control my aggression\n\nThis void in me you'll never see\n\nIt's as dead as you are to me\n\n\n\nIt's our mistake, we let you in again\n\nStaring through blistered eyes\n\n\n\nNothing you say will change the way I feel\n\nMake no mistake\n\nThis void in me you'll never see\n\nStaring through blistered eyes\n\n\n\nStaring through blistered eyes",
