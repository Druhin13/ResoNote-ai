  "lyrics": "Weird times\r\nIt's a fantasy\r\nAll you read in the magazines\r\nMother Nature\r\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\r\nBut then I realize\n\nCertain type\n\nIn the compound\n\n??\n\nSupermodel cocktail\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\nShe's got a finger on the button ready to delete\n\nI'm so lucky now in the darkness\n\nDon't get him a ?? by the lights\n\nIt's all gonna come down on you\n\nBut when it all came down there were no signs\n\nBut I'm in a time of separation\n\nParalysed by by her own nature\n\nBloodlines another war game\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\n?? I'm sinking\n\nLike at the compound\n\nHold the lines start searching\n\nNext man playing on his fantasies\n\n\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\n\n\nI'm so lucky now in the darkness\n\nDon't get him a ?? by the lights\n\nAnd how to see that wonder\n\n?? it's gonna be too late\n\nToo late\n\nStart looking out at the darkness\n\nDon't get him a ?? by the lights\n\nIt's all gonna come down to you\n\nWhen I'm walking down there are no signs\n\nWalk the walk\n\n\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk\n\nBaby you're the one who can walk the walk",
