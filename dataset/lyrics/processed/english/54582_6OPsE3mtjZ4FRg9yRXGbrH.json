  "lyrics": "You can't see me yet\r\nSeeing takes a long, long time\r\nFrom the outside in\r\nMeasuring each shift and sigh\r\nBut as you let your eyes adjust\n\nTo the darkness deep within\n\nSifting throughthe ash and dust\n\nWe are the places that we've been\n\n\n\nYou can't hear me yet\n\nListening takes a long, long time\n\nAnd I've so much to tell\n\nBut words die on these lips of mine\n\n\n\nBut in the stillness you may sense\n\nEvery thing I long to say\n\nUnraveling like golden threads\n\nThe walls will all come down this way\n\n\n\nYou don't know me yet\n\nKnowing takes a long, long time\n\nAnd time is all we have\n\nNever traveling in straight lines\n\n\n\nSo memorize each turn and twist\n\nJust be careful as you go\n\nFor if love is a labyrinth\n\n\n\nThen my heart is Jericho",
