Make that change!)\n\nI've got to make that change, today!\n\nHoo!\n\n(Man in the mirror)\n\nYou got to\n\nYou got to not let yourself\n\nBrother\n\nHoo!\n\n(Yeah! Make that change!)\n\nYou know, I've got to get\n\nThat man, that man\n\n(Man in the mirror)\n\nYou've got to move! Chime on!\n\nChime on!\n\nYou got to\n\nStand up! Stand up! Stand up!\n\n(Yeah! Make that change)\n\nStand up and lift yourself, now!\n\n(Man in the mirror)\n\nYou know it!\n\nYou know it!\n\nYou know it!\n\nYou know it\n\n(Change)\n\nMake that change",
