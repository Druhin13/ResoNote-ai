  "lyrics": "Well you never liked them much\r\nBut I broke out these old boots again\r\nGonna jump in that old truck\r\nHead down to the bar and hang out with an old friend\r\nBeen a while since I fired up a cigarette\r\nAnd got drunk on some draft beer\n\nWell where I’m going tonight\n\nThere’s a good chance you won’t want me back here\n\nI tried to be what you were looking for\n\nBut I can’t do that anymore\n\n\n\nI'm better at being at who I am\n\nBetter at letting my rebel run\n\nAnd nothing about me worth a damn\n\nIf I can’t be my old man’s son\n\nYour world and mine are worlds apart\n\nThis 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard\n\nBeing something that ain't never had a chance\n\nI’m better at being who I am\n\n\n\nI wasn’t ever gonna change\n\nI don’t know who in the hell I thought I was kiddin’\n\nFor a little while there it seemed like the sex would make it all alright but it didn’t\n\nThis ain’t my side of the tracks\n\nI got good at forgetting that\n\n\n\nI’m better at being who I am\n\nBetter at letting my rebel run\n\nAin’t nothing about me worth a damn\n\nIf I can’t be my old man’s son\n\nYour world and mine are worlds apart\n\nThis 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard\n\nBeing something I ain’t never had a chance\n\nI’m better at being back on my side of town\n\nBack down to earth\n\nA blue jean boy and a flannel shirt\n\nI’m just not what you deserve\n\nFor what it’s worth, for what it’s worth\n\n\n\nI'm better at being at who I am\n\nBetter at letting my rebel run\n\nAnd nothing about me is worth a damn\n\nIf I can’t be my old man’s son\n\nYour world and mine are worlds apart\n\nThis 'square peg, round hole' thing's too hard\n\nBeing something I ain't never had a chance\n\nI’m better at being who I am",
