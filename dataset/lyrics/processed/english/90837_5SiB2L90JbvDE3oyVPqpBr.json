  "lyrics": "Little red dress hanging on a hanger\r\nYou only wear it when you're feeling dangerous\r\nHope you slip it on slow in the mirror\r\nAnd it makes you want to drink too much\r\nBut when you can't unzip yourself, so you ask for a little help\r\nThrough a red wine, \"kiss-me\" smile\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\n\n\nAnd I hope 1:15 rolls around\n\nAnd you need me, like I need you right now\n\nYeah, I don't care what we said\n\nIf I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet\n\nYeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light\n\nWe've been on again, and off again so many times\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\n\n\nHope you're in the back of a yellow cab\n\nAnd a song comes on from way back when\n\nThe one that flips that switch inside you, makes you want to pull me in\n\nAnd when you sing right up the stairs, while you're taking down your hair\n\nIt sets the room on fire\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\n\n\nAnd I hope 1:15 rolls around\n\nAnd you need me, like I need you right now\n\nYeah, I don't care what we said\n\nIf I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet\n\nYou and me are kinda like that blinking caution light\n\nWe've been on again, and off again so many times\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\n\n\nI hope your head is on your phone\n\nAnd you don't want to be alone\n\nI really want to be alone\n\n\n\nAnd 1:15 rolls around\n\nAnd you need me, like I need you right now\n\nYeah, I don't care, what we said\n\nIf I'm on your mind, it ain't over, not yet\n\nYeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light\n\nWe've been on again, and off again so many times\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\nI hope it's on tonight",
