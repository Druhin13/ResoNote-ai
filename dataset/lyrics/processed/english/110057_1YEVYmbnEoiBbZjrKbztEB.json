  "lyrics": "Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear? \nAngie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? \nWith no loving in our souls and no money in our coats \nYou can't say we're satisfied \nBut Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried \nAngie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said good-bye? \n\nAngie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried? \n\nAll the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke \n\nLet me whisper in your ear: \n\nAngie, Angie, where will it lead us from here? \n\n\n\nOh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet \n\nI hate that sadness in your eyes \n\nBut Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said good-bye? \n\nWith no loving in our souls and no money in our coats \n\nYou can't say we're satisfied \n\nBut Angie, I still love you, baby \n\nEv'rywhere I look I see your eyes \n\nThere ain't a woman that comes close to you \n\nCome on Baby, dry your eyes \n\nBut Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive? \n\nAngie, Angie, they can't say we never tried",
