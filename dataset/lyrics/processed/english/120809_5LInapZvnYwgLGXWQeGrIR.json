  "lyrics": "There's multiple types of love\r\nI think the nicest kind is, of course, is, the deepest kind\r\nI think I've found it, but it's not...\r\nIt like something that's not constant\r\nIt comes and goes, for me at least\r\nI still love people I'm not with\n\nIt just transforms into a different kind\n\nIt’s just my dumb opinion i don’t know anything\n\nBut that's cool, I like not knowing\n\nI think life would be dull if you knew everything\n\nI cherish everything that feels real at least at the moment\n\nBecause I think we live in a world where a lot of things are not...\n\nVery real",
