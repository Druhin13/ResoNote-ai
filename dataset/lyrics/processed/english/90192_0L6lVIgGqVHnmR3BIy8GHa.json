  "lyrics": "Andromeda's a big, wide open galaxy\r\nNothing in it for me except a heart that's lazy\r\nRunning from my own life now\r\nI'm really turning some time\r\nLooking up to the sky for something I may never find\n\nStop calling\n\nIt's time to let me be\n\nIf you think you can save me\n\nI'd dare you to try\n\n\n\nLift the heart from the depths it's fallen to\n\nWe all want something new\n\nBut can't seem to follow through\n\nSomething's better than nothing\n\nOr so that I thought\n\nNow I know it's just one dream\n\nAll these others gonna tear me apart\n\n\n\nLove is calling\n\nIt's time to let it through\n\nFind a love that will make you\n\nI dare you try\n\n\n\nCrazy guy\n\nI think this is deep\n\nThink it's meant to be\n\nMore than anything I can think of\n\nI'm ready to try\n\n\n\nTreat me right\n\nI'm still a good man's daughter\n\nLet me in if I break\n\nAnd be quiet if I shatter\n\nGetting tired of looking\n\nYou know that I hate the game\n\nDon't wanna waste any more time\n\nYou know I been holding out\n\n\n\nLove is calling\n\nIt's time to give to you\n\nSomething you can hold onto\n\nI dare you try",
