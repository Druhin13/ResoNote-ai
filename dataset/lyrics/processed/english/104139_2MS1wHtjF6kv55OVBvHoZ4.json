  "lyrics": "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound\r\nThat saved a wretch like me\r\nI once was lost but now am found\r\nWas blind but now I see\r\nIt was grace that taught my heart to fear\n\nAnd grace my fears relieved\n\nHow precious did that grace appear\n\nThe hour I first believed\n\n\n\nThrough many dangers, toils and snares\n\nI have already come\n\n'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far\n\nAnd grace will lead me home\n\n\n\nHow sweet the name of Jesus sounds\n\nIn a believer's ear\n\nIt soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds\n\nAnd drives away his fear\n\n\n\nMust Jesus bear the cross alone\n\nAnd all the world go free\n\nNo, there's a cross for you\n\nAnd there's a cross for me",
