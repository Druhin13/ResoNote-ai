  "lyrics": "I don't own nothin' new\r\nI might look like a mess to you\r\nBut I'm solid\r\nThis ol' thing I drive around\r\nGot some rust, makes some funny sounds\n\nBut it's paid for and solid\n\n\n\nYou may think I'm way too chill\n\nBut I get it done, got my daddy's will\n\nAnd I'll always, I'll always keep a promise\n\n\n\nIn a great big world, spinnin' around\n\nPeople walkin' around on shaky ground\n\nMy foundation's solid\n\nLike a vessel gettin' tossed on the big blue sea\n\nTryin' to rock me off my feet\n\nIt's you that keeps me solid\n\n\n\nEverybody wants me to think like they do\n\nPut my faith in somethin' new\n\nBut this old school is tried and true, it's solid\n\n\n\nGot these 501's back in '93\n\nYeah the blue's all gone, you can see my knees\n\nBut to me man, they're still solid\n\n\n\nThis old scarred-up piece of wood\n\nSounds a lot better than it looks\n\nI can't count the nights that it's caught me when I was fallin'\n\n\n\nIn a great big world, spinnin' around\n\nPeople walkin' around on shaky ground\n\nMy foundation's solid\n\nLike a vessel gettin' tossed on the big blue sea\n\nTryin' to knock me off my feet\n\nIt's you that keeps me solid\n\n\n\nIt's been a lotta years since I've taken this road home\n\nIt's still not paved, Mama and Daddy's gone\n\nBut the gravel in my soul is solid",
