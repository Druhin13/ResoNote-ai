  "lyrics": "Bye bye, pretty woman\r\nI've got to leave you now\r\nI find you never really cared\r\nStand back, take a look at you\r\nYou couldn't care if you wanted to\n\nYou keep saying it's gonna change\n\nBut every time it comes back again\n\nIt's a merry-go-round\n\n\n\nEndless lies shine in your eyes\n\n\n\nIt's alright, count to ten\n\nIt will all be better then\n\nIt's alright, the world will go away\n\n\n\nStand back, take a look at you\n\nYou couldn't care if you wanted to\n\nYou keep saying it's gonna change\n\nBut every time it comes back again\n\nIt's a merry-go-round\n\n\n\nEndless lies, I can see it in your eyes\n\nThe heartbreak is, if you could only see\n\nThat's not the way it's supposed to be\n\nEndless tears that flowed through the years\n\nYou take it all, and then you take some more\n\nThen you come running back to me\n\n\n\nPlay on, pretty music\n\nPlay on and on for me\n\nShine on, silver stars\n\nOver the sea\n\n\n\nEndless lies, I can see it in your eyes\n\nThe heartbreak is, if you could only see\n\nThat's not the way it's supposed to be\n\n\n\nEndless lies shine in your eyes",
