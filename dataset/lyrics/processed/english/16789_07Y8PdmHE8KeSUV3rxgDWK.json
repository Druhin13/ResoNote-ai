  "lyrics": "I can be there\r\nI saw it there\r\nBut I don't know\r\nI'll have to call you later\r\nI'm sorry\n\nTell me say I'm a God, I don't feel like one\n\nI feel like I'm stuck here waiting for a text back\n\nWhats a conversation?\n\nTell me what is true love, I'm trying to find that\n\nNever could I escape having brought you down\n\nI want more, you keep your heart a secret\n\nI had something till I went and lost it\n\nAnd now it's totally abandoned\n\n\n\nI think her blood is toxic, that's why she won't let me in\n\nI called her old roommate just to hear what she'd say\n\nAnd if there's passion in you, I'm trying to find it\n\nAnd if I can't have what I want, what's the point of anything?\n\n\n\nTell me why I'm in pain, why I feel ashamed?\n\nTo want love and all of its burdens\n\nTo take and totally possess her\n\nAnd still I wait for invitations\n\n\n\nI thought if I dreamt it then something might happen\n\nI tried to light a candle, it came back to burn me\n\nAnd if there's passion in you, I'm trying to find it\n\nAnd if I can't have what i want, what's the point of anything?",
