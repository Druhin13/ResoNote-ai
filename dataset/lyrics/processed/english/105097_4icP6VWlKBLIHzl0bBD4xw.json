  "lyrics": "I am a light sleeper\r\nBut I am a heavy dreamer\r\nMy imagination gives me wings\r\nAnd I can go anywhere\r\nAnd when I wander away to some other place\n\nI’m suddenly there way up in the air \n\nWhere passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames\n\nAnd that black rabbit of death wakes up in a breath of beautiful dreams\n\nMy heartache it seems so terrible vague where fire and diamonds fall like rain\n\n\n\nDo you believe in endless miracles?\n\nDo you believe in the impossible?\n\nDo you believe sleep as a time machine?\n\n\n\nDo you believe in curiosity?\n\nDo you believe in what you cannot see?\n\nDo you believe life is a lucid dream?\n\n\n\nWell, that’s how you study the stars\n\nThat’s how you study the stars\n\nAnd that’s how you know ‘em by heart\n\nLife is a lucid dream\n\n\n\nSuch is the path of a dreamer\n\nI find my way by moonlight\n\nMy imagination gives me wings\n\nAnd I can go anywhere\n\n\n\nAnd when I wander away to some other place\n\nI’m suddenly there way up in the air \n\nWhere passenger trains catch fire and fill the sky with flames\n\nAnd that black rabbit of death wakes up in a breath of beautiful dreams\n\nMy heartache it seems so terrible vague where fire and diamonds fall like rain\n\n\n\nDo you believe in endless miracles?\n\nDo you believe in the impossible?\n\nDo you believe sleep as a time machine?\n\n\n\nDo you believe in curiosity?\n\nDo you believe in what you cannot see?\n\nDo you believe life is a lucid dream?\n\n\n\nWell, that’s how you study the stars\n\nThat’s how you study the stars\n\nAnd that’s how you know ‘em by heart\n\nLife is a lucid dream\n\n\n\nWell, that’s how you study the stars\n\nThat’s how you study the stars\n\nAnd that’s how you know ‘em by heart\n\nLife is a lucid dream\n\n\n\nI am a light sleeper\n\nBut I am a heavy dreamer",
