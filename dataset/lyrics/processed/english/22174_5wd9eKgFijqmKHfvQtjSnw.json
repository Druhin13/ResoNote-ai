  "lyrics": "She, she screams in silence\r\nA sullen riot penetrating through her mind\r\nWaiting for a sign\r\nTo smash the silence with the brick of self-control\r\nAre you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?\n\nAre you feeling like a social tool without a use?\n\n\n\nWell scream at me\n\nUntil my ears bleed\n\nAnd I'm taking heed\n\nJust for you\n\n\n\nShe, she's figured out\n\nAll her doubts were someone else's point of view\n\nWaking up this time\n\nTo smash the silence with the brick of self-control\n\n\n\nAre you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?\n\nAre you feeling like a social tool without a use?\n\n\n\nWell scream at me\n\nUntil my ears bleed\n\nAnd I'm taking heed\n\nJust for you\n\n\n\nAre you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?\n\nAre you feeling like a social tool without a use?\n\n\n\nWell scream at me\n\nUntil my ears bleed\n\nAnd I'm taking heed\n\nJust for you\n\n\n\nWell scream at me\n\nUntil my ears bleed\n\nAnd I'm taking heed\n\nJust for you",
