  "lyrics": "Walk into the bar\r\nAnd shake off my coat\r\nPull up a chair\r\nAnd light up a smoke\r\nWhere did all those summers go?\n\nGuess I'll never know\n\nSo barkeep let's give it a go\n\n\n\nPour me a dream\n\nAnd play me a tune\n\nAnd I'll get along\n\nJust as long\n\nAs I have a song\n\n\n\nSit by the church\n\nAnd hear children sing\n\nI like to pretend they're\n\nSinging for me\n\n\n\nMemories of melodies\n\nAnd words that made me cry\n\nThey have all abandoned me\n\nSit back and watch me die\n\n\n\nPour me a dream\n\nAnd play me a tune\n\nAnd I'll get along\n\nJust as long\n\nAs I have a song\n\n\n\nThe river is wide\n\nAnd the ocean's so deep\n\nThe harder I try\n\nThe faster I sink into the rich of the dark\n\nThe cheapest of tricks\n\nI've lost the fire\n\nStill I'm sharpening my wick\n\nBut it's just smoke\n\nAnd that's all\n\n\n\nSo pour me a tune\n\nAs blue as the moon\n\nAnd I'll get along\n\nJust as long\n\nAs I have a song\n\nI'll hum along\n\nAnd that is how I'll\n\nGet along",
