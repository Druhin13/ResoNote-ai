  "lyrics": "Same eyes, complexion\r\nNo love or affection\r\nSame time, same place\r\nBut you don't recognise my face\r\nI’m mad, you're crazy\r\nTreat me like your baby\n\nNo change, no change at all\n\n\n\nYeah, I've been through some phases and they’ve only tainted my view\n\nWe got similar faces but I don't feel nothing like you\n\n\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me\n\nI'm not waiting for, for your love\n\nYou can keep it\n\nI'm not waiting for you to come back\n\nFor you to let me down like that\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure\n\nI don't need it\n\n\n\nGrew harder, found laughter\n\nFound peace in all the cracks, oh\n\nDisaster, I happened\n\nI matter\n\n\n\nNo, no, you couldn't manage\n\nYou saw me as baggage, as deadweight\n\nNow the tables are turning\n\nOur bridges are burning\n\nIt’s too late\n\nThough the tears are still coming out, I found the courage\n\nThere’s no hate\n\n\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me\n\nI’m not waiting for, for your love\n\nYou can keep it\n\nI'm not waiting for you to come back\n\nFor you to let me down like that\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure\n\nI don't need it\n\n\n\nTaking me back to the way we were\n\n’Cause of you, I know what I deserve\n\nAlways the cause when i lost my nerve\n\nNo more\n\n\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me\n\nI'm not waiting for, for your love\n\nYou can keep it\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure, you to heal me\n\nI'm not waiting for, for your love\n\nYou can keep it\n\nI'm not waiting for you to come back\n\nFor you to let me down like that\n\nI'm not waiting for you to cure\n\nI don't need it",
