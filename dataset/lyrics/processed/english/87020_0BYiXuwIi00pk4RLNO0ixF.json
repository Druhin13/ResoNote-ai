  "lyrics": "here at the sign of the peacock\r\nwe find the club c'est sable\r\nit is a club dedicated to sad-ism\r\ni sit here all alone with a martini built for 2\r\ni sit here all alone 'cause i've got nothing better to do\r\ni sit here all alone with a martini built for 2\n\ni sit here all alone\n\nwell i showed up but where are you\n\nthe world we lived in departs\n\nbeneath rust colored clouds we weep\n\nyou're afraid of the dreams in the darkest part of your soul\n\nexchanging time for time\n\nthe world we lived in departs\n\nyou left me to stalk the night\n\ntell me\n\nare you mine\n\ncan i say i am yours\n\nit's a cold fading scene",
