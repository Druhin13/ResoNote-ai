  "lyrics": "Uh\r\nDaddy wasn't home\r\nMomma raised a thug\r\nThe life I gravitated toward she never didn't judge\r\nBut she never judged, her love was unconditional\r\nProbation conditional, evidence admissible\n\nTears on her ivory keys, glory in the lyrics\n\nSinging gods praise to anybody who could hear it\n\nThe end she doesn't fear it, words written in red\n\nIron weighs her down, but the girl lifting her head\n\nSon chasing bread, searching for some soul food\n\nWhen she preaches come, he says \"I'm in no mood\"\n\nCarnivore; never satisfied by tofu\n\nWild eyes blind to what he's 'bout to go through\n\n\n\nLivin' on a prayer, got a pocket full of stones\n\nOne day you're here, the next day you're gone\n\nWild eyes, wild eyes\n\nLivin' on a prayer, me against the world\n\nMommas boy chasing the devils little girl\n\nWild eyes, wild eyes\n\n\n\nI'm borrowed time, livin' off mommas prayers\n\nThe only one to ever see through all his rugged layers\n\nNobody really cares, banging me against the world\n\nIn the bottom of the black sea, fishing for a pearl\n\nListen to the words, missing all the meanings\n\nDeal going down, should probably sit it out this evening\n\nDevil on his shoulder, he gotta hit this lick\n\nThis what you been waiting on, and after this you can quit\n\nButterfly's got him sick, something don't seem kosher\n\nCops or the robbers go with or without the toaster\n\nNow verdicts on the poster, candles burning blue\n\nWild eyes blind to what he's 'bout to go through\n\n\n\nLivin' on a prayer, got a pocket full of stones\n\nOne day you're here, the next day you're gone\n\nWild eyes, wild eyes\n\nLivin' on a prayer, me against the world\n\nMommas boy chasing the devils little girl\n\nWild eyes, wild eyes\n\n\n\nPull in to the parking lot, dash for the cash\n\nHomie in the back, killer in the stash\n\nShawty actin funny, she don't even count the money\n\nThen she strikes off running, right then he see it coming\n\nBlue lights, black vests, everything is slow-mo\n\nHands in the air, throw them keys out the window\n\nKarma from his past is catching up with his ass\n\nThen he laughs as his momma says \"this too shall pass\"\n\nHandcuffs click, prison doors shut\n\nJudge looks down and says 57 months\n\nHis kingdom disappears, a lot of friends follow suit\n\nHis wild eyes open and he finally see the truth\n\n\n\nLivin' on a prayer, got a pocket full of stones\n\nOne day you're here, the next day you're gone\n\nWild eyes, wild eyes\n\nLivin' on a prayer, me against the world\n\nMommas boy chasing the devils little girl\n\nWild eyes, wild eyes",
