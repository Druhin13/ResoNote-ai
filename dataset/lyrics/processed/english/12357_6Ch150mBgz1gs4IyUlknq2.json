  "lyrics": "The bullet went into him\r\nHis skin did part in two\r\nSkin that women had touched\r\nThe bullet passed on through\r\nThe bullet went into him\n\nIt went its merry way\n\nLike an old grey dog\n\nOn a fox's trail\n\n\n\nThe bullet went into him\n\nHis stomach filled with food\n\nMany fine meals he tasted there\n\nBut the bullet passed on through\n\n\n\nThe bullet went into him\n\nIt went its merry way\n\nLike an old grey dog\n\nOn a fox's trail\n\n\n\nThe bullet went into him\n\nThrough his heart with thoughts of you\n\nWhere your kisses he inhaled\n\nThe lies and the truth\n\n\n\nThe bullet went into him\n\nTraveled up into his head\n\nThrough thoughts of love and hate\n\nThe living and the dead\n\n\n\nThe bullet went into him\n\nIt went its merry way\n\nLike an old grey dog\n\nOn a fox's trail",
