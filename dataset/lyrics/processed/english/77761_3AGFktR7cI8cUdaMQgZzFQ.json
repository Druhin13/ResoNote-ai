  "lyrics": "It ain't the way you crawl across the Cathouse floor\r\nIt ain't the way you curse me when you slam the bedroom door\r\nIt ain't the way you sweat me for a handful of easy cash\r\nIt's just the way you love me when you turn to trash\r\nTrash\r\nIt's not the way you dress when you socialize, oh those eyes\n\nIt ain't the diamond rock or that Rolls you drive\n\nYou can walk the streets with all your uptown flash\n\nBut when you hit the sheets you just turn trash\n\nYou're such trash\n\nI love the way you look\n\nYou're such high class tramp\n\nIt's not the way you touch me when you...\n\nYou're daddy's dream, you're a peach in cream\n\nAnd you're finally ripe at last\n\nBut when you hit the sheets you just turn to trash\n\nTrash",
