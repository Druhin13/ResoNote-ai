  "lyrics": "Time feels slower inside of my head\r\nCan I paint a picture of the world that I see instead?\r\nAnd I know it's bullshit they say I'm not really that bad\r\nBut I think too much and I'm scared I'm never coming back, yeah\r\nWalked into the bathroom just so I could cry\n\nWish I knew why, wish I knew why\n\nOh, baby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nI know you're reaching out but I push you away\n\nMaybe 'cause I'm vain, maybe 'cause I'm vain\n\nOh, baby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\n\n\nEasy, easy\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy? (Easy)\n\n\n\nTake some more pills, try to crack a smile\n\nThinking back to weekends that felt good\n\nYeah, it's been a while\n\nBut I try to scrape through and keep my head above the clouds\n\n'Cause I know myself and I know this isn't who I am, yeah\n\n\n\nWalked into the bathroom just so I could cry\n\nWish I knew why, wish I knew why\n\nOh, baby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nI know you're reaching out but I push you away\n\nMaybe 'cause I'm vain, maybe 'cause I'm vain\n\nOh, baby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\n\n\nEasy, easy\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\n\n\nWalked into the bathroom just so I could cry\n\nWish I knew why, wish I knew why\n\nOh, baby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nI know you're reaching out but I push you away\n\nMaybe 'cause I'm vain, maybe 'cause I'm vain\n\nOh, baby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\n\n\nEasy, easy\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?\n\nEasy, easy\n\nBaby, why don't you find someone easy?",
