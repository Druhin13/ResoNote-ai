  "lyrics": "I'll play the part of my favorite play\r\nI feel the art in all these ways\r\nNobody loves a hidden face\r\nSo let it just fade away\r\nKill this part that stays away\n\nHunting down that face, oh that face\n\nThose subtle rewards\n\nStrike gently chords, mmm\n\n\n\nIt's coming down for me this way\n\nI'll be calm for you and fearless\n\nIt's coming from a heated place\n\nA place that means it's something\n\nIt's coming down for me this way\n\nI'll be calm for you and fearless\n\n\n\nFollow that line that lead us that way\n\n'Cause there's beauty in not knowing fate\n\nLet's not cave into this fear\n\n'Cause we wanna be right here\n\nHold that part that we just made\n\nMmmm, let your voice go\n\nJust put your feet up on that pillow\n\nLet your blood know\n\nLet your blood go\n\nJust hold your breath\n\nJust hold my waist\n\nJust hold my waist\n\nJust hold my waist\n\n\n\nIt's coming down for me this way\n\nI'll be calm for you and fearless\n\nIt's coming from a heated place\n\nA place that means it's something\n\nIt's coming down for me this way\n\nI'll be calm for you and fearless\n\nIt's coming down for me this way\n\nI'll be calm for you and fearless\n\nIt's coming from a heated place\n\nA place that means it's something",
