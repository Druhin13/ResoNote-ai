  "lyrics": "If I was who I was before\r\nThen Iâ€™d be waiting at your door\r\nBut I cannot confess I am the same\r\nSo, look at me and hear me now\r\nWith all my body screaming out\r\nIn my mind I'm thinking of the place\n\n\n\nWhere no one knows me\n\nNo one knows you\n\nAnd you don't know me\n\nAnd I don't know you\n\n\n\nIf you would open up your heart\n\nDrop your weapons, drop your guard\n\nJust a little trust is all it takes\n\nOh, I know that you've been around\n\nBut hear me now, I'm crying out\n\nLet me be the light upon the lake\n\n\n\nBut if you give a little, get a little\n\nMaybe we could get to know each other\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\nAnd if you give a little, get a little\n\nMaybe we could learn to love each other\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\n\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\n\n\nIf only we could find a way\n\nTo leave all of our darker days\n\nSoak in all the sweetness on our skin\n\nOh, and if you're waiting in the Sun\n\nThen carry me on wings of love\n\nTo that brighter day where all begins\n\n\n\nAnd if you give a little, get a little\n\nMaybe we could get to know each other\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\nAnd if you give a little, get a little\n\nMaybe we could learn to love each other\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\n\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\n\n\nBut if you give a little, get a little\n\nMaybe we could get to know each other\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\nAnd if you give a little, get a little\n\nMaybe we could learn to love each other\n\nGive a little, get a little, give a little\n\n\n\nAnd no one knows me\n\nAnd no one knows you\n\nYou don't know me\n\nI don't know you\n\nEverything's fresh, yeah\n\nEverything's new\n\nBut you don't know me\n\nI don't know you\n\nI can feel it starting up now, yeah\n\nI can feel it all just coming through\n\nThere's a whole new world just waiting, baby\n\nSo much waiting just for me and you",
