I got off the ground\n\nI stood up when you left and, baby, look at me now\n\nLook at me now, yeah\n\nDid you hear about me? I'm making a name\n\nI got a little money just playing the game\n\nLook at me now, oh, look at me\n\n\n\nDid you see me driving with the windows down?\n\nYou said I'd never do it, well, I figured it out\n\nOh, look at me now\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you hear about me? You pushed me around\n\nBut now I'm pushing paper, baby, look at me now\n\nLook at me now, yeah\n\nDid you hear about me? You thought I'd give in\n\nYou try to hurt me, but you'll never do it again\n\nLook at me now, oh, look at me\n\nDid you hear about me? I got a new love\n\nSomebody I can count on, a love I can trust\n\nOh, look at me now, oh, look at me\n\nDid you hear about me? I'm living the dream\n\nEverything is better since you walked out on me\n\nLook at me now, oh, look at me\n\n\n\nWhy did you leave me? Didn't you care?\n\nDidn't you love me? Don't you wish I was there?\n\nOh, baby, please look at me now\n\n\n\nAre you hearing about me?\n\nHow you dealing without me?\n\nHello",
