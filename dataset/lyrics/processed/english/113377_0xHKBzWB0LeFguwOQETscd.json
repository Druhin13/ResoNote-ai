  "lyrics": "You don't bring me flowers\r\nYou don't sing me love songs\r\nYou hardly talk to me anymore\r\nWhen you come through the door\r\nAt the end of the day\n\nI remember when\n\nYou couldn't wait to love me\n\nUsed to hate to leave me\n\n\n\nNow after lovin' me late at night\n\nWhen it's good for you\n\nAnd you're feeling alright\n\nWell, you just roll over\n\nAnd you turn out the light\n\n\n\nYou don't bring me flowers anymore\n\n\n\nIt used to be so natural\n\nTo talk about forever\n\nBut 'used to be's' don't count anymore\n\nThey just lay on the floor\n\n'Til we sweep them away\n\n\n\nAnd baby, I remember\n\nAll the things you taught me\n\nI learned how to laugh\n\nAnd I learned how to cry\n\nWell I learned how to love\n\nEven learned how to lie\n\n\n\nYou'd think I could learn\n\nHow to tell you goodbye\n\n'Cause you don't bring me flowers\n\nAnymore\n\n\n\nWell, you'd think I could learn\n\nHow to tell you goodbye\n\n'Cause you don't bring me flowers\n\nAnymore",
