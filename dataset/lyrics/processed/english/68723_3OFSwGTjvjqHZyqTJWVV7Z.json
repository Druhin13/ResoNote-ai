  "lyrics": "This animal style is like an annual trial\r\nTrying to turn state's evidence with a manual dial, that's hard\r\nNow zoom in and tune in to my frequency\r\nSteppin' to the AM and slam 'em all in secrecy\r\nMy sound waves go deeper than underground caves\r\nPitchin' in Atlanta, you know I'm mowin' down braves\n\nDon't be a hero 'cause yo, that's a sandwich, man\n\nCrazy plans in my land, you'll get banished man\n\nTry me on, impeach\n\nFind me on the beach\n\nGrimy on the speech\n\nJust like an old Spanish man\n\n\"Maricón,\" you can’t be me like a body clone\n\nIn the hoods where I kick it like Karate Tone\n\nThis man spit right in the face of what you transmit\n\nHolding on to relevance, hoping that your hands slip\n\nAnd you fall into obscurity\n\nWalkie talkie antennas with no security, praying mantis\n\nYou really ought to weigh your chances\n\nThis yellow brick road stay stormy like a day in Kansas\n\nAnd then another twister touch\n\nYo, I'm on a roll like I twist the Dutch\n\nI'm on a roll like I twist the Dutch\n\nI'm on a roll\n\nBut I don't smoke though, nah\n\n\n\nWe're all one, just different lumps of protoplasm\n\nEvery moment of joy counts as a bonus 'gasm\n\nEach pore is an ear, from the shore to the skier\n\nThe core of the tear is the doorway to the here and now\n\nWe're an owl\n\nI'm an orphan in Syria, I'm a more fortunate peer\n\nA warm tent appears near the torment and fear\n\nOur origin is clear, we're the source of the seer\n\nI'm a self in sheep's clothing, a wealth of cheap loathing\n\nKnowing nothing full well, compelled to keep going\n\nCome for the wordplay, stay for the high voice\n\nReturn for the rhythms, move in with 'em by choice\n\nIf you didn't like me on other beats, you'll love me on this one\n\nI didn't change anything, repeat yourself, it's fun\n\nKids' friends think I'm deeply flawed\n\nAnd if I fix ten things, ten more will keep me odd\n\n\n\nWe feel conflicting agendas rise and fall\n\nWhat we call our identity tries to synthesize them all\n\nBut there's another option\n\nWise guys and dolls can watch them go by like flies on the wall\n\nThe Cindy mole is wabi sabi\n\nThe indie goal is job as hobby\n\nDon't hyperfocus on your diaper crocus\n\nJust change your drawers and wipe your tochus\n\n\n\nBeliefs are the police of the mind, chiefly designed to relieve us of our fiefdoms of time resigned\n\n“Said no one ever,” said no one ever\n\nEvery text from my father was meant for my brother\n\nI believe that we will win\n\nMe and grief, my evil twin\n\nMy third ventricle got blocked\n\nBut word tentacles could not stop so energy clogged, overheated, and hotboxed\n\nSo I pictured galaxies and reached out to Cathy’s anchor\n\nAnd it yanked me to Earth's surface, thanked her\n\nI'm not doing a Patreon just to find another format for you people to hate me on\n\nI'm from the flirtatious Cretaceous era\n\nBack when we asked girls on dates and faced the terror\n\nBut I'll leave the bitchin' and moanin' to the rich Roman old men\n\nYoung cats make dope raps, don't act like there's a glitch in the moment",
