  "lyrics": "The rose is pruned to a perfect shape\r\nPerfect for whom, I wonder\r\nThe chicken thinks in mysterious ways\r\nBut beauty is not what we're after\r\nNow the chicken imagines a heaven\n\nFull of roosters and plenty of corn\n\nAnd God is a very old rooster\n\nAnd eggs are like Jesus, his son\n\n\n\nEvery day is miracle\n\nEvery day is an unpaid bill\n\nYou've got to sing for your supper\n\nLove one another\n\n\n\nCockroach might eat Mona Lisa\n\nThe pope don't mean shit to a dog\n\nAnd elephants don't read newspapers\n\nAnd the kiss of a chicken is hot\n\n\n\nThe brain of a chicken\n\nAnd the dick of a donkey\n\nA pig in a blanket\n\nAnd that's why you want me\n\n\n\nWhat does it feel like\n\nTo be your tongue\n\nMoving around in your mouth\n\nTo be free in the forest of your love\n\nA cockroach in the cosmos of your house\n\n\n\nEvery day is miracle\n\nEvery day is an unpaid bill\n\nYou've got to sing for your supper\n\nLove one another\n\n\n\nI'm a blond, a brunette and a redhead\n\nI thought up the birds and the bees\n\nMy software is famous all over\n\nMy money is crawling on trees\n\n\n\nThe mind is a soft boiled potato\n\nA jewel in a chocolate shell\n\nI staple my love to your heart dear\n\nWith memories and beautiful smells\n\n\n\nEvery day is miracle\n\nEvery day is an unpaid bill\n\nYou've got to sing for your supper\n\nLove one another\n\n\n\nEvery day is miracle\n\nEvery day is an unpaid bill\n\nYou've got to sing for your supper\n\nLove one another",
