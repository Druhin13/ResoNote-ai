Blige\n\nIt was me in the sky and the stars trying to fight\n\nI just met a bad bitch, but I'm only trying to fuck\n\nI'm a squirrel no lie, I'ma need another nut\n\nRemember on the block, sellin' dope, been blowin' punks\n\nRun up on him click-clack, 12-gauge him in the trunk\n\n\n\nI remember being in the streets trying to take some'n\n\nRide around in the field with a K drum\n\nRide down on a fuck nigga, bake some\n\nNow I hardly ever even see my day ones\n\nI make the [?]\n\nI be floatin' dirty, I don't need no gravity\n\nMake her say \"Uhh\" like Master P\n\nIf you ain't gettin' money it can lead to tragedies\n\n\n\nSosa on the beat",
