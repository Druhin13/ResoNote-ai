  "lyrics": "When I was a child\r\nI thought as a child\r\nI spoke as a child\r\nI didn't know better\r\nBut now I'm a man\r\nI look like a man\n\nI'm old as a man\n\nAnd I should know better\n\nGot my head in the sky\n\nAnd my mind knows what it wants\n\nBut my body just drags me down\n\nAnd my world is something you can't see\n\nBut it's still very real to me\n\nYou can find it in the hole where I keep my soul\n\nThere it is - way down inside me\n\nThere's a real man\n\nForget about my body and be a real man\n\n\n\nI see with my heart\n\nI hear with my heart\n\nI feel with my heart\n\nSometimes it works better\n\nAnd some so-called friends put me down\n\nAnd they pity me for trying\n\nBad emotions push me around\n\nBut the vision shines on and on\n\nIt will shine when we all are gone\n\nAnd I'd like to add a little sparkle while I'm here\n\nLight it up - way down inside me\n\nThere's a real man\n\nForget about bad feelings and be a real man\n\n\n\nSome men's world is only hate and money\n\nAfraid of everything and they laugh at nothing\n\nAnd they only live to criticize\n\nYou can laugh at me now [ha ha ha]\n\nBut the time comes to everybody\n\nWhen you must decide\n\nWhen that day finally comes along\n\nYou might wish you'd been a little more strong\n\nThen you'll wake up in the morning cryin'\n\n\"Oh my God\"\n\nThere it is - way down inside me\n\nIt's a real man\n\nYou got to grow up sometime\n\nBe a real man\n\nSuffer them slings and arrows\n\nBe a real man\n\nNow be a real man\n\nDon't sell yourself for nothing\n\nBe a real man\n\nDon't take no crap from no one\n\nBe a real man\n\nGet your trip together\n\nBe a real man",
