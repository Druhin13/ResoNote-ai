  "lyrics": "I guess being clever's just my safety net\r\nI hide behind my cadence\r\nI hide behind the walls\r\nI built so tall the weakness never spills\n\nI hide all of my burdens\n\nI twist my words so well\n\nI'm breaking but the lie is what I sell\n\n\n\nIf I'm clever you might never understand\n\nI feel like death and me are walking hand in hand\n\nWhen my happiness is hanging by a thread I finally feel content\n\nI guess being being clever's just my safety net\n\n\n\nI'll tell you I feel better\n\nI'll tell you I can sleep\n\nI hope that it can bring a sense of peace\n\n\n\nWhen all the nights are getting darker\n\nThe day becomes so bleak\n\nAnother day I'm conscious is another day I bleed\n\n\n\nIf I'm clever you might never understand\n\nI feel like death and me are walking hand in hand\n\nWhen my happiness is hanging by a thread I finally feel content\n\n\n\nI'm so messed up and inconsistent in my head\n\nI feel my passing only benefits my friends\n\nWhen I know nothing I say matters in the end I finally feel content\n\nI guess being being clever's just my safety net\n\n\n\nI'm out of ways to answer\n\nI'm out of metaphors\n\nI finally got so sick, there is no cure\n\n\n\nI'm out of ways to answer\n\nI'm out of metaphors\n\nI finally got so sick, there is no cure\n\n\n\nIf I'm clever you might never understand\n\nI feel like death and me are walking hand in hand\n\nWhen my happiness is hanging by a thread I finally feel content\n\n\n\nI'm so messed up and inconsistent in my head\n\nI feel my passing only benefits my friends\n\nWhen I know nothing I say matters in the end I finally feel content\n\nI guess being being clever's just my safety net",
