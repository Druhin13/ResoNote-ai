  "lyrics": "I've been waiting for you\r\nTell me that it's over\r\nI've been waiting for you\r\nLooking over my shoulder\r\nAnd I won't waste another night losing sleep\n\nLooking for your headlights, show up back in the drive\n\nI've been waiting for you\n\nTrying to stay sober\n\n\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nI just need some closure\n\nI've been waiting too long for you to come over\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nI just wanna hold you\n\nLeaving the door open if you wanna close it\n\n\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nTell me that it's over\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nTell me that it's over\n\n\n\nFound a book in my room with your pictures and your letters\n\nLittle pieces of you are keeping me together\n\nAnd I tried going out at night to forget\n\nGet lost in the headlights, stumble home every time\n\nWondering if you're still mine\n\nNot just someone to remember\n\n\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nI just need some closure\n\nI've been waiting too long for you to come over\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nI just wanna hold you\n\nLeaving the door open if you wanna close it\n\n\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nTell me that it's over\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nTell me that it's over\n\n\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nI just need some closure\n\nI've been waiting too long for you to come over\n\nAre you getting closer?\n\nI just wanna hold you\n\nLeaving the door open if you wanna close it",
