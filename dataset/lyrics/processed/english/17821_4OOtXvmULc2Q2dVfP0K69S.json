  "lyrics": "I descended from the Mount Sinai\r\nUnleashed the splendour upon a scroundel mob\r\nTo shelter where no messianic light\r\nDrove one single ray into the pulp ov life\r\nO sweet Salome I beckon thee\n\nBring forth thy heinous offering\n\nWithout your love\n\nSo incomplete\n\nCorrupt me with your dignity\n\n\n\nI decompose in rapture ov hells\n\nDissolve divide disintegrate\n\nI am yours\n\nIn euphoria below\n\n\n\nAt faintest whim they would impale the sun\n\nAnd thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man\n\nI am the fly that flew forth from the ark\n\nMy thoughts like insects\n\nWhoring wounds divine\n\nBeen bored with cosmos my dear old foe\n\nThis universe has never been enough\n\nCompelled to liberate the spring ov life\n\nWhen the levee breaks gush forth o' stream ov ice\n\n\n\nI decompose in rapture ov hells\n\nDissolve divide disintegrate\n\nI am yours\n\nIn euphoria below\n\n\n\nI cast my halo from perdition's clay\n\nBehold my bliss profane\n\nBorn ov a lie\n\nCondemned to lurk\n\nLive in denial\n\nYet coiled aflameÂ…\n\n\n\nI am the great rebellion\n\nNeath Milton's tomb I dwell\n\nAn existence even sin would not pardon\n\nNo guilt, no reason, saviour, or shame",
