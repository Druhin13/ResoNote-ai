  "lyrics": "All my life I've played a part\r\nIn the bombs above the ones you love\r\nI'm taking a moment to apologize\r\nI should have done more to stop the war\r\nSo I'm sorry\n\nI leave behind a trail of songs\n\nFrom the darkest gloom to the brightest sun\n\nI've lost my way but it's hard to say\n\nWhat I've been through should matter to you\n\n\n\nA man so drunk he could hardly stand\n\nTold me once holding my hand\n\nSuffering is the same for everyone\n\nHe was right but I was wrong to agree\n\n\n\nAhh, ahh, ahh, ahh\n\nAhh",
