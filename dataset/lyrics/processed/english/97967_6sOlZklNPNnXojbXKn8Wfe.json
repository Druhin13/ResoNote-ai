  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Closer par Mike Perry\r\nWe used to dance to a silent song\nDiamond water shining in the moonlight\nWe were in love back when we were young\nTalking 'bout our dreams, waiting for the sun rise\n\nWe put out cards on the table anywhere that we'd go\nNothing could keep us apart\nCan we go back to that summer when we just had each other?\nI still hear the song in my heart\n\nI'd climb the mountains anytime you need me\nCross the oceans anywhere you go\nAnd I would walk my way across the desert\n\nIf it could just get me closer to you, closer to you\nCloser to you\n\nI'm wide awake in a hotel room\nEmpty bottles laying by the bedside\nI heard you dance to another tune\nI'm drowning on my own and I need your life line\n\nWe put out cards on the table anywhere that we'd go\nNothing could keep up apart\nCan we go back to that summer when we just had each other?\nI still hear the song in my heart\n\nI'd climb the mountains anytime you need me\nCross the oceans anywhere you go\n\nAnd I would walk my way across the desert\nIf it could just get me closer to you, closer to you\n\nI'd climb the mountains anytime you need me\nCross the oceans anywhere you go\nAnd I would walk my way across the desert\nIf it could just get me closer to you, closer to you",
