  "lyrics": "Hip-hop\r\nHip-hop\r\nStruggle-, struggle-, struggle to survive\r\nI had nightmares of Joe Budden arguin' with Lil' Yachty\r\nDivision between artists, party until we sorry that we partin'\n\nThat young man the same age my son is\n\nHe just on fire right now, same way that my gun is\n\nThey this a profession, do amateurs get rejected?\n\nWhen Shady made his hit record, could Canibus accept it?\n\nNah, time just repeatin' itself, '97 just was reckless\n\nNow it's just bigger checks and now it's niggas with dresses\n\nThose who got problems with flows, they can pull up on us\n\nI told Preme we gotta give those \"What In The Fuck\" moments\n\nThis hip-hop, all of the purists be too opinionated\n\nYou like it, you dick-ridin', not a fan of it, then you hatin'\n\nYou gettin' interviewed by Vlad, you either tellin' a story that's incriminatin'\n\nOr Lord Jamar, (what?) discriminatin'\n\nBut white privilege do exist, I agree though\n\nLabels used to tell you what's popular, now it's VEVO\n\nAll they argue 'bout now is who is the hottest Migo\n\nPac and Biggie wasn't just artists, they were our heroes\n\nAs far as years, I've been out here movin' for 10-plus\n\n'Cause I'm about the youth movin', not about \"Them against us\"\n\n\n\nInstead of wantin' to change everything about me\n\nHow come you can't just be the change that you want to see?\n\nYou can question whatever you want but never my hustle\n\nOr my everyday struggle, my everyday struggle\n\nEverybody that's complainin' about it not an OG\n\nIf you ain't droppin' jewels or givin' knowledge to me\n\nHow can I even respect you? Better yet, how can I trust you?\n\nThat's my everyday struggle, my everyday struggle\n\n\n\nHip-hop\n\nHip-hop\n\n\n\nBitches and alcohol, that's my everyday struggle\n\nGettin' rid of packs of raw, that's my everyday struggle\n\n\n\nFresh out the fryin' pan, right into the hands of a billion\n\nBoth my parents in jail and I got grams I could sell ya\n\nWhen I was in boardin' school, I was bored as hell\n\nBut I learned that the key of life for me was to unlock the door to Hell\n\nMy skateboard trail leads to dishonest livin'\n\nDesigner shit I'm just tryna get it, just tryna fit in, uhh\n\nI'm just tryna get it, just tryna fit in",
