  "lyrics": "The midnight bells are ringing\r\nA ship is setting sail\r\nA newborn baby's crying\r\nAs lovers say farewell\r\nI'm singing hallelujah\n\nAmen, the angels say\n\nLet's hope tomorrow finds us\n\nIt's new year's day\n\n\n\nLet's toast to new beginnings\n\nRaise up a glass and say\n\nFor all of our tomorrows\n\nAnd what was yesterday\n\n\n\nI'm singing carpe diem\n\nI'm saying seize the day\n\nCome on, let's live forever\n\nIt's new year's day\n\n\n\nWhere does the time go\n\nJust watch the wind blow\n\nSha la la la\n\nIt's new year's day\n\nGreen does the grass grow\n\nOutside my window\n\nSha la la la\n\nIt's new year's day\n\n\n\nThis message in a bottle\n\nThe wisdom of the wine\n\nIt's just a rainy Monday\n\nThis isn't Auld Lang Syne\n\n\n\nI'm singing hallelujah\n\nAmen, the angels say\n\nLet's pray tomorrow finds us\n\nIt's new year's day",
