  "lyrics": "Most days I wake up with a pit in my chest\r\nThere are thoughts that I can't put to rest\r\nThere's a worry that I can't place\r\nMost nights, I am restless and quiet won't come\r\nSo I lay there and wait for the sun\n\nThere's a trouble that won't show its face\n\n\n\nYou came out of nowhere and you cut through all the noise\n\nI make sense to the madness when I listen to your voice\n\n\n\nDarling, only you can ease my mind\n\nHelp me leave these lonely thoughts behind\n\nWhen they pull me under, and I can feel my sanity start to unwind\n\nDarling, only you can ease my mind\n\n\n\nI'll admit, for a moment I felt so afraid\n\nJust to show you the mess that I made\n\nThere are pieces I usually hide\n\n\n\nBut when you collect me with your steady hand\n\nWith a language that I understand\n\nI feel put back together inside\n\n\n\nYou came out of nowhere and you cut through all the noise\n\nI make sense of the madness when I listen to your voice\n\n\n\nOh Darling, only you can ease my mind\n\nOh help me leave these lonely thoughts behind\n\nWhen they pull me under, and I can feel my sanity start to unwind\n\nDarling, only you can ease my mind\n\nDarling, only you can ease my mind\n\nHelp me leave these lonely thoughts behind\n\nWhen they pull me under, and I can feel my sanity start to unwind\n\nDarling, only you can ease my mind",
