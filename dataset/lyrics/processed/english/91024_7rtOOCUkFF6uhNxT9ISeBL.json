  "lyrics": "Well, there's always been groups of people that never could see eye-to-eye\r\nBut I always thought if they ever had a chance to sit down and talk face to face, they might realize they got a lot in common\r\nWell, I was sitting in a coffee shop, just having a cup to pass the time\r\nSwapping rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend o' mine\r\nWhen some motorcycle riders started snickerin' in the back\n\nAnd started pokin' fun at my friend's hat\n\nOne old boy said, \"Hey Tex, where'd you park your horse?\"\n\nMy friend just pulled his hat down low, but they couldn't be ignored\n\nOne husky fellow said \"I think I'll rip that hat right off your head\"\n\nThat's when my friend turned around, and this is what he said\n\n\n\n\"You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky\n\nAnd rope an old Blue Northern, and milk it 'til it's dry\n\nBulldog the Mississippi, pin its ears down flat\n\nLong before you take this cowboy's hat\"\n\n\n\nNow, partner, this old hat is better left alone\n\nYou see it used to be my daddy's, but last year he passed on\n\nMy nephew skinned the rattler that makes up this old hatband\n\nAnd back in '69 he died in Vietnam\n\nNow, the eagle feather was given to me by an Indian friend of mine\n\nBut somebody ran him down, somewhere around that Arizona line\n\nAnd a real special lady gave me this hat pin\n\nBut I don't know if I'll ever see her again\n\n\n\n\"You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky\n\nAnd rope an old Blue Northern, and milk it 'til it's dry\n\nBulldog the Mississippi, pin its ears down flat\n\nLong before you take this cowboy's hat\"\n\n\n\n\"Now, if that old leather jacket means to you what this hat means to me\n\nWell, I guess we understand each other, and we'll just let it be\n\nBut if you still think it's funny, man, you've got my back up against the wall\n\nAnd if you touch my hat, you're gonna have to fight us all\"\n\nRight then I caught a little sadness in that gang leader's eyes\n\nAnd he turned back to the others and they all just kinda shuffled on outside\n\nBut when my friend turned back toward me, I noticed his old hat brim\n\nIt was turned up in a big old Texas grin\n\n\n\n\"You'll ride a black tornado 'cross the western sky\n\nAnd rope an old Blue Northern, and milk it 'til it's dry\n\nBulldog the Mississippi, pin its ears down flat\n\nLong before you take this cowboy's hat\"",
