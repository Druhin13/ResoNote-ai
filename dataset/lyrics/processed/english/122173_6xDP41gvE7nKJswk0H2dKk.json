  "lyrics": "And in the night\r\nIt was a drunken stutter\r\nStarted as a next to nothing conversation\r\nThen he’s tearing me out\r\nTaking me apart at my friend’s house\r\nI was uncomfortable\n\nI was hurt\n\nStill with blue innocence in his eyes\n\nI felt my reasoning was harsh\n\nWith every stab wound and exhale\n\nI promised myself that I would never lose my youthful fears of grown up men\n\nI’m scarred with cruel intentions\n\nI thought of another the whole time\n\n\n\nRomance is dead and done\n\nAnd it hits between the eyes on this side\n\nThe grass is dead and barren\n\nAnd it hurts between my thighs on this side\n\n\n\nI could begin to open up and risk desire\n\nFor I move slower and\n\nQuieter than most\n\nI grew up too quick and I still forgive too slow\n\nOh I wish there was another way\n\n\n\nRomance is dead and done\n\nAnd it hits between the eyes on this side\n\nThe grass is dead and barren\n\nAnd it hurts between my thighs on this side\n\n\n\nSee me here\n\nMeet me here\n\nI don’t care\n\nIf it’s not repeated\n\nI want to know who you are\n\nFor every second we outrun the moon and dread the sun come up\n\nI want to know who you are\n\nSo I don’t have to check my stuff's still here when you’re gone\n\n\n\nRomance is dead and done\n\nAnd it hits between the eyes on this side\n\nThe grass is dead and barren\n\nAnd it hurts between my thighs on this side\n\n\n\nThis side\n\nThis side",
