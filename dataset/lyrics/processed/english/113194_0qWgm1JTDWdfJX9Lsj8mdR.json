  "lyrics": "I drink and watch the zoo in motion\r\nBeautiful people devoid of emotion\r\nSterilised, pedicured, pedigrees and mankind\r\nThick as fuck and soulless\r\nAnd no longer fear genocide\r\nIt’s gonna end from what I reckon\n\nAs I puke my guts up all over the decking\n\nCos the square reeks of plastic action man\n\nAnd Poundshop Kardashians\n\n\n\nHow am I supposed to change it?\n\nIf I can’t see the wood for the trees?\n\nHow am I supposed to change it?\n\nIf I can’t see the wood for the trees?\n\n\n\nThere’s an orange faced baby at the wheel of the ship\n\nDoing donuts in the carpark\n\nWe watch as it all falls apart\n\nWe idolise idiots\n\nMasturbate to their sex tapes\n\n\n\nWe love them we hate them\n\nWe want to see them fall from Grace\n\nWe laugh at them disheveled\n\nOn the front page of the mail\n\n\n\nThen grab ourselves a pitchfork and go in for the kill\n\nTogether light vigils\n\nEulogise them on the Internet when they top themselves\n\nWhen they couldn’t take it no more\n\n\n\nHow am I supposed to change it?\n\nIf I can’t see the wood for the trees?\n\nHow am I supposed to change it?\n\nIf I can’t see the wood for the trees?\n\n\n\nAnd how are we supposed to change it?\n\nWhen we can’t see the wood for the trees\n\nWhen we can’t see the wood for the trees\n\nIf we can’t see the wood for the trees",
