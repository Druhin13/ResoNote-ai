  "lyrics": "L.A.'s fine, the sun shines most the time\rAnd the feeling is 'lay back'\rPalm trees grow, and rents are low\rBut you know I keep thinkin' about\rMaking my way back\rWell I'm New York City born and raised\rBut nowadays, I'm lost between two shores\rL.A.'s fine, but it ain't home\rNew York's home, but it ain't mine no more\r\"I am,\" I said, to no one there\rAnd no one heard at all\rNot even the chair\r\"I am,\" I cried \"I am,\" said I\rAnd I am lost, and I can't even say why\rLeavin' me lonely still\rDid you ever read about a frog who dreamed of bein' a king\rAnd then became one\rWell except for the names and a few other changes\rIf you talk about me, the story's the same one\rBut I got an emptiness deep inside\rAnd I've tried, but it won't let me go\rAnd I'm not a man who likes to swear\rBut I never cared for the sound of being alone\r\"I am,\" I said to no one there\rAnd no one heard at all\rNot even the chair\r\"I am,\" I cried \"I am,\" said I\rAnd I am lost, and I can't even say why\rLeavin' me lonely still",
