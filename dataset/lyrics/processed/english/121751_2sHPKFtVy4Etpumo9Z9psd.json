  "lyrics": "The secret's in the sunset\r\nThe lies are in the waves\r\nWe ain't seen the worst yet\r\nAnd it's just too late to change\r\nEarly morning blue spins\n\nAlways shaking in my head\n\nTell me who's got the good news\n\nOr is it another lie instead?\n\n\n\nThe secret's in the sunset\n\nBut I get tired of waiting\n\nCause I'm looking all around me\n\nAnd the bullshit keeps on spraying\n\n\n\nTry to seek the truth tellers\n\nThey never stay around\n\nIt's not what they say\n\nIt's how they push you right down in the ground\n\n\n\nThe secret's in the sunset\n\nBut I'm too blind to find it\n\nThey're taping back my eyelids\n\nTo see the silver lining?\n\n\n\nTry to make it through the dawn\n\nDays keep going on and on\n\n\n\nThe secret's in the sunset\n\nThere ain't no rays on me\n\nWe keep living under shadows\n\nThey keep selling us a dream\n\n\n\nWhen it pertains to the second coming\n\nBest refrain from all the running\n\nPut the book up on the shelf\n\nGonna have to save yourself",
