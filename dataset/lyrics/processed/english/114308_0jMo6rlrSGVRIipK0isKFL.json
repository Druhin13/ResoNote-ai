  "lyrics": "Somebody sitting at a bar, getting overload gone wrong\r\nWay out crushing beer cans round a bonfire till dawn\r\nOr driving down a back road with the windows down\r\nAnd getting lost with the one you love to that round here sound\r\nYeah my heart beats to a country song\n\nIt's like they know my story every time it comes on\n\nIf you live it then you know it\n\nIf you know it then you get it\n\nYeah my heart beats, my hearts beats\n\nTo a country song\n\nTo a country song\n\n\n\nHometown girls making homegrown boys, grow up and settle down\n\nChicken fried, strawberry wine, getting that 9 to 5 crown\n\nHard work from a long week, but you came to get loud\n\nYou find out who your friends are when life go south\n\n\n\nYeah my heart beats to a country song\n\nIt's like they know my story every time it comes on\n\nIf you live it then you know it\n\nIf you know it then you get it\n\nYeah my heart beats, my hearts beats\n\nTo a country song\n\nTo a country song\n\n\n\nIt don't matter where you came from, it's about who you are\n\nDon't matter where you end up 'cause it's in your heart\n\n\n\nYeah my heart beats to a country song\n\nIt's like they know my story every time it comes on\n\n\n\nYeah my heart beats to a country song\n\nIt's like they know my story every time it comes on\n\nIf you live it then you know it\n\nIf you know it then you get it\n\nYeah my heart beats, my hearts beats\n\nTo a country song\n\nTo a country song",
