(Some help)\n\nWho do you call when you by yourself? (Yourself)\n\nWho do you call when you feel down low? (Down low)\n\nI just wanna scream, I just wanna explode (Explode)\n\nI, I just wanna let go (Let go)\n\nI just wanna let go (I, yeah)\n\nI just wanna let go (I, yeah)\n\nI just wanna let go (I, I just wanna let go)\n\nI just wanna let go (I, I just wanna let go)",
