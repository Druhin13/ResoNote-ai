  "lyrics": "I know of a tavern not far from here\r\nWhere you can get some mighty fine beer\r\nThe company's true and the wenches are pretty\r\nIt's the greatest damn place in the whole of the city\r\nIf you're looking for crewmates, you'll sure find 'em there\r\nCutthroats and lowlifes and worse i should dare\n\nOl' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn\n\nIt's a den of debauchery violence and sin\n\n\n\nSo come take a drink and drown your sorrows\n\nAnd all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow\n\nWe'll have no regrets and live for the day\n\nIn Nancy's Harbour Cafe\n\n\n\nIf you're looking to go on a glorious quest\n\nThere's a man there who knows of an old treasure chest\n\nFor some pieces of eithe an a tankard of ale\n\nHe'll show you the map and tell you it's tale\n\nAnd then there's Nancy, the lovely barmaiden\n\nShe may be old but her beauty ain't fading\n\nOl' Nancy don't care who comes to her inn\n\nIt's a den of debaucher violence and sin\n\n\n\nSo come take a drink and drown your sorrows\n\nAnd all of our fears will be gone till tomorrow\n\nWe'll have no regrets and live for the day\n\nIn Nancy's Harbour Caf√©",
