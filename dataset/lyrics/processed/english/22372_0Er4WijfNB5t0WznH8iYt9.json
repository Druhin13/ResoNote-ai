  "lyrics": "This is a man's world\r\nThis is a man's world\r\nBut it wouldn't be nothing\r\nNothing without a woman or a girl\r\nYou see man made the cars\n\nTo take us over the road\n\nMan made the train\n\nTo carry the heavy load\n\nMan made the electric light\n\nTo take us out of the dark\n\nMan made the boat for the water\n\nLike Noah made the ark\n\n\n\nThis is a man's world\n\nThis is a man's world\n\nBut it wouldn't be nothing\n\nNothing without a woman or a girl\n\n\n\nMan think about a little bit of baby girls\n\nAnd a baby boys\n\nMan makes them happy\n\nCause man makes them toys\n\nAnd after man make everything everything he can\n\nEven though the man makes money\n\nTo buy from other man\n\n\n\nThis is a man's world\n\nThis is a man's world\n\nBut it wouldn't be nothing\n\nNothing without a woman or a girl\n\n\n\nOh how, how man needs a woman\n\nI sympathize with the man that don't have a woman\n\nHe's lost in the wilderness\n\nHe's lost in bitterness\n\nHe's lost in loneliness",
