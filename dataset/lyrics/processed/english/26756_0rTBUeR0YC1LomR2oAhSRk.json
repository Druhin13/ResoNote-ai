  "lyrics": "Counting down the seconds with the clock on the wall\r\nIt's been the only bit of comfort since you've been gone\r\nEvery second is an hour\r\nEvery half said word is a ghost in the hall\r\nAnd every thought is a wild fire burning me up\r\nOh it's burning up that I can't say\n\n\n\nYou know I still feel the same\n\nBut I get it, I got it, you're gone\n\nWe both know I'm the one to blame\n\nSo I don't blame you for moving on\n\nI can't stand it, I'm such a wreck\n\nI can't stand that you're still in my head\n\nAnd I, you know I still feel the same\n\n\n\nEyes closed, I'm trying not to trace my steps back to your place\n\nI need something new but it's always you\n\n\n\nWhen I think I belong or when I'm moving on\n\nI'm just moving away from myself\n\nAnd I know I can't ask 'cause it's all in the past\n\nBut I wish you'd come back, yeah I wish you'd come back\n\n\n\nWill you sleep alone tonight\n\nWill I even sleep at all\n\nWill you sleep alone tonight\n\n\n\nBut you're moving on\n\nAnd I get it, I got it, I'm gone",
