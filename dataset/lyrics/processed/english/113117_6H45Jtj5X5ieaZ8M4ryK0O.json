  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Overbehind par Flor\r\nBreathe in, it's a lie\nOut of control, it grows wild\nYou get me scared\nYou can't keep down\nLive and learn\nTurn back around\n\nTake it in light, you can keep it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nKeep it in sight, you can leave it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nPlacing it's ghost in your story\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nBut you can't live over your shoulder\nOver behind\n\n\nIt should be easy, still I hide\nI disappoint myself but it's alright\n\nTake it in light, you can keep it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nKeep it in sight, you can leave it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nPlacing it's ghost in your story\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nBut you can't live over your shoulder\nOver behind\n\nOoh, the other side\nI had a dream, what a paradise\nHidden far from my critical light\nIn the dark it'll all feel alright\n\nTake it in light, you can keep it\n\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nKeep it in sight, you can leave it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nPlacing it's ghost in your story\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nBut you can't live over your shoulder\nOver behind\n\nTake it in light, you can keep it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nKeep it in sight, you can leave it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nPlacing it's ghost in your story\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nBut you can't live over your shoulder\nOver behind\n\nTake it in light, you can keep it\n\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nKeep it in sight, you can leave it\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nPlacing it's ghost in your story\nI don't mind, I don't mind\nBut you can't live over your shoulder\nOver behind\n\nYou'll be taking it light\nKeep it in sight\nPlacing it's ghost in\nYou can't live over",
