  "lyrics": "The all lip fountain\r\nAnd the air strip\r\nAnd the bracelets\r\nAnd the children know\r\nNew songs\r\nThat are old songs for us\n\n\n\nYou could see it in the moon\n\nIt was hovering at noon\n\nWith a lick gone bad\n\nWith a good strong laugh\n\n\n\nPhony little path\n\nPhoning for the past\n\n\n\nFucking up your classic\n\n\n\nYou could see it in the moon\n\nDrive by vroom\n\nDrive by vroom\n\nDrive by vroom\n\n\n\nDrive by vroom\n\nIn the light of thee moon\n\nIn an old canoe\n\nWhatâ€™s a girl to do\n\nIn a world like you?\n\n\n\nHolds the clues",
