  "lyrics": "Words and Music by Don Henley and Glenn Frey\r\nIt's another tequila sunrise\r\nStarin' slowly 'cross the sky\r\nI said goodbye\n\nHe was just a hired hand\n\nWorkin' on the dreams he planned to try\n\nThe days go by\n\n\n\nEv'ry night when the sun goes down\n\nHe 's just another lonely boy in town\n\nAnd she's out runnin' round\n\n\n\nShe wasn't just another woman\n\nAnd I couldn't keep from comin' on\n\nIt's been so long\n\n\n\nOh and it's a hollow feelin'\n\nWhen it comes down to dealin' friends\n\nIt never ends\n\n\n\nTake another shot of courage\n\nAnd wonder why the right words never come\n\nYou just get numb\n\n\n\nAnd it's another tequila sunrise\n\nThis old world still looks the same\n\nAnother frame.",
