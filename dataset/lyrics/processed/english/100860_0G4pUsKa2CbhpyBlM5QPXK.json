  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Bye-bye darling par BØRNS\r\nGoodbye to the paperback age\nI’ll miss your touch\nTo flip you, crease you, lay underneath you, fall asleep to\nBye-bye darling I’ll miss you so much\n\nGoodbye to the telephone age\nI’ll miss your voice\nTo listen to, laugh to, talk in the bath to\nBye-bye darling we don’t have a choice\n\nWe had a run good run darling don’t you cry\nI know in the end it’s gonna be just fine\nBye-bye darling\n\nGoodbye to the accident age\n\nI’ll miss the chance\nTo meet you on the street, sweep you off your feet, you know\nBye-bye darling, goodbye in advance\n\nWe had a run good run darling now don’t you cry\nI know in the end it’s gonna be just fine\nIn the end it all feels like a dream\nSomeday we’ll find out what it means\nBye-bye darling\n\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\nGoodbye\n\nAnd every time I think of you I’m so glad\nWhat we had they’ll never know\nEvery summer night we stayed up late\n\nBlowing smoke into figure eights",
