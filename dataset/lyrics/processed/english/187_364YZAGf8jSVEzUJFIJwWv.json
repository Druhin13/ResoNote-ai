  "lyrics": "Here I'll stay, waiting for the tide to turn\r\nAnd sail away, all these breaking waves of hurt\r\nI'll try to leave behind this savage world\r\nMaybe someday I'll return\r\nPatiently, you wait for me on the shore\r\nThinking time is all I need to give you more\n\nBut guarantees, I can't give you no\n\n'Cause I'm a shipwreck sinking slowly\n\n\n\nAnd promises they break\n\nAnd I'm through making mistakes\n\nWell, love's done nothing but cut me up\n\nAnd carry me away\n\n\n\nSo now I hide my heart\n\nIt's buried somewhere deep at the bottom of the ocean\n\n'Cause I've been torn apart\n\nAnd what I thought was love nearly left me broken\n\nSo now I hide my heart\n\nFar beneath the waves at the bottom of the ocean\n\nIf only I could get to you\n\nWhat's swimming beneath the blue of this ocean\n\n\n\nAnd promises they break\n\nAnd I'm through making mistakes\n\nWell, love's done nothing but cut me up\n\nAnd carry me away\n\n\n\nSo now I hide my heart\n\nIt's buried somewhere deep at the bottom of the ocean\n\n'Cause I've been torn apart\n\nAnd what I thought was love nearly left me broken\n\nSo now I hide my heart\n\nFar beneath the waves at the bottom of the ocean\n\nIf only I could get to you\n\nWhat's swimming beneath the blue of this ocean\n\n\n\nAt the bottom of this ocean",
