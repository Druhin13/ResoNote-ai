  "lyrics": "I rarely have a night where my mindâ€™s not running\r\nI'm slipping into cracks falling into big black holes\r\nAnother day alone is another night dreaming\r\nOf breaking off the chain just to break the cycle\r\nOn three, we'll let it go\n\nWe can walk down that line and regain control\n\n\n\nWhy'd you think you know me?\n\nI'm better off alone\n\n\n\nI'm tired of reading words that are void of meaning\n\nWe'd be better off falling into a black hole\n\nIt's the sign of the times when your brain needs fixing\n\nStop living on the edge to escape your shadow\n\n\n\nOn three, could we let it go?\n\nWe can walk down that line and regain control\n\n\n\nWhy'd you think you know me?\n\nI'm better off alone\n\nWhy'd you think you know me?\n\nI'm better off alone\n\n\n\nSo get a grip and dry your eyes\n\nYou're not the only one awake at night\n\nThere are many more with heavy minds I know\n\nBecause you fall apart so easily\n\nBut you're sleeping with the enemy\n\nSo grow a spine and cut your teeth and get gone\n\n\n\nWhy'd you think you know me?\n\nI'm better off alone\n\nI need some time to get it right before I lose it",
