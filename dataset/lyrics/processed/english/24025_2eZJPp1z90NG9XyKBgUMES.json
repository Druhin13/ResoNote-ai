  "lyrics": "Oh these days I'm at a distance\r\nSirens scream but I don't listen\r\nThere's a million distractions I can't escape\r\nLike I'm sleepwalking now but I'm wide awake\r\nAnd the picture I painted I want to change\r\nRight now, right now\n\n\n\nBring me into the conversation\n\nAll my world you can see them shaking, yeah\n\nI'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying\n\nSo bring me into the conversation, oh yeah\n\n\n\nOne by one we're separated\n\nWhat I thought was love just looked like hatred\n\nI've been losing myself trying to prove You wrong\n\nAnd right now all I know is I can't go on\n\nSo I'm stepping across all the lines I've drawn\n\nRight now, right now\n\n\n\nBring me into the conversation\n\nAll my world You can see them shaking, yeah\n\nI'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying\n\nSo bring me into the conversation, oh yeah\n\n\n\nI just want to talk to You\n\nI just want to hear what You're saying\n\nI just want to talk to You\n\nI just want to hear what You're saying\n\nHear what You're saying\n\nHear what You're saying\n\nHear what You're saying\n\n\n\nBring me into the conversation\n\nAll my world You can see them shaking, yeah\n\nI'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying...\n\n\n\nYou're saying\n\nCon-on-on-on-versation, con-on-on-on-versation\n\nI just want to talk to You\n\nI just want to hear what You're saying, oh yeah\n\nI just want to talk to You\n\nI just want to hear what You're saying",
