  "lyrics": "Did you ever find the garden, where the doves go to bathe?\r\nDid you open up your heart there, or were you quiet and afraid?\r\nDid you light up every lantern; your flame whipping against the wind?\r\nOr did you fall back to the alleys, with all your secrets to defend?\r\nBetween the cities and the temple\n\nBetween the jury and the judge\n\nGavel pounds down like thunder\n\nThatâ€™s inside of all of us\n\n\n\nWere we kids out in the desert, or birds running 'cross the sun?\n\nDid I stumble through your darkness, or was I just another one?",
