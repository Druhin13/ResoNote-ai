  "lyrics": "There are thieves outside of our window\r\nThey don't belong, they don't belong\r\nIs there nothing sacred or hallowed\r\nIt's time to move on, we've gotta move on\r\nAnd leave this all behind\n\nCause this house is getting colder\n\nThese shadows will not die\n\nThey're haunting every corner\n\nThe ghost of Shangri La\n\n\n\nThere are visions in every doorway\n\nThey're never gone, they only haunt\n\nWhere these spirits bring only heartache\n\nI try to stay strong, I try to hold on\n\nBut I'm slipping from inside\n\n\n\nAnd these children at my shoulder\n\nThey don't see the tears I cry\n\nStill fighting to get over\n\nThe ghost of Shangri La\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this house is getting colder\n\nThese shadows will not die\n\nThey're haunting every corner\n\nThe ghost of Shangri La\n\n\n\nAnd these children at my shoulder\n\nThey don't see the tears I cry\n\nStill fighting to get over\n\nThe ghost of Shangri La",
