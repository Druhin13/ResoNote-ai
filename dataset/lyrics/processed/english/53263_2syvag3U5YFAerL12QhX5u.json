  "lyrics": "Started a new leaf, when I was Autumn in flood\r\nAnd you say I expected, I expected too much\r\nThere's brittle and broken, there's hollow and false\r\nAnd I never expected to feel so lost\r\nShe breaks like a bottle, thrown drunk to the wall\n\nAnd the tears fall like flowers, from a balcony fall\n\nI tear up my hopes like [?]\n\nAnd I keep going over it, repeat, repeat, repeat\n\n\n\nYou say with me it's been different\n\nYou say that you care\n\nBut you tell me to leave it\n\nJust leave it right there\n\n\n\nYou bled me for ages\n\nYou said it was good\n\nNow you say we should cool down\n\nYou say that we should\n\n\n\nSay it again\n\nSo I know you don't mean it\n\nSay it again\n\nOh it all seems so easy\n\nSay it again\n\nWell I thought you could see me\n\nSay it again\n\nSay it again, again, again, again\n\n\n\nHit me once more, like you really do mean it\n\nSmashed wine glass confetti [? 1:45]\n\nThere's whispers in corners, there's hopeless romance\n\nAnd there's dancing on tables, we live broken and fast\n\n\n\nYou say with me it's been different\n\nYou say that you care\n\nBut you tell me to leave it\n\nJust leave it right there\n\n\n\nYou bled me for ages\n\nYou said it was good\n\nNow you say we should cool down\n\nYou say that we should\n\n\n\nSay it again\n\nSo I know you don't mean it\n\nSay it again\n\nOh it all seems so easy\n\nSay it again\n\nWell I thought you could see me\n\nSay it again\n\nSay it again, again, again, again\n\n\n\nWell don't say that I wasn't good enough\n\nAnd don't play like you aren't madly in love\n\nDon't make believe, like you have even seen the best of me\n\n'Cause I just can't believe, I can't believe\n\n\n\nSay it again\n\nSo I know you don't mean it\n\nSay it again\n\nOh it's all been so easy\n\nSay it again\n\nWell I thought you could see me\n\nSay it again\n\nSay it again, again, again, again\n\n\n\nAgain, again, again, again\n\nAgain\n\nAgain, again, again",
