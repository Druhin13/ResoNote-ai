  "lyrics": "You're a sight for sore eyes\r\nWon't you get on over here?\r\nI'd run and wrap my arms around you\r\nIf I could get out this chair\r\nHell, I can't get out of this chair\n\nTell me son now how's the city?\n\nHow's it all panned out?\n\nYou've been in mine and your daddy's prayers\n\nNever cast one doubt\n\nKnew the day we brought you home\n\nYou were bound to be a star\n\nJust wish you didn't grow so quick\n\nAnd have to live so far\n\n\n\nYou've been gone for way too long\n\nThought you was never gonna come back down\n\nThrow some coffee on the pot\n\nLet's sit and talk about\n\nHow we thought you were never gonna come back down\n\n\n\nThe winds have changed, must be blowing\n\nLook who's back in town\n\nDid you fall down from your thrown\n\nOr did you lose your crown?\n\nAw hell, all's well little brother\n\nLook how much you've grown\n\nSave your tears for a rainy day\n\nOur lost one has come home\n\n\n\nYou built a castle in the sky\n\nThought you was never gonna come back down\n\nRound the boys up to the spot\n\nMaker's all around\n\nHell, we thought you were never gonna come back down\n\n\n\nI've been gone for way too long\n\nThought I was never gonna come back down\n\nIt's good to kick some dirt back up in my stomping grounds\n\nThought I was never gonna come back down\n\nThank God I came back down",
