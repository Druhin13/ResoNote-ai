  "lyrics": "Regrets collect like old friends\r\nHere to relive your darkest moments\r\nI can see no way, I can see no way\r\nAnd all of the ghouls come out to play\r\nAnd every demon wants his pound of flesh\n\nBut I like to keep some things to myself\n\nI like to keep my issues drawn\n\nIt's always darkest before the dawn\n\n\n\nAnd I've been a fool and I've been blind\n\nI can never leave the past behind\n\nI can see no way, I can see no way\n\nI'm always dragging that horse around\n\n\n\nAll of his questions, such a mournful sound\n\nTonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground\n\nSo I like to keep my issues drawn\n\nBut it's always darkest before the dawn\n\n\n\n(Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa)\n\nShake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa\n\nAnd it's hard to dance with a devil on your back\n\nSo shake him off, whoa, whoa\n\n\n\nAnd I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't\n\nSo here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road\n\nAnd I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope\n\nIt's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat 'cause \n\nLooking for heaven, found the devil in me\n\nLooking for heaven, found the devil in me\n\nWell what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me, yeah\n\n\n\n(Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa)\n\nShake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh whoa\n\nAnd it's hard to dance with a devil on your back\n\nSo shake him off, whoa\n\n\n\n(Whoa, whoa...)",
