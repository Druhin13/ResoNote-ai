  "lyrics": "City sidewalks, busy sidewalks\r\nDressed in holiday style\r\nIn the air\r\nThere's a feeling of Christmas\r\nChildren laughing\n\nPeople passing\n\nMeeting smile after smile\n\nAnd on ev'ry street corner you'll hear\n\n\n\nSilver bells, silver bells\n\nIt's Christmas time in the city\n\nRing-a-ling, hear them sing\n\nSoon it will be Christmas day\n\n\n\nYes, I remember\n\nThe silver bells of my youth\n\nFrom the streets of Brooklyn\n\nThey rang up through my window\n\nAnd made me smile\n\n\n\nStrings of street lights\n\nEven stop lights\n\nBlink a bright red and green\n\nAs the mallers rush home\n\nWith their treasures\n\n\n\nHear the snow crunch\n\nSee the kids bunch\n\nThis is Santa's big scene\n\nAnd above all this bustle\n\nYou'll hear Silver bells, silver bells\n\nIt's Christmas time in the city\n\nRing-a-ling, hear them sing\n\nSoon it will be Christmas day\n\nSoon it will be Christmas day",
