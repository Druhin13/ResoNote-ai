  "lyrics": "They never taught us how to love\r\nSo we use our pain to comfort us\r\nAnd we never practice what we preach\r\nInstead we find someone else to teach\r\nWe try not to see with our eyes\r\nAnd fill our plates with dozens of lies\n\nWe try so hard to keep it in\n\nWe turn away from what lies within\n\n\n\nWe are splintered\n\nAnd we are rotten\n\nDeep within the walls that we've forgotten\n\nAll the answers to all our problems\n\nLie within the one who tries to dodge them\n\n\n\nWeâ€™re so afraid to be alone\n\nSo we hoard our pain and call it home\n\nThey never taught us how to look inside\n\nOnly how to run and how to dry our eyes\n\n\n\nWe dig ourselves in too deep\n\nHow many of us die and pretend to live\n\nWe stop the life from leaking in\n\nWhen we turn away from what lies within\n\n\n\nWe are splintered\n\nAnd we are rotten\n\nDeep within the walls that we've forgotten\n\nAll the answers to all our problems\n\nLie within the one who tries to dodge them\n\n\n\nWe are splintered\n\nAnd we are rotten\n\nDeep under the floorboards we've forgotten\n\nBut all the answers to all our problems\n\nLie within the one who tries to dodge them",
