  "lyrics": "Let the new day shine its light on me\r\nShake the old way, nights too dark to see\r\nFree tomorrow, it’s bright with something new\r\nBelieve the righteous, and it will come true\r\nYou’re a child in the garden\n\nYou’re growing up I’ll watch you bloom\n\nAnd your dreams are not forgotten\n\nYou’ll be a woman soon\n\n\n\nLove isn’t greed it’s a need that goes unspoken\n\nLove doesn’t leave when you fade away\n\nPain isn’t vain if it means your heart’s been broken\n\nPain is the same as a means to heal\n\n\n\nLet me try love, you know I’m only one\n\nLive or die love, I tried and to me won\n\nWe’re the future, it’s hard to say we know\n\nAnd the suture is what we have to sew\n\n\n\nYou are a child in the garden\n\nYou’re growing up I’ll watch you bloom\n\nAnd your dreams are not forgotten\n\nYou’ll be a woman soon\n\n\n\nLove isn’t greed it’s a need that goes unspoken\n\nLove doesn’t leave when you fade away\n\nPain isn’t vain if it means your heart’s been broken\n\nPain is the same as means to heal\n\n\n\nLove doesn’t fade away \n\nLove doesn’t fade away",
