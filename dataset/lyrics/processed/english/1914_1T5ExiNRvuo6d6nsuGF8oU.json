  "lyrics": "I been thinking lately about the people I meet\r\nThe carwash on the corner and the hole in the street\r\nThe way my ankles hurt with shoes on my feet\r\nAnd I'm wondering if I'm gonna see tomorrow.\r\nFather forgive us for what we must do\n\nYou forgive us we'll forgive you\n\nWe'll forgive each other till we both turn blue\n\nThen we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven.\n\n\n\nI was in the army but I never dug a trench\n\nI used to bust my knuckles on a monkey wrench\n\nThen I'd go to town and drink and give the girls a pinch\n\nBut I don't think they ever even noticed me.\n\n\n\nFish and whistle, whistle and fish\n\nEat everything that they put on your dish\n\nAnd when we get through we'll make a big wish\n\nThat we never have to do this again again? again????\n\n\n\nOn my very first job I said thank you and please\n\nThey made me scrub a parking lot down on my knees\n\nThen I got fired for being scared of bees\n\nAnd they only give me fifty cents an hour.",
