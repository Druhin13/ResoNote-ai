  "lyrics": "Who reigns in that silence\r\nWhen you sleep in the afternoon\r\nYou reach out to emptiness\r\nUntil the reaching out feels empty too\r\nWe’ll come to my darling, yeah\r\nOr we’ll wake up to someone new\n\nWho makes up the fundamental, the fundamental you\n\n\n\nThis was made for me\n\nThis is make believe\n\nLike slight of hand\n\nAnd a custom vagrancy of mind\n\nWell, I demand it\n\nIt’s just my agency\n\nMy flight of fancy\n\nFlight of fancy\n\nI demand it\n\n\n\nYou reach out to freedom\n\nYou reach out to be consumed\n\nThere’s a part of you starving\n\nThere’s a part of me that over blooms\n\nThe sun stains the ocean\n\nThe pink house returns to gloom\n\nAnd becomes the fundamental\n\nThe elemental hue\n\n\n\nThis was made for me\n\nThis is make believe\n\nLike slight of hand\n\nAnd a custom vagrancy of mind\n\nWell, I demand it\n\nIt’s just my agency\n\nMy flight of fancy\n\nFlight of fancy",
