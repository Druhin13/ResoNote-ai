  "lyrics": "What have I got to do to make you love me?\rWhat have I got to do to make you care?\rWhat have I got to do when lightning strikes me? And I wake to find that your not there?\rWhat have I got to do to make you want me?\rWhat have I got to do to be heard?\rAnd what do I say when it's all over, Babe?\rAnd sorry seems to be the hardest word It's sad, so sad\rIt's a sad situation\rAnd it's getting more and more and more absurd\rIt's sad, so sad\rWhy can't we talk it over, Babe?\rOh it seems to me\rThat sorry seems to be the hardest word It's sad, so sad\rIt's a sad situation\rAnd it's getting more and more and more absurd\rYes, it is\rIt's sad, so sad\rWhy can't we talk it over, Babe?\rOh it seems to me\rThat sorry seems to be the hardest word What have I got to do to make you love me? What have I got to do to make you care?\rYeah, yeah\rAnd what would do I do when lightning strikes me?\rWhat have I got to do?\rWhat have I got to do?\rWhen sorry seems to be the hardest word",
