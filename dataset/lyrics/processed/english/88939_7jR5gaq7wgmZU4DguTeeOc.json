  "lyrics": "Let's watch TV with the sound off\r\n'Cause the news is always bad\r\nLet's be immature and ignorant\r\n'Cause I don't feel like being sad\r\nI wonder if the last generation was better\r\nI wonder if the next one's going to hell\n\nAm I the solution, am I the problem?\n\n'Cause sometimes I can't tell\n\n\n\nI don't know what the point is\n\nJust know I've been disappointed\n\nEach night and every mornin'\n\nAnd I don't wanna play no more\n\n\n\nLet's stay in our pajamas\n\nLet's not leave the house\n\nIt's been real bad lately\n\nBut I feel pretty good right now\n\nWith you laying\n\nWith me on the couch\n\nNobody understands us\n\nAnd I don't understand it\n\nBut stay in our pajamas\n\n\n\nIt's a little overwhelming\n\nWhen you put it in perspective\n\nThat life is just a bunch of memories\n\nThat we've tattered and collected\n\nI wonder if the trees think we're all greedy\n\nIf the air thinks we're all crooks\n\nIf the water thinks we're too needy\n\nIf the sun gives us dirty looks\n\n\n\nI don't know what the point is\n\nJust know I've been disappointed\n\nEach night and every mornin'\n\nAnd I don't wanna play no more\n\n\n\nLet's stay in our pajamas\n\nLet's not leave the house\n\nIt's been real bad lately\n\nBut I feel pretty good right now\n\nWith you laying\n\nWith me on the couch\n\nNobody understands us\n\nAnd I don't understand it\n\nBut stay in our pajamas\n\n\n\nDon't get stressed, don't get dressed\n\nLet's stay in our pajamas\n\nDon't get stressed, don't get dressed\n\nLet's stay in our pajamas\n\nNo worries, no cares, don't go down the stairs\n\nI'm here and I'll hold ya\n\nDon't get stressed, don't get dressed\n\nLet's stay in our pajamas\n\n\n\nLet's stay in our pajamas\n\nLet's not leave the house\n\nIt's been real bad lately\n\nBut I feel pretty good right now\n\nWith you laying\n\nWith me on the couch\n\nNobody understands us\n\nAnd I don't understand it\n\nBut stay in our pajamas",
