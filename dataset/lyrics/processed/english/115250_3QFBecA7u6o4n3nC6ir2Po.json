  "lyrics": "I take one step forward and two steps back\r\nIt's always been like that, it shouldn't be like that\r\nI'm trying to overcome myself\r\nI'm trying to work around this hell\r\nTwo steps forward and three steps back\r\nWhy is life like that? Why am I like that?\n\nI'm trying to understand myself\n\nTrying to fight through this hell\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see this clearly\n\n(See this clearly)\n\nWhy can't I...\n\n\n\nHey hey you, while you're living the dream\n\nIf you've seen what I've seen, nothing is clean\n\nHey hey you, while I'm rolling the dice\n\nI'm paying the price\n\nI've been walking on ice\n\nHey hey you, just get out of my way\n\nAt the end of the day you've got nothing to say\n\nHey hey you, see the look in my eyes\n\nWill the sun ever rise? Will the sun ever rise?\n\n(Will the sun ever rise?)\n\n\n\nAll the days gone by and I can't get 'em back\n\nWhat was my name now? What is my name now?\n\nTrying to rise above myself\n\nTrying to look beyond this hell\n\nSeems like I got way off track\n\nNo one ever found me, no one ever found me\n\nThey wonder why I hate myself\n\nSurrounded by a living hell\n\n\n\nWhy can't I see this clearly\n\n(See this clearly)\n\nWhy can't I...\n\n\n\nHey hey you, while you're living the dream\n\nIf you've seen what I've seen, nothing is clean\n\nHey hey you, while I'm rolling the dice\n\nI'm paying the price\n\nI've been walking on ice\n\nHey hey you, just get out of my way\n\nAt the end of the day you've got nothing to say\n\nHey hey you, see the look in my eyes\n\nWill the sun ever rise? Will the sun ever rise?\n\n\n\n(Will the sun ever rise?)\n\n(Will the sun ever rise?)\n\n(Will the sun ever rise?)\n\n(Will the sun ever rise?)\n\nWill the sun ever rise?!\n\n\n\nHey hey you, while you're living the dream\n\nIf you've seen what I've seen, nothing is clean\n\nHey hey you, while I'm rolling the dice\n\nI'm paying the price\n\nI've been walking on ice\n\nHey hey you, just get out of my way\n\nAt the end of the day you've got nothing to say\n\nHey hey you, see the look in my eyes\n\nWill the sun ever rise? Will the sun ever rise?\n\n\n\nWill the sun ever rise?\n\nWill the sun ever rise?\n\nWill the sun ever rise?",
