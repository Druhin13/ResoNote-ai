  "lyrics": "(Amy Grant, Chris Eaton, Robert Marshall)\r\nWe dim the light\r\nWe stoke the fire\r\nWe breathe the ever-green\r\nYoung ones wait\n\nWhile the old ones make up\n\nTales of how it used to be\n\n\n\nChina dolls, candy corn\n\nPainted wooden toys\n\nTreasures found to the wondrous sound\n\nOf carolling the Savior\n\nBorn to us on Christmas morn\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nEmmanuel, God with us\n\nEmmanuel\n\nEmmanuel, God with us\n\nThe son of Israel\n\n\n\nAnd still he calls through the night\n\nBeyond the days of old\n\nA voice of peace to the weary ones\n\nWho struggle with the human soul\n\n\n\nAll of us travelers\n\nThrough a gvien time\n\nWho can know what tomorrow holds\n\nBut over the horizon\n\nSurely you and I will find\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nAnd the years they come\n\nAnd the years they go\n\nThrough we may forget somehow\n\nThat the child once born in Bethlehem\n\nIs still among us now\n\n\n\n[Chorus]",
