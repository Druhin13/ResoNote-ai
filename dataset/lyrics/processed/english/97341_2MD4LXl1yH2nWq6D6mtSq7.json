  "lyrics": "I know I got an ego\r\nMust be something in my brain\r\nIf I didn’t, I’d probably go insane\r\nI’m sorry I’m an asshole\r\nThat’s just how the raps go\r\nSorry that I do this shit everyday.. Day.. day-da-day-ddddd\n\n\n\nYeah, I’m on my ego death\n\nI had to reassess\n\nI had to resurrect yeah uh\n\nI just wanna be the best\n\nBut I had to reassess\n\nIs that why I’m feeling less?\n\n\n\nMy songs are bipolar like Ye\n\nThey think they controlling my fate\n\nCut all the chatter, no, yall are not rappers\n\nYou just some ad-libbers like Ay huh\n\nI just pulled up, back in black\n\nDrop a hit, they react to that\n\nNow they see this and they acting mad\n\nLike I’m Kanye in a MAGA hat\n\n\n\nI’m so alone, see\n\nI’ve always been one and only\n\nEven back when this gold chain was made out of macaroni\n\nNow they always asking me, what happened to the old me?\n\nI wish I could’ve told him goodbye, wish he could know me\n\n\n\nWish that I could tell you bout how everyone would know you\n\nAnd tell you it’s worth it, despite everything they told you\n\nCrying silent in your pillow saying “I wish I was homeschooled”\n\nToo afraid to sing your songs because you thought that they would roast you\n\n\n\nI was nine\n\nFriends told me I would go lose\n\nNow it’s time\n\nI think I gotta show you\n\nThat’s my mind\n\nSay I don’t care but I so do\n\nHaving trouble walking up a mile in my own shoes\n\nNever used to bet on me and now they like “I owe you,”\n\nLooking back at them like “dafuq? I do not know you”\n\nWhen I make a milly mufucker I’ma show you\n\nFor what I had to go through\n\nIt feel like I’m supposed to\n\n\n\nEgo\n\nI don’t\n\nNeed no\n\nOther people\n\nIn my trio\n\nMyself\n\nI and\n\nMe tho\n\nWe know\n\nWe don’t\n\nNeed no\n\nKilos\n\nMy watch\n\nFrio\n\n\n\nI’m on my ego death\n\nBut I let it breathe again\n\nYeah I let it resurrect\n\nYeah uh\n\nI just wanna be the best\n\nBut I had to reassess\n\nIs that why I’m feeling less? yeah\n\n\n\nOn the way\n\nAll okay\n\nOnly a\n\nCall away\n\nFeeling like a God on my charlamagne\n\nI really think they want my presence like a holiday\n\nBut I think I need to learn when to walk away\n\nMan I got so many problems but I wanna stay\n\nWithout acknowledging how often I have gone astray\n\nFirst step is denial but I’m over that\n\nAnd I’ve accepted it already but it holds me back yeah\n\nBack yeah\n\nSlurring my words I been moving too fast yeah\n\nFast yeah\n\nMaybe I don’t wanna share it like that yeah\n\nThat’s facts yeah\n\nI need to stop checking all of the stats, like that, like that yeah ay\n\n\n\nI’m on my ego death\n\nI had to reassess\n\nI had to resurrect yeah uh\n\nI just wanna be the best\n\nBut I had to reassess\n\nIs that why I’m feeling less?\n\n\n\nI got 40,000 comments this week\n\nAt least 5,000 said that I should kill myself, I’m a freak, I’m too weak\n\nI'm a leach\n\nAnd all my music fucking sucks, I’m a geek\n\nI’m everything they want me to be and that’s the problem with me\n\nSo when they say you got a ego, tell em thank the fucking lord\n\nCause if you didn’t you’d be suffering\n\nYou’d be stuck there on the floor with nothing more\n\nAt least I’m out here smiling in the quicksand\n\nTake your head out of that pillow, one day you gone be the big man\n\n\n\nIn the dark\n\nI look into mirrors for hours\n\nUntil I can’t recognize myself\n\nA dissonant reflection\n\nBoth a sober and a sobering hallucination",
