  "lyrics": "She said\r\nIf you need to find a door inside of your head\r\nThat leads to somewhere else I'll show it to you\r\nShe told us all about Psalm 151\r\nAnd what comes after Hallelujah\n\nShe said\n\nI'll feed you in the morning, eggs on rye bread\n\nBut you're sleeping on the floor\n\nDon't come to my bed\n\nIt's too soon for you to see me\n\nWith my wings spread\n\n\n\nBut I've seen her wet with moonlight\n\nPraying in the street\n\nFeathers at her feet\n\nAnd I saw the small harp hanging\n\nThat she never plays\n\nWaiting for the day\n\nThat it all comes falling down\n\nAnd words fail me now\n\n\n\nSkipped meals\n\nWe'll stay in Kansas city till the wound heals\n\nThe government went bad, we got a raw deal\n\nA transangelic exodus on four wheels\n\n\n\nBut I've seen the broken halo\n\nThat she never wears\n\nHanging by the stairs\n\nAngel, I'll be your guardian if you'll be mine\n\nAuthorities are trailing right behind\n\nI'm not afraid, we read the Psalms at night\n\nClear through Nebraska with just one headlight",
