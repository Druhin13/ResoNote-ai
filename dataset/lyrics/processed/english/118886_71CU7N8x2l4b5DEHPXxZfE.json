  "lyrics": "They pass me by, all of those great romances\r\nIt's as if you're robbing me of my rightful chances\r\nMy picture clear, everything seemed so easy\r\nAnd so I dealt you the blow, one of us had to go\r\nNow it's different, I want you to know...\n\nOne of us is crying, one of us is lying\n\nIn her lonely bed\n\nStaring at the ceiling\n\nWishing she was somewhere else instead\n\n\n\nOne of us is lonely, one of us is only\n\nWaiting for a call\n\nSorry for himself, feeling stupid, feeling small\n\nWishing he had never left at all\n\n\n\nI saw myself as a concealed attraction\n\nI felt you kept me away from the heat and the action\n\nJust like a child, stubborn and misconceiving\n\nThat's how I started the show, one of us had to go\n\n\n\nNow I've changed and I want you to know\n\n\n\nOne of us is crying, one of us is lying\n\nIn her lonely bed\n\nStaring at the ceiling\n\nWishing she was somewhere else instead\n\n\n\nOne of us is lonely, one of us is only\n\nWaiting for a call\n\nSorry for herself, feeling stupid, feeling small\n\nWishing she had never left at all\n\n\n\nNever left at all\n\nStaring at the ceiling\n\nWishing she was somewhere else instead",
