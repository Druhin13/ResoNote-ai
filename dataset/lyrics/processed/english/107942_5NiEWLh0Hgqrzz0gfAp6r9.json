  "lyrics": "You could say I'm in the dumps\r\nIn a F.O.M.O. funk\r\nAll my friends are going out\r\nAnd you know they're getting drunk\r\nI said \"no\" when they asked me if I wanted to come\r\nI'm home alone, but who's having more fun?\n\n(I'll tell you who)\n\n\n\nI could've gone out, I could've left the house\n\nWith my new dope jacket and a grin on my mouth\n\nBut not tonight, no chance, I'd rather stay in the cave\n\n'Cause my energy is low and Postmates' on the way\n\nI seem to always regret going out with my friends\n\n'Cause I love how it starts but I hate how it ends\n\nA night that seems great but I'll probably forget\n\nMight as well just kick it right here in my bed\n\n\n\nAnd then it starts to get late\n\nI think I've made a mistake\n\nDon't really wanna pretend\n\nBut I get that, get that\n\n\n\nFear of missing out, fear of missing out\n\nCancel plans and I'm still dancing\n\nFear of missing out, fear of missing out\n\nTalking F.O.M.O. when I'm all alone\n\n\n\nAlright, so I'm chilling\n\nYou know how I'm feeling\n\nAll my homies getting down and I'm staring at the ceiling\n\nI pull my phone up and I check my friends' stories\n\nEveryone's getting wild while I'm watching Finding Dory\n\nNow, I gotta try to snap back out of it then\n\nBut my Snapchat keeps on pulling me in\n\nAnd the Instagram pics from all of my friends\n\nMake me wanna be out on the opposite end\n\nSo I creep into the kitchen and I pour myself a drink\n\nIt's a one-man party, what would my momma think?\n\nNow, I'm feeling bummed, a little drunk and under the gun\n\nImma pour one more just to make my own fun\n\nUh, me amigos, most loco\n\nI can tell the fuck up 'cause of all the drunk photos\n\nThey might call me Robin 'cause I'm dancing on my own\n\nI'll make every one of my homies wish they all stayed home, damn right\n\n\n\nAnd then it starts to get late\n\nI think I've made a mistake\n\nDon't really wanna pretend\n\nBut I get that, get that\n\n\n\nFear of missing out, fear of missing out\n\nCancel plans and I'm still dancing\n\nFear of missing out, fear of missing out\n\nTalking F.O.M.O. when I'm all alone\n\n\n\nExpensive drinks without the booze\n\nPay the twenty dollar cover, too\n\nI'm having way more fun than you\n\nDancing in my living room\n\nPump it up, break it down\n\nMade it loose, shake it out\n\nI'm having way more fun than you\n\nDancing in my living room\n\n\n\nFear of missing out, fear of missing out\n\nCancel plans and I'm still dancing\n\nFear of missing out, fear of missing out\n\nTalking F.O.M.O. when I'm all alone\n\n\n\nPut your hands in the air with your phones up\n\nYou shouldn't have that F.O.M.O\n\n'Cause you're here listenin' to the beat\n\nCome on, get up off your feet\n\nF.O.M.O., say it with me, F, O, M, O, come on baby",
