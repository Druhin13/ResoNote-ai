B]\nI know you feel where I'm comin from (from)\nRegardless of the things in my past that I've done (done)\n\nMost of it really was for the hell of the fun (the uh)\nOn the carousel, so around I spun (spun)\nWith no directions, just tryna get some (some)\nTryna chase skirts, livin in the summer sun (sun)\nAnd so I lost more than I had ever won (Wha?)\nAnd honestly, I ended up with none (Huh?)\n\n[B. o. B]\nThere's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience\nI'm thinkin, \"Maybe I should get it out\"\nAnd I don't wanna sound redundant\nBut I was wonderin, if there was somethin that you wanna know\n(Somethin that you wanna know)\nBut never mind that, we should let it go (we should let it go)\n'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)\n\nAnd all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go (go!)\nGo (Go!) Go (Heeeeey!)\n\n[Bruno Mars (B.o.B)]\nBeautiful girls, all over the world\nI could be chasin but my time would be wasted\nThey got nothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nottin on you)\nNothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nothin on you)\nThey might say hi, and I might say hey\nBut you shouldn't worry, about what they say\n'Cause they got nothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nothin on you)\nNothin on you, baby\n\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nuttin on you)\nYeaaaaah\n\n[B. o. B]\nHands down, there will never be another one (nope!)\nI been around and I never seen another one (naaaah...)\nBecause your style ain't really got nothin on\nAnd you wild when you ain't got nothin on (Ha ha!)\nBaby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes\nAnd you keep it real while them other stay plastic\nYou're my Wonder Woman call me Mr. Fantastic\nStop... - Now think about it\n\n\n[B. o. B]\nI've been to London, I've been to Paris\nEven way out there to Tokyo\nBack home down in Georgia, to New Orleans\nBut you always steal the show (steal the show)\nAnd just like that girl you got me froze (got me froze)\nLike a Nintendo 64 (sixty-fo')\nIf you never knew, well now you know (know!)\nKnow (Know!) Know (Heeeeey~!)\n\n[Bruno Mars (B.o.B)]\nBeautiful girls, all over the world\nI could be chasin but my time would be wasted\nThey got nothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nottin on you)\n\nNothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nothin on you)\nThey might say hi, and I might say hey\nBut you shouldn't worry, about what they say\n'Cause they got nothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nothin on you)\nNothin on you, baby\n(Nuh-nuh-nuh-nothin on you babe, nuh-nuttin on you)\nYeaaaaah\n\n[B. o.
