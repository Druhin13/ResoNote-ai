  "lyrics": "Better not dare to lie\r\nTo get where you're going, it's a rocky road\r\nWith sunshine and blue skies almost every day\r\nThe way that you're living, there's a price you pay\r\nFall into the ocean while we're searching for the sun\n\nOr walk a million miles just to be the only one\n\n\n\nThat burns our fire, fire below\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\nThat we are higher than every fall\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\n\n\nThe sky's never been so close\n\nWhen life's this good and it's by the coast\n\nAnd higher I take you, hold my hand and we'll float\n\nIf you fall I'll get you, have no worries no more\n\n\n\nFall into the ocean while we're searching for the sun\n\nOr walk a million miles just to be the only one\n\n\n\nThat burns our fire, fire below\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\nThat we are higher than every fall\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\n\n\nFollow me please, I'ma take you higher on the weekend\n\nI'ma take you higher on a weekday\n\nI'ma take you higher on a weekend\n\nI'ma take you higher on a weekday\n\nI'ma take you higher on a weekend\n\nI'ma take you higher on a weekday\n\nI'ma take you higher on a weekend\n\n\n\nThat burns our fire, fire below\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\nThat we are higher than every fall\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\n\n\nThat burns our fire, fire below\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know\n\nThat we are higher than every fall\n\nDon't need a reason for heaven to know",
