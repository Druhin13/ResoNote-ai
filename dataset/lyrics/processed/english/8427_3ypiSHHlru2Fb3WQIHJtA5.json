  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Infinite Mile par King Tuff\r\nMm, talk to me\nLet's take a walk\nGimme some of your sweet time\nBefore all this madness\nI remember your pretty mind\nWe'll listen to each other's words\nAnd make each other smile\nOh, hold me like you used to do\nOn the infinite mile\n\nThen walk into oblivion\nI'll see you in a while\nYeah, I know we'll meet again someday\nOn the infinite mile\n\nI can't help but find it foolish\n\nTo flash away my days\nWith the endless streams of information\nFlying at my face\nA flicker flame and a diamond dance\nThat's my kinda style\nBest to avoid the androids\nOn the infinite mile\n\nSo walk into oblivion\nSee you in a while\nYeah, I'm happy that we found each other\nOn the infinite mile\n\nWe felt the darkness coming\nFrom a million miles away\nWe tried hard to avoid it\nBut it hit us anyway\nOh, when I met you, you were innocent\n\nJust a starry-eyed child\nBefore all that shit went down\nOn the infinite mile\n\nSo walk into oblivion\nFlash me one more smile\nYeah, I know we'll meet again someday\nOn the infinite mile\nSo walk into oblivion\nSee you in a while\nYeah, I'm happy that we found each other\nOn the infinite mile\n\nOn the infinite mile (repeated)",
