  "lyrics": "The strands of memories spread like webs of cold\r\nAlong my skin I feel the frost taking its hold\r\nBurning up, my insides start to freeze\r\nCannibalistic past, thoughts rife with disease\r\nCome and set me free\n\nStand my ground\n\nWon't let the bastards grind me down\n\nI'm bold, I'm strange\n\nWon't let their fears make me afraid\n\nThere's hope, we'll change\n\n\n\nSpiders crawl across my scars at night\n\nPicking at the scabs of regrets in my life\n\nThe darkness whispers madness as she calls my name\n\nMurky faded like a fog of acid rain\n\nWash away the pain\n\n\n\nI'll stand my ground\n\nWon't let the bastards grind me down\n\nI'm bold, I'm strange\n\nWon't let their fears make me afraid\n\nThere's hope, we'll change\n\n\n\nThe pain goes on and on\n\nUnder a crushing weight\n\nSwearing and paralyzed\n\nUpon the bed of my own hate\n\nThe night is never ending\n\nAs I struggle for control\n\nWhere will I find the peace of sleep inside this hole?\n\n\n\nI'll stand my ground\n\nWon't let the bastards grind me down\n\nI'm bold, I'm strange\n\nWon't let their fears make me afraid\n\nThere's hope, we'll change",
