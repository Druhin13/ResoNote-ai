Here comes Jumbo with a knife and a tan\n\nAnd an elephant’s tail for his Instagram\n\nGrown up brave on the fat of the land of the free\n\n\n\nSee the twinkle in his eye like a torch in the dark\n\nOn a court-approved stroll through the city park\n\nWhistling which of you purebreds gonna bark at my theme song goes a little something like:\n\n\n\nHere comes Jumbo\n\nAmerican as gumbo\n\nSkin white as new corn liquor hair black as molasses rum, though\n\nHe ain’t dumb, no\n\nYou elitist bums, go\n\nGet yourselves off of Capitol Hill\n\n‘Cause we’ve just about had our fill\n\nOf y’all playing Columbo\n\n\n\nWhen anyone can tell\n\nThat good old Jumbo\n\nWas only to trying to help\n\nOnly trying to help\n\nOh, help us out with one now Jumbo\n\n\n\nHere comes Jumbo\n\nAmerican as gumbo\n\nWashed in the blood of the little man singing fee fi fo fum, bro\n\n‘Til his kingdom comes so\n\nYou elitist bums can go\n\nFuck yourselves off of Capitol Hill\n\n‘Cause we’ve just about had our fill\n\nOf wondering what is and isn’t rigged\n\nWhen there’s all these unadopted kids\n\nReady to swim across the Bering Sea\n\nTo feast on the fat of the land of the free\n\nThey’re twiddling their thumbs though\n\nWhile y’all play Columbo\n\nWith poor old Jumbo",
