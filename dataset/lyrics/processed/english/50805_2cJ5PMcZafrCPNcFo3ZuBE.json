  "lyrics": "Well I used to have friends in this town, but they’re gone now\r\nI used to know the words to this song, but they’re gone\r\nHow could we have strayed?\r\nHow could we have strayed?\r\nYeah I used to have friends in this town, but they’re gone now\n\n\n\nWell I started my life in this town, but it’s gone now\n\nThe white picket fence and the lawn, yeah they’re gone\n\nTell me what remains\n\nTell me what remains\n\n\n\nYeah I used to have friends in this town, but they’re gone now\n\n\n\nToss me through the waterfall\n\nPush me in the lake\n\nThey can give you the world\n\nYeah but they take, they take, they take\n\nOh\n\n\n\nI made my way through this town til they tore down\n\nI had the sun at the dawn, but they’re gone\n\nWhat could we have saved?\n\nWhat could we have saved?\n\n\n\nYeah I used to have friends in this town, but they’re gone now\n\n\n\nToss me through the waterfall\n\nPush me in the lake\n\nThey can give you the world\n\nYeah but they take, they take, they take\n\n\n\nWhen you fight so hard just to give them back\n\nAll the lives you let them once attack\n\nBut we never saw the change\n\nWe made the path we made\n\nThe only game we played\n\nSo how could we have strayed?\n\nOh\n\n\n\nToss me through the waterfall\n\nPush me in the lake\n\nThey can sell you the world\n\nYeah but you pay, you pay, you pay\n\n\n\nI used to have friends in this town, but they’re gone now\n\nI used to know words to this song, but they’re gone\n\nTell me what remains",
