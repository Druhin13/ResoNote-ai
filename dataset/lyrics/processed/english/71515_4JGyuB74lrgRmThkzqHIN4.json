  "lyrics": "Wake up and see the diamonds floating by. They silently glitter, like angels; fly so high. You reach to kiss them, but you can’t stand the pain. The sweet smell slowly kills you; washed away in the driving rain. Where did you go, my old friend? Did you finally find the sun through the rain? Where did you go, my old friend? Did you finally laugh at the pain? Sculptures turn from stone to mud, as you shared all your wisdom with a snap of your glove. The silver tells a story of so very long ago, but the story begins now that you’ve grown old. Where did you go, my old friend? Did you finally find the sun through the rain? Where did you go, my old friend? Did you finally laugh at the pain? Where did you go, my old friend? Where did you go, my old friend?",
