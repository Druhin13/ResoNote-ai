To the races, got my love jumpstarted\n\nThe only one I want is you\n\n(Say it again, hey!)\n\nI hear the bells, and they're ringing already\n\nFour kids and a big ol' wedding, singing \"You\"\n\n(Say it again, hey!)\n\nNow as I make the long walk home\n\nYou got me feeling like an overdose, singing (You)\n\n\n\nHey, don't act surprised\n\nA goldfish wouldn't love you twice\n\nAnd your gravity, my depravity won't take my advice (So nice)\n\nI never run while I still\n\n\n\n(Can) To the races, got my love jumpstarted\n\nThe only one I want is you (Hey!)\n\nI hear the bells, and they're ringing already\n\nFour kids and a big ol' wedding, singing \"You\"\n\n(Say it again, hey!)\n\nNow as I make the long walk home\n\nYou got me feeling like an overdose, singing (You)\n\n(Well now)\n\n\n\nThen my heart starts attacking and the arteries clapping\n\nTrapping all of-, it's a poison in the morning\n\nI was sure that she was slipping me\n\nGoddamn, maybe\n\n\n\nWhat goes up must come down\n\nTake my advice and run while you still\n\n\n\nOff to the races, got my love jumpstarted\n\nThe only one I want is you\n\n(Say it again, hey!)\n\nI hear the bells, and they're ringing already\n\nFour kids and a big ol' wedding, singing \"You\"\n\n(Say it again, hey!)\n\nNow as I make the long walk home\n\nYou got me feeling like an overdose, singing (You)\n\n(Well now)\n\n\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price\n\n(Money, money, money, money)\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price\n\n(Money, money, money, money)\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price\n\n(Money, money, money, money)\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price\n\n(Money, money, money, money)\n\n\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price\n\nI feel broken, but maybe I just gotta pay the price (Ooh)\n\nI keep hoping that maybe I just gotta pay the price\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price, oh\n\n(Maybe I just gotta pay the price\n\nMaybe I just gotta pay the price)\n\nWhat goes up must come down\n\nTake my advice and run while you still",
