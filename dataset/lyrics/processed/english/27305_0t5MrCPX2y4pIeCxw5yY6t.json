  "lyrics": "Feels like we're floating\r\nSail boating\r\nAnd now the stars are glowing\r\nWe're only knowing\r\nThis is just space town\r\nSoon we gotta come down\n\n\n\nWe ain't never felt this way, no gravity\n\nJust a weightless sway\n\nFeels like the love we make\n\nOut on this cosmic lake\n\nWell this is just a space town\n\nSoon we gotta come down",
