  "lyrics": "When your body is coming apart at the seams\r\nAnd the whole thing's feeling low\r\nYou're convincing yourself\r\nThat there's nobody there, I know\r\nI know how you feel\n\nLike somebody has taken the wheels off your car\n\nWhen you had somewhere to go\n\nWell, it's annoying\n\nNot going to get very far, I know\n\nBut somebody cares\n\n\n\nThere's always someone, somewhere, you should know by now\n\nAlways somebody who cares\n\nIt's happening day in, day out\n\nWell, you know by now\n\nAlways somebody who cares\n\n\n\nAnd if you don't know it, how will it find you?\n\nHow will we know your whereabouts?\n\nBut I know how you feel\n\n\n\nI know how you feel\n\n\n\nLike somebody has taken the wheels off your car\n\nWhen you had somewhere to go\n\nWell, it's frustrating\n\nNot going to get very far, I know\n\nBut somebody cares\n\n\n\nThere's always someone, somewhere, you should know by now\n\nAlways somebody who cares\n\nIt's happening day in, day out\n\nWell, you know by now\n\nAlways somebody who cares\n\n\n\nAnd if you don't know it, how will it find you?\n\nHow will we know your whereabouts?\n\nBut I know how you feel",
