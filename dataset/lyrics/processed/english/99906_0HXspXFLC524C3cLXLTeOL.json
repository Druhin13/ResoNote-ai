Don't make us take y'all wrists\n\nRapper's food, I tell my niggas, \"Go head, take y'all pick\"\n\nNot in the mood, but if it's women, go head, take y'all pick\n\nGet rich and it's legal, think 'bout what we can make off hits\n\nNot leavin' me off Bad and Boujiee, I'm on Takeoff's shit\n\nWon't pay no attention, they breath stinkin', they just talk shit\n\nEven shoot a rapper now, we 'bout to get more rich\n\nI miss the flaggin' with my fashion, now I see more crips\n\nThese pull-ups got my back sore, wake up and hit more dips\n\nDs constantly askin' questions, but we ain't saw shit\n\nCaught him up town, 7th or 8th, 145th\n\n[?]\n\nYou dyin' you move one more inch\n\nThe Henny got him, he throwin' up, he take one more sip\n\nHit one more lick, they owe us, let's take one more trip\n\nI be goin' hard, I need a day to rest\n\nScooped yo' bitch up by the bar, we 'bout to make a mess\n\nForeign car in traffic, you blink, I made a left\n\nI let off all of these ratchets 'til ain't a hater left\n\nGot so much love for the ghetto, some nights it made me stressed\n\nIf school was the streets, these niggas be scared to take a test\n\nBust down the Patek Philippe and I want the AP next\n\nIn the trap, I dealt with straight cash, now I taking cheques (count it out)\n\nI be goin' hard, I need a day to rest (I'm going hard)\n\nScooped yo' bitch up by the bar, we 'bout make a mess\n\nForeign car in traffic, you blink, I made a left\n\nI let off all these ratchets 'til ain't a haters left\n\nGot too much love for the ghetto, some nights it made me stress\n\nIf school was the streets, these niggas be scared to take a test\n\nBust down the Patek Philippe and I want the AP next\n\nI know it's killing them to show love, these niggas hate a threat",
