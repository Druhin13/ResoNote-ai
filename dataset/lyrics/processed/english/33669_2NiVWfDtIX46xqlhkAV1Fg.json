  "lyrics": "Travelers on an unending voyage of discovery\r\nA voyage fueled by desire to know our true calling\r\nSeeking for timeless wisdom beneath the ever changing depths of heaven\r\nTrapped in confusion\r\nArmed with melodies to strike our emotions\r\nWaging the war within\n\nUntil one day \n\nSooner or later we see\n\nThis music is our destiny\n\n\n\nSooner or later we see\n\nThis music is our destiny\n\n\n\nAs we walk through the valley in the shadow of death\n\nThy shall fear no evil \n\nHeadhunterz are back\n\n\n\nSooner or later we see\n\nThis music is our destiny\n\n\n\nDestiny",
