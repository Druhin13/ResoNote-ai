  "lyrics": "Look into the eyes of a child, it's magic\r\nOnce in a while\r\nYou don't know what to say\r\nYou throw it all away\r\nHold onto your dreams, you can find them\n\nTake a look around\n\nRemember who you are\n\nYou don't have to look that far\n\n\n\nI'd given up on happy endings\n\nYou know that it won't last\n\nDon't look back\n\nDon't look back\n\n\n\nReach into your soul, it's amazing\n\nOpen up your eyes\n\nAnd face another day\n\nAnd find a better way\n\n\n\nHang onto your heart, it's surprising\n\nIt's easy to believe\n\nYou can lose it in the end\n\nAnd find it all again\n\n\n\nI'm turning nightmares into dreams\n\nAnd the fear is fading fast\n\nDon't look back\n\nDon't look back\n\n\n\nHow can I go on pretending\n\nLiving in the past\n\n\n\nDon't look back\n\nDon't look back\n\n\n\nDon't look back\n\nDon't look back\n\n\n\nDon't look back\n\n\n\nHow can I go on pretending\n\nI'd given up on happy endings\n\n\n\nEven though your heart is breaking\n\nLove is there - it's for the taking\n\n\n\nHow can I go on pretending\n\nI'd given up on happy endings\n\n\n\nEven though your heart is breaking\n\nLove is there - it's for the taking",
