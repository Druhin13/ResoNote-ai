  "lyrics": "I feel like I'm losing you whenever I'm offline\r\nNo one ever had you; I used to pretend that you're mine\r\nI feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try\r\nI feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try\r\nBruising my finger hitting your line\r\nIf I'm holding back, I might just lose my mind (So alone)\n\n\n\nKeeping my phone alive (Alive)\n\nHoping that you call this time (Oh, I)\n\nThought I heard your ringing (You)\n\nYou know I hear things sometimes\n\nCall my line, call my line\n\nCome alive, come alive\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\n\n\nKeepin' you on my radar\n\nLately, you're so damn cold\n\nYou used to hold me down\n\nYou're far, so it's been a while\n\nI still remember your voice\n\nHow you talk so soft in the morning\n\nYou're the only one I'm wanting\n\nLove stays still and I'm frozen\n\nBut I'm opening thoughts that I keep within\n\nI guess I gotta be a man\n\nI tried as hard as I can\n\n\n\nKeeping my phone alive (You)\n\nHoping that you call this time\n\nThought I heard you ringin'\n\nYou know I hear things sometimes\n\nCall my line, call my line\n\nCome alive, come alive\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\nShow me, don't pretend\n\nShow me, don't pretend (Come alive, oh yeah)\n\nShow me, don't pretend (Yeah, yeah)\n\nShow me, don't pretend",
