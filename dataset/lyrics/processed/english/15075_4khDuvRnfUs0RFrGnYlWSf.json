I'm finally remembering\r\nI'll pour another drink, on our anniversary\r\nBut not for us; for me. I'm finally forgetting\r\nIt's done, we're over baby\r\nI'll tell you when, I'll tell you how\r\nYou got so distant lately\r\nThe little things led us to now\r\nGo get that new Mercedes\r\n'Cause it ain't me you care about\r\nGive me distance baby\r\nYou've been so distant lately\r\nLately, lately\r\nYou've been so distant lately\r\nLately, lately\r\nYou've been so distant\r\n(Scream) Don't matter now!\r\n\"I want that new Mercedes\"\r\nNo other words come out your mouth\r\nYou've been so distant lately\r\nYou've been so distant lately\r\n\"I want that new Mercedes\"\r\nNo other words come out your mouth\r\nYou've been so distant lately\r\nYou've been so distant lately",
