  "lyrics": "Children so traumatized in the first years of life that they do not bond with other people. They are children who cannot love or accept love. Who could hurt or even kill without remorse. Could a great deal of this be demons?\r\nWe both know that there's a season\r\nA time and place to believe in\r\nThe stranger's gonna come and we both need it\r\nTo give this up right now\n\n\n\nAnd there's no easy way to say that we both changed\n\nThe life we knew, well it won't ever be the same\n\n\n\nI'm just holding on to my better demons\n\nAnd I really need them not to fail me now\n\nI speak in tongues but I can never free them\n\nAnd my spirit weakens but I won't back down\n\n\n\nNo holy ghost, no holy spirit\n\nI'm on my own right now\n\nDo the angels sing if you can't hear them?\n\nCause I don't hear a sound\n\n\n\nAnd there's no easy way to tell you that I'm gone\n\n\n\nI'm just holding on to my better demons\n\nAnd I really need them not to fail me now\n\nI speak in tongues but I can never free them\n\nAnd my spirit weakens but I won't back down\n\n\n\nLeave me [?] on the clouds you wake\n\nOn my own I'll face down all my enemies\n\n\n\nI'm just holding on to my better demons\n\nAnd I really need them not to fail me now\n\nI speak in tongues but I can never free them\n\nAnd my spirit weakens but I won't back down\n\n\n\nIn your nightmare what happens?\n\nI get really scared\n\nWhere are you in the nightmare? What happens in the dream?\n\nI'm in my house upstairs\n\nAnd then what happens next?\n\nAnd then he comes upstairs and, um, hurts",
