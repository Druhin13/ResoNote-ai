  "lyrics": "We're in the ruins of dreams\r\nVultures and their dead end screams\r\nThe fragile sanctuary of home\r\nSpit me out, find another clone\r\nNeed a revolution\r\nTo find the lost evolution\n\nWaiting for the wind to turn\n\nAvoiding truth and never learn\n\nNever learn, never learn, never learn\n\n\n\nSo burn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes\n\nLet the flames be seen far and wide\n\nBurn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes\n\n\n\nDrop the bombs, build the new\n\nPurge our thoughts for different views\n\nDifferent mantra, different beat\n\nStill heading for eternal sleep\n\nDevoured by constant pressure\n\nAlways for someone elseâ€™s pleasure\n\nNot sure what you see in the scope\n\nAfraid we're running out of hope\n\nOut of hope, out of hope, out of hope\n\n\n\nSo burn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes\n\nLet the flames be seen far and wide\n\nBurn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes\n\n\n\nIn the name of a broken spirit\n\nFight the boundaries and kill it\n\nTrapped inside the villain of man\n\nApathy, the sickness in our lifespan\n\n\n\nSo burn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes\n\nLet the flames be seen far and wide\n\nBurn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nSo burn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes\n\nLet the flames be seen far and wide\n\nBurn, burn, burn\n\nThe world needs to see\n\nWith open eyes",
