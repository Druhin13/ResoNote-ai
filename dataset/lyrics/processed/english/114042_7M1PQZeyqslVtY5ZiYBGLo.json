  "lyrics": "I could pull in, kill the lights in your driveway\r\nWalk you to your door and kiss you in the porch light like a gentleman\r\nOr we could chase a little magic before the sun comes up\r\nOh girl, there ain't no reason we gotta rush\r\nLet's make this night move a little bit\n\nSlower girl, then take another lap around this old town\n\nAnd let the radio take us where we wanna go\n\nGet a little closer on the side of the road\n\nSomewhere where we know nobody's watchin'\n\nGet this world revolvin' a little bit slower\n\nA little bit slower\n\n\n\nI wanna see you laugh like that in the moonlight\n\nLet you call every shot in the dark like a gentleman\n\nI love it, what you do to me so let it linger on\n\nLet your kiss fall a little bit\n\n\n\nSlower girl, then take another lap around this old town\n\nAnd let the radio take us where we wanna go\n\nGet a little closer on the side of the road\n\nSomewhere where we know nobody's watchin'\n\nGet this world revolvin' a little bit slower\n\nA little bit slower\n\n\n\nA little bit longer, laid back play you a song, yeah\n\nMakin' time freeze, make it all last\n\nHoldin' onto every drop this moment's got\n\n\n\nSo let's make this night move a little bit\n\nMake this night move a little bit\n\n\n\nSlower girl, then take another lap around this old town\n\nAnd let the radio take us where we wanna go\n\nGet a little closer on the side of the road\n\nSomewhere where we know nobody's watchin'\n\nGet this world revolvin' a little bit slower\n\n\n\nA little bit slower\n\nA little bit slower\n\n(Slower girl, then take another lap around this old town)\n\nA little bit slower\n\n(And let the radio take us where we wanna go)\n\nA little bit slower",
