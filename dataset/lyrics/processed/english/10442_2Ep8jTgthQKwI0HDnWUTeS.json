  "lyrics": "Dude, the hardest part is like, yo, like\r\nRight now in my life this is what I need\r\nAnd this is what will make me happy, right?\r\nAnd I understand that you have your needs\r\nAnd you have things that are gonna make you happy, right?\r\nSo if we can come together and we can talk about what we need\n\nAs individual human beings and then come together and be\n\nSupportive of each others growth, be that home for each other\n\nLike that's... that's great\n\nBut you know the hard part is that transitional period between\n\nTrying to live up to the expectations of who a person wants you to be, or who...\n\nWho you want yourself to be to that person, you know?\n\nIt's like, okay, that's a lot of weight to carry, you know?\n\nYou have to, at some point, have these really brutally honest conversations that, you know...\n\nEither free you both and allow you to grow the way you need to grow or deepens the connection between the both of you",
