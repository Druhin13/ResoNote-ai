You have a sister now\n\n(Nothing happens)\n\nAnd as you go on and shit gets hard, don't worry about me\n\n\n\nDo not wait, do not wait, do not wait\n\nI'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there\n\n(You're ready and you know it)\n\nDo not wait, do not wait, do not wait\n\nI'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there\n\n(Something you'll always remember)\n\nDo not wait, do not wait, do not wait\n\nI'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there\n\n(Your parents will end up where they belong)\n\nDo not wait, do not wait, do not wait\n\nI'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there\n\n(Never hurt you to talk to them, though)\n\nDo not wait, do not wait, do not wait\n\n(And guess what? She's obsessed with you)\n\nI'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there\n\n(When shit gets hard, don't worry about me)\n\nOh\n\nOh\n\nOh",
