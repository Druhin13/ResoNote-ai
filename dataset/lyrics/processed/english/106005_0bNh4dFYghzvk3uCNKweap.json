  "lyrics": "You hold me down right, on time, over my life\r\nYou showed up, and showed me so wrong, you were right\r\nI’m alone in this ocean, floating in the moonlight\r\nThat I’m with the notion it’s me, myself, and I\r\nI love the fear, fast car crash, Mulholland Drive\n\nOpen the flood gates, this love-hate is making me cry\n\nBut tears fill the tub with the blood from your wrist that night\n\n\n\nIf we should live forever\n\nLet’s sleep\n\nWhen we can lame together\n\nAll old and vile\n\nNow we should try to severe\n\nAll our bad ties\n\nSo it’s me and you\n\nAnd the skies are blues\n\nBoth bleeding from our eyes\n\n\n\nSkies of\n\nLooking from our eyes\n\n\n\nI was a love-sick, dumb bait, tip off the stock\n\nGive me shove, when you push it like it’s keys in his car\n\nI feel like an animal that’s been kicked around too long\n\nIn me, utero, there’s electric circuitry that’s been wired all wrong\n\n\n\nIf we should live forever\n\nLet’s sleep\n\nWhen we get lame together\n\nAll old and vile\n\nNow we should try to severe\n\nAll our bad ties\n\nSo it’s me and you\n\nAnd the skies are blues\n\nBoth bleeding from our eyes\n\n\n\nNow where the hell have you\n\nGone on your way to\n\nSome shill you call home (so miserable)\n\nSo me I won’t survive\n\nSomehow, I’m scraping by\n\nWe’re accused to living\n\nRubble, blackened bones\n\n\n\nIf we should live forever\n\nLet’s sleep\n\nWhen we get lame together\n\nAll old and vile\n\nNow we should try to severe\n\nAll our bad ties\n\nSo it’s me and you\n\nAnd the skies are blues\n\nBoth bleeding from our eyes\n\n\n\nWe’re bleeding from our eyes\n\nWe’re bleeding from our eyes\n\nWe’re bleeding from our eyes\n\nWe’re bleeding from our eyes",
