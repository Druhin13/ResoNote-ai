  "lyrics": "Oh, heavy petals free your head\r\nLegions of pasture call from the bed\r\nOh, heavy petals just like me \nTenderest rage that no one can see\r\nStep on the gas to go nowhere\n\nBelieve me when I say I love you bare\n\nFear, fear not falling into space\n\nGround control is not your dwelling place\n\n\n\nPainted winds will come and we will fall\n\nThrough sunlight unserious we’ll call\n\n\n\nPainted winds will come and we will fall\n\nThrough sunlight unserious we’ll call\n\n\n\nOh, heavy petals just like me\n\nTenderest rage that no one can see",
