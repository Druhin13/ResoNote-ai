  "lyrics": "Laid on a heartache on me\r\nWhat would I do without the way that you have?\r\nFuneral singers waiting\r\nCharity fails the child that you have\r\nLighthouse keep a brazen built\n\nSpread like a fog, certain weather\n\nPray for a push but it doesn't take the jump again tonight\n\n\n\nThe book is aching for the tree\n\nReturn, return, return to me\n\nAll my friends, all my friends\n\nAll my friends are weeds and rain\n\nAll my friends are half gone birds\n\nAll magnets, all my friends are words\n\nAll my friends, all my friends are\n\nFuneral singers, funeral singers\n\nWait, wait\n\n\n\nThe spark is aching for the light\n\nReturn, return, return tonight\n\nAll my friends, all my friends\n\nAll my friends are keeping time\n\nAll my friends have just quit trying\n\nAll my friends, all my friends are\n\nFuneral singers, funeral singers\n\nFuneral singers\n\nWait, wait",
