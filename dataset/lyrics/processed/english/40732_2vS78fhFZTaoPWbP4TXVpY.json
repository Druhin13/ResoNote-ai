  "lyrics": "Take him out back\r\nTake him out back\r\nTake him out back\r\nI'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this\r\nThese hands, this mind, this instability\n\nFrom a cage I created, to a hell that heaven made\n\nCan't let go of the hatred, cause I love the way it tastes\n\n\n\nTake him out back\n\n\n\nI wouldn't take back a moment\n\nNot one miserable moment\n\nI'll give it all, 'til there's nothing\n\nI'd walk into the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nI'd walk into the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\n\n\nI've come to terms with the fact I'll never change\n\nAnd that's just fine, I find solace in the pain\n\nI don't mind the darkness, it's easy on the eyes\n\nI'm praying for something to make me feel alive\n\n\n\nI wouldn't take back a moment\n\nNot one miserable moment\n\nI'll give it all, 'til there's nothing\n\nI'd walk into the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nI'd walk into the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\n\n\nI'm a paranoid, sycophant, masochistic dilettante...\n\nNarcissistic elephant in the room\n\nI'm the end of the world\n\nThinning the herd\n\nThe all around outta my mind, fucking absurd\n\nI am gone, I am gone\n\n\n\nI wouldn't take back a moment\n\nI'd walk into the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nI'd walk into the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nInto the fire\n\nFire\n\n\n\nTake him out back",
