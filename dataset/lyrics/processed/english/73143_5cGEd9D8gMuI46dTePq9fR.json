  "lyrics": "If he brings you happiness, then I wish you all the best\rIt's your happiness that matters most of all\rBut if he ever breaks your heart, if the teardrops ever start\rI'll be there before the next teardrop falls.\r'Though it hurts to let you go, darling I want you to know\rThat I'll stand by you if ever you should call And if I should ever hear that he made you shed a tear\rI'll be there before the next teardrop falls.\rI'll be there any time you need me by your side\rTo dry away ev'ry teardrop that you cried\rIf he ever leaves you blue just remember I love you\rI'll be there before the next teardrop falls",
