  "lyrics": "Sixteen, set of keys\r\nPick her up in your hand-me-down Chevy\r\nHold the door, beeping light\r\nKeep talking 'bout how she looks pretty\r\nSpend your money like you got some\r\nEven though you ain't got enough\n\n'Cause if you play your cards just right\n\n\n\nYou'll be kissing a girl tonight\n\nTime will slow down, heart will beat faster\n\nIn that moment, nothing else matters\n\nYou'll see forever when you close your eyes\n\nAnd you're kissing a girl tonight\n\nHolding your breath, holding up close\n\nI don't want it to end, and then it's over\n\nAnd you're counting down the hours till the next time\n\nYou're kissing a girl goodnight\n\nKissing a girl goodnight\n\n\n\nTwenty-three, set of keys\n\nOne bed, one bath, but it's a mansion\n\nCouple kids playin' grown ups\n\nDrinkin' cheap wine, dancin' in the kitchen\n\nAnd you can't wait to turn the lights out\n\n'Cause you know when you lay your head down\n\nThere's a dream of the ring layin' by your side\n\nAnd I'm thanking God I get to be the guy\n\n\n\nKissing a girl goodnight\n\nTime will slow down, heart will beat faster\n\nIn that moment, nothing else matters\n\nYou'll see forever when you close your eyes\n\nAnd you're kissing a girl tonight\n\nHolding your breath, holding up close\n\nI don't want it to end, and then it's over\n\nAnd you're counting down the hours till the next time\n\nYou're kissing a girl goodnight\n\nKissing a girl goodnight\n\n\n\nShe's only three, lookin' up at me\n\nSay amen, took her in and she wrapped her\n\nTiny arms around my neck so tight\n\nAnd I'm thinking, God I get to be the guy\n\n\n\nKissing a girl goodnight\n\nTime will slow down, heart will beat faster\n\nIn that moment, nothing else matters\n\nYou'll see forever when you close your eyes\n\nAnd you're kissing a girl tonight\n\nHolding your breath, holding up close\n\nI don't want it to end, and then it's over\n\nAnd you're counting down the hours till the next time\n\nYou're kissing a girl goodnight\n\nYou're kissing a girl goodnight\n\nKissing a girl goodnight\n\nKissing a girl goodnight",
