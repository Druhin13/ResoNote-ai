  "lyrics": "Think we can see Mercury, following the light\r\nDriving to the restaurant while my lipstick dries\r\nYeah, we've got next to nothing but nothing feels so right\r\nAs stumbling through the dark with you, comets in the sky\r\nBaby, wherever we go\n\nBreathe a little bit closer\n\nDrive up, right into the storm\n\nAnd fade into the night\n\n\n\nWe just know how\n\nHolding me with tightness\n\nA beautiful alliance\n\nWindows roll down\n\nYeah, we got the timing\n\nRight down to a science\n\n\n\nRight down, yeah right down to it\n\nRight down to, right down to it\n\nRight down\n\nRight down to a science\n\n\n\nSink beneath the surface while reaching for the stars\n\nThe world is out of focus like all the passing cars\n\nBreathing in the temperature filtered through your scarf\n\nIt's bigger than molecular, it's everything we are\n\n\n\nBaby, wherever we go\n\nBreathe a little bit closer\n\nDrive up, right into the storm\n\nAnd fade into the night\n\n\n\nWe just know how\n\nHolding me with tightness\n\nA beautiful alliance\n\nWindows roll down\n\nYeah, we got the timing\n\nRight down to a science\n\n\n\nRight down, yeah right down to it\n\nRight down to, right down to it\n\nRight down\n\nRight down to a science\n\n\n\nSomething about the way we ride\n\nI think we might be in our prime\n\nWe're brighter than a socialite in the dark\n\nSomething about the way we ride\n\nI think we might be in our prime\n\nWe're brighter than a socialite in the dark\n\n\n\nWe just know how\n\nHolding me with tightness\n\nA beautiful alliance\n\nWindows roll down\n\nYeah, we've got the timing\n\nRight down to a science\n\nRight down to a science",
