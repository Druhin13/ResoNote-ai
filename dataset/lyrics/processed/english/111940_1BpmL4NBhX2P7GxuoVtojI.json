  "lyrics": "Summer was long\r\nAnd it's suffocating when you're alone\r\nI gave you a call\r\nBaby, I could come by, help forget it all\r\n'Cause in this sticky weather, oh, it's really hard to sleep\r\nAs you know too well\n\nAnd when we dig together, oh, you make me feel so cheap\n\nBut I can't help myself\n\n\n\nFilthy and petulant soul\n\nI wanna give it to you\n\nI'll just unsee what you do\n\n'Cause I'm so drunk on you\n\nBaby, you're all that I want\n\nI want you all to myself\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\n\n\nI left in the night\n\n'Cause you don't like to see me in the daylight\n\nAnd maybe you're right\n\nWe don't get on so well, when we lose the high\n\nAnd lovers on the subway that put on a shift for me\n\nBut I just felt an inner lust\n\n'Cause every love story always end in tragedy\n\nIf you wait long enough\n\n\n\nFilthy and petulant soul\n\nI wanna give it to you\n\nI'll just unsee what you do\n\n'Cause I'm so drunk on you\n\nBaby, you're all that I want\n\nI want you all to myself\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\n\n\nForgive me 'cause sometimes I forget\n\nI got my own two hands clenched around my neck\n\n\n\nFilthy and petulant soul\n\nI wanna give it to you\n\nI'll just unsee what you do\n\n'Cause I'm so drunk on you\n\nBaby, you're all that I want\n\nI want you all to myself\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\n\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\nOh, but you know me too well, well, well\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\nOh, but you know me too well\n\nOh, but you know me too well, well, well",
