  "lyrics": "And I got the world in the palm of my hands\r\nAnd I, all I wanna do is make you dance\r\nIf I never see your face again, will I remember?\r\nEvery time we go out, free drinks, sitting in the VIP\r\nTwenty minutes in, wanna leave quick\r\nDo you wanna roll with me?\n\nIf I never see your face again, know I will remember\n\n\n\nLet's runaway\n\nWe could leave this crowd\n\nRunaway at the speed of sound\n\nIf you need to breathe\n\nI’ll be your remedy\n\nSo runaway, runaway\n\nRunaway with me\n\n\n\nOh, we, we could drive to the midnight sun\n\nWe're free, we're living like we just begun\n\nIf I never see your face again, know I will remember\n\n\n\nLet's runaway\n\nWe could leave this crowd\n\nRunaway at the speed of sound\n\nIf you need to breathe\n\nI’ll be your remedy\n\nSo runaway, runaway\n\nRunaway with me\n\n\n\nPedal to the floor, got the windows down in a rental car\n\nHands on the wheel and your eyes light up like a thousand stars\n\nIf we never see the world again, know we will remember\n\n\n\nLet's runaway\n\nWe could leave this crowd\n\nRunaway at the speed of sound\n\nIf you need to breathe\n\nI’ll be your remedy\n\nSo runaway (runaway, runaway...)",
