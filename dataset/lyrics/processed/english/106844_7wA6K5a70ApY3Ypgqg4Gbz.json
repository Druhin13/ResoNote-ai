  "lyrics": "We received our bloody circles in the mail\r\nOnly see what's really important when it's nailed\r\nAs a teen, my Lord and savior was a male\r\nTire trucks and six steel strings that keep me frail\r\nIt's the worst I've ever felt when it hails\r\nBroken teeth and bloody nose but least it snowed\n\nInstantly tried, oh, I cried and cut a line\n\nAnd my eyebrow acted like the boys who tell\n\nAnd my teacher told me that this made her sad\n\nHad to act just like the others to get around\n\nFriday nights alone in heaven with my board\n\n\n\nLike, growing up I have always heard or like, I was always hyperaware of\n\nThe things that the people around me who were charged with my care\n\nOr told me, like, be silent or be quiet\n\nOr be ashamed or hide\n\nOr perform a version of myself that wasn't really me\n\nAnd so, I think that through my life I've always been hyperconscious and aware of not going into spaces and seeking too much attention\n\nUm, because part of survival is, like, being able to just fit in\n\nTo be seen as normal and to, like, quote-unquote belong\n\nBut I think that so often in society in order to belong means that we have to, like, shrink parts of ourselves",
