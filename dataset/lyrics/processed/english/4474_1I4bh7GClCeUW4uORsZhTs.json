  "lyrics": "The devil's moved from Georgia\r\nHis mission's still the same\r\nThe world's become his oyster once again\r\nIf you don't think you're worthy\r\nAnd you don't meet the cause\r\nHe knows what's going on behind closed doors\n\n\n\nBeware there's voodoo in the night\n\nEvil never dies\n\nEvil never dies\n\n\n\nA master of deception\n\nWho takes you by the hand\n\nThen leads you to the palace of the damned\n\nHe pulls the strings inside you\n\nAnd plays upon your fears\n\nYour final scream is music to his ears\n\n\n\nBeware there's voodoo in the night\n\nEvil never dies\n\nEvil never dies\n\n\n\nI'm caught up in the voodoo\n\nTrying to break free\n\nI feel I'm being smothered\n\nTrapped by this entity\n\nBlackened clouds surround me\n\nFilling me with dread\n\nI can't escape the horror\n\nWith the devil in my head\n\n\n\nHe relishes the suffering\n\nCan't stand this heart attack\n\nMy life's been taken hostage\n\nAnd it's never coming back\n\n\n\nBeware there's voodoo in the night\n\nThe devil's got you in his sight\n\nEvil never dies\n\nEvil never dies\n\nEvil never dies\n\nEvil never dies",
