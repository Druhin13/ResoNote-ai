  "lyrics": "Looking for my breath\r\nIn these dark and stormy days\r\nAll I do is miss you\r\nDarling one, in so many ways\r\nShould I not look back?\n\nOh, I know, hour's getting late\n\nAnd I won't sing of sorrow, but please\n\nDon't take your love away\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the mountains\n\nAnd somewhere in New York\n\nWe'll forget the hour\n\nThere's that song we hummed before\n\n\n\nI heard them talk of sunshine\n\nAnd life in restful ways\n\nAnd I won't sing of sorrow, but please\n\nDon't take your love away\n\n\n\nSome nights will haunt me\n\nTill the daylight comes around\n\nI'll be fine, it's all I really own\n\nIt's always been around\n\n\n\nHanging on the dream of you\n\nI will fall through days\n\nBut I get up stubborn\n\nAll your warmth and funny ways\n\n\n\nShould I not look back?\n\nOh, I know, hour's getting late\n\nAnd I won't sing of sorrow, but please\n\nDon't take your love away\n\n\n\nSome nights will haunt me\n\nTill the daylight comes around\n\nI'll be fine, it's all I really own\n\nIt's always been around\n\n\n\nI run before the days\n\nWill have me to believe\n\nYour dance within me\n\nIt's only but a dream\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the mountains\n\nAnd somewhere in New York\n\nWe'll forget the hour\n\nAnd the long, long road",
