  "lyrics": "I remember waking up on November 9, 2016 and feeling a little bit nauseous\r\nIt felt like descending into a bottomless pit on a high speed rail\r\nCareening head first into the unknown\r\nDisgusted and depressed\r\nWe know the world is just a mess\n\nDistortion of reality\n\nThe truth is under arrest\n\n\n\nThis is the twilight zone\n\n\n\nConfusion and consent\n\nHas always been their intent\n\nDestruction of society\n\nUnless we dissent\n\n\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nWhere do we go from here?",
