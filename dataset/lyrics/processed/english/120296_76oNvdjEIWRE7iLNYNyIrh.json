  "lyrics": "Bells will be ringing this sad sad news\r\nOh what a Christmas to have the blues \nMy baby's gone I have no friends \nTo wish me greetings once again \nChoirs will be singing \"Silent Night\" \n\nChristmas carols by candlelight \n\nPlease come home for Christmas \n\nPlease come home for Christmas \n\n\n\nIf not for Christmas by New Years night \n\nFriends and relations send salutations \n\nSure as the stars shine above \n\nBut this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear \n\n\n\nThe time of year to be with the ones you love \n\nSo won't you tell me you'll never more roam \n\nChristmas and new Years will find you home \n\nThere'll be no more sorrow no grief and pain \n\n\n\nAnd I'll be happy, happy once again \n\nOh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain \n\nAnd I'll be happy, Christmas once again",
