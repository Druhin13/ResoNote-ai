  "lyrics": "I feel close\r\nWell maybe I’m not, heaven knows\r\nIt’s a spotlight stuck on the ceiling\r\nWhy are these the things that I’m feeling?\r\nThere’s so much time\r\nFor me to speak up, but I keep quiet\n\nI’ll complicate the most of the mantra\n\nThe power's out and I can’t turn the fan on\n\n\n\nSo can I call you tonight?\n\nI’m trying to make up my mind\n\nJust how I feel\n\nCould you tell me what’s real?\n\nI hear your voice on the phone\n\nNow I’m no longer alone\n\nJust how I feel\n\nCould you tell me what’s real anymore?\n\nCause I wouldn’t know\n\n\n\nVoice so low\n\nSneaking around, so it goes\n\nI always try my best to listen\n\nPicking up things that I can fidget\n\nCircle speed\n\nPacing around, watching my feet\n\nBatteries drain, I get the memo\n\n“I think that I might have to let you go”\n\n\n\nSo can I call you tonight?\n\nI’m trying to make up my mind\n\nJust how I feel\n\nCould you tell me what’s real?\n\nI hear your voice on the phone\n\nNow I’m no longer alone\n\nJust how I feel\n\nCould you tell me what’s real anymore?\n\nCause I wouldn’t know\n\n\n\n(We're sorry; you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)\n\n(If you feel you have reached this recording in error please check the number and try your call again)\n\nDon’t go, don’t go so easy\n\nDon’t go, don’t go and leave me\n\nDon’t go, don’t go so easy\n\nDon’t go, don’t go and leave me\n\nDon’t go, don’t go so easy\n\nDon’t go, don’t go and leave me\n\nDon’t go, don’t go so easy\n\nDon’t go, don’t go and leave me\n\n\n\nSo can I call you tonight?\n\nI’m trying to make up my mind\n\nJust how I feel\n\nCould you tell me what’s real?\n\nI hear your voice on the phone\n\nNow I’m no longer alone\n\nJust how I feel\n\nCould you tell me what’s real anymore?\n\nCause I wouldn’t know",
