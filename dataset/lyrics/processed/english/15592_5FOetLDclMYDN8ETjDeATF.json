  "lyrics": "While there was an air of a paradigm shift\r\nAnd men were dying for the death of the west\r\nOh yeah\r\nAnd the last thing I ever wanted to see was these brand new sparkles\r\nComing from your ever loving God damned eyes\r\nYeah\n\n\n\nIf you want it\n\nYou can have it\n\nIf you want to reap me\n\nTake it all away\n\n\n\nAnd everyone's a criminal\n\nEveryone's a criminal, every single last one of you is a criminal\n\nâ€˜Cause the world is a crime\n\nYeah\n\nYou stood there as some small and frail deity in front of me\n\nShining like the fall sun, making lucent patterns in our room through the windows\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nIf should want it\n\nGo ahead and take it\n\nIf you wanna reap me\n\nTake it all away\n\n\n\nTake it all away from me\n\nTake it all away from me\n\nNot an asset I possess measures up in merit next to this\n\nTake it all away from me\n\nFrom me\n\nFrom me\n\nFrom me",
