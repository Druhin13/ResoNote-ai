  "lyrics": "I could barely rap, I could barely dance\r\nI could barely laugh, I could barely hang\r\nAnd there's a male stripper doing a belly dance\r\nFor me and my boyfriend still the same\r\nAnd I'm drunk as fuck, nigga sucks up\r\nFor a reason to get my bucks up\n\nAnd the reason I care about society\n\nIs a good enough reason just to hire me\n\nBut honestly, see my mom can't walk and her lungs don't work like they used to\n\nAnd I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music\n\nI be saying shit just to fucking ruined it, I'm truant\n\nBut truthfully, the words had damage and it's fooling me\n\nBut even more cruel to be, this is here for you niggas that paid to hear me\n\n\n\nSometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off\n\nAnd I should probably spend my time writing rhymes in the dentist's office\n\nThat's killing two birds with one stone\n\nWhen I was younger, way before I was grown\n\nI wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers\n\nI'm saving my time for mics later\n\nI might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later\n\nI hate writers; I hate tweets; I hate journalists\n\nThey hate truth; they hate peace; they want my niggas to burn\n\n\n\nFlicking on the face of my wrist watch\n\nWatch the time stop just to speak up, watch life unfold\n\nAnd between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one way\n\nFuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line\n\nWhen it feel right, I'm fine, no I'm not lyin', don't ask me\n\nI'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it\n\nBut hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory\n\nEngulfed by the manifestation of death behind me\n\nAll my life I've felt inadequate, and through the years I've dealt with\n\nTragedy after tragedy, God, send a message\n\nSend a messenger my way, never claimed to be a saint, forgive me\n\nFeel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished\n\nI'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true\n\nI've come to expect my expectations aren't true\n\nBut I'm a master of believing my lies\n\nAnd you can't break me, and I can break at the speed of light\n\n\n\nI'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later\n\nLike she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper\n\nI'm afraid to speak my pains like you're lucky where you at\n\nYou cool but quit complaining 'bout all dat\n\nThat's why I'm showing up late\n\nI'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste\n\nFor myself, for the small talk with my sensei, where my sense at?\n\nFour-cylinder go round, Lincoln Tahoe pick me up\n\nDrop me off, I got bubble under my biceps, meet me into the sidestep\n\nEgo is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect\n\nFuck it I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now\n\nTell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down\n\nTell 'em I work like what, what time for me now\n\nWondering who is me now, wondering where you been now\n\nLose you in crowds, I see you now, fourteen, I see 'em all inside of me now\n\nBank account with less fees now, make it from ways to feed now\n\nThinking of ways to be everything but right now\n\n\n\nIt's crazy how things that are best reminisce when we check ourselves\n\nIt's crazy how people who left started feeling left out when we set for health\n\nStill a custom to nights filled with solitude\n\nI don't always remember to call goodnight\n\nI don't always remember my altitude\n\nI don't always remember to stop the fight\n\nBut I might check my sight, it ain't right\n\nYeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night\n\nUntil I'm forced to close my eyes\n\nBrain disease, parasite, eating me from inside\n\nEmotions bleed, I can't believe, how I'm sleeping through the night",
