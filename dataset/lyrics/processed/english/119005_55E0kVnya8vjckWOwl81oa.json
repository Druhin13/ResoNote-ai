  "lyrics": "I don't wanna see your face again\r\nUnless you dancin' in the crowd with your best friend\r\nTryna make the past irrelevant\r\nSo I pick the weapon sharp enough to cut the tension\r\nThought I got sick of your silhouette\r\nBut my hairs stand up every time that you are mentioned\n\nLately, I feel like the living dead\n\nBut secretly, I hope it never, ever, ever ends\n\n\n\nCaught me slipping, wasn't sober\n\nBut they said the party's over\n\nNicotine over my face now\n\nLeaving the house, now I'm a loner\n\nBut I can't forget how you makin' my heart move like a greyhound\n\n\n\nI need to be careful\n\nYou're moonlight, I'm werewolf\n\nAnd when you come through\n\nEverything gets teared up\n\nI'm straight from this graveyard\n\nYou linger on brave hearts\n\nI howl at the moon\n\nDon't know what to do\n\n\n\nGirl, I think I need a cigarette, yeah\n\nDoing all these things that I regret, yeah\n\nHeaven sent, but I'm hell-bent, yeah\n\nShoot a silver bullet in my chest, yeah\n\nI almost forget that I was nasty\n\nEverything last night distorted and I thought that I was classy\n\nWhy you gotta spite me, at me\n\nHappens on the nightly, running in these Nikes, yeah\n\n\n\nI wish that I didn't change the ZIP code\n\nI wish that I didn't try to go cash out the thrift store\n\nI wish that I didn't have to take off all these ripped clothes\n\nI wish that I never, ever, ever let the fifth pour\n\nNow I'm singing\n\n\n\nI need to be careful (Careful)\n\nYou're moonlight, I'm werewolf (Werewolf)\n\nAnd when you come through (Yeah)\n\nEverything gets teared up (Teared up)\n\nI'm straight from this graveyard (Graveyard)\n\nYou linger on brave hearts (Brave hearts)\n\nI howl at the moon\n\nDon't know what to do\n\n\n\nCaught me slipping, wasn't sober\n\nBut they said the party's over\n\nNicotine over my face now\n\nLeaving the house, now I'm a loner\n\nBut I can't forget how you making my heart move like a greyhound\n\nAnd I know you hear the rumors and the way that I would do ya\n\nSo you know that I can't stay around\n\nWhen they chase me, I maneuver, find a way to get back to ya\n\nGive you space so that you're safe now\n\n\n\nI need to be careful\n\nYou're moonlight, I'm werewolf\n\nAnd when you come through\n\nEverything gets teared up\n\nI'm straight from this graveyard\n\nYou linger on brave hearts\n\nI howl at the moon\n\nDon't know what to do",
