  "lyrics": "I used to know where the bottom was\r\nSomewhere far under the ocean waves\r\nUp on a ledge I was looking down\r\nIt was far enough to keep me safe\r\nBut the ground was cracked open\r\nThrew me in the ocean\n\nCast me out away at sea\n\nAnd the waves are still breaking\n\nNow that I awaken\n\nNo one’s left to answer me\n\n\n\nMy inside’s out my left is right\n\nMy upside’s down my black is white\n\nI hold my breath and close my eyes\n\nAnd wait for dawn but there’s no light\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\n\n\nI used to sleep without waking up\n\nIn a dream I made from painted walls\n\nI was a moment away from done\n\nWhen the black spilled out across it all\n\nAnd my eyes were made sober\n\nWorld was turned over\n\nWashing out the lines I’d seen\n\nAnd my heart is still breaking\n\nNow that I awaken\n\nNo one’s left to answer me\n\n\n\nMy inside’s out my left is right\n\nMy upside’s down my black is white\n\nI hold my breath and close my eyes\n\nAnd wait for dawn but there’s no light\n\n\n\nI’m a call without an answer\n\nI’m a shadow in the dark\n\nTrying to put it back together\n\nAs I watch it fall apart\n\n\n\nI’m a call without an answer\n\nI’m a shadow in the dark\n\nTrying to put it back together\n\nAs I watch it fall apart\n\n\n\nMy inside’s out my left is right\n\nMy upside’s down my black is white\n\nI hold my breath and close my eyes\n\nAnd wait for dawn but there’s no light\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore\n\nNothing makes sense anymore anymore",
