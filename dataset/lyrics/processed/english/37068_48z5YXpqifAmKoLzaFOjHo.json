  "lyrics": "If you hear\r\nA song in blue\r\nLike a flower crying\r\nFor the dew\r\nThat was my heart serenading you\r\nMy prelude to a kiss\n\n\n\nIf you hear a song that grows\n\nFrom my tender sentimental woes\n\nThat was my heart trying to compose\n\nA prelude to a kiss\n\n\n\nThough it's just a simple melody\n\nWith nothing fancy\n\nNothing much\n\nYou could turn it to a symphony\n\nA Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch\n\n\n\nOh how my love song gently cries\n\nFor the tenderness within your eyes\n\nMy love is a prelude that never dies\n\nA prelude to a kiss\n\n\n\n(bridge)\n\n\n\nThough it's just a simple melody\n\nWith nothing fancy\n\nNothing much\n\nYou could turn it to a symphony\n\nA Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch\n\n\n\nOh how my love song so gently cries\n\nFor the tenderness within your eyes\n\nMy love is a prelude that never dies\n\nA prelude to a kiss",
