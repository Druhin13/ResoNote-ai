  "lyrics": "Talking\r\nWhy's everyone always talking?\r\nNoise in my head, but it’s nonsense\r\nI can't feel nothing\r\nGuarded\r\nDon't overthink how we started\n\nKnew from the second you walked in\n\nThis could be something\n\n\n\nEverybody’s looking for love to start a riot\n\nBut every time I look in your eyes\n\nThe world gets quiet\n\n\n\nSo let it go, let it fall, let it fly\n\nWe'll keep on trying\n\n'Cause I knew I was in love with you\n\nWhen we sat in silence\n\n\n\nDreaming\n\nI'm wide awake while I'm dreaming\n\nSeeing in your eyes what you're thinking\n\nSo please don't worry\n\nWaiting\n\nKnow that I'll always be waiting\n\nDo you believe what I’m saying?\n\nI’m in no hurry\n\n\n\nEverybody's looking for love to start a riot\n\nBut every time I look in your eyes\n\nThe world gets quiet\n\n\n\nSo let it go, let it fall, let it fly\n\nWe’ll keep on trying\n\n'Cause I knew I was in love with you\n\nWhen we sat in silence\n\n\n\nSat in silence\n\nSat in silence\n\nSat in silence\n\nWhen we sat in silence\n\nSat in silence\n\nSat in silence\n\nSat in silence\n\nWhen we sat in silence\n\n\n\n'Cause I knew I was in love with you\n\nWhen we sat in silence",
