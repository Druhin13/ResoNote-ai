  "lyrics": "We took our first pill when\r\nthe music was shit\r\nI said \"fuck dancing all night\"\r\nbut then that's just what we did\r\nIt felt like flooooating\r\nIt felt like floating\n\n\n\nYour body was warm when\n\nI laid by your side\n\nI said \"I'm glad I have found you\n\nAnd I'm glad we're alive\"\n\nIt feels like floooating\n\nIt seems like floooating\n\nIt seems like floating\n\n\n\nWe laid by the river\n\nWe looked at the stars\n\nI said \"how tiny we are girl,\n\nhow tiny we are!\"\n\nIt feels like floooating\n\nIt feels like floooating\n\nIt feels like floating\n\n\n\nA lifetime is short, girl\n\nand death is so long\n\nI don't belive in no heaven\n\nI just hope that I'm wrong\n\nI hope we're floooating\n\nI hope we're floating\n\n\n\n'Cause watching the world\n\nI don't understand\n\nIt just makes much more sense with\n\nMy hand in your hand\n\nIt feels like floooating",
