  "lyrics": "It ain't New York City\r\nAnd it ain’t LA\r\nWe ain't got no rooftop bars\r\nLike they do on Broadway\r\nIt's just a little town square, middle of nowhere\n\nAin’t even big enough to be a map dot\n\nWe ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot\n\nWith the little bit that we got\n\n\n\nWe got a little somethin' somethin' we can throw on ice\n\nFind us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high\n\nWith your girl and your boys by a fire making noise\n\nIn a field on a Friday night\n\nWe got some George Strait songs that we turn up loud\n\nLivin' it up 'til the sun comes back around\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nWho said there’s nothing to do\n\nWho said there’s nothing to do\n\nIn this nothing to do town\n\n\n\nYeah our way of living, no it ain't complicated\n\nDon’t knock it 'til you try it, yeah you might not hate it\n\nAround here we work and we play, cuss and we pray\n\nAnd at the end of a long, hard day\n\n\n\nWe got a little somethin' somethin' we can throw on ice\n\nFind us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon’s up high\n\nWith your girl and your boys by a fire making noise\n\nIn a field on a Friday night\n\nWe got some Brooks & Dunn songs that we turn up loud\n\nLivin' it up 'til the sun comes back around\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nIn this nothing to do town\n\n\n\nIt's just a little town square, middle of nowhere\n\nAin't even big enough to be a map dot\n\nWe ain't got a lot but we sure do a lot\n\nWith the little bit that we got\n\n\n\nWe got a little somethin' somethin' we can throw on ice\n\nFind us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon's up high\n\nWith your girl and your boys, by a fire making noise\n\nIn a field on a Friday night\n\nWe got some Tim McGraw songs that we turn up loud\n\nLivin' it up 'til the sun comes back around\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nWho said there's nothing to do\n\nIn this nothing to do town\n\n\n\nOur little nothing to do town",
