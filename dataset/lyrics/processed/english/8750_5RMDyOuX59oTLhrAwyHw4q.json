  "lyrics": "Fever rising in the setting sun\r\nCocaine in your eyes and bullets in your gun\r\nAnd blood in your nails is scratching for the face\r\nWith a noose 'round your neck and a needle in your vein\r\nOoh, and you say...\n\nHow did I get here and can I get back\n\nI thought I was having fun, but no\n\nI was just looking for the one\n\nAlways - looking for the one\n\n\n\nWell, you don't thank fuck that you got a home\n\nNow your friends have left you and you're on your own\n\nAnd the woman in your life wasn't quite enough\n\nSo, you let her go and leave you and it broke your heart\n\n\n\nOoh, and you say...\n\nHow did I get here and can I get back\n\nI thought I was having fun, but no\n\nI was just looking for the one\n\nAlways - looking for the one\n\n\n\nWell, your mind is empty and your heart is cold\n\nAnd your last routines are getting old\n\nNow, people seeing through your web of lies\n\nAnd they're fucking the demons that war inside\n\n\n\nOoh, and you say...\n\nHow did I get here and can I get back\n\nI thought I was having fun, but no\n\nI was just looking for the one\n\nAlways - looking for the one\n\n\n\nCareful what you wish for from the steady life\n\nIf you want too much you might lose your mind\n\nIf you only want the woman you saw on TV\n\nThen your eyes are open but you just can't see\n\n\n\nOoh, and you say...\n\nHow did you get here and will you get back\n\nI thought we were having fun, but no\n\nWe were just looking for the one\n\nAlways - looking for the one\n\n\n\nHow did I get here and can I get back\n\nI thought I was having fun, but no\n\nI was just looking for the one\n\nAlways - looking for you",
