I'm 'bout to clean out the safe\n\nD-don't I look like somebody that just be bodyin' everything\n\nAll that talkin' is great but I don't be talkin' I air it out\n\nAll the problems have gotten easy to bury\n\nI'd rather drown them in Hendrick's, I'd rather kiss on my Mary\n\nI been broker way longer than I been rich so until it levels out\n\nImma take your mama to the Marriott and wear it out\n\nTook me so long to get it, gonna spread it out\n\nLet 'em know all about me when I'm dead and gone\n\n\n\nOne in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)\n\nOne in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)\n\nLook at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay you bubblin')\n\nLook at the cash (look)\n\nBubblin' (go)\n\nOne in the hand (look)\n\nOne in the hand (go)\n\nOne in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)\n\nLook at the cash, look at the cash, bubblin' (okay you bubblin')\n\nLook at the cash (look)\n\nBubblin'\n\n\n\nI'ma need all the fries you can give me\n\nAll the hot sauce, all the pies you can give me\n\nBetter be all or nothin', don't have me in the middle\n\nYou better be all you can, get higher than the limit\n\nSimplify for the Dumbos, plenty slides, I can shuffle\n\nHit the cadence with my young bitch, Isaac Hayes, Billy Ocean\n\nBut the old hoe with the cane stick\n\nLeft my slippers at the function, it's hard to run in Gucci slides\n\nChick, I thought you said you didn't have a husband\n\nI'ma stud, no cuckold, Jackie Chan, no trouble\n\nCan't clean it with a bib, blood drippin' from the cutthroats\n\nNo Lord, not me, I can never be the one you wanna stunt for\n\nMoney, money, that machine gun sprayed the Ferragamo store\n\nR.I.P. the times that I was broke, after life in 911 Porsche\n\nMatte black, lookin' clean, dead prezies in an envelope\n\nCookin up canard, waitin' for the antidote, runnin' out of time\n\nPatience thinner than a pantyhose\n\n\n\n\"Get over here and empty your pockets.\"\n\n\"I don't do that.\"\n\n\"You're my prisoner, you do what I tell you to do\n\nget over here.\"\n\n\"Haha, he's gonna get nasty about it!\"\n\n\"Fuckin' bitch!\"\n\n\"Frank! Cool it, huh?\"\n\n\"Stay the fuck outta this!\"\n\n\n\nOne in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)\n\nOne in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)\n\nLook at the cash, look at the cash bubblin' (okay you bubblin')\n\nLook at the cash (look)\n\nBubblin' (go)\n\nOne in the hand (look)\n\nOne in the hand (go)\n\nOne in the hand, one in the bag, bubblin' (look at you go)\n\nLook at the cash, look at the cash, bubblin' (okay you bubblin')\n\nLook at the cash (look)\n\nBubblin'",
