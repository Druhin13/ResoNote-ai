  "lyrics": "Sometimes the worst part of letting go\r\nIs when your heart starts losing hope\r\nYou feel a whole lot of nothing\r\nBut you gotta keep on running\r\nWhen it seems like the love is gone\n\nAnd you think you're on your own\n\nJust take a look around\n\nOpen up your eyes, you see the love never dies\n\n\n\nOh, I know it's hard to say goodbye\n\nBut, baby, don't you cry, it's all a part of life\n\nWhen you're alone and dakness fills the sky\n\nMy baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise\n\nOoh, baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise\n\nOoh, baby, don't you cry, 'cause the sun's gonna rise\n\n\n\nYou know the sun's gonna rise\n\nMy baby, don't you cry\n\nOh, the sun's gonna rise\n\n\n\nSometimes, I know, it could be so hard\n\nSearching for memories in the dark\n\nYou try to hold on something\n\nI promise you the morning's coming\n\n\n\nWhen it seems like the love is gone\n\nAnd you think you're on your own\n\nJust take a look around\n\nOpen up your eyes, you see the love never dies\n\n\n\nOh, I know it's hard to say goodbye\n\nBut, baby, don't you cry, it's all a part of life\n\nWhen you're alone and dakness fills the sky\n\nMy baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise\n\nOoh, baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise\n\nOoh, baby, don't you cry, 'cause the sun's gonna rise\n\n\n\nYou know the sun's gonna rise\n\nMy baby, don't you cry\n\nOh, the sun's gonna rise\n\n\n\nMy baby, don't you cry, the sun's gonna rise",
