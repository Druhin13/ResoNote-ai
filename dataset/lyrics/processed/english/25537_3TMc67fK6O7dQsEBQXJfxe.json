  "lyrics": "On the borders\nOn the brink of lies\nI set off firm in resolve\nDown the valley of twilight to search\nFor something lost\nIn timeless dusk\n\nDreams unfold\n\nIn the backwood's mist\n\nOf sacred memories untold\n\nTwo worlds collide\n\nDisturbance in the flow of time\n\nThe sky splits apart\n\nCommands me to surrender\n\nAnd part from the light\n\n\n\nProfound sadness\n\nHumbled and cast down to the ground\n\nAs lightning strikes me down\n\nNightbound\n\n\n\nI remember, I remember who we are\n\nAnd the long night comes with grace\n\nDemons of stone arise\n\nTo evoke new birth\n\nWhile sorrows past\n\nSinks into the earth\n\n\n\nProfound sadness\n\nHumbled and cast down to the ground\n\nAs lightning strikes me down\n\nNightbound\n\n\n\nI remember, I remember who we are\n\nAnd the long night comes with grace\n\n\n\nDying is the first and last\n\nBut nothing ever ends\n\nCrying, slipping from this world\n\nTo be reborn again",
