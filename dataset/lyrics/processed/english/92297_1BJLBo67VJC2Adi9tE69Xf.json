  "lyrics": "Your face looked new against the town\r\nYou've come to lose some memories\r\nLike you came to touch new grounds\r\nBut you want to lose\r\nThe weight of the wind\n\nRests hard on your shoulders\n\nIt's bringing you down\n\nThe one that you love\n\nWill never be found\n\n\n\nYou speak into the falling rain\n\nWords you'd lost, but found again\n\nI see their snakey arms entwined\n\nSo clear and cruel \n\nIn your jealous mind\n\n\n\nBut you've got to lose \n\nThe weight of the wind \n\nHard on your shoulders\n\nGetting you down \n\nThe one that you love\n\nWill never be found",
