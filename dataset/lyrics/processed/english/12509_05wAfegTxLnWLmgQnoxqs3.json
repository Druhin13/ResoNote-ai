  "lyrics": "Sometimes I wonder how we've made it has far as we have\r\nIt's certainly a burden and concerning how we've taken steps back\r\nI'm sick and tired of you now\r\nYou're sick and tired of me now\r\nWe've both got bad attitudes and trust issues\r\nIt's hard to deal with but somehow we get by fine\r\nWe do okay and that's impressive\r\nFor a couple of liars, hard to decipher\r\nI've lost my mind\r\nYou're just as crazy, it ain't healthy\r\nBut as much as I hate you, I love you\r\nI need you now\r\nDon't walk away from me, I swear I'll fix everything\r\nI've been trying my hardest too\r\nYou're the only one right for me, I swear you're my everything\r\nI'd put up a fight for you\r\nI can't believe what I'm hearing again\r\nThose words are a load of shit\r\nI'm sure this won't be the end of it\r\nAnd you'll keep it coming, cause you know it's getting under my skin\r\nYou like to push it to the limit, cause it gets in my head\r\nGoddamn\r\nIt's always the same thing\r\nThis is not where it ends\r\nPick yourself up and start over again\r\nDon't walk away from me, I swear I'll fix everything\r\nI've been trying my hardest too\r\nYou're the only one right for me, I swear you're my everything\r\nI'd put up a fight for you\r\nYou've got a lot of nerve\r\nIsn't it plain to see?\r\nI'm doing the best I can\r\nDon't walk away from me\r\nâ™ª\r\nWe do okay and that's impressive\r\nFor a couple of liars, hard to decipher\r\nI've lost my mind\r\nYou're just as crazy, it ain't healthy\r\nBut as much as I hate you, I love you\r\nI need you now\r\nDon't walk away from me, I swear I'll fix everything\r\nI've been trying my hardest too\r\nYou're the only one right for me, I swear you're my everything\r\nI'd put up a fight for you\r\nThis is not where it ends\r\n(I've been trying my hardest too)\r\nPick yourself up and start over again\r\n(I'd put up a fight for you)",
