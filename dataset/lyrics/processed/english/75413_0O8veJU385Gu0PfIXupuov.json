  "lyrics": "you look like the afternoon\r\nwhen you wake at 6 in the morning\r\nready right then, and we're kids again\r\nyou look like a sunny day\r\nwhen I look outside and it's storming\r\nwhen you look at me\n\nand blink so slowly\n\n\n\neverything you do makes it easy to fall in love with you\n\nnow, now. don't give me the run-around\n\nwith everything you do I just can't seem to get over you honey\n\nnow, now, don't give me the run-around\n\n\n\nI love when she writes for me\n\nand she doesn't even play the piano\n\nshe plays it so good, better than I could\n\nour love gets better everyday\n\nwith every touch and sound that your voice makes\n\nhow did we get here?\n\nit's better than last year\n\n\n\nso tell me now, tell me how I got so lucky, my dear\n\n\n\neverything you do makes it easy to fall in love with you\n\nnow, now, don't give me the run-around\n\nwith everything you do I just can't seem to get over you honey\n\nnow, now, don't give me the run-around\n\n\n\ndon't think twice\n\ndon't ask why\n\nwe have got to do these crazy things sometimes\n\nwe'll be fine, just realize that everything's alright\n\nwe are out of our minds \n\n\n\n(Thanks to Molly for these lyrics)",
