  "lyrics": "Six feet from the bottom\r\nI'm drowning in the water\r\n[?]\r\nOr will I be forgotten\r\nWill I sink or will I swim if I can't stand\n\nDrifting farther all alone in the ocean\n\nI can see the end, will I breathe again\n\nWash away like a footprint in the sand\n\nI'm still fighting but the current carries me away\n\nI try to surfacebut I'm caught beneath the waves\n\nI'm slipping further, I'm sinking under\n\n\n\nI close my eyes frozen inside my mind\n\nI now I swim and I live\n\nI know I don't and I die\n\nI'm hoping that I survive\n\nCause at this moment in life\n\nI got the shiver within\n\nIt's growing colder with time\n\n\n\nSix feet from the bottom\n\nI'm drowning in the water\n\nWill I reach [?]\n\nOr will I be forgotten\n\n\n\nI feel the air leave my lungs as I sink below\n\nFalling faster as I'm dragging to the undertow\n\nI'm losing hope and I'm growing cold\n\nHolding on when I feel like letting go\n\nI keep pretending that someday I'm gonna make it out\n\nThinking heavy that's what always seems to pull me down\n\nI'm slipping further, I'm sinking under\n\n\n\nI see the sky I'm freezing barely alive\n\nI feel the cold in my bones\n\n[?] preparing goodbyes\n\nI know the air in the night\n\nI know it's stereotypes\n\nI see you flowing like the ocean with my very own eyes\n\n\n\nSix feet from the bottom\n\nI'm drowning in the water\n\nWill I reach [?]\n\nOr will I be forgotten?\n\n\n\nEvery inch is a battle\n\nEvery breath is a war\n\nEvery minute's a struggle\n\nI can't fight this anymore\n\n\n\nSix feet from the bottom\n\nI'm drowning in the water\n\n\n\nSix feet from the bottom\n\nI'm drowning in the water\n\nWill I reach [?]\n\nOr will I be forgotten?\n\nBe forgotten\n\nWill I be forgotten?\n\nWill I reach [?]\n\nOr will I be forgotten?",
