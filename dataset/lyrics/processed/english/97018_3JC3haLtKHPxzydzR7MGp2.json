  "lyrics": "They met at school that's how it goes\r\nSome drinks and then a rose\r\nThen plans to meet again\r\nHe wrote her poems songs and prose\r\nShe knew that he'd propose\r\nShe only wondered when\n\n\n\nOne night before they went to bed\n\nHe kneeled on both knees\n\nAnd this is what he said\n\n\n\nI may not be wise\n\nAnd I won't save the day\n\nBut look in my eyes\n\nAnd know I'll always stay\n\nAnd I won't run away\n\nI won't run away\n\n\n\nSome years went by they had a child\n\nHe was funny strange and mild\n\nTheir love for him ran deep\n\nSome nights his dreams would drive him wild\n\nSo into bed she piled\n\nTo help him fall asleep\n\n\n\nOne night he couldn't get to bed\n\nSo she kneeled on both knees\n\nAnd this is what she said\n\n\n\nI may not be wise\n\nAnd I won't save the day\n\nBut look in my eyes\n\nAnd know I'll always stay\n\nAnd I won't run away\n\nI won't run away\n\n\n\nYou say it's safer on your own\n\nYou'd rather sleep alone\n\nThen grow to need me there\n\nBut I hope now you can see\n\nWhat my mom and dad showed me\n\nI'm not going anywhere\n\n\n\nI love you more and more each day\n\nTo love is not to leave\n\nSo hear me when I say\n\n\n\nI may not be wise\n\nAnd I won't save the day\n\nBut look in my eyes\n\nAnd know I'll always stay\n\nAnd I won't run away\n\nI won't run away",
