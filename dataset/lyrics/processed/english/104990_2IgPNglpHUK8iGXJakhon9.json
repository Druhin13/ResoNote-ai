  "lyrics": "Last night I dreamt that they dropped a bomb \nOh the sea ran dry and the winds had calmed\r\nSkyscrapers fell, they all turned to dust, \nTheir skeletons of steel were covered in rust\r\nAnd everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared\n\nOh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared\n\n\n\nColours were drained straight from the sky \n\nAnd nothing living had survived\n\nThe mountains were merely removed from the earth\n\nSilver and gold had lost all its worth\n\n\n\nAnd everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared\n\nOh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared\n\n\n\nI woke from the dream in a cold, cold sweat\n\nI was full of doubt and deep regret, \n\nSuddenly it was so clear to me; \n\nThere was nothing left in which to believe\n\n\n\nAnd everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared\n\nOh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared",
