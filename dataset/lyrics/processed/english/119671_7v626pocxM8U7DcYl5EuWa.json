  "lyrics": "You've always said that you'd love to live out here\r\nWhere you can smell the morning glories in the air\r\nThat sun shining through that crystal blue sure looks good on you\r\nCan't you just see a drive winding up that hill\r\nLeading to a house with flowers on the windowsill\n\nIt might take a while to clear this land\n\nBut I've got a plan\n\n\n\nDon't tell your mama yet, I'm begging you\n\nDon't tell your daddy 'til the paperwork goes through\n\nWhen the time is right we'll let em know\n\nRight now is between you, and me, and these here fenceposts\n\n\n\nDon't worry 'bout the money, got a couple things I can sell\n\nMr. Folder down the road could always use some help\n\nWhatever it takes, I'll go that extra mile if it makes you smile\n\n\n\nDon't tell your mama yet, I'm begging you\n\nDon't tell your daddy 'til the paperwork goes through\n\nWhen the time is right we'll let em know\n\nRight now is between you, and me, and these here fenceposts\n\n\n\nAin't nobody 'round to see us now\n\nWha'do'ya say we lay blanket down\n\nAnything that happens, baby, when we get this close\n\nStays between you, and me, and these here fenceposts\n\n\n\nYou've always said that you'd love to live out here",
