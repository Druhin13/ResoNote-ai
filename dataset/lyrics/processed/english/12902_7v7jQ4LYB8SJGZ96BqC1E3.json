  "lyrics": "Mile mark fifty-three, I feel empty\r\nWindmills circle as the air breathes\r\nPast the Dakota line, I feel empty\r\nLike a boarded-up cabin, abandoned and decaying away\r\nThere's no warmth in the tundra\n\nThere's no hope in a heart that doesn't beat\n\nI know that we're better off freezing\n\nThere's no hope in a heart that doesn't beat\n\n\n\nFlipping steadily, I feel nothing\n\nI can't tell if this is a dream\n\nFast beams of light, striking against my mind\n\nFlickering moments flood as I'm fading away\n\n\n\nThere's no warmth in the tundra\n\nThere's no hope in a heart that doesn't beat\n\nI know that we're better off freezing\n\nThere's no hope in a heart that doesn't beat\n\n\n\nAll waterfalls can't create\n\nThe same flash that they once had\n\nShattered wishbone lays upon the bay\n\nI am sorry I pulled it too late\n\n\n\nMile mark fifty-three, I feel empty\n\nMile mark fifty-three, I feel empty\n\nBrain cells swell, may your brain cells swell\n\nMay your brain cells swell with love, love, love",
