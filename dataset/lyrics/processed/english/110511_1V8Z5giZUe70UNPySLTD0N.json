  "lyrics": "When you heart's on the edge\r\nBarely hanging on like a midnight cigarette\r\nWhen the nights don't seem to end\r\nAnd that lonely wind is singing you to sleep once again\r\nI won't make a promise I can't keep\n\nLike a river flows to the ocean deep\n\n\n\nIt goes on and on\n\nBound to forever\n\nEven when we're gone\n\nIt goes on and on\n\nWe'll be together\n\nAt the rising of the dawn\n\nIt goes on\n\n\n\nWhen your mind's on the loose\n\nSlowly wearing out like a faded old tattoo\n\nWhen the days all look the same\n\nWhen that lonely wind keeps singing only you can ease the pain\n\n\n\nThat's the kind of bond that you can't break\n\nLike looking up at all the stars and space\n\n\n\nIt goes on and on\n\nBound to forever\n\nEven when we're gone\n\nIt goes on and on\n\nWe'll be together\n\nAt the rising of the dawn\n\nIt goes on\n\n\n\nDigging through the sands of time to find the way back home\n\nThe memories and pain, it keeps me hanging on\n\nTo know I'm not alone [?]\n\nEven on the darkest days together through the valley of the dark\n\n\n\nIt goes on and on\n\nBound to forever\n\nEven when we're gone\n\nIt goes on and on\n\nWe'll be together\n\nAt the rising of the dawn\n\nWe'll be together\n\nAt the rising of the dawn",
