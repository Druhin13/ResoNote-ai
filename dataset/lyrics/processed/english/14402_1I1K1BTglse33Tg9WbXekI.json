  "lyrics": "Said you got it “bad,” so you wrote it on your hands. So when your head is buried in ‘em, you won’t forget that you never had a chance\r\n“Real bad,” yeah you said you got it “real bad.” Well I got your number, but I don’t got anything to say to you anymore. You got it bad, Love\r\n“Real good,” that’s how you tell everyone you’ve been. Well you got my number, but I sure as hell ain’t waitin’ around for you anymore",
