  "lyrics": "Take a look around\r\nAnd see the world we think we know\r\nThen look closer\r\nThere's more to life than meets the eye\r\nA beauty to behold\r\nIt's all much bigger than we know\n\nIt's only just beginning to unfold\n\nSo let it all unfold\n\n\n\nFar beyond all reason in your mind\n\nThere's a world mysterious\n\nThere for you to find\n\nAll these questions\n\nThat we always have\n\nAll we are is curious\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that\n\nSo go 'round every corner\n\nSearch every part of the sky\n\n'Cause a life that's full of wonder\n\nIs a wonderful life\n\n\n\nDig beneath the surface\n\nFind the lessons there to learn\n\nAnd then dig deeper\n\nFeed your intuition\n\nDon't leave ant stone unturned\n\nBe the seeker of the truth\n\nListen when you hear it calling you\n\nYou know it's calling you\n\n\n\nFar beyond all reason in your mind\n\nThere's a world mysterious\n\nThere for you to find\n\nAll these questions that we always have\n\nAll we are is curious\n\nThere's nothing wrong with that\n\nSo go 'round every corner\n\nSearch every part of the sky\n\n'Cause a life that's full of wonder\n\nIs a wonderful life\n\nIs a wonderful life\n\nIs a wonderful life\n\nIs a wonderful life\n\n\n\nAnd the answers are far away\n\nLook closer\n\nLook closer\n\nLook closer\n\nLook closer",
