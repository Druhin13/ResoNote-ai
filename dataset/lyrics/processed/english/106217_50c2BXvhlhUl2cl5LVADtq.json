  "lyrics": "Dancing on the crumbling precipice\r\nThe rocks are coming loose just at the edge\r\nAre we laughing? Are we crying?\r\nAre we drowning? Are we dead?\r\nOr was it all a dream?\n\nThe bombs are getting closer everyday\n\n'That can never happen here' we used to say\n\nHave these wars come to our doorstep?\n\nHas this moment finally come?\n\nOr was it all a dream?\n\n\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nIs the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nTo become something greater than the violence in our nature?\n\nAre we not good, good enough or was it all a dream?\n\n\n\nTo a predetermined fate, are we condemned?\n\nOr maybe we're a book without an end?\n\nWe're not stories, we're not actors\n\nWe're awake and in control\n\nAnd this is not a dream\n\n\n\nSo can we break this mold?\n\nAnd set in motion something new\n\nForgetting what we know\n\nAn evolution overdue\n\nFight the current\n\nPull the ripcord\n\nGet away!\n\n\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nIs the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nTo become something greater than the violence in our nature?\n\nAre we not good, good enough?\n\n\n\nWe travel back to what we take\n\nWe need a storm; let's pray for rain now\n\nTo wash these roads away\n\nLet's get off track and wander far\n\nSame roads reducing destinations\n\nDo nothing but show our heart\n\nWe're talking in our sleep\n\nAnd sleeping through our lives\n\nWe dream of the places where we never die\n\nWe step from our shadows\n\nAnd into the light\n\n\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nIs the violence in our nature just the image of our maker?\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nTo become something greater than the violence in our nature?\n\nAre we not good enough? Are we not brave enough?\n\nAre we not good, good enough?\n\nOr was it all a dream?",
