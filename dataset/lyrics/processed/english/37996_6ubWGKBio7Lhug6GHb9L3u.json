  "lyrics": "Love me like fighting thru yellow tape, \n'til you find that the face ain't mine and it set you straight, \nBut you find that the face was in line with your other name, \nSo you repast, front of the line to get a plate, \nOr love me like a purchase on 47th and 6th, \nAnd the Russian jeweler knock off $100 off what you pick, \n\nIn the middle of February your sleeves up off your wrist, \n\nAnd you add another $100 when discussing what you spent, \n\nAnd the discussion hit a switch \n\nAnd it turns to where you tucking your wrist, \n\nOr you get to untucking your suspense, \n\nAnd all the suspense of it leads to adrenaline running \n\nAnd it's orchestrated all from the other side of the fence, \n\nAnd then love me like that side of the fence love bottom lines, \n\nWhile their kids call their friends kids and they holla \"slime”, \n\nAnd they don't get the gist but they get what it can provide, \n\nAnd they still don't know how to pronounce \"collards\" but it's fine, \n\nLove me for not assuming that you see me and assume \n\nI'm pursuing how you see me tryna lead you out your gloom, \n\nOr maybe you assume that you see me in the scenery you knew, \n\nAnd I ain't never did a scene but it's cool, right?, \n\nLove me for overlooking what I ain't have to, \n\nChose you when you didn't choose you when you had to, \n\nPretend it never happened if mine should ever ask you, \n\nWouldn't take much to revert to what your past knew \n\nLove me like Harlem loves Pan Pan's memory, \n\nStanding on display off of hand to hand symmetry, \n\nCameras get in play while you handle what the ticket be, \n\nAnd candles on the way if you ain't handing out dinner seats, \n\nSo love me like I introduced you Dominicans, \n\nWhether it was Ayisha Diaz or her kin and them, \n\nTalking bout a price and what it's worth to be the middleman, \n\nFitted for a crown and how it works and the expense of it, \n\nLove me like the drummer, love me like never running outta runners, \n\nLove me like what we sung before they hung us, \n\nHymn's getting lost in the clouds when they was flung up, \n\nOr shells getting caught in the crowd by the wrong “others”, \n\nLike, other than you, and other than him, \n\nUntil they learn those exceptions turn to others with them, right?, \n\nOr, otherwise shooting for the other side, \n\n'til they box you without a trial on a 1-5, \n\nAnd then love me like you was Venida Browder, \n\nPickets outside and you just tryna ease the crowd up, \n\nKnowing your heart died makes your heart beat louder, \n\nUntil the speakers blow and it lift you up from around us\n\nLove me like we-loved the legacy that her youngest would become, \n\nAnd the illusion of no reruns, \n\nLove me like turning down a plea when you need one, \n\nBut knowing that your word is worth more than what a plea does, \n\nLove me like getting pussy off a DM, \n\nThe turn around time at her door before the week ends, \n\nCaution she ain't throw out before, but now she in, \n\nAnd her heart beat sitting at the door that let you leap in\n\nLove me like pictures on the wall not resembling \n\nYou so them pictures on the wall start trembling \n\nAnd you got pictures for the wall that can fit on it \n\nBut dude start thinking bout his wall and that's the end of it, \n\nLove me like '88 3s, Nike Air heels, \n\nDropping $220 will take away how fear feels\n\nI'm $700 first day, word to the steering wheel, \n\nKites for who bleeding but this a hype we believe in \n\nLove me like not understanding the hype of it, \n\nBut you love it so there ain't no one else who might love it, \n\nOr loving it since you understand cause you was there, \n\nWhen it was misunderstood at $100 a pair, yeah, \n\nLove me like the moment that the jakes leave, \n\nKnowing that's another 24 with no the state greens, \n\nMy man said his aim dirty but his name clean, \n\nTried to tell his mother the difference before the day leave, \n\nTold her love him for every chain that he wore, \n\nEvery serial number scratched, every tre in the drawer, \n\nEvery feeling she ever had where she awakes to a call \n\nThat he's gone, it never happened so don't blame the allure\n\nLove me like Jada love Sheek love Styles \n\nLove LOX lovers all geeking thru the crowd, \n\nLove me like me at 14 geeking out, \n\nOr 20 years later still screaming who it's bout, \n\nLove me like a J dub's dedication, \n\nFollowing their lead 'cause they seem to have better patience, \n\nYou fear what you don't understand or levitate with, \n\nI say that with a pint in my hand, that's regulation \n\nLove me like my son on the way when I see his charm, \n\nAnd by the time you hear this he'll be in my arms, \n\nSame arms forever here where he belongs, \n\nIs the same arms that Ima bare if you mean him harm\n\nLove me like all of the above in a bag, \n\nSinging \"fuck 'em all!\" when you in love with a stash, \n\nOr singing \"fuck 'em all!\" when you in love with a flag \n\nThat takes what you want, or loves what you had, love is love",
