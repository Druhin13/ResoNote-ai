  "lyrics": "There was one blue September, baby\r\nI got my skin and now my temper in the palm of my hands\r\nI let you come over and kiss my pain\r\nBut I knew he was crumbling before he was crumbling\r\nBut now I'm scared of big crowds\n\nHang my hand, never speak loud\n\nReverse my mind to remain proud\n\nAnd it's all because you set me on fire (on fire)\n\nOn fire (on fire)\n\nOn fire (on fire)\n\nI'm on fire\n\n\n\nYour thoughts were dancing on the window of the M train\n\nNo blood, no guts but I saw the pain\n\nI saw you crying but you wouldn't let me see your face\n\nYou're trying to hide it but you can't hide it\n\nI can't even hide it\n\n\n\nBut now I'm scared of big crowds\n\nHang my hand, never speak loud\n\nReverse my mind to remain proud\n\nAnd it's all because you set me on fire (on fire)\n\nOn fire (on fire)\n\nOn fire (on fire)\n\nI'm on fire\n\n\n\nYou like it when I hold my voice back\n\nYou like to take advantage of just that\n\nYeah, you wish I'd always sit back\n\nAnd shut the fuck up\n\nYou like it when I hold my voice back\n\nYou like to take advantage of just that\n\nYeah, you wish I'd always sit back\n\nAnd shut the fuck up\n\n\n\nYou like it when I\n\nYou like it when I\n\n(Maybe)\n\nYou like it when\n\nYou like it when I\n\nYou like it when I\n\nYou like it when I\n\nYou like it when I\n\n\n\nBut now I'm scared of big crowds\n\nHang my hand, never speak loud\n\nReverse my mind to remain proud\n\nAnd it's all because you set me on fire (on fire)\n\nOn fire (on fire)\n\nOn fire (on fire)\n\nI'm on fire",
