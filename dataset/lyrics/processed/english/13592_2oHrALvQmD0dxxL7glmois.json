  "lyrics": "Anyone who walks down my path...\r\nAnyone who walks down my path after it snows and cover up their footprints\r\nEvery time you shut my in I shiver in the cold\r\nEvery day I stay in bed I get a little worse\r\nAnyone who walks through my door is already done. Is already done for...\n\nIf you walked a mile in my shoes you'd never choose, you'd never come back here\n\n\n\nEvery time you shut my in I shiver in the cold\n\nEvery day I stay in bed I get a little worse\n\n\n\nAs far as I can tell you never got it right...\n\nAnd everyone I know has all been turned away, scattered in the dark\n\nSeen this place a dozen times before but not as empty, as empty as it is\n\n\n\nAnyone who walks down my path...",
