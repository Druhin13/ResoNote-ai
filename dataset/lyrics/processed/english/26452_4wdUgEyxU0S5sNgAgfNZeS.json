  "lyrics": "I walk between the dividing lines\r\nI dance around the exit signs\r\nI hate the world more than I hate myself\r\nI can't pretend that it's a cry for help\r\nTattered manifestos litter the mind\n\nDiplomatic plans ravaged by time\n\nIt never really was the truth or lies\n\nWe just gave up and said our goodbyes\n\n\n\nSo hold me, hold me, hold me like a heaven\n\nI want some faith and wanna be forgiven\n\nI wanna feel your divine intervention\n\nSo hold me, hold me\n\nSo hold me, hold me like I'm lost in your heaven\n\n\n\nWhat is the future of the future?\n\nWhen memory fades and gets boarded up\n\nAll the ties that bind have come undone\n\nSeconds of hate, tiny screams of love\n\n\n\nSo hold me, hold me, hold me like a heaven\n\nI want some faith and wanna be forgiven\n\nI wanna feel your divine intervention\n\nSo hold me, hold me\n\nSo hold me, hold me like I'm lost in your heaven\n\n\n\nSo hold me, hold me, hold me like a heaven\n\nI want some faith and wanna be forgiven\n\nI wanna feel your divine intervention\n\nSo hold me, hold me\n\nSo hold me, hold me like I'm lost in your heaven",
