  "lyrics": "Every endless word, I have nothing here\r\nSick of all that was, tired of all that is\r\nEvery hated love I have broken in\r\nSick of fucking up, tired of falling in\r\nAnd all that I regret\n\nI have before, I will again\n\n\n\nIt's over now. Are you running away?\n\nI come apart as I lay in your way\n\nIt's in my blood, let the sky fall down\n\nI won't let grow, my oblivion\n\n\n\nCounting every breath, I am my own fear\n\nNothing ever was, nothing ever is\n\nEvery halo lost, I am worn within\n\nNothing left to harm, nothing left to live\n\n\n\nAnd all that I regret\n\nI have before, I will again\n\n\n\nIt's over now. Are you running away?\n\nI come apart as I lay in your way\n\nIt's in my blood, let the sky fall down\n\nI won't let grow, my oblivion\n\n\n\nFace the monster Iâ€™ve become\n\n(And fight, your hate will not become)\n\nIn the ground we rise to burn\n\n(Maybe your life will let me love)\n\nForgive my heart\n\n\n\nIt's over now\n\nI come apart\n\nIt's in my blood, let the sky fall down\n\nI won't let grow, my oblivion",
