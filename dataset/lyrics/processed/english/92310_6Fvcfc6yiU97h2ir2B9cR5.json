  "lyrics": "Gotta find, gotta find, gotta find my style\r\nGet atop, get atop with the stop and smile\r\nSee I've got eyes for a lady, lately\r\nAnd I rise to the prize like on television\r\n'Cause I've been using truth, dear\n\nGive it 9 to the 5 for the river saving\n\nI'm changing not at all\n\n\n\nOh no! It's sinking in\n\nI'm a man with a plan when it comes to this so\n\nOh no! I'm sinking in the deep end\n\nTry and change my\n\nTry and change my mind\n\n\n\nInterrupting my love is an inconvenient shout\n\nWhat of that bitchy slap from the hand of summer drought?\n\nIn a life, in a time I would hate to lose my cloud eye\n\nLady, lately\n\n\n\nDo you know who knows?\n\nIt's not sunk if it floats\n\nProof in days that rain\n\nEvery day I please my appetite\n\n\n\nOh no! It's sinking in\n\nI'm a man with a plan when it comes to this so\n\nOh no! I'm sinking in the deep end\n\nTry and change my\n\nTry and change my mind\n\n\n\nHear the voice from the mom for the wayward child\n\nBut I've been living large\n\nNevermind, nevermind no one let the faucet run\n\nTry and change my, try and change my mind\n\n\n\nOh no! I'm a man with a plan when it comes to this so\n\nOh no! I'm sinking in the deep end\n\nI'm a man with a plan when it comes to this so\n\nOh no! I'm sinking in the deep end\n\nI'm a man with a plan when it comes to this so\n\nOh no! I'm a man with a plan but it's comes to this, oh",
