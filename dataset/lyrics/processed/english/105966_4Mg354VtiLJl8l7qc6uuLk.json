  "lyrics": "Oh, oh, oh\r\nHe knows that he's got a hold on me\r\nLike the moon and sea, and when it gets dark\r\nWe lay down and look up at the stars\r\nAnd get scared about how small we are\n\n\n\nAll night, questioning things you spend your whole life answering\n\nSo I'm like, \"Quiet your mind, or you're gonna miss it\"\n\n\n\nWhat if the point is here? And what if the point is now?\n\nWhat if there's nothing left to figure out?\n\nIs that what the point is? That's what the point is\n\n\n\nHe said he met me once way before\n\nThere were dinosaurs in another life\n\nI cut my name right into his skin\n\nSo he's wondering if it's all a sign\n\n\n\nAll night, questioning things you spend your whole life answering\n\nSo I'm like, \"Quiet your mind, or you're gonna miss it\"\n\n\n\nWhat if the point is here? And what if the point is now?\n\nWhat if there's nothing left to figure out?\n\nIs that what the point is? That's what the point is\n\nWoah, oh\n\nWhat if the point is here? And what if the point is now?\n\nWhat if there's nothing left to figure out?\n\nIs that what the point is? That's what the point is",
