  "lyrics": "Crawling under a jealous sun\r\nI fear the ghost you could become\r\nSo I called upon the clouds\r\nRaindrops fell as I hit the ground\r\nHigher than the vultures fly\n\nDeeper than the blue in the desert sky\n\nThe oasis in the sands\n\nBringing life to the barren lands\n\n\n\nWe are waterborne\n\nWe are waterborne\n\n\n\nYou were my, you were my lifeline\n\nThe blood that runs in my veins\n\nWithout you, everything fades away\n\nYou were my, you were my lifeline\n\nThe blood that runs in my veins\n\nWithout you, everything fades away\n\n\n\nThe river now changes course\n\nTimeless reflections of our discord\n\nA generation taught upstream\n\nI don't need you\n\nBut you need me\n\n\n\nHigher than the vultures fly\n\nDeeper than the blue in the desert sky\n\nThe oasis in the sands\n\nBringing life to the barren lands\n\n\n\nWe are waterborne\n\nWe are waterborne\n\n\n\nYou were my, you were my lifeline\n\nThe blood that runs in my veins\n\nWithout you, everything fades away\n\nYou were my, you were my lifeline\n\nThe blood that runs in my veins\n\nWithout you, everything fades away\n\n\n\nNowhere to go\n\nWhen the worlds run dry\n\nNowhere to run\n\nWhen the waters rise\n\nUnstoppable force!\n\nNowhere to go!\n\nWhen the worlds run dry!\n\nNowhere to run!\n\nWhen the waters rise!\n\n\n\nYou were my, you were my lifeline\n\nThe blood that runs in my veins\n\nWithout you, everything fades away\n\nYou were my, you were my lifeline\n\nThe blood that runs in my veins\n\nWithout you, everything fades away",
