  "lyrics": "I still walk in that bar a little drunk\r\nI still ask you what you're drinking, what's your name\r\nI still kiss you by the shuffleboard, last call at 2am\r\nEven though we break up in the end\r\nI'll introduce you to my mom and dad\n\nSay \"I think I love her\" when you leave that room\n\nI still might take their advice when I say you're moving in\n\nEven though we break up in the end\n\n\n\nEven if I knew you'd be the one that got away\n\nI'd still go back and get you\n\nEven if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake\n\nOh, I'd still make it with you\n\nOver and over, again and again\n\nEven though we break up in the end\n\n\n\nI'd still play my favorite song in your car\n\nLet you love me to it, 'til it felt like ours\n\nNow all I hear is you in it, but I'd still let you ruin it\n\nEven though we break up in the end\n\n\n\nEven if I knew you'd be the one that got away\n\nI'd still go back and get you\n\nEven if I knew you'd be my best and worst mistake\n\nGirl, I'd still make it with you\n\nOver and over, again and again\n\nEven though we break up in the end\n\n\n\nYou've just had one too many tonight\n\nYou're just calling 'cause you're lonely, that's okay\n\nBut you know if you come over, I cannot let you in\n\nEven though we'll break up in the end\n\nI'd do it over and over, again and again\n\nEven though we break up in the end",
