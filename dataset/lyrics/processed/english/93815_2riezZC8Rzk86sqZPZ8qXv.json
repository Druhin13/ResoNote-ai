  "lyrics": "Baby, I'm a little faded\r\nBut I need to tell you lately\r\nI wouldn't change a thing, oh no, no\r\nMy favorite times are being lazy\r\nOnly Tempur-Pedic laying\r\nWe're quiet, listening, yeah\n\n\n\n'Cause we're both here, keeping our breath under control\n\nIt's calm, no fear, I don't wanna ever let go\n\n\n\nWhen I die, it's this I'll remember\n\nThe wind moving the curtains in your room\n\nThis moment's too good, I surrender\n\n'Cause there's no space in time\n\nThat compares to how I feel like right now\n\n\n\nWhen I'm dead, I want you stuck in my head\n\nI want you haunting my thoughts while my message is read\n\nI'd love for you to hear me\n\nKnow that there's a meaning I could never verbalize\n\nI'm too busy feeding off the simple way you make me feel soft\n\nIt's not easy loving life when I'm pissed off\n\nThat's why you came in and saved me, saved me\n\nLife is only just a daydream\n\n\n\nWhen I die, it's this I'll remember\n\nThe wind moving the curtains in your room\n\nThis moment's too good, I surrender\n\n'Cause there's no space in time\n\nThat compares to how I feel like right now\n\n\n\nWhen I die\n\n'Cause we're both here, keeping our breath under control\n\nIt's calm, no fear, I don't wanna ever let go\n\n\n\nWhen I die, it's this I'll remember\n\nThe wind moving the curtains in your room (In your room, oh)\n\nThis moment's too good, I surrender (I surrender)\n\n'Cause there's no space in time\n\nThat compares to how I feel like right now\n\n\n\nWhen I die\n\nIn your room, oh\n\nI surrender",
