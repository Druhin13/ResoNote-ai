  "lyrics": "Scars are aching, storming my veins\r\nI'm not afraid of the voices in my head\r\nEveryday it will come rush back\r\nIt won't save you from the misery you hold tight\r\nI can feel it in my chest\n\nI no longer regret\n\nI've been waiting for something for all this time\n\nI know what you got undercover\n\nThere's lies around the corner\n\nEverything is so fake I just wanna leave it\n\nCause I'm feeling oppressed and I can't stand it any longer\n\n\n\nCause I can't feel any breath on my face\n\nI'm so afraid of what's coming up next\n\n\n\nDon't cover up your skin\n\nI know you well\n\nYour scars mean more than anything\n\nI'm drowning in so deep\n\nWaves crashing down on me\n\nI'm watching you breathing in\n\n(Hey!)\n\n\n\nShe is heartbreaking, holding my hands\n\nDon't run away I won't follow you again\n\n\n\nAnd I'm afraid we've been lost in the dark\n\nYou know exactly all the words that hurt the most\n\nWe're living in your fears, we're faking it\n\nShow me your scars, it means much more to me\n\n\n\nWake me up from this dream\n\n\n\nCause I can't feel any breath on my face\n\nI'm so afraid of what's coming up next\n\n\n\nDon't cover up your skin\n\nI know you well\n\nYour scars mean more than anything\n\nI'm drowning in so deep\n\nWaves crashing down on me\n\nI'm watching you breathing in\n\n\n\nI'm watching you breathing in\n\n(Hey!)",
