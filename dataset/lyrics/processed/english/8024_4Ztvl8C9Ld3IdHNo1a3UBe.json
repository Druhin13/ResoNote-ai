  "lyrics": "Feel the sun on my face\r\nSharpened like a razor blade\r\nFeed the rising pain inside\r\nThe body, soul and brain\r\nLiving monster of the night\n\nYou made me what I’m today\n\nYou don’t have to scream and shout\n\nIn this silent place\n\n\n\nTrapped under the neon light\n\nAs long as the show’s alive\n\nThe welded flesh to sweat\n\nAnd blood still flows in hell\n\n\n\nWarden of your nightmare\n\nA trip down memory lane\n\nYou’re on the way, the end is nigh\n\nThere’s nothing to be saved\n\n\n\nLiving monster of the night\n\nYou made me what I’m today\n\nYou don’t have to scream and shout\n\nIn this silent place",
