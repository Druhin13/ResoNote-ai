  "lyrics": "We're breaking down your lights and doors\r\nBut we can't promise you no more\r\nAre you happy to come back for five whole nights?\r\nYou say you're sick of all your fears\r\nBut you keep coming back around here\r\nPerhaps it's time for you to be one of us now\n\n\n\nFive! Nights! Five Nights at Freddy's\n\nNow it's the finale and you weren't ready\n\nDon't! Cry! We're not so scary\n\nDon't make a scene and we'll end this quickly\n\nMaybe you've just lost your mind\n\nKicking and screaming, now you've lost your time\n\nBut we all know you're said and done\n\n\n\nNow we're bringing it back\n\nAnd the gang is on track\n\nAnd we're bringing a couple of friends\n\nThere are many of us\n\nAnd we're causing a fuss\n\nWe all know how the night will end\n\nNow you're hiding yourself\n\nBut you know very well\n\nThat it's making us one and the same\n\nWe're leaving you mangled\n\nOn strings you will dangle\n\nWith only yourself to blame\n\nHa ha!\n\nWe're back and revamped\n\nAnd there's not a thing you can do to stop us\n\nTonight\n\n\n\nFive! Nights! Five Nights at Freddy's\n\nNow it's the finale and you weren't ready\n\nDon't! Cry! We're not so scary\n\nDon't make a scene and we'll end this quickly\n\nMaybe you've just lost your mind\n\nKicking and screaming, now you've lost your time\n\nBut we all know you're said and done\n\n\n\nIt's been years, I've been alone in here\n\nI've forgotten what it's like for me to smell your fear\n\nAm I driving you insane?\n\nAm I eating at your brain?\n\nNo happy endings will ever find you\n\nYour heavy breathing and pain will end soon\n\nYou're picking up the pieces to the ghosts that will haunt you too\n\n\n\nFive! Nights! Five Nights at Freddy's\n\nNow it's the finale and you weren't ready\n\nDon't! Cry! We're not so scary\n\nDon't make a scene and we'll end this quickly\n\nMaybe you've just lost your mind\n\nKicking and screaming, now you've lost your time\n\nBut we all know you're said and done\n\n\n\nWe're voices in your head\n\nWe're the monsters under your bed\n\nThere's no tomorrow for you\n\nNo matter what they said\n\nYou know who you are\n\nWe know everything\n\nYou've come so far\n\nNow you pull the strings\n\nThat's right!\n\n\n\nFive! Nights! Five Nights at Freddy's\n\nNow it's the finale and you weren't ready\n\nDon't! Cry! We're not so scary\n\nDon't make a scene and we'll end this quickly\n\nMaybe you've just lost your mind\n\nKicking and screaming, now you've lost your time\n\nBut we all know you're said and done",
