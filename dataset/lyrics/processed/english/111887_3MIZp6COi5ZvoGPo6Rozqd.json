  "lyrics": "I could have fucked her for days\r\nBut thinking about it\r\nMaybe I just thrive on the chase\r\nAnd I'm in lust\r\nAnd you never take time to look through\n\nEverything I try, try to do for you\n\nAnd you, you, you need to prove, prove, prove you're in it\n\nAnd let go of every fear you had\n\n\n\nLay low, lay low, she knows, she knows\n\nBlow white straight to my brain\n\nWorks best when she's complaining\n\nAnd I said give me a break, I'm only human\n\n\n\nFucked with too many petty bitches, ain't got time for this shit\n\nThose peasant pussies probably took it but you'll take what you get\n\nI know, I know it's supposed to be give and take\n\nIt's just a show and I'm the one that takes the blame\n\n\n\nDon't stop faking\n\nMy conscience ain't afraid of you yet\n\nAnd if your soul's still fading\n\nI'm done contemplating with it\n\n\n\nYou're not a victim of shit\n\nI put myself on the back burner\n\nHeld myself back for you\n\nI'm a disposable fix\n\nI'm only stating the facts for you\n\nNow I got nothing to lose\n\nWatch me fly so high",
