  "lyrics": "Can you see me on the dance floor?\r\nWith my eyes half closed, searching for more\r\nCan you see me when I bite my lip?\r\nCan you see me when I swing my hips?\r\nI Bought this dress when I was thinking about your hands on me, babe\n\nSo take it off, lay me down in the night\n\nIn the moonshine\n\nIn the moonshine\n\n\n\nI Do it for the Rock N Roll Blues\n\nI Do it when I swing my boots\n\nI've been searching for sad ones like you\n\nI've been searching for the Rock N Roll Blues\n\n\n\nIn the dark night baby\n\nI Wait for you\n\nI Wait for the morning\n\nWill you wait for me too?\n\n\n\nI Bought this dress when I was thinking about your hands on me, babe\n\nSo take it off, lay me down in the night\n\nIn the moonshine\n\nIn the moonshine\n\n\n\nI Do it for the Rock N Roll Blues\n\nI Do it when I swing my boots\n\nI've been searching for sad ones like you\n\nI've been searching for the Rock N Roll Blues",
