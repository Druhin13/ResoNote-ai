I wanna dance with somebody\n\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\n\nYeah! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n\n\nOh! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\n\nYeah! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n\n\nI've been in love and lost my senses\n\nSpinning through the town\n\nSooner or later the fever ends\n\nAnd I wind up feeling down\n\nI need a man who'll take a chance\n\nOn a love that burns hot enough to last\n\nSo when the night falls\n\nMy lonely heart calls\n\n\n\nOh! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\n\nYeah! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n\n\nOh! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\n\nYeah! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nWith somebody who loves me\n\n\n\nSomebody who somebody who.... somebody who loves me,\n\nSomebody who somebody who... to hold me in his arms.\n\nI need a man who'll take a chance,\n\nOn a love that burns hot enough to last.\n\nSo when the night falls,\n\nMy lonely heart calls.\n\n\n\nOh! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\n\nYeah! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nWith somebody who loves me\n\nOh! I wanna dance with somebody\n\nI wanna feel the heat with somebody\n\nYeah!
