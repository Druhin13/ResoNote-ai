Light, light...)\r\nLight the way\r\nI don't come from a pretty place\n\nAnd I get mad when I don't get my way\n\nShe can't stand it when I drink\n\n'Cause I say whatever is in my brain\n\n\n\nAnd I have burned some bridges\n\nBut many bridges I burned light the way\n\nI have burned some bridges\n\nBut many bridges I burned light the way\n\n(Light, light... Light, light...)\n\nLight the way, light the way\n\n(Light, light... Light, light...)\n\nLight the way, light the way\n\n\n\nI can't help that my IPA\n\nMakes it easier to get through the day\n\nI don't think that my GPA\n\nSays anything 'bout the way I think\n\n\n\nAnd I have burned some bridges\n\nBut many bridges I burned light the way\n\nI have burned some bridges\n\nBut many bridges I burned light the way\n\nAnd I have burned some bridges\n\nBut many bridges I burned light the way\n\n\n\n(Light, light... Light, light...)\n\nLight the way\n\nThe sun is not in this stupid world\n\nThe sun is not in this stupid world\n\nThe sun is not in this stupid world\n\nThe sun is not in this stupid world, ooh",
