  "lyrics": "I used to get so scared of falling hard\r\n'Cause what if I couldn't get back up?\r\nTell myself I'm better off alone\r\n'Cause knowing me, I'd always run\r\nBut let's go fire\n\nGive in to desire\n\nI'm not gonna fight it\n\nNo,I won't deny that\n\n\n\nI'm giving up, I'm giving up\n\nReady for love\n\nIt's nothing to rush\n\nI'm giving up, I'm giving up\n\n'Cause you're the one\n\nIt's nothing to rush\n\n\n\nI'm giving up\n\nI'm giving up\n\n\n\nI got no limits in your arms\n\nThese boundaries with you are no fun\n\nAll my habits fall apart\n\nI let go with every touch\n\n\n\nBut let's go fire\n\nGive in to desire\n\nI'm not gonna fight it\n\nNo,I won't deny that\n\n\n\nI'm giving up\n\nI'm giving up\n\n\n\nTell me, who do you think you are?\n\nPour your madness into my heart\n\nTell me, who do you think you are?\n\nPour your madness into mine",
