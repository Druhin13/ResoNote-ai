  "lyrics": "Sad songs, over and over again\r\nHappiness is so far away\r\nMad love, just frustration and sin\r\nI can’t afford this way\r\nWe are just two souls with a broken heart\n\nWe are dreamers, nothing else to say\n\nWe were young, young, a paradise in\n\nBut memories are so far away\n\nSo far away\n\n\n\nSo far away\n\nSo far away\n\n\n\nSo far away, so far away, so far away\n\nSo far away, so far away, so far away\n\n\n\nStill wrong, over and over again\n\nI didn’t surf wave after waves\n\nI don’t know, what is a lovely embrace\n\nMaybe it hurts too much the same\n\n\n\nWe are just two souls with a broken heart\n\nWe are dreamers, nothing else to say\n\nWe were young, young, a paradise in\n\nBut memories are so far away\n\nSo far away\n\n\n\nSo far away\n\nSo far away\n\n\n\nSo far away, so far away, so far away\n\nSo far away, so far away, so far away",
