  "lyrics": "All these kind of places\r\nMake it seems like it's been ages\r\nTomorrow sun with building scraping skies\r\nI love this country dearly\r\nI can feel the lighter clearly\r\nBut never thought I'd be alone to try\n\nWords I was at Sundance Station\n\nSelling light and white camations\n\nYou were still alone\n\nMy wife and I\n\nBefore we marry, save my money\n\nBut my dear wife over\n\nNow I want to bring family state side\n\n\n\nTo rock the boat they sail a while\n\nScattered cross the course\n\nOnce a year I'll see them for a week or so\n\nAnd most had take a walk\n\n\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\n\nTake a walk, 0h-oh-oh\n\nI take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\n\n\nPractice isn't perfect\n\nWith the market cuts and loss\n\nI remind myself that times could be much worse\n\nMy wife won't ask me questions\n\nIt was not so much to ask\n\nAnd she'll never flaunt around an empty purse\n\n\n\nOnce my money lacking\n\nJust to stay a couple nights\n\nIn the silence she will stay the rest of her life\n\nI watch my little children\n\nAs I'm putting in the kitchen\n\nAnd I see them pray they never feel my strive\n\n\n\nBut then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone\n\nHe made some bad investments\n\nNow the counts are overdrawn\n\n\n\nI took a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\n\nTake a walk, 0h-oh-oh\n\nI take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\n\n\nHoney it's this loan I think I borrowed just to much\n\nWe had taxes we had balls\n\nWe had a lifestyle of fun\n\nBut I swear tonight I'll come home\n\nAnd we'll make love like we're young\n\nAnd tomorrow you'll cook dinner\n\nFor the neighbors and the kids\n\nWe could rent the part of socialists\n\nAnd all their ten taxes\n\nYou'll see I am no criminal\n\nI'm down on both bad ends\n\nI'm just too much a coward\n\nTo admit when I'm in need\n\n\n\nI took a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\n\nTake a walk, 0h-oh-oh\n\nI take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nI took a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nI took a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\n\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk",
