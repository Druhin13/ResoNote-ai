  "lyrics": "Uhh\r\nYou know I come from a city of sorrow, man\r\nUgly introduction, red snow\r\nHeartaches, heartbreaks, headache, look\r\nGrowin' up it wasn't no joke, 'member all we had was hope\n\nNigga all we did was soak, no detergent, wasn't no soap\n\nI caught on to my environment, I had to, I had to grow\n\nThought she asked if could see, but she really want some smoke\n\nI've been stepped on, pushed over, pissed at, shot\n\nI've been bitch slapped, only by the police with my handcuffs\n\nI've been spit at, smell the piff' all on me, know you got it\n\nWhere that shit at?\n\nIn the back seat of the Crown, thinkin' 'bout my homie Kobe\n\nWhy you walk off from the crowd? Bro you let me down\n\n'Member mornings, I'd call you 'til you pour me up\n\nEven though I'm broke as fuck, bro know you never let me down\n\nWhy you let me down? (why you let me down?)\n\nSee me countin' all these racks, you lookin' at me now\n\nSee me fuckin' off at Sak's, in and out Maybachs\n\nMost of all ain't like these actors, lying in all they raps\n\nOoh I'm nothing like these rappers, lining all the acts\n\nI spit all the facts\n\n\n\nI put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out it's dancing\n\nI hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'\n\nI had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\nI have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\nI put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out is dancin'\n\nI hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'\n\nI had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\nI have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\n\n\nI'm that nigga' now, don't roll no Swishers now\n\nI'ma spend at least 250 when I'm gettin' high\n\n'Member drinkin' up six ounces just to get me by\n\nI stopped sippin' on the deuce, that shit wasn't gettin' me high\n\nNow I'm riding to the clip, jumpin' on G5's\n\n'Member puttin' on the 15, rollin' up three fives\n\n'Member doing shows and features, splittin' it with my guys\n\nStickin' to the G-code, didn't see nothin' wrong in my eyes\n\nI looked the devil right in the eyes and saw my niggas die\n\nCan't get caught at the light, I wrote that song and I cried\n\nI ain't emotional, you know me, that's another joint for Kobe\n\nSmokin' 50 grams of OG, 420 just for brodie\n\nI'ma wish you happy b-day, tell the world to smoke the dodi\n\nLook like everyday our birthday, Dolce, Louie, 'Sace, Balmain\n\nBitches wanna' tag alongside, your little hoe got all the jaw game\n\nShe want me to fuck it raw, gang, I ain't trying fuck at all, gang\n\n\n\nI put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out is dancing\n\nI hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'\n\nI had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\nI have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\nI put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out is dancing\n\nI hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'\n\nI had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then\n\nI have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then",
