  "lyrics": "How great the chasm that lay between us\r\nHow high the mountain I could not climb\r\nIn desperation, I turned to heaven\r\nAnd spoke Your name into the night\r\nThen through the darkness, Your loving-kindness\r\nTore through the shadows of my soul\n\nThe work is Ô¨Ånished, the end is written\n\nJesus Christ, my living hope\n\n\n\nWho could imagine so great a mercy?\n\nWhat heart could fathom such boundless grace?\n\nThe God of ages stepped down from glory\n\nTo wear my sin and bear my shame\n\nThe cross has spoken, I am forgiven\n\nThe King of kings calls me His own\n\nBeautiful Savior, I'm Yours forever\n\nJesus Christ, my living hope\n\n\n\nHallelujah, praise the One who set me free\n\nHallelujah, death has lost its grip on me\n\nYou have broken every chain\n\nThere's salvation in Your name\n\nJesus Christ, my living hope\n\n\n\nThen came the morning that sealed the promise\n\nYour buried body began to breathe\n\nOut of the silence, the Roaring Lion\n\nDeclared the grave has no claim on me\n\nThen came the morning that sealed the promise\n\nYour buried body began to breathe\n\nOut of the silence, the Roaring Lion\n\nDeclared the grave has no claim on me\n\nOh, Jesus, Yours is the victory\n\n\n\nHallelujah, praise the One who set me free\n\nHallelujah, death has lost its grip on me\n\nYou have broken every chain\n\nThere's salvation in Your name\n\nJesus Christ, my living hope\n\nHallelujah, praise the One who set me free\n\nHallelujah, death has lost its grip on me\n\nYou have broken every chain\n\nThere's salvation in Your name\n\nJesus Christ, my living hope\n\nJesus Christ, my living hope",
