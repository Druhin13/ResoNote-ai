  "lyrics": "I've paid my dues\r\nTime after time\r\nI've done my sentence\r\nBut committed no crime\r\nAnd bad mistakes\r\nI've made a few\n\nI've had my share of sand kicked in my face\n\nBut I've come through\n\n\n\nWe are the champions, my friends\n\nAnd we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end\n\nWe are the champions, we are the champions\n\nNo time for losers 'cause we are the champions...\n\nOf the world\n\n\n\nI've taken my bows\n\nAnd my curtain calls\n\nYou brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it\n\nI thank you all\n\nBut it's been no bed of roses\n\nNo pleasure cruise\n\nI consider it a challenge before the whole human race\n\nAnd I ain't gonna lose\n\n\n\nWe are the champions, my friends\n\nAnd we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end\n\nWe are the champions, we are the champions\n\nNo time for losers 'cause we are the champions...\n\nOf the world\n\nWe are the champions, my friends\n\nAnd we'll keep on fighting... 'til the end\n\nWe are the champions, we are the champions\n\nNo time for losers 'cause we are the champions...\n\nOf the world",
