  "lyrics": "I don't know what I'm scared of leaving\r\nI hope these feelings never fade\r\nI try to football, she's calling\r\nFalling, falling, falling\r\nNew love floating into my life\n\nFeels like paradise\n\n\n\nIt's something new, I can't explain it\n\nFirefly in the clouds\n\nAnd in my bedroom you're an echo\n\nFalling, falling, falling\n\n\n\nNew love floating into my life\n\nFeels like paradise\n\nNew love floating into my life\n\nFeels like paradise",
