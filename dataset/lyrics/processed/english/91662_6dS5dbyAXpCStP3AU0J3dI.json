Bring that body over here\n\n\n\nLemme show you what you missing\n\nCover you with kisses (Oh)\n\nTurn you to my Mrs\n\nAnd try every position (Never)\n\nI swear it don't get no better\n\nWith me and you and together (No)\n\nGirl, I love it\n\nHope it feels like this forever and a day (Feels like)\n\nDo you think- (Oh, oh)\n\nDo you think in the morning (Do you think in the morning)\n\nWe gon' feel the same as yesterday? (Yesterday)\n\nOr even after tomorrow (After tomorrow, yeah)\n\nHope it feels like this forever and a day\n\n\n\nI know we'll take it if one day had a turn\n\nBut I gotta let you know you stay on my mind\n\nHad a feeling you already know\n\nAnd when it comes to feelings, girl, I ain't afraid to show\n\n\n\nNow we know it ain't a secret\n\nThat I've been watching and peeping\n\nThe way you run your little games so cold\n\nBut I've been patiently waiting\n\nTo get this chance that I'm taking\n\nTo come over here and let you know\n\nI promise I ain't what these niggas on (I ain't these other niggas)\n\nNot tryna gas you up and tell you what you wanna hear (I ain't, I ain't)\n\nGirl, I'm just tryna ride the wave that you be on\n\nGirl, ain't you tired of playing? Bring that body over here\n\n\n\nLemme show you what you missing (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)\n\nCover you with kisses (Oh)\n\nTurn you to my Mrs\n\nAnd try every position (Any way you like it, babe)\n\nI swear it don't get no better (Better)\n\nWith me and you and together ('gether)\n\nGirl, I love it\n\nHope it feels like this forever and a day\n\nDo you think in the morning (Do you think in the morning, morning, morning)\n\nWe gon' feel the same as yesterday? (Yesterday)\n\nOr even after tomorrow (After tomorrow, oh babe)\n\nHope it feels like this forever and a day\n\n\n\nDo you think in the morning (Do you think in the morning, morning, morning)\n\nWe gon' feel the same as yesterday?
