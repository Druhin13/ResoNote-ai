  "lyrics": "And I don't know what we've become\r\nDon't recognise the world as one\r\nReads like a sordid affair\r\nAnd people don't know how to care\r\nThey make it up, they call it true\n\nLike hating others is something new\n\nAnd it keeps on coming round\n\nWhat a pity that he drowned\n\n\n\nAnd what do we do about it\n\nWe simply switch the channel\n\n\n\nWhat do you feel now\n\nThe world has lost its loving\n\nYou're not gonna criticise\n\nThe injustice in the world\n\nAll that we feel again\n\nA lousy sum of nothing\n\nHow do you feel now\n\nSay and look me in the eye\n\n\n\nNow I can see the medals won\n\nThey threw them on the Palace floor\n\nBut it wasn't on the news\n\nThey don't respect their views\n\n\n\nAnd what do we do about it\n\nWhen it isn't on the channel\n\n\n\nWhat do you feel now\n\nThe world has lost its loving\n\nYou're not gonna criticise\n\nThe injustice in the world\n\nAll that we feel again\n\nA lousy sum of nothing\n\nHow do you feel now\n\nSay and look me in the eye\n\n\n\nWhat do you feel now\n\nThe world has lost its loving\n\nYou're not gonna criticise\n\nThe injustice in the world\n\nAll that we feel again\n\nA lousy sum of nothing\n\nHow do you feel now\n\nSay and look me in the eye",
