  "lyrics": "Here in the city, where the sun beats down on the streets\r\nMy demons talking to me and they're just trying to eat\r\nSunset's pretty when the waves crash down on my feet\r\nAin't this life so sweet, cruising a hundred and three\r\nI'm in the fast lane, I'm moving up and\r\nIt's do or die and you can catch back up and\n\nI never slow down, just like a ghost town\n\nJames Dean, curtain call, silver screen, showdown\n\n\n\nI know you all will remember me in pages of history\n\nOh no, no, maybe we were born to die young\n\nI know you all will remember me in pages of history\n\nOh no, no, maybe we were born to die young\n\n\n\nLive fast, then we die young\n\nLive fast, then we die young\n\nWe live fast, then we die young\n\n\n\nI'd rather burn out than fade away, living day to day\n\nI was born an outcast, but who are they to say\n\nWhat I do is wrong? And I keep moving on\n\nYou might choke on these words, but you sing along\n\nSo if your heart stops or your hands tied\n\nBe the rainfall, cause a landslide\n\nAnd if they condescend, then something's wrong with them\n\nI've been off, now I'm on again\n\nI just wanna live while the feeling's there\n\nA hundred on the highway, put the top down, feel the air, kill the snare\n\nLife's a movie, we're the directors\n\nWe're the star, don't bother us, no time for the lectures\n\nMany memories I wouldn't trade for the planet\n\nLife is short, I never take it for granted\n\nGod, take me now, in the place that I'm standing\n\nI got no regret, and that's the way that I planned it\n\n\n\nI know you all will remember me in pages of history\n\nOh no, no, maybe we were born to die young\n\nI know you all will remember me in pages of history\n\nOh no, no, maybe we were born to die young\n\n\n\nLive fast, then we die young\n\nLive fast, then we die young\n\nWe live fast, then we die young\n\n\n\nIt's never been in my faith to run\n\nI was born to chase the sun\n\nMama always told me I was like no one\n\nBut I'll know when the time comes\n\nIt's never been in my faith to run\n\nI was born to chase the sun\n\nMama knew I wouldn't be here for long\n\nAnd I'll smile when the time comes\n\n\n\nI know you all will remember me in pages of history\n\nOh no, no, maybe we were born to die young\n\nI know you all will remember me in pages of history\n\nOh no, no, maybe we were born to die young\n\n\n\nLive fast, then we die young\n\nLive fast, then we die young\n\nWe live fast, then we die young",
