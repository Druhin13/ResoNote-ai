  "lyrics": "See the light from where you stand?\r\nDo you think she'll let you in?\r\nClose your eyes to be deceived\r\nStaring in eternity\r\nYou look so holy in your grace\n\nDo you feel lonely when you pray?\n\n\n\nThe end is the end\n\nThe end. The end\n\nThe end is the end\n\nThe end. The end\n\nMy friend\n\n\n\nHere's a child who holds a hand\n\nLooking up but not within\n\nCrying out for something more\n\nThere's nothing more\n\nBut don't you know there's no reward?\n\n\n\nThe end is the end\n\nThe end. The end\n\nThe end is the end\n\nThe end. The end\n\nMr friend\n\n\n\nBaptized in our own pride\n\nWe can smile but we're empty inside\n\nTelling lies just to pass time\n\nWith our sins we make water from wine\n\n\n\nThe end is the end\n\nThe end. The end\n\nThe end is the end\n\nThe end. The end\n\nMy friend, for you",
