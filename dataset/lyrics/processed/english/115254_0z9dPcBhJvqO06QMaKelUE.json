  "lyrics": "I know where you've been\r\nDon't try to act like I don't know you\r\nAnd all the words you don't hear\r\nThey always find a way back to you now\r\nSay a new day has dawned\n\nBut we no longer get to\n\nCause I know the truth\n\nThe leaves are all gone\n\nSo who's moving on?\n\nI know the worst is to come\n\n\n\nOn that Halloween you told me\n\nYou weren't drinkin\n\nI believed you\n\nNow the only time I have's to\n\nSit and wonder\n\nIf you're thinkin\n\nAbout the fun\n\nYou've had with someone else\n\nI know the truth\n\nIs wasted on you\n\n\n\nI know what you wanted\n\nUnder the lies\n\nYou take 'em and find a way\n\nTo run out the door now\n\nBack to a time that you tried to forget\n\n\n\nWhy's the music so loud\n\nTake it to the lawn now\n\nDid you think about me if I ever was to find out?\n\nCan you ease the pain with drinkin' all night?\n\nGuess you'll never know the answer if you never try\n\n\n\nOn that Halloween you told me\n\nYou weren't drinkin\n\nI believed you\n\nNow the only time I have's to\n\nSit and wonder\n\nIf you're thinkin\n\nAbout the fun\n\nYou've had with someone else\n\nI know the truth\n\nIs wasted on you\n\n\n\nYou had the choice\n\nI thought we had it made\n\nWhat's done is done\n\nWhat's left to day?\n\n\n\nI know you better\n\nI know you better now\n\nI know you better\n\nI know you better now\n\nI know you better\n\nI know you better now\n\nI know you better\n\nI know you better now",
