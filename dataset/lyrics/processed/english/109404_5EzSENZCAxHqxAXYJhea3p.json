  "lyrics": "Time and time again I find myself stuck here\r\nAnd time and time again these thoughts won't disappear\r\nWell I always tell myself that I won't let you near\r\nI won't, I won't\r\nIf it was up to me, then I would let it go\r\nBut when it comes to you, I got no self-control\n\nWell I always tell myself that I won't let it show\n\nI won't, I won't\n\nBut it's times like this that show me\n\n\n\nI can't help myself\n\nWell I guess we're both to blame\n\nYou know you're good at playing all these games\n\nAnd it's bad for my health\n\nStare at me with eager eyes\n\nI don't know why I'm acting all surprised\n\nI can't help myself\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't, I can't)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\nI can't help myself\n\n\n\nI walk into the bar and see you with your friends\n\nThe night has only started, but we both know how it ends\n\nI always say that I won't mess with you again\n\nI won't, I won't\n\nBut it's nights like this that show me\n\n\n\nI can't help myself\n\nWell I guess we're both to blame\n\nYou know you're good at playing all these games\n\nAnd it's bad for my health\n\nStare at me with eager eyes\n\nI don't know why I'm acting all surprised\n\nI can't help myself\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't, I can't)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\nI can't help myself\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't, I can't)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\nI can't help myself\n\n\n\nWell it's nights like this\n\nAnd it's times like this that show me that\n\n\n\nI can't help myself\n\nWell I guess we're both to blame\n\nYou know you're good at playing all these games, these games\n\nAnd it's bad for my health\n\nStare at me with eager eyes\n\nI don't know why I'm acting all surprised\n\nI can't help myself\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't, I can't)\n\n(Can't help myself, I can't help it)\n\nI can't help myself",
