  "lyrics": "I remember waiting for the school bus\r\nJenny Clayton was my first crush\r\nAnd neither one of us had a clue\r\nAn old Cheyenne it was my first truck\r\nRusted, rough and kinda' beat up\r\nBut when she jumped in it felt brand new\n\n\n\nAnd now these days when I drive through a small town\n\nI turn my stereo up and roll my windows down\n\n\n\nCause it reminds me of my first kiss\n\nAnd those days that I always miss\n\nAnd Tom Petty on the radio\n\nGoing steady with nowhere to go\n\nNo money, just time to spend\n\nThe old Chevy and a couple of friends\n\nOh, how I'd wish that I could go back in time\n\nJust to love you again\n\n\n\nI remember drinking from the same cup\n\nWe'd break up just to make up\n\nI remember falling in love with you\n\nSmokin' cigarettes on the tailgate\n\nMan, it seems like it was yesterday\n\nWhen Main Street felt like Park Avenue\n\n\n\nAnd when I'm driving through any old', small town\n\nI turn my stereo up and roll my windows down\n\n\n\nCause it reminds me of my first kiss\n\nAnd those times that I always miss\n\nAnd Tom Petty on the radio\n\nGoing steady with nowhere to go\n\nNo money, just time to spend\n\nAn old Chevy and a couple of friends\n\nBut, how I'd wish that I could go back in time\n\n\n\nWhen forever felt like it would never come\n\nAnd we never thought we'd turn 21\n\nSo young, we thought this could never end,\n\nOh how I'd wish we could go back again\n\nOh, yeah, yeah\n\nUh-uh-uh\n\n\n\nAnd now that time has taken over\n\nAnd we can't fight this getting older\n\nBut, somehow, baby, we made it through (we made it through)\n\nAnd every time I'm lookin' at you\n\n\n\nIt reminds me of my first kiss\n\nAnd those days I always miss\n\nAnd Tom Petty on my radio\n\nGoing steady with nowhere to go\n\nNo money, just time to spend\n\nThe old Chevy and a couple of friends\n\nOh how I'd wish that I could go back in time\n\nJust to love you again (First kiss)\n\nJust to love you again (Always miss)\n\n\n\nJust to love you again (First kiss)\n\nJust to love you again (Always miss)\n\nOh how I wish that I could go back in time",
