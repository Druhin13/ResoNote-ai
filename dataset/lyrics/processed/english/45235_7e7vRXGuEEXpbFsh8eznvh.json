  "lyrics": "We live normal lives in a normal town\r\nAnd try to make it home ‘fore the sun goes down\r\nWe do everything right by the book\r\nWe know all the rules and don’t have to look\r\nAnd that’s a good thing\n\nIt ain’t hard to get stuck in the same routine\n\nYou get caught in a rut if you know what I mean\n\nWound too tight, gotta let it unravel\n\nStep on the gas, sling a little gravel\n\nYeah, baby you and me\n\n\n\nWe’re gonna go haywire\n\nGet a little crazy maybe stay out ‘til daylight\n\nIt really don’t matter if people start thinking we ain’t right\n\nBaby sometimes you gotta go\n\nHaywire\n\n\n\nWell it’s crawfish night at the Cajun Gator\n\nWe can dance barefooted on a picnic table\n\nA little short skirt shaking your hair\n\nA drink in one hand, baby who cares\n\nThey can’t help but stare\n\n\n\nWe’re gonna go haywire\n\nGet a little crazy maybe stay out ‘til daylight\n\nIt really don’t matter if people start thinking we ain’t right\n\nBaby sometimes you gotta go\n\nHaywire\n\nWe’re gonna go haywire\n\nGet a little crazy maybe stay out ‘til daylight\n\nIt really don’t matter if people start thinking we ain’t right\n\nBaby sometimes you gotta go\n\nHaywire\n\nWe’re gonna go haywire\n\nGet a little crazy maybe stay out ‘til daylight\n\nIt really don’t matter if people start thinking we ain’t right\n\nBaby sometimes you gotta go\n\nHaywire",
