  "lyrics": "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch\r\nYou really are a heel\r\nYou're as cuddly as a cactus\r\nYou're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch\r\nYou're a bad banana with a greasy black peel\n\nYou're a monster, Mr. Grinch\n\nYour heart's an empty hole\n\nYour brain is full of spiders\n\nYou've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch\n\n\n\nYou're a vile one, Mr. Grinch\n\nYou have termites in your smile\n\nYou have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch\n\nNow given the choice between the two of you\n\nI'd take the seasick crocodile\n\nSeasick crocodile\n\n\n\nThe words that best describe you are\n\nStink, Stank, Stonk\n\nStink, Stank, Stonk\n\nOh, Mr. Grinch\n\nMr. Grinch",
