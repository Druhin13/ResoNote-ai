  "lyrics": "Did we ever know where we were going?\r\nEverytime I turn around, just another ghost\r\nMisreading every feeling\r\nYou would think I had the worst intentions\r\nIt was all fun and games but you'll never know\n\nIn clear view I could hear you\n\n\n\nOn the phone\n\nBut why should you alone?\n\nI was trying to find a reason why I'd ever let it grow\n\n(But she said)\n\n\n\nWho knew we were lightning?\n\nI saw a spark before we heard any sound to follow\n\n\n\nI think it's time I let my eyes stay open\n\nI'm missing out on the point if they're always closed\n\nSwitch focus, now I know\n\n\n\nThis is worth my time\n\nSo can you read my mind?\n\nIt says I'm tryna find a reason why to leave it all behind\n\n\n\nSo I'm out on a limb now\n\n(The path that we've been down)\n\nI fight through but somehow\n\nI hear you say\n\n\n\nWho knew we were lightning?\n\nI saw a spark before we heard any sound\n\n\n\nIf you look my way instead\n\nWe can make this permanent\n\nIs there something waiting to be found?\n\n\n\nWho knew we were?\n\n\n\nNow it's all making sense\n\nIn time we would find it\n\nI was caught in suspense\n\nBut with you I'm reminded\n\nIt's real now\n\n\n\nWho knew we were lightning?\n\nI saw a spark before we heard any sound to follow\n\n\n\nWho knew we were lightning?\n\nI saw a spark before we heard any sound\n\n\n\nIf you look my way instead\n\nWe can make this permanent\n\nIs there something waiting to be found?\n\nIs there something waiting to be found?\n\n\n\nWho knew we were?",
