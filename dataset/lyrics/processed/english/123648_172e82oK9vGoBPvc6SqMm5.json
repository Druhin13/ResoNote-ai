  "lyrics": "Life is so simple\r\nA little boy, a little girl\r\nLaughing and loving\r\nTrying to figure out the world\r\nIt felt like summer\r\nWhen I kissed you in the rain\n\nAnd I know your story\n\nBut tell me again\n\n\n\nNothing you said wouldn't interest me\n\nAll of your words are like poems to me\n\nI would be honored if you would take me as I am\n\n\n\nI want you to look right in my eyes\n\nTo tell me you love me, to be by my side\n\nI want you at the end of my life\n\nI wanna see your face, when I fall with grace\n\nAt the moment I die\n\nIs that alright?\n\nIs that alright?\n\n\n\nI hope you’re still with me when I’m not quite myself\n\nAnd I pray that you’ll lift me when you know I need help\n\nIt’s a warm celebration of all of our years\n\nI dream of our story, of our fairy tale\n\n\n\nFamily dinners and family trees\n\nTeaching the kids to say thank you and please\n\nKnow that if we stay together that things will be right\n\n\n\nI want you to look right in my eyes\n\nTo tell me you love me, to be by my side\n\nI want you at the end of my life\n\nI wanna see your face, when I fall with grace\n\nAt the moment I die\n\nIs that alright?\n\nIs that alright?\n\nIs that alright?",
