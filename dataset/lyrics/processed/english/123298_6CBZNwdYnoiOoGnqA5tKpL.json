  "lyrics": "I was waiting on my chariot to steal me away\r\nWishing on stars and fairy dust and running low on faith\r\nYeah, the way that I saw it, my true love would come calling\r\nTossing pebbles at the window of my ivory tower\r\nI was looking for roses, oh, but how would I know that\r\nLove's a little closer to a wildflower?\n\n\n\nI'd been waiting on a white horse (Oh, oh)\n\nTo take me away on a sunset ride\n\nBut you showed up on a dark horse (Oh, oh)\n\nAt the Cinderella midnight, just in time\n\nMaybe not the way I was dreaming of\n\nBut you rode in and won my love\n\nAnd now I'm finally on the right course (Oh, oh)\n\nWho needs a white horse?\n\n\n\nWoah-oh, woah\n\nWoah-oh, woah\n\n\n\nI like the way you came out of the blue\n\nAnd took me by surprise\n\nYou make me feel like I'm a mystery to you\n\nAnd not some kind of prize\n\n\n\nI'd been waiting on a white horse (Oh, oh)\n\nTo take me away on a sunset ride\n\nBut you showed up on a dark horse (Oh, oh)\n\nAt the Cinderella midnight, just in time\n\nMaybe not the way I was dreaming of\n\nBut you rode in and won my love\n\nAnd now I'm finally on the right course (Oh, oh)\n\nYeah, who needs a white horse?\n\n\n\nWoah-oh, woah\n\n(Woah-oh, oh)\n\nWoah-oh, woah, oh yeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah (Woah-oh, oh)\n\n\n\nOh, the way that I saw it, my true love would come calling\n\nTossing pebbles at the window of my ivory tower\n\nI was looking for roses, oh, but how would I know that\n\nLove's a little closer to a wildflower?\n\nTo a wildflower\n\n\n\nI'd been waiting on a white horse\n\nOh, to take me away on a sunset ride\n\nBut you showed up on a dark horse\n\nAt the Cinderella midnight, just in time\n\nMaybe not the way I was dreaming of\n\nBut you rode in and won my love\n\nAnd now I'm finally on the right course (Oh, oh)\n\nYeah, who needs a white horse?\n\n\n\nHey, hey yeah, yeah\n\nMm-mm, oh\n\nWoah-oh, woah, oh, oh\n\n(Woah-oh, oh)",
