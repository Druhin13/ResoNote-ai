  "lyrics": "Here I stand\r\nGoing through the motions with the mic in my hand\r\nPlaying hard to get, pretending like I understand\r\nJust a fool getting by\r\nJust a fool doing alright\n\nOut getting loaded, only way away from the pain I guess?\n\nHolding me so tightly will it ever let me rest?\n\nMemorize the lines and try to work within the frame\n\nBusting out the glass, bloody knuckles broke the pain\n\n\n\nJust a fool getting by\n\nJust a fool doing alright\n\nJust a fool getting by\n\nJust a fool doing alright\n\nJust a fool, just a fool\n\n\n\nOut on the street\n\nBleeding in the gutter, busting out the teeth\n\nSpoke my mind, wound up on the wrong side of the fence\n\nMade another promise that should have never left my lips\n\nNow I'm wasting away behind the bars of this country cage\n\nNowhere else to turn and try to quiet down my rage\n\nThinking about the ones who did just what they always said\n\nTrying to find the strength it takes to become one of them\n\nWorking for the man and dreaming of the day\n\nThat I'm throwing down the hammer and marching my own way\n\n\n\nJust a fool getting by\n\nJust a fool doing alright\n\nJust a fool getting by\n\nJust a fool doing alright\n\nAnd dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight\n\nJust a fool, just a fool\n\nJust a fool, just a fool",
