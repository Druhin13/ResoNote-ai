  "lyrics": "Oh, I'm the lucky one\r\nBorn in a white tuxe, live like a king dove, summer sun\r\nOh, I'm the buried seed\r\nWhite on the tight rope, pain is a cycle\r\nDon't you see how it repeats?\n\nBombs a mess\n\nSometimes the devil got the sweetest kiss\n\n\n\nOh, will you ever make it out, son?\n\nWill you ever make it out, son?\n\nAre you a sucker or a lucky one?\n\nAre you a sucker or a lucky one?\n\nA lucky one\n\n\n\nOh, I'm a piece of dirt\n\nCaught in a spiral, dead on arrival, make it hurt\n\nOh, I'm a tragic man\n\nLove is a card game, head filled with heartache\n\nIt's all a part of the plan\n\n\n\nGuns they stall\n\nSometimes the devil got the sweetest call\n\n\n\nOh, will you ever make it out, son?\n\nWill you ever make it out, son?\n\nAre you a sucker or a lucky one?\n\nAre you a sucker or a lucky one?\n\nA lucky one\n\n\n\nI want a million bucks, I wanna fly to mars\n\nI wanna die for love, I wanna touch the stars\n\nI wanna finish first, I wanna make my place\n\nI wanna move the earth, I wanna make it shake\n\nI wanna be your boss, don't wanna sell my soul\n\nI wanna take it off, I wanna have control\n\nI wanna have control, control\n\nI wanna be the lucky one\n\n\n\nBombs a mess\n\nSometimes the devil got the sweetest kiss\n\n\n\nOh, will you ever make it out, son?\n\nWill you ever make it out, son?\n\nAre you a sucker or a lucky one?\n\nAre you a sucker or a lucky one?\n\nA lucky one",
