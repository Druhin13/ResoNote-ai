OUT\r\nI been sad, I been tryna get a grip\r\nI been getting mad at shit that don’t make sense to me\r\nIf only you knew about my brain and everything that goes through it\n\nDaydream about all the sex and the ritual sacrifice I could commit\n\nThrowing your heart to Amitt\n\n\n\nKill the machines\n\nWatching your world fall apart at the seams\n\nWhat if they learned to breathe?\n\nUpload my consciousness when I’m deceased\n\nAround my neck, rep the crest, till I take a rest\n\nTrying to avoid droid ploys, won’t escape N/O/I/S/E\n\n\n\nStuck. In. My. Mind\n\nGET. ME. OUT\n\n\n\n(Find a safe place)\n\n\n\nGET. ME. OUT",
