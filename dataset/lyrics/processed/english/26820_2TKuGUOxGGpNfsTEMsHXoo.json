  "lyrics": "Stay alert, look alive, that's the ritual\r\nDon't get ate up by the same blocks that get you full\r\nEither them boys had to meet quota\r\nOr got your name on a sheet inside of a neat folder\r\nThis time a year n's do wil' out\r\nThey go crazy tryin' to shine\n\nBuying 9mm, eyeing mine\n\nSome see that minimum wage allows very few to eat\n\nFor they kids, they engage then get married to the street\n\nFind theyself addicted to the lovin' that they kill for\n\nThat brings the dollar bill or\n\nBags from the Tommy Hill store\n\nWatch out!\n\nThey already racial profilin'\n\nSo when the streets talk, hope is at a low volume\n\nYoung boy lost his freedom just to get respect from it\n\nCouldn't tell a gut feeling from a upset stomach\n\nWas it justified for a good for nothing reason?\n\n\n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season\n\nWatch out for Johnny Law\n\nWatch out for Five-o\n\nWatch out for Babylon\n\nWatch out for Popo\n\nWatch out for One-Time\n\nWatch out for Narco\n\nWatch out for Flat Foot\n\nWatch out for Slow Roll\n\nWas it justified for a good for nothing reason?\n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season \n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season\n\nWatch out for Johnny Law\n\nWatch out for Five-o\n\nWatch out for Babylon\n\nWatch out for Popo\n\nWatch out for One-Time\n\nWatch out for Narco\n\nWatch out for Flat Foot\n\nWatch out for Slow Roll\n\nWas it justified for a good for nothing reason?\n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season \n\n\n\nDon't fall in love with the prezies like young Leslie and\n\nThe city of crooks, she's a lesbian\n\nOnly hit the club for a fool she later set up\n\nPlay cool, so when she spray tools, he later wet up [?]\n\nRemoved his chain, found his wallet, and then she stole both\n\nShorty ain't just out for the bread, she want the whole loaf\n\n'Cause money talks with a silver tongue\n\nMake you think your want is your need\n\nLike cars with the speed, weed to fill your lungs, or what the pill young mind states who turn savage\n\nWho have rich personalities but earn average\n\nWatch out!\n\nThat's if you got your watch out\n\nAt the right time\n\nIn the wrong place where you do not belong\n\nTaste your own blood from thugs\n\nThat bust slugs with heaters and mugs\n\nBy crooked police that plant drugs\n\nActing like they found a cigar, you were stuffing treason\n\n'Cause\n\n\n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season\n\nWatch out for Johnny Law\n\nWatch out for Five-o\n\nWatch out for Babylon\n\nWatch out for Popo\n\nWatch out for One-Time\n\nWatch out for Narco\n\nWatch out for Flat Foot\n\nWatch out for Slow Roll\n\nWas it justified for a good for nothing reason?\n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season \n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season\n\nWatch out for Johnny Law\n\nWatch out for Five-o\n\nWatch out for Babylon\n\nWatch out for Popo\n\nWatch out for One-Time\n\nWatch out for Narco\n\nWatch out for Flat Foot\n\nWatch out for Slow Roll\n\nWas it justified for a good for nothing reason?\n\nWhen them streets turn cold on you, it's cuffin' season",
