We poppingʼ like it or not\n\nYeah weʼre going up. weʼre going up. weʼre going up, weʼre going up!\n\nTell your people to hit my people just google me\n\nThe second youʼll get into some musical ingenuity\n\nWatch me take it from google beach to a nudie beach\n\nOverseas especially if Iʼm counting the streams\n\nYour daughter and her homies come to every single show Iʼm reppin\n\nYour mama be bumping me in the whip and you still wonʼt cut the check\n\nWe could all be one happy family, but\n\nYouʼre too cool for school\n\n\n\n(Planes)",
