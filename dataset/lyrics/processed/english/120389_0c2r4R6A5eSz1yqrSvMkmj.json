  "lyrics": "If I could keep you safe, in the top shelf of my heart\r\nThe world is full of hate\r\nSo I loved you from the start\r\nWhen it's cold outside\r\nWhen your bones are tired\r\nI will carry you\n\nI wanna keep you safe\n\nIn the top shelf of my heart\n\n\n\nI wanna keep you safe\n\nIn the top shelf of my heart\n\n\n\nThrow my fears, right on your table\n\nFor all my flaws\n\nBe forever grateful\n\nEvery single road that you're gonna cross\n\nI'm telling you to hold onto what you got\n\nEmbrace the wind\n\nAnd you will sail\n\n\n\nIf I could keep you safe, in the top shelf of my heart\n\nI wanna keep you safe\n\nIn the top shelf of my heart\n\n\n\nWhen you wake up\n\nKnow that I'll be there\n\nSome day your spirit\n\nI'll be your air\n\nWhen it's cold outside\n\nWhen your bones are tired\n\nI will carry you\n\nI wanna keep you safe\n\nIn the top shelf of my heart",
