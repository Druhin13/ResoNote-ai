  "lyrics": "Suicidal like who am I, though\r\nI fucking hate you that's my newest motto\r\nI can choose the change but I choosed the bottle\r\nIf I'll fall asleep I'll see a new tomorrow\r\nYeah\n\nCause you don't feel the pain that I've been feeling inside\n\nI'm fucking losing my mind\n\n\n\nThey're lookin' at me like I shotted the Sheriff\n\nCause I got too drunk and I'm not embarrassed\n\nBut I've been depressed and that's not apparent\n\nUnless I say it out loud, so they all can hear it\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nAnd I don't wanna seem like all I want is attention\n\nYou seem to think I'm pretendin'\n\n\n\nNow all I see is these shots of glass\n\nSo I walk in the bar and I start a tab\n\nI got a soft soul but the hardest past\n\nTell the waiter upfront they can call me a cab\n\nI'm a hypocrite and insomniac\n\nI'm a piece of shit but I honor that\n\nI got mental problems and it's got me mad\n\nBut you seem to think that they are not that bad\n\nAs I think they are\n\nWhat kind of Cole is that?\n\nYou don't know what it's like\n\nYou ain't thought to ask\n\nBut you ain't me and you never will be\n\nThe devil inside was sent to kill me\n\nIf you really care I expect the real thing\n\nI feel they will never get the message\n\nWill they?\n\nIt's all good, I won't give up my hopes\n\nI am drunk as fuck but I think I'm sober\n\n\n\nI been all alone lately\n\nFeel like I might go crazy\n\nI must the only one that feels this way\n\nLock up all the doors, baby\n\nDisconnect the phone, baby\n\nBlock out all the noise and I might be okay\n\nJust let me have my moment\n\nI really need my moment\n\nI gotta have my moment\n\nI really need my moment\n\nI need a moment of silence\n\n\n\nI found a bottle back in grade seven\n\nA young desperado, I had to make effort\n\nMy foot's on the gas, not the break pedal\n\nI just put on ice, so it tastes better, yeah\n\n\n\nI guess I'm just confused 'cause I see all the potential\n\nBut lately I'm going mental, I don't know what to do\n\n\n\nWho would thought that I'd get this nervous\n\nThe life style that I leads not picture perfect\n\nThe hear what I say but they miss the purpose\n\nPour the shot in my glass 'til I hit the surface\n\nThat hotter inside I should leave the curtains\n\nBut today I just feel like a different person\n\nI keep tellin' myself that it isn't urgent\n\nIf you dig what I'm sayin' you should feel my words then\n\n\n\nIt's obvious to me that I'm the root of the issue\n\nDon't make me use it against you\n\nCause I will\n\n\n\nCause when it back fire, it just disappear\n\nI'm way too anxious, I live in fear\n\nI see it from a far and it's crystal clear\n\nBut know the objects closer than it appears\n\n\n\nWhen I'm fucked up I feel okay\n\nBut the next morning there's no way\n\nThat I could feel good and it's so strange\n\nTil I do it all again and it go away\n\nI don't need friends, I got hose\n\nAnd it's in red cup and it's O.J\n\nIt's what it's, it will take a while\n\nSo I shake these hands and I fake the smile\n\n\n\nI been all alone lately\n\nFeel like I might go crazy\n\nI must the only one that feels this way\n\nLock up all the doors, baby\n\nDisconnect the phone, baby\n\nBlock out all the noise and I might be okay\n\nJust let me have my moment\n\nI really need my moment\n\nI gotta have my moment\n\nI really need my moment\n\nI need a moment of silence",
