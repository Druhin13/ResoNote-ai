  "lyrics": "If you're running through the hours feeling out of touch\r\nGather all your cares and leave ’em in the dust\r\nWhen you could use a win instead of losing all your luck\r\nYou can find your strength by never giving up\r\nYou're gold, told you so\n\nYou're gold, don’t you know?\n\n\n\nIf you're feeling broken with your head in your hands\n\nIf you believe you can\n\nYou're halfway there\n\nYou're halfway there\n\nRemember when life ain't goin' the way that you planned\n\nIf you believe you can\n\nYou're halfway there\n\nYou're halfway there\n\nYou’re halfway there\n\n\n\nYou’re halfway there\n\nYou're halfway there\n\nYou’re halfway there",
