  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson It Happened Quiet par Aurora\r\nEyes blue and hollow\nAs it rains against their will\nFeathers falling out of a pillow\nAs if time's standing still\n\nI can’t remember much more\nBut I know it happened quiet\nSo quiet\n\nWords falling out through the window\nAll that remains is a silent call\nIs the earth colored red?\nAs I land like a flower on the meadow\nLove is wild\n\nAnd you fell apart\n\nLike a stone can be broken into sand\nOne thousand pieces\nSpread across a dying land\n\nAnd you can’t remember that day\nBut you know it happened quiet\nSo quiet\n\nWords falling out through the window\nAll that remains is a silent call\nIs the earth colored red?\nAs I land like a flower on the meadow\nLove is wild\n\nAre your dreams as dead as they seem?\nAre your dreams as dead as they seem?\n\nDon’t you speak over my voice\n\nI will return from the shadows\nAnd I’ll bleed in your bed\nTurn it red\nLike the ground outside your window\nLove is wild\n\nLove is wild\nLove is wild\nOh, love is wild",
