  "lyrics": "My heart is spilling over\r\nCrashing on the ground\r\nI can't see what's around me\r\nBut soon I'll come round\r\nMy faith is in the balance\n\nOf a million tiny words\n\nSo I return to silence\n\n\n\nAnd if I see a sign in the sky tonight\n\nNo one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light\n\nMay never come but I'm willing to wait\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a man of the faith\n\nAnd there's an ocean in my body\n\nAnd there's a river in my soul\n\nAnd I'm crying\n\n\n\nIt's time that I let go\n\nOf things I can't control\n\nThis path that I've taken\n\nIs the only one I know\n\n\n\nWell I've come so far to get here\n\nAnd I've got so far to go\n\nSo I'll take what I can get\n\nIn matters of the soul\n\n\n\nAnd if I see a sign in the sky tonight\n\nNo one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light\n\nMay never come but I'm willing to wait\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a man of the faith\n\nAnd there's an ocean in my body\n\nAnd there's a river in my soul\n\nAnd I'm crying\n\n\n\nAnd we are the dawn\n\nAnd we carry the sun\n\nAnd we are the dawn\n\nAnd we carry the sun\n\n\n\nAnd if I see a sign in the sky tonight\n\nNo one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light\n\nMay never come but I'm willing to wait\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a man of the faith\n\nAnd there's an ocean in my body\n\nAnd there's a river in my soul\n\nAnd I'm crying\n\n\n\nAnd if I see a sign in the sky tonight (See it coming)\n\nNo one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light (Feel it coming)\n\nMay never come but I'm willing to wait\n\nWhat can I say? I'm a man of the faith\n\nAnd there's an ocean in my body\n\nAnd there's a river in my soul\n\nAnd I'm crying",
