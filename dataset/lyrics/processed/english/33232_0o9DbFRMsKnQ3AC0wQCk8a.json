  "lyrics": "He's always on the main selling draws in the rain\r\nHe spent a mortgage on chains, these niggas use their apps more than their brains, lets go\r\nHow can I wife away my cousin?\r\nHit it broke bitches walking round, Louis bags nothing in it\r\nKilling all that bullshit that you see on the news\r\nAnd what they teach in the schools has got the peoples confused\n\nAll these fake niggas acting like they love me\n\nShe looks pretty but her personality's ugly\n\nI can't stop trapping till I got about eight figures\n\nI ain't antisocial, just can't be around these fake niggas\n\nI just can't understand it, how you mock a foreign nigga's accent\n\nOnly speak one language\n\nI coulda copped a thousand Red Bottoms but I'm on my grind\n\nTrackie and some Nikes is what I'm walking these blocks in\n\nNowadays they judge you by your status, your cars and your trainers\n\nYour clothes, but, I was born naked\n\nIt's Nines\n\n\n\nI don't know how I should feel\n\nAre you friend or you foe? Are you fake or you real?\n\nIt's ... it's like it's all a reverse\n\nGirls are acting like man, and man are acting like girls\n\nAite ... I ain't tweeting these hoes\n\nI got a dream of my own, that's why I'm sleeping alone\n\nI want a girl that I can reason with\n\nBut it's like I'm looking for my rock inside a sea full of stones\n\n\n\nCopped my first Q, knew one day I'll take over\n\nWho am I? I got my surname from a slave owner\n\nFlying birds, bussing guns, that's the life we chose\n\nNiggas sleep on good girls, wife these hoes\n\nI've never been around these rappers and they had my burner\n\nCan't style on me bitch, your man's a worker\n\nI just made 100k and I ain't paid tax\n\nAll the kids whip now so I just sell yay packs\n\nMy nigga got the potent, said he need some P\n\nI told him Cash got 30 fam at least you're free\n\nOn the strip with the akhis but they don't know 'bout deen\n\nIt must be karma the way that bitch sold me a dream\n\nMy nigga calling my worker to get through to me\n\nBut I can't speak cause that nigga rang me out last week\n\nI got nicked for some bud, then they threw me in the can\n\nWonder why I still grind? 'Cah I do it for the fam\n\nIt's Nines",
