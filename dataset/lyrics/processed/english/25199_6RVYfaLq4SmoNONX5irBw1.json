  "lyrics": "Oh, take my bones to build yourself a castle to roam\r\nAnd oh, take my eyes to see inside the heaven I stole\r\nBut hell, it's cold out and I can't sleep tonight\r\nBut hell, it's cold out, I need you by my side\n\nGoing head to head\n\nIs that how we're gonna love?\n\nGoing head to head\n\nIs that how we're gonna love?\n\nNo one can touch me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\nNobody hurts me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\n\n\nOh, let me in, your doors are made for thieves like me\n\nAnd oh, my skin goes flush when I think of your touch\n\n\n\nBut hell, it's cold out and I can't sleep tonight\n\nBut hell, it's cold out, I need you by my side\n\n\n\nGoing head to head\n\nIs that how we're gonna love?\n\nGoing head to head\n\nIs that how we're gonna love?\n\nNo one can touch me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\nNobody hurts me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\n\n\nBreak my heart like I know you want to, like I know you want to\n\nWith your hands, hold my ruby red lips like a punch and a kiss\n\nBreak my heart, break my heart\n\n\n\nGoing head to head\n\nIs that how we're gonna love?\n\nGoing head to head\n\nIs that how we're gonna love?\n\nNo one can touch me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\nNobody hurts me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\n\n\nNo one can touch me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you\n\nNobody hurts me like you do\n\nLove it but only from you",
