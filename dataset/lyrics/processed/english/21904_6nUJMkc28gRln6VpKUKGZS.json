  "lyrics": "Why can't you live without knowing I'm bleeding out?\r\nYou want the worst for me so tear me down\r\nOn the edge, I'm ready for the end of everything\r\nThat you've got planned to make life hell\r\nWith every little thing that you say or do\n\n\n\nThe loneliness, I can't wait to feel it\n\nAnd what Iâ€™d give to burn down the bridge\n\n\n\nSlowly breaking free\n\nJust let me count the times, count the times\n\nThat I paid for your every lie, every lie\n\nWhen's it gonna end this time around?\n\nSo tear me down\n\nI guess that's what it takes for you to feel alive at all\n\n\n\nYour voice I'm drowning out\n\nCan't hear you screaming now\n\nYou've done your worst to me so I can take it now, take it now\n\n\n\nTake away every single feeling eating me alive\n\nAnd let me live without feelings that you made me suffer through\n\n\n\nThe bitterness, I begin to feel it\n\nAnd your last breath, what I'd give to see it\n\n\n\nBreak free\n\nWhat I'd give to feel it\n\nBreak free\n\nEveryone will know it\n\n\n\nSlowly breaking free\n\nJust let me count the times, count the times\n\nThat I paid for your every lie, every lie\n\nWhen's it gonna end this time around?\n\nSo tear me down\n\nI guess that's what it takes for you to feel alive at all\n\n\n\nCall my name and I'm sure to leave you out for dead\n\nI don't fucking need you\n\n\n\nBreak free\n\nWhat I'd give to feel it\n\nBreak free\n\nEveryone will know it\n\n\n\nJust let me count the times, count the times\n\nThat I paid for your every lie, every lie\n\nWhen's it gonna end this time around?\n\nSo tear me down\n\nI guess that's what it takes for you to feel alive at all",
