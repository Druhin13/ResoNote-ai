  "lyrics": "I wished I was smarter\r\nI wished I was stronger\r\nI wished I loved Jesus\r\nThe way my wife does\r\nI wish it had been easier\r\nInstead of any longer\n\nI wished I could have stood where you would have been proud\n\nBut that won't happen now\n\nThat won't happen now\n\n\n\nThere's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard\n\nDisappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow\n\nThink I broke the wings off that little song bird\n\nShe's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now\n\nTop of the world\n\n\n\nI don't have to answer any of these questions\n\nDon't have no God to teach me no lessons\n\nI come home in the evening\n\nSit in my chair\n\nOne night they called me for supper\n\nBut I never got up\n\nI stayed right there in my chair\n\n\n\nThere's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard\n\nDisappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow\n\nThink I broke the wings off that little song bird\n\nShe's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now\n\n\n\nI wished I'd a known you\n\nWished I'd a shown you\n\nAll of the things I was on the inside\n\nI'd pretend to be sleeping\n\nWhen you come in in the morning\n\nTo whisper good-bye\n\nGo to work in the rain\n\nI don't know why\n\nDon't know why\n\n\n\n'Cause everyone's singing\n\nWe just wanna be heard\n\nDisappearing everyday without so much as a word somehow\n\nWanna grab a hold of that little song bird\n\nTake her for a ride to the top of the world right now\n\n\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world\n\nTo the top of the world",
