  "lyrics": "First off, \"I hate you.\"\r\nThe words cut through her lips like a Japanese knife\r\nShe didn't expect to be hearing this tonight\r\nMeanwhile, I hear it all happening\r\nThrough the door\r\nOn the phone in the next room\n\nYeah I'm listening to you\n\n\n\nShe said I can't wait, I can't wait til there's no soreness in my arms\n\nAnd I can't wait, I can't wait, til there's no scar across my heart\n\nI'm sick of being your trashbag baby, wanna see you fall down\n\nI can't wait, I can't wait, until you're not around\n\n\n\nMy heart breaks, it shatters\n\nI spend all of June trying to pick up the shards\n\nOh yeah, oh no, I should have known better\n\nBut I'm not bitter\n\nMy hand hurts, it's blistered\n\nSo don't grab it\n\nCoz she'll fuckin' stab you\n\nIt's true!\n\nWhen will you stop playing with fire?\n\nWell I don't know\n\n\n\nShe said I can't wait, I can't wait til there's no soreness in my arms\n\nAnd I can't wait, I can't wait, til there's no scar across my heart\n\nI'm sick of being your trashbag baby, wanna see you fall down\n\nI can't wait, I can't wait, until you're not around\n\n\n\nI can't wait, I can't wait for you anymore (repeated)\n\nI'm sick of being your trashbag baby, wanna see you fall down\n\nI can't wait, I can't wait, until you're not around\n\n\n\nShe said I can't wait, I can't wait til there's no soreness in my arms\n\nAnd I can't wait, I can't wait, til there's no scar across my heart\n\nI'm sick of being your trashbag baby, wanna see you fall down\n\nI can't wait, I can't wait, until you're not around",
