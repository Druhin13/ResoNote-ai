  "lyrics": "It came upon the midnight clear\r\nThat glorious song of old\r\nFrom angels bending near the earth\r\nTo touch their harps of gold\r\nStill through the cloven skies they come\n\nWith peaceful wings unfurled\n\nAnd still their heavenly music floats\n\nO'er all the weary world:\n\n\"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men\n\nFrom heaven's all-gracious King\"\n\nThe world in solemn stillness lay\n\nTo hear the angels sing\n\n\n\nAngels we have heard on high\n\nSweetly singing o'er the plains\n\nAnd the mountains in reply\n\nEchoing their joyous strains:\n\n\"Peace on the earth, goodwill to men\n\nFrom heaven's all-gracious King\"\n\nThe world in solemn stillness lay\n\nTo hear the angels sing\n\n\n\nGloria, in excelsis Deo\n\nGloria, in excelsis Deo\n\n\n\nOh, hear the angels sing",
