  "lyrics": "Somewhere, lost in pieces I will find my heart again\r\nAnd as the days pass\r\nAnd you float away every scars you left start to fade\r\nAnd I'm calling, calling, calling out\r\nI'm falling, falling, falling down\r\nI'm calling, calling, calling aloud to night\n\nCause it's over, over now\n\nI can finally find the air to breathe\n\nCause I'm rising off the ground\n\nI can finally find the air to breathe Find the air to breathe\n\nAnd I'm calling, calling, calling out\n\nI'm falling, falling, falling down I'm calling, calling, calling\n\nI'm falling, falling, falling down\n\nSomewhere, lost in pieces I will find my heart again\n\nAnd as the days pass\n\nAnd you float away every scars you left start to fade\n\nCause it's over, over now\n\nI can finally find the air to breathe\n\nCause I'm rising off the ground\n\nI can finally find the air to breathe Find the air to breathe\n\nCause it's over, over now\n\nI can finally find the air to breathe\n\nCause I'm rising off the ground\n\nI can finally find the air to breathe Find the air to breathe .",
