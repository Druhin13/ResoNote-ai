  "lyrics": "Don't you feel the need for change?\r\nThe light have died in our eyes\r\nThe hatred will consume us\r\nLet's free ourselves from the ties\r\nDeep inside we pray for the flood\n\nA cure to wash it away\n\nBeen bound to vicious circles\n\nIgnoring the price we have to pay\n\n\n\nI've been searching, I feel worthless\n\n(Have to pay)\n\nI've been searching, I feel worthless\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\nRunning through the flames\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\nRelease me from your games\n\n\n\nToo easy to say, too easy to hate\n\nNever make the same mistakes\n\nWhere I'm going I couldn't care\n\nBut for you this is where it ends\n\n\n\nI've been searching, I feel worthless\n\n(Where it ends)\n\nI've been searching, I feel worthless\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\nRunning through the flames\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\nRelease me from your games\n\n\n\nThe light have died\n\nDied in our eyes\n\nFree ourselves\n\nFrom the ties\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\nThe lies we try to tell\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\nRelease me from your spell\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\n(The lies we try to tell)\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\n(We retract to our cell)\n\n\n\nHolding out for something new\n\nRunning through the flames\n\nBroken dreams and heartbreak\n\nRelease me from your games\n\nRelease me from your games",
