Just come back to me \n\n(Lonely) \n\nYes baby my heart is lonely \n\n(Lonely) \n\nMy heart hurts baby \n\n(Lonely) \n\nYes I feel pain too \n\nBaby please \n\nThis time instead just come to my bed \n\nAnd baby just don't let me go \n\n\n\nAlthough we've come to the End Of The Road \n\nStill I can't let you go \n\nIt's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you \n\nCome to the End of the Road \n\nStill I can't let you go \n\nIt's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you \n\n\n\nAlthough we've come to the End Of The Road \n\nStill I can't let you go \n\nIt's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you \n\nCome to the End of the Road \n\nStill I can't let you go \n\nIt's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you",
