  "lyrics": "You are the only one that I feel I can talk to\r\nThese late night moods\r\nI want you near\r\nAnything but to be alone\r\nAlone\r\nAlone\n\nDark Matter\n\nOf course I noticed when you walked in\n\nYou sat down next to me and I got nervous\n\nNext to you, I'm the only one\n\nNext to you, I'm the only one\n\nGravity pulling harm together\n\nTwo people never got it right\n\nConfigure and disassemble\n\nCause aren't we just trying to survive?\n\nListen, maybe you’ll hear why this can’t continue\n\nI'm done with this fantasy even if you don't believe me\n\nYou know I've tried to explain myself but the only word you'll listen to is ‘nothing’ (nothing, nothing)\n\nNothing, silence, chaos in your mind\n\nIt's all for something\n\nBelieve me this time\n\nIf I could just for once forget about you\n\nThe prodigy of my distant days\n\nFor all I know, claiming the worst of all of me\n\nDark matter, the dagger drives deeper\n\nIn the daylight, in the moonlight, 'drives deeper\n\nAll this dark matter, claiming all that’s left of me",
