  "lyrics": "I wasn't raised in a castle\r\nI grew up on the outskirts of town\r\nNo dresses with golden tassels\r\nThe rings on my hand are handed down\r\nBut I'm gonna find the one that needs me, see's me\n\nAnd treats me like I'm already royalty\n\nThere ain't nothing priceless on my wrist\n\nI might not fly private, but that don't mean I ain't a queen\n\n\n\nQueens don't hate, queens don't fight\n\nQueens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh\n\nEvery jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it\n\nWon't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it\n\nNo, queens ain't fake\n\nA queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh\n\nI ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne\n\nSome girls might, but queen's don't\n\n\n\nNo, I don't need the tallest tower\n\nTo prove to anyone I ain't weak\n\nI turn my pain into power\n\nEvery tear's a diamond on my cheek\n\n\n\nQueens don't hate, queens don't fight\n\nQueens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh\n\nEvery jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it\n\nWon't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it\n\nNo, queen's ain't fake\n\nA queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh\n\nI ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne\n\nSome girls might, but queen's don't\n\n\n\nQueens dont break, they just get stronger\n\nThere ain't nothing they can't conquer\n\n\n\nQueens don't hate, queens don't fight\n\nQueens don't stay unless their king treats her right, oh\n\nEvery jewel on my crown, you better believe I earned it\n\nWon't keep people around that don't believe I deserve it\n\nNo, queen's ain't fake\n\nA queen's gonna rule just the way she was made, oh\n\nI ain't 'bout to let nobody come and take me off this throne\n\nSome girls might, but queen's don't",
