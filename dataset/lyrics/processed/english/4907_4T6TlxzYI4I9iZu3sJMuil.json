  "lyrics": "Judy never asked her for forever\r\nJudy never asked her for the moon\r\nJudy knew that loving her was better\r\nAnd no one knew her heart like Judy\r\nJudy’s never mentioned in the papers\n\nJudy’s never noted in the news\n\nJudy knew that loving her was safer\n\nLoving from the red side of the moon\n\n\n\nLoving you from the red side of the moon\n\nLoving her was funnier than a Saturday cartoon\n\nSomeday is a story and it’s the one I’m sticking to\n\nLoving from the red side of the moon\n\n\n\nJudy grew up stepping right beside her\n\nLoved her from the cover of the crowds\n\nJudy’s heart was beating right beside her\n\nEven with the music loud and\n\n\n\nJudy’s never minded all the waiting\n\nJudy never thought to watch the clock\n\nJudy knew that loving’s in the patience\n\nWhen the red side of the moon is what we’ve got\n\n\n\nLoving you from the red side of the moon\n\nLoving her was easier than a Kristofferson tune\n\nSomeday is a story and it’s the one I’m sticking to\n\nLoving from the red side of the moon\n\n\n\nJudy left her best days in Chicago\n\nJudy had her worst days in the rain\n\nMiddle of the winter with so far to go\n\nAnd she couldn’t keep on hitching to that train\n\n\n\nAnd she still listens to the radio\n\nLate night after midnight she tunes in\n\nSings along to songs and every word she knows\n\nRemembering when the moon was burning red\n\n\n\nLoving you from the red side of the moon\n\nLoving her was heavier than a leaded red balloon\n\nSomeday is a story and it’s the one I’m sticking to\n\nLoving from the red side of the moon",
