  "lyrics": "Laying in the bed that I made all alone\r\nGuess I'm not surprised honestly\r\nPraying in my head that you stayed and I hope\r\nYou'll miss me eventually\r\nPeople wanna talk when I'm not around to hear\n\nReally they don't know what I'm made of\n\nPeople keep on walking so far away from here\n\nClearly I'm the one they're afraid of\n\n\n\nOne after another, they've always come and gone\n\nSo what if I'm a monster that's been here all along\n\nThey're dropping like flies whenever I'm around\n\nSo used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound\n\nMaybe I'm the monster that's been here all along\n\n\n\nBending 'till you break and you can't take anymore\n\nI'm not worth the trouble it seems\n\nI would say you're wrong, but I've been here before\n\nYou won't be the last one to leave\n\n\n\nPeople wanna talk when I'm not around to hear\n\nReally they don't know what I'm made of\n\nPeople keep on walking so far away from here\n\nClearly I'm the one they're afraid of\n\n\n\nOne after another, they've always come and gone\n\nSo what if I'm a monster that's been here all along\n\nThey're dropping like flies whenever I'm around\n\nSo used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound\n\nMaybe I'm the monster that's been here all along\n\n\n\nYou're safe here\n\nNo need to run and hide\n\nUnderneath your cover now\n\nDon't be scared\n\nThere's nothing left inside\n\nSince you ate my heart out\n\n\n\nOne after another, they've always come and gone\n\nSo what if I'm a monster that's been here all along\n\nThey're dropping like flies whenever I'm around\n\nSo used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound\n\nMaybe I'm the monster that's been here all along",
