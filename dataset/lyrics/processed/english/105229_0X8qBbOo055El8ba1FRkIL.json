  "lyrics": "Hush, hush, ashes and dust\r\nTrouble's not worth the pleasure but I feel alive\r\nLust, lust, never enough\r\nIndelible human nature keeps me up at night\r\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nBut it's a wicked temptation\n\nIt's a wicked temptation\n\n\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces\n\nI know his hands will dig up my secrets\n\nIt's in your eyes, ah, you fucking liar\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces\n\n\n\nBang, bang, fire away\n\nThe rapture's trying to kill me\n\nPulsing through my heart\n\nAnd pain, pain, always the same\n\nBeautiful hurts like crazy when it falls apart\n\n\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nBut it's a wicked temptation\n\nIt's a wicked temptation\n\n\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces\n\nI know his hands will dig up my secrets\n\nIt's in your eyes, ah, you fucking liar\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces\n\n\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nBut it's a wicked temptation\n\nIt's a wicked temptation\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nIt's a pretty fixation\n\nBut it's a wicked temptation\n\nIt's a wicked temptation\n\n\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces\n\nI know his hands will dig up my secrets\n\nIt's in your eyes, ah, you fucking liar\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces\n\nI know this love will tear me to pieces",
