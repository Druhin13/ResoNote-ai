  "lyrics": "Do you see the way that we have grown apart\r\nI don’t like it at all\r\nDo you see the ways that we have gone too far\r\nDrifting off of our course\r\nDo you see the ways that we’ve let plastic cover the ocean like snow\r\nSnow it always melts\n\nWith the seasons change and the summers help\n\nOne’s cold water and one was oil before\n\nOh, how much there's left to learn\n\n\n\nLately I’ve been worried\n\nI don’t know where to it is that I do belong\n\nLately I’ve been too busy\n\nTo smell the bottle brush\n\nJust chasing laps around the sun\n\nI’ve sat here and cried, salt running from my eyes\n\nWondering how the fuck will I end up with you\n\nYou just laugh and smile\n\nShake your head and remind me that\n\nAll good things can come true\n\nOh, how much there is left to learn\n\n\n\nDo you see the way that we have gone too far\n\nWe need now more than ever before\n\nTo come together put our differences apart\n\nStop drifting off of our course\n\nDo you see the way that we need our reefs just like trees along the shore\n\nIf it knows to help\n\nHalf of what we breathe in for ourselves\n\nIs out of sight and on the ocean floor\n\nOh, how much there is left to learn\n\n\n\nLately I’ve been worried\n\nI don’t know where to it is that I do belong\n\nLately I’ve been too busy\n\nTo smell the bottle brush\n\nJust chasing laps around the sun\n\nI’ve sat here and cried, salt running from my eyes\n\nWondering how the fuck will I end up with you\n\nAnd you just laugh and smile\n\nShake your head and remind me that\n\nAll good things can come true\n\nOh, how much there is left to learn\n\nOoh ohh, how much there is left to learn\n\nOoh ohh, how much there is left to learn",
