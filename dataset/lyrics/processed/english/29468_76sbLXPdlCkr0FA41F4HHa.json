  "lyrics": "Stygian minions of esteemed erudition\r\nBear witness to the most abject human condition\r\nStaunch technicians of decomposition\r\nBreathing life into the lifeless animating his vision\r\nAll partake in occult calibration\r\nRealigning the ley-slime for the dark invocation\n\nSing on high to the lords long unspoken\n\nReborn into the world through the minds of his chosen\n\n\n\nPsychic virus from the vast outer reaches\n\nMarks the grand unification of science and religion\n\nIn the name of our brethren; the Molluscs\n\nLesser lifeforms prostrate before the horror of horrors\n\nTerrible vistas of a nihilistic future\n\nThe old cthonic scriptures; the new jurisprudence\n\nTo usher an era of grand cosmic culture\n\nAll nations and worlds under the sign of Mollusca\n\n\n\nSubmit your soul, for it's no use to you where you go\n\nBeyond the passage of time\n\nEmbrace the void in which all things were made and destroyed\n\nWe shall be one in his mind\n\n\n\nPraise be the name of the dark incarnate\n\nGreat beast of the all-in-one\n\nFirst of the gods from the formless chaos\n\nKindling the flame of the suns\n\n\n\nHis children most resplendent and pure\n\nShall inherit the order of worlds\n\nFrom the lowest dominion unto the mucus throne\n\nThat this Kingdom might ever endure\n\n\n\nCast off the flesh become one with the ooze\n\nAnd through the god-mind what's broken is renewed",
