  "lyrics": "Life without you is like a car with no gas, going fast\r\nTryna make it to my ex and I just want this thing to last\r\nI don't wanna crash (Or break down)\r\nIt's true that I thought the life without you was like the number two\r\nWhen they find out they could take away the one, just for math\r\nI think I'm gonna skip that class\n\nI don't wanna miss my other half\n\nOoh\n\nOoh\n\nOoh\n\n\n\nLove you, love you, love you like I do\n\nAlways wanna fuck you like I do\n\nTell me who thinks of you like I do\n\nThat's why you can't tell me what I would do\n\nWithout you, I can't be without you\n\nI can't be without, my other, half\n\nIt's just simple math\n\nIt's just simple math",
