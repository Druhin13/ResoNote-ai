  "lyrics": "I'm finding myself at a loss for words \nAnd the funny thing is it's okay \nThe last thing I need is to be heard \nBut to hear what You would say \n[Chorus]\n\nWord of God speak \n\nWould You pour down like rain \n\nWashing my eyes to see \n\nYour majesty \n\nTo be still and know \n\nThat You're in this place \n\nPlease let me stay and rest \n\nIn Your holiness \n\nWord of God speak \n\n\n\nI'm finding myself in the midst of You \n\nBeyond the music, beyond the noise \n\nAll that I need is to be with You \n\nAnd in the quiet hear Your voice \n\n\n\n[Chorus 2x]\n\n\n\nI'm finding myself at a loss for words \n\nAnd the funny thing is it's okay",
