  "lyrics": "Away in a manger no crib for a bed\r\nThe little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head\r\nThe stars in the bright sky looked down where he lay\r\nThe little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay\r\nThe cattle are lowing the baby awakes\n\nBut little Lord Jesus no crying he makes\n\nI love You Lord Jesus look down from the sky\n\nAnd stay by my cradle till morning is nigh\n\n\n\nBe near me Lord Jesus I ask You to stay\n\nClose by me forever, and love me, I pray\n\nBless all the dear children in Thy tender care\n\nAnd fit us for heaven, to live with Thee there\n\n\n\nThe little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay",
