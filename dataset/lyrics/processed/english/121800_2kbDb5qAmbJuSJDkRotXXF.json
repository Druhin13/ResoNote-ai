  "lyrics": "Under your scope\r\nSo you can see close\r\nAnalyze the way that my colors take fold\r\nYou pin my wings down\r\nSo you can find out\r\nHow long it'll take til I fall to the open ground\n\n\n\nI drag around all the weight of your words\n\nShutting me down so your voice can be heard\n\nMake me your clone\n\nMake me your own\n\n\n\nYou think you're curing a disease\n\nYou got the answers, the vaccines\n\nYou're making me hate me\n\nMaking me hate me\n\nPull at the strings to play your scene\n\nBut I cut the ties from underneath\n\nYou'll never save me\n\nYou'll never save me\n\n\n\nCause I wanna know\n\nAnd do you reap what you sew\n\nAnd do you dull whatever seems to have a pulse\n\nYou try and fix me\n\nTo fit your machine\n\nBut what's alive can never live without a soul\n\n\n\nI drag around all the weight of your words\n\nShutting me down so your voice can be heard\n\nMake me your clone\n\nMake me your own\n\n\n\nYou think you're curing a disease\n\nYou got the answers, the vaccines\n\nYou're making me hate me\n\nMaking me hate me\n\nPull at the strings to play your scene\n\nBut I cut the ties from underneath\n\nYou'll never save me\n\nYou'll never save me\n\n\n\nTry to be the one that you want and it just wasn't enough\n\nYou took all my pride and turned it to dust\n\nYou take my fragile bones and you make them your own\n\nYou wanted everything til nothing's left of me\n\n\n\nYou think you're curing a disease\n\nYou got the answers, the vaccines\n\nYou're making me hate me\n\nMaking me hate me\n\nPull at the strings to play your scene\n\nBut I cut the ties from underneath\n\nYou'll never save me\n\nYou'll never save me\n\n\n\nCause I wanna know",
