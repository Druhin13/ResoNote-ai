  "lyrics": "Sunday nights that you want her\r\nLike velvet cake\r\nSweetheart can bargain\r\nHalf-price mistakes\r\nShe will go down with her ship\n\nLike a good captain\n\nYou're sitting on the dock\n\nPlaying for an audience of one\n\n\n\nPacing your apartment\n\nLinoleum floors\n\nGet a call from an old friend\n\nShe never liked them before\n\n\n\nHe will drive all over three lanes\n\nYou sit tight, shotgun\n\nWindshield wipers\n\nWaving for an audience of one\n\n\n\nYou came out from the country\n\nWearing mamma's clothes\n\nYou were born in the city\n\nDaddy's dominos\n\n\n\nYou need a record you can move to\n\nWell we got one\n\nDrop the needle\n\nWe are playing for an audience of one\n\n\n\nDrop the needle\n\nWe are playing for an audience of one\n\n\n\nOne gets all of you\n\nTwo's jealous\n\nThree gets even less\n\nFour divides you up then you're left\n\nPleasing all your guests\n\n\n\nReach out your pointer finger\n\nAnd touch the globe\n\nSpin it round and where it stops\n\nYou've got to pack your bags and go\n\n\n\nLand in the Mojave Desert\n\nSing for the sun\n\n\n\nThree's too many when you're playing for an audience of one\n\nTwo's too busy when you're playing for an audience of one\n\nOne is the only way you're playing for an audience of one",
