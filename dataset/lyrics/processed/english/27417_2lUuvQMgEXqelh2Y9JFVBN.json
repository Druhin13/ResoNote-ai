  "lyrics": "Strangers in the night, \nExchanging glances\nWandering the night, \nWhat were the chances\nWe'd be sharing love\nBefore the night was through\n\n\n\nSomething in your eyes\n\nWas so inviting\n\nSomething in your smile\n\nWas so exciting\n\nSomething in my heart\n\nTold me I must have you\n\n\n\nStrangers in the night\n\nTwo lonely people\n\nWe were strangers in the night\n\nUp to the moment \n\nWhen we said our first hello\n\nLittle did we know\n\nLove was just a glance away\n\nA warm embracing dance away\n\n\n\nAnd ever since that night \n\nWe've been together\n\nLovers at first sight\n\nIn love forever\n\nIt turned out so right\n\n\n\nStrangers in the night\n\nTwo lonely people\n\nWe were strangers in the night\n\nUp to the moment \n\nWhen we said our first hello\n\nLittle did we know\n\nLove was just a glance away\n\nA warm embracing dance away\n\nFor strangers in the night.",
