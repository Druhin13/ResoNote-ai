  "lyrics": "Well, here we are, adrift again\r\nI can taste the spit in the oxygen\r\nThe pilot's song forgotten at the yard\r\nTo feel the awful trembling hands of God\r\nAnd I hope that this plane goes down\n\nSo I can see who comes to mind\n\nSo I can see who comes to mind\n\n\n\nYeah, I can crack a smile\n\nAnd I'm all right, I'm just so tired of feeling tired\n\nThe conscious floating in and out of our cartoon\n\nSedated in a cheery underworld\n\nThoughts of leaking out\n\nA dry and gaping mouth\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that this plane goes down\n\nSo I can see who comes to mind\n\nSo I can see who comes to mind\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that this plane goes down\n\nSo I can see you one last time\n\nSo I can see you one last time\n\n\n\nAnd dream away\n\nAnd dream away\n\nAnd dream away\n\nAnd dream away",
