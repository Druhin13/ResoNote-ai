  "lyrics": "Leap y'all feelings in a single bound\r\nWhen this thing go down\r\nYou know the boy rap rings around\r\nAnybody copying the sound it's\r\nTigallo to the rescue\r\nComing right back to these streets\n\nLike a biscuit and tea wit the 3-piece\n\nBut I'm here to ignore the hype all ya likes and retweets\n\nFuck readin ya thinkpiece, nigga\n\nTigallo to the rescue\n\nAt a minimum we gonna handle 'em\n\nTell ya whole crew they better ante up\n\nCause he don't pause\n\nNo flaws, these bars is adamantium\n\nWe got a plan of attack\n\nUnderstand this ain't what you want\n\nUnderstand I am much too raw\n\nMore realer compared to what you saw\n\nDown to earth but up to par\n\nSo try again better luck tomorrow\n\nIt was an order that was much too tall\n\nAnd when the darkness rises\n\nAin't no surprises\n\nY'all know who the fuck to call\n\nTigallo to the rescue\n\n\n\nI've been waiting for this moment all my life\n\nNever knowing what to say\n\nBut if truth is love and all the ways it shines\n\nMay it brighten all your days",
