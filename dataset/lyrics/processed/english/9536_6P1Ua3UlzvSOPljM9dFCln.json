  "lyrics": "I remember looking around a hospital waiting room\r\nFull of people all absorbed in their own personal catastrophes\r\nAll reading books like \"Being Mortal,\" all with a look in their eyes\r\nAnd I remember feeling like, \"No, no one can understand,\"\r\n\"No, my devastation is unique.\"\n\nBut people get cancer and die\n\nPeople get hit by trucks and die\n\nPeople just living their lives\n\nGet erased for no reason with the rest of us watching from the side\n\n\n\nAnd some people have to survive\n\nAnd find a way to feel lucky to still be alive\n\nTo sleep through the night\n\n\n\nI wrote down all the details of how my house fell apart\n\nHow the person I loved got killed by a bad disease\n\nOut of nowhere for no reason and me living in the blast zone\n\nWith our daughter and etcetera and [?] these songs\n\nAnd the next thing I knew I was standing in the dirt\n\nUnder the desert sky at night outside Phoenix\n\nAt a music festival that had paid to fly me in\n\nTo play death songs to a bunch of young people on drugs\n\nStanding in the dust next to an idling bus\n\nWith Skrillex inside and the sound of subwoofers in the distance\n\nI had stayed up til three talking to Weyes Blood and Father John Misty\n\nAbout songwriting in the backstage bungalows\n\nEating fruit and jumping on the bed like lost children\n\nExploding across the earth in a self-indulgent all-consuming\n\nWreck of ideas that blot out the stars\n\nTo be still alive felt so absurd\n\n\n\nPeople get cancer and die\n\nPeople get hit by trucks and die\n\nPeople just living their lives get erased for no reason\n\nWith the rest of us averting our eyes\n\n\n\nWhen I was leaning on Skrillex's tour bus waiting for the hotel shuttle in the middle of the night\n\nI barely knew who I was\n\nI looked up and saw Orion wielding a club and a shield\n\nAnd there you were again:\n\nMajestic dead wife\n\nAs my grief becomes calcified, frozen in stories\n\nAnd in these songs I keep singing, numbing it down\n\nThe unsingable real memories of you\n\nAnd the feral eruptions of sobbing\n\n\n\nThese waves hit less frequently\n\nThey thin and then they are gone\n\nYou are gone and then your echo is gone\n\nAnd the crying is gone\n\nAnd what is left of this merchandise?\n\n\n\nThis is what my life feels like now\n\nLike I got abruptly dropped off by the side of the road\n\nIn the middle of a long horrible ride\n\nIn a hot van that was too full of confident chattering dudes\n\nAnd the sound of tires receding\n\nTaking in the night air I say\n\n\"Now only.\"",
