  "lyrics": "There's never enough time in the day\r\nAnd those hands on the clock don't take a break\r\nSeems like I don't either these days\r\nAnd that freeway, speedway, highspeed chase\r\nMakes it hard to hit the brakes\r\nBut she knows how to make my heart race\n\n\n\nJust a little slower\n\nTake my time and when I get to hold her\n\nHeaven feels a little closer\n\nWith her head right on my shoulder\n\nNext to her the fire burns\n\nAnd the world turns\n\nJust a little slower\n\n\n\nThe more I know the more I like\n\nShe gets finer like a bottle of wine\n\nFeels so good and gets better with time\n\nOh, the highest highs ain't never end\n\nDon't know how she does it\n\nBut it's magic when she makes the sunset\n\n\n\nJust a little slower\n\nTake my time and when I get to hold her\n\nHeaven feels a little closer\n\nWith her head right on my shoulder\n\nNext to her the fire burns\n\nAnd the world turns\n\nJust a little slower\n\n\n\nI know one day I'll look back on my life\n\nAnd look into her eyes\n\nWatch it all flash by\n\nAnd wish that we could do it one more time\n\nJust a little slower\n\n\n\nOh, just a little slower\n\nTake my time and when I get to hold her\n\nHeaven feels a little closer\n\nWith her head right on my shoulder\n\nOh, next to her the fire burns\n\nAnd the world turns\n\nJust a little slower\n\nJust a little slower",
