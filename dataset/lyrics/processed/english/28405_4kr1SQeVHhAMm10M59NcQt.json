  "lyrics": "The legend tells of Icarus\r\nWho flew too close towards the sun\r\nDaVinci drew the plans for flight\r\nBut never saw his work begun\r\nYou'll find the answers\r\nThe answers riding on the wind\n\n\n\nMan has always looked towards the sky\n\nAnd dreamed of one day learning how to fly\n\nTo soar just like an eagle out of sight\n\nThey're searching for the secret\n\nThe secret of flight\n\n\n\nOn the fields the brothers Wright\n\nWait to launch their maiden flight\n\nShape the wings, the air will split\n\nThe different pressure gives the lift\n\nYou seek the knowledge\n\nThe knowledge hidden in the clouds\n\n\n\nMan has always looked towards the sky\n\nAnd dreamed of one day learning how to fly\n\nTo soar just like an eagle out of sight\n\nThey're searching for the secret\n\nThe secret of flight\n\nThe secret of flight\n\n\n\nThrough the wars, the race went on\n\nTo build the planes to drop the bomb\n\nThe jet age came at the speed of sound\n\nEinstein's theory breaking the ground\n\nLook for the truth\n\nThe truth of how the birds can fly\n\n\n\nMan has always looked towards the sky\n\nAnd dreamed of one day learning how to fly\n\nTo soar just like an eagle out of sight\n\nThey're searching for the secret\n\nThe secret of flight\n\nMan has always looked towards the sky (The secret of flight)\n\nAnd dreamed of one day learning how to fly (The secret of flight)\n\nTo soar just like an eagle out of sight (The secret of flight)\n\nThey're searching for the secret\n\nThe secret of flight\n\nThe secret of flight\n\nThe secret of flight\n\nThe secret of flight",
