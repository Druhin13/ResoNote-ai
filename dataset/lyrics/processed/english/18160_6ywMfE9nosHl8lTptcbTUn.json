  "lyrics": "You're heading out, as I'm coming home\r\nBut I haven't seen you in forever\r\nWe steal a kiss, and you close the door\r\nI guess we're alone in this together\r\n'Cause life keeps getting between us\n\nAnd it's all too heavy to keep up anymore\n\n\n\nWe stuck by it, we kept trying\n\nBut there's no fighting bad timing\n\nI wish we'd met each other five years later\n\n'Cause I hate the way we're being torn apart\n\nWe stuck by it, we kept trying\n\nBut there's no fighting bad timing, bad timing\n\n\n\nWell I miss the nights, we'd lie awake\n\nBoth throwing shadows at the ceiling\n\nWe needed days, me and you\n\nTo try to recreate the feeling\n\n\n\nBut life keeps getting between us\n\nAnd it's all too heavy to keep up anymore\n\n\n\nWe stuck by it, we kept trying\n\nBut there's no fighting bad timing\n\nI wish we'd met each other five years later\n\n'Cause I hate the way we're being torn apart\n\nWe stuck by it, we kept trying\n\nBut there's no fighting bad timing, bad timing\n\n\n\nOh woah\n\nOh woah\n\nOh woah oh\n\nOh woah\n\nOh woah\n\nOh woah oh\n\n\n\nI wish we'd met each other five years later\n\n'Cause I hate the way we're being torn apart\n\nWe stuck by it, kept trying\n\nBut there's no fighting bad timing\n\nIt's just bad timing, bad timing\n\nBad timing, it's just bad timing",
