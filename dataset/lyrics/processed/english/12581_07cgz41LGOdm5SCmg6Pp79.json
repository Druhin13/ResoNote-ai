  "lyrics": "He's been sweating cold again and\r\nI don't think I can do much\r\nSuddenly his memories get diluted in his sleep\r\nI know his heart ached, I know his past\r\nBut when silk gets rougher\r\nYou keep walking around\n\nYou keep walking around, my baby\n\n\n\nAll frustrations began when\n\nYou saw my joy as a crime\n\nI need somehow to save you\n\nFrom the nightmares in the night\n\nI need somehow to bring you out\n\nTo the morning light, to the morning light\n\nTo the morning light, to the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\n\n\nYou shouldn't make me rush (You shouldn't make me rush)\n\n'Cause then it won't last (You know it won't last)\n\n'Cause when you hold me tight (If you hold me tight, my babe)\n\nIt doesn't mean we're fine (Doesn't mean we're fine)\n\n\n\nLooking back to when we met, I never thought\n\nIt would be this hard, cuddles and eternal sex\n\nBlowing bubbles into space\n\nI saw your heartache, but I'm not your past\n\nWhen your skin starts to ruckle\n\nYou keep walking around\n\nYou keep walking around, my baby\n\n\n\nAll frustrations began when\n\nYou saw my joy as a crime\n\nAnd I need some way to save you\n\nFrom the nightmares in the night\n\nAnd I need somehow to bring you out\n\nTo the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\nTo the morning light\n\n\n\nTo the morning light",
