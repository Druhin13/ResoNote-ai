  "lyrics": "Feel that salt in the air, almost there\r\nGot that wind in my hair, Ray-Ban glare\r\nHear that song we love on the radio\r\nStir it up baby, we both know\r\nWe’re ‘bout to float that Malibu\n\nWith that flip-flop attitude\n\nWith that old school mixtape playing\n\n\n\nOver and over again on a blown out speaker\n\nDance in the sand while the sun sets deeper\n\nGot that top back on that Jeep\n\nGot that soundtrack on repeat\n\nGot that one hand on my knee and I want it\n\nOver and over again, catching summer fever\n\nSummer fever, summer fever\n\n\n\nClose our eyes and let it take us\n\nLost in the waves and the palm trees swaying\n\nAll alone and out of reach\n\nJust the stars and the moonlight, you and me\n\n\n\nWe’re ‘bout to float that Malibu\n\nWith that barefoot attitude\n\nWith that slow jam mixtape playing\n\n\n\nOver and over again on a blown out speaker\n\nDance in the sand while the sun sets deeper\n\nGot that top back on that Jeep\n\nGot that soundtrack on repeat\n\nGot that one hand on my knee and I want it\n\nOver and over again, catching summer fever\n\nSummer fever, summer fever\n\n\n\nEndless sun kissed smile on our face\n\nChase that love like it’s running away\n\nAnd I want it\n\nYeah I want it\n\nOhh\n\n\n\nOver and over again on a blown out speaker\n\nDance in the sand while the sun sets deeper\n\nGot that top back on that Jeep\n\nGot that soundtrack on repeat\n\nGot that one hand on my knee and I want it\n\nOver and over again catching summer fever, summer fever, summer fever\n\n\n\nOver and over again, catching summer fever\n\nSummer fever, summer fever",
