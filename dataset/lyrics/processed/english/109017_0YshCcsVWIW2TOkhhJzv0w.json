  "lyrics": "Well an airplane's faster than a Cadillac\r\nAnd a whole lot smoother than a camel's back\r\nBut I don't care how you get to me\r\nJust get to me\r\nParasail or first class mail\r\nGet on the back of a Nightingale\n\nJust get to me I don't care just get to me\n\nProkeds, mopeds take a limousine instead\n\nThey ain't cheap but they're easy to find\n\nGet on the highway point yourself my way\n\nTake a roller coaster that comes in sideways\n\nJust get to me - yeah \n\n\n\nGo on hitch a ride on the back\n\nof a butterfly\n\nThere's no better way to fly\n\nTo get to me\n\nI look around at what I got\n\nAnd without you, it ain't a lot\n\nBut I got every, with you, everything \n\n\n\nMaybe you could pollinate over the\n\nGolden Gate\n\nTake a left hand turn at the corner\n\nOf Haight\n\nAnd then a sharp right\n\nAt the first street light\n\nAnd get yourself on a motor bike\n\nAnd if you think you'll get stuck in a\n\ntraffic jam\n\nThat's fine, send yourself through a telephone line\n\nIt doesn't matter how you get to me\n\nJust get to me \n\n\n\nCause after every day\n\nThe wind blows the night time my way\n\nAnd I imagine that you are\n\nAbove me like a star\n\nAnd you keep on glowing\n\nAnd you keep on showing me the way\n\nSHINE SHINE SHINE",
