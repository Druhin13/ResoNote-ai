  "lyrics": "If you wake up and don't want to smile,\r\nIf it takes just a little while,\r\nOpen your eyes and look at the day,\r\nYou'll see things in a different way.\r\nDon't stop, thinking about tomorrow,\r\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here,\n\nIt'll be, better than before,\n\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.\n\nWhy not think about times to come,\n\nAnd not about the things that you've done,\n\nIf your life was bad to you,\n\nJust think what tomorrow will do.\n\nDon't stop, thinking about tomorrow,\n\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here,\n\nIt'll be, better than before,\n\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.\n\nAll I want is to see you smile,\n\nIf it takes just a little while,\n\nI know you don't believe that it's true,\n\nI never meant any harm to you.\n\nDon't stop, thinking about tomorrow,\n\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here,\n\nIt'll be, better than before,\n\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.\n\nDon't stop, thinking about tomorrow,\n\nDon't stop, it'll soon be here,\n\nIt'll be, better than before,\n\nYesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.\n\nDon't you look back,\n\nDon't you look back,\n\nDon't you look back...",
