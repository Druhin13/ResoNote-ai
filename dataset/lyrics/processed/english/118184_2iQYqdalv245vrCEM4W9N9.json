  "lyrics": "When I first saw you, the end was soon\r\nTo Bethlehem, it slouched and then\r\nMust've caught a good look at you\r\nGive your heart and soul to charity\r\n'Cause the rest of you, the best of you\r\nHoney, belongs to me\n\n\n\nAin't it a gentle sound, the rollin' in the graves?\n\nAin't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?\n\nAin't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?\n\n\n\nAin't you my baby?\n\nAin't you my baby?\n\n\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing can get a look in on my baby\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing, nothing, nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nIf I was born as a blackthorn tree\n\nI'd wanna be felled by you, held by you\n\nFuel the pyre of your enemies\n\nAin't it warming you, the world goin' up in flames?\n\nAin't it the life where you you're lighting up the blaze?\n\nAin't it a waste it watch the throwing of the shade?\n\n\n\nAin't you my baby?\n\nAin't you my baby?\n\n\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing can get a look in on my baby\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing, nothing, nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing can get a look in on my baby\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing, nothing, nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing can get a look in on my baby\n\nNothing fucks with my baby\n\nNothing, nothing, nothing, nothing",
