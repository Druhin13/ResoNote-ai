  "lyrics": "Hey\r\nThis girl moved into my apartment (one day)\r\nOne look at her my heart was stopping (heartbreak)\r\nI did whatever she was asking\r\nShe said \"maybe later catch you in the elevator\"\n\nA couple days we got to hanging (real close)\n\nTurns out she wasn't even taken (no no)\n\nI made a move she said \"baby you're mistaken, I'm not into bacon\"\n\n\n\nShe got that smile and that body is to die for\n\nOne of a kind and that's why it makes me cry\n\n\n\nCause I found a girl\n\nWho's in love with a girl\n\nShe said that she tried\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nOh, why? Tell me why\n\nDid I fall for those eyes?\n\nShe said I was nice\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nI found a girl\n\n\n\nI should've known to walk away then\n\nI should've left that alone\n\nBut why'd you call me on the phone we'll be hanging again\n\nUnder the premise of friends\n\nBut now she only talks to me about some other woman she says\n\n\n\nShe got that smile and that body is to die for\n\nOne of a kind and that's why it makes me cry\n\n\n\nCause I found a girl\n\nWho's in love with a girl\n\nShe said, that she tried\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nOh, why? Tell me why\n\nDid I fall for those eyes?\n\nShe said I was nice\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nI found a girl\n\nOh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh (I found a girl)\n\nOh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh\n\n\n\nI can't believe I met somebody like you\n\nAnd now I feel like I'm fooled\n\nAnd that to me is so cruel\n\nI can't believe it I just think like a man\n\nThat you just wanted me bad\n\nBut you had different plans\n\n\n\nCause I found a girl\n\nWho's in love with a girl\n\nShe said, that she tried\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nOh, why? Tell me why\n\nDid I fall for those eyes?\n\nShe said I was nice\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nI found a girl\n\n\n\nI found a girl\n\nWho's in love with a girl\n\nShe said, that she tried\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nOh, why? Tell me why\n\nDid I fall for those eyes?\n\nShe said I was nice\n\nBut she's not into guys\n\nI found a girl",
