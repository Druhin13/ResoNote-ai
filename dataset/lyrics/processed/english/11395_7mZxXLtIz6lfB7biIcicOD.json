  "lyrics": "Faced with such stern symmetry\r\nWeathered skin turned burgundy\r\nThe most handsome man you ever saw\r\nThat smirk like sour razor jaw\r\nHold your rose and\n\nSee the fingers are starting to bend\n\n\n\nWe can move\n\nWe can't miss out, no\n\nBefore we're gone\n\nYou've meant the most\n\nI said it all now\n\n\n\nFaced with such soft tendency\n\nSaved a man withdrawn like me\n\nLove you more and I'm on my way home\n\nForgot everything I'll ever know\n\n\n\nHold your rose in\n\nBitter red buried it like a fact\n\n\n\nWe can move\n\nWe can't miss out, no\n\nBefore we're gone\n\nYou've meant the most\n\nI said it all now\n\n\n\nAs pure as they come\n\nAnd I was after the same light you drew\n\nIt's been too much\n\nAnd I could never say aloud\n\n\"That's enough\"\n\n\n\nMercy now, mercy now, blood",
