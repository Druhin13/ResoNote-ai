  "lyrics": "Hey ho, where did you go?\r\nDid you wriggle or roll? Did you giggle or grumble through?\r\nTom Thumb, from where did you come?\r\nDid you toddle or run? Did you skip, trip, or stumble through?\r\nGo down, let’s go down\n\nLet's go down; don’t you want to go down\n\nAnd wriggle on, have a sing along\n\nPut some pickles on, and play the Mellotron?\n\n\n\nGo down, let’s go down\n\nLet's go down; don’t you want to come down\n\nAnd wriggle on, count to twenty-one\n\nAnd go and right a wrong, and feed the pelicans?\n\n\n\nSay there, the jug or the hare?\n\nThe lift or the stairs? Which will it be for you?\n\nHow now, big brown cow?\n\nThe bow or the bough? The spade or the plough for you?\n\n\n\nGo down, let’s go down\n\nLet's go down; don’t you want to go down\n\nAnd wriggle on, have a sing along\n\nPut some pickles on, and play the Mellotron?\n\n\n\nGo down, let’s go down\n\nLet's go down; don’t you want to come down\n\nAnd wriggle on, count to twenty-one\n\nAnd go and right a wrong, and feed the pelicans?\n\n\n\nBut where will we go\n\nWhen the bell, it tolls for me?\n\nBoth you and I know\n\nWhen it tolls, well, it tolls for thee?\n\n\n\nBut where will we go\n\nWhen the bell, it tolls for me?\n\nBoth you and I know\n\nWhen it tolls, well, it tolls for thee?\n\n\n\nGo down, let’s go down\n\nLet's go down; don’t you want to go down\n\nAnd wriggle on, have a sing along\n\nPut some pickles on, and play the Mellotron?\n\n\n\nGo down, let’s go down\n\nLet's go down; don’t you want to come down\n\nAnd wriggle on, count to twenty-one\n\nAnd go and right a wrong, and feed the pelicans?",
