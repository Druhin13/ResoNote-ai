  "lyrics": "I really need to get out of my head\r\nBut I just keep replaying what she said\r\nI don't like the pressure, I'm just gonna stay in bed\r\nThe wheels gotta turn, that's what they say\r\nI'm laying here alone and that's okay\r\nI'm just below the moonlight, floating over Monterrey\n\n\n\nSometimes I get so lazy\n\nSometimes I go so slow\n\nSometimes I act so crazy\n\nSometimes I feel so low\n\nSometimes I get so lazy\n\nSometimes I go so slow\n\nSometimes I act so crazy\n\nSometimes I feel so low\n\n\n\nI'm feeling so lento, lento, lento\n\nI'm feeling so lento, lento, lento\n\n\n\nThey say you're number one, gotta run, gotta run\n\nBut I'm just havin' fun, havin' fun, havin' fun\n\nYou tell a better story\n\nWhen time's movin' slowly\n\nIf there's something I'll never do\n\nThen it's rushing to be with you\n\nDon't think it's a crime, I'm taking my time\n\nAnd there's nothing to do\n\n'Cause\n\n\n\nSometimes I get so lazy\n\nSometimes I go so slow\n\nSometimes I act so crazy\n\nSometimes I feel so low\n\nSometimes I get so lazy\n\nSometimes I go so slow\n\nSometimes I act so crazy\n\nSometimes I feel so low\n\n\n\nI'm feeling so lento, lento, lento\n\nI'm feeling so lento, lento, lento\n\nI’m feeling so lento lento lento\n\nI’m feeling so lento lento lento\n\n\n\nI’m feeling so lento lento lento\n\nI’m feeling so lento lento lento",
