  "lyrics": "You can't be forced to live a lie\r\nIf it lives inside you\r\nIt will come alive\r\nLet go of the fear you hold inside\r\nYour time is now\r\nWhen the smoke clears will the regret take hold?\n\nYou could have been so much more\n\nA taste of the poison you swallow\n\nLeft you broken, hopeless and hollow\n\nFight the fear of the unknown\n\nRip it up and start again\n\nDon't let your dreams descend\n\nBy the burden of how they end\n\nConflicted, shattered by the lack of self-respect\n\nYour time is now\n\nYou can't be forced to live a lie\n\nIf it lives inside you, it will come alive\n\nYou can't be forced to live a lie\n\nA life you will live to despise\n\nI won't look back in the face of defeat\n\nRaise your fists and rise up to your feet\n\nDo you have something to prove?\n\nWhat have we really got to lose?\n\nFight the fear of the unknown\n\nRip it up and start again\n\nDon't let your dreams descend\n\nBy the burden of how they end\n\nYou can't be forced to live a lie\n\nIf it lives inside you, it will come alive\n\nYou can't be forced to live a lie\n\nA life you will live to despise\n\nThere will be no light to guide the way\n\nTake control of what you make your own\n\nDon't live a lie\n\nSuffering is bound to overcome when we fall\n\nYou have to learn from it\n\nYou have to take control\n\nDon't live a lie\n\nDon't live a lie",
