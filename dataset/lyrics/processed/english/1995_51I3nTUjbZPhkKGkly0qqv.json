  "lyrics": "It hurts because I love you too much\r\nSad day, I never get what I want\r\nI get the smile with the lies, yeah\r\nI guess that's no surprise, yeah\r\nLately I've been filling my drinks\n\nYou cheat, I cheat, same old thing\n\nVeil across my eyes, yeah\n\nSomething don't feel right\n\n\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nOoh, go our separate ways\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nOoh, go our separate ways\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate\n\n\n\nWatched\n\nMy Goddess turn to stone\n\nRight before my eyes\n\nRight before my eyes\n\n\n\nShe wore a cloak of armor\n\nNo man could penetrate\n\nNo man could penetrate\n\n\n\nStole her outta Heaven\n\nGave her Hollywood feelings with a California figure\n\nNow she's a sex crazed\n\nA.O.D. Stripper\n\nNothing to lose but the crib and the paper\n\nWe went too far we should showed her alchemist\n\nGave alkaline water with that Deepak Chopra\n\nWe went too far when she pull it, pull it back\n\nWe went too far when she pull her, pull her back, yeah\n\n\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nOoh, go our separate ways\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nOoh, go our separate ways\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate\n\nSeparate, separate",
