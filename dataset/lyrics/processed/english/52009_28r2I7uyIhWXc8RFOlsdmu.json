  "lyrics": "I met you in the third grade\r\nI didn't know that you liked lemonade\r\nI met you another year later\r\nYou wore a red sweater with an alligator\r\nWe chased the ice cream truck across the street\r\nAnd I thought you seemed kind of neat\n\nWe held hands as we walked to the swings in the park.\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou're my girl\n\nI'm your man\n\nI don't care if we live in a garbage can\n\nI'm your man\n\nYou're my gal\n\nI'm so glad that we are pals.\n\n\n\nYou're not fat\n\nYou don't smell bad\n\nYou're always smiling\n\nNever sad\n\nI bet you take a shower every day\n\nHey hey hey hey hey.\n\n\n\nBut then when I saw you\n\nPlaying soccer with your friends\n\nI knew that day\n\nOur love would never end.\n\nAnd this whole time\n\nIt blows my mind\n\nOh well whatever\n\nWe're so good together\n\nWhen you marry me\n\nYou'll be my wife.\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nI'm in love, its great\n\nSee you again - can't wait\n\nThere's so much to do\n\nYou're such a pretty girl\n\nWe'll travel 'round the world\n\nTo see this love through.\n\n\n\nAnd if you ever went away from me\n\nI would cry\n\nI would fall down on one knee\n\nAnd I would pray\n\nYes I would pray\n\nThat you would come back\n\nTo me someday....\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nOh well, whatever\n\nYou and me\n\nand that red sweater\n\nOh well, whatever\n\nYou and me\n\nAnd that red sweater\n\nAre go!",
