  "lyrics": "Lady Madonna, children at your feet. \nWonder how you manage to make ends meet. \nWho finds the money? When you pay the rent? \nDid you think that money was heaven sent? \nFriday night arrives without a suitcase. \n\nSunday morning creep in like a nun. \n\nMonday's child has learned to tie his bootlace. \n\nSee how they run. \n\n\n\nLady Madonna, baby at your breast. \n\nWonder how you manage to feed the rest. \n\n\n\nSee how they run. \n\nLady Madonna, lying on the bed, \n\nListen to the music playing in your head. \n\n\n\nTuesday afternoon is never ending. \n\nWednesday morning papers didn't come. \n\nThursday night you stockings needed mending. \n\nSee how they run. \n\n\n\nLady Madonna, children at your feet. \n\nWonder how you manage to make ends meet.",
