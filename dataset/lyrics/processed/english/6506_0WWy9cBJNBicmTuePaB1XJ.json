  "lyrics": "Sun baked bones stripped clean\r\nFangs sparkle and gleam\r\nClaws drip of freshly shed blood\r\nWhile the corpses\r\nOf our masses\r\nRot in the mud\n\nSun falls\n\nAs no moon rises\n\nThe darkest of nights\n\nAre full of surprises\n\nIn the distance a dog howls\n\nBeneath our feet\n\nLurks something foul\n\n\n\nOne by one\n\nBodies rise from the ground\n\nDeafened ears\n\nHear not a sound\n\nDead set free\n\nEvil reings supreme\n\nGather demon clans\n\nBy the light of the moon\n\n\n\nFeasting on your flesh\n\nThe living dead\n\nTime has no meaning\n\nIt's the day we dread\n\nGazing out eof eyes\n\nDecaying and old\n\nHumanity has fallen\n\nThe bell tolls",
