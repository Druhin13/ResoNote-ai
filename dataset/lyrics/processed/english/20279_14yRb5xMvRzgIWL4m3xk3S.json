  "lyrics": "The man who turns masses into addicts like opium\r\nThe fishbone braid-bearer taking all hope from him\r\nTrying to rise higher than deep friars and sodium\r\nI'm tired like weak thighs standing at this podium\r\nI'm winning on the road, took dice and I loaded 'em\r\nNow the self-loathing loner is overthrowin' 'em\n\nAbout to run 'em over like I poured soda to the brim\n\nGot a high motor, I know I'm the cremè de la cremè\n\n[?] now women want [?]\n\nWhen I be writing these rhymes. they be feeling it all within\n\nLike it's pain in an organ\n\nI'm growing like pain in an orphan\n\nLike the rangers got power when I'm morphing\n\nI leave 'em all morning, from night to the morning\n\nI be up like an awning while they're throwing shade, I be yawning\n\nSo keep talking, you're never gonna stop me\n\nLike I got [?] Bishop too damn cocky\n\nOf course they try to block me but it be like they're 5'3\"\n\nThey physically incapable to tame a kid in my league\n\nThey tryna sleep, I'm making noise\n\nIt's the beast of the east and the voice of the voiceless\n\nLearn to keep poise around all of the poison\n\nAnd now I'm making an imprint like embroidering\n\nThey wanna build and really be destroying\n\nI can't feel 'em so I been avoiding\n\nMy plan's sealed in, they ain't ever spoiling\n\nI been cooking up hot like the pot boiling\n\n\n\nMy mind heavy, your mind is confetti light\n\nYou very tight, and Bishy's spotting like it's cellulite\n\nCellulite on these CDs, EPs, and the mic\n\nTell 'em hype like a senator, quarterback from the spike\n\nI'm hella nice and it comes from me thinking like lonely nights\n\nMy only fight is with the mind and the silence is overhyped\n\nOnly like what my heart do, it's your temple\n\nThen my art too, that's why I move as sharp as a harpoon\n\nLike a dark moon, [?]\n\nBeen [?]\n\nIt's my shot, I'm feeling Reggie Miller\n\nIt's knock down for three, that's the game sealer\n\nGot the touch, you out of luck\n\nI'm seeing through your new concealer\n\nFeel I'm the iller but uneasy as I leave the villa\n\nUsually my confidence is obvious and I'm the killer\n\nA whole iller package [?]\n\nThey say that he average, I'm laughing, I'm not jacking it\n\nDoing magic, you moving savage, can't interact with Bish\n\n[?]\n\nThese cats wack and live and miss",
