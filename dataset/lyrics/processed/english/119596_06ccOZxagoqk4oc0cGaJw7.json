  "lyrics": "From the manner of\r\nCutting whisper\r\nRising vapors through\r\nClouds of gold\r\nGiving fire and\n\nChange the demons\n\nWith undercurrents\n\nFar too strong to haul\n\n\n\nThe sun burnt out today\n\nFools are dancin' in the rain\n\nStopped by the acid stain\n\nAnd on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain\n\n\n\nNightfall hunts us all\n\nFrom the shadows\n\nCynical beauty now\n\nLies the host\n\n\n\nBefore the flicker\n\nThere's only blackness\n\nThe end is coming\n\nAll my friends are dead\n\n\n\nThe sun burnt out today\n\nFools are dancin' in the rain\n\nStopped by the acid stain\n\nAnd on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain\n\n\n\nRid by an empty world\n\nSuffer the crushing weight\n\nMadness will crawl inside\n\nAlter the selfish stage\n\nFeeding on the voices in my head\n\n\n\n(Slowly we'll learn)\n\n(Slowly we'll learn)\n\n(Slowly we'll learn)\n\n(Slowly we'll learn)\n\n(Slowly we'll learn)\n\n\n\nThe unruled hedges we\n\nTurn to someone\n\nAll those weeping will\n\nGo unheard\n\n\n\nUp on that once green hill\n\nAround the mazes\n\nAnd seeing the darkness\n\nThe jaws will take it slowly\n\n\n\nThe sun burnt out today\n\nFools are dancin' in the rain\n\nStopped by the acid stain\n\nAnd on the shelf, the jar that holds my brain\n\n\n\nRid by an empty world\n\nSuffer the crushing weight\n\nMadness will crawl inside\n\nAlter the selfish stage\n\nYou're feeding all the voices in my head\n\nYou're feeding all the voices in my head\n\nThey're feeding all the voices in my head\n\nThey're feeding all the voices in my head",
