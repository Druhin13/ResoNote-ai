  "lyrics": "There's a Marlboro Man with horn-rimmed glasses\r\nHolding up the end of the bar\r\nYeah, he's rubbin' his neck, drink in his hand, ignoring the band\r\nI've seen him in this place before\r\nShe's a fake I.D. with dirty blonde hair\n\nSippin' on a Moscow Mule\n\nAah, shirt too low, skirt too high, catchin' the eye\n\nOf every Hefner in the room\n\n\n\nAnd maybe it's just me or is everybody in here\n\nJust as lonely?\n\nOr is it just another scene from a corner booth at closing time\n\nOn a Tuesday?\n\n\n\nThere's a cellphone man with his tie on the table\n\nNothin' in his glass but the rocks\n\nYeah he's watchin' the door, checkin' the time, checkin' the town\n\nYou can almost hear his heart .. tick-tock\n\n\n\nThen the door flies open and the breeze blows and then I can see her\n\nWedding ring, you know that it ain't his\n\nAnd her lipstick is guilty red, he pulls her close and they start to dance\n\nThey fit right in\n\n\n\nAnd maybe it's just me or is everybody in here\n\nJust as lonely?\n\nOr is it just another scene from a corner booth at closing time\n\nOn a Tuesday?\n\n\n\nMaybe it's just me or is everybody in here\n\nJust as lonely?\n\nOr is it just another scene from a corner booth at closing time\n\nOn a Tuesday?\n\n\n\nHeyyyyyyyy\n\n\n\nThen the Marlboro man with horn-rimmed glasses\n\nDisappears with the dirty blonde hair\n\nAnd the bartender stacks the chairs\n\nAnd we all goooooo home",
