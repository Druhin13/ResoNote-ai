  "lyrics": "All is calm and dormant\r\nA fragile balance in a vast space\r\nAn eternal deadlock\r\nAn eternal deadlock\r\nA subtle impulse moves the grid\n\nA million years of solitude\n\nAbout to merge into the cloud\n\nI begin to float\n\nLike a dance to a tender sound\n\nRelentless we get closer\n\nEmotions awake in unison\n\nI open my eyes for the first time\n\nYou are already there\n\nAll is melting into your core\n\nYou are exhaustible\n\nBut we want more\n\nYou are the extensive answer\n\nYou burst out into space\n\nTo be heard and felt\n\nFor the ones who listen\n\nTo be heard and felt\n\nFor the ones who listen\n\n\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\n\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\n\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\n\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens\n\nHear and feel\n\nBe the one who listens",
