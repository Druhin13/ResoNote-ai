  "lyrics": "Will I make the matinee?\r\nWith my newest life\r\nAnd be that bright time\r\nAdvertise what makes you crazy\r\nSo I can second guess my focus\r\nAre you gonna hire me?\n\n\n\nI let you in\n\nSomehow I sit down\n\nRevoke the time and space for you to just\n\nFeel it in your name\n\n\n\nNow I’m the ref and a phone call cutting out\n\nBack on the bench I fall into the month I think about\n\nHow I sold seven doves when I was lying on your back\n\nI’ll meet you in the morning\n\nFigure out what gets me past\n\nA second in the shade\n\nFucking up a useful place\n\nPurgatory please me\n\n\n\nI let it live like a payday of mine\n\nI can’t let it be\n\nI'm high scoring memory\n\nJust a look at quiet history",
