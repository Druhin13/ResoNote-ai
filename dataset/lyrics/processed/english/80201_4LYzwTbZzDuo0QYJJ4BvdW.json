  "lyrics": "Here I'm going\r\nWlakin' with my baby in my arms\r\n'Cuz I am in the wrong end of the eight ball black\r\nAnd the devil, see, he's right behind us\r\nAnd this worker said she's gonna take my little baby\r\nMy little angel back\n\nBut they won't getcha,\n\n'Cuz I'm right here witcha\n\nOn the night train\n\n\n\nSwing low, Saint Cadillac\n\nTearin' down the alley\n\nAnd I'm reachin' so high for ya\n\nDon't let 'em take me back\n\nBroken like valiums and chumps in the rain\n\nThat cry and quiver\n\nWhen a blue horizon is sleeping in the station\n\nWith a ticket for a train\n\nSurely mine will deliver me there\n\n\n\nHere she comes ...\n\nI'm safe here with you\n\nOn the night train\n\nOh mamma, mamma,\n\nConcrete is wheeling by\n\nDown at the end of a lullaby\n\nOn the night train",
