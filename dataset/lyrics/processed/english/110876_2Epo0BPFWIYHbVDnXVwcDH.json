  "lyrics": "Wondering, wondering\r\nWhat would happen if I just say something, something\r\nIt's better off than me just doing nothing, nothing\r\nFeels like you've been wanting more\r\nI don't really know what I'm waiting for\r\nYou've been stalling, stalling\n\nTaking all your time, but we ain't got it, got it\n\nI just hope you know I'm being honest, honest\n\nWhen I say I want some more\n\nI don't really know what you're waiting for\n\n\n\nLate at night, lose our way\n\nYou and I hit the lights\n\nMight be wrong, might be right\n\nWake up in the morning with our clothes on the floor\n\n\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?\n\n\n\nYeah, you've been stalling, stalling\n\nThinking there's no way I catch you falling, falling\n\nAt first I blew you off, but now I'm all in\n\nI walk in, your clothes on the floor\n\nI don't really know what I'm waiting for\n\nLet's get it, 5 AM, know it's been a minute\n\nThis hotel out of city limits\n\nYou're not into catching feelings\n\nYou do shit just to say you did it\n\nSay your ex was insecure\n\nYou ain't got time for it anymore, so\n\nI don't really know what you're waiting for\n\n\n\nLate at night, lose our way\n\nYou and I hit the lights\n\nMight be wrong, might be right\n\nWake up in the morning with our clothes on the floor\n\n\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?\n\n\n\nLate at night, lose our way\n\nYou and I hit the lights\n\nMight be wrong, might be right\n\nWake up in the morning with our clothes on the floor\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?\n\nI don't really know what we waited for?",
