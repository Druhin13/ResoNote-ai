  "lyrics": "Ev'rywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy \n'Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in thestreet, boy \nBut what can a poor boy do \nExcept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band \n'Cause in sleepy London town \nThere's just no place for a street fighting man \n\nNo \n\n\n\nHey! Think the time is right for a palace revolution \n\n'Cauce where I live the game to play is compromise solution \n\nWell, then what can a poor boy do \n\nExcept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band \n\n'Cause in sleepy London town \n\nThere's no place for a street fighting man \n\nNo \n\n\n\nHey! Said my name is called disturbance \n\nI'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all hisservants \n\nWell, what can a poor boy do \n\nExcept to sing for a rock 'n' roll band \n\n'Cause in sleepy London town \n\nThere's no place for a street fighting man \n\nNo",
