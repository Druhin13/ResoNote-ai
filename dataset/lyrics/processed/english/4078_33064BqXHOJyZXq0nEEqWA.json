  "lyrics": "While you aim to maintain the status quo \nEmbody the persona of the average joe \nMe and Herbal T and the Lack of Fro are less rational \nWe international \nTo reiterate in case you're a little late \nI incinerate fakes on my dinner plate \n\nWe hungry, but ya'll gon' starve the hardest \n\nCause we stay well fed eating starvin' artists \n\nI'm a veteran authority better than the majority \n\nOf all the mothafuckas that ever been in the door of the industry \n\nI'm what you pretend to be \n\nHalf of you mothafuckas sound like shit to me \n\nThat's why I have no sympathy \n\nThat's why I take a shit in your stocking, and burn down your Christmas tree \n\nPoof, you're done, ya'll history \n\nI'm the truth behind the unsolved mystery \n\nI'm the epitome of victory \n\nInstinctively, I rip emcees \n\nAnd spit the remains out, all over the floor \n\nIt's Big Wax mothafucka thought I told you before \n\nI'm on a whole different level than ya'll, leveling ya'll \n\nLike a medicine ball, hitting you dead in the jaw \n\nWe ready to brawl, you delicate soft, you gon' lose it \n\nHerbal T ride the mic and get stupid\n\n\n\nLearn to be original \n\nHerbs an individual \n\nNerds, are typical hypocritical pitiful minimal \n\nImpact makers, get to back breaking \n\nHard work it takes to get to that place \n\nWhere you can do whatever you want and still kill it \n\nPass your prescription bottle and we'll fill it \n\nUp with the true party music from the soul ya'll \n\nWax, Herbal T, LOA, is the roll call \n\nI thought I told ya'll not to press your luck \n\nLike tentacles of an octopus, you suck \n\nStraight trash, throw your CD in a waste basket \n\nOr I'mma cover your mouth with tape fast \n\nAnd pipe down your shitty talk \n\nThem brothers fly like Orville and Wilbur right down to Kitty Hawk \n\nAnd just when ya'll assholes thought that ya'll was on top \n\nLack of Afro brought that \n\nFall back when he lay the drum track \n\nThe bass on the joint on point like a thumbtack \n\nCrews come whack cause some lack the focus \n\nAnd if they fall off a come back it's hopeless \n\nUnpack the dopeness stored in my brain \n\nDear lord I'm insane \n\nIf you a dope fiend put my microphone cord in your vein \n\nAnd soon you'll be high like you're boarding a plane",
