Let it snow!\r\nOh, the weather outside is frightful\n\nBut the fire is so delightful\n\nAnd since we've no place to go\n\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\n\n\nIt doesn't show signs of stopping\n\nAnd I brought some corn for popping\n\nThe lights are turned way down low\n\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\n\n\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\n\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\n\nBut if you'll really hold me tight\n\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\n\n\nThe fire is slowly dying\n\nAnd my dear, we're still goodbye-ing\n\nBut as long as you love me so\n\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\n\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow!\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow!\n\n\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\n\n\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\n\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\n\nBut if you'll really hold me tight\n\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\n\n\nThe fire is slowly dying\n\nAnd my dear, we're still goodbye-ing\n\nBut as long as you love me so\n\nLet it snow! (Let it snow!)\n\nLet it snow! (Let it snow!)\n\nLet the north winds bluster and blow\n\nFor as long as we're alone here together like so\n\nLet it snow!",
