  "lyrics": "Gate 22, two hour delay\r\nShe was waitin' on a plane to L.A.\r\nI didn't see the harm in sittin' down at the wrong gate\r\nShe said, \"Hello, where you headed to?\"\r\nI didn't lie but I bent the truth\r\nSaid, \"I'd go anywhere with you\"\n\nAnd before long\n\n\n\nIt was midnight in the middle of JFK\n\nTryin' to take my mind off the fallin' rain\n\nI was sayin' anything to make her laugh\n\nNever wanted anything so bad\n\nShe got me wishin' that she could stay\n\nDoesn't even know that I've missed my plane\n\nNow there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade\n\nFor a ticket to L.A.\n\nYeah, yeah, a ticket to L.A\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n\n\nShe opened up after a drink\n\nSaid, she started law school in the spring\n\nAnd by the time that she had three\n\nI know almost everything\n\nLightnin' flashed across the sky\n\nI said, it probably wasn't safe to fly\n\nSecretly, I hoped that she'd be stuck with me all night\n\n\n\nIt was midnight in the middle of JFK\n\nTryin' to take my mind off the fallin' rain\n\nI was sayin' anything to make her laugh\n\nNever wanted anything so bad\n\nShe got me wishin' that she could stay\n\nDoesn't even know that I've missed my plane\n\nNow there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade\n\nFor a ticket to L.A.\n\n\n\nAnd now Gate 22 is callin' out her name\n\nShe wrote her number on my hand and walked away\n\n\n\nAlone here in the middle of JFK\n\nSittin' near the bar in an empty gate\n\nI'd do anything to bring her back\n\nNever wanted anything so bad\n\nShe got me wishin' that she could stay\n\nDoesn't even know that I've missed my plane\n\nNow there ain't a single thing I wouldn't trade\n\nFor a ticket to L.A.\n\nYeah, yeah, a ticket to L.A\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nA ticket to L.A., yeah\n\nA ticket to L.A.\n\nA ticket to L.A.\n\n\n\nA ticket to L.A., yeah, yeah",
