  "lyrics": "I'm an indecisive mess who stays up way too late most nights\r\nI'm the girl who acts so sane but thinks of you when I cry\r\nAnd I know I keep on joking but we're emotionally unstable\r\nBut it's 2AM and I keep my head up off this table\r\nBy the next day I'll just swipe away the reminiscence of time\r\nNow I'm ready to laugh at your shitty jokes and pretend to smile\n\n\n\nI'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue\n\nOnly problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues\n\nI'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS\n\n\n\nI'm the happy girl who's laughing all damn day when I'm around you\n\nWhen I'm alone I'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue\n\nBut it's nothing you can see because I'm so damn good at lying\n\nJust another night I'll be up late waiting for new lighting\n\n\n\nI'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue\n\nOnly problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues\n\nI'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS\n\n\n\nSo good at lying, so good at hiding\n\nSo good at lying, so good at hiding\n\nI'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS\n\nThe only problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues\n\n\n\nI'm calling SOS, waiting for your rescue\n\nOnly problem is I'm good at hiding all my issues\n\nI'm calling SOS, I'm calling SOS",
