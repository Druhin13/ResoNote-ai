  "lyrics": "I was alone, I was a fool\r\nLooking at YouTube\r\nThinking I knew you\r\nPicked up my phone, nothing to lose\r\nAll of a sudden it's kinda blue\n\nI get it, I messed up, you pushed it, I fell off\n\nYou'll always be better in your own eyes\n\nI get it, I messed up, you pushed it, I fell off\n\nYou'll always be better in your own eyes\n\n\n\nGoodbye my friend\n\nIt's been too long\n\nI know you've been away\n\nToo much was said\n\nToo much was done\n\nAnd now I'm wide awake\n\nAwake, awake, awake, awake\n\n\n\nI know it's too late, I know where it's left\n\nAnd now I see space in the bed that we slept\n\nThere's no way to change\n\nIt's been a short while\n\nThe only way up is accepting your smile\n\n\n\nI get it, I've messed up, you pushed it, I fell off\n\nYou'll always be better in your own eyes\n\nI get it, I've messed up, you pushed it, I fell off\n\nYou'll always be better in your own eyes\n\n\n\nGoodbye my friend\n\nIt's been too long\n\nI know you've been away\n\nToo much was said\n\nToo much was done\n\nAnd now I'm wide awake (yeah)\n\nAwake, awake, awake, awake\n\n\n\nAwake, awake, awake, awake\n\n\n\nGoodbye my friend\n\nIt's been too long\n\nI know you've been away\n\nToo much was said\n\nToo much was done\n\nAnd now I'm wide awake (yeah)\n\nAwake, awake, awake, awake\n\n\n\nAwake, awake, awake, awake",
