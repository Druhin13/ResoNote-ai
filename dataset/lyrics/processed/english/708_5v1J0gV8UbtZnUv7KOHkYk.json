You took your time\"\r\nWhen I met You at the corner of insanity\r\nI didn't know what I was doing, just wasting time\r\nIt was clear I couldn't see\n\n\n\nAnd You knew that I was looking for something or someone new\n\nI heard You knocking but I couldn't take the truth\n\nSee my reflection but I can't make out my face\n\nI thought I heard a whisper that You say\n\nI heard You say\n\n\n\nOoh, \"let 'em be forgiven\n\nLet 'em be, Father\"\n\nI heard You say\n\nOoh, \"welcome to the Kingdom\n\nMy sons and daughters\"\n\n\n\nI feel the sound of many waters [?] my thirst\n\nLike I wasn't even shining, started flickering\n\nA voice beyond my understanding, it pulled me in\n\nIt didn't matter where I've been\n\n\n\nAnd You knew that I was looking for something or someone new\n\nI heard You knocking but I couldn't take the truth\n\nSee my reflection but I can't make out my face\n\nI thought I heard a whisper that You say\n\nI heard You say\n\n\n\nOoh, \"let 'em be forgiven\n\nLet 'em be, Father\"\n\nI heard You say\n\nOoh, \"welcome to the Kingdom\n\nMy sons and daughters\"\n\nI heard You say\n\n\n\nOoh, \"let 'em be forgiven\n\nLet 'em be, Father\"\n\nI heard You say\n\nOoh, \"welcome to the Kingdom\n\nMy sons and daughters\"\n\n\n\nCome into the light\n\nCome into the light\n\nAll of Heaven's waiting for You\n\nJust step inside\n\nCome into the light\n\nCome into the light\n\nAll of Heaven's waiting for You\n\nJust step inside\n\nCome into the light\n\nCome into the light\n\nAll of Heaven's waiting for You\n\nJust step inside\n\nCome into the light\n\nCome into the light\n\nI've been waiting all this time\n\n\n\nOoh, \"let 'em be forgiven\n\nLet 'em be, Father\"\n\nI heard You say\n\nOoh, \"welcome to the Kingdom\n\nMy sons and daughters\"\n\nI heard You say\n\n\n\nOoh, \"let 'em be forgiven\n\nLet 'em be, Father\"\n\nI heard You say\n\nOoh, \"welcome to the Kingdom\n\nMy sons and daughters\"",
