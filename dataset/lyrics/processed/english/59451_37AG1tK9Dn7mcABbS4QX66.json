  "lyrics": "I met you in No Man's Land\r\nAcross the wire we were holding hands\r\nHearts a-bubble in the rubble\r\nIt was love at bomb site\r\nAll you give me is barbed wire love\n\nAll caught up in barbed wire love\n\nTangled up in barbed wire love\n\nThrow my leg over barbed wire love\n\nBarbed wire love snags my jeans\n\n\n\nWhen I fell it was awful nice\n\nCaught when not suspecting vice\n\nThe night was rife with wasteland life\n\nYou set my arm alight\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nBlasted by your booby traps\n\nI felt the blow in both knee-caps\n\nYour eyes did shine\n\nYour lips were fine\n\nAnd the device in your pants was out of site\n\n\n\n[Chorus]",
