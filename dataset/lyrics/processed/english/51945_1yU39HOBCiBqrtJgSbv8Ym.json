  "lyrics": "I can't begin to tell you how it feels\r\nIt's a clear blue sky\r\nOut here my heart so full it's fit to burst\r\nJust counting the hours\r\nHome, such a long way gone\r\nHow to share a day\n\nHere's my only way\n\nSend myself to you\n\nWishing you were here\n\n\n\nI can't begin to tell you where I've been \n\nIt's a world behind\n\nAnd if we are to find our heaven here\n\nWe just have to look harder\n\nNow I can see you\n\nI never could before\n\nNow I wand nothing more\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nWishing you were here\n\n\n\nHome such a long way gone\n\nHow to share a day\n\nHere's my only way\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nWishing you were here\n\n\n\nI can't begin to tell you how it feels",
