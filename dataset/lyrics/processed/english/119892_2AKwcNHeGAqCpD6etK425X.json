  "lyrics": "Dancing my underpants\r\nI'm gonna run for government \nI'm gonna form a covers band and all\r\nBack there by the baby grand\r\ndid Mr. Winter Wonderland say \n\"Come here kid, we really need to talk\"?\n\nBear with me, man, I lost my train of thought \n\n\n\nI fantasize, I call it quits,\n\nI swim with the economists\n\nAnd I get to the bottom of it for good\n\nBy the time reality hits,\n\nThe chines of freedom fell to bits\n\nThe shining city on the fritz\n\nThey come out of the cracks,\n\nThirsty for blood\n\n\n\nJust as the apocalypse, finally gets prioritised\n\nAnd you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried\n\nMultiplied by five\n\nI suppose a singer must die\n\n\n\n\"Singsong 'round the money tree\"\n\nThis stunning documentary \n\nthat no one else unfortunately saw\n\nSuch a beautiful photography, \n\nit's worth it for the opening scene \n\nI've been driving 'round listening to the score\n\nOr maybe I just imagined it all\n\nI've played to quiet rooms like this before \n\nBear with me, man, I lost my train of thought",
