  "lyrics": "You turn me on like a faucet\r\nAnd you left me running, drip, drip\r\n'Til my fossil fuels were exhausted\r\nYou filled your cup to the tip\r\nFlowers cannot bloom without precipitation\n\nAnd lovers will not last without reciprocation\n\n\n\nYou took your box of matches\n\nAnd you chopped down every stick\n\nI kept you warm 'til I was ashes\n\nWho taught you how to love like this?\n\n\n\nRivers cannot move without precipitation\n\nAnd love is bound to fail without reciprocation\n\n\n\nWell, you turn me on like a faucet\n\nAnd you left me running, drip, drip\n\n'Til my fossil fuels were exhausted\n\nYou filled your cup to the tip",
