  "lyrics": "The wound is festering, now rotting off my flesh\r\nSpreads like a cancer, poisoning the heart of\r\nWho I am\r\nSuffocating me\r\nYour eyes they call to me\n\nThey keep on giving me everything\n\nYour eyes they call to me\n\nThis pain has swallowed me\n\n\n\nRip it out\n\nRip it out of me\n\nRip it out\n\nYou can watch me bleed\n\n\n\nYou held my head and whispered everything to see\n\nHow could I know that I was just a pawn? Fuck you\n\n\n\nYour eyes they call to me\n\nThey keep on telling me what to think\n\nYour eyes they call to me\n\nThis pain has swallowed me\n\n\n\nCut it off clean, let the blood drain out\n\nLoving you is like salt in the wound\n\nCut it off clean, let the blood drain out\n\nLoving you is like salt in the wound\n\n\n\nRip it out\n\nRip it out of me\n\nRip it out\n\nYou can watch me bleed\n\n\n\nYour eyes they call to me\n\nThis pain has swallowed me",
