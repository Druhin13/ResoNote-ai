  "lyrics": "Our existence was coming to an end\r\nOur sources depleting, society dissolving into war\r\nWe knew it couldn't go on, but we did not know it could come to this\r\nA world rocked with refuse, poverty and despair\r\nWhen once this kind of society could only exist in dystopian fiction, this now is our startling reality\r\nA secluded few in this hopeless wasteland lived a life of opulence, while the majority suffered\n\nThe people of this new world are now split in two by creed\n\nOne side, obsessed with technological stride, discovering the lifestyle of lavishness\n\nThe others, seeking to reunite us with our primal instincts, rage against order and injustice\n\nTheir prime directive is to let humanity burn itself in order to start again\n\nPeople are starving as humanity tumbles further into complete chaos\n\nIs it better to selfish for the sake of progression or violent for the sake of reparation?\n\n\n\nWhich side will you chose; the wise or the wicked?",
