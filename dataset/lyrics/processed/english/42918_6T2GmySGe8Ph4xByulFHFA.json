  "lyrics": "Can I be honest with you?\r\nCan I tell you the truth?\r\nI never did mind the storm\r\nEven when my heart was torn\r\nThunder in the night sky\n\nRunning from a town like this\n\nCrashing with a stolen kiss\n\nWe're all glitter and tears in the moonlight\n\nAnd it came to me in a taxi ride\n\nHit me like a blinding light\n\nAnd my heart was beating so alive\n\nWanna find myself out in the wild\n\nOh I, oh I\n\n\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n(In the dark, in the night)\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n(Get it wrong, make it right)\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nTell me is that cool?\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n\n\nAin't gonna be afraid of fun\n\nGonna let my makeup run\n\nOh, see every sunrise\n\nFacing up to all my fears\n\nGonna find a way outta here\n\nWe're all glitter and tears in the moonlight\n\n\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n(In the dark, in the night)\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n(Get it wrong, make it right)\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nTell me is that cool?\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n\n\nBefore the sky was broken\n\nI can get in and out of trouble on my own\n\nJust don't leave me totally alone\n\nBaby, the world can see me dance\n\nThe universe was ours and then it disappeared\n\nBut the skies are still blue\n\nWith or without you\n\nAnd now I'm standing out here, in the crowd\n\nAnd I'm dancing\n\n\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n(In the dark, in the night)\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\n(Get it wrong, make it right)\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nTell me is that cool?\n\nI wanna get lost without you\n\nI wanna get lost without you",
