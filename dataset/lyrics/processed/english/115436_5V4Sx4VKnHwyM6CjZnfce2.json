  "lyrics": "Maybe it's a bad girl underneath that sweet smile\r\nLike a peak of black lace that nobody but me sees\r\nAnd just a trace of all the possibilities\r\nMaybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quarter wine\r\nAnd we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it\r\nEverything you're doing, girl, is my weakness\n\n\n\nI'm not good at not kissing again\n\nWhen you're leaning it all in a little closer\n\nI'm not good at not getting sidetracked\n\nWhen your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder\n\nWhoa, girl, I try to be\n\nBut I ain't that tough, I'm not good at not\n\nFalling in love, falling in love\n\nI'm falling in love\n\n\n\nYou know what to do girl, and you know what it does to me\n\nWhen you turn on that song and turn the lights down\n\nBaby I'm gone before the part about you\n\nDancing in slow motion with my hands on your hips\n\nNow you got me going right where I can't resist\n\n\n\nI'm not good at not kissing again\n\nWhen you're leaning it all in a little closer\n\nI'm not good at not getting sidetracked\n\nWhen your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder\n\nWhoa, girl, I try to be\n\nBut I ain't that tough, I'm not good at not\n\nFalling in love, falling in love\n\nI'm falling in love\n\n\n\nCan't tell you no, can't say goodbye\n\nCan't hold a little back even if I try\n\n'Cause when I look in your eyes...\n\n\n\nI'm not good at not kissing again\n\nWhen you're leaning it all in a little closer\n\nI'm not good at not getting sidetracked\n\nWhen your tank top strap's slipping off of your shoulder\n\nWhoa, girl, I try to be\n\nBut I ain't that tough, I'm not good at not\n\nFalling in love, falling in love\n\nI'm falling in love\n\nNot good at not falling in love, I'm falling in love\n\nI'm falling in love\n\nI'm not good at not falling\n\nI'm not good at not falling in love\n\nI'm not good at not falling\n\nFalling in love, falling in love",
