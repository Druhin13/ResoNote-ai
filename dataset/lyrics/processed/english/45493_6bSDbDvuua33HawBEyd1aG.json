  "lyrics": "In the cold of night\r\nStay at the heart of it\r\nI feel the love so\r\nI was holding on\r\nPray, I was scared of me\r\nYou, but the time is right\n\n'Cause in my heart I'll do the same for you\n\n\n\nIf the night is for the day\n\nYou won't see the last of me\n\nStay warm 'cause the rain will come through\n\n\n\nI wish I could be better\n\nI wish I could do better\n\nI hope this stays for better\n\nI'll be longing for peace anew\n\n\n\nWhen the highs are low\n\nYou better go\n\nYou barely hold the reins\n\nWhen the light goes down\n\nI'll let it shine\n\nYou see it's all a game\n\nOn the highest plane\n\nOf a fool who's the tracks again\n\n'Cause in my heart I'll do the same for you\n\n\n\nIf the night is for the day\n\nYou won't see the last of me\n\nStay warm 'cause the rain will come through\n\n\n\nI wish I could be better\n\nI wish I could do better\n\nI hope this stays for better\n\nI'll be longing for peace anew\n\n\n\nHigh up in the clouds\n\nMoving like a spinwheel\n\nCloser to the sky\n\nI will feel the sorrow\n\nBut the night is full of day\n\nI'mma hold on to life\n\nI won't wait on this [?]\n\nWait in this hopeless life\n\nWait in this lonely life\n\nI won't be the best of me\n\n\n\nI wish I could be better\n\nI wish I could do better\n\nI hope this stays for better\n\nI'll be longing for peace anew\n\n\n\n'Cause the night is for the day\n\nI can see the rest of me\n\nHopin' the light is the only way I'll fly",
