  "lyrics": "It's my song\r\nAnd I sing for the man in the wings\r\nIs it strange\r\nWhen we never have shared anything\r\nI don't ache for some tender exchange\n\nIn the dark - that will pass\n\nBut the purest refrain\n\nWill haunt us again\n\nAnd he has that with me\n\nWhen I've nothing to bring\n\nI sing for the man in the wings\n\n\n\nWe won't speak\n\nHe won't ask me to follow him home\n\nAnd his name\n\nIf I ever did know it, is gone\n\n\n\nBack to back\n\nI can hear his pulse racing with mine\n\nBoth in time\n\nI'll be waiting for him\n\nBefore I begin each line\n\nAnd he won't mind\n\nThat I've nothing to bring\n\nWhen I sing for the man in the wings\n\n\n\nAnd they tell me he walks alone\n\nIt is said that he is stone\n\nWithout knowing the shape of him\n\nI am certain they are wrong\n\nWe meet in a different place\n\nMe, the man and the song\n\n\n\nI don't long\n\nFor some fleeting exchange in the dark\n\nThat will pass\n\nBut the purest refrain\n\nWill haunt us again\n\nAnd he has that with me\n\nWhen we've nothing to bring\n\nI sing for the man in the wings",
