  "lyrics": "Alone\r\nOne man, one man can change the mind of a woman if he tries\r\nHe might use truth, he might use lies\r\nAnd it don't seem to matter much of what he says or what he does\r\nAs he tries in vain to show the kind of love he has to give\r\nAnd through a sieve, the words go down the drain\n\n\n\nYes, men and women equal\n\nBut we're not the same\n\n\n\nAlone\n\nOne woman, one woman all alone she can change a man\n\nShe'll do all that she can\n\nTrying hard to figure out what's already been done\n\nBefore he was her husband, he was just some poor woman's son\n\nAnd she's not suggesting someone else might be to blame\n\n\n\nJust, men and women equal\n\nBut we're not the same\n\n\n\nAlone\n\nWe all start, we all start out alone and seek a mystery all our own\n\nSo let the heart beat out its ancient tone\n\nAnd let all those lovers seek to find\n\nTo open up their hearts and open their minds\n\nAnd may one take the other's last name\n\n\n\nYes, men and women equal\n\nBut we're not the same",
