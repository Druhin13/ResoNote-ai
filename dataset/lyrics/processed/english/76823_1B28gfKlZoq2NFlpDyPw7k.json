  "lyrics": "The sky is red, I don't understand,\r\nPast midnight I still see the land.\r\nPeople are sayin' the woman is damned,\r\nShe makes you burn with a wave of her hand.\r\nThe city's a blaze, the town's on fire.\r\nThe woman's flames are reaching higher.\n\nWe were fools, we called her liar.\n\nAll I hear is \"Burn!\"\n\n\n\nI didn't believe she was devil's sperm.\n\nShe said, \"Curse you all, you'll never learn!\n\nWhen I leave there's no return.\"\n\nThe people laughed till she said, \"Burn!\"\n\nWarning came, no one cared.\n\nEarth was shakin', we stood and stared.\n\nWhen it came no one was spared.\n\nStill I hear \"Burn!\"\n\n\n\nYou know we had no time,\n\nWe could not even try.\n\nYou know we had no time.\n\n\n\nYou know we had no time,\n\nWe could not even try.\n\nYou know we had no time.\n\n\n\nThe sky is red, I don't understand,\n\nPast midnight I still see the land.\n\nPeople are sayin' the woman is damned,\n\nShe makes you burn with a wave of her hand.\n\nWarning came, no one cared.\n\nEarth was shakin, we stood and stared.\n\nWhen it came no one was spared.\n\nStill I hear \"Burn!\"",
