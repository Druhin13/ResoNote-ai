  "lyrics": "Back in Brazil\r\nThere lives a girl\r\nDreams of the future\r\nAnd a far, far better world\r\nBack in Brazil\n\nShe meets a man\n\nHe's tall and handsome\n\nAnd he fits in with her plan\n\n\n\nBright lights ahead\n\nMusic and fun\n\nNights are for dancing\n\nAnd the days are for the sun\n\nAll kinds of weather will surely come and go\n\nBut they're together\n\nAnd together they will steal the show\n\n\n\nIchiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!\n\nIchiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!\n\nIchiban! Ban! Ban!\n\nBan! Ban! Ban! Ban!\n\n\n\nBack in Brazil\n\nShe makes a date\n\nHe has to cancel\n\n'Cause they got him working late\n\n\n\nBack in Brazil\n\nShe feels afraid\n\nHope starts to crumble\n\nAnd her dreams begin to fade\n\n\n\nHer lights are out\n\nShe's gone to bed\n\nNights are for sleeping\n\nIf a girl's to get ahead\n\nEven the weather\n\nHas started changing too\n\nBut they'll be together\n\nAnd together they will make it through\n\n\n\nIchiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!\n\nIchiban! Ichiban! Ichiban!\n\nIchiban!\n\nSo we raise a family as the clouds roll by\n\nMaking pictures of us in the sky\n\nThe kids are happy and they don't ask why\n\nPa-pa-pa-pa-pa you and I",
