  "lyrics": "I'm on the high ridge looking down\r\nWhile we're evolving, I get old\r\nIf I get back then I'll be grateful\r\nLook there's a billboard on the moon\r\nLet me take you this far\n\nThis crossing isn't much to me\n\nThere's lightning in the storm clouds\n\nAnd I'll send you there to stay\n\n\n\nYou got me lost in Magic City\n\nYou got me questioning it all\n\nI hope that I make it home by Wednesday\n\nAnd this Magic City lets me go\n\n\n\nMagic City\n\nMagic City\n\nMagic City\n\nMagic City\n\n\n\nYou put me up here in the penthouse\n\nAnd painted me in red, white and blue\n\nI filled the canyons with my ego\n\nLook there's a billboard on the moon\n\n\n\nYou got me lost in Magic City\n\nYou got me questioning it all\n\nI hope that I make it home by Wednesday\n\nAnd this Magic City lets me go",
