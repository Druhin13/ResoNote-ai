  "lyrics": "I prayed that the light in me to not only be held inside of me, but free the wrong with the right in me\r\nBecause the demon I was they won't confide in me!\r\nI come from a religious background being raised a Christian of Barker Temple Church of God & Christ\r\nAlso studying Islam from 12 to 17 after my Christian Mother married a Muslim!\r\nMom loved that I rapped she wanted me to do it for Christ\n\nBut the worldly me began when I ran away from home at 17 & no matter how much better of a person I became\n\nThe worldly things I did would catch up with me & try to pull me right back down!\n\n\n\nI come from it, but it seems impossible to run from it!\n\nAll the evil I did to people then none could stomach?\n\nNo cause when my spirits go up now every one plummets\n\nI can light all, with this angel but that demon will make the brightfall\n\nWhen your angle is to reason with those who night crawl\n\nPsycho searchin so they get even with a life you lost and was leavin\n\nBut it might be costin this season when the fight calls!\n\nPeople change their life of sin\n\nThen try to negate the back they aimed the knife within\n\nA shame, I can with the game and be nice to friends then bang\n\nMy revenge it came to wipe this grin then pain\n\nFight your demons id advise it, its there no matter how you try to hide it\n\nIn private you're running from the people that despise it\n\nDon't you lie and deny this sick hybrid\n\nAngel demon ain't no leavin either one\n\nCan't take it back where you got this evil from\n\nThis magnitude the angel will need a gun!\n\nSo much evil I saw, in the past i was bad now I'm right yall\n\nBut the evil remains to make the brightfall!\n\n\n\nGod knows I'm trying\n\nIt seems like I'm always fighting for my life\n\nFor my soul\n\nThis won't bring me down!\n\n\n\nAll I want is heaven but the evil forces they follow me\n\nPlottin on my body to attempt to torch it or hollow me\n\nI cannot let the depths of hell to rise up & swallow me\n\nI'm tryna make it where the other angels & God'll be\n\nThis is terrible fightin the past me is unbearable\n\nNever really mattered if my symbols & outfit were clerical\n\nJudging today for past demons make me hysterical\n\nDarkness is blinding take me back in the city of Jericho\n\nDarkness will not win my heart is really not grim\n\nBut the chances of me becoming pure angel has got slim\n\nI'm stuck and I'm blocked in\n\nBrightness the plots been wanna frolic in God\n\nI'm lookin for solace but it got dim\n\nHow can I detach from the past heinous acts\n\nWill I last\n\nWill they attack with a blast?\n\nWhen the night calls, it's gonna be a nice brawl\n\nFor the darkness to come and make my brightfall!\n\nOoh Awws\n\n\n\nGet it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix\n\nRid it out! Don't ever wanna see, what that pit about\n\nWe just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out\n\nI'm fighting for a bright life, but evil wanna consume me\n\nAnd my soul is the right price!\n\nThat would literally be a fright night\n\nBut I ain't sellin' my soul to hell\n\nAngels yellin' propellin' flight heights\n\nWanna spread those angel wings\n\nBut they have wicked entangled things\n\nLike steaming hot tar with the stench of brimstone\n\nKnee in God's yard\n\nCan I repent the sin gone?\n\nDid that done that then the evil comes back\n\nRunnin' from myself it seems it ain't no runnin' from that!\n\nJust when you wanna start anew\n\nThey judge you on what you used to be\n\nThus makin' it harder too!\n\nBut I refuse to lose\n\nEven if I gotta be banged and bruised\n\nWhy do we have to battle\n\nJust to go the bright route\n\nOh well I'm bout to beat this hell until it's lights out\n\n\n\nAlive and I'm well, did I win in hell?\n\nThe fight just to save my soul!\n\nCause time and time again\n\nWhen I crawl to the light I land in sin\n\nNow my sins so far away\n\nThat darkness will never find me!\n\nHideous hideous grotesque grotesque",
