  "lyrics": "I can hear you talking from across the room\r\nAdding more stuff [?] to that honey-do\r\nList but honey I ain't listening\r\nMind keeps drifting out and in\r\nLike the pull of the tide on a florida shore\r\nThinking I can't take this no more\n\nPaint that fence, mow that grass\n\nYou can kiss my sandy ass\n\n\n\nBeach, please, I'm up to my knees\n\nIn crystal blue water with a tropical breeze\n\nCooler full of cold Corona\n\nGirl now if you wanna find me\n\nYou know where I'll be\n\nI'll be laying in a hammock 'tween some coconut trees\n\nDon't wake me up from this dream\n\nBeach please\n\n\n\nYou keep I'm saying I'm good for nothing\n\nHey now everybody's good at something\n\nI can shotgun beer like no-one's business\n\nNot a single drip, God is my witness\n\nMight as well go ahead and take a pill\n\nAin't nobody gonna melt my chill\n\nSaid I'll get to it, baby I will\n\nAs soon as I get back\n\n\n\nFrom the beach, please, I'm up to my knees\n\nIn crystal blue water with a tropical breeze\n\nCooler full of cold Corona\n\nGirl now if you wanna find me\n\nYou know where I'll be\n\nI'll be laying in a hammock 'tween some coconut trees\n\nDon't wake me up from this dream\n\nBeach please\n\n\n\nBeach, please, I'm up to my knees\n\nIn crystal blue water with a tropical breeze\n\nCooler full of cold Corona\n\nAin't nobody gonna find me\n\n'Cause I'm gonna be a million miles away under some coconut trees\n\nDon't wake me up from this dream\n\nBeach please\n\nOh beach please\n\nDon't wake me up from this dream\n\nBeach please",
