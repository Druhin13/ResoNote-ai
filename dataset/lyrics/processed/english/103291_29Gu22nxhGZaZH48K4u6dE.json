You also have to be a smooth talker\r\nNinja Brian: (silence)\r\nDanny: Well, of course I know how to talk to women! Give me a delicious groove, this is what I tell them\r\nGirl, I'm gonna take my flang-diddly out and slam it your floup\r\nThat's right\n\nThen, without a sound, I'll run my tongue all up and down your horse pa-cuck\n\nYou like that?\n\nThen, I'll flip you 'round and lay you down and rub my canck up on your schmears (all over your schmears)\n\nYour cliver will start to quiver when I grab your stanky ? by the fears\n\n\n\nOH!\n\nOpen your heart and give me a taste off your fork\n\nI'm gonna light this ? flame, a ???\n\nThen I will gently flick your tourffles, baby!\n\nTil you scream \"Oh my God I'm gon-na crum-ble it SO HARD!\"\n\nDamn, that's some smooth talking\n\nPlenty more where that came from\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we go baby. Now it's-\n\nOh my god, a guitar solo, ok...\n\n\n\n\n\nNo it's time to take my tiddly bits and mash them til they gub\n\nI've got two nasty doo-dads and they're beggin for a moment with your shnunb\n\nMy sackitty-pack is a figgity-figgity facking and it's only attack will be a mac pack in your coo\n\nWe're gonna mate til we're ? like two ? and I please you with my shmoo\n\nDinner is served and looks my bogoick is the main dish\n\nSo sit down and gobble my sporkle if you wish!\n\nTo have a taste of my flappy-swish\n\n\n\nLet her go, Ninja Brian. She's probably just...going to think about it. Well, if you need me, I'll be in my chambers...SCHNUBBING MY OWN GANK",
