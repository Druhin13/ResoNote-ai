  "lyrics": "I woke up - depressed as fuck\r\nI wanna sit around and tell you how it sucks\r\nHow it's hard to walk with spaghetti legs\r\nAnd a mind that's freaking out about the world we're in\r\nI feel like quicksand's\r\nSucking me down to my last limb\n\nI'm at the bottom of the ocean and I can't swim\n\nI'm at the bottom of the ocean\n\nAnd I might just quit\n\n\n\nI keep the TV on to drown out the sound\n\nMy mind is way too loud\n\nMy mind's way too loud\n\nI keep the TV on to drown out the sound\n\nMy mind is way too loud\n\nMy mind's way too loud\n\nShh\n\n\n\nWent to bed feeling sick again\n\nI try to stop the voices in my head\n\nHolding on tight while my room spins\n\nTake a deep breath as the fear sets in\n\nI love distractions\n\nTaking my mind off of life 'cause\n\nEverything thing about it makes me anxious\n\nEvery single day I try to cope with it\n\n\n\nI keep the TV on to drown out the sound\n\nMy mind is way too loud\n\nMy mind's way too loud\n\nI keep the TV on to drown out the sound\n\nMy mind is way too loud\n\nMy mind's way too loud\n\nShh\n\n\n\nI keep the TV on to drown out the sound\n\nMy mind is way too loud\n\nMy mind's way too loud\n\nI keep the TV on to drown out the sound\n\nMy mind is way too loud\n\nMy mind's way too loud\n\nShh\n\n\n\nTV on, TV on, TV on, TV on\n\nDrown it, drown it, drown it, drown it\n\nDon't turn off the TV please",
