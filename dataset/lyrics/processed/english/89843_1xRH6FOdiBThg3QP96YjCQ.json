  "lyrics": "Everybody prays to God by different names, tell me your version\r\nYou don’t have to play it down or fake it\r\nDon’t give me that bullshit\r\nDriving in the parking lot in the ‘cedes with counterfeit leather\r\nLooking like a circus clown gone crazy when we are together\n\nHeaven don’t play like violins\n\nI been up over mountains\n\nYou’re not a book that I read\n\nBut I know how you love me\n\n\n\nBut I know how you love me\n\n\n\nEverybody frames the stars in silhouettes, a great exhibition\n\nEven if the fates are wrong or innocent, we all wanna listen\n\nBut it doesn’t pay to wait for so long on just a reflection\n\nIf you want to cash your stake in the answers\n\nThen ask me the questions\n\n\n\nHeaven don’t play like violins\n\nI been up over mountains\n\nYou’re not a book that I read\n\nBut I know how you love me\n\n\n\nI can’t relax, I can’t be still, moving too fast\n\nTell me, what can I do?\n\nI can’t relax if I can’t be still, moving too fast\n\nAm I moving too fast?",
