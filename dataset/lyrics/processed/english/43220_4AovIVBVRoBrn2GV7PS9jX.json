  "lyrics": "Someone told someone and someone told you\nBut they wouldn't hurt you, not much\nSince everyone spread the story \nWith his own little personal touch\n\n[Chorus]\n\nDo nothin' till you hear from me\n\nPay no attention to what's said\n\nWhy people tear the seam of anyone's dream\n\nIs over my head\n\nDo nothin' till you hear from me\n\nAt least consider our romance\n\nIf you should take the word of others you've heard\n\nI haven't a chance\n\n\n\nTrue, I've been seen with someone new\n\nBut does that mean that I'm untrue?\n\nWhen we're apart, the words in my heart\n\nReveal how I feel about you\n\nSome kiss may cloud my memory\n\nAnd other arms may hold a thrill\n\nBut, please, do nothin' till you hear it from me\n\nAnd you never will\n\nDo nothin' till you hear from me\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nTrue, I've been seen with someone new\n\nBut does that mean that I'm untrue?\n\nWhen we're apart, the words in my heart\n\nReveal how I feel about you\n\nSome kiss may cloud my memory\n\nAnd other arms may hold a thrill\n\nBut, please, do nothin' till you hear it from me\n\nAnd you never will",
