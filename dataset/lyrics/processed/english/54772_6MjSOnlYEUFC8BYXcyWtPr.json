  "lyrics": "Goodnight was just a little word you learned.\r\nSomewhere somebody that you burned\r\nWas all too happy with a lie\r\nBut love, you know you never got it right\r\nI don't know why you say goodnight\n\nYou only mean to say goodbye\n\n\n\nAnd I know you quick to show your lover to the door\n\nAnd you ain't never been in love before\n\nYou're only bound to get it wrong\n\n\n\nAnd I know you're just a victim of your circumstance\n\nI never know in any real romance\n\nAnd so we ought to say so long, goodbye, so long\n\nGoodbye\n\n\n\nI know you're only trying to ease my mind\n\nBut I'm a lay it on the line, this time\n\nYou only need to say goodbye\n\n\n\nOh, love, you know you never got it right\n\nI don't know why you say goodnight\n\nYou only mean to say goodbye [x4]",
