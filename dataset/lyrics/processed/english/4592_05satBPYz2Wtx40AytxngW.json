  "lyrics": "Shadows are falling, and I’ve been here all day\r\nIt’s too hot to sleep, and time is running away\r\nFeel like my soul has, turned into steel\r\nI’ve still got the scars, that the sun didn’t heal\r\nThere’s not even room enough, to be anywhere\n\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n\n\n\nWell, my sense of humanity, has gone down the drain\n\nBehind every beautiful thing, there’s been some kind of pain\n\nShe wrote me a letter, and she wrote it so kind\n\nShe put down in writing, what was in her mind\n\nI just don’t see why I should even care\n\n\n\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n\n\n\nWell, I’ve been to London, and I’ve been to gay Paris\n\nI’ve followed the river, and I got to the sea\n\nI’ve been down to the bottom, of a world full of lies\n\nI ain’t lookin for nothing, in anyone’s eyes\n\nSometimes my burden, is more than I can bear\n\n\n\nIt’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there\n\n\n\nI was born here, and I’ll die here, against my will\n\nI know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still\n\nEvery nerve in my body, is so naked and numb\n\nI can’t even remember what it was, I came here to get away from\n\nDon’t even hear a murmur of a prayer\n\n\n\nAnd it's not dark yet, but it's getting there\n\nEvery nerve in my body, is so naked and numb\n\nAnd it's not dark yet, but it's getting there",
