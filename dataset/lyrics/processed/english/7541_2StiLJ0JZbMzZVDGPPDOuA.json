  "lyrics": "It's the doctor\r\nLate night, laying in bed\r\nThoughts running through my head\r\nCan't sleep, your scent on my sheets\r\nWishing that you never left\n\nI overthink everything, don't trust nobody but me\n\nI chase everyone away, too scared to share what I've seen\n\n\n\nYou're lucky that you left me\n\nGot a lot of things I can't admit\n\nMy bag is too heavy\n\nDon't want to make you carry all my shit\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\n\n\nI feel alone but I don't want nobody near me\n\nI want to fit in so I sipped on a pint of that lean\n\nIt isn't your fault, in the end I just know it's my brain\n\nIt's better you left cause I know that I would leave you in pain\n\n\n\nYou're lucky that you left me\n\nGot a lot of things I can't admit\n\nMy bag is too heavy\n\nDon't want to make you carry all my shit\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nYou're lucky that you left me\n\nGot a lot of things I can't admit\n\nMy bag is too heavy\n\nDon't want to make you carry all my shit\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that 3 A.M. anxiety\n\nI got that (got that, got that, got that)",
