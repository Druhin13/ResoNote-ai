  "lyrics": "I surrender to the power of your pencil\r\nMy adventure, do your love, it's gonna end soon\r\nSo remember, send the mob into the temple\r\nMy protector, perceives persay\r\nI never meant to love you\n\nI never meant to make you feel the same as me\n\nI never meant to love you\n\n(And now that I know, knew that I knew better)\n\nBut you should know, know that I will be ready\n\nWhen you call your vultures, yeah\n\n(Ay! Ay! Ay!)\n\n\n\nWelcome to my body\n\nMy legs tired and my bones itch for some darkness\n\nFeed me 'till I'm heartless\n\nI will go bad, bad, bad as I need to be for the garbage\n\nSweet release of piranhas to the carcass\n\nAll stupid artists\n\nBet you bussing tables or cussing labels out\n\n\n\nI never meant to love you\n\nI never meant to make you feel the same as me\n\nI never meant to love you\n\n(And now that I know, knew that I knew better)\n\nBut you should know, know that I will be ready\n\nWhen you call your vultures, yeah\n\n(Ay! Ay! Ay!)\n\n\n\nI told my best friend 'bout the first time\n\nFirst time I saw you\n\nI told my best friend 'bout the best times\n\nBest times we had\n\nI told my best friend 'bout the first time\n\nFirst time you pulled up\n\nI told my best friend 'bout the last time\n\nLast time I left\n\nI told my best friend 'bout the first time\n\nFirst time you said it\n\nI told my best friend never let me go back again",
