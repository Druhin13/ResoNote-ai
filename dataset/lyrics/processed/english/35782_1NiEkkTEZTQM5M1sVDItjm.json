  "lyrics": "Follow me down and I'll show you the way\r\nTo where the broad grove carries into the Bay\r\nYou have the time, you've got something to say\r\nI'll let you walk with me, down to the bay?\r\nNow many times many are the ones who have gone\n\nInto that dark, mysterious dawn\n\nCarry a light, try to pass it on\n\nBut you worry when you find that it's fading\n\n\n\nFollow me down and I'll show you the way\n\nTo where the broad grove carries into the Bay\n\nYou have the time, you've got something to say\n\nI'll let you walk with me, down to the bay?\n\n\n\nWoke up in the morning and you put your hat on\n\nWent out to the sidewalk, it's icy\n\nOut there before the crowds\n\nThe streets are quiet and calm\n\nBut you better get used to surely noise build\n\nWent out walking with my headphones on\n\nClassical Indian ragga, twenty minutes long\n\nThen I listened to, old American folk songs\n\nLittle bit shorter still a lot going on\n\n\n\nFollow me down and I'll show you the way\n\nTo where the broad grove carries into the Bay\n\nYou have the time, you've got something to say\n\nI'll let you walk with me, down to the bay?\n\n\n\nI hit a pretty good stride, pretty far on my way\n\nDown by the water, just waiting\n\nGenerally pretty hard, but a bit easier today\n\nTo find the right kind of focus, contemplating\n\nOh Crystal, I, been looking for a sign\n\nGot stuck in a window that's painting\n\nFor a second or more, you would knock on the door\n\nYou forget why your life seems so crazy\n\n\n\nFollow me down and I'll show you the way\n\nTo where the broad grove carries into the Bay\n\nYou have the time, you've got something to say\n\nI'll let you walk with me, down to the bay?",
