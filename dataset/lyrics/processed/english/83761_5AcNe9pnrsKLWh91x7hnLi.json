  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Cold Feet par Above & Beyond\r\n[Justine Suissa]\nYou came with your troubled eyes\nOh, and the push and pull of love's desires\nYou came with your easy smile\nOh, and your pretty words like coloured birds fly away\n\n[Justine Suissa]\nI don't wanna burn for you\nI don't wanna yearn for you\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\nBut I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet\n\n[Justine Suissa]\nWhen you leave you leave no clues\nSo I reinvent the things you meant\n\nAll of this undeclared charade\nKeeps me so unsure, always wanting more every day\n\n[Justine Suissa]\nI don't wanna burn for you\nI don't wanna yearn for you\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)\nBut I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet\n\n[ Justine Suissa]\nYou stay to say the things you say\nA long embrace, you walk away\nAnd now my eyes are full of light\nAs I pretend that it's okay\n\n[Justine Suissa]\nI don't wanna burn for you\n\nI don't wanna yearn for you\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)\nBut I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet\n\nI don't wanna burn for you (I don't want to burn for you)\nI don't wanna yearn for you\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat (Know that I would lose myself)\nBut I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet\n\n[Justine Suissa]\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\n(Know that I would lose myself)\nBut I don't wanna get trampled by your cold feet\n(Know that I would lose myself)",
