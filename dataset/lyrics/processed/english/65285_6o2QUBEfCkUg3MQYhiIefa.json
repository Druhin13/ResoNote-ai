  "lyrics": "I think we spent too long\r\nLiving our lives through the eyes of another\r\nTell us we're not that strong\r\nBut I feel alive, knowing we got each other\r\nI know the storm is coming\n\nBut trust me we'll outrun it\n\nHear my heartbeat drumming\n\nAn open road is calling\n\nAren't you tired of stalling\n\nAlmost feels like falling\n\n\n\nTonight we're gonna find the key\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\nSo try, open your eyes and see\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\n\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\n\n\nIt's gonna be alright\n\nAll of the ghosts are fading behind us\n\nAnd don't you dare apologize\n\nWe got the scars on our hearts to remind us\n\n\n\nI know the storm is coming\n\nBut trust me we'll outrun it\n\nHear my heartbeat drumming\n\nAn open road is calling\n\nAren't you tired of stalling\n\nAlmost feels like falling\n\n\n\nTonight we're gonna find the key\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\nSo try, open your eyes and see\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\n\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\n\n\nDon't hide your feelings, now's not the time\n\nThe rhythm you're hearing is your lifeline\n\nJust give me a reason, show me a sign\n\nWe'll fight for our freedom\n\n\n\nTonight we're gonna find the key\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\nSo try, open your eyes and see\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\n\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free\n\nSo baby follow me 'cause we are gonna be free",
