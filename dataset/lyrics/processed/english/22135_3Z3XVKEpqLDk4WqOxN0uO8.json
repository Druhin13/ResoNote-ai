  "lyrics": "I've been hurtin' behind the pine curtain\r\nTore up in Cherokee County\r\nI'm blowin' smoke until I'm ready to choke\r\nI'm shootin' liquor, I'm feelin rowdy\r\n'Cause she ain't never comin' back\n\nThe girl's got Dallas on her mind\n\nIn my country shack\n\nI'll be sippin' cornshine 'til I'm blind\n\nI'll be drinkin' cornshine\n\n\n\nI've been hurtin' behind the pine curtain\n\nStrung out on a binge\n\nWe had a baby and she drove off with my boy, y'all\n\nThat's when I came unhinged\n\n'Cause she ain't never comin' back\n\n\n\nThe girl's got Dallas on her mind\n\nIn my country shack\n\nI'll be sippin' cornshine 'til I'm blind\n\nI'll be sippin' cornshine\n\n\n\nWell about the time we hit Big D\n\nThis jar of liquor starts a-workin' on me\n\nWe both wake up in a different place\n\nMan, that's just the cold hard facts\n\n'Cause she ain't never comin' back\n\n\n\nI've been hurtin' behind the pine curtain\n\nHer people say the boy looks like me\n\nI cranked my Hemi and I drove my Barracuda\n\nDown DFW I-20\n\nWell she ain't never comin' back\n\n\n\nThe girl's got Dallas on her mind\n\nIn my country shack\n\nI'll be sippin' cornshine 'til I'm blind\n\nI'll be sippin' cornshine",
