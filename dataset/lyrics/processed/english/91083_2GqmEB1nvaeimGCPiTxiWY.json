  "lyrics": "Tell me you hate me, just tell me something\r\nLay it all on the table\r\n'Cause sooner or later, it's back again\r\nI know that I messed up, no misunderstanding\r\nBut, darling, I need ya to blame me\r\n'Cause your silence won't make me a better man\n\nYou make me a better man\n\n\n\nSo how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell me you think I deserve this\n\nTell me now, what should I do?\n\n'Cause I'm standing paralysed\n\nYou had it so good, I'm just selfish\n\nBut I know you're hurting too\n\nTalking at you and there's no reply\n\nStaring at me from the other side\n\nFeels like you're gone, feels like you're gone\n\nSo how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell if you think it's worthless\n\nTell me if I'm losing you\n\n\n\nI know that you're too proud to let it go easy\n\nIf you got nothing to say\n\nWe're just gonna waste all of the good days\n\nSo I keep on asking, though I'm getting nothing\n\nDarling, I've made my mistakes\n\nAnd I'm begging to pay but you're not listening\n\nI know you're not listening\n\n\n\nSo how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell me you think I deserve this\n\nTell me now, what should I do?\n\n'Cause I'm standing paralysed\n\nYou had it so good, I'm just selfish\n\nBut I know you're hurting too\n\nTalking at you and there's no reply\n\nStaring at me from the other side\n\nFeels like you're gone, feels like you're gone\n\nSo how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell if you think it's worthless\n\nTell me if I'm losing you\n\n\n\nTalking at you and there's no reply\n\nStaring at me from the other side\n\nFeels like you're gone, feels like you're gone\n\nSo how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell if you think it's worthless\n\nTell me if I'm losing you\n\n\n\nSo how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell me you think I deserve this\n\nTell me now, what should I do?\n\nWell, how can you sleep at night?\n\nTell if you think it's worthless\n\nTell me if I'm losing you",
