  "lyrics": "You can love it, you can leave it\r\nAnd say you're nothing without it\r\nDon't let them keep you down\r\nWhat if I don't need it? There's something about it\r\nThat just freaks me out\r\nI just want another minute with it, fuck up little, what's the use?\n\nNever superficial you don't know it when it hit you\n\nGet a little sentimental when I'm off the juice\n\n\n\nYeah, okay we colder than the breeze\n\nBut the breeze ain't flowin' like me, motherfucker hol' up\n\nYou don't need to hol' up, yeah\n\nAnd I can show you how I seem what it is what it truly might be\n\nNothing that you know of, you don't need to hol' up\n\nI'm so above from beyond you take drugs to make it up\n\nWay up where we on, space shuttle, Elon\n\nTime we don't waste much, fuck and we wake up\n\nThen have her sing just like CÃ©line Dion\n\nCatch me if you can but, you never catch me damn\n\nWhole lotta \"yes I am\"\n\nAll the way in with no exit plan\n\nAlready left and the jet don't land\n\nYeah, the time is ticking\n\nCome take a ride, get inside, this is highly different\n\nI'm talking fly like a pilot would\n\nCan I mind my business? Why you trippin'?\n\nGive you somethin' that your eyes can witness\n\nOoh, too close\n\nI don't understand why you doing the most\n\n\n\nYou can love it, you can leave it\n\nAnd say you're nothing without it\n\nDon't let them keep you down\n\nWhat if I don't need it? There's something about it\n\nThat just freaks me out\n\nI just want another minute with it, fuck up little, what's the use?What's the use?\n\nNever superficial you don't know it when it hit you\n\nGet a little sentimental when I'm off the juice\n\n\n\nWhen I'mma give you what you came for, yeah\n\nShoulda perk too hard to have a clue who you are\n\nSet the bar so far but par we can parlay all day\n\nCrib long range with the yard\n\nI know I should probably pray more but you gotta love me\n\n'Cuz I save the day spendin' money\n\nWhen I had nothing shit it wasn't so funny\n\nMade a promise to the homies nobody go hungry\n\nLook how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name\n\nBut it never worried my brain\n\nHeads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'\n\nTell the sun get up outta my shade\n\nIf they don't get the picture, cut 'em out of my frame, shit\n\nI'm up 30 thou miles plus change\n\nSpend a while but I'm down 'till I'm out\n\nAnd it is what it is 'til it ain't\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can love it, you can leave it\n\nAnd say you're nothing without it\n\nDon't let them keep you down\n\nWhat if I don't need it? There's something about it\n\nThat just freaks me out\n\nI just want another minute with it, fuck up little, what's the use?\n\nWhat's the use?\n\nNever superficial you don't know it when it hit you\n\nGet a little sentimental when I'm off the juice\n\n\n\nYou can love it\n\nIt just freaks me out",
