  "lyrics": "You're lovely, but looks can kill\r\nYou're a septic cloud, but I'm breathing still\r\nIt's not right, you take it all\r\nStill I listen, and return your call\r\nOh\n\nToxin, got my temperature rising\n\nOur love finally taking its toll\n\nIt's incredible how quickly I lost me\n\nAnd I just can't take you no more\n\n\n\nYou're lowly, you drag me down\n\nJust burned up ash left on the ground\n\nNo vision, you've made me blind\n\nSmoke signals burn into my eyes\n\nOh\n\n\n\nToxin, got my temperature rising\n\nOur love finally taking its toll\n\nIt's incredible how quickly I lost me\n\nAnd I just can't take you no more\n\n\n\nNa na na, na na na na\n\nNananana, na na na na",
