  "lyrics": "Open your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through the dark times, the dark times\r\nHold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through the dark times, the dark times\r\nI remember a time when I was young and blind\r\nCouldn't take the fall from anything at all\r\nI blamed it on everybody else (I blamed it on everybody else)\n\nLike the New World Order, the Illuminati, as long as it wasn't me\n\nI was afraid of the mirror, of what I would see\n\nI didn't wanna see me\n\n\n\nOpen your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through the dark times, the dark times\n\nHold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through the dark times, the dark times\n\nIf the sky is always raining black, if the world is always stabbing you in the back\n\nOpen your eyes and you will find that we all live broken lives\n\n\n\nWe all live broken lives\n\nI was in this hole of the people's love\n\nHung up on why, I didn't have their lives\n\nI blamed it on everybody else, I blamed it on everybody\n\nLike corrupt politicians or the shitty economy, as long as it wasn't me\n\nOne day I lived in my head and looked into the mirror\n\nI was staring at me\n\n\n\nOpen your eyes and it'll make it easier to fight through the dark times, the dark times\n\nHold the light and it'll make it easier to shine through the dark times, the dark times\n\nIf the sky is always raining black, if the world is always stabbing you in the back\n\nOpen your eyes and you will find that we all live broken lives\n\n\n\nRemember we all go down in flames\n\nWe fell to live up to invincible mains\n\nWithout a heart and stuck in our minds\n\nWe can't forget how we all live broken lives",
