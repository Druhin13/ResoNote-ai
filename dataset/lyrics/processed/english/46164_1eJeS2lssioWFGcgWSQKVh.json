  "lyrics": "In the dark I live\r\nWithout any freedom in life\r\nThose darkened shadows do not deceive\r\nThey are all I see and know\r\nThis cave is all I breathe\r\nIn chains 'til the day that you die\n\nThis crimson fire burns at my back\n\nLike waves of nothing it flows\n\nOne can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark\n\nBut one cannot forgive a man who is afraid of the light\n\nGods. Blind. Death. Chains. Dark. Bravery.\n\nWar versus peace\n\nIgnorance versus strength\n\nFreedom versus slavery\n\nThe dreamer must awake\n\n\n\nلا إله إلا الله\n\nThere is no god except Allah\n\nLa illaha illallah\n\nWithin a dream, I cannot forsake\n\nAll hope has flown away\n\nThis dark shall be your friend\n\nYour wish is not my command\n\nFree thought will lead you astray\n\nThe brother looks from above\n\nI cannot forsake the brother I love\n\nOne can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark\n\nThe real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light\n\nThe stage is set for me\n\nYour life is a play that we wrote\n\nThe curtain has to rise now you shall see\n\nThis tragedy is the ending we sought\n\nThe shadows are dancing upon the wall\n\nThe man who has the gift of sight is one with truth in heart\n\nHe sees beyond the veil of life, our cave he will depart\n\nLike Icarus he will fly too high and for that he must die\n\nThose unsung prophets and dead messiahs will fall\n\nWe choose to live in this darkened cave, far, far away from the light",
