  "lyrics": "Now, the prodigal son was a forward child, his mind was not to obey\r\nBut after he left his father's house he thought he had gone astray\r\nI believe I believe that I will go back home\r\nI believe I believe that I will go back home\r\nI believe I believe I that I will go back home\n\nAnd be a servant of the Lord\n\n\n\nHis father saw him coming he met him with a smile\n\nHe threw his arms around him saying this is my darling child\n\n\n\nI believe I believe that I will go back home\n\nI believe I believe that I will go back home\n\nI believe I believe I that I will go back home\n\nAnd be a servant of the Lord\n\n\n\nThe prodigal said, I searched for true religion, but to peace and no faith could I find\n\nUntil I came to a little place called Bakersfield, that eased my troublin' mind\n\n\n\nI believe I believe that I will go back home\n\nI believe I believe that I will go back home\n\nI believe I believe I that I will go back home\n\nAnd be a servant of the Lord\n\n\n\nI wandered into a tavern where a music band was playin'\n\nThe steel guitar rang out so sweet, I feel like I was prayin'\n\nI asked a comely waitress, is this a new teaching\n\nShe said there is no God but God, and Ralph Mooney is his name\n\nLet me empty your ashtray, Mr. Mooney, if the drunks interfere I'll be sad\n\nBut just as long as you sit there on the bandstand and play your guitar like Buddha, I'll be glad\n\nThe father asked the prodigal, did you smell the sweet perfume and hear the angel band?\n\nHe said, dim lights, thick smoke, and loud, loud music is the only kind of truth I'll ever understand\n\nThe prodigal son",
