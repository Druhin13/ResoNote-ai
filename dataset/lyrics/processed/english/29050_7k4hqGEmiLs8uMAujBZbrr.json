  "lyrics": "I crawl into the river\r\nAnd fall down in a glassy maze\r\nA new sky hovers above me\r\nI can’t recognize anything\r\nI stand out, stand out\r\nAlone and almost erased\n\nI stand out, s-s-stand out\n\nI can’t recognize this place\n\n\n\nIn whose world am I?\n\n\n\nTrespassed in old clothes from a time I’m without\n\nSeven eyes on me now\n\nI am found out\n\n\n\nPulled even further\n\nNow I can never leave\n\nI can’t be bothered ‘bout my health\n\nWhen I got this coming at me\n\n\n\nCan’t you that they’re coming in\n\nAs they repackage your burial\n\nCan’t you feel that they’re coming in\n\nBathed in emerald shine\n\n\n\nI awake from a dream unconfined by sense of sight alone\n\nIn all in the haze eyes with hunger on me and\n\nI wonder if this what death feels like\n\nSuffocating out in the open air\n\nDrowning in an empty sea\n\nDrowning in the empty sea and never coming home again\n\n\n\nI ain’t listening what you got to say, man\n\nWhile all them bodies they hang from the ceiling\n\n\n\nThey hang from the ceiling\n\nThey light up the ceiling\n\n\n\nNow is that what you want from me if I start to misbehave?\n\nTo be part of immortal hues inside of this glassy cage\n\n\n\nJust gotta have it",
