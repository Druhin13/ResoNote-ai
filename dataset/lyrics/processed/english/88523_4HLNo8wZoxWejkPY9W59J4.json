  "lyrics": "Pop the cork on yesterday's wine, 'cause I don't feel like going out tonight\r\nLet's spend a couple of forty-fives and order some Chinese stake out\r\nDo the dishes and turn down the lights, watch more sad story for the eighteenth time\r\nI couldn't think of a better way to spend my Friday night\r\nNo, we could've charge a taxi cabs, c'mon baby what do you say\n\nI'll be your cheap date, put my little [?] just wait\n\nSo I'm really in the party downtown, I'm more about the right here right now\n\nThink about the loving will make\n\nThink of all the money we'll save\n\nWe don't have to go far, take me home\n\nI'll be your cheap date\n\n\n\nIf you care much for fancy champagne, unpronounceable fancy French names, I'll much rather just sit on the couch and make out\n\nMmm, it's been long hard week and I don't want nothing but you holding me\n\n\n\nI'll be your cheap date, putting my little [?] just wait\n\nSo I'm really in the party downtown, I'm more about the right here right now\n\nThink about the loving will make\n\nThink of all the money we'll save\n\nWe don't have to go far, take me home\n\nI'll be your cheap date\n\n\n\nCome a little closer baby\n\nLet me be your cheap date\n\nI'll be your cheap date, putting my little [?] just wait\n\n'Cause I'm really in the party downtown, no I'm more about the you and me right here and right now\n\nThink about the loving will make\n\nThink of all the money we'll save\n\nYou don't have to go far, take me home\n\nI'll be your cheap date",
