  "lyrics": "Feels so good to fall in love\r\nWhy do I feel so far from where I started from?\r\nAssisting him; the blood is thin\r\nSharing all the air I breathe; my secrets and my sins\r\nDistant walls in his eyes and needs\n\nWant to place you babe, tongue in teeth\n\nBeing good to you while losing me\n\nSomehow I think we're friends; somehow I think we're free\n\n\n\nBut what is love anyway?\n\nYou don't believe in it—you agree with me\n\nBut what is love anyway?\n\nYou don't believe in love—you agree with me\n\n\n\nBoiling plate to the Golden Gate\n\nNo drugs to blame—it was my fateful mistake\n\nYou reminded me who was actually worse\n\nSome clichéd \"Okay, let's not lose it in love.\"\n\n\n\nBut how do we stop what we started?\n\nWell now it just hurts 'til we parted\n\nBut how do we stop what we started?\n\nWell now it just hurts 'til we parted\n\nBut how do we stop what we started?\n\nWell now it just hurts 'til we parted\n\n\n\nBut what is love anyway?\n\nYou don't believe in it—you agree with me\n\nBut what is love anyway?\n\nYou don't believe in love—you agree with me\n\n\n\n\n\nIn your arms though, you warm me with a smile\n\nLeave me in the wood with the beauty for a while\n\nWhen I've got out I've got a hundred people to tell\n\nI want to be with you and blow it all to hell",
