  "lyrics": "Oh, hazel eyes\r\nWhile you're open\r\nTake care of my breath\r\nAll through the night\r\nWithout your delight\r\nLife is frozen\n\nPuts all men in fright\n\n\n\nIn the misty port\n\nI made a promise\n\nI will be home\n\nTill the boy will be born\n\nI wait in the cold\n\nSo I have to do\n\nEverything to be bold\n\n\n\nA louring gunfire is\n\nBreaking the silence\n\nAs night is fallin' down\n\nAnd we'll face death\n\nAll the night\n\n\n\nFar, far away\n\nWhere the Red paints the ocean\n\nWash away emotion\n\nWhile we fight through the night\n\nI say a Hail Mary\n\nLong to get home and my promise won't be broken so I must stay alive\n\n\n\nOh, the nasty war\n\nMakes a man cruel\n\nDo everything for pride and valour\n\nSo I grab my sword, dip into blood\n\nAs I only hear the roar\n\n\n\nA louring gunfire is\n\nBreaking the silence\n\nAs night is fallin' down\n\nAnd we'll face death\n\nAll the night\n\n\n\nFar, far away\n\nWhere the Red paints the ocean\n\nWash away emotion\n\nWhile we fight through the night\n\nI say a Hail Mary\n\nLong to get home and my promise won't be broken so I must stay alive\n\n\n\nA dire cannonball is breaking my dreams\n\nAs my body's fallin' down\n\nAnd I won't see Hazel eyes\n\n\n\nFar, far away\n\nWhere the Red paints the ocean\n\nWash away emotion\n\nWhile we fight through the night\n\nI say a Hail Mary\n\nLong to get home and\n\nMy promise won't be broken so I must stay alive\n\n\n\nFar, far away\n\nWhere the Red paints the ocean\n\nWash away emotion\n\nWhile we fight through the night\n\nI say a Hail Mary\n\nLong to get home and my promise won't be broken so I must stay alive",
