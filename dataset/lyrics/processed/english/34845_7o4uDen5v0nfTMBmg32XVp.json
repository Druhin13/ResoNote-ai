  "lyrics": "Gone, gone\r\nOn two legs but my feet never touched the ground\r\nI got my head in the soil, leave no prints to be found\r\nThe nature's strength, the wonder who I am (Gone)\r\nA weakening force, all echoes from my past\n\nGone, gone, gone, gone, gone\n\n\n\nAnd the battle goes on (Shala)\n\nAnd the love that you felt (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)\n\nAnd the songs that you sung (Shala)\n\nAnd the words that you meant (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)\n\n\n\nSh!\n\nWill be here when you are gone\n\n\n\nThis mouth on me and this voice against time (Gone)\n\nBe brave and free or be wing clipped and grimed (Gone)\n\nThis weakening noise will fade softly to silence (Gone)\n\n\n\nAnd the battle goes on (Shala)\n\nAnd the love that you felt (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)\n\nAnd the songs that you sung (Shala)\n\nAnd the words that you meant (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)\n\n\n\nAnd the battle goes on (Shala)\n\nAnd the love that you felt (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)\n\nAnd the songs that you sung (Shala)\n\nAnd the hurt that you felt (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, Shala)\n\n\n\nOne final moment as I stay awake\n\nAs the air I breathe will make a change of space (Gone)\n\nThey'll never know, they'll never feel the ache\n\nThe drips of salt you're tasting off my face\n\nThe nature's strength, the wonder who I am\n\nShala, Shala, Shala, Shala, Shala, Shala\n\n\n\nAnd the battle goes on (Shala)\n\nAnd the love that you felt (Shala, shala, shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, shala)\n\nAnd the songs that you sung (Shala)\n\nAnd the words that you meant (Shala, shala, shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, shala)\n\n\n\nAnd the battle goes on (Shala)\n\nAnd the love that you felt (Shala, shala, shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, shala)\n\nAnd the songs that you sung (Shala)\n\nAnd the hurt that you felt (Shala, Shala, Shala)\n\nWill be here when you are gone (Shala, shala)\n\n\n\nGone\n\nAnd the battle goes on\n\nAnd the love that you felt\n\nWill be here when you are gone\n\nAnd the songs that you sung\n\nAnd the words that you meant\n\nWill be here when you are gone",
