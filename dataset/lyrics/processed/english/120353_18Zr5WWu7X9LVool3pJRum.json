  "lyrics": "Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?\r\nIt's funny how they're all the same\r\nIt's funny how you always remember\r\nAnd we've both done it all a hundred times before\r\nIt's funny how I still forgot\n\nIt would be a hundred times easier\n\nIf we were young again\n\nBut as it is\n\nAnd it is\n\nWe're just two slow dancers, last ones out\n\nWe're two slow dancers, last ones out\n\n\n\nAnd the ground has been slowly pulling us back down\n\nYou see it on both our skin\n\nWe get a few years and then it wants us back\n\n\n\nIt would be a hundred times easier\n\nIf we were young again\n\nBut as it is\n\nAnd it is\n\nTo think that we could stay the same\n\nTo think that we could stay the same\n\nTo think that we could stay the same\n\nBut we're two slow dancers, last ones out\n\nWe're two slow dancers, last ones out\n\nTwo slow dancers, last ones out",
