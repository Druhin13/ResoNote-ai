  "lyrics": "Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh\r\nEven though you might get mad at me, oh, oh\r\nSometimes it's hard to face reality\r\nShould've been adjusted to my life\r\nHad the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time\n\nNow you're standin' right in front of me\n\nIt hurts me to know that I lied\n\nTryna protect your feelings\n\nYou been in between the lines\n\nHope your heart has started healing\n\n\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh\n\nEven though you might get mad at me, oh, oh\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality\n\n\n\nDon't be afraid to stand alone\n\nDon't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone\n\nI know it's hard away from home\n\nAnd it ain't easy all alone\n\nRelationships over the phone\n\nTalkin' to your significant other all night long\n\n\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh\n\nEven though you might get mad at me, oh, oh\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality\n\n\n\nLove and death are quite similar\n\nHow they come and go like cat burglars\n\nReality is kinda hard to face\n\nLike actual facts is to flat-earthers\n\nRain's a requirement for flowers to grow\n\nAnd pain's a requirement for power to grow\n\nIt's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago\n\nSuch is life though, it's just a cycle\n\nThe bigger picture and the smaller picture\n\nExactly same, it's macro, micro\n\nCrack yo' atom and let yo' light glow\n\nOne day, you could be the king of pop\n\nThen the next one just be wack ol' Michael\n\nIt's human nature, just like he told us\n\nLet's face reality, crack the cycle\n\n\n\nKnow it hurts to see the truth in your face\n\nCircumstances bring you down to your knees\n\nGo on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it\n\nEnough to put your heart at ease\n\nOh, don't lose your self esteem\n\nI apologise, for being a man\n\nIt's way harder than what it seems\n\n\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)\n\nEven though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality\n\nSometimes it's hard to face reality",
