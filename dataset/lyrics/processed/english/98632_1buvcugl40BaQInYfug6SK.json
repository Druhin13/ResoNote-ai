  "lyrics": "In my younger days\r\nI was flying free\r\nThat's before there was you and me\r\nI love 'em and I leave 'em\r\nAnd you changed everything\r\nOh, who the hell needs wings\n\n\n\nI don't need a reason to chase freedom\n\nI found something I believe in\n\nSeeing what I'm seeing\n\nIs like what I've never seen\n\nWho the hell needs wings\n\n\n\nI'm so sick of sleeping\n\nIn the same old bed\n\nJust tossin' turnin' in the sheets\n\nI know it's not a palace\n\nBut I've got some bread\n\nJust enough to afford a queen\n\n\n\nI don't need a reason to chase freedom\n\nI found something I believe in\n\nSeeing what I'm seeing\n\nIs like what I've never seen\n\nWho the hell needs wings\n\n\n\nI don't need a reason to chase freedom\n\nI found something I can believe in\n\nSeeing what I'm seeing\n\nIs like what I've never seen\n\nWho the hell needs wings\n\n\n\nWho the hell needs wings\n\nIn my younger days\n\nI was flying free\n\nOh, who the hell needs wings",
