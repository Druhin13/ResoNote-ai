  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson What is the time par Dirty Projectors\r\nLeave the spoon-fed champions\nLeave the lamp lit prose\nLeave the endlessly distracting matin√©es\nAnd say hello\nHello\nHello\n\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\nI don't know why it's been so long\nAlone, imagining nobody\nOnce in a while, well\nI guess the planets align\nAnd show me the one I am\nI am the one who would love you\nSeek the dusty loan shark\n\n\nOn the last frontier\nJoin the modern miracle that looks flat\nBut reveals itself a sphere\nAs the wheel of inception steered years\n\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\nI don't know why it's been so long\nAlone, imagining nobody\nOnce in a while, well\nI guess the planets align\nAnd show me the one I am\nI am the one who would love you\n\nThey say it's ashes to ashes\nPassion is passing\nAnd we all will die alone [?]\n\nBut while we're here on the planet\nDancing on prairie\nWhy do we drink all to [?] and [?]?\n\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\nI don't know why it's been so long\nAlone, imagining nobody\nOnce in a while, well\nI guess the planets align\nAnd show me the one I am\nI am the one who would love you\n\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\nI don't know why it's been so long\nAlone, imagining nobody\nOnce in a while, well\n\nI guess the planets align\nAnd show me the one I am\nI am the one who would love you",
