  "lyrics": "Father forgive me for I've been a sinner,\r\nThought I was done. But I'm still a beginner,\r\nIt's a game and I'm not the winner.\r\nUsed to be blessed it was wide I was open,\r\nHow does it feel to be heard and outspoken.\n\nIt's all day but still just a moment.\n\n\n\nIs there anyone who knows and anyone who would say,\n\nIs there anyone who wants to feel or wants to be this way.\n\n\n\nI'm just a little broke down, just a little broke up\n\nAt the fact that I can't even\n\nEver explain everything if I made this right.\n\nI'm just a little tore up and a little tore down,\n\nIt's a fact that I won't even\n\nHave to wait anything to make this right.\n\n\n\nSaid that it was only a matter before\n\nI know your way, I know you need more.\n\nSo we can try and we kiss it goodbye let it go.\n\n\n\nIf there's anyone who knows and anyone who would care.\n\nIf anyone who can help me try to get me back to there.\n\n\n\nI'm just a little broke down, just a little broke up\n\nAt the fact that I can't even\n\nEver explain everything if I made this right.\n\nI'm just a little tore up and a little tore down,\n\nIt's a fact that I won't even\n\nHave to wait anything to make this right.\n\n\n\nWhat have I become? What have I done? Why is this every day?\n\nI wish I cared like I used to care every single day.\n\n\n\nI'm just a little broke down, just a little broke up\n\nAt the fact that I can't even\n\nEver explain everything if I made this right.\n\nI'm just a little tore up and a little tore down,\n\nIt's a fact that I won't even\n\nHave to wait anything to make this right.",
