  "lyrics": "Every time I couldn't choke back the tears\r\nEvery time I couldn't fight off my fears \nYou were paving the path that brought me\r\nPaving the path that brought me here \nEvery time my courage just disappeared\n\nAnd I felt my future was so unclear \n\nYou were paving the path that brought me\n\nPaving the path that brought me here\n\n\n\nI walked a winding road that led me back to You\n\nI took a twisted path that led me straight to You\n\nAnd when I look behind \n\nI see Your grace in every crooked line\n\n\n\nEven when I ran to places I thought\n\nThat Your mercy simply would never go\n\nYou were paving the path that brought me\n\nPaving the path that brought me home\n\n\n\nEven when I traded your love for my pride\n\nTo protect the hurt I carried inside\n\nYou were paving the path that saved me\n\nPaving the path that saved my life\n\n\n\nI walked a winding road that led me back to You\n\nI took a twisted path that led me straight to You\n\nAnd when I look behind \n\nI see Your grace in every crooked line\n\n\n\nOh, oh\n\nYou're lifting me up\n\nWhen my hope is gone\n\nYou're lifting me up\n\nTo set my feet on the ground\n\nSalvation is the song You're singing over me now\n\nI know I don't deserve it\n\nI know I couldn't earn it still\n\n\n\nI walked a winding road that led me back to You\n\nI took a twisted path that led me straight to You\n\nAnd when I look behind \n\nI see Your grace\n\n\n\nI walked a winding road that led me back to You\n\nI took a twisted path that led me straight to You\n\nAnd when I look behind \n\nI see Your grace \n\nWhen I look behind \n\nI see Your grace in every crooked line\n\n\n\nOh every crooked line\n\nWhen I look behind \n\nI see Your grace in every crooked line",
