  "lyrics": "A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun\r\nYou can't trust anyone\r\nI was so sure what I needed was more\r\nTried to shoot out the sun\r\nDays when we raged, we flew off the page\r\nSuch damage was done\n\nBut I made it through, 'cause somebody knew\n\nI was meant for someone\n\n\n\nSo girl, leave your boots by the bed\n\nWe ain't leaving this room\n\nTill someone needs medical help\n\nOr the magnolias bloom\n\nIt's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood\n\nSo cover me up and know you're enough\n\nTo use me for good\n\n\n\nPut your faith to the test when I tore off your dress\n\nIn Richmond on high\n\nBut I sobered up and I swore off that stuff\n\nForever this time\n\nAnd the old lover's sing\n\n“I thought it'd be me who helped him get home”\n\nBut home was a dream\n\nOne I'd never seen till you came along\n\n\n\nSo girl, hang your dress up to dry\n\nWe ain't leaving this room\n\nTill Percy Priest breaks open wide\n\nAnd the river runs through\n\nAnd carries this house on the Stones\n\nLike a piece of driftwood\n\nCover me up and know you're enough\n\nTo use me for good\n\n\n\nSo girl, leave your boots by the bed\n\nWe ain't leaving this room\n\nTill someone needs medical help\n\nOr the magnolias bloom\n\nIt's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood\n\nSo cover me up and know you're enough\n\nTo use me for good\n\nCover me up and know you're enough\n\nTo use me for good",
