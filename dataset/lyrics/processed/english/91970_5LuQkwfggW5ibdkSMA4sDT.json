  "lyrics": "I never had shit, so I wear my AP when I sleep\r\nI respect my OGs 'cause they practice what they preach\r\nMy whip customized, fully loaded, quilted seats\r\nBuy her CC sneaks just so I don't hear a peep\r\nI mean I got a maid that change my sheets\r\nI'm so lit that my first crush just turned into a creep\n\nPush-to-start, I think I lost my key under the seat\n\nMakin' art with my home team and my whole team gon' eat\n\n\n\nTension I feel when I go on the road\n\nGot hittas that'll snip you down and grippin' on their pole\n\nTension I feel, my pinky covered in diamond rose\n\nNo pension, I'm finna go and buy my mom a Rolls\n\nTension I feel when I come offstage at my show\n\nTension I feel when I see someone that I know\n\nAttention I feel when I wear Prada to my toes\n\nAttention I feel when I'm surrounded by these hoes\n\n\n\nTension I feel when the plug don't pick up\n\nTension I feel when the sun comin' up\n\nWe be in the field, it ain't hard to find us\n\nI'm chillin' at the top, you still tryna climb up\n\nI feel tension every time I count up\n\nJust to mention I'm grateful that they found us\n\nThey feel tension when they come around us\n\nAll this water, think the jeweler tryna drown us\n\nTake half of the E, let her wear my rings\n\nAll my stones are fancy, be careful with these\n\nTension I feel when she don't give 'em back to me\n\nTension I feel when she don't suck me 'til I sleep\n\n\n\nTension I feel when I go on the road\n\nGot hittas that'll snip you down and grippin' on their pole\n\nTension I feel, my pinky covered in diamond rose\n\nNo pension, I'm finna go and buy my mom a Rolls\n\nTension I feel when I come offstage at my show\n\nTension I feel when I see someone that I know\n\nAttention I feel when I wear Prada to my toes\n\nAttention I feel when I'm surrounded by these hoes\n\n\n\nThey wasn't used to somebody that looks like me\n\n(I feel tension)\n\nNow you look at god\n\n(Tension I feel, tension I feel)\n\nSeeing the things I've seen, know what I'm sayin'?\n\n(Tension I feel, tension I feel, I feel tension)\n\nThe music just come through, no matter what\n\n(Tension I feel)\n\nThey ain't care what I looked like, they just care about the music",
