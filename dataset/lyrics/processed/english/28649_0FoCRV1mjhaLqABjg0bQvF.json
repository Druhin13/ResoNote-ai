  "lyrics": "Digging with my hands till they bleed on the open road\r\nA path to self destruction\r\nJust a passionate degenerate with shattered glass for eyes\r\nEasy to forget the mistakes I made\r\nA weakness of mind that the nectar revives\n\nGiving me the confidence\n\nBring me to life, to smite my kind\n\nA belligerent fool with a death wish\n\nRunning with the chance of a moment past\n\nForget the sentence, hang me now\n\n\n\nNo one can save us, we’ll find a way\n\nTurn the page, let me hear you say\n\n\n\nRepent, It’s a revolution\n\nBelieve in me\n\nThe world I’ve seen is filled with greed\n\nThey say there’s nothing in the after life\n\nRepent, It’s a revolution\n\nTo set me free\n\nThe world I’ve seen is not for me\n\nNo, there is glory in the after life\n\n\n\nNo fucking sympathy\n\nThe promise of a new beginning surrounded me\n\nI threw my body in the river\n\nThen the sinner within me watched it drown\n\n\n\nThis time I’ve crossed the line\n\nSelf destructive, in decline\n\nMy words were not my vow\n\nI need actions, I need them now\n\n\n\nIn hell all saints will sin\n\nPatience is wearing thin\n\nEach day we live in doubt\n\nWe need actions, we need them now\n\n\n\nThis time I’ve crossed the line\n\nSelf destructive, in decline\n\nMy words were not my vow\n\nWe need actions, we need them now",
