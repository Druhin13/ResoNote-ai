  "lyrics": "It turned to shit\r\nOn April 18th\r\nAt home on the stairs\r\nWith an old cup of tea and your head\r\nHeld heavy in your hands\n\nAll the trouble with your sleeping\n\nFrom a hole I could hear your breathing\n\nRestless under blinding lights\n\n\n\nA fool, I fenced our love into a rock\n\nAnd I have no defense\n\nFor how we go a-bed\n\nI should have begged for you to stay\n\n\n\nJoan I've loved you since I\n\nWas seventeen\n\nAnd I am lost without you\n\nAt first I didn't feel it\n\nBut now I'm disappearing\n\n\n\nI'll sit here for days\n\nIn my every different hate\n\nGiven the year\n\nIt's unlikely I'll ever change\n\n\n\nBut you were right\n\nI fenced our love into a rock\n\nAnd I have no defense\n\nFor how we go a-bed\n\n\n\nI should have begged for you to stay\n\n\n\nJoan I've loved you since I\n\nWas seventeen\n\nAnd I am lost without you\n\nAt first I didn't feel it\n\nBut now I'm disappearing\n\n\n\nI'm disappearing\n\nI'm disappearing\n\nI'm disappearing",
