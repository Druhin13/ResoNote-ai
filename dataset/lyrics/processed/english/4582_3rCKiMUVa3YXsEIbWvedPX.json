  "lyrics": "Beyond the pines are the breeze I shoot\r\nThere's a place where I undo\r\nAnd it happens all the time\r\nI'm immune to goodbyes, oh\r\nSwiss watch and a baseball cap\r\nWon't go far with a face like that\r\nStill they keep me wanting more\r\nA church with a locked door\r\n♪\r\nYou keep me wanting more\r\n♪\r\nEverything gets blurry, am I right where you want me?\r\nMelting like an ice cream in the sun\r\nHe's low and she's high, but I take it offline\r\nIs there really such a thing as too much fun?\r\nAn ice cream in the sun\r\n♪\r\nArt imitates life again\r\nRose and I used to be friends\r\nWe'd hand out from time to time\r\nWhen we could toe the line, oh\r\nWhat I lack in humility\r\nMy ego pays back to me\r\nAnd it keeps me wanting more\r\nA church with a locked door\r\n♪\r\nYou keep me wanting more\r\nEverything gets blurry, am I right where you want me?\r\nMelting like an ice cream in the sun\r\nHe's low and she's high, but I take it offline\r\nIs there really such a thing as too much fun?\r\nAn ice cream in the sun\r\n♪\r\nEverything gets blurry, am I right where you want me?\r\nMelting like an ice cream in the sun\r\nHe's low and she's high, but I'm taking it offline\r\nIs there really such a thing as too much fun?\r\nAn ice cream in the sun",
