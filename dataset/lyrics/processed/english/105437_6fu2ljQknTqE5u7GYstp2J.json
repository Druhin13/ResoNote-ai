  "lyrics": "Well I'm a thousand miles away\r\nAnd it feels like a thousand days\r\nSince I seen that smile, heard that laugh\r\nFelt that touch I've been needing so bad\r\nAnd the only way to get there fast\n\nI'm going home in my mind\n\nCruising by them Carolina pines\n\nTaking it slow, doing 35 down Timber drive\n\nI can already feel your hand in mine\n\nSweet tea, porch swings, supper on the stove\n\nEverything I've been missing on the road\n\nI can't be there tonight\n\nBut when I close my eyes\n\nI'm going home in my mind\n\nI'm going home in my mind\n\n\n\nWhen I'm fighting off the lonely\n\nJust needing you to hold me\n\nHung up in a hotel\n\nThere ain't no telling girl where I'm at\n\nBut baby I'm coming back\n\nYeah I'm coming back\n\n\n\nI'm going home in my mind\n\nCruising by them Carolina pines\n\nTaking it slow, doing 35 down Timber drive\n\nI can already feel your hand in mine\n\nSweet tea, porch swings, supper on the stove\n\nEverything I've been missing on the road\n\nI can't be there tonight\n\nBut when I close my eyes\n\nI'm going home in my mind, yeah\n\nI'm going home in my mind, yeah\n\n\n\nWish I could hop on the next flight\n\nAnd have you by my side\n\nBut this'll have to do tonight\n\n\n\nI'm going home in my mind\n\nCruising by them Carolina pines\n\nTaking it slow, doing 35 down Timber drive\n\nI can already feel your hand in mine\n\nSweet tea in a porch swings, supper on the stove\n\nEverything I've been missing on the road\n\nI can't be there tonight\n\nBut if I close my eyes\n\nI'm going home in my mind\n\nYeah I'm going home in my mind",
