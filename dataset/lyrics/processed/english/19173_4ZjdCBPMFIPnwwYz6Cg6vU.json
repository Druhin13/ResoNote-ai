  "lyrics": "The sun's coming out to meet us\r\nWe were fighting the coming night, the coming night\r\nGone were the codes between us\r\nAnd our bodies were holding tight, squeezing life\r\nHey love, whoever got you got gold\n\nHey love, whoever got you got gold\n\n\n\nStronger than the ground beneath us\n\nThe days blended and flew away, all the things to say\n\nThe world could never beat us\n\nWith its worries and its nothing days, we ran away\n\n\n\nHey love, whoever got you got gold\n\nHey love, whoever got you got gold\n\n\n\nFound it in nights\n\nFaded in blue\n\nWhat have I become to you?\n\nRemember the names\n\nI know I do\n\nDo you?\n\nDo you?\n\n\n\nThe sun came out to greet us\n\nWe were fighting the coming night, the coming night\n\n\n\nHey love, whoever got you got gold\n\nHey love, whoever got you got gold",
