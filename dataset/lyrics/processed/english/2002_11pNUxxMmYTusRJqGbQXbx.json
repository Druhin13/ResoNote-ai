  "lyrics": "Night time is sweet when I’m by your side\r\nDrifting asleep as the train blows by\r\nWondering how in the hell I’d survive\r\nWithout you loving me every day of my life\r\nEvery little thing you do\n\nIs still driving me so wild I can’t think what’s left do\n\nI keep falling in love with you\n\nI keep falling in love with you\n\n\n\nTake me away to a place so far\n\nRiding on a train or we can take my car\n\nBaby you know that I’m along for the ride\n\nAs long as I’m riding with you by my side\n\n\n\nBaby don’t you know it’s true\n\nI could try to think of a million things but all I wanna do\n\nIs keep falling in love with you\n\nI keep falling in love with you\n\n\n\nBaby believe me, I’ve been feeling so high and I never wanna come down\n\nLike I’m in heaven when I’m looking out a window feeling like I’m fast asleep\n\nMaybe I’m dreaming, but it feels so real and I never wanna find out\n\n(Keep falling in, keep ,keep, falling in)\n\n(Keep falling in, keep ,keep, falling in)\n\n\n\nEvery little thing you do is still driving me so wild\n\nI can’t think what’s left do\n\nI keep falling in love with you\n\nI keep falling in love with you\n\nI keep falling in love with you\n\nI keep falling in love with you",
