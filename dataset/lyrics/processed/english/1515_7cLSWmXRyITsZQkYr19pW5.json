  "lyrics": "What’s inside of the beast\r\nTell me now what you need\r\nTo start your own execution\r\nIf I’m battered and torn\r\nStrip it down to the core\r\nTry to fight the redemption\n\n\n\nWe scream every single word\n\nBegging for some retribution\n\nYou only feed on the weak\n\nIf it was all meant to be\n\nIs that the only condition?\n\n\n\nI pray it turns around\n\n\n\nSomething to believe\n\nThat pulls us to our knees\n\n\n\nWhen all is lost, we find our will to let it go\n\nIf it’s comfort that you need\n\nTry and just believe you’re unforgiven\n\nJust admit it\n\n\n\nFrom the day that you’re born\n\nAll you hear is the scorn\n\nFrom your own institution\n\nWipe the dirt off your teeth\n\nAnd try and say what you mean\n\nTo start your own revolution\n\n\n\nWe scream never to be heard\n\nCutting off the one solution\n\nYou only bring the disease\n\nAnd strip away what you need\n\nAnd hope that god will forgive us\n\n\n\nI pray he comes around\n\n\n\nSomething to believe\n\nThat pulls us to our knees\n\nWhen all is lost, we find the will to live and let it go\n\nIf it’s comfort that you need\n\nTry and just believe you’re unforgiven\n\n\n\nJust admit it\n\n\n\nSacrilegious\n\nDo you believe?\n\nWatch the pieces fall\n\n\n\nHold us down\n\nNo one wins holy wars\n\nJust tell me now I need to know\n\n\n\nSo please pull us to our knees\n\nWhen all is lost, we find the will to live and let it go\n\n\n\nIf it’s comfort that you need\n\nTry and just believe\n\n\n\nWhy? Just admit it\n\n\n\nIf it’s comfort that you need\n\nTry and just believe you’re\n\n\n\nI pray it turns around",
