  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Losing My Religion par R.E.M\r\nOh life, it's bigger\nIt's bigger than you\nAnd you are not me\nThe lengths that I will go to\nThe distance in your eyes\nOh no, I've said too much\nI set it up\n\nThat's me in the corner\nThat's me in the spotlight\nLosing my religion\nTrying to keep up with you\nAnd I don't know if I can do it\nOh no, I've said too much\nI haven't said enough\n\n\nI thought that I heard you laughing\nI thought that I heard you sing\nI think I thought I saw you try\n\nEvery whisper\nOf every waking hour\nI'm choosing my confessions\nTrying to keep an eye on you\nLike a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool\nOh no, I've said too much\nI set it up\n\nConsider this\nConsider this, the hint of the century\nConsider this, the slip\nThat brought me to my knees, failed\nWhat if all these fantasies come\nFlailing around\n\nNow I've said too much\n\nI thought that I heard you laughing\nI thought that I heard you sing\nI think I thought I saw you try\n\nBut that was just a dream\nThat was just a dream\n\nThat's me in the corner\nThat's me in the spotlight\nLosing my religion\nTrying to keep up with you\nAnd I don't know if I can do it\nOh no, I've said too much\nI haven't said enough\n\nI thought that I heard you laughing\n\nI thought that I heard you sing\nI think I thought I saw you try\n\nBut that was just a dream\nTry, cry, why try\nThat was just a dream\nJust a dream\nJust a dream, dream",
