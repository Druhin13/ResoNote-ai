  "lyrics": "Can a man be so blind that this vision can't be mine?\r\n'Cause the shore won't draw the line when water rising with the tide\r\nAnd for once, I am drifting, but not on my own\r\nAnd now I'm right where I shoulda been, here with you all along\r\nI've been me, and the lead\n\nAll those nights, I was weak\n\nI gave up while you held it down\n\nYou're still here, but I know\n\nThat your heart's getting cold\n\nI'm holding tight, it's getting real now\n\n\n\n'Cause I can't lose\n\n'Cause I care for you\n\nI can't lose you\n\nI care you for you\n\nI care you for you\n\nI care you for you\n\n\n\nSo it turns out, I don't ask for help\n\nAnd you don't wanna open up\n\nAnd when you see my tears right now\n\nYou want me to clean 'em up\n\nAll these hateful words, using them to stab me\n\nEven though it hurts, you can throw them at me, baby\n\nIt takes a man to admit he messed up\n\nBut girl, you gotta be fair\n\n\n\n'Cause I can't lose\n\n'Cause I care for you\n\nI can't lose you\n\nI care you for you\n\nI care you for you\n\nI care you for you, yeah\n\n\n\n(I care you for you)\n\nI've been me, and the lead\n\nAll those nights, I was weak\n\nI gave up while you held it down\n\n(I care you for you)\n\nYou're still here, but I know\n\nThat your heart's getting cold\n\nI'm holding tight, it's getting real now\n\n(I care you for you)\n\nAll these hateful words, using them to stab me\n\nEven though it hurts\n\n(I care you for you)\n\nYou can throw them at me, baby\n\n'Cause I can't lose you, baby\n\n\n\nI can't lose you\n\n'Cause I care for you\n\nI can't lose you\n\nI care you for you\n\nI care you for you\n\nI care you for you, yeah",
