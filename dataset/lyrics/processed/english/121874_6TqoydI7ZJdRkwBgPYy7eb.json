  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Little Poor Me par Layto\r\nI tried hard, you know I care\nI care, I care\nJust a little poor me\nJust a little poor me\n\nMirror, mirror on the wall\nI'll make sure you crack and fall\nI made strides don't call me sweet\nChaos organizes me\n\nI can see you're wondering oh why\n(Oh it's such distate)\nWhen I'm with you I crumble alive\n(I have to leave this place)\n\nI'm gone (hey)\n\nNot going home\nGoing down that lonely road\nWhoa-oh-oh-ooooh\nIt's too bad I'll never be back (oh-oh)\nI can't tell you what I feel inside\n(What I feel inside)\nThis feeling burns inside my mind\nJust a little poor me\n\nI tried hard, you know I care\nThousand years embrace that stare\nManic days I know you know\nYou'd get high while I'd be low\n\nI can sense you're trembling inside\n(Oh, that spiteful face)\nCertain things you just can never buy\n(Things you'll always chase)\n\n\nI'm gone (hey)\nNot going home\nGoing down that lonely road\nWhoa-oh-oh-ooooh\nIt's too bad I'll never be back (oh-oh)\nI can't tell you what I feel inside\n(What I feel inside)\nThis feeling burns inside my mind\nJust a little poor me\n\nThis is not what I want\nBecoming to someone I'm not\nDisaster, pressure it mounts\nFaster master please\nJust let me move on\nJust let me move on\nCome on\n\nIt's not like I'm wrong\nShedding a tear with the pain\nA month or a day\nThe game I can't play\nTypical time to move on\nYou know I'm not wrong (hey)\nAll for not\nThe me that you thought\nThe one who you sought\nI'm not the kind of kid\nTo point to a map\nWho runs at a snap\nI'm trapped, I'm trapped\nYes sir. No sir\nNot for me\nI'd rather spend it all\nSo you can see\nWhat freedom's really worth to me\n\nOne, two, three\nSet me free\n\nI'm gone (hey)\nNot going home\nGoing down that lonely road\nWhoa-oh-oh-ooooh\nIt's too bad I'll never be back (oh-oh)\nI can't tell you what I feel inside\n(What I feel inside)\nThis feeling burns inside my mind\nJust a little poor me\n\nI tried hard, you know I care\nI care, I care\nJust a little poor me\nJust a little poor me",
