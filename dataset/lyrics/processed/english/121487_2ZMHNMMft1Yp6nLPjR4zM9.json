  "lyrics": "Give me your misery, all of it give it to me\r\nI can hold onto it for you, it’s not a problem\r\nI just want your energy, a piece of that fractured mountain\r\nI’ll take whatever comes with it as long as it’s yours\r\nAnd all I know is that I want it more than yesterday\n\nIf I was waiting, I was waiting for just one little spark\n\nYou are the brightest I’ve seen\n\nYou are the best side of me\n\nAnd just for when we’re apart\n\nI’ve got a piece of your heart\n\n\n\nBut I want the whole damn thing\n\n\n\nI feel it inside of me, I feel it inside of you too\n\nSeeing forever this downcast blade from the sky\n\nCould never sever through, not what we have me and you\n\nBurning together and burning forever\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t know, I just can feel it in the atmosphere\n\nIf I’m wandering, I’ve wandered into just the right spot\n\nYou are the fire in my sleep\n\nYou are the reason I dream\n\nAnd just for when we’re apart\n\nI’ve got a piece of your heart\n\n\n\nI’ve got a piece of your heart\n\nBut I want the whole damn thing\n\n\n\nSay hello to all my problems for me\n\nTell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore\n\nThe years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die\n\nBut we’ll get by\n\nAnd it goes on forever just like this\n\nIf I could go back, I would do it all over with you again\n\n\n\nI’ve got a piece of your heart\n\nBut I want the whole damn thing\n\n\n\nSay hello to all my problems for me\n\nTell them sorry, I can’t be around anymore\n\nThe years will go on, we’ll get older and then we’ll die\n\nBut we’ll get by",
