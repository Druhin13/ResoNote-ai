  "lyrics": "Raven hair and ruby lips \nsparks fly from her finger tips \nEchoed voices in the night \nshe's a restless spirit on an endless flight \nwooo hooo witchy woman, see how \nhigh she flies \n\nwoo hoo witchy woman she got \n\nthe moon in her eye \n\nShe held me spellbound in the night \n\ndancing shadows and firelight \n\ncrazy laughter in another \n\nroom and she drove herself to madness \n\nwith a silver spoon \n\nwoo hoo witchy woman see how high she flies \n\nwoo hoo witchy woman she got the moon in her eye \n\nWell I know you want a lover, \n\nlet me tell your brother, she's been sleeping \n\nin the Devil's bed. \n\nAnd there's some rumors going round \n\nsomeone's underground \n\nshe can rock you in the nighttime \n\n'til your skin turns red \n\nwoo hoo witchy woman \n\nsee how high she flies \n\nwoo hoo witchy woman \n\nshe got the moon in her eye",
