  "lyrics": "If I could give this all back\r\nI would be home in the morning\r\nI'd wake up in a cold sweat\r\nTake a flight back to the city I was born in\r\nAnd I would wipe myself clean\r\nOf what I knew was unimportant\n\nI'd want typical things\n\nI'd try to fit back into all my old clothing\n\n\n\nAnd I would prove myself wrong\n\nThat all along, the problem was me\n\nWith all my bitterness gone\n\nHappy, I'd be\n\n\n\nI'll move back home forever\n\nI'll feed the dogs\n\nAnd I'll put all my pieces back together\n\nWhere they belong, and I'll say\n\n\"I'm a mess, I'm a mess\n\nOh God, I'm a mess\"\n\n\n\nAnd I'll take 89 to Boston\n\nSee my love\n\nAnd I'll help her set up her new apartment\n\nAnd we'll get drunk and she'll say\n\n\"Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess\n\nGood God, you're a mess\n\nOh, you're a mess, you're a mess\n\nGood God\"\n\n\n\nSo I paid off my debts but I found the world boring\n\nSo I called my old friends but they only ever ask me how tour is\n\nAnd there's still weight on my back, I just try to ignore it\n\nI guess the stage was my mask\n\nI forgot the way I looked before I wore it\n\n\n\nAnd I would prove myself wrong\n\nThat all along, the problem was me\n\nWith all my bitterness gone\n\nHappy, I'll be\n\n\n\nI'll move back home forever\n\nI'll feed the dogs\n\nAnd I'll put all my pieces back together where they belong\n\nAnd I'll say, \"I'm a mess, I'm a mess\n\nOh god, I'm a mess\"\n\n\n\nAnd I'll take 89 to Boston\n\nSee my love\n\nAnd I'll help her set up her new apartment\n\nAnd we'll get drunk and she'll say\n\n\"Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess\n\nGood God, you're a mess\n\nOh, you're a mess, you're a mess\"\n\n\n\nThat's not what I had hoped\n\nNow I find comfort in the cold\n\n\n\nI'll move back home forever\n\nI'll feed the dogs\n\nAnd I'll put all my pieces back together where they belong\n\nAnd I'll say, \"I'm a mess, I'm a mess\n\nOh God, I'm a mess\"\n\n\n\nAnd I'll take 89 to Boston\n\nSee my love and I'll help her\n\nSet up her new apartment\n\nAnd we'll get drunk and she'll say\n\n\"Shit, you're a mess, you're a mess\n\nGood God, you're a mess\n\nOh, you're a mess, you're a mess\n\nGood God\"",
