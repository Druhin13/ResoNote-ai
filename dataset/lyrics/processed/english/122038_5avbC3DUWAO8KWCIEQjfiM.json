Where you run from the police at?\n\nWhere you ever represented hope where the hopeless at?\n\nWhere you had to take an oath fore you sold a sack?\n\nDealt with all the pressure played it like you never noticed that\n\nAmongst it all, put yourself on the map\n\nTurned into a booming operation\n\nWhere your focus at?\n\nWhere your 600 Benz, where your Rovers at?\n\nWhere your Cuban link?\n\nNigga, where your Rollie at?\n\n\n\nI would rather shoot before I run\n\nPressure on my shoulder weigh a ton\n\nYou should try to do what we done\n\nMake a million dollars while you young\n\nI would rather shoot before I run\n\nPressure on my shoulder weigh a ton\n\nYou should try to do what we done\n\nMake a million dollars while you young\n\n\n\nSo if you can tell us how exactly and what deal you did to make a million dollars\n\n\n\nI can tell you niggas how I came up\n\nSimilar to climbing out the grave, huh\n\nCan't be actin' like a bitch tryna get saved bruh\n\nGet that dirt up off your shoulder step yo game up\n\nCan't be chasing pussy switch your ways up\n\nCan't be fuckin' off your lucci gotta save up\n\nSee you gon' probably fail tryna play us\n\nStreets ain't for everybody, get your grades up\n\nAin't bout your money you just lookin' for a stage huh\n\nAnd all that stuntin' put a bullet in your brain, huh?\n\nStupid ass nigga you can't fade us\n\nNiggas like pfft who even raised cuz\n\nWhere you come from?\n\nWhere you get your name from?\n\nYou was in the house, now with the runaway slaves, huh?\n\nYou ain't never in the spot when they raid huh?\n\nYou ain't really bout it lil nigga this a phase huh?\n\n\n\nI would rather shoot before I run\n\nPressure on my shoulder weigh a ton\n\nYou should try to do what we done\n\nMake a million dollars while you young\n\nI would rather shoot before I run\n\nPressure on my shoulder weigh a ton\n\nYou should try to do what we done\n\nMake a million dollars while you young",
