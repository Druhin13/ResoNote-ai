Clippers\n\nThem niggas met on the internet\nHow close could they really be?\nCatch us real life posted up and I ain't just takin' pics for IG\nAnd I ain't taggin' my nigga, k?\nThis shit here ain't no show and tell\n'Cause as soon as hoes see us doin' well\nThen everybody gonna have a story to tell\n\n[Jacquees]\nStarted from a DM, now she wanna see him\nIf you wanna link, baby, gotta be the weekend\nJust follow me, just follow me\nTell me how you feeling, followed by a million\nOoh, we goin' live, we ain't worries 'bout the comments\nJust follow me, just follow me",
