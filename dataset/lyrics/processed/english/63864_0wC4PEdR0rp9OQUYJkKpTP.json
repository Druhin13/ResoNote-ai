  "lyrics": "I was built into the form of a man\r\nBy nothing if you believe that\r\nThat I'm not looking for nothing in nobody's eyes is a lie\r\nLong to be seen in my silence\r\nAfter the years of shyness\r\nThat I'm not looking for nothing in nobody's eyes is a lie\n\n\n\nYou keep your wants registered with committees in your mind\n\nEach empty breath a record of what isn't there\n\nWill I be counted out among those from you taken\n\nSlowly your scalp spits a cowlick for me\n\nOver years spread out as adult resistant feeling\n\nAs something you forgot, that might've never been\n\n\n\nIn the hole on the Alcatraz tour\n\nYou were scared to touch the walls\n\nYou were scared to touch the floor\n\nOh I want to touch your pulse\n\nI want to touch your core\n\nAnd I hide in your pores like a puss\n\nNo, I want more\n\n\n\nPhone number like a misdealt hand in euchre\n\nYou're all the way more beautiful than a photograph of you\n\nDon't dig out that mote again\n\nWell I still need something\n\nAnd it might be you\n\n\n\nDon't dig out that mote again\n\nDon't dig out\n\nDon't dig out that mote again\n\nDon't dig out\n\nDon't dig out that mote again\n\n\n\nYou can take this lonesome token\n\nAnd toss it in the ocean\n\nBut hear me now weary in my tongue\n\nHold it in your hand\n\nHide it from the wind\n\nSleep with it like a secret\n\nAnd its wages will root deep beneath it",
