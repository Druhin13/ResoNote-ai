  "lyrics": "Put a thousand miles on these shoes\r\nWas I born to win or born to lose\r\nWhen the sky fades to black\r\nPedal down and don't look back\r\nPedal down and don't look back\n\nTrade in my burdens for lessons I'm learning\n\nAs this world just keeps turning round\n\nWake of the morning and fight off the shadows\n\nThat followed me here until now\n\nMy turn has come to turn and face the sun\n\n\n\nWho am I without my past\n\nWho am I without my mask\n\nIf you open up you'll turn around\n\nYou'll find yourself on solid ground\n\nYou'll find yourself on solid ground\n\n\n\nTrade in my burdens for lessons I'm learning\n\nAs this world just keeps turning round\n\nWake of the morning and fight off the shadows\n\nThat followed me here until now\n\nMy turn has come to turn and face the sun\n\n\n\nTrade in my burdens for lessons I'm learning\n\nAs this world just keeps turning round\n\nWake of the morning and fight off the shadows\n\nThat followed me here until now\n\nThe night is gone, my turn has come\n\nTo turn and face the sun",
