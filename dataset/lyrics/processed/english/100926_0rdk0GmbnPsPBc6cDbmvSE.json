  "lyrics": "Been sleeping over for the past couple of weeks\r\nMaking a habit out of it, yeah\r\nWhen I woke up, I saw your toothbrush on the sink\r\nIt kinda scared me, I'll admit\r\nIf there's a line, then I think that we crossed it\n\nSecond time you stay the night\n\nIf there's a cool, then I think that I lost it\n\nAnd I should take my own advice\n\n\n\nLet's stop before it gets messy\n\nLet's stop before it gets heavy\n\nIt's not too late to say you never met me\n\nLet's stop before it gets messy\n\n\n\nI try to tell myself that you gotta take it slow\n\nI always jump in way too fast, yeah\n\nIf you wake up and I'm not there\n\nIt's nothing personal\n\nJust got some problems from my past, yeah\n\n\n\nIf there's a line, then I think that we crossed it\n\nSecond time you stay the night\n\nIf there's a cool, then I think that I lost it\n\nAnd I should take my own advice\n\n\n\nLet's stop before it gets messy\n\nLet's stop before it gets heavy\n\nIt's not too late to say you never met me\n\nLet's stop before it gets messy\n\nBefore it gets messy\n\n\n\nMessy\n\nTake another look at myself\n\nBefore it gets messy\n\n\n\nIf there's a line, then I think that we crossed it\n\nSecond time you stay the night\n\nIf there's a cool, then I think that I lost it\n\nAnd I should take my own advice\n\n\n\nLet's stop before it gets messy\n\nLet's stop before it gets heavy\n\nIt's not too late to say you never met me\n\nLet's stop before it gets messy",
