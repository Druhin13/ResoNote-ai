  "lyrics": "I get so distracted \nBy some peoples reactions \nThat I don't see my own faults \nFor what they are \nFor what they are\n\nAt times so self destructive\n\nWith no intent or motive\n\nBut behind this emotion,\n\nThere lies a sensible heart\n\nA sensible heart\n\n\n\nSee I'm no king\n\nI wear no crown\n\nBut desperate times\n\nSeem over now\n\nBut still I weaken somehow\n\nIt tears me apart \n\nIt tears me apart\n\n\n\nI hope to learn as time goes by\n\nThat I should trust what's deep inside\n\nBurning bright, oh burning bright\n\nMy sensible heart \n\nMy sensible heart\n\nMy sensible heart\n\nMy sensible heart",
