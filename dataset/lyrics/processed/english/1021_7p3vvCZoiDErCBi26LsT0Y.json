  "lyrics": "And so I wonder, wonder where my home is\r\nWhere I come from, how the makers sowed it\r\nThe constellations, how we all connected\r\nIn the hall all rows intersected\r\nTrue blue ocean, the meaning feels heavy\n\nBut I let go, I let go, stay ready\n\nBy the roots of my toes I am steady\n\nI don't take from the road I've got plenty\n\n\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander, body and soul\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander, body and soul\n\n\n\nWell the dreamer passed along a message\n\nIt's been a long time friend since you've rested\n\nI got a map to all things that you're guessing\n\nLike the halo you're constantly testing\n\n\n\nA deep breath is the medicine I needin'\n\nThe elders asking me which wolf you feedin'\n\nThey got me roaming through all the four seasons\n\nBut their love is a love I believe in\n\n\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander, body and soul\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander, body and soul\n\n\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander, body and soul\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander\n\nMy home is where I wander, body and soul",
