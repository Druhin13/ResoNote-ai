I want you to show up\n\nWould you throw me a bone?\n\nI've been out here makin' lemonade with all your lemons\n\nYou would think by now I'd have learned a hundred lessons (1, 2, 3)\n\nBut I'm stupid with it\n\nCut, feel the burn of another scene (ow)\n\nI don't wanna get mean on my sixteens\n\nBut you don't ever wanna listen to me\n\nWon't you play\n\nYou've been givin' me extraterrestrial readings\n\n\n\nI love you, I mean it if you do\n\nTell me we're sippin' the same brew\n\nHooked on the Kool-Aid, I'm thirsty for good news\n\n\n\nMore than I love, more than I love, more than I love myself\n\nMore than I love, more than I love, more than I love myself\n\n(More than I love, more than I love)\n\nMore than I love, more than I love, more than I love my\n\n(More than I love, more than I love)\n\n\n\nI love you more than I love myself, boy\n\nAnd I love myself way too fucking much\n\nDon't you play with me\n\nI love you more than I love myself, boy\n\nAnd my love for you, caught it from the jump\n\nI love you more than I love myself, boy\n\nAnd I love myself way too fucking much\n\nDon't you play with me",
