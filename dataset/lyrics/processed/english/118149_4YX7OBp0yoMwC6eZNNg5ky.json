  "lyrics": "I'd lose my way and I'd lose my mind\r\nIf I faced one day on my own\r\nI know I was saved\r\nThe night that she gave this drifter's heart a home\r\nEvery night I should be on my knees\n\nLord knows how lucky I am\n\nI'll never say near enough\n\nThank God for this woman, Amen\n\n\n\nThis world has a way of shaking your faith\n\nI've been broken again and again\n\nBut I need all the cracks in my shattered heart\n\n'Cause that's where her love gets in\n\n\n\nEvery night I should be on my knees\n\nLord knows how lucky I am\n\nI'll never say near enough\n\nThank God for this woman, Amen\n\n\n\nShe gives me faith\n\nShe gives me grace\n\nShe gives me hope\n\nShe gives me strength\n\nShe gives me love\n\nLove without end\n\nThank God for this woman, Amen\n\n\n\nThanks for the moon and the stars up above\n\nForgiveness' a sin in your undying love\n\nEvery twist, every turn for the way, you made sure\n\nAll my roads led to home\n\n\n\nSo tonight I will fall down on my knees\n\n'Cause Lord knows how lucky I am\n\nI'm gonna shout at the top of my lungs\n\nThank God for this woman, Amen\n\nAnd thank God for this woman, Amen\n\n\n\nShe gives me faith\n\nShe gives me grace\n\nShe gives me hope\n\nShe gives me strength\n\nShe gives me love\n\nLove without end\n\nThank God for this woman, Amen",
