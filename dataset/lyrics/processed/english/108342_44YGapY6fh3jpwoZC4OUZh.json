  "lyrics": "The festival was over, the boys were all plannin' for a fall,\r\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drillin' in the wall.\r\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gamblin' wheel shut down,\r\nAnyone with any sense had already left town.\r\nHe was standin' in the doorway lookin' like the Jack of Hearts.\n\nHe moved across the mirrored room, \"Set it up for everyone,\" he said,\n\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doin' before he turned their heads. \n\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,\n\n\"Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?\"\n\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nBackstage the girls were playin' five-card stud by the stairs,\n\nLily had two queens, she was hopin' for a third to match her pair.\n\nOutside the streets were fillin' up, the window was open wide,\n\nA gentle breeze was blowin', you could feel it from inside.\n\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nBig Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,\n\nHe made his usual entrance lookin' so dandy and so fine.\n\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,\n\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste.\n\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,\n\nShe slipped in through the side door lookin' like a queen without a crown.\n\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,\n\n\"Sorry, darlin', that I'm late,\" but he didn't seem to hear.\n\nHe was starin' into space over at the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\n\"I know I've seen that face before,\" Big Jim was thinkin' to himself,\n\n\"Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf.\"\n\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim\n\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,\n\nStarin' at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,\n\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled. \n\nShe'd come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\n\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere.\n\nBut she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nThe hangin' judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,\n\nThe drillin' in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind.\n\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring\n\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king.\n\nNo, nothin' ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nRosemary started drinkin' hard and seein' her reflection in the knife,\n\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playin' the role of Big Jim's wife.\n\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,\n\nWas lookin' to do just one good deed before she died.\n\nShe was gazin' to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nLily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away.\n\n\"Has your luck run out?\" she laughed at him, \"Well, I guess you must\n\nhave known it would someday.\n\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint,\n\nI'm glad to see you're still alive, you're lookin' like a saint.\"\n\nDown the hallway footsteps were comin' for the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair.\n\n\"There's something funny going on,\" he said, \"I can just feel it in the air.\"\n\nHe went to get the hangin' judge, but the hangin' judge was drunk,\n\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk.\n\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nLily's arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch,\n\nShe forgot all about the man she couldn't stand who hounded her so much.\n\n\"I've missed you so,\" she said to him, and he felt she was sincere,\n\nBut just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear.\n\nJust another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick,\n\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked.\n\nAnd Big Jim was standin' there, ya couldn't say surprised,\n\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes.\n\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leanin' to the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\n\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a haul.\n\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\n\nFor one more member who had business back in town.\n\nBut they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nThe next day was hangin' day, the sky was overcast and black,\n\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back.\n\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,\n\nThe hangin' judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink.\n\nThe only person on the scene missin' was the Jack of Hearts.\n\n\n\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, \"Closed for repair,\"\n\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\n\nShe was thinkin' 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,\n\nThinkin' 'bout Rosemary and thinkin' about the law.\n\nBut, most of all she was thinkin' 'bout the Jack of Hearts",
