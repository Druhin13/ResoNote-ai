  "lyrics": "I've walked a million miles\r\nTo chase down my own desires\r\nOut of fire, sea and stone\r\nBorn to find that great unknown\r\nAnd when I find my joy, I'ma bring it on home\n\nBring it on home, bring it on home\n\nBring it on home\n\nWhen I find my joy, I'ma bring it on home\n\nBring it on home, bring it on home\n\nBring it on home\n\nWhen I find my joy, I'ma bring it on home\n\nYeah\n\nI hung my heart up to dry\n\nOn rooftops under blue skies\n\nNo, I never would have grown if I'd never been alone\n\nSo when I find my love, I'ma bring it on home (Come on)\n\n\n\nBring it on home, bring it on home\n\nBring it on home\n\nWhen I find my love, I'ma bring it on home\n\nBring it on home, bring it on home\n\nBring it on home\n\nWhen I find my love, I'ma bring it on home\n\n(Yeah, whoo!)\n\n\n\nWhen I find my love\n\nWhen I find my love, I'ma bring it on home\n\n\n\nI've run the highest wire\n\nI've laughed, smiled, cried and been called a liar\n\nI thought to myself, win, lose or fail\n\nI won't let this train derail\n\nAnd when I find myself, I'ma bring it on home\n\n\n\nBring it on home, bring it on home\n\nBring it on home\n\nWhen I find myself, I'ma bring it on home\n\nBring it on home, bring it on home\n\nBring it on home\n\nAnd when I find myself, I'ma bring it on home\n\n\n\nHome, home is where the heart is\n\nLove is where you'll find it\n\nI'ma bring it on home, I'ma bring it on home\n\nHome, home is where the heart is\n\nLove is where you'll find it\n\nI'ma bring it on home, I'ma bring it on home\n\n\n\nHome, home, home, bring it on home\n\nWhen I find myself, I'ma bring it on home\n\nHome, home, home, bring it on home\n\nWhen I find myself, I'ma bring it on home",
