  "lyrics": "I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.\r\nI shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.\r\nAll around in my home town\r\nThey're trying to track me down.\r\nThey say they want to bring me in guilty\n\nFor the killing of a deputy,\n\nFor the life of a deputy.\n\nBut I say:\n\n\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.\n\nI shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offense.\n\n\n\nSheriff John Brown always hated me;\n\nFor what I don't know.\n\nEvery time that I plant a seed\n\nHe said, \"Kill it before it grows.\"\n\nHe said, \"Kill it before it grows.\"\n\nI say:\n\n\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defense.\n\n\n\nFreedom came my way one day\n\nAnd I started out of town.\n\nAll of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown\n\nAiming to shoot me down.\n\nSo I shot, I shot him down.\n\nI say:\n\n\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy.\n\n\n\nReflexes got the better of me\n\nAnd what is to be must be.\n\nEvery day the bucket goes to the well,\n\nBut one day the bottom will drop out,\n\nYes, one day the bottom will drop out.\n\nBut I say:\n\n\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no.\n\nI shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy, oh no.",
