  "lyrics": "I said \"why do you chase me so\r\nWhen you know i won't give in\"\r\nHe paused at me, his eyes narrowed\r\nHe said i can't help it (you little bitch)\r\nAnd so he listened while i told\r\nAnd he answered when i asked\n\nAnd with the stories of my soul\n\nHe drew a map\n\n\n\nHe doesn't do what i want when i want it\n\nBut he does what i need when i need it\n\nGosh damn, somehow that man, he knows the difference\n\nHe doesn't do what i want when i want it\n\nBut he does what i need when i need it\n\nGosh damn, somehow that man, he knows the difference\n\n\n\nHe breathes embers into sparks\n\nJust to keep my body warm at night\n\nTakes the temperature of my heart\n\nAnd keeeps the stars i hang my deams on in his sight\n\n& i will go to any length to live up to the strength\n\nHe knows i have I will travel any route\n\nTo give up doubt of the woman he knows i am\n\n\n\nHe doesn't do what i want when i want it\n\nBut he does what i need when i need it\n\nGosh damn, somehow that man, he knows the difference\n\nHe doesn't do what i want when i want it\n\nBut he does what i need when i need it\n\nGosh damn, somehow that man, he knows the difference\n\nLord knows only time will tell\n\nIf ever i'll blush for someone else\n\nHe compels me with his heartfelt\n\nHonesty unparalleled\n\nHe peers around my learning curve\n\nCalls me on my shortsighted nerve\n\nKnows me better than i know myself\n\n\n\nHe doesn't do what i want when i want it\n\nBut he does what i need when i need it\n\nGosh damn, somehow that man, he knows the difference\n\nHe doesn't do what i want when i want it\n\nBut he does what i need when i need it\n\nGosh damn, somehow that man, he knows the difference\n\n\n\nHe doesn't follow where i walk\n\nBut if i turn, he will be there\n\nHow can a man who's such a rock\n\nBe lighter than the air?\n\n\n\nSomehow he knows the difference",
