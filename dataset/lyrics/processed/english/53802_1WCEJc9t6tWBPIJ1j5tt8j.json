  "lyrics": "He had hair down to his shoulders and a white cowboy hat\r\nHe wore a dusty poncho with a guitar on his back\r\nHe sang all the sweetest songs that I have ever known\r\nHis name was Pablo\r\nAs he strummed his guitar, how his fingers they would dance\n\nHe sang like an angel and he put me in a trance\n\nThe seed of love within my heart, each day it would grow\n\nFor my darling Pablo\n\n\n\nPablo, amado mío\n\nEres mi fuego, eres mi corazón\n\nCantar, cantar mi Pablo\n\nCon tu guitarra, cantar mi corazón\n\nPablo\n\n\n\nHe rode in on a dark horse with a broken, tortured soul\n\nHis poetry spoke to me, his words they would console\n\nAll the pain within my heart, but I am not alone\n\nNow that I've got Pablo\n\n\n\nPablo, amado mío\n\nEres mi fuego, eres mi corazón\n\nCantar, cantar mi Pablo\n\nCon tu guitarra, cantar mi corazón\n\nPablo\n\n\n\nPablo, amado mío\n\nEres mi fuego, eres mi corazón\n\nCantar, cantar mi Pablo\n\nCon tu guitarra, cantar mi corazón\n\nPablo\n\nOh, Pablo\n\nPablo",
