  "lyrics": "Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,\r\nIn the lane, snow is glistening\r\nA beautiful sight,\r\nWe're happy tonight,\r\nWalking in a winter wonderland.\n\nGone away is the bluebird,\n\nHere to stay is a new bird\n\nHe sings a love song,\n\nAs we go along,\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland.\n\n\n\nIn the meadow we can build a snowman,\n\nThen pretend that he is Parson Brown\n\nHe'll say: Are you married?\n\nWe'll say: No man,\n\nBut you can do the job\n\nWhen you're in town.\n\n\n\nLater on, we'll conspire,\n\nAs we dream by the fire\n\nTo face unafraid,\n\nThe plans that we've made,\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland.\n\n\n\nIn the meadow we can build a snowman,\n\nAnd pretend that he's a circus clown\n\nWe'll have lots of fun with mister snowman,\n\nUntil the other kids knock him down.\n\n\n\nWhen it snows, ain't it thrilling,\n\nThough your nose gets a chilling\n\nWe'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland.\n\n\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland,\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland",
