  "lyrics": "I used to say I was free\r\nNow all these people wanna keep on taking pieces of me\r\nThey take away everything, had everything that I needed\r\nThey held me down, let me drown\r\nThey spit me out right through the teeth\r\nI can't pretend, ash in the wind, won't blow again\n\nIt was a breeze for you\n\nThese hurricanes inside of my brain, let it rain, made it look easy Can't look away, you love the pain, you love the pain\n\n\n\nWatchin' me bleed\n\nYou cut me down on my knees\n\nNo matter what you believe\n\nI think we both can agree\n\n\n\nThat you can't blame it on me, yeah\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nBlame it on me\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nI couldn't breathe\n\nAlmost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all\n\nYou can't blame it on me\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\n\n\nEveryday's the same, yeah, I just watch 'em go\n\nAs I scrape away through the impossible\n\nYeah, I played the game but it was all for show\n\nTryna find my way, I nearly lost it though\n\nNow I see dead people, most have no faith\n\nWhere did the time go? A watch with no face\n\nThey hit the ceiling but my roof likes space\n\nI took my chances so won't you\n\n\n\nBlame it on me\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nBlame it on me, ayy\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nI couldn't breathe\n\nAlmost lost myself, couldn't stop myself, I did it all\n\nYou can't blame it on me\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault, not my fault\n\n\n\nIt's all my fault that I'm addicted to the clothes\n\nIt's all my fault, I paid the cost, yeah\n\nIt's all my fault that I ain't givin' up my soul\n\nIt's all my fault\n\n\n\nWatchin' me bleed\n\nYou cut me down on my knees\n\nNo matter what you believe\n\nI think we both can agree\n\n\n\nThat you can't blame it on me\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nBlame it on me\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nI couldn't breathe\n\nAlmost lost myself, couldn't stop myself I did it all\n\nYou can't blame it on me, ayy\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\n\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault\n\nBlame it on me, yeah\n\nIt's not my fault, it's not my fault, it's not my fault",
