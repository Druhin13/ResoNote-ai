  "lyrics": "I read the letters that you wrote\r\nThough they weren't meant for me\r\nAnd that time that we spoke\r\nI died patiently\r\nNow I hear that you're broken\r\nI guess it's meant to be\n\nSee I have salvaged your token\n\nShe's safe between my knees\n\nMy knees, my knees\n\n\n\nDarling dear, you don't know me\n\nYou've only guessed my time\n\nYou climbed your tower of devotion\n\nThough you past your prime\n\nOnce the cancer gets cut\n\nI will breathe just fine\n\nAnd those letters that you wrote\n\nThey will escape my mind\n\nMy mind, my mind",
