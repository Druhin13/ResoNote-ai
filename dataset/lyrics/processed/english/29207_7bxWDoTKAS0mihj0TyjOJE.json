  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Northern Boy par The Academic\r\nGive me your hand and we can say hello\nYour daddy is big but his mind is slow\nMeet me out the back in ten\nShe's tired of playing pretend\n\nIf she calls, I will tell her\nIf she calls tonight\nAnd if she calls, I will be there\nI'll be there just like a light\n\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd this ain't a game of love\nAnd don't be afraid to love\nAnd love again\nI don't get the way you feel\nAnd this ain't a movie reel\n\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd love again\n\nI'm making my way to my brother's house\nHe's calling her phone\nWhile she's holding her blouse\nShe snuck out the back\nWith some Northern Boy\nAnd now she's sleeping in a forest\nTryna find some joy\n\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd this ain't a game of love\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd love again\nI don't get the way you feel\nThis ain't a movie reel\nDon't be afraid to love\n\nAnd love again\n\nCan't you hear me scream out?\nFor broken hearts on the run\nCan't you hear me scream out?\nFor broken hearts on the run\n\nWe'll take a trip to California\nAnd we'll forget what we've lost\nWe'll take a trip down to the coastline\nWhere lost angels are cursed\nAnd there's a groom there drinking coffee\nThe coffee's cold like my heart\nAnd there's a birthmark on her shoulders\nA birthmark I've seen from the start\n\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd this ain't a game of love\n\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd love again\nI don't get the way you feel\nAnd thhis ain't a movie reel\nDon't be afraid to love\nAnd love again\n\nOh, don't be afraid to love\nAnd love again",
