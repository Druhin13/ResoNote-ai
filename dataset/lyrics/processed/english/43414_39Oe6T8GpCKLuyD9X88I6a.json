  "lyrics": "There are roads that guide you like some old familiar soul\r\nFollowing the feeling as it takes her to coast\r\nMemories of her childhood buried underground\r\nSearching for the bones of the stories never found\r\nOf the stories never found\n\nLost inside\n\nDreaming of the crossing\n\nThe diaries well kept\n\nPull on the threads\n\nIn the bracelets where she slept\n\nIn your arms\n\nFloating in the shallows\n\nWith the one you miss the most\n\nFootprints in the sand\n\nFrom your dancing with a ghost\n\nYou're dancing with a ghost\n\nDancing with a ghost\n\n\n\nA bible with a family tree\n\nBroken at the spine\n\nA symphony of questions\n\nSuspended out of time\n\nStill she makes her way\n\nFrom the mountain to the sea\n\nTrain of tangled thoughts\n\nBlows like the fallen leaves\n\nLike the fallen leaves\n\n\n\nLost inside\n\nWaiting for her father\n\nWaiting on a friend\n\nWaiting for forgiveness\n\nFrom the other end\n\nIn your arms\n\nHolding all the letters\n\nFrom the attic chest\n\nTracing the words\n\nHe whispered as he left\n\nWhispered as he left\n\nWhispered as he left\n\n\n\nLost inside\n\nDriving down the coastline\n\nThrough the rain alone\n\n\"Blackbird\" on the radio\n\nSings [?] someone\n\nIn your eyes\n\nFloating in the shadows\n\nWith the one you miss the most\n\nFootprints in the sand\n\nFrom your dancing with a ghost\n\nDancing with a ghost\n\nDancing with a ghost\n\nDancing with a ghost\n\nYou're just dancing...\n\nYou're just dancing with a ghost",
