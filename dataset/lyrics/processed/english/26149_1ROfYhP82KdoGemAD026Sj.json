  "lyrics": "I mouth your name a thousand times\r\nBut never could prepare\r\nTo know exactly what you are\r\nThe blissful unaware\r\nAnd every chosen memory\n\nCarves into my skin\n\nIt slips with every fading smile\n\nSinking further in\n\n\n\nAnd as I reach into the night\n\nGrasping for your connection in some way\n\nTo find myself again\n\nThere is more of this to come\n\n\n\nThere is nothing that I cannot be\n\nWithout a way to separate the dream from reality\n\n\n\nAnd as the red punches through the night\n\nFeasting on ambition\n\nOpen to a multitude of light\n\nPulling me down to the deepest core\n\n\n\nAnd as I reach into the night\n\nI'm grasping for you\n\nAching for that imagined perpetuity\n\nFeeding me\n\nFeeding love, feeding rage\n\n\n\nI'm beginning to see me through\n\nMy conscience, my existance, my all\n\n\n\nFlickers of feathers and swords in the new thrive\n\nI've been waiting for signals from you all along to dive\n\n\n\nThere is nothing that I cannot be\n\nWithout a way to separate the dream from reality\n\n\n\nThere is nothing that I cannot be\n\nWithout a way to separate the dream from reality",
