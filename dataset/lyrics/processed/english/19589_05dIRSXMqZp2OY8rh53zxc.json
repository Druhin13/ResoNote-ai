  "lyrics": "Was a time I laid awake\r\nThinking of birthday cake or snow\r\nNow the music's, getting old\r\nThe night is just a sigh, lead to slow\r\nAnyway you said you wanna go, oh,\r\nI guess it's the time. we can go to my house\r\nI'll take you in, where you can stare at my mouth\r\nI used to be a talker, but that's all behind me now\r\nThey fly to Lotus Lane\r\nOld folks in bowling shirts and gray\r\nPlaying Rumi on the fold-out tray\r\nHe does his well-known bit about\r\nseat belt demonstration and I\r\nI'm somewhere far away,\r\nwatching little lies, all along the beltway\r\nThose Indica blues,\r\nyou pretend to be proud\r\nThis is how it comes\r\ncan you swim, get out\r\nI used to be a fighter, but that's all behind me now\r\nIt's a long way to the end\r\nand I got my quatrters in, up on this face\r\nBut I can feel the breeze is, closing in\r\nLet's act like if she's sweat on my brow\r\nYou'll be fighting fire and I'll be around\r\nI used to be a dreamer, but that's all behind me",
