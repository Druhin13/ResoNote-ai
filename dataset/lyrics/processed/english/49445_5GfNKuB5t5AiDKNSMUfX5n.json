  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Torch par Mobley\r\nAnd when it started we were tongue-tied, taken, rather fond of being carried alight\nAnd when we part, it's such an odd sensation. It's a love like being buried alive\n\nSay, say morning, yeah I know the day is forming, but we haven't quite yet finished our night\nSay, say gloaming, now before you get to roaming, won't you stay a spell here stemming the tide?\nThe end of time\n\nAnd when we landed we were shell-shocked, shaken. There's a glassy look of doubt in your eyes\nNo more abandon, just a plea for patience, while I slowly burn away my disguise\nSay, say worry, never waited, never hurried. Did I hope to have my gray matter mined?\n\nSay, say glory, I'm a cautionary story. If he stares at me the sun'll go blind\nThe end of time\n\nWhen it comes for me, desire, I'm a wooden man and you throw me onto the pyre\nWill you watch me burn? Are you tired?\nI'm all alone",
