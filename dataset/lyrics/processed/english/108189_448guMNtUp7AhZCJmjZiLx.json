  "lyrics": "One of these nights,\r\nOne of these crazy old nights,\r\nWe're gonna find out, pretty mama,\r\nWhat turns on your lights.\r\nThe full moon is callin',\n\nThe fever is high,\n\nAnd the wicked wind whispers and moans.\n\nYou got your demons,\n\nYou got desires,\n\nWell, I've got a few of my own.\n\n\n\nOoo, someone to be kind to\n\nIn between the dark and the light\n\nComin' right behind you,\n\nSwear I'm gonna find you\n\nOne of these nights\n\n\n\nOne of these dreams,\n\nOne of these lost and lonely dreams, now,\n\nWe're gonna find one,\n\nOne that really screams.\n\nI've been searching for the daughter of the devil himself,\n\nI've been searching for an angel in white.\n\nI've been waitin' for a woman that's a little of both,\n\nAnd I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight.\n\n\n\nOoo, loneliness will blind you\n\nIn between the wrong and the right.\n\nOoo, comin' right behind you,\n\nSwear I'm gonna find you\n\nOne of these nights\n\n\n\nOne of these nights\n\nIn between the dark and the light.\n\nComin' right behind you,\n\nSwear I'm gonna find you,\n\nGet you, baby, one of these nights\n\n\n\nOne of these nights\n\nOne of these nights\n\n(I can feel you, I can feel you)\n\nOne of these nights\n\nComin' right behind you,\n\nSwear I'm gonna find you now\n\nOne of these nights\n\n(It gets so dark, \n\nSo dark and cold and lonely)\n\nOne of these nights\n\nOne of these crazy, crazy, crazy nights.",
