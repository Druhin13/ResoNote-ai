  "lyrics": "[Spoken:]\r\nShe was living in a single room w/ 3 other individuals, one of them was a male, and the other two, well hell the other two were females. God only knows what they were up to in there, and furthermore Susan I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoked marijuana cigarettes..... reefers\r\nI smoke two joints in the morning\r\nI smoke two joint at night\r\nI smoke two joint in the afternoon\n\nIt makes me feel all right\n\n\n\nI smoke two joints in time of peace\n\nAnd two in time of war\n\nI smoke two joints before I smoke two joints,\n\nAnd then I smoke two more\n\n\n\nDaddy he once told me,\n\n\"Son, you be hard workin' man\"\n\nAnd momma she once told me,\n\n\"Son, you do the best you can\"\n\nThen one day I meet a man,\n\nHe came to me and said,\n\n\"Hard work good and hard work fine,\n\nbut first take care of head\"\n\n\n\nWhoa rock me to the night\n\nJa say",
