  "lyrics": "Sometimes, at night I let it get to me.\r\nAnd sometimes, I'm sure it gets to all of us.\r\nAnd last night it had me down, I'm feeling numb.\r\nI can try, but sometimes that is not enough.\r\nNo, sometimes that is not enough.\r\nNo, sometimes that is not enough.\n\n\n\nAnd stop calling me out,\n\nWe're never going to put the pieces back together if you won't let me get better.\n\nAnd stop digging it up,\n\nOr we're never gonna see it all in bloom.\n\n\n\nAnd thinking back upon those days,\n\nWay, way back when I was young,\n\nI was such a little shit,\n\nCause I was always on the run.\n\nWell you know just what they say\n\n\"I just like father then like son\"\n\nDon't delude me with your sympathy,\n\nCause I can do this on my own.\n\n\n\nAnd this won't be the last time that I break down and wanna crawl to bed,\n\nCause the truth is, you're the only voice I wanna hear in my head.\n\n\n\nSo stop calling me out,\n\nWe're never going to put the pieces back together if you won't let me get better.\n\nAnd stop digging it up,\n\nOr we're never gonna see it all in bloom.\n\n\n\nAnd stop calling me out,\n\nWe're never going to put the pieces back together if you won't let me get better.\n\nAnd stop digging it up,\n\nOr we're never gonna see it all in bloom.\n\nAll in bloom.\n\nAll in bloom.",
