  "lyrics": "Some lovers meet out in the street\r\nThey make out, move in, and move on\r\nAnd there's ones like us, who canâ€™t get enough\r\nWith you is where I belong\r\nSome folks will follow whoever they feel\n\nWill make 'em feel good for a night\n\nBut others like us will hold on forever\n\nFeel good for the rest of our lives\n\n\n\nThe difference between lovers and lovers in love:\n\nSome take just a sip, while some drink it up\n\nSome leave, some stay when the going gets tough\n\nThat's the difference between lovers and lovers in love\n\n\n\nThere's those who just drink until they can't think\n\nAnd let strangers sleep in their beds\n\nBut you and me, babe, I'm happy to say\n\nWe wake up and have no regrets\n\n\n\nThe difference between lovers and lovers in love:\n\nSome take just a sip, while some drink it up\n\nSome leave, some stay when the going gets tough\n\nThat's the difference between lovers and lovers in love\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between lovers and lovers in love:\n\nSome take just a sip, while some drink it up\n\nSome leave, some stay when the going gets tough\n\nThat's the difference between lovers and lovers in love\n\nLovers in love",
