  "lyrics": "Did you ever have to make up your mind,\r\nAnd pick up on one, \nAnd leave the other behind,\r\nIt's not often easy and not often kind,\r\nDid you ever have to make up your mind?\r\nDid you ever have to finally decide,\n\nAnd say yes to one, \n\nAnd let the other one ride,\n\nThere's so many changes, \n\nAnd tears you must hide,\n\nDid you ever have to finally decide?\n\nSometimes there's one with deep blue eyes, \n\nCute as a bunny,\n\nWith hair down to here, \n\nAnd plenty of money,\n\nAnd just when you think, \n\nShe's that one in the world,\n\nYour heart gets stolen, \n\nBy some mousy little girl.\n\nAnd then you know, \n\nYou better make up your mind,\n\nAnd pick up on one, \n\nAnd leave the other behind,\n\nIt's not often easy and not often kind,\n\nDid you ever have to make up your mind?\n\nSometimes you really dig a girl, \n\nThe moment you kiss her,\n\nAnd then you get distracted, \n\nBy her older sister,\n\nWhen in walks her father, \n\nAnd takes you in line,\n\nAnd says, better go home, son, \n\nAnd make up your mind.\n\nThen you bet, \n\nYou'd better finally decide,\n\nAnd say yes to one, \n\nAnd let the other one ride,\n\nThere's so many changes, \n\nAnd tears you must hide,\n\nDid you ever have to finally decide?",
