  "lyrics": "(Let the band play)\r\nStrike a match to a Marlboro red\r\nAnd feel the rush run straight to your head\r\nPop the top of a Budweiser bottle\r\nAnd kick it on, bang, crank up the throttle\n\nWe're headed to the riverside about sundown\n\nBreak out that guitar, pass that jar around\n\nAnd pass that jar around\n\n\n\n(Church)\n\nDon't pass me the jar, shit, just hand me the smoke\n\nShit everybody and their mama know I love rolling stoned\n\nBut hell the mamas and daughters be raging at all the shows\n\nTitties bouncing up and down in the first three rows\n\nBut ain't nobody special, shit I'm a country Caucasian\n\nAnd you can catch me at the river, windows up and I'm blazing\n\nWith a cutoff shirt, sunburnt, dawg I'm really from the thickest parts\n\nDon't hang out in my town, ain't nothing but the local Walmart\n\nThe only targets I see are riddled with rounds of lead\n\nAnd that ain't nothing but practice for when I aim at crackheads\n\nSo watch your ass when you stroll in the town that I was raised in\n\nMight find your ass disintegrated at the bottom of the pig pen\n\n\n\nStrike a match to a Marlboro red\n\nAnd feel the rush run straight to your head\n\nPop the top of a Budweiser bottle\n\nAnd kick it on, bang, crank up the throttle\n\nWe're headed to the riverside about sundown\n\nBreak out that guitar, pass that jar around\n\nAnd pass that jar around\n\n\n\n(Yes sir)\n\nWell pass me the jar boy, 'cause I ain't scared\n\nI got a million fucking honkeys and their necks all red\n\nI got a little piece of land deep down in the cut\n\nWhere we grow our own, tobacca, put the diesel in jugs\n\nBreak out that old six string and play us some riffs\n\nWhile the still keeps the beat and the moonshine drips\n\nAnd you can hear the pick and clear on the river tonight\n\nI've been known to shake the bushes and shoot out the light\n\nMotherfucking redneck nation, you know we run shit\n\nSo pile your ass up in a truck, let's get lit and shoot shit\n\nSo pass me the jar and light up the smoke\n\nI pop the top off this bitch [?] (That's right)\n\n\n\nStrike a match to a Marlboro red\n\nAnd feel the rush run straight to your head\n\nPop the top of a Budweiser bottle\n\nAnd kick it on, bang, crank up the throttle\n\nWe're headed to the riverside about sundown\n\nBreak out that guitar, pass that jar around\n\nAnd pass that jar around",
