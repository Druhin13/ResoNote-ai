What?)\nAnd I beat on my chest, you could see that I'm ape\n\n[ABG Neal]\nIt’s ABG, I bust out .83 and make 'em hula hoop\nWho is you? Opps walk past me like they don't know who to shoot\nTrap be jumping like a frog, I'm with my dog like Scooby Doo\nBought my Lucky Charm, but the diamonds look like Fruity Loops\n\n\n[Krimelife Ca$$]\nLike who is who? I bust up out the coupe, I might just shoot at you\nHe acting tough, I might just have to show him what that Ruger do\nAnd I'm shooting like the magic, show 'em what that voodoo do\nI'm pulling up with that (*gun cocks*), it go doo doo doo (Blat!)\n\n[ABG Neal]\nPull up we bustin', not for discussion\nWe play with drums like shit is percussion\nStay with the hammer like this is construction\nDrink too much Henny, might shoot up the function\n\n[Krimelife Ca$$]\nNot with the cuffin’, I only want fuckin’\n\nSipping this D'Usse, I might just start dumping\nTake down the plug, and now he got nothing\nTrap steady booming, they got my phone jumping\nNiggas they see me and start Forrest Gumping\nStay talking hot but I know they be bluffing\n(Niggas they see me and start Forrest Gumping\nStay talking hot but I know they be bluffing)",
