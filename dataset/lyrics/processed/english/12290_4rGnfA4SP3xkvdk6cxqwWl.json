  "lyrics": "Twenty miles down a desert road\r\nIf you walk that far, ain't never comin' home\r\nNever comin' home\r\nSonoran sun, it never quits\r\nIf you cover your neck, it'll burn your lips\r\nThorns in his hair, dust in his teeth\n\nCoyote [?] the Land of the Free\n\n[?] the Land of the Free\n\nLand of the Free\n\n\n\nThere is always a reason\n\nA story to tell\n\nBut you cannot measure a man until you've been down the deepest well\n\n\n\nAnd when I get to the Land of the Brave\n\nGonna buy me a hammer and move all day\n\nSend it all back to the family, save a few bucks for that Bow King\n\nStand outside that hardware store, don't matter the job they need me for\n\nNeed me for\n\n\n\nThere is always a reason\n\nA story to tell\n\nBut you cannot measure a man until you've been down the deepest well\n\n\n\nThere is always a reason\n\nA story to tell\n\nBut you cannot measure a man until you've been down the deepest well",
