  "lyrics": "I see the signs of a lifetime, you 'til I die\r\nAnd I'm swiftly out, I wish goodbye\r\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\r\nLove\r\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\n\n\nI'd like to get to know you\n\nI'd like to take you out\n\nWe'd go to the Hail Mary\n\nAnd afterwards make out\n\nInstead I'm typing you a message\n\nThat I know I'll never send\n\nRewriting old excuses\n\nDelete the kisses at the end\n\nWhen I see you, the whole world reduces\n\nTo just that room\n\nAnd then I remember and I'm shy\n\nThat gossip's eye will look too soon\n\nAnd then I'm trapped, overthinking\n\nAnd yeah, probably self-doubt\n\nYou tell me to get over it\n\nAnd to take you out\n\nBut I can't, I'm too scared\n\nAnd there's the night-bus, I have to go\n\nAnd the doors are closing and you were waving\n\nAnd I like you, and I'll never let it show\n\nAnd you won't wait and maybe I won't mind\n\nI work better on my own\n\nAnd now I'm, well, a bit drunk\n\nAnd I ask myself\n\n\n\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\n\n\nA few days pass since I last saw you\n\nAnd you have taken over my mind\n\nI'm re-telling jokes you made that made me laugh\n\nPretending that they're mine\n\nI wanna tell the whole world about you\n\nI think that that's a sign\n\nI'm losing self control and it's you\n\nIt really is, one thousand times\n\nI look at your picture and I smile\n\nHow awful's that? I'm like a teenage girl\n\nI might as well write all over my notebook\n\nThat you 'rock my world!'\n\nYou do, you really do\n\nYou've turned me upside down\n\nAnd that's okay, I'll let it happen\n\n'Cause I like having you around\n\nI'm a love-trick, a romantic cliche\n\nAnd they really are all true\n\nAnd we catch eyes in a stupid party\n\nI know exactly what to do\n\nI'll take your hand, and we will leave\n\nA French exit for me and you\n\nYou know I'm home, a little bit drunk\n\nSome things don't change\n\nAnd I know now\n\n\n\nMe and you were meant to be\n\nIn love\n\nMe and you were meant to be\n\nIn love\n\nMe and you\n\n\n\nI see the signs of a lifetime, you 'til I die",
