  "lyrics": "So you think you've got some county line cred\r\nCause you rode a dirt road or two\r\nYou got a mossy oak hat on top of your head\r\nAnd a southern pride tattoo\r\nYeah you might a drank a little grain alcohol\r\nOr hauled a little hay but if you think your boots\n\nGot more dirt than mine I got one thing to say\n\nMy town's smaller than your town\n\nAnd i got a bigger buck and bass on my wall\n\nGot a little more kick in my drawl\n\nY'all i got little more spit in my chaw\n\nMy truck's louder than your truck\n\nAnd my collar's a little more blue\n\nYou might think that you're redneck\n\nBut I'm rednecker than you\n\nYes I am\n\nI got a car parked in my front yard\n\nWith a floorboard full of slim jeans\n\nI piss where i want to\n\nAnd i fish Where i swim yeah\n\nI bet you you ain't got it on a tailgate\n\nOr killed a copperhead a time or two\n\nMan if you're thinking you're a better\n\nBeer drinker buddy I've got news for you\n\nMy town's smaller than your town\n\nAnd O got a bigger buck and bass on my wall\n\nGot a little more kick in my drawl\n\nY'all I got little more spit in my chaw\n\nMy truck's louder than your truck\n\nAnd my tick hound's a little more blue\n\nYou might think that you're redneck\n\nBut I'm rednecker than you\n\nI'm rednecker than you\n\nYeah I'm down with the sound\n\nOf a dixie whistle raising hell\n\nPraising dale twelve in at bristol\n\nMore sweat on my brow\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nSo needless to say\n\nMy town's smaller than your town\n\nAnd I got a bigger buck",
