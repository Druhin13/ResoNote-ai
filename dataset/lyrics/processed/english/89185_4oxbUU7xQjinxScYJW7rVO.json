  "lyrics": "Somewhere in a field of clover, \nshe waits for me\r\nShe frolics in the land, \nin a land of endless spring\r\nNo scavengers or machines, she is free\n\nBut somewhere in a field of clover, \n\nshe waits for me\n\nAnd as the cars go rollin' by, \n\nthe highway hums a lullaby\n\nAnd she's sleeping on the side of the street\n\nBut somewhere in a field of clover, \n\nshe waits for me\n\n\n\nNow I walk these hills alone with no little one\n\nTo stumble along after me\n\nBut somewhere in a field of clover, \n\nshe waits for me\n\nShe frolics in the land, \n\nin a land of endless spring\n\nNo scavengers or machines, \n\nshe is free",
