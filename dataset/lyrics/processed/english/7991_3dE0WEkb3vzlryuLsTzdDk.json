  "lyrics": "I love my baby, she's the light of the world\r\nShe wakes me up with the sun in her eyes\r\nShe's not perfect but she's my little girl\r\nAnd the night goes cold when she cries\r\nOh my baby, you're my angel\n\nWon't you come on down and put your arms around me?\n\nOh my darling, oh my angel\n\nWon't you come on down and rescue me?\n\n\n\nShe never tells me when I'm doing something wrong\n\nShe just pulls me gently, she leads me home\n\nSweetest beer that I have ever known\n\nAnd when the day dies she's still shining on\n\n\n\nOh my baby, you're my angel\n\nWon't you come on down and put your arms around me?\n\nOh my darling, oh my angel\n\nWon't you come on down and rescue me?\n\n\n\nI love my baby, she's the light of the world\n\nShe wakes me up with the sun in her eyes\n\nOh my baby, you're my angel\n\nWon't you come on down and put your arms around me?\n\nOh my darling, oh my angel\n\nWon't you come on down and rescue me?\n\nOh my baby, won't you?\n\nOh my darling, won't you?\n\nCome on down and put your arms around me\n\nOh my baby, won't you?\n\nOh my darling, won't you?\n\nCome on down and rescue me\n\nCome on down and rescue me, come on down and rescue me",
