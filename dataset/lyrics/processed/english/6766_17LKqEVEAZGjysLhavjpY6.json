  "lyrics": "It's the birth of a star, earlier than sunset\r\nIt's the galaxies water, flowing like a river babe\r\nIt's the rain, oh the rain\r\nDrown upon this summer day\r\nGrowing into a super nova\r\nBack to where we used to play\n\nIt's an infinity, as it feast on time\n\nCause it constantly leams perpetual design\n\nCause we worship the ?keeper?\n\nThe tide is going out now\n\nAs we look out to sea\n\nLegs sprawled and head down\n\n\n\nYes they shine bright like a million, let them blink twice for a minute\n\nPleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight\n\nTo have felt this oh sublime, Like a grain of sand travelling through time\n\nPleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight\n\nYes they shine bright like a million, let them blink twice for a minute\n\nPleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight\n\nTo have felt this oh sublime, Like a grain of sand travelling through time\n\nPleasure to have met you, you're my star tonight\n\n\n\nWe don't see eye to eye, we don't see eye to eye\n\nWe don't see eye to eye, we don't see eye to eye\n\n\n\nThe time it took to realise\n\nWhat you say bears sweet on my soul\n\nCompliments with no surprises\n\nMaking route straight to their home\n\n\n\nWe don't see eye to eye, we don't see eye to eye\n\nWe don't see eye to eye, We don't see eye to eye\n\n\n\n[?] improve this\n\nNot quite opting ?fury? now\n\nComplications falling useless\n\nAlone and ?still? I working out\n\n\n\nWe don't see eye to eye, we don't see eye to eye\n\nWe don't see eye to eye, We don't see eye to eye",
