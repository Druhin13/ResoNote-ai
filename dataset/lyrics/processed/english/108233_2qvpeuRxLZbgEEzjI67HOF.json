  "lyrics": "I love to watch a woman dance\r\nShe bows her head and lifts her hands\r\nHer hips begin to circle slowly\r\nHer eyes have closed; her face is holy\r\nShe holds the whole world in trance\r\nI love to watch a woman dance\n\nYeah, I love to watch a woman dance\n\n\n\nShe likes the slow songs of love lost\n\nThey take her a million miles away\n\n'Cause to dream, sometimes, is the only way\n\nTo go places you can't get to any other way\n\nOur eyes connect; she takes my hand\n\nI love to watch a woman dance\n\nYeah, I love to watch a woman dance\n\n\n\nI feel my heart beating, and I wonder\n\nWill it ever satisfy my longing?\n\nI'm gonna hold on to you for as long as I can\n\nFor who knows, this dance may be our only dance\n\n\n\nSo we danced together, close and slow\n\nSo slow we're almost standing still\n\nHer warm breath against my neck\n\nSlowly breaking down my will\n\nThe room spins so I can barely stand\n\nThe song ends; then, she lets go of my hand\n\nThere's so much I don't understand\n\nBut I love to watch a woman dance\n\nYeah, I love to watch a woman dance",
