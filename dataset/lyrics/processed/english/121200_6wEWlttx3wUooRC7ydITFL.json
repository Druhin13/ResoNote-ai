  "lyrics": "I roll with the punches\r\nI go with the flow\r\nI used to fight against the tide\r\nBut I learned my lesson and now I know\r\nThat there's a better way to live this life\r\nYou got to find your song and just sing it\n\nAnd there's a better way to feel alright\n\nLet it all go and let love take control\n\n\n\nI just ride\n\nOn a wave so free, just you and me\n\nComing alive\n\nFeels so good just to watching the world going by\n\nDoing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave\n\nOh, every day\n\nWhy would I wanna live any other way?\n\nThan just riding my wave? Yeah\n\n\n\nWe all got problems\n\nI've had my share of pain\n\nI got scars in places that you can't even see, baby\n\nBut it made me who I am today\n\nSo when it rains, when there's a hurricane\n\nYou got to find your wave and just surf it\n\nPut some love in the world, find a boy or a girl\n\nTo heal all the hurt 'cause you know you deserve it\n\n\n\nSo ride\n\nOn a wave so free, just you and me\n\nComing alive\n\nFeels so good just to watching the world going by\n\nDoing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave\n\nOh, every day\n\nWhy would I wanna live any other way?\n\nThan just riding my wave? Yeah\n\n\n\nYou gotta watch out for the shine blockers\n\nMe, I'm just a time stopper\n\nWait, huh, we gon' get whatever we get to\n\nLil mama, we gotta depend on the way\n\nLeanin' and dreamin'\n\nPullin' up on the scene and we sting 'em\n\nFocused and floatin', we drinkin' and singin'\n\n\n\nIt's been a long time coming but it's all for the best\n\nWhat we can't do alone, we can all do together\n\n\n\nLet's ride\n\nOh, oh\n\nWe're coming alive\n\nIt feels so good just to watching the world going by\n\nDoing my thing out here, vibing and riding my wave\n\nYeah, every day\n\nNow why would I wanna live any other way?\n\nRide\n\nEvery day, every day\n\nBy\n\nOh, every day, every day\n\nRide\n\nOh, oh, oh, I feel it, baby, woo, woo\n\nBy",
