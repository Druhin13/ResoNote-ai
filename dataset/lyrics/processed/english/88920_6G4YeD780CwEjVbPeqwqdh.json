  "lyrics": "All the Southern fried boys wind up greased\r\nAnd burn to buy the West Coast store the East\r\nThey tatter their clothes and drown in irony\r\nRobbed of something young, thus incomplete\r\nThey fade into the liberal bourgeoisie\r\nTheir hatred now inflamed to stoke your daughter's screams\n\nAnd ramble about Trump over Stellas\n\nAnd headline Coachella\n\n\n\nAnd everything they told me was wrong\n\nIs still in my heart to turn me on\n\nMy ego is built on all my pain\n\nI'm your migraine\n\nI somehow became a feminist\n\nWhen ten years ago I was feeding drinks\n\nTo women, I'd laugh at when they'd think\n\nAmongst my friends\n\nIt's such a lie",
