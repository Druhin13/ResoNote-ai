  "lyrics": "This is not what we wanted, I am lost, again\r\nAnd oh I thought you would be the one to guide me in\r\nAnd I wake at dawn, on a cold morning\r\nTo find you gone, you slipped away\r\nAnd I belonged, but now I feel so out of place\n\nWell it's a long way down\n\nWhen you fall in love and out\n\nIt's a long way down down down\n\n\n\nWhat was once so familiar\n\nWhat stood strong began to sway\n\nAnd I felt at home\n\nBut now I know that home is just some place I stay\n\n\n\nAnd it's a long way down\n\nWhen you fall in love and out\n\nIt's a long way down no\n\n\n\nIt's a long way down\n\nWhen you fall in love and out\n\nIt's a long way down down down",
