Quit being silly\n\nI know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga\n\nCause I do it better, plus I'm doing better than niggas\n\nI'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga\n\n'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga\n\nUnc said Lil T, \"Get ahead of them niggas\"\n\nWhen you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas\n\nYou killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas\n\nDon't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga\"\n\nSo let me know what you can handle, okay come grab it\n\nHere go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage\n\nFiends had me Blade dancing, eating sixty dollar salads\n\nGet it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge\n\nMy first offer was 30 years, not a day lower\n\nI told them crackers holler at me when they sober\n\nOn parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?\n\nYeah you right, bro take his head off his fucking shoulders (boom boom boom!)\n\nYou hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on\n\nWhat was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio\n\nYou hear me? aye I heard I had some sneak dissers\n\nWhoever feeling hot, that AR got a heat sensor\n\nCuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas\n\nI wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas\n\nDon't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas\n\nAnd tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga\n\nI don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?\n\nThrough these white buffs I can see the hoe in niggas\n\nFree my nigga Parico, that boy be hoeing niggas\n\nShoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas\n\nBoy I can't trust you with that strap if you don't got no bodies\n\nBoy I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody\n\nYou ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly\n\nI came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari\n\nThirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was coming home\n\nShout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cumming on\n\nGet em to the crib, bust em down, now bitch run along\n\nThis SK'll get to shaking like there's something wrong\n\nThirty bands two times, watch this money clone\n\nThe feds say my name hot like when the oven on\n\nBitch I came home to my lil brother gone\n\nNiggas say they looking for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone\n\nWho said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him\n\nBetter check the black and white, that paperwork will vouch for him\n\nZero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him\n\nHe don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him\n\nI ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on\n\nSo soon as I'm done fucking, put your shoes on\n\nI'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong\n\nThe feds trying to build a case, I can't move wrong\n\nI went to trial back to back, bitch I'm two and oh\n\nThe state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store\n\nSay I can't even be in public with my hoodie on\n\nMichigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on\n\n\n\nI know they prayed on my downfall\n\nI know they prayed on my downfall\n\nOn all ten bitch I stood tall\n\nShow these disloyal niggas how to ball",
