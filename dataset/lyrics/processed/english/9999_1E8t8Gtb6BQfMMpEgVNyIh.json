  "lyrics": "Sometimes I don't know what to say\r\nSo much you're at a loss for words\r\nSometimes you tell me I'm alright\r\nI barely think that I concur\r\nAnd all of my friends have lost their light like c-c-c-cataracts\r\nAnd I believe that if I chase something\n\nI'll end up with what I deserve\n\nThere's many many things that can you can do, yeah\n\nThere's many many places you could see, yeah\n\nBut you're stuck right here\n\nWaiting for the world to change your point of view\n\nI've been nothing but notes and strings for so long, so long\n\nI've heard nothing but my gramps telling me to go so far, so far\n\nOh feel it running in my hands and head\n\nFrom my toes up to my sore heart\n\nI've seen nothing but growth and everybody show love, so I show love\n\nSometimes I don't know if you're playing me, playing me\n\nYou sound rehearsed and when you talk it's like a play to me\n\nSay something real, don't make that face to me\n\nI said I'm into deep, it's not a phase to me\n\nAnd all of my friends have lost their light like cigarettes\n\nI believed that I make something new\n\nYouʼd love me for myself an everything I've been through\n\n‘Cause there's many many places you could be, yeah\n\nThere's many many faces you could see, yeah\n\nBut you're stuck right here\n\nWaiting for my words to change your point of view\n\nSo I said\n\nI've been nothing but notes and strings for so long, so long\n\nI've heard nothing but my gramps telling me to go so far, so far\n\nOh feel it running in my hands and head\n\nFrom my toes up to my sore heart\n\nI've seen nothing but growth and everybody show love, so I show love\n\nShow love, show love\n\n\n\nShow love, so I show love",
