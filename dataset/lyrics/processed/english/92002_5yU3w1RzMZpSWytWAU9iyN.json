  "lyrics": "Dear fear, I have met you\r\nLaying down in this bedroom\r\nI feel like I'm on Neptune\r\nOpen windows to breathe again\r\nThere's no way it's holy\r\nSo baby, just hold me\n\n'Til I turn back to the old me\n\nThere's some demons I need to cleanse\n\n\n\nWhy they got me here, why they got me here?\n\nWhen can I leave?\n\nIt's like I'm in Black Mirror, it's been the last five years\n\n\n\nWhy's my mind on autopilot all the time?\n\nI'm feeling like the world's back on rewind\n\nI can't seem to find the words to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this\n\nMy mind's on autopilot all the time\n\nMy window pane is as grey as the sky\n\nJust can't get one single word to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this, ayy\n\n\n\nOn myself, I am sleeping\n\nAll my thoughts are misleading\n\nThat shit gets my heart beating\n\nWay too fast, I'm needing\n\nSanity or some reason\n\nCan't blame this on the season\n\nRain or shine, I still feel them\n\nHold me back from freedom\n\n\n\nNow they got me here, now they got me here\n\nWhen can I leave?\n\nIt's like I'm in Black Mirror, it's been the last five years\n\n\n\nWhy's my mind on autopilot all the time?\n\nI'm feeling like the world's back on rewind\n\nI can't seem to find the words to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this\n\nMy mind's on autopilot all the time\n\nMy window pane is as grey as the sky\n\nJust can't get one single word to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this, ayy\n\n\n\nNow they got me here, now they got me here\n\nWhen can I leave?\n\nIt's like I'm in Black Mirror, it's been the last five years\n\n\n\nWhy's my mind on autopilot all the time?\n\nI'm feeling like the world's back on rewind\n\nI can't seem to find the words to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this\n\nMy mind's on autopilot all the time\n\nMy window pane is as grey as the sky\n\nJust can't get one single word to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this, ayy\n\n\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this\n\nMy mind's on autopilot all the time\n\nMy window pane is as grey as the sky\n\nJust can't get one single word to define\n\nThe way I feel when I go through this, ayy\n\n\n\nDear fear, I have met you\n\nLaying down in this bedroom",
