  "lyrics": "Cold late night, so long ago\r\nWhen I was not so strong, you know\r\nA pretty man came to me\r\nNever seen eyes so blue\r\nYou know I could not run away, it seemed\n\nWe'd seen each other in a dream\n\nSeemed like he knew me\n\nHe looked right through me, yeah\n\n\n\n\"Come on home, girl\", he said with a smile\n\n\"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile\n\nBut try to understand\n\nTry to understand\n\nTry, try, try to understand\n\nI'm a magic man\"\n\n\n\nWinter nights, we sang in tune\n\nPlayed inside the months of moon\n\nNever think of never\n\nLet this spell last forever\n\n\n\nWell, summer lover passed to fall\n\nTried to realize it all\n\nMama says she's worried\n\nGrowing up in a hurry, yeah\n\n\n\n\"Come on home, girl\", Mama cried on the phone\n\n\"Too soon to lose my baby yet, my girl should be at home\"\n\nBut try to understand\n\nTry to understand\n\nTry, try, try to understand\n\nHe's a magic man, Mama\n\nAh, he's a magic man\n\n\n\n\"Come on home, girl\", he said with a smile\n\n\"I cast my spell of love on you, a woman from a child\"\n\nBut try to understand\n\nTry to understand\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nTry, try to understand\n\nTry, try, try to understand\n\nHe's a magic man, oh yeah\n\nOoh, he got the magic hands\n\n\n\n\"Come on home, girl\", he said with a smile\n\n\"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile\"\n\nBut try to understand\n\nTry to understand\n\nTry, try, try to understand\n\nHe's a magic man\n\nYeah, oh",
