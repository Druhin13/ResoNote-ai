  "lyrics": "There's this image of you that I can't shake\r\nThat day we drove out to the ocean\r\nSo many things I wanted to say\r\nBut I knew it, it was all in vain\r\nLife doesn't give you hoops to jump through\n\nIt gives you tireless roads to cross\n\nThis sadness came over me\n\nSo in love, so at a loss\n\n\n\nI've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\n\n\nI've been feeling there's no in between for us\n\nSadness stuck in the road\n\nEven when I'm as high as I can get\n\nI can't forget I'm on my own\n\n\n\nKeep thinkin' I can escape this\n\nBut there are no red shoes to tap\n\nJust endless crawling through a desert\n\nAnd babe there never was a map\n\n\n\nBut I've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\nOhh, ohhh\n\nOhh, ohhh\n\n\n\nAll the people I have grown to love\n\nThat I've had to leave behind\n\nBecause that was the way the road turned\n\nI'm sorry I have let you down\n\n\n\nYou caught me in a moment\n\nWhen I was trying to catch the wind\n\nThought there was some kind of magic\n\nIt's just we've executed tricks\n\n\n\nBut I've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\n\n\nThis is what time does to us\n\nWe try to fight and never win\n\nThere's no plot to follow here\n\nJust repetition of the same old sin\n\n\n\nI keep thinking that I've found it\n\nA way to fill up the empty parts in me\n\nIf it's all temporary\n\nI guess I'll have to wait and see\n\n\n\nI've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\nOhh, ohhh\n\nOhh, ohh\n\n\n\nThe woman who lives above me\n\nI hear her listen to the radio\n\nShe loves the old time stations\n\nThey say \"Lover don't let me go\"\n\n\n\nAnd I have been there before\n\nIn that place of desperate need\n\nI'm not ready to go back there\n\nTo wait for someone else to leave\n\n\n\nBut I've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\n\n\nNow I'm turnin' all my lights out\n\nI don't know where you are tonight\n\nCan feel so close and yet so far away\n\nAnd in the blinking if an eye\n\n\n\nI convince myself I have answers\n\nBut I always call my bluff\n\nAll I have is my love to give\n\nSome day that might be enough\n\n\n\nAnd I've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\nI've wanted you\n\nFor so very long\n\nOhh, ohhh, ohh, ohhh\n\nOhh, ohhh, ohh, ohhh",
