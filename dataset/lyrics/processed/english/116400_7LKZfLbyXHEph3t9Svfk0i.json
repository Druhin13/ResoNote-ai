  "lyrics": "It's hard for me to say this without sounding impatient\r\nAnd I know you know\r\nYou know how we can fix it\r\nJust tell me and I’ll listen, seems easy to me\r\nInstead, I'm tryna pick up on the signs\r\nRead between your lines\n\nTo see what's going on\n\n’Cause it's weighing us down\n\n\n\nRight now, you seem unhappy\n\nCan't we just talk it out before I go?\n\nInstead, you wanna wait until I'm coming home\n\nOh, I know that you won't let it go\n\n\n\nLet's solve this situation with simple conversation\n\nBefore it grows, grows\n\nGrows into something bigger\n\nLet's see the bigger picture and let it go\n\nFirst, let's try to talk about what went wrong\n\nThen talk about moving on\n\nWe both feel better off\n\nWhen we smile before I leave\n\n\n\nSo when you seem unhappy\n\nCan’t we just talk it out before I go?\n\nInstead, you wanna wait until I’m coming home\n\nOh, I know that you won't let it go\n\n\n\nI’ve been wrong (I've been wrong), I've been right (I've been right)\n\nBut we’re both gonna lose if we fight (If we fight)\n\nI'm still yours (I'm still yours), you're still mine (You're still mine)\n\nIf we fight, let me fight as the one by your side\n\n\n\nAnd if you seem unhappy\n\nCan't we just talk it out before I go? (Can't we talk it out?)\n\nInstead, you wanna wait until I'm coming home\n\nOh, I know that you won't let it go\n\nYou seem unhappy\n\nCan't we just talk it out before I go?\n\nInstead, you wanna wait until I'm coming home\n\nOh, I know that you won't let it go",
