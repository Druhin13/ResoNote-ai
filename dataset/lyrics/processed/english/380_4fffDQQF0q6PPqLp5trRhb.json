  "lyrics": "[Chorus: x2]\r\nAll your secrets stay safe\r\nAll your liars will lay\r\nAll your stories are staged\r\nOn that mattress\n\nAin't no way to ignore yourself\n\nA lot to say, no one to tell\n\nWe all think that you're so cool cause nobody knows that nobody knows you\n\nPaint brush color up them flaws\n\nBreak up send them broken laws\n\nYou can't share all the facts with a home made crosshair on your back\n\nEverybody wanna tell the tale\n\nLike the chips might fall but they never fail\n\nYou still don't realize, take a look around\n\nDo we seem surprised\n\nSo we don't even need to know\n\nAbout the poor decisions that feed your growth\n\nNah, we just wanna see the now what\n\nCan you keep a secret, can you keep your mouth shut\n\n\n\n[Chorus: x2]\n\n\n\nYou can't even tell your mirror\n\nAnyone can seem so sincere\n\nWatch whatever you volunteer\n\nVoices argue all over here\n\nShe was pointing at a hand\n\nWhen she said let's move this ball to the bed\n\nFirst time on the field hit a homerun\n\nWash your hands, don't tell no one\n\nBetter check yourself\n\nCause the best part of you the part kept to self\n\nWill never forget how it felt\n\nLook at how well you dealt with the guilt now\n\n\n\n[Chorus 2X]\n\n\n\nYou gotta secret but everybody does\n\nAnd the whole damn courtroom wanna be the judge\n\nYou don't wanna be distracted\n\nAnd take our minds off our own malpractice\n\nEverybody talk about their past\n\nLike today's mistake is gonna be the last\n\nWe wanna see behind your mask\n\nLike we ain't got our backyard to trash\n\nWell this one drink and drive\n\nAnd that one there, she [?] wife\n\nBroken promises, deadbeat dads\n\nOverdoses, and one night stands\n\nLet's all make a mess\n\nAnd try to project some kind of perfection\n\nAnd let me sing you a song\n\nCause I ain't the first thing you ever did wrong",
