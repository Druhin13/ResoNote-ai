  "lyrics": "I'm caught in the shadows, the American South\r\nSomewhere between hypocrite and hallelujah\r\nSix generations of barely gettin' by\r\nSix generations of hate, what's it to ya?\r\nWhen the only thing harder than the work is the luck\r\nThe outcome's as hopeful as the evenin' news\n\nAnd last November I saw firsthand\n\nWhat desperation makes good people do\n\n\n\nLife ain't fair\n\nSaddle up, boy, and see it through\n\nTough times don't last\n\nTough folks do\n\n\n\nSee I come from a long line of Carolina farmers\n\nFor years, tobacco was the answer\n\nIt kept the lights on and put food on the table\n\n'Til the doctors started callin' it cancer\n\nSo we took to the hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains\n\nWith a harvest of corn and some copper line\n\nAnd we found you can get a little slice of heaven\n\nWith some sugar yeast water and a whole lotta time\n\n\n\nLife ain't fair\n\nSaddle up, boy, and see it through\n\nTough times don't last\n\nBut tough folks do\n\n\n\nWhere I'm from a man's only worth the weight of his word and\n\nRespect ain't handed out, it's earned\n\nI've been runnin' with my back to the wall for seventeen years now\n\nAnd if it's one thing that I've learned, it's ...\n\n\n\nLife ain't fair\n\nSaddle up, boy, and see it through\n\nTough times don't last\n\nBut tough folks do\n\n\n\nLife ain't fair\n\nSaddle up, saddle up\n\nLife ain't fair\n\nSaddle up, saddle up\n\nLife ain't fair\n\nSaddle up, boy, and see it through\n\nTough times don't last\n\nBut tough folks do\n\nTough times don't last\n\nBut tough folks do",
