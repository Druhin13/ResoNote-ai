  "lyrics": "I love for sure how you look, yeah\nI'll run the way to the sky, oh\nI'm never coming down\n\nTryna keep my cool, neck full of jewels\nBeen grinding twenty years like a damn fool\n\nEverything I own I done worked for\n\nNo kids, no wife, no child support\n\nYou think this life is luck? No shortcuts\n\nIf I could I'd live my life inside a tour bus\n\nI could remember being 19, nice dreams\n\nNightmares, crystal stares, they don't like me\n\nFlashback '94 Honda Hatchback\n\nHad to pull these streets away from the club cause the windshield cracked\n\nFast throttle, 'course I drive the black Porsche\n\nEverything inside my closet I done paid for\n\n\n\nYou say that I'm not the one\n\nThat I can't stunt\n\nThat I didn't grind\n\nAlways wanna stunt my shine\n\nI ain't feeling fine\n\nNeed me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down, baby\n\n\n\nYou say that I'm not the one\n\nThat I can't stunt\n\nThat I didn't grind\n\nAlways wanna stunt my shine\n\nI ain't feeling fine\n\nNeed me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down, baby\n\n\n\nI love for sure how you look, yeah\n\nI'll run the way to the sky, oh\n\nI'm never coming down\n\n\n\nYeah, glacier berry watch, got time froze\n\nI done, I done shook dice with Pete Rose\n\nCrew cut, top peeled back like a nice orange\n\nI used to shoot jumpers with precise form\n\nThey wanna tell you what you can't do based on former facts\n\nIf I wanted to hear that bullshit I'd be in history class\n\nIf I'd have been around you five minutes I'd need a six pack\n\nIf I would've listened to your bitch ass I wouldn't be Riff Raff\n\n\n\nYou say that I'm not the one\n\nThat I can't stunt\n\nThat I didn't grind\n\nAlways wanna stunt my shine\n\nI ain't feeling fine\n\nNeed me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down, baby\n\n\n\nYou say that I'm not the one\n\nThat I can't stunt\n\nThat I didn't grind\n\nAlways wanna stunt my shine\n\nI ain't feeling fine\n\nNeed me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down, baby\n\n\n\nI love for sure how you look, yeah\n\nI'll run the way to the sky, oh\n\nI'm never coming down",
