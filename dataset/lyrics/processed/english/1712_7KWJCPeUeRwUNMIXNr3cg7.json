  "lyrics": "Once upon your favorite dream\r\nThings were different but familiar\r\nStraw was stickin' out your seat\r\nEverything was technicolor\r\nIsn't it sad to be back in black-and-white?\r\nNo yellow road, no witch to fight?\n\nToo bad there's no place like home\n\n\n\nYou ain't dead yet\n\nTwenty-seven came and went\n\nNow you live to fight another day\n\nAs the hero of the carpool lane\n\nDay by day, if the posted limit you obey\n\nThen the biggest shot in your life\n\nWill be dressed with salt and lime\n\n\n\nOnce upon a terrible dream\n\nYou couldn't move a muscle\n\nCan't even pick an apple off of a tree\n\nWithout gettin' into trouble\n\nIsn't it good to be back in black-and-white?\n\nNo yellow road, no witch inside?\n\nThank God there's no place like home\n\n\n\nScarcrow ain't got nothin' on me\n\nI'm thinkin', I'm blinkin', I'm blinkin' today\n\nThe lie never was cowardly\n\n'Cause I'm shrinkin', I'm shrinkin', I'm shrinkin' away\n\nThe tin man ain't got nothin' on you\n\nYour heart is beatin', beatin' 'cause...\n\n\n\nYou ain't dead yet\n\nTwenty-seven came and went\n\nNow you live to fight another day\n\nAs the hero of the carpool lane\n\nDay by day, if the posted limit you obey\n\nThen the biggest shot in your life\n\nWill come dressed with salt and lime",
