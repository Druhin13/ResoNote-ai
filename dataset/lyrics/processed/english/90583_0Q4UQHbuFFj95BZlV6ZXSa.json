  "lyrics": "Waiter send this to the table, the party of one\r\nThe only other lonely soul in this place\r\nAnd so you're finishing up your coffee\r\nBut then where you're gonna run?\r\nWhere'd you get that look on your face?\n\nYou should always let the sun go down on your anger\n\nLet it burn you to sleep\n\nBring it closer to danger\n\nTo surrender and retreat\n\nSing your sad soul to sleep\n\n\n\nI loved you the first time I saw you\n\nAnd you know I love you still\n\nBut I am tired\n\nAnd I am yours\n\n\n\nDon't even think about your freedom\n\nOr taking that flight\n\nOr going back upon your promise after fighting for the right\n\nBecause your eggshells and your right statements and your weaponized words\n\nAre paper tigers now\n\n\n\nOh your constant overthinking and your secretive drinking\n\nAre making you more and more alone\n\nAnd girl, you can slam the door behind you\n\nIt ain't ever gonna close\n\nBecause when you're home, you're already home\n\n\n\nI am tired\n\nI am tired\n\nI don't wanna go home anymore\n\nI don't wanna throw stones anymore\n\nI don't wanna take part in the war\n\n\n\nI loved you the first time I saw you\n\nAnd you know I love you still\n\nI loved you the first time I saw you\n\nAnd you know I love you still\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be right anymore\n\nLord, I don't wanna fight anymore\n\nI'm not taking your side anymore\n\nI am tired\n\nI am not my own\n\nAnd I am leaving\n\nOh, I am tired\n\nAnd I'm coming home\n\n\n\n'Cause I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours\n\nI am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours, I am yours",
