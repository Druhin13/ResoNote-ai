  "lyrics": "Started with phone conversations and I\r\nFlew out to see you, it's raining outside\r\nWe sat by the water and talking about life\r\nOh\r\nSaid you lost your dad, girl I know how that feels\r\nI lost my mom, tryna deal with that still\n\nI guess we connect on our hatred for pills\n\nIt's real\n\n\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\n\n\nYou got me thinking things I never used to\n\nI'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you\n\nSometimes I hold back from saying, \"I miss you\"\n\nBut I miss you\n\nI have to admit, on this road I get lonely\n\nBut you make me smile every time that you call me\n\nYou let me be myself\n\nYou don't control me\n\n\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\n\n\nLaying in my bed, I'm just staring at the ceiling, baby\n\nI just wanna know if you feel what I'm feeling, baby\n\nGot you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately\n\nYeah, deal is lately, deal is lately\n\nI'm a man of my word, girl believe that\n\nI'm a closed book but somehow you learn to read that\n\nKnow that I should relax, hate the way I react\n\nThinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse\n\nThinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse\n\nGirl wake up let's go, all I can think of is you\n\n\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind\n\nI got you on my mind, baby\n\nI got you on my mind, I got you on my mind",
