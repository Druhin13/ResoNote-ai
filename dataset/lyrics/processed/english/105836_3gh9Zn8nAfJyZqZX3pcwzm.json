  "lyrics": "They found him in the gutter of the business end of another friday night\r\nSomeone had clearly been there before I didn't feel I had to ask him why\r\nI have never understood why we need to know the reasons for everyone else’s strides\r\nSometimes you don't need sympathy to get the words right\r\nCaught in anguish\r\nHe was\n\nSometimes that's enough\n\nFor he was singing\n\n\n\nOh looks like the end again\n\nHer body bleaching out into the waves\n\nIt’s still the loudest thing\n\nOh I wish I had all my friends somewhere drinking\n\nThe sunny afternoon into oblivion\n\nBut that's not your fault\n\nHow could that be my fault?\n\n\n\nSo we walked into a house party of someone, someone somehow knew all about\n\nAnd all the young girls turned up late and drank us all to some kind of stand still\n\nWith looks averted all before and distant ideas of death and thrills\n\nAnd in absence asks the host if he had any left\n\nAnd somehow I did feel like yesterday was ours\n\nBut it's gone\n\nYesterday was ours\n\nAll along\n\nAnd they were singing\n\n\n\nOh looks like the end again\n\nHer body bleaching out into the waves\n\nIts still the loudest thing\n\nOh I wish I had all my friends\n\nOut there drinking the sunny afternoon into oblivion\n\nBut that's not your fault\n\nHow could that be your fault?",
