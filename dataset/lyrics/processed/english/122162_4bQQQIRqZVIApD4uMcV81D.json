  "lyrics": "Do I love you too much?\r\nDo I hold you too tight?\r\nHave you had enough?\r\nShake me off in the night\r\nIf I had a gun\n\nIf I had a knife\n\nIf I had your love\n\nIf I was your wife\n\n\n\nIf I go on my own\n\nAnd I see you in my dreams\n\nAnd I hope to again\n\nI have silently schemed\n\n\n\nIf I had a gun\n\nIf I had a knife\n\nIf I was the one\n\nIf I was your wife",
