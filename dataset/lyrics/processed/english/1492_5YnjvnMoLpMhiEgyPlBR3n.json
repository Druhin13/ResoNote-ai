  "lyrics": "Relax\r\nI know you've never been this high before\r\nThe stars, the moons and the constellations\r\nLet's leave this world and take a trip\r\nDon't let anybody say you're wrong for taking a lift\n\nFly with Me\n\nWe can't look back let's all just drift away\n\nCome fly with me\n\nSafe from the storm the galaxy's where we'll stay\n\nFly With Me\n\n\n\nWe're on that coaster now\n\nOh it's such a feeling\n\nLetting go somehow\n\nSimultaneous being\n\nWe're light miles from where we used to be\n\nFeeling supernatural\n\nLight from the quasars leads us to our next destination\n\nEyes closed as we drift off in meditation\n\nWe're way out past intergalactic\n\nAnd I don't think we're coming back\n\n\n\nFly with Me\n\nWe can't look back let's all just drift away\n\nCome fly with me\n\nSafe from the storm the galaxy's where we'll stay\n\nFly With Me",
