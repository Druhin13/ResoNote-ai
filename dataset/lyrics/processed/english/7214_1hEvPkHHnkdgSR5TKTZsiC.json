  "lyrics": "Tokyo, oh tokyo\r\nI'm aware of your deadly present\r\nI see you've come with the presents\r\nAnd brought along your mother too\r\nTokyo, oh tokyo\n\nI'm afraid of what's going to happen\n\nWhen every bedroom flattens\n\nAnd everything falls in the sea\n\n\n\nTokyo, oh tokyo\n\nYou're too tall of a truth to take in\n\nSince we're grounded in a day-dream\n\nCan't wait till we meet up again",
