  "lyrics": "I know you better than you think I do\r\nYou coulda stuck with me\r\nBut I guess a girl's gotta do what she has to\r\nEvery now and then, my name passes your lips\r\nYour late night stroll down a memory lane\r\nOn your, your finger tips\n\n\n\nDo you miss me so much?\n\n\n\nFeeling like I hypnotised you\n\nFeel a burning deep inside you\n\nThe only thing that satisfies\n\nYou miss me so much\n\nAnd now you're burning with that old flame\n\nYearning for my old game\n\nYou tremble when you hear my name\n\nYou miss me so much\n\nWell, that's too bad\n\n\n\nAnd we go together like a hand and gun\n\nSqueeze off a couple rounds\n\nPut me away 'til next time you wanna hurt someone\n\nEvery now and then, you like to empty your clip, no no\n\nThen I go right under your belt on your hip\n\n\n\nDo you miss me so much?\n\n\n\nFeeling like I hypnotised you\n\nFeel a burning deep inside you\n\nThe only thing that satisfies\n\nYou miss me so much\n\nAnd now you're burning with that old flame\n\nYearning for my old game\n\nYou tremble when you hear my name\n\nYou miss me so much\n\nWell, that's too bad, too bad, too bad\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling like I hypnotised you\n\nFeel a burning deep inside you\n\nThe only thing that satisfies\n\nYou miss me so much\n\nAnd now you're burning with that old flame\n\nYearning for my old game\n\nYou tremble when you hear my name\n\nYou miss me so much, so much\n\nAnd you miss me\n\nWell, that's too bad",
