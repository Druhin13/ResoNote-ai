  "lyrics": "I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there\r\nShe was stretched out on a long white table,\r\nSo cool, so sweet and so fair\r\nLet her go, let her go, God bless her\r\nWherever she may be\n\nShe may search this whole wide world over\n\nNever find a sweeter man as me\n\n\n\nWhen I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat\n\nPut a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain\n\nThe gang'll know I died standing pat\n\n\n\nLet her go, let her go God bless her\n\nWherever she may be\n\nShe may search this wide world over\n\nNever find a sweeter man as me\n\n\n\nI want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers\n\nThree pretty women to sing a song\n\nStick a jazz band on my hearse wagon\n\nRaise hell as I stroll along\n\n\n\nLet her go Let her go\n\nGod bless her\n\nWherever she may be\n\nShe may search this whole wide\n\nWorld over\n\nShe'll never find a sweeter\n\nMan as me",
