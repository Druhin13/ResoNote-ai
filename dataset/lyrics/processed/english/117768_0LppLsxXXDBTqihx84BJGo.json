Uh\n\nTen toes, know you on your shit already\n\nBig stone, granite in your fist, ball\n\nStanding on the strip\n\nDon't panic when the pig come\n\nScramble, get the big tall fetti, and then get home\n\nTally up the wins though\n\nDon't think he said he pro-violence\n\nBut it's gon' be your problem if he did though\n\nI lived out the way, ay\n\nPalace where the Crips stay\n\nSilent when the pigs came browsing in his shit\n\nBang like two mallets, too callous for your bitch taste\n\n'Member when they had my grandmammy on a drip drink\n\nHow much of that gin straight? Could have filled a fish tank\n\nMy doggy hit my cell, say he got me off the strength\n\nAsk him, \"That's just how it is?\" say\n\n\"You die and then you live, huh?\"\n\nYour heart and then your limbs break\n\nJust catch me when I slip, bro\n\nWhat's popping like a hip bone\n\nI told you\n\nThese niggas passing, like the Citgo we passing\n\nNiggas know we keep the gas inside the spliff roll\n\nThe wind get the ashes in the end bro\n\nWe been took your pass and your credentials, uh\n\nBad apple, daily clashing with my kinfolk\n\nBad acid did damage to my mental\n\nShorty right, it took some passages to get grown\n\nThey been called me savage from the get go\n\nUh",
