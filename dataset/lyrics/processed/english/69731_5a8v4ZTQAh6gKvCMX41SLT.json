  "lyrics": "Here he comes again, my old foe. No, no, no. I could not keep him in his hole. No, no, no. Itâ€™s one, two, three, but never four. No, no, no. Then repeat it again, forevermore. Forevermore. He gnaws away my control. He gnaws away my control. His toothless gums gnaw to my soul. Then, he cackles all the way back to his home. Chaotic nightmares behind my eyes. Why, why, why? They tangle, they tear, they twist-up my mind. Why, why, why? Where devils, and demons, and hells collide. Why, why, why? A fragile smile says everything's fine. Everything's fine. He gnaws away my control. He gnaws away my control. His toothless gums gnaw to my soul. Then, he cackles all the way back to his home. He gnaws away my control. He gnaws away my control. His toothless gums gnaw to my soul. Then, he cackles all the way back to his home.",
