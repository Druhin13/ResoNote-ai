  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Tax Time par DaBaby\r\nI fuck ya bitch better when it's tax time\nTryna get up in them pants, 'cause I really need a bag, ion really mean to brag\nI ain't seen a nigga yet, that can run in wit ya boy\nI'm walkin' round the house without a shirt like uncle Roy\nI sent my uncle Rick to get some liquor from the store\nI need to hit the nursing home to see my uncle Ray\nSupposed to go and see my momma but I went and made a play\nI ain't nothing like the muhfuckin' niggas round the way, I'm the muhfuckin' truth\nEverything I muhfuckin' do\n\nI asked him what he paid the nigga said 25, should've seen the nigga eyes when I told him 22\nLike the other nigga face when I hit 'em for the 20\nYou know everybody 'round me getting muhfuckin' money\nI ain't forget to pray but I ain't go to church on Sunday\nI was selling pounds tryna break 'em down to onions (God damn there he go)\nThese niggas hate it when they see me on the radio, they even played a nigga on the TV\nThese niggas late, I told these niggas I was great they ain't believe me\nI hit the crowd the people squeeze me they be screamin' Baby Jesus\nFucked around and made a 20 yesterday from sellin' reefer\n\nMade another 45 hunnid doin' niggas features\nImma turn a 25 to a 50, double that and bring it back to the family everybody round me eatin'\nAnd if I'm on the stage and nigga in the crowd play crazy we gon' jump up off the stage we gon' beat him\nI cut a couple side hoes off, cause I don't got the time of the day for them bitches I don't need 'em\nAll the labels lookin' at me cut the muhfuckin' check\n'Cause I ain't seen a rapper out here fuckin' with me yet\nI'm holding up a rollie on my muhfuckin' wrist\nAnd I'm dancin' round with diamonds on my muhfuckin' neck\nFuckin' on her good like I'm tryna break a sweat\nI just hopped up off a flight, flew to Charlotte overnight\n\nI don't wanna be killer, I don't think you wanna die\nThat's a muhfuckin' 40, put it in a nigga life\nWhat the fuck a nigga mean, fuck is on a nigga mind\nWhy he wanna fuck with me? I was out here doing fine\nBook the show and pay the fee I'ma turn up every time\nI'm too busy on the grind, don't try now to hit my line",
