  "lyrics": "Bursting with empathy, I'm feeling everything\r\nThe weight of the world on my shoulders\r\nHope my tears don't freak you out\r\nThey're just kinda coming out\r\nIt's the music in me and all of the colors\n\nWish we didn't live, wish we didn't live so far from each other\n\nI'm just sitting here thinking 'bout the time that's slipping\n\nAnd missing my mother, mother\n\nAnd she's probably sitting there\n\nThinking 'bout the time that's slipping\n\nAnd missing her mother, mother",
