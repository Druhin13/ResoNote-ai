  "lyrics": "You said \"Don't go changing\r\nI'll rearrange to let you in\r\nAnd I'll be your historian\r\nAnd you'll be mine\r\nAnd I'll fill pages of scribbled ink\r\nHoping the words carry meaning\"\n\n\n\nThen one day, the motorcade\n\nCovered in flower wreaths\n\nFirst in a big parade\n\nWill come to take one of us away\n\nLeaving the other with plenty to read\n\n\n\nThis is what I want to talk about\n\nBut somehow the words will not leave my mouth\n\nWas I most complete at the beginning? Or the bow?\n\nIf past you were to meet future me\n\nWould you be holding me here and now?",
