  "lyrics": "Hello everybody, I'm here to ruin your party\r\nClumsy with words around the people I don't know\r\nAnd I'll be stumbling with what to say like everywhere I go\r\nBut I promise I'm not like this all the time\r\nYeah, I can spit game when I'm online\n\nWhen I got a keyboard I can hide behind\n\nPut careful thought into every single word I type\n\nBut when I see you face to face\n\nDon't know how to talk or what to say\n\n'Cause there's no rewind button and there's no erase\n\nYou seem concerned by my lack of words\n\nAnd I don't hate you, I'm just preserved\n\n\n\nSelf-conscious, social skills aren't making any progress\n\nI might seem like an asshole\n\nBut I'm totally harmless, truthfully I'm just\n\n\n\nSocially awkward\n\nNot a smooth talker\n\nBut once you get to know me\n\nI've got so much more to offer\n\nWhen I'm face to face with you\n\nDon't know what to say or do\n\nHard for me to play it cool\n\nAwkward\n\n\n\nYou know how I do it when I'm feeling kinda awkward\n\nI pour myself some liquor and I let it do the talking\n\nI probably shouldn't do that but I guess I got some problems\n\nUm, I'm too afraid to come up to you when I see you at a party\n\nSo I slide up in your DMs just to tell you that I saw you, oh\n\nNo-one likes rejection\n\nOur screens are all protection\n\nNo feelings are detected when the words are only texted\n\n\n\nI might seem like an asshole\n\nBut I'm totally harmless, truthfully I'm just\n\n\n\nSocially awkward\n\nNot a smooth talker\n\nBut once you get to know me\n\nI've got so much more to offer\n\nWhen I'm face to face with you\n\nDon't know what to say or do\n\nHard for me to play it cool\n\n\n\nSocially awkward\n\nNot a smooth talker\n\nBut once you get to know me\n\nI've got so much more to offer\n\nWhen I'm face to face with you\n\nDon't know what to say or do\n\nHard for me to play it cool\n\n\n\nSee, okay, yeah, I'm not good at talking to people\n\nI guess I'm not good at singing either\n\n(Hard for me to play it cool)",
