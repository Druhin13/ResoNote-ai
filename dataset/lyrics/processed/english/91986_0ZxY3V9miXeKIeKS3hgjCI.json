Will we go out stars?\n\nThat's the greatest, in the latest\n\nThis a drop top foreign, yeah a Mercedes\n\nShe said that she like my eyes, wanna have my baby\n\nBut shorty I can't have ties with you, my lady\n\nI'm seein' things different, the vision gettin' clearer\n\nI'm tired of havin' battles with the man in the mirror\n\nI'm prayin' every night, tryna stay in good spirit\n\nI'm only bein' me, I'm not tryna be different\n\nSet a good example for the world and the children\n\nThey didn't let us in, now we runnin' the whole building\n\nHaters see me win, now they mad and in their feelings\n\nAge of 19 when I touched my first million\n\nI can't explain to you how it feels\n\nAnd they talk down on me and all my skills\n\nThey gon' throw shade on you when you real\n\nWell, I mean\n\n\n\nJust lately I've been a mess\n\nI really think that I'm depressed\n\nYou try to tell me not to worry\n\nWhen you knowin' I be stressed\n\nI looked on the bright side just to see you love me less\n\nWhen I was down and had nobody\n\nYou was the only one I'd text, I know\n\nIt's hard livin' life on your own\n\nI'm on the road and I just gotta go\n\nI'm really stuck in my zone\n\nWorkin' hard, barely keepin' control\n\nThrough this life, see it's highs and it's lows\n\nYou didn't want me to grow\n\n\n\nSo I just let you go\n\nDamn\n\nYou didn't want me to grow, no",
