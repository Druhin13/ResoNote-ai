  "lyrics": "What madness stirs in the depths of the dark?\r\nEver so near...\r\nLike forlorn beasts of prey stalking their captor\r\nUnholy revenants\r\nManifestation of the curse that gnaws\r\nLike shards in the folds of flesh\n\n\n\nSanctity begotten in damnations womb\n\nAbominations in the presence of whom\n\nThe fertile seeds of iniquity deep in the heart\n\nBegin to germinate and take form\n\n\n\nEyes for teeth and teeth for eyes\n\nTeeth that see and eyes that bite\n\nThrough the gates of the night\n\n\n\nWild and free - The Power\n\nPandemoniac\n\n\n\nTheir trail is marked by a residue of nameless rage\n\nAnd the severed hands of the thieves that sway\n\nIn winds that howl forevermore through the abyss\n\nAnd rise at will\n\nUp from the Netherworld",
