Oh!\n\n\n\nWish I could let my brain\n\nDecide and stop the pain\n\nI keep heart-shaped glasses close to me\n\nFor when it rains (life in pink)\n\nRip it up and start again\n\nBut I'm loving you the same\n\nI keep heart-shaped glasses close to me\n\nFor when it rains (life in pink)\n\n\n\nLife in pink\n\nLife in pink\n\n\n\nMy bedroom is a mess but I just can't clean it\n\nYeah I'm hungry but I don't even feel like eating\n\nYeah I'm trying\n\nI'm not lying\n\n\n\nWhen you're in my head\n\nWell I wish it was someone else\n\nMad at me again\n\nAnd that's not even what I said!\n\nWhat's wrong with me?\n\nAm I a person yet?\n\nWhat's wrong with me?
