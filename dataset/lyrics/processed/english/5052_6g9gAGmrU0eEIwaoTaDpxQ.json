  "lyrics": "It's underneath my skin\r\nThese god forsaken memories\r\nThe puppet takes the stage, he'll carry on\r\nForgotten who I am\r\nBut all the world keeps telling me\r\nIt may be where you live but it's not your home\n\n\n\nI got a one way ticket straight outta here\n\nAnd I don't know where it goes\n\nIt's not the destination, it's the crawl\n\nWas it out of love, or out of fear?\n\nIf you ask me, I don't know\n\nYou forget how to want, once you've had it all\n\n\n\nYou can take me anywhere\n\nYou can take me anywhere\n\nI got a way back home and an open door\n\nTo everything I left, face-down on the floor\n\nYou know you can take me anywhere\n\n\n\nIt's underneath my skin\n\nLike ink that's still reminding me\n\nA night where everything's not as it seems\n\nA thousand widened smiles\n\nBut none contain no empathy\n\nPaper thin, to see right through me\n\n\n\nI got a one way ticket straight outta here\n\nAnd I don't know where it goes\n\nIgnore the rise but everyone sees you fall\n\nWas it out of love, or out of fear?\n\nIf you ask me, I don't know\n\nYou forget how to want, once you've had it all\n\n\n\nYou can take me anywhere\n\nYou can take me anywhere\n\nI got a way back home and an open door\n\nTo everything I left, face-down on the floor\n\nYou know you can take me anywhere\n\n\n\nIt's easy to see it\n\nTo wanna believe it\n\nBut once in a while\n\nYou've just got to come clean\n\nNow you're trying to hide it\n\nBut you can't deny it\n\nIt's falling apart, tearing up at the seams\n\nI gave it my best\n\nSecretly I'm a mess\n\nBut sooner or later\n\nIt's bound to rise\n\nSo many warnings\n\nThat I've been ignoring\n\nNow it's shutting down\n\n\n\nYou can take me anywhere\n\nYou can take me anywhere\n\nI got a way back home and an open door\n\nTo everything I left, face-down on the floor\n\nYou know you can take me anywhere\n\n\n\nYou can take me anywhere (Take me anywhere)\n\nYou can take me anywhere (Take me anywhere)\n\nI got a way back home and an open door\n\nTo everything I left, face-down on the floor\n\nYou know you can take me anywhere\n\nTake me anywhere",
