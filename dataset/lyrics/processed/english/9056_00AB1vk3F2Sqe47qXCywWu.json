  "lyrics": "Stepping out, away from a burning heat\r\nThe water we drink has never tasted this sweet\r\nFevered devotion, deep as the ocean\r\nSaved us from what should have been\r\nCool winds will blow, we'll try to show how we feel\n\nIn your beat\n\nDancing with me\n\n\n\nOvercome, drowned by a deafening roar\n\nHeard it above, it's something we can't ignore\n\nNight is eroding, daylight has broken\n\nBathed in the light of the sun\n\nMelting away, we'll try to gauge how we feel\n\n\n\nIn your beat\n\nDancing with me\n\nIn your beat\n\nDancing with me\n\n\n\nWhy we gotta be so damn low?\n\nWhy we gotta be so damn low once again?\n\nWhy we gotta be so damn low?\n\nWhy we gotta be so damn low once again?\n\n\n\nIn your beat\n\nDancing with me\n\nIn your beat\n\nDancing with me",
