  "lyrics": "You found a carousel to ride around\r\nBut you get bored, so you tear it down\r\nLike a kid in a playground, putting sand in their mouth\r\nSpit it out, when you're feeling fickle\r\nAnd I want to say it shouldn't work that way\r\nPeople's lives ain't a game, just 'cause you can pay\n\nSmoking your big fat cigar\n\nTweed hat, cravat and four birds on your arm\n\n\n\nI'm just a tin pan boy, do you want to take that toy?\n\nHey, you, Mr. Developer\n\nHey, you, Mr. Developer\n\nYou're just a tin town toy, a big fat boy\n\nHey, you, Mr. Inheritor\n\nCrook, hook, Mr. Proprietor (boy)\n\n\n\nYou kick the small kid off the monkey bars\n\nTake your mess out of his specs and the size of his arm\n\nForce him to dress in black, then make him hold your holster\n\nWhilst you shoot him in the back (back)\n\nYou will say I'm only writing songs\n\nSon, get off of your ass and get a proper job\n\nAnd snigger at my beat-up boots\n\nBut I tell you, Sir, I'm coming after you in fiction\n\n\n\nI'm just a tin pan boy, please, don't take my toys\n\nHey, you, Mr. Developer\n\nHey, you, Mr. Developer\n\nYou're just a tin town toy, a big fat boy\n\nHey, you, Mr. Inheritor, hey, you Mr. Proprietor (boy)\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm just a tin pan boy, 'cause they take my toys\n\nHey, hey\n\nYou're just a tin town toy, a big fat boy\n\nHey, hey, boy",
