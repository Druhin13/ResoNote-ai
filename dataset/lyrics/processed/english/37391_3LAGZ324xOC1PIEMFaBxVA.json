Is this nigga taking a knee\r\nI hope she says yes\n\nBut there's just too much love in the air right now\n\nRight now bartender right now\n\nPo up a shot\n\nSo I could be gone\n\nSo I could leave here before the dj plays this song\n\nSo nobody else could wonder why the pretty girl's alone\n\n\n\nI hope you know\n\nThat when you ain't in love\n\nThis month could fucking suck\n\n\n\nNow let the Church say\n\nAhhhh, Amen\n\n\n\nLet the Church say\n\nAhhhh, Amen \n\nAhhhh, Amen\n\nAhhhh, Amen",
