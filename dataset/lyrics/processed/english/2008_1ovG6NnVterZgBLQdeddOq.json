  "lyrics": "Before the grief, I found peace in my selfish ways\r\nMy yesterdays were erased\r\nDeath will bring change\r\nBefore the crash, I revealed in potential untapped\r\nMortality was not contained\n\nDeath will bring change\n\n\n\nThe bottom of this well is rich with bitter water, it lays still, drowsy, dreaming, & dying to get out\n\n\n\nNow I’m anchored but my lines are all tangled\n\nCan’t afford to unwind\n\n\n\nBefore this wreck, I found peace in my health\n\nNow my insides rebel\n\nDeath will bring change",
