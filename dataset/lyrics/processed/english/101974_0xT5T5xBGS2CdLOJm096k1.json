  "lyrics": "Ooh, well, way up north where the air gets cold\r\nThere's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told\r\nAnd a real famous cat all dressed up in red\r\nAnd he spends a whole year working out on his sled\r\nIt's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick\n\nJust little bobsleigh, we call it old Saint Nick\n\nBut she sparks the buggy with a full speed stick\n\nShe's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel\n\nThen Santa gets the gas and just watch her peel, yeah\n\nIt's little Saint Nick, it's little Saint Nick\n\n\n\nRun, run reindeer, run, run reindeer\n\nRun, run reindeer, run, run reindeer\n\nRun, run, run, yeah\n\n\n\nHe's walking through the snow at a frightening speed\n\nWith the half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead\n\nHe's gotta wear his goggle 'cause the snow really flies\n\nAnd he's cruising every path with a little surprise\n\nIt's the little Saint Nick, it's the little Saint Nick\n\n\n\nOoh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick\n\nOoh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick\n\nOoh, Merry Christmas, Saint Nick",
