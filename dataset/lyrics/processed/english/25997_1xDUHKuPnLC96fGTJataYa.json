  "lyrics": "I, I was the lonely one\r\nWondering what went wrong\r\nWhy love had gone\r\nAnd left me lonely\r\nI, I was so confused\n\nFeeling like I'd just been used\n\nThen you came to me\n\nAnd my loneliness left me\n\n\n\nI use to think I was tied to a heartache\n\nThat was the heartbreak\n\nBut now that I've found you\n\n\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nNow that we're here together\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nSince I found you\n\nEven the days are brighter\n\nWhen someone you loves beside you\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nSince I found you\n\n\n\nYou, you knew just what to do\n\nCause you had been lonely too\n\nAnd you showed me how\n\nTo ease the pain\n\n\n\nAnd you did more\n\nThan mend a broken heart\n\nCause now you've made a fire start\n\nAnd I, I can see that you feel\n\nThe same way\n\nI never dream that someone will hold me\n\nUntil you told me\n\nBut now that I've found you\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nNow that we're here together\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nSince I found you\n\nEven the days are brighter\n\nWhen someone you loves beside you\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nSince I found you\n\n\n\nI never dream that someone will hold me\n\nUntil you told me\n\nBut now that I've found you\n\n\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nNow that we're here together\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nSince I found you\n\nEven the days are brighter\n\nWhen someone you loves beside you\n\nEven the nights are better\n\nSince I found you",
