  "lyrics": "After the storm breaks\r\nFluorescence radiates off\r\nSkin overflowing with underexposure\r\nThis was a shit day\r\nCan’t power through the haze\n\nI’m tired of waiting for it to be over\n\n\n\nLet’s go back to Melbourne\n\nWe can start over because\n\nMistakes get forgotten\n\nDreams can be remembered\n\n\n\nAfter your heart breaks\n\nEars ring and colors fade\n\nAnd everyone smiling feels like an intruder\n\n\n\nAnd you’re drawn\n\nTo the word that came out wrong\n\nAs if all along you weren’t ignoring the truth:\n\nYou’re a loser\n\n\n\nLet’s go back to Melbourne\n\nWe can start over because\n\nMistakes get forgotten\n\nDreams can be remembered\n\n\n\nSo go on\n\nListen to some stupid song\n\nAnd pretend to sing along\n\nAnd try remembering\n\nWhat I’d think was smart when I was young\n\nWhere my memory makes me strong\n\nBut the record shows me dumb\n\nAnd breaking everything\n\nOh, I paid the price for being wrong\n\nI’m alone in this mess and a blizzard’s coming on\n\nI’m alone in this mess and a blizzard’s coming on\n\n\n\nGo back to Melbourne\n\nWe can start over\n\nMistakes get forgotten\n\nDreams get remembered",
