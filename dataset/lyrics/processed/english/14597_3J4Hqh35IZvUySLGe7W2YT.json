  "lyrics": "It's tough, supporting what seems like fantasies\r\nClouds collapse your lungs\r\nThe bends have had their ways\r\nIt's rough, watching potential slip into the fray\r\nPerspective lost, spinning out\n\nWe're not boys just climbing trees\n\n\n\nYou say you're always living out your dreams\n\nYou're just sleeping\n\nCrooked floors should never stop your feet\n\nFrom moving\n\n\n\n(Hopeless)\n\n\n\nThey'll ask, \"Whatever happened to him anyway?\"\n\nWater in your chest\n\nDrown your cries again\n\nWe'll say, \"He was exactly who we thought he was\"\n\nPerspective lost, spinning out\n\nWe're all boys just losing years\n\n\n\nYou say you're always living out your dreams\n\nYou're just sleeping\n\nCrooked floors should never stop your feet\n\nFrom moving\n\n\n\nSay you need it more\n\nAnd you took it all\n\nI didn't look and I don't have it now\n\nI couldn't watch you fall\n\n\n\nYou say you're always living out your dreams\n\nYou're just sleeping\n\nCrooked floors should never stop your feet\n\nFrom moving\n\n\n\nFrom moving\n\nFrom moving\n\nFrom moving\n\nFrom moving",
