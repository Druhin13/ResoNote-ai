  "lyrics": "I fell for that girl straight up no chaser\r\nLike a red ribbon backwoods shine first placer\r\nNever took a shot of somethin' like that before\r\nAnd I’m still gonna chase her\r\nShe pulled up in her daddy's truck\n\nCut the engine off in a cloud of dust\n\nHopped down, fifth of Crown, standin' by the bonfire\n\nFriday night in this same ol’ town\n\nBut damn, I never seen her around\n\nSippin' that drink, her eyes locked on mine\n\n\n\nI fell for that girl straight up no chaser\n\nLike a red ribbon backwoods shine first placer\n\nNever took a shot of somethin' like that before\n\nIt's a sweet taste on my breath, can't erase her\n\nGot me tryin' play cool every time I face her\n\nA strong man could still be made a fool\n\nAnd I'm still gonna chase her\n\n\n\nNext thing I know it's just her and me\n\nDancin’ real close where nobody can see\n\nThe party in the background seems to fade away\n\nI’m gettin' lost with her lips on mine\n\nShes’ lettin' go like she's out of time\n\nDrivin' down the road before I know her name\n\n\n\nI fell for that girl straight up no chaser\n\nLike a red ribbon backwoods shine first placer\n\nNever took a shot of somethin’ like that before\n\nIt's a sweet taste on my breath, can't erase her\n\nGot me tryin' play cool every time I face her\n\nA strong man could still be made a fool\n\nAnd I'm still gonna chase her\n\n\n\nI fell for that girl straight up no chaser\n\nLike a red ribbon backwoods shine first placer\n\nNever took a shot of somethin' like that before\n\nIt's a sweet taste on my breath, can't erase her\n\nGot me tryin' play cool every time I face her\n\nA strong man could still be made a fool\n\nAnd I'm still gonna chase her",
