  "lyrics": "Stacy, I'd like to take you to a movie\r\nIn a world without a death wish\r\nOn a night under the fireworks in heaven\r\nOh but Stacy\r\nBaby, you can take me anywhere\r\nBecause I get a lot of low downs\n\nSo just put me in the cold ground and visit\n\nOh, but what if\n\nWhat if my soul was still trembling?\n\n\n\nWould you put your black dress on and visit my bones?\n\nAnd bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold\n\nPlaying melancholy songs that somehow made us\n\nFeel a whole lot better\n\nWell, I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow\n\nIn the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote\n\nWould I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?\n\nOr would you just go on?\n\n\n\nStacy, I never thought I'd miss the small talk\n\nI never knew the gift the day was\n\nI just used to hear the time clock\n\nWhistle stop\n\nSleep and get back up again\n\nStacy, I never thought I'd miss the hard love\n\nI wish I took the time to miss you\n\nWhile we were sitting only right there under heaven\n\nOh, but what if\n\nWhat if my soul was still trembling?\n\n\n\nWould you put your black dress on and visit my bones?\n\nAnd bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold\n\nPlaying melancholy songs that somehow made us\n\nFeel a whole lot better\n\nWell, I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow\n\nIn the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote\n\nWould I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?\n\nOr would you just go on?\n\n\n\nCould you promise me something if you find someone?\n\nThat you'll forget me not\n\nNever feel too much\n\nEven if they do all the things that I couldn't do for you\n\nAnd I'll promise you something if I find someone\n\nThat I'll forget you not\n\nNever feel too much\n\nEven if they do all the things that I couldn't do for you\n\nOh, but what if\n\nWhat if your soul was still trembling?\n\n\n\nAnd I would put my black suit on and visit your bones\n\nAnd bring a Football top and a play that you wrote\n\nAnd an English song by a band that you love\n\nHere comes the sun, little darling\n\nAnd the kingdom come and the trumpet blow\n\nIn the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote\n\nWould you get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?\n\nOr would you just go on?\n\n\n\nWould you put your black dress on and visit my bones?\n\nAnd bring my Football top and a scarf for the cold\n\n(Please forget me not)\n\nPlaying melancholy songs that somehow made us\n\nFeel a whole lot better\n\n(Would you just go on?)\n\nWell, I waited on the kingdom come and the trumpet blow\n\nIn the cold, hard ground there's some letters you wrote\n\n(Please forget me not)\n\nWould I get any rest from the wreck that I was with the living?",
