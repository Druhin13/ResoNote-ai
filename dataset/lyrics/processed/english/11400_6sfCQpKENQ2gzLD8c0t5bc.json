  "lyrics": "Clouds roll by as I look to the sky\r\nAnd then the feeling comes, it comes on again\r\nYou know desire burns like a fire, fire of sin\r\nOh, will I ever learn\r\nYou're the only one I would call my own\r\nBut then the shadows fall and I'm gone again\n\n\n\nI'm a hunter\n\nSearching for love\n\nOn these lonely streets again\n\nI'm the hunter\n\nSearching for the things\n\nThat I might never find again\n\n\n\nCare for you, you know that I always will\n\nI know it's hard for you, my taste for the kill\n\nBut then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky\n\nYou know it's not denied\n\nWill I ever find love and peace of mind\n\nOn these streets again, will it ever end\n\n\n\nI'm a hunter\n\nSearching for love\n\nOn these lonely streets again\n\nI'm the hunter\n\nSearching for the things\n\nThat I might never find again\n\n\n\nYou know desire burns like a fire, fire within\n\nI guess I'll never learn\n\nYou're the only one I would call my own\n\nBut when the shadows fall, you know I won't be wrong\n\nI'm a hunter\n\nSearching for love\n\nOn these lonely streets again\n\nI'm the hunter\n\nSearching for the things\n\nThat I might never find again\n\n\n\nI'm a hunter\n\nSearching for love\n\nI'm the hunter\n\nSearching for the things\n\nThat I might never find again.",
