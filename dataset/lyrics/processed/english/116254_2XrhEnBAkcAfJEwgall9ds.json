  "lyrics": "Dashing through the snow\r\nIn a one-horse open sleigh\r\nOver the fields we go\r\nLaughing all the way;\r\nBells on bob-tail ring\r\nMaking spirits bright\n\nWhat fun it is to ride and sing\n\nA sleighing song tonight, O\n\n\n\nJingle bells, jingle bells\n\nJingle all the way!\n\nO what fun it is to ride\n\nIn a one-horse open sleigh [repeat]\n\n\n\nNow the ground is white\n\nGo it while you're young\n\nTake the girls tonight\n\nAnd sing this sleighing song;\n\nJust get a bob-tailed bay\n\nTwo-forty as his speed\n\nHitch him to an open sleigh\n\nAnd crack! You'll take the lead\n\n\n\nJingle Bells, Jingle Bells\n\nJingle all the way!\n\nO what fun it is to ride\n\nIn a one-horse open sleigh. [repeat]\n\n\n\nHey, Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells\n\nJingle jingle all the way!\n\nO what fun it is to ride\n\nIn a one-horse open sleigh\n\nJingle Bells, Jingle Bells\n\nJingle jingle all the way!\n\nO what fun it is to ride\n\nIn a one-horse open sleigh\n\nJingle bells, jingle all the way!\n\nO what fun it is to ride\n\nIn a one-horse open sleigh\n\nJingle bells, jingle all the way!\n\nO what fun it is to ride\n\nIn a one-horse open sleigh\n\n\n\nI'm just crazy about horses",
