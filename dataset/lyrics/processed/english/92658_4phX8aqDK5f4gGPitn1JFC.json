  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson I Wish par Tom MacDonald\r\nI wish I wasn't fat, I wish I wasn't gay\nI wish I wasn't black, I wish that I was brave\nI wish, I wish, I wish with every candle on the cake\nThat I could quit doin' these drugs, but I can't and I'm afraid\nI wish that I was smart, I wish that I was rich\nI wish it wasn't hard for me to grow up and forgive\nI wish that I could help, I wish I wasn't sick\nI wish that I was Tom MacDonald, I'd be just like him\n\nI wish I wasn't sober, I miss it when the party wasn't over\nHappiness was right around the corner\n\nEvery single night was like the best one of our lives, now we're older\nThe good ol' days are out of reach, I wish that they were closer\nI wish I wasn't anxious, and I wish I could fast forward\nAnd I wish that I could rewind but they don't make that controller\nI wish the nights were longer, and I wish the days were shorter\nAnd I wish that I could sleep enough to maintain my composure\nI feel crazy, I wish that I was normal\nI wish that I could kill myself but also be immortal\nTake me to the oracle, I heard that time is borrowed\nCan you give me back my yesterdays, I'll give you my tomorrows?\n\nForget all of my morals and just live like I cannot remember sorrow\nBefore all of the tattoos and the cornrows\nI was different, I was happy, I was calmer, I was young and full of hormones\nNow I'm wishin' for a time machine, I'd step into that portal and be gone\n\nI wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?\nMaybe they were too far, hey-oh-nah-nah\nI must have blown apart a million dandelions\nNow they don't grow in my yard, hey-oh-nah-nah\n\nI wish I didn't care about the day that I'd be buried\nUsed to live like I was ready for it, always in a hurry\n\nNow I'm worried, all my memories are blurry\nI'm just barely turnin' 30 and the voices in my head are tryna hurt me\nThe choices that I made make me feel dirty, I was 25 at 13\nI was smokin' with the seniors, drinkin' beer and gettin' flirty\nNow the Ativan ain't workin' I need somethin' even stronger\nGive me childhood, my mother and my father and my sister\nAnd a Christmas to make up for all the recent ones I'm missin'\nWhile I'm tourin' the country for a livin'\nGive me a hug and a Nintendo and a toy box in the closet\nGive me everything I wish I had, oh wait I think I got it\n\nI'm a rapper like I always promised them I would accomplish\nThis is awesome man, I wish I had a friend to tell, I'd call 'em\nAnd I wonder if I jumped from here if I'd survive the bottom\nAnd would everyone believe me if I told 'em I had fallen?\nI'ma jump\n\nI wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?\nMaybe they were too far, hey-oh-nah-nah\nI must have blown apart a million dandelions\nNow they don't grow in my yard, hey-oh-nah-nah\n\nI wish we were kids again\nBefore everything was on Instagram, hey-oh\n\nThe things were so simple then\nMe, my tree fort, all of my friends\nWay back when, on Beaver Drive\nWhen the floor was lava, I could fly, hey-oh\nWished I was big like them\nNever thought I'd wanna be a kid again\n\nI wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?\nMaybe they were too far, hey-oh-nah-nah\nI must have blown apart a million dandelions\nNow they don't grow in my yard, hey-oh-nah-nah\nI wish on shooting stars, or were they satellites?\nMaybe they were too far, hey-oh-nah-nah\nI must have blown apart a million dandelions\nNow they don't grow in my yard, hey-oh-nah-nah",
