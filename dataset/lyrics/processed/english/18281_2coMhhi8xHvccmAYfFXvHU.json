  "lyrics": "In December I was cold\r\nFelt like I got swallowed by the trees\r\nJanuary I was filled with hope\r\nBut nothing changed at all, especially me\r\nLately I've been afraid of myself\n\nTried some pills but they didn't help\n\nWho can tell anymore how you're supposed to be you\n\nReally anything's true\n\nReally anything's gold\n\nIf you paint it that way\n\nI'm needing a statement to make\n\nSo I wrote out my life as a list\n\nThinking is this shit all there is?\n\n\n\nIn February I was out of luck\n\nCupid couldn't find my home address\n\nAugust brought a tender kind of touch\n\nBut lust it soon enough turned to regret\n\n\n\nStupid I've been abusing my mind\n\nNumber than ever I'm losing the time\n\nAnd all that I want is to do what's impossible\n\nHeard you got rushed to the hospital\n\nI called but the static was so loud\n\nNow I'm tracing the streets of our hometown\n\nYou never know what you'll miss\n\nTil the moment that you're leaving it\n\n\n\nIt's been a slow, slow march\n\nWaiting for a reason to move\n\nIt's been a slow, slow start\n\nBut I'm hoping that I'll make it to June\n\nIt's been a slow, slow march\n\nWaiting for the flowers to bloom\n\nIt's been a slow, slow start\n\nBut I know I could be somebody new\n\nSomebody new",
