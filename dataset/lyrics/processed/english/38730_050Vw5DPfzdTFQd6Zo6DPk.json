Comin' and goin'\r\nA time of wantin' but not really knowin'\r\nWe took the boat out of the water\r\nI'm really missing my son and missin' my daughter\r\nOoh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOoh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nPeople were walkin' by and sayin' hello\n\nI watched them from the cliff as they walk down below\n\nIt was a blue sky with white clouds rollin' in\n\nAnd tomorrow, it would all be there again\n\n\n\nBut I'd be gone\n\nBut I'd be gone\n\nBut I'd be gone\n\nBut I'd be gone\n\n\n\nThere was nothing that I've ever wanted half as much as this\n\nJust with you\n\nBe as happy as I was\n\nAs we floated on and floated on\n\nAnd how and what we've made\n\n\n\nSeems like I was just a kid not so long ago\n\nSo many arrivals\n\nSo many lows\n\nNow my time behind is greater than my time ahead\n\n\n\nSay look the mist like clouds\n\nBefore they're all dead and gone\n\nDead and gone\n\nDead and gone\n\nDead and gone\n\n\n\nYeah I'll be gone\n\nWell I'll be gone\n\nYeah I'll be gone",
