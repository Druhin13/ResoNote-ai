  "lyrics": "Well it's all over town that we're together\r\nWe did our best to hide our love away\r\nWell they say \"Loose lips sink ships\"\r\nIf that's true then this is hit\r\nMight as well let mother nature have her way\n\nSo let them talk, let them wonder\n\nLet 'em speculate about the spell we're under\n\nOh it's just between the two of us what we do behind closed doors\n\nSo let them talk, let them wonder\n\n\n\nWell I guess news travels fast here in a small town\n\nIt seems like we're the gossip of the day\n\nWell they say we're quite the pair\n\nWith our secret love affair\n\nWe don't care what other people have to say\n\n\n\nSo let them talk, let them wonder\n\nLet 'em speculate about the spell we're under\n\nOh it's just between the two of us what we do behind closed doors\n\nSo let them talk, let them wonder",
