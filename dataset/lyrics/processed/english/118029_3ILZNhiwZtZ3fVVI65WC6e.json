  "lyrics": "Snow is falling, it's on the ground\r\nFirst delayed but it's cancelled now\r\nLate to the train broke myself off\r\nAm I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?\r\nTaking the streets, I'm moving slow\r\nSure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?\n\nI just wanna get there before you go\n\nI hope I'm getting closer\n\nI hope I'm getting closer\n\n\n\nLeave the lights on\n\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\nLights on\n\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\nUnlock the door\n\nI'm coming, I'm coming\n\nNo matter how far\n\nLeave the lights on\n\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\n\n\nI'll be there in the morning\n\nI'll be there before you know it\n\nGoing fast as I can\n\nBut the traffic is bad\n\nAnd my rental is slow\n\nI'm coming, I'm coming\n\nI'm coming home\n\nYou on my team, I can't be alone\n\nYou hear that ring, I pick up the phone\n\nCall, a plane, a walk, a train\n\nNo matter which way baby, I'm coming home\n\nWish that I could press fast forward\n\nTo the part where I get there\n\nSeeing all the lights on\n\n\n\nLeave the lights on\n\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\nLights on\n\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\nUnlock the door\n\nI'm coming, I'm coming\n\nNo matter how far\n\nLeave the lights on\n\nIt may take a while but I'm coming home\n\n\n\nBar is low, texts slow\n\nNo goodbyes, no xo\n\nMy flight delay, no echo (Echo, echo, echo)\n\nHurry cause the plan's urgent\n\nI'm trying to get home like the man's version\n\nEmergency until I see you\n\nAnd then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon\n\nBut let me take your bow off\n\nWooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off\n\nYou my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door\n\nIt's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on\n\n\n\nYeah, leave the lights on",
