  "lyrics": "Read my mind, got me at a stop light\r\nStart me up, then you make a stop like\r\nWhy you gotta put me in the spotlight?\r\nBut you don't even ever hit the spot right\r\nYou're always riding my wave (riding, riding, riding, riding)\r\nBut never riding through\n\n\n\nYou get me up to let me down\n\nWay too many times to count\n\nWhy you gotta do that? (Why?)\n\nYou're the one who blew that\n\nMake it tough but get it loud\n\nYou're done but I'm ready now\n\nWhy you gotta do that? (Why?)\n\nYou're the one who blew that\n\n\n\nEvery time you come you do\n\nEvery time you come you do\n\n\n\nCall me up to comfort you and now I'm like\n\n\"Baby, it's already been a long night\"\n\nKeep playing it cool but it's time to change the mood\n\nGet to moving or you can move along\n\nStuck inside of your cage (I'm stuck right now)\n\nI play your game to lose over and over\n\n\n\nYou get me up to let me down\n\nWay too many times to count\n\nWhy you gotta do that? (Why?)\n\nYou're the one who blew that\n\nMake it tough but get it loud\n\nYou're done but I'm ready now\n\nWhy you gotta do that? (Why?)\n\nYou're the one who blew that\n\n\n\nI really thought you knew\n\nEvery time you come you leave me blue\n\n\n\nSomething inside me is swimming\n\nThought you did something you didn't\n\nSoon as I hit the beginning\n\nIs when you reached the end\n\nSomething inside me is swimming\n\nThought you did something you didn't\n\nSoon as I hit the beginning\n\nIs when you reached the end\n\n\n\nYou get me up to let me down\n\nWay too many times to count\n\nWhy you gotta do that? (Why?)\n\nYou're the one who blew that\n\nMake it tough but get it loud\n\nYou're done but I'm ready now\n\nWhy you gotta do that? (Why?)\n\nYou're the one who blew that\n\n\n\nI really thought you knew\n\nEvery time you come you leave me\n\nI really thought you knew\n\nEvery time you come you leave me blue",
