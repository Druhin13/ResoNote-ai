Like\n\n\n\nHead in the clouds, blood on leaves\n\nI won't leave, keep your eyes on me\n\nThere's air beneath your feet, watch your step\n\nAnd don't look left, you might lose me\n\nI said, \"I don't mind, I don't mind, I don't mind\"\n\nI won't leave, I'm by your side\n\nYour thoughts playin' tricks on your mind\n\nIf you never feel lost, just follow the light",
