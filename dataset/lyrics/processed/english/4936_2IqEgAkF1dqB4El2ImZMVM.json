(could you be mine?)\n\nCould you, could you be mine?\n\nHold me in the dark night (hold me in the dark night)\n\nWhen I'm all alone (could you be mine?)\n\nCould you be mine?\n\nI've been waiting for you (I've been waiting for you)\n\nHold me in the dark night (hold me in the dark night)\n\nWhen I'm all alone (could you be mine?)\n\nCould you, could you be mine?\n\nCould you, could you be mine?\n\nWith your dark eyes\n\nRunning through the nighttime (running through the nighttime)\n\nRight where you belong\n\nCould you be mine?\n\nI've been waiting for you (I've been waiting for you)\n\nCould you be mine?\n\nCould you, could you be mine?",
