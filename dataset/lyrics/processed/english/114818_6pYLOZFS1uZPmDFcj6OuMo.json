  "lyrics": "Well, I felt the burn\r\nSince the day you departed and talked from the tomb\r\nI'm still healing those wounds\r\nAnd it holds me down\r\nBut made me a man that says, \"Fuck all those rules\r\nI will be who I choose\"\n\n\n\nIt's a lonely road\n\nWith one grip on several psalms and one grip on the gun\n\nAnd it holds the rope\n\nIt spins me in circles and dizzies my head\n\nThen says sleep when you're dead\n\n\n\nWere you ever here?\n\nOr just lost on the surface that at the first touch\n\nJust evades in the dust\n\nAnd it pulled me down\n\nAnd showed me my demons lined up in a sequence\n\nForming a crowd\n\nIt was so long\n\nWith a piece of happy home that they stripped from the bone\n\nI did not react\n\nI settled my grievance by crafting a mask\n\nAnd I never looked back\n\n\n\nTell me what you know\n\nI'm in deeper than I've ever been\n\nI will never grow\n\nWhile this anchor is chained to my feet\n\nTell me what you know\n\nI'm in deeper than I've ever been\n\nI will never grow\n\nWhile this anchor is chained to my feet\n\nTell me what you know\n\nI settled my grievance by crafting a mask\n\nAnd I never looked-\n\nI will never grow\n\nI settled my grievance by crafting a mask\n\nAnd I never looked-\n\nTell me what you know\n\nI settled my grievance by crafting a mask\n\nAnd I never looked-\n\nI will never grow\n\nI settled my grievance by crafting a mask\n\nAnd I never looked back",
