  "lyrics": "If you don't seek justice, you probably don't know peace\r\nAt least the kind of peace that Jesus brings us on account of belief\r\nI don't know if you've noticed but there's a direct corellation\r\nBetween your profession of faith and your expressions of grace to the hopeless\r\nYeah, it's true that all men are broken but to only help the healthy\r\nWould make us miss the open wounds that matter the most in those moments\n\nThe deconstruction of dignity buried deep in the heart of assumptions\n\nWhere selective justice is just another name for social corruption\n\nA system is flawed when just cause is \"just because\"\n\nBut even a man at odds with the law is made in the image of God\n\nIt's admitted that none of us are innocent all of us complicit\n\nBut to solicit the silence of injustice doesn't just dismiss it\n\nAnd just in case you forgot Christ will come at just the right time\n\nA divine king bringing perfect justice to judge all of mankind\n\nThe only difference between us I'll stay seated at Jesus' feet\n\nAnd rest between the span of His hands where justice and mercy meet\n\n\n\nThere's a virus in my iris\n\nAlways blinded, close my eyelids\n\nSee my Savior laying down his righteous life\n\nAnd saying \"I forgive\" (x3)\n\nVirus in my iris\n\nDeep down I know my eyes are sick\n\n\n\nThe wrath of God is coming, can you hear the warning?\n\nJoy comes in the morning but now is a time of mourning\n\nWhen all I'm seeing lately is a nation going crazy\n\nLooking bad, need some hope like the words maybe\n\nIf we're probably, but if I'm honest in light of all these problems\n\nIf my hope is only probable, how long 'til it dissolves?\n\nI don't have the capacity to see these problems solved\n\nI take comfort knowing that my God is still involved\n\nThat's my certainty when the road I'm on is serpentine\n\nAnd I'm threatened by the serpent's sting, the evil one is prowling\n\nLooking to devour, but no one can usurp the King\n\nLord, have mercy while we're waiting for the final hour\n\nThis is my Father's world, it's also a fallen one\n\nThe domino effect has infected the whole set-up\n\nI'm not afraid to talk about social injustices\n\nLet's also talk about the throne where perfect justice is\n\nIt sounds insensitive and some will hate the stench of it\n\nBut the church is not faithful if we fail to mention it\n\nWe worship a God who can speak to the world's pain\n\nPure salvation for us came through the Lamb who was slain\n\n\n\nThere's a virus in my iris\n\nAlways blinded, close my eyelids\n\nSee my Savior laying down his righteous life\n\nAnd saying \"I forgive\" (x3)\n\nVirus in my iris\n\nDeep down I know my eyes are sick",
