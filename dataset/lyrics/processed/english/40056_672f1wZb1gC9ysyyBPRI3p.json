  "lyrics": "I’ve been sleepin’ in my mind\r\nBut my heart is risin’, risin’ with the tides\r\nFloating on a wave, buoyed by the sea\r\nCarry me away ‘cause the world is not for me\r\nIf I could see through different eyes\r\nFrom ten thousand foot skies, I’d navigate the lies\n\nAnd Never fear demise, nor be timid of the rule\n\nHow can I grow wise if never I’m a fool?\n\n\n\nHome, home is in my heart\n\nSo why do I get lost in the crowd?\n\nTrying to be proud\n\nI must be quiet enough to hear sound\n\nThe song inside my soul as it echoes in the clouds\n\nI’m going to sing it loud\n\nI’m going to sing it loud\n\n\n\nRaindrops ripple as I breathe\n\nI can feel the deep blue miles from my feet\n\nComing up for air, conscience coming clean\n\nI have left the past at the bottom of the sea\n\n\n\nHome, home is in my heart\n\nSo why do I get lost in the crowd?\n\nTrying to be proud\n\nI must be quiet enough to hear sound\n\nThe song inside my soul, I’m going to write it down\n\nI’m going to sing it loud\n\nI’m going to sing it loud\n\nOh, no matter where you land\n\nOr how far you may fall\n\nYou have heart; you have hands\n\nAnd the highest calling of our lives\n\nIs to find the grace in the very place we stand\n\nAnd rise\n\n\n\nRise\n\nWe will rise",
