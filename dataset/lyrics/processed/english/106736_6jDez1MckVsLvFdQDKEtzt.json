  "lyrics": "You, lit all in white,\r\nYou're the coastline,\r\nStill dividing everything in sight in two.\r\nThe floor was a tide,\r\nIt's all that I want, it's all that I wore in time.\n\nHardly anything, hardly anything works now...\n\nHardly anything, hardly anything works now...\n\n\n\nYou made up for my life, celebrate it!\n\nAnnotating, everything's implied.\n\nAnd it grew,\n\nI just couldn't decide,\n\nFor all that I want, I'm dying to scale its side.\n\n\n\nHardly anything, hardly anything works now...\n\nHardly anything, hardly anything works now...\n\n\n\nBetter wide-awake, better hide, but I'm forgetting where I came from.\n\nBetter emigrate, better try, but I've forgotten what I'm made of.",
