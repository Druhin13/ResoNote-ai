  "lyrics": "Jesus, I need You; lover, don't leave\r\nDid You call my name\r\nJust to plunge me deep into the darkness?\r\nDo You know that I can't even hear Your voice?\r\nAccusers around me on every side\n\nWhispering to me that I'm willfully blind\n\nThat I'm clinging to nothing\n\nBut all that I want is to clear the noise\n\n\n\nSo I reach out my hands to find You where You have been hiding\n\nMaybe I'll see You deep in the eyes of the dying\n\n\n\nAnd You know I'm not asking You for a sign\n\nI trusted Your promise, I gave You my life\n\nBut I guess I just miss You\n\nI feel so alone in the silence\n\n\n\nSo I move closer to plague and disease and disorder\n\nMaybe I'll hold You in the beggars and thieves that You died for\n\n\n\nJust stay, just stay with me\n\nOh, just stay, just stay with me\n\nI'll rejoice in my suffering\n\nIf You just stay, just stay with me\n\n\n\nI look to the hills, I lift up my eyes to the heavens\n\nMaybe I'll see You flickering on the horizon",
