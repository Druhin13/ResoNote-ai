  "lyrics": "Lost in a churning mindless fulmination\r\nDevoid of a reason or explanation\r\nA chorus of voices become a roaring cacophony\r\nAssaulting our senses as they sleep\r\nPutrid beings within, no better, or worse\n\nEach one scrambling for a ladder\n\nDeath becomes us, that which we adore\n\nLong lost innocence\n\n\n\nIn these slime-ridden Kingdoms where we wallow\n\nFree from the pity, disgust and sorrow\n\nFar from where light can pierce\n\nDrowned by the fetid bog\n\nBeyond the graces of your god\n\n\n\nSink in, inhale the ichor\n\nWhy not assume your true form?\n\nJoin with us this is our blessing\n\nUnified as one forever\n\nBiologically entwined\n\nTogether until the end time\n\n\n\nHideous depravity lurks beneath the mask of civility\n\n\n\nLook to your heathen master for his coming\n\nWe shall obey him and speak of nothing\n\nMentor of pain and suffering\n\nThe spawn of the sentient ooze\n\nSoon you will drown within him too\n\n\n\nIn the name of the Greatfather, worship him and no other\n\nBestow upon us the sigil, arise from your silent ritual",
