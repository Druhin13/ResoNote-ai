  "lyrics": "It's got a hole in the elbow, bandana pocket\r\nSilver button missin' from the snap at the bottom\r\nI said, \"That thing's seen better days, Daddy, you should toss it\"\r\nAnd he said \"Darlin I canâ€™t\"\r\nThis thing is two-thousand bonfires, I hitchhiked to Boulder\n\nIt's kept a million raindrops off your mama's shoulders\n\nMy heart on my sleeve, my life in these patches\n\nThen he wrapped his arms around me in that old\n\nJean jacket\n\n\n\nIt's been a bed for a hound-dog, a picnic blanket\n\nThere's blood on the collar from a punk who tried to take it from me\n\nSeen Willie Nelson play four or five states\n\nThe best Levi ever made\n\n\n\nWe strung for miles of barbed wire in Corinth, Mississippi\n\nA night in county jail with an old drunk and a hippy\n\nIt's my heart on the sleeve, it's my life in these patches\n\nWith his arms wrapped around me in that old\n\nJean jacket\n\n\n\nIt ain't much to look at, but he let me have it\n\nSo I could feel his arms around me in that old\n\nJean jacket\n\nJean jacket",
