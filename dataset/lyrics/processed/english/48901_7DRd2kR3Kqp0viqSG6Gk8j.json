  "lyrics": "Waiting for the time to pass you by\r\nHope the winds of change will change your mind\r\nI could give a thousand reasons why\r\nAnd I know you, and you've got to\r\nMake it on your own, but we don't have to grow up\n\nWe can stay forever young\n\nLiving on my sofa, drinking rum and cola\n\nUnderneath the rising sun\n\nI could give a thousand reasons why\n\nBut you're going, and you know that\n\n\n\nAll you have to do is stay a minute\n\nJust take your time\n\nThe clock is ticking, so stay\n\nAll you have to do is wait a second\n\nYour hands on mine\n\nThe clock is ticking, so stay\n\n\n\nWon't admit what I already know\n\nI've never been the best at letting go\n\nI don't wanna spend the night alone\n\nGuess I need you, and I need to\n\n\n\nMake it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up\n\nWe can stay forever young\n\nLiving on my sofa, drinking rum and cola\n\nUnderneath the rising sun\n\nI could give a million reasons why\n\nBut you're going, and you know that\n\n\n\nAll you have to do is stay a minute\n\nJust take your time\n\nThe clock is ticking, so stay\n\nAll you have to do is wait a second\n\nYour hands on mine\n\nThe clock is ticking, so stay\n\n\n\nAll you have to do is stay\n\nAll you have to do is stay\n\nJust stay\n\n\n\nAll you have to do is stay a minute\n\nJust take your time\n\nThe clock is ticking, so stay\n\nAll you have to do is wait a second\n\nYour hands on mine\n\nThe clock is ticking, so stay",
