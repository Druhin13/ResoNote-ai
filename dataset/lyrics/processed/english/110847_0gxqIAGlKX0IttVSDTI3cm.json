  "lyrics": "For so long I carried the weight of my past\r\nCripple by burdens like stones on my back\r\nI thought I had fallen too far from your grace\r\nBut you came and showed me the way\r\nWhen I was lost soul searching\n\nYou were the ground beneath my feet\n\nWhen I was blind man begging\n\nYou were the eyes so I could see\n\nWhen the smoke was rising up\n\nYou were the air that I could breath\n\nYou gave me hope you gave me something to believe\n\n\n\nNow I'm alive and born again\n\nRescued from the grip of sin\n\nGod your love came crashing in\n\nAnd pulled me out of the fire\n\nI'm a survivor\n\n\n\nNow all I can see are the fields of your grace\n\nWherever I run your leading the way\n\nYou shook the shackles off my feet\n\nI found redemption on my knees\n\nYou gave me hope you gave me something to believe\n\n\n\nNow I'm alive and born again\n\nRescued from the grip of sin\n\nGod your love came crashing in\n\nAnd pulled me out of the fire\n\nI'm a survivor\n\nOh I'm a survivor\n\n\n\nYou're my God\n\nYou're my fighter\n\nYou make me a survivor\n\n\n\nNow I'm alive and born again\n\nRescued from the grip of sin\n\nGod your love came crashing in\n\nAnd pulled me out of the fire\n\nI'm a survivor\n\nOh I'm a survivor\n\nYou pulled me out of the fire\n\nI'm a survivor",
