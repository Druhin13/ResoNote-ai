  "lyrics": "I'm at the end of my rope\r\nAnd I'm starting to choke\r\nThe noose is tightening around my throat\r\nIt's strangling the hope\r\nThat's hiding in my soul\r\nI argue with myself 'cause I can't take control\n\nSo drag me through the trough\n\nWith my Vietnam cough\n\nAnd take this straitjacket off\n\n\n\nI'm powerless and down\n\nAnd cracking from the stresss\n\nConstricting like a python as it tightens 'round my chest\n\nI got a fucking death wish \n\nFighting all my enemies\n\nWrecking all their fucking dreams\n\nMy hands they bleed from the nails\n\nFingers make a fist\n\nDon't tell me I'm a fatalist\n\nDancing 'round so fantically\n\nLaughing so maniacally\n\nI can't escape insanity\n\n\n\nTrapped in my pain\n\nFight to keep myself sane\n\n\n\nSilent I scream\n\nTortured by these dark dreams\n\n\n\nSo get the fuck away from me and hide knives\n\n'Cause I can't trust myself tonight\n\nI'll straight up lie and say\n\nAnything to make it alright\n\nYou said you'd love me till the end\n\nNow you want to end?\n\nIt's not the end till I say so!\n\n\n\nTake your little razor blades\n\nCut me up and shed the pain\n\nLet them stitch my heart up, black it out\n\nHand print on the wall\n\nBlood holds me in thrall\n\nCastrated by the butcher's blade that severs all\n\n\n\nTrapped in my pain\n\nFight to keep myself sane\n\n\n\nSilent I scream\n\nTortured by these dark dreams\n\n\n\nNails rake the skin in perfect rows\n\nSpine shivers down from head to toe\n\nFeeling sicker every second that passes\n\nI vomit the pain as I puke till I gasp\n\nMy breathing quickens, heart starts to race\n\nThe lines sink deeper into my face\n\nPeel the filth away, a sick bloody habit\n\nPick through the scabs as I sift through the maggots\n\nTobacco stains and tar\n\nFingernails burnt and charred\n\nThe smell of piss and rain\n\nThe odor haunts my brain\n\n\n\nPsychotic\n\nThoughts from hell arise\n\nDo I wanna let silence die?\n\nKill myself to survive\n\nNeedle in my arm and the damage is done and I'm\n\n\n\nTrapped in my pain\n\nFight to keep myself sane\n\n\n\nSilent I scream\n\nTortured by these dark dreams",
