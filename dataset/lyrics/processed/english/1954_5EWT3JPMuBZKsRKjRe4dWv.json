  "lyrics": "There's a rainbow of babies\r\nDraped over the graveyard\r\nWhere all the dead sailors\r\nWait for their brides\r\nAnd the cold bitter snow\r\nHas strangled each grassblade\n\nWhere the salt from their tears\n\nWashed out with the tide\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nAnd I smiled on the Wabash\n\nThe last time I passed it\n\nYes I gave her a wink\n\nFrom the passenger side\n\nAnd my foot fell asleep\n\nAs I swallowed my candy\n\nKnowing he was in heaven\n\nBefore he died\n\n\n\nNow the harbor's on fire\n\nWith the dreams and desires\n\nOf a thousand young poets\n\nWho failed 'cause they tried\n\nFor a rhyme without reason\n\nFloats down to the bottom\n\nWhere the scavengers eat 'em\n\nAnd wash in with the tide\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nThe sun can play tricks\n\nWith your eyes on the highway\n\nThe moon can lay sideways\n\nTill the ocean stands still\n\nBut a person can't tell\n\nHis best friend he loves him\n\nTill time has stopped breathing\n\nYou're alone on the hill\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:",
