  "lyrics": "Worked the bars and sideshows along the twilight zone \nOnly a crowd can make you feel so alone \nAnd it really hit home \nBooze and pills and powders, you can choose your medicine \nWell here's another goodbye to another good friend \n\n\nAfter all is said and done \n\nGotta move while it's still fun \n\nLet me walk before they make me run \n\nAfter all is said and done \n\nI gotta move, it's still fun \n\nI'm gonna walk before they make me run \n\n\n\nWatched the taillights fading, there ain't a dry eye in the house \n\nThey're laughing and singing \n\nStarted dancing and drinking as I left town \n\nGonna find my way to heaven, `cause I did my time in hell \n\nI wasn't looking too good but I was feeling real well \n\n\n\nAfter all is said and done \n\nI gotta move I had my fun \n\nLet us walk before they make me run \n\n\n\nAfter all is said and done \n\nI did alright, I had my fun \n\nI will walk before they make me run",
