  "lyrics": "Long afloat on shipless oceans\r\nI did all my best to smile\r\n'til your singing eyes and fingers\r\nDrew me loving to your isle\r\nAnd you sang:\n\n\"Sail to me\n\nSail to me\n\nLet me enfold you\"\n\nHere I am\n\nHere I am\n\nWaiting to hold you\n\n\n\nDid I dream you dreamed about me?\n\nWere you hare when I was fox?\n\nNow my foolish boat is leaning\n\nBroken lovelorn on your rocks\n\nFor you sing:\n\n'Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow\n\nO my heart, o my heart, shies from the sorrow'\n\n\n\nI am puzzled as the oyster\n\nI am troubled as the tide:\n\nShould I stand amid your breakers?\n\nShould I lie with death my bride?\n\nHear me sing, 'Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you:\n\nHere I am, here I am, waiting to hold you'",
