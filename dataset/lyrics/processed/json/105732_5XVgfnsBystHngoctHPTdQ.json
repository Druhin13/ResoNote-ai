  "lyrics": "Wrote myself a letter, I told myself a lie\r\nThat you'll be coming home soon and then your name I sigh\r\nI read it every morning since you went away\r\nI'm living in a dream world and dying a little more each day\r\nWrote myself a love song, believing every word\n\nSaying that you love me in melodies unheard\n\nThat you'll be coming back soon and forever you will stay\n\nI'm living in a dream world and dying a little more each day\n\n\n\nSnow is on the sidewalk, it's cold inside my heart\n\nI look up and I wonder, have I lost my guiding star\n\nAnd everything is white outside, how can it be so dark?\n\n\n\nSay a prayer and thank God that your love is mine alone\n\nAnd never be another who could grace our happy home\n\nPray on Christmas morning that this time you will stay\n\nBut I'm living in a dream world and dying a little more each day\n\nYes, I'm dying\n\nFor love on Christmas day",
