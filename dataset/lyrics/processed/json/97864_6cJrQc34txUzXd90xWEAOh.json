  "lyrics": "Now I'm confiding, know I'm in haze\r\nGone through the motions my whole life\r\nI hope this is the first day\r\nThat I connect motion to feeling\r\nWe spin slowly, we spin slowly 'til morning\n\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\n\nAppearance is nothing\n\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\n\nAppearance is nothing\n\nNow you're my lover, know that\n\nI fell at your ways\n\nAshamed lover\n\nWhen you touch me, I wonder what you would want with me\n\n\n\nIt feels like like a thousand pounds of weight holding your body down in a pool of water, barely reaching your chin\n\n\n\nI will assume form, I'll leave the ether\n\nI will assume form, I'll be out of my head this time\n\nI will be touchable by her, I will be reachable\n\nI couldn't tell you where my head goes either\n\n\n\nBut it wanders 'til I'm high up\n\nWhere I'm not all here, and there's no karma\n\nWhen you touch me, I wonder\n\nI always wonder what you could want with me\n\n\n\nI will assume form, I'll leave the ether\n\nI will just fall and be beneath her\n\nI will be touchable, I will be reachable\n\n'Cause I can already see that this goes deeper\n\n\n\nNow you can feel everything\n\nDoesn't it seem unnatural?\n\nDoesn't it seem frauded?\n\nDoesn't it feel connective?\n\nDoesn't it see you crying?\n\nDon't you know your best side shows when you're unaware?\n\nNot thinking, just primal\n\nNow you can feel everything\n\nDoesn't it get much clearer?\n\nDoesn't it seem connecting?\n\nDoesn't it get you starting?\n\nDoesn't it make you happier?\n\nDoesn't it feel more natural?\n\nDoesn't it see you float?\n\nDoesn't it seem much warmer?\n\nJust know in the sun, we'll be out",
