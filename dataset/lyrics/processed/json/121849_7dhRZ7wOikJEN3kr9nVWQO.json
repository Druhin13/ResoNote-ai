That don't really matter, though\"\n\nI'm like, \"Oh shit,\" thinkin' 'bout where this gonna go\n\nSo I proceed, man's never did this shit before, aye\n\nBack to her place now, tryna get my thing up\n\n2 AM, whiskey dick, 80% discount\n\nSo I had to go down, cruising down to poon town\n\nMaking sure I put that bitch's frown on upside-down\n\nGetting pretty wet, sweat running down her neck\n\nAnd the kitty so cute, I wanna keep it as a pet\n\nShe so clean, man, that pussy smell like honeydew zest\n\nFinally getting hard, so you know what's finna happen next\n\n\n\nAin't no game that I play when it comes to\n\nGetting that kitty out the cage for my night, go\n\nDrive to store just to buy a fuckin' mattress\n\nIf that can mean she gon' end up on my nitrous\n\n\n\nStruggling to put the Jimmy on, turning red, I feel like a million\n\nThen she getting on top and your boy just start to feel hysteria\n\n\"Bump and Grind\" playing in the stereo when I told her, \"It's my first time\"\n\nAnd she told me, \"Baby, it's fine, I don't mind\", she held my hand and it was intertwined\n\nMy god, it was nothing like what I had in my mind\n\nNow it's time to put it in, baby, now it's primetime\n\nThis is where the fun begun\n\nHeard her moan and I'm feeling like I'm 'bout to fuckin' cum\n\nHeard a knock, now your boy's got to go and fuckin' run\n\nThen I made a jump, heard the loudest scream ever\n\nIt was from her fuckin' mom, aye\n\nCalled Mike on the team, said I need to leave the scene\n\nHe done picked me up, told him 'bout the girl that did the deed\n\nEven said her name, then he asked if he could take a peek\n\nJumped out his fuckin' seat, turns out I fucked his sis",
