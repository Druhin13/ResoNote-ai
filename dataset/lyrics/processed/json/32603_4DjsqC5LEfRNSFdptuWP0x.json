  "lyrics": "I couldn't have done it\r\nWithout my mother being told to have an abortion, and still chose to push me out her stomach\r\nI couldn't have done it\r\nWithout god guiding my foot steps through the fires, and even then my blessings were abundant\r\nI couldn't have done it\n\nWithout my manager, every other month loaning me a 100\n\nMy dawgs done hit the western union that keeping me funded\n\nE-cloudy and rock cannon when I tried to shoot my way to the top\n\nLike 2pac standing in the elevator on some bishop and cube shit\n\nJust thinking about it make me want to twist up its too lit\n\nNow its champagne rain at midnight on new years\n\nI don't care who appear through my rear view mirrors",
