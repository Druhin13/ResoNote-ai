  "lyrics": "I'm a broke-nose fighter\r\nI'm a loose-lipped liar\r\nSearching for the edge of darkness\r\nBut all I get is just tired\r\nI went looking for attention\n\nIn all the wrong places\n\nI was needing a redemption\n\nAnd all I got was just cages\n\n\n\nIf I'm being real honest\n\nI'm fighting uphill battles\n\nI can't seem to find the right light\n\n'Cause I've been living in the shadows\n\n\n\nI went looking for attention\n\nIn all the wrong places\n\nI was seeking recognition\n\nBut all I got was just cages\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nOoh, ooh\n\n\n\nLooking back on all the wreckage\n\nAll I see is their faces\n\nHow many hearts have I broken?\n\nAnd tell me, are they still breaking?\n\n\n\nI went looking for attention\n\nIn all the wrong places\n\nI was needing a redemption\n\nGet me out of these cages\n\n\n\nOoh, I had a bright white dream\n\nOoh, It was pulling on me\n\nOoh, 'till I was almost dead\n\nOoh, here in these cages\n\n\n\nThere's a window in this cage I'm in\n\nI can see what kind of man that I've been\n\nI'm in a prison for a man gone wrong\n\nBut I've found a future, this is not my home\n\n\n\nWe're a band of outsiders\n\nSpend our whole life chasin'\n\nTrying to climb a little higher\n\nBut the high just faded\n\n\n\nWent looking for attention\n\nIn all the wrong places\n\nWe were needin' a redemption\n\nAll we got was just cages",
