  "lyrics": "When you're lost in the moment\r\nYou can't see where you're going\r\nI didn't know who I could trust\r\nSo I put all my faith in us\r\nOh, you tore me to pieces\r\nTurned my strength into weakness\n\nI didn't want it all to fall apart\n\nSo I decided just to play the part\n\n\n\nBut honestly, I do it all again\n\nPutting up with all the bullshit\n\nHe made me strong enough to do this\n\n\n\nIt used to bother me\n\nThought I could never leave?\n\nAfter all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you\n\nWeighin' down on me\n\nI lost my sanity\n\nAnd now that we are through\n\nNothin' left to lose\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you\n\n\n\nI feel freedom where I stand now\n\nAnd I feel proud for who I am now\n\nYeah, I learned a lot along the way\n\nI love the woman that I became\n\n\n\nI was patient, but not anymore\n\nRespect back in my hands\n\nAnd you swore I'll never do it\n\nBut it's your turn to face the music\n\n\n\nIt used to bother me\n\nThought I could never leave?\n\nAfter all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you\n\nWeighin' down on me\n\nI lost my sanity\n\nAnd now that we are through\n\nNothin' left to lose\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you\n\n\n\nIt was hard to hold on\n\nDays and nights I thought I'd never make it at all\n\nCouldn't make it at all\n\nNow I stand tall\n\nFeeling like myself again, no worries at all\n\nBreathe\n\nNo one can stop me from livin' this moment for me\n\nI found my heartbeat\n\nAfter all that I've been through\n\nNo, I don't think about you\n\n\n\nIt used to bother me\n\nThought I could never leave?\n\nAfter all that I've been through, nothin' left to prove\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you\n\nWeighin' down on me\n\nI found my sanity\n\nAnd now that we are through\n\nNothin' left to lose\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you\n\n\n\nI don't think about you (no)\n\nNo, no, no, (no no no) not anymore (not anymore)\n\nNo, no, no, I don't think about you",
