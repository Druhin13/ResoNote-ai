  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Grow par Conan Gray\r\n(Haaa-aaa)\nI look about seventy years older (Haaa-aaa,aaa)\nIt feels like minutes but really it's hours (Haaa-aaa,aaa)\nThe cooling pavements calling my name, (Haaa-aaa,aaa) and\nThe zooming street signs don't look the same, no\nDon't know why, but I think (Haaa-aaa,aaa) I'm ready for it\nYeah, I think I'm ready for\n\nRunning on concrete\nElectricity (Haaa)\nI finally can breathe\nI think I'm ready for\n\n\nOnly you and me\nWe made it out, it seems (Haaa)\nI made it out, it seems\nI think I'm ready to\n\nGrow, to grow\nTo grow, to grow\n\nFamiliar sounds\nThe lake holds all our secrets (Haaa-aaa,aaa)\nNostalgia bound\nYeah I'll take my time evolving (Haaa)\nDreaming of phone calls\nYou knew all along (Haaa)\nThe way we joked till we laughed our tails off\n\nSee it all unfold\nAn emerald life before me (Haaa-aaa,aaa)\n\nYeah I think I'm ready for\n\nRunning on concrete\nElectricity (Haaa)\nI finally can breathe\nI think I'm ready for\n\nOnly you and me\nWe made it out, it seems (Haaa)\nI made it out, it seems\nI think I'm ready to\n\nGrow, to grow\nTo grow, to grow\n\nYeah I see it comin', I see it comin'\nOh boy I'm runnin', oh boy I'm runnin'\nI see it comin', I see it comin'\n\nOh boy I'm runnin'\nAnd oh boy I'm runnin', runnin'\n\nGrow, to grow\nTo grow, to grow\n\n(Grow, to grow)\nPure reality, don't know where it'll lead\nBut everything's a dream\nI think I'm ready for\n(To grow, to grow)\nOnly you and me\nWe made it out it seems\nI made it out it seems\nI think I'm ready, ready",
