  "lyrics": "City of stars, are you shinigng just for me?\r\nCity of stars, there's so much that I can't see.\r\nWho knows?\r\nI felt It from the first embrace I shared with you.\r\nThat now our dreams, they've finally come true.\n\nCity of stars, just one thing everybody wants.\n\nThere in the bars,\n\nAnd throw the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants.\n\nIt's love,\n\nYes all we're looking for is love from someone else\n\n\n\nA rush.\n\nA glence.\n\nA touch.\n\nA dance.\n\n\n\nTo look in somebody's eyes.\n\nTo light up the skies.\n\nTo open the world and send them reeling.\n\nA voice that says, I'll be here And you'll be alright.\n\n\n\nI don't care if I know.\n\nJust where I will go.\n\nCause all that I need's this crazy feeling.\n\nA rat-tat-tat on my heartÂ…\n\n\n\nThink I want it to stay...\n\nCity of stars, are you shining just for me?\n\n\n\nCity of stars\n\n\n\nYou never shined so brightly",
