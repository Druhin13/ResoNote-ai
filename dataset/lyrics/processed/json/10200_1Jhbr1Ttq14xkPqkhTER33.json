  "lyrics": "I need the violence on the radio\r\nI need a murderous sound just to let me know\r\nThere's no one talking to me, but I'm talking back\r\nAnd every word's a ghost I keep looking at\r\nIt's another song\n\nThen it's gone\n\nIt's just another song\n\nAnd then it's gone\n\n\n\nI'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie\n\nI'll be your last mistake (you take, you take)\n\nEverything a little lie, lie, lie\n\nI never really can\n\n\n\nI'll be the hollow chase of a tragic line\n\nIt got the kids in tow just to feed their mind\n\nBut sniffing only can pull apart\n\nIt takes a dead-end soul to kill a dead-end heart\n\n\n\nIt's another song\n\nThen it's gone\n\nIt's just another song\n\nAnd then it's gone\n\n\n\nI'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie\n\nI'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)\n\nEverything a little lie, lie, lie\n\nI never really can\n\n\n\nI'm gonna tell you how it feels\n\nI'm gonna tell you how it was\n\nI'm waiting on a call, yeah\n\nI'm waiting on a vision\n\nI'm waiting on the phone but this dead song said\n\nI'm waiting on the call\n\nAnd I'm waiting on a vision\n\nI'm waiting on the phone and this dead song said\n\nBeen waiting on the phone and this dead song said\n\nBeen waiting on the phone and this dead song said\n\nBeen waiting on the phone, the dead song said\n\nBeen waiting on the phone and this dead song said\n\n\n\nI'll be your innocent lie, lie, lie\n\nI'll be the last mistake (you take, you take)\n\nEverything a little lie, lie, lie",
