  "lyrics": "All the times we have shared and all the memories I have, \nbrought me back to square one. \nNow I'm running on empty. \nOnly you could pick me up, \nwithout thinking twice, \nyou wrapped your arms around me. \n\n\n\nWhen we find truth inside ourselves, \n\nit's hard not to run away. \n\nBut we must capture and embrace. \n\nIt's how we truly live our lives. \n\n\n\nWe will be everything we have been dreaming of. \n\n\n\nWhen I look in the mirror what I see, \n\nis the only thing that I can be. \n\nI come to you now, defenses down. \n\nDefenseless now. \n\nWhen you look at me I want to be, \n\neverything you want to see. \n\nI come to you now defenses down. \n\nDefenseless now",
