  "lyrics": "Violence! In holy brimstone plumed\r\nWild destruction sovereign\r\nThe beast sublime\r\nA wolf upon the ridge at night\r\nHungry is the dark\r\nFrom where extends the radiant blade\n\n\n\nHeld steadily at my throat\n\nIt has sharpened my voice\n\nSo that it one day may pierce\n\nWhatever stands before me\n\nRaised from affliction to the mighty halls\n\nIn veneration of the devilgod\n\nResonating as the heavens fall\n\n\n\nBorn of the power\n\nThat authors the vehemence of the cobras thrust\n\nAnd the willingness in the blind perdition of the storm\n\nIn cruelty so utterly precise\n\n\n\nA leprous smile\n\nBehind each prophets neck\n\nThe eternal curse\n\nA black wound hissing\n\nIn the christ flesh\n\n\n\nSo we make our offering\n\nWith voice and blade alike\n\nFrom the flames of sacrifice\n\nA sulphurous scent\n\nFrom affliction to the mighty halls\n\nTo the kingdom of the devilgod\n\nWhere freedom is the only law\n\n\n\nOf iron will is the anvil wrought\n\nAnointed with the blood of tyrants\n\nIn sacred flame our vengeance forged\n\n\n\nOne single stab to penetrate the armor of our foes\n\nAs truth is told, their laws denied\n\nTheir heaven spent, damnation sanctified",
