  "lyrics": "Sam Stone came home,\r\nTo his wife and family\r\nAfter serving in the conflict overseas.\r\nAnd the time that he served,\r\nHad shattered all his nerves,\r\nAnd left a little shrapnel in his knee. \n\nBut the morphine eased the pain,\n\nAnd the grass grew round his brain,\n\nAnd gave him all the confidence he lacked,\n\nWith a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nThere's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,\n\nJesus Christ died for nothin' I suppose.\n\nLittle pitchers have big ears,\n\nDon't stop to count the years,\n\nSweet songs never last too long on broken radios.\n\nMmm....\n\n\n\nSam Stone's welcome home\n\nDidn't last too long.\n\nHe went to work when he'd spent his last dime\n\nAnd Sammy took to stealing\n\nWhen he got that empty feeling\n\nFor a hundred dollar habit without overtime. \n\nAnd the gold rolled through his veins\n\nLike a thousand railroad trains,\n\nAnd eased his mind in the hours that he chose,\n\nWhile the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nSam Stone was alone\n\nWhen he popped his last balloon\n\nClimbing walls while sitting in a chair\n\nWell, he played his last request\n\nWhile the room smelled just like death\n\nWith an overdose hovering in the air\n\nBut life had lost its fun\n\nAnd there was nothing to be done\n\nBut trade his house that he bought on the G. I. Bill\n\nFor a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus",
