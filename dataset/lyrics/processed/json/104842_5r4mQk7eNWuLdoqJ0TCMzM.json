Oh\n\nNowadays it’s blind admiration on some bull foundation\n\nAll these obligations\n\nOh, get up over it\n\n\n\n’Cause I won't be that girl when\n\nEven little Miss Perfect’s judged by everybody\n\n\n\nYou say I'm faulty, faulty, faulty\n\nWhy don't you get the fuck out of my way, give me backache?\n\nIf you're looking for a guarantee you’ll be better off with a machine\n\nFaulty, faulty, faulty\n\n\n\nA bitch I might be\n\nA bitch I might be\n\nA bitch I might be",
