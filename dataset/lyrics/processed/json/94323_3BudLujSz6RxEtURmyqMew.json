  "lyrics": "Go breathe it out\r\nWalk your walk\r\nCome back when you're ready to talk\r\nBut heart ringing, take the call\r\nOur life is in print to play\r\nFlip the set if it's starting to fray\n\nIf there's nothing new to crave\n\n\n\nCos you know\n\nThat every city has a Chinatown\n\n\n\nCall Tokyo, call New York\n\nIt's just same but different, love\n\nCall Jupiter, call Lyon\n\nFind a right, and find a wrong\n\n\n\nWrite back, or lust write it off\n\nHasn't everybody suffered enough\n\nWith the carcass left of us?\n\nYour every-unhappy cruise\n\nOh. you've never looked good in blue\n\nAnd I'm the sunset, I'm the view\n\n\n\n'Cos we know\n\nThat every city has a Chinatown\n\n\n\nCall Tokyo, call New York\n\nIt's just same but different, love\n\nCall Jupiter, call Lyon\n\nFind a right, and find a wrong\n\n\n\nGet me London, get me Seoul\n\nSay it's me who's calling\n\nGirl, I'm lower than a dog\n\nAnd my ego's falling\n\nGet me Bangkok, get me Rome\n\nWhere all the hope is hiding\n\nJust know I'm numb and, I'm alone\n\nSo come back to me crying\n\n\n\nCall Tokyo, call New York\n\nIt's just same but different, love\n\nCall Jupiter, call Lyon\n\nFind a right, and find a wrong",
