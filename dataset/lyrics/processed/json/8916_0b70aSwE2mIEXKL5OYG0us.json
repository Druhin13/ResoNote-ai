  "lyrics": "People say that we're born with a purpose\r\nAnd that we're meant to make our dreams come true\r\nBut if our dreams start to crumble, they can bury us\r\nGotta take yourself out and push on through\r\nThey say that nobody changes\n\nBut I'm living proof that they do\n\nBecause I found the answer\n\nAnd you can find the answer, too\n\nThey made me think I was crazy\n\nAnd that the fate wants you to stay\n\nNow that I've found the answer\n\nI'm never ever gonna lose my way\n\n\n\nEver again\n\nEver again\n\n\n\nI'll admit there were times I was terrified\n\nI honestly thought I wouldn't survive\n\nBut I learned a lot from my trip to the dark side\n\nAnd from here on out I'll keep my light alive\n\n\n\nThey say that nobody changes\n\nBut I'm living proof that they do\n\nBecause I found the answer\n\nAnd you can find the answer, too\n\nThey made me think I was crazy\n\nAnd that the fate wants you to stay\n\nNow that I've found the answer\n\nI'm never ever gonna lose my way\n\n\n\nEver again\n\nEver again\n\nEver again\n\nEver again\n\n\n\nEver again\n\nEver again\n\nEver again\n\nEver again",
