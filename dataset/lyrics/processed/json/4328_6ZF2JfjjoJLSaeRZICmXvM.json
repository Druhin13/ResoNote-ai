  "lyrics": "This ain't something I'm used to\r\nDon't normally catch feelings for somebody like you\r\nAlready know love games so I stay on the move\r\nAnd I'm not for the loose situations\r\nNo time for beating around, round, round, round\n\nAre you patient?\n\n'Cause I know love takes some patience\n\nAnd I don't like playing around, round, round, round\n\n\n\nIf I needed you the most\n\nWould you be dependable\n\nTell me are you down, down, down\n\nTell me are you down to stay\n\nTell me are you down for me\n\n\n\nTell me, tell me\n\nAre you down for me\n\nTell me are you down\n\nTell me are you down for me\n\nTell me, tell me\n\nAre you down for me\n\nTell me are you down\n\n\n\nYou trusted me for the longest\n\nI finally give you a chance\n\nShow me you're a grown man, yeah\n\nIf you're wanting the key to my heart, oh\n\nWell show me that you're worth it\n\n\n\nNo time for beating around, round, round, round\n\nAre you patient?\n\n'Cause I know love takes some patience\n\nAnd I don't like playing around, round, round, round\n\n\n\nIf I needed you the most\n\nWould you be dependable\n\nTell me are you down, down, down\n\nTell me are you down to stay\n\nTell me are you down for me\n\n\n\nTell me, tell me\n\nAre you down for me\n\nTell me are you down\n\nTell me are you down for me\n\nTell me, tell me\n\nAre you down for me\n\nTell me are you down, ooh",
