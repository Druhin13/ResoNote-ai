  "lyrics": "It's been seven minutes now since I've lost my way\r\nIt doesn't seem that long but my whole world has changed\r\nIt's in all the little things, when you smile, now it stings\r\nIt's been seven minutes since I've lost the girl of my dreams\r\nIt's been half an hour now since I dropped you home\r\nAnd I'm driving past the places we both know\n\nPast the bar where we first kissed\n\nAnd that movie that we missed\n\n'Cause we were hanging out in the parking lot\n\nNow I sink a little deeper, think a little clearer\n\nLooking at myself through these newfound eyes\n\n\n\nIs it too late to turn around?\n\nI'm already halfway out of town\n\nNow I know how I let you down\n\nOh, I finally figured it out\n\n\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\n\n\nRadio's playing songs for me and you\n\n\"Chasing Cars\" reminds me of nights in your room\n\nDrinking wine under your window, back when love was so damn simple\n\nHow the hell did I end up losing you? Mm\n\n\n\nIs it too late to turn around?\n\nI'm already halfway out of town\n\nNow I know how I let you down\n\nOh, I finally figured it out\n\n\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you\n\n\n\nIf I came back now would you still be there?\n\nIf I come around would you even care?\n\nIf I came back now would you still be there?\n\nIf I come around would you even care?\n\n\n\nIs it too late to turn around?\n\nI'm already halfway out of town\n\nNow I know how I let you down\n\nOh, I finally figured it out\n\n\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you\n\nI forgot to love you, love you, love you",
