  "lyrics": "Well, ain't it a shame\r\nThat our short little memories\r\nNever seem to learn\r\nThe message of history\r\nWe keep makin' the same mistakes\r\nOver and over and over and over again\n\nAnd then we wonder why\n\nWe're in the shape we're in\n\n\n\nGood ol' boys down at the bar\n\nPeanuts and politics\n\nThey think they know it all\n\nThey don't know much of nothing\n\nEven if one of them was to read the newspaper\n\nCover-to-cover\n\nThat ain't what's going on\n\nJournalism's dead and gone\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nLight fading and the fog is getting thicker\n\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\n\nDark ages\n\n\n\nYou my love-drunk friend\n\nAll that red wine and candlelight\n\nSoulful conversations\n\nThat go on until the dawn\n\nHow many times can you tell your story?\n\nHow many hangovers can you endure\n\nJust to get some snuggling done?\n\nYou're living in a hollow dream\n\nYou don't have the slightest notion\n\nWhat long-term love is all about\n\nAll your romantic liasons\n\nDon't deal with eternal questions like\n\nWho left the cap off the freaking toothpaste?\n\nWhose turn to take the garbage out?\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nYou keep on rubbin' that, you're gonna get a blister\n\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\n\nI've seen it all before\n\n\n\nAnd we pray to our Lord\n\nWho we know is American\n\nHe reigns from on high\n\nHe speaks to us through middlemen\n\nAnd he shepherds his flock\n\nWe sing out and we praise His name\n\nHe supports us in war\n\nHe presides over football games\n\nAnd the right will prevail\n\nAll our troubles shall be resolved\n\nWe have faith in the Lord\n\nUnless there's money or sex involved\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nNobody's calling them for roughing up the pitcher (?)\n\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\n\nHeaven help us\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nAll waiting for that miracle elixir\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nI don't wonder anymore\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nSomebody says, \"You brought her here so go ahead and kiss her\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nLight fading and the fog is getting thicker\n\nIt's a frail grasp on the big picture\n\n\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\nFrail grasp on the big picture\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Sugumar for these lyrics)",
