  "lyrics": "She's a barmaid in a west Texas dance hall\rShe's there ev'ry night till they close\rAnd the cowboy's pay for the jukebox\rAnd she plays 'San Antonio Rose'\rWell I know her life ain't been easy\rLord, the lines in her face say it all\rBut she still is a beautifull woman\rIn the lights of the Texas dance hall\rBut she won't sit down at your table\rAnd I know that you can't hold her hand\rShe won't go home with you cowboy\rShe's in love with a rodeo man\rWell he's hard and he's scarred and he's gayin'\rAnd he's stoned most all of the time\rAnd he drinks at a dark corner table\rAnd he waits there until closin' time\rSo she won't sit down at your table\rAnd I know that you can't hold her hand\rShe won't go home with you cowboy\rShe's in love with a rodeo man\rShe won't sit down at your table And I know that you can't hold her hand\rShe won't go home with you cowboy\rShe's in love with a rodeo man\rShe won't sit down at your table\rAnd I know that you can't hold her hand\rShe won't go home with you cowboy\rShe's in love with a rodeo man",
