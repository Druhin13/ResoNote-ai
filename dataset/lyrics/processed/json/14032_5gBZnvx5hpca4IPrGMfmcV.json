  "lyrics": "Know exactly what I want, I want that Kennedy era\r\nSomething that's gon' last through the summertime weather\r\nNeed me a man who gon' be down with whatever\r\nI'm talkin' raining outside, give me your jacket for shelter\r\nGon' put it 50/50, stay if the bank is empty\r\nDon't listen to these hoes 'cause I know how hoes envy\n\nQuick respond to my text, the opposite of my ex\n\nIf he coming then I'm coming 'cause bitch we come as a set\n\nThat's for you, but all my old niggas, they were straight acting\n\nHad five bitches, claiming they his sisters, like they the Braxtons\n\nI peaked it, this nigga spent nights out on the weekend\n\nWent from talking eachother's heads off, to now we not speaking\n\nSo to the next man enter my life with a plan\n\nPlease don't just just plan on being labelled my man\n\nIf I ever fall I wanna fall on your hands\n\nThen when I open my eyes I wanna fall in a trance\n\n\n\nWhat is it worth? Is it worth not being solo?\n\nHow much love can you give me? What's the total?\n\nWhat is it worth? Is it worth not being solo?\n\nHow much love can you give me? What's the total?\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total, yeah\n\n\n\nLet me know\n\nLet me know\n\nLet me know, let me know, let me know\n\nLet me know, let me know, let me know\n\n\n\nFirst I gotta see if you're playing like the showtimes\n\nNot posting Insta pics into your post line\n\nKnow the game so don't try because I'm not a lame\n\nIt's not just weave in my head, I got a brain\n\nThe men I bring home gotta have some good ding dong\n\nLove like King Kong if you wanted the ringtone\n\nNot trying to pressure the man, I just want someone steady\n\nMake my toes curling 'round [?] me from a pedi\n\nSpeaking of petty I ain't watching Netflix and chill\n\nI wanna go to the movies, man, show me this reel\n\nLover man on his hustle, then going to get his skills\n\nThen went to buy Jordans and went to pay the bills\n\nWake up during the night just to get me some pop\n\nI need that one o' clock, on the dot, his phone not on lock\n\nThis is what I deserve, give me a stand up soul mate\n\nSomeone that can brush hoes off like Colgate\n\n\n\nWhat is it worth? Is it worth not being solo?\n\nHow much love can you give me? What's the total?\n\nWhat is it worth? Is it worth not being solo?\n\nHow much love can you give me? What's the total?\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total\n\nI'ma need a total, total, total, yeah\n\n\n\nWhat is it worth?\n\nHow much love can you give me?\n\nWhat is it worth?\n\nHow much love can you give me?\n\n\n\nLet me know\n\nLet me know\n\nLet me know, let me know, let me know\n\nLet me know, let me know, let me know",
