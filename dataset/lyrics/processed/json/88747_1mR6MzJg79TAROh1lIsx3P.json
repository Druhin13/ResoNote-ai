  "lyrics": "I got it bad for you, a bad heart\r\nI'm falling back to your arms like waves on a pebbled shore\r\nI'm 'bout to give in, my brain shuts down\r\nAnd then it hit me like a thunderstorm\r\nI can't see what I fell hard for\n\nI gotta go, feel it running through my veins\n\nAnd I can't stop it right now\n\nJust stay up late to hear my voice through your phone\n\nCaught in the night roaming through the streets now\n\nFeeling so damn good, yeah\n\nOpen my mind, everything is possible now\n\n\n\nI feel strong on my own\n\n'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\nI feel strong on my own\n\n'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\n\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\n\n\nGasoline to my burning fire\n\nGetting better every minute\n\nLet the rhythm take, take control\n\nAnd in this dance I see it clear\n\nOverflow of the waves pulling out from the pebbled shore\n\n\n\nI gotta go, feel it running through my veins\n\nAnd I can't stop it right now\n\nJust stay up late to hear my voice through your phone\n\nCaught in the night roaming through the streets now\n\nFeeling so damn good, yeah\n\nOpen my mind, everything is possible now\n\n\n\nI feel strong on my own\n\n'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\nI feel strong on my own\n\n'Cause I'm high on this adrenaline\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\n\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love\n\nOh, of my love, my love, my love, my love",
