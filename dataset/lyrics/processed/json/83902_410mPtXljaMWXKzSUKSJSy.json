  "lyrics": "I see the questions in your eyes \nI know what's weighing on your mind \nBut you can be sure I know my part \n'Cause I'll stand beside you through the years \nYou'll only cry those happy tears \nAnd though I'll make mistakes \n\nI'll never break your heart \n\n\n\nI swear \n\nBy the moon and stars in the sky \n\nI'll be there \n\nI swear \n\nLike the shadow that's by your side \n\nI'll be there \n\nFor better or worse \n\nTill death do us part \n\nI'll love you with every beat of my heart \n\nI swear \n\n\n\nI'll give you everything I can \n\nI'll build your dreams with these two hands \n\nWe'll hang some memories on the wall \n\nAnd when there's silver in your hair \n\nYou won't have to ask if I still care \n\n'Cause as time turns the page \n\nMy love won't age at all \n\n\n\nI swear \n\nBy the moon and stars in the sky \n\nI'll be there \n\nI swear \n\nLike the shadow that's by your side \n\nI'll be there \n\nFor better or worse \n\nTill death do us part \n\nI'll love you with every beat of my heart \n\nI swear \n\n\n\nI swear \n\nBy the moon and stars in the sky \n\nI'll be there \n\nI swear \n\nLike the shadow that's by your side \n\nI'll be there \n\nFor better or worse \n\nTill death do us part \n\nI'll love you with every beat of my heart \n\nI swear \n\nI swear",
