  "lyrics": "Feel it drawing nearer, an endless fear that takes you whole\r\nfeel it getting closer, revealing such an evil soul\r\nI can't surrender at the turning point of destiny\r\nRight now it's do or die, my life is on the line and I will not flee\n\nBy my power\n\n\n\nWoah, Woah, it's clear to me\n\nMy spirit grows and I will face this demon\n\nWoah, Woah, with burning energy,\n\nThe day of fate has finally come\n\n\n\nFeel it right behind you, a grinning monster out to kill\n\nFeel it grow inside you, a burning flame and force of will\n\n\n\nThoughts of a broken earth in every corner of my mind,\n\na loveless world devoid of life is what you hope to leave behind\n\n\n\nHear me crying\n\n\n\nWoah, Woah can't hold me down\n\nno doubt left in my mind I will not fall here\n\nWoah, Woah, prepare to hit the ground,\n\nI'll turn your laughter into fear\n\n\n\nThough you might turn the tide, I'll hold the line forever more\n\nThis flame inside of me burns brighter than it ever has before\n\n\n\nLet's get going\n\n\n\nWoah, Woah it's clear to me\n\nmy spirit grows and I will face this demon\n\nWoah, Woah with burning energy\n\nthe day of fate has finally come\n\n\n\nWoah, Woah it's clear to me\n\nmy spirit grows and I will face this demon\n\nWoah, Woah with burning energy\n\nthe day of fate has finally come",
