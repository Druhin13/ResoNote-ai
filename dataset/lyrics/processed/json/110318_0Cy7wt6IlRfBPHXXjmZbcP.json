  "lyrics": "You're the light, you're the night\nYou're the colour of my blood\nYou're the cure, you're the pain\nYou're the only thing I wanna touch\nNever knew that it could mean so much, so much\n\n\nYou're the fear, I don't care\n\nCause I've never been so high\n\nFollow me through the dark\n\nLet me take you past the satellites\n\nYou can see the world you brought to life, to life\n\n\n\nSo love me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do\n\nTouch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nFading in, fading out\n\nOn the edge of paradise\n\nEvery inch of your skin is a Holy Grail I've got to find\n\nOnly you can set my heart on fire, on fire\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nI'll let you set the pace\n\nCause I'm not thinking straight\n\nMy head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do\n\nTouch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do \n\nTouch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nI'll let you set the pace\n\nCause I'm not thinking straight\n\nMy head's spinning around, I can't see clear no more\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do\n\nTouch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\n\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do (like you do)\n\nLove me like you do, lo-lo-love me like you do\n\nTouch me like you do, to-to-touch me like you do\n\nWhat are you waiting for?",
