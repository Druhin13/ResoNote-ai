  "lyrics": "I've lived without bread and I've lived without water\r\nStuck outside the middle of the desert wishin' I was home\r\nLong way from no where, wishin' I was somewhere\r\nSangre de Cristo to the Devils Backbone\r\nI've been to California and North Carolina\n\nHung with the hippies in Austin and the cowboys of Mexico\n\nI've laid up in Fort Worth with beautiful ladies\n\nHitch hiked on down to Tijuana and hit the rodeo in San Anton...\n\n\n\nIn the back of a Ranchero, I rode down to Laredo\n\nHad a good time with the la posada, yea you know I was left alone\n\nOn a rig out of El Paso, rainin' down in Houston\n\nTold the truck driver put the pedal to the metal cause Houston gets me down\n\nOn down to Louisiana, Whiskey River Landing\n\nCrawfish pie and eat jambalaya with a big ole coon ass smile",
