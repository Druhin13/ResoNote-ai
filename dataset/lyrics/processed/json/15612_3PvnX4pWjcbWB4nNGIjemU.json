  "lyrics": "One more waster digging holes\r\nDown where the streets are paved with souls\r\nIt makes it harder to join the dots\r\nThe river gets wider in front of us\r\nThe last train will pull you through\n\nAt night the war still comes to you\n\nIt makes it harder to join the dots\n\nThe river gets wider in front of us\n\n\n\nBaby we're nothing but violence\n\nDesperate, so desperate and fearless\n\nMess me around until my heart breaks\n\nI just need to feel it\n\nBaby we're nothing but violence\n\nDesperate, so desperate feelings\n\nDesperate and fearless\n\n\n\nThe last train will leave [?]\n\nAt night the war still comes to you\n\nIt makes it harder to join the dots\n\nThe river gets wider from two [?]\n\n\n\nBaby we're nothing but violence\n\nDesperate, so desperate and fearless\n\nMess me around until my heart breaks\n\nI just need to feel it\n\nBaby we're nothing but violence\n\nDesperate, so desperate feelings\n\nDesperate and fearless\n\nViolence",
