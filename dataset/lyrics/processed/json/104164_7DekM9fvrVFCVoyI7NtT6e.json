  "lyrics": "Where do we go from here?\r\nThis isn't where we intended to be\r\nWe had it all, you believed in me\r\nI believed in you\r\nCertainties disappear\n\nWhat do we do for our dreams to survive?\n\nHow do we keep all our passions alive\n\nAs we used to do?\n\n\n\nDeep in my heart, I'm concealing\n\nThings that I'm longing to say\n\nScared to confess, what I'm feeling\n\nFrightened you'll slip away\n\nYou must love me, you must love me\n\n\n\nWhy are you at my side?\n\nHow can I be, any use to you now?\n\nGive me a chance, and I'll let you see how\n\nNothing has changed\n\n\n\nDeep in my heart, I'm concealing\n\nThings that I'm longing to say\n\nScared to confess, what I'm feeling\n\nFrightened you'll slip away\n\nYou must love me, you must love me\n\nYou must love me",
