  "lyrics": "I called U yesterday, U didn't answer your phone\r\nThe main drag is knowing that U probably weren't alone\r\nSo here I sit in my lonely room lookin' 4 my sunshine\r\nBut all I've got is 2 cigarettes and this broken heart of mine \nCHORUS:\n\nSo let the rain come down, the rain come down\n\nLet the rain come down, down\n\nLet the rain come down, the rain come down\n\nLet the rain come down, down \n\n\n\nU've been gone 17 days and 17 long nights\n\nThe main drag is knowing that U're holding someone else tight\n\nI wanna call U every day and beg U 2 be near me\n\nBut I know your head is under water, I doubt that U could hear me \n\n\n\nCHORUS \n\n\n\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha\n\n17 days\n\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha\n\n17 days \n\n\n\nI called U yesterday\n\nU didn't answer your phone\n\nYet, U're the one who's always lonely\n\nBut I'm the one who's always alone \n\n\n\nHere I sit in my lonely room lookin' 4 my sunshine\n\nAll I've got is 2 cigarettes and this broken heart of mine \n\n\n\nCHORUS {repeat} \n\n\n\nWhy don't U answer your phone, babe? {fade out} \n\n\n\n(17 days) {x2}",
