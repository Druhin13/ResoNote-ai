  "lyrics": "In his veins, his blood flow\r\nTo the centre of his soul\r\nIt boils into breeding\r\nWarmth that needs receiving\r\nHere is a warning for you\n\nFalling out, falling out, falling out\n\nOf love\n\nOf love\n\n\n\n\n\nTo and from, high and low\n\nTransient times, tidal flow\n\nA strain on your body\n\nDraining the soul\n\n\n\nHere is a warning for you\n\nFalling out, falling out, falling out\n\nOf love\n\n\n\nHere is a warning for you\n\nFalling out, falling out, falling out\n\nOf love\n\n\n\nRapids of blood will flow\n\nFeeding the urge, he grows\n\nOf all my desire\n\nBut our time is up now",
