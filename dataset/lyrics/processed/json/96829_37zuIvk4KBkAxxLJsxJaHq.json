  "lyrics": "True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree\r\nWillow dancin' on air before covering me\r\nUnder garden and calicos\r\nOver canopy dabbled long ago\r\nTrue that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me\r\nThat the sound of the saw must be known by the tree\n\nMust be felt 'fore the fight, the call\n\nFriendly fire, but that was long ago\n\n\n\nBut that's not tonight (Oh, oh)\n\nWhen I'm set alight (Oh, oh)\n\nAnd I blink inside (Oh, oh)\n\nYour blinding light (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, that's not tonight (Oh, oh)\n\nWhen you hold me tight (Oh, oh)\n\nAll the fire bright (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, hope that you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)\n\nHope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)\n\n\n\nWith the war of the fire, my heart moves to its feet\n\nLike the ashes of ash, I saw eyes in the heat\n\nFeel it soft and as pure as snow\n\nFell in love with the fire long ago\n\nWith each love I could lose, I was never the same\n\nWatch it still live in roofs, be consumed by the flame\n\nI was fixed on your hand of gold\n\nLay in waste of my lovin' long ago\n\n\n\nBut that's not tonight (Oh, oh)\n\nWhen I'm set alight (Oh, oh)\n\nAnd I blink inside (Oh, oh)\n\nYour blinding light (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, that's not tonight (Oh, oh)\n\nWhen you hold me tight (Oh, oh)\n\nAll the fire bright (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, hope that you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)\n\nHope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)\n\n\n\nSo in awe there I stood as you licked off the grain\n\nThough I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame\n\nLong as amber of ember glows\n\nAll the wood that I'd loved is long ago\n\n\n\nAnd that's not tonight (Oh, oh)\n\nWhen I'm set alight (Oh, oh)\n\nAnd I blink inside (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, your blinding light (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, that's not tonight (Oh, oh)\n\nWhen you hold me tight (Oh, oh)\n\nAll the fire bright (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)\n\nHope you're good to me, hope you're good to me (Oh, oh)\n\nHope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)\n\nOh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh)\n\nHope that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)",
