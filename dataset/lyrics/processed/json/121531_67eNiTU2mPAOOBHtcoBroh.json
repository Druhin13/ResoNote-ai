  "lyrics": "I was drivin' to town and I passed by a house\r\nThe one with pillars on the porch\r\nHad a sign on the door said \"for sale\"\r\nSo what the hell\r\nI walked in, and sat down on some strangers couch\r\nSolid Oak Hardwood floors\n\nDidn't need to see more\n\n'Cause I could hear you in the kitchen\n\nPlayin' your guitar\n\nAll our friends coming over\n\nLittle lights in the yard\n\n\n\nAnd dammit\n\nDidn't we almost have it?\n\nHonestly, I still don't understand it\n\nWe used to love to sit and talk and wish\n\nAnd picture and planin'\n\nMan, now I just...dammit\n\n\n\nI think the owners could tell I was lost in myself\n\nSo they left me alone, said \"make yourself right at home\"\n\nI was already makin' dinner\n\nCallin' you down the stairs\n\nLittle girl out the window\n\nHear her laughin' out there\n\n\n\nDammit\n\nDidn't we almost have it?\n\nHonestly, I still don't understand it\n\nWe used to love to sit and talk and wish\n\nAnd picture and planin'\n\nMan now, I just...dammit\n\nBaby, didn't we almost have it?\n\nHonestly, I still don't understand it\n\nWe used to love to sit, talk and wish\n\nAnd picture and plan it\n\nMan, now I just... dammit\n\n\n\nNow I'm driving away\n\nThinking \"oh, what a shame\"\n\nYou can pray, you can hope\n\nBut you just never know\n\nI guess that two bedroom picket fence magic\n\nCan't ever be ours now, can it?\n\n(Dammit)\n\n\n\nOoh\n\nHonestly, I still don't understand it\n\nThinking how could we, coulda had it\n\nWe coulda had it\n\nDammit",
