  "lyrics": "Got a pack of cigarettes\r\n25 in a deck\r\nDon't you know this shit is not gonna solve your problems\r\nWhy don't you take a breath\r\nWhy don't we take a step closer to the edge my dear\r\nDon't you see my thoughts are drowning in the unclear\n\n\n\nI got a penny for your thoughts\n\nI got a dollar for the doubts\n\nI got a message for the lovers\n\nI got a message for myself\n\nI got a different point of view\n\nDiving in the deep blue sky\n\nSee I found myself sitting there when I was getting high\n\n\n\nI'm on a permanent vacation to the soul\n\nAnd I don't feel like working my\n\nFingers to the bone\n\nAnd I fly like the bird\n\nAbove all of the bullshit\n\nAnd I’m looking down on myself\n\nTo start all of the good shit\n\nAnd I know, I know, I know it's coming my way\n\nAnd I know, I know, I know it's coming my way\n\n\n\nI know sometimes\n\nWhen it’s raining down on me\n\nAnd I wish that I could unsee somethings\n\nThat I didn’t wanna see, no\n\nYou're not gonna be the one to mould my ego, no no\n\nI'd rather leave my bags at the door and let it all go\n\n\n\nI got a penny for your thoughts\n\nI got a dollar for the doubts\n\nI got a message for the lovers\n\nI got a message for myself\n\nAnd don't you know I got a different point of view\n\nDiving in the deep blue sky\n\nSee I\n\nFound myself sitting there when I was getting high\n\n\n\nI'm on a permanent vacation to the soul\n\nAnd I don't feel like working my\n\nFingers to the bone\n\nAnd I fly like the bird\n\nAbove all of the bullshit\n\nAnd I’m looking down on myself\n\nTo start all of the good shit\n\nAnd I know, I know, I know it's coming my way\n\nAnd I know, I know, I know it's coming my way",
