  "lyrics": "Heard your voice from the balcony\r\nI started looking for the closest way out\r\nTo get by without meeting you\r\nHeard my name, someone telling you\r\nI'm standing right outside the door on your right\r\nAin't no time for a good excuse\n\n\n\nDidn't know you would be looking like the best I'd ever had\n\nDidn't know that I would feel like every time you move like that\n\nWalk into the room, and I can't refuse ya\n\nDidn't know that we would meet up, feeling like four years never passed\n\n\n\nFor a minute, you thought you fooled me\n\nFor a minute, you got me lost\n\nFor a second, I thought you loved me\n\nBut just when the music stopped\n\nWell, your last boy left you in a hurry\n\nWhen I'm close to you, everything is blurry\n\nFor a second, I thought you loved me\n\nFor a second, I forgot\n\nI forgot\n\n\n\nI think I might still remember your taste\n\nBut if I don't, can you please remind me?\n\n'Cause I miss how I used to feel\n\nNow, you and I, dancing face to face\n\nAnd the other people fade away\n\nIf we stop, I'm afraid you'll leave\n\n\n\nDidn't know you would be looking like the best I'd ever had\n\nDidn't know that we would meet up, feeling like four years never passed\n\n\n\nFor a minute, you thought you fooled me\n\nFor a minute, you got me lost\n\nFor a second, I thought you loved me\n\nBut just when the music stopped\n\nWell, your last boy left you in a hurry\n\nWhen I'm close to you, everything is blurry\n\nFor a second, I thought you loved me\n\nFor a second, I forgot\n\n\n\nI forgot\n\nI forgot\n\nI forgot\n\nI forgot\n\n\n\nForgot why you left in the first place\n\nForgot why you left with a notice\n\nIt was easier that way\n\n\n\nI forgot (For a minute, for a second)\n\nI forgot (You think just nothing happened)\n\nI forgot\n\nI forgot",
