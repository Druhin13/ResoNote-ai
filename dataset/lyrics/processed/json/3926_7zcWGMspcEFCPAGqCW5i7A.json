  "lyrics": "Son of river man, muddy water's all I've known\r\nI was born out on the banks, Mama died when I was young\r\nJust before my daddy left, he hollered out at me\r\n\"Son you're a child of the Mississippi\"\r\nMy schoolin' was a steamboat, and I was educated well\r\nOn a sternin' double wheeler, where I learned my rebel yell\n\nThen I started roustaboutin' at the age of thirteen\n\nLord, I'm a child of the Mississippi\n\n\n\nI was raised on the river, muddy water gonna carry me home\n\nShe's gonna rock me like a baby rollin' in her sweet lovin' arms\n\nJust a barefoot boy born in in Dixieland\n\nBrought up on the banks to be a river man\n\nSweet child of the Mississippi\n\n\n\nI know every stretch of river, I know every railroad bridge\n\nFrom up in St. Paul Minnesota, down south to the Memphis pyramid\n\nLord she's [?] and lonesome, and I've known since I was a kid\n\nI was a child of the Mississippi\n\n\n\nI was raised on the river, muddy water gonna carry me home\n\nShe's gonna rock me like a baby rollin' in her sweet lovin' arms\n\nJust a barefoot boy born in in Dixieland\n\nBrought up on the banks to be a river man\n\nSweet child of the Mississippi\n\n\n\nWell I sure miss my mama, and I even miss ol' Pa\n\nBut I love that muddy water most of all\n\n\n\nI was raised on the river, muddy water gonna carry me home\n\nShe's gonna rock me like a baby rollin' in her sweet lovin' arms\n\nI was a barefoot boy born in in Dixieland\n\nBrought up on the banks to be a river man\n\nSweet child of the Mississippi\n\nSweet child of the Mississippi\n\nSweet child of the Mississippi\n\nSweet child of the Mississippi",
