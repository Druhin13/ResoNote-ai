I've still got some questions\nStill fightin' attention, I need some relief\nNo, I'm no Superman, this is my confession\nBeen learnin' my lesson, help me understand\n\nSo won't You make my eyes Your eyes\nMy ears Your ears, my tears Your tears\nAnd won't you make my hands Your hands\nMy feet Your feet, my dreams Your dreams\n\nI give up control, oh, oh whoa\nBody, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa\nCan't do this on my own, no, no\nI give up control\n\nI will raise my voice and sing\nI will, I will raise my voice and sing\n\nIt's all I've got left to bring\nI will, I will raise my voice and sing\nI will raise my voice and sing\nI will, I will raise my voice and sing, yeah\nIt's all I've got left to bring\nI will, I will raise my voice and sing\n\nI give up control\nI give up control, oh, oh whoa\nBody, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa\nCan't do this on my own, no, no\nI give up control\nOh, give up control, oh, oh whoa\nMy body, mind, and soul, oh, oh whoa\nI can't do this on my own, no, no\nI give up control\n\nOh, I give up control\n\n(Ooh)\n(Ooh)",
