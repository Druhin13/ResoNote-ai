  "lyrics": "I never had a crystal ball\r\nI never had a crystal stone\r\nI never claimed to know it all\r\nAll I know is what I've known\r\nBut I know that what we've had\r\nI have never had before\n\nAnd if you really have to go\n\nBe of good heart evermore\n\n\n\nI hear the wild dog in the dark\n\nI hear the wind out in the pines\n\nBut there's no travel near or far\n\nWithout the crossing of my mind\n\nStill the reflection of your eyes\n\nShows a road stretched out before\n\nAnd if you really have to go\n\nBe of good heart evermore\n\n\n\nI don't know nothing bout where you're goin\n\nThat don't mean a thing to me\n\nYou have secrets I don't know\n\nAnd I have scars that you can't read\n\nI know your past ain't far behind\n\nI hear it knocking on the door\n\nSo if you really have to go\n\nBe of good heart evermore\n\n\n\nAnd I know that I just may\n\nHave been a way to pass your time\n\nJust a stop along your way\n\nAs you were a stop on mine\n\nBut even so it'd still be worth\n\nAll the loneliness in store\n\nSo if you really gotta go\n\nBe of good heart evermore\n\n\n\nBe of good heart evermoreâ€¦",
