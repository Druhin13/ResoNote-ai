  "lyrics": "I got kicked off Noah's Ark\r\nI turn my cheek to unkind remarks\r\nThere was two of everything\r\nBut one of me\r\nAnd when the rains came tumbling down\r\nI held my breath and I stood my ground\n\nAnd I watched that ship go sailing\n\nOut to sea.\n\n\n\nTake it back\n\nTake it back\n\nOh no, you can't say that\n\nAll of my friends\n\nAre not dead or in jail\n\nThrough rock and through stone\n\nThe black wind still moans\n\nSweet revenge\n\nSweet revenge\n\nWithout fail.\n\n\n\nI caught an aisle seat on a plane\n\nAnd drove an English teacher half insane\n\nMaking up jokes about bicycle spokes\n\nAnd red balloons\n\nSo I called up my local deejay\n\nAnd he didn't have a lot to say\n\nBut the radio\n\nHas learned all of my favorite tunes.\n\n\n\nTake it back\n\nTake it back\n\nOh no, you can't say that\n\nAll of my friends\n\nAre not dead or in jail\n\nThrough rock and through stone\n\nThe black wind still moans\n\nSweet revenge\n\nSweet revenge\n\nWithout fail.\n\n\n\nThe white meat is on the run\n\nAnd the dark meat is far too done\n\nAnd the milkman left me a note yesterday\n\nGet out of this town by noon\n\nYou're coming on way too soon\n\nAnd besides that\n\nWe never liked you any way.\n\n\n\nTake it back\n\nTake it back\n\nOh no, you can't say that\n\nAll of my friends\n\nAre not dead or in jail\n\nThrough rock and through stone\n\nThe black wind still moans\n\nSweet revenge\n\nSweet revenge\n\nWithout fail.",
