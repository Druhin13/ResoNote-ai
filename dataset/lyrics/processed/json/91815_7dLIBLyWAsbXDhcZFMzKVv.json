  "lyrics": "Your cage is what you make it\r\nIf you decorate it\r\nIt goes back faster\r\nGoes quick, laughter\r\nPermeates the carnage\r\nLaying out in sunlight\n\nAt daybreak oh, daybreak oh\n\n\n\nYou look cute in plastic\n\nMy existence drastic\n\nAnd lake of flowers\n\nBurning flowers\n\nTry to make it faster\n\nCrayons in the laughter\n\nA scream of gel\n\nPatient hell\n\n\n\nCall it what you want, dear\n\nI call it fear\n\nAnd I am an expert\n\nLaying out brick by brick\n\nCall it what you need to\n\nI left behind reason\n\nFaith I take, faith I take",
