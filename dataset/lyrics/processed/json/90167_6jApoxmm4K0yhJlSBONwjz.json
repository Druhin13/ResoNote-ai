  "lyrics": "I got so much to say but I can't find the voice\r\nI been thinking about it like I had a choice\r\nAll I want is you, for you to want me too\r\nI can't believe you ever looked\r\nMe in the eyes\r\nI been trying to live inside another life\n\nAll I want is you, for you to want me too\n\nThere's a ghost in my home and it just won't go\n\nAnd it plays with my mind when I'm on my own\n\nNow I'm here on the other side\n\nLooking out for a guided light\n\nThere's a ghost in my home\n\nAnd it just won't go\n\nI guess it wasn't the right time to show your face\n\nTell me, why did you come\n\nHere just to go away?\n\nIt's not natural, for you to watch me fall\n\nAt the tone, I left you all my messages\n\nWon't somebody please tell\n\nMe what the story is?\n\nI just wanted you\n\nFor you to want me too\n\nThere's a ghost in my home and it just won't go\n\nAnd it plays with my mind when I'm on my own\n\nNow I'm here on the other side\n\nLooking out for a guided light\n\nThere's a ghost in my home and it just won't go\n\nThere's a ghost in my home and it just won't go\n\nAnd it plays with my mind when I'm on my own\n\nNow I'm here in the waiting room\n\nHolding on to the thought of you\n\nThere's a ghost in my home and it just won't go\n\nOh, I feel so cold in this losing world\n\nOh, I feel so cold in this losing world\n\nOh, I feel so cold in this lonely world",
