  "lyrics": "Sixteen years looking up at the blackboard\r\nI don't even know how to read\r\nI got pills to make the hamster wheels turn faster\r\nBut the monkey's in the driver's seat\r\nAnd now I tear myself apart about everything at once\r\nI miss my good old lack of self esteem\n\nYou can take out the wax and tie me to the mast\n\nI gotta hear the sirens scream\n\nDon't listen to me\n\nI just need a good night's sleep\n\n\n\nAnd you keep me up all night\n\nCan't talk right\n\nI'm falling into my clothes\n\nAnd even though I'm feeling like death\n\nI can't be upset\n\n'Cause I finally know\n\n\n\nYou can document the teenage wildlife\n\nPsychoanalyze the modern man\n\nYou can classify 'em all by bloodtype\n\nBut you're never gonna understand\n\nWhat if panic were the right reaction\n\nTo the anno domini milieu\n\nI'm too sleepy for the main distraction\n\nDowntown lights could never glow like you\n\nI'm going to sleep\n\n\n\nAnd then you keep me up all night\n\nCan't talk right\n\nI'm falling into my clothes\n\nAnd even though I'm feeling like death\n\nI can't be upset\n\n'Cause I finally know\n\n\n\nI don't want to be an animal (oh no)\n\nBut you're making this hard for me\n\nBut I don't want to be an animal (oh no)\n\nBut you don't wanna go\n\n\n\n[guitar solo]\n\n\n\nAnd you keep me up all night\n\nCan't talk right\n\nI'm falling into my clothes\n\nAnd even though I'm feeling like death\n\nI can't be upset\n\n'Cause I finally know\n\nI finally know\n\nI finally know\n\nI finally know\n\nI finally know",
