  "lyrics": "See the writing pon the wall\r\nTo those who think they're fit come judge us all\r\nBut they don't know\r\nHow my people cry Oh dear sufferah \nAnd all and all of dem claim that it is the end yes\r\nBut they will never know\n\nFor in their heart is only gold\n\n\n\nAnd what they know ...\n\nIs what dem saying is the right\n\nWhile all along ...\n\nThey shield themselves off from the light\n\nBut hand in hand ...\n\nWe await the rising sun\n\nWe free people will unite\n\nAnd come to chant them down!\n\n\n\nIt takes a weak heart to judge one another\n\nIt takes a weak heart to judge those who suffer (2X)\n\nWanting! Crying! Wanting! Crying!\n\n\n\nDream comes to me in shadows\n\nOf a weak heart beating shallow\n\nBut you think you're better than the best\n\nNow you think you're tougher than the rest\n\nWell I'm here to tell you man you are only a Human\n\nNot fit to judge who lives and who dies\n\nLess you be judged by the Most High\n\n\n\nNo Weak Heart ... Shall enter! \n\nNo Weak Heart ... Shall enter! (2X)",
