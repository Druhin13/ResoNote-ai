  "lyrics": "I remember when it hit me\r\nYou were 19, bright eyes, big dreams\r\nI felt the blood rush to my heart\r\nI knew that this could be the start of something\r\nLike you see in movies\r\nThe making of our story\n\nSo I got down on my knee\n\nAnd I told you honestly\n\n\n\nBaby, I don't know where we're going\n\nBut we're going together\n\n\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nOooh, oooh\n\n\n\nFast forward 8 years later\n\nWe're on this wild adventure\n\nGot a baby in the back seat\n\nMoving to another country\n\nWe packed up every last thing\n\nTurned the chapter in this story\n\nBoth of us scared to death\n\nYou took my hand and said\n\n\n\nBaby, I don't know where we're going\n\nBut we're going together\n\n\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nWe're going together\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nWe're going together\n\n\n\nThrough the unknown\n\nUntil we get home\n\nWe will hold onto each other\n\n'Cause this love we share\n\nIs an answered prayer\n\nAnd it's only getting better\n\n\n\nI can see us when we're older\n\nAnd moving a little slower\n\nWith a life full of memories\n\nYeah, we wouldn't change a thing\n\nAnd it might not come easy\n\nBut the beauty is the mystery\n\nOf where this road leads\n\nYou and me\n\n\n\nBaby, I don't know where we're going\n\nBut we're going together\n\n\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nWe're going together\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nWe're going together (I remember when it hit me)\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nWe're going together (I remember when it hit me)\n\nOooh, oooh\n\nWe're going together",
