Yeah...\n\n\n\nI know\n\nYou've been hurt but so have I\n\nSo don't\n\nLet it get in the way cause it feels so\n\nLet go\n\nCause what we got is ours tonight\n\nLets take tonight, take tonight\n\nCause I've been patient\n\nCause I don't wanna be that girl that gets all desperate\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nDo you love me, do you love me\n\nDo you love me like I do?\n\nCan you feel it, can you feel it\n\nWhen my body's next to you?\n\nBaby just whisper in my ear\n\nTell me those words you need to hear\n\nDo you love me, do you love me\n\nCause I'm standing right here\n\nDo you? Yeah...\n\n\n\nCause I've been patient\n\nDon't wanna be that girl that gets so desperate\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nDo you love me, do you love me\n\nDo you love me like I do?\n\nCan you feel it, can you feel it\n\nWhen my body's next to you?\n\nBaby just whisper in my ear\n\nTell me those words I need to hear\n\nDo you love me, do you love me\n\nCause I'm standing right here\n\nDo you?
