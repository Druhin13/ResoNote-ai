  "lyrics": "I'm ridin' my thumb uptown for to find me a score\r\nThere's a Manitoba man behind the fillin' station store\r\nMan, he's got stuff that leaves every limb singin' for more\r\nSo I'm ridin' my thumb uptown for to find me a score\r\nMy good gal stood by me and I know she's the light of my life\n\nBut if I am to be truthful, I don't feel alive 'til it's night\n\nWhen the hours I'm alone in the dark are the only in sight\n\nMy good gal stood by me and I know she's the light of my life\n\n\n\nMy time is past due and I ought to be movin' along\n\nI've been kickin' my feet, wanderin' these streets for too long\n\nMy good gal, she tells me she's dreamin' of raisin' a son\n\nMy time is past due, I ought to be movin' along\n\n\n\nI reckon I'll make one last stop before I go\n\nHe's waitin' for me at the pumps, surely he knows\n\nThat twenty-four hours have passed since I last powdered my nose\n\nSo I reckon I'll make one last stop before I go",
