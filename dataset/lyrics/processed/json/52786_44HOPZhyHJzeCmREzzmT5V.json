  "lyrics": "Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.\nIt's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.\nMy luck is changing, it's gotten from \nsimply rotten to something worse\nWho knows, some day I will win too. \nI'll begin to reach my prime.\n\n\n\nNow though I see what our end is,\n\nAll I can spend is just my time.\n\n\n\nI can't give you anything but love, baby.\n\nThat's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.\n\n\n\nDream awhile, scheme awhile\n\nWe're sure to find\n\n\n\nHappiness and I guess\n\nAll those things you've always pined for.\n\n\n\nGee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.\n\nDiamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.\n\n\n\nTill that lucky day you know darned well, baby.\n\nI can't give you anything but love.\n\n\n\nRome wasn't built in a day, kid.\n\nYou have to pay, kid, for what you get.\n\nBut I am willing to wait, dear, \n\nYour little mate, dear, will not forget.\n\n\n\nYou have a lifetime before you.\n\nI'll adore you, come what may.\n\n\n\nPlease don't be blue for the present, \n\nWhen it's so pleasant to hear you say\n\n\n\nI can't give you anything but love, baby.\n\nThat's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.\n\n\n\nDream awhile, scheme awhile\n\nWe're sure to find\n\n\n\nHappiness and I guess\n\nAll those things you've always pined for.\n\n\n\nGee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.\n\nDiamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.\n\n\n\nTill that lucky day you know darned well, baby.\n\nI can't give you anything but love.",
