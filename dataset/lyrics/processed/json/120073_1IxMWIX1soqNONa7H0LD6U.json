  "lyrics": "I'd promise you forever if I could\r\nIf I could slow down the hands of time I would\r\nI know they say all good things must end\r\nIf I could do it all over I would do it all over\r\nOver and over again\n\nWe'll go on 'til were pushin' up daisies\n\nWe'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby\n\nWe'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die\n\nNaw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive\n\n\n\n'Til I held you close I never felt the feelin'\n\nAnd now I'll feel that way 'til the last sunset goes down\n\nYou turned a stubborn southern boy into a believer\n\nBelieve me when I say, \"It's gonna stay that way 'til they lay me in the ground\"\n\n\n\nWe'll go on 'til we're pushing up daisies\n\nWe'll grow old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby\n\nWe'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die\n\nNaw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive\n\n\n\nWe'll go on 'til were pushing up daisies\n\nWe'll be old and wild and I'll still be callin' you baby\n\nWe'll never get enough, we'll be livin' it up right down to the day we die\n\nNaw, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive\n\n\n\nWhen our last breath is gone\n\nAnd they carve our name in stone\n\nOh, we ain't gettin' out of this love alive",
