  "lyrics": "Turn on the lights I think I'm losing strength\r\nI'll wait forever till it all make sense to me\r\nThe room is spinning while I'm standing still\r\nI need a remedy to lift me up\r\nUntil it all falls back just like you said\n\nMy heart's not built for bitterness\n\nI'm on the last train home, need to clear head\n\nAnd think aloud what's to dream\n\n\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nBut I think it's wherever we are\n\nYou know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nI know it won't tear us apart\n\nYou know I've got a lot to say\n\nDon't you run away or stay in reverie, in reverie\n\n\n\nCongratulations, I'm a wreck again\n\nMessed around, feeling down, thought it was all pretend\n\nI'm realising I've got time to kill show\n\nGive me a remedy to lift me up\n\n\n\nUntil it all falls back just like you said\n\nMy heart's not built for bitterness\n\nI'm on the last train home, need to clear head\n\nAnd think aloud what's to dream\n\n\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nBut I think it's wherever we are\n\nYou know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nI know it won't tear us apart\n\nYou know I've got a lot to say\n\nDon't you run away or stay in reverie, in reverie\n\n\n\nLet's rewrite the part where everything goes to hell for me\n\nOut of spite\n\nI'm taking one last chance to find my sanity\n\n\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nBut I think it's wherever we are\n\nYou know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts\n\n\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nBut I think it's wherever we are\n\nYou know I'll be patient despite our racing hearts\n\nThey said we could find safe haven\n\nI know it won't tear us apart\n\nYou know I've got a lot to say\n\nDon't you run away or stay in reverie, in reverie",
