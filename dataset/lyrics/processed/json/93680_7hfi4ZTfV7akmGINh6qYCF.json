  "lyrics": "When all the worst we fear lifts all its weight\r\nWhen the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks\r\nWhen St. Peter loses cool and bars the Gates\r\nWhen Atlas acts so mad it makes his arms shake\r\nWhen the birds are heard again and they're singing\r\nOnce atrocity is hoarse from voicing shame\n\nAnd when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'\n\nWith the same sweet shock of when Adam first came\n\n\n\nBe, be, be, be\n\nBe as you've always been\n\nBe, be, be, be\n\nBe as you've always been (lover, be good to me)\n\n\n\nBe as you've always been (lover, be good to me)\n\nBe like the love that discovered sin (lover, be good to me)\n\nBut freed the first man and will do so again\n\nAnd lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)\n\nBe that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (lover, be good to me)\n\nThat's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (lover, be good to me)\n\nWhich side of the war will suffer that cost?\n\nOh lover, be good to me\n\n\n\nWhen the man who gives the order\n\nIs born next time around on the boat sent back\n\nWhen the body is starvin' at the border\n\nOr on TV giving people the sack\n\nLord, when the sea rises to meet us\n\nOh and there's nothing left for you and I to do\n\nOh when there's nobody upstairs to receive us\n\nWhen I have no kind words left, love for you now\n\n\n\nBe, be, be, be\n\nBe as you've always been\n\nBe, be, be, be\n\nBe as you've always been (lover, be good to me)\n\n\n\nBe love in its disrepute (lover, be good to me)\n\nScorches the hillside and salts every root (lover, be good to me)\n\nAnd watches the slowing and starving of troops\n\nAnd lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)\n\nBe there, in your stairs you stay (lover, be good to me)\n\nBe like the rose that you hold in your hand (lover, be good to me)\n\nThat will grow bold in a barren and desolate land\n\nOh lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)\n\n\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nBe as you've always been?\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nBe as you've always been?\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nBe as you've always been?\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nLove won't you be,\n\nBe as you've always been?\n\n\n\n(Lover, be good to me)",
