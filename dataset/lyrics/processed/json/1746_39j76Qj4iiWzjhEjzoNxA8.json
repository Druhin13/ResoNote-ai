  "lyrics": "I wanted to be with you alone\r\nAnd talk about the weather\r\nBut traditions I can trace against the child in your face\r\nWon't escape my attention\r\nYou keep your distance with a system of touch\r\nAnd gentle persuasion\n\nI'm lost in admiration could I need you this much\n\nOh, you're wasting my time\n\nYou're just wasting time\n\n\n\nSomething happens and I'm head over heels\n\nI never find out till I'm head over heels\n\nSomething happens and I'm head over heels\n\nAh don't take my heart\n\nDon't break my heart\n\nDon't throw it away\n\nI made a fire and watching burn\n\nThought of your future\n\nWith one foot in the past now just how long will it last\n\nNo no no have you no ambition\n\n\n\nMy mother and my brothers used to breathe in clean air\n\nAnd dreaming I'm a doctor\n\nIt's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand\n\nOh I feel so...\n\n\n\nSomething happens and I'm head over heels\n\nAnd this my four leaf clover\n\nI'm on the line, one open mind\n\nThis is my four leaf clover\n\nIn my mind's eye\n\nOne little boy walking by\n\nFunny how time flies.",
