  "lyrics": "One shine like an oil spill\r\nOr rainbow and cartwheels\r\nA dirty coin in the snow\r\nGo fly like a kite\r\nIn the wind and you might\r\nNot ever come down or come home\n\n\n\n'Cause if life is an ocean\n\nThen love is an island\n\nAnd freedom is a boat you can row\n\n\n\nSo let's go, ah, yeah\n\n\n\nOh, take a chance if it feels right\n\nDance 'neath the street lights\n\nGet drunk and howl up at the moon\n\nSing loud and sing strong\n\nSing all the words wrong\n\nWe sing your own tune\n\n\n\n'Cause if life is a journey\n\nThen love is a sign post\n\nAnd freedom's a fork in the road\n\n\n\nSo let's go, ah, yeah\n\nLet's go, ah, yeah\n\n\n\nSo go on sprinkle like starlight\n\nLike Christmas and car lights\n\nLike gold on an old wedding rings\n\nThat your grandmother gave when she\n\nPassed away, to teach you\n\nPeople were more precious than things\n\nHey, hey, hey\n\n\n\nSo maybe just one time\n\nLay 'neath the sunshine\n\nSee the faces and shapes in the clouds\n\nGo out in the rain like a runaway train\n\nAnd run till the road runs out\n\n\n\nLive life, don't dream it\n\nLove like you mean it\n\nBeing free as the river that flows\n\n\n\nLet's go, ah, yeah, yeah\n\nLet's go, ah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah, oh",
