  "lyrics": "Yeah, how could you be so careless?\r\nI sweat this, I swear\r\nYou think I'm losing my voice, I took no time to take care\r\nI smashed my phone, but honestly I feel relieved\r\nYou can't reach me, no, I can exhale on my own\n\nWhat were you thinking? That night was a dream\n\nAt the top of your lungs, I've heard you scream in your sleep\n\nAnd I know you don't mean a thing, just get lost in translation\n\nSo, how much is enough gonna say? Yeah\n\n\n\nI've got a noble for it, that cold is breaking, yeah\n\nI've got a lover, baby, don't need what you're giving me\n\nMore than what you think of love\n\nAin't love, I'm feeling love, but\n\nIt's screaming, yeah\n\n\n\nI've said it all\n\nI thought maybe you believed me, 'cause I don't\n\nThese days it's a clich√©, I know\n\nBut, no weapons, no words\n\n\n\nAnd if I could forget you, you know I would leave\n\nI can't help myself from feeling all, this is wasted on me\n\nAnd I love the rain (love!), but I can't live in a storm\n\nI got more to go\n\nStill learning to grow\n\n\n\nWhat were you thinking? That night was a dream\n\nAt the top of your lungs, I hear you scream in your sleep\n\nAnd I know you don't mean a thing, I just get lost in translation\n\nSo, how much is enough gonna say?\n\nI got a lifetime to wait",
