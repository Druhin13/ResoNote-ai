  "lyrics": "We ride this heartless road\r\nI curse our song on the radio\r\nWe fly, we flick and float\r\nTurning upside down in the afterglow\r\nShe said, oh\n\nShe don't know\n\nWhere I'll go\n\nWhere will I go\n\n\n\nBut I know\n\nKnow she knows\n\nEvery time\n\nI tell her so\n\n\n\nOh, I have a coat to hold\n\nHer head light and ready to go\n\nTonight, I wake, I know\n\nWe're calling out like we're never alone\n\n\n\nShe said, oh\n\nShe don't know\n\nWhere I'll go\n\nWhere will I go\n\n\n\nBut I know\n\nKnow she knows\n\nEvery time\n\nI tell her so\n\n\n\nI'll go\n\nWhere she goes\n\nEvery time\n\nShe tells me so",
