  "lyrics": "Do you remember what I said\r\nThe night that I just spilled my soul?\r\nI told you things about myself\r\nThings that no one else should know\r\nYou see the thoughts behind my eyes\r\nYou try to ask but you don't pry\n\nWe feel the same but we don't speak\n\nYou cannot make up your mind\n\nThere's always some form of excuse\n\nThere's nothing left for me to prove\n\nI try to hold on cause you know I hate to lose\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the change in me not strong enough?\n\nWas tit something else?\n\nCause I tried my best\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the sober me not good enough?\n\nIs there someone else?\n\nI can't get through to you\n\n\n\nI can't get out of my head\n\nTime with you is what I dread\n\nWhen it's you and me, apparently\n\nI don't seem to phase you\n\nSo I chase you\n\nJust to be shot down, I never break through\n\n\n\nAll these fucked up restless nights\n\nAlways haunt my sleepless mind\n\nOnly trying to survive\n\nBut you won't even look me in my eyes\n\nAlways some form of excuse\n\nThere's nothing left for me to prove\n\nI tried to hold on but I know I need to lose\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the change in me not strong enough?\n\nWas it something else?\n\nCause I tried my best\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the sober me not good enough?\n\nIs there someone else?\n\nI can't get through to you\n\n\n\nI start to think out loud\n\nAnd with every sound, she breaks\n\nWith a shattered soul\n\nShe was the black hole when I roamed space\n\nWhen I roamed space\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the sober me not good enough?\n\nWas it something else?\n\nCause I tried my best\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the sober me not strong enough?\n\nIs it something else?\n\nI can't get through to you\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the change in me not strong enough?\n\nWas it something else?\n\nCause I tried my best\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the sober me not good enough?\n\nIs there someone else?\n\nI can't get through to you\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the change in me not strong enough?\n\nWas it something else?\n\nCause I tried my best\n\nWhat happened to the one I loved?\n\nWas the sober me not good enough?\n\nIs there someone else?\n\nI can't get through to you\n\n\n\nIs there someone else?\n\nI can't get through to you",
