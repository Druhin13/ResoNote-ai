  "lyrics": "With each breath, with each step\r\nI fall a little further from the plans that I have laid\r\nWith each breath, with each step\r\nI feel a little smaller in the bed that I have made\r\nPeople will hate you shake you break you\n\nStanding firm will make you\n\nUnstoppable\n\n\n\nWhen we stumble when we fall\n\nWhen there's nothing left at all\n\nWe get up, we get up, we get up again\n\nWe get up, we get up, we get up again\n\n\n\nWith each breath, with each step\n\nI fly a little closer to the ledge from where I fled\n\nWith each breath, with each step\n\nI feel a little closure from the life that I have led\n\n\n\nWhen the world is caving in\n\nWhen your skin is wearing thin\n\nWe get up, we get up, we get up again\n\nYeah we get up, we get up, we get up again\n\n\n\nAnd now I know how much I can take\n\nHow my bones bend and crack before they break\n\nHow long the night lasts before the day\n\nHow far I need to walk around the world\n\nBefore I start back again\n\n\n\nWhat doesn't kill you makes you stronger\n\nAnd you won't fear death any longer",
