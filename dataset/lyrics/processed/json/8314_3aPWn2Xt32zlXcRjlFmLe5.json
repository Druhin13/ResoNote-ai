  "lyrics": "Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, uh\r\nNothing's ever promised, not reading the comments\r\nA lot of failed rappers pretending they're bloggers\r\nA lot of jealousy if I'm keeping it honest\r\nY'all should blame God for keeping it from you\n\nTen projects and the numbers don't lie\n\nGot signed and really thought it happened overnight\n\nWas working three jobs collecting overtime\n\nStill found time to preach to kids down in Overtown\n\nReally believing what I preached to em'\n\nThey say going mainstream is the key to em'\n\nBut I just make music, there's no limits to it\n\nI've seen the lives changed, talking me included\n\nWhen God's involved, there is no way you can stop it\n\nThey said that Christian thing wasn't for the market\n\nUntil they saw that bus now they wanna open\n\nMaybe we got lucky or maybe we chosen\n\n\n\nMaybe we got lucky\n\nMaybe we're just lucky\n\nMaybe we got lucky\n\nMaybe we're just lucky\n\n\n\nWhen the plane starts shaking all I do is start writing\n\nNobody can question God's will\n\nVintage like I'm Tom Hill\n\nThats Tommy Hilfiger you ain't caught on still\n\nFrom the golden era, but I'm hot still\n\nSurvived it you can't say that I'm not trill\n\nNow I'm first class for the times I was dead last\n\nStewardess just gave me the options for my breakfast\n\nI'm Lonzo Ball with the fast break\n\nAlley-oop to MartyMar made the glass break (crash)\n\nShattered board one's just a compliment\n\nA lot of y'all are rapping but it doesn't make sense\n\nJust putting words together, I'm flying over weather\n\n37,000 feet should do it, yeah that's much better\n\nI'm a misfit, you can catch me in all black\n\nNo bandanas with my clothes\n\nFrank Sinatra with my flows\n\nStraight classy , write when I'm in my zone\n\n\n\nMaybe we got lucky\n\nMaybe we're just lucky\n\nMaybe we got lucky\n\nMaybe we're just lucky\n\n\n\nTake a deep breath, I count my blessings\n\nWhen you walked right in to me out of the dark\n\nI can stay right here in this moment forever\n\nMaybe someone lined up the stars\n\nOr\n\n\n\nMaybe we got lucky\n\nMaybe we're just lucky\n\nMaybe we got lucky\n\nMaybe we're just lucky",
