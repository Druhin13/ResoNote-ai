You remember me?\n\nNo, she too special (she too special), woo\n\nShe on a whole 'nother level\n\nTurn on the TV, man, she on the channel\n\nAnd she can play the piano, damn, (uh fuck)\n\nShe the freshest, give her the bust down necklace\n\nShe gave back the necklace, she told me I'm living too reckless fuck\n\nFuck, why you ignoring my message?\n\nShe said \"'Cause I'm working and I don't got time to go check it\"\n\n\n\nShe ahead of me, she ahead of me\n\nGave her everything, gave her everything\n\nShe got better things, yuh, she got better things\n\nShe got better things, she got better things\n\nYou was seventeen, you my everything\n\nWe were heavenly, now she say \"You dead to me\"\n\nShe got better things, she got better things\n\nShe got better things, she got better things\n\n\n\nTop down leather seats, too many fantasies\n\nI'm in Atlanta, jeez, harness my energy\n\nShe got, woah, she got, woah\n\nShe got, woah, she got, woah\n\nWe're not enemies, see these diamond rings\n\nYou need ten of these, and she just let it be\n\nShe got better things (damn, yuh, huh, woah)",
