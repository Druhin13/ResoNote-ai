(What do you want, babe?)\n\nI don't like when you taunt me (I don't like when you taunt me)\n\nYou've been calling the wrong line (you've been calling the wrong line)\n\nI say who do you want, babe? (Who do you want, babe?)\n\nI'm working on my name (working on my name)\n\nI'm hoping you do the same (do the same)\n\nYou got me afraid again (got me afraid again)\n\nSo let me just pray again (so let me just pray again)\n\n\n\nYou're gonna jump through hoops\n\nKnow how many lines you drew\n\nNo matter when you lose\n\nEverything I've done for you\n\n\n\nShe don't wanna tell lies\n\nShe don't wanna tell lies\n\nShe just wanna feel alive\n\nShe just wanted more time\n\nI'm looking for a long ride\n\nShe just want a test drive (what do you want, babe?)\n\nNow you go the west side (what do you want, babe?)\n\nI'll see you in the next life (who do you want, babe?)\n\n\n\nWaiting on a sacrificial life\n\nWaiting on the ones who didn't fight\n\nI told you not to waste my fucking time\n\nI told you never sing that song you like\n\n\n\nYou're gonna jump through hoops\n\nKnow how many lines you drew\n\nNo matter when you lose\n\nEverything I've done for you\n\n\n\nShe don't wanna tell lies (she don't wanna tell lies)\n\nShe don't wanna tell lies (she don't wanna tell lies)\n\nShe just wanna feel alive (she just wanna feel alive)\n\nShe just wanted more time (she just wanted more time)\n\nI'm looking for a long ride (looking for a long ride)\n\nShe just want a test drive (she just want a test drive)\n\nNow you go the west side (now you go the west side)\n\nI'll see you in the next life (see you in the next life)",
