  "lyrics": "White sand, tan skin\r\nRed hot from the beginning\r\nHeartbeats racing\r\nTaste the salt on your lips that I was kissing\r\nThought it would always be that way\n\nTill I felt the seasons change\n\nMaybe we weren't meant to last forever anyway\n\n\n\nJust like a song for the summer\n\nWhen we were young, we never thought it would end\n\nJust getting lost in each other, we'd play it till it's over\n\nThen play it all over again\n\nWe sang along, long, long in the sunshine\n\nAll night, so right till it was gone\n\nJust like a song, song for the summer, song for the summer\n\n\n\nBare feet, low tide\n\nWe were dancing in the water\n\nCool breeze, your eyes\n\nBluer than the sky, losing track of time\n\n\n\nNow every memory, like a melody\n\nI can't get out of my head\n\nEvery single line that you said to me\n\nTakes me right back there\n\n\n\nJust like a song for the summer\n\nWhen we were young, we never thought it would end\n\nJust getting lost in each other, we'd play it till it's over\n\nThen play it all over again\n\nWe sang along, long, long in the sunshine\n\nAll night, so right till it was gone\n\nJust like a song, song for the summer, song for the summer\n\n\n\n(Song for the summer, song for the summer)\n\n(Song for the summer, song for the summer)\n\n\n\nNow every memory, like a melody\n\nI can't get out of my head\n\n\n\nJust like a song for the summer\n\nWhen we were young, we never thought it would end\n\nJust getting lost in each other, we'd play it till it's over\n\nThen play it all over again\n\nWe sang along, long, long in the sunshine\n\nAll night, so right till it was gone\n\nJust like a song, song for the summer, song for the summer\n\n\n\n(Just like a song, song for the summer, song for the summer)\n\n(Just like a song, song for the summer, song for the summer)\n\n\n\nWe were a song, song for the summer",
