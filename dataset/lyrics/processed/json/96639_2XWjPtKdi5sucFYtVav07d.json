(Are you gonna be the one?)\nI want you to be the one\n\nI want you to be the one that's on my mind\nOn my mind, on my mind\nI want you to be there on a Monday night\nTuesday night, every night\n\nAre you gonna be the one that's on my mind?\n365, all the time\nI want you to be the one to stay\nYou give me the night and day\n\nI think about you all the time\n24/7, 365\nI think about you all the time\n24/7, 365",
