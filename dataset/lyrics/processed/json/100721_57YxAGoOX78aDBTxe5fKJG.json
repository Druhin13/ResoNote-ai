  "lyrics": "Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze!\r\nSqueeze my arms a little tighter\r\nLet me know I'm still alive \nCause you're the only one here keeping both my eyes open tonight\r\nAnd I know that we got problems\n\nWho are they to criticize \n\nIf I tell you all my secrets would you tell me all your lies\n\nAnd when I stop writing her letters\n\nI want her to know that it's because \n\nI have someone that makes me feel the same exact way that she does\n\nAnd I will not deny the privilege to someone else who wants my love\n\nI have stitched a mask of confidence and I wear it like a glove\n\nAnd a man that knows what he's talking, spoke to me today\n\nHe said that no ones going to listen until you mean every word you say\n\nSo if you can't find the feeling, you better learn to lie\n\nAnd if you know we're gonna fail, then there's no point to even try\n\nNo point to try, no point try, no point to try\n\n\n\nI don't get it for real, this is blowing my mind\n\nWe keep saying we're unhappy and they keep saying that we're fine\n\nI guess pain will be the only thing I ever get to bring\n\nBut I will send it through the air like a loosely gripped baseball bat swing\n\nAll I ever wanted was something different, maybe by another name\n\nWe could set ourselves on fire, there is cleansing in the flame\n\n\n\nSo keep clapping and dancing \n\nLet them know you're still alive and if you're tired of giving up\n\nAt least make them think that you surived\n\nSo keep laughing, its not funny but at least you don't have to cry\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning and you know you're still alive\n\nYou're still alive, you know you're still alive\n\nYou're still alive, you know you're still alive\n\n\n\nUntil we break down, til we shut down\n\nUntil the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground\n\nUntil we break down, til we shut down\n\nUntil the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground\n\nUntil we break down, til we shut down\n\nUntil the weight of our lifeless bodies hit the ground\n\n\n\nAnd a man that knows what he's talking, spoke to me today\n\nHe said that no ones going to listen until you mean every word you say\n\nSo if you can't find the feeling, you better learn to lie\n\nAnd if you know we're gonna fail, then there's little point to even try\n\nLittle point to try",
