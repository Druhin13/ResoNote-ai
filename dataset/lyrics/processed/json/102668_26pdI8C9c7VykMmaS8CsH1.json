  "lyrics": "Moonlight through my window\r\nIn my bed I lay awake\r\nMy mind already made\r\nI'm out the door tomorrow\r\nI'm gonna walk\n\nWith no specific place in mind\n\nJust a bag this time\n\nSome clothes and a brush for my teeth\n\n\n\nWalk by the road and track\n\nJust a bag on my back\n\n\n\nI'll hit the road no place in mind\n\nNo idea what I might find\n\nMelodies and trees hand by my side\n\nKnowing it's all I need\n\nAll the symmetry, it makes me wonder\n\nCould it carry me through\n\nDog days of summer\n\n\n\nI thought of nothing as\n\nI walked down to the lake\n\nThe silence didn't break\n\nI sat for hours there\n\nI skipped a rock and then\n\nI jumped in\n\nI loved to swim\n\nAnd when I get out\n\n\n\nLie there until the sun goes down\n\nAll the stars that I found\n\n\n\nI'll hit the road place in mind\n\nNo idea what I might find\n\nMelodies and trees hang by my side\n\nKnowing it's all I need\n\nAll the symmetry, it makes me wonder\n\nCould it carry me through\n\nDog days of summer\n\n\n\nI'm out here\n\nFar away from my modern style\n\nPeru, Lyon\n\nI won't be home for quite a while\n\n\n\nI'll hit the road no place in mind\n\nNo idea what I might find\n\nMelodies and trees hang by my side\n\nKnowing it's all I need\n\nAll the symmetry, it makes me wonder\n\nCould it carry me through\n\nDog days of summer\n\n\n\nI'll hit the road no place in mind\n\nNo idea what I might find\n\nMelodies and trees hang by my side\n\nKnowing it's all I need\n\nAll the symmetry, it makes me wonder\n\nCould it carry me through\n\nDog days of summer",
