  "lyrics": "When the walls fall\r\nHear the sounds of trouble\r\nLike distant gunshots\r\nWaiting for the eye of the storm\r\nAnd in the silence\r\nWe'll dance in the silence\r\nWhen my words fail\r\nWhen my heart stops\r\nI wouldn't blame you\r\nIf you take the moment and run\r\nI wouldn't fight you\r\n'Cause I'm made to find you\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nI'm made to find you\r\nEvery door slam\r\nEvery wildfire\r\nComes between us\r\nAnd fades in the black of the night\r\nAnd In the darkness\r\nI'll find where your heart is\r\nWhen the road ends\r\nAnd you're broken\r\nOut in the open\r\nLooking for a new place to hide\r\nI'll leave the light on\r\nFor when want to come home\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nI'm made to find you\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nI'm made to find you\r\nâ™ª\r\nWhen you're broken\r\nAnd eed fixing\r\nWhen your soul lays heavy I'll lift it\r\nWhen in the same home, you go missing\r\nWell I know every place you've hidden\r\nWhen you're broken, I'm gonna right it\r\nIf you lose your way I'll light it\r\n'Cause I'm made to find you\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nI'm made to find you\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nI'm made to find you\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nWhere you go\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nThere I go\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nI'll fallow\r\nI'm made to find you\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nWhere you go\r\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh\r\nThere I go\r\nI'll fallow\r\nI'm made to find you",
