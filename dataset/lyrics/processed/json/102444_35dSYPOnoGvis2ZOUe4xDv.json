  "lyrics": "I can see the storms, in her eyes now\r\nI'm falling overboard, in the waves\r\nIn over my head and she's a high tide\r\nThat keeps pushing me away\r\nI thought that we would build this together\r\nBut everything I touch just seems to break\n\nAm I your sail or your anchor?\n\nAm I the calm or the hurricane?\n\nI feel the ground start to shake\n\nI hear a voice shouting, \"Move!\"\n\nBut there is no fucking way I'd leave you\n\n\n\nSo I'll just hold you like a hand grenade\n\nYou touch me like a razor blade\n\nI wish there was some other way right now\n\nLike a house on fire we're wrapped in flames\n\nI'd burn here if that's what it takes\n\nTo let you know I won't let go of you\n\n\n\nBut is the soundtrack to our lives\n\nThe bang of a slamming door?\n\nWhat happens when we all start to feel like\n\nNothing matters anymore?\n\nEvery day like a chambered round\n\nA trigger pulled, a hammer click\n\nA breath we hold, a world outside I can't control\n\nNo matter what I do\n\n\n\nSo I'll just hold you like a hand grenade\n\nYou touch me like a razor blade\n\nI wish there was some other way right now\n\nLike a house on fire we're wrapped in flames\n\nI'd burn here if that's what it takes\n\nTo let you know I won't let go of you\n\n\n\nAnd how is it a thing?\n\nThat we just wanna hurt each other\n\nI'm waiting on for rain\n\nFeels like is gonna rain forever\n\nSomeday you will learn\n\nThat all I ever did was for you\n\nAnd I would do it all again\n\nI would do it all again\n\n\n\n'Til then I'll hold you like a hand grenade\n\nYou touch me like a razor blade\n\nI wish there was some other way right now\n\nLike a house on fire we're wrapped in flames\n\nI'd burn here if that's what it takes\n\nTo let you know I can't let go of you\n\nOf you, of you, of you, of you",
