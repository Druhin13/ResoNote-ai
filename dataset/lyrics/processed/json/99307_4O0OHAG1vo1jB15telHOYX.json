  "lyrics": "If a melody is like a memory\r\nYou're a long hot summer night symphony\r\nBlaring on the speakers of my Monte Carlo\r\nDown FM 109 on my FM Radio\r\nWe could take it slow\n\nPut it on cruise control\n\nYou know it's been a while\n\n\n\nWe're never going outta style\n\nI was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night\n\nNever going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy\n\nGetting hot and heavy after all this time\n\nThe trends will come and go\n\nThe winds of change will blow\n\nThe way we love is never going outta style singing\n\n\n\nRebel rebel at the top of our lungs\n\nOut of town windows down playing those dashboard drums\n\nEverybody said you'd never make it too far\n\nWith some poor boy playing on some pawn shop guitar\n\n\n\nYou know my crazy dreams,\n\nWere busting at the seams\n\nJust like these old boots and jeans\n\n\n\nWe're never going outta style\n\nI was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night\n\nNever going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy\n\nGetting hot and heavy after all this time\n\nThe trends will come and go\n\nThe winds of change will blow\n\nThe way we love is never going, never going outta style\n\nWe're never going outta style\n\n\n\nI'll pop my collar do my best James Dean\n\nWe'll hit the road like a Steve McQueen movie scene\n\nShow me your million dollar Marilyn smile\n\nAnd I'll show you a love love love\n\n\n\nThat's never going outta style\n\nI was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night\n\nNever going outta style in my Chevy, parking at the levy\n\nGetting hot and heavy after all this time\n\nThe trends will come and go\n\nThe winds of change will blow\n\nThe way we love is never going outta style\n\n\n\nWe could take it slow\n\nPut it on cruise control\n\nThe way we love is never going outta style\n\n\n\nNever going outta style\n\nI was thinking... while the sun is sinking... low we could go all night\n\nWe're never going outta style\n\nIn my Chevy, parking at the levy,\n\nGetting hot and heavy after all this time\n\nNever going outta style\n\nWe're never going outta style\n\nYeah, we're never going outta style",
