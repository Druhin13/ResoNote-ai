No Elvis Presley\n\nI gotta keep that pole wit' me that's a brand new XD\n\nDeep in these skreets so my girl feelin' like that I won't make it far\n\nBut listen baby\n\n\n\nI know times get hard, I gotta keep it on\n\nHope I make it far, I know times get hard\n\nI know times get hard, I gotta keep it on\n\nHope I make it far, I know times get hard\n\n\n\nEverything is gonna be alright\n\nHe's comin' back, like he said he would\n\nEverything is gonna be alright\n\nHe's comin' back, like he said he would",
