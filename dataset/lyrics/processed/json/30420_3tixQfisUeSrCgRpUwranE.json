  "lyrics": "Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,\r\nEverytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,\r\nWhy the Gods above me, who must be in the know.\r\nThink so little of me, they allow you to go.\r\nWhen you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,\r\nI can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,\n\nThere's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to\n\nminor,\n\nEverytime we say goodbye.\n\n\n\nWhen you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,\n\nI can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,\n\nThere's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to\n\nminor,\n\nEverytime we say goodbye.",
