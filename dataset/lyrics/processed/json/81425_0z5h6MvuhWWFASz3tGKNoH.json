That do that, do that?\n\nPut that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that \n\nI be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold \n\nI been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw \n\n\n\nI'm so fancy \n\nYou already know \n\nI'm in the fast lane \n\nFrom L.A. to Tokyo \n\nI'm so fancy \n\nCan't you taste this gold \n\nRemember my name, 'bout to blow \n\n\n\nTrash the hotel \n\nLet's get drunk at the mini bar \n\nMake the phone call \n\nFeels so good getting what I want \n\nKeep on turning it up \n\nChandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck \n\nFilm star, yeah I'm deluxe \n\nClassic, expensive, you don't get to touch \n\n\n\nStill stunting, how you love that \n\nGot the whole world asking how I does that \n\nHot girl, hands off, don't touch that \n\nLook at that I bet you wishing you could clutch that \n\nThat's just the way you like it, huh? \n\nYou're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh? \n\nNever turn down nothing, slayin these hoes \n\nGo trigger on the gun like \n\n\n\nI'm so fancy \n\nYou already know \n\nI'm in the fast lane \n\nFrom L.A. to Tokyo \n\nI'm so fancy \n\nCan't you taste this gold \n\nRemember my name, 'bout to blow \n\n\n\nWho that, who that, I-G-G-Y \n\nThat do that, do that, I-G-G-Y \n\nWho that, who that, I-G-G-Y \n\n(Blow...)\n\n\n\nWho that, who that, I-G-G-Y \n\nThat do that, do that, I-G-G-Y \n\nWho that, who that, I-G-G-Y \n\n(Blow...)",
