  "lyrics": "Poison are you lips when you're kissing me\r\nBut I don't wanna give it up\r\nWhy do I do this to myself, when I know you're not good enough?\r\nSay that I could break it off with you\r\nOh, like I have the choice\r\nI try to run away, but me legs don't work when they hear your voice\n\n\n\nAnd your love is stuck to me like sadness to the blues\n\nTry to shake it but my stomach is tied up in knots at the thought of you\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know why I do the things that I do\n\nI don't know why I can't say no\n\nI don't know why I'm so hung up on you\n\nI can't leave when I can't let go\n\nI don't know why I've given you the power\n\nTo lift me up so high then drop me down\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nWhy I'm still around\n\n\n\nA bad habit I can't quit\n\nGive it to me, I need it\n\nSo hung up, you got me addicted\n\nNever thought I'd be obsessed until I met you\n\nNow I can't let you go\n\n\n\nAnd your love is stuck to me like sadness to the blues\n\nTry to shake it but my stomach is tied up in knots at the thought of you\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know why I do the things that I do\n\nI don't know why I can't say no\n\nI don't know why I'm so hung up on you\n\nI can't leave when I can't let go\n\nI don't know why I've given you the power\n\nTo lift me up so high then drop me down\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nWhy I'm still around\n\n\n\nNo one's worth your tears\n\nAnd the one that is won't make you cry (make you cry)\n\nSo it's time I packed my bags and left, said my goodbye\n\n'Cause it's not my fault\n\nIt's time I say no, I'm gonna let go\n\nIt's got to be you who's high and dry\n\n\n\nI don't know why I do the things that I do\n\nI don't know why I can't say no\n\nI don't know why I'm so hung up on you\n\nI can't leave when I can't let go\n\nI don't know why I've given you the power\n\nTo lift me up so high then drop me down\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nWhy I'm still-\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nWhy I'm still-\n\nAnd I don't know\n\nWhy I'm still around",
