  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Out Of It par The Story So Far\r\nLeaning on a bad knee\nDon't really wanna be with anyone\nCan you hear in my key?\nHow can you not see it's not always fun?\nWait, score, speed back, lock the door, just pour\nI'm gettin' numb\nNot enough, gimme more soda\nSoaking through the floor of 51\n\nMy appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it\nI can't believe you're still upset, get over it\nAnd leave me alone\n\nMy appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it\nI can't believe you're still upset, get over it\nAnd leave me alone\n\n\nGlue me into my seat\nSpill onto my feet and let it run\n'Cause I am all that you need\nThe hunger I feed, my loaded gun\nAlways sore in my back from the spine that I lack to really be done\nThat's enough, no more\nI'm barely breathing anymore\n\nAsk me how did I let this get worse?\nDove through the mud for my verse\nTell me, how many wounds can you nurse?\nDive into nothing head first\n\nMy appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it\nI can't believe you're still upset, get over it\nAnd leave me alone\n\n\nMy appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it\nI can't believe you're still upset, get over it\nAnd leave me alone\n\nIt's holding on but barely by the edge\nYou always ask me where I go\nI'm high now, I'll hide it from you and her\nMy closest friends and everyone\n\nMy appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it\nI can't believe you're still upset, get over it\nAnd leave me alone\n\nMy appropriate opiate has me out of it, out of it\nI can't believe you're still upset, get over it\nAnd leave me alone",
