  "lyrics": "I know you moved onto someone new\r\nHope life is beautiful\r\nYou were the light for me to find my truth\r\nI just wanna say, thank you\r\nLeaving to find my soul\n\nTold her I had to go\n\nAnd I know it ain't pretty\n\nWhen our hearts get broke\n\nToo young to feel this old\n\nWatching us both turn cold\n\nOh, I know it ain't pretty\n\nWhen two hearts get broke\n\nYeah, I know it ain't pretty\n\nWhen two hearts get broke\n\n\n\nI hope someday\n\nWe'll sit down together\n\nAnd laugh with each other\n\nAbout these days, these days\n\nAll our troubles\n\nWe'll lay to rest\n\nAnd we'll wish we could come back to these days\n\nThese days\n\nThese days, these days\n\nThese days, these days\n\n\n\nThree years of ups and downs\n\nNothing to show for it now\n\nAnd I know it ain't pretty when the fire burns out\n\nCalling me when I'm drunk remind me of what I've done\n\nAnd I know it ain't pretty when you're trying to move on, yeah\n\n\n\nI hope someday\n\nWe'll sit down together\n\nAnd laugh with each other\n\nAbout these days, these days\n\nAll our troubles\n\nWe'll lay to rest\n\nAnd we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days\n\n\n\nOh I know, I know\n\nOh I know, I know\n\nOh I know, I know\n\nThese days, these days\n\nOh I know, I know\n\nOh I know, I know\n\nOh I know, I know\n\nTo these days, these days\n\n\n\nCigarettes in the ash tray\n\nReminiscing on those past days\n\nI thought you didn't know my last name\n\nBut that changed\n\nAnd I travelled around the world\n\nThink where you living at now?\n\nI heard you moved to Austin\n\nGot an apartment and settled down\n\nAnd every once in a while\n\nI start texting\n\nWrite a paragraph\n\nBut then I delete the message\n\nThink 'bout you like a past time\n\nI could cry you a river\n\nGet you baptised or\n\nI wasn't ready to act right\n\nUsed to always think I'd get you back, right\n\nThey say that things fall apart\n\nWe were gonna move to Brooklyn\n\nYou were gonna study Art\n\nLove is just a tool\n\nTo remind who we are\n\nAnd that we are not alone\n\nWhen we're walking in the dark\n\n\n\nI hope someday\n\nWe'll sit down together\n\nAnd laugh with each other\n\nAbout these days, these days\n\nAll our troubles\n\nWe'll lay to rest\n\nAnd we'll wish we could come back to these days, these days\n\nWe'll wish we could come back to these days, these days",
