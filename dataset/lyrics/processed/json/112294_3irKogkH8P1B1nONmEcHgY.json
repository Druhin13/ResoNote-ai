  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson YSIV par Logic\r\nIt's that Young Sinatra IV shit right here\nRest in peace Mac Miller\nIt's been like 10 years\nHere we go (yeah)\n\nVisualizin' and realizin' my life is fuckin' crazy\nPoppin' like Jay-Z\nDirty Dancin' on the game like Swayze\nI'm one of the illest and bitch I've been ready to kill it since\nSo amazing bitch, I've been blazin', I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing\nThey just hit the tape while I sip scotch let the haters kick rocks, my shit is tip top and never flip-flop\n\nWhy? 'cause my soul too strong\nDid this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long\nThe flow sophisticated, all these youngins do is rhyme like they inebriated\nI'm hatin' but yet that's how you know I made it\nI'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this\nThe people, they feel us, me and my team made millions but you know we still us\nThat's why they wanna kill us, that's why they wanna kill us\nRattPack real all the time, we never phony\nI'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony\nWhile the rest of these rappers is acting\nPass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar\nFrom the new school rappers, I'm the the illest on the roster\n\nSmoke like a rasta\nBlack and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley\nThese racist motherfuckers hate that last line\nProbably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain\nSaid I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the garden\n\n[AZ]\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\n\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch like Sinatra, screamin \"Motherfuck the cops\"\nThey say they want the old Logic, the one that flow like a faucet I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they\nAgnostic If I spit over the Boom-Bap, then they perceive it as nostaligic\nBut the truth is, my subject matter has been the same\nAnd my production selection is still flame\nBut they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame And you still they little secret, that's the type of bullshit that they frequent\n\nFrom 19, to 2019, been murderin' this shit for a decade\nFrom the Boom-Bap to the Trap, I let my shits cascade (Listen, yeah, yeah)\nSo what's the dilly, pass the Phillie, get silly, that's on the really\nWe snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talkin' Aquilies\nPlay me like I ain't me, but I provided all the deets'\nWho you know worth 50 Mil, still rappin on break beats\nFrom Nasty Nas, Big-L, Tribe, The Roots, and many more\nOf course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur\nFuck the police, no we ain't fuckin' with Al Pastor\n\nI'm the bastard that mastered the flow, I said it once before fa sho While 6ix produce the kicks from the soul, you already know\nFuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class, I'm here to school 'em\nThis that real shit, I'm never foolin'\nI'm killin' these squares, we call it a massacre\nI got the bread, but these fuckers needs the dough like a baker The legends above me love me like the Rza, like Nas, like Jay 'Cause I mastered the flow from back in the day\nRespected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny\nThank you for the love and inspiration, plenty\nYeah I'm loved by many, and only hated by a little\nNow I think it's time to switch the lyricism, peep the riddle\n\nI was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission\nAlright, listen, put me 'round your neck and I might glisten\nThe ultimate connect, I'll get you anything you need\nFrom good credit, to good weed I can make any woman suck seed, control you with high degree\nAlong with anybody that's in need, I'll make 'em beg and plead\nI'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents\nWithout me, they'll evict you from your residence\nHov wrote about me on Dead Prezidents, never irellevent\nNot a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me\nNo matter what year I'm in, I'm current, see?\nPeople that have me, yeah they power's so immense\n\nBut people without me, make no sense, god damn\nThe world revolve around me, the law evolve around me\nThe shit people do to get a piece of me astound me\nBlood stains my face when drug deals go wrong\nI'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long\nYou could put me in check, but I'm still laughing all the way to the bank\nI'm the reason that the Titanic sank\nI'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire And some people even tuck me away 'til they retire\nI usually come around on the first and fifteenth\nIf you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath\nPeople go crazy when they feel me, in the Middle East they drill me\n\nIf you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me\nI knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade\nAlways schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid\nNow they never graduated, thought that shit a charade\nOnly thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid\nThen one day, they had a falling out on the block\nOne thought the other one had been stealing his rock\n'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock\nPulled out the Glock and his homie yelled 'stop!'\nBut before he had the chance to pull the trigger, oh shit here come the cops\nThey saw the gun and blew them both away\nNow there's two more kids dead in the street all before twenty Over me, the most important thing to man, money!\n\n[AZ]\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go\n\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch Like Sinatra screamin' \"motherfuck the cops\"\nWe just some motherfuckin' KIDS\nWe just some motherfuckin' KIDS\nWe love and miss you Mac\nFor those of y'all who don't know man, Mac is the whole reason I started doing this Young Sinatra shit\nI remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates\nHip to the Game, one of the illest beats ever and I remember when Mac flipped that shit for KoolAid and Frozen Pizza\nI thought it was the dopest shit man\nMac showed me that I could just do it all on my own\nMe and all my boys, all my homies and if it wasn't for him killing that beat I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young Broke and Infamous, damn\nIt's like 2010 And I title the track Young Sinatra\nAnd that was the birth of all this shit\nSo, thank you, I appreciate you, love you and miss you, yeah\nWe just some motherfuckin' KIDS",
