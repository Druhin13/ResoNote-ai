  "lyrics": "We won't leave till you realise\r\nThese are the reasons why we won't survive on our own\r\nNobody gets left behind\r\n(1, 2, 3, 4)\r\nYou didn't see it coming\n\nHow the world's in disarray\n\nAnd all that I have said comes back to haunt me\n\n\n\nI didn't see the lights\n\nEven though they're blinding me right in the eyes\n\nCouldn't read the signs\n\nTelling me to swim against the current as they're pulling me under\n\n\n\nI'm intoxicated, led astray by the fake\n\nUnconscious to the right solution\n\nOur minds are barely moving\n\nWe might deserve a second chance\n\nIf I can prove we're alive\n\n\n\nDon't say you didn't see it coming\n\nNow the world's in disarray\n\nAnd all that I have said comes back to haunt me\n\nDon't say you couldn't see the warnings\n\nOr the wolves outside the gates\n\nAnd all that I have said comes back to haunt me\n\n\n\nWe won't leave till you realise\n\nThese are the reasons why we won't survive on our own\n\nNobody gets left behind\n\n\n\n(Who told you it's) Ours for the taking?\n\nEvery man for himself\n\nIn favour of all who trade intelligence\n\nOrder for the selfish who don't deserve a second chance\n\nIf they're still picking a side\n\n\n\nIt's the dose that makes it poisonous\n\nIt tastes bitter but we're keeping our head above the surface\n\nWe're still alive although we've been bitten\n\nIt's like a sickness written into our anatomy\n\nThis is the sound of no one listening to you running your mouth\n\nAre you thinking out loud?\n\nJust can't see through the amount of shit you feel the need to surround yourself with\n\n(You feel the need to surround yourself with)\n\nBack up, I'm sick of telling you enough is enough\n\n\n\nIt takes my breath away\n\nBut I don't feel like I deserve the taste\n\nYou're missing the point, can't understand my pain\n\nSome people never change\n\nIt's like a fire without a flame\n\n\n\nDon't say you didn't see it coming\n\nNow the world's in disarray\n\nAnd all that I have said comes back to haunt me\n\nDon't say you didn't see it coming\n\nNow the world's in disarray\n\nAnd all that I have said comes back to haunt me\n\nDon't say you couldn't see the warnings\n\nOr the wolves outside the gates\n\nAnd all that I have said comes back to haunt me\n\n\n\nIt takes my breath away\n\nBut I don't feel like I deserve the taste\n\nYou're missing the point, can't understand my pain\n\nSome people never change\n\nIt's like a fire without a flame",
