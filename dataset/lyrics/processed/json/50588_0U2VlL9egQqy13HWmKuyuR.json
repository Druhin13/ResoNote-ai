  "lyrics": "Over the mountain \nDown in the valley \nLives a former talk-show host \nEverybody knows his name \nHe says there's no doubt about it \nIt was the myth of fingerprints \n\nI've seen them all and man \n\nThey're all the same \n\nWell, the sun gets weary \n\nAnd the sun goes down \n\nEver since the watermelon \n\nAnd the lights come up \n\nOn the black pit town \n\nSomebody says what's a better thing to do \n\nWell, it's not just me \n\nAnd it's not just you \n\nThis is all around the world \n\n\n\nOut in the Indian Ocean somewhere \n\nThere's a former army post \n\nAbandoned now just like the war \n\nAnd there's no doubt about it \n\nIt was the myth of fingerprints \n\nThat's what that old army post was for \n\n\n\nWell, the sun gets bloody \n\nAnd the sun goes down \n\nEver since the watermelon \n\nAnd the lights come up \n\nOn the black pit town \n\nSomebody says what's a better thing to do \n\nWell, it's not just me \n\nAnd it's not just you \n\nThis is all around the world \n\n\n\nOver the mountain \n\nDown in the valley \n\nLives the former talk-show host \n\nFar and wide his name was known \n\nHe said there's no doubt about it \n\nIt was the myth of fingerprints \n\nThat's why we must learn to live alone",
