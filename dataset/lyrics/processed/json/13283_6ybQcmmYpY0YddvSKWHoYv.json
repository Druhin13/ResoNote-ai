  "lyrics": "You have loved me well\r\nIn a million ways\r\nBut my wounds are all I know\r\nSo I turn my head\r\nAnd I hide my face\r\nToo afraid to come back home\n\n\n\nAll of the doors swing open\n\nWhen I see You, when I see You\n\nYou make my heart unbroken\n\nWhen I see You, when I see You\n\n\n\nAnd I come undone\n\nI come undone\n\n\n\nWhen my fear comes close\n\nAnd it robs me blind\n\nOh how Your love provides for me\n\nWhat a winding road, yeah\n\nWhat a river wide\n\nBeing Yours, becoming free, yeah\n\n\n\nAll of the doors swing open\n\nWhen I see You, when I see You\n\nYou make my heart unbroken\n\nWhen I see You, when I see You\n\n\n\nMy eyes more open the closer You come\n\nMy heart unfolds like a flower in the sun\n\nMy fear grows cold in the light of Your love\n\nMy heart unfolds like I'm coming undone\n\n\n\nMy eyes more open the closer You come\n\nMy heart unfolds like a flower in the sun\n\nMy fear grows cold in the light of Your love\n\nMy heart unfolds like I'm coming undone\n\n\n\nAll of the doors swing open\n\nWhen I see You, when I see You\n\nYou make my heart unbroken\n\nWhen I see You, oh when I see You\n\n\n\nAnd I come undone\n\nI come undone",
