  "lyrics": "Soon as I was born, I knew I was due to do some damage\r\nCame out the womb, doctors passed me around the room and panicked\r\nFour pounds, dark purple, couldn't even breathe on my own\r\nShakin' baby in an incubator, breathin' machine for my lungs\r\nDoctor told my mom and pops they gon' have to keep me for a couple months\r\nPapa regretting doin' coke, mama probably those couple blunts\n\nLittle did they know there was nothing to be ashamed of as long as we\n\nKeep the unconditional love between us, I feel like the Mona Lisa\n\nHospital found out my pops had a lapse in his insurance\n\nI learned just how people are quick to turn\n\nThe doctor came back and said, \"We're gon' release him\"\n\nThat's the same thing in my first deal the label head said\n\nSame as the judge after 365 days in jail cells\n\nYou probably think my moms and pops ain't raise me well\n\nWait, please, I was hard-headed\n\nThe only person who could get through to me was maybe Jay-Z\n\nThey tried to give my autistic son medicine for ADHD\n\nSame kid who could look at a piano and memorize all 88 keys\n\nI learned everything I need to know at day one in the hospital\n\nThey gonna doubt you, nigga\n\nAnd you can't even pay no one to care about you, nigga\n\n\n\nAs we proceed to give you what you need\n\nMy name is DJ Premier\n\nI'd like to introduce to you Ant Man Wonder\n\nOn behalf of Bad-Half Entertainment and Works of Mart\n\nPRhyme 2 is coming\n\n\n\n1966, March 21st\n\nIn July 17th, '61 marks the birth, the birth of two phenoms\n\nI'm talking about Chris Edward Martin and Keith Edward Elam\n\nThis is for the real Gang Starr fans, not the ones who call us P-Rhyme\n\nOne come from Massachusetts, the other from Texas\n\nHad a dream to become the next shit\n\nFilled up his whole truck trunk with records and moved to New York\n\nThat's where Premier the god linked with Guru the lord\n\nIf ever duplicated, hell froze and there was a blue moon before it\n\nAnd that shit birthed Group Home Freddie Foxxx, inspired shit\n\nLike Jay Z, Nas, B.I.G, I'm just comin' clean like the Jeru song\n\nYo! MTV raps, Rakim in the back\n\nFab 5 Freddy in the hat interviewin' Chubb Rock\n\nPac in the cut with his boots and Juice on (RIP)\n\nPac still killin' to this day, still the one they tryna be\n\nY'all know I'm from Detroit\n\nI'm diggin' in the crates, now I'm from the diamond-D\n\nI ain't wit the showbiz, I'm just AG tryna sign me a Fat Joe deal\n\nAnd go and ball and every bitch I got OG is on call, that's O.C\n\nBitch, I confess that I finesse\n\nI smile at death like Malcolm X, I'm solid, yes, in '99\n\nI told myself, if I could figure out how to bottle it, I'd be out of debt\n\nY'all niggas just novices, y'all can just move inside\n\nI got that car pedestrian confidence, yessir, I got that Uber Drive\n\nY'all wanna know who the best is?\n\nLook around at who alive and who done died (Then what?)\n\nThen look at me, Kendrick Lamar and Pusha T\n\nEm and the Slaughters, y'all don't have to look any farther for the rhymers\n\nY'all are the past, at the present time I'm the Future\n\n'Cause all my competition tryin' be Desiigners\n\nI'm just tired of being underrated by these lazy bloggers\n\nThey just tired of re-rewindin'\n\nY'all tired of me saying I'm the greatest? (Y'all tired yet?)\n\nFuck y'all, I'm tired of re-remindin'\n\nI survived Vietnam and my city laid me a grave\n\nPrem laced me boom-boom-God-damn with Lady of Rage\n\nSince then I've been on my Jaimie and Rae, nobody seein' me\n\nShe douche, I give her dick she never forget, that's D and D\n\nPreem, cut!\n\n\n\nCome on back with me, this black history",
