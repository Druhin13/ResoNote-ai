  "title": "A Tale of Rescue",
  "lyrics": "I am stranded on a beach that I've always known\r\nI have fallen in love with this curse though I know it's not home\r\nSo I call out for rescue, and I work down to bone\r\nJust searching for something -- no, anything --\r\nTo get me back home\n\n\n\nI am doubtful of a sail that could capture the wind\n\nBut I am speechless! The boat is open to let a doubter step in\n\n\n\nNow the sail is my rescue, and I rest down below\n\nWind so strong it could kill me, but it carries me home\n\n\n\nI am buried on the beach where I first began\n\nI live by the water that soon will wash over the sand\n\n\n\nThe sail is my rescue, and I rest down below\n\nWind so strong it could kill me, but it carries me home",
