  "lyrics": "I watch the lights, them fade away\r\nDoesn't seem so long ago when all your life was but a dream\r\nSeems like nothing new to me\r\nPack your bags again, you know it's time to leave\r\nWatch the tears run down your face\r\nYes I needed you to see\n\nIt's hard to be another place\n\nWhen I need you here with me\n\n\n\nOne more night and then I'm home\n\nSleepless nights out on the road\n\nAnd all these days have come and gone, still pass us by\n\nOne more night and then I'm home\n\n\n\nI've seen the light shine through your eyes\n\nFor the days don't seem as long when I think of you awhile\n\nAnother day, another try\n\nWhen I call you on the phone, let you know I'm still alive\n\nI'll bring the storm and calm the fire in your eyes\n\nIt won't be long until I hold you\n\nYet my mind, it won't unwind until it's right\n\nAnd all the things I should have told you\n\n\n\nOne more night and then I'm home\n\nSleepless nights out on the road\n\nAnd all these days have come and gone, still pass us by\n\nOne more night and then I'm home\n\n\n\nOne more night and then I'm home\n\nSleepless nights out on the road\n\nAnd all these days have come and gone, still pass us by\n\nOne more night and then I'm home",
