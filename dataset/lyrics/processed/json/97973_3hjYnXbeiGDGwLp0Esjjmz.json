What?\r\nBringin' up old shit\r\nDinosaur\r\nDinosaur\r\nYou're gonna find what you're looking for\n\nKeep on digging through the dirt, girl\n\nJust leave them bones where they at now\n\nAnd wash your hands in the faucet\n\nYou only gonna exhaust yourself\n\nShe was way before you met\n\nHe gon' say, \"What you bringin' up the past for?\n\nBringin' up old shit. Dinosaur.\"\n\n\n\nYou're gonna find what you're looking for\n\nKeep doing that research\n\nAnd when it surface, it's gonna hurt\n\nAnd now you trying to figure out what's worse\n\nLook at you, mad again\n\nBut you can't be mad at him\n\nHe gon' say, \"What you bringin' up the past for?\n\nBringin' up old shit. Dinosaur.\"\n\n\n\nSee? That's what you get (That's what you get)\n\nYou wanted a reason to flip out on him again\n\nYou just had to dust it off (Had to dust it off)\n\nYou just had it bring it back (Had to bring it back)\n\nCouldn't leave it in the dirt\n\nHe wanted a reason, you just gave it to him\n\nCongratulations\n\n\n\nYou wonder where do the good ones go?\n\nThey're on the verge of extinction\n\nBut you got one sitting right at home\n\nWhenever you can't reach him\n\nYou thinking that he acting stank\n\nShorty, that was your mistake\n\nHe gon' say, \"What you bringin' up the past for?\n\n(You bringing up the past for?)\n\nBringin' up old shit. Dinosaur.\"\n\n\n\nSee? That's what you get (That's what you get)\n\nYou wanted a reason to flip out on him again\n\nYou just had to dust it off (Had to dust it off)\n\nYou just had it bring it back (Had to bring it back)\n\nCouldn't leave it in the dirt\n\nHe wanted a reason and you just gave it to him\n\nCongratulations\n\n\n\nThat's what you get (That's what you get)\n\nYou wanted a reason to flip out on him again\n\nYou just had to dust it off (Had to dust it off)\n\nYou just had it bring it back (Had to bring it back)\n\nCouldn't leave it in the dirt\n\nHe wanted a reason and you just gave it to him\n\nCongratulations\n\n\n\nWhy you play a game you gonna lose?\n\nIt's chess not checkers\n\nThink through your moves\n\nWhy make accusations that you just can't prove?\n\nDwee-deed'n-deed'n-doo-doo, whoa-mmmm-hmmm\n\n\n\nSee? That's what you get (That's what you get)\n\nYou wanted a reason to flip out on him again\n\nYou just had to dust it off\n\n(You go back and forth and forth and back)\n\nYou just had it bring it back (Had to bring it back)\n\nCouldn't leave it in the dirt\n\n(Bring it back and bring it back)\n\nHe wanted a reason, you just gave it to him\n\nCongratulations",
