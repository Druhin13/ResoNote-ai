  "lyrics": "Ooh yeah yeah, oh\r\nSo young, naive, when we took the leap\r\nWanted to be everything you wanted\r\nOne house, two cars, three years for us\r\nI don't think you know how good you go tit\n\n\n\nYou painted me a picture, I really tried to be her\n\nAnd I cried a river for you\n\nYou think you got it so hard, I think you got a cold heart\n\nWanna hear the worst part? Do you?\n\n\n\nIf I'm not the one, good luck finding something better\n\nGive you all my love, are you crazy? Boy, you\n\nBetter recognize that you're wasting all my time\n\nIf I'm not the one\n\n\n\nYou talk so tough, sit down, grow up\n\nI don't need this foolishness around me\n\n'Cause it's my house, my life, and you kill my vibe\n\nNow I know I'll never make you happy\n\n\n\nSo let me paint you a picture\n\nI'm tired of trying to fix ya\n\nI'm not crying a river for you\n\n\n\nIf I'm not the one, good luck finding something better\n\nGive you all my love, are you crazy? Boy, you\n\nBetter recognize that you're wasting all my time\n\nIf I'm not the one\n\n\n\nOne\n\nOne\n\nIf I'm not the one for you, good luck\n\nFinding better love won't be enough\n\nYou're all out of time, you're wasting mine, boy\n\nIf I'm not the one\n\n\n\nIf I'm not the one, good luck finding something better\n\nGive you all my love, are you crazy? Boy, you\n\nBetter recognize that you're wasting all my time\n\nIf I'm not the one\n\nIf I'm not the one (One, oh baby)\n\n(If I'm not the one for you, good luck)\n\nGood luck finding something better\n\nGive you all my love, are you crazy? Boy, you\n\n(Finding better love won't be enough)\n\nBetter recognize that you're wasting all my time\n\n(You're all out of time, you're wasting mine, boy)\n\nIf I'm not the one",
