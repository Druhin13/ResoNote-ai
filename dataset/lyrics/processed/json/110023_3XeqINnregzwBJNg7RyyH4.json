  "lyrics": "I know a girl, she's like a curse\r\nWe want each other, no one will break first\r\nSo many nights, trying to find someone new\r\nThey don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know\r\nWhen people ask about us, now, we just brush it off\n\nI don't know why we act like it means nothing at all\n\nI wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah\n\n\n\nI pretend that I'm not ready\n\nWhy do we put each other through hell?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\nAnd you say hi like you just met me\n\nWhy do we put each other through hell?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\n\n\nWhen I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe\n\nCan't help but think every song's about me\n\nAnd every line, every word that I write\n\nYou are the muse in the back of my mind, oh\n\n\n\nDon't want to ask about it 'cause you might brush it off\n\nI'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all\n\nI don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want\n\n\n\nI pretend that I'm not ready\n\nWhy do we put each other through hell?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\nAnd you say hi like you just met me\n\nWhy do we put each other through hell?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\n\n\nI pretend that I'm not ready\n\nWhy do we put each other through hell?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\nAnd you say hi like you just met me\n\nWhy do we put each other through hell?\n\nWhy can't we just get over ourselves?\n\n\n\nI know a girl, she's like a curse\n\nWe want each other, no one will break first\n\nSo many nights, trying to find someone new\n\nThey don't mean nothing compared to you",
