  "lyrics": "When I was seventeen\r\nIt was a very good year\r\nIt was a very good year for small town girls\r\nAnd soft summer nights\r\nWe'd hide from the lights\r\nOn the village green\n\nWhen I was seventeen\n\n\n\nWhen I was twenty-one\n\nIt was a very good year\n\nIt was a very good year for city girls\n\nWho lived up the stair\n\nWith all that perfumed hair\n\nAnd it came undone\n\nWhen I was twenty-one\n\n\n\nWhen I was thirty-five\n\nIt was a very good year\n\nIt was a very good year for blue-blooded girls\n\nOf independent means\n\nWe'd ride in limousines\n\nTheir chauffeurs would drive\n\nWhen I was thirty-five\n\n\n\nBut now the days grow short\n\nIm in the autumn of the year\n\nAnd now I think of my life as vintage wine\n\nFrom fine old kegs\n\nFrom the brim to the dregs\n\nAnd it poured sweet and clear\n\nIt was a very good year",
