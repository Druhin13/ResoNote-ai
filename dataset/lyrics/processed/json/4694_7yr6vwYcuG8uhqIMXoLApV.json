  "lyrics": "I pave the backstreet with the mist of my brain\r\nI cross the gap between the platform and train\r\n(Falling into me)\r\nViolet strip lights I try to dissipate my focus\r\n(Falling into me)\r\nBut I realise I can’t keep hiding my emotions\n\n(Falling into me)\n\nI can’t just lay or let be\n\nWhen all the words you say are hanging onto me\n\nYou occupy my mind by every which way\n\n\n\nAnd when I climb the steps to the street\n\nThere is no reason to doubt myself here\n\nMy thoughts were pouring down with the rain\n\nBut now I see that it’s so crystal clear\n\n\n\nWe got this\n\n\n\nYou, me, this\n\nNow wherever we go is the best place\n\nNo need to be restrained\n\nNow whatever we know we should just say\n\nYou, me, this\n\nNow wherever we go is the best place\n\nNo need to be restrained\n\nNow whatever we know we should just say\n\n\n\nWhen we were like night bloom violets\n\nOur handprints pressed to my window\n\nI was feeling quite right like this as the lightning glitched\n\nAnd it echoed in your eyes\n\nBeating right through the denim\n\nYou left a dent in my home screen\n\nWe’re in so far, but we need it\n\n\n\nYou know I’d\n\nBite my hair as I tried to justify\n\nYou know I, I\n\nYou know I\n\nWe got this\n\n\n\nYou, me, this\n\nNow wherever we go is the best place\n\nNo need to be restrained\n\nNow whatever we know we should just say\n\nYou, me, this\n\nNow wherever we go is the best place\n\nNo need to be restrained\n\nNow whatever we know we should just say\n\n\n\nNo hesitation at the traffic lights\n\nBeneath the black in my windscreen\n\nWe drive\n\nI think they caught it on camera\n\nCan’t help but feel it again\n\n\n\nIt’s just the necessary price you pay\n\nIf you listen to your instincts\n\nAnd I\n\nDon’t wanna cast it in concrete\n\nAnd then it hits me again\n\n\n\nWe’re so illuminated in the night\n\nAlight together down the fireline\n\nFireline\n\n\n\nBeat, beat, beat, beat\n\nBeat, beat, beat, beat, beat",
