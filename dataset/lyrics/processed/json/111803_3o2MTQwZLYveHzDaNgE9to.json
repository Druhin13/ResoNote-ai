  "lyrics": "Born alone on a lonely planet\r\nFull of broken dreams\r\nWhere no one understands me\r\nWhen I finally met an angel\r\nI didn’t know what to say\r\nShe just held my hand\n\nAND we would lay awake at night\n\nLooking at the stars\n\nThinking of the ones we’ve lost\n\nAnd wonder where they are \n\nWhen we lit another candle\n\nShe asked me who’s to blame\n\nThen she put her arms around me and held me to the flame\n\n\n\nSo why do we hurt each other\n\nWe don’t hear the words from one another’s\n\n\n\nPrayers\n\nThey don’t mean a thing at all\n\nDo they answer when you call\n\nThese prayers\n\nWhen you don’t mean what you say\n\nWould you die for me today\n\nNow I just can’t relate\n\n\n\nNone of this makes sense\n\nIn this reality\n\nGod just leaves the room when I turn on my TV\n\nI see a little girl who’s crying because she lost her family\n\nAll these strangers sending thoughts and prayers\n\nShe’s buried underneath \n\n\n\nWhy do we kill each other\n\nWe can’t feel the pain in one another’s\n\n\n\nPrayers\n\nThey don’t mean a thing at all\n\nDo they answer when you call\n\nThese prayers\n\nWhen you don’t mean what you say\n\nWould you die for me today\n\nNow I just can’t relate\n\n\n\nWe’re so far away from one another\n\nWe keep building walls between each other’s\n\n\n\nPrayers\n\nThey don’t mean a thing at all\n\nDo they answer when you call\n\nThese prayers\n\nWhen you don’t mean what you say\n\nWould you die for me today\n\nNow I just can’t relate\n\n\n\nPrayers\n\nThey don’t mean a thing at all\n\nDo they answer when you call\n\nThese prayers\n\nWhen you don’t mean what you say\n\nWould you die for me today",
