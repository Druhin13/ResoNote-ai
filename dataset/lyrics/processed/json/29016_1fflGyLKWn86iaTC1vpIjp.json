  "lyrics": "People they tell me\r\nAs they look upon my skin and bones\r\nYou're ragged and you're dirty\r\nHardly worth your weight in gold\r\nFor all of your suffering\n\nNo one gives a good goddamn\n\nIt's all about the money, son\n\nWe doubt you understand\n\n\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nThey say your diamond is too rough\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nI'd never trade it for their love\n\n\n\nSometimes at night\n\nI look upon the stars above\n\nThey never shine as bright\n\nAs my diamond in the rough\n\n\n\nPeople they tell me\n\nJust to give up and go on home\n\nBut to have no home to go to\n\nIs something they'll never know\n\n\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nThey say your diamond is too rough\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nI'd never trade it for their love\n\n\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nThey say your diamond is too rough\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nI'd never trade it for their love\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel\n\nLike I ain't getting nowhere\n\nI'm walking down this road\n\nWith a burden I can't bear\n\n\n\nI never let this world\n\nGet too heavy on my shoulders\n\n'Cause my diamond always will\n\nPull the weight that I'm under\n\n\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nThey say your diamond is too rough\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nI'd never trade it for their love\n\n\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nThey say your diamond is too rough\n\nYodelay-ho\n\nI'd never trade it for their love",
