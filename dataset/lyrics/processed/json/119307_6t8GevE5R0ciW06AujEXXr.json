And my life's on charge\n\nTwo shows, pay rent, get a girl, get a job\n\nBelly of the beast, when I walk in the streets\n\nAll I see is fake love, insecurity\n\nTwo months, seven days, oh, when you first came\n\nWalked in, Off-White, all pink, okay\n\n\n\nThe past, the past, the past, the past\n\nLeave it in the past\n\nThe past, the past, the past, the past\n\nLeave it in the past",
