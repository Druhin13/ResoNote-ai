  "lyrics": "I keep on running backwards\r\nI keep on losing faith\r\nI thought I had the answers\r\nI thought I knew the way\r\nMy brother said be patient\n\nMy mother held my hand\n\nDon't know what I'm chasing\n\nDon't know who I am\n\n\n\nWoke up this morning holdin' my head\n\nThinkin' last night is one of regret\n\nWatchin' after bad decisions, the blurry vision\n\nThe clues that I'm still a mess\n\n\n\nSpittin' out the taste I have in my mouth\n\nKnowin' what this all is really about\n\nKnowin' there's an explanation, an expiration\n\nI gotta figure shit out\n\n\n\nAnd they're askin' me if I can't see\n\nThe darkness down below\n\nAnd I know it's true, I say I do\n\nAnd half the time I don't\n\n\n\nMaybe I can't make what it may take\n\nTo leave this thing behind\n\nBut I shut my eyes and cross each line\n\nAnd every time\n\n\n\nI keep on running backwards\n\nI keep on losing faith\n\nI thought I had the answers\n\nI thought I knew the way\n\n\n\nMy brother said be patient\n\nMy mother held my hand\n\nI don't know what I'm chasing\n\nI don't know who I am\n\n\n\nWaking in the dead of night, I can't sleep\n\nSleeping in the light of day for like weeks\n\nReality was out of focus, I could be hopeless\n\nInstead I gritted my teeth\n\n\n\nI didn't have the patience left to explain\n\nDidn't wanna wake when nobody came\n\nI know the path I had's uneven, but while I'm breathing\n\nI have to make my own lane\n\n\n\nAnd they're askin' me if I can't see\n\nThe darkness down below\n\nAnd I know it's true, I say I do\n\nAnd half the time I don't\n\n\n\nMaybe I can't make what it may take\n\nTo leave this thing behind\n\nBut I shut my eyes and cross each line\n\nAnd every time\n\n\n\nI keep on running backwards\n\nI keep on losing faith\n\nI thought I had the answers\n\nI thought I new the way\n\n\n\nMy brother said be patient\n\nMy mother held my hand\n\nI don't know what I'm chasing\n\nI don't know who I am\n\n\n\nSo, I make it up as I go-oh-oh\n\nI make it up as I go-oh-oh\n\nSo, I make it up as I go-oh-oh\n\nI make it up as I go, as I go\n\n\n\nI keep on running backwards\n\nI keep on losing faith\n\nI thought I had the answers\n\nI thought I new the way\n\n\n\nMy brother said be patient\n\nMy mother held my hand\n\nI don't know what I'm chasing\n\nDon't know who I am\n\n\n\nSo, I make it up as I go-oh-oh\n\nI make it up as I go-oh-oh\n\nSo, I make it up as I go-oh-oh\n\nI make it up as I go, as I go",
