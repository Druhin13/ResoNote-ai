  "lyrics": "I've been broken, I've been beat down\r\nSo full of shame and doubt\r\nBeen from the mountain, down to rock bottom\r\nMore times than I can count\r\nBut we were born to be great\n\nDon't just throw it away\n\n\n\nYou've been hiding this pain for so long\n\nWake up get off the ground\n\nThere is a purpose in all the madness\n\nBut you gotta fight to find out\n\n\n\nCause we were born to be great\n\nDon't just throw it away\n\n\n\nLive another day\n\nWe were born to be great\n\nLive another day\n\nDon't just throw it away\n\nLive another day\n\n\n\nThere's a meaning in the madness\n\nI promise one day you'll get past this\n\nSo don't give up on second chances\n\nCause there's a meaning in the madness\n\n\n\nListen\n\nThe hard times and the pain\n\nIs what makes our story great\n\nSo get back up again\n\nAnd live another day\n\nFight to feel alive\n\nTo be the voice of change\n\nTogether we will rise\n\nAnd live another day\n\n\n\nLive another day\n\nWe were born to be great\n\nLive another day\n\nDon't just throw it away\n\nLive another day\n\nWe were born to be great\n\nLive another day\n\nDon't just throw it away\n\nLive another day",
