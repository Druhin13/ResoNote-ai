  "lyrics": "Everything you wanted in your life\r\nHas happened to you now\r\nBut you’re standing in the courtyard\r\nMourning new lost friends\r\nWhose lives were cut short before the summer's end\r\nAnd the boy you want so bad is sitting courtside with miss everything you hate\n\nAnd it shapes the way you look at men\n\nYou’re bothered by the weight of having to pretend\n\nThat it's still summer, but it's not summer\n\n\n\n18 years\n\nChained to my fears\n\nIn too deep, losing sleep\n\nTragedies reminding me of why I’m losing sleep\n\nI’m in too deep\n\nI give up, I give up, talk to me\n\nI give up, I give up, talk to me\n\n\n\nEvery boy you seem to trust\n\nLoves to let you down\n\nThey're always Standing on the edge of what makes sense\n\nLike it's tryna' focus frame with a dirty lens\n\nAnd the girls who never let you let it down, the way you give it up\n\nSo you fill your tongue with chemicals\n\nAnd you know the skin hardly memorable\n\nNot like this summer, not like this summer\n\n\n\n18 years\n\nChained to my fears\n\nIn too deep, losing sleep\n\nTragedies reminding me of why I’m losing sleep\n\nI’m in too deep\n\nI give up, I give up, talk to me\n\nI give up, I give up, talk to me",
