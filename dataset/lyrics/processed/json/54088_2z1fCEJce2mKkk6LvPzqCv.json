  "lyrics": "I see the fire in your veins\r\nIt burns and lingers on, just for another taste\r\nCan't seem to find a way, or find a face to blame\r\nThese alluring sands of time\r\nThey’ll keep you feeling like you’re barely alive\r\nI see life slipping away\n\nBut only I can make the change\n\n\n\nSavage pains, addictive reasons\n\nI know in my forgiving heart\n\nYou’ll learn to love again, learn to live again\n\n\n\nI'm willing to let go of this feeling that's controlling me\n\nI’m ready to be free but scared of the wrong things that keep a hold of me\n\n\n\nI find it hard to make it out in a world that seems to be so dark\n\nIt always seems like your mind is falling apart, it’s falling apart\n\nI can see you suffering and the constant hate it brings\n\nThis can't be all you believe\n\nThrough all the shit you've done you're still apart of me\n\n\n\nSavage pains, addictive reasons\n\nI know in my forgiving heart\n\nYou’ll learn to love again\n\nI'll make you understand\n\n\n\nI'm willing to let go of this feeling that's controlling me\n\nI’m ready to be free but scared of the one thing that keeps a hold of me\n\nI’m willing to let go\n\nI’m ready to be free, can't keep a hold of me\n\n\n\nCan someone make me come to my senses?\n\nI’m lost in this cycle\n\nI think this emptiness is endless\n\nI have nothing left to show\n\nI can't fucking waste my life\n\n\n\nI have nothing left to show\n\n\n\nI'm willing to let go of this feeling that's controlling me\n\nI’m ready to be free but scared of the one thing that keeps a hold of me\n\nI’m willing to let go\n\nI’m ready to be free, can’t keep a hold of me",
