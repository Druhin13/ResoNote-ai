  "lyrics": "Fast, on a rough road riding\r\nHigh, through the mountains climbing\r\ntwisting, turning further from my home.\r\nYoung, like a new moon rising\r\nFierce, through the rain and lightning\r\nWandering out into this great unknown.\n\n\n\nAnd I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'\n\nIf I don't survive .........\n\n\n\nI was Born Free!\n\nI was borrrrrrn free\n\nI was born free, Born Free.\n\n\n\nFree, like a river raging\n\nStrong, if the wind I'm facing.\n\nChasing dreams and racing father time.\n\nDeep like the grandest canyon,\n\nWild like an untamed stallion.\n\nIf you can't see my heart you must be blind.\n\n\n\nYou can knock me down and watch me bleed\n\nBut you can't keep no chains on me.\n\n\n\nI was Born Free!\n\nI was borrrrrrn free\n\nI was born free, Born Free.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down\n\nDeep into my eyes.\n\n\n\nI was born free!\n\n\n\nHeyy yayaaa yaayayaaa.\n\nOhhh hooo...\n\n\n\nCalm facing danger\n\nLost, like an unknown stranger\n\nGrateful for my time with no regrets.\n\n\n\nClose to my destination\n\nTired, frail and aching\n\nWaitin patiently for the sun to set.\n\n\n\nAnd when its done believe that I will yell it from that mountain highhh!\n\n\n\nI was Born Free!\n\nI was borrrrrrn free\n\nI was born free, Born Free.\n\n\n\nAnd I will vow to the shining seas and celebrate God's Grace on me.\n\n\n\nI was Born Free!\n\nI was borrrrrrn free\n\nI was born free, Born Free.\n\n\n\nOh, ohh ohh ohhwaahhoo..",
