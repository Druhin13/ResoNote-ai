  "lyrics": "It's been six months since we talked at all\r\nYou asked me not to so I didn't call\r\nYet it's nice to run into you\r\nEven though it might be too soon\r\n'Cause it seems like you've been moving on\n\nAnd I know you\n\nKnow that I got someone new\n\nSo I'll try not to say a name\n\nAnd I know you\n\nKnow that I got someone new\n\nBut to tell the truth it's not the same\n\n\n\nShe's just a distraction, I confess\n\nShe'll never take up the space that you left\n\nJust a distraction, I confess\n\nSomeone to hold who can help me forget\n\n\n\nI don't wanna go off and say too much\n\nBut it's hard not to you think bout the way it was\n\nIt is nice to run into you\n\nEven though it might be too soon\n\n'Cause she's alright but it isn't love\n\n\n\nAnd I know you\n\nKnow that I got someone new\n\nSo I'll try not to say a name\n\nAnd I know you\n\nKnow that I got someone new\n\nBut to tell the truth it's not the same\n\n\n\nShe's just a distraction, I confess\n\nShe'll never take up the space that you left\n\nJust a distraction, I confess\n\nSomeone to hold who can help me forget, yeah\n\n\n\nShe may have my attention\n\nBut we got no connection\n\nJust need to take my mind\n\nOff you, yeah\n\nShe may have my attention\n\nBut we got no connection\n\nJust need to take my mind\n\nOff you\n\n\n\nShe's just a distraction, I confess\n\nShe'll never take up the space that you left\n\nJust a distraction, I confess\n\nSomeone to hold who can help me forget, yeah\n\n\n\nShe may have my attention\n\nBut we got no connection\n\nJust need to take my mind\n\nOff you, yeah\n\nShe may have my attention\n\nBut we got no connection\n\nJust need to take my mind\n\nOff you",
