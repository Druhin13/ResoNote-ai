  "lyrics": "Starin' through a spiderweb where the windshield used to be\r\nWhat's left of the dashboard, the smell of gasoline\r\nI can just make out one neon light south off through the trees\r\nMy feet took over walkin' 'fore my mind caught up with me\r\nWhen I walked in my tab was already open\r\nMy drink was poured and my cigarette was smokin'\n\n\n\nSomebody said \"Hey girl, where you been? Doncha know I been waitin' for ya?\n\n\"Got a band up there been dyin' to play a little 'Devil Went Down to Georgia'\n\n\"Rest that trav'lin' soul, looks like the road was long\n\n\"Welcome to Southern Babylon\"\n\n\n\nHad to pull myself together and ask to use the phone\n\nThe waitress smiled a wicked grin, it sent a chill right through my bone\n\nI said \"I need to call the tow-truck, some way to move along\"\n\nShe said, \"Who you wanna call now that you've been called home?\"\n\n\n\nShe said \"Hey girl, where you been? Doncha know I been waitin' for ya?\n\n\"You got a band up there just dyin' to play a little 'Hotel California'\n\n\"And maybe it's not sinkin' in, but you'll learn to play along\n\n\"Honey, you been gone since you walked into Southern Babylon\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm not supposed to be here, bartender don't you see?\n\n\"I took a gig down in Atlanta and the brakes gave out on me\"\n\nShe said, \"We know all about ya. It's a little bit too late\"\n\nShe handed me a guitar and pointed to the flames\n\n\n\n\"Hey girl, where you been? Doncha know I been waitin' for ya?\n\n\"You got a band up there just dyin' to play a little 'Devil Went Down to Georgia'\n\n\"Rest that trav'lin' soul, looks like the road was long\n\n\"Welcome to Southern Babylon\"\n\nSouthern Babylon\n\nWelcome to Southern Babylon\n\nWelcome home",
