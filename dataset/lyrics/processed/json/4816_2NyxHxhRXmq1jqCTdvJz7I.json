Abe Lincoln\n\nVil still spend stacks off crack, stay crinklin'\n\nThis game's built to get got while blinkin'\n\nRappers do big up jail like a recruiter\n\nGame lieutenant hit a boy, said he wasn't shooter\n\nTold him \"Man up, or keep the pussy like a scooter\"\n\nThen said nuttin' and didn't pass the Buddha\n\nWhat do you know, police shows up?\n\nSpit his shitty sixteen and get hisself locked up, up\n\nHis story had a moral, he's buried in the soil\n\nVil put it in her back like a epidural\n\nKids: eat, sleep, stay away from creeps\n\nSpit it from the heart, this game's for keeps\n\n\n\nPut you in the dirt like a garden gnome, hard as stone lies\n\nSynchronized like the steps of a marching Clone legion\n\nRuthless, my troops is from parts unknown\n\nLike a minor human torch, arson prone\n\nMy field is a minefield\n\nBombs left and right knobs\n\nIt's stormin', kite, sign sealed with divine shield\n\nEven Nick Fury keeps his eye peeled\n\nWolverine's mutant gene, hoping time heals\n\nFiring Irish girls up me like Notre Dame\n\nWhile you're ripped and you're a sucker 'cause you can't say no to dames\n\nAnd you're like novacane 'cause I can't fear now\n\nCome on, give me some credit\n\nI never say some bullshit everyone else think I'm apathetic\n\nBeat the rhyme sharp and tight\n\nLeave the mind archetype darker than an Arkham Knight",
