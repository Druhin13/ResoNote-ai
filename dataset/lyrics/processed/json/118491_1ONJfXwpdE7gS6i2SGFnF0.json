  "lyrics": "I get up in the evening, and I ain't got nothing to say\r\nI come home in the moring, I go to bed feeling the same way\r\nI ain't nothing but tired, man I'm just tired and bored with myself\r\nHey there baby, I could use just a little help \nYou can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark\n\nThis gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark\n\n\n\nMessages keeps getting clearer, radio's on and I'm moving round the place\n\nI check my look in the mirror I wanna change my clothes my hair my face\n\nMan I ain't getting nowhere i'm just living in a dump like this\n\nThere's something happening somewhere baby I just know that there is\n\n\n\nYou can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark\n\nThis gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark\n\n\n\nYou sit around getting older there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me\n\nI'll shake this world off my shoulders come baby this laughs on me \n\nStay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up alright\n\nThey say you got to stay hungry hey baby I'm just about starving tonight\n\nI'm dying for some action I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write\n\nthis book\n\nI need a love reaction come on now baby give me just one look\n\n\n\nYou can't start a fire, sitting around crying over a broken heart\n\nThis gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark\n\n\n\nYou can't start a fire, worrying about your little world falling apart\n\nThis gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark\n\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\n\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\n\nEven if we're just dancing in the dark\n\n\n\nHey baby!",
