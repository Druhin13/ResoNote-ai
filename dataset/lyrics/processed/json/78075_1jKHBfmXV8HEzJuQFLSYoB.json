Uh\n\nLet one of your skeletons catch up with you\n\n\n\nKeep your head up, your back strong\n\nJust follow your heart, son\n\nAnd nothing can go wrong, yeah\n\nGo fuck him up, boy\n\nKeep your head up, your back strong\n\nJust follow your heart, son\n\nAnd nothing can go wrong, yeah\n\nGo fuck him up, boy",
