  "lyrics": "I feel so empty and alone, I wonder\r\nIf this is ever going to go away\r\nCause now this changes everything\r\nSmash all your sacred cows\r\nBreak all your sacred vows\n\nNever look down on me\n\nWhat you get, what you see\n\nI could never be another brick in the wall\n\nYou’ll remember me\n\nAs you break all our spirits down and push us to the ground\n\nCall me a fool with a gasoline can\n\nBurn it fucking down, start it over and over again\n\n\n\nWhenever I fall\n\nIf ever at all\n\nYou’re there to watch me crumble\n\nAnd just like a muse\n\nA drug I abuse\n\nYou’re there to watch me crumble\n\nBut you won’t get your chance\n\n\n\nAnd so I sink into the grey horizon\n\nI’m never going to let you say “I can’t”\n\nI’ll never let you beat me to the ground\n\n\n\nSo can you see the hunger in my eyes?\n\nTake a look, it’s no disguise\n\nGot to crush my struggles, crush the pain and the strife\n\nLive or die, I'm gonna fight for my life tonight\n\n\n\nWhenever I fall\n\nIf ever at all\n\nYou’re there to watch me crumble\n\nAnd just like a muse\n\nA drug I abuse\n\nYou’re there to watch me crumble\n\nBut you won’t get your chance\n\nYou’ll never get your chance\n\n\n\nThe only thing keeping me sane\n\nThe music in my veins\n\nAnd if these words are my fists\n\nCan you feel my catharsis?\n\n\n\nCan, you, feel my catharsis\n\nCan, you, feel my catharsis\n\nThe only thing keeping me sane\n\nThe music in my veins\n\nAnd if these words are my fists\n\nThis is my catharsis\n\n\n\nWhenever I fall\n\nIf ever at all\n\nYou’re there to watch me crumble\n\nAnd just like a muse\n\nA drug I abuse\n\nYou’re there to watch me crumble\n\n\n\nBut you won’t get your chance\n\nYou’ll never get your chance\n\n\n\nThe only thing keeping me sane\n\nThe music in my veins\n\nAnd if these words are my fists\n\nCan you feel my catharsis?\n\n\n\nThis is my catharsis!",
