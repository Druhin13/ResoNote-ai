  "lyrics": "Your name on the screen, are you thinking of me?\r\nOr falling back into the same old habits?\r\nYou're back the place that you said you hated\r\nJust hoping that we'll run into each other\r\nYeah, making bad choices\n\nWhen you shoulda gone home, well\n\nI can't be the only one who tries so hard to shake it off\n\nMaking bad choices when you feel a bit lonely\n\nWell, I can't be the only one\n\nThe only one who feels a little\n\n\n\nLost, when I think of us\n\nWhen I thought that I just forgot\n\nThen I mess it up\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's\n\nLost, when I think of us\n\nWhen I thought that I just forgot\n\nThat I'm missing us\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's lost\n\n\n\nWake up from a dream, are you dreaming of me?\n\nAlthough you go to bed with someone new, no, yeah\n\nAll the memories were made, could you throw them away\n\nOr just put them somewhere safe where no one finds out?\n\n\n\nYeah, making bad choices\n\nWhen you shoulda gone home, well\n\nI can't be the only one who tries so hard to shake it off\n\nMaking bad choices when you feel a bit lonely\n\nWell, I can't be the only one\n\nThe only one who feels a little\n\n\n\nLost, when I think of us\n\nWhen I thought that I just forgot\n\nThen I mess it up\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's\n\nLost, when I think of us\n\nWhen I thought that I just forgot\n\nThat I'm missing us\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's\n\n\n\nLost in my mixed emotions\n\nOceans of feeling hopelessly lost, so lost\n\nLost in my mixed emotions\n\nOceans of feeling hopelessly lost, so lost\n\n\n\nI know that you wanted me\n\nThe fact that you missing it\n\nThe good and the bad\n\nThe over dramatic but love that we had\n\nKnow that you never tell\n\nYou're keeping it to yourself\n\nBut I can't be the only one who's\n\n\n\nThe only one who feels a little\n\nLost, when I think of us\n\nWhen I thought that I just forgot\n\nThen I mess it up\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's\n\nLost, when I think of us\n\nWhen I thought that I just forgot\n\nThat I'm missing us\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's\n\n\n\nLost in my mixed emotions\n\nOceans of feeling hopelessly lost, so lost\n\nLost in my mixed emotions\n\nOceans of feeling hopelessly lost\n\n\n\nWell, I can't be the only one who's lost",
