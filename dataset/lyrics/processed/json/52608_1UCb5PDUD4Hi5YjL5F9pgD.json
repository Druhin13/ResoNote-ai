  "lyrics": "I acknowledged my sin to You and I did not cover my iniquity\nThere's no way to hide from Your all seeing eyes\nYou know everything I can't tell You a lie\nYou know my own heart much better than I\nYou know when I sleep and You know when I rise\nYou know all the thoughts that go through my mind\n\nFrom morning to night every moment of pride, Hey!\n\nI acknowledged my sin to You and I did not cover my iniquity\n\nYou know what I've done, You know what I do\n\nSo I open my mouth and confess it to You\n\nAnd You're making me new, it's Your Spirit at work\n\nTo convict me of sin so I know where to turn\n\nAnd I know where to run,\n\nRun to Your arms to be cleansed of my sin by the blood of\n\nYour Son, Hey!\n\nI acknowledge my sin, I know I can't kill it with a knife or\n\na gun\n\nIt must be crucified on the cross with Your Son\n\nThen I can know that it's finished and done\n\nThen I can know that I'm truly forgiven and get to the\n\nbusiness of living for You\n\nAnd it's not for my glory but only for You\n\nAnd it speaks of Your mercy, Your love and Your truth\n\nGive me the faith to believe what You say\n\nAnd to trust in Your Word when I'm tempted to stray\n\nAnd to patiently wait for the day You return\n\nI hate my sin it burns but\n\n\n\nOh God my sin is great, there's no escaping it\n\nI hate my sin but I still partake in it\n\nI've become numb to the touch from feeling it\n\nI've learned the art and skill of concealing it\n\nI might pretend and keep my composure\n\nHoping never to disclose the truth that it exposes\n\nAnd even though nobody around me knows it\n\nGod, You notice it\n\nAnd when I'm alone it shows it\n\nI do a good job doing good deeds\n\nLook the right part because I say the right things\n\nTrust in Your Word, and what's best for me\n\nBut it seems that I still live in disbelief\n\nI begin to better understand confession\n\nWhen I understand the weight of my sin and its' effect\n\nAnd how it's a direct reflection of my selfishness\n\nAnd recognize Your correct assessment\n\nI don't have to hide behind my own pride\n\nTear myself up from the guilt inside\n\nBecause I've been given everything I've ever needed\n\nTo stand clean and forgiven when I received Jesus so\n\n\n\nThe old will pass away, while I'm still here You hear my\n\nprayer\n\nPlease, wash my sins away, oh Lord, release me from this\n\nsnare",
