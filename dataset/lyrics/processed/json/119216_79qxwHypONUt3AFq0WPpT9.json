  "lyrics": "When it rain it pours but you didn't even notice\r\nIt ain't rainin' anymore, It's hard to breathe when all we know is\r\nThe struggle of staying above, the rising water line\r\nThe sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowin'\r\nBut you're stuck out in the same old storm again\n\nHold tight to your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya\n\nThat there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\n\n\n\nIf you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colours\n\nYellow, red and orange and green, and atleast a million others\n\nTie up your bow, take off your coat and take a look around\n\n\n\n'Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blown'\n\nBut you're stuck out in the same old storm again\n\nHold tight to your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya\n\nThat there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\n\n\n\nSo tie up your bow, take off your coat and take a look around\n\nEverything is alright now\n\n'Cause the sky is finally open, the rain and wind stopped blowin'\n\nBut you're stuck out in the same old storm again\n\nLet go of your umbrella, darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya\n\nThat there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head\n\nYeah there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head",
