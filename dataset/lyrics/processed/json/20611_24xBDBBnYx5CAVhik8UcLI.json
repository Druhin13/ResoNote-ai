  "lyrics": "Another Friday night I'm somewhere\r\nA little drunk and worn out from the show\r\nIt's a hallway to a hotel room\r\nThe truck's already rolling down the road\r\nI find the lights take off my coat\r\nI see her there just lying on the bed\n\nShe's seen me through my yesterdays\n\nGod knows tonight I'm needing her again\n\n\n\nShe's the place I go\n\nWhen there's nowhere left to run to\n\nShe's the one I hold\n\nWhen there's no one to hold on to\n\n\n\nShe's been with me late at night\n\nWhen I was drowning in the dark\n\nShe heard my every word\n\nWhen I was pouring out my heart\n\nSo I thank my lucky stars\n\nFor every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar\n\n\n\nShe's given me her best\n\nWhen I am at my worst\n\nWhen I can't find the pieces\n\nFingers scratching in the dirt\n\nShe offers no forgiveness\n\nCause she likes to make it hurt\n\n\n\nShe's the place I go\n\nWhen there's nowhere left to run to\n\nShe's the one I hold\n\nWhen there's no one to hold on to\n\n\n\nShe's been with me late at night\n\nWhen I was drowning in the dark\n\nShe heard my every word\n\nWhen I was pouring out my heart\n\nSo I thank my lucky stars\n\nFor every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar\n\n\n\nMorning like a freight train\n\nLast night still ringing in my head\n\nBefore today becomes tomorrow\n\nTonight I know I'll do it all again\n\n\n\nShe's the place I go\n\nWhen there's nowhere left to run to\n\nShe's the one I hold\n\nWhen there's no one to hold on to\n\n\n\nShe's been with me late at night\n\nWhen I was drowning in the dark\n\nShe heard my every word\n\nWhen I was pouring out my heart\n\nSo I thank my lucky stars\n\nFor every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar\n\nAnd so I thank my lucky stars\n\nFor every crack, scratch and scar on this guitar",
