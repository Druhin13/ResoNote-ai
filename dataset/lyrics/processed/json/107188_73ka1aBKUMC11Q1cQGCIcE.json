  "lyrics": "Hi there, how are ya ? It's been a long time \nSeems like we've come a long way \nMy, but we learn so slow And heroes they come and they go \nAnd leave us behind As if we're s'posed to know-why \nWhy do we give up our hearts to the past ? \nAnd why must we grown up so fast ? \n\nAnd all you wishing-well fools with your fortunes \n\nSomeone should send you a rose With love from a friend \n\nIt's nice to hear from you again And the storybooks comes to a close \n\nGone are the ribbons and bows \n\nThings to remember, places to go \n\nAnd pretty maids all in a row",
