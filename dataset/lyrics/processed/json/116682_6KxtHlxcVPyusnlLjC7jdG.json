  "lyrics": "Storm rolled in to our surprise\r\nIt doesn't rain under the tall trees\r\nYou were my love, you were my tree\r\nYou would always protect me\r\nIt's easier to take a heart than let your own be taken\r\nI love that little smile you keep in the corner of your mouth\n\nAnd is it hard to see me go?\n\nDoing things the wrong way\n\nIf you're here, when I fall\n\nI know I won't fall a long way\n\nA long way\n\n\n\nWe were talking on the phone\n\nI stepped out into the hallway\n\nMy face was frozen on the screen\n\nAnd you started laughing\n\nPut a cone through your hair\n\nAnd a clean shirt on\n\nThere's people come 'round here soon\n\nEveryone, act normal\n\nBig trees fall all the time\n\nThey crack and sound like lightning\n\nLeave a big space in your sky when they fall\n\nWhen they fall a long way\n\nA long way\n\n\n\nPick me up\n\nFill my cup now\n\nTake me down, down to where we start\n\nLet's go too far now\n\nAll tangled up\n\nTake me down, down to where we start\n\nDown to where we start\n\nWhere we start",
