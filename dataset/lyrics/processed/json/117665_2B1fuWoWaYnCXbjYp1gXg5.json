(Goes on)\r\nI know I’ll see you tomorrow\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm bad to lettin’ you go, lettin' you go\n\nLettin' you go, lettin' you go\n\nMoving on, moving on, moving on, moving on\n\nI'm ready to go, ready to go\n\nI'm ready to throw, ready to throw\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\n\n\nHow many tears do we have to cry?\n\nHow many sleepless, lonely nights?\n\nTo work it up, is it worth enough?\n\nShould we go ahead? Or should we turn around?\n\nI know I’ll see you tomorrow\n\n\n\n’Cause I'm bad to lettin’ you go, lettin' you go\n\nLettin' you go, lettin' you go\n\nMoving on, moving on, moving on, moving on\n\nI’m ready to go, ready to go\n\nI'm ready to throw, ready to throw\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\n\n\nJust because it isn't easy doesn't means that it's wrong\n\nEverything that we've been working on, working on so long\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang (Ooh)\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\nYou're my booma-booma-rang-rang\n\nLettin' you go, lettin' you go (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nLettin' you go, lettin' you go (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nMoving on, moving on (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nMoving on, moving on (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nReady to go, ready to go (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nI'm ready to throw, ready to throw\n\nYou're my boomerang-rang\n\nYou're my boomerang-rang\n\nLettin' you go, lettin' you go (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nLettin' you go, lettin' you go (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nMoving on, moving on (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nMoving on, moving on (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nReady to go, ready to go (Booma-rang-rang)\n\nI'm ready to throw, ready to throw\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang\n\nYou're my boomerang-boomerang",
