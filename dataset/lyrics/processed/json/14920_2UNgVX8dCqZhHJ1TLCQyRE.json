  "lyrics": "Over and over I blame this on myself\r\nThe high came before you no matter the lies I tell\r\nI don't feel ten feet tall\r\nDark side of the wall\r\nLosing all control\r\nFeel so miserable\n\n\n\nOver and over I blame this on myself\n\n\n\nBrain numb feel so strange\n\nWanna die before I change\n\nSlow me down anesthetic taste\n\nSingin in the swamp I made\n\n\n\nStrung out on dealing with kissing the Devil's mouth\n\n\n\nI don't feel ten feet tall\n\nDark side of the wall\n\nLosing all control\n\nFeel so miserable\n\n\n\nBrain numb feel so strange\n\nWanna die before I change\n\nSlow me down anesthetic taste\n\nSingin in the swamp I made\n\n\n\nI've met the devil, she reminds me of god\n\nShe's the reason I'm still laying with the dogs\n\n\n\nI'm so brain numb feel so strange\n\nWanna die before I change\n\nSlow me down anesthetic taste\n\nSingin in the swamp I made",
