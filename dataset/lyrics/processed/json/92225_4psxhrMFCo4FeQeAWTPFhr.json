  "lyrics": "Sometimes its hard to breathe\r\nAll the thoughts are shouting at me\r\nTryna bring me to my knees\r\nAnd its overwhelming\r\nDarkness echoes all around\r\nFeels like everything is crashing down\n\nStill I know when my hope is found\n\n\n\nAnd it's only you and ooo\n\nYou say you're working everything for my good and\n\nI believe every word\n\n\n\n'Cause even in the madness, there is peace\n\nDrowning out the voices all around me\n\nThrough all of this chaos\n\nYou were writing a symphony, a symphony\n\nAnd even in the madness, there is peace\n\nDrowning out the voices all around me\n\nThrough all of this chaos\n\nYou were writing a symphony, a symphony\n\n\n\nTo my heart, do you beat?\n\nLet me be your melody\n\nEven when I cannot see\n\nBut you orchestrate it\n\nEven when the dark surrounds\n\nYou'll never let me drown\n\nI know that my hope is found\n\nIn the name of Jesus\n\n\n\nYou say you're working everything for my good and\n\nI believe every word\n\n\n\n'Cause even in the madness, there is peace\n\nDrowning out the voices all around me\n\nThrough all of this chaos\n\nYou were writing a symphony, a symphony\n\nAnd even in the madness, there is peace\n\nDrowning out the voices all around me\n\nThrough all of this chaos\n\nYou were writing a symphony, a symphony\n\n\n\nI wanna truly know\n\nIf you can pause beauty\n\nMusic though\n\nFrom all my unruly notes\n\nIt's distant, it's moving close\n\nNow I see\n\nErase the scales from my eyes\n\nThen play the scale of my life\n\n[?] with chord for chord through strife and\n\nI've tasted suffering\n\nI've been embraced by the painful buffering\n\nI've been down by doubt, so loud right now\n\nBut I'm better when you play these rusty keys\n\nSo we all gotta get pressed\n\nTuned up like instruments\n\nBut I know our lives ?\n\nWhenever we remember this\n\n\n\nThat even in the madness, there is peace\n\nDrowning out the voices all around me\n\nThrough all of this chaos\n\nYou were writing a symphony, a symphony\n\nAnd even in the madness, there is peace\n\nDrowning out the voices all around me\n\nThrough all of this chaos\n\nYou were writing a symphony, a symphony",
