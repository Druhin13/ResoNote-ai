  "lyrics": "I got a fast car, gassed up, sitting in the drive way\r\nGot a road that I know like the back of my hand\r\nWe could head out right now, baby, we could fly away\r\nDisappear outta here fast as we can\r\nOoo, I miss you, baby\n\nOoo, I'm going crazy\n\n\n\nThere's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town\n\nWith the moon hanging for me and you, baby\n\nWe can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around\n\nKill the space in between, slide across that leather seat\n\nHeart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do\n\nIs get closer, closer, closer to you\n\nCloser to you\n\n\n\nWanna taste that great wide open freedom\n\nWanna make the distance razor thin\n\nWanna feel you feel me feel you breathing\n\nTill we can't tell where you end and where I begin\n\n\n\nThere's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town\n\nWith the moon hanging for me and you, baby\n\nWe can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around\n\nKill the space in between, slide across that leather seat\n\nHeart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do\n\nIs get closer, closer, closer to you\n\nCloser to you\n\n\n\nOoo, I miss you, baby\n\nOoo, I'm going crazy\n\n\n\nThere's a diamond sky that's waiting for us just outside of town\n\nWith the moon hanging for me and you, baby\n\nWe can cut the headlights out when there ain't no one else around\n\nKill the space in between, slide across that leather seat\n\nHeart to heart, face to face, you know all I wanna do\n\nIs get closer, closer, closer to you\n\nCloser to you\n\nCloser, closer, closer to you\n\nCloser to you",
