  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Friends We Met Online par Joyce Manor\r\nYou and I were members of the same online community\nI know that it sounds kinda lame when I say it out loud\nBut it’s true we met there\nIt’s where we spent most of our time\nTalking to friends, friends that we met online\nAnd you were always there for me when I was feeling kinda lonely\nI think of things you said to me all the time\nYeah sure we met there, it's a really big part of our lives\nTalking to friends, friends that we met online\n\nSome people go to bars at night\nSome people go to sleep\n\nSome people live in big apartments\nStill they're giving you the creeps\nI sit up in my bed at night sick to my cyber soul\nHow you ever gonna teach me something I don't even wanna know\n\nHow can we misremember such sad horrible times\nTalking to friends, friends that we made online\nFriends that we met online\nFriends that we met online\nFriends that we met online",
