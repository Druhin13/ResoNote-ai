You're crazy, babe\n\nExcuse me, you must be out your mind, baby\n\nBut you got the right one this time, I\n\nYou got me fucked up\n\n\n\nWhy you do this to me\n\nWhen you know how I felt?\n\nEvery time I touch, your skin getting melted\n\nBut you freeze quickly, I swear you so cold\n\nWhen I'm in my head, that's when I miss you the most\n\n\n\nYou had it easy but you just couldn't play your part\n\nOur heart was starving while you focused on so many parts\n\nOut of the line, it's way too old to be acting up, ay\n\n\n\nSo excuse me, what's your problem?\n\nWhy you so mad? You're crazy, babe\n\nExcuse me, you must be out your mind, baby\n\nBut you got the right one this time, I\n\nYou got me fucked up\n\n\n\nAin't a shame that we started in peace\n\nEnded in flames?\n\nDon't wanna say that it's over and done\n\nBut I like it this way\n\n\n\nYou had it easy but you just couldn't play your part\n\nOur heart was starving while you focused on so many parts\n\nOut of the line, it's way too old to be acting up, ay\n\n\n\nSo excuse me, what's your problem?\n\nWhy you so mad? You're crazy, babe\n\nExcuse me, you must be out your mind, baby\n\nBut you got the right one this time, I\n\nYou got me fucked up",
