  "lyrics": "In my Prevost\r\nHeadin' down to Alabama\r\nI got a three night run\r\nWe're gonna kick it off in Birmingham\r\nHeadlights, wide lines\r\nFlying down 65\n\nTryna catch a few hours sleep\n\nTomorrow comes show time\n\nThat's when I know I'm\n\nLiving that neon dream\n\n\n\nOh I got the boys\n\nAnd the band\n\nAnd a one night stand\n\nWaiting on us down the road\n\nWe're gonna load it in\n\nCrank it to 10\n\nWhiskey shots at 2AM\n\nAnd off to another show\n\nAnd then it's back to my baby for\n\nA couple days\n\nBut I can only stay for so long\n\n'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home\n\n\n\nRolling into Mobile\n\nName on the marquee sign\n\nWaving at the women that are standing in the ticket line\n\nWell point me to the stage\n\nI know that's the only place I'm ever gonna wanna be\n\nSmoky bars, guitars\n\nBreakin' all the girls hearts\n\nThat's the only life for me\n\n\n\nOh I got the boys\n\nAnd the band\n\nAnd a one night stand\n\nWaiting on us down the road\n\nWe're gonna load it in\n\nCrank it to 10\n\nWhiskey shots at 2AM\n\nAnd off to another show\n\nAnd then it's back to my baby for\n\nA couple days\n\nBut I can only stay for so long\n\n'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home\n\n\n\nOh I got the boys\n\nAnd the band\n\nAnd a one night stand\n\nWaiting on us down the road\n\nWe're gonna load it in\n\nCrank it to 10\n\nWhiskey shots at 2AM\n\nAnd off to another show\n\nAnd then it's back to my baby for\n\nA couple days\n\nBut I can only stay for so long\n\n'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home\n\n'Til that Honky Tonk Highway's calling me home",
