  "lyrics": "Like a prisoner, waiting to be freed.\r\nLike an island from a far.\r\nWhen you listen to your soul, do you feel me?\r\nAnd do you hear me in your heart?\r\nMaybe I'm a dreamer,\n\nOr maybe I'm just fallen' apart.\n\nI put it all on the table for you to see,\n\nThat you and I, that's what we are.\n\n\n\nFrom this lonely coastline to New Orleans\n\nI may have lost my way, but I still\n\nKnow what it means to be\n\nLoved, by you, by you.\n\n\n\nWe're all just searching, for something new.\n\nBut I'm still waiting, waiting for you.\n\nWaiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you.\n\nWaiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you.\n\n\n\nLike a soldier, wounded in a war.\n\nLike the tide that washed away.\n\nDo you listen to yourself anymore,\n\nAnd do you hear me when I say?\n\n\n\nThat maybe I'm just lonely,\n\nOr maybe I'm just fallin' for you.\n\nOh, baby my heart is beating\n\nFrom the reasons that I always knew.\n\n\n\nFrom this lonely coastline to New Orleans\n\nI may have lost my way, but I still\n\nKnow what it means to be\n\nLoved, by you, by you.\n\n\n\nWe're all just searching, for something new.\n\nBut I'm still waiting, waiting for you.\n\nWaiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you.\n\nWaiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh, oh.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh, oh.\n\n\n\nFrom this lonely coastline to New Orleans\n\nI may have lost my way, but I still\n\nKnow what it means to be\n\nLoved, by you, by you.\n\n\n\nWe're all just searching, for something new.\n\nBut I'm still waiting, waiting for you.\n\nWaiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you.\n\nWaiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\n[Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you]\n\nOh, oh, ooohh, oh.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh, oh.\n\n[Waiting for you, I'm still, waiting for you]\n\n\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh, oh.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh.\n\nOh, oh, ooohh, oh.",
