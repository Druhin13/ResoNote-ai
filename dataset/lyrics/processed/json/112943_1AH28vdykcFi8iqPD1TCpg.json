  "lyrics": "Oh my holy lord\r\nSets my soul on fire\r\nFlames of love and sweet perfume\r\nShe's my heart’s desire\r\nShe's an angel straight from hell\r\nDraws me to the deep\n\nIn the darkness way below\n\nIt's my heart she’ll keep\n\n\n\nThunder underground\n\nWatch the castle fall\n\nSound of wind it takes the sky\n\nAnd winter takes us all\n\nMountain high against the sky\n\nWatches as we pray\n\nLaughing loud and smiling proud\n\nThis is where we lay\n\n\n\nLover\n\nLeaver\n\nTaker\n\nBeliever\n\n\n\nAll night hellfire\n\nErase your memories\n\nSo he'll fall to his knees\n\nWatch the fire blaze\n\nSatan plays his flute for him\n\nThe sound it burns his ears\n\nWatch his eyes\n\nHis piece of mind\n\nSlips and disappears\n\nLover\n\nLeaver\n\nTaker\n\nBeliever",
