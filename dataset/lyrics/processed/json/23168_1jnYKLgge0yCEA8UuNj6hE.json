  "lyrics": "Yo, Yo\r\nI sold my nigga these jordans\r\nJust so we could go on this date\r\nAnd you can do is bitch, about how I'm late\r\nI cut the container in half, 'cause I'm low on cash\n\nThe situation is bleak. It was strong, but our lovin' is weak\n\nI quit my job and my folks threw me out last week\n\nShit I can't even buy something to eat\n\nThe whole world had laughs\n\nBut Patrick let me crash on his couch\n\nIt was blue maybe green\n\nFirst night I made Daily Routine\n\nSaw that shit on Adidas\n\nI'm thinking \"niggas deadass got a chance to be on\"\n\nI ain't write this as no \"I have a Dream\" song\n\n\"Poor Nigga\" theme song\n\nI mean it can, if you want it to be\n\nI just thought I'd talk some more about me\n\nY'all niggas say he equal\n\nJust vibing with the people\n\nI'm scratching lottery tickets like, damn my nigga did we lose?\n\nLooking at my rent bill like, nigga did I move?\n\n\n\nWhen I was young, they asked my favorite color\n\nI'm thinking \"What the fuck do you mean?\"\n\nWhen we was all pure, I wasn't focused on green\n\nScreaming, \"take your crayons back\"\n\nThe only color that matters is black\n\nSee we live in a world of perspectives\n\nSee us in nice shit and they want us arrested\n\nI ain't go to school\n\nWe ain't have no electives\n\nTime's got erect\n\nWe ain't have no electric\n\nYour boss wonders why you ain't enthused\n\nAfter this $8.60 its back to the blues\n\nAfter this $8.60 its back to the blues\n\nBut its all about perspectives\n\nWe just smoke weed, wild out, and drive reckless\n\nMy niggas never listen to no Slipknot record\n\nI play 3-6 and get mad respect\n\nBut I'm feeling worthless\n\nNo money because I'm worthless\n\nThis the real world, what the fuck you was expecting",
