  "lyrics": "We fought at a rock show I walked out you didn't follow then I knew we were through\r\nIf I'm being honest my friends hated your ironic attitude, same for me it wasn't cute\r\nGuess I've been assuming that real life was like a movie but you didn't even give us a chance\r\nWhen all the good things happened you were absent and distracted not supportive\r\nYou acted mean and kinda bored\n\nI fall to a piece\n\nI can tell the heart breaks in degrees\n\nSmiling as I look back wondering why you took so long to see\n\n\n\nI never meant to call you\n\nBut then I went and called you twice\n\nI never meant to know you\n\nBut now I know the things you like and don't like\n\nAnd baby when I saw you\n\nI saw that we would crash and burn\n\nI went to every school but\n\nI never really learned\n\n\n\nLove notes on the table I was broken and disabled by the pain by the pain\n\nLike it was a mantra kept repeating all the drama we created it was our baby\n\nFound myself concealing tiny secrets with no meaning cause it gave a strange sensation of control\n\nSaid you would protect me but I'm stronger now you've left me after all after all\n\n\n\nI fall to a piece\n\nI can tell the heart breaks in degrees\n\nSmiling as I look back knowing that you took nothing from me\n\n\n\nI never meant to call you\n\nBut then I went and called you twice\n\nI never meant to know you\n\nBut now I know the things you like and don't like\n\nAnd baby when I saw you\n\nI saw that we would crash and burn\n\nI went every school but\n\nI never really learned\n\n\n\nI'll just turn around and let it out\n\nFace in hands and cry it out\n\nI'm gonna turn around and let it out\n\nFace in hands and cry it out\n\nI'm gonna turn around and let it out\n\nFace in hands and\n\n\n\nI never meant to call you\n\nBut then I went and called you twice\n\nI never meant to know you\n\nBut now I know the things you like and don't like\n\nAnd baby when I saw you\n\nI saw that we would crash and burn\n\nI went every school but\n\nI never really learned",
