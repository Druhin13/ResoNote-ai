  "lyrics": "Red lights and it’s a jungle out there\r\nSo hard, you can’t take it\r\nAll of the warriors go into battle\r\nTaking you for the ride\r\nYou’re no fighter\r\nBut you fake it\n\n\n\nThat night, when you fought me away\n\nYou said, “Someday, we could make it”\n\n\n\nAll the same, we never knew\n\n‘Cause we want what we want\n\nWhen we want what we want\n\n\n\n\n\nSo don’t take it back\n\nIf that’s what you mean\n\nDon’t make me think you care any longer\n\nYou got needs, and I have mine\n\nIt’s a jungle out there\n\nAnd we’re right to fight\n\nLeaving only memories of us\n\nBreathing in the other’s air\n\nDon’t take it back if that’s what you mean\n\nIt’s a jungle out there\n\n\n\n\n\nI want out, but still your body blocks the door\n\nIs it me that you need, or the one that you knew when we were rolling on the floor\n\nNo one cries for who they were\n\nThey’re just songs from the past\n\nThey belong to the past\n\n\n\nSo don’t take it back\n\nIf that’s what you mean\n\nDon’t make me think you care any longer\n\nYou got needs, and I have mine\n\nIt’s a jungle out there\n\nAnd we’re right to fight\n\nLeaving only memories of us\n\nBreathing in the other’s air\n\nDon’t take it back if that’s what you mean\n\nIt’s a jungle out there\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the same, we never knew\n\n‘Cause we want what we want\n\nWhen we want what we want\n\n\n\nSo don’t take it back\n\nIf that’s what you mean\n\nDon’t make me think you care any longer\n\nYou got needs, and I have mine\n\nIt’s a jungle out there\n\nAnd we’re right to fight\n\nLeaving only memories of us\n\nBreathing in the other’s air\n\nDon’t take it back if that’s what you mean\n\nIt’s a jungle out there\n\n\n\nSo don’t take it back\n\nDon’t take it back\n\nDon’t take it back\n\nLa da da da\n\nDon’t take it back\n\nDon’t take it back\n\nDon’t take it back\n\nLa da da da, da da",
