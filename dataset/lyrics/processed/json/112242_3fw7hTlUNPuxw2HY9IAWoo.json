  "lyrics": "That bastard had a head like a matchstick\r\nFace like he was sucking concrete through a straw\r\n\"Some faces not even a mother can love.\"\r\nSays the spit and spatter of broken glass from above\r\n\"There's a tombstone where your headboard used to be.\"\r\nThey tell him every night before sleep\n\nEvery night before he dreams big and comes complete\n\nThen he sees himself floating high above the certainty of his feet\n\nSees some gutless worm, seeking a free ride inside the stomach of a whale\n\nHe can live without air for several days, he says\n\nHe says he knows things, this man, he says\n\nHe says he wouldn't wait for the light or the dark to fade\n\nHe says you'll want to move for the mouths of the damned elite\n\n\n\nTheir bodies are open\n\nTheir channels are open\n\nThis world is opening up\n\nUp, up, up\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm good for whatever.\"\n\nThe other smiles convinced\n\nTell me what's best and when. I'll save the date\n\nI'll set the tone, I'll wander in my sleep\n\nThey each raise a glass and clang\n\n\"Here's to what will\n\nHere's to the sharpened pencil\n\nSplitting the cast from the skin\n\nCuring the itch, curling the toes\n\nHere's to celebrity and fulfillment\n\nHere's to the top of the world\n\nHere's to a tired leaning wall\n\nHere's to the tragedy to ensue.\"\n\n\n\nTheir bodies are open\n\nTheir channels are open\n\nThis world is opening up\n\nUp, up, up\n\nTheir bodies are open\n\nTheir channels are open\n\nThis world is opening up\n\nUp, up, up, up, up\n\n\n\nToday's gonna feel like tomorrow, some day\n\nTomorrow's gonna feel like yesterday\n\nThis world is opening up\n\nThis world is opening up\n\nToday's gonna feel like tomorrow today\n\n(This world is opening up)\n\nTomorrow's gonna feel like yesterday\n\nToday's gonna feel like tomorrow today\n\n(This world is opening up)\n\nTomorrow's gonna feel like yesterday\n\nToday's gonna feel like tomorrow today\n\n(This world is opening up)\n\nTomorrow's gonna feel like\n\nGonna feel like\n\n(This world is opening up)\n\nIt's gonna feel like\n\n(This world is opening up)\n\nIt's gonna feel like\n\nIt's gonna feel like\n\n(This world is opening up)\n\nIt's gonna feel like\n\nIt's gonna feel like",
