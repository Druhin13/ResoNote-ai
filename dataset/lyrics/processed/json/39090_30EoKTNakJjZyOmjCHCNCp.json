  "lyrics": "Yeah, I had a dream I woke up happy\r\nThink I fell in Heaven, really prayed this everlastin'\r\nThere's no paradise on Earth\r\nKeep on reaching for the masses\r\nI'm so sorry, God, for who I've been, I swear this isn't me, no\r\nIs this me? 'Cause I don't feel like I'm alive\n\nI fell asleep drowning but I woke up in the sky\n\nCan't take back on my regrets, and sometimes that's why I cry\n\nYou don't see my scars, but you claim to know my life, right?\n\n\n\nWould you wanna go, would you wanna go (Yeah)\n\nWould you wanna go with me tonight? (With me tonight?)\n\nWould you wanna go, would you wanna go (Yeah)\n\nWould you wanna go with me tonight? (With me tonight?)\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna go with you tonight\n\nAnd I wanna go with you tonight\n\n\n\nI had a dream I woke up fearless\n\nNo worries in my brain, it feels good to feel something\n\nI want something real for once\n\nBeen a couple months since I've seen my best friends\n\nPray to God we keep in touch\n\n'Cause nowadays I don't know who to trust; nobody\n\nRemember when I was growing up and nobody\n\nNow a hundred thousand on my name who ride it 'til I feel happy\n\nGetting used to all this pain, I'm going on\n\n\n\nWould you wanna go, would you wanna go (Yeah)\n\nWould you wanna go with me tonight? (With me tonight?)\n\nWould you wanna go, would you wanna go (Yeah)\n\nWould you wanna go with me tonight? (With me tonight?)\n\n\n\nAnd I think I'm going with you tonight\n\nAnd I think I'm going with you tonight\n\n\n\nI had a dream I woke up, this is real\n\nThink I woke up in Heaven\n\nBelieved in You since the day I was seven\n\nI always thought it didn't count\n\nSince I was raised up in the church\n\nI'm back again, feels I'm Justin again\n\nI've been writing lyrics with some deeper substance again\n\nGettin' better, but I'm still losin' control\n\nI got issues and some demons that nobody would know, yeah\n\n\n\nWould you wanna go, would you wanna go (Yeah)\n\nWould you wanna go with me tonight? (With me tonight?)\n\nWould you wanna go, would you wanna go (Yeah)\n\nWould you wanna go with me tonight? (With me tonight?)",
