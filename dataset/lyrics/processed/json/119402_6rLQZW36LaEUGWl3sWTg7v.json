  "lyrics": "I see you standing at the front of the line\r\nWaiting for something I can't make out\r\nBut I wanna talk to you, to pull you aside\r\nI wanna ask you to come with me tonight\r\nI wanna stay by your side\n\nWhile we untangle\n\nThe world around\n\nIt's on fire\n\nI'm hearing sirens\n\nCalling me closer to you\n\n\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be\n\nI feel myself with you\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be\n\nI feel myself with you\n\n\n\nYou run your fingers through the palm of my hand\n\nPulling me closer, drawn by your command\n\nIt's like I've seen you, like I've known you before\n\nAn intuition that this is where I belong\n\nStanding with you in my arms\n\n\n\nWhile we untangle\n\nWorld around\n\nIt's on fire\n\nI'm hearing sirens\n\nCalling me closer to you\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be\n\n\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be\n\nI feel myself with you\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be\n\nI feel myself with you\n\nI feel myself with you",
