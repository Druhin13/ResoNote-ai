  "lyrics": "Close my eyes, rest my head on your pillow\r\nIt's getting cold on your side of the bed\r\nIt's been a while, I should lie in the middle\r\nIn the middle\r\nI still got these pictures of me and you\n\nAnd I say I'm tryna get over you\n\nBeen keeping busy on my own\n\nBut now all I wanna know\n\n\n\nDo ya think about me? Do ya, do ya think of me?\n\nDo ya think about me? Do ya, do ya think of me?\n\nDo you still wear my t-shirt?\n\nDo you still talk in your sleep?\n\nDo ya think about me? Do you ever think of me?\n\n'Cause I'm sick of loving, loving you\n\nI'm sick of hurting, hurting too\n\nBaby, do you ever think of me?\n\n'Cause I'm sick of loving, loving you\n\nI'm sick of hurting, hurting too\n\nBaby, do you ever, ever, ever think of me?\n\nDo you ever think of me, oh?\n\n\n\nDon't know why I ever thought it'd be easy\n\nSecond guessing only leads to regret\n\nOut of sight, out of mind then it hits me\n\nAnd when it hits me\n\n\n\nI break all these pictures of me and you\n\n'Cause I really wanna get over you now\n\nI say I'm busy on my own\n\nBut now all I wanna know\n\n\n\nDo ya think about me? Do ya, do ya think of me?\n\nDo ya think about me? Do ya, do ya think of me?\n\nDo you still wear my t-shirt?\n\nDo you still talk in your sleep?\n\nDo ya think about me? Do you ever think of me?\n\n'Cause I'm sick of loving, loving you\n\nI'm sick of hurting, hurting too\n\nBaby, do you ever think of me?\n\n'Cause I'm sick of loving, loving you\n\nI'm sick of hurting, hurting too\n\nBaby, do you ever, ever, ever think of me?\n\nDo you ever, ever, ever think of?\n\n\n\nOver you, over you\n\nThey say I'm not over you\n\nOver you\n\nI'm not, I'm not over you\n\nOver you\n\nThey say I'm not over you\n\nOver you\n\n\n\nDo ya think about me?\n\nDo ya think about me?\n\nDo ya think about me?\n\nDo ya think about me? Oh\n\nDo you ever, ever, ever think of?\n\n\n\nOver you, over you\n\nThey say I'm not over you\n\nOver you\n\nI'm not, I'm not over you\n\nOver you\n\nThey say I'm not over you\n\nOver you",
