And his court cost two thousand, damn\n\nAnd I don't even fuck wit' 'em, try to make Granny smile\n\nBut it's rough when my trust fucked up since I felt that way\n\nEverybody that I came up with fuck with me\n\nSince literally, talkin' ready, set, hut with me\n\nCame up, now I truly believe that they ain't never fuck with me\n\nTruly believe that I never needed nobody for nothin', fuck\n\n\n\nI believe that everybody needs a second chance\n\nI believe that men do what they want, boys what they can\n\nI believe that everyone should wear hearts on their sleeve\n\nThat's what I believe, man, that's what I believe\n\nI believe even dark souls will finally shine for something\n\nI believe we can make it up out this, been strugglin'\n\nI respect the man that gives it all or nothing\n\nThat's what I believe, man, that's what I believe",
