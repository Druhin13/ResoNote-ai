  "lyrics": "If there's a prize for rotten judgment\r\nI guess I've already won that\r\nNo man is worth the aggravation\r\nThat's ancient history; been there, done that\r\nWho d'you think you're kiddin'?\n\nHe's the earth and heaven to ya\n\nTry to keep it hidden\n\nHoney, we can see right through ya (Oh nooo)\n\nGirl, you can't conceal it\n\nWe know how you feel\n\nAnd who you're thinking of\n\n\n\nNo chance, no way\n\nI won't say it, no, no\n\n(You swoon, you sigh)\n\n(Why deny it? Uh-oh)\n\nIt's too clich√©\n\nI won't say I'm in love\n\n\n\nI thought my heart had learned its lesson\n\nIt feels so good when you start out\n\nMy head is screaming \"Get a grip, girl\n\nUnless you're dying to cry your heart out\"\n\n\n\n(Ohhh...)\n\nYou keep on denying\n\nWho you are and how you're feeling\n\nBaby, we're not buying\n\nHon, we saw you hit the ceiling\n\n(Oh, no)\n\nFace it like a grown-up\n\nWhen you gonna own up\n\nThat you got, got, got it bad?\n\n\n\nNo chance, no way\n\nI won't say it, no, no\n\n(Give up, give in)\n\n(Check the grin; you're in love)\n\nThis scene won't play\n\nI won't say I'm in love\n\n(You're doin' flips)\n\n(Read our lips: \"You're in love\")\n\n\n\nYou're way off base, I won't say it\n\nGet off my case, I won't say it\n\n(Girl, don't be proud!)\n\n(It's okay, you're in love)\n\n\n\nOhhh...\n\nAt least out loud\n\nI won't say I'm in love\n\n(Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do, shoo do)\n\n(Sha-la-la-la la la, ahh)",
