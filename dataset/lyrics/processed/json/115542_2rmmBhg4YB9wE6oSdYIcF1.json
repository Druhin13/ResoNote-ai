  "lyrics": "Like the frost on a rose\r\nWinter comes for us all\r\nOh how nature acquaints us\r\nWith the nature of patience\r\nLike a seed in the snow\r\nI've been buried to grow\n\nFor Your promise is loyal\n\nFrom seed to sequoia\n\n\n\nI know\n\n\n\nThough the winter is long even richer\n\nThe harvest it brings\n\nThough my waiting prolongs even greater\n\nYour promise for me like a seed\n\nI believe that my season will come\n\n\n\nLord I think of Your love\n\nLike the low winter sun\n\nAnd as I gaze I am blinded\n\nIn the light of Your brightness\n\nAnd like a fire to the snow\n\nI'm renewed in Your warmth\n\nMelt the ice of this wild soul\n\nTill the barren is beautiful\n\n\n\nAnd I know\n\n\n\nThough the winter is long even richer\n\nThe harvest it brings\n\nThough my waiting prolongs even greater\n\nYour promise for me like a seed\n\nI believe that my season will come\n\n\n\nI can see the promise\n\nI can see the future\n\nYou're the God of seasons\n\nAnd I'm just in the winter\n\nIf all I know of harvest\n\nIs that it's worth my patience\n\nThen if You're not done working\n\nGod I'm not done waiting\n\nYou can see my promise\n\nEven in the winter\n\nCause You're the God of greatness\n\nEven in a manger\n\nFor all I know of seasons\n\nIs that You take Your time\n\nYou could have saved us in a second\n\nInstead You sent a child\n\n\n\nThough the winter is long even richer\n\nThe harvest it brings\n\nThough my waiting prolongs even greater\n\nYour promise for me like a seed\n\nI believe that my season will come\n\n\n\nAnd when I finally see my tree\n\nStill I believe there's a season to come\n\n\n\nLike a seed You were sown\n\nFor the sake of us all\n\nFrom Bethlehem's soil\n\nGrew Calvary's sequoia",
