  "lyrics": "Stardust\r\nIn you and in me\r\nFuse us\r\nInto unity\r\nPrimeval\r\nWe're coupled\n\nBorn from the universe\n\nFarewell\n\nThe void is calling\n\nDon't fear\n\nFor futures and dreams\n\nThey're fleeting, retreating\n\nIt's ok. I promise\n\n\n\nI don't know what to say\n\nBut I'm going to want you till the stars evaporate\n\nWe're only here for just a moment in the light\n\nOne day it shines for us the next we're in the night\n\nSo say the word and I'll be running back to find you\n\nA thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through\n\nI'll soar the endless skies for only one sight\n\nOf your starlight\n\n\n\nTell me\n\nJust tell me to stay\n\nI'll turn\n\nI won't look away\n\nI'll stay here\n\nI'll never go but you don't feel the same\n\nFarewell\n\nFarewell and godspeed\n\nLight years\n\nBetween you and me\n\nI'm fading\n\nYour beauty conquers the darkness\n\n\n\nAt night the earth will rise\n\nAnd I'll think of you each time I watch from distant skies\n\nWhenever stars go down and galaxies ignite\n\nI'll think of you each time they wash me in their light\n\nAnd I'll fall in love with you again\n\nI will find you\n\nA thousand armies won't stop me I'll break through\n\nI'll soar the endless skies for only one sight of your starlight\n\n\n\nDon't leave me lost here forever\n\nShow me your starlight and pull me through\n\nDon't leave me lost here forever\n\nI need your starlight and pull me through\n\nBring me back to you",
