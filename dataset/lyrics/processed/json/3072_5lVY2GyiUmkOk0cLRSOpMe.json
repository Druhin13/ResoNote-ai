  "lyrics": "I don't feel afraid, walking on hot coals\r\nNo sensitivity in the fog of war\r\nTime to unwind, to enjoy the good life\r\nBut the pressure that I hold on my shoulders goes\r\nAnd I suspect the reason I am loved\r\nIs because it has tired of moving on\n\nNowadays I just want to talk problems on and on\n\nWhat ever happened to the old fashion strong and silent type\n\nWhat they didn't know is once you get us in\n\nTouch and I feel it, you would never give it in once you pull the pin\n\n\n\nI suspect the reason I am loved\n\nIs because of how tired I'm holding on\n\nIf I set you free, if I let go\n\nTell me would I still be the one you want\n\n\n\nEven my broken heart, is right twice a day\n\nEven your busting lie, can keep the thief away\n\nIt's not the type, so just don't go to hell\n\nIt's a place waits up for the kids that are evil\n\nNow you ask how I feel and I told you that\n\nThat you're gonna talk to me, slowly with end\n\n\n\nAnd I suspect the reason I am loved\n\nIs because of how tired I'm holding on\n\nIf I set you free, if I let go\n\nTell me would I still be the one you want\n\n\n\nI am falling behind, I am falling behind\n\nI'm falling, falling behind\n\n\n\nOh I suspect the reason I am loved\n\nSuspect the reason I am loved\n\nIf I set you free, if I let go\n\nTell me would I still be the one you want?",
