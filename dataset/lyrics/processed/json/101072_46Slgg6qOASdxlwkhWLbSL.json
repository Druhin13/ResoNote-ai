  "lyrics": "Bit and fat\rPig's supposed to look like that\rBarnyard thug\rSleep on straw and calls it a rug\rYeah that's a rug, ok\rHe's walking down the street\rAnd nobody's going to argue with him\rHe's a half-a-ton of pig meat\rUp in the hills above the farm\rLives a pack of wolves\rNever did a harm\rSleep all day\rHunt till four\rMaybe catch a couple of rodents\rYou know carnivore\rSheep in the meadow\rNibbling on some clover\rOne of the sheep wanders over\rSits by a rock\rSeparated from the flock\rHe's just sitting by a rock\rWhere'd he go?\rI don't know\rWell he was here a minute ago\rI don't know\rSheep's dead\rGot a gash as big as a wolf's head\rOh god\rBig and fat\rPig's supposed to look like that\rWallowing in lanolin\rHe's rubbing it into his pigskin\rPolice going crazy\rLet's get him\rLet's get that wolf\rLet's get him\rLet's get that wolf\rLet's get him\rLet's kill him, Let's get him\rLet's kill him\rCourt-appointed lawyer wasn't very bright\rOr maybe he was bright\rMaybe he just had a late night\rYeah it was just a late night\rAnd he files some feeble appeal\rAnd the governor says forget it\rIt's a done deal\rElection, I don't care, election\rLet's give that wolf a lethal injection\rLet's get him, yeah get him\rLet's kill him, Let's get him\rLet's kill him, Let's get him,kill him\rLet's get him and kill him\rWhew, slow\rHere comes the media\rSetting up their camera\rAsking everyone's opinion\rAbout pigs, sheep and wolves\rBig and fat\rPig's supposed to laugh like that\rThis is hilarious\rWhat a great time\rI'm the pig who committed\rThe perfect crime\rAll around the world\rFrance, Scandinavia\rThere's a candle light vigils\rProtesting this behavior\rIt's animal behavior\rAnimal behavior\rIt's Pig, sheep and wolves\rPig, sheep and wolves\rPig, sheep and wolves\rIt's animal behavior\rPig, sheep and wolves",
