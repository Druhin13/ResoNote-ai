  "lyrics": "Bury the tongue between the teeth\r\nOpen the jaw and sink in deep\r\nForce it open in cloud of greed\r\nDull throat, you let it sing, sing, sing, sing, sing\r\n(Let it sing don't let it hold you down)\n\n\n\nIn the static you were reborn\n\nIn the white nights, what you asked for\n\nFire, like you, and now conform\n\nGive you the marks over this war\n\n\n\nThe knife deep and spit down, swallow\n\nSmoother, knocking, impalpable\n\nSever in two and fuse to bone\n\n\n\nDull throat, you let it go",
