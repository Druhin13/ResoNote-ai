  "lyrics": "Buyin' bubbles, sellin' stones was the easy route\r\nMama stressin', it's a blessing just to see her smile\r\nPreachin' prison prevention but couldn't keep me out\r\nCame to visit, this ain't how I want you see your child\r\nChiefing loud, thinking back on how you kicked me out\r\nIt tripped me out but I just wiggled, you was wiggin' out\n\nI'm in your house at 25, sleepin' on the couch\n\nTold me get a job, I said I got it figured out\n\nThey see me down, ain't no way I let 'em keep me down\n\nLook around, things different ma, we peachy now\n\nWe eatin' now, this that shit I used to dream about\n\nWe on this baggage claim tour, you can keep the clout\n\nWhen you rise above the madness, pull your people out\n\nToo many claim to be the plug for it to be a drought\n\nFamily come before the fetty, ain't no keepin' count\n\nThe family come before the fetty, ain't no keepin' count\n\n\n\nEvery nigga that started with me was starvin' with me\n\nI was trapped in them trenches rockin' a bald glizzy\n\nGave my granny a hundred before I bought a Bentley\n\nTraumatic pain in my features, they say it compliment me\n\nThe consequences is fatal if you don't rock a yeeky\n\nMy geographics is greezy, they don't believe in Jesus\n\nKeep a distance from leeches, that ought to teach you somethin'\n\nTwo little girls, that's what keep me hustlin'\n\n\n\nI'm thinkin' Rollies when that backend clear\n\nI refuse to end up back on the tier, my biggest fear\n\nIt's been back to back, losin' my peers over the years\n\nConversate with Gracie and Mil like I can hear 'em\n\nThis shit serious, that yeeky is mandatory, period\n\nI had to learn from experience, crime boss appearance\n\nChase the luggage and secure it, probably blow it later\n\nShe don't want to see you with no paper, then that ho a hater\n\nCheckin' on you when I call, nigga I don't want no favor\n\nCheckin' on you when I call, nigga don't want no favor\n\nYou ain't really tryna ball, nigga don't want no paper\n\nYou ain't body nothin', niggas ain't on they gangster\n\nRemember I came from nothin', it was slummy for me\n\nThe city finally crowned me king, all these diamonds on me\n\nAyy, I'll die for one of mines, it's only righteous on me\n\nAnd I advise you not to try me homie, yeah\n\n\n\nEvery nigga that started with me was starvin' with me\n\nI was trapped in them trenches rockin' a bald glizzy\n\nGave my granny a hundred before I bought a Bentley\n\nTraumatic pain in my features, they say it compliment me\n\nThe consequences is fatal if you don't rock a yeeky\n\nMy geographics is greezy, they don't believe in Jesus\n\nKeep a distance from leeches, that ought to teach you somethin'\n\nTwo little girls, that's what keep me hustlin'\n\n\n\nMy mama pray I keep the sin away\n\nCan't say I believe in prayer, but she be prayin' anyway\n\nWhy the system set up to put my niggas away?\n\nWhen every risk we take is just to put it on the dinner plate\n\nAnd feed the fam, we're in a famine\n\nRiskin' freedom just to get established\n\nPeas in the pod, peas in the package\n\nWhy I only talk to God when I hope it's landing?\n\nHow selfish, I'm sick of the feeling of feeling helpless\n\nI'm sick of the fear, niggas is jealous\n\nI'm sick of feeling we only go as far as they let us\n\nWe sick of niggas who get some money and then forget us\n\nTryna play the game and you gon' play yourself\n\nYou can't save nobody 'til you save yourself\n\nSave yourself",
