  "lyrics": "In the dark, in the quiet now\r\nIt's too much for me to take\r\nTo feel alone as if there's no way out\r\nOh give me piece of mind today\r\nWhen the nights are long\n\nAnd the days go on\n\nI don't feel the same anymore\n\n\n\nIn the dark every lights gone out\n\nAnd there's nothing left to see\n\nI hear her voice softly calling out\n\nTo go the depth and feel the wait\n\n\n\nWhen the nights are long\n\nAnd the days go on\n\nI don't feel the same anymore\n\nWhen the nights are long\n\nAnd the days go on\n\nAnd you feel like home\n\n\n\nWhen the nights are long\n\nAnd the days go on\n\nI don't feel the same anymore\n\nWhen the nights are long\n\nAnd the days go on\n\nAnd you feel like home",
