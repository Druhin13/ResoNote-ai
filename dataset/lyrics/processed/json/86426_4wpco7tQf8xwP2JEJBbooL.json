  "lyrics": "If I could escape \nI would but, first of all, let me say\r\nI must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way\r\n'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor\r\nIt's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator\r\nMaybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?\n\n\n\nIf I could escape \n\nAnd recreate a place that's my own world\n\nAnd I could be your favorite girl (forever) \n\nPerfectly together\n\nTell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)\n\nIf I could be sweet (be sweet)\n\nI know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)\n\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever) \n\nWe can make it better\n\nTell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)\n\n\n\nI want to get away, get away, to our sweet escape\n\nI want to get away, yeah\n\n\n\nYou held me down, \n\nI'm at my lowest boiling point\n\nCome help me out, \n\nI need to get me out of this joint\n\nCome on let's bounce, \n\nCounting on you to turn me around\n\nInstead of clowning around, \n\nLet's look for some common ground\n\nSo baby, times get a little crazy, \n\nI've been gettin' a little lazy\n\nWaitin' on you to come save me\n\nI can see that you're angry \n\nBy the way that you treat me\n\nHopefully you don't leave me\n\nWanna take you with me\n\n\n\nIf I could escape \n\nAnd recreate a place that's my own world\n\nAnd I could be your favorite girl (forever) \n\nPerfectly together\n\nAnd tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)\n\nIf I could be sweet (be sweet)\n\nI know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)\n\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever) \n\nWe can make it better\n\nAnd tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)\n\n\n\nIf I could escape\n\nIf I could escape\n\n'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor\n\nIt's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator\n\nMaybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold\n\n\n\nIf I could escape \n\nAnd recreate a place that's my own world\n\nAnd I could be your favorite girl (forever) \n\nPerfectly together\n\nAnd tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (the sweet escape)\n\nIf I could be sweet\n\nI know I've been a real bad girl (I'll try to change)\n\nI didn't mean for you to get hurt (whatsoever) \n\nWe can make it better\n\nAnd tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)\n\n\n\nI want to get away, get away to our sweet escape\n\nI want to get away, yeah",
