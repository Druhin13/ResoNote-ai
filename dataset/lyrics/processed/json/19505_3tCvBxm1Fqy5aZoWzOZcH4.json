(oh yeah)\n\nCame from hand washing Bentleys, now a nigga is a owner (skrr)\n\nLife got rough, had to keep the Nina on him\n\nThen he met the hand cuffs, 'cause the homie told on 'em\n\nLife gave him lemons, and he made cream soda\n\n\n\nMa, a nigga be hustlin', we really countin' that cash\n\nA young niggas complainin', they broke and they lookin' bad\n\nBust down with my niggas, learnt that from my dad\n\nLil home one niggas runnin', bought the boy a new Jag\n\nIf I was you, I would hate too\n\nHard as fake club, I'd replace you (fuck you)\n\nGet your bands up, they wanna date you\n\nTryna

never do Coca-Cola (nah)\n\nWhen I hit that blunt, that you promise that I never be sober (heh)\n\nHad a dream like Dr. King, I was in love, this for the soda\n\nPicture perfect (picture), I paint the perfect pictures\n\nI know niggas that be hustlin', that do it with precision\n\nBitches sadity and pretty, knew she got some good intentions\n\nPrayin' to the ceilin', hope the Lord hear me (listen)\n\nYou gotta keep it one hunnid, like the emoji\n\nGotta stay focused (ah), know niggas that's when they chokers\n\nKnow niggas sit when they sober (ayy)\n\nBitches quick to put a spell on 'em, they get like hocus pocus\n\nDrive me crazy, like a dready\n\nMa said, \"don't eat that spaghetti\" (momma)\n\nYou can't cuff a bitch, save a hoe, that's what I was told (ooh)\n\nI got two hoes in my tepee like a Navajo (woah)\n\nBentley Mulsanne, bought all Bentleys in all gold (woah)\n\nI throw that shit away, I had to shoot a photo show (fuck it)\n\nAnd nah I ain't lyin' nigga (nah), they think this shit was easy\n\nThey didn't see the grind nigga (grind)\n\nSo many fake diamonds, I might as well shine nigga (shine)\n\nI mean no home, but I just came to take what's mine nigga\n\nNiggas

hunnid with all of my soldiers\n\n\n\nLook, I guess they label me a thug nigga\n\nGang bangin', hangin' with drug dealers\n\nPour an Eight up in a Twenty, I was on that mud nigga\n\nRemember paintin' pictures on my wall, in the cell\n\nWish I could thank everybody, that wrote a nigga mail\n\nKeep it a hunnid with my day ones\n\nAnd all them bitches with them fake ones, gonna shake some\n\nI still remember them bullets, when we hop in them gates\n\nAin't niggas run up in my crib, but couldn't crack a safe\n\nKeep it one hunnid, I know them niggas disappointed\n\nThem bitches horny, I know these diamonds make them want it\n\nThat pussy wet now, 'cause I'm throwin' all the hunnids\n\nNot throwin' shade hoe, I'm just keepin' it one hunnid\n\n\n\nPut your hands up in the air now, if you came up from nothin'\n\nKeep it one hunnid, all my niggas five hunnid\n\nSippin' Codeine, smokin' OG, that's that California love\n\nIt ain't right, but it ain't wrong\n\nRide or die, I keep it one hunnid\n\n\n\nYoung nigga on the corner, high on Marijuana\n\nMade a promise to his Momma, he would never be a stoner (yeah)\n\nMade a promise to the hood, he ain't never be a loner (oh yeah)\n\nCame
