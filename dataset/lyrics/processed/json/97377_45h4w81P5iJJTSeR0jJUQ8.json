  "lyrics": "Am I allowed to look at her like that?\r\nCould it be wrong, when she's just so nice to look at?\r\nAnd she smells like lemongrass and sleep\r\nShe tastes like apple juice and peach\r\nYou would find her in a polaroid picture\n\nAnd she means everything to me\n\n\n\nI'd never tell\n\nNo I'd never say a word\n\nAnd oh it aches\n\nBut it feels oddly good to hurt\n\n\n\nShe smells like lemongrass and sleep\n\nShe tastes like apple juice and peach\n\nYou would find her in a polaroid picture\n\nAnd she means everything to me\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be okay\n\nAdmiring from afar\n\nCause even when she's next to me\n\nWe could not be more far apart\n\nCause she tastes like birthday cake and storytime and fall\n\nBut to her\n\nI taste of nothing at all\n\n\n\nCause she smells like lemongrass and sleep\n\nShe tastes like apple juice and peach\n\nYou would find her in a polaroid picture\n\nAnd she means everything to me",
