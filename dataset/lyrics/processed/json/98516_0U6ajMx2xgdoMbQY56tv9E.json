  "lyrics": "I was wrong to say\r\nI wouldn't change a thing cause\r\nIn the story of our lives\r\nThe best of times\r\nThrough colour glass\r\n-\n\nAnd if you should call\n\nIt's no trouble, no trouble at all\n\nI'll paint out the sun\n\nBack where we begun again\n\n-\n\nTime, goes on\n\nEnough to let me move on past but\n\nEvery little now and then\n\nIt creeps on back to shape my smile\n\nI'm here once again\n\nAnd I'm dealing and I'm feeling the pain\n\nSo who takes the fall\n\nThat covers it all again?\n\n-\n\n[4x]\n\nPut it on the right track, get it right back\n\nA message from my heart is to allow it to stay apart\n\nSo put it on the right track, steal it right back\n\nIt's high time now",
