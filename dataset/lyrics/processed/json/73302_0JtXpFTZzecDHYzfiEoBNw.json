  "lyrics": "I ran into an old friend of mine the other day\r\nWe hadn't seen each other in quite a while\r\nWhat he had to say to me hit me pretty hard\r\nCause I think a lot of folks get started this way, He said,\r\nI thought It would be so easy, another one-nite-stand\n\nShe seemed so warm and willin', right in the palm of my hand\n\nIts been three months ago last Wednesday, since I woke up in her bed\n\nLord I think I love her, But it scares me half to death\n\n\n\nCHORUS:\n\nYou know I'm a rake and a ramblin' man,\n\nFree as an eagle flies,\n\nBut look at me now and tell me true,\n\nDo I look like a daddy to you?,\n\nOh, do I look like a daddy to you?\n\n\n\nNow she's feelin sick in the mornings, she can't get into her jeans\n\nI spent my last ten dollars, bought her second hand reams\n\nI start to work next Monday, cause I just can't let her down\n\nI've had me some good times, But its all changin' now",
