Wear her hair up?\n\nThe way that babe you always liked (always liked, always liked)\n\nWhen you're alone, does she know\n\nAll the ways to treat your body right? (right, yeah)\n\n\n\nI-I-I-I, I-I-I-I\n\nI saw on my feed\n\nShe looks a little like me\n\nI-I-I-I, I-I-I-I\n\nI can't help but see\n\nIt's not jealousy, no\n\n\n\nDamn, I heard that you and her been having problems\n\nShe likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common\n\nStarted at the top, and now you at the bottom\n\nBut baby, this is none of my business\n\nDamn, I heard that you and her been having issues\n\nI wish you the best, I hope that she can fix you\n\nYou'll be calling me the second that it hits you\n\nBut baby, this is none of my business\n\n\n\nNone of my business (no to the no, ah)\n\nHaven't watched your story in four days\n\nAt least not today\n\n'Cause it's none of my business\n\nNone of my business\n\n\n\nDamn, I heard that you and her been having problems\n\nShe likes to fight, I guess you both have that in common\n\nStarted at the top, and now you at the bottom\n\nBut baby, this is none of my business (yeah)\n\nDamn, I heard that you and her been having issues (oh)\n\nI wish you the best, I hope that she can fix you (you, you)\n\nYou'll be calling me the second that it hits you\n\nBut baby, this is none of my business",
