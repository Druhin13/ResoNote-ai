  "lyrics": "Our senses ache and bend\r\nWith the worldly winds and ephemeral disasters\r\nWe judge each mistake as if\r\nIt ruined our one chance for happy ever after\r\nAnd yeah, it’s easy to dream quite mindlessly\r\nWithout conscious regard\n\nBut what a noble deed to heed no voice\n\nExcept your heart\n\n\n\nThere may be gray skies\n\nBut when it rains I can feel the sunshine\n\nI feel the sunshine\n\nAnd that which I feel\n\nI know to be real\n\nThe vision I hold when winter’s so cold\n\nI can feel the sunshine\n\nI can feel the sunshine\n\n\n\nFigure and fact may state\n\nMay indicate that you have no hope\n\nAnd door after door may slam straight in your face\n\nBut you always know\n\nNot to define success by measurements you did not create\n\nAnd not to be fooled by rules\n\nThat have no bearing on your fate\n\nJust close your eyes and say:\n\nThere may be gray skies\n\nBut when it rains I can feel the sunshine\n\nI feel the sunshine\n\nAnd that which I feel\n\nI know to be real\n\nThe vision I hold when winter’s so cold\n\nI can feel the sunshine\n\nI can feel the sunshine\n\nOh and I can feel the sunshine\n\nI can feel the sunshine\n\nI can feel the sunshine",
