Glad to hear it\r\nJust one question if you can bear it\n\nDo you ever miss me, too?\n\n'Cause I spend my days still thinking of you\n\n\n\nShould I take the pill to numb the pain?\n\nChange the chemicals inside my brain\n\nI worry I won't be the same\n\nBut I guess that that's the point\n\n\n\nCan you medicate a broken heart?\n\nMake your tragedies a work of art\n\nMedicate a broken heart\n\nBuild your walls up just to rip them apart\n\nIs this the way to fix this or is this a quick fix?\n\nI really couldn't say\n\nCan you medicate, medicate, medicate it away?\n\n\n\nDoctor's smile, kill me with kindness\n\nAnd don't ask about the side effects\n\nSwallow hard, kills sadness with science\n\nBut the aftermath might make you sick\n\n\n\nShould I take the pill to numb the pain?\n\nChange the chemicals inside my brain\n\nI worry I won't be the same\n\nBut I guess that that's the point\n\n\n\nCan you medicate a broken heart?\n\nMake your tragedies a work of art\n\nMedicate a broken heart\n\nBuild your walls up just to rip them apart\n\nIs this the way to fix this or is this a quick fix?\n\nI really couldn't say\n\nCan you medicate, medicate, medicate it away?\n\n\n\nWhoa, whoa\n\nOh, medicate it away\n\nWhoa, whoa\n\nOh, medicate it away\n\n\n\nThey say give yourself a break\n\nThey told me to medicate\n\nI don't wanna medicate\n\n\n\nOh, can you medicate a broken heart?\n\nMake your tragedies a work of art\n\nMedicate a broken heart\n\nBuild your walls up just to rip them apart\n\nIs this the way to fix this or is this a quick fix?\n\nI really couldn't say\n\nCan you medicate, medicate, medicate it away?\n\n\n\nWhoa, whoa\n\nOh, medicate it away\n\nWhoa, whoa (Whoa)\n\nOh, medicate it away\n\n\n\nOh, medicate it away\n\nOh, medicate it away",
