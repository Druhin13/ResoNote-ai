  "lyrics": "A friend’s not a cheap little phony creep\r\nOr a jerk trying to make a deal\r\nA friend is a person who, most of all\r\nCares about what you feel\r\nAnd nothing is harder\r\nThan learning a friend isn't real\n\n\n\nA friend sends notes back and forth all day\n\nAnd doesn’t care that you can't spell\n\nA friend knows you’ve got a crush on your teacher\n\nBut a friend would never tell\n\nA friend's outside waiting\n\nThe minute you both hear the bell\n\n\n\nAnd if your heart is always breaking\n\n'Cause the world is just not fair\n\nWhen you’re at your worst\n\nYour friend’s the first one there\n\n\n\nGiving you something to lean on –\n\nAnd that’s what it means to be a friend\n\n\n\nA friend won't smoke when she’s in your room\n\nOr laugh at the poems you write\n\nA friend won't go and start kissing your brother\n\nThe minute that you're out of sight\n\nA friend is the person\n\nYou call sixteen times ev'ry night\n\n\n\nAnd if your heart is always breaking\n\nAnd you want to run and hide\n\nWhen your hope is gone\n\nYour friend is on your side\n\n\n\nIf someone moves in 'round the corner\n\nAnd you want to show him you care\n\nSo you give him all your last month of vacation\n\nAnd all of the time you can spare\n\nAnd then, on the first day of classes\n\nHe acts like you're not even there!\n\nThen he doesn’t know…\n\nHe doesn't know!\n\nHe’ll never know what it means to be\n\nA friend",
