  "lyrics": "Love, I was wrong and you were right again\r\nI came to find you when you ran away\r\nYou set along would be the perfect place\r\nLike paradise\r\nI asked you why and you would never speak\r\nYou made it like a game of hide and seek\n\nBut not before you took control of me\n\nIn paradise\n\n\n\nIf you gave a little, all you do is take it back again\n\nLeave me in the middle until I would reminisce again\n\n\n\nAnd I never ever thought you would leave me\n\nNever ever would you deceive me\n\nNever ever would you betray me\n\nNever ever you'll try to slay me\n\nNever ever thought you would leave me\n\nNever ever would you deceive me\n\nNever ever would you betray me\n\nNever ever you'll try to slay me\n\n\n\nYou told me lust could be an enemy\n\nString me along and [?] along my dreams\n\nLeft me alone 'til I was scared of me\n\nIn paradise\n\nI'll pack in every mirror on my walls\n\nAnd I'm not taking any of your calls\n\nSuddenly gone, and now it's all my fault\n\nIs this paradise?\n\n\n\nWhy do make every day in front of me impossible?\n\nWhy do you make anything and everything unreasonable?\n\n\n\nI never ever thought you would leave me\n\nNever ever would you deceive me\n\nNever ever would you betray me\n\nNever ever you'll try to slay me\n\nNever ever thought you would leave me\n\nNever ever would you deceive me\n\nNever ever would you betray me\n\nNever ever you'll try to slay me\n\n\n\nIf you gave a little, all you do is take it back again\n\nLeave me in the middle until I would reminisce again\n\n\n\nAnd I never ever thought you would leave me\n\nNever ever would you deceive me\n\nNever ever would you betray me\n\nNever ever you'll try to slay me\n\nNever ever thought you would leave me\n\nNever ever would you deceive me\n\nNever ever would you betray me\n\nNever ever you'll try to slay me",
