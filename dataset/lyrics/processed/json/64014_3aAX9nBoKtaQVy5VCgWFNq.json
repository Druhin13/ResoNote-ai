  "lyrics": "You fill the blanks when I get dumb\r\nYou stretch a rope when I get blind\r\nThere are often times when I tend to lose my mind\r\nBut you bring it back before it's gone\r\nAnd my cries are real cries, you know\r\nAnd my smiles ar real smiles you know\n\nAnd my lies are real lies you know\n\nOh my love is real love\n\n\n\nYou scream my name when I go deaf\n\nYou cry with me when I get drunk\n\nThere are often times when I tend to cross the line\n\nBut you watch my back no matter what\n\nAnd my fears are real fears you knox\n\nAnd my jokes are real jokes you know\n\nAnd my tears are real tears you know\n\nOh my love is real love\n\nGrow old with me",
