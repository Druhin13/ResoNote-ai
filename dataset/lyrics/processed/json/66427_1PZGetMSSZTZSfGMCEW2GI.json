  "lyrics": "There's a Judas Tree up on the hill\r\nAnd a body's hangin' there\r\nThere's a Judas Tree up on the hill\r\nYeah, a body's hangin' there\r\nNobody wants to cut it down\r\nNobody seems to care\n\n\n\nThere's silver in his pocket, baby\n\nAnd there's blood upon his hands\n\nHe put religion on a rocket\n\nMissionaries in the bad, bad lands\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nLove was in that Judas kiss\n\nBut nobody really understands\n\n\n\nLove is a curse\n\nAnd you keep reeling from the blows\n\nWhat makes it so much worse\n\nYou all think you're Juliets and Romeos\n\nThat you keep runnin' to your mistresses\n\nAnd your pretty gigolos\n\n\n\nThey say when you die hangin'\n\nYou get hard as you go down\n\nThey say when you die hangin'\n\nYou get hard as you go down\n\nI think I'll cut poor Judas loose\n\nFrom the tree\n\nAnd I'll take him underground",
