  "lyrics": "Good morning, faces out of pillow sheet\r\nI watch you dream, only time you seem at peace\r\nI've fallen into routine, we fight, fuck, then fall asleep\r\nAnd then I wake up, I think to myself, \"What a morning view\"\r\nWhen I would like to keep it, arms reach, I fall in synch with you, comfortable\r\nYeah, I said I wake up, I can't help but think, \"Ooh what a morning view\"\n\nI'd like to keep it, God said we're made to create, that's what we want to do\n\nI say \"Good morning\"\n\n\n\nWe get the sun, watch it wash all over your face\n\nStill taste you, still faded, might stay\n\nPlay hooky from work, I'd rather lay on you, what do you say?\n\nStill taste you, still faded, might stay\n\nNow that you've come back? Why did you stay out?\n\n10:30, you got a career, but you cover my money\n\nYou need a ride, it's gettin' late, you stay the night\n\nIt's 3AM, no goin' home, we break in day, you back again\n\nLet's get a taste of that morning view, all I see, all I see, all I see ooh\n\nWake up, I think to myself \"Oh, what a morning view\"\n\nI think to myself \"Oh, what a morning view\"\n\nGood, good, good morning",
