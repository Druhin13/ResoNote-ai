  "lyrics": "You're in the parking lot\r\nI'm in the car; it's locked\r\nI didn't want to let you in\r\nWhen did it get so forced?\r\nDrunk by the second course\n\nYou're never gonna let me win\n\n\n\nAnd I tried to hold my tongue\n\nBut you, you yanked it from my grip\n\nBathed it in petroleum, lit a cigarette and gave it a kiss\n\n\n\nTurn to the headlight glare\n\nCry and pretend you care\n\nI love it when we make a scene\n\n\n\nSomething to talk about\n\nRather than fucking shout\n\nMaybe we could go to sleep\n\n\n\nAnd you tried to hold your tongue\n\nBut I, I yanked it from your grip\n\nBathed it in petroleum, lit a cigarette and gave you a kiss",
