I did not ever intend to hurt anyone.\"\r\n\"How in the name of God, could you think that she wouldn't be affected?! How?! You do not have no idea how devastated we are feeling because of what you did.\"\r\nShe wonders why nobody hears her cry\n\nThe footsteps in the hallway have her terrified\n\nScared as she looks into his staring eyes\n\nHe crawls into her bed and she just lays there, almost paralyzed Feelin' powerless\n\nShe feels so powerless\n\nShe closed her eyes and hides under the covers\n\nAs her father tried to touch her\n\nHe took advantage of her, took all her innocence from her\n\nShe tried to explain to mother, but she said she don't believe it\n\nNobody wanna talk about it\n\n'Cause this don't happen to good people\n\nThis don't happen to good people\n\nAt the age of 17, she finally went to the police\n\nCharged him for the crimes he did\n\nAnd finally took him off the streets\n\nThen at the trial, she had to relive it all again\n\nUnderstand, explaining how this man took her life within\n\nAbused for 9 years, he got 4 months in the bin\n\nShe got a life-long sentence, he got slap on the wrist\n\nIt happens all too much, but too many keep it 'hush-hush'\n\nHow these kids suppose to trust us?\n\nMan, don't let em feel powerless\n\n\n\nI'm not sad I'm strong\n\nI won't feel powerless\n\nI won't feel powerless\n\nI won't feel powerless\n\n\n\nThank you to my hero, I hope to meet you some day\n\nCan anybody out there hear me? I hope somebody can hear me\n\nCause I don't wanna be here no more\n\nThank you to my hero, I hope to meet you some day\n\nCan anybody out there hear me? I hope somebody can hear me\n\nCause I don't wanna be here no more\n\n\n\nOne day, one day\n\nOne day, one day\n\n\n\nShout out where my birthplace is, and to the First Nations\n\nAnd to the people making the best out of the worst cases\n\nToo many unanswered questions and open murder cases\n\nWithout a voice how are we suppose to encourage changes?\n\nMy grandmother was part-white and part-Native\n\nIn fact, my highschool was part-white and part-Native\n\nPersonally connected, I've met people who've been affected\n\nThey've been asking for some help, but they been continually neglected\n\nHow many more of these indigenous women have to go missing Before somebody will listen? Huh?\n\nWe need to change the conditions, maybe it's blatant racism\n\nMaybe there's hate in the system, but we gotta fix it\n\nCause the people feel powerless\n\nAnd the mothers feel powerless\n\nAnd the fathers feel powerless\n\nLike, \"Don't anybody care about my daughter?\"\n\n\"Don't anybody care if she's alive or she been slaughtered?\"\n\nThey deserve to know, so they can go and bury her with honour\n\nBig up to those fightin' on, and everybody fightin' strong\n\nI wish that I could do more than just write a song\n\n\n\nI feel so powerless\n\nI feel so powerless\n\nI'm not sad I'm strong\n\nIt's hard to be strong\n\nBut don't feel powerless\n\nDon't feel powerless\n\nDon't feel powerless\n\nNo, speak up and keep on\n\n\n\nThank you to my hero\n\nI hope to meet you some day\n\nCan anybody out there hear me?\n\nI hope somebody can hear me\n\nCause I don't wanna be here no more, one day, one day\n\nOne day (One day, one day)\n\nCause I don't wanna be here no more\n\nFor some people all they have is hope (one day, one day)\n\nHopefully one day (cause I don't want to be here no more)\n\nThere's a lot of things that we don't like talking about\n\n(No more, no more)\n\nAnd we know we should be talking about it\n\n(Cause I don't wanna be here no more)\n\nThis happens a lot more than what we think it does\n\n(No more, no more)\n\nDon't let it make you feel powerless\n\n\n\nOne day, one day\n\nOne day, one day",
