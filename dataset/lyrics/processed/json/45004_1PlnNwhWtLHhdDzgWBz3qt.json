  "lyrics": "Oh! Yeah.\r\nSide by side, I'll be yours forever\r\nRain or shine, any kind of weather\r\nThere isn't anything I wouldn't do for you\r\nLet's take what's getting old and make it new\n\n\n\nOh, eye to eye, it's a blinding confrontation\n\nYou and I, we're a deadly combination\n\nSo don't start mixing truth with jealousy\n\nThe road we're on is clear as far as I can see\n\n\n\nPamela, don't break this heart of mine\n\nJust remember, it may not heal this time\n\nPamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind\n\n\n\nBlack and white always go together\n\nDay and night you're the precious juwel I treasure\n\nWanting every part of you is not a crime\n\nOr could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time\n\n\n\nPamela, don't break this heart of mine\n\nJust remember, it may not heal this time\n\nPamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind\n\n\n\n\n\nAll that I love (all that I love)\n\nThousands of miles away, but always in my heart\n\n\n\nPamela, don't break this heart of mine\n\nJust remember, it may not heal this time\n\nPamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind\n\nPamela, don't break this heart of mine\n\nJust remember, it may not heal this time\n\nPamela, there is no second chance, for the one who leaves it all behind",
