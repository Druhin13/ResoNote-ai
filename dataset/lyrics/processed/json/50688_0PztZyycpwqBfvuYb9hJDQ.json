  "lyrics": "Nobody but me to blame \nFor losing all this love \nHope is the greatest expectation \nAnd I never knew how to give up \nHand full of promises I can't hold \nOld Love letters that just might \n\nWho might have tried to break me down \n\nThey might have seen my cry \n\n\n\nI'm, I'm not foolish and I'm not blind \n\nI did what I could, \n\nI stood in the rain and I waited for love to be kind \n\nWith a heart that didn't die \n\nIt just feels a little deeper \n\nSo don't worry 'bout me, it's all that I need \n\nI'm a true believer \n\n\n\nI get up every day \n\nI think of you more than I should \n\nI won't let you disgrace the whole human race \n\nI believe people are good \n\n\n\nI, I just say it was all for the best \n\nI won't compromise and I won't close my eyes \n\nAnd pretend I can live with a list \n\nI'll just say goodbye to the way that I thought that we were \n\nI won't give up the world, cause more than anything.. \n\n\n\nI believe in love, bigger than us \n\nI believe it's the strong that I just gotta trust \n\nI give all that I have, I believe it so much \n\n\n\nI, I believe that something heavenly \n\nWith all the mistakes and the pain that love takes \n\n\n\nI still believe in what it could be \n\nThere's a Godly sound, talking to us sinners \n\nSo don't worry 'bout me, cause that's all that I need \n\nNo, don't worry 'bout me, cause that's all that I need \n\nI am a true believer \n\n\n\nNobody but me to blame, for losing all this love \n\nHope is the greatest expectation and I'll never learn how to give up",
