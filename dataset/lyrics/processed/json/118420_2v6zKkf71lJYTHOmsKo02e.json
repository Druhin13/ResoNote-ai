(Without it)\n\n\n\nNothing on you when you naked\n\nExcept a Cartier bracelet\n\nSilhouette through the shower\n\nFuck you 24 hours\n\nSun peeking through the curtains\n\nKnow I'm with you when you're hurting\n\nBaby girl, the world's ours\n\nFuck you 24 hours\n\nIn that shit like oh\n\nBaby girl, the world's ours\n\nFuck you 24 hours\n\nIn that shit like oh\n\nNothing on you when you naked\n\nExcept a Cartier bracelet\n\n\n\nNothing on you when you naked\n\nGot a pretty little heart, I don't wanna break it\n\nGirl, I just want to save you\n\nSwear to God, thank the Lord every day that he made you\n\nAll the girls tryna flex, they don't phase you\n\nTake you down with my guns, then we blaze, ooh\n\nGet rough, I'ma stay through, stay through\n\n'Cause she rare (oh, yeah)\n\nThe way she lookin' in the mirror unfair\n\nYou know we couldn't even make it upstairs\n\nHad to hit it right there\n\n\n\nNothing on you when you naked\n\nExcept a Cartier bracelet\n\nSilhouette through the shower\n\nFuck you 24 hours\n\nSun peeking through the curtains\n\nKnow I'm with you when you're hurting\n\nBaby girl, the world's ours\n\nFuck you 24 hours\n\nIn that shit like oh\n\nBaby girl, the world's ours\n\nFuck you 24 hours\n\nIn that shit like oh\n\nNothing on you when you naked\n\nExcept a Cartier bracelet, yeah, yeah",
