  "lyrics": "I feel something cruel within me\r\nCalling out\r\nIt calls my heart to wonder\r\nFar from here\r\nIt troubles my dreams\n\nThe thoughts of leaving\n\nIt claws at me\n\nLeave everything I've come to know and depend on\n\n\n\nBuried hidden meanings at the edge of everything\n\nSlowly there corroding every bit that's left of me\n\nBuried hidden meanings at the edge of everything\n\nSlowly there corroding every bit that's left of me\n\n\n\nThe weight is not mine\n\nWeight is not mine alone\n\nThough you pretend you comprehend it\n\nThe fear is not mine, the fear is not my end\n\nThough you attempt to keep me in it\n\n\n\nDid you even try to find me?\n\nDid you even care for one last chance at reconciliation?\n\nDo you know how long these veins have ran?\n\nRemnant of red that stains your hands\n\nWe are all but to our hand again\n\nThis familiar place of discontent\n\nAre you ready for the apocalypse?\n\nWhen our hearts implode, from this corrosion\n\n\n\nBuried hidden meanings at the edge of everything\n\nSlowly there corroding every bit that's left of me\n\nBuried hidden meanings at the edge of everything\n\nSlowly there corroding every bit that's left of me\n\n\n\nYou must know\n\nAnd you all, but must know\n\n\n\nThe fear is not mine, the fear is not my end\n\nThough you attempt to keep me in it\n\nThe weight is not mine\n\nWeight is not mine alone\n\nThough you attempt to keep me in it\n\n\n\nDid you even try to find me?\n\nDid you even care for one last chance at reconciliation?\n\nDo you know how long these veins have ran?\n\nRemnant of red that stains your hands",
