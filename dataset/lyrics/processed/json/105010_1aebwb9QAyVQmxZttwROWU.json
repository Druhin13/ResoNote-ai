  "lyrics": "I can't see Heaven but I think it's up there somewhere\r\nFeel closer to the Devil cause they say he lived down under\r\nBut if I could fly a thousand miles to chill with the man himself\r\nI'd probably roll up one big fat one and say thanks for creating hell\r\nBut how high do I got to get to see angels in the sky\n\nHow much smoke I gotta blow to move the clouds to see your side\n\nHow many nights I gotta pray, how many Sunday's I gotta go\n\nHow many joints, how many miles, and how high, how high do I gotta go\n\n\n\nSometimes when I'm walking I get goosebumps on my skin\n\nCause I feel like something's stalkin' and try'n to walk on my heels\n\nAnd then my spine gets some chills, when I'm strolling rivers and hills\n\nAnd hopping barbed wire fences just to come see what the deal is\n\nFuck the Devil, I'ma rob him with six rounds and a steel\n\nCut his head off, mount it on my wall by all of my deer\n\nFuck it punk, gimme that fiddle so I can leave and go pawn it\n\nHit downtown and buy some seeds and go and grow me some chronic\n\nYeah I'm always rolling stoned but now I'm trying to take flight\n\nAnd smoke a joint with old Jesus and grow some wings over night\n\nYeah watch me cut donuts in clouds past the gates made of gold\n\nYou shoulda known my soul was too priceless to ever be sold\n\n\n\nI can't see Heaven but I think it's up there somewhere\n\nFeel closer to the Devil cause they say he lived down under\n\nBut if I could fly a thousand miles to chill with the man himself\n\nI'd probably roll up one big fat one and say thanks for creating hell\n\n\n\nBut how high do I got to get to see angels in the sky\n\nHow much smoke I gotta blow to move the clouds to see your side\n\nHow many nights I gotta pray, how many Sunday's I gotta go\n\nHow many joints, how many miles, and how high, how high do I gotta go\n\nHow high do I gotta go\n\nHow high do I gotta go\n\nHow high do I gotta go\n\nHow high do I gotta go",
