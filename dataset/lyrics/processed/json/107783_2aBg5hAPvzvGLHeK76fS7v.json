  "lyrics": "Your pretending fooled us all\r\nOptimistic delusional\r\nHyperactive and so it shows\r\nIts time to measure the immeasurable\r\nOur indifference grows\n\nFrom the common evil known\n\n\n\nThe future's laid out beautiful\n\nDesigns suggesting hints to God\n\nI'd like to fathom the unfathomable\n\nAnd swear to find that certain pressure point\n\n\n\nOur indifference grows\n\nFrom the common evil known\n\nHeld down by words",
