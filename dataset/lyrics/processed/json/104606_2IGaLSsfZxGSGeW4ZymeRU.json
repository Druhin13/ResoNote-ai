  "lyrics": "My friends wonder why I call you all of the time\nWhat can I say\nI don´t feel the need to give such secrets away\nYou think maybe I need help, no, I know that I´m right\nI´m just better off not listening to friends´ advice\n\n\nWhen they insist on knowing my bliss\n\nI tell them this\n\nWhen they want to know what the reason is\n\nI only smile when I lie, then I tell them why\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list\n\n(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list\n\nBecause your kiss is on my list of the best things in life\n\n(Because your kiss) your kiss is on my list\n\n(Because your kiss) your kiss I can´t resist\n\nBecause your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light\n\n\n\nI go crazy wondering what there is to really see\n\nDid the night just take up your time, ´cause it means more tome\n\nSometimes I forget what I´m doing, I don´t forget what I want\n\nRegret what I´ve done, regret you? I couldn´t go on\n\n\n\nAnd if you insist on knowing my bliss\n\nI´ll tell you this\n\nIf you want to know what the reason is\n\nI´ll only smile when I lie, then I´ll tell you this\n\n\n\n[Chorus]",
