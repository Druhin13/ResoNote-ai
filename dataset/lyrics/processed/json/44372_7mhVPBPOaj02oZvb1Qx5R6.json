  "lyrics": "Somewhere there's a garden of everlasting love within me\r\nBut I fear that all you can see are the scars that grace my skin\r\nThese lightless walks will chafe us and just the drugs keep us warm\r\nPeople feel so lonely in the dark, I feel so lonely in the light\r\nI feel so sad about the people\n\nThat never made it behind the bars of their hometown\n\nThat never saw these bottomless depths\n\nThat never walked these mires, I have walked\n\n\n\nWorth the pain that has burned me and scarred my soul\n\nFor having been allowed to walk where I have walked\n\nWhich was to hell on earth, heaven on earth and back again\n\nUnder, far beneath, through it, in it... and above...\n\n\n\nMy dear, the concept of \"home\" is such a vague notion\n\nAs I can't stay in the same place for more than three days\n\nOnce you told me, that I'll never find home without leaving\n\nBut now I saw so many places, I at least forgot them all\n\nSo I'm lying in my bed, in my house\n\nAnd all I want to do is to go home...\n\n\n\nI had to promise them that I won't go, but nevertheless I will leave\n\nI'd like to think they must have known that I would do this one day\n\nSo I hope to arrive at my burial late, psychotic and wasted\n\n'Cause when it's about death, I feel nothing at all\n\nNothing but anticipation\n\nNothing at all\n\n\n\nAnd I will never regret all the wounds you inflicted on me\n\n'Cause another two of these scars and the world is dead\n\n\n\nFor how I harmed you my dear... I am sorry...\n\nBut as this last summer passed I could no longer bear the pain\n\nThis was our last autumn and I'll take the blame\n\nI'm so fucking sorry... but that's how it ends...",
