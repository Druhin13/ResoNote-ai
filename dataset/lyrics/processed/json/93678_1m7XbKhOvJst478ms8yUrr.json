  "lyrics": "I got a lot on my mind\r\nYou got a lot on yours\r\nBut we can run like the wind, baby\r\nGo out the door\r\nYou know we lose it sometimes in love and war\r\nBut we roll like a river\n\nWe've reached the shore\n\nSwing slowly\n\nJust hold me\n\nI just wanna spin around in circles off or on the ground (with you)\n\n\n\nWith you\n\nWith you\n\nDown and drunk and dizzy for it\n\nCome on off or on the ground\n\nI just wanna spin around in circles off or on the ground\n\n\n\nI got a lot on my mind\n\nYou got a lot on yours\n\nBut you sound like a love song, baby\n\nFall on the floor\n\nI know that sometimes we fight, sometimes ignore\n\nBut we could pull it together, see what’s in store\n\nSink slowly\n\nJust hold me\n\nI just wanna spin around in circles off or on the ground (with you)\n\n\n\nWith you\n\nWith you\n\nDown and drunk and dizzy for it\n\nCome on off or on the ground (with you)\n\nWith you\n\nWith you\n\nI just wanna spin around in circles off or on the ground\n\n\n\nIn bed with the bottle open\n\nGive me that sweet shot of lovin'\n\nNo I don't know where we’re going\n\nBut I wanna be alone with you\n\nIn bed with the bottle open\n\nGive me that sweet shot of lovin'\n\nNo I don't know where we're going\n\nBut I wanna be alone with you\n\n\n\nWith you\n\nWith you\n\nWith you\n\nDown and drunk and dizzy for it\n\nCome on off or on the ground (with you)\n\nWith you\n\nWith you\n\nI just wanna spin around in circles off or on the ground\n\n\n\nI gotta be with you\n\nI gotta be with you\n\nI gotta be with you\n\nI gotta be with you\n\nWith you",
