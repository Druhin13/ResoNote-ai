  "lyrics": "I remember when we used to sing\r\nAnd go dance outside in the pouring rain\r\nWe lived like we would never wake up\r\nFrom a dream that we shared, just the two of us\r\nBut now we're tied up, bad luck\n\nNever gonna make our minds up\n\nWorn out and restless\n\nOh, I wish that we could escape\n\n\n\nWe could escape\n\nWe could escape\n\nAnd I'd give anything to hear you tell me\n\n\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late\n\nAnd I'd give anything to hear you tell me\n\nIt's not too late\n\n\n\nAlways said that we would make the most\n\nOf what we had and keep it close\n\nSummers come and summers go\n\nThe years fly by but the days go so slow, yeah\n\n\n\nDreaming, scheming\n\nAlways believing\n\nSo right now this is my wish\n\nThat we could escape\n\n\n\nAnd I'd give anything to hear you tell me\n\n\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late\n\nAnd I'd give anything to hear you tell me\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late\n\n\n\nTen years go by and everything's changed\n\nOh, we're different people but we got the same names\n\nSo you call it out just like you did\n\nAll the time ago when we were just kids singing\n\nOh (We could escape)\n\nOh (We could escape)\n\nOh, and I'd give anything to hear you tell me\n\n\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late\n\nAnd I'd give anything to hear you tell me\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late (oh whoa)\n\nIt's not too late\n\nAnd I'd give anything to hear you tell me",
