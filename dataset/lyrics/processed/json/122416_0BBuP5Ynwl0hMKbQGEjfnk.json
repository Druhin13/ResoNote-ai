  "lyrics": "Here we are again\r\nA thick brown belt's on my arm again\r\nA table spoon full of tar again\r\nI've let go and it never felt so good\r\nI've sold out my friends\r\nAnd ruined my life over again\n\nMy energy and my money's spent\n\n\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\n'Cause I had it, then I lost it all\n\n\n\nCold sweats in the morning\n\nReal life's become boring\n\nI've tripped and I'm falling\n\nBut I'll stop tomorrow\n\nCan you catch the feeling?\n\nA small wet cloth to stem the bleeding\n\nThe scars on my arms are barely healing\n\n\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\n'Cause I had it, then I lost it all\n\n\n\n(Just a quick fix then I'll get clean)\n\n(Just a quick fix then I'll get clean)\n\n\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\n'Cause I had it, then I lost it all\n\n\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\nI can see your halo fall, halo fall\n\n'Cause I had it, then I lost it all",
