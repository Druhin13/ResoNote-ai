  "title": "If I Can Dream",
  "lyrics": "There must be lights burning brighter somewhere\r\nGot to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue\r\nIf I can dream of a better land\r\nWhere all my brothers walk hand in hand\r\nTell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true\n\nThere must be peace and understanding sometime\n\nStrong winds of promise that will blow away\n\nAll the doubt and fear\n\nIf I can dream of a warmer sun\n\nWhere hope keeps shining on everyone\n\nTell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear\n\n\n\nWe're lost in a cloud\n\nWith too much rain\n\nWe're trapped in a world\n\nThat's troubled with pain\n\nBut as long as a man\n\nHas the strength to dream\n\nHe can redeem his soul and fly\n\n\n\nDeep in my heart there's a trembling question\n\nStill I am sure that the answer gonna come somehow\n\nOut there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle\n\nAnd while I can think, while I can talk\n\nWhile I can stand, while I can walk\n\nWhile I can dream, please let my dream\n\nCome true, right now\n\nLet it come true right now\n\nOh yeah",
