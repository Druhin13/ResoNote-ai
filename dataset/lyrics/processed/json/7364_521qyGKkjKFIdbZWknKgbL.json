  "lyrics": "Stop asking musicians what they think\r\nHe said softly as he poured himself a second drink\r\nAnd outside, the world slipped over the brink\r\nWe all thought we had nothing to lose\r\nThat we could trust in crossed fingers and horseshoes\r\nThat everything would work out, no matter what we choose\n\n\n\nThe first time it was a tragedy\n\nThe second time it's a farce\n\nOutside it's 1933 so I'm hitting the bar\n\n\n\nBut I don't know what's going on anymore\n\nThe world outside is burning with a brand new light\n\nBut it isn't one that makes me feel warm\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\n\n\nIf I was of the greatest generation I'd be pissed\n\nSurveying the world that I built, slipping back into this\n\nI'd be screaming at my grand kids: \"We already did this\"\n\nBe suspicious of simple answers\n\nThat shit's for fascists and maybe teenagers\n\nYou can't fix the world if all you have is a hammer\n\n\n\nThe first time it was a tragedy\n\nThe second time it's a farce\n\nOutside it's 1933 so I'm hitting the bar\n\n\n\nBut I don't know what's going on anymore\n\nThe world outside is burning with a brand new light\n\nBut it isn't one that makes me feel warm\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\nFor the dawn\n\n\n\nAren't you ashamed of this? I surely hope that you are\n\nLiving in a society that's maybe heading for Mars\n\nBut down here we still have a shower of bastards leading the charge\n\nOutside it's 1933 so I am hitting the bar\n\n\n\nBut I don't know what's going on anymore\n\nThe world outside is burning with a brand new light\n\nBut it isn't one that makes me feel warm\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\n(Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn)\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\n(Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn)\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn\n\n(Don't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn)\n\nDon't go mistaking your house burning down for the dawn",
