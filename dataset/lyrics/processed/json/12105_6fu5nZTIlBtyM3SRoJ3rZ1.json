Fam, I back it; tool? Man'll pack it\n\nI told man I'm quarterback already, let me sack it\n\nMe, I've got this aura that these other rappers slacking\n\nYou're lipsing up a rippers, I'll snap her and blow her back in\n\n\n\nYeah, she still up in the ends, but\n\nBeing broke ain't never been on her agenda\n\nMoncler or Canada when she enter\n\nMade her join the team, now she a member\n\nYeah, she still up in the ends, but\n\nBeing broke ain't never been on her agenda\n\nMoncler or Canada when she enter\n\nMade her join the team, now she a member\n\n\n\nYeah, she still up in the ends, but\n\nBeing broke ain't never been on her agenda\n\nMoncler or Canada when she enter\n\nMade her join the team, now she a member\n\nYeah, she still up in the ends, but\n\nBeing broke ain't never been on her agenda\n\nMoncler or Canada when she enter\n\nMade her join the team, now she a member",
