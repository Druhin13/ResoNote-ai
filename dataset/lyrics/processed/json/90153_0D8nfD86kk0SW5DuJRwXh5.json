  "lyrics": "Well, I been dealing with my situation\r\nGonna hustle on down to the station\r\nHop on an old freight-liner\r\nBlow my whistle until I run out of line, line\r\nWell, I been dealing with my situation\n\nFeel I need some kind of vacation\n\nI think I'll go on down across the border\n\nDrink tequila and smoke marijuana\n\n'til I'm high, high\n\n\n\nWell, I been thinkin' 'bout the situation\n\nHow the world is full of frustration\n\nAs the president shits upon the nation\n\nWipes his ass with all denominations\n\nTurns around and begs for donations\n\nRidin' on the back of the poor man\n\nSellin' him lies, lies\n\n\n\nMaybe the loser now will always win\n\nMaybe there's still a chance for love again\n\nAfter all we've been through in the end\n\nWe're all waitin' in the same station\n\nWe're all standin' in the same situation\n\n\n\nI think I'll go and saddle up my pony\n\nRide on over to the one and only\n\nBar in town that never gets lonely\n\nSad, or blue, so you can sing to the mornin'\n\nLight, sing to the mornin' light\n\n\n\nMaybe the loser now will always win\n\nMaybe there's still a chance for love again\n\nAfter all we've been through in the end\n\nWe're all waitin' in the same station\n\nWe're all standin' in the same situation",
