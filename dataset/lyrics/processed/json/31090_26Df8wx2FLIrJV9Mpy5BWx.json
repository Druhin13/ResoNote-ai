  "lyrics": "Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends\r\nAll through their high school days\r\nBoth members of the 4H Club\r\nBoth active in the FFA\r\nAfter graduation Mary Anne went out \n\nLookin' for a bright new world\n\nWanda looked all around this town\n\nAnd all she found was Earl\n\n\n\nWell it wasn't two weeks after she got married\n\nThat Wanda started getting abused\n\nShe put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses\n\nAnd make-up to cover a bruise\n\n\n\nWell she finally got the nerve to file for divorce\n\nShe let the law take it from there\n\nBut Earl walked right through that restraining order\n\nAnd put her in intensive care\n\n\n\nRight away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta\n\nOn a red eye midnight flight\n\nShe held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan\n\nAnd it didn't take 'em long to decide\n\n\n\nThat Earl had to die\n\nGoodbye Earl\n\nThose black-eyed peas\n\nThey tasted all right to me Earl\n\nYou're feelin' weak\n\nWhy don't you lay down and sleep, Earl\n\nAin't it dark\n\nWrapped up in that tarp, Earl\n\n\n\nThe cops came by to bring Earl in\n\nThey searched the house high and low\n\nThen they tipped their hats and said,\n\n\"Thank you ladies-\n\nif you hear from him let us know\"\n\n\n\nWell the weeks went by \n\nAnd spring turned to summer\n\nAnd summer faded into fall\n\nAnd it turns out he was a missing person\n\nWho nobody missed at all\n\n\n\nSo the girls bought some land and a roadside stand\n\nOut on Highway 109\n\nThey sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam\n\nAnd they don't lose any sleep at night\n\n'Cause\n\n\n\nEarl had to die\n\nGoodbye Earl\n\nWe need a break\n\nLet's go out to the lake, Earl\n\nWe'll pack a lunch\n\nAnd stuff you in the trunk, Earl\n\nWell is that all right \n\nGood! Let's go for a ride\n\nEarl Hey",
