  "lyrics": "You're not shy, you get around\r\nYou wanna fly, don't want your feet on the ground\r\nYou stay up, you won't come down\r\nYou wanna live, you wanna move to the sound\r\nGot fire in your veins\n\nBurnin' hot but you don't feel the pain\n\nYour desire is insane\n\nYou can't stop until you do it again\n\n\n\nBut sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes\n\nMaybe you're thinking of some other guy\n\nBut I know, yes I know, how to treat you right\n\nThat's why you call me in the middle of the night\n\n\n\nYou say it's urgent\n\nSo urgent, so oh oh urgent\n\nJust wait and see\n\nHow urgent my love can be\n\nIt's urgent\n\n\n\nYou play tricks on my mind\n\nYou're everywhere but you're so hard to find\n\nYou're not warm or sentimental\n\nYou're so extreme, you can be so temperamental\n\n\n\nBut I'm not looking for a love that will last\n\nI know what I need and I need it fast\n\nYeah, there's one thing in common that we both share\n\nThat's a need for for each other anytime, anywhere\n\n\n\nIt gets so urgent\n\nSo urgent\n\nYou know it's urgent\n\nI wanna tell you it's the same for me\n\nSo oh oh urgent\n\nJust you wait and see\n\nHow urgent our love can be\n\nIt's urgent\n\n\n\nYou say it's urgent\n\nMake it fast, make it urgent\n\nDo it quick, do it urgent\n\nGotta rush, make it urgent\n\nWant it quick\n\nUrgent, urgent, emergency\n\nUrgent, urgent, emergency\n\nUrgent, urgent, emergency\n\nUrgent, urgent, emergency\n\nSo urgent, emergency\n\nEmer... emer... emer...\n\nIt's urgent",
