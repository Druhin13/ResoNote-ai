  "lyrics": "Many moons ago, in a faraway land\r\nWe met an old man with a hook for a hand\r\nHe showed us a map that lead to treasure untold\r\nHe said, \"I'll give ye the map, if ye give me some gold\"\r\nFor some pieces of eight the deal was done\n\nHe gave us the map, our quest had begun\n\nWe gathered our crew and set sail on the waves\n\nAnd we knew we'd be rich by the end of the day\n\n\n\nNow we're sailing over oceans and seas\n\nWith a lust for gold and the power of steel\n\n\n\nOver the seas, we shall ride\n\nSearching for treasure, into the night\n\nOver the seas, our quest has begun\n\nAnd we will not stop with the dawn of the sun\n\n\n\nThrough treacherous seas we reached the lost isle\n\nAnd over it's shores we marched for many miles\n\nUntil we discovered where the treasure did lie\n\nWith gold coins and jewels gleaming inside\n\n\n\nNow we're sailing over oceans and seas\n\nWith a lust for gold and the power of steel\n\n\n\nOver the seas, we shall ride\n\nSearching for treasure, into the night\n\nOver the seas, our quest has begun\n\nAnd we will not stop with the dawn of the sun\n\n\n\nOver the seas, we shall ride\n\nSearching for treasure, into the night\n\nOver the seas, our quest is done\n\n\n\nAnd we will be home by the dawn of the sun",
