  "lyrics": "Have yourself a merry little Christmas\r\nLet your heart be light\r\nFrom now on your troubles will be out of sight\r\nHave yourself a merry little Christmas\r\nMake the Yuletide gay\n\nFrom now on, all our troubles will be miles away\n\n\n\nOnce again, as in olden days\n\nMerry golden days of yore\n\nFaithful friends who are dear to us\n\nWill be near to us, once more\n\n\n\nSomeday soon we all will be together\n\nIf the fate's allow\n\nUntil then weâ€™ll have to muddle through somehow\n\nSo have yourself a merry little Christmas now",
