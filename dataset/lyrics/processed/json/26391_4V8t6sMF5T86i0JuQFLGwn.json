  "lyrics": "Beg myself to free all of the thoughts clinging to me\r\nI heard them in the crowd calling my name, mmh\r\nThey took me by the hand, showed me the line, strong in the sand\r\nHeld me, yeah held me so true, mmh\r\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've waded into the waves\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\n\n\nMemories made from gold, out of the fire, into the cold\n\nThey whispered I was right to be alone, ooh\n\n\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've waded into the waves\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\n\n\nI thought I knew, I knew your rules\n\nYou spoke of freedom and everything I'll lose\n\nI could've left you, I could've left you\n\nI could've left you somehow\n\n\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've waded into the waves\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind\n\nI could've lost my mind",
