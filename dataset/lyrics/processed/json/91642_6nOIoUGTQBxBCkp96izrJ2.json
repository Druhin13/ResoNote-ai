  "lyrics": "You whisper in my ear, dreams don't come true\r\nPoison in my mind, like a tattoo\r\nIt's inked in my head, but I can't forget\r\nWhat I had to prove\r\nOh, don't you believe anything is possible?\n\nOh, don't you believe in me and ghosts?\n\nOh, hope isn't dead, get out of my head\n\n\n\nI'll build my castle in the sky\n\nI'm floating on good light\n\nWhere dreams will never die\n\nNobody can overthrow me, I'm the king\n\nMy castle in the sky\n\nMy castle in the sky\n\nNobody can overthrow me, I'm the king\n\n\n\nWait for the light at the end of the tunnel\n\nDon't cave, searching through the dark, I tell myself, \"Have faith\"\n\nHope isn't dead, it's here in my head, never forget\n\n\n\nWatch me move mountains, I told you I'd never forget\n\nWatch me sit on the throne, as I break every rule that you said\n\n\n\nI'll build my castle in the sky\n\nI'm floating on good light\n\nWhere dreams will never die\n\nNobody can overthrow me, I'm the king\n\nMy castle in the sky\n\nMy castle in the sky\n\nNobody can overthrow me, I'm the king\n\n\n\nI'm up in the clouds\n\nTaking in my new view of the ground\n\nOh, it feels good to be king\n\nFrom my new throne I can see everything\n\nSpread my wings and fly to my castle in the sky\n\n\n\nI'll build my castle in the sky\n\nI'm floating on good light\n\nWhere dreams will never die\n\nNobody can overthrow me, I'm the king\n\nMy castle in the sky\n\nMy castle in the sky\n\nNobody can overthrow me, I'm the king",
