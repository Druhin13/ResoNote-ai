  "lyrics": "Something in the walls, something in your wall looks different\r\nSomething deep inside got me wondering why I don't understand\r\nWhy I can't put my finger on what the fuck is up, what's missing?\r\nYou distant, and I'm spinning\r\nDon't ask questions usually\n\nGot the answes that I need\n\nIntuition telling me\n\nMmm\n\n\n\nI just have a gut feeling\n\nDon't know why i don't know\n\nWhat it was, really\n\nBut the more we touch, the more it starts killing me\n\nKilling me\n\nJust have a gut feeling\n\nKilling me\n\n\n\nUh, looking in your eyes, I been feeling like I'm crazy\n\n'Cause I'm going through your phone, look for something wrong, I can't find nothing\n\nI must be tripping tryna listen to my intuition, say you guilty\n\nSo baby, just tell me, I never asked before but right now I know what's going on\n\n\n\nDon't ask questions usually, oh\n\nGot the answes that I need\n\nIntuition telling me\n\nMmm\n\n\n\nI just have a gut feeling\n\nDon't know why i don't know\n\nWhat is was, really\n\nBut the more we touch, the more it starts killing me\n\nKilling me\n\nJust have a gut feeling\n\nKilling me\n\n\n\nI'm the first to speak my mind if I feel a way\n\nNot the type to be here crying in my pillowcase\n\nIs it nothing? Or something?\n\nOoh, yeah\n\n\n\nI just have a gut feeling\n\nDon't know why i don't know\n\nWhat is was, really\n\nBut the more we touch, the more it starts killing me\n\nKilling me\n\nJust have a gut feeling, oh, oh\n\nKilling me\n\nKilling, killing me\n\n\n\nStarts killing\n\nStarts killing, oh, woah\n\nI, I, I\n\nKilling me\n\nI, I, I\n\nI, I, I, yeah\n\nI, I, I\n\nKilling, I, I, I\n\n\n\nA, aware, I was guarded while my guardian angel never parted ways. Just stayed and layed with me. Not nakedly, just waiting patiently. For now, I am aware. And as I stare into your soul, I see it clear. Can we start again from here?",
