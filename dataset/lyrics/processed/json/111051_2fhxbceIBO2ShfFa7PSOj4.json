  "lyrics": "Berry stains on a dirt road\r\nAnd sunlight on our clean clothes\r\nStare forever for all the pinches together\r\nMountains fall into the sea\r\nIf I built the frame and gave you my name\r\nWould you wander forever with me?\n\n\n\nAnd drive way up over Mt. Joy\n\nWhere everyone's free now to move how they feel now\n\n\n\nShe blames Brooklyn for hand me downs\n\nShe wakes up in her parents house\n\nAnd I got the curse of quivering youth\n\nTell the truth\n\nAll we really need's the love in this room\n\nAnd I open my lips to tell her she's the anchor, I'm a sailor\n\nWe're lost in the height of the wave\n\nEvery wave remind me why I feel this way\n\n\n\nAnd drive way up over Mt. Joy\n\nWhere everyones free now to move how they feel\n\n\n\nFeel your feet on the festival grounds\n\nThey can't stop us, feel like Ziggy Stardust\n\n'Cause they can't stop us, feel like Ziggy Stardust\n\n\n\nAnd I dreamed you felt it too\n\nAnd I dreamed it all came true\n\nAnd I dreamed you felt it too\n\nAnd I dreamed it all came true\n\nAnd I dreamed you felt it too\n\nAnd I dreamed it all came true\n\n\n\nThey can't stop us, feel like Ziggy Stardust",
