  "lyrics": "Beyond the flesh that keeps us captive there's an empty place that feeds our nothingness. the sound of your voice echoes through my veins, no more togetherness, our world laid to waste. I can see us drifting in a sea of hate. torn apart and cramped into empty space. the world keeps turning, gear in gear. lifeless and mourning, trapped in our still lifes. hearts filled with scorn, at the peak of our hollowness. we wander this torn and bleak vacuum in search for deliverance. nowhere to go and nowhere to settle. locked in these restless vessels, our realm is the emptiness. adnate with the end, lost in expiration. ghosts of yesterdays, I only worship my own decay. Connected but torn apart, we devour each other. Pragmatic and untrusting, futile in our own domain.",
