  "lyrics": "Well, I've had a wonderful career\r\nBut I think it's quite queer\r\nSo I'm writin' this down in a song\r\nI just couldn't resist\r\n'Cause it's a nice little twist\r\nAnd I think you'll agree this is just wrong\n\n\n\nI ain't never got to sing one with Willie\n\nAnd I've held it inside long enough\n\nNow I ain't too proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud\n\nI ain't never got to sing one with Willie\n\n\n\nNow I've heard him with Merle, Waylon, and Cash\n\nJones and Toby, that man is totally gracious\n\nBut I'm thinking \"Damn, why not me?\"\n\nWe could even sing it on TV\n\nJust like him and old Julio Iglesias\n\n\n\nI ain't never got to sing one with Willie\n\nAnd I've held it inside long enough\n\nNow I ain't too proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud\n\nI ain't never got to sing one with Willie\n\n\n\nWe've traveled back and forth\n\nUp and down all the highways\n\nWherever our big buses can go\n\nBut I think that it's great\n\nTo finally sing one with Strait\n\nAnd our friends will all love it, I know\n\n(But I'm lovin' it, too, Willie)\n\n\n\nI finally get to sing one with Strait\n\nWell, I think that it's been long enough\n\nI'm mighty proud, just listen to the crowd\n\nI finally got to sing one with George Strait\n\n\n\nLook at me now, I'm singing with Willie\n\nThank you, man, you just made my career\n\nWell, you shoulda said somethin', Strait\n\nI always thought we would sound great\n\nAnd I finally got to sing one with ol' George\n\n\n\nYeah, I am really proud\n\nSo I'm shoutin' it out loud\n\nI finally got to sing one\n\nWith ol' George\n\nWith ol' Willie",
