  "lyrics": "I want my money back\r\nI'm down here drowning in your fat\r\nYou got me on my knees\r\nPraying for everything you lack\r\nI ain't afraid of you\r\nI'm just a victim of your fears\n\nYou cower in your tower\n\nPraying that I'll disappear\n\nI got another plan\n\nOne that requires me to stand\n\nOn the stage or in the street\n\nDon't need no microphone or beat\n\nAnd when you hear this song\n\nIf you ain't dead sing along\n\nBang and strum to these here drums\n\nTill you get where you belong\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\nYou wanna be somebody? See somebody?\n\nTry and free somebody?\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\nHand to mouth\n\n\n\nI wrote a song for you today\n\nWhile I was sitting in my room\n\nI jumped up on my bed today\n\nAnd I played it on a broom\n\nI didn't think that it would be a song\n\nThat you would hear\n\nBut when I played it in my head\n\nI made you reappear\n\nI wrote a video for it\n\nAnd I acted out each part\n\nAnd then I took your picture out\n\nAnd taped it to my heart\n\nI've taped you to my heart, dear\n\nI've taped you to my\n\nHeart and if you pull away from me\n\nYou'll tear my life apart\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\nYou wanna be somebody? See somebody?\n\nTry and free somebody?\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\n\n\nCall the police\n\nI'm strapped to the teeth\n\nAnd liable to disregard\n\nYour every belief\n\nCall on the law\n\nI'm fixin' to draw\n\nA line between what is and seems\n\nAnd call up a brawl\n\n\n\nCall 'em right now\n\n'Cause I'm about to go pow\n\nI'm standing on the threshold\n\nOf the ups and the downs\n\nCall up a truce\n\nCause I'm about to bust loose\n\nProtect ya neck 'cause son\n\nI'm breaking out of my noose\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\nYou wanna be somebody? See somebody?\n\nTry and free somebody?\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\nHand to mouth\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nI'm living hand to mouth\n\nYou wanna be somebody? See somebody?\n\nTry and free somebody?\n\n\n\nI got a list of demands\n\nWritten on the palm of my hands\n\nI ball my fist, you're gonna\n\nKnow where I stand\n\nHand to mouth\n\nHand to mouth\n\nHand to mouth",
