  "lyrics": "\"I'm alive!\"\r\n\"I'm alive!\"\r\nFinal words of a god left drowning\r\nBurned alive\r\nBurned alive\r\nScorch the angels out from the skies\n\n\n\nBuilding up the walls to surround us in\n\nFrom a world built on sin\n\nBuilding up the strength for the release\n\nFrom a world corrupted\n\nTo be unseen\n\nWith the eyes\n\nFor it's the ground that we lie on\n\nOpen wide\n\nOpen mind\n\nNail your mouths shut it's this world\n\n\n\nWasting lives away\n\nConsume to filling\n\nOnly waking \n\nFor the feeding\n\nGive me spark to light the world\n\nUp in flames reignite \n\nA changing to better times \n\nEnd this now\n\nPillars\n\nSerpents\n\nMake it over\n\nGive me spark to light the world\n\nUp in flames reignite \n\nA changing to better times \n\nEnd this now\n\nSo no more are these dreams of angels\n\nWashed away with the tears",
