  "lyrics": "On this glorious day we're all citizens\r\nBy all your warrior's names we swear diligence\r\nLay the first stone we lay at your feet\r\nAll the world trembles, begs and flees\r\nEverybody wants one\n\nEverybody needs one\n\nEverybody heard the word, it's a sign\n\nWell, no one else can make one\n\nIf you're the one to take one\n\nBut I know that you know\n\nYou know, and (that?) I don't lie\n\n\n\nEverybody wants one\n\nEverybody needs one\n\nBut they don't grab a stone, the rocks, the box\n\nSo they can own your sword\n\nBut we don't wanna share one\n\nWe have worked too hard\n\nToo hard, alone\n\n\n\nHarder than steel is my king's will\n\n\n\nEmissaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen\n\nMy beloved citizens\n\nIt is time to ignite the mighty flame\n\nOf the royal beacon\n\nAnd then unveil the statue of our ruler\n\nWe celebrate, we built\n\nA statue of the king\n\n\n\nBigger than the last one\n\nBigger than the best one\n\nBigger than the tracks we drag to these trains\n\nThere's nothing to compare to\n\nNo one can prepare you\n\nBut I know that you know\n\nYou know, and (that?) I don't lie\n\n\n\nStronger than the last one\n\nBigger than the best one\n\nMake it from the stone and rocks and moss\n\nSo you can try to make one\n\nCause we ain't gonna show one\n\nWe all worked so hard so hard so haaard\n\n\n\nEmissaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen\n\nMy beloved citizens\n\nIt is time to ignite the mighty flame\n\nOf the royal beacon\n\nAnd then unveil the statue of our ruler\n\nWe celebrate, we've built\n\nA statue of the king\n\n\n\n\n\nHarder than steel is my king's will\n\n\n\nEmissaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen\n\nMy beloved citizens\n\nIt is time to ignite the mighty flame\n\nOf the royal beacon\n\nAnd then unveil the statue of our ruler\n\nWe celebrate, we've built\n\nA statue of the king",
