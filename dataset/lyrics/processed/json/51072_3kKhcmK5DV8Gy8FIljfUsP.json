  "lyrics": "I found a picture of your smiling face \nBringing old memories that I had locked away \nThe burden of anger from a heart filled with pain \nWas finally lifted and I smile at you again \nChorus\n\nIf time is a healer \n\nThen all hearts that break \n\nAre put back together again \n\n'Cause love heals the wound it makes \n\n\n\nI spoke such harsh words before goodbye \n\nWell I wanted to hurt you for the tears you made \n\nYou made me cry \n\nAll my hopes and dreams, well they started vanishing \n\nThose tender hurt feelings became a dangerous thing \n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nAll of the years we spent together \n\nWell they're part of my life forever \n\nI hold the joy with the pain \n\nAnd the truth is I miss you my friend \n\n\n\nChorus",
