  "lyrics": "I can’t find any way\r\nI can’t find any way to relax\r\nI can’t do anything\r\nI can’t do anything of impact\r\nI emptied out my brain\r\nIn hopes that I would have some success\n\nFinding some clarity\n\nBut I just made a mess\n\nWhat’s the point of having a voice?\n\nWhat’s the point of having a voice\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\n\n\nI’ll ramble incessantly\n\nOn pointless rattlings in my head\n\nFirst person shooter games\n\nGuitar tones, ELO arrangements\n\nThe differences in an MP3\n\nAnd a vinyl record that you can hear!\n\nBut when it means something\n\nI always disappear\n\n\n\nWhat’s the point of having a voice?\n\nWhat’s the point of having a voice\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\n\n\nAfter the contest I saw my neighbors\n\nLine up the shots and say to each other\n\n“There’s nothing left we can do right now.”\n\n\n\nAfter the tape leaked\n\nI searched for answers\n\nAccountability\n\nAll I discovered gave me\n\nFever sweats from the inside out\n\nIt made me cold from the inside out\n\nIt’s not like any other job I know\n\nIf you’re a piece of shit they don’t let you go\n\nIf you’re a piece of shit they don’t let you go\n\nIf you’re a piece of shit they don’t let you go\n\n\n\nWhat’s the point of having a voice?\n\nWhat’s the point of having a voice\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?\n\nWhen it gets stuck inside your throat?",
