  "lyrics": "Like a bird locked up in a cage called love\r\nHe cut the wings when she was born to fly\r\nHe said \"oh pretty bird, you can't sing\r\nBut I buy you diamonds and ruby rings\"\r\nLike a bird locked up in a cage\n\nAnd how can I escape in this place\n\nAnd go higher, higher?\n\nHow can I avoid the flames\n\nFrom your fire, fire?\n\nAnd oh, you can’t hold me down, no\n\nOh, you can't fool me now\n\n\n\nSo birdie fly away (higher, higher)\n\nSo birdie fly away (Higher, higher)\n\nSo birdie fly away\n\n\n\nI'm tired again and lost inside this maze, all day\n\nYour twisted words are getting to my head\n\nI say \"and no more glasses and see our stars\n\nAnd no more bruises and battle scars\"\n\nLike a bird locked up in a cage\n\n\n\nAnd how can I escape in this place\n\nAnd go higher, higher?\n\nHow can I avoid the flames\n\nFrom your fire, fire?\n\nAnd oh, you can’t hold me down, no\n\nOh, you can't fool me now\n\n\n\nSo birdie fly away (higher, higher)\n\nSo birdie fly away (Higher, higher)\n\nSo birdie fly away\n\n\n\nI ain't your prisoner\n\nYou can't lock me up no more\n\nI'll show you what I'm worth\n\nTake back what I deserve\n\nI ain't your prisoner\n\nIt can't chain me down no more\n\nGod damn, it’s gonna hurt\n\nSo fly away, little bird\n\n\n\nAnd how can I escape in this place\n\nAnd go higher, higher?\n\nHow can I avoid the flames\n\nFrom your fire, fire?\n\nAnd oh, you can’t hold me down, no\n\nOh, you can't fool me now\n\n\n\nSo birdie fly away (oh, oh, oh)\n\nCan you hear me? (oh, oh, oh)\n\nAre you listening? (oh, oh, oh)\n\nSet me free, set me free (oh, oh, oh)\n\nCan you hear me? (oh, oh, oh)\n\nAre you listening? (oh, oh, oh)\n\nSet me free, set me free",
