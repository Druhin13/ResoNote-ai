  "lyrics": "You know, the landlord rang my front door bell.\r\nI let it ring for a long, long spell.\r\nI went to the window,\r\nI peeped through the blind,\r\nAnd asked him to tell me what's on his mind.\r\nHe said,\n\n\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey, if you want to get along with me.\n\n\n\nWell, I screamed and I hollered,\n\nI was so hard-pressed.\n\nI called the woman that I loved the best.\n\nI finally got my baby about half past three,\n\nShe said I'd like to know what you want with me.\n\nI said,\n\n\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey,\n\nIf you want to get along with me.\n\n\n\nWell, I said tell me baby, what's wrong with you?\n\nFrom this day on our romance is through\n\nI said, tell me baby, face to face\n\nHow could another man take my place?\n\nShe said,\n\n\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey,\n\nIf you want to get a long with me.\n\n\n\nWell, I've learned my lesson and now I know\n\nThe sun may shine and the winds may blow.\n\nThe women may come and the women may go,\n\nBut before I say I love you so,\n\nI want\n\n\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey.\n\nMoney, honey,\n\nIf you want to get along with me.",
