  "lyrics": "I gave too much of my heart tonight\r\nCan you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?\r\nThat I can save for tomorrow's show\r\n'Cause I need somebody to remember my name\r\nAfter all that I can do for them is done\n\nI need someone to remember me\n\n\n\nI need something bigger than the sky\n\nHold it in my arms and know it's mine\n\nJust how many stars will I need to hang around me\n\nTo finally call it heaven?\n\n\n\nTo finally get somewhere I can be all done\n\nSomewhere like heaven",
