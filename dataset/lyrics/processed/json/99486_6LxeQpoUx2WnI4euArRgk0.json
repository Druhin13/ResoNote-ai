  "lyrics": "Love the taste of a cold beer after work on a Friday\r\nLove to turn it up and burn a bar down with the boys, yeah\r\nLove the sound of four wheels southbound on the highway\r\nBut there ain't nothing that I love more than\r\nThe sweet sound of your voice\n\n'Cause when it comes to loving you\n\nYeah all my walls fall down\n\nYour touch in the dark\n\nLights a fire in my heart\n\nThat can't be put out\n\nI swear the world stays still\n\nAnd the stars shine blue\n\nThe angels start singing\n\nA song I believe in\n\nWhen it comes to loving you\n\n\n\nLove the thought of watching college football with my grandad\n\nLove to hear the rain beating on the roof of an old red barn\n\nLove the way Ray Charles sings about Georgia\n\nBut there ain't nothing like Sunday mornings\n\nWhen you're lying in my arms\n\n\n\n'Cause when it comes to loving you\n\nYeah all my walls fall down\n\nYour touch in the dark\n\nLights a fire in my heart\n\nThat can't be put out\n\nI swear the world stays still\n\nAnd the stars shine blue\n\nThe angels start singing\n\nA song I believe in\n\nWhen it comes to loving you, oh\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to loving you\n\nYeah all my walls fall down\n\nYour touch in the dark\n\nLights a fire in my heart\n\nThat can't be put out\n\nI swear the world stays still\n\nYeah the stars shine blue\n\nThe angels start singing\n\nA song I believe in\n\nWhen it comes to loving you\n\nThe angels start singing\n\nA song I believe in\n\nWhen it comes to loving you",
