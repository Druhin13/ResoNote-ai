  "lyrics": "Dumbfounded, downtrodden and dejected\r\nCrestfallen, grief-stricken and exhausted\r\nTrapped in my room while the house was burnin’\r\nTo the motherfuckin’ ground\r\nI saw the sign but it was misleading\n\nI fought the law, but the law was cheating\n\nScreaming for help, but somebody keeps on\n\nTelling me to settle down\n\n\n\nPlease be honest, tell me was it you?\n\n\n\nClerk at the midwestern service station\n\nStriped uniform, giggling at catch phrases\n\nLook in her eyes we’re up to something\n\nOh, it doesn’t matter now\n\n\n\nMan in a crossover with his family\n\nSketched in decals on the window smiling\n\nDriving parallel in the lane beside me\n\nOh, it doesn’t matter now\n\nBut please be honest\n\nTell me was it you?\n\nI won’t hate you\n\nI just need to know\n\nPlease be honest\n\nTell me was it you?\n\n\n\nAt first he thought it was the undertow\n\nBut he was dragged to the bottom of the lake\n\nBy a couple of kids saying, “it’s a joke”\n\nThough he didn’t know any of their names\n\nAs they held him down, the crowd got loud\n\nAnd they cheered when they thought he had escaped\n\nWhen the anchor needed something for the 10 o’clock\n\nWhat could they say?\n\nOh what else could they say?\n\n\n\nThey said\n\n“Well, you promised us the stars\n\nAnd now we’re tired and bored.”\n\n\n\n(et tu, USA\n\nEt tu, et tu, USA)",
