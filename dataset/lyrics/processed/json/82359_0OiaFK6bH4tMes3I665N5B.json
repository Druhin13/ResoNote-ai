  "lyrics": "I set out on a narrow way many years ago\r\nHoping I would find true love along the broken road\r\nBut I got lost a time or two\r\nWiped my brow and kept pushing through\r\nI couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you\r\nEvery long lost dream led me to where you are\n\nOthers who broke my heart they were like northern stars\n\nPointing me on my way into your loving arms\n\nThis much I know is true\n\nThat God blessed the broken road\n\nThat led me straight to you\n\n\n\nI think about the years I spent just passing through\n\nI'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you\n\nBut you just smile and take my hand\n\nYou've been there you understand\n\nIt's all part of a grander plan that is coming true\n\n\n\nEvery long lost dream led me to where you are\n\nOthers who broke my heart they were like northern stars\n\nPointing me on my way into your loving arms\n\nThis much I know is true\n\nThat God blessed the broken road\n\nThat led me straight to you\n\n\n\nNow I'm just rolling home\n\nInto my lover's arms\n\nThis much I know is true\n\nThat God blessed the broken road\n\nThat led me straight to you\n\n\n\nThat God blessed the broken road\n\nThat led me straight to you",
