  "lyrics": "We're the long haulers coming down the right lane\r\nWe're the roadrunners, missing you baby\r\nWe're the day breakers, we're the night trains\r\nAnd we ain't scared of doing it the hard way\r\n'Cause our way is...\n\nRed white and blue just rolling down the blacktop\n\nBulldogs barking till the can't do backs off\n\nRaised on the road just two hands holding on steady\n\nBorn ready, born ready...\n\n\n\nWe're the headlights, we're the backbone\n\nThe highway anthem, that American road song\n\nIt goes on like...\n\n\n\nRed white and blue just rolling down the blacktop\n\nBulldogs barking till the can't do backs off\n\nRaised on the road just two hands holding on steady\n\nBorn ready, born ready...\n\nBorn ready...\n\n\n\nSitting up high with a load on\n\nMaybe lean a little harder on the throttle\n\nOn the way home\n\n\n\nRed white and blue just rolling down the blacktop\n\nBulldogs barking till the can't do backs off\n\nRaised on the road just two hands holding on steady\n\nBorn ready, born ready...\n\nBorn ready, born ready...",
