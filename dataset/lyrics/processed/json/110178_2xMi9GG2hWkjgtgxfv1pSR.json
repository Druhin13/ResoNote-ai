  "lyrics": "I still remember when I heard You call me by name\r\nI'd follow You anywhere, knew I could trust You in anything\r\nBut now sorrow beats down on me, waiting for You to come through\r\nI'm all alone with my questions, I'm dry and cracked open\r\nAnd I thirst for You\n\nAnd as I fall apart\n\nCome flood this desert heart\n\nFall like the rain, Living Water\n\nAnd I know Your way is best\n\nLord, help me find my rest\n\nAnd I'll be the clay\n\nIn the Hands of the Potter\n\n\n\nMy world is spinning, my life seems so out of control\n\nNailed scarred hands tell the story of love that will never let go of me\n\nThrough the sunshine or rain, I know where my hope is found\n\nWhat You started in me, I know You will complete from the inside out\n\n\n\nAnd as I fall apart\n\nCome flood this desert heart\n\nFall like the rain, Living Water\n\nAnd I know Your way is best\n\nLord, help me find my rest\n\nAnd I'll be the clay\n\nIn the Hands of the Potter\n\n\n\nMy world is breaking me, Your love is shaping me\n\nAnd now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me\n\nWhen my world is breaking me, Your love is shaping me\n\nAnd now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me\n\nMy world is breaking me, Your love is shaping me\n\nAnd now the enemy is afraid of what You're making me\n\n\n\nAnd as I fall apart\n\nCome flood this desert heart\n\nFall like the rain, Living Water\n\nAnd I know Your way is best\n\nLord, help me find my rest\n\nAnd I'll be the clay\n\nIn the Hands of the Potter\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be the clay\n\nIn the Hands of the Potter",
