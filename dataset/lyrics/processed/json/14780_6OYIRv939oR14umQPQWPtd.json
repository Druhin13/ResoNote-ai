  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\nI should get up and do somethin' about what I'm feelin' today\r\n10 hours later, distracted, I got what I know is in place\r\nI could be confident, bust my prerogative, blunt full of glaze\r\nTurn right around, put my prominence down like you still in the race\r\nYou gotta do more to be more that you ever forgave\n\nPardon but what is the limit?\n\nAnxiety trippin', I'll never be finished, nah\n\n\n\nHead games, ooh\n\nHead games, ooh\n\nHead games, ooh\n\nHead games, I\n\n\n\nThink I need more than I already have\n\nStill a perfectionist, reekin' of evidence\n\n[?]\n\nGave us mistakes\n\nI fixate on my flaws, so my [?]\n\n[?]\n\nI pull up like, \"What's poppin',\" fuck what you've done\n\nTotal disregard how far you would come\n\nAll I see is empty space on this road\n\nCome and tell it, you got so far to go\n\nThat's those...\n\n\n\nHead games, ooh\n\nHead games, ooh\n\nHead games, ooh\n\nHead games\n\n\n\nFamily secure\n\nFinancial freedom, the better treaty\n\nGolden castles right beside me, Nefertiti\n\nYou're stability, I pray you never leave me\n\nHad to work the overnight slave graveyard\n\nHope for three wishes and a genie\n\nWas Aladdin way before Aladdin had it clappin'\n\nThat's [?] Princess Jasmine\n\nStealin' watermelon, dodging swords\n\nYoung broke boy connoisseur\n\nAll my niggas fallin' back to prison\n\nFrom grabbin' smithens, automatics [?]\n\nWhat you waitin' for?\n\nYou got the power to, hold up\n\nYou got the power to turn all these visions\n\nTo [?] reality, love is a sacrifice\n\nBring up the calvary, know the land\n\nThat shit'll only delay your blessings, hold up\n\nSwitch it up, know you love somethin' when you give it up\n\nKnow you above it when you don't give a fuck\n\nNever had a posse or party\n\nCould hardly remember the times when it was 10 of us\n\nLook what you've accomplished here\n\nLook who's in the light and the dark's been clear\n\nNo fog, nigga, the dark gets clear\n\nWhy do I question my blessings? Why?\n\nWhy do I not take my own suggestions?\n\nRun circles and chase false perfection\n\nMurder with the money, cars\n\n[?] I was taught to follow God\n\nMade it out from jungles, world's problem solved\n\nSo take off your top like it's Mardi Gras\n\nWhat's all the fussin'? Your favorite rapper\n\nYour favorite artist, all this conversation\n\nWho you call an artist? What is competition?\n\nDon't know how to listen\n\nHow we go from [?] to algorithms?\n\nDon't confuse my opposition nor my hunger\n\n[?] thunder\n\nNiggas love yellin' \"I'm the best\"\n\nInsecure, insecure, you're more [?] than a [?]\n\nScripture [?] everybody's [?] lazy\n\nI support it, all you niggas look like Lawrence\n\nI've been doin' this since [?] clout goggles\n\nWay before you walked in\n\nMan I've never had an off day\n\nA million in cash, spend it on my off day\n\nWho am I to give a damn about what any [?] say?\n\nWhat about what God say?\n\nTold my niggas all we gotta do is...\n\n\n\n\n\nGet out of your own mind\n\n\n\nNow this remind me of the [?] circuit\n\nLittle brother, picture perfect\n\nA simpler time in this life of mine\n\nMy freedom of expressions taught me lessons\n\nMy father couldn't find time to present\n\nAnd times I often resent\n\nOf thus and wrong in my life\n\nAt 21, I repent\n\nHoly water [?] facials\n\nArise to ascent\n\nThe smell of praises and \"Jesus loves you\"\n\nNo pain in my eyes\n\nA couple of months, my consistency took a dip, no surprise\n\nSee this is all a disguise\n\nMy human nature favored sinnin', floodin' in your life\n\nLove lust, what's trust? I put my all into the mic\n\nUp on some 1995 shit, hip-hop purist\n\nI hated Lil Jon and Lil Wayne\n\n[?] Nas lyrics in\n\n[?] scriptures in\n\nSouthern Florida boy, the Trick Daddy's thug holiday\n\nIt was written in muddy waters\n\nCreate a sanctuary and he starts\n\n[?] apologies I bombarded with my mama's issues\n\nSee our relationship led to love that was hard to get through\n\nMy safest place became prison, developed richer religion\n\nA set of beliefs that incited grief, many nights with tissues\n\nAnd Uncle G I miss you\n\nBut our relationship suffered from our positions as individuals, see\n\nI became a man, you couldn't understand\n\nAnd saw me as the same little nigga you met at 16\n\nI miss things, miss when I didn't judge who I was on a daily basis\n\nPressin' my inner patience, runnin' my mind in circles and losin' my inner sanctum\n\nI'm still distracted by others' journeys and lookin' backwards\n\nWhy do I lose my passion when [?] got a plan of savin' for me\n\nSince [?] and Michael [?]\n\nWho was the financial backing in power, it's time for action\n\nQuit with these head games, I'm tryna make somethin' happen",
