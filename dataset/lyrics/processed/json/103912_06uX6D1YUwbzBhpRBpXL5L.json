Brokenhearted? Or only friends?\"\n\nYou're not gonna like the story if you know how it ends\n\nWonder if we'll be kissing out on all the time that we spent\n\nWell, you're not gonna like the story\n\nIf you know how, you know how it ends\n\nIf you know how it ends\n\nYeah, if you know how it ends\n\n\n\nHow we gonna build suspense if you already hear the bells ring?\n\nWants to just be sure before we've even started\n\n\n\nHonestly, I hadn't thought, hadn't thought about it yet (Oh, oh)\n\nAre you sure you wanna skip that far, wanna skip that far ahead?\n\nThat's when he said\n\n\n\n\"Will we be together forever?

Brokenhearted? Or only friends?\"\n\nWell, you're not gonna like the story if you know how it ends\n\nWonder if we'll be kissing out on all the time that we spent\n\nWell, you're not gonna like the story\n\nIf you know how, you know how it ends\n\nIf you know how it ends\n\nYeah, if you know how it ends\n\nIf you know how it ends\n\nYeah, if you know how it ends",
