  "lyrics": "You call in the middle of the night\r\nYou're all like I’m standing right here outside\r\nAnd I let you in, we come together like a car crash\r\nHow'd it all happen so fast then you're gone\r\nFeels so right, I feel so wrong\n\nI’d rather have a girl that wrecks me rather than feel nothing at all\n\nDon't know if you love me\n\nOr you're obsessed with pushing my heart up against the wall\n\nIf this is just a game to you, baby, you can just play me\n\nHere I am, girl, take me\n\n'Cause I'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nI'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nThan that same love, that same fluff\n\nCan't help but let you drive me insane, love\n\n'Cause I’d rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nI’d rather have a girl\n\n\n\nRelax, me hanging by a thread\n\nI know it might end up killing me in the end\n\nI don't know why I try and fight it\n\n’Cause we both know I kinda like it this way\n\nEven if you only like the chase\n\n\n\nI'd rather have a girl that wrecks me rather than feel nothing at all\n\nDon't know if you love me\n\nOr you're obsessed with pushing my heart up against the wall\n\nIf this is just a game to you, baby, you can just play me\n\nHere I am, girl, take me\n\n’Cause I'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nI'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nThan that same love, that same fluff\n\nCan't help but let you drive me insane, love\n\n'Cause I'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nI'd rather have a girl\n\n\n\nYou know exactly every button, you let every taste linger\n\nYou got me all up in my head, you got me wrapped around your finger\n\n\n\nI'd rather have a girl that wrecks me rather than feel nothing at all\n\nDon't know if you love me\n\nOr you're obsessed with pushing my heart up against the wall\n\nIf this is just a game to you, baby, you can just play me\n\nHere I am, girl, take me\n\n'Cause I'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nI'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nThan that same love, that same fluff\n\nCan't help but let you drive me insane, love\n\n'Cause I'd rather have a girl that wrecks me\n\nI'd rather have a girl",
