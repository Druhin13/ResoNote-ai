  "lyrics": "Merrily we fall out of line \nOut of line \nI'd fall anywhere with you \nI'm by your side \nSwinging in the rain \nHumming melodies \n\nWe're not going anywhere until we freeze. \n\nI'm not afraid anymore \n\nI'm not afraid. \n\nForever is a long time. \n\nBut I wouldn't mind spending it by your side. \n\nCarefully we'll place for our destiny \n\nYou came and you took this heart \n\nAnd set it free. \n\nEvery word you write and sing is so warm to me. \n\nSo warm to me. \n\nI'm torn, I'm torn \n\nTo be right where you are. \n\nI'm not afraid anymore. \n\nI'm not afraid. \n\nForever is a long time. \n\nBut I wouldn't mind spending it by your side. \n\nTell me everyday \n\nI get to wake up to that smile. \n\nI wouldn't mind it at all. \n\nI wouldn't mind it at all. \n\nYou so know me. \n\nPinch me gently. \n\nI can hardly breath. \n\nForever is a long, long time. \n\nBut I wouldn't mind spending it by your side. \n\nTell me \n\nEveryday I get to wake up to that smile. \n\nI wouldn't mind it at all. \n\nI wouldn't mind it at all\n\n\n\n(Grazie a Moni per questo testo)",
