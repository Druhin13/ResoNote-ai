  "lyrics": "If you're thinking that my life\r\nIs a hoot and a holler\r\nFrom the start of the day\r\nTo the dark of the night\r\nAnd that its ringin' like a bell\r\nThat you only want to follow\n\nGotta trust me when I say\n\nI'm just trying to get it right\n\n\n\nStill I think about myself\n\nAs a lucky old dreamer\n\nIf you're askin' me to tell\n\nIs it worth what I paid\n\nYou gonna hear me say\n\n\n\nHell yeah it is\n\nAnd I say it loud\n\nI loved it all\n\nAnd I'm not too proud\n\nI freed my soul...just let it fly\n\nHell yeah this crazy life around me\n\nIt confuses and confounds me\n\nBut it's all the life I've got until I die\n\nHell yeah it is\n\n\n\nIf you're asking for my time\n\nIsn't much left to give you\n\nBeen around a good long while\n\nSo I gotta say it fast\n\nTime is all we'll ever need\n\nBut it's gotta have a meaning\n\nYou be careful how it's spent\n\nCause it isn't going to last\n\n\n\nI hear you wondering out loud\n\nAre you ever gonna make it?\n\nWill you ever work it out?\n\nWill you ever take a chance\n\nAnd just believe you can?\n\n\n\nHell yeah you will\n\nYou're gonna be okay\n\nAnd you might get lost\n\nBut then you'll find a way\n\nDon't go alone\n\nCan't be afraid\n\nHell yeah\n\nThis life is here and it's made for livin'\n\nAnd love's a gift that's made for givin'\n\nYou give it all away and have it still\n\nAnd Hell yeah you will\n\n\n\nI've been living in a bowl\n\nWith a lot of people staring\n\nWith my feet on shaky ground\n\nAnd my head up in the sky\n\nBut it's where I want to be\n\nIt's a life that's made for caring\n\nGot a song to pass the day\n\nAnd a girl to share the night\n\n\n\nSo if they ask you when I'm gone\n\nWas it everything he wanted?\n\nWhen he had to travel on\n\nDid he know he'd be missed?\n\nYou can tell them this\n\n\n\nHell yeah he did!\n\nHe saw it all\n\nHe walked the line\n\nNever had to crawl\n\nHe cried a bit\n\nBut not for long\n\nHell yeah\n\nHe found the life that he was after\n\nFilled it up with love and laughter\n\nFinally got it right\n\nAnd made it fit\n\nHell yeah he did!\n\nHell yeah he did!\n\nHell yeah he did!",
