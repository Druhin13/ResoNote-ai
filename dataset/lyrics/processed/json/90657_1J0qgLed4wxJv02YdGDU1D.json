  "lyrics": "Well my daddy said the day he met you\r\nWe weren't meant to be\r\nSaid \"That boy’s got a wild streak in him\"\r\nThat spelled trouble for me\r\nMy foolish heart had love to burn\r\nYou took it for a ride\n\nDown a long road of twists and turns\n\nHeartaches, hurt, and lies\n\n\n\nYou put the T for tears in Texas\n\nS for sad in St. Louis\n\nOur reckless travels led us\n\nTo the state of Missouri/misery\n\nI cried clear 'cross Carolina\n\n'Bout some boy in Tennessee\n\nThere’s no U in Oklahoma\n\nAnd that's okay with me\n\n\n\nWe tried K.C., Fort Worth, Reno\n\nCheyenne, Timbuktu\n\nSomewhere down 'round Tupelo\n\nMy daddy's words rang true\n\nI called it quits in T-Town\n\nI finally had my say\n\nAdiós, see you around\n\nI'm gone, you go your way\n\n\n\nYou put the T for tears in Texas\n\nS for sad in St. Louis\n\nOur reckless travels led us\n\nTo the state of Missouri/misery\n\nI cried clear 'cross Carolina\n\n'Bout some boy in Tennessee\n\nThere's no U in Oklahoma\n\nAnd that’s okay with me\n\nYou put the T for tears in Texas\n\nS for sad in St. Louis\n\nOur reckless travels led us\n\nTo the state of Missouri/misery\n\nI cried clear ’cross Carolina\n\n'Bout some boy in Tennessee\n\nThere’s no U in Oklahoma\n\nAnd that's okay with me\n\nThere's no U in Oklahoma\n\nAnd that's okay with me",
