  "lyrics": "It seems to me you shut out\r\nanything that might confuse\r\nthe warped and twisted visions\r\nof the narrow little paths you choose\r\nwe're all potential converts in your eyes\r\nI think instead you need to take one step beyond\n\ncause right now you're just standing on my head\n\nI swore a million times I'd never play this game with you\n\nso don't act all offended when I tell you what I think of you\n\nyou mouth the party line you learned from all your newfound friends\n\nyou tell me that you're feet are on the ground but now you're standing on my head\n\nanother gang of whitebred privelaged kids is all I see\n\nI wonder if you really think that all your rules spell anarchy\n\nreact and call it revolution you're stuck in the first step\n\nso don't pretend to be my friend\n\nwhen all you're doing is standing on my head",
