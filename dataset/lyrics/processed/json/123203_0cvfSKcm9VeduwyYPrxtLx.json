  "lyrics": "I hoped, you'd stay, just a little bit longer\r\nAnd I hoped you'd keep calling\r\nWith every single day I have to face\r\nI wonder why our love was stolen away\r\nWith every single breath I have to waste\n\n\n\nI'm burning like a fire, will someone help my pain?\n\nI'm drowning above the water, oh, help me breathe again\n\nAnd I, I can't let you go, so when you're ready, come back home\n\n\n\nI'd like to say, I'm sorry\n\nAnd I thought you'd stay (you'd stay)\n\n\n\nWith every single night I'd have to face\n\nWith every single dream I'd have to chase\n\nI wonder if our love's in the same place\n\n\n\nI'm burning like a fire, will someone help my pain?\n\nI'm drowning above the water, oh, help me breathe again\n\nAnd I, I can't let you go, so when you're ready, come back home, yeah\n\n\n\nI would try and be the man that I said I would\n\nJust come back home\n\nAnd I'll try, I'll try cause I said I would\n\nJust come back home\n\nI will try and be the man that I said I would\n\nJust come back home\n\nAnd I'll try, and I'll try, and I'll try\n\nCome back home, please come back home\n\n\n\nI'm burning like a fire, will someone help my pain?\n\nI'm drowning above the water, oh, help me breathe again\n\nAnd I, I can't let you go, so when you're ready, come back home",
