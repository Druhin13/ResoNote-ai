  "lyrics": "You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind\r\nInstead of slamming down the phone girl, for the hundredth time\r\nI got your number on my wall, but I ain't gonna make that call\r\nWhen divided we stand baby, united we fall\r\nGot the time got a chance gonna make it\n\nGot my hands on your heart gonna take it\n\nAll I know I can't fight this flame\n\nYou could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind\n\nCause I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time\n\n\n\nWithout you\n\nOne night alone Is like a year without you baby\n\nDo you have a heart of stone\n\nWithout you\n\nCan't stop the hurt inside\n\nWhen love and hate collide\n\n\n\nI don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for\n\nWhen we treat each other baby, like an act of war\n\nI could tell a million lies and it would come as no surprise\n\nWhen the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes\n\n\n\nThere's a time and a place and a reason\n\nAnd I know I got a love to believe in\n\nAll I know got to win this time\n\n\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\n[SOLO]\n\n\n\nYou could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind\n\nCause I'm crazy 'bout you baby...Crazy...Crazy\n\n\n\nWithout you\n\nOne night alone\n\nIs like a year without you baby\n\nDo you have a heart of stone\n\nWithout you\n\nOne night alone\n\nIs like a year without you baby\n\nIf you have a heart at all\n\nWithout you\n\nCan't stop the hurt inside\n\nWhen love and hate collide",
