  "lyrics": "I guess I'm just changing with the wind\r\nTurning in a different direction again and again and again\r\nNo, I'm sorry, I don't have to spell it out for you, my friend\r\n'Cause I just got a few things I gotta get off my chest\r\nI know it's hard to digest\r\nWhy don't you come inside and pull up a chair?\n\nTurn the music up loud and sit over there\n\nDon't you see I got myself into a bit of a pickle over here?\n\nWhy don't you invite the devil inside\n\nTo dance around my living room?\n\nOnly got a table for two\n\nI put my face inside my hands\n\n'Cause I fucking hate the things you do\n\n\n\nI said the road is long\n\nKeep carrying on\n\nI don't need your loving for my salvation\n\nI found myself between the dirt and desperation\n\nI don't need you for my own validation\n\nI said the road is long\n\nKeep carrying on\n\nI don't need your loving for my salvation\n\nI found myself between the dirt and desperation\n\nI don't need you for my own validation\n\n\n\nOh oh oh, yeah\n\nOh oh oh, yeah\n\n\n\nPicture a perfect memory\n\nI put it in your pocket\n\nOh no, I guess you forgot it\n\nCut your hair it all feels the same\n\nBurning the clothes you wear\n\nIt doesn't change the game\n\nStaring deep into the dancing flame\n\nLet the fire fuel your soul, it doesn't hide the shame\n\nAnd oh the things that I would do\n\nTo give away the pain\n\n'Cause everytime I call I'm getting to the message tone\n\nAnd I've been sitting here waiting by the telephone\n\nCalculating reason in my mind\n\nAll night long\n\nI guess it goes on and on\n\nAnd I thought that you might get the picture that\n\nIâ€™m moving forward with my life\n\nWhen I left nothing for you to get by\n\n\n\nI said the road is long\n\nKeep carrying on\n\nI don't need your loving for my salvation\n\nI found myself between the dirt and desperation\n\nI don't need you for my own validation\n\nI said the road is long\n\nKeep carrying on\n\nI don't need your loving for my salvation\n\nI found myself between the dirt and desperation\n\nI don't need you for my own validation\n\n\n\nOh oh oh, yeah\n\nOh oh oh, yeah\n\n\n\nI said the road is long\n\nKeep carrying on\n\nI don't need your loving for my salvation\n\nI found myself between the dirt and desperation\n\nI don't need you for my own validation\n\nI said the road is long\n\nKeep carrying on\n\nI don't need your loving for my salvation\n\nI found myself between the dirt and desperation\n\nI don't need you for my own validation",
