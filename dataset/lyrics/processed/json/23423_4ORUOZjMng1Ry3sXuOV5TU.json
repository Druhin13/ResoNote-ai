  "lyrics": "I see a change is coming to our lives\rIt's not the same as it used to be\rAnd it's not too late to realise our mistake\rWe're just not right for each other\rLove has slipped away left us only friends\rWe almost seem like strangers\rAll that's left between us are the memories we shared\rOf times we thought we cared for each other\rThere's nothing left to do but go our separate ways\rAnd pick up all the pieces left behind us\rAnd maybe someday, somewhere along the way\rAnother love will find us\rSome day when she's older, maybe she will understand\rWhy her mom and dad are not together\rThe tears that she will cry when I have to say goodbye\rWill tear at my heart forever\rThere's nothing left to do but go our separate ways\rAnd pick up all the pieces left behind us\rAnd maybe someday, somewhere along the way\rAnother love will find us",
