  "lyrics": "Woke up this morning\r\nPut on my slippers\r\nWalked in the kitchen and died\r\nAnd oh what a feeling!\r\nWhen my soul\r\nWent thru the ceiling\n\nAnd on up into heaven I did ride\n\nWhen I got there they did say\n\nJohn, it happened this way\n\nYou slipped upon the floor\n\nAnd hit your head\n\nAnd all the angels say\n\nJust before you passed away\n\nThese were the very last words\n\nThat you said:\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nPlease don't bury me\n\nDown in that cold cold ground\n\nNo, I'd druther have \"em\" cut me up\n\nAnd pass me all around\n\nThrow my brain in a hurricane\n\nAnd the blind can have my eyes\n\nAnd the deaf can take both of my ears\n\nIf they don't mind the size\n\nGive my stomach to Milwaukee\n\nIf they run out of beer\n\nPut my socks in a cedar box\n\nJust get \"em\" out of here\n\nVenus de Milo can have my arms\n\nLook out! I've got your nose\n\nSell my heart to the junkman\n\nAnd give my love to Rose\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\n\n\nGive my feet to the footloose\n\nCareless, fancy free\n\nGive my knees to the needy\n\nDon't pull that stuff on me\n\nHand me down my walking cane\n\nIt's a sin to tell a lie\n\nSend my mouth way down south\n\nAnd kiss my ass goodbye\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus",
