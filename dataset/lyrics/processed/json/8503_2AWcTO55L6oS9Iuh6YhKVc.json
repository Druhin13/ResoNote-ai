  "lyrics": "In air so hot and sweet\r\nWe heard it in the breeze\r\nMetallic shimmering \nOf invisible things\r\nWill we ever have our own house?\n\nWill we ever be in one place long?\n\nLong enough to know all the sounds\n\nTo at least know our way around?\n\n\n\nWhen you said that you'd love me better\n\nWith every passing day\n\nHow could that go on forever\n\nWhen I'm different everyday\n\n\n\nIn air so hot and sweet \n\nWe heard it in the breeze\n\nMetallic simmering \n\nOf invisible things",
