  "lyrics": "Turn out the lights\r\nFeed the fire till my soul breaks free\r\nMy heart is high as the waves above me\r\nDon't need to understand\r\nToo lost to lose\r\nDon't fight my tears cause they feel so good\n\n\n\nAnd I\n\nI will remember how to fly\n\nUnlock the heavens in my mind\n\nFollow my love back through the same secret door\n\n\n\nLook past the end\n\nIt's a dream, as it's always been\n\nAll life lives on if we've ever loved it\n\n\n\nAnd I\n\nI will remember how to fly\n\nUnlock the heavens in my mind\n\nFollow my love back through the same secret door",
