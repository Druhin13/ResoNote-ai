  "lyrics": "I don't know the way back to the place where our love lies\r\nBlindfolded, it feels, and we're trying to see out to the sunlight\r\nI used to love with my eyes closed\r\nBut now it seems that we just keep\n\nSo we just keep dancing around every day\n\nAnd we just keep playing the same guessing games\n\nAnd we both know we'll never go back to the start\n\nIf we just keep throwing darts in the dark\n\n\n\nDarts in the dark\n\nI don't know the way\n\nBack to your heart\n\nI don't know the way\n\nDarts in the dark\n\n\n\nI remember you would just keep dancing, too\n\nFind your love 'cause lately, darling, darkness is the moon between us\n\n\n\nI used to love with my eyes closed\n\nBut now it seems that we just keep\n\n\n\nSo we just keep dancing around every day\n\nAnd we just keep playing the same guessing games\n\nAnd we both know we'll never go back to the start\n\nIf we just keep throwing darts in the dark\n\n\n\nDarts in the dark\n\nI don't know the way\n\nBack to your heart\n\nI don't know the way\n\nDarts in the dark\n\n\n\nThrowing darts in the dark, somebody's gonna get hurt\n\nThrowing darts in the dark, only gonna make things worse\n\nI will never find the center of your heart\n\nIf I keep throwing darts in the dark, throwing darts in the dark\n\n\n\n[?]\n\nDarts in the dark\n\nI will never find the center of your heart\n\nIf we don't stop, if we don't stop shooting darts in the dark\n\nI will never find the center of your heart\n\nI will never find the center of your heart",
