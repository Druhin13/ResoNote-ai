  "lyrics": "Oh I was naive\r\nMy shoes were untied\r\nIn heaven everything is just fine\r\nBut the phones are dead\r\nAnd so is the light\r\nAnd so are you\n\nAnd honey so am I\n\nBut the earth still turns\n\nFor the unconcerned\n\nDays pass below like train windows\n\nI was a sapling tree\n\nThe birds looked like me\n\nSo I begged my nerves to kick me something new\n\nFrom time to time\n\nI'd watch you sleep\n\nI wonder how much freedom we can dream\n\nAnd I'm sorry when you wake up to me\n\nI just got tired\n\nShining steady like a spider web\n\nIs an empty stage\n\nNow people say\n\nWhat drugs did you take\n\nAnd why don't you start taking them again?\n\nBut they're not my friends\n\nAnd if I was dead\n\nWhat difference would it ever make to them\n\nIf I got high\n\nFrom time to time\n\nI wonder how much freedom you would need\n\nAnd I'd be sorry when you wake to me\n\nI'm reaching out to you\n\nI'm writing all the time\n\nI don't see deep but I see far and wide\n\nI see dead trees\n\nBut the roots have leaves\n\nJust because I can't describe it doesn't mean I shouldn't try\n\nTo untwist the knife\n\nTo unmake my mind\n\nHaving been is no way to be alive\n\nAnd I'm alive\n\nWhen I watch you sleep\n\nI wonder how much freedom we need\n\nAnd I'm here\n\nWhen you wake up to me\n\nI'm still here\n\nWhen you wake up to me",
