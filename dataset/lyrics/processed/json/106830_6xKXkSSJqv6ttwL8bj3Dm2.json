  "lyrics": "I got so much time today\r\nI got hopes and dreams and plans all yet to be made\r\nSo get out the way\r\n'Cos I'm coming through now\r\nI got something to do\r\nAnd I'll try\n\nAs I might\n\nTo keep up with the light\n\n'Til I'm into bed for the night\n\n\n\nI got so much more to say\n\nI got books and tapes and canvas bearing the weight\n\nBut they're not arranged\n\n'Cos it takes too long and\n\nI'm still moving on\n\nBut I don't\n\nEven know\n\nWhere I should be trying to go\n\nSo I guess I'll follow my nose\n\n\n\nAnd I can't help but think about\n\nIf the sun ever stays down\n\nWill I notice or will I\n\nJust be sitting around\n\nTicking a list off\n\nRueing what I said wrong\n\nBut dawn still greets my windowpanes\n\nAnd as long as I shall\n\nWake up in the morning\n\nI got plans\n\n\n\nI got so much time today\n\nI got so much time today\n\nI got so much time today\n\nI got so much time",
