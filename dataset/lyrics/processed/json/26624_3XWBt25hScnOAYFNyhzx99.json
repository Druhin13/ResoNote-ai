  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson England Is Unwell par L.A. Salami\r\nBeyond the Queen, beyond her majesty\nAnd the majestic lean that her princes seem to see\nThere lies at her feet a Shakespearean tragedy\n'Cause in her country lies a million mimes and a million years of time\n\nSo when Kayla comes a-fleeing from the warring Israel\nBecomes an immigrant in a council flat in northern Camberwell\nAnd well it's overwhelmin' that she's on the land where Chaucer dwelled\nFinds a job as a waitress and is quite comfy for a spell\nThen when she's more apt with English wishes tend to swell\n\nAnd her ambitions stretch beyond the point [?]\nAnd due to here complexion some will there decide that she\nIs an intruder, a bloodsucker of the soul of their country\n\nThey all go for hell\nSo they egg her door to make her life hell as well\nShe has grown to know it well\nAnd she can tell that England is unwell\n\nThey are so frustrated 'cause England means equality for all\nBut they're a walking contradiction 'cause you aren't so equal when you're poor\n\nNow Shagrinda came illegally but that's beside the point\n\nHe was sure that he'd be clean of sin once he had been anointed\nBy the sun and the rain of England\nAnd he'd be able to sustain in England\nAnd maybe he would gain in England\nBut he was soon to see the pain in England\nHe saw a woman beaten up by roadmen in dark tops\nAnd high on English chivalry he gave chase and [?] stop\nBut when he did catch up with them they stabbed him and he dropped\n\nHe never rose again, but a country swelled\nWhere a hero rose and fell\nHe'd grown to know it well\nAnd he could tell that England was unwell\n\nThey are so frustrated 'cause England means honor and generosity\n\nBut they're a walking contradiction 'cause they're full of so much hostility\n\nCome, come along by an English song, sarcasms of the press\nForget is all, 'cause naturally her part, it won't suffice\nI know it well and I know it true, I've lived here all my life\nSomething in the air I feel just doesn't sit quite right\nShould I voice my worries, I'm a conscientious lad\n\nMaybe I shouldn't, hell, praytell\nWell England is unwell\nI've grown to know it well\nAnd I can tell that England is unwell",
