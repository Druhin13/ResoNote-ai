  "lyrics": "Let down and fallen out to be\r\nCoked up and gone fleeing south\r\nYou're disengaged\r\nWhile she stays home\r\nTo pick up your tabs\r\nCause your just horny\n\nWith secret texts\n\nFrom other names\n\nIn your old phone\n\nBy the picture frames\n\nAnd you think I must not remember\n\nYou think I must not remember\n\nBut I do\n\n\n\nHere lies the magician\n\nSurvived by applause but still can't listen\n\nThe Bastardizer\n\nThe patron saint\n\nOf disconnection\n\nOf feel-no-shame\n\nYou leave a son\n\nWho has your name\n\nWhen you're finally gone\n\nHe'll be okay\n\n\n\nYou think I must not remember\n\nYou think I must not remember\n\nBut I do\n\nYou think I must not remember\n\n\n\n(I must not remember)\n\nRunaway father\n\nYou swear him away\n\nNow that you're absent\n\nYou find it okay\n\nNext generation\n\nIt's feeling the same\n\nRaising themselves up but can't forget your name",
