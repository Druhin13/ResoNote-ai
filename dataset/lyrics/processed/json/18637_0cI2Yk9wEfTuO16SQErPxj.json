  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Manila par Pianos Become The Teeth\r\nAnd all that I see are\nThe either or's and I'm still yours\nAnd I'm slipping out the way I choose\nLike soft, slight Sunday blues\n\nAnd all that I taste now\nFaint Manila, so familiar\n\nFlying gulls raging in the wind\nRace the ships, wings guided by the waves\nPressure at bay, tension's here to stay\nThe gulf coast way\n\nAnd all that I take now is my time\nYou're so graceful, holding but losing us\nIt's great how you're so selfless with our shared life\n\n\nYou're untouchable, stunning\nAnd I'm drowning in this sea\n\nYour love all the time\nIt's ours if you say so\nJust want something more\nTo take a hold of\n\nWhen everything turns out differently\nI'll keep promising and listening to the loons\n\nAll that I take now is my time\nYou're so patient, holding but losing us\nIt's great how I'm so selfish with our shared life\n\nAnd all that I taste now\n\nFaint Manila, so familiar\nI'm yours",
