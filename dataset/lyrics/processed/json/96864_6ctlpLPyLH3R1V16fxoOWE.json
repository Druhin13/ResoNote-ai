  "lyrics": "I'd be the voice that waged Orpheus\r\nWhen her body was found\r\nI'd be the choiceless hope in grief\r\nThat drove him underground\r\nI'd be the dreadful need in the devotee\r\nThat made him turn around\n\nAnd I'd be the immediate forgiveness\n\nIn Eurydice\n\nImagine being loved by me!\n\n\n\nI won't deny I've got in my mind now all the things we'd do\n\nSo I'll try to talk refined for fear that you find out how I'm imaginin' you\n\n\n\nI'd be the last shred of truth\n\nIn the lost myth of true love\n\nI'd be the sweet feeling of relief\n\nMankind now dreams of\n\nThat's found in the last witness\n\nBefore the wave hits\n\nMarvelling at God\n\nBefore he feels alone\n\nOne final time\n\nAnd marries the sea\n\nImagine being loved by me\n\n\n\nI won't deny I've got in my mind now all the things I would do\n\nSo I'll try to talk refined for fear that you find out how I'm imaginin' you\n\nI won't deny I've got in my mind now all the things we could do\n\nSo I'll try to talk refined for fear that you find out how I'm imaginin' you",
