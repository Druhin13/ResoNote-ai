  "lyrics": "No matter who you are or where you come from\r\nAnybody can be anybody, anyone you want\r\nNobody, no, nobody can tell us what to see\r\nWhen we dream\r\nSeventeen on a beach in an old Toyota truck\n\nWheels in the sand, guitar in hand, oh no, we weren't stuck\n\nTalking 'bout who we wanna be, talking 'bout where we wanna go\n\nYeah, I remember feeling like we were already on the road\n\n\n\nWe dream to escape, we dream to let go\n\nTo feel what it's like walking streets of gold\n\nTurn grey skies blue, turn hope into truth\n\nYeah, somedays, sometimes all you can do is\n\nDream from small towns of big city lights\n\nTurn a heartbreak into love at first sight\n\nWhen we look at the world and we don't like what we see\n\nWe close our eyes and we dream\n\n\n\nNo matter who you are or where you come from\n\nAnybody can be anybody, anyone you want\n\nNobody, no, nobody can tell us what to see\n\nWhen we dream\n\n\n\nOne did it all, jumped a plane, landed in LA\n\nOne's on and endless summer, tryna find the perfect way\n\nAnd I'm half way across the world, I'm still up here on stage\n\nOnly the cities and the songs and the faces have changed\n\n\n\nWe dream to escape, we dream to let go\n\nTo feel what it's like walking streets of gold\n\nTurn grey skies blue, turn hope into truth\n\nYeah, somedays, sometimes all you can do is\n\nDream from small towns of big city lights\n\nTurn a heartbreak into love at first sight\n\nWhen we look at the world and we don't like what we see\n\nWe close our eyes and we dream\n\n\n\nYeah, look at me right here and look at us right now\n\nLook how far we've come, we're still running 'em down\n\nLike we did when we were kids in a truck on a beach at seventeen\n\nYeah, we dream\n\n\n\nWe dream to escape, we dream to let go\n\nTo feel what it's like walking streets of gold\n\nTurn grey skies blue, turn hope into truth\n\nYeah, somedays, sometimes all you can do is\n\nDream from small towns of big city lights\n\nTurn a heartbreak into love at first sight\n\nWhen we look at the world and we don't like what we see\n\nWe close our eyes and we dream\n\n\n\nSo we dream",
