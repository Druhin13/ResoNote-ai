I run into wrecks with laws\n\nThat didn't like what I stood for\n\nOr didn't like rap music\n\nOr just didn't like black folks in general\n\nMan, the law was lookin' after me this whole time\n\nEvery time there was one that was dangerous that could get me\n\nI had five or six that was on my side that kept that...\n\nKept that motherfucker in check, man\n\n\n\nI know a'lotta people locked up, sittin' in cells\n\nEither for shit that they did or shit they didn't do well\n\nBut for every cat that's locked up, definitely guilty\n\nThere's another brother innocent in prison, you feel me?\n\nSee this country we live in is really all about the bottom line\n\nAnd when they see these young black men, they see dollar signs\n\nSo prisons go from bein' run by the state\n\nTo a private industry, nigga, tell me, can you relate?\n\nSee when education in the schools is [?] for the testin'\n\nThey can't keep up the fundin' 'cause kids can't keep up the lesson\n\nThey get frustrated with the process and head to the streets\n\nAnd find some alternative ways to get 'em somethin' to eat\n\nYou got draconian laws in place as mandated by the state\n\nProbation terms you can't meet so you know you gon' violate\n\nNow you makin' license plates, scratchin' the ten year itch\n\nYour prison an industrial complex, man, stop bein' a bitch\n\nYou a bitch!\n\n\n\nYou see a lotta people in the penitentiary make statements like\n\n\"I ain't never comin' back here,\" you know?\n\nAnd I made statements when I was on the street\n\nThat I was never goin'\n\nSo, I don't say never anymore\n\nYou don't know what, you don't know what's in store\n\nWhat I will say is this\n\nI'mma stay positive out here, I'mma do the right thing\n\nYou know, I'm not gonna, uh, make no moves\n\nTo put myself in the crosshairs\n\nWhere these people can just cross me out and [?]\n\n\n\nThis niggas told me he sold dope, I said what do that mean?\n\nHe said I sell you some white or I could sell you some green\n\nGotta pocket full of pills and a cup of that lean\n\nMan, I'm just keepin' it trill, I slap the hat off his bean\n\nYou niggas kill me runnin' 'round, talkin' 'bout you sell drugs\n\nMoved a couple quarter pounds now you swear you the plug?\n\nOh, my bad, you got them birds that fly away every month\n\nYou keep them keys? Nigga please, why you tryna' front?\n\nSee you can have all the coca leaves that they grow in Columbia\n\nThen serve up all the snorters and the smokers and numb 'em up\n\nWith stacks up to the ceilin', big doggin' like Marmaduke\n\nStill won't see a tenth of the paper that big Pharma do\n\nThey don't care about the cure, they just wanna sell a treatment\n\nKeep you alive while keepin' you high, now that's some street shit\n\nUsin' people's pain for profit, gettin' rich\n\nHey yo, pharmaceutical companies, stop bein' a bitch\n\n'Cause you a bitch!\n\n\n\nBut, but at the same time, I ain't gon' let nobody hurt me\n\nI'm not gon' let nobody hurt my family\n\nAnd I will kill you if you come around my kids with that hood shit",
