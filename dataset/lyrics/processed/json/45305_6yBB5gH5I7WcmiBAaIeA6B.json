  "lyrics": "You said that we would always be\r\nWithout you I feel lost at sea\r\nThrough the darkness you'd hide with me\r\nLike the wind we'd be wild and free\r\nYou said you'd follow me anywhere\n\nBut your eyes tell me you won't be there\n\n\n\nI've gotta learn how to love without you\n\nI've gotta carry my cross without you\n\nStuck in the middle and I'm just about to\n\nFigure it out without you\n\nAnd I'm done sitting home without you\n\nFuck I'm going on without you\n\nI'm gonna tear this city down without you\n\nI'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you\n\n\n\nNow I'm running away my dear\n\nFrom myself and the truth I fear\n\nMy heart is beating I can't see clear\n\nHow I'm wishing that you were here\n\n\n\nYou said you'd follow me anywhere\n\nBut your eyes tell me you won't be there\n\n\n\nI've gotta learn how to love without you\n\nI've gotta carry my cross without you\n\nStuck in the middle and I'm just about to\n\nFigure it out without you\n\nAnd I'm done sitting home without you\n\nFuck I'm going out without you\n\nI'm gonna tear this city down without you\n\nI'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you",
