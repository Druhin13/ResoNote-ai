  "lyrics": "All the fear in my bones\r\nVoices drag me down\r\nHaunted by my ghosts\r\nCircles round and round\r\nAnd feeling my demons\n\nGo ahead and break, fall apart\n\nThis coat of armor feeds off the hurt\n\nAnd the scars, makes me stronger\n\nIt's blood and veins but it gives me my strength\n\nThis heart can take all the pain\n\nIt's what it's made for\n\nIt's what it's made for\n\n\n\nFeel the fire in my chest\n\nLet it burn, let it spread\n\nComes alive, ash to ash\n\nCircles round and round\n\nAnd embracing my demons\n\n\n\nGo ahead and break, fall apart\n\nThis coat of armor feeds off the hurt\n\nAnd the scars, makes me stronger\n\nIt's blood and veins but it gives me my strength\n\nThis heart can take all the pain\n\nIt's what it's made for\n\nIt's what it's made for\n\nIt's what it's made for\n\nIt's what it's made for",
