  "lyrics": "I'm a troubled man, changed by the things I do\r\nTrue, but it's funny how they all remember you\r\nIt all could be different, time to do something new\r\nI've given everything, I want to be a happy man too\r\nGot to understand, blamed by the friends I lose\r\nWho's getting outta hand, do you think they depend on you?\n\nIt all could be different, try to do something new\n\nI've given everything, I want to be a happy man too\n\n\n\nBuy yourself a dream, how's it looking?\n\nBuy yourself a car and a house to live in\n\nGet yourself a girl, someone different\n\nBuy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing\n\n\n\nGonna run it 'round, strange but it just won't do, no\n\nWhen it's coming down, taking a hold on you\n\nIt all could be different, try to do something new\n\nGiven everything, all to be a happy man too\n\n\n\nBuy yourself a dream, how's it looking?\n\nBuy yourself a car and a house to live in\n\nGet yourself a girl, someone different\n\nBuy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing\n\n\n\nCloser\n\nTurning it over\n\nIt all could be different\n\nCloser\n\nTime to do something new\n\nI've given everything all to be a happy man too\n\n\n\nBuy yourself a dream, how's it looking?\n\nBuy yourself a car and a house to live in\n\nGet yourself a girl, someone different\n\nBuy yourself a dream\n\n\n\nNo, I won't let it tame or twist me\n\nI just got told that I gotta move on\n\nNo, I won't let it tame or twist me\n\nI just got told that I gotta move on",
