  "lyrics": "Her lips on mine\r\nSoft glow of the cold beer sign\r\nHer eyes that night\r\nThey had me hypnotized\r\nTwo hearts collide\n\nI should have held on tight\n\nCan't get her off my mind\n\n\n\nShe moved me, she lit me up like a fire\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nShe stole my heart, she haunts my soul like a ghost\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\n\n\nWe danced real close\n\nI was under her control\n\nShe whispered in my ear\n\n\"Let's get out of here\"\n\nYeah, let's get out of here\n\n\n\nShe moved me, she lit me up like a fire\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nShe stole my heart, she haunts my soul like a ghost\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\n\n\nShe disappeared in the morning sun\n\nJust like that she was gone\n\n\n\nShe moved me, she lit me up like a fire\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nShe stole my heart, she haunts my soul like a ghost\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\n\n\nShe moved me, she lit me up like a fire\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nShe stole my heart, she haunts my soul like a ghost\n\nBurning through the neon\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nBurning, she's burning\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nBurning through the neon smoke\n\nBurning through the neon smoke",
