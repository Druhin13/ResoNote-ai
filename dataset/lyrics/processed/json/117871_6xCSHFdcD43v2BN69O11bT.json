(I'm not perfect)\n\nYou know, don't judge me 'cause I don't judge\n\n\n\nAin't been to no funerals lately, my partners, they dead or in jail\n\nI fought the pain for a long time, I tried a lot and I failed\n\nBut now it's time to excel, they come on a metric ton scale\n\nSay hold on to the guard rail, flyin' outta here\n\nFrom takin' a trip to supply to takin' a trip to Dubai\n\nI done been shitted on by a lotta rappers and it don't at all matter\n\nThe ones that fuck with me know I'm one-thousand, they know I'm all action\n\nI'm a big general, I could send a load, a brick, bread winner in life\n\nI could cook off the pot or a base scale I could lock\n\nRe-compress fire ton in a box\n\nGuerilla hustle, I done been on the block\n\n\n\nHavin' my way with the money, yeah, that shit keep comin' and comin'\n\nRan through the stack, I get rack on a rack, I keep thumpin' and thumpin'\n\nI did a show, caught a case on that road, I ain't runnin' from nothin'\n\nGod on my side, I got nothin' to hide, now I'm runnin' from nothin'\n\nGod got me, woke me up, took me in\n\nSet me down, broke me down, said make me proud\n\nI came up, I rose up out the mud\n\nCan't trust nobody so in God I trust",
