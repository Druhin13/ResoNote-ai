  "lyrics": "Time after time, time after time\r\nThe skies are darkening they grow so dim\r\nStrangers are meeting but it never ends\r\nAnd one day they'll remember, one day they will know\r\n(Time after time)\n\nFrom far away there comes a warning sound\n\nAnd no one listens but it's all around\n\nAnd one day they'll remember, one day they will know\n\n\n\nChorus: Time after time, no hiding anywhere\n\nTime after time, the visions in the air\n\nTime after time, they come from everywhere\n\n\n\n(Time after time)\n\nTime after time\n\nJust listen to the sirens of the world\n\nThey breathe a whisper waiting for the word\n\nAnd one day they'll remember, one day they will know\n\n\n\n(Time after time)\n\nTime after time it is the same old story\n\nAnother footstep on the trail of glory\n\nAnd one day they'll remember, one day they will know\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nThe beauty of the earth from way up high\n\nShines like a jewel on the velvet sky\n\nAnd one day they'll remember, one day they will know\n\n\n\nThe skies are darkening they grow so dim\n\nStrangers are meeting but it never ends\n\nAnd one day they'll remember, one day they will know\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nEmit retfa emit, no hiding anywhere\n\nEmit retfa emit, no visions in the air\n\nThey come from everywhere",
