  "lyrics": "For God so loved the world \nThat he gave his only Son Whosoever believes will not perish \nThey shall have Eternal life \nI shall hold to the cross I shall hold to God alone For his love has salvaged me \nFor his love has set me free \n\nI shall wait upon the Lord I shall wait upon his word By his grace I am released By his grace I am redeemer \n\nBy His precious blood\n\nI have been set free\n\nFor the glory of Jesus'name\n\nI surrender all Now to Christ alone In Jesus I am saved",
