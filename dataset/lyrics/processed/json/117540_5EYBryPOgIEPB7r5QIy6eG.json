  "lyrics": "Sunrise with you on my chest\r\nNo blinds in the place where I live\r\nDaybreak open your eyes\r\n'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night\r\nStill, we're changing our minds here\r\nBe yours, be my dear\n\nSo close with you on my lips\n\nTouch noses, feeling your breath\n\nPush your heart and pull away, yeah\n\nBe my summer in a winter day love\n\nI can't see one thing wrong\n\nBetween the both of us\n\nBe mine, be mine, yeah\n\nAnytime, anytime\n\n\n\nOoh you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I\n\nI thought I knew it all\n\nFound love but I was wrong\n\nMore times than enough\n\nBut since you came along\n\nI'm thinking baby\n\n\n\nYou are bringing out a different kind of me\n\nThere's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free\n\nFalling all in\n\nYou fell for men who weren't how they appear\n\nTrapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free\n\nFalling all in you\n\n\n\nFast forward a couple years, yeah\n\nGrown up in the place that we live\n\nMake love, then we fight\n\nLaugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night baby\n\nI guess we can't control\n\nWhat's just not up to us\n\nBe mine, be mine, yeah\n\nAnytime, anytime\n\n\n\nOoh you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I\n\nI thought I knew it all\n\nFound love but I was wrong\n\nMore times than enough\n\nBut since you came along\n\nI'm thinking baby\n\n\n\nYou are bringing out a different kind of me\n\nThere's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free\n\nFalling all in\n\nYou fell for men who weren't how they appear\n\nTrapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free\n\nFalling all in you\n\n\n\nEvery time I see you baby I get lost\n\nIf I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up\n\nEvery night I'm with you I fall more in love\n\nNow I'm laying by your side\n\nEverything feels right since you came along\n\nI'm thinking baby\n\n\n\nYou, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me\n\nThere's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free\n\nFalling all in\n\nYou fell for men who weren't how they appear (Ooh)\n\nTrapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free\n\nFalling all in",
