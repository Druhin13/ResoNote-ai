  "lyrics": "When I woke this morning\r\nit was already night\r\nSaw a number on the phone\r\nthat I don't recognize I know\r\nI've been across this land like ten times now\n\nI've seen every little corner of your two bit town\n\nI know\n\nWhere I'm going\n\n\n\nBright lights they won't leave me alone\n\nNeed a shadow or a hole in the wall\n\nBaby I don't know\n\nI don't know what kind of state I'm in\n\nWe've got a ways to go\n\nBeen around this whole town by now\n\nI can't tell you how you're supposed to get out\n\nBaby I don't know\n\nI don't know what kind of state I'm in\n\nWe've got a ways to go\n\n\n\nI'm an ordinary man a wheel on the cage\n\nI've never been this lost\n\nbut I don't wanna have to stay\n\nIn the morning I'm leaving\n\nAnd I don't know where I'm going\n\n\n\nBright lights they won't leave me alone\n\nNeed a shadow or a hole in the wall\n\nBaby I don't know\n\nI don't know what kind of state I'm in\n\nWe've got a ways to go\n\nBeen around this whole town by now\n\nI can't tell you how you're supposed to get out\n\nBaby I don't know\n\nI don't know what kind of state I'm in\n\nWe've got a ways to go",
