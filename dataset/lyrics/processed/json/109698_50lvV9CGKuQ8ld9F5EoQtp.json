  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Nostalgia par MØ (Karen Marie Ørsted)\r\nI remember the first time I was in love\nIt was all the way back in 1997\nI stole my mama's cell phone, yes, and I was turning it up\nTracked down your number, boy\nI was so in love, I thought I was in heaven\n\nIt was so beautiful, the love we had, the love we had\nCan't believe we let it pass, we let it pass\nSo beautiful, but you were right, yes you were right\nWe couldn't last, but what a blast we had\n\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\n\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\n\nI remember the first time they caught us drinking\nWe were out there hanging on our bicycles blowing wheels\nI had stole my dad's liquor, yeah, and we were turning it up\nHigh as a kite and we were so in love, so high above\n\nSo beautiful, the love we had, the love we had\nCan't believe we let it pass, we let it pass\nSo beautiful, but you were right, yes you were right\n\nWe couldn't last, but what a blast we had\n\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\n\nCome and grab my hand, honey\nDon't you wanna be wild with me?\nJust like we used to be back then, oh, oh, oh, oh\nCome and grab my hand, honey\nDon't you wanna dance with me?\nJust like we used to do so devoted to the music\n\n\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks\nI know you're hurting, I know your heart, it aches\nFor someone's lovin', ooh ooh\nBut the sun shines when the cloud breaks",
