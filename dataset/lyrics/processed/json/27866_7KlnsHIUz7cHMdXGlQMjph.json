  "lyrics": "Here am I\r\nThe divided self\r\nMy head spinning like a carousel\r\nThe world outside may still be beautiful\r\nBut I love this cell\n\nCome over\n\nYou are still sane\n\nI could give you just a little brawn if you give me a little brains\n\nIt’s a mess in here, I’ve been drinking\n\nMyself blind again\n\n\n\nMy legs are numb, I just can’t get up\n\nWill you stay through the theatre\n\nOf my self-pity, my lechery?\n\n\n\nI’m waiting for your guiding light to bring me back\n\n\n\nI’m waiting for your guiding light to bring me back\n\nTo the power and the glory\n\n\n\nTo the power and the glory\n\n\n\nSend messages\n\nOld suggestive shit\n\nI know that it will catch me up, but I just can’t help it\n\nThere’s an emptiness in my core\n\nIt’s embarrassing\n\n\n\nReel me in\n\nYes I will confess\n\nI’m numb and I don’t give a fuck ‘cause it’s all just surface\n\nWhy can’t you and I just let go\n\nAnd take all the risks?\n\n\n\nMy legs are numb, I just can’t get up\n\nWill you stay through the theatre\n\nOf my self-pity, my lechery?\n\n\n\nI’m waiting for your guiding light to bring me back\n\n\n\nI’m waiting for your guiding light to bring me back\n\nTo the power and the glory\n\n\n\nThe power and the glory\n\n\n\nTo the power and the glory\n\n\n\nTo the power and the glory\n\n\n\nI’m waiting for your guiding light to bring me back\n\n\n\nI’m waiting for your guiding light to bring me back",
