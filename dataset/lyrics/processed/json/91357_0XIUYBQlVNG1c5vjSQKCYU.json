  "lyrics": "There are no wrong roads\r\nAnd no window stays closed\r\nLove is always sad when it fades\r\nThe glass is better stained anyways\r\nIf never you find what you’re looking for\n\nCome on back to the front porch\n\nSay my name through the screen door\n\nCome on back to the front porch\n\nWhatever you’ve done it doesn’t matter\n\n'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered\n\nBut the light is on, what you waiting for?\n\nCome on back, come on back to the front porch\n\n\n\nWe carved a story in these boards\n\nWatching life go back and forth\n\nOh, and you take it all for granted when you leave\n\nAnd then it takes a while to realize what you need\n\n\n\nIf never you find what you’re looking for\n\nCome on back to the front porch\n\nSay my name through the screen door\n\nCome on back to the front porch\n\nWhatever you’ve done it doesn’t matter\n\n'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered\n\nBut the light is on, what you waiting for?\n\nCome on back, come on back\n\n\n\nI took the long way\n\nLooking for the shortcut\n\nTo find out that this place\n\nWas made of the best of us\n\n\n\nIf never you find what you’re looking for\n\nCome on back to the front porch\n\nSay my name through the screen door\n\nCome on back to the front porch\n\nWhatever you’ve done it doesn’t matter\n\n'Cause darling we're all a little splintered and battered\n\nBut the light is on, what you waiting for?\n\nCome on back, come on back\n\nCome on back, come on back to the front porch",
