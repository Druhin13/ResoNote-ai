  "lyrics": "I don't wanna be another skeleton in your closet\r\nAnother rose that you throw, 'cause you know that it ain't okay\r\nJust a name on a stone in a row down the road forgotten\r\n'Cause I was falling fast, now I'm just a dash between two dates\r\nAnd I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard\n\nIn the cold, hard dirt that you throw down\n\nI don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar\n\nSo you can find another...\n\nHopeless, broken girl in a little black dress\n\nAnd you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace\n\nRight here next to me\n\n\n\nMaybe I was naive to believe you would never hurt me\n\nBut now I know why you hide in your darkest suit and shades\n\nYou put on a show, so nobody knows your hands and your shoes are dirty\n\nI guess you don't need a shovel to dig a grave\n\n\n\nAnd I don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard\n\nIn the cold, hard dirt that you throw down\n\nI don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar\n\nSo you can find another...\n\nHopeless, broken girl in a little black dress\n\nAnd you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace\n\nRight here next to me, yeah\n\n\n\nYou gonna go out one night when you see me out\n\n'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down\n\nYeah, you gonna go out one night when you see me out\n\n'Cause the ghost of a broken heart don't stay six feet down\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be another heart in your graveyard\n\nIn the cold, hard dirt that you throw down\n\nI don't wanna watch you drive away in a black car to a new bar\n\nSo you can find another...\n\nHopeless, broken girl in a little black dress\n\nAnd you take her, break her, lay her heart to rest in peace\n\nRight here next to me\n\nHopeless, broken girl\n\nAnd you just take her, break her heart\n\nLet her rest in peace\n\nRight there next to me\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be another heart\n\nI don't wanna be another heart\n\nIn your graveyard, babe\n\nIn your graveyard, hey",
