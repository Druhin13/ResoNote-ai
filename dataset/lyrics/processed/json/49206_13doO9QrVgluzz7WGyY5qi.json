  "lyrics": "She's got eyes of fire that burn like a shot of whiskey\r\nAnd she's been known to bring a man to his knees\r\nShe'll take all you have\r\nYou never see it coming\r\nThat's how I know the devil is a woman\r\nWell Mister Johnson knows cause he saw her up close\n\nSaid man if you don't mind would you tune this guitar for me\n\nBut she took his soul and she broke his heart\n\nJust for fun\n\nAnd that's how I know the devil is a woman\n\nThat's how I know\n\nTemptation is her game\n\nShe'll make you want to \n\nAnything that she wants you to\n\nAnd just when you think that you understand her\n\nEverything changes \n\nEverything changes \n\nAnd that's how I know \n\nCharly swears that he saw her somewhere down in Georgia\n\nHe says she plays a pretty mean fiddle it's true\n\nOh believe him though he got that fiddle of gold\n\nShe will never admit that you’ve won”\n\nAnd that's how I know the devil is a woman\n\nThat's how I know the devil is a woman",
