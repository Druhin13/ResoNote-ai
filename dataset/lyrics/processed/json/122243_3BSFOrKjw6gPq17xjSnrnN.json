  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson So Badly par JMSN\r\nYou know I love u so madly\nAnd I want it so badly everyday\nYou know I love u so madly\nYou know I just can't live this way\nYou know I love u so madly\nAnd I want it so badly everyday\nYou know I love u so madly\nI just can't wait another day\n\nSee the night is young and I'm overcome with these feelings\nAs I lay in the bed and watch you get dressed\nWith my hands behind my head I start to wonder\nDo I really have what it takes to get you off?\n'Cause you got some real sex appeal and I'm not a man of steel\n\nAnd the way you put on that suede pussycat\nMakes me think you know exactly how I feel\nSo what's the deal?\nAm I not what you want?\nDid my past take all the confidence I once had?\n'Cause you keep saying it's you and you got a lot on your mind\nBut that don't help\nI still blame myself\n\nNow listen\n\nDays, days they seem so long\nLivin' without you\nEverything's so blue\nWithout love\nI'm just draggin' on\nSo tell me where I went wrong\n\n'Cause I just can't go on\n\nYou know I love u so madly\nAnd I want it so badly everyday\nYou know I love u so madly\nYou know I just can't live this way\nYou know I love u so madly\nAnd I want it so badly everyday\nYou know I love u so madly\nI just can't wait another day\n\nWaves, waves they come and go\nEverybody knows\nWhere the river flows\n(and when we die we all turn into stars)\nAnd we'll glow just like the sun\nWe all come undone\nAnd 2 becomes 1\n\n'Cause our new lives have just begun\n\nYou know I love u so madly\nAnd I want it so badly everyday\nYou know I love u so madly\nYou know I just can't live this way\nYou know I love u so madly\nAnd I want it so badly everyday\nYou know I love u so madly\nI just can't wait another day",
