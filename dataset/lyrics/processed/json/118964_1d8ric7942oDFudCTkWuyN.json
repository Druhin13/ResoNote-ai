  "lyrics": "It's hard for me\r\nIt's not the way I wanna tell it's got to be\r\nWe rushed in the walls and you fell so deep, fell so deep\r\nMy heart should come with a warning\r\nI ruin everything\n\nTold you to pack your things then pull me closer\n\nI'm so selfish, God made me a sinner\n\nHonestly you'll be better on your own away from me\n\nNow's your chance to leave\n\n\n\nI let you in\n\nI let you down\n\nI chewed you up\n\nI spit you out\n\nAnd we're far from fixing it now\n\n\n\nIt's gonna take a miracle\n\nWe give and we take\n\nAnd we take what we need and we go (and we go)\n\nSo it's gonna take a miracle\n\nIt's gonna take a miracle\n\nWe give and we take\n\nAnd we take what we need\n\nAnd I'll be the reason I don't believe in miracles\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nYou're killing me\n\nYou suck me dry\n\nA happiness is chivalry\n\nI wanna take back things I said that last forever\n\nSeems like we could swim August all the way November\n\nAnd all your friends fucked up my guest list on Coachella\n\nI can't even be alone with you\n\nYou say you miss the thought of me holding you\n\n\n\nSomething bigger than ourselves is coming over you\n\nYou threw out words like \"I love you, \"I love you too\"\n\nAnd started throwing bowls and plates inside the kitchen\n\nYou wonder why I started pouring up and started sipping colors\n\n\n\nI let you in\n\nI let you down\n\nI chew you up\n\nI spit you out\n\nAnd we're far from fixing it now\n\n\n\nIt's gonna take a miracle\n\nWe give and we take\n\nAnd we take what we need and we go (and we go)\n\nSo it's gonna take a miracle\n\nIt's gonna take a miracle\n\nWe give and we take\n\nAnd we take what we need\n\nAnd I'll be the reason I don't believe in miracles",
