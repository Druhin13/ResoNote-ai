  "lyrics": "A rebel fell from grace to a hell called “Earth”. \nHe said, “Don’t y'all worry, my friends. \nYou’ll get your money’s worth.” \nFor every sun there comes a moon. \nA rebel fell from grace, to a hell called “Earth”. \nHe said, “Don’t y'all worry, my friends. \n\nYou’ll get your money’s worth.” \n\nFor every sun there comes a moon. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night…the night…the night. Dig your hands into the ash and sift through once was. \n\nDeath upon death you’ll find, and all just because for every rise there is a fall. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night…the night…the night. And into heaven came the night.\n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night. \n\nAnd into heaven came the night.",
