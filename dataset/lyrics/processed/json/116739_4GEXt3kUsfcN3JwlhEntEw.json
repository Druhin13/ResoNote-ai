  "lyrics": "Even when everything was gone\r\nEven when I got lonely\r\nI never thought that we were wrong\r\nEven with just your memory\r\nWe had it all but you're gone and I've tried\n\nBut I'm still hungry\n\n\n\nDancing in your blue dress\n\nSwaying to the music slowly (slowly)\n\nI'm singing and I'm smoking\n\nEven though you hate it you still kiss me (kiss me)\n\n\n\nYou had to walk away from me\n\nYou had to do some thinking\n\nDon't wanna cry each time you leave\n\nI'll probably end up drinking\n\n\n\nYou had a voice it could drown out the noise\n\nAnd now it's silent\n\nNow when I walk there's no sound, I don't talk\n\nI just stay quiet\n\n\n\nDancing in your blue dress\n\nSwaying to the music slowly (slowly)\n\nI'm singing and I'm smoking\n\nEven though you hate it you still kiss me (kiss me)\n\n\n\nLater in October\n\nNeither of us sober\n\nLaughing\n\nI told you that I loved you\n\nYou just sorta smiled and then you kissed me\n\n\n\nEven when everything was gone\n\nEven when I got lonely\n\nI never thought that we were wrong\n\nEven with just your memory",
