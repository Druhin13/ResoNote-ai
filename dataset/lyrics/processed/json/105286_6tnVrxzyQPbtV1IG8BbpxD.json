  "lyrics": "My baby is a freak like me and she knows just what I like\r\nShe carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find\r\nShe won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls\r\nIf they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love\r\nMy queen got machine gun hips, better duck once they go off\n\nTakes aim, no intentions to miss, oh-my, so help us all\n\nAnd it's close to a flight in the midst of neon lights\n\nAnd my neighbors, they greet me with bags under their eyes\n\nAnd they know why\n\n\n\nMy baby is a freak like me and she knows just what I like\n\nShe carries all the keys to the places that no one dares to find\n\nShe won't tell nobody what goes on in these walls\n\nIf they talked, they'd probably tell you all about love\n\n\n\nOh, concubine, what are you made of?\n\nNo resource on this earth is that soft\n\nI swear by God you are an angel\n\nIronic how you help me raise hell\n\n\n\nI let it go, surrender control\n\nAs she takes me for a ride\n\nHands in the air, we offer our souls\n\nIt's easy when she's on my mind",
