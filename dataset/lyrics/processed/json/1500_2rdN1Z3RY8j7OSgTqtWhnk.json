I saw love\n\nTrust me when I say it's not you\n\nJust try to see my point of view\n\nThis shit gets hard\n\n\n\nI make money, share my time\n\nI need something to be mine\n\nFor me, for me, for me, for me, for me\n\nI'm impatient, give me space\n\nAlways working, far away\n\nFor me, for me, for me, for me, for me\n\n\n\nPlease don't be so hard (be so hard), so hard on my heart (on my heart)\n\nI'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms\n\nPlease don't be so cold (be so cold)\n\nBe patient while I grow (while I grow)\n\nI wanna try, I won't always get it right but I need you to know\n\nTo go easy on me\n\nGo easy, go easy on me\n\nGo easy, go easy\n\nGo easy on me\n\nGo easy\n\n\n\nLa la la, la la la (go easy)\n\nLa la la, la la la (go easy)\n\nLa la la, la la, la la (on me)\n\nLa la la, la la la (go easy)\n\nLa la la, la la la (go easy)\n\nLa la la, la la, la la (on me)\n\n\n\nOh, please don't be so hard, so hard on my heart\n\nI'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms\n\nGo easy on me\n\nGo easy on me\n\nGo easy on me\n\n\n\nWhat, darling? \n\nYou know you're never alone my angel, take it easy\n\nDon't over do it\n\nEnjoy, but don't abuse yourself, alright?\n\n\n\nOkay\n\n\n\nAnd it was lovely seeing you\n\nAnd I pray the best to you, see you again soon\n\nGood luck with the new shows and whatever you are doing over there\n\nVery proud of you, good luck",
