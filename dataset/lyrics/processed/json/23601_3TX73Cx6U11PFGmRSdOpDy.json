  "lyrics": "He was Johnny the spy, he was red hot, walked slow and smoked light\r\nShe was Jukebox Jenny, anyone hit, with big eyes and bright red lips\r\nI said hey, yeah-hey-hey\r\nThey eased on out to the centre of the floor\r\nThey started dancing like never before\r\nShe's spinnin' like crazy, crashing into the crowd\n\nAnd took two tables, screaming mile out loud\n\nChorus:\n\nI wanna rock this joint (rock this joint), I wanna take this town\n\n'Cos I light up when the sun goes down\n\nI wanna rock this joint (rock this joint), I wanna shake this place\n\n'Cos I wanna die with a smile on my face\n\nI said hey, yeah-hey-hey, I said hey, yeah-hey-hey\n\nThe whole damn place lay a little street, climbing on kites, high in the sheet\n\nOff on brew, Janet jived with his date, the cops come by, it was far too late\n\nI said hey, a-hey\n\nAnd Johnny came to, his head was a mess\n\nWoke up, dreamed by skin-tight dress\n\nHe found a loose end at the end of his bed\n\nBut the words can't get right out of his head\n\nchorus\n\n(Solo)\n\nI wanna rock this joint (rock this joint), I wanna take this town\n\nI wanna rock this joint (rock this joint), I wanna shake this place\n\n'Cos I light up when the sun goes down\n\n'Cos I wanna die with a smile on my face\n\nI said hey, yeah-hey-hey, I said hey, yeah-hey-hey\n\nHey, hey-hey-hey (repeats 4x)\n\nHey",
