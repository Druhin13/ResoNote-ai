  "lyrics": "Are the words by an old photograph\r\n'Rustic old doors made by a million years'\r\nWaiting for the train around sunset\r\nFind a frenzy like no one cares\r\nWaiting for a plan to fall\n\nSatellite voice gets lost and bounces away to the moon\n\nBe there soon on the L train to Williamsburg\n\nWaiting for a plan to fall\n\nSatellite voice gets lost and bounces away to the moon\n\nBe there soon on the L train to Williamsburg\n\n\n\nPassing by an old guitar factory\n\nWalking shelves of dreams to refer\n\nRealize, though see trains see unfamiliar\n\nThe working class on time\n\n\n\nEveryone speaks their own movie\n\nMaking dialog in designer pints\n\nTake to the forgotten places\n\nFor the real world contract, a year of surprise\n\n\n\nWaiting for a plan to fall\n\nSatellite voice gets lost and bounces away to the moon\n\nBe there soon on the L train to Williamsburg\n\nWaiting for a plan to fall\n\nSatellite voice gets lost and bounces away to the moon\n\nBe there soon on the L train to Williamsburg",
