  "lyrics": "When you rust red like blood I wonder\r\nWhose house is this? A spell I'm under\r\nWho's wrapped in bed and sweetly sleeping?\r\nI carve my name into the ceiling\r\nYou'll always control me\n\nYou'll always control\n\nYou'll always control me\n\nYou'll always have control\n\n\n\nTake my madness beneath your heel\n\nEven if it begs\n\n\n\nPainting myself in all four corners\n\nNear the furthest room from the front door\n\nWhose house is this? A gift was promised\n\nFuture structures till we all vanish\n\n\n\nYou'll always control me\n\nYou'll always control\n\nYou'll always control me\n\nYou'll always have control\n\n\n\nTake my madness beneath your heel\n\nEven if it begs\n\n\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out\n\nMy life in this glass house\n\nImpossible to get out",
