  "lyrics": "Reflections in my mind, thoughts I can't define\r\nMy heart is racing and the night goes on\r\nI can almost hear a laugh, coming from your photograph\r\nFunny how a look can share a thousand meanings\r\nWell-intended lies, contemplating alibies\r\nIs it really you, or is it me I'm blaming\n\nA distant memory flashes over me\n\nEven though you're gone, I feel you deep inside\n\n\n\nDance beneath the light with that look in your eyes\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nI can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few\n\nI won't stop till I'm through loving you, girl\n\n\n\nThere's a window in a heart, I've tried to look through from the start\n\nYou're never really sure what someone else is thinking\n\nSomeone's broken something new, another altered point of view\n\nJust a certain someone's conscience playing\n\n\n\nI held it in my hand, I did not understand\n\nWhat lives inside the wind that cries her name\n\nTried to catch a shooting star, what seems so close can't be that far\n\nI'm living in a dream that's never ending\n\n\n\nDance beneath the light with that look in your eyes\n\n\n\nChorus: I can't stop loving...\n\n\n\nDancing with that look that's in your eyes\n\nChorus (2x): I can't stop loving...",
