  "lyrics": "Well, a goodbye never seems finished\r\nJust like these songs that I write\r\nThey hang aloft like stars in the night\r\nBut there's nothing there but the illusion of a light\r\nAnd you, you could've been mine\r\nYour mother, she's an actress\n\nAnd we're all putting on a play\n\nHere's some conviction, pretend that's all real\n\nTry to ignore how sad it all feels\n\nYes, try not to break her heart if you can\n\n\n\nHold on\n\nTo whatever you can until it's gone\n\nCarry on\n\nFor none of us will be here for too long\n\n\n\nI'll try not to let the world and its darkness bring me down\n\nThink of the love and the beauty I found\n\nThe simple things that I've left behind\n\nOh the way he make me laugh\n\n\n\nBut I hold on\n\nTo whatever I can until it's gone\n\nI'll carry on\n\nFor none of us will be here for too long\n\n\n\nWe are a distant star\n\nBut darling, you're so far away\n\nYou were never meant to stay\n\nI reach out to see\n\nIf you're still here with me\n\nBaby, we could've made it easy\n\nCouldn't we?\n\n\n\nNow I will never know you\n\nYou are just someone passing by\n\nAnd it makes me sad to think about\n\nAll the stories and fates I'll be without\n\nBut I think I'm getting used to the silence now",
