  "lyrics": "I built a ribbon out of moss, plain blue moss\r\nAnd presented it to you on your birthday\r\nYou laughed like the wind was nothing\r\nYour laughter still rattles me every day, hour, always\r\nEstrella\n\nEstrella\n\n\n\nThat was a past life, and that's life\n\nI've been reincarnated into this thing\n\nThat resembles nothing of the former man\n\nBut your breast stood up to celestial law and the ribbon of distance was cut\n\n\n\nEstrella\n\nEstrella\n\n\n\nI was roused and aroused\n\nOnly you can rouse me in that way\n\nLike music, language was blowed out\n\nLike pulling down the sea, like plunging into the stars\n\n\n\nEstrella\n\nEstrella\n\n\n\nIf I am delirious\n\nIt's because you are harboring my tongue, my faithless tongue\n\n\n\nEstrella\n\nEstrella\n\nEstrella\n\nEstrella, Estrella, Estrella\n\nEstrella\n\nEstrella\n\n\n\nEstrella esta noche\n\nVa bien para compartir\n\nEstrella esta noche\n\nVa bien\n\nEstrella esta noche\n\nVa bien para compartir\n\nTonight a star goes well to share",
