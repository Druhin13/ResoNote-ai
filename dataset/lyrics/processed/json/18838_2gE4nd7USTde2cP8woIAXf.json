  "lyrics": "Born burnt inside a black mass\r\nA fraction less than others\r\nA select sickness keep me hid\r\nRavaged by others\r\nWhat craft, obsession brought me down\r\nWhat men see pleasing\n\nBut who, who can I please?\n\n\n\nYou'll stare at me in a fantasy\n\nLove me through the lens\n\nOur memories falling on my knees\n\nTouch me through the fence\n\n\n\nNo future, fear this ugly wave\n\nIt's more trash than water\n\nI'm done sticking for more blood\n\nAnd I just get water\n\nShould I lay with my head bowed down?\n\nExist in exits\n\nBut where, where can I exist?\n\n\n\nYou'll stare at me in a fantasy\n\nLove me through the lens\n\nOur memories falling on my knees\n\nTouch me through the fence\n\n\n\nWhere can I let the ghost in?\n\nWhere can I let the ghost in?\n\nWhere can I let the ghost in?\n\nWhere can I let the ghost in?\n\nWhen rest comes easy fall asleep\n\nLet bad men fail us all\n\n\n\nYou'll stare at me in a fantasy\n\nLove me through the lens\n\nOur memories falling on my knees\n\nTouch me through the fence\n\nYou'll stare at me in a fantasy\n\nLove me through the lens\n\nOur memories falling on my knees\n\nTouch me through the fence",
