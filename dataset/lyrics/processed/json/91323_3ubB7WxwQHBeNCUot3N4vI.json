  "lyrics": "She found the records lying underneath the bed\r\nAll the songs she used to sing\r\nAll the songs she used to play\r\nAll those words, those melodies\r\nAnd the promise of some kind of love\r\nAnd the promise of some kind of love\n\n\n\nWhen we lose what we love\n\nDon't think anything will ever taste the same\n\nWhen we lose what we love\n\nDon't think anything will ever feel as good again\n\nNow I know how much the anger\n\nHowever much the pain\n\nDestroy only enough that enough still remains of\n\nSome kind of love, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love\n\nSome kind of love, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love\n\n\n\nThe songs hadn't changed, every note just the same\n\nBut when she played them once again\n\nAll those words, those melodies\n\nLike better days past and gone, leaving her behind\n\nWith the promise of some kind of love\n\nWith the promise of some kind of love\n\n\n\nWhen we lose what we love\n\nDon't think anything will ever taste the same\n\nWhen we lose what we love\n\nDon't think anything will ever feel as good again\n\nNow I know how much the anger\n\nHowever much the pain\n\nDestroy only enough that enough still remains of\n\nSome kind of love, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love\n\nSome kind of love, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love\n\nSome kind of love\n\n\n\nShe put the records back in their place\n\nAnd straightened her dress, and wiped her face\n\nShe closed and locked the door\n\nAnd left them lying on the floor\n\nAnd she sang\n\nMmmm, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love, mmmm\n\nMmmm, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love, mmmm\n\nMmmm, some kind of love\n\nSome kind of love",
