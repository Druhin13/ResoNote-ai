  "lyrics": "Welcome in\r\nI’ll walk you through the unknown\r\nSay a prayer if you wish\r\nIn my hand\r\nAll of the answers to your nightmares\n\nJust let go of your broken dreams\n\n\n\nLet the journey begin\n\nLike a leaf in the wind\n\nYou’ll be taken away to a world\n\nOf visions unseen\n\n\n\nImagine if\n\nFar beyond the set horizon\n\nNothing can turn into everything\n\nBut hurry before it’s too late\n\nAnd the old Ballerina takes her fall\n\n\n\nLet me show you a place\n\nWhere the blind can see the light\n\nOf a shooting star\n\n\n\nLike a dancer up high\n\nOn a silver string\n\nLet your actions define who you are\n\nTell the stories unheard\n\n\n\nFollow me\n\nI’ll take you to the unknown\n\nDiscover me\n\nLet me in\n\n\n\nPlease honor me\n\nWith the choices you’ve been given\n\nRemember me when my breath is gold\n\nAs the journey begins\n\nLet the stories tell to be your own\n\n\n\nLet me show you a place\n\nWhere the blind can see the light\n\nOf a shooting star\n\n\n\nLike a dancer up high\n\nOn a silver string\n\nLet your actions define who you are\n\nTell the stories unheard\n\n\n\nThough I love you\n\nI’ll leave you forever\n\nPraise the time I was here\n\nCelebrate all our chapter together\n\nHave no fear when I’m gone\n\n\n\nLet me show you a place\n\nWhere the blind can see the light\n\nOf a shooting star\n\n\n\nLike a dancer up high\n\nOn a silver string\n\nLet your actions define who you are\n\nTell the stories unheard",
