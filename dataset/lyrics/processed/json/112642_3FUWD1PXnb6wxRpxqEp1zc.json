  "lyrics": "You holding your phone tight\r\nYou lock it up like Fort Knox\r\nSomething just ain't right\r\nFeels like you’re punching a clock\r\nOur fire is fleeting\r\nI've seen your type before\n\nYou're probably cheating\n\nLate night you sneak out the door\n\n\n\nI pretend I pretend that we’ll work it out\n\nBut you're slipping away\n\nReached the end reached the end if we're honest now\n\nWe'll let go today\n\n\n\nI've seen your DMs\n\nYou don't hide that shit too well\n\nYou're gone for the weekend\n\nBy Monday I'll be outta here\n\nYou say you’re different\n\nBut why your actions the same\n\nYou say I’m trippin\n\nTruth is I'm over your game",
