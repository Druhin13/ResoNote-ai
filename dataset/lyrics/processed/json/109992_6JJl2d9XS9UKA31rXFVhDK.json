I can't be showin' no mercy\n\nI can't be showin' attention to broke niggas, when I know they ain't worth it\n\nI don't be feeling high when I sip plain, so I throw in the purp (throw in the purp)\n\nDirty money helped me pay my ties, I'm hopin' God never curse me (God)\n\nAnd I can't be showin' my tactics\n\nI know these niggas gon' copy the ways, but I can't be over reactin'\n\nWhen they wanna walk in the path you pave, how you supposed to be actin'? (How you supposed to be actin'?)\n\nBut I know most of them cappin' so don't believe what they post in they captions\n\n\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness (showin' no weakness)\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness (showin' no weakness)\n\nHold the forty playin' defense (forty playin' defense)\n\nCan't have my momma on mournin' and weepin' (naw)\n\n\n\nYeah, and I gotta be more persistent (persistent)\n\nLongevity only thing worryin' me, I gotta keep it consistent (consistent)\n\nYou tellin' me you never heard of me? Man, I ain't even convinced\n\nThey reppin' me out in some cities that I ain't even know existed\n\nTouch down on the Europe scene, I was euro steppin' in some Europeans\n\nEuros bustin' out of Mary jeans, holy water lookin' pure and clean\n\nYou hear the style I created, it made me the savior so fuck how they rate it\n\nPop tens by the two when I take it, it's numb in my body, I'm always sedated\n\n(And what you can't do?) And I can't be runnin' 'round helpless (runnin' 'round helpless)\n\nYou had a chance to put on your mans, why niggas is movin' so selfish?\n\nThat's why I never could put my career in the hands of somebody else's\n\nI was just trappin', tryna be the king of rock to becomin' the Elvis\n\n\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness (showin' no weakness)\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness (showin' no weakness)\n\nHold the forty playin' defense (forty playin' defense)\n\nCan't have my momma on mournin' and weepin' (yeah)\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness (showin' no weakness)\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness (showin' no weakness)\n\nHold the forty playin' defense (forty playin' defense)\n\nCan't have my momma on mournin' and weepin'\n\n\n\nYeah, I can't be showin' no weakness\n\nI never told 'em my secrets\n\nI play the corner with my piece\n\nYou know my flow is the deepest\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness, I can't be showin' no weakness\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness, I can't be showin' no weakness\n\nI can't be showin' no weakness, yeah, yeah",
