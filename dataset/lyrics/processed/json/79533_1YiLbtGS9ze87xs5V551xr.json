  "lyrics": "A million old soldiers will fade away\r\nBut a dream goes on forever\r\nI'm left standing here, I've got nothing to say\r\nAll is silent within my dream\r\nA thousand true loves will live and die\n\nBut a dream lives on forever\n\nThe days and the years will go streaking by\n\nBut the time has stopped in my dream\n\n\n\nWe all have our everyday hopes and fears\n\nAnd you'll find no exception in me\n\nBut that doesn't get me through a sea of tears\n\nOver life's biggest tragedy\n\n\n\nYou're so long ago and so far away\n\nBut my dream lives on forever\n\nI guess I believe that I'll see you one day\n\nFor without it there is no dream\n\n\n\nYou're so far away and so long ago\n\nBut my dream goes on forever\n\nAnd how much I loved you you'll never know\n\n'Til you join me within my dream",
