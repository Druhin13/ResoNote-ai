  "lyrics": "Borders and horizon lines\r\nWe're alone but side by side\r\nWe're yet to dream, we're yet to dream\r\nNothing here is what it seems\r\nOh, oh\r\nThere's an animal inside\n\nThere's a fear that won't subside\n\nOf all the things I'll never do\n\nWill I ever follow through?\n\nThere's an animal inside\n\nThere's an animal inside\n\n\n\nHalf awake and almost dead\n\nKeeping empty beds elsewhere\n\nWe're yet to bleed, we're yet to bleed\n\nAll the time and energy\n\nOh, oh\n\nCould we try to reinvent\n\nFeed the head with common sense\n\nThrough the streets and avenues\n\nI'm climbing up the walls with you\n\nClimbing up the walls with you\n\nI'm climbing up the walls with you\n\n\n\nHalf awake and almost dead\n\nKeeping empty beds elsewhere\n\nWe're yet to bleed, we're yet to bleed\n\nAll the time and energy\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\nAnd if we could be still, still, be still\n\nIf we could be still, still, be still",
