  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Walking By par Felix Cartal\r\nI first saw you in the city\nRight between where the cars pass through\nAnd that moment stayed with me\nGuess I fell for the idea of you\nOoh, I can't forget it, get it\nOoh, now I can't sleep\nI first saw you in the city\nI guess I fell for the idea of you\n\nI've been lying here all night\nI keep imagining you and I\nAnd what it would be like\nI can't get you out of my mind\nMaybe I will see you in another life\nI've been lying here all night\nI keep imagining you and I\n\nAnd what it would be like\nI can't get you out of my mind\nBaby, I will see you in another life\n\n'Cause I just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\n\nThe sun was shining down on me\nMy heart was beating faster when you passed through\nTwo strangers lost in New York City\nThere's so much more I wished I knew about you\n\nOoh, I can't forget it, get it\nOoh, and now I can't sleep\nTwo strangers lost in New York City\nThere's so much more I wished I knew about you\n\nI've been lying here all night\nI keep imagining you and I\nAnd what it would be like\nI can't get you out of my mind\nMaybe I will see you in another life\nI've been lying here all night\nI keep imagining you and I\nAnd what it would be like\nI can't get you out of my mind\nBaby, I will see you in another life\n\n'Cause I just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\n\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw you walking by\n'Cause I just saw you walking by\n\nI just saw, I just saw\nI just saw you walking by\nI just saw, I just saw\nI just saw you walking by",
