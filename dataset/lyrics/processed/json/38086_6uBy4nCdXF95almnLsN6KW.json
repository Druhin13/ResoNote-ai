  "lyrics": "You and me and rain on the roof, \nCaught up in a Summer shower,\r\nDrying while it soaks the flowers,\r\nMaybe we'll be caught for hours,\r\nWaiting out the sun. \nYou and me, we're gathered away,\n\nDreaming conversation, \n\nSitting in the hay,\n\nHoney, how long was I laughing, \n\nIn the rain with you,\n\nCause I didn't feel a drop, \n\n√¢??Til the thunder brought us to.\n\nYou and me underneath a roof of tin,\n\nPretty comfy feeling, \n\nHow the rain ain't leaking in,\n\nWe can sit and dry, \n\nJust as long as it can pour,\n\nCause the way it makes you look, \n\nMakes me hope it rains some more.",
