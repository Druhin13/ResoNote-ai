  "lyrics": "Sometimes late at night when the full moon glows\r\nAnd the sleepy back roads on tobacco smoke\r\nOn these yellow dotted lines through these damn high beams\r\nIt takes me back in time to just turned 16\r\nTwo hands on the wheel, one foot on the gas\r\nA picture of us kissing sliding down in the dash\n\nCouple rebel kids sipping on love in a glass\n\nGetting tipsy off of lips but I'm worried that the buzz won't last\n\n\n\nThem red lips with them shades on, she's Hollywood stuck down home\n\nDaisy Duke in my small town in a old truck with her buzz on\n\nShe's dynamite on a Friday night all dressed up for the good time\n\nTrough the tall grass on the river side where you ain't gonna see them city lights\n\nIt's that orange glow from then Cedar logs, dense diesel smoke on a one lane\n\nIt's the hottest song on the radio that makes us feel some type of way\n\nAnd I can't help but think that it won't last forever\n\nTill the time fades my pain or the memories blow up my engine\n\n\n\nSometimes late at night when the full moon glows\n\nAnd the sleepy back roads on tobacco smoke\n\nOn these yellow dotted lines through these damn high beams\n\nIt takes me back in time to just turned 16\n\nTwo hands on the wheel, one foot on the gas\n\nA picture of us kissing sliding down in the dash\n\nCouple rebel kids sipping on love in a glass\n\nGetting tipsy off of lips but I'm worried that the buzz won't last\n\n\n\nLet's get lost on them dirt roads, good songs on that radio\n\nParked behind them hay fields, steaming up then windows (Yeah)\n\nChanging lanes, tangled up like sugar cane\n\nHoping we can live on this buzz and it won't go away\n\nYeah, baby, I'm holding onto these memories\n\nMy high beams doing donuts down in the mudder beam\n\nThe southern breeze blowing and keep reminding me\n\nOf how it was way back when I could see it in my dream\n\n\n\nSometimes late at night when the full moon glows\n\nAnd the sleepy back roads on tobacco smoke\n\nOn these yellow dotted lines through these damn high beams\n\nIt takes me back in time to just turned 16\n\nTwo hands on the wheel, one foot on the gas\n\nA picture of us kissing sliding down in the dash\n\nCouple rebel kids sipping on love in a glass\n\nGetting tipsy off of lips but I'm worried that the buzz won't last\n\n\n\nBuzz won't last, the buzz won't last\n\nTwo rebel kids sipping on love in a glass",
