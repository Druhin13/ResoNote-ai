  "lyrics": "There's a dress in the closet, that I just can't throw away\r\nI know it might sound crazy, but I haven't changed your pillowcase\r\nA heart half full, or half empty\r\nIs half gone either way, with you gone\r\nWhat went wrong?\n\nMaybe the hardest part\n\n'Cause we didn't break this heart\n\nNobody cheated or lied\n\nI still have to live with goodbye\n\nBut how can I just move on?\n\nI've loved you for way too long\n\nI don't want to admit that you're gone\n\nI don't wanna write this song\n\nDon't wanna write this song\n\n\n\nAnother glass of whiskey, by your picture in a frame\n\nI'm playin' all the black keys and cryin' out your name\n\nI'm holdin' on, or lettin' go\n\nIt's gonna kill me either way\n\nWith you gone\n\nOh\n\n\n\nMaybe the hardest part\n\n'Cause we didn't break this heart\n\nNobody cheated or lied\n\nI still have to live with goodbye\n\nBut how can I just move on?\n\nI've loved you for way too long\n\nI don't want to admit that you're gone\n\nI don't wanna write this song\n\nDon't wanna write this song\n\n\n\nBobby pins on the dresser\n\nWilted flowers in a vase\n\nI left a rose on your headstone\n\nI never quite know what to say\n\n\n\nMaybe the hardest part\n\n'Cause we didn't break this heart\n\nNobody cheated or lied\n\nI still have to live with goodbye\n\nBut how can I just move on?\n\nI've loved you for way too long\n\nI don't want to admit that you're gone\n\nI don't wanna write this song\n\nNo, don't wanna write this song\n\nI don't wanna write this song\n\nMmm, don't wanna write this song, whoa",
