  "lyrics": "You weave your spell\r\nYour eyes beckon me\r\nYour lips they speak, lies and misery\r\nI know it's wrong, but I can't turn away\r\nThe flames draw near, they're telling me to stay\n\n(Into the fire) I'm falling\n\n(Into the fire) I'm falling\n\nInto the fire\n\n\n\nYour love burns bright, and yet the flames are cold\n\nThis time I fear, you won't be back no more\n\nWhen will it end, your love consumes my soul\n\nInto the fire, I'm being tempted once more\n\n\n\n(Into the fire) I'm falling\n\n(Into the fire) I'm falling\n\nInto the fire\n\n\n\nTake me back whera I came back\n\nDon't wanna see your face no more\n\nYou broke my heart, now it's not the same\n\nI'm falling, again\n\nI'm falling, again\n\nInto the FIRE",
