  "lyrics": "Hold me close\r\nAnd don't ever let me go\r\nIn your heart I found a home\r\nSomewhere I've never been before\r\nNo one knows\r\nJust where they wanna go\n\nLive your life in growing old\n\nSimple songs and same old stories\n\n\n\nBut we could start a fire\n\nWe could start a fire\n\n\n\nI feel you in my bones, oh oh oh oh oh\n\nFrom my head down to my toes, oh oh oh oh oh\n\nAnd I know it's a long way down\n\nWhile we're caught in between\n\nWon't you stay in the middle with me?\n\n\n\nI will keep you warm\n\nWhen the years make you feel cold\n\nI will follow where you go\n\nI'll be there when you're lonely\n\nI know it's strange\n\nLiving life in different ways\n\nI swear, I'd give you all my days if I could\n\n\n\n'Cause I feel you in my bones, oh oh oh oh oh\n\nFrom my head down to my toes, oh oh oh oh oh\n\nAnd I know it's a long way down\n\nWhile we're caught in between\n\nWon't you stay in the middle with me?\n\n\n\nCan we rush in?\n\nI know there's no way the lights go out\n\nWhen you're so far under my skin\n\nI'll breathe you in\n\nBecause the thought of ever losing you\n\nWould surely turn my life to blue\n\n\n\nI feel you in my bones, oh oh oh oh oh\n\nFrom my head down to my toes, oh oh oh oh oh\n\nI know it's a long way down\n\nWhile we're caught in between\n\nWon't you stay in the middle with me?",
