  "lyrics": "You're just a snap back criminal, you had it coming\r\nWhen you're drunk, you get typical in every kind of way\r\nA digital delusion, your posts don't get too far\r\nIntercepting the visible perception who you are\r\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\nYou can't, so get gone\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\n\n\nYou got a pocket full of rain that just keeps on giving\n\nNot to mention a mouth, that self proclaims it's wise\n\nRunning toward the same road, you've done this all before\n\nThen jump back into your own lie, girl who's this really for?\n\n\n\nI'm praying that I'm wrong\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\nYou can't, so get gone\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\n\n\nWhat do you take me for?\n\nI'm not the fool you saw\n\nHow can you be so sure?\n\nWhat do you take me for\n\n\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\n(Tell me)\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\n(Tell me)\n\nYou can't, so get gone\n\n(Tell me)\n\nTell me that I'm wrong\n\n(Tell me)",
