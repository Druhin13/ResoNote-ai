  "lyrics": "Spent a week at sunset tower\r\nMade a mess upon the kitchen counter\r\nOur intentions were simple\r\nNow our intentions are simple\r\nYou only love me under pressure\r\nYou're only half of me in colder weather\n\nOnly tell me it's over just to get back together\n\n\n\nI can't stop coming back for closure\n\nNo, I can't stop\n\n\n\nI try to break all your spells\n\nPut my hands on someone else\n\nBut you keep sinking my ship\n\nI keep on losing my grip\n\nCan't put you back on a shelf\n\nCan't keep my hands to myself\n\nOnce you start moving your hips\n\nI keep on losing my grip, every time\n\n(Every time)\n\n\n\nI can hold you like a matchstick\n\nWatch the flame until it's burning my skin\n\nMaybe I should know better\n\nBut you're my guilty pleasure\n\n\n\nI can't stop coming back for closure\n\nNo, I can't stop\n\n\n\nI try to break all your spells\n\nPut my hands on someone else\n\nBut you keep sinking my ship\n\nI keep on losing my grip\n\nCan't put you back on a shelf\n\nCan't keep my hands to myself\n\nOnce you start moving your hips\n\nI keep on losing my grip, every time\n\n\n\n(Towers, every time, I can't stop thinking 'bout you\n\nTowers, every time, I can't stop thinking 'bout you)\n\n\n\nI try to break all your spells\n\nPut my hands on someone else\n\nBut you keep sinking my ship\n\nI keep on losing my grip\n\nCan't put you back on a shelf\n\nCan't keep my hands to myself\n\nOnce you start moving your hips\n\nI keep on losing my grip, every time\n\n(Every time)",
