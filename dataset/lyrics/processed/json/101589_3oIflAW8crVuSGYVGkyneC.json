  "lyrics": "We dive into the blue\r\nI can't hold onto you\r\nStaring the illusion in the eye\r\nAnd when the colors blur\r\nWe forget who we were\r\nAnd all we need is technicolor\n\n\n\nAnd I lost my grip\n\nAnd all we need is technicolor\n\nI give into it\n\n\n\nWe were in love\n\nWe were in love\n\nOh, we were in love\n\nWe were in love\n\nAnd all we need is technicolor\n\n\n\nWe dip into the pool\n\nCold water covers you\n\nIt's draining all the color from your eyes\n\nAnd as we start to fade\n\nYour lips they turn to grey\n\nWhen all we need is technicolor\n\n\n\nAnd I know my lack of love will drown itself\n\nAnd I know I cannot keep what wasn't found\n\n'Cause the fire's out that used to burn in me\n\nClose your eyes to see what's really happening\n\n\n\nWe were in love\n\nWe were in love\n\nOh, we were in love\n\nOh, we were in love\n\nAnd all we need is technicolor\n\nAnd all we need is technicolor\n\nAnd all we need is technicolor",
