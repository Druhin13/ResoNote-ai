  "lyrics": "I feel, I feel the ending\r\nBefore it even starts\r\nMy jacket's under the table\r\nYour sneakers are right where they usually are\r\nWe're a touch away from naked\r\nOne touch from never changing\n\nYeah, we know we shouldn't but\n\nWe're always letting us down\n\nSo two steps on the carpet\n\nIn your studio apartment\n\nYeah, we know we shouldn't curse\n\n\n\nWe go from heart, heart\n\nJust let me shut the doors till they crack\n\nWe go from love, love\n\nTo saying shit that we can't take back\n\nBut every time that we walk out\n\nWe just keep coming back\n\nLike we forget to forget\n\nForget to forget about us\n\nEach time, time\n\nPromise this time will be the last\n\n'Cause we both know\n\nIt's a mistake waking up in this bed\n\nBut every time that we walk out\n\nWe just keep coming back\n\nLike we forget to forget\n\nForget to forget about us\n\n\n\nI know, I know this bedroom\n\nBetter than I know mine\n\nYour boyhood still in the wardrobe\n\nYou hid it away like you usually do\n\nWe're a touch away from naked\n\nOne touch from never changing\n\nYeah, we know we shouldn't but\n\nWe're always letting us down\n\nSo two steps on the carpet\n\nIn your studio apartment\n\nYeah, we know we shouldn't curse\n\n\n\nWe go from heart, heart\n\nJust let me shut the doors till they crack\n\nWe go from love, love\n\nTo saying shit that we can't take back\n\nBut every time that we walk out\n\nWe just keep coming back\n\nLike we forget to forget\n\nForget to forget about us\n\nEach time, time\n\nPromise this time will be the last\n\n'Cause we both know\n\nIt's a mistake waking up in this bed\n\nBut every time that we walk out\n\nWe just keep coming back\n\nLike we forget to forget\n\nForget to forget about us\n\n\n\nI feel, I feel the ending\n\nBefore it even starts",
