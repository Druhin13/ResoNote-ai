They had to make some changes\r\nThree broads will burn us, these dames could gets dangerous\n\nDude you never see will forever remain nameless\n\nTwo of them things black, the last one's stainless\n\nDon't deal with the devil on a deep level\n\nThey see metal and sound off like a tea kettle\n\nBlow the spot up lovely\n\nWith no reference to skin color, God don't like ugly\n\nWise man once said not to showboat\n\nAnd treat the yacht the same way as a rowboat\n\nThe snakes'll hang theyself with they own rope\n\nAnd watch a jewel transform to a known quote\n\n\n\nAll I'm tryna do is just make mine\n\nWhy a sideline rider and tryna take mine?\n\n'Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time\n\nPuttin' facts to the claps and the bassline\n\nAll I'm tryna do is just make mine\n\nWhy a sideline rider and tryna take mine?\n\n'Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time\n\nPuttin' facts to the claps and the bassline\n\n\n\nIt's Mary Poppin' y'all, shout to Michael Rooker\n\nYou with a mic is like a eunuch with a hooker\n\nPressure (pressure pressure) cooker\n\nMy confusion's organize, I'm the lord of light\n\nYandu with an arrow's like Eso with the cordless mic\n\nFlow holy, no gospel trap, writin' like\n\nMichael Crichton put the rap in Velocirap-tor, or\n\nI hit you like a trap-door, when it rains it pours\n\nNo mental strains, but I stick out like Kurt Angle's temple veins\n\nYou got an empty brain, enter in my lane\n\nIt takes balls like a gender change, people talkin' out they ass\n\nCheck for the double-cross like 2Chainz at Sunday mass\n\nHit you with the belly to belly, the suplex\n\nOff the roof of the duplex, willin' to group text\n\nWith Steely Dan, Groot, fuckin' baby Groot\n\nThe ghost of Dave Brubeck, Alex Trebek, and Boba Fett, who's next?\n\n\n\nAll I'm tryna do is just make mine\n\nWhy a sideline rider and tryna take mine?\n\n'Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time\n\nPuttin' facts to the claps and the bassline\n\nAll I'm tryna do is just make mine\n\nWhy a sideline rider and tryna take mine?\n\n'Cause I shine like the sun, broad day time\n\nPuttin' facts to the claps and the bassline",
