  "lyrics": "He says he sells an escape\r\nWith an hour forty of projected scripted goodness\r\nA brand new moral revelation\r\nFor anyone who's hungry\r\nTo believe it, eat it\n\nMy lungs are so tired\n\nSo sick of always sighing\n\nMy posters, my CDs\n\nAre breaking my heart\n\nWhen they shouldn't be\n\n\n\nAnd to think he wore his cape\n\nTill he had to leave\n\nAnd oh, all these villains play the heroes on TV\n\n\n\nAll these perverts in my headphones\n\nTalk to me when I was young\n\nAnd listening to them\n\nNow their prose sounds clumsy\n\nLike they're trying to be anything but honest often\n\n\n\nMy lungs are so tired\n\nSo sick of always sighing\n\nMy posters, my CDs\n\nAre breaking my heart\n\nWhen they shouldn't be\n\n\n\nAnd to think he wore his cape\n\nTill he had to leave\n\nAnd oh, all these villains play the heroes on TV\n\n\n\nNo trust for the song of the Summer, baby\n\nNo trust for the song of the Spring\n\nThe tune is stuck in my head\n\nBut now I can't just get it to leave\n\n\n\nOh, what a horrible feeling listening\n\nOh, to someone who does nothing",
