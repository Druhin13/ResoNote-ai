  "lyrics": "I was eighteen when we first met\r\nCouldn't believe how you took my breath\r\nIn your sweatshirt, your converse\r\nYou didn't even know you were rockin' my world\r\nSittin' in line, tryin' to get a coffee\n\nStealin' looks, you turned around and caught me\n\nI laughed, and you smiled\n\nAnd we took a chance to stay for a while\n\n\n\nOh-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\nI never saw you comin'\n\nOh-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\nBut I had to say somethin'\n\n\n\nHello beautiful, I've never seen you before\n\nDo you live 'round here, what's your name beautiful?\n\nThe way you looked at me, girl it took my breath away\n\nAnd I had to introduce myself, I just had to say\n\n\n\nHello beautiful, beautiful, whoa-oo-whoa\n\nHello beautiful, beautiful, whoa-oo-whoa\n\n\n\nI got your name, and I got your number\n\nWe sat for hours, talkin' to each other\n\nBut one night, just wasn't enough\n\nWe were all in, fallin' in love\n\n\n\nI tried to see you but your daddy wouldn't let me\n\nHe told you, you should just forget me\n\nBut what we had, was somethin' so real and he\n\nHe didn't know, the way we feel\n\n\n\nOh-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\nAnd so I met you in the dark\n\nOh-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\nUnderneath the stars\n\n\n\nHello beautiful, it's good to see you again\n\nI'm glad you found your way down to this riverbend\n\nI know we don't have long, but I'll take what I can get\n\nEvery moment spent with you is worth the consequence\n\n\n\nHello beautiful, beautiful, whoa-oo-whoa\n\nHello beautiful, beautiful, whoa-oo-whoa\n\n\n\nAnd I remember when you called me\n\nSomething in your voice had changed\n\nYou told me you were moving with your dad to another state\n\nI'm still waiting by this riverbend\n\nYeah I come here everyday\n\n\n\nWaiting for that moment when you find your way\n\nBack to me, and I'll say\n\n\n\nHello beautiful\n\nHello beautiful",
