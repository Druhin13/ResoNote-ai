  "lyrics": "The magic is black, backyard happy and fertile\r\nFor Kasso, the Acid King of the Black Circle\r\nSame year Bowie dropped\r\nTwo horns hatched and matured to gore Northport's '84\r\nHere is '84: Mary Lou Retton, Excitebike, AIDS, Jeopardy!\r\nWake up the Orwell in me\n\nCrack rock, anyway: seventeen summers in developing\n\nWould it be the middle school or ketamine? Guess\n\nLeft home in the dark\n\nTo curl up in a bear hug in Suffolk County's arms\n\nWith a bevy of heavy metal records and leather bibles\n\nMore Anton LaVey than Saint Michael\n\nMore sherm in a Ford on bricks behind Midas\n\nFly with the pentagram pilot\n\nSabbath and Judas and all tunes prudent\n\nSeems tame now, but then it was Devil music\n\nRick Six, the nickname clicks\n\nMakeshift altar in a clearing in the sticks\n\nForfeit a kitten by the forks from the kitchen\n\nWith horsemen who drew the same symbols\n\nPitchforks waving out a grand theft four by four support system\n\nAlas; Angus on the ax in the back\n\nForeground offering a pitch-dark animal corpse\n\nAnd backyard black mass\n\nAnd a brash curiosity opt for grave robbery\n\nTo puff and pluck skulls at a cemetery property\n\nCops cuff him and stuff him in Amityville Asylum\n\nIt's fantasy island for Noah's Lions, at the time\n\nSouth Oaks, but focus on the environment\n\nAnd how it couldn't loosen the Lucifer out his client\n\nWho would flee\n\nPale moon, pale horse howling death\n\nAnd LSD to make it mean more than it meant\n\nPay attention: here's where the whole thing sours\n\nAnd goes from intrigue into wowzers\n\nAt a party, a passed out drunk Kasso gets got for 10 bags of dust\n\nNow it's not a big town, and people are big mouths\n\nSo he fishes around 'til he figures it out\n\nGary Lauwers, seventeen years young\n\nYou have no idea what you've done\n\nTrack him down, beat him pissy\n\nHe got five bags back, still owes him fifty\n\nOh Ricky, Ricky, do we hound him for loot?\n\nR show him how the hellbound do? Hmm...\n\nKasso waives all debts\n\nSays \"Let's just go and get baked instead\"\n\nTwo shake hands and the beef play dead\n\nThough it's more like a skeeter shaking a web\n\nAnd along came a spider with two of his friends\n\nIt was into the woods, a delusional mess\n\nFour kids dipped in a black hole bath\n\nJune 16, Kasso snaps\n\nOff-guard Gary tackled and pinned\n\nSees Rick pull a knife from his jacket and grin\n\nRaise that knife like a sword to the moon\n\nPlunge that knife through a portrait of youth, going\n\n\"Say you love Satan, say you love Satan\"\n\nLauwers ain't say it, just cave to the facelift\n\nThirty-two stab wounds, gouged out eyes\n\nBurns on his skin, not a cloud in the sky\n\nKasso had later explained he was told\n\nBy Satan himself in the form of a crow\n\nTo murder the kid cold, a part of a pristine whole\n\nNo, no, no, no, no\n\nAnd just had to brag\n\nUntil somebody sad just had to rat\n\nSat in the cell is a merchant of hate\n\nWho would hang from his sheet before the third day\n\nSome say Kasso was part of a cult\n\nBut I'm sure there was more than we're told\n\nMore than adults and authority could rightly decode\n\nOr maybe I'm wrong and he's finally home\n\nKasso!\n\n\n\nIt's starting to feel like a nice night\n\nHold close to the highs and the white light\n\nHold close to the good you are drawn to\n\nThese woods were grown to disarm you\n\nIt's starting to feel like a nice night\n\nHold close to the highs and the white light\n\nHold close to the good you are drawn to\n\nThese woods were grown to disarm you\n\nIt's starting to feel like a nice night\n\nHold close to the highs and the white light\n\nHold close to the good you are drawn to\n\nThese woods were grown to disarm you\n\nIt's starting to feel like a nice night\n\nHold close to the highs and the white light\n\nHold close to the good you are drawn to\n\nThese woods were grown to disarm you",
