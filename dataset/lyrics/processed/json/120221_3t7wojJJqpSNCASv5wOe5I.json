  "lyrics": "By the pool, there's a lot of pretty girls\r\nBut all I see is you\r\nLaying down, taking up all of the sun\r\nSave some for me\r\nI know there's more layers to rip up off you\r\nGrab a towel and meet me in the house\n\nDripping chocolate all over the bedroom\n\nDrowning in your softly spoken sounds\n\n\n\nI can't live without my brown\n\nFills me up with just the right amount\n\nEasy on the soul, my brown\n\nWrap me in between, I want it now\n\nEverybody love that cocoa brown\n\n\n\nGrab my keys, you'll take the wheel\n\nI keep it cool I've not felt like this before\n\nI get my cash from out your chest\n\nIt's safe with you\n\nOoh, I like it how you try to hold back\n\nBut that don't last long\n\nWe driving too fast right past all the milestones\n\n\n\nPulled up on my pressure treated driveway\n\nTouching 'fore we made it through the door\n\nRaced you to my room, ran up the staircase\n\nOpposite of you waits on the floor\n\nNo need for more\n\n\n\nI can't live without my brown\n\nFills me up with just the right amount\n\nEasy on the soul, my brown\n\nWrap me in between, I want it now\n\nEverybody love that cocoa brown\n\nOh, baby",
