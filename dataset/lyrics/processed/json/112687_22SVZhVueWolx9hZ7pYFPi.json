  "lyrics": "O holy night, the stars are brightly shining\r\nIt is the night of the dear Savior's birth\r\nO holy night, the fire is slowly dying\r\nAnd here we lay on the snow covered earth\r\nHear the angels sing from up high\n\nOh night divine, please be mine\n\n\n\nOh night when Christ was born\n\nOh\n\nOh night when Christ was born\n\n\n\nO holy night, the moonlight guides His own words\n\nAlong the road to the manger He lays\n\nO holy night, the silence only wanders\n\nHe walks alone down the snow covered lanes\n\n\n\nHear the angels sing from up high\n\nOh night divine, please be mine\n\nHear the angels sing from up high\n\nHear their voices ring from the height\n\nOh night divine, please be mine\n\n\n\nOh night when Christ was born\n\nOh\n\nOh night when Christ was born\n\n\n\nHear the angels sing from up high\n\nOh night divine, please be mine\n\nHear their voices ring from the height\n\nOh night divine, please be mine",
