  "lyrics": "If I died today, would you carry on\r\nA promise to be made while we are still young\r\nBefore the shadows break and brings what lies beyond\r\nBefore the last refrain, before the moment’s gone\r\nWhen the songbird sings tonight\n\nI hope you remember\n\nLa vie tunnel never dies\n\nIt will go on forever\n\n\n\nNot so much has changed, the battle’s never far\n\nThe dark is laying waste to everything you are\n\nI know you’re terrified in the wreckage of the storm\n\nLet the melody inside\n\nLet its boundless coil unwind and make you whole\n\n\n\nWhen the songbird sings tonight\n\nI hope you remember\n\nLa vie tunnel never dies\n\nIt will go on forever\n\n\n\nKnow what I leave behind is etched among the stars\n\nSo you know\n\nAll rhythm and rhyme, the cadence of my heart\n\nWhen you know\n\nA promise you will find, no matter where you are\n\nNo matter where you are\n\n\n\nWhen the songbird sings tonight\n\nI hope you remember\n\nLa vie tunnel never dies\n\nIt will go on forever\n\n\n\nWhen the songbird sings tonight\n\nMay you finally surrender\n\nTo the guilt I leave behind\n\nIt’s a song within my heart\n\nWithin my heart",
