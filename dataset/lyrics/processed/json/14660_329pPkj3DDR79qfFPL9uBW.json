  "lyrics": "Eh\r\nEh-eh, eh-eh (hmm)\r\nSinging songs to friendship\r\nI feel the ocean dew on my lip\r\nSitting 'round the fire\n\nI feel the heat of your desire\n\n\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one?\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one?\n\n\n\nEh\n\nEh-eh, eh-eh\n\n\n\nLiving just to live\n\nStill in bits from your puppet's fridge\n\nTalk about the tension\n\nI wanna do things that you couldn't mention\n\n\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one? (Last one)\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one? (Last one)\n\n\n\nEh\n\nEh-eh, eh-eh\n\n\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one? (Last one)\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one? (Last one)\n\n\n\n(Last one, last one, last one)\n\n\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one?\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one?\n\nWhat good would it do\n\nTo have another summer like last one?",
