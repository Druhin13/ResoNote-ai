  "title": "Dry Your Eyes",
  "lyrics": "Dry your eyes and take your song out\r\nIt's a newborn afternoon\r\nAnd if you can't recall the singer\r\nYou can still recall the tune\r\nDry your eyes and play it slowly\n\nLike you're marching off to war\n\nSing it like you know he'd want it\n\nLike we sang it once before\n\n\n\nAnd from the center of the circle\n\nTo the midst of the waiting crowd\n\nIf it ever be forgotten\n\nSing it long and sing it loud\n\nAnd come dry your eyes\n\n\n\nAnd it taught us more about giving\n\nThan we ever cared to know\n\nBut we came to find the secret\n\nAnd we never let it go\n\n\n\nAnd it was more than being holy\n\nOh it was less than being free\n\nAnd if you can't recall the reason\n\nCan you hear the people sing\n\n\n\nRight through the lightning and the thunder\n\nTo the dark side of the moon\n\nTo that distant falling angel\n\nThat descended much too soon\n\nAnd come dry your eyes\n\n\n\nCome dry your eyes",
