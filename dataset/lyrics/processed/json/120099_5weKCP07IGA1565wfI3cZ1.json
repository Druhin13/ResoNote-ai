  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Happier par Ed Sheeran\r\nWalking down 29th and park\nI saw you in another's arm\nOnly a month we've been apart\nYou look happier\nSaw you walk inside a bar\nHe said something to make you laugh\nI saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours\nYeah, you look happier, you do\n\nAin't nobody hurt you like I hurt you\nBut ain't nobody love you like I do\nPromise that I will not take it personal, baby\nIf you're moving on with someone new\n\n'Cause baby you look happier, you do\n\nMy friends told me one day I'll feel it too\nAnd until then I'll smile to hide the truth\nBut I know I was happier with you\n\nSat on the corner of the room\nEverything's reminding me of you\nNursing an empty bottle and telling myself\nYou're happier, aren't you?\n\nOh, Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you\nBut ain't nobody need you like I do\nI know that there's others that deserve you\nBut my darling, I am still in love with you\n\nBut I guess you look happier, you do\nMy friends told me one day I'll feel it too\nI could try to smile to hide the truth\nBut I know I was happier with you\n\nBaby, you look happier, you do\nI knew one day you'd fall for someone new\nBut if he breaks your heart like lovers do\nJust know that I'll be waiting here for you",
