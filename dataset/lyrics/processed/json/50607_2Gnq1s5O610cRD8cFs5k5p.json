  "lyrics": "People tell me, sell me potions, notions\r\nOf success and fortune\r\nWho are they to tell me\r\nWho are they to tell me\r\nI could fake it, just to make it\r\nGive a promise, just to break it\n\n\n\nWho are they to tell me\n\nMaybe if I only gave away\n\nThe part of me, heart of me\n\nJust enough to start something\n\nAin't nothing, keep judging\n\n\n\nI won't compromise (I won't)\n\nI won't say goodbye (I won't)\n\nDreams I've had since I was five\n\nYou can never make me\n\nI won't compromise (I won't)\n\nI won't apologize. (I won't)\n\nDon't care if you're satisfied\n\nNever gonna change me\n\n\n\nThey all roll their eyes and try to shut me\n\nCut me down to size\n\nBut trust me, they don't even know me, they don't even know me\n\nI don't need to justify\n\nThe way I live my life is mine\n\nSo who are you to tell me, who are you to tell me\n\n\n\nI owe you the part of me, heart of me\n\nJust enough to start something\n\nAin't nothing? Keep judging\n\n\n\nI won't compromise (I won't)\n\nI won't say goodbye (I won't)\n\nDreams I've had since I was five\n\nYou can never make me\n\nI won't compromise (I won't)\n\nI won't apologize. (I won't)\n\nI don't care if you're satisfied\n\nNever gonna change me\n\n\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNo no no no no\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nI won't compromise, no\n\nI won't compromise\n\nI won't compromise, no\n\nHey yeah(I won't)\n\nAll right\n\nI won't compromise, No\n\n\n\nI won't compromise (I won't)\n\nI won't say goodbye (I won't)\n\nDreams I've had since I was five\n\nYou can never make me\n\nI won't compromise (I won't)\n\nI won't apologize. (I won't)\n\nI don't care if you're satisfied\n\nNever gonna change me\n\n\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nNo no no no no\n\nNever gonna change me\n\nYou're never gonna change me\n\nI won't compromise, no",
