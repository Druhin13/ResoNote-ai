  "lyrics": "The treetops, the chimneys, the snowbed stories, winter grey\r\nWildflowers, those meadows of heaven, wind in the wheat\r\nA railroad across waters, the scent of grandfatherly love\r\nBlue bayous, Decembers, moon through a dragonfly's wings\n\nWhere is the wonder where's the awe\n\nWhere's dear Alice knocking on the door\n\nWhere's the trapdoor that takes me there\n\nWhere's the real is shattered by a Mad Marsh Hare\n\n\n\nWhere is the wonder where's the awe\n\nWhere are the sleepless nights I used to live for\n\nBefore the years take me\n\nI wish to see\n\nThe lost in me\n\n\n\nI want my tears back\n\nI want my tears back now\n\n\n\nA ballet on a grove, still growing young all alone\n\nA rag doll, a best friend, the voice of Mary Costa\n\n\n\n(Grazie a silenced per questo testo)",
