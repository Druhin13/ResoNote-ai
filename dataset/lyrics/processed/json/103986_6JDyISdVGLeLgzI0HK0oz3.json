  "lyrics": "Friday night and no one's home\r\nThere's no point in getting drunk alone\r\nGrab your coat and make a call\r\nI'll meet you down in temple bar\r\nPeople come and people go\r\nSo raise a glass to who you know\n\nWhen winter hasn't taken hold\n\nSo why do I feel so cold\n\n\n\nLike a question without an answer\n\nLike music without its dancers\n\nLike a bird without a song\n\nTell me where did it all go wrong\n\nLike a frame without a picture\n\nLike God without a scripture\n\nLike me when I know you're gone\n\nTell me where did it all go wrong\n\n\n\nOh where did it all go wrong, go wrong\n\nOh when did it all go wrong, go wrong\n\n\n\nSaw a girl that I used to know\n\nIt's funny how the hearts moves on\n\nShe's got her home and a family\n\nI gett the feeling she's forgotten me\n\nPeople leave their mark and go\n\nLike ootprints in the winter snow\n\nWhen winter hasn't taken hold\n\nSo why do I feel so cold\n\n\n\nLike a question without an answer\n\nLike music without its dancers\n\nLike a bird without a song\n\nTell me where did it all go wrong\n\nLike a frame without a picture\n\nLike God without a scripture\n\nLike me when I know you're gone\n\nTell me where did it all go wrong\n\n\n\nOh where did it all go wrong, go wrong\n\nOh when did it all go wrong, go wrong\n\n\n\nLike a question without an answer\n\nLike music without its dancers\n\nLike a bird without a song\n\nTell me where did it all go wrong\n\nLike a frame without a picture\n\nLike God without a scripture\n\nLike me when I know you're gone\n\nTell me where did it all go wrong\n\n\n\nOh where did it all go wrong, go wrong\n\nOh when did it all go wrong, go wrong",
