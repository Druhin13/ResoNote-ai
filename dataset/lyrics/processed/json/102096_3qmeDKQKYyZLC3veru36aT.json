  "lyrics": "Some people stay all alone and hide\r\nThey don't even want to know the reason why\r\nThey've given up on finding someone new\r\nBut new love comes, it's gonna come for you\r\nWhen true love comes, it's gonna comfort you\n\nNow you say you've got a broken heart\n\nYou oughta know this side of love can leave you torn apart\n\nDry your eyes 'cause your heart's gonna mend\n\nAnd maybe tonight you'll fall in love again\n\nYeah, maybe tonight you'l fall in love again\n\n\n\nBut I know, I know that you're down on love\n\nBut you're wrong, so wrong\n\nTo be down on love\n\n\n\nNow love seems so far away\n\nYour skies are so cloudy\n\nAnd the tears come like fallin' rain\n\nFace up to it and don't pretend\n\nAnd maybe tonight you'll fall in love again\n\nYeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again\n\nJust once in a life you'll realize\n\nWhen love takes two, only one heart cries\n\n\n\nBut you're wrong, so wrong to be down on love\n\nYou know you're not the only one\n\nSee I've been down on love\n\n\n\nIn matters of the heart\n\nYou better know before you start\n\nYou can't get down on love\n\n\n\nSo always be prepared\n\nTo be alone and a little scared\n\nBut never down on love\n\n\n\nYou see you can't stay down forever, girl\n\nDown on love\n\nCome on, now\n\nDon't get down on love\n\nThis ain't right baby, no\n\nDown on love\n\nDon't you go through life livin' down on love\n\nDown on love\n\nDon't you go through life livin' down on love\n\nDown on love\n\nDon't you go through life down on love\n\nDown on love\n\nDown on love",
