  "lyrics": "Say what's on your mind\r\nBut don't say what you can't take back\r\n'Cause we're both broken-hearted\r\nAnd lately we've been feeling like crap\r\nThis ain't no competition\r\nIf you want it that way, we can do it that way, now\n\nThe truth is there's no winner when you hurt somebody like that\n\n\n\nWhen the party's over I'm still here with you\n\nAnd tonight we are sober, looking at you\n\nI'm saying this sober, I can't be with you right now\n\nI know we got a million reasons why\n\nWe shouldn't be around each other right now\n\nBut when I find the one, the one reason why\n\nFeels like I got a million reasons\n\nI can't let go\n\n\n\nI'm sorry, please forgive me\n\nFor keep on pulling it back every time you're leaving\n\nAnd I'm sorry, I can't help it\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons\n\n\n\nIt's hard to make sense\n\nWhen your heart is messing with your head\n\nI think we both know that we need to put this love to bed\n\nIt's like we keep forgetting\n\nI should stay away from, you should stay away right now\n\nI guess it's complicated when you want something that you can't have\n\n\n\nWhen the party's over I'm still here with you\n\nAnd tonight we are sober, looking at you\n\nI'm saying this sober, I can't be with you right now\n\nI know we got a million reasons why\n\nWe shouldn't be around each other right now\n\nBut when I find the one, the one reason why\n\nFeels like I got a million reasons\n\nI can't let go\n\n\n\nI'm sorry (Sorry), please forgive me (Forgive me)\n\nFor keep on pulling it back every time you're leaving\n\nAnd I'm sorry (Sorry), I can't help it\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons why\n\nI can't help it\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons\n\nI can't help it\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons\n\n\n\nI don't know (I don't know)\n\nWhere we'll go (Where we'll go)\n\nBut right now (But right now)\n\nIt's all good (It's all good)\n\nIt's all good (It's all good)\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nI'm sorry (Sorry), please forgive me (Forgive me)\n\nFor keep on pulling it back every time you're leaving\n\nAnd I'm sorry (Sorry), I can't help it\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons why\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons why\n\nI can't help it\n\nYou give me a million reasons, million reasons",
