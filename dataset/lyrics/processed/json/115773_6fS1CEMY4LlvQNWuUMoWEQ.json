  "lyrics": "Pretty wings, you’re the prettiest thing\r\nYou’re like Parker Posey in a magazine\r\nWith fitted jeans and crop top back in ninety-three\r\nI wanna be your dressed in black\r\nYour dark star on the backwards hat\r\nI’m gonna write a book and put your name on every page\n\nEvery page\n\n\n\nHey pretty little mockingbird\n\nKeep singing them sad, sad songs\n\nThere’s already rain on my window\n\nI’m dying when the morning comes\n\nFlew away in the night with the raven\n\nNow I’m underneath the willows hanging\n\nI’m too strung out to be upside down\n\nPretty little mockingbird, sing your song\n\n\n\nI was desert, honey you were the sand\n\nI was a bird, baby you were the branch\n\nAnd I flew into the blue and watched those flowers die\n\nIt wasn't much, just everything\n\nYou could've sat right there and got high with me\n\nBut you fell asleep and your dreaming brought the nightmares\n\nBrought the nightmares\n\n\n\nHey pretty little mockingbird\n\nKeep singing them sad, sad songs\n\nThere’s already rain on my window\n\nI’m dying when the morning comes\n\nFlew away in the night with the raven\n\nNow I’m underneath the willows hanging\n\nI’m too strung out to be upside down\n\nPretty little mockingbird, sing your song\n\n\n\n\n\nHey pretty little mockingbird\n\nKeep singing them sad, sad songs\n\nThere’s already rain on my window\n\nI’m dying when the morning comes\n\nFlew away in the night with the raven\n\nNow I’m underneath the willows hanging\n\nI’m too strung out to be upside down\n\nPretty little mockingbird\n\nPretty little mockingbird, sing your song",
