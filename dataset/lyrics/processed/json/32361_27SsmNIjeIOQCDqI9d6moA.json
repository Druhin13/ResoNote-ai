  "lyrics": "Silver ridge bends in the dead of night\r\nI can drive this street with my eyes closed\r\nCount the windows just to see the light\r\nWill I lose my mind if I let this go?\r\nNow your love never lets me down\n\nIn my dreams, I've got my feet on the ground\n\nAnd when we're lost in the lights downtown\n\nYou can look up\n\nThe stars always love you, and I'm all in\n\n\n\nIt was touch and go for the longest time\n\nInside you know I'm still confused\n\nWhen you said there's nothing left to hide\n\nIf I beg borrow now, we'll never lose\n\n\n\nAnd now your love never lets me down\n\nIn my dreams, I've got my feet on the ground\n\nAnd when we're lost in the lights downtown\n\nAnd you can look up\n\nStars always love you\n\nI'll never love again\n\nI'll never love again\n\nI'll never love again\n\n\n\n\n\nNow your love never lets me down\n\nIn my dreams, I've got my feet on the ground\n\nAnd when we're lost in the lights downtown\n\nAnd you can look up\n\nWhen it's love\n\nWhen it's love",
