  "lyrics": "Late night talking\r\nStaying up way past the twilight\r\nInside this place we call our home\r\nThis place we call our home\r\nPainting futures inside our heads\n\nAs we go through pictures\n\nThat make us who we are\n\nThat make us who we are\n\n\n\nAnd I don't wanna lose this feeling\n\nI just wanna stay with you right here\n\n\n\nIf we're just pieces of a puzzle that's unfinished\n\nJust chapters of a story that's unwritten\n\nIf we're pixels in an image of the future\n\nWhat a beautiful picture\n\n\n\nEarly driving, windows rolled down\n\nWith the sunlight climbing\n\nWe could see our whole lives\n\nIs this what heaven's like?\n\n\n\nAnd I don't wanna lose this feeling\n\nI just wanna stay with you right here\n\n\n\nIf we're just pieces of a puzzle that's unfinished\n\nJust chapters of a story that's unwritten\n\nIf we're pixels in an image of the future\n\n\n\nIf life is just a breath and love is more than chances\n\nDon't be afraid to live, don't be afraid to live\n\nIf life is just a breath and love is more than chances\n\nDon't be afraid to live, don't be afraid to live\n\n\n\nLate night talking\n\nStaying up way past the twilight\n\nInside this place we call our home\n\n\n\nIf we're just pieces of a puzzle that's unfinished\n\nJust passengers of the time that we've been giving\n\nIf we're pixels in an image of the future",
