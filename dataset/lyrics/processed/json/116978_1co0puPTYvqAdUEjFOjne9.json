  "lyrics": "The way your fingers fit in mine\r\nIt's five plus five, not rocket science\r\nThis day in time, that's hard to find, it's true.\r\nThe road we're on ain't a traffic jam\r\nIt's a Sunday drive on a piece of land\r\nIt's paradise as long as I'm with you\n\n\n\nIt's like one, two, three\n\nJust as easy as can be\n\nJust the way you look at me\n\nYou make me smile\n\nAin't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated\n\nWe've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\n\n\nWe used to live on Instagram\n\nWorry 'bout who all gives a damn\n\n'Bout where we've been and where we ended up\n\nThen I met you and you met me\n\nAnd all the rest is history\n\nAn epiphany that all we need is us\n\n\n\nIt's like one, two, three\n\nJust as easy as can be\n\nJust the way you look at me\n\nYou make me smile\n\nAin't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated\n\nWe've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style\n\nWe're just simple like a six string\n\nThe way this world was meant to be\n\nLike laughin' love, make a lot out of a little\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\n\n\n\n\nAin't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated\n\nWe've been there, it's safe to say it ain't our style yeah\n\nIt's like one, two, three\n\nJust as easy as can be\n\nJust the way you look at me\n\nYou make me smile\n\nAin't no need to complicate it, we both know that's overrated\n\nWe've been there, its safe to say it ain't our style\n\nWe're just simple like a six string\n\nThe way this world was meant to be\n\nLike laughin' love, make a lot out of a little\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be\n\nIt's just that simple, S-I-M-P-L-E\n\nSimple as can be",
