  "lyrics": "Every day I'm just surviving\r\nKeep climbing the mountain\r\nEven when I feel like dying\r\nKeep climbing the mountain\r\nAnother night I'm barely holding on\n\nOne step away from being dead and gone\n\nIn my life to die another day\n\nIs this life that I've been living?\n\nAll that's meant for me?\n\n\n\nEvery day I'm just surviving\n\nKeep climbing the mountain\n\nEven when I feel like dying\n\nKeep climbing the mountain\n\n\n\nEvery time I think I'm over it\n\nI wake up in the bottom of it all again\n\nI'm still surviving\n\nKeep climbing, keep climbing\n\nThe mountain\n\n\n\nThe higher I go the harder I fall\n\nSo I don't look down, I don't look back at all\n\nAnd when I wish it all would turn to black\n\nI try to see the light and push the darkness back\n\n\n\nEvery day I'm just surviving\n\nKeep climbing the mountain\n\nEven when I feel like dying\n\nKeep climbing the mountain\n\n\n\nEvery time I think I'm over it\n\nI wake up in the bottom of it all again\n\nI'm still surviving\n\nI keep climbing, I keep climbing\n\nThe mountain\n\n\n\nSo if I'm not already too far gone\n\nAnd if I feel a pulse, I can carry on\n\nWhen I'm lost and want to fade away\n\nI tell myself to live to die another day\n\n\n\nEvery day I'm just surviving\n\nKeep climbing the mountain\n\nEven when I feel like dying\n\nKeep climbing the mountain\n\n\n\nEvery time I think I'm over it\n\nI wake up in the bottom of it all again\n\nI'm still aliving\n\nKeep climbing, keep climbing\n\nThe mountain",
