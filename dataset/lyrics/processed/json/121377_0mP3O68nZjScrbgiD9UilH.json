  "lyrics": "It begins with them, but ends with me. Their son, Vaxus.\r\nHere, emotions behold\r\nYou've entered a Hell where the Devil is made of gold\r\nPlease, don't run your mouth\r\nThe questions before have no place in this haunted house\n\nReveal your selfish pleasure\n\nOne more time run for good measure\n\nIn the answer you hold\n\nTime would be better off if our souls had been sold\n\n\n\nHere where the light only dies to remember\n\nIn a place where the blind truly can see\n\nHear my voice dearly departed\n\nI beg on my knees\n\nIt's been my pleasure\n\nTo serve your disease\n\n\n\nWelcome home\n\nShed your skin and expose your bones\n\nTake my hand\n\nAnd follow us into the black\n\nSo far that we can't get back\n\n\n\nHere, dig me a grave\n\nAnd toss in the lives that you can't be bothered to save\n\nWith their blood on your hands\n\nYou enjoy the sun while you shit in the purest sand\n\nKiss your lover with that filthy mouth you fucking monster\n\nHere as evil now gropes\n\nIt's caught us off guard with its hand reaching for our throats\n\n\n\nHere where the light only dies to remember\n\nIn a place where the blind truly can see\n\nHear my voice dearly departed\n\nI beg on my knees\n\nIt's been my pleasure\n\nTo serve your disease\n\n\n\nWelcome home\n\nShed your skin and expose your bones\n\nTake my hand\n\nAnd follow us into the black\n\nSo far that we can't get back\n\n\n\nThere's no telling when the truth is clear\n\nPay it no mind\n\nLines were drawn for us\n\nFor all sides\n\nIn the afterglow\n\nEchoes of time unfold\n\nGive me your word my dear\n\nAnd promise you won't let go\n\n\n\nIt's a shame I fear\n\nFor men to start\n\nWe walk their lines\n\nAll to play the fucking part\n\nShame I fear\n\nFor men to start\n\nWe walk their lines\n\nAll to play the fucking part\n\n\n\nI fear we've got all we had wanted\n\nClose your eyes and believe it didn't happen\n\nNow shut your mouth beyond your lies\n\nThe world knows to stay away from you\n\nIn the blood you let run\n\nThey march as you lead\n\nWe laugh in the sun\n\nMaybe that's all we need\n\nI, and I, and I'm sorry\n\nYou can't escape\n\n\n\nHere where the light only dies to remember\n\nIn a place where the blind truly can see\n\nHear my voice dearly departed\n\nI beg on my knees\n\nIt's been my pleasure\n\nTo serve your disease\n\n\n\nWelcome home\n\nShed your skin and expose your bones\n\nTake my hand\n\nAnd follow us into the black\n\nSo far that we can't get back\n\n\n\nWelcome home\n\n\n\nWelcome home",
