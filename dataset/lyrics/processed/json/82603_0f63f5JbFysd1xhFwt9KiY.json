  "lyrics": "We teach them to pretend\r\nNot to break the line\r\nTo always look away\r\nAnd never ask why\r\nWe sit beside the cradle\n\nWe tell them to be brave\n\nBut when the warning sounds\n\nIt echoes to the grave\n\n\n\nWe keep blindly moving\n\nAlong the same old path\n\nNo common sense\n\nWould guide us back to life\n\n\n\nNow look at us\n\nThe pinnacle conception\n\nHow we assumed\n\nThese walls would never fall\n\n\n\nSleep\n\nFarewell forever child\n\nFarewell\n\n\n\nWe are the last to walk the earth\n\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\n\nHow it burns to embrace\n\nThat below the lilac skies\n\nEternity is just a breath away\n\n\n\nIn lockstep to damnation\n\nTo our dying breath\n\nEvery reckless footprint\n\nLeaves the smell of death\n\n\n\nOn the wilting meadows\n\nWe let them out to play\n\nWe said - No need to worry\n\nNow they never may\n\n\n\nSleep\n\nFarewell forever\n\n\n\nWe are the last to walk the earth\n\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\n\nHow it burns to embrace\n\nThat below the lilac skies\n\nEternity is just a breath away",
