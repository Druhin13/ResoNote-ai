  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson We Got Love par Noize Generation\r\nForget this party\nWe are going home\nMy drink is warm\nThis room’s about to overflow\nClothes all sweaty\nIt’s damp in there\nYou think I am petty I do not care\n\nNow we’re driving, we’re driving, we’re driving fast\nNever asking where we are going next\nBaby, pop the bottle, pour some more\nNo need to show off on the dance floor\n\nYou got money, we are broke, we got everything you don’t\n\nWe got love, we got love\nYou got money, we are broke, we got everything you don’t\nWe got love, we got love\n\nThrow that glitter\nGot everything my heart could wish for\nCause life’s to bitter\nIf chains and shoes is what you live for\n\nNow we’re driving, we’re driving, we’re driving fast\nNever asking where we are going next\nBaby, pop the bottle, pour some more\nNo need to show off on the dance floor\n\nYou got money, we are broke, we got everything you don’t\n\nWe got love, we got love\nYou got money, we are broke, we got everything you don’t\nWe got love, we got love",
