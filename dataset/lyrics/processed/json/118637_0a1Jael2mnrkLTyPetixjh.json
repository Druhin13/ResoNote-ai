  "lyrics": "Wandering soul\r\nWandering mind\r\nWondering what’s gone wrong with me\r\nAnd try not to try\r\nSwayed by the wind\r\nSwayed by desire\n\nCan’t reach the moon up above\n\nAnd I don’t dare touch the fire\n\n\n\n'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nAnd I want you all the time\n\n\n\nAlways on my mind\n\nAlways alone\n\nYou could be miles and miles away\n\nBut somehow you're close\n\nIf I can't have my cake\n\nAnd I can't eat it too\n\nWell, I guess the sound of your voice\n\nIn the aching will just have to do\n\n\n\n'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nAnd I want you all the time\n\n\n\nAnd if you never come back\n\nIf you never call\n\nI say I'll understand when I don’t at all\n\n\n\n'Cause the trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nAnd I want you all the time\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nThe trouble with wanting is I want you\n\nI see you there and I see that line\n\n(The trouble with wanting is I want you)\n\nAnd I want you all the time\n\nOh, I want you all the time",
