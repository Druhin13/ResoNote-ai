  "lyrics": "I drive home the same way\r\nTwo left turns off the interstate\r\nAnd she's always standing\r\nAt the stoplight on 18th street\r\nShe could be a Sarah\r\nShe could be an Emily\n\nAn Olivia, maybe Cassidy\n\nWith the shaky hands \n\nOn the cardboard sign \n\nAnd she's lookin' at me\n\n\n\nBet she was somebody's best friend laughing\n\nBack when she was somebody's sister\n\nCountin' change at the lemonade stand\n\nProbably somebody's high school first kiss\n\nDancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans\n\nNow this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars\n\nAnd I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her\n\nShe's somebody's daughter\n\nSomebody's daughter\n\nSomebody's daughter\n\n\n\nDid she give up wondering where the cars all go?\n\nAnd can she even tell that I don't know what to say?\n\nSo I just nod my head and wave\n\nWell, no one's gonna ask what she wants to be\n\nOr why we're both stuck here at the mercy of geography\n\nAnd whether it shines or rains\n\n\n\nBet she was somebody's best friend laughing\n\nBack when she was somebody's sister\n\nCountin' change at the lemonade stand\n\nProbably somebody's high school first kiss\n\nDancin' in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans\n\nNow this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars\n\nAnd I'll wonder how she fell and no one caught her\n\nShe's somebody's daughter\n\nSomebody's daughter\n\nSomebody's daughter\n\n\n\nOh, I don't know the reasons why\n\nI'm the one who's driving by\n\nAnd she's the one on the corner of 18th Street\n\n\n\nBet she was somebody's best friend\n\nBack when she was somebody's sister\n\nBet she was somebody's first kiss\n\nDancing in a gym where the kids all talk about someday, someday\n\nNow this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars\n\nOh, and I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her\n\nShe's somebody's daughter\n\nShe's somebody's daughter",
