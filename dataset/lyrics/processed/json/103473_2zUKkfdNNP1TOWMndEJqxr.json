  "lyrics": "Yeah, we had some good times\r\nEnded up on good terms\r\nAnd I can't help but smile when that comes up on radio\r\nWe still got the same friends\r\nI still see you out at parties\r\nSometimes we get to talking\n\nMaybe dancing, a little close\n\nYeah, it makes me think\n\n\n\nWhen we walked away\n\nWhen we said goodbye\n\nBaby, we must have been out of our minds\n\nOh, when you're leaning up against me\n\nAnd looking at me like you're looking at me right now, right now\n\nYou got me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\n\n\nSeems we might've let it go too fast, call the quits too quick\n\nTook back my t-shirt, gave back your vinal and moved on\n\nWe should be in the same cab, going to the same place\n\nDoing what we used to do all night long\n\n\n\nWhen we walked away\n\nWhen we said goodbye\n\nBaby, we must have been out of our minds\n\nOh, when you're leaning up against me\n\nAnd looking at me like you're looking at me right now, right now\n\nYou got me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\n\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\nYeah, you got me having second thoughts\n\n\n\nWhen we walked away\n\nWhen we said goodbye\n\nBaby, we must have been out of our minds, yeah\n\nOh, when you're leaning up against me\n\nAnd looking at me like you're looking at me right now, right now\n\nYou got me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\nYou got me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts\n\nGot me having second thoughts",
