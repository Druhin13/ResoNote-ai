  "lyrics": "If I say it loud it, would it make it real?\r\nAnd if you go now, would I feel anything?\r\nWhen you're out on the weekends\r\nCatching up with your old friends\r\nDo they ask you 'bout how we've been\r\nWhen you're walking home, do you think of me?\n\n\n\nAnd how I fell in deep when you touched my skin\n\nHow easily my hands left you shivering\n\nDidn't catch our breath before we jumped right in\n\nNow I don't know if we can make it out\n\nBreaking everything with a single touch\n\nI don't even know how to make us stop\n\nThis might be the part where you lose me\n\n\n\nAnd I'm about to, I'm about to\n\nI'm about to lose you too, ooh\n\nYeah, I'm about to lose you too, ooh\n\n\n\nIf you let me go, will you let me know?\n\nAnd if we leave it here are we letting go\n\nOf drive away's on the weekends\n\nHundred nights with no sleep and\n\nHundred miles with no seat belts on\n\nWhen I feel alone, do you think of me?\n\n\n\nAnd how I fell in deep when you touched my skin\n\nHow easily my hands left you shivering\n\nHow we went from how are you to how you've been\n\nNow I don't know if we can make it out\n\nBreaking everything with a single touch\n\nI don't even know how to make us stop\n\nThis might be the part where you lose me\n\n\n\nBut I'm about to, I'm about to\n\nI'm about to lose you too, ooh\n\nI'm about to lose you too, I know, ooh\n\n\n\nI'm about to lose you too, ooh\n\nI'm about to lose you too, ooh\n\nIf you let me go, will you let me know?\n\n'Cause I'm about to lose you too, ooh\n\n\n\nAnd how I fell in deep when you touched my skin\n\nHow easily my hands left you shivering\n\nHow we went from how are you to how you've been",
