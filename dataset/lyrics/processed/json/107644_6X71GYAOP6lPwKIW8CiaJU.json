  "lyrics": "Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press\r\nWhoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.\r\nThey say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,\r\nShe inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.\r\nI can't help it if I'm lucky.\n\nPeople see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act\n\nTheir minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.\n\nEven you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,\n\nI couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that\n\nSweet lady.\n\n\n\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,\n\nBlowing down the backroads headin' south.\n\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,\n\nYou're an idiot, babe.\n\nIt's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.\n\n\n\nI ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike\n\nI haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.\n\nThere's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,\n\nYou didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars\n\nAfter losin' every battle.\n\n\n\nI woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are\n\nVisions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars.\n\nYou hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.\n\nOne day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,\n\nBlood on your saddle.\n\n\n\nIdiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,\n\nBlowing through the curtains in your room.\n\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,\n\nYou're an idiot, babe.\n\nIt's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.\n\n\n\nIt was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart\n\nYou tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.\n\nNow everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,\n\nWhat's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top\n\nYou're on the bottom.\n\n\n\nI noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind\n\nI can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes\n\ndon't look into mine.\n\nThe priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building \n\nburned.\n\nI waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime \n\nturned Slowly into autumn.\n\n\n\nIdiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,\n\nFrom the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.\n\nIdiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,\n\nYou're an idiot, babe.\n\nIt's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.\n\n\n\nI can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read\n\nEvery time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.\n\nDown the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,\n\nI followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory\n\nAnd all your ragin' glory.\n\n\n\nI been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,\n\nI kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.\n\nYou'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,\n\nAnd I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,\n\nAnd it makes me feel so sorry.\n\n\n\nIdiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,\n\nBlowing through the letters that we wrote.\n\nIdiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,\n\nWe're idiots, babe.\n\nIt's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.",
