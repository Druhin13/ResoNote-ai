  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson So fast, so numb par R.E.M\r\n   \n\nMovin' through rough waters motel boy,\nand swimming in your sleep.\nHow could I be so blind, mis-sighted,\nnot to see there's something wounded deep.\n\nAnyone could scratch your surface now,\nit's all amphetamine\nyou're blasting yourself into the present\nlearn some vast indignity, stay that,\n\nYou say that you hate it\nyou want to re-create it\nI've been around, I've been your lover.\nI let it go at Kill Devil Hill,\n\nYou're coming onto something so fast, so numb\nthat you can't even feel.\n\nYou're drinking the wrong dream now baby,\nYou do-si-do, saddo\nYou're you in cartilage, shark-eyed, shock horror, all present tense,\nand boy your blood is running cold.\nListen, this is now, this is here, this is me,\nthis is what I wanted you to see.\nThat was then, was that, that is gone, this is past,\nyou cast yourself cast, passed by, gone down fast.\n\nYou say that you hate it.\nYou want to recreate it.\nI've played this round, I've played your lover.\n\nI've played it out to the hilt.\nYou're comin' on with something so fast, so numb\nthat you can't even feel.\n\nYou love it. You hate it.\nYou want to re-create it.\nNow, this is here, this is me.\nThis is what I wanted you to see.\nThat was then, was that, that is gone.\nThat is what I wanted you to feel.\n\nYou love it. You hate it.\nYou spit it out, the bitter pill.\nI've been around, I've been your lover\nI let it go at Kill Devil Hill.\nYou're coming onto something so fast, so numb\nthat you can't even feel.\n\n\nI've played this round, I've played your lover.\nI've played it out to the hilt.\nYou're comin' on with something so fast, so numb\nthat you can't even feel.\n\nyou played around, you played me lover,\nI let it go at Kill Devil Hill,\nYou're moving so hard, so fast, so numb\nthat you can't even feel.",
