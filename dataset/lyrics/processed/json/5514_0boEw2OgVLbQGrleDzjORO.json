  "lyrics": "Yeah we could wait for the sun to go down, count the hours til it's time to go out, but the radio's on and it's playing our song. Girl I cant help but see the sweat on your skin, makes me want to put something cool in your hand and take that t-shirt off. Is that so wrong?\r\nWhat you say we do a little day drinking? Tell me girl are you thinking, girl, what I'm thinking? We could stay right here and just start working on a buzz, soaking in the sun. No we ain't in no rush, so what you say we do a little day drinking? Yeah, some day drinking.\r\nGirl, there's just something bout nothing to do. We could turn a happy hour right into two, three, or four if you want. It'd be a shame if we don't.\n\nWhat you say we do a little day drinking? Tell me girl are you thinking, girl, what I'm thinking? We could stay right here and just start working on a buzz, soaking in the sun. No we ain't in no rush, so what you say we do a little day drinking? Yeah, some day drinking. Let's go.\n\n\n\nSo come on and raise a cup. Aw yeah, bottom's up. Until the night comes you and me just..\n\n\n\nDay drinking. Tell me girl are you thinking, girl, what I'm thinking? We could stay right here and just start working on a buzz, soaking in the sun. No we ain't in no rush, so what you say we do a little day drinking? Yeah, some day drinking. Ain't nothing wrong with a little day drinking, some day drinking.",
