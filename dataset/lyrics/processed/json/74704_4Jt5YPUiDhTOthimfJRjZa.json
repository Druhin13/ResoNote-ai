  "lyrics": "I'm always waking up too early\r\nHeavy set in my routine\r\nI don't like it when things fall out\r\nI don't like it when they leave me\r\nIf I finally understand\n\nHow it feels to be noticed\n\nHow it feels to be loved then\n\nI can sleep through the morning\n\n\n\nIt's ok to be at home\n\nI'm gonna keep my head down\n\n'Cause if I ever see too clearly\n\nI'm gonna knock the lights out\n\n\n\nIt's ok to be alone\n\n'Cause I'm gonna make it happen\n\nI'm gonna make it perfect\n\nBetter than it has been\n\n\n\nOh, I'm tryna make it cool\n\nAnd I'm tryna make it by\n\nDon't tell me that I'm wrong\n\n'Cause ain't nobody right\n\n\n\nSay I'm doing fine but I could be a little better\n\nOkay, maybe I'm thinking too much and you're just clearer\n\nOkay, and I'm begging for your words\n\nTo be something good I've never heard\n\nI'm crying, there's something wrong\n\n\n\nYou don't want to be\n\nSomething special to you or me\n\nOh, baby, you don't want to be\n\nSomething special to you or me\n\n\n\nOh, I'm tryna make it cool\n\nAnd I'm tryna make it by\n\nDon't tell me that I'm wrong\n\n'Cause ain't nobody right\n\n\n\nI'm tryna make it cool\n\nAnd I'm tryna make it by\n\nDon't tell me that I'm wrong\n\n'Cause ain't nobody right",
