(Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nShould be here with me instead! (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nWhat about those words you said? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nWhat about us?\n\n(What about us?)\n\nOh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating\nOh why are we are waiting so long, I'm suffocating\n\nI love to hear you whisper\nTake it take it lower\nDon't be 'fraid to show her, what you freakin' do\nCause we can do it nightly\nYou get me excited\nNow it's my turn (yes it's my turn)\n\nSo give it to me, why are we waiting?\nI know what you need\nAnd I'm not gonna stop\n\n\nWhatever the weather\nWe gon' be better together\nSo what's up baby?\nWhat about us?\n\n'Cos I've been watchin' and waitin'\nWhy don't you give it or take it?\nSo what's up baby?\nWhat about us?\n\nWatcha doin' to my head? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nShould be here with me instead! (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nWhat about those words you said? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nWhat about us?\n(What about us?)\n\n\n\n[Longer version additional verse:]\n'Cause you've been watchin' me, watching me\nYeah wherever I go\n'Cause you're a criminal, criminal\nYeah deep down to the core\nI know that you ain't seen, you ain't seen\nSomething like this before\nAnd you know like I know you should be givin' it up\n\nWhatever the weather\nWe gon' be better together\nSo what's up baby?\nWhat about us? (What about us? Yeah)\n\n'Cause I've been watchin' and waitin'\nWhy don't you give it or take it?\n\nSo what's up baby?\nWhat about us?\n\nWatcha doin' to my head? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nShould be here with me instead! (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nWhat about those words you said? (Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nWhat about us?\n(What about us?)\n\nLet me take the lead\n(Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nYou know what I need\n(Na, na, na, na, na, na)\nPut my mind at ease\nAnd tell me what about us?\nWhat about us?",
