  "lyrics": "I love you in the morning when the blood runs down your cheeks\r\nBabe, you are the first thing and the last thing that I'd see\r\nI was just a boy striking matches upon your heart\r\nI couldn't get no sparks\r\nAsk me to go faster, put my foot down to the floor\r\nStanding at the edge, I feel like I've been here before\n\nI loved you in the darkness and I loved you in fluorescent light\n\nIf it don't feel right, babe\n\n\n\nYou can run and hide, babe\n\nLike a bird you can take flight\n\nIf I been holding on too tight\n\nIf I been holding on\n\n\n\nMmm, oooh\n\nOooh, oooh, ooooh\n\n\n\nYour mother always told us we should go out to the dance\n\nYou can't get struck by lightning if your not standing in the rain\n\nTake it as the truth or you can take it with a grain of salt\n\nIf it don't work out\n\nYou were in the shower we were talking through the glass\n\nPacking up your suitcase, you were humming to yourself\n\nOne day you were smiling\n\nI could tell by how you sounded on the phone\n\nYes, I'm coming home, babe\n\n\n\nI'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe\n\nI'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe\n\nI'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe\n\nI'm thinking 'bout coming home\n\nMmm\n\nI'm thinking 'bout coming home, babe\n\nMmm\n\nI'm thinking 'bout coming home",
