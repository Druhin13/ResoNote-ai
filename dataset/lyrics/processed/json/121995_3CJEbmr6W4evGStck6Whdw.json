  "lyrics": "Baby, you ain't gotta wait forever\r\nBefore you go and break my heart\r\nIf you're thinking that we shouldn't be together\r\nJust leave me in the dark a little longer\r\nDo it on the highway, do it on the drive way\n\nChevrolet backing out\n\nBut not here in this cafe booth with you\n\nDon't ruin this perfect town\n\n\n\nSay it's over over on the west coast somewhere\n\nIn the middle of the city, new years eve time square\n\nIf you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright\n\nJust don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride\n\nNo, don't take me down low when we're up this high\n\nDon't you tell me goodbye here in Telluride\n\n\n\nEver since we touched down in Colorado\n\nI could tell something wasn't right\n\n'Cause you look at those snow capped mountain\n\nYou won't look into my eyes\n\n\n\nDo it in a text, better yet in a letter\n\nYou can leave my pillow case\n\nYou can rack me back in Tennessee\n\nAnywhere but this place\n\n\n\nSay it's over over on the west coast somewhere\n\nIn the middle of the city, new years eve time square\n\nIf you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright\n\nJust don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride\n\nNo, don't take me down low when we're up this high\n\nDon't you tell me goodbye here in Telluride\n\n\n\n\n\nDo it on the highway, do it on the drive way\n\nChevrolet backing out\n\nBut not here in this cafe booth with you\n\nDon't ruin this perfect town\n\n\n\nDon't say it's over underneath this sky so blue\n\nDon't say it's over, have a little mercy girl, won't you?\n\n\n\nSay it's over from your window seat on our flight home\n\nMaybe once we get back do it over the phone\n\nIf you gotta let me go I'm gonna be alright\n\nJust don't tell me goodbye here in Telluride\n\nNo, don't take me down low when we're up this high\n\nDon't you tell me goodbye in Telluride\n\nDon't you tell me goodbye in Telluride",
