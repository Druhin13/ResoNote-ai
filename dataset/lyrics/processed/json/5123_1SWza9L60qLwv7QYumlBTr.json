  "lyrics": "Eyes wide shut dreaming about you\r\nHot blood rush turning a cold blue\r\nSee you touch but I’m feeling nothing but I’m feeling nothing\r\nI’m in California you, you out in Georgia\r\nBut we both in the same room\n\nStaring at perfection, I’m about to wreck it\n\nIt’s just something I gotta do\n\n\n\nI think I wanna lose you\n\nJust to find my way back to you\n\nI think I wanna break up\n\nJust to make it all up to you\n\nI don’t wanna let go, let go\n\nBut I gotta let go, let go\n\nI think I wanna lose you\n\nJust to find my way back to you\n\n\n\nI can’t blame you if you hate me\n\nYou might think I’m some kind of crazy\n\nAsking me “Did you even love me?”\n\n“Did you even love me?”\n\n\n\nCause I’m in California, you you out in Georgia\n\nBut we both in the same room\n\nBut I, if I stay with you we won’t make it\n\nIt’s just something we gotta do\n\n\n\nI think I wanna lose you\n\nJust to find my way back to you\n\nI think I wanna break up\n\nJust to make it all up to you\n\nI don’t wanna let go, let go\n\nBut I gotta let go, let go\n\nI think I wanna lose you\n\nJust to find my way back to you\n\n\n\nI don’t wanna let go\n\nBut I gotta let go\n\n\n\nI think I wanna lose you\n\nJust to find my way back to you\n\nI think I wanna break up\n\nJust to make it all up to you\n\nI don’t wanna let go, let go\n\nBut I gotta let go, let go\n\nI think I wanna lose you\n\nJust to find my way back to you",
