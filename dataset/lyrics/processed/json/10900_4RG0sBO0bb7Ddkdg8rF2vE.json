  "lyrics": "You wake up late, you feel your heart begin to work\r\nAnd now you're all dressed up of course\r\nAnd hailing cabs out of your door\r\nOn 14th Street I feel my head between my knees\r\nAnd orange swimming through the trees\r\nAnd orange swimming through the trees\n\nWhere could I go? What could I do?\n\nPut in the state, my lips and eyes give me away\n\nAnd now there's nothing, I can say no\n\nI'm pulled away, I see another of myself\n\nWho's found true love and happiness\n\nTo sit and smoke there on the chair for\n\n\n\nTwo boys, one to kiss your neck\n\nAnd one to bring you breakfast\n\nGet you out of bed when\n\nYou're sore from the night before\n\nFrom knocking on my door\n\nYour head against the floor boards\n\nTwo boys, one to love you sweetly\n\nOne does so discreetly\n\nNever will he meet me\n\nBut I'm sure that you'll catch your breath\n\nYou'll sleep into the day\n\nTo wake up with sunlight across your room\n\n\n\nBefore I leave I want to try to go back in time\n\nTo just that moment in my life where I should have spoke up but I lied\n\nAs I sat there with my jaw open and I smiled\n\nHe pulled his sweater off and tried to explain he'd all but given up on love\n\nI'm pulled away, I see another of myself who's found true love and happiness\n\nTo sit and smoke there on the chair\n\nBeside the bed I read this past week's New Yorker\n\nAnd I watch him paint Antarctica, and watch him paint Antarctica\n\n\n\nTwo boys, one to kiss your neck\n\nAnd one to bring you breakfast\n\nGet you out of bed when\n\nYou're sore from the night before\n\nFrom knocking at my door\n\nYour head against the floor boards\n\nTwo boys, one to love you sweetly\n\nOne does so discreetly\n\nNever will he meet me\n\nBut I'm sure that you'll catch your breath\n\nYou'll sleep into the day\n\nTo wake up with sunlight across your room\n\n\n\nTelling me something or nothing\n\nNever the one thing I wanna hear\n\nTelling me something or nothing\n\nNever the one thing I wanna hear\n\nTelling me something or nothing\n\nNever the one thing I wanna hear",
