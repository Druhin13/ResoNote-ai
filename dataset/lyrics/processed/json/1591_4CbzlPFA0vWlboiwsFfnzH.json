  "lyrics": "I was also gon' ask about your fear as an individual\r\nYou know, it's plenty of people\r\nFeel a sense of security around you and kinda lean on you\r\nYou ever feel like a certain amount of pressure from that?\r\nDo you ever get afraid?\r\nOf course I do, I mean everybody gets afraid sometimes\n\nWhat possibly could make you afraid?\n\nWhat are you afraid of? (afraid of, afraid of)\n\n\n\nI'm afraid, I'm afraid\n\nSometimes I'm even afraid to admit I'm afraid\n\nI'm afraid of the weight of my problems\n\nHaters working overtime, 8 or 9 jobs worth\n\nAll these wanted ski masks niggas\n\nOld basketball shorts under jean ass niggas need to know\n\nI'm a product of a dead poet rhyming at his low\n\nEquals Mya Angelou, my emphatic flow can rise the status quo\n\nLying on the padded floor, addict at it's best\n\nEradicated from the fabricated\n\nAfraid of the thought of releasing music that's indicative\n\nOf where I'm at in life, will they like? Will they hate?\n\nThe better question is if they hate it, is you down to pay the price?\n\nI'll look you right in your eyes and say you motherfuckin' right\n\nDon't bother me with adversity\n\nI conquered more ground than King Kong could\n\nAll I think about these days is mom good\n\nCause she diabetic, my daddy just had a cancer scare\n\nAnd do he still work at the post office? The answer's yeah\n\nI'm introverted, knowing that it's not about Oz\n\nBigger problems outside\n\n\n\nThere's a war going on outside\n\nThat no man is safe from\n\nYou see you can smile\n\nBut that won't change the color of your skin\n\nBut I'm the sinner\n\nYet you kick me, punch me, say don't trust me\n\nShoot me down like I'm up to something\n\nFuck with me and say I've deceived you\n\nBut how's that legal?\n\nAm I that evil? Why do you hate me?\n\n\n\nI'm afraid of you going to college\n\nAnd not acknowledging I'm your father cause you not proud enough\n\nBut I fought hard to make sure\n\nYou never see certain things I'm a product of\n\nIt's easy to confuse being a father\n\nWith being a provider but all we got is us\n\nAnd I'm afraid to lose you\n\nYou the coolest kid I ever saw, she did a good job with you\n\nSometimes I hesitate to take credit for raising you too\n\nCause all I did was discipline\n\nI never taught you to ride a bike but we still a lot alike\n\nAnd you making music now? I wonder what made you wanna give this a spin\n\nYou know what I'm about to say next, right?\n\nI'm afraid of you drinkin'\n\nThough I never taught you to swim, I'm afraid of you sinkin'\n\nI know I taught you to fight, you ain't in condition to win this\n\nYou wired different\n\nYou just ain't the nigga you friends is, it's scientific\n\nNot my opinion so you know you genetically predisposed\n\nTo more than just eating soul food, so I'm afraid of you to try to risk it\n\nYou in a gene pool with a lot of sick fish\n\nAnd I'm the sickest of them all\n\nAlcoholics stop from the symptoms of withdrawal\n\nLook out the window, tell me what you see\n\nPolice shootin' brothers the color of you and me\n\nAnd they actin' like they hate us so you may just wanna love yourself enough to compensate it\n\nIf I can say this, say this one thing, this one thing non-related\n\nYou were never, ever, ever, better than me in basketball\n\nPffft, hahaha! Yeah right, sure",
