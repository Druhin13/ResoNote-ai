  "lyrics": "I see you’re hurting and in fact I know you’re mad\r\nFrom perfectly identical insertions of our past\r\nThe anger that you’ve pushed down surfaces at last\r\nYou’re certain that they’re doing it on purpose and you spas\r\nBut meanwhile I was shot down last week\r\nBy another young brother same color as me\n\nLeft me in a blood pool damn, did me wrong huh\n\nLaughed like it was cool must of heard it in a song huh\n\nAnd the last thing I saw was my daughter on the porch\n\nWhat was once a loving dad, now a problem to report\n\nRealize the bigger problem is the problem we endorse\n\nWatched her hero transform from a father to a corpse\n\nAnd of course the perp was a young black male\n\nAnd of course the victim was a young black male\n\nSo report the ignorance that you have tracked well\n\nWhen you rap, make money, kill niggas, make crack sells\n\nCan’t you see we’re in a state of emergency\n\nWe’re obsessed and possessed with possessions and currency\n\nAnd you glorify the curse that you throw inside a verse\n\nWe hate how they treat us, but we treat ourselves worst\n\nLet’s stop killing each other and start killing the ignorance\n\nWe’ll succeed if we proceed with persistence and diligence\n\nThink of the women and the children if you’re needing some sentiment\n\nThe bullets hurt worst when piercing the innocent\n\n\n\nI see you’re hurting and obviously confused\n\nUnderstand that this country was designed for us to lose\n\nThat doesn’t have to depict the destiny that we choose\n\nWe really need to switch up the recipe of cool\n\nYou don’t think you can succeed but trust me I know you can\n\nWe have too many niggas I want you to grow a man\n\nWe don’t have to yell pause just for me to hold your hand\n\nWe are a stolen people we’re treading on stolen land\n\nIntelligence isn’t popular, and the only thing that’s stopping us is ignorance and hate man this poverty is costing us\n\nAll of us, not bloods not the crips but all of us\n\nThe biggest gang in the whole world is the one they call haul us up\n\nCan’t you see we’re in a state of emergency?\n\nWe’re obsessed and possessed by possessions and currency\n\nAnd you glorify the curse that you throw inside a verse\n\nWe hate the way they treat us, but we treat ourselves worst\n\nSo before you pull that trigger could you be more considerate\n\nMr. officer trust me our family is missing us\n\nThink of our women and our children if you’re needing some sentiment\n\nThose bullets hurt worst when they’re piercing the innocent",
