  "lyrics": "Keep drinking coffee, stare me down across the table\r\nWhile I look outside\r\nSo many things I'd say if only I were able\r\nBut I just keep quiet and count the cars that pass by\r\nYou've got opinions, man\n\nWe're all entitled to 'em, but I never asked\n\nSo let me thank you for your time, and try not to waste anymore of mine\n\nAnd get out of here fast\n\n\n\nI hate to break it to you babe, but I'm not drowning\n\nThere's no one here to save\n\n\n\nWho cares if you disagree?\n\nYou are not me\n\nWho made you king of anything?\n\nSo you dare tell me who to be?\n\nWho died and made you king of anything?\n\n\n\nYou sound so innocent, all full of good intent\n\nSwear you know best\n\nBut you expect me to jump up on board with you\n\nAnd ride off into your delusional sunset\n\n\n\nI'm not the one who's lost with no direction\n\nBut you'll never see\n\nYou're so busy making maps with my name on them in all caps\n\nYou got the talking down, just not the listening\n\n\n\nAnd who cares if you disagree?\n\nYou are not me\n\nWho made you king of anything?\n\nSo you dare tell me who to be?\n\nWho died and made you king of anything?\n\n\n\nAll my life I've tried to make everybody happy\n\nWhile I just hurt and hide\n\nWaiting for someone to tell me it's my turn to decide\n\n\n\nWho cares if you disagree?\n\nYou are not me\n\nWho made you king of anything?\n\nSo you dare tell me who to be?\n\nWho died and made you king of anything?\n\n\n\nWho cares if you disagree?\n\nYou are not me\n\nWho made you king of anything?\n\nSo you dare tell me who to be?\n\nWho died and made you king of anything?\n\n\n\nLet me hold your crown, babe\n\n\n\n(Grazie a MaLiziA_Miky per questo testo)",
