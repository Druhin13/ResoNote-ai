  "lyrics": "Can you stay up for the weekend?\r\nAnd blame god for looking too old\r\nCan you find all that you stand for?\r\nHas been replaced with mountains of gold\r\nYou can untrain yourself to notice\n\nTo feel pain and swallow fear\n\nBut can you stay up for the weekend 'til next year\n\n\n\nGod I can't do this anymore\n\nOh I'll be laid down on the floor\n\nAs many feet walk through the door\n\nI'm not alone\n\n\n\n(Instrumental)\n\n\n\nIf I see a light flashin'\n\nCould this mean that I'm comin' home?\n\nIf I see a man waving\n\nDoes this mean that I'm not alone?\n\n(x2)\n\n\n\n(Instrumental)\n\n\n\nIf I see a light flashin\n\nCould this mean that I'm comin home?\n\nIf I see a man waving\n\nDoes this mean that I'm not alone?\n\n(x2)\n\n\n\n(Instrumental)\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Calvo Harrie for these lyrics)",
