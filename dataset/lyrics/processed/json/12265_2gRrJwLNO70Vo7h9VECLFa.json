  "lyrics": "The simplest things\r\nCan be the hardest to do\r\nCan't find what you're looking for\r\nEven when it's looking for you\r\nThe judge and the criminal\r\nThe sinner and the priest\n\nGot something in common\n\nBring 'em all to their knees\n\nDo what you can do what you must\n\nEverybody's crying about\n\nSome love and trust\n\nI walk the line walk it for us\n\nSee me up here trying to find\n\nSome love and trust\n\nLust ain't nothing\n\nBut stealing from a thief\n\nStorm after storm\n\nLeave you shaking like a leaf\n\nThey say broken hearts\n\nMake the world go 'round\n\nBut trading headaches for heartbreaks\n\nGonna get you down\n\nGive it some time don't try to rush\n\nWhen you're trying to find yourself\n\nSome love and trust\n\nDo all you can might not be enough\n\nWhen you're trying to get yourself\n\nSome love and trust\n\nLike a horse in a race\n\nThat doesn't want to run\n\nAn executioner who won't fire his gun\n\nLike a boxer who won't take a swing\n\nLike a prince\n\nWho don't want to be a king\n\nHaven't we suffered\n\nSuffered enough\n\nNow we're out here fighting\n\nAbout some love and trust\n\nDo all you can just hope it's enough\n\nEverybody's crying about\n\nSome love and trust",
