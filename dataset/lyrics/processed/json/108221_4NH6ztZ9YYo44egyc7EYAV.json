  "lyrics": "No more walks in the wood\r\nThe trees have all been cut down\r\nAnd where once they stood\r\nNot even a wagon rut\r\nAppears along the path\r\nLow brush is taking over\n\n\n\nNo more walks in the wood\n\nThis is the aftermath\n\nOf afternoons in the clover fields\n\nWhere we once made love\n\nThen wandered home together\n\nWhere the trees arched above\n\nWhere we made our own weather\n\nWhen branches were the sky\n\nNow they are gone for good\n\nAnd you, for ill, and I\n\nAm only a passer-by\n\n\n\nWe and the trees and the way\n\nBack from the fields of play\n\nLasted as long as we could\n\nNo more walks in the wood\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Sugumar for these lyrics)",
