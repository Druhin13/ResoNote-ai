  "lyrics": "Keep, keep it together\r\nKeep people together forever and ever\r\nI got brothers, I got some sisters too\r\nStuck in the middle tell you what I'm gonna do\r\nGonna get out of here, I'm gonna leave this place\n\nSo I can forget every single hungry face\n\nI'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs\n\nTo get attention I must always be the clown\n\nI wanna be different, I wanna be on my own\n\nBut Daddy said listen, you will always have a home\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\n\n\nKeep it together in the family\n\nThey're a reminder of your history\n\nBrothers and sisters they hold the key\n\nTo your heart and your soul\n\nDon't forget that your family is gold\n\n\n\nI hit the big time but I still get the blues\n\nEveryone's a stranger, city life can get to you\n\nPeople can be so cold, never want to turn your back\n\nJust givin' to get something\n\nAlways wanting something back\n\nWhen I get lonely and I need to be\n\nLoved for who I am, not what they want to see\n\nBrothers and sisters, they've always been there for me\n\nWe have a connection, home is where the heart should be\n\n\n\n(chorus)\n\n\n\nIntermediate:\n\n\n\nWhen I look back on all the misery\n\nAnd all the heartache that they brought to me\n\nI wouldn't change it for another chance\n\n'Cause blood is thicker than any other circumstance\n\n\n\nWhen I get lonely and I need to be\n\nLoved for who I am, not what they want to see\n\nBrothers and sisters, they've always been there for me\n\nWe have a connection, home is where the heart should be\n\n\n\n(intermediate)\n\n(chorus)\n\n\n\nKeep, keep it together\n\nKeep people together forever and ever\n\n(repeat and fade)",
