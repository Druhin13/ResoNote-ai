  "lyrics": "Old familiar face, that bitter taste\r\nShe's been hanging around too long\r\nThat crooked tongue, so pale, so young\r\nMakes me warm\r\nTake me to the darkness, hang me out to dry\n\nTangled in your legs, in the webs of your lies\n\nLead me to the rapture, set my body free\n\nHigher than the flames, set blaze inside of me, whoa\n\nThere's no turning back, there's no coming down\n\nI'm forever lost, there's no coming down\n\n\n\nOh, I'm skin and bones, pale as a ghost\n\nI know that I should be moving on\n\nBut in your embrace, you know I'll never change\n\nHopeless, I am chained down on my knees\n\n\n\nTake me to the darkness, hang me out to dry\n\nTangled in your legs, in the webs of your lies\n\nLead me to the rapture, set my body free\n\nHigher than the flames, set blaze inside of me, whoa\n\nThere's no turning back, there's no coming down\n\nI'm forever lost, there's no coming down\n\n\n\nWhen you call my name, I'm never far away\n\nWhen you call my name, I know there's no escape\n\n\n\nTake me to the darkness, hang me out to dry\n\nTangled in your legs, in the webs of your lies\n\nLead me to the rapture, set my body free\n\nHigher than the flames, set blaze inside of me, whoa\n\nThere's no turning back, there's no coming down\n\nI'm forever lost, there's no coming down",
