  "lyrics": "Someday I'll find you\r\nI'll meet you, complete you\r\nSomeday I'll dig out my eyes\r\nIt's all a painting, a brand new Mercedes\r\nCrashing and burning alive\n\n\n\nToday we swam out where the sun hit the horizon\n\nBut I kept your head under a tide\n\nIt's all compassion, distractions from my actions\n\nToo late I'll never realize, realize\n\n\n\nI'm always gonna miss you\n\nI'm always gonna feel you\n\nIn everything that I do, I do\n\nTo never be with you, oh I miss you so\n\nIf only I could see you\n\nI'd tell you that I love you, I do\n\nSomeday I'll be with you\n\nOh, I love you so",
