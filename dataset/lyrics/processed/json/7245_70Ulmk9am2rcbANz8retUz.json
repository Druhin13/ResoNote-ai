  "lyrics": "In another dimension\r\nLike clothes that you wear\r\nA mighty mighty battle\r\nSprouting illegal hair\r\nA fitness consultant\r\nIn the negative zone\n\nWandering the city\n\nLooking for a home\n\n\n\nI dance like this\n\nBecause it feels so damn good\n\nIf I could dance better\n\nWell you know that I would\n\n\n\nHow the rumour got started\n\nOne can only guess\n\nAnd the truth don't mean nothing\n\nIf you ain't got the cash\n\nA credit card mommy\n\nAn invisible dad\n\nCareer opportunities\n\nThat you never had\n\n\n\nWe dance like this\n\nBecause it feels so damn good\n\nIf we could dance better\n\nWell you know that we would\n\n\n\nI'm working on my dancing\n\nThis is the best I can do\n\nI'm tentatively shaking\n\nYou don't have to look\n\nCan't say I'm sorry\n\nI can't say I'm ashamed\n\nCan't think of tomorrow\n\nWhen it seems so far away\n\n\n\nWe dance like this\n\nBecause it feels so damn good\n\nIf we could dance better\n\nWell you know that we would\n\nWe dance like this\n\nBecause it feels so damn good\n\nIf we could dance better\n\nWell you know that we would",
