  "lyrics": "I can't recall one time in my life\r\nI've felt as lonely as I do tonight\r\nI feel like I could lay down and get up no more\r\nIt's the damndest feeling, I never felt it before\r\nTonight I feel like an old violin\n\nSoon to be put away and never played again\n\n\n\nDon't ask me why I feel like this, hell, I can't say\n\nI only wish this feeling would just go away\n\nI guess it's 'cause the truth is the hardest thing I've ever faced\n\n'Cause you can't change the truth in the slightest way\n\nI've tried\n\n\n\nSo I asked myself, I said \"George, where in the hell do you go from here?\"\n\nThen like a fool, I turned around and I looked in the mirror\n\n\n\nAnd there I was seeing an old violin\n\nSoon to be put away and never played again\n\n\n\nSo one more time, just to be sure\n\nI said \"George, where you gonna go from here?\"\n\nAnd you know, there wasn't a nickel's worth of difference\n\nWhen I looked into the mirror\n\n\n\n'Cause there I was seeing an old violin\n\nSoon to be put away and never played again\n\n\n\nAnd just like that, it hit me why that old violin and I were just alike\n\nWe give our all to music, and soon we'll give our life\n\nPrecious memories, how they linger",
