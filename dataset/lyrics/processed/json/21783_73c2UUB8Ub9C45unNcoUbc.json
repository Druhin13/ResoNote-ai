  "lyrics": "I took some time to myself\r\nTo sort out all the things\r\nThat make me feel the way that I feel\r\nJust this year I lost a basketball team to heaven\r\nAnd I'm sure they're shooting jumpers\n\nWith Jesus, Mary, and Joseph\n\nAnd you said we wouldn't notice it\n\nIf you had disappeared\n\nBut I swore I got a phone call\n\nSo that seemed pretty weird\n\nSo caught up in my own head\n\n\n\nI took a walk down my street\n\nThought I'd find something to eat\n\nBut I headed back immediately\n\n'Cause I'm pretty scared of guns\n\nSo go out and have some fun, let loose\n\nAnd I'll daydream of the noose that took my friend Sean's life\n\n\n\nAnd you thought we wouldn't notice it\n\nIf he had disappeared\n\nBut I swore I got a phone call\n\nSo that seemed pretty weird\n\nSo caught up in my own head\n\n\n\nI let my hair down today\n\nAnd I took a shower for the first time in what felt like weeks\n\nI felt my hair falling out\n\nAnd I felt myself falling down\n\nBut that can't seem to be the reason\n\nI can't sleep when I'm alone\n\nIt's getting better\n\nAnd it's hardly getting worse\n\nIt's hard to think about the things that make it all hurt\n\n\n\nI found myself on the street\n\nYou swore that you would love me\n\nAnd I swore I'd love you too\n\nAnd you'll barely even notice it when I disappear",
