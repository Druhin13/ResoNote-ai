  "lyrics": "Do You remember how Mary was grieving?\r\nHow You wept and she fell at Your feet?\r\nIf it's true that You know what I'm feeling\r\nCould it be that You're weeping with me?\r\nArise, O Lord, and save me\r\nThere's nowhere else to go\r\nYou're always good, always good\r\nSomehow this sorrow is shaping my heart like it should\r\nAnd You're always good, always good\r\nWell it's so hard to know what You're doing\r\nWhy won't You tell it all plain?\r\nBut You said You'd come back on the third day\r\nAnd Peter missed it again and again\r\nSo maybe the answer surrounds us\r\nBut we don't have eyes to see\r\nThat You're always good, always good\r\nThis heartache is moving me closer than joy ever could\r\nAnd You're always good\n\nMy God, my God, be near me\r\nThere's nowhere else to go\r\nAnd Lord, if You can hear me\r\nPlease help Your child to know\r\nThat You're always good, always good\r\nAs we try to believe what is not meant to be understood\r\nWill You help us to trust Your intentions for us are still good\r\n'Cause You laid down Your life\r\nAnd You suffered like I never could\r\nYou're always good, always good\r\nYou're always good, always good",
