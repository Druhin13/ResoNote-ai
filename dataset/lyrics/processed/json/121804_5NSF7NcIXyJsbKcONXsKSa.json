(Let me know)\n\nWould you load the magazine?\n\nWould you let it go?\n\nWhen it bang, is your aim incredible?\n\nHow high will your name be when the credits roll?\n\n\n\nWould you be my killer? (Would you be?)\n\nWhen I'm low, would you be my dealer? (Would you be?)\n\nWould you do it by surprise?\n\nAnd when he turn around, could you look him in his eyes?\n\n\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nWould you stand in front of a bullet?\n\nWhen you hear it go bang, bang\n\nWhen you hear it go bang, bang (When you hear it)\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nIf I put it in your hand, could you pull it?\n\nCould you make it go bang, bang?\n\nCould you make it go bang, bang?\n\nCould you make it?\n\n\n\nBang, bang\n\nBang, bang\n\n\n\nIf you're not afraid of the darkness\n\nI'ma be there 'til the end, love\n\nI promise I'll be there regardless\n\nAnywhere in the world that you end up\n\nI won't ever let 'em take what we have\n\nI could make 'em disappear, if you need that\n\nCatch 'em while they walking home, make 'em see black\n\nNow they gone forever, I don't think they'll ever be back\n\n\n\nAll I ask of you is to be there when the time comes\n\n(When the time comes)\n\nEven if it kills you, baby\n\nDo not hide or run\n\n\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nWould you stand in front of a bullet?\n\nWhen you hear it go bang, bang\n\nWhen you hear it go bang, bang (When you hear it)\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nIf I put it in your hand, could you pull it?\n\nCould you make it go bang, bang?\n\nCould you make it go bang, bang?\n\n\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nWould you stand in front of a bullet?\n\nWhen you hear it go bang, bang\n\nWhen you hear it go bang, bang\n\nWhen you hear it\n\n(Bang, bang)\n\n(Bang, bang)\n\n[*shot*]",
