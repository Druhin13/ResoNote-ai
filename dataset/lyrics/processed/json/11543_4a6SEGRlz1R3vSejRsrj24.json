  "lyrics": "Marry me to the blue sky\r\nBury me in that long last drop of hard rain\r\nMeet me where they stop time\r\nThat's you to me on the shovel that's digging this grave\r\nTill I can waltz on a moonbeam\r\nTill I can find a way to return all tears into wine\n\nI'll hitch my ride to a day dream\n\nCan't unkiss the lips that love is leaving behind\n\n\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\nNo future living in the past\n\nI've seen that hate has done to hop\n\nTomorrow wasn't built to last\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\nHow can I scream, I'm scared to breathe\n\nI wrote each word, you gave the toast\n\nBut we were fire and gasoline\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\n\n\nI set my sails over wheat fields\n\nRode waves of amber let a new sun shine on my face\n\nI dropped the sword, put down my shield\n\nI left your scars for the stars guiding my way\n\nI traded hurting for healing\n\nI must admit that I was reeling\n\nNow I'm feeling just fine\n\nTraded nightmares for dreaming\n\nGo tell your shadows that I got out alive\n\n\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\nNo future living in the past\n\nI've seen what hurt has done to hope\n\nI found the tree I cut the rope\n\nTomorrow wasn't built to last\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\nHow can I scream, I'm scared to breathe\n\nI wrote each word, you gave the toast\n\nBut we were fire and gasoline\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\n\n\nLast night I had this dream\n\nI saw a man wash his feet\n\nIn the church holy water\n\nHe worked up to his knees\n\nFrom his arms to his neck\n\nSaid I'm over in my head\n\nHe was crying trying to get some relief\n\nLord, I'm just trying to get some relief\n\nI had this dream\n\nThat man was me\n\n\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\nNo future living in the past\n\nI've seen what hurt has done to hope\n\nI found the tree I cut the rope\n\nTomorrow wasn't built to last\n\nI ain't living with the ghost\n\nHow can I scream, I'm scared to breathe\n\nI wrote each word, you gave the toast\n\nBut we were fire and gasoline\n\nNow I ain't living with the ghost",
