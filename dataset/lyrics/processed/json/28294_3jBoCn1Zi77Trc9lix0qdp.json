  "lyrics": "You sugarcoat our situation\r\nGot me waiting anticipation\r\nWhen you gonna call, when you gonna call me?\r\nNo double dipping, you got it twisted\r\nI’m not the kinda girl that’s gonna get addicted to vanilla\n\n\n\nYou can’t have it both ways\n\nBoy it’s not your birthday\n\nSo get out, get out\n\n\n\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too\n\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too\n\nAin’t no secret you got a weakness for my sweetness\n\nBut you can’t have your cake and eat it too\n\n\n\nThose other girls taste nothing like me\n\nEat your heart out just like candy\n\nYou’re not gonna call, but I know you want me\n\n\n\nYou can’t have it both ways\n\nBoy it’s not your birthday\n\nSo get out, get out\n\n\n\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too\n\nYou can’t have your cake and eat it too\n\nAin’t no secret you got a weakness for my sweetness\n\nBut you can’t have your cake and eat it too\n\n\n\nI’m gonna blow out all your candles\n\nI’m gonna blow out all your candles",
