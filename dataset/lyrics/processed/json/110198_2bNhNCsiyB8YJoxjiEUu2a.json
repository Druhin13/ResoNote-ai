  "lyrics": "When I was young\r\nI'd listen to the radio\r\nWaitin' for my favorite songs When they played I'd sing along\r\nIt made me smile.\r\nThose were such happy times\n\nAnd not so long ago\n\nHow I wondered where they'd gone\n\nBut they're back again\n\nJust like a long lost friend\n\nAll the songs I loved so well.\n\n\n\nEvery Sha-la-la-la\n\nEvery Wo-o-wo-o\n\nStill shines\n\nEvery shing-a-ling-a-ling\n\nThat they're startin' to sing's\n\nSo fine.\n\n\n\nWhen they get to the part\n\nWhere he's breakin' her heart\n\nIt can really make me cry\n\nJust like before\n\nIt's yesterday once more.\n\n\n\nLookin' back on how it was\n\nIn years gone by\n\nAnd the good times that I had\n\nMakes today seem rather sad\n\nSo much has changed.\n\n\n\nIt was songs of love that\n\nI would sing to then\n\nAnd I'd memorize each word\n\nThose old melodies\n\nStill sound so good to me\n\nAs they melt the years away.\n\n\n\nEvery Sha-la-la-la\n\nEvery Wo-o-wo-o\n\nStill shines\n\nEvery shing-a-ling-a-ling\n\nThat they're startin' to sing's\n\nSo fine.\n\n\n\nAll my best memories\n\nCome back clearly to me\n\nSome can even make me cry.\n\nJust like before\n\nIt's yesterday once more.",
