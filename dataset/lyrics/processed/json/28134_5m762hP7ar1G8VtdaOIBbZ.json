  "lyrics": "My Mama doesn't like it, the way I comb my hair,\rPapa thinks I'm crazy, in the clothes I wear\rIt's a hit come on records and I play it all day\rBut I'm what I am and I'm gonna keep a rockin' that way.\rI'm a rockabilly rebel from head to toe\rI gotta keep a-rockin' everywhere I go\rEverybody join us, we're good company\rBe a real cool cat, be a rockabilly rebel like me.\rThe kids in the schoolhouse they couldn't wait too long,\rWhen the school is over, they put their cat clothes on,\rOughta hear the slap bass swingin' to the band\rIt is a real rockin' rhythm that is sweepin' all over this land\rI'm a rockabilly rebel from head to toe\rI gotta keep a-rockin' everywhere I go\rEverybody join us, we're good company\rBe a real cool cat, be a rockabilly rebel like me.\rSquares get the message get the boppin' beat,\rLet them tramp through your body, to the head to your feet,\rShakin' in your shoes, boy, oh, don't it make you feel wow,\rWell if you can't dance, we're not gonna show you how.\rI'm a rockabilly rebel from head to toe\rI gotta keep a-rockin' everywhere I go\rEverybody join us, we're good company\rBe a real cool cat, be a rockabilly rebel like me.",
