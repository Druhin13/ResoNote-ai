  "lyrics": "You gotta plant your seed\r\nTo watch it grow\r\nI got the secrets locked inside of my mind\r\nThe stories I, never told\r\nI got the deepest devotion\r\nIn the mistiest ocean\n\nOh lover, I’m coming home to you\n\nAnd I'll see it through\n\nI see it through\n\n\n\nBut when the cold game down the line\n\nI heard that the waiting feel was fine\n\nWhy don’t we step into the light\n\n‘Cause it’s going on and on\n\nUntil the break of dawn\n\nAnd every time I call\n\nNobody’s ever really home\n\n\n\nBut I follow\n\nBut I follow\n\nBut I follow\n\nFollow my soul\n\nFollow my soul\n\n‘Cause I'm always gonna know\n\nThe right way to go\n\nBecause the feeling always shows\n\nThe way back home",
