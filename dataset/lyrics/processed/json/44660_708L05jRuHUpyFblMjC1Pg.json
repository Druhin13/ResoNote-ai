  "lyrics": "Mmmmm\r\nMmmmm\r\nMmmmm\r\nMmmmm\r\nBaptized in the beauty of you\n\nCapsized in your swimming pools\n\nRealized that I'm just your tool\n\nCan't hold on to ya hold on to ya, hold on\n\n\n\nCause even though we're born so young\n\nWe been forced to live our faults\n\nBut you can't outrun something you need\n\nIt's been years since I first thought\n\nWhy are we here? Was us so wrong?\n\nCause In this this city another love was lost\n\n\n\n(Mmmmm)\n\n\n\nI'd do anything for you\n\nEven slay all these righteous fools\n\nI swear on my mama to that I'm coming for you\n\nSo just hold on baby hold on baby, hold on\n\n\n\nCause even though we're born so young\n\nWe been forced to live our faults\n\nBut you can't outrun something you need\n\nIt's been years since I first thought\n\nWhy are we here? Was us so wrong?\n\nCause In this this city another love was lost\n\n\n\nI never though I'd say this\n\nBut I would've traveled ages\n\nJust for you\n\nBut we're caught up in our feelings\n\nAnd I think it's just this city\n\n\n\nCause even though we're born so young\n\nWe been forced to live our faults\n\nBut you can't outrun something you need\n\nIt's been years since I first thought\n\nWhy are we here? Was us so wrong?\n\nCause In this this city another love was lost\n\n\n\nI'm just human, I bleed my choices\n\nBut you remain you remain\n\nMaybe our damaged voices could not reach\n\nI yelled to God please hear my cry\n\nI pray my voice could reach up that high\n\nCause in this city another love was lost",
