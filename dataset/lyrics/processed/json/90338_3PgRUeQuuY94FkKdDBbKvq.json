Can't fuck you if you sixteen\n\nDon't mean to be mean, I'm just focused on my green, yeah\n\n\n\nTell me that you want this Novocaine\n\nI don't fuck with niggas talking on my name\n\nYou turned crazy and still I'm the one to blame\n\nTold you, bitch, I got no time, don't fucking wait\n\nI don't move too fast, I got these niggas watching me\n\nTrapped myself inside the basement, bitch, just try to see, ayy\n\nLast night left the crib so full of shame\n\nI don't got no place to put this pain",
