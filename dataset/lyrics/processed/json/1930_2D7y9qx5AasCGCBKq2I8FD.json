  "lyrics": "While out sailing on the ocean\r\nWhile out sailing on the sea\r\nI bumped into the Savior\r\nAnd He said pardon me\r\nI said \"Jesus you look tired\"\r\nHe said \"Jesus so do you,\n\nSit down son\n\n'Cause I got some fat to chew\"\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nEverybody needs somebody that they can talk to\n\nSomeone to open up their ears\n\nAnd let that trouble through\n\nNow you don't have to sympathize\n\nOr care what they may do\n\nBut everybody needs somebody that they can talk to\n\n\n\nWell he spoke to me of morality\n\nStarvation, pain and sin\n\nMatter of fact the whole dang time\n\nI only got a few words in\n\nBut I won't squawk\n\nLet 'em talk\n\nHell it's been a long long time\n\nAnd any friend that's been turned down\n\nIs bound to be a friend of mine\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\n\n\nNow we sat there for an hour or two\n\nJust eatin' that Gospel pie\n\nWhen around the bend come a terrible wind\n\nAnd lightning lit the sky\n\nHe said so long son I gotta run\n\nAppreciate you listening to me\n\nAnd I believe I heard him sing these words\n\nAs he skipped out across the sea\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)",
