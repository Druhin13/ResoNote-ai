  "lyrics": "It ain't a facade, I spent some racks on my shoes\r\nI been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels\r\nI walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo\r\nI get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound\r\nCan't get you off my mind, I might die about you\r\nMy outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move\n\nThe praises to the god, don't believe in voodoo\n\n'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you\n\n\n\nTell everything but the truth, get nothin' but love from my crew\n\nI guess they hate what you do, pull up in coupes with no roofs\n\nYou caught me in a good mood, can't put a spike in my groove\n\nGot more these designer shoes\n\nI drip, I need an award\n\nI built that way for that Porsche, I think I'm on a high horse\n\nYSL, got none' but Hi-Tunes, we kill 'em off, no remorse\n\nI gotta win, I can't lose, I'm tryna feed all my boys\n\nHuh, I paid my dues to these hoes\n\nI got that flame to the torch, young Gunna ball with no court\n\nI hit that trap and quit sports, I give all thanks to the lord\n\nI hit that yo and record, they get that drip from your boy, mmh\n\n\n\nIt ain't a facade, I spent some racks on my shoes\n\nI been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels\n\nI walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo\n\nI get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound\n\nCan't get you off my mind, I might die about you\n\nMy outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move\n\nThe praises to the god, don't believe in voodoo\n\n'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you\n\n\n\nMan bag, guns in 'em\n\nTrack pants, run in 'em\n\nGorilla blue, Godzilla\n\nWe don't fuck with no nigga\n\nHow you want that Saint Laurent bag? You ain't suckin' no dick\n\nMy lil LA bitch got jetlag, she off that coke shit\n\nFuck that shit, come on shawty\n\nFuck that Ghost, where the Rari?\n\nNone of my niggas want to party\n\nThem young niggas want to catch a body\n\nWe ain't wifing no Chiraq thots\n\nThreesome, them my type of thots\n\nVegas bitch tried to sell me pussy\n\nTell that ho like hell no\n\nMain homie's bitch tried to fuck me\n\nAnd she told me he don't know\n\nIf they out they won't say shit\n\n'Cause he know he gon' get peter-rolled\n\nAnd we about the violence, my young niggas be wildin'\n\nYour baby mama be trifling, yeah yeah\n\n\n\nIt ain't a facade, I spent some racks on my shoes\n\nI been goin' hard, I paid all cash for my jewels\n\nI walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo\n\nI get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound\n\nCan't get you off my mind, I might die about you\n\nMy outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move\n\nThe praises to the god, don't believe in voodoo\n\n'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you",
