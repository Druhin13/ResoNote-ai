  "lyrics": "I can see you in my mind, clearly\r\nI can feel you and I am waiting by your side\r\nI see you in my mind, clearly\r\nI can feel you and now I won't forget I’m with you\r\nAll the warmth left in me\n\nI feel it slip away\n\nWhen tomorrow comes at last\n\nWill there be nothing left?\n\n\n\nIf the beats of our hearts were in synchronicity\n\nCould I fall as far you?\n\nCould I feel the pain you do?\n\n\n\nI’m always - I’m always waiting here, at your side\n\nAnd I’ll stay, come what may\n\nEven if the future may take you far away\n\n\n\nAs we drift in a world of night\n\nWe huddle close together, wings tucked in tight\n\nLike little birds that can’t find the strength to fly\n\nWe dream about a wide open sky\n\n\n\nYou who always go hide behindYou who always will hide behind\n\nA smile with your feelings locked up inside\n\nYour eyes are like a blade of unmelting ice\n\nI only wish myI only wish by holding you tight we could stay this way, forever\n\n\n\nKire kagima saibastia\n\nInaria miamenta\n\nAsora ita saibastia\n\nImilia iyasii iya\n\n\n\nAre you going alone?\n\nI feel you slip away\n\nYou can tell me if you’re mad\n\nOrWe’re just just a freedom looking back\n\n\n\nWhen the shade of your heart is so cold it might just crack\n\nThough we go by different names we are very much the same\n\nThere’s a place - Just one place, we will one day return\n\nWe can’t help but to trust in this fleeting feeling that’s captured both of us\n\n\n\nAs we drift in a world of night\n\nWe may be split apart, but that’s quite alright\n\nI’ll find my way to you, ‘cause our hearts, they know\n\nA bond that’s stronger than any stone\n\n\n\nWhen you’re sad, it hurts even me\n\nAnd even when you’re laughing, seeming carefree\n\nI wanna be the warmth to cure your cold touch\n\nI’ll make it be with each falling tear\n\nI am always here, forever\n\n\n\nI can see you in my mind, clearly\n\nI can feel you and now I won't forget I’m with you",
