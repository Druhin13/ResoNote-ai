  "lyrics": "Prey for mercy cause I have ended\r\nAnd I've defended, my immortal place\r\nMy eternal grace will lift through these\r\nBridges burned\r\nI'll take the carnage that you bring me now\n\nI seek nothing but the lessons learned\n\nDeny me courage, deny me apathy\n\nBut I will always journey forward\n\n\n\nSo you see me now\n\nI'm up here and you're down there\n\nDisrupt if you dare\n\nFor an alchemy has awoken\n\n\n\nI have awoken\n\nIn this chosen battlefield you made\n\nDevour, empower\n\nBut you're just making us stronger\n\n\n\nI have bespoken\n\nOf our golden age where we climb\n\nEngage, enrage\n\nBut you're just making us stronger\n\n\n\nForget the perception you take\n\nFor there's another side to it all\n\nCan you proclaim your answers as\n\nLogic, or do you care at all?\n\n\n\nForfeit the peace over one wrong move\n\nThings like this really kick my groove\n\nI have acknowledged what I have been taught\n\nBut I cant run if you don't let me walk\n\n\n\nForfeit the peace over one wrong move\n\nThings like this really kick my groove\n\nI have acknowledged what I have been taught\n\nBut I cant run if you don't let me fucking walk\n\n\n\nSo you see me now\n\nI'm up here and you're down there\n\nDisrupt if you dare\n\nFor an alchemy has awoken\n\n\n\nI have awoken\n\nIn this chosen battlefield you made\n\nDevour, empower\n\nBut you're just making us stronger\n\n\n\nI have bespoken\n\nOf our golden age where we climb\n\nEngage, enrage\n\nBut you're just making us stronger\n\n\n\nSilence them all\n\nMark your rise and their fall\n\nShow them you're more than you\n\nLeft on the shores and rise up tall\n\n\n\nCarve out your name\n\nShow them this is your game\n\nMake them wish they believed you\n\nYou're more than they knew\n\n\n\n(But I can't run if you don't let me fucking walk)\n\n\n\nSo you see me now\n\nI'm up here and you're down there\n\nDisrupt if you dare\n\nFor an alchemy has awoken\n\n\n\nI have awoken\n\nIn this chosen battlefield you made\n\nDevour, empower\n\nBut you're just making us stronger\n\n\n\nI have bespoken\n\nOf our golden age where we climb\n\nEngage, enrage\n\nBut you're just making us stronger\n\n\n\nForfeit the peace over one wrong move\n\nThings like this really kick my groove\n\nI have acknowledged what I have been taught\n\nBut I can't run if you don't let me fucking walk",
