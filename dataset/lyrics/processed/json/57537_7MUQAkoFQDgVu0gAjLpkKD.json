  "lyrics": "On the outskirts of the Rigelworlds, a torn warship falls\nthrough the void.\nA lone survivor, trapped inside the hull, tumbling slowly\nthrough fields\nof asteroids. \"It? s strange, the way things tend to go. One\nmoment you prosper,\n\nthe next you find yourself... waning\".\n\n\n\nImmortal... immortal?\n\nBitter the taste of destiny,\n\nwhat now? Seems like the dark is... calling.\n\n\n\n\" This morning I didn? t foresee what I know now,\n\nthat this day would hold my final moment...\"\n\n\n\nThe vision? s fading, as all is lost into eternal frost.\n\nSo fleeting, the warmth of life.\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm here, the road behind me now.\n\nBended, but not broken, and shed no tears\n\nthough the end is nigh...\"\n\n\n\nWe are made of stardust, creed of celestial life -\n\nthat in our hearts, the breath of dying stars,\n\ntheir embers are in our eyes.\n\nFor the final adventure\n\nnow that old, rigid corpse is left behind.\n\nThe spirit is unbroken - the lust for unseen lands,\n\nthe warriorsoul - the traveller in us all.",
