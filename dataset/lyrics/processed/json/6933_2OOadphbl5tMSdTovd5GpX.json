  "lyrics": "The leaded window opened \nto move the dancing candle flame \nAnd the first Moths of summer \nsuicidal came, suicidal came. \nAnd a new breeze chattered \nin its May-bud tenderness, \n\nSending water-lillies sailing \n\nas she turned to get undressed. \n\nAnd the long night awakened \n\nand we soared on powdered wings, \n\nCircling our tomorrows \n\nin the wary month of Spring. \n\nChasing shadows slipping \n\nin a magic lantern slide, \n\nCreatures of the candle \n\non a night-light-ride. \n\nDipping and weaving \n\nFlutter through the golden needle's eye \n\nin our haystack madness. \n\nButterfly-stroking on a Spring-tide high. \n\nLife's too long (as the Lemming said) \n\nas the candle burned and the Moths were wed. \n\nAnd we'll all burn together as the wick grows higher \n\nbut before the candle's dead. \n\nThe leaded window opened \n\nto move the dancing candle flame. \n\nAnd the first moths of summer \n\nsuicidal came, oh, suicidal came. \n\nTo join in the worship \n\nof the light that never dies \n\nin a moment's reflection \n\nof two moths spinning in her eyes.",
