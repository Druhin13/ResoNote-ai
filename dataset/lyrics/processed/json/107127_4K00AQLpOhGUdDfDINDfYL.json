  "lyrics": "I wrote you a letter\r\nTo make myself feel better\r\nTo redeem some part of me\r\nI thought I had lost\r\nAnd we were a lost cause\r\nLong before we fell apart\n\n'Cause honey, I was too eager\n\nAnd you were too smart\n\nAnd I look for you\n\nIn these empty rooms\n\nYou're a phone call away\n\nI'm on the interstate\n\nAnd I've been drinking cheap wine\n\nJust to pass the time\n\nI'm falling behind\n\nAnd it doesn't matter\n\nWho you are to me\n\n\n\nWell I'm just like my mother\n\nWe both love to run\n\nChase impossible things\n\nOr unreachable dreams\n\nLie awake in the night\n\nThinking this can't be right\n\nBut there is no other way\n\nTo live a life alone\n\nI'm alone now\n\n\n\nThen suddenly we wake from this dream that we have made\n\nIt hits you all at once and then it slowly fades\n\nI'm raising in to nothing now, it all falls away\n\nI know it now for my own sake that I cannot stay",
