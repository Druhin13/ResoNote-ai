  "lyrics": "When I was just a boy at school\r\nThe kids all said that I was cool.\r\nEven said I could go far, just me and my guitar.\r\nI combed my hair in a big El quiff,\r\nLots of grease to make it stiff,\r\nMy pointed toes and my boot-lace tie -\n\nI'm going to catch your eye.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, rock and roll -\n\nI can't stop, it's got a hold.\n\nHey, hey, what I say?\n\nAin't nobody gonna take it away.\n\n\n\nI met a girl and she could sing -\n\nShe could do most anything.\n\nWhen I took her in my car, she just wanted my guitar.\n\nSo I put my foot hard down,\n\nLeft her standing in that old town.\n\nAin't nobody going to come between\n\nMe and my machine.\n\n\n\nWoah, oh, rock and roll -\n\nI can't stop, it's got a hold.\n\nHey, hey, what I say?\n\nAin't nobody gonna take it away.\n\n\n\nThen one day I took a ride\n\nInto the city and the bright lights.\n\nI soon found out that I was on my own,\n\njust picking at the bone.\n\nJust one thing for me to do -\n\nI had to make it up and anew,\n\nSo I picked up my faithful friend\n\nAnd I played it to the end.\n\n\n\nOh, oh, rock and roll -\n\nI can't stop, it's got a hold.\n\nHey, hey, what I say?\n\nAin't nobody gonna take it away",
