  "lyrics": "I've come back this morning\r\nTo where I first came alive\r\nHere within this terminal\r\nWhere the buses arrive\r\nI was a commuter on the 804\r\nWorked for a computer\n\nOn the 19th floor and\n\n\n\nYou came down the aisle of the bus\n\nAnd you sat by my side\n\nShoulder up to shoulder\n\nWe shared that 9 o'clock ride\n\nOh my heart was screaming\n\nAs you left your seat\n\nFollowing your movements\n\nI was at your feet and\n\n\n\nOh... down into the terminal\n\nBoth of us smiled\n\nSo... we entered the terminal\n\nJust as you smiled\n\n\n\n\"Won't you leave out work for today?\"\n\nYou asked of me then\n\nSo I phoned in sick on the way\n\nTo the home of a friend\n\nWe were all alone from 10 a.m. till 3\n\nReally thought the fire\n\nHad gone out of me but\n\n\n\nYou awoke the sleep of my life\n\nFrom gray into red\n\nMade the weary wonder of Wall Street\n\nRise from the dead\n\nCould have held up\n\nBudding my entire life\n\nBut I had to get home\n\nTo the kids and the wife and so\n\n\n\nI left for the terminal where I began\n\nBaby no, I wouldn't have left\n\nIf I'd been half a man\n\n\n\nSo here I am this morning\n\nWhere love had asked for the dance\n\nHere within this terminal\n\nWhere I passed on the chance\n\nLord I'll never find her\n\nThough I've truly tried\n\nProbably she's found another\n\nBus to ride and\n\n\n\nI am now about to begin\n\nThe last of my days\n\nI'm within what others\n\nWould call a terminal phase\n\nI myself can only say it's livin' dead\n\nRiding to the office with\n\nA song in my head that goes...\n\n\n\nLa da da...\n\nAnd you know it grows\n\nLa da da...",
