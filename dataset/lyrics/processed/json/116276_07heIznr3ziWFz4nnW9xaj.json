  "lyrics": "I'm out the door, I left a note\r\nWith all the words that made me choke\r\nIt says \"I know you feel alone\r\nYou're scared to death, I'm letting go\"\r\nSometimes you have to lose it all\r\nTo find yourself across the world\n\nFrom no one else safe for you\n\nBut one more word before I go\n\nI'm scared to death, I'm scared to die alone\n\n\n\nI'm out the door to chase what I've been searching for\n\nThe spaces in between us grow\n\nYou'll never know\n\nI'm scared to death of letting go\n\nSo take [?] seconds apart\n\nMy heart needs a break, it's an honest mistake\n\nUntil I find my way back\n\nHelp me find my way back\n\n\n\nAnd bring me home\n\nI'm not ready to believe\n\nThat we were meant for this collision\n\nAnd it's just not what I need\n\nSo bring me home\n\nIf I make it back\n\nIf I make it back maybe you can be the reason\n\nAnd fix this part of me\n\nCause it's just not what I need\n\n\n\nCan you fix this part of me\n\nThis part of me\n\n\n\nIt's not living if I'm not living with you\n\nIt's not living if I'm not living with you\n\nIt's not living if I'm not living with you\n\nIt's not living if I'm not living with you\n\n\n\nBring me home\n\nI'm not ready to believe\n\nThat we were meant for this collision\n\nAnd it's just not what I need\n\nSo bring me home\n\nIf I make it back\n\nIf I make it back maybe you can be the reason\n\nAnd fix this part of me\n\nCause it's just not what I need\n\nSo bring me home\n\n\n\nIt's not living if I'm not living with you\n\nThere you go!",
