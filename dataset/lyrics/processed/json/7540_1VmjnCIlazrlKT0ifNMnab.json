  "lyrics": "How many lightbulbs does it take to change the mood?\r\nIf that's how many did, I think I'm screwed\r\nAnd how many problems can you fit in your limousine?\r\nLet's take 'em 'round the back to the cash machine\r\nAnd if my eyes open for business\n\nOr my heart comes home for Christmas\n\nThen I will take you surfing in the sky\n\nNo, I can't walk on water\n\nAnd if you've ever wondered why\n\nLemme take you surfing in the sky\n\n\n\nWhat do you get when you cross the Rubicon?\n\nWith a man who said self-humor's all gone?\n\nYou tell them the one about the one that gets away\n\nSo when you take your shot and there's no one left to play\n\n\n\nAnd you've got nothing left to give\n\nI'll give you a month to live\n\nAnd I will take you surfing in the sky\n\nTo keep you out of reach of every other guy\n\nI will take you surfing in the sky\n\nWoah\n\n\n\nI was made to measure\n\nThe sauciest way to pleasure\n\nSo I can take you surfing in the sky\n\nSome say \"hallelujah\"\n\nAnd some are even high\n\nSo baby let's go surfing in the sky\n\nBaby let's go surfing in the sky\n\nBaby let's go surfing in the sky",
