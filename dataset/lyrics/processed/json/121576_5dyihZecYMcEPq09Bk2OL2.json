  "lyrics": "Could have been my happy ever after\r\nLiving like we're in a fairy tale\r\nBut you and me were more like a disaster\r\nI should have known\r\nIntoxicated by your reputation\r\nI can see the mischief in your eyes\n\nTrusted you despite my reservations\n\nNow I’m alone\n\n\n\nI was so rich with all this love\n\nYou wanted it and I was so dumb\n\nI let you in when I should have run\n\nNow all that's left is something numb\n\n\n\nI gave you all I had to lose\n\nMy skin, my soul, my finest jewels\n\nYou stole it all for someone new and then\n\nYou gave away the best of me\n\nMy sins, my sweetest ecstasy\n\nTo someone worth much less than me\n\nYeah, you're my Robin Hood\n\n\n\nEverybody says that you’re so great, yeah\n\nWalk around like you deserve that gold\n\nBut what would happen if they knew the place that\n\nYou got it from?\n\nI guess that I was just another victim\n\nSomeone that you thought that you could play\n\nI had a feeling and I should have listened\n\nNow there's no us\n\n\n\nI was so rich with all this love\n\nYou wanted it and I was so dumb\n\nI let you in when I should have run\n\nNow all that's left is something numb\n\n\n\nI gave you all I had to lose\n\nMy skin, my soul, my finest jewels\n\nYou stole it all for someone new and then\n\nYou gave away the best of me\n\nMy sins, my sweetest ecstasy\n\nTo someone worth much less than me\n\nYeah, you're my Robin Hood\n\n\n\nSo alone, so alone\n\nSo alone, so alone\n\n\n\nI gave you all I had to lose\n\nMy skin, my soul, my finest jewels\n\nYou stole it all for someone new and then\n\nYou gave away the best of me\n\nMy sins, my sweetest ecstasy\n\nTo someone worth much less than me\n\nYeah, you're my Robin Hood",
