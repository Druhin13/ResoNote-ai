  "lyrics": "Doggy abandonned, hair shining, speckled; baring its fangs to the crowd\r\n\"I tried to avoid it\" said lady in slippers \"they came and they barked on my grounds\"\r\nOh well gather the squad\r\nAnd meet their drastic dentures\r\nBark in their mouths now\n\nLick on their greasy wigs\n\n\n\nWhoosh Fountain of slobber\n\nPretty thin gestures they have\n\nYou get down on your knees and you crawl to the floor so I can pet you and bite you hard\n\n\n\nI can feel your skin scratching from the wounds\n\nI will lick the crust itching through the ditch\n\n\n\nDown on all fours, FANGS OUT\n\nDown on all fours, FANGS OUT\n\nDown on all fours, FANGS OUT\n\nDown on all fours, FANGS OUT\n\nDown on all fours, FANGS OUT\n\nDown on all fours, FANGS OUT\n\n\n\nI’ll make you scream now oh oh MAKE YOU BLEED now\n\nI’ll lick your wounds now off off NOW SIT\n\nSIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT\n\n\n\nShout out to those dogs\n\nCounting the days days\n\nWaiting to jump on the first guy who’s bleeding up to death\n\n\n\nCounting up days days\n\nItching your bruise, bruises\n\nWatching you bleed and jerk off like that's what you always wanted\n\n\n\nDown on all fours, fangs out\n\nDown on all fours, fangs out\n\nDown on all fours, fangs out\n\nDown on all fours, fangs out\n\nFangs out\n\n\n\nI can feel your skin scratching from the wounds\n\nI will lick the crust itching through the ditch\n\nI can feel your skin scratching from the wounds\n\nI will lick the crust itching through the ditch",
