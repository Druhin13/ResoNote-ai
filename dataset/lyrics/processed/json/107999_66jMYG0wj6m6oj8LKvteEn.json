  "lyrics": "All the kids run around playing free and fun\r\nWhile the dogs lap around the can\r\nFalling down, climbing trees, swimming in the river\r\nNo life jacket on their backs\r\nDaughters sharpen their knives and they hunt for food\r\nOthers watch their children grow\n\nMothers going to work and they shake the hands of a corporate tycoon's ghost\n\n\n\nAnd I'm afraid\n\nAh, I'm so afraid\n\nAh, what if I lose?\n\nIs what I think to myself\n\nI'm finding my shell\n\nI'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you\n\n\n\nI'm a gift and a curse to the wilderness\n\nWhen the leaves only turn to brown\n\nThe birds fly high and they wink at all of the grandmothers on the ground\n\nRain pours down in the village dens\n\nMy cousins fetch for lunch\n\nWhile I sit in my room writing letters to my church and things and such\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm afraid\n\nAh, I'm so afraid\n\nAh, what if I lose?\n\nIs what I think to myself\n\nI'm finding my shell\n\nI'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you\n\n\n\nCousins all in the creek\n\n[?]\n\nAnd the rain pours down, the ghetto dancin’, yeah\n\n\n\nI'm so afraid\n\nAh, I'm so afraid\n\nAh, what if I lose?\n\nIs what I think to myself\n\nI'm finding my shell\n\nI'm afraid of it all, afraid of loving you\n\nI'm afraid, afraid of loving you\n\n\n\nCousins all in the creek\n\n[?]\n\nAnd the rain pours down, the ghetto dancin’, yeah",
