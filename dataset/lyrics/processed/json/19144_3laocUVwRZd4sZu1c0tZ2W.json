  "lyrics": "Stuck in Nickel City on the tainted side of a coin\r\nEl Ni√±o brought a blizzard, the Greyhound brought a boy\r\nThose yellow city lights accent the gutters and the rats\r\nOnly the cheap motels were open, wrong side of the tracks\r\nTwo cold nights in Buffalo\n\nOn the way to see you\n\nOutside town, all the roads are closed\n\nGonna wash this rust belt new\n\n\n\nSnowy prison out on Main Street, heaters hang from the cells\n\nA bum searches for shelter, so cold he dreams of hell\n\nIt's that American Dream dying, I hear the whispers of each ghost\n\nOf a wealthy man who once died in downtown Buffalo\n\n\n\nTwo cold nights in Buffalo\n\nOn the way to see you\n\nOutside town, all the roads are closed\n\nGonna wash this rust belt new\n\nGonna wash it new\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the middle class, mom-and-pop, five-and-dimes?\n\nSoon they'll be knocking it all down to build that high-rise\n\nWhat happened to the good old boys rollin' dice in the street?\n\nWhat happened to the neighborhood and the neighbors who had moved?\n\nWhat happened to recreation? That old roller skating rink?\n\nWhat happened to preserving this town's history?\n\n\n\nTwo cold nights in Buffalo\n\nOn the way to see you\n\nOutside town, all the roads are closed\n\nGonna wash this rust belt new\n\nGonna wash it new",
