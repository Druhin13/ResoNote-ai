  "lyrics": "I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I’m not enough\r\nEvery single lie that tells me I will never measure up\r\nAm I more than just the sum of every high and every low?\r\nRemind me once again just who I am, because I need to know, o-ooh\r\nYou say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing\n\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\n\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\n\nWhen I don’t belong, oh you say I am yours\n\nAnd I believe, oh I believe\n\nWhat You say of me\n\nI believe\n\n\n\nThe only thing that matters now is everything You think of me\n\nIn You I find my worth, in You I find my identity, o-ooh\n\n\n\nYou say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing\n\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\n\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\n\nWhen I don’t belong, oh you say I am yours\n\nAnd I believe, oh I believe\n\nWhat You say of me\n\nOh, I believe\n\n\n\nTaking all I have and now I'm laying it at Your feet\n\nYou have every failure God, and You'll have every victory, o-ooh\n\n\n\nYou say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing\n\nYou say I am strong when I think I am weak\n\nYou say I am held when I am falling short\n\nWhen I don’t belong, oh you say I am yours\n\nAnd I believe, oh I believe\n\nWhat You say of me\n\nI believe\n\n\n\nOh I believe, yes I believe\n\nWhat You say of me\n\nOh I believe",
