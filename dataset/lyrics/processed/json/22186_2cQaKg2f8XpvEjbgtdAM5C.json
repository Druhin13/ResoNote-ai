  "lyrics": "Medusa stare, my guns bust in silence\nI'm a black vigilante killer, pro violence\nIt's the rebirth, born again\nRise through the vinyl spin\nThey took out Starks but the light shines within\nIt's the almighty rise of the murderous Ghostface\n\nBodies dropped in Owls, left a cold case\n\nColombian neckties from a black Gambino\n\nBodies get dumped in the black El Camino\n\nIt's Reno, gangster wars, money, power, respect\n\nRevenge is felt like the heat from a tec\n\nTommy guns are irrelevant, I'm bulletproof now\n\nI could fly through the air and duck your chick-a-pow\n\nBlack superhero, crime boss arch nemesis\n\nGood vs. Evil since the first book of Genesis\n\nBattle to the end that's the way of the thriller\n\nAnd Starks is reborn as the Ghostface KILLAH\n\nNo one could get iller\n\n\n\nMurders, bodies chopped into ziplocks\n\nKill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks\n\nCrime boss, I call warn the DeLucas\n\nWatch my eyes turn red, I got a squad full of shooters\n\nMurder, murder, kill, kill, kill\n\nWhen the gas start to hum I put the spark to your grill\n\n\n\nLate night, stuck in the limo\n\nHogtie the capo all up,\n\nBeheaded the driver\n\nLeft the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor\n\nRaw dog, spit in her mouth, disappear in a swarm of killer bees\n\nCripple 'em from they knees, take they legs out (Nigga you know the steez!)\n\nI'm a nighthawk, eagle eye, power of mind control\n\nFaster than the speed of light, you catch a big hole\n\nRuthless, six bodies hung in the meat room\n\nThe butcher shop, I call it the body shop\n\nStart from the bottom, killin' all the way to the top\n\nCarve my name in your skin, pull a stocking mask over your face for recognition\n\nNo time for remission, attack till there's no one left in the position\n\nThe return of the worst case scenario, uh\n\nGhostface attacks on land and now aerial\n\n\n\nMurders, bodies chopped into ziplocks\n\nKill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks\n\nCrime boss, I call warn the DeLucas\n\nWatch my eyes turn red, I got a squad full of shooters\n\nMurder, murder, kill, kill, kill\n\nWhen the gas start to hum I put the spark to your grill",
