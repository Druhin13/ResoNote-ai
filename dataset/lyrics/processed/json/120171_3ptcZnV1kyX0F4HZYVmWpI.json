  "lyrics": "(I), told you your nigga wasn't gon' be 'bout it, didn't I? (I)\r\nSome new love you found, but I see you found yourself without it (I)\r\nWe all gotta learn them lessons (I)\r\nAll good 'til you miscount blessings (I)\r\nAnd that pretty body got you a ring\r\nI told you that pussy ain't everything (I)\n\nDidn't I tell you that we'd probably never get this back? (I)\n\nAnd all that searchin' for what's perfect just set your ass back (I)\n\nTold you what it was (I), told you what it be (I)\n\nTold you what would happen if you ran that game on me (I)\n\nMade a whole album about you niggas won't ever hear (I)\n\nLoved you like cooked food, but you had no clue, did you? (I)\n\nI fell in love again without you\n\nHeard you back livin' alone, I wouldn't doubt it\n\nI swore that I couldn't live without you\n\nJust when you thought that I couldn't live without you\n\n\n\nOh Nikki, Nikki, I've known you so long\n\nYou went and did what felt right, just admit you were dead wrong\n\nYou told me to standby, I told you to come home\n\nYou told me to do me, and I'm still goin'\n\n\n\nOh, Nicole\n\nMy Nicole\n\nMy life changed and you changed\n\nAnd we changed and just like that, gone\n\nDon't sit there, girl, say somethin' to me (Hello?)\n\n\n\nOh Nikki, Nikki, I've known you so long\n\nYou went and did what felt right, just admit you were dead wrong\n\nYou told me to standby, I told you to come home\n\nYou told me to do me, and I'm still goin'\n\n\n\nOh, Nicole\n\nMy Nicole\n\nMy life changed and you changed\n\nAnd we changed and just like that, gone\n\nDon't sit there, girl (Answer me)",
