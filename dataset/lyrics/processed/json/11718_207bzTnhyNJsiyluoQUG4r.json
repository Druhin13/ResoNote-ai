  "lyrics": "I had a dream I was a river boat captain on the Brazos queen\r\n3 piece suit, top hat, diamond cuff links\r\nThey came from up and down the river yeah just to kiss the ring\r\nOf the man with his hand on the wheel of the Brazos queen\r\nYeah and you were there too\n\nBut you weren't impressed\n\nYou were laughing at me\n\nI guess you couldn't care less\n\n\n\nIf I could move a mountain\n\nIf I could part the sea\n\nIf I could walk on water\n\nI still couldn't make you love me\n\n\n\nI had a vision I was sitting on a pile of Spanish gold\n\nThat me and Smith and Wesson took off back in Mexico\n\nWhen the smoke finally cleared I rode as fast as a horse could go\n\nHeading straight for the sun with a pile of Spanish gold\n\n\n\nI brought it all to you\n\nBut you weren't impressed\n\nYou just laughed at me\n\nLike you couldn't care less\n\n\n\nIf I could move a mountain\n\nIf I could part the sea\n\nIf I could walk on water\n\nI still couldn't make you love me\n\nMake you love me\n\n\n\nWhen I woke up I was lying in a pool of sweat\n\nI'd been hanging on a cross, holes in both my hands\n\nYeah and you were there too\n\nBut you couldn't care less\n\n\n\nI could move a mountain\n\nYeah I could part the sea\n\nYeah I could walk on water\n\nBut I still couldn't make-\n\nI could move a mountain\n\nYeah I could part the sea\n\nWhoa I could walk on water\n\nBut I still couldn't make you love me\n\nYeah I couldn't make you love me",
