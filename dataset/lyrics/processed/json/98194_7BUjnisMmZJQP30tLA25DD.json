  "lyrics": "Been to Paris, LA and New York\r\nI still haven't found what I want\r\nAnd nothing compares to your love\r\nSo what are we waiting for? Ooh\r\nI had my reasons, love without meaning\n\nWe all got demons, trust me I've seen 'em\n\nYou had your reasons, caught up in feelings\n\nWouldn't believe it, said you were leaving\n\n\n\nAnd now we're fucked up but you give me good vibes\n\nSomething real, I forgot what it feels like\n\nThem late nights, cheap thrills and them fake highs\n\nMade me realize I want something real\n\n\n\nI've been to Paris, LA and New York\n\nI still haven't found what I want\n\nAnd nothing compares to your love\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Ooh\n\nBeen to Paris, LA and New York\n\nThere's beauty behind every door\n\nBut nothing compares to yours\n\nSo what are we waiting for?\n\n\n\nI'm never gonna leave my, leave my love\n\nI'm never gonna leave my, leave my love\n\nThere's nothing in this world that I want more\n\nI'm never gonna leave my, leave my love\n\n\n\nAnd now we're fucked up but you give me good vibes\n\nSomething real, I forgot what it feels like\n\nThem late nights, cheap thrills and them fake highs\n\nMade me realize I want something real\n\n\n\nI've been to Paris, LA and New York\n\nI still haven't found what I want\n\nAnd nothing compares to your love\n\nSo what are we waiting for? (So what are we waiting for?)\n\nBeen to Paris, LA and New York\n\nThere's beauty behind every door\n\nBut nothing compares to yours\n\nSo what are we waiting for? Ooh ooh\n\nSo what are we waiting for?\n\n\n\nOoh",
