  "lyrics": "I feel nervous in a way that can't be named\r\nI dreamt last night of a sign that read, \"the end of love\"\r\nAnd I remember thinking\r\nEven in my dreaming it was a good line for a song\r\nWe're a family pulled from a flood\n\nYou tore the floorboards up\n\nAnd let the river rush in\n\nNot wash away, wash away\n\n\n\nWe were reaching in the dark\n\nThat summer in New York\n\nAnd it was so far to fall\n\nBut it didn't hurt at all\n\nAnd let it wash away, wash away\n\n\n\nAnd in a moment of joy and fury I threw myself\n\nFrom the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me\n\nI've always been in love with you\n\nCould you tell it from the moment that I met you?\n\n\n\nWe're a family pulled from a flood\n\nYou tore the floorboards up\n\nAnd let the river rush in\n\nNot wash away, wash away\n\n\n\nWe were reaching in the dark (wash away)\n\nThat summer in New York (wash away)\n\nAnd was it so far to fall (wash away)\n\nSaid it didn't hurt at all\n\nAnd let it wash away, wash away\n\n\n\nAnd Joshua came down from the mountain\n\nWith a tablet in his hands\n\nTold me that he loved me, yeah\n\nAnd then ghosted me again\n\n\n\nWe were reaching in the dark\n\nThat summer in New York\n\nAnd it was so far to fall\n\nBut it didn't hurt at all\n\nI let it wash away, wash away\n\nReaching in the dark (wash away)\n\nThat summer in New York (wash away)\n\nAnd was it so far to fall (wash away)\n\nSaid it didn't hurt at all\n\nAnd let it wash away, wash away",
