  "lyrics": "This is the end of Side One of this record\r\nPlease now turn it over for the second side\r\nI got a phone that won't die\r\nYou're up in the air, landing tonight\r\nSo I'll leave a message for ya, get it when you touch down\n\nIf I'm being honest, I'm a little drunk now\n\nI got a bed that's too big without ya\n\nI got a heart that don't beat without ya\n\nGuess I'm jealous when you ain't my beside\n\nI know it's selfish, but I need you tonight\n\n\n\nSo text when you touch down, straight to my place now\n\nThese nights without you, they're so hard to sleep\n\nCome put your things down, I'll order take out\n\nNo more to say now, baby, just make out with me\n\nBaby, just make out with me\n\n\n\nYou got a kiss I still taste\n\nAnd I feel your lips from miles away\n\nI got one more minute of this message to burn\n\nI hope you get it 'cause I mean every word\n\n\n\nSo text when you touch down, straight to my place now\n\nThese nights without you, they're so hard to sleep\n\nCome put your things down, I'll order take out\n\nNo more to say now, baby, just make out with me\n\nBaby, just make out with me\n\nJust like it used to be, baby, just make out with me",
