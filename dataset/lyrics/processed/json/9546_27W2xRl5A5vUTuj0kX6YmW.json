  "lyrics": "Am I obsessing over thinking too much?\r\n'Cause I'm finding it hard to breathe\r\nYou think I'm a feral, I'm a wild thing\r\nAnd it could be the end of me\r\nSo overpressure, I'm applying too much\n\n'Cause I'm sweeping you off your feet\n\nYou give me the thing I like, a foul thing [?]\n\nOf these matters, I'm allowed to be\n\n\n\nDid you think this was ever the deal?\n\nNo, I can't tell if you're being real\n\nI am sick, so fed up, I am done\n\nYeah, I suffered enough\n\n\n\nI'm nothing but lovesick\n\n'Cause nothing makes sense when I'm not with you\n\nI'm nothing but honest\n\nI wanna give up, giving up on you\n\nI'm nothing but lovesick\n\n\n\nYou're a confession, you're a lot like a crush\n\nBut the problem is not discreet\n\nSay you got a medical condition\n\nEither that, or you can't take the heat\n\n\n\nSo what's the question, am I not a lost cause?\n\n'Cause I'm walking a one way street\n\nI can touch the ceiling with my fingers\n\nBut I am stuck under your feet\n\n\n\nDid you think this was ever the deal?\n\nNo, I can't tell if you're being real\n\nI am sick, so fed up, I am done\n\nYeah, I suffered enough\n\n\n\nI'm nothing but lovesick\n\n'Cause nothing makes sense when I'm not with you\n\nI'm nothing but honest\n\nI wanna give up, giving up on you\n\nI'm nothing but lovesick\n\nI'm nothing but love-lovesick\n\n\n\nI'm opening your eyes\n\nSo go with it, go with it, go with it now\n\nLike you have open mine\n\nSo go with it, go with it, go with it now\n\n\n\nI'm nothing but love-lovesick\n\n'Cause nothing makes sense when I'm not with you\n\nI'm nothing but honest\n\nI wanna give up, giving up on you\n\nI'm nothing but love-lovesick\n\nI'm nothing but love-lovesick",
