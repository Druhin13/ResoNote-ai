  "lyrics": "Remember when ninth grade was about gettin' laid\r\nSkippin' class tryin' not to get caught?\r\nNow you gotta take a test in a bullet proof vest\r\nScared to death that you might get shot\r\nIt's like I just closed my eyes\r\nEverybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise\n\nThat hides behind the lines\n\nThat hide the truth and I just can't take it no more\n\n\n\nSo wake me up from this American bad dream\n\nIs it this messed up, or is it really reality?\n\nI'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy\n\nSomebody wake me up from this American bad dream\n\nFrom this American bad dream\n\n\n\nI remember goin' 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket\n\nJust an inconvenience gettin' stopped\n\nBad cops played the jury, made the good ones worry\n\nAbout showin' up and doin' their job\n\nIt's like I just closed my eyes\n\nEverybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise\n\nThat hides behind the lines\n\nThat hide the truth now I just can't take it no more\n\n\n\nSo wake me up from this American bad dream\n\nIs it this messed up, or is it really reality?\n\nI'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy\n\nSomebody wake me up from this American bad dream\n\nYeah this American bad dream\n\nFrom this American bad dream, oh\n\n\n\nIt's like I just closed my eyes\n\nEverybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise\n\nDamn\n\n\n\nSo wake me up from this American bad dream\n\nIs it this messed up, or is it really reality?\n\nI'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy\n\nSomebody wake me up from this American bad dream\n\nFrom this American bad dream\n\nWake me up, wake me up\n\nWake me up from this American bad dream\n\nFrom this American bad dream",
