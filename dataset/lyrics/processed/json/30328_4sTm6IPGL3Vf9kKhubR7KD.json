  "lyrics": "I can't have fun while you're not having fun\r\nAnd you don't seem to have much fun when I'm around\r\nAnd you tell me all of my jokes ain't that funny\r\nAnd that may be so, but I know your mama loves me\r\nOh, have you forgotten how to say please\n\nYou're so mean to me\n\n\n\nI waste my time Friday nights getting ready\n\nAnd try recreate the first date that you met me\n\nAnd you come around from the town of complacence\n\nAnd eat all my food, drink my booze, test my patience\n\n\n\nHave you forgotten how to say please\n\nYou're so mean to me\n\nAnd I can be rotten but I slowly gotta please\n\nAnd you're so mean to me\n\nOh, you're so mean to me\n\n\n\nI can't have fun while you're not having fun\n\nAnd you don't seem to have much fun when I'm around\n\nAnd you tell me all of my jokes ain't that funny\n\nAnd that may be so, but I know your mama loves me\n\n\n\nOh, have you forgotten how to say please\n\nYou're so mean to me\n\nAnd I can be rotten but I slowly gotta please\n\nAnd you're so mean to me\n\nOh, you're so mean to me",
