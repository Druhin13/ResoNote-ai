  "lyrics": "If my pride was aside, I probably would text you first\r\nBut, If you could die from a broken heart you would drive a hearse\r\n'Cause, every guy that has ever found you attractive and acted on it\r\nBack pedals much after, that's when you've shown your worth\r\nAnd I heard you love NBA niggas and now\r\nYou could track how much them niggas make and make rounds\n\nAt the All-Star break of day or so by Valentine's\n\nSo my advice if shorty doesn't know the game, she gamin' y'all\n\nAnd this Valentine's, dollar signs have you satisfied\n\nThe Gold's Peak add a Rollie and FASHIONNOVA ad\n\nAnd that don't mean to talk to you like a hoe 'cause nah\n\nWe both do what we want but if I want you\n\nI must want you bad, right\n\n\n\nJust sayin', right\n\nYour friends all gettin' married but yeah right\n\nIt's scary, right\n\nThat's real life\n\nYou might just catch you a spirit, you prayin' right\n\n\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's\n\nI don't believe in\n\n\n\nLook, pardon this pessimistic message I'm representin'\n\nYes yes, I know this bitch, I mean woman, I was gettin' reckless\n\nBut hol' up, lemme get one second, I spent so much at Fendi\n\nShe know I'm cool with Robyn, she bother me for the Fenty yeah\n\nI'm tryna block the part of my heart that thrives on your affection\n\nYou tried the love, it's not enough, it's cars, it's money, attention\n\nBut, I'm way too flawed to judge you and I do my part to push you\n\nFarther and farther from me, from my broads and all my problems\n\nShe say, \"look 'Le, I'm sorry, my plane leaves in the mornin'\n\nI'm trying to hit some parties and Staples for the performances\n\nMaybe I'll see you Monday, thanks for this box of chocolates and\n\nRoses you hold before me but court seats could get me 40\n\nThousand likes on my IG, someone I like just invited me\n\nPlus I'm not even wifey, plus you 5'9, he's a giant no\n\nBaby mama, I might could just make a blog and get popular\n\nSo the 14th was for us but fame and fortune excites me\n\nMy Valentine\"\n\n\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's (and I heard you love NBA niggas and now)\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's (an I heard you love NBA niggas and now)\n\nI don't believe in Valentine's\n\nYou ever lost your main jawn to a point guard or a small forward?\n\nI don't believe in\n\nI find it funny Cupid's busiest days is four days before the All-Star\n\nIt was fun while it lasted\n\nI don't believe in",
