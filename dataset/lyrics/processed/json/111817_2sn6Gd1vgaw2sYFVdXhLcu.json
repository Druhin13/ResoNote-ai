  "lyrics": "She turns to water, she goes slippin' through the cracks\r\nAnd all that you gave her, you’ll never win back\r\nYou circled the sun, you wore your wings in all black\r\nSee, I been down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down\r\nBut now I’m back\n\nThose bright crooked stars, man they’re howlin' out\n\nThought you read them all right, had them all figured out\n\nLearned every constellation, just to find where you’re at\n\nYeah, I been gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone\n\nBut now I’m back\n\n\n\nHope was a word, just a glimmer of the blade\n\nMan, how it sang like an old serenade\n\nFill it up, fill it up, this cup's so clear\n\nSee, I’ve been down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, mmm\n\nI’ve been down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, mmm\n\nBut now I'm here",
