  "lyrics": "Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me\r\nWith my mind\r\nPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning\r\nAll the time\r\nAll day long, I think of things, but nothing seems\r\nTo satisfy\n\nThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something\n\nTo pacify\n\n\n\nCan you help me\n\nOccupy my brain?\n\nOh, yeah!\n\n\n\nI need someone to show me the things in life\n\nThat I can't find\n\nI can't see the things that make true happiness\n\nI must be blind\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh\n\nAnd I will cry\n\nHappiness, I cannot feel and love, to me\n\nIs so unreal\n\nAnd so, as you hear these words telling you now\n\nOf my state\n\nI tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could\n\nBut it's too late",
