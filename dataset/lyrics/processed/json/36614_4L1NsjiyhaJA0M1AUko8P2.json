  "lyrics": "A child begins with one single step\r\nThen walks a million miles\r\nAnd though these wings are not ready yet\r\nI will try to fly.\r\nMy eyes can't see,\n\nMy arms can't reach,\n\nI need strength when I'm weak,\n\nI need your faith in me.\n\n\n\nDon't walk in front of me;\n\nI was not born to follow.\n\nDon't walk behind me;\n\nWe were all born to lead.\n\nDon't walk without me;\n\nI might need you tomorrow.\n\nWalk right beside me,\n\nBe the real friend I need.\n\n\n\nIf you take small stones, one at a time,\n\nYou will move that whole mountain.\n\nIf you climb each rainbow,\n\nIt's gold that you'll find\n\nAnd shelter from the rain.\n\n\n\nMy ears can't hear,\n\nMy heart can't feel,\n\nI need strength when I'm weak,\n\nI need your faith in me.\n\n\n\nDon't walk in front of me;\n\nI was not born to follow.\n\nDon't walk behind me;\n\nWe were all born to lead.\n\nDon't walk without me;\n\nI might need you tomorrow.\n\nWalk right beside me,\n\nBe the real friend I need.\n\n\n\nDon't walk in front of me;\n\nI was not born to follow.\n\nDon't walk behind me;\n\nWe were all born to lead.\n\nDon't walk without me;\n\nI might need you tomorrow.\n\nWalk right beside me,\n\nBe the real friend I need.\n\n\n\nWalk right beside me,\n\nBe the real friend I need.",
