Penciled in the timing\r\nYou know pens are only for fools…\r\nDrift around when you want it\r\nNever seem to follow the rules…\r\nEnough of my talking, never be misunderstood\n\n(If you need help, dial the operator)\n\nThen you crept in my back door!\n\nNow I know that you're pissed off\n\nWant to put your hands round my throat\n\nYou looked like the devil\n\nIt was something I could see right through\n\nNow I caught you counting the seconds until I'm through\n\nThen you crept through my back door\n\nThen you crept through my back door\n\nThen you crept through my back door\n\n(Are you talking to me?)",
