  "lyrics": "I feel a little nauseous and my hands are shaking\r\nI guess I need you close by\r\nMy throat is getting dry and my heart is racing\r\nI haven't been by your side\r\nIn a minute, but I think about it sometimes\r\nEven though I know it's not so distant\n\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it\n\n\n\nI think of the night in the park, it was getting dark\n\nAnd we stayed up for hours\n\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time\n\nYou clinged my body like you wanted it forever\n\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time\n\nFor you and I\n\nWhat a time, what a time\n\nFor you and I\n\n\n\nI know we didn't end it like we're supposed to\n\nAnd now we get a bit tense\n\nI wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad parts\n\nI know we didn't make sense\n\nI admit it that I think about it sometimes\n\nEven though I know it's not so distant\n\nOh, no, I still wanna reminisce it\n\n\n\nI think of the night in the park, it was getting dark\n\nAnd we stayed up for hours\n\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time\n\nYou clinged my body like you wanted it forever\n\nWhat a time, what a time, what a time\n\nFor you and I\n\nWhat a time, what a time\n\nFor you and I\n\n\n\nFor you and I\n\nFor you and I\n\nFor you and I\n\nWhat a time, what a time for you and I\n\nWhat a time for you and I, yeah\n\nWhat a time, what a time for you and I\n\n\n\nI think of the night in the park, it was getting dark\n\nAnd we stayed up for hours\n\nWhat a lie, what a lie, what a lie\n\nYou clinged my body like you wanted it forever\n\nWhat a lie, what a lie, what a lie\n\nFor you and I\n\nWhat a lie, what a lie\n\nFor you and I\n\n\n\nFor you and I (For you)\n\nFor you and I (For you)\n\nFor you and I (For you and I)\n\nFor you and I, yeah",
