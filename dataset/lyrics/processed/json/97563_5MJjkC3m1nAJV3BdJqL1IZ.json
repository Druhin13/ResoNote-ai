  "lyrics": "I still watch you when you're groovin'\r\nAs if through water from the bottom of a pool\r\nYou're movin' without movin'\r\nAnd when you move, I'm moved\r\nYou are a call to motion\r\nThere, all of you a verb in perfect view\n\nLike Jonah on the ocean\n\nWhen you move, I'm moved\n\n\n\nWhen you move\n\nI'm put to mind of all that I wanna be\n\nWhen you move\n\nI could never define all that you are to me\n\n\n\nSo move me, baby\n\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\n\nYou do it naturally\n\nMove me, baby\n\n\n\nYou are the rite of movement\n\nIts reasonin' made lucid and cool\n\nI know it's no improvement\n\nWhen you move, I move\n\nYou're less Polunin leapin'\n\nOr Fred Astaire in sequins\n\nHoney, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'\n\nAnd when you move, I'm moved\n\n\n\nWhen you move\n\nI can recall somethin' that's gone from me\n\nWhen you move\n\nHoney, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free\n\n\n\nSo move me, baby\n\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\n\nYou do it naturally\n\nMove me, baby\n\nSo move me, baby\n\nLike you've nothin' left to prove\n\nAnd nothin' to lose\n\nMove me, baby\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\nOh baby, oh baby\n\nMove like grey skies\n\nMove like a bird of paradise\n\nMove like an odd sight come out at night\n\n\n\nMove me, baby\n\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\n\nYou do it naturally\n\nMove me, baby\n\nSo move me, baby\n\nLike you've nothin' left to lose\n\nAnd nothin' to prove\n\nMove me, baby\n\nSo move me, baby\n\nShake like the bough of a willow tree\n\nYou do it naturally\n\nMove me, baby",
