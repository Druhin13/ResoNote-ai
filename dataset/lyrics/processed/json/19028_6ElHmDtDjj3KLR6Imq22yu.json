  "lyrics": "Pacing the pavement\r\nI savor the waste and the moments that you gave me\r\nMy mind has been clouded with the thoughts and the memories I can't talk about\r\nThe slip of the tongue\r\nNow I’m in trouble again\r\nI carry the stem of what was left to condemn\n\nI’m young and I’m dumb\n\nSo shit just happens to me\n\nI’ll struggle with who I want to be\n\n\n\nLife's so much easier I'll have you believe\n\nThat everything's different when you turn eighteen\n\nI've tossed and I've turned\n\nTrying to find my way out\n\nI paint on my smile that I wear around\n\n\n\nThe day I was born, the world stood still held its breath\n\nStripped all my pride and then it left me for dead\n\nPretend I’m not all alone or you still lay in my bed\n\nConfuse all my thoughts so that you’re not in my head\n\n\n\nLife's so much easier I'll have you believe\n\nThat everything's different when you turn eighteen\n\nI've tossed and I've turned\n\nTrying to find my way out\n\nI paint on my smile that I wear around\n\n\n\nI’ve been down for a long time\n\nNow probably happy\n\nIn the end it’s the same so let me stop wash rinse repeat\n\n\n\nLife's so much easier I'll have you believe\n\nThat everything's different when you turn eighteen\n\nI've tossed and I've turned\n\nTrying to find my way out\n\nI paint on my smile that I wear around",
