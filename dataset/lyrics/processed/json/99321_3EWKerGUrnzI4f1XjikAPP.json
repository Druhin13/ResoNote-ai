  "lyrics": "Fat Charlie the ArchangelSloped into the roomHe said I have no opinion about thisAnd I have no opinion about thatSad as a lonely little wrinkled balloonHe said well I don't claim to be happy about this, boysAnd I don't seem to be happy about thatI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveShe says she knows about jokesThis time the joke is on meWell, I have no opinion about thatAnd I have no opinion about meSomebody could walk into this roomAnd say your life is on fireIt's all over the evening newsAll about the fire in your lifeOn the evening newsI don't want no patr of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveFat Charlie the ArchangelFiles for divorceHe says well this will eat up a year of my lifeAnd then there's all that weight to be lostShe says the joke is on meI say the joke is on herI said I have no opinion about thatWell, we'll just wait and conferI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of your loveI don't want no part of this crazy loveI don't want no part of this crazy love",
