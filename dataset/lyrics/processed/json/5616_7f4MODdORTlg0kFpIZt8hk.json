  "lyrics": "You worried I have given\r\nHave lsot direction for the cause\r\nHave traded truth for confidence\r\nWent back on all my promises\r\nI am not old but I've become\r\nAfraid of things I never was\n\nAnd stumbling on without a pause\n\nCan only go so long\n\n\n\nDid you say that I was the lifer\n\nDid you say that life could be better\n\n\n\nIt seems to those who know me best\n\nMy luck is wild and in excess\n\nI don't why some suffer so\n\nAnd others never fear to go\n\nI won't reduce myself to air\n\nUndo myself for your affair\n\nI've shown you everything I am\n\nYou choose or not to understand\n\n\n\nThere is a logic to the rule\n\nThe end is kind, the mean is cruel\n\nI have to love the life I make\n\nMake up for all the space I take\n\nMistaken for an oversight\n\n\n\nThe absence of my appetite\n\nThe source of all my arrogance\n\nI left it up to chance\n\n\n\nI believed that I was the lifer\n\nI believed that life could be better\n\n\n\nI want to see you rise again\n\nTo see life in your eyes again\n\nTo feel your pulse is beating strong\n\nTo prove all of us wrong\n\n\n\nWill you say that you are the lifer\n\nDo you think that life could be better\n\nWill you say that I am the lifer\n\nDo you think that life could be better",
