  "lyrics": "I'm embarrassed to know you at all\r\nIt's why I keep the conversations small\r\nIs there a reason why you stick around?\r\nAnd I'm embarrassed when you make a sound\r\nThere is a time I hear your voice\n\nWhen I can [?]\n\n\n\nI'm too careless to ignore you\n\nOr is it because you tell me the truth?\n\nSo I'll answer whenever you call\n\nBut I'm embarrassed to know you at all\n\n\n\nThe times I bear to hear your sound\n\nI'll admit that your voice is really mine",
