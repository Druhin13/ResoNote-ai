  "lyrics": "It's a lonely feelin', wavin' you goodbye\r\nI don't know what I'm leavin', until the moment is gone\r\nCheckin' in and then checkin' out\r\nI get tired, call it grumpy\r\nBut I'm never in doubt, that you've got my back now\n\nWhen I see you again\n\n\n\nSometimes it's like nothin' is going my way\n\nEven though I know I'm getting up on the stage\n\nBut now that I'm here, I got reason to believe\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me\n\n\n\nThe airline lost my luggage, still got all this wait\n\nAnd all the things I'm done with, are showin' up again\n\n\n\nBreakin' in but I won't break down\n\nI get tired, call it grumpy\n\nBut I'm never in doubt, that you've got my back now\n\nWhen I see you again\n\n\n\nSometimes it's like nothin' is going my way\n\nEven though I know I'm gettin' up on the stage\n\nBut now that I'm here, I got reason to believe\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be damned if I ever forget\n\nJust how lucky I am to be\n\nClose to you when I needed the most\n\nCan you hold me if I wanna leave?\n\n\n\nBreakin' in but I won't break down\n\nI get tired, call it grumpy\n\nBut I'm never in doubt, that you've got my back now\n\nWhen I see you again\n\n\n\nSometimes it's like nothin' is going my way\n\nEven though I know I'm getting up on the stage\n\nBut now that I'm here, I got reason to believe\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me\n\nSometimes it's like nothing is going my way\n\nEven though I know I'm getting up on the stage\n\nBut now that I'm here, I got reason to believe\n\nJust the sight of you is getting the best out of me",
