  "lyrics": "These four walls have got a story to tell\r\nOh-oh, oh-oh\r\nThe door is off the hinges, there's no wishing them well\r\nOh-oh, oh-oh\r\nOutside the sky is coal black, \n\nThe streets are on fire\n\nThe picture windows cracked, \n\nAnd there's nowhere to run\n\nI know, I know, \n\nThis house is not for sale\n\n\n\nI set each stone and I hammered each nail\n\nThis house is not for sale\n\nWhen memories live and the dreams don't fail\n\nThis house is not for sale\n\nComing home, I'm coming home\n\n\n\nSwirl my spike into the ground and I stake my claim\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n\nStanding on the dirt where they'll dig my grave\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n\n\n\nNow I built these walls, it's in my veins\n\nNo time for lookin' back, \n\nThe world is out the door\n\nThis heart, this soul, \n\nThis house is not for sale\n\n\n\nI set each stone and I hammered each nail\n\nThis house is not for sale\n\nWhen memories live and the dreams don't fail\n\nThis house is not for sale\n\nComing home, I'm coming home\n\n\n\nThis house was built on trust\n\nThat's what it is, and always was\n\nNo wrecking ball can knock it down\n\nThis house was built on higher ground\n\n\n\nI set each stone and I hammered each nail\n\nThis house is not for sale\n\nWhen memories live and the dreams don't fail\n\nThis house is not for sale\n\nComing home, I'm coming home\n\nComing home, I'm coming home\n\n(This house is not for sale)\n\nComing home, I'm coming home\n\nI'm coming home\n\n(I built this house, is not for sale)",
