  "lyrics": "On a walk in a fragile state\r\nWeird angles coming over the wire\r\nBack home we got girls in braids\r\nAnd they're on roller skates, and they roll any way they like\r\nFrom my town I can always look down\n\nDown from my nose to the fish in the barrels\n\nBut in the wiles of human life\n\nThere are pity nights and a ray of gentle lights\n\n\n\nSo tonight\n\nDance and cry\n\nThe dead alive\n\n\n\nMonuments were awfully dense\n\nI flew by in a daze on the freeway\n\nHe can whine of our different times\n\nBut me, I'm fine with the mirrors this far away\n\n\n\nFor the muse in our bodies to function\n\nRain gonna fall on the hills where we hide\n\nWash the blood and the guts to the ocean\n\nLeave the pike making everything alright\n\n\n\nSo tonight\n\nDance and cry\n\nThe dead alive\n\n\n\nSo tonight\n\nDance and cry\n\nThe dead alive\n\n\n\nFigments\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination (figments of imagination)\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination\n\nFigments of imagination\n\n(Figments of imagination)",
