  "lyrics": "\"You’re not free with your Cadillac! You’re doing just exactly what the Man wants you to do: Buy his goods, so you’ll never have any real economic freedom. He wants you to buy everything he advertises on TV, so he’ll keep you perpetually owing your soul to the company store. You’re not free, you’re a slave!\"\r\nGimme no drugs, lend me some love\r\nTonight, while I'm in this club\r\nLonely as fuck, with my thugs\r\nAnd we looking for that buzz\n\nGimme no drugs, lend me some love\n\nTonight, while I'm in this club\n\nLonely as fuck, with my thugs\n\nAnd we looking for that buzz\n\n\n\nWhat's with these superficial people from my past?\n\nDancin' 'round the fact that\n\nI did everything the motherfuckers bet against\n\nThey be like, \"Gather 'round, place your bets!\n\nThis young man won't ever be shit!\"\n\nWell my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit\n\nWhile you chose to settle down to have some kids\n\nI mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back\n\nThat's a long ass line that I'm not in\n\nI just never found the time, or had the chance\n\nTruth is, you can kiss my ass\n\nNever been the one to bow down\n\nNever been the one to air out\n\nAny situation, but right now\n\nWhen it's all your fault, I'm here now\n\n\n\nGimme no drugs, lend me some love\n\nTonight, while I'm in this club\n\nLonely as fuck, with my thugs\n\nAnd we looking for that buzz\n\nGimme no drugs, lend me some love\n\nTonight, while I'm in this club\n\nLonely as fuck, with my thugs\n\nAnd we looking for that buzz\n\n\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\n\n\nThrift like a five hundred discount\n\nI move it, I move it like Madagascar\n\nFlip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw\n\nBloody leaf color like fall\n\nWhen you were calling, they said I'll be nothing\n\nWell, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls\n\nThey try to pin me down, they try to bind me\n\nAnd they try to kill me like Anna Nicole\n\nTh-th-they want the boot of my car\n\nPussy boy like booty call\n\nMoney quick like auctioneer\n\nLook what we did in a year\n\nYou need a neutral career\n\nI hate on myself when I look in the mirror\n\nHear them lil' voices all up in my ear\n\nWhy do I care how I look?\n\nWhy do I care what they say?\n\nI do not care what they say\n\n\n\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk (Man, they talk too much!)\n\nThey forgot how to listen (listen!)\n\n'Til the prophets arisen\n\nWe mix new edition with nuclear fission\n\nI don't do auditions, I don't ask permission\n\nAin't no politician, don't ask my opinion\n\nYou got an addiction to what ain’t your business\n\nMake the admission, I make like magicians\n\nAnd hit my Houdini\n\nWhy they so soft like linguine?\n\nI murder this music routinely, I know that you see me\n\nDon't see you searching the meaning\n\nI think that’s why you won't believe and\n\nThe future is leaning\n\nRevolutions started streaming\n\nThe reason why you see me beaming\n\nI'm dreaming of making moves like the government\n\nYou better think about who you fucking with, get back\n\n\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\nDon't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't\n\n\n\n(Free, ah, ah) Oh, your love\n\nWon't you come this close to me?\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nBe with me now that you're free (free, free)\n\nOh yeah (yeah)\n\nWon't you come this close to me, baby?\n\nBaby, yeah (yeah)\n\n\n\nAnd if I could erase who you thought I was\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\n\nAnd if I could erase who you thought I was\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah",
