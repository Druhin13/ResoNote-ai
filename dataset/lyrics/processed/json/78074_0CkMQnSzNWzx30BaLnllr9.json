  "lyrics": "In and out of trouble, in and out of love\r\nShe had that dirty blonde hair, my vanilla cream-puff\r\nShe looked just like a million, maybe even two\r\nI remember everything, how about you?\r\nIce cream kisses, summer in the park\r\nMomma gettin' mad when we would sneak out in the dark\n\nI'd take you to the movies just so I could hold your hand\n\nYou were a pretty lady, and I was your man\n\nBut I remember that one night like it was yesterday\n\nWe were standing in the moonlight, there was nothing in the way\n\nYou looked into my eyes, and said, \"Show me love\n\nRight here, right now, under the stars above\"\n\n\n\nWe were 17, under the chestnut tree\n\nI heard the thunder rolling as you sat down on me\n\nAnd I was so in love, in love with you\n\nI would have done anything for you\n\n\n\nYou had beautiful features, and a [?]\n\nWe'd been kissing at the game, hiding out under the bleachers\n\nAnd the crowds don't hear it, you were going \"Ohh\"\n\nUntil Mr. Van showed up out the blue\n\nHot damn, we must have been running all night\n\nWhen we got to your momma's house, you looked me in the eyes\n\nAnd gave me a kiss, right before you said\n\nThat you're moving so far away\n\nAnd I know it's over, yeah\n\nYou got tears rolling down your cheeks\n\nYou looking at me with those hazel eyes\n\nThat night under the chestnut tree\n\n\n\nWe were 17, under the chestnut tree\n\nI heard the thunder rolling as you sat down on me\n\nAnd I was so in love, in love with you\n\nI would have done anything for you\n\n\n\nWe were 17, under the chestnut tree\n\nI heard the thunder rolling as you sat down on me\n\nAnd I was so in love, lo-lo-lo-love with you\n\nI would have done anything for you",
