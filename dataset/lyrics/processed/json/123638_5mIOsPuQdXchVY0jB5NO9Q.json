  "lyrics": "Some things just aren't that simple\r\nYou called me wondering why I changed\r\nOr why I don't look the same\r\nWhy are things so differently now?\r\nIs it ever gonna change?\n\nAm I gonna feel this way forever?\n\nAre you gonna be around for me to count on?\n\nIs it ever gonna change?\n\nAm I gonna feel this way forever?\n\nAre you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\n\n\nSome things just never seem to fade\n\nI'm thinking about how we were on our first date\n\nYou once stood, the words are stained\n\nI knew I'd never let you get away\n\n\n\nHold you tight, squeeze you right, tell you what I want\n\nPut me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song\n\nHold you tight, squeeze you right, give you all I've got\n\nSee you in the morning, over coffee, we'll talk, oh\n\n\n\nIs it ever gonna change?\n\nAm I gonna feel this way forever?\n\nAre you gonna be around for me to count on?\n\nIs it ever gonna change?\n\nAm I gonna feel this way forever?\n\nAre you gonna be around for me to count on? Count on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on\n\nOn-on-on, on-on-on-on-on",
