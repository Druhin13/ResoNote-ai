  "lyrics": "I don't want to be your fucking dog\r\nThat you drag around\r\nA collar on my neck tied to a pole\r\nLeave me in the freezing cold\r\nI don't want to be your little pet\n\nAt the edge of every bed\n\nYour sleeping body stretching out\n\nGuess I'll curl up on the couch\n\n\n\nAlways talk to other people\n\nDart my eyes across the room\n\nForehead kisses break my knees in\n\nLeave me crawling back to you\n\n\n\nCause I don't want to be your fucking dog\n\nThat you drag around\n\nA collar on my neck tied to a pole\n\nLeave me in the freezing cold\n\n\n\nAlways talk to other people\n\nDart my eyes across the room\n\nForehead kisses break my knees in\n\nLeave me crawling back to you\n\n\n\nCause I don't want to be your baby girl\n\nThat you show off to the world\n\nWhen do you decide you want to feel\n\nLike you limit something real\n\n\n\nI'm not a prop for you to use\n\nWhen you're lonely or confused\n\nI want a love that lets me breathe\n\nI've been choking on your leash",
