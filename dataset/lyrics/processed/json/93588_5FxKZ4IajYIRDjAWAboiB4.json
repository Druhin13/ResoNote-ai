Pimpin' ain't easy\n\nI’m invincible, niggas can’t beat me\n\nAyy, what's the principle? Pimpin’ ain't easy\n\nI'm invincible, niggas can't beat me\n\n\n\nI was in the 8-5, me and Pac hittin’ it\n\nI been out six months, made four million\n\nSlide in the 6-4, windows tinted\n\nNigga had to get low, them boys start hittin'\n\nFuck around, hit the lil' hoe with no jimmy\n\nIf a nigga say go, better go kill him\n\nSaid that Lil' Zo he cut throat with no feelings\n\nMama watch her lil' boy turn into a menace\n\nI don't care, I go fed and get a life sentence\n\nI want everybody dead, nigga no limit\n\nI don't shake niggas' hands, 'cause I ain't friendly\n\nWhen I pull up to the crib, have no pendants\n\nI been leanin' to the right, like I'm on xannies\n\nI been thuggin' all my life, I ain't romantic\n\nWhen I whip out the .45, don't panic\n\nWhen I whip out the .45, don't panic\n\n\n\nI be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas\n\nI go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches\n\nLike a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me\n\nIf a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me\n\nWhat's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy\n\nI'm invincible, niggas can't beat me\n\nAyy, what's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy\n\nI'm invincible, niggas can't beat me\n\n\n\nNew AP, flood, water on my butt like a tub\n\nI got my lil' gun in the club, don't worry about me, I'm a thug\n\nYou a kill a street nigga, get a dime\n\nIf you kill a rap nigga, get a dub\n\nBig chain on my neck, don't budge\n\nFuckin' DeJ Loaf like a stud\n\nI swapped out the mic for the gun\n\nI swapped out the ice for the mud\n\nI swapped out the spice for the bud\n\nFuckin' on a dyke, I'm in love\n\nI'm fuckin' with a dyke, she the one\n\nKodak don't show no remorse, I be automatic tryin' get a nigga touched\n\nKodak on tour, with his boys, say they got a whole gun store on the bus\n\nMissy Elliott, come and sex me\n\nHoppin' off a jet, to a cheque, to a jet-ski\n\nI beatbox a nigga like the music\n\nI'm thuggin' in my Reebok, I never need Gucci\n\nI don't even see the confusion\n\nI'm fuckin' Young M.A., long as she got a coochie\n\nSay she got the strap and the toolie, say she put the crack in her booty\n\n\n\nI be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas\n\nI go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches\n\nLike a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me\n\nIf a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me\n\nWhat's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy\n\nI'm invincible, niggas can't beat me\n\nAyy, What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy\n\nI'm invincible, niggas can't beat me",
