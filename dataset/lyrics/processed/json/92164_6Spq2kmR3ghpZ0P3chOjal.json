  "lyrics": "Flash back last year in my room\r\nWhen I prayed for this life to come true\r\nNow I ride up the hills in the ubs\r\nWith the crew mid june knowing we cannot lose\r\nIn the city where they shake it for the loot\r\nIn a place where they flex to hide the truth\n\nYeah I come in the spot and I swoop\n\nAnd I know you talking shit cause u trynna figure out my head\n\n\n\nIn my head, In my head, In my head\n\nOh I\n\nWon’t give in u know I see through ur lies\n\nOh no I can't let anyone in my mind x2\n\nMy mind\n\n\n\nAnd I know\n\nHow you switch trynna fit the roll\n\nDo the most just to get close\n\nSmilin warm but the heart is cold\n\nWant me down you just want my lows\n\nSo many friends turn into foes\n\nAnd at the top thats how life goes\n\nAnd I know\n\nAnd I know\n\n\n\nYou know the feeling\n\nSee it I want it\n\n305 ocean drive on a Sunday morning\n\nType of life everybody wanna be living\n\nMake the moves go right so I know I get it\n\nLife's a bitch gotta play her cause she unforgiving\n\nIf u can't move forward you ain't with it\n\nTakin notes on who’s out here moving suspect\n\nAnd I go ghost just to filter out the toxic\n\n\n\nIn my head, In my head, In my head\n\nOh I\n\nWon’t give in u know I see through ur lies\n\nOh no I can't let anyone in my mind x2\n\nMy mind\n\n\n\nAnd I know\n\nHow you switch trynna fit the roll\n\nDo the most just to get close\n\nSmilin warm but the heart is cold\n\nWant me down you just want my lows\n\nSo many friends turn into foes\n\nAnd at the top thats how life goes\n\nAnd I know\n\nAnd I know",
