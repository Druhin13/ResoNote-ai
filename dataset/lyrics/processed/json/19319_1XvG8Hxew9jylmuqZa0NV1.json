  "lyrics": "Now we're gonna set fire to last year\r\nSaid goodbye to the songs and the old dreams we held dear\r\nSetbacks and all of those dead ends\r\nAnd a million reasons why we gotta give it in\r\nWe're all in it for the long road\n\nWe're all in it for life\n\n\n\nRun with me baby\n\nI need you more than ever\n\nI won't let you\n\nWon't let you down\n\n\n\nSaid all of those things that we don't mean\n\nWe get caught up in the moment and forget who we are meant to be\n\nI'll meet you at the eye of the storm\n\nBring your kind heart with you cause you know we're gonna need it once more\n\n\n\nWe're all in it for the long road\n\nWe're all in it for life\n\n\n\nRun with me baby\n\nI need you more than ever\n\nI won't let you\n\nWon't let you down\n\n\n\nCome with me darling\n\nI swear we gonna make it\n\nI won't let you\n\nWon't let you down\n\n\n\nAnd all through winter I've\n\nBeen dancing with an angel\n\nShe says we'll be fine\n\nOh I\n\n\n\nRun with me baby\n\nI need you more than ever\n\nI won't let you\n\nWon't let you down\n\n\n\nCome with me darling\n\nI swear we gonna make it\n\nI won't let you\n\nWon't let you down\n\n\n\nI won't let you\n\nWon't let you down",
