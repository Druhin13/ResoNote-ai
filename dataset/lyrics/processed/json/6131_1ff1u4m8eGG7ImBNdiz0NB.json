  "lyrics": "A fifteen year old kid from Saint Paul\r\nHopped on a train and headed west\r\nGot a job at a Saint Mary Resturaunt\r\nWashing dishes and making friends\r\nThe years went by like the seasons\n\nAnd they brought him a lifetime of joy\n\nHe bought ten or twelve acres of heaven\n\nWith a paradise vanish point\n\n\n\nAnd he built a cabin at the foot of the mountains\n\nThat stole his heart when he was a boy\n\n\n\nOn North Fork Road you're almost home\n\n\n\nGet lost in Montana\n\nWhere your heart can finally roam\n\nGet lost in Montana\n\nWhere the mountains call you home\n\nGet lost forever in Montana\n\n\n\nHis son worked hard in West Glacier\n\nHis daughter sold souvineers\n\nAnd he always went back to Polebridge\n\nWith his family every year\n\n\n\nTo his green tint roof in the Rockies\n\nAnd a sky so full of stars\n\nHis spirit lives in these mountians\n\nWhere Montana stole his heart\n\n\n\nOn North Fork Road you're almost home\n\n\n\nGet lost in Montana\n\nWhere your heart can finally roam\n\nGet lost in Montana\n\nWhere the mountains call you home\n\nGet lost forever in Montana\n\n\n\nTwo words on a bumper sticker\n\nWere all I needed to read\n\nI found myself for the first time\n\nWhen Montana enchanted me\n\n\n\nSo get lost in the Big Sky country\n\nWhere adventure calls your name\n\nEvery moment is worth more than diamonds\n\nWhen you spend time in the treasure state\n\n\n\nSo get lost in the Big Sky country\n\nAnd let your heart lead the way",
