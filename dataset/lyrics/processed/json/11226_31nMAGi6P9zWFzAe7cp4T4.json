  "lyrics": "She's a stone cut by the Maker's hands\r\nSpeaks a tongue you never understand\r\nI'm a man, the son of what I've seen\r\nSkin and bones, she's more than history\r\nEven now, I feel her\n\nDon't know why I need her\n\nI let down my guard, open my heart to bleed\n\nStrange how this life, passes us by\n\nStill I will never reach her mystery\n\n\n\nLeave what's left for undiscovered land\n\nLove's now lost, just hidden in your plan\n\nTake my hand and show me where to go\n\nYou and I can do this on our own\n\n\n\nEven now, I feel her\n\nDon't know why I need her\n\nI let down my guard, open my heart to bleed\n\nStrange how this life, passes us by\n\nStill I will never reach her mystery\n\n\n\nEvery single and so you won't give\n\nEverything that you meant\n\n\n\nEven now, I feel her\n\nDon't know why I need her\n\nI let down my guard, open my heart to bleed\n\nStrange how this life, passes us by\n\nStill I will never reach, her mystery",
