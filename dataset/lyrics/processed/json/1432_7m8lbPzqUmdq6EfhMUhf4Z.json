Travis Barker]\r\n(I'm legendary)\r\n[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9\"]\r\nTheme song to my supplier\n\nPlays in the key of a key\n\nI'm like a messiah crossed with The Wire\n\nRapping around the Boardwalk Empire\n\nWho brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter\n\nI'm sick enough to take my life\n\nThen take your life after\n\nDon't take me light or play me light\n\nWe two of the same\n\nGod melted a Rubic's cube into fluid and threw it in my intuitive brain\n\nI'm eating food for moving music in a gratuitous lane\n\nI threw twice, now I'm running through it til I'm through with the game\n\nYou can find me under a black cloud I'm a dark star\n\nOnly thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car\n\nI climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell\n\nIf you could put a face with my style it'd be Samuel Cassel's\n\nI switched the fire up like I am a tranny from hell\n\nWhat I got in my hand right now should remind you of Stanley Burrell\n\nCause it's the hammer the cannon you can dance with the shells\n\nMy pet peeves are granny panties and planning to fail\n\nI'm a heavyweight, I'm catastrophic when I set it like Farenheit 9/11,\n\nMeditate till the levees break\n\nI tar and feather featherweight till my fetti straight\n\nThe mac 11 will clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face\n\nUh, you ever look inside some dying eyes?\n\nYou'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God\n\nWhen was the last time that you heard that the iron tried?\n\nRyan vibes like cyanide, I am proud\n\nTo say that I've evolved there's only one \"I\" in \"defying odds\"\n\nSmall time arrogance parishes everytime in giant pride\n\nWho ya'll respect is probably cross-dressing\n\nYour favorite MC could probably find themself vibing to my lost sections\n\nI'm legendary\n\n\n\n[Hook:]\n\nNow everybody wanna believe me, but they don't really know what's in my heart\n\nThis time around is starting to feel easy, my enemies startin to fall down\n\n(I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary)\n\nMy enemies startin to fall down\n\n(I'm legendary, legend-legendary, le-le-legendary)\n\nFall Down\n\n(I'm legendary)\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9\"]\n\nI got my noodles intact\n\nYou want support of Detroit rap niggas can Google this gat\n\nCause we the reason why you eating we put the food on the map\n\nRight where the mitten is and you ain't do jack\n\nJust who we hittin here? This here's a different year,\n\nYou should'ntassume I'm tryna measure up to you when I tell you the ruler is back\n\nIn fact, as far as you new kids, what've you did?\n\nI know that I've burnt some bridges in the past but I'm happy to say that I've built a new bridge\n\nAs far as killin I'm forever willing and ready\n\nI will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete\n\nUh, you marry the streets than we will kill at your wedding\n\nTell every guest at your reception they gon get more than just hit with confetti\n\nUh, now your bitch a believer,\n\nYou know what you get when you mix a bumblee with a lamb?\n\nYou get the 'ghini I'm sitting in\n\nRiding through Pittsburgh while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa\n\nBlack & Yellow a blunt to joint, here's the reefer\n\nOne minute you tough, one minute you shook\n\nI know I've learned a while ago to hide power from you I should just put it in a book\n\nYou illiterate parasites I'll kill you everytime\n\nThrow a nigga body around the room have a nigga lookin like Jamiroquai\n\nAnd yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth looks 100 times better then the best dressed lie\n\nAnd while you niggas is hatin, I wonder is God really an athiest\n\nHe made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan\n\nYa'll need to repent because ya'll been imitating\n\nA statue of me to you is a statute of limitations\n\nYou backwards as me and a feminist dating\n\nLet's tally the sales, like Gladys and Patty LaBelle\n\nI'm a big wig, my straws in the hole of a volcano I'm havin a big swig\n\n\n\n[Hook:]\n\nEverybody wanna believe me\n\nBut they don't really know what's in my heart\n\nIt's time I started to feel easy\n\nMy enemies starting to fall down",
