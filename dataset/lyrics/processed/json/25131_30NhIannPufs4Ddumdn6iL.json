  "lyrics": "At seventeen, you wouldn't be the youngest corpse heaven's seen\r\nFor a pair of Air Jordans size 11 clean\r\nYou would hustle during REM hours\r\nIf you pushed up daisies or gaury stem flowers\r\nLook alive\r\nNow everyone has your best interests at heart\n\nWouldn't be close if y'all was interests apart\n\nThe interesting part\n\nAt sixteen, you work a shift at Mickey D's\n\nRead comic books, kept your room clean, and your grades up\n\nBut now they slippin'\n\nLike bloods hanging where they crippin'\n\nPut the cock back, stick the clip in\n\nYou see how girls love the jewelry drippin'\n\nAnd gossipin' about what they whippin'\n\nYou and them never locked lips when you were sixteen\n\nYou lost your virginity a month ago\n\nWeeks before that, you started puffin' dro\n\nHangin' with the wrong crowd, joyridin' in the stolen car\n\nBangin' songs loud\n\nMom's kicked you out the crib\n\n'Cause you stayed out all night, stay high all day, and that will make you fight\n\nYou thinking you grown\n\nYou only seventeen\n\nYou wouldn't be the youngest corpse that heaven's seen\n\nFor a pair of Air Jordans size 11 clean\n\nYou would run up on a n, steal somebody's car, empty out the reverend's jeans\n\n\n\nNow you off the pills\n\nPushing wheels\n\nAnd stacking up some dollar bills\n\nHow it feels\n\nTo live the life you hear about portrayed inside of rap songs and see inside of movies made by Paramount\n\nYour mom's praying for, you wonder what the prayer 'bout\n\nIs it the duck low in areas that your rivals' airing out?\n\nLast week your man's got shot, but he recovered\n\nHe came home, murdered one and looking for the other\n\nSo now you stay strapped at all times\n\n'Cause life involves crime that could kill you like the fall from a tall climb\n\nPlus you live under the same roof with his granny\n\nLivin' wild, taking xanny, sniffin' nose candy\n\nWhen you got the call from your first telling you that she hasn't had her period\n\nOf course she wasn't hearing it\n\nYoung and inexperienced\n\nYou were just sixteen last year\n\nWorking drive thru as a cashier\n\nSometimes you past there and reminisce\n\nNow you in some hot water and your choices are to swim a fish\n\n'Cause last night is when your spot got raided\n\nBe lucky that no hotshot sprayed it\n\nYou thinking you grown, you only seventeen\n\nYou wouldn't be the youngest corpse that heaven's seen\n\nFor a pair of Air Jordans size 11 clean\n\nYou would risk it all\n\nKeep your mouth shut or stab a knife into your brethren's spleen\n\nThose are repercussions that you probabaly ain't seen\n\nHope you make better decisions when you eighteen\n\nIf you doing jailtime and swipe the slate clean\n\nHope you make better decisions when you eighteen\n\nOnce you learn the definition of what fate mean\n\nHope you make better decisions when you-\n\n*gun shot*\n\n\n\nToo many fake friendships nowadays\n\nI'm gonna give you my own insight on this subject\n\nWhen we talk of people not being who they say they are\n\nWe meet people, they turn on us, they change\n\nWe're like, \"Wait a minute. What are you doing?\"\n\nI say it's all about looking how to attract positive versions of yourself and negative versions of yourself\n\nYou see, a lot of us\n\nWe see someone and they're smiling, they're happy, they're singing, they're full of joy\n\nAnd we say, \"Oh, I like that person.\"\n\nBut you haven't seen their other side\n\nNow depending on which side they show you\n\nThat is gonna form an image of them in your mind\n\nThat is why a lot of us, we don't show our negative side to people\n\nBecause otherwise, we're not gonna have any friends\n\nI say, it's all about knowing who you are to attract the right people to assist you in becoming your greatest version\n\nWhen we talk of how to spot a fake friend or how to find the right friend\n\nI say, for instance, right now in this social media world\n\nYou can have thousands of friends, but ask yourself\n\nOn a rainy day when you're home alone, will they be around?\n\nWill they be around when the times are hard?\n\nProbably not",
