  "lyrics": "Blue skies shining down, oh Lord, what can it be?\r\nYou got the gift of your morale\r\nBut you know ain't nothing's free\r\nRed skies burning bright, it's another dark days' night\r\nJust a prayer to blood his sacrament of everything I write\r\n♪\r\nWell, anything is possible if you got the needs\r\nYou just call your friend who lives within for everything he brings\r\nWhat you want is a pick-me-up, well, I got just what you need\r\nYou just take this gift, that tit for tat, but you know ain't nothing free\r\n'Cause the day I saw the grave, I just knew I'd misbehave\r\nGoing out there every night, drinkin' whiskey, shootin' dice\r\nThinkin' nothing but myself, thinkin' nothing 'bout my health\r\nCrazy women all the way, I could do this every day\r\nI owe it all to you\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\nI owe it all to you\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\nWell, the nights are growing longer now and I lift your name on high\r\nBurning every wick from end to end, but never question why\r\nAnd I've lost the hope, I've lost the feeling, I've lost the times of days gone by\r\nWhen you're dancing with the Devil, it's so easy you don't have to try\r\n'Cause the day I saw the grave, I just knew I'd misbehave\r\nGoing out there every night, drinkin' whiskey, shootin' dice\r\nThinkin' nothing 'bout my health, thinkin' nothing but myself\r\nCrazy women all the way, I could do this every day\r\nBut we all need our motivation\r\nWe all need a bit of fun\r\nYou can give away your dollar bill\r\nBut can you really name one single thing\r\nOne selfless act you've ever done?\r\n♪\r\n'Cause the day I saw the grave, I just knew I'd misbehave\r\nGoing out there every night, drinkin' whiskey, shootin' dice\r\nThinkin' nothing 'bout my health, thinkin' nothing but myself\r\nCrazy women all the way, I could do this every day\r\nI owe it all to you\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\nI owe it all to you\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\nI owe it all to you\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\nI owe it all to you\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\n(Shake it, baby)\r\nI owe it all to you",
