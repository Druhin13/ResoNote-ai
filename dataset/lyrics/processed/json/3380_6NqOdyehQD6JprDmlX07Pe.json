  "lyrics": "This is my emergency\r\nLet me feel your apathy\r\nAre we swimming in the same old sea?\r\nThe one where you don't care to rescue me\r\nThere's water in my lungs again\n\nThe moon's reflection has no end\n\nThe taste of salt my biggest sin\n\nThe taste of you my only sin\n\n\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\n\n\nThis is my emergency\n\nLet me feel your apathy\n\n\n\nHold me underneath the cold moonlight\n\nWhere I believe every lie you told to me\n\nTell me once more that I'm safe\n\nI never believed, so give me faith\n\nThe fear of death is sinking in\n\nI'd rather die than sink with you\n\n\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay\n\nYou can't make it okay",
