  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Good is Back par Anggun\r\nCongratulations you have the flat\nYou keep the car I keep the cat\nYou have your anger and your pride\nNot to forget the lies on the side\nBut in every item you own\nInside and outside our home\nWell, you don’t have me, no\nYou don’t have me\n\n'Cause I’m gone, gone\nTake my liberty\nThere’s a price to pay to be free\n'Cause I’m gone, gone\nNo matter how bad you make me feel\nNo matter how hard you try\nThe good is back, the good is back, the good is back\n\nThe good is back, in the word goodbye\n\nYou can say that your conscience is free\nHiding things you refuse to see\nYou can go up North or way South\nYou still have the bad taste in your mouth\nAnd when you spent your time with her\nOr when you think you feel better\nNo you don’t have me\nWell, she is not me\n\n'Cause I’m gone, gone\nTake my liberty\nThere’s a price to pay to be free\n'Cause I’m gone, gone\nNo matter how bad you make me feel\nNo matter how hard you try\nThe good is back, the good is back, the good is back\n\nThe good is back, in the word goodbye\n\nWhat we split in somewhat equal\nIs only the hurt not the material\nI don’t need a reminder\nOf when things got ugly and we turned bitter\nGo on and take everything from me\nI don’t want stuff from our history\nAnd when I look in the mirror\nI see that I’m finally better\n'Cause you don’t have me\n\nYes, I’m gone, gone\nTake my liberty\nThere’s a price to pay to be free\n'Cause I’m gone, gone\nNo matter how bad you make me feel\nNo matter how hard you try\n\nThe good is back, the good is back, the good is back\nThe good is back , in the word goodbye\nThe good is back, the good is back, the good is back\nThe good is back , in the word goodbye",
