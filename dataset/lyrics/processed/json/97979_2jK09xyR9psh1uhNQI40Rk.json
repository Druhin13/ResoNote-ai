  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Sandy par Rico Nasty\r\nRico\nKennyyyy!\n\nHigh off acid! Fly like Aladdin\nOn the red carpet dressed in high fashion\nRico, \"How you doin'?\" Bitch I’m outstandin'\nYou couldn't get in, so you outside standin’\nI could stand still but my diamonds still dancin'\nHe a hood nigga but I make him a romantic\nI'ma go and get the money like I am a addict\nBefore I went and got a safe, I put it in my attic\n\nHell nah\nI ain't classy, more like sassy\nSmokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy\n\nTaste like candy, hands like Randy\nI'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me\n\nAll these rap niggas be like, \"Damn! Where my song at?\"\nCatch me in the room, I’m smokin’ gas, where the fog at\nTwo-tone, mix-match, they like, \"Where you get that?\"\nYou niggas some pussies, lemme show you where my dogs at\nFuckin' on yo bitch, gotta tell me where her walls at\nHe gave me his number, but he know I ain’t gon' call back\nFall back, if you got a problem we can solve that\nWe do this often, wake you up like coffee in the mornin'\n\nMoney on residuals, so when I sleep it's criminal\nI just hopped in the coupe and dropped the top\nEven though it was thuderin’\nHigh off acid! Alice in Wonderland\nI'ma always go get the ball when you bitches fumble it\n\nHell nah\nI ain't classy, more like sassy\nSmokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy\nTaste like candy, hands like Randy\nI'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me\nI ain't classy, more like sassy\nSmokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy\nTaste like candy, hands like Randy\nI'm original, that's why you bitches can't stand me",
