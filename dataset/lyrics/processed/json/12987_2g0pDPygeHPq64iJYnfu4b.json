  "lyrics": "Champagne in the kitchen not because I bought it but because\r\nI'm crashing an apartment and somebody left it open\r\nSo I poured it in a cup, drank it up\r\nI got the devil in my head but angels swimming in my blood\r\nPlus the conscience of my dead dad\r\nPlus my living mama plus my other father who raised me not to be sad\n\nAnd my brother who says that he worries about me from my songs\n\nAnd my sister who's been living like a saint for so damn long\n\nWhile I've been fucking sinning til the lights come up and mics catch us saying shit that we never really meant\n\nCrew wears all black stuff but we all act like we're so different\n\nBut everybody bleeds right?\n\nEverybody's waiting for the phone to ring\n\nYeah everybody seems fine\n\nBut everybody's got pieces missing\n\nAt minimum I'd like a little medicine to make me feel like everything\n\nDiminishing the venom that been harshing all my mellows I'm continuing to fight against the sentiment that make me want to die\n\nIn a world full of uptight gentlemen I wanna find a boy smelling like sweet cinnamon to quote some Tennyson while we take Benadryl to make my head a bit extra light\n\nI feel it, I want it\n\nI need it, I love it\n\nI'm looking for something\n\nTo make me feel nothing\n\nI feel it, I want it\n\nI need it, I love it\n\nI'm looking for something\n\nTo make me feel nothing\n\nDriving through the bay, pray for understanding\n\nI'll be silent for a day, wait until I vanish and I'm fighting for a break, vacant kind of passion\n\nNever really can account for all the ways in which I've acted\n\nTried to call my daddy but he's been gone a decade so I'm drinking like an addict til I'm fucking with a headache\n\nHappiness sporadic so I'm crying on a Wednesday\n\nNot trying to be combative but I'm dealing with some dead weight\n\nVerbalize the hurt inside make me wanna burn alive\n\nMy heart was never broken it was circumcised",
