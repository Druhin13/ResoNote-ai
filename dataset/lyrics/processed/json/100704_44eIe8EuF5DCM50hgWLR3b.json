  "lyrics": "Jump into the fire\r\nDive in head first into the flames\r\nWe're broken and tired\r\nForgiving it is not the way\r\nHere we are killing ourselves to live\n\nWe just need one more hit\n\nAnd we might just live forever\n\nOh, here we are\n\nWe're going down with this ship\n\nAnd if this is our last trip\n\nAt least we'll go together\n\nWe might just live forever\n\n\n\nHang on to the morning\n\nWatch the wall light up the sky\n\nCave without a warning\n\nWe will be dead before we say die\n\n\n\nHere we are killing ourselves to live\n\nWe just need one more hit\n\nAnd we might just live forever\n\nOh, here we are\n\nWe're going down with this ship\n\nAnd if this is our last trip\n\nAt least we'll go together\n\nWe might just live forever\n\n\n\nBreaking out of the cage and into the fire\n\nChannel the rage, holding it tighter\n\nAnd I'm not ashamed to give into desire\n\nAnd I'm not afraid of the pain that I fight for\n\n\n\nOut of the cage and into the fire\n\nChannel the rage, holding it tighter\n\nAnd I'm not ashamed to give into desire\n\nAnd I'm not afraid of the pain that I fight for\n\n\n\nYeah, ooo\n\nI will fight for you\n\nWin or lose\n\n\n\nHere we are killing ourselves to live\n\nWe just need one more hit\n\nAnd we might just live forever (we might just live forever)\n\nOh, here we are\n\nWe're going down with this ship (going down with this ship)\n\nAnd if this is our last trip\n\nAt least we'll go together (oh, least we'll go together)\n\nWe might just live forever",
