  "lyrics": "Turn up the mic\r\nAnd I'll show you I've got what it takes\r\nTurn off the lights\r\nAnd I'm still going to sparkle up the place\r\nGive me one night\r\nAnd you'll never forget my face\n\nHow'd I come into last place\n\nWhen I'm the fastest one in the race?\n\nTell me why\n\nTell me why can't I reach the finish line?\n\nOoh, tell me why\n\nTell me why [?]\n\nOoh\n\nGive me a world that's color blind\n\nBut mama needs a chance to shine",
