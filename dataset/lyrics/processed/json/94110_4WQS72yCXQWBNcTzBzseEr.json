  "lyrics": "I cannot hold my tongue, you give me much to say\r\nI'm sweating bullets, nervous that you'll push away\r\nAnd when your eyes catch mine, I know I talk too much\r\nSo give me your two lips and baby, I'll shut up\r\nLying on the beach, the middle of December\n\nI'm thinking you're too cool to even remember\n\nMy face, my hair, my eyes, my lips, and my name, hmm\n\nLighting up that clove, your confidence is what I want\n\nI say a lot, I'm loud 'cause maybe you're the one\n\nYour hair, your eyes, your lips, and your name, hmm, baby\n\n\n\nI cannot hold my tongue, you give me much to say\n\nI'm sweating bullets, nervous that you'll push away\n\nAnd when your eyes catch mine, I know I talk too much\n\nSo give me your two lips and baby, I'll shut up\n\n\n\nOh baby, I'll shut up\n\nOh baby, I'll shut up\n\nOh baby, I'll shut up\n\n(Oh baby, I'll shut up)\n\n\n\nYou dress in all black, the middle of the summer\n\nYou're smoother than you think, you rock that Alex Turner\n\nYour style, your arms, wrapped in leather, makes me want you forever (Oh, oh)\n\nBut I cannot break this habit, pure anxiety\n\nStuck here searching for some words that you might need\n\nMaybe you don't need them, it's not what we're about\n\nAnd maybe I'll just slow it down, down, down, down, down\n\n\n\nI cannot hold my tongue, you give me much to say\n\nI'm sweating bullets, nervous that you'll push away\n\nAnd when your eyes catch mine, I know I talk too much\n\nSo give me your two lips and baby, I'll shut up\n\n\n\nOh baby, I'll shut up\n\nOh baby, I'll shut up\n\nOh baby, I'll shut up\n\n(Oh baby, I'll shut up)",
