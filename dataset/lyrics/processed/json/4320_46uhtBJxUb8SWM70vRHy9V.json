  "lyrics": "Please don't speak\r\nDon’t make a peep and wake a vacant spark\r\nPlease don't eek\r\nDon’t make a creek and shake her aching heart\r\nShe's so sweet\r\nDon’t make a scene and break her brazen charm\n\nShe's so weak\n\nJust leave her be a ways away from harm\n\n\n\nStop with gawking\n\nMaking mockeries to seize the light\n\nStop with talk\n\nYour gaping chops will taunt and tease her might\n\nSoft like cotton\n\nBreaking constantly she has tears to wipe\n\nWatch her blossom, oh\n\n\n\nWorth your ear, huh?!\n\nHurts to hear, huh?!\n\n\n\nHold your mutter\n\nIf you love her, leave these dreams to grow\n\nHold your blunder\n\nShe won’t run from greed with reek of hope\n\nFold like butter\n\nUnder summer breeze a pleasing cold\n\nPhony lover, no\n\n\n\nWorth your ear, huh?!\n\nHurts to hear, huh?!\n\nWorth your ear, huh?!\n\nHurts to hear, huh?!\n\n\n\nWait up sir\n\nWhat have you heard?\n\nThat sounds absurd\n\nFor I'm not hurt\n\nI have lost my pearls\n\nBoth my pearls",
