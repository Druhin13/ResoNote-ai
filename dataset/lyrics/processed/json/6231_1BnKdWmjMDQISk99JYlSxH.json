  "lyrics": "I just want to be invisible with you\r\nI drift in and out of time zones with you\r\nJust squeeze me until my skin turns to dark blue\r\nMy pity party's not the same without you\r\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\n\n\nYou're the morning I can't wait to wake to\n\nAfter chasing you through my dreams and gloom\n\nI'll please you until you're sick of me in full\n\nMaybe I can sleep through my mood 'til June\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\n\n\nNow I'm squinting at life through my sad, sour vision\n\nYour silent sting concretely left my face twisted\n\nYour mess in my chest has me stressed and depressed\n\nDo your eyes miss my name\n\nWhen you check all your texts, or not?\n\n\n\nNothing, nothing good comes from late night thinking\n\nDon't you, don't you know it's that gloom boy season\n\nNothing, nothing good comes from late night thinking\n\nI thought I told you it's that gloom boy season\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby\n\nI don't wanna be a crybaby now",
