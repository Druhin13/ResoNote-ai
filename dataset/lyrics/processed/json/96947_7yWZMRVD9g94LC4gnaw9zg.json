  "lyrics": "Baby I know that you gotta go\r\nIt's a whim or a plan either way I hope\r\nThere’s a beach in it\r\nYour Friday nights are barefoot in the sand\r\nThere's music and lights in your left hand\r\nHas a beer in it, yeah I hope the coast is clear in it\n\nOh, I love you and I'll leave it at that\n\nIt’s okay if you don' look back\n\n\n\nIf my '98 Pontiac gets to drivin' through your dreams\n\nGets you flyin' 'round this old town in that same ol' shotgun seat\n\nWhen you open your eyes and that pretty little mind has a memory in it\n\nI hope there's still a little me in it\n\n\n\nYou ain’t got to call, you ain’t got to write\n\nIf the lonely gets you dialin' for my voice one night\n\n’Cause you miss hearin' it, I'll try not to have a tear in it\n\nWon't try to talk you back into us\n\nI’ll keep my mouth and my broken heart shut\n\n\n\nIf my '98 Pontiac gets to drivin' through your dreams\n\nGets you flyin' 'round this old town in that same ol' shotgun seat\n\nWhen you open your eyes and that pretty little mind has a memory in it\n\nI hope there's still a little me in it\n\n\n\nOh, I love you and I'll leave it at that\n\nYeah, I know that you're not comin' back\n\n\n\nIf my '98 Pontiac gets to drivin' through your dreams\n\nGets you flyin' 'round this old town in that same ol' shotgun seat\n\nWhen you open your eyes and that pretty little mind has a memory in it\n\nI hope there's still a little me in it\n\nHope there's still a little me in it",
