  "lyrics": "Everything fell to pieces\r\nWhen my eyes met yours\r\nIn that hospital gown\r\nAnd the dreams we once were dreaming\r\nThat we held so close\r\nFelt impossible now\n\nAnd all the plans we held for the future\n\nAnd all the memories up from the past\n\nThe world I once knew\n\nWas in a cardboard box\n\nIn the lobby lost and found\n\n\n\nHallelujah Nevertheless was the song the pain couldn't destroy\n\nHallelujah Nevertheless you're my joy invincible\n\nJoy invincible, joy\n\nTears were in my eyes when the phone rings\n\nIf only life didn't need us to be this brave\n\nBut we don't live in the world of if only's\n\nStretched tight in between our birth and our graves\n\nHallelujah Nevertheless\n\n\n\nOpen your eyes\n\nLook to the skies\n\nWe are the children of the promise\n\nHold to what’s real\n\nEverything heals\n\nWe are the children of the promise\n\nOpen your heart\n\nLook for the sparks\n\nWe are the children of the promise\n\nLove is your place\n\nFeel the light on your face\n\nWe are the children of the promise\n\n\n\nTears were in my eyes when the phone rings\n\nMaybe it’s your joy that’s giving me strength\n\nYou're my joy invincible\n\nJoy invincible, joy",
