  "lyrics": "No more lazy mornings with you lying next to me\r\nNo more late night talking before we lay our heads to sleep\r\nNo more looking in the mirror with you stepping on my feet\r\nWithout your arms around my shoulders, I’ve lost the strength to be\r\nCome and set me free\n\nWill you stay with me tonight\n\nAnd pretend it’s all alright?\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me\n\nWill you whisper in my ear\n\nThose three words I wanna hear?\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me\n\n\n\nEven if you don’t mean it won't you say I’m still the one?\n\nHide the way that your feeling and make believe I still belong\n\nAnd nothing's changed since you’ve gone\n\n\n\nWill you stay with me tonight\n\nAnd pretend it's all alright?\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me\n\nWill you whisper in my ear\n\nThose three words I wanna hear?\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me\n\n\n\nOne last time to hold you\n\nAnd one last time to tell you\n\nAll the things I should’ve said before\n\nBut just once more...\n\n\n\nWill you stay with me tonight\n\nAnd pretend it's all alright?\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me\n\n(Tell me that you love me)\n\nWill you whisper in my ear\n\nThose three words I wanna hear? (Woah)\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me\n\n\n\nWill you stay with me tonight\n\nAnd pretend it's all alright?\n\nTell me that you love me (Tell me that you love me)\n\nThe way you used to love me (Tell me that you love me)\n\nWill you whisper in my ear (oh)\n\nThose three words I wanna hear?\n\nTell me that you love me\n\nThe way you used to love me",
