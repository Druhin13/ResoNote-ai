  "lyrics": "Like a spotlight the water hits me\r\nRan it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth\r\nThough I know that no one's listening\r\nI nervously rehearse for when you're around\r\nAnd I keep waiting like you might change my mind\n\n\n\nWho wrote the book on goodbye?\n\nThere's never been a way to make this easy\n\nWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right\n\nEither your head or your heart, you set the other on fire\n\n\n\nBack and forth now I'm feelin' guilty\n\nCause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head\n\nThough I know that our time is ending\n\nI'd rather lay forever right in this bed\n\n\n\nAnd I keep waiting like, you might change my mind\n\nGive me one more night\n\n\n\nWho wrote the book on goodbye?\n\nThere's never been a way to make this easy\n\nWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right\n\nEither your head or your heart, you set the other on fire\n\n\n\nNo one knows (knows) \n\nNo one knows (knows)\n\n\n\nWe fell from the peak\n\nAnd the stars, they broke their code\n\nI'm trying to forget\n\nHow I landed on this road\n\nI'm caught in between\n\nWhat I wish and what I know\n\nWhen they say that you just know\n\n\n\nWho wrote the book on goodbye?\n\nThere's never been a way to make this easy\n\nWhen there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right\n\nEither your head or your heart, you set the other on fire\n\n\n\nNo one knows (knows)\n\nNo one knows (knows) \n\nNo one knows (knows) \n\n\n\nYou set the other on fire\n\nYou set the other on fire",
