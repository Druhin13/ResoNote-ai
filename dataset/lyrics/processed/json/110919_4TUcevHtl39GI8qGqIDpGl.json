  "lyrics": "Victimized, scrutanized\r\nI am here to survive\r\nHow you live? (trapped)\r\nHow you die? (trapped)\r\nAll the time is what you really feel inside (trapped)\r\nInsecure (trapped), what you need?\n\nHow you not here to be\n\n1 percent or 99, I want it all\n\nI swear to God, by myself\n\nAnxiety, anxiousness, misery\n\nLose your dreams, lose your mind\n\nI can travel inside my mind like all the time\n\nDo what I gotta do to get into your vibe\n\nNo right or wrong been moving when we moving right\n\nSay my name in the mirror 30 times\n\nWhen this song is over, we will lead a normal life\n\n\n\nThese eyes, they won't be fake, no\n\nScrewed up, but I'll be gentle\n\nBeen drivin,' been drinkin'\n\nLord help me, this is not right\n\nState your claims and play your games\n\nThis is no rap embrace\n\nWe just rhyme, press rewind\n\nLet's replay, and let's get down\n\nThese eyes, they won't be fake, no\n\nScrewed up, but I'll be gentle\n\nBeen drivin,' been drinkin'\n\nLord help me, this is not right\n\nState your claims and play your games\n\nThis is no rap embrace\n\nWe just rhyme, press rewind\n\nLet's replay, and let's get down\n\n\n\nLet's get down, let's replay\n\nLet's get down, let's replay\n\nI see happy people\n\n\n\nIn the middle of no where I see happy people\n\nIn the middle of no where the bloodsheds thy people\n\nIn the middle of no where I see happy people\n\nIn the middle of no where the bloodsheds thy people\n\n\n\nI woke up this morning and I asked myself;\n\n\"Is life worth living, should I blast myself?\n\nAnd when I'm gone would they remember?\"\n\nOnly son of Deborah, born in late December\n\nWould my women cry for me when they get the news\n\nThat they future baby daddy\n\nHanging from a noose\n\nI don't wanna cry, be a better way\n\nDon't ever want to see her die, so I found an escape\n\nShould I leap in head first off the fire escape\n\nOr should I take the easy way, shoot myself in the face\n\nI can't really explain\n\nWhat got me feelin' this way\n\nTo all my fans, I'm truly sorry that I have to end it\n\nBut keep your minds open, and my verses in your memory\n\nIn disbelieve, at least I made it to a quarter century\n\nJust tryna give you a good ending for the documentary\n\nI won't give you reasons why I had to do it\n\nJust know I'm going through it\n\nAnd I really had to do it\n\nGet it together, fuck is you doin'\n\nGod got my number blocked\n\nMy calls, he never answered\n\nWho's to blame, myself, the bullet or the handgun\n\nThe night time's the hardest time to be alive\n\nOnly sleepin' with women I love\n\nI got insomnia\n\nI got a bad case of 4 A.M. regrets\n\nYou know, like when you can't sleep, layin' in your bed\n\nReplaying all them things you wish you never did\n\nVoices in my head, sleep paralysis\n\nCountin' sheep all week\n\nI'm half-past dead\n\nVision clouded\n\nVoices, whispers, are they talkin' about me",
