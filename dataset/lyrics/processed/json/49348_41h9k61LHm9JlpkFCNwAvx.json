  "lyrics": "I'll go anywhere easy\r\nNew York or to the noose\r\nApproach slow, cavalier-y\r\nLike a frontline soldier who's\r\nLost home many years ago\r\nWell I know\n\nI put a swollen hand on the bible\n\nYea I know\n\nI lost my only hand in Chicago\n\n\n\nBut I'm with you\n\nWhen the Dunlop blew on the interstate\n\nAnd you're stuck in Indiana a second day\n\nOn your way back to Cinci for winter break\n\nI put you in a mantra, meditate\n\n'Cause we got history\n\nAnd it's no mystery\n\nBreathe in and out and go easy\n\n\n\nEasy anywhere I go\n\nNeed no thing, travel slow\n\nAlways tinged in sadness\n\nLike an elephant in a tent show\n\nIn sync with a song as the credits roll\n\nOh I know\n\nFeels like a frozen hand on your shoulder\n\nYea I know\n\nIt's like a cold black hold on your shoulder\n\n\n\n'Cause that's you\n\nWith a sack of DQ at the cemetery\n\nLost in a tabloid magazine\n\nOn a boy whose been dead for a century\n\nI saw you out the back of my limousine\n\nOoo Baby\n\nBut it don't phase me\n\nI go anywhere easy\n\n\n\nDo you still remember me?",
