  "lyrics": "Squinting from blinding rays of the Sun, deep in the heart of July\r\nThere to perform for children of corn, whose crops stood well Twelve foot high\r\nThree knaves remained to the end of the day, we refused their vile entreats\r\nStanding our ground, we played for the ears between the harvester's teeth\r\nGreat Plains, hardcore scenes\n\nMay not be the biggest but, lord, they're mean\n\nAnd though my mind has been shot to hell\n\nThe details of that night I remember well\n\n\n\nGravel and locust, they swore to rope us\n\nWe did our best to steer straight\n\nTrailer and hitch, straight into the ditch\n\nPraying to Jesus and the holy saints\n\nDespite the violence, sometimes I look back\n\nA nostalgia begins to take hold\n\nWisdom of sorts is found in due course\n\nIn the rows of silver and gold\n\n\n\nGimme the keys, they can keep the guarantee\n\nGimme the keys, and get the hell out of dodge\n\n\n\nHey man, we don't got your, we don't got your SM-57\n\nLook dude, why don't you try some old-fashioned PMA\n\n\n\nThrough bloody butchers, we ran for hours\n\nThen hours grew into years\n\nStalked by the fury of John Brown's eyes\n\nAnd still the storm hasn't cleared\n\nDespite the mileage, sometimes I look back\n\nA nostalgia begins to take hold\n\nWisdom of sorts is found, of course, in rows of silver and gold\n\n\n\nGreat Plains, hardcore scenes\n\nMay not be the biggest but, lord, they're mean\n\nAnd though my mind has been shot to hell\n\nThe details of that night I remember well\n\n\n\nGimme the keys, they can keep the guarantee\n\nGimme the keys, and get the hell out of dodge",
