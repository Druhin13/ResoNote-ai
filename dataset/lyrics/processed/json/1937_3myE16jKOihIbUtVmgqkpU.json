  "lyrics": "Strolling down the highway with my shoes in my hand\r\nI don't talk much I'm a quiet man\r\nBeauty and silence both run deep\r\nAnd running like crazy while you are asleep\r\nChorus:\n\nYou got news for me, I got nothing for you\n\nDon't pin your blues on me\n\nJust go ahead and do whatever you wish to\n\n\n\nLast Monday night I saw a fight\n\nBetween Wednesday and Thursday over Saturday night\n\nTuesday asked me what was going on I said,\n\n\"Sunday's in the meadow and Friday's in the corn.\"\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nHocus-pocus, Maladjusted\n\nDon't you think my tears get rusted\n\nSteady losing means you ain't using\n\nWhat you really think is right\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nOodles of light what a beautiful sight\n\nBoth of God's eyes are shining tonight\n\nRays and beams of incredible dreams\n\nAnd I am a quiet man.\n\n\n\nOodles of light what a beautiful sight\n\nBoth of God's eyes are shining tonight\n\nRays and beams of incredible dreams\n\nAnd I am a quiet man.\n\n\n\nOodles of light what a beautiful sight\n\nBoth of God's eyes are shining tonight\n\nRays and beams of incredible dreams\n\nAnd I am a quiet man.",
