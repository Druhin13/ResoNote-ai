  "lyrics": "Life is never easy when you need it to be\r\nTry to knock me down, but I get back on my feet\r\nEverybody's angry and they're coming for me (Coming for me)\r\nBut I can't give them energy that I won't receive (I won't receive)\r\nSo I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve\r\nLike I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat\n\nThis place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe\n\nI hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory\n\n\n\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n\nI'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today\n\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n\nI'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today\n\n\n\nKnow it's real, take your time, you're almost there\n\nWherever we’re going, gotta be prepared\n\nWe’ll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?\n\nPeople keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be\n\nWalking down the line, but they don’t live what they preach (Live what they preach)\n\nSharing attributes with all our own enemies\n\nYou gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free\n\n\n\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n\n(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give in)\n\nI'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today\n\n(Yeah, and I won't give in, won't give in)\n\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n\n(No, I won't give up, no, I won't give in, no no)\n\nI'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah\n\n\n\nYou gotta take it slow (Alright)\n\nDust yourself off, don’t you lose control (Yeah, mmm)\n\nGotta take it slow\n\nDust yourself off, don’t you lose control\n\n(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)\n\nYou gotta take it slow (Oh)\n\nDust yourself off, don’t you lose control\n\n(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)\n\nGotta take it slow\n\nDust yourself off, don’t you lose control\n\n(Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control)\n\n\n\n'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face\n\n\n\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\n\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\n\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\n\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\n\nHundred days and I'm still alive\n\nHundred days and I'm still alive\n\nIts been a hundred, mmm\n\nHundred, hundred days and I'm still alive\n\nGot a hundred friends, but I'll cut em off, I don’t need em\n\nNot like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing\n\nSummer's over so they switching around like the seasons\n\nGotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense\n\nEverybody wants a favor, everybody needs me\n\nBut I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons\n\nI'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons\n\nEverybody wants a favor, everybody needs me\n\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\n\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\n\nOutta sight, outta mind, got no time\n\nSo blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life\n\nHundred days and I'm still alive\n\nHundred days and I'm still alive\n\nIts been a hundred, mmm\n\nHundred, hundred days and I'm still alive",
