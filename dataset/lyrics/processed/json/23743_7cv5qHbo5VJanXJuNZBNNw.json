  "lyrics": "It seems we're headed for a total breakdown\r\nIt keeps on getting harder to connect\r\nIf this is not a war between the sexes\r\nWell then some kind of hex is in effect\r\nThe ones we used to call the happy couple\n\nHave given up on romance altogether\n\nHow that perfect one could come undone\n\nLooks like love's in for a run of nasty weather\n\n\n\nLines are down, streets are redded\n\nPipes cracked, apartments gutted\n\nThe tough are gettin' goin', 'cause the goin's gettin' tough\n\nEverybody's breakin' up\n\n\n\nIt seems we've come upon some kind of impasse\n\nAn ending to this fractured fairy tale\n\nWhat once upon a time were little home sweet homes\n\nAre now just houses up for sale\n\n\n\nStreets ahush, a grim reminder\n\nNo lovers laughter, no organ grinder\n\nHe's out of work, the monkey run off with the cup\n\nSeems like everybody's breakin' up\n\n\n\nSeven year itch, or mid-life crisis\n\nWe're comin' unhitched, goin' back to old vices\n\n\n\nThe tough are gettin' goin' cause the goin's gettin' tough\n\nEverybody's breakin' up",
