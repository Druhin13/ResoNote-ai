  "lyrics": "I need you baby\r\nMore than you'll ever, ever know\r\nWhat keeps you waiting?\r\nLet's take our time just moving slow\r\nI'm so lonely, feeling heavy love\n\nYou're just so far from where I want you now\n\n\n\nCome on now, baby\n\nYou speak so soft and low\n\nCome on now, baby\n\nYou think that I don't know\n\nI need some honey\n\nCome on now, baby\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you\n\nThat there's a fight on every corner\n\nThey'll keep you wavering\n\nUntil you've reached some modern road\n\nIt's not just lazy\n\nThere's just some things you're never told\n\n\n\nIt can't be this heavy love\n\nWe'll have to wear our fears so everyone\n\nCan see it too\n\n\n\nCome on now, baby\n\nYou speak so soft and low\n\nCome on now, baby\n\nYou think that I don't know\n\nI need some honey\n\nCome on now, baby",
