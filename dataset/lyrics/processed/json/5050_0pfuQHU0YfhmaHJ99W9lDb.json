  "lyrics": "Mindless eyes\r\nTightening veins beneath my skin\r\nForming shapes within my dreams\r\nJaded thought, it rips my throat\r\nI live under my skin\n\nI suppose you pray for me\n\n\n\nI’m tainted, it’s over\n\nI’m tainted, it’s over\n\nThe feelings that I have\n\nFor you, but keep them deep inside\n\nIn the heart\n\nFrom deep within my skin\n\nThere’s not that much time for you\n\nThis time I’m afraid to wander the world\n\nI’m not sure, I don’t think so\n\n\n\nI will pretend\n\nTo live without my skin\n\nI will pretend\n\nTo live without my skin\n\n\n\nTake another piece of me\n\nAnd it just might be enough to drag me under\n\nBeneath the waves\n\nTake another bite from this\n\nWhite-lipped corpse\n\n\n\nTake another bite from me\n\nAnd wait your turn\n\nIt just might be enough to drag me under\n\nTake another bite from this\n\nWhite-lipped corpse\n\nAnd it just might be enough to drag me under\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the dust begins to fall\n\nI see an image of it all\n\nIt keeps me awake, keeps me awake\n\n\n\nSeparated from the earth\n\nLights flicker then are burned\n\nIt keeps me awake, keeps me awake\n\n\n\nLightning struck into a mirror image of the truth\n\nIt keeps me awake, oh, it keeps me awake\n\nThe stars begin to fall, a meditation to absolve\n\nIt keeps me awake, oh, it keeps me awake\n\n\n\nI’m half crazy\n\nSearching for the sight of you\n\nHoping that you’d pull me through\n\nThe hand of God you forced me to\n\nI’m half crazy\n\nLonging for the love of you\n\nBegging on my knees to you\n\nWeeping for the honest truth\n\n\n\nI’ve been dreaming\n\nLove is not an endless thing\n\nAnxious to ignore our feelings\n\nLove is not an endless thing\n\nI’ve been dreaming\n\nLove is not an endless thing\n\nAnxious to ignore our feelings\n\nLove is not an endless thing",
