  "lyrics": "And we stand naked and deep\r\nIn another place\r\nAnd you fall into me\r\nUnderneath the weight\r\nAnd you call me oblique\r\nAs if you never needed someone\n\nAnd you fall into me\n\n\n\nSo nod your eyes, ooh\n\nSo nod your eyes, mmh\n\n\n\nYou'll be happy\n\nIf I ever walk the line\n\nBaby you'll see\n\nCatching pieces\n\nFaded in the stars of me\n\nAnd wake me up\n\nI don't ever wanna wake up anymore\n\nOh-oh, oh\n\n\n\nFace down in the water\n\nI called you again\n\nAs if I was younger\n\nAnd everything I ever thought\n\nWas true when grown\n\nAs if you didn't know that\n\nThat you called me oblique\n\nThicker than water\n\nAnd you call out to me\n\n\n\nSo nod your eyes, ooh\n\nSo nod your eyes\n\n\n\nYou'll be happy\n\nIf I ever walk the line\n\nBaby you'll see\n\nCatching pieces\n\nFaded in the stars of me\n\nAnd wake me up\n\nI don't ever wanna wake up anymore\n\nNo, oh\n\nNo, no\n\n\n\nI don't wanna wake up, start anew\n\nI just wanna wake up, start anew\n\nI don't wanna wake up, start anew\n\nI just wanna wake up\n\n\n\nAnd this moment with point of view\n\nThe light just beaming around you in the cold\n\nYou know my heart will come back to you\n\nAnd flow right back with all the hues of the fall\n\nYou're a perennial, mmh",
