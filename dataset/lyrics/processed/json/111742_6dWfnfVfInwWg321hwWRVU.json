  "lyrics": "This little cup had given up\r\nAll out of luck, his heart struck\r\nAnd the Devil plays his little game\r\nSuch a tragedy\r\nAnd the world we knew was painted black\r\nNow take it back, you attack\n\nJust prepare your boots for an adventure, it's in the bag\n\nThey made the gravest of mistakes\n\nDoomed by the eyes of a snake\n\nYou must rejoice with your old chum\n\nAs you run and gun\n\nUp in the clouds and on the ground\n\nInward bound, so profound\n\nMake 'em pay the price for taking over\n\n\n\nWith the luck of a four-leaf clover\n\nThrough the hills of apocalypse\n\nYou'll saturate this whole place with your magic fingertips\n\nLike an eternal eclipse, you shine\n\nSo make it rain!\n\n\n\nBrothers in arms, they will run\n\nThey colour up the rainbow that bangs on the drums\n\nThe fable will prevail as our heroes travel far\n\nIn this cartoon universe, you're a pest\n\nNow put me to the test\n\n\n\nOur paths foretell of many heights\n\nOn the ground or take flight\n\nThere's a problem dwelling over there\n\nFor those who even dare\n\nFor you see, this cryptic renegade\n\nWith your friend, there's no shade\n\nWill they face the big battle royale? (You've got it, pal!)\n\nWith fingers like projectiles, make the boss infantile\n\nThese monsters hail from the dread\n\nThey've come to take your head\n\nMay God enlighten your road, may your journey behold\n\nTry not to slip through the riverside\n\n\n\nThe weather brings hell to the tides\n\nAs the Devil would lick his lips\n\nYou overcome this homicide with your magic fingertips\n\nLike an eternal eclipse, you shine\n\nSo make it rain!\n\n\n\nBrothers in arms, they will run\n\nThey colour up the rainbow that bangs on the drums\n\nThe fable will prevail as our heroes travel far\n\nIn this cartoon universe, you're a pest\n\nNow put me to the test\n\n\n\nAh, see, the roulette spins\n\nYou're seriously out of luck\n\nYou sold your soul and took the toll\n\nThis is my hell, you shmucks\n\nBut the price you'll pay to end this day\n\nSets challenges far and wide\n\nFor the time will come, your journey is done\n\nYou found out I lied, hahahahaha!\n\n\n\nWhat will we do?\n\nLet's form our crew, let's bring this back to life!\n\n\n\nBrothers in arms, they will run\n\nThey colour up the rainbow that bangs on the drums\n\nThe fable will prevail as our heroes travel far\n\nIn this cartoon universe, you're a pest\n\nAnd when they both save the day\n\nThe tyranny will die, so they will swing and sway\n\nUntil the roll of film comes to a sudden end\n\nThe story descends into our history\n\n\n\n(What will we do? Let's form our crew)\n\n(Let's bring this back to life)\n\nLike an eternal eclipse, you shine",
