  "lyrics": "Mama's so strong but her body's tired\r\nBut she jumps up to hug me when I come home\r\nAnd Dad hates the smoke, but he chews tobacco\r\nAnd he taught me to find God on my own\r\nAnd Kendal is no stranger to trouble\r\nBut her boys are gonna love that crazy soul\n\nBoy, Britney's still scared from after ?\n\nBut if Andrew was here, he'd be proud of her\n\n\n\nSo maybe love was always near\n\nMaybe love needs the fear\n\nWell maybe love is a broken thing\n\nMaybe love needs nothing\n\n\n\nSo I chain smoke the pack in Salt Lake City\n\nAnd your voice sounds the same when I'm alone\n\nI was drunk at the wheel in North of Virginia\n\nOh and I came to tears thinking of her\n\nOh and darling I know that I haven't told you\n\nBut you mean more to me than you must know\n\nBut my head's full of fear and my heart of sorrow\n\nBut when I'm patient enough, you've always said go\n\n\n\nSo maybe love was always near\n\nMaybe love needs the fear\n\nWell maybe love is a broken thing\n\nMaybe love needs nothing\n\n\n\nIt's carrying you, It's carrying you\n\nDon't let it go, I'm so far away\n\nIt's carrying you, It's carrying you\n\nDon't let it go, I'm so far away",
