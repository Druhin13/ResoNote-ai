  "lyrics": "There was a time when I was able\r\nTo sit down at the table\r\nWith the ones that I loved most in life\r\nNow my days have grown so bitter\r\nLord knows it get no better\r\nI'm so tired of being lonely all the time\n\n\n\nNo glamor and no gold\n\nJust give me someone dear to hold\n\nWhen the nights have gone so cold\n\nAnd I haven't got a dime\n\nJust think of me, and you'll think better\n\nLike a diamond lasts forever\n\nI'm so tired of being lonely all the time\n\n\n\nI'm so tired (I'm so tired)\n\nOf driving down the same old street\n\nWhere the same old empty house\n\nGreets me when I come home\n\nAnd I'm so tired (I'm so tired)\n\nOf waking up to old, cold coffee I made yesterday\n\nMorning after morning\n\n\n\nSo if the feelings that I'm feeling\n\nCould bring you home to me this evening\n\nLong before the sun gives way to another lonely night\n\nI would shout and I would cry\n\nI would bid bad times goodbye\n\n'Cause I'm so tired of being lonely all the time",
