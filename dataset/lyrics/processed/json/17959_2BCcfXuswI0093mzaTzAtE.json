  "lyrics": "You call me up to let me know, just how good you've been doing\r\nI don't wanna let it show but I can't keep pretending\r\nI bet you think that I've moved on but I can't move since you've been gone\r\nAnd I can't believe that we said it and now you won't let me forget it\r\nDon't tell me that you're going out tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\nDon't tell me that you're all alone tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\n\n\nIt's getting harder not to fool, 'cause I love how you fool me\n\nThere's a lovely lonely road, I'm lying where you left me\n\nTake my heart and take my gold, leave what's left and let me go\n\nIt's hard to believe that you said it and now you won't let me forget it\n\n\n\nDon't tell me that you're going out tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\nDon't tell me that you're all alone tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\nThat tonight you're getting out with your friends\n\nAnd how you wish it was me, not them, yeaaaah\n\n\n\nDon't tell me that you're going out tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\nDon't tell me that you're all alone tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\n\n\nDon't tell me that you're going out tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know\n\nDon't tell me that you're all alone tonight\n\nDon't tell me 'cause I, I don't wanna know",
