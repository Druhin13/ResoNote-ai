  "lyrics": "Even in the water\r\nYou are so soft in the corner\r\nSoft where you shouldn't be\r\nAnd I just died for it every time\r\nIf there was a warning bell\n\nI'd know\n\nBut all I hear is music\n\nSoft and low\n\n\n\nNever see it coming\n\nI never see it coming on\n\nI never see it coming\n\nI always look the wrong way 'round\n\n\n\nEven when the wind blows\n\nI whisper light as a feather\n\nSame as it ever was\n\nBut I was never good at levitating\n\n\n\nIf there was a warning bell\n\nI'd know\n\nBut all I hear is music\n\nSoft and low\n\n\n\nI never see it coming\n\nI never see it coming on\n\nI never see it coming\n\nI always look the wrong way 'round\n\n\n\nI have loved to save us\n\nI tend to trust the villain\n\nI've been fine with learning it the hard way\n\n\n\nBut I will stop and listen\n\nRemind myself a cautious heart\n\nIs a trophy I'm worthy of\n\n\n\nI never see it coming\n\n\n\nIf there was a warning bell\n\nI'd know\n\nBut all I hear is music\n\nSoft and low\n\n\n\nI never see it coming\n\nI never see it coming on\n\nI never see it coming\n\nI always look the wrong way 'round",
