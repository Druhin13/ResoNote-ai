  "lyrics": "Now, Tommy's a good father\r\nTwo sons and a daughter\r\nBut he wakes up and he asks himself:\r\n\"Why even bother?\"\r\nIf he cannot feed his family\r\nThe wage he's paid's insanity\n\nEvery day he's dealing with a new calamity\n\n\n\nLost his old occupation\n\nBut it wasn't immigration\n\nIt was a machine, automation that replaced him\n\nPoliticians left him, corruption since the recession\n\nSo he grabs his Smith and Wesson, says he'll teach 'em all the lesson like:\n\n\n\n\"Get down on the ground!\n\nIt's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!\n\nDon't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!\n\nI'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!\n\nLet it rain over Washington!\n\nIt's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!\n\nDon't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!\n\nI'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!\n\nLet it rain over Washington!\"\n\n\n\nNow first he'd lost his pension\n\nSunk into depression\n\nCongress is defecting\n\nIt's been adding to the tension\n\nCame back from war, and he's been post-traumatic stressing\n\nCan't afford his medicine he took for his aggression\n\nHe needs help, relying on this system that rejects him\n\nTook away his benefits, but left him with his weapon\n\nBought a one way ticket\n\nHe's entering the thicket\n\nTo do the only thing that he's thinking will make a difference like:\n\n\n\n\"Get down on the ground!\n\nIt's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!\n\nDon't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round\n\nI'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!\n\nLet it rain over Washington!\n\nIt's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!\n\nDon't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!\n\nI'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!\n\nLet it rain over Washington!\"\n\n\n\nThere's a cold wind blowing\n\nI'm just warning and preparing ya\n\nThere's a cold wind blowing\n\nAnd it's coming for America\n\nAnd it's coming for America\n\n\n\nAnd it's coming for America\n\n\n\n\"Get down on the ground!\n\nIt's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!\n\nDon't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!\n\nI'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!\n\nLet it rain over Washington!\n\nIt's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!\n\nDon't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!\n\nI'm done playing games, so I'm going down in flames!\n\nLet it rain over Washington!\"",
