Nah\n\nThey don't want that fate, no\n\nThey won't take that place, yeah\n\nGotta get mine from the love from below and above in the mud\n\nAnd the mind of a kind but I'm tryna relax\n\nBut design all the time like floods\n\nIf you see me from the high road, more Tzatziki on my Gyro\n\n\n\nGimme the mic (whatchu want?)
