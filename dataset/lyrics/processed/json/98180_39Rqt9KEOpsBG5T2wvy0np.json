Has it started to torture you?\n\nTraveling so far to get there\n\nAll just to be here again\n\nAll just to see what they saw back then\n\n\n\nWell, you could put it all on me\n\nYeah, you could put it all on me\n\nOh, you could put it all on me\n\n\n\nI found a way I could catch that feel good\n\nSkies been turnin', fires been burnin' since '93",
