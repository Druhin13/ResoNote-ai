  "lyrics": "I watched you bleed out\r\nI watched your lungs cave\r\nI saw that worst thing that I've ever seen as I watched you slip away from me\r\nAnd our daughters first breath is the last one you will ever take and I don't think I can make it on my own\r\nRemember they said you'd have to sacrifice I know\n\nBut I was not prepared to watch the life drain from your soul\n\nI have never felt so crushed, the sadness buried in my bones\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to raise a daughter on my own\n\n\n\nI turn to stone when I look in your eyes\n\nI lost the only reason that I'm alive\n\nI don't know if any words will do(will do)\n\nAll that I know is I'm so in love with you\n\n\n\nThere was nothing that they could do\n\nAfter 3 days of labor it's a miracle that anyone survived\n\nI'm alive, but I'm dead inside and I'm supposed to raise a child with a smile now\n\n\n\nI used to wonder why people put bullets in their brains\n\nNow it seems like the only way to stop this pain\n\nHow the fuck am I supposed to wake up every day\n\nAnd pretend that I love her as much as I miss your face\n\n\n\nI turn to stone when I look in your eyes\n\nI lost the only reason that I'm alive\n\nI don't know if any words will do(will do)\n\nAll that I know is I'm so in love with you\n\n\n\nI watched you bleed out\n\nI watched your lungs cave\n\nI watched you slip away from me and I don't that I'll ever be OK",
