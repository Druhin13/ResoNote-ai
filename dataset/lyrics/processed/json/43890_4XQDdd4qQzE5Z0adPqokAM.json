  "lyrics": "My love, I will always love you\r\nBut never will I forgive you\r\nFor being gone for so long\r\nMy heart, forever a little broken\r\nSo many nights I've woken\n\nFrom a dream that you came back to me\n\n\n\nSo won't you please, please\n\nPlease, please, please\n\nPlease, please, please, please\n\nRelease me\n\n\n\nI've been the best at doing the best that I can\n\nI've spent my life in the shadow of a man\n\nNow I want to be the writer of this song\n\nAnd a love, not just a longing\n\nIn a world that is just calling me to be free\n\n\n\nOnly I know what we had between us\n\nSome people don't believe us\n\nThe things that have been spoken\n\nWould leave anyone heartbroken\n\n\n\nBut never mind I'm still a survivor\n\nBut I'm begging to be lighter\n\nIt's all on me to set this free\n\n\n\nSo won't you please, please\n\nPlease, please, please\n\nPlease, please, please, please\n\nRelease me\n\n\n\nI've lived, I've lived, I've lived\n\nFor more than two of your lives\n\nI've lived to move these mountains aside\n\nI've lived just by staying alive\n\n\n\nSo won't you please, please\n\nPlease, please, please\n\nPlease, please, please, please\n\nRelease me\n\nRelease me",
