  "lyrics": "Poured my glass of wine\r\nYou caught me some fireflies\r\nTold me their names\r\nAnd how much they love their life in a jar\r\nYou twist around me like vines\r\nYou rub the stars in my bright eyes\n\nThen you sold me a future\n\nFrom the ones you had in the trunk of your car\n\n\n\nYou said I think too much\n\nYou said I always mess it up\n\nIt was so easy to believe\n\nI've always said the same things\n\n\n\nStay out, honey, I can see you're wicked\n\nAnd I don't want your wicked love\n\nDon't need what makes me feel addicted\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nStay out, stay out\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nStay out, stay out\n\nI don't want your wicked, wicked, wicked love\n\n\n\nYou thought I didn't notice\n\nYou had me caught like a firefly\n\nI'd abandoned my flight\n\nTo be crawling around with these wings\n\nBut I won't forget this moment (Wait until you see)\n\nAnd how mighty the truth can be\n\nHow her hammer and nails\n\nChisel beauty from grotesque things\n\n\n\nYou say I think too much\n\nTell me I always mess it up\n\nWell, I'll break the glass and see\n\nIf the fireflies agree\n\n\n\nStay out, honey, I can see you're wicked\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nDon't need what makes me feel addicted\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nStay out, stay out\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nStay out, stay out\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nI don't want your wicked love\n\nDon't need what makes me feel addicted\n\nI don't want your wicked, wicked, wicked love\n\n\n\nWait until you see\n\nHow mighty the truth can be\n\nLike an ocean of light\n\nIt's a sky filled with fireflies",
