  "lyrics": "You're just a world\r\nOnly the world away\r\nIt all rolls into one and I will fade away\r\nThis universe where I've been doomed to lay\r\nEmpty, it goes to waste\r\nFalling on every sword\n\n\n\nI'm not ready to let go\n\nIt's too painful\n\nTime, it moves so slow\n\nHow the story goes\n\nI follow you, yes, blindly\n\nYou take it all so lightly\n\nI'm [?] by\n\n\n\n(I'm not ready)\n\nI'm not ready to let go\n\nIt's too painful",
