  "lyrics": "I should have known I'd be about it.\r\nI should of read the burn another way.\r\nI could of proved the point to play down\r\nI could of used another getaway.\r\nI could of turned this time around.\r\nI could of turned this time around again\n\nI should of made you take a drive.\n\nI should of made this go another way.\n\n\n\nI know that you're hurt from the start of the day.\n\nMove everything and we'll go far away,\n\nWhere no one will find us, and no one will care.\n\nLet all these emotions burn up in the air\n\nCause false or forsaken we're stuck in this hole.\n\nRude self-discoveries we're not in control.\n\nIt's not the timing, it's not the time for goodbyes.\n\nUntil I kiss her.\n\n\n\nI could of made your crying go away.\n\nI should've turned to you that one day\n\nYour son is good enough to read a lie.\n\nI should've read that burn another way.\n\nI say let's fuck it all and run away.\n\nI could've stopped it turning out this way.\n\nLet's steal a car and take a drive.\n\nWe'll crash and burn and then make our way down (down and burn).\n\n\n\nLosing yourself all these thoughts in your head\n\nYou're so much better to lose them instead.\n\nSit down your mothers and let them explain\n\nAll this means nothing if you're still in pain.\n\nSo false and forsaken we're stuck in this hole.\n\nRude self-discoveries we're not in control.\n\nIt's not your timing, it's not your time for goodbye.\n\n\n\nI wish I would have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I could have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I would have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I could have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I would have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I could have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I would have seen you coming.\n\nI wish I could have seen you coming.",
