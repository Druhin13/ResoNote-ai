  "lyrics": "I'm sorry that I did this\r\nThe blood is on my hands\r\nI stare at my reflection\r\nI don't know who I am\r\nPractice my confession\r\nIn case I take the stand\n\nI'll say I learned my lesson\n\nI'll be a better man\n\n\n\nI'm packing up my things and\n\nI'm wiping down the walls\n\nI'm rinsing off my clothes and\n\nI'm walking through the halls\n\nI did it all for her\n\nSo I felt nothing at all\n\nI don't know what she'll say\n\nSo I'll ask her when she calls\n\n\n\nWould you love me more\n\nIf I killed someone for you\n\nWould you hold my hand\n\nThey're the same ones that I used\n\nWhen I killed someone for you\n\n\n\nWould you turn me in\n\nWhen they say I'm on the loose\n\nWould you hide me when\n\nMy face is on the news\n\nCause I killed someone for you\n\n\n\nI hear the sirens coming\n\nI see the flashing lights\n\nI'm driving through the suburbs\n\nWearing my disguise\n\nI show up at her door step\n\nTo look her in the eyes\n\nI tell her that it's me\n\nBut she doesn't recognize\n\nCan't you see I'm running\n\nSaid I need a place to hide\n\nI've gotta ask you something\n\nCould you please let me inside\n\nJust let me explain\n\nNo, I wouldn't tell you lies\n\nI know you'll understand\n\nIf you let me stay the night\n\n\n\nWould you love me more\n\nIf I killed someone for you\n\nWould you hold my hand\n\nThey're the same ones that I used\n\nWhen I killed someone for you\n\n\n\nWould you turn me in\n\nWhen they say I'm on the loose\n\nWould you hide me when\n\nMy face is on the news\n\nCause I killed someone for you\n\n\n\nYou have to understand that\n\nThe one I killed is me\n\nChanging what I was\n\nFor what you wanted me to be\n\nI followed your direction\n\nDid everything you asked\n\nI hope it makes you happy\n\nCause there's just no turning back\n\n\n\nWould you love me more\n\nIf I killed someone for you\n\nWould you hold my hand\n\nThey're the same ones that I used\n\nWhen I killed someone for you\n\n\n\nWould you turn me in\n\nWhen they say I'm on the loose\n\nWould you hide me when\n\nMy face is on the news\n\nCause I killed someone for you",
