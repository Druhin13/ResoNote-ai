  "lyrics": "When the song comes on\r\nWhen I hear them say\r\nEverything stops\r\nEverything changes\r\nThere's nothing special now\r\nIt's nothing profound\n\nBut something about the way it sounds\n\nWhen the melody ends\n\nAnd the rhythm kicks in\n\nIt knows where I'm at\n\nAnd it knows where I've been\n\n\n\nThat's when I call you up\n\nThat's when my river overflows\n\nThat's when I use my cash card\n\nThat's when I think of who you are\n\n\n\nThat's when there's a knock at the door\n\nAnd that's what we're doing it for\n\nWell that's I got your message\n\nThat's when I sing this song\n\nThat's when he says it's over\n\nThat's when my life is in your hands now\n\n\n\nThat's when I call you up\n\nThat's when my river overflows\n\nThat's when I use my cash card\n\nThat's when I think of who you are\n\n\n\nThis is when\n\nThis is now\n\nThis is that\n\nThis is how\n\nThis is what\n\nThis is then\n\nThis is where",
