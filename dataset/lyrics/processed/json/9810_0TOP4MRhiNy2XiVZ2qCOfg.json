  "lyrics": "I woke up, but was far from home\r\nLiving a life that was not my own\r\nOh, oh\r\nPlaces familiar but they are not the same\r\nA house of strangers who will know my name\r\nOh, oh\n\n\n\nI wait for the penny drop, hey !\n\nI'm never going to give you up my love\n\nBlack rainbows never stop, hey !\n\nI'm never going to give you up my love\n\n\n\nWhispers and lies\n\nThe ghost in your eyes\n\nThey burn paradise\n\nBlack rainbows for miles\n\n\n\nTurn up the volume all the way it goes\n\nThere's only silence on the radio\n\nOh, oh\n\nForgot the songs that I used to know\n\nI had it all but I let it go\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\nI wait for the penny drop, hey !\n\nI'm never going to give you up my love\n\nBlack rainbows never stop, hey !\n\nI'm never going to give you up my love\n\n\n\nWhispers and lies\n\nThe ghost in your eyes\n\nThey burn paradise\n\nBlack rainbows for miles\n\n\n\nIf your ever feeling lonely\n\nDon't give up the blue sky\n\nLeave the static far below\n\nThat's what you told me oh so many times.",
