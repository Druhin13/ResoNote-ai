  "lyrics": "I woke up this morning with the sundown shining in\r\nFound my mind with the brown paper bag within\r\nTripped on a cloud, fell in eight miles high\r\nI tore my mind on a jagged sky\r\nI just dropped in to see what my condition was in\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\n\n\nTo see what condition, to see what condition\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\nTo see what condition, to see what condition\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\n\n\nI pushed my soul in a deep, dark hole, and then I followed it in\n\nI watched myself crawling out as I was crawling in, oh\n\nI got up so tight I couldn't unwind\n\nI saw so much that it broke my mind\n\nI just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in\n\n\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\n\n\nTo see what condition, to see what condition\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in\n\nTo see what condition, to see what condition\n\nTo see what condition my condition was in",
