  "lyrics": "Why do you hurt yourself?\r\nYou do it very well\r\nYou do it so politely\r\nThat you couldn't even tell\r\nWhen everything has changed\r\nYou think you're not to blame\n\nHow come you keep on talking\n\nWhen the whole thing feels so strange?....\n\n\n\nBut seeing\n\nIs not the same as believing\n\nWhen everything goes wrong\n\nYou're anything but strong\n\n\n\nIt's all bittersweet\n\nOutside in the street\n\nThe grass is growing greener\n\nUnderneath your feet\n\nWe come and go\n\nThe deep water flows\n\nTiny leaves from smaller seeds\n\nTo tall trees do grow\n\n\n\nBut wanting\n\nIs not the same thing as needing\n\nThere's no need to pretend\n\nYou can't turn back again\n\nAnd loving\n\nIs so different to keeping\n\nThe hurting that we send\n\nIs so difficult to mend\n\n\n\n[Hold on to the good things]\n\n[That keep you from falling down]\n\n[Hold on to the good things]\n\n[That keep you from falling down]\n\n\n\nHow my heart aches\n\nMore than I can take\n\nWhat are we really learning\n\nWhen we make the same mistakes?\n\n\n\nWhere is your hope?\n\nIt's all gone up in smoke\n\nYou used to be so funny\n\nNow it's just the same old joke\n\n\n\nAnd laughing\n\nIs so very close to crying\n\nWhen there's nothing to defend\n\nIt gets you in the end\n\nAnd living\n\nIs so very close to dying\n\nYou struggle on and on\n\nTo find where you belong\n\n\n\nWhere do you belong?",
