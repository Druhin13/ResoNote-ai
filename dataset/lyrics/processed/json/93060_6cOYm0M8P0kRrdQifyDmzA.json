  "lyrics": "It was all about you and your homies, that's what it was about with me, me and my homies. Making sure everybody eat, making sure everybody's involved, but as you grow, you lose certain homies, because it's called, “closing the gap.” This is the gap, when we start. This is the gap when we start, this is the gap as you grow. This is the gap as you grow. Notice how you grow and they don't. So how do you close the gap? You gotta come back down, when you come back down you lose, so you gotta keep going up. That's why closing the gap gotta be them catching up to you, and if they don't catch up you gotta leave them behind.\r\nLook\r\nUsed to feel like an outcast, 'til I met hundred three stacks\r\nI put the North on my back\r\nMom got a wall full of plaques, I know she smiling at that\n\nI know you smiling down too, RIP Jeff 'til I'm through\n\nRIP all of my niggas, I'm tryna balance my life\n\nRunning through all of these bitches, which one gon' end up my wife?\n\nWhich one gon' pull out that knife, when she see my call log?\n\nBut I deny 'til I die, you know I'm a dog, oh\n\nBitch, I'm like fuck all y'all\n\nAs long as my family straight\n\nZante acting up but I just pray that nigga concentrate (Zante)\n\nPray that nigga find his way (Yeah), I know what you goin' through (I know)\n\nI feel what you feel but ayy just know you gotta stay strong, fool (Gotta stay strong)\n\nI won't let 'em harm you (Yeah), I been through that storm too (Ah)\n\nTrapped inside that darkness, once I prayed that light just shined through\n\nKeep the past behind you, worry about the now\n\nHad to let you know 'cause mom dukes worried about you now\n\nMe and my dad, we still ain't talking and that shit just blow my mind (Mind)\n\nI guess the price of fame will change your family, every time\n\nI'm like, man who can I trust 'cause shit done changed up when I signed (Changed)\n\nOr maybe it's just me, I left that bullshit behind\n\nI been focused on that money, I been focused on that paper\n\nNew crib in L.A and that bitch came with elevators (Yeah)\n\nDon't know why I'm stressing, I know I'm in God's favor (Preach)\n\nBut always keep that strap and watch out for them perpetrators\n\n\n\nTold y'all I came to ball, yay\n\nWaiting for my call, yay\n\nWhen you come from nothing it's a must you want it all, yay\n\nThey want me to fall, yay\n\nBut I'm standing tall, yay\n\nEx's keep on calling, I ignore them bitches all day\n\n\n\nIgnore them bitches all day (Whoo), ain't got time to backtrack (Back)\n\nI came from a place where students keep that in they backpack (Yup)\n\nWatch out for them rat traps, watch out for them dirty hoes\n\nFuckin' for a come up, even sneaking through your dirty clothes\n\nI know I'm the chosen one (Yeah), I know that I'm God's gift\n\nI know when I walk inside in a building, y'all gon' catch my drift\n\nI done lost relationships with niggas I thought was real\n\nMoney bring you problems, now I really know how big it feel (Whoo)\n\nOops my bad, how big it felt\n\nAh man, I can't help myself\n\nI just walked in Fifth's and grabbed a bag, and a Gucci belt\n\nNigga I deserve this shit, man I had to curve that bitch\n\nAin't talking 'bout shit, you just getting on my nerves and shit\n\nSpeak it in existence, I been on that for a while\n\nI pray I get along with the mother of my child (Pray)\n\nWhenever that they come, I promise we'll be straight (What?)\n\nMansions off this intro, you know Young K way too great\n\nLook, I ain't need no cosign, I built my own shit\n\nMade my own name and I brought my own clique\n\nLil' niggas too lame and they jump from dick to dick (Lame)\n\nNeed a hundred mil' and your blessings, and that's it\n\n\n\nNow for real.
