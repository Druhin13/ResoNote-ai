  "lyrics": "Oh to be alive\r\nIt's a struggle to survive\r\nFrom the dark of night\r\nWill I reach and feel the light\r\nWill I choose my fate\n\nIn the twinkle of an eye\n\nFrom the firmament\n\nYour ideal will come to life\n\n\n\nRumours grow from nothing\n\nLike a whisper in the crowd\n\nStars they will collide\n\nLovers will abide\n\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nWe could be the very best\n\nPut me to the test\n\nThink about it baby\n\n\n\nSuch a lonely voice\n\nGotta cry for Judgement Day\n\nA dream realised\n\nGot to pray to make it heard\n\n\n\nRumours grow from nothing\n\nLike a whisper in the crowd\n\nStars they will collide\n\nLovers will abide\n\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nWe could be the very best\n\nPut me to the test\n\nThink about it baby\n\n\n\nTowers come crumbling down\n\nStrike of lightning\n\nBuild it back up again\n\nCircle of life slowly turns\n\n\n\nRumours grow from nothing\n\nLike a whisper in the crowd\n\nStars they will collide\n\nLovers will abide\n\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nWe could be the very best\n\nPut me to the test\n\nThink about it baby\n\n\n\nRumours grow from nothing\n\nLike a whisper in the crowd\n\nStars they will collide\n\nLovers will abide\n\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nWe could be the very best\n\nPut me to the test\n\nThink about it baby",
