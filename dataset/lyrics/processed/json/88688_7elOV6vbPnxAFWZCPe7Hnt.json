  "lyrics": "Lemme show you just how far I can go\r\nI been running away\r\nThe only road I know\r\nMisery ave, yeah listen to that\r\nThat’s the sound of all the tears they’re leaking out of my bag\r\nI been back in the ville, the ville of nothing to feel\n\nUsed to be my Solace now it’s always sucking the will\n\nRight up out of my chest\n\nI’m down and out that’s at best\n\nI’m drowning out with no vest\n\nDon’t mean to make you upset\n\nDon’t mean to make you upset\n\n\n\nI don't know what else I can say\n\nI guess I'll sit and waste away\n\nI've been knocked down a million times\n\nI'll see how strong I am tonight\n\nI don't know what else I can do but pour my heart right out to you\n\nI hope that someone just like me will come along and set me free\n\n\n\nLaying in the bed like who's the stranger I've turned into\n\nI write it to remind me it's okay to have some issues\n\nMentally\n\nThat's the topic that I got some history\n\nI'm scared of what they'll think\n\nI'll keep it in, still got my dignity\n\nInternally I'm empty, I know you can't really tell it\n\nIf I wanna do the things I wanna do that makes me selfish\n\nBut these people need to understand my health comes first\n\nHeaven seems so out of reach, cause it's been hell on earth\n\nGot some demons ridin' with me as I write this verse\n\nI could crash into the wall, or I could fight this curse\n\nI know it's a losing battle, you can't tell me shit\n\nYou don't know what's best for me, unless you've been through it\n\nDamn\n\n\n\nI don't know what else I can say\n\nI guess I'll sit and waste away\n\nI've been knocked down a million times\n\nI'll see how strong I am tonight\n\n\n\nI don't know what else I can say\n\nI guess I'll sit and waste away\n\nI've been knocked down a million times\n\nI'll see how strong I am tonight\n\nI don't know what else I can do but pour my heart right out to you\n\nI hope that someone just like me will come along and set me free",
