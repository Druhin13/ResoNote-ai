  "lyrics": "Gotta get myself to Mexico\r\nFind a place on a beach where no one goes\r\nPut my head in the sand and stay awhile\r\nGotta figure out a couple things\r\nBuild a runway and a set of wings\n\nGonna fill my days and learn to fly\n\n\n\nI don't want to\n\nI don't want you to leave\n\nBut I can't fight this\n\nCan't rewrite this\n\n\n\nTell me how to let you go\n\nTell me how to let you go\n\nIt's like your love is nothing that I felt before, love\n\nTell me how to let you go\n\n\n\nIf you see me smile, it's all pretend\n\nThe only reason I still call our friends\n\nIs the chance one of them will say your name\n\n\n\nYeah, our stories over, pages turn\n\nYou were the sun in the sky and then you weren't\n\nAnd nothing left here works for me the same\n\n\n\nI've been dying\n\nTaken out at the knees\n\nWalk me thru this\n\nHow'd you do it?\n\n\n\nTell me how to let you go\n\nTell me how to let you go\n\nIt's like your love only makes me want you more love\n\nSo, tell me how to let you go\n\n\n\nYou get what you want but it's not what you needed\n\nYou get what you need but it's not what you're feeling\n\n\n\nTell me how to let you go\n\n\n\nYou get what you want but it's not what you needed\n\nYou get what you need but it's not what you're feeling\n\n\n\nTell me how to let you go",
