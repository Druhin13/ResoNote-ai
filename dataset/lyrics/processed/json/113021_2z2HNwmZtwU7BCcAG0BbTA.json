  "lyrics": "Squawk, seven-five\r\nZero zero mane\r\nWorld in a barrel dripping some blood\r\nThree dead riders\r\nGrippin' the reigns of saturn\n\nIn da last plastic cup\n\n\n\nCouldn't make me into a hero\n\nCouldn't turn me into a coward\n\nWhatever history that you wrote\n\nBlew away in the wind on your way down from your ivory tower\n\nYour words lost their power\n\nYou can aim down fire\n\nWe'll be down here living how we want\n\n\n\nNever coming back, never coming back\n\nRun into a smack with a hand to deliver\n\nNever coming back, never coming back\n\nRun into a smack with a hand to deliver\n\n\n\nYou always see right through me\n\nWhen I am lost and out of place\n\nYou always watch me stumble down\n\nWhile you wait for me to drown\n\n\n\nOf all the ways I've given in\n\nI can't believe it's not enough\n\nTo satisfy my endless search for any form of love\n\n\n\nSo I will stay my course until you break my wrists\n\nDo everything you can to keep me silent\n\nYou wanna start a war with all that I stand for\n\n\n\nYou always see right through my\n\nMy masquerade\n\nI know there's nowhere to hide\n\nI'm cellophane\n\n\n\nI feel like I'm gonna stay\n\nI feel like I'm gonna change\n\nI feel like I'm gonna stay\n\n\n\nNever coming back, never coming back\n\nRun into a smack with a hand to deliver\n\nNever coming back, never coming back\n\nRun into a smack with a hand to deliver\n\n\n\nYou always see right through me\n\nWhen I am lost and out of place\n\nYou always watch me stumble down\n\nWhile you wait for me to drown\n\n\n\nYou always see right through my\n\nMy masquerade\n\nI know there's nowhere to hide\n\nI'm cellophane\n\n\n\nAll of the handsome fiction\n\nWill melt away\n\nAnd when the flame burns brighter\n\nEvaporate\n\n\n\nYou always see right through my\n\nMy masquerade\n\nI know there's nowhere to hide\n\nI'm cellophane\n\n\n\nAll of the fabrications\n\nWill melt away\n\nAnd when the flame burns hotter\n\nEvaporate\n\n\n\n(Step back, let go, I believe there's meaning, no I believe there's nothing)\n\n(Step back, let go, I believe there's meaning, no I believe there's nothing)\n\nOh, you should have listened to your friends\n\nYou would have been over this by now\n\nOver this by now, I'm found\n\n(Who drains the blood from my head? I do do\n\nWho accepts me as I am? I do I do)\n\n\n\n(Repeat repeat, our history)\n\n(Repeat repeat, our history)\n\nWhat excuses do you make?\n\nWe own the night\n\nFor one good note\n\n\n\nWell don't it feel good?\n\nYou got what you paid for\n\nWell don't it feel good?\n\nYou got what you paid for",
