  "lyrics": "Smile an everlasting smile\rA smile can bring you near to me\rDon't ever let me find you gone\r'Cause that could bring a tear to me\rThis words have lost their glory,\rLet's start a brand new story, now my love\rRight now there'll be no other time\rAnd I can show you all my love\rTalk in everlasting words\rAnd dedicate them all to me\rI will give you all my life\rIt's here if you should call to me\rYou think that I don't even mean A single word I say\rIt's only words and words are all I have To steal your heart away",
