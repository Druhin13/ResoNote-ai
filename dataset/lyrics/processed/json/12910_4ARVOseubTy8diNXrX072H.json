  "lyrics": "What kinda' man lays \nhis hands on the woman he loves \ncalls her \"Angel\"\r\nand shows no remorse,\r\nand the blood,\r\nhe covers her body in bruises and scars\n\nyou don't understand just how beautiful \n\nyou are\n\n\n\nyou are too beautiful\n\nyour heart, I want something more\n\nThose shades of blue \n\non that face of yours\n\nHide the smile that beats in your chest\n\n\n\nwhen he's done with her beating\n\nHe just stands a side\n\nWipes the sweat from his brow\n\nand yells over her cries\n\n\"You don't know what I've been through!\"\n\nhe yells and says\n\n\"You don't know what I've done for you\"\n\nand hits her again.\n\n\n\nyou are too beautiful\n\nyour heart, I want something more\n\nThose shades of blue \n\non that face of yours\n\nHide the smile that beats in your chest\n\n\n\nShe stands in the mirror,\n\nShe looks less alive.\n\nShe lifts up her shirt \n\nto see she has five\n\nBranded fingers on her side.\n\nShe's feeling it all now\n\nBut she doesn't cry\n\nShe doesn't cry\n\n\n\nyou are too beautiful\n\nyour heart, I want something more\n\nThose shades of blue \n\non that face of yours\n\nHide the smile that beats in your chest\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Taylor for these lyrics and to animecharrie and demilia for these corrections)",
