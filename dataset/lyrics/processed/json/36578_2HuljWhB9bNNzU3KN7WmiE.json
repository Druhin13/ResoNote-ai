  "lyrics": "Heros and heroines are scarcer than they've ever been\r\nSo much more to lose than win the distance never greater\r\nWay back when you made history by flying planes across the sea\r\nEmbarking on your odyssey \nYou put away the danger\r\nHeaven bless the one who flys \n\nA pioneer on frontier skies\n\nThe world was dark and your only mark\n\nWas the light of the northern star\n\nI imagine what was in your eyes \n\nThe seeds of rust and days gone by\n\nYour wings hang in a gallery sky I wonder how you're flying\n\n\n\nWay out on the western plains\n\nThe snow drifts high and the dust wind burns\n\nThe chinooks blow their winds \n\nAcross the mountains\n\nA life that's never safe and dry rodeos and riding high\n\nLadies and their men get by on six guns and white lightening.\n\nHeaven bless them on the road those drifters and their dreams of gold\n\nThe world was wide and a cowboy's song could span the whole horizon\n\nI imagine what was in your eyes\n\nThe dust and the dirt under out law skies\n\nA piece of land and a stubborn mind were the only things worth having\n\n\n\nNow they say the moon is dust and ash and California's made of cash\n\nWe're waiting for those hills to crash into sparkling waters\n\nRain and snow and sun and wind\n\nYou roamed the earth and you spread your wings\n\nLong ago my hero's dreams belonged to all God's creatures\n\nHeaven bless the ones who sleep \n\nThe ones who laugh and the ones who weep\n\nHeaven bless the one who keep their bearings strong and certain\n\nAnd Lord help the fool who said \n\nYou'd better quit while you're ahead\n\nA dreamer born is a hero bred on earth and up in heaven\n\nAnd Lord help the fool who said \n\nYou'd better quit while you're ahead\n\nA dreamer born is a hero bred on earth and up in heaven",
