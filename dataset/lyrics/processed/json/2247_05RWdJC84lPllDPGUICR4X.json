  "lyrics": "It's you and your world and I'm caught in the middle\r\nI caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little\r\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know\r\nAnd I know that I can't be your friend\r\nIt's my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle\n\nMy hands are tied, but not tied enough\n\nYou're the high that I can't give up\n\nOh lord, here we go\n\n\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\n\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nAt the bottom of a bottle\n\nYou're the poison in the wine\n\nAnd I know\n\nI can't change you and I\n\nI won't change\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\n\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\n\n\nLet's be lonely together\n\nA little less lonely together\n\n\n\nEyes wide shut and it feels like the first time\n\nBefore the rush to my blood was too much and we flatlined\n\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends\n\nNow I'm all messed up and it feels like the first time\n\n\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\n\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\nAt the bottom of a bottle\n\nYou're the poison in the wine\n\nAnd I know\n\nI can't change you, and I\n\nI won't change\n\nI might hate myself tomorrow\n\nBut I'm on my way tonight\n\n\n\nLet's be lonely together\n\nA little less lonely together\n\nLet's be lonely together\n\nA little less lonely together\n\n\n\nMy hands are tied, but not tied enough\n\nYou're the high that I can't give up\n\nOh lord, here we go",
