  "lyrics": "I flirt with Brancusi's gesture\r\nI'm a bird in space\r\nAs his ghost escorts me to a magic place\r\nI'm dressed all in colours, neither white nor black\r\nAsk the begged question, need I come back\n\nI'll look nice like a bird in paradise\n\nForever caught in mid-flight\n\nHow I long to be\n\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\n\nForever caught in mid-flight\n\nHow I long to be\n\nHow I long to be\n\n\n\nSing on Olympus Mons so all the world can see\n\nPerfection in my structure, I have all I need\n\nThere's not a single stain on my song tonight\n\nWhen time is endless and I'm always right\n\n\n\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\n\nForever caught in mid-flight\n\nHow I long to be\n\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\n\nForever caught in mid-flight\n\nHow I long to be\n\nHow I long to be\n\n\n\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\n\nForever caught in mid-flight\n\nHow I long to be\n\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\n\nForever caught in mid-flight\n\nHow I long to be\n\nHow I long to be\n\nHow I long to be",
