  "lyrics": "The spirit of the sovereign Lord is on me\r\nTo tell the good news to the poor\r\nTo bind up the broken heart in heartache\r\nTo open wide them prison doors\r\nI cannot keep quiet\n\nThe song inside my skin\n\nI feel it run like a river\n\nI feel it runnin like a second wind\n\n\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?\n\nCome on won't you dance\n\nLike a prisoner released?\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?\n\n\n\nA crown of beauty for your ashes\n\nShake with laughter instead of fear\n\nA coat of praise instead of darknesss\n\nA God of light gonna meet you here\n\n\n\nLift up your eyes now\n\nIt takes your shame\n\nRebuild the ruins\n\nResurrection is the Maker's name\n\n\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?\n\nCome on won't you dance\n\nLike a prisoner released?\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?\n\n\n\nHe takes your shame\n\n\n\nI cannot keep quiet\n\nThe song inside my skin\n\nI feel it run like a river\n\nI feel it runnin like a second wind\n\n\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?\n\nCome on won't you dance\n\nLike a prisoner released?\n\nCome on won't you run?\n\nCome on won't you run free?",
