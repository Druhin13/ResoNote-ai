  "lyrics": "Â© Bob McDill\r\nUniversal Polygram International Publishing Inc.\r\n\r\nI went to see my honeydew, she lived just down the way\r\nI got stuck and the truck froze up and I only got half way\n\nSittin' here on the muddy road, stuck here all alone\n\nThe rain won't stop it's a beatin' on the top and I should have stayed at home\n\n\n\nI wish I was in Nashville, guitar on my back\n\nMaybe someday I will ride in the back of a big Cadillac\n\n\n\nMust have been a half a day, before I got back home\n\nThe roads all mud the creeks gonna flood and I'm here all alone\n\nSure feels good a gettin' back to my old shack again\n\nBut I'm all soaked and the radios broke and the rain keeps pouring in.\n\n\n\nI wish I was in Nashville, guitar on my back\n\nMaybe someday I will ride in the back of a big Cadillac\n\n\n\nI wish I was in Nashville, guitar on my back\n\nMaybe someday I will ride in the back of a big Cadillac",
