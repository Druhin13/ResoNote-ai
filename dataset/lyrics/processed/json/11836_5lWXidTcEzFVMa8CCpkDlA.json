  "lyrics": "I can’t play piano all that well\r\nLike, I’m fine\r\nI can get away with it\r\nIf I’m acting like I’m drunk on stage\r\nAnd you’re shocked that I’m playing anything\r\nI’ll get away with it\n\nI’ll get away with it, ooh\n\n\n\nI can’t see you in another’s arms\n\nLike, it’s cool\n\nI just can’t imagine it\n\nWould you fall asleep to different shows\n\nThan the ones that we drift away with?\n\nI couldn’t dream of it\n\nI couldn’t dream of it\n\n\n\nTV stars don’t care about who you are\n\nTV stars don’t care about who you are\n\n\n\nIt’s like somebody traded out my skin\n\nFor something I could never feel good in\n\nAnd told me “suck it up, get used to it\n\nTo Breathe in, repeat it.”\n\n\n\nIt’s like somebody traded out my skin\n\nFor something I could never feel good in\n\nAnd told me, “suck it up, get used to it.”\n\nTo breathe and repeat it\n\nInstead of listening\n\n\n\nTV stars don’t care about who you are\n\nTV stars don’t care about who you are\n\nDon’t care about who\n\nDon’t care about who you are\n\n\n\nI can’t spend another night alone\n\n‘Cause the echoes are too distracting\n\nGetting high and diving into holes\n\n‘Til I can’t even dream of sleeping\n\nAnd getting away from it\n\nGetting away from it\n\nOoh",
