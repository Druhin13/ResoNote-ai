  "lyrics": "Interrogations got my mental racing\r\nI ain't tryna end up in Bellevue as no mental patient\r\nSee the plan was let's set a schedule, Tim from the other side had it\r\nTim was into the flashing, sold him sour and caskets\r\nIt's systematic, every Thursday night he would re-up\r\nNavy blue Infiniti tinted, rolling his weed up\n\nAnytime he felt he was followed it made him speed up\n\nHe rarely cracked a smile, his demeanor was always G'd up\n\nKnew this chick that was mutual, every Monday they'd meet up\n\nQuick visits, he'd drop off a bag, she got her feet up\n\nTim paid the rent to the apartment, it's in shorty's name\n\nShorty's name? I'll get to that later, to me they all the same\n\nMy cousin James called my phone, told me it's urgent\n\nHe scoped the situation out, timing had to be perfect\n\nWorthless feelings building inside the mother of Tim's kids\n\nHe got two boys plus she know where all of his friends live\n\nWe found the weakness in his platoon, it's goon weather\n\nHoodies only do dark colors, it help us move better\n\nI told James, cuz you know what to do if you catch her\n\nMight've took a loss, will I lose? never, that's fool's treasure\n\nWe gon' do this right, we ain't the type that's too extra\n\nIt's Sunday night, James got the drop on the meeting time\n\nMonday came, Tim switched cars, nothing police could find\n\nI'm on standby, James supposed to come pick me up\n\nHe said at three, at ten meeting shorty, something he picking up\n\nJames ain't got no kids or no wifey so he don't give a fuck\n\nJames remember when I had called him, glad that he picked it up\n\n(Hello?) I told him I woke up, Rollie missing (word?)\n\nShit had me sick cuz, ready to make my home the prison\n\nShe had her Gram deleted morning after I got robbed\n\nSince then I been looking for her, I treat it like a job\n\nJames took a picture and sent it, asked me who is it\n\nI text him and I told him, no question, she look familiar\n\nFifteen thousand, the Rollie and a couple chains\n\nCharged it to the game but something was on my brain\n\nCouldn't figure it out, I'm thinking like Tim lying\n\nJames peeped one of Tim's sons walking with mommy\n\nHe thinking put him in the trunk and then he lit a blunt\n\nHe getting antsy, he been sitting on this lick all month\n\nHe ain't bother them, more concerned with they father them\n\nJames parked in the complex, shawty walking in\n\nBlack leggings, leather jacket, and some black shades\n\nShorty five seven, few days earlier she got braids\n\nEver since I got robbed, riding 'round in a hot rage\n\nDon't even care if I get locked up 'til I'm my pops' age\n\nJames called me one more time, Tim pulled up by himself\n\nHe parked and walked in the building, and then he checked his mail\n\nJames a face Tim ain't never seen, shorty and Tim\n\nUp in the crib, this nigga fell asleep\n\nJames knocked twice, nobody answered so he picked the lock\n\nCut the lights, took his shoes off, walked around in his socks\n\nShorty in the bathroom, wine glass and red wine\n\nTim got missed calls from his sons before they bedtime\n\nJames opened the door, it's steaming, whole mirror foggy\n\nShorty in the tub, James 'bout to leap, he feeling froggy\n\nSoon as she see him, two shots, right in the forehead\n\nSilencer kept the blood neat, ain't leave the floor red\n\nSlid out, Tim still sleeping, he never woke up\n\nJames had some powder to make him think Tim was coked up\n\nLeather bag, iPhones, chains, and the Rolex\n\nFifteen thousand in hundreds and fifties, took no less\n\nTim stretched out so James looked through his phone\n\nSearched through all the dressers, exploring all through the home\n\nA couple of text messages, saw the name Keish\n\nWait a minute, that's that same bitch that robbed East\n\nJames ran out, jumped in the car, relit the blunt up\n\nThe sun up, kids going to school, think I might come up\n\nKeisha found in a pool of blood, James got one up\n\nI owe you nigga",
