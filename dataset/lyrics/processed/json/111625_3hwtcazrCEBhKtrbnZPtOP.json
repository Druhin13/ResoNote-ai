  "lyrics": "Have you ever felt it could all go away if you blink\r\nIf you never stop running you won't fall behind, so you think\r\nAnd you wonder in your heart if you're still not who you are, who are you?\r\nNothing's as it seems till it all falls apart\r\nIf you have a dream go chase it\n\nIf you feel hope don't waste it\n\nIf you find love embrace it\n\nAnd never take a single breath for granted\n\nThe story's yours, go write it\n\nTomorrow's undecided\n\nOur days are counted on this planet\n\nNever take a single breath\n\nTake a single breath for granted\n\n\n\nMaybe it's time you bet on yourself\n\nListen to your heart, just listen to your heart and nobody else\n\nSo go find out who you are, only you know who you are, who are you?\n\n'Cause all you have to lose is your best life yet, so go ahead\n\n\n\nIf you have a dream go chase it\n\nIf you feel hope don't waste it\n\nIf you find love embrace it\n\nAnd never take a single breath for granted\n\nThe story's yours, go write it\n\nTomorrow's undecided\n\nOur days are counted on this planet\n\nNever take a single breath\n\nTake a single breath for granted\n\n\n\nSometimes the greatest moment we'll ever know\n\nAre when we're letting go, so let go\n\nAnd maybe our brightest days still wait for us\n\nIn the unknown\n\n\n\nIf you have a dream go chase it\n\nIf you feel hope don't waste it\n\nIf you find love embrace it\n\nNever take a single breath for granted\n\nIf you have a light go find it\n\nThe story's yours, go write it\n\nOur days are counted on this planet\n\nSo I won't take a single breath\n\nTake a single breath for granted",
