  "lyrics": "I've played every honky tonk and roadside bar and juke joint\r\nBetween here and Minneapolis\r\nYou know I've lived these miles\r\nThere's a haggard man behind these eyes and smile\r\nI picked up the guitar 'round the time I turned fourteen\n\nLit that fire, been burnin' tires, hard booze, both ends and gasoline\n\nStayin' wired\n\nCome back down the best that we know how\n\nWe know now\n\n\n\nWe're all tryin' to quit smokin'\n\nTired of laughin', tired of jokin'\n\n'Bout the habits we all have slowly creepin' up\n\nWe all gotta die from somethin'\n\nLivin' kills you, life is tough\n\nBut I can't quit 'cause I can't quit enough\n\n\n\nI've felt all the pressures playin' to an empty room\n\nAnd the pleasures of a crowd that's singin' loud to every word to all my songs\n\nBut the band and me, Lord, keep rollin' on\n\nWe roll on\n\n\n\nWe're still tryin' to quit smokin'\n\nTired of laughin', tired of jokin'\n\n'Bout the habits we all have slowly creepin' up\n\nWe all gotta die from somethin'\n\nLivin' kills you, life is tough\n\nI can't quit 'cause I can't quit enough\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're all tryin' to quit smokin'\n\nTired of laughin', tired of jokin'\n\n'Bout the habits we all have slowly creepin' up\n\nWe all gotta die from somethin'\n\nLivin' kills you, life is tough\n\nI can't quit 'cause I can't quit enough\n\nI'll never quit 'cause I can't quit enough",
