  "lyrics": "Early in the morning, up and fly away\r\nYou know why you don't walk here round the sun, no, my face\r\nCouldn't get back to celebrate\r\nAnd I know you're backing off, you want it both ways\r\nAt night, I'm trading, gold diamonds for stars\n\nBlinded by fire, showing me who you are\n\nFuck it, fade away, child 'til another day, child\n\nGotta keep my state of mind\n\n\n\nMaybe I have to wait a while\n\nMaybe I have to wait a while\n\nMaybe I could change your mind\n\nMaybe I could change your mind, woah, oh\n\n\n\nStep into the backroom, take your breath away\n\nEven though it's been some time, you still love my taste\n\nTrying to meet your eyes, I keep my sanity\n\nThough I know you're backing off, you want it both ways\n\n\n\nAt night, I'm trading, gold diamonds for stars\n\nBlinded by fire, showing me who you are\n\nFuck it, fade away, child 'til another day, child\n\nGotta keep my state of mind\n\n\n\nMaybe I have to wait a while\n\nMaybe I have to wait a while\n\nMaybe I could change your mind\n\nMaybe I could change your mind, woah, oh\n\n\n\nI could feel the waves from you and I\n\nSlamming on shore on the other side\n\nBut I have to wait 'til it's time\n\nFly away, fly away\n\nI could feel the waves from you and I\n\nSlamming on shore on the other side\n\nBut I have to wait 'til it's time\n\nFly away, fly away\n\nI could feel the waves from you and I\n\nSlamming on shore on the other side\n\nBut I have to wait 'til it's time\n\nFly away, fly away\n\nOh, I could feel the waves from you and I\n\nSlamming on shore on the other side\n\nBut I have to wait 'til it's time, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nFly away, fly away",
