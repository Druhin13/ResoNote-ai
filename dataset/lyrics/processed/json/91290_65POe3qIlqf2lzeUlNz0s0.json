(I don't know)\r\nTo make it out this time (Goddamn)\n\n\n\nI got lipstick on my collar, got her kisses on my neck\n\nGot her fragrance all up on me, damn, I bet I smell like sex\n\nGot her texts in my phone, damn, why can't I delete?\n\nI mean 'cause even if I do that doesn't mean that I ain't cheat, oh no\n\n\n\nI can't make it right 'cause I know I'm wrong\n\nYou deserve better than me (Much better than me)\n\nSomeone who gon' do what he say (Oh)\n\nSomebody who says what they mean\n\nI been lies true for way too long\n\nI'm even tired of me\n\nGirl, I've come face-to-face with my\n\n\n\nInfidelity\n\nLord know I'm tryin', I'm always lyin'\n\nIt's like they come right out of me\n\nMeanwhile, you're slowly dyin'\n\nI'm starin' face-to-face with my\n\nInfidelity\n\nI know it\n\nInfidelity\n\nI know it, yeah\n\n\n\nYou should've up and packed by now\n\nI know you're tired of waiting, pacing by your phone\n\nLike, \"Is he gon' check in?
