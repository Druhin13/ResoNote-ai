I wonder why\r\nCause I do, yeah I do, like a million times\r\nTurn me on, let it go\n\nMade me feel like you're on my side\n\nHung it up, said goodbye\n\nLiving sad songs that I couldn't write\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop missing you\n\nSo bad\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye\n\nAnd all I needed was you\n\nSo bad\n\nTell me how to turn back time\n\nIf the feeling's not forever\n\nYou and I can stop\n\nHeaven knows I'll do it again\n\nAnd I can't stop missing you\n\nSo bad\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye\n\n\n\nI would have said it\n\nI should have tried\n\nI should have stopped when I realized\n\nDo I even care? I couldn't cry\n\nBut you do, yeah you do like a million times\n\n\n\nTurn me on, let it go\n\nMade me feel like you're on my side\n\nHung it up, said goodbye\n\nLiving sad songs that I couldn't write\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop missing you\n\nSo bad\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye\n\nAnd all I needed was you\n\nSo bad\n\nTell me how to turn back time\n\nIf the feeling's not forever\n\nYou and I can stop\n\nHeaven knows I'll do it again\n\nAnd I can't stop missing you\n\nSo bad\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye\n\n\n\n(Turn me on.)\n\n(Turn me on.)\n\n(Turn me on.)\n\nI've never had to be without you\n\n(Turn me on.)\n\nI've never had to be without you\n\n(Turn me on.)\n\nI've never had to be without you\n\n(Turn me on.)\n\nI've never had to be without you\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop missing you\n\nSo bad\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye\n\nAnd all I needed was you\n\nSo bad\n\nTell me how to turn back time\n\nIf the feeling's not forever\n\nYou and I can stop\n\nHeaven knows I'll do it again\n\nAnd I can't stop missing you\n\nSo bad\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye",
