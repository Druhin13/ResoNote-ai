  "lyrics": "Longfellow Serenade\r\nSuch were the plans I'd made\r\nFor she was a lady\r\nAnd I was a dreamer\r\nWith only words to trade\n\nYou know that I was born\n\nFor a night like this\n\nWarmed by a stolen kiss\n\nFor I was lonely\n\nAnd she was lonely\n\n\n\nRide, come on baby, ride\n\nLet me make your dreams come true\n\nI'll sing my song\n\nLet me sing my song\n\nLet me make it warm for you\n\n\n\nI'll weave his web of rhyme\n\nUpon the summer night\n\nWe'll leave this worldly time\n\nOn his winged flight\n\nThen come, and as we lay\n\nBeside this sleepy glade\n\nThere I will sing to you\n\nMy Longfellow serenade\n\n\n\nLongfellow serenade\n\nSuch were the plans I made\n\nBut she was a lady\n\nAs deep as the river\n\nAnd through the night we stayed\n\nAnd in my way I loved her as none before\n\nLoved her with words and more\n\nFor she was lonely and I was lonely\n\n\n\nRide, come on baby, ride\n\nLet me make your dreams come true\n\nI'll sing my song\n\nLet me sing my song\n\nLet me make it warm for you\n\n\n\nI'll weave his web of rhyme\n\nUpon the summer night\n\nWe'll leave this worldly time\n\nOn his winged flight\n\nThen come, and as we lay\n\nBeside this sleepy glade\n\nThere I will sing to you\n\nMy Longfellow serenade\n\n\n\nWeave your web of rhyme\n\nUpon the summer night\n\nWe'll leave this worldly time\n\nOn your winged flight",
