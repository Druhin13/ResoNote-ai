  "lyrics": "No single grain of sound\r\nNo texture anywhere\r\nI'm close to dreaming\r\nCaught inbetween two hollowed worlds\r\nBreath in\n\nThe dust in winds\n\nThe fear within\n\nOnly memories remain\n\nLooking for new ways\n\n\n\nI am closer to percieve\n\nI am caught between these worlds\n\nNo excuses from the past\n\nBut maybe it just replies\n\n\n\nShadows from the past",
