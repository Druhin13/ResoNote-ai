  "lyrics": "You always said living with me was impossible\r\nTry it I said just like the wind I'm changeable\r\nWe ain't got money but we sure got laughs \nlots of loving too\r\nSo I confess on my behalf\r\nyou're giving me honestly\n\nthe best days of my life\n\n\n\nYour whispering girls said don't be a fool\n\ndon't give into him \n\nHe's an animal treat you like dirt \n\nthen he'll turn you in\n\nYou two are not compatible\n\nIt'll never never last \n\nThey said I wasn't even suitable\n\nBut you're giving me honestly \n\nthe best days of my life\n\n\n\nSometimes I wonder \n\nwhy does she bother with me at all\n\nSo staid in my ways \n\nLet's face it my dear, I'm insufferable\n\n\n\nThe crazy nights spilling into days\n\nwith all my noisy friends\n\nBut they all love you as much as I\n\nGiving me constantly\n\nthe best days of my life\n\nAnd a day without you at this point my dear\n\nseems unthinkable\n\nA night without you more often\n\nthan not is unbearable\n\n\n\nBut if it all can't work out\n\none can never never tell\n\nIn my heart there is no doubt\n\nyou gave to me unselfishly\n\nthe best days of my life\n\n\n\nBut if it all can't work out one can never never tell",
