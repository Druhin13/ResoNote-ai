  "lyrics": "I took out my pen and pad and set to write my manifesto\r\nIt was a one line poem said don't let nothing ever get you low\r\nThere's a hole open to heaven and I looked straight through\r\nWe were love drunk, giving like we was living on the bayou\r\nWho made these fucking rule and said that I was born to live by\n\nGive em hell til I die, don't bury me in no suit and tie\n\nCause I don't wanna work for another man's money\n\nYes sir, no sir, give it to me honey\n\n\n\nI had a revelation I was told a lie\n\nLive to consume, work to buy then die\n\nBut truth enters the mind one little word at a time\n\nAnd you can't shake the smell of the cat on the line\n\n\n\nWho made these fucking rule and said that I was born to live by\n\nGive em hell til I die, don't bury me in no suit and tie\n\nCause I don't wanna work for another man's money\n\nYes sir, no sir, give it to me honey\n\n\n\nWho made these fucking rule and said that I was born to live by\n\nWho made these fucking rule and said that I was born to live by\n\nWho made these fucking rule and said that I was born to live by\n\nWho made these fucking rule and said that I was born to live by\n\n\n\nTell me I'm alive, show me I am human\n\nI wanna log off, shut down and leave the room",
