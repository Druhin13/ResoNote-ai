  "lyrics": "The mighty ship lies broken on the rocks\r\nThe crew lay dead their bodies rot\r\nA wooden coffin washed up on the shore\r\nThey drag it to the abbey steps\r\nBuried there and laid to rest\r\nBut soon the evil curse will rise again\n\nBring the cross and holy water\n\nPray to God to stop the slaughter\n\nNosferatu creature of the night\n\nNosferatu darkness kills the light\n\n\n\nUnderneath a blood red moon\n\nDarkness calls the night comes soon\n\nHe rises from the grave to kill again\n\nBar the gates and windows shut\n\nTurn away don't even look\n\nThe Devils seed is hunting for the prey\n\nTake the vow before the alter\n\nTrust in God to stop the slaughter\n\n\n\nNosferatu creature of the night\n\nNosferatu darkness kills the light\n\nBeneath the abbey vaults we dance the vampire's waltz\n\n\n\nLonely streets the village sleeps\n\nIn the darkness evil creeps\n\nThe smell of death lies heavy on the air\n\nA lonely soul just walking home\n\nShe has the sense she's not alone\n\nWith a deadly stare she falls beneath his will\n\nBring the cross and holy water\n\nPray to God to end the slaughter\n\n\n\nNosferatu creature of the night\n\nNosferatu darkness kills the light",
