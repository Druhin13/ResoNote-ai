  "lyrics": "I need sleep\r\nLonging for silence and solitude\r\nWon't you bring me an eternal dream\r\nOf static frequencies?\r\nNo more loneliness beyond my last breath\r\nClose my eyes\r\nAnd let me fucking rest\r\nWatch me sink deep beneath your feet\r\nTell me where, where will my soul take me?\r\nUnconscious thought treads the speed of light\r\nSpiraling and absorbing me\r\nA piece of absolution\r\nRealization and confirmation\r\n\"Everything is gonna be fine\"\r\nI once imagined that I could fly\r\nBut the fear of falling killed my will\r\nDissolving my drive\r\nI like to believe that my will is strong\r\nBut when your bones are breaking\r\nYour hands are shaking\r\nHow does one carry on?\r\nThese thoughts won't go away\r\nUntil I understand my pain\r\nFuck\r\nJust like the old days\r\nWhen we were young\r\nWhen a smile came naturally\r\nMy inspiration to carry on\r\nWhen I'm tired and crumbling\r\nGet me out of this place\r\nThat I decided I'd create and call reality\r\nTake me somewhere where sovereignty\r\nIsn't leaving me restless\r\nLeaving me restless\r\nRest\r\nI don't want to die\r\nBut sometimes I hate the feeling of being alive\r\nCrawls on my skull, but under my skin\r\nScreams in my ear\r\n\"You'll never win, never win\"\r\nNever fucking win\r\nI feel sick, weak and alone\r\nSo I'm counting down the fucking days\r\nCounting my fucking life away\r\nI can't stand the fucking monotony\r\nThis circle is merciless\r\nThis instant is endless\r\nAnd I know I'm not the only one who feels like this\r\nI'll take my heart and pride and find a way to escape\r\nThis fragile mind and let it go\r\nLet it go\r\nGet me out of this place\r\nThat I decided I'd create and call reality\r\nTake me somewhere where sovereignty\r\nIsn't leaving me restless\r\nLeaving me restless\r\nGet me out of this place (Just like the old days when we were young)\r\nThat I decided I'd create\r\nAnd call reality (when a smile came naturally)\r\nTake me somewhere\r\nWhere sovereignty (my inspiration to carry on)\r\nIsn't leaving me restless\r\nLeaving me restless (when I'm tired and crumbling)",
