  "lyrics": "Boo what you tryna prove?\r\nCan we just talk about it?\r\nGot nothin' left to lose\r\nBut you still walk around it\r\nAnd I'm the one who chooses\r\nTo still wonder 'bout you\n\nI think I know the truth\n\nBut sometimes I doubt it\n\n\n\nAnd I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down\n\nCause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now\n\n\n\nBut you don't know it\n\nYou don't know it\n\nYou don't know it\n\nYou don't even know it!\n\n\n\nI try to keep my cool, but it's too hard to tell if\n\nYou play me for a fool or your heart finally felt it\n\nAnd you're the one who's losin', you're too fuckin' selfish\n\nI didn't wanna do this, but I just can't help it\n\n\n\nAnd I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down\n\nCause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now\n\n\n\nBut you don't know it\n\nYou don't know it\n\nYou don't know it\n\nYou don't know it\n\nYou don't even know it\n\n\n\nIf you wanna leave, my girl, you better leave\n\nI really got a lot to offer, please\n\nShe said she stay, I begged her mother, please\n\nI got your message, baby, don't repeat\n\nI know your body more [?]\n\nYou [?] baby don't believe\n\nCause all we have is never meant to be\n\nNo disrespect, but you set the tone\n\n\n\nAnd I'm afraid it'll hurt when I finally fall down\n\nSing for me, gyal\n\nCause the weight of my world's in the palm of your hands now\n\n\n\nBut you don't know it\n\nMe no know, me no know\n\nMy gyal, you like to know\n\nYou don't know it\n\nMe no know, me no know\n\nMy gyal, you need to know\n\nYou don't know it\n\nYou don't even know it\n\nMe no know, me no know\n\nMy gyal, you need to know\n\n\n\nInternational flexin'\n\nYou don't know it\n\n\n\nYou don't know it...",
