  "lyrics": "I found love with the chemicals\r\nI used to pray for a miracle, but now\r\nI know that it's all over\r\nI used to sit by the waterside\r\nI Kiss your cheek and say \"You're mine\"\r\nBut now I know it's over\n\n\n\nAnd all these little things, they start to slip away\n\nOoh\n\nAnd all these little things start to fade away\n\nAnd you said\n\n\n\n\"Hold me, I'm falling apart\"\n\n\"cos I'm scared and lost in the dark\"\n\n\"and this feeling surely can not last\"\n\nSo I took it away, took it away\n\nAway from you\n\nWhoaa whoaa laa\n\n\n\nI held your hand but you let it go\n\nI knew your heart had found a home\n\nNow I know it's over\n\nI flew it out into the sky\n\nTryna run from this mountain I couldn't climb\n\n'cause I knew I'd fall over\n\n\n\nAnd all these little things, they start to slip away\n\nOoh\n\nAnd all these little things start to fade away\n\nAnd you said\n\n\n\n\"Hold me, I'm falling apart\"\n\n\"and I'm scared and lost in the dark\"\n\n\"and this feeling surely can not last\"\n\nSo I took it away, I took it away\n\n\n\nAnd we were making plans and breaking dreams\n\nWhen you were next to me\n\nIt's 3 AM in the back of a cab\n\nAnd I am begging on my knees\n\n\"Don't go, won't you stay?\"\n\n\"I can't stand to watch you walk away from me\"\n\nAnd you said\n\n\n\n\"Hold me, I'm falling apart\"\n\n\"and I'm scared and lost in the dark\"\n\n\"and this feeling surely can not last\"\n\nSo I took it away, I took it away\n\nAway from you\n\nWhoaa whoaa laa ohh",
