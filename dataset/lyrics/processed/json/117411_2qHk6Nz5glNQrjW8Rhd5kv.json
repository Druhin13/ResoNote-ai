  "lyrics": "Thank God for the weekend\r\nI'ma go out with my friends, I'd rather let the liquor sink in\r\nThan the thoughts of you that I should not be thinking\r\nWhen I'm with someone else, it's feeling like I’m cheating\r\nI just might go off the deep end\r\nWhen I’ve had too much, can’t shut me up, now when you start to creep in\n\nKnow that everyone is sick of all my reasons, I-\n\nI let you come and go like seasons\n\n\n\nFirst I blame you, then I want you\n\nFucking hate you, then I love you\n\nI can't help myself, no\n\nWhen I have you, wanna leave you\n\nIf you go, that's when I need you\n\nI can't help myself, no\n\n\n\nYou come in waves, waves, waves\n\nEvery hour, every day, day, day\n\nYou come in waves, yeah\n\n\n\nI keep on going through the motions\n\nBut we ended long ago, I should be numb to these emotions\n\nBut you flood my memory just like an ocean, and\n\nAnd I was drowning in devotion\n\n\n\nFirst I blame you, then I want you\n\nFucking hate you, then I love you\n\nI can't help myself, no\n\nWhen I have you, wanna leave you\n\nIf you go, that's when I need you\n\nI can't help myself, no\n\n\n\nYou come in waves, waves, waves\n\nEvery hour every day, day, day\n\nYou come in waves, yeah (You come in waves)\n\n\n\n(Yeah)\n\nI come with ups and downs, yeah, I know\n\nIf you tryna ride, ride slow\n\nDeep breath for the tide\n\nHold tight for the stride, I can see it in your eyes\n\nI come with monsoons\n\nMade love on the full moon, yeah\n\nWave like water, not a trend\n\nIf we start it up then this'll be the end (Start it up)\n\nFirst I love you, then I hate you\n\nI won't dare try to replace you\n\nI ain't crazy, no (I ain't crazy, no)\n\nI'm ecstatic, then I'm sad\n\nOn a high then I crashed\n\n'Cause you made me so (Damn)\n\n\n\nYou come in waves, waves, waves (Yeah, oh, yeah)\n\nEvery hour, every day, day, day\n\nI hate so bad that you come in waves\n\nYou come in waves, waves, waves\n\nYou come in waves, you come in waves\n\nEvery hour, every day, day, day (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n\n\nYou do, you do, you come in waves\n\nYou come in waves, yeah, yeah, oh\n\nYou do, you do, you come in waves",
