  "lyrics": "Lost and awaiting my fate I wonder\r\nFar from your shelter, far from your love\r\nJust like a lark in the midnight hour\r\nThe song I'm singing is just a sigh\r\nWhen you're not here the flowers don't blossom\n\nWhen you're not here I'm lost on an ocean\n\nAnd the night is long and all is silent\n\nStaring at a star that never shines\n\n\n\nWhen you're not here nothing seems to matter\n\nAll hope is gone when you're not around\n\nHelplessly awaiting while my heart is breaking\n\nEverything's blue when you're not around\n\n\n\nWhen you are near me the dawn starts glowing\n\nBright as a morning beneath the sun\n\nYours is a love that could move a mountain\n\nAnd life is laughter when you're around\n\n\n\nBut when you're not here the flowers don't blossom\n\nWhen you're not here I'm lost on an ocean\n\nAnd the night is long and all is silent\n\nStaring at a star that never shines\n\n\n\nWhen you're not here nothing seems to matter\n\nAll hope is gone when you're not around\n\nHelplessly awaiting while my heart is breaking\n\nEverything's blue when you're not around",
