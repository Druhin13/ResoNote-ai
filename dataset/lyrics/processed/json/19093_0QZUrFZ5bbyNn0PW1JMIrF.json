  "lyrics": "There's a whisper in my chest\r\nIt's telling me\r\nThe best is yet to come\r\nHiding in the night\r\nShadows speak\r\nTelling me to run\n\n\n\nWe had our chance, but it's over now\n\nWe gave it all to the lost and found\n\n\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nWheels keep turning\n\nAnd I'm going under\n\nGoing under\n\nI've already packed my promises\n\nThey're waiting by the door\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\n\n\nTry to turn away\n\nGot tangled in the past\n\nIt's overgrown\n\nI look up to the sky\n\nTry to spread my wings\n\nBut that bird's already flown\n\nI'm reaching out for the higher ground\n\nBut we gave it all to the lost and found\n\n\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nWheels keep turning\n\nAnd I'm going under\n\nGoing under\n\nI've already packed my promises\n\nThey're waiting by the door\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\n\n\nWe are dreams of foolish gold\n\nLive recklessly with our hearts\n\nAnd with hands too hard to hold\n\nYou wrapped me into your arms\n\nYou wrapped me into your arms\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\n\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nRun for cover\n\nWheels keep turning\n\nAnd I'm going under\n\nGoing under\n\nI've already packed my promises\n\nThey're waiting by the door\n\nThe house is burning\n\nBetter run for cover\n\nRun for cover",
