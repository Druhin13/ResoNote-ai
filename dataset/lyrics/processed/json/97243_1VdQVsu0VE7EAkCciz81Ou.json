  "lyrics": "Why do I feel like killing myself with this love?\r\nWhy do I drown my sorrow inside of the clubs?\r\nWhy must I do these things to hurt just to feel alive?\r\nMaybe my icons are desperate, may be why\r\nI'm not afraid to tell God I'm a troubled soul\r\nTrouble is how I ride all this shit, so I guess he knows\n\nI made a living off of gravediggin'\n\nI'm a stone setter with no diamonds just one in the rough\n\nSo put two in my cup, I'm downtrodden, ridin'\n\n\n\nI can't see you again\n\nToo many drinks again\n\n(Over again, over again, over again, over again)\n\nToo many drinks again\n\n(Over again, over again, over again, over again)\n\nI can't see you again\n\n(Over again, over again, over again)\n\nToo many drinks\n\n\n\nScarred from what the knife brung, beauty cuts deep\n\nEspecially tonight, yeah, especially\n\nI walked the broken line 'til I reach a deep trench\n\nSwim across the risky river, no defense\n\nDark days, baby boy, no lights on\n\nI braved the alleyways, cold grip, python\n\nBraced myself for impact with the beer back\n\nA crooked reflection, even though the mirror's flat\n\nMolotov cocktail to my ether, hot flash\n\nNightmare, sweat stains in the sheets, yeah, it's a dream state\n\nHell's fire is a deep lake and the devil is a cheap date\n\nHe's a cheap date, cheap date, cheap date\n\n\n\nI can't see you again\n\nToo many drinks again\n\n(Over again, over again, over again, over again)\n\nToo many drinks again\n\n(Over again, over again, over again, over again)\n\nI can't see you again\n\n(Over again, over again, over again)\n\nToo many drinks\n\n\n\nDJ Klever, bitch\n\nUh\n\nLet's go",
