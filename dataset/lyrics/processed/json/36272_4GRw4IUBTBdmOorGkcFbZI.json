  "lyrics": "You stole my heart the moment you came to town\r\nI said hello but you were gone when I turned around\r\nYou can't get away, can't get away, even if you try now\r\nI wanna tell you but the words just can't be found\r\nI like the way you move and just the way you are\n\nI can't take anymore, 'cos girl, you're pushin' too hard\n\nYou can't get away, can't let you go, what's a boy to do now\n\nYou got me askin' myself how I survived this far\n\n\n\nI gotta get away from you, girl\n\n'Cos I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you\n\nNever thought a girl could make me feel the way you do\n\nNever been afraid of - never been afraid of love 'til I met you\n\nOoh, yes you say\n\n\n\nCan't be something that you never ever had\n\nWhen I start to think about you, it makes me laugh\n\nYou took me by surprise, I saw it in your eyes, I never had a chance, girl\n\nNow that I see what you are, it doesn't hurt so bad\n\n\n\nI gotta get away from you, girl\n\n'Cos I've never been afraid of love 'til I met you\n\nNever thought a girl could make me feel the way you do\n\nNever been afraid of - never been afraid of love 'til I met you\n\nOoh, yes you say",
