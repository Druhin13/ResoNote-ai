  "lyrics": "Call the folks, leave a note, lock the \nDoors and windows\r\nPack the truck, here's to luck\r\nHere's to how the wind blows\r\nNow lose the map and compass\r\nNow read the signs obey the lines\n\nFollow all your hunches\n\n'Cause now it's just the open road\n\nOne small heart and a great big soul that's driving\n\n\n\nRadio singing low just like a true companion\n\nL.A.'s lights wavy bright, they follow like a lantern\n\nThen morning comes and desert sun\n\nRises like redemption\n\nAnother day to make your way from answer\n\nBack to question\n\nOut here on the open road\n\nOne small heart and a great big soul that's driving\n\n\n\nNo set of directions, no shortcuts\n\nJust some empty soda cans,\n\nSome cigarette butts\n\nThe key to traveling light is to \n\nNot need very much\n\n\n\nLate tonight you'll see the lights of a\n\nThousand stars above you\n\nAnd at a roadside stop you'll\n\nCall to talk to a voice\n\nBack home that swears to love you\n\nBut at the sound of the tone you'll\n\nHang up the phone\n\nAnd peel out of that joint\n\nYou might try again God knows when;\n\nAt least they got the point\n\nThey lost you to the open road, one small heart\n\nAnd a great big soul \n\nThat's driving, driving\n\nOut here on the open road\n\nOne small heart and a great big soul that's driving",
