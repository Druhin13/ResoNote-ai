  "lyrics": "I've been hopelessly clutching up for something I can hold\r\nI've been lying in the dark with no light in my soul\r\nI've been rummaging around in the rain and the cold\r\nI've been searching for diamonds in a pile of coal\r\nI've been searching for diamonds in a pile of coal\n\nI've been reckless and ragged, I've been running to the ground\n\nI've been lost for so long I forgot I could be found\n\nI've been holding my breath for the axe to come down\n\nI've been searching for angels in the devil's town\n\nI've been searching for angels in the devil's town\n\n\n\nSearching for a heart to love\n\nIs like staring at the stars above\n\nAnd there's a million I can see\n\nBut only one that shines for me\n\nSo I keep searching for a heart to love\n\nOh, to love\n\n\n\nWell, I've been dancing blindly, I've been preaching to the choir\n\nI'm the boy who cried wolf but I dispute that I'm a liar\n\nAnd I left my frying pan to jump into the fire\n\nI've built my house on the sand and I'll keep on building it higher\n\nI've built my house on the sand and I'll keep on building it higher\n\n\n\nSearching for a heart to love\n\nIs like staring at the stars above\n\nYou can't teach your heart to feel\n\nWhat isn't there and isn't real\n\nSo I keep searching for a heart to love\n\n\n\nWell, I keep searching, I keep searching\n\nYeah, I keep searching, I keep searching love\n\nYeah, I keep searching for a heart to love\n\nLove\n\nLove\n\nLove",
