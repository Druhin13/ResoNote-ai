  "lyrics": "I’m young\r\nWhat can I know of the tide turn\r\nHow can I wish to descry\r\nAll shades of white, all types of gray?\r\nI’ve sung\n\nTo rebels, old men\n\nThe poor and rich\n\nAnd all I can be sure of is\n\nWe look for love perpetually\n\n\n\nSo I’ll solely exist\n\nSoulfully grasp each second\n\nI’ll take every risk\n\nDisconnect all fear, separateness\n\n\n\nI’m done\n\nTrying to win every battle\n\nHow can I wish to rejoice\n\nWhen my mind is stuck in this losing game?\n\n\n\nI fall\n\nDeeper and deeper in questions\n\nAll of which can only be answered\n\nBy living uncertainly\n\n\n\nSo I’ll solely exist\n\nSoulfully grasp each second\n\nI’ll take every risk\n\nDisconnect all fear, separateness\n\n\n\nBe here now\n\nDon’t look down\n\nBe here with me\n\n\n\nSo I’ll solely exist\n\nSoulfully grasp each second",
