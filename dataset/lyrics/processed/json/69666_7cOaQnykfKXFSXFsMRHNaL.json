  "lyrics": "I'm back on the road\r\nSometimes I don't know\r\nIt's hard to make good sense of it all\r\nWhen I have to roam \nMy mind's back at home\n\nThinking of you there all alone\n\n\n\nBut we're doing well\n\nSomehow I can tell\n\nI really don't know \n\nIt's something I feel \n\n\n\nCos we've been making it strong\n\nEach day right along\n\nThough we both hate being alone\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nIt's gotta be magic\n\nwe're still in tune\n\nthere's good loving\n\nmidnight or noon\n\n\n\nIt's gotta be magic\n\nI know it's true\n\nCos it's still working \n\nFor me and you\n\n\n\nWe keep saying goodbye\n\nWe keep on wondering why\n\nthough we both know it just has to be\n\n\n\nOh but honey the road\n\nCan get to be such a load\n\nYou're all that helps me make it I know\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus 2x",
