  "lyrics": "Stay\r\nUntil the morning light reveals my ruins\r\nI was starving, now I hunger\r\nTo feel\r\nAnd let your curiosity dismantle me\n\nNow I just need your breath\n\nLike a veil upon my skin\n\n\n\nCome lay with me\n\nThis chemistry is static\n\nLike space debris\n\nWe're perfectly chaotic\n\nSo come and merge your storm with mine\n\nAnd save me\n\n\n\nStay\n\nHold me as I'm trying to survive\n\nAnd wrap me in your comfort\n\nMy fears\n\nI give them all to you to keep\n\nThem safe for me\n\n\n\nCause I just need your breath\n\nLike a veil upon my skin\n\n\n\nCome lay with me\n\nThis chemistry is static\n\nLike space debris\n\nWe're perfectly chaotic\n\nSo come and merge your storm with mine\n\nAnd save me",
