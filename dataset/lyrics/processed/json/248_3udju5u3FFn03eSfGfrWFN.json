  "lyrics": "Escape the noise to find a voice\r\nWhat kind of sound that I need\r\nLife in a familiar place\r\nWhat fills the void that we need\r\nBreathing with no air\n\nCan't hear my echoes\n\nWhen I scream out, I'm craving gravity\n\nI'm not gonna shipwreck\n\nAnd get stranded with no end in sight\n\nI need an anchor, my gravity\n\n\n\nEven though I'm not in the same sun when I fall\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart\n\nI can feel your love from a different place, that's okay\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart\n\n\n\nEmbrace the strange, close to sane\n\nI don't belong here anyway\n\n[?] or visiting\n\nAnd out the gate, you're soothing\n\n\n\nBreathing with no air\n\nCan't hear my echoes\n\nWhen I scream out, I'm craving gravity\n\n\n\nEven though I'm not in the same sun when I fall\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart\n\nI can feel your love from a different place, that's okay\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart\n\n\n\n(Not gonna shipwreck and get stranded with no end in sight)\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here in my heart\n\n(Not gonna shipwreck and get stranded with no end in sight)\n\nDon't have to be miles apart if you're here",
