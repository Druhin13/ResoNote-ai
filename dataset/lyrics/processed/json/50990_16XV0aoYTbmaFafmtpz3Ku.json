  "lyrics": "Your mama was a doctor\r\nMama was a fire alarm\r\nEastern European, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone\r\n'Cause you know I like the view\r\nEvery single time I look at you\r\nThey raised you kinda proper\n\nRaised you like a soldier girl\n\nBut I know you're softer\n\nWhy you looking so concerned?\n\nI know you don't like PDA\n\nBut just for now, I think that it's okay\n\n\n\nSo hold me close and kiss me now in the fake Grand Central\n\nYour hair tied up with a broken pencil\n\n\n\nCouple next to ya\n\nSays \"Go get a hotel room\"\n\n'Cause they never felt this way\n\nSo disapproving\n\nThey don't like what we're doing\n\nWe don't have no time to waste\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\n\n\nGet you in the bedroom\n\nThen you set the world on fire\n\nBut outside of your cocoon\n\nIt's like I'm just another guy\n\nBecause you're so preoccupied\n\nWhy you think that stranger's gonna mind?\n\nIf you come a little closer\n\nForget about your suitcase babe\n\n'Cause you know when we're older\n\nWe're gonna laugh about today\n\nSoon you'll be so far away\n\nAnd I'm just gonna have to sublimate\n\nIf you can't say it, write a letter, kinda confidential\n\nSign your name with a broken pencil\n\n\n\nCouple next to ya\n\nSays \"Go get a hotel room\"\n\n'Cause they never felt this way\n\nSo disapproving\n\nThey don't like what we're doing\n\nWe don't have no time to waste\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\n\n\nSo baby I just need a memory to sustain me\n\n'Cause I get so crazy worried that you'll go and replace me\n\nSo show me with an action that on the train you won't get plastered\n\nAnd hook up with some model slash actor in the bathroom\n\nAll that I need is a confirmation by making a scene in the station\n\nBefore they call\n\nTell the children to look away\n\nYou'll be on the train\n\nRollin' away, rollin' away\n\n\n\nCouple next to ya\n\nSays \"Go get a hotel room\"\n\n'Cause they never felt this way\n\nSo disapproving\n\nThey don't like what we're doing\n\nWe don't have no time to waste\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\n\n\nCouple next to ya\n\nSays \"Go get a hotel room\"\n\n'Cause they never felt this way\n\nSo disapproving\n\nThey don't like what we're doing\n\nWe don't have no time to waste\n\nIt's just a little PDA\n\nIt's just a little PDA",
