  "lyrics": "I am talking in my sleep\r\nHiding inside my dreams\r\nFighting inside my head\r\nScaring myself to death\r\nWe live in a wonderland\r\nLike blood isn't on our hands\n\nWhen will it be enough?\n\n\n\nWhen will I say I knew we had to get away?\n\nKnew we had to get away, knew we had to get away\n\nFrom the storm\n\n\n\nCan't live forever with my head in the clouds\n\nCan't predict the weather with my feet on the ground\n\nYou tell me that it'll be alright\n\nBut I don't know if you're right\n\nI can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds\n\n\n\nLie, I'm counting every sheep\n\nBut these rabbit holes run deep\n\nTrying to be so right\n\nDesperate to start a fight\n\nAll of this pointless talk\n\nWhy can't I turn it off?\n\nWhen will it all just stop?\n\n\n\nWhen will I say I knew we had to get away?\n\nKnew we had to get away, knew we had to get away\n\nAll along\n\n\n\nCan't live forever with my head in the clouds\n\nCan't predict the weather with my feet on the ground\n\nYou tell me that it'll be alright\n\nBut I don't know if you're right\n\nI can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds\n\n\n\nCan't live forever with my head in the clouds\n\nCan't predict the weather with my feet on the ground\n\nYou tell me that it'll be alright\n\nBut I don't know if you're right\n\nI can't live forever with my head and my heart in the clouds",
