  "lyrics": "Seven billion hungry ghosts\r\nJust a parasite killing its host\r\nThe emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones\r\nBut we're buried by modern misery\r\nModern misery\n\nThere's not enough water in the world\n\nTo wash the blood from our hands\n\nWe planted a seed, its roots will suffocate the soul\n\nIt grows without light and feeds from our bones\n\nHell must be empty, all the devils are here\n\nSinging us the Lord's Prayer; finally, something that we all share\n\n\n\nI won't go to the grave with the song still in me\n\n\n\nWhat are we hiding in the rain?\n\nThis is a prison for lost souls\n\nAnother life circles the drain\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\nNow we can't see the forest\n\n'Cause there's no light in the black hole\n\nDon't try and tell me we are blessed\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\n\n\nAre these our new messiahs?\n\n'Cause the saviour has a gun to my head\n\nDon't be fooled by Maya, the kings are all thieves\n\nAnd the serpents will bite as they please\n\nHow has it come to this?\n\n\n\nI won't go to the grave with the song still in me\n\nAnd I won't live like a slave begging from my knees\n\n\n\nWhat are we hiding in the rain?\n\nThis is a prison for lost souls\n\nAnother life circles the drain\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\nNow we can't see the forest\n\n'Cause there's no light in the black hole\n\nDon't try and tell me we are blessed\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\n\n\nSeven billion hungry ghosts\n\nJust a parasite killing its host\n\nThe emperor wears no clothes, I see those brittle bones\n\nBut we're buried by modern misery\n\nModern misery\n\nI won't live like a slave, I won't beg from my knees\n\nI will not go to the grave with the song still in me\n\n\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\nWe used to run with the wolves\n\nWe used to run with the wolves",
