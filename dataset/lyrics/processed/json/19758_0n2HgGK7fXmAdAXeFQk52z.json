  "lyrics": "All these ideas keep swimming, running through your head. \nQuick, we'll drown them with this fix. \nThe dose to stop your shaking, the one to silence your voice. \nJust take it and you'll be fine. \nCalm, relaxed, obedient, just the way we want you. \nYour thoughts are ours to manipulate. \n\nYour actions are ours to control. \n\nYour opinions are a thing of the past,\n\nso tilt your head back and swallow this. \n\nYou've become a real team player, a real class act. \n\nNo one cares about your identity. Open wide, here it comes. \n\nThis prescription makes you perfect",
