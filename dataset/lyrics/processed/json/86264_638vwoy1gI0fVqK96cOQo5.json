  "lyrics": "If you see me walkin' down the street And I start to cry each time we meet Walk on by, walk on by Make believe that you don't see the tears I Just let me grieve in private 'cause each time I see you I break down and cryWalk on by Walk on by Walk on byI just can't get over losin' you And so if I seem broken and blue Walk on by, walk on by Foolish pride that's all that I have left So let me hide the tears and The sadness you gave me When you said good-byeWalk on by Walk on by Walk on by",
