  "lyrics": "Hand me down Ostrich boots, Dark wash Levis\r\nRay Bay Wayfarers on bloodshot eyes\r\nI dress like my daddy did, circa 1982\r\nI make old school look brand new\r\nRaised on George Strait, Alan Jackson, and Pat Green\n\nLearned how to pick from a VHS\n\nMama taught me how to sing\n\nSit out on the front porch\n\nThe crickets and coyotes sing harmony\n\nWe make old school sound brand new\n\n\n\nIt’s tried and true, I ain’t leaving soon or going out of style\n\nSo march around in your cowboy boots, swagger, and a smile\n\nSome call it classic, even old fashioned\n\nAnd others call it cool\n\nI call it old school\n\nWell, how bout you?\n\nHow bout you?\n\n\n\nMama and Pop’s love still running like that ’82 Chevrolet\n\nThe same one that they brought brand new on their wedding day\n\nThey still drive around town with the windows down\n\nCause they’re more in love than the day they said “I do”\n\nIt’s true\n\nCause they make old school feel brand new\n\n\n\nIt’s tried and true, I ain’t leaving soon or going out of style\n\nSo dance around in your old pearl snaps, swagger, and a smile\n\nSome call it classic, even old fashioned\n\nAnd others call it cool\n\nI call it old school\n\nWell, how bout you?\n\nI call it old school\n\nWell, how bout you?\n\nWoo-hoo!",
