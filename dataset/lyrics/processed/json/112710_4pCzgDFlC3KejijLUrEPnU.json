  "lyrics": "It must have been a year since\r\nI was thrown across an ocean far from home\r\nAnd I was making oceans\r\nRiding in between the highs and lows\r\nWoah, when awake in the morning I\n\nYou is the first on my mind\n\n\n\nMaybe what I miss most\n\nIt wasn't made of steel and stones\n\nAnd maybe what I miss most\n\nIt wasn't born of skin and bone\n\nUnder the sun, up on the waves\n\nUnder three climbs when I'm far away\n\nMaybe what I miss most\n\n\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\n\n\nLife beyond the window\n\nI'm jealous of the way the black bird flies\n\nFree among the people\n\nThose quarter million stories pass me by\n\n\n\nWoah, I awake in the moonlight I\n\nYou is the last on my mind\n\n\n\nAnd maybe what I miss most\n\nIt wasn't made of steel and stones\n\nAnd maybe what I miss most\n\nIt wasn't born of skin and bone\n\nUnder the sun, up on the waves\n\nUnder three climbs and I'm far away\n\nMaybe what I miss most\n\n\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\n\n\nI remember on the table\n\nAll those faces, where did they go?\n\nI imagine how it looks like\n\nWhen I'm not there\n\nI remember, every summer\n\nBut now that years are, just a number\n\nThere's no backroots\n\nTime is faster with everything I've left behind\n\n\n\nAnd maybe what I miss most\n\nIt wasn't made of steel and stones\n\nAnd maybe what I miss most\n\nIt wasn't born of skin and bone\n\nCause under the sun, up on the waves\n\nUnder three climbs and I'm far away\n\nMaybe what I miss most\n\n\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know\n\nAnd maybe you'll never know",
