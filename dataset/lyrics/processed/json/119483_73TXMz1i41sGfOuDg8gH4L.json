  "lyrics": "Goodbye Norma Jean\r\nThough I never knew you at all\r\nYou had the grace to hold yourself\r\nWhile those around you crawled\r\nThey crawled out of the woodwork\r\nAnd they whispered into your brain\n\nThey set you on the treadmill\n\nAnd they made you change your name\n\n\n\nAnd it seems to me you lived your life\n\nLike a candle in the wind\n\nNever knowing who to cling to\n\nWhen the rain set in\n\nAnd I would have liked to have known you\n\nBut I was just a kid\n\nYour candle burned out long before\n\nYour legend ever did\n\n\n\nLoneliness was tough\n\nThe toughest role you ever played\n\nHollywood created a superstar\n\nAnd pain was the price you paid\n\nEven when you died\n\nOh the press still hounded you\n\nAll the papers had to say\n\nWas that Marilyn was found in the nude\n\n\n\nGoodbye Norma Jean\n\nFrom the young man in the 22nd row\n\nWho sees you as something as more than sexual\n\nMore than just our Marilyn Monroe",
