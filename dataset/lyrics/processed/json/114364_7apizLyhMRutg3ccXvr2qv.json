  "lyrics": "Taking it slowly\r\nI'm afraid to be lonely\r\nNobody told me\r\nIt's harder than I thought to tell the truth\r\nIt's gonna leave you in pieces\r\nAll alone with your demons\n\nAnd I know that we need this\n\nBut I've been too afraid to follow through\n\n\n\nHold me close and I won't leave\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody\n\nSo much to say but I don't speak\n\nAnd I hate that I let you stop me\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody\n\n\n\nDon't know where the time went\n\nStuck in the wrong mindset\n\nI let the rules bend\n\nWhen I know that all along they're made to break\n\nYou got me searching for reasons\n\nTo keep me from leaving\n\nAnd that I have trouble breathing\n\nI give myself another chance to stay\n\n\n\nHold me close and I won't leave\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody\n\nSo much to say but I don't speak\n\nAnd I hate that I let you stop me\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody\n\n\n\nOne day before you know it, you will see\n\nAll of the pain and all the harmony\n\nYou'll feel the stinging and you think of me\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt\n\n\n\nHold me close and I won't leave\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody\n\nSo much to say but I don't speak\n\nAnd I hate that I let you stop me\n\nHold me close and I won't leave\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody\n\nSo much to say but I don't speak\n\nAnd I hate that I let you stop me\n\n'Cause it hurts when you hurt somebody",
