  "lyrics": "Well, I didn't know him best\r\nHe'd say we were friends\r\nWe both rode the highways on the song\r\nSo I'm writing this one here in memory of him\r\n'Cause the King of Alabama has gone home\n\nHe was a man among men, the old-school kind\n\nHad a great big heart, a laid-back mind\n\nLet you hold his guitar if you broke his string\n\nIf you thought he looked country, outta heard him sing\n\n\n\nFrom Alabama 'cross the Rio Grande\n\nHe beat the blacktop down with a five-piece band\n\nNot because he loved it - he did that too -\n\nBut he did it man 'cause that's what he was born to do\n\n\n\nSome people calculate moves\n\nHe never had a thing to prove\n\nHe just let the wind take him where it may\n\nIt's a damn shame the way things go\n\nIt's too bad we have to lose the good folks\n\nBut the King of Alabama has gone home\n\n\n\n\"Nothin' good ever happens after midnight,\" so the story goes\n\nYou can't trust nobody, it don't matter how close\n\nIt was a friend that took him from his family\n\nI keep his chain in my pocket, his son in my prayers\n\nEvery stage I'm on, I can feel him there\n\n\n\nSome people calculate moves\n\nHe never had a thing to prove\n\nHe just let the wind take him where it may\n\nIt's a damn shame the way things go\n\nIt's too bad we have to lose the good folks\n\nBut the King of Alabama has gone home\n\n\n\nSome people calculate moves\n\nHe never had a thing to prove\n\nHe just let the wind take him where it may\n\nHe'd say Honky tonk's the trick\n\nBut get a guitar and grab your pick\n\nLet the old tunes possess you and play yeah\n\nIt's a damn shame the way things go\n\nIt's too bad we have to lose the good folks\n\nBut the King of Alabama\n\nThe King of Alabama\n\nThe King of Alabama has gone home",
