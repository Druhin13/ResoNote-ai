  "lyrics": "I don't want to start another new debate\r\nâ€˜Cause when I turn the news on\r\nAll I feel is heartbreak\r\nLeft, right hate on both sides\r\nOh will we ever learn, we can stop drawing line\r\nEnemy lines, enemy lines\n\n\n\nI want to hear before I speak\n\nOffer grace before critique\n\nI want to live like I've got no enemies\n\nLord help me, Lord help me\n\nTo love anyway\n\n\n\nYou told me that the battle isn't flesh and blood\n\nBut when safety is my idol, it's impossible to trust\n\nRace, guns, refugee wars\n\nWe're known for who we're against\n\nYeah, but who are we for?\n\nWho are we for? Who are we fighting for?\n\n\n\nI want to hear before I speak\n\nOffer grace before critique\n\nI want to live like I've got no enemies\n\nLord help me, Lord help me\n\nTo love anyway\n\n\n\nTeach me how to turn\n\nTurn the other cheek\n\nShow me how to bless\n\nEven those who threaten me\n\nTeach me how to turn (to turn)\n\nTurn the other cheek (other cheek)\n\nShow me how to bless (how to bless)\n\nEven those who threaten me (threaten me)\n\nTo love them how You love me\n\n\n\nI wanna hear before I speak\n\nOffer grace before critique\n\nI wanna live like I got no enemies\n\nLord help me, Lord help me\n\nTo love anyway, love anyway\n\nTo love anyway, love anyway\n\nLove anyway, oh, love anyway\n\n\n\nShow me how to love them how You love me\n\nShow me how to love them how You love me",
