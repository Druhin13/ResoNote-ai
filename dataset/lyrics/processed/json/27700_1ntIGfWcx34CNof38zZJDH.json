  "lyrics": "After everything I've been through\r\nYou've got the nerve to walk in my shoes?\r\nEverything could've been simple\r\nTill you went and talked a shit load\r\nNow I'm nothing, new Justin Bieber\r\nLike what I work for I don't deserve\n\nThink that I'll go soft like Weezer?\n\nNot until the sky is filled with Ether\n\nI'm the Grim Reaper, look in your mirror\n\nAnd let these words bring you a little bit nearer\n\nI always gotta watch my back 'cause some chump\n\nFrom way back didn't want my ass blowing up\n\nYeah, I always gotta hold my sack 'cause some slut\n\nMay claim that we're lovers when all we did was fuck!\n\n\n\nSo you wanna be famous?\n\nYou wanna be just like me, shameless?\n\nLiving in the fast lane but you're nameless\n\nYou wanna change the game? You'll never change this\n\nSo you wanna be famous?\n\nYou wanna be just like me, take this\n\nLike it's your last day, it's your last wish?\n\nYou wanna change the game? You'll never change this\n\n\n\nYou think you can be just like me\n\nStrike with lightning and leave so easy?\n\nAll these wannabe Slim Shady\n\nSound-a-likes just drive me crazy\n\nI know you wanna be hated\n\nBefore you push up them daisies\n\nYou ain't motherfucking mainstream\n\nAin't never gonna be with no Beyonce\n\nYou can't see me, mysteriously\n\nJust let yourself, follow me now so freely\n\nI always gotta watch my back 'cause some chump\n\nFrom way back didn't want my ass blowing up\n\nYeah, I always gotta hold my sack 'cause some slut\n\nMay claim that we're lovers when all we did was fuck!\n\n\n\nSo you wanna be famous?\n\nYou wanna be just like me, shameless?\n\nLiving in the fast lane but you're nameless\n\nYou wanna change the game? You'll never change this\n\nSo you wanna be famous?\n\nYou wanna be just like me, take this\n\nLike it's your last day, it's your last wish?\n\nYou wanna change the game? You'll never change this\n\n\n\nNo one in the game is\n\nOn my level, can't get up to where I take this\n\nI am the devil and no one can fucking tame this\n\nGo grab a shovel, I'mma dig your fucking grave, pricks\n\nThen I'mma take a shit on your fucking faces\n\nBefore I bury you, I'm going through some changes\n\nI know it's scaring you to feel the pain and anguish\n\nIt isn't fair to you, Gadjet is the greatest\n\nHe don't compare to you, all haters on hiatus, they gon' have to hate us later\n\nSomewhere in the afterlife 'cause up in this really can't fade us\n\nEven then they won't be able, fuck a name and fuck a label\n\nFuck everything, I'm not clinically sane, they got the papers\n\n\n\nSo you wanna be famous?\n\nYou wanna be just like me, shameless?\n\nLiving in the fast lane but you're nameless\n\nYou wanna change the game? You'll never change this\n\nSo you wanna be famous?\n\nYou wanna be just like me, take this\n\nLike it's your last day, it's your last wish?\n\nYou wanna change the game? You'll never change this\n\n\n\nMiley, your camel toe makes me sick\n\nAdam Levine's got a small-ass dick\n\nI wanna keep on talking shit\n\nTill I'm filthy fucking rich\n\nGaga, your monsters can suck on this\n\nWhile Elton John needs a salad, bitch\n\nI'm not gonna get in the music biz\n\nBut I'm still gonna profit from it",
