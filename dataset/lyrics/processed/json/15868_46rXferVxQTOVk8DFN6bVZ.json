  "lyrics": "She sits there crying in\r\nI sit here wondering what I did\r\nShe said you're lying again\r\nI feel so twisted I could cave\r\n\"I think you'd rather have me dead\"\n\nSay all the voices in my head\n\nI know you'd rather have me dead\n\nHit me right here next to me\n\nTo put me out my misery\n\n\n\nShe takes me out her cinnamon room\n\nI think it's far too soon but Jesus says we're too far gone\n\nAnd I'd say \"let's go on a break, I don't want to feel this way\"\n\nShe grabs a knife and tells me poisons are her thing\n\n\n\n\"I think you'd rather have me dead\"\n\nSay all the voices in my head\n\nI know you'd rather have me dead\n\nHit me right here next to me\n\nTo put me out my misery\n\n\n\nAnd maybe tomorrow\n\nOr someday far\n\nWe'll trip down to the station, yeah\n\nWe're on our way now\n\nSo don't you tell me you think you have wasted\n\nAll your precious time my dear\n\nAnd even if I'm really addicted to silence\n\nWell I'll come back to you, back to you, back to you\n\nWhen you're freed from your ways\n\nI come back every day and\n\n\n\n\"I think you'd rather have me dead\"\n\nSay all the voices in my head\n\nI know you'd rather have me dead\n\nYou'd be right here next to me\n\nTo put me out my misery\n\n\n\nI know you'd rather have me dead",
