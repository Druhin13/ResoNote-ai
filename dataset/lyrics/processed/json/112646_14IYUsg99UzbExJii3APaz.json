  "lyrics": "I was getting kinda tired of her endless chatter\r\nNothing I could say ever seemed to matter\r\nSo I took a little drive just to clear my head\r\nI saw a flashing neon up ahead \nIt looked like a place to find some satisfaction\r\nWith a little less talk and a lot more action\n\n\n\nI paid the man at the door and pushed my way to the bar\n\nShouted for a drink over a screaming guitar\n\nA drunk on a stool tried to mess with my head\n\nBut I didn't even listen to a word he said\n\nI knew somewhere amid all this distraction\n\nWas a little less talk and a lot more action\n\n\n\nA little less talk if you please\n\nA lot more loving is what I need\n\nLet's get on down to the main attraction\n\nWith a little less talk and a lot more action\n\n\n\nWell she was fighting them off at a corner table\n\nShe had a longneck bottle she was peeling the label\n\nThe look on her face it was perfectly clear\n\nShe said somebody please get me out of here\n\nThe look she shot me through the glass refraction\n\nSaid a little less talk and a lot more action\n\n\n\nA little less talk if you please\n\nA lot more loving is what I need\n\nLet's get on down to the main attraction\n\nWith a little less talk and a lot more action\n\n\n\nA little less talk\n\nA lot more loving\n\nLet's get on down to the main attraction\n\nWith a little less talk and a lot more action\n\nGet on down to the main attraction\n\nWith a little less talk and a lot more action",
