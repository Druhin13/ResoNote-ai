  "lyrics": "The question is why, why are we here?\r\nTo say our hello's and goodbye's, then disappear\r\nThis beautiful life, what is it for?\r\nTo learn how to master peace or master war\r\nThere's only one answer that matters\n\nEven if your heart has been shattered\n\nWhatever you want, whatever you are after\n\nLove is still the answer\n\nLove is still the answer (love, love, love... love, love, love...)\n\n\n\nWe all make mistakes, no, we're not perfect yet\n\nMaybe God made us all from an accident\n\nAnd the question that sits on everyone's lips\n\nIs why should we pick ourselves up and start over again\n\n\n\nThere's only one answer that matters\n\nEven if your heart has been shattered\n\nWhatever you want, whatever you are after\n\nLove is still the answer\n\n\n\nLove is still the answer\n\nLove, love, love, love\n\nLove, love\n\nLove\n\n\n\nThe question I'll ask at the end of my days\n\nIs what did I give and what will I take\n\n\n\nThere's only one answer that matters\n\nEven if your heart and your dreams have been shattered\n\nWhatever you want, whatever you are after\n\nLove is still the answer\n\nLove is still the answer\n\n\n\nLove, love\n\nLove, love\n\nLoooove\n\nLove, love, love\n\nLove, love, love, love\n\nLove, love, love\n\n\n\nLove\n\nis\n\nstill\n\nthe answer",
