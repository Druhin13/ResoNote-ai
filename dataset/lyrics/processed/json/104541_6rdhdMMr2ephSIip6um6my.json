(Oh-whoa)\n\nTear us down, tear us down, tear us down, down\n\nWhy you tryna tear me down, tear me down? (Oh)\n\nTear me down, tear me down, tear me down, yeah\n\n\n\nYeah, if you scared, go to church, I don't blame you for it (I don’t blame you)\n\nManslaughter over murder, they gon' hang you for it\n\nIncarcerated my brother, I tried to take it for him\n\nHe on his way to the pros, he 'posed to make it for us\n\nThey'd rather break us than build us up in this broken system\n\nWe ain't no different if we ridin' 'round smokin' niggas (Yeah)\n\nI’m just thirsty for revenge, it’ll soothe the pain (Soothe it)\n\nAnd the prescriptions I be poppin' don’t reduce the pain\n\nAyy, throw your partner a package and let him do his thing\n\nHere go the load, it's a phone and you can use the change\n\nThey heard about the dirty work before they knew the name\n\nFind yourself in a pickle and try to use the name, Mozzy\n\n\n\nI'm not the only one with issues (Not around here)\n\nAll the things that I've been through (You know, you know)\n\nThis for people that relate\n\nThis for the ones we can’t replace, no (We can't replace them)\n\nWhy they tryna tear us down, tear us down? (Can you tell me why?)\n\nTear us down, tear us down, tear us down, down (Oh)\n\nWhy you tryna tear me down, tear me down? (Oh)\n\nTear me down, tear me down, tear me down",
