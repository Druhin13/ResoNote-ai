  "lyrics": "Man walking a tightrope\r\nGirl and her high hopes fall from the sky\r\nChange of plans, riding a cyclone\r\nDodging a headstone, I want what's mine\r\nRight then the walls came falling\n\nA voice came calling the night it rained in LA\n\nMirror, ask me why I don't act surprised\n\n\n\nI'm on my way\n\nOne magic moment, don't be late\n\nI'm on my way\n\nSalvation, my revelation arrives on vanity plates\n\nI'm on my way\n\n\n\nSmoke smothers a hillside\n\nBlind in my mind's eye, my city's on fire\n\nOne more joke lackin' a punchline\n\nRealized sci-fi, I'm in denial\n\n\n\nRight then the walls came falling\n\nA voice came calling the night it rained in your eyes\n\nMirror, ask me why I don't act surprised\n\n\n\nI'm on my way\n\nOne magic moment, don't be late\n\nI'm on my way\n\nSalvation, my revelation arrives on vanity plates\n\nWe go on about nothing just to talk about something\n\nI'm on my way\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nWhoa\n\n\n\nI'm on my way\n\nOne magic moment, don't be late\n\nI'm on my way\n\nSalvation, my revelation arrives on vanity plates\n\nI'm on my way\n\nOne magic moment, don't be late\n\nI'm on my way\n\nSalvation, my revelation arrives on vanity plates\n\nI'm on my way\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh, yeah, yeah\n\nOoh, ooh, yeah, yeah\n\nI'm on my way",
