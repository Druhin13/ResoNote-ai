  "lyrics": "Waiting by the side of the road\r\nFor day to break so we could go\r\nDown into Los Angeles\r\nWith dirty hands and worn out knees\r\nI keep crawling back to you\n\nI keep crawling back to you\n\n\n\nThe ranger came with burning eyes\n\nThe chambermaid awoke surprised\n\nThought she'd seen the last of him\n\nShe shook her head and let him in\n\n\n\nHey baby, there's something in your eyes\n\nTryin' to say to me\n\nThat I'm gonna be alright if I believe in you\n\nIt's all I want to do\n\n\n\nIt was me and my sidekick\n\nHe was drunk and I was sick\n\nWe were caught up in a barroom fight\n\nTill an Indian shot out the lights\n\n\n\nI'm so tired of being tired\n\nSure as night will follow day\n\nMost things I worry about\n\nNever happen anyway\n\n\n\nI keep crawling back to you\n\nI keep crawling back to you",
