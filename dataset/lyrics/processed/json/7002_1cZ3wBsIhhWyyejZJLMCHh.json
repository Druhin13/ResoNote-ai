  "lyrics": "I don't know much about sadness\r\nAnd I'm not tryna act a fool\r\nBut I've sure flirted with the madness\r\nAnd I won't watch it flirt with you\r\nWe're loving like angels in our bed\r\nBut sleeping with devils in our head\r\nI'm loving with everything that I got\r\nI'm loving with everything and won't stop\r\nI don't know if I promise\r\nI'll always know just what say\r\nBut i'm damn sure that I'll be honest\r\nAnd that I'll never run away\r\nWe're loving like angels in our bed\r\nBut sleeping with devils in our head\r\nI'm loving with everything that I got\r\nI'm loving with everything and won't stop\r\nWe're loving like angels in our bed\r\nBut sleeping with devils in our head\r\nI'm loving with everything that I got\r\nI'm loving with everything and won't stop\r\nWe're loving like angels in our bed\r\nBut sleeping with devils in our head\r\nWe're loving with everything that we got\r\nWe're loving with everything and won't stop",
