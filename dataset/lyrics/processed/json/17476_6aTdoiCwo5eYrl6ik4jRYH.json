  "lyrics": "What's enough for you is not for me\r\nYou want to fall in love but not too deep\r\nWELL I CAN'T STAND IT\r\nDon't look away, I want you to stay\r\nAll that you need is to stand in the fire\r\nAnd bow to your rage, tear down the gate\n\nShow your fears and desires to me\n\n\n\nAnd just keep burning on\n\nIt's a lot like breathing\n\nAnd just keep burning on ...\n\nTil you're addicted to feeling\n\nWe just keep burning (on)\n\nSo you can love like you mean it\n\n\n\nYou have spent your life avoiding pain\n\nBut beauty lies in that which is not safe\n\nCAN'T YOU FEEL IT?\n\nJust look at me, I said look at me!\n\nI want you to see how I feel when I'm aching\n\nAnd desperate to breathe, you'll do anything\n\nWhen you know you're alive..\n\nYou are free\n\n\n\nAnd just keep burning on\n\nIt's a lot like breathing\n\nAnd just keep burning on ...\n\nTil you're addicted to feeling\n\nWe just keep burning (on)\n\nSo you can love like you mean it\n\n\n\nAnd if you wanna see the brightest colours\n\nAnd if you wanna live your wildest dreams\n\nI can tell you it's real...\n\nCoz it happened to me...\n\nI just keep burning on and on, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd just keep burning on\n\nIt's a lot like breathing\n\nAnd just keep burning on ...\n\nTil you're addicted to feeling\n\nWe just keep burning (on)\n\nSo you can love like you mean it",
