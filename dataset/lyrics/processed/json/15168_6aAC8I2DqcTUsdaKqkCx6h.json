  "lyrics": "Most nights I snack on pieces of toast\r\nI donʼt talk to anybody but my grandfatherʼs ghost\r\nI mean its times like these\r\nThat make me love me the most\r\nWhen I try to crack a smile\r\nWithout a drink and a toast\n\nWash them dishes then Iʼm folding my clothes\n\nWe ainʼt had nothing back when I pretended I wasn't cold\n\nI mean its times like these that make ‘em love me the most\n\nTake that pain and let it drip onto the stage at the show, yeah\n\nWho I am is not what I wear\n\nIʼm grounded\n\nI think Iʼll hold myself up for something bigger\n\nWhere I stand is not what I stand for\n\nIʼm founded\n\nI think I hold those values in front of triggers\n\nCause I\n\nI got the mindset\n\n\n\nAy, now Iʼm snatching pieces of gold\n\nI ainʼt goinʼ broke not one day see what the future will hold\n\nI guess its times like these that make shrug and be bold\n\nMight get a new Lamborghini just say fuck it and roll, yeah\n\nLifeʼs getting pretty stale as it goes\n\nI fill that lonely feeling up with pretty women and smoke\n\nI guess its times like these that make me realize Iʼm old\n\nWe take that pain and then I sniff it through a hole in the nose yeah\n\nWho I am is not who I was Iʼm silent\n\nI never held myself up for something bigger\n\nWhere I stand in front of a mirror crying\n\nI just tell myself that I should pull the trigger cause\n\nCause I, I, I\n\n\n\nI got the mindset",
