  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ignite par K-391\r\n[Julie Bergan]\nFireflies, a million little pieces\nFeeds the dying light, and breathes me back to life\nIn your eyes, I see something to believe in\nYour hands are like a flame\nYour palms the sweetest pain\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nLet the darkness lead us into the light\nLet our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise\nBaby, tell me one more beautiful lie\nOne touch and I ignite\nLike a starship speeding into the night\nYou and I get lost in the infinite lights\n\nBaby, tell me one more beautiful lie\nOne touch and I ignite\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nOne touch and I ignite\nOne touch and I ignite\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nSo alive, your touch is like the daylight\nBurning on my skin, it turns me on again\nYou and I, survivors of the same kind\nAnd we're the only ones\nDancing on the sun\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nLet the darkness lead us into the light\nLet our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise\n\nBaby, tell me one more beautiful lie\nOne touch and I ignite\nLike a starship speeding into the night\nYou and I get lost in the infinite lights\nBaby, tell me one more beautiful lie\nOne touch and I ignite\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nOne touch and I ignite\nOne touch and I ignite\n\n[Seungri]\nDiamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight\nWe're monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life\nJust like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars\n\nHear you calling for me\nHear you calling me on from afar\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nLet the darkness lead us into the light\nLet our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise\nBaby, tell me one more beautiful lie\nOne touch and I ignite\nI feel the heat as we collide\nLike a fever that feels so right\nSo baby, tell me one more beautiful lie\nOne touch and I ignite\n\n[Julie Bergan]\nOne touch and I ignite\nOne touch and I ignite\nOne touch and I ignite\n\nOne touch and I ignite\nOne touch and I ignite",
