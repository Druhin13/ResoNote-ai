  "lyrics": "I want to be the one you miss when you're alone\r\nI want to be the one you're kissing when you're stoned\r\nBack in the alleyway behind your father's home\r\nI'm clawing at your skin, trying to see your bones\r\nI want to be the one who keeps you up at night\n\nCling to the memory of how I brushed your sides\n\n'Cause I'm just a puzzle piece trying to fit just right\n\nSo hard to be someone who's stuck inside your mind\n\n\n\nFalling into myself\n\nYou're still in, you're still in my\n\nSkin, skin\n\nI just wish you also felt like this\n\n\n\nI want to be the one who makes your stomach tied\n\nI want to make you mine and drag you like a kite\n\n'Cause there's just something that keeps you on my mind\n\nWhen I see your human skin, diverts me off your thighs\n\n\n\nFalling into myself\n\nYou're still in, you're still in my\n\nSkin, skin\n\nI just wish you also felt like\n\nThis, when we kiss\n\nBalled up fist, grabbin' at your\n\nSkin, skin\n\nI just wish you also felt like this",
