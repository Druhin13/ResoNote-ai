  "lyrics": "Here she comes down the street and that look is in her eye\r\nAnd the way she looks, if looks could kill they might\r\nAll the kids down in the street run away\r\nWhen she goes by it's the end of the day\r\nSo believe what they say, there's danger in the air\n\nLook through a window and you'll see her standing there\n\nShe's the latest of the greatest with the wind blowin' in her hair\n\nThe prima donna she's back in town\n\nAnd you see her for miles around\n\nSo believe what they say there's danger in the air\n\n\n\nChorus: Beware there's danger ahead\n\nThe endless summer is dead\n\nLook out there's danger ahead\n\n\n\nMonday mornin' she's already up and gone\n\nShe knows what she wants and she knew it all along\n\nWith her entourage on either side\n\nJust one look she can't be denied\n\nSo believe what they say there's danger in the air\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nShe's got a reputation that's way ahead of her time\n\nShe's got adulation that's way ahead of her mind\n\nEverybody runs around to please\n\nWhen she looks in the mirror she just has to freeze\n\nSo believe what they say there's danger in the air\n\n\n\nChorus",
