  "lyrics": "You've got a new tattoo\r\nDead on arrival types outplay me\r\nYou only like bad news\r\nSleep in your coffin like a baby\r\nBeautiful trees outside\r\nSky is a bright blue, you see storm clouds\n\nStorm clouds\n\n\n\nYou think it's hot to be sad, but it's not\n\nYou're an ex prom queen slippin' stones in your docks\n\nYou're in a circle of people with fun that's illegal\n\nYou act like a cop, you're the sequel that sucks\n\nDoors always have their locks\n\nLike, why even try when we're already fucked?\n\nGot your hands on a laptop, facing the mud, just stop\n\n\n\nYou give me bad vibes, bad times\n\nBad nights with you\n\nYeah, I get bad energy\n\nSick pleasure from you\n\n\n\nRollin' a cigarette\n\nWhen you know that smoking causes cancer\n\nSay that it's just depressing\n\nWhen basic girls sing \"Tiny Dancer\"\n\nSip all your drinks on ice, no surprise\n\nYour backyard's filled with stray cats\n\nAnd that's sad\n\n\n\nYou think it's cooler to have dark thoughts\n\nNever eat ice cream, only take white drugs\n\nIn a circle of people without any reason to love\n\nYou're a god, I've been screaming a lot\n\nHow is the earth so hot?\n\nLike, why even try when it's already fucked?\n\nGot your hands on a laptop, facing the mud, just stop\n\n\n\nYou give me bad vibes, bad times\n\nBad nights with you\n\nYeah, I get bad energy\n\nSick pleasure from you\n\n\n\nYou can't drag me down, you can't drag me down\n\nYou can't drag me down, you can't drag me down\n\n'Cause I feel good\n\nYeah, I'm real good\n\nSaid I feel good\n\nDamn, I feel good\n\n\n\nYou give me bad vibes, bad times\n\nBad nights with you\n\nYeah, I get bad energy\n\nSick pleasure from you\n\nYou give me bad vibes, bad times\n\nBad nights with you\n\nYeah, I get bad energy\n\nSick pleasure from you",
