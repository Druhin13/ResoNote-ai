  "lyrics": "Almost all my life they told me that I couldn't\r\nDreaming every night they told me that I shouldn't\r\nTold me that I should've quit that I'll never finish it\r\nThat I'll never reach the top and no one knows that I exist\r\nBut I kept climbing, kept grinding every day\r\nAnd I kept writing everything I had to say\n\nNow they wanna shut me up, shut me in, shut me out\n\nYeah I'd be mad to if someone made me shut my mouth\n\nBut it's different, when you never had a voice\n\nWhen no one ever listened so you never had a choice\n\nNever had a path only people in your way\n\nNever had a mask or a reason to be fake\n\nAll you had was you and a reason to succeed\n\nAll you had to do was keep believing in the dream\n\nAll you ever knew was being weak and on your knees\n\nBut you're only gonna lose if you don't learn from your defeats\n\n\n\n(Yeah, gotta make the world know my name)\n\n\n\nI've got my head in the clouds\n\nMy feet on the ground\n\nYeah, I'm standing out and I am not afraid\n\nWith my head in the clouds\n\nNever looking down\n\nYeah, I'll never stop\n\nUntil the world knows my name\n\n\n\nI wish I could go back\n\nBack when we were kids\n\nWhen everything had passion\n\nWith everything we did\n\nEverything was honest\n\nEverything that we were promised\n\nAnd the thought of what we wanted\n\nIs what makes it so ironic that its different\n\nThan the shit that we were told\n\nHow the rules were written how the story really goes\n\nEveryone's your friend, give everyone a chance\n\nSo everyone pretends that they really give a damn\n\nMan fuck that\n\nNothing's ever what it seems\n\nPeople stepping over people, people praying on the weak\n\nCause its business and we're feeding the machine\n\nTime is money, money's living so we live with the disease\n\nWhat happened to the magic, what happened to the thrill\n\nWhat happened to the passion, the way we used to feel\n\nAll we see is fashion, fame and dollar bills\n\nAnd now I'm looking back I wish the world I saw was real\n\n\n\nI've got my head in the clouds\n\nMy feet on the ground\n\nYeah, I'm standing out and I am not afraid\n\nWith my head in the clouds\n\nNever looking down\n\nYeah, I'll never stop\n\nUntil the world knows my name\n\n\n\nI woke up one day with the world outside telling me I should walk away\n\nBut I can't, I won't break, that's how I know it everything will be okay\n\nI woke up one day with the world outside telling me I should walk away\n\nBut I can't, I won't break, that's how I know that everything will be okay\n\nI woke up one day with the world outside telling me I should walk away\n\nBut I can't, I won't break, I'll make the world know my name﻿\n\n\n\nI've got my head in the clouds\n\nMy feet on the ground\n\nYeah, I'm standing out and I am not afraid\n\nWith my head in the clouds\n\nNever looking down\n\nYeah, I'll never stop\n\nUntil the world knows my name\n\n\n\nI woke up one day with the world outside telling me I should walk away\n\nBut I can't, I won't break, I'll make the world know my name﻿\n\nI woke up one day with the world outside telling me I should walk away\n\nBut I can't, I won't break, I'll make the world know my name",
