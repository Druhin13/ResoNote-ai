  "lyrics": "To find, to find the exact words,\r\nto find the perfect words, \nto say less but to say more, \nwas ideal for this project\r\nand till my energy and mind be felt, \nin a less aggressive way \n\nbut a more passive and genius way \n\nwas ideal with this album, \n\nto show the versatility and to show th- to open minds \n\nin a self was the goal of this album, \n\nand to acquire a large amount of passion, \n\nand love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album\n\nloyalty to myself was the goal of this album. \n\nSo, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; \n\nif you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. \n\nIf you don't listen to the alternative sound \n\nand you've never been into the alternative sound \n\nand have not been open to trying different things; \n\nopen your mind before you listen to this album. \n\nYou can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, \n\nyour car, but it can be played anywhere. \n\nThis album is far different, far more versatile, \n\nfar more uplifting than the last. \n\nIt's something you can find comfort in, \n\nit's very comforting but discomforting at the same time. \n\nSo, with this project, again me entering your mind. \n\nFeeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy. Enjoy",
