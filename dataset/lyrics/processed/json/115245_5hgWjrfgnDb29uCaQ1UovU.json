  "lyrics": "I call you, to see you again\r\nSo I can win, and this can finally end\r\nSpend an hour doing my makeup\r\nTo prove something\r\nWalk up in my high heels\n\nAll high and mighty\n\nAnd you say, \"Hello\"\n\nAnd I lose\n\n\n\n'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and\n\nNobody fucks me like me\n\n\n\nIn the morning, in a taxi\n\nI'm so very paying for-\n\nWhy am I lonely for lonesome love?\n\nWhy am I lonely for lonesome love?\n\nWhy am I lonely?",
