  "lyrics": "I wandered so aimless life filled with sin\r\nI wouldn't let my dear Savior in\r\nThen Jesus came like a stranger in the night\r\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\r\nI saw the light, I saw the light\n\nNo more darkness, no more night\n\nNow I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\n\n\n\nJust like a blind man I wandered alone\n\nWorries and fears I claimed for my own\n\nThen like the blind man that God gave back his sight\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\n\n\n\nI saw the light, I saw the light\n\nNo more darkness, no more night\n\nNow I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\n\n\n\nI was a fool to wander and stray\n\nStraight is the gate and narrow's the way\n\nNow I have traded the wrong for the right\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\n\n\n\nI saw the light, I saw the light\n\nNo more darkness, no more night\n\nNow I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light\n\n\n\nPraise the Lord, I saw the light",
