  "lyrics": "The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us\rFootsteps follow, down through the hollow sound, torn up\rAnd you will go to Mykonos\rWith a vision of a gentle coast\rAnd a sun to maybe dissipate\rShadows of the mess you made\rHow did any holes in the snow tipped pines, I find\rHatching from the seed of your thin mind, all night?\rAnd you will go to Mykonos\rWith a vision of a gentle coast\rAnd a sun to maybe dissipate\rShadows of the mess you made\rBrother you don't need to turn me away\rI was waiting down at the ancient gate\rYou go\rWherever you go today\rYou go today\rI remember how they took you down\rAs the winter turned the meadow brown\rYou go\rWherever you go today\rYou go today\rWhen I walking brother don't you forget\rIt ain't often you'll ever find a friend\rYou go\rWherever you go today\rYou go today [x8]",
