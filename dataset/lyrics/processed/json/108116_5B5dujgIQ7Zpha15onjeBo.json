  "lyrics": "Their subtle voices on the wind\r\nAsking me the same old things\r\nThey don't wanna be there for the come down\r\nBut they sure do wanna see it\r\nCaught me feeling so damn empty\r\nBut you never will admit it\n\nYou like me better on the outside\n\nSo you don't have to deal with it\n\n\n\nYou're casting stones in my direction\n\nGotta check on what I do\n\nI'm surrounded by glass houses\n\nJust trying to see what I've been through\n\n\n\nJust kick rocks, kick rocks\n\nTil your heart stops beating\n\nChew glass, chew glass\n\nTil your mouth starts bleeding\n\n\n\nI can tell you stories\n\nI can open up my scars\n\nI can tell you why I had to it\n\nHad to fill my head with stars\n\n\n\nYou're casting stones in my direction\n\nGotta check on what I do\n\nI'm surrounded by glass houses\n\nJust trying to see what I've been through\n\n\n\nJust kick rocks, kick rocks\n\nTil your heart stops beating\n\nChew glass, chew glass\n\nTil your mouth starts bleeding\n\n\n\nI am fire, believe me\n\nBut you want me down on my knees\n\nI feel you look down on me\n\nTake it all, take the air that I breathe\n\nI know, I should know better\n\nBut that's when you're under the weather\n\nIt's hard to put it together\n\nIf not now, maybe never\n\n\n\nSo just kick rocks, kick rocks\n\nTil your heart stops beating\n\nChew glass, chew glass\n\nTil your mouth starts bleeding\n\nKick rocks, kick rocks\n\nTil your heart stops beating\n\nChew glass, chew glass\n\nTil your mouth starts bleeding",
