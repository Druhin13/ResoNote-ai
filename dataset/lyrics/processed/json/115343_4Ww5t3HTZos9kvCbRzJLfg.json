  "lyrics": "I blew right past that city limit sign\r\nInto that little town we used to own\r\nThe co-op and the quick stop were all boarded up\r\nAnd those yellow lines faded on the road\r\nMan I swear I can still hear you singing\n\nLike an angel through my Chevy stereo\n\nOh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory\n\nYou're everywhere we used to go\n\n\n\nI still look for your car\n\nI still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown\n\nI'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us\n\nKeeps me up like we're still going down\n\nStill feeling you like you never said goodbye\n\nLike you were mine\n\n\n\nSometimes this tinker back truck\n\nTalks me into burning gas\n\nPast your house\n\nA little south where the gravel runs out\n\nBut it never brings you back\n\n\n\nI still look for your car\n\nI still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown\n\nI'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us\n\nKeeps me up like we're still going down\n\nStill feeling you like you never said goodbye\n\nBaby, like you were mine\n\n\n\nOh yeah, still feels you're mine\n\nMan I swear I can still hear you singing\n\nLike an angel through my Chevy stereo\n\nOh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory\n\nYou're everywhere we used to go\n\n\n\nI still look for your car\n\nI still stop at the bar on the weekend, drinking too much Crown\n\nI'm still chasing the buzz, yeah that used to be us\n\nKeeps me up like we're still going down\n\nStill feeling you like you never said goodbye\n\nBaby, like you were mine\n\nYeah it still feels like you're mine\n\n\n\nMan I swear I can still hear you singing\n\nLike an angel through my Chevy stereo\n\nOh every turn, every street, I drop down a memory\n\nYou're everywhere we used to go",
