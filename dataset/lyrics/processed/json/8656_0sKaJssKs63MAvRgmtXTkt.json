  "lyrics": "I swim in oceans of blue sky\r\nAutumn hazy\r\nThey tell me it's only you\r\nAnticipating the one thing that could save me\r\nBut something's not right with the moon\r\nEvery time I get by I get closer to thinking\n\nAnd we don't need that again\n\nI've been sinking in blue eyed Autumn baby\n\nStill thinking back to when\n\n\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nThought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nThought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nMine in the morning\n\n\n\nI walk the streets out of time\n\nSo tired and lonely\n\nNever to be the same\n\nIt could've been something beautiful if only\n\nI opened my eyes too late\n\nEvery time that I try words get lost in the wind\n\nAnd we don't need that again\n\nI've been thinking of blue eyed Autumn baby\n\nI used to remember when\n\n\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nThought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nThought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nMine in the morning\n\n\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nThought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nMine in the morning\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nMine in the morning\n\n\n\nMine in the morning\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nMine in the morning\n\nI thought she'd be mine\n\nMine in the morning",
