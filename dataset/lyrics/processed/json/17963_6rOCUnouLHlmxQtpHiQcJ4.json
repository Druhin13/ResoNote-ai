  "lyrics": "Call me the spider king, I creep along the night\r\nI weave a web so dense, once caught there is no flight\r\nSo delicate the strands I weave around my victims taut\r\nThe terror suffocates their shattered afterthoughts\r\nI feel their envy, heavy lies the crown\n\n\n\nCall me the spider king, men sharpen blades behind\n\nCaught in the light of greed, the prize infects their minds\n\nThey fly too close to flames of fame and withered vanity\n\nLike moths they're drawn towards the inhumanity\n\n\n\nI hear their envy, heavy lies the crown\n\n\n\nAnd so I send my spies to watch the guilty seethe\n\nDevise a twisted plot and gently pull the strings\n\nI slink along the boulevards, listen to the streets\n\nThe avenues and gutters give me truth to speak\n\n\n\nI hear their envy, heavy lies the crown\n\n\n\nCall me the spider king, these fiends show no respect\n\nTheir blinded loyalties, the balance that I check\n\n\n\nI hear them sharpen knives behind my back\n\nA moment frozen, let them open fire\n\n\n\nSee the hatred that burns through my eyes\n\nAnd remember the pain I'll inflict on you\n\nBefore the dawn\n\nSuffer my vengeance\n\n\n\nSo many cannons have been aimed at me\n\nThey raise the guillotine at full speed\n\nThe bayonets of men they clash and ring\n\nThe battle's ashen strings, it recedes\n\nThe bodies burning in a blaze of heat\n\nThe screams of agony and lost pride\n\nThese men go off to die, for war and countryside\n\n\n\nThe revving engine of the war machine\n\nDraining it as it feeds on the weak\n\nThey try to resurrect the violent seed\n\nInto a hangman's tree of deceit\n\nThe choice made out on the battleground\n\nThrough history resound\n\nThe weight would crush you down\n\n'Cause heavy lies the crown\n\n\n\nI smell the fear these men disguise as their love\n\nThe hints of their betrayal, it fires my blood\n\nSo many knives have missed my back to put me down\n\nThe weight would crush you down\n\n'Cause heavy lies the crown\n\n\n\nDon't put me on a pedestal\n\nI lay there for you all to see\n\nI never wanted any war\n\nSave me from the hate below\n\n\n\nEnvy seeps from every pore\n\nJealousy is your just reward\n\nThis is a warning to you all\n\nDon't ever try to plot my fall\n\nI'll put you six feet in the ground\n\nHeavy lies the crown",
