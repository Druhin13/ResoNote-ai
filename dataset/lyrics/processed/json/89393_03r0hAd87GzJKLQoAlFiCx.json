  "lyrics": "Don't ask me what I think about it, I don't even know\r\nCause my heart's ticking down and the spring's about to go\r\nGot a lot of cloudy feelings on account of what they done\r\nYou got my eyes burning like honey in the sun\r\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\n\n\nI was scratching at the windows of the folks up on the hill\n\nBut I ain't calling down the bright lights anymore, I had my fill\n\nNow the comedy is over, the tragedy is done\n\nYou got my eyes burning like honey in the sun\n\n\n\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\n\n\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\nShine\n\nThey don't shine just for anyone\n\n\n\nShine, shine, shine for anyone\n\nOh shine\n\nShine, shine, shine just for anyone\n\nThey don't shine for anyone\n\nShine, shine, shine for anyone\n\nThey don't shine\n\nShine, shine, shine just for anyone\n\nOh they don't shine\n\nShine, shine, shine for anyone\n\nOh you can make them shine\n\nShine, shine, shine just for anyone\n\nCome on, make them shine\n\nShine, shine, shine for anyone...",
