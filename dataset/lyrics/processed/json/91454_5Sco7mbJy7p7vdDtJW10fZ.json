  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Born For This par The Score\r\nI'm checking my vital signs\nDrawing my battle lines, going to war again\nFeeling the rhythm inside of my chest, all I need is just a pen\nI know I was born for this\nI know I was born for this\n\nDon't care for the critics, my words are like physics:\nA force that they can't stop\nThey just don't get it, I think they forget I'm not\nDone 'til I'm on top\nI know I was born for this\nI know I was born for this\n\n\nI believe, I believe we can write our story\nI believe, I believe we can be an army (Hoo)\n\nWe are the warriors who learned to love the pain\nWe come from different places, but have the same name\n'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were\n'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)\nWe are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame\nWatch as our fire rages; our hearts are never tame\n'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were\n'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)\n\nI've struggled for years and through all the tears\n\nI've faced the doubts I hide\nI never gave into my fears deep within cause\nI heard my voice inside\nI know I was born for this\nI know I was born for this\n\nI will never lose my voice\nIf I cut out all the noise\nI know I was born for this\nI know I was born for this\nI believe, I believe we can write our story\nI'll believe, I'll believe we can be an army (Hoo)\n\nWe are the warriors who learned to love the pain\nWe come from different places, but have the same name\n'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were\n\n'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)\nWe are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame\nWatch as our fire rages; our hearts are never tame\n'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were\n'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)\n\nOh-oh-oh, hoo\nOh-oh-oh, hoo\nOh-oh-oh, hoo\nOh-oh-oh, hoo\nThese words that I write are for someone like me\nTo know you're not alone\nThe moves that you make, yeah, they come up mistakes\nDon't ever lose your hope\n\nJust know that you were born for this\nJust know you were born for this (Hoo)\n\nWe are the warriors who learned to love the pain\nWe come from different places, but have the same name\n'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were\n'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)\nWe are the broken ones who chose to spark a flame\nWatch as our fire rages; our hearts are never tame\n'Cause we were, 'cause we were, 'cause we were\n'Cause we were born for this, we were born for this (Oh-oh-oh, hoo)\n\nWe were born for this, we were born for this",
