  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson This House par Tom MacDonald\r\nLately everyone been talking crazy\nFeel like everybody's got some shit to say\nThey misinterpreted my good intentions\nAnd expected I was just gon' step away\nIf there's a heart to pumps and there's a breath to take\nThen I won't bite my tongue as long as I'm awake\nAnd they don't have the guts to make a dumb mistake\nI'd rather crash the car and never touch the brakes!\n\nI built this fucking house!\nThey the kind of people that be dying for exposure\nThey the kind of people that get mad and lose composure\n\nThey the kind of people that are never going forward\nThey're just the ones, the ones that are looking for apologies\nHating real loud but they follow me\nScreaming at the top of their lungs\nI'm the scum of the Earth\nIn the same damn breath, trying to preach about equality\n\nBack before I wrote the song on race\nThey all ignored that I had something great\nThey tried to edge me out\nThey didn't hear my bars\nThey tried to tell me that I wasn't built for fame\nFast-forward to when I'm fucking paid\nI ain't spent a dollar on no fucking chain\n\nI'll get my mom a house\nI'll get my dad a car\nI'll make my sister rich\nShe'll never work again\n\nAnd this hater shit is so underwhelming\nI'm conditioned for all of the abuse\nSeeing the reaction videos all blowing up\nYou're welcome for all of the views\nBlow up my Twitter, y'all just keep making me bigger\nY'all just keep showing you're triggered\nY'all just keep missing the point that I keep doing me\nY'all ain't nothing to even consider\n\nMan I built this fucking house!\nI'm the kind of person making music with a purpose\n\nYou the kind of people that be hating on the surface\nI'm the kind that you ain't used to\nI'm the kind to make you nervous\nYeah\nBack before I even wrote the record\nI can see this coming like a fortune-teller\nAnd a calm sea don't make a skilled sailor\nSo I thank the heavens for the stormy weather\n\nOkay\nFast-forward to when we're old and gray\nI'll be looking back at when they posted hate\nAnd it would hurt a bit\nBut it was worth it when\nYour dreams is getting heard\nNo matter what they say\nI tried conveying that I love us all\n\nI know the way I did it left them so appalled\nI used a broken arm to try to break their walls\nNo matter what they say they know it took balls\n\nI surveyed the land and I found a location\nUnloaded the lumber and pounded the stakes in\nI blended the bones of the people who hated\nWith blood and cement then I poured the foundation\nI built the frame with all my guilt and shame\nAnd then I chiseled my name and the date in the basement\nI carved my initials in all of the boards and the beams\nThat are needed for structural greatness\n\nNo record label\nNo distribution\n\nNo co-sign\nNo publicists\nNo manager\nNo team-mates\nNo money to make out my budget with\nNo groceries\nNo studio\nNo booking agent\nNo bucket list\nNo PR\nNo marketing\nJust fans\n\nMan we built this fucking house!\nWhen my day's end and it's vacant\nThen they bury me with the only key\nMy biggest fans gonna break in\nWith a Ouija board and box of chalk\n\nDraw a pentagram, hail Satan\nTry to bring me back from that wooden box\nYa'll tried to fill my grave with\n\nThen they'll sit on the roof with the rifles I hid in the fridge\nAnd I'll shoot at the men on the ridge who are coming to undo the work that I did\nThen they'll block-off the highways that leads to the crib\nAnd put sensors on all of the boards on the bridge\nSo they know when they're coming to empty the clip\nThen they'll gut all the bodies and cut off the skin\nThen connect all the pieces with needles and pins\nAnd attach it to 10 feet of branches and twigs\n\nAnd then plant it in mud 'til it stands in the wind\nAnd then stand there and look at the shit that we did\nThat we'd never imagined we'll do 'cause of them\n\nOur blood and sweat and tears went into what we built 'til we were begged\nSo we used blood and sweat and tears of enemies to build our flag\n\nWe built this house\nWe laid these bricks\nWe set these traps\nThese flames we lit\nOur haters doused in gasoline\nThey brought to try and torch us with\n\n\n\"Heh, let them hate dawg\nEveryone will have something to say, dawg\nTheir opinions don't mean shit\nTryin' to judge your engine by your paint job\"\n\nFuck a gravestone, I'ma cheat death\nThere's too much I ain't seen yet\nThey think that I got it way over my head\nBut I feel like I just got my feet wet\n\nWe try to dream more and sleep less\nAvoid the pills when we're de-pressed\nRemember to not be too hard on ourselves\nIf we are cut deep enough we all bleed red\n\nMan you never know when it's time to go\nHeavens open when the bars are closed\nSo seize the moment, don't leave it hopin' you'll breath tomorrow\nYou can be a ghost\n\nI'm living my life\nThe finish lines right in front of me\nMade of fishing wires\nSo I never see it 'till it's too late\nWhen God shakes my hand\nPlease celebrate\nPlease celebrate, please celebrate, please celebrate\nPlease celebrate, please celebrate, please celebrate",
