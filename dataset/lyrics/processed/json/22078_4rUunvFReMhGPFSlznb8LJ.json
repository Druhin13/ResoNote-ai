  "lyrics": "I woke up Sunday morning\r\nAnother twenty years gone by\r\nPulled myself out of my bed\r\nIt's getting harder every time\r\nGrabbed my phone but there's no messages at all\n\nThen I realized there's no one left to call\n\n\n\nWoah woah\n\nSeems like things ain't what they used to be\n\nWoah woah\n\nCan't cry anymore\n\nI'm alone\n\nWoah woah\n\nWhere did everyone go?\n\n\n\nI try to walk every morning\n\nAnd no one looks me in the eye\n\nIt feels like love just left the world\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder why\n\n\n\nI have that dream again where I begin to fall\n\nAnd on the way down like the meaning of it all\n\n\n\nWoah woah\n\nNo things ain't what they used to be\n\nWoah woah\n\nCan't cry anymore\n\nI'm alone\n\nWoah woah\n\nWhere did everyone go?\n\n\n\nI fell asleep last night and woke up in the fall\n\nTurned my head and blinked and now there stands a wall\n\n\n\nWoah woah\n\nSeems like things ain't what they used to be\n\nWoah woah\n\nI can't cry anymore\n\nI'm alone\n\nWoah woah\n\nWhere did everyone go?\n\nWoah woah\n\nWhere did everyone go?",
