  "lyrics": "And I willed that my motives would be changing\r\nBut the pull from my pain has got me straining\r\nAnd the way that you’re moving’s got me waiting\r\nFor a chance to come over and explain it\r\nEverything is blurry now\n\nI could get you on your back and lay it down yeah\n\nIn my head it’s too damn loud\n\nI just wanna hear your girl and you scream out, yeah\n\n\n\nThis isn’t who I want to be\n\nBlaming all my bad decisions on GAD, but\n\nSixty minutes of ecstasy\n\nIs my only substitution for finding peace\n\n\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\n\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\n\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\n\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\nAnd the sea grows\n\n\n\n(and the sea grows\n\nAnd the sea grows)\n\n\n\n(and the sea grows\n\nAnd the sea grows)\n\n\n\nFunny how I always thought that i knew ya\n\nOnly love me when i screw up\n\nIf i’m high we could chill tho\n\nAvoid problems that are real\n\nOh girl\n\nWhen you mess with me\n\nYeah\n\nYou make a mess that we don’t\n\nHave time to go deal with\n\nYou’re just fun\n\nAnd i have a mental illness\n\nBut\n\n\n\nWe live\n\nWe learn\n\nWe love\n\n\n\nIt’s the beginning for us\n\nIt’s the beginning for us\n\n\n\nYeah...\n\n\n\nAnd the sea grows",
