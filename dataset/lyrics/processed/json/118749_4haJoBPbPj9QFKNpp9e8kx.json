  "lyrics": "Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em\r\nAll that peace and that unity\r\nAll that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah\r\n'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down\r\nOpinions over statistics, of course\r\nGassed off journalistic\n\nCome at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report\n\nBooked a private room at Wylie's, waiter twistin' the cork\n\nI got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course\n\nAt award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course\n\nGirls huggin' me then askin' me, \"What scent that is, boy?\"\n\nI be walkin' around the Six, like I invented it, boy\n\nYeah, who am I? The do or die, the one with the fewest lies\n\nAnd the truest ties, they try to compare us but\n\nLike a job straight out of high school\n\nThere's no you and I\n\nI taught you everything you know, now you got student pride\n\nAll factual\n\nI call the house, the embassy\n\nThe studio, the chapel, I hate to travel\n\nI just pulled up on Solana show, the girl's a natural\n\nI knew her way back when Hollywood was international\n\nYeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends\n\nWord to the flags that belong in the hood of my 'Benz\n\nVery presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential\n\nI broke spirits that I never meant to\n\nMy body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine\n\nAnd sleep at the opposite times\n\nPromise shit is gettin' out of line, like when you make a stencil\n\nOr getting out of line, like when you break a pencil\n\nViolatin' the Treaty of Versailles, champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I\n\nI refuse to comply with regulations, I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence\n\nLike Sanders on the Detroit Lions\n\nGet a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find you\n\nMotor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license\n\nThey tell me \"don't worry, I got your money\" like Osirus\n\n(I'm the Osiris of this shit)\n\nDirty 30, workin' on me\n\nTired of women that may tag me in pictures, airin' my dirty laundry\n\nCaterin' is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite\n\nShit is nice, but I prefer Madeo\n\nCalamari rings and tomato\n\nI got the sauce and now shorty's keep claimin' \"prego\"\n\nWaking up at 6 PM like \"where does the day go?\"\n\nForecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables\n\n2010 was when I lost my halo\n\n2017 I lost a J. Lo\n\nA Rotterdam trip had me on front page, though\n\nI had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes\n\nClosed off but I could never stay closed\n\nBillboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños\n\nBlack excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it’s not the same though\n\nAll goodie, that just pushed me to do the things we all couldn’t\n\nNiggas stakin' out the crib, it’s all gravy\n\nProtection that God gave me\n\nShit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies\n\nI gotta watch who I’m talkin' to like it’s all agents\n\nI’ve seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers\n\nKnowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here\n\nCover my ears, my security government tier\n\nYeah, advance the venue so we know the exits\n\nCheck the guest list, if opps make an appearance at least it’s expected\n\nTell ‘em I don’t want to link like a broken necklace\n\nI’ll be in better company with my own reflection\n\nMirror, mirror, on the ceilin' of my suite in the Royal Palace\n\nThe TV playin' Al Jazeera\n\nInshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer\n\nWhenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira\n\n\n\nI love, I love\n\nI love, I love it\n\nBaby, I",
