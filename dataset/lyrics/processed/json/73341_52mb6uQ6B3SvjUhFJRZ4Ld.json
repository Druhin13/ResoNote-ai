  "lyrics": "Ever since I was a kid\r\nI remember having dreams of grandeur\r\nI was gonna be someone, I know what I want\r\nEverybody played second best\r\nAnd I held you back just like all the rest\n\nI think I got what I want\n\n\n\nEverybody's got to fight their demons\n\nAnd you know I had to fight mine, too\n\nIt took a lot out of me, it took a lot out of you\n\n\n\nTo be living in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can wake you\n\nLiving oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can shock you, too\n\n\n\nAll the money that I spend on you\n\nDoesn't mean a thing if the love's not true\n\nBaby please, I'll get what you want\n\n\n\nCan't you tell me you and me ain't lost\n\nI know what I did, I know what it cost\n\nNow I'm yours and I've got what you want\n\n\n\nAll the fightin' will have been for nothin'\n\nIf at the end I can't have you\n\nI'll throw it all away if that's what you want me to do\n\n\n\nLiving in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can wake you\n\nLiving in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can shake you, too\n\n\n\nFunny how desire can burn you up inside\n\nAnd make you commit emotional suicide\n\nEverybody's got the desire to leave their mark\n\nSome just do it over a trail of broken hearts\n\n\n\nAnd all the people that protect and serve\n\nwould disappear if the well dried up\n\nI'm thirsty for affection\n\nLet me drink from your loving cup\n\n\n\nLiving in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can shock you\n\nLiving in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can rock you\n\nLiving in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can shake you\n\nLiving in oz, living in oz\n\nSometimes the dream can wake you, too",
