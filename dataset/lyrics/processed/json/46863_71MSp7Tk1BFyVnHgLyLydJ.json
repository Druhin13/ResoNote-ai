  "lyrics": "I was just a young boy \nElvis Presley was the king \nHe had the money, the girl and the stretch limousine \nThere was drums and guitars \nThen the beatles and stones \nAnd a million girls never left them alone\n\n\n\nTraded my soul for rock and roll \n\nI made a deal with the Devil \n\nFortune and fame, fire and flames \n\nI made a deal with the Devil\n\n\n\nTeased by the fruit and lead to temptation \n\nIt was my school boy dream \n\nI had to rock the nation \n\nI got an electric guitar and joined a rock and roll band \n\nOn a world wide tour of the promise land \n\nParty all night, sleep all day \n\nIn a rock and roll heaven there's a hell to pay\n\n\n\nTraded my soul for rock and roll \n\nI made a deal with the Devil \n\nFortune and fame, fire and flames \n\nI made a deal with the Devil \n\nLiving in sin, let the party begin' \n\nI made a deal with the Devil\n\n\n\nCome on, let's go, it's a rock and roll show \n\nRed hot flames will light the sky \n\nThese immortal souls we will walk on hot coals \n\nIn a land were you live and never die\n\n\n\n(solo)\n\n\n\nCome on girl, just follow me \n\nI'm gonna take you down, down, down\n\nTraded my soul for rock and roll \n\nI made a deal with the Devil \n\nFortune and fame, fire and flames \n\nI made a deal with the Devil\n\nBottles of booze and girls with tattoos \n\nI made a deal with the Devil \n\nSex and guitars just to be a rock star \n\nI made a deal with the Devil !",
