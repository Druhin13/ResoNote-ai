  "lyrics": "Sammy and Katie went a little too far\r\nIn a Johnson grass out behind the barn\r\nNow he ain't got the money for gas\r\nOr a ticket out West\r\nThere's gonna a finger on the trigger when her daddy finds out\n\nHis baby ain't been eating but she's putting on pounds\n\nShotgun wedding and a boy in a bulletproof vest\n\n\n\nIs he gonna run\n\nIs he gonna stay\n\nWill he say I do, or I don't\n\nIt's hard to say, but either way\n\nIt's a day this whole town won't forget\n\nShotgun wedding and a boy in a bulletproof vest\n\n\n\nAunt Betty on the organ, here comes the bride\n\nWith her half hammered daddy and his evil eye\n\nUnc' Sammy at the altar, sweating in his camouflage vest\n\n\n\nPreacher man looking like he just saw a ghost\n\nDaddy's sawed off sticking out from under his coat\n\nShotgun wedding and a boy in a bulletproof vest\n\n\n\nIs he gonna run\n\nIs he gonna stay\n\nWill he say I do, or I don't\n\nIt's hard to say, but either way\n\nIt's a day this whole town won't forget\n\nShotgun wedding and a boy in a bulletproof vest\n\n\n\nPreacher says bow your head and thank the Lord\n\nOh Sammy sees a break and bolts through the door\n\nLooks like that vest will be put to the test\n\n\n\nYeah buckshot buzzing all around his head\n\nIt's a wonder that boy ain't never been dead\n\nI guess he just ain't ready yet\n\n\n\nLook at him run\n\nHe ain't gonna stay\n\nWon't say I do\n\n'Cause he know there ain't no way\n\nIt's the day this whole town won't forget\n\nShotgun wedding and a boy in a bulletproof vest\n\n\n\nAw, look at him run\n\nHe done passed up the buckshot\n\nHe's gone daddy\n\nTook the stop sign with him",
