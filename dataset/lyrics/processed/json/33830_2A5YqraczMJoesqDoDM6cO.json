  "lyrics": "Infinitely caught in a weave of, \nTryna dip around what they breed before you leave or, \nClimbing in and out of a scene they call elite or, \nLining up whoever's between the world and me or, \nMe and the world, whichever first when pronouncing it, \nTaught us \"get enough for us all if you come out with it\", \n\nThe background eat till it's gone if you all around with it, \n\nTryna get a piece off the corner like quarter ouncing it, \n\nCaught up in the bounce of it, where loyalty is all that it oughta’ be\n\nLike if I was to call and see if you down for it, \n\nWord to a dresser drawer burying what was found in it, \n\nTruly forever yours ever more if you doubted it, \n\nEver more like more than you was ever surrounded with, \n\nTo get involved makes you apart of the sound of it, \n\nNo regret at the door and no announcing it, \n\nFucking with whatever you about with it \n\n\n\nForever in a day, forever in a day, \n\n100 on the line, and never will it stray, \n\n100 on the line, and never will it stray, \n\n100 on the line, however we should aim\n\nForever in a day\n\n\n\nForever ever, forever ever, \n\nWith short change measures, in all day leathers, \n\nAnd honor's like forever ever, forever ever, \n\nYour alibi know to keep it Andre clever, \n\nAnd being on mean we ignored what all they left us, \n\nAnd it starts out being as on as Rae Sremmurd, \n\nBare minimum, the feeling of ceilings that never left us, \n\nBut the chicken box will kick off the top for whatever weather, \n\nFor the win of it, corner get loud, they caught wind of it, \n\nAnd everybody caught in the sound that you was whispering, \n\nSend something flying around to help them get in it, \n\nOr how that's still yours if your name ain't on the end of it, \n\nLoyalty is priceless, jewelry isn't, \n\nGive or take, depending on what type of jewelry you're given, \n\nIn a space, where the script is stuck to like a pivot, \n\nIf you knew us then you knew we was with it when it’s \n\nForever in a day \n\n\n\nForever in a day, forever in a day, \n\n100 on the line, and never will it stray, \n\n100 on the line, and never will it stray, \n\n100 on the line, however we should aim\n\nForever in a day\n\n\n\nBroad day like jumping out in the way \n\nWhen one is jumping up outta the front and finding it's aim, \n\nOr, divying a bag with who you're beside every day \n\nAnd splitting points like you dotted your name, \n\n'cause know that all of these green lives that used to be here, \n\nMatter like these black lives that these blue lives shoot outta fear, \n\nSo all these green lives used over here, \n\nWas 'posed to set it where never would a second set of shooters appear, \n\nThe first set is just the usual here, \n\nIt makes sense as much as it kinda don't but that's new to who, where?, \n\nThe prestige, of feeling like you're who they let breathe, \n\nDue to abag that you shouldn't have, it just seems, \n\nLike more than they’re letting on to, \n\nFinger fucking money resorts to thinking that it adores you, \n\nWhatever you make of it, make it where it goes around with you, \n\nIn light of where all these go arounds put you, forever in a day",
