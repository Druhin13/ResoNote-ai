  "lyrics": "Those who came to see a train wreck, need to get their brain checked\r\nHaving thoughts of toasting me up in the champagne Lex\r\nI would entertain if it were a thing\r\nBut I'm the heir to the throne\r\nStrong enough to knock the crown off the current King\r\nCuz every bar is epic\n\nAs far as skeptics, it can bring an insomniac out a narcoleptic\n\nI kill whoever crave drama with a thirst for trouble\n\nYea, my pen is poppin, didn't mean to burst your bubble\n\nOff a rich block",
