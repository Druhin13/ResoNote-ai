  "lyrics": "I was never clear before, I lost myself and you were weak\r\nSorry but I must inform the others on intentions that you seek\r\nHow do I choose a side?\r\nI'm just trying, I'm just fighting to say\r\nI'm alive\n\nI'm alive\n\nAnd not just breathing\n\n\n\nShe only cares about the way she looks\n\nCan't think for herself she's just a frame\n\nA body dwelling on this earth\n\nA user of the desperate and the vain\n\nMaybe there's someone out there\n\nWho's good with speaking to a blank stare\n\nI know I'm preaching to a lost cause but at least I know\n\n\n\nI'm alive\n\nI'm alive\n\nAnd not just breathing\n\n\n\nStay away from me\n\nStay away from me\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid to speak my mind and throw this life away\n\nI've been enslaved, and years of wasting time made me this way\n\nNo it won't get better, we'll just drift apart\n\nAnd when you do start trying I hope you're reminded\n\n\n\nI'm alive\n\nI'm alive\n\nAnd not just breathing\n\n\n\nTime will tell but I wait patiently\n\nThere's not a single string attached to you that I can't see\n\nIt's like the longer I wait the more you disintegrate\n\nThere's not a moment I don't hope for you but I can't wait\n\n\n\nTime will tell but I wait patiently\n\nThere's not a single string attached to you that I can't see\n\nIt's like the longer I wait the more you disintegrate\n\nThere's not a moment I don't hope for you but I can't wait\n\n\n\nStay away from me\n\nStay away from me\n\n\n\nI'm alive\n\nI'm alive\n\nAnd not just breathing",
