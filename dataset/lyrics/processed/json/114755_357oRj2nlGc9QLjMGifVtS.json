  "lyrics": "I ain't lonely, but I spend a lot of time alone\r\nMore than I'd like to, but I'm okay with staying home\r\nMy, how the last few months have changed!\r\nIâ€™m smilin' more despite the pain\r\nI breathe in, I breathe out\n\nGot friends to call who let me talk about\n\nWhat ain't working, what's still hurtin'\n\nAll the things I feel like cussing out\n\nNow and then I let it go\n\nI ride the waves I can't control\n\nI'm learning how to build a better boat\n\n\n\nI hate waiting, ain't no patience in these hands\n\nI'm not complaining, sometimes it's hard to change a man\n\nI think I'm stronger than I was, I let God do what he does\n\n\n\nI breathe in, I breathe out\n\nGot friends to call who let me talk about\n\nWhat ain't working, what's still hurtin'\n\nAll the things I feel like cussing out\n\nNow and then I let it go\n\nI ride the waves I can't control\n\nI'm learning how to build a better boat\n\n\n\nI breathe in, I breathe out\n\nGot friends to call who let me talk about\n\nWhat ain't working, what's still hurtin'\n\nAll the things I feel like cussing out\n\nNow and then I let it go\n\nI ride the waves I can't control\n\nIf it's working I don't know\n\nWhen I get done the thing may not float\n\nBut I'm learning how to build a better boat",
