  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Girlfriend par Bea Miller\r\nI don't wanna be your girlfriend\n\nI just wanna play with your hair\nWhen we get up in the morning\nI'll be better on my own, I swear\n\nSmoking in bed\nSleeping like the weekend\nAnd you're in the kitchen\nWhy the fuck is you cleaning?\n'Cause you're not my man\nDon't get too comfortable in my skin, ooh\nI told you before\nIt's not what I'm into\nI'm trying to be clear\nI'm not sending mixed signals\n\nSo why you still here?\nDon't you got somewhere to be? Ooh\n\nI'm not a party or plan\nI don't need your love\nI'm not a stranger to your touch\nBut it's not enough\nMaybe honesty is missing here?\nBut our bodies say it easier\n\nI just wanna play with your hair\nWhen we get up in the morning\nI'll be better on my own, I swear, ooh\n\nI don't wanna be your girlfriend\nI just wanna play with your hair\nI prefer to tell the truth\nBut I'm not brave enough to lose what's already there\n\n\nYou text me all day\nYeah, I get the message\nNah uh, I can't hang\nWhy you get so defensive?\nAnd nothing's gon' change\nDon't get your hopes up about me, no, no\nAt the same time, when I get lonely\nDrop everything, when you see that I'm calling\n\n'Cause just for the night\nI'll be what you want me to be, yeah\n\nI'm not a party or plan\nI don't need your love (I don't need it)\n\nI'm not a stranger to your touch\nBut it's not enough (it's not enough)\n\nMaybe honesty is missing here?\nBut our bodies say it easier\n\nI don't wanna be your girlfriend\nI just wanna play with your hair\nWhen we get up in the morning\nI'll be better on my own, I swear, ooh ooh\nI don't wanna be your girlfriend\nI just wanna play with your hair\nI prefer to tell the truth\nBut I'm not brave enough to lose what's already there",
