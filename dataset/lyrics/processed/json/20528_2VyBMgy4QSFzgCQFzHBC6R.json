  "lyrics": "The sun is up i'm off the river now\r\nI sit beneath the morning sun\r\nGone away, washed away i watch the clouds roll by\r\nThere i sit and i close my eyes\r\nThinking oh my it's good life\r\nThe clouds roll in the night begins\r\nThe stars they come and go\r\nA crisp cool air comes creeping in\r\nThere alone i sit think of all the times i miss\r\nOh i think of my lover's kiss\r\nThinking oh my it's good life\r\nGone away and goodbye\r\nHello faith and goodbye haste\r\nSettle down like a good rain coming down on me\r\nComing down on me\r\nOh\r\nWindows down we drive around hitting eighty-five\r\nI don't turn left and don't right\r\nHeaven knows i try just to leave it all behind\r\nAnd oh i think of the love that i'll find\r\nThinking oh my\r\nGone away and goodbye\r\nHello faith and goodbye haste\r\nSettle down like a good rain coming down on me\r\nComing downn on me\r\nIt's a good life",
