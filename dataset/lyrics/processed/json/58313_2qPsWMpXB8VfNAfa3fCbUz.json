  "lyrics": "Well come gather round children it's time that you heard\r\nThe devil is after and how you're concerned how it'shard for the living on the edge of a knife\r\nWe you take your shot you won't be swinging twice\r\nWell come hell high water and we ain't got nothing\r\nIn one hand's a bottle in the other there ain't one\n\nOh it's hard for the living so you put out both your eyes\n\nBut it's two for the both man and you will not pass him twice\n\n\n\nNow it's not what your saying, and it's not what you said\n\nIt's how you been living, not a life but not quite dead\n\nWell it's hard for the living, at least it is for most\n\nBut it's for fear of judgement you cry Father, Son and Holy Ghost",
