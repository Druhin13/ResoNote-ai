  "lyrics": "You said if you could fly\r\nYou would fly far - far into the sky\r\nSo all you'd ever know\r\nIs the blue - that blue sky up above?\r\nYou've yet to learn what the pain from true sadness is like\n\nYou've only had but a taste\n\nBut you're a moth to the flame\n\nWhen all my feelings reach you\n\nThey'll no longer be mute\n\nFor on that day\n\nThey'll live in spoken words\n\n\n\nFrom in a dream\n\nWhen you awake into the world\n\nYou no longer know\n\nIf you could only spread your wings and fly away\n\n\n\nYou said if you could fly\n\nYou would fly far - far into the sky\n\nAnd you would set your aim\n\nOn the clouds all around that endless sky\n\nThe moment you break free\n\nYou'll finally find - find all you seek\n\nAnd it's all waiting there\n\nIn that blue - in that blue sky up above\n\nIn that blue - in that blue sky up above\n\nIn that blue - in that blue sky up above\n\n\n\nWith a sound like the storm\n\nTurning bitter and dark\n\nThat window shut in your heart\n\nIt shatters, falling apart\n\nAnd so at last, you escape\n\nFrom your cold, broken cage\n\nSo break away without ever looking back\n\n\n\nThere is a chase inside my chest\n\nWhere my heart beats quick cause my breath\n\nAnd so I kick the window in and fly away!\n\n\n\nYou said if you could fly\n\nYou'd fly and nothing would stop you\n\nYou're tempted by that voice\n\nThat's so far - so far from where you are\n\nI'll take your eager hand\n\nAnd take you far - far away with me\n\nSo you could see my world\n\nIt's the blue - that blue sky up above\n\n\n\nHey, it's okay to fail\n\nYeah, it's okay to fall\n\nWhat really counts - what only counts\n\nIs if you pull yourself back up!\n\n\n\nYou said if you could fly\n\nYou would fly far - far into the sky\n\nAnd you would set your aim\n\nOn the clouds all around that endless sky\n\nThe moment you break free\n\nYou'll finally find - find all you seek\n\nAnd it's all waiting there\n\nIn that blue - in that blue sky up above\n\nIn that blue - in that blue sky up above\n\nIn that blue - in that blue sky up above",
