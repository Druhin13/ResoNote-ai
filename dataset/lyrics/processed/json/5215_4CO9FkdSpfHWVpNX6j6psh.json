  "lyrics": "Do you remember\r\nWhen you looked in the water and saw your reflection\r\nThe embers\r\nThey drew out a map and they showed you direction\r\nYour sender\r\nIs far in the east where your heart is at peace\n\nWhen you enter\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\n\n\nHelp me recall that first morning\n\nSunlight adorning\n\nCracks on the floor well it served as a warning\n\nEverything's changing\n\nAll re-arranging\n\nFelt so familiar\n\nSo amazing\n\nHopped in the car\n\nDrove to the mountains\n\nCows in the street\n\nPrayer beads you were counting\n\nThere was the river\n\nEternal Giver\n\nFlowing forever\n\nRemember find your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\n\n\nWhen you've lost your way\n\nColors start to fade\n\nTake a look within\n\nFind your offering\n\nHold it to the sun\n\nLet your spirit run\n\nRemember\n\nRemember find your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nMy love it's just a reminder\n\nFind your center\n\nMy love it's just a reminder",
