  "lyrics": "Fear, fear drowns the mind\r\nIn my kingdom, in my refuge\r\nWithin this empty room\r\nWhere I can speak to you\r\nA last breath for the earthly\n\nIn empty space\n\nDistant voices chant softly\n\nIt's beginning to look like\n\nA pale facade\n\nAnother cry for existence\n\nStands to be ignored\n\nBut it's a pale facade\n\n\n\nIt's a pale facade\n\nHands stretching toward the last day\n\nBeneath the sun\n\nReaching paradox, in time we will\n\nUnmake ourselves\n\nIt's a pale facade\n\nSecure in your right to remain\n\nBreathing the air you did not earn\n\nLike ants coveting\n\n\n\nStrong sense of dependence\n\nNo will of its own\n\nWalk for centuries to realize all that's left is a fading image\n\nWords like fleeting omniscience\n\nCloaked in subtle pain\n\nNo answer for those needing relief from existence\n\n\n\nOh the sight\n\nOh can it be?\n\nI've longed to see that which truly\n\n\n\nOwns the light\n\nA calming wave of incandescent grace\n\n\n\nSpreads its rot\n\n\n\nIt's a pale facade\n\nHands stretching toward the last day beneath the sun\n\nReaching paradox, in time we will unmake ourselves\n\nIt's a pale facade\n\nSecure in your right to remain\n\nBreathing the air you did not earn\n\n\n\nWhen the sun doesn't rise\n\nAnd the hope of light fades\n\nRest these eyes a while\n\nI'll see your face",
