  "lyrics": "She cooks in a fever while I write out my sickness\r\nWhen we’re both done we make love and then we go to bed\r\nOh, tomorrow it all starts over again\r\nEvery day’s tomorrow\r\nShe’s heading off to work, she leaves me with one sleepy kiss\r\nNow I’m all alone in my girlfriend’s clean apartment\n\nFuck it up all day with beer cans and dirty dishes\n\nClean it up before she gets home\n\nClean it up before she gets home\n\n\n\nI don’t have a job and I’m always gone on tour, yeah\n\nI don’t even have a place of my own anymore\n\nI’ve been eatin' Taco Bell and sleeping on the floor\n\nI’ll be hungover for weeks when I turn up at her door\n\nBut she lets me in to stay, yeah\n\nLets me in to stay\n\nShe’s the one part of my life that don’t change\n\nLets me in to stay, says, \"i missed you yesterday\"\n\nI said, \"Baby i ain't going nowhere\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow\"\n\n\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow\n\nLike every day's tomorrow\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow\n\nLike every day's tomorrow\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow\n\nLike every day's tomorrow\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow\n\nLike every day's tomorrow\n\nLet's live like every day's tomorrow",
