  "lyrics": "He puts his hand inside of hers\r\nHe turns her over slowly, taking in the scent\r\nOf her hair, as her breath rests upon his neck\r\nFeeling the weight of her flesh upon his chest\r\nHer blood in mine\n\nRunning through my veins like a real live wire\n\nI don't know why I cannot let this go\n\n\n\nIt's building up inside of me\n\nOver and over and over and over\n\nTwo bodies moving in sync\n\nI turn it over and over and over and over\n\nLike an animal\n\nLike an animal\n\n\n\nIt boils over in my mind\n\nThe heat from underneath the sheets pours out his eye\n\nThat feeling, the burning with every kiss upon her skin\n\nAs her hands, they reach for every inch of him\n\n\n\nFeeling my fire\n\nRunning through my veins like a high desire\n\nI don't know why I cannot let this go\n\n\n\nIt's building up inside of me\n\nOver and over and over and over\n\nTwo bodies moving in sync\n\nI turn it over and over and over and over\n\nLike an animal\n\nLike an animal\n\n\n\nHer blood in mine\n\nRunning through my veins like a real live wire\n\nI don't know why\n\nLike an animal\n\nAn animal",
