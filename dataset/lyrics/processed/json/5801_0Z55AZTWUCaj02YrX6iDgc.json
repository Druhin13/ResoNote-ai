  "lyrics": "She does this thing with her eyes sometimes\r\nJust to let me know that she's doing alright\r\nI can't wait for the morning\r\nTo sit down and go through things\r\n'Cause you know just what to say, don't you now?\n\nAnd don't ask me again\n\nI don't care if we see my friend\n\nDon't ask me again\n\nI'll walk all day with you\n\n\n\nAnd I'll always remember\n\nWhen you fell in the water\n\nI think I will 'til the very end\n\nAnd I'll always remember\n\nWe sat out in bad weather\n\n'Cause you know just what to say, don't you now?\n\n\n\nAnd don't ask me again\n\nI don't care if we see my friend\n\nDon't ask me again\n\nI'll walk all day with you\n\n\n\nAnd don't you ever think you need to drink\n\nAnd don't you ever question it either\n\n'Cause I'm so proud I get to call you mum\n\nI just want to say thank you, just thank you",
