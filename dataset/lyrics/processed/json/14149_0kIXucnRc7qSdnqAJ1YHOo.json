  "lyrics": "Sometimes when I get down\r\nI really like to get down low\r\nI sink my feet into the ground\r\nI dig a great big hole\r\nAnd I've been thinking lately\r\nAbout letting go\n\n'Cause nothing good comes from\n\nSoaked in self-loathe\n\n\n\nBut now I feel pretty lost\n\nA day when I'm at my worst\n\nSo if there's anything that I can do for you\n\nWell, honey pick up the phone\n\n\n\nYou can call me, baby\n\nWhen you feel like that\n\nCall me, call me, call me, you will call me\n\nYou know I'll get right back\n\nYou can call me, baby\n\nWhen you feel like that\n\nCall me, call me, call me, you will call me\n\nYou know I'll get right back\n\n\n\nSometimes when it gets rough\n\nI feel like giving up\n\nI feel like I'm not tough enough\n\nTo face the real stuff\n\nBut I've been getting through it\n\nTake a look at where I'm at\n\nEverything happens for a reason\n\nWhat doesn't kill you don't kill ya\n\n\n\nBut now I feel pretty lost\n\nA day when I'm at my worst\n\nSo if there's anything that I can do for you\n\nWell, honey pick up the phone\n\n\n\nYou can call me, baby\n\nWhen you feel like that\n\nCall me, call me, call me, you will call me\n\nYou know I'll get right back\n\nYou can call me, baby\n\nWhen you feel like that\n\nCall me, call me, call me, you will call me\n\nYou know I'll get right back\n\n\n\nYou're the one, with the sun\n\nFeel the power and lift me up\n\nYou're the one, with the sun\n\nFeel the power and lift me up\n\nYou're the one, with the sun\n\nFeel the power and lift me up\n\nYou're the one, with the sun\n\nFeel the power and lift me up\n\n\n\nYou can call me, baby\n\nWhen you feel like that\n\nCall me, call me, call me, you will call me\n\nYou know I'll get right back\n\nYou can call me, baby\n\nWhen you feel like that\n\nCall me, call me, call me, you will call me\n\nYou know I'll get right back",
