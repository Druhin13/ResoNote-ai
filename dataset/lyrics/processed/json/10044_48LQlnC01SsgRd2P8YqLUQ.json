  "lyrics": "Panic comes in waves\r\nLetters written every day\r\nJealousy's an awful\r\nLet her find her way to you\r\nCan I call you?\n\nCan I call you?\n\n\n\nPanic comes in waves, they say Yes, and I believe it too\n\nLetters written every day They never bring the word of truth\n\nJealousy's an awful thing It's easier than sitting still\n\nLet her find her way to you I can't be sure she ever will\n\n\n\nCan I call you? How's the weather been?\n\nCan I call you? Hold and keep you warm\n\nCan I call you? When are you home again\n\nCan I call you? Don't you remember?\n\nCan I call you? Things are going well\n\nCan I call you? You sound happy\n\nCan I call you? What are you drinking?\n\nCan I call you? Who's the ??\n\n\n\nTry to spend some time alone It seems that's all I ever do\n\nLearn to love your solitude I just don't know what that means\n\nYou gotta push her to the edge no-ooh!\n\nShe's your lover, she's your friend She's my lover, she's my friend\n\n\n\nCan I call you? How's the weather been?\n\nCan I call you? Hold and keep you warm\n\nCan I call you? When are you home again\n\nCan I call you? Don't you remember?\n\nCan I call you? Things are going well\n\nCan I call you? You sound happy\n\nCan I call you? She's my lover, she's my friend\n\nCan I call you? She's my lover, she's my friend",
