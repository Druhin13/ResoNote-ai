  "lyrics": "Square bales, flatbeds\r\nClothesline sunsets\r\nSky blue, barn red\r\nWind chimes, front porch\r\nGood dogs, wood floors\r\nWork boots, open doors\n\n\n\nAnd miles and miles of John Deere green\n\nFreedom far as I can see\n\nA road to run and room to breathe\n\nThat's who I am and I'll always be...\n\n\n\nCaught up in the country\n\nThe only way I wanna be\n\nSomewhere where the road ends\n\nOut there where the creek bends\n\nThat's where you can find me\n\n\n\nWith them fields of gold and cotton rows\n\nThat never ending sky\n\nI take it slow and easy roaming this life\n\nCaught up in the country\n\n\n\nJust look at 'em stars\n\nMust be a billion of 'em\n\nJust doing they thing\n\nRight where God put 'em\n\n\n\nIf this ain't heaven it's halfway there\n\nYou can feel it in the air\n\n\n\nCaught up in the country\n\nThe only way I wanna be\n\nSomewhere where the road ends\n\nOut there where the creek bends\n\nThat's where you can find me\n\n\n\nWith them fields of gold and cotton rows\n\nThat never ending sky\n\nI take it slow and easy roaming this life\n\nCaught up in the country (I was brought up in it)\n\nCaught up in the country (Oh and good Lord willin')\n\n(Yes I am my way, I'll stay...)\n\n(Caught up in it, caught up in it)\n\n\n\nSomewhere where the road ends\n\nOut there where the creek bends\n\nThat's where you can find me\n\n\n\nWith them fields of gold and cotton rows\n\nThat never ending sky\n\nI take it slow and easy roaming this life\n\n\n\nMiles and miles of John Deere green\n\nFreedom far as I can see\n\nA road to run and room to breathe\n\nThat's who I am and I'll always be...\n\n\n\nCaught up in the country\n\nCaught up in the country\n\nCaught up in the country",
