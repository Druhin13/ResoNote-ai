  "lyrics": "Well I started out down a dirty road\r\nStarted out all alone\r\nAnd the sun went down as I crossed the hill\r\nAnd the town lit up, the world got stil\r\nI'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings\n\nComing down is the hardest thing\n\n\n\nWell the good ol' days may not return\n\nAnd the rocks might melt and the sea may burn\n\n\n\nI'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings\n\nComing down is the hardest thing\n\n\n\nWell some say life will beat you down\n\nBreak your heart, steal your crown\n\nSo I've started out for God knows where\n\nI guess I'll know when I get there\n\n\n\nI'm learning to fly, around the clouds\n\nBut what goes up must come down\n\n\n\nI'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings\n\nComing down is the hardest thing",
