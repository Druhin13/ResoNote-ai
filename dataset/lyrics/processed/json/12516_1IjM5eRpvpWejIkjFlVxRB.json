I'm keeping it in\r\nCause my feelings got me trigger-happy watch her grab me\r\nThrow me on the bed and tag me, people laughing\r\nWe don't care, they never happy. Say it nasty\r\nSay it how you want it when those fake people dab me\r\nWatch your back cause they always act'n\r\nBut if you focus in the moment, you could hold it\r\nBut you don't cause you post it. Feeling weird cause of bullshit\r\nSpilling tears cause you're choking\r\nI've been a bad man in the past and now\r\nI'm rapping like its back then but I'm trapped in future actions\r\nTrying to hack them\r\nYou can't cause the plans that you make never happen\r\nCan I push it back on you?\r\nYou you, you you, you you, you you?\r\nI got my feelings back on too\r\nTo you, to you, to you, to you\r\nHope my situation come thru.\r\nThrough you, through you, through you, through you\r\nHope my situation come true.\r\nTrue you, true you, true you, true you",
