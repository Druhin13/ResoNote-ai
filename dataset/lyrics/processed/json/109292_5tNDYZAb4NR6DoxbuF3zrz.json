  "lyrics": "Everyone stares when you walk in the room\r\nThey stare when you go\r\nYou've got so much control\r\nHow could anyone say no?\r\nThey rarely do\r\nThat's why you're you\n\nAnd why you're winning\n\n\n\nAnd I don't even miss you at all\n\nNo, no\n\n\n\nCaught in the light, you would idly spin\n\nYour skeleton ring\n\nSee it shine when you sing\n\nTo the window with no meaning\n\nFrom Tennessee your harmony\n\nWould leave your spirit\n\n\n\nAnd I don't even miss you at all\n\nNo, no\n\n\n\nSilver the shores of isles up north\n\nBoulevards of dancing boats\n\n\n\nYou keep the old ember burning\n\nWith meadows in mind\n\nAs the coaches go by\n\nThese thoughts of you will die\n\nThey rarely do\n\nThat's why you're you\n\nAnd why you're winning\n\n\n\nAnd I don't even miss you at all\n\nNo, no\n\n\n\nSilver the shores of isles up north\n\nBoulevards of dancing boats\n\n\n\nSilver the shores of isles up north",
