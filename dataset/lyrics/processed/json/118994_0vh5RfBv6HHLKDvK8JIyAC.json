  "lyrics": "That sunset straight up as it gets\r\nShort shorts resting just right on your hips\r\nKiss chilling on your lips\r\nI'm for sure going to get it in a minute\r\nFirst time I take another sip\r\nThat Chevrolet sitting in the driveway\n\nIs going to stay sitting, girl we ain't get anywhere, but closer\n\nI know you're in the mood with literally nothing but each other on the to-do list\n\n\n\nWe got all damn day to do it our way\n\nLike an old tire swing in the shade\n\nGot it made in the sweet spot\n\nBaby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride\n\nDon't matter if we're sitting on the porch, in the car, at a bar\n\nOr a boat down in Panama City\n\nGonna be a hell of a view\n\nI'm just fine long as I'm sitting next to you sittin' pretty (yeah)\n\nI'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty\n\n\n\nEverything is feeling like it should\n\nDon't think that it could, get any better\n\nBut this weather I wish it would\n\nTurn up the heat, couple degrees\n\nGet you in that AC, let down them blinds\n\nCall it a day\n\n\n\nWe got all damn day to do it our way\n\nLike an old tire swing in the shade\n\nGot it made in the sweet spot\n\nBaby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride\n\nDon't matter if we're sitting on the porch, in the car, at a bar\n\nOr a boat down in Panama City\n\nGonna be a hell of a view\n\nI'm just fine long as I'm sitting next to you sittin' pretty (yeah)\n\nI'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty (damn)\n\nI'm sitting pretty good\n\n\n\nPretty as a peach\n\nAs a postcard picture\n\nOf a west coast beach\n\nSo pretty, if I had to bet\n\nThis is pretty much as good as it gets\n\n\n\nWe got all damn day to do it our way\n\nLike an old tire swing in the shade\n\nGot it made in the sweet spot\n\nBaby, you and me got a couple free seats on a cloud nine ride\n\nDon't matter if we're sitting on the porch, in the car, at a bar\n\nOr a boat down in Panama City\n\nGonna be a hell of a view\n\nI'm just fine long as I'm sitting next to you sittin' pretty\n\n(Yeah, I'm sitting pretty good)\n\nI'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty\n\n(Yeah, I'm sitting pretty good)\n\nI'm sitting pretty good, I'm sitting pretty\n\n(Yeah, I'm sitting pretty good)\n\nI'm sitting pretty good",
