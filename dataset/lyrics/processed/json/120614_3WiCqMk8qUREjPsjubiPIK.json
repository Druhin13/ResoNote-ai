Or is you ain't?\n\nApply that to anything, as long as I can memory\n\nWhite diamonds with the blackface, cultural appropriate\n\nSour, you can smell that from across teh way\n\nSmokin' Hadouken, yeah, on that Kamehameha\n\nThat's just how we stay up, stay up, ask my neighbor, neighbor\n\nNiggas solid 'til you liquidated, I've never been that way, I swear\n\nYou feel just like a Saturday\n\nI might just roll a zip on your hips, but first\n\nTell me the truth\n\nWhat would you do for my love?\n\nI bet you would shoot out the Jag, right?\n\nYou'd let me crash 'til my bag right\n\nYou see this cup in my hand, I’m\n\n’Bout to end up seein' twins, I\n\nHope you still fuck with me if I\n\nI... (*Throws up*)\n\n\n\nIt was gruesome, what we grew from\n\nBut we grew some in the end\n\nAin’t enough to be were you from\n\nHad to be mixed with some Indian\n\nShawty say she creole, I crack the Clicquot\n\nIt leaked over, drunk sex once again\n\nGet my no fatigue on, until I tip over, tree rolled up\n\nCan't sleep, done got the spins\n\n\n\nLost in the sauce like the chip broke (Off)\n\nI was fucked up, down to my last four (Dollars)\n\nDollars, barely eatin', sleepin' at the studio\n\nBut last night I fucked a bitch so cute she need a movie role (Me)\n\nRobbery or lottery, feel like that’s how it's gotta be\n\nI never felt so unlucky, no, never\n\nNo one understands my brain, I numb my mind on novocaine\n\nYou said that you would love me forever\n\n\n\nGoddamn, uh, I can take you down to the... to the, to the store. I'm like, \"What you talk—you 'bout to—what you talkin' 'bout?\" He... you know, down here, it's just... you go to the corner store you gon' find somebody. Like, we, we bet. So we brought hella folks to this corner store and post. Shit was lookin' bleak. Then we, then we just go somewhere else and we just post again... Memphis Bleek. Then Smi just hop out like, and some just random security guard niggas and he's just like, \"Ayy, you know where some green at?\" Dudes was like, \"Hot damn\"",
