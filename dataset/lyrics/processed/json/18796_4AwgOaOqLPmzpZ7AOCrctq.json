  "lyrics": "I’ll have a drink tonight\r\nI’ll get to feelin' alright\r\nMy eyes get chained to you\r\nI can’t seem to make them do\r\nJust what I want to anymore\r\nIf I close em now\n\nI’ll hit the floor\n\nAnd the next thing I know\n\nThe sunlight’s breakin' day\n\n\n\nIf I get the chance to breath\n\nI’ll try to do it with ease\n\nFor if too hard I inhale\n\nI fear I lose the trail\n\nBeneath the freshly scattered brush\n\nThough it really don’t matter all that much\n\nI guess I’ll just have to find another way\n\n\n\nI’ll lie awake in bed\n\nGoing over the things I said\n\nI’d say em all again\n\nIf I thought you’d spend\n\nJust one more night with me alone\n\nNow I can’t even get you on the phone\n\nIt's all just a ruse like a trick some fool has played\n\n\n\nNow the room is spinnin’ round\n\nCan’t seem to slow it down\n\nIf I’m taken by the night\n\nTell my ma I did alright\n\nI just couldn’t stop all the time\n\nI just kept standing there in line\n\nWaiting until\n\nTomorrow goes away\n\nJust trying to kill\n\nSome time and make it pay\n\n\n\nI go up on a hill\n\nDown on my knees and pray\n\nLet someday it will\n\nWhen tomorrow goes away",
