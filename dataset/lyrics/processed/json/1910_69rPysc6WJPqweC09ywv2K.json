  "lyrics": "I am an old woman named after my mother\r\nMy old man is another child that's grown old\r\nIf dreams were lightning thunder was desire\r\nThis old house would have burnt down a long time ago\r\nMake me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry\n\nMake me a poster of an old rodeo\n\nJust give me one thing that I can hold on to\n\nTo believe in this living is just a hard way to go\n\n\n\nWhen I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy \n\nHe weren't much to look at, just free rambling man\n\nBut that was a long time and no matter how I try\n\nThe years just flow by like a broken down dam.\n\n\n\nMake me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry\n\nMake me a poster of an old rodeo\n\nJust give me one thing that I can hold on to\n\nTo believe in this living is just a hard way to go\n\n\n\nThere's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing\n\nAnd I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.\n\nHow the hell can a person go to work in the morning\n\nAnd come home in the evening and have nothing to say.\n\n\n\nMake me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry\n\nMake me a poster of an old rodeo\n\nJust give me one thing that I can hold on to\n\nTo believe in this living is just a hard way to go",
