  "lyrics": "I like the bags under your eyes\r\nIt makes me wonder what you lose sleep over\r\nAnd if I could be of any help\r\nMe, it's late in the AM, my thoughts are overflowing\r\nAnd pouring, just bathe in my mind with me\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\n\n\nMy heart races when I write a new day\n\nI feel I'm running out of time to leave my lines that last time\n\nBut does it even matter anyway, oh\n\nI think it is just my pride getting in the way\n\n\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul\n\n\n\nCause we're all lovely and we're ugly\n\nGive me your lovely, lovely, lovely\n\nWe're all lovely and we're ugly\n\nGive me your lovely, lovely, lovely\n\nWe're all lovely and we're ugly\n\nBut give me your lovely, lovely, lovely\n\nBaby, I need your sweet soul",
