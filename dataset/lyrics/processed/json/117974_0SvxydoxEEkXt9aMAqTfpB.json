Just wait\n\nCan we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait\n\nCan you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you\n\n\n\nWait, can you turn around, can you turn around? Just wait\n\nCan we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait\n\nCan you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you\n\n\n\nCan we talk for a moment?\n\nGot these feelings that I'm tired of holding on\n\nWasn't tryna get wasted\n\nI needed more than three or four to say this\n\n\n\nOh, let me apologize (yeah)\n\nI'll make up, make up, make up, make up for all those times\n\nYour love, I don't wanna lose\n\nI'm beggin', beggin', beginn', beggin', I'm begging you\n\n\n\nWait, can you turn around, can you turn around?

Just wait\n\nCan we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait\n\nCan you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you\n\n\n\nYou say I'm just another bad guy\n\nYou say I've done a lot of things I can't undo\n\nBefore you tell me for the last time, yeah\n\nI'm beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin' you\n\n\n\nWait, can you turn around, can you turn around? Just wait\n\nCan we work this out, can we work this out? Just wait\n\nCan you call me please? 'Cause I wanna be with you\n\n\n\nWait, can you turn around, can you turn around?
