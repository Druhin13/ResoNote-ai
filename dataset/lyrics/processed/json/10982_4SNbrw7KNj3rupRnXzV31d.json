  "lyrics": "I’m trying to learn the difference between love and codependence\r\nAnd why it makes my insides ache\r\nAnd I can’t tell if you’re something I need or the feeling that I should shake\r\nI need to start being honest with myself\r\nAnd how I feel\n\n\n\nMaybe if I tell myself that I’m doing fine\n\nYou would stick around and wouldn’t mind me feeling so low\n\n\n\nI’m trying to stop focusing on the bad parts of my head\n\nBecause I know how it feels to be on the receiving end of it\n\n\n\nI need to start taking care of myself\n\nAnd how I feel\n\n\n\nMaybe if I tell myself that I’m doing fine\n\nYou would stick around and wouldn’t mind me feeling so low\n\nIt gets so fucking old and I’m getting too old\n\n\n\nI’m bitter now, but one day I won’t be\n\nI’ll be sitting at a party, laughing while you’re smiling it’s all…\n\nAnd i’m angry now but one day I won’t be\n\nI’ll be holding your hand, swearing I’m happy\n\n\n\nI’m happy, I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m home",
