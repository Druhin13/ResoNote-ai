  "lyrics": "Not everyone gets drunk without a drop of wine\r\nOr a sip of 90 proof, but I do\r\nNot everybody loves getting caught at red lights\r\nThey got no one to lean into, but I do\r\nYou don't know how many times and minutes you cross my mind\r\nAnd I don't know what I did so right\n\n\n\nJust when I think it couldn't get any better\n\nTo be the man standing in my shoes\n\nThere you go walking in in a new dress\n\nSaying \"do you like this?\"\n\nAnd baby, I do\n\nWanna hold you forever\n\nNo, I ain't ever been so sure\n\nJust when I think I couldn't love you any more\n\nBaby, I do, I do, I do\n\nBaby, I do, I do, I do\n\n\n\nYeah girl you're beautiful\n\nJust takes one look to see\n\nBut no one sees the sides of you like I do\n\nLike your hair in a mess in the morning\n\nThat wake up, no makeup smile\n\nThat I can't believe I open my eyes to\n\nBut I do\n\n\n\nJust when I think it couldn't get any better\n\nTo be the man standing in my shoes\n\nThere you go walking in in a new dress\n\nSaying \"do you like this?\"\n\nAnd baby, I do\n\nWanna hold you forever\n\nNo, I ain't ever been so sure\n\nJust when I think I couldn't love you any more\n\nBaby, I do, I do, I do\n\nBaby, I do, I do, I do\n\n\n\nNo I don't ever fall like this\n\nI never found myself wanting to jump in so quick\n\nBut there's something different about you\n\n'Cause I do\n\n\n\nJust when I think it couldn't get any better\n\nTo be the man standing in my shoes\n\nI start thinking about you in a white dress\n\nFront of that church kiss\n\nSaying \"I do\"\n\nWanna hold you forever\n\nNo, I ain't ever been so sure\n\nJust when I think I couldn't love you any more\n\nBaby, I do, I do, I do\n\nBaby, I do, I do, I do\n\n\n\nBaby, I do wanna hold you forever\n\nI don't ever wanna let you go\n\nAnd every day, I'm gonna let you know\n\nHow much that I do, I do, I do\n\n'Cause baby I do, I do, I do",
