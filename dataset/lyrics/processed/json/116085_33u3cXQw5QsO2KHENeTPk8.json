  "lyrics": "I went down to the corner just to meet my gal\r\nI found her standin' on the sidewalk, she was talkin' to my pal\r\nI strolled back to the bar room to get another drink of gin\r\nBut the first thing I knew, I was reelin', rockin' and drunk again\r\nWell, I kept on drinkin' gin and liquor way up into the night\r\nWhen my pal walked into the bar room\n\nMan, we had a terrible fight\n\nI reached down for my razor, and then I knocked around\n\nBut when I pulled my pistol, I quickly smoked him down\n\n\n\nI went down to see my baby, and met her on the way\n\nI told her I had to leave her, I told her I could not stay\n\nI started down to the station and stopped in at the bar\n\nAnd there I met a policeman\n\nHe was cruisin' down in his car\n\nMy baby came in to join us, and then it began to rain\n\nThen I was in a hurry, had to catch that midnight train\n\nI laid my head on the bar room door\n\nI'll never get drunk no more\n\nI pawn my watch and my golden chain\n\nI pawn my baby's diamond ring\n\n\n\nI said, hey hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey\n\nHey hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey",
