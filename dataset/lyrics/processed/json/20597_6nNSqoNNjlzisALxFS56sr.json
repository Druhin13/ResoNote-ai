Ooh\n\n\n\nI can't say\n\nWhere will I be when the walls stop shaking?\n\nI can't stay\n\nWhere will you be when my heart's still breaking?\n\n\n\nIt's in the air\n\nIt's something in the way she drifts up there\n\nIt's in the air\n\nSomething in the way she drifts up there\n\nOh, it's in the air\n\nSomething in the way she drifts up there\n\n\n\nOh no, she don't need anything\n\nOh no, she don't need anyone\n\nI could say she's been here for us\n\nI could say she's been there for you\n\nOh no, she don't need anything\n\nOh no, she don't need anyone\n\nI could say she's been here for us\n\nI could say she's been there for you\n\nOh no, she don't need anything\n\nOh no, she don't need anyone\n\nI could say she's been here for us",
