  "lyrics": "Yeah stuck on this elevator I swear he ain't moving\r\nSwear I'm doing my best and I'll never do less\r\nUnless somebody got a gun to my head\r\nThe sun is where I'm heading shining till I'm dead in the bed\r\nThe bed sleep in the weekend It's going to fast\r\nSometimes I feel like it will never end\n\nSometimes it never lasts\n\nBut that's okay because half the time I never know what day it is\n\nAnyways I'll keep repeating I'm just going to keep playing it\n\nLike pubg last alive my hands sweaty shacking I seen the patient\n\nI've been away ages check the label check the table\n\nGuess I'm able to be something different more then what I thought\n\nI accumulated something greater more than what I lost\n\nI'm a lost soul bring the heat up still cold\n\nNumbers in my billfold\n\nThunder in the hill cold\n\nWith the beamer real slow\n\nI've been living real low\n\nI just want to chill though way up in the hills woah\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in 92 but feeling like I'm close to 98\n\nAll I do is sit inside my room I rather hide away\n\nGot some time to kill don't know if I sign a deal\n\nOh I know I'm going to keep doing this to my mind is healed\n\nI've been spinning around and running in circles\n\nI need a curfew been like they working\n\nNever end and never going to finish till I find my purpose\n\nKind of nervous with feature has the store\n\nThere's the door open up and close the other one\n\nI need some more\n\nOpportunities need something new to me\n\nThis ordinary every other day is getting in the way\n\nOf what I'm soon to be\n\nI know it takes a minute for success\n\nI hope that I don't blow it\n\nThe only way from here is up and there's no sign of slowing",
