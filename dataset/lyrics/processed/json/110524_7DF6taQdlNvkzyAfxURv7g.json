  "lyrics": "The casino floor is full of men so frightened\r\nTrying to make a pay\r\nYeah, we win or lose we know just how our night ends\r\nGonna throw it all away\r\nOh, but suddenly you draw the queen of diamonds\r\nAnd everyone around you fills with silence\n\nAnd everyone around you turns to silence\n\nAnother reason, yeah, to keep on smiling for a change\n\nChange, for a change\n\nAnother plee to keep the repo man from dialing your name\n\nAgain and again\n\n\n\nWhen you think of all those gifts that you might give her\n\nJust trying to make her stay\n\nAnd you remember all that love she carried with her\n\nBefore you gambled it away\n\nLike a bitter, cheap champaign\n\nBut now that's history, you've drawn the queen of diamonds\n\nThere'll be limousines and caribbean islands\n\nYou can't wait to see her standing there just smiling\n\nFor a change, change, for a change\n\nWhat a cruel, cruel game\n\n\n\nAnd these dreams you dream they bring you your ambition\n\nAnd those whiskey drings they give you your ambition\n\nWhile the bar lady is just one for their commission\n\nBut it doesn't stop a sucker like you wishing it away\n\nOh, you better be drawing the queen of diamonds\n\nThere'll be limousines and caribbean islands\n\nYou can't wait to see her standing there just smiling\n\nFor a change, change, for a change\n\nWhat a cruel, cruel shame\n\n\n\nOh, you better be drawing the queen of diamonds\n\nThere'll be limousines and caribbean islands\n\nI can't wait to see her standing there just smiling\n\nFor a change, change, for a change",
