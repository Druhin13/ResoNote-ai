  "lyrics": "Someone in a dangerous place\r\nSomeone got lost somewhere\r\nMany people are locked outside\r\nMany people lost out there\r\nMany people they can't get in\n\nMany people they pay no mind\n\nMany people they leave this place\n\nAnd many people are freed of time\n\n\n\nWell now this man he could be king\n\nThis woman she's the royalty\n\nThis woman she's brave and strong\n\nShe's got no name but she is family\n\n\n\nGasoline and dirty sheets\n\nPolitics and painted face\n\nShe says that freedom costs too much\n\nShe says the mind is not place\n\n\n\nThis situation drags me down\n\nThey form a country in my house\n\nOn the stage and in the street\n\nI will be a human being\n\n\n\nI will come down off the stage\n\nThe marketplace and the shopping mall\n\nInto the house, the rooms of war\n\nLook at me now and recall\n\n\n\nVacuum-packed don't rock my world\n\nAnd the money back guarantee don't make my day\n\nAnd no feeling of security\n\nThey say the answer's one click away\n\n\n\nGasoline and dirty sheets\n\nPolitics and a painted face\n\nShe says that freedom costs too much\n\nShe says the mind is not place\n\n\n\nGasoline and dirty sheets\n\nPolitics and a painted face\n\nShe says that freedom costs too much\n\nShe says the mind is not place",
