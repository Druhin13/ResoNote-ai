  "lyrics": "Seems like once upon a time ago\r\nI was where I was supposed to be\r\nMy vision was true and my heart was too\r\nThere was no end to what I could dream\r\nI walked like a hero into the setting sun\r\nEveryone called out my name\n\nDeath to me was just a mystery\n\nI was too busy raising up Cain\n\n\n\nBut nothing lasts forever\n\nYour best efforts don't always pay\n\nSometimes you get sick\n\nAnd don't get better\n\nThat's when life is short\n\nEven in its longest days\n\n\n\nSo you pretend not to notice\n\nThat everything has changed\n\nThe way that you look\n\nAnd the friends you once had\n\nSo you keep on acting the same\n\nBut deep down in your soul\n\nYou know you, you got no flame\n\nAnd who knows then which way to go\n\nLife is short even in its longest days\n\n\n\nAll I got here\n\nIs a rear view mirror\n\nReflections of where I've been\n\nSo you tell yourself I'll be back up on top some day\n\nBut you know there's nothing waiting up there for you anyway\n\n\n\nNothing lasts forever\n\nAnd your best efforts don't always pay\n\nSometimes you get sick\n\nAnd you don't get better\n\nThat's when life is short\n\nEven in its longest days\n\n\n\nLife is short\n\nEven in its longest days",
