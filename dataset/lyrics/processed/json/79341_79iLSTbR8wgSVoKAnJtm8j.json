  "lyrics": "Tell me\r\nWould you stay if I had to go jail?\r\nIf I didn't have no phone, would you chat through the mail?\r\nWould you be out on the road, while I'm trapped in my cell\r\nI don't know when I'm home, and it's actually hell\r\nIf I booked you a visit\n\nWould you come through or miss it?\n\nWould you take hella long when I'm asking for pictures?\n\nWould you lie to the feds, if they asked for a witness?\n\nI need to know\n\nWould you still be around, if my p's were low?\n\nYeah my Moncler's warm, but these streets are cold\n\nWould you leave if you heard that I've beaten a few?\n\nAnd you know for a fact I don't treat 'em like you\n\nWould you leave if the judge said I'm looking at 5?\n\nAnd forget bout the times that you looked in my eyes\n\nYou know what it is and I'm cooking them pies\n\nSo don't act up or be looking suprised\n\n\n\nJust tell me what it is, I swear I'm needing to know\n\nIf it ain't suttin real, then I'm needing to go\n\nI don't need the stressing, you ain't seeing my phone\n\nAnd I gotta keep stuff, I got beef on the roads\n\nAnd I know you hate when I spend time in the trap\n\nBut I like that you'd rather spend time with my stack\n\nI just need to know, if you're riding for man\n\nCos I'm living life fast, so I'm likely to crack\n\n\n\nYo the whole city's on me, so they're likely to chat\n\nWould you listen to them rumors, or silence the prats?\n\nI told you it's music, I'm writing them raps\n\nSo when you come round, I be hiding the crack\n\nAnd just over insta, you try and get mad\n\nLike I don't treat you good and be buying you bags\n\nDon't be suprised when I finally snap\n\nIf I fucked up my show, would you try get me back?\n\nIf I got your yard spun, would you try let me back?\n\nAlways ringing down my phones, like you try get me mad\n\nYo I'm just needing to know\n\nCan you roll up the weed, if I'm needing to smoke?\n\nWould you bring me my ting, if it's peak on the roads?\n\nIf my friend tried a ting, would you speak to my bro?\n\nWould you tell me the truth, or be keeping it low?\n\nAnd I know it sounds mad, but I've seen it before\n\n\n\nJust tell me what it is, I swear I'm needing to know\n\nIf it ain't suttin real, then I'm needing to go\n\nI don't need the stressing, you ain't seeing my phone\n\nAnd I gotta keep stuff, I got beef on the roads\n\nAnd I know you hate when I spend time in the trap\n\nBut I like that you'd rather spend time with my stack\n\nI just need to know, if you're riding for man\n\nCos I'm living life fast, so I'm likely to crack",
