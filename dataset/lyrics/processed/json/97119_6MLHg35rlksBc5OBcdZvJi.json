  "lyrics": "I don't read the headlines\r\nAnd I don't watch the news\r\n'Cause I lose faith in somethin' every time I do\r\nWell I don't need to bury\r\nMy head in the sand\r\nBut I'm just tryna live this life as best as I can\n\n\n\nTimes get tough\n\nBut I don't give up\n\n'Cause I know I'm not alone\n\n\n\n'Cause we all reaching for something\n\nWe're all craving change\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nIs better than today\n\nWe're all searchin' for somewhere\n\nTryin' to find a way\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nIs better than today\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nIs better than today\n\n\n\nIt's not easy sleepin'\n\nWhen I lay down in bed\n\n'Cause I got all these worries runnin' through my head\n\nAnd it's hard to keep pushin' forward\n\nWhen trouble pulls you back\n\nAnd you wake up even further from a dream you had\n\n\n\nTimes get tough\n\nBut I don't give up\n\n'Cause I know I'm not alone\n\n\n\n'Cause we all reaching for something\n\nWe're all craving change\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nIs better than today\n\nWe're all searchin' for somewhere\n\nTryin' to find a way\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nIs better than today\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow's better\n\n\n\nSo just hold on when someone breaks you\n\nJust hold on when fear shakes you\n\nJust hold on when darkness takes you\n\nJust hold on\n\n\n\n'Cause we all reaching for something\n\nWe're all craving change\n\nHopin' tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nIs better than today\n\nSo let's keep searching for somewhere\n\nWe're gonna find a way\n\nTo make tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nBetter than today\n\nLet's make tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nBetter than today\n\nLet's make tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nBetter than today\n\nLet's make tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nBetter than today\n\nLet's make tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nBetter than today\n\nLet's make tomorrow, tomorrow\n\nBetter than today",
