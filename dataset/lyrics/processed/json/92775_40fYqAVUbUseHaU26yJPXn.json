  "lyrics": "Some days, things just take\r\nWay too much of my energy\r\nI look up and the whole room's spinning\r\nYou take my cares away\r\nI can so over-complicate, people tell me to elevate\n\nFeel my blood runnin’, swear the sky's fallin'\n\nHow did I know this is fabricated? Oh\n\nTime goes by and I can’t control my mind\n\nDon't know what else to try, but you tell me every time\n\n\n\nJust keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'\n\nAnd oh, I gotta keep on, I keep on breathin'\n\nJust keep breathin' and breathin’ and breathin’ and breathin'\n\nAnd oh, I gotta keep on, I keep on breathin’, oh\n\n\n\nSometimes it's hard to find\n\nFind my way up into the clouds\n\nTune it out, they can be so loud\n\nYou remind me of a time\n\nWhen things weren't so complicated\n\nAll I need is to see your face\n\n\n\nFeel my blood runnin', swear the sky’s fallin'\n\nHow did I know this is fabricated? Mmm\n\nTime goes by and I can't control my mind\n\nDon't know what else to try, but you tell me every time\n\n\n\nJust keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'\n\nAnd oh, I gotta keep on, I keep on breathin'\n\nJust keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'\n\nAnd oh, I gotta keep on, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah\n\n\n\nMy, my air, my, my air\n\nMy, my air, air\n\n\n\nJust keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'\n\nAnd oh, I gotta keep on, I keep on breathin'\n\nJust keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'\n\nAnd oh, I gotta keep on, I keep on breathin', mmm, yeah\n\n\n\nFeel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin', oh-woah\n\nI keep on breathin', oh, yeah\n\nTime goes by and I can't control my mind\n\nI keep on breathin', mmm, yeah",
