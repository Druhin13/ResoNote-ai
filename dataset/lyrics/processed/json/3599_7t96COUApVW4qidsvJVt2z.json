  "lyrics": "Should've died about a thousand times or maybe more\r\nDon't remember any positive that ever came before\r\nIn my head I'm more dead than alive\r\nIt's a shame, you won't understand\r\nGonna let the rain come down on me and wash away\r\nGonna give away my innocence, my sympathy\n\nIn this moment I'm lost and I did it myself\n\nThere's no one to blame\n\n\n\nYou can't save my life\n\nThese events are already in motion\n\nSo don't waste my time\n\nYou keep talking me back off the ledge\n\nYour words unheard\n\nDragging me down once again\n\nWhen I'm living a lie\n\nWhen I'm shut down inside\n\nWhen I'm chasing a high\n\nWhen I'm chasing a high\n\n\n\nI am still alive but I am just an empty shell\n\nI give myself away to this lonely hollow hell\n\nIn my head, I'm afraid that I can't trust myself\n\nYou won't understand\n\n\n\nYou can't save my life\n\nThese events are already in motion\n\nSo don't waste my time\n\nYou keep talking me back off the ledge\n\nYour words unheard\n\nDragging me down once again\n\nWhen I'm living a lie\n\nWhen I'm shut down inside\n\nWhen I'm chasing a high\n\n\n\nAll hope is lost\n\nAll hope is lost\n\nAll hope is lost\n\n\n\nYou can't save my life\n\nThese events are already in motion\n\nSo don't waste my time\n\n(Don't waste my time)\n\nYou keep talking me back off the ledge\n\nYour words unheard\n\nDragging me down once again\n\nWhen I'm living a lie\n\nWhen I'm shut down inside\n\nWhen I'm chasing a high\n\nWhen I'm chasing a high\n\nWhen I'm chasing a high\n\n\n\nThere is no fix\n\nThere is no fix\n\nThere is no fix",
