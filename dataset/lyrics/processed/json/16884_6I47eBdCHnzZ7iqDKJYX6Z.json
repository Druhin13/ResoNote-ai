  "lyrics": "Me and my dog really get along \nShe don't howl when I'm screamin' my songs \nI cuss, I drink, I lie, I spit, \nGuess I really don't give a shit \nBroken and ugly yes I am \nStill I feel good divin' in Mama \n\nI'm runnin' again- odelay \n\nDown in Alabama where I'm wanted in jail \n\nI'm a little nervous in the Bible belt \n\nI'm broke I'm smoked out and passed out on the bar \n\n\n\nThen I took all the money and your grandma's car \n\nBroken and ugly yes I am \n\nStill I look good divin' in Mama \n\nI'm runnin' again- Odelay \n\nDo what ya do say what ya say \n\nDon't waste no time on yesterdays \n\nCash in your ticket to ride \n\nDon't let them talk you into walkin' \n\nInto no one else's shoes \n\nDon't be no sucker in line",
