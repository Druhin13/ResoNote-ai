  "lyrics": "That fo'-fo' goes\r\nAnywhere with me I solo stroll\r\nThat power\r\nYou know when I solo stroll\r\nYou know that fo'-fo' goes\r\nThat power\n\n\n\nNothing come to sleep as the dreams and regret\n\nCome to a swing of something less than a queen with a catch\n\nGuns and funds and cleaners hoping my cocaina will stretch\n\nI'm blood to the Mexican bilingual who go by \"The Gringo\"\n\nWho will [?] out the whole scene if you owe and he come to collect\n\nI'm what you call a triple threat\n\nI'm the one writing a rhyme, I'm the one riding\n\nI'm the one rising, I'm the one writing the check\n\nThe one with enough respect to make nigga untie ya\n\nWho's living up under the gun\n\nWho will punch your teeth in the street for bumping yo' gums\n\nWhen I'm finished all they can say is I even the odds\n\nSo many lows, some of my highs were even goodbyes\n\nGot so much dough I don't pull out, I just leave it inside\n\nMy hat be leaned to the side like Adebisi from Oz\n\nIf perhaps there were beef between you and I\n\nYou niggas would actually have to sleep in disguise\n\nFucking with power\n\n\n\nThat fo'-fo' goes\n\nAnywhere with me I solo stroll\n\nThat power\n\nYou know when I solo stroll\n\nYou know that fo'-fo' goes\n\nThat power\n\n\n\nPardon me for being too cool for this foolish industry\n\nThe cruel, demented things that I've seen through imagery\n\nDue to the ghoulish chemistry that the Devil has with the smell of cash\n\nI'm a hustler, I hop in the ocean and sell a whale a splash\n\nI'm so hot I can inhale the hash\n\nI can blow the grass until I'm actually impaling hell with ash\n\nUnhappy people focus on all the shit that's missing\n\nHappy people just focus on what the hell they have\n\nUh, Max Julien coats and RAM beepers\n\nZangief hand gest' as the man reaches\n\nThe transcending a grand 'legiance\n\nI rap till I ran Venus or land in arenas, [?]\n\nWhite hood on the Phantom looking like it's a Klan meeting\n\nAnd all that hating'll age a nigga like that Japan region\n\nMy fam told me my flow remind 'em of 'Pac or BIG\n\nI told 'em \"I'm sick, you can't just go to the doc for this\"\n\nWhy you out here gossipping? Labels tryna sign me\n\nDespite the fact that I'm strapped like I'm in a zombie apocalypse\n\nUh, nigga, they can score how they wanna score\n\nI don't always be on the charts but I stay on the boards\n\nI don't do beef, I just make you wear the shit out of this two-piece\n\nWhenever I see yo' ass like Paloma Ford\n\nI don't care if they find you at the game and you on the floor\n\nYou gon' get this fucking E. Honda, not on your own Accord\n\nUh, now let's put this all in perspective here\n\nMe, I'm on the legend tier\n\nYou, you on the second tier, you definitely scared\n\nYou move like you borrowed the first letter from the word \"faggot\"\n\nYou put effort to put the \"F\" in \"fear\"\n\nMy pen is potentially grimace the penitentiary\n\nI'm the splitting image of Dempsey\n\nY'all niggas Ren & Stimpy\n\nEverything about you new niggas is Mickey D's\n\nY'all niggas tempt me, but even y'all dudes grimace Mickey\n\n\n\nThat fo'-fo' goes\n\nAnywhere with me I solo stroll\n\nThat power\n\nYou know when I solo stroll\n\nYou know that fo'-fo' goes\n\nThat power",
