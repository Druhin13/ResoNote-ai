  "lyrics": "Another offering, another open door\r\nAnother effort you ignore\r\nStory line I purged so blatantly\r\nStill you never notice me\r\nStill await for you to come around in time\n\nStill await for you to read between the lines\n\nCome on, come on, read between the lines\n\n\n\nAnother glance, another hint of what I want\n\nThe subtle in your window falls\n\nStill deny if I could only make you see\n\nI would give you what you need\n\n\n\nStill await for you to come around in time\n\nStill await for you to read between the lines\n\nCome on, come on, read between the lines\n\n\n\nIt's been so long, there are times I start to question\n\nIf the colons allowed in line\n\nIs it so wrong longing for what can't be mentioned\n\nYou're too headstrong, taken me just one try\n\nOh, just one try\n\n\n\nCome on, come on, read between the lines\n\nCome on, come on, it's there for you to find\n\nCome on, come on, it's obvious, I don't pretend\n\nOh oh\n\n\n\nStill await for you to come around in time\n\nStill await for you to read between the lines\n\nCome on, come on, read between the lines\n\nStill await for you to come around in time\n\nStill await for you to read between the lines\n\nCome on, come on, read between the lines",
