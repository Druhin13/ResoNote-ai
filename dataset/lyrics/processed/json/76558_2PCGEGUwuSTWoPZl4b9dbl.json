  "lyrics": "1, 2, what you gonna do\r\nDon't try to procrastinate\r\nPutting off a choice you have to make\r\nYou wait and you wait and react too late\r\nAnd you need a little help so you pass the plate\n\nStop looking at me I can't interfere\n\nYou need to take a look at the man in the mirror\n\nJust step up, don't string me along\n\nWhen you sing me a song my sympathy's gone\n\nSo let it drop or get off the pot\n\nYou can motor your mouth now walk the walk\n\nAnd make it clear what you desire\n\nThe bomb is ticking choose a wire\n\n\n\nDo or die, the truth or lies\n\nGet involved or move aside\n\nStay or go, raise or fold\n\nSlip and fall or gain control\n\nBut right now\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nIt's time for you to decide\n\nYou've got to make up your mind (right now)\n\nStand up you know you can't hide\n\nYou've got to make up your mind (right now)\n\nIt's time for you to decide\n\nYou've got to make up your mind (right now)\n\nStand up you know you can't hide\n\nYou've got to make up your mind (right now)\n\n\n\nYour decision please, I'm counting to three\n\nMay I take your order, what'll it be\n\nNo room for your ambiguity\n\nDo you know what this is doing to me\n\nYou wanna sit on the sideline, trying to buy time\n\nMan, grow a spine stop calling for lifelines\n\nDraggin this out to the point of exhaustion\n\nCause you're lost and you can't pick an option\n\nThis whole act I'm not buying at all\n\nYou're just trying to stall, you'll only heighten the fall\n\nCause you can't keep, can't keep runnin away\n\nIs it coming today or another delay\n\n\n\nGive or take, a risk or safe\n\nThe perfect choice or big mistake\n\nMouse or man, lie down or stand\n\nLower your voice or shout command\n\nBut right now\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nDo or die, the truth or lies\n\nGet involved or move aside\n\nStay or go, raise or fold\n\nSlip and fall or gain control but right now\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nYou gotta do it man\n\nYou've got to make up your mind\n\nThat's right, come on\n\nYou've got to make up your mind\n\nStop stalling, you better do it\n\nYou've got to make up your mind\n\nCome on, right now\n\nYou've got to make up your mind\n\nLet's get outta here\n\nSick of that stuff, you gotta make up your mind\n\nStop talking, talking and talking\n\nIt's called action man",
