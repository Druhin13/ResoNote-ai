  "lyrics": "Hard to bless through the rain clouds\r\nWe tried to get home\r\nTo select another [?]\r\nWhen it hit the ground again\r\nHard [?] breakage in me\r\nI felt my arrow bow\n\nI have so little time left in me\n\nI knew how much to know\n\n\n\nFive-hundred aerial miles to go\n\nMy hair is roasting, we smell like smoke\n\nAnd there is no distance long enough\n\nBut still the lengths to which we go\n\nOur achievements and our powers, yeah\n\nAnd our promises and hopes\n\nFive-hundred aerial miles to go\n\n\n\nHow else did I think I would\n\nFind you, but we'll always be good\n\nSquinting hard at the printed word\n\nBy the failing light of the sun\n\nWe want our wishes to bow to us\n\nBut they have a life of their own\n\nOh, let the sunlight tarry on\n\nBut I just want to say \"hello\", hello\n\n\n\nFive-hundred aerial miles to go\n\nThe earth flames red in heat and smoke\n\nAnd there is no distance long enough\n\nBut still the lengths to which we go\n\nOur beliefs and our distractions\n\nOur performances and codes\n\nFive-hundred aerial miles to go\n\n\n\nI want to take [?] to mean\n\nThere is no such thing as truth\n\nIt is hard to admit you were all wrong\n\nAccept some things are not for you",
