  "lyrics": "[Alice Cooper/Dick Wagner/Desmond Child]\r\nThe city streets are wet with rain tonight\r\nTaxi drivers swerve from lane to lane\r\nA lonely guitar man playin' down the hall\r\nMidnight blues comin' through the walls\n\n\n\nI tried to call you on the telephone\n\nI left it off the hook\n\nJust to hear it ring\n\nYou told me you were better off alone\n\nI never knew that tears could stain\n\n\n\nI'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars\n\nLookin' down at all the cars\n\nI can see you\n\nIn the window of your favorite corner bar\n\nBut to reach you is just too far\n\nAnd I might as well be on Mars\n\n\n\nThe city seems so old and grey and beat\n\nIt closes in and makes me wanna suffocate\n\nAnd you just live across the street\n\nBut that's a billion miles away\n\n\n\nYou've turned my world into a dark and lonely place\n\nLike a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'\n\nI'd cross the universe to be right where you are\n\nBut I'm right in your backyard\n\nAnd I might as well be on Mars\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\nI might as well be on Mars\n\nYou can't see me\n\nI might as well be the Man on the Moon\n\nYou can't hear me\n\nOh, can you feel me so close\n\nAnd yet so far\n\nBaby, I might as well be on Mars\n\n\n\nBaby, I can't fly\n\nIf I could I'd come down to ya\n\nMaybe I should try\n\n\n\nI'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars\n\nLookin' down at all lthe cars\n\nI can see you\n\nIn the window of your favorite corner bar\n\nBut to reach is just too far\n\nAnd I might as well be on Mars\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]",
