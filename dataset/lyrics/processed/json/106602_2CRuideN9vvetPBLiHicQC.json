'Cause you can't go wrong\r\n'Cause you can't go, can't go wrong\n\nTouching the sky, my feet on the ground\n\nYour legs in the air, we messing around\n\nYou got away from somebody else\n\nBut that won't be me, so kiss me and tell\n\n\n\nOh won't you open up to me my love?\n\nUnlock and throw away the key my love\n\nMy momma told me how to treat my love (my love)\n\nWhatever you want it to be my love, it's gon' be my love\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong\n\nHow does it feel? What are you on?\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong\n\nHow do you feel? What are you on?\n\n\n\nHead in the clouds, hands on your waist\n\nBody's in motion, you set the pace\n\nLet me go down, see how it taste\n\nRolling around, all tangled up, all over the place\n\n\n\nOh won't you open up to me my love?\n\nUnlock and throw away the key my love\n\nMy momma told me how to treat my love (my love)\n\nWhatever you want it to be my love, it's gon' be my love\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong (go wrong)\n\nHow does it feel? (how does it feel?) What are you on? (what are you on?)\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong\n\nHow do you feel? What are you on? (what are you on?)\n\n\n\n'Cause you can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you on? 'Cause you can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you on? 'Cause you can't go, can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you on? 'Cause you can't go wrong\n\n'Cause you can't go wrong\n\n\n\nThe day I met you was a dream\n\nMost beautiful I'd ever seen\n\nAnd now I finally felt complete\n\nI swear that I could never leave\n\nI won't leave, I won't leave!\n\n\n\nOh won't you open up to me my love?\n\nUnlock and throw away the key my love\n\nMy momma told me how to treat my love (my love)\n\nWhatever you want it to be my love, it's gon' be my love\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong (can't go wrong)\n\nHow does it feel? (how does it feel?)\n\nWhat are you on? (what are you on?)\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong\n\nHow do you feel? (how do you feel?) What are you on?\n\n\n\n'Cause you can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you on? 'Cause you can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you on? 'Cause you can't go, can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you on? 'Cause you can't go wrong\n\n'Cause you can't go, can't go wrong\n\nWhat are you\n\n\n\nOh baby, I'm ready\n\nOh baby, I'm ready to go, oh yeah\n\nOh baby\n\nYou can say what you want when you want 'cause you can't go wrong",
