  "lyrics": "Getting by has always been a thing that I must do\r\nMaking money from some senseless thing that I can't choose\r\nBurning heat on the street and I've got worn out shoes on my feet\r\nAm I just a slave?\r\nAm I just a slave?\n\nAm I just a slave?\n\nAm I just a slave?\n\n\n\nOne of these days I'm gonna break break free\n\nOne of these days I'm gonna break these chains\n\nRain rain rain\n\nOn my telephone\n\nGone gone gone\n\nAnd no one's home\n\n\n\nMasters of the pyramids\n\nSelling scratches to the zombies in brazil\n\nAnd everyone is poor and no one knows what to do\n\nHanging on the corner by a wall so I can see what is true\n\n\n\nAm I just a slave?\n\nAm I just a slave?\n\nAm I just a slave?\n\nAm I just a slave?\n\n\n\nOne of these days I'm gonna break break free\n\nOne of these days I'm gonna break these chains\n\nRain rain rain\n\nOn my telephone\n\nGone gone gone\n\nAnd no one's home",
