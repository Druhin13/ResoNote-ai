  "lyrics": "Head below the surface of a frozen lake\r\nHead in the black water, let it seep into my brain\r\nGod around your neck, though he never did too much for you\r\nI wish I knew him better, though I don't think there's much he'd wanna do\r\nI'm not yours\n\nKnow when I mean it I'm not wasted anymore\n\n\n\nTomorrow night's impatience and an endless perfect world\n\nThe morning bleeds into the golden dream just like before\n\nTomorrow I'll feel differently but my mind will be made up\n\nTimes that I could buy your love, though I don't think that I'd have enough\n\n\n\nI'm not yours\n\nKnow when I mean it I'm not wasted anymore\n\n\n\nStupid, stupid me, me, me, me",
