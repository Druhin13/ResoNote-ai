  "lyrics": "You say \"I love you boy\"\r\nBut I know you lie.\r\nI trust you all the same\r\nAnd I don't know why.\r\n'Cause when my back is turned,\n\nMy bruises shine.\n\nOur broken fairytale,\n\nSo hard to hide.\n\n\n\nI still believe,\n\nIt's you and me \n\ntill the end of time.\n\n\n\nWhen we collide we come together,\n\nIf we don't, we'll always be apart.\n\nI'll take a bruise i know you're worth it.\n\nWhen you hit me, hit me hard.\n\n\n\nSitting in a wishing hole,\n\nHoping it stays right.\n\nFeet cast in solid stone,\n\nI got Gilligan's eyes.\n\n\n\nI still believe,\n\nIt's you and me \n\ntill the end of time.\n\n\n\nWhen we collide we come together,\n\nIf we don't, we'll always be apart.\n\nI'll take a bruise i know you're worth it.\n\nWhen you hit me, hit me hard.\n\n\n\n'Cause you said hello,\n\nIt's where the going get's hard,\n\nOur future is far,\n\nMany of horror\n\nOur future's far,\n\nMany of horror\n\nOur future is far,\n\nMany of horror\n\n\n\nI still believe,\n\nIt's you and me \n\ntill the end of time.\n\n\n\nWhen we collide we come together,\n\nIf we don't we'll always be apart.\n\nI'll take a bruise i know you're worth it.\n\nWhen you hit me, hit me hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Dec for these lyrics and to idontneedapplause for these corrections)",
