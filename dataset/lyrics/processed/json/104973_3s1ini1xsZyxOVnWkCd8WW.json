  "lyrics": "Well I've been down to Georgia\r\nI've seen the streets in the west\r\nI've driven down the 90, hell I've seen America's best\r\nI've been through the Rockies, I've seen Saskatoon\r\nI've driven down the highway 1, I just hope that I'd see you soon\n\nCause I'm coming home, I'm coming home\n\n\n\nI've never been to Alaska, but I can tell you this\n\nI've been to Lincoln, Nebraska and hell you know it aint worth shit\n\nI've been through Nova Scotia, Sydney to Halifax\n\nI'll never take any pictures cause I know I'll just be right back\n\n\n\nCause I'm coming home, I'm coming home\n\n\n\nI've seen palaces in London; I've seen a castle in Wales\n\nBut I'd rather wake up beside you and breathe that ol 'familiar smell\n\nI never thought you could leave me, I figured I was the one\n\nBut I understand your sadness, so I guess I should just hold my tongue\n\n\n\nBut I'm coming home, I'm coming home\n\n\n\nI know we're takin' chances, you told me life was a risk\n\nBut I have just one last question...\n\nWill it be my heart or will it be his?\n\n\n\nComing home , I'm coming home",
