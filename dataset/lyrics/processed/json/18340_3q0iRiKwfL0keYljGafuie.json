  "lyrics": "For the last few years I've been falling behind\r\nI watch my friends grow up while I'm passing time\r\nSinging songs about moving on\r\nI don't really know what I'm running from\r\nWe took a shot standing under the lights\r\nAnd fought in parking lots like we own the night\n\nMan I know it's been way too long\n\nAnd I still don't know what I'm running from\n\n\n\nI took it for granted\n\nA long long time ago\n\n\n\nDo you remember when we were young\n\nWe'd sing at the top of our lungs\n\nIf we're going down, we ain't going down alone\n\n\n\nOver the past few years\n\nThe choices I made I was so jaded\n\nIf I could rewind I'd tape over time\n\nWith the movie that I wish that we had created\n\n\n\nI took it for granted all those years ago\n\nWe were all so sure we knew every word\n\nWe never missed a note\n\n\n\nDo you remember when we were young\n\nWe'd sing at the top of our lungs\n\nIf we're going down we ain't going down alone\n\n\n\nDo you remember when we were young\n\nAnd all we knew were the songs we sung\n\nWe ain't going down alone\n\n\n\nDo you remember when we were young\n\nAll we needed was the setting sun\n\nDo you remember when we were young\n\nWe'd keep singing even after the record was done",
