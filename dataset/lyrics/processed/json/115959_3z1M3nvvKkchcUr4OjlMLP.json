  "lyrics": "You built this world around you, your universe\r\nIn spite of best intentions, things could not be worse\r\nChaos and fear left you hangin' by a thread\r\nAs you argue with the voice inside your head\r\nUntethered angel\n\nFalling into darkness\n\nDon't be afraid of letting go\n\nGivin' up yourself won't set you free\n\n\n\nMisgivings and dismay, nightmares of wasted days\n\nCan't live your life this way, something needs to change\n\nHealthy, accepting thoughts, intent on driving us\n\nAvoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch\n\n\n\nFear can't live inside you\n\nPush you to the edge\n\nFace the fear within you\n\nWake up from the dead\n\n\n\nUntethered angel\n\nFalling into darkness\n\nDon't be afraid of letting go\n\nGivin' up yourself won't set you free\n\nSet you free\n\n\n\nUntethered angel\n\nFalling into darkness\n\nDon't be afraid of letting go\n\nOpen your heart, be set free",
