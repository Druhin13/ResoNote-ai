  "lyrics": "I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside\r\nI've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside\r\nThis evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in\r\nSo very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice\r\nMy mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry\r\nMy father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar\n\nSo really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry\n\nWell Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some music on while I pour\n\n\n\nThe neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there\n\nSay, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there\n\nI wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now\n\nTo break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell\n\nI ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer\n\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride\n\nI really can't stay - Baby don't hold out\n\nAhh, but it's cold outside\n\n\n\nC'mon baby\n\n\n\nI simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside\n\nThe answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside\n\nThis welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in\n\nSo nice and warm -- Look out the window at that storm\n\nMy sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious\n\nMy brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore\n\nMy maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious\n\nWell maybe just a half a drink more - Never such a blizzard before\n\n\n\nI've got to go home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there\n\nSay, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there\n\nYou've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now\n\nBut don't you see - How can you do this thing to me\n\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow\n\nAt least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died\n\nI really can't stay - Get over that old out\n\nAhh, but it's cold outside\n\n\n\nBaby it's cold outside\n\n\n\nBrr its cold...\n\nIt's cold out there\n\nCant you stay awhile longer baby\n\nWell... I really shouldn't... alright\n\n\n\nMake it worth your while baby\n\nAhh, do that again...",
