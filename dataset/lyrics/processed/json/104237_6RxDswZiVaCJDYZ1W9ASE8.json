  "lyrics": "I am a lonely painter\r\nI live in a box of paints\r\nI used to be frightened by the devil\r\nAnd drawn to those who weren't afraid\r\nRemember when you told me\n\nThat love was touching souls?\n\nWell, surely you touched mine\n\nPart of you pours out of me from time you time in these lines\n\n\n\nYou're in my blood like holy wine\n\nYou're so bitter and so sweet\n\nI could drink a case of you darling\n\nAnd still be on my feet, still be on my feet",
