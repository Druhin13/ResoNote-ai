  "lyrics": "Saw your Mama laugh and talkin' on the phone\r\nWith a little girl workin' on an ice cream cone\r\nDrippin' on her shoes\r\nAnd I thought about you\r\nSaw a spring break Honda hell-bent for Daytona\n\nThe boys in the back hiding their Corona\n\nLike kids do\n\nAnd I thought about you\n\n\n\nI thought about me\n\nI thought about God\n\nEverything love is\n\nAnd everything it's not\n\n\n\nI thought about songs that make us feel better\n\nI thought about faith that ties it all together\n\nI thought about now, then thought about forever\n\nI thought about fire and how we walked through it\n\nThe times I got it right, the times I blew it\n\nI thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true\n\nAnd I thought about you\n\n\n\nI saw \"hungry\" misspelled on a cardboard sign\n\nAnd a dirty tee shirt that said \"Roll Tide\"\n\nSo I gave him a few\n\nAnd I thought about you\n\n\n\nRan into a buddy, he said \"How long's it been?\"\n\nI said \"A couple years,\" he said \"Boy, it's been ten\"\n\nThat's what time'll do\n\nAnd I thought about you\n\n\n\nI thought about songs that make us feel better\n\nI thought about faith that ties it all together\n\nI thought about now, then thought about forever\n\nI thought about fire and how we walked through it\n\nThe times I got it right, the times I blew it\n\nI thought about real, I thought about good, I thought about true\n\nAnd I thought about you\n\nI thought about you\n\n\n\nI thought about me\n\nI thought about God\n\nEverything love is\n\nAnd everything it's not\n\n\n\nI saw a red balloon somebody just let fly\n\nI watched it gettin' smaller up in the sky\n\nFor a minute or two\n\nAnd I thought about you",
