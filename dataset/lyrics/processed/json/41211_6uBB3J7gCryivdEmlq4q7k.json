  "lyrics": "When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;\r\nWhen troubles come and my heart burdened be;\r\nThen, I am still and wait here in the silence,\r\nUntil you come and sit awhile with me.\r\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;\n\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;\n\nI am strong, when I am on your shoulders;\n\nYou raise me up: To more than I can be.\n\n\n\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;\n\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;\n\nI am strong, when I am on your shoulders;\n\nYou raise me up: To more than I can be.\n\n\n\nThere is no life - no life without its hunger;\n\nEach restless heart beats so imperfectly;\n\nBut when you come and I am filled with wonder,\n\nSometimes, I think I glimpse eternity.\n\n\n\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;\n\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;\n\nI am strong, when I am on your shoulders;\n\nYou raise me up: To more than I can be.\n\n\n\nYou raise me up, so I can stand on mountains;\n\nYou raise me up, to walk on stormy seas;\n\nI am strong, when I am on your shoulders;\n\nYou raise me up: To more than I can be.\n\n\n\nYou raise me up: To more than I can be",
