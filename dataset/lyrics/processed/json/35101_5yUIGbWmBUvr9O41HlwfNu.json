  "lyrics": "One man to sail the oceans,\r\nOne man to leave the ground behind\r\nDeep down we strive to be more than we are\r\nTamed the fire and the world was ours\r\nWe build it up, reaching for the heavens\n\nA pile of stone to stand the test of time\n\nWe brought light to shame the sun\n\nAnd we always found a way\n\n\n\nAnd I don't care if you don't care\n\nBecause our dreams have always taken us where\n\nAmazing fantasies become today's realities\n\n\n\nWe will be victorious\n\nIn the blink of an eye we ascend to the sky\n\nWe'll be glorious, victorious we rise\n\n'Cause we're gonna be and won't stop 'til we are victorious\n\n\n\nOne man to split the atom,\n\nOne man to tread another world\n\nInside we know that we have what it takes\n\nFaster, stronger, higher than before\n\n\n\nThe spoken word, the ink on paper\n\nAstounding beauty for the eyes and ears\n\nAll this, when we stand together\n\nWhen we stand as one\n\n\n\nI don't care if you don't care\n\nBecause our dreams have always taken us where\n\nAmazing fantasies become today's realities\n\n\n\nWe will be victorious\n\nIn the blink of an eye we ascend to the sky\n\nWe'll be glorious, victorious and somehow\n\nWe'll rise to the challenge\n\n\n\nBut fading are our smiles\n\nConfidence is fleeting\n\nEmbrace this plight, and yield before the fire\n\nUnderstand, this time we cannot make it alone\n\nOur failure is forever\n\nThrough the wind and rain\n\nPushing through the masses\n\nWent against the grain\n\nAs she opened up our eyes for us to see\n\nCrying out, an angel to reveal her mystery\n\nA savior in the dark,\n\nI know she can sway their minds\n\nI promise, she will never let us down,\n\nOf course she will defend our way of life\n\n\n\nHere we stand before the world\n\nThe solution is simple, the answer is her!\n\nWe'll send one of us, for all of us\n\nAnd the truth in her voice will be heard\n\n\n\nWe will be victorious\n\nIn the blink of an eye she'll be sent to the sky\n\nWe'll be glorious, victorious we rise\n\nYes we're gonna be victorious!",
