  "lyrics": "You can only go so long runnin wild in the street\r\nStay grounded if flyin by the edge of your seat\r\nBring something to the table if you're trying to eat\r\nThe simple minded only hating when your style is unique\r\nThey see you slippin and they smiling discreet\r\nTry to take your place but couldn't walk a mile in your feet\n\nGotta make your own decisions don't rely on beliefs\n\nOf anybody else watch out for liars and thiefs\n\nLife is a just a test and it'll bless you if you're patient\n\nBefore you make a choice you should assess the situation\n\nBe careful what you thinking, try your best at meditation\n\nCause the thoughts inside your brain will manifest into creation\n\nSometimes it's all a matter of just clearin your head\n\nAll the worries that you have just disappear in the end\n\nMight be hard to understand now, but fear is your friend\n\nEmbrace the person staring at you in the mirror again\n\n\n\nThey say recognition is free but Respect is earned\n\nAs long you're able to breath you should be less concerned\n\nBuild a bridge for yourself and leave the rest to burn\n\nCause every mistake that you makin is a lesson learned, They say recognition is free but Respect is earned\n\nAs long you're able to breath you should be less concerned\n\nBuild a bridge for yourself and leave the rest to burn\n\nCause every mistake that you makin is a lesson learned\n\n\n\nYou Gotta think before you speak, be selective with your words\n\nIt's easier to learn if you just listen and observe\n\nYou can see the bigger picture if your vision isn't blurred\n\nWork harder than the rest and get the life that you deserve\n\nBelieve half of what you see, and none of what you heard\n\nDon't get your hopes up over nothing nothing is for sure\n\nHard to see the brighter side of shit coming from the dirt\n\nAlways gotta know your worth if they fuckin with your work\n\nGotta walk your own path don't roll with the pack\n\nTake a deep breath when shits tough, don't over react\n\nAnd all that self-inflicted doubt'll only hold you back\n\nDon't expect so much, this world don't owe you jack\n\nThey say trust takes time, and patience is a virtue\n\nBut if you let em get too close they're probably gonna hurt you\n\nDon't get yourself stuck like a rock in hard place\n\nCause even on them hard days, you gotta keep your guard raised\n\n\n\nThey say recognition is free but Respect is earned\n\nAs long you're able to breath you should be less concerned\n\nBuild a bridge for yourself and leave the rest to burn\n\nCause every mistake that you making is a lesson learned",
