  "lyrics": "I hope we get to tell these stories to our kin\r\nWe get to live peacefully, contain the nightmare deep within\r\nNuclear war, it’s just another dynasty\r\nI know I would appreciate some honesty\r\nTime and time again\n\nWatch it all end\n\nThe world is echoing\n\nThis war inside my head\n\n\n\nComprehend the struggle to defend\n\nTime and time again\n\nThis war inside my head\n\n(my head)\n\n\n\nBlood, seared by gasoline\n\nMass hypocrisy will hypnotize and crucify the weak\n\nBecause time and time again their destruction has no end\n\n\n\nWe won’t give in to their ignorance\n\nRestore our confidence because the hope we had, it never left\n\n\n\nRain falls again, our history is written in the sand\n\nAnd yesterday was in our hands\n\n\n\nRain falls again, and yesterday was in our hands\n\n\n\nTime and time again\n\nWatch it all end\n\nThe world is echoing\n\nThis war inside my head\n\n\n\nMy head\n\nOh, this war inside my head",
