  "lyrics": "Rocking around the Christmas Tree at the Christmas party hop\r\nMistletoe hung where you can see, every couple tries to stop\r\nRocking around the Christmas Tree, let the Christmas Spirit ring\r\nLater we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling\r\nYou will get a sentimental feeling when you hear\n\nVoices singing, \"Let's be jolly\"\n\n\"Deck the halls with boughs of holly\"\n\n\n\nRocking around the Christmas Tree, have a happy holiday\n\nEveryone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way\n\nCome on\n\n\n\nYou will get a sentimental feeling when you hear\n\nVoices singing, \"Let's be jolly\"\n\n\"Deck the halls with boughs of holly\"\n\n\n\nRocking around the Christmas Tree, have a happy holiday\n\nEveryone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way\n\nIn the new old-fashioned way",
