  "lyrics": "Who doesn't know what I'm talking about\r\nWho's never left home, who's never struck out\r\nTo find a dream and a life of their own\r\nA place in the clouds, a foundation of stone\r\nMany precede and many will follow\n\nA young girl's dreams no longer hollow\n\nIt takes the shape of a place out West\n\nBut what it holds for her, she hasn't yet guessed\n\n\n\nShe needs wide open spaces\n\nRoom to make her big mistakes\n\nShe needs new faces\n\nShe knows the high stakes\n\n\n\nShe traveled this road as a child\n\nWide-eyed and grinning she never tired\n\nBut now she won't be coming back with the rest\n\nIf these are life's lessons, she'll take this test\n\n\n\nShe needs wide open spaces\n\nRoom to make her big mistakes\n\nShe needs new faces\n\nShe knows the high stakes\n\n\n\nAs her folks drive away her dad yells, \"Check the oil!\"\n\nMom stares out the window and says\n\n\"I'm leaving my girl.\"\n\nShe says it didn't seem like that long ago\n\nWhen she stood there and let her own folks know\n\n\n\nShe needed wide open spaces\n\nRoom to make her big mistakes\n\nShe needs new faces\n\nShe knows the high stakes",
