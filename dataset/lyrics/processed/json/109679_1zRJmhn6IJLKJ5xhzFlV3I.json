  "lyrics": "Catch me mobbin' on an island\r\nInhale the smoke and let the vibes in\r\nLil mama work it, she be whining\r\nSo open up and I'mma dive in\r\nAnd we say, \"Ooh, spend it all\"\r\nLiving life like no tomorrow\n\nI've been sippin', I've been wildin'\n\nRunning through the city making noise like a siren\n\n\n\nI don't wanna die young, ooh\n\nI don't wanna die young, yeah\n\nThere's no time for stressin'\n\nCounting my blessings\n\nI'm on a wave ridin' out my youth\n\nI don't wanna die young, ooh\n\n\n\nI'm right back to my old ways, yeah, yeah\n\nSo tonight I do my own thing, yeah\n\nSometimes it's hard to maintain\n\nGetting' gone, gettin' sauced I feel no pain\n\nYeah, I do this on my own, need no help\n\n'Cause when I die I only got myself\n\nShe wanna take a chance, get to know me\n\nI be happy when I'm lonely and lowkey, ay\n\nMama used to tell me, \"Don't be stayin' up late\"\n\nMy friends used to always come around and crash the wave\n\nWorkin', I've been workin', I've been beefin' up my plate\n\nFishing for my dream and then it finally took the bait\n\n\n\nI don't wanna die young, ooh\n\nI don't wanna die young, yeah\n\nThere's no time for stressin'\n\nCounting my blessings\n\nI'm on a wave ridin' out my youth\n\nI don't wanna die young, ooh\n\n\n\nI don't wanna die young",
