  "lyrics": "Who's that girl? \nThe language of love \nSlips from my lover's tongue \nCooler than ice cream \nAnd warmer than the sun \n\nDumb hearts get broken \n\nJust like china cups \n\nThe language of love \n\nHas left me broken on the rocks \n\n\n\nBut there's just one thing \n\n(Just one thing) \n\nBut there's just one thing \n\nAnd I really wannna know \n\n\n\nWho's that girl \n\nRunning around with you? \n\nTell me \n\nWho's that girl \n\nRunning around with you? \n\n\n\nThe language of love \n\nHas left me stony grey \n\nTongue tied and twisted \n\nAt the price I've had to pay \n\nYour careless notions \n\nHave silenced these emotions \n\nLook at all the foolishness \n\nYour lover's talk has done",
