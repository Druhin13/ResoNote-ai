  "lyrics": "Strains of humoresque divine\r\nYou thrill and fill this heart of mine\r\nWith gladness like a soothing symphony\r\nOver the air, you gently float\r\nInto my soul, you strike a note\n\nOf passion with your melody\n\n\n\nSunbeams are playing\n\nFlowers and trees are swaying\n\nCaptured within your magic spell\n\n\n\nIf the children are dancing\n\nLovers are all romancing\n\nIs it any wonder, everyone is singing?\n\n\n\nStrains of humoresque divine\n\nYou thrill and fill this heart of mine\n\nWith gladness like a soothing symphony\n\n\n\nOver the air, you gently float\n\nInto my soul, you strike a note\n\nOf passion with your melody",
