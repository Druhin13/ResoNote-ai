  "lyrics": "Pardon me, I had to go\r\nGo and find myself on an open road\r\nBy the time\r\nI woke up in Mexico\r\nI was wasting time chasing gold\r\nI could blame it all on society\r\nFor telling me what I'm supposed to be\r\nI should get a job and settle down\r\nBut instead, I live my life out loud\r\nI was chasing more tequila\r\nWith my fears and my regrets\r\nScreaming out loud hallelujah\r\nFor the life I ain't lived yet\r\nAnd many years from now when I look back at how I misbehaved\r\nI'll have love inside my heart\r\nAnd flowers on my grave\r\nI'll be like I... I lived the fuck out of my life\r\nIf you gon' do it, do it right I lived the fuck out of my life, life\r\nThe fuck out of my life\r\nâ™ª\r\nLife, life, the fuck out of my life\r\nI put my thumb out and headed west\r\n'cause I felt this yearning in my chest\r\nAnd my father always said it best\r\nBurn the world down 'til there's nothing left\r\nI was chasing more tequila with my fears and my regrets\r\nScreaming out loud hallelujah for the life I ain't lived yet\r\nAnd many years from now when I look\r\nback at how I misbehaved\r\nI'll have love inside my heart\r\nAnd flowers on my grave I'll be\r\nlike I... I lived the fuck out of my life\r\nIf you gon' do it, do it right\r\nI lived the fuck out of my life, life\r\nThe fuck out of my life Life, life,\r\nthe fuck out of my life I lived the fuck out of my life If you gon'\r\ndo it, do it right I lived the fuck out\r\nof my life, life The fuck out of my life",
