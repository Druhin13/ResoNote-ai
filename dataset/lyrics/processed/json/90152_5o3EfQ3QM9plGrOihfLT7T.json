  "lyrics": "I met way too many fans in a day\r\nAyy, ayy, ayy\r\nI met way too many fans in a day, ayy\r\nSnuck too many Xans on the way, ayy\r\nStill be off the shits but I make twenty-something bands before we came, ayy\n\nStill look at your mans like a stain, in 3D, it’s really you, ayy\n\nI was so surprised that you came, ayy\n\nCopped me so many demons on the way, I’m off a 60 in a coupe\n\nCan’t look me in my eyes, it’s too late, ayy\n\nI spent every penny in a day, like Houdini, what I do\n\nHeard too many lies to my face, ayy\n\nThis ho on my line buildin’ cases, I got no reason to prove\n\nHeard too many lies in a day, ayy\n\nStill be off my ass in LA, I got no reason to lose\n\nYo, yo, ain’t no more options to do\n\nYo, I snuck codeine with me too, ayy\n\nI had kicked the cup, but that’s a phase, ayy\n\nI know where my heart at anyway, yo, uh, ayy\n\nHeard too many lies in a day, ayy\n\nI snuck half a 30 on a stage, vroom, demon in a desert, ayy\n\nI was high for miles, now I ain’t\n\nGuess it’s for the better when you came, ayy, woah, woah\n\nAyy, ayy, heard too many lies in a day, ayy\n\nMet too many fans in a day, whoa, uh\n\nI made twenty-something bands before we came\n\nStill look at your mans like a stain, whoa, ayy\n\nHeard too many lies in a day\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n\nI met way too many fans in a day",
