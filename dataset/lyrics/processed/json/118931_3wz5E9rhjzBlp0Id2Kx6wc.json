  "lyrics": "Lord, I offer up this rebel heart\r\nSo stubborn and so restless from the start\r\nI don't want to fight You anymore\r\nSo take this rebel heart and make it Yours\r\nFather, I no longer want to run\n\nYou've broken my resistance with Your love\n\nAnd drowned it underneath the crimson spill\n\nSo bend this rebel heart unto Your will\n\n\n\nI give it over to You\n\nI give it over to You\n\nYour love is like an arrow, straight and true\n\nAnd now this rebel heart belongs to You\n\n\n\nHelp me lay the renegade to rest\n\nTurn the stone inside me back to flesh\n\nAnd hold me 'til my best defenses fall\n\nAnd watch this rebel heart surrender all\n\n\n\nI give it over to You\n\nI give it over to You\n\nYour love is like an arrow, straight and true\n\nAnd now this rebel heart belongs to You\n\n\n\nOh, take my life and let it be Yours\n\nOh, take my life and let it be Yours\n\nOh, take my life and let it be Yours\n\nOh, take my life and let it be Yours\n\n\n\nI give it over to You\n\nI give it over to You\n\nYour love is like an arrow, straight and true\n\nAnd now this rebel heart belongs to You\n\n\n\nNow this rebel heart belongs to You\n\nNow this rebel heart belongs to You",
