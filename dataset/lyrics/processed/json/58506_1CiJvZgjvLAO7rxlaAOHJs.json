  "lyrics": "The weakest man I know is the man I see in the mirror\r\nBut it's okay to be inferior when you know Christ is superior\r\nMuch stronger than my fears and doubts He's the Overcomer\r\nHe holds me when I'm overwhelmed by the weight my soul is under\r\nFrom the highest throne is flashes of lightning and rolls of thunder\r\nYet he knows the number of hairs upon my head I'm full of wonder\n\nThat the One with universal power would be personal\n\nWith His creation as He unfolds His gracious purposes so perfectly\n\nI was purchased by the death of Jesus crucified in weakness\n\nI worship a God who weeped who intercedes for me while I sleep\n\nYes I know He hears my cries\n\nHe doesn't roll his eyes but rather He sympathizes\n\nAnd reminds me that all my needs have been provided\n\nI have no reason to trust that I could be strong enough on my own\n\nSo I gladly boast in my weakness\n\nThat Christ's power might be shown\n\nManifested through my life to prove my faith is genuine when tested\n\nCause in the depths of my weakness is when my strength gets perfected\n\n\n\nAlmighty God, omnipotent\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nI am so convinced\n\nYou hold me in my helplessness\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nI am so convinced\n\n\n\nYea I understand what means to be branded as a biblical man\n\nBut I can't stand the fact that I still try to live up to man's standards\n\nIt's really hard for me to be perceived as needy\n\nWhen everyone around me seems to be succeeding\n\nWhile making life look easy\n\nI'm constantly fighting this feeling of failing as a father\n\nAnd this feeling of falling short as a husband\n\nThe sort of never measuring up\n\nOf course it's all in my mind it's just an expression my pride\n\nYea I get it but it's still for me to admit it sometimes\n\nI get so tired of taking refuge in my own strength\n\nWhile standing with the weight of my insecurities on my back\n\nUntil my bones break\n\nIt won't make a difference to my situation as a whole\n\nWhether I tend to hold it together for the moment\n\nOr pretend to be in control\n\nGod mold me into a man who holds fast to your everlasting hands\n\nGive me the strength that I need to get past my circumstances\n\nGod rescue me make my desperate attempts cause me to confess\n\nMy dependance\n\nAnd may the depths of my weakness make strength perfected\n\n\n\nAlmighty God, omnipotent\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nI am so convinced\n\nYou hold me in my helplessness\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nYou're my confidence\n\nI am so convinced\n\n\n\nAlmighty God\n\nAlmighty, almighty\n\nAlmighty God\n\nAlmighty, almighty, God",
