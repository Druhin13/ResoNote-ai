  "lyrics": "Spend a little too much time together\r\nForgotten how to be all by ourselves\r\nCould be worse, yeah it could be better\r\nStay inside beyond all others\r\nHelp won’t get me out of bed\n\nStop the voices in my head\n\nWaste away with you instead alone, alone\n\n\n\nThe great inside and fortitude\n\nSafely home alone with you\n\nWasting time but what a view you are\n\n\n\nNobody told me when you love someone for real\n\nThat your mind’s on hold and your heart’s behind the wheel\n\n\n\nI'm so caught up with you\n\nSlow love in solitude\n\nDon't eat and we drink too much\n\nFour walls and that one room love\n\n\n\nWe’ll drift away again\n\nYou give me something to numb the pain\n\nWe don't talk and we keep the door shut\n\nWe’re together just a little too much\n\n\n\nI'll lay awake in the middle of the night thinking about home\n\nFeel so alone though I'm with you\n\nNot the same as I used to be\n\nMy friends all lost touch with me\n\nAnd there's nobody to blame but myself\n\n\n\nNobody told me when you love someone for real\n\nThat your mind’s on hold and your heart’s behind the wheel\n\n\n\nI'm so caught up with you\n\nSlow love in solitude\n\nDon't eat and we drink too much\n\nFour walls and that one room love\n\n\n\nWe’ll drift away again\n\nYou give me something to numb the pain\n\nWe don't talk and we keep the door shut\n\nWe’re together just a little too much\n\n\n\nI'm so caught up with you\n\nSlow love in solitude\n\nDon't eat and we drink too much\n\nFour walls and that one room love\n\n\n\nWe’ll drift away again\n\nYou give me something to numb the pain\n\nWe don't talk and we keep the door shut\n\nWe’re together just a little too much\n\n\n\nWe’re together just a little too much\n\nWe’re together just a little too much",
