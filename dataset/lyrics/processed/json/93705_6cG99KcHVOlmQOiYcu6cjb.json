  "lyrics": "If I never come through\r\nYes it haunts me\r\nSunny days I'd miss you\r\nYes it haunts me\r\nFirst you see it, then you feel it, now I'm caught\n\nAnd we're making our own thing\n\nNow I'm following you out to the coast\n\nIf I never come through\n\nIf I never come through\n\n\n\nDon't tell me I lost a step\n\nCriss-crossed in the wrong direction\n\nFound myself in a conversation\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\nStanding there in a purple dress\n\nPoint my eyes in the right direction\n\nFind myself in a conversation\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\n\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\n\n\nI lost myself in this maze\n\nYes it haunts me\n\nFelt it slipping sideways\n\nYes it haunts me\n\n\n\nBut I see it and I feel it in my soul\n\nIs there something I'm missing?\n\nShould I follow this where ever it goes?\n\nI will always come through\n\nI will always come through\n\n\n\nDon't tell me I lost a step\n\nCriss-crossed in the wrong direction\n\nFound myself in a conversation\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\nStanding there in a purple dress\n\nPoint my eyes in the right direction\n\nFind myself in a conversation\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\n\n\nOnly as alone as I want to be\n\nPassing all the people standing on the street\n\nThe fallen fruit of a family tree\n\nA crystal ball and the odyssey\n\nDid you find whatever you were looking for?\n\nHad to open every single door\n\nI get the feeling you've been here before\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\n\n\nDon't tell me I lost a step\n\nCriss-crossed in the wrong direction\n\nFound myself in a conversation\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\nStanding there in a purple dress\n\nPoint my eyes in the right direction\n\nFind myself in a conversation\n\nFrom a missed connection\n\n\n\nAnd they're falling to see it\n\nWe'd be fools to waste it but we can\n\nFalling to feel the heat again\n\nTo feel the heat again\n\nFrom a missed connection",
