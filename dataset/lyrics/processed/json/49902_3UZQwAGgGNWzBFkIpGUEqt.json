  "lyrics": "It was in a living dream\r\nSmooth like sculpted ice\r\nA spirit guide appeared\r\nBefore my eyes\r\nFrozen underneath the mask\n\nI wanted it to last\n\nKeeping the seas so low\n\nAnd all the creatures here below\n\n\n\nWith the sweetest kiss\n\nOne I've never known\n\nCouldn't make sense\n\nIn this sphere alone\n\n\n\nIt's scientifically\n\n[?] by the trees\n\nBut the balance has been tipped\n\nContract's been ripped\n\n\n\nRise with me\n\nRise with me\n\nRise with me\n\nRise with me\n\nRise with me",
