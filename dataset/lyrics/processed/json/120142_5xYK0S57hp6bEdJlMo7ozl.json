  "lyrics": "I feel it through my shoes\r\nThey used to call that the blues\r\nNow they call it depression\r\nEverywhere I go\r\nYes I get to feel so low\n\nIf I got depression\n\n\n\nMy wife don't want no part of me\n\nAnd yes that fact is hard on me\n\nThat's true\n\nI give the doctor a description\n\nAnd he just writes a prescription\n\nOr two\n\n\n\nPeace and quiet were here before\n\nBut they both walked out the door\n\nAnd left me with depression\n\n\n\nI hardly leave my room\n\nMost days I sleep 'till noon\n\nIf I got depression\n\n\n\nMost folks think I'm fine\n\nBut the truth is I'm suprised\n\nI've got depression\n\n\n\nTo all those girls I've loved before\n\nI'm sorry I love this one more\n\nThat's true\n\nIf she would just stay with me\n\nHer presence can only lift me\n\nAnd get me through\n\n\n\nI start to come around\n\nAnd stop putting myself down\n\nThat's called progression",
