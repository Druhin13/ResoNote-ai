  "lyrics": "Oh na na, marijuana\r\nOh na na, smoke the ganja\r\nFrom them hills we go, lookin' for another high, bless my soul\r\nIf I get too high, let me go\r\nThen I wanna fly like an eagle, yo\n\nI'm wanna run through those trees, choppin' 'em all down, burn it, the breeze\n\nAnd I'm at so much ease, feel like I'm floatin' on the ocean\n\nPlease don't fuck up my high\n\nChillin' in the zone, in the dreams with my eyes shut\n\nWrap this joint so tight, [?] with my own type of lighter, what?\n\nDon't ask for a hit\n\nBe careful what you ask for, you might get it\n\nWanna try my shit? Only connoisseurs can hang when I split it\n\n\n\nOh na na, marijuana\n\nOh na na, smoke the ganja\n\nOh na na, marijuana\n\nOh na na, smoke the ganja\n\n\n\nOh na na\n\nI smoke the [?], it make me go loco\n\nI like the marijuana and I blaze up the ganja\n\nOh na na\n\n\n\n[?] stay in this lane, bitches better keep up or they gonna miss a train\n\nYou might try in vain, you ain't gonna make it to the station\n\nFor all y'all missin', I'm wishin' you could [?] for the weed we dishin' out\n\nI make shit simple, we smoked all the most potent weed for the temple\n\nThere ain't no example, here we cultivate for the mind and the mental\n\nJust breathe that in\n\nListen, I don't even know where to begin\n\nYou feel that urge?\n\nLike a shock through the body and you gonna feel the surge\n\nThis shit is [?], I got too much room and my lifes all swerved [?]\n\n\n\nOh na na, marijuana\n\nOh na na, smoke the ganja\n\nOh na na, marijuana\n\nOh na na, smoke the ganja",
