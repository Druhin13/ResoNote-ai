  "lyrics": "It's coming all apart babe\r\nWith every tearing word\r\nI've lost my taste for what I take from you\r\nWhen a painful night of silence\r\nIs the sweetest sound I've heard\r\nIf I play your game I'm cheating on the truth\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\nIt takes too many tears to make love strong\n\nToo much of me for me and you to get along\n\nI'd need another lifetime but I'll never last that long\n\nIt takes too many tears to make love strong\n\n\n\nIt takes a lot of living\n\nA lot of going through\n\nTo finally see and end to going down\n\nThere's no getting up my courage\n\nFor making up with you\n\n'Cause making up just finds another round\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus x 2)",
