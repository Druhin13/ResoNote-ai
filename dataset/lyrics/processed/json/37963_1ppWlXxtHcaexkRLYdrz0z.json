  "lyrics": "It was awkward like F minor the first time I saw you naked\r\nThought you found Jesus in me while I lied there faking\r\nYou told your mama I was coming late again again again again\r\nMy brain has a mind of its own, I don't know which way it goes\r\nParty humor, be my human, be my savior, laugh at my jokes, I've been on good behavior\n\nMay seem filthy, sister calls me little brother, dirty dancing is my Mexico fun\n\nI'm a dyke, dated guys, ain't a crime, won't apologize for my tribe\n\n\n\nYou should let me cut your hair to make you look a little better\n\nThey'll be barking up your tree Mary, Allison, and Heather\n\nOh be my friend or hate my guts, it doesn't matter, we're all fucked\n\nMy brain has a mind of its own, I don't know which way it goes\n\nI was California dreaming, American dream's deceiving, East coast leaving, weekend heathen\n\nContemplation, admiration, salivation, masturbation, four-step Friday night\n\nI'm a dyke, dated guys, ain't a crime, won't apologize for my tribe\n\n\n\nI ain't the man I could have been on the East Coast\n\nI ain't the man I should have been on the East Coast\n\nI am the man I could have been on the East Coast\n\nI ain't the man I should have been on the East Coast\n\n\n\nI am the man I could've been\n\nBurned bridge builder, got thrown off kilter, brightened up my filter, so I wouldn't kill her, or be sadistic, by those ballistic, or become a statistic!\n\nI'm a dyke, dated guys, ain't a crime, won't apologize for my tribe",
