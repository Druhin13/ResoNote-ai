  "lyrics": "The windmills of your mind\r\nThe windows in the night wide open\r\nA jet black summer sky\r\nA setback in my life, I'm hopeless\r\nThat glimmer in your eye\r\nLike Paris in July\n\nI notice, yeah\n\nAnd the streets all come alive\n\n\n\nI’m floating away\n\nOver the car lights\n\nI'm floating away\n\nGlowing in starlight, yeah\n\n\n\nMy friends all wonder why\n\nYet no one takes the time\n\nTo ask me any questions\n\nI read between the lines\n\nOf symbols in the sky\n\nI'm happy, any questions?\n\nI leave this world behind\n\nAs I ascend a moonbeam pathway, yeah\n\nAnd the streets all come alive\n\n\n\nI’m floating away\n\nOver the car lights\n\nI'm floating away\n\nGlowing in starlight\n\nTime will not let me stay\n\nStaying up all night, all night\n\nGlowing in starlight, alright\n\nStarjumper comes alive\n\n\n\nOh, there was dancing in the streets\n\nJust like how we used to be\n\nFaces smiling up at me\n\nNow I'm free\n\n\n\nI'm floating away\n\nOver the car lights\n\nI'm floating away\n\nGlowing in starlight\n\nTime will not let me stay\n\nStaying up all night, all night\n\nGlowing in starlight, alright\n\nStarjumper comes alive\n\n\n\nStaying up all night\n\nAll night, all night, yeah\n\nGlowing in starlight, alright\n\nStarjumper comes alive",
