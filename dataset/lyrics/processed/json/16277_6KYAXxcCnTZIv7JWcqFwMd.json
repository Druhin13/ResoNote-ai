  "lyrics": "Can I ever love again?\r\nCan I ever love again?\r\nCan I ever love again?\r\nLike we did in the meadow\r\nI've been ready before today\r\nIt's just a drop or two away\n\nLet my body rise\n\nSo you can play tricks with my mind\n\n\n\nI keep thinking too much, you're not thinking enough\n\n(Can you help me? Can you help me?)\n\nYou got a funny way of tricking my memories\n\n(Take it from me! Oh, take it from me!)\n\nCause it only takes my shadow to put me on the floor\n\n(With my lady)\n\nShow me what I'm waiting for\n\n\n\nAs my mind drifts closer to the water\n\nWhen will you appear?\n\nI've been waiting all day long\n\nFor you to come sit over here\n\n\n\nBut all the work has been keepin' me hollow\n\n(Can you help me? Can you help me?)\n\nOh yeah, I think the sun is workin' fresh until tomorrow\n\n(Follow it down! Oh, follow it down!)\n\nYou got my place it's as thin as the walls and the ceiling\n\n(Can you help me? Can you help me?)\n\nAh girl, I live so simple, such a glorified feeling\n\n(Follow it down! Oh, follow it down!)\n\n\n\nCause every time I'm tired\n\nI hear him wheeling through the trees and the wind\n\nAs he watches over me and sings\n\n(Yeah it sings!)\n\nYeah it sings\n\n(Yeah it sings!)\n\nOh, it's singin\n\nI look up\n\nAll my pain's just brought me closer to fear\n\nGive me a couple watts to ring in my ear\n\n(In my ear!)\n\nIn my ear\n\n(In my ear!)\n\nIn my ear",
