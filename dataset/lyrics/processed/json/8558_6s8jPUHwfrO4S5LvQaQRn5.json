  "lyrics": "Every morning early risers\r\nSneak into my room and open my eyelids\r\nAnd why is that still a surprise to me?\r\nMaybe ‘cause the night before was bottoms up with the bottle\r\nAnd maybe some more but it really seemed like a good idea\r\nAnd they won't accept the argument that a little more sleep is time well spent\n\nI think that's what I thought I meant to say\n\nI'm a little banged up and I gotta admit that's my own fault\n\nThat I feel like shit but that doesn’t mean I’ll quit on you today\n\nSo now you got me on my feet\n\nAnd I know that you're not gonna listen to me but\n\nI was never good at being patient when I should’ve\n\nAnd even though you make the whole complete\n\nI can’t wait till I finally put you back to sleep but\n\nWe both know how this one goes yeah I don't think no I don't suppose that there\n\nAin't no conversations or any renegotiations\n\nI can't call in sick and just lay here on the floor\n\nIf I learned a thing from past mistakes\n\nThen why did I stay out so late\n\nWhen morning comes in screaming through the door",
