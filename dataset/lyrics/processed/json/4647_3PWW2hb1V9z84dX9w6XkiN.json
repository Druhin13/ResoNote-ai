  "lyrics": "Today, I climb the highest mountain I have ever climbed\r\nAnd I turn, to look at ruins I had left behind\r\nAnd you, where were you so far removed from any truth\r\nI lost you\r\nDidn't I?\r\nFirst I think I lost myself\n\n\n\nChildren\n\nThen and forever locked in a memory\n\nHoldin'\n\nThat mirror searching for some kind of certainty\n\nThat you were just the same as everyone\n\nBut you were wrong\n\nAnd it hurt you\n\nDidn't it?\n\nAll you couldn't be\n\n\n\nRuins\n\nOhhh\n\nRuins\n\nOhhh\n\n\n\nI tried to hold on to some kind of dignity\n\nToo long I waded through a vast and endless sea\n\nThinking, I could find the secret there within\n\nBut I gave up, didn't I?\n\nIt seemed the only way\n\n\n\nRuins\n\nAll the things we built assured that they would last\n\nEnding months ticket stubs, and written notes and photographs\n\nWhere are you and here somewhere I cannot go\n\nI'm sorry\n\nI am\n\nBut I don't take it back\n\nAnd in the night I hear your voice\n\nSometimes but it quickly passes\n\nIn dreams I saw what I had thought\n\nCould be some kind of answer\n\nYou try and try and try until you cannot try no more\n\nCaptured in our own\n\n\n\nRuins\n\nOhhh\n\nRuins\n\nOhhh\n\nRuins",
