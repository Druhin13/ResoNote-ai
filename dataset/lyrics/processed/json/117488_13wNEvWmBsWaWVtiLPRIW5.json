  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Hurt You par The Weeknd\r\nAnd now I know relationship's my enemy\nSo stay away from me\nI'm warning you\nYou try to fill the void with every man you meet\n'Cause you're upset with me\nI'm warning you\n\n'Cause all the nights you slept alone dryin' your eyes\nAnd all the nights you thought about takin' your life\n'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time\nBut if you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight\n\nI don't wanna hurt you\n\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\n\nWhen you're with him, you close your eyes and think of me\nJust call me up again\nI'll make you weak\nGirl, I'll come to put myself between your lips\nNot between your heart\nCan't you see?\n\nThat all the nights we slept alone, dryin' your eyes ('cause of me, baby)\nAnd all the nights you thought about takin' your life ('cause of me, baby)\n'Cause if it's love you want again, don't waste your time (don't you waste)\n\nIf you call me up, I'm fuckin' you on sight\n\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\nI don't wanna hurt you\n\nI don't want\nI don't want\nI don't want\nI don't want\nI don't wanna, baby\nI don't wanna, baby\nI don't",
