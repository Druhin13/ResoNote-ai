  "lyrics": "It all stems from the disappointment\r\nThat you couldn't produce something better than this\r\nThe hurt spreads like an infection\r\nDraining all of the confidence\r\nBut I don't hate my children\r\nI'm always proud of them\r\nI just need to abuse the power\r\nI just can't fucking let them win\r\nSo I'm coming to hunt you\r\nAnd I'm looking to keep the things I kill\r\nI'm just trying to find out\r\nHow far I can push you against your will\r\nWhat a sick little stage we dance on\r\nFeigning some sort of discipline\r\nJust to see who can suck it faster\r\nWho can repurpose the fear within\r\nI wanna watch it destroy you\r\nBut I know that's the easy way to win\r\nSo I'll keep playing the pieces\r\nWhile you're cutting faces and wearing our skin\r\nI know it's gonna destroy you\r\nHow they are all judging you deep beneath your sins\r\nBack into a corner\r\nYou have to face it\r\nI'm coming to hunt you\r\nAnd I'm looking to keep the things I kill\r\nI'm just trying to find out\r\nHow far I can push you against your will\r\nI wanna destroy you\r\nI'm judging you deep beneath your skin\r\nI'm eating the heart out\r\nJust playing the pieces I've been given\r\nI'm coming to hurt",
