  "lyrics": "Every morning you wake up and you're reaching out for me\r\nFound you someone you could have just temporarily\r\nAnd everything you wanted, I knew every part about you\r\nFrom your head to your toes, from your heart to your soul\r\nAnd I don't wanna know\n\nSo why you gotta be that honest for?\n\nI ain't hold your heart no more\n\nWhy you gotta make me insecure?\n\n\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nI don't wanna know now\n\nWho's loving you? Who's touching you?\n\nI don't wanna know now\n\nWho's texting you? (Goddamn)\n\nI do, I do, I don't, I don't\n\nI don't wanna know now\n\n\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nWho's touching you?\n\nWho's touching you?\n\nWho's loving you, you?\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nWho's touching you?\n\nWho's texting you?\n\nWho's sexting you?\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nI don't wanna know\n\n\n\nEvery morning I wake up a little richer, a little more alone\n\nHe got spots to find on his own, I found so long ago\n\nWhy can't I cry no more?\n\nWhy you gotta be so insecure?\n\n\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nI don't wanna know now\n\nWho's loving you? Who's touching you?\n\nI don't wanna know now\n\nWho's texting you? (Goddamn)\n\nI do, I do, I don't, I don't\n\nI don't wanna know now (who's loving you?)\n\n\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nWho's touching you?\n\nWho's love you, you?\n\nI don't wanna know\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nWho's touching you?\n\nWho's texting you?\n\nWho's sexting you?\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nWho's touching you?\n\nWho's texting you?\n\nWho's sexting you?\n\nWho's loving you?\n\nI don't wanna know\n\nI don't wanna know\n\n(Who's loving you?)\n\n\n\nI ain't hold your heart no more\n\nWhy you gotta be so insecure?\n\nHope you don't cry no more\n\nWhy you gotta be so insecure?\n\nWho's loving you?",
