Was it treating you right?\nI wish that I could be there but I'm\nUnder the bad, bad moon tonight\nBaby, can you help me?\n\nLet me out, I'm trapped in a blur\nStarted out the way I wanted but it's weird now\nLet me out, I'm lost in the words\n\nToo much in my head, I shoulda seen the bad sides\nI wanna tell you everything will be fine\nBut I'm afraid that it's a waste of your time\nLet me out, I'm lost in the words\nDon't know how I ended here\nTrapped in a blur\n\nHey!\nOh\nOh\nHey!\nOh\n\nWe're in the [?] age of time\nBaby, can I ask you?\nHow do you fit it all in your mind?\n'Cause I can't seem to\nYeah, they keep dancing to it on and on\n\nBut they don't understand the song\nUnder the bad, bad moon tonight\nI just need to come clean\n\nLet me out, I'm trapped in a blur\nStarted out the way I wanted but it's weird now\nLet me out, I'm lost in the words\nToo much in my head, I shoulda seen the bad sides\nI wanna tell you everything will be fine\nBut I'm afraid that it's a waste of your time\nLet me out, I'm lost in the words\nDon't know how I ended here\nTrapped in a blur\n\nHey!\nWoo!\nHey!\nTrapped in a blur\n\nHey!\nTrapped in a blur\nOh\nOh\nHey!\nOh\nWoah\n\nLet me out, I'm trapped in a blur\nStarted out the way I wanted but it's weird now\nLet me out, I'm lost in the words\nDon't know how I ended here\nTrapped in a blur",
