  "lyrics": "Your friends are in town\r\nThey want me to go out\r\nSo I'll go but just so you can see them\r\nCold cups of coffee where you sit across me\r\nAnd I wonder if you know how I'm feeling\n\nI'll hide it if it helps\n\nKeeping you from someone else\n\n'Cause it's hard to save yourself if you're alone\n\nI can hold you in the dark\n\nEven though I fall apart\n\nDoesn't have to feel so hard to feel so low\n\n\n\nSo I'm smiling through my teeth\n\nSay things I don't mean\n\nIf that's what you need, If it helps you sleep\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI might lie awake next to you and think\n\nThere just ain't enough love for both of us but\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\n\n\nI'm holding onto an old me and old you\n\nAnd hoping we'll become what it used to be\n\nYou want me to want you and trust me, I want to\n\nSo meet me in the middle where I'm still tryna figure it out\n\n\n\nI'll hide it if it helps\n\nKeeping you from someone else\n\n'Cause it's hard to save yourself if you're alone\n\nI can hold you in the dark\n\nEven though we'll fall apart\n\nDoesn't have to feel so hard to feel so low\n\n\n\nSo I'm smiling through my teeth\n\nSay things I don't mean\n\nIf that's what you need, If it helps you sleep\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI might lie awake next to you and think\n\nThere just ain't enough love for both of us but\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\n\n\nSo I'm smiling through my teeth\n\nSay things I don't mean\n\nIf that's what you need, If it helps you sleep\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI might lie awake next to you and think\n\nThere just ain't enough love for both of us but\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it\n\nI could fake it, I could fake it",
