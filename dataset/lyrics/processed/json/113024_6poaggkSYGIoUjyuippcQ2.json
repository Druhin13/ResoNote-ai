  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Northern Soul par Above & Beyond\r\nMidnight, moonlight\nThe wind blows off St. Clair\nI'm stuck at a red light, waiting\nAt 6 Mile and Delaware\nThe sound of a distant Firebird\nThe echo of a rhyme in Smokey's words\nAnd absence, sweet absence\nFills the freezing air\n\nI've been wayside for years now\nBut no-one seems to care\nTheir eyes on a distant horizon\nI drove them out of here\nI gave you the American dream\nAnd the music for your movie scene\nBut you left me, bleeding\n\nSo listen to my prayer\n\nYou can break my heart and crush my dreams\nBut you can never take my soul\nYou can crack my stones and melt my steel\nBut you can never take my soul\nYou can break my heart and crush my dreams\nBut you can never take my soul\nYou can crack my stones and melt my steel\nBut you can never take my soul\n\nYou can never take my soul\nYou can never take my soul\nYou can never take my soul\nMmm, you can never take my soul\nYou can never take my soul\nYou can never take my soul\n\n\nYou can break my heart and crush my dreams\nBut you can never take my soul\nYou can crack my stones and melt my steel\nBut you can never take my soul\nYou can break my heart and crush my dreams\nBut you can never take my soul\nYou can crack my stones and melt my steel\nBut you can never take my soul",
