  "lyrics": "What am I supposed to do without you?\r\nIs it too late to pick the pieces up?\r\nToo soon to let them go?\r\nDo you feel damaged just like I do?\r\nYour face, it makes my body ache\r\nIt won't leave me alone\n\n\n\nAnd this feels like drowning\n\nTrouble sleeping\n\nRestless dreaming\n\n\n\nYou're in my head\n\nAlways, always\n\nI just got scared\n\nAway, away\n\nI'd rather choke on my bad decisions\n\nThen just carry them to my grave\n\nYou're in my head\n\nAlways, always, always\n\n\n\nCracks won't fix and the scars won't fade away\n\nGuess I should get used to this\n\nThe left side of my bed's an empty space\n\nI remember we were strangers\n\nSo tell me what's the difference\n\nBetween then and now\n\n\n\nAnd why does this feel like drowning?\n\nTrouble sleeping\n\nRestless dreaming\n\n\n\nYou're in my head\n\nAlways, always\n\nI just got scared\n\nAway, away\n\nI'd rather choke on my bad decisions\n\nThen just carry them to my grave\n\nYou're in my head\n\nAlways, always, always\n\nAlways, always\n\n\n\nYou're in my head\n\nAlways, always\n\nI just got scared\n\nAlways, Always\n\nI know there's nothing left to cling to\n\nBut I'm still calling out your name\n\nYou're in my head\n\nAlways, always, always\n\n\n\nAlways, always, always",
