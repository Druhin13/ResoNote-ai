  "lyrics": "Come get me, but don't hit me\r\nI smoke weed, so I'm trippy\r\nGet litty, get gritty\r\nRick Sanchez, get schwifty\r\nWho gonna come to come to get me?\n\nWho gonna break me out, set me free?\n\nWho gonna come to, come to get me now?\n\nWho gonna come to, come to get me? (Woo)\n\nI'm sexy, I'm gifted\n\nI'm too high to get lifted\n\nYou're racist, you're evil\n\nYou're a danger to my people\n\n\n\nMy vision is faded, my brain has calculated\n\nHow many licks to lick your lemon drop?\n\nHow many licks to lick your drop, drop?\n\nPave the way for me to set you free\n\nPave the way for me to set you free\n\n\n\nYou know I'm tryna make it, but I only got time\n\nNever graduated, so I never had a prom\n\nAlcoholic, so I never really had a mom\n\nDon't feel bad 'cause I turned out fine\n\nIf you really 'bout it, come and step up to the line\n\nI'm a bad mama jama, now watch me shine\n\nOnly 27, I'm ahead of my prime\n\nIf it's illegal to kill the pussy, book me with a crime\n\nMy spaceship is empty\n\nDolla, dolla bill, y'all, Bobby got plenty\n\nHere's a glass of shut the fuck up, it's venti\n\nWhy's everybody so uptight this century?\n\nIf you a crybaby bitch, I'ma fuck yo' mom\n\nGood thing for me that the cougar is a dime\n\nDon't believe in Jesus, but I think this is the time\n\nI'ma have to come back and kill it one time\n\n\n\nMy vision is faded, my brain has calculated\n\nHow many licks to lick your lemon drop?\n\nHow many licks to lick your drop, drop?\n\nPave the way for me to set you free\n\nPave the way for me to set you free",
