  "lyrics": "Look at the stars above, what do you know?\r\nWhat is this life about, where do we go?\r\nWe ́re only here for such a little piece of time\r\nLook at the world and tell me what you see\r\nThere is a place that ́s made for you and me\r\nIn the eternal space somewhere along the line\n\n\n\nAnd I burn\n\nI burn\n\nFor you\n\n\n\nI was a child, I was so innocent\n\nThen I grew older tried to understand\n\nI've lost my faith and suddenly I needed proof\n\nThe more I tried to find the reason why\n\nThe less I knew myself was blinded by\n\nSo many answers that were trying to explain\n\n\n\nAnd I burn\n\nI burn\n\nAnd I burn forever for you\n\n\n\nI close my eyes, I feel\n\nYou ́ve fanned the flame in me\n\nAll we need is what we are\n\nOur life has just begun\n\nWe shine as long as every star\n\nIn the empire of the sun\n\n\n\nAnd I burn\n\nI burn\n\nAnd I burn forever and ever\n\nAnd I burn\n\nYou light up my life\n\nAnd I burn\n\nI Promise I burn for you You light up my life\n\nI Promise I burn forever for you",
