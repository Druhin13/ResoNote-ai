  "lyrics": "I used to be afraid to sleep out underneath the stars\r\nBut now I embrace the loneliness of ancient Gods\r\nLord knows I know what it's like to lack a purpose\r\nI've waited everyday hoping for a moment\r\nEveryone I love is always far away from me\n\n(Can't you see)\n\nEveryone I love is always far away from me\n\n\n\nI fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes\n\nEveryone is telling me that I'm never going to make it out of here alive\n\nGoddamn the oceans that spread between our lives\n\nEveryone is telling me that I better runaway if I want to survive\n\n\n\nI used to be afraid to walk alone out in the dark\n\nNow I embrace the emptiness that's in my heart\n\nHeaven knows I'm waiting for death to come and take me\n\nI'd rather be with you than alone with those who made me\n\n\n\nEveryone I love is always far away from me\n\n(Can't you see)\n\nEveryone I love is always far away from me\n\n\n\nI fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes\n\nEveryone is telling me that I'm never going to make it out of here alive\n\nGoddamn the oceans that spread between our lives\n\nEveryone is telling me that I better runaway if I want to survive\n\n\n\nI don't need anyone to tell me\n\nYou're the only thing I have left\n\nEveryone in my life has faded\n\nPlease tell me this isn't it\n\nEveryone in my life has left me\n\nEveryday is another test\n\nTo see if I can take this stress\n\nWithout it driving me to drink\n\n\n\nBecause I'd rather find another way\n\n\n\nI fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes\n\nEveryone is telling me that I'm never going to make it out of here alive\n\nGoddamn the oceans that spread between our lives\n\nEveryone is telling me that I better runaway if I want to survive\n\n\n\nI fell into your arms and I fell into your bright eyes\n\nEveryone is telling me that I'm never going to make it out of here alive",
