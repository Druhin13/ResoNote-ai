  "lyrics": "You’ll see me walking in the streets at night\r\nJust following the sound of my lonely feet\r\nI’m relinquishing of all control\r\nMy mind’s in tactical retreat\r\nI doubt you even live here still\n\nBut it quickens up the pace of my heartbeat\n\nWhen I find myself by accident\n\nOn 22nd Street\n\n\n\nAll the years, since bittersweet\n\nAre chapters in a story book\n\nThat still is incomplete\n\nThe falling leaves will tumble to defeat\n\nBut nothing’s ever changed round here\n\nOn 22nd Street\n\n\n\nEvery time I’m at the spot I remember\n\n22nd was the place I met the girl of dreams\n\nA bright sunny day in November\n\nSuch a beautiful sight staring right back at me\n\n\n\nTo get yuh body was my goal\n\nBut yuh fit perfectly ina di wifey roll\n\nYuh have mi unda control\n\nOn 22nd Street weh yuh capture mi heart and soul\n\n\n\nI have a dream that I can’t shake\n\nA dream where lonely lovers meet\n\nOn the corner of the avenue\n\nAnd 22nd Street\n\n\n\nThe street musicians start to play\n\nTheir violins so sweet\n\nWe can’t help ourselves but dance\n\nThese steps we must complete\n\n\n\nAll the years, since bittersweet\n\nAre chapters in a fairy tale\n\nThat still lies incomplete\n\nThe falling leaves are destined to repeat\n\nThat nothing’s ever changed round here\n\nOn 22nd Street\n\n\n\nWell any time I walk the spot I remember\n\n22nd was the place I met the girl of dreams\n\nA bright sunny day in November\n\nSuch a beautiful sight staring right back at me\n\n\n\nI couldn’t leave you alone\n\nSomething inside told me I’m gonna make you my own\n\nI had you locked in my zone\n\nYou are the queen of my life and the heir to my throne\n\n\n\nAll the years, since bittersweet\n\nAre chapters in a fairy tale\n\nThat still lies incomplete\n\nThe falling leaves will tumble to defeat\n\nI find myself alone again\n\nOn 22nd Street",
