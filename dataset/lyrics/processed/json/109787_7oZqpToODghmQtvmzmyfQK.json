(I-I, want to be)\n\nFearless! (I-I, want to be)\n\n\n\nThese mountains, these giants\n\nWill fall at a single Word\n\nIn Your Name, in Your strength\n\nI'm more than a conqueror\n\n\n\nI wasn't given the spirit of fear (no-no)\n\nI was given the power of love (the power of love)\n\nEverything I've been fighting against\n\nI'm gonna lift it up\n\n\n\nI wanna be fearless!\n\nNo holding back, no backing down\n\nFearless!\n\nBecause I believe, You're with me now\n\nBring on the unknown\n\nLead me and I'll go\n\nCome set me free\n\nGod, I want to be\n\nFearless!
