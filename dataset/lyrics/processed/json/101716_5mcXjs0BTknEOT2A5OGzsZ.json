  "lyrics": "And through it all, we wore the pain\r\nWe held our own\r\nThrough the darkest of our nights\r\nIt’s written in my blood\r\nIt’s carved into my soul\r\nThrough the darkest of our nights\n\n\n\nBecause if you couldn’t stop us then\n\nWhat hope do you have now\n\nWhen you dragged us though the fire\n\nDid you really think that we would burn\n\n\n\nWe’re no saviors\n\nWe’re no saints\n\nWe’re no martyrs\n\nAnd we don’t need saving\n\nI’ve come too far to turn back\n\nI’ve seen too much to play dead\n\nIf this is all you got then take a deep breath in\n\nAs I drown you out\n\n\n\nI’m on the edge, I’m leaning out\n\nBut I can’t see the sorrow for the pain\n\nIt’s written in my blood\n\nIt’s carved into my soul\n\nThe sorrow and the pain\n\n\n\nSo, you think you know the story\n\nDid you read it in the scars\n\nBecause when you threw us to the lions\n\nDid you really think that we would run\n\n\n\nWe’re no saviors\n\nWe’re no saints\n\nWe’re no martyrs\n\nAnd we don’t need saving\n\nI’ve come too far to turn back\n\nI’ve seen too much to play dead\n\nIf this is all you got then take a deep breath in\n\n\n\nDon’t mistake composure\n\nFor weakness\n\nDon’t mistake my silence\n\nFor respect\n\nDon’t mistake composure for weakness\n\nDon’t mistake my silence for respect\n\nI’ll burn your world to the ground then spit on the ashes\n\n\n\nScorched fucking earth\n\n\n\nAs I drown you out\n\n\n\nI’ve come too far to turn back\n\nI’ve seen too much to play dead\n\nIf this is all you got then take a deep breath in",
