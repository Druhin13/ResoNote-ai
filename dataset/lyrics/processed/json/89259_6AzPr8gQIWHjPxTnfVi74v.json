  "lyrics": "Have you all of my lifetime\r\nKinda hard to make light\r\nImagining when you were inside\r\nWhen you made those kicks at night\r\nDon't wanna hurt you\n\nDon't wanna run away from myself\n\nWant your whole star to shine on in\n\nOne star, one light\n\nThe meaning of life\n\n\n\nYou won't let me go astray\n\nYou will let me find my way\n\n\n\nFind a way to stand\n\nAnd a time to walk away\n\nLetting go to let you lead\n\nI don't know how it ends\n\n\n\nComes a time when you answer\n\nDo it with heart\n\nWon't you express yourself\n\nNot let it get to your head?\n\n\n\nYou won't let me go astray\n\nYou will let me find my way\n\nYou, you led me the way\n\nYou stay",
