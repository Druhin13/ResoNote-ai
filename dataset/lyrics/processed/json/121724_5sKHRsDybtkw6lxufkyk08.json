  "lyrics": "There was a time when I tried to hold\r\nThe ocean in my fists\r\nWhen I mistook the language for the light\r\nThere was a tightness that gripped my soul\r\nAnd bubbled at my wrists\r\nAnd choked me within inches of my life\n\n\n\nBut now I'm letting go\n\nAnd I can finally breathe\n\nI can finally breathe\n\n\n\nAnd my hands are open, reaching out\n\nI'm learning how to live with doubt\n\nI'm learning how to lean into the grey\n\n'Cause I've had enough of black and white\n\nI'll find another way and I will\n\nLean into the grey\n\nLean into the grey\n\n\n\nThere was a time when I tried to bind\n\nAnd bottle up the sea\n\nI tried to hide my heart inside my head\n\nThere was a maze of these vicious lines\n\nThat cut through everything\n\nI pulled against them till my body bled\n\n\n\nBut now I'm letting go\n\nAnd I can finally breathe\n\nI can finally breathe\n\n\n\nAnd my hands are open, reaching out\n\nI'm learning how to live with doubt\n\nI'm learning how to lean into the grey\n\n'Cause I've had enough of black and white\n\nI'll find another way and I will\n\nLean into the grey\n\nLean into the grey\n\n\n\nI will find\n\nI will find another way\n\nWay\n\nAnd I will lean\n\nI will lean into the grey\n\nGrey\n\n\n\nNow I'm letting go\n\nAnd I can finally breathe\n\nI can finally breathe\n\n\n\nAnd my hands are open, reaching out\n\nI'm learning how to live with doubt\n\nI'm learning how to lean into the grey\n\n'Cause I've had enough of black and white\n\nI'll find another way and I will\n\nLean into the grey\n\nLean into the grey\n\n\n\nYeah I've had enough of black and white\n\nI'll lean into the grey\n\nI'll lean into the grey\n\nI'll find another way and I\n\nWill lean into the grey\n\nLean into the grey",
