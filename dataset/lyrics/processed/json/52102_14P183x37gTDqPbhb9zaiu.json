  "lyrics": "Why do we need this\r\nWho was it that said great things come to great men\r\nWell that fucker lied to us\r\nThere's nothing here but a wasteland\r\nAnd I can still see the graves of the dead\r\nBut it's useless\n\nMost of us would rather sit\n\nThan see this wound\n\nThat we have created\n\nLets not last the night\n\nI'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy\n\nSenseless and I'm not sure why\n\nI'm not going to pretend that I know all the answers\n\nOr all of the questions\n\nIts got to be good for something\n\nSo we'll chalk this and we'll mount the dead\n\nOn the fireplace above right above our guilded heads\n\nI'm sick and I'm tired of always being the good guy\n\nLike sitting in the back seat\n\nAnd boring me with your body\n\nHow many times can I say I'm sorry\n\nAnd really mean it",
