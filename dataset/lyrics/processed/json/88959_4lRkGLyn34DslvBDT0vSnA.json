  "lyrics": "I’ve been told to be a seer, one must be ruthless\r\nSo, I’ve eaten the yellow text of Paul and Brutus\r\nThe soothsayers came and went, now I believe\r\nTo be reborn, we first must cultivate a seed\r\nOh, spit it out\n\nRelease that precious piece\n\nOf pebbled ash from your mouth\n\nThat’s a working-class jewel\n\nSpinning round your hopeless head\n\nIt ain’t for chewing on\n\nIt’s for looking through instead\n\n\n\nYou prefer the common stone to the pearls\n\nUnder the plexiglass with the factory girl\n\nWho told her sister all about you\n\nHanging bedsheets on the clothesline in the sun\n\n\n\nShe keep you warm, she keep you fed\n\nNow you’ve gone and lost your bed\n\nOn the doorstep of the sick and indignant society\n\n\n\nAnd as Christmas comes\n\nSend word to all the ones\n\nWho watched night disown day\n\n\n\n35 days after defection\n\nI am sat in the cheapest of rooms\n\nThere’s an oil lamp defiantly snapping at the shadows\n\nI’ve had notions to start playing chess\n\nBut the mice, they have stolen the pieces\n\nI have told them to start paying rent or they must leave\n\n\n\nI am writing my letters\n\nI am anchored in an arm chair\n\nI intend on shooting the postman\n\nWhen he passes at dawn\n\n\n\nI haven’t eaten for 13 days\n\nI’ve taken the form of a Bosnian beggar\n\nAnd I’m reason the preachers are screaming and shouting\n\nTell their mother I’m home\n\nTell their mother I’m home\n\n\n\nAnd as Christmas comes\n\nSend word to all the ones\n\nWho would love to be remembered\n\nBy the ghosts of November\n\nOn St. Stephens’s Day\n\nIn some minuscule way\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross my city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\nAcross the city, they’re sending postcards to Catalonia\n\n\n\nI can’t get out now\n\nSo here’s a postcard from Catalonia",
