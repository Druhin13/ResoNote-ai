  "lyrics": "I wasn't higher than I was supposed to be\r\nBut the walls froze through then they shatter\r\nI'm partially peaceful sitting in an empty room\r\nWhile the lights outside never matter\r\nThere's a bitter pill on the other side\r\nSmoky shaded space in a double-wide\n\nWe could come to the middle\n\nLet it all pass through\n\n\n\nI'm a pretender\n\nIt's like being the morning sun\n\nAll the lies I live make me wonder\n\nI had a bottle\n\nFilled it with the only one\n\nThat could turn my nights into thunder\n\nHow I wish it could be another way\n\nAnd I wouldn't stumble and go away\n\nYeah, it makes you cry just a little\n\nIf it does us any good\n\nI cannot see it\n\n\n\nAnd I am shaping a madness\n\n[?] were planned\n\nWhile the world spins faster than ever\n\nAnd they say it's burning\n\nAll the things you need to say\n\nYou better get out now while you're limber\n\nMorning never cuts like I want it to\n\nThere's a canyon in between me and you\n\nAnd I would bleed just a little\n\nAnd never be the same\n\n\n\nWhy am I so tired when all I do is sleep\n\nIs it the same dream that I keep having\n\nYou there with me lying in a naked seat\n\nBut there was ample shelter and padding\n\nBut the wind whispers in a darkened street\n\nSelling simple warnings to you and me\n\nYeah it makes me die just a little\n\nA little every day",
