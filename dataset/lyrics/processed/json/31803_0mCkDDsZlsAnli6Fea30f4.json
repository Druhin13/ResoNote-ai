  "lyrics": "I was feeling ill\r\nFrom sitting still\r\nSo sick of my routine\r\nIn a bungalow\r\nLike a typical teen\n\nI was hoping there'd be more\n\nThen you knocked upon my door\n\nWanting to go\n\nPlaces I never been\n\n\n\nWhat did I know?\n\nReady, let's go\n\n\n\nThere's only so much time\n\nWe can kill here\n\nBefore we start to\n\nSpin our wheels\n\nI've had time to run but\n\nI'm still here\n\nYou can't imagine\n\nHow that feels\n\n\n\nWe talked the talk\n\nBut to walk the walk\n\nIs easier said than done\n\nAnd even though\n\nWe were ready to run\n\n\n\nNever saw the greener grass\n\nNever grabbed the ring of brass\n\nNothing to show\n\nFlying far from the sun\n\n\n\nThat may be true\n\nBut if I've got you\n\n\n\nThere's only so much time\n\nWe can kill here\n\nBefore we start to\n\nSpin our wheels\n\nI've had time to run but\n\nI'm still here\n\nCan you imagine\n\nHow that feels?\n\n\n\nWith your support\n\nI can hold the fort\n\nWhile others leave town\n\n\n\nDon't mind if they go\n\nIf you'll be hanging around\n\n\n\nThere's only so much time\n\nWe can kill here\n\nAnd when we start to\n\nSpin our wheels\n\n\n\nIf I ever need you\n\nYou're right here\n\nYou can't imagine\n\nHow that feels\n\n\n\nWatch us while we\n\nSpin our wheels",
