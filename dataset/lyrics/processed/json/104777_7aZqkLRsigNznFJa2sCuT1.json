That's evidence they shouldn't be passing their genes on\n\nThat was racist, but I'ma run with it\n\nLike every sagging pair of pants-ass that have a gun in it\n\nSo I undid it, like a Singapore with gum in it\n\nDoes that mean if I let you write that I can put my thumbs in it?\n\nUhn—nasty, but let the moment pass, only wave if they ask\n\nAnd catch me at the scene of the crash, karma\n\nThey hate blood like [?], so they hate [?] like an English teacher grades\n\n\n\nBeauty is the largest, obstacles to obsess\n\nDiasporan sonnets, community resistance, and progress\n\n\n\nPeople lovingly exclaim\n\nPeople lovingly exclaim\n\nPeople lovingly exclaim\n\nPeople...\n\n\n\nThe city: population control, occupation parole\n\nHope the [?] persuades and this conversation [?]\n\nNot to be Enron, Alexander Hamilton to Cassandra's Agamemnon\n\nThe environment is more than just a panda at the wind farm\n\nLooks cool but it's bull as cool fusers\n\nAnd the abuse is fueled of duel-losers\n\nTo make fools of the schools and [?]\n\nThe crusade delegislate oxygen\n\nAnd put it in the box just like Desiree Washington\n\nFortune cookie, First Panda excellerate in profiting\n\nHope Santa fill my socks with highly-decorated moccasins\n\nMy, how the roles have reversed\n\nSo now we gotta eat 'em for dessert\n\nBop the kids just to free 'em from the curse\n\nDress up the thots in lingerie and feed 'em to [?] (uh-huh)\n\n\n\nBeauty is the largest, organize the objects\n\nDiasporan sonnets, community resistance, and progress\n\n\n\nDiasporan sonnets, community resistance, and progress\n\nWoah—the people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)\n\nPeople lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)\n\nPeople lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)\n\nCommunity resistance and progress\n\nPe-pe-people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)",
