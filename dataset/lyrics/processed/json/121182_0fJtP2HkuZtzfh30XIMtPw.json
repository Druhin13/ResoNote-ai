  "lyrics": "It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside\r\nI'm not one of those who can easily hide\r\nI don't have much money, but boy if I did\r\nI'd buy a big house where we both could live\r\nIf I was a sculptor, but then again, no\n\nOr a man who makes potions on a traveling show\n\nI know it's not much, but it's the best I can do\n\nMy gift is my song, and this one's for you\n\n\n\nAnd you can tell everybody this is your song\n\nIt may be quite simple, but now that it's done\n\nI hope you don't mind\n\nI hope you don't mind that I put down in words\n\nHow wonderful life is while you're in the world\n\n\n\nI sat on the roof and kicked off the moss\n\nWell, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross\n\nBut the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song\n\nIt's for people like you that keep it turned on\n\n\n\nSo excuse me forgetting, but these things I do\n\nYou see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue\n\nAnyway, the thing is, what I really mean\n\nYours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen\n\n\n\nAnd you can tell everybody this is your song\n\nIt may be quite simple, but now that it's done\n\nI hope you don't mind\n\nI hope you don't mind that I put down in words\n\nHow wonderful life is while you're in the world\n\n\n\nI hope you don't mind\n\nI hope you don't mind that I put down in words\n\nHow wonderful life is while you're in the world",
