  "lyrics": "These days nothing ever feels like home\r\nYou say you're driving down a one way road\r\nIf you see the day only for the night\r\nDo you see the darkness in the middle of the light?\r\nFeel your heart break\r\nYou're not the only one you know\n\n\n\nWhen you find yourself, all on your own\n\nYou'll never walk alone\n\nIn the dead of the night, out in the cold\n\nYou'll never walk alone\n\n\n\nYou'll never walk alone\n\nYou'll never walk alone",
