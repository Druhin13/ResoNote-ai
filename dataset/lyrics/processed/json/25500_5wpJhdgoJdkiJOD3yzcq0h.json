  "lyrics": "I was lost in the lakes\r\nAnd the shapes that your body makes\r\nThat your body makes, that your body makes\r\nThat your body makes\r\nThe mountains said I could find you here\n\nThey whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear\n\nI traced my finger along your trails\n\nYour body was the map, I was lost in it\n\n\n\nFloating over your rocky spine\n\nThe glaciers made you, and now you're mine\n\nFloating over your rocky spine\n\nThe glaciers made you, and now you're mine\n\n\n\nI was moving across your frozen veneer\n\nThe sky was dark but you were clear\n\nCould you feel my footsteps\n\nAnd would you shatter, would you shatter, would you\n\n\n\nAnd with your soft fingers between my claws\n\nLike purity against resolve\n\nI could tell, then and there, that we were formed from the clay\n\nAnd came from the rocks for the earth to display\n\n\n\nThey told me to be careful up there\n\nWhere the wind blows a venomous rage through your hair\n\nThey told me to be careful up there\n\nWhere the wind rages through your hair",
