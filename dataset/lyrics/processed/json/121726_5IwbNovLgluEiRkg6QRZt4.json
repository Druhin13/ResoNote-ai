  "lyrics": "I wanna get closer to where you hide\r\nI wanna see further into your eyes\r\nI wanna go deeper into what you deny\r\nI wanna keep falling until there's no light\r\nI don't fear the dark\n\nShow me all your scars\n\nI wanna know who you are\n\n(I wanna know who you are)\n\nI don't fear the dark\n\nGive me all your heart\n\nI wanna know who you are\n\n\n\nShow me the skeletons in your closet\n\nDon't wanna play pretend all alone\n\nAll of the skeletons, they will haunt us\n\nLet me in, let me in, I want more\n\n\n\nI wanna uncover what nobody knows\n\nWhere all of your secrets are taking control\n\nAll the shadows are beautiful\n\nDon't need to keep hiding, it's time to let go\n\n\n\nI don't fear the dark\n\nShow me all your scars\n\nI wanna know who you are\n\n\n\nShow me the skeletons in your closet\n\nDon't wanna play pretend all alone\n\nAll of the skeletons, they will haunt us\n\nLet me in, let me in, I want more\n\nShow me the skeletons in your closet\n\nDon't wanna play pretend all alone\n\nAll of the skeletons, they will haunt us\n\nLet me in, let me in, I want more\n\n\n\nShow me all your lies\n\nShow me where you hide\n\n\n\nShow me the skeletons in your closet\n\nDon't wanna play pretend all alone\n\nAll of the skeletons, they will haunt us\n\nLet me in, let me in, I want more\n\nShow me the skeletons, show me the skeletons\n\nIn your closet, in your closet\n\nAll of the skeletons, all of the skeletons\n\nLet me in, let me in, I want more",
