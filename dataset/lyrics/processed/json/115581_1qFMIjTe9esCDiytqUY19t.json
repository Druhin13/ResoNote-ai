  "lyrics": "Somebody get me a hammer\r\nWanna break all the clocks and the mirrors\r\nAnd go back to a time that was different\r\nA time when I didn't feel like there was something missing\r\nNow my body and mind are so distant\r\nDon't know how to escape from this prison\n\n\n\nHow can I free my mind?\n\n\n\nCause I can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\nI can't breathe\n\n\n\nHow can I live in the moment\n\nWhen my thoughts never feel like my own and\n\nDon't know how to admit that I'm broke\n\n\n\nHow can I be alright?\n\n\n\nCause I can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\nI can't breathe\n\n\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI can't breathe",
