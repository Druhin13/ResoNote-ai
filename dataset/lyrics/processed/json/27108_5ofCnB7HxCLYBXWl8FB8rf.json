  "lyrics": "So you thought you'd wave goodbye to June and then it's May\r\nYou take a good look around you room, but nothing's changed\r\nYou've been writin' endlessly into a wall\r\nYou just thought if you'd let yourself fall, the answers came\r\nBut it seems all answers are just question-bound\n\nAs the year rolls back around\n\n[?] an ambitious layabout\n\nWon't make his own way out\n\nBut I've asked him to know you're nothing\n\n\n\nThe old lover called me up last week to give me news\n\nShe said she'd given birth to a baby boy, I said \"Good for you\"\n\nShe said \"What worth's life if you don't give life?\" I said \"What it's worth to you\"\n\nShe said \"There's not much evidence that points to that,\" I said \"That may well be true\"\n\n\n\nBut you'll know its worth if your force is well-applied\n\nAnd karma's eye is worth your time\n\nYou may have fallen in another life\n\nBut you'll know it's worth a try if you're still alive\n\n\n\nYou can live in fear of the curtain call but know the game\n\nEvery cookout ends the same: people go home when the food's gone or they raid\n\nBut so preposterous is the thought of this being wonderful when this is all there is\n\nIf this is wonderful, then what's un-wonderful?\n\nIt's like, it's like...\n\n\n\nA mass-projection of what's in your mind\n\nHurtlin' through space and time\n\nIt won't take you long to realize\n\nThat it won't be much to die if you feel alive",
