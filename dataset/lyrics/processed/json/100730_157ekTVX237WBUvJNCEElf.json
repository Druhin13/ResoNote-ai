  "lyrics": "I'm just a phantom in your room\r\nWith no intent on leaving soon\r\nAnd you're still not even sure just how I got here\r\nAnother ghost that's in your bed\r\nThat you wish you could leave for dead\r\nAin't no magic word can make me disappear\n\n\n\nNow that room, it starts to dim\n\nSet the mood for onset sin\n\nAnd now we're passed out on the floor of your apartment\n\nWith every single warning sign\n\nIt passed you up and slipped you by\n\nBut we're all bound to end up back to where we started\n\n\n\nMake no mistake\n\nI'll break you down (Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)\n\nShout it around town\n\n\n\nI'm not what you want\n\nBut I'm exactly what you need\n\nTake a bite and feed\n\nYour satisfaction guaranteed\n\n\n\nI'm your sunshine, whoa\n\nI'm gonna burn down your parade\n\nI'm a shooting star\n\nThat wish you wished you never made\n\n\n\nDon't wanna take a leap of faith\n\nYou wanna do this face to face\n\nAnd like an animal the instincts taken over\n\nThere ain't nothing to debate\n\nBlow this purgatory state\n\nThe city lights will drown you out in the exposure\n\n\n\nNow that room, it starts to dim\n\nSet the mood for onset sin\n\nAnd now we're passed out on the floor of your apartment\n\nWith every single warning sign\n\nIt passed you up and slipped you by\n\nBut we're all bound to end up back to where we started\n\n\n\nMake no mistake\n\nI'll break you down (Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)\n\nShout it around town\n\n\n\nI'm not what you want\n\nBut I'm exactly what you need\n\nTake a bite and feed\n\nYour satisfaction guaranteed\n\n\n\nI'm your sunshine, whoa\n\nI'm gonna burn down your parade\n\nI'm a shooting star\n\nThat wish you wished you never made\n\n\n\nThis world is what you need\n\nWhere the monsters roam and the demons all feed\n\nRelax don't you look so wary\n\nIt's all only temporary\n\n\n\nWe roam and sing along\n\nWhile the choir joins in sing an abhorrent song\n\nWe bite, it's a little bit scary\n\nThe pain's only temporary\n\n\n\nI'm not what you want\n\nBut I'm exactly what you need\n\nTake a bite and feed\n\nYour satisfaction guaranteed\n\n\n\nI'm not what you want\n\nBut I'm exactly what you need\n\nTake a bite and feed\n\nYour satisfaction guaranteed\n\n\n\nI'm your sunshine, whoa\n\nI'm gonna burn down your parade\n\nI'm a shooting star\n\nThat wish you wished you never made\n\nWish you wish you never made",
