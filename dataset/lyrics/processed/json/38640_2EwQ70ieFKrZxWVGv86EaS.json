  "lyrics": "I'm dreaming another life\r\nIt's one I can't hold inside\r\nWon't you meet me out of your head\r\nAnd out of the clouds that we leave behind-ind\r\nI'm dreaming another way\n\nFor me to go day to day\n\nWon't you meet me out of your mind\n\nAnd out of the heart that we leave behind\n\nI'm dreaming another time\n\nA world I can't leave behind\n\nI'm making my own way back\n\nFrom the way that I can't define\n\nI'm dreaming another smile\n\nA road I don't need to discover\n\nAnd when you are out of your mind\n\nAnd out of the clouds that we leave behind-ind\n\n\n\nI'm dreaming another life\n\nIt's one I can't hold inside\n\nWon't you meet me out of your head\n\nAnd out of the clouds that we leave behind-ind\n\n\n\nI'm dreaming another song\n\nOne more chance before it's gone\n\nI'm picturing my old room\n\nAnd the pools I'll leave behind\n\nThe changes are hard to hear\n\nBut I know they hide in here\n\nI'll pull them together soon\n\nSomewhere out of this thick ends\n\n\n\nI'm dreaming another life\n\nIt's one I can't hold inside\n\nWon't you meet me out of your head\n\nAnd out of the clouds that we leave behind-ind\n\nI'm dreaming another life",
