  "lyrics": "Nothing looks familiar out there\r\nBut everything's the same\r\nIt's just the center leaking out\r\nWhile all the trees go up in the flames\r\nAlmost pretty from a distance\r\nBut it's hot beyond the glass\n\nWhen the window breaks you'll feel it\n\nAnd that thought might be the last\n\n\n\nBreak the glass\n\nDon't use the door\n\nThis is what\n\nThe hammer's for\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nEveryone is acting normal\n\nBut no one's sleeping through the night\n\nThere's a glow under the nightstand\n\nIt's a sickly kind of light\n\nMaybe takes you down a hole\n\nMaybe leads you out of reach\n\nUse the darkness as a cover\n\nMeet your friends down on the beach\n\n\n\nBreak the glass\n\nDon't use the door\n\nThis is what\n\nThe hammer's for\n\nYeah",
