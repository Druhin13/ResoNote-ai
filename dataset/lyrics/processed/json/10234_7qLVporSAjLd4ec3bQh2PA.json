  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Walking with a Killer par The Breeders\r\nI'm walking with a killer and I'm gonna need that ride\nWe rolled through the night\nThrough the cornfields of East 35\n\nI didn't know I should have\nI didn't know it was my night to die\nBut it really was\n\nI had no desire for hopes or holidays\nYet our eyes meet\nI slide to him, my thigh's sticking on the seat\n\nI'm a dark star\nI'm done\nI glow the headlights as they hit the street\n\nI am blinding\n\nI'm walking with a killer and I'm gonna need that ride\nWe walked through the night\nThrough the cornfields of East 35\n\nI would not survive\nI didn't know it was my time to die\n\nI'm going out\nI'm a dark star\nI'm done\n\nI glow in the headlights as I hit the street\nAll the way home he kissed me",
