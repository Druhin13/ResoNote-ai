  "lyrics": "When you get older, plainer, saner\r\nWill you remember all the danger we came from\r\nBurning like embers, falling, tender\r\nLonging for the days of no surrender\r\nYears ago\r\nAnd will you know\n\n\n\nSo smoke 'em if you got 'em\n\n'Cause it's going down\n\nAll I ever wanted was you\n\nI'll never get to heaven\n\n'Cause I don't know how\n\n\n\nLet's raise a glass or two\n\nTo all the things I've lost on you\n\nOh oh\n\nTell me are they lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nJust that you could cut me loose\n\nOh oh\n\nAfter everything I've lost on you\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nBaby is that lost on you?\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\n\n\nWishing I could see the machinations\n\nUnderstand the toil of expectations in your mind\n\nHold me like you never lost your patience\n\nTell me that you love me more than hate me all the time\n\nAnd you're still mine\n\n\n\nSo smoke 'em if you've got 'em\n\n'Cause it's going down\n\nAll I ever wanted was you\n\nLet's take a drink of heaven\n\nThis can turn around\n\n\n\nLet's raise a glass or two\n\nTo all the things I've lost on you\n\nOh oh\n\nTell me are they lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nJust that you could cut me loose\n\nOh oh\n\nAfter everything I've lost on you\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nBaby is that lost on you?\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\n\n\nLet's raise a glass or two\n\nTo all the things I've lost on you\n\nOh oh\n\nTell me are they lost on you?\n\nOh oh\n\nJust that you could cut me loose\n\nOh oh\n\nAfter everything I've lost on you\n\nIs that lost on you?\n\nIs that lost on you?",
