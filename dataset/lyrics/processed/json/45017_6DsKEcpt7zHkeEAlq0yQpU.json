  "lyrics": "My daddy says he's 'friends with Uncle Sam'\r\nI try to change his mind and those baby booming ways\r\nBoth my hands are full and I still forgot something\r\nI walk fast I talk fast, you better listen fast, or you get left behind\r\nMy mama loves me she squeezes me, she believes in medicine\n\nWants me to succeed and fix 'those things' inside my head\n\n\"Love is not loving\" mama, that's what Bowie said\n\n\n\nHe's got some secrets he can't wait to tell\n\nCathartic, robotic, don't worry about hurting bodies\n\nGuess you don't believe in hell?\n\nWell, 'hell'\n\n\n\nHe comes around, he kicks her down, she still licks his shadow off the ground\n\nUntil I make a sound\n\n\"Don't be cruel to a heart that's true\" like Elvis crowned\n\n\n\nMaybe I should see my therapist\n\nShe makes me feel sane\n\nI didn't mean to make your head spin\n\nI have a lot to say\n\nI have a lot to say\n\n\n\nMy puzzle's easy to solve\n\nI still got all my pieces - peace man\n\nYou're like a dart on the wall\n\nA far cry from the bull's-eye, you better hold tight or you will fall\n\n\n\nThink I'm aggressive?\n\nI'm just obsessive\n\nMaybe I'll sleep when I'm dead\n\n\"The best is yet to come\" like Frankie said\n\n\n\nMaybe I should see my therapist\n\nShe makes me feel sane\n\nI didn't mean to make your head spin\n\nI have a lot to say\n\nI have a lot to say\n\n\n\nI have a lot to say\n\nI have a lot to say\n\nThank you for listening to what we have to say\n\nI had a lot to say",
