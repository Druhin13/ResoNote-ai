  "lyrics": "I like the way that you look in my headlights\r\nClimbing off your balcony\r\nWe drive away, like you're earning that Lucky Strike\r\nHanging in-between your teeth\r\nIt's not a lot but it's sweet when it's simple\n\nDon't overthink it, just dive in and let go\n\nDon't complicate, I like you babe\n\n\n\nI like the way my car smells with your cigarettes in my ashtray\n\nI like the way that sun felt when it rolls over the freeway\n\nSo I turn to you and say \"Can you promise me now\n\nThat we're never gonna settle for settling down?\"\n\nI don't wanna think about the rest of my life\n\nI just want the things I like\n\n\n\nI found a burnt CD-R in your visor\n\nFrom back when you were in a band\n\nYou laughed so hard it hurt\n\nBut I like how that guitar looked when it was in your hands\n\n\n\nIt's kinda sweet how you ramble when you're drinking\n\nSo stay with me, I'm addicted to this feeling\n\nDon't complicate, I like you babe\n\n\n\nI like the way my car smells with your cigarettes in my ashtray\n\nI like the way that sun felt when it rolls over the freeway\n\nSo I turn to you and say \"Can you promise me now\n\nThat we're never gonna settle for settling down?\"\n\nI don't wanna think about the rest of my life\n\nI just want the things I like\n\n\n\nI like the way (I like the way)\n\nI like you babe (I like the way)\n\n\n\nI like the way my car smells with your cigarettes in my ashtray\n\nI like the way that sun felt when it rolls over the freeway\n\nSo I turn to you and say \"Can you promise me now\n\nThat we're never gonna settle for settling down?\"\n\nI don't wanna think about the rest of my life\n\nI just want the things I like\n\n\n\nI like the way (I like the way)\n\nI like the way (I like the way)\n\nI just want the things I like",
