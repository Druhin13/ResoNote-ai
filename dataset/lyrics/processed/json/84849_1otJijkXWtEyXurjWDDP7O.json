  "lyrics": "I am so drained\r\nI call out and I can’t hear your name\r\nMy pulse through the roof\r\nWas this all in vain?\r\nHot flashes, cold sweats\n\nWhere will I find you next?\n\nThoughts flood into my head\n\nI’ve woken up to an empty bed\n\n\n\nHot flashes, cold sweats\n\nWhere will I find you next?\n\nThoughts flood into my head\n\nPlease don’t tell me you left me here again\n\nJust don’t go back there again\n\n\n\nWalking on a knife’s edge\n\nTo keep the blades at bay\n\nHoping for a time where they’d just crack and rust away\n\n\n\nSilence makes the mind wander\n\nDistance makes the body weak\n\nTell me you’re alright\n\nPlease be safe\n\n\n\nAlways within reach but never close enough\n\nAlways within reach but I’m never fast enough\n\n\n\nI’ve watched a soul bleed out\n\nOver and over\n\nI’ve watched a soul bleed\n\nI felt my soul bleed out\n\nI can’t go on\n\n\n\nAnd as I rode with you in the back of the ambulance\n\nI stopped and I thought\n\nWill I ever see you again\n\nWill you ever open your fucking eyes\n\n\n\nEach step I take is a balancing act\n\nA reoccurring spate of heart attacks\n\nExpecting the worst to come\n\nHoping you find the strength to carry on\n\n\n\nKnifes edge\n\nI still remember every word you said\n\nThe weight is lifted along with all the dread\n\n\n\nI was so drained\n\nYou wear your scars but you’re still here breathing\n\nMy pulse is subdued\n\nThis was not in vain",
