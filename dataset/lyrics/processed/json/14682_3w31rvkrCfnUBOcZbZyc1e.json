  "lyrics": "I don't feel much different than I did ten years ago\r\nA few more lines around my lies, but they don't always show\r\nTime, it just reminds us of where we used to be\r\nAnd I can say the distance, boy, it seems so far to me\r\nCome so far, seems so far\n\nSeems like that's what makes us who we are\n\nMake me wise beyond my years\n\nThe end is out there somewhere, but it seems so far from here\n\n\n\nI've got my share of notches carved on these old bums of mine\n\nI walk just a little but crooked, but I'll straighten out sometime\n\nIf I got it right, well, there ain't no guarantee\n\nOne foot behind the other, son, it seems so far to me\n\n\n\nCome so far, seems so far\n\nSeems like that's what makes us who we are\n\nMake me wise beyond my years\n\nThe end is out there somewhere, but it seems so far from here\n\n\n\nI don't feel so young, but I don't feel any older\n\nAll I know for sure is, It ain't over 'til it's over\n\nNothin's gonna change me from the ways I'm set in\n\nI don't know what's waitin' 'round the bend\n\n\n\nCome so far, seems so far\n\nSeems like that's what makes us who we are\n\nMake me wise beyond my years\n\nThe end is out there somewhere, but it seems so far from here\n\nWe know it's out there somewhere, but it seems so far from here",
