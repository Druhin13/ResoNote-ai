  "lyrics": "Hold onto your hat, hold onto your heart \nReady, get set to tear this place apart \nDon't need a ticket, only place in town \nThat'll take you up to heaven and never bring you down \nAnything goes! Anything goes! \n\n\nWomen to the left, Women to the right \n\nThere to entertain and take you thru the night \n\nSo grab a little heat and come along with me \n\n'Cause your mama don't mind what your mama don't see \n\nAnything goes! Anything goes! \n\n\n\nRock! Rock! till you drop \n\nRock! Rock! never stop \n\nRock! Rock! till you drop \n\nI say Rock! Rock! to the top \n\n\n\nRidin' into danger, laughin' all the way \n\nFast, free and easy, livin' for today \n\nGotta lip service, get it while you can \n\nHot, sweat 'n' nervous love on demand \n\nAnything goes! Anything goes! \n\n\n\nRock! Rock! Give it to me \n\nIt's what I got goin' thru' me \n\nDon't ever stop do it to me \n\nYeah, Rock! Rock! You really move me \n\n\n\nHold on, hold on, hold tight \n\nWe're gonna rock tonight \n\nToo loud man, too loud",
