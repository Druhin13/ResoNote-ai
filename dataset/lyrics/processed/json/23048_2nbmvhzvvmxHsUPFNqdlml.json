  "lyrics": "Skylark\nHave you anything to say to me?\nWon't you tell me where my love can be?\nIs there a meadow in the mist\nWhere someone's waiting to be kissed?\n\n\nSkylark\n\nHave you seen a valley green with spring?\n\nWhere my heart can go a journeying\n\nOver the shadows and the rain\n\nTo a blossom covered lane\n\n\n\nAnd in your lonely flight\n\nHaven't you heard the music in the night?\n\nWonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp\n\nCrazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon\n\n\n\nOh skylark\n\nI don't know if you can find these things\n\nBut my heart is riding on your wings\n\nSo if you see them anywhere\n\nWon't you lead me there?\n\n\n\nOh skylark\n\nI don't know if you can find these things\n\nBut my heart is riding on your wings\n\nSo if you see them anywhere\n\nWon't you lead me there?",
