  "lyrics": "Sorrow sure endures inside of me (slowly) \nI give it a home in a human head (slowly)\r\nWe all carry our own burdens\r\nAnd I've been holding on to this one since before you left\r\nThis time, logic won't release you from me\n\nYou follow orders as I question my world (question my world)\n\nBoth growing older, still the great seas divide us from each other\n\nInspired by dignity, I listen to your song\n\nBereavement in melody, your words were never wrong\n\nWill you be the same you?\n\nWith so much more to say, all the words left on the shores of my mistakes\n\nBury them deep down\n\nAnd resurrect in me, the one the ones beside me need\n\nResurrect in me\n\nCelebrating the choices that we make, can feel so out of place\n\nWhen the cost is distance, the loss is so persistent\n\nWhen the cost is distance, the loss seems so persistent\n\nWill you be the same you?\n\nWith so much more to say, all the words left on the shores of my mistakes\n\n\n\nBury them deep down\n\nAnd resurrect in me, the one the ones beside me need\n\n\n\nWon’t you resurrect in me?\n\nNow I’ve kept a hold of distant memories about you showing your strength within the worst of times\n\nCourage came to you at a young age\n\nYet it seems he's easily forgotten\n\nAnd it's easy to feel rotten\n\nThis time logic won't release you from me",
