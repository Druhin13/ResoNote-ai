  "lyrics": "Fresh out the box, shiny and new\r\nPlayed it so much 'til it went out of tune\r\nI tightened the peg 'til the tension erupts\r\nDidn't think that I could give up\r\nThe record I spun when I was young\r\nSpoke to my heart and fit just like a glove\n\nBut now that it's played out, the needle is worn\n\nDidn't think that I could give up\n\n\n\nWhat changed, what changed?\n\nIt's more than just our age\n\nOr how the music tastes and I'm askin'\n\nWhat changed, what changed?\n\n\n\n'Cause now we're singing different songs\n\nForgetting how to sing along together\n\nWhen every note comes out so wrong\n\nIt keeps on getting harder to remember\n\nThe melodies or what the lyrics mean\n\n'Cause now we're singing different songs\n\nForgetting how to sing along together\n\n\n\nWe once called it love, devolved into lust\n\nJealousy speaks out to silence the trust\n\nWe temper our words 'cause we're scared of the truth\n\nHumming tunes that we can't get through\n\nWhen I hear your voice, I hear someone else\n\nThe stress on my heart's getting bad for my health\n\nSo should we admit that we've both had enough?\n\nDidn't think that we could give up\n\n\n\nSo what changed, what changed?\n\nIt's more than just our age\n\nOr how the music tastes and I'm askin'\n\nWhat changed, what changed?\n\n\n\n'Cause now we're singing different songs\n\nForgetting how to sing along together\n\nWhen every note comes out so wrong\n\nIt keeps on getting harder to remember\n\nThe melodies or what the lyrics mean\n\n'Cause now we're singing different songs\n\nForgetting how to sing along together\n\n\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nCan't sing along together\n\n\n\nFace to face, so far apart\n\nWe're worlds away from what we were before\n\nBefore, before we started singing...\n\n\n\nDifferent songs (Singing different songs)\n\nForgetting how to sing along together\n\nWhen every note comes out so wrong\n\nIt keeps on getting harder to remember\n\nThe melodies or what the lyrics mean\n\n'Cause now we're singing different songs\n\nForgetting how to sing along together, no, no\n\n\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh\n\nCan't sing along together",
