  "lyrics": "I’ve been waiting, give me a sign\r\nThere’s nothing left to face, only the time\r\nI see shadows, devils, decline\r\nI’ve lost my faith in us, found my design\r\nSo now…\n\nWhere is the enemy\n\nI can feel no bite\n\nWhere is the enemy\n\nWhen death is on my side\n\n\n\nSomething building, raging inside\n\nThis hope gave me release, gave me a why\n\nCan’t shake this ground beneath, I came to fight\n\n\n\nSo now…\n\nWhere is the enemy\n\nI can feel no bite\n\nWhere is the enemy\n\nWhen death is on my side\n\n\n\nConsuming victory\n\nThe trumpets calling out to me by name\n\nBy name\n\nNo looming debt for me\n\nNo, death will find his aim to be in vain\n\nIn vain\n\n\n\nSo now…\n\nWhere is the enemy\n\nI can feel no bite\n\nWhere is the enemy\n\nWhen death is on my side",
