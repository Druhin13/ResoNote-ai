  "lyrics": "I used to be tryna be perfect in every way\r\nI used to care about what people say\r\nI never questioned being on picket fences\r\nI'm not afraid about where I fit into the frame\r\nSatisfied to drive in my own lane\r\nSo quit denying, yesterday is dying\n\n\n\nI'll never be, I'll never be\n\nAll of the things that you need me to be\n\nYou'll never see, you'll never see\n\nThat version of me\n\n\n\nI'm not the girl in the white dress\n\nI'm not your fairytale princess\n\nI'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry\n\nSome day you'll know the reason why\n\nI'm not the girl in the white dress\n\nI'm impressing my darkness\n\nI'm really sorry that I let you down\n\nBut I'm still gonna make you proud\n\n\n\nClose your eyes\n\nWhy don't you try to keep an open mind?\n\nI hope you know how hard I really tried\n\nIt might be a hard truth but it's not about you\n\nThis is mine so don't treat me like I'm a crime\n\nMy life, my lesson learned in time\n\nDon't need against you, you don't have to be you\n\n\n\nYou'll never see, you'll never see\n\nThat version of me\n\n\n\nI'm not the girl in the white dress\n\nI'm not your fairytale princess\n\nI'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry\n\nSome day you'll know the reason why\n\nI'm not the girl in the white dress\n\nI'm impressing my darkness\n\nI'm really sorry that I let you down\n\nBut I'm still gonna make you proud\n\n\n\nI'll never be, I'll never be\n\nAll of the things that you need me to be\n\n\n\nI'm not the girl in the white dress\n\nI'm not your fairytale princess\n\nI'm sorry, mama, that I made you cry\n\nSome day you'll know the reason why\n\nI'm not the girl in the white dress\n\nI'm impressing my darkness\n\nI'm really sorry that I let you down\n\nBut I'm still gonna make you proud",
