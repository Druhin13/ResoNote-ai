Not quite\n\nI can't stand and be polite\n\nI don't beat around the bush, I'm not 'aight\n\nDone tryna be patient, I'm so irritated\n\nI just wanna know what we're doing\n\nTelling people that I'm taken\n\nWhen there's other things I wanna be pursuing\n\n\n\nHoes you keep chasing\n\nHeart keep on breaking\n\nGot me feeling like I'm single while taken\n\nHoes you keep chasing\n\nHeart keep on breaking\n\nGot me feeling like I'm single while taken\n\nHoes you keep chasing\n\nHeart keep on breaking\n\nGot me feeling like I'm single while taken\n\nGot me feeling like I'm single while taken\n\nGot me feeling like I'm single while taken",
