  "lyrics": "I was only seventeen, you the high school beauty queen\r\nUnbelievable\r\nYou were living on my street, oh so near but out of reach\r\nUnbelievable\r\nWhen I called to your door, never felt so scared before\r\nUnbelievable\n\nStood there in your dressing gown, without a thought you shot me down\n\nUnbelievable\n\n\n\nI grew up and made a life, worked a job from 9 to 5\n\nUnbelievable\n\nSaved my cash and bought a car, spent my night at Jackie’s bar\n\nUnbelievable\n\n\n\nThen one night you walked in with your grin and bright blue eyes\n\nYou said \"Sorry that I shot you down, that was then, I was young and this is now.\"\n\nUnbelievable \n\nUnbelievable \n\n\n\nNow we’re here side by side, I’m your man and you’re my wife\n\nUnbelievable\n\nWe have a child, twenty-two, bright blue eyes she looks like you\n\nUnbelievable\n\nI thank my lucky stars at night, I am yours and you are mine\n\nUnbelievable \n\nAnd when there comes a day I die, know that you’ve been my whole life\n\nYou’re unbelievable\n\nYou’re unbelievable\n\nYou’re unbelievable\n\nYou’re unbelievable\n\nYou’re unbelievable",
