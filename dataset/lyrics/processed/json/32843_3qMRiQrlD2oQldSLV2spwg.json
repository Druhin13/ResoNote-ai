  "lyrics": "Oh I've heard the sound of angels wings\r\nSlow and sweetly softly fluttering\r\nIt's been some time since I believed at all, at all\r\nOh I've heard the sound of devils tongues\r\nHow their whispers burned me more than once\n\nOh my disbelief is not enough at all, at all\n\n\n\nAnd if ever I could make this up\n\nAnd if ever I could make this up\n\nIf ever I could make this up at all, at all\n\nAt all, at all",
