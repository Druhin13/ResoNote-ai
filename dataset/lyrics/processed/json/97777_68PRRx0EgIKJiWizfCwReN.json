You sent me off a thousand times now it’s fuck you\r\nYou ain’t give no fuck ‘bout me\n\nYou was cracking them cards and sellin’ that shit\n\nI was out on the block with nun’ but a nick\n\nHunnit deep with the partnas plotting on a lick\n\nLife on the line, taking a risk\n\nProtecting the side, I’m bangin’ the stick\n\nYou gettin’ money ain’t fronted me shit\n\nWhen I asked you for it you spent that on a bitch\n\n\n\nI knew that you wasn’t gon' ride\n\nYou say that you got me but you steady lying\n\nIf you know you got it why you couldn’t provide\n\nIf you gettin’ money don’t leave out yo' guys\n\n\n\nI was up on the block with a Glock in my hands, makin’ sure niggas made it home safe\n\nYou was up on the block with some rocks in yo hands, I was slayin’ anything came yo way\n\nI was protection for you any day\n\nAll I ask for you is to put me in play\n\nMama was struggling, daddy ain’t there, you was playin’ with 50k up in my face\n\nI could’ve robbed you, I could’ve shot you but nigga my loyalty go a long way\n\nYou spendin’ that shit on a bitch and I couldn’t really trip, it’s yo shit at the end of the day\n\nYou spendin’ that shit on some kicks but how can I trip, it’s yo shit at the end of the day\n\nBut bitch I’m yo homie so how could you leave me, I had struggle and showing you fake, aye\n\n\n\nI knew that you wasn’t gon ride\n\nShould’ve separated, should’ve changed my crowd\n\nI really looked at you as one of the guys\n\nShould’ve cut you off the first time that you lied\n\n\n\nYou ain’t give no fuck ‘bout me\n\nYou was cracking them cards and sellin’ that shit\n\nI was out on the block with nun’ but a nick\n\nHunnit deep with the partnas plotting on a lick\n\nLife on the line, taking a risk\n\nProtecting the side, I’m bangin’ the stick\n\nYou gettin’ money ain’t fronted me shit\n\nWhen I asked you for it you spent that on a bitch\n\n\n\nI knew that you wasn’t gon' ride\n\nYou say that you got me but you steady lying\n\nIf you know you got it why you couldn’t provide\n\nIf you gettin’ money don’t leave out yo guys",
