  "lyrics": "Turn up that fader\r\nIt's like a lightning bolt\r\nWe can't be saved\r\nSo now I'm listening on my own\r\nOnce there was a time when\r\nYou had me hypnotized\n\nYou realized that\n\nYour fingerprints were on my bones\n\n\n\nI kept falling into every lie\n\nGetting pulled right back when I said goodbye, ooh\n\n\n\nOh, I get lost\n\nI get lost\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nBut at what cost\n\nOh, at what cost\n\nDo I let you\n\nDo what you do?\n\n\n\nThough all the scars are healing\n\nYouâ€™re always biting back\n\nYou know the struggle's real\n\nWhen I lie down then you attack, ooh\n\nWhy don't you stop seeing\n\nThrough the looking glass\n\nI watch myself sinking\n\nYou're the star and I'm the cast\n\n\n\nI kept falling into every lie\n\nGetting pulled right back when I said goodbye, ooh\n\n\n\nOh, I get lost\n\nI get lost\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nBut at what cost\n\nOh, at what cost\n\nDo I let you\n\nDo what you do?\n\n\n\nNo, we can't go back the way we came\n\nOn that same old track but broken train\n\nCan't keep loving you\n\nI can't keep loving you\n\nI can't love you again\n\n\n\nOh, I get lost\n\nI get lost\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nBut at what cost\n\nOh, at what cost\n\nDo I let you\n\nDo what you do?",
