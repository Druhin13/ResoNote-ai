  "lyrics": "Blue likes to drop sometimes, one by one\r\nBut I don't mind, no I don't mind\r\nCause luck is on my side\r\nI feel the drip drop, nonstop, pour on tonight\r\nSo what if the rain falls?\n\nLet's ?nd the gold at the end of the rainbow\n\nSo what if the rain falls?\n\nI'll shower in shimmers of gold\n\n\n\nBlue likes to drop sometimes, all at once\n\nBut I don't mind, no I don't mind\n\nCause luck is on my side\n\nI'm looking at where the man upstairs might live, fall on tonight\n\n\n\nSo what if the sky falls?\n\nWe'll build a life right on the cotton clouds\n\nSo what if the sky falls?\n\nWe'll play hide and seek with the stars\n\n\n\nLet the rain fall, let the sky fall\n\nLet it all fall\n\nLet the rain fall, let the sky fall\n\nLet it all fall\n\n\n\nSo what if the rain falls?\n\nLet's ?nd the gold at the end of the rainbow\n\nSo what if the sky falls?\n\nWe'll build a life right on the cotton clouds",
