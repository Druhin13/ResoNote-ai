Though it isn’t me\n\nBoys will be bugs right?\n\n(Boys will be bugs right?)\n\n\n\nI'm a dumb teen boy\n\nAll I wanna do is quit\n\nMy mum told me that she's worried\n\nAnd I couldn't give a shit\n\nI have friends who understand me\n\nTheir names are spider, beetle, bee\n\nThey don’t say much but\n\nThey have always listened to me\n\n\n\nThe other boys at school\n\nThink it's cool to hate your parents\n\nBut they’re lying all the time\n\nThe bugs advised that I should let 'em\n\nAnd if you wanna cry\n\nMake sure that they never see it\n\nOr even better yet\n\nBlock it out and never feel it\n\n\n\nI just turned fourteen\n\nAnd I think I know everything\n\n\n\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\n\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\n\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\n\nAin't that how it's s’posed to be? Though it isn’t me\n\nBoys will be bugs right?\n\n(Boys will be bugs right?)\n\n\n\nJust turned fourteen\n\nAnd I think this year I'm gonna be mean\n\n(Just turned fourteen and I think I know everything)\n\nJust turned fourteen\n\nAnd I think this year I'm gonna be mean\n\n(Just turned fourteen and I think the world revolves around me)\n\n\n\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\n\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\n\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\n\nAin't that how it's s’posed to be? Though it isn’t me\n\nBoys will be bugs right?\n\n\n\nDon't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\n\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\n\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\n\nAin't that how it's s’posed to be? Though it isn’t me\n\nBoys will be bugs right?\n\n\n\n(Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary\n\nI punch my walls, stay out at night, and I do karate\n\nDon't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry\n\nAin't that how it's s’posed to be?
