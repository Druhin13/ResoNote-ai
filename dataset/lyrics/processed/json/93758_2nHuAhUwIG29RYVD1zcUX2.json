  "lyrics": "Another \"almost perfect\"\r\nDidn't work, but totally worth it\r\nBetter to have loved and lost my mind\r\nThan lose the nerve to even try\r\nAnother conversation\r\nAwkward, but the ice is breaking\n\nI've been in some shit relationships\n\nBut I've remained an optimist\n\n\n\nIt's not a game I'm playing\n\nIt's not a thrill I'm chasing\n\nMore like a space I'm saving\n\nAnd I don't even know your name\n\n\n\nBut if it gets me to you, then it ain't wasted time\n\nWith every \"so close,\" I'm closer to the rest of my life\n\nAnother bad first date (Check)\n\nAnother \"nothing left to say\" (Check)\n\nWhat I mean is, the way I see it\n\nI'm one heartbreak closer to you, you\n\n\n\nHey baby, can I call you \"baby?\" Is that okay?\n\nI don't even know you, but I can't wait to know you someday\n\nImagine someday when we look back\n\nI'll thank my past for giving me my future better half\n\n\n\nI'm sorry for the the time it's taking\n\nBut I'ma make it worth the waiting\n\nAnd all this wrong love that I learned from\n\nWas just practice for the right one\n\n\n\nIf it gets me to you, then it ain't wasted time\n\nWith every \"so close,\" I'm closer to the rest of my life\n\nAnother \"just got played\" (Check)\n\nA shot of bourbon for the pain (Check)\n\nWhat I mean is, the way I see it\n\nI'm one heartbreak closer to you, you\n\n\n\nIt's kinda strange to miss\n\nSomeone I haven't met yet\n\nSomeone I haven't kissed yet\n\nBut I'll go through it all\n\n\n\nIf it gets me to you, then it ain't wasted time\n\nWith every \"so close,\" I'm closer to the rest of my life\n\nAnother sad goodbye (Check)\n\nAnother sleepless night (Check)\n\nWhat I mean is, the way I see it\n\nI'm one heartbreak closer to you, you, you, you\n\nOne heartbreak closer to you",
