  "lyrics": "I'm getting older\r\nFounding myself and God getting a little bit closer\r\nIt's over\r\nI'm a little less reckless, little less wild card\r\nBreaking hearts kinda senseless\r\nYeah, I'm coming around\n\n\n\nI might cuss and fight, tell a few lies\n\nBreak a few rules, making promises I can't keep\n\nBut I've turned the page on wilder days\n\nI'm running all this down hoping you'll see\n\nI ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me\n\n\n\nI say I'm sorry\n\nSometimes it's the hardest part to tell somebody\n\nBut baby I'm sorry\n\nYeah I've been praying\n\nComing from me that might sound a little bit crazy\n\nBut that's how I'm changing\n\n\n\nI might cuss and fight, tell a few lies\n\nBreak a few rules, making promises I can't keep\n\nBut I've turned the page on wilder days\n\nI'm running all this down hoping you'll see\n\nI ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me yeah\n\n\n\nDidn't wanna call you up\n\nDidn't wanna just stop\n\nWanted to take my time and make sure I got every word right\n\n\n\nYeah, I still cuss and fight\n\nTell you lies\n\nBreak a few rules, making promises I can't keep\n\nBut I've turned the page on wilder days\n\nI'm running all this down hoping you'll see\n\nI ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me\n\nI ain't saying I'm perfect, but I'm working on a better me\n\n\n\nOn a better me\n\nBetter me",
