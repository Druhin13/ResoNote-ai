  "lyrics": "They say there was progress\r\nThe holy among us\r\nI thought they would lead us through the night\r\nBut fear has consumed us\r\nA feeling we can't trust\r\nI hope this will open up their eyes\n\n\n\nStand up before it gets too late\n\nLove now when all is down to hate\n\n\n\nSo I stare at the sun\n\nAnd I can't take back, I can't take back the world\n\nAnd I stare at the sun\n\nAnd it burns my heart\n\nAs I cry I am left with the lie of all of these forgotten ones\n\nAnd we can't take back just what we did\n\nAnd we can't take back the things we said\n\nBut I'll try to change this world again\n\nBefore we lose our hope\n\n\n\nFeel like a dead man walking\n\nA dead man walking\n\nI'm a dead man walking\n\nA dead man walking\n\n\n\nI thought you could hold me\n\nI thought this would show me\n\nThat we will live eternal nights\n\nBut I can't be bought, no\n\nI won't be taught, no\n\nI have no faith to run back to\n\n\n\nPlease try before it gets too late\n\nWe can choose to end this fate\n\n\n\nSo I stare at the sun\n\nAnd I can't take back, I can't take back the world\n\nAnd I stare at the sun\n\nAnd it burns my heart\n\nAs I cry I am left with the lie of all of these forgotten ones\n\nAnd we can't take back just what we did\n\nAnd we can't take back the things we said\n\nBut I'll try to change this world again\n\nBefore we lose our hope\n\n\n\nFeel like a dead man walking\n\nA dead man walking\n\nI'm a dead man walking\n\nA dead man walking\n\n\n\nDon't smile at me with your sideways two-faced enemy to criticize he said she said\n\nAll these years are left for dead\n\nHow can we live our lives?\n\nHow can we live our lives now?\n\nThis is oppression\n\nAnd where's your goddamn king?\n\nWhat's missing?\n\n\n\nAnd if you're fed up then rise up from the dirt",
