  "lyrics": "A drop in the ocean,\r\nMoved in slow motion\r\nAnd it hit me out of the blue\r\nI follow blindly, however unlikely\r\nThat i'd find you, I'd find you, I just knew\r\nHere I am\n\nI lost you once\n\nI won't lose you again\n\nThe dead ends a living hell\n\nThe story you can't tell\n\nBut your words still get through\n\nHere I am\n\nI lost you once\n\nI won't lose you again\n\nAnd I am here\n\nI love you\n\nI love you\n\nI miss you still\n\nHere I am\n\nHere I am\n\nHere I am\n\nI lost you once, I won't lose you again\n\nI lost you once, I won't lose you again\n\nI lost you once, I won't lose you again",
