  "lyrics": "(We’re rolling)\r\n(Alrighty)\r\nCounting constellations on the popcorn ceiling\r\nAnd staring at your picture on the wall\r\nRays of lonely moonlight slowly slice through the blinds\n\nAs the tears begin to fall\n\n\n\nI’m tired of sleeping alone\n\nI just want to be where you are\n\nTired of saying goodnight through the phone\n\nAnd waking up each morning in the dark\n\nBetter say a prayer\n\nTurn out the light\n\nAs I hug my pillow tight\n\nI’ll be with you soon my dear\n\nIf only in my dreams\n\n\n\nWho I am trying to fool, baby?\n\nI’m the one to blame\n\nFor the forces keeping us apart\n\nI’m stubborn and I’m bold\n\nAnd works got me in a stranglehold\n\nKeeping a vice around my heart\n\nIndifference over distance\n\nDon’t fare well\n\nMaybe a goodnight kiss from you\n\nWould break me from my spell\n\n\n\nCause I’m tired of sleeping alone\n\nI just want to be where you are\n\nTired of saying goodnight through the phone\n\nAnd waking up each morning in the dark\n\nBetter say a prayer\n\nTurn out the light\n\nAs I hug my pillow tight\n\nI’ll be with you soon my dear\n\nIf only in my dreams\n\n\n\nAh, here we go again\n\nOff to Neverneverland\n\n\n\nBetter say a prayer\n\nTurn out the light\n\nAs I hug my pillow tight\n\nI’ll be with you soon my dear\n\nIf only in my dreams\n\n\n\nBetter say a prayer\n\nTurn out the light\n\nAs I hug my pillow tight\n\nI’ll be with you soon tonight\n\nIf only in my dreams",
