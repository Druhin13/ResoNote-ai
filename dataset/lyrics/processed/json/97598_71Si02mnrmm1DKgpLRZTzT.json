  "lyrics": "Hot plate from the Texaco\r\nCold drink and a can of Skoal\r\nAin't really know where to go\r\nSo we head out to nowhere\r\nTurn left at the laundromat\r\nCall the boys, say, \"Where y'all at?\"\n\nWe're halfway through a six pack\n\nAnd we'll meet y'all out there\n\n\n\nBaby got her feet up like it ain't no thing\n\nI hit the pedal, make the paddle stroke sing\n\n\n\nWe're just little town livin'\n\nWhen the sun goes down, we're gonna ride\n\nTurnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket\n\nWe're just little town livin' it up tonight\n\n\n\nKey on the tree, you know the place\n\nLast one in, don't forget the gate\n\nField full of Fords and Chevrolets, yeah\n\nMy kind of party\n\nA little diesel on a pile of wood\n\nStir it up, get it burnin' good\n\nShe wants to dance like I knew she would\n\nSo let's get it started\n\n\n\nTwist it off, turn it up, pass it around\n\nNo other place I'd rather be right now and\n\n\n\nWe're just little town livin'\n\nWhen the sun goes down, we're gonna ride\n\nTurnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket\n\nWe're just little town livin' it up tonight\n\nWrap your baby in your jacket, hold her real close\n\nWatch the stars fall out of the sky\n\nAin't got a lot, but ain't a damn thing missing\n\nWe're just little town livin' it up tonight\n\n\n\nJust some blue jean girls and Cali boys killin' some time\n\nWalkin' the line and worry about nothin' tonight\n\n\n\nWe're just little town livin'\n\nWhen the sun goes down, we're gonna ride\n\nTurnin' dirt into dust, yeah, that's the ticket\n\nWe're just little town livin' it up\n\nWe're just little town livin' it up tonight\n\n(We're just little town livin' it up)\n\nWe're just leanin' it back, we're just cruisin' around\n\nWe don't smoke it a lot, but if she wants it, I'm down\n\nIf she wants to dance, I got my boots on\n\nShe got her boots on and it's on, yeah\n\nWe're just little town livin' it up tonight",
