  "lyrics": "Wouldn't it be nice\r\nTo not have to care about anything or anyone?\r\nIt's not that I don't like you anymore\r\nI think that I'm just having trouble\r\nFeeling successful in my own life\r\nMaybe we could take some time to think\n\n\n\nSo I'll cut off all my fingers at the bone\n\n'Cause its easier than trying to be okay\n\nWith the parts of me that I don't like\n\n\n\nIt's not as glamorous as you thought it'd be\n\nIt's not as easy as everyone made it seem\n\nWhy did it ever feel like a good idea to be alone?\n\n\n\nSo what's it gonna take\n\nFor these feelings to disappear?\n\nWhat else can I do\n\nTo make my anxieties go away?\n\nHow else can I try\n\nTo get by without ending it all?\n\n\n\nWhen there's nowhere you can run\n\nI promise I'll still be the one\n\nYou can call when you can't sleep\n\n\n\nAnd someday we'll look back and say\n\n\"why were we ever so afraid\n\nTo say how we feel?\"",
