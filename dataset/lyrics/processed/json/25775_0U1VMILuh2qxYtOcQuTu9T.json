  "lyrics": "I became awake,\r\nFrom a very dark place, a patchwork of fear, of poorly conceived ideas.\r\nWith a blister of water, the mark of working hands,\r\nReady to catch, or cut.\r\nThe senses aligned, the animal urgency, and voices picked up,\r\nFlowing over the static, late, quiet.\n\n\n\nI became awake.\n\nFingers are open, eyes they are open, the firing if images, an orchestra of scribbles.\n\nThe guts of an engine, the veins of a leaf, light onto paper, exposed.\n\nA filament in a bulb, up above or in the ground.\n\nTogether we are magic, together we are dreaming, together we reach enlessly,\n\nThe centre of a seed, so full of possibilities.\n\n\n\nI became awake.\n\nI thought I was sleeping, but I was only forming a structure with no ceiling, \n\nWith words like a runway, a cloud of a person drifting away.\n\nI was heavy, but now I am light.\n\nI was heavy, but now I am light\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Diana for these lyrics)",
