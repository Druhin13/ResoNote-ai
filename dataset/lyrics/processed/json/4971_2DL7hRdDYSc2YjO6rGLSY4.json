  "lyrics": "I walk down the road looking for my tribunal\r\nLike tom and huck stumbling down the aisle of their own funeral\r\nPlease goddess of the road, get me on my way\r\nYou see my love just left me so I'm on my own\r\nAnd my heart's banged up looking for a foster home\n\nAnd the highway moon is getting me dizzy\n\n\n\nI see a mirage of medusa, a top of an Appaloosa\n\nWhat I wouldn't do to be with you and your caboosa\n\nWhispering to Mr. Beck now who's the real loser\n\n\n\nHere come again the midnight Lorry\n\nI think I might be moving along\n\nThere's a lot of places I got to get to\n\nI know you're out there but I never even met you\n\nTake me to the land of no worry\n\nAnd then I'll just keep playing this song\n\nMr. Driver I hear the music playin' and I see the lights\n\nWill you throw me a ride\n\n\n\nA PYT ushers me back to the rear\n\nI haven't been many places and I definitely haven't been here\n\nTo think I was just a lonely soul in the cold with my thumb out\n\nAnd now I'm rolling a smoke and being told to stick my tongue out\n\n\n\nWe bounced and blared and so did the Lorry\n\nShe teased my hair and held me close with a story\n\nOf rag tag visions as the moonlight poured in\n\nSecond star to the right and straight on til' morning\n\n\n\nHere come again the midnight Lorry\n\nI think I might be moving along\n\nThere's a lot of places I got to get to\n\nI know you're out there but I never even met you\n\nTake me to the land of no worry\n\nAnd then I'll just keep playing this song\n\nMr. Driver I hear the music playin' and I see the lights\n\nWill you throw me a ride\n\n\n\nLooking at her face was like looking at the sun\n\nShe said you can't ask of everybody what you don't ask of one\n\nEither way, we got today and that's all we may be allowed\n\nI know if we hold it together, there's real love we can bring about\n\n\n\nHere come again the midnight Lorry\n\nI think I might be moving along\n\nThere's a lot of places I got to get to\n\nI know you're out there but I never even met you\n\nTake me to the land of no worry\n\nAnd then I'll just keep playing this song\n\nMr. Driver I hear the music playin and I see the lights\n\nWill you throw me a ride\n\n\n\nHere come again the midnight Lorry\n\nI think I might be moving along\n\nThere's a lot of places I got to get to\n\nI know you're out there but I never even met you\n\nTake me to the land of no worry\n\nAnd then I'll just keep playing this song\n\nMr. Driver I hear the music playin' and I see the lights\n\nWill you throw me a ride\n\n\n\nHere come\n\nHere come\n\nHere come\n\n\n\nHere come\n\nHere come\n\nHere come",
