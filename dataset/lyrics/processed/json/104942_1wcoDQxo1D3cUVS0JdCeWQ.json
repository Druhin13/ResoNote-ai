  "lyrics": "Running late on a Wednesday\r\nShortcut by the freeway\r\nLocked eyes as you passed me\r\nTwo hearts on a cold street\r\nLooking back at the same time\r\nI feel your warmth, did you feel mine?\n\nI get the urge, but I can't speak\n\nTwo hearts on a cold street\n\nI know this sounds crazy\n\nBut this could be fate\n\nAnd I'm thinking maybe\n\nThat you feel it too\n\nTell me are you busy?\n\nAnd tell me you can stay\n\n'Cause I'm thinking maybe\n\nFor you, I would travel to outer space\n\nTake a bullet to the heart just to keep you safe\n\nFor you, anything for you\n\nWith you, all the years just fade away\n\nLike a dream in my arms, but I'm wide awake\n\nWith you, whenever I'm with you\n\nAin't it funny how the time flies?\n\nNow you're here as my wife\n\nRemember how you met me?\n\nTwo hearts on a cold street?\n\nThree kids, and a big house\n\nCan't believe we're here now\n\nYour warmth has never left me\n\nTwo hearts on a cold street\n\nAnd now it's not crazy\n\nI told you it's fate\n\nRemember that day as\n\nI lay here with you\n\nSo happy you weren't busy\n\nI'm glad that you stayed\n\nI still feel the same, yeah\n\nFor you, I would travel to outer space\n\nTake a bullet to the heart just to keep you safe\n\nFor you, anything for you\n\nWith you, all the years just fade away\n\nLike a dream in my arms, but I'm wide awake\n\nWith you, whenever I'm with you\n\nTwo hearts on a cold street\n\nTwo hearts on a cold street\n\nTwo hearts on a cold street\n\nTwo hearts, just you and me\n\nNow it's just you and me\n\nFor you, I would travel to outer space\n\nWith you, all the years just fade away\n\nFor you, I would travel to outer space\n\nTake a bullet to the heart just to keep you safe\n\nFor you, anything for you\n\nWith you, all the years just fade away\n\nLike a dream in my arms, but I'm wide awake\n\nWith you, whenever I'm with you\n\nWith you, with you, with you\n\nWith you, with you, with you\n\nWith you, with you, with you\n\nWith you, with you, with you",
