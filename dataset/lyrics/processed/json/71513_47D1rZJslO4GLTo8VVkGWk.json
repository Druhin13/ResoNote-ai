  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson My City par Sam Setton\r\nAre we talking street signs?\nOr the signs you say you saw\nTo make you move away\n\nMeet me on the west side\nTo see a side of me\nI've had to hide away\n\nAll that I know (All that I know)\nIs I belong here (I belong here)\nI've seen it before, so don't let me go\nCause I belong here\n\nIf I left my city, I\nIf I left my city\nI would never be the same no\n\n\nDo we have enough time?\nTo weave between the streets\nAnd make it to your place\n\nPromise me you won't lie\nIt's been way too long\nSince my last mistake\n\nI'm thinkin' bout that subway ride\nWhen you told me you weren't mine\nBut tried so hard to make me stay\nYou say that I'm colorblind\nThat all I see is black and white\nBut we both know that I won't change\nBecause\n\nAll that I know (All that I know)\n\nIs I belong here (I belong here)\n\nIf I left my city I\nIf I left my city\nI would never be the same\n\nAll I know, All I know\n(If I left my City, I)\n\nThere's no need to run or rush\nWe've been so lost\nSo out of touch\n\nIf I left my city, I\nIf I left my city\nI would never be the same",
