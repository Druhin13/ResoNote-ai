  "lyrics": "Steady\r\nSomething 'bout a rapper, something 'bout a singer\r\nTryna make a feeling last longer than a linger\r\nThey knew exactly what they were getting into\r\nHe was always sipping, she was something different\n\nTogether they were living, never, ever overthinking\n\nFalling in madly, running from their issues\n\nAnd he's not to blame, and she's not to blame\n\nDrinking the love that they pour in the cup 'cause it eases the pain\n\nAnd he'll never change, she'll never change\n\nBreathing the hope that they find in the smoke 'cause it eases the pain\n\n\n\nWe only love when our eyes get heavy\n\nWe only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady\n\nYeah, we only touch when our heads get messy\n\nWe only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady\n\n\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nHi-high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nHi-high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\n\n\nTory\n\nAlI you pulled up on you last night\n\nI didn't know what to do last night\n\nPulling on you, you put me on my knees, baby\n\nI was on the D, R, U and Gs, baby\n\nKeep it G, baby\n\nI've been way up, on the way up\n\nYou know what it it is, whenever I came through the cake up\n\nAnd you say you get this feeling with me, baby, on the real\n\nI get the same feeling with you, I know how you feel\n\nI said, keep it G with me\n\n'Cause this is what I'm do with you\n\nI'ma keep it 78 + 22 with you\n\nYou know what it is when I pull up in that new, new thang\n\nLooking for a new thang, ah\n\n\n\nWe only love when our eyes get heavy\n\nWe only laugh, we only dance when the high gets steady\n\nYeah, we only touch when our heads get messy\n\nWe only laugh, only attach when the high gets steady\n\n\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nHi-high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nHi-high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\n\n\nWe only love when our eyes get heavy\n\nWe only laugh\n\nWe only dance when the high gets steady\n\nYeah, we only touch when our heads get messy\n\nWe only laugh\n\nOnly attach when the high gets steady\n\nWhen the high gets steady\n\nHi-high gets steady\n\nWish we could love\n\nSober the buzz but I'm just not steady",
