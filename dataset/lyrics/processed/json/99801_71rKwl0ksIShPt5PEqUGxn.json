  "lyrics": "My best is pointless, outrun but I'll never win\r\nThis state of conflict makes sense, don't think about it\r\nI ran away when I was 15; I was dead by 17\r\nI know the world owes me everything\r\nI'm gonna take it, I'm gonna make it\n\nWalking on the warmer stones\n\nGoing nowhere, now I'm here\n\nNot a name for what I am\n\nI guess I'm just another demon of mercy\n\n\n\nAll talk, no action completely incomplete\n\nWhy wish me well when I know exactly what you think?\n\nI came alive when I was 18; You forget- I'm everything\n\nI know the world owes me nothing\n\nSo I'll take it, if I can make it\n\n\n\nWalking on the warmer stones\n\nGoing nowhere, now I'm here\n\nNot a name for what I am\n\nYour god's a weapon, he blessed every bullet\n\nWalking on the warmer stones\n\nGoing nowhere, now I'm here\n\nNot a name for what I am\n\nI guess I'm just another demon of mercy\n\n\n\nTell me anything, tell me anything\n\nOverrated and under-appreciated\n\nAnything, tell me anything\n\nBefore you know it, you'll be...\n\n\n\nWalking on the warmer stones\n\nGoing nowhere, now I'm here\n\nNot a name for what I am\n\nYour god's a weapon, he blessed every bullet\n\nWalking on the warmer stones\n\nGoing nowhere, now I'm here\n\nNot a name for what I am\n\nI guess I'm just another demon of mercy",
