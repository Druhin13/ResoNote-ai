  "lyrics": "Like Prince sang in Tennessee\r\nI wanna drive with you down there\r\nTo alphabet street\r\nAnd we can whisper with the stars\r\nLike when the world began\r\nAnd we can leak some beliefs skyward\n\n\n\nSinking in\n\nDriving\n\nMoving in\n\nCool climates\n\n\n\nGive me the oversight inside the other\n\nGive me the oversight inside the fantasy\n\n\n\nAnd with these inclinations\n\nThey will design a little box for you to play in\n\nOh, aimless sharks don’t react to soft attentions\n\nThey know how to wait\n\n\n\nSwooping in\n\nSilent\n\nMoving in\n\nCool\n\nFiring\n\n\n\nGive me the oversight inside the other\n\nGive me the oversight inside the other’s dream\n\n\n\nIs it safe, are we far for the mountains?\n\nWe walk through the trees\n\nIs it safe, sing a song for the zeros\n\nNothing is memory\n\nBlind like the censors seeking my surround\n\n\n\nGive me the oversight inside the other\n\nPrimitive over mind designs of ecstasy\n\nYou’re reaching into my heart\n\nAnd grinding fists in my soul\n\nGive me the oversight inside the other’s dream\n\n\n\nNow you’ve seen me at work\n\nNow you’ve seen me at work\n\nAre you excited, dear?",
