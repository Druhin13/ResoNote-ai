  "lyrics": "Well I brought the blanks, you made the target\r\nNo one will hear the shot from the closet\r\nBaby's got an alibi, baby's got an alibi\r\n\r\nYour voice sounds so sweet muffled and shaken\n\nBrando can wait, James Dean is starving\n\nTwenty seven messages and still no reply\n\n\n\nYou said it yourself, \"Love is a killer\"\n\nI never expected you'd be at the trigger\n\n\n\nWith a bullet for your sweetheart\n\nRoses for the casket\n\nShe's taken em' down one by one\n\nAll of her lovers die young\n\n\n\nBullet for your sweetheart\n\nRoses for the casket\n\nWhat an explosion we'll make\n\nKiss kiss, bang bang\n\n\n\nMy darling, everyone's heard the stories, the stories\n\nYou're out every night tasting the wine, because loneliness is boring\n\nWell I brought the candles, you stained em' red\n\nI fought the cancer, you kept the bed\n\nTwenty seven messages are loaded in hand\n\n\n\nYou got a bullet for your sweetheart\n\nRoses for the casket\n\nShe's taken em' down one by one\n\nAll of her lovers die young\n\n\n\nBullet for your sweetheart\n\nRoses for the casket\n\nWhat an explosion we'll make\n\nKiss kiss, bang bang\n\n\n\nShe's taken em' down one by one\n\nAll of her lovers die young\n\nShe's taken em' down one by one\n\nAnd all of her lovers die young\n\n\n\nHow could you do this to your sweetheart\n\nRoses for the casket\n\nShe's taken em' down one by one\n\nAll of her lovers die young\n\n\n\nBullet for your sweetheart\n\nRoses for the casket\n\nWhat an explosion we'll make\n\nWhat an explosion we'll make\n\nKiss kiss, bang bang",
