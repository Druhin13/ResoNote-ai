  "lyrics": "Do you want to be my friend\r\nShave my legs and cut my hair\r\nLong grass waving in the wind\r\nI get so strung out when\r\nEverything just falls together\n\nRocks and feathers, rainy weather\n\n\n\nCome and dig me up 'cause I'm not dead\n\nTuck the blankets on my bed\n\nStoke that fire in my head\n\nCan't help but think that maybe\n\nOh my baby you can save me from the city\n\nCome and take me to the country\n\n\n\nI never knew who I was before I found you\n\nI never knew who I was before I found you\n\nDon't let me sleep tonight\n\nDon't let me sleep tonight\n\nOh baby\n\n\n\nWrap you up in motel sheets\n\nI'm too restless I can't eat\n\nLonesome crowded west in me\n\nFeels so good to shake you\n\n\n\nOh my baby you amaze me, cool and shady\n\nI could die here in the country\n\n\n\nI never knew who I was before I found you\n\nI never knew who I was before I found you\n\nDon't let me sleep tonight\n\nDon't let me sleep tonight\n\nOh baby\n\n\n\nNo sky scrapers, no news from east coast papers\n\nCrop circles, blue nights when clouds are purple\n\nEverything just falls together\n\nRocks and feathers, rainy weather\n\n\n\nI never knew who I was before I found you\n\nI never knew who I was before I found you\n\nDon't let me sleep tonight\n\nDon't let me sleep tonight\n\nOh baby",
