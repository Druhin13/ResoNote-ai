  "lyrics": "I stole some hearts but dodged the bars out on the run\r\nCommitted crimes but not the time I should've done\r\nI'd feel the cops, that was enough to start laying low\r\nUntil the day I felt these chains not letting go\r\nCall me a convict, I've been convicted\n\nServing the verdict, a live sentence\n\n\n\nYou've got me locked up\n\nGo on and throw away the key\n\nI ain't ever gonna leave this prison\n\nYou got me locked down\n\nFor twenty-four hours a day\n\nI ain't ever gonna break this prison\n\nCouldn't run, couldn't hide even if I tried\n\nGirl I know you would find me and I'd wind up back in it\n\nYour love is like a prison\n\nYour love is like a prison\n\n\n\nGirl you're my judge, my jury, my executioner\n\nNo other way I'd have it babe, I'm your prisoner\n\nYeah I'm your prisoner\n\n\n\nYou've got me locked up\n\nGo on and throw away the key\n\nI ain't ever gonna leave this prison\n\nYou got me locked down\n\nFor twenty-four hours a day\n\nI ain't ever gonna break this prison\n\nCouldn't run, couldn't hide even if I tried\n\nGirl I know you would find me and I'd wind up back in it\n\nYour love is like a prison\n\nYour love is like a prison\n\n\n\nCall me a convict, I've been convicted\n\nServing the verdict, a live sentence\n\n\n\nYou've got me locked up\n\nGo on and throw away the key\n\nI ain't ever gonna leave this prison\n\nYou got me locked down\n\nFor twenty-four hours a day\n\nI ain't ever gonna break this prison\n\nCouldn't run, couldn't hide even if I tried\n\nGirl I know you would find me and I'd wind up back in it\n\nYour love is like a prison\n\nYour love is like a prison",
