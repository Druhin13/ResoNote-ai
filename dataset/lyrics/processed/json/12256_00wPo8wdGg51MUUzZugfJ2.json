  "lyrics": "This convalescent feeling\r\nIâ€™m back to this disease\r\nAnd all along the walls\r\nFeel safe until it breaks and rolls away\r\nCut me under\n\nUnderneath the sheets\n\nAnesthesia's seeping into me\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up\n\nIt's catching up\n\n\n\nThe simplicity, nervous energy\n\nHow am I supposed to live\n\nStand tall and walk around\n\nWith weak legs trying not to bow too far\n\n\n\nCut me under\n\nUnderneath the sheets\n\nAnesthesia's seeping into me\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up\n\nIt's catching up\n\nAnesthesia's seeping into me\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up\n\n\n\nCut me under\n\nUnderneath the sheets\n\nAnesthesia's seeping into me\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up\n\nIt's catching up\n\nAnesthesia's seeping into me\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up\n\nIt's catching up, it's catching up",
