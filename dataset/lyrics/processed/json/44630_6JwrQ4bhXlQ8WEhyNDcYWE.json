  "lyrics": "Can't find the light in the middle of the night\r\nCan't feel my feet when the river runs deep\r\nI close my eyes a thousand times and all I see is you\r\nI'm flying high\r\nIt's do or die\n\nI wanna feel the fall\n\nI wanna lose control\n\nIt's black and white\n\nSo wrong it's right\n\nI do it to myself\n\n\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\n\n\nIf I had to get\n\nIf I had to get\n\n\n\nI feel the pleasure hidden in the pain\n\nI feel the sunlight, fall through the rain\n\nBut I searched for you, but I searched for you\n\nAt time and time again\n\n\n\nI'm flying high\n\nIt's do or die\n\nI wanna feel the fall\n\nI wanna lose control\n\nIt's black and white\n\nSo wrong it's right\n\nI do it to myself\n\n\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\n\n\nIf I had to get\n\n\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\nIf I had to get lost to find you\n\nI would lose myself again\n\n\n\nIf I had to get",
