  "lyrics": "No, I think I'll stay in tonight\r\nSkip the conversations and the \"oh, I'm fine\"s\r\nNo, I'm no stranger to surprise\r\nThis paper town has let me down too many times\r\nWhy do I even try? Give me a reason why\r\nI thought that I could trust you, never mind\n\nWhy all the switching sides? Where do I draw the line?\n\nI guess I'm too naive to read the signs\n\n\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nAll they ever do is let me down\n\nEvery time I let somebody in\n\nThen I find out what they're all about\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nWonder where they're all hidin' out\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nGotta get up out of this town\n\n\n\nOh, ohhh... ohhh, ah\n\n\n\nI stay up, talkin' to the moon\n\nBeen feelin' so alone in every crowded room\n\nCan't help but feel like something's wrong, yeah\n\n'Cause the place I'm livin' in just doesn't feel like home\n\n\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nAll they ever do is let me down\n\nEvery time I let somebody in\n\nThen I find out what they're all about\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nWonder where they're all hidin' out\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nGotta get up out of this town\n\n\n\nLookin' for some new friends\n\nOh, ohhh... ohhh, ah\n\n\n\nI just wanna talk about nothin'\n\nWith somebody that means something\n\nSpell the names of all our dreams and demons\n\nFor the times that I don't understand\n\nTell me what's the point of a moon like this\n\nWhen I'm alone again\n\nCan I run away to somewhere beautiful\n\nWhere nobody knows my name?\n\n\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nAll they ever do is let me down\n\nEvery time I let somebody in\n\nBut I find out what they're all about\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nAll they ever do is let me down\n\nI'm just lookin' for some real friends\n\nGotta get up out of this town\n\n\n\nOh, ohhh... ohhh, ah",
