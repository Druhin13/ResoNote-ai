(You're not a girl, right?)\r\nAnd you won't ever be one based on my insight\r\nActually I don't know how this works\r\nThis confusing spectrum of modern sexuality\n\nI espouse it to my friends, but it churns me\n\n\n\nMom loves me too much\n\nAnd my daddy not enough\n\nAnd I grew up nouveau riche\n\nAnd I'm a slick son of a bitch\n\nOh\n\n\n\nAnd I can't (I can't), sustain (Sustain)\n\nBut I'll try (I'll try), if it numbs the pain\n\nAnd I can't (I can't), sustain (Sustain)\n\nBut I'll try (I'll try), if it numbs the pain\n\n\n\nBecause mom loves me too much\n\nAnd my daddy not enough\n\nAnd I grew up nouveau riche\n\nAnd I'm a slick son of a bitch\n\n\n\nBecause Bowie's my excuse\n\nSo I can brag of how I tried\n\nBut all I want to do\n\nIs send you off and get you high\n\nGet you high",
