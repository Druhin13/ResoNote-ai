  "lyrics": "Once upon a thrill from a kiss to a swill\r\nWe were swallowing the nights like we have nine lives\r\nDead and gone so long, seventeen so gone\r\nDead and gone so long, seventeen so...\n\nWe were bored like kids with a book of disorders\n\nMedicating every day to keep the straightness in order\n\n\n\nDead and gone so long, seventeen so gone\n\nDead and gone so long, seventeen so gone\n\n\n\nIt's the false side of hope, where believers concede\n\nAnd there's only memories when it's over\n\n\n\nSo pour out some liquor, make it an old fashioned\n\nRemember your youth and all that you do, the plank and the passion\n\nThey were the best of times, they were the best of times\n\nThey were the best of times, they were the best of times\n\nOf your life\n\n\n\nOnce upon before we were brilliant and bored\n\nTwo dashes of the bitters, add some ice and you pour\n\n\n\nDead and gone so long, seventeen so gone\n\nDead and gone so long, seventeen so gone\n\n\n\nIt's the false side of hope, where believers concede\n\nAnd there's only memories when it's over\n\n\n\nSo pour out some liquor, make it an old fashioned\n\nRemember your youth and all that you do, the plank and the passion\n\nThey were the best of times, they were the best of times\n\nThey were the best of times, they were the best of times\n\nOf your life\n\n\n\n(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)\n\nNow it looks like a wasteland\n\n(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)\n\nNot the way that we remember\n\n(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)\n\nOne more sip for the past\n\n(Get boozy, boozy, boozy)\n\nAnd always tip your bartender\n\n\n\nGet boozy, boozy, boozy\n\nGet boozy, boozy, boozy\n\nGet boozy, boozy, boozy\n\nGet boo...\n\n\n\nSo pour out some liquor, make it an old fashioned\n\nRemember your youth and all that you do, the plank and the passion\n\nThey were the best of times, they were the best of times\n\nThey were the best of times, they were the best of times",
