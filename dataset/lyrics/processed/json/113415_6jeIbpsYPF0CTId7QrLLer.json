  "lyrics": "Welcome to the end\r\nOf being alone inside your mind\r\nYou're tethered to another\r\nAnd you're worried all the time\r\nYou always knew the melody\r\nBut you never heard it rhyme\n\nShe's fair and she is quiet, Lord\n\nShe doesn't look like me\n\nShe made me love the morning\n\nShe's a holiday at sea\n\nThe New York streets are busy\n\nAs they always used to be\n\nBut I am the mother of Evangeline\n\n\n\nThe first things that she took from me\n\nWere selfishness and sleep\n\nShe broke a thousand heirlooms\n\nI was never meant to keep\n\nShe filled my life with color\n\nCanceled plans and trashed my car\n\nBut none of that was ever who we are\n\nOutside of my windows\n\nAre the mountains and the snow\n\nI will hold you while you're sleeping\n\nAnd I wish that I could go\n\nAll my roadie friends are out\n\nAccomplishing their dreams\n\nBut I am the mother of Evangeline\n\n\n\nAnd they've still got their morning paper\n\nAnd their coffee and their time\n\nAnd they still enjoy their evenings\n\nWith the skeptics and the wine\n\nOh, but all the wonders I have seen\n\nI will see a second time\n\nFrom inside of the ages\n\nThrough your eyes\n\n\n\nYou are not an accident\n\nWhere no one thought it through\n\nThe world has shit against us\n\nMade us mean to fight for you\n\nAnd when we chose your name\n\nWe knew that you'd fight the power, too\n\nYou're nothing short of magical\n\nAnd beautiful to me\n\nOh, I'll never hit the big time without you\n\nSo they can keep their treasure\n\nAnd their ties to the machine\n\n'Cause I am the mother of Evangeline\n\n\n\nThey can keep their treasure\n\nAnd their ties to the machine\n\n'Cause I am the mother of Evangeline\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nOoh",
