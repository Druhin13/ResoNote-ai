  "lyrics": "I saw you there at night\r\nYour shape appeared in the distance\r\nYour face distorted in the light\r\nAnd out of breath, I closely listened\r\nYour hungry eyes glow with fire\r\nAnd light up my humid hollow\n\nJust like me, the treacherous kind\n\n\n\nThe warning's spelling out your name\n\nThe winds are shifting, are you in?\n\n\n\nOh, oh! You make my waters flow\n\nNow look how tall I grow\n\nI'm not human\n\nOh, oh! With you, it's magical\n\nThe urge is animal\n\nI'm not human\n\n\n\nI felt you take a bite\n\nYour calming voice silently whispered\n\nHow do you see your life in time?\n\nAnd is it worth all of these blisters?\n\nThese broken limbs are worn and tired\n\nBut our words are not yet written\n\nOur ember still burning inside\n\n\n\nThe warning's spelling out your name\n\nAre you ready to begin?\n\nMorning will put out this flame\n\nThe winds are shifting, are you in?\n\n\n\nOh, oh! You make my waters flow\n\nNow look how tall I grow\n\nI'm not human\n\nOh, oh! With you, it's magical\n\nThe urge is animal\n\nI'm not human\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, oh! You make my waters flow\n\nNow look how tall I grow\n\nI'm not human\n\nOh, oh! With you, it's magical\n\nThe urge is animal\n\nI'm not human\n\n\n\nI saw you there at night\n\nYour shape appeared in the distance\n\nYour face distorted in the light",
