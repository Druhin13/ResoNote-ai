  "lyrics": "All hail the pow’r of Jesus’ Name!\r\nLet angels prostrate fall;\r\nBring forth the royal diadem\r\nAnd crown Him Lord of all!\r\nCrown Him with many crowns\n\nThe Lamb upon the throne;\n\nHark! How the heav’nly anthem drowns\n\nAll music but its own!\n\nBring forth the royal diadem\n\nAnd crown Him Lord of all!\n\n\n\nBefore the throne of God above\n\nI have a strong and perfect plea\n\nA great High Priest, whose name is Love\n\nWho ever lives and pleads for me\n\n\n\nAwake, my soul and sing\n\nOf Him Who died for thee\n\nAnd hail Him as thy matchless King\n\nThrough all eternity\n\n\n\nMy name is graven on His hands\n\nMy name is written on His heart;\n\nI know that while in heav'n He stands\n\nNo tongue can bid me thence depart\n\nNo tongue can bid me thence depart\n\n\n\nAll hail the pow’r of Jesus’ Name!\n\nWe at His feet may fall!\n\nWe’ll join the everlasting song\n\nAnd crown Him Lord of all!\n\n\n\nWe’ll join the everlasting song\n\nAnd crown Him Lord of all!",
