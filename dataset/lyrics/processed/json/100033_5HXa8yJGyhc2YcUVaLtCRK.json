  "lyrics": "I check my dome, I straighten my tie\r\nWhose is that looking back at me looking so fly?\r\nI'm like \"Damn, oh, that's me in the mirror!\"\r\nI blow myself a kiss, it's getting hot up in here\r\nI pop the clutch, drop the top on the benz\r\nRoll around the block, cranking up the weeknd\n\nI see one in a hummer and one in a rover\n\nTheir looking straight at me like \"Baby come over\"\n\nThen out comes Seacrest, wanting his keys!\n\nYelling \"Cut the shit kid! I got somewhere to be!\"\n\nI'm like \"Damn, oh, there goes the ladies!\"\n\nDay dreaming on my day job and It's not my Mercedes\n\n\n\nOne day I'm gunna live like a baller\n\nCashing checks, stacking decks, walking taller\n\nSnub you in the club, pretend I don't know ya\n\nI don't know you, like I don't know ya\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, like a baller\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, walking taller\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, like a baller!\n\nLike a baller, like a baller\n\n\n\nI'm gunna take a pill with Mike in Ibiza\n\nI'll be walking down rodeo with a gun and a cheetah\n\nWith 4.7 millions likes on my Instagram\n\nHunnies sending pics of their tits to my DM's!\n\nThen came a slap upside of my head\n\nMy boss said \"Chad this isn't your bed!\"\n\nI'm like \"Damn, oh, this isn't my bed!\"\n\nDaydreaming on my day job wishing that I had cred\n\n\n\nOne day I'm gunna live like a baller\n\nCashing checks, stacking decks, walking taller\n\nSnub you in the club, pretend I don't know ya\n\nI don't know you, like I don't know ya\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, like a baller!\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, walking taller!\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, like a baller!\n\nLike a baller, like a baller\n\n\n\nOh!\n\nI'm sick of this day job killing my game!\n\nI'll have the whole damn world tattooing my name\n\nNo more \"Have a nice day guy, here's your keys!\"\n\nI'll be a household name, like Oprah Winfrey!\n\n\n\nOne day I'm gunna live like a baller\n\nCashing checks, stacking decks, walking taller\n\nSnub you in the club, pretend I don't know ya\n\nI don't know you, like I don't know ya\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, like a baller\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, walking taller\n\nAh ah ah ah ah, like a baller!\n\nLike a baller, like a baller!",
