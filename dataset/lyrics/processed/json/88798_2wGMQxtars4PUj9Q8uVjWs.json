  "lyrics": "Marcelo\r\nWho, nigga?\r\nMan, my trunk sound like this when me and my niggas ride through\r\nGrandmama in your living room, thought that y'all was doomed\r\nIf a sucker hating on me, I'll take his shorty to the moon\n\nAnd don't think that she ever coming back too soon\n\nDon't think I won't sweep a sucker up with the broom\n\nYodaichi, keep me geeky, this no Kiki, that's my boo\n\nPull up with my niggas smoking more than him and you\n\nI give no fuck about your purpose, nigga, I'ma hurt you\n\nIf you pull up moving crazy, I bet we reverse you\n\nI'm from Memphis, Tennessee where they'd rather murk you\n\nMind your business, don't get in it, he might have to dirt you\n\nI'ma only tell the truth, I got the mausoleum view\n\nNigga, who? And that could go for him or you\n\nI tried to keep the peace, but they let the hate through\n\nAnd the tears burn, I'm blowing anger out the roof\n\nAt one point in time, I didn't trust my own truth\n\nI smoke a hundred blunts while I ponder on the truth\n\nNow I understand why they never let me through\n\nNow I understand why I'm nothing like you\n\nDragon Fang Gang, pull up to it, then it's through\n\nNigga, who? I put the sand in his boots\n\nSpace cowboy, platinum-plated on the coupe\n\nI'ma slide through it just to pick up me a few\n\nAnd then I slide off into the Himalayan view\n\nNigga, who?",
