  "lyrics": "The rocks will cry out, the oceans will roar\r\nThe mountains will bow to the name of the Lord\r\nHe is our God, He will be praised\r\nThe idols will fall, the strongholds will break\r\nEvery weapon that forms will shatter and fail\n\nHe is our God, He is our faith\n\n\n\nPraise is the highway to the throne of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the heart of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the move of God\n\n\n\nRevival will come, the Church will awake\n\nHis anthem will drown all other refrains\n\nHe is our song, He forever reigns\n\nHe reigns!\n\n\n\nPraise is the highway to the throne of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the heart of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the move of God!\n\n\n\nLift up your head, fling wide the gates\n\nBreak down the walls with a shout of praise\n\nLift up your voice, pull heaven down\n\nOh, sing like thunder, make His praises loud\n\nLift up your head, fling wide the gates\n\nBreak down the walls with a shout of praise\n\nLift up your voice, pull heaven down\n\nOh, sing like thunder, make His praises loud!\n\n\n\nPraise is the highway to the throne of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the heart of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the move of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the throne of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the heart of God\n\nPraise is the highway to the move of God!",
