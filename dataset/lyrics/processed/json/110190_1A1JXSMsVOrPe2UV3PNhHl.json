  "lyrics": "Do you feel Him in your heartbeat even when you're running?\r\nYou try to drown Him out with your life but you still hear Him calling\r\nWith a voice you’ve never heard but it sounds like home, home\r\nYou try to shut it out but you feel it in your bones\r\nAnd it won't leave you alone\n\nHis love is inescapable\n\nHis presence is unshakable\n\nRight now you don't believe it’s true\n\nA better day is coming\n\nAnd you don't need another place to hide\n\nHe'll find you in your darkest night\n\nHis love is holding on to you\n\nEven when you're running\n\nEven when you're running\n\n\n\nAs a kid you said your prayers, now they're bouncing off the ceiling\n\nThey took your world away when you trusted Him for healing\n\nHe's no stranger to your heartbreak, He knows how it feels to lose, oh\n\nFrom the garden to the cross, He's been chasing after you\n\nHe’s chasing after you\n\n\n\nHis love is inescapable\n\nHis presence is unshakable\n\nRight now you don’t believe it's true\n\nA better day is coming\n\nAnd you don’t need another place to hide\n\nHe'll find you in your darkest night\n\nHis love is holding on to you\n\nEven when you're running\n\nEven when you're running\n\n\n\nYour fear isn’t dark enough\n\nYour pit isn't deep enough\n\nYour lie isn't loud enough\n\nTo keep Him away from you\n\nThe Father made the way for you\n\nThe Son killed the grave for you\n\nLet His Spirit come alive in you\n\nAre you tired of the running?\n\nThe Father made the way for you\n\nThe Son killed the grave for you\n\nLet His Spirit come alive in you\n\nAre you tired of the running?\n\n\n\nHis love is inescapable\n\nHis presence is unshakable\n\nRight now you don't believe it's true\n\nA better day is coming\n\nAnd you don't need another place to hide\n\nHe'll find you in your darkest night\n\nHis love is holding on to you\n\nEven when you're running\n\nEven when you're running\n\n\n\nIt's time to stop running now\n\nYou don't have to have it figured out\n\nAll you need to do is turn around\n\nAnd the Father will come running",
