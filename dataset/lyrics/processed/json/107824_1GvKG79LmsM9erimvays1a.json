  "lyrics": "I'm trying to keep my feelings close\r\nBut I miss you I suppose\r\nIt's from my fingers to our toes\r\nThere are secrets no one knows\r\nIt's just a disguise, a little white lie\r\nDigging a hole to find out\n\n\n\nWho am I behind your eyes?\n\n\n\nLove, don't let me go\n\nIf you feel the glow, out from the cold\n\nIf you love me tell me so (oh)\n\n\n\nI double dare to say it first\n\nThe only thing we've never heard\n\nI knew it from the day I met you\n\nI'd hang on all your every word\n\nI may not have much, But I have enough\n\nSo when you're alone do I cross your mind?\n\n'Cause you're always in mine\n\n\n\nOh love, don't let me go\n\nIf you feel the glow, out from the cold\n\nIf you love me tell me so\n\nThere's a world outside that's waiting for you, oh\n\nYou know I can't make your mind for you\n\n\n\nSo who am I behind your eyes?\n\nLove, Don't let me go\n\nIf you feel the glow, out from the cold\n\n\n\nIf you love me, tell me so\n\nDon't let me go\n\nIf you feel the glow, out from the cold\n\nIf you love me tell me so\n\n(don't you let me, don't you let me go, if you feel it)\n\nIf you love me tell me so\n\n(don't you let me, don't you let me go, if you feel it)\n\n\n\nIf you love me tell me so",
