mmh\r\nAimin' at a date, aimin' at a Wraith, aimin' at a gate\r\nShit, me, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake\n\nI bought me a Benz, it came with a shank\n\nI fuck on your friends, I fuck on your bae\n\nEvery time I pretend, it came with a bait (Uh-huh)\n\nI was in a Royce, I was seeing space\n\n'Bouta fuck a bitch brain, my Benz late\n\nBitch, you ain't my sensei\n\nYou could use my nut to cleanse your face\n\n\n\nBitch, drink my nut like E&J\n\nI was fucked up bro, had to reinstate (Uh-huh)\n\nLook and see I'm straight\n\nMe, Sex, and Wave got birthday cake (Uh-huh)\n\nGotta keep an AK\n\nThese niggas play games like arcade (Uh-huh)\n\nPull up in a Porsche\n\nSee you're unloyal, had to part ways (Uh-huh)\n\n\n\nI drip on my dawg's stage\n\nI brought this shit down at the Barclays (Uh-huh)\n\nI fucked her at Ross place\n\nI ran it up, fillin' my dawg's safe (Uh-huh)\n\nCashed out on some dog, yay\n\nYou niggas was taught to follow the way (Uh-huh)\n\nI blocked a thot today\n\nStop blowing up my number and stalkin' my page (Uh-huh)\n\nI got a thot, uh, I got a thot, hey\n\nIf I leave the spot, I go to the yacht, hey\n\nNew Gucci stocks, cover her twat, hey\n\nGivenchy socks, dress up the spot, hey\n\nJeepers creepers, the gators got measles, shit\n\nI fucked up the bank, bought a rose gold shank, yeah\n\nNo realer than this\n\nDunk with the assist, we hit us a lick (Lick)\n\nSlime in that bitch\n\nI went and got rich, my necklace glist' (Yeah)\n\nTwo hundred a fist\n\nOne hundred my bitch, I'm real as it get (Uh huh)\n\nTalkin' that shit, I hope

Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake\n\nMe, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake\n\nWe done made a few M's and I'm straight\n\nGot me a mil', it fit my plate\n\nShit, the teeth on plastic plate\n\nJust 'cause I listen don't mean I debate, uh\n\nI don't got no time to be late\n\nI done missed a few mils, got some buried in the lake\n\nHey, constantly dodging the grave\n\nThe world is a cage, the Planet of Apes (Planet)\n\nGotta keep the family straight\n\nWe know what it takes, the slimiest snakes, uh\n\nI done ran up a whole mil'\n\nI'm chubby, but shit, my pockets in shape, uh\n\nGot racks all inside the safe\n\nIf I run out of space, stay booked out of state\n\n\n\nTop off the Benz, the one with no space\n\nIt's drivin' itself, hit the gas and the brakes\n\nI had her bent inside of the Wraith\n\nBesides the tint, the curtain in the way\n\nI had to sprint all way to the end\n\nI lost some old friends, couldn't keep up the pace\n\nCopped the new Lam' and put it on land\n\nThese fuck niggas mad, I see it in they face\n\nThe jet that I'm on, it's sponsored by Wraith\n\nI'm dodging the rain and I'm dodging the hate\n\nI don't need a pass 'cause I'm not in school\n\nYou playin', you gon' be another cold case\n\nMy diamonds gon' dance, they come and enhance\n\nMy dick in her hand, I bet it get ate\n\nI spent sixty bands on one of my cases\n\nThe paperwork in, my co-D is safe\n\nYSL, we the guys\n\nWe murder him and his tribe\n\nI show you around like I Spy\n\nThis city is mine 'til I die, ah\n\nPatek the rock, ah\n\nSoon up, we shoot at your spot, ah\n\nPerfectly aim for the top, ah\n\nFuckin' your ho 'til she tired, yeah\n\nYeah, just look at these rocks, uh\n\nLil' mama got top, it's wet as a mop, whoa\n\nI creep in the spot\n\nIt's knock knock zoom, he on the way out\n\nGot too many vibes\n\nShe feelin' my brother, we swiggity-swap (Thugger)\n\nKeep sendin' him Dots\n\nI'm gon' free my cousin, I won't let him rot\n\nYou sent me a dyke\n\nI fucked her so good, I got her back right\n\nIt's locked, and she got shark jaws\n\nBut I never want the key to the heart, nah\n\nShe say my music art\n\nAnd love it when I'm rappin' with a guitar\n\nWe really came from the A\n\nMy shit flowin', havin' plenty of bars\n\n\n\nMe, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake\n\nMe, Gunna, and Wheezy, that's a three-headed snake\n\nWe done made a few M's and I'm straight\n\nGot me a mil', it fit my plate\n\nShit, the teeth on plastic plate\n\nJust 'cause I listen don't mean I debate, uh\n\nI don't got no time to be late\n\nI done missed
