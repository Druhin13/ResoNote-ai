  "lyrics": "They're gonna take your money\r\nThey're gonna break your heart\r\nGonna wake up quarter past one wondering where they are\r\n\r\nThey'll leave you second guessing exactly what you did\n\nOoh, having kids\n\n\n\nSometimes they're little angels\n\nThen they're Genghis khan\n\nThey think that they know everything\n\nThen they can't get their pants back on\n\n\n\nThat family in the picture ain't exactly what it is\n\nOoh, having kids\n\n\n\nYou might as well kiss goodbye\n\nThe feeling you might\n\nNever worry about a thing\n\n\n\n'Cause it's good but it's hard\n\nWhen a piece of your heart\n\nBreaks off and grows some wings\n\n\n\nOne more kiss, please, daddy\n\nBefore you say goodnight\n\nThe way she keeps on smiling when you walk her down the aisle\n\n\n\nYou'll take every heartache\n\n'Cause it don't get better than this\n\nOoh, having kids\n\n\n\nOoh, having kids",
