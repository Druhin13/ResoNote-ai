  "lyrics": "Go!\r\nBlink of an eye \nIt can describe \nHow long we've stood tall faced defeat \nAnd all because \n\nWe can recall \n\nThere is no value in deceit \n\nIntent destroyed \n\nAnd left devoid \n\nWhen one embraces their conceit \n\nBut lifting up with power makes their failure complete \n\n\n\nWe're better than we used to be \n\nBut we still have so far to go \n\n\n\nWon't be broken we won't live in the past \n\nNo we won't be broken we have come too far for that \n\nNo we won't be broken we'll live what's in our hearts \n\nNo we won't be broken we're free \n\n\n\nNow time will tell \n\nIf in this hell \n\nWe can believe in what we see \n\nSo take away the power from the elite \n\n\n\nWe're better than we used to be \n\nBut we still have so far to go \n\n\n\nWon't be broken we won't live in the past \n\nNo we won't be broken we have come too far for that \n\nNo we won't be broken we'll live what's in our hearts \n\nNo we won't be broken we're free \n\n\n\nBring it down \n\nMake their failure complete \n\nMake their failure complete \n\n\n\nWon't be broken we won't live in the past \n\nNo we won't be broken we have come too far for that \n\nNo we won't be broken we'll live what's in our hearts \n\nNo we won't be broken we're free\n\n\n\nWe're free\n\nWe're free\n\nWon't be broken we won't live in the past\n\nWe're free...",
