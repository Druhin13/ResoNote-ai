  "lyrics": "Well the music was sad\r\nThe widows all dressed in black and we sang\r\nTold stories all about the good ole days\r\nThere were hugs to give and a few more tears to cry\r\nThen we closed the lid and we gave him one last ride\r\nAnd we laid him in the ground\n\nAnd headed back to town\n\n\n\nThere were casseroles and pecan pies\n\nMama's sweet tea and beer on ice\n\nHell of a way to say goodbye I guess\n\nPreacher clears his throat and then he said\n\nEverybody bow your heads\n\nAnd just like that everything was blessed\n\nSo here's to death, dyin' and deviled eggs\n\n\n\nYeah such is life\n\nWe're all at the mercy of a butter knife on a plate\n\nCheckered table cloth and I'll fly away\n\nKeep in mind that it always ends the same\n\nAnd there's no love like no potluck left to say\n\nAnd they'll lay you in the ground\n\nAll headed back to town\n\n\n\nAnd those casseroles and pecan pies\n\nMama's sweet tea and beer on ice\n\nHell of a way to say goodbye I guess\n\nPreacher clears his throat and then he says\n\nEverybody bow your heads\n\nAnd just like that everything is blessed\n\nSo here's to death, dyin' and deviled eggs\n\n\n\nIf you wanna go to heaven\n\nBetter have Jesus in your soul\n\nMake damn well sure\n\nThat you get plenty before you go\n\n\n\nThose casseroles and pecan pies\n\nMama's sweet tea and beer on ice\n\nHell of a way to say goodbye I guess\n\nPreacher clears his throat and then he says\n\nEverybody bow your heads\n\nAnd just like that everything is blessed\n\nYeah just like that everything is blessed\n\nSo here's to death, dyin' and deviled eggs\n\n\n\nYeah here's to death\n\nHere's to dyin'\n\nGotta love them deviled eggs",
