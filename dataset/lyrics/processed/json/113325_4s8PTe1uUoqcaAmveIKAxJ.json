  "lyrics": "Look in the mirror\r\nFamiliar figure\r\nStaring right back at me\r\nSplit decision\r\nNow my reflections talking\r\nBut I didn't speak\n\nHe said oh my god you're piecing it together\n\nYou are just a shadow of me\n\nOh my lord you've never left the mirror\n\nYou were never ever free\n\nBut tonight, you will play the tambourine\n\n\n\nYou will be the chosen master\n\nYou will leave with the girl this time\n\nYou will be the leading actor\n\nMovie of your own design\n\nAnd when you hit disaster\n\nThe answer will be yours to find\n\nYou're the mirror's master\n\nNow forever I'm resigned\n\n\n\nTake in the vision\n\nMy imperfections shatter in the crater of me\n\nAnother shadow slips in to the chateau\n\nHoping that I cannot see\n\nI said oh my god I'm piecing it together\n\nYou were just a memory\n\nOh my lord you never left the mirror\n\nYou were never ever free\n\nBut tonight you will play the tambourine\n\n\n\nYou will be the chosen master\n\nYou will leave with the girl this time\n\nYou will be the leading actor\n\nMovie of your own design\n\nAnd when you hit disaster\n\nThe answer will be yours to find\n\nYou're the mirror's master\n\nNow forever I'm resigned\n\n\n\nYou will be the chosen master\n\nYou will leave with the girl this time\n\nYou will be the leading actor\n\nMovie of your own design\n\nAnd when you hit disaster\n\nThe answer will be yours to find\n\nYou're the mirror's master\n\nNow forever I'm resigned\n\n\n\nCuz now forever I'm resigned\n\nNow forever I'm resigned",
