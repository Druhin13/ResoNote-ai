  "lyrics": "Last night when my psyche's subcommittee sang to me in it's scary voice\r\nYou slowly dropped your eyelids\r\nWhen true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice\r\nAnd in response to what you whispered in my ear\r\nI must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too\n\n\n\nThe leader of the free world reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks\n\nHe's got himself a theme tune\n\nThey play it for him as he makes his way to the ring\n\n\n\nAnd in response to what you whispered in my ear\n\nI must admit sometimes I fantasize about you too\n\n\n\nIn the daytime, bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies\n\nSummat else to publicise\n\nI'm sure you've heard about enough\n\n\n\nSo in response to what you whispered in my ear\n\nI'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasize about you too",
