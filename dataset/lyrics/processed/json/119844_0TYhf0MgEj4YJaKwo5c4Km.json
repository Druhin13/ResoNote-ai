  "lyrics": "You love to be a trouble maker\r\nLeaving me now then fuck me later\r\nIt's always later, later, later, later\r\nAnd I let you come back 'cause sticking 'round is in my nature\r\nAnd tolerating bad behaviour\r\nYou know that I do that\n\nYou love that I do that\n\n\n\nYou, you know my weaknesses\n\nYou banking a break of my rules\n\nYes you take advantage, know how to manage my whole fucking planet\n\n\n\nYou've been playing wicked games\n\nYou know what to do to me\n\nI tried to stay steady, I'ma leave\n\nBut you try to make me misbehave\n\nFucking up my energy\n\nOne day I'll be over all them wicked games, yeah\n\n\n\nAlways show up when I'm fiending\n\nAnd in the moment it's appealing\n\nBut you're so good disappearing\n\nAnd I'm just so bad at the truth\n\n\n\nYou know my weaknesses\n\nYou banking a break of my rules\n\nYes you take advantage, know how to manage my whole fucking planet\n\n\n\nYou've been playing wicked games\n\nYou know what to do to me\n\nI tried to stay steady, I'ma leave\n\nBut you try to make me misbehave\n\nFucking up my energy\n\nOne day I'll be over all them wicked games, yeah yeah yeah\n\n\n\nI keep holding on, I keep holding on\n\nWonder who you are without all the games, yeah yeah\n\nI keep holding on, I keep holding on\n\nWonder who you are without all them games, yeah\n\nI keep holding on, I keep holding on\n\nWonder who you are without all the games\n\nI keep holding on, I keep holding on\n\nWonder who you are without all them games\n\n\n\nYou've been playing wicked games\n\nYou know what to do to me\n\nI tried to stay steady, I'ma leave\n\nBut you try to make me misbehave\n\nFucking up my energy\n\nOne day I'll be over all them wicked games, yeah yeah",
