  "lyrics": "I'm facing back to front\r\nOver my shoulder at the sun\r\nAnd it's an open door\r\nEnd of my line of sight once more\r\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\nIt'll all be fine this time\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\nCos you always seemed so kind\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\nIt'll all be fine this time\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\n\n\nI'm feeling in and out\n\nI turn full circle round and round\n\nSo will you help me down\n\nCome grab my hand for solid ground\n\n\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\nIt'll all be fine this time\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\nCos you always seemed so kind\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\nIt'll all be fine this time\n\nAnd I don't learn, no I don't learn\n\n\n\nAnd you won't let me, won't let me down\n\nAnd you won't let me, won't let me down\n\nNo you won't let me, won't let me down down down\n\n\n\nHelp me out, don't let me down\n\nI could learn from you, I could learn from you\n\nHelp me out, don't let me down\n\nI could learn from you, I could learn from you\n\nHelp me out, don't let me down\n\nI could learn from you, I could learn from you",
