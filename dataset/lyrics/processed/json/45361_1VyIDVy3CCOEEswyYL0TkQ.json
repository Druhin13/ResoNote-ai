  "lyrics": "Here by the Door\r\nWith my heart on the floor\r\nWhispered words that you said, spin like records in my head\r\nTheres no light in this lonely room\r\nWithout you...\n\n\n\nAnd ill never dance again...\n\nDance again\n\nAnd ill never Dance Again\n\nTil you dance again with me\n\nI refuse to move my feet\n\nTil your back with me\n\nI’ll never dance again\n\nI’m going to stand till i can stone\n\nI refuse to dance alone\n\nThat’s how its gonna be\n\n\n\nLight on my feet, used to feel like i was floating\n\nNow look at me, like a statue standing frozen\n\nThere’s no beat in this broken heart\n\nWhile we’re apart\n\n\n\nAnd ill never dance again...\n\nTil you dance again with me\n\nI refuse to move my feet\n\nTil your back with me\n\nI’ll never dance again\n\nI’m going to stand till i can stone\n\nI refuse to dance alone\n\nThat’s how its gonna be\n\n\n\nNothing’s gonna move me\n\nMove me the way you do\n\nSo it looks like I won't be moving\n\nAnytime soon...\n\n\n\nIll never dance again...\n\nTil you dance again with me\n\nI refuse to move my feet\n\nTil your back with me\n\nI’ll never dance again\n\nI’m going to stand till i can stone\n\nI refuse to dance alone\n\nThat’s how its gonna be\n\n\n\nIll never dance again...\n\nNothings going to move me\n\nMove me the way you do",
