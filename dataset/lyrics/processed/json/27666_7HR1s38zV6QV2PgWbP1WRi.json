  "lyrics": "Did I offend you?\r\nI was only playing games\r\nWe could start from the top and tear it down again\r\nYou were appointed the master of control\r\nIt won't give you self control, you're only getting older\r\nYou're only getting older\n\n\n\nIs this the part where you stumble in?\n\nYou're only breaking down again\n\nOnly fools will let crows win\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nOoo yeah\n\n\n\nRunning with the masses, you're only getting fatter and paid\n\nSouls are what could break, your skin is only walls for some odd days\n\nIs this the part where it comes to an end?\n\nYou're only breaking down again\n\nOnly fools will let crows win\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nOoo yeah\n\n\n\nCreeps on the other side\n\nDon't let them tell you what to find\n\nKeep them where they lie\n\nKeep them there\n\nKeep them out of mind\n\n\n\nIs this the part where you stumble in?\n\nYou're only breaking down again\n\nAnd only fools will let crows win\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nYou're only breaking down\n\nOoo yeah",
