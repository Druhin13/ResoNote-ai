  "lyrics": "Came into this world, I was lost not found\r\nIt did not hold me in its arms like it holds me now\r\nSo I dreamed myself a bird who could cross the waves\r\nAnd I woke up just a man who was miles away\r\nMiles away, miles away, miles away, miles away\n\n\n\nSo I went to Cape Canaveral and I went to the moon\n\nAnd I stayed up there for a year or two\n\nFamous picture of me above the blue parade\n\nA man a million miles up, still miles away\n\n\n\nMiles away, miles away, miles away, miles away\n\n\n\nSo I went back to Kansas, it was summertime\n\nBrought flowers to my family by the riverside\n\nAt the end of his life, they said my father had changed\n\nI suppose we could have been friends, but I was miles away\n\n\n\nMiles away, miles away, miles away, miles away\n\n\n\nHoney, you don't belong in a place like this\n\nWith your long yellow hair and your hips\n\nBut the look in your eye is like the world from space\n\nThe way the sun hits off the water from miles away\n\n\n\nMiles away, miles away, miles away, miles away\n\n\n\nHoney, can you leave your light on?\n\nHoney, can you leave your light on?\n\nHoney, can you leave your light on?\n\nHoney, can you leave your light on?\n\nI'm miles away, miles away\n\nMiles away, miles away",
