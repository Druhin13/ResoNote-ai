  "lyrics": "Hotels and cigarettes\r\nAnd empty bars where I just sit \nAnd contemplate the things that I can't know\r\nAnd all I ask of you are honest words\r\nSimple truths\n\nA place to lay my head when I get lost\n\n\n\nNothing here is right\n\nGuess I'll shut my eyes\n\n\n\nCome to California 'cause I've been lonely for you\n\nWe can stay up all night just to watch the sunrise\n\nCome to California\n\nNothing's right without you and even in the daylight \n\nWell I can't see the sky\n\n\n\nI watch the waves disappear beneath the boardwalk\n\nThen I blink my eyes\n\nStare farther down the beach\n\n\n\nI'll get drunk this time on moons far and wide\n\nIn my defence I'd like to say at least it's always sweet\n\n\n\nNothing here is tight\n\nGuess I'll shut my eyes\n\n\n\nCome to California 'cause I've been lonely for you\n\nWe can stay up all night just to watch the sunrise\n\nCome to California\n\nNothing's right without you and even in the daylight \n\nWell I can't see the sky\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know if I believe I'm everything I should be\n\nIf I'd never been for you\n\n\n\nLove \n\nI am drowning in this change\n\nIt's washing everything I know and am confident with\n\nAh\n\n\n\nCome to California 'cause I've been lonely for you\n\nWe can stay up all night just to watch the sunrise\n\nCome to California \n\nNothing's right without you and even in the daylight \n\nWell I can't see the sky\n\nI can't see the sky\n\n\n\nCome to California 'cause I've been lonely for you\n\n(I can't see the sky)\n\nWe can stay up all night just to watch the sunrise\n\n(Lord I can't see the sky)\n\nCome to California\n\nNothing's right without you and even in the daylight \n\n(I can't see it)\n\n(I can't see it)\n\nWell I can't see the sky\n\n(I can't see it)",
