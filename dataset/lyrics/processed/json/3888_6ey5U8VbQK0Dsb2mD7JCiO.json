  "lyrics": "Looking around at twenty-two\r\nAnd so tired of myself around you\r\nMaybe I don’t fit your ideals anymore\r\nOr maybe I just grew up into a bore\r\nI knew that I shouldn’t call you\n\nBut in this light we are all blue\n\nI just want to feel like I'm\n\nNeatly designed\n\n\n\nLike a telephone pole\n\nI want to feel whole\n\nDo you want to go on a date?\n\nOr would that be hard to orchestrate?\n\n\n\nWhen you close your dreamy eyes\n\nAre they even close to dreaming of mine?\n\nYou could take me and my apathy\n\nTurn us into clarity",
