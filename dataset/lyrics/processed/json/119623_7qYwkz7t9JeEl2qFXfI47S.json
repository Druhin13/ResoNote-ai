  "lyrics": "Sometimes, I wouldn't mind if I was less important\r\nWould you think about them all the time?\r\nWonder if you'll even notice in the morning\r\nSo where'd you go when you can't get to me\r\nAnd you just can't control?\r\nSometimes, I wouldn't mind if I was less important\n\n\n\nBut I've got you to let me down\n\nI've got you to let me down\n\nOnly you can understand why\n\nI've got you to let me down\n\n\n\nYeah, yo, it's like\n\nYou've got me, I'm pondering that\n\nSaid, \"I'll be back in a sec, I need to reflect\"\n\nBut you swear it's been longer than that\n\nTime is golden, time is thin\n\nBut time is rare, so we squander and that\n\nI feel your pain when I hear your voice\n\nSo fix your tone, man, you're stronger than that\n\nAnd you're, like, the strongest girl I know\n\nProbably the strongest, minus my mum\n\nDon't go wasting your loving on me\n\nWhen I see tears run, I'm likely to run\n\nSo girl, don't love me, I mean it\n\nWhen I say I love you, I mean it\n\nAnd it's mad cuh I choose to be distant\n\nBut it's fucked cuh I know what a queen is\n\nSo why do I?\n\n\n\nBut I've got you to let me down\n\nWhy do you let me down? Why do you let me down, down, down?\n\nI've got you to let me down\n\nSometimes, your world spins 'round\n\nBut you never had a king 'til now\n\nOnly you can understand why\n\nYeah, girl, do you understand\n\nWhy these feelings never come to plan?\n\nI've got you to let me down\n\nI'm never gonna let you down, I'm never gonna let you down\n\n\n\nYeah, I tried, but I just can't give you up\n\nWonder why is it that I'm not good enough?\n\nSome kind of hold over me\n\n\n\nI've got you to let me down\n\nI've got you, you've got me, I've got you\n\nBut I've got you to let me down\n\nIf I let you down, will you self-destruct?\n\nOnly you, only you can understand why\n\nOnly you can understand\n\nThat I've got you to let me down",
