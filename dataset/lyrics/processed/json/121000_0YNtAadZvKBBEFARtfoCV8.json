  "lyrics": "If I don't have you with me, I'm alone\r\nYou know I never know which way to go\r\nI think I need you with me for all-time\r\nWhen I need new direction for my mind\r\nYou listen to my lectures on the phone\r\nYou help me find the treasure in the hole\n\nYou'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool\n\nI know that you're not something to lose, now\n\n\n\nI've got something to confess\n\nI keep you in my pocket to you\n\nYou're my only compass\n\nI might get lost without you\n\n(Could you tell me where to go?)\n\n\n\nYou're always there to help me when I'm down\n\nI'm lucky you've been keeping me around\n\nYou're the star I look for every night\n\nWhen it's dark, you'll stick right by my side\n\n\n\nI've got something to confess\n\nI keep you in my pocket to you\n\nYou're my only compass\n\nI might get lost without you\n\n\n\nLike a magnet\n\nHard to imagine anything changing\n\nAnything changing my way\n\nBaby, like a magnet\n\nCan't help that I'm attracted to you, I am\n\nCould you keep on guiding me?\n\n(Please)\n\n\n\nI've got something to confess\n\nI keep you in my pocket to you\n\nYou're my only compass\n\nI might get lost without you\n\n(I might get lost without you)\n\nI've got something to confess\n\nI might get lost without you\n\nYou're my only compass\n\nI might get lost without you",
