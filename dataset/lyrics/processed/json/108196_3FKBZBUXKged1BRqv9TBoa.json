  "lyrics": "Somewhere out there on that horizon \nOut beyond the neon lights \nI know there must be somethin' better \nbut there's nowhere else in sight \nIt's survival in the city \nWhen you live from day to day \n\nCity streets don't have much pity \n\nWhen you're down, that's where you'll stay \n\nIn the city, oh, oh. \n\nIn the city \n\n\n\nI was born here in the city \n\nWith my back against the wall \n\nNothing grows, and life ain't very pretty \n\nNo one's there to catch you when you fall \n\nSomewhere out on that horizon \n\nFaraway from the neon sky \n\nI know there must be somethin' better \n\nAnd I can't stay another night \n\nIn the city, oh, oh. \n\nIn the city",
