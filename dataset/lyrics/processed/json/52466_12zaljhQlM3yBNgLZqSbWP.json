  "lyrics": "A spirit seeks to rise above\r\nBut the routine brings it down\r\nMind is eager to open wide\r\nBut constraint's gotta cork it up\r\nUp to the tomb of broken dreams\n\nDown to the top of false believes\n\nUp to the cooling iron core\n\nDown to the stairs that lead to the heaven's door\n\n\n\nUp, down. If there's no difference\n\nDown, up. Let's levitate between plus and minus\n\nOf all the sins people possess\n\nIndifference must be the deadliest\n\n\n\nDecide!\n\n\n\nDecompose into good and evil\n\nDivide chaos and order\n\nSeparate hot from cold\n\nDisjoint light and darkness\n\nPlus and minus\n\n\n\nNo more duality\n\nThe vision of what is right becomes crystal clear\n\nNo bipolarity\n\nThe vision of what is right becomes crystal clear\n\nNo bipolarity\n\nThe vision of what is right becomes crystal clear\n\nNo more duality\n\nThe vision of what is right is not crystal clear\n\n\n\nFind all the answers to the question never asked\n\nDon't skip the blanks. Plus or minus?\n\nFind all the answers to the question never asked\n\nDon't skip the blanks. Plus or minus?\n\nPlus or minus?\n\n\n\nNo, no more duality\n\nThe vision of what is right becomes crystal clear\n\nNo bipolarity\n\nThe vision of what is right becomes crystal clear\n\nNo bipolarity\n\nThe vision of what is right becomes crystal clear\n\nNo more duality\n\nThe vision of what is right is not crystal clear\n\n\n\nМинус... плюс\n\nПлюс... минус\n\nMinus... plus\n\nPlus... minus\n\nMinus... plus\n\nPlus... minus\n\nMinus... plus\n\nPlus... minus\n\n\n\nMinus... plus\n\nPlus... minus\n\nMinus... plus\n\nPlus... minus\n\nMinus... plus\n\nPlus... minus\n\nMinus... plus",
