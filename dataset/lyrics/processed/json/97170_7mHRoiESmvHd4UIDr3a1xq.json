Tell me what you heard\n\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\n\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\n\nWhat's the word? Tell me what you heard\n\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\n\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\n\n\n\nWhat you mean, you and me? I'm here all by myself\n\nYou around, she's around, just be polite and I'll leave for a hour\n\nThe fuck you call this? Hopeless, not romantic\n\nI ain't got no kids so don't be so childish\n\nYou wildin', I be wildin' too\n\nAnd I like you, said, baby, look like you\n\nMaybe we ain't so different, maybe I be trippin' too\n\n\n\nWhat's the word? Tell me what you heard\n\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\n\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\n\nWhat's the word? Tell me what you heard\n\nDon't tell me what to do, just tell me when it hurts\n\nWhen I get you to myself, it's murder\n\n\n\nYou ain't gotta worry\n\n'Bout nothin', nothin'\n\n'Bout nothin', babe\n\nYou ain't gotta worry\n\nWorry 'bout nothin', nothin'\n\nYou ain't gotta worry\n\n'Bout nothin', nothin'\n\n\n\nIf he was a winner, girl, you wouldn't have to worry 'bout a damn thing\n\nIf I was up in it, shit, I bet a pound that I'd put it down\n\nLike you'd forget that you was ever with him\n\nAnd I hate talkin' 'bout my stroke game\n\nBut girl, I'm givin' you the whole thing\n\nI could put like twenty five on your finger, five for your shades\n\nSo you can't see these other niggas, they won't call you again\n\nThat's enough, I can see you're wastin' time\n\n'Fore you pay it out to me, know when the romp ends\n\n\n\nI just wanna climb in, night and day, wanna stay\n\nI'll be more open so keep it open\n\nGimme that",
