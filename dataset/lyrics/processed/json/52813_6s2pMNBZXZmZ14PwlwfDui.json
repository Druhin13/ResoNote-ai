  "lyrics": "While all the time that I was loving you\r\nYou were busy loving yourself\r\nI would stop breathing if you told me to\r\nNow your busy loving someone else\r\n11 years out of my life\r\nBesides the kids I have nothing to show\n\nWasted my years a fool of a wife\n\nI shoulda have left your ass a long time ago\n\n\n\n[1] - Well I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry\n\nI'm not gon' shed no tears\n\nNo, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time \n\nCuz your not worth my tears\n\nWell I'm not gon' cry, I'm not gon' cry\n\nI'm not gon' shed no tears\n\nNo, I'm not gon' cry, it's not the time\n\nCuz you're not worth my tears\n\n\n\n[2] - I was your lover and your secretary\n\nWorking every day of the week\n\nWas at the job when no one else was there\n\nHelping you get on your feet\n\n11 years of sacrifice\n\nAnd you can leave at the drop of a dime\n\nSwallowed my fears, stood by your side\n\nI shoulda left your ass a thousand times\n\n\n\n[Repeat 1]\n\n\n\nI know there are no guarantees\n\nIn love you take your chances\n\nBut somehow it seems unfair to me\n\nLook at the circumstances\n\nThrough sickness and health, 'till death do us part\n\nThose were the words that we said from our heart\n\nSo now that you say that you're leaving me\n\nI don't get that part\n\n\n\n[Repeat 2]\n\n\n\n[Repeat 1 until fade]",
