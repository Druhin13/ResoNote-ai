  "lyrics": "In a half hour, I'll be fine\r\nThe next 29 minutes are gonna flow like concrete\r\nMy heart'll get so low, it can touch my feet\r\nSo just leave me alone, there's nothin' I need\r\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\n\n\nWe'll admit the lows keep me alive\n\nIf it wasn't for the changes, I would probably die\n\nLike how the dark never seems that dark when it's finally light\n\nMy concentration is a knot, my depression keeps it tight and\n\n\n\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\n\n\nI'm like the cold dead winter, finally looking for the spring and\n\nYou're the nice warm sun, you give birth to everything\n\n\n\nLike a patient coming out of surgery, I remember how to feel\n\nLike a traumatized victim, the past half hour wasn't real\n\nWasn't real and\n\n\n\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\nI'll feel better\n\n\n\nSo make up lies, and convince yourself they're true\n\nWho am I to tell you what to do?\n\n\n\nIn a half hour, I'll be fine (I'll be fine)\n\nThe next 29 minutes are gonna flow like concrete",
