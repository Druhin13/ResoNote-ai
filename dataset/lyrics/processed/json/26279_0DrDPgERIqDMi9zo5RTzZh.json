  "lyrics": "Both knees, I saw you grazing at the floor\r\nNosebleeds, there's always more to your one more\r\nSheer delight as you unwind, as you unwind\r\nI think I saw some self belief through gritted teeth tonight\r\nFall over, we don't need another drink\n\nFall over, this goes more quickly then you think\n\nA sugar cube in water: is that all you think this is?\n\nYour life in your fingertips\n\n\n\nAnd what was that you said?\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nJust one match to burn this whole thing down\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nJust one match to burn this whole thing down\n\n\n\nStop signs, they're blood red, you're colorblind\n\nYour lifeline weaves and snakes around your every whim\n\nNot rehabilitation, call it learning how to swim\n\nWe're just learning how to swim\n\n\n\nAnd what was that you said?\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nJust one match to burn this whole thing down\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nJust one match to burn down\n\n\n\nEverything you promise is swept up by the wind\n\nAnd I could try to love you, but where do I begin?\n\n\n\nAnd what was that you said?\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nSo lonely\n\nWe are so lonely\n\nJust one match to burn, burn, burn\n\n\n\nAnd everything you promise is swept up by the wind\n\nAnd I could try to love you, but where do I begin?",
