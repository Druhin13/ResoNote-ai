  "lyrics": "Standing on the steps thinking I could try again\r\nOr I could tear this all apart\r\nI don't need you now, like I did back then\r\nI just don't want to fall too hard\r\nBut this is how it goes\n\nWhen you let it back in\n\nThis is how it goes\n\nAnd this is how it goes\n\nWhen you're defined by it\n\nThis is how it goes\n\n\n\nI can be alone, I could be myself again\n\nI don't have to play a part\n\nGetting offered sex even though you're waiting [?]\n\nI just don't want to go that far\n\n\n\nBut this is how it goes\n\nWhen you lose lovers and friends\n\nThis is how it goes\n\nAnd this is how it goes\n\nWhen your means become hands\n\nThis is how it goes\n\n\n\nAnd I hear a voice as sweet as before\n\nIt's been the same from the start\n\nOh just this once, and just this once more\n\nI watched this all fall apart\n\n\n\nBut this is how it goes\n\nWhen you let it back in\n\nThis is how it goes\n\nAnd this is how it goes\n\nWhen your defined by it\n\nThis is how it goes\n\nGoes",
