  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\nOnly way to fly is to jump\r\nMama preachin' and they speakin' to us, common sense\r\nLook around, neighborhood like the apoocalypse\r\nWanna reach the top, no money for that rocket ship\n\nAnd he don't think he'll get no scholarship\n\nSo he drop out, people tellin' him it's just a cop out\n\nAmerican dream, picture perfect, he been cropped out\n\nBills at the house past due, what else to do\n\nThey don't know what he been through\n\nHow they gon' tell him how to move\n\nBorn to lose-lose, no avenues left to chose\n\nBruised and abused, persecuted and accused\n\nMoney he pursued, poverty he refused\n\nWalkin' outta school with a fucking attitude\n\n\n\nSome day you'll look around and regret what you've become\n\nNever spread your wings to leave that place that you were from\n\nStars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun\n\nFly high young one, it could end before it's begun\n\n\n\nHe's writin' songs about the pain he feel inside\n\nBut ain't no rapper ever made it from the west side\n\nHis is a silly dream, reality is brutal\n\nLost three homies in three weeks from gang shootin's\n\nTry to get out, it's just useless\n\nThey say his only option is a factory or prison institution\n\nHe wanna fly, but he afraid to jump\n\nPlus, he can't afford it, his old lady got that baby bump\n\nTime to grind, gotta let go of his wants, provide for their needs\n\nTime to be a man, grow some roots, plant a seed\n\nGet a 9-5, hustle on the side\n\nLet go of all the foolishness and kiss the dream goodbye\n\n\n\nSome day you'll look around and regret what you've become\n\nNever spread your wings to leave that place that you were from\n\nStars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun\n\nFly high young one, it could end before it's begun\n\n\n\nSeven kids, a couple prison years later\n\nI decided to quit listening to haters\n\nTook from the 'hood everything that made us\n\nGod won't forsake us and the Feds couldn't break us\n\nPromised greater for my baby's fate than hard labor\n\nNow I'm living in the mansion saving for some acres\n\nSame people said I couldn't, askin' if I can\n\nGive a helping hand, loan a couple grand\n\nNever fake it for a second 'cause we been through real shit\n\nThe moral of the story, what you want you can get\n\nGotta jump you wanna fly, you won't get another life\n\nTwinkle, twinkle little star, go and live your lullaby\n\n\n\nStars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun\n\nFly high young one, it could end before it's begun\n\nStars die in the sky, trying to get close to the sun",
