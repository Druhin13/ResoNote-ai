  "lyrics": "They say that your heart\r\nIs the size of your fist\r\nI can tell you first hand\r\nI know how that glove fits\r\nIt takes your whole life just\r\nTo teach it two tricks:\n\nIt beats and it attacks\n\nAnd in between is all of love\n\nAnd loss, attraction\n\nYou live your life between contractions\n\nAnd you and I we do just that\n\n\n\nWhat if I could cure me of you?\n\nAm I so sure which pill I'd choose?\n\nMaybe I'm happier with half of you\n\nThan I'd be with clean\n\nBut empty rooms\n\nIn the mess it's made of us\n\nThere's still so much to lose\n\n\n\nThe key I swallowed\n\nThe lock you picked\n\nAll these spinning bottles\n\nAnd I'm still the mark you missed\n\nWe should be a settle argument\n\nBut I can't do that\n\nI can't remove the screws\n\nOf my own youth\n\nCan't just pull out all the\n\nFuses and start new\n\nCan't erase and can't undo\n\nMy past with you\n\nAnd I know it's\n\nIt's not the sort of thing you're\n\nSupposed to show if\n\nYou can you're supposed\n\nTo try to let it go, you\n\nJust shoulder what you can\n\nAnd soldier through\n\n\n\nWhat if I could cure me of you?\n\nAm I so sure which pill I'd choose?\n\nMaybe I'm happier with half of you\n\nThan I'd be with clean\n\nBut empty rooms\n\nIn the mess it's made of us\n\nThere's still so much to lose\n\n\n\nI get this feeling\n\nWhen I'm far away from home\n\nThat I don't know\n\nThe girl I'd be if we'd\n\nLeft well enough alone\n\nBut well is well enough?\n\nWhat is well enough alone?",
