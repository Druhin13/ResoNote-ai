  "lyrics": "But I don't believe in ghosts or anything\r\nI know that you are gone and that I'm carrying some version of you around\r\nSome untrustworthy old description in my memories\r\nAnd that must be your ghost taking form\r\nCreated every moment by me dreaming you so\r\nAnd is it my job now to hold whatever's left of you for all time?\n\nAnd to reenact you for our daughter's life?\n\n\n\nI do remember\n\nWhen I was a kid and realized that life ends and is just over\n\nThat a point comes where we no longer get to say or do anything\n\nAnd then what? I guess just forgotten\n\nAnd I said to my mom that I hoped to do something important with my life\n\nNot be famous, but just remembered a little more\n\nTo echo beyond my actual end\n\nMy mom laughed at this kid trying to wriggle his way out of mortality\n\nOf the final inescapable feral scream\n\nBut I held that hope and grew up wondering what dying means\n\nUnsatisfied, ambitious and squirming\n\n\n\nThe first dead body I ever saw in real life was my great-grandfather's\n\nEmbalmed in a casket in Everett in a room by the freeway\n\nWhere they talked me into reading a thing from the Bible\n\nAbout walking through a valley in the shadow of death\n\nBut I didn't understand the words\n\nI thought of actually walking through a valley and a shadow\n\nWith a backpack and a tent\n\nBut that dead body next to me spoke clear and metaphor-free\n\n\n\nIn December 2001\n\nAfter having spent the summer and fall traveling mostly alone around\n\nThe country that was spiraling into war and mania, little flags were everywhere\n\nI was living on the periphery as a twenty-three-year-old\n\nWrapped up in doing what I wanted and it was music and painting on newsprint\n\nAnd eating all the fruit From the tree like Tarzan or Walt Whitman, voracious, devouring life, singing my song\n\nSleeping in yards without asking permission\n\nBut that December I was shaken by a pregnancy scare\n\nFrom someone that I'd been with for only one night\n\nMany states away, who I hadn't planned to keep knowing\n\nA young and embarrassing over-confident animal night\n\nThe terror of the idea of fatherhood at twenty-three destroyed my foundation\n\nAnd left me freaked out and wandering around\n\nMourning the independence and solitude that defined me then\n\nThough my life is a galaxy of subtleties\n\nMy complex intentions and aspirations do not matter at all\n\nIn the face of the crushing flow of actual time\n\nI saw my ancestors as sad and misunderstood\n\nIn the same way that my descendants will squint back through a fog\n\nTrying to see some polluted version of all I meant to be in life\n\nTheir recollections pruned by the accidents of time\n\nWhat got thrown away and what gets talked about at night\n\nBut she had her period eventually and I went back to being twenty-three\n\n\n\nEleven years later I was traveling alone again\n\nOn an airplane from New Zealand to Perth, Western Australia\n\nVery alone, so far away from you and the home that we had made\n\nI watched a movie on the plane about Jack Kerouac\n\nA documentary going deeper than the usual congratulations\n\nThey interviewed his daughter, Jan Kerouac, and she tore through the history\n\nShe told about this deadbeat drinking, watching Three Stooges on TV\n\nNot acknowledging his paternity, abandoning the child\n\nTaking cowardly refuge in his self-mythology\n\nAnd when she spoke I heard your voice telling me about the adults who had\n\nAbandoned you as a sweet kid and left you to grow precariously\n\nAnd when she spoke I looked in her face and saw you looking back at me\n\nOn a tiny airplane seat screen at the bottom of the world\n\nI saw a French-Canadian resemblance\n\nAnd I heard suffering echoing\n\nA lineage of bad parents and strong daughters withstanding\n\nAnd she had black hair and freckles and pale skin just like you\n\nAnd she told the hard truth and slayed the gods just like you\n\nI saw the cracks in the façade of posterity\n\nI missed you so I went home\n\n\n\nThe second dead body I ever saw was you, Geneviève\n\nWhen I watched you turn from alive to dead right here in our house\n\nAnd I looked around the room and asked “Are you here?”\n\nAnd you weren't, and you are not here. I sing to you though\n\nI keep you breathing through my lungs\n\nIn a constant uncomfortable stream of memories trailing out\n\nUntil I am dead too\n\nAnd then eventually the people who remember me will also die\n\nContaining what it was like to stand in the same air with me\n\nAnd breathe and wonder why\n\n\n\nAnd then distortion\n\nAnd then the silence of space\n\nThe Night Palace\n\nThe ocean blurring\n\nBut in my tears right now\n\nLight gleams",
