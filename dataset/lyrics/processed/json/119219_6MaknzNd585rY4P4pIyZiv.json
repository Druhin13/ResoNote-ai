  "lyrics": "I was told this is where I will start loving myself\r\nFlirting's delicious; proved to be beneficial for mental health\r\nAll of my best bits pulled forward, collected, displayed\r\nSadly I just think that I was disgusting, today\r\nYou blew me up like a big balloon far too soon, I'm left to stuttering teeth\n\nHow did I get here? It's all so quick, and I feel sick. Red pushing down on the green\n\n\n\nCould you love this? Will this one be right?\n\nWell if I'm being honest, I'm hoping it might\n\nCould you love this? Did you plan to fall?\n\nWell if I'm being honest, oh I bet it's not that at all\n\n\n\nHope has a cost: keeping all fingers crossed and held tight\n\nBut I look idiotic, with my limbs all knotted, don't feel right\n\nTruly you've shaken me, and I think you like how I plead\n\nAnd I have a hunch, that that's all you wanted from me\n\n\n\nYou blew me up like a big balloon far too soon, holding my breath makes me choke\n\nHow did I get here? It's all so quick, and I feel sick. I’m used to being a joke\n\n\n\nCould you love this? Will this one be right?\n\nWell if I'm being honest, I'm hoping that it might\n\nCould you love this? Did you plan to fall?\n\nWell if I'm being honest, oh I bet it's not that at all\n\n\n\nAll\n\nAll\n\nAll\n\nAll\n\n\n\nCould you love this? Will this one be right?\n\nWell if I'm being honest, I'm hoping that it might\n\nCould you love this? Did you plan to fall?\n\nWell if I'm being honest\n\nWell if I’m being honest\n\nWell if I’m being honest\n\nOh, I bet it's not that at all",
