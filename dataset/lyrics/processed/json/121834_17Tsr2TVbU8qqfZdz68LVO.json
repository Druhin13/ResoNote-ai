  "lyrics": "Maria’s on the hill\r\nShe was all “side of her eyes”\r\nA five-dollar wine as a blanket inside\r\nLay up the pages on a traveling bed\r\nWatch the Blood of Christ Mountains, oh they all turn red\n\nHowl at the half moon, radio queen\n\nShe’s all smoke, she’s all nicotine\n\nThe songs in my pocket just crumble apart\n\nWon’t you sing me something for the dark\n\n\n\nMaria’s got wings, she’s got legs for the sea\n\nA captain’s coat and a note for me\n\nWake up Marie, before the season turns\n\nSet your dash for the coast, watch the Sangres burn\n\n\n\nHowl at the half moon, radio queen\n\nShe’s all smoke, she’s all nicotine\n\nThe songs in my pocket just crumble apart\n\nWon’t you sing me something for the dark, dark, dark",
