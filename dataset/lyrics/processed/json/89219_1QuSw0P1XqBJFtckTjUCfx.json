  "lyrics": "She only holds me in her arms when she's feeling blue\r\nMy baby only holds me in her arms when she's feeling blue\r\nShe sparkles like a diamond and she shines like gold\r\nShe tends to avoid me when her heart is full\r\nYou can find her roaming from dusk 'til dawn\r\nHer tricks and her treasures and her dancing shoes on\n\nShe only holds me in her arms when she's feeling blue\n\nMy baby only holds me in her arms when she's feeling blue\n\nShe calls me up and tells me, \"Honey, I need you\"\n\nAnd I come a-runnin' like I always do\n\n\n\nShe only holds me in her arms when she's feeling blue\n\nMy baby only holds me in her arms when she's feeling blue\n\nThere was a time we rambled â€˜neath that neon moon\n\nHer tricks and her treasures are all that I knew\n\nNow she calls and tells me, \"Honey, I need you\"\n\nAnd I come a-runnin' like I always do",
