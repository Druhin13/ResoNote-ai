  "lyrics": "I was holding on to a branch in the river, so scared of letting go\r\nAnd praying only that someone would stop the flow\r\nI heard a voice like the sound of an ocean - above the river's rush\r\nA song as old as the world, and my heart was hushed\r\nAnd I could hear it calling to me\n\n\"Let go now, it'll be ok\n\nLet go, and let yourself be carried away\n\nLet go of all your uncertainty\n\nLet go, and let yourself be carried to me\"\n\n\n\nStill I clung to that branch in the river, white-knuckled, terrified\n\nAll of my life I'd been warned that the waters lied\n\nSomething changed as the flood rose around me and washed away my fear\n\nAn echo rose from within - it was crystal clear\n\nAnd I could hear it calling to me\n\n\n\n\"Let go now, it'll be ok\n\nLet go, and let yourself be carried away\n\nLet go of all your uncertainty\n\nLet go, and let yourself be carried to me\"\n\nSo I let go\n\n\n\nYou're holding on to that branch in the river, so scared of letting go\n\nYou're praying only that someone would stop the flow\n\nBut hear the voice, it's a chorus in motion - (?) the I and we\n\nWeaving along is the song of the endless sea\n\nThe song that's always calling to you\n\n\n\n\"Let go now, it'll be ok\n\nLet go, and let yourself be carried away\n\nLet go of all your uncertainty\n\nLet go, and let yourself be carried to me\"",
