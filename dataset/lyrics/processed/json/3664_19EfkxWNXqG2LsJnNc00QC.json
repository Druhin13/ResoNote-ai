  "lyrics": "When I was 5 I'd ride my bike faster then the wind\r\nMama said, \"If you don't slow down you're gonna fall right off that thing\"\r\nWell, I learned that the hard way\r\nSneaking out after dark looking for teenage kicks\r\nDaddy said, \"Don't drink too much, it's the worse kind of sin\"\r\nAnd I learned that the hard way\n\n\n\nThe hardest thing I ever learned was\n\n\n\nYou're only gonna know what you've got\n\nWhen you know it's not coming back\n\nYou're only gonna know what to say\n\nWhen it's too little, too late\n\nIt's me and my heart alone in the dark\n\nNow you're gone like you said you'd be gone one day\n\nIf I didn't change\n\nAnd I learned that the hard way\n\n\n\nI should've said 'I love you' more\n\nI should've given you all my time\n\nI should've asked you, \"Baby, what's wrong?\"\n\nWhen you said, \"Everything's fine\"\n\nI knew you were lying\n\nAnd I learned that the hard way\n\n\n\nThe hardest thing I ever learned was\n\n\n\nYou're only gonna know what you've got\n\nWhen you know it's not coming back\n\nYou're only gonna know what to say\n\nWhen it's too little, too late\n\nIt's me and my heart alone in the dark\n\nNow you're gone like you said you'd be gone one day\n\nIf I didn't change\n\nAnd I learned that the hard way\n\n\n\nI only knew how to love you when I lost you\n\nWhen I lost you\n\nYou're only gonna know what you've got\n\nWhen you know it's not coming back\n\nYou're only gonna know what to say\n\nWhen it's too little, too late\n\n\n\nYou're only gonna know what you've got\n\nWhen you know it's not coming back\n\nYou're only gonna know what to say\n\nWhen it's too little, too late\n\nIt's me and my heart alone in the dark\n\nNow you're gone like you said you'd be gone one day\n\nIf I didn't change, if I didn't change\n\nOoh, I should've changed\n\nAnd I learned that the hard way\n\n\n\nI learned that the hard way\n\nI learned that the hard way",
