  "lyrics": "I think you're gonna change my plans\r\nWith those emerald eyes\r\nBut you don't even understand\r\nHow much they're on my mind\r\nFeels like I'm breathing in and out without permission\n\nWaiting on your badges by the phone\n\nI might be headed in the opposite direction\n\nBut I'd love to drive you home\n\n\n\nOh, I'm in trouble now\n\nCome kiss me black and blue\n\nMight last another round\n\nBut I'm bound to fall for you\n\n\n\nTaking a stranger's hand\n\nI got familiarized\n\nNow without a second glance\n\nI wouldn't save the night\n\nI'd spend it all, every penny on you\n\nThere's nothing in my wallet\n\nWorth a thing I can't lose\n\nI'd spend it all, every penny on you-ou\n\n\n\nFeels like I'm breathing in and out without permission\n\nWaiting on your badges by the phone\n\nI might be headed in the opposite direction\n\nBut I'd love to drive you home\n\n\n\nOh, I'm in trouble now\n\nCome kiss me black and blue\n\nMight last another round\n\nBut I'm bound to fall for you\n\nWe're under covers now\n\nI don't know what you do\n\nJust know I love it now\n\nI'm bound to fall for you\n\n\n\nI want you filling my lungs and pulling me under\n\nTip of my tongue, it's making me wonder\n\nFilling my lungs and pulling me under\n\n\n\nI think you're gonna change my plans\n\nWith those emerald eyes\n\nAnd you don't even understand\n\nJust how far I'd dive",
