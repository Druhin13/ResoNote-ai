  "lyrics": "There are days\r\nI wake up and I pinch myself\r\nYou're with me, not someone else\r\nAnd I am scared, yeah, I'm still scared\r\nThat it's all a dream\n\n'Cause you still look perfect as days go by\n\nEven the worst ones, you make me smile\n\nI'd stop the world if it gave us time\n\n\n\n'Cause when you love someone\n\nYou open up your heart\n\nWhen you love someone\n\nYou make room\n\nIf you love someone\n\nAnd you're not afraid to lose 'em\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do\n\n\n\nWhen you say\n\nYou love the way I make you feel\n\nEverything becomes so real\n\nDon't be scared, no, don't be scared\n\n'Cause you're all I need\n\n\n\nAnd you still look perfect as days go by\n\nEven the worst ones, you make me smile\n\nI'd stop the world if it gave us time\n\n\n\n'Cause when you love someone\n\nYou open up your heart\n\nWhen you love someone\n\nYou make room\n\nIf you love someone\n\nAnd you're not afraid to lose 'em\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do\n\n\n\nAll my life\n\nI thought it'd be hard to find\n\nThe one 'til I found you\n\nAnd I find it bittersweet\n\n'Cause you gave me something to lose\n\n\n\nBut when you love someone\n\nYou open up your heart\n\nWhen you love someone\n\nYou make room\n\nIf you love someone\n\nAnd you're not afraid to lose 'em\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do\n\nYou'll probably never love someone like I do",
