  "lyrics": "Sitting in depression\r\nAlways calling me irreverent\r\nIf I prayed the weight would lessen\r\nBut your mouth can do it better\r\nThan some god who don't speak\r\nFucking up my language\n\nMixing words but never fading\n\nIf you stay you'll say you saved me\n\nYou can take it all away\n\nWhen you leave I'll feel the same, hey\n\n\n\nI don't mind you leaving when the damage is done\n\nAnd I don't mind, I feel the same when you're gone\n\n\n\n'Cause what you lost, what you lost\n\nI don't wanna be here anymore, anymore\n\nThere's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone\n\nI'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here\n\n'Cause what you lost, what you lost\n\nI don't wanna be here anymore, anymore\n\nThere's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone\n\nI'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here\n\n\n\nBaby take me back to New York City\n\nWhere the stars don't ever see me\n\nI can hide under the scenery of a saturated sky\n\nShare some conjugated meaning\n\nWatch the light drip down your face\n\nAnd when you'll leave I'll feel the same, ohh\n\n\n\nI don't mind you leaving when the damage is done\n\nAnd I don't mind how I feel the same when you're gone\n\n\n\n\n\n'Cause what you lost, what you lost\n\nI don't wanna be here anymore, anymore\n\nThere's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone\n\nI'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here\n\n'Cause what you lost, what you lost\n\nI don't wanna be here anymore, anymore\n\nThere's no difference here from when you're gone, when you're gone\n\nI'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here\n\n(I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here)\n\n(I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here)\n\n(I'm not crawling on my knees to keep you here)",
