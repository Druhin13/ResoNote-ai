  "lyrics": "Hear my prayer, thee almighty God\r\nFor my mother - bring her home\r\nLike an angel heaven-bound\r\nSo that she may find thy side\r\nDon't sound so sad my child\n\nNo sorrow will provail\n\nSophia knows every word\n\nBe sure of this my child\n\nI have to leave you now\n\nNo wish will be left unheard\n\n\n\nWhat of darkness, Nazarene\n\nDid it haunt your heart?\n\n\n\nWho may he be?\n\nHope in doubt and fear\n\nGolden atmosphere\n\nAnd a cry so divine\n\n\n\nI am the real Messiah, born where Christ did fall\n\nSoon bringing eyes to the blind\n\nHumanity refined, I will unite them all\n\nBecome to the truth for all mankind\n\n\n\nSister of mine - prophets may be false\n\nBeware what you hear and see\n\nTolling bells I find no singing in the chimes\n\n\n\nJoin me sister as I pray:\n\nHear my prayer thee almighty God\n\nFor our mother - bring her home",
