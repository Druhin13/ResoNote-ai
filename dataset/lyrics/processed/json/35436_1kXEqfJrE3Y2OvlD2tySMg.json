  "lyrics": "Is it the journey or the destination?\r\nIs this love or is this addiction?\r\nCircumstances are meant to be\r\nWhat does that say about you and me?\r\nKaraoke on a Monday night\r\nTelevision when we want to hide\n\nFrozen dinners when money's tight\n\nMakin' love on a laundry pile\n\n\n\nAin't got much, but we got each other\n\nNot much but love to offer\n\nI took you up\n\nI took you up\n\n\n\nGood friends, good company\n\nIn every corner of this country\n\nBut none of them quite get me\n\nThe way you get me\n\nLong drives through the countryside\n\nCheap motels, diners, and dice\n\nCallin' numbers on the billboard signs\n\nSee who picks up on the other line\n\n\n\nAin't got much, but we got each other\n\nNot much but love to offer\n\nI took you up\n\nI took you up\n\n\n\nLonely even when you're standin' there\n\nIn so deep with few words to share\n\nSometimes love gets you so damn depressed\n\nAll you can do is hide from it\n\nBut I wouldn't have it any other way\n\nWouldn't take the mansions or the getaways\n\nWouldn't trade love for a million bucks\n\nIf I have you then that's enough\n\n\n\nAin't got much, but we got each other\n\nNot much but love to offer\n\nI took you up\n\nI took you up",
