  "lyrics": "Well, I heard some people talkin' just the other day \nAnd they said you were gonna put me on a shelf \nBut let me tell you I got some news for you \nAnd you'll soon find out it's true \nAnd then you'll have to eat your lunch all by yourself \n'Cause I'm already gone \n\nAnd I'm feelin' strong \n\nI will sing this vict'ry song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo,hoo,hoo \n\n\n\nThe letter that you wrote me made me stop and wonder why \n\nBut I guess you felt like you had to set things right \n\nJust remember this, my girl, when you look up in the sky \n\nYou can see the stars and still not see the light (that's right) \n\n\n\nAnd I'm already gone \n\nAnd I'm feelin' strong \n\nI will sing this vict'ry song, woo, hoo,hoo,woo, hoo,hoo \n\n\n\nWell I know it wasn't you who held me down \n\nHeaven knows it wasn't you who set me free \n\nSo often times it happens that we live our lives in chains \n\nAnd we never even know we have the key \n\n\n\nBut me, I'm already gone \n\nAnd I'm feelin' strong \n\nI will sing this vict'ry song \n\n'Cause I'm already gone \n\nYes, I'm already gone \n\nAnd I'm feelin' strong \n\nI will sing this vict'ry song \n\n'Cause I'm already gone \n\nYes, I'm already gone \n\nAlready gone \n\nAll right, nighty-night",
