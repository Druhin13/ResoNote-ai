  "lyrics": "He's a tall drink of gin\r\nWith a world-weary grin\r\nAnd he always says just what he means\r\nEven as he draws you nearer\r\nSees himself in the mirror\r\nI think, \"How did he get in those jeans?\"\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nYou know I met him at a distance\n\nRequired no assistance\n\nTo want to make Bobby my own\n\nThen he opened up his mouth\n\nThings quickly went south\n\nNow, how do I make Bobby go home?\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd now you get to be excused\n\nOf all the childish abuse\n\nBut I still stand accused\n\nYou know it doesn't even matter now\n\n\n\nAlthough I may be shameless\n\nThis time I know I'm blameless\n\nYet somehow I'm still on the hook\n\n'Cause when a breakup's on the table\n\nThe lady's always called \"unstable\"\n\nSo don't go givin' me that look\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd now you get to be excused\n\nOf all the childish abuse\n\nBut I still stand accused\n\n\n\nI really thought that I had learned the game\n\nYou were my four-leaf clover\n\nYou make a move and then I do the same\n\nI should have taken it much, much slower\n\nIt should have ended before it was over\n\n\n\nAnd now you get to be excused\n\nOf all the childish abuse\n\nBut I still stand accused\n\nAnd now you get to be excused\n\nOf all the childish abuse\n\nBut I still stand accused\n\nYou know it doesn't even matter now",
