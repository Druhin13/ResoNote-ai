  "lyrics": "Babe, when you hear the siren sounds\r\nWhen the karma come back 'round, don’t let me down\r\nBabe, there's a time to stand your ground\r\nEven if one of them sounds, don't let me down\r\nEyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate\n\nWith a new height and the same feet on a airplane yellin’ \"Mayday\"\n\nWith a good girl, gone bad girl who ain't gay cause her date rape\n\nThat's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state\n\nState of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize\n\nRevolution will never be televised\n\nFor the enemy, they never empathize\n\nAnd I never voted, never sugar coat it\n\nWith my finger itchin' and my gun loaded\n\nWhen the fire open, let it be your moment\n\nWhen I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang!\n\nThis for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic\n\nSpeakin' honestly, we livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies\n\nMonstrosity run rampant all throughout United States\n\nTalkin' about let’s make a fort, talkin’ about let's make it great\n\nIf the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot\n\nTime to run with lions on the road to Zion\n\nIn this age of violence, time to grab the iron\n\nWhen I pop the silencer, it’s nothing but silence when-\n\n\n\nBabe, when you hear the siren sounds\n\nWhen the karma come back 'round, don't let me down\n\nBabe, there's a time to stand your ground\n\nEven if one of them sounds, don’t let me down\n\n\n\nUh, look, okay\n\nBa-aby, I'm a fool because I thought you would stay\n\nWhether I win or I lose, they already think we dead\n\nBut they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head\n\nI need to duck and not move (yeah), I bust a move when I- (uh)\n\nFind a way to get on and get up, get out the crib\n\nI was just looking into the mirror, tryna dislocate my fear\n\n'Cause you broke my heart, let me dry my tears\n\nSo serious, I'm so neglected\n\nIn the wrong direction with a long erection, got no protection\n\nBut it's, \"fuck the world\"\n\nWhen she bend it over, being over-sensitive\n\nBut did I mention that my real intentions are on me\n\nReally dealin' with the consequences\n\nAnd I see your tone is very condescending\n\nWhen I talk to you, but no you won't admit it\n\nAnd I pity the fool, been tryna to vent, but you ain't tryna hear it\n\nLike I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it\n\nJust how much you mean off to the side (oh, shit)\n\nOh say can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street\n\nBite the dust early like double Sprite, and a R.I.P. tee\n\nSo proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blow in the night time\n\nOf the slum house, little drum bump of the 1,000\n\nCome-come here they come\n\n\n\nBabe, when you hear the siren sounds\n\nWhen the karma come back 'round, don't let me down\n\nBabe, there's a time to stand your ground\n\nEven if one of them sounds, don't let me down\n\n\n\nBirds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons\n\nSoul dark as black markets, war is startin', more is sparkin'\n\nHistoric prophets praise Muhammad\n\nDiff'rent Strokes, Philip Drummond\n\nGave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'\n\nCut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'\n\nChosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London\n\nGuilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'\n\nPresident in abundance, president is a puppet\n\nGotta hate it, gotta love it, Pass a class, I rise above it\n\nWise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' \"fuck it\"\n\nDonald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?\n\nNow we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned\n\nWhat is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?\n\nNot a saint, not a sin, tell me what's my real religion?\n\nGenocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'\n\nI'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinnin', damn",
