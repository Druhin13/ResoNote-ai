  "lyrics": "Scuttling claws have cleaned her hands\r\nRising and falling\r\nIn the whirlpool sand\r\nYou, you who turn the wheel\r\nYour eyes of green and steel\r\nConsider Margaret Sands\n\n\n\nHow the gulls cry (how the gulls cry)\n\nHow the sunlight fans\n\nGliding ‘bove the bones (gliding ‘bove the bones)\n\nOf Margaret Sands\n\n\n\nNow she’s married to the swell\n\nShe’s swaying in the shells\n\nA whisper in the waves\n\nHow I listen as I sail\n\nStraight-backed and pale\n\nHer opalescent gaze\n\n\n\nHow the gulls cry (how the gulls cry)\n\nHow the sunlight fans\n\nGliding ‘bove the bones (gliding ‘bove the bones)\n\nOf Margaret Sands\n\n\n\nNow she’s married to the swell\n\nAnd she’s swaying in the shells",
