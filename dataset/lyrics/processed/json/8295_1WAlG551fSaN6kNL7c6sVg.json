  "lyrics": "You go missing like phantom limbs\r\nYou're chasing down the sunset setting in the western hills\r\nYou say you’re righting your wrongs, run and slam the car door\r\nTell me what is there to do now?\r\nSleeping light and praying for your wrists now\n\nYou’re just handwriting on the fridge now\n\nSay I won’t get sentimental but lose myself and maybe I’m wrong\n\n\n\nSun comes every night\n\nI lose myself and maybe I’m wrong\n\nWe dance like someone died\n\nThen lose ourselves and maybe you’re gone\n\n\n\nYou need to get prescriptions filled\n\nYou stay in your apartment, I call but you don’t say shit\n\nTell me that you need me, shaking and you don’t sleep\n\n\n\nTell me what I’m supposed to do now\n\nYou get high, I wait until you come down\n\nI watched you fall into yourself now\n\nAnd now I wait till you fall back out\n\nWait till you fall back out\n\n\n\nSun comes every night\n\nI lose myself and maybe I’m wrong\n\nWe dance like someone died\n\nThen lose ourselves and maybe you’re gone\n\n\n\nAnd don’t come running to the city when I fall\n\nCause I’m nothing if there’s nothing here at all\n\nCome running to the city when I fall\n\n‘Cause I’m nothing\n\n\n\nThe sun comes every night\n\nI lose myself and maybe I’m wrong\n\nWe dance like someone died\n\nThen lose ourselves and maybe you’re gone\n\nAnd don’t come running to the city when I fall\n\n'Cause I’m nothing if there’s nothing here at all\n\nAnd come running to the city when I fall\n\n‘Cause I’m nothing\n\n\n\nYou go missing like phantom limbs",
