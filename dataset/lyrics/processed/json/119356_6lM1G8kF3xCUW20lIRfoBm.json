Never mind that\n\nMovin' too fast, gotta stay on my track\n\nServin' your ho, that's a reflex\n\nI'm on the go, I cannot relax\n\nDiamonds and gold in the Rolex\n\nGrippin' on that Glock 4, playin' Russian roulette\n\nHold up, stay in your lane, nigga never pass me\n\nFuck 5-0, they will never catch me\n\nOnly time I drive slow's for the paparazzi\n\nJust to get a good pic then it's back to godspeed\n\nHopped in the Porsche, hit the bright high beams\n\nThink about when they tried to kill my dreams\n\nNow the only time they see me, I be on the big screen\n\nHit a big score now we doing big tings (Let's go, yeah)\n\n\n\nGot one leg up out the window, ayy\n\nI'm just flexin' if you didn't know, ayy\n\nI see stars when I look up, ayy (Look up, yeah)\n\nNiggas talk that talk until I pull up, ayy (Woo, woo, 'til I pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ayy (Pull up, pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ayy (Pull up, pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ayy (Pull up, pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up\n\n\n\nOoh-ooh! (Hoo, hoo, hoo, ayy)\n\nI'ma pull up in the new Zonda, all my clothes designer\n\n2018, new Prada, on the yacht like a pirate, ay\n\nBroke niggas still in that Honda, I put that on my mama\n\nTell that girl come to Bahamas, fuckin' her in her pajamas\n\nI'ma gleam on 'em like King Tut, in the Maserati going nuts\n\nWhat I'm drivin' is exotic, pull up and I'm doing donuts\n\nSee you flashin' all them bucks, you niggas gettin' no love\n\nLeg hangin' out the window, I used to take the bus\n\n\n\nGot one leg up out the window, ayy\n\nI'm just flexin' if you didn't know, ayy\n\nI see stars when I look up, ayy (Look up, yeah)\n\nNiggas talk that talk until I pull up, ayy (Woo, woo, 'til I pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ayy (Pull up, pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ayy (Pull up, pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ayy (Pull up, pull up)\n\nUntil I pull up",
