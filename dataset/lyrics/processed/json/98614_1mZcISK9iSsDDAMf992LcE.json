  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson TURN par The Wombats\r\nI jump from thought to thought like a flea jumps to a light\nYou could give an aspirin the headache of its life\nMaybe it's the crazy that I'd miss\nWatering plastic plants in the hope that they'll grow\nSeeing a message flash and then smashing up my phone\nMaybe it's the crazy that I'd miss\nIt won't get better than this\n\nI like the way your brain works, I like the way you try\nTo run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied\nI like the way you turn me inside and out\n\nI like the way you turn\n(Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)\nI like the way your brain works\n(Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)\nI like the way your brain works\n\nI want to get college girl drunk tonight\nNo morning fears, no mountains to climb\nThey say the best memories are the ones that we forget\nLike listening to Drake at your best friend's swimming pool\nFloating anti-clockwise in a red mushroom\nMaybe it's the crazy that I'd miss\nIt won't get better than this\n\n\nI like the way your brain works, I like the way you try\nTo run with the wolf pack when your legs are tied\nI like the way you turn me inside and out\nI like the way you turn\n(Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)\nI like the way your brain works\n(Woo, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)\nI like the way your brain works\n\nBaby, it's the crazy I like\nI think I saw the world turn in your eyes\nBaby, it's the crazy I like\nAnd maybe it's the bullshit I'd miss\nScreaming at the moon in black lipstick\nMaybe it's the bullshit I'd miss\n\nIt won't get better than this",
