  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Strawberries & Cigarettes par Troye Sivan\r\nRemember when we first met?\nYou said “light my cigarette”\nSo I lied to my mom and dad\nAnd jumped the fence and I ran\nBut we couldn’t go very far\n‘Cause you locked your keys in your car\nSo you sat and stared at my lips\nAnd I could already feel your kiss\n\nLong nights, daydreams\nSugar and smoke rings, I’ve been a fool\nBut strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you\nHeadlights, on me\nRacing to 60, I’ve been a fool\nBut strawberries and cigarettes always taste like\n\nBlue eyes, black jeans\nLighters and candy, I’ve been a fool\nBut strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you\n\nRemember when you taught me fate\nSaid it all be worth the wait\nLike that night in the back of the cab\nWhen your fingers walked in my hand\nNext day, nothing on my phone\nBut I can still smell you on my clothes\nAlways hoping things would change\nBut we went right back to your games\n\nLong nights, daydreams\nSugar and smoke rings, I’ve been a fool\nBut strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you\n\nHeadlights, on me\nRacing to 60, I’ve been a fool\nBut strawberries and cigarettes always taste like\nBlue eyes, black jeans\nLighters and candy, I’ve been a fool\nBut strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you\n\nAnd even if I run away\nAnd give my heart a holiday\nStill strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you\nYou always leave me wanting more\nI can’t shake my hunger for\nStrawberries and cigarettes always taste like you\nYeah, they always taste like you\nYou\nLong nights, daydreams\n\nWith that sugar and smoke rings\nAlways taste like you\n\nHeadlights, on me (And even if I run away)\nRacing to 60, I’ve been a fool (And give my heart a holiday)\nStill, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like\nBlue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more)\nLighters and candy, I’ve been a fool (I can’t shake my hunger for)\nStrawberries and cigarettes always taste like you",
