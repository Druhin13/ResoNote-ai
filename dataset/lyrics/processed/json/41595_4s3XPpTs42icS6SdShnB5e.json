  "lyrics": "Couldn't sleep last night? Me too\r\nDo you think that proves we need to stick together?\r\nOr is sympathy too serious a thing to take seriously?\r\nBut if deep and dark you say you need then let me disagree\r\nThere's nothing else so deep as time in joy so spend some time on me\n\n\n\nSo you stayed up late? Me too\n\nI couldn't recommend a different course of action\n\nIf I came on shy, too wired, now I feel so tired\n\nBut if deep and dark you say you need then let me disagree\n\nThere's nothing else so deep as time in joy so spend some time on me\n\n\n\nSo you read the books, learned the tunes\n\nOf course that's bound to help you pay the rent\n\nMaking meaning is just too dull to take seriously, so I won't\n\nBut if deep and dark you say you need then let me disagree\n\nThere's nothing else so deep as time in joy so spend some time on me\n\n\n\nWho's gonna ask you the question?\n\nIf only to relieve this hold\n\nDid you ever get the shivers when you said hello?",
