  "lyrics": "When you're all alone for days, asleep for days\r\nAnd you can't see out your windows for the haze\r\nAnd it seems so dark out but you can't find your way\r\nJust slow down\r\nWhen the weight of expectations sinks you down\n\nWhen it seems like there's nobody else around\n\nAnd you look again but your friends can't be found\n\nJust hold on to yourself\n\nHold on to yourself\n\n\n\nWhen things are seeming out of your control\n\nAnd your body seems to be [?] in your soul\n\nAnd your [?] party's such a drag\n\nAll those grown-ups seem so sad\n\nBut things ain't like they were when we were kids\n\nWith your father's anger, in the closet's where you hid\n\nBut he's not there and it's nothin' that you did\n\n\n\nSo just slow down, we're right here\n\nSlow down, we're right here\n\nHold on to yourself\n\nCalm down, you're right here\n\nSlow down\n\nSlow down, we're right here\n\nWe're right here, we're right here\n\nSlow, slow down",
