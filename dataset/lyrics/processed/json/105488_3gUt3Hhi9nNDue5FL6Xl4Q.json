  "lyrics": "I've stretched myself too thin\r\nTried to be everything\r\nDon't know how to love\r\nI can't wait too much\r\nI need a thicker skin\r\nTo let nobody in\n\nDon't know how to guard\n\nMy tears and my loss\n\n\n\nDark nights the silence ease me up, but\n\nDay comes and everything's enough\n\n\n\nI'm free but I'm fragile\n\nI'm happy but I'm worried\n\nI'm set up but I'm so afraid\n\nI get pins and needles\n\nWhen I think about it\n\nIt catches me everyday\n\nI've got scars on my soul\n\nThat I'm scared to show\n\nI cried every morning\n\nBut you'd never know\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities\n\n\n\nI'd tried to raise my voice\n\nAir crowded by the noise\n\nTripped up more than twice\n\nThose fools taught me right\n\nI'd bared my naked soul\n\nAll on my painful flaws\n\nWish I could open up\n\nTake in the love\n\n\n\nDark nights the silence ease me up, but\n\nDay comes and everything's enough (Oh)\n\n\n\nI'm free but I'm fragile\n\nI'm happy but I'm worried\n\nI'm set up but I'm so afraid\n\nI get pins and needles\n\nWhen I think about it\n\nIt catches me everyday\n\nI've got scars on my soul\n\nThat I'm scared to show\n\nI cried every morning\n\nBut you'd never know\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities\n\n\n\nEvery freckle on my skin has a reason\n\nEvery scar that I have was worth bleeding\n\nEvery curl on my head is a treasure\n\nI think about it, I don't wanna lie, can't find it\n\n\n\nI'm free but I'm fragile\n\nI'm happy but I'm worried\n\nI'm set up but I'm so afraid\n\nI get pins and needles\n\nWhen I think about it\n\nIt catches me everyday\n\nI've got scars on my soul\n\nThat I'm scared to show\n\nI cried every morning\n\nBut you'd never know\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities\n\n\n\nI should let it be\n\nIt's just my insecurities",
