  "lyrics": "Standing in the doorway, the money's running low\r\nSpent it all the week before in the Gulf of Mexico\r\nBut I got a lead on Monday, that something's coming soon\r\nIt's gonna get us back to the golden days, and the carefree afternoons\r\nSo get your things together, we're getting out of here tonight\n\nOn a desert road that pulls us west, underneath the blue moonlight\n\nOh, this time will be different, this time we'll make it last\n\nNo more worry 'bout the future, no more running from the past\n\n\n\nAre you ready to go again?\n\nWe'll push on to the end\n\nWatch the fire burn, see how far we go\n\n\n\nNo more worry 'bout the future, no more running from the past\n\nNo more worry 'bout the future, no more running from the past\n\n\n\n\n\nNo more worry 'bout the future, no more running from the past",
