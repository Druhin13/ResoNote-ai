  "lyrics": "When I was just a boy\r\nMy momma told me, “Son\r\nYou look so serious” (Smile and have some fun)\r\nWhen I was seventeen\r\nMy father let me know\r\n“Life isn’t fun and games” (Gotta sell your soul)\n\n\n\nI don’t know how I ended up\n\nSo close to where I started\n\nI went to war for peace of mind\n\nBut what’s it for?\n\n\n\nI’m dancing on a tightrope\n\nNo time to mess around\n\nJust trying to let my mind go\n\nI’m never coming down\n\n\n\nI found a preacher man\n\nTo help me understand\n\nWhat we are doing here (What comes after life)\n\nAnd now the years have passed\n\nBeen to the moon and back\n\nAnd all I’ve realized (No one knows but me)\n\n\n\nI don’t know how I ended up\n\nSo close to where I started\n\nI went to war for peace of mind\n\nBut what’s it for?\n\n\n\nI’m dancing on a tightrope\n\nNo time to mess around\n\nJust trying to let my mind go\n\nI’m never coming down\n\nI’m never coming down\n\nI’m never coming down\n\n\n\nTeachers always say stay in between the lines\n\nPromise you’ll be quiet if you can’t say something nice\n\nDoctors always say take these pills for your health\n\nBut now I can’t remember how to think for myself\n\n\n\nI’m dancing on a tightrope\n\nNo time to mess around\n\nJust trying to let my mind go\n\nI’m never coming down",
