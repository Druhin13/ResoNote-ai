  "lyrics": "Guess it's kind of funny, looking back at those times\r\nGetting in playground fights, holding me back\r\nSaved my life like once or twice\r\nWe moved to the city, I was staying out most nights\r\nHanging with the wrong guys\r\nYou pulled me back\n\nSaved my life like once or twice\n\n\n\nDidn’t wanna be young, Didn't wanna be young\n\nYeah we were in such a rush, but what a rush\n\nI know we grew apart, we grew up, though I loved you so much\n\nI never said it enough, could never say enough\n\n\n\nWe were just kids\n\nWe had each other, you're still with me\n\n’Cause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\nLifted me up, onto your shoulders when I couldn't see\n\n'Cause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\n\n\nWe were just kids, we were just kids\n\nYeah we were just kids, we were just kids\n\n\n\nIn the street playing ball, yeah\n\nSo how'd you even get so tall, yeah\n\nThe summers got to turn into fall, yeah\n\nI swear it's like we've been through it all, yeah\n\nHear our mum and dad fighting\n\nHiding in my room like we're tryna dodge lighting\n\nRiding in my car, let's forget and get ice cream\n\nDon’t you ever wonder where those nights went?\n\n\n\nDidn’t wanna be young, Didn't wanna be young\n\nYeah we were in such a rush, but what a rush\n\nI know we grew apart, we grew up, though I loved you so much\n\nI never said it enough, could never say enough\n\n\n\nWe were just kids\n\nWe had each other, you’re still with me\n\n'Cause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\nLifted me up, onto your shoulders when I couldn't see\n\n'Cause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\n\n\nWe were just kids, we were just kids\n\nYeah we were just kids, we were just kids\n\n\n\nDidn’t wanna be young, Didn't wanna be young\n\nYeah we were in such a rush, but what a rush\n\nI know we grew apart, we grew up, though I loved you so much\n\nI never said it enough, could never say enough\n\n\n\nWe were just kids\n\nWe had each other, you're still with me\n\nCause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\nLifted me up, onto your shoulders when I couldn't see\n\nCause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\nWe were just kids\n\nWe had each other, you're still with me\n\nCause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\nLifted me up, onto your shoulders when I couldn't see\n\nCause you had my back, I had your back\n\nYou carry me\n\nWe were just kids, we were just kids",
