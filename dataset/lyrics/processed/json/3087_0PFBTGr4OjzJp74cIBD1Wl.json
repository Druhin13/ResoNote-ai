  "lyrics": "You can't cut me loose until you show me\r\nI told you the truth about the old me\r\nAnd now you use confession as the proof\r\nDo what you have to do\r\nGo ahead and act the fool\n\nWhat if in the end\n\nYou want so bad to forgive\n\nBut you cannot forget\n\n\n\nSo (so tied up)\n\nWe've been here before\n\nI'm so (so tied up)\n\nYou want something more\n\nLover, best friend, my worst enemy\n\nYou know I won't let you get away\n\n\n\nI get you to swerve out of the fast lane\n\nYou still got champagne running through your veins\n\nYou dare me to step up and challenge you?\n\nNeither one of us can stand to lose\n\nStand to lose\n\n\n\nRemember we said, it'd be like after the rain\n\nWashes away our sins\n\nThey never said that love is a twisted game\n\nAnd no one ever wins\n\n\n\nSo (so tied up)\n\nWe've been here before\n\nSo (so tied up)\n\nYou want something more\n\nLover, best friend, my worst enemy\n\nYou know I won't let you get away\n\n\n\nSo, so, so tied up\n\nSo, so, so, so tied up\n\nSo, so, so tied up\n\nSo, so, so, so tied up\n\n\n\nYou threw me a rope\n\nOpposites attract\n\nI'm self absorbed and you're superficial\n\nWe wound each other up\n\nBeing true to yourself could never be enough\n\n\n\n(So, so, so tied up) I tried to let go\n\n(So, so, so, so tied up) We've been here before\n\nLover, best friend, my worst enemy\n\nYou know I won't let you get away\n\n\n\nSo tied up\n\nSo tied up\n\nSo tied up\n\nSo tied up",
