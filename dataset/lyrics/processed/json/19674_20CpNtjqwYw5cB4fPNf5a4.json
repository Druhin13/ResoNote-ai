  "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\r\nYoung aggressor, born into the life of crime\r\nI would walk down the streets strapped with two nines\r\nBitch smacking, jacking niggas, G dub stacking figures\r\nPolice drive by, I was click clacking triggers\r\nJay De Lucas put me with the fam to grow\n\nI was a boss amongst white boys rocking the flow\n\nI had hoes, bankrolls and minks by the dozen\n\nMy rise to power was quick, they just wasn't\n\nTrying to make me a made man, they fucked up the game plan\n\nI blacked out on them and started my own clan\n\nBlack Gambino, black suits, black Syndicate\n\nMy crime fam was tight, every move was intricate\n\nThe coke was brought in from by bad Columbian mules\n\nGorgeous women that I draped down in jewels\n\nStreets fight started, mafia wars in Italy\n\nCrime fam against fam and no one could do diddely\n\n\n\n(Hook)\n\nDo the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads\n\nGo against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes\n\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\n\nChase the paper cause it's the cash that rules\n\n\n\n(Verse 2)\n\nFuck the law of the fam, it's the law of land\n\nYou don't like how I move then try to force my hand\n\nI'm moving keys, them De Lucas couldn't touch my pianos\n\nPutting pressure on them Gambinis and Barizzanos\n\nThey love my money, they hate to see a nigga getting it\n\nSelling drugs is taboo, but I ain't fucking sweating it\n\nThe dirt gotta get done so I took my position\n\nOne day I'm just blood to it with a lot of ambition\n\nNext I got status, dinners with all courses\n\nFlights in and out of the country, they getting nauseous\n\nMoney, power, respect, rise of the black suits\n\nTalk shit behind my back, but to my face salute\n\nHugs and handshakes, they can't stop my reign\n\nGot the coconut, pilots bringing shit on their plane\n\nIt's a shame, they ain't have the balls to make moves\n\nThey pussies, couldn't walk a mile in my shoes\n\n\n\n(Hook x2)\n\nDo the dirty work, bring in the coke by the boatloads\n\nGo against the grain, nigga, I feed nose holes\n\nFollow no family rules, rules are for fools\n\nChase the paper cause it's the cash that rules",
