  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Drugs & Candy par All Time Low\r\nI can't take another hollow point conversation\nIt's getting harder to fake\nThe sound of you, an outlasting vibration\nThere's something I can't shake\n\nThe sweetness of you on my tongue\nI breathed you in, you filled my lungs\nA bitter taste, surrender waste\nAnother weakness\n\nYou and me are like drugs and candy\nTake one down for the young and easy\nYou've got me out of my head\nI fill this space in your bed\nI got the beat of the breakdown, breakdown\nYou and me are like drugs and candy\n\nAnd I don't wanna give it up\n\nYou caught me in a moment of redemption\nThere's nothing to explain\nYou had me on the edge of indiscretion\nYou said you feel the same\n\nThe sweetness of you on my tongue\nI breathed you in, you filled my lungs\nA bitter taste, surrender waste\nAnother weakness\n\nYou and me are like drugs and candy\nTake one down for the young and easy\nYou've got me out of my head\nI fill this space in your bed\nI got the beat of the breakdown, breakdown\nYou and me are like drugs and candy\n\nAnd I don't wanna give it up\n\nDrugs and candy\nDrugs and candy\n\nThe sweetness of you on my tongue\nI breathe you in, you fill my lungs\nA bitter taste surrender waste\nAnother weakness\n\nYou and me are like drugs and candy\nTake one down for the young and easy\nYou've got me out of my head\nI fill this space in your bed\nI got the beat of the breakdown, breakdown\nYou and me are like drugs and candy\nAnd I don't wanna give it up\n\n\nDrugs and candy\nNo I don't wanna give it up\nDrugs and candy\nYou've got me out of my head\nI got the beat of the breakdown\nAnd I don't wanna give it up\nDrugs and candy",
