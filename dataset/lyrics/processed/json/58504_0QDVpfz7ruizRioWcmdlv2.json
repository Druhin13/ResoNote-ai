  "lyrics": "We will not lose heart\r\nEven though this present age will waste away\r\nWe will surely suffer, but it's a slight momentary trouble\r\nThe deconstruction is painful, but the transformation is beautiful\r\nWhen we the children of God are crushed under the heavy affliction of this world, be reminded that it's weightless in comparison to the eternal measure of God's glory\r\nWe have lost our eyes for the unseen and have swallowed the false hope of the visible\n\nWe must realize the empty grave and revel in the certainty of His resurrection with assurance of renewal considering it worthy to suffer for the faith\n\nSo we will worship while we wait",
