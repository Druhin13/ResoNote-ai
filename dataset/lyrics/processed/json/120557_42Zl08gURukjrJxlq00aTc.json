  "lyrics": "But now it's time to take off\r\nBut now it’s time to take off\r\nHeartBeatz on the track\r\nI waited long enough, but now it's time to take off\r\nI was working all night and I ain't have no days off\n\nMake myself a boss, ’cause I just like to make calls\n\nBitch it's game seven and we ballin' like the playoffs\n\nOne call and that's all, can erase y'all\n\nWanted me to fall off, well guess what? You can stay lost\n\nIf you wanna tell the truth, bitch, I made y'all\n\nBut whatever you goin' through, don't let it make or break y’all\n\n\n\nWork hard, no sleep\n\nHad some long nights when I ain’t eat\n\nI'm everything that they had wanted to be\n\nBe careful, lil’ shawty was pointin' at me\n\nWe all know the truth, they weren't humble like me\n\nBitch niggas talkin' ’bout stompin' on me\n\nYou got me fucked up, you know I was gon' squeeze\n\nBeen riding all week with my gun on the seat\n\nI received his death wish, but it's okay, y'all\n\n'Cause when we catch him late night we gon' knock his face off\n\nBitch all you do is talk, and all we do is stalk\n\nI feel like fuck 'em all, ain't never hate on y'all\n\n\n\nI waited long enough, but now it's time to take off\n\nI was working all night and I ain't have no days off\n\nMake myself a boss, 'cause I just like to make calls\n\nBitch it's game seven and we ballin' like the playoffs\n\nOne call and that's all, can erase y'all\n\nWanted me to fall off, well guess what? You can stay lost\n\nIf you wanna tell the truth, bitch, I made y'all\n\nBut whatever you goin' through, don't let it make or break y'all\n\n\n\nI made y'all\n\nTo tell the truth, I made y'all\n\nTo tell the truth, I made, I made y'all\n\nLil' boys, I made y'all\n\nTo tell the truth, I made y'all\n\nMight snatch your shit, I made y'all",
