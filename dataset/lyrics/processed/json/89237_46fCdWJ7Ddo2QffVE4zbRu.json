  "lyrics": "Walking down Parsons green, I can feel the cold\r\nThe leaves in the park are turning brown, I'm twenty two years old\r\nCrazy that I was stood right here just five years ago\r\nWith the heat on my skin and a lover who is now someone I don't know\r\nYou don't see it, when it's happening, happens overtime\n\nFirst you're loving, then you're crying\n\nThen you can't decide\n\n\n\nMy life's uncertain and sometimes strange\n\nBut one thing I've learned is it won't stay the same\n\nEven in the darkness I'll be okay\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\n\n\nWinter comes racing 'round, something 'bout the air\n\nThe fire's on and the chimney smoke is tangled in my hair\n\nCrazy how much my life has changed in just in a year\n\nThere's people I've met, people I've left, and some that didn't make it here\n\n\n\nYou don't see it, when it's happening, happens overtime\n\nFirst you're loving, then you're crying\n\nThen you can't decide\n\n\n\nMy life's uncertain and sometimes strange\n\nBut one thing I've learned is it won't stay the same\n\nEven in the darkness I'll be okay\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\n\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change\n\nThe sun will come up, the seasons will change",
