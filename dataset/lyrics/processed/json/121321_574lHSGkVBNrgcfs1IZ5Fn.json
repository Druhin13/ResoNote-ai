  "lyrics": "Life is a struggle\r\nWe're being prepared to delve in the greater parts of us\r\nIt's the one fight in our lives that we have to win\r\nNo choice but to win, to believe that we can win\r\nLife can be so hard to take, sometimes it seems the only safe\n\nWay to get through the day, wait till it goes away\n\nGrief can be so hard to fake, a lying smile, beautiful face\n\nSoul telling you to wait, know this is not your fate\n\nThese broken hearts and broken dreams and broken lives with broken spines\n\nBroken hearts and borrowed time like broken records, we keep trying\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to see that broken child inside of me\n\nTell him it's gonna be alright, the world is worth the fight\n\n\n\nThe light will find us even if it blinds us\n\nOur time defines us, nothing can divide us\n\nIf we sing, if we sing\n\nIf we sing, if we sing\n\nIf we sing, if we sing\n\nIf we sing\n\n\n\nGive me something to believe in\n\nDo you suffer just the same?\n\nJust give me something to believe in\n\nAs the world walks away\n\nIs it too much to take?\n\nIs it too much to say?\n\nSo as long as I am breathing\n\nI need something to believe in\n\n\n\nIt's the one fight in our lives that we have to win\n\n\n\nI see so many pieces of you broken, this is not the end\n\nJust follow in these footsteps, maybe I could even hold you down\n\nI'd take you in a single breath, I'd never ever breathe again\n\nWe make another heaven where every single heart can mend\n\nListen up, hear me out, I'm the one who's searching now\n\nHold your hope, don't hold it down, you once were lost, but now you're found\n\nWhat I wouldn't give to see, the grace inside of you and me\n\nI know it's gonna be alright, the world is worth the fight\n\n\n\nThe light will find us even if it blinds us\n\nOur time defines us, nothing can divide us\n\nIf we sing, if we sing\n\nIf we sing, if we sing\n\nIf we sing, if we sing\n\nIf we sing\n\n\n\nGive me something to believe in\n\nDo you suffer just the same?\n\nJust give me something to believe in\n\nAs the world walks away\n\nIs it too much to take?\n\nIs it too much to say?\n\nSo as long as I am breathing\n\nI need something to believe in\n\n\n\nBelief is all that we have, but belief is all that we need\n\nI remember, when I was a kid, fearless against the wind, brought down by the storm within\n\nBut from the bottom of a sea, I sang again, and again, and again, and again\n\nBelief is all that we have, but belief is all that we need",
