  "lyrics": "Who took the bone to the beast?\nWho led it back to grace and gave it fire for its feast?\nWho took the bone to the beast?\nNow it lies breathing peacefully while hope lies underneath\n\nWhy breed a boy for his meat\n\nTo teach the child cruel rituals or ruin to repeat?\n\nWhy leave a heart in the heat\n\nTill the marble bath that held the truth lies broken at your feet?\n\n\n\nBring me a man who is sweet\n\nA quiet son of whom intends to never taste defeat\n\nFor Iâ€™ve seen a soul drag its feet\n\nAnd come to rest inside a life with nothing left to eat",
