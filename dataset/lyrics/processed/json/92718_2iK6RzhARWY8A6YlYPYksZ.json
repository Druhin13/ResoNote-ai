You know\n\n\n\nOh, if I could stop the hands of that clock\n\nNever let 'em tick, tick, tick\n\nWherever I go, yeah, I would still know\n\nThat even though it's selfish, oh\n\n\n\nI don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else\n\nI can't compare you to no one else, no one else\n\n'Cause people change and memories fade\n\nBut could you stay the same, if nothing else?\n\nNo, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else\n\n\n\nNobody, nobody, nobody else\n\nNobody else\n\nNobody, nobody, nobody else\n\nOoh\n\n'Cause people change and memories fade\n\nBut could you stay the same, if nothing else? (Nobody, nobody, nobody)\n\nI said people change and memories fade\n\nBut could you stay the same, if nothing else?\n\n\n\nI don't wanna share you with no one else, no one else (Nobody else)\n\nI can't compare you to no one else, no one else (Can't compare you)\n\n'Cause people change and memories fade\n\nBut could you stay the same, if nothing else? (Nobody else)\n\nNo, I don't wanna share you with no one else, nobody else",
