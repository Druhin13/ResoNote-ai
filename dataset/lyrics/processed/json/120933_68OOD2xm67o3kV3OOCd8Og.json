  "lyrics": "They say I'm a non-believer\r\nAll I know is what I’ve seen\r\nI've seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray\r\nWe might be bruised but we’re not broken, no surrender, minds awoken\r\n'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way\r\nAnd I say...\n\n\n\nHey, make it our way\n\nMake it our way, 'til the river runs dry\n\nWe 'gon make it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\n\n\nI'm just trying to find the silver in the lining, just trying to keep on surviving\n\nAnd trying to keep my composure as everything is declining\n\nLines drawn in the sand and everybody is divided\n\nBut living under pressure is bound to produce a diamond\n\nWe been rising with the heat so, we grow\n\nFlipping on that beast mode\n\nMind over matter is the metaphoric cheat code\n\nAnd everywhere that we go, we walk around as equals\n\nAmigos, who recognise we all one people\n\n'Cause we 'gon make our way through it eventually, mentally\n\nChange fundamentally, swap ego out for empathy\n\nThird eye blind, open sesame\n\nPresently, fulfilling destiny and becoming who I was meant to be\n\n\n\nThey say I'm a non-believer\n\nAll I know is what I’ve seen\n\nI’ve seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray\n\nWe might be bruised but we’re not broken, no surrender, minds awoken\n\n'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way\n\nAnd I say...\n\n\n\nHey, make it our way\n\nMake it our way, 'til the river runs dry\n\nWe 'gon make it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nAnd I say...\n\nHey, make it our way\n\nMake it our way, ’til the river runs dry\n\nWe 'gon make it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\n\n\nEver since somebody drew the lines that divided us into nations\n\nDesigned to give rights to the trials and tribulations\n\nDifference in pigmentation, religious affiliation\n\nPolitical party biases really were all the same beneath the surface\n\nAnd nobody is perfect, regardless of who you love\n\nOr regardless of who you worship\n\nWe all got survivor in us, we all got that fire in us\n\nWe all got one shot at life, and I'm willing to die to live it\n\nSo bring in the violinist, and bring in the quoir too\n\nWe all gotta' find within us the thing that inspires you\n\nThe thing that'll wake you up, the thing that's inside you\n\nNow think of that thing, and use it to drive you\n\nGotta' use it to pick you up, whenever you feeling low\n\nJust bottle that feeling up, and do not let that feeling go\n\nAnd always know that, as we travel down this long dark hallway\n\nAll I know is that we gonna' make it our way\n\n\n\nThey say I'm a non-believer\n\nAll I know is what I've seen\n\nI've seen some things that'll make a man get down and pray\n\nWe might be bruised but we're not broken, no surrender, minds awoken\n\n'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way\n\n'Cause when everything goes wrong, we find a way\n\nAnd I say...\n\n\n\nHey, make it our way\n\nMake it our way, 'til the river runs dry\n\nWe 'gon make it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nAnd I say...\n\nHey, make it our way\n\nMake it our way, 'til the river runs dry\n\nWe 'gon make it our way\n\nMake it our way\n\nMake it our way",
