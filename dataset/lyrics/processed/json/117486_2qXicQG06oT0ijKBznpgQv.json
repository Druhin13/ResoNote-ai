  "lyrics": "You and I used to walk the streets at night\r\nOur parents didn't know\r\nKept the TV going\r\nLeft on all the bedroom lights\r\nAnd no I haven't seen you since\r\nWe lost all our innocence\n\nYou left me in the dark\n\nWhile you drink in the park\n\nNever be the same again\n\n\n\nYou and me were so, so close\n\nMaybe that's what hurts the most\n\nIt's out of my hands\n\nI've done what I can\n\nSo I just save my breath\n\n\n\nDeep in my heart I\n\nKnow that it's over\n\nDeleted your number\n\nSo I can't call you\n\nCall you my brother\n\nThe why we used to\n\nWhen we were younger, younger\n\n\n\nI saw you just the other night\n\nI didn't even recognize you\n\nFind it kind of strange\n\nGuess that people change\n\nBut I didn't expect you to\n\n\n\nYou and me were so, so close\n\nAnd maybe that's what hurts the most\n\nIt's out my hands\n\nDone what I can\n\nSo I just save my breath\n\n\n\nDeep in my heart I\n\nKnow that it's over\n\nDeleted your number\n\nSo I can't call you\n\nCall you my brother\n\nThe why we used to\n\nWhen we were younger, younger\n\n\n\nTryna get in touch with you\n\nI don't know where you've been\n\nHave a conversation\n\nBut you'll never let me in\n\nI've tried, I've tried\n\nI've tried with you a thousand times\n\n\n\nMaybe I don't have to play the bad guy in the end\n\n'Cause I've been trying hard enough to be a better friend\n\nI've tried, I've tried\n\nBut we're out of time\n\n\n\nDeep in my heart I\n\nKnow that it's over\n\nDeleted your number\n\nSo I can't call you\n\nMy brother\n\nThe why we used to\n\nWhen we were younger, younger",
