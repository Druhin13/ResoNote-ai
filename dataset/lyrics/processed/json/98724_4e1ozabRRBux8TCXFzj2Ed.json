  "lyrics": "I'm passive to the point of giving up\r\nDon’t have a shirt left clean enough to stumble out\r\nSo I’m drifting by the woman in the clouds\r\nOf the celebrity cologne\r\nBut it won't work like that\n\nCause nothing works like that\n\nNothing works like that\n\nNothing works like\n\n\n\nNow I've been trapped here in the mall for too long\n\nBetween an exit and a pregnant ex love\n\nShe's saying she believes in god again\n\nAnd it feels nice to think\n\nThat someone's watching from above\n\n\n\nBut it won't work like that\n\nCause nothing works like that\n\nNothing works like\n\n\n\nNothing works like that",
