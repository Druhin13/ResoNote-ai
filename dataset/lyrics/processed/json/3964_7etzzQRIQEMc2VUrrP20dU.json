  "lyrics": "She said revenge can be so sweet\r\nI like to take it when I can\r\nI need to play with the ones I hate\r\nI like to see them suffer\r\nIt has to be dangerous\n\nIt has to be refined\n\nIt has to be skillfull\n\nYou need to take your time\n\n\n\nShe said I take care\n\nOf my resources\n\nYou never know\n\nWhen you might need them\n\n\n\nI'm fast and I'm strong\n\nMy reflexes are good\n\nIt doesn't take long\n\nTo achieve my deserved revenge",
