  "lyrics": "Sweetly, pleasantly fleeting\r\nNight is to day as death is to dreaming\r\nOne thing I'll miss once I am leaving\r\nIs you by my side every evening\r\nNothing's forever\n\nLove's light as a feather\n\nOr so it's been said\n\nSeeing is believing\n\nThe heart is deceiving\n\nOr so I have read\n\nThere isn't a minute that passes\n\nNowhere I'd rather be instead\n\nThan watching you sleep while I sit\n\nAt the foot of your bed\n\n\n\nDarling, life of the party\n\nDarkness has fallen\n\nThe good times are calling\n\nPlay me for keeps\n\nI think you got it:\n\nA trick up your sleeve\n\nThen me in your pocket\n\n\n\nNothing's forever\n\nLove's light as a feather\n\nOr so it's been said\n\nSeeing is believing\n\nThe heart is deceiving\n\nOr so I have read\n\nThere isn't a minute that passes\n\nNowhere I'd rather be instead\n\nThan watching you sleep while I sit\n\nAt the foot of your bed\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh\n\n\n\nNothing's forever\n\nLove's light as a feather\n\nOr so it's been said\n\nSeeing is believing\n\nThe heart is deceiving\n\nOr so I have read\n\nThere isn't a minute that passes\n\nNowhere I'd rather be instead\n\nThan watching you sleep while I sit\n\nAt the foot of your bed",
