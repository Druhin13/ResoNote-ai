  "lyrics": "Time, yeah I keep wasting all my time\r\nYeah I keep trying to unwind-wind-wind\r\nWhy am I falling so behind?\r\nI don't know what to say\r\nAnd I don't know what to do\r\nWhen you're falling out of love\n\nWhen there's nothing else to lose\n\nExcept for time\n\nYeah I keep wasting all my time\n\n\n\nI'm not okay, I'm not okay, I'm not okay\n\nBut I keep slipping\n\nI'm not okay, I'm not okay, I'm not okay\n\nBut I keep slipping\n\nBut I keep slipping down\n\n\n\nYeah, we finally found a place to dwell\n\nCould this be heaven? Feels like hell\n\nCan I move on? It's hard to tell\n\nWill someone tell me?\n\nYou wanna sail away\n\nOut of darkness out of pain\n\nDo you wanna really know how to\n\nHow to listen to your soul?\n\nIt just takes time\n\nYeah I keep wasting all my time\n\n\n\nI'm not okay, I'm not okay, I'm not okay\n\nBut I keep slipping\n\nI'm not okay, I'm not okay, I'm not okay\n\nBut I keep slipping\n\nBut I keep slipping down\n\nYeah I'm slipping down, away\n\nKnow I wanna talk to you\n\nRoll around and walk with you\n\n\n\nStop hitting my heart\n\nI won't quit I won't stop\n\nClimbing over the top of you\n\nStop hitting my heart\n\nI won't quit I won't stop\n\nClimbing over the top\n\nI'm climbing over the top of you\n\n\n\nI won't quit I won't stop\n\nClimbing over the top of you\n\nI won't quit I won't stop\n\nClimbing over the top of you\n\nI'm not okay, I'm not okay\n\nBut I keep slipping down",
