  "lyrics": "I Met him when I was young\r\nI Was out with my best friend having fun\r\nShe died when she was 21\r\nSometimes I still think about her\r\nWhen I pass him on the street or when I meet him in a bar\n\nWhen I feel him in my dreams or when I wake up in the dark\n\nIt’s like we’re strangers\n\nWe're strangers\n\nBut he knows everything about me\n\n\n\nWe moved in with eachother pretty fast\n\nSometimes we fought real bad\n\nBut he made me laugh almost every day\n\nOh, it was hard to see him walk away\n\n\n\nWhen I pass him on the street or when I meet him in a bar\n\nWhen I feel him in my dreams or when I wake up in the dark\n\nIt’s like we’re strangers\n\nWe’re strangers\n\nBut he knows everything about me\n\n\n\nPlease don’t tell my secrets to anyone\n\nI will never tell your secrets to anyone\n\nOh, please don’t tell my secrets to anyone\n\nI will never tell your secrets to anyone\n\n\n\nStrangers\n\nStrangers\n\nHe knows everything about me\n\nOh, I know everything about him",
