  "lyrics": "What ever happened to staying together\r\nWhen you said \"I do\" it meant \"I do\", forever\r\nWe got daddies leaving and strung out mothers\r\nAnd we got brothers killing brothers\r\nWhat ever happened to the good old days\r\nWe're running out of the good old days\r\nMoving in reverse, something's got to change\r\nWhat ever happened to the good old days\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nLosing sight of what it means to love\r\nWe lost our minds and started back at one\r\nChoosing sides is just a losing game\r\nWe're colorblind, we all bleed the same\r\nWhat ever happened to the good old days\r\nWe're running out of the good old days\r\nMoving in reverse, something's got to change\r\nWhat ever happened to the good old days\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nMoving in reverse, moving in reverse\r\nMoving in reverse, moving in reverse\r\nMoving in reverse, gotta keep a forward motion\r\nMoving in reverse, gotta keep a forward motion\r\nWhat ever happened to the good old days\r\nWe're running out of the good old days\r\nMoving in reverse, something's got to change\r\nWhat ever happened to the good old days\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened\r\nWhat ever happened, what ever happened",
