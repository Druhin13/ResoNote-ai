  "lyrics": "Something ‘bout the rules you attract\r\nDon’t tell me that you made it up\r\nWe can always screw with the facts\r\nDon’t tell me that I’ve seen enough\r\nCause if I saw nothing why would I look twice?\n\nAin't about the dress that you own\n\nIts just something came undone\n\nEverything you hide between the lines\n\nIs just another give-away\n\n\n\nYou’re always the last one to know\n\nWe’re finally close when you first walk away\n\nThere’s something about how you go\n\nThat makes me feel everything you wanna say\n\nWhether we’re fucking around\n\nOr just feeling it out\n\n\n\nWith every role that you play\n\nThe revolution televised\n\nThere’s a time and a place\n\nDon’t tell me that its paradise\n\nEverything you hide between the lines\n\nIs just another give-away\n\n\n\nWe can always leave this town\n\nOr stay to watch it all fall down\n\nBut between you and I\n\nIts just a moment along the way\n\n\n\nYou’re always the last one to know\n\nWe’re finally close when you first walk away\n\nThere’s something about how you go\n\nThat makes me feel everything you wanna say\n\nYou’re always the last one to know\n\nWe’re finally close when you first walk away\n\nThere’s something about how you go\n\nThat makes me feel everything you wanna say\n\nWhether we’re fucking around\n\nOr just feeling it out\n\nIts just a moment, its just a moment, its just a moment away\n\n\n\nWe can always screw with the facts\n\nTell them that we made it up\n\nWhen all the words were taken back\n\nIt doesn’t mean you’ve given up\n\nCause if I saw nothing why would I look twice?\n\nBut between you and I\n\nIts just a moment along the way\n\n\n\nYou’re always the last one to know\n\nWe’re finally close when you first walk away\n\nThere’s something about how you go\n\nThat makes me feel everything you wanna say\n\nWhether we’re fucking around\n\nOr just feeling it out\n\nIts just a moment, yeah, its just a moment away",
