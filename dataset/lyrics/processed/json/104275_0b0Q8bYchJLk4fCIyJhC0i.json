  "lyrics": "When you're weary, you're feeling small\r\nWhen tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all\r\nI'm on your side when times get rough\r\nAnd friends just can't be found\r\nLike a bridge over troubled water\r\nI will lay me down\n\n\n\nWhen you're down and out\n\nWhen you're on the street\n\nWhen evening falls so hard\n\nI will comfort you\n\nI'll take your part when darkness comes\n\nAnd pain is all around\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\n\nI will lay me down\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\n\nI will lay me down\n\n\n\nOh, I will lay me down\n\nLike a bridge over troubled\n\n\n\nSail on silver girl\n\nSail on by\n\nYour time has come to shine\n\nAnd all your dreams are on their way\n\nSee how they shine\n\nAnd if you need a friend\n\nI'm sailing right behind\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\n\nI will ease your mind\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\n\nI will ease your mind\n\n\n\nLike a bridge over troubled water\n\nI will ease your mind",
