  "lyrics": "Santa Baby, slip a sable under the tree, For me.\r\nbeen an awful good girl, Santa baby,\r\nso hurry down the chimney tonight.\r\nSanta baby, a 54 convertible too,\r\nLight blue.\n\nI'll wait up for you dear,\n\nSanta baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.\n\n\n\nThink of all the fun I've missed,\n\nThink of all the fellas that I haven't kissed,\n\nNext year I could be just as good,\n\nIf you'll check off my Christmas list,\n\n\n\nSanta baby, I wanna yacht,\n\nAnd really that's not a lot,\n\nBeen an angel all year,\n\nSanta baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.\n\n\n\nSanta honey, there's one thing I really do need,\n\nThe deed\n\nTo a platinum mine,\n\nSanta honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight.\n\n\n\nSanta cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex,\n\nAnd checks.\n\nSign your 'X' on the line,\n\nSanta cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight.\n\n\n\nCome and trim my Christmas tree,\n\nWith some decorations bought at Tiffany's,\n\nI really do believe in you,\n\nLet's see if you believe in me,\n\n\n\nSanta baby, forgot to mention one little thing,\n\nA ring.\n\nI don't mean on the phone,\n\nSanta baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight,\n\nHurry down the chimney tonight,\n\nHurry, tonight.",
