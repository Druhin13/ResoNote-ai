  "lyrics": "You're watching your favorite show\r\nWhen the TV died\r\nThe biggest power-cut in your neighbourhood since 1989\r\nA blackout in the center of town\r\nBut down in the suburbs where it first went out\r\nThey've been asking, asking the question\n\n\n\nAre you afraid of the darkness?\n\nAre you afraid of the darkness?\n\nI'm afraid of the darkness too\n\n\n\nIn the hospital\n\nOn the critical ward\n\nToo long a breath between\n\nThe break and the backup of a life support\n\nOne system failure and it stopped her heart\n\nOne power vacuum and we're coming apart\n\nWe should be asking, asking the question\n\n\n\nAre you afraid of the darkness?\n\nAre you afraid of the darkness?\n\nI'm afraid of the darkness too\n\nWe're all caught in the blackout\n\nTrying to feel our way out\n\nWait for the morning\n\nI'll be waiting for you\n\n\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nBring a burning candle with you\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nI will be there waiting for you\n\n\n\nI was in my comfort zone\n\nI was singing selfish songs\n\nI've been taking for granted everyone understood how easy trouble comes\n\nBut it's not enough anymore\n\nWe can't turn just around and close the door on the world\n\nIt's asking uneasy questions\n\nWe should be asking ourselves uneasy questions\n\n\n\nAre you afraid of the darkness?\n\nAre you afraid of the darkness?\n\nI'm afraid of the darkness too\n\nWe're all caught in the blackout\n\nTrying to feel our way out\n\nWait for the morning\n\nI'll be waiting for you\n\n\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nBring a burning candle with you\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nI will be there waiting for you\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nMeet me in the middle\n\nBring a burning candle with you\n\nMeet me in the middle",
