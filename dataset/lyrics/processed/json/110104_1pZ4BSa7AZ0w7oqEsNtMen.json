  "lyrics": "For the light sleeper, the street sweeper,\r\nPromise breaker, promise keeper,\r\nThe astronaut, the acrobat,\r\nThe underdog who is coming back.\r\nMaybe you're Hooked On Phonics or Mary Jane;\r\nCoca Cola or cocaine.\n\nWe're just a different kind of the same, yeah.\n\nSticks and stones can break you.\n\n\n\nBut words are medicine, words are medicine.\n\nWhen I'm black and blue, I'm broken and bruised,\n\nI hear your voice again.\n\nWords are medicine.\n\n\n\nThe beautician, the mortician,\n\nThe blinded sided, the night vision,\n\nThe baptized, the chicken fried,\n\nThe rolled tide, the unforgiven.\n\n\n\nFor the girl who is lost in romance novels,\n\nThe guy who sees through whiskey goggles\n\nWe're just a different kind of the same, yeah.\n\nSticks and stones can break you.\n\n\n\nBut words are medicine, words are medicine.\n\nWhen you're black and blue, you're broken and bruised,\n\nJust hear my voice again:\n\nWords are medicine.\n\n\n\nI do. I will.\n\nI believe in you still.\n\nI have a dream.\n\nImagine.\n\nA shiny city on a hill.\n\nI'm sorry. Forgive me.\n\nI love you.\n\nI love you.\n\n\n\nWords are medicine. Words are medicine.\n\nWhen you're black and blue, you're broken and bruised,\n\nJust hear my voice again:\n\nWords are medicine. Words are medicine.\n\nWhen we're black and blue, we're broken and bruised,\n\nI hear your song , my friend.\n\nWords are medicine. Words are medicine.\n\nWords are medicine. Words are medicine.",
