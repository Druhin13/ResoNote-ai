  "lyrics": "We met on a Wednesday\r\nIn the summer, it was blazing\r\nYou looked at my black jeans, said are you crazy?\r\nI guess I might have laughed\r\nAnd after that you stuck to me like glue\r\nBut you had a girl at home and too many tattoos\n\nI was in a rough patch, real depressed\n\nYou took my hand and said the sun it rises in the east but I came from the west\n\nMy heart it skipped and that was that\n\nI should have known don't trust a poet\n\nCause they can't do the math\n\n\n\nI'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time\n\nHeaded on a bad trip with the wrong high\n\nI don't really know why\n\nBut you felt right to me\n\nI hadn't had a good thing in a long time\n\nMoving in the fast lane with the wrong guy\n\nI don't really know why\n\nBut you felt right to me\n\nWe met on a Friday\n\nIn the winter, it was freezing\n\nFelt a bit like history repeating\n\nWe'd been on a break but then decided we could try to spend the night like friends and roam the city\n\nKnowing what that meant\n\nSo we were back & I was pouring poison\n\nTexting you reports from everywhere I went\n\nAnd you'd write back I miss you even more\n\nAnd it was torture for me\n\nI should have known don't trust a poet\n\nCause they prefer to bleed\n\n\n\nI'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time\n\nHeaded on a bad trip with the wrong high\n\nI don't really know why\n\nBut you felt right to me\n\nI hadn't had a good thing in a long time\n\nMoving in the fast lane with the wrong guy\n\nI don't really know why\n\nBut you felt right to me\n\n\n\nWrote this on a Sunday after months out on the road\n\nWonder if you have regrets and which direction those thoughts go\n\nLike was it worth it in the end?\n\nSometimes it feels like you just used me for my mind & innocence\n\nAnd now I heard you had a kid, finished a book & got a wife\n\nThings been good to you since that last goodbye\n\nBut I just have to say my piece\n\nYou should have known don't trust a poet\n\nCause we know how to speak",
