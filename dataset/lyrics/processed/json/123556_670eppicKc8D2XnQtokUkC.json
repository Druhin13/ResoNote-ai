Baby, you can bet your\n\nEver since I met you, got a new buzz on\n\nGot a new buzz on\n\n\n\nI poured my share of Maker's\n\nToked a little smoke\n\nI been moonshine blind\n\nA couple times, and all I know is\n\nWhen you put your fingers on me and hit me with a touch, it's too much\n\nIt's too much\n\n\n\nI got a new buzz on ever since I met you\n\nGot a new buzz on, yeah, I'm feelin' good\n\nAm I too far gone? Baby, you can bet your\n\nEver since I met you, got a new buzz on\n\n\n\nAnd ooh-wee, what you got me on\n\nIt's too easy\n\nKeep me comin' back, then you go and tease me\n\nWell, that \"Come and get me\" look, yeah\n\nI'm hooked, I'm hooked\n\n\n\nI got a new buzz on ever since I met you\n\nGot a new buzz on, yeah, I'm feelin' good\n\nAm I too far gone? Baby, you can bet your\n\nEver since I met you, got a new buzz on\n\nGot a new buzz on\n\n\n\nI got a new buzz on ever since I met you\n\nGot a new buzz on, yeah, I'm feelin' good\n\nAm I too far gone? Baby, you can bet your\n\nEver since I met you, ever since I met you\n\nGot a new buzz on\n\nEver since I met you I got a new buzz on",
