  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Come Home to Me par LÉON\r\nI left in the pouring rain\nSaying I wouldn't be home again\nI get so caught between everything I feel\nI'm stubborn and I won't say sorry\nWrite it out 'cause I know that you worry\nWondering where I've been\nGot you questioning\n\nThese tears are making me blind\nI don't know why\nI start a forest fire and burn us down\nBut you know at the end of the night, I'll come around\n\nMaybe I did you wrong and made you bleed\nMaybe you made mistakes and it got me on my knees\n\nAnd maybe we're a mess, but it works for me\n'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me\n\nYou keep to your side of the bed now\nCold shoulder turning your head\nSaying things that you don't mean\nPainful honesty\nYou cut me right through the centre\nThrow my hands up but I won't surrender\nBut when did words become all our weapons? Mmm\n\nThese tears are making me blind\nI don't know why\nWe start a forest fire and burn us down\nBut I know at the end of the night, you'll come around\n\n\nMaybe I did you wrong and made you bleed\nMaybe you made mistakes and it got me on my knees\nAnd maybe we're a mess, but it works for me\n'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home\n\nHome love, hold me closer\n'Til we're old 'cause you know that in your arms I feel like\nHome love, take me over\nSay you know now\nYou know, you know, you know, you know\n\nMaybe I did you wrong and made you bleed\nMaybe you made mistakes and it got me off my feet\nAnd maybe we're just a mess, but it works for me\n'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me\n\n\nCome home, come home, come home",
