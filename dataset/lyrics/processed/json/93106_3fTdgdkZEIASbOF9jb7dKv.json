  "lyrics": "Life ain't always easy, there's no comfort with growth\r\nLearn your subconscious, just stay conscious, there's a good and bad road\r\nYou need to slow down, baby\r\nDon't let 'em manipulate your smile\r\nYou need to slow down, baby\r\nYou need to slow down, down, down\n\n\n\nAskin' myself, \"What kind of life is this?\"\n\nGotta be reminded when you might forget\n\nWasn't raised like this but she like the shit (Like the shit)\n\nKillin' me softly\n\nHow do I live when I know you got a family? We ain't spoke in days (Spoke in days)\n\nBreakin' my heart that the choice was made (Choice was made)\n\nGet your way when your voice is praised (Voice is praised)\n\nI'm contemplatin' goin' out in a blaze\n\nYo, how you go through life without a call from me?\n\nEvery day I'm learnin' in life that talk is cheap\n\nI guess it's too many movin' parts to see (Parts to see)\n\nAnd I don't know it all but you look lost to me (Lost to me)\n\nAnd you might feel stuck with the film attached\n\nIt's never too late for a different path\n\nYou got a whole family to convince you that\n\nI love you and I miss you bad, just hear me out, love\n\n\n\nLife ain't always easy, there's no comfort with growth\n\nLearn your subconscious, just stay conscious, there's a good and bad road\n\nYou need to slow down, baby\n\nDon't let 'em manipulate your smile\n\nYou need to slow down, baby\n\nYou need to slow down, down, down\n\n\n\nYo, everybody's lookin' for somebody to blame\n\nWe all livin' life but is the challenge the same?\n\nGot everything to gain until the salary change\n\nYou can see the obvious when the pattern's the same (Pattern's the same)\n\nManipulated to forgettin' the facts (Forgettin' the facts)\n\nWhat's the price to retrace the tracks?\n\nNow everybody talkin' 'bout the life you had\n\n'Cause we ain't see the signs which is twice as bad (Twice as bad)\n\nLook, you ain't judgin' and it ain't your business\n\nDidn't know creatin' space would create a vent\n\nAnd everything you sayin' to me might be true\n\nBut, real talk, all women gotta break the system (Break the system)\n\nThe way you gettin' treated is disappointin' to see (Disappointin' to see)\n\nFeelin' like I got a gun pointed at me (Pointed at me)\n\nYou know when you got somethin' that only you can see?\n\nI can't wait 'til we all get free, just hear me out, love\n\n\n\nLife ain't always easy, there's no comfort with growth\n\nLearn your subconscious, just stay conscious, there's a good and bad road\n\nYou need to slow down, baby\n\nDon't let 'em manipulate your smile\n\nYou need to slow down, baby\n\nYou need to slow down, down, down",
