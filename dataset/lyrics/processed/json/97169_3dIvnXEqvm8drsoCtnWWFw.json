  "lyrics": "White collar, blue collar, hillbilly, high dollar\r\nHot head, pot head, non-believer, holy water\r\nBig city, small town, y'all take a look around\r\nPeople are different\r\nHeavy metal, hip hop, steel toe, flip flops\r\nSip it slow, cold beer, hits you fast, whiskey shot\n\nAccent North, South, good as gold, sailor mouth\n\nPeople are different\n\n\n\nYeah, we all know it's true\n\nBut it don't mean that me and you\n\n\n\nCan't walk down a street and smile at a stranger\n\nHeart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor\n\nNo matter what shape, no matter what color\n\nBreak bread instead of fighting each other\n\nSlip on a pair of another man's shoes\n\nYou'll see by the time you get back\n\nThis old world would be a whole lot better place\n\nIf we'd all just embrace the fact\n\nThat people are different\n\nPeople are different\n\n\n\nLeft wing, right wing, jail house, freedom ring\n\nOld school, new school, everything in-between\n\nLike a snowflake, no fingerprint's the same\n\nAnd people are different\n\n\n\nI wish that it was something that we all understood\n\nLord knows it'd do us all some good\n\n\n\nTo walk down a street and smile at a stranger\n\nHeart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor\n\nNo matter what shape, no matter what color\n\nBreak bread instead of fighting each other\n\nSlip on a pair of another man's shoes\n\nYou'll see by the time you get back\n\nThis old world would be a whole lot better place\n\nIf we'd all just embrace the fact\n\nThat people are different\n\nYeah, people are different\n\n\n\nYou can turn on the TV\n\nChange the channel if you don't like what you see\n\nYou can get your money back if it ain't your size\n\nYou can throw it in the trash if you don't like it\n\nBut listen, people are different\n\n\n\nSo walk down the street and smile at a stranger\n\nHeart on your sleeve and love thy neighbor\n\nNo matter what shape, no matter what color\n\nBreak bread instead of fighting each other\n\nSlip on a pair of another man's shoes\n\nYou'll see by the time you get back\n\nThis old world would be a whole lot better place\n\nIf we'd all just embrace the fact\n\nThat people are different\n\nPeople are different\n\nPeople are different\n\nWhoa, yeah",
