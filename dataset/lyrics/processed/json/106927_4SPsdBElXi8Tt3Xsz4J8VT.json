Yeah\n\nIt's the only thing that we can't shake off, can't shake off\n\n\n\nWhen you find somebody new\n\nWill you be thinking of me?\n\nWhen you find somebody else\n\nWill you be thinking of us?\n\n'Cause I'll be thinking of you\n\nI don't know\n\n\n\nWhat to do with this love\n\nWhat do we do with it?\n\nWhat do we do with these feelings\n\nStuck inside of us? (stuck inside of us)\n\nWhat do we do with this love?\n\nWhat do we do with it?\n\nIt's the only thing that we can't shake off (oh no)\n\nWhat do we do with it?\n\nSo what do we do with it?\n\nWhat do we do with this love?\n\nWhat do we do with it?",
