  "lyrics": "You've got me stuck to where I'm sitting\r\nLooking at your eyes\r\nThen I know I'm so pathetic\r\nI wouldn't move to save my life\r\nThey tell me that you're lonely\n\nIt's no surprise, when you walk around all day\n\nWearing those lonely, lonely, lonely\n\nLonely eyes\n\n\n\nWell, I try to tell you jokes\n\nI'm afraid you'd cry\n\nAnd if you need a little sunshine\n\nYou can borrow some of mine\n\n\n\n\"It's okay if you're unhappy\"\n\nI would say before I leave her\n\nJust take a look around\n\nThere's no one here that's happy either\n\n\n\nLonely girl, you are my world\n\nAnd I could be anything you need\n\nAnd if for some reason you don't feel like talking\n\nI could just sit and enjoy your company\n\nYour company\n\n\n\nThe days keep going by\n\nAnd it doesn't get much better\n\nIt could be threatening to jump\n\nAnd all of your friends would just scream\n\n(\"Let her!\")\n\n\n\nThey count on you to leave\n\n'Cause it has always been that way\n\nBut on the one day they close early\n\nThat's the one you want to stay\n\n\n\nLonely girl, you are my world\n\nAnd I could be anything you need\n\nAnd if for some reason you don't feel like talking\n\nI'd just sit and enjoy your company\n\nYour company\n\n\n\nLonely girl, you are my world\n\nAnd I could be anything you need\n\nAnd if for some reason you don't feel like talking\n\nI could just sit and enjoy your company\n\nYour company\n\nYour company",
