  "lyrics": "There was a time I looked at you\r\nAnd you saw me\r\nThere was a place that I once knew\r\nThen you sought me\r\nWent to the ocean to find new\r\nPerspective\r\nFigured it out and now I know\r\nThere's no connection\r\nThere's nothin to do but fall in love with you\r\nI'll figure it out sometime\r\nWhen everything's new I'll finally find the truth\r\nHidden behind the lies\r\nEverything falls and no ones left behind\r\nYou find it in the sunshine\r\nFind it in the sunshine\r\nHeard someone say that's it's a ruse\r\nAnd I'm failing\r\nThat may be true but life's a page\r\nAnd it's turning\r\nThings might be real but I'm awake\r\nAnd I'm laughing\r\nCause since I'm alive and there's a hook\r\nI'm not drowning\r\nThere's nothin to do but fall in love with you\r\nI'll figure it out sometime\r\nWhen everything's new I'll finally find the truth\r\nHidden behind the lies\r\nEverything falls and no ones left behind\r\nYou find it in the sunshine\r\nFind it in the sunshine\r\nFind it in the sunshine",
