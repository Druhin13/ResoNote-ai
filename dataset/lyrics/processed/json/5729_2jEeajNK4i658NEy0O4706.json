  "lyrics": "I wandered away, I wandered away in the morning\r\nI wandered away, I wandered away [?]\r\nYou held me but you couldn't understand me\r\nYou held me and it eased your mind\r\nIt took a long time, it took a long time for me to breathe\n\nI stood at your door and you found me when you left\n\nYou held me but you couldn't seem to change me\n\nYou held me and it eased your mind\n\n\n\nStill I feel lost, I feel lost\n\nI feel lost, I feel lost\n\nI made you wait and I longed for the night\n\nStill I feel lost when I close my eyes\n\n\n\nI'll never forget how I never went down to the river\n\nAnd I'll never forget I couldn't take care of myself\n\nYou held me but you couldn't understand me\n\nYou held me and it eased your mind\n\n\n\nStill I feel lost, I feel lost\n\nI feel lost, I feel lost\n\nI made you wait and I longed for the night\n\nStill I feel lost when I close my eyes\n\nAnd I close my eyes\n\nAnd I close my eyes",
