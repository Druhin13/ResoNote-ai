  "lyrics": "I always lock the door, 'cause you never know for sure\r\nWho your neighbors really are, real suspicious\r\nI made my way outside in the California skies\r\nBut I couldn't feel the sunny disposition\r\nOh, bet you can imagine how I'm sinking\n\n\n\nThey were standing side by side, just like mugs along the shelf\n\nWith their glaze and overrise, they couldn't help it\n\nAnd no matter how I try, I just couldn't feel alive\n\nI just stepped right into line, they never felt it\n\n\n\nOh, bet you can imagine how I'm sinking\n\nOh, oh, when the signal's always busy, baby\n\n\n\nBut like Jane Doe and her John, all of us just carried on\n\nI was looking for somebody who could shake me\n\nOh, I always lock the door 'cause you never know for sure\n\nWho your neighbors really are, maybe they'll save me\n\n\n\nOh, bet you can imagine how I'm sinking\n\nOh, oh, when the signal's always busy, baby\n\n\n\nI'm still reeling here, maybe some sign will appear\n\nI guess I hope it comes\n\nIt's like I'm twiddling my thumbs, sometimes I can't believe\n\nI get so numb\n\nYou think I would've figured it out by now\n\nYou're not the only one\n\n\n\nOh, bet you can imagine how I'm sinking\n\nOh, oh, when the signal's always busy, baby\n\n\n\nOh, won't somebody shake me?\n\nOh, oh, signal's loud, but it's still busy, baby",
