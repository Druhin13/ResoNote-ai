  "lyrics": "Swallowing the feeling\r\nCounting cracks across the ceiling\r\nNever reached the depths of them before\r\nFinding flaws in every format\r\nI know but haven't shown that\r\nI could pick myself up of the floor\n\n\n\nI'll fill my glass to take the edge off\n\nThe choice is mine\n\n\n\nFrom the outside\n\nI seem fine\n\nOn the inside I'm still sick\n\nThe pills a temporary fix\n\nFrom the outside\n\nI seem fine\n\n\n\nWay to find my bottom with these empty orange bottles\n\nNever felt so paralyzed before (never felt this paralyzed)\n\nWe were looking for some answers\n\nWith the hang this broken lantern\n\nGrowing ever closer to the floor\n\n\n\nI'll fill my glass to take the edge off\n\nThe choice is mine\n\n\n\nFrom the outside\n\nI seem fine\n\nOn the inside I'm still sick\n\nThe pills a temporary fix\n\nFrom the outside\n\nI seem fine\n\n\n\nWhy do I? why do I? feel so damn cold\n\nWhy am I? why am I? still so old\n\nWhy should I? why should I? get up or get out\n\nWhy should I?\n\n\n\nFrom the outside\n\nI seem fine\n\nOn the inside I'm still sick\n\nThe pills a temporary fix\n\nFrom the outside\n\nI seem fine\n\nI seem fine\n\nOn the inside I'm still sick\n\nThe pills a temporary fix\n\nFrom the outside",
