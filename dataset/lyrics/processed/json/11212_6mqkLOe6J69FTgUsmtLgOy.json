  "lyrics": "All I see is the chase\r\nI'm on the run like a rockstar in a stock car\r\nThat's driven by the fear of being replaced\r\nFear of being erased, another day at the race\r\nTo the finish line where nothing significant awaits\r\nMy people listen to me and say when they listen to me\n\nAll they hear is the greats\n\nBut I can't listen to it cause all I hear is mistakes\n\nI'm on a mission to optimize the vision\n\nSeparate the hisses from the kisses and recognize the snakes\n\nSlithering in the garden, hoping I'd be tender hearted\n\nAnd go and force MD's to go and give me something for the ache\n\nGet deluded off Dilaudid, or go and cop a car cause it's cathartic\n\nMan I just need a break\n\nBut never fear, it was a heavy year sorry for the wait\n\nFucking right, such is life\n\n\n\nAlways by your side\n\nAlways by your side\n\nAlways by your side\n\nAlways by your\n\n\n\nI'm walking on the verge with a verve\n\nCause I deserve to sing a joyful song and not a dirge\n\nThrough all the darkness I emerged\n\nControl your urge or them boys gon' go get it crackin' off\n\nNiggas walk in the clubs looking at broads\n\nBut walkin out lookin at 3-5 on a agg assault\n\nNiggas is animals\n\nThey all dog eat dog straight cannibal\n\nOx with a cold vein catalogue\n\nDusted off the Xannys and the Adderalls\n\nDestined to lead us all to the catacombs\n\nI guess I can't be mad at all\n\nIt's just reality\n\nSo I let melody be medicine for malady\n\nSing a simple song, fuck the formalities\n\nI refuse to be a casualty\n\nWanderlust man I'm traveling off another flight\n\nClose your eyes breath deep, just another night\n\nFucking right, such is life\n\n\n\nAlways by your side\n\nAlways by your side\n\nAlways by your side\n\nAlways by your\n\n\n\nThe countdown is progressing\n\nAnd your spaceship is about to blast off on a voyage of discovery\n\n\n\nYou are not what you do\n\nWhat you are is how you do it\n\nYou are not what you do\n\nWhat you are is how you do it\n\nYou are not what you do\n\nWhat you are is how you do it\n\nYou are not what you do\n\nWhat you are is how you do it\n\nYou are not what you do\n\nWhat you are is how you do it\n\nYou are not what you do\n\nWhat you",
