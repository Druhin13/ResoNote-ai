  "lyrics": "Fuck it, it's late, can we go back\r\nCan we go back to your place?\r\nI know I usually say, \"I don't do this\"\r\nBut I would be lying anyway\r\nFuck it, we're here\r\nAnd all sluring turned to crying\n\n'Cause I must've had one too many drinks\n\n\n\nFor everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt\n\nDid you hear the sirens blow?\n\nFor everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt\n\nGuess I'll see you down in hell\n\n\n\nAnd I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes\n\nAnd I took your voice 'cause I loved to lie\n\nAnd I weighed you down, so I learned to fly\n\nLast night I made you cry\n\n\n\nRemember that time\n\nThat I told you I was all alone, I lied\n\nI never do what's right\n\nI said my phone was dead\n\nBut your sister tried to call me on her way\n\nShe never liked me much\n\n\n\nFor everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt\n\nDid you hear the sirens blow?\n\nFor everyone I've hurt, everyone I've hurt\n\nGuess I'll see you down in hell\n\n\n\nAnd I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes\n\nAnd I took your voice 'cause I loved to lie\n\nAnd I weighed you down, so I learned to fly\n\nLast night I made you cry\n\n\n\nAnd I told you one and I told you twice\n\nThat I let you go just to watch you fall\n\nAnd I told you one and I told you twice\n\n\n\nAnd I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes\n\nAnd I took your voice 'cause I loved to lie\n\nAnd I weighed you down, so I learned to fly\n\nLast night I made you cry\n\n\n\nAnd I blinded you 'cause I loved your eyes\n\nAnd I took your voice 'cause I loved to lie\n\nAnd I weighed you down, so I learned to fly\n\nLast night I made you cry",
