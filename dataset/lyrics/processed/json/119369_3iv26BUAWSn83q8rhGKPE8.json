And welcome aboard, Flight 22\r\nBeen a lot of places, seen a lot of faces, yeah\r\nBut nothing like you (you, you, you)\r\nOh, met you at the airport\n\nFlight 22 (two, two, two)\n\nI want you to have it all (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)\n\nI want you to have it all (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)\n\nI wonder if you really know\n\nWhat I do for you to have it\n\nI've had it with the waiting and hesitating\n\n\n\nNow, Flight 22\n\n\n\nI know you've been patient\n\nThat's an understatement, yeah\n\nBut what can I do (do, do, do)\n\nOh, make myself look silly\n\nHoping that you hear me\n\nAll my girls say that I'm acting a fool\n\nNow touch me, kiss me, catch me, or miss me\n\nGive it, take it, you can't mistake this\n\nLet's get away from it all\n\n\n\nFlight 22\n\n\n\nAnd baby we're not gonna make it\n\nAt least I'm going down with you\n\nMy baggage might just be too full\n\nOn Flight 22\n\n\n\nFlight 22\n\nFlight 22",
