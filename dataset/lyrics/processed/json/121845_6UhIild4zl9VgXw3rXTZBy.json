I'm nervous\n\nSwimming into the deep blue, deep blue secret\n\n\n\nI'm feeling like fever, running through the night\n\nTear you open, tear you open, see what's inside\n\nI'm feeling like fever, baby you know I'm right, I'm right\n\n\n\nWe ain't got no consequences, yeah\n\nWe tear shit up 'cause we just don't feel the end\n\nFeeling like fever, yeah\n\nWe ain't got no consequences, yeah\n\nWe burn it now like Ceasar and we'd do it again\n\nFeeling like fever, fever yeah",
