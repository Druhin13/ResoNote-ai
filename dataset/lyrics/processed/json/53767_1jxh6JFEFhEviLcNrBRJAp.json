  "lyrics": "I am he that move in the valleys\r\nOf the damned, making haste\r\nPersistent like the rasps at chains of the world\r\nInto perpetual dementia the crossroads twirl\r\nHere at the eye of the storm\n\nBut from an unusual tree my cane was cut\n\nAnd it is ever by my side\n\n\n\nWherever leads the trail\n\nWhatever burden that oppress the heart\n\nWhere sorrows thrive\n\nAnd shadows linger everlasting\n\nOn vacant thrones\n\n\n\nBehold a river aflow\n\nWinding and twisting, back to its source\n\nThere goes our way\n\nThrough everlasting decay\n\nTo where the Temple stands eternally\n\n\n\nOurs is a path of power\n\nEdged by the remmants of the slain\n\nLong have we walked upon it\n\nBut ours is the patience of the pilgrim\n\nWho journeys against the tide\n\nEver towards the Sanctuary\n\nBeyond the shores of life and Death\n\n\n\nFor it has made me a defier of every law\n\nThat robs my kind of liberty and grace\n\nI am he that move in the valleys of the damned\n\nAnd none shall lessen my pace\n\n\n\nBesieged, expired and undone\n\nThe waste, from whence I am gone\n\n\n\nBehold the last of stars ascend\n\nTo mark the return\n\nTo the night without end\n\n\n\nWhere goes our way\n\nThrough everlasting decay\n\nTo where, the Temple stands eternally\n\n\n\nIn words, in deed\n\nIn scars that ever bleed\n\nOn towards the Sanctuary forever\n\nOurs in triumph and eternal Death",
