  "lyrics": "I'm patiently waiting for you to arrive\r\nI wanna meet you so much I could cry\r\nI wonder who's hands and who's eyes you will have\r\nI wonder if you're gonna smile like your dad\r\nAnd nothing you ever do will be so wrong\r\nYou belong, you belong\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna help you be better than me\n\nThere won't be a star in the sky you can't reach\n\nI'll wipe off your tears but I'll let them fall first\n\nAnd I will be brave when you fall and get hurt\n\nYou can be you, you don't have to be strong\n\n'Cause you belong, you belong\n\nYou belong, you know\n\n\n\nI don't know your name\n\nBut I can't wait to say it\n\nAnd I don't know your face\n\nBut I bet it will blow me away\n\n\n\nI'll show you what love is and all that you're worth\n\nYou show me how to put somebody else first\n\nI hope you like music as much as your mom\n\nThat you'll understand that I'm there when I'm gone\n\nThis is probably too much for me to say in a song\n\nBut you belong, you belong, yeah\n\nYou belong, you know\n\n\n\nI don't know your name\n\nBut I can't wait to say it\n\nAnd I don't know your face\n\nBut I know it will blow me away\n\n\n\nI'm feeling and watching you grow everyday\n\nIt's so amazing, so why am I afraid?\n\nWe packed up to move in, we're painting your room\n\nI can't believe I'll be holding you soon\n\nSafe in my arms when you finally come\n\nYou belong, you belong\n\nYou belong, you belong\n\nThat was the cutest thing",
