  "lyrics": "Ten years living in a paperbag\r\nFeedback baby, he's a flipped out cat\r\nHe's a platinum canary, drinkin' falstaff beer\r\nMercedes rule, and a rented lear\r\nBotton feeder insincere\r\nProphet lo-fi pioneer\n\nSell the house and go to school\n\nGet a young girlfriend, daddy's jewel\n\nA change would do you good\n\nA change would do you good\n\n\n\nGod's little gift is on the rag\n\nPoster girl posing in a fashion mag\n\nCanine, feline, Jekyll and Hyde\n\nWear your fake fur on the inside\n\nQueen of south beach, aging blues\n\nDinner's at six, wear your cement shoes\n\nI thought you were singing your heart out to me\n\nYour lips were syncing and now I see\n\n\n\nA change would do you good\n\nA change would do you good\n\n\n\nChasing dragons with plastic swords\n\nJack off Jimmy, everybody wants more\n\nScully and angel on the kitchen floor\n\nAnd I'm calling Buddy on the ouija board\n\nI've been thinking 'bout catching a train\n\nLeave my phone machine by the radar range\n\nHello it's me, I'm not at home\n\nIf you'd like to reach me, leave me alone\n\n\n\nA change would do you good\n\nA change would do you good\n\nHello, it's me, I'm not at home\n\nIf you'd like to reach me, leave me alone\n\n\n\nA change would do you good\n\nA change would do you good",
