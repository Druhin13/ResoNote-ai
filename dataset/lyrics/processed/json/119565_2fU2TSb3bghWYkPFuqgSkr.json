Fuck 'em\n\nEast Atlanta king and I mean every letter\n\nBut when I'm good, I'm good, when I'm bad, I'm better\n\nThe man of the method, it's a method to the madness\n\nI'm stepping in my bag with the cannon, step back\n\nRepping the city, showing love that I don't ever get back\n\nBut that's the plight of a player, plot an attack and rocking and rapping\n\nRippin' rappers off of the fuckin' map, suckers suffer, succotash\n\nI need that Mark Zucker bag, Zuckerberg\n\nHovercraft flows, I don't fuck with that, bullshit below\n\nFrom the ceiling to the floor, full schizo for the dough\n\nNew pistol, but I know I'm planting seeds so they can grow\n\nBut if they don't, then I don't know\n\n\n\nJust the other day I was goddamn broke\n\nYou got a five, I got a five, let's smoke\n\nJust the other day I was running from them folks\n\nLike (woah, woah) niggas is too slow\n\nJust the other day I was telling all my bros\n\n(Woah, woah) Nigga it's time to go\n\nJust the other day I was goddamn broke\n\nJust the other day I was, yeah",
