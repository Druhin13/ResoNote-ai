I mean, am I the only one hear who don't know what the fuck is going on? I worked the last ten years. I'm a multimillionaire. I'm thirty years old, it's supposed to all be good. It is not fucking all good. And see, no one's really sure how long we were there for. Some say a few hours, others say a few years. All I know is a funny thing happens when you look in someone's eyes for that long: you start to see their face unravel, you start to see their most beautiful and their most disgusting parts; you start to see that those are actually the same thing; you start to see them disappear; you start to see your mother; see them; see you; you start to see tears, and you ain't sure who they belong to; let 'em fall\n\n\n\nDrip, drip, drip (Fuck, fuck, fuck, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)\n\nDrip, drip, drip (Fuck, fuck, fuck, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)\n\nYour eyes, your lies are gorgeous (Drip)\n\nYour eyes, your lies are gorgeous\n\n(Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip)\n\n\n\nDrip\n\nDrip\n\nDrip\n\nI don't remember you ever running away in the time for school classes, you must have. Do you?\n\nYeah\n\nDid you get caught? What happened to you?\n\nI feel like I'm always running away",
