  "lyrics": "Found you in your Calvin Klein's\r\nWouldn't let me know if I'm right\r\nNever been the one for small talk\r\nKeep postponing most my problems\r\nBut the moment wasn't set in stone\n\nIts more that I'm not warm in tone\n\nWho's more broken then? Can't you see?\n\nWon't take my hand, can't start with me\n\n\n\nI heard one little promise and\n\nI'm bursting at the seams\n\nNever thought you'd help me more\n\nAm I ever coming clean\n\nI thought you knew where I was headed for\n\nThey're taking selfies in the bathroom\n\n\n\nI had one little promise\n\nAnd I'm bursting at the seams\n\nAhahoo\n\nSelfies in the bathroom\n\nYou doubt it cause it's too soon\n\nIt's too soon\n\n\n\nBianca, do I love ya\n\nMight've fallen little too quick for ya\n\nBut I never thought you'd hold me back so\n\nBut I never thought you'd hold me back so much\n\nAlways in a different place\n\nMy ship fly to space\n\nI never come back too much\n\nBetter runaway\n\nNow we runaway\n\nBetter runaway\n\nLiving for today\n\n\n\nI don't want to keep on playing games\n\nThank the lord you stopped\n\nThat was quite a pain\n\nOften left me questioning\n\nWas it passion that brought you to my door\n\nEvery Saturday\n\nEvery Saturday\n\nEvery Saturday\n\n\n\n\"Just cause you're beautiful doesn't mean you can treat people like they don't matter, I really liked you\"\n\n\n\nI heard one little promise and\n\nI'm bursting at the seams\n\nNever thought you'd help me more\n\nAm I ever coming clean\n\nI thought you knew where I was headed for\n\nThey're taking selfies in the bathroom\n\n\n\nI had one little promise\n\nAnd I'm bursting at the seams\n\nAhahoo\n\nSelfies in the bathroom\n\nYou doubt it cause it's too soon\n\nIt's too soon\n\n\n\nWould you mind if I took your hand\n\nKnow you got things planned\n\nBut your smile says you want golden sand\n\nSmile says you want golden sand\n\nAgreed putting this on you was unfair\n\nYou're not Tiffany, I won't overbear\n\n\n\nBroke your promise\n\nWho am I to feel discouraged\n\nFor you aren't in a cage\n\nYou aren't in a cage\n\nThat's enough for me\n\nThat's enough for me\n\n\n\nWho would you follow to the ends of the earth\n\nI think I broke it when I took my turn\n\nWhere is my worth\n\nHow much of my worth is in you\n\n\n\nWho wasted the boys time\n\nBlame it on myself\n\nI'm nothing\n\nCan't help it",
