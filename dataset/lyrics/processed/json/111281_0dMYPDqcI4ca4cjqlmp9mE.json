  "lyrics": "I have lived in darkness\r\nFor all my life, I've been pursued\r\nYou'd be afraid if you could feel my pain\r\nAnd if you could see the things I am able to see\r\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nLet me flee\n\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nSet me free\n\n\n\nI hail from the darker side\n\nFor all my life, I've been besieged\n\nYou'd be scared living with my despair\n\nAnd if you could feel the things, I am able to feel\n\n\n\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nLet me flee\n\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nSet me free\n\n\n\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nLet me flee\n\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nSet me free\n\nSave me from the dark side\n\nBreak me out, break me out\n\nSet me free",
