  "lyrics": "There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar\r\nGreat expectations, everybody's watching you.\r\nPeople you meet, they all seem to know you.\r\nEven your old friends treat you like you're somethin' new.\r\nJohnny come lately\n\nThe new kid in town\n\nEverybody loves you\n\nSo don't let them down.\n\n\n\nThere's so many things\n\nYou should have told her\n\nBut night after night \n\nYou're willing to hold her\n\nJust hold her\n\nTears on your shoulder\n\n\n\nThere's talk on the street, it's there to remind you\n\nIt doesn't really matter which side you're on \n\nYou're walkin' away and they're talkin' behind you \n\nThey will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along \n\n\n\nWhere you been lately? \n\nThere's a new kid in town \n\nEverybody loves him (don't they?) \n\nNow he's holdin' her and you're still around \n\n\n\nThere's a new kid in town \n\njust another new kid in town \n\nEverybody's talkin' 'bout the new kid in town \n\nEverybody's walkin' (Like the new kid in town) \n\nThere's a new kid in town (I don't wanna hear it).",
