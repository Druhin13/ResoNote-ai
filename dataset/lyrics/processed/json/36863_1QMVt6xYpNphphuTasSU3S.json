  "lyrics": "Hold on, I think the game is over \nHold on, and try again to feel all right \nHold on, and put the slow on feeling \nHold on, you see they're all just uptight \n\nHold on, you're gonna feel so fine \n\nHold on, don't take it, set you right \n\nHold on, you're got to move to try \n\nHold on, you'd better step my way \n\n\n\nRemember when there was no sigh \n\nRemember all the time gone by \n\nRemember when you used to smile \n\nAnd keep it in your bloody mind \n\n\n\nRemember all the time how good \n\nRemember that's all up to you \n\nRemember when I was the top \n\nKeep your thanks and then just tell me \n\nWhy... Tell me why \n\n\n\nHold on, you're on your own today \n\nHold on, you walk on down, they see all right \n\nHold on, put your cares to sleep! Dig it on that funky beat \n\nYou just can't on feeling sad \n\nTake it bad like a jilted lover",
