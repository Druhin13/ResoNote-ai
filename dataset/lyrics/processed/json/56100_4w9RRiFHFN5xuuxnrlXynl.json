  "lyrics": "Ivy growing up on the bleeding walls\r\nEvery leaf a breath of the story\r\nAutumn and they all fall down\r\nNow I’m seeing clearly how\r\nHeavy is our glory\n\nBecause I won't find it\n\nThere's no one quite like you\n\nAnd I still hold on, entangled in your roots\n\nJust like I was fifteen summers young\n\nAnd I closed my eyes, I knew you’d come\n\nAs I imagined someone like, someone like... like you\n\n\n\nSomeone like, someone like... someone like you\n\nSomeone like, someone like... someone like you\n\n\n\nSo tell me where the nomad wanders on\n\nIs it in a world untravelled?\n\nIs it where the music plays?\n\nFilling up the empty space\n\nIt's where you left me fragile\n\n\n\nBecause I won’t find it, there's no one quite like you\n\nAnd I still hold on, entangled in your roots\n\nJust like I was fifteen summers young\n\nAnd I closed my eyes, I knew you’d come\n\nAs I imagined someone like, someone like... like you\n\n\n\nSomeone like, someone like... someone like you\n\nSomeone like, someone like... someone like you\n\n\n\nSomeone like, someone like\n\nSomeone like, someone like, like you\n\n\n\nSomeone like, someone like\n\nSomeone like, someone like\n\nSomeone like, someone like\n\nSomeone like you\n\n\n\nBecause I won't find it, there's no one quite like you\n\n(Someone like you)\n\nAnd I still hold on, entangled in your roots\n\n(Someone like you)\n\nJust like I was fifteen summers young\n\nAnd I closed my eyes, I knew you’d come\n\n(Someone like you)\n\nAs I imagined someone like, someone like ... like you",
