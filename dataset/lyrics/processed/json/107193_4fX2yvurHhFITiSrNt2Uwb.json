  "lyrics": "I came home to an empty house\r\nAnd I found your little note\r\n\"Don't wait up for me tonight\"\r\nAnd that was all she wrote\r\nDo you think I don't know that you're out on the town\n\nWith all of your high-rollin' friends?\n\nWhat do you do when you come up empty?\n\nWhere do you go when the party ends?\n\n\n\nAnd you were just too busy being fabulous\n\nToo busy to think about us\n\nI don't know what you were dreaming of\n\nSomehow you forgot about love\n\nAnd you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh\n\n\n\nA little time in the country\n\nA day or two to slow down\n\nA bottle of wine and a walk in the moonlight\n\nMaybe some foolin' around\n\n\n\nBut you think time is just a magazine\n\nAnd money's just a thrill\n\nI've waited so long for you to change your way of livin'\n\nNow I realize that you never will\n\n\n\n'Cause you were just too busy being fabulous\n\nToo busy to think about us\n\nLookin' for something you'll never find\n\nYou'll never know what you left behind\n\n'Cause you were just too busy being fabulous, uh-huh\n\n\n\nYou tell a joke and everybody's laughin'\n\nThat's something you know how to do\n\nYou've always been the life of the party\n\nBut now my baby, the joke is on you\n\n\n\n'Cause you were just too busy being fabulous\n\nToo busy to think about us\n\nRunning after something that never comes\n\nWhat in the world are you runnin' from?\n\n\n\nAnd you were just too busy being fabulous\n\nToo busy to think about us\n\nTo drink the wine from your winner's cup\n\nTo notice the children were growin' up\n\n\n\nAnd you were just too busy being fabulous\n\nToo busy, too busy\n\nToo busy\n\nAw, baby",
