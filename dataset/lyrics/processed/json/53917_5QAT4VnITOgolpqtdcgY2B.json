  "lyrics": "'Bout time for you to show\r\nStay a while\r\nWe'll have fun pretending you're mine\r\nBut I know your style\r\nIt's getting familiar\n\nThe vision when you come and go\n\nWe're heading for a collision\n\nIt's a glancing blow\n\n\n\nOpen your heart for a minute\n\nBut it snaps back closed, oh\n\nIt's alright, it's alright 'cause\n\nI used to dream we'd last\n\nBeyond the afterglow\n\nBut now I know\n\nYou're just a cameo\n\n\n\nDon't even need to ask\n\nSomewhere you got to go\n\nNow I know\n\nYou're just a cameo\n\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nNow I know you're just a cameo\n\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nNow I know you're just a cameo\n\nIt's not hard\n\nPicking up, babe, where we left off\n\nLift that curtain\n\nBe my guest star till the lights fade\n\nAnd we come apart, oh\n\n\n\nIt's getting familiar\n\nThe feeling when you walk away\n\nDarling I'm done with believing I can make you stay\n\nI'd give you my heart if you'd keep it, but that's a part you'd never play, hey\n\nIt's alright, it's alright 'cause\n\n\n\nI used to dream we'd last beyond the afterglow\n\nBut now I know\n\nYou're just a cameo\n\nDon't even need to ask\n\nSomewhere you got to go\n\nNow I knowYou're just a cameo\n\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nNow I know you're just a cameo\n\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nNow I know you're just a cameo\n\n\n\nJust for a moment\n\nLet's be together\n\nBy now I know you won't stay forever\n\nWon't hold my breath, babe\n\nEach time you disappear\n\nBut let me love you, love you\n\nLet me love you while you're here\n\n\n\nI used to dream we'd last\n\nBeyond the afterglow\n\nBut now I know\n\nYou're just a cameo\n\nDon't even need to ask\n\nSomewhere you got to go\n\nNow I knowYou're just a cameo\n\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nNow I know you're just a cameo\n\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nNow I know you're just a cameo",
