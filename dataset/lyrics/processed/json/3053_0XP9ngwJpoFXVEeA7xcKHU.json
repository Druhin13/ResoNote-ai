  "lyrics": "The dark and distant drumming\r\nThe pounding of the hoops\r\nThe silence of everything that moves\r\nLate in night you see them\r\nDecked out in shiny jewels\r\nThe coming of the caravan of fools\n\n\n\nLike the wings of a dove\n\nThe waiter's white glove\n\nSeem to shimmer by the light of the pool\n\nSome dog-blinding winner\n\nWhen you can't help but lose\n\nYou're running with the caravan of fools\n\n\n\nLove and devotion\n\nDeep as any ocean\n\nDon't play by anybody's rules\n\nWith your carousel of horses\n\nAnd your own foreseen forces\n\nYou're running with the caravan of fools\n\n\n\nCaravan of fools\n\nCaravan of fools\n\nYou're running with the caravan of fools",
