  "lyrics": "Ay one more, my bad\r\nWakin' up inside my bed\r\nLookin' around at all I have\r\nThe only thing missing is what I want\r\nWipe my eyes, then make my bed\n\nBrush my teeth, and fix my hair\n\nWash my face and put that smile on\n\nWhen did being me become so hard?\n\nI've walked so many miles with my head aimed at the ground\n\nI forgot the world and clouds (clouds, clouds, clouds, clouds)\n\nIf I could just look up, I'd see him looking down\n\nI know my grandpa's proud\n\nI am my brother's keeper I'll be right there for my sister\n\nI know it took me some time but I'm the man inside my house\n\nI'm better than I think\n\nI'm stronger than I know\n\nI know I love myself, I love myself (I love myself)\n\nNights like this with love on my mind\n\nI'm dyin' to find it when I open my eyes\n\nI know it's there maybe I'm just wastin' my time\n\nBut it never hurts to try\n\nLovin' every heart except mine\n\nKeeping to myself however I feel inside\n\nI guess I'll just keep tellin' myself that I'm fine\n\nRemember it's all alright (Oh)\n\nAll alright, yeah",
