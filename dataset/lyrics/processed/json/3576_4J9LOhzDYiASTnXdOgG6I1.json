  "lyrics": "Keep staying in my soul\r\nI keep fighting, fighting it\r\nMama said you must be strong\r\nHealing slow, feeling so low\r\nI can't eat, I can't grow\r\nI can't heal my soul\n\n\n\nGod, it's been so long\n\nThere must be some kind of light to come\n\nUnless I go home, lost in oblivion\n\nThere must be some kind of light to come\n\n\n\nLet myself find out there's more\n\nLet my heart find out there's more\n\n\n\nIf there's more\n\nIf there's more\n\n\n\nKeep saying write my songs\n\nI keep crying, crying\n\nLove has taken all of my energy\n\nAnd it's brought up all my melancholy\n\n\n\nI just found I can't breathe\n\nLike they say, like a song\n\nI just found I can't breathe\n\nLike they say, going somewhere",
