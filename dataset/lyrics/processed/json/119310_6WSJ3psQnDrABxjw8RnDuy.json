  "lyrics": "All around me are familiar faces\r\nWorn-out places, worn-out faces\r\nBright and early for their daily races\r\nGoing nowhere, going nowhere\r\nTheir tears are filling up their glasses\r\nNo expression, no expression\n\nHide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow\n\nNo tomorrow, no tomorrow\n\n\n\nAnd I find it kind of funny\n\nI find it kind of sad\n\nThe dreams in which I'm dying\n\nAre the best I've ever had\n\nI find it hard to tell you\n\nI find it hard to take\n\nWhen people run in circles\n\nIt's a very, very\n\nMad world, mad world\n\n\n\nChildren waiting for the day they feel good\n\nHappy birthday, happy birthday\n\nAnd to feel the way that every child should\n\nSit and listen, sit and listen\n\nWent to school and I was very nervous\n\nNo one knew me, no one knew me\n\nHello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson\n\nLook right through me, look right through me\n\n\n\nAnd I find it kind of funny\n\nI find it kind of sad\n\nThe dreams in which I'm dying\n\nAre the best I've ever had\n\nI find it hard to tell you\n\nI find it hard to take\n\nWhen people run in circles\n\nIt's a very very\n\nMad world, mad world\n\nEnlarging your world, mad world",
