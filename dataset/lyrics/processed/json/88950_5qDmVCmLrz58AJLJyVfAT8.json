  "lyrics": "You write her a message\r\nThen you press delete\r\nCalling her up\r\nYou don't wanna speak what you know\r\nYou see her by chance\n\nOut on the street\n\nYou wanna hold her, console her\n\nYou can't find the right way to show\n\n\n\nSo you talk 'bout the weather\n\nYou talk 'bout your shoes\n\nYou're longing forever\n\nTo tell her the truth\n\n\n\nSo don't wait up\n\nGo tell her now\n\nDon't wait around\n\nOr you may never know\n\nYou may never know how she's feeling\n\n(Know how she's feeling)\n\n\n\nMaybe she wants you\n\nMaybe she's shy\n\nMaybe her heart will always be blind to your love\n\n\n\nSo go take the roses\n\nYou left in the sink\n\nStrike all your poses\n\nKnock back a drink\n\n\n\nI said, don't wait up\n\nGo tell her now!\n\nDon't wait around\n\nOr you may never know\n\nYou may never know how she's feeling\n\nDon't wait up\n\nGo tell her now!\n\nDon't wait around\n\nOr you may never know\n\nYou may never know how she's feeling\n\n\n\nYou've been learning all the little parts on the TV\n\nYou've been singing like a bitter star that could have been\n\nSoon you'll be singing in a little bar in Beverley\n\nAll about your broken heart so full of dreams\n\n\n\nOh you're killing me\n\nYou're killing me\n\nKilling me\n\nOh\n\n\n\nDon't wait up\n\nGo tell her now\n\nDon't wait around\n\nI said, don't wait up\n\nGo tell her now\n\nDon't wait around\n\nOr you may never know\n\nYou may never know how she's feeling",
