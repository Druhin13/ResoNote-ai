  "lyrics": "Some people live that selfish desire\r\nSome choose to shout when they speak and that'll be the start\r\nGuarding the flame of those deep in fire\r\nSeeking out those with a voice, one for tomorrow\r\nThey say we've lost our minds\n\nWe've just gained control\n\n\n\nSearch endlessly, fight 'til we're free\n\nFly past the edge of the sea\n\nNo bended knee, no mockery\n\nSomehow we still carry on\n\n\n\nSilence your fear, we've got to move higher\n\nUnlock the stars in the sky guarding us all\n\nBattle the will of those who conspire\n\nTake back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow\n\n\n\nDestroy their perfect crime, watch the power fold\n\n\n\nSearch endlessly, fight 'til we're free\n\nFly past the edge of the sea\n\nNo bended knee, no mockery\n\nSomehow we still carry on\n\n\n\nSearch endlessly, fight 'til we're free\n\nFly past the edge of the sea\n\nNo bended knee, no mockery\n\nSomehow we still carry on\n\nCarry on",
