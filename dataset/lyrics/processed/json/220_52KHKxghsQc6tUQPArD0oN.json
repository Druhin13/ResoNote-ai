  "lyrics": "Every time I try to make sense of our love\r\nIt makes me cry and I see clouds up above\r\nIt ain't no lie, even my best ain't good enough\r\nSo let the feeling flow\r\nWhen you're dressed up very nice\n\nBut you know there's trouble in paradise\n\nWhen you think you got it right\n\nBut your G&T came without the ice\n\nWhen you feel like you're the boss\n\nBut the 9 to 5's too obvious\n\nI ain't complaining, just saying...\n\n\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\nIt can't be perfect every day\n\nCome here with chances of hard rains\n\nThe skies were bluer yesterday\n\nWhen you're screaming and you slam the door\n\nAnd you tell me that you need no more\n\nBetter know it'll all be okay\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\n\n\nIt looks like you'd arrived\n\nAnd I'm soaked through to my brain\n\nBut that's alright\n\nWon't let it drive me insane\n\nTake my advice, coming outside in the pouring rain\n\nAnd let your feelings go\n\n\n\nWhen you're dressed up very nice\n\nBut you know there's trouble in paradise\n\nWhen you think you got it right\n\nBut your G&T came without the ice\n\nWhen you feel like you're the boss\n\nBut the 9 to 5's too obvious\n\nI ain't complaining, just saying...\n\n\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\nIt can't be perfect every day\n\nCome here with chances of hard rains\n\nThe skies were bluer yesterday\n\nWhen you're screaming and you slam the door\n\nAnd you tell me that you need no more\n\nBetter know it'll all be okay\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\n\n\nI don't give a fuck so I'ma gonna strut\n\nWhen the rain falls down\n\nPeople gonna look, and pictures get took\n\nBut I'm alright now\n\nI don't give a fuck so I'ma gonna strut\n\nWhen the rain falls down\n\nPeople gonna look, and pictures get took\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\nOh no no no, we can't be perfect every day\n\n\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\nIt can't be perfect every day\n\nCome here with chances of hard rains\n\nThe skies were bluer yesterday\n\nWhen you're screaming and you slam the door\n\nAnd you tell me that you need no more\n\nBetter know it'll all be okay\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\nWhen you're screaming and you slam the door\n\nAnd you tell me that you need no more\n\nBetter know it'll all be okay\n\nSometimes it rains in LA\n\nSometimes it rains\n\nSometimes it rains in LA",
