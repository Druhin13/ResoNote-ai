You know, no matter who you are or where you're from, we all have the same emotions. You know, we all wanna be successful, you know, we all have the same fears of failure. We all have, you know, um, you know, this... feelings of abandonment. We all, you know, want love\n\n\n\nUh, pardon my sincerity, God just spared me the clarity\n\nThank you to the angels on Earth who loved me to carry me\n\nWhen life decided to bury me\n\nWasn't even safe in my apartment\n\nI came outside, the four officers aimin' to sing it merrily\n\nShiver me timbers, who knew the law could be scared of me\n\nBlack boy fly, watch this black boy\n\nGunshots we all seen it\n\nMy mama crafted imaginary curfews for that very same reason\n\nYoung and guided by dreamin' and somehow I dodged all the precincts\n\nProduct of my environment\n\nSee our beliefs tend to shape the system we place in our minds now\n\nLet's rearrange some of these habits\n\nIn due time we'll make peace with all of our imperfections\n\nBecause this pain can be used to serve as a greater message\n\nSee poverty brought me to understand\n\nThe gift of life is bein' grateful for simply what could have been\n\nI could have been lost in cycles, [?] break you\n\nLeave this place that raised your heart to gain respect and love and grace\n\nI know it takes wantin' more than what's provided on your plate\n\nThe meal is cool for you but what about all your loved ones at stake?\n\nNo lie, guilt trippin' through all the drama\n\nI still got visions that trigger behind the [?] of my father\n\nNo love in the city, but it's love in your heart\n\nA world actin' brave is a mind that can spark change\n\nI've tried and fought, against it all\n\nBut I found out holy acceptance provides the cure",
