  "lyrics": "(Huh)\r\nLonging for your short hair to grow back to the way you like\r\nThank you for the gesture\r\nI regret ever implying that you could be better\r\nDidn't mean to empty your perfect body\r\nAnd fill it with my passing will\n\n\n\nEasily won, weary of losing, gullible girl\n\nWeak and alluring, well we break our rules\n\nGet drunk in the dark\n\nLaughing aloud at the spinning stars\n\n\n\nBelieve me, I'm speaking plainly and painfully\n\nTrying to stay elegant, eloquent and akin to you\n\nI see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched\n\nWaiting for someone to come rip open your chest\n\n\n\nYou take me aside\n\nTo solemnly confide\n\nWhen it comes the time\n\nYou plan to give your body to the flame",
