  "lyrics": "Do you dream about the people that wrong you?\r\nDo you see those faces again and again?\r\nAnd what holy thing has come to possess you?\r\nOr does it all just blend together in your head?\r\nAnd did things work out for you?\n\nOr are you still not sure what that means?\n\nAnd it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink\n\nCause' I can't wash this one clean\n\n\n\nDid you tell all of your friends?\n\nDid you tell all of your friends?\n\nMaybe I could understand\n\nWhat is it about them?\n\nWould they stick around?\n\nWhat is it with them?\n\nAnd would they stick around?\n\n\n\nUp late for six nights in a row\n\nFigures in the dark, oh they move so slow\n\nSleep with the lights on in the hall\n\nAnd you'd leave the door open\n\nIt won't mean a thing at all\n\n\n\nAnd did things work out for you?\n\nOr are you still not sure what that means?\n\nAnd it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink\n\nCause' I can't wash this one clean\n\n\n\nDid you tell all of your friends?\n\nDid you tell all of your friends?\n\nMaybe I could understand\n\nWhat is it about them?\n\nWould they stick around?\n\nWhat is it with them?\n\nAnd would they stick around?\n\nWould they stick around?\n\nWould they stick around?\n\n\n\nIt doesn't matter\n\nThey're up and they're down\n\nAnd I'll bet\n\nThat they're at home\n\nAnd I wouldn't worry\n\nWho's happy alone\n\nEven when it doesn't make sense",
