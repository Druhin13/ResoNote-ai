  "lyrics": "The cab is outside\r\nYou've finished your beer\r\nYou're saying some sweet lines\r\nThat I wanna hear\r\nBut it don't take no Einstein to see that it's clear\r\nYou're gonna break my heart tonight\n\nYou're gonna break my heart tonight\n\n\n\nAnd girl that's alright\n\nIt's black and it's white\n\nAnd if it ain't too much to ask\n\nCould you break it quite fast?\n\n\n\nOh I'm right on the edge\n\nSeeing your clothes on the bed\n\nOh I'll do what I can\n\nTo take it like a man\n\n\n\nThe old taxi driver\n\nLooks down to his feet\n\nThe audience sit there in silence and\n\nHold on to their seats\n\nFor here comes the punchline\n\nSo short and so mean\n\nYou're gonna break my heart tonight\n\nYou're gonna break my heart tonight\n\n\n\nAnd girl that's alright\n\nYou've made up your mind\n\nYou've got too much to swallow\n\nAnd you can't wait till tomorrow\n\n\n\nI'm right on the edge\n\nSeeing our clothes on the bed\n\nI'll do what I can\n\nTo take it like a man",
