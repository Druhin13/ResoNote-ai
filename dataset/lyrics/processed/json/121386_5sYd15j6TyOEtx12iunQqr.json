  "lyrics": "Did you say the thing you wanted?\r\nHave you ever felt in love?\r\nA moment where no problems would ever get you down\r\nFree as an eagle but only for a day (yeah listen)\r\nThe final is a warning, wake up before you go\n\nThere'll be no second chances, that day you're on your own\n\nLet out the feelings, tomorrow may not come\n\n\n\nAll alone in the dark, move the curtains for once\n\nSee the light life has brought, or goodbye forever\n\nTake the arms that embrace, no more being afraid\n\nFeel the sun on your face, or goodbye forever\n\n\n\nWere you listening to the evening?\n\nHave you ever felt the dawn?\n\nWhen everything around you told stories from the world\n\nDear mother nature speaks louder than you know\n\n(oh listen)\n\n\n\nThe final is a warning, Wake up before you go\n\nThere'll be no second chances, that day you're on your own\n\nLet out the feelings tomorrow may not come\n\n\n\nAll alone in the dark, move the curtains for once\n\nSee the light life has brought, or goodbye forever\n\nTake the arms that embrace, no more being afraid\n\nFeel the sun on your face, or goodbye forever\n\n\n\nWe are the birth\n\nWe are the end\n\nWe are the souls\n\nWe have a name\n\nWe are the rising and fallen ones\n\nWe are the spirit forever more",
