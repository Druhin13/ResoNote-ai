  "lyrics": "I'm a simple man, ain't no other way to say it\r\nLay my cards on the table, only way I play it\r\nI got some draw in my yaw, they can't imitate it\r\nTough and rowdy reckless\r\nRough around the edges\n\nEver since you came around I've been\n\nThinking thoughts that I need to get out so I\n\nI grabbed a pen and a napkin and I wrote this down\n\n\n\nMy tractor's green, my pasture's greener\n\nMy tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter\n\nMy road is dirt, your heart is gold\n\nI'm a man of few words but baby here it goes\n\nMy neck is red, my collar's blue\n\nAnd I love you\n\n\n\nYeah, I know it might sound a little elementary\n\nLike a nursery rhyme straight up from the country\n\nIt won't pass for Shakespeare, girl I know it\n\nBut I'ma pour my heart out like a backboard's poet\n\n\n\nMy tractor's green, my pasture's greener\n\nMy tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter\n\nMy road is dirt, your heart is gold\n\nI'm a man of few words but baby here it goes\n\nMy neck is red, my collar's blue\n\nAnd I love you\n\n\n\nYeah, I love your pretty smile\n\nI love your skinny jeans\n\nI love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me\n\nI love your long kiss\n\nAnd I love your long hair\n\nI'm wanna shout it out from the town square\n\nThat I love you\n\nI love you, I love you\n\n\n\nYeah, my tractor's green, my pasture's greener\n\nMy tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter\n\nMy road is dirt, your heart is gold\n\nI'm a man of few words but baby here it goes\n\nMy neck is red, my collar's blue\n\n\n\nYeah, I love your pretty smile\n\nI love your skinny jeans\n\nI love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me\n\nI love your long kiss\n\nAnd I love your long hair\n\nI'm wanna shout it out from the town square\n\nThat I love you\n\nI love you, I love you\n\nYes, I do",
