  "lyrics": "I lost the wind in my sails\r\nThere's a beat in the air\r\nThe current takes me away from you\r\nI've got a map to nowhere\r\nThe tide is high and I'm drifting\r\nDrowning pass its glow\n\nI can't walk on water\n\nBut I can move with the flow\n\n\n\nWill you be my lighthouse?\n\n'Cause you guide my boat today\n\nThey say that I'm a night owl\n\nBut your light turns night to day\n\nWill you be my lighthouse?\n\n'Cause you guide my boat today\n\nThey say that I'm a night owl\n\nBut your light turns night to day\n\n\n\nSunrise on the horizon\n\nHeartbeat back on the shore?\n\nTwilight now, but the city's loud\n\nDon't wanna float any more\n\nThe wind is strong and I'm sailing\n\nGot control of the nine (Control of the nine)\n\nThe sea was rough, but it's calm at last\n\nThe sun is down, but it's bright\n\n\n\nWill you be my lighthouse?\n\n'Cause you guide my boat today\n\nThey say that I'm a night owl\n\nBut your light turns night to day\n\nWill you be my lighthouse?\n\n'Cause you guide my boat today\n\nThey say that I'm a night owl\n\nBut your light turns night to day\n\n\n\nWill you be my lighthouse?\n\n'Cause you guide my boat today\n\nThey say that I'm a night owl\n\nBut your light turns night to day\n\nWill you be my lighthouse? (Oh, won't you be my lighthouse?)\n\n'Cause you guide my boat today (Oh, oh)\n\nThey say that I'm a night owl (Won't you be?)\n\nBut your light turns night to day\n\n\n\nNow won't you be mine?\n\nNow won't you be mine?\n\nNow won't you be mine?\n\nNow won't you be mine?\n\nNow won't you be mine?\n\nNow won't you be mine?\n\nNow won't you be my lighthouse?",
