  "lyrics": "So many eyes, I can't see\r\nI'm static, and I can't move my feet\r\nFrom the moment, that you stood next to me\r\nFeeling manic, I forgot how to speak\r\nAnd there's a rhythm inside\n\nThat I can't slow down\n\nIn this moment in time\n\nNo I won't stop now\n\nGive up, my hand's up\n\nFor love\n\n\n\nAnd there's a rhythm inside\n\nThat I can't slow down\n\nIn this moment in time\n\nNo I won't stop now\n\nGive up, my hands up\n\nFor love\n\n\n\nIt feels like I can be the one for your love\n\nCome, show me what you're feeling\n\nIt feels like I can be the one for your love\n\nCome, show me how you're feeling\n\nCome, show me\n\nCome, show me what you're feeling\n\nCome, show me how you're feeling\n\n\n\nTime, only knows how to heal\n\nFeels like magic, I don't know if this is real, yeah\n\nWhen the lights go out, and my feet don't even wanna touch the ground\n\nI feel the panic, of my world turned upside down\n\n\n\nOh, coz there's a rhythm inside\n\nThat I can't slow down\n\nIn this moment in time\n\nNo I won't stop now\n\nGive up, my hand's up\n\nFor love\n\n\n\nOh, and there's a rhythm inside\n\nThat I can't slow down\n\nIn this moment in time\n\nNo I won't stop now\n\nGive up, my hand's up\n\nFor love\n\n\n\nIt feels like I can be the one for your love\n\nCome, show me what you're feeling\n\nIt feels like I can be the one for your love\n\nCome, show me how you're feeling\n\nOh, come, show me\n\nCome, show me what you're feeling\n\nOh, come, show me how you're feeling",
