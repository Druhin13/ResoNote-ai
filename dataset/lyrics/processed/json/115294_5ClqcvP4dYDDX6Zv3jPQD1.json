  "lyrics": "This could be the last time\r\nThat could be the fault line slipping away\r\nThis could be your last line\r\nCare about everything you say\r\nThis might be the last fight\r\nEvery road could fall right under feet\n\nAnd sink into the ocean\n\nThis will be your lost street\n\n\n\nWhen you open your eyes it's like\n\nNothing's real\n\nWhen you open your eyes it's like\n\n\n\nSaturdays\n\nWhen we dance in the dark in the room\n\nWhere it all gets real\n\nI know you know how it feels\n\nSaturdays\n\nWhen the moonlight lit up your face\n\nAnd that love spark\n\n\n\nTraveled around a bit\n\nMaking my chrome heart say\n\n\"Know what could make me stay?\"\n\n\"Know what could make me sit?\"\n\nMaybe we're a fault line\n\nMaybe we're a fault line ready to break\n\nMaybe you're a time bomb\n\nI don't care what your boyfriend say\n\n\n\nWhen you lift up your head it's like\n\nNothing's real\n\nWhen you open your eyes it's like\n\n\n\nSaturdays\n\nWhen we dance in the dark in the room\n\nWhere it all gets real\n\nI know you know how it feels\n\nSaturdays\n\nWhen we dance in the dark in the room\n\nWhere it all gets real\n\nI know you know how it feels\n\n\n\nDid the good days go away?\n\nIn the bright lights, did it fade?\n\nWe were heavy\n\nWe were sideways\n\nWhen we danced in the dark over my place\n\nIf it's my face you remembered\n\nFrom all the Sundays in the summer\n\nThen you'd know there was so much more than a spark\n\nEnough to make me run and follow you in the dark\n\n\n\nSaturdays (oh)\n\nWhen we dance in the dark in the room (oh)\n\nWhere it all gets real\n\nI know you know how it feels\n\nSaturdays\n\nWhen we dance in the dark in the room\n\nWhere it all gets real\n\nI know you know how it feels\n\nSaturdays\n\nWhen the moonlight lit up your face\n\nAnd that love spark",
