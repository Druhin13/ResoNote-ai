  "lyrics": "And even if the winding turns your roads\r\nEven if your heart leaves you alone\r\nEven if the breaking hits your bones\r\nAnd even if the rain comes pouring down\r\nEven when your scream loses its sound\r\nEven if your wings don't leave the ground\n\n\n\nI'll be here, all for you\n\nI'll be here, all for you\n\n\n\nAnd I'll never break your heart on my love\n\nFollow you through the dark on my love\n\nEven if I do, I don't\n\nEven if I could, I won't\n\nLet you lose who you are\n\nWon't let you fall apart on my love\n\n\n\nAnd even if the years turn old and grey\n\nEven if your legs don't work the same\n\nAnd even if your mind forgets my name\n\nAnd even if the worst takes us through hell\n\nEven if you lose what you once held\n\nEven if you wait but there's no help\n\n\n\nI'll be here, all for you\n\nI'll be here, all for you\n\n\n\nAnd I'll never break your heart on my love\n\nFollow you through the dark on my love\n\nEven if I do, I don't\n\nEven if I could, I won't\n\nLet you lose who you are\n\nWon't let you fall apart on my love\n\n\n\nYou will always be my home\n\nI can never let you go\n\nYou will always be my home\n\nI can never let you go\n\nI'll never break your heart on my love\n\nFollow you through the dark on my love\n\n\n\nAnd I'll never break your heart on my love\n\nFollow you through the dark on my love\n\nEven if I do, I don't\n\nEven if I could, I won't\n\nLet you lose who you are\n\nWon't let you fall apart on my love",
