With a handbag, too? Red or baby blue?\"\n\nShe get to smilin', she ain't used to this 'cause she ain't used to shit\n\nI'm just laughin', coulda been a pimp the way I move my lips\n\nI be speedin', coulda been a driver the way I push the whip\n\nYou a ho, coulda been a bitch the way you throw a fit\n\nBut fuck that, right back to the script ’cause this a major lick\n\nHe got bricks, plus his neck is icy and it match his wrist\n\nNow it’s like six, told her hit his phone, meet her in The Wic\n\nBut he ain't go, but he ain’t that slow, say meet 'em at the store\n\nI'm like cool, let 'em front his move, do what he gon’ do\n\n'Cause this the plot, put 'em in the pot, let it cook like stew\n\nI grab my Glock, it been through a lot, but it still shoot like new\n\nWe at the top, yeah we lost a lot​, but that just how it go\n\nBut check the score, if y'all lose one more, that's 6-24\n\nLet me focus, can't be zoning out, he pullin' up now\n\nHe double parked, he ain't getting out, he in that push to start\n\nThat new Porsche, it's built like a horse, colors like the fourth\n\nHe got a ring, I guess he ain't divorced, wife probably a whore\n\nNow she walk up, she struttin' her stuff, this bitch thick as fuck\n\nGot in the truck, kissed him on his lip, he cuppin' her butt\n\nNow I sneak up, crouching like a tiger, like Snoop off The Wire\n\nBlock on fire, so I take precaution, mask on, Michael Myers\n\nI'm on his ass, he finna be mad, he gon' beat her ass\n\nBut this what happen, I got to the door, I thought I was cappin'\n\nI was lacking, 'cause there go the opps, yellin' out, \"What's crackin'?\"\n\nI'm like, \"What?\" I'm like, \"Nigga who?\" I was born to shoot\n\nI got aim, I'm like Johnny Dang when it comes​ to chains\n\nSo I rise, hit one in his arm, hit one in his thigh, this no lie\n\nBitch it's do or die, you said you gon' slide\n\nYou got some nerve, your shit on the curb, boy we put in work\n\nFrom 64th, and from 65th, we not from 63rd\n\n\n\nBitch we not from 63rd\n\nBitch that's gang, put in work",
