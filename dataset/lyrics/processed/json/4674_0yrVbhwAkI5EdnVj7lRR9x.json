  "lyrics": "Caramelize\r\nYou make me blue\r\nI wanna make a man out of you\r\nThe light in the world is dull\r\nIt’s hard\n\n\n\nLight empties space through the darkness\n\nClose my eyes and they start to sting\n\nFeeling my tear ducts doing their thing\n\n\n\nI’m kinda pretty, that’s why you want it so bad\n\n\n\nWhen the heart gets too tender\n\nReturn it to the sender\n\nBe more centered\n\nIf you miss your friend\n\nCall them again\n\nLast night I got so swept up\n\nMy heart beat was kept up\n\nThat song you gave to me\n\nIs it wrong or meant to be?\n\n\n\nWhen you rolled off way back when\n\nI got this feeling I would never see you again\n\nBut here you are in my bed\n\nHeart gets tender\n\n\n\nThose gaping wide\n\nSecret eyes\n\nClosed on me\n\nThey don’t wanna see\n\n\n\nI want in on the other side\n\nLove your eyelids where you hide\n\nOr further in that neatest dark\n\n\n\nBut my boyish emotion\n\nKeeps me soft like the ocean\n\nAre you relieved when I leave?\n\n\n\nThat I needed to be held\n\nIs a vice like anything else\n\nLet the others push you down\n\nOther vices to make you mad\n\n\n\nI just want to give you strength\n\nHow do you make I’ll leave you think\n\nThe extent to which you’ve grown on me\n\nI can feel now you’ve got a hold on me\n\n\n\nWhen you rolled off way back when\n\nI got this feeling I would never see you again\n\nBut here you are in my bed\n\nHeart gets tender",
