  "lyrics": "There will be no parades for the likes of us\r\nThe wars we fight are doomed to be lost\r\nIâ€™ve seen the reflections of my broken blood\r\nThe callous deception of never giving up\r\nNo stranger to the cause\n\nNo stranger to these wars\n\n\n\nWe dream no more no shock and awe\n\nNowhere to go for rock and roll\n\nA blue screen for a tribal heart\n\nThe sequels of forgotten wars\n\n\n\nI twist and I turn towards apocalypse\n\nI pose for effect before your deadly kiss\n\nEcho echo in a chamber of purity\n\nTo a lip-synced moral maze soliloquy\n\n\n\nNo stranger to this cause\n\nStill a stranger in these parts\n\n\n\nProgressive thoughts for idle hands\n\nPlatforms for corrupted friends\n\nA blue screen for a tribal heart\n\nThe sequels of forgotten wars\n\n\n\nNo medication left to take\n\nJust defeat and the bitterest of tastes\n\nA blue screen for a drama whore\n\nThe sequels of forgotten wars",
