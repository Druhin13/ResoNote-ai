  "lyrics": "She wants the moon, I get a rope\r\nAnd Pull it closer to her window\r\nIf she wants a skyline, I give her New York,\r\nIf she wants Paris, I get a passport\r\nIf she wants some wine from California,\n\nI get in my car and I drive her all the way there\n\nI don't care, anytime anything anywhere...\n\n\n\nAll she's got to do is ask me, ask me,\n\nBat those lashes and look at me look at me,\n\nOne little kiss is enough to convince me,\n\nShe gets what she wants\n\n\n\nAround her fingers she wraps me wraps me,\n\nAnd all I want to to do is make her happy,\n\nThere's always a \"Oh hell yeah\" when she turns it on,\n\nShe gets what she wants...\n\n\n\nA little wink, a little smile,\n\nShe wants a inch, she gets a mile,\n\nI'll come running when she calls,\n\nYeah she's worth it, and she's worth it all\n\n\n\nAll she's got to do is ask me, ask me,\n\nBat those lashes and look at me look at me,\n\nOne little kiss is enough to convince me,\n\nShe gets what she wants\n\n\n\nAround her fingers she wraps me wraps me,\n\nAnd all I want to to do is make her happy,\n\nThere's always a \"Oh hell yeah\" when she turns it on,\n\nShe gets, she gets what she wants...\n\n\n\nI don't mind when she gets her way,\n\n'Cause when she gets her way I get mine...\n\n\n\nAll she's got to do is ask me, ask me,\n\nBat those lashes and look at me look at me,\n\nOne little kiss is enough to convince me,\n\nShe gets what she wants\n\n\n\nAround her fingers she wraps me wraps me,\n\nAnd all I want to to do is make her happy,\n\nThere's always a \"Oh hell yeah\" when she turns it on,\n\nYeah she gets what she wants\n\nShe gets she gets what she wants",
