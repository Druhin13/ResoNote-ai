  "lyrics": "On the way to your brother's house in the valley, dear,\r\nBy the river bridge a cradle floating beside me.\r\nIn the whitest water on the banks against the stone\r\nYou will lift his body from the shore and bring him home\r\nOliver James washed in the rain no longer\n\nOliver James washed in the rain no longer\n\n\n\nOn the kitchen table that your grandfather did make\n\nYou and your delicate way will slowly clean his faith\n\nAnd you will remember when you rehearsed the actions of\n\nA innocent and anxious mother full of anxious love\n\n\n\nOliver James washed in the rain no longer\n\nOliver James washed in the rain no longer\n\n\n\nWalk with me down Ruby beach and through the valley floor\n\nLove for the one you know more\n\nLove for the one you know more\n\n\n\nBack we go to your brother's house emptier my dear\n\nThe sound of ancient voices ringing soft upon your ear\n\n\n\nOliver James washed in the rain no longer\n\nOliver James washed in the rain no longer",
