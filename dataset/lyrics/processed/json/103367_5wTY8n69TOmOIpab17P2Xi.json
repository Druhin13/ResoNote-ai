That's what's cool now, right?\r\nIf I wasn't thin and white with blue hair would I be here\r\nMaybe if I kill myself you'll know I'm sincere\r\nI'll shave my blue hair\n\nBurn the rest of two dares\n\nDrop from 'parks\n\nLike \"fuck it, who cares?\"\n\nBut I'll tell you:\n\n\n\nI resent the party scene\n\nWith part of me that's hard to see\n\nIt's turned my starry friends\n\nTo uninspired's lacking symmetry\n\n\n\nHey, look what you've done now\n\nI'm fucked and hope you're proud\n\nWhile you follow around, follow around\n\n\n\nHey, look what you've done now\n\nI'm fucked and hope you're proud\n\nWhile you follow around, follow around\n\n\n\nSo, excuse my tantrum\n\nCan't you see I've got my hands full?\n\n\n\nI'm getting texts from idols I've looked up to since 15\n\nBut now people use my friends to try to get to me, (Fuck you)\n\nBut we don't know you, you don't know we\n\nWe're freaked out and fragile\n\nIt's become more than a hassle\n\nBut I'll tell you\n\n\n\nI resent the party scene\n\nWith part of me that's hard to see\n\nIt's turned my starry friends\n\nTo uninspired's lacking symmetry\n\n\n\nHey, look what you've done now\n\nI'm fucked and hope you're proud\n\nWhile you follow around, follow around\n\n\n\nHey, look what you've done now\n\nI'm fucked and hope you're proud\n\nWhile you follow around, follow around\n\n\n\nLoud gets lonely\n\nLoud gets lonely\n\nLoud gets lonely\n\n\n\nBut I've just a couple more things to say really quick\n\n\n\nTo a certain married mister\n\nThat tried to move on my misses (Cam)\n\nTry to come around again\n\nYou'll catch some swings and no misses\n\nAnd to the rest\n\nI'll keep them nameless\n\n-nah fuck it, here we go:\n\n\n\nIt's Richard and Clayton\n\nAnd John-shit Will, yeah, y'all made it\n\nAnd if I see you in person\n\nI'm taking teeth\n\nTrust, you've earned this\n\n\n\nThank you for coming by, today was a really good day",
