  "lyrics": "What a joy it is to stand in Christ forgiven\r\nRighteousness and eternal life when salvation is given\r\nAll my sins paid for and I could never repay You\r\nBut now my greatest delight is to trust you and obey you\r\nMore than a genre of music, worship is a heart change\r\nI gladly bow my knee to the God who never changes\n\nEvery day I'm changing, becoming more like Christ\n\nAdoring what is good, adorned with the fruits of new life\n\nAnd my hope is not a fantasy, it's built upon a reality\n\nThat you will keep your promises according to your sovereignty\n\nI will see your face and be safe under your reign\n\nWhen my faith turns to sight and only perfect love remains\n\nYour people are my people no matter where they come from\n\nThe church exists according to the works of God's Son\n\nSo when the new creation when we're gathered in His name\n\nIt will be obvious that He's the one that's worthy of all fame\n\nCause the worthiness of Jesus is the reason we belong\n\nSo Worthy is the Lamb will forever be our song\n\n\n\nWisdom, Power & Praise\n\nGlory, Honor & Strength\n\nWorthy!\n\nTo the Lamb who was slain\n\nBe Wisdom, Power & Praise\n\nForever!\n\nAnd to the King on the throne\n\nBe Glory, Honor & Strength\n\nYou are worthy!\n\n\n\nThere is a space between us, it's a right divide\n\nDistance between the depths of your worthiness and mine\n\nMine is derived, all my worthiness comes from thine\n\nI am merely a man, all thy works divine\n\nI abide only as a branch attached to the vine\n\nThat grows the beautiful fruit that gets crushed into wine\n\nI am the least deserving made worthy to touch His feet\n\nThe serpent that did nothing to earn a seat at the wedding feast\n\nI'm a created being, You created everything\n\nYou make footstools of fools and galaxies your rings\n\nYou are Christ the Consummate, my hope and every confidence\n\nWorthy to receive praise from every mouth and every continent\n\nInfinitely worthy of loyalty and my allegiance\n\nWorthy enough to die to self, to offer my obedience\n\nWorthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Son of Man\n\nWorthy is the One who takes the scrolls from His holy hand\n\nWhere angels and elders and living creatures all fall\n\nAnd worship the highest King, the most worthy of all\n\n\n\nWisdom, Power & Praise\n\nGlory, Honor & Strength\n\nWorthy!\n\nTo the Lamb who was slain\n\nBe Wisdom, Power & Praise\n\nForever!\n\nAnd to the King on the throne\n\nBe Glory, Honor & Strength\n\nYou are worthy!",
