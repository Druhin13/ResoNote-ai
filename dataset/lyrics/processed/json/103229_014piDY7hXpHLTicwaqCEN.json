  "lyrics": "Bound for trouble from the start\r\nI've been walking through this old world\r\nIn the dark\r\nAll alone, right by my side\r\nThere you were shining\r\nMy ray of light\n\n\n\nSo I'll sing lover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\nWon't you ever come back\n\nEver come back to me\n\nHow could I have been so foolish to let you leave?\n\nLover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\n\n\nI'll never be as good as I'd like to be\n\nEternally restless with reason to believe\n\nBut I think that we missed our connection\n\nOnly to feel your affection\n\nUntil my final days\n\n\n\nI'll sing lover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\nWon't you ever come back\n\nEver come back to me\n\nHow could I have been so foolish to let you leave?\n\nLover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\n\n\nI am warm enough\n\nYet I still shiver\n\nI am fed, but still I starve\n\nYou know me, I am the greatness giver\n\nAlways waiting on the clouds to part\n\n\n\nI'll sing lover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\nWon't you ever come back\n\nEver come back to me\n\nHow could I have been so foolish to let you leave?\n\nSo. lover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\n\n\nLover come back\n\nLover come back to me\n\nWon't you ever come back\n\nEver come back to me\n\nHow could I have been so foolish to let you leave?\n\nSo. lover come back\n\nLover come back to me",
