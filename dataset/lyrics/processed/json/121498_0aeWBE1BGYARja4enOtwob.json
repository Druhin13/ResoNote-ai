  "lyrics": "16 Dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day\r\nI see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with\r\nDick Brave \"Walk This Way\".\r\nI need a quick drink more volume for the beat\r\nI see the cats are playing dice\n\nIt's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money\n\nTo a fat lady singing boogie woogie chili honey\n\n\n\nI've been walking the streets again\n\nBut it's the same old thing I'll do it again\n\nJust to the what the day will bring\n\nBut it's the same old song I'll do it again\n\n\n\nI'll bring you home my baby I will\n\nI would love to bring you home\n\nI would love to bring you home\n\nI would love to bring you home\n\n\n\n16 hours on my back in a corner and an empty bottle of Jack and a bitch\n\nWell I'm sorry to inform you that the poison in my body guiding you\n\nTo walk away from this mess\n\nI need a quick drink more volume for the beat\n\nI see the cats are playing dice",
