Other than me (nobody)\nShit, what would I do if I was you? (no clue)\nMan, where'd I come from? Where do I go?\nMirror, mirror on the wall, let a nigga know\nCause\n\nI can't see myself, I can't see myself\nWhen I close my eyes, then I free myself\nNo matter where I'm at, I just be myself yeah, yeah\n(Come find me) I can't see myself, I can't see myself\nWhen I'm all alone (I just wanna feel loved)\nI don't need no help, I believe myself (yeah)\n\nSmokin' and drinkin' all by myself\nHopin' and wishin' I find myself (come find me)\nLord willin' we won't die tonight, we gon' fly tonight\n\nYeah\nOkay I'm sittin' here, tryin' think of the exact words for me to explain to you\nThat it is what it is and that's what it's gon' be\nAin't no changin' me (nope)\nAin't no maybes and no probablys, I gotta be (myself)\nThat's what it has to be, I'm happily, gladly, gradually\nChangin' reality for my family\nThey proud of me\nCould've, never imagined or fathomed things that had happend\n\nThe good, the bad, and the tragic\nThe happy moments, the sad ones, the classics\nMy first time in Miami\nPharrell had me out on Collins Ave\nThe studio rappin'\nThe last nigga signed to Star Trak, might get that shit tatted\nAnd then we shriveled up the contract, and still keep in contact\nWe beyond all that bullshit and that nonsense\nAnd besides that\nI ain't gettin' that time back\nNiggas know where my heart's at\nI just gotta move on, shit\nGotta get my own, shit\nSo I pray with all my might\nI walk by faith, and not by sight\nBecause\n\n\nI can't see myself, I can't see myself, yeah\nI can't see myself, I can't see myself\nWhen I close my eyes, then I free myself",
