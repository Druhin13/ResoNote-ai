  "lyrics": "I have faith enough to know the end is nothing but a new beginning\r\nHere today and gone tomorrow and the world will just continue spinning\r\nI could try to leave behind the kind of legacy they might diminish\r\nOr I could fight and die for human kind and I'm not finished yet\r\nThough my flesh might fade to dust\r\nWill my heart be changed to gold\n\nWell I guess we'll never know until we know\n\n\n\nAnd if there's a heaven\n\nI know the angels gotta be listening\n\nSomebody tell them\n\nThat there's something we've gotta be missing\n\nI don't know if I'll see my tomorrow\n\nIf I do lord take my soul\n\nAnd when I get in\n\nI promise to send out a message from heaven\n\n\n\nI'm convinced this complicated game of life is just a simple riddle\n\nThe answer isn't do or die or wrong or right it's hiding in the middle\n\nI will fight to stay alive just like a candle burning in the window\n\nI'm told when it's your time to go you'll know but I'm not finished yet\n\nWhen my breath turns into air\n\nWill my story still be told\n\nWell I guess we'll never know until we know\n\n\n\nAnd if there's a heaven\n\nI know the angels gotta be listening\n\nSomebody tell them\n\nThat there's something we've gotta be missing\n\nI don't know if I see my tomorrow\n\nIf I do lord take my soul\n\nAnd when I get in\n\nI promise to send out a message from heaven\n\n\n\nAnd I know that change won't come easy\n\nBut I'm gonna roar till they hear me\n\nCause hiding in silence would kill me either way\n\nAfter the rain and the thunder\n\nAfter the pain still ain't over\n\nWe'll learn to love one another, I pray\n\n\n\nAnd if there's a heaven\n\nI know the angels gotta be listening\n\nSomebody tell them\n\nThat there's something we've gotta be missing\n\nI don't know if I'll see my tomorrow\n\nIf I do lord take my soul\n\nAnd when I get in\n\nI promise to send out a message from heaven",
