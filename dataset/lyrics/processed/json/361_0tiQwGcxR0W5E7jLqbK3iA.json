  "lyrics": "I could've sworn, I saw fireworks\r\nFrom your house, last night\r\nAs the lights flickered and they failed\r\nI had it all figured out\r\nWhy do I do this to myself every time\n\nI know the way it ends\n\nBefore it's even begun\n\nI am the only one\n\nAt the finish line\n\n\n\nI took a trip out to the frozen lake\n\nAnd it felt so far away\n\nBut I could feel it washing over me\n\nThere's no escaping, the harsh light of day\n\n\n\nWhy do I do this to myself every time\n\nI know the way it ends\n\nBefore it's even begun\n\nI am the only one\n\nAt the finish line\n\n\n\nSit out on that beach in Chicago\n\nWoke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue\n\nWherever I went\n\nI always knew, always knew\n\nTill I didn't know\n\n\n\nWhy do I do this to myself every time\n\nI know the way it ends\n\nBefore it's even begun\n\nI am the only one\n\nAt the finish line\n\n\n\nI could've sworn, I saw fireworks\n\nFrom your house, last night",
