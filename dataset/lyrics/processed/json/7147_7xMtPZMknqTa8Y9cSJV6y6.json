  "lyrics": "We combined\r\nThe first time that we lost our minds\r\nWe couldn't see how far we'd climbed\r\nWithout looking down\r\nUsed to think\r\nThe worst thing we could do is sink\n\nYou took me right up to the brink\n\nAnd swore you'd stick around\n\nChange the tide\n\nThere is consequences when you lie\n\nThe truth will come out in your eyes\n\nWith all the fear I've found\n\n\n\nAnd who could break you\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you down\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you down\n\n\n\nWay back when\n\nI started wondering where you've been\n\nChange the way our story ends\n\nAnd what you meant to me\n\nDifferent tune\n\nIt's simple when I think of you\n\nSo thank you for the damn good view\n\nAppreciate the key\n\n\n\nAnd who could break you\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you down\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you down\n\n\n\nIf I say that you're freaking me out\n\nSaving face I don't want you around\n\nYou got a hold on me, ooh\n\nIf I fall cause you're breaking me down\n\nWho would have thought it was you all along\n\nYou got a hold on me\n\n\n\nAnd who could break you\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you down\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you\n\nWho could break you down",
