  "lyrics": "Lately I've been thinking about the past\r\nHow there is no holding back\r\nNo point in wasting sorrow\r\nOn things that won't be here tomorrow\r\nBut you and I well we don't need to speak\n\nIt's the secret that we keep\n\nOut of view and out of sight\n\nJust say when and we'll say goodnight\n\n\n\nTell me it's okay\n\nTo live life this way\n\nSometimes I want you to stay\n\nI know it's a shame\n\n\n\nNow I have spent so much of my time\n\nGoing out of my mind\n\nTrying so hard to be of use\n\nBut what you cannot gain you lose\n\n\n\nIn LA, the sun's almost too bright\n\nI cannot get it right\n\nThe emptiness I feel\n\nAnd now none of it seems real\n\n\n\nSo maybe it's alright\n\nIf I just spend the night\n\nSometimes I just can't bear to walk away\n\nI know it's a shame\n\n\n\nWho have I become\n\nWho will I be\n\nCome tomorrow\n\n\n\nTell me it's okay\n\nIf I ask you to stay\n\nSometimes the night cuts through me like a knife\n\nI know it's a shame",
