These lips, can't wait to taste your skin, baby (No, no)
And these eyes, I can't wait to see your grin, (Ooh ooh baby)

And you gotta know, you gotta know
You know that I adore you (Yeah baby)
Baby these fists, will always protect ya, lady
And this mind, ooh will never neglect you, (Yeah baby, ooh baby)
