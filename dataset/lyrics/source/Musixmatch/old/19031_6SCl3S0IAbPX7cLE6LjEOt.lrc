Ships in the making
Bound for a distant shore
World for the taking
Men gone forever more
Boarding and setting sail
Yet victory won't prevail
Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
(Leap to land on higher ground) higher, higher
Call it surrender
Still won't feel like defeat
Men laying down their swords
Each of their own accord
Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground
Raise the banner to the sky
Face the fear and hold your head up high
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Take the leap like you are bound for higher ground
(Let this take you higher) higher, higher
Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Freeze the arrow in the air
Make your mark and leave it hanging there
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap to land on higher ground yeah-oh
Be the first to turn around
Take the leap and land on higher ground
