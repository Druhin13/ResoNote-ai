And you can say I was unkind
You can talk me down, I don't mind
But when I had you hung on the line
Didn't seem you had it on your mind
On the line
On the line
♪
And you can tear my woman down
Get around, I don't mind
When we both were caught on the line
We got around all of the time
All the time
On the line
♪
On the, on the line
On the, on the line
On the, on the line
On the, on the line
