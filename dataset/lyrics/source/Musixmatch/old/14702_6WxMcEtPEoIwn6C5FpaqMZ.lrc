Rise with the morning
You call to me
My thoughts are crawling
You're all I see
I wish I could live without you
But you're a part of me
Wherever I go
You'll always be next to me

Fall into the night
As I gaze into you
Shine so bright
It's all I do
I wish I could live without you
But you're a part of me
Wherever I go
You'll always be next to me

You'll always be next to me

You'll always be next to me

You'll always be next to me

You'll always be next to me
