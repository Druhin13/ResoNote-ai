You can break down my lights and my doors
But I won't let you back in no more, no more
I'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again
â™ª
Five nights, it shouldn't seem so long
But it takes forever when you go all about it wrong
These halls are lined with blood I can't have on my hands
These walls, they seem to call my name
But I refuse to be another puppet in your game
And your eyes are dead inside, but tonight, I leave alive
You can break down my lights and my doors
But I won't let you back in no more, no more
I'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again
Tie me up, put me into a suit
But I'll never ever be like you, no
I know what happened here, and you can't erase your past
Done what I can to try to hide
But even you can tell who I really am inside
And it's not my job to watch you
I'm leaving here tonight
But maybe one day you will find humanity
Until then, don't you dare say that we are the same
You can break down my lights and my doors
But I won't let you back in no more, no more
I'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again
Tie me up, put me into a suit
But I'll never ever be like you, no
And I know what happened here, and you can't erase your past
And I crave the light of day
'Cause I've been keeping you away
It's driving me insane
It's driving me insane
You can break down my lights and my doors
But I won't let you back in no more, no more
I'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again
Tie me up, put me into a suit
But I'll never ever be like you, no
And I know what happened here, and you can't erase your past
Maybe one day you'll find humanity
