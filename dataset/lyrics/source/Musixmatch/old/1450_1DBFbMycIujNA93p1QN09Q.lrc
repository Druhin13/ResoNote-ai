Before we get started it I'll clean this up
No use drinking from a leaking cup
You know what I mean?
Not really, it seems
And when we get going, we'll keep it saying
Changes as good as a holiday
I'm not claiming I'm some patron saint

Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what I got I give it all away
♪
Walkin' on eggshells gets tiring and
Pulling teeth, white-knuckling
And I don't wanna hurt your feelings
So I say nothing
A sort of self-righteous, my heart of gold
Just sit back, do what you're told
If you spot it, you got it
Well, maybe I got it too

Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what I got I give it all away
♪
And it goes
And it goes
Yeah, it goes away
Say what you need to...
Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what I got I give it all away

Say what you want, don't got a lot
All of what you got you throw it all away
