We are both young
We both young in mind
So it's better to keep in on the easy side
We like to go out
Almost every night
Looking for something bad
Looking for some to feel
I would have been down
Just for the night with you
But your made me believe
This is something real, real
I thought & know you, you, you
But it wasn't all true, true, true
Don't waste your time reminiscing what we had
'Cause this is the last time you
Hear from me
I know about you
I know that L.A. life
But I still thought
I thought that you'd be mine
Walking on here
Walk on a real thin line
Looking for something good
Looking for some to heal
I would have been down
Just for the night with you
But you made me believe
This is something real, real
I thought & know you, you, you
But it wasn't all true, true, true
Don't waste your time reminiscing what we had
'Cause this is the last time you
Hear from me
I would have been down
Just for the night with you
But you made me believe
This is something real, real
I thought & know you, you, you
But it wasn't all true, true, true
Don't waste your time reminiscing what we had
'Cause this is the last time you
Hear from me
