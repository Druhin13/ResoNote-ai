  "lyrics": "Leave the spoon-fed champions\r\nLeave the lamp lit prose\r\nLeave the endlessly distracting matinées\r\nAnd say hello\r\nHello\r\nHello\r\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\r\nI don't know why it's been so long\r\nAlone, imagining nobody\r\nOnce in a while, well\r\nI guess the planets align\r\nAnd show me the one I am\r\nI am the one who would love you\r\nSeek the dusty longshot\r\nOn the last frontier\r\nJoin the minor miracle that looks flat\r\nBut reveals itself a sphere\r\nAs the wheel of inception steers\r\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\r\nI don't know why it's been so long\r\nAlone, imagining nobody\r\nOnce in a while, well\r\nI guess the planets align\r\nAnd show me the one I am\r\nI am the one who would love you\r\nThey say it's ashes to ashes\r\nPassion is passing\r\nAnd we all will die alone (Wow)\r\nBut while we're here on the planet\r\nDancing on granite\r\nWhy don't we drink Côtes du Rhône (Wow)?\r\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\r\nI don't know why it's been so long\r\nAlone, imagining nobody\r\nOnce in a while, well\r\nI guess the planets align\r\nAnd show me the one I am\r\nI am the one who would love you\r\nWhat is the time when I can call you by your name?\r\nI don't know why it's been so long\r\nAlone, imagining nobody\r\nOnce in a while, well\r\nI guess the planets align\r\nAnd show me the one I am\r\nI am the one who would love you"
