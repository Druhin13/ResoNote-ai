  "lyrics": "Well, the Devil went down to Georgia\r\nHe was lookin' for a soul to steal\r\nHe was in a bind 'cause he was way behind\r\nAnd he was willing to make a deal\r\nWhen he came across this young man\r\nSawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot\r\nAnd the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump\r\nAnd said \"Boy, let me tell you what\"\r\n\"You probably didn't even know it, but I am a fiddle player too\r\nAnd if you'd care to take a dare, I'll just make a bet with you\r\nNow you're playin' pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due\r\nI'll bet a fiddle o' gold against your soul, I think I'm better than you\"\r\nThe boy said, \"My name's Johnny and it might be a sin\r\nBut I'm gon' take your bet and you're gonna regret\r\nI'm the best there's ever been\"\r\nJohnny, rosin' up your bow and play your fiddle hard\r\n'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards\r\nAnd if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold\r\nBut if you lose, the Devil gets your soul\r\n♪\r\nThe Devil opened up his case and he said, \"I'll start this show\"\r\nAnd fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow\r\nAnd then he pulled his bow across the strings and it made a evil hiss\r\nAnd then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this\r\n♪\r\nWhen the Devil finished, Johnny said\r\n\"You know, you're pretty good ol' son\r\nBut you just flop down in that chair right there\r\nI'm gon' show you how this stuff's done\"\r\nFire on the mountain, run, boys, run\r\nThe Devil's in the house of the risin' sun\r\nThe chicken in the bread-pan pickin' out dough\r\nGranny, does your dog bite? No, child, no\r\n♪\r\nWell, that ol' Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat\r\nAnd he laid that golden fiddle down on the ground at Johnny's feet\r\nJohnny said, \"Devil, come on back if you ever wanna try again\r\nI done told you once, you son of a gun, I'm the best there's ever been\"\r\nAnd he played\r\nFire on the mountain, run, boys, run\r\nThe Devil's in the house of the risin' sun\r\nThe chicken in the bread-pan pickin' out dough\r\nGranny, does your dog bite? No, child, no"
