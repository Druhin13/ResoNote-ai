  "lyrics": "I heard it's cold in New York\r\nSo bring your coat\r\nCherry, your body\r\nI'll cherish every word that chokes up in your throat\r\nBaby, you look like diamond skies\r\nYour collarbone's Orion's belt\r\nI'll think of this night\r\nWhen I'm missing California down in Chinatown\r\nI wonder if you still think of me at all\r\nBut you were never one to think much\r\nYou're swimming in his t-shirt\r\nAnd I'm still swimming in your touch\r\nThough you're with another guy\r\nHaving the time of your life\r\nI'll keep this prom night in my mind\r\nSo we dance when I close my eyes\r\nCan you feel it inside your bones?\r\nCan you hear mine break through the phone?\r\nYou stroll the streets like a ghost\r\nHiding in that overcoat\r\nI should have never told you\r\nIt's cold in New York\r\nAnd I wonder if you still think of me at all\r\nBut you were never one to think much\r\nYou're swimming in his t-shirt\r\nAnd I'm still swimming in your touch\r\nI know I need to let go\r\nI'm holding onto the west coast Baby,\r\nI'm cursed by the sea\r\nAnd California's haunting me"
