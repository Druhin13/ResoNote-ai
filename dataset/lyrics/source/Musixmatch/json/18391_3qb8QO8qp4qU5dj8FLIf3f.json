  "lyrics": "The moment heaven's King, took His final breath\r\nDarkness roared and heaven wept\r\nBut hope was held, in nail-pierced hands\r\nEven death, was not the end\r\nNow we see\r\nHe changed, everything\r\nThis is the moment\r\nHere is the moment\r\nWe've been, waiting for\r\nThis is the moment\r\nHere is the moment\r\nWe've been, waiting for\r\nThere in the silent tomb, the Savior drew a breath\r\nHeaven roared and darkness fled\r\nCreation shook, the stone was rolled away\r\nThe love of God, overcame the grave\r\nNow we see\r\nHe changed, everything\r\nFrom death to life\r\nHe set us free\r\nThis is the moment\r\nHere is the moment\r\nWe've been, waiting for\r\nThis is the moment\r\nHere is the moment\r\nWe've been, waiting for\r\nThe crown of thorns worn upon His brow\r\nThe heavy cross where blood poured down\r\nMercy flowed from sinless hands\r\nBehold the King, the great I Am\r\nHe's reaching out in grace and truth\r\nThe Son of God making all things new\r\nLove bursting forth from a conquered grave\r\nHe is alive, Jesus reigns\r\nThis is the moment\r\nHere is the moment\r\nWe've been, waiting for\r\nThis is the moment\r\nHere is the moment\r\nWe've been, waiting for"
