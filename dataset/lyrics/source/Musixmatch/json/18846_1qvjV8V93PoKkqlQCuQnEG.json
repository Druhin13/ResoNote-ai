  "lyrics": "Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens\r\nBright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens\r\nBrown paper packages tied up with strings\r\nThese are a few of my favorite things\r\n♪\r\nCream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels\r\nDoorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles\r\nWild geese that fly with the moon on their wings\r\nThese are a few of my favorite things\r\n♪\r\nGirls in white dresses with blue satin sashes\r\nSnowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes\r\nSilver-white winters that melt into springs\r\nThese are a few of my favorite things\r\nWhen the dog bites\r\nWhen the bee stings\r\nWhen I'm feeling sad\r\nI simply remember my favorite things\r\nAnd then I don't feel so bad"
