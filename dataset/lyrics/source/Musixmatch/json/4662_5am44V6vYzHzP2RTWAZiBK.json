  "lyrics": "Here and then you're gone\r\nYeah Houston love song\r\nUsed to run around\r\nWith the vampires uptown\r\nBut I've seen them fade\r\nAnd I got to get away\r\nIn the years to come you know that\r\nHouston loved me wrong\r\nPicture Saint Denis\r\nPut his arms around me\r\nMy baby, don't lie\r\nMy baby, so true\r\nArm in arm\r\nWith Houston thug\r\nKeep it low to the ground, now\r\nAs you get to know the town\r\nCutie's mind is on fire\r\nShe had a spiritual good time\r\nShe's never been a good student\r\nBut she's cute\r\nMy baby, don't lie\r\nDon't you know I'm in the mood\r\nGonna do it to you\r\nYeah you made it through December\r\nAnd I really look up to you\r\nKeep cool and calm\r\nKeep it going until it's done\r\nDrove on for Point Judith\r\nDrove his car through the city\r\nWell, what can you do\r\nWhen every thought you had was untrue\r\nBeen dreaming too long\r\nFell under the snow cloud\r\nPowerful two-chord blues\r\nComing through from me to you\r\nMaybe this is all\r\nLet's keep it short and sweet\r\nKeeping my brights on\r\nWe got miles to go"
