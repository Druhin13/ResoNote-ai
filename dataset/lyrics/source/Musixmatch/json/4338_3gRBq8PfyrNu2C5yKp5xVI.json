  "lyrics": "I know it's a little old-fashioned\r\nHolding hands, now start your romancin'\r\nShow me all your flaws\r\nShow me your bear claws\r\nGo rip your heart out tonight\r\nYou don't have to be cool to make me shiver\r\nLook in my eyes, can I make this any clearer?\r\nJust a late-night girl, calling through a phone\r\nShe never really loved you so just leave her alone\r\nYour mama says it's over when you come through the door\r\nSaying \"That's enough of you now, won't you shut your mouth?\"\r\nAy! Oh!\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nAy! Oh!\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nYou say goodbye as if you're leaving on a plane\r\nYou've seen the clouds and how the shapes are so strange\r\nAnd not the boy in the backseat, staying in the backseat\r\nTryin' to make sense of it all\r\nHe's saying, \"We were such a good thing, we were such a good thing\r\nHow could you let this fall?\"\r\nTake all my money and meet me on the sidewalk\r\nIf you don't show then I'll know\r\nJust a late-night girl, calling through a phone\r\nShe never really loved you so just leave her alone\r\nYour mama says it's over when you come through the door\r\nSaying \"That's enough of you now won't you shut your mouth?\"\r\nAy! Oh!\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nAy! Oh!\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nâ™ª\r\nShow me all your flaws, show me your bear claws\r\nGo rip your heart out tonight\r\nYou were just a late-night girl, calling through a phone\r\nShe never really loved you so just leave her alone\r\nYour mama says it's over when you come through the door\r\nSaying \"That's enough of you now won't you shut your mouth?\"\r\n\"That's enough of you, kid, now you're going South, love\"\r\nAy! Oh!\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nAy! Oh!\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nAy! Oh! (Show me all your flaws)\r\nI'll never let you go\r\nAy! Oh! (Show me all your flaws)\r\nI'll never let you go"
