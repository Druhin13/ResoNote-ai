  "lyrics": "Heaven's making rent\r\nThere's a vacancy for me and all my friends\r\nThe end of days are on the way\r\nWho needs eulogies\r\nWhen you've got your loved ones, and everyone's depressed?\r\nParty in the morgue tonight\r\nEverything's gonna be alright\r\nAnd we'll be singing\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nAnd we better get it\r\nWe'll be screaming\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nAnd we'll show up missing\r\nDeadbeats on parade\r\nGonna bite the bullet, and jump on the grenade\r\nFuck the world, it's judgement day\r\nWe got thoughts and prayers\r\nNothing comes of mine, and I don't even care\r\nI'm gonna take it to the mausoleum\r\nAnd we're all going to be screaming\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nNow we better get it\r\nWe'll be screaming\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nAnd we're going missing!\r\nOne finger on the trigger, and one on the stereo\r\nI think you're killing me with kindness\r\nGunslinger dead ringer and Michelangelo\r\nI'm in stitches blowing kisses, and a death wish\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nNow we better get it\r\nWe'll be screaming\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nAnd we're going missing\r\nSinging\r\n\"Kill your friends!\"\r\nAnd we're going to get it\r\nWe'll be singing\r\n\"Kill your friends!\""
