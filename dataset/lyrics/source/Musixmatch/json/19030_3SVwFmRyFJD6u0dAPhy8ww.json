  "lyrics": "Can we stay awake and lay the day to waste, forsake these bones?\r\nHopelessly abandoning our phones to watch the clouds awake over the homes\r\nOf people we won't ever know\r\n'Cause nothing is bigger and brighter than this\r\nYeah, I couldn't tell you that we won't exist\r\nAnd here is the last dance, trying to admit, that I should let you go\r\nLove, don't feel it could last forever\r\nLove, I'm ready to let you know\r\nLove, don't feel it could last forever\r\nLove, I'm ready to let you go\r\nCan we stay alight, reignite these embers just for one more night?\r\nNever to grow old, if we just frame it right\r\nSo much for foresight in this\r\nLast dance, trying to admit that I should let this go\r\nLove, don't feel it could last forever\r\nLove, I'm ready to let you know\r\nLove, don't feel it could last forever\r\nLove, I'm ready to let you go\n\nAll the love we, all the love we\r\nAll the love we had is fading\r\nAll the love we, all the love we\r\nAll the love we had is fading\r\nAll the love we, all the love we\r\nAll the love we had is fading\r\nAll the love we\r\nAll the love we had is fading\r\nLove, don't feel it could last forever\r\nLove, I'm ready to let you know\n\nLove, don't feel it could last forever\r\nLove, I'm ready to let you go\r\nI'm ready to let you know this feeling won't last forever"
