  "lyrics": "Every night's the same\r\nAnd I'm to blame, I know it\r\nDon't know how I got my head up out of bed tonight\r\nOpen doors and I'm feeling so unstable\r\nSticky floors so they're dancing on the tables\r\n'Bout to go, but your show\r\nTook me so, so by surprise\r\nI'm lost in your movement\r\nI feel like we're fluid\r\n♪\r\nYou're not my lover, baby, you're my favorite song\r\nI've been watching how you move like all night long\r\nSending shivers down my arm like something's wrong\r\nWon't you tell me how you move me all night long\n\nAll night long\r\n♪\r\nWe're what the people want\r\nAnd so we flaunt, we know it\r\nDancing through the noise see the boys on the side\r\nWalk their way, see 'em prick up their antenna\r\nWalk away, 'cause we know we can do better\r\nTrick or treat, take a seat\r\nFor a long, long, long night\r\nI lost my composure\r\nI feel so much bolder\r\n♪\r\nYou're not my lover, baby, you're my favorite song\r\nI've been watching how you move like all night long\r\nSending shivers down my arm like something's wrong\r\nWon't you tell me how you move me all night long\r\nYou're not my lover, baby, you're my favorite song\r\nI've been watching how you move like all night long\r\nSending shivers down my arm like something's wrong\r\nWon't you tell me how you move me all night long"
