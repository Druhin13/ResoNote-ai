  "lyrics": "Baptized with a perfect name\r\nThe doubting one by heart\r\nAlone without himself\r\nWar between him and the day\r\nNeed someone to blame\r\nIn the end, little he can do alone\r\nYou believe but what you see\r\nYou receive but what you give\r\nCaress the one, the never-fading\r\nRain in your heart, the tears of snow-white sorrow\r\nCaress the one, the hiding amaranth\r\nIn a land of the daybreak\r\n♪\r\nApart from the wandering pack\r\nIn this brief flight of time\r\nWe reach for the ones, whoever dare\r\nYou believe but what you see\r\nYou receive but what you give\r\nCaress the one, the never-fading\r\nRain in your heart, the tears of snow-white sorrow\r\nCaress the one, the hiding amaranth\r\nIn a land of the daybreak\r\nCaress the one, the never-fading\r\nRain in your heart, the tears of snow-white sorrow\r\nCaress the one, the hiding amaranth\r\nIn a land of the daybreak\r\n♪\r\nReaching, searching for something untouched\r\nHearing voices of the never-fading calling (calling)\r\n♪\r\n(Calling)\r\n♪\r\nCaress the one, the never-fading\r\nRain in your heart, the tears of snow-white sorrow\r\nCaress the one, the hiding amaranth\r\nIn a land of the daybreak\r\nCaress the one, the never-fading\r\nRain in your heart, the tears of snow-white sorrow\r\nCaress the one, the hiding amaranth\r\nIn a land of the daybreak (daybreak)"
