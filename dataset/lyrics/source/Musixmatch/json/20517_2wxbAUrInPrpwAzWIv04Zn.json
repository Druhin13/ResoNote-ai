  "lyrics": "And you can feel my finger tips\r\nWith the lips you want to kiss\r\nIn the morning think,\r\nThat I'll never drink again\r\nAnd I've been thinking for a while\r\nI wanna go, instead I smile\r\nIt's been over quick,\r\nI just see you as a friend\r\nA friend\r\nIt's wasted, just face it\r\nSo move on, and take it\r\nIt's too much\r\nYou were never enough\r\nIt's all gone\r\nSo you gotta give up\r\nIt's wasted, just face it\r\nSo move on, and take it\r\nIt's too much\r\nYou were never enough\r\n(You were never enough)\r\nI don't know why you are so critical\r\nCause it was always something physical\r\nYou've got a new game\r\nAnd I don't wanna play\r\nSo don't show me your hand\r\nI hadn't thought this from the start\r\nBut maybe we need time apart\r\nStill I'm in preparation for another sign\r\nOh, I know it's easy to depend\r\nBut it is harder to pretend\r\nSo if it's separation\r\nNow's the perfect time\r\nIt's wasted, just face it\r\nSo move on, and take it\r\nIt's too much\r\nYou were never enough\r\nIt's all gone\r\nSo you gotta give up\r\nIt's wasted, just face it\r\nSo move on, and take it\r\nIt's too much\r\nYou were never enough\r\n(You were never enough)\r\nI don't know why you are so critical\r\nCause it was always something physical\r\nYou've got a new game\r\nAnd I don't wanna play\r\nSo don't show me your hand\r\nYou wonder why I always dodge your calls\r\nWe started something so illogical\r\nIt was a mistake\r\nSo if we took a break\r\nMaybe you'd understand"
