  "lyrics": "Caramelize\r\nYou make me blue\r\nI wanna make a man out of you\r\nThe light in the world is dull\r\nIt's more\r\nLike empty space through the darkness\r\nClosing my eyes and they start to sting\r\nFeeling my tear ducts doing their thing\r\nI'm kinda pretty, that's why you want it so bad\r\nWhen the heart gets too tender\r\nReturn it to the sender\r\nBe more centered\r\nIf you miss your friend\r\nCall them again\r\nLast night I got so swept up\r\nMy heart beat was kept up\r\nBy the song you gave to me\r\nIs it wrong or meant to be?\r\nWhen you rode off way back when\r\nI got this feeling I'd never see you again\r\nBut here you are in my bed\r\nHeart gets tender\r\nThose gaping wide\r\nSecret eyes\r\nClose on me\r\nThey don't wanna see\r\nI want in on the other side\r\nOf your eyelids where you hide\r\nOr further in that neatest dark\r\nBut my boyish emotion\r\nKeeps me soft like the ocean\r\nAre you relieved when I leave?\r\nThat I needed to be held\r\nIs a vice like anything else\r\nBut the others push it down\r\nOther vices to make it melt\r\nI just want to give you strength\r\nHelp you make all you can make\r\nThe extent to which you've grown on me\r\nI can feel now you've got a hold on me\r\nWhen you rode off way back when\r\nI got this feeling I'd never see you again\r\nBut here you are in my bed\r\nHeart gets tender"
