  "lyrics": "I go and I know I can't fear\r\nOh, calm yourself you're just not that a big deal\r\nOh, give me a break for goodness sake\r\nBecause you're giving my head an awful ache\r\n4 hours in bed, still I'm awake\r\nBut don't worry about me I know a place\r\nI go, when I know, I go\r\nI go, when I know, I go\r\nI go, when I know, I know\r\nI got stains on skin\r\nThey never get thin\r\nIt doesn't really matter\r\nWhat clothes I'm in\r\nI'll take the night off\r\nAnd call all my friends\r\nIt doesn't really matter what you said in the end\r\nI go and I know, I can't deal\r\nWith anyone or anything, it's too real\r\nBecause I'm tired of running in circles again\r\nLooking for a corner where boys become men\r\nAnd I want to be the one you heard about from your friend\r\nBut when you talk like that you can have me again"
