  "lyrics": "Welcome into my garden of eden\r\nI was guarding my heart for a reason\r\nCall it sin and they might call it treason\r\nI call it love\r\nI was trapped in the dark till you found me\r\nPull me in let temptation surround me\r\nBut the moment your arms are around me\r\nI fall in love\r\nThough their voices may echo\r\nPromise I'll never let go\r\nPromise you'll never let go\r\nSo what do we do when they say our love is forbidden\r\nAnd what if I don't wanna pray our love is forgiven\r\nI'm willing to fight every day of life that I'm given\r\nYou're a rule that I'm willing to break\r\nAn exception I'm willing to make\r\nYou're a risk that I'm willing to take\r\n♪\r\nTake my hand I know love's the solution\r\nAnd breathe in this love sinted pollution\r\nWelcome into the new revolution\r\nI call it hope\r\nLet them build up a wall to devide us\r\nLet them use all their weapons to fight us\r\nAll we need is something to ignite us\r\nAnd I call it hope\r\nThough their voices may echo\r\nPromise I'll never let go\r\nPromise you'll never let go\r\nSo what do we do when they say our love is forbidden\r\nAnd what if I don't wanna pray our love is forgiven\r\nI'm willing to fight every day of life that I'm given\r\nYou're a rule that I'm willing to break\r\nAn exception I'm willing to make\r\nYou're a risk that I'm willing to take\r\nYou're a risk that I'm willing to\r\nYou're a risk that I'm willing to take\r\nYeah\r\nIt might be us against the world\r\nOur voices will be heard\r\n(the sun shining from the rooftops,\r\nI'll sing from the top of my lungs.\r\nUntil our story's heard and the\r\nbattle of love is won. We're not gonna run)\r\nWe're not gonna run\r\nOur love is forbidden\r\nOur love is forgiven\r\nOh life I've been given\r\nA rule that I'm willing to, break\r\nAn exception I'm willing to, make\r\nYou're a risk that I'm willing to take\r\n(take my heart, I'm willing, our love will not be forbidden)\r\n♪\r\nYou're a rule that I'm willing to break\r\nAn exception I'm willing to make\r\nYou're a risk that I'm willing to take\r\nOur love won't be forbidden"
