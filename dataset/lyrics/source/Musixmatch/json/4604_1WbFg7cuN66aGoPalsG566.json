  "lyrics": "You didn't run away when you should've\r\nCaught up in the day, you mistook the\r\nVoices you heard for your friends\r\nWe all get hurt by the ending\r\nI didn't make you stay when I should've\r\nWe let the flicker fade when we could've\r\nHeld the whole world in your hands\r\nLive what we were where we standing\r\nOh, God!\r\nOh, God!\r\n♪\r\nYou know it's never one or the other\r\nI'm never feeling fine while you suffer\r\nWe were never built to forget\r\nDoesn't mean you still can resent me\r\nAlways on a course of collision\r\nThe road between relapse and remission\r\nSomething we can't comprehend\r\nWe still both care, but we're bending\r\nOh, God!\r\nOh, God!\n\nOh, God!\r\nOh, God!\r\nThey don't understand what we're missing\r\nTalking but they don't wanna listen\r\nMaybe they don't wanna know\r\nWhere there's a good chance they're going\r\nFalling out of place, what's the difference?\r\nThey putting on a face, won't admit it\r\nWe already know how it ends\r\nBut everybody stuck in pretending\r\nOh, God!\r\nOh, God!\n\nOh, God!\n\nOh, God!\r\n♪\r\nOh, God!\r\nOh, God!\r\n♪\r\nOh, God!\r\nOh, God!\r\n♪\r\nYou didn't run away when you should've\r\nCaught up in the day, you mistook the\r\nVoices you heard for your friends\r\nWe all get hurt by the ending"
