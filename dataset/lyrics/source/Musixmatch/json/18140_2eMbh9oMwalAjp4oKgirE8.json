  "lyrics": "We got dipped in silver\r\nWe got hollow cores\r\nWe had sacks of daylight\r\nWe were awful bored\r\nToo late we find our feet\r\nWe start rushing to the floor\r\nRushing to the floor\r\nAnd you might be captured\r\nAnd you can stay\r\nBut I'm moving away\r\nFrom dead photographers\r\nI'm moving away\r\nFrom dead photographers\r\nAll this beauty in the way\r\nAll this beauty in the way\r\nWe had shallow water\r\nWe had feet of clay\r\nWe had hours of daylight\r\nWe were turning gray\r\nToo late we find our tide\r\nDraining out into the bay\r\nOut into the bay\r\nAnd you might be captured\r\nAnd you can stay\r\nBut I'm moving away\r\nFrom dead photographers\r\nI'm moving away\r\nFrom dead photographers\r\nAll this beauty in the way\r\nAll this beauty in the way\r\nAnd you might be captured\r\nAnd you can stay\r\nBut I'm moving away\r\nFrom dead photographers\r\nI'm moving away\r\nFrom dead photographers\r\nAll this beauty in the way\r\nAll this beauty in the way"
