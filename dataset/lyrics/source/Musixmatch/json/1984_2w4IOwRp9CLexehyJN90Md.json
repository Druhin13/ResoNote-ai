  "lyrics": "Making the distinction between life and lore\r\nOdds favor the former when you wear a mask\r\nMasochism forming in the reflection\r\nAnd I'm trying not to turn into a psychopath\r\nBetter to have lost it then to find it tossed out\r\nThat's what I'm telling myself, wasn't I better than nothing?\n\nMaking a decision about steamed or fried\r\nWanted to be needed so I fed my cat\r\nThink I'll keep to myself for the next few days\r\nFeel a buzz that can't be bottled, smoked or canned\r\nSabotaging life just to find something to write about\r\nWhy was it always this way? And did I do it on purpose?\r\nâ™ª\r\nWaking from a vision that the schizoid built\r\nListening to puddles swallow melted snow\r\nSpring has sprung and finally it's not cold outside\r\nAnd I'm thinking about the places that I want to go\r\nPassion dissipates when it's fastened\r\nto the faces we wear only to become them\r\nLying to ourselves everyday becomes incredibly easy\r\nYes, incredibly easy\r\nYes, incredibly easy"
