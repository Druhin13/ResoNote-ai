  "lyrics": "We never had a chance to tell you goodbye\r\nYou cannot escape what you left behind\r\nWe never thought we could end up this way\r\nWe are aware of what we are\r\nWe are aware of what you are\r\nYou cannot hide from what you've made\r\nYou cannot keep us in this place\r\nI can see the color drain from your face\r\nPlease, why won't you understand?\r\nWe've done what you've planned\r\nAnd we cannot go (cannot go)\r\nWe are aware of what we did\r\nWe are aware of what you did\r\nWe will escape, we'll find a way\r\nWe will escape, and you will stay\r\nCan't keep me in this prison\r\nWe're built with superstition\r\nForce you into submission\r\nWe have a proposition\r\nWe are aware of what we did\r\nWe are aware of what you did\r\nWe will escape, we'll find a way\r\nWe will escape, and you will stay\r\nNo!\r\nWe are aware, you cannot hide\r\nWe are aware, you cannot hide\r\nWe are aware, you cannot hide\r\nAnd when we find you\r\nYou will die"
