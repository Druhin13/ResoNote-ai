  "lyrics": "You and I, we stole our highs\r\nAnd ran a while with the rosy eyes\r\nI'd do it again if I survive\r\nBut that ain't worth the risk, for\r\nHand of gold, but I can't let go\r\nBreach of bones and broken toes\r\nI've been doin' it 'til heaven shows\r\nThe fight for freedom's futile\r\nBow down and hurt\r\nLook what you do\r\nTo the woman who loves you\r\nBut I keep hopin' for the best\r\nTo the girls that you tried to fool\r\nIt's not what you say or do\r\nIt's all the many ways that you break us\r\nYour kingdom fell and took apart\r\nThat little beast that made your heart\r\nGet it back, so you can be a better man\r\nThan what we see\r\nCut the ties, I beg you please\r\nI cannot take a soulless thief\r\nFaith with you with me in tow\r\nFor me, it's not what I was sold\r\nBow down and hurt\r\nLook what you do\r\nTo the woman who loves you\r\nBut I keep hopin' for the best\r\nTo the girls that you tried to fool\r\nIt's not what you say or do\r\nIt's all the many ways that you break us"
