  "lyrics": "Love was a lighthouse guiding the way\r\nWe were two boats of the ocean\r\nFollowing shadows that led us astray\r\nCase of mistaken emotion\r\nSuddenly you've drifted back to my arms\r\nAnd while we were lost in the dark\r\nLove stood still\r\nMovin' us together\r\nLove stood still\r\nLeading us towards each other\r\nNow we're back at the start\r\n'Cause while we were apart\r\nLove stood still\r\nâ™ª\r\nLove was a fire burned down to the coast\r\nWaiting for something to spark\r\nWe were two fireflies drawn to the glow\r\nSinging you lit the flames in my heart\r\nI had no reason for letting you go\r\nBut to hold you again, I know\r\nLove stood still\r\nPullin' us together\r\nLove stood still\r\nLeading us towards each other\r\nNow we're back at the start\r\n'Cause while we were apart\r\nLove stood still\r\nNow you asked me to say\r\nI'll always feel this way\r\nNow that nothing has ever change\r\nLove stood still\r\nMovin' us together\r\nLove stood still\r\nLeading us towards each other\r\nNow we're back at the start\r\n'Cause while we were apart\r\nLove stood still\r\nLove stood still\r\nLove stood still"
