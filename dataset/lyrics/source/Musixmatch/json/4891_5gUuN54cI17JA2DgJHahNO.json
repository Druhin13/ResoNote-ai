  "lyrics": "You paint me red in this light that isn't mine\r\nFinding every reason you can find\r\nTo question my love\r\nRemember that it's not me\r\nI was never the one who broke your heart\r\nWe both know I've been gentle from the start\r\nSo though the questions keep on coming, this time\r\nYou know that I'll listen\r\nYou know I'll be patient\r\nWith you, you're my baby\r\nMaybe this time, you'll know you can trust me\r\nYou know I'll be faithful\r\nTo you, you're my baby\r\n♪\r\nI was never cheating\r\nYou connected dots that weren't there\r\nYou gave attention to the thoughts I'd never wear\r\nIt's not my style\r\nEven though it's so clear to me\r\nYou shouldn't base the future on the past\r\nI know you really want this thing to last\r\nSo though the questions keep on coming, this time\r\nYou know that I'll listen\r\nYou know I'll be patient\r\nWith you, you're my baby\r\nMaybe this time, you'll know you can trust me\r\nYou know I'll be faithful\r\nTo you, you're my baby\r\n♪\r\nI don't wanna fight, now\r\nYour bark and your bite, now\r\nTo prove that I'm right, now\r\nThat you've lost your sight, now\r\nI'm holding it tight, now\r\nCan't see through the night, how\r\nTo show you my light, now\r\nTo paint these walls white, now\r\nI don't wanna fight, now\r\nYour bark and your bite, now\r\nTo prove that I'm right, now\r\nThat you've lost your sight, now\r\nI'm holding it tight, now\r\nCan't see through the night, how\r\nTo show you my light, now\r\nTo paint these walls white, now\r\nSo though the questions keep on coming, this time\r\nYou know that I'll listen\r\nYou know I'll be patient\r\nWith you, you're my baby\r\nMaybe this time, you'll know you can trust me\r\nYou know I'll be faithful\r\nSo though the questions keep on coming, this time\r\nYou know that I'll listen\r\nYou know I'll be patient\r\nWith you, you're my baby\r\nMaybe this time, you'll know you can trust me\r\nYou know I'll be faithful\r\nTo you, you're my baby\r\nTo you, you're my baby\r\nTo you, you're my baby\r\nTo you, you're my baby\r\nI don't wanna fight, now\r\nYour bark and your bite, now\r\nTo prove that I'm right, now\r\nThat you've lost your sight, now\r\nI'm holding it tight, now\r\nCan't see through the night, how\r\nTo show you my light, now\r\nTo paint these walls white, now"
