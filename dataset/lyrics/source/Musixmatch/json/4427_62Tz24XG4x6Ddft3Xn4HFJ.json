  "lyrics": "If I could save time in a bottle\r\nThe first thing that I'd like to do\r\nIs to save every day till eternity passes away\r\nJust to spend them with you\r\nIf I could make days last forever\r\nIf words could make wishes come true\r\nI'd save every day like a treasure and then\r\nAgain, I would spend them with you\r\nBut there never seems to be enough time\r\nTo do the things you want to do, once you find them\r\nI've looked around enough to know\r\nThat you're the one I want to go through time with\r\nâ™ª\r\nIf I had a box just for wishes\r\nAnd dreams that had never come true\r\nThe box would be empty, except for the memory of how\r\nThey were answered by you\r\nBut there never seems to be enough time\r\nTo do the things you want to do, once you find them\r\nI've looked around enough to know\r\nThat you're the one I want to go through time with"
