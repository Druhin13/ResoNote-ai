  "lyrics": "Your sundress and bleach blonde hair\r\nAdolescent vacant stare\r\nMy peace of mind\r\nCure the thoughts swimming in my head\r\nImprompt decisions\r\nLate nights in love\r\nForgone conclusions\r\nTell me what you're thinking of\r\nJust leave me out to dry\r\nBeen lost here for the longest time\r\nI can't even win\r\nI'll just breathe you in\r\nIt's the end of an era\r\nIt's a fall from grace\r\nYou said you needed time\r\nYou said you needed space\r\nAnd no simple lie\r\nIt's wishful thinking\r\nYou and I\r\nFelt like dreaming\r\nBut you left me out to dry\r\nI've been living off of borrowed time\r\nI can't even win\r\nI'll just breathe you in\r\nIt's the end of an era\r\nIt's a fall from grace\r\nYou said you needed time\r\nYou said you needed space\r\nYou can leave if you wanna\r\nSomeone will take my place\r\nSo in the meantime\r\nCan we fade away\r\nI used to know who you were\r\nNow I know who you're not\r\nForgetting all that I learned\r\nSuch a freeing thought\r\nDo I miss you when I have nothing else\r\nCan I win when I'm losing myself\r\nWas what we had even real\r\nSo I keep looking back\r\nAnd I refuse to believe that\r\nIt's the end of an era\r\nIt's a fall from grace\r\nYou said you needed time\r\nYou said you needed space\r\nYou can leave if you wanna\r\nSomeone will take my place\r\nSo in the meantime\r\nCan we fade away\r\nCan we fade away"
