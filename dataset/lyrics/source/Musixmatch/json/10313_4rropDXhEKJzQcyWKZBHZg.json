  "lyrics": "I want you to be happy\r\nWhy are you still with him?\r\nI'm not saying be with me\r\nI know how tough it would feel but\r\nLet's run away, we can go anywhere\r\nLet's go to space, let's run to la la land\r\nShow me your head\r\nShow me your pretty hair\r\nAnd life, life's not fair\r\nIt's hard but I will love you\r\nIt's hard but I will love you\r\nI thought because of him\r\nThat I don't appeal to you\r\nI guess it was just me\r\nI don't know what to do no\r\nI'll give you anything you want in life\r\nGive you a ring and buy a pool to dive in\r\nYou know it's right, and you know it's fair\r\nBut the love, the love's not there\r\nIt's hard but I will love you\r\nIt's hard but I will love you"
