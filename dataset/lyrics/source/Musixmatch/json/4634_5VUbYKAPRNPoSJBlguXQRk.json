  "lyrics": "Let's not pretend\r\nWe're not a loose cannon ending\r\nAnd I tried to take it backwards and it wasn't enough\r\nOoh, not thinking 'bout you\r\nSo when I come try you out\r\nLike a drink I tasted once\r\nThat I set aside not thinking 'cause it wasn't enough\r\nOoh, not thinking 'bout you\r\n♪\r\nOoh, not thinking 'bout you\r\nAnd some fire's burning, breathe in\r\nClear the smoke from my lungs\r\nIn a stare down conversation where you don't make a sound\r\nAnd it's lost all of the meaning 'cause it wasn't enough\r\nOoh, I'm not thinking 'bout you\r\nBut can I come try you out?\r\n(So you said it was good, so it's good till it's gone)\r\nBut can I come try you out?\r\n(So we're dead to the feeling and gone in the morning)\r\nAnd it's lost all of the meaning 'cause it wasn't enough\r\nOoh, not thinking 'bout you\r\nMemories faded cause evaporation of truth\r\nI was just stating, stay patient, I'll get back to you\r\nWe need that closure through contact\r\nIf love is a battle, let's have one last combat\r\nYour high notes the climax\r\nCan't sing with your fine ass\r\nGot talents, most brothers probably would finance\r\nSay less, when that late text come ringing\r\nSlight ex, but that late sex says different\r\nThen the magic happens, when we say we can't remember\r\nBetter practice being at distance, we create from feeling symptoms\r\nFuck them feelings\r\nI be at home, Netflix chilling\r\nWith myself and grilled chicken, cooked and mashed the way you did me\r\nBittersweet a symphony, and now you can't hear me\r\nNot thinking 'bout the past or anything near it\r\nSo when I come try you out\r\nLike a drink I tasted once\r\nThat I set aside not thinking 'cause it wasn't enough\r\nOoh, I'm not thinking 'bout you\r\nSo when I come try you out\r\nSo when I come try you out\r\nAnd it's lost all of the meaning 'cause it wasn't enough\r\nOoh, not thinking 'bout you\r\nNot thinking 'bout you\r\n♪\r\nOoh, not thinking 'bout you"
