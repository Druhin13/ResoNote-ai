  "lyrics": "No hands to warm,\r\nNo bedtime story, no lullaby,\r\nNo little steps in the middle of the night\r\nAnd the nation's numb,\r\nIs this what our forefathers had in mind\r\nWhat is happening in Washington\r\nIt's not enough\r\nYour thoughts and prayers\r\nYou send your love, you say you care\r\nBut you are not my baby\r\n♪\r\nOh but my heart has died,\r\nStanding alone in an empty room,\r\nExcept for my child but\r\nShe's not really there\r\nAnd the people have gone,\r\nAnd I want to pick her up and take her home\r\nI can't bear to leave her here\r\nIt's not enough\r\nYour thoughts and prayers\r\nYou send your love, you say you care\r\nBut you are not my baby\r\n♪\r\nOh bless the child, oh rest their souls,\r\nI bet those law makers don't know\r\nThis feeling that...\r\nIt's not enough\r\nYour thoughts and prayers\r\nYou send your love, you say you care\r\nBut you are not my baby\r\nCan you do something\r\nSo that there's not more gone babies"
