  "lyrics": "I woke up this morning to a garbage truck\r\nLooks like this old horseshoe's done run out of luck\r\nIf I came home, would you let me in?\r\nFry me some pork chops and forgive my sin?\r\nSurround me with your boundless love\r\nConfound me with your boundless love\r\nI was drowning in the sea, lost as I could be\r\nWhen you found me with your boundless love\r\nSometimes my old heart is like a washing machine\r\nIt bounces around 'til my soul comes clean\r\nAnd when I'm clean and hung out to dry\r\nI'm gonna make you laugh until you cry\r\nSurround me with your boundless love\r\nConfound me with your boundless love\r\nI was drowning in the sea, lost as I could be\r\nWhen you found me with your boundless love\r\nâ™ª\r\nIf by chance I should find myself at risk\r\nA-falling from this jagged cliff\r\nI look below, and I look above\r\nI'm surrounded by your boundless love\r\nSurround me with your boundless love\r\nConfound me with your boundless love\r\nI was drowning in the sea, lost as I could be\r\nWhen you found me with your boundless love\r\nYou dumbfound me with your boundless love\r\nYou surround me with your boundless love"
