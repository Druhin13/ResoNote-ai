  "lyrics": "Lean down, here's my shoulder\r\nIt's been a while, you've been growing tall\r\nI don't know why but I'm feeling small\r\nFind a way to hold her\r\nIt's kinda hard for me to reach up\r\nI promise you she will measure up\r\nI'm stepping in tho I'm so far away\r\nNever thought I'd care\r\nI never thought I'd care this way\r\nI woke up like a warrior, warrior, warrior\r\nUp like a warrior, up like a warrior\r\nWe were no longer lovers, lovers, lovers\r\nI woke up like a warrior, up like a warrior\r\nLet them wet my shoulder\r\nIt's been a while since I saw you cry\r\nAll the tears gonna make you blind\r\nFind a way to kiss her\r\nIt's been a long time since you tried\r\nI promise you you will be just fine\r\nI'm stepping in tho I am in denial\r\nNever thought I'd cry\r\nI never thought I'd cry all the time\r\nI woke up like a warrior, warrior, warrior\r\nUp like a warrior, up like a warrior\r\nWe were no longer lovers, lovers, lovers\r\nI woke up like a warrior, up like a warrior"
