  "lyrics": "And maybe my god\r\nHas a trot in her walk\r\nAnd her coach bags are knock-off\r\nHer shoes are all dressed up\r\nAnd she spins me around like a marionette\r\nOh my web is still spinning\r\nMy web is still spinning\r\nMy web is still spinning\r\nYou can't see it yet\r\n♪\r\nOr maybe my god\r\nHas thick hips and big lips\r\nAnd the buttons she's pressing\r\nShe speaks every language\r\nShift A, right B, Nintendo 63\r\nOn her video, baby\r\nThe game she's been changing\r\n♪\r\nWhen you're drunk near a sunset\r\nLook straight in her eyes\r\nShe's a quick glimpse of heaven\r\nForgetting her headlights are on\r\nWhen you misread her fortune\r\nDon't misread the joke\r\nShe's the note on your lampshade\r\nThe honeycomb holding you\r\n♪\r\nAnd she spins me around like a marionette\r\nOh my web is still spinning\r\nMy web is still spinning\r\nMy web is still spinning\r\nYou can't see it yet"
