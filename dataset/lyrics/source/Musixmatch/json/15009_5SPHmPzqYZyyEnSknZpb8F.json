  "lyrics": "Don't let me go, don't let me out\r\nI'm trying figure out all of these wounds I've found\r\nIt's haunting me, what I'm going through\r\nBut I know you've felt pain so I'll relate to you\r\nAnd my demons, I cannot stand them\r\nI just seem to hate my fear\r\nBut I'm dancing all around chances\r\nTo become greatness dear\r\nAnd I've been struggling and hurting\r\nBut I know that life is worth it when I finally speak out\r\nAll the love from you surrounds me\r\nAnd I see your heart has found me and it's saving me now\r\nLost in all this mess\r\nI might find you there\r\nI'll reach out my hand\r\nFollow every step\r\nWe'll find a way out\r\nLost in all this mess\r\nFind a way out\r\nLost in all this mess\r\nChasing all my dreams, I forget myself\r\nForget why all this started and forget my health\r\nThe most important person really should be me\r\nI should be free but freedom doesn't come for free\r\nI'm holding onto a thread\r\nAnd I can barely cope\r\nI'm holding onto this pain I have\r\nAnd it's taking all of my hope\r\nBut then I speak out\r\nAll the demons inside of me, I breathe out\r\nAnd I let go of my past\r\nI see your hand when it reaches out, so let's go\r\nThe beauty of this life is we don't know\r\nBut over time we grow, find our ways through every low\r\nI believe you, under all your barriers I see you\r\nTrue to you, this beautiful mess that we can see through\r\nSo don't let me go\r\nDon't let me out\r\nI'm slowly letting go of all these wounds I've found\r\nLost in all this mess\r\nI might find you there\r\nI'll reach out my hand\r\nFollow every step\r\nWe'll find a way out\r\nLost in all this mess\r\nFind a way out\r\nLost in all this mess"
