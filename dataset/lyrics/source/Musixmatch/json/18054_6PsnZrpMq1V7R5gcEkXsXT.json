  "lyrics": "I'm getting so tired of the inside of my bedroom\r\nForce myself to go outside and get some light\r\nWear a t-shirt that's not black\r\nGet myself into the shower stay inside there for an hour\r\nBarely get back home on time I'm just fine\r\nI'm always double parked my car won't start you ripped my heart out\r\nAnd it's hurting so bad\r\nBut that's alright I'll be fine if this bleeding won't subside\r\n'Cause it keeps me warm\r\n'Cause it's so hard\r\nTo change your clothes\r\nEvery morning\r\nSo lend me your ears I'll keep you safe\r\nAs long as you let me\r\n'Cause I'm so sad\r\nWhenever you're not here\r\nAnd I need you\r\nMore than\r\nYou need me"
