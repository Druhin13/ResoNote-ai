  "lyrics": "And I get no sleep\r\nI dream underwater\r\nWhales and tigers they roll in my dreams\r\nWe can talk about it\r\nAnd I get no sleep\r\nBut I dream underwater\r\nI waste all my years laying under the stars\r\nJust dreaming 'bout it\r\nResting my bones just waiting for silence\r\nWe could all use a little more quiet\r\nWith my diary on the desk\r\nScreaming at me\r\nIt's an ineffable thing\r\nWith the wind soaring on the way\r\nThrough the nefarious night\r\nA cold hand touches me\r\nPulls me deep underwater\r\nI'm free\r\nA quiver I keep I think, It's time\r\nDown to the deep it all survives\r\nStruggling to see\r\nFades black\r\nWhales and symphonies\r\nAt my back\r\nMellifluous flow calls me home and I\r\nBreathe underwater and so\r\nNow I'm brand new\r\nAnd I get no sleep\r\nBut I dream underwater"
