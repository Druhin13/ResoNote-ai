  "lyrics": "A bright blue sky's what I used to see but\r\nMy vision's been torn after all that's been\r\nAnd I know it's not right and I've crossed the line but\r\nPlease understand that there was a time where\r\nI let my heart go, just to watch it burn\r\nSo I told myself, \"It's a lesson learned\"\r\nBut did I really learn?\r\nJealousy, I guess you're finally takin' over me\r\nJealousy, I'm suffering from your control\r\nAnd you're covering me like a bear skin coat\r\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\r\nJealousy, oh, can't you stay away from me?\r\nThe voices inside of my head\r\nKeep me wondering where we're at\r\nLike a fire, it starts to spread\r\nCovering up my skin and flesh, and\r\nI keep fighting\r\nBut the monster won't let me win, oh\r\nI keep fighting\r\nBut the monster won't let me win, oh\r\nJealousy, I guess you're finally takin' over me\r\nJealousy, I'm suffering from your control\r\nAnd you're covering me like a bear skin coat\r\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\r\nJealousy, oh, can't you stay away from me?\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh\r\nI can't breathe, I've lost my soul\r\n'Cause you've taken all I thought I'd know\r\nâ™ª\r\nAnd you're covering me like a bear skin coat\r\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\r\n(Ooh, ooh) and you're covering me like a bear skin coat\r\n(Ooh, ooh) getting harder to breathe under your control\r\nJealousy, I guess you're finally taking over me\r\n(Ooh, ooh) jealousy, I'm suffering from your control (ooh, ooh)\r\nAnd you're covering me like a bear skin coat\r\nGetting harder to breathe under your control (ooh, ooh)\r\nJealousy, oh, can't you stay away from me? (Ooh, ooh)\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh"
