  "lyrics": "I'm running around in here\r\nSpinning in circles inside my head\r\nBut I retrace the steps to retrace steps\r\nI just retrace the steps to retrace steps\r\nI've learned to embrace the fear\r\nAnd nothing I believe will take me\r\nPast the edge I'm past the edge\r\nPast the edge I'm past the edge\r\nAnd you've left me with no choice\r\nMy hands are tied and I won't listen\r\nBloodlust is real\r\nI never thought I'd be right here\r\nBut the bloodlust is real\r\nYou can't make me feel alive\r\nI will be your animal\r\nYou can be my cannibal\r\nâ™ª\r\nEverything is closing in\r\nSurrounded by the darkness\r\nAnd I dive right in and I dive right in\r\nI cannot swim but I dive right in\r\nVision is blurred and I start to spin\r\nThe walls come crashing down\r\nAnd I'm alone again, I'm alone again\r\nAlone again, I'm alone again\r\nAnd you left me no choice\r\nThe urge is real and you can't help me\r\nBloodlust is real\r\nI never thought I'd be right here\r\nBut the bloodlust is real\r\nYou can't make me feel alive\r\nI will be your animal\r\nYou can be my cannibal\n\nI wrote a letter that you'll never read\r\nI shed a tear that you'll never see\r\nI'm buried with these words that I never speak\r\nI am the darkness that you'll never see\r\nBloodlust is real\r\nBloodlust is real\r\nBloodlust is real\r\nI never thought I'd be right here\r\nBut the bloodlust is real\r\nYou can't make me feel alive\r\nI will be your animal\r\nYou can be my cannibal"
