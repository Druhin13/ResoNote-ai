  "lyrics": "No body so no shadow where I stand\r\nDifferent kind of blood, in my mouth is a gem\r\nI'm more than man\r\nIn my heart and eyes there's a pain\r\nTension's building in these bands again\r\nIt's Official\r\nYou're listening to Wicca Phase Springs Eternal\r\nGothBoiClique\r\nEsoteric god, Aramaic texts\r\nLighting candles up\r\nMake a pact while you light another cigarette\r\nShadows cast on walls\r\nI project my second body as a silhouette\r\nI reach out to her and I call her by her name\r\nCorinthiax, I'll see you soon\r\nThe dark manifestation\r\nOf the love that I was given from a hollow moon\r\nShe said she's a bad one, always on attack, now I call for you\r\nEven though these feelings come in waves\r\nStemmed from sacred texts\r\nI reach out to her and I call her by her name\r\nCorinthiax, Corinthiax\r\nYes, she is a bad one, but I got her back\r\nCorinthiax, Corinthiax\r\nI call out to her, intentions of better tracks\r\nCorinthiax, Corinthiax\r\nYes, she is a bad one, but I got her back"
