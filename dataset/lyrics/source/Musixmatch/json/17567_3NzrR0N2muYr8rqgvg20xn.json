  "lyrics": "You got a fast car\r\nI want a ticket to anywhere\r\nMaybe we make a deal\r\nMaybe together we can get somewhere\r\nAny place is better\r\nStart from zero got nothing to lose\r\nMaybe we'll make something\r\nMe, myself, I've got nothing to prove\r\n♪\r\nYou got a fast car\r\nI've got a plan to get us outta here\r\nI've been working at the convenience store\r\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\r\nWon't have to drive too far\r\nJust 'cross the border and into the city\r\nYou and I can both get jobs\r\nAnd finally see what it means to be livin'\r\n♪\r\nSee my old man's got a problem\r\nHe live with the bottle, that's the way it is\r\nHe says his body's too old for working\r\nBody's too young to look like his\r\nMy mama went off and left him\r\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\r\nI said somebody's got to take care of him\r\nI quit school, that's what I did\r\n♪\r\nYou got a fast car\r\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\r\nWe gotta make a decision\r\nWe leave tonight or live and die this way\r\n♪\r\nSo I remember when we were driving\r\nDriving in your car\r\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\r\nCity lights lay out before us\r\nYour arms felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\r\nAnd I, I had a feeling that I belonged\r\nI, I had a feeling I could be someone\r\nBe someone, be someone\r\n♪\r\nYou got a fast car\r\nWe go cruising, entertain ourselves\r\nStill I ain't got a job\r\nNow I work in the market as a checkout boy\r\nI know things will get better\r\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\r\nAnd we'll move out of the shelter\r\nFind a bigger house and live in the suburbs\r\n♪\r\nSo I remember when we were driving\r\nDriving in your car\r\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\r\nCity lights lay out before us\r\nYour arms felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\r\nAnd I, I had a feeling that I belonged\r\nI, I had a feeling I could be someone\r\nBe someone, be someone\r\n♪\r\nYou've got a fast car\r\nI got a job that pays all our bills\r\nYou stay out drinking late at the bar\r\nSee more of your friends than you do of your kids\r\nI'd always hoped for the better\r\nMaybe together you and me would find it\r\nI got no plans, I ain't going nowhere\r\nTake your fast car and keep on driving\r\n♪\r\nSo I remember when we were driving\r\nDriving in your car\r\nSpeed so fast, it felt like I was drunk\r\nCity lights lay out before us\r\nYour arms felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\r\nAnd I, I had a feeling that I belonged\r\nI, I had a feeling I could be someone\r\nBe someone, be someone\r\n♪\r\nYou got a fast car\r\nIs it fast enough so you can fly away?\r\nWe gotta make a decision\r\nLeave tonight or live and die this way"
