  "lyrics": "The moment we all fall apart tonight\r\nHate it or love it, it's allright\r\nCause we ain't got no ground to build things up\r\nEndlessy talking, we so stuck\r\nWe owned it, but\r\nWe lost it, burn\r\nThe fire\r\nCause we will go up into flames\r\nWe owned it, but\r\nWe lost it, burn\r\nThe fire\r\nCause we will go up into flames\r\nThe memories that we had\r\nWe can't go on, we can't go on\r\nThere's nothing fighting for\r\nNot longer in my bed\r\nWe can't go on, we can't go on\r\nThere's nothing fighting for\r\nAs soon as you are walking out that door\r\nYou not see my crying no more\r\nCause if it's like you cut me with a knife\r\nFast and deep down what is my life\r\nWe owned it, but\r\nWe lost it, burn\r\nThe fire\r\nCause we will go into flames\r\nWe owned it, but\r\nWe lost it, burn\r\nThe fire\r\nCause we will go up into flames\r\nThe memories that we had\r\nWe can't go on, we can't go on\r\nThere's not fighting for\r\nNot longer in my bed\r\nWe can't go on, we can't go on\r\nThere's nothing fighting for"
