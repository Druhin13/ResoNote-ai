  "lyrics": "Every night and every day\r\nYou're busy wondering what you'll say\r\nYou're picking up that extra pace\r\nAnd now it's up to you\r\nBut it is alright to lose\r\n♪\r\nBut it is alright to lose\r\n♪\r\nSeeking out those extra fights\r\nYou say it's wrong you say its right\r\nYou're pushing hard that you're alright\r\nBut it is up to you\r\nCos it is alright to lose\n\nCos it is alright to lose yeah\r\n♪\r\nEvery time you walk away\r\nIt's you\r\nIt's you\r\nThat walks right back into it\r\n♪\r\nEvery time you walk away\r\nIt's you\r\nIt's you\r\nThat walks right back into it\r\n♪\r\nBut you know, the things you never say never come true\r\nWhere to go, you think about it when there's nothing to lose (But it is alright to lose)\r\nYou're taking off masks when you know that you'll last and you say that you're gassed\r\nWhen you're really just barely started\r\n(But it is alright to lose)\r\nI can't read your mind\r\nSafe to say for now\r\nBut I know that you will be fine\n\nEvery time you walk away\r\nIt's you\r\nIt's you\r\nThat walks right back into it\r\n♪\r\nEvery time you walk away\r\nIt's you\r\nIt's you\r\nThat walks right back into it"
