Clap clap clap)\r\nIs it love?\r\nOr is it simply something else?\r\nSometimes I think I'm caught under a spell\r\n(Stella Stella Ola! Clap clap clap)\r\nI'm floatin' like a satellite\r\nLike the sound of the ocean\r\nJust rollin' around in the blue\r\nIt is just me without a clue\r\nI'm tryin' to find the truth\r\nI'm tryin' to find the truth\r\nIs it us?\r\nOr is it supernatural?\r\nSometimes we fall so fast it's hard to tell\r\n(Stella Stella Ola! Clap clap clap)\r\nIs it love?\r\nOr is it simply something else?\r\nSometimes I think I'm caught under a spell\r\n♪\r\n(Stella Stella Ola! Clap clap clap)\r\nIs it us?\r\nOr is it supernatural?\r\nSometimes we fall so fast it's hard to tell\r\n(Stella Stella Ola! Clap clap clap)\r\nIs it love?\r\nOr is it simply something else?\r\nSometimes I think I'm caught under a spell\r\n(Stella Stella Ola! Clap clap clap)"
