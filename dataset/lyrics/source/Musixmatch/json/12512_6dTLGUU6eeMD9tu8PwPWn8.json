  "lyrics": "It's heavy now, we don't change\r\nCome back down, keep it safe\r\nSpinning room, lost my mind\r\nKeep it up, killing time\r\nDon't wait up, it'll be okay\r\nThough it's coming at me like a tidal wave\r\nâ™ª\r\nPick it up as if you found\r\nPeace of mind in shattered sound\r\nExtra days to sit around\r\nWonder why you can't be found\r\nDon't wait up, it'll be okay\r\nThough it's coming at me like a tidal wave\r\nHeaven starts by my side\r\nHurry up, leave this behind\r\nFickle love, I'll call you out\r\nIf we don't change it now\r\nHoliday is on my mind\r\nYou still take me by surprise\r\nTruth, it breaks by the night\r\nIf we don't change we're stuck in time"
