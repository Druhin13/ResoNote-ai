  "lyrics": "Condemned to the gallows\r\n♪\r\nGoodnight...\n\nGripping the brightest grid\r\nA surgical drive to increase the noise\r\nIce cold realization of the silent wind...\r\nslowly drags me up into a splintered reason\r\nEmptiness engulf me\r\nAlign the love inside me\r\nLet misery wake me\r\n♪\r\nSearch low... abandoned\r\nThe creaking floors cry out below\r\nA limping glimpse of next steps...\r\nthe fog showers the last light of day\r\n(voice of trespass)\r\nDestroy the wooden frame\r\nTrust the creaking sounds\r\n♪\r\nSeek the tunnel... to walk high above\r\nSearch low\r\n♪\r\nConfront the night\r\n♪\r\nWarm blood drips on cold snow...\r\nthe curtain surrounds logical thought\r\nCondemned to the gallows\r\n♪\r\nThe crimson moonbeam lights my journey\r\nCrippled with time... desperate strides into nothing\r\nThe crimson moonbeam... hear the waking\r\nCrippled with time... desperate strides into nothing"
