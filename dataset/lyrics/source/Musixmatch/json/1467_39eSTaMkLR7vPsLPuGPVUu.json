  "lyrics": "Where have you been, Virginia?\r\nThere was a time when you stood by my side\r\nThrough dark and dire days\n\nBut now you're cold and you're cursing your words\r\nAnd now you're throwing our love to the birds\r\nOr is there somebody else that you're dreaming, of?\r\nI used to think we could make it all the way\r\nI used to carry our love in a fire-safe\r\nBut now it's gone! And I'm a ghost!\r\nBaby, look, why ain't you calling me?\r\nI'll give it up, and you could have all of me\r\nI don't wanna go home!\r\n♪\r\nWalking around the same lines\r\nTo get a taste of everlasting life like what we knew before\n\nBut now your mama don't want you with me\r\nAnd I'm the apple that fell from the tree\r\nYou're turning into a stone but I still love you\r\nSomebody show me if there's another way\r\nI never saved any love for a rainy day\r\nThe radio, another sun-rise!\r\n♪\r\nThe radio, another sun!\r\nBaby, look, why ain't you calling me?\r\nI'll give it up, and you could have all of me\r\nI don't wanna go home!\r\nClimbing up, into your fire escape\r\nThe lights are off, but nothing that I can't wait\r\nI don't wanna go home!\r\nWhy Virginia, please I'm on my knees underwater\r\nVirginia please I'm on my knees underwater\r\nVirginia please I'm on my knees underwater\r\nVirginia please I'm on my knees underwater\r\nVirginia please I'm on my knees underwater\r\nVirginia please I'm on my knees underwater\r\nVirginia Please"
