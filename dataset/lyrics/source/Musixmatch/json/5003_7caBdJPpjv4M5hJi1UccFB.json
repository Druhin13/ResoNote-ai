  "lyrics": "Summer night, drinking wine\r\nBy the fire, catching up\r\nYou looking good, wish I could\r\nTell you I was over us\r\nBut I get high every night when I'm all alone\r\n'Cause it helps me forget that I'm feeling low\r\nTold you I was doing fine\r\nIt's a lie, you should know\r\nBut if you want the truth\r\nI'm still in love with you\r\nNo matter what I do\r\nI'm still in love with you\r\nTell myself I don't care\r\nWho you're with, I'm losing my mind\n\nI picture you making love to someone else\r\nTell me why\r\nI get drunk to shut up all these memories\r\nBut I wake up and they come running back to me\r\nSo have your fun giving up\r\nI guess you won, I messed up\r\nAnd I'm acting a fool\r\n'Cause I'm still in love with you\r\nNo matter what I do\r\nI'm still in love with you\r\nTell me you want me too\r\n'Cause I'm still in love with you\r\nAnd it's killing me\r\nEndlessly\r\n'Cause I'm bound to be\r\nSomebody's helplessly desperately\r\nStill in love\r\nâ™ª\r\n'Cause I'm still in love with you\r\nI'm still in love with you\r\nTell me you want me too\r\nI'm still in love with you"
