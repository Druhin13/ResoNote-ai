  "lyrics": "Throwed out of the bar, can't find your car\r\nSwear somebody stole your keys\r\nDrunk and alone, tryna get home\r\nYou need a friend like me\r\n♪\r\nNothing sticks if you give up too quick\r\nYou end up on your knees\r\nYou're afraid of the dark\r\nThat's called a new height\r\nYou need a friend like me\r\nYou don't have to settle down\r\nI want you how you are right now\r\nI know you wanna fix it all\r\nBut who's gonna catch you when you fall\r\nAnd I need you, but you need me too\r\nMaybe you don't believe\r\nI think you need a friend like me\r\n♪\r\nYou're lost in the crowd\r\nSaw your head in the clouds\r\nBut I can always see\r\nWho you are and you have come so far\r\nYou need a friend like me\r\nI'll hold you closer\r\nDon't you know I'm here\r\nYou don't have to settle down\r\nI want you how you are right now\r\nI know you wanna fix it all\r\nBut who's gonna catch you when you fall\r\nAnd I need you, but you need me too\r\nMaybe you don't believe\r\nI think you need a friend like me\r\n♪\r\nI'll hold you closer\r\nDon't you know I'm here\r\nYou don't have to settle down\r\nI want you how you are right now\r\nI know you wanna fix it all\r\nBut who's gonna catch you when you fall\r\nYou don't have to change your mind\r\nI'm gonna wear you down in time\r\nWe will never get it right\r\nBut sure as hell I'm gonna try\r\n'Cause I need you and you need me too\r\nYeah you can count on me\r\n'Cause I'm a friend indeed\r\nEven if you don't believe\r\nYou need a friend like me"
