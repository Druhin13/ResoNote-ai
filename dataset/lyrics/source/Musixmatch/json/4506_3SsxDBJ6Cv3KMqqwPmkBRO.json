  "lyrics": "You'll be living life inside of a lens and\r\nShare it to the word like they're dying to see\r\nWhile all my friends say you're down to earth\r\nI know the truth, you should know your worth\r\nBut your camera keeps flashing\r\nOn the things you imagined\r\nI'm not over-reacting\r\nThis is more than just fashion\r\nI don't need to remind you\r\nI just think you need time to really see this\r\nGirl, you need this\r\nPut down your camera\r\nAnd look me in the eyes\r\n'Cause you are damaged\r\nI hope you realize there is an answer\r\nThat's not in the photographs\r\nWith fake friends that make you laugh when I can't\r\n♪\r\nWake up and you'll scroll through all of your likes\r\nYour eyes are on the screen before they even meet mine\r\nWhile all your friends say you're looking fine\r\nI know that you'll never be alright\r\nBut your camera keeps flashing\r\nOn the things you imagined\r\nI'm not over-reacting\r\nThis is more than just fashion\r\nI don't need to remind you\r\nI just think you need time to really see this\r\nGirl, you need this\r\nPut down your camera\r\nAnd look me in the eyes\r\n'Cause you are damaged\r\nI hope you realize there is an answer\r\nThat's not in the photographs\r\nWith fake friends that make you laugh when I can't\r\n♪\r\nWhile all my friends say you're down to earth\r\nI know the truth, you should know your worth\r\nWhile all your friends say you're looking fine\r\nI know that you'll never be alright"
