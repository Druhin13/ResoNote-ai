  "lyrics": "I'll make a reckless prediction\r\nI'll still be in the kitchen\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nI think we'll probably be good\r\nIf stuff is still where it stood\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nWe won't remember each other\r\nBut we'll probably recover\r\nUnless everyone's gone\r\nIt might be too soon to say this\r\nBut I think that we may just\r\nSee the lights come on\r\nSee I've been picturing diagrams\r\nOf master plans\r\nI taught myself to draw in the dust\r\nWith what remains of my left hand\r\nAnd from what I can tell\r\nI'll be no more than a shell\r\nOr an automaton\r\nBut we'll be laughing and shit\r\nIt will have been worth it\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nUnless we chicken out again\r\nWhich is exactly how we ended up in here\r\nOur guard was down\r\nWe were disarmed\r\nThey tampered with\r\nThe smoke alarm\r\nThere won't be any more trouble\r\nYou'll be dragged from the rubble\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nAnd I'll be looking so great\r\nI will have lost some weight\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nWe will be growing mustaches\r\nOnce we're raised from the ashes\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nWe'll be encased in gold\r\nDesiccated and old\r\nWhen the lights come on\r\nSee I've been picturing Diagrams\r\nOf master plans\r\nI taught myself to draw in the dust\r\nWith what remains of my left hand\r\nAnd from what I can tell\r\nGroping around\r\nThere's something else\r\nI feel a face\r\nI feel a pulse\r\nI think I'm tripping\r\nSomething's got me by the hair\r\nLet's table this discussion\r\nUntil my concussion\r\nOn the bottom stair\r\nUnless I pass out once again\r\nAnd find the bandage where my kidney used to be\r\nKnocked over lamp\r\nSome broken plates\r\nPrescription pads for opiates"
