  "lyrics": "No you don't wanna stick around\r\nI'll make heads roll when shit goes down\r\nThought you got out by skippin' town\r\nAs if I'd let you live it down, live it down\r\nAnd when I look back\r\nOn all my choices\r\nYou tried to silence\r\nThose unheard voices\r\nI never thought you'd turn on me\r\nBut that's what you did\r\nLook at me now\r\nYou're gonna see what makes me tick\r\nWhen they made me I broke the mold\r\nCast out, and now I'm on my own\r\nIf you could see the light from here\r\nYour conscience would not be so clear\r\nTake your best shot won't shake me down\r\nAnd just forsake me now\r\nDon't be so quick to call me rogue\r\nIt wasn't pride that broke my code\r\nOne man can live by reason\r\nAnother calls it treason\r\nBut I'll decide that on my own\r\nYou want to make heard\r\nThe people's voices\r\nThen you desert me\r\nFor my own choices\r\nI never thought I'd turn\r\nMy back upon the creed\r\nBut here I stand\r\nAnd now the brotherhood will bleed\r\nWhen they made me I broke the mold\r\nCast out, and now I'm on my own\r\nIf you could see the light from here\r\nYour conscience would not be so clear\r\nTake your best shot won't shake me down\r\nAnd just forsake me now\r\nNow when you look back\r\nOn all your choices\r\nAs you are drowned out\r\nBy all of your voices\r\nMy brother but not my blood\r\nBecomes the enemy\r\nThe time I'd die for you is gone\r\nWhen they made me I broke the mold\r\nCast out, and now I'm on my own\r\nIf you could see the light from here\r\nYour conscience would not be so clear\r\nTake your best shot won't shake me down\r\nAnd just forsake me now"
