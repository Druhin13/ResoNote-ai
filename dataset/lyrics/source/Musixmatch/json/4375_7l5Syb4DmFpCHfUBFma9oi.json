  "lyrics": "I've lived a little\r\nI've loved a lot\r\nI lost myself to you\r\nWe tied our dreams up in a lover's knot\r\nBut none of them came true\r\nMy solid ground soon turned to quicksand\r\nThe warm winds turned to frost\r\nWhere does love go?\r\nWhen it has no plan?\r\nWhen everything is lost?\r\nThe only thing that I forgot\r\nWas that we walk alone\r\nI'm learning how to stand again\r\nA steady hand again\r\nI'm gonna be ok\r\nI'm gonna be just fine\r\nI'm gonna be alright now (alright now)\r\nI'm gonna make a break\r\nI'm gonna take my time\r\nI'm gonna be alright now (alright now)\r\nI'm gonna be ok\r\nI'm gonna be just fine\r\nI'm gonna be alright now (alright now)\r\nI'm gonna make a break\r\nI'm gonna take my time\r\nI'm gonna be alright now (alright now)\r\nYou said you'd love me bigger\r\nThan the universe, the sun and all the stars\r\nYou said that there was nothing that we couldn't overcome\r\nAnd yet we fell apart\r\nWe fell apart"
