  "lyrics": "I am your nightmare that won't go away\r\nI am the face you'll see on your dying day\r\nNot giving it up\r\nNot calling it quits when we're outta luck\r\nNot winding down, not fucking around\r\nJust refining the sound\r\nYou are forever caught\r\nBetween growing up\r\nAnd settling down\r\nYou'll never walk the line\r\nBetween giving up\r\nAnd laying down\r\nYou are just digging through my trash\r\nYou are within a measure of my wrath\r\nNot giving it up\r\nNot calling it quits when we're outta luck\r\nNot winding down, not fucking around\r\nJust refining the sound\r\nTo those of you who hate me, don't wait for me\r\nTo give a fuck\r\nDon't wait for me\r\nTo give a fuck\r\nYou're out here spreading lies and doubt\r\nYou've got nothing better worth talking about\r\nYou rats are always talking at my back\r\nThere's a reason you've been sitting at the back of the pack\r\nOur path has made us better\r\nOur path has made you bitter\r\nNot giving it up\r\nNot calling it quits when we're outta luck\r\nNot winding down, not fucking around\r\nJust refining the sound\r\nYou are forever caught\r\nBetween growing up\r\nAnd settling down\r\nYou'll never walk the line\r\nBetween giving up\r\nAnd laying down\r\nYou are forever caught\r\nBetween growing up\r\nAnd settling down\r\nYou'll never walk the line\r\nBetween giving up\r\nAnd laying down"
