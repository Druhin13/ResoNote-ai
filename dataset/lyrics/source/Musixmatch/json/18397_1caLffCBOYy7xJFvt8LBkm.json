  "lyrics": "These days ain't been the same\r\nOffended when they censor cams\r\nAnd gritty beards turn hipster\r\nI'll never be a nerd by chance\r\nFear those bitter in heart\r\nA little \"S\" with the two lines through it so they're living in carts\r\nBoolean with the truth and I'm used to suspect behavior\r\nEnough dead already, who saved ya?\r\nRoll dice try to beat the problems\r\nFactual, fat chance you defeat the odds\r\nBackhanded backgammon with the cost of life\r\nAn actual blind mice, lost in front of the answer\r\nSinking at the bottom of the sea, man\r\nUh, bukkake\r\nS'why I, Miyagi the beat pad and flee past lines\r\nThat've been drawn in the sand\r\nStay preachin', ain't lose defense\r\nOooooh\r\n(Yeah, nobody's taking my side in here)\r\nSomewhere along the way I lost myself\r\nYeah, I lost myself (I lost myself)\r\nI lost myself\r\nSomewhere along the way it cost my health\r\nYeah, it cost my health (it cost my health)\r\nIt cost my health\r\nAll these voices in my head won't go away\r\nThey've built a paradise, it's my novocaine\r\nSo numb to the soul casing\r\nI can't feel anything, I'm black and blue, shaking\r\nOooooh\r\nI'm black and blue, shaking\r\nOooooh\r\nI'm black and blue, shaking\r\nâ™ª\r\nAnybody here? Anything inside?\r\nOh, I'm afraid of it\r\nClose the blinds, mmm\r\nIn a stairway, stuck inside\r\nI hear the doorbell ring\r\nLook out the blinds, who is it?\r\nYeah, I think I lost my headspace\r\nBlack, white, that's how death tastes\r\nI'm getting real sick of my desk\r\nClock ticks slow down, mother fuck a day job, who needs a nest egg\r\nYeah, yeah, I've been kicked out my nest, I guess I'll never see those bed stains\r\nAgain, all of my bags are dead weight\r\nThe meds all pouring out my likes for def things\r\nLet the creek run dry\r\nMind sleeps, while I'm hiding, I always peep one eye\r\nInternet kids, never beat my odds, so leap behind\r\nLet the creek run out\r\nMind sleeps, while my eyes steep, I always know to keep one down\r\nFrom me to me\r\nThere will always be one crown\r\nAll these voices in my head won't go away\r\nIt's my paradise, it's my novocaine\r\nI'm so numb to the soul casing\r\nI can't feel anything, I'm black and blue, shaking\r\nAll these voices in my head won't go away\r\nThey've built a paradise, it's my novocaine\r\nSo numb to the soul casing\r\nI can't feel anything, I'm black and blue, shaking\r\nOooooh\n\nI'm black and blue, shaking\r\nOooooh\n\nI'm black and blue, shaking"
