  "lyrics": "Why can't I sing a song about love?\r\nSing about something I know nothing of\r\nA kiss on the cheek, a touch of the hand\r\nMy knees feeling weak, my heart feeling grand\r\nOh why can't I sing a song about love?\r\nPerhaps I'm a dreamer who doesn't wake up\r\nI'm soaring through skies in a red magic carpet\r\nAnd I'm falling through trees with pillows for leaves\r\nI might fall but I won't skin my knees\r\nAnd if I proclaim all the nothing I've found\r\nPerhaps I am fried in and won't stick around\r\nAnd if I take courage and expose my heart\r\nThere's nothing that keep us, keep us apart\r\nOh why can't I sing?\r\nWhen our love's on the line\r\nWill my heart fall behind?\r\nForever resign to watching you cry\r\nAnd rather in you than I\r\nThat's why I can't sing\r\nOh that's why I can't sing\r\nA song about love?\r\nA song about love?\r\nA song about love?\r\nPerhaps I'm a dreamer who doesn't wake up\r\nI'm soaring through skies in a red magic carpet\r\nAnd I'm falling through trees with pillows for leaves\r\nI might fall but I won't skin my knees"
