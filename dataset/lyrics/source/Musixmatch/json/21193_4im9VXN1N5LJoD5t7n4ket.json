  "lyrics": "Blank\r\nI am sitting in a chair, in a bedroom,\r\nin a house, that I bought three years ago\r\nThe house is in the Hollywood hills\r\nMy mother is in the living room speaking with my assistants softly\r\nSoft enough that her words are\r\nblending with the other background noises\r\nLike birds, fans and the high G sharp ringing in my mind\r\nThe time is 3:23PM, the date is February 12th 2016\r\nI'm 28 years old but I won't be long\r\nMy name is Michael Robert Henry Posner\r\nFive days ago I took a lot of Psilocybin\r\n(I was alone)\r\nI experienced timelessness and I felt that my life was a lie\r\nI was scared\r\nI spoke to my friend Micky yesterday about it\r\nBy the end of the conversation I felt happy\r\nRight now I feel blank\r\nI don't mean that in a negative way\r\nI mean I feel neutral\r\nNot happy and not sad\r\nBlank\r\nI like blank\r\nWho believes in god after they've seen war?\r\nWho believes in war after they've seen god?"
