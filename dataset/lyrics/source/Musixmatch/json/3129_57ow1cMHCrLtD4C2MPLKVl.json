  "lyrics": "I can't breathe, I can't sleep, I can't take it back now\r\nThe fault is lying on me but now your fading away\r\nIts only in my sleep I hear your laugh now\r\nI need to close my eyes to feel you with me now\r\nThe fault is lying on me and I cant make it okay\r\nI can't seem to write you a love song\r\nI can't seem to tell you to stay\r\nI hope that I can figure out the words I have to say\r\nEvery time I think I might lose you\r\nIt's like you took my last breath away\r\nI hope that I can figure out the words I have to say\r\nBefore you've gone away\r\nGone, gone, gone, gone you've gone away\r\nKnow that I never caught myself here before\r\nThis is the first cause I am standing for\r\nIt's lying on me but I ain't running away\r\nBefore you make a move you may or may not regret\r\nGirl I hope you know you're the one I'll never forget\r\nI need you, I miss you and I want you here with me every day"
