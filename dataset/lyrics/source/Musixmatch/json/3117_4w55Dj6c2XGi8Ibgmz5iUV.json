  "lyrics": "Tonight's the night, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night.\r\nBruce Berry was a working man\r\nHe used to load that Econoline van.\r\nA sparkle was in his eye\r\nBut his life was in his hands.\r\nWell, late at night when the people were gone\r\nHe used to pick up my guitar\r\nAnd sing a song in a shaky voice\r\nThat was real as the day was long.\r\nTonight's the night, yes it is, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, yes it is, tonight's the night.\r\nEarly in the mornin' at the break of day\r\nHe used to sleep until the afternoon.\r\nIf you never heard him sing\r\nI guess you won't too soon.\r\n'Cause people let me tell you\r\nIt sent a chill up and down my spine\r\nWhen I picked up the telephone\r\nAnd heard that he'd died out on the mainline.\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night.\r\nBruce Berry was a working man\r\nHe used to load that Econoline van.\r\nWell, early in the morning at just about the break of day\r\nHe used to sleep until the afternoon.\r\nTonight's the night, yes it is, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night\r\nTonight's the night, tonight's the night."
