  "lyrics": "Eyes open up to the same old ceiling\r\nMind makes the heart feel the same old feeling\r\nArms start missing you once again\r\nI can feel the sin come a-creeping in\r\nTake a deep breath and I make my move\r\nWell it sure is a long walk across this dark room\r\nYeah I slept the day away 'cause my pride is gone\r\nFor the first of many on a heart of stone\r\nAnd the people that know me best\r\nKnow how I get when I'm alone\r\nI'm a bottled up tank, a reckless mess\r\nWith a fury on my own\r\nYeah I'm wasted, washed up\r\nTryna find something to believe in\r\nI'm calling all, calling all...\r\nI'm calling all demons\r\nWell the sun disappeared when she walked away\r\nIt's five long years digging my own grave\r\nNowhere to go, no one around\r\nHer marriage like a hammer, just beats me down\r\nOh and the people that know me best\r\nKnow how I get when I'm alone\r\nI'm a bottled up tank, a reckless mess\r\nWith a fury on my own\r\nYeah I'm wasted, washed up\r\nI'm tryna find something to believe in\r\nI'm calling all, calling all...\r\nI'm calling all demons\r\nHatred, blame, greed and lust\r\nFallen angels and broken trust\r\nDon't dare judge what you don't understand\r\n'Cause there's way more to me that this broken man\r\nAnd the people that know me best\r\nKnow how I get when I'm alone\r\nI'm a bottled up tank, a reckless mess\r\nWith a fury on my own\r\nYeah I'm wasted, washed up\r\nI'm tryna find something to believe in\r\nI'm calling all, calling all...\r\nYeah I'm calling all, calling all...\r\nWhoa, I'm calling all demons\r\nYes I'm calling all demons\r\nOh, here they come\r\nYeah here they come\r\nCalling all demon"
