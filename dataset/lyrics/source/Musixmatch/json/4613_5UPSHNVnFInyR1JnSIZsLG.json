  "lyrics": "A fire in the sky\r\nAblaze the spark, beyond the stars\r\nIts gleaming wings will cut their way\r\nThrough the silent paths of space\r\nPlanets whirl, suns are lit\r\nMountains fly, stars are dimmed\r\nIts golden sabres, tear through time\r\nIn the night of the river of death\r\nFly the silent prince electors\r\nOn the banks of Tuonela\r\nBleach the skeletons of kings\r\nTheir skulls of sugar sickly sweet\r\nTheir bones piled up on the shore\r\nOn bed of mottled rocks\r\nAmid flowers cold as ice\r\nPray the weak, the old, the poor\r\nAnd when the tiny one from Heaven comes\r\nCrawls inside the chosen skull\r\nAnd when the tiny one it summons the others\r\nTo crawl inside the chosen skull\r\nThey build their castles in the heads of kings\r\nBring life to the empty halls\r\nThey build their castles in the heads of kings\r\nAnd honey will flow once more\r\nOnce more\r\nâ™ª\r\nIn the night of the river of death\r\nFly the silent prince electors\r\nAnd when the tiny one from Heaven comes\r\nCrawls inside the chosen skull\r\nAnd when the tiny one it summons the others\r\nTo crawl inside the chosen skull\r\nThey build their castles in the heads of kings\r\nBring life to the empty halls\r\nThey build their castles in the heads of kings\r\nAnd honey will flow once more\r\nOnce more"
