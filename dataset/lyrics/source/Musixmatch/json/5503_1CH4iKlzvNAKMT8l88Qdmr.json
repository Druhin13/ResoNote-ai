  "lyrics": "Waking up on the floor with no one else in the room\r\nI never felt like this before, I just hope I'm leaving soon\r\nAnd if tomorrow I don't wake up, just know I really tried\r\nTo make the best of your forgiveness\r\nTell me one last time how I never tried\r\nWas so close to breaking through last time\r\nI thought that I'd be sheltered by nothingness\r\nBy the lack of consciousness\r\nBut I lay here awake, too afraid to dream\r\n'Cause if I might have to face myself\r\nI'll buckle at my knees\r\nTell me one last time how I never tried\r\nâ™ª\r\nI've seen the light, but never felt this close\r\nPushed my pain aside, 'cause I could never give it to those\r\n'Cause I never see the point in sharing defeat\r\nDisplaying my debts to the world\r\nI just live in repeat, vacant and desperate\r\nTell me one last time how I never tried\r\nAnd if tomorrow I don't wake up\r\nJust know I really tried to make the best of your forgiveness\r\nAnd tell my brother he'll be fine"
