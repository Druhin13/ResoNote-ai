  "lyrics": "When I wake up in the morning\r\nThe first thing I do before I eat my bacon\r\nPick up my guitar and turn the volume up\r\nFollowing my dreams\r\nSet your spirits free\r\nJam we can make believe\r\nSing along and play along whatever you please\r\nJam set your spirits free\r\nCruisin' in my car or driving in traffic\r\nI'm listening to Southborder\r\nI am a fanatic\r\nWhen I'm in the office I turn the radio on\r\nFollowing my dreams\r\nSet your spirits free\r\nJam we can make believe\r\nSing along and play along whatever you please\r\nJam set your spirits free\r\nâ™ª\r\nAfter the dinner, before I go to sleep\r\nI wash my face and of course I brush my teeth\r\nTurn the lights off and turn my radio on\r\nFollowing my dreams\r\nSet your spirits free\r\nJam we can make believe\r\nSing along and play along whatever you please\r\nJam set your spirits free\r\nJam we can make believe\r\nSing along and play along whatever you please\r\nJam set your spirits free\r\nAnd follow your dreams"
