  "lyrics": "The way your head takes the shape\r\nOf the pillow you've been sleepin' on\r\nThat stubborn look on your face\r\nWhen you just won't admit you're wrong\r\nAll your crazy mismatched puzzle pieces\r\nAre just a couple of the million reasons\r\nWhy I just don't want you girl, I need you\r\nYou're hard to define\r\nI thank God you're mine\r\n'Cause there's nobody built like you\r\nGot that \"I don't care who's watchin'\" kinda attitude\r\nFrom the sweet Georgia smile\r\nTo the way that you move\r\nIt's yours all along, baby, you got your own kind of beautiful\r\nâ™ª\r\nThe way you still see the good in me even when I'm hard to take\r\nThe way you handle the sticks\r\nAnd the stones but you still don't break\r\nEven though I've barely scratched the surface\r\nThere's always something new from you I'm learning\r\nI can't wait to flip the next page, turn it, see what comes around\r\nLookin' at you now\r\nThere's nobody built like you\r\nGot that \"I don't care who's watchin'\" kinda attitude\r\nFrom the sweet Georgia smile\r\nTo the way that you move\r\nIt's yours all along, baby, you got your own kind of beautiful, yeah\r\nThe way that you wear those wild clothes\r\nYour favourite band's Collective Soul\r\nHow you don't even even know, you're one of a kind\r\nThe way that you laugh at your own jokes\r\nPut lemon in your cherry-coke\r\nI'll never ever let you go, no, no, no\r\nNobody built like you\r\nGot that \"I don't care who's watchin'\" kinda attitude\r\nFrom that sweet Georgia smile\r\nTo the way that you move\r\nIt's yours all along, baby, you got your own kind of beautiful\r\nYour own kind of beautiful\r\nThe way that you wear those wild clothes\r\nYour favourite band's Collective Soul\r\nPut lemon in your cherry-coke\r\nYour own kind of beautiful"
