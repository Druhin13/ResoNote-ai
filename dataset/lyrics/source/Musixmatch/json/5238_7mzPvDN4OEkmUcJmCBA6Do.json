  "lyrics": "Another head hangs lowly\r\nChild is slowly taken\r\nCan violence cause such silence?\r\nWho are we mistaken\r\nBut you see, it's not me\r\nIt's not my family\r\nIn your head, in your head they are fighting\r\nWith their tanks and their bombs\r\nAnd their Gods, and their guns\r\nIn your head, in your head they are dying\r\nIn your head, in your head\r\nZombie, zombie, zombie\r\nIt's in your head, in your head\r\nZombie, zombie, zombie\r\nAnother mother's breaking heart is taken over\r\nWhen violence causes silence we must be mistaken\r\nIt's the same old theme\r\nSince 1916\r\nIn your head, in your head they are fighting\r\nWith their tanks and their bombs\r\nAnd their Gods, and their guns\r\nIn your head, in your head they are dying\r\nIn your head, in your head\r\nZombie, zombie, zombie\r\nIt's in your head, in your head\r\nZombie, zombie, zombie"
