  "lyrics": "Look what you started\r\nFeeling discarded\r\nToo open-hearted\r\nFeelings disregarded\r\nAnd I am caught up\r\nAnd you're calling me\r\nAs we slide all the way down\n\nAnd I've been caught up\r\nAnd you're calling me\r\nAs we're pearls to the ground\n\nSo take a breath and look at me now\r\nI-I-I'll let you know\r\nWhen the Pearls on my neck get too tight, I'll let go\r\nAt least I could leave you\r\nI wouldn't, I need you\r\nAnd if I could shake you\r\nI wouldn't, I'd take you down\n\nSay you don't like it\r\nWhen I ignite it\r\nYou try to fight it\r\nBut I know you get excited\r\nWhen you take hold of my hips\r\nI insist, please slide it all the way down\r\nAnd I've been bitin' my lips\r\nI insist, we smother onto the ground\r\nâ™ª\r\nSo take a breath and look at me now\r\nSo take a breath and look at me now\r\nI-I-I'll let you know\r\nWhen the Pearls on my neck get too tight, I'll let go\r\nAt least I could leave you\r\nI wouldn't, I need you\r\nAnd if I could shake you\r\nI wouldn't, I'd take you down\n\nI-I-I'll let you know\r\nWhen the Pearls on my neck get too tight, I'll let go\r\nAt least I could leave you\r\nI wouldn't, I need you\r\nAnd if I could shake you\r\nI wouldn't, I'd take you down\r\nD-D-Down\r\nD-D-Down"
