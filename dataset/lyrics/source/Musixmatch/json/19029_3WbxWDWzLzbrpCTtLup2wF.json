  "lyrics": "Gotta, gotta fear of missing you\r\nGotta, gotta fear of missing you\r\nBeen living out of aeroplanes, rental cars, and trains\r\nJust spent a year in Nashville\r\nI'm really sick some days\r\nI run my places in pencil\r\nIt all seems to change\r\nBut when I get your number\r\nYou started to change things\r\nI've been waiting all day to call you\r\nWhat can I do? What can I do?\r\nWhen my feet are in California\r\nBut my head is with you\r\nI don't want to let you go\r\nI don't want to lose this feeling\r\nI lose you dreaming\r\nI gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,\r\ngotta, gotta, figure this out, figure this out\r\nI gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,\r\ngotta, gotta, figure this out, figure this out son\r\nCause I'm afraid of missing you\r\nFeels like I'm always running\r\nTo beat the hourglass\r\nBut baby if you're coming\r\nYou know my bags are packed\r\nWe can meet at Heathrow\r\nI'll be at Gate fix A\r\nI'll try and be your hero\r\nWhile chasing down this train\r\nI've been waiting all day to call you\r\nWhat can I do? What can I do?\r\nWhen my feet are in Barcelona\r\nBut my head is with you\r\nI don't want to let you go\r\nI don't want to lose this feeling\r\nI lose you dreaming\r\nI gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,\r\ngotta, gotta, figure this out, figure this out\r\nI gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,\r\ngotta, gotta, figure this out, figure this out son\r\nCause I'm afraid of missing you\r\nIt could be four days\r\nOr 45 minutes\r\nBut it's not my place\r\nWithout you in it\r\nBeen wishing you were here\r\nBut I'm still innocent\r\nPostcards and Polaroids\r\nPostcards and Polaroids\r\nI don't want to let you go\r\nI don't want to lose this feeling\r\nI lose you dreaming\r\nI gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,\r\ngotta, gotta, figure this out, figure this out\r\nI gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta,\r\ngotta, figure this out, figure this out son\r\nCause I'm afraid of missing you\r\nCause I'm afraid of missing you"
