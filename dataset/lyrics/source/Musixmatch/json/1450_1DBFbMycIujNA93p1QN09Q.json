  "lyrics": "One, two, three, four\r\n♪\r\nBefore we get started it I'll clean this up\r\nNo use drinking from a leaking cup\r\nYou know what I mean?\r\nNot really, it seems\r\nAnd when we get going, we'll keep it saying\r\nChanges as good as a holiday\r\nI'm not claiming I'm some patron saint\n\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\r\nAll of what I got I give it all away\r\n♪\r\nWalkin' on eggshells gets tiring and\r\nPulling teeth, white-knuckling\r\nAnd I don't wanna hurt your feelings\r\nSo I say nothing\r\nA sort of self-righteous, my heart of gold\r\nJust sit back, do what you're told\r\nIf you spot it, you got it\r\nWell, maybe I got it too\r\n♪\r\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\r\nAll of what I got I give it all away\r\n♪\r\nAnd it goes\r\nAnd it goes\r\nYeah, it goes away\r\nSay what you need to...\r\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\r\nAll of what I got I give it all away\n\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\r\nAll of what you got you throw it all away"
