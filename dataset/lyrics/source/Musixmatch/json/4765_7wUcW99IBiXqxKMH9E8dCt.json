  "lyrics": "Over, over, over\r\nYou said that you don't like how I dress\r\nNow you don't like my new friends\r\n(No, no, no)\r\nAnd you tell me that I'm losing myself\r\nBut I won't let you in again\r\n(No, no, no)\r\n'Cause I know how you work and you'll be gone in a minute\r\nYou only ever care about the story when you're in it\r\nAnd I don't need a reason\r\nTake a hint from me\r\nI don't wanna be rude\r\nI don't wanna be rude\r\nStop getting on my case\r\nDon't you even say my name\r\nYou were the one who didn't care\r\nI am the one you left here\r\nStuck in the corner of the place we used to love\r\nBut now I don't think about you anymore\r\nI won't shed a tear\r\nNot over you\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNot over you\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nYou're saying that you want me back\r\n'Cause you're afraid to lose control\r\n(No, no, no)\r\nBut I can't move when you're holding my hand\r\nIt's time for you to let it go\r\n(No, no, no)\r\n'Cause I don't need a reason\r\nTake a hint from me\r\nI don't wanna be rude\r\nI don't wanna be rude\r\nStop getting on my case\r\nDon't you even say my name\r\nYou were the one who didn't care\r\nI am the one you left here\r\nStuck in the corner of the place we used to love\r\nBut now I don't think about you anymore\r\nI won't shed a tear\r\nNot over you\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNot over you\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nAnd I cried for you for ninety-two days\r\nBut what did you do?\r\nIt didn't matter to you\r\n(Over, over)\r\nBut I made it out so leave me alone\r\nTake a clue\r\nDo I have to be rude?\r\nStop getting on my case\r\nDon't you even say my name\r\nYou were the one who didn't care\r\nI am the one you left here\r\nStuck in the corner of the place we used to love\r\nBut now I don't think about you anymore\r\nI won't shed a tear\r\nNot over you\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNot over you\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNot over you\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNot over you\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNot over you\r\n(Over, over, over)\r\nNo, no, no\r\n(Over, over, over)"
