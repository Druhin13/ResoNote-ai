  "lyrics": "It's been a long and twisted highway\r\nThrough so many setting suns\r\nI couldn't settle down and plant my feet upon the ground\r\nThere was always so much to be done\r\nOh my fingers how they bled\r\nFrom gripping on so tight for so long\r\nMy calloused hands had cracked so deep\r\nCracks when right on down to the bone\r\nThen I gazed and I was so amazed\r\nOh I've been so blind I could not see what was right in front of me\r\nCan you hear my heartbeat it pounds on just like a drum\r\nI've been frozen in my tracks but my spirits fire in the sun\r\nAnd where do I go off to now\r\nI'm trying so hard to grow\r\nWith each new situation\r\nI'm challenging my hesitation\r\nTrying to fulfill this life I'm living\r\nAnd accept that things are changing\r\nLet go of what drags me down and useless information\r\nAnd oh my fingers how they bled\r\nFrom gripping on so tight for so long\r\nAnd then I let my spirit fly away\r\nto see from a different point of view\r\nAnd then I gazed and I was so amazed\r\nOh I've been so blind I could not see what was right in front of me\r\nCan you hear my heartbeat it pounds on just like a drum\r\nI've been frozen in my tracks but my spirits fire in the sun"
