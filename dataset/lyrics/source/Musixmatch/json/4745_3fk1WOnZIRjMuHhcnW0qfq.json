  "lyrics": "The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations\r\nA mantle passed from warrior to warrior\r\nI am the king, I am the chief\r\nI am the leader that's fighting for peace\r\nYou see the squad, I got the keys\r\nThere is no surrender, we will not leave\r\nSo when I'm callin', they rally the troops\r\nWe have defeated some valiant groups\r\nYou got a problem, I'm grabbin' the suit\r\nAnd I'm slashin' everyone attackin' the crew\r\nThat is the truth, you are too long in the tooth\r\nLook at the weapons you choose, you're gonna lose\r\nLook at your primitive tools\r\nNo matter how much you shoot\r\nI'm bulletproof, my entire body's covered\r\nFrom head to the shoes\r\nYour entire body's battered and bruised\r\nDon't be confused, T'Challa's in the building setting the rules\r\nWe are a mighty nation\r\nCan conquer any foe\r\nSit on highest places\r\nOn top of land of gold\r\nYou do not want to face us\r\nWatch out inside the zone\r\nBow down, whoa\r\nBow down, whoa\r\nBow to the king, respect my throne\r\nYeah, we're here now, don't be scared now\r\nY'all know we 'bout to tear this down\r\nYeah, we're here now, don't be scared now\r\nY'all know we 'bout to tear this down\r\nYeah, you think I'm playing with y'all, I got vibranium claws\r\nYou know I'm laying the low, I'll put face to the floor\r\nYou better pray to your god\r\nWe will not wait anymore\r\nMaking our way through the door\r\nI know you hatin' for sure\r\nAll of you better get out of the way, it ain't safe anymore\r\nI got the juice\r\nI will be the victor, you are the loser\r\nI'm not amused, by your foolish and irrelevant views\r\nLook at the news\r\nEarth is a bomb, that needs to defuse\r\nWhat do you do? Killin' the enemy, you better choose us\r\nMy suit energy is kinetic\r\nWhatever you dishin', I throw it back\r\nYou and your team is pathetic\r\nWe on a mission, no holding back\r\nWe are the biggest, how cold is that?\r\nRepresenting my people with honor\r\nThrow up a peace, and I won't attack\r\nIntroducing the world to Wakanda\r\nWe are a mighty nation\r\nCan conquer any foe\r\nSit on highest places\r\nOn top a land of gold\r\nYou do not want to face us\r\nWatch out inside the zone\r\nBow down, whoa\r\nBow down, whoa\r\nBow to the king, respect my throne\r\nYeah, we're here now, don't be scared now\r\nY'all know we 'bout to tear this down\r\nYeah, we're here now, don't be scared now\r\nY'all know we 'bout to tear this down"
