Feel frozen\r\nOh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, think I'm running out of time\r\nOh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, I'm just tryna stay alive\r\nAnd I need some air, it's my only prayer, oh-oh\r\n'Cause I can't breathe (whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't breathe (oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)\r\nAnd I need some air (whoa-oh, whoa-yeah, whoa-oh)\r\nIt's my-my-my-my only prayer (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't breathe (whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't (I can't)\r\nI need some hope, before I choke\r\nBefore I'm sorry\r\nInhale your love, to fill my lungs\r\nTo fill my body\r\nOh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, think I'm running out of time\r\nOh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, I'm just tryna stay alive\r\nAnd I need some air, it's my only prayer (oh-whoa-oh)\r\n'Cause I can't breathe (whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah, I can't breathe (oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)\r\nAnd I need some air (whoa-oh)\r\nIt's my only prayer (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)\r\n'Cause I can't breathe (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't breathe (whoa-oh)\r\nI got a hole in my chest, the water's up to my neck\r\nIt seems the older I get, the more that I stress, Lord knows\r\nIf I'm doing my best, but I keep losing my breath\r\nPlease don't let me drown\r\n(Oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh)\n\n(Oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh)\r\n(I can't)\r\n'Cause I can't (whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't breathe (whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh)\r\n'Cause I can't breathe (whoa-oh, whoa-yeah, whoa-oh)\r\n'Cause I can't breathe (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't breathe (oh-whoa-oh)\r\nYeah, I can't"
