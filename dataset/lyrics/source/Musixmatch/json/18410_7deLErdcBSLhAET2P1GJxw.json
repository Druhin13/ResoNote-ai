  "lyrics": "There's something happening here\r\nWhat it is ain't exactly clear\r\nThere's a man with a gun over there\r\nTelling me I've got to beware\r\nThink it's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?\r\nThere's battle lines being drawn\r\nNobody's right if everybody's wrong\r\nYoung people speaking their minds\r\nGetting so much resistance from behind\r\nIt's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?\r\nIt's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?\r\nWhat a field day for the heat\r\nA thousand people in the street\r\nSinging songs and carrying signs\r\nMostly saying, \"hooray for our side\"\r\nIt's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?\r\nIt's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?\r\nParanoia strikes deep\r\nInto your life it will creep\r\nIt starts when you're always afraid\r\nStep out of line, the men come and take you away\r\nIt's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?\r\nIt's time we stop\r\nChildren, what's that sound?\r\nEverybody look what's going down?"
