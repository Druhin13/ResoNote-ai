I forget it all\r\nAll of my dreams and every nightmare\r\nAll of my teeth could've fallen out my mouth but\r\nI... I forget it all\r\nSo tell me why i cant forget you no\r\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\r\nYou're getting in my head\r\nAnd getting me upset again\r\nI need a mind eraser\r\nI used to dip, I did the \"Electric Slide\"\r\nThe \"Macarena\", learned it when I was only nine\r\nAnd I forget it all\r\n\"Down down baby\" and \"Mary Mack\"\r\nI wanna play along but I'm drawing a blank, yeah\r\nI... I forget it all\r\nSo tell me why i cant forget you no\r\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\r\nYou're getting in my head\r\nAnd getting me upset again\r\nI need a mind eraser\r\nOh my my, mind eraser\r\nOh my my, I need a mind eraser\r\nI want a way to black it out baby\r\nFind me a way to wash it all away\r\nI want a way to black it out baby\r\nAll you gotta do is slip my mind\r\nSo tell me why i cant forget you no\r\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\r\nYou're getting in my head\r\nAnd getting me upset again\r\nI need a mind eraser\r\nSo tell me why i cant forget you no\r\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\r\nYou're getting in my head\r\nAnd getting me upset again\r\nI need a mind eraser\r\nMind eraser, mind eraser\r\nMind eraser, mind eraser\r\nMind eraser, mind eraser\r\nMind eraser, mind eraser"
