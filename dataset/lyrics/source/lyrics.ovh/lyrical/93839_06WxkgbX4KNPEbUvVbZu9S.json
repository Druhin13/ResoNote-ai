  "lyrics": "At my gate I'll always greet you\r\nAt my door you’re welcome in\r\nThere can be no transgression\r\nAs a means to an end\r\nOn the wind the wolves are howling\r\nHelping arms are closed in fear\n\nHelping hands are clenched in anger\n\nBroken hearts beyond repair\n\n\n\nEverything's so great can't get better, makes me wanna cry\n\nThat I’ll go out howling at the moon tonight\n\n\n\nThere she stands, so tall and mighty\n\nWith her keen and watchful eye\n\nAnd the heart of a mother\n\nHolding out her guiding light\n\nIt's a hard road to travel\n\nSolid rock from end to end\n\nThe sun, it rises on her brow\n\nAnd sets upon [the?] great expanse\n\n\n\nEverything's so great can't get better, makes me wanna cry\n\nThat I'll go out howling at the moon tonight\n\n\n\nThere she stands, so tall and mighty\n\nHer gaze facing the east\n\nAt her back our doors are closing\n\nAs we grin and bare our teeth\n\nOn the wind the wolves are howling\n\nShe cries [to?] draw near\n\nTurn around, turn around my darling\n\nOh, the wolves are here\n\n\n\nEverything's so great can't get better, makes me wanna cry\n\nThat I'll go out howling at the moon tonight\n\nYeah I’ll go out howling at the moon tonight"
