  "lyrics": "Lost on my own\r\nIn search of something real\r\nHow cruel to be exposed\r\nTo everything that I can’t touch but still feel\r\nHow'd I end up here?\n\nSo uncomfortable\n\nI'm a stranger in this body\n\nThe world's an ugly place\n\nAnd that's a fact that fate has brought me\n\nI had to disappear\n\nSo it would all just go away\n\nNow the end is drawing near\n\nAnd God I wish you would've stayed\n\n\n\nIt cuts deep cause our hearts are still attached\n\nA deadly touch spreads an itch that can't be scratched\n\nSometimes I wish it would all just fade to black\n\nI can't go back\n\n\n\nNow I'm lost on my own\n\nIn search of something real\n\nHow cruel to be exposed\n\nTo everything that I can’t touch but still feel\n\nLost on my own\n\nThey'll never understand\n\nHow tragic to suppose\n\nThat I almost held the world in my hands\n\n\n\nA captive beauty queen\n\nSo untouchable\n\nIn the town that has disowned me\n\nNice guys finish last\n\nAnd that's a fact that she has shown me\n\n\n\nHe made the cut but she deserves a better man\n\nI won't rust like the liars and letterman\n\nHedge my bets 'cuz it can't hurt to pretend\n\nUntil the end\n\n\n\nNow I'm lost on my own\n\nIn search of something real\n\nHow cruel to be exposed\n\nTo everything that I can’t touch but still feel\n\nLost on my own\n\nThey'll never understand\n\nHow tragic to suppose\n\nThat I almost held the world in my hands\n\n\n\nSo tell the town below\n\nAs death took hold\n\nYou watched helplessly\n\nTo hell with letting go\n\nCause when it snows\n\nIt falls to you from me\n\nIt falls to you from me\n\n\n\nLost on my own\n\nIn search of something real\n\nHow cruel to be exposed\n\nTo everything that I can’t touch but still feel\n\nLost on my own\n\nThey'll never understand\n\nHow tragic to suppose\n\nThat I almost held the world in my hands\n\n\n\nTo hell with letting go\n\nCause when it snows\n\nIt falls to you from me"
