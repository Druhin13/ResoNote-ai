  "lyrics": "Yeah it's easy to come back\r\nBut it's harder to let go\r\nI can tell by the nights and the blood in my eyes\r\nAnd the tears on my pillow\r\nSo I guess this is goodbye\r\nFall out like a petal\n\nNo more Sun in the sky, no more laugh 'til we cry\n\nNo more kissin' your freckles\n\n\n\nWhen love is gone in truth is where we hide\n\nIt's all we know, it's all we know\n\nWhen love is gone, know it'll be alright\n\nJust hold on, it's all we know\n\n\n\nWhen love is gone, gone\n\nWhen love is gone, gone\n\nWhen love is gone\n\n\n\nThere's a break in the silence\n\nTell me, did you get the message?\n\nI keep wonderin' why, 'til my mind will remind me\n\nThat life is a lesson\n\nMaybe I was all wrong\n\nI'm slowly confessin'\n\nAll my friends tell me I will be better in time\n\n\n\nWhen love is gone, in truth is where we hide\n\nIt's all we know, it's all we know\n\nWhen love is gone, know it'll be alright\n\nJust hold on, it's all we know\n\n\n\nWhen love is gone, gone\n\nWhen love is gone, gone\n\nWhen love is gone\n\n\n\nIn the city wasted\n\nTrying to paint the sky\n\nTrying to bring back the colors to these faded lines\n\nYou can call me crazy\n\nYou can call me blind\n\nBut Iâ€™m not wasting time\n\n\n\nWhen love is gone, in truth is where we hide\n\nIt's all we know, it's all we know\n\nWhen love is gone, know it'll be alright\n\nIt's all we know, so just hold on\n\n\n\nWhen love is gone, gone\n\nWhen love is gone, gone\n\nWhen love is gone"
