  "lyrics": "No use feeling sad\r\nNo use staying mad\r\nBetter when you're glad\r\nYou can be there in a heartbeat\r\nWhen it's close enough for jazz\r\nClose enough for jazz\n\n\n\nBe glad with what you have\n\nEven if it's half\n\nEmpty in the glass\n\nIf there's room to move your elbows\n\nThen it's close enough for jazz\n\nClose enough for jazz\n\n\n\nWhen you're not in a hurry\n\nWhen things may turn around\n\nNever give in to worry\n\nTry looking up not down, don't frown\n\n\n\nClose enough for jazz\n\nIs it persil is it daz?\n\nWell it doesn't really matter\n\nWhen it's better on the inside\n\nAnd it's close enough for jazz\n\nClose enough for jazz\n\nClose enough for jazz\n\nClose enough for jazz, oh yeah"
