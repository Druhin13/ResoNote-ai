  "lyrics": "I remember \nhow the darkness doubled \nI recall \nlightning struck itself. \nI was listening \nlistening to the rain \n\nI was hearing \n\nhearing something else. \n\n\n\nLife in the hive puckered up my night, \n\nthe kiss of death, the embrace of life. \n\nThere I stand neath the Marquee Moon \n\nJust waiting, \n\nHesitating... \n\nI ain't waiting \n\n\n\nI spoke to a man \n\ndown at the tracks. \n\nI asked him \n\nhow he don't go mad. \n\nHe said \"Look here junior, don't you be so happy. \n\nAnd for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad.\" \n\n\n\nWell a Cadillac \n\nit pulled out of the graveyard. \n\nPulled up to me \n\nall they said get in. \n\nThen the Cadillac \n\nit puttered back into the graveyard. \n\nAnd me, \n\nI got out again."
