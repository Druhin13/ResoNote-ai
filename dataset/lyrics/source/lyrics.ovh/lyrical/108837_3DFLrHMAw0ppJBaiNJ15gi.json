Lee sleeping in my family tree without a hammock\n\nThat's why my middle name is Edward just like all my cousins damn it\n\nI was country before country was some clothes in a closet\n\nLiving on a chicken farm, making Kool Aid up out of the faucet\n\nAnd daddy jammed Hank and mama Farrah Fawcett\n\nI was handling roosters when I was shitting in diapers\n\nAnd I don't care about how you roll in them rocking mud tires\n\nI drive through the creek in a fucking van that I hotwired\n\nDirty dirty baby I'm your daddy's nightmare with an attitude\n\nI'm rolling up in thunderstorms and blaring 90s country tunes\n\nAnd she can settle for a burger and grape snow cone\n\nBut she wanna run from the cops and smoke on that ganja\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm a Dixie flag waving in the bed of my truck\n\nScreaming Country Boy Can Survive (Yes sir)\n\nYeah I'm true to my roots, I keep some dirt on my boots\n\nMy whiskey cup full of southern pride (That's right)\n\nBorn and raised in the woods, always smoking on bud\n\nHard for everything I got\n\nI keep some twang in my soul, and a mouth full of Skoal\n\n'Cause it's the redneck way of life (That's right)\n\n\n\n[?] honkey ass savages (That's right)\n\nReal redneck heater from the south, I stay packing (Ha!)\n\nWhite trash, uppercutting, throwing jabs at 'em\n\nSeeing faces in my camo, I'm starting to follow patterns\n\nMotherfucker I was born in the woods, that's all I know (Yeah)\n\nJohn Deere Cadillac running them back hoes\n\nFighting chickens in the booger, bottom on bar crow (Ha!)\n\nCutting pigs, popping squirrels, and flipping 'em cane poles\n\nSkinning dear out of [?] 'cause I'm still,\n\nThe same old country motherfucker who brings the pain (That's right)\n\nAnd all I need, I keep it tight, deep down in my soul\n\nSometimes we let it blow on them back roads, you hear me now\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm a Dixie flag waving in the bed of my truck\n\nScreaming Country Boy Can Survive (Yes sir)\n\nYeah I'm true to my roots, I keep some dirt on my boots\n\nMy whiskey cup full of southern pride (That's right)\n\nBorn and raised in the woods, always smoking on bud\n\nHard for everything I got\n\nI keep some twang in my soul, and a mouth full of Skoal\n\n'Cause it's the redneck way of life (That's right)"
