  "title": "No One's Easy to Love",
  "lyrics": "Yes, there were jerks recalling the years of lost past\r\nAs you opened the door and told me how you love me so much\r\nThe resistance to feeling's something that you’ve put down before\r\nBut keep quiet if it has, you could not face it anymore\r\nToo much has changed, I can't let you walk in in the night\n\nI wish away my love, leave with the dawn\n\nActing as if all the pain in the world was my fault\n\nLeave me here, my love, don't say goodbye\n\n\n\nNo one’s easy to love\n\nDon't look down, my dear, don't be surprised\n\nNo one's easy to love\n\nDon't look back, my dear, just say you tried\n\n\n\nThere was a question you asked, \"Is your father a man?\"\n\nNo, but I think you should do ask of yourself the same\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between now and then? I'm not sure\n\nProve me wrong, my dear, don't say I lied\n\n\n\nNo one's easy to love\n\nDon’t look down, my dear, don’t be surprised\n\nNo one's easy to love\n\nDon’t look back, my dear, just say you tried"
