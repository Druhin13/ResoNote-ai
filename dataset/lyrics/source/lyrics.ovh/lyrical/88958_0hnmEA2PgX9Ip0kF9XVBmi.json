  "lyrics": "To your hands I give you\r\nAboard from Hawaii\r\nThe ship they call Northern Lights\r\nA fugitive, one of three highway man\r\nWho stopped the Pixley train at night\r\nAbout 8 PM, 22 February\n\nWe force seven thousand in gold\n\nTwo were killed in the melee\n\nA fireman of the train\n\nAnd a passenger from Modesto\n\nThe leader was an insurance agent, this I know\n\nThe third man set for remote islands near the equator\n\n\n\nWhen he found the ship\n\nWould not put in there\n\nThere's a reason to believe he set her on fire\n\nWhen our bomb exploded\n\nBuckshot unloaded\n\nWe three made off in dire\n\nTo the Right Honorable\n\nAmerican council\n\nTo the Hawaiian king\n\nI swear before notary\n\nTo make a clean breast\n\nOf the whole thing\n\nIn hope of salvation\n\nFor surely I'll be found before port\n\nBefore postal authorities can act\n\nI surrender myself unto the reward\n\n\n\nSince I was taken\n\nFrom the Napa asylum\n\nAnd put on a whaler for my own good\n\nI told the captain\n\nNot to let me ashore\n\nExcept under guard\n\nIf no faith is placed\n\nIn this letter\n\nYou're letting a brigand free\n\nThe passenger coaches\n\nWere not molested\n\nViolence, I can't see"
