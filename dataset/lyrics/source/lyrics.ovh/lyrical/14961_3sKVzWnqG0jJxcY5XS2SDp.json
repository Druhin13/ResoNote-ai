  "lyrics": "If you ever feel like something\r\nIs very, very wrong\r\nWrong with life\r\nWrong with yourself\r\nI understand\r\nI have that feeling too\n\n\n\nBut in actuality\n\nThat feeling isn’t wrong\n\nThat feeling is just being human\n\nThat intense feeling inside\n\nIs the feeling of existing\n\nOf being alive\n\nOf being a person\n\n\n\nIt’s a mountain to climb\n\nIt’s a test to pass\n\nIt’s a challenge\n\nWe are ultimately worthy of\n\n\n\nAnd rather than dread\n\nOr resent this challenge\n\nWe can embrace it\n\nWe can learn from it\n\nAnd we can celebrate it\n\n\n\nLife is very intense\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s bad\n\nUnderstanding this is what partying’s all about"
