  "lyrics": "On a wednesday morning in July\r\nWe dried our tears and we said goobye\r\nAnother angel gone before her time\r\nBut she's still alive in our hearts and minds\r\nYou never know, you never know\n\nWhat you've got until it's gone\n\nBut heaven knows that when we're old\n\nShe will be forever young\n\n\n\nTonight we send an angel home\n\nSing out and celebrate her song\n\nTonight she'll go where we can't go\n\nSing out, sing out, sing out\n\n\n\nAnd there are things in life we can't explain\n\nIn the blink of an eye everything can change\n\nSo just appreciate the little things\n\n'Cause you never know what tomorrow brings\n\n\n\nYou never know, you never know\n\nWhat you've got until it's gone\n\nBut heaven knows that when we're old\n\nShe will be forever young\n\n\n\nTonight we send an angel home\n\nSing out and celebrate her song\n\nTonight she'll go where we can't go\n\nSing out, sing out, sing out\n\n\n\nThere's an empty room at home\n\nHow can the world be so damn cold?\n\nTogether we are not alone\n\n\n\nTonight we send an angel home\n\nSing out and celebrate her song\n\nTonight she'll go where we can't go\n\nSing out, sing out, sing out\n\n\n\nOn a Wednesday morning in July\n\nWe dried our tears and we said goodbye"
