  "lyrics": "All the faces you see on your way\r\nHave a story they could tell\r\nTiny traces of life’s joy and sorrow\r\nWhy can’t we treat each other well\r\nWe all have a choice we can make\n\nThere’s always a choice we can make\n\nTo help and to heal in different ways\n\nToo many are dying in vain\n\nTogether we could ease the pain\n\nIf somehow we could ease the pain\n\n\n\nIn every single language\n\nThere’s a word for love and for blame\n\nDifferent voices, cultures, and people, and places\n\nInside we’re all the same\n\n\n\nWe all have a choice we can make\n\nThere’s always a choice we can make\n\nTo help and to heal in different ways\n\nToo many are dying in vain\n\nTogether we could ease the pain\n\nIf somehow we could ease the pain\n\n\n\nWe’ve only got each other now\n\nDon’t walk away and play pretend\n\nIt might as well be you\n\nWho’s suffering tonight\n\n\n\nWe all have a choice we can make\n\nThere’s always a choice we can make\n\nTo help and to heal in different ways\n\nToo many are dying in vain\n\nTogether we could ease the pain\n\nIf somehow we could ease the pain\n\n\n\nTogether we could make a change"
