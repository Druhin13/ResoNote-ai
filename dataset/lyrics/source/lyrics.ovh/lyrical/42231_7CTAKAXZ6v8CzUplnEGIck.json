  "lyrics": "I've never been the social type\r\nBut I talk to myself every night\r\nA million voices in my head\r\nScream out the things I should've said\r\nYeah, yeah\r\nCause I'm walking awkward\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nBut that's obvious\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nAnd we get to talking\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nBut I would just bite my tongue\n\nI can tell you so much\n\nBut we both heard enough\n\nYou said I'm making you blush\n\nI bite my tongue\n\nLike a devilish curse\n\nThat you put on my words\n\nBut I love that it hurts\n\nWhenever you bite my tongue\n\nBite my tongue\n\nI've played out this scenario\n\nSo many times it's getting old\n\nJust put my weary mouth to rest\n\nSo we can talk a little less\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nCause I'm walking awkward\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nBut that's obvious\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nAnd we get to talking\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nBut I would just bite my tongue\n\nI can tell you so much\n\nBut we both heard enough\n\nYou said I'm making you blush\n\nI bite my tongue\n\nLike a devilish curse\n\nThat you put on my words\n\nBut I love that it hurts\n\nWhenever you bite my tongue\n\nBite my tongue\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nBut I would just bite my tongue\n\nI can tell you so much\n\nBut we both heard enough\n\nYou said I'm making you blush\n\nI bite my tongue\n\nLike a devilish curse\n\nThat you put on my words\n\nBut I love that it hurts\n\nWhenever you bite my tongue\n\nBite my tongue"
