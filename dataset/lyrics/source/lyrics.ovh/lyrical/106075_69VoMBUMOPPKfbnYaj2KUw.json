  "lyrics": "I don't know your heart\r\nI don't know where to begin\r\nBut I could feel you erasing the rivers I'd drawn in\r\nThe more I stood still\r\nThe faster you were running\r\nYou don't know how it feels crawling under your skin\n\nSo far, so far away\n\nDon't you know we could be\n\n\n\nHigh or Low\n\nYou never fell beneath me\n\nAnd I gave up on you, but I never forgot you\n\n\n\nI can't be your friend\n\nHold your hand while you bleed\n\n\n\nThere's nothing left to give you\n\nNothing more I need\n\nTime to let it sleep\n\nOh, the damage was real\n\nBut nothing cut me so deep I could not heal\n\n\n\nDon't you know we could be\n\nHigh or Low\n\nYou never fell beneath me\n\nAnd I gave up on you, but I never forgot you\n\n\n\nHigh or Low\n\nYou never fell beneath me\n\nAnd I gave up on you\n\nBut I never forgot"
