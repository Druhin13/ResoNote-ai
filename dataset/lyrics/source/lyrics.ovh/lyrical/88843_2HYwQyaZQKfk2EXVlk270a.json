  "lyrics": "It's got to be you reading my letter Not your hired hand I don't know how to say it no better I love you and the band Never heard rockin' like you could Howling like you can It gets me thinking of Johnny B. Goode But you know you ain't no man When I heard you play I knew your name should be changed We're all dog panicked and you are to blame Everybody ought to call you bebe le strange You look so insane We gave you a name bebe le strange I wish I knew what you're really like A touch so shy and fine But the way you move with that guitar Just gives me other signs Here's my number give me a sign Call me back if this gets through bebe, bebe, bebe, bebe I'd never say no to you When I heard your song I knew your name should be changed Everybody ought to call you bebe le strange Under my skin you've got my mind rearranged You're so insane bebe's so strange bebe le strange"
