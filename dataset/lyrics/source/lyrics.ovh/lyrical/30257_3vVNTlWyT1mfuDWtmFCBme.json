  "lyrics": "I am a lonely woman who loves you\r\nLonely, I have always been\r\nMany things have found their way between us\r\nBut none more than my loneliness\r\nWaxing, waning, always complaining\n\nAlways trying to fix what already works\n\nPining, mining for a feeling I'm not finding\n\nLooking to you to tell me what I'm worth\n\n\n\nWhen morning comes, whistling comes a bluebird\n\nWhile I try to find a will to wake\n\nMy loneliness, it blurs the days together\n\nMy loneliness, it pushes you away\n\n\n\nWorking, pursing in circles, I am searching\n\nLooking for a cure to lift me up\n\nTrying, lying just to keep myself smiling\n\nBelieving that our love is strong enough\n\n\n\nCan you still see the good inside me?\n\nOr do you see a shell of who I was?\n\nThe loneliness has grown so much it shadows\n\nYou, the only one I truly love\n\n\n\nCoping, hoping for a way of outgrowing\n\nThese thoughts that keep me in the dark\n\nMinding, finding, always such bad timing\n\nTo learn that only I can ignite the spark\n\nOnly I can lift the lonely from my heart"
