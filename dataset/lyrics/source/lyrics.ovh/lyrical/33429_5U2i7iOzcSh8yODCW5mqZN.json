  "lyrics": "Time in constant motion\r\nLike the shifting desert sands\r\nSlipping through my hands\r\nChasing down the minutes\r\nThat turn into days\r\nSeconds get shorter\n\nAs years fall away\n\nChasing down my dreams\n\nUnder borrowed light\n\nA mirage in the distance\n\nEscaping my sight\n\nDriven to live or driven apart\n\nWhat's inside us when we depart\n\nDriven to live outside of regret\n\nTime is finite, the clocks are set\n\nDriven to live or driven apart\n\nI realize my flame is burning away\n\nStarward searching I will find my way\n\nThe power of the mind ready to combust\n\nI will show you fear in a handful of dust\n\nCombust\n\nMy flame is fleeting\n\nBut I will live and learn\n\nRise and burn, Tick and Turn\n\nRise and burn\n\nTime in constant motion\n\nLike the shifting desert sands\n\nSlipping through my hands\n\nDriven to live or driven apart\n\nWhat's inside us when we depart\n\nDriven to live outside of regret\n\nTime is finite, the clocks are set\n\nDriven to live or driven apart\n\nCombust"
