  "lyrics": "These days, the good days are fewer and farther between\r\nSometimes the hard times a shadow on my my sky-blue dream\r\nI don't have much if you look through the eyes of the world\r\nOpen me up and you might find just one shinin' pearl\r\nI've got this song, a story to tell\n\nAbout the good times and bad times, heaven and hell\n\nWell it might not be pretty, or have much to say\n\nBut it's all I've got left at the end of the day\n\nIt's the one thing they can't take away\n\nI've got this song\n\n\n\nI've got a short list of good friends I can count on to answer my call\n\nAnd a long list of bad things I might not be proud of at all\n\nShow me a man who hasn't yet learned how to fall\n\nThere is a man who doesn't know much yet at all\n\n\n\nI've got this song, a story to tell\n\nAbout the good times and bad times, heaven and hell\n\nWell it might not be pretty, or have much to say\n\nBut it's all I've got left at the end of the day\n\nIt's the one thing they can't take away\n\nI've got this song\n\n\n\nI've got this song, a story to tell\n\nAbout the good times and bad times, heaven and hell\n\nWell it might not be pretty, or have much to say\n\nBut it's all I've got left at the end of the day\n\nIt's the one thing they can't take away\n\nThe one thing they can't take away\n\nI've got this song\n\nI've got this song"
