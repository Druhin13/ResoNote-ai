  "lyrics": "You're not wanting anybody wants in you\r\nI get it, all is fair\r\nBut I've been biting all my cherry hearts in two\r\nYou don't even care\r\nWon't you ever come down from the big rock I found you climbing\n\nStowing your diamonds away\n\n\n\nYou kissed me once\n\nWhen we were drunk\n\nIt left me spinning on my heels\n\nCall the devil for a deal\n\n\n\nYou kissed me once\n\nWhen we were drunk\n\nMy head went rolling on the floor\n\nPast the window, out the door\n\n\n\nOnce I said it I knew I wouldn't regret it too\n\nIt's just too much to share\n\nNow you're fading, sailing into the night\n\nTo the boy who wasn't there\n\n\n\nI'm a practical guy\n\nSometimes I do fly off the handle\n\nThinking in scandalous ways, I've never done time\n\nBut I've done the crime of wanting\n\nSomething that never could stay\n\n\n\nYou kissed me once\n\nWhen we were drunk\n\nIt left me spinning on my heels\n\nCall the devil for a deal\n\n\n\nYou kissed me once\n\nWhen we were drunk\n\nAnd now I'm nervous when we meet\n\nI got nothing under my feet\n\n\n\nYou kissed me once\n\nWhen we were drunk\n\nIt left me spinning on my heels\n\nCalled the devil for a deal\n\n\n\nYou kissed me once\n\nWhen we were drunk\n\nMy head went rolling on the floor\n\nPast the window, out the door"
