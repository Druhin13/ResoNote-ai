  "lyrics": "Born out of hell from the depths of Gomorrah\r\nPurging new graves and defiling the souls\r\nHe satiates with such vile and dark horror\r\nOmens of dread on this night of the ghouls\r\nRaising the dead up from the ground\n\nNeeds must be fed, sorcerers abound\n\n\n\nNecromancer\n\nDeath's his guiding light\n\nNecromancer\n\nStealing afterlife\n\n\n\nFeeding on flesh from the soil that was hallowed\n\nSplintered the bones and regained in his feast\n\nDanced on the grave of the pure and the righteous\n\nAs the moonlight's expelled from the eyes of the beast\n\n\n\nRaising the dead, blasphemy reigns\n\nPortents of dread thrives on remains\n\n\n\nNecromancer\n\nFeeding from the host\n\nNecromancer\n\nBlack unholy ghost\n\nNecromancer\n\nDeath's his guiding light\n\nNecromancer\n\nStealing afterlife\n\n\n\nRaising the dead, cadaver consumed\n\nSacraments said, bodies exhumed\n\n\n\nNecromancer\n\nFeeding from the host\n\nNecromancer\n\nBlack unholy ghost\n\nNecromancer\n\nDeath's his guiding light\n\nNecromancer\n\nStealing afterlife\n\n\n\nStealing afterlife\n\nDeath's his guiding light"
