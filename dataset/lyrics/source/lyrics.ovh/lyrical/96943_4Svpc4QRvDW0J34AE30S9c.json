  "lyrics": "You put all your faith in my dreams\r\nYou gave me the world that I wanted\r\nWhat did I do to deserve you?\r\nI follow your steps with my feet\r\nI walk on the road that you started\r\nI need you to know that I heard you, every word\n\n\n\nI've waited way too long to say\n\nEverything you mean to me\n\n\n\nIn case you don’t live forever, let me tell you know\n\nI love you more than you'll ever wrap your head around\n\nIn case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth\n\nI’m everything that I am because of you\n\n\n\nI, I've carried this song in my mind\n\nListen, it's echoing in me\n\nBut I haven't helped you to hear it\n\nWe, we've only got so much time\n\nI'm pretty sure it would kill me\n\nIf you didn't know the pieces of me are pieces of you\n\n\n\nI've waited way too long to say\n\nEverything you mean to me\n\n\n\nIn case you don’t live forever, let me tell you know\n\nI love you more than you’ll ever wrap your head around\n\nIn case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth\n\nI’m everything that I am because of you\n\n\n\nI have a hero whenever I need one\n\nI just look up to you and I see one\n\nI'm a man 'cause you taught me to be one\n\n\n\nIn case you don't live forever, let me tell you know\n\nI love you more than you’ll ever wrap your head around\n\nIn case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth\n\nI'm everything that I am\n\n\n\nWhoa, whoa\n\nIn case you don't live forever, let me tell you the truth\n\nAs long as I'm here as I am, so are you"
