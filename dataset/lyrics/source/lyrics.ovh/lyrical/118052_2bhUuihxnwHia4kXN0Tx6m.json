  "lyrics": "People making lists, buying special gifts\r\nTaking time to be kind to one and all\r\nIt's that time of year when good friends are near\r\nAnd you wish you could give more than just presents from a store\r\nWhy don't you give love on Christmas Day\n\nOh, even the man who has everything\n\nWould be so happy if you would bring\n\nHim love on Christmas Day\n\nNo greater gift is there than love\n\n\n\nPeople you don't know smile and nod hello\n\nEverywhere there's an air of Christmas joy\n\nIt's that once of year when the world's sincere\n\nAnd you'd like to find a way to show the things that words can't say\n\n\n\nWhy don't you give love on Christmas Day?\n\nOh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs\n\nAll need to know there's someone who cares\n\nGive love on Christmas Day\n\nNo greater gift is there than love\n\n\n\nWhat the world needs is love\n\nYes, the world needs your love\n\n\n\nWhy don't you give love on Christmas Day\n\nEvery little child on Santa's knee\n\nHas room for your love underneath the tree\n\nGive love on Christmas Day\n\nNo greater gift is there than love\n\n\n\nWhat the world needs is love\n\nYes, the world needs your love\n\nWhy don't you give love on Christmas Day?\n\nOh, even the man who has everything\n\nWould be so happy if you would bring\n\nHim love on Christmas Day\n\nNo greater gift is there than love, love, love...\n\n\n\nMerry Christmas, baby!"
