  "lyrics": "I got my bed sheets pulled right out from under me\r\nI can't keep hiding what's been underneath\r\nNo fancy covering, you get just what you see\r\nYou get, you get, you get\r\nYou get, you get, you get\n\nYou get, you get\n\n\n\nBreaking down, let the words fall from my mouth\n\nAll the things I've never shown, all the things you'd never know\n\nHear me out 'cause I never made a sound\n\nCouldn't keep it locked away, couldn't take it to the grave\n\n\n\nI was feeling empty, a feeling with uncertainty\n\nI couldn't be left inside a room with me\n\nNow I believe running only gets you where you see\n\n\n\nYou get, you get, you get\n\nYou get, you get, you get\n\nYou get, you get\n\n\n\nBreaking down, let the words fall from my mouth\n\nAll the things I never show, all the things you never know\n\nHear me out 'cause I never made a sound\n\nCouldn't keep it locked away, couldn't take it to the grave\n\n\n\nYeah, I've been careless, I've been thoughtless\n\nI know that I'm a work in progress\n\nMy heart's chaotic, empty bottles\n\nI, yeah, I just sip this drink 'til I'm alright\n\nI stay ready for anything, yeah, and I put that on anything, yeah\n\nTelling me I should let it be, nah, that ain't part of my pedigree\n\n'Cause, oh my god, they wanna bury me alive\n\nAnd I'm so gone, there ain't no saving me tonight\n\nI can't leave 'til I say what I gotta say\n\nOh, I'ma take all this dirt to my grave\n\n\n\nI never thought I'd give it all away, but I set myself free\n\nI never thought I'd give it all away, but I need you to see I'm\n\n\n\nBreaking down, let the words fall from my mouth\n\nAll the things I never show, all the things you never know\n\nHear me out 'cause I never made a sound\n\nCouldn't keep it locked away, couldn't take it to the grave"
