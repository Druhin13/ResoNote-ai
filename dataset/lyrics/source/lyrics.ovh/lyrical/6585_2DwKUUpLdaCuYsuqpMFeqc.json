  "lyrics": "You don't wanna stay 'cause you don't like my temper\r\nWhat else can I say? I wish I was better\r\nReplaying every night and every word I said\r\nSo I fill another cup just to get out of my head, oh\r\nGive it all or nothing at all\n\nCan't feel the high without the fall\n\nAnd you can't water me down, no, oh\n\n\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me now\n\nYou can't water me down\n\nIf you want all of me now\n\nAll of me, all of me\n\n\n\nYou say it's not my fault, maybe it's just the weather\n\nBut all of this you knew before we were together\n\nI tried to make it right but darling you're not worth it\n\nOh, and I don't wanna fight, we only end up hurting\n\n\n\nI try not to come off too strong\n\nEvery time you make me feel small\n\nSo you can't water me down, no, oh\n\n\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me now\n\nYou can't water me down\n\nIf you want all of me now\n\nAll of me, all of me\n\n\n\nAnd I've been trying to keep my head up\n\nLong enough to say what\n\nWhat I wanna say to you\n\nAnd I've been trying to keep my heart strong\n\nEven when you gave up\n\nThere's nothing left for me but\n\n\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me now\n\nYou can't water me down\n\nIf you want all of me now\n\nAll of me, all of me\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me now\n\nIf you want all of me, all of me\n\nYou can't water me down\n\nIf you want all of me now\n\nAll of me, all of me"
