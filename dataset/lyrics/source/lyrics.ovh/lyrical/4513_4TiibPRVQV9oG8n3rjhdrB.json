  "lyrics": "I know those eyes don't attest with\r\nPure devotion so infested\r\nI only woke to see you've rested and grown to weep\r\nHow could you leave me restless and broke\r\nLay this heavy stone my love\n\nYou didn’t have to grieve like that\n\nI know, I know, my love\n\nI didn’t want to leave like that!\n\n\n\nI know those lies show no rest when\n\nPure evoting falls like a necklace\n\nI only hoped to see you've rested and grown to weep\n\nHow could you leave me restless and broke\n\n\n\nLay this heavy stone my love\n\nYou didn’t have to grieve like that\n\nI know, I know, my love\n\nI didn’t want to leave like that!\n\nLay this heavy stone my love\n\nYou didn’t have to grieve like that\n\nI know, I know, my love\n\nI didn’t want to leave like that!"
