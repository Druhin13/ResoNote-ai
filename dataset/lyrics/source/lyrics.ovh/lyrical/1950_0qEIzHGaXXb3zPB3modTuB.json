  "lyrics": "Wanda had a baby in nineteen fifty one.\r\nThe father was stranger and a stranger was the son.\r\nCall that child James Lewis, call these rooms a home.\r\nChanging all them diapers polish all that chrome.\r\nC'mon, baby, spend the night with me\n\nAll around the schoolyard playing all the games\n\nRunning, laughing back and forth the kid with two first names\n\nStranger in the closet, lock the diary\n\nThe past is running faster singing harmony\n\nC'mon, baby, spend the night with me\n\n\n\n\"God bless this kitchen\" said the knick-knack shelf\n\n\"The dinner's almost ready Go and wash yourself\"\n\nJimmy's growing up now and Wanda's growing old\n\nThe time is growin' shorter the nights are long and cold\n\nC'mon, baby, spend the night with me\n\n\n\nSneaking in the closet and through the diary\n\nNow, don't you know all he saw was all there was to see\n\nThe whole town saw Jimmy on the six o'clock news\n\nHis brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoes\n\nC'mon, baby, spend the night with me\n\nC'mon, baby, spend the night with me"
