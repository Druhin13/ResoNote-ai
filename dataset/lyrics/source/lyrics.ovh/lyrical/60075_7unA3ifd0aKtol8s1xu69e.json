  "lyrics": "Thinking about throwin' away the key\nWhat would that mean\nFor you and me?\nWhoa\n\nWho says something of throwing away 'The me'?\n\nStill looking out\n\nOnly for myself\n\n\n\nYou've built a palace up around yourself\n\nA mansion of misery\n\nCan't train the ocean that keeps you out to sea\n\nCan't train the stuff that's running all throughout me\n\nMansion of misery\n\n\n\nStuck in a black graying sea\n\nWith nothing but some time to think\n\nMy heart it was an empty shell\n\nWith only true stories to tell\n\n\n\nYou really are something else\n\nYou really are full of yourself\n\nBy the fireplace, plated gold\n\nReturning to my father's hold\n\n\n\nI'm trapped in these negative vibes\n\nI can't seem to find the outside\n\nStaying up to watch the sunrise\n\nMy arms are alone with the sadness\n\n\n\nI'm trapped in these negative vibes\n\nI can't seem to find the outside\n\nStaying up to watch the sunrise\n\nSaid I can't find a way to unwind"
