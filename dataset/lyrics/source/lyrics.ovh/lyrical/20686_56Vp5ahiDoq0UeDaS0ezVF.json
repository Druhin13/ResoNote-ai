  "lyrics": "There's a power much bigger than hate\r\nStill lost in the urge to annihilate\r\nBut I know I will overcome this\r\nYou dragged me through the darkest days\r\nBy the skin of my teeth you restored my fate\r\nAnd I raised myself out of the ashes\n\n\n\nNow I'm alive in new light\n\nI’m alive in new light\n\nNow I'm alive in new light\n\nI am alive in new light\n\n\n\nAnd I was carrying the weight of the universe\n\nThe typical brittle perfectionist\n\nConfused by my every decision\n\nOne day I was being the hero\n\nThe next I was playing the coward\n\nBurnt out by my overreaction\n\n\n\nNow I'm alive in new light\n\nI’m alive in new light\n\nNow I'm alive in new light\n\nI am alive in new light\n\n\n\nThere were times when I thought that my heart would stop\n\nRunning for a bleak horizon\n\nLocked in my obsessions\n\nAnd now I am the raindrop\n\nI am the tulip\n\nI have learned compassion\n\n\n\nNow I'm alive in new light\n\nI’m alive in new light\n\nNow I'm alive in new light\n\nI am alive"
