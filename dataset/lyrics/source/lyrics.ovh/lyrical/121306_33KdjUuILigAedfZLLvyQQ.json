  "lyrics": "Well, it was last week\r\nAnd you ran out of the house\r\nI heard it's problematic\r\nAnd when you came back\r\nI felt you losing touch\r\nI knew you couldn't be trusted\n\n\n\nI should've known better\n\nWhen you're coming to bed at 4 in the morning\n\nShould've taken your eyes\n\nAvoiding mine as a warning\n\nAnd every time I ask you what's up\n\nBaby, you're changing the story\n\nJust so you know, that when you go\n\nI ain't begging for you back\n\n\n\nI sleep better than every\n\nNight you were lying next to me\n\nDon't wanna see your face\n\nYou need to face the facts\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\n\n\nAnother year passed\n\nAnother Friday night\n\nYou showed up at the disco\n\nWhen we caught eyes\n\nThe room started to spin\n\nOoh, and my heart nearly busted\n\n\n\nI should've known better\n\nBut the liquor got me thinking I missed ya\n\nShould've taken ten steps back\n\nBut I wanted to kiss ya\n\nAnd every time you flash those eyes\n\nYou make me reminisce, yeah\n\nYou're looking fine but I'd be lying\n\nIf I said I want you back\n\n\n\nI sleep better than every\n\nNight you were lying next to me\n\nDon't wanna see your face\n\nYou need to face the facts\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\n\n\nThe bigger the lies the harder they fall\n\nThe hotter the fire the faster the love is gonna burn up\n\nThe hotter the fire the smoke and the mirrors\n\nIt's clear I'm better off without ya\n\n\n\nI sleep better than every\n\nNight you were lying next to me\n\nDon't wanna see your face\n\nYou need to face the facts\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\nHeartbeats were made of honesty\n\nAnd all this time\n\nWas it just you and me\n\nIt's sad to say, I'm glad you left\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\nI don't want you back\n\nOh, I don't want you back"
