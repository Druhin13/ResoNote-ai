  "lyrics": "The way his lips parted to sound my name \nFelt like song and dance\r\nHe was a musical without the accolades\r\nI hung on every note\r\nWe performed together nightly\r\nStarting with interludes on my jawline\n\nHe left pitches in the pit of my throat\n\nNever did he choke on the words \"I love you\"\n\nHe said it through his fingertips on my piano keys of a back \n\nHe had a stroke not out of tune \n\nHe knew the lyrics to the song before they were written\n\nOur set was in production \n\nWe could see our nomination for the \"greatest love story ever performed” \n\nStrum these pains with my fingers\n\nLet it hurt a little \n\nI want to be in sync and sink in all that you are in all that I am\n\nI don't want amnesty\n\nJailbird me\n\nBar me inside your rib cage\n\nSo I can rest and lie where all your secrets and desires do\n\nTo study you\n\nLively... nothing can make you feel more awake and dreaming than when our skin fills one another with each other's essence\n\nWe breathe \n\nYou are a hallucinogen and I have on a gas mask\n\nInhale you until I can taste you like I haven't eaten all day\n\nYou satisfy a physiological need\n\nI thought I was complete \n\nI didn't realize how half I was until I found you\n\nSee you make me write love poems for days\n\nSex poems at night \n\nHate poems in the morning \n\nLaughter in the afternoon\n\nAnd It isn't that we love\n\nIt's how we love\n\nLittle time to the human clock, but we make seconds tick like hours \n\nCondemn me to a lifetime of our musical\n\nSo, we can sing and dance when your lips part and sound my name\n\nI can't remember the rest…"
