  "lyrics": "Did I see you down\r\nin a young girl's town\r\nWith your mother in so much pain?\r\nI was almost there\r\nat the top of the stairs\r\nWith her screamin' in the rain.\n\n\n\nDid she wake you up\n\nto tell you that\n\nIt was only a change of plan?\n\nDream up, dream up,\n\nlet me fill your cup\n\nWith the promise of a man.\n\n\n\nDid I see you walking with the boys\n\nThough it was not hand in hand?\n\nAnd was some black face\n\nin a lonely place\n\nWhen you could understand?\n\n\n\nDid she wake you up\n\nto tell you that\n\nIt was only a change of plan?\n\nDream up, dream up,\n\nlet me fill your cup\n\nWith the promise of a man.\n\n\n\nWill I see you give\n\nmore than I can take?\n\nWill I only harvest some?\n\nAs the days fly past\n\nwill we lose our grasp\n\nOr fuse it in the sun?\n\n\n\nDid she wake you up\n\nto tell you that\n\nIt was only a change of plan?\n\nDream up, dream up,\n\nlet me fill your cup\n\nWith the promise of a man."
