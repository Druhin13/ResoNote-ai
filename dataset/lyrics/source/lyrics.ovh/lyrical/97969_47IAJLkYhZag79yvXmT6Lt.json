  "lyrics": "Let's find out just how far I’ll go\r\nTo look like someone you should know\r\nMaybe I'd sound a little better\r\nIf my features were more sweet\r\nYour mind's already been made up\r\nYou saw my number and my number wasn’t good enough\n\nI'll write a little better\n\nIf I'm willing to compete\n\n\n\nI'll do it if I have to\n\nHoping for an inbetween\n\nNot what I meant when I said that I\n\nI wanted to be seen\n\n\n\nHow am I meant to stay on track\n\nWhen each hand I shake will pull me back\n\nOh I'll work a little harder\n\nBut walk a little less\n\nAnd in the end will I feel proud\n\nThat I grit my teeth, and followed the damn crowd\n\nWill I have grown a little empire\n\nOr made a fucking mess\n\n\n\nI'll do it if I have to\n\nHoping for an inbetween\n\nNot what I meant when I said that I\n\nI wanted to be seen\n\nI'll do it if I have to\n\n(I'll keep it to myself)\n\nHoping for an inbetween\n\n(I must have seen that somewhere)\n\nNot what I meant when I said that I\n\nI wanted to be seen"
