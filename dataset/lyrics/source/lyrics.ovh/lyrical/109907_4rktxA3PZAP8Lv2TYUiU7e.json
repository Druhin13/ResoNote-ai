  "lyrics": "RBE X SOB that's the gang\r\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\r\nNiggas speakin' on the gang? That ain't nothin' new (that ain't nothin' new)\r\nYoung rich nigga, all these bands I be runnin' through (bands I be runnin' through)\r\nLil' baby tell me slide, you know I'm comin' through (know I'm comin' through)\n\nBut if I pull up on a bitch, gang comin' too (gang comin' too)\n\nNiggas sayin' they gon' rob me, guess these niggas crazy (niggas crazy)\n\nI don't really want the bitch if she ain't tryna pay me (if she ain't tryna pay me)\n\nAll these hoes want the cuffs but I'm not savin' (but I'm not savin')\n\nBlow a bag on my bitch 'cause that's lil' baby ('cause that's lil' baby)\n\n\n\nWhen I pull up on lil' baby, she feel good inside (she feel good inside)\n\nSaid she love the way I stack, the way I multiply (way I multiply)\n\nMight just hit a nigga block and bitch just open fire (open fire)\n\nCouldn't pull out, I was strokin', shit was over for me (shit was over for me)\n\nShe put my name on it, so she know it's mine (so she know it's mine)\n\nI got cheated on before that made me cold inside (made me cold inside)\n\nDamn why yo' pocket look so big? Bet you it's a loaf inside (it's a loaf inside)\n\nT.O. when you gon' leave the streets? I just won't decide (I just won't decide)\n\n\n\nAnd I'm stuck up in the field, so I tote a 9\n\nAnd I'm always in the field, I don't go inside\n\nI ain't that bold, to yo' face I never told a lie\n\nAnd she always think she right, I guess she know a lot\n\nIf you can't match more than a zip, then I ain't rollin' wit' you (I ain't rollin' wit' you)\n\nIf you can't tie me in the whip, then I can't go and get you\n\nYou bitch be cheatin' wit' my nigga, you ain't know that did you? (you ain't know that did you)\n\nNigga leave these streets alone, you don't got it in you (you don't got it in you)\n\nYou be scared to pull the trigger, why you tote that pistol?\n\nYou got somethin' you gotta say, then why you hold that in you? (hold that in you)\n\nNigga, speak yo' mind or somethin' (speak yo' mind or somethin')\n\nAlways tellin' me 'bout that bitch like she mine or somethin' (like she mine or somethin')\n\nWhy you cuffin' on that bitch like she fine or somethin'? (fine or somethin')\n\nIf it ain't cream while you hit then you dry fuckin' (dry fuckin')\n\nWhy I work so damn hard? 'Cause my time comin' (my time comin')\n\nIf you ain't doin' shit wit' yo' life, then go find somethin' (then go find somethin')\n\n\n\nWhen I pull up on lil' baby, she feel good inside (she feel good inside)\n\nSaid she love the way I stack, the way I multiply (way I multiply)\n\nMight just hit a nigga block and bitch just open fire (open fire)\n\nCouldn't pull out, I was strokin', shit was over for me (shit was over for me)\n\nShe put my name on it, so she know it's mine (so she know it's mine)\n\nI got cheated on before that made me cold inside (made me cold inside)\n\nDamn why yo' pocket look so big? Bet you it's a loaf inside (it's a loaf inside)\n\nT.O. when you gon' leave the streets? I just won't decide (I just won't decide)"
