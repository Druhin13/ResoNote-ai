  "lyrics": "The feeling when your head gets\r\nYou'll know it when your head gets surreal\r\nSo feel it in the best way\r\nAnd call it when the moment's revealed\r\nAnd then you'll let your chest breathe\r\nAnd your head stream\n\nAnd make headway for your daydreams\n\nAnd there's thinking\n\nYou try to excavate the feelings but they'd stay in\n\nIt's like the rhythm of the beat is just a feeling\n\nBut there's no need to feel the way that it does\n\nWhen you're running and you feel so above it\n\nAnd there's reason why we are redone\n\nSo pull yourself into the wind and say\n\n\n\nI will be waiting for you, I\n\nI will be waiting for you, I\n\nIt's lame, but I will keep waiting for you\n\nIt's lame, but I will be waiting\n\n\n\nSo pull yourself together now\n\nPull it all together now\n\nOpen up your head until your tears are streaming out\n\nThen there'll be people in the line\n\nNow spinning safely by my side\n\n'Cause then our hands are at the corner of your desk until the ink runs out\n\nAnd then you'll see yourself in the mirror of the piles of people singing out that that's the way, 'cause that's the way now\n\nAll your leaves will change with season, count to eight to hear the gleaming\n\nBut be prepared 'cause when you see it, everything will start competing\n\n\n\nAnd I will be waiting for you, I\n\nI will be waiting for you, I\n\nIt's late, but I will keep waiting for you\n\nIt's late, but I will be waiting\n\n\n\nI will be waiting for you\n\nAnd for the first time, it's just the first time\n\nI will be waiting for you\n\nAnd for the first time, it's just the first time I figured out\n\nI will be waiting for you\n\nAnd for the first time, it's just the first time\n\nI will be waiting for you\n\nAnd for the first time, it's just the first time I figured out\n\nAnd for the first time, it's just the first time\n\nAnd for the first time, it's just the first time I figured out"
