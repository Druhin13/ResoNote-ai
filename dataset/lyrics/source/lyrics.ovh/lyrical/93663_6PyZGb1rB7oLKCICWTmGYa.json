  "lyrics": "Standing in the open light\r\nWithin the swelter of the night\r\nI found myself staring at you\r\nAnd every time our fingers touched\r\nI felt like it would be too much\r\nAnd too little to hang onto\n\n\n\nI cannot fall in love with you\n\nI cannot feel this way so soon\n\nI cannot be this way with you\n\nI cannot fall in love with you\n\n\n\nI knew it when you walked my way\n\nThat I'd be begging you to stay\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI felt it burning in a way\n\nI held on when you pulled away\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it\n\nI couldn't just say it\n\n\n\nEvery evening, every time\n\nI keep replaying in my mind\n\nAnd wondering if you do the same\n\nAnd if it makes you lose your grip\n\nAnd if it makes you just forget\n\nThat all of it's a bit insane\n\n\n\nI cannot fall in love with you\n\nI cannot feel this way so soon, so soon\n\nI cannot be this way with you\n\nI cannot fall in love with you\n\n\n\nI knew it when you walked my way\n\nThat I'd be begging you to stay\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI felt it burning in a way\n\nI held on when you pulled away\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI knew it when you walked my way\n\nThat I'd be begging you to stay\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI felt it burning in a way\n\nI held on when you pulled away\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it to myself\n\nI couldn't say it\n\nI couldn't just say it\n\n\n\nI cannot fall in love with you\n\nI cannot feel this way so soon\n\nI cannot be this way with you\n\nI cannot fall in love with you"
