  "lyrics": "She does her best\r\nThinking in the morning\r\nShe barely sleeps\r\nBut that don't bother her\r\nPenelope\n\nThe whole world drives you crazy\n\nBut not half as crazy as you drive the world\n\n\n\nShe reads her books\n\nAnd goes out every evening\n\nShe ran away\n\nWhen she was just a girl\n\n\n\nPenelope\n\nThe whole world drives you crazy\n\nBut not half as crazy as you drive the world\n\n\n\nAnd she loves riding on her bicycle\n\nThrough the middle of town when the whole town's asleep\n\nAnd she's not wearing anything\n\nBut a tattoo of a wedding ring\n\nFrom another life but that life was a blur\n\n\n\nPenelope\n\nThe whole world drives you crazy\n\nBut not half as crazy as you drive the world\n\n\n\nPenelope\n\nThe whole world drives you crazy\n\nBut not half as crazy as you drive the world"
