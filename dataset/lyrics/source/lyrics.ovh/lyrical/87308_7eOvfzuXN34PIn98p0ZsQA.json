  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Houdini Punches par Son Volt\r\n\nWind there blows the dust off of holy ground\nNo exit for hope, gone from bad to worse\nMocking an assault of society's dream\nComprehension and pain to pick up off the floor\n\n\nHeart attack through him, within condition\nFlies are buzzing around with an eye to scorekeeper\nReality falls when the new thrill burns down\n\n\nFeelings resonate, parallel lives get drawn out\nToo many Houdini punches may fall\nStranded by reasons for staying, imploring\n\nReason is a telescope when you're on your own\n\n\nHeart attack through him, within condition\nFlies are buzzing around with an eye to scorekeeper\nReality falls when the new thrill burns down\nFlies are buzzing around with an eye to scorekeeper\nReality falls when the new thrill burns down"
