  "lyrics": "Such precious cargo you took for granted\r\nLet my heart follow you, now it's stranded, still\r\nIf hearts fell from the sky you still wouldn't find\r\nAnother like mine\r\nYou had your chance\n\nAt something beautiful\n\nBut love like mine\n\nIs so unusual\n\n\n\nYeah, today's your birthday\n\nAnd I used to make a thing about it\n\nI'd even spin you 'round the parking lot and sing about it\n\nYou'd get embarrassed and I'd tell you\n\nShit, I would go to hell with you and back\n\nSo what's the parking lot for now\n\nLet 'em look at what we have\n\nI guess I said too much, I shouldn't have opened up\n\nShit, who am I playing? I'm a lover, I was born to love\n\nI even got my heart tatted on my sleeve\n\nYou can search the whole world but I promise\n\nYou won't ever find another me\n\n\n\nSuch precious cargo you took for granted\n\nLet my heart follow you, now it's stranded, still\n\nIf hearts fell from the sky you'd never find\n\nAnother like mine\n\n\n\nYou had your chance\n\nAt something beautiful\n\nBut love like mine\n\nIs so unusual\n\n\n\nYou'll never ever find something so real (you had your chance)\n\nSomething so real, won't ever get me back (at something beautiful)\n\nNever ever find something so real (but love like mine)\n\nNo matter how long you look (it's so unusual)\n\nYou'll never ever find something so real\n\nSomething so real, something so real\n\nYou'll never ever find something so real\n\nSomething so real, something so real\n\nYou'll never ever find something so real\n\nSomething so real, something so real\n\nYou'll never ever find something so real\n\nNo matter how long you look"
