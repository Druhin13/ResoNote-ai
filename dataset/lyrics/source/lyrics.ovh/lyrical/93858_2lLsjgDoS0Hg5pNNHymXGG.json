  "lyrics": "I see you, you on the edge of your seat\r\nAin't you got some place to be?\r\nWas hoping the suspense would kill you\r\nTell me, how would you begin?\r\nWatching and waiting to sink your teeth in\r\nCome on and give me your expert opinion, ah, fuck it\n\nI settle down in a dump\n\nHeard a crowd screaming \"Jump\"\n\nSo I came to the window\n\n(They always wanna kick you when you're down)\n\nI said, \"What the fuck have I done?\"\n\nThey said, \"We just want your blood\n\nYou know we like you better in limbo\"\n\n(They always wanna kick you when you're down)\n\n\n\nSo come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough\n\nDon't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now\n\n'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue\n\n\n\nBut tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?\n\nYou better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)\n\nAnd why you tryna put me in the ground?\n\nDon't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof\n\nGo ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)\n\nSo why you gotta kick me when I'm down? (Down)\n\n(Why you gotta kick me when I'm down? Ooh)\n\n\n\nYeah, I know it's all in good fun, but\n\nDon't say it's coming from love now\n\nI see those arms in akimbo\n\n(They always wanna kick you when you're down)\n\nAnd don't set that phaser to stun 'cause\n\nWhat doesn't kill me, well, it better run like hell\n\nYeah, you better run like hell\n\n\n\nSo come on and take a shot, you just can't get enough\n\nDon't let the fact that you know nothing stop you talking now\n\n'Cause when all is said and done, my name's still on your tongue\n\n\n\nSo tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?\n\nYou better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)\n\nAnd why you tryna put me in the ground?\n\nDon't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof\n\nGo ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)\n\n\n\nRemember this line that you crossed\n\nLook back and stare at the dot\n\nKnow there's no turning back now\n\nNow, that you've opened the gates\n\nCorrupted the memory, error, failsafe\n\n(Commence the countdown)\n\n(They always wanna kick you when you're down)\n\nRemember this line that you crossed\n\nLook back and stare at the dot\n\nKnow there's no way to fix us (No)\n\nOh, God, what the fuck have you done?\n\nI loved you like daughters, I loved you like sons\n\n\n\nSo tell me, yeah tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?\n\nYou better pray I don't get up this time around (Ooh)\n\nAnd why you tryna put me in the ground?\n\nDon't you know I'm a seed? (I'm a seed) I won't stop at the roof\n\nGo ahead, bury me; this is how I grow, it's how I thrive (Ooh)\n\nWhy you gotta kick me when I'm down?\n\n\n\nBut tell me, why you gotta kick me when I'm down?\n\n(This is how I grow, this is how I thrive)"
