  "lyrics": "Give me two strong arms\r\nTo protect myself\r\nGive me so much love \nThat I forget myself\r\nI need to swing from limb to limb\r\nTo relieve this mess I'm in\n\n'Cause when depression starts to win\n\nI need to be right by your side\n\n\n\nNo one seems to touch me\n\nIn the way you do\n\nNothing seems to hurt me\n\nWhen I'm close to you\n\nI'm so full of desire\n\nWhen you set my head on fire\n\nI need to be right by your side\n\n\n\nEvery single one of us needs \n\nLove, love, love\n\nEverybody needs to give and receive love\n\nEvery single day can drag us \n\nDown, down, down\n\nBut there's nothing left to fear\n\nWhen love gets into town\n\n\n\nI'm so full of desire\n\nWhen you set my head on fire\n\nI need to be right by your side"
