  "lyrics": "I opened the door and I found I was looking at danger;\nIt's been too many years but we're hiding our faces like strangers;\nShe says that she's got to gobut there ain't no way;\nI'm letting her walk while there's something to say;\nIt's been too many years,\nTo watch our hearts die in this way.\n\nShe's feeling a time for a seasonal change and she's yearning;\n\nTo shake the trees of our love in the streets where the leaves are for burning;\n\nAll things on this earth were made for the dying;\n\nOne look in my soul says there just ain't no use trying;\n\nIt's been too many years,\n\nTo watch our hearts die in this way.\n\nIn an unwritten time I thought that life was for sharing;\n\nAnd living together was simply a matter of caring;\n\nBut things did not work out like I planned;\n\nAnd alienation has left me here damned;\n\nIt's been too many years,\n\nTo watch our hearts die in this way"
