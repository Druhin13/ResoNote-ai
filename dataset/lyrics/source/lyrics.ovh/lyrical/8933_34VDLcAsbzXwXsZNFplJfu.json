  "lyrics": "I ain't perfect\r\nNo I never claimed to be\r\nAnd I'm still workin' on a better side of me\r\nSometimes I drink too much\r\nSometimes I smoke and cuss\r\nI work hard to play hard hell like everybody does\n\n\n\nBut I took the long way every lesson I learned\n\nI gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned\n\nBut looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned\n\nNo worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned\n\n\n\nYeah I've been real close I've even said those three words\n\nAnd everybody knows when you take it back it hurts\n\nEvery little white lie and every bullshit fire\n\nIt started the fire when the flames got higher\n\nJust stew up two and smoke the tires\n\n\n\nBut I took the long way every lesson I learned\n\nI gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned\n\nBut looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned\n\nNo worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned\n\n\n\nBut I took the long way every lesson I learned\n\nI gotta scar to show for every stripe that I've earned\n\nBut looking back can't help but laugh at all the pages I've turned\n\nNo worries it's just water under the bridges I've burned\n\nIt's just water under the bridges I've burned"
