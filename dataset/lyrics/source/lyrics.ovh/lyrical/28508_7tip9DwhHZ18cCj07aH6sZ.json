  "lyrics": "The air is thick\r\nthe air is wasted\r\nthe lamb lies down for our entertainment\r\nsome mother's son\r\ncrashed at the pavement\r\nhis little eyes gone\n\nwe're one in the same man\n\nnow you know you never waste it\n\nnow you know you're wasted\n\n\n\nI hear your voice, there's no emotion\n\ndid something die\n\nyou're not even responsive\n\nwhen we were young we'd bottle water\n\ncollect reptile bones, commence the slaughter\n\nnow you know you never waste it\n\nnow you know you're wasted\n\n\n\nall your dreams thrown in the trash\n\nyou were born into war\n\nyou were taught not to ask\n\nfor every single possibility\n\nmoving shadows in the dark\n\ndeciding fates over cocktail lunch\n\nevery single possibility\n\n\n\nwe better bust them out\n\nyou better bust them out\n\nheart attacks won't get us down\n\nour rifle butts pressed in the ground\n\nour brains are lost, our skulls are found\n\nwe're kicking up the dust above them"
