  "lyrics": "The grieving widow's pose, she stands with head held high\r\nNever to re-marry, never gonna' try\r\n'Cause that would end the symphony of sadness that we play\r\nAnd the songs of wanderlust that she commiserates\r\nSo she takes another shot of crown, in hopes to ease the pain\r\nIn hopes to ease the void inside, yet somehow it's in vain\n\n'Cause vanity has come along and filled her perfume vial \n\nAnd every day she dabs a little on her neck and smiles\n\n\n\nBehind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)\n\nBehind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)\n\nOpen your eyes, let us see the void inside\n\nOpen your eyes, let us see\n\n\n\nThe old man sits alone staring at the screen\n\nAnd contemplates the failures, done to his family\n\n'Cause depression's bottle's come along and filled his whiskey glass \n\nWith every sip put to his lips, erases all the past\n\nSo he tells another little lie and tells another tale\n\nIn hopes to spare the family and hide his private hell\n\nBut the more the words come out of him, like little cuts and scabs\n\nTearing at the tender hearts who gaze upon a mask\n\n\n\nBehind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)\n\nBehind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)\n\nOpen your eyes, let us see the void inside\n\n\n\nShe puts her feet in well-worn shoes\n\nWalks toward the past\n\nOf the character\n\nBehind the mask\n\n\n\n\n\nSlowly climb out of your shell\n\nStart to believe\n\nEvery now and then those demons\n\nWill come to feast\n\nOn your flesh and bones\n\n\n\nBehind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)\n\nBehind a mask (so we hide, so we hide)\n\nOpen your eyes, let us see the void inside\n\nOpen your eyes, let us see"
