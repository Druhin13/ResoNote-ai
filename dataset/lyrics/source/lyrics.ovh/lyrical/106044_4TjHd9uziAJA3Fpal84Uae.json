(the perfect one)\n\nCan you switch it up for me and become the perfect bitch? (perfect one)\n\n\n\nSee one of my bitches is nice, the other one aggressive (ratchets)\n\nThe new one know her place but the old one get so possessive\n\nI hate when they both don't play their part, ooh that's messy\n\nI deal with so much shit in the streets, ooh don't stress me\n\nI can't choose, both of y'all bad, I can't lose\n\nYou call me bae, she call me zaddy\n\nYou tell me no, she automatic\n\nAnd I love y'all both the same, and I know that's crazy\n\nWhoever leave me first, the other one she gon' be my lady (yeah yeah)\n\nIf I took her attitude and your sex drive (what'd happen?)\n\nAnd put it one bitch it would be so live (litty)\n\nMaybe even perfect\n\nIf your spot was on the line, would you show me you deserve it?\n\nShow me she ain't worth it? (answer that)\n\n\n\nBoth of them together make the perfect bitch (both of them)\n\nWish I could have them both because I hate to pick (I hate this shit)\n\nComplicated, situation delicate (so delicate)\n\nCan you stop the allegations and the petty shit?\n\nCan you change it up for me and make the perfect bitch?\n\nIs you gon' hold a nigga down through the worst of it?\n\nCan you fix your attitude and make the perfect bitch? (the perfect one)\n\nCan you switch it up for me and become the perfect bitch? (perfect one)\n\n\n\nWould you hold me down like gravity if I got jammed?\n\nIf I gave it all up today would I still be your man? (answer that)\n\nWhen we got together other bitches wasn't in the plan\n\nNow it's like you my right but she my left hand (true story)\n\nI need a machine I can tell what I need, and it create a bitch\n\nBad and bougie, not a basic bitch\n\nMy money good, I'ma pay for it (pay for it)\n\nI know nobody is perfect, I'm just sayin' what if (what?)\n\nI could have who I want with, welcome to my fantasy\n\nDon't judge me (nah)\n\n\n\nBoth of them together make the perfect bitch (both of them)\n\nWish I could have them both because I hate to pick (I hate this shit)\n\nComplicated, situation delicate (so delicate)\n\nCan you stop the allegations and the petty shit?\n\nCan you change it up for me and make the perfect bitch?\n\nIs you gon' hold a nigga down through the worst of it?\n\nCan you fix your attitude and make the perfect bitch? (the perfect one)\n\nCan you switch it up for me and become the perfect bitch? (the perfect one)"
