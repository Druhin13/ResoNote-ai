  "lyrics": "As I walk through the shallows of my distant mind\r\nI see the forms of faces I had long forgot\r\nThey search and reach, though their secrets I will keep\r\nDespair, oh my child\r\nEverything that we've worked for is gone\n\nAnd I'll keep running away, pulling away\n\nFacing the days that don't seem to end\n\nHow can I make amends?\n\nBreak yourself, do it again, then you begin\n\n\n\nIt doesn't seem to end, a hollow sense of self takes its root within\n\n\n\nCrush the stone in your hand until it bleeds\n\nAll of the pain that you've felt now isn't real, it never was\n\nOnly age and disillusion remain\n\nI face it all the same\n\n\n\nI'll face the endless days\n\nCollect my weary bones\n\nAnd touch my fragile skin\n\nMaking it new again\n\n\n\nIn this world, as disillusion incarnate\n\nAs this place, grows smaller every day\n\nIn this world, I feel no presence with me\n\nTo escape, I'd give it all away\n\n\n\nCrush the stone in your hand until it bleeds\n\nAll of the pain that you've felt now isn't real, it never was\n\nOnly age and disillusion remain\n\nThe hollow thoughts prevail\n\n\n\nIf there's only one thing I promise\n\nIt's that you'll turn back\n\nAnd leave this place like a ghost\n\nForever turned away\n\nI'll face the endless days"
