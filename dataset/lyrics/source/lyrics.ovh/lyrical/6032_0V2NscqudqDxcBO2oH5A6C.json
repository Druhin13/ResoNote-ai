  "lyrics": "It’s not the way that you walk that gets me off\r\nIt's the way that you think\r\nIt's the way that you talk\r\nAnd when I see something I like you know that I gotta pounce\r\nAll the things that you say, say, say\r\nI can trust every ounce\n\n\n\nBut I can't tell this girl what's on my mind\n\nAnd it seems it's getting closer all the time\n\nOoh, girl\n\nI can't tell this girl what's on my mind\n\nAnd it seems it's getting closer all the time\n\n\n\nCause I went to a party and I left my pretty baby with Ralphie\n\nBaby and now I’m alone\n\nWas feeling much better when you weren’t here\n\nAnd now I’m feeling something and I know she’s doing better without me, baby\n\nGuess I’ll go home whether that’s with or without you\n\n\n\nAnd I know that it's too hard\n\nFor you to play it back from the start\n\nAnd no, I don't know your name\n\nOr the frame of your mind\n\n\n\nBut I can't tell this girl what's on my mind\n\nAnd it seems it's getting closer all the time\n\nOoh, girl\n\nI can't tell this girl what's on my mind\n\nAnd it seems it's getting closer all the time\n\n\n\nCause I went to a party and I left my pretty baby with Ralphie\n\nBaby and now I’m alone\n\nWas feeling much better when you weren’t here\n\nAnd now I’m feeling something and I know she’s doing better without me, baby\n\nGuess I’ll go home whether that’s with or without you"
