  "lyrics": "Let me run with you tonight\r\nI'll take you on a moonlight ride\r\nThere's someone I used to see\r\nBut she don't give a damn for me\r\nBut let me get to the point, let's roll another joint\n\nAnd turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud\n\nYou don't know how it feels\n\nYou don't know how it feels to be me\n\n\n\nPeople come, people go\n\nSome grow young, some grow cold\n\nI woke up in between\n\nA memory and a dream\n\n\n\nSo let's get to the point, let's roll another joint\n\nLet's head on down the road\n\nThere's somewhere I gotta go\n\nAnd you don't know how it feels\n\nYou don't know how it feels to be me\n\n\n\nMy old man was born to rock\n\nHe's still tryin' to beat the clock\n\nThink of me what you will\n\nI've got a little space to fill\n\n\n\nSo let's get to the point, let's roll another joint\n\nAnd let's head on down the road\n\nThere's somewhere I got to go\n\nAnd you don't know how it feels\n\nNo, you don't know how it feels to be me"
