  "lyrics": "And it cuts (cuts)\r\nDeeper than the roots of the trees that we planted in the graveyard (graveyard)\r\nI don't think these scars will ever fade off (fade off)\r\nGood thing nothing seems to phase us\r\nSo numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nHow'd we get so numb? (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb)\n\nSo numb\n\n\n\nOooh, I've been stuck in a spell\n\nBreathing in the poison like I'm in love with the smell\n\nAhhh, don't have no choice\n\nScreaming at the static now, I don't have no voice\n\nWeee, can't tell the real from the fake\n\nIf we get stressed out, pop the seal and escape\n\nAhhh, feel good right now\n\nI got a lot of shit to do, but I'ma just lie down\n\nDon't wake me up, I'm having good dreams\n\nI can't feel nothing, and that's a good thing\n\nI feel useful when I get used\n\nSo numb, I don't wanna hear the truth\n\n\n\nSo numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nHow'd we get so numb? (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb)\n\nSo numb\n\nSo numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nHow'd we get so numb? (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb)\n\nSo numb\n\n\n\nOooh, I've been stuck in a fog\n\nIt's killing me, but I don't feel nothing at all\n\nAhhh, just a notch on the belt\n\nI'm in a photo on the front page calling for help\n\nWeee, are just playing around\n\nI got a bulletproof casket, plated and gold\n\nDoon't, I make death look good\n\nEveryone's staring at me just like they should\n\nThere's no pilot in the cockpit\n\nBut I can still talk while staying on topic\n\nI been sleepwalking around for days\n\nAnd no one's noticed that I'm not awake\n\n\n\nAnd it cuts (cuts)\n\nDeeper than the roots of the trees that we planted in the graveyard (graveyard)\n\nI don't think these scars will ever fade off (fade off)\n\nGood thing nothing seems to faze us\n\n\n\nSo numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nHow'd we get so numb? (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb)\n\nSo numb\n\nSo numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb, so numb)\n\nHow'd we get so numb? (so numb, so numb)\n\nWe've become so numb (so numb)\n\nSo numb\n\n\n\nAnd it cuts... (oww)\n\nOww\n\nOww\n\nOww\n\nOww\n\nOww\n\nOww\n\nOww"
