  "lyrics": "Promises promises year after year on my knees\r\nParadise knocks for my future just have to believe\r\nFlood flood, flood in the streets so they said\r\nBlood blood, blood in the streets of my head\r\nDo you believe in me?\n\nDo you believe in me?\n\nWe believed in you\n\nWe believed in you\n\n\n\nJust listen to father and he'll set you up\n\nTo succeeds in the soil to dry to produce\n\nWhat we need for our family\n\nTrees cutting down to our knees\n\nWe look up to the sky to retell the old\n\nStory's of glorious battles victorious\n\nBrothers notorious\n\nEmpire turned to dust\n\nMen turned delirious, reasons mysterious\n\nDestruction comes near to us\n\nMothers shed tears for us!\n\n\n\nDo you believe in me?\n\nDo you believe in me?\n\nWe believed in you\n\nWe believed in you\n\n\n\nLift on my knees\n\nThey told me, that you'd set me free\n\nWe lost our ears\n\nTogether because of the fear\n\nNo, I'm never gonna make it there\n\nI just wanna ?? be it sunny days\n\nLet it only be cracks and tears\n\nLooking at the sky through thick and rainy days\n\n\n\nDo you believe in me?\n\nDo you believe in me?\n\nWe believed in you\n\nWe believed in you"
