  "lyrics": "And I'm not running\r\nEyes fall to my side\r\nI'm gonna get to know it\r\nKeep it round my side\r\nI was waiting out the water\n\nWon't let the waves take me back\n\nI was waiting out the water\n\nWon't let the waves take me under\n\n\n\nTo the edge of reflection\n\nI'm rising up\n\nThe truth is gonna find us\n\nI'm rising up\n\nThe answer's in reflection\n\nI'm rising up\n\nKnow the truth is right behind me\n\nI'm rising up\n\n\n\nHands in the air, I'm jumping in\n\nJumping into the deep end\n\nIt's a brave ride\n\nGot to sink into the feeling\n\nBefore you can fly\n\n\n\nI was waiting out the water\n\nWon't let the waves take me back\n\nI was waiting out the water\n\nWon't let the waves take me back\n\n\n\nTo the edge of reflection\n\nI'm rising up\n\nThe truth is gonna find us\n\nI'm rising up\n\nThe answer's in reflection\n\nI'm rising up\n\nKnow the truth is right behind me\n\nI'm rising up"
