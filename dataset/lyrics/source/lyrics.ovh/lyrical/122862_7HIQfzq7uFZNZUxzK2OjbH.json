  "lyrics": "Been thinking about the old me\r\nCause I've been feeling empty\r\nI never used to be so dead inside\r\nI think I lost my memory\r\nI can't remember care-free\r\nAnd all my days turn into fight or flight\n\n\n\nI wanna get back, tell me how to get back\n\nI wanna get back, tell me how to get back\n\n\n\nSay it again, say it again! Tell me what I wanna hear\n\nTell me that I'm gonna be fine and there's nothing left to fear\n\nCause I've been losing sleep\n\nTrying to get back to who I used to be\n\nWhere is the old me?\n\n(What happened to the old me?)\n\n\n\nI don't like who I've become\n\nA hollow shell of someone\n\nAnd I feel like a stranger to myself\n\nI don't need to start over\n\nI just need to get back to when\n\nI didn't wake up to this hell I'm in\n\n\n\nSay it again, say it again! Tell me what I wanna hear\n\nTell me that I'm gonna be fine and there's nothing left to fear\n\nCause I've been losing sleep\n\nTrying to get back to who I used to be\n\nWhere is the old me?\n\n(What happened to the old me?)\n\n\n\nI wanna get back, tell me how to get back\n\nI wanna get back, tell me how to get back!\n\nGet back!\n\n\n\nI wanna get back to when I didn't think about\n\nThe death of everything I never thought I'd live without\n\nBut when I look around the only thing I see\n\nIs the broken pieces of the person who I used to be\n\n\n\nSay it again, say it again! Tell me what I wanna hear\n\nTell me that I'm gonna be fine and there's nothing left to fear\n\nCause I've been losing sleep\n\nTrying to get back to who I used to be\n\nWhere is the old me?\n\n(What happened to the old me?)\n\n\n\nI wanna get back, tell me how to get back!"
