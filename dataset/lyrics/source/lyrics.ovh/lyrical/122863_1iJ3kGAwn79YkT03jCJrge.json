  "lyrics": "Happiness is automatic\r\nThere's music in the air\r\nGrab the boxes from the attic\r\nAnd haul 'em down the stairs\r\nFreezing weather's 'round the corner\r\nAnd everybody knows\n\nSoon the tree will be all lit up\n\nSparkling as it glows\n\n\n\nToday's anything but the same-old-thing\n\nI can almost hear those sleigh bells ring\n\nSingin' all those happy songs\n\nWhile the little ones all dance along\n\nTake a real quick look around and suddenly I see\n\nIt's not even Christmas yet, I got all the gifts I need\n\n\n\nRunnin' 'round in plaid pajamas and slippers on our feet\n\nMama takes that photograph while we all talk through our teeth\n\nSugar cookies in the oven\n\nShaped like tiny trees\n\nStealing goodies by the dozen\n\nAnd makin' memories\n\n\n\nToday's anything but the same-old-thing\n\nI can almost hear those sleigh bells ring\n\nSingin' all those happy songs\n\nWhile the little ones all dance along\n\nTake a real quick look around and suddenly I see\n\nIt's not even Christmas yet, I got all the gifts I need\n\n\n\nGot caught hangin' the mistletoe\n\nSomebody stole a little kiss\n\nI ain't tied a single bow\n\nBut I can already cross love off my list\n\nTake a real quick look around and suddenly I see\n\nIt's not even Christmas yet, I got all the gifts I need\n\nI take a real quick look around and suddenly I see\n\nIt's not even Christmas yet, I got all the gifts I need"
