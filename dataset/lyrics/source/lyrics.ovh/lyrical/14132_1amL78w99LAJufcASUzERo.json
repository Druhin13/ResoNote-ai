  "lyrics": "When fatal thoughts in winding sense\r\nStrive to go past the terminal line\r\nIs it cruel to ease the pain\r\nOf those who face redemption?\r\nDare I take a leap of faith\n\nKnowing my fears will materialize\n\nI lay myself down at your grace\n\nIn stilness I surrender\n\n\n\nUnderneath this kevlar skin\n\nI am waiting for you to uncover me\n\nAnd in this armoured prison cell\n\nI'm hiding my scars\n\nCome discover me\n\n\n\nTell me what is pain if not just fear\n\nSaying goodbye to a poisonous mind\n\nI let it hurt and hope that you\n\nWill be my soul's salvation\n\n\n\nUnderneath this kevlar skin\n\nI am waiting for you to uncover me\n\nAnd in this armoured prison cell\n\nI'm hiding my scars\n\nCome discover me\n\n\n\nMy solitude\n\nA loyal friend\n\nYou kept my darkest secret\n\nAnd guarded my \n\nMonotonous immortality\n\nKeeping the fire away"
