  "lyrics": "(Robert Lamm)\r\nDriving down the concrete beams\r\nLooking around and it now seems\r\nMama Earth is nowhere\r\nGone from your eyes\n\nHidden in the crust\n\nOf man's scientific dreams\n\nShe is gone\n\nNatural man took her natural face\n\nMade it a strange and alien place\n\nYou can't bear to look\n\n'Cause she ain't there\n\nOur Mother has been raped\n\nAnd left to die in disgrace\n\nShe is gone"
