  "lyrics": "Hangin' around, hittin' the ground, dead in the water\r\nSuckin' it up, fuckin' it up, the favorite daughter\r\nTakin' a swing, everything goin' 'round in circles\r\nTakin' a hit, this is it, I'm over it\r\nI can't quit\n\nI'm over it\n\n\n\nShutting it up, cutting me up with broken glasses\n\nHavin' a bourb, been learning love in evening classes\n\nGettin' your man and go to work out with your sister\n\nTalkin' a bit, but this it, I'm over it\n\n\n\nI can't quit\n\nI'm over it\n\nI can't quit\n\nI'm over it\n\n\n\nYou can't change me, can you?\n\nYou can't offer that much to me\n\nOh you can't offer change, can you?\n\nAnd I can't offer that much to you\n\n\n\nHavin' it out, livin' in doubt with no defenses\n\nTighten the rope, and talkin' to hope in different tenses\n\nCallin' my friends and tellin' the only one that answers\n\nIt's hard to admit, but this it, I'm over it\n\n\n\nI can't quit\n\nI'm over it\n\n(I'm so dramatic)\n\nI can't quit\n\n(I'm so dramatic)\n\n\n\nYou can't change me, can you?\n\nYou can't offer that much to me\n\nOh you can't offer change, can you?\n\nAnd I can't offer that much to you\n\n\n\nI can't quit\n\n(I'm so dramatic)\n\nI'm over it\n\n(Hangin' around, go underground down in my basement)\n\nI can't quit\n\n(Suckin' it up, fuckin' it up with your replacement)\n\nI'm over it\n\n(Takin' a swing, everything goin' round in circles)\n\nI can't quit\n\n(Takin' a hit, this it)\n\nI'm over it"
