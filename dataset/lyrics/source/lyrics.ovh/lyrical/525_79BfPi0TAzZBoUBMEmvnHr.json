  "lyrics": "Early morning day is dawning\rCooling towers and factory gates\rDirty streets and laughing people\rSkinny dogs and beer crates\rHello my old friend\rHello my old friend\rSad canals green black water\rSomewhere bicycles and beds\rWet and windy afternoons\rAnd pigeons coo in garden sheds\rHello my old friend\rHello my old friend\rHigh-rise tower blocks with panoramic\rViews of trains and coal\rTiehead railway tracks tread faithfully\rThe gas works to behold\rHello my old friend\rHello my old friend\rJust to see the sunset\rPretty rainbows over your majestic towers\rTo feel your earth beneath my feet\rHere I could stand for hours and hours\rBig machines that once were champions\rTurn to dust under the sky\rBroken windows choking chimneys\rFactory walls for miles and miles\rBy bye my old friend\rBy bye my old friend\rJust to see the sunset\rPretty rainbows over your majestic towers\rTo feel your earth beneath my feet\rHere I could stand for hours and hours"
