  "lyrics": "The rights and freedoms that we have today were won by your mothers, your fathers, your grandmothers, your grandfathers, your ancestors before them\r\nWe stand on the shoulders of giants and we owe it to our ancestors. Not just to defend the rights and freedoms that they fought for at such cost and at such sacrifice, that continue their struggle that a different sort of society, not a society run in the interests of a tiny elite, but a society run in the interests of the majority"
