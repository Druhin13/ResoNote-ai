  "lyrics": "Woah...oh...ooh\r\nWe didn’t sing Kumbaya, we sang with straight pipes off a 305\r\nWe never cussed around our momma's but we raised hell\r\nUntil the day of the church bells\n\nNanny made apple pie in the kitchen\n\nPaw Paw cut the combs off chickens\n\nAnd daddy burned up this old town\n\nIn a ragged GT with three different wheels\n\nMomma read tarot cards under that moon\n\nSpoke to God with some candles in the bathroom\n\nMy brothers and me was some rednecks comin' up on a one lane\n\n\n\nWe didn’t sing Kumbaya, we sang with straight pipes off a 305\n\nWe never cussed around our momma's but we raised hell\n\nUntil the day of the church bells\n\n\n\nWe didn't play with Tonka toys\n\nWe shot bb guns at the neighbor next door\n\nAny kid who moved in new\n\nGot a taste of that old swampy green juice\n\nWalked bare feet 'til our feet turned\n\nBlack as the slate on a swimmin' hole floor\n\nAnd any car that drove by the midnight street\n\nNever seen my six inch blade\n\n\n\nWe didn’t sing Kumbaya, we sang with straight pipes off a 305\n\nWe never cussed around our momma's but we raised hell\n\nUntil the day of the church bells\n\n\n\nSo dear momma, daddy, nanny, and Chicken Willie above\n\nI hope you're happy of the thick skinned man that I've become\n\nThat I've become (That I've become)\n\nThat I've become (That I've become)\n\nThat I've become\n\n\n\nWe didn’t sing Kumbaya, we sang with straight pipes off a 305\n\nWe never cussed around our momma's but we raised hell\n\nUntil the day of the church bells"
