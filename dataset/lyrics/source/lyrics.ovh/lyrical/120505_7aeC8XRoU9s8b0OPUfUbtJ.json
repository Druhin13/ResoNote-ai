(Hey)\n\n\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me?\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me\n\n\n\nIt's a whole lot of, \"Tell me what you done for me lately, only call me when you want a favor\"\n\nTurning on you like it's 180, she told me \"Don't be a stranger\"\n\nBut that's not what friends do, girl, I know what that means\n\nIf you thinkin' what I think you're thinkin', man, girl I'm onto your schemes\n\nGot a lot of \"friends\" in air quotes\n\nDope moments, we share those\n\nIt's weird, yo, people that I don't know actin' like we are close\n\nAnd lately, all my new friends just my co-workers\n\nSo where I go when my soul hurtin'?\n\n\n\nIf you knew I was buggin' and you stayed quiet\n\nYou said I was right when I ain't right\n\nWell that's not what friends do\n\nThat's not what friends do\n\nAlright, who are you, huh? (Hey)\n\n\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me?\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey (so when did you get like this?)\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey (when did you get like this?)\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? (when did you get like this?)\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me (when did you get like this?)\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? Hey (I don't know)\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey (when did you get like this?)\n\nWhen the last time you think 'bout me? (I don't know)\n\nProlly the last time the drinks on me, hey"
