  "lyrics": "Alchemy is a spiritual art, a divine… secret… science\r\nI pulled the sword from the stone, sat down on my throne\r\nMeditatin' like a monk in the zone\r\nFrom my DNA strands locked deep in my bones\r\nI extract on the track, make a million Ap clones\n\nThey got the earth under their spell with smartphones\n\nHypnotized in a trance a society of ants\n\nNo chance to advance, was raised on food stamps\n\nI'm a government cheese baby with hand-me-down pants\n\nFall deep into the spell, take a seat this is Hell\n\nPeople who remain asleep can't rebel\n\nListen to the voice when you hear a ringin' bell\n\nGo to the village square throw poison in the well\n\nFluoridation, radio station, radiation\n\nRadios transmit poison to the nation\n\nStupid motherfuckers think just 'cause I'm a mason\n\nThat I'm Illuminati or somethin' to do with Satan\n\nYour brain's been infected, the broke skippin' record\n\nY'all are just sheep who follow a different shepherd\n\nWatch what you read it was written by a man\n\nI be spittin' certain shit only few can understand\n\nLike knowledge of the Gnostics, Manly P. Hall\n\nI intercept it 'cause my family see all\n\nAt 33 Jesus turned water into wine\n\n33 degrees, 33 vertebrae in the spine\n\nI'm Mecca, Kabbalistic science from the future\n\nBuilt the pyramids with a deity's computer\n\nBack on the block with the thieves and the lepers\n\nLoad MACs and set it off on tax collectors\n\nSneak under the fences in off-limit sectors\n\nStick up the Kings for their nice gold sceptres\n\nHood shit, everybody smokin' on that good shit\n\nPagan rituals around the fire keep the woods lit\n\n\n\nAncient philosophy and science derived a great deal of symbolical knowledge and insight from the study of the human body\n\n\n\nBlack cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black\n\nIt must have been a straight up deal for all who started all that\n\nYou got me hypnotized\n\nSomehow your words just hypnotize me\n\nGot me hypnotized\n\nSomehow your words just hypnotize me\n\n\n\nBorn in the ocean but I crawled to the shore\n\nWent back underwater when they started up the war\n\nAnd the bombs spread poison and the city went dark\n\nSinners dropped dead when they opened up the Ark\n\nWise men gathered in a circle to discuss\n\nWhich leader they could trust, which deceiver they would crush\n\nPraying in six thousand five hundred languages\n\nCouldn't give a scientific answer to the atheist\n\nDraw a circle with a five pointed star\n\nFive points on the pyramid and letters in Allah\n\nArm, leg, leg, arm, head, armed to to teeth\n\nPut the armor piercin' bullets in the clip when there's beef\n\nLet the sun shine pull the blindfolds off\n\nBitch rappers don't like me 'cause they rhyme so soft\n\nAnd I'm so much the opposite, louder than a bomb\n\nI'm the lord, I'm your shepherd, I'm your 23rd psalm\n\nThat's word to your mom 'til the earth's all gone\n\nIn the booth spittin' truth, every verse, every song\n\nMegahertz, megaton, Metaverse, Metatron\n\nI traverse tree of life, bounce like the Dogons\n\nThrough your stargate, supernovas onto your star shape\n\nElders try to tell us that we can't escape our fate\n\nWere far from the days where they stargaze\n\nNow we man ships that absorb cosmic rays\n\nOver the radio, talkin' hoes into fellatio\n\nSapiosexual so I kicked the golden ratio\n\nTransmittin' like the last man livin'\n\nSo my writtens hold more weight than King James editions\n\nCharles Dickens and Lord Francis Bacon\n\nBelieve in the creator but I don't believe in Satan\n\nI believe the Devil's a Homo sapien\n\nAnd Heaven and Hell exist in your cranium\n\n\n\nBlack cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black\n\nIt must have been a straight up deal for all who started all that\n\nYou got me hypnotized\n\nSomehow your words just hypnotize me\n\nGot me hypnotized\n\nSomehow your words just hypnotize me\n\n\n\nBut man can achieve nothing by himself. To accomplish the alchemical work, you will have these companions. They are thieves like you, but on another level. They are the most powerful people on the planet\n\n\n\nYo DJ Richie Rich and Pete Rock gonna be there\n\nSo what?\n\nSo!? They been all over the place man. Everybody know them, you're just local\n\nLocal!\n\nHahaha!"
