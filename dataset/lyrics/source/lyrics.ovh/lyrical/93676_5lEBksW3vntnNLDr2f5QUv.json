  "lyrics": "Crazy, stupid love birds\r\nCupid struck us, now we're falling out\r\nDrove in silence, put on mileage\r\nFive years wasted, I let you down\r\n’Cause we don't talk about what we know\n\nHolding on to our egos 'til we both agree we’ve had enough\n\nSince we've stopped, I can't help but eavesdrop\n\nHolding hands in treetops used to be our thing 'til we had enough\n\n\n\nTwo stones skipping, my heart dripping\n\nOur hands slipping out of reach\n\nMy bed's empty, I've said plenty\n\nNow words just fall from the peaks\n\n\n\nDigital telepathy, I wish you were next to me\n\nWhy are you my enemy? Yeah\n\nWe're wasting all this energy, overdose on empathy\n\nLove will be the enemy\n\n\n\n'Cause we don’t talk about what we know\n\nHolding on to our egos ’til we both agree we've had enough\n\nSince we’ve stopped, I can't help but eavesdrop\n\nHolding hands in treetops used to be our thing 'til we had enough\n\n\n\nThere's rain that’s falling down, I hate these silent sounds\n\nWhen I go days without hearing you speak out loud\n\nSo I get why this is hard, the end is never far\n\nI'll tape my wounds and hopefully find someone new\n\n\n\n'Cause we don't talk about what we know\n\nHolding on to our egos 'til we both agree we've had enough\n\nSince we've stopped, I can't help but eavesdrop\n\nHolding hands in treetops used to be our thing 'til we had enough"
