  "lyrics": "You call every night, the same time\r\n11:35 I wait by your street sign\r\nHeavy on my mind, an outline\r\nOn me in the shape of your lips\r\nAnd how could I let you\n\nGive me that tattoo?\n\nYou know I can’t believe it\n\nI can’t delete\n\nNow that I’m in your room I have to remind you\n\nThat I can keep your secret cause I’m good at keeping secrets\n\n\n\nWhen the night falls you know me so well\n\nI wait for you to sink your teeth in me\n\nThe night falls and you drag me through hell\n\n(But somehow you keep me coming back)\n\nDon’t want to say you’re driving me crazy\n\nBut every day I find myself waiting\n\nThe night falls you know me so well\n\nThe night falls you drag me through hell\n\n\n\nYou know I’m the type, I wake up\n\nFocus on your eyes to make sure they’re still shut\n\nRight at morning light, I’m outside\n\nBut I can’t get you off of my skin\n\n\n\nSomehow you keep me coming back every night\n\nWith a smile on my face\n\nBut now that you know my name\n\nYou’ll never forget my name"
