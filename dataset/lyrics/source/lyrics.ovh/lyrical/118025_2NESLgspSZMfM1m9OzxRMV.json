I... need your love, need your love\r\nTaste in your tongue, oh, the smoke in your lungs\r\nAnd I... need your love, and I... need your love\r\nThe salt on your skin is pulling me in\r\nAnd I... need your love, and I... need your love\n\n\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye to another night\n\nAnd watch you walk away\n\nI don't wanna let it burn in the city lights\n\nAnd make the same mistakes\n\n\n\nThis time\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night\n\n\n\nThe scratch in your voice leaves me no choice\n\nAnd I... won't give up, and I... can't give up\n\n\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye to another night\n\nAnd watch you walk away\n\nI don't wanna let it burn in the city lights\n\nAnd make the same mistakes\n\n\n\nThis time\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night\n\n\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye to another night\n\nI don't wanna let it burn in the city lights\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye to another night\n\nAnd watch you walk away\n\nI don't wanna let it burn in the city lights\n\nAnd make the same mistakes\n\n\n\nThis time\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night\n\n(Don't wanna waste the night)\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste the night\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\nI don't wanna waste it, don't wanna waste it\n\n(Waste it, waste it, waste it...)"
