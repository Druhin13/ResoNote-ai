  "lyrics": "I wish I was younger\r\nThe fat kid with the big, blue eyes full of wonder\r\nNo shame, no fame, no worries, the king of wiffle ball (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\r\nWithout a care at all\r\nI wish I was younger\r\nKeeping track of the lightning strikes and the thunder\n\nBarely thirteen, no hurry, my feet over the wall (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nIt doesn't matter if I fall\n\n\n\nI wish I was younger\n\nI wish I was younger\n\n\n\nI wish I was younger\n\nBarbies and fashion shows with my brother\n\nSo clear, no fear, no bullies, I didn't even know (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nWhere did all that magic go?\n\nI remember third grade, shades, new rollerblades\n\n4 foot 2, feeling 10 foot 8\n\nClassic Mario\n\nI remember charades, your braids, my first date\n\nWorking at the pool, barely ever getting paid\n\nDo you remember those days?\n\nI wish I was younger\n\nGetting high with my friends outside in the summer\n\nNever cool, never had a lot of money, but damn we had it all (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nWe had it all\n\n\n\nI wish I was younger\n\nI wish I was younger\n\nI wish I was younger\n\n\n\nI wish I was younger\n\nButterflies in my chest when I asked for your number\n\nYou smiled and said, \"you're funny\"\n\nTwo words and I was gone (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nYou wrote it on my arm (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nI swear, we set off the alarm (oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\n\n\nDo you remember making out in the stands?\n\nShowing up late and getting kicked out of bands?\n\nPoor Mr. Kafer never could understand\n\nJust take me back to who I was when I was younger\n\nDo you remember riding home in the rain?\n\nThat Sunday morning, playing songs about Jane?\n\nAnd from that moment I was never the same\n\nJust take me back to who I was when I was younger\n\nJust take me back to who I was when I was younger\n\nJust take me back to who I was when I was younger"
