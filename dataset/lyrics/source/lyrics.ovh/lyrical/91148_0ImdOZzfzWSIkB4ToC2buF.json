We were born to die\n\nHallelujah! Chica chica ride\n\nGonna fool ya with them white lines\n\nTo all my friends who've had enough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nTo all my friends who've had it rough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nWe'll pick you up\n\nTo all my friends who are just like me\n\nAnother face, another nobody\n\nLies are cheap but the truth ain't free\n\nIt just don't mean nothing to me\n\nTo all the ones who aren't good enough\n\nTo everybody that don't measure up\n\nLife is rough, are you rough enough?\n\nIt just don't mean nothing to me\n\nGot a belly full of that pesticide\n\nYeah, ain't it cool? We were born to die\n\nHallelujah! Chica chica ride\n\nGonna fool ya with them white lines\n\nTo all my friends who've had enough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nTo all my friends who've had it rough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nWe'll pick you up\n\nSmoke em if ya got em\n\nCuz we're not to be forgotten\n\nA broke future don't mean our hearts gotta turn rotten\n\nOur backs tied to a land slide got us crawling\n\nCallin' out to the lost and the fallen\n\nTo all my friends who've had enough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nTo all my friends who've had enough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nTo all my friends who've had it rough\n\nIf you should fall, we'll pick you up\n\nWe'll pick you up\n\nWe'll pick you up"
