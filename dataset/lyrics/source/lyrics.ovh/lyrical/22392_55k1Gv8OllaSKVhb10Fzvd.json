  "lyrics": "You are the last light over the mountain\r\nBleeding into the waves\r\nYou are the last dancing over the whitewash\r\nReflecting all the waves\r\nAnd I am nothing but your witness\r\nI watch on in awe\n\nI want nothing but to listen\n\nWhere you walk I will walk\n\n\n\nYou\n\n\n\nI do nothing but think of you\n\nAnd if it's true that you're gone then I am to\n\nBecause wherever you go I'm there\n\nI hope you knew that before you left\n\nI do nothing but think of you\n\n\n\nYou are the first star in the night sky\n\nYou're the spark at the tip of the flame\n\nI have seen your eyes in everything\n\nAnd they wink as if to say\n\n\n\nWe are eternal don't be afraid\n\nWe are eternal\n\n\n\nI do nothing but think of you\n\nAnd if it's true that you're gone then I am to\n\nBecause wherever you go I'm there\n\nI hope you knew that before you left\n\nI do nothing but think of you\n\n\n\nAnd I live in hope though that I know that I won't ever hold your hand\n\nThat this life is a limitless cosmic dance\n\nAnd we cry and we see for the life you lived\n\nTill you make your return\n\nI am forever changed\n\nI'll wait to see you again\n\n\n\nI do nothing but think of you\n\nAnd if it's true that you're gone then I am to\n\nBecause wherever you go I'm there\n\nI hope you knew that before you left\n\n\n\nI live to honour you\n\nI sing to honour you"
