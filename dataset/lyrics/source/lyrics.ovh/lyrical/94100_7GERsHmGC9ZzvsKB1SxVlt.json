  "lyrics": "Like, it's, it's impossible to count\r\nOne, two, three, four\r\nDrinking cold, black coffee\r\nI shake and shake, still won't get off me\r\nAnother blissed out fantasy\n\nWhere animals and objects talk to me\n\nAlways try and hate it\n\nBut then you laugh, it sounds outrageous\n\nSpend another day sleepwalking\n\n\n\nIs this having fun?\n\nOr is it just because?\n\nWhich one is jumping first\n\nOff of the face of the earth?\n\n\n\nYou like beer and chocolate\n\nI like setting off those bottle rockets\n\nWe can never compromise\n\nBut fighting 'til the death keeps us alive\n\nWhy don't you stay\n\nIf you're going to leave your car here anyway?\n\nSpend another summer shit-talking\n\n\n\nIs this having fun?\n\nIt's not like the way it was\n\nI thought that you loved this stuff\n\nOr did I make that up?\n\n\n\nAct insane, playing it safe\n\nI wasn't sold on that plan anyways\n\nFeeling afraid of making a change\n\nHoping to last another day\n\nI want there to stop the circular dots\n\nSpin in a whirlpool of forget-me-nots\n\nI gave what I got\n\nIt came as a shock\n\nTo find out I'm fine with what I've lost"
