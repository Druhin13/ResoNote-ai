  "lyrics": "I didn't notice anything strange\r\nBut the picture in your picture frame\r\nIt was drawn of a fountain in your body\r\nBought for a fiver most probably\r\nDidn't mean a lot to me, a lot to me\n\nYou tell me that you'd never sell this\n\nThat the artist himself was beneath this\n\nThat life itself is within this\n\nAnd I looked at the sky to worship the ground\n\n\n\nAnd you never asked for nothing at all\n\nBut you asked me to close your door\n\nAnd you do your best to fold me and unfold me again\n\n\n\nTime will make fools of us all\n\nIt's time to find meaning or control\n\nEvery time we go out now you pretend\n\nPretends we're not lovers, just friends\n\nAnd it gets to me, gets to me\n\n\n\nTell me the meaning of life is\n\nTo be happy and to give up loss\n\nBut you've never lost something you loved\n\nBut I turn around\n\nHow could I be angry at you?\n\n\n\nWhen you never asked for nothing at all\n\nBut you asked me to close your door\n\nAnd you do your best to fold me and unfold me again\n\nAnd it gets to me, gets to me\n\n\n\nTell me the meaning of life is\n\nTo be happy and to give up loss\n\nBut you've never lost something you loved\n\nBut I turn around\n\nHow could I be angry at you?\n\n\n\nWhen you never asked for nothing at all\n\nBut you asked me to come in from the cold\n\nAnd you do your best as you fold me and unfold me again\n\nAnd your never asked for nothing at all"
