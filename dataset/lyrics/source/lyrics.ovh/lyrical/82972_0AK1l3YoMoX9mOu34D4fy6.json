  "lyrics": "The hardest lesson for me.\r\nThrough the pain, through it all.\r\nWas love is not possession.\r\nI had to let you fall.\r\nI know you have your needs.\r\nBut did you ever see?\n\nThe fact I felt the need for you.\n\nWas there a need for me?\n\n\n\nTell me what you know.\n\nThe time I let it go.\n\n\n\nAnd if I burn down the city,\n\nWould you put out the flame?\n\nOr if it all ends in ashes,\n\nWould you still say my name?\n\nTell me, did you feel the same?\n\n\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n\n\nThe next time I get to heaven,\n\nI'll make sure I'm not there alone.\n\nGot so caught up in emotion.\n\nDidn't realize you might be gone.\n\nYou treat love so carelessly.\n\nDon't think you'll ever see.\n\nThe fact I felt the need for you.\n\nWas there a need for me?\n\n\n\nTell me what you know.\n\nThe time I let it go.\n\n\n\nAnd if I burn down the city,\n\nWould you put out the flame?\n\n(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?)\n\nOr if it all ends in ashes,\n\nWould you still say my name?\n\n(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?)\n\n\n\nAnd if I burn down the city,\n\n(If it burns.)\n\nWould you put out the flame?\n\n(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?)\n\nOr if it all ends in ashes,\n\nWould you still say my name?\n\n(Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?)\n\nTell me, did you feel the same?\n\n\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya? (x8)\n\n\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n(Did you feel the same?)\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n(Did you feel the same?)\n\n(Did you feel the same?)\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n(Oooooh)\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n(Feel the same)\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n(Haaaaah)\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya, do ya feel the same?\n\nDo ya, do ya, do ya?\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Fox 627 for these lyrics)"
