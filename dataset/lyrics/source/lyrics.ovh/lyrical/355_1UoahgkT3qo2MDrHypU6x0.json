  "lyrics": "There're all kinds of roses\r\nBut none are as handsome as the ones\r\nThat you own hands have grown\r\nThey bring as much hope\r\nLeave as much satisfaction\r\nAs anything I've ever known\n\n\n\nBut it ain't in their petals\n\nThat I'm seeking her fortune\n\nIt's in the weeds and the hedges and lawns\n\nOf the fortunate people\n\nWho can stand in their gardens\n\nAnd feel only time marching on\n\n\n\nWith the world on a string\n\nTo remind them of where they can go\n\nAnd what they oughta be\n\nWithout a whole lot to say\n\nTo the fella they pay\n\nTo cut the grass growing underneath their feet\n\n\n\nA rose can't see its own beauty\n\nOr feel what it's meant to symbolize\n\nIt doesn't stop and smell anything on its journey\n\nFrom the soil to the light\n\nJust wants the best for itself and its family\n\nAnd God help me so do I\n\nAnd so does everybody\n\nSo I head out each morning\n\nWith a smile and a wave\n\nFor whomever looks up from their work\n\n'Cause who knows in a while\n\nIt could be my own child\n\n\n\nWith the world on a string\n\nTo remind her of where they can go\n\nAnd what she oughta be\n\nWithout a whole lot to say\n\nTo the fella she pays\n\nTo cut the grass growing underneath her feet\n\n\n\nMay green grow the grass undernath our children's feet"
