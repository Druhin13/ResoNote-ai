  "lyrics": "I know this was my fault but\r\nHow much should it cost\r\nTo make things right\r\nDo I have to pay for life\r\nWe all fall short sometimes\r\nAnd I'm guilty of that crime\n\nBut I just wanna make you see\n\nThat you can still believe in me\n\nI know I make mistakes\n\nI am what I am I'm only a man\n\nSo don't take my joy away\n\nDon't turn your back on me\n\nSpeak to me let me know how you feel\n\nIf you feel like you can hold on and be strong\n\nI will never leave you lonely\n\nI cry sometimes cause I make you cry\n\nAnd that ain't right\n\nI won't make the same mistake twice\n\nBaby please forgive me\n\nNo I can't erase the wrong I've done\n\nBut I hope you can give me another chance\n\nCause if you were me you would want the same\n\nAnd I'd give that chance to you"
