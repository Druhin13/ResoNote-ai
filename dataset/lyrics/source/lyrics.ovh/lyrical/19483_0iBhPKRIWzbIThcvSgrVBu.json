  "lyrics": "And that's just the way it goes\r\nAs we journey through the land of the yellow rose\r\nOf course, we find\r\nUnprecedented capability to make this young love grow\r\nWe might just find ourselves washed on the shores of a new beginning\r\nA new love, new eventual heart break\n\nSome things heal, some things bleed forever\n\nThis is yesterday's tomorrow night"
