  "lyrics": "Get this feeling i'm a bad man\r\nBut i haven't done that much wrong\r\nStill honey drips in my lungs\r\nAnd its twisting up my tounge\r\nWho waits for my soul at the gates\n\nWill he take control could i escape\n\nWill he feel my cold or will he fake it\n\nWill he see my loss and still embrace me\n\nSo you want 2000 begging angels\n\nTo take your soul down and marry your fate to\n\nThe ones who love you not the ones who hate\n\nYou know they don't deserve you\n\n\n\nFeel it in my belly\n\nFeel it in my lungs\n\nPoison got me steady\n\nPocket full of gum\n\nPeel it in my belly\n\nFeel it in my lungs\n\nPocket full of jelly\n\nPoison in my lungs"
