  "lyrics": "This is a story 'bout a poor girl, a story that you ought to know\r\nShe lived all alone in a one room flat on a street where the lights are low\r\nEvery night about the same time she'd go and put her glad rags on\r\nGo to the place where everyone goes to Boogaloo all night long\r\nShe's a poor girl\n\nBorn and raised in the country she got tired of pushing a plow\n\nShe take my train to the city and mother you should look at her now\n\nWith her rattlesnake boots, elephant bag, genuine crocodile hat\n\nAround her neck to top it off she even wears a persian cat\n\nShe's a poor girl\n\n\n\nThat was the story of the poor girl but now she uses her head\n\nShe's back home working on the land instead of playing in bed\n\nThe fast life she was living took her as it's prey\n\nNow she's back in the country getting fatter every day\n\nShe's a Poor Girl"
