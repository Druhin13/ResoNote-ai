  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Contagious par Dante Klein\r\nI don't do this often\nSecond chances just ain't my typ\nDidn't feel like falling again\nBut you win, my head is spinning\n\nAnd the music's loud\nBut my heart beats louder, louder\nBaby, I ain't proud\nAll the pain that you gave me, it's fading\n\nThe way you move is contagious\nBaby, I just can't hate you, no, no\nThe way you move is contagious\n'Cause when you're close to my waist\nI'm falling too far to save\nThe way you move is contagious\n\n\nSo sick of this feeling\n2 A.M. and I'm begging for more\nMaking bad decisions again\nBut you win, my head is spinning\n\nAnd the music's loud\nBut my heart beats louder, louder\nBaby, I ain't proud\nAll the pain that you gave me, it's fading\n\nThe way you move is contagious\nBaby, I just can't hate you, no, no\nThe way you move is contagious\n'Cause when you're close to my waist\nI'm falling too far to save\nThe way you move is contagious\n\n\nKnew from the second I saw you that I was gone\nSo why would I fight\nThe attraction is way too strong\nAnd I don't do this often\nBut you're making me want it\n\nThe way you move is contagious\nBaby, I just can't hate you, no, no\nThe way you move is contagious\n'Cause when you're close to my waist\nI'm falling too far to save\nThe way you move is contagious"
