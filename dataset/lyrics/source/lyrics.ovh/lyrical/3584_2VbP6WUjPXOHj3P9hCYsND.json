  "lyrics": "Okay-kay-kay\r\nStudy facts, I put baby paw in the dirt like puppy tracks, yo\r\nI was runnin' up in sacks slow\r\nHaunted mind, now I'm on another plateau\r\nMy entrance, fly Benzes, knives, wrenches\n\nHotlines and suicide preventions\n\nI fight in trenches, you hide behind fences\n\nAnd ride benches\n\nMy mind's bright, yours is dense like Mike Pence's\n\nI amplify the five senses\n\nSo ahead of my time, I don't speak in the right tenses\n\nBig headed, I better try the wide lenses\n\nQuite pretentious, boss like my mic, got a life sentence\n\n\n\nDon't lose your cool or show your cards too early\n\nOr it could be a close call like New York-New Jersey\n\nI always had a soft spot for chicks who talk dirty\n\nParty on your block? Goin' 7:30\n\nAh, all you new aspirin' artists wish in the wind\n\nAgain any secret agents is listenin' in\n\nBest bet, mind your neck, go and find the check\n\nAhem, time for wreck\n\nMove over a smidgin, to avoid collision\n\nVillain, one truth, won't argue no religion\n\nOr promote no division, big business like prison\n\nNever fall victim to indecision or no bogus inhibition\n\nOne world government, me say, \"One world love for shit\"\n\nOr one girl shovin' it, lovin' it, pink button keep on rubbin' it\n\nHotter than an oven get\n\nSome rappers is fake prophets, tryna pull a fast one\n\nCaught on quick though, remember from the last one\n\nStayin' bent, it's chain event, Olympian\n\nReadin' Corinthians in a whip a pimp be in\n\n\n\nDear God, it's\n\nDear God, it's\n\n\n\nFireman, I throw flames, like I'm in the arcade with no change\n\nI ain't playin' no games, I'm an animal, they let me off the chain\n\nStill ride the underground railroad, get aboard the train\n\nSomebody tell the label exec\n\n\"Don't forget, there's penalties and fees when you late with the check\"\n\nMatter fact take the payment in cash, I stay woke\n\nLike seven cups of coffee, straight out the bag\n\nThat's some hard shit, sharp like the razor, choppin' bricks\n\nGet the party lit, lush get crushed like cigar split\n\nFeel it through your spine, I'm the sickest you'll find\n\nI display more marvelous art than Guggenheim\n\nNo words to define me buddy\n\nMy previous work is under research and scientist study\n\nCode name: prototype\n\nBet the DOOM vs. CZARFACE album have 'em open like a photo light\n\n\n\nDear God, it's\n\nDear God, it's\n\n\n\nSo easy"
