  "lyrics": "Sick of being innocent\r\nSick of being ignorant too\r\nI was in it for the thrill of it\r\n'Til I started feeling the truth\r\nWhy'd you ever make me choose?\n\nI don't wanna be like you\n\nI thought I knew you but\n\nI never knew you would turn us into animals\n\nI don't wanna be like you\n\n\n\nRealize I was living in hell when I was given the news\n\nWhy'd you let the evil win?\n\nHow'd you let him sell it to you?\n\nI remember growing up mama used to sing me the blues\n\nAnd now the kids are making noise just because it's something to do, to do, yeah\n\n\n\nWhy'd you ever make me choose?\n\nI don't wanna be like you\n\nI thought I knew you, but I never knew you would turn us into animals\n\nI don't wanna be like you\n\nI don't wanna be like you\n\nI don't wanna be like you\n\n\n\nSo now I'm second guessing real life\n\nAnd if you left I still wouldn't feel right"
