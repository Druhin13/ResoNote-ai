  "lyrics": "Uh\r\nI EXIST\r\nSpoken in a confident voice\r\nCan world shift in continents hoist\r\nLook under for the plunder\r\nA rich man's song that gets sung for a sum out the lungs of a stunna\n\nBut life turns to a station and a hustler to hummer\n\nWent from speaking and now not even sinking\n\nThe game is karaoke ‘til it tries to punish poke me\n\nKinda throw me words, slowly fade the [?]\n\nWaving metal sheets make thunder\n\nFooling I was younger; fool me when I’m older\n\nFool me now, screw me down to the sofa\n\nTaking so much, drinking soda, eating vulture\n\nTweeting vulgar, playing mad and getting fat\n\nAnd getting cultured with the quotes\n\nIn the hopes people will get the jokes\n\nIf it rains you will get the float\n\nBut only if they're still building boats\n\n\n\nBut your values system says you believe in sleep more than you believe in grinding\n\nYour values system says you are a consumer and not a producer\n\nThat you're spending more money than you’re making\n\nWhy because you're a consumer\n\nYou're reading all the books and you're saying everything the books are saying\n\nBut those books are not in alignment with your values!\n\nAnd you're gonna go to the next level\n\nYour values are gonna have to change\n\n\n\nUh\n\nDrunken Fist versus Praying Mantis\n\nWas it God's plan or man mismanaged to turn New Orleans to Atlantis?\n\nThey lie in the streets to lambast\n\nThe black land swam at like a HE MAN in a bathtub\n\nFire! Cup up the bad blood\n\nHope hand thugs can write after the lackluster backrubs\n\nOr half structured, or tech hubs, or wack love\n\nThe [?] is a [?] in community chess\n\nGod said, “Don't you ruin me yet\n\nUntil I give them everything\n\nAnd there's just 2 of these left.”\n\nBlack bumper slow fades into a vista\n\nRapid cuts a stock footage which freezes on a listener\n\nGive me love, lovers!\n\nI read it like blood color on the head of a flooded structure\n\nCan’t keep the duck rubber under\n\nFundamentally it’s buoyant\n\nIt rises like court rooms to swoon for your enjoyment\n\n\n\nEvery single word you say\n\nWell you say it to me\n\nWell it stays with me\n\n\n\nI heard every single word you say\n\nWell you say it to me\n\nWell it stays with me\n\n\n\nTrap music meets trapezoids, fake his own death\n\nThey roll rocks like asteroids [?]\n\nThink outside the box\n\nI wrap a toy in a cheque\n\nThen watch a sissy fuss with a boy in a dress\n\nMad at the world\n\nIn a voice of a man, with a bag of a girl\n\nShe just avoids the success\n\nIt's what it said\n\nOr was she sad\n\nDouble entendre no matter how you play it\n\nThen he takes the sex tape and destroys the cassette\n\nAnd puts the ribbon in the sky like the [?]\n\nThen prepares to utter, what’s been a symbol in its [?]\n\nAgainst the ticker take scene\n\nIn a Silver Lake dream\n\nSorta orders the lungs to [?], screams\n\nShouts to [?] with [?] beams\n\nIn a blue sky filled with pornographic strings\n\nGetting caught up in the trees\n\nI still believe in Jesus!\n\n\n\nOur purpose is to ensure\n\nThat literature and art sit well\n\nInto the whole revolutionary machine\n\nAs a component part\n\nThat they operate as powerful weapons\n\nFor uniting and educating the people\n\nAnd for attacking and destroying the enemy\n\nAnd that they help the people fight the enemy\n\nWith one heart and one mind\n\n\n\nEvery single word you say\n\nWell you say it to me\n\nWell it stays with me\n\n\n\nI heard every single word you say\n\nWell you say it to me\n\nWell it stays with me\n\n\n\nEvery single word you say\n\nWell you say it to me\n\nWell it stays with me\n\n\n\nI heard every single word you say\n\nWell you say it to me\n\nWell it stays with me\n\n\n\nThere was a man who wrote many things\n\nBut Carlyle said, um, that we could not be ruined\n\nBecause no lie could live forever\n\nWilliam Cullen Bryan said, \"truth crushed to earth, would rise again”\n\nAnd James Russell Lowell, made it more plain\n\nThat we would not be ruined or destroyed\n\nBecause he said that\n\n“truth, forever on the scaffold, lies, forever on the throne\n\nBut that scaffold sways the future\n\nAnd, behind the dim unknown\n\nStandeth God within the shadow\n\nKeeping watch above his own”\n\nThese powerful scriptures were also used by the man\n\nIn whom we celebrate his birthday today, Dr Martin Luther King\n\nAnd Dr King told us to practice non-violence and the power of love\n\nNon-violence and the power of love has brought us thus far\n\nThe agape love that we have for ourselves\n\nThat we have for our people\n\nIs the reason why our people\n\nIn this particular diaspora called, North America\n\nHave not been totally ruined\n\nWe have not been totally destroyed\n\nWe have not been exterminated\n\nSo therefore, uh, my dear brother, um, who I salute\n\nWe thank you for what you've asked me to do\n\nAnd we shall continue to study to show ourselves approved under God\n\nWorkman that needn't not be ashamed\n\nRightly this dividing the word of truth\n\nAnd so at this time, in this city\n\nWhere young men's lives are not worth much\n\nIn this city where our people have been discriminated against\n\nAnd kept from the resources which we\n\nRightly deserve as a majority of people in the city\n\nWe are dependent upon the most high creator of the ends of the world\n\nThat I call Elohim Jehova\n\nAnd we are dependent upon him to keep us from falling\n\nTo keep us from being ruined\n\nTo keep us from being exterminated\n\nAnd we thank, the almighty, for the privilege of being here with my niece\n\nIs to impart these words, and I hope it would be of assistance in this project\n\nGod bless you and thank you"
