  "lyrics": "Like a jester at the ball\r\nRub my shoulders with the kings\r\nI was draped in gold and velvet\r\nBreathing in applause\r\nWhile I was jumping through the rings\n\nWhen the cooks would sound a bell\n\nAll kings would lick their lips\n\nBut I couldn't find a placemat\n\nDinner table's full\n\nAnd there's no room for me to sit\n\n\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\nJust say you want me\n\nJust say you need me\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\n\n\nLord, I live to entertain\n\nAll my pride is in my praise\n\nI hum along with this vibration\n\nAnd hope to God I make it\n\n\n\nIf any chord that I could strum\n\nMake me feel less like a man\n\nSlam my fingers in their doorway\n\nShatter all the bones\n\nSo I could never strum again\n\n\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\nJust say you want me\n\nJust say you need me\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\n\n\n'Cause every last soldier's fucking me over\n\nTears on their shoes and ice on their shoulders\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\n\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\nJust say you want me\n\nJust say you need me\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\n\n\nIs every last soul just fucking me over\n\nWith tears on their shoes and ice on their shoulders\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\nIs every last soul just fucking me over\n\nWith tears on their shoes and ice on their shoulders\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?\n\nIs every last soul just fucking me over\n\nWith tears on their shoes and ice on their shoulders\n\nIs there anybody out there looking out for me?"
