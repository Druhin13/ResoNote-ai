  "lyrics": "Listen, everyone\r\nThe time will come when all of us say goodbye\r\nFeel that aching in your heart\r\nLeaving you broken inside\r\nBut we're never really gone\r\nAs long as there's a memory in you mind\n\n\n\nSo now go do the best things in life\n\nTake a bite of this world while you can\n\nMake the most of the rest of your life\n\nMake a ride of this world while you can\n\n\n\nTake the ones you love\n\nAnd hold them close because there is little time\n\nAnd don't let it break your heart\n\nI know it feels hopeless sometimes\n\nBut they're never really gone\n\nAs long as there's a memory in you mind\n\n\n\nSo now go do the best things in life\n\nTake a bite of this world while you can\n\nMake the most of the rest of your life\n\nMake a ride of this world while you can\n\n\n\nAnd hold on to memories\n\nHold on to every moment\n\nTo keep them alive\n\nThe world's greatest tragedy\n\nSouls who are not remembered\n\nCannot survive\n\n\n\nSo now go do the best things in life\n\nBring the fight to this world while you can\n\nMake the most of the rest of your life\n\nShine your light on this world while you can\n\n\n\nAnd hold on to memories\n\nHold on to every moment\n\nTo keep them alive\n\nThe world's greatest tragedy\n\nSouls who are not remembered\n\nCannot survive\n\n\n\nAnd hold on to memories\n\nHold on to every moment\n\nTo keep them alive\n\nThe world's greatest tragedy\n\nSouls who are not remembered\n\nCannot survive"
