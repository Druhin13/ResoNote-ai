  "lyrics": "My baby ever treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rMy poor heart is sentimental not made of wood\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rBut when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'\rI end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out\rHe don't love me like I love him nobody could\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rLike alonely weeping willow lost in the wood\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rAnd the things I tell my pillow no woman should\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rTho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears\rI'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him\rLord above me make him love me the way he should\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rOriginal lyric\rThe poets say that all who love are blind\rBut I'm in love and I know what time it is!\rThe Good Book says \"Go seek and ye shall find\"\rWell, I have sought and my what a climb it is!\rMy life is just like the weather\rIt changes with the hours\rWhen he's near I'm fair and warmer\rWhen he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;\rin emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim\rWhen a woman loves a man like I love him.\rNever treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rMy poor heart is sentimental not made of wood\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rBut when the weekend's over and Monday rolls aroun'\rI end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out\rHe don't love me like I love him nobody could\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rLike alonely weeping willow lost in the wood\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rAnd the things I tell my pillow no woman should\rI got it bad and that ain't good!\rTho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears\rI'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him\rLord above me make him love me the way he should\rI got it bad and that ain't good!"
