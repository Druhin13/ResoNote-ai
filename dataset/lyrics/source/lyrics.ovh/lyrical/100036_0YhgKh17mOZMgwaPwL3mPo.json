  "lyrics": "Like a scream inside, the one you just can't hide\r\nSounds so deafening, you can't hear yourself think\r\nAs real as real can it\r\nKeeping my heart in check, from feeling anything but my own apathy\r\nAgain, again\n\nIt's creeping up on me\n\nMaking it harder to breathe\n\n\n\nWe're all under pressure\n\nCan't stand the weather\n\nFor the worst and not for the better\n\nPlease, this ain't the way to live\n\nSomething's got to give\n\nWe forgive but don't forget it, no\n\nAnother day, another battle\n\nWe all have a cage to rattle\n\nThis just might be the death of me\n\nMight be the death of me\n\n\n\nIt's reached a fever pitch\n\nI'm living proof of it\n\nI find it hard to cope, without a thread of hope\n\nBlood is thicker then water\n\nBut love is even stronger\n\nHold out a little longer\n\nUntil we found ourselves\n\nAgain, again\n\n\n\nIt's creeping up on me\n\nMaking it harder to breathe\n\n\n\nWe're all under pressure\n\nCan't stand the weather\n\nFor the worst and not for the better\n\nPlease, this ain't the way to live\n\nSomething's got to give\n\nWe forgive but don't forget it, no\n\nAnother day, another battle\n\nWe all have a cage to rattle\n\nThis just might be the death of me\n\nMight be the death of me\n\nAnother day, another battle\n\nWe all have a cage to rattle\n\nThis just might be the death of me\n\nMight be the death of me\n\n\n\nLike a scream inside, the one you just can't hide\n\nSounds so defying, you can't hear yourself think\n\nAs real as real can it\n\nKeeping my heart in check from feeling anything\n\nMaking it harder to breathe\n\n\n\nWe're all under pressure\n\nCan't stand the weather\n\nFor the worst and not for the better\n\nPlease, this ain't the way to live\n\nSomething's got to give\n\nWe forgive but don't forget it, no\n\nAnother day, another battle\n\nWe all have a cage to rattle\n\nThis just might be the death of me\n\nMight be the death of me\n\nAnother day, another battle\n\nWe all have a cage to rattle\n\nThis just might be\n\nYeah, this might be the death of me"
