  "lyrics": "The days blur into one\r\nAnd I float around the edge of them\r\nSearching for something\r\nThat'll make me feel alive again\r\nThese past few weeks in a hell of my own creation\r\nI try vegan food, I take up meditation\n\n\n\nI hope you're doing fine on your own\n\n'Cause after everything we've been through\n\nYou better hope\n\nYou'll find someone, and you'll try, but you won't\n\n'Cause after everything we've been through\n\nOh baby, I wanna know\n\n\n\nWhat you were thinking\n\nWhen you saw me in the produce section\n\nBuying organic food\n\nMaking healthy selections\n\nI asked you how you've been\n\nNot that it's any of my business\n\nBut you know me I've always been a little masochistic\n\n\n\nI hope you're doing fine on your own\n\n'Cause after everything we've been through\n\nYou better hope\n\nYou'll find someone, and you'll try, but you won't\n\n'Cause after everything we've been through\n\nOh baby, I wanna know\n\n\n\nI hope somehow I never see you again\n\nAnd if I do it's at your funeral or better yet\n\nI hope the world explodes\n\nI hope that we all die\n\nWe can watch the highlights in hell\n\nI hope they're televised\n\n\n\nI hope you're doing fine on your own\n\n'Cause after everything we've been through\n\nYou better hope\n\nYou'll find someone, and you'll try, but you won't\n\n'Cause after everything we've been through\n\nOh baby, I wanna know"
