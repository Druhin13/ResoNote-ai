  "lyrics": "I picked you up\r\nI picked the place, I couldn't wait to show you off on my arm\r\nI held the door, I held your hand, even hung your jacket on the back of your chair at the bar\r\nBut I just remembered I forgot one thing\r\nNever got that kiss before we got out the car\n\nYou know, I know\n\nThe right way to treat a woman\n\nWhen everybodys lookin' but I, I can't lie (no)\n\nWhen you put your hand there on my knee\n\nAnd get that look up in your eyes\n\n\n\nA crowded room don't mean a thing and I don't mean to cause a scene\n\nIf you want to we can leave but girl, right now\n\nI don't care who sees (I was leanin' in for a kiss, I'm givin' in)\n\nEven though it ain't like me\n\n\n\nYou see that couple on the right?\n\nNo they ain't thinkin' twice\n\nCause all I'm thinkin' baby, why should we\n\nCause everybody here can tell, that I just can't help myself\n\nIf they could see the way you look at me, Oh\n\n\n\nYou know, I know, yeah\n\nThe right way to treat a woman\n\nWhen everybodys lookin' but I, I can't lie (no)\n\nWhen you put your hand there on my knee\n\nAnd get that look up in your eyes\n\n\n\nA crowded room don't mean a thing and I don't mean to cause a scene\n\nIf you want to we can leave but girl, right now\n\nI don't care who sees (I was leanin' in for a kiss, I'm givin' in)\n\nEven though it ain't like me\n\n\n\nI don't care, I don't care\n\nI ain't tryin' to spotlight\n\nYeah, all I'm sayin' is, we ain't gotta hide it\n\n\n\nBut you know, I know, yeah\n\nThe right way to treat a woman\n\nWhen everybodys lookin' but I, I can't lie (no)\n\nWhen you put your hand there on my knee\n\nAnd get that look up in your eyes\n\n\n\nA crowded room don't mean a thing and I don't mean to cause a scene\n\nIf you want to we can leave but girl, right now\n\nI don't care who sees (I was leanin' in for a kiss, I'm givin' in)\n\n(I was leanin' in for another kiss, I'm givin' in)\n\n\n\nI don't care who sees\n\n(I just wanna know if I'm comin' on, a little strong)\n\nAnd Girl that's just between you and me, and I don't care who sees"
