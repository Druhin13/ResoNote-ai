  "lyrics": "Yeah I could die happy for a moment\r\nHappy 'cause you stole my spare time\r\nI met a girl, she had expensive perfume\r\nWas a waste of money, didn't smell so lovely like you\r\nAnd now you're on my steps up late night\n\nChain smoking Pallmalls while I philosophize\n\n\n\nGlass sky, killin' time\n\nYou leaned upon my shoulder\n\nAnd my thoughts dried\n\nDidn't mind\n\nSo alive\n\n\n\nI felt like I could die\n\nHappy for a moment\n\nHappy 'cause you stole\n\nMy spare time\n\nYeah I could die\n\nNow that I've been falling\n\nHigh upon the smoke in your eyes\n\n\n\nAnd I've been burned yeah\n\nAnd I've burned myself\n\nSaw no point in falling\n\nJust to burn somebody else\n\nBut now your dreams are catching my eye\n\nMaybe we could stay up and pretend for a while\n\n\n\nGlass sky, killing time\n\nYou leaned upon my shoulder\n\nAnd my thoughts dried\n\nDidn't mind\n\nSo alive\n\n\n\nI felt like I could die\n\nHappy for a moment\n\nHappy 'cause you stole\n\nMy spare time\n\nYeah I could die\n\nNow that I've been falling\n\nHigh upon the smoke in your eyes\n\n\n\nAnd in the darkness we leave our bodies\n\nLeave our bodies, so alive\n\n\n\nSo alive\n\nI felt like I could die\n\nHappy for a moment\n\nHappy 'cause you stole\n\nMy spare time\n\nYeah I could die\n\nNow that I've been falling\n\nHigh upon the smoke in your eyes\n\n\n\nDie, die, die happy"
