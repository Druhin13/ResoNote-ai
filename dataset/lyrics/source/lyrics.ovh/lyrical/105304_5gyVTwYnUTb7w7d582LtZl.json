  "lyrics": "Unconditional love\r\nAnd a lack of patience\r\nIs what you gave me\r\nYou say I worry too much\r\nWhile you dig up habits\r\nBuried deep within me\n\n\n\nMy temper's cutting through to call you out\n\nIt makes me sick inside to know\n\n\n\nYou let me down but you never let me go\n\nTell me when you lost control\n\nMy heart beats fast as time moves slow\n\nYou let me down but you never let me go\n\nLet me go\n\n\n\nThe hand that eats to feed\n\nNo mouth wide open\n\nIt's all so different\n\nExcuses hold up the walls\n\nThat keep you hidden\n\nI don't see progress\n\n\n\nWe're drowning slowly in the shallow end\n\nIt makes me sick inside to know\n\n\n\nYou let me down but you never let me go\n\nTell me when you lost control\n\nMy heart beats fast as time moves slow\n\nYou let me down but you never let me go\n\nLet me go\n\n\n\nSpare me the uncertainty and blank stares\n\n'Cause I can't cope\n\nSpare me the anxiety it's not fair\n\nAnd let me go\n\n\n\nUnconditional love\n\nAnd a lack of patience\n\nIs what you gave me\n\n\n\nYou let me down but you never let me go\n\nTell me when you lost control\n\nMy heart beats fast as time moves slow\n\nYou let me down but you never let me go\n\nLet me go\n\nSo let me go"
