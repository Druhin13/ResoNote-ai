  "lyrics": "The fire's growing stronger as it changes direction (Can you feel my [?])\r\nAs animals secretly wish our destruction (They watch and wait)\r\nThe city we've abandoned, burnt away in the distance (We are no one)\r\nLike stray dogs left behind to wait for dead masters, long gone\r\nBehold the fields of fire as they cleanse our infection (And conquer all)\n\nLet smoke and suffocation be the peace that you offer (The lonely one)\n\nAnd California dreamers and skeletons wander (In lithium)\n\nLike gasoline and crucifix, Roman candles and the 4th of July\n\n\n\nA black fire [?] we dance, we pay\n\nThe [?] drown out and the lovers pray\n\nThe sun is gone and the moon is high\n\nThe ones who lead and the ones who have died\n\n[?] gone away\n\nThis black I feel [?]\n\nNo words are left, forbidden song\n\nAbout how we live and we die alone"
