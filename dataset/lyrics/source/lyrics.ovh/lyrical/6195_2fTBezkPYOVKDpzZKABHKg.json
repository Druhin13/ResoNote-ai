  "lyrics": "Every day's the same\r\nFeeling every shade of grey\r\nPlaying by the rules when you wanna be led astray\r\nGonna miss that train, don't take me home\r\nI've got all I need right here\n\nSoaking up the sound, gonna wash it all away\n\n\n\nRaining glitter down on us tonight\n\nCovering us all in magic\n\nNever ever seen them stars so bright\n\nAs the look in your eyes\n\nRaining glitter down on us tonight\n\nNo more hiding in the shadows\n\nOoh, you look like diamonds in the light\n\nEverybody put your hands up to the sky\n\nAnd let it rain\n\n\n\nWe can let it rain\n\nLet it rain down silver and gold\n\nWe all want the same\n\nYeah we're looking for that hand to hold\n\nAnd a stolen kiss that feels so good that it might just change your world\n\nYou can call us fools, but these dreams will never get old\n\n\n\nRaining glitter down on us tonight\n\nCovering us all in magic\n\nNever ever seen them stars so bright\n\nAs the look in your eyes\n\nRaining glitter down on us tonight\n\nNo more hiding in the shadows\n\nOoh, you look like diamonds in the light\n\nEverybody put your hands up to the sky\n\nAnd let it rain\n\n\n\nThis is what it's about\n\nNever stop\n\n(Woop)\n\nSay my name, hold me tight\n\nIn the dark\n\n(Woop)\n\n'Cause we're not, no we're not giving up on love\n\n\n\nRaining glitter down on us tonight\n\nCovering us all in magic\n\nNever ever seen them stars so bright\n\nAs the look in your eyes\n\nRaining glitter down on us tonight\n\nNo more hiding in the shadows\n\nOoh, you look like diamonds in the light\n\nEverybody put your hands up to the sky\n\nAnd let it rain"
