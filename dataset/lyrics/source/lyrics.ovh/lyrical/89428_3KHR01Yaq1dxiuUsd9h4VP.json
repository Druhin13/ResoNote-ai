  "lyrics": "Wasn't long ago we were dancing in the sunshine\r\nThen the grey skies came and clouded our parade\r\nLet’s go back to a time before tears filled your eyes\r\nAnd I never said the things I didn't mean\r\nTell me how's the weather out in Tulsa?\n\nTell me now how is your Grandma Jean?\n\nHow’s that garden coming we planted in the springtime?\n\nTell me now is your thumb still green?\n\n\n\nAnd I can't tell you why the wind blows\n\nOr why the sun rises in the east\n\nWhy April showers fall from the sky\n\nOr what keeps you coming back to me\n\n\n\nOver and over, time and time again\n\nLong distance loving, longtime friend\n\nWhat keeps you grounded when you want to fly?\n\nWhat keeps your motor running when you feel it's going to die?\n\n\n\nI can't tell you why the wind blows\n\nOr why the sun rises in the east\n\nWhy April showers fall from the sky\n\nOr what keeps you coming back to me, Ohh\n\n\n\nLike waves keep coming from the sea\n\nYou keep coming back for me\n\n\n\nI can't tell you why the wind blows\n\nWhy colors fade and leaves fall from the trees\n\nWhy April showers fall from your eye\n\nOr what keeps you coming back\n\nWhat keeps you coming back\n\n\n\nI can't tell you why the wind blows\n\nOr why the sun rises in the east\n\nWhy April showers fall from the sky\n\nOr what keeps you coming back to me, Ohh\n\nWhat keeps you coming back to me"
