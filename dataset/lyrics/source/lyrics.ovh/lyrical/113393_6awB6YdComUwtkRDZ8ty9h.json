  "lyrics": "Songs to make you free\r\nAnd songs to take you to another time\r\nForgotten reasons that are made of rhyme\r\nFor you and me\r\nThe songs of life\r\nThat somehow make us free\n\n\n\nAnd songs to fill the heart\n\nLike quiet candles on a winter's night\n\nThey touch the space\n\nThat lies between you and I\n\nAnd I will sing\n\nThe songs of love\n\nThat speak to you and me\n\n\n\nThen wake the sleeping child\n\nAnd let me sing to you of other times\n\nAnd let me make your dreams\n\nAs sweet as mine\n\nAnd I will bring\n\nThe gift of song\n\nThat only makes us free"
