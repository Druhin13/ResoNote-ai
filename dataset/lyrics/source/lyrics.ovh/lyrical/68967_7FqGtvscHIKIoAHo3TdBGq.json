  "artist": "Ella Fitzgerald",
  "title": "Love Is Here To Stay",
  "lyrics": "The more I read the papers, the less I comprehend.\nThe world and all it's capers and how it all will end.\nNothing seems to be lasting, but that isn't our affair.\nWe've got something permanent,\nI mean in the way we care.\n\n\nIt's very clear our love is here to stay.\n\nNot for a year, but ever and a day.\n\nThe radio and the telephone.\n\nAnd the movies that we know.\n\nMay just be passing fancies and in time may go.\n\nBut, oh my dear, our love is here to stay.\n\nTogether were going a long, long way.\n\nIn time the rockies may crumble,\n\nGibraltar may tumble, they're only made of clay.\n\nBut our love is here to stay."
