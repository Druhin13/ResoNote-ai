  "lyrics": "Tongue tied and falling\r\nSo far from the ground\r\nThat's what you do to me\r\nAnd to you I'm bound\r\nMy heart was restless\r\nAnd I traveled alone\n\nBut you make each place I go\n\nFeel like home\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna be there, wherever you lead me\n\nFor better or worse, for the rest of my life\n\n\n\nIt won't ever rain on us\n\nIt won't ever get too rough\n\nYou know I can't promise you that\n\nBut I promise I won't look back\n\nNothing but happy days\n\nAnd nothing will ever change\n\nYou know I can't promise you that\n\nBut I promise I won't look back\n\n\n\nWon't look, won't look, won't look back\n\nWon't look, won't look, won't look back\n\n\n\nThere's nothing I'm leaving\n\nCan turn me around\n\nYou gave me direction\n\nWhen it could no be found\n\nAfter all the mistakes now\n\nAnd all our regrets\n\nKnowing the days left to come\n\nAre the best yet\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna be there, wherever you lead me\n\nFor better or worse, for the rest of my life\n\n\n\nIt won't ever rain on us\n\nIt won't ever get too rough\n\nYou know I can't promise you that\n\nBut I promise I won't look back\n\nNothing but happy days\n\nAnd nothing will ever change\n\nYou know I can't promise you that\n\nBut I promise I won't look back\n\n\n\nWon't look, won't look, won't look back\n\nWon't look, won't look, won't look back\n\nWon't look, won't look, won't look back\n\nWon't look, won't look, won't look back"
