  "lyrics": "I’m just asking for a friend\r\nBut it’s good to see you, good to see you again\r\nIs it the same stuff you had last time?\r\nIt really made me lose my mind\r\nI think it’s suspect you ever feel lonely at all\n\nYou’re faking\n\nYou’re faking the fall\n\nOoh\n\n\n\nYou’re not sentimental, but I’ve seen you cry\n\nIn the hotel room when were high\n\nSo why do I feel so exposed?\n\nWhen I’m the one who’s more composed\n\n\n\nIf memory’s selective\n\nAnd pain is all relative\n\nIt only sinks in when you’re above it, dear\n\n\n\nI think it’s suspect you ever feel lonely at all\n\nYou’re faking\n\nYou’re faking the fall\n\n(?) flowers plastered on the wall\n\nAnd expose a mirror (?)\n\nOoh"
