You may not have noticed\n\nWe have totally lost our way\n\nAre you lost in the clouds? Or can you hold your focus?\n\nIt’s ourselves that we will betray\n\nAre you listening? You may not have noticed\n\nWe have totally lost our way\n\nAre you lost in the clouds? Or can you hold your focus?\n\nIt’s ourselves that we will betray\n\n\n\nLike a bird in a cage, trying to fly away\n\nIs this the price that we have to pay?\n\nOverflowing with rage, yet we still obey\n\n'Cause we’re asleep in a hurricane\n\n\n\nWe sit on a throne, waiting for God to bend the knee\n\nBut we're nothing more than royal beggars\n\nYeah\n\nBut I'm as guilty as the next man\n\nOur eyes are open, but we're not listening"
