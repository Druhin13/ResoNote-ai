  "lyrics": "Shed your skin, days on years, punished by pressured time\r\nWhen underneath, you’re balancing all this hate and selfless misconception\r\nWhat once was full is just the husk of a deceived creature of habits Black ink can’t pierce this deep\r\nBy your side, I watched the birds of prey bind the skies and hold in wait\r\nWe cannot mend what is sealed by fate\n\nNo future, contentment with complacency, absorbing disappointment, bite the hand that feeds\n\nI gave up everything to make you feel complete\n\nDrenched in cold sweat from lost comfort of safety, you\n\nResonate with hatred\n\n\n\nMy pulse is racing in my chest\n\nI lie awake to imagine pathways of escape as they disappear\n\n\n\nAll these words mean nothing if we fall face first (if we fall face first) from running away from something that we saw coming\n\n\n\nEmbrace this sunset as cloak and dagger for you to cower\n\nHidden by shadow, with filthy nails of gripping cowards\n\nShed your skin\n\nRefuse to be loved by yourself to grow free from villainous vines Refuse love from anyone else to sever ties that have grown intertwined\n\n\n\nMy failing mind has been oppressed, and I lie awake to embrace a\n\nPathway of escape\n\nDisappear without a trace\n\n\n\nAll these words mean nothing if we fall face first (if we fall face first) from running away from something that we saw coming\n\n\n\nRise through the wake, sliding through the pulse of the ocean tide\n\nRise through the wake, sliding through the pulse of the ocean tide\n\nShed your skin!\n\nShed your skin, I’ve always known what’s underneath\n\nRise through the wake, or be the crashing waves\n\n\n\nRise through the wake, sliding through the pulse\n\nOf the ocean tide\n\nRise through the wake, slide\n\n\n\nRefuse to be loved by yourself to grow free from villainous vines\n\nRefuse love from anyone else to sever ties that have grown intertwined"
