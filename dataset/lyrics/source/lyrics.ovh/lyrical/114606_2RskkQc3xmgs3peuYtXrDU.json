  "lyrics": "Dirty old street all slushed up in the rain and snow\r\nLittle boy and his ma shivering outside a rundown music store window\r\nThat night on top of a Christmas tree shines one beautiful star\r\nAnd lying underneath a brand-new Japanese guitar\r\nI remember in the morning, ma, hearing your alarm clock ring\n\nI'd lie in bed and listen to you gettin' ready for work\n\nThe sound of your makeup case on the sink\n\nAnd the ladies at the office, all lipstick, perfume and rustlin' skirts\n\nAnd how proud and happy you always looked walking home from work\n\n\n\nIf pa's eyes were windows into a world so deadly and true\n\nYou couldn't stop me from looking but you kept me from crawlin' through\n\nAnd if it's a funny old world, mama, where a little boy's wishes come true\n\nWell I got a few in my pocket and a special one just for you\n\n\n\nIt ain't no phone call on Sunday, flowers or a mother's day card\n\nIt ain't no house on a hill with a garden and a nice little yard\n\nI got my hot rod down on Bond Street, I'm older but you'll know me in a glance\n\nWe'll find us a little rock 'n roll bar and baby we'll go out and dance\n\n\n\nWell it was me in my Beatle boots, you in pink curlers and matador pants\n\nPullin' me up of the couch to do the twist for my uncles and aunts\n\nWell I found a girl of my own now, ma, I popped the question on your birthday\n\nShe stood waiting on the front porch while you were telling me to get out there\n\nAnd say what it was that I had to say\n\n\n\nLast night we all sat around laughing at the things that guitar brought us\n\nAnd I layed awake thinking 'bout the other things it's brought us\n\nWell tonight I'm takin's requests here in the kitchen\n\nThis one's for you, ma, let me come right out and say it\n\nIt's overdue, but baby, if you're looking for a sad song, well I ain't gonna play it"
