  "lyrics": "There’s a pocket in my heart again\r\nAnd it’s keeping me awake\r\nFor all the reasons I can’t understand\r\nI run away\r\nThere are people that’ll take you down\n\nBut our hearts beat just the same\n\nYou’re giving out, About how you’re living, \n\nBut I don’t want to know\n\n\n\nDon’t say nothing’s going right for you, my dear\n\nSome day you’ll have nothing left to fear\n\nAnd time flies; you don’t have long to go\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love \n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love \n\n\n\nThe world is full of empty promises\n\nSpinning faster than before\n\nYou know they say \"You get what you give\" \n\nSo give a little more\n\n\n\nDon’t say nothing’s going right for you, my dear\n\nSome day you’ll have nothing left to fear\n\nAnd time flies; you don’t have long to go\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love \n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love \n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love \n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love \n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love\n\n\n\nDon’t say nothing’s going right for you, my dear\n\nSome day you’ll have nothing left to fear\n\nAnd time flies; you don’t have long to go\n\n\n\nDon’t say nothing’s going right for you, my dear\n\nSome day you’ll have nothing left to fear\n\nAnd time flies; you don’t have long to go\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love\n\nUntil you’ve got no more time to love"
