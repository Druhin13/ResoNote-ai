  "lyrics": "My friend the communist\r\nHolds meetings in his RV\r\nI can't afford his gas\r\nSo I'm stuck here watching TV\r\nI don't have digital\r\nI don't have diddly squat\n\nIt's not having what you want\n\nIt's wanting what you've got \n\nCHORUS:\n\nI'm gonna soak up the sun\n\nGonna tell everyone\n\nTo lighten up (I'm gonna tell 'em that)\n\nI've got no one to blame\n\nFor every time I feel lame\n\nI'm looking up I'm gonna soak up the sun\n\nI'm gonna soak up the sun\n\nI've got a crummy job\n\nIt don't pay near enough\n\nTo buy the things it takes\n\nTo win me some of your love\n\nEvery time I turn around\n\nI'm looking up, you're looking down\n\nMaybe something's wrong with you\n\nThat makes you act the way you do\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n\nI'm gonna soak up the sun\n\n\n\nWhile it's still free\n\nI'm gonna soak up the sun\n\nBefore it goes out on me\n\nDon't have no master suite\n\nI'm still the king of me\n\nYou have a fancy ride, but baby\n\nI'm the one who has the key\n\nEvery time I turn around\n\nI'm looking up, you're looking down\n\nMaybe something's wrong with you\n\nThat makes you act the way you do\n\nMaybe I am crazy too\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n\nI'm gonna soak up the sun\n\nGot my 45 on\n\nSo I can rock on"
