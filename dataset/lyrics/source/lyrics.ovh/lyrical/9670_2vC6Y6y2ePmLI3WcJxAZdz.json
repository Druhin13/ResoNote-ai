  "lyrics": "I was thinking I had your picture on my phone\r\nGot me dreamin' bout somewhere we don't know\r\nYou stole my favorite shirt\r\nAnd left my clothes in your shower stall\r\nBut that's alright, I'll be fine\n\nBaby, you look beautiful tonight\n\nI can see the fire in your eyes\n\nCome with me and see the sunrise\n\nAnd oh, I don't wanna lose you tonight\n\n\n\nI don't wanna lose you tonight\n\nI don't wanna lose you tonight\n\n\n\nYou're like a cherry bomb\n\nI picked you up and drove you home\n\nI wanna lose it all\n\nAnd we can be misunderstood\n\nSay I'm all you want\n\nI'll spend the night crash on your catch\n\nAnd sing our favorite songs\n\n\n\nBaby, you look beautiful tonight\n\nI can see the fire in your eyes\n\nCome with me and see the sunrise\n\nAnd oh, I don't wanna lose you tonight\n\n\n\nI don't wanna lose you tonight\n\nNo, I don't wanna lose you tonight"
