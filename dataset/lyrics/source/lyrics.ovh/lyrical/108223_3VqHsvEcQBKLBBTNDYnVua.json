  "lyrics": "It's not the first time\r\nThat I've had the sense that something's wrong\r\nBut I'm old enough to know\r\nThat things don't always work out like they should\r\nI know you're tryin' hard\r\nTo break it gently to me, now\n\nBut there's no easy way\n\nTo tell it like it is, so baby...\n\n\n\nI don't want to hear any more\n\nYou don't need to tell me it's over\n\nI've been here before\n\n\n\nI've seen that look before\n\nI know it well; it comes as no surprise\n\nYou've been avoiding me\n\nBut now you want to talk it over\n\nBefore you take my hand\n\nAnd tell me softly in a whisper\n\nThere's no need to explain\n\nI've read the book; I know how this all ends\n\n\n\nI don't want to hear any more\n\nYou don't need to tell me it's over\n\nI've been here before\n\n\n\nI won't ask you to stay\n\nI won't stand in your way\n\nLook me right in the eyes\n\nLet me walk away with my head high\n\n\n\nIf there's some other guy\n\nI don't need to know why\n\n\n\nBut I don't want to hear any more\n\nYou don't need to tell me it's over\n\nI've been here before\n\n\n\nI won't ask you to stay\n\nI won't stand in your way\n\nAnd I don't want to hear any more\n\nNo, no, baby\n\nI don't want to hear any more"
