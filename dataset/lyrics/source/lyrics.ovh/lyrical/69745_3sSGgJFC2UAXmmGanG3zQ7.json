  "lyrics": "Won’t you turn away from me\r\nIn case you find you disagree\r\nWith the person I’ve become since I’ve wandered on my own\r\nOh I wish I’d fall from sight\r\nFrom the focus in the light\r\nTo the place where I grew up\n\nOr somewhere else I may belong\n\n\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride\n\n\n\nThis skin cracks like autumn leaves\n\nOn the surface of my street\n\nThat I’m scared of treading on\n\nIn case I walk too far from home\n\nEducation fills my floors/flaws\n\nI’ve misread it all before\n\nThere’s no easy way to learn\n\nIf I am really in control\n\n\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride\n\n\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride\n\n\n\nEach time I figured I was strange\n\nYou looked as if you didn’t know\n\nIn spite of everything I’ve said\n\nI hoped that you would never go\n\nI couldn’t bring myself into the light\n\nI muttered \"won’t you get lost\"\n\nI’m hollow in this skin\n\nStay with me and you’ll recognise this soon enough\n\n\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nSo follow on\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nSo follow on\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nSo follow on\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nYou’ve got your race to run\n\nSo follow on\n\n\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nBecause you've recognised\n\nThat in my isolation\n\nI'm as cold as I am vain\n\n\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nBecause you've recognised\n\nThat in my isolation\n\nI'm as cold as I am vain\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nEven though I’ve asked you not to\n\nYou step a little bit closer\n\nAnd it suffocates my pride"
