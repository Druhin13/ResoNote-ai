  "lyrics": "It's been 7 hours and 15 days\r\nSince you took your love away\r\nI go out every night and I sleep all day\r\nSince you took your love away\r\nSince you've been gone, I can do whatever I want\r\nI can see whoever I choose\n\nI can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant\n\nBut nothing, I said nothing can take away these blues\n\n'Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you\n\n\n\nIt's been so lonely without you here\n\nLike a bird without a song, ahh\n\nNothing can stop these tears from falling down\n\nTell me, baby, where did I go wrong?\n\nI could put my arms around every boy I see\n\nThey only remind me of you\n\nI went to the doctor, and guess what he told me\n\nGuess what he told me\n\nHe said, \"Girl, you better try to have some fun\n\nNo matter what you do,\" but he's a fool\n\n'Cause nothing compares, nothing compares to you\n\nNothing compares, nothing compares to you\n\nNothing compares, nothing compares to you"
