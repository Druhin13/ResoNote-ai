  "lyrics": "We took a vow in summertime\r\nNow we find ourselves in late December\r\nI believe that New Year's Eve\r\nWill be the perfect time\r\nFor their great surrender\r\nBut they don't remember\n\n\n\nAnger wants a voice\n\nVoices wanna sing\n\nSingers harmonize\n\nTill they can't hear anything\n\nThought that I was free\n\nFrom all that questioning\n\nBut every time a problem ends\n\nAnother one begins\n\n\n\nAnd the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness\n\nAnybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight\n\nOf wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\n\n\n\nWithin the halls of power lies\n\nA nervous heart that beats\n\nLike a young pretender's\n\nBeneath these velvet gloves I hide\n\nThe shameful crooked ends\n\nOf money lender\n\n'Cause I still remember\n\n\n\nAnger wants a voice\n\nVoices wanna sing\n\nSingers harmonize\n\nTill they can't hear anything\n\nThought that I was free\n\nFrom all that questioning\n\nBut every time a problem ends\n\nAnother one begins\n\n\n\nAnd the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness\n\nAnybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight\n\nOf wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\n\n\n\nAnd the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness\n\nAnybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight\n\nOf wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\n\n\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\n\nAnd the stone walls of Harmony Hall bear witness\n\nAnybody with a holy mind can never forgive the sight\n\nOf wicked snakes inside a place you thought was dignified\n\nI don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die"
