  "lyrics": "I wanna go where you go\r\nBlowin' your smoke out the window, float away\r\nBack to those Tokyo nights, you keep me up wide awake\r\nWe fall asleep on the floor in old sheets and Champagne\r\nAnd I wanna fall like snowfall\r\nJust to melt on your pillow, drift away\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights, where we were so out of place\n\nWe fall asleep in my car, to songs that all sound the same\n\nI wanna go where you go\n\nBlowin' your smoke out the window, drift away\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights, you keep me up wide awake\n\nWe fall asleep in my car, to songs that all sound the same\n\nAnd it really don't matter which way we go\n\nYou got effect like domino\n\nFinally up and down we go\n\nHow we get back there, I don't know\n\nAnd it really don't matter how fast we go\n\nYou got effect like domino\n\nYou take me down\n\nDown\n\nI wanna go\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights, Tokyo nights\n\nI feel it\n\nI wanna fall like we fell\n\nFor the first time in the hotel, miss the way\n\nWe fell asleep in our clothes, but you were to shy to stay\n\nWalking you home it still feels like it was just yesterday\n\nAnd it really don't matter which way we go\n\nYou got effect like domino\n\nFinally up and down we go\n\nHow we get back there, I don't know\n\nAnd it really don't matter how fast we go\n\nYou got effect like domino\n\nYou take me down\n\nDown\n\nI wanna go\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights, Tokyo nights\n\nI feel it\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights, Tokyo nights\n\nI feel it\n\nI wanna go where you go\n\nBlowing your smoke out the window\n\nDrift away\n\nAnd I wanna fall like snow fall\n\nJust to melt on your pillow, drift away\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights\n\nWhere we were so out of place\n\nWe fall asleep in my car to songs that all sound the same\n\nI wanna go\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights, Tokyo nights\n\nI feel it\n\nBack to those Tokyo nights"
