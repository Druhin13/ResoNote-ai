  "lyrics": "Shoot the messenger, string 'em up\r\nShe’s a 10 plus 10 - not enough\r\nMixed messages, wires crossed\r\nMarry me, what you got? Too much\r\nTooth brush and socks\r\nParents minted, Mayfair, couple dogs\n\nWe go on walks, she never talks\n\nI pour my heart out and she laps up my blood\n\nBlue lights, double vision\n\nHeart races like super cars\n\nTwo drinks, the rooms spinning\n\nZebedee, you’re the ace of hearts\n\nHigh society, cute kittens\n\nAllergies, I don’t like you enough\n\nBlocked me on your private finsta\n\nYour godmother should come play with us\n\n\n\nNicotine - can’t quit it\n\nTwo's up, two's down\n\nYou stub it out before I finish\n\nOn my arm and I scream out “wow!”\n\nNicotine - can’t quit it\n\nTwo's up, two's down\n\nYou stub it out before I finish\n\nOn my arm and I scream out “wow!”\n\n\n\nDoorman, let me in the door\n\nSpent all my money, you ain't getting no more wages\n\nSure Sir, Sir, are you sure?\n\nIn short - I’m not a mop you can drag 'cross the floor\n\nInside, shell shock\n\nShe's standing with a guy\n\nGuys your mans stare him out\n\nReal polite, \"No, please, no thanks\"\n\n\"Want a drink?\", \"I’m alright\"\n\nBeer goggles on, pull the wool, now I’m blind\n\nClear as day, I can see\n\nYou make me melt - sun, ice cream\n\nYou smooth like felt, soft to the touch\n\nYou were repellent, smell your scent from up above\n\nAngel getting carried out the club\n\nFor slapping Harry, Harry’s just a mug\n\nI’m stood outside waiting, where you gone?\n\nCubicle lines, catch a cold - Jack Frost\n\n\n\nNicotine - can’t quit it\n\nTwo's up, two's down\n\nYou stub it out before I finish\n\nOn my arm and I scream out “wow!”\n\nNicotine - can’t quit it\n\nTwo's up, two's down\n\nYou stub it out before I finish\n\nOn my arm and I scream out “wow!”"
