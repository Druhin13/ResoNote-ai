  "lyrics": "All my everything is for you\r\nAll my terrible sense of humor and critical interviews\r\nAll my pearly gated redemption and casual afternoons\r\nAll this money you know I'm making\r\nLike racin' against the moon, but\r\nI sell pain for profit, and I feel prophet watchin'\n\nEverything is for everything, rhymin' with causality\n\nAin't no labels that's backing me, but my tickets be sellin' out\n\nAnd I'm steady raising my fee, that's another hit from my fee\n\n110 degrees in the desert heat\n\nWith a bubble coat, turtleneck underneath\n\nRolling up on the beach\n\nSmokin a holy weed, laughing, baking\n\nMy homie Tee hopin' joking is all we need\n\nWhen I sell pain for profit\n\nNow I binge watch Atlanta\n\nNo more TV representation from a Kelsey Grammer\n\nLet's toast to niggas getting checks who work behind the camera\n\nSomebody raise they man up\n\n\n\nTruth be told, I wear my heart on my sleeve\n\nWatch you sit it on the shelf\n\nNow my body got cold\n\nI swear we'll never leave\n\nHad to do it for myself, to find my praise\n\nGo get your weapon\n\n\n\nReal recognize real, feelin' like real proof\n\nReal buddy-buddy after the trip to the Cancun\n\nMillion dollar baby, bet you can get to the hands, too\n\nGot a pack of wolves ready to damage a full moon\n\nThe only bitch actually rapping, it look like me now\n\nOr meow, kitty just reimagined a freestyle\n\nDM flooded, niggas still waitin' for me to reach out\n\nWe shadow boxing government hopin' they put the leash down\n\nI sell pain for profit not propaganda\n\nI know cancers origins link to Santa\n\nI know Santa's origins link to money\n\nMass production of cattle, a slaughtering for the yummy\n\nThese niggas is clever, the prison no better\n\nThe ghost of the living\n\nWe ain't talkin' about Reggie on Christmas, we almost forget him\n\nWhat's a casket to a holding cell if a nigga ain't in it\n\nOnly reason why I'm steady faded and still independent\n\n\n\nTruth be told, I wear my heart on my sleeve\n\nWatch you sit it on the shelf\n\nNow my body got cold\n\nI swear we'll never leave\n\nHad to do it for myself, to find my praise\n\nGo get your weapon"
