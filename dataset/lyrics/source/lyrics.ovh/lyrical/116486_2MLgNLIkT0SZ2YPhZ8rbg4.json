X 4\r\nThis is rollercoaster love\r\nCan you take me high?\r\nThis is rollercoaster love\r\nLeave you breathless every time\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nCan you take me high?\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nLeave you breathless every time\n\n\n\nYou gon' hate me til you love me again\n\nYou gon' hate me til I’m at your doorstep\n\nHate me til I’m getting undressed\n\nLove me when you hear that door lock\n\nHate me til I whisper don’t stop\n\nHate me til I’m coasting on top\n\nHate me til I’m coming down slow\n\nLove me when I say I want more\n\n\n\nAnd I’m topsy turvy gliding round these curves, we\n\nBumping grinding flying pining, no tree\n\n\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nCan you take me high?\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nLeave you breathless every time\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nCan you take me high?\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nLeave you breathless every time\n\n\n\nIt’s seven o’clock on the dot\n\nI hear the knock knock\n\nWho could it be?\n\n‘Cause we fuss and we fight\n\nBut you can’t get enough of me, yeah\n\nYou got plans, to put your hands\n\nExactly where they need to be\n\nAnd baby that’s here with me\n\nSo every time I take you low\n\nImagine how high we’re bound to go\n\n\n\nAnd I’m topsy turvy gliding round these curves, we\n\nBumping grinding flying pining, no tree\n\n\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nCan you take me high?\n\nThis is rollercoaster love\n\nI could leave you breathless every time"
