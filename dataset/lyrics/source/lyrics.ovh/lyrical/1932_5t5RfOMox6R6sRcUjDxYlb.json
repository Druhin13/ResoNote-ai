  "lyrics": "While walking out, one evening,\r\nNot knowing where to go\r\nJust to pass the time away\r\nBefore we held our show\r\nI heard a little mission band\r\nPlaying with all their might\n\nI gave my soul to Jesus\n\nAnd left the show that night\n\nThe day will soon be over\n\nAnd evening will be done\n\nNo more gems to be gathered\n\nSo let us all press on\n\nWhen Jesus comes to claim us\n\nAnd says it is enough\n\nThe diamonds will be shining\n\nNo longer in the rough"
