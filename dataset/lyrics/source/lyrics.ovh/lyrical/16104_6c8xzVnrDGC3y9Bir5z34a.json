  "lyrics": "I dunno I can’t remember your name\r\nWell I’m sorry everyone looks the same\r\nI have a problem and it’s breaking my heart\r\nYou gotta help me I don’t know where to start\r\nI try to speak I can’t say nothing\n\nI had a dream it was really something\n\nBut now I’m up, I can’t recall what it was\n\n\n\nWell, have you been around here for a while?\n\nWho'd you have to rob to get that style?\n\nDon’t get angry, don’t act so surprised\n\nYour fate is showing, I can see it in your eyes\n\n\n\nSo tell me what I’ve got to do to\n\nTo let me t-t-touch you\n\nYou say you’re lost but I don’t believe that’s true, no\n\n\n\nYou’re at home, baby\n\nCash for gold, baby\n\nYou got that diamond handed soul, baby\n\nOn me, no control\n\n\n\nOh my my, my love\n\nI know you’re wise to all those trials and games\n\nThey'll crack fools of slobber and they drool and try to convince you it’s rain\n\n\n\nWell you know some people got no class\n\nThere’s also one more to try to make a pass\n\nI can’t dance, I just stand by the wall\n\nWho am I say anything at all?\n\n\n\nWell, but if I had it my way\n\nI’d leave my body, fly away\n\nOff to another world\n\nMaybe someday I’ll try\n\n\n\nAnd I’ll be at home, baby\n\nCash for gold, baby\n\nGot those quicksilver holes, you can swallow me whole"
