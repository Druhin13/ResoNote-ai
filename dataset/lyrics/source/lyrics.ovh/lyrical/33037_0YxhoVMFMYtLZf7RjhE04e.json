  "lyrics": "Stay beside the storm that linger in the clouds\r\nStarve inside of me, there's no way out\r\nLike I for anything that burns me down\r\nThe more and more I try\r\nI crave\n\nI need\n\nIt kills\n\nI can't break my heart\n\n\n\nI cry so long\n\nIt kills\n\nI can't break my heart\n\n\n\nLive within the walls that filter out the sound\n\nI take the best of me, then turn around\n\nI aim for enemy that tears me down\n\nThe more and more I try\n\n\n\nI crave\n\nI need\n\nIt kills\n\nI can't break my heart\n\n\n\nI cry so long\n\nIt kills\n\nI can't break my heart"
