  "lyrics": "Saw my shrink today, he said girl I can't help you\r\nI've been seeing you so long, but nothing has changed\r\nYou tried Adderall and alcohol, sadly the fact remains\r\nYou're Terminally normal, I'm sorry to say\r\nSo I shaved my head, I changed my name\r\nAnd I gave my pills away\n\n\n\nCause If I can't be someone else\n\nIf I can't be someone else\n\nI might as well be myself, myself\n\nBe myself\n\n\n\nHanging with the hipsters is a lot of hard work\n\nHow many selfies can you take before you look like a jerk?\n\nI took an Uber to a juice bar to hear a new indie band play\n\nThey got 99 million followers in only one day\n\nWell, I snapped thst pic and I made the slip\n\nI got into a stranger's car\n\nWell, the heels don't fit, I finally quit\n\nAnd headed back to my favorite bar\n\n\n\nCause if I can't be someone else\n\nIf I can't be someone else\n\nOh if I can't be someone else\n\nI might as well be myself, myself\n\n\n\nDon't you wanna be your own girl?\n\nDon't you wanna be your own girl?\n\nDon't you wanna be your own girl?\n\nOh oh\n\n\n\nIf I can't be someone else\n\nIf I can't be someone else\n\nOh if I can't be someone else\n\n\n\nIf I can't be someone else\n\nIf I can't be someone else\n\nOh if I can't be someone else\n\nI might as well, might as well be myself\n\nBe myself\n\nOh if I can't be someone else\n\nI might as well be myself, myself\n\nBe myself\n\nGonna be myself"
