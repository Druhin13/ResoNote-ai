  "lyrics": "If I had you at my mercy\r\nThere's no telling what I'd do\r\nBut I'd sit and make you listen\r\nFor an hour, maybe two\r\nAnd then you'd know I need you\r\nEvery day that rolls around\n\nAnd your feet would walk on velvet\n\nWith gold all over the ground\n\n\n\nAll your trails would be downhill\n\nA soft breeze at your back\n\nA sky full of diamonds\n\nAnd your nights would not be black\n\nYes, you would really love it\n\nAnd if you're ever down\n\nI'd give you rows of roses\n\nAnd gold all over the ground\n\n\n\nI'd pick you up and carry you 'cross every stream I see\n\nAnd I'd bundle you in kindness\n\nUntil you cling to me\n\nWe'd sit beneath strong branches\n\nMy arms would twine around\n\nI'd turn your green to emerald\n\nAnd give you gold all over the ground\n\n\n\nI'd pick you up and carry you 'cross every stream I see\n\nAnd I'd bundle you in kindness\n\nUntil you cling to me\n\nWe'd sit beneath strong branches\n\nMy arms would twine around\n\nI'd turn your green to emerald\n\nAnd your skies full diamonds\n\nAnd give you gold all over the ground"
