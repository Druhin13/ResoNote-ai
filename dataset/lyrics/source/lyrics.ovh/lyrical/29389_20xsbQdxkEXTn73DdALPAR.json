  "lyrics": "D Bm A\nTough Mama, meat shaking on your bones\nD Bm A\nI'm gonna take you down to the river and get you stoned.\nBm A\nPapa's on the highway with that steel driving crew\n\nBm F#m Em G\n\nSister's in the big house her working days are through\n\nSee G A\n\nTough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?\n\n\n\nDark Beauty, Won't you move it on over and make some room?\n\nIt's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.\n\nAshes in the furnace, dust on the rise,\n\nYou came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.\n\nDark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes.\n\n\n\nSweet Goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,\n\nNow, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.\n\nJack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past.\n\nThe Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast.\n\nSweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.\n\n\n\nSilver Angel, with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,\n\nI'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive. Today on the\n\nCountryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge\n\nAnd all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another\n\nNotch.\n\n\n\nI'm crestfallen, the world of illusion is at my door,\n\nI ain't haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.\n\nThe prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,\n\nI've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.\n\nDark Beauty Meet me at the border late tonight."
