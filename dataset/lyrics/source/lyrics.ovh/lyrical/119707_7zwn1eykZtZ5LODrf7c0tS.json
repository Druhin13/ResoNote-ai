  "lyrics": "Hope you don't regret it\r\nI pushed a lot back, but I can't forget it\r\nWe never got the credit\r\nNobody seemed to hear us, but we said it\r\nNeither of us planned it\r\nAnd for a long time I took it all for granted\n\nI really thought we had it\n\nBut at the time it was more than I could manage\n\n\n\nSo, if we can leave it all behind us\n\nAnd meet in between\n\nIt would get me so\n\n\n\nHigh all the time, high all the time\n\nI wanna be high all the time\n\nWould you come with me\n\n\n\nWish I didn't doubt it\n\nI wish I never ever told you all about it\n\nBut I just had to let you know\n\nI never meant to hurt you though\n\nI had all my motives\n\nI didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions\n\nI just had to reach my goals\n\nNever knew I need you though, so\n\n\n\nIf we can agree to disagree, yeah\n\nKeep on reaching\n\nIt would get you so\n\n\n\nHigh all the time, high all the time\n\nI wanna be high all the time\n\nWould you come with me\n\nHigh all the time, high all the time\n\nI wanna be high all the time\n\nWould you come with me\n\n\n\nUsed to stick together\n\n\"You're my best friend, I'll love you forever\n\nWe could be the greatest\n\nIt doesn't matter if we're never rich or famous\"\n\n\n\nHigh all the time, high all the time\n\nI wanna be high all the time\n\nWould you come with me\n\n\n\nIf you can just let me know if it's okay\n\nTo call you when I'm lonely"
