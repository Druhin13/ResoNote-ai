  "lyrics": "Breathe, release\r\nDon't be ashamed to let me bear some of your weight\r\nOr you can lock it in your head\r\nLet it build up till your eyes are turning red\r\nAnd you think I can't tell\n\nYou're settling again into your own hell\n\n\n\nI can't make them go away\n\nAll the little things that you just can't let go\n\nAnd I can't ease your pain\n\nUnless you tell me what it is that your heart can't fathom\n\nI'm not sure what to say\n\nAnd I'm spitting out the words that I wish I'd swallow\n\nBut I'm still here to stay\n\nSo tell me what it is that you just can't let go\n\n\n\nBreathe, relive\n\nJust let it bottle â€˜til the pressure caves you in\n\n\n\nOr you can tear down all the walls that you built around you\n\nLet the pain subside cause you know that I see\n\nYou're settling again into your own hell\n\n\n\nI can't make them go away\n\nAll the little things that you just can't let go\n\nAnd I can't ease your pain\n\nUnless you tell me what it is that your heart can't fathom\n\nI'm not sure what to say\n\nAnd I'm spitting out the words that I wish I'd swallow\n\nBut I'm still here to stay\n\nSo tell me what it is that you just can't let go\n\n\n\nI can't make them go away\n\nAll the little things that you just can't let go\n\nAnd I can't ease your pain\n\nUnless you tell me what it is that your heart can't fathom\n\nI'm not sure what to say\n\nAnd I'm spitting out the words that I wish I'd swallow\n\nBut I'm still here to stay\n\nSo tell me what it is that you just can't let go"
