  "lyrics": "Hello honey\r\nIt's been a long few years\r\nHow'm I doin'?\r\nI'm just counting all my tears\r\nYou look so happy\r\nAfter all I've put you through\n\nIt's nice to see you after so long\n\nHow's the world been treating you?\n\n\n\nYes I noticed that ring there on your hand\n\nOh what's his name? Any children? It's okay, I understand\n\nI don't expect you to forgive me\n\nBut movin' on's my greatest fear\n\nUntil then, until I'm ready\n\nI'll just be counting all my tears\n\n\n\nThe first one's for the mem'ry of the greatest love I've known\n\nAnd by the time you reach the second, there's a million more to go\n\nEach drop contains a mem'ry of a time when you were here\n\nNow I spend my sleepless nights alone just counting all my tears\n\nNow I spend my sleepless nights alone just counting all my tears"
