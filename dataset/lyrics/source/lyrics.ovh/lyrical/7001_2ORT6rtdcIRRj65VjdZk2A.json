  "lyrics": "I can’t turn the lights out darling.\nI can’t close the door.\nI can’t say forever\ncause I’ll love you evermore.\nYou changed me.\nYou changed me.\n\n\n\nYou held my hand at night.\n\nWe crumbled\n\n- the tears were black and gold.\n\nThe eyes of fallen lovers whispered:\n\n“Never evermore”.\n\nYou changed me.\n\nYou changed me.\n\n\n\nYour body’s calm and fear beside me.\n\nThe feeling of defeat inside me.\n\nThe dream within the nightmare coming through.\n\nTo uncreate the uncreated.\n\nDismissing the disintegrated.\n\nOur gravity – the fear letting go."
