  "lyrics": "Here's to the daddies who drive 'em big old trucks\r\nDoing what they've gotta do to fill their babies' bellies up\r\nAnd here's to the mamas who hold the fork down while they're gone\r\nMaking those miles all worthwhile\r\nWhen they get back home\n\nAnd here's to the teachers who are up at the crack of dawn\n\nLearning our little ones to read and write\n\nShowing them right from wrong\n\nAnd here's to the doctors who save the little boys and girls\n\nWho you never know, might one day grow up to save the world\n\n\n\nAnd here's to the oneS who ain't in here tonight\n\nTelling jokes and blowing smoke and soaking up that neon light\n\nThey're fighting fires, fighting crime, fighting for our lives\n\nLord knows they'd rather be right here\n\nSo here's to all the ones out there somewhere\n\nNeeding a beer\n\n\n\nHere's to the farmer who was gonna come out tonight\n\nBut there's hay on the ground and it's gonna pour down\n\nAnd he's running outta light\n\nAnd here's to the banker who gave him a few more weeks\n\n'Cause he knows a man who knows that hard\n\nCan't lose no more sleep\n\n\n\nAnd here's to the ones who ain't in here tonight\n\nTelling jokes and blowing smoke and soaking up that neon light\n\nThey're fighting fires, fighting crime, fighting for our lives\n\nLord knows they'd rather be right here\n\nSo here's to all the ones out there somewhere\n\nNeeding a beer\n\n\n\nTo all you unsung heroes\n\nWe owe you a round\n\nI'll buy one for you next time\n\nAnd I'll drink one for you now\n\n\n\nHere's to the one swho ain't in here tonight\n\nTelling jokes and blowing smoke and soaking up that neon light\n\nThey're fighting fires, fighting crime, fighting for our lives\n\nLord knows they'd rather be right here\n\nSo here's to all the ones out there somewhere\n\nNeeding a beer"
