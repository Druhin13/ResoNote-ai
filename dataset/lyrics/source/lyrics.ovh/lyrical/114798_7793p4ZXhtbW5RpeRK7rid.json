  "lyrics": "We burn and we played, we try to forget\r\nBut the memories left are still haunting\r\nThe walls that we built from bottles and pills\r\nWe swallow until we're not talking\r\nI... I am a man on fire\n\nYou... a violent desire\n\n\n\nWhat a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove\n\nDon't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (oh, oh)\n\n\n\nDo you wanna cross the line?\n\nWe're runnin' out of time\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove\n\n\n\nStarted a stranger, a love endangered\n\nThe edge of a night\n\nThe face of an angel, the heart of a ghost\n\nWas it a dream?\n\n\n\nI... I am a man on fire\n\nYou... a violent desire\n\n\n\nWhat a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove\n\nDon't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (oh, oh)\n\n\n\nDo you wanna cross the line?\n\nWe're runnin' out of time\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh)\n\n\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\nI... I am a man on fire\n\nFire, fire, fire, fire\n\nYou... a violent desire\n\n\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove\n\n\n\nDo you wanna cross the line?\n\nWe're runnin' out of time\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nA dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)"
