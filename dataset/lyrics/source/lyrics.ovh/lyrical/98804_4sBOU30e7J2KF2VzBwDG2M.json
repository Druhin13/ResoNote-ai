  "lyrics": "Let me tell you the saddest story\r\nLove lost left broken and empty\r\nPut my heart in the hands of another\r\nSet a fire to the past and watch me burn\r\nSomehow I guess it's better this way\n\nLooking back was it all just a mistake?\n\nThought I could live in the arms of another\n\nBut I guess I wasn't enough for her\n\n\n\nI wanna feel the love you can't live without\n\nThe one that Johnny Cash wrote all his songs about\n\nBut I gave it all away for no return\n\nGuess it's just another lesson that I'll never learn\n\n\n\nI've been putting myself through your Hell\n\nHolding on to things that don't even matter now\n\nYou found your place in the arms of another\n\nBut now I see it's just the way the Earth will turn\n\n\n\nI wanna feel the love you can't live without\n\nThe one that Johnny Cash wrote all his songs about\n\nBut I gave it all away for no return\n\nGuess it's just another lesson that I'll never learn\n\n\n\nCan't seem to fill the void that lives in my chest\n\nThought I was what you need but I'm just second best\n\nI'll never give it all away again I swear\n\nDon't even look for a heart you'll find there's nothing there\n\n\n\n(I can't take it back)\n\nAll the years that we spent together have come to an end\n\n(Regret is all I had)\n\nNot sure I would if I could do it all over again\n\n(I can't take it back)\n\nThe memories, the pictures, I love you's will wither\n\n(Regret is all I had)\n\nBut this is the last song I'll write about you\n\n\n\nForget my name\n\nForget my face\n\nIt was all just empty space\n\nDeadweight; no longer part of me"
