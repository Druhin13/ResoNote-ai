Wait!)\n\nAll this \"Purple Rain\" got me thinking of her\n\nBut she never satisfy like Prince's mother\n\nOkay I'm tripping thats the psychedelics\n\nImagine walking on the moon and letting Micheal tell it\n\nSee they don't really care about us\n\nAnd they spiteful jealous\n\nTell me why the days depress us, but the nights compels us\n\nThought I was gone, they was wrong, they assume (Assume)\n\nI guess somebody got me exhumed, you fucking doomed\n\nYou silver spoon goons since they let you out the womb\n\nI rose from the tomb turned coffin to cocoon\n\nThe tension so thick in the room\n\nRevenge code got you feeling like its Christmas in June\n\nAnd it's sweet, reverse the roles, you be licking the spoon\n\nBut you occupied with all that fucking dick you consume\n\nThe flow is sassafras I had to razzamatazz the risk\n\nImmigrant, I'm what happens if Aladdin had some bricks\n\nJasmine had a pimp\n\nRide a magic carpet with the tints\n\nDiamonds in the rough\n\nOver pressure that I underwent\n\nIn the lab again, I'm back to lapping rappers in this labyrinth\n\nI'm snapping back like Bobby Backlund\n\nMe coming back is not an accident (It's not)\n\nSee I don't ever gotta rap again\n\nNumb to it, I'm getting money just to run through it\n\nI don't even gotta thumb through it if it come too it\n\nShe hear the money and she come to it\n\nI don't eat the pussy I just hum to it (Hum to it)"
