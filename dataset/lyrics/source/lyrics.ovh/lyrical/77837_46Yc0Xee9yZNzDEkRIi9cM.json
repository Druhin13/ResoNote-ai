  "lyrics": "Riding waves of sound\r\n300 mile from Metropolitan\r\nGrapes of wrath all around\r\nRiding waves of sound\r\nBreath on lines everyone's story\n\nFind a spot until the names are called\n\nTimes will pull in all directions\n\nBe the barker for the traveling show\n\n\n\n15 times from the edge of eternity\n\nNerves that shake have been chased away\n\nThere is a girl that I want to see\n\nOn each side of that marching drum\n\n\n\nRiding waves of sound\n\n300 mile from Metropolitan\n\nGrapes of wrath all around\n\nRiding waves of sound\n\n\n\nBreak up the old drug pound story\n\nTortured soul wears an ego sleeve\n\nHeavy hearts and heavy hitters\n\nBards disease finds the killing floor\n\n\n\nStraight from her two lanes of freedom\n\nUnconquered souls delivered each day\n\nGasoline junkies feral diesel fiends\n\nLooking for action on the mercy wide road"
