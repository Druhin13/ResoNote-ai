You know that's my shit\n\nEvery time we together, we're on some fly shit\n\nI'm gon' chase the weather, when I'm inside it\n\nLooking at you now, baby you a show-off\n\nDon't you slow down, baby girl go off\n\nLet your hair down, let me take a load off\n\nAnd your body's so soft, do it till we doze off\n\n\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nAnybody that calls, they get you tomorrow\n\nDon't pick it up\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nKnow you're safe in my arms, give a fuck what they want\n\nDon't pick it up\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nLeave your clothes at the door\n\nKiss your body before you give this love\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nAnd I won't disappoint, let's get straight to the point\n\n\n\nKnow you had a long day, you deserve a long break\n\nYou can have it all day, fuck with you the long way\n\nYou deserve a good time, you deserve a long night\n\nSo many things on your mind, let me make it alright\n\nLooking at you now, baby you a show-off\n\nDon't you slow down, baby girl go off\n\nLet your hair down, let me take a load off\n\nAnd your body's so soft, do it till we doze off\n\n\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nAnybody that calls, they get you tomorrow\n\nDon't pick it up\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nKnow you're safe in my arms, give a fuck what they want\n\nDon't pick it up\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nLeave your clothes at the door\n\nKiss your body before you give this love\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nAnd I won't disappoint, let's get straight to the point\n\n\n\nLook baby I know you got a lot of things going on right know\n\nJust lay it down\n\nGet that stress of your mind, make you feel good in the meantime\n\nLay yo head down, lay yo head down\n\nLeave your clothes at the door\n\nKiss your body before you give this love\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down\n\nLay your head down, lay your head down"
