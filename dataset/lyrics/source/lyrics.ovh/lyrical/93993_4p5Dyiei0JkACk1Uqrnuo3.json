  "lyrics": "Oh the mud splattered victims\r\nHave to pay out all along the ancient highway\r\nTorn between half truth and victimisation\r\nFighting back with counter attacks\r\nIt's when that rough god goes riding\n\nWhen the rough god goes gliding\n\nAnd then rough god goes riding\n\nRiding on in\n\n\n\nI was flabbergasted by the headlines\n\nPeople in glasshouses throwing stones\n\nGaping wounds that will never heal\n\nNow they're moaning like a dog in a manger\n\n\n\nIt's when that rough god goes riding\n\nAnd then the rough god goes gliding\n\nThere'll be nobody hiding\n\nWhen that rough god comes riding on in\n\n\n\nAnd it's a matter of survival\n\nWhen you're born with your back against the wall\n\nWon't somebody hand me a bible\n\nWon't you give me that number to call\n\n\n\nWhen that rough god goed riding\n\nAnd then that rough god goes gliding\n\nThey'll be nobody hiding\n\nWhen that rough god goes riding on in\n\nRiding on in\n\n\n\nWhen that rough god goed riding\n\nWhen that rough god goes gliding\n\nThere'll be nobody hiding\n\nWhen that rough god goes riding on in\n\nRiding on in\n\n\n\nThere'll be no more heroes\n\nThey'll be reduced to zero\n\nWhen that rough god goes riding\n\nRiding on in\n\nRiding on in\n\nRiding on in\n\nRiding on in"
