  "lyrics": "I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans\r\nI got a certain lust for life and as it stands\r\nEverything is going as right as it can\r\nThey tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands\r\nBut you could miss me with all that\r\nDiss me, then crawl back\n\nI really wish y'all would fall back\n\nBut gettin rich s'posed to solve that\n\nAnd these days, women make offers\n\nAnd who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?\n\nMy ex sendin' late night texts\n\n'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)\n\nUh, she in love\n\nAnd as for them pretty light-skinned models\n\nStandin in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us\n\nLet them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear\n\nSaying she should be the one I see every time that I'm here\n\nBut when am I really even here?\n\nBlack Surburban with the tint on it\n\nFresher than a pillow with a mint on it\n\nThe game got these old handprints on it\n\nBut I'mma be the one to pour cement on it\n\nUh, and start over\n\nAnd show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck\n\nAnd we only gettin older\n\nSo what I tend to do is to think of today as the past\n\nIt's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last\n\nYou just hope that it last\n\n\n\nThrow your ones up in the air\n\nThrow your ones up in the air for her, oh-oh\n\nThrow your ones up in the air\n\nThrow your ones up"
