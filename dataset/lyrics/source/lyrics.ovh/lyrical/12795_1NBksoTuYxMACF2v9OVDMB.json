  "lyrics": "Free as my footsteps, my footsteps on the ground\r\nCertain of intention but not where they are bound\r\nFinding my footing as I fall\r\nA little too late maybe baby, but that's the fun of it all\r\n'Cause fish have fins\r\nBirds have wings\n\nI was given these two things\n\nTo run the world\n\nAnd chase my dreams\n\nIn my bare feet\n\nI'm in my bare feet\n\n'Cause I want to feel the world's heart beat\n\nI want to grow tall and strong like a tree\n\nTouch the sky with my roots so deep\n\nNo agenda to my free, no insecurity I'm trying to feed\n\nI just want to feel the world's heartbeat, beat, beat\n\nUnderneath my bare feet\n\nDon't keep the cares that keep you from your peace\n\nSurefooted and lighthearted, just the way you're supposed to be\n\nYou ain't never been a fragile soul and you won't start now\n\nWhat a shame it'd be to waste your moments on doubt\n\n'Cause fish have fins and birds have wings\n\nWe are given these two things\n\nTo run the world\n\nAnd chase our dreams\n\nIn our bare feet\n\nI'm in my bare feet\n\n'Cause I want to feel the world's heart beat\n\nI want to grow tall and strong like a tree\n\nTouch the sky with my roots so deep\n\nNo agenda to my free, no insecurity I'm trying to feed\n\nI just want to feel the world's heartbeat, beat, beat\n\nUnderneath my bare feet\n\nUnderneath my bare feet\n\nWe have more freedom than we realize\n\nMore choices than we exercise\n\nFind me under those blue skies\n\nIn my bare feet\n\nI just want to feel the world's heartbeat\n\nIn my bare feet, 'cause I want to feel the world's heartbeat\n\nI want to grow tall and strong like a tree\n\nTouch the sky with my roots so deep\n\nNo agenda to my free, no one else that I'm trying to be\n\nI just want to feel the world's heartbeat, beat, beat\n\nUnderneath my bare feet"
