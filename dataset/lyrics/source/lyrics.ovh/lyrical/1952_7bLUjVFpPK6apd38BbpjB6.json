  "lyrics": "I'm beginning to like you\r\nBut, you know that ain't right\r\n'Cause you'll just twist and twist and twist\r\nTill I'm all crooked inside\r\nThen you'll take all you gave me\n\nLike it never was there\n\nAnd I think that I might, No! I know\n\nYes, I will help you there\n\n'Cause ...\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nI've done it before\n\nAnd I'd do it again\n\n'Cause it's the only time\n\nThat makes me feel like I'm\n\nMy own best friend\n\n\n\nI'm a victim of friction I just got too close to see\n\nYeah, we sparked in the dark and God hung a light on me\n\nAnd the lamp gets real heavy and it hangs from my heart\n\nAnd it comes, and it goes\n\nTill I can't tell the difference apart\n\nBut ...\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\n\n\nSo many people say\n\nIt'll never work out that way\n\nYou can't stand the heat\n\nWhile you're watching your heart\n\nJust melt away in the basement\n\nOn a rainy day\n\nLa la la\n\nLa la la\n\nLa lala\n\nLalala la lalaaaaaaaaaa ...\n\n\n\nThere's motel in Shreveport\n\nDon't ask me where, please\n\nThey check in, they check out\n\nBy the light of the color TV's\n\nAnd the maid calls you honey\n\nAnd she makes your bed slow\n\nAnd she speaks, of the sheets that don't fit\n\nBut you know that she knows\n\nThat ...\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus"
