Did I inherit this?\n\nAm I a hypocrite to say that I ain't feelin' this (No, no, no, no, no!)\n\n'Cause I ain't feelin' this (No, no, no, no, no, no, no!)\n\n\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nWhere can you go?\n\nWhen your momma is a burnout\n\nAnd your daddy is a pyro\n\n\n\n'Cause they just want to light it on fire\n\nAnd they just want to let it all burn\n\nAnd they just want to light it on fire\n\nAnd they just want to let it all burn\n\n\n\nSet fire to the family tree\n\nSet fire to the family tree\n\n\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nWhere can you go?\n\nWhen your momma is a burnout\n\nAnd your daddy is a pyro\n\n\n\n'Cause they just want to light it on fire\n\nAnd they just want to let it all burn\n\nAnd they just want to light it on fire\n\nAnd they just want to let it all burn\n\n\n\nSet fire to the family tree\n\nSet fire to the family tree\n\nSet fire to the family tree\n\nSet fire to the family tree"
