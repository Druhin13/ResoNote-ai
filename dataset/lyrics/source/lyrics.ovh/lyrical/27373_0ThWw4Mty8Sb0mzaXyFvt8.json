  "lyrics": "You got secrets to unfold\r\nYou got stories never told\r\nYou’re holding information\r\nStanding right in front of me\r\nA hidden rhapsody\n\nI walk into temptation\n\n\n\nSomething tells me we can make some music\n\nThe rhythm is drivin’ me wild\n\nAnd something tells me we ain’t gonna loose it\n\nKeep pushin’ way into the night\n\n\n\nNumber one, keep rollin’\n\nSay you’re real, I’m hopin’\n\nDo you feel the way I do\n\n\n\nBring it on, it’s magic\n\nAre you real, fantastic\n\nSay you feel the way I do\n\n\n\nNumber two, keep turnin’\n\nFeel the heat, we’re burnin’\n\nI’ll do anything for you\n\n\n\nWe can be forever\n\nNumber one, together\n\nWe can make a dream come true\n\n\n\nWell I guess it’s up to you\n\nDo you feel the way I do\n\nWhen bodytalk is magic\n\n\n\nSo is this my lucky day\n\nWill you stay or walk away\n\nRight now you’re stoppin’ traffic\n\n\n\nSomething tells me we can make some music\n\nThe rhythm is drivin’ me wild\n\nAnd something tells me we ain’t gonna loose it\n\nKeep pushin’ way into the night\n\n\n\nNumber one, keep rollin’\n\nSay you’re real, I’m hopin’\n\nDo you feel the way I do\n\n\n\nBring it on, it’s magic\n\nAre you real, fantastic\n\nSay you feel the way I do\n\n\n\nNumber two, keep turnin’\n\nFeel the heat, we’re burnin’\n\nI’ll do anything for you\n\n\n\nWe can be forever\n\nNumber one, together\n\nWe can make a dream come true"
