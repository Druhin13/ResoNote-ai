  "lyrics": "She said Andy you're better than your past, \n?winked at me and drained her glass, \n?cross-legged on the barstool, like nobody sits anymore. \n?She said Andy you're taking me home, \n?but I knew she planned to sleep alone. \n?I'd carry her to bed and sweep up the hair from the floor \n\n\n\n??If I hadd fucked her before she got sick \n\n?I'd never hear the end of it \n\n?she don't have the spirit for that now \n\n\n\n??We drink these drinks and laugh out loud, \n\n?bitch about the weekend crowd, \n\n?and try to ignore the elephant somehow \n\n?somehow \n\n\n\n??She said Andy you crack me up, \n\n?Seagrams in a coffee cup, \n\n?sharecropper eyes and her hair almost all gone. \n\n?When she was drunk she made cancer jokes, \n\n?she made up her own doctor's notes, \n\n?surrounded by her family, I saw that she was dying alone. ?\n\n\n\n?I'd sing her classic country songs \n\n?and she'd get high and sing along. \n\n?She don't have much voice to sing with now \n\n\n\n??We'd burn these joints in effegy, \n\n?cry about what we used to be, \n\n?and try to ignore the elephant somehow. \n\n\n\n?Somehow ?\n\n\n\n?I buried her a thousand times, \n\n?giving up my place in line, \n\n?but I don't give a damn about that now \n\n\n\n??There's one thing that's real clear to me, \n\n?no one dies with dignity. \n\n?We just try to ignore the elephant somehow. \n\n?We just try to ignore the elephant somehow. \n\n?We just try to ignore the elephant somehow. \n\n?Somehow. \n\n?Somehow."
