  "lyrics": "It's a late Friday night\r\nThe street lamps are shining\r\nUp in my bedroom\r\nThere's a mighty big fight\r\nBetween the thunder and lightning\r\nWonder who you will lose\n\n\n\nI see a party balloon\n\nAnd I ain't been invited\n\nHey, look that moon\n\nThere ain't nothing like it\n\n\n\nAll grey and gold\n\nDown on Jubilee Road\n\n\n\nCan see Mr. Bouvier\n\nIn his two-bedroom basement\n\nIn his purple dungarees\n\nHe's grumpy and he's grey\n\nAlways sweeping off the pavement\n\nCigarettes and leaves\n\n\n\nHis kid's up in China\n\nHis wife's up in heaven\n\nAlways I wave\n\n'Cause he's got this expression\n\n\n\nThat he's so alone\n\nDown on Jubilee Road\n\n\n\nOh, I think tomorrow night\n\nI will knock on his door and hear all about his life\n\n'Cause I think that's the kind of thing that I might like\n\nWhen I'm old\n\nWhen I'm old\n\n\n\nThere's Max and there's Maude\n\nIn the house by the station\n\nCall them my best friends\n\nHe drinks like a horse\n\nShe don't appreciate it\n\nAll this money he seems to spend\n\n\n\nI can hear them tonight\n\nHe can't find no vocation\n\nAnd the neighbours they sigh\n\nAt that new generation\n\n\n\nJust getting stoned\n\nDown on Jubilee Road\n\n\n\nOh, I think in the summertime\n\nI will call you up make everything alright\n\nAnd we'll fill up our cups with that bitter wine\n\nAnd I'll show you\n\nI'll show you\n\n\n\nThe mice are still here\n\nYour wardrobe's still empty\n\nAnd the walls are still paper thin\n\nAnd the neighbours, my dear\n\nI think they still hate me\n\nFor all these songs I endlessly sing\n\n\n\n'Cause it ain't no perfect street\n\nI ain't no perfect lover\n\nLife it is brief\n\nI don't think we get no other\n\n\n\nCome back home\n\nDown on Jubilee Road\n\nDown on Jubilee Road"
