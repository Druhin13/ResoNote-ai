  "lyrics": "Everyday I'm awake I almost die, when I was a kid 3 fucking times\r\nI guess it's true what they say, I won't save me\r\nReality dances with my eyes, dilate my own state of mind\r\nI guess it's true what they say, I won't save me\r\n'Cause we tripped and we tripped until our brains fell in a ditch\n\nAnd we never found a fix\n\n'Cause we don't exist\n\n\n\nAre you mad now that I'm too far gone?\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?\n\n\n\nThe fountain of youth's now running dry\n\nAscend the clouds to testify\n\nYou know it's true what they say, I'm too in love with the trip\n\n\n\nAnd we tripped until our brains fell in a ditch\n\nAnd we never found a fix 'cause we don't exist\n\n\n\nAre you mad now that I'm too far gone?\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?\n\nYou can try to keep up now, but you do it all wrong somehow\n\nYou're so mad that you can't be like me, too far gone\n\n\n\nAnd we tripped and we tripped until our brains fell in a ditch\n\nAnd we'll never fucking find the fix\n\n\n\nAre you mad, are you mad now that I'm too far gone?\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone\n\nYou can try to keep up now, but you do it all wrong somehow\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?\n\n\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?\n\nAre you mad that you can't be like me, too far gone?"
