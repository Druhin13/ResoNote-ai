Who do I trust?\n\nMaybe its real, or maybe I'm just...\n\n\n\nParanoid\n\nParanoid\n\nMaybe I'm just\n\nParanoid\n\nParanoid\n\nMaybe I'm just\n\n\n\nNever felt so naked\n\nLookin' at you naked\n\nGot your hands down the back of my soul\n\nAnd the more that I show you, the more I'm afraid\n\nThat you're going to wake up\n\nAnd realize that I'm not the one that you thought I was\n\nThat I thought I was\n\nAm I who I am who am I?\n\n\n\nMaybe it's a case of paranoia\n\nNervous that I'll never really know ya\n\nWhat do I feel? Who do I trust?\n\nMaybe its real\n\nOr maybe I'm just...\n\n\n\nParanoid\n\nParanoid\n\nMaybe I'm just\n\nParanoid\n\nParanoid\n\nMaybe I'm just\n\n\n\nCrazy\n\nBut baby, I love you\n\nAnd baby I'd love to not be...\n\nParanoid\n\nParanoid\n\nI wish I wasn't\n\nParanoid\n\nMaybe I'm just..."
