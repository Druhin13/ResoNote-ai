  "lyrics": "Stay out super late tonight \npicking apples, making pies\r\nput a little something in our lemonade and take it with us\r\nwe're half-awake in a fake empire\r\nwe're half-awake in a fake empire\n\nTiptoe through our shiny city \n\nwith our diamond slippers on\n\ndo our gay ballet on ice\n\nbluebirds on our shoulders\n\nwe're half-awake in a fake empire\n\nwe're half-awake in a fake empire\n\n\n\nTurn the light out say goodnight\n\nno thinking for a little while\n\nlets not try to figure out everything at once\n\nIt's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky\n\nwe're half-awake in a fake empire\n\nwe're half-awake in a fake empire"
