  "lyrics": "Happy in this haze of mine\r\nThis daze ain't leaving\r\nI can roll the dice\r\nThe night is breathing\r\nMisery is magical\n\nIf you are bleeding\n\nDreamers still dream\n\nWithout sleeping\n\n\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh\n\nOh I got electrified\n\nBy your side\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh\n\nOh I got electrified\n\nBy your side\n\n\n\nTake me off the nightingale\n\nMy heart is jumping\n\nGirls and novocaine\n\nMy skin is popping\n\nFloating down the streets of gold\n\nJust like heaven\n\nNow I'm feeling so alive\n\nFeeling something\n\n\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh\n\nOh I got electrified\n\nBy your side\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh\n\nOh I got electrified\n\nBy your side\n\n\n\nThe moon is melting\n\nThe sky is chanting\n\nThe lights are singing\n\nThey go, oh, oh, oh\n\nThe lowest mountain\n\nThe sky is chanting\n\nThe lights are singing\n\nThey go, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh\n\nOh I got electrified\n\nBy your side\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh\n\nOh I got electrified\n\nBy your side\n\nAnd I want you to know, oh"
