  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Dear Yessie par Jessie Reyez\r\nThis is the realest I've ever been, realest I've ever been\nBitch, a minority, they wouldn't let me in\nBitch, a minority, vexing your present\nIf I had a dick then I might get some preference\nI got an ego, but I'm never flexing it\nWhen you're the truth, you ain't worried 'bout replicas\nThis the realest I've ever been, this is the realest I've ever been\nSinging, \"Fuck being delicate\"\n\nI like to fuck with the lights on\nI like to fuck kinda violent, never fuck without a title\nI like it most when I'm writing, you love me most when I'm riding\n\nAnd looking up to me, your bitch gon' look up to me\nI love it when you look up to me, your new bitch gon' look up to me\nRiding, and looking up to me, your bitch gon' look up to me\nI love it when you look up to me, your new bitch gon' look up to me, too\n\nThis is the realest I've ever been, realest I've ever been\nSee all my demons and strip all my skeletons\nI might just kill you if you touch a relative\nUsually nice, but I'm just hella sensitive\nSee all the vipes and I swerve all the venomous\nSell out my show, so the snakes they irrelevant\nDon't fuck with negative, they try to fuck me\nBut two of 'em celibate\n\n\nBut usually I like to fuck with the lights on\nI like to fuck kinda violent, never fuck without a title\nI like it most when I'm writing, you love me most when I'm riding\nAnd looking up to me, your bitch gon' look up to me\nI love it when you look up to me, your new bitch gon' look up to me\nYeah, looking up to me, your new bitch gon' look up to me\nI love it, love it when you look up to me, your new bitch gon' look up to me\n\nI'm trying to die a legend, so I study legacies\nBut these W's don't come without some penalties\nLike Bobby and Amy, now they rest in peace\n\nAnd thank God that this world's been blessing me\nAnd every now and then I feel the world testing me\nFucked up when day one start looking like the enemies\nFucked up when whiskey starts looking like the remedy\nI'm trying to share my life, but I'm precious with my energy\n\nUnbothered, unbothered, unbothered\nImpermeable, unbothered, impermeable, unbothered\nI'm the people's champ, Obama, and you won't understand, Melania\nPermeable, unbothered, sick, allergic to the con artist\n'Choo! Fake woke, 'choo! An imposter, only real ones up in my roster\n\nLike junior T, that's my roster, you know, I just been passed up\nI've been how my shit been fucked up, I've been how my shit been (passed up)"
