  "lyrics": "And in the past I know that we've ended on a sour tone\r\nI dreamt that we packed the car and ended up in Yellowstone\r\nAnd I, I want to see the foreign dress under the moon tree\r\nAnd time, and time will tell all of what you need to know from me\n\nSafe's the kind of word that makes a love grow old and die\n\nI knelt, I wept, the grass was burnt caramel, and your well went dry\n\nAnd we should lose our way before we lose our minds\n\nLose our minds\n\n\n\nAnd I, I want to see your foreign dress under the moon tree\n\nAnd time, and time will tell all of what you need to know from me\n\n\n\nHow was I saved [?]\n\nMeet me where the map ends\n\nI want you in my forest\n\nI know I like a painting\n\nIt's what you're scared to know from me\n\nI want you in my forest\n\nI know I like a painting\n\nIt's what you're scared to know from me\n\nI want you in my forest\n\nI know I like a painting\n\nIt's what you're scared to know from me\n\nI want you in my forest\n\nI know I like a painting\n\nIt's what you're scared to know from me"
