  "lyrics": "I couldn't be happy in the city at night\r\nYou can't see the stars for the neon light\r\nSidewalk's dirty and the river's worse\r\nThe underground trains all run in reverse\r\nNobody here can dance like me\r\nEverybody's clapping on the one and the three\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\n\n\nSo many people with so much to do\n\nThe winter's so cold my hands turn blue\n\nOld men sleeping on the filthy ground\n\nThey spend their whole day just walking around\n\nNobody else here seems to care\n\nThey walk right past them like they ain't even there\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\n\n\nDaddy said the river would always lead me home\n\nBut the river can't take me back in time\n\nAnd daddy's dead and gone\n\nThe family farm's a parking lot for Walton's five and dime\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\n\n\nI tried to go to college but I didn't belong\n\nEverything I said was either funny or wrong\n\nThey laughed at my boots, laughed at my jeans\n\nLaughed when they gave me amphetamines\n\nLeft me alone in a bad part of town\n\nThirty-six hours to come back down\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\n\n\nMama says God won't give you too much to bear\n\nThat might be true in Arkansas\n\nBut I'm a long, long way from there\n\nThat whole world's a lonely, faded picture in my mind\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\nAm I the last of my kind?\n\nAm I the last of my kind?"
