  "lyrics": "The second someone mentioned you were all alone\r\nI could feel the trouble coursing through your veins\r\nNow I know, it's got a hold\r\nJust a phone called left unanswered, had me sparking up\r\nThese cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are\r\nDon't let go, keep a hold\n\n\n\nIf you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill\n\nGuiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be\n\nSafe to feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes\n\nIf you've lost your way...\n\n\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\n\n\nTell me what's been happening, what's been on your mind\n\nLately you've been searching for a darker place\n\nTo hide, that's alright\n\nBut if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us\n\nI refuse to lose another friend to drugs\n\nJust come home, don't let go\n\n\n\nIf you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill\n\nGuiding like a lighthouse to a place where you'll be\n\nSafe to feel at grace 'cause we've all made mistakes\n\nIf you've lost your way...\n\n\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\n\n\nIf you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill\n\nGuiding like a lighthouse, it's a place where you'll be\n\nSafe to feel at grace and if you've lost your way\n\nIf you've lost your way (I will leave the light on)\n\nAnd I know you don't know oh, but I need you to be brave\n\nHiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay\n\nI'll see your pain if you don't feel our grace\n\nAnd you've lost your way\n\nI will leave the light on\n\nI will leave the light on\n\n'Cause I will leave the light on"
