  "lyrics": "And I heard\r\nWith every emphasis you put, on every word\r\nWith every lesson that you taught but never learned\r\nWith every bill you had to pay with money I had earned\r\nSay you always felt the heat but never burned\n\nIn your nest\n\nWhen you gather all your things to head out west\n\nWhen you check if there's still something in your chest\n\nCause you think you really tried, you did your best\n\nTo convince yourself you're good before you rest\n\n\n\nFace the sun, face the sun\n\nFace the sun and fall\n\nYou'll be the one, be the one\n\nBe the one, tomorrow\n\nPlease remember me, I was seventeen\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\n\n\nIn your home\n\nContemplating consequences all alone\n\nWhere you think of jumping fences but you've grown\n\nAnd the things you have, no you don't own\n\nHeld together like your wings they're on it's own\n\n\n\nFace the sun, face the sun\n\nFace the sun and fall\n\nYou'll be the one, be the one\n\nBe the one, tomorrow\n\nPlease remember me, I was seventeen\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\n\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\n\n\nPlease remember me, I was seventeen\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck and follow\n\nAnd follow\n\nI was seventeen, I was seventeen\n\nBreak your neck, break your neck\n\nBreak your neck!"
