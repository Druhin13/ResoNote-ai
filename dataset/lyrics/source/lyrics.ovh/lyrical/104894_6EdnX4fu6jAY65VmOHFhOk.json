  "lyrics": "Hey little girl, is your daddy home?\r\nDid he go away and leave you all alone?\r\nI got a bad desire\r\nOh, oh, oh\r\nI'm on fire\n\nTell me now baby, is he good to you?\n\nCan he do to you the things that I do?\n\nOh no, I can take you higher\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI'm on fire\n\n\n\nSometimes it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull\n\nAnd cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my soul\n\nAt night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet\n\nAnd a freight train running through the middle of my head\n\nOnly you can cool my desire\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI'm on fire\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI'm on fire\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nI'm on fire"
