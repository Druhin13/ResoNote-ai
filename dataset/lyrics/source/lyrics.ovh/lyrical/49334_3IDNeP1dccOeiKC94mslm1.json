We're here tonight...\n\nIt's on tonight\n\nWe're here tonight...\n\nTonight's the night\n\n\n\nJust look around you'll see the whole world gone crazy\n\nI used to blame it on the hippies and stoners and the lazy\n\nCause you need a clear mind when you take it to the street\n\nWhen you lift up the pipe you've already admitted defeat\n\nWe need not just the fists to lift up but the souls to rise\n\nTo fight on against the tyrants and systems we despise\n\nAnd if you're waiting on a hero then we'll all be damned\n\nWhile the politicians laugh on cause it's going just as they planned\n\n\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your fight on!\n\nIt's on tonight... so get your right on!\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your right on!\n\nTonight's the night... let's get our fight on!\n\n\n\nMy head is pounding from the terror\n\nThat's keeps blasting out of the tv\n\nDon't take a genius or a chemist to figure out it's pure insanity\n\nI know it's instinct that try's\n\nTells you that you bet to hide and retreat\n\nBut we've already lost if you're afraid to be beat\n\n\n\nSo get your fight on!\n\nAnd get your right on!\n\nNow get your right on!\n\nAnd get your fight on!\n\n\n\nYou got to believe in a purpose, you got to fight for the just cause\n\nYou got to know the difference of what's right and what's just a law\n\nAnd you got to refuse that urge to ever, ever, ever give up\n\nSo are you ready to take on the fight\n\nCause we know the world's so fucked up\n\nLet's get our fight on!\n\n\n\nAs long as we move as long as we breath now get your right on!\n\nAs long as we live, we'll always believe now got your right on!\n\nAs long as we breath, we'll always believe now got your fight on!\n\n\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your fight on!\n\nIt's on tonight... so get your right on!\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your right on!\n\nTonight's the night...\n\nIt's on tonight... so get your right on\n\nGet your fight on\n\nGet your right on\n\nGet your fight on\n\nGet your right on\n\nGet your fight on\n\n\n\nMy head is pounding from the terror\n\nThat keeps blasting out of the tv\n\nDon't take a genius or a chemist to figure out its pure insanity\n\nI know it's instinct that tries\n\nTells you that you bet to hide and retreat\n\nBut we've already lost if you're afraid to be beat\n\n\n\nGet your fight on\n\nGet your right on!\n\nSo get your right on!\n\nAnd get your fight on!\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your fight on!\n\nIt's on tonight... so get your right on!\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your fight on!\n\nTonight's the night...\n\nIt's on tonight... get your right on\n\n\n\nYou got to believe in a purpose, you got to fight for the just cause\n\nYou got to know the difference of what's right and what's just a law\n\nAnd you got to refuse that urge don't, ever, never give up\n\nSo are you ready to take on the fight\n\nCause we know the world's so fucked up\n\n\n\nGet your fight on!\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your fight on!\n\nIt's on tonight... so get your right on!\n\nWe're here tonight... so get your right on!\n\n\n\nAs long as we move as long as we breath so get your right on!\n\nAs long as we live, we'll always believe so get your right on!\n\nAs long as we breath, we'll always believe so get your fight on!"
