  "lyrics": "The eyes go slowly when you close the door\r\nAnd you leave me here by myself\r\nHow do I fill my days when I feel so sad\r\nThat your warmth has gone away\r\nI bite my lip to stop the tears\n\nBut the tears come anyway\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI don't care if I'm selfish\n\nI want you to stay\n\nEverything, every single thing\n\nEverything I do\n\nI do because I love you\n\n\n\nI'm built to be alone you know\n\nI get anxious when I'm on my own\n\nNo need to be opposite sides of doors\n\nNo need to talk through walls\n\n\n\nI hate that hollow stomach feel\n\nWhen you turn and walk away\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI don't care if I'm selfish\n\nI want you to stay\n\nEverything, every single thing\n\nEverything I do\n\nI do because I love you\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI don't care if I'm selfish\n\nI want you to stay\n\nEverything, every single thing\n\nEverything I do\n\nI do because I love you\n\n\n\nI know I make you feel the guilt\n\nAnd my reasons are emotional\n\nBut we can deal with all demons\n\nIn their various appearance\n\nLet's remind ourselves how far we've come\n\nLet us look at how we really feel\n\nIf we tear from each other\n\nWould we ever fall in love again\n\nEver fall in love again\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI like it when we're together\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI don't care if I'm selfish\n\nI want you to stay\n\nEverything, every single thing\n\nEverything I do\n\nI do because I love you\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI don't care if I'm selfish\n\nI want you to stay\n\nEverything, every single thing\n\nEverything I do\n\nI do because I love you\n\n\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI like it when we're together\n\nI like it when we're together"
