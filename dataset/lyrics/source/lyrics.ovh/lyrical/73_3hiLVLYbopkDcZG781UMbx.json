  "lyrics": "Make enchiladas in the afternoon\r\nLie on the couch in a rented room\r\nWatchin' Jeopardy without the sound\r\nIt's easy to stay down\r\nQuick mistakes and long goodbyes\n\nHold-over truths and necessary lies\n\nI caught a train that was backwards-bound\n\nIt's easy to stay down\n\n\n\nStay down when your mind has been cleared\n\nAnd your trail can't be found\n\nStay down with your eye to the sky\n\nAnd your ear to the ground\n\n\n\nDown by the pool with all my brand-new friends\n\nRe-writin' letters that I never sent\n\nDeclinin' invitations into town\n\nIt's easy to stay down\n\n\n\nSlowly admit that you have had your fun\n\nThe girl you loved and every word you sung\n\nAll the profane that you thought profound\n\nIt's time now to stay down\n\n\n\nStay down when the smoke is cleared\n\nAnd you name can be found\n\nStay down with your head in the clouds\n\nAnd your eyes to the ground\n\n\n\nFeel the sting of the final blow\n\nWhat could've been, you don't care or know\n\nDon't try to go another round\n\nStay down"
