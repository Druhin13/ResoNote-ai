  "lyrics": "(Rod Temperton) \nNo more runnin' down the wrong road \nDancin' to a diff'rent drum \nCan't you see what's goin' on \nDeep inside your heart \n\nAlways searchin' for the real thing \n\nLivin' like it's far away \n\nJust leave all the madness in yesterday \n\nYou're holdin' the key \n\nWhen you believe it \n\n\n\n[Chorus:] \n\nShine sweet freedom \n\nShine your light on me \n\nYou are the magic \n\nYou're right where I wanna be \n\nOh sweet freedom carry me along \n\nWe'll keep the spirit alive on and on \n\n\n\nWe'll be dancin' in the moonlight \n\nSmilin' with the risin' sun \n\nLivin' like we've never done \n\nGoin' all the way \n\nReachin' out to meet the changes \n\nTouchin' every shining star \n\nThe light of tomorrow is right where we are \n\nThere's no turnin' back \n\nFrom what I'm feeling \n\n\n\n[Chorus] \n\n\n\nCoz there'll be starlight all night \n\nWhen we're close together \n\nShare those feelings dancin' in your eyes \n\nTonight they're guiding us \n\nShinin' till the mornin' light"
