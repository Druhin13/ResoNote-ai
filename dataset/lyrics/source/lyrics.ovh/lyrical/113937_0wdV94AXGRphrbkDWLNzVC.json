  "lyrics": "Broadway is black like a sinkhole\r\nEveryone raced to the suburbs\r\nAnd I'm on the rooftop with curious strangers\r\nThis is the oddest of summers\r\nMaybe I'll medicate, maybe inebriate\r\nStrange situations, I get anxious\n\nMaybe I'll smile a bit, maybe the opposite\n\nBut pray that they don't call me thankless\n\n\n\nMy tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest\n\nCut me a silk-tied tourniquet\n\n\n\nThis is my roaring, roaring 20's\n\nI don't even know me\n\nRoll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home\n\nRoll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home\n\nMy roaring, roaring 20s\n\nI don't even know me\n\nRoll me like a blunt, ‘cause I wanna go home\n\nRoll me like a blunt, ‘cause I want, I wanna go home\n\n\n\nOscars and Emmy's and Grammy's\n\nEveryone here is a trophy\n\nAnd I'm sipping bourbon\n\nThe future's uncertain\n\nThe past on the pavement below me\n\nMaybe I'll elevate, maybe I'm second rate\n\nSo unaware of my status\n\nMaybe I'm overjoyed, maybe I'm paranoid\n\nDesigner me up in straight jackets\n\n\n\nMy tell-tale heart's a hammer in my chest\n\nCut me a silk-tied tourniquet\n\n\n\nThis is my roaring, roaring 20's\n\nI don't even know me\n\nRoll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home\n\nRoll me like a blunt, cause I wanna go home\n\nMy roaring, roaring 20s\n\nI don't even know me\n\nRoll me like a blunt, ‘cause I wanna go home\n\nRoll me like a blunt, ‘cause I want, I wanna go home\n\n\n\nHallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire\n\nIt's Lord of the Flies in my mind tonight\n\nI don't know if I will survive\n\nLighters up if you're feelin' me\n\nFade to black if you're not mine\n\n'Cause I just need a sign, or a signal inside\n\n\n\nThis is my roaring, roaring 20s\n\nI don't even know me\n\nRoll me a blunt cause I wanna go home\n\nRoll me a, roll me a blunt\n\nThis is my roaring, roaring 20s\n\nI don't even know me\n\nRoll me like a blunt cause I wanna go home\n\nRoll me like a blunt cause I want, I wanna go home\n\n\n\nI wanna go home"
