  "lyrics": "I'd like to tour the 80s\r\nBut I got sideswiped and came right to '78\r\nMy life is pro creation\r\nWell if the mood's right, there's some hype, some currency\r\nSo, deep breath, deep breath, keep grabbing\r\nWell I like, my life is pro creation\n\nSo I make time to rewind those memories and play\n\n\n\n'Cause you and me make a fine mess\n\nYou and me make a fine mess\n\nYou're on\n\n\n\nYou get high like you chase the natives\n\nAnd you tried then to show them your come-and-see face\n\nI like this elevation\n\nThe mood's right, the dim light, and we can see them\n\nDeep breath, deep breath, keep grabbing\n\nWell I like, I like to change the station\n\n'Cause these thoughts are those thoughts that cover me in grey\n\n\n\nYou and me make a fine mess\n\nYou and me make a fine mess\n\nYou and me make a fine mess\n\nYou're always shattered\n\n\n\nLately something has come over all of me\n\nMy welts all undressed, no longer seem to weep\n\nThat no longer meets their needs\n\nI like the stage so please\n\nHolla at The Weeknd for me\n\n\n\nYou and me, you and me make a fine mess\n\n'Cause you and me make a fine mess\n\nYou're always shattered"
