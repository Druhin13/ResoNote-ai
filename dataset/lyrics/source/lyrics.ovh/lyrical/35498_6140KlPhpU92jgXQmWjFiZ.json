  "lyrics": "Coming on fast, try to take it slow\r\nI'm a red flag at a rodeo\r\nNeed to take a trip, get some time alone\r\nAnd I'm calling you from Tokyo\r\nBut the last time I saw you\n\nI didn't mean to ignore you\n\n\n\nI know its been a while but i'm back again\n\nBack to face the symphony\n\nAnything you need just call on me\n\nI'm holding on day and night desperately\n\nIf you got a problem baby lay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\n\n\nI didn't wanna get under your skin\n\nDid I complicate the simple things?\n\nSwimming out to sea in the pouring rain\n\nIts easy to get lost when you don't know the way\n\n\n\nBut the last time I saw you\n\nI didn't mean to ignore you\n\n\n\nI know its been a while but i'm back again\n\nBack to face the symphony\n\nAnything you need just call on me\n\nI'm holding on day and night desperately\n\nIf you got a problem baby lay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\n\n\nLay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me\n\nLay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me\n\nLay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me\n\nLay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me, Lay it on me\n\n\n\nI know its been a while but i'm back again\n\nBack to face the symphony\n\nAnything u need just call on me\n\nI'm holding on day and night desperately\n\nIf you got a problem baby lay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\nCome on, lay it on me\n\nLay it on me\n\nLay it on me"
