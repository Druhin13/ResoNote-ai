  "lyrics": "It's been seven hours and thirteen days\r\nSince you took your love away\r\nI go out all night and sleep all day\r\nSince you took your love away\r\nSince you been gone I can do whatever I want\n\nI can see who ever I choose\n\nI can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant\n\nBut nothing nothing can take away these blues\n\n\n\nCause nothing compares\n\nNothing compares to you\n\n\n\nIt's been so lonely without you here\n\nLike a bird without a song\n\nNothing can stop these lonely tears from falling\n\nTell me where did I go wrong\n\n\n\nI could put my arms around any girl I see\n\nBut they only reminds me of you\n\nI went to the doctor and guess what it told me, guess what it told me\n\nSaid, \"Boy, you better try to have fun no matter what you do.\"\n\nBut he's a fool\n\n\n\nCause nothing compares\n\nNothing compares to you\n\n\n\nAll the flowers that you planted, baby\n\nIn your back yard\n\nAll died when you went away\n\nI know living with me baby is sometimes hard\n\nBut I'm willing, see I'm willing to give it another try\n\n\n\nNothing compares\n\nNothing compares to you\n\nCause nothing compares\n\nNothing compares to you"
