  "lyrics": "Now that the holidays have come\r\nThey can relax and watch the sun\r\nRise above all\r\nof the beautiful things\r\nThey've done.\n\nGo to the country take the dog\n\nLook at the sky without the smog\n\nSee the world laugh\n\nat the farmers feeding hogs\n\nEat hot dogs.\n\n\n\nWhat a pity\n\nThat the people from the city\n\nCan't relate to the slower things\n\nThat the country brings.\n\n\n\nTime itself is bought and sold.\n\nThe spreading fear of growing old\n\nContains a thousand foolish games\n\nThat we play.\n\n\n\nWhile people\n\nplanning trips to stars\n\nAllow another boulevard to claim\n\nA quiet country lane\n\nIt's insane.\n\n\n\nSo the subtle face is a loser\n\nThis time around.\n\nHere we are in the years\n\nWhere the showman\n\nshifts the gears\n\nLives become careers\n\nChildren cry in fear\n\nLet us out of here!"
