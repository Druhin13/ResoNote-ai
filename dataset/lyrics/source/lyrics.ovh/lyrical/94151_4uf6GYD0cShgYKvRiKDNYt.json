  "lyrics": "Oh damn\r\nVolume way up on my phone\r\nAnd\r\nNext to my head on the floor\r\nAnd\r\nBeats on repeat\n\nThe rain tap dancin’ on my windowpane\n\nWhoever said no pain, no gain\n\nDon’t know pain\n\nIntimately like I do\n\nAs infinitely as I do\n\nBeen lied about and lied to\n\nToo many times to fight it\n\nSome bridges were built to burn\n\nNo need to help ignite it\n\nA party of one or party of none\n\nPlease keep me disinvited\n\nTuck you in\n\nAs I tuck another tear behind my eyelids\n\n\n\nGood night"
