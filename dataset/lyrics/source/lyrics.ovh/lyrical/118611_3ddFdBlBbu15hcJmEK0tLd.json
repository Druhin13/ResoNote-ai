Yo\n\nEven when the sun goes down, I'm up tryna keep my family straight\n\nI just be holdin' it down and every real nigga gonna gravitate\n\nEvery day ten toes down, I swear I ain't never goin' down this way\n\nMy nigga, I'm not your man, you don't know me, I ain't from 'round this way\n\nGo hard, I'ma die when I sleep\n\nGo hard, I can sleep when I die\n\nTryna find a piece of my mind\n\n\n\nYou can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying\n\nLook me in the eyes and tell that I've cried\n\nPlenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them\n\nRemember those who win, not the ones tired\n\nLook into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?\n\nLately, watching you, watching me\n\nLately, watching you, watching me\n\nLook into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?\n\nLately, watching you, watching me\n\nAngry, watching you, watching me\n\n\n\nEh, ever since I came up, yeah, I've been\n\nLiving like tomorrow ain't gon' come\n\nSwitching girls like my heart can't go numb\n\nPedal to the floor like I'm on the run\n\nAll this shine, all the rain gotta glum\n\nGotta get mine or it's back to the slums\n\nBack to the crumbs\n\nI don't feel the pain, I need a little luck\n\nAnd I puff my herb and I sip my drink\n\n'Til my words get slurred\n\nI work that bitch 'til she work my nerves\n\nAnd then move on to the next city like \"word\"\n\nWhat I do is none of your concern\n\nI take my shot, you can wait your turn\n\nEvery single thing I got I earned\n\n'Cause every single loss is lesson learned, yeah (Jxm!)\n\n\n\nYou're the reason why my back is turned (You're the reason)\n\nOnly took one time for me to learn\n\nI won't say a thing you don't deserve\n\nI won't do a thing you don't deserve (Yeah)\n\nI x you out, what for?\n\nBecause survival's my only choice\n\nI'm living life like I know it's short\n\nOh, it's a miracle to find remorse\n\n\n\nYou can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying\n\nLook me in the eyes and tell that I've cried\n\nPlenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them\n\nRemember those who win, not the ones tired\n\nLook into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?\n\nLately, watching you, watching me\n\nLately, watching you, watching me\n\nLook into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?\n\nLately, watching you, watching me\n\nAngry, watching you, watching me"
