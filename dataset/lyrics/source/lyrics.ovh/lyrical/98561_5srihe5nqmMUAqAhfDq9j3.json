  "lyrics": "Here I am, once again\r\nRunning low on oxygen\r\nCause you're the air I'm breathing\r\nYou were all that I believe in\r\nIn my room, covered in dust\n\nWhile all my trophies rust\n\nI am cold and I am wanting\n\nSomething warm to keep blood pumping\n\n\n\nI hear your voice inside my brain\n\nI keep you here to stop my pain\n\n\n\nYou are golden and\n\nYou are flowing through me\n\nYou are ecstacy\n\nYou are, you are\n\nYou are my dopamine\n\n\n\nAnother day, another face\n\nWithout you around my place\n\nYou're an ocean pulling me in\n\nYou were the marks upon my skin\n\n\n\nCovered up in my sheets\n\nFolding over your heartbeats\n\nBut I still feel it in my fingertips\n\nI hold it tightly in my person\n\n\n\nI hear your voice inside my brain\n\nI keep you here to stop my pain\n\nBack in my heart and in my veins\n\nKeeping me numb like novacaine\n\n\n\nYou are golden and\n\nYou are flowing through me\n\nYou are ecstacy\n\nYou are, you are\n\nYou are my dopamine\n\n\n\nYou are desperation\n\nYou are motivating me\n\nYou are benzodrine\n\nYou are, you are\n\nYou are my dopamine\n\n\n\nI hear your voice inside my brain\n\nI keep you here to stop my pain\n\nYou are the one I see when I fall asleep\n\nAnd I think of no one else but\n\n\n\nYou are golden and\n\nYou are flowing through me\n\nYou are ecstacy\n\nYou are, you are\n\nYou are my dopamine\n\n\n\nYou are desperation\n\nYou are motivating me\n\nYou are benzodrine\n\nYou are, you are\n\nYou are my dopamine"
