I bought her\n\nYour bitch get caught up\n\nLife gon' get you caught up\n\nThat's why I tat up my body\n\nThat's what I can't trust nobody\n\nMy niggas the wildest\n\nWe used to fuck up the parties\n\nGirls gave me that sloppy\n\nLate night in that dungeon\n\n\n\nBut I'll be true\n\nIf you promise that you'll defend me\n\nI'll be true, to you\n\nAnd what you are, can lay here firmly\n\nI'll do the worrying, baby\n\nI ain't saying \"I ain't crazy\"\n\n\n\nDon't put me down\n\nIf you can be honest then\n\n(Teach these babies how to love, they won't know how to hate if you show 'em something different)\n\nI'll do anything\n\nI'll go all the way\n\nI'll jump off a plane\n\nTarget on my chest, for you\n\n(Oh, if you can)\n\nIf you can be honest, then\n\nI'll do anything\n\nI'll go all the way\n\nI'll jump off a plane\n\nTarget on my chest, for you"
