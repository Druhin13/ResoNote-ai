  "lyrics": "Oh July\r\nIt's better off since April died\r\nI can see September through the trees\r\nAnd I can't lie\r\nThere's more to know than what's inside\r\nMaybe there's some reason in my memories\n\nBut all I know\n\nIt's easier to love you when I'm gone\n\nBut it's hard for me to leave\n\nI don't know\n\nThis anger is helping anyone\n\nAnd I don't know what I need\n\n\n\nOh St. Marie\n\nClose my eyes before you leave\n\nSo I don't have to look at you in shame\n\nOh St. Marie\n\nTake my hand and give me peace\n\nCause I don't think I'll ever be the same\n\n\n\nHere comes the broken hearts\n\nJust as the music starts\n\nOne by one it turns to five\n\nI never did enough\n\nI never cared enough\n\nEven though I stood, I always ran away\n\nWe all wonder why\n\nIt's easier to blame the ones you love\n\nCause it's harder to believe\n\nThat we fall sometimes\n\nNo matter how I try, I've given up\n\nBut now I have a chance to be\n\n\n\nOh St. Marie\n\nClose my eyes before you leave\n\nSo I don't have to look at you in shame\n\nOh St. Marie\n\nTake my hand and give me peace\n\nCause I don't think I'll ever be the same\n\n\n\nSometimes the quiet ones\n\nAre all I want to be\n\nThere's only so much left\n\nThe rest is up to me\n\nYou're all I ever want\n\nI hope you feel it comes\n\nAs far as I'm concerned\n\nYou're exactly what I need\n\n\n\nOh St. Marie\n\nClose my eyes before you leave\n\nSo I don't have to look at you in shame\n\nOh St. Marie\n\nTake my hand and give me peace\n\nCause I don't think I'll ever be the same\n\nCause I don't think I'll ever be the same\n\nCause I don't think I'll ever be the same"
