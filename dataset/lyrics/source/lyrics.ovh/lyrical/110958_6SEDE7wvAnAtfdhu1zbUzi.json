  "lyrics": "I wish I would've laid my hands on you\r\nShown you a thing or two\r\nI wish I would've pushed you against the wall\r\nLock the door and bathroom stall, windows and the screen\r\nI wish you would've laid your hands on me\r\nThat kind gon' bring me to my knees\n\nI wish I would've let you lay me down\n\nCause I wouldn't be here wishing now\n\nI wish I would've laid my hands on you\n\n\n\nI wish I was still half drunk\n\nStill tangled up\n\nStill making love\n\nBut instead I'm alone in bed with you in my head\n\nCan't get you out of my head\n\nMmm, mmm\n\nMy only regret\n\n\n\nI wish I would've laid my hands on you\n\nGot you high in a motel room\n\nLittle secret for my soul\n\nNo one sees and no one knows\n\nForbidden company\n\nI wish you would've laid your hands on me\n\nAnd never let me go\n\nDrawing pictures on my skin\n\nPlaces no one's ever been\n\nI wish I would've laid my hands on you\n\n\n\nI wish I was still half drunk\n\nStill tangled up\n\nStill making love\n\nBut instead I'm alone in bed with you in my head\n\nCan't get you out of my head\n\nMmm, mmm\n\nMy only regret\n\n\n\nI wish I would've laid my hands on you\n\nShown you a thing or two\n\nI wish I would've pushed you against the wall\n\nLock the door and bathroom stall, windows and the screen\n\nI wish you would've laid your hands on me\n\nThat kind gon' bring you to your knees\n\nI wish I would've let you lay me down\n\nCause I wouldn't be here wishing now\n\nI wish I would've laid my hands on you"
