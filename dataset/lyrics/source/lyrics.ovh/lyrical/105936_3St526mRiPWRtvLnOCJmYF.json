  "lyrics": "I've been walled in for so long\r\nWith just enough of the love I lost\r\nWatching from the sidelines\r\nWaiting for signs that it's alright\r\nCause I will float through the night time\n\nAnd I get lost in the daylight\n\nBut I can't follow to meet you\n\nYou're far away but I'm\n\nOut on the other side\n\n\n\nImages of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah\n\nImages of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah\n\nThat I can't let go, o-o-o-o-o-oh\n\n\n\nAre you with me?\n\nAre you with me?\n\n\n\nI can feel your heart beating soft now\n\nJust telling me that I'll be fine\n\nWhen you're gone I could never know\n\nSo tell me where the love goes\n\n\n\nCause I will float through the night time\n\nAnd I get lost in the daylight\n\nBut I can't follow to meet you\n\nYou're far away but I'm\n\nOut on the other side\n\n\n\nImages of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah\n\nImages of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah\n\nThat I can't let go, o-o-o-o-o-oh\n\n\n\nImages of you, wo-o-o-o-o-o-oah\n\nThat I can't let go, o-o-o-o-o-oh"
