  "lyrics": "It comes and goes in waves\r\nIt always runs back but it's never quite the same\r\nWell I think there's something wrong with me\r\nGot nothing to believe, can't you see it on my face\r\nI was going for the title, got hit by your tidal wave, uh\n\nCan't stay in the shallows, please tell me I won't wash away\n\n\n\nWhen it pulls me under, will you make me stronger\n\nWill you be my breath through the deep, deep water\n\nTake me farther, give me one day longer\n\nWill you be my breath through the deep, deep water\n\n\n\n(Deep water)\n\n\n\n(Deep water)\n\n\n\nAin't even scratched the surface\n\nThinking I deserve the dream but I don't deserve the hurting\n\nI want the flame without the burning\n\nBut I can't find my purpose when I don't know what my worth is\n\n\n\nI was going for the title, got hit by your tidal wave, uh\n\nCan't stay in the shallows, please tell me I won't wash away\n\n\n\nWhen it pulls me under, will you make me stronger\n\nWill you be my breath through the deep, deep water\n\nTake me farther, give me one day longer\n\nWill you be my breath through the deep, deep water\n\n\n\n(Deep water)\n\n\n\n(Deep water)\n\n\n\nWhen I'm sinking like a stone\n\nAt least I know I'm not alone\n\nWhen I'm sinking like a stone\n\nAt least I know I'm not alone\n\n\n\nWhen it pulls me under, will you make me stronger\n\nWill you be my breath through the deep, deep water\n\nTake me farther, give me one day longer\n\nWill you be my breath through the deep, deep water\n\n\n\n(Deep water)\n\nWhen I'm sinking like a stone\n\n(Deep water)\n\nAt least I know I'm not alone\n\n\n\nIt comes and goes in waves\n\nIt always runs back but it's never quite the same"
