  "lyrics": "I want it all\r\nI'll watch the bridges all burn\r\nAnd I'll be your dog\r\nI'd be a darling for you\r\nOr anyone who wants me at all\r\nDoes anybody want me at all?\n\n\n\n'Cause I'd sell my soul\n\nTo be America's pool boy\n\nThe crown centerfold\n\nMy few good years left, a tribute\n\nTo anyone who wants me at all\n\nDoes anybody want me at all?\n\nOh, do you want me at all?\n\n\n\nDo you want me at all?\n\nDo you want me at all?\n\n\n\nAw, do you want me at all?\n\n\n\nI've got it all\n\nI feel the love in suspension\n\nAnd nearer my god\n\nAt hallowed ground, holding hands\n\nAshing cigarettes on gravestones\n\nPin photographs on cork boards\n\nUnfollowing my dead friends\n\nSomeone's gonna love me\n\n\n\nOh, do you want me?\n\nDo you want me at all?\n\n\n\nDo you want me at all?"
