  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Run For Your Life par K.Flay\r\nDon't count me out\nJust cause I'm down\nBoy I've been down before\nFate has a way of playing games\nAnd I've been keeping score\nThey tried to tell me I was lost in the forest\nLike a cub with no mother when I actually was where I wanted\n\nBite off the venomous head\nFollow the chemical scent\nLook for the hole in the fence\nTake everything you demand\nFast as you can\nAnd run for your life\nRun for your life\n\n\nDon't show your face\nThey'll lock the cage\nIf you're an easy mark\nI made a plan\nOf sweet revenge\nI want to take it too far\n\nBite off the venomous head\nFollow the chemical scent\nLook for the hole in the fence\nTake everything you demand\nFast as you can\nAnd run for your life\nRun for your life\n\nRun for your life\nRun for your life\n\nRun for your life\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\nOh-uh, oh-oh\n\nBite off the venomous head\nFight what the chemicals say\nLook for the hole in the fence\nTake everything you demand\nFast as you can\nAnd run for your life\nRun for your life\nRun for your life\n\nRun for your life"
