  "lyrics": "Thinking about leaving this\r\nWonder if I'll be missed?\r\nThinking 'bout what we would lose\r\nWish I set charm in blues\r\nLet's talk about broken love\r\nThe one we always had\n\nThere's things I can't forgive\n\nThere's things I still regret\n\n\n\nFill in the space when there's no one around\n\nI'm licking your wounds when you fall to the ground\n\nThere's better to realize\n\nWe need that broken love\n\nDrown in the ocean, but when we wake up\n\nWe rise like a fire, but never enough\n\nWe need that broken love\n\nWe need that broken love\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n(Broken, broken love)\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n(Broken, broken love)\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n\n\nSunday mornings in our bed\n\nDon't remember what we said\n\nSupposed to talk it out\n\nBut we make love instead\n\nAll because this broken love\n\nHas got a hold on me\n\nYou're all I'm thinking of\n\nYou hurt so tenderly\n\n\n\nFill in the space when there's no one around\n\nI'm licking your wounds when you fall to the ground\n\nThere's better to realize\n\nWe need that broken love\n\nDrown in the ocean, but when we wake up\n\nWe rise like a fire, but never enough\n\nWe need that broken love\n\nWe need that broken love\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n(Broken, broken love)\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n(Broken, broken love)\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n\n\n(Broken, broken love)\n\nWe need that broken love\n\n(Broken, broken love)\n\nWe need that broken love"
