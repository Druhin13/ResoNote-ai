  "lyrics": "I didn't make it this far\r\nJust to make it this far\r\nThis is part of the cycle\r\nThis the part when the flower starts to bloom after rain\r\nAnd gets the nutrients it needs to grow again\n\nThis the part when the sun sets\n\nAnd the night time starts to overload your brain\n\nBut the sun will always rise in the morning\n\n\n\nI didn't make it this far\n\nI didn't make it this far\n\nJust to make it this far\n\n(Just to make it this far)\n\nI didn't work this damn hard\n\nI didn't work this damn hard\n\nNot to leave my own mark\n\n\n\nThis is part of the cycle\n\nThis the part when you lose something you work so hard to gain\n\nBut the universe will always have it's way\n\nTo prove to you it wasn't a mistake\n\nThis just part of the cycle\n\nAnd you have to learn to move out of it's way\n\nAnd you'll figure out the reason why someday\n\n\n\nI didn't make it this far\n\nI didn't make it this far\n\nJust to make it this far\n\n(Just to make it this far)\n\nI didn't work this damn hard\n\nI didn't work this damn hard\n\nNot to leave my own mark"
