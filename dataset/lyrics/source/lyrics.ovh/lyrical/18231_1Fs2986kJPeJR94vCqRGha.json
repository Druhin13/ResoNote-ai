  "lyrics": "Big Mac boxes, Bud Light cans\r\nScattered all around my bachelor pad\r\nMud on my boots, holes in my blue jeans\r\nAin't never been the kind to keep my truck clean\r\nBlowin' my money on Friday nights\n\nWakin' up hurtin' from drunk bar fights\n\nBut she's tuggin' on my heartstrings\n\n\n\nI don't like change, she don't care\n\nI'm gettin' up early, I'm combin' my hair\n\nI try to fight but she don't fight fair\n\nI may not like it, but man I swear\n\nShe's tuggin' on my heartstrings\n\n\n\nI like to watch ESPN\n\nBut Lifetime movies, they never end\n\nShe can throw down with all of my redneck friends\n\nMy man cave she done caved in\n\n\n\nWell she's always right, I'm always wrong\n\nI should be mad, but it turns me on\n\nWhen she's tuggin' on my heartstrings\n\n\n\nI don't like change, she don't care\n\nI'm gettin' up early, I'm combin' my hair\n\nI try to fight but she don't fight fair\n\nI may not like it, but man I swear\n\nShe's tuggin' on my heartstrings\n\n\n\nI don't like change, she don't care\n\nI'm gettin' up early, I'm combin' my hair\n\nI try to fight but she don't fight fair\n\nI may not like it, but man I swear\n\nShe's tuggin' on my heartstrings\n\nYeah, she's tuggin' on my heartstrings\n\nWell she's tuggin' on my heartstrings"
