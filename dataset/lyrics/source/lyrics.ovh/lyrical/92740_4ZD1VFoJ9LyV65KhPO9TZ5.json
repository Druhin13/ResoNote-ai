to\n\nYou rich, I'm rich as a bitch too\n\nI'll spin a dub in this bitch too\n\nAnd bitch I stay with Sizzle\n\nWe made a lot from little\n\nExotic chucks from out the Runtz\n\nI fill the blunt with Skittles\n\nAnd bitch, this clique don't fit you\n\nPause, suck a dick too\n\nYou know I stay glued to this pistol\n\nCock that bitch back, it's the ritual\n\nBitches like pitbulls, I'ma sic at you\n\nGotta get you up outta here, we sinkin' you\n\nHad to hop out the Audi and get the coupe\n\nGot two Bentleys, them bitches identical\n\n'Bout to get a Lambo truck when it drop\n\nTold foenem it's merch, that's on Rock\n\nThat don't mean after that I'm gon' stop\n\nI might get another whip if it's more hot\n\nYou know I ain't gotta ride with the door locked\n\nGot some shit on my lap like a robot\n\nSo I gotta bust a left at the roadblock\n\nBust a right, hop out on your block\n\nWe ain't tryna spot you, that's adios\n\nFuck around and get did like Geronimo\n\nCould see that boy head when you got close\n\nHe was fuckin' with somebody mama, though\n\nIn the street all you got is your honor, though\n\nGet respect, yeah, that bitch like a pot of gold\n\nWent to school of hard knocks and graduated\n\nYeah, I stayed on the block like the honor roll\n\nBut I stayed bumpin' heads with my mama though\n\nStarted gettin' money, now she think she my homie\n\nBought a Glock, I ain't get it from Carlos\n\nI was livin' two blocks right up off Stoney\n\nShoot this bitch broad day if you run up on me\n\nTwo hundred in the crib so I'm comin' home, then\n\nYou ain't even got five hundred to your name\n\nCouldn't even bury yourself, pussy, run along, then\n\nNow your mama fucked up, callin' your homies\n\nAnd they broke as fuck, tell me what they gon' load in?\n\nBullets leave a nigga fucked up like pneumonia\n\nNah, nigga got me fucked up, run up on him\n\nMan, a nigga done lucked up, he ain't a goner\n\nMan, this bitch done jammed up, I don't want here\n\nMan, hand me that other bitch, spin the corner\n\nMan, you on that sucker shit, spin the corner, uh\n\n\n\nYerk 30 high, real dirty Sprite\n\nBitch, you heard me right\n\nLive a dirty life, clutch my 30 tight\n\nEatin' at the gangster table, splittin' dirty rice\n\nBitch, this shit like Cosa Nostra, yeah, you heard it right\n\nMight teach you how to beat a murder if you word it right\n\nI made a lot out a little\n\nI ain't gon' hop out, I'm with you\n\nI ain't gon' plot against you\n\nIf they turn, I'm hoppin' the fence too\n\n\n\nYou'd be surprised\n\nIf you need me, what you find\n\nI'm like beep beep, GT flyin'\n\nAnd I'm knee-deep in these diamonds\n\nNot yet, you ain't realized\n\nGot opportunities, you just minimizing\n\nYou just want immunity and you'll disguise in it\n\nOoh, I should put one of your eyes in it\n\nDidn't your granny ever tell you to mind business?\n\nIt's only yours, pussy, close them doors, pussy\n\nWe don't got no two neighbors on the same floor, ain't no recordin', looky\n\nI smoke exotic, ditched the Runtz, Biscotti or some more Cookie\n\nThat shit you smokin' on a hundred a zip, you can't afford lookin'\n\nLil' bro countin' racks he made off sports, he like his own bookie\n\nI just left from Saks to find the shorts that match my Fendi hoodie\n\nThey offered me 200 racks to wear this clothing line, I should've took it\n\nI told 'em I need a milli' 'cause I stay fresh as fuck, I was bein' bumptious\n\nReally I was bein' silly, 'cause that shit was wack as fuck, I ain't even want shit\n\nBelaire sent my money a couple months ago, I ain't even touched it\n\nTold 'em I want it full when I go on tour, but that's another subject\n\nKnow I'ma bring the gang but we'll speak later 'cause that's another budget\n\nAfterparty's booked, that's another quarter just to go out in public\n\nKnow foenem tryna fuck with all the hoes and shit so I'm like, \"Fuck it\"\n\nEverybody came to party, but a few startin' some', what's all that ruckus?\n\nKnow we gon' go retarded, bitch, it's hundred shots on all our busters\n\n\n\nYerk 30 high, real dirty Sprite\n\nBitch, you heard me right\n\nLive a dirty life, clutch my 30 tight\n\nEatin' at the gangster table, splittin' dirty rice\n\nBitch, this shit like Cosa Nostra, yeah, you heard it right\n\nMight teach you how to beat a murder if you word it right\n\nI made a lot out a little\n\nI ain't gon' hop out, I'm with you\n\nI ain't gon' plot against you\n\nIf they turn, I'm hoppin' the fence too"
