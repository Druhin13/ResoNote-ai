  "lyrics": "I got my toes in the water, ass in the \nsand\r\nNot a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand\r\nLife is good today. Life is good today. \nWell, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock\n\nAnd the city's still on my mind\n\nBikinis and palm trees danced in my head\n\nI was still in the baggage line\n\nConcrete and cars are there own prison bars like this life I'm living in\n\nBut the plane brought me farther. \n\nI'm surrounded by water\n\nAnd I'm not going back again\n\n\n\nI got my toes in the water, ass in the sand\n\nNot a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand\n\nLife is good today. Life is good today.\n\n\n\nAdios and vaya con dios\n\nYeah I'm leaving GA\n\nAnd if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas\n\nI'd have no reason to stay\n\nAdios and vaya con dios\n\nYeah I'm leaving GA\n\nGonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one\n\nAnd grab my guitar and play\n\n\n\nFour days flew by like a drunk Friday night as the summer \n\ndrew to an end\n\nThey can't believe that I just couldn't leave \n\nAnd I bid adieu to my friends\n\nBecause my bartender she's from the islands\n\nHer body's been kissed by the sun\n\nAnd coconut replaces the smell of the bar and I don't know if its her or the \n\nrum\n\n\n\nI got my toes in the water, ass in the sand\n\nNot a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand\n\nLife is good today. Life is good today.\n\n\n\nAdios and vaya con dios\n\nA long way from GA\n\nIts where all the muchachas they call me \"big poppa\" when I throw pesos their \n\nway\n\nAdios and vaya con dios\n\nA long way from GA\n\nSomeone do me a favor and pass me the Jaeger\n\nAnd I'll grab my guitar and play\n\n\n\nAdios and vaya con dios\n\nGoing home now to stay\n\nThe senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero\n\nYou got no money to stay\n\nAdios and vaya con dios\n\nGoing home now to stay\n\n\n\nWith my ass in a lawn chair\n\nAnd toes in the clay\n\nNot a worry in the world a PBR on the way\n\nLife is good today. Life is good today\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Amanda for these lyrics and to abba2u for these corrections)"
