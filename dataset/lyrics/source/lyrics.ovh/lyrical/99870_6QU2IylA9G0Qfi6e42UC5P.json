  "lyrics": "What would it sound like if you were the songwriter\r\nAnd you made your living off of me\r\nWould you detail your near-constant consternation\r\nOr the way my very presence makes your muses up and flee\r\nGoodbye, little songbird, I can leave\n\nGoodbye, my love, is there anything else you need?\n\n\n\nWhat would it sound like if you were the songwriter\n\nAnd you did your living around me?\n\nWould you undress me repeatedly in public\n\nTo show how very noble and naked you can be?\n\n\n\nGoodbye, little songbird, now you're free\n\nDon't forget I'm the only fan of yours who has the sense to ever leave you be\n\nHow could you do this to me?\n\n\n\nWhat would it sound like if you were the songwriter\n\nAnd loving me was your unsung masterpiece?"
