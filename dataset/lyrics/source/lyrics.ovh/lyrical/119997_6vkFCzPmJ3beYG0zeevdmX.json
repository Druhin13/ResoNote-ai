  "lyrics": "Take a trip, follow me\r\nTo the sun, to the sea\r\nCrystal hair in the breeze\r\nGonna let it fall over me\r\nTake your hands off the wheel\r\nTake em off, take em off\n\nLet it go, let it breathe\n\nTake some time, come with me\n\n\n\nI've never been one to wait\n\nSo give me your helmet then\n\nCause every time you look at me\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\n\n\nNight swims in the rain\n\nWanna take a trip, hope to strafe\n\nFingertips on your waist\n\nYou and I feel the same\n\n\n\nI've never been one to wait\n\nSo give me your helmet then\n\nCause every time you look at me\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\n\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes\n\nI see you in everything\n\nI see myself in your eyes"
