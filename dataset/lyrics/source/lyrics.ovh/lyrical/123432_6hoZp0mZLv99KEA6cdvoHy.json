  "lyrics": "We used to chase that Chattanooga freight\r\nCouple a kids in a Chevrolet\r\nCatch a little air when we cross the tracks\r\nSipping on something from a paper sack\r\nYou hang your shirt on that maple limb\r\nSlipping through the moon to the river bend\n\nWasn't very long til I was jumping in, jumping in\n\nI guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then\n\n\n\nChasing you like a shot of whiskey\n\nBurning going down, burning going down\n\nChasing you like those goodbye taillights\n\nHeading west to anywhere out of this no where town\n\nChasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon\n\nChasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view\n\nYeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new\n\nStill chasing you, still chasing you\n\n\n\nYou always used to talk about LA\n\nI heard you got as far as Santa Fe\n\nOh wait, you know I tried to track you down\n\nI only got as far as Guitar Town\n\nSinging about a girl I used to know, used to know\n\nYou should know that I haven't given up\n\nI'm just on your radio\n\n\n\nChasing you like a shot of whiskey\n\nBurning going down, burning going down\n\nChasing you like those goodbye taillights\n\nHeading west to anywhere out of this no where town\n\nChasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon\n\nChasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view\n\nYeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new\n\nStill chasing you, still chasing you\n\n\n\nChasing you like a shot of whiskey\n\nBurning going down, burning going down\n\nChasing you like those good bye taillights\n\nHeading west to anywhere out of this no where town\n\nChasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon\n\nChasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view\n\nYeah I'm laying here tonight holding someone new\n\nStill chasing you, still chasing you\n\n\n\nStill chasing you, still chasing you"
