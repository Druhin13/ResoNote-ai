  "lyrics": "Just when I felt like giving up\r\nThat I shouldn't try\r\nTo save it now\r\nEasier lost outside of us\r\nThat's not what I find\n\nThis time around\n\n\n\nEvery night outside my window I pretend to catch the moon\n\nIt reminds me that there's always something more for me to prove\n\nI'm just waiting for the moment when you tell me that it's true\n\nI'm just waiting on a moment for you\n\n\n\nTo tell me how you feel\n\nAlways known for me, it's you\n\nSo give me something real\n\nAlways known for me, it's you\n\nIt's you\n\n\n\nStanding alone at 25\n\nI barely recognize\n\nMy own blue eyes\n\n\n\nI should've known, we'd make it right\n\nI'm coming back this time\n\nTo a different life\n\n\n\nWhere the lights outside my window flicker brighter than the moon\n\nLike a car chase in the valley, baby it's just me and you\n\nWhere we're living in the moment, when you tell me that it's true\n\nNow I'm right here in this moment with you\n\n\n\nSo tell me how you feel\n\nAlways known for me, it's you\n\nJust give me something real\n\nAlways known for me, it's you\n\nIt's you\n\n\n\nSo tell me how you feel\n\nAlways known for me, it's you\n\nJust give me something real\n\nAlways known for me, it's you\n\nIt's you"
