  "lyrics": "In the back of your car\r\nWe didn't get far that night\r\nBut I knew right then and there\r\nAs I was laying across your head\r\nThat the rest you can write in books\r\nAnd we'll build a home on the overlook\n\nAnd we came back a circle\n\nAnd let the black night point us north\n\n\n\nOnly a bride will I be\n\nOnly a bride will I see\n\nOnly a bride will I be\n\nOnly a bride\n\n\n\nIn the the bells of another town\n\nWith a fresh coat on the ground\n\nWhere we found a little cove to hide in\n\nInto the back of the car, again confiding\n\nAnd the snow grew up its blinks\n\nAnd we'll never falter like the frozen lakes\n\nAnd we came back a circle\n\nAnd let the black night point us north\n\n\n\nOnly a bride will I be\n\nOnly a bride will I see\n\nOnly a bride will I be\n\nOnly a bride\n\n\n\nOnly a bride will I be\n\nOnly a bride will I see\n\nOnly a bride will I be\n\nOnly a bride"
