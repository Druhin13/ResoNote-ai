  "lyrics": "This last week\r\nI slept 8 hours total, I barely sleep\r\nMaybe that's why I've been weak\r\nThe same things that plague you still plaguing me\r\nGod called you to fulfill a vacancy\r\nI tried to see why it wasn't me\n\n\n\nSo I didn't show up to your funeral\n\nBut I showed up to your house\n\nAnd I didn't move a muscle\n\nI was quiet as a mouse\n\nAnd I swore I saw you in there\n\nBut I was looking at myself\n\n\n\nI'm placing bets against myself\n\nAnd honestly I'm a mess\n\nWith the car engulfed in flames\n\nI am a wreck\n\nThings I should have said through call or text\n\nJust really been so busy and I regret\n\n\n\nCause if there's no rest for the wicked\n\nI'm as evil as it gets\n\nThing I should have said\n\n\n\nSo I didn't show up to your funeral\n\nBut I showed up to your house\n\nAnd I didn't move a muscle\n\nI was quiet as a mouse\n\nAnd I swore I saw you in there\n\nBut I was looking at myself\n\n\n\nSo when you show up to my funeral\n\nWill you be wearing white or black\n\nAnd I know the voice is in you\n\nIt's the energy I lack\n\nSo if there's a race to heaven\n\nI will surely come in last\n\nAnd if there's a race to heaven\n\nI will always come in last"
