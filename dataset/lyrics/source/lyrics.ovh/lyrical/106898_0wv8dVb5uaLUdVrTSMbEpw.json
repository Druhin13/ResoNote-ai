  "lyrics": "I think I smell the rain again\r\nI see the leaves getting dewy\r\nThey’re breathing\r\nFresh air awakens everything\r\nWhile the winds are barging through\n\nThey greet you\n\n\n\nOutside here\n\nLike any other morning\n\nLanding on cue\n\n\n\nI hear the drizzle coming down\n\nAnd then I realize in all of my life\n\nI don’t think that I remember it\n\nBeing so vivid\n\n\n\nOne, two, three, four\n\nFive, six miles away\n\nI wonder if they notice over there?\n\n\n\nUntil the light throws colors across the vista\n\nPiling so high they reach out of sight\n\nTo heaven"
