  "lyrics": "Stop and go\r\nDo I have a share in this?\r\nIt's as if I don't exist\r\nI look up to see the stars upon the face\n\nAnd I know the songs you like\n\nOr the space to make it right\n\nIt is life in slow-mo\n\nStop and go\n\n\n\nI've been lying in this room\n\nSummer breeze will take me soon\n\nIt's been time since Madeleine let me forget\n\n\n\nYour ignorant life\n\nCuts like a knife\n\nWhile tending to shops you adore\n\nThere's nothing inside\n\nGet dressed for the ride\n\nBut romance, a joke, and a war\n\nLook how easy we got fooled\n\nHow cheap they bought and sold us fools\n\nWish we could have become friends\n\nWith cops smoking their cigarettes\n\nThe stars, collide\n\nThey're for you and I\n\n\n\nWe made a plan but had no time\n\nMost of the girls made up their minds\n\nSomehow the boys knew they just had to wait in line\n\n\n\nI've been lying in this room\n\nSummer breeze will take me soon\n\nIt's been time since Madeleine let me forget\n\n\n\nYour ignorant life\n\nCuts like a knife\n\nWhile tending to shops you adore\n\nThere's nothing inside\n\nGet dressed for the ride\n\nBut romance, a joke, and a war\n\nLook how easy we got fooled\n\nHow cheap they bought and sold us fools\n\nWish we could have become friends\n\nWith cops smoking their cigarettes\n\n\n\nYour ignorant life\n\nCuts like a knife\n\nWhile tending to shops you adore\n\nThere's nothing inside\n\nGet dressed for the ride\n\nBut romance, a joke, and a war\n\nThe stars\n\nCollide\n\nThe stars, collide\n\nThey're for you and I"
