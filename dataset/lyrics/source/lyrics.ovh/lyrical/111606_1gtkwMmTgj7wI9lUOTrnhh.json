  "lyrics": "Everybody needs someone\r\nThat they're gonna believe in\r\nEverybody's the same\r\nAround the world\r\nIf you wanna find someone,\n\nThen you only have to show it\n\nNothin's sadder than love\n\nThat's left unheard\n\n\n\nMe, how I tried to deny\n\nThat it pointed to you\n\nToo many roads\n\nUp ahead lookin' shiny and new\n\n\n\nEverybody needs someone\n\nBut it's gotta mean something\n\nGiving up a piece of you's\n\nThe hardest part\n\n\n\nIf you wanna have someone\n\nThen you really got to know it\n\nDoesn't take very much\n\nTo break a heart\n\n\n\nMay I get lost in your eyes\n\nFor a lifetime or two?\n\nSomething about you and I\n\nLeads me right to the truth\n\n\n\nSome people always got something\n\nThey got left to say\n\nSome need to keep it inside\n\nThey just wanna hide away\n\n\n\nAnd I'm glad I have you there\n\n'Cause I would've been nowhere\n\nBein' here all alone's a lonely sound\n\nEverybody needs someone\n\nThat they're gonna believe in\n\nEverybody's the same\n\nAround the world"
