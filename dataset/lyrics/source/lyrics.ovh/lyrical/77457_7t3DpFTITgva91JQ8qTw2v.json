  "lyrics": "You gon' have to pull up without me\r\nMy demons, they got me down\r\nUsually it's not a problem\r\nI hoped they'd be gone by now\r\nTryna blow up, half full cup\r\nBut I'ma spill it all if you tell me pour up\n\nIn the middle of the club, lonely fuck\n\nTryna blow up but the club's not enough\n\n\n\nI'm not coming out tonight\n\nBut I'll be up, I'll be up 'til the sunrise\n\n\n\nTwenty-one years and counting\n\nOnly getting better with time\n\nPeople folding around me\n\nI am one of a kind\n\nIntrovert, call me hurt\n\nSwear it's a sign that the work don't work\n\nDeath don't flirt, black tee shirt\n\nI ain't tryna hide, let a bum nigga lurk\n\n\n\nI'm not coming out tonight\n\nBut I'll be up, I'll be up 'til the sunrise\n\n\n\nTalk just don't impress me\n\nDon't address me, don't you stress me, no\n\nLike I don't do what you're doin', do it better nigga\n\nI got no end for ya, talk just don't impress me\n\nDon't address me, don't you stress me, no\n\nLike I don't do what you're doin', do it better nigga\n\nI got no end for ya, I got no end for ya\n\nI got no end for ya\n\n\n\nI'm not coming out tonight\n\nBut I'll be up, I'll be up 'til the sunrise\n\n(I got no end for ya)\n\nI'm not coming out tonight\n\nBut I'll be up, I'll be up 'til the sunrise\n\n(I got no end for ya)\n\n\n\n(I got no end for ya)\n\n(I got no end for ya)"
