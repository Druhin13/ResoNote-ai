  "lyrics": "All my little plans and schemes\r\nLost like some forgotten dreams\r\nSeems like all I really was doing\r\nWas waiting for you\r\nJust like little girls and boys\n\nPlaying with their little toys\n\nSeems like all they really were doing\n\nWas waiting for love\n\n\n\nDon't need to be alone\n\nNo need to be alone\n\nIt's real love, it's real\n\nYes it's real love, it's real\n\n\n\nFrom this moment on I know\n\nExactly where my life will go\n\nSeems that all I really was doing\n\nWas waiting for love\n\n\n\nDon't need to be afraid\n\nNo need to be afraid\n\nIt's real love, it's real\n\nYes it's real love, it's real\n\n\n\nThought I'd been in love before\n\nBut in my heart, I wanted more\n\nSeems like all I really was doing\n\nWas waiting for you\n\n\n\nDon't need to be alone\n\nDon't need to be alone\n\n\n\nIt's real love, it's real\n\nIt's real love, it's real\n\nYes it's real love, it's real\n\nIt's real love, it's real\n\nYes it's real love, it's real\n\nIt's real love, it's real\n\nYes it's real love, it's real\n\nIt's real love, it's real"
