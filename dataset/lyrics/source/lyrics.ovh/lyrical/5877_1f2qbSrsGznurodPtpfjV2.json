  "lyrics": "Drawn from years of self denying\r\nLost in chaos before the storm\r\nOur strength goes on prepared for mortal battle\r\nWe can saddle our old scores\r\nLook to the skies and challenge all of heaven\n\nResist the devil, dare to dream\n\nBy grace of god within our hearts eternal\n\nFor our salvation is for everyone\n\n\n\nWe're standing as one\n\nWe're carrying on\n\nRising from ruins\n\nWe're bringing the light\n\nOut from the night\n\nRising from ruins\n\n\n\nWe'll face our foes so they can hear our voices\n\nThe land rejoices in empathy\n\nThis trial by fire will build from their attrition\n\nIt's ammunition for our enemies\n\n\n\nWe're standing as one\n\nWe're carrying on\n\nRising from ruins\n\nWe're bringing the light\n\nOut from the night\n\nRising from ruins\n\n\n\nSend in the valiant, fight for what you believe\n\nThen we shall overcome, lay victory at our feet\n\n\n\nWe're standing as one\n\nWe're carrying on\n\nRising from ruins\n\nWe bring the light\n\nOut from the night\n\nRising from ruins\n\n\n\nWe're standing as one\n\nWe're carrying on\n\nRising from ruins\n\nWe're bringing the light\n\nOut from the night\n\nRising from ruins"
