  "lyrics": "I spoke a vow today\r\nAnd asked if god would come and play\r\nI've dug a shallow hole for him to sleep\r\nBut I swear he just won't answer me\r\nI call on out is he afraid\r\nI'll bury him down with the ones he keeps\n\nAnd if the devil's listening\n\nI'll come for him as well\n\nIf I suspect he had a hand to play\n\nAnd if I see his face in town\n\nThere's room for two down underground\n\nNothing's gonna stop me 'til I'm done\n\n\n\nUntil I'm done!\n\nUntil I'm done!\n\nUntil I'm done!\n\nUntil I'm done!\n\n\n\nBecause tonight I'm killing gods!\n\nKilling gods!\n\n\n\nIt's guilt and frustration, it's everything between\n\nThe silence and the absence hitting home\n\nPeripheral glances and the chasing of a sound\n\nI never knew I'd miss until it's gone\n\nSo ask me how I'm coping\n\nAnd I'll smile and tell you \"I'm just fine\"\n\nWhile down inside I'm drowning in the fucking rain\n\n\n\nBecause when everything is empty\n\nAnd your heart is set to cave\n\nSometimes all you wish for\n\nIs a place, is a place to place the blame\n\n\n\nBurn your heaven\n\nFlood your hell\n\nDrown you in your wishing wells\n\nBurn your heaven\n\nFlood your hell\n\nDamn you all\n\nBecause tonight I'm killing gods!\n\n\n\nThe incendiary shock wave, scorched earth policy\n\nThe devastation that only loss will leave\n\nThe chants and incantations of daily rituals\n\nA subtle lapse in brutal honesty\n\nSo ask me how I'm coping\n\nAnd I'll smile and tell you \"I'm just fine\"\n\nWhile down inside I'm screaming 'til I fucking bleed\n\n\n\nBecause when everyone's expendable\n\nAnd your heart can't take the wait\n\nThe last thing that you wish for\n\nIs the face, is the face to face the pain\n\n\n\nBurn your heaven\n\nFlood your hell\n\nDrown you in your wishing wells\n\nBurn your heaven\n\nFlood your hell\n\nDamn you all\n\nBecause tonight I'm killing gods\n\n\n\nI spoke a vow today\n\nAnd asked if god would come and play\n\n'Cause I just want to cut that fucker down\n\n\n\nFace me\n\nFace me\n\nFace me\n\nFace me\n\n\n\nFace me!\n\nFace me!\n\nNone survive!\n\nFace me!\n\nFace me!\n\nNone survive!\n\n\n\nNone survive!\n\n\n\nThe devil and god have died inside me!"
