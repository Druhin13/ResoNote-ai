  "lyrics": "Smiles in the morning at me\r\nApartment on the second story\r\nStrangers in a brand new city\r\nBoth remembering last night\r\nKitchen table and a bottle of wine\r\nThe only thing on my mind is you\n\n\n\nThe way the moonlight flickered in\n\nWe were stars of some old classic film\n\n\n\nWith Miss Simone\n\nSinging, \"Pour some sugar in my bowl, baby\"\n\nIn the glow of the candlelight, we danced all night\n\nOn the rooftop, thinking no one needs to know a thing\n\nBut Miss Simone\n\nNo one but Miss Simone\n\n\n\nMoving boxes cover the floor\n\nI've never quite been here before\n\nFinally made a house feel like home\n\nThe years are flying past us now\n\nYou and I have figured out how\n\nTo conjure up a feeling so true\n\n\n\nClose the door and set the day down\n\nSettle in, and we'll throw on some\n\n\n\nMiss Simone\n\nSinging, \"Pour some sugar in my bowl, baby\"\n\nIn the glow of the candlelight, we can dance all night\n\nOn the rooftop, thinking no one needs to know a thing\n\nBut Miss Simone\n\nNo one but Miss Simone\n\n\n\nHow'd she know what a heart sounds like\n\nIn the glow of this candle on a rooftop in the moonlight?\n\n\n\nSomeday when we're old and gray\n\nSifting through our yesterdays\n\nWe'll pull that memory from its sleeve\n\nAnd play that song of you and me\n\n\n\nAnd Miss Simone\n\nSinging, \"Pour some sugar in my bowl, baby\"\n\nIn the glow of the candlelight, we will dance all night\n\nOn the rooftop, thinking no one needs to know a thing\n\nBut Miss Simone\n\nNo one but Miss Simone\n\n\n\nMmh, mmh"
