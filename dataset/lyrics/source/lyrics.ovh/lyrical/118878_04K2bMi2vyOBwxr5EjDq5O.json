Dreams are normal too. Going to bed at a regular time each night makes it easier to go right off to sleep\r\nRest your head, here's a lullaby\r\nA melody for heavy eyes\r\nEarly to bed, early to die\r\nWelcome to your worst nightmare\n\n\n\n\n\nFast asleep, it's all in your head now\n\nPast the street where they cursed my name\n\nBut I won't be forsaken\n\nCraven my revenge from the shallow grave\n\nWhere I went down in flames\n\nThe beast has been awakened\n\n\n\nWhen night comes creeping\n\nMy cruel hand will rock you to sleep\n\n\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nWith American dreams\n\nOf countin' the bodies while you count sheep\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nYeah, I'm living' the dream\n\nI'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream\n\nSweet dreams\n\n\n\nFell in love with hate cause evil fit like a glove\n\nIt's fate that I'm still here\n\nAnd I won't be forsaken\n\nWicked when I was just a man\n\nBut sickening now and fed by fear\n\nThe beast has been awakened now\n\nThey all think it's just pretend\n\nYou'll never ever sleep again\n\nAll your friends are fucking dead\n\nYou can't turn down your own deathbed\n\n\n\nWhen night comes creeping\n\nMy cruel hand will rock you to sleep\n\n\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nWith American dreams\n\nOf countin' the bodies while you count sheep\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nYeah, I'm living the dream\n\nI'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nI'm the man of the dreams\n\nWhere the glove is God\n\nSo I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream\n\n\n\nOne, two, dreams do come true\n\nThree, four, see you at the morgue\n\nFive, six, he'll get his fix\n\nSeven, eight, now shake the twisted hand of fate\n\nNo!\n\nNow shake the twisted hand of fate\n\nNo!\n\nAll your friends are fucking dead\n\n\n\nWhen night comes creeping\n\nMy cruel hand will rock you to sleep\n\n\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nWith American dreams\n\nOf countin' the bodies while you count sheep\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nYeah, I'm living the dream\n\nI'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream\n\nI'm the American nightmare\n\nI'm the man of your dreams\n\nNow the cloth is cut\n\nSo I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream"
