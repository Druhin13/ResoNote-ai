  "lyrics": "I feel like Atlas\r\nI got my back stretched\r\nYou wanna grab this\r\nYou don't understand this\r\nI keep it oppressed\r\nWork on my realness\n\nReading my manifest\n\nI'll address your request\n\n\n\nI've been waking up drenched in sweat\n\nAll my dreams, full of my regret (my regret)\n\nI keep hearing what my mother said\n\nEyes are open, all I see is red\n\n\n\nI met you in California\n\nYou told me you loved him in Georgia\n\nYour heart's in the ground frozen over\n\nMy heart's in the sky supernova\n\nI met you in California\n\nYou told me you loved him in Georgia\n\nYour heart's in the ground frozen over\n\nMy heart's in the sky supernova\n\n\n\nLook overhead at the stars, and the ocean\n\nFoggy emotions, moments, erosion\n\nThis supernova could cause a comotion\n\nMy minds of the notion you'll still be my motive\n\nI've been, I've been so fucked in my head\n\nI've been going through phases\n\nI'm just going through phases\n\nDon't know what this craze is\n\nWhen's the last time someone said shit? (ohhh)\n\nWalking through your mazes\n\nWhen's the last time someone meant it? (ohhh)\n\n\n\nI've been waking up drenched in sweat\n\nAll my dreams full of my regret (my regret)\n\nI keep hearing what my mother said\n\nEyes are open all I see is red\n\n\n\nI met you in California\n\nYou told me you loved him in Georgia\n\nYour heart's in the ground frozen over\n\nMy heart's in the sky supernova\n\nI met you in California\n\nYou told me you loved him in Georgia\n\nYour heart's in the ground frozen over\n\nMy heart's in the sky supernova"
