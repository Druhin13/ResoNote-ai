  "lyrics": "My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley\r\nLike a long ago Sunday when I walked through the alley\r\nOn a cold winter's morning to a church house\r\njust to shovel some snow.\r\nI heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin' nuder,\n\nAn altar boy's been hit by a local commuter\n\njust from walking with his back turned\n\nto the train that was coming so slow.\n\n\n\nYou can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,\n\nthrow your hands in the air, say \"What does it matter?\"\n\nbut it don't do no good to get angry,\n\nso help me I know \n\n\n\nFor a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.\n\nYou become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there\n\nwrapped up in a trap of your very own\n\nchain of sorrow.\n\n\n\nI been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there.\n\nI sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair\n\nand my head shouted down to my heart\n\n\"You better look out below!\"\n\n\n\nHey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter\n\nfrom the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter\n\nand you carry those bruises\n\nto remind you wherever you go."
