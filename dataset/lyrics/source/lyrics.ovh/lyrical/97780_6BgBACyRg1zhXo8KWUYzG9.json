  "lyrics": "You say you'll be down in 5\r\nThe smell of your perfume \nIs floating down the stairs\r\nYou're fixing up your hair like you do\r\nI know that I'll be a mess\r\nThe second that I see you\n\nYou won't be surprised\n\nIt happens every time, it's nothing new\n\n\n\nIt's always on a night like tonight\n\nI think that you can read my mind\n\n'Cause when you look at me with those eyes\n\n\n\nI'm speechless\n\nStaring at you, standing there in that dress\n\nWhat it's doing to me, ain't a secret\n\n'Cause watching you is all that I can do\n\nAnd I'm speechless\n\nYou already know that you're my weakness\n\nAfter all this time I'm just as nervous\n\nEvery time you walk into the room\n\nI'm speechless\n\n\n\nIt started when you said hello\n\nJust did something to me\n\nAnd I've been in a daze\n\nEver since the day that we met\n\nYou take the breath out of my lungs\n\nI can't even fight it\n\nAnd all of the words out of my mouth \n\nWithout even trying\n\n\n\nAnd I'm speechless\n\nStaring at you, standing there in that dress\n\nWhat it's doing to me, ain't a secret\n\n'Cause watching you is all that I can do\n\nAnd I'm speechless\n\nYou already know that you're my weakness\n\nAfter all this time I'm just as nervous\n\nEvery time you walk into the room\n\nI'm speechless (yeah babe hmmm)\n\n\n\nIt's always on a night like tonight\n\nI think that you can read my mind\n\n'Cause when you look at me with those eyes\n\n\n\nI'm speechless\n\nStanding there in that dress\n\nGirl it ain't a secret\n\n'Cause watching you is all that I can do, oooh\n\nI'm speechless\n\nYou already know that you're my weakness\n\nAfter all this time I'm just as nervous\n\nEvery time you walk into the room\n\nI'm speechless\n\n\n\nOh, you know it, baby"
