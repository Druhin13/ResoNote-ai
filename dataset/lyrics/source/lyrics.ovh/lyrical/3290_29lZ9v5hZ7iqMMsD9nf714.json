  "lyrics": "Well, shall we just go little wreck of my heart\r\nGo for the waves out there?\r\nOh, I know\r\nThese are frightening seas\r\nWhen old bastards are ripping apart\r\nAll what is kind out there\n\nAll we grow\n\nAnd how wild we dream\n\n\n\nOh, somewhere in this stubborn light\n\nOver the waves and troubles now\n\nI look out for yours like you'll for mine\n\nSo deep in the arms of the ocean now, mmm\n\nWhen the bird sees the solid ground, mmm\n\n\n\nAnd now we leeway when still and so dark\n\nPeace in the waves out here\n\nThunder claps\n\nIn the distance warm\n\nAnother one follows I count from afar\n\nOh, I never get used to this\n\nFirst the flare\n\nThen the silence starts\n\n\n\nOh, somewhere in this stubborn light\n\nOver our waves and troubles now\n\nI look out for yours like you'll for mine\n\nSo deep in the arms of the ocean now, mmm\n\nWhen the bird sees the solid ground, mmm\n\n\n\nI've been counting on\n\nThe wind would know where I'm going to\n\nOh, when stillness comes around\n\nI'll ask what my heart would do\n\nAbout drifting around\n\nSo deep in the arms of some ocean now, mmm\n\n\n\nI see feathers on every wave\n\nFrom every old used to be\n\nOnes you loved\n\nDid you let them dream?\n\nI still lose it, I speak to myself\n\nOh, I ask out in nothing too\n\nTo the birds, why I'm singing still, am I singing still?\n\nMmm"
