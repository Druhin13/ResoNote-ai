  "lyrics": "I heard of a river flowing from heaven\r\nAnd all who are thirsty would thirst no more\r\nI wonder if I can drink of this fountain\r\nThe least of ten thousand I come\r\nHere at the waterfall, I stand in awe\n\nUnder the rock, under the rock where mercy reigns\n\nHere at the waterfall, beneath the cross\n\nUnder the rock, under the rock where mercy reigns\n\n\n\nI heard of a river out of the mountain\n\nWhere healing and pardon are pouring out\n\nI'm over my head in a sea of forgiveness\n\nHidden in Jesus I am found\n\n\n\nHere at the waterfall, I stand in awe\n\nUnder the rock, under the rock where mercy reigns\n\nHere at the waterfall, beneath the cross\n\nUnder the rock, under the rock where mercy reigns\n\n\n\nAnd everything lives where the river runs\n\nEverything lives where the river runs\n\nEverything lives where the river runs\n\nEverything lives where the river runs, yeah\n\nAnd everything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive, I come alive\n\n'Cause everything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive, I come alive\n\nEverything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive, I come alive\n\nYes, everything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive\n\n\n\nHere at the waterfall, I stand in awe, yes\n\nUnder the rock, under the rock where mercy reigns\n\nHere at the waterfall, beneath the cross\n\nUnder the rock, under the rock where mercy reigns, yes\n\n\n\nEverything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive, I come alive\n\nAnd everything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive, I come alive\n\nEverything lives where the river runs\n\nI come alive"
