  "lyrics": "Mmm, mmm\r\nMmm, yeah\r\nYou go searching for paradise\r\nYou sit back and close your eyes\r\nWe're burning, yet so alive\n\nAnd now you've got your hands up\n\nHoping you catch the high\n\nFeels like the summer time\n\nChasing the northern lights, oh\n\nDon'd like watching your momma cry\n\nYou say you'd rather die\n\nShe says you're wasting your life\n\n\n\nOh, life don’t stop the more we pray\n\nAll your wrongs from yesterday\n\nSmokin’ himalayan haze\n\nWon’t wash all your sins away\n\n\n\nHate don’t give\n\nLove don’t rewind all the good times\n\nAll the dollars you’ll spend\n\nGive it up for nights like this\n\nDon’t give into overthinking\n\nPour a drink when it ends\n\n\n\nDo you hear me through your speakers\n\nSo much distance, space between us\n\nSay you're dreaming and I’ve been, too\n\nAnd no-one knows what you’ve been through\n\nAnd I've been thinking a little deeper\n\nContemplation, getting cleaner\n\nSee no leaders, need more teachers\n\nI'm in shambles, I don't sleep much\n\n\n\nOh, life don’t stop the more we pray\n\nAll your wrongs from yesterday\n\nSmokin’ himalayan haze\n\nWon’t wash all your sins away\n\n\n\nHate don’t give\n\nLove don’t rewind all the good times\n\nAll the dollars you’ll spend\n\nGive it up for nights like this\n\nDon’t give into overthinking\n\nPour a drink when it ends (Overthink)\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah"
