  "lyrics": "He was born the fall of '58\r\nMade a fortune selling real estate\r\nGolden lions waited at the gate\r\nHe was lonely, but it all looked great\r\nNever made time for the family\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nOnly made time for the company\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nHe is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\n\n\nCut from diamonds, but he came from dust\n\nBuilt a kingdom out of salt and blood\n\nOwned a city, never saw the streets\n\nOr the people that he'd never meet\n\n\n\nWarm blood, cold heart\n\nYeah, he's all alone\n\nHe had it all, but it couldn't buy love\n\nYeah, he died alone\n\n\n\nNever made time for the family\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nOnly made time for the company\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nHe is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\n\n\nNever made time for the family\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nOnly made time for the company\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nHe is the richest man in the cemetery\n\nBut he is the richest man in the cemetery"
