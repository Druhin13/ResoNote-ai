  "lyrics": "Miles Davis walked off the stage\r\nThat's what the folks are all saying\r\nOh yes, he did leave the stage\r\nAfter his solo was all over\r\nColtrane he walked off the stage\n\nThat's what the folks are all saying\n\nYes, they both left the stage\n\nClean out of sight\n\n\n\nThey felt they had to rehearse\n\nAlthough we know they are masters\n\nThey get a real groovy sound\n\nAnd you will have to admit it\n\n\n\nYes, they both left the stage\n\nSoon as their solo's were over\n\nAnd if you can't figure out\n\nTheir groove, I'd like to help you\n\nTheir groove, I've helped you\n\n\n\nSo what"
