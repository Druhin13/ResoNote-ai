  "lyrics": "Don't know what to say to you now\r\nStanding right in front of you\r\nDon't know how to fade in and out\r\nDon't know how to play it cool\r\nLosing a little guard, let it down\r\nWe don't have to think it through\n\nWe've got to let go\n\n\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\nThe kind that never slows down\n\nI wanna take you high up\n\nLet our hearts be the only sound\n\nI wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\n\n\nTried to call you, to feel you close\n\nFrom a runway in Tokyo\n\nLet's leave the atmosphere, disappear\n\nThere's always something left to loose\n\n\n\nBut I wanna give you wild love\n\nThe kind that never slows down\n\nI wanna take you high up\n\nLet our hearts be the only sound\n\nI wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\n\n\n(I wanna give you wild love)\n\n(I wanna give you wild love)\n\nLet's be reckless, unaffected\n\nRunning out until we're breathless\n\nLet's be hopeful, don't get broken\n\nAnd stay caught up in the moment\n\n\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\nThe kind that never slows down\n\nI wanna take you high up\n\nLet our hearts be the only sound\n\nI wanna go where the lights burn low and you're only mine\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\nI wanna give you wild love\n\n\n\nGive you wild love\n\nWild love\n\nWild love\n\nWild love"
