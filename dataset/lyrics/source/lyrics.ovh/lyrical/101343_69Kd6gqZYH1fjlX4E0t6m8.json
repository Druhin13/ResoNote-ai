  "lyrics": "The truth in front of my eyes\r\nAlong with all these desperate lies\r\nFade away like they're old memories\r\nThe warmth of someone's love, I have no feeling of\r\nAll those things I don't know anymore\n\nYou told me when you left me, that I'd be fine all on my own\n\nFrom your lips, you spoke one last goodbye\n\nThat look of sympathy it's nothing new to me\n\nYou would think by now it wouldn't faze me\n\n\n\nMerciless memories\n\nThey're ringing out so unforgivingly\n\nThey show no intent of letting me go free\n\nAnd if I close my eyes, and try to draw them out they only grow\n\nThey're closing in and far away you laugh\n\n\n\nWill the rain falling down ever find an ending?\n\nAll this time I've been waiting in the freezing cold\n\nWill the rain ever leave me alone, I wonder what it shows\n\nTo follow me when there's nowhere else I can go\n\n\n\nThis fleeting breaking morning, I wish would last a moment more\n\nBut again, time isn't on my side\n\nI'm realizing, at last, I've been chasing the past\n\nI've been heading in the wrong direction\n\n\n\nYou tried to give me your hand so I could start again as best I can\n\nBut I was a fool and couldn't turn to you\n\nSo far I held you back, but any moment now I know I'd crack\n\nFor all my pain is pouring down my face\n\n\n\nEyes like yours\n\nDon't wanna know about a past like mine\n\nHands like yours\n\nGently brush away the tears I cry\n\nBut these scars, I know they'll only heal if I give them time\n\nThat distant future no longer seems far away\n\n\n\nWill the rain falling down ever find an ending?\n\nAll this time, I've been waiting in the freezing cold\n\nWill the rain ever leave me alone, I wonder what it shows\n\nTo swallow me and to take me home\n\n\n\nThese storms are into another day it's pouring on\n\nAnd I watch, knowing that there is no end in sight\n\nHere we stand hand in hand now as we look out on the world\n\nJust one umbrella to keep us dry from the storm"
