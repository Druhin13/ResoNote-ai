  "title": "Intro",
  "lyrics": "It felt like birth\r\nWe had a careful, meticulous hopeful love, that led to a hard labor Ignited by heartbreak\r\nIt felt like birth the way I cried\r\nIn the cold I felt naked and exposed\r\nAwake, alone\r\nConfused, uncomfortable and incapable of simply breathing\n\nPainful and beautiful at the same time\n\nAnd when I grew, when I found myself\n\nI learned I existed still\n\nI realized that after all...\n\nThere is life after love"
