  "lyrics": "I just want a life that seems a little better than a dream\r\nBut I just can't seem to get on my feet\r\nSo I gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go\r\nI hope someday that you will know\r\nI sit back and think about the life I've had\n\nSo much to change, but I can't go back\n\nWhat happened to that kid? He used to play in the street\n\nI think about that kid, he looked just like me\n\nHad a smile, had a home, never grow old\n\nWhen we grow up, do we have to grow cold?\n\nSpent his whole life looking for salvation\n\nNever realized nobody could save him\n\nSo all these words, for what they're worth\n\nI know it's hard, I know it hurts\n\nAnd we laugh at the past 'cause it's how we learn\n\nWelcome to the world, now let's watch it burn\n\n\n\nI just want a life that seems a little better than a dream\n\nBut I just can't seem to get on my feet\n\nSo I gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go\n\nI hope someday that you will know\n\nYou gotta let go, gotta let go\n\nI hope someday you'll understand\n\n\n\nSometimes I sit and wish that I could see\n\nA future picture of an older me\n\nWould he be smiling and would he be happy?\n\nWould he say a thousand words while looking right at me?\n\nIs he different or the same old me?\n\nIs he still chasing after these same old dreams?\n\nI know that I'll never reach perfection\n\nAt least he could point me in the right direction\n\nSome grow old, and some grow cold\n\nThey'd sell their souls for a heart of gold\n\nGod only knows where the hell would I be\n\nIf I had the old me sitting beside me\n\n\n\nI just want a life that seems a little better than a dream\n\nBut I just can't seem to get on my feet\n\nSo I gotta let go, gotta let go, gotta let go\n\nI hope someday that you will know\n\nYou gotta let go, gotta let go\n\nI hope someday you'll understand\n\n\n\nNo one knows what it's like to be alone\n\nPlease, tell me, is anyone out there?\n\nNo one knows what it's like to be alone\n\nPlease, tell me, is anyone out there?\n\n\n\nI just want a life that seems a little better than a dream"
