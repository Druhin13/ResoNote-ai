  "lyrics": "I got a friend in Fremont, He sells used cars, ya know.\r\nWell, he calls me up twice a year\r\nJust ask me how'd it go\r\nPretty good, not bad, I can't complain\r\nActually everything is just about the same\n\nI met a girl from Venus, and her insides were lined in gold\n\nWell, she did what she did said \"How was it, kid?\"\n\nShe was politely told\n\n\"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain\n\nBut actually everything is just about the same.\"\n\n\n\nMoonlight makes me dizzy\n\nSunlight makes me clean\n\nYour light is the sweetest thing\n\nThat this boy has ever seen.\n\n\n\nMolly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog\n\nWell, she was doing good till she went in the woods\n\nAnd got pinned up against a log\n\nPretty good, not bad, she can't complain\n\nCause actually all them dogs is just about the same\n\n\n\nMoonlight makes me dizzy\n\nSunlight makes me clean\n\nYour light is the sweetest thing\n\nThat this boy has ever seen.\n\n\n\n\n\nI heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast\n\nAnd up the sky and Arabian rabbi\n\nFed Quaker oats to a priest.\n\nPretty good, not bad, they can't complain\n\nCause actually all them gods is just about the same\n\nPretty good, not bad, I can't complain\n\nCause actually everything is just about the same"
