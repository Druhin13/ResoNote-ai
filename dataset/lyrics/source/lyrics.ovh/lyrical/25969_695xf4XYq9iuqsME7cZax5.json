  "lyrics": "You don't like the sound of the truth\r\nComing from my mouth\r\nYou say that I lack the proof\r\nWell baby that might be so\r\nI might get to the end of my life\r\nFind out everyone was lying\n\nI don't think that I'm afraid anymore say that I would rather die trying\n\n\n\nWoh-oh\n\nSwing me way down south\n\nSing me something brave from your mouth\n\nAnd I'll bring you\n\nPearls of water on my hips\n\nAnd the love in my lips\n\nAll the love from my lips\n\n\n\nThis time when he swung the bat\n\nAnd I found myself laying flat I wondered\n\nWhat a way to spend a dime\n\nWhat a way to use the time, ain't it baby\n\nI looked at my reflection in the window walking past\n\nAnd I saw a stranger\n\nJust so scared all the time it makes me one more reason\n\nWhy the world's dangerous\n\n\n\nWoh-oh\n\nSwing me way down south\n\nSing me something brave from your mouth\n\nAnd I'll bring you\n\nPearls of water on my hips\n\nAnd the love in my lips\n\nAll the love from my lips\n\n\n\nYou don't like the sound of the truth\n\nComing from my mouth\n\nYou say that I lack the proof\n\nWell baby that might be so\n\nTell me what's wrong with having a little faith\n\nIn what you're feeling in your heart\n\nWhy must we be so afraid\n\nAnd always so far apart\n\n\n\nWoh-oh\n\nSwing me way down south\n\nSing me something brave from your mouth\n\nAnd I'll bring you\n\nPearls of water on my hips\n\nAnd the love in my lips\n\nAll the love from my lips"
