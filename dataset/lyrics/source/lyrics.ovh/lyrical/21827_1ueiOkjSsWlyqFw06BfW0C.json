  "lyrics": "Sway, sway in all your fancy clothes\r\nNobody knows you but everyone knows\r\nStay, stay inside with the ghosts\r\nSome nights I swear I just want to go home\r\nCan you believe the ceiling’s made of leaves?\n\nAnd nobody beneath us knows of anything we’ve seen\n\nCan you believe the ceiling’s made of leaves?\n\nWhere do you go now you know?\n\n\n\nSway, sway knee deep in the stream\n\nBreak down at the very sight of me\n\nI crossed my heart and prayed to God to never leave me be he said\n\nSave your breath and just breathe\n\n\n\nCan you believe the ceiling’s made of leaves?\n\nAnd nobody beneath us knows of anything we’ve seen\n\nCan you believe the ceiling’s made of leaves?\n\nBut where do you go when you know\n\nWhen you know that you’re wrong\n\nBut you know that it helps\n\n\n\nI know I’m not the only one to poison myself\n\nBut I poison myself\n\nAnd I poison myself\n\nAnd I poison myself"
