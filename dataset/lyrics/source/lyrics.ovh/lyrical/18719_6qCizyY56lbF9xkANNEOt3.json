  "lyrics": "Hangin' out with the scarecrow blues\r\nOn the other side of being used\r\nThe whine and the whistle of a passing train\r\nSounds so heavy when it says your name\r\nBaby when you're down, baby when you're way down\r\nLost your shine and your feet are cold\n\nYou don't have to stay down, you don't have to stay down\n\nYou're like silver, you're like gold\n\nYou're like silver, you're like gold\n\nWind caught up in the weather vane\n\nSoaked to the bone from a summer rain\n\nI'll be right here to see you through\n\nThe dust and the rust and the scarecrow blues\n\nBaby when you're down, baby when you're way down\n\nLost your shine and your feet are cold\n\nYou don't have to stay down, you don't have to stay down\n\nYou're like silver, you're like gold\n\nYou're like silver, you're like gold\n\nBaby when you're down, baby when you're way down\n\nLost your shine and your feet are cold\n\nYou don't have to stay down, you don't have to stay down\n\nYou're like silver, you're like gold\n\nYou're like silver, you're like gold"
