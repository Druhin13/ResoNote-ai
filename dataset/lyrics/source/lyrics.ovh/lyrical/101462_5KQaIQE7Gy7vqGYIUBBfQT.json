  "lyrics": "From the seventh floor window sometimes I swear I see it all\r\nWhich way the wind blows to have it all bound to fall\r\nIt doesn't make much sense, the crazy things I do\r\nUnder the influence of the pain that I've been through\r\nTo get to you\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\n\n\nI shook cans with deception when I saw through their empty eyes\n\nI broke bread with the burdens of everything that I despise\n\nDug my own graves and I've thrown caution to the wind\n\nBecome a slave to awaken ways of man\n\n\n\nTo get to you\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\n\n\nI wish I haven't waged the wars, I'm witness of my fears\n\nBut it was worth the wait just to be standing here\n\nSinging to the heavens and stay [?] on my mind\n\nStanding on the seventh floor of everything I left behind\n\nTo get to you\n\n\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\n\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\n\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\nIt's what I do\n\nTo get to you\n\n\n\nFrom the seventh floor window sometimes I swear I see it all\n\nWhich way the wind blows to have it all bound to fall"
