  "lyrics": "If tomorrow is judgement day (sing mommy)\r\nAnd I'm standin' on the front line.\r\nAnd the Lord ask me what I did with my life.\r\nI will say I spent it with you.\r\nIf I wake up in the World War III.\n\nI see destruction and poverty.\n\nAnd I feel like I want to go home.\n\nIt's okay if you're coming with me.\n\n\n\nChorus: \n\n\n\nCause your love is my love.\n\nand my love is your love.\n\nIt would take an eternity to break us.\n\nAnd the chains of Amistad couln't hold us.\n\n\n\nIf I lose my fame and fortune.\n\nAnd I'm homeless on the street.\n\nAnd I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station.\n\nIt's okay if you're sleepin' with me.\n\n\n\nAs the years they pass us by.\n\nwe stay young through each other's eyes.\n\nAnd no matter how old we get.\n\nIt's okay as long as I got you babe.\n\n\n\n(Chorus) \n\n\n\nIf I should die this very day.\n\nDon't cry, cause on earth we wasn't meant to stay.\n\nAnd no matter what people say.\n\nI'll be waiting for you after judgement day.\n\n\n\n(Chorus)"
