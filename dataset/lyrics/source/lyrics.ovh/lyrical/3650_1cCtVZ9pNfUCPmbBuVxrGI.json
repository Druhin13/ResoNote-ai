  "lyrics": "Love, love changes everything;\r\nHands and faces, earth and sky\r\nLove, love changes everything;\r\nHow you live and how you die\r\nLove can make the summer fly\r\nOr a night seem like a lifetime\n\nYes, love, love changes everything\n\nNow I tremble at your name\n\nNothing in this world will ever be the same\n\n\n\nLove, love changes everything;\n\nDays are longer, words mean more\n\nLove, love changes everything;\n\nPain is deeper than before\n\nLove will turn your world around\n\nAnd that world will last forever\n\nYes, love, love changes everything;\n\nBrings you glory, brings you shame\n\nNothing in this world will ever be the same\n\n\n\nLove, love changes everything;\n\nPlanning futures, shaping years\n\nLove bursts in and suddenly\n\nAll our wisdom disappears\n\nLove makes fools of everyone;\n\nAll the rules we made are broken\n\nYes, love, love changes everyone;\n\nLive or perish, in its flame\n\nLove will never, never let you be the same\n\nLove will never, never let you be the same"
