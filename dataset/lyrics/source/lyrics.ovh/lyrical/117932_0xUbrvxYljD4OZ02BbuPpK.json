  "lyrics": "We roam tundras\r\nThe boy been gone a few summers too long from road runnin'\r\nTrunk full of old hunnids\r\nOf course my old lover was scorned, we grow from it\r\nDon't tell me they don't hunt us for sport, I chose substances\n\nNo cuddles, the bases is all covered\n\nNiggas come in the door and smoke somethin'\n\nChoke up on the slugger from home run-ins\n\nNigga it's on, chest thump, his head thump on the floor\n\nWe pressed up on the boy, no more bluffin'\n\nCold summers, don't tussle with strangers\n\nSome of those keep one in the chamber\n\nThree spliffs had my wing tips clipped, I was stuck in a hangar, nigga\n\nMuffle my pain and muzzle my brain up\n\nReally, I'm just makin' sure my promise is kept\n\nChuck a duece if you know it's the end\n\nKept the truth in my palm and my chest\n\nSee it through, keep a noose hangin' off of my neck\n\nWe got the juice, niggas corny as shit\n\nWe on the loose, niggas know what it is\n\nWe makin' moves, niggas corny as shit\n\nWe got the juice, niggas know what it is\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nIt is night and like the others I clean my weapons\n\nIt is all so familiar"
