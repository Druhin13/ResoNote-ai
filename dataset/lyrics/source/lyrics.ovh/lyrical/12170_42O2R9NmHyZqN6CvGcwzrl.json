  "lyrics": "Fire in my eyes\r\nYou feel the heat on your skin\r\nYou wanna take me to the bankside\r\nTry to wash away my sin\r\nI wanna know\r\nWhere you think you goin' with my soul?\n\nI wanna know\n\nHow you gonna save me\n\nYou've been on my case sayin' \"I need a change\"\n\nSo twisted up inside about my wicked ways\n\nYou say I'm wild, I say that I'm runnin' free\n\nYou think I'm dyin' and I need\n\nI need you to save me\n\nSay I'm livin' my life like a train through the night\n\nYou don't think I'm gonna make it to see the next sunrise\n\nYou say I'm tortured, only you can set me free\n\nSay, I'm dyin' and I need\n\nI need you to save me\n\nYou wanna take me down to the river\n\nWanna put my head in the water\n\nSay, I'm livin' the life of a sinner\n\nI need someone...\n\nYou've got to peel back the skin\n\nHave to take off the mask\n\nFor the reasons I won't tell you\n\nAnd I never thought you'd ask\n\nI want to know\n\nHow you gonna save me?"
