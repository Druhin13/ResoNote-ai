  "lyrics": "Crosses in the distance bells ring fast\r\nLoveless in our shelter time will pass\r\nWould you take a chance on us?\r\nCould you take a chance on us?\r\nCall out to the lonely with regrets\n\nLoveless is your answer time will pass\n\nCouldn’t take a chance on us\n\nCouldn’t take a chance on us\n\n\n\nTake my hand\n\nIn belief we trace our steps\n\nUnderstand\n\nNo relief in silhouettes\n\n\n\nBattled myself so many times\n\nWhat I was isn’t what I want now\n\nWe can seek denial and search for miles\n\n\n\nBlessed love the love I need\n\nRolling drums the loveless bleed\n\n\n\nTake my hand\n\nIn belief we trace our steps\n\nUnderstand\n\nNo relief in silhouettes"
