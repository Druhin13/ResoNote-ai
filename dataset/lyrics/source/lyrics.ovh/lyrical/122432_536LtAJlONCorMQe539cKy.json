  "lyrics": "Hey, turn the light on\r\n'Cause I've got no one to show me the way\r\nPlease, I will follow\r\n'Cause you're my last hope, I'll do anything you say\r\nAnd I tried it my way\r\nEpic fails save me from myself\n\nSo, bite my hands now\n\nShut my mouth down I will listen, listen well\n\n\n\nSo teach me\n\nShow me all you've got\n\nAnd in your words, I will be wrapped up\n\nSpeak to me\n\nYou're my last hope\n\nAnd I will say nothing and listen to your love\n\n\n\nAnd I'm so lucky to be with you\n\nKeeping me from my shadow\n\nI know I would have been torn to shreds\n\nBy all the people in my head\n\n\n\nI, I let one tear fall\n\nAnd I crumble like the Berlin Wall\n\nOh, here something's broken\n\nZip me open, unlock the damaged door\n\n\n\nSo teach me\n\nShow me all you've got\n\nAnd in your words, I will be wrapped up\n\nSpeak to me\n\nYou're my last hope\n\nAnd I will say nothing and listen to your love\n\n\n\nBut I never shut up long enough to hear you\n\nAnd you never heard me by shutting me down\n\nBut look at what I mean, mean, mean\n\nZip me up now\n\nI will not speak, I will not speak\n\nYou showed me how\n\n\n\nSo teach me\n\nShow me all you've got\n\nAnd in your words, I will be wrapped up\n\nSpeak to me\n\nYou're my last hope\n\nAnd I will say nothing and listen to your love\n\n\n\nAnd I'm so lucky to be with you\n\nKeeping me from my shadow\n\nI know I would have been torn to shreds\n\nBy all the people in my head"
