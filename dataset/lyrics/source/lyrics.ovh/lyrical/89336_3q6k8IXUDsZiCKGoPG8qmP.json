  "lyrics": "I don't like to admit\r\nWhen I'm wrong and need gifts\r\nOf forgiveness instead of applause\r\nI was dying to prove to myself\r\nI could make it alone\r\nIt took years to confess\n\nThat your love was the best\n\nAt unraveling all of my pride\n\nHad to laugh at myself\n\nWhen I realized that you were my home\n\n\n\nGive me the strength to let go\n\nGive me the strength to surrender\n\nGive me the strength to stop holding on\n\nI've been holding on so long\n\nGive me the strength to let go\n\nAnd show me the way to come home\n\n\n\nYeah I'm stubborn and bold\n\nBut sometimes it gets old\n\nFighting voices inside of my brain\n\nI was trying to pretend I was fine\n\nWhen inside it was war\n\nWith the stumbling beat\n\nOf my heart and my feet\n\nAnd the faults of my failure and pain\n\nTo think all of this time\n\nI had wings that were ready to soar\n\n\n\nGive me the strength to let go\n\nOh love, light the way home\n\nLight up my soul\n\nI choose mercy instead of control\n\nMy life is on loan\n\nForgive and let go\n\nI embrace a belief I don't know\n\nWhat a beautiful sound\n\nTo lay your life down\n\nYour forgiveness is where I am found\n\nHere in your arms\n\nI finally let down\n\nI am lightning and you are the ground\n\nGive me the strength to let go\n\nI am lightning and you are the ground"
