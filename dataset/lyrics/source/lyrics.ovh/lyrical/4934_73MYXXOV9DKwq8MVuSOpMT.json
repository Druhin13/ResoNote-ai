  "lyrics": "When I grow up, I wanna be a superorganism\r\nCome on give it to me - put your mind in my brain so you'll see\r\nEverything is better when you're everything\r\nDon't let the kids such you up, in flux\r\nAwait for the seed to erupt and be gone\n\n\n\nEverybody wants to be a superorganism\n\n\n\nWhen I grow up, I need to be a superorganism\n\nCome on give it to me -- are you aware? are you alone with\n\nThe taste of architectures falling from my acid haste\n\n\n\nIt wasn't right for you to refuse\n\nIt's okay now you're part of the only thing alive\n\n\n\nEverybody wants to be a superorganism"
