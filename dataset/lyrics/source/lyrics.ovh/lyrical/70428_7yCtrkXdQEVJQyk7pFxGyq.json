  "lyrics": "I’m a walking mausoleum\r\nI’ve organized my grief by numbers\r\nWould you like to come inside?\r\nCuz everybody loves to hear\r\nA killer misanthropic story\r\nIt makes you feel more alive\n\nAnd now I’m getting older\n\nColder\n\nIt only takes one crack in the sky\n\nTo bring down all the lights\n\nSo put your head upon my shoulder\n\nAnd slide with me through my own slice of hell\n\nI’ve got so many secrets left to tell\n\n\n\nTime comes on like an avalanche\n\nThe ones we lose, you can’t get back\n\nMost days go by without a snag\n\n‘Til you’re standing in the hallway of your past\n\nWith the ones you can’t get back\n\n\n\nThere’s a garden on the corner\n\nWhere I found your dress & cigarettes\n\nThe ones that you left for me\n\nAnd a feeling runs me over\n\nIt hits me like the car that almost did\n\nThe day you had to leave\n\n\n\nBecause time comes on like an avalanche\n\nThe ones we lose, you can’t get back\n\nMost days go by without a snag\n\n‘Til you’re standing in the hallway of your past\n\nWith the ones you can’t get back\n\n\n\nNow I hear the bells"
