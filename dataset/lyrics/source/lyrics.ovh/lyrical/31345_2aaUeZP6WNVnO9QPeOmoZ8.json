  "lyrics": "I was a fool to trust you\r\nAnd a bigger fool to believe\r\nThat the very first time I would be the last\r\nI was easy to deceive\r\nThe temper flared and I've prouded up before\n\nBut this time I've said goodbye and nothing more\n\n\n\nAnd don't slam the door when you get out of my life\n\nI've been your fool and I'm glad I'm not your wife\n\nYou can save the tears cause I know how fast they dry\n\nAnd don't slam the door when you get out of my life\n\n\n\nI sat at home just waiting\n\nStaring at your empty chair\n\nWhile you were out with what's her name\n\nOr getting drunk somewhere\n\n\n\nThey say a cat has got nine lives my friend\n\nBut you're really out of luck with number ten\n\n\n\nAnd don't slam the door when you get out of my life\n\nI've been your fool and I'm glad I'm not your wife\n\nYou can save the tears cause I know how fast they dry\n\nAnd don't slam the door when you get out of my life\n\n\n\nThe temper flared and I've prouded up before\n\nThey say a cat has got nine lives my friend\n\n\n\nAnd don't slam the door when you get out of my life\n\nI've been your fool and I'm glad I'm not your wife\n\nYou can save the tears cause I know how fast they dry\n\nAnd don't slam the door when you get out of my life"
