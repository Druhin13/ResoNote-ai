Coming to see you soon\n\nI can hardly wait\n\nMurder another man, killer of Caliban\n\nCatatonic state\n\n\n\nI know it's only after midnight\n\nWe've still got time to have a good fight\n\nSo hit me back with all you can\n\nI know it's only what you wanted\n\nLove's so much better when you're hunted\n\nSomebody stole my eyes again\n\nStole my eyes\n\n\n\nRob me blind"
