  "lyrics": "The mornin' sun\r\nShines on your skin\r\n'Cause your white curtains\r\nThey are, paper thin\r\nWindows open\r\nI can feel the breeze\n\nBut we're safe here\n\nUnder the sheets\n\n\n\nI don't ever wanna leave\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nAnd listen to you breathe\n\nI don't ever wanna leave\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\n\n\nI never get\n\nBored of lookin' at you\n\n'Cause every time\n\nI see somethin' new\n\nLike the scar on your spine\n\nYou fell off of the roof\n\nWhen you were nine\n\nYou've lived a life\n\nBefore me\n\n\n\nI don't ever wanna leave\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nAnd listen to you breathe\n\nI don't ever wanna leave\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\n\n\n(I don't ever wanna leave\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nI don't ever wanna leave\n\nI'll watch you sleep\n\nI'll watch you sleep)"
