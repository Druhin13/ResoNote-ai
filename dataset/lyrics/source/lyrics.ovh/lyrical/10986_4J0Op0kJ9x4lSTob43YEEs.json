  "lyrics": "Tonight it's very clear, as we're both lying here\nThere's so many things, I want to say\nI will always love you, I would never leave you alone\n\nSometimes I just forget, say things I might regret\nIt breaks my heart to see you crying\n\nI don't wanna lose you, I could never make it alone\n\n\n\nI am a man, who will fight for your honor\n\nI'll be the hero you're dreaming of\n\nWe'll live forever, knowing together that we\n\nDid it all for the glory of love\n\n\n\nYou keep me standing tall, you help me through it all\n\nI'm always strong when you're beside me\n\nI have always needed you, I could never make it alone\n\n\n\nI am a man who will fight for your honor\n\nI'll be the hero you've been dreaming of\n\nWe'll live forever, knowing together that we\n\nDid it all for the glory of love\n\n\n\nJust like a knight in shining armor, from a long time ago\n\nJust in time I will save the day, take you to my castle far\n\naway\n\n\n\nI am a man who will fight for your honor\n\nI'll be the hero that you're dreaming of\n\nWe're gonna live forever, knowing together that we\n\nDid it all for the glory of love\n\n\n\nWe'll live forever, knowing together that we\n\nDid it all for the glory of love\n\n\n\nWe did it all for love, we did it all for love\n\nWe did it all for love, we did it all for love"
