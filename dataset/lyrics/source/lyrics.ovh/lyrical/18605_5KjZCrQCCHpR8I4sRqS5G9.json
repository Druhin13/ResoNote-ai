  "lyrics": "Twisted through so deep\r\nEverything you see is make-believe\r\nCastles in your sleep, never seem to reach but in dream\r\nDay after day\r\nYou spiral out and dive\n\nI give, you take\n\nThis is not what it's about\n\n\n\nDon't marry me for my money\n\nI've got this love for you honey, it's baby blue\n\nAnd I'll cover you, if you trust me\n\nI know it's hard for you lately\n\nTo take a view\n\n\n\nEvery stone you throw\n\nI see through I know just what you need\n\nSilently and slow, you catch every blow underneath\n\n\n\nDay after day\n\nYou spiral out and dive\n\nI give, you take\n\nThis is not what it's about\n\n\n\nDon't marry me for my money\n\nI've got this love for you honey, it's baby blue\n\nAnd I'll cover you, if you trust me\n\nI know it's hard for you lately\n\nTo take a view\n\n\n\nI'm tied to this\n\nCaught wrist to wrist\n\nTell me what, tell me what to do\n\nI'm tied to this\n\nCaught wrist to wrist\n\nTell me what, tell me what to do\n\nI'm tied to this\n\nCaught wrist to wrist\n\nTell me what, tell me what to do\n\nI'm tied to this\n\nCaught wrist to wrist\n\nTell me what, tell me what to do\n\nI'm tied to this\n\nCaught wrist to wrist\n\nTell me what, tell me what to do"
