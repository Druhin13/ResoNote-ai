  "lyrics": "I can feel the animal within\r\nI chain the beast and crawl inside myself\r\nI hear the call of violence\r\nI sleep no more and die again\r\nI've lost it all\n\nCarry me through this world alive\n\nI feel no more, the suffering\n\nBury me in this cold lie\n\nI feed the wolf, and shed my skin\n\n\n\nI can see the devil closing in\n\nI choke the breath that dies to cry for help\n\nI feel the pull of gravity\n\nI bleed no more, and rise again\n\nI've lost it all\n\n\n\nCarry me through this world alive\n\nI feel no more, the suffering\n\nBury me in this cold lie\n\nI feed the wolf, and shed my skin\n\n\n\nIt's no longer a human, \n\nIt's a beast, unmerciful, ferocious, fearless\n\nYou're a madman\n\nTampering with nature\n\nEvery man a vicious animal\n\n\n\nCarry me through this world alive\n\nI feel no more, the suffering\n\nBury me in this cold lie\n\nI feed the wolf, and shed my skin\n\n\n\nCarry me through this world alive\n\n(Fight the animal)\n\nI feel no more, the suffering\n\n(Fight the animal)\n\nBury me in this cold lie\n\n(Fight the animal)\n\nI feed the wolf, and shed my skin"
