  "lyrics": "I glow pink in the night in my room\r\nI've been blossoming alone over you\r\nAnd I hear my heart breaking tonight\r\nI hear my heart breaking tonight\r\nDo you hear it too?\r\nIt's like a summer shower\n\nWith every drop of rain singing\n\n\"I love you, I love you, I love you\n\nI love you, I love you, I love you\n\nI love you, I love you, I love you!\"\n\n\n\nI could stare at your back all day\n\nI could stare at your back all day\n\nAnd know I've kissed you before, but\n\nI didn't do it right\n\nCan I try again, try again, try again\n\nTry again, and again, and again\n\nAnd again, and again, and again"
