  "lyrics": "Ramblers in the wilderness we can't find what we need\r\nGet a little restless from the searching\r\nGet a little worn down in between\r\nLike a bull chasing the matador is the man left to his own schemes\r\nEverybody needs someone beside em' shining like a lighthouse from the sea\n\nBrother let me be your shelter\n\nI'll never leave you all alone\n\nI can be the one you call\n\nWhen you're low\n\nBrother let me be your fortress\n\nWhen the night winds are driving on\n\nBe the one to light the way\n\nBring you home\n\n\n\nFace down in the desert now there's a cage locked around my heart\n\nI found a way to drop the keys where my failures were\n\nNow my hands can't reach that far\n\nI ain't made for a robbery I could never take this world alone\n\nI know that in my weakness I am stronger\n\nIt's your love that brings me home"
