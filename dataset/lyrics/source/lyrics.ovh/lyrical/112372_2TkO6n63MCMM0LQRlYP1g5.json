  "lyrics": "Do you know that story about the Russian cosmonaut?\r\nSo, he goes up in this big spaceship\r\nAnd he's got this portal window\r\nAnd he's looking out of it\r\nAnd he sees the curvature of the Earth for the first time\r\nAnd all of a sudden, this strange ticking\n\nAnd it's coming out of the dashboard\n\n(Okay, yeah)\n\nBut he can't find it, he can't stop it\n\nIt keeps going\n\nA few hours into this, begins to feel like torture\n\nWhat's he gonna do?\n\nHe's up in space!\n\nSo the cosmonaut decides\n\nThe only way to save his sanity\n\nIs to fall in love with this sound"
