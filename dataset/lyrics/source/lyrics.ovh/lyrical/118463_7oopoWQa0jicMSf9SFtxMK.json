  "lyrics": "That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up\r\nThat nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up\r\nThat nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up\r\nI'ma get money by any means, run it up\r\nUh huh, to be, or not to be?\n\nHavin' 'em lit, if it ain't homicide I don't commit\n\nY'all throw a fit when you don't got a fit\n\nIf you put out a hit, bet you the killer ain't gon' make a cent\n\nBitch, it's a Miami nigga no Moonlight\n\nLet's take it back to the crib\n\nOne of my homies, he pull the gun on me\n\nHe turnin' cold on me like meet the maker\n\nSo super phony as if he don't know me\n\nI see what they told me about the hater\n\nAnd I wasn't even phased, been the hottest in the place\n\nTalkin' 'bout a nigga changed with a pocket full of change\n\nRange, this order, blame this for the pain in Florida\n\nBipolar, vibe over, time slower I'm sober, now I sorta see\n\nWhat is going on with me? (huh) Gotta shout-out homie G\n\nYou did wrong, but it's done for the right, new friends, new flies\n\nThey swarm to the light, money and a new girl\n\nThat's warm for the night\n\nDo a hoe like clothes they wore for the night like\n\n\n\nThat nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up\n\nThat nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up\n\nThat nigga lost, hittin' the lean, switch it up\n\nI'ma get money by any means, run it up\n\n\n\nUh huh, how can I see through my lenses\n\nWhen I can't see who my friend is, huh?\n\nWanna be down as dependent, would you give up your appendix?\n\nIf life is hangin' by a thread, then a nigga just might be dead\n\nIf my life was in your hands, now a nigga don't trust no man\n\nMaybe I shoulda been shot on the day that it happened\n\nWhen you started snappin' on me\n\nThey only seen what's on the one side\n\nIt's deeper than rap nigga and a nigga move back to the 3\n\nGet back to it with the boys in my hood 'cause it ain't no [?] no other\n\nI got new niggas tellin' these new niggas that I don't fuck with my brother\n\nThey only know Denzel Curry, but they really don't know Denzel\n\nEverybody wanna ride waves and jump when the ship don't sail\n\nYou did wrong, not done for the right\n\nNew friends, new flies, you flew to the life\n\nFunny what these new niggas might do for the hype\n\nLesson learned, I'm goin' on through with ya life like\n\n\n\nThat nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up\n\nThat nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up\n\nThat nigga lost, hittin' the lean, switch it up\n\nI'ma get money by any means, run it up\n\nThat nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up\n\nThat nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up\n\nThat nigga lost, hittin' the lean, switch it up\n\nI'ma get money by any means, run it up"
