  "lyrics": "Someone in the world tonight\r\nIs dancing on their own\r\nTrying hard to get it right\r\nTired of being alone\r\nUnspread open wide\r\nFace up to the sky\n\nThere's nobody by your side\n\nStill you're asking why\n\n\n\nIs there someone out there to keep you breathing,\n\nTryna find an answer to somehow stop this feeling\n\nCan you hold on? I'm through with losing\n\nIs there someone out there really loves you?\n\nIn the dark, near or far, find a heart who wants you\n\nCan you hold on? I'm through with losing\n\n\n\nI wonder how you sleep at night,\n\nAre all your roses thorn?\n\nIs everything in black & white,\n\nSince I've been gone?\n\n'Cause I don't know 'bout you now\n\nNow is gone, and ask you if, if your life turns upside down\n\nWhether you still reminisce?\n\nBut you know I wish you well, in everything you do\n\nBut it's me who left behind, and I have feelings,\n\nAnyway!\n\n\n\nIs there someone out there to keep you breathing,\n\nTryna find an answer to somehow stop this feeling\n\nCan you hold on? I'm through with losing\n\nIs there someone out there really loves you?\n\nIn the dark, near or far, find a heart who wants you\n\nCan you hold on? I'm through with losing\n\n\n\nIs there someone out there to keep you breathing,\n\nTryna find an answer to somehow stop this feeling\n\nCan you hold on? I'm through with losing\n\nIs there someone out there really loves you?\n\nIn the dark, near or far, find a heart who wants you\n\nCan you hold on? I'm through with losing\n\n\n\nI'm through with losing\n\nI'm through with losing\n\nI'm through with losing"
