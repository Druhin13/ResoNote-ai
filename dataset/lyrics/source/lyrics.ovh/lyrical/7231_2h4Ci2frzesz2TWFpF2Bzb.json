  "lyrics": "I do it for the love, yes I do\r\nSo you don't care about the money? well yes it's true\r\nAnd I'm so blessed to be fulfilling my destiny\r\nAll material things could mean less to me\r\nOnly thing I ever could need is a Sara B sample with a dope ass beat\r\nAnd get the mic check (check) are the levels right?\n\nAnd if it's good then I'll be here for several nights\n\nCuz the only thing I need is a strong supporting team\n\nThe most important thing that helps supporting my dream\n\nAnd I can't forget my family, Helpin keep my sanity\n\nNo matter what I do i kno othey'll always stand for me\n\n\n\nCuz I can only do me that's all I know\n\nDodge the difficulties and take life slow\n\nAnd if I ever slow up u know I'll always show up\n\nIt's still the same old me even-even if I blow up\n\nLove is what I do it for\n\nLove is why I'm rapping\n\nLove is the main reason for how all of this happened\n\nLove for all my fans love for all the shows\n\nGot love for all my memories no matter where I go\n\nEven if I amount to nothin, I know there's always something\n\nIt's not a fitness test but it'll always keep me running\n\nOne good thing bout music when it hits u feel no pain\n\nSo I keep it close to me make sure it never goes away\n\nUh From the start I knew it in my heart\n\nIf I made 1 person happy then I know I did my part\n\nNow if I stay into it and people dig the music\n\nI put on for my cities and know I'll always do it\n\nFor love"
