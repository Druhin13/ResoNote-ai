  "lyrics": "What if I could ice down all of my tears\r\nWould my face be covered in diamonds from ear to ear\r\nWould real niggas respect me then\r\nWill some of these white girls wanna be more than my friend\r\nIf I could take all of my tears and cry them into a chain\r\nI wonder how many million more followers I'd gain\n\nI bet my socials be super lit\n\nIt wouldn't even matter what type of vocals that I have to spit\n\nI could turn all this salty water that fell from my eyes into some diamond karats\n\nThen when I cry in public I could finally do so without having someone tell me I should feel embarrassed\n\nCause I'm not\n\nAnd I cried a whole lot when I filed a divorce and when the homie got shot\n\nAnd not one time did I laugh at Tyrese's tears\n\nCause when I was separated from my son I cried every day for almost a year\n\nAnd at near the end of that year span I was filled with joy\n\nCause my new fiance and I were expecting a baby boy\n\nBut after 40 weeks he was born without a heartbeat\n\nStill we chose to march forward instead of retreat\n\n\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nEven when it seemed impossible to take the next step\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nEven when it felt like God had his foot on my chest\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nEven when it felt like I couldn't take another breath\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nCause life is just a battle in the shadow of death\n\n\n\nWe bury Pooh in the very same day\n\nThey called us said they wanna take my baby away\n\nI beat the case but I didn't meet the eyes\n\nI got so many questions when I finally meet god\n\nLike why you make it so hard\n\nWhy you even let me try\n\nWhy my marriage couldn't work\n\nWhy you let my baby die\n\nI apologize for not\n\nYou about to hear a lot\n\nThis is not really music it's me dealing with my thoughts\n\nIt was breathe trauma (huh) breathe trauma (huh) breathe trauma (huh) breathe\n\nIt's hard to kill the drama when the trauma won't leave\n\nSo if karma does exist I find it hard to believe\n\nCause if you reap what you sow\n\nI didn't sow these seeds\n\nI need a Grammy for the damage, platinum plaque as a vantage\n\nA couple healthy kids before I start to understand it\n\nBut because the fans demand it and the label said I should\n\nI put it all into these songs and the hopes its understood\n\n\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nEven when it seemed impossible to take the next step\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nEven when it felt like God had his foot on my chest\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nEven when it felt like I couldn't take another breath\n\nI put one foot in front of the next\n\nCause life is just a battle in the shadow of death\n\n\n\nI've been crawling up the side of a mountain\n\nProblems, they got me falling back down\n\nKnow this, all the flames ill put em down\n\nAnd know ima climb out\n\nI've been crawling up the side of a mountain\n\nProblems, they got me falling back down\n\nKnow this, all the flames ill put em down\n\nAnd know ima climb out"
