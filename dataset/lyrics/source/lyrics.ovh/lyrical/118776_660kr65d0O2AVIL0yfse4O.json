  "title": "Born to Run",
  "lyrics": "In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream\r\nAt night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines\r\nSprung from cages out on highway 9,\r\nChrome wheeled, fuel injected\r\nand steppin' out over the line\r\nBaby this town rips the bones from your back\n\nIt's a death trap, it's a suicide rap\n\nWe gotta get out while we're young\n\n'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run\n\n\n\nWendy let me in I wanna be your friend\n\nI want to guard your dreams and visions\n\nJust wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims\n\nand strap your hands across my engines\n\nTogether we could break this trap\n\nWe'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back\n\nWill you walk with me out on the wire\n\n'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider\n\nBut I gotta find out how it feels\n\nI want to know if love is wild\n\ngirl I want to know if love is real\n\n\n\nBeyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard\n\nThe girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors\n\nAnd the boys try to look so hard\n\nThe amusement park rises bold and stark\n\nKids are huddled on the beach in a mist\n\nI wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight\n\nIn an everlasting kiss\n\n\n\nThe highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive\n\nEverybody's out on the run tonight\n\nbut there's no place left to hide\n\nTogether Wendy we'll live with the sadness\n\nI'll love you with all the madness in my soul\n\nSomeday girl I don't know when\n\nwe're gonna get to that place\n\nWhere we really want to go\n\nand we'll walk in the sun\n\nBut till then tramps like us\n\nbaby we were born to run"
