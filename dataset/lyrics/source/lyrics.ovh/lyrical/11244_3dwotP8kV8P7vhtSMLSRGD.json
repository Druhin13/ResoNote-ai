  "lyrics": "These voices inside of my mind they will try\r\nTo drive me insane\r\nBut everything's fine if I try to remain\r\nLike powder cocaine\r\nI be fine like powder cocaine\n\nAnd that's a hell of a drug, and that's a hell of a saying\n\nThey need elephant trunks to get it off of the plate\n\nI wanna better myself, they wanna dwell in the pain\n\nI wanna better my health, no umbrella for rain\n\nAnd that's a hell of a bug, I wanna live in my dreams\n\nGot an ocean in mind, they wanna settle for streams\n\nI wanna settle for more\n\nI wanna get knocked down so I could settle the score\n\nBetter than before as if that was possible\n\nTo shake the demons of my mother in the hospital\n\nDrove to a mansion and wrote this shit in front of it\n\n'Cause everybody covets the comfort of us becoming it (rich)\n\nAnd that's a hell of a drug, I caught a hell of a dream\n\nCaught a hell of a bug, fuck irrelevant things\n\nI've been moving at the speed of my life\n\nIgnorant to the price, I be fine like powder cocaine\n\n\n\nThese voices inside of my mind they will try\n\nTo drive me insane\n\nBut everything's fine if I try to remain\n\nLike powder cocaine\n\n\n\nI never boarded your plane, but I crossed your border\n\nGot a pocket of nails and we can prop these boards up\n\nI caught a fish this big like I would die for your sins\n\nIf it would cure my boredom\n\nI want knowledge of self and also everything else\n\nBut the gravity helps, yeah, reality's real\n\nWhen I finally fell, I told my family\n\n\"Well, when a battery dies it goes to battery hell\"\n\nBent, intent, inflict a dent in the cement\n\nMagnificent, brag like Sisyphus\n\nBoast like the host with the most upvotes\n\nI bought a spot in coach but got the bump-up hopes\n\nIt goes fine like the spot on my brain\n\nPut my notes in the book, from the top of the chain\n\nYou stood over to look like dinner and it's not a complaint\n\nBut I'm almost halfway out of the rain (I'm fine)\n\n\n\nThese voices inside of my mind they will try\n\nTo drive me insane\n\nBut everything's fine if I try to remain\n\nLike powder cocaine\n\nThese voices inside of my mind they will try\n\nTo drive me insane\n\nBut everything's fine if I try to remain\n\nLike powder cocaine"
