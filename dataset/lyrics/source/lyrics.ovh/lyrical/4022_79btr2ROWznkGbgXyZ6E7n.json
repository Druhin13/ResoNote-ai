  "lyrics": "You know I'm not so confrontational\r\nI get so lost in conversation when I'm with you\r\nI don't know why I'm so insatiable\r\nAnd you can't help but keep me waiting, now it's your move\r\nLook to the sky, I'm feeling vibes\n\nAre you down tonight, are you down tonight?\n\nLet down your guard, show me your scars\n\nAre you down tonight, are you down tonight?\n\nAre you\n\n\n\nLet's skip this part, where we talk about nothing like it's something\n\nYou can let down your guard, 'cause we only get real when we get real drunk\n\nAnd I know it must be hard, thinking like you can't\n\nOh god, just trust me\n\nIf you're feeling what I'm feeling, can we stop looking for reasons?\n\n\n\nLook to the sky, I'm feeling vibes\n\nAre you down tonight, are you down tonight?\n\nLet down your guard, show me your scars\n\nAre you down tonight, are you down tonight?\n\nAre you\n\n\n\nLet me rock your body, l-l-like a 95\n\nShe's waving to her friends, t-t-time to say goodbye\n\nShe hops up in my ride, s-s-slide it to the side\n\nShe said \"Cal, only thing that's getting swallowed is your pride\"\n\nDamn, keep her up all night, cold brew\n\nBlowing spirit bombs, on my, on my, on my Goku\n\nHigher and higher and higher\n\nLike there's no roof\n\nCall me Superman, 'cause I'm hopping out the phone booth\n\n\n\nLook to the sky, I'm feeling vibes\n\nAre you down tonight, are you down tonight?\n\nLet down your guard, show me your scars\n\nAre you down tonight, are you down tonight?\n\nAre you"
