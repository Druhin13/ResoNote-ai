  "lyrics": "Slave away, it's just another day\r\nIt's just another day without meaning\r\nBlue to gray, another bill to pay\r\nUntil you die under a glass ceiling\r\nGas prices rise, we numb our feelings\n\nMonetized and bipolarized\n\nBy the drugs that they've been dealing\n\n\n\nStaring awake at the ceiling\n\nYou promised never to forgive\n\nTearing apart at the seams, baby\n\nYou better learn to fucking live\n\n\n\nBecause this world don't give a shit\n\n\n\nRun the track and fucking play it back\n\nAnd ask yourself when you stopped believing\n\nLook inside, you can no longer hide\n\nThe discontentment that you've been feeling\n\n\n\nThere's so much more this life can hold\n\nIf you ignored the fucking broken record\n\nOf a dream you've bought and sold\n\n\n\nStaring awake at the ceiling\n\nYou promised never to forgive\n\nTearing apart at the seams, baby\n\nYou better learn to fucking live\n\n\n\nStaring awake at the ceiling\n\nYou promised never to forgive\n\nTearing apart at the seams, baby\n\nYou better learn to fucking live\n\n\n\nStaring awake at the ceiling\n\nYou promised never to forgive\n\nTearing apart at the seams, baby\n\nYou better learn to fucking live\n\n\n\nYou better learn to fucking live\n\nYou better learn to fucking live (Live, live, live)\n\nYou better learn to fucking live (Live, live, live)\n\nBecause this world don't give a shit"
