  "lyrics": "I picked up my life and I stuffed it in the bag\r\nOne way ticket out and I'm never coming back\r\nPeople say I'm crazy 'cause I left my world behind\r\nBut everything means nothing when there's noone by your side\r\nYou see I've had all the time to do my thinking\n\nAnd afer all the years that I was sinking\n\nThere's no map could tell the world just why I'm leaving\n\nBut home is not a place, home is a feeling\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll find it maybe I won't\n\nI gotta keep on moving even if I don't\n\nSometimes you will sometimes you won't\n\nNobody ever made it on their own\n\n\n\nI realised that's my time so I moved so far away\n\nYou know I look back at the city where my dream would slowly fade\n\nI know the roadless travel is the one I'd rather take\n\nBecause the loneliness is worth it for the memories I'll make\n\n\n\nYou see I've had all the time to do my thinking\n\nAnd afer all the years that I was sinking\n\nThere's no map could tell the world just why I'm leaving\n\nBut home is not a place, home is a feeling\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll find it maybe I won't\n\nI gotta keep on moving even if I don't\n\nSometimes you will sometimes you won't\n\nNobody ever made it on their own\n\n\n\nSo I'm jumping through the rivers and valleys\n\nCrawling out of each alley\n\nSomething, push me out of my comfort\n\nI've been searching all over for my mine, searching for you, baby!\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll find it maybe I won't\n\nI gotta keep on moving even if I don't\n\nSometimes you will sometimes you won't\n\nNobody ever made it on their own\n\nNobody ever made it on their own"
