  "lyrics": "You said no matter what that you'd be honest\r\nYou said, \"Now darling, I'll take care of you\"\r\nBut last night when you broke another promise\r\nI started to question what the truth is\r\nWake up in the morning\n\nSomething's different in this light\n\nIt's like everything is perfect\n\nYou don't know what you did last night\n\nOh, you know the worst thing is\n\nI don't wanna have this fight\n\nYou're saying that it's not that\n\nYou say that every time\n\n\n\nSo don't blame the liquor\n\nFor the things you say that you don't mean\n\nThe small things, get bigger\n\nYou're poking holes in you and me\n\n\n\nI know that you've got the best intentions\n\nI know that you mean the things you say\n\nBut forever isn't something you should mention\n\nIf you keep making all the same mistakes\n\n\n\nWake up in the morning\n\nSomething's different in this light\n\nIt's like everything is perfect\n\nYou don't know what you did last night\n\nOh, you know the worst thing is\n\nI can see how hard you try\n\nYou don't wanna hurt me\n\nBut that doesn't make it right\n\n\n\nSo don't blame the liquor\n\nFor the things you say that you don't mean\n\nThe small things, get bigger\n\nYou're poking holes in you and me\n\n\n\nAnd ooh, I swear you change me\n\nYou're upset\n\nAnd do things I can't forget\n\nBut, darling, something's got to change\n\nBefore it's too late\n\nYou could paint a picture of\n\nPut your heart in every line\n\nBut the things that we just miss out\n\nDoing damage over time\n\nDon't wanna wake up one day and\n\nWonder why I just stood by\n\nKept it on the inside\n\nNo, something wasn't right\n\n\n\nSo don't blame the liquor\n\nFor the things you say that you don't mean\n\nThe small things, get bigger\n\nYou're poking holes in you and me\n\n\n\nYou're poking holes, you're poking holes\n\nYou're poking holes in you and me\n\nYou're poking holes, you're poking holes\n\nYou're poking holes in you and me"
