  "lyrics": "When she said that you were through\r\nI thought that there was nothing that I could d\r\nJust because she ran right here\r\nDoesn't mean I interfered\r\nNow I'm wondering of we can feel the same\r\nCause she keeps whispering your name\n\nShe keeps on whispering your name\n\nLike she's just waiting\n\n\n\nShe once told me how she felt\n\nDidn't just want me to hear it from someone else\n\nThere were unknowns she couldn't know\n\nBut she hoped you two would grow\n\nAnd when you didn't she was brought to me in pain\n\n\n\nAnd she keeps whispering your name\n\nShe keeps on whispering your name\n\nLike she's just waiting\n\n\n\nIf it's just a little fling a simple thing\n\nI'll try not to pretend\n\nIf it's just for jealousy she's using me\n\nThat might be hard to mend\n\n\n\nOh what else can I do\n\nBut try to give her more than she got from you\n\nAnd when she wakes up suddenly and she says you name to me\n\nI'll just hope its force of habit and not need\n\n\n\nCause she keeps whispering your name\n\nShe keeps on whispering your name\n\nLike she's just waiting\n\n\n\nOh tell me what is fair\n\nWhen nothing's wrong\n\nAnd she just stares\n\nLike she's just waiting"
