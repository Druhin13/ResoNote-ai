  "title": "For What It's Worth",
  "lyrics": "I see me breathing in, but there's no life entering,\nInto my soul, just a space, just a hole.\nFor what it's worth, I will not love again.\n\nTear the sky with your eyes, repeat your name until insane.\nCome back to me where I need you to be.\n\nFor what it's worth, I will not love again.\n\nBreak my heart until it cracks, till it stops"
