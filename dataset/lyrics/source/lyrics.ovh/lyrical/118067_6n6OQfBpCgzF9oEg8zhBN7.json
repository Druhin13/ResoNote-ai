  "lyrics": "Met a man wearing a T-shirt, said \"Virginia is for lovers\"\r\nHad a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other\r\nHe said \"All you're really given is the sunshine and your name\"\r\nWe both started laughin' when the sky started to rain\r\nGet along, on down the road\n\nWe've got a long long way to go\n\nScared to live, scared to die\n\nWe ain't perfect but we try\n\n\n\nGet along while we can\n\nAlways give love the upper hand\n\nPaint a wall, learn to dance\n\nCall your mom, buy a boat\n\nDrink a beer, sing a song\n\nMake a friend, can't we all get along?\n\n\n\nSaw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me\n\nWondered was she photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?\n\nDid she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?\n\nDid she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?\n\n\n\nGet along, on down the road\n\nWe've got a long long way to go\n\nScared to live, scared to die\n\nWe ain't perfect but we try\n\n\n\nGet along while we can\n\nAlways give love the upper hand\n\nPaint a wall, learn to dance\n\nCall your mom, buy a boat\n\nDrink a beer, sing a song\n\nMake a friend, can't we all get along?\n\n\n\nYou find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought\n\nWe still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not\n\nSometimes you got to\n\n\n\nGet along, on down the road\n\nWe've got a long long way to go\n\nScared to live, scared to die\n\nWe ain't perfect but we try\n\n\n\nGet along while we can\n\nAlways give love the upper hand\n\nPaint a wall, learn to dance\n\nCall your mom, buy a boat\n\nDrink a beer, sing a song\n\nMake a friend, can't we all get along?"
