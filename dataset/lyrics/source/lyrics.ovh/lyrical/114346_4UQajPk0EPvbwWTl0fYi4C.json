So bad\n\nIs it weird that I'm drunken on my sofa?\n\nIs it weird that I'm naked on my sofa?\n\nAll alone, damn, I wish I didn't know ya\n\nIs it weird? So weird\n\n\n\nI know I’m the stupid one who ended it\n\nAnd now I'm the stupid one regretting it\n\nIt took me a couple drinks to admit it\n\nI know I’m the stupid one\n\n\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nOh, are you moving along?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nHave you been filling empty beds just like me?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nOh, are you moving along?\n\n\n\nIs it wrong if I ask you to come over?\n\nIs it wrong if I tell ya that I love ya?\n\nEven though I'd never do it when I'm sober\n\nIs it wrong? So wrong\n\n\n\nI know I’m the stupid one who ended it\n\nAnd now I'm the stupid one regretting it\n\nIt took me a couple drinks to admit it\n\nI know I’m the stupid one\n\n\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nOh, are you moving along?\n\nBeen thinking about you lots, lately\n\nHave you been filling empty beds just like me?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nOh, are you moving along?\n\n\n\nScared of moving on, but you're already gone\n\nSo if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me?\n\nScared of moving on, but you’re already gone\n\nSo if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me?\n\n\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nHave you been eating breakfast alone like me?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nOh, are you moving along?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nHave you been filling empty beds just like me?\n\nThinking about you lots, lately\n\nOh, are you moving along?\n\n\n\nScared of moving on, but you're already gone\n\nSo if you’re moving on, won't you just tell me?\n\nAre you moving along?"
