  "lyrics": "Never knew my old man's truck could even run like that\r\nShould've known better than to take that curve so fast\r\nDaddy pulled up, I was down in a ditch\r\nHe asked me why I did what I did\r\nThere was this girl, drink in her hand\n\nShootin' me a \"let's get into trouble\" grin\n\nI ain't never seen somethin' so fine\n\nAnd I was doin' anything to make her mine\n\nI was out of my mind, she was out of this world\n\nThere was this girl\n\n\n\nSome folks ask me why I still pick this guitar\n\nThey say livin' that life on the road won't get you very far\n\nI say man you should've been down in Tupelo\n\nSeen what was in the front row\n\n\n\nThere was this girl, beer in her hand\n\nShootin' me a \"play a little Skynyrd\" grin\n\nShe's turnin' it up, she's turnin' me on\n\nAnd I'd play her anything she'd sing along\n\nI was out of my mind, she was out of this world\n\nThere was this girl\n\nYeah there was this girl\n\n\n\nDidn't know a diamond ring could cost so much (damn)\n\nTook six months on a farm 'fore I saved up\n\nAll my drinkin' buddies still out on the town\n\nWonderin' why I ever settled down\n\n\n\nBut there was this girl, holdin' my hand\n\nShootin' me a \"start a life together\" grin\n\nShe's pullin' me in, she's straightenin' me out\n\nAnd now I know what love is all about\n\nI'm still out of my mind, she's still out of this world\n\nThere was this girl\n\n\n\nYeah, there was this girl\n\nYeah, there was this girl\n\nThere was this girl"
