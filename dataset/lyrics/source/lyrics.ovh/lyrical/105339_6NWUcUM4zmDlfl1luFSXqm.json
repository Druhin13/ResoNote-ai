  "lyrics": "There's nothing inside\r\nNot dead or alive\r\nNo feeling to find\r\nLike I've been hypnotized\r\nHow do I see\r\nA lot in the dark\n\nWhen nothing is real\n\nAnd I don't hear a heart\n\n\n\nI can't wake up from this cold dark state\n\nOf hopelessness, so numb to everything\n\n\n\nIt's under my skin\n\nLiving within\n\nI'm chained to my mind\n\nSo undignified\n\nRun from the tide\n\nThat's rising so high\n\nCome wash me away\n\n'Cause I've no will to fight\n\n\n\nTime won't wait for me to bend and break\n\nDon't want to be so numb to everything\n\n(In this coma!)\n\n\n\nI'm free falling and the black hole opens\n\nVicious circle leading me to lie\n\nI keep swimming through an empty ocean\n\nIn slow motion, in slow motion\n\nI'm free falling and the black hole opens\n\nVicious circle leading me to lie\n\nI keep swimming through an empty ocean\n\nIn slow motion, in slow motion\n\n\n\nTime won't wait for me to bend and break\n\nDon't want to be so numb to everything\n\n(In this coma!)\n\n\n\nI'm free falling and the black hole opens\n\nVicious circle leading me to lie\n\nI keep swimming through an empty ocean\n\nIn slow motion, in slow motion\n\nI'm free falling and the black hole opens\n\nVicious circle leading me to lie\n\nI keep swimming through an empty ocean\n\nIn slow motion, in slow motion\n\nI'm free falling and the black hole opens\n\n\n\nIn this coma!\n\n(I'm free falling and the black hole opens)\n\nIn this coma!"
