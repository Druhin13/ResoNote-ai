  "lyrics": "Ooh, ooh\r\nOoh, ooh\r\nSee I'm not holy, but tell me who is?\r\nA priest can be saintly or a hypocrite\r\nAt least I'm truthful when it comes to you\n\nThere's no hiding the things I do\n\n\n\nSee, I can go about my day\n\nKnowing someone won't care if I change\n\nI know I get down on my luck\n\nBut I can trust you to pull me up\n\n\n\nSo, I could fall into hell\n\nAnd you would still love me the same way\n\nI could face twenty years\n\nAnd you would still love me through the tears\n\nAnd we can handle anything that comes our way\n\n'Cause I got your love, you know that I'm here to stay\n\nSo I could fall into hell\n\nYou would still love me the same\n\nThe same, mmm\n\n\n\nSee you can have judgement in your voice\n\nWithout even knowing, I'll make the better choice\n\nAnd you've always taught me to stick to my guns\n\nDon't need a religion to tell me I am wrong\n\n\n\nAnd I can go about my day\n\nKnowing someone won't care if I change\n\nI know I get down on my luck\n\nBut I can trust you to pull me up\n\n\n\nSo, I could fall into hell\n\nAnd you would still love me the same way\n\nI could face twenty years\n\nAnd you would still love me through the tears\n\nAnd we can handle anything that comes our way\n\n'Cause I got your love, you know that I'm here to stay\n\nSo I could fall into hell\n\nAnd you would still love me the same\n\n\n\nOh yeah, mmm, mmm"
