  "lyrics": "Took your car\r\nDrove to Texas\r\nSorry, honey\r\nBut I suspected we were through\r\nAnd I can't cry anymore\r\nSince I left\n\nBeen feelin' better, cause that's\n\nWhat you get when you\n\nStay together too long\n\nAnd I can't cry anymore\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWouldn't it be good if\n\nwe could hop a flight to anywhere\n\nSo long to this life\n\nSo much for pretending\n\nBad luck's never-ending\n\nAnd now I know that\n\n\n\nMoney comes in\n\nBut the fact is\n\nThere's not enough to\n\nPay my taxes\n\nAnd I can't cry anymore\n\nWell, got a brother\n\nHe's got real problems\n\nHeroin - no\n\nThere's just no stopping him tonight\n\nAnd I won't cry anymore\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nIt's never ending\n\n\n\nIt could be worse\n\nI could've missed my calling\n\nSometimes it hurts \n\nBut when you read the writing on the wall\n\nCan't cry anymore\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nAnd too much time I've been spending\n\nWith my heart in my hands \n\nWaiting for time to come and mend it\n\n\n\nI can't cry anymore"
