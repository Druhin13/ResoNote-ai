  "lyrics": "She packed all her bags and went on her way\r\nBack to where they laid\r\nThe cat's been crying out\r\nWandering all alone around the house\r\nI really hope you're happy where you are now\n\nJust get it all out\n\nPut it in a song\n\nJust get it all out\n\nWrite another song\n\nAnna, Anna\n\n\n\nBed bound doesn't feel the same without you\n\nYou are the other half\n\nThe missing parts\n\nThe sleepless muse\n\nAnd you said I've got a lot of problems\n\nAnd one of them is always you\n\nBut I'm fine with that\n\nLet's just work on it\n\nI mean you've got yours too\n\n\n\nJust get it all out\n\nPut it in a song\n\nJust get it all out\n\nWrite another song\n\nAnna, Anna, Anna\n\n\n\nDon't get used to the isolation\n\nYou're gonna want it when your gone\n\nWhen there's no one with any patience\n\nAnd you think\n\n\"Are they my friends, or do I just want something from them\"\n\nThe endless record spinning inside my head\n\n\n\nJust get it all out\n\nPut it in a song\n\nJust get it all out\n\nWrite another song\n\nAnna come on, tell 'em what went wrong\n\nJust get it all out\n\nWrite another song\n\nAnna\n\n\n\nShe packed all her bags and went on her way"
