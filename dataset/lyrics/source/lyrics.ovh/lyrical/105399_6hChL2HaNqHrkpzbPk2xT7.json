  "lyrics": "Yeah, levitatin' of the blacktop\r\nUsed to struggle getting started now I can’t stop\r\nUsed to be the quiet kid in the sandbox\r\nNow it’s “Hands up” every time that your man rocks\r\nYou oughta stop me coming in again\r\nYou mad? You thought we were synonyms\n\nToo bad, that’s the water you’re gettin' in\n\nYou’re too fat for the sharks that you’re swimming in\n\nWhen I’m sitting contenders, lookin' like fruits spinnin' around in a blender\n\nHardly a snack when I’m here lookin' for dinner\n\nI eat ‘em, delete 'em, they’re barely beginners\n\nMain course is my main sport\n\nPlay major, but minor’s my main fort\n\nPut a chain around everything I came for\n\nLook but don’t touch, I could tell 'em take an I.O.U!\n\n\n\nSay they want respect now, thinking they deserve to have it next now\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\nLeavin' what they makin' up, talking loud but never really sayin' much\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\nI been drawin' plans out and they think I'm givin' them a handout\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\nThinking they're entitled to a piece, no, I don't think so\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\n\n\nLevitatin' in the blackout\n\nUsed to drink at least a forty, for we mashed out\n\nUsed to think that workin’ forty was a max-out\n\nNow I’m workin' even when I’m sleepin', do the math now\n\n‘Cause even when I’m sleepin’, eyes keep ‘em open\n\nStrapped across and both the color of your hemoglobin\n\nA huge act man like I’m known for being Logan\n\nNext twenty-three and came to leave 'em with a femur broken\n\nTakin’ it too far, I don’t know maybe\n\nFriends like “Mike I don’t know who you are lately”\n\nBut pride and hate has made nay-sayers mistake me\n\nFor wasting brain space on ratings they gave me\n\nI don’t need your respect, I got history\n\nI’m 81 Reagan with that nonsense, miss me\n\nFather like Francis, Anakin or John Misty\n\nNot to be touched, sucker\n\nTell ‘em take an I.O.U!\n\n\n\nSay they want respect now, thinking they deserve to have it next now\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\nLeavin' what they makin' up, talking loud but never really sayin' much\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\nI been drawin' plans out and they think I'm givin' them a handout\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U\n\nThinking they're entitled to a piece, no, I don't think so\n\nTell 'em take an I.O.U"
