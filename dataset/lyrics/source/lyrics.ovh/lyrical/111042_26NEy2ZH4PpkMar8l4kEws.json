  "lyrics": "Here I stand, alone, with hate\r\nHere I stand, too long, too late\r\nAll I know, is you will leave us all\r\nHere I stand, alone, to fall\r\nOh my Brother, how could you?\n\nNot look into the eyes of your fellow man\n\nWho stood with you, through it all\n\nAnd feel nothing in your heart but hate\n\n\n\nRed stain on the blade\n\nAll sense of worth has been washed away\n\nSacrifice was all in vain\n\nWhere's the sense of guilt? Where's the shame?\n\n\n\nLost soul in the unmarked grave\n\nWe have given a name\n\nBlack flame\n\nIn death we are all the same\n\nRemain, black flame\n\n\n\nLost soul in the unmarked grave\n\nWe have given a name\n\nBlack flame\n\nIn death we are all the same\n\nRemain, black flame\n\n\n\nHere I stand, alone, with hate\n\nHere I stand, too long, too late\n\n\n\nBurn, and let your soul be free\n\nAs the flames rise high and your spirit leaves\n\nNightmares have become too real\n\nNow the world is screaming and it's hard to hear\n\n\n\nRed stain on the blade\n\nAll sense of worth has been washed away\n\nHow could you be hollow?\n\nNow your life is doomed to sorrow\n\n\n\nLost soul in the unmarked grave\n\nWe have given a name\n\nBlack flame\n\nIn death we are all the same\n\nRemain, black flame\n\n\n\nLost soul in the unmarked grave\n\nWe have given a name\n\nBlack flame\n\nIn death we are all the same\n\nRemain, black flame\n\n\n\nWe are all the same\n\nBlack flame\n\nWe have given a name\n\n\n\nLost soul in the unmarked grave\n\nWe have given a name\n\nBlack flame\n\nIn death we are all the same\n\nRemain, black flame\n\n\n\nLost soul in the unmarked grave\n\nWe have given a name\n\nBlack flame\n\nIn death we are all the same\n\nRemain, black flame"
