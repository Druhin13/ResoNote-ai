  "lyrics": "Here's a story about a sinner\r\nHe used to be a winner\r\nWho enjoyed a life of prominence and position\r\nBut the pressures at the office\r\nAnd his socialite engagements\r\nAnd his selfish wife's fanatical ambition\n\n\n\nBut it turned him to the booze\n\nAnd he got mixed up with a floosie\n\nAnd she led him to a life of indecision\n\nThe floosie made him spend his dole\n\nShe left him lying on skid row\n\nA drunken drag in some salvation army mission\n\n\n\nIt's such a shame\n\n\n\nOh, demon alcohol\n\nSad memories I can't recall\n\nWho thought I would say\n\nDamn it all and blow it all\n\nOh, demon alcohol\n\nSad memories I can't recall\n\nWho thought I would fall\n\nA slave to demon alcohol\n\n\n\nBarley wine, pink gin\n\nHe'll drink anything\n\nPort, pernod or tequila\n\nRum, scotch, vodka on the rocks\n\nAs long as all his troubles disappeared\n\n\n\nBut he messed up his life\n\nWent and beat up his wife\n\nAnd the floosie's gone and found another sucker\n\nShe's gonna lead him on to drink\n\nShe's gonna lead him to the brink\n\nAnd when his money's gone, she'll leave him in the gutter\n\n\n\nIt's such a shame\n\n\n\nOh, demon alcohol\n\nSad memories I can't recall\n\nWho thought I would say\n\nDamn it all and blow it all\n\nOh, demon alcohol\n\nSad memories I can't recall\n\nWho thought I would fall\n\nA slave to demon alcohol"
