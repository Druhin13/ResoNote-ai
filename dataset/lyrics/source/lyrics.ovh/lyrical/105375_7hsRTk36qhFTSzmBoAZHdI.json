  "lyrics": "I can feel your destruction building up under pressure\r\nI carry on like a ghost, but I'm addicted to a time bomb\r\nJust another, just another hit from this eight-shot party barrel\r\nGet the wolves and feed their souls\r\nCan't figure out where we're meant to be\n\nStuck in here with a siren screaming\n\nWe try to leave\n\nJust turn the clocks back over\n\nCan we go back to the start once more?\n\nJust holding on like when we were younger\n\nThat night was pure\n\nWe drove forever\n\n\n\nI can steal that young heart\n\nBut by God, I'm on the market for a barrel of fresh blood\n\n\n\nGive me a way home\n\nGive me a way out, here comes dawn\n\nI need a fucking hero\n\nTo show me a way out of this storm\n\n\n\nI hope that one day to bring us back\n\nFrom the depths, from the scars, from everything turning black\n\nThe midnight ghosts are woken\n\nGet it back, that hunger\n\nGet it screaming, get those bones back on the fire\n\nEmbrace thrasher\n\n\n\nThey keep coming back stronger\n\nThey keep coming back stronger\n\nCome and attack, come and attack\n\nHope, faith, blind, fear, cult, set\n\n\n\nGive me a way home\n\nGive me a way out, here comes dawn\n\nI need a fucking hero\n\nTo show me a way out of this storm\n\n\n\nThey started installing dread just like they knew they could\n\nThose perfect hearts burst to flames just like they knew they would\n\nBelief in chemicals, releasing monsters\n\nThis failing empire will suck them all to hell\n\n\n\nDarker, deeper, wiser\n\nStronger, unholy, corrupted\n\nDarker, deeper\n\nUnholy, corrupted\n\n\n\nGive me a way home\n\nGive me a way out, here comes dawn\n\nI can steal that young heart\n\nBut by God, I'm on the market for a barrel of fresh blood\n\nI need a fucking hero\n\nTo show me a way out of this storm\n\nI'll ask again\n\nBut I say falling on deaf ears under that broken back and bloody gun"
