  "lyrics": "Sitting on your throne you rest your pretty bones\r\nDon't act like you're alive\r\nTake another chance to do this on my own\r\nBut you will let it die\r\nFeels like a lifetime living in this pain\r\nA whole world passes me by\n\nLosing the daylight but I must admit\n\nThat you're suiting for this lie\n\nAnother lie\n\n\n\nWe will fight back through your broken past and you fade away\n\nThrow the first stone\n\nWe will arrive through [?] till you don't believe\n\n\n\nFear, hate, love\n\nTake it to your grave\n\nFear, hate, love\n\nTake it to your grave\n\n\n\nEveryday you grind your teeth and spit our blood\n\nDripping down from your own life\n\nSwinging from the axe it crashes and it hits\n\nSo I'll not even try\n\nEven try\n\n\n\nWe will fight back through your broken past and you fade away\n\nThrow the first stone\n\nWe will arrive through [?] till you don't believe\n\nSay goodbye to the world you know\n\nSay goodbye to your mask of hope\n\nWe will fight back through your broken past and you fade away\n\nThrow the first stone\n\n\n\nSave your words this only time\n\nTo kill the way you made me\n\nSo save your words, I'm moving on\n\nThere's only hate within me\n\nYou're finally my enemy\n\nThe time has come for you to know\n\nJust save your words this only time\n\nTo kill the life you gave me\n\nI won't go back\n\n\n\nWe will fight back through your broken past and you fade away\n\nThrow the first stone\n\nWe will arrive through [?] till you don't believe\n\nSay goodbye to the world you know\n\nSay goodbye to your mask of hope\n\nWe will fight back through your broken past and you fade away\n\n\n\nFear, hate, love\n\nTake it to your grave\n\nFear, hate, love\n\nTake it to your grave"
