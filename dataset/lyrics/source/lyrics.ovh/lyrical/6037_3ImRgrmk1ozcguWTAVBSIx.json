  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Tenenbaum par The Paper Kites\r\nYou're a bitter kind\nOut of you sow\nSour is my mind\nFor what you sow\n\nHow I let it grow\nCall them radiant\nCall them mother's eyes\nHomes and narrow space for me to find\nYour beguiling states in endless heights\nJust not moving right\nJust not moving right when it's just not you\n\nUnder neon lights\nWhere I wake\nI'm not feeling right\n\nSo they say\nRough kind of a day\nDone my clothing, robes of ancient white\nRattled windows on the old green line\nDo you feel it like I hope you might ?\nJust not seeing right\nJust not seeing right\nWhen its just not you"
