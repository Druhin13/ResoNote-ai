  "lyrics": "Oh, I ran once\r\nTook my fight across the ocean\r\nI thought if I could make my way\r\nAcross the sea, I'd find a place\r\nNow I'm swallowed up\r\nBy a city that doesn't give a fuck\n\nTo whether I am up on time\n\nOr whether if I'm, well, alive\n\nAnd I'm so good, getting too good at hiding\n\nToo good at keeping to myself\n\nThat I'm spiraling\n\n\n\nI have fell before\n\nFor some who have wanted me more\n\nThan I could've wanted them\n\nSome call it selfishness\n\nBut I'm so scared\n\nI'm so scared of the voices\n\nThey're telling me I'll end up alone\n\n\n\nOh I heard once\n\nYou only love when you're lonely\n\nAnd you smile when you're hurting\n\nSo it doesn't concern them\n\nBut I'm so tired\n\nI'm just so tired of hiding\n\nI'm so tired of keeping to myself\n\nThat I'm spiraling out of control\n\nI'm so tired of keeping to myself"
