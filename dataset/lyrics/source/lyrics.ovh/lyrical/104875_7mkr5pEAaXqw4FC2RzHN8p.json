  "lyrics": "Ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies\r\nCareful what you wish for\r\nWe're looking for angels in the darkest of skies\r\nSaying that we wanted more\r\nI feel like I'm falling, but I'm trying to fly\r\nWhere does all the good go?\n\nWe're looking for answers in the highest of highs\n\nBut will we ever, ever know?\n\n\n\nAnd I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle\n\nBut if love is enough, could you let it show?\n\nIf you feel it could you, could you let me know?\n\nI'm not asking for a miracle\n\n\n\nAsk for forever when the end is in sight\n\nShowing what you want to\n\nWe're looking for the light in an ocean of night\n\nBut will we ever see it through?\n\n\n\nAnd I need you to know I'm not asking for a miracle\n\nBut if love is enough, could you let it show?\n\nIf you feel it could you, could you let me know?\n\nI'm not asking for a miracle"
