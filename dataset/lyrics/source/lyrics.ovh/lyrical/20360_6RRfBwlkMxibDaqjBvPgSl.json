  "lyrics": "I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel\r\nYou were talking so brave and so sweet\r\nGivin' me head on the unmade bed\r\nWhile the limousines wait in the street\r\nThose were the reasons, that was New York\n\nWe were runnin' for the money and the flesh\n\nAnd that was called love for the workers in song\n\nProbably still is for those of them left\n\n\n\nBut you got away, didn't you babe?\n\nYou just turned your back on the crowd\n\nWhen you got away, I never once heard you say\n\n\n\nI need you\n\nI don't need you\n\nI need you\n\nI don't need you\n\nAnd all of that jivin' around\n\n\n\nI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel\n\nYou were famous, your heart was a legend\n\nYou told me again, you preferred handsome men\n\nBut for me you would make an exception\n\n\n\nAnd clenching your fist for the ones like us\n\nWho are oppressed by the figures of beauty\n\nYou fixed yourself, you said \"Well nevermind\n\nWe are ugly but we have the music\"\n\n\n\nAnd then you got away didn't you babe?\n\nYou just turned your back on the crowd\n\nWhen you got away I never once heard you say\n\n\n\nI need you\n\nI don't need you\n\nI need you\n\nI don't need you\n\nAnd all of that jivin' around\n\n\n\nI don't mean to suggest\n\nThat I loved you the best\n\nI can't keep track of each fallen robin\n\nI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel\n\nThat's all, I don't think of you that often"
