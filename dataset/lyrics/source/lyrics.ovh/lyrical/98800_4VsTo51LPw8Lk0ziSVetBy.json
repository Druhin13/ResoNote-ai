  "lyrics": "Well you said you were embarrassed to be alone\r\nIn a crowded room with strangers\r\nHoping someone would come and say hello\r\nAnd be your mighty savior\r\nTo take you somewhere else, could be anywhere\r\nJust as long as it is far from here\n\nWhen the season ends you’ll be all alone\n\nWondering why things can’t just stay\n\n\n\nStay the same\n\nStay the same (Always)\n\n\n\nWell I thought it would be nice just to walk with you\n\nTogether through the garden\n\nTrying to hold it all as we went along\n\nUntil there was no more room for\n\nThe pieces that didn’t fit anyway\n\nThough you did all that you could to save them all\n\nThere was never a way to save them all\n\n\n\nStay the same\n\nStay the same\n\nDon’t you change for anybody or anything\n\n(I don't really care where you came from)\n\nThe way everything else does\n\n(As long as you don't have to go back soon)\n\nStay the same\n\n(I don't really care where you came from)\n\nAlways\n\n(As long as you don't have to go back soon)\n\n\n\nSpinning so hard, sometimes I wanna get off\n\nOf a callous world as it falls apart\n\nLike it’s got a reason to (everybody needs one)\n\nI’ll give you a reason to stay\n\n\n\n(I don't really care where you came from)\n\n(As long as you don't have to go back soon)\n\nStay the same\n\n(I don't really care where you came from)\n\n(As long as you don't have to go back soon)\n\nDon’t you change for anybody or anything\n\n(I don't really care where you came from)\n\nThe way everything else does\n\n(As long as you don't have to go back soon)\n\nStay the same\n\n(I don't really care where you came from)\n\nAlways\n\n(As long as you don't have to go back soon)"
