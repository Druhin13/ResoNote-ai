  "lyrics": "And I fly\r\nFurther away\r\nThan I've ever been before\r\nIt's safe to say\r\nThis sky\n\nIs lonely and grey\n\nBut every night I feel your gravity waves\n\n\n\nAnd the world is cold\n\nBut it's beautiful\n\nI wish you were here now\n\nI miss your soul\n\nBut you lost your light\n\nWhen the darkness called\n\nBut I stand here waiting\n\n\n\nThe last to fall\n\n\n\nAnd I fly\n\nAbove the enslaved\n\nMy soul is burning\n\nLike an earth reclaimed\n\nAnd I try\n\nA final crusade\n\nThis world is changing\n\nBut I'm still the same\n\n\n\nAnd will you be bold\n\nWill you lose control?\n\nI could never desert you\n\nI could never let go\n\n\n\nIf you fall in line\n\nAnd the zenith calls\n\nI'm standing waiting\n\nThe last to fall\n\n\n\nIt's your magnetic hold\n\nA gravity pull\n\nI can feel you in waves\n\nWhen your melody comes\n\nIt falls from above\n\nI will not be afraid"
