Go find someone tryna listen\n\nSo don’t waste time tryna tell me (don't you waste time tryna tell me)\n\nWhat you think I want to hear, baby\n\nTalk is cheap\n\n\n\nTalk is cheap. Got to show me it's real (you got to show me it's real)\n\n'Cause I ain't got time to waste (time to)\n\nNo I don’t sleep (I don’t sleep)\n\nI think you know what the deal is\n\nSo don’t you feed that stuff to me\n\nTalk is cheap\n\n\n\nDon't you know that talk is cheap \n\nSo don’t you waste your time on me\n\nI don’t roll with wannabe’s\n\nDon’t you know that talk is cheap (Talk is cheap)\n\nDon't you know that talk is cheap \n\nSo don’t you waste your time on me\n\nI don’t roll with wannabe’s\n\nDon’t you know that talk is cheap (Talk is cheap)\n\nDon't you know that talk is cheap \n\nSo don’t you waste your time on me\n\nI don’t roll with wannabe’s\n\nDon’t you know that talk is cheap \n\nDon't you know that talk is cheap \n\nSo don’t you waste your time on me\n\nI don’t roll with wannabe’s\n\nDon’t you know that talk is cheap yeah."
