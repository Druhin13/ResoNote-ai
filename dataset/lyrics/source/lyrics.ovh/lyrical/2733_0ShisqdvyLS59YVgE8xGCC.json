  "lyrics": "I'm a love, love refugee\r\nDon't let nobody get close to me\r\nI'm a hard, hard fugitive\r\nAlways running that's the way I live\r\nCause when you go solo, end up feeling so low\n\nYou become your own worst enemy\n\nThinking that there's no hope, and your boat won't float\n\nThis is what she said, what she said to me\n\n\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo-one should be on their own\n\nLook at the horizon, cause love will always take you home\n\nShe said all hearts break, don't lost faith, you can't live life that way\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo-one should be on their own\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo man is an Island\n\n\n\nI'm a thousand miles from yesterday\n\nNow I'm living like a castaway\n\nJust a broken man on the shore\n\nStill hurting from the one before\n\n\n\nCause when you go solo, end up feeling so low\n\nYou become your own worst enemy\n\nThinking that there's no hope, and your boat won't float\n\nThis is what she said, what she said to me\n\n\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo-one should be on their own\n\nLook at the horizon, cause love will always take you home\n\nShe said all hearts break, don't lost faith, you can't live life that way\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo-one should be on their own\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo man is an Island\n\n\n\nI know there's plenty more fish in the sea\n\nBut only sharks circle me\n\nAnd when my heart was buried in the sand\n\nYou came along and took my hand\n\nI know there's plenty more fish in the sea\n\nBut only sharks circle me\n\nAnd when my heart was buried in the sand\n\nYou came along and took my hand, made me understand\n\n\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo-one should be on their own\n\nLook at the horizon, cause love will always take you home\n\nShe said all hearts break, don't lost faith, you can't live life that way\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo-one should be on their own\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo man is an Island\n\nNo one should be on their own\n\nNo man is an Island"
