  "lyrics": "Who are you if not the one I met\r\nOne July night before the town went wet\r\nJack and coke in your mama's car\r\nYou were reading The Bell Jar\n\nWhere are you if you're not on your own\n\nAlways lonely, never quite alone\n\nWhere's the Jesus that you swore you'd find\n\nAfter running the last line\n\n\n\nAre you living the life you chose\n\nAre you living the life that chose you\n\nAre you taking a grown up dose\n\nDo you live with a man who knows you\n\nLike I thought I did back then\n\nBut I guess I never did\n\nDid I kid?\n\n\n\nI got lucky when I finished school\n\nLost three fingers to a faulty tool\n\nSettled out of court, I'm no one's fool\n\nYou probably knew\n\n\n\nThere's plenty left to make a getaway\n\nI've spent enough nights in the bluegrass state\n\nWe could go somewhere where people stay up late\n\nOr just somewhere new\n\n\n\nAre you living the life you chose\n\nAre you living the life that chose you\n\nAre you taking a grown up dose\n\nDo you live with a man who knows you\n\nLike I thought I did back then\n\nBut I guess I never did\n\nDid I kid?\n\n\n\nHere I am inviting you to throw your life away\n\nVictim of nostalgia maybe take away\n\nJust tonight I realized that I am still in your backseat\n\nNothing I've had since has meant a thing to me\n\n\n\nAre you living the life you chose\n\nAre you living the life that chose you\n\nAre you taking a grown up dose\n\nDo you live with a man who knows you\n\nLike I thought I did back then\n\nBut I guess I never did\n\nDid I kid?"
