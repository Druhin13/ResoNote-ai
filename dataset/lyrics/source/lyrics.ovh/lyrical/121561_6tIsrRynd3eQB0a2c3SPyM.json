  "lyrics": "In the champagne drought I lost my mind\r\nSo I started smoking cigarettes with boxed wine\r\nWhen I made a sound, my neighbors cried\r\nSaid all my songs sound just like drunken lullabies\r\nSaid I couldn't change, so I broke the mold\r\nAnd I put my dreams in bottles knowing they would float\n\nTo a better place where I could be myself\n\nDon't wanna be another blonde doll on the shelf\n\n\n\nEvery day all day\n\nEvery day all day\n\nAh-a, ah-a-ah-a\n\nI hear choirs in my head\n\nThey won't stop until I'm dead\n\nAh-a, every day all day\n\nAh-a-ah-a, every day all day\n\nI hear choirs in my head, in my head\n\n\n\nAnd I like to think they're all my friends\n\nWhen I fall apart they put me back together again\n\nIt's like they see and understand\n\nEvery day, all day, every day when\n\nPeople show their teeth, don't bite your tongue\n\nBaby, you're a diamond shining with no lights on\n\nIf it gives you peace, keep raising hell\n\n\n\nEvery day all day\n\nEvery day all day\n\nAh-a, ah-a-ah-a\n\nI hear choirs in my head\n\nThey won't stop until I'm dead\n\nAh-a, every day all day\n\nAh-a-ah-a, every day all day\n\nI hear choirs in my head, in my head\n\nAh-a, ah-a-ah-a\n\nI hear choirs in my head\n\nThey won't stop until I'm dead\n\nAh-a, every day all day\n\nAh-a-ah-a, every day all day\n\nI hear choirs in my head, in my head\n\n\n\nI finally got what I wanted\n\nYeah, I think that I found the way\n\nI finally got what I needed\n\nWith the voices I have in my brain (1, 2)\n\n\n\nAh-a, ah-a-ah-a\n\nI hear choirs in my head\n\nThey won't stop until I'm dead\n\nAh-a, every day all day\n\nAh-a-ah-a, every day all day\n\nI hear choirs in my head, in my head\n\nAh-a, every day all day\n\nAh-a-ah-a, every day all day\n\nI hear choirs in my head\n\nThey won't stop until I'm dead\n\nAh-a, every day all day\n\nAh-a-ah-a, every day all day\n\nI hear choirs in my head, in my head"
