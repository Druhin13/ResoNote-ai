  "lyrics": "Dressed up like I'm going out, I feel it and I turn\r\nEmpty out my pockets for a tab to soften up the burn\r\nSo I walk in little circles rung around just like a bell\r\nMaybe I could feel better with some people that I know so well\r\nLet me be here all night long\n\nLet me be\n\nLet me be here all night long\n\nJust another night outside\n\nLet me be here all night long\n\nTurn another light off\n\nLet me be\n\nLet me be here all\n\n\n\nLarry's saying something, Keith is living on a smile\n\nSalu's quiet in the middle, holding on and feeling tired\n\nWell I guess it's been a while, we could probably go home\n\nAnd I know that she'll be fast asleep and I'll be all alone (Oh well)\n\n\n\nLet me be here all night long\n\nLet me be\n\nLet me be here all night long\n\nJust another night outside\n\nLet me be here all night long\n\nTurn another light off\n\nLet me be\n\nLet me be here all"
