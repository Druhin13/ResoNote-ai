  "lyrics": "Am I cursed, or did I do this to myself?\r\nCircling around and around\r\nLike a sain't that never closes its eyes\r\nYou deny with your hands held tight\r\nYou avoided light\n\nI drank from the cup of eternal disease\n\nI once was a blind man but now I can see\n\n\n\nI should've known you were the lord of flies\n\nLooking for heaven in the devil's eyes\n\nGuiding the stars to pave my own demise\n\nI should've known you were the lord of flies\n\n\n\nYou're the worst, but I can see you in myself\n\nBroken but enough is enough\n\nJust a wretch that never opens its eyes\n\nYou deny with a voice so loud permeating the night\n\n\n\nI drank from the cup of eternal disease\n\nI once was a blind man but now I can see\n\nI'll never forgive, no I'll never concede\n\nThe worst that you've done's still got nothing on me\n\n\n\nI should've known you were the lord of flies\n\nLooking for heaven in the devil's eyes\n\nGuiding the stars to pave my own demise\n\nI should've known you were the lord of flies\n\n\n\nI should've known you fill my head with lies\n\nI was looking for heaven in the devil's eyes\n\n\n\nI should've known you were the lord of flies\n\nLooking for heaven in the devil's eyes\n\nGuiding the stars to pave my own demise\n\nI should've known you were the lord of flies\n\n\n\nLord of flies"
