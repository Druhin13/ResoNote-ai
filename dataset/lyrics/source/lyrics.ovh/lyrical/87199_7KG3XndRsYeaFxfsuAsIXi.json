(till the end!)\n\n\n\nI realize that without you!\n\nI'm alone until the end!\n\nYou've been right by my side!\n\nAlways there again and again!\n\n\n\n[x2]\n\nThere is no place I would rather be!\n\nYou're on my mind, every moment of every day!\n\nBut I can't find the words to say!\n\n\n\n[x2]\n\nAll I need to know is you!\n\nI don't want to miss a thing!\n\nEverybody knows and everybody sees!\n\nYou are the best of me!\n\n\n\nCan it be you and me?\n\nSooner or later?\n\nCan it be?\n\nCan it be?\n\n\n\nCan it be you and me?\n\nSooner or later?\n\nI swear I will wait till the end! (till the end!)\n\nCan it be you and me?\n\nSooner or later?\n\nI swear I will wait till the end! (till the end!)\n\nCan it be you and me?\n\nSooner or later?\n\nI swear I will wait till the end! (till the end!)\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Blaike for these lyrics)"
