  "lyrics": "Baby, we used to drive in your car\r\nWhat happened to us?\r\nYeah, we didn't make it very far\r\nI never thought that we would end up like this\r\nUntil you gave me your last kiss\r\nWe slept on the floor all night\n\nI fell in love with you as the seconds went by\n\nCan you tell me just what changed your mind?\n\n\n\n'Cause you were obsessed with me like we were 17\n\nAnd you struggled to keep your hands off me\n\nBut now look at us now\n\nSomehow we drowned\n\n\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nWon't you give me one last night?\n\nWith you, with you\n\n\n\nIt's been 3 months now, can we talk it out?\n\nHow you left me standing outside the front of your house\n\nSaw you through the window crying on the stairs\n\nI thought you didn't care\n\n\n\nI just wanna pull you close\n\nBut there's walls in-between\n\nCan't we just go back to when we were 17?\n\n\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nWon't you give me one last night?\n\nWith you, with you\n\n\n\nI lie awake and think how we used to be, we used to be\n\nAnd you'd do all the little things that make me weak\n\nThey made me weak\n\n\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nWon't you give me one last night with you?\n\n\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nWon't you give me one last night?\n\nWith you, with you\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nI just want you one more time\n\nWon't you give me one last night?\n\nWith you, with you"
