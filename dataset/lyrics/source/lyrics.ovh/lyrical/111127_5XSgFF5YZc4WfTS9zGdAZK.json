  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson dread par nothing,nowhere.\r\nI look into the mirror, all I'm seeing is a skeleton\nI keep losing weight, so they got me taking medicine\nI can't go a day without relying on these sedatives\nTherapy and doctors, I feel like a specimen\nEvery fucking night that I've been laying in my bed\nDoing all I can to fight the certain sense of dread\nFeeling like this panic that I have will never end\nAnd so I fantasize about that gun up to my head, yeah\nAnd now these pills got me feeling asleep\n\nWhen I'm awake, can't get away\nEven when I sleep I feel pain\nVivid visions in the past creeping into my brain\nAbout to break, I just want to feel like I'm sane, yeah\nAnd I just want to know what I did\nDo I deserve this, like why I gotta deal with this shit, man\nAnd I just wanna know when it happened\nWhen I lost my mind and will I ever truly feel happy, motherfucker\n\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nWalking around with the same thoughts\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nFace down, fucked up with the door locked\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nWalking around with the same thoughts\n\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nFace down, fucked up with the door locked\n\nI've been fighting this with everything that I have\nAnd I've been trying to separate the good from the bad\nWell, I can't see an end to all the pain that I face\nI had to cancel the tour, I couldn't take any more\nI feel the weight of expectation pressing down on my chest\nI feel like everybody has their own belief of what's best\nMeditation, medication, should I pray to a god?\nI refuse to let this win and be consumed by my thoughts\n\n\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nI wanna know when the pain stops\n\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nWalking around with the same thoughts\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nFace down, fucked up with the door locked\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nWalking around with the same thoughts\nI wanna know when the pain stops\nFace down, fucked up with the door locked"
