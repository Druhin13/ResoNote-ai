  "lyrics": "The wind is warm, the streets are soft\r\nPeople are laughing\r\nThe city's rain, the river's free\r\nOh my darling\r\nThe lights are on the boulevard and the cafes\n\nThe sidewalk is trembling, the moon is out\n\nAnd busses are running\n\n\n\nCome on darling let's get lost\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nOr maybe we are too alone\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nOut to celebrate our love\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nDance the night away 'til dusk\n\n\n\nThe gun, the station is polite\n\nAnd we are old\n\nThe crowd is leaving, and they're laughing\n\nAnd they are singing, too\n\n\n\nOne look into my eyes\n\nSee what's that look in yours\n\nCome see me dancing\n\nAlong the sand\n\n\n\nCome on darling let's get lost\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nOr maybe we are too alone\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nOut to celebrate our love\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nDance the night away 'til dusk\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\n\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nOut to celebrate our love!\n\n(Let's go out more often)\n\nDance the night away 'til dusk"
