  "lyrics": "Feeling the breeze of change\r\nLethargy rolls over me again\r\nLike sap over a midge\r\nIs it real or just pretend?\r\nIt's alive in the dark \nAnd it knows where I'm going to be \n\nForever returning again and again\n\nInto the house \n\nInto the den\n\n\n\nElastic stretched and strained\n\nI know I could change\n\nThis shirt is ripped and stained \n\nAnd your pushing familiar drugs again \n\n\n\nYou're pushing it\n\nI can't resist\n\nI feel you under my skin \n\nPushing familiar drugs again\n\n\n\nFeeling the turning tides \n\nIndifference takes hold again\n\nLike mist over the lake\n\nIs it real or is it fake?\n\nI'll go with the gravity\n\nLet the current take me where it please \n\nRight down the fucking drain\n\nInto my lungs \n\nInto my veins\n\n\n\nElastic stretched and strained\n\nI know I could change\n\nThis shirt is ripped and stained \n\nAnd you're pushing familiar drugs again \n\n\n\nYou're pushing it\n\nI can't resist\n\nI feel you under my skin \n\nPushing familiar drugs again\n\n\n\nYou're pushing it\n\nI can't resist\n\nI feel you under my skin \n\nPushing familiar drugs again\n\n\n\nYou're pushing familiar drugs\n\nYou're pushing familiar drugs again\n\nYou keep pushing familiar drugs\n\nYou keep pushing familiar drugs again and again"
