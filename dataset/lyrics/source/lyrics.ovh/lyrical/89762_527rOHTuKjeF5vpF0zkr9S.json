  "title": "Paralyzed",
  "lyrics": "The anger, the pressure\r\nYou're choking down your words again\r\nFeel the nerves set in\r\nUnspoken frustration\r\nThey see right through you\r\nPaper thin, like the ghost within\n\n\n\nA heart that feels no pain\n\nAddicted to the game\n\nBreaking beneath the strain\n\nI am paralyzed\n\n\n\nThe stare of a stranger\n\nIs like a wound that bleeds again\n\nSilent as the dead\n\nThe victim, the martyr\n\nLike Daniel in the lion's den\n\nTime and time again\n\n\n\nA heart that feels no pain\n\nAddicted to the game\n\nBreaking beneath the strain\n\nI am paralyzed\n\nI am paralyzed\n\n\n\n\n\nA heart that feels no pain\n\nAddicted to the game\n\nRelentless mental trait?\n\nWhat do you stand to gain?\n\nViewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens\n\nWe'll ensure you end up on the losing end\n\nBreaking beneath the string\n\nI am paralyzed\n\nI am paralyzed\n\nI am paralyzed\n\nI am paralyzed\n\nI am paralyzed"
