Gucci Mane]\r\nHoliday season!\r\nPyong! catch up!\r\nIt's gucci!\n\nI'm in the yellow thang on the expressway\n\nThat bitch so nasty it might give a bitch road rage\n\nGet out my lane: ferrari boyz\n\nYou see the chain: so icey boyz\n\nI'm running in a mansion but I don't think I'm fancy\n\nBut I cut the blinker on and my diamonds dancing\n\nOnce upon a time, a little while ago\n\nThere was a nigga in a \"rari with a pretty yellow ho\n\nGot my head held up cause I think I'm handsome\n\nBut the media portraying me as charles manson\n\nAnd I cut up?\n\nBut I'd rather pull up solo in the yellow 2-seater\n\nGucci!\n\n\n\nGet out my lane! ferrari boyz\n\nYou see the chain: so icey boyz\n\n\n\nRiding in the 'rari same color as bacardi\n\nShe don't like me, shawty, man she like my car\n\nDamn near wanna fuck my chain, damn near wanna fuck my name\n\n[?]\n\nDeep-dish rims on my horses, mane\n\nThat's how me and gucci mane claim\n\nIced out?\n\nHow our bandana's like santana's, screaming out\n\n\"Who wants some banner? \"\n\nHit a million off my words, they love my country grammar\n\nThat's the antenna, but your rapping careers got static in it\n\nI'm a walking meal ticket, just wait a minute\n\nBank account got commas in it\n\nAll that while? was in it\n\nI hear em talking gangsta shit but I know they lame as hell\n\nOne thing I ain't gon?\n\nPussy nigga you sweet as hell\n\nMy name ring bells, my engine loud as hell\n\nShit, my 'rari cost about 230 bills...\n\n\n\nBrick squad monopoly, that's my company\n\nBitch I'm buying all the property..."
