  "lyrics": "I may not know an awful lot but one thing that I’m sure about\r\nLife is better now that I’ve found you\r\nYou and coffee in the morning is all I need is all I need\r\nI got a perfect view\r\nBecause even when I say no I mean yes\n\nAnd even when I’m right it’s my secret\n\nI say I’m going to go but not leaving\n\nI need to feel your love like a bee sting\n\nSo lately I’ve been feeling different\n\nIf feels like now we barely kissing\n\nIs it me?\n\nSometimes I feel that you don’t listen\n\nYou next to me but you're still missing\n\nYour all I need\n\n\n\nI may not know an awful lot but one thing that I’m sure about\n\nLife is better now that I’ve found you\n\nYou and coffee in the morning is all I need is all I need\n\nI wanna wake up with you\n\nYou and coffee in the morning is all I need is all I need\n\nI got a perfect view\n\n\n\nTo me girl you could do no wrong. You’re the reason why sing this song. Now wishing I could read your mind. Professor X until you’re mine\n\nYour all\n\nI need\n\nWaking up to different landscapes looking at the view\n\nMorning coffee with some pancakes, Belgian waffles to\n\nEverything I said I meant it. Cuando despierte. Tú y cafecito caliente. Is all need\n\n\n\nSo love me tender love me long\n\nBaby love me sweet love me strong\n\nBecause life is better now that I’ve found you\n\nSo love me tender love me long\n\nBaby love me sweet love me strong\n\nBecause life is better now that I’ve found you\n\n\n\nYou and coffee in the morning is all I need is all I need\n\nI wanna wake up with you\n\nYou and coffee in the morning is all I need is all I need\n\nI got a perfect view\n\nCafecito in the morning"
