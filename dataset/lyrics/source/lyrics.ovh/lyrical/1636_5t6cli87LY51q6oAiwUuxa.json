  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ace Hood - Speaks (Interlude) par Ace Hood\r\nLoyalty ain't just when it's convenient\nLike loyalty ain't when it's convenient\nThat's why I said what I said\nPeople scream \"loyalty loyalty\" but if he ain't give that back, he ain't create that opportunity\nWould you still be loyal to him?\nYou probably wouldn't, you know what I mean?\nBut it's convenient for you at that time to be, to do so\nSo you gon play your part, play the position\nI'm just looking to connect with motherfuckers that creative\nAnd I just wanna build some shit, not only for themselves but wanna build together, like build this thing that's incredible\n'Cause it all starts from here\n\nYou know, I look at Dre and all the people who in the creditable have done it before in the past\nLike it started from ideas and somebody believed\nA few people believe and say \"I will do this\""
