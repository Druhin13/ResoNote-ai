  "lyrics": "I drive deep in the valley so the stars can shine\r\nI was hoping to trip with a friend of me\r\nBut my friend's in trouble with the boys in blue\r\nA mercurial tribe who decide what's true\r\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\nI'm gonna lose my cool looking in the rearview\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\n\n\nI came back to the city with an open heart\n\nIt swallowed me up with all its boyish charm\n\nBut the charm won't last past the strike of the night\n\nI have to let it all out before I lose this fight\n\n\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\nI'm gonna lose my cool looking in the rearview\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\n\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\nGirl you gotta leave, you gotta let it go\n\n\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low\n\nI'm gonna lose my cool looking in the rearview\n\nI'm gonna let go of feeling low"
