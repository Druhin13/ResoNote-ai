  "lyrics": "My heart run around in my chest\r\nEven in my bed there’s no rest\r\nYour voice is so loud\r\nAnd nobody hears that sound but me\r\nI hope I don’t drown\r\nMy air is trying to leave\n\nTry to breathe for a second\n\nMake believe for a second (it’s all in your mind)\n\nThat it’ll be alright, alright, alright, alright, alright\n\nThat it’ll be alright, alright, alright, alright, alright\n\nThat it’ll be alright, alright\n\n\n\nAnxiety is fear mixed with control, when you can't control something the only thing left to do is to rage\n\n\n\nI was feeling like my career was done\n\nI was feeling like I was washed up\n\nSee I got on that bus and I said I'm gonna make this just for song for me\n\nAnd I don't care if nobody like it\n\nAnd I had no producers on the road and so I said no I'm not gonna wait on anybody\n\nI'm gonna make this beat myself\n\nThen I had this little melody idea and it came to my mind and I recorded it with my voice duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, and it went like this"
