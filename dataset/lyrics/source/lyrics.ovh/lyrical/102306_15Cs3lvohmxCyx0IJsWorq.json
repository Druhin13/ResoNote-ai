Are we out of line?\r\nNever get it back, never see it shine\r\nKeep on holding on, lifting an inch around\r\nOld spot looking like a ghost town\n\nDollar to my name, still I'm going out\n\n'Cause I think I see better when the sun's down\n\n\n\nIt's you and me, yeah, you and me\n\nWe popped some shit and took a ride on some truancy\n\nWe fantasize about our lives and the jewelry\n\nThat we might one day get\n\nWe got it but now truthfully, truthfully\n\n\n\nI feel, I feel better when I'm broken\n\nYeah, I feel better when I'm lonely\n\nI feel better with no money, oh\n\nI feel, I feel better when I'm broken\n\nYeah, I feel better when I'm lonely\n\nI feel better with no money, oh\n\n\n\nNothing was the same back in fourteen\n\nFeel like I got traded from the home team\n\nSo my look on there was an old dream\n\nBut oh my God, almost had the whole thing\n\nReally want the high with no come down\n\nHaven't left the house for a month now\n\nFeeling, feeling right, watch me come around\n\n'Cause I think I see better when the sun's down\n\n\n\nIt's you and me, yeah, you and me\n\nWe popped some shit and took a ride on some truancy\n\nWe fantasize about our lives and the jewelry\n\nThat we might one day get\n\nWe got it but now truthfully, truthfully\n\n\n\nI feel, I feel better when I'm broken\n\nYeah, I feel better when I'm lonely\n\nI feel better with no money, oh\n\nI feel, I feel better when I'm broken\n\nYeah, I feel better when I'm lonely\n\nI feel better with no money, oh"
