(Blue)\n\nWhen you know, I've been in love since like 2002\n\nAnd I'm like boo\n\nWhy you, always, hit me, out of the blue?\n\nWhen you know, I've been crushin' since like 2002\n\n\n\nYou hit me always, always, always, always out of the blue, out of the blue?\n\nWhy you hit me always, always, always, always out of the blue, out of the blue?"
