  "lyrics": "The child was born\r\nInto a world of love\r\nInto a world of pain\r\nInto the night\r\nInto the sun and rain\n\nThe child was torn\n\nBetween the black and white\n\nBetween the wrong and right\n\nBetween despair\n\nAnd pure delight\n\n\n\nThe child of mysteries\n\nThe child of lies\n\nThe party never dies\n\n\n\nThe child is found\n\nBeyond the rise and fall\n\nBeyond the in and out\n\nBeyond our faith\n\nAnd all our doubt\n\n\n\nThe child is crowned\n\nIn a halo of gold\n\nA vision to behold\n\nLife unrestrained\n\nAnd uncontrolled\n\n\n\nThe child of mysteries\n\nThe child of lies\n\nThe party never dies"
