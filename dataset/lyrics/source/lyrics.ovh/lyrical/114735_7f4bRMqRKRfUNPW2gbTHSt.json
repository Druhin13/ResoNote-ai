  "lyrics": "Let me introduce you to the voices in my head\r\nThey misbehave with every chance they get\r\nThe pain is real, my laughter is pretend\r\nSo I light the matches, ready to forget\r\nAnd I spark up the fire\n\nAnd things feel a bit brighter\n\nBut not quite how I like it\n\nSo I get a bit higher\n\n\n\nSo won't you save me from myself right now\n\n'Cause you know I need your help right now, right now\n\nSo won't you save me from myself right now, right now\n\n'Cause I feel like someone else, somehow\n\n\n\nStill it's 48 hours without rest\n\nBurning sensation in my chest\n\nNever would admit that I'm depressed\n\n'Cause I was raised to take the bitter with a twist\n\n\n\nSo I spark up the fire\n\nAnd things feel a bit brighter\n\nBut not quite how I like it\n\nSo I get a bit higher\n\n\n\nSo won't you save me from myself right now, right now\n\n'Cause you know I need your help right now, right now\n\nSo won't you save me from myself right now, right now\n\n'Cause I feel like someone else, somehow, somehow\n\n\n\n'Cause I miss myself, yeah I miss myself, have you seen me\n\nYeah I miss that man that I was back then, have you see him\n\n'Cause I miss myself, yeah I miss myself, have you seen me\n\nYeah I miss that man that I was back then, have you see him\n\n\n\nSo won't you save me from myself right now\n\n'Cause you know I need your help right now, right now\n\nWon't you save me from myself right now, right now\n\n'Cause I feel like someone else, somehow, somehow"
