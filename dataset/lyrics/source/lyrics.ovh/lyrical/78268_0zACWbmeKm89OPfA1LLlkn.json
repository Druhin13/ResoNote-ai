  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson You Turned The Tables On Me par Louis Armstrong\r\nYou turned the tables on me\nAnd now I'm falling for you;\nYou turned the tables on me\nI can't believe that it's true\nI always thought when you brought\nThe lovely present you bought\nWhy hadn't you brought me more\nBut now if you'd come\nI'd welcome anything\nFrom the five and ten cent store\n\nYou used to call me the top\nYou put me up on a throne\nYou let me fall with a drop\nAnd now I'm out on my own\nBut after thinking it over and over\n\nI got what was coming to me\nJust like the sting of a bee\nYou turned the tables on me\n\nI used to be the apple of your eye\nI had you with me every day\nBut now whenever you are passing by\nYou're always looking the other way\nIt's little things like this\nThat prompt me to say:\n\nYou turned the tables on me\nAnd now I'm falling for you;\nYou turned the tables on me\nI can't believe that it's true\nI always thought when you brought\nThe lovely present you bought\nWhy hadn't you brought me more\n\nBut now if you'd come\nI'd welcome anything\nFrom the five and ten cent store\n\nYou used to call me the top\nYou put me up on a throne\nYou let me fall with a drop\nAnd now I'm out on my own\nBut after thinking it over and over\nI got what was coming to me\nJust like the sting of a bee\nYou turned the tables on me"
