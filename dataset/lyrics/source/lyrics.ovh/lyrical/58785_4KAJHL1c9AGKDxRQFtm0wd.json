  "lyrics": "I saved every letter you wrote me\r\nFrom the moment I read them\r\nI knew you were mine\r\nYou said you were mine\r\nI thought you were mine\n\nDo you know what Angelica said\n\nWhen we saw your first letter arrive?\n\nShe said\n\n\n\n“Be careful with that one, love\n\nHe will do what it takes to survive.”\n\n\n\nYou and your words flooded my senses\n\nYour sentences left me defenseless\n\nYou built me palaces out of paragraphs\n\nYou built cathedrals\n\nI’m re-reading the letters you wrote me\n\nI’m searching and scanning for answers\n\nIn every line\n\nFor some kind of sign\n\nAnd when you were mine\n\nThe world seemed to\n\n\n\nBurn\n\nBurn\n\n\n\nYou published the letters she wrote you\n\nYou told the whole world how you brought\n\nThis girl into our bed\n\nIn clearing your name, you have ruined our lives\n\nDo you know what Angelica said\n\nWhen she read what you’d done?\n\nShe said\n\n“You have married an Icarus\n\nHe has flown too close to the sun.”\n\n\n\nYou and your words, obsessed with your legacy...\n\nYour sentences border on senseless\n\nAnd you are paranoid in every paragraph\n\nHow they perceive you\n\n\n\nYou, you, you…\n\n\n\nI’m erasing myself from the narrative\n\nLet future historians wonder how Eliza\n\nReacted when you broke her heart\n\nYou have torn it all apart\n\nI am watching it\n\nBurn\n\nWatching it burn\n\nThe world has no right to my heart\n\nThe world has no place in our bed\n\nThey don’t get to know what I said\n\nI’m burning the memories\n\nBurning the letters that might have redeemed you\n\nYou forfeit all rights to my heart\n\nYou forfeit the place in our bed\n\nYou sleep in your office instead\n\nWith only the memories\n\nOf when you were mine\n\nI hope that you burn"
