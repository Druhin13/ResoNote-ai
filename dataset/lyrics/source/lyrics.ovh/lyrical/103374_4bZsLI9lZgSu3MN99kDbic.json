  "lyrics": "I'm a little bit a ball cap\r\nLittle bit a pearl snap button down shirt\r\nLittle bit a big city concrete\r\nBut a lot more small town dirt\r\nI can see your pretty eyes\n\nReading me like a map\n\nWondering who I am\n\nAnd where I'm at\n\n\n\nI'm in between\n\nFriday night wild\n\nAnd quiet Sunday morning\n\nBetween\n\nDone after one\n\nAnd keep on pouring\n\nAin't too high\n\nAin't too low\n\nJust holding down the middle\n\nI'm steady as I go\n\nI ain't all holy water\n\nAnd I ain't all Jim Beam\n\nI'm somewhere in between\n\n\n\nI can be a steel toe work boot\n\n40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans\n\nThen on weekend pack a bag\n\nDisappear kick back on a white sand beach\n\n\n\nI'm a far cry from being\n\nA one night stand\n\nBut I ain't ready\n\nFor a ring on my hand\n\n\n\nI'm in between\n\nFriday night wild\n\nAnd quiet Sunday morning\n\nBetween\n\nDone after one\n\nAnd keep on pouring\n\nAin't too high\n\nAin't too low\n\nJust holding down the middle\n\nI'm steady as I go\n\nI ain't all holy water\n\nAnd I ain't all Jim Beam\n\nI'm somewhere in between\n\n\n\nI can see your pretty eyes\n\nReading me like a map\n\nWondering who I am\n\nAnd where I'm at\n\n\n\nI'm in between\n\nFriday night wild\n\nAnd quiet Sunday morning\n\nBetween\n\nDone after one\n\nAnd keep on pouring\n\nAin't too high\n\nAin't too low\n\nJust holding down the middle\n\nI'm steady as I go\n\nI ain't all holy water\n\nAnd I ain't all Jim Beam\n\nI'm somewhere in between\n\nYeah I'm somewhere in between"
