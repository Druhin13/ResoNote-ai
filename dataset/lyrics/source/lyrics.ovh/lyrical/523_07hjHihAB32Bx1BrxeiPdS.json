  "title": "Mandalay",
  "lyrics": "I traced the footsteps through the multi-colored avenues\rThat wind their way down to the sea\rI see the birds that fly beneath the darkened sky\rThey are the messengers of dreams\rMandalay, now I know what you try to be\rMandalay, now I wish you were here with me\rPages filled with science fiction\rWithout fear of contradiction\rWalking through the fields of evergreen\rI see a turn and walk away\rAnd from the east there comes a breeze\rThat flows up high into the blue\rMandalay, now I know what you try to be\rMandalay, now I wish you were here with me\rThe sound of retribution\rIn total disillusion, Mandalay\rMandalay, now I know what you try to be\rMandalay, now I wish you were here with me\rAdmidst the confusion\rThe only conclusion\rMandalay of the misty eyes\rHave gazed into the coming door\rThe leaves that turn to gold and brown\rI've watched them falling to the ground\rMandalay, now I know what you try to be\rMandalay, now I wish you were here with me"
