  "lyrics": "Help me, it's like the walls are caving in\r\nSometimes I feel like giving up\r\nBut I just can't\r\nIt isn't in my blood\r\nLaying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing\n\nI'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something\n\nI could take to ease my mind slowly\n\nJust have a drink and you'll feel better\n\nJust take her home and you'll feel better\n\nKeep telling me that it gets better\n\nDoes it ever?\n\n\n\nHelp me, it's like the walls are caving in\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up\n\nNo medicine is strong enough\n\nSomeone help me\n\nI'm crawling in my skin\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up\n\nBut I just can't\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\n\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\n\n\nLooking through my phone again, feeling anxious\n\nAfraid to be alone again, I hate this\n\nI'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh\n\nIs there somebody who could help me?\n\n\n\nIt's like the walls are caving in\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up\n\nNo medicine is strong enough\n\nSomeone help me\n\nI'm crawling in my skin\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up\n\nBut I just can't\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\n\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\n\n\nI need somebody now\n\nI need somebody now\n\nSomeone to help me out\n\nI need somebody now\n\n\n\nHelp me, it's like the walls are caving in\n\nSometimes I feel like giving up\n\nBut I just can't\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\n\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\nI need somebody now\n\nIt isn't in my blood\n\nI need somebody now\n\nIt isn't in my blood"
