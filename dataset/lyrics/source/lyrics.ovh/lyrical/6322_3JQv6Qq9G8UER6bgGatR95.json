  "lyrics": "God on a cross; who would have thought it?\r\nThis place looks nothing like Eden\r\nBut there is no death here in the ruins\r\nThis is the land of the breathing\r\nOut past the fear\n\nDoubt becomes wonder, doubt becomes wonder\n\nRivers appear\n\nAnd I'm going under, I'm going under!\n\n\n\nHere in the wild, my hands are empty\n\nAnd yet I've had all I needed\n\nThere is no drought here in the desert\n\nI've found a water that's living\n\n\n\nOut past the fear\n\nDoubt becomes wonder, doubt becomes wonder\n\nRivers appear\n\nAnd I'm going under, I'm going under!\n\n\n\nEvergreen, evergreen\n\nThe tree of life is evergreen\n\nEvergreen, evergreen\n\nThe tree of life is evergreen\n\nEvergreen, evergreen\n\nThe tree of life is evergreen\n\nEvergreen, evergreen\n\nThe tree of life is evergreen!"
