  "lyrics": "There's a serpent coiling around my neck\r\nThe adoring crescent moon in blazing night\r\nThe holy river Ganga flowing through my muddled hair\r\nIn the ancient times before I learned ov who I am\r\nIf I am a missing link between the pig and the divine\n\nI shall cast the pearls before the swine\n\n\n\nI am no good shepherd on an ox\n\nBut a solitude ov the loneliest star\n\nLike a 1000 shrines subsumed into the void\n\nLike a dead space in between the suns\n\n\n\nIs a God to live in a dog? No!\n\nBut the highest are of us\n\nIs a God to live in a dog? No!\n\nBut the highest are of us\n\n\n\nElohim ([children:] Elohim!)\n\nI shall not forgive!\n\nAdonai ([children:] Adonai!)\n\nI shall not forgive!\n\nLiving God ([children:] Living God!)\n\nI shall not the forgive!\n\nJesus Christ ([children:] Jesus Christ!)\n\nI forgive thee not!"
