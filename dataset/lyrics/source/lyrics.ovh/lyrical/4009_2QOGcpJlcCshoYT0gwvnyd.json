  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Love Made Me Do It par Ellise\r\nI plead the fifth\nCan't make me talk about, talk about shit\nIt's all on him\nI ain't responsible for all the blood shed\n\nDon't hate me, I know I'm the one you blame\nIt's nothing that I can control\nNothing that I can control\n\nLove made me do it, hands on my heart I swear\nLove made me do it, I couldn't stop myself\nHis name is on that bullet\nPleading sanity to it\nLove made me do it\nLove made me lose my mind\nLove made me lose my mind\n\nLove made me lose my mind\n\nWish I could stop\nBut this feeling has taken all control\nCan't keep this up\nSomebody lock me up, don't trust myself no more\n\nDon't hate me, I know I'm the one you blame\nIt's nothing that I can control\nNothing that I can control\n\nLove made me do it, hands on my heart I swear\nLove made me do it, I couldn't stop myself\nHis name is on that bullet\nPleading sanity to it\nLove made me do it\nLove made me lose my mind\nLove made me lose my mind\n\nLove made me lose my mind\n\nYou pulled me in this mess\nYou got inside my head\nSomehow I still want you\nYou pulled me in restraints\nLocked me in my own brain\nSomehow I still want you\n\nLove made me do it, hands on my heart I swear\nLove made me do it, I couldn't stop myself\nHis name is on that bullet\nPleading sanity to it\nLove made me do it\nLove made me lose my mind\nLove made me lose my mind\nLove made me lose my mind"
