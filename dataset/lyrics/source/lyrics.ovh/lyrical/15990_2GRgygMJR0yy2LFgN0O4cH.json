  "lyrics": "No more pain, no more love\r\nMy baby left for the world up above\r\nAnd no one saw her when she died\r\nMy baby died with no tears in her eyes\r\nOh, baby, baby, where will I go?\n\nThe bombs came down and destroyed my home\n\nOh, baby, baby, now that you're gone\n\nI'm sorry dear, I cannot go on\n\n\n\nAnd I take myself to the place where we fell\n\nIn love those nights before there was hell\n\nI did not know how free we were\n\nUntil you left in a ball of sulfur\n\n\n\nAnd like a man institutionalized\n\nI cannot live, so now I must die\n\nAnd the only way to see you again\n\nIs for my life to come to an end\n\n\n\nYes, I remember now, my wedding wine\n\nI'll drink some now, stop wasting my time\n\nJust a couple more will do the trick\n\nMore, more, yes that's it\n\n\n\nYes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\nOh soon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\nYes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\nSoon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\n\n\nYes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\nSoon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\nYes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon\n\nSoon, soon, I'll be with you soon"
