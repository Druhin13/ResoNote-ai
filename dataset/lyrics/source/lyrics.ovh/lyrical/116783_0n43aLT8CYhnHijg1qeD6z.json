  "lyrics": "Left her heart in a letter\r\nSaid she'd never been better\r\nBut now I know\r\nMy original sin\r\nShe is down once again\r\nNo, no\n\n\n\nIt's been so long\n\nCan't remember the last time, you know\n\nIt's been so long\n\nSo I'm on my way\n\n\n\nI can't see the road through the driving rain\n\nBut I won't stop now\n\nHer love is calling me home, seems to guide the way\n\nSo I won't stop now\n\n\n\nTo avoid all confusion\n\nShe said she's been using\n\nNo, not again\n\nOh, but my fear of losing\n\nThe girl always gets me home\n\n'Cause she knows\n\n\n\nIt's been so long\n\nStill some things will never change, I know\n\nIt's been so long\n\nSo I'm on my way\n\n\n\nI can't see the road through the driving rain\n\nBut I won't stop now\n\nHer love is calling me home, seems to guide the way\n\nSo I won't stop now\n\n\n\nShe's the dark to light\n\nShe's never satisfied\n\nShe always seems to find a reason to hope\n\nThat I'll come back tonight\n\nThat I will wanna rise\n\nShe pulled my strings yet again\n\nSo, here we go\n\n\n\nI can't see the road through the driving rain\n\nBut I won't stop now\n\nHer love is calling me home, seems to guide the way\n\nSo I won't stop now\n\nI can't see the road through the driving rain\n\nBut I won't stop now\n\nHer love is calling me home, seems to guide the way\n\nSo I won't stop now\n\n\n\nAnd I won't stop now\n\nSo I won't stop now"
