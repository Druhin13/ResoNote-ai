  "lyrics": "The first thing that you said when I picked up the phone was I missed my chance to say goodbye. I'm too weak for guilt trips. I'll live with this knowledge for the rest of my life\r\nI just can't remember the last thing that we spoke about, the last thing that we did, or the last time I told you I loved you. Well, I loved you\r\nTake me where you are, please take me where you are, 'cause I don't want to live in this world without you. I wish I could wake you from your slumber\n\nI know you wanted more. I know you wanted more from me\n\n\n\nIt's not what I want; saw you burn up in flames. Now I stare at your ashes and wish I was taking your place"
