  "lyrics": "Back is aching but I cannot sleep\r\n'Cause I want to be like I am the mayor of some godforsaken town\r\nSure, they knighted me yesterday\r\nBut who needs armor when I've an exoskeleton?\r\nI slip and squirm through the cracks\r\nCreep around by all the loading zones in my dirty little town\n\nGet my shopping done, laundry too\n\nDrop some dead weight, clean my hands of what I need to clean my hands of\n\nAnd all for free by mayoral decree\n\nAll from zone to loading zone of my town, yeah\n\n\n\nThree grumpy girls and a dying daddy\n\nBut oh so gorgeous the way they crave\n\nHow beautiful to take a bite out of the world\n\nI want to rip the world a new one\n\nIt just crawls out of my mouth anymore\n\nYou can hate on it or you can hug it\n\nYou can get all mushy and lovey-dovey\n\nIt's all the same when I'm out there driving around\n\nAll from zone to loading zone of my beautiful town\n\n\n\nI park for free\n\nOne stop shop life for the quick fix\n\nBefore you get a ticket\n\nThat's the way I live my life\n\nI park for free\n\n\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free\n\nI park for free"
