  "lyrics": "Hey, how have you been since you let in?\r\nThe clouds through your window as it rained\r\nThe last time we spoke\r\nYou were glued to that telescope\r\nI heard you say it was too far away\r\nWas it too far away? Mmm, mm\n\n\n\nMe, I’ve been fine\n\nI work most of the time\n\nDigging for secrets deep in the ground\n\nA few days ago\n\nThey called for that big snow\n\nMan, I thought that I would never get warm\n\nDid you ever get warm? Mmm, mm\n\n\n\nAll inside the rain\n\nWe carry what we’re able\n\nAmong the sewer rats and angels\n\nAnd all of us in between\n\n\n\nBefore I go, I’ll leave you with this poem\n\nAbout the galvanised moon and her rings in the rain"
