  "lyrics": "Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty \nThe broken rose with laughin' eyes \nYou're a mystery, always runnin' wild \nLike a child without a home \nYou're always searching, searching for a feeling \nThat it's easy come and easy go \n\n\n\nOh I'm sorry but it's true \n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nTakin' all the best of me \n\nOh can't you see? \n\nYou got the best of me \n\nWhoah can't you see? \n\n\n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\nCan't you see? \n\n\n\nOh whoah \n\nYou're such a secret, misty eyed and shady \n\nLady how you hold the key \n\nOh you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin' \n\nBurnin' out and burnin' me \n\n\n\nCan't you see? \n\nJust try and say to you \n\n\n\nYou're bringin' on the heartache \n\nTakin' all the best of me \n\nOh can't you see? \n\nYou got the best of me \n\nWhoah can't you see? \n\n\n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\n\n\nCan't you see? \n\nCan't you see? \n\nNo no no \n\nYou got the best of me \n\nOh can't you see? \n\nYou got the best of me \n\nWhoah can't you see? \n\n\n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak \n\nBringin' on the heartache \n\nYou're bringin' on the heartbreak"
