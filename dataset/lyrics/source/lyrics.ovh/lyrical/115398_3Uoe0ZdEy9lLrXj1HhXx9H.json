  "lyrics": "You got a fast car\r\nI want a ticket to anywhere\r\nMaybe we'll make a deal\r\nMaybe together we can get somewhere\r\nAny place is better\r\nStarting from zero, got nothing to lose\n\nMaybe we'll make something\n\nMe myself I got nothing to prove\n\n\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nI got a plan to get us out of here\n\nI been working at the convenience store\n\nManaged to save just a little bit of money\n\nWon't have to drive too far\n\nJust 'cross the border and into the city\n\nYou and I can both get jobs\n\nAnd finally see what it means to be living\n\n\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\n\nWe gotta make a decision\n\nLeave tonight or live and die this way\n\n\n\nSo remember when we were driving, driving in your car\n\nSpeed so fast I felt like I was drunk\n\nCity lights lay out before us\n\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\n\nAnd I had, had a feeling that I belonged\n\nI had, had a feeling that I could be someone\n\nHad a feeling that I could be someone\n\n\n\nSee, my old man's got a problem\n\nHe live with the bottle that's the way it is\n\nHe says his body's too old for working\n\nHis body's too young to look like his\n\nMy mama went off and left him\n\nShe wanted more from life than he could give\n\nI said somebody's got to take care of him\n\nSo I quit school and that's what I did\n\n\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nWe go cruising, entertain ourselves\n\nYou still ain't got a job\n\nAnd I work in a market as a checkout girl\n\nI know things will get better\n\nYou'll find work and I'll get promoted\n\nWe'll move out of the shelter\n\nBuy a bigger house and live in the suburbs\n\n\n\nYou got a fast car\n\nIs it fast enough so we can fly away?\n\nYou gotta make a decision\n\nLeave tonight or live and die this way\n\n\n\nSo remember when we were driving, driving in your car\n\nSpeed so fast I felt like I was drunk\n\nCity lights lay out before us\n\nAnd your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder\n\nAnd I had, had a feeling that I belonged\n\nI had, had a feeling that I could be someone\n\nHad a feeling that I could be someone (be someone)\n\nHad a feeling that I could be someone"
