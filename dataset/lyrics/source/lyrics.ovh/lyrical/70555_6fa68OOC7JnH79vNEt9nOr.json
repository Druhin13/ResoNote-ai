  "lyrics": "I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes\r\nThey've seen things that you never quite say but I hear\r\nCome out of hiding I'm right here beside you\r\nAnd I'll stay there as long as you let me\r\nBecause you matter to me\n\nSimple and plain and not much to ask from somebody\n\nYou matter to me\n\nI promise you do, you\n\nYou matter too\n\nI promise you do you'll see\n\nYou matter to me\n\n\n\nIt's addictive the minute you let yourself think\n\nThe things that I say just might matter to someone\n\nAll of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away\n\nAnd for the first time I think I'd consider the stay\n\n\n\nBecause you matter to me\n\nSimple and plain and not much to ask from somebody\n\nYou matter to me\n\nI promise you do, you\n\nYou matter too\n\nI promise you do you'll see\n\nYou matter to me\n\n\n\nAnd you matter to me\n\nSimple and plain and not much to ask from somebody\n\nYou matter to me\n\n\n\nI promise you do, you\n\n\n\nCome out of hiding I'm right here beside you\n\n\n\nYou matter too\n\n\n\nAs long as you have me\n\n\n\nI promise you do\n\n\n\nCome out of hiding I'm right here beside you\n\n\n\nYou matter too\n\nI promise you do, you\n\n\n\nI do\n\n\n\nYou matter too\n\n\n\nPromise you do\n\nYou matter to me\n\n\n\nI promise you do\n\n\n\nYou'll see\n\nYou matter to me"
