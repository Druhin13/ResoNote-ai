  "lyrics": "Still gotta walk into a crowded room\r\nWith a radio on\r\nCrack a smile and crack beer like it don't bother you\r\nLike it ain't you're song that's on\r\nStill gotta cross the bridge to get to work\r\nThe one by her place\n\nMake it through the 9 to 5 like it don't hurt\n\nIt goes that way\n\n\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\nIt don't make the evening news\n\nIt don't keep the sun from rising\n\nThe clock from winding\n\nYour heart from beating\n\nEven when you want it to\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\n\n\nStill gotta button up your collared shirt\n\nThe one she used to button down\n\nSleep on the mattress where her body left a curve\n\nOr maybe just the couch\n\nStill gotta keep her number in your phone\n\nIn case she calls back one night when she's drunk and all alone\n\nYeah, your praying for that\n\n\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\nIt don't make the evening news\n\nIt don't keep the sun from rising\n\nThe clock from winding\n\nYour heart from beating\n\nEven when you want it to\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\n\n\nThe hardest part about it is there ain't a switch that you can flip\n\nCause you can't stop loving them\n\n\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\n\n\nIt don't keep the sun from rising\n\nThe clock from winding\n\nYour heart from beating\n\nEven when you want it to\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\n\n\nWhen someone stops loving you\n\nWhen someone stops loving you"
