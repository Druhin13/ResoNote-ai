  "lyrics": "Same old story is back again \nShe's not a lover, she's just a friend \nI'm sick and tired for you to blame on me \nNow you think it's funny \nNow you wanna spend your money on girls \nBut you forgot when you were down \n\nThat I was around \n\n\n\nCall my lover, hang up, call again \n\nWhat in the world is happening \n\nListen in, but don't yell at me \n\nIsn't it ironic all you wanna do is smoke chronic \n\nBoy, you forgot when you were down \n\nWho was around \n\n\n\n1 - I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore \n\nWaiting for love to walk through the door \n\nI wish I didn't miss you anymore \n\n\n\nMemories don't live like people do \n\nI'm sick for ever believing you \n\nWish you'd bring back the man I knew \n\nWas good to me, oh Lord \n\nEverytime you say you're coming \n\nBoy, you disappoint me, honey \n\nHow well you forgot when you were down \n\nAnd I was around \n\n\n\nRepeat 1 \n\nRepeat 1 \n\n\n\nOne of these days, it's gonna happen to you \n\nMissing a love like I'm missing you, babe yeah yeah \n\nOne of these days, when your dreams come true \n\nThat's the one that's gonna do it to you \n\nOh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah \n\n\n\nRepeat 1 until fade"
