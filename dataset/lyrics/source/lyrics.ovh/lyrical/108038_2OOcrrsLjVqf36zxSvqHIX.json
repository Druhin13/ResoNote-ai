  "lyrics": "Light the match\r\nSet my body ablaze\r\nThere's no more good to find when you find yourself in a cloudy haze\r\nPressure pushes its way inside\r\nNo room to move nowhere to hide\r\nDivide the strength within myself\n\nThe way of life has pushed me to a living hell\n\nEndless misery, lack of sympathy\n\nI don't trust the voice inside of me\n\n\n\nI always put myself out there but it always ends the same\n\nIf words are words then I'm the only one to blame\n\nBackbreaker\n\nSever all the ties sever all the lies\n\nBackbreaker\n\nReach inside and see if I'm living\n\n\n\nLight the match\n\nSet my body ablaze\n\nThere's no more good to find when you find yourself in a cloudy haze\n\nEvery good intention turns to dust\n\nWhere do your loyalties lie when there's no one to trust\n\n\n\nBackbreaker\n\nSever all the ties sever all the lies\n\nBackbreaker\n\nReach inside and see if I'm living\n\nBackbreaker\n\nSever all the ties sever all the lies\n\nBackbreaker\n\nEvery fear consuming\n\nOh\n\n\n\nThe world is watching\n\nTheir eyes are piercing me now\n\nI feel the pressure\n\nThis will be my end"
