  "title": "Waiting for Christmas",
  "lyrics": "All the trees alight, all the holly streaming\r\nThe town has come to life, waiting for Christmas\r\nI still feel low, searching for some meaning\r\nUntil you come home, I'm waiting for Christmas with you\r\nChristmas without you, a long, dark shade of blue\n\nI feel like I've been waiting here forever\n\nAll the gifts arrive, all the children singing\n\nGathered 'round the fire, waiting for Christmas\n\nI could sing along, but I can't find the meaning\n\nThe melody feels wrong, I'm waiting for Christmas with you\n\n\n\nOh, when I see your face on this Christmas day\n\nI'll know the light of love brought us together\n\nBut until that hour, my eyes will be wide open\n\nI'm like a little child, waiting for Christmas\n\nWhen that morning comes, we can count our blessings\n\nIt was worth it all along, waiting for Christmas with you"
