  "lyrics": "My mother said I'm too romantic\r\nShe said, \"You're dancing in the movies\"\r\nI almost started to believe her\r\nThen I saw you and I knew\r\nMaybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older\r\nMaybe it's all that I've been through\n\nI'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder\n\nAnd how I see myself with you\n\n\n\nI don't say a word\n\nBut still you take my breath and steal the things I know\n\nThere you go, saving me from out of the cold\n\n\n\nFire on fire, would normally kill us\n\nBut this much desire together we're winners\n\nThey say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners\n\nBut don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms\n\n'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me\n\nAnd look in my eyes\n\nYou are perfection, my only direction\n\nIt's fire on fire, mmm\n\nIt's fire on fire\n\n\n\nWhen we fight we fight like lions\n\nBut then we love and feel the truth\n\nWe lose our minds in a city of roses\n\nWe won't abide by any rules \n\n\n\nI don't say a word\n\nBut still you take my breath and steal the things I know\n\nThere you go, saving me from out of the cold\n\n\n\nFire on fire, would normally kill us\n\nBut this much desire together we're winners\n\nThey say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners\n\nBut don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms\n\n'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you loved me\n\nAnd look in my eyes\n\nYou are perfection, my only direction\n\nIt's fire on fire, oh mmm\n\nIt's fire on fire\n\n\n\nFire on fire, would normally kill us\n\nBut this much desire together we're winners\n\nThey say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners\n\nBut don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms\n\n\n\nFire on fire, would normally kill us\n\nBut this much desire together we're winners\n\nThey say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners\n\nBut don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms\n\n'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you loved me\n\nAnd look in my eyes\n\nYou are perfection, my only direction\n\nIt's fire on fire\n\n\n\nYou are perfection, my only direction\n\nIt's fire on fire"
