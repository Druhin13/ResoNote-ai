  "lyrics": "Put my hair up, did my make up\r\nFifteen minutes in the mirror 'cause you said\r\nThat tonight was the night you were gonna be back in town\r\nLittle nervous, it's been a while since\r\nThe day you left and we didn't but we almost did\r\nAnd it's all that I can think about\n\n\n\nYou said the band goes on tonight\n\nYou had me high on butterflies\n\nThen I saw the girl standing by your side\n\nHad to smile so I wouldn't cry\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what hurts the worst\n\nMe alone or you with her\n\nOr all the time I wasted on the things we never were\n\nOr the way her hand was in your hand\n\nLike I wanted mine to be\n\nOr standing in the brand new dress I bought\n\n'Cause I thought it was gonna be me\n\n\n\nI try to sneak out, felt like such a fool\n\nYou came running, said \"it's so good to see you\n\nMeet my girl, yeah I think you're gonna get along\"\n\nI had to sit there and be polite\n\nWanted to hate her but she's so damn nice\n\nShe made you happy, I could see in your eyes\n\nHad to smile, so I wouldn't cry\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what hurts the worst\n\nMe alone or you with her\n\nOr all the time I wasted on the things we never were\n\nOr the way her hand was in your hand\n\nLike I wanted mine to be\n\nOr standing in the brand new dress I bought\n\n'Cause I thought it was gonna be me\n\n\n\nShoulda told you, shoulda told you\n\nOnly got myself to blame\n\nShoulda kissed you, shoulda kissed you\n\nNow it's too late\n\nGuess it's too late\n\nI really thought it was gonna be me, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what hurts the worst\n\nMe alone or you with her\n\nOr all the time I wasted on the things we never were\n\nOr the way her hand was in your hand\n\nLike I wanted mine to be\n\nOr standing in the brand new dress I bought\n\n'Cause I thought it was gonna be me\n\n\n\nI really thought it was gonna be me\n\nI really thought it was gonna be me\n\nI really thought it was gonna be me\n\nI really thought it was gonna be me"
