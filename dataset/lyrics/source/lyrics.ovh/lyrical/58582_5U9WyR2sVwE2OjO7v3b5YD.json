  "lyrics": "If you want to ride a rainbow, come with me,\r\nI will take you to the magic purple sea.\r\nMaybe we will find a thousand sugar fish;\r\nWhen you eat them they will grant your every wish.\r\nAnd if you want your friends to come,\r\nThen bring them all along...\n\n\n\nIf you want to catch a star then walk my way,\n\nI will take you where the night is always day.\n\nYou can follow me if you really try;\n\nMaybe we will find a rainbow to teach it to fly.\n\nAnd if you want your friends to come,\n\nThen bring them all along...\n\n\n\nI will take you through the magic dancing wood,\n\nAnd I will take you where the goblins are all good.\n\nI will take you where the elfs and pixies do sing,\n\nAnd I will take you 'round the magic fairy ring.\n\nAnd if you want your friends to come,\n\nThen bring them all along...\n\n\n\nBow your head and let your eyelids close on down.\n\nWhere we're going you won't need to bring your frown:\n\nYou will find that all the things that I have said\n\nWill come true when you are lying in your bed.\n\nAnd if you want your friends to come,\n\nThen bring them all along..."
