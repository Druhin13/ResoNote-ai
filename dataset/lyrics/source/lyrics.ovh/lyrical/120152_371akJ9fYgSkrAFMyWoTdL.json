  "lyrics": "It's looking like a limb torn off\r\nOr altogether just taken apart\r\nWe're reeling through an endless fall\r\nWe are the ever-living ghost of what once was\r\nBut no one is ever gonna love you more than I do\n\nNo one's gonna love you more than I do\n\n\n\nAnd anything to make you smile\n\nIt is my better side of you to admire\n\nBut they should never take so long\n\nJust to be over then back to another one\n\n\n\nBut no one is ever gonna love you more than I do\n\nNo one's gonna love you more than I do\n\n\n\nBut someone,\n\nThey could have warned you\n\nWhen things start splitting at the seams and now\n\nThe whole thing's tumbling down\n\nThings start splitting at the seams and now\n\nIf things start splitting at the seams and now,\n\nIt's tumbling down\n\nHard.\n\n\n\nAnything to make you smile\n\nYou are the ever-living ghost of what once was\n\nI never want to hear you say\n\nThat you'd be better off\n\nOr you liked it that way\n\n\n\nBut no one is ever gonna love you more than I do\n\nNo one's gonna love you more than I do\n\n\n\nBut someone\n\nThey should have warned you\n\nWhen things start splitting at the seams and now\n\nThe whole thing's tumbling down\n\nThings start splitting at the seams and now\n\nIf things start splitting at the seams and now,\n\nIt's tumbling down\n\nHard"
