  "lyrics": "So this is the end of the story\r\nEverything we had, everything we did\r\nIs buried in dust\r\nAnd this dust is all that's left of us\r\nBut only a few ever worried\n\nThough the signs were clear, we had no idea\n\nYou just get used to living in fear or give up\n\nWhen you can't even picture the future, the future\n\n\n\nSome people offered up answers\n\nWe made out like we heard, they were only words\n\nAnd didn't add up to a change in the way we were living\n\nAnd the saddest thing was, all of it could have been avoided\n\n\n\nBut it was like to stop consuming's to\n\nStop being human and why'd I make the change if you won't\n\nWe're one and the same, just staying afloat for the moment\n\nFor a moment\n\n\n\nYour heart's a mess\n\nYou won't admit to it, it makes no sense\n\nYour heart's a mess\n\nYou won't admit to it, it makes no sense\n\n\n\nBut I'm desperate to connect\n\nYou can't live like this\n\nAnd you can't live like this"
