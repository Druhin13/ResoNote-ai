  "lyrics": "Different people have their different ways of living\r\nI chose mine and it was unforgiving\r\nSomeone gave me guidance there was something in it\r\nI put it into practice and I tried to live it\r\nI'm self dividing and I have no limit\r\nI can't fix it, it's not right\n\nNothing feels good, it's not right\n\n\n\nWatching my world\n\nMake funny faces at its own reflection\n\nNothing feels good it's not right\n\nSo I'll follow my girl\n\n'Til I find myself a sense of direction\n\nNothing feels good, it's not right\n\n\n\nI found a subsidence but I overlooked it\n\nSomeone gave me guidance and for once I took it\n\nI put it in perspective and I see so clearly\n\nI'm part of a collective, oh I nearly reached it\n\nIn the distance, caught the light\n\nI can fix it, make it bright\n\n\n\nWatching my world\n\nMake funny faces at its own reflection\n\nNothing feels good it's not right\n\nSo I'll follow my girl\n\n'Til I find myself a sense of direction\n\nNothing feels good it's not right\n\nWatching my world\n\nMake funny faces at its own reflection\n\nSo I'll follow my girl\n\n'Til I found myself a sense of direction\n\n\n\nNothing feels good, I can't fix it, it’s not right\n\nNothing feels good, I can't fix it, it’s not right\n\nRight\n\n\n\nWatching my world\n\nMake funny faces at its own reflection\n\nNothing feels good it's not right\n\nSo I'll follow my girl\n\n'Til I find myself a sense of direction\n\nNothing feels good it's not right"
