  "lyrics": "I know it's not very cool\r\nStanding here serenading like a fool\r\nWell I don't care\r\nI'll gladly be a fool for you\r\nI know the idea isn't new\n\nFall in love with a girl on first view\n\nWell I don't care\n\nI think I'll fall in love with you\n\n\n\nI'll put on my Sunday best\n\nYou pick out your favorite dress\n\n\n\nAnd I'll take you somewhere new\n\nAnd I'll be old fashioned for you\n\n\n\nIt's not a dumb thing when it's cold to\n\nGive your jacket up to a girl, or so I'm told\n\nBut I don't care\n\nCause I don't mind the midnight air\n\n\n\nI'll walk you home to your front door\n\nI'll say farewell till the morning calls\n\nI'll be smiling a bigger smile than before\n\n\n\nI'll put on my Sunday best\n\nYou pick out your favorite dress\n\nI'll take you somewhere new\n\nAnd I'll be old fashioned for you\n\n\n\nI'll put on my Sunday best\n\nYou pick your favorite dress\n\nAnd I'll take you somewhere new\n\nAnd I'll be old fashioned for you\n\n\n\nOld fashioned for you"
