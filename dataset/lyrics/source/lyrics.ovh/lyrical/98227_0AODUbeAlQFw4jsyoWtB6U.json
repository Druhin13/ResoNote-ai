  "lyrics": "You should really call your brother\r\nSomeone put up a picture where he can't stand\r\nWas holding onto the table\r\nProbably throwing darts or playing cards\r\nSomething that he lost made him so mad\r\nAlways said it didn’t matter\n\nWith a pile of filthy coins clenched in his hands\n\nAsking strangers to forgive him\n\nBut he never told him what it is\n\nHe did to them that made him feel so bad\n\n\n\nSay what you mean and say it now\n\nDon't state your name, that doesn't count\n\n\n\nWho are you?\n\nWho are you-\n\n\n\nLooking for?\n\n\n\nThought that he was doing better\n\nA notice, final eviction, he just laughed\n\nAlways had a sense of humor\n\nWe still joked until the bitter end\n\nWhile all those steps he made can’t walk them back\n\n\n\nIn and out of indecision\n\nIn and out of any options he once had\n\nFarewell, so long\n\n'Til the trouble that you made and hate is gone\n\n\n\nSay what you mean and say it now\n\nDon't throw a fit, quit acting out\n\n\n\nWho are you?\n\nWho are you-\n\n\n\nWaiting for?\n\n\n\nJust go out into the falling snow\n\nJust go toward the light in the skylight\n\nJust go past the trucks on the service road\n\nJust go until you feel different"
