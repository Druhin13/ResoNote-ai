(On my feet)\nHow do you find my weakness\nJust when I think I'm free this?\nAs soon as I'm forgetting all about you\nYou end up at my door\n\n\nHow do you know, how do you\nHow do you, how do you know, how do you\nHow do you, how do you know, how do you\nHow do you, how do you know\n\nIf you really love me then let me go now\nFind somebody new and take 'em home now\nI look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over\nSo can we stop from starting something that we know that we can’t handle?\nFind somebody new, a different angle\nI look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over\nAnd we need to start all over again\nAnd again and again and again and again\n\n\nWhy do you crash my party?\n(And again and again and again and again)\nWhy do you always call me?\n(And again and again and again and again)\nWhy do you crash my party?\n(And again and again and again and again)\nYou need to let me go\nIf you really love me then let me go now\nI look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over\n\nIf you really love me then let me go now\nFind somebody new and take ’em home now\nI look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over\nSo can we stop from starting something that we know that we can't handle?\nFind somebody new, a different angle\n\nI look at you, I miss you and I stop from starting over\nAnd we need to start all over again\nAnd again and again and again and again"
