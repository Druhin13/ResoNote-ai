  "lyrics": "When the day turns to night\r\nAnd you run out of candles to burn\r\nAnd you can't find a light\r\nYou're not alone, you're not alone\r\nWhen the walls are too high\n\nThat I've built up inside\n\nAnd the wolves are outside my door\n\nYou take me home, you take me home\n\n\n\nSee the bluebirds flying high\n\nSo I'm wondering down below\n\nCould I, could I\n\n\n\nOut of the darkness, we came running\n\nOut of the darkness, we came running\n\nLeaving all our ghosts and our hurt behind\n\nLeaving that bag of stones behind\n\nIn the darkness, we keep running\n\n\n\nThere's a need to believe\n\nSo we dwell on our dreams\n\nAnd somehow we forget to live\n\nBut you wake me up, you wake me up\n\n\n\nSee the clouds rolling in and we know what\n\nThey'll bring and the fears\n\nCrawling down your spine\n\nCalling your name, it's calling your name\n\n\n\nSee the bluebirds flying high\n\nSo I'm wondering down below\n\nCould I, could I\n\n\n\nOut of the darkness, we came running\n\nOut of the darkness, we came running\n\nLeaving all our ghosts and our hurt behind\n\nLeaving that bag of stones behind\n\nIn the darkness, we keep running\n\n\n\nLeaving it all, leaving it all behind\n\nOut of the darkness, running\n\nOut of the darkness\n\n\n\nOut of the darkness, we came running\n\nOut of the darkness, we came running\n\nLeaving all the ghosts and our hurt behind\n\nLeaving that bag of stones behind\n\nIn the darkness we keep running\n\n\n\nOut of the darkness"
