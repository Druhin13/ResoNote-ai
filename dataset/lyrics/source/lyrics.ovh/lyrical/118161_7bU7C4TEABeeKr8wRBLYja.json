  "lyrics": "When I am a wasteland\r\nYou are the water\r\nWhen I am the winter\r\nYou are the fire that burns\r\nWhen I am a long night\n\nYou are the sunrise\n\nWhen I am a desert\n\nYou are the river that turns\n\nTo find me\n\n\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\n\n\nYour voice like a whisper\n\nBreaking the silence\n\nYou say there's a treasure\n\nYou'll look 'til You find it\n\nYou search to find me\n\n\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\nI cannot earn what You so freely give\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\n\n\nHallelujah\n\nHallelujah\n\nHallelujah\n\nHallelujah\n\n\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?\n\nI cannot earn what You so freely give\n\nWhat have I done to deserve love like this?"
