  "lyrics": "Waking up too early in the city feeling disconnected\r\nThe underground and my understanding have delays on the line\r\nThe weather and the way we worked out weren't quite as expected\r\nI've been melting in the summer heat going out of my mind\r\nSo far from okay, tongue-tied and afraid\n\nThe big things stay the same and you just say\n\n\n\nLittle changes\n\nLittle changes\n\n\n\nGiving up too easy when we could've tried a little bit harder\n\nStanding to the side as the neighborhood went to the dogs\n\nWe spend our energy getting angry instead of being kinder\n\nSinging hymns of praise in a city given up on by the gods\n\n\n\nSo far from okay, tongue-tied and afraid\n\nThe big things stay the same until we make\n\n\n\nLittle changes\n\nLittle changes\n\nLittle changes\n\n\n\n'Cause I've been messing things up\n\nAnd I've been letting you down\n\nI've been getting it wrong for far too long\n\nI've been lost more than found\n\nAnd I don't know where to stop\n\nBut something's gotta break\n\nDon't pull out the part, keep it close to your heart\n\nI'll do whatever it takes\n\n\n\nSo far from okay, tongue-tied and afraid\n\nThe big things stay the same, let us make\n\n\n\nLittle changes\n\nLittle changes\n\nCome on let's make some little changes\n\nIt's time to make some little changes\n\n\n\nLet's not just pray\n\nLet's make a change\n\nLet's not just pray\n\nLet's make a change\n\nCome on let's make some little changes\n\nIt's time to make some little changes"
