  "lyrics": "The field was bright with clover\r\nI saw the finish sign\r\nI started as a rover\r\nAnd then victory was mine\r\nI thought the race was over\r\nBut they just keep moving the line\n\n\n\nThey cheered at my persistence\n\nBut prayed for my decline\n\nThe path of least resistance\n\nLed to Hollywood and Vine\n\nI tried to go the distance\n\nBut they just keep moving the line\n\n\n\nI jumped all of the hurdles\n\nTo break out of the pack\n\nI started on the outside\n\nAnd then hit the inside track\n\nI left the other fillies\n\nBack at the starting gate\n\nWas ready, on my mark, I got to set\n\nTo hurry up and wait\n\n\n\nSo talent and ambition\n\nWon me a chance to shine\n\nI aced the big audition\n\nBut it's rainin' on Cloud Nine\n\nCan't beat the competition\n\n'Cause they just keep moving the line\n\n\n\nI handled every corner\n\nEach bump along the track\n\nAnd when I saw the ribbon, well\n\nThere was no turning back\n\n\n\nI won the photo finish\n\nI posed for all the men\n\nBut before I got my trophy\n\nWell, the race began again\n\nSo I made friends with rejection\n\nI've straightened up my spine!\n\nI'll change each imperfection\n\nTill it's time to drink the wine!\n\nI'd toast to resurrection\n\nBut they just keep moving the line!\n\nPlease give me some direction\n\n'Cause they just keep moving the line!"
