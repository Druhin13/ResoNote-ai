  "lyrics": "A long time ago I never knew myself. Then the memory \nOf shame birthed its gift. \nNo more. The small one, the weak one, the frightened one. \nRunning from beatings, deflating. I'm becoming more \nThan a man. More than you ever were. Driven and burning \nTo rise beyond Jesus. \n\n\n\nI'm born again with snakes eyes \n\nBecoming Godsize \n\n\n\nI found my life was slipping through my hands. Perhaps \n\nThrough death my life won't be so bad. \n\nI can see you, can fuck you, inside of you. Staring through \n\nYour eyes. Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me, \n\nTo realize my saving grasp. I of suicide. I the unlord. \n\n\n\nI'm born again with snakes eyes \n\nBecoming Godsize"
