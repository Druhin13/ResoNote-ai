  "lyrics": "Though hard times seem to be pressed against us,\r\nI see a light ahead now,\r\nAnd the time has come for each of us to go,\r\nAnd learn,\r\nAnd become what we have been dreaming of.\r\nJust get me out.\n\n\n\nToday is yesterday's tomorrow,\n\nAnd we might not be here tomorrow.\n\nWe have to make the best of every second we have.\n\nThis could be the last time I breathe in.\n\n\n\nThat I breathe in.\n\nThat I breathe in.\n\nThat I breathe in.\n\n\n\nBecause there are things upon this earth\n\nwe as human beings are not meant to endure,\n\nlike being subject to an overall judgmental society.\n\nIt makes me sick to know that my life will be \n\nrepresented by the world we are in now.\n\n\n\nGet me out. Just get me out of this world.\n\nThis is something that I fear time cannot heal for me.\n\nEveryday it's getting harder to find the energy.\n\nGet me out. Just get me out of this world.\n\nThis is something that I fear time cannot heal for me.\n\nEveryday it's getting harder to find the energy.\n\n\n\nToday is yesterday's tomorrow,\n\nAnd we might not be here tomorrow.\n\nWe have to make the best of every second we have.\n\nThis could be the last time I(we) breathe in.\n\n\n\nIt makes us sick to know that our lives will be \n\nrepresented by this world that we are existing in now.\n\n(Get me out, get me out, get me out.)\n\nIt makes us sick to know that our lives will be \n\nrepresented by this world that we are existing in now.\n\n(Get me out, get me out, get me out.)"
