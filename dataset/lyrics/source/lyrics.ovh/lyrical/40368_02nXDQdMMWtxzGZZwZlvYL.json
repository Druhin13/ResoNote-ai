  "lyrics": "Who's gonna remember what the sun is?\r\nWho's gonna keep on counting his another disease?\r\nWho's the one? Who's the man? Who's got the power\r\nTo prolong for a second his final hour?\r\nWho is gonna be the one? [x12]\n\n\n\nWho will recognize his mother's face\n\nWithout the protective mask that she wears?\n\nIs there any one who'll find a reply to the question\n\n\"What does the water taste like?\"\n\nWho's gonna be the one who cares?\n\nWho's the daredevil to protest?\n\nCome on, you motherfucker, step up of the crowd!\n\nRaise your fist in the air and shout out loud!\n\n\n\nI am gonna be the one! [x6]\n\n\n\nShout out loud!\n\n\n\nDon't step aside! Fight back with full force!\n\nPick up the weapon of your own choice\n\nDon't step aside! Fight back with full force!\n\nPick up the weapon of your own choice\n\n\n\nDon't you just step aside!\n\n\n\nDon't step aside!\n\nFight back full force!\n\nDon't step aside!\n\nDon't you just step aside!\n\n[x4]\n\n\n\nDon't deny the past you lived\n\nDon't neglect the future you have\n\nDon't deny the past you lived\n\nDon't neglect the future you have\n\nDon't deny the past you lived\n\nDon't neglect the future you have\n\nDon't deny the past you lived\n\nOh and the future you have"
