  "lyrics": "This is my happy ever suicide\r\nMy hands tied behind my breast\r\nMy silhouette did pirouettes\r\nThe curtains are closing\r\nMy baby was my ooh-lah lah, neverlasting\r\nMy baby was my cry me rivers and shadow casket\n\nWho could be my lovely, my lovely?\n\nWho could be my only one, my only?\n\nI'm almost just as empty as you think I am, a penny for your thoughts\n\nA wooden hair of happiness, a pretty Ricky Ross\n\nA may-black music, I woke up in my sympathy, became black Judas\n\nAll my everythings for sale\n\nAll my second hand discoveries, Dungarees faded pale\n\nAll my halfway hallelujahs are tippy-toed in the mail\n\nAll the fluctuations on scales\n\nAnd the missing therapy sessions of bullies treating me well\n\nWell, we don't drink that\n\nIf it ain't the top shelf, nigga you can keep that\n\nShare my life on Telefone, I'm 25 at 306, and 809 became my home\n\nGave you a taste of my redemption and now I want my drink back\n\nSomebody hold me like I'm almost enough\n\nSomebody told me pray for heaven, saw how tiny it was\n\nLittle love from me, we can build this home alone\n\nAlone\n\nForever with you, forever with you\n\nI'm a home away from home and promise you'll keep this secret\n\nAnd promise you won't forgive me to tell you that smells like peaches\n\nHe who leeches on love is a lame, chains and left her for London\n\nWireless festival reparable, so good when he wasn't"
