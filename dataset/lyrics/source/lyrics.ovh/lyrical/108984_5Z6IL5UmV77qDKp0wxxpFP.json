  "lyrics": "When it's late and I miss you\r\nAnd I'm sleepless and stand still\r\nAnd I wonder if you are [?] love\r\nOr if you are still thinking about me\r\nCause it's late and I miss when\r\nYou were here in my bed still\n\nWith your mouth on my neck\n\nAnd your hands on your waist\n\nAnd my hands on your body\n\n\n\nSo tell me it's not, tell it's not, oh, tell me it's over\n\nSo tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's not and you're coming over\n\nTell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over\n\nAnd you're coming over\n\n\n\n[?] thinking too much and I miss you, I miss you, I miss you\n\nI miss you in the morning\n\nI tried to replace it, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you\n\nI miss being important\n\nMy body is wasted on these conversations I hated\n\nYou make me wanna forget\n\nWhat happened to honest\n\nCause honestly all that I want is to feel important\n\n\n\nSo tell me it's not, tell it's not, oh, tell me it's over\n\nSo tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's not and you're coming over\n\nTell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over\n\nAnd you're coming over\n\n\n\nToo much, she on too much\n\nObsessed with being obsessed, not being in love\n\nBeing backlit by fireworks and drugs\n\nBeing passionate about everything but us\n\nAnd now I'm hands-up in the hallway\n\nElevator fights spilling into streets all day\n\nSecond half with the bad habit, you, yeah\n\nSecond chance but I'm still bad at truth, yeah\n\nTit-for-tat but we always end up back here\n\nHungover in a deli, going halves for the cashier\n\nCan't tell if I'm over you, man, I might call\n\nI miss you in the morning and even more when night falls\n\n\n\nSo tell me it's not, tell it's not, oh, tell me it's over\n\nSo tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's not and you're coming over\n\nTell me it's not, tell me it's not, oh, tell me it's over\n\nAnd you're coming over\n\n\n\nHey, um, I called twice\n\nI don't know if your phone's dead or it's going to voicemail\n\nBut I'm, uh, I'm standing on the end of the block right now\n\nI just wanna talk for a second"
