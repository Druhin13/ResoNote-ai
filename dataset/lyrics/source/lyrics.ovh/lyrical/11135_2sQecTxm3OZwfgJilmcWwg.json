  "lyrics": "What's left\r\nWhen the ground cracks\r\nAnd the sky is black\r\nIt's a lonely life\r\nEverybody lives, everybody lies\n\nWhen the Earth shifts\n\nSomeone leave you on the other side\n\nYou will reach through me, you think\n\nThat you need me but you don't need me\n\n\n\nOh it's a lonely life\n\nI'm an old fisherman\n\nThrough all my life\n\nI'll pull you in\n\nDrive my boat, drive my hook\n\nPull it out and throw you back into the deep end\n\nOh it's a lonely life\n\n\n\nWhat's left\n\nWhen the ground cracks\n\nAnd the sky is black\n\nWhere will you land\n\n\n\nIn a game of pieces, baby\n\nWhat's your strategy\n\nTry your best, connect to me\n\nBut the ocean is wider than you'd think\n\nIn a continental jigsaw\n\n\n\nIt's a lonely life\n\nEverybody lives, everybody lies\n\nWhen the Earth shifts and you leave me on the other side\n\nIt's a lonely life\n\nOh it's a lonely life"
