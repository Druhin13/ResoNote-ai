Where I walk now\n\nWhen I talk now. When I talk now\n\nOh where I walk now. Where I walk now\n\nWhen I talk. When I talk\n\n\n\nFlashlights go out\n\nStars will light the way\n\nLike mexican dogs\n\nNobody gave us names\n\n\n\nTires burn in the dark\n\nMary\\'s beads and the burning heart\n\nFalling apart\n\n\n\nHigh tide kicking sand\n\nHigh tide we\\'re all raised to win\n\nTo taste the salt\n\n\n\nCoca-cola\n\nCost a quarter on my block\n\nOn my block\n\nCoca-cola \n\nCost a quarter on my block\n\nOn my block\n\n\n\nFlashlights go out\n\nThe stars will light the way\n\nLike mexican dogs\n\nNobody gave us names\n\nFlash lights go out\n\nThe stars will light the way\n\nLike mexican dogs\n\nNobody gave us names\n\n\n\nWe will chase the bright lights till we\\'re done\n\nWe\\'ll chase the bright lights\n\nWe will chase the bright lights till we\\'re done\n\nWe\\'ll chase the bright lights\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I taste the salt\n\nWhen I taste the salt\n\nAnd I taste the salt\n\nAnd I taste the salt\n\nMexican dogs\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Matt for these lyrics)"
