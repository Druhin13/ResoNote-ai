  "lyrics": "Looking back, I ponder all the possibilities\r\nThat I had sat right in front of me\r\nEvery one an optional decision\r\nGiving birth to a dedicated universe\r\nOnly if I'd known long ago\n\nThat a choice will grow\n\nInto another road\n\n\n\nBut I heard that every single version of events\n\nWill occur whatever we expect\n\nAnd as such, I really needn't worry very much\n\n'Cause I feel all worlds at once\n\n\n\nOnly if I'd known long ago\n\nSpace is ours to roam\n\nIf you can find your own\n\n\n\nReality proves me\n\nIt goes pretty smoothly\n\nBut I haven't found the meaning\n\nQuite yet\n\n\n\nOnly if I'd known long ago\n\nThat a choice will grow\n\nInto another road\n\nOnly if I'd known long ago\n\nSpace is ours to roam\n\nIf you can find your own\n\n\n\nWho tore the sky? Who copied me?\n\nWater going back on itself, up to the sea\n\nIs that, a whole world talking from just behind a ceiling?\n\nWatch me get my two timelines\n\nNot going through the door all alone\n\nI leave something on the side\n\nSo you know I said hello"
