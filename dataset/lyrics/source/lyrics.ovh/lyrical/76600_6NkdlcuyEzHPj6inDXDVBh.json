  "lyrics": "I'd race to meet you at the top of the stairs\r\nYou'd come from working, you were always there for me\r\nYou'd scare the nightmares, singing me an old song\r\nYou'd learn in Oshkosh [?], you were always there for me\r\nBut what was it like to be you?\n\nYou said, I could never see what passing judgment\n\nOn anybody else would ever do for me\n\nBut I love that you see the things that you couldn't see\n\nYou showed me how to live\n\n\n\nMy dance recitals, they were never concise\n\nYou never missed one, you were always there for me\n\nYou told me softly that I had what it takes\n\nTo make it anywhere, you were always there for me\n\nWell, what was it like to be you?\n\n\n\nYou said, I could never see what passing judgment\n\nOn anybody else would ever do for me\n\nBut I love how you see the things that you couldn't see\n\nYou showed me how to die\n\n\n\nWhat was it like to be you?\n\nYou said, I could never see what passing judgment\n\nOn anybody else would ever do for me\n\nWell, I love how you see the things that you couldn't see\n\nYou showed me how to see\n\nAnd what to look for in a man\n\nAnd what to look for in a man\n\nAnd what to look for in a man\n\n\n\nI'd race to meet you at the top of the stairs\n\nYou'd come from working, you were always there for me"
