  "lyrics": "Can you hear the desperate cries that are calling out your name?\r\nTwisting your arms, holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve\r\nDo you feel this underlying sense of urgency or are you as blind as me?\r\nI hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight\r\nI swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere now\n\n\n\nI can't bear the thought of losing\n\nI dread the attention winning brings\n\nAnd ever since the day I came here\n\nI can stand without your strings\n\nI'm so sick of all these people\n\nBut I'm scared to be alone\n\nAnd if this life has taught me anything\n\nI forgot it long ago and so I\n\n\n\nI hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight\n\nI swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes\n\n\n\nThe heart is something you can't control\n\nWe either choose to follow or be left on our own\n\nSo we're leaving here on a less-traveled road\n\nAs desperate cries grow louder, I know we're getting close, getting close\n\n\n\nI hit the ground and I'm still running but I need a place to stay tonight\n\nI swear I'll be gone in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes"
