  "lyrics": "May my hands be the hands you hold onto\r\nWhen you let go of everything else\r\nMay my arms be the arms that you fall into\r\nWhen the night gets too heavy to hold by yourself\r\nIf you're looking for a safe place to land\n\nI will guide you home\n\nAnd if the levy of your life breaks all your plans\n\nYou'll never be alone\n\n\n\nIf you dance with me\n\nFeel my heartbeat through your body to your feet\n\nIf you dance with me\n\nHold me in the dark now, until both your eyes can see\n\nAnd if it's you and me against the world\n\nIf I'm your man, you're my girl\n\nWe'll win you'll see, if you dance with me\n\n\n\nMay my shoulder be the shoulder you rest your head on\n\nWhen you close your eyes to sleep\n\nAnd may my lips be the lips that you wake up to\n\nKiss you like the morning sun\n\nAll over your smile\n\n\n\nAnd no matter where this winding road will lead you\n\nI will keep you strong\n\nThrough the minors and the majors, I will sing you like a song\n\nI hope you sing along\n\n\n\nAnd I hope you dance with me\n\nFeel my heartbeat through your body to your feet\n\nI hope you dance with me\n\nHold me in the dark now, until both your eyes can see\n\nAnd if it's you and me against the world\n\nIf I'm your man and you're my girl\n\nWe'll win you'll see, if you dance with me\n\nAnd if my heart is yours and yours is mine\n\nTogether through the test of time\n\nWe'll win you'll see, if you dance with me\n\nWe'll win you'll see, if you dance with me"
