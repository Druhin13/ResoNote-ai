  "lyrics": "The other night I walked around\r\nAnd came to a decision\r\nThe River guided me\r\nIt ate my soul and left my body\r\nThe creatures fed on me\r\nIt's calmer now\n\nThe water's rising\n\n\n\nThe rain\n\nI've become\n\nWhat I've wanted\n\n\n\nI'm floating on\n\nDon't even know what you are missing\n\n\n\nThe tired ivory streams\n\nThrough the flood of the collected\n\nHe river asks of me\n\nTo give me mind o those deserving\n\nLetting go of raw materials\n\nThat once had made me\n\nThe river teaches me\n\nAdore the now\n\nNot passing moments\n\n\n\nI've become\n\nWhat I've wanted\n\n\n\nI'm floating on\n\nDon't even know what you are missing\n\n\n\nOh, won't you float away\n\nIgnore the things around you\n\nFloat with me\n\n\n\nI'm floating on\n\nDon't even know what you are missing"
