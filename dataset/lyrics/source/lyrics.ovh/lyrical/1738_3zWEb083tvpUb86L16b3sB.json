  "lyrics": "When it's gone too far, yeah\r\nI don't know where we go from here\r\nCan't see the north star\r\nI don't know where we go from here\r\nThings turned into a hole you cancel\r\nThings turned into a long year\n\nSome words you can't take it back, no\n\nI don't know where we go from here\n\n\n\n(Doing these stupid things)\n\n(*laughing*)\n\n(Ah, fuck, that hurts)\n\n(You're doing a really good job)\n\n\n\nSometimes I could, sometimes I could almost laugh\n\nI lay awake from a nightmare\n\nWe're in a low gear, but driving fast\n\nI don't know where we go from here\n\n\n\nIf a war is what you want\n\nI'll volunteer [?]\n\nDrop your bombs on my house\n\nI'll rebuild, I'll rebuild every ounce\n\nEvery [?]\n\nOnly shows what's underneath\n\nYou set my watch, for a world in time\n\nLook at the hands, I'll be fine\n\n\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine\n\nI'll be just fine"
