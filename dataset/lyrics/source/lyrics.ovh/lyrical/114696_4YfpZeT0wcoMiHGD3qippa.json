Tell 'em get off my dick\n\nStepped out and I look like a brick\n\nThirty bands, I put that on my wrist\n\nNew Rollie, can't hear when it tick\n\nForever gon' be on that young nigga set\n\nThey all in my business, don't know who I'm with\n\nI'm after the sack, come and watch me get rich\n\nI'm on my way up\n\nI think 'bout a mill' everyday when I wake up\n\nReal shit, I ain't made up\n\nYeah, I'm a young nigga, but I got my weight up\n\nThey ain't got a clue\n\nMight buy a new foreign 'cause there ain't shit to do\n\nYou can't do what I do\n\nI got 'em in love when they spotted the coupe\n\n\n\nFor the ones said I wouldn't be shit\n\nI been told myself that I would never quit\n\nInvested my bands, let 'em sit\n\nJust know I'm right here if you're down on your dick\n\nFor my brothers, none them niggas snitched\n\nI wish I could give him the time that he missed\n\nThat's the last time I'm totin' them sticks\n\nThey goin' all in if I tell 'em to blitz\n\nI got 'em confused\n\nWhy speak on me? I don't know you\n\nShould I take off the roof?\n\n200 my dash, no way I can cruise\n\nWent Louis my shoes\n\nThere's too much designer, no way I can lose\n\nThis shit kept me true\n\nYou fucked over me twice but I played the shit cool\n\nBaby, watch how you move\n\nYou play with my feelings, that ain't what you do\n\nCould've told me the truth\n\nI would've been better off cuttin' off you\n\nBitch, you overdue\n\nAsk me do I love her, I responded like, \"Who?\"\n\nI can buy me a school\n\nMy money got longer, this shit to the roof\n\n\n\nYou know I get out there quick\n\nWhat they say? Tell 'em get off my dick\n\nStepped out and I look like a brick\n\nThirty bands, I put that on my wrist\n\nNew Rollie, can't hear when it tick\n\nForever gon' be on that young nigga set\n\nThey all in my business, don't know who I'm with\n\nI'm after the sack, come and watch me get rich\n\nI'm on my way up\n\nI think 'bout a mill' everyday when I wake up\n\nReal shit, I ain't made up\n\nYeah, I'm a young nigga, but I got my weight up\n\nThey ain't got a clue\n\nMight buy a new foreign 'cause there ain't shit to do\n\nYou can't do what I do\n\nI got 'em in love when they spotted the coupe\n\n\n\nAnd I don't wanna wake up"
