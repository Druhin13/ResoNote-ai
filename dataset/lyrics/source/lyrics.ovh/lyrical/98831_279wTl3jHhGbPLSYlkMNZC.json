  "lyrics": "Maybe it's all down to the thought of her\r\nMaybe it's all down to the loss we learned\r\nKnew for a long time, for all it's worth\r\nI wanted to run to you\r\nWhat if I'm caught up on it's me you're calling\r\nWhat if I'm lost now, plus if demons come in\n\nWhen she kissed me I felt a new freedom or something (well)\n\nMove on\n\nI found a moment to be brave, so I let her know\n\nAnd she said, \"how could I love you back, you who dropped your dreams in the gutter,\"\n\nIn my winter, she'll be burning slow\n\nFeels like December knows me well\n\n\n\n'Cause I loved ya\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you now?\n\nI loved ya\n\nGet me back on homely ground\n\nShe said, \"oh I know that love is all about the wind\n\nHow it can hold me up and kill me in the end,\"\n\nStill I loved it\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you now?\n\n\n\nDays when we all watched 'till we lost the birds\n\nThrew a rose in, 'till it caught the turn\n\nKnew it felt right, we were bound to burn\n\nI wanted to run to you\n\nMaybe I've lost count of the rooms you're tall in\n\nMaybe I've lost count of the nighttime all ins\n\nSo the trees and her were first to know\n\nIt'll all be good, just hold me well\n\n\n\n'Cause I loved ya\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you now?\n\nI loved ya\n\nGet me back on homely ground\n\nShe said, \"oh I know that love is all about the wind\n\nHow it can hold me up and kill me in the end,\"\n\nStill I loved it\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you now?\n\n\n\nWasn't easy to go, I know\n\nYou shouldn't have no seat in the front row\n\nI know, I know\n\nWasn't easy to go, I know\n\nAnd the sun came out, day late though\n\nI know, I know\n\nWasn't easy to go, I know\n\nHe pulled up, flat tyres, ten spokes\n\nI know I know\n\nWasn't easy to go, I know\n\nHe came all that way just to say hello\n\nI know, I know\n\n\n\n'Cause I loved ya\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you now?\n\nI loved ya\n\nGet me back on homely ground\n\nShe said, \"oh I know that love is all about the wind\n\nHow it can hold me up and kill me in the end,\"\n\nStill I loved it\n\nDoes that mean nothing to you now?"
