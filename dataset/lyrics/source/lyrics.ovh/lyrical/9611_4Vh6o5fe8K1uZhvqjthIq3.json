  "lyrics": "I've been riding around Saturn's rings\r\nLearning how each one sings\r\nJumping from star to star\r\nFinding my own heart\r\nI've been learning to slow down\n\nPutting roots in that ground\n\nWaiting until that fruit is ripe\n\nGrowing up in that light\n\n\n\nSunshine through my window\n\nShe's coming home tomorrow\n\nIt's my choice to be joyful\n\nGiving up all sorrow\n\n\n\nThis is my story\n\nThis is my vision\n\nEverything right on time\n\n\n\nWell I'm hearing Jupiter's Call\n\nGot me feeling strong and tall\n\nLaughing at the play of life\n\nGiving me a brand new sight\n\n\n\nThe war between right and wrong\n\nI'm putting it all in song\n\nAnd trust that I do my best\n\nLetting my body rest\n\n\n\nSunshine through my window\n\nShe's coming home tomorrow\n\nIt's my choice to be joyful\n\nGiving up all sorrow\n\n\n\nThis is my story\n\nThis is my vision\n\nEverything right on time\n\n\n\nSunshine through my window\n\nShe's coming home tomorrow\n\nIt's my choice to be joyful\n\nGiving up all sorrow\n\n\n\nThis is my story\n\nThis is my vision\n\nEverything right on time"
