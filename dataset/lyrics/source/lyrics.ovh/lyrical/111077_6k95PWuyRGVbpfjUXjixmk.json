  "lyrics": "I see you're waiting for change that never comes\r\n(Under the ocean, your sails are open)\r\nAnticipating a pace like you're on the run\r\n(You think you're broken, won't dip your toes in)\r\nIf you only knew what you could do\n\nEverything, everything is alright, alright\n\nI will heal your black and blue\n\nEverything, everything is alright, you know\n\n\n\nI don't have another way\n\nIt's like fire and it's written on my face\n\nYou're in my heart, you're on my brain\n\nYou're like fire and you're running, always running\n\nI won't let you slip away\n\nI won't let you slip away now\n\nI won't let you slip away now\n\nI won't let you slip away now\n\n\n\nMove in slow motion, replay every memory\n\n(Just like a movie, everything to me)\n\nLove that I've chosen, ring like a symphony\n\nYou're running through her, can't help my screaming\n\n\n\nIf you only knew what you could do\n\nEverything, everything is alright, alright\n\nI will heal your black and blue\n\nEverything, everything is alright, you know\n\n\n\nI don't have another way\n\nIt's like fire and it's written on my face\n\nYou're in my heart, you're on my brain\n\nYou're like fire and you're running, always running\n\nI won't let you slip away\n\nYou're like fire and you're running, always running\n\nI won't let you slip away\n\nI won't let you slip away now\n\nI won't let you slip away now\n\nI won't let you slip away now"
