(Drive for me)\n\nWhen all I feel is low will you get high for me? (High for me)\n\nHow hard would you try for me?\n\nIf they put you on the stand\n\nWould you lie for me ?\n\nWould you put the whole world on hold for me?\n\nHow real, how real is it?\n\nWhen all I feel is low\n\nWill you get high for me? (High for me)\n\n\n\nIf you ever fucked up\n\nI would empty all my accounts,\n\nBail you out\n\nYeah\n\nIf you’re ever sinking fast\n\nI would empty both my lungs out to keep you breathing, breathing.\n\n\n\nRacing through streets locked hands and chemical inside my body\n\nI need to know when it comes crashing down\n\nWhen I can’t hold the wheel\n\nWill you drive for me? (Drive for me)\n\nWhen all I feel is low will you get high for me? (High for me)\n\nHow hard would you try for me?\n\nIf they put you on the stand\n\nWould you lie for me ?\n\nWould you put the whole world on hold for me?\n\nHow real, how real is it?\n\nWhen all I feel is low\n\nWill you get high for me? (High for me)\n\n\n\nIt’s kid Ink\n\nBaby let’s roll one up and blow one to the ceiling\n\nOoowee it’s such a wonderful feeling\n\nTo lay my hands on you like I’m healing\n\nI could get right behind your wheel and drop the top and jump over the front door\n\nYou giving me the go I’m like run forest\n\nHop inside the whip and say what’s the button for\n\nWhip so fast wind opened up her button more\n\n\n\nI love the way you ride\n\nWill you drive for me? (Drive for me)\n\nWhen all I feel is low\n\nWill you get high for me? (High for me)\n\nHow hard would you try for me?\n\nIf they put you on the stand\n\nWould you lie for me?\n\nWould you put the whole world on hold for me?\n\nHow real, how real is it?\n\nWhen all I feel is low\n\nWill you get high for me? (High for me)"
