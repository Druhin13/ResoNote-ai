  "lyrics": "Home grown alligator, see you later\r\nGotta hit the road, gotta hit the road\r\nSomething changed in the atmosphere\r\nArchitecture unfamiliar\r\nI could get used to this\n\nTime flies by in the yellow and green\n\nStick around and you'll see what I mean\n\nThere's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of\n\nIf you need me you know where I'll be\n\n\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\n\n\nThe South of the Equator, navigator\n\nGotta hit the road, gotta hit the road\n\nTipsy diving round the clock, bikini bottoms, Lager tops\n\nI could get used to this\n\n\n\nTime flies by in the yellow and green\n\nStick around and you'll see what I mean\n\nThere's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of\n\nIf you need me you know where I'll be\n\n\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\n\n\nWe got two in the front\n\nTwo in the back\n\nSailing along\n\nAnd we don't look back\n\n\n\nTime flies by in the yellow and green\n\nStick around and you'll see what I mean\n\nThere's a mountaintop that I'm dreaming of\n\nIf you need me, you know where I'll be\n\n\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone\n\nI'll be riding shotgun underneath the hot sun\n\nFeeling like I'm someone, someone, someone..."
