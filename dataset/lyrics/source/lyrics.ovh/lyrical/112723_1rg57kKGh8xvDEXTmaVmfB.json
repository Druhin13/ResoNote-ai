  "lyrics": "I'm about sick and tired of this bar crowd\r\nI’ll throw some money down if you want to step out\r\nYou’ve got me locked in, take my hand\r\nCome be my queen, sitting up in my king ranch\r\nBet you’d look good on a two lane back road\r\nBare feet on the dash, hand out the window\n\n\n\nI want to ride all night, you sitting to my right\n\nTill we get tomorrow shining in the headlights\n\nI want to show you around this little farm town\n\nFind some places that we can’t be found, girl\n\nJust wanna take my time, just you and me baby\n\nI wanna ride all night\n\n\n\nIf this keeps going good\n\nI’m gonna make a little stop down by the creek\n\nLay you down in my truck bed\n\nSteal another kiss before we drive off\n\nI don’t know what you did but I’m already gone\n\n\n\nI want to ride all night, you sitting to my right\n\nTill we get tomorrow shining in the headlights\n\nI want to show you around this little farm town\n\nFind some places that we can’t be found, girl\n\nJust wanna take my time, just you and me baby\n\nI wanna ride all night\n\n\n\nBet you’d look good on a two lane back road\n\nBare feet on the dash, hand out the window\n\n\n\nI wanna ride all night, you sitting to my right\n\nTill we get tomorrow shining in the headlights\n\nI want to show you around this little farm town\n\nFind some places that we can’t be found, girl\n\nJust wanna take my time, just you and me baby\n\nI wanna ride all night\n\nI wanna ride all night\n\nI wanna ride all night"
