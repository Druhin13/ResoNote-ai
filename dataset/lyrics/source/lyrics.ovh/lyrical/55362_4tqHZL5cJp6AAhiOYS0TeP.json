  "lyrics": "Always, always search for the light\r\nEven in the darkest night\r\nOh I follow the drums and the bass\r\nCause it makes me feel alive\r\nI Call out your name\n\nI Follow the trails\n\nI Can feel it deep inside\n\nThe heartbeats, the sounds\n\n\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\n\n\nSomeday, someday I will be free\n\nBut I wonder, do you still think of me?\n\nDo you remember when our love was true?\n\nDo you remember when it was me and you?\n\n\n\nOh I, Oh I dream of you when I close my eyes\n\nOh I, Oh I dream of you when I close my eyes\n\n\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?\n\nDid you know you left me on fire?"
