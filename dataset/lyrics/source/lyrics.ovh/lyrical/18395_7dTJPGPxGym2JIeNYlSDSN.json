  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Driving Down to L.A. par Ezra Furman\r\nDon’t tell my mom, don’t tell my dad\nI’ve been driving down to L.A. with my baby\nOn the cliffs, he drives real fast\nHe may drive his car into the ocean, maybe\n\nI don’t mind\nI’ve got big dreams in my mind\nI would give up my whole life for that feelin’\nNo, I don’t mind\nIf I lose my legs or die\nI’ve built a home inside his eyes\nAnd I ain’t leavin’\n\nDon’t tell my mom, don’t tell my brother\nI’ve been driving down the freeway with my master\n\nThere’s one law and I’ve known no other\nIt’s the law of love I’m bound to, drive me faster\n\nI don’t mind\nI’ll gladly pay that highway fine\nThis little heart is open wide and it’s getting wider\nNo, I don’t mind\nIf we cross the thin white lines\nOver a cliff down to the ground\nI am your rider"
