  "lyrics": "I hope you understand that you got to be commanding\r\nI've never made the [?] with someone by my side\r\nOh, I could have not have planned it\r\nI didn't do romantic\r\nI've never met another who got it all so right\n\nYou've got something in your bones that makes your blood hot every night\n\nYou've got a fire in your soul\n\nIt makes my heart stop every time\n\n\n\nI gotta hand it to ya 'cause I can see right through ya\n\nThere's not a storm of thunder that could get you out my sight\n\nWe got our own addictions\n\nYou say it with conviction\n\nA certain type of friction can't keep us warm at night\n\n\n\nYou've got something in your bones that makes your blood hot every night\n\nYou've got a fire in your soul\n\nIt makes my heart stop every time\n\n\n\nGive me everything, everything\n\nGive me good\n\nAnd I had no time to breathe, time to breathe over you baby\n\nGive me everything, everything\n\nGive me good\n\nAnd I had no time to bring, time to bring something to the table\n\n\n\nThere's a hurry in your heartbeat\n\nA fire in your soul\n\nAnd every time that you move, that feeling grows\n\nStarting rumours in the backseat and they'll never need to know\n\nAnd suddenly I've never been in love before\n\n\n\nYou've got something in your bones that makes your blood hot every night\n\nYou've got a fire in your soul\n\nIt makes my heart stop every time\n\n\n\nGive me everything, everything\n\nGive me good\n\nAnd I had no time to breathe, time to breathe over you baby\n\nGive me everything, everything\n\nGive me good\n\nAnd I had no time to bring, time to bring something to the table"
