  "lyrics": "Don’t I know what they all want\r\nA perfect Speci – Men, I reel them in at once\r\nEvery move I make I flaunt\r\nGet pretty like I mean it, a real debutante\r\nI know I’m surely hot\r\nWhen they put up a fuss\n\nGet anything I want\n\nI do command applause\n\nDon’t mean to turn ‘em out\n\nIt seems it’s just because\n\nIt’s something that I got\n\nThey don’t know what it was\n\nBut every time I close my eyes\n\nWhat is it I’m dreaming of\n\nA perfect life\n\nWake up I know every time, all doey-eyed\n\nAnd I think about you\n\nOh-oh-oh you\n\nEvery time I close my eyes\n\nI’m nearer to the day my love\n\nNeeds no disguise\n\nI’ll chase it ‘til the end of time\n\nThe perfect life\n\nIt can’t be without you, ooo-oo\n\nCan’t be without you-oo\n\n\n\nWish that I could be upfront\n\nLike an army general, with no nuance\n\nBut blooming out here in the sun\n\nA guarded little thing, turns perfect all at once\n\nWhat is this bug I’ve caught\n\nWhat’s it an aching of\n\nI cover up the spots\n\nI wear it like a glove\n\nCan entertain them all\n\nCreate a flawless buzz\n\nBut it ain’t perfect, not\n\nUntil I fall in love\n\nEvery time I close my eyes\n\n\n\nWhat is it I’m dreaming of\n\nA perfect life\n\nWake up I know every time, all doey-eyed\n\nAnd I think about you\n\nOh- oh-oh you\n\nEvery time I close my eyes\n\nI’m nearer to the day my love\n\nNeeds no disguise\n\nI’ll chase it ‘til the end of time\n\nThe perfect life\n\nIt can’t be without you, ooo-oo\n\nCan’t be without you-oo"
