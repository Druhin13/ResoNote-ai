  "lyrics": "When you fell\r\nFrom the sky\r\nWe all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes\r\nBaby we got soaked\r\nWhen you fell\r\nFrom the sky\n\nI felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane\n\nI thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain\n\n\n\nThere's a drought in California\n\nThe weeks turned into months my dear\n\nAnd I wait up all night for you\n\nThe minutes turn into fucking years\n\nAnd I see you through a skylight from a mile away, a mile away\n\nI replay all the highlights from a different state, a different state\n\n\n\nWhen you fell\n\nFrom the sky\n\nWe all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes\n\nBaby we got soaked\n\nWhen you fell\n\nFrom the sky\n\nI felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane\n\nI thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain\n\n\n\nI fill my cup from the tap\n\nI let my sips overlap\n\nI let the sink overflow\n\nI drink it down 'til I'm bones\n\nAnd I feel I can't be honest\n\nAbout anything I wanted\n\nCause you're taunting with memories\n\nWithout even talking and I pray\n\nFor a drought again\n\nYeah I pray for damage undid\n\nOh and Iâ€™d give anything\n\nTo just take back the love I misplaced in you\n\n\n\nWhen you fell\n\nFrom the sky\n\nWe all stopped and stood outside to wash our clothes\n\nBaby we got soaked\n\nWhen you fell\n\nFrom the sky\n\nI felt that burning in my eyes, drove me insane\n\nI thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain\n\n\n\nI thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain\n\nI thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain\n\nI thought that you were holy water but you were just acid rain"
