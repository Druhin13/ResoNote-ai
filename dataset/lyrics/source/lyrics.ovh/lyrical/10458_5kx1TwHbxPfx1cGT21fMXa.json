  "lyrics": "This just dawned on me:\r\nI haven’t spoken to another person in a week\r\nI’ve been sitting silently\r\nTelling myself I need time to think\r\nI met you at the coffeeshop\r\nWe marched on the interstate and blocked the cops\n\nThe echoes of the flash grenades\n\nRang in our ears as we moved along\n\n\n\nI called it “positivity,”\n\nAnd congratulated myself on a job well done\n\nBut after a couple of days\n\nThe fire that I thought would burn it down was gone\n\nMeet me at the Polish bar\n\nI’ll be the one looking at my phone\n\nShaking like a nervous kid\n\nAbsolutely terrified of being alone\n\n\n\nSo where can you go when the troubles inside you\n\nMake your limbs feel like they’re covered in lead?\n\nHow can you solve all the problems around you\n\nWhen you can’t even solve the ones in your head?\n\nI need you right now\n\nI need you right now\n\nBefore I feel totally dead\n\n\n\nIt came on suddenly\n\nI haven’t spoken to another person in a month\n\nWell, small talk, OBVIOUSLY\n\nBut nothing beyond barely catching up\n\nI have lots of things to say\n\nBut they’re gonna sound dumb dumb dumb\n\nI have lots of things to say\n\nBut I’m just an idiot\n\n\n\nSo where can you go when the troubles inside you\n\nMake your limbs feel like they’re covered in lead?\n\nHow can you solve all the problems around you\n\nWhen you can’t even solve the ones in your head?\n\nI need you right now\n\nI need you right now\n\nBefore I feel totally dead\n\n\n\nShriek into the toxic well\n\nWhere everybody’s screaming for themselves\n\nAnd leaves no space to process feeling lost\n\nThese overwhelming distractions\n\nLead to powerlessness\n\nAnd I feel too weak to walk it off\n\n\n\nMeet me at the Polish bar\n\nI’ll be the one looking at my phone\n\nShaking like a nervous kid\n\nTotally terrified of being alone\n\n\n\nSo where can you go when the troubles inside you\n\nMake your limbs feel like they’re covered in lead?\n\nHow can you solve all the problems around you\n\nWhen you can’t even solve the ones in your head?\n\nI need you right now\n\nI need you right now\n\nBefore I feel totally dead\n\n[ghost noises]"
