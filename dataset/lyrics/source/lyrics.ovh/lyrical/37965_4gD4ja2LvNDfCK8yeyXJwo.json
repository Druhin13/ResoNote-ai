  "lyrics": "I'm done with talking and my head is full of alcohol\r\nI'm seeing people, blurry like graffiti on the wall\r\nAnd every time I seem to find you and surrend my calls\r\nWhen it's on the line you just arrive and we escape it all\r\nHead for another sky\n\nLet's just take a plane to the other side\n\nStay locked away till we run out of time\n\nLet's run for our lives\n\nCome on let's go and let's disappear\n\n\n\nWe disappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\n\n\nIn the backseat of the taxi you don't say a thing\n\nOur conversation is the way we tangle skin on skin\n\nAnd every draft will be so amplified our love to sound\n\nBut while our sight couldn't be further from where we are now\n\n\n\nHead for another sky\n\nLet's just take a plane to the other side\n\nStay locked away till we run out of time\n\nLet's run for our lives\n\nCome on let's go and let's disappear\n\n\n\nWe disappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\n\n\nHead for the rivers\n\nWatch the water fall\n\nFeeling your shivers\n\nAs our body fall as one\n\nLost in the vision\n\nIn our own atmosphere\n\nSo tell me where you wanna go\n\nAnd let's disappear\n\n\n\nWe disappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nDisappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDisappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDisappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\n\n\nAnd let's disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nDis-disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nWe disappear\n\nLet's disappear\n\nDis-dis-disappear\n\nLet's disappear"
