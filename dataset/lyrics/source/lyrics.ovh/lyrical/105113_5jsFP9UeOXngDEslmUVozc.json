  "lyrics": "All or nothin', the way it's supposed to be\r\nSwingin' for the fence at every opportunity\r\nUp and over the mountain while everybody goes 'round\r\nAll the rest stand still, I pick 'em up and I put 'em down\r\nI still push and I still shove\n\nI'm still hard to love\n\nI ain't changed, I'm still the same wise-ass I always was\n\nThey say the day will come\n\nI'll be too tired to run\n\nYeah, you can't stop what's comin': I'll run until the wheels fall off\n\nRun until the wheels fall off\n\n\n\nCracked wide open, way out over the line\n\nOut there and grab it 'cause it's dyin' on the vine\n\nThe wealth and the glory, the worship and the fame\n\nThey love you and they hate you, boy, but they all know your name\n\n\n\nI still push and I still shove\n\nI'm still hard to love\n\nI ain't changed, I'm still the same wise-ass I always was\n\nThey say the day will come\n\nI'll be too tired to run\n\nYeah, you can't stop what's comin': I'll run until the wheels fall off\n\nRun until the wheels fall off\n\nRun until the wheels fall off\n\n\n\nI still push and I still shove\n\nI'm still hard to love\n\nI ain't changed, I'm still the same wise-ass I always was\n\nThey say the day will come\n\nI'll be too tired to run\n\nYeah, you can't stop what's comin': I'll run until the wheels fall off\n\nRun until the wheels fall off\n\nRun until the wheels fall off"
