  "lyrics": "Laid out all my payments\r\nDrinking too much coffee\r\nDidn't get my education\r\nBut no that didn't stop me\r\nI was raised by my computer\r\nAnd that television\n\nNow they say I have no future;\n\nBut I got blind ambition, yeah\n\nAnd I'm on a mission:\n\nFollow my own vision\n\nI'm just (trying to) make a difference, I can't change the way I'm living\n\nTaking chances that I'm living;\n\nHoping I don't miss it\n\nIn the lonely day I wishes I'm just hoping someone listens, yeah...\n\n\n\nWhen that moment comes\n\nWill you grab it by the horns and run? (Oh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen it's said and done\n\nAre you proud of all that you've become?\n\n\n\nWhen that day arrives\n\nWill you sacrifice for what you love? (Oh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen that moment comes\n\nWill you grab it by the horns and run?\n\n\n\nGrep up on Snoop and Biggie\n\n2Pac and Nirvana\n\nNow I put on for my city like the video to karma\n\nYeah, it only pushed me harder\n\nOnly made me stronger\n\nHad a list of things I wanted, staying only made it longer\n\nYeah, I left that scholarship\n\nTold 'em give it to another kid\n\nThey probably deserved it, N.Y.U. just wasn't workin'\n\nBreaking out I was so nervous;\n\nFamily was hurt, yeah\n\nYou could have the world and it would still never be perfect for you, ah...\n\n\n\nWhen that moment comes\n\nWill you grab it by the horns and run? (Oh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen it's said and done\n\nAre you proud of all that you've become?\n\n\n\nWhen that day arrives\n\nWill you sacrifice for what you love? (Oh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen that moment comes\n\nWill you grab it by the horns and run?\n\n\n\nWhen that day arrives\n\nWill you sacrifice for what you love? (Oh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen that moment comes\n\nWill you grab it by the horns and run?"
