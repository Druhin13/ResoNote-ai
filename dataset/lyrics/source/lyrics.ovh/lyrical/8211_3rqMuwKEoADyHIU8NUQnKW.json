  "lyrics": "She can wear a nightgown to a wedding\r\nA t-shirt to bed\r\nA short skirt in the olden times\r\nSome days, it's wrapped around my head\r\nYou can find my woman dancing in bare feet\r\nOn the couch in a ballroom dress\n\nAnd I love how my baby looks at me\n\nWith arms wrapped 'round my neck\n\n\n\nI said, \"Oh, honey, just like that\"\n\nI give you my loving and you give it right back\n\nI said, \"Oh, honey, just like this\"\n\nHanging on white knuckle grip\n\n\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel something when I kiss you good night\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel something when I open my eyes\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel that I could be your sweetest compromise\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\n\n\nI could wear wing tips to a wedding\n\nFive more ones to bet\n\nA full suit to the party\n\nWe dance 'til all that's left\n\nAnd I kiss my baby with a sweetness\n\nThat only she could bring\n\nAnd I love how my baby touches me\n\nSo play our lover's game\n\n\n\nI said, \"Oh, honey, just like that\"\n\nI give you my loving and you give it right back\n\nI said, \"Oh, honey, just like this\"\n\nHanging on white knuckle grip\n\n\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel something when I kiss you good night\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel something when I open my eyes\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel that I could be your sweetest compromise\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my baby are bass and the beat\n\nLo-fi rhythm, the sweat and the heat\n\nCome on lover, won't you follow my lead\n\nMove on into the night\n\n\n\nBut it's all on my mind\n\nFeel something when I kiss you good night\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel something when I open my eyes\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nFeel that I could be your sweetest compromise\n\nIt's all on my mind\n\nIt's all on my mind"
