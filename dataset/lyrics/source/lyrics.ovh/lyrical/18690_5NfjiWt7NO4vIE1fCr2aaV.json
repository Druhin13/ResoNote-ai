  "lyrics": "One million miles from home\r\nCrushing diamonds out of gold\r\nGet lost in a familiar sky\r\nI'm lost in California tide\r\nStepped in rotation\r\nSo I close my eyes\n\nJust a trip throughout the night\n\n\n\nI've been wandering\n\nHopelessly lost in my own skin\n\nKnowing nothing to say or scream\n\nTo ever bridge this distance\n\nIf every bad dream is on\n\nA coked up me then I'll\n\nTake a truck to every point between us\n\n\n\nJust hold on until the light shines through\n\nÂ‘Cause we'll all feel better\n\nWhen the morning comes\n\nAnd the night's all tangled up\n\nSo when we both drift off to sleep\n\nYou can rest assured\n\nI'll find you in my dreams\n\n\n\nI've been wandering\n\nHopelessly lost in my own skin\n\nKnowing nothing to say or scream\n\nTo ever bridge the distance\n\nIf every bad dream is on\n\nA coked up me then I'll\n\nTake a truck to every point between us\n\n\n\nEvery bad dream is on\n\nI kept humming\n\nEvery bad dream is on\n\nI kept humming\n\nI'll spend my life avoiding sleep\n\n\n\nI've been wandering\n\nHopelessly lost in my own skin\n\nKnowing nothing to say or scream\n\nTo ever bridge this distance\n\n\n\nI've been wandering\n\nHopelessly lost in my own skin\n\nKnowing nothing to say or scream\n\nTo ever bridge this distance\n\nIf every bad dream is on\n\nA coked up me then I'll\n\nTake a truck to every point between us"
