  "lyrics": "Riding the blue\r\nOut the window a patchwork quilt how we build how we move\r\nFrom place to place\r\nWhite lights of the city\r\nAnd the echo of lingering eyes\r\nTravelling alone\n\nSuitcase of stone\n\n\n\nI'd rather be an albatross flying high\n\nAnd in the tail winds looking back at what I left behind\n\nOoh lookin' back at what I left behind\n\nOoh lookin' back at what I left behind\n\n\n\nDon't ask me about the places I've been\n\nI know facebook can't remember a name\n\nI can't remember a name\n\nI can't remember your name\n\nOn the highway of the day long\n\nMy destination is a windowless room\n\nAnother windowless room\n\nAnother windowless room\n\n\n\nI'd rather be an albatross flying high\n\nAnd in the tail winds looking back at what I left behind\n\nOoh lookin' back at what I left behind\n\nOoh lookin' back at what I left behind\n\nOoh lookin' back at what I left behind"
