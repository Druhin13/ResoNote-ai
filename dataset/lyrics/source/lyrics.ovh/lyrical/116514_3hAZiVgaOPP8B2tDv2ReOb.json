  "lyrics": "Who will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\r\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\r\n(1, 2 - 1 ,2 ,3 go)\r\nCan I leave more than flesh?\r\nCan I leave more than bones?\n\nWill these words have an impact?\n\nCan they be carved into stone?\n\nForce yourself to remember\n\nOr choose to forget\n\nYou can't leave this world as a lion\n\nOr just fall asleep in it\n\n\n\nWe break up the ocean, we rise like the tide\n\nWe drown in emotion but reach for the sky\n\nWe're moving mountains, we're making a change\n\nDrink youth from the fountain before it's too late\n\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\n\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\n\n\n\nWill I leave you better off than I found you\n\nShining and pristine\n\nOr will I deceive you, mislead, and destroy you\n\nThe choice is up to me\n\n\n\nWe break up the ocean, we rise like the tide\n\nWe drown in emotion but reach for the sky\n\nWe're moving mountains, we're making a change\n\nDrink youth from the fountain before it's too late\n\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\n\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\n\n\n\nWho will we leave in our wake?\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nWe break up the ocean, we rise like the tide\n\nWe drown in emotion but reach for the sky\n\nWe're moving mountains, we're making a change\n\nDrink youth from the fountain before it's too late\n\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\n\nWho will we leave in our wake, in our wake, in our wake?\n\nWho will we leave in our wake?"
