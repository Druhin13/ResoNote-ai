  "lyrics": "My mother's son\r\nHe can see that I'm done with a world that took more than it gave\r\nWhen we were young and we rose for the sun\r\nDid you ever think twice about this game?\r\n'Cause you're my brother\n\nI know you from before\n\nBefore we both were born\n\nAnd you're my other\n\nNever asking more, taking all the falls\n\n\n\nGrown in a place\n\nWe were shown to make space for the good, the humble, and the kind\n\nThen until now you could always see how\n\nI was scared when I felt myself unwind\n\n\n\n'Cause you're my brother\n\nI know you from before\n\nBefore we both were born\n\nAnd you're my other\n\nNever asking more, taking all the falls\n\nAnd you're my brother\n\nI know you from before\n\nBefore we both were born\n\nAnd you're my other\n\nNever asking more, taking all the falls\n\nI know you from before"
