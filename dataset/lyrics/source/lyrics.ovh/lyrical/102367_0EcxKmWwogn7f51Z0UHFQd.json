  "lyrics": "I used to carry my past like a duffel bag\r\nIt's been hurting my head and breaking my back\r\nBut when you live in the rear view you just crash\r\nOh, I'm done carrying my past like that\r\nI'm travelling light\n\nI'm laying it down\n\nAll those demons I keep dragging round\n\nI'm cutting the ties\n\nI'm dropping the weight\n\nWith all my hurt and my regrets and my mistakes\n\nI'm tired of living unforgiven\n\nSo i'm travelling light\n\nOh, I'm travelling light\n\n\n\nDon't lay the blame on anyone else\n\nI'm always last to forgive myself\n\nWell starting over is overdue\n\nAnd these old boots sure feel brand new\n\n\n\nI'm travelling light\n\nI'm laying it down\n\nAll those demons I keep dragging round\n\nI'm cutting the ties\n\nI'm dropping the weight\n\nWith all my hurt and my regrets and my mistakes\n\nI'm tired of living unforgiven\n\nSo I'm travelling light\n\nOh, I'm travelling light\n\n\n\nAll I'm gonna take it a little bit of faith\n\nAnd it's all gonna be alright\n\nI only got room for some love and some truth\n\nAnd a little bit of peace of mind\n\n\n\nSo I'm travelling light\n\nAnd I'm laying it down\n\nAll those demons, I left 'em buried in the ground\n\nI'm cutting the ties\n\nI'm dropping the weight\n\nI got a one way ticket towards them better days\n\nI'm tired of living unforgiven\n\nSo I'm travelling light\n\nOh, I'm travelling light\n\nI'm travelling light"
