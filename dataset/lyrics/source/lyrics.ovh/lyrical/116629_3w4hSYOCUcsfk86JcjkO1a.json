  "lyrics": "Me and my cousin were walking one day\r\nBy the Dairy Queen drive-thru down by the highway\r\nAnd he found some fâ€Œlowers, a busted bouquet\r\nAnd he put a hydrangea in his hair\r\nSome kids at the Dairy Queen were calling him gay\n\nAnd then to my surprise I knew just what to say\n\nI said, \"boys, if you're looking for your worthiness\n\nWell it's already there.\"\n\n\n\nGloria\n\nNo more nightmares of a lack of love\n\nNo need to win the race to face your father\n\n\n\nMe and my cousin were at the arcade\n\nIn a fathom of blood, we were constantly slain\n\nAnd we watched the progress of our three-letter names\n\nTill we stumbled outside to the night air\n\n\n\nAnd there was a man, with a coat and a cane\n\nHe was mumbling things about the world gone insane\n\nHe said, \"boys, if you're looking for your innocence\n\nWell it's already there.\"\n\n\n\nGloria\n\nNo more nightmares of a lack of love\n\nNo need to win the race to face your father\n\nGloria\n\nNo more nightmares of a lack of love\n\nNo need to win the race to face your father\n\nGloria\n\nNo more nightmares of a lack of love\n\nNo need to win the race to face your father\n\nGloria\n\nNo more nightmares of a lack of love\n\nNo need to win the race to face your father"
