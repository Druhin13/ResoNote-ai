  "lyrics": "Somebody said you got a new friend\r\nBut does she love you better than I can?\r\nAnd there's a big black sky over my town\r\nI know where you're at I bet she's around\r\nAnd yeah I know it's stupid, but I just gotta see it for myself\n\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh\n\nAnd I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh\n\nI keep dancing on my own\n\n\n\nI just wanna dance all night\n\nAnd I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line, yeah\n\nStilettos on broken bottles\n\nI'm spinning around in circles\n\n\n\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh\n\nAnd I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh\n\nI keep dancing on my own\n\nAnd oh, nah\n\n\n\nSo far away, but still so near\n\nThe lights come on, the music dies\n\nBut you don't see me standing here\n\nI just came to say goodbye\n\n\n\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh\n\nI keep dancing on my own\n\nAnd oh, nah\n\nSaid I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh? no\n\nAnd I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh no\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh\n\nAnd I keep dancing on my own\n\n\n\nSo far away, but still so near\n\nThe lights come on, the music dies\n\nBut you don't see me standing here"
