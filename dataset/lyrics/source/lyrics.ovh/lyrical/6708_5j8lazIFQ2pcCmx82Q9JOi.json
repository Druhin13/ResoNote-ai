  "lyrics": "I wrote a pretty pretty song\r\n'Bout a pretty pretty girl last night\r\nAnd I feel pretty damn lucky to get a chance to hold her tight\r\nAnd I wonder is this heaven?\r\n'Cause she’s softer than satin\r\nAnd I only have one thing on my mind\n\nSo hear me when I say that she’s\n\n\n\nAll\n\nAnd then she is so much more\n\nMy baby, she’s all\n\nAnd feels better than sex on drugs\n\n\n\nI’ma take a wild guess and say she only gets free rides\n\nAnd she’s gon’ need it, believe it\n\n'Cause she’s always outta breath\n\nFrom running right across my mind\n\nAnd I wonder where she’s off to\n\n'Cause I can’t live without you\n\nAnd I only have one thing on my mind\n\nSo hear me when I say that she’s\n\n\n\nAll\n\nAnd then she is so much more\n\nMy baby, she’s all\n\nAnd feels better than sex on drugs\n\n\n\nThat’s right, she’s all mine, and she ain’t never gon’ leave me\n\nThat’s right, she’s all mine, and God bless her for being with me\n\nThat’s right, she’s all mine, and she ain’t never gon’ leave me\n\nThat’s right, she’s all mine, and God bless her, God bless her for me"
