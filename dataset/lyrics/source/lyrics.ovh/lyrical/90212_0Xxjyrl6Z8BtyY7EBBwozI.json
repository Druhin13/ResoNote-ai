  "lyrics": "There's something about this girl, some kind of magic\r\nI swear she cast a spell on me\r\nNot the first time, might be the last\r\nCan't let this moment slip away\r\nTry to find the words, none survived with me\n\nAir of confidence, but I can barely breathe\n\n\n\nShe's without a care, electrified and hell-bent\n\nA thousand volts igniting me\n\nThe waves crash over me, far below but I breach\n\nThe undertow, my reverie\n\n\n\nSadness in her smile, your love, it's been a while\n\nNear and far away, she chases it each day\n\nA promise to come back, all the while, still waiting\n\nSeems it lost its way\n\n\n\nOut of reach, just too hard to reach\n\nYou're letting your love slip away\n\nOut of reach, yeah, it's hard to reach\n\nThere's another day\n\nAlthough you're hurting and afraid\n\nYou're stronger than yesterday"
