  "lyrics": "Smash my heart in pieces, it looks so good on the floor\r\nPeople think it's fun and games but my life is really lonely\r\nAin't nobody that can save me, ain't nobody that console me\r\nI'm an emo little boy and I want someone to hold me\r\nGot my money like a blanket and I hold it when I'm lonely\n\nGot my blanket and my bottle, yeah, you know I like to sip\n\nSaid her lips taste like morphine, asked me if I want a drip\n\nI'm in bed when I'm lonely, I'm in bed when I'm sick\n\nI'm in bed on a flight and I'm in bed on a trip\n\nYou say you love me, I know you're lyin'\n\nYou say you're sorry, well, thanks for tryin'\n\nGot a new life, not invited\n\nGot a date now and I'm excited\n\nIs my meant to be being where I wanna be\n\nSo I turn off my phone and then I go to sleep\n\nSpent a month on the road, every night a new bed\n\nWhen I touch back home, could've sworn I was dead\n\nOnly focus was important so it's back to work\n\nAlways focus on my money, people think I'm a jerk\n\nYeah, I really, really want it, I can't waste no time\n\nEverybody gettin' money, but I get mine\n\n\n\nThink it's fun and games\n\nAnd my life is so lonely\n\nCan you please hold me?"
