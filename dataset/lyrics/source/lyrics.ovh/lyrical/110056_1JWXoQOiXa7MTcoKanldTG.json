  "lyrics": "Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair \nTalkin' to some rich folk that you know \nWell I hope you won't see me in my ragged company \nWell, you know I could never be alone \nTake me down little Susie, take me down \n\nI know you think you're the queen of the underground \n\nAnd you can send me dead flowers every morning \n\nSend me dead flowers by the mail \n\nSend me dead flowers to my wedding \n\nAnd I won't forget to put roses on your grave \n\n\n\nWell when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac \n\nMaking bets on Kentucky Derby Day \n\nAh, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon \n\nAnd another girl to take my pain away \n\n\n\nTake me down little Susie, take me down \n\nI know you think you're the queen of the underground \n\nAnd you can send me dead flowers every morning \n\nSend me dead flowers by the mail \n\nSend me dead flowers to my wedding \n\nAnd I won't forget to put roses on your grave \n\n\n\nTake me down little Susie, take me down \n\nI know you think you're the queen of the underground \n\nAnd you can send me dead flowers every morning \n\nSend me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail \n\nSay it with dead flowers in my wedding \n\nAnd I won't forget to put roses on your grave \n\nNo, I won't forget to put roses on your grave"
