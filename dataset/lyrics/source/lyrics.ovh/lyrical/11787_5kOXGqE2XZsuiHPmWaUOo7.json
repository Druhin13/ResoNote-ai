  "lyrics": "I'm just a man with a vision\r\nWho's growing more blind everyday\r\nEyes of a child now in ruins\r\nScared of everything he became\r\nMy voice wasn't loud enough for you to listen\n\nYour words weren't strong enough for me to stay here\n\n\n\nCause I feel your love has always been empty\n\nJust a way to sink your teeth into me\n\nBut the truth is we built our house in a tree\n\nWe build the roads we walk upon\n\n\n\nI feel you have the worst intentions\n\nControlling everyone but me\n\nMy voice wasn't loud enough\n\nYour words weren't strong enough\n\n\n\nCause I feel your love has always been empty\n\nJust a way to sink your teeth into me\n\nBut the truth is we built our house in a tree\n\nWe build the roads we walk upon\n\n\n\nAre you alive or are you just living?\n\nAre you alive or are you just living?\n\n\n\nYou don't get it! You'll never get it!\n\nDo you have a life or are you just living?\n\nYou don't get it! You'll never get it!\n\nDo you have a life or are you just living?\n\n\n\nI feel your love has always been empty\n\nJust a way to sink your teeth into me...\n\n\n\nCause I feel your love has always been empty (Been empty)\n\nJust a way to sink your teeth into me\n\nBut the truth is we built our house in a tree\n\nWe build the roads we walk upon\n\nWe build the roads we walk upon"
