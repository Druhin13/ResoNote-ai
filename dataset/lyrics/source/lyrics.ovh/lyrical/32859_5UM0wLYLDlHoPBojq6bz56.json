  "lyrics": "What was I thinking trying to put words in your mouth?\r\nI should just leave it\r\nAnd let you figure it out\r\nIt's louder in the silence\r\nAs I try, I try\r\nTo keep it together, but you're bringing the house down\n\n\n\nI can feel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you\n\nFeel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning\n\n\n\nWhat were you thinking?\n\nI gave you the perfect out\n\nYou didn't believe it\n\nThat we could turn it around\n\nShow me that it matters and I'll try, I'll try\n\nTo keep it together, but you're bringing the house down\n\n\n\nI can feel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you\n\nFeel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning\n\nFeel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you\n\nFeel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning\n\n\n\nI've let it go\n\nOnce or twice\n\nI've let it go, even though my feelings were right\n\nAnd now I know it's hard to fight\n\nNow I know you came at the wrong time\n\n\n\nI can feel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you\n\nFeel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning\n\nI can feel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to fuel that fire in you\n\nFeel it burning out\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning\n\nAnd I won't stop trying to keep that fire burning"
