  "lyrics": "Don't come over, I don't want your company\r\nI think you ought to spend a little bit of time alone\r\nYou say you don't need it, but damn, I know you got to have it\r\nI'll tell you why, it's stronger when it's on its own\r\nOoh, I got eleven on the inside\n\nThis hell is nothing new\n\nIf there's a heaven on the other side\n\nYou better pray I don't get through\n\n\n\nI'm not better than you, I'm just better\n\nI've been fighting just to breathe my whole damn life\n\nWhat do you think you know and what do you want to know?\n\nI never thought I'd let the truth tell all my lies...\n\nMy lies, yeah\n\n\n\nOoh, I got eleven on the inside\n\nThis hell is nothing new\n\nIf there's a heaven on the other side\n\nYou better pray I don't get through\n\n\n\nBleeding for the savages\n\nYou bill me for the damages\n\nWhen you're dealing with the devil\n\nYou know you got to watch your back\n\nStack, ya thick, ya slick\n\nThey pull you in a killer embrace\n\nTo your face\n\nYou can trust 'em, love 'em\n\nUntil you start to turn it away\n\nAnd then they throw it all away\n\n\n\nOoh, I got eleven on the inside\n\nThis hell is nothing new\n\nIf there's a heaven on the other side\n\nYou better pray I don't get through\n\n\n\nOoh, I got eleven on the inside\n\nThis hell is nothing new\n\nIf there's a heaven on the other side\n\nYou better pray I don't get through"
