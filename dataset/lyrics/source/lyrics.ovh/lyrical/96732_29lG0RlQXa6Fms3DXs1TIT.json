  "lyrics": "(Ah) The world on fire, let's celebrate\r\nLet's have a toast while we sit and we watch\r\nThe whole world go up in flames (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)\r\nWe lost our minds (Lost it), we going cray (Cray cray)\r\nWe let a racist orange man be the president\r\nAin't that just fuckin' great? (The fuck, man)\n\nBut we just runnin' around, chasin' the lettuce\n\nI bought a Bentley, still feel pathetic\n\nIce on my wrist, still feel depression\n\nMusic my therapy, it's my obsession\n\nSpittin' these bars, handin' out lessons\n\nDon't go to church, but I'm makin' confessions\n\nFly like a bird, makin' impressions\n\nI got the answers, just give me your questions\n\n\n\nWe've been caught in the fire\n\nWe've lost our desire\n\nWe're beaten and blue\n\nI pray we save us from ourselves (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)\n\n'Cause nobody else can do that for you (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nI feel like—\n\n\n\nOne of one, bitch, I'm original\n\nAnd I feel like Steph Curry with the finger roll\n\nAnd I feel like Aaron Rodgers with the give and go\n\nHope this click inside your head like a metronome\n\nHow many times do the kid gotta run\n\nTo let all of you know I'm the truth\n\nNot chasing people's opinion of me\n\n'Cause I really got nothing to prove\n\nNot even ill when I'm makin' these songs\n\nMy soul is up in the booth\n\nFound my place, I'll never leave\n\nIt's me, the crowd, they singin' free like (Ayy)\n\nMy generation is the truth (Ayy-Ayy), yeah\n\nI believe in me and you (Ayy), yeah\n\nBitch, the future is the youth (Ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy)\n\nLet me show you what we do\n\nLet me show you what we—\n\n\n\nWe've been caught in the fire\n\nWe've lost our desire\n\nWe're beaten and blue\n\nI pray we save us from ourselves (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)\n\n'Cause nobody else can do that for you (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\nI feel like—\n\n\n\nWe wanna be free\n\nJust wanna feel something\n\nJust wanna feel something\n\nWe wanna be free\n\nJust wanna feel something\n\nJust wanna feel something"
