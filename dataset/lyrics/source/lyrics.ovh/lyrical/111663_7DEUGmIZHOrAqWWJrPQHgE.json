  "lyrics": "It's like I'm walking on a highway, staring straight into the sun\r\nWith the universe around me waiting for me to fall down\r\nYour love is like a junkie, just a little loaded, huh\r\nYour words are like a whiskey river rolling off of your tongue\r\nBut you won't burn out this starfire\n\nThis feeling is dancing in my flames\n\nThrow me and I'll just burn brighter\n\nOh, you can't burn out this starfire\n\nNo matter what you say\n\n\n\nI won't ever be perfection, ever be your golden child\n\nI'm not spinning on this planet just for me to make you smile\n\nI love my crooked halo, hell, I won't apologize\n\nYou can touch it all you want, but no matter how you try\n\n\n\nYou won't burn out this starfire\n\nThis feeling is dancing in my flames\n\nThrow me and I'll just burn brighter\n\nNo, you can't burn out this starfire\n\nNo matter what you say\n\n\n\nOh you ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nOh you can try, but you ain't ever\n\nYou ain't ever, oh nah, nah, nah\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oooh\n\n\n\nYou won't burn out this starfire\n\nThis feeling is dancing in my flames\n\nThrow me and I'll just burn brighter\n\nNo, you can't burn out this starfire\n\nNo matter what you say\n\nYeah, yeah, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh\n\n\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out\n\nYou ain't ever, ever gonna burn me out"
