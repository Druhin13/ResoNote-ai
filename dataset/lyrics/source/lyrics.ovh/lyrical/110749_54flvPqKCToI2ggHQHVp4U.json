  "lyrics": "My girl's on a train\r\nShe's going far away\r\nShe's never coming back\r\nShe gives me heart attacks\r\nWalking in the day\n\nThe sunshine's in my way\n\nShe's asking for a talk\n\nRunning down my block\n\n\n\nShe'll never be the same\n\nShe'll never be the same\n\nAnd I'm the one to blame\n\nWhen you got off that train\n\nOff that train\n\n\n\nWalking up the stairs\n\nShe doesn't even care\n\nShe's the one that left\n\nLeading on the path\n\n\n\nShe left there torn\n\nPierced like a thorn\n\nIt was all my fault\n\nShe forgot about the call\n\n\n\nShe'll never be the same\n\nShe'll never be the same\n\nAnd I'm the one to blame\n\nWhen you got off that train\n\nOff that train\n\n\n\nI said that she's clich√©\n\nShe said, \"What did you say?\"\n\nOf course I said nothing\n\nGo sew your old buttons\n\n\n\nIn the garage\n\nI gave you your corsage\n\nIt wasn't right\n\nI forgot about the fight\n\n\n\nShe'll never be the same\n\nShe'll never be the same\n\nAnd I'm the one to blame\n\nWhen you got off that train\n\nOff that train"
