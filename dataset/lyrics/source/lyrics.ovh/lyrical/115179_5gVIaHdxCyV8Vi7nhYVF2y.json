  "lyrics": "One horse town, restless soul\r\nWondering where the river and the freight trains go\r\nTwo lane road, hometown roots\r\nWe're never gonna hold back my goodbye boots\r\nJust waiting on ready or not\r\nYou know the first chance I got\n\n\n\nI got blacktop gone, four lane fast\n\nTopping off the tank with some never look back\n\nChase that sun, race that wind\n\nWith them horses that you can't fence in\n\nFree like a freeway, high on a highway\n\nPacking up a getaway soul\n\nGetting blacktop gone\n\n\n\nGirl you look like you might\n\nDo a little running out on the wild side\n\nI bet that kiss could slow me down\n\nBut if you're looking for Mr. Stick Around\n\nThat ain't me\n\nIt's like I'm born to be\n\n\n\nBlacktop gone, four lane fast\n\nTopping off the tank with some never look back\n\nChase that sun, race that wind\n\nWith them horses that you can't fence in\n\nFree like a freeway, high on a highway\n\nPacking up a getaway soul\n\nGetting blacktop gone\n\n\n\nI'm just a good to go, one night show\n\nI'm ready to rock 'til I'm ready to roll\n\n\n\nAnd get blacktop gone, four lane fast\n\nTopping off the tank with some never look back\n\nChase that sun, race that wind\n\nWith them horses that you can't fence in\n\nFree like a freeway, high on a highway\n\nPacking up a getaway soul\n\nGetting blacktop gone\n\n\n\nBlacktop gone\n\nGirl we're getting blacktop gone"
