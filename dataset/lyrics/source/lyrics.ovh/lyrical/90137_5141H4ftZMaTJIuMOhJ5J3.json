  "lyrics": "You know I love you so bad\r\nI don't believe in love\r\nYou know I love you so bad, so bad\r\nYou know I love you so bad\r\nLike the kid in the back of the classroom\r\nWho can't do the math cos he can't see the blackboard, so bad\n\nYou know I love you so bad\n\nLike the kid skipping class in the bathrooms\n\nSneaking cigarettes underneath the football bleachers baby, so bad\n\nYou know I love you so bad\n\nLike the kids growing up to be criminals\n\nTearing pages out the back of the hymnals\n\nLove notes baby, so bad\n\nStill remember so bad\n\nThe nights mom got drunker than dad did\n\nShe told me, \"never hang out with the bad kids\"\n\nWhat can you say to that?\n\nI always knew I was bad\n\nAlways dreaming so they called me the Spaceman\n\nYou first kissed me in your parent's blue basement\n\nI wanted you baby so bad\n\nSometimes we got out of hand\n\nWe bought drugs from a parking attendant\n\nBut sober nights in your car were transcendent\n\nI loved you baby so bad\n\nYou know I loved you so bad\n\nSomehow you got yourself accepted to college\n\nYou said there had to be a way out of all this\n\nGarbage small town rat trap\n\nYou moved away that was that\n\nYou still send me the occasional email\n\nI got a dumb job working in retail\n\nI miss you baby so bad, so bad\n\nI drew your name in the sand\n\nI came to the beach cos we used to go here\n\nI watched the blue wave cover it over\n\nAnd do what the ocean does best\n\nI know the past is the past\n\nThen again, the present's nothing without it\n\nI feel fine, don't even feel sad about it\n\nI just love you baby so bad\n\nSo bad so bad"
