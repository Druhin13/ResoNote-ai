  "lyrics": "Once upon a time there was a concept\r\nSomeday we can all skip the nonsense\r\nWork hard let the rewards connect and\r\nMaybe we can soup up all the trash off the front steps\r\nSilly man he believed in that ethic\r\nSeems planted the needle to the wreck\n\nIt's in the plans that he set out to perfect\n\nBut every few steps was a thief with a message\n\nWho speaks up for them half nights\n\nLet's seperate the players and the mascots\n\nLittle miss success is a back dropping\n\nYou kind of look like a jack pot\n\n\n\nGive me what you got or get got\n\nAin't no getting off at the next stop\n\nDon't get caught with a wet top\n\nI thought the best shot was the best spot, guess not\n\n\n\nThey all get mad at you so see through\n\nNot much they had to do but read through\n\nTurn off the attitude they need you\n\nNo time to act a fool, just be cool [x2]\n\n\n\nNow keep your defense up right,\n\nNo choice but to be tense up tight,\n\nNot one type baby ever just might throw shots at your body, character even love fight\n\nBut why they gotta turn them wheels in?\n\nTry not to hurt them feelings\n\nBut burn pride or burn that ceiling\n\nIn between the search and the curse of the dreams, man\n\nGirl look at how they stare at cha\n\nPass judgement to gather their chapters\n\nCome back the year after the happily ever after\n\nAnd I wonder what the world'll look like from their ladder\n\nAnd now you had it up to right there\n\nHey mama put the kid back in the high-chair\n\nAct like you care that life ain't fair, nah let them finish up their nightmare\n\n\n\nThey all get mad at you so see through\n\nNot much they had to do but read through\n\nTurn off the attitude they need you\n\nNo time to act a fool, just be cool [x2]\n\n\n\nAnd when they open up them cracks you gotta overreact\n\nIt don't stop it just seems so relaxed\n\nYou know they never cross over them tracks\n\nWith a scarf like that they keep pullin you back\n\nIs that really how it works now?\n\nIs they hurt style even worthwhile?\n\nReturn it with a smirk or a smile\n\nTake yourself off the dirtpile when you had your first child\n\nIt's too easy to call it envy, everybody wanna be all they can be\n\nGraffiti makes them feel so heavy but they all get friendly when your walls are empty\n\nIt's always the same approach, they just want a little fiend to hold\n\nYou can't save they soul, so just chase your goals\n\nLet em hate far away or let em hate up close\n\n\n\nThey all get mad at you so see through\n\nNot much they had to do but read through\n\nTurn off the attitude they need you\n\nNo time to act a fool, just be cool [x2]"
