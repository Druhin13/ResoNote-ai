  "lyrics": "When did we forget\r\nAll the crazy things that made us feel so part of it?\r\nOur youth, so confident\r\nWe played our heartstrings\r\nNot caring if it ends\r\nTry to learn to let go of all those things that tie you down\n\nGet rid of it, the voice inside that tells me that\n\nI'm scared, yeah, scared as shit\n\nBut I wanna let go of it now\n\nSo someone tell me\n\n\n\nWhy so serious?\n\nWhy are we so serious?\n\nOh, why so serious?\n\nWhen did we get like this?\n\nI still remember we weren't grown up like this\n\nOooh, oh\n\n\n\nI don't seem to get all the things that are happening\n\nAnd I can't make sense of everything that's inside my head\n\nBut I keep on thinking, there's gotta be something said\n\nOh, seems we've lost it\n\nThat spark inside that tells us it's all nonsense\n\nStop being so cautious\n\nWith every mistake there comes a lesson learned\n\nSo someone tell me\n\n\n\nWhy so serious? (Serious)\n\nWhy are we so serious?\n\nOh, why so serious? (Serious)\n\nWhen did we get like this?\n\nI still remember we weren't grown up like this\n\nOooh, oh\n\nWhy so serious? (Serious)\n\nWhy are we so serious?\n\nOh, why so serious? (Serious)\n\nCan someone tell me\n\nDid we forget about\n\nLiving with no regrets?\n\nOooh, oh\n\n\n\nI wanna live in the now\n\nI'm not gonna live in the past\n\nDon't wanna care about what-ifs\n\n'Cause what if those things don't last?\n\nAnd I wanna live with no regrets\n\nI wanna live in the now\n\nI'm not gonna live in the past\n\nDon't wanna care about what-ifs\n\n'Cause what if those things don't last?\n\nAnd I wanna live with no regrets\n\nSo someone tell me\n\nWhy so serious?\n\n\n\nWhy so serious? (Serious)\n\nWhy are we so serious?\n\nOh, why so serious? (Serious)\n\nWhen did we get like this?\n\nI still remember we weren't grown up like this\n\nOooh, oh\n\nWhy so serious? (Serious)\n\nWhy are we so serious?\n\nOh, why so serious? (Serious)\n\nCan someone tell me\n\nDid we forget about\n\nLiving with no regrets?"
