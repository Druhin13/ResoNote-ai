  "lyrics": "You took my sadness out of context\r\nAt the mariners apartment complex\r\nI ain't no candle in the wind\r\nI'm the board, the lightning, the thunder\r\nKind of girl who's gonna make you wonder\n\nWho you are and who you've been\n\n\n\nAnd who I've been is with you on these beaches\n\nYour Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness\n\nMaybe I could save you from your sins\n\n\n\nSo, kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus\n\nMy, my, my, you found this, you need this\n\nTake a deep breath, baby, let me in\n\n\n\nYou lose your way, just take my hand\n\nYou're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again\n\nDon't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am\n\nI'm your man\n\nI'm your man\n\n\n\nThey mistook my kindness for weakness\n\nI fucked up, I know that, but Jesus\n\nCan't a girl just do the best she can?\n\n\n\nCatch a wave and take in the sweetness\n\nThink about it, the darkness, the deepness\n\nAll the things that make me who I am\n\n\n\nAnd who I am is a big time believer\n\nThat people can change, but you don't have to leave her\n\nWhen everyone's talking, you can make a stand\n\n\n\n'Cause even in the dark I feel your resistance\n\nYou can see my heart burning in the distance\n\nBaby, baby, baby, I'm your man (yeah)\n\n\n\nYou lose your way, just take my hand\n\nYou're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again\n\nDon't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am\n\nI'm your man\n\nI'm your man\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch a wave and take in the sweetness\n\nTake in the sweetness\n\nYou want this, you need this\n\nAre you ready for it?\n\nAre you ready for it?\n\nAre you ready for it?"
