  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Love On Repeat par Pianos Become The Teeth\r\nThe slow motion sin\nThe dead summer dance again\nMy chassy knows what could've been\n\nI see how it happens now\nIt's all stretched out before me\n\nMy prime was a still frame\nIn your movie days, so late\n\nWe're close to dying twice\nProjector of our life\nOld Hollywood, holy bound\n\nI see how it happens now\nIt's all stretched out before me\n\nWhat could've been?\n\nMy prime was a still frame\nIn your movie days, so late\nThose sirens sing on 42nd Street\nAnd they've been calling my name out\n\nWhat in you gets me so carried away?\nI can't say yet, I can't\n\nLove on repeat, it's life again\nIt's my flesh, my own blood\nYou vexed and sparked right from the start\nSo come and remind us\n\nWhat in you gets me so carried away?\nI can't say yet, I can't"
