  "lyrics": "Keep reaching\r\nKeep dreaming\r\nYou’ll never win if you never try\r\nSo kill your doubts, keep hope alive\r\nYou see it takes perseverance, takes more than ears to hear it\n\nTakes more than tears to feel it, takes more than pain to heal it, regain your spirit, don’t take your time\n\nGotta face your grind, gotta take your mind and clear it\n\nNo time to kill, you got the skills behind the wheel now steer it\n\nI tried being lazy it really wasn’t me\n\nCause a man that doesn’t work now that’s a man that doesn’t eat\n\nAnd I can see my future obstacles preparing there defeat\n\nCause I’m standing in the mirror and I’m staring at a beast\n\nCan’t face defeat, and I can’t be weak because this struggle is tough\n\nGotta bring that heat, get back to your feet and say enough is enough\n\nYou see I fell to the ground looked around and found I was down on my luck\n\nSo stepped my game my pride my confidence and stamina up\n\nAnd now I’m smashing all my foes\n\nI’m passing all my foes, cause I got passion and it shows\n\nGo go gadget reach my goals\n\nIf you came to see greatness just pass me the mic\n\nThis is what I tell the people when they ask me advice\n\n\n\nKeep reaching\n\nKeep dreaming\n\nYou’ll never win if you never try\n\nSo kill your doubts, keep hope alive\n\n\n\nAnd I know this world is cold\n\nThe struggles getting old\n\nNo aces in my hole\n\nBut it doesn’t mean I’ll fold\n\nYou see the crown is what I want\n\nNo that’s what I need\n\nTruthfully I want success as bad as I want to breath\n\nI got to succeed got to believe got to achieve\n\nGot to proceed even if I gotta bleed\n\nSo I roll up my sleeves, and promise I’ll never leave\n\nWas behind for so long, now I’m taking the lead\n\nMy mentality right now is like winning or die\n\nOur goals start from the ground and they end in the sky\n\nNow it seems I’m growing wings cause I’m beginning to fly\n\nCause you’ll never reach your goals if you’re not willing to try\n\nAnd now I’m smashing all my foes\n\nI’m passing all my foes, cause I got passion and it shows\n\nGo go gadget reach my goals\n\nIf you came to see greatness just pass me the mic\n\nThis is what I tell the people when they ask me advice\n\n\n\nI got what it takes and I\n\nWill give it everything I got\n\nNot be afraid to take my spot\n\nLose, nor will I stop\n\n\n\nIt seems like everyone’s afraid to fail or afraid to lose\n\nBut you fail to realize that you’re losing right now by not ever giving yourself that chance\n\nIn that state of mind you will forever remain\n\nImprisoned by your own limitations\n\n\n\nLost one of my best friends to a disastrous life\n\nWe all seem to fall apart whenever tragedy strikes\n\nWhen I fall to my knees from hazardous heights\n\nAnd I look up to the sky and ask for advice I hear\n\n\n\nKeep reaching\n\nKeep dreaming\n\nYou’ll never win if you never try\n\nSo kill your doubts, keep hope alive\n\nKeep reaching\n\nKeep dreaming\n\nYou’ll never strive, if you never try\n\nSo through the pain, keep hope alive"
