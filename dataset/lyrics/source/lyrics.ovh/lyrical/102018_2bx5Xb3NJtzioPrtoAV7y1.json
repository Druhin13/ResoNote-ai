  "lyrics": "I want you to know, you're not alone\r\nEverything you are and everything you're not\r\nWhen happiness dies and the pain, it will come\r\nLife's funny, it's a game we play\r\nYou know we run\n\nI wonder when I get back home\n\nIs there really any way of knowing\n\nIf I did this right\n\nCause I'm just not sure if I'm ready for it\n\nAnd should I even try it out\n\nIf I don't know where I'm going\n\nSo I close my eyes, and I say my prayers\n\nMaybe life will show me\n\n\n\nAre you looking out? Are you looking in?\n\nWhere does this start? And where does it end?\n\nThe night can get so dark, in this dream we're living in\n\nWhere does this start? Tell me where does it end\n\n\n\nThe universe is hard sometimes\n\nJust like an angry mother\n\nThen your life can be so hard sometimes\n\nWe gotta hold on to each other\n\n\n\nAre you looking out? Are you looking in?\n\nWhere does this start? And where does it end?\n\nThe night can get so dark, in this dream we're living in\n\nWhere does this start? Tell me where does it end\n\n\n\nI wonder when I get back home\n\nIs there really any way of knowing\n\nIf I did this right\n\nCause I'm just not sure if I'm ready for it\n\nAnd should I even try it out\n\nIf I don't know where I'm going\n\nSo I close my eyes, and I say my prayers\n\nMaybe life will show me\n\n\n\nI want you to know, you're not alone\n\nEverything you are and everything you're not\n\nWhen happiness dies and the pain, it will come\n\nLife's funny, it's a game we play\n\nYou know we run"
