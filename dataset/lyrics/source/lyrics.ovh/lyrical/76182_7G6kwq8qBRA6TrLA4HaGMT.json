  "lyrics": "As I walk along the lonely shore\r\nOn life I'm wondering\r\nDon't know why is it so hard to let go\r\nAll that I believed\r\nLeave the child inside me on the road\r\nFor the man I must become\n\nI hope I find the place where I belong\n\n\n\nThe night is dark, I need to find\n\nA lighthouse on the coast\n\nIt should lead me and it's light my mind\n\nAnd drive away my ghosts\n\nI early learned the power of love\n\nBut many times I've failed\n\nAs I could free myself from all my chains\n\nAs I could free myself from all my chains\n\n\n\nHere I go a castaway\n\nTry to turn my storm to silence\n\nHere I go against the dark to find the light\n\nHere I go against the rain\n\nTo find my soaking soul asylum\n\n‘Til I find peace for my broken heart\n\n\n\nMy prideful mind is always false to my pure and humble heart\n\nAlways leads me to the wrong decision ‘till I fall apart\n\nResponsibility, it must win over happiness\n\nBut my idealistic soul won't acquiesce\n\nBut my idealistic soul won't acquiesce\n\n\n\nHere I go a castaway\n\nTry to turn my storm to silence\n\nHere I go against the dark to find the light\n\nHere I go against the rain\n\nTo find my soaking soul asylum\n\n‘Til I find peace for my broken heart\n\n\n\nSo I find myself in doubt\n\nBut I'm holding on\n\nIt's a lifelong blackout\n\nBut I'm holding on\n\nI feel I lost my route\n\nBut I'm holding on\n\nDesperately I'm crying out\n\nThat I'm holding on\n\n\n\nHere I go a castaway\n\nTry to turn my storm to silence\n\nHere I go against the dark to find the light\n\nHere I go against the rain\n\nTo find my soaking soul asylum\n\n‘Til I find peace for my broken heart\n\n‘Til I find peace for my broken heart"
