  "lyrics": "We started so sure, with nothing to hide\r\nA little naive, a little\r\nRunning into the future hand-in-hand\r\nWe didn't hear the truth\r\nWe didn't believe\n\nThat love could be a shade that turns to jealousy\n\nNow our hearts break just from a wandering glance\n\n\n\nFear comes in the dead of night\n\nWhen I look into your eyes\n\nWonder if you felt a spark\n\nWith someone else when we're apart\n\nBut it's alright, it's alright\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nCovenant\n\n\n\nI know it sounds crazy to say we can feel\n\nThings for other people if our love is real\n\nBut to choose our love makes it stronger in the end\n\n\n\nFear comes in the dead of night\n\nWhen I look into your eyes\n\nWonder if you felt a spark\n\nWith someone else when we're apart\n\nBut it's alright, it's alright\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nCovenant\n\n\n\nFear comes in the dead of night\n\nAnd you look into my eyes\n\nWonder if I felt a spark\n\nWith someone else when we're apart\n\nBut it's alright, it's alright\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nCovenant\n\n\n\nI won't run when it hurts\n\nI won't run from the moments of doubt\n\nI've given you all of me\n\nI don't care what it costs, I'll never leave\n\nI won't run when it hurts\n\nI won't run from the moments of doubt\n\nI've given you all of me\n\nI don't care what it costs, I'll never leave\n\n\n\nFear comes in the dead of night\n\nWhen I look into your eyes\n\nWonder if you felt a spark\n\nWith someone else when we're apart\n\nBut it's alright, it's alright\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nWe trust our love is\n\nCovenant"
