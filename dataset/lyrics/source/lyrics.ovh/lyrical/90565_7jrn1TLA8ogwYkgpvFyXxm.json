  "lyrics": "Say what's on your mind\r\nCause I can’t read you now\r\nMy hands can't figure out\r\nHow to hold you like they don't know you\r\nWanna dream crazy dreams\n\nBe a team like we used to\n\nShare the drinks, sleeping bag, anything like we used to\n\nWish I could lose myself in you like I used to, like I used to do\n\n\n\nYour heart is out of reach, but you’re so close to me\n\nYour skin don't feel as deep as it used to\n\nLike that I don't know you\n\n\n\nWanna fall in love, be in love, be enough, like I used to\n\nSail again, 4 am, lake Michigan, like we used to\n\nWish I could give myself to you, like I used to\n\nLike I used to do\n\n\n\nLike I used to do\n\nLike I used to do\n\n\n\nSilence breaks the truth I know you're tired too\n\nWe hold on to each other not cause we mean it, but cause we need in\n\n\n\nWant you to fight me back, love me fast, drive me mad like you used to\n\nSecond class, fuck the cash, back to back, like we used to\n\nWish I could lose myself in you like I used to\n\nWish I could love you\n\n\n\nLike I used to do\n\nLike I used to do\n\n\n\nWish I could lose myself in you\n\nLike I used to\n\nLike I used to do"
