You feel it? You feel it?\n\n\n\nAlone at the top of the world\n\nI forgot it was safe down below\n\nI used to be so afraid\n\nNow the darkness it swallows me whole\n\nAlone at the top of the world\n\nCut the cord let me float far away\n\nI never asked you for this\n\nSo don't tell me that I'm to blame\n\n\n\nHold your breath\n\nChoke on my words\n\nHold your breath\n\nChoke on my words\n\n\n\nDon't get me started (Hold your breath)\n\nI'm not your pawn anymore (Choke on my words)\n\nI've come all this way alone (Hold your breath)\n\nI'm on my own\n\n\n\nAlone at the top of the world\n\nI forgot it was safe down below\n\nI used to be so afraid\n\nNow the darkness it swallows me whole\n\nAlone at the top of the world\n\nCut the cord let me float far away\n\nI never asked you for this\n\nSo don't tell me that I'm to blame"
