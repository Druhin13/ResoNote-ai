Not you\n\nWho makes your beats? Not you\n\nWho does your hooks? Not you\n\nBitch I'm elite, top 2\n\nAnd not 2, bitch I'm the 1\n\nIt's crazy to think that I barely begun\n\nAlready on Forbes, Already in Staples\n\nI still got 4 years 'til my twenties are done\n\nI'm having my fun\n\nMy house is a brothel, I'm fucking her bad 'cause her pussy is gospel\n\nYour life is awful, that ain't my fault\n\nYell at your mirror, go talk to your god\n\nI'm not letting up\n\nFuck how you feel\n\nI got my boots laced and I'm out\n\nI threw 20k in my studio; I brought the blue flame to my house\n\n\n\nI ain't goin' back, ah (I ain't goin' back)\n\nSplittin' five on McDoubles\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nTo when there was no Russ, just Russell\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nTo when mom cried so much, it left a puddle\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nBut I stay tapped in to that hustle\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nSplittin' five on McDoubles\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nTo when there was no Russ, just Russell\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nTo when mom cried so much, it left a puddle\n\nI ain't goin' back (I ain't goin' back)\n\nBut I stay tapped in to that hustle (Yeah)"
