  "lyrics": "I'd sit in my bedroom strumming daddy's LG guitar,\r\nStaring out the window at all those country stars.\r\nSomehow that led me to a loaded down GMC,\r\nOil checked and all gassed up, headed for Tennessee.\r\nNo I never could have done it on my own,\n\nCountry music made me do it\n\nHeld my hand and walked me through it\n\nLead the way and kept me strong\n\nIt always does when I turn it on\n\nThere's always a high Lonesome song that keeps on pushing me along\n\nI could take the credit but I always knew it\n\ncountry music made me do it\n\n\n\nI fell for a boy he talk to real good game\n\nHe was marbro Reds living on the edge and sweet when he said my name.\n\nWell you live and learn yeah heartbreak hurts\n\nAnd it was time for me to leave\n\nWell it was hard to find my way out\n\nI was in so deep. Yea but,\n\n\n\nCountry music made me do it\n\nHeld my hand and walked me through it\n\nLead the way and kept me strong\n\nIt always does when I turn it on\n\nThere's always a high lonesome song that keeps on pushing me along\n\nI could take the credit but I always knew it\n\nCountry music made me do it\n\n\n\nI couldn't have said goodbye\n\nI never would've chased this dream\n\nI've never left it and it's never left me\n\n\n\nCountry music made me do it\n\nHeld my hand and walked me through it\n\nLead the way and kept me strong\n\nIt always does when I turn it on\n\nThere's always a high lonesome song that keeps pushing me along\n\nI could take the credit but I always knew it\n\nCountry music made me do it\n\n\n\nCountry music made do it\n\n\n\nMade me do it"
