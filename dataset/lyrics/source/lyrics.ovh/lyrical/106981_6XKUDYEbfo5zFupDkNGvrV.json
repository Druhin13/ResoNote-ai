Aye\n\nThey don't need to know, yuh (Die)\n\nSlipping isn't something that I like\n\nBut I be sliding like I'm skating when I rhyme, oh yah, oh yah\n\nCreeping like a villain in the night\n\nI got to keep myself together this time, oh yah, oh yah\n\nPedal to the meddle when I drive\n\nWrestling with The Devil all the time, oh yah, oh yah\n\nJumping up a level at a time (Aye)\n\nScar sound-waves can't die, oh yah, oh yah (Die)\n\n\n\nIs it in your head like it is in mine?\n\nAll the hurt you shed, it won't save your life\n\nThey still want you dead, better take your time\n\nWatching what you spend to control your mind\n\nT-T-This is real salvation in the flesh\n\nI-I-I do not care what they're thinking anyway\n\n\n\nThese acts of mine, these facts I stay with\n\nThese hands of God, these hands I came with\n\nI let them go, these days I regret\n\nThese doubtful flaws, I've got no patience\n\n\n\nIs it in your head like it is in mine?\n\nAll the hurt you shed, it won't save your life (Aye, aye)\n\nThey still want you dead, better take your time\n\nWatching what you spend to control your mind"
