  "lyrics": "I've ran away from love\r\nIt's gettin' hard for me to breathe\r\n'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me\r\nI tell him, \"Keep it quiet\"\r\nSo all he does is speak\r\n'Cause he wants to keep his distance\n\nBut it's hard for him to leave\n\nHe knows I hear him cryin'\n\nCryin' out for help\n\nI don't know how to save him\n\nI can't even save myself\n\nThere's many people dyin'\n\nI've always been afraid\n\nNot that I'm scared of livin'\n\nI'm scared of feeling pain\n\n\n\nI don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions\n\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\nNow, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm\n\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\n\n\nI've been so used to winnin'\n\nIt was hard for me to lose\n\nNo, there's nothing wrong with me\n\nThere's just something wrong with you\n\nSo I've been making changes\n\nBeen workin' on my health\n\nNo more competition\n\nCan't compete against myself, no, no, no\n\nI'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no\n\nI've been doin' this to be remembered\n\nLet the people hear it if they want to\n\nAll the one's around me get it on, too\n\nIf I die tomorrow and I'm gone\n\nLet the blood run high\n\nLet the carpets drown\n\nI'll be forever numb\n\n\n\nI don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions\n\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\nNow, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm\n\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\nI don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions\n\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\nNow, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm\n\nAlways had a little trouble with self-reflections\n\n\n\nLet this be a promise\n\nThat when it's said and done\n\nBe a flower in the garden\n\nBe born with the sun\n\nBe born with the sun\n\nBe born with the sun\n\nBe born with the sun\n\nBe born with the sun"
