  "lyrics": "Finally at the beach\r\nNo time to waste on PCA\r\n[?]\r\nTaught me how to stay\r\nStraight inside the sea\r\nCan't hide from all the fakes, I swear\n\nI'd rather be asleep\n\nWith the stars that lay on me\n\n\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay?\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay?\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay\n\n\n\nAnd all the problems in my head\n\nAre swimming in the open, yeah\n\nGot a rifle in my head\n\nI'm yelling at the ocean, yeah\n\nAnd all the problems in my head\n\nAre swimming in the open, yeah\n\nSo grab a bible, I'm suicidal\n\nI'm gonna rest up in a coffin, yeah\n\n\n\nSkeletons are inside of my bed\n\nAll the loneliness has got me on the edge\n\nSaying \"you are not my man\" is what she said\n\nThat's what she said\n\n\n\nSo I pull up then slide out\n\nGot me feeling like a night owl\n\nBaby bend it, twist it\n\nAre you feeling it? 'Cause I feel it now\n\n\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay?\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay?\n\nIt's okay to be okay, okay\n\n\n\nAnd all the problems in my head\n\nAre swimming in the open, yeah\n\nGot a rifle in my head\n\nI'm yelling at the ocean, yeah\n\nAnd all the problems in my head\n\nAre swimming in the open, yeah\n\nSo grab a bible, I'm suicidal\n\nI'm gonna rest up in a coffin, yeah\n\n\n\nFires burning, my soul still searching\n\nFor something bright and\n\nSomething worthless\n\nI bow my head down\n\nStill far from perfect\n\nI'm on my knees\n\nI beg for mercy\n\nMy sea\n\n\n\nI'm no longer suicidal"
