  "lyrics": "By the time you hear this, I'll be in the rearview mirror\r\nI'll even wear that green dress you like so when I disappear\r\nYou can turn around, one last look at the girl you lost in time\r\nYour turn to make up your mind between the two roads\r\nGo and take some more time, but me and mine must go\n\nI tried to wait it out, no more\n\nCan't find the man I was waiting for\n\n\n\nI wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt\n\nOver coffee, stirring in the cinnamon\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\nI wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin\n\nStirring in the cinnamon\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\n(While you read me poetry by dead men)\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\n\n\nBy the time you hear this, who knows where I might be\n\nSinging about another near-miss love that ended incomplete\n\nI tried to wait it out, no more\n\nCan't find the man I was waiting for\n\nI wanted to tell you things\n\nAll the secrets I've been keeping\n\nIt's all right in front of me, but then you just kept disappearing\n\n\n\nA good dream, almost\n\nNow I tell your ghost\n\n\n\nI wanted to be your girl in a white T-shirt\n\nOver coffee, stirring in the cinnamon\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\nI wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin\n\nStirring in the cinnamon\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\n(While you read me poetry by dead men)\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\n\n\nLine after line, the words just live to remind\n\nThe two of us, what we could have been\n\nPoetry by dead men\n\nFire from ember, how could I make you remember?\n\nWith a turn of a phrase, would you turn to me if I say\n\nI still want to be your girl?\n\n\n\nI still want to be your girl in a white T-shirt\n\nOver coffee, stirring in the cinnamon\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\nI wanted to be your girl with your hands on my skin\n\nStirring in the cinnamon\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men\n\n(While you read me poetry by dead men)\n\nWhile you read me poetry by dead men"
