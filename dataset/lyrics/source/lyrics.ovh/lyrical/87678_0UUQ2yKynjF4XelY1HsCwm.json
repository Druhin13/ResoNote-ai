  "lyrics": "Boss, dat bird mean trouble.\nOnce de buzzard fold his wing an' light over yo' house,\nAll yo' happiness done dead.\nBuzzard keep on flyin' over, take along yo' shadow.\n\nAin' nobody dead dis mornin'\n\nLivin's jus' begun.\n\nTwo is strong where one is feeble;\n\nMan an' woman livin', workin',\n\n\n\nSharin' grief an' sharin' laughter,\n\nAn' love like Augus' sun.\n\nTrouble, is dat you over yonder\n\nLookin' lean an' hungry?\n\n\n\nDon' you let dat buzzard keep you\n\nHangin' round my do'.\n\nAin' you heard de news this mornin'?\n\nStep out, brudder, hit de gravel;\n\n\n\nPorgy who you used to feed on,\n\nDon' live here no mo'\n\nHa, ha, ha, ha! Buzzard, on yo' way!\n\nOle age, what is you anyhow,\n\n\n\nNuttin' but bein' lonely.\n\nPack yo' things an' fly from here,\n\nCarry grief an' pain.\n\nDere's two folks livin' in dis shelter\n\n\n\nEatin', sleepin', singin', prayin'.\n\nAin' no such thing as loneliness.\n\nAn' Porgy's young again.\n\n\n\nBuzzard, keep on flyin',\n\nPorgy's young again."
