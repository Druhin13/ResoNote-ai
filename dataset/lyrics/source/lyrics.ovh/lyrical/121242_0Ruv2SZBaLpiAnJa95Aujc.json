  "lyrics": "There's a light on your skin\r\nPainted gold like your feet\r\nIf you're gonna lean into me\r\nMake sure you feel the heat\r\nYou can take what you want\r\nBut when you take it from me\n\nI'll make sure that you fall apart\n\nAnd fall down to your knees\n\n\n\nAnd I'm betting on a miracle to give me peace\n\nI'm not asking for a miracle, just you and me\n\n\n\nYeah, I wanna know if you're gonna be there\n\n'Cause it's hard to believe or see it\n\nWhy do I get the feeling we're getting close?\n\nBut we'll never be there\n\n'Cause it's hard to believe or see it\n\nIs it more than a feeling?\n\n\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know\n\nIf you're gonna be there\n\n'Cause it's hard to believe or see it\n\nWhy do I get the feeling?\n\nI wanna know\n\n\n\n'Cause it's never a no\n\nSo what hand will you play\n\nIs it too much to ask if I should go, or I should stay?\n\nIn a moment of doubt, put your hand on the flame\n\nWhen you need to remind yourself that you could feel the same\n\n\n\nAnd I'm betting on a miracle to give me peace\n\nI'm not asking for a miracle, just you and me\n\n\n\nYeah, I wanna know if you're gonna be there\n\n'Cause it's hard to believe or see it\n\nWhy do I get the feeling we're getting close?\n\nBut we'll never be there\n\n'Cause it's hard to believe or see it\n\nIs it more than a feeling?\n\n\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know\n\nIf you're gonna be there (You're gonna be there)\n\n'Cause it's hard to believe or see it\n\nWhy do I get the feeling?\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know, I wanna know\n\nI wanna know, I wanna know"
