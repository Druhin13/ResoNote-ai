  "lyrics": "I took the truck up to Boston\r\nDon't make it up there too often\r\nHigh beams on, it's starts to pour\r\nRadio loud, I84\r\nGot the crew back together\r\nIt feels like it's been forever\n\nBut after a drink, they left the bar\n\nWhat'd you expect? They know how we are\n\n\n\n'Cause I know it goes bad to worse, you're sad at first\n\nIt's hopeless, we can't lift that curse\n\n'Cause we both know we ain't go self-control\n\nAnd I'll always come when you bang on my door\n\n\n\nSo I stayed overnight\n\nBut I got going at first light\n\nI left a note: Happy New Year\n\nUnder an empty bottle of beer\n\nAnd drove straight back to work\n\nMy head still throbbing, my throat sore\n\nBut I got home and opened the door\n\nI wasn't surprised to see you back on the floor\n\n\n\n'Cause I know it goes bad to worse, you're sad at first\n\nIt's hopeless, we can't lift that curse\n\n'Cause we both know we ain't go self-control\n\nAnd I'll always come when you bang on my door\n\n\n\nGoes too long, wake up on the floor\n\nDon't think I need to make this trip anymore\n\n'Cause of me knows it's gonna get dark\n\nBut when you come around, I fall apart\n\n'Cause I know it goesâ€”\n\n\n\nBad to worse, you're sad at first\n\nIt's hopeless, we can't lift that curse\n\n'Cause we both know we ain't go self-control\n\nAnd I'll always come when you bang on my door\n\nIt goes bad to worse, you're sad at first\n\nIt's hopeless, we can't lift that curse\n\n'Cause we both know we ain't go self-control\n\nAnd I'll always come when you bang on my door"
