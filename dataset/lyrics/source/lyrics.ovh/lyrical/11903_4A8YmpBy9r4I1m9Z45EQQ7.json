  "lyrics": "Hey, they said it didn't recede so it all points back to you\r\nThey reckon you had them, all points back to you\r\nEveryone I ask is the same so there's only one conclusion\r\nLook at it from my point of view then there's really no confusion\r\nAll, all points back to you\n\nIt all points back to you\n\nI ain't pointing fingers but it all points back to you\n\nIt all points back to you\n\n\n\nI have nothing to say, it all comes back to you\n\nOk, have it your way, it all points back to you\n\n'Cause I ain't really messing so you better start letting loose\n\nTrust me, I ain't really stressing, 'cause I already have the truth\n\n\n\nIt all points back to you\n\nIt all points back to you\n\nI ain't pointing fingers but it all points back to you\n\nIt all points back to you\n\n\n\nWhat you gonna do?\n\nWhat you gonna say?\n\nHow you gonna make it right?\n\nWhat you gonna do?\n\nWhat you gonna say?\n\nHow you gonna stop the fight?\n\nAh, but you did it, drew the points back to you\n\nYou did it, you did it, it all points back to you\n\nYou did it, you did it, you did it\n\nYou did it, you did it, you did it"
