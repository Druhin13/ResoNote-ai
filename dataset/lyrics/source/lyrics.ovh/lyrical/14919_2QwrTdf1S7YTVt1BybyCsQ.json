  "lyrics": "You can lie awake at night\r\nPretend not to see\r\nBut you can't put that apple\r\nBack up on its tree\r\nThere ain't no worries\r\nYou can't drink away\n\nI trust you to dig my grave\n\n\n\nWoke up this morning\n\nPoured a cup of the blues\n\nI will always find a way to lose\n\nGive me one reason\n\nA reason I should stay\n\nI trust you to dig my grave\n\n\n\nSpend your whole life with one woman\n\nDie and leave her your farm\n\nThe very next day she's on your best friend's arm\n\nThere ain't no worries\n\nYou can't drink away\n\nI trust you to dig my grave\n\n\n\nI walk but I stumble\n\nI roll but I tumble\n\nI reach but I fumble\n\nI speak but I mumble\n\nComin' and goin'\n\nA hundred different ways\n\nI trust you to dig my grave\n\n\n\nDon't want to be your first lover\n\nI just want to be your last\n\nIf you promise not to tell\n\nI promise not to ask\n\nThere ain't no worries\n\nYou can't drink away\n\nI trust you to dig my grave"
