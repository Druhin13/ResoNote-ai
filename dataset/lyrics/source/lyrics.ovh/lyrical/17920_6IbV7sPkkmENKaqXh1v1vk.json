  "lyrics": "I did what I do best\r\nForgot myself\r\nGot overdressed like everybody else\r\nA glance and a half smile\r\nBlack heels on the white tile\r\nIt took seven years for your path to realign\n\nBut I'll still think of you\n\nOn the fifth of June\n\nCause when I saw you I lost you all over again\n\n\n\nGone\n\n\n\nDoesn't it feel good to be invisible\n\nJust like the way I used to be\n\nHave I been fading away?\n\nYeah I'm so gone\n\n\n\nAnd I can feel your stare like dynamite\n\nBreaking silence with Irish goodbyes\n\nBut I'm not who you remember\n\nJust who do you remember?\n\nSince you stole it all away\n\nYou stole it all away\n\n\n\nYou need a change of pace without my ghost\n\nBut you're better off when I go\n\nA painful anecdote sure to stunt your growth\n\nYou're better off when I'm gone\n\n\n\nShapeshifter\n\nThere's no way back\n\nShapeshifter you're never gonna get the girl\n\nThere's no way back\n\nShapeshifter you're never gonna change the world\n\nThere's no way back"
