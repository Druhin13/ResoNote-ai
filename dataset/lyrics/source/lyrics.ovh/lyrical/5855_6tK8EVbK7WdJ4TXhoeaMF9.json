  "lyrics": "In my body I have a master\r\nI bow down when she comes around\r\nIn my body I’m a disaster\r\nI break down when you shake the ground\r\nEvery time I stand to leave my cage\n\nIn my broken body I stay\n\n\n\nI want to love like a man\n\nI’ll build you a home when I can\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nPatient now it’s all that I have\n\nI fought the world for your hand\n\nI fought the world for your hand\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nIt’s all I have\n\n\n\nIn my body I fight fire\n\nWith the snow, my hell is cold\n\nIn my body I have a soft light\n\nBurning low, but too hot to hold\n\nI’ve become the only thing I hate\n\nLeave this broken body today\n\n\n\nI want to love like a man\n\nI’ll build you a home when I can\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nPatient now it’s all that I have\n\nI fought the world for your hand\n\nI fought the world for your hand\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nIt’s all I have\n\n\n\nI was hearing words in black and white\n\nTwisted up inside my broken mind\n\nOutstretched dirty hands just like a child\n\nHungry little fool, but you were mine\n\nYou’re all I have\n\nYou’re all I have\n\n\n\nGive my new body a chance\n\nGive my new body a chance"
