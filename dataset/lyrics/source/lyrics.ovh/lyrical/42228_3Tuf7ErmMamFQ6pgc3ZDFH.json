  "lyrics": "The main door was left wide-open, but I took the other\r\nThere were shouts and screams and meanwhile I was arbitrator\r\nSat myself in between he and his replacement mother\r\nHe seemed to be so briefly my good French brother\r\nBut the friendship is no longer on\r\nJean is goin', goin', gone\n\n\n\nHe said he'd leave, he leaves me no other option\n\nBut to put my loyalties up for adoption\n\nAnd it seems to be to me that weed leaves lie forgotten\n\nAnd we used to smoke those leaves, oh so very often\n\nOften and for very long\n\nSo Jean is goin', goin', gone\n\n\n\nHe'd say he knows his nose could smell that I was smitten\n\nWith that girl from across the road, did you see I was love-bitten?\n\nHe'd tell me that he had my back and then my spine would stiffen\n\nBut I cursed when I learned his word weren't really worth a pittance\n\nBoth of them had lead me on\n\nOh Jean is goin', goin', gone\n\n\n\nI could see in his eyes that I weren't really much motivation\n\nTo inspire him to be kind, I took him in to a [?]\n\nThese lies no crimes of mine, my truths are on rotation\n\nTo be wise I knew he'd provide all the right quotations\n\nBut his wisdom, it was just a con\n\nSo Jean is goin', goin', gone\n\nSo Jean is goin', goin', gone"
