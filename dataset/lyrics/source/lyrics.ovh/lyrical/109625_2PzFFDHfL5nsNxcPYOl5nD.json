  "lyrics": "God, I feel like hell tonight\r\nTears of rage I cannot fight\r\nI'd be the last to help you understand\r\nAre you strong enough to be my man?\r\nNothing's true and nothing's right\r\nSo let me be alone tonight\n\nCause you can't change the way I am\n\nAre you strong enough to be my man?\n\n\n\nLie to me\n\nI promise I'll believe\n\nLie to me\n\nBut please don't leave\n\n\n\nI have a face I cannot show\n\nI make the rules up as I go\n\nIt's try and love me if you can\n\nAre you strong enough to be my man?\n\n\n\nWhen I've shown you that I just don't care\n\nWhen I'm throwing punches in the air\n\nWhen I'm broken down and I can't stand\n\nWill you be strong enough to be my man?\n\n\n\nLie to me\n\nI promise I'll believe\n\nLie to me\n\nBut please don't leave"
