  "lyrics": "Believe me,\r\nI'm someone who believes in you\r\nSay you really had a million dollars\r\nAnd a car for ev'ry day of the week\r\nSo what? You know what?\r\nIt wouldn't mean not a single thing\n\nWithout that someone who believes it too\n\nYeah, you gotta have someone\n\nWho believes in you\n\n\n\nSay you really had a Hollywood contract\n\nAnd your face upon a big billboard\n\nBig car, big star\n\nYou'd move a lot\n\nBut you wouldn't get far without\n\nThat someone who believes it too\n\nYou better have someone\n\nWho believes in you\n\n\n\nYou are the truest part of me\n\nThat quiet place\n\nWhere I can be strong\n\nYou come to fill my deepest need\n\nYou call my name and I hear your song\n\n\n\nBelieve me,\n\nThere's someone who believes in you\n\n\n\nSo you really got the hots for stardom\n\nAll you need is some big guitar\n\nTo take you and make you\n\nInto an overnight star\n\nAnd then you'll find\n\nThat stars get lonesome too\n\nAnd you better have someone\n\nWho believes in you\n\n\n\nYou are the truest part of me\n\nThat tender place\n\nWhere I can be strong\n\nYou come to fill my deepest need\n\nYou speak my name\n\nAnd I hear your song\n\n\n\nSo you really want a job in the circus\n\nPaint your face and make the people smile\n\nHey clown, come on down\n\nYou've been too long walkin' that high wire\n\nWhen you're falling, you'll be calling too\n\nCalling out to someone\n\nWho believes in you\n\nSomeone\n\nWho's there when nobody needs you\n\nCallin' out to someone\n\nWho believes in you"
