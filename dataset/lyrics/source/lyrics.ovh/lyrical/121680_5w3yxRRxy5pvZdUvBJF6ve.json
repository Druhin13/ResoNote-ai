  "lyrics": "I want to stay South of the River\r\nWith the chains and the gold\r\nWe could be out here together;\r\nBut, you have places to go\r\nWatching the sunshine blaze the gray\n\nI don't know why you wouldn't stay\n\nYou should come South of the River\n\nWhere the loving is gold\n\n\n\nYou should come South of the River\n\nThis is where it all starts\n\nI think that we could stay here forever\n\nLie on the roof til' it's dark\n\n\n\nAnd when the last bus pulls away\n\nI swear that I almost heard you say\n\n\"I should move South of the River.\"\n\nI want to get to know\n\nI want to get to know, oh\n\n\n\nI want to stay South of the River"
