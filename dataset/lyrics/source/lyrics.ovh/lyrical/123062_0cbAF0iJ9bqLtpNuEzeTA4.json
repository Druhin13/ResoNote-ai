  "lyrics": "What a feeling when I feel a feel for real\r\nI'm overwoke and flippin' a table\r\nI shed a tear and then appear in the mirror\r\nStill hear but blasted out through pineal cable\n\nSand trap, the only path is still under construction\n\nSame vein but different textures\n\nAn infinite selection\n\n\n\nI'm finna whip my hip out my frame\n\nTwist bone that hooks through the brain\n\nLoops lonely needs a twin action\n\nFast enough to flip the attraction\n\n\n\nI hide away\n\nPacing back and forth\n\nSome vanity is what I need\n\nBut I'm stuck slouching\n\n\n\nI lie awake\n\nWhen all my dreams fall short\n\nOf everything that I could be\n\nIf I stopped slouching\n\n\n\nCome back to my range\n\nIf you can't hang you know I won't change\n\n\n\nShe'd be a model if you gave her some time\n\nShe'll spin the bottle if you give her a sign\n\n\n\nI can see it and it's audibly wobbly\n\nTastes just like a can of broccoli\n\nFishing hook like slimy apostrophe\n\nOne letter missing 'tween two monstrosities\n\n\n\nI'm finna whip my hip out my frame\n\nTwist bone that hooks through the brain\n\nLoops lonely needs a twin action\n\nFast enough to flip the attraction\n\n\n\nI hide away\n\nPacing back and forth\n\nSome vanity is what I need\n\nBut I'm stuck slouching\n\n\n\nI lie awake\n\nWhen all my dreams fall short\n\nOf everything that I could be\n\nIf I stopped slouching\n\n\n\nOh...Blast!\n\n\n\nCut after cut of liquid energy\n\nBeams are buffed and I'm like \"yay\"\n\nBack in the beast, hate this impulse slave\n\nClose it up then ride the wave\n\n\n\nI just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow\n\nSnake round the wheel, now I know what I known\n\nI just wanted to be the slick glaive robed in glow\n\nAll wrapped up and raving and rolled through the snow, go\n\n\n\nGo\n\nGo\n\nGo\n\nGo\n\nGo, go, go, go\n\nGo, go, go, go, go, go, go, go"
