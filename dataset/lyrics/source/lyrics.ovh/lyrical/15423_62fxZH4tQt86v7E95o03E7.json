  "lyrics": "When you're at the end of the road\r\nAnd it's not the one that you would have chosen\r\nWhen you're at the end of your rope\r\nAnd you're holding on, but feel like you're falling\r\nWith every option exhausted\n\nYou've tried everything you know\n\nYou saw a light then you lost it\n\nBut there is still hope\n\n\n\nLike the fire in the night\n\nLike the ocean parted wide\n\nLike the grave, empty inside\n\nYou will see He still does\n\nMiracles, miracles, miracles, miracles\n\n\n\nEven if you don't see it now\n\nWithout a doubt, He's already moving\n\nThere is not a pain that you hold\n\nHe doesn't know, and He isn't using\n\n\n\nWith every option exhausted\n\nYou've tried everything you know\n\nSo reach for something beyond it\n\n'Cause He is our hope\n\n\n\nLike the fire in the night\n\nLike the ocean parted wide\n\nLike the grave, empty inside\n\nYou will see He still does\n\nMiracles, miracles, miracles, miracles\n\nMiracles, miracles, miracles, miracles\n\n\n\nA broken heart can be restored\n\nA broken soul can be reborn\n\nAnd greater things are still in store\n\nFor us, for us\n\n\n\nLike the fire in the night\n\nLike the ocean parted wide\n\nLike the grave empty inside\n\nYou will see He still does\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\n(He still does, He still does)\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\n(More than you can dare to dream)\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\n(More than you have ever seen)\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\n(There's still more, there's still more)\n\nMiracles, miracles\n\n(Miracles)\n\n\n\n(Miracles, miracles)"
