  "lyrics": "I sucked another dick last night\r\nNot sayin' that's wrong or right\r\nFirst few that I blew\r\nI could blame on the booze\r\nBut now it's just something I do\r\nWe didn't fuck, so don't get uptight\n\nBut I sucked another dick last night\n\n\n\nNow Darling, don't get me wrong\n\nIt'd be you if you had a dong\n\nPlease don't tell our son 'cause he won't understand\n\nThis cock-gobblin', cuw-swallerin', crazy old man\n\nPlease accept me for the guy that I am\n\nAnd not what I'd do in the back of the van\n\n\n\nI sucked another dick last night\n\nNot sayin' that's wrong or right\n\nFirst few that I blew\n\nI could blame on the booze\n\nBut now it's just something I do\n\nWe didn't fuck, so don't get uptight\n\nBut I sucked another dick last night\n\n\n\nDarling, stop yelling, the baby's asleep\n\nDidn't kiss neither of you until I brushed my teeth\n\nSo I need you to stop all this judging of me\n\nThe good Lord made all of us differently\n\n\n\nI sucked another dick last night\n\nNot sayin' that's wrong or right\n\nFirst few that I blew\n\nI could blame on the booze\n\nBut now it's just something I do\n\nWe didn't fuck, so don't get uptight\n\n\n\nOnce-a-month at the most, not all the time\n\nYou have to trust it'll all be alright\n\nBut I sucked another dick last night"
