  "lyrics": "Drama in my life on purpose\r\n'Cause I don’t need to have purpose\r\nThrow it all away to make ends\r\nFucking up my night to keep friends\r\nYou look hella broke in the comments\r\nSo I don't need to have comments on how you feel\n\n\n\nI did it all for the no\n\nI did it all for the no good reasons\n\nI said it all for the need\n\nI always knew you would change like seasons\n\n\n\nOh, got a canary on the roadside\n\nHaters would say that they can't find me\n\nToo many people in my rider\n\nI take another pill and I’m on a\n\nHeight as a blimp in the projects\n\nI don't need to be modest in how I feel, oh\n\n\n\nI ain't never broke but if I'm broke, don't fix me\n\n'Cause I don't need a halfway entry\n\nI'm going solo and I’m moving slowly\n\nAll I care is how I feel\n\nI can’t wait to be honest\n\nIn what's real\n\n\n\nI did it all for the no\n\nBroke it all for the no good reasons\n\nI said it all for the no\n\nDid it all for the need\n\nI did it all for the no\n\nSaid it all for the need, yeah\n\nI broke it all for the no\n\nI did it all for the need, yeah\n\n\n\nI did it all for the no\n\nI said it all for the need"
