  "lyrics": "It's gonna be a long one, another grave yard shift\r\nAs he says goodbye to his wife and kids\r\nHe spends his life just like his dad's\r\nDriving away under the weight of the badge\r\nHe's seen it all in his fifteen years\n\nWatchin' our backs, facing our fears\n\nLord knows it ain't no easy task\n\nKeeping us safe under the weight of the badge\n\n\n\nHe swore that oath to protect and serve\n\nPours his heart and soul into both those words\n\nLays his life on the line\n\nAnd the line he walks is razor-fine\n\nTempered strength is always tough\n\nBut he ain't gonna buckle under the weight of the badge\n\n\n\nNot that long ago, he woke up in the hospital\n\nWith his wife and kids praying by his bed\n\nHe said, \"I'm gonna be alright\n\nThere's just some times you gotta fight\"\n\nAnd the truth is, nothing truer could be said\n\nI do it for us and I do it for them\n\nAnd I ain't gonna buckle under the weight of the badge\n\n\n\nIt doesn't weigh a lot until you put it on\n\nAnd the weight of it is staggering\n\nThen duty calls each time\n\nHe knows he's gotta answer\n\nAnd it's all in the hand of\n\nThe heavy weight of the badge\n\nAnd he ain't gonna buckle\n\nUnder the weight of the badge\n\nNo, he ain't gonna buckle\n\nUnder the weight of the badge"
