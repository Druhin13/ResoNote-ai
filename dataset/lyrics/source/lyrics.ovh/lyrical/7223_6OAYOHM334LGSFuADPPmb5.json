  "lyrics": "I know you know I know that there's something that's worth holding on to\r\nIn spite of the burned out scene and the aging pains and the quiet little monsters\r\nAnd you know I know you know that I feel the same, I feel just like you do\r\nWhen I hear you say sometimes there's something pure about growing up lonesome\r\nAll my life I was the quiet kind\n\nI just kept to myself and my dreaming\n\nAnd all my life I just tried to survive\n\nI'm not trying to shut you out\n\n\n\nAnd she says, \"I just wanna live, and if I get the chance then I would wanna live again,\"\n\nBut I get this nightmare where you leave me on my own\n\nAll I want is to let you know but my words get lost and haunt the back of my throat\n\nAnd little nightmares, keep telling me you'll go\n\nKeep telling me you'll go\n\n\n\nI see you shake and shake and shake and shake and I wanna reach out now\n\nBecause there must be a brighter light there's a simple life that gets past these breakdowns\n\nAnd you know that I know you know that I crash the same in tiny little pieces\n\nYou gotta know that I'm on your side and there's something gold about someone you can bleed on\n\n\n\nAll my life I was the killing kind\n\nI was cool as the cold stormy weather\n\nAll my life I just tried to survive\n\nI'm not trying to shut you out\n\n\n\nAnd she says, \"I just wanna live, and if I get the chance then I would wanna live again,\"\n\nBut I get this nightmare where you leave me on my own\n\nAll I want is to let you know but my words get lost and haunt the back of my throat\n\nAnd little nightmares, keep telling me you'll go\n\nKeep telling me you'll go\n\n\n\nDon't you know there's an ocean of hope underneath the grey sky where you're dreaming?\n\nAnd it's so hard to know which lonely hand you should hold\n\nYou can hold me until you don't want me\n\nWe can cry together through the bad dreams\n\nWe can cry together through the bad dreams \n\nWe can cry together through the bad dreams \n\nWe can cry together through the bad dreams \n\nThrough the nightmare that is the waiting and...\n\n\n\nAnd she says, \"I just wanna live, and if I get the chance then I would wanna live again,\"\n\nBut I get this nightmare where you leave me on my own\n\nAnd all I want is to let you know but my words get lost and haunt the back of my throat\n\nWild horses couldn't drag me away (from you baby)\n\nAnd she says, \"I just wanna live, and if we get the chance I would wanna live again,\"\n\nBut I get this nightmare where you leave me on my own\n\nWhere you leave me on my own"
