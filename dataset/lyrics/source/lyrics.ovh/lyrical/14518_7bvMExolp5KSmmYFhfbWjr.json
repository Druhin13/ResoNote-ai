  "lyrics": "For all your ruminations on strength and purpose\r\nThere's only dust collecting\r\nIn a mind where none can find you\r\nYou've shown a wealth of disease\r\nA hand that's broken in fractions\n\nA face that's masked in decay\n\nWith no body to call his own now\n\nHe's turning inward\n\n\n\nI, I've lost faith\n\nThere's only ugliness here\n\nOnly death can find me\n\nSo we know that nothing's true\n\n\n\nIn all your life there's deception\n\nThat somewhere truth can be found\n\nIn a house where faith has failed you\n\nThere is no use in defending\n\n\n\nA hand that's broken in fractions\n\nA face that's masked in decay\n\nWith no body to call his own now\n\nHe's turning inward\n\n\n\nI, I've lost faith\n\nThere's only ugliness here\n\nOnly death can find me\n\nSo we know that nothing's true\n\nWe knew another way\n\nTo live beyond our despair\n\nYou're gone, we're here\n\nSo we know that death is real\n\n\n\nAnd we know that death is real\n\n\n\nThoughts of delusion behind stagnant cold eyes\n\nFaces masked inside a house decayed and twisting\n\nAll around me are the plastic holy relics\n\nThey remind me of my vibrance, gone\n\n\n\nOnly death can find me"
