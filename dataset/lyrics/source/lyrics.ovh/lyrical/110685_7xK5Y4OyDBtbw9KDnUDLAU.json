  "lyrics": "You left without a clue\r\nAnd now I'm stuck here picking up the pieces\r\nBlindsided by the truth\r\nI couldn't see because you were my weakness\r\nMy honest heart in the palm of your hand\n\nYou crushed it. Oh you crushed it\n\nI gave you all that I had. All I am\n\nWas it nothin'? Was it nothing'?\n\n\n\nI thought I'd come back to find that you'd been waiting\n\nBut I was wrong and you moved on. What are you chasing?\n\nI'm such a fool\n\n\n\nNow you're just a ghost\n\nHaunting all the space around me\n\nThe thought of letting go\n\nIt pulls me under I think I'm drowning\n\n\n\nMy honest heart, all I had, all I am\n\nYeah you crushed it. Was I nothing?\n\n\n\nI thought I'd come back to find that you'd been waiting\n\nBut I was wrong and you moved on. What are you chasing?\n\nI hope you find what you're looking for, for me it was always you\n\nYeah I thought I'd come back to find that you'd been waiting\n\nI'm such a fool\n\n\n\nI never thought that you'd be capable to something like this!\n\n\n\nMy honest heart in the palm of your hand, you crushed it\n\nI gave you all that I had. All I am, was it nothin'?\n\nWas I nothing'?\n\n\n\nI thought I'd come back to find that you'd been waiting\n\nBut I was wrong and you moved on. What are you chasing?\n\nI hope you find what you're looking for, for me it was always you\n\nYeah I thought I'd come back to find that you'd been waiting\n\nI'm such a fool\n\nI'm such a fool\n\nI'm such a fool"
