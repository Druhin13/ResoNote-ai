  "lyrics": "Hey kid I got your text\r\nUm, it's hard to keep up with you\r\nYou're probably on stage somewhere, I think Poughkeepsie\r\nBut listen, that's completely out of your control\r\nDon't stress about what you can't control\r\nYou know that everything's gonna work itself out, okay? it always does\n\nImagine if you were driving from one end of the country to the other\n\nAnd sometimes, the drive is easy\n\nAnd sometimes you're driving in the pitch black\n\nAnd you can't see in front of you\n\nBut you got headlights\n\nAnd that lights up about a hundred feet\n\nAnd you focus on that hundred feet\n\nAnd you get through it\n\nAnd then the headlights focus on another hundred feet\n\nAnd you keep going and you trust yourself\n\nAnd you're gonna get to the other end of the country, okay?\n\nGood stuff happens to good people\n\nYou just gotta be yourself, don't ever change for anyone\n\nKeep busting your ass, okay? I'm proud of you kid\n\n\"Tell him I said hi\", mama says hi, love you kid\n\nAnd also, remember what Bob Dylan says\n\nYou gotta keep swimming or you sink like a stone"
