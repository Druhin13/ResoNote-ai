  "lyrics": "I use my outside voice because I have no choice\r\nThe barn that I was raised in was constructed out of noise\r\nAnd now I’m all torn up because my buttercup\r\nUp and gone and left me\r\nSaid she finally had enough\r\nLeft me here to ruminate on all she can’t admit\n\nAnd all she can’t explain\n\n\n\nAll time what, I never thought, I never thought\n\nAll time what, things break apart, things break apart\n\n\n\nMan, she pulled out the rug from her doodlebug\n\nRolling down the highway\n\nNot a worry in her mind\n\nHere’s a flash card where someone’s written stultify\n\nI take it as a sign\n\nIt’s hard to redefine\n\nSame old sad soliloquy\n\nThey handed me a broom\n\nThe cast has left the room\n\n\n\nAll time what, stumble about wrapped in a shroud\n\nAll time what, partly submerged playing a dirge\n\n\n\nComplete completely completelier\n\nDefeat defeated defeatlier\n\nComplete completely completelier\n\nDefeat defeated defeatlier\n\n\n\nAll time what, I never thought, I never thought\n\nAll time what, things break apart, things break apart"
