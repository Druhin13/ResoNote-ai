I love you\n\n\n\nI’ve made a grave mistake\n\nTrue love miscalculated\n\nMy nightmare turns to day\n\nI can still feel you in my space\n\n\n\nWhy did you\n\nHow could you\n\nI want to\n\nWhere did we go\n\n\n\nWhere did we go? I love you\n\n\n\nKeep it all locked tight\n\nIn the middle of the night\n\nThink I’m doing this right\n\nIt wasn’t my fault\n\n\n\nI called out...\n\n\n\nThis is too much\n\nI’ve had enough\n\nI get so sick of you calling my bluff\n\nKnow that you won’t\n\nWhat if you don’t\n\nHow bout you sit back, let it play out\n\n\n\nWhere did we go? I love you"
