  "lyrics": "Hey boy you taught me my first song\r\nThe air was warm and I was young\r\nWhile Leonard Cohen sang Susanne\r\nWe kissed and kissed but then you ran\r\nThe song was Teenager in Love\r\nOh God, you couldn't make it up\n\nHey that's no way to say goodbye\n\nSo you didn't even try\n\n\n\nI wanted you, I watched you from afar\n\nAnd I thought you cool, because you played guitar\n\nBet you were cool, maybe still are\n\nThank God I could sing and I had my guitar\n\nOh I had my guitar\n\n\n\nHey boy you only used three chords and opened up the door\n\nAnd though we kissed and kissed and kissed\n\nYou were nothing but a catalyst\n\nI was taken in, I thought you were the star\n\nThank God I could sing and I had my guitar\n\nI couldn't begin, until I fell apart\n\nThank God I could sing and that was just the start\n\nI thought it was you, I was wide-eyed and marked\n\nSo heavy and new, I picked up my guitar\n\nAnd started to sing and opened up my heart\n\nIt was everything, I thank my lucky stars\n\nThank God for my guitar\n\nThank God for my guitar"
