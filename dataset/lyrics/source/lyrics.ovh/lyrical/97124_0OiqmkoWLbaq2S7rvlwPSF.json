  "lyrics": "Don’t keep on telling me that I’m gonna pull through\r\nWhen you don’t know low like I do\r\nI’m afraid of the things I don’t say\r\nThe thoughts in my head that keep me tossing, turning, lying awake\r\nDon’t keep on telling me that I’m gonna pull through\n\nWhen you don’t know low like I do\n\n\n\nI’ve been running away again\n\nI’ve been running away again\n\n\n\nI’ve been running away again\n\nChasing after all the battles I can never win\n\nI don’t think that I can take much more it\n\nIt feels like I’ve lost it all (Lost it all)\n\nWho will save me when I can’t save myself?\n\n\n\nHard to think we were born to live this way\n\nBurning bridges, ripping stitches out to drown the pain\n\nBleed me out, run me dry, watch the hammer fall\n\nLet the river run and bury me beneath it all\n\n\n\nBury me\n\nBury me beneath it all\n\n\n\nI’ve been running away again\n\nChasing after all the battles I can never win\n\nI don’t think that I can take much more it\n\nIt feels like I’ve lost it all (Lost it all)\n\nWho will save me when I can’t save myself?\n\n\n\nSearching for answers\n\nA cure for this cancer\n\nIt’s all in my head\n\nI’m one step from the edge\n\n\n\nI’ve been running away again\n\nChasing after all the battles I can never win\n\nI don’t think that I can take much more it\n\nIt feels like I’ve lost it all\n\nI’ve been running away again\n\nChasing after all the battles I can never win\n\nI don’t think that I can take much more it\n\nIt feels like I’ve lost it all (Lost it all)\n\nWho will save me when I can’t save myself?\n\n(Save myself)\n\nWho will save me when I can’t save myself?\n\n\n\nWho will save me when I can’t save myself?"
