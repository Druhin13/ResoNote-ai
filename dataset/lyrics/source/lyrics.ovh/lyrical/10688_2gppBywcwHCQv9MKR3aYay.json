You wanted an ocean\n\nYou wanted an ocean\n\n\n\nCleanse my eyes, my legs, my face, everything in between\n\nThis place was never meant for me\n\nThis place was never meant for me\n\nCleanse my eyes, my legs, my face, everything in between\n\nThis place was never meant for me\n\nThis place was never meant for me\n\n\n\nAt least that’s how it seems to be\n\nAt least that’s how it seems to be\n\nTo me\n\n\n\nClose the casket make your way to the shoreline\n\nI can taste the salt I can taste the salt\n\nI can taste the birthplace where I evolved\n\n\n\nBring me back\n\nI never wanted to leave\n\nBring me back\n\nIt's all I had\n\nBring me back\n\nAnd now I'm suffocating\n\nBring me back\n\nIs this too much to ask?\n\n\n\nWell I'm breaking through\n\nDo these walls seem thick?\n\nWell I'm breaking through\n\nWell I'm breaking through\n\nDo these walls seem thick?\n\nWell I'm breaking through\n\nBreaking through"
