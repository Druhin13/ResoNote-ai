  "lyrics": "Day dream wash away, come on back another day\r\nBeen the host of this fine wine company\r\nI'm wild in the wind and it's not quite time to come back\r\nRev rev roll away, light it up and rip away\r\nThe roller coaster of my little mystery\n\nI'm wild in the wind and it's not quite time to come back\n\n\n\nI'm twisting and turning and ripping and reeling and burning and steaming and scratching my way out...\n\nNever stop spinning the vision and sound\n\nAshes to ashes we all bow down\n\n\n\nBe my rebel, be my rebel, be my rebel in me\n\nBe my rebel, be my rebel, be my rebel in me\n\n\n\nCh... Change out the burning man\n\nbut that last ride home you can never plan\n\nRaise a glass to the Blackstar before he comes back\n\n\n\nI'm twisting and turning and ripping and reeling and burning and steaming and scratching my way out...\n\nNever stop spinning that vision and sound\n\nAshes to ashes we all bow down\n\n\n\nBe my rebel, be my rebel, be my rebel in me\n\nBe my rebel, be my rebel, be my rebel in me"
