  "lyrics": "A wild ride, over stony ground \nSuch a lust for life, the circus comes to town \nWe are the hungry ones, on a lightning raid \nJust like a river runs, like a fire needs flame \nI burn for you \n\n\nI gotta feel it in my blood whoa oh \n\nI need your touch don't need your love whoa oh \n\n\n\nAnd I want and I need \n\nAnd I lust animal \n\nAnd I want and I need \n\nAnd I lust animal \n\n\n\nCry wolf, given mouth to mouth \n\nLike a movin' heartbeat in the witching hour \n\nI'm runnin' with the wind, a shadow in the dust \n\nAnd like the drivin' rain, yeah, like the restless rust \n\nI never sleep \n\n\n\n[Repeat Bridge]\n\n\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\nHuh! \n\nAh! \n\nCry wolf, baby cry tough \n\nGonna hunt you like an, an, an, an, an, animal \n\nGonna take your love 'n' run \n\n\n\n[guitar solo] \n\n\n\n[Repeat Bridge]\n\n\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\nAnd I want and I need \n\nAnd I lust animal \n\nTake me, ame me \n\nMake me your animal \n\nShow me stroke me \n\nLet me be your animal \n\nI want, ooh yeah, animal"
