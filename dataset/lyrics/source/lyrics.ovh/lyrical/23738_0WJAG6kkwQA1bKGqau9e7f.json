  "title": "Livin' On a Memory",
  "lyrics": "The street light crawls into a bare bulb hotel\r\nWhere dead eyes shine there's a story to tell\r\nIt's a life of crime on a bed of stone\r\nWhen the devil calls you're better off alone\r\nChorus:\n\nAnd now I'm hiding from the light, running from my destiny\n\nHaunted by a flame, lying low, livin' on a memory\n\n\n\nThe bugs still bite and the breezes blow\n\nBetween your dreams right through your clothes\n\nThe days roll by like cars on a train\n\nAnd the August sky still looks like rain\n\n\n\nchorus\n\n\n\nHaunted by a dream, I can't escape this reverie\n\nTrying to break away, lying low, livin' on a memory\n\n\n\nI'll be walking behind you, I'm a face on the wind\n\nI'll be watchin', still payin' for my sins\n\n\n\nI'm drifting down the river so slow\n\nAs the lights of town are beginning to glow\n\n\n\nchorus\n\n\n\nHaunted by a dream, I can't escape from this reverie\n\nTrying to break away, lying low, livin' on a memory..."
