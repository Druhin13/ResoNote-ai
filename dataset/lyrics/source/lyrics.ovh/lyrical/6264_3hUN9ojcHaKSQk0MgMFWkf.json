  "lyrics": "Cops found him on a Sunday\r\nSo we all met up Monday night\r\nI guess we always kinda figured this might happen, someday\r\nIt's just a drag that we were right\r\nEverybody tellin' me that he's in heaven\n\n\"He's prob'ly smilin' down on us right now\"\n\nBut judgin' by the kind of stuff he was all mixed up in\n\nEven I have my doubts\n\n\n\nWe drink one for our friend Bobby\n\nRan his car right off the road\n\nOn accident? On purpose?\n\nDarlin', even now we don't know\n\nDrink one for our friend Bobby\n\nHopin' them gates'll let him in\n\nOn accident, on purpose\n\nDarlin', those were pretty much the same to him\n\n\n\nMy dad called him \"The neighbor kid\"\n\nNext best thing to next-of-kin\n\nI prob'ly would'a got beat up like a thousand more times than I did\n\nIf I didn't grow up next to him\n\n\n\nAnd now my friends can just keep in talkin'\n\nGoin' on and on about a bunch of lies\n\nWhen's the last time any of them saw him? Or even called him?\n\nHe wasn't that bad a guy\n\n\n\nI drink one for my friend Bobby\n\nRan his car right off the road\n\nOn accident? On purpose?\n\nDarlin', even now we don't know\n\nDrink one for our friend Bobby\n\nHopin' them gates'll let him in\n\nOn accident, on purpose?\n\nDarlin', those were pretty much the same to him\n\nThose were pretty much the same to him\n\nThose were pretty much the same to him"
