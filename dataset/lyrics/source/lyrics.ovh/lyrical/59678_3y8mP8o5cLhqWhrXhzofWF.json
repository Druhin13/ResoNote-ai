  "title": "I've Loved You Since Forever",
  "lyrics": "Before birds flew over rainbows\r\nAnd monkeys swung on trees\r\nThere was you, and there was me\r\nBefore the sun set in the sky\r\nAnd honey came from bees\r\nThere was you, and there was me\n\nBefore the moon lit up the night\n\nAnd elephants wandered free\n\nThere was you, and there was me\n\nBefore otters swam together\n\nAnd rivers reached the sea\n\nThere was you, and there was me\n\n\n\nWaiting for the day our paths would cross\n\nAnd you and I turned into we\n\nOh, I've loved you since forever\n\nAnd forever's how long you'll be loved by me"
