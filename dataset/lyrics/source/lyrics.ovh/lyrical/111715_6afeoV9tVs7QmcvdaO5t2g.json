  "lyrics": "Home before dark\r\nBefore the night comes falling\r\nThe sun going down\r\nAnd I can hear you calling\r\nI followed my star\r\nJust to be where you are\n\nBut I couldn't get far\n\nIn the dark\n\n\n\nHome before dark\n\nBefore the day deserts me\n\nI looked for my truth\n\nKnowing the truth might hurt me\n\nBeen traveling light\n\nJust ahead of the night\n\nTo be getting home right\n\nBefore dark\n\n\n\nI've been searching\n\nCan't explain\n\nLooked for reasons\n\nBut what I found in me\n\nKnow for certain\n\nThings are changing\n\nI've been changing\n\nNow I need to be\n\nHome where I can see\n\n\n\nHome before dark\n\nBefore the light escapes me\n\nTo be at your side\n\nThat's where the journey takes me\n\nAnd I've been afraid\n\nIf I lost my way\n\nThen I wouldn't be saved\n\nBefore dark\n\n\n\nI've got stories\n\nI wanna tell you\n\nYou need to hear them\n\nMaybe then you'll see\n\nThat I'd found them\n\nNever knowing\n\nThey were going\n\nOn inside of me\n\nIt's where I had to be\n\n\n\nHome before dark\n\nKnow you'll be waiting for me\n\nTo be at your door\n\nAnd talking to a fool\n\nIn the morning\n\nI've been so long\n\nIn places unknow\n\nBut I knew I'd get home\n\nBefore dark\n\n\n\nCos of you\n\nI get home\n\nBefore dark\n\n\n\n(Thanks to David for these lyrics)"
