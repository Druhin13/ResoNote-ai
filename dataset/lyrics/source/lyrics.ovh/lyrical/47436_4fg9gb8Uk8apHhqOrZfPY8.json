  "lyrics": "I am chaos. I am war. A little pestilence with a mighty sword. A little infestation, with a so-called sophistication and a presumed holy salvation. Look what I’ve become. Looking like a devil’s son. Look what I’ve become. Am I still your chosen one? Look what I’ve become. I am monstrous. I am hate. In the name of the LORD and for Heaven’s sake. A little congregation with a misread revelation and a self-proclaimed ordination. Look what I’ve become. Looking like a devil’s son. Look what I’ve become. Am I still your chosen one? Look what I’ve become. We give birth to disturbance. We are plague, every one of us. We will choke on the dirt. We are cursed. No, we are the curse. Look what I’ve become. Look what I’ve become. Hate me, fuel me. Hate me, fuel me. Hate me, fuel me. Hate me, fuel me. Hate me, fuel me."
