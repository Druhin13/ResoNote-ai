  "lyrics": "The night is alive, it's loud, and I'm drunk\r\nKissing the mic and singing about us\r\nThe songs that I make, I barely rehearse them\r\nThey're hardly mistakes, they're meant to be honest\r\nI'm way out of tune, turned up to eleven\n\nFloating around this noisy heaven\n\nMost of the words get stuck in my mouth\n\nBut I mean all the ones that punch their way out\n\n\n\nOur heads are blurry\n\nOur hearts are sharp things\n\nI bet on you\n\nTo make me nervous\n\nTo stay dangerous\n\nGood love is not safe\n\n\n\nThe night is alive, it's loud, and I'm drunk"
