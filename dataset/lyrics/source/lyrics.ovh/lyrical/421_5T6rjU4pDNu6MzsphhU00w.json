  "lyrics": "Party over here, fuck you over there \nAnd there she blows\r\nSlip into the bathroom, lock the door\r\nSniffing like a vacuum \nAnd I know that it ain't nobodies business\n\nBut last time she was in there for twenty minutes\n\nHer roommate Ruth sitting at that booth\n\nSucking on that wine like she's gonna find the truth \n\nJust wait 'till her lips turn blood red\n\nShe'll fall in love with whoever, 'nuff said\n\nAnd that's Johnson \n\nHe's always on some agro frat bro gangsta stompin'\n\nActs like he's the only white boy from Compton \n\nIf real G's show up, the attitude is gone\n\nJill forgot that they agreed no coke\n\nCause Jacks on the couch passed out with his mouth open\n\nLed Zeppelin, Stairway To Heaven\n\nStay in step cause anyone can have a weapon\n\nJust like Chad, real white trash\n\nShort fuse quick to put his foot up your ass \n\nHeads up, that's his wife Rebecca \n\nAnd I advise you to try not to smile at her\n\nAnd lets all have deep conversation\n\nAlcohol and dialogue perfect combination\n\nThrow in a cokehead or a pothead \n\nJust cant stop them thought provoking topics\n\nLook somebody puked in the fridge\n\nAin't that great, its where the beer lives\n\nThe music's too loud to hear the fire alarm\n\nAnd imma set a fire if you don't change the song\n\nC'mon\n\n\n\nNothing but love \n\nYeah there was a party, many people came through\n\nStanding on the wall, cause that's what I do\n\nSmall-talk shot dialogue push snooze\n\nDefense mechon cause I got a lotta shoes {issues}\n\nThe moment got stolen by a lady in red\n\nWith a campaign slogan about the straight edge\n\nBut her sentence is broken\n\nHer focus a fraction\n\nThe ash on her Camels at an inch and a half\n\nAnd her voice starts to crack\n\nAnd her head starts to twitch\n\nAnd Ant looks at me like, What's up with this bitch?\n\nI can tell by the stains and the way she complains\n\nThat pills ain't to blame and it ain't cocaine\n\nShes had too, too, too much coffee\n\n\n\nNate must have drank a lot of Black Label\n\nTryin' to play the Rottwieler under the table\n\nNow light another cigarette off of the stove\n\nBoth ya'll drunk, which one of ya'll drove\n\nThese people need to stay off the sauce\n\nIm shocked that the neighbors ain't called the cops\n\nThe music, the drunk, the fights out front \n\nAnd half of these kids ain't near twenty one\n\nWho's party is this, who's home is this\n\nHow'd I get here man, I do grownup shit\n\nLet me know when your games are all done\n\nCause I can't fuck with these games you call fun\n\n\n\nHave fun \n\n\n\nParty over here, fuck you over there\n\n\n\n(Thanks to the dope pope for these lyrics)"
