  "lyrics": "See the line all around the block\r\nWatch all the pretty girls looking roguishly hot\r\nRight on time, here come all the dudes\r\nThey work the room and validate their crew\r\n(Oh yeah)\n\nIt's not submission, it's just the look in her eyes\n\nThere's no decision, it's just the look in her eyes\n\n\n\nThe joint is jumping, the DJ's settin' 'em free\n\nJohnny from Brooklyn meets Marianne from Queens\n\nThey hit it off, he has all the moves\n\nShe's fascinated but leaves him looking for clues\n\n\n\nShe's not pretending, it's just the look in her eyes\n\nShe's not suggesting, it's just the look in her eyes\n\nHe leads her by the hand, he says \"Dance little sister, dance\"\n\nIs it one those nights where the stars and the moon collide, aw yeah\n\n\n\n(Don't be fooled by the look in her eyes)\n\n(Take your time)\n\n\n\nThe sun is rising, he says I'll walk you home\n\nHe's got the sweet talk, she's in her comfort zone\n\nHe's so smooth, he always gets the girl\n\nBut she ain't fooled, her mother taught her well\n\n\n\nIt's not submission, it's just the look in her eyes\n\nThere's no decision, it's just the look in her eyes\n\nShe's not pretending, it's just the look in her eyes\n\nShe's not suggesting, it's just the look in her eyes"
