  "lyrics": "Come you masters of war\r\nYou that build all the guns\r\nYou that build the death planes\r\nYou that build the big bombs\r\nYou that hide behind walls\r\nYou that hide behind desks\n\nI just want you to know\n\nI can see through your masks\n\n\n\nYou that never done nothin'\n\nBut build to destroy\n\nYou play with my world\n\nLike it's your little toy\n\nYou put a gun in my hand\n\nAnd you hide from my eyes\n\nAnd you turn and run farther\n\nWhen the fast bullets fly\n\n\n\nLike Judas of old\n\nYou lie and deceive\n\nA world war can be won\n\nYou want me to believe\n\nBut I see through your eyes\n\nAnd I see through your brain\n\nLike I see through the water\n\nThat runs down my drain\n\n\n\nYou fasten the triggers\n\nFor the others to fire\n\nThen you set back and watch\n\nWhen the death count gets higher\n\nYou hide in your mansion\n\nAs young people's blood\n\nFlows out of their bodies\n\nAnd is buried in the mud\n\n\n\nYou've thrown the worst fear\n\nThat can ever be hurled\n\nFear to bring children\n\nInto the world\n\nFor threatening my baby\n\nUnborn and unnamed\n\nYou ain't worth the blood\n\nThat runs in your veins\n\n\n\nHow much do I know\n\nTo talk out of turn\n\nYou might say that I'm young\n\nYou might say I'm unlearned\n\nBut there's one thing I know\n\nThough I'm younger than you\n\nEven Jesus would never\n\nForgive what you do\n\n\n\nLet me ask you one question\n\nIs your money that good\n\nWill it buy you forgiveness\n\nDo you think that it could\n\nI think you will find\n\nWhen your death takes its toll\n\nAll the money you made\n\nWill never buy back your soul\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that you die\n\nAnd your death'll come soon\n\nI will follow your casket\n\nIn the pale afternoon\n\nAnd I'll watch while you're lowered\n\nDown to your deathbed\n\nAnd I'll stand o'er your grave\n\n'Til I'm sure that you're dead"
