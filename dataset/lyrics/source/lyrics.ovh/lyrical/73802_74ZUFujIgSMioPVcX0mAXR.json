  "lyrics": "You're sitting in the bedroom playing the guitar\r\nWriting in a notebook your wish upon a star\r\nYou are like a snowflake melting in my hand\r\nVanish like a footstep sinking in the sand\r\nYou're living in a greenhouse playing with a stone\n\nYou wanna be a princess looking for a throne\n\nYou cry a litte teardrop when you had enough\n\nBut you don't wanna listen when I sing about love\n\n\n\nDon't wait for better days\n\nReach out and take away\n\nEverything you need\n\nThe world is at your feet\n\nInside you wanna stay\n\nDon't try to run away\n\nHold me in the sun\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\n\n\nJust around the corner there's a happy life\n\nDreaming of tomorrow when you could be a wife\n\nYou cry a litte teardrop working with your hair\n\nYou're running away from everyone who cares\n\n\n\nDon't wait for better days\n\nReach out and take away\n\nEverything you need\n\nThe world is at your feet\n\nInside you wanna stay\n\nDon't try to run away\n\nHold me in the sun\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\n\n\n(Don't run away)\n\n(Hold me in the sun)\n\n\n\nDon't wait for better days\n\nReach out and take away\n\nEverything you need\n\nThe world is at your feet\n\nInside you wanna stay\n\nDon't try to run away\n\nHold me in the sun\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\n\n\n(Don't run away)\n\n(Hold me in the sun)\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\n(Don't run away)\n\n(Hold me in the sun)\n\n(Don't run away)"
