  "lyrics": "And I get no sleep\r\nI dream underwater\r\nWhales and tigers they roll in my dreams\r\nWe can talk about it\r\nAnd I get no sleep\n\nBut I dream underwater\n\nI waste all my years laying under the stars\n\nJust dreaming 'bout it\n\n\n\nResting my bones just waiting for silence\n\nWe could all use a little more quiet\n\nWith my diary on the desk\n\nScreaming at me\n\n\n\nIt's an ineffable thing\n\nWith the wind soaring on the [wind?]\n\nThrough the nefarious night\n\nA cold hand touches me\n\nPulls me deep underwater\n\nI'm free\n\n\n\nA quiver I keep I think, It's time\n\nDown to the deep [?]\n\nStruggling to see\n\nFades black\n\nWhales [?]\n\nAt my back\n\n[?] calls me home and I\n\nBreathe underwater and so\n\nNow I'm brand new\n\n\n\nAnd I get no sleep\n\nBut I dream underwater"
