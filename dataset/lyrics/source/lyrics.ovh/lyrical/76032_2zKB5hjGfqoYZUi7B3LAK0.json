  "lyrics": "Dust to dust, dawn to dusk\r\nToo quickly we were rusting\r\nYou’ve been hiding in sandcastles\r\nYou were almost out of reach\r\nSo level it out, pick up the wind\r\nAnd conjure up the storms that I’d die to be caught in\n\n\n\nYou’ve got me feeling some sort of way\n\nAnd you can take it all the way\n\n\n\nSin eater\n\nI just want to be your sin eater\n\nBut I’m ship wrecked\n\nAnd I’ve been measuring the distance\n\nSo swim to me in this tomb\n\n\n\nHaunted by the way you pronounce my name\n\nI phased through all your body just to get a taste\n\nThen you undressed and called me out and I knew everything\n\nYou’re undressed, I’m blacking out\n\nHow can I leave?"
