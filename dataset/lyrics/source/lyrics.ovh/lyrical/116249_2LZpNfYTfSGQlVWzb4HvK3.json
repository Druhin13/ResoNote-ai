  "lyrics": "He was always Santa Claus to them\r\nEvery year he'd magically appear here in our den\r\nThey would laugh and tease and say you look a lot like Dad\r\nHe'd just smile and ask, \"Have you been good or bad?\"\r\nOh, but life ain't always like a holiday\n\nSome things change, and sometimes people go their seperate ways\n\nHe just called and said he'd like to be here for the kids\n\nWish them Merry Christmas when they open up their gifts\n\nAnd even though it might be hard on me\n\nHow can I let them down?\n\nSo Santa Claus is coming back to town\n\n\n\nHere it is Christmas Eve - the kids are sleeping\n\nLights flashing in the trees - I keep thinking\n\nTomorrow I'll see him, tomorrow I'll see him\n\n\n\nI guess I ought to try to go to bed\n\nI can't rehearse tomorrow any longer in my head\n\nHe'll walk in so nonchalant, as if he'd never gone\n\nThey'll be glad to see him, I'll be barely hanging on\n\nAnd just like that he'll go and turn my whole world upside down\n\nSanta Claus is coming back to town\n\n\n\nNo it's never really easy when this time of year rolls around\n\n'Cause Santa Claus is coming back to town"
