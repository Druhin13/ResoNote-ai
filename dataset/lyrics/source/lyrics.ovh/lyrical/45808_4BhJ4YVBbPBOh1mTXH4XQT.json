  "lyrics": "a glance back, a glance into the now\r\ntears sweeten the day, but the aftertaste is bitter\r\nwhere are the good old times, where is my dependence - bullet!\r\nin your presence my memories swallow me\r\nmoment for moment you throw me back\r\na new way, the same paths, old fears\n\nI'm the tool of my demons,\n\nthey hide the depths of my soul, in darkness\n\n(I'm not ready for this way, to open up, to give - blade!)\n\nlet me go before I end, lonely.\n\nI cannot be what I am\n\nFill me with new hope."
