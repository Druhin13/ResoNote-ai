  "lyrics": "There's no reason, there's no rhyme\r\nI found myself blindsided by\r\nA feeling that I've never known\r\nI'm dealing with it on my own\r\nPhone is quiet, walls are bare\r\nI drink myself to sleep, who cares?\n\nNo one even has to know\n\nI'm dealing with it on my own\n\n\n\nI've got way too much time to be this hurt\n\nSomebody help, it's getting worse\n\nWhat do you do with a broken heart?\n\nOnce the light fades, everything is dark\n\nWay too much whiskey in my blood\n\nI feel my body giving up\n\nCan I hold on for another night?\n\nWhat do I do with all this time?\n\n\n\nEvery thought's when it gets late\n\nPut me in a fragile state\n\nI wish I wasn't going home\n\nDealing with it on my own\n\nI'm praying but it's not enough\n\nI'm done, I don't believe in love\n\nLearning how to let it go\n\nDealing with it on my own\n\n\n\nI've got way too much time to be this hurt\n\nSomebody help, it's getting worse\n\nWhat do you do with a broken heart?\n\nOnce the light fades, everything is dark\n\nWay too much whiskey in my blood\n\nI feel my body giving up\n\nCan I hold on for another night?\n\nWhat do I do with all this time? Yeah\n\n\n\nI drive circles under street lights\n\nNothing seems to clear my mind\n\nI can't forget\n\nIt's inside my head, so\n\nI drive, chasing Malibu nights\n\nNothing seems to heal my mind\n\nI can't forget\n\n\n\nI've got way too much time to be this hurt\n\nSomebody help, it's getting worse\n\nWhat do you do with a broken heart?\n\nOnce the light fades, everything is dark\n\nWay too much whiskey in my blood\n\nI feel my body giving up\n\nCan I hold on for another night?\n\nWhat do I do with all this time? Yeah\n\n\n\nI drive circles under street lights\n\nNothing seems to clear my mind\n\nI can't forget\n\nIt's inside my head, so\n\nI drive, chasing Malibu nights\n\nNothing seems to heal my mind\n\nI can't forget\n\n(It's inside my head, so)\n\nI drive, chasing Malibu nights\n\nHey, hey, na-na"
