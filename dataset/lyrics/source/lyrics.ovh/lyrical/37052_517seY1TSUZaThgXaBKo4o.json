  "lyrics": "They say you lived in a house in the clouds\r\nAnd from up there it all did seem so true\r\nWas it you who I saw?\r\nWas it you who I saw?\r\nWas it you?\n\n\n\nSomebody said, you lie in the night upon the sand\n\nAnd from down there you knew every shape of the moon\n\n\n\nWas it you who I saw?\n\nWas it you who I saw?\n\nWas it you?\n\n\n\nWas it you who I saw in the cold?\n\nMy heart was almost shaking\n\nWas it you who I could never hold?\n\nYour eyes weren't made for waiting\n\nWas it you who never got old?\n\n\n\nThey say you found a home in the wind\n\nAnd every blow was magic to the skin\n\n\n\nWas it you who I saw?\n\nWas it you who I saw?\n\nWas it you?"
