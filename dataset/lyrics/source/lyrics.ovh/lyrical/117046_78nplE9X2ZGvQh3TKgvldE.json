  "lyrics": "You know I want you\r\nIt's not a secret I try to hide\r\nYou know you want me\r\nSo don’t keep saying our hands are tied\r\nYou claim it's not in the cards\r\nAnd faith is pulling you miles away\n\nAnd out of a reach from me\n\nBut you're hearing my heart\n\nSo who can stop me if I decide it’s on my destiny?\n\n\n\nWhat if we rewrite the stars?\n\nSay you were made to be mine\n\nNothing could keep us apart\n\nYou'll be the one I was meant to find\n\nIt's up to you, and it's up to me\n\nNo one could say what we get to be\n\nSo why don't we rewrite the stars?\n\nAnd maybe the world could be ours tonight\n\n\n\nYou think it's easy\n\nYou think I don't wanna grow onto you, yeah\n\nBut there are mountains (But there are mountains)\n\nAnd there are doors that we can't walk through\n\nI know you’re wondering why\n\nBecause we’re able to be just you and me within these walls\n\nBut when we go outside\n\nYou're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all\n\n\n\nNo one can rewrite the stars (Rewrite the stars)\n\nHow can you say you’ll be mine?\n\nEverything keeps us apart\n\nAnd I'm not the one you were meant to find\n\n(I'm not the one you were meant to find)\n\nIt's not up to you, it’s not up to me, yeah\n\nWhen everyone tells us what we can be (Tells us what we can)\n\nAnd how can we rewrite the stars?\n\nSay that the world can be ours tonight (Be ours)\n\n\n\nAll I want is to fly with you\n\nAll I want is to fall with you\n\nSo just give me all of you\n\nIt feels impossible\n\nIt's not impossible\n\nIs it impossible?\n\nSay that it's possible\n\n\n\nAnd how do we rewrite the stars?\n\nSay you were made to be mine\n\nAnd nothing can keep us apart\n\n'Cause you are the one I was meant to find\n\nIt's up to you, and it's up to me\n\nNo one could say what we get to be\n\nAnd why don't we rewrite the stars?\n\nChanging the world to be ours\n\n\n\nYou know I want you\n\nIt's not a secret I try to hide\n\nBut I can't have you\n\nWe're bound to break and my hands are tied"
