You bought a brand new truck\n\nAnd now you wanna pick me up\n\nWell, honey I don't give a-\n\nA care about you\n\n\n\nIf you wanna go out and take me on the dance floor\n\nSpin me around and tell me that you want more\n\nWell, I ain't having this conversation\n\nNo more Friday night lipstick wasted\n\nAll of my time drink, drinking your Kool-Aid\n\nSpending my dimes and my kisses on you, babe\n\nIf you're thinking that I'm on the fence\n\nThinking I want you back, nah\n\nBaby, I'm good, ay\n\nBaby, I'm good\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm good, baby, I'm good, yeah\n\nYou know what, baby? I'm good\n\nGoodbye, goodbye\n\nI'm only wishing you would just have a nice life\n\nYou know what, baby? I'm good\n\nGoodbye, goodbye\n\nGoodbye, goodbye, ay\n\n\n\nSo if you wanna go out and take me on the dance floor\n\nSpin me around and tell me that you want more\n\nI ain't having this conversation\n\nNo more Friday night lipstick wasted\n\nAll of my time drink, drinking your Kool-Aid\n\nSpending my dimes and my kisses on you, babe\n\nIf you're thinking that I'm on the fence\n\nThinking I want you back, nah\n\nBaby, I'm good, ay\n\nBaby, I'm good, ooo\n\nBaby, I'm good, yeah\n\nSo good"
