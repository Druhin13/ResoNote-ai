  "lyrics": "Have mercy, baby on a poor girl like me,\r\nYou know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet,\r\nI'm tingling right from my head to my toes,\r\nSo help me, help me, help me make the feeling go.\r\n'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,\r\nAnd there's not another living soul around,\n\nThen you woo me until the sun comes up,\n\nAnd you say that you love me.\n\nHave pity baby,\n\nJust when I thought it was over,\n\nNow you got me running, running, running for cover.\n\nI'm begging you for a little sympathy,\n\n'Cause if you use me again it'll be the end of me.\n\n'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,\n\nAnd there's not another living soul around,\n\nThen you woo me until the sun comes up,\n\nAnd you say that you love me.\n\nBaby, baby, hope you're gonna stay away,\n\n'Cause I'm getting weaker, weaker everyday,\n\nI guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,\n\nAnd if you use me again it'll be the end of me.\n\n'Cause when the loving starts, and the lights go down,\n\nAnd there's not another living soul around,\n\nThen you woo me until the sun comes up,\n\nAnd you say that you love me.\n\nFallin' fallin' fallin\n\nFallin' fallin' fallin"
