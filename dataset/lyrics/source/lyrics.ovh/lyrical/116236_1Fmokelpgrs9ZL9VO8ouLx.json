  "lyrics": "On Christmas Eve in 1818, a blizzard stranded the tiny\r\nvillage of Obendorf nestled in the Austrian\r\nMountains. That same day, the people of St. Nicholas's\r\nChurch found their organ broken. So the priest and\r\norganist began composing a song that could be sung\r\nwithout an organ, yet beautiful enough to express\n\ntheir Christmas joy. All day and all night long they\n\nworked. And at midnight, the gentle carol \"Silent\n\nNight\" was born. The pure clear tones echoed through\n\nthe hills. And the world has been captured by the\n\nbeauty of that simple song ever since.\n\n\n\nSilent night, holy night\n\nAll is calm, all is bright\n\nRound yon virgin mother and child\n\nHoly infant so tender and mild\n\nSleep in heavenly peace\n\nSleep in heavenly peace\n\n\n\nSilent night, holy night\n\nShepherds quake at the sight\n\nGlory streams from Heaven afar\n\nHeavenly hosts sing Hallelujah\n\nChrist the Savior is born\n\nChrist the Savior is born\n\n\n\nSilent night, holy night\n\nAll is calm, and all is bright\n\nRound yon virgin mother and child\n\nHoly infant so tender and mild\n\nSleep in heavenly peace\n\nSleep in heavenly peace\n\n\n\nSilent night, holy night\n\nSleep in heavenly peace"
