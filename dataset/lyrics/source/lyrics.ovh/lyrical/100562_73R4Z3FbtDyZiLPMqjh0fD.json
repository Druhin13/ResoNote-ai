Who the hell knows\n\nNightmares hearing my coffin drop on my cell clothes\n\nWe was outside since Ludacris was throwing elbows\n\nShell toes, PS2 in grand theft codes\n\nNew class think strew because they wearing do rags\n\nToo bad they couldn't clip my wings before I flew past\n\nI woke up to 100 missed calls and another withdrawal\n\nWhat should I quit for, I pour up and sip more\n\nThe I drift off, Granny still in church praying on that pick for\n\nIt could be worse, I could still be on that sixth floor\n\nPutting work, then the outcome you get what you wish for"
