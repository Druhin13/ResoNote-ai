  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson I Guess... I Suppose... par The Fratellis\r\nWell I hide like sunshine, see how I climb\nHowl like a devil til it’s safe enough for me to come home\nI'll come home\nI’ll be there with bells on waiting for relief\nAnd I know I can get there, feel everywhere\nE equals mc squared til it’s safe to come home\nI'll come home\nI’ll be there when you make it worth my while\n\nImagine the scene\nUs lost in between\nThe north and the south\nEast and west of the strange and obscene\nI pick you a rose\nAnd everything slows\n\nI fall to my knees in a squeeze\nOh I guess I suppose\n\nHa ha take your sister to the river\nDon’t forget to give her best wishes from me\nThis life is a complicated business\nCan I get a witness to my own history\n\nWell i feel like nothing, everybody bluffing\nSleep til my bones unwind and I'll dare to come home\nI'll come home\nI’ll be there with my dress hitched up, no joke\n\nImagine the scene\nUs lost in between\nThe north and the south\nEast and west of the strange and obscene\n\nI pick you a rose\nAnd everything slows\nI fall to my knees in a squeeze\nOh I guess I suppose\n\nHa ha take your sister to the river\nDon’t forget to give her best wishes from me\nThis life is a complicated business\nCan I get a witness to my own history\n\nSlow days are too much for me to handle\nBurning out the candle is the perfect reply\nYour face has the makings of a scandal\nFrom a viper to a vandal wave your troubles goodbye\n\nHa ha take a stroll out of the city\nWhy does only pretty rhyme with city, what a pity\n\nCome down from your high horse Mary\nI don’t mean to be contrary but when was the last time\nYou saw your reflection in the water\nDon’t you think you ought to check your eyesight sometime\nYou’ll see a reprieve and a repose\nHow long God only knows\nI guess I suppose\nHa ha\nHa ha"
