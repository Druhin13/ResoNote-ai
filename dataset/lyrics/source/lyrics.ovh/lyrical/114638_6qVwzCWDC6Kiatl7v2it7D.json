  "lyrics": "If there's a God\r\nDo you think he's looking down, curled up on his couch right now?\r\nAs we fail to figure it out, does he turn down the sound?\r\nIs he proud? Are we proud?\r\nGuess we forgot how to live a life with no filter\r\nMaking boring people famous\n\nLet's pretend they're fascinating\n\nLet's tell little girls that pretty girls are better\n\nOr that pigment or religion really matters\n\n\n\nWere in some trouble\n\nMr. Maker, don't turn away from your screen\n\nAt least the bubble that we've created could make for some good TV\n\n\n\nOh Mr. Man upstairs\n\nI know you're tuning in up there, way up there\n\nWould you care to answer my question?\n\nOh, the land of our taste\n\nThe spectacle of cut and paste\n\nThat we've made\n\nWould you say? Please say\n\nIt was worth the seven days\n\n\n\nDoes he hang his head in all the greed that we possess?\n\nAs the anti-social media perpetuates the mess\n\nMaybe it's a test, maybe he's upset by the [?] stress\n\nLike the rest of us, it happens to the best of us\n\nGod, or is it Mr. G to me?\n\nI hope that through the static you show what's the clarity\n\n'Cause it's hard to find the silver lining in the bittersweet\n\nWonder if you're praying for us 'fore you go to sleep\n\nDo you sleep in peace?\n\n\n\n'Cause were in some trouble\n\nMr. Maker, but don't turn away from your screen\n\nAt least the bubble that we've created has made for damn good TV\n\n\n\nOh, Mr. Man upstairs\n\nI know you're tuning in up there, way up there\n\nWould you care to answer my question?\n\nOh, the land of our taste\n\nThe spectacle of cut and paste\n\nThat we've made\n\nWould you say? Please say\n\nIt was worth the seven days\n\n\n\nDon't touch the remote\n\nIt'll be back in a moment\n\nWe are not hopeless\n\nWe are just coping\n\nThe mayhem is rolling\n\nBut it ain't showbiz\n\nReality's potent\n\nChaotic, I know it\n\nBut we're growing\n\nHave some hope in us\n\nAnd were we worth all the time you gave us?\n\n\n\nOh, Mr. Man upstairs\n\nI know you're tuning in up there, way up there\n\nWould you care to answer my question?\n\nOh, the land of our taste\n\nThe spectacle of cut and paste\n\nThat we've made\n\nWould you say? Please say\n\nIt was worth the seven days, yeah"
