  "lyrics": "At fifteen we had to leave the States again\r\nDad was stationed at an RAF base they called Mildenhall\r\nBlack moss on a busted wall\r\nThe cobblestones made it hard to skate\r\nI thought my flattop was so new wave\r\nUntil it melted away in the Suffolk rain\n\nWell god damn, you miss the USA\n\n\n\nThen a kid in class passed me a tape\n\nAn invitation, not the hand of fate\n\n\n\nI guess my shoes said I might relate\n\nSomehow she knew I'd like to stay up waiting with her in the cold\n\nFor cheap beer and rock 'n roll\n\nWhich in time put lots of things in my mind\n\n\n\nA kid in class passed me a tape\n\nWe saw some bands down at the Corn Exchange\n\n\n\nI wonder where my sister was that night\n\nBack at home under the tanning bed lights\n\nI can still see the glow\n\nStrange rays from her window\n\nEach night, as I was skating home\n\nStarted messing with my dad's guitar\n\nTaught me some chords just to start me off\n\nWhittling away on those rainy days\n\nAnd that's how we get to where we are now\n\n\n\nA kid in class passed me a tape\n\nA band called The Jesus and the Mary Chain\n\n\n\nI started messing with my dad's guitar\n\nHe taught me some chords just to start me off\n\nWhittling away on all of those rainy days\n\nAnd that's how we get to where we are now\n\nAnd that's how we get to where we are now"
