  "lyrics": "(Right..)(Right..)\r\nCheck me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area\r\nAbout to cause mass hysteria\r\n[Nas]\r\nBefore a blunt, I take out my fronts\n\nThen I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt\n\nYou couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer\n\nThat's like Malcolm X, catchin the Jungle Fever\n\nKing poetic, too much flavor, I'm major\n\nAtlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager\n\nCause I'm an ace when I face the bass\n\n40-side is the place that is givin me grace\n\nNow wait, another dose and you might be dead\n\nAnd I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds\n\nAnd ain't a damn thing gonna change\n\nI'ma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain\n\nNas, why did you do it?\n\nYou know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime\n\n\n\n(Right..) It's halftime\n\n(Right..) Aiyyo it's halftime\n\n(Right..) It's halftime\n\n(Right..) Yeah, it's about halftime\n\nThis is how it feel, check it out, how it feel\n\n\n\n[Nas]\n\nIt's like that, you know it's like that\n\nI got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back\n\nWhen I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back\n\nSo I react never calmly on a hype track\n\nI set it off with my own rhyme\n\nCause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time\n\nI'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex\n\nIn ya, stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck\n\nI used to hustle - now all I do is relax and strive\n\nWhen I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5\n\nI drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it\n\nWith more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\n\nNasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise\n\nThis is exercise 'til the microphone dies\n\nBack in eighty-three I was an MC sparkin\n\nBut I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and\n\nkick my little raps cause I thought niggaz wouldn't understand\n\nAnd now in every jam I'm the fuckin man\n\nI rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships\n\nI used to watch \"C.H.I.P.S.\" now I load glock clips\n\nI got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic\n\nVersatile, my style switches like a faggot\n\nBut not bisexual, I'm an intellectual\n\nOf rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo\n\nThese are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand\n\nCause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man\n\nIn my place wit the bass and format\n\nExplore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that\n\nAnd next time I rhyme, I be foul\n\nWhenever I freestyle I see trial niggaz say I'm wild\n\nI hate a rhymebiter's rhyme\n\nStay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime\n\n\n\n(Right..) It's halftime\n\n(Right..) Exhale, check it it's halftime\n\n(Right..) It's halftime\n\n(Right..) It's real in the field\n\nWord life, check it\n\n\n\n[Nas]\n\nI got it goin on, even flip 'em on this song\n\nEvery afternoon, I kick half the tune\n\nAnd in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit\n\nWord to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it\n\nCause when I blast the herb, that's my word\n\nI be slayin them fast, doing this that and the third\n\nBut chill, past to Andre, and let's slay\n\nI bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee\n\nPuttin hits on 5-0\n\nCause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo'-fo'\n\nAnd biters can't come near\n\nAnd yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia\n\nI won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed\n\nThat's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed\n\nThis goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten\n\nBrooklyn and Queens is livin fat and\n\nThe Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout\n\nIll Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out\n\n\n\n(Right..) It's still halftime\n\n(Right..) To the Queensbridge crew\n\nTo the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime\n\n(Right..) Ninety-two, it's halftime\n\n(Right..) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost\n\nHalftime.."
