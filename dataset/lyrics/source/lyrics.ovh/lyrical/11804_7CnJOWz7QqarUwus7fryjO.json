  "lyrics": "I forget sometimes to remember\r\nWrite it down before I lose it\r\nThe assessment comes and I surrender\r\nIt happens every time\r\nAnd there's no indication anybody's ever\r\nGotten it right and has the answer\n\nBut that won't make you wake up feeling any better\n\nYou don't need to remind me at all\n\nWe’ve all been lost sometimes\n\nWe’ve all felt left behind\n\nYou can't let that define you\n\nThere's never any signs to\n\nShow you where to go\n\nLike you're supposed to know what's right\n\nHurry up and pick your side\n\nSomeone told me once that age was just a number\n\nI never found no comfort there\n\nThen I realized ‘cause maybe I was younger\n\nThat I don't really care\n\nCause I don't make the rules but I learned how to bend them\n\nA lesson learned could still be taught\n\nAnd if I forgot a few well don't get too offended\n\nI guess it's all my fault\n\nIt's all my fault\n\nSometimes things go right\n\nIt's never overnight\n\nBut don't get too excited\n\nI don't think you're invited\n\nIf everybody's changing\n\nAnd if you still feel the same things\n\nThen tell me who's to blame this time"
