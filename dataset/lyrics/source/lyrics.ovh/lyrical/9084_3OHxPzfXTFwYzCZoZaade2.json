  "lyrics": "What could be sweeter than you?\r\nMic check, is this thing on?\r\nI ain't even know if I would rap or just sing on\r\nIt took me awhile but now I'm getting my swing on\r\nIcarus in increments sometimes I put wings on\n\nEvery hero ain't a hero 'til there's a theme song\n\nSo many tries but every time it just seemed wrong\n\nSaturday night just kicking it with my best man\n\nLooked at my left hand, I got a ring on (oh shit)\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nStarted with a kiss then another kiss then another kiss\n\nThen a covered dish with white rice, greens, and smothered fish\n\nI'm lying, it was just chicken, niggas was thugging it\n\nNow we got a covenant it's on, a bond for life\n\nIn all my years this was the easiest song to write\n\nIt's my confession in a rhyme, a testament and I\n\nJust wanna do my thing as I talk about a feeling that cannot be explained\n\nOr a love that cannot be contained in a measurement or time\n\nSome say it was a blessing in disguise\n\nScratch that girl, you a lesson from the skies\n\nAnd I thank God for my winnings that's word to Lyfe Jennings\n\nFinally letting go of the mistakes of my twenties\n\nI admit that I am not an easy sell\n\nBut I'm the Petey to your Chiwetel\n\nYour big boy that tell them bitches pay your beeper bill\n\nMy nigga be for real swore I wouldn't do it again\n\nMy man said that'll change\n\nFirst time is all about working through your baggage\n\nThe second time around it's all about the baggage claim\n\nThank your maker, stack your paper\n\nWith a real one, major key, clavinet\n\nLeave them other hoes on read like clarinets\n\nGorgeous, no wrongs in this love song I wrote for us\n\nWedding play all day with no chorus, let's ride\n\n\n\nGirl it's you it's you and you're on my mind\n\nGirl it's you it's you and you're on my mind\n\nGirl it's you it's you and you're on my mind\n\nGirl it's you it's you and you're on my mind"
