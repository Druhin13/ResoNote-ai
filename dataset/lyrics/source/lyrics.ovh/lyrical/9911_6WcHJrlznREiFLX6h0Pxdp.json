  "lyrics": "I don't know if I can let it go\r\nMy fingers clenched white as snow\r\nYou packed your world in a wooden suitcase\r\nWhat you left behind time can't erase\r\nWe spent fifty-two years giving all we had\n\nRaised seven kids on that plot of land\n\nThere's still your loose change and your buttons on your washing stand\n\nYou left one big house for this lonely man\n\n\n\nWell, I miss holding your hands on Sunday\n\nTalking over the TV\n\nWatching the Braves games\n\nAnd I know that the good Lord called you up yonder\n\nI guess what they say is true\n\n'Cause your absence makes this weary heart grow fonder\n\n\n\nI found your old cook books but the biscuits ain't right\n\nAnd how do you work this damn coffee pot\n\nAnd all my shirt tails are wrinkled, and bed is still made\n\n'Cause your smell still lingers on where you laid\n\n\n\nAnd I hung up all your dresses and the dogs they're doing fine\n\nBut I can't remember the brand you used to buy\n\nAnd Molly got her braces off and she smiles so big\n\nDavie is still as skinny as a whittled old twig\n\n\n\nAnd I miss holding your hands on Sundays\n\nTalking over the TV\n\nWatching the Braves games\n\nAnd I know that the good Lord called you up yonder\n\nI guess what they say is true\n\n'Cause your absence makes this weary heart grow fonder\n\n\n\nWell I miss holding your hands on Sundays\n\nTalking over the TV\n\nWatching the Braves games\n\nAnd I know that the good Lord called you up yonder\n\nI guess what they say is true\n\n'Cause your absence makes this weary heart grow fonder\n\n\n\nAnd Jason and Margaret they're expecting one more\n\nYou'd be happy to know I fixed that cabinet door"
