  "lyrics": "Gathered for this mess\r\nAbandon all that you know\r\nYou say that you're not blind\r\nYet you can't see which way the river flows\r\nThe engines start to seize\n\nThe walls begin to close\n\nThe betrayal that you see\n\nYet you can't see which way the river flows\n\n\n\nThe end, it has begun\n\nSo blind that you can't see\n\nVisions that don't exist\n\nOf despair and misery\n\nAs you sink forever further\n\nThe quicksand in your mind\n\nAs the day turns into mind\n\nYou choose what you shall find\n\n\n\nAs the waters pull you under\n\nWith nowhere left to go\n\nYou say you see tomorrow\n\nYet you can't see which way the river flows"
