  "lyrics": "I'm goin' where the water rolls, Moses knows the way\r\nTo my tin roof shanty by the railroad sign where the whistle blows for days\r\nWhere the mountains bare the face, of an injun brave\r\nAnd the green fields fade such a beautiful gray\r\nLook away, look away\n\nHear the homeward call of the mockingbird\n\nGone to town just like a banjo ringin' from a dime store curb\n\nSee the sign on the cross, sayin' \"Brother ain't you heard?\"\n\nThat this is the land where salvation ain't a dirty word\n\n\n\nCold bottled milk and honey mean more than a pocket full of money\n\nOh Mama can you feel me drawin' near?\n\nBeen lovin' you down through the years\n\nEven on the darkest days\n\nLook away, look away\n\n\n\nI'm goin' where the cotton grows in rows of snowy bales\n\nWhere a man and a mule don't look much different to the boss man's scale\n\nWhere the long leaf pine hide a secret place\n\nThat everybody knows what it looks like but can't nobody see\n\n\n\nCold bottled milk and honey mean more than a pocket full of money\n\nOh Mama can you feel me drawin' near?\n\nKeep lovin' you down through the years\n\nEven on the darkest days\n\nI look away, I look away\n\nTo that [?] around the sun still spinnin' and shinin' over the Lee Highway\n\nI look away, I look away, Dixieland\n\n\n\nI'm goin' where the water rolls, Moses knows the way\n\nTo my old homestead where the lights I trimmed and burnin' 'til day\n\nWhere the singin' river flows, and it knows every name\n\nOf a thousand years of footsteps chasin' its wide domain\n\n\n\nCold bottled milk and honey mean more than a pocket full of money\n\nOh Mama can you feel me drawin' near?\n\nKeep lovin' you down through the years\n\nEven on the darkest days\n\nI look away, I look away\n\nTo that [?] around the sun still spinnin' and shinin' over the Lee Highway\n\nOh I look away, I look away"
