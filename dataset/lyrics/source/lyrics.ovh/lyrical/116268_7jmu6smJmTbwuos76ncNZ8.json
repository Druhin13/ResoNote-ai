  "lyrics": "There's a box hidden under my bed\r\nFull of all the thoughts I never have said\r\nThings I'm too afraid to say to my friends\r\nWords I'm too shame to say that I said\r\nThe songs that I sing are a bit off key\r\nIt's hard to play to the melody when all I see\n\nIs people on the streets who keep asking me for peace\n\nNow it's hard for me to sleep when I got thoughts like these\n\n\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\n\n\nKeys were arranged in an order that was made\n\nTo keep everyone in place, then the melody was changed\n\nThe thoughts in my head that I boxed away\n\nWere replaced with a photo on my facebook page\n\nThe writings on the wall, but it's hard to see\n\nWhen they tell us this is how it was meant to be\n\nA man on the street held a sign up to me\n\nThat said, \"Don't believe everything that you read\"\n\n\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\n\n\nI've got my back to the wall\n\nI feel the weight of it all\n\nYou said it's all in my head\n\nThis city left us for dead (left us for dead, left us for dead)\n\nThis city left us for dead (left us for dead, left us for dead)\n\nThis city left us for dead\n\n\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody\n\nBlack keys don't like the white keys\n\nWhite keys won't play to the melody"
