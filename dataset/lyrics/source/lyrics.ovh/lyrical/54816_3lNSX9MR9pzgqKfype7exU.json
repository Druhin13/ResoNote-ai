  "lyrics": "In the evening by the moonlight\rWhen my mother had finished working\rWe used to sit around the fire place\rTill the cornbread it was done\rAnd then we all would eat our supper\rAfter that we'd clean the kitchen\rIt's the only time they ever gave us to spare\rTo have a little fun\rThen my daddy used to take his fiddle down\rThat hung upon the wall\rWhile the silvery moon was shining clear and bright\rHow the folks would enjoy it\rThey would sit all night and listen\rAs we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight\rIn the evening by the moonlight\rYou could hear banjos ringing\rYou could hear them by the moonlight\rYou could hear my folks all singing\rHow my mother she would enjoy it\rShe would sit all night and listen\rAs we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah\rIn the evening by the moonlight\rYou could hear folks all singing\rIn the evening by the moonlight\rYou could hear my folks all singing\rHow my mother she would enjoy it\rShe would sit all night and listen\rAs we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah\rIn the evening by the moonlight\rYou could hear banjos ringing\rIn the evening by the moonlight\rYou could hear my folks all singing\rHow my mother she would enjoy it\rShe would sit all night and listen\rAs we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah"
