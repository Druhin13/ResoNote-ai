  "lyrics": "I've given you no reason\r\nJust the silent treatment\r\nWhile I've given myself the benefit of my own doubt\r\nFor it's far too way from crying\r\nLiving and slowly dying\r\nDespite all our efforts to shut it down\n\n\n\nI've never seen someone like you\n\nThe one that I've made you into\n\n\n\nI want you to come closer\n\nMaybe treat me better\n\nMaybe a little meaner\n\nDoes it take work?\n\nI hate when you can resist me\n\nDon't step on my fantasy\n\nDon't come to life\n\nDon't come to life\n\nDon't come alive\n\n\n\nIn the comfort of my daydream\n\nYou're everything that I need\n\nEven when you're back in your local time\n\nWe expand into an ocean\n\nA story unspoken\n\nAnd my name is always in the pipeline\n\n\n\nI've never seen someone like you\n\nThe one that I've made you into\n\n\n\nI want you to come closer\n\nMaybe treat me better\n\nMaybe a little meaner\n\nDoes it take work?\n\nI hate when you can resist me\n\nDon't step on my fantasy\n\nDon't come to life\n\nDon't come to life\n\nDon't come alive\n\n\n\nI want you to come closer, closer, closer\n\nI want you to come closer, closer, closer\n\n\n\nI want you to come closer\n\nMaybe treat me better\n\nMaybe a little meaner\n\nDoes it take work?\n\nI hate when you can resist me\n\nDon't step on my fantasy\n\nDon't come to life\n\nDon't come to life\n\nDon't come alive"
