  "lyrics": "Now just so we're clear\r\nThe one you waited for is right here\r\nI hope you're ready for it my dear\r\nDon't speak the truth too loudly, might hear\r\n'Cause you get one shot, I hope your aim is steady\r\n'Cause you've got the whole world watching ready\n\nOr not, your heartbeat heavy and it\n\nWon't stop\n\n\n\nSo tell me how bad, tell me, tell me how bad do you...\n\n\n\nWant it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nAre you willing to fight, willing to die\n\nFor it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nReady to leave it on the line\n\nFor it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\n\nFrom it, 'cause you're wanted\n\nYou're wanted\n\n\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nYou're wanted!\n\n\n\nYou can play the game or you can watch them slander\n\nYour name. The truth, it doesn't matter\n\nThe flame is being fuelled by chatter but don't change\n\nWhen you're on the run no turning back\n\nThe damage is done. You're nothing but a savage...\n\nSomeone. No going back to where you came from\n\n\n\nSo tell me how bad, tell me, tell me how bad do you...\n\n\n\nWanted, 'cause you're wanted\n\nAre you willing to fight, willing to die\n\nFor it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nReady to leave it on the line\n\nFor it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\n\nFrom it, 'cause you're wanted\n\nYou're wanted\n\n\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nHow bad do you want it?\n\nYou're wanted!\n\n\n\nPlaster my pictures so the world will not forget my face\n\nI guess that being infamous is not the same as fame\n\nAssign me words you know my reputation can't escape\n\nYou point your finger long enough, you'll find someone to blame\n\n(Wanted, you're wanted) My character in flames\n\n(Wanted, you're wanted) But I will not be ashamed\n\n(Wanted, you're wanted) Just don't forget my name\n\nI did it once, and I'd do it all again\n\n\n\nWanted, 'cause you're wanted\n\nAre you willing to fight, willing to die\n\nFor it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nReady to leave it on the line\n\nFor it? 'Cause you're wanted\n\nNowhere to run, nowhere to hide\n\nFrom it, 'cause you're wanted\n\nYou're wanted\n\n\n\nHow bad do you want it\n\nHow bad do you want it\n\nHow bad do you want it\n\nYou want it"
