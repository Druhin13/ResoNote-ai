  "lyrics": "Tour was up middle of June\r\nShe was plannin' a welcome home barbecue\r\nGreen bean casserole, grandma's recipe\r\nThere was a knock on the door around two o'clock\r\nTwo uniforms and her heart stopped\r\nYellow ribbon 'round an oak tree, blowin' in the breeze\n\n\n\nHere's to the ones that didn't make it back home\n\nThe ones we ain't seen in so long\n\nThe hold up a beer ones\n\nThe wish they were here ones\n\nThe not forgotten but gone\n\nIn a better place up there\n\nBut they sure left a hole down here\n\nWe just go on livin' and go on missin'\n\nThe ones, the ones that didn't make it back home\n\n\n\nThe whole town shut down, the whole town showed up\n\nSang Amazing Grace, watched a slide show of\n\nHis 22 years, there was laughs and there was tears\n\nAnd that preacher talked about sacrifice\n\nAnd traffic stopped for them Cadillac lights\n\nJohnny sold beer half priced that night\n\nAnd everybody raised 'em high singin'\n\n\n\nHere's to the ones that didn't make it back home\n\nThe ones we ain't seen in so long\n\nThe hold up a beer ones\n\nThe wish they were here ones\n\nThe not forgotten but gone\n\nIn a better place up there\n\nBut they sure left a hole down here\n\nWe just go on livin' and go on missin'\n\nThe ones, the ones that didn't make it back home\n\n\n\nBack to that front porch\n\nBack through that front door\n\nTo the life they were fightin' for\n\n\n\nHere's to the ones that didn't make it back home\n\nThe ones we ain't seen in so long\n\nThe hold up a beer ones\n\nThe wish they were here ones\n\nThe not forgotten but gone\n\nIn a better place up there\n\nBut they sure left a hole down here\n\nWe just go on livin' and go on missin'\n\nThe ones, the ones that didn't make it back home\n\nThe ones that didn't make it back home"
