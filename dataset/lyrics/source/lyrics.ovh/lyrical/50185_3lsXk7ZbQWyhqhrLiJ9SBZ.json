  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson You Can Have Him par Nina Simone\r\nI don't want him you can have him\nHe's not worth fighting for\nBesides there's plenty more where he came from\nI don't want him you can have him\nI'm giving him the sack\nAnd he can go right back where he came from\nI'm afraid I never loved him\nSweetie he'd be better off with you\nI could never make him happy\n\nAll I ever wanted to do was\nRun my fingers through his curly locks\nMend his underwear and darn his socks\nFetch his slippers and remove his shoes\nWipe his glasses when he's read the news\nRub his forehead with a gentle touch\n\nMornings after when he's had a little too much\n\nKiss him gently when he cuddles near\nAnd give him babies one for every year\n\nSo you see that I don't want him you can have him\nYou can have him cos I don't want him\nBecause he's not the man for me\nThen I'd close the window while he soundly slept\nThen I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept\nI'd fix the breakfast that would please him most\nEggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast\nOh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers\nAnd when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed\n\nSo you see that I don't want him you can have him\n\nYou can have him cos I don't want him because he's not my man\nI don't want him you can have him\nYou can have him I don't want him\nYou can have him I don't want him\nCos he's not the man for me"
