  "lyrics": "I can't say that I saw it coming\r\nBut it's true that I wasn't surprised\r\nNever made much sense of your heavy sigh\r\nAnd I wish that you could have said something\r\n'Cause I know how you've had to disguise\n\nCan you crack a smile, and pretend you're fine?\n\n\n\nIs it true?\n\nYou've been away so long\n\nYou withdrew\n\nAnd couldn't bear to talk about it, or live without it\n\n\n\nHolding, waiting\n\nWill only turn you on the ones in the way\n\nSo you can't act content\n\nAnd who's to say they're gonna push you away?\n\nIt means more to you than it does to them\n\nSo don't you justify\n\nLiving silent, under wraps\n\n\n\nI feel like I ran with a head start\n\nAnd you're only just starting to live\n\nGot a lot to gain, and a lot to give\n\n\n\nAnd it breaks me up to think about\n\n'Cause I know that you don't wanna miss\n\nAnything at all, just because of this\n\n\n\nIs it true?\n\nYou've been away so long\n\nYou withdrew\n\nAnd couldn't bear to talk about it, live without it\n\n\n\nHolding, waiting\n\nWill only turn you on the ones in the way\n\nSo you can't act content\n\nBut who's to say they're gonna push you away?\n\nIt means more to you than does to them\n\nSo don't you justify\n\nLiving silent, under wraps\n\n\n\n[Outro]\n\nThe moment that you tell them's\n\nThe end of where you're at\n\nAnd once it's set in motion\n\nYou will not be looking back\n\n\n\nAnd what they thought was perfect\n\nAnd what they thought was fact\n\nWill uncover a beauty\n\nThat they never could expect\n\n\n\nThe moment that you them's\n\nThe end of where you're at\n\nAnd once it's set in motion\n\nYou will not be looking back\n\n\n\nAnd what they thought was perfect\n\nAnd what they thought was fact\n\nWill uncover a beauty\n\nThat they could never expect\n\n\n\nThe moment that you tell them's\n\nThe end of where you're at\n\nAnd once it's set in motion\n\nYou will not be looking back"
