  "lyrics": "Chill 'em loaded, I was dying to smoke\r\nMy waves roll, you can even catch microwaves like styrofoam\r\nI birth niggas like condom holes\r\nYou LA when that sun on them most, you just kinda cold\r\nGet the bars, hungry hippos and gobble more\r\nBut ain't nobody tryin' ride on us, we cobblestones\n\nThe record's long as caddies, or daddy on\n\nBut still keep it low key Boo Radley in Maycomb\n\nPlay Cole Brown when you come around\n\nYou gon' get the get the step that Martin passed out\n\nNiggas thinkin' I'm mister Green Mile like they can steal the el\n\nI done kept it smoother than Brazilian peels\n\nI peep these losers catch a billion feels\n\nI only build with you if it's real to real with the R-E-A\n\nYou whorey-ite take a hike shopping orea\n\nThe flow got a hard swing like parts in the eight\n\nThe buzz come a bunch-\n\n\n\nAbout to do a house call\n\nPayback's at your fucking face\n\nAnd then we slide into your brain\n\n[?]\n\nI'm gon take you higher later\n\nJust let me slide into your brain\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Big Tone]"
