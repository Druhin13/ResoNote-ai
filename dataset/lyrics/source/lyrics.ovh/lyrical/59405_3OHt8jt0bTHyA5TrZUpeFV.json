  "lyrics": "What if I told you about my little nothing town\r\nThe two room house where I came from\r\nThe man that I got my name from\r\nI don't even know where he is now\r\nWhat if I told you sometimes I lose my faith\n\nI wonder why someone like you would even talk to me\n\nWhat if I told you there is no fixing me\n\nCause everybody has already tried\n\n\n\nWould you stay?\n\nWould you leave?\n\nI could wait\n\nIt'll all come out eventually\n\n\n\nIf I told you all the stupid things I've done\n\nI've blamed on being young\n\nBut I was old enough to know I know\n\nIf I told you the mess that I can be\n\nWhen there's no one there to see\n\nCould you look the other way?\n\nCould you love me anyway?\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you I don't plan on staying here\n\nMy dreams are a million miles away\n\nAnd I know your family is gonna want you to stay\n\nYou know what I don't blame 'em\n\n\n\nSo I'll say\n\nWhat I don't want to\n\nAnd I'll just pray\n\nYou want what I do\n\n\n\nIf I told you all the stupid things I've done\n\nI've blamed on being young\n\nBut I was old enough to know I know\n\nIf I told you the mess that I can be\n\nWhen there's no one there to see\n\nCould you look the other way?\n\nCould you love me anyway?\n\nAww, could you love me anyway?\n\n\n\nSo before we go any further here\n\nLet a week turn into another year\n\nThere some things you probably don't wanna hear\n\nBut you have to\n\n\n\nIf I told you sometimes I get jealous\n\nSometimes I'm half crazy\n\nWould you say the hell with me, the hell with me\n\nIf I told you I barely know what love is\n\nBut girl if that's what this is\n\nI don't want to let it slip away\n\nNo, no, no\n\n\n\nCould you love me anyway?\n\nPlease\n\nCould you love me anyway?\n\nCould you love me anyway? (Oooooh)\n\nCould you love me anyway?"
