  "lyrics": "Woe to you, earth and sea\r\nWho may hold the lock and key\r\nLift from me infant smiles\r\nChase the sleep from my newborn eyes\r\nEyes with the light of true disciples\n\nTurn to behold your new way\n\nWhere will you go\n\nBeloved brother into the judgement day..?\n\n\n\nLamb of God, names divine\n\nRise but soon shall decline\n\nStars of old raise their spears\n\nCrack my shield, please my dears\n\n\n\nDark is the night that leads from heaven\n\nFloating on light - a true hell\n\nHear, can you hear a choir of angels\n\nBid you a last farewell...\n\n\n\nOh-ooooh\n\n(Oh-ooooh)"
