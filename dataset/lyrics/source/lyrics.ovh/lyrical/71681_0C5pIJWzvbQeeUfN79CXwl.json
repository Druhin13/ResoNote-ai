  "lyrics": "I fell in hole so deep\r\nI can't crawl out\r\nAnd your face was all that i saw\r\nI needed rescue and your love came down\r\nMy light when my shadow was dark\n\nThey say that love is hard to find\n\nBut I can’t agree you’re in my sights\n\nAnd I know my flaws might hurt your eyes\n\nI hope that i’m enough for you?\n\nMy pride can get the best of me\n\nBut there no other place I’d rather be\n\nThen right by your side for eternity\n\nGiving all my love to ya\n\n\n\nCause I will never find another like you in my life\n\nI've spent so many nights without you think I've lost my mind\n\nAnd baby girl you probably heard this twenty thousand times\n\nBut I will never find another like you in my life\n\n\n\nYou really something rare\n\nSo pardon if I stare\n\nYou've taken all that's left of me\n\nYou've given back my sanity\n\nYou want me to stay or you want me to leave?\n\nI'll show you my scars, if you throw me your keys\n\nThat opens your heart, you should know that I mean it\n\nI'm ready to die if it stops you from leaving\n\n\n\nThey say that love is hard to find\n\nBut I can’t agree you’re in my sights\n\nAnd I know my flaws might hurt your eyes\n\nI hope that i’m enough for you?\n\nMy pride can get the best of me\n\nBut there no other place I’d rather be\n\nThen right by your side for eternity\n\nGiving all my love to ya\n\n\n\nCause I will never find another like you in my life\n\nI've spent so many nights without you think I've lost my mind\n\nAnd baby girl you probably heard this twenty thousand times\n\nBut I will never find another like you in my life"
