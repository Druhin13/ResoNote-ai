  "lyrics": "Going to Seattle on the Greyhound\r\nI missed school for this\r\nBought two tickets last September\r\nBefore your harmful bliss\r\nPlayin' at the Neptune\n\nThey were your favourite\n\nI still can't believe you're gone\n\nCan't get you to explain it\n\n\n\nI wish I could go home, forget this ever happened\n\nI feel depressed, out of whack, and in my own world\n\nSometimes I can't feel a thing\n\nI can barely feel a thing\n\n\n\nHats off to you\n\nFor you to go\n\nWish you were here\n\nAt the show\n\n\n\n\n\nHats off to you\n\nFor you to go\n\nWish you were here\n\nBut now it blows\n\n\n\nIt ruled your world\n\nYou lost the battle\n\nIt broke my heart in half\n\nWhen I heard the bottles rattle\n\n\n\nI know you wanted to be here\n\nBut now you're gone\n\nI'll be thinking of you\n\nWhen the lights come on\n\n\n\nHats off to you\n\nFor you to go\n\nWish you were here\n\nBut now it blows"
