  "lyrics": "It became crystal clear when you broke down in tears\r\nSaying “it was once I swear in a game of truth and dare”\r\nWell you should go, because darling I don’t want to know\r\nA run down of the script like the scene he kissed your candy lips\r\nYou take take and break break\n\nYou’ve got a good eye for the bad guys\n\nIt’s come to light that I’m a game\n\nA game you like to play\n\n\n\nI cross my heart and I hope to die\n\nYour pretty eyes made a good disguise\n\nAnd if I could rewind the days I’d be the one who got away\n\n\n\nYou’re delusional, you’re borderline criminal\n\nThe prisoner & thief robbed me of my dignity\n\n\n\nYou take take and break break\n\nYou’ve got a good eye for the bad guys\n\nIt’s come to light that I’m a game\n\nA game you like to play\n\n\n\nI cross my heart and I hope to die\n\nYour pretty eyes made a good disguise\n\nAnd if I could rewind the days I’d be the one who got away\n\nBittersweetheart here’s the bottom line\n\nYour pretty little lies ain’t no surprise\n\nAnd if I could rewind the days I’d be the one who got away\n\n\n\nBut I still sleep with demons\n\nThey’re running through my brain\n\nTelling me that I’m to blame\n\nYou said, oh girl you promised\n\nThat you wouldn’t be the same\n\nBut I’d be lying if I told you I’m okay\n\n\n\n(does he hold your hand to keep you safe?\n\nDoes he keep you up for midnight talking?\n\nWell I’m not losing sleep but I’d be lying if I told you I’m okay)\n\n\n\nI cross my heart and I hope to die\n\nYour pretty eyes made a good disguise\n\nAnd if I could rewind the days I’d be the one who got away\n\nBittersweetheart here’s the bottom line\n\nYour pretty little lies made no surprise\n\nAnd if I could rewind the days I’d be the one who got away\n\n\n\n(tell me how it feels, how does it feel when you’re dead to me?)"
