  "lyrics": "Stuck in traffic on my way\r\nTo no particular place\r\nNo agenda, no master plan\r\nNo important dates\r\nNo reason to be alive at all\n\nAs far as I can tell\n\nExcept for one small detail\n\nLike a distant ringing bell\n\n\n\nAnd it keeps on calling out to me\n\nLike a lost forgotten lover\n\nSo I blast off down the shoulder\n\nTo go looking for the other\n\n\n\nDriving up the coast\n\nPast the surfers and the seals\n\nAll them lonely rich folks\n\nWho only know how to steal\n\n\n\nScience can cure sickness\n\nBut what can cure my soul\n\nIt won't be long before I'm gone\n\nLaying in some hole\n\n\n\nSo I find an ancient payphone\n\nTo tell my mother I love her\n\nBut she ain't home\n\nShe must have gone out looking for the other\n\n\n\nPull up off the highway\n\nThe moon is looking wicked good\n\nI throw my keys into the breeze\n\nAnd get lost in the woods\n\n\n\nI think about my old man\n\nAnd the mystery of time\n\nWhen suddenly between the trees\n\nI see the lake of fire\n\n\n\nSo I jump right in\n\nAnd take a swim\n\nIn this pool of unknown colours\n\nAnd as I swim I begin to brim with visions of the other\n\n\n\nFound my car a few days later\n\nAfter I came to\n\nHer name was Blue Subaru 1982\n\n\n\nI punched the clutch\n\nAnd kick the gas\n\nAnd take off in a burst\n\nWell it wasn't long before the gas was gone\n\nAnd we were overcome from thirst\n\n\n\nSo we found a dusty truckstop\n\nAbove the vultures hovered\n\nAnd I thought it was the end\n\nBut then I thought again\n\nAnd that was when I took the hand of the other"
