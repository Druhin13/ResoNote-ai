  "lyrics": "Oh you make it look so easy\r\nYour love came freely\r\nShe had her chances\r\nCould leave it in the past there\r\nShe took advantage\r\nShe’s taking it for granted\n\nYou know I try so hard\n\nBut I don't understand it\n\n\n\nShe loves to say “I’m free\"\n\nLet it be\n\nWell if you change your mind about me\n\n\n\n'Cause you look so sweet in the heat of summer\n\nYou drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander\n\nYou’re lonely honey, can’t you see what I see\n\nIf you love me baby you’ve gotta set it free\n\n\n\nYou’re looking that way, I just can’t stand it\n\nI learned my lesson but you break it like a habit\n\nOh, you can run from me baby but you won’t get far\n\nEvery time I close my eyes she will kiss me in the dark\n\n\n\nBut if you say you’re gone\n\nLet it be\n\nWell if you change your mind about me\n\n\n\n‘Cause you look so sweet in the heat of summer\n\nYou drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander\n\nYou’re lonely honey, can’t you see what I see\n\nIf you love me baby you’ve gotta set it free\n\n\n\nYou look so sweet in the heat of summer\n\nYou drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander\n\nYou’re lonely honey, can’t you see what I see\n\nIf you love me baby you’ve gotta set it free\n\n\n\n'Cause you look so sweet in the heat of summer\n\nYou drive me crazy me when your hands start to wander\n\nYou’re lonely honey, can’t you see what I see\n\nIf you love me baby you’ve gotta set it free\n\nIf you love me baby you’ve gotta set it free"
