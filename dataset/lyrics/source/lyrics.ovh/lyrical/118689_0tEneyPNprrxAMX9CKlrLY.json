  "lyrics": "I might die tonight, but if I do Imma be okay\r\nAnd if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said\r\nI got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motha fucker standing in my way\r\nAnd if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away!\r\nSix foot deep, deep deep in the cut\n\nShovel and a tarp rolled up in the truck\n\nCouple old bikers and they know whats up\n\nSpin my iTunes, shake em, I'm getting people roughed up\n\nAnd a child molester might end up in the mud\n\nBones in the shit of a couple wild boars\n\nTeeth buried in the lot of a little white church\n\nI be somewhere dog GPS don’t work\n\nWhen the cops all do things a little bit dirty\n\nBut they stay on my team, I got that baby face money\n\nYa’ll can buy all that jewelry, I’ll invest in my community\n\nWhen we both go into the ground, fill it up with plenty shiny things\n\nI got brass for days, pitbulls with teeth so razor sharp you’d think\n\nMy females slept with a great white shark\n\nI ain’t tryna brag but my A-Team too big\n\nSome crazy mother fuckers on that 1900’s shit\n\nIt’s time for a change, ya I came with some buddies\n\nWho don’t mind getting muddy and bloody and standing for something\n\nAnd putting some sense into this corrupt country\n\nGo ahead big dog come over here and say something\n\n\n\nI might die tonight, but if I do Imma be okay\n\nAnd if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said\n\nI got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motha fucker standing in my way\n\nAnd if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away!\n\n\n\nYou can get it, Imma fight until the death of me\n\nI ain’t never been on the run from an enemy\n\nHeavily armed to the teeth, got an army with me\n\nAnd I’m ready to die if you threaten me\n\nAK’s, AR’s, you ain’t who you say you are\n\nBullets start flying, putting ghosts in the graveyard\n\nFull moon lighting up the battlefield\n\nBattle to my last breath and my blood splatter here\n\nJust breathe a minute\n\nJust think a minute\n\nYou don’t wanna go to war\n\nOr we could get it, yeah we could bring it right to your front door\n\nI don’t think you wanna go that route\n\nI ain’t known to fuck around, fuck around\n\nImma throw a hundred rounds\n\nPut your cold body in the fuckin' ground\n\nGet the point bitch, when I hit you with the hollow round\n\nWhat the fuck you talkin' bout\n\nI don’t wanna talk about it\n\nLeave your body right there layin' with some chalk around it\n\nWhy I gotta go so hard\n\nWhy you so fuckin' soft\n\nCall your man runnin' bitch, you already fuckin' lost\n\n\n\nI might die tonight, but if I do Imma be okay\n\nAnd if I die tonight, at least I stood by the stuff I said\n\nI got two graves dug, one for me and one for the motha fucker standing in my way\n\nAnd if I die tonight, at least I can say I never ran away!"
