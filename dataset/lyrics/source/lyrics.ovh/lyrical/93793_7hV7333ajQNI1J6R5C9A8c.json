  "lyrics": "I want you to want me like you want a beer\r\nWhen it's hot in the middle of June\r\nAnd I wanna be like your morning coffee\r\nAlways the first thing you do\r\nBaby, I know what you're thinking\r\nBefore the words even come out of your mouth\n\nWhen I look at you I forget what the hell we were talking about\n\n\n\nAnd I don't deserve you, I'll never hurt you\n\nIf I ever lost you, I'd die\n\nIf I couldn't hold you, I would be so blue\n\nAnd I'm not supposed to cry\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm saying it too early, maybe I'm moving fast\n\nI may not be the first to love you, but I wanna be the last\n\nWhen you know, then you know, and I can't let a good thing go\n\nI know I'm rough around the edges, not as smooth as the rest\n\nBut I can promise you, when I'm with you, I'll love you the best\n\nWhen you know, then you know, and we can't let a good thing go\n\n\n\nThe way that you throw on your makeup\n\nAnd stare at the mirror's a beautiful thing\n\nThe way that you take up my side of the bed\n\nEven though we have a king\n\nAll your family thinks you're too good for me and I can't defend\n\nI'm just so happy that you would agree to be more than a friend\n\n\n\nAnd I don't deserve you, I'll never hurt you\n\nIf I ever lost you, I'd die\n\nIf I couldn't hold you, I would be so blue\n\nAnd I'm not supposed to cry\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm saying it too early, maybe I'm moving fast\n\nI may not be the first to love you, but I wanna be the last\n\nWhen you know, then you know, and I can't let a good thing go\n\nI know I'm rough around the edges, not as smooth as the rest\n\nBut I can promise you, when I'm with you, I'll love you the best\n\nWhen you know, then you know, and we can't let a good thing go\n\n\n\nWe can't let a good thing go\n\nSo let's just let this good thing grow\n\nI can't let a good thing go, oh\n\nWe can't let a good thing go\n\nSo let's just let keep this good thing growing\n\nAnd I can't let a good thing go, oh, oh\n\nAnd I can't let a good thing go\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm saying it too early, maybe I'm moving fast\n\nI may not be the first to love you, but I wanna be the last\n\nWhen you know, then you know, and I can't let a good thing go\n\n(So let's just keep this good thing growing)\n\nI know I'm rough around the edges, not as smooth as the rest\n\nBut I can promise you, when I'm with you, I'll love you the best\n\nWhen you know, then you know, and we can't let a good thing go"
