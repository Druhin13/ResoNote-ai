  "lyrics": "One for the flavor, one for motion\nOne for the Godless vagabond child\nOne for the things that have no solution\nOne for those who blew my mind\nOne for the loose girls, one for salvation\nOne for just nothing, and one just because\n\nOne for the preachers, one for damnation\n\nHey Mister, that's the way it goes\n\nLet's do the tango with the barfly's Lady\n\nThis bartime may be wrong\n\nOne for the moments of mixed up emotions\n\nOne for the hard times that don't get me down\n\nDrowned in my motions, potion by potion\n\nI drink a toast to anything now\n\nOne for tomorrow and one for today\n\nOne for wishy-washy anniversaries\n\nSomebody's always havin' a birthday\n\nSo one for them and one for just me"
