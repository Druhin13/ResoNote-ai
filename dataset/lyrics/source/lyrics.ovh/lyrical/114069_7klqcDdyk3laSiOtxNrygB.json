(Where are you, Christmas?)\n\nDo you remember (Do you remember)\n\nThe one you used to know?\n\nI'm not the same one\n\nSee what the time has done\n\nIs that why you have let me go? (Woah)\n\n\n\nChristmas is here\n\nEverywhere, oh\n\nChristmas is here\n\nIf you care, oh\n\nIf there is love in your heart and your mind (In your heart and mind)\n\nYou will feel like Christmas all the time (Oh)\n\n\n\nI feel you, Christmas (I feel you, Christmas)\n\nI know I’ve found you\n\nYou never fade away (Fade away)\n\nWhere are you, Christmas?\n\nWhy can't I find you?\n\nWhy have you gone away?"
