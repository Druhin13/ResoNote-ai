  "lyrics": "I can get real fucked up\r\nBy myself in my own hell\r\nWatch as I chuck and chug\r\nImpurities, insecurities\r\nI wake up in a room filled with smoke\n\nSmells like you\n\nYeah, you took my storybooks\n\nIn your stride\n\n\n\nIt wasn't always this plain\n\nTo see my baggage\n\nYour love was savage\n\nSo I open a new way\n\nInto his bedroom\n\nI guess he's not you\n\n\n\nI wake up in a room\n\nWith someone I don't love\n\nMorning burns\n\nIn the light of day\n\nTruth can hide\n\n\n\nStranger, take me home\n\nIt's strange being on my own\n\nOh no\n\nStrange, hold me close\n\nStranger, I feel so alone\n\n\n\nCalled you up yesterday\n\nIntoxicated, old memories fading\n\nOh, you're in Hawaii\n\nI was supposed to be there with you\n\n\n\nI wake up in a state\n\nYou're not in\n\nWhat the fuck?\n\nI'll call him\n\nWhile my lonely heart\n\nCan not cry no, no\n\n\n\nStranger, take me home\n\nIt's strange being on my own, own\n\nStranger, hold me close\n\nStranger, I feel so alone, oh"
