  "lyrics": "Don't breath, don't look down, don't cry\r\nDon't waste your words and your time asking why\r\nI can feel it in your touch\r\nWhat will become of us?\r\nFeel the grass, hear the breeze, feel the doom\n\nWatch the sun come up on me and you\n\nIs this the last goodbye in love?\n\nWhat will become of us?\n\n\n\nI would run to you if you walk with me\n\nI would hear you out if your heart will speak\n\nI would die for you if you live with me\n\nWhat will become of us?\n\n\n\nKiss me slow, drag it out, make it last\n\nGive me something I don't have to give you back\n\nPretend we're the way it was\n\nWhat will become of us?\n\n\n\nI would run to you if you walk with me\n\nI would hear you out if your heart will speak\n\nI would die for you if you live with me\n\nWhat will become of us?\n\n\n\nIt's a lonely fall, it's sink or swim\n\nCan't see the wrongs but will dive it in\n\nI'll turn my head, while you twist your knife, turn the water red\n\n\n\nDon't breath, don't look down, don't cry\n\nI'll look you through the river in your eyes\n\nThis is the last goodbye in lust and love\n\nWhat will become of us\n\nWhat will become of us"
