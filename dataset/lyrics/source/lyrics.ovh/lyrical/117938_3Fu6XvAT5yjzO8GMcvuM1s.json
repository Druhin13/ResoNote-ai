  "lyrics": "We're rocking around the Christmas Tree\r\nAt the Christmas party hop\r\nMistletoe hung where you can see\r\nEv'ry couple tries to stop\r\nRocking around the Christmas Tree\n\nLet the Christmas Spirit ring\n\nLater we'll have some pumpkin pie\n\nAnd we'll do some caroling\n\n\n\nYou will get a sentimental feeling when you hear voices singing\n\n\"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly\"\n\nRocking around the Christmas Tree\n\nHave a happy holiday (A happy holiday)\n\nEveryone's dancing merrily\n\nIn a new old fashioned way\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will get a sentimental feeling When you hear voices singing\n\n\"Let's be jolly; Deck the halls with boughs of holly\"\n\nRocking around the Christmas Tree\n\nHave a happy holiday (A happy holiday)\n\nEveryone's dancing merrily\n\nIn a new old fashioned way"
