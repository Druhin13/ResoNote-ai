  "lyrics": "How was I to know that this was always \nOnly just a little gama to you? \nAll the time I felt you gave your heart \nI thought that I would do the same for you \nTell the truth, I think I should have \n\nSeen it coming from a mile away \n\nWhen the world you say are \n\nBaby, I'm a fool who thinks \n\nIt's cool to fall in love \n\n\n\nIf I gave a thought to fascination \n\nI would know it wasn't right to care \n\nLogic doesn't seem to mind that \n\nI am fascinated by your love affair \n\n\n\nStill my heart would benefit from \n\nA little tenderness from time to time but never mind \n\n'Cause, baby, I'm a fool \n\nWho thinks it's cool to fall in love \n\n\n\nBaby, I should hold on just a moment \n\nAnd be sure it's not for vanity \n\nLook me in the eye and tell me \n\nLove is never based upon insanity \n\n\n\nEven when my heart is beating \n\n\n\nHurry up the moment's fleeting \n\nKiss me now, don't ask me how \n\n\n\n'Cause,baby, I'm a fool \n\nWho thinks it's cool to fall \n\nBaby, I'm a fool \n\nWho thinks it's cool to fall \n\nAnd I would never tell if you became a fool \n\nAnd fell in love"
