  "lyrics": "On a cold and windy morning, said goodbye to my old friends\r\nThey were hangin' around the corner,\r\nThey were stayin' till the end\r\nOn the other side of midnight,\r\nI was lookin' for a place to stay\n\nAnd one thing's sure for certain,\n\nI ain't never goin' back again\n\n\n\nThe streetlights looked so pretty as they spread into a town\n\nI was lookin' for another sundown\n\nAnd my head was spinning round and round\n\n\n\nChorus: Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger\n\nLookin' through the eyes of danger\n\nLookin' at the all-night dancer\n\nNever takin' all the chances\n\n\n\nAs I walked into the main street, saw a crowd across the square\n\nAnd I heard a guitar playin' and I saw you standing there\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nDistant bells they started ringing, somewhere far off in the night\n\nAnd the place was full of loneliness that disappeared from sight"
