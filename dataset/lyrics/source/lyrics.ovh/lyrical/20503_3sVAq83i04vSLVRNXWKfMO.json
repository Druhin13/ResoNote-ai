  "lyrics": "(Graham Russell)\r\nThis is the time when you need a friend\r\nYou just need someone near\r\nI'm not looking forward to the night I will spend\r\nThinking of you when you're not here\n\nHow many times will I think about the things\n\nI'd like to do\n\nAlways denied the right to live my life the way I want\n\nI want to share it with you\n\n\n\nClose your eyes I want to ride the skies\n\nIn my sweet dreams\n\nClose your eyes I want to see you tonight\n\nIn my sweet dreams\n\n\n\nI'll think of your kiss as the days roll by\n\nAnd I'll write the words you love\n\nAnd what I can't say in a letter\n\nWill just have to wait till I get home\n\n\n\nOoh there's not much time to tell you half the things I should\n\nOnly that I'm so glad I fell in love with you\n\nAnd I'd do it again if I could\n\n\n\nClose your eyes I want to ride the skies\n\nIn my sweet dreams\n\nClose your eyes I want to see you tonight\n\nIn my sweet dreams\n\n[2x]\n\n\n\nSleep like a child resting deep\n\nYou don't know what you give me I keep\n\nFor these moments alone\n\n\n\nClose your eyes I want to ride the skies\n\nIn my sweet dreams\n\nClose your eyes I want to see you tonight\n\nIn my sweet dreams"
