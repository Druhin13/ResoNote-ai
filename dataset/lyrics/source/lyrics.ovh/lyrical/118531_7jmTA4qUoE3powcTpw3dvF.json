  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\nCheck\r\nHow else I make it this far?\r\nHow else I make it this far?\r\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\n\n\nListen, music my flesh and blood, it's been my only love since ye high\n\nI used to play Jay high and Ye high\n\nThinkin' one day I would go from fan to fuckin' player\n\nI guess I found a way huh, my nigga Cozz wants Zendaya\n\nA side note, I'm rootin' for you, I use these bars and start recruitin' for you\n\nBut treat her right\n\nAnd just remember, on your lonely nights this mic will be your friend\n\nYou tell it all your secrets that you keepin' deep within\n\nYour fantasies, regrets, your happy moments and your sins\n\nAnd if he doesn't comprehend, at least he can pretend\n\nLet's begin to be the men we never seen\n\nIn the 80's they smoke crack but now today they sippin' lean\n\nAnd poppin' Xannies\n\nFuck niggas runnin' from their families\n\nThe streets don't give a fuck about the Grammys\n\nWish I could talk to granny, wish I could smoke in peace\n\nBut when I hit the blunt lately my mind it tortures me\n\nEverything ain't supposed to be, apparently\n\nI take it as a sign and stick the shit that's steerin' me\n\nIn the direction of some clarity\n\nThis music is my therapy, I thank the Lord 'cause he care for me\n\n\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nYou know I gotta thank God\n\nHow else I make it this far? (far)\n\n\n\nMusic is my soul and fuel\n\nI guess it only saves a chosen few\n\nFrom goin' to school or sellin' dope, crazy\n\nBack in school, I was bumpin' Cole daily\n\nNow I'm writin' rhymes in the notebook that Cole gave me\n\nAnd bro you so crazy, but all I can do is thank you\n\nYou threw your boy a lob, and shit, I ain't even say to\n\nBut fuck it, all that shit he stay true\n\n'Cause you a dime, I'm sure you hear that every day, cool\n\nSo look, fuck bein' fine 'cause I know you got a brain too\n\nAnd shit, let me not get my plate full, you know your brain moves\n\nA little different when you haven't ate food\n\nSo I'ma leave it up to fate to make these decisions\n\nAnd stick to my intentions\n\nI did it for more of the passion, not the great checks\n\nKnowin' that there's more than fat asses and great sex\n\nTryna be the man I ain't yet\n\nBut demons stuck on me like ashes on gray sweats\n\n'Cause man I ain't made shit and I'm lackin' the patience\n\nIt's a battle to take in' the fact that I ain't win, yet\n\nWhat am I sayin', I can't go play and win\n\nI travel and take trips, I look to God then I thank Him\n\n\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nYeah, how else I make it this far?\n\nHow else I make it this far?\n\nYou know I gotta thank God\n\nHow else I make it this far? (far)\n\n\n\nLook, I ain't got money to blow but I'm gettin' there, dawg\n\nCan't get momma a home but I'm gettin' there y'all\n\nWon't reach the end of the road, just sittin' there dawg\n\nHow you gon' learn to grow if you ain't listenin' y'all?\n\nLook, I'm still a student of the game but I been through some things\n\nAnd I could school you rather say don't be clueless in the brain\n\nYou gotta learn to fly before you cruisin' with the planes\n\nAnd you could be a boss, just gotta do it in your lane\n\nChoosin' and choose to pray instead of choosin' to pray\n\nTo use and abuse for pay\n\nYou doin' it for the love or you doin' it to get praised?\n\nWhat would you do for fame?\n\nIf it was family or money, they probably lose you today\n\nProbably go buy a car and try and coupe with the pain\n\nSometimes homies and hoes is truly the same\n\nTry and screw you for change, yeah it's truly a shame\n\nBut somehow I seem to see the beauty in the rain\n\nI made it this far"
