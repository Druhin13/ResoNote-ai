  "lyrics": "I took a drive today\r\nSaw an old willow tree\r\nI thought about a bedroom window\r\nThought about you and me\r\nYeah, talk about an endless summer\r\nI'm still living it now\n\nBurning in the heat of midnight\n\nI'll never forget how\n\n\n\nYou would whisper\n\nPull me to ya\n\nSoftly kiss me and\n\nHallelujah\n\nI told you that I loved you\n\nAnd watched the tears fall down your face\n\nYour sweet face\n\nBack in the days when\n\nYou were amazing grace\n\n\n\nYour daddy was a deacon at the church\n\nI wasn't fooling him\n\nHe knew every book, chapter and verse\n\nOf a young man's sins\n\nBut what about those nights I was just down the hall\n\nHoldin on to heaven\n\nPraying that we wouldn't get caught so\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nOh how sweet the sound when...\n\nChorus"
