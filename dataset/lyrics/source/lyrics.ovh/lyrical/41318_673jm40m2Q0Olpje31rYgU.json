  "title": "Hearing the Bass",
  "lyrics": "Want to wander, to watch\r\nTo weather, to whisper too\r\nTo whimper, to win, to win\r\nSwell to swallow to switch\r\nTo swim to swan too\r\nTo swing, to sing, to sting\n\nTo storm, to torn\n\n\n\nTo telling few for a five minute clue\n\nFew selling two new blue suede shoes\n\nPew pulling tooth from rotten gum root\n\nSue sulking solo in giant conduit\n\nCrew seeks to fill, an open seat on the team\n\nBlue plays the scale, like the man of your dreams\n\n\n\nHearing the bass as you enter your teens\n\nExit your life like a lightning universal theme"
