  "lyrics": "From way up high, straight down to the bottom\r\nSome folks get loud, some get forgotten\r\nWhen you're so high the sun won't shine\r\nShine a light for the search of my [?]\r\nEvery little thing's gonna be all right\n\nDid everything you can to get it off your mind\n\nI need a reason, need something new to believe in now\n\nI want to love, can you show me?\n\nEverything you do to resolve your mind\n\nDid everything you can Lord, to make it right\n\nI got a reason, got something new to believe in now\n\nI killed the pain, dancing in the rain\n\n\n\nA broken man is a ticking time-bomb\n\nA broken heart is a full-blown cyclone\n\nBack and forth, you're south now north\n\nTake me back to how it was before\n\n\n\nEvery little thing's gonna be all right\n\nDid everything you can to get it off your mind\n\nI got a reason, got something new to believe in now\n\nI want to love, can you show me?\n\nEverything you do to resolve your mind\n\nDid everything you can Lord, to make it right\n\nI got a reason, got something new to believe in now\n\nI killed the pain, dancing in the rain\n\n\n\nEvery little thing is gonna be all right\n\nDid everything you can to get it off your mind\n\nI need a reason, need something new to believe in now\n\nI wanna love\n\n\n\nEvery little thing is gonna be all right (I wanna love)\n\nDid everything you can to get it off your mind\n\nI need a reason, need something new to believe in now\n\nI wanna love, can you show me?\n\nEverything you do to resolve your mind\n\nDid everything you can Lord, to make it right\n\nI got a reason, got something new to believe in now\n\nKilled the pain, dancing in the rain"
