  "lyrics": "I know the bible isn't perfect 'cause it left one person out\r\nThere was Adam, there was Eve, and there was someone else around\r\nYeah I think his name was Steve and he was passin' through town\r\nWhen he heard a snake whisperin' to Adam in the garden\r\n\"Take the fruit, it's good for you\" Steve said, \"I beg your pardon\"\r\nI know it's not my business, but will you just hear me out?\n\n\n\nHe said, \"I wouldn't lie, you should not go to that tree\n\nThe serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed\n\nOh, you want what you can't have but you've got all the things you need\n\nThere was Adam, there was Eve and there was Steve\"\n\n\n\nHe said, \"Adam, don't be fooled by the snake\n\nDon't risk it all for a taste, oh what a waste\n\nTo have everything and give it all away\"\n\n\n\nAdam looked around and as he wrestled with his fate\n\nSteve and Eve rolled up their sleeves to wrestle with that snake\n\nIn the midst of all the chaos, Steve was still screamin' out\n\n\n\nHe said, \"I wouldn't lie, you should not go to that tree\n\nThe serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed\n\nOh, you want what you can't have but you've got all the things you need\n\nThere was Adam, there was Eve and there was Steve\"\n\n\n\nHe said, \"Adam, don't be fooled by the snake\n\nDon't risk it all for a taste, oh what a waste\n\nTo have everything and give it all away\"\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel like Adam 'cause I've got more than I need\n\nBut even when I have it all I want what's out of reach\n\nMaybe I should learn my lesson like Steve was talkin' to me\n\n\n\nHe said, \"I wouldn't lie, you should not go to that tree\n\nThe serpent knows the apple grows from a forbidden seed\n\nOh, you want what you can't have but you've got all the things you need\n\nThere was Adam, there was Eve and there was Steve\"\n\n\n\nHe said, \"Adam, don't be fooled by the snake\n\nDon't risk it all for a taste, oh what a waste\n\nTo have everything and give it all away\""
