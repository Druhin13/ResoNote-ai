  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Visions of China par The Lumineers\r\nTwisty sidewalks, female taxi drivers\nDirty fingers, pink houses light up\n\nAnd if there's just one thing\nYou wanted to see\nI suggest you keep looking\n\nFind out for once\nFind out for once\nFind out for once\n\nCount the bikes, Strange violin\nBarter price, smoking inside\nStray cat walks, broken English\nChairman's eye, living billions\n\n\nAnd if there's just one thing\nYou wanted to see\nI suggest you keep looking\n\nFind out for once\nFind out for once\nFind out for once"
