  "lyrics": "You tore the ground in two\r\nAnd limped away\r\nYou couldn't say\r\nAnd what on earth to do\r\nI come for blood\r\nIt came up none upon the leaf\n\n\n\nI'm in, I'm out, underground\n\nI found a crown all buried down\n\nUnderneath, you know I don't believe you\n\nWhen you say those words, I can't do it\n\n\n\nFrom every point of view\n\nIt all adds up\n\nAnd I won't let up\n\nI wanna start anew\n\nI'm running the hard way\n\n\n\nAll we need is a hundred acres\n\nAnd a row of seed\n\nAll we need is a hundred acres\n\nAnd some room to breathe\n\n\n\nI'm in, I'm out, underground\n\nI found a crown all buried down\n\nUnderneath, you know I don't believe you\n\nWhen you say those words, I can't do it\n\n\n\nNo, I can't... I can't do it\n\nI can't do it, I can't do it\n\nNo, I can't... I can't do it\n\nI can't do it"
