  "lyrics": "Woke up in a daze got me feeling so strange\r\nWe so damn far from that honeymoon phase\r\nTaught you how to love, taught you how to be brave\r\nThen you had to try and throw it all in my face\r\nYou said that I'd need you\n\nYou said that I'd miss you\n\nBut you're just a chapter that I know I'll forget\n\n'Cause you are just all talk\n\nThe truth is you're so lost\n\nIf we had it all then you've got nothing left\n\n\n\nI've forgotten how to love because of you\n\nI know that I'll be ok\n\nOh you were my big mistake\n\nI-I-I got stuck in limbo 'cause of you\n\nI know that I'll be ok\n\nOh you were my big, my big mistake\n\n\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\n\n\nYou were spending hours at the place where we met\n\nThinking someone else would make you feel like I did\n\nAnd all your little posts tryna make me regret\n\nThey're just a distraction till you call me again\n\n\n\nYou said that I'd need you\n\nYou said that I'd miss you\n\nBut you're just a chapter that I know I'll forget\n\n'Cause you are just all talk\n\nThe truth is you're so lost\n\nIf we had it all then you've got nothing left\n\n\n\nI've forgotten how to love because of you\n\nI know that I'll be ok\n\nOh you were my big mistake\n\nI-I-I got stuck in limbo 'cause of you\n\nI know that I'll be ok\n\nOh you were my big, my big mistake\n\n\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\n\n\nOne day you gon' wake up\n\nMissing something you can't replace, yeah\n\nYou gon' try to make up\n\nBut sorry's just a little too late\n\n\n\nOh you were my big-\n\n\n\nI've forgotten how to love because of you\n\nI know that I'll be ok\n\nOh you were my big mistake (my big mistake)\n\nI-I-I got stuck in limbo 'cause of you (oh)\n\nI know that I'll be ok\n\nOh you were my big, my big mistake\n\n\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake (my big mistake)\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake (my big mistake)\n\nYou were my, you were my, you were my big mistake"
