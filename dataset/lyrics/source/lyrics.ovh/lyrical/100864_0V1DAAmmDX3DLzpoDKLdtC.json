  "lyrics": "Buongiorno! That's hello in Spanish. I'm Danny Sexbang and I'd like to welcome you to Ninja Sex Party's sixth album, Cool Patrol. Can you believe it's been six albums already? Why, it seems like only yesterday that I single-handedly started this two person band all by myself! And definitely not with Ninja Brian, whoever that is. And now we have four original albums and two cover albums to our name. With all this stuff under our belt, it seems that we've really come far. Indeed, we've come farther and faster than anyone could've expected us to come. Shooting our luscious jams all over your body, year after year after year. And no matter how hard you try to wipe those last remaining notes off your perky-. You know what, I need to be alone for a minute. So please enjoy Cool Patrol\r\nOH GOD!"
