  "lyrics": "I took a little breather of my own\r\nI might be too far-gone\r\nLittle fragments of my life\r\nI'm slowly dying\r\nTrying not to be so far from home\r\nBut will I be there alone\n\nFragile pieces of my mind\n\nI'm feeling paralyzed\n\nCompromised\n\n\n\nSo let it out, let it go\n\nJust spit it out straight till I'm not breathing\n\nLet it out, take it whole\n\nJust let it, I'll find a way to be\n\n\n\nSo let it out, let it go\n\nJust spit it out straight till I'm not breathing\n\nLet it out, take it whole\n\nJust let it, I'll find a way to be\n\nWay to be\n\n\n\nCritical decisions took too long\n\nMy promises are strong\n\nWatching loyalties divide\n\nSo I'm taking back my life\n\nGolden visions from now on\n\nCan't carry you along\n\nNo more explanations why\n\nI've erased and dramatized\n\nNeutralized\n\n\n\nSo let it out, let it go\n\nJust spit it out straight till I'm not breathing\n\nLet it out, take it whole\n\nJust let it, I'll find a way to be\n\n\n\nSo let it out, let it go\n\nJust spit it out straight till I'm not breathing\n\nLet it out, take it whole\n\nJust let it, I'll find a way to be\n\nA way to be\n\n\n\nSo let it all out, let it all go\n\nLet it out, let it all out\n\nSo let it all out, let it all go\n\nLet it out, let it all out\n\nSo let it all out, let it all go\n\nLet it out, let it all out\n\nSo let it all out, let it all go\n\nLet it out, let it all out\n\nLet it out\n\n\n\nSo let it out, let it go\n\nJust spit it out straight till I'm not breathing\n\nLet it out, take it whole\n\nJust let it, I'll find a way to be\n\n\n\nSo let it out, let it go\n\nJust spit it out straight till I'm not breathing\n\nLet it out, take it whole\n\nJust let it, I'll find a way to be"
