Vera Ostrova)\r\nWhat if I...got right into \nMy mind's velocity\r\nWhat if I...finally discovered\r\nThe rules of Eternity\n\n\n\nWhat if I tell you \n\nWhat we live for...what we die for\n\nWhat if I tell you\n\nThat you will be born again\n\n\n\nWhat if I tell you \n\nWhat we live for...what we die for\n\nWhat if I tell you\n\nThat you will be born again...and you will do\n\nit all over agin\n\n\n\nWill you stop running? Will you stop hiding?\n\nand looking for material things\n\nWill you start searching...will you start seeking for\n\nyour immortal wings"
