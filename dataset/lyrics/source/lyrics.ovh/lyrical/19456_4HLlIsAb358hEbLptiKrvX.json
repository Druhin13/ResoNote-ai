  "lyrics": "We stopped\r\nFrom one day to the next\r\nIt was not\r\nNot the way we had planned\r\nIt was much too much too soon\n\nOh you dropped\n\nYou dropped me like a wet umbrella\n\nIt was not\n\nA very elegant move\n\nAnd I cried, oh yes I cried\n\n\n\nOoh you know it it's got to be true\n\nTrue affection, truth\n\nOoh you know it it's got to be you\n\nTruth affection, truth\n\n\n\nShortcuts!\n\nShortcuts that's what you were thinking\n\nI forgot\n\nI forgot we were friends\n\nAnd I laughed, I laughed so much I cried\n\n\n\nOoh you know it it's got to be true\n\nTruth affection, truth\n\nOoh you know it it's got to be you\n\nTrue affection, truth"
