  "lyrics": "She didn't pay admission\r\nSnuck in at intermission\r\nShe showed up with a vision on a motherfucking mission\r\nAlready high and sweaty like she been up in the kitchen\r\nLooking for some action, tryna build a coalition\r\nDancing with a passion, you know the position\n\nGrinding on my troops, tryna rile up my militia\n\nI can't turn her off after I switched on her ignition\n\nShe wants to add a friend, and I'm a gifted mathematician\n\n\n\nPassion, driven, passion, addict\n\nPassion, basement, passion, attic\n\nPassion, domestic, passion, abroad\n\nPassion, always, passion, god\n\n\n\nI have a passion for passions\n\nI come in hot I turn dragons to ashes\n\nIgnite the whole matchbook of matches\n\nI strike, and I don't close the cover or batten the hatches\n\nI look the world in her eyeballs\n\nI tell them my theories, my breakthroughs and the newest of my thoughts\n\nI don't wait for the ovation to conclude\n\nI find applause\n\nSound's perfect in the background when I talk, it's like\n\n\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your ear\n\nA sound witness system tweaking in your tweaking in your ear"
