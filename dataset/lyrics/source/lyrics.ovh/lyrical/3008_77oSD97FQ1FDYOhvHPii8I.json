  "lyrics": "I leave it on a bad note\r\nStarting another screaming match\r\nBring all of our issues back to life\r\nGoing down a bad road\r\nWhen you've got somewhere else to be\r\nI will take you down with me\n\n'Cause I'm always imagine the worst\n\nWhen you're out drinking with the guys\n\nI picture girls and girls and girls surrounding you\n\nAnd they'll be stupid enough to fall\n\n'Cause you're too easy on the eye\n\nSo when you're walking out the door\n\nI start with you\n\n\n\nI make you leave on a bad note\n\nThat way you'll be right back where you belong\n\nYeah, if you leave on a bad note\n\nI know that your conscience won't leave you alone\n\n\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you back in my arms\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\n\n\nI know when you get there\n\nYou'll get a drink and check your phone\n\nTell your friends it's nothing wrong, but I\n\nI know you'll be second guessing every word you said\n\nAnd if the couch will be your bed tonight\n\n\n\nI make you leave on a bad note\n\nThat way you'll be right back where you belong\n\nYeah, if you leave on a bad note\n\nI know that your conscious won't leave you alone\n\n\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you back in my arms\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\n\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you back in my arms\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\n\n\nI make you leave on a bad note\n\nYeah, if you leave on a bad note\n\nI know that your conscious won't leave you alone\n\n\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home\n\nGuilt trip you back in my arms\n\nGuilt trip you all the way home"
