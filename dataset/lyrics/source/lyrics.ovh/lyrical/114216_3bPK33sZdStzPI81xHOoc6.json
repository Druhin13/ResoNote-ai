I gave my all to you\n\nThere’s a kid that no ones knows about and me and you both know I am the father too\n\nThat means I am a part of you, you went and broke my heart in two\n\nThen stabbed me in the back and watched me bleed and pulled an audible\n\nFuck! How you think this gon' end?\n\nCause I been dealing with depression, social media attention\n\nThey expect me to be happy but I’m fucking depressed\n\nI swear I’m fucking depressed\n\nAll the money in the world don’t mean a thing if you can’t share it with somebody that you love and that you fucking respect (Dax)\n\nDo you know how it feels to be awake\n\nBut all you want to do is go back to sleep? (do you?)\n\nBecause reality is suffocating pushing on your chest so all you want to do is go and live your life in your dreams? (can you relate?)\n\nDo you know how it feels when the person that you love doesn’t love you back?\n\nWhen they say the right things but their actions are the opposite of everything they tell you everyday to relax? (I need help)\n\nBitch I would've killed for you!\n\nMan fuck all of this music shit I’d pass up on a deal for you!\n\nOther niggas tried to fuck, I swear I only saw the real in you!\n\nYou cheated twice and now I can’t deal with you!\n\nIt’s Dax\n\n\n\nDear God\n\nI ask that you give me the strength, to trust again\n\nPlease help me relieve this burden from my heart\n\nI know time heals all wounds and some just take longer than others\n\nSo I'm going to trust you with this process\n\nAmen\n\n\n\nEverybody put your hands up if you can relate\n\nWe all been there, this is for you"
