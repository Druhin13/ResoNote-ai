  "lyrics": "Hashtag \"no filter\"\r\nSaid a lot of stuff that I don't remember\r\nLord knows, I'm guilty\r\nOf a lot of sins that I don't wanna live with\r\nMama'd probably cut me off the family tree\r\nIf she heard half the stories people tellin' me\n\n\n\nOh s***, there's proof\n\nInsta's out there telling all my truth\n\nI can't lie so I own it\n\nBeen a rough week, so what? I deserve it\n\nSorry to the Uber guy that took me home\n\nIt's kinda sad but I'm kinda glad I'm waking up alone\n\n\n\nI started with one shot\n\nTo have a good time\n\nEverybody knows how easy one can turn into five\n\nDon't judge me, 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine\n\nAnd I only get one shot\n\nSo I take it one shot at a time\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nTake it one shot at a time\n\nHey\n\nOne shot at a time\n\n\n\nMess up, live and learn\n\nRepent and repeat, build the bridges and burn it\n\nNo shame, just secrets\n\nGot a lot of memories, not a lot of regrets\n\nEvery time I said I'd never do it again\n\nWas right before I headed out for one more spin\n\n\n\nI started with one shot\n\nTo have a good time\n\nEverybody knows how easy one can turn into five\n\nDon't judge me, 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine\n\nAnd I only get one shot\n\nSo I take it one shot at a time\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nTake it one shot at a time\n\nHey\n\nOne shot at a time\n\n\n\nI think my fear of missing out\n\nMakes me do the one thing I could do without\n\n\n\nIt starts with one shot\n\nTo have a good time\n\nEverybody knows how easy one can turn into five\n\nDon't judge me, 'cause it ain't nobody's life but mine\n\nAnd I only get one shot\n\nSo I take it one shot at a time\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nTake it one shot at a time\n\nOne shot at a time\n\n\n\nOne shot at a time\n\nOne shot at a time"
