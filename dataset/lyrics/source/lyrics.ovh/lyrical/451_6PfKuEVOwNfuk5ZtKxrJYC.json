  "lyrics": "I shouldn't choose to play your games\r\nWhat's more I lose all the same\r\nAnd I come to realise how\r\nI tell the truth, you haven't changed\r\nLook breaks the tank and you hold the key\r\nBut I swear it's true, I know it's all the same\n\n\n\nI saw you today\n\nHeart break on your face\n\nWon't someone remind me?\n\nDon't ever come back\n\nWhile my heart's still intact\n\nI'll hide 'til you find me\n\n\n\nI followed you into the dance\n\nThe place been reaped with bold cigarettes\n\nAnd I warned you girl that we're all the same\n\nTell me the truth one last time\n\nDid you feel my heart and ignore my cry?\n\nYou've got to know that it hurts me all the same\n\n\n\nI, don't know\n\n'Cause I got you on my mind\n\nYeah, I got you alright\n\n\n\nI saw you today\n\nHeart break on your face\n\nWon't someone remind me?\n\nDon't ever come back\n\nWhile my heart's still intact\n\nI'll hide 'till you find me"
