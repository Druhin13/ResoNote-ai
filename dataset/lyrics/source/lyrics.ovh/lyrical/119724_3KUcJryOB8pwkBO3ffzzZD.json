  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\nOoh-ooh-ooh\r\nOh, love\r\nI was standing on a mountaintop\r\nThe sunshine smiling on my face\n\nBreeze was taking me away\n\nIt was the perfect day, and everything changed\n\nAnd I lost my father suddenly\n\nCouldn't keep it together, my family\n\nAnd all my reckless ways caught up with me\n\nLike the tortoise and the hare\n\nI was sleepin' when I shouldn't be\n\n\n\nI come back to you, come back\n\nI come back to you\n\nI come back to you, come back\n\nI come back to you\n\n\n\nI testify, I pledge allegiance to you\n\nThis love inside, it makes me come back to you\n\nI testify, I pledge allegiance to you\n\nLive or die, I always come back to you\n\n\n\nI lost my job and it haunted me\n\nMe and my lady lost a pregnancy\n\nAnd at my lowest, it dawned on me\n\nI'd forgotten who I'm supposed to be\n\n\n\nI testify, I pledge allegiance to you\n\nThis love inside, it makes me come back to you\n\nI testify, I pledge allegiance to you\n\nLive or die, I always come back to you\n\n\n\nBroken free from the chains that binded me\n\nLike an angel with brand new wings\n\nI can be anything I wanna be\n\nI can love myself again\n\n\n\nOh, I come back to you\n\nI come back to you\n\nI come back to you, come back\n\nI come back to you\n\n\n\nI testify, I pledge allegiance to you\n\nThis love inside, it makes me come back to you\n\nI testify, I pledge allegiance to you\n\nLive or die, I always come back to you"
