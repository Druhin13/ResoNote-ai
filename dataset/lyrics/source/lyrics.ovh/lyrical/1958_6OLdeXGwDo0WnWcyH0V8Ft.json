  "lyrics": "While digesting Reader's Digest\r\nIn the back of a dirty book store,\r\nA plastic flag, with gum on the back,\r\nFell out on the floor.\r\nWell, I picked it up and I ran outside\r\nSlapped it on my window shield,\n\nAnd if I could see old Betsy Ross\n\nI'd tell her how good I feel.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nBut your flag decal won't get you\n\nInto Heaven any more.\n\nThey're already overcrowded\n\nFrom your dirty little war.\n\nNow Jesus don't like killin'\n\nNo matter what the reason's for,\n\nAnd your flag decal won't get you\n\nInto Heaven any more. \n\n\n\nWell, I went to the bank this morning\n\nAnd the cashier he said to me,\n\n\"If you join the Christmas club\n\nWe'll give you ten of them flags for free.\"\n\nWell, I didn't mess around a bit\n\nI took him up on what he said.\n\nAnd I stuck them stickers all over my car\n\nAnd one on my wife's forehead.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nWell, I got my window shield so filled\n\nWith flags I couldn't see.\n\nSo, I ran the car upside a curb\n\nAnd right into a tree.\n\nBy the time they got a doctor down\n\nI was already dead.\n\nAnd I'll never understand why the man\n\nStanding in the Pearly Gates said...\n\n\n\n\"But your flag decal won't get you\n\nInto Heaven any more.\n\nWe're already overcrowded\n\nFrom your dirty little war.\n\nNow Jesus don't like killin'\n\nNo matter what the reason's for,\n\nAnd your flag decal won't get you\n\nInto Heaven any more.\""
