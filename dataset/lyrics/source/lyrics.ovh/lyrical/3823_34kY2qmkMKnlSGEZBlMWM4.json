  "lyrics": "'Cause heaven is a place I know\r\nI tell myself I shouldn't go\r\nA place where we could live together\r\nPlaying with fire, but certain we live forever\r\nHeaven is a place like this\r\nFour walls to hide within\n\nA cold, cold world's medicine\n\nKnowing you won't have to sleep alone again\n\n\n\nI don't know when I started loving you\n\nNow it's all that I can I do\n\nHeaven is a place I know when I'm with you\n\n\n\n'Cause heaven is a place I know\n\nIt's nothing like the TV shows\n\nCool and (?), it rains it snows\n\nAnd all the lights turned down low\n\nYeah, heaven is a place like this\n\nAn assembly of broken things\n\nNever heard an angel sing\n\nWhere living doesn't feel like falling\n\n\n\nI don't know when I started loving you\n\nNow it's all that I can do\n\nHeaven is a place I know when I'm with you\n\n\n\nJust for moment\n\nThe briefest second\n\nParadise is just inside my reach\n\nIt's just for a moment\n\nFor the sweetest second\n\nIt's you and me\n\nIt's you and me\n\n\n\nI don't know when I started loving you\n\nNow it's all that I can do\n\nHeaven is a place I know when I'm with you"
