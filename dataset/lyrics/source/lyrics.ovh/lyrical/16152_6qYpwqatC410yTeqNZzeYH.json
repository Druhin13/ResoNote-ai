  "lyrics": "I don't thank God enough, I'm so ungrateful\r\nThat's my fault, for treating all these hoes like angels\r\nThat's my fault, this life ain't come with a manual\r\nThe love of your life will kill you faster than cancer\r\nMy scars, make me a star\r\nAll my scars, make me a star\n\nDaytrip took it to ten (hey!)\n\n\n\nMy stab wounds are tattoo on my body\n\nNow I dry my eyes with the money\n\nI don't want you, all of the sudden you love me\n\nI just wanna hit your walls, crash test dummy\n\nImpromptu family reunions when you not clubbing\n\nI'm going down if I give a dollar to every cousin\n\nLast time we met we bumped heads so hard it's a concussion\n\nI know you want something, it's always something\n\nPull up in an i8 like a full mil\n\nThe only Batmobile I ever had from Happy Meal\n\nWhen I lift the doors up that's an orange peel\n\nShe got an ass so fat it pop out a vacuum seal\n\nLike my neck with a tad of glitter, I am the pagaent winner\n\n(I consider lick it if she beautiful)\n\nAll this paper, might just jam up in her\n\n(I had to upgrade my usual)"
