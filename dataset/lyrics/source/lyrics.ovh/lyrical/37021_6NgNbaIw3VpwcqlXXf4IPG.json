  "lyrics": "Summertime and the livin's easy,\rFish are jumpin', and the cotton is high.\rOh yo' daddy's rich and yo' ma is good lookin',\rSo hush, little baby, don' yo' cry.\rOne of these mornin's you goin' to rise un singin',\rThen you'll spread yo' wings an' you'll take the sky.\rBut till that mornin', there's a-nothin' can harm you\rWith Daddy and Mammy standin' by."
