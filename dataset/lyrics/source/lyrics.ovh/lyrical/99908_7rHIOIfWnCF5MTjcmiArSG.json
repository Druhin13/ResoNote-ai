but\n\nI'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey\n\nIt's something funny, baby\n\n\n\nWhen I open my eyes, I wish to see you\n\nBut your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time\n\nWell I guess you're somewhere with your crew\n\nIsn't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue\n\nYou sit in your room and you listen to tunes\n\nAnd I'm feeling embarrassed, it's true\n\nYou out there in Paris with who?\n\nWhen I open my eyes (eyes), I wish to see you\n\nBut your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time\n\nWell I guess you're somewhere with your crew\n\nI'm at the SOHO House\n\nIf you wanna come through, there's a seat just for you\n\nMy prettiest secret, I hope that you keep it\n\nI'm blue as a piece of the moon and I know I'll be seeing you soon\n\n\n\nShe said \"Jaden, you are my soulmate\"\n\nYou only say that when you're lonely\n\nGirl, I'm suprised you even know me, ay\n\nI'm not gon' fuck, but we can kick it like we homies, ay\n\n'Cause we just homies, baby\n\n\n\n(Life is a puzzle)\n\nIt isn't picture perfect\n\nYou could miss perfection in it because it is subtle\n\nThe storm is coming and it's raining cats and dogs, stay away from all them puddles\n\nI'm keepin' it humble and noble\n\nI spit that radiation like I’m Chernobyl\n\nOn Indus Valley, man, I'm in the valley, crying myself to sleep on the sofa (When you're lonely)\n\nI told ya I'm more than the kid with a chauffeur\n\nWho don't know the life of a soldier, I'm older now\n\nThe world's a lot colder now\n\nThe MSFTS are stayin' up, I'm tryna hold it down\n\nThey stay attackin' us, I'ma just weep on my willow\n\nI look what they sayin', they playin' as I go to sleep on my pillow\n\nBut then when I open my eyes, I wish to see you\n\nBut your phone doesn't ring and you're gone all the time\n\nWell I guess you're somewhere with your crew\n\nThis ain't the first time, but the worst time, and I'm feeling so blue\n\nI'm at the SOHO House\n\nIf you wanna come through, got a seat just for you\n\nGirl, and whether you do, I ain't proud of you so\n\n\n\nCome here, mama, I know you want me\n\nFood from the soul, I know you're hungry\n\nGave you my two cents, ain't got money, but\n\nI'll take you somewhere fun and tell you something funny, hey\n\nIt's something funny, baby\n\n\n\nYou need to stand for something or else you'll fall for nothing\n\nGirl, this not my country, we all come from Africa\n\nNow we're up to something\n\nGirl, you're hella grumpy\n\nI think you're just hungry\n\nCause right now you're actin' up\n\nI don't think you want me\n\nYou just want my company\n\nWhile your man is—\n\nAll these girls who laugh at us\n\nGirl, you got me running\n\nFrom you, I want nothing\n\nCloudy days aren't sunny\n\n\n\nGirl, you make me wanna dance, dance, dance\n\nPut me in a trance, you never wanna hold hands\n\nBut I guess I just missed the chance\n\nMiss one text she gets pi—\n\n(Fuck this, not recording anymore...)\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel like a stone, sometimes I'm feelin' like\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a stone, sometimes I'm feelin' like\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a stone, sometimes I'm feelin' like\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a slave, sometimes I'm ridin' a wave\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a star\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, sometimes I feel like a\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, star\n\n(I'm rolling)\n\nSometimes I feel like a star, yeah\n\n\n\nSaying that we'll run away\n\nI doubt that we'll ever go\n\nI hope the sunset will stay\n\nWe've traveled too far from home\n\nSaying that we'll run away\n\nI doubt that we'll ever go\n\nI hope the sunset will stay\n\nWe've traveled too far from home\n\nSaying that we'll run away\n\nI really doubt that we'll go\n\nI hope the sunset will stay\n\nWe've traveled too far from home\n\nSaying that we'll run away\n\nI really doubt that we'll go\n\nI hope the sunset will stay\n\nWe've traveled too far from home\n\n\n\nI don't wanna die, I don't wanna live a lie\n\nI don't wanna know\n\nYou could be my bride, you could let me come inside\n\nYou could be my home\n\nI don't wanna die, I don't wanna fantasize\n\nI don't wanna go\n\nBut baby, you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets when I'm all alone\n\nBaby girl, you know I'm rollin'\n\nGet you without any clothes, I'm focused\n\nOur love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless\n\nI don't wanna die, I don't wanna fantasize\n\nI don't wanna know\n\nBut baby you could be the one I'm telling all my secrets when I'm all alone\n\nBaby girl, you know I'm rollin'\n\nGet you without any clothes, I'm focused\n\nOur love is drowning in the ocean, hopeless\n\nRollin', rollin'\n\nRollin', rollin'\n\nBaby girl, you got me rollin'\n\nDamn out of your control and\n\nI touch your body in the ocean\n\nThen you feel these raw emotions\n\n\n\nSyre\n\nPassion, Pain and Desire just like my big bro'\n\nWhat you didn't know it's this young kid's been in limbo\n\nSince that gunshot wound on that hidden road\n\nLost, broken, invisible\n\nBut when that light gets low, he's invincible\n\nSo much soul that he redefined inevitable\n\nSo it'll never go\n\nSo the sun never set at all instead of setting slow\n\nAnd as the legend goes Syre lived forever on\n\nAnd never and forever alone, Syre\n\n\n\nI'm rollin', I'm rollin'\n\nI'm rollin', I'm rollin'\n\nSaying that we'll run away\n\nI doubt that we'll ever go\n\nI hope the sunset will stay\n\nWe traveled too far from home\n\nBaby, we don’t need a hero\n\nI have never been a hero\n\nI have always been a zero\n\nBaby, you should be the hero\n\nBaby, you should be the hero\n\n\n\nLegend says Syre still exists in the mist, in the fog\n\nPoets say he ascended to the Gods\n\nSkeptics say he pretended to be gone\n\nBut I say that he's eternally lost"
