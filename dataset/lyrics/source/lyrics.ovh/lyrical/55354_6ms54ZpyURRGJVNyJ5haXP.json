  "lyrics": "Send off a letter, pick up the telephone\r\nLeave a message sometime when I'm not home\r\nIf it's not the thunder, it's the lightnin'\r\nCount my blessings when I find 'em\r\nGot my hands in my pocket, my feet on the ground\n\nI might whistle on occasion when there's no one else around\n\nI might whistle on occasion (Oooh)\n\n\n\nRoyal flush still beats a pair\n\nI grabbed the moment, held it there\n\nThis town looks smaller from a distance\n\nWhen I'm gone, I'm gonna miss it\n\n\n\nGot my hands in my pocket, my feet on the ground\n\nI might whistle on occasion when there's no one else around\n\nI might whistle on occasion (Oooh)\n\n\n\nEverybody needs somebody (yes they do)\n\nEverybody needs somebody like I need you\n\nLike I need you\n\n\n\nGot my hands in my pocket, my feet on the ground\n\nI might whistle on occasion when there's no one else around\n\nI might whistle on occasion (Oooh)"
