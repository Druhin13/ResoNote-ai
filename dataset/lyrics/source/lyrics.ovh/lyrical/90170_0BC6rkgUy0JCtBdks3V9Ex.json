  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Riptide par Unlike Pluto\r\nYou hit me like a rip tide\nBut I never noticed cuz you always kept it under disguise\nLifted up the curtain let me see what was on the inside\nAll of the lies and deceit\nAn ugly mess you created in me\nSomething that you knew I could never clean\nI’ll handle it someday\n\nSo hit me with a (the) riptide\nIf that’s the way you wanna say goodbye\nMy Anger’s been on standby\nSo hit me with, hit me with a rip tide\n\nBut hey, it was an honest mistake\n\nWe’ll go our separate ways\nWe don’t need to dig our own gravestones\nPush each other out till we’re alone\nThese fights are taking on the same tone\nOh it’s worse if I stay\nCuz you changed my personality\nI’ll close the door behind me\n\nSo hit me with a riptide\nIf that’s the way you wanna say goodbye\nMy anger’s been on standby\nSo hit me with, hit me with a rip tide\n\nAnd I have already moved on\nTo someone who won’t do me wrong\nI hope that one day you can see\nThe villain you are with me\nRelease your hold\n\nAnd I’m the one in control\nIf the riptide comes today\nYou're the only one that will wash away\n\nSo hit me with a riptide\nIf that’s the way you wanna say goodbye\nMy anger’s been on standby\nSo hit me with, hit me with a rip tide"
