  "lyrics": "Seeing you again could only make me\r\nKissing you again would probably break me\r\nAnd all the time we had to run around\r\nAnd all the trips we took to settle down\n\nIt's not worth what you thought\n\nYou think I'm cursed but I'm not\n\n\n\nKnowing that it's not about the waiting\n\nDon't even know what I'm anticipating\n\n\n\nYou've got all the power once again\n\nI try to fight but I'm stuck in your spin(?)\n\n\n\nIt's not worse than what you thought\n\nYou say we're cursed but we're not, we're not\n\n\n\nAnd you, gave up the first time\n\nAnd you, thought you read my mind\n\nAnd you, thought I cared more than you did\n\n\n\nBut did you have to quit even if I did?"
