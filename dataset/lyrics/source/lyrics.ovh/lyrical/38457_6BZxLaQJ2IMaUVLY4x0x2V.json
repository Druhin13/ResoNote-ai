  "lyrics": "Deep within your heart, you know it's plain to see \nLike Adam was to Eve, you were made for me \nThey say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wine \nOur love is easy \nIf you ask me plainly I would glady say \n\nI'd like to have you round just for them rainy days \n\nI like the touch of your hand, the way you make no demands \n\nOur love is easy \n\n\n\nOur love is easy \n\nLike water rushing over stone \n\nOh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known \n\n\n\nPhysically speaking we were made to last \n\nExamine all the pieces of our recent past \n\nThere's your mouth of tears \n\nYour hands around my waist \n\nOur love is easy \n\n\n\nEvery time we meet it's like the first we kiss \n\nNever growing tired of this endlessness \n\nIt's a simple thing, we don't need a ring \n\nOur love is easy \n\n\n\nOur love is easy \n\nLike water rushing over stone \n\nOh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known \n\n\n\n[Instrumental] \n\n\n\nOur love is easy \n\nLike water rushing over stone \n\nOh, our love is easy, like no love I've ever known \n\n\n\nDeep within your heart, you know it's plain to see \n\nLike Adam was to Eve, you were made for me \n\nThey say the poisoned vine breeds a finer wine"
