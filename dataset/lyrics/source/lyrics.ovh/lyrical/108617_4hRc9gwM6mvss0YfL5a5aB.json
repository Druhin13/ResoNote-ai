  "lyrics": "Bitch I've been on my kick, like Joe Rogan on gym days\r\nPickin' off the ticks crawlin' on me for free waves\r\nBut I'm drownin' these leeches in the water that they survived in\r\nPoisonin' your mind like MK Ultra but times ten\r\nYou wanna mess with the black magic, while I strike matches\r\nAnd buy patches, with rattlesnake fangs hissin' at ya\n\nMakin' your heart rate go faster until your spirit explodes\n\nHell, I cover up my problems by the dump truck load\n\n\n\nShe can [?] got the [?] in the club\n\nThey say I live too fast but I say I'm livin' good\n\nSpend a lot of cash at the trailer in the woods\n\nI'm swervin' off the road and then I'm so misunderstood\n\nTemple of the church in my rear view mirror\n\nNow smokin' that fire and we can't see clearer\n\nLook into the barrel, shotgun in my hand\n\nI'm searchin' for the answers, God, come and take my hands\n\nGod, come and take my hands\n\n\n\nI went from bein' a farm boy, to bein' the farm boy\n\nWith a million cameras always followin' me through the dark fold\n\nWhen the curtain opens up it's like they 'spect a new Elvis\n\nI'm the one and only Church, leave the suede in Memphis\n\n'Cause I'm too dirty for radio, too grimy for country\n\nTelevision shows talk to me like I'm stupid or somethin'\n\nAnd motherfucker I'm gold, even if my records don't turn\n\n'Cause all I need is tobacco fields and a tractor that runs\n\nSo before you attach to me like a six foot bush hog\n\nReal recognize real like war vets and outlaws\n\nI got somethin' you ain't got and somethin' you can't even learn\n\nThe Tennessee that say fuck y'all, roll one and burn\n\n\n\nShe can [?] got the [?] in the club\n\nThey say I live too fast but I say I'm livin' good\n\nSpend a lot of cash at the trailer in the woods\n\nI'm swervin' off the road and then I'm so misunderstood\n\nTemple of the church in my rear view mirror\n\nNow smokin' that fire and we can't see clearer\n\nLook into the barrel, shotgun in my hand\n\nI'm searchin' for the answers, God, come and take my hands\n\nGod, come and take my hands"
