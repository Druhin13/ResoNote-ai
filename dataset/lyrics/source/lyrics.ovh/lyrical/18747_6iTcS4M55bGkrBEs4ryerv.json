  "lyrics": "Leave the Sleep and let the springtime talk\r\nIn tongues from the time before man\r\nListen to a daffodil tell her tale\r\nLet the guest in, walk out, be the first to greet the morn\r\nThe meadows of heaven await harvest\n\nThe cliffs unjumped, cold waters untouched\n\nThe elsewhere creatures yet unseen\n\nFinally your number came up, free fall awaits the brave\n\n\n\nCome\n\nTaste the wine\n\nRace the blind\n\nThey will guide you from the light\n\nWriting noughts till the end of time\n\nCome\n\nSurf the clouds\n\nRace the dark\n\nIt feeds from the runs undone\n\nMeet me where the cliff greets the sea\n\n\n\nThe answer to the riddle before your eyes\n\nIs in dead leaves and fleeting skies\n\nReturning swans and sedulous mice\n\nWritings the gardens book, in the minute of a lover's look\n\n\n\nBuilding a sandcastle close to the shore\n\nA house of cards from a worn out deck\n\nA home from the fellowship, poise and calm\n\nWrite a lyric for the song only you can understand\n\n\n\nRiding hard every shooting star\n\nCome to life, open mind, have a laugh at the orthodox\n\nCome, drink deep let the dam of mind seep\n\nTravel with great Élan, dance a jig at the funeral\n\n\n\nCome!"
