  "lyrics": "I`m tired of playing on the team\nIt seems I don`t get time out anymore\nWhat a change if we set the pace face to face\nNo one even trying to score\nOh oh I can feel the magic of your touch\nAnd when you move in close a little bit means so much\n\nOoh yeah, you`ve got to understand baby\n\nTime out is what I`m here for\n\n\n\nOne on one I want to play that game tonight\n\nOne on one I know I want to play that \n\nOne on one I want to play that game tonight\n\nOne on one so slow \n\n\n\nYou can`t tell me you don`t miss me girl\n\nI think I might know you too well \n\nWonder what you`d say if you knew that I was coming tonight\n\nWant to? I want you can`t you tell \n\n\n\nOne on one I want to play that game tonight\n\nOne on one I know I want to play that \n\nOne on one I want to play that game tonight\n\nOne on one so slow \n\nThat`s all you need to know now\n\n\n\n`Cause if it`s really right there`s nothing else\n\nOne on one I want to play that game tonight..."
