  "lyrics": "(D. Henley, T.B. Schmit, and S. Smith)\r\nI've been walkin' through the fields\r\nAnd on the streets of town\r\nTrying to make sense of what you left me\r\nEverything that I believed in\n\nHas been turned upside down\n\nAnd now it seems the whole wide world's gone crazy\n\n\n\nBut when I feel like giving up\n\nAnd I'm ready to walk away\n\nIn the stillness, I can hear\n\nA voice inside me say\n\n\n\nDo something\n\nDo something\n\nIt's too late for saving face\n\nDon't just stand there takin' up space\n\nWhy don't you do something?\n\nDo something\n\nIt's not over\n\nNo, it's never too late\n\n\n\nYou were always on my side\n\nLove was all we had\n\nNow I sit and watch our love unraveling\n\nI pick up the morning paper\n\nAll the news is bad\n\nHow did we get on this road we're traveling?\n\n\n\nBut when I feel like giving up\n\nAnd there's nowhere left to go\n\nThat's the time I dig down deep\n\nThe only thing I know\n\n\n\nDo something\n\nDo something\n\nDon't leave it up for someone else\n\nDon't feel sorry for yourself\n\nWhy don't you do something?\n\nDo something\n\nIt's not over\n\nNo, it's never too late\n\n\n\nRun away\n\nYou can't run away\n\nFor your honor\n\nFor your pride\n\nYou'll sleep better\n\nKnowin' you tried\n\n\n\nTo do something\n\nDo something\n\nIt's too easy not to care\n\nYou're not ready for the rockin' chair\n\nGet up and do something\n\nDo something\n\nDon't wait too long\n\nEven if it's wrong\n\nYou've got to do something\n\nDo something\n\nIt's not over\n\nNo, it's never too late"
