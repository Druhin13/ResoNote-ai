  "lyrics": "I can't make sense of the mess around me\r\nI never knew You could feel so far away\r\nTragedy has shaken me and\r\nI'm trembling on my knees again\r\nWhen my world is torn apart\n\nYou remind me where You are\n\n\n\nYou are still here, You are still here\n\nDrawing desperately near\n\nOverwhelming my fear\n\nYou are still here\n\n\n\nYour grace is strong when I'm at my weakest\n\nYou sing a song when I have no words to say\n\nYour gravity is pulling me\n\nFrom my tears up to my feet to rise again\n\n\n\nYou are still here, You are still here\n\nDrawing desperately near\n\nOverwhelming my fear\n\nYou are still here\n\n\n\nWhere can I go, what can I go through\n\nWhere Your love has never been and Your mercy doesn't win\n\nYou're my hope and You're my rescue\n\nYou are with me to the end, You're with me to the end\n\n\n\nYou are still here, You are still here\n\nDrawing desperately near\n\nOverwhelming my fear\n\nYou are still here"
