  "lyrics": "Bars are all closed\r\nBut I can't stand the thought of going home\r\nCheap red wine, fireworks over the freeway\r\nStretching the sky\r\nWhen it rains in L.A. you all most forget\r\nHow it smells when the whole city is burning\n\n\n\nLet's drive around\n\nI want to see how other people live\n\nNeedless palaces kissing the hillside\n\nTake your pick\n\nEvery dream exactly like the last\n\nYou and I in a canyon on fire\n\n\n\nWho would I be without you?\n\nWho would I be without you?\n\nWho would I be without you?\n\n(Someone I don't know)\n\nWho would I be without you?\n\nSee right through me\n\nSee right through me\n\n\n\nSee right through me\n\nWho would I be without you?\n\nWho would I be without you?\n\nSee right through me"
