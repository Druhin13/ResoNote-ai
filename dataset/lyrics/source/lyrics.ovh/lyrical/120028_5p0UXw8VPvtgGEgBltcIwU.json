  "lyrics": "Wake up\r\nIt's Sunday, spent the weekend getting high\r\nWondering\r\nCan you feel if it's a sunset or a sunrise?\r\nPeople 'round here want love so bad\n\nThey don't care if you're faking it\n\nIf it feels fugazi, there's no changing\n\nThere's no mistaking\n\n\n\nYou only call me on the telephone\n\n'Cause I can't see the lies written on your face\n\nYour secrets know that place\n\nYou only find me in the night\n\nWhen I can't look in your eyes and ask you \"stay\"\n\nDo you feel this way?\n\n\n\nYou know\n\nWhen things are simple, they get hard\n\nAnd I know\n\nWith difficulties, we ain't ever made it far\n\n\n\nPeople 'round here want love so bad\n\nThey don't care if you're faking it\n\nIf it feels fugazi, there's no changing\n\nThere's no mistaking\n\n\n\nYou only call me on the telephone\n\n'Cause I can't see the lies written on your face\n\nYour secrets know that place\n\nYou only find me in the night\n\nWhen I can't look in your eyes and ask you \"stay\"\n\nDo you feel this way?\n\n\n\nJust tell me again why you're leaving\n\nSecond-guessing myself\n\nWhat I want and what I need are two very different things"
