  "lyrics": "Three years of therapy still hasn't got me right\r\nI still wake up crying on the floor\r\nAnd I know I feel too much sometimes\r\nIs that so wrong?\r\nSo just keep your emotional support\n\nOh, I just gotta do this on my own\n\nI'll ask all my demons what they want\n\nThink it's time we all just got along, yeah\n\n\n\nSo I'm trying to be friends with my sadness\n\nHaving drinks with my fears and bad habits\n\nWe're all in this together, we forever rise and fall\n\nSo I'm trying to be friends with my sadness\n\nSadness\n\nSadness\n\n\n\nGive me a minute please, before the lights come on\n\n'Cause I wanna know we got a chance\n\nI'm not concerned about anybody else\n\nCan we please just stop the tears and dance?\n\n\n\nOh, I just gotta do this on my own\n\nI'll ask all my demons what they want\n\nThink it's time we all just got along, yeah\n\n\n\nSo I'm trying to be friends with my sadness\n\nHaving drinks with my fears and bad habits\n\nWe're all in this together, we forever rise and fall\n\nSo I'm trying to be friends with my sadness\n\nCan we be friends?\n\nCan we be friends? Sadness\n\nCan we be friends? Oh, ah\n\nCan we be friends?\n\n\n\nSo I'm trying to be friends with my sadness\n\nHaving been drinks with my fears and bad habits\n\nWe're all in this together, we forever rise and fall\n\nSo I'm trying to be friends with my sadness"
