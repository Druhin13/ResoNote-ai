  "lyrics": "So you want me to drench a desert\r\nBad water is all I've got.\r\nYou ask me to imbue the poor\r\nBad water is all I've got.\r\nSo you want to perceive your life?\n\nBad water is in your mind.\n\nJoy will never fill your heart\n\nRed water turns into the tar.\n\n\n\nI am a cracked jar\n\nBad water's running through my eyes.\n\nI leak! It burns!\n\nBut still I can be refilled –\n\nIt returns…\n\n\n\nIt kills a seed, kills a breed,\n\nSmothers everything we need,\n\nPlugging our pores up.\n\nFlakes of salt drag to the start…\n\nOur lips are dry from constant cry,\n\nOur mouths are made of chalk and sand.\n\nIf only we could take one last sip,\n\nBackwater would invite us\n\nTo the one-way trip.\n\n\n\nThe sky is a cracked jar\n\nBad water's running through the clouds.\n\nIt leaks! It burns!\n\nBut still it can be refilled.\n\nIt returns…\n\n\n\nUntil we wash our feet in a creek,\n\nUntil we spit in a cup and then drink,\n\nTill we curse upon the sea,\n\nUntil the land can't shed a single tear…\n\nBad water is all we will be…"
