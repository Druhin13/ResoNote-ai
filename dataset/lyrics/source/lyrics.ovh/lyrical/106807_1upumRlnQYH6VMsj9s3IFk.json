  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson At my most beautiful par R.E.M\r\n   \n\nI've found a way to make you\nI've found a way\nA way to make you smile\nI read bad poetry\nInto your machine.\nI save your messages\nJust to hear your voice.\nYou always listen carefully\nTo awkard rhymes.\nYou always say your name,\nLike I wouldn't know it's you,\nAt your most beautiful.\n\nI've found a way to make you\n\nI've found away\nA way to make you smile\n\nAt my most beautiful\nI count your eyelashes, secretly.\nWith every one, whisper I love you.\nI let you sleep.\nI know you're closed eye watching me,\nListening.\nI thought I saw a smile.\n\nI've found a way to make you\nI've found a way\nA way to make you smile"
