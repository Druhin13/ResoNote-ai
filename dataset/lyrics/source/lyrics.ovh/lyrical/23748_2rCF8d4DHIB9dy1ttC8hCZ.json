  "lyrics": "Sonny say you will, take me strolling with you out on the boardwalk\r\n'Cause you know you always make me feel\r\nLike we are lovers on parade with your sweet talk\r\nYou look so cool but I know that you care\r\nThe way you run your fingers through my hair\n\nYou make me feel like I'm a star on your sleeve\n\nThe way you hold me it's so wild and sweet\n\n\n\nAnd Sonny say we will, go walking down by the ocean\n\n'Cause the night can get so still, and lovers they can get the notion\n\n\n\nThe street is crazy with the summer heat\n\nLost souls collide and try to land on their feet\n\nYou make me feel like I'm no ordinary girl\n\nWhy don't we walk out of this every day world\n\n\n\nAnd Sonny say we will, spend the night all alone together\n\nThis is some kinda wonderful, Sonny let it last forever\n\n\n\nOh Sonny say you will, Sonny let it last forever and ever and ever\n\nSonny say you will, I know you will\n\n\n\nI know you will"
