  "lyrics": "Kiss you in the park\r\nWe'll meet up after dark\r\nIn your car with the backseat southern summer\r\nIgnored all the missed calls from your mother\r\nAnd kiss me in the park\r\nWe'll meet up after dark\n\nAnd we'll talk until morning hits the windshield\n\nAnd paints yellow lines on the field\n\nNow you want to start\n\nWith someone not so far\n\nOh she's bubbly and sweet like a Coca-Cola\n\nI watch from my drink as you look her over\n\nThe town don't part too hard\n\nThey're sick of playing cards\n\nWith their luck, you want warm and I'm somethin' colder\n\nI'm putting your hands to her heart\n\n\n\nDon't think of my life anywhere but in your arms tonight\n\nWon't say it this time, can't even look back in your eyes\n\n\n\nKiss you in the park\n\nWe'll meet up after dark\n\nIt's a bite of the apple, the touch of your lips\n\nI'm stuck in the bathroom and sick over it\n\nYou're made from the stars\n\nAnd we watch from your car\n\nAndI'm just a victim of changing planets\n\nMy Scorpio rising and my parents\n\n\n\nDon't think of my life anywhere but in your arms tonight\n\nWon't say it this time, can't even look back in your eyes"
