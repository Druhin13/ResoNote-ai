  "lyrics": "(Dominic Bugatti, Frank Musker)\r\nOver night scenes, dinner and wine\r\nSaturday girls\r\nI was never in love, never had the time\r\nIn my hustle and hurry world\n\nLaughing myself to sleep, waking up lonely\n\nI needed someone to hold me, oh\n\n\n\nIt's such a crazy old town, it can bring you down\n\nTill you run out of dreams\n\nSo you party all night to the music and lights\n\nBut you don't know what happiness means\n\nI was dancin' in the dark with strangers\n\nNo love around me, when suddenly you found me, oh\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nGirl you're ev'ry woman in the world to me\n\nYou're my fantasy, you're my reality\n\nGirl you're ev'ry woman in the world to me\n\nYou're ev'rything I need\n\nYou're ev'rything to me, oh girl\n\n\n\nEv'rything good, ev'rything fine\n\nThat's what you are\n\nSo put your hand in mine and together\n\nWe'll climb as high as the highest star\n\nI'm living a lifetime in ev'ry minute that we're together\n\nAnd I'm stayin' right here forever oh\n\n\n\n[Chorus]"
