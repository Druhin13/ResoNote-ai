  "lyrics": "With a voice just like a razor\r\nOnly time can erase ya\r\nThe memory of you is unclear\r\nIn my rear view you disappear\r\nWhen familiar turns foreign\r\nYou know there's discord in the chorus\n\nUsually I would've folded but\n\n\n\nBut not tonight\n\nAin't gonna be alone, ain't gonna be alone\n\nBut not tonight\n\nAin't gonna be alone, ain't gonna be alone, oh\n\n\n\nI, I, I... I, I\n\n'Cause I owe you, you, you\n\nYeah, I owe you, you, you\n\nAnd I'm talking 'bout you, you, you\n\nI'm talking about you, you, you\n\n\n\nOh I want to hear your story\n\nWhilst I work through your inventory\n\nYour one-liners leave a shiner\n\nYou're not sober, and I'm not either\n\nOh, I wouldn't say I'm perfect\n\nYou can tell that from the surface\n\nBut I'd like to know your verdict, oh\n\n\n\nCause tonight\n\nYeah, I wanna take you home\n\nYeah, I wanna take you home\n\n'Cause tonight\n\nShouldn't have to be alone\n\nShouldn't have to be alone, oh\n\n\n\nI, I, I... I, I\n\n'Cause I owe you, you, you\n\nYeah, I owe you, you, you\n\nAnd I'm talking 'bout you, you, you\n\nI'm talking about you, you, you\n\n\n\nYour decision for my admission\n\nWas a plot twist, I must have missed it\n\nNow that we're a work in progress\n\nI guess that I should be honest\n\nI don't know where this will go\n\nBut I owe you\n\n\n\n'Cause I owe you, you, you\n\nYeah, I owe you, you, you\n\nAnd I'm talking 'bout you, you, you\n\nAnd I'm talking 'bout you, you, you"
