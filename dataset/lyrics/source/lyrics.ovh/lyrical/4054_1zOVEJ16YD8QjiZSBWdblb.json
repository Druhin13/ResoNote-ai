  "lyrics": "Down in Rockingham County I was born and raised\r\nI'll be a Rock-town rocker for the rest of my days\r\nI was a rebel with a heart big enough for two\r\nWhen I met you on the corner of Dixie Avenue\r\nJust a valley girl from out on 33\n\nFire in her eyes like the Devil's dream\n\nWe were two young lovers with nothin' to do\n\nSo we danced down the middle of Dixie Avenue\n\n\n\nDown at the Quick Lunch, makin' up plans\n\nRidin' with Jonny out to Raleigh Springs\n\nThis town's got no future: it's all in the past\n\nSo let's rattle our bones before they lay us to rest\n\n\n\nWhen the light comes shinin' from a southern moon\n\nWe'll be dancin' down the middle of Dixie Avenue\n\nWhen the big, bright sun starts a-burnin' through\n\nWe'll still be a-dancin' on Dixie Avenue\n\nKeep on dancin' on Dixie Avenue\n\n\n\nDown in Rockingham County summer fell into fall\n\nLeaves turned gold by the old stone wall\n\nWe met at the Quick Lunch, she told me the news\n\nThere's gonna be a daddy on Dixie Avenue\n\n\n\nDown at the courthouse, a-makin' up plans\n\nCallin' up Jonny, he's my best man\n\nThis town is our future, we put down our roots\n\nAnd bought a little house down on Dixie Avenue\n\n\n\nAnd when the light comes shinin' from a southern moon\n\nWe'll be dancin' down the middle of Dixie Avenue\n\nWhen the big, bright sun starts a-burnin' through\n\nWe'll still be a-dancin' on Dixie Avenue\n\nKeep on dancin' on Dixie Avenue\n\nKeep on dancin' on Dixie Avenue"
