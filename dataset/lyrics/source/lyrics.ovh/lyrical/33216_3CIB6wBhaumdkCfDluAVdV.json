  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Nine Point Eight par Mili\r\nCalla lily, carnation, daisy\nSilently chase away your worries\nChrysanthemum, kalanchoe\nBecome your shield whenever you fall asleep\n\nI cried out\n\"Please don’t leave me behind, leave me behind\"\nSo you held me tight\nAnd said I will be just fine, I will be just fine, I will be just fine\n\nPetals dance for our valediction\nAnd synchronize to your frozen pulsation\nTake me to where your soul may live in peace\nFinal destination\nTouch of your skin sympathetically brushed against\n\nThe shoulders you used to embrace\nSparkling ashes drift along your flames\nAnd softly merge into the sky\n\nLisianthus aroma drags me out of where I was\nCream rose, stargazer, iris\nConstruct the map that helps me trace your steps\n\nZipped my mouth\nI just keep climbing up, keep climbing up\nJustify our vows\nI know you are right above, you are right above, you are right above\n\nLook now\nI’m on the top of your world, top of your world\nMy darling\nHere I come, I yell\n\nAnd take a leap to Hell\n\nSwirling wind sings for our reunion\nAnd nine point eight is my acceleration\nTake me to where our souls may live in peace\nOur brand new commencement\nTouch of your lips compassionately pressed against\nThe skull that you used to cherish\nDelicate flesh decomposes off my rotten bones\nAnd softly merge into the sky"
