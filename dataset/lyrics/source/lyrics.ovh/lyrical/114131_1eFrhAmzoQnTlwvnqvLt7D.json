  "lyrics": "Eight years old a couple cane poles, sitting down by the creek\r\nOur lines in the water watching those bobbers, seeing that red sun sink\r\nMama's on the porch yelling \"Supper's hot, y'all come and get it!\"\r\nWe yelled five more minutes\r\nAt sixteen it was twelve o three, standing at her front door\n\nKatie's dad said midnight, but we needed just a little more\n\nYellow light flipping on and off, and we're up to that goodnight kissing\n\nWe wanted five more minutes\n\n\n\nTime rolls by the clock don't stop\n\nI wish I had a few more drops\n\nOf the good stuff, the good times\n\nOh but they just keep on flying\n\nRight on by like it ain't nothing\n\nWish I had me a pause button\n\nMoments like those Lord knows I'd hit it\n\nGive myself five more minutes\n\n\n\nAt eighteen, turned my helmet in, and walked to the fifty yard line\n\nIt's just the coach and me after we lost State ten to nine\n\nAnd I cried man next time to get in here I'll have to buy a ticket\n\nCan't you give me five more minutes\n\n\n\nTime rolls by the clock don't stop\n\nI wish I had a few more drops\n\nOf the good stuff, the good times\n\nOh but they just keep on flying\n\nRight on by like it ain't nothing\n\nWish I had me a pause button\n\nMoments like those Lord knows I'd hit it\n\nGive myself five more minutes\n\n\n\nAt eighty-six my grandpa said there's angels in the room\n\nAll the family gathered 'round we knew that time was coming soon\n\nWith so much left to say I prayed Lord I ain't finished\n\nJust give us five more minutes\n\n\n\nTime rolls by the clock don't stop\n\nI wish I had a few more drops\n\nOf the good stuff, the good times\n\nOh but they just keep on flying\n\nRight on by like it ain't nothing\n\nWish I had me a pause button\n\nMoments like those Lord knows I'd hit it\n\nYeah sometimes this all life will leave you wishing\n\nThat you had five more minutes\n\n\n\nFive more minutes"
