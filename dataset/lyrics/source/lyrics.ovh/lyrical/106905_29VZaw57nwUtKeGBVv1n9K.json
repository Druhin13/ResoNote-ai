  "lyrics": "Never thought I'd end up here\r\nNow our future seems so clear\r\nI can see the top of the world down here\r\nDrawing on the window pane\r\nWanna hear them say my name\n\nAll I have are whispers and dreams down here\n\n\n\nNothing hurts more than saying I'm fine\n\n\n\nNot a second to waste\n\nLife won't wait for you now\n\nThis is our time to go\n\n\n\nFeel the crash of the waves\n\nWash away all the thoughts\n\nThat come at you like monsters at night\n\n\n\nI don't wanna live this way\n\nStrong enough to break these chains\n\nBroken pieces can mend\n\n\n\nNot a second to waste\n\nLife won't wait for you now\n\nThis is our time, our time to go\n\n\n\nWhen I've got it figured out\n\nAll alone I get knocked down\n\nLooking at the stars from the floor, down here\n\n\n\nCan't be held down in this place\n\nYou can see it in my face\n\nWishing I could open the door, down here\n\n\n\nNothing hurts more than saying I'm fine\n\n\n\nNot a second to waste\n\nLife won't wait for you now\n\nThis is our time to go\n\n\n\nFeel the crash of the waves\n\nWash away all the thoughts\n\nThat come at you like monsters at night\n\n\n\nI don't wanna live this way\n\nStrong enough to break these chains\n\nBroken pieces can mend\n\n\n\nNot a second to waste\n\nLife won't wait for you now\n\nThis is our time, our time to go\n\n\n\nI'm walking down this road\n\nNobody's hand to hold\n\nWay past the point of no return\n\nYou strike a match, get burned\n\n\n\nNot a second to waste\n\nLife won't wait for you now\n\nThis is our time to go\n\n\n\nFeel the crash of the waves\n\nWash away all the thoughts\n\nThat come at you like monsters at night\n\n\n\nI don't wanna live this way\n\nStrong enough to break these chains\n\nBroken pieces can mend\n\n\n\nNot a second to waste\n\nLife won't wait for you now\n\nThis is our time, our time to go"
