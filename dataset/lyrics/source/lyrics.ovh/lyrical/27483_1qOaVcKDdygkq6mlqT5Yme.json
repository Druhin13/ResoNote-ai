  "lyrics": "I was down my dreams were wearing thin\r\nWhen you're lost where do you begin\r\nMy heart always seemed to drift from day to day\r\nLooking for the love that never came my way\r\nThen you smiled and I reached out to you\n\nI could tell you were lonely too\n\nOne look then it all began for you and me\n\nThe moment that we touched I knew that there would be\n\n\n\nTwo less lonely people in the world\n\nAnd it's gonna be fine\n\nOut of all the people in the world\n\nI just can't believe you're mine\n\nIn my life where everything was wrong\n\nSomething finally went right\n\nNow there's two less lonely people\n\nIn the world tonight\n\n\n\nJust to think what I might have missed\n\nLooking back how did I exist\n\nI dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far\n\nBut miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are\n\n\n\nTwo less lonely people in the world\n\nAnd it's gonna be fine\n\nOut of all the people in the world\n\nI just can't believe you're mine\n\nIn my life where everything was wrong\n\nSomething finally went right\n\nNow there's two less lonely people\n\nIn the world tonight \n\n\n\nTonight I fell in love with you\n\nAnd all the things I never knew\n\nSeemed to come to me somehow\n\nBaby, love is here and now there's\n\n\n\nTwo less lonely people in the world\n\nAnd it's gonna be fine\n\nOut of all the people in the world\n\nI just can't believe you're mine\n\nIn my life where everything was wrong\n\nSomething finally went right\n\nNow there's two less lonely people\n\nIn the world tonight"
