  "lyrics": "After all these years,\r\nAfter all these tears between us\r\nStill I couldn't find\r\nSomeone half as right as you\r\nAnd each time I stop to think\r\nWhat it is I truly need\n\nHere's what I conclude\n\nAll I really need is you\n\n\n\nJust say what you want to say\n\nYou don't have a chance in the world\n\nCan I, knowin' how I've tried\n\nStill come close to losing you, girl\n\nWhen you are my world\n\n\n\nHave I, spent these many years\n\nTryin' but in vain to tell you\n\nDon't you know it too?\n\nAll I really need is you\n\n\n\nHow could I have known\n\nWe'd have ended here\n\nWhere we finally did?\n\nYou hooked your life to mine\n\nOnce upon a starry night\n\n\n\nNow when someone asks of me\n\nWhat it is that I believe\n\nSay, I believe it's true\n\nAll I really need is you\n\n\n\nJust say what you want to say\n\nYou don't have a chance in the world\n\nCan I, knowin' how I've tried\n\nStill come close to losing you girl\n\nWhen you are my world\n\nHave I spent these many years\n\nTryin' but in vain to tell you\n\n\n\nFeelings come and go\n\nMe, I'm never gonna\n\nEver let you go\n\nPromise you I'm gonna\n\nAlways love you so\n\nAnd all I really need is you"
