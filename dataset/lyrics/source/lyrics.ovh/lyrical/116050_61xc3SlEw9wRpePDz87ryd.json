  "lyrics": "All my windows were barred\r\nThe sun made stripes of shade\r\nI was sitting around like a zombie\r\nFeeding my own face\r\nI was counting my chi\n\nI was digging my strange\n\nI was taking you for granted\n\nWhile you were holding the reins\n\n\n\nI can hear you louder than ever\n\nWhisper to me\n\nHelp me remember\n\nI can't see you but\n\nwe're still together\n\nI can hear you louder than ever\n\n\n\nIt's a slippery slope\n\nLike that mouse trap game\n\nInside my tunnel vision \n\nYou stepped on my train\n\n\n\nBut\n\nI can hear you louder than ever\n\nWhisper to me\n\nHelp me remember\n\nI can't see you but\n\nwe're still together\n\nI can hear you louder than ever\n\n\n\nI don't want to ignore\n\nYou or the past or my feelings\n\nWe're probably gonna get out of this just\n\nHear me out anyway\n\nA darkness snuck in\n\nNow I'm doubting all my promises\n\nDon't try and pull me out of this just\n\nlay down by me and wait\n\n\n\nI can hear you louder than ever\n\nWhisper to me\n\nHelp me remember\n\nI can't see you but\n\nwe're still together\n\nI can hear you louder than eve\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Misty Chamberlin for these lyrics)"
