  "lyrics": "John you're right\r\nIt's good to know you're bright\r\nFor intellect can wash away confusion\r\nGeorgie sees\r\nAnd Annabelle agrees\r\nMost folderol's an optical illusion\n\nYou three know it's true\n\nThat one plus one is two\n\nYes, logic is the rock of our foundation\n\nI suspect and I'm never incorrect\n\nThat you're far too old to give in to imagination\n\nNo, not yet\n\nSome people like to splash and play\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nAnd take a seaside holiday\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nToo much glee lives rings around the brain\n\nTake that joy and send it down the drain\n\nSome people like to laugh at life\n\nAnd giggle through the day\n\nThey think the world's a brand new shiny toy\n\nAnd if while dreaming in the clouds\n\nThey fall and go kersplatt\n\nAlthough they're down and bent in half\n\nThey brush right off and start to laugh\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\n\"On second door perhaps you're right, it makes no sense to take a bath this early\"\n\n\"Wait! I want to take a bath!\"\n\n\"Oh, really? Up you go and in you go\"\n\n\"Georgie! What happened, will I be alright?\"\n\n\"Well, it is just a bath after all, but then again it's not my tub\"\n\n\"Shouldn't you go in after them?\"\n\n\"Oh no I had my bath this morning, thank you\"\n\n\"Well, if you won't, I will!\"\n\n\"Off we go\"\n\nSome people like to dive right in\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nAnd flap about in bathtub gin\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nDoggies paddling twenty leagues below\n\nMight seem real but we know it's not so\n\nTo cook without a recipe\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nAnd heaven knows what lives within that pot\n\nSome pirates follow treasure maps\n\nAnd wear a silly hat\n\nThey search the world for buried gold\n\nThey won't grow up and don't grow old\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nBe sure to scrub behind your ears\n\nSome answer when adventure calls\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nAnd sail straight over waterfalls\n\nCan you imagine that?\n\nThey see living as it's own reward (ahoy!)\n\nWe rock the boat then (man overboard!)\n\nSome people look out on the sea\n\nAnd see a brand new day\n\nTheir spirit lives them high above the blue\n\nYet some others spear an anchor\n\nAnd they sink in seconds flat\n\nSo, perhaps we've learned when day is done\n\nSome stuff and nonsense could be fun\n\nCan you imagine that?"
