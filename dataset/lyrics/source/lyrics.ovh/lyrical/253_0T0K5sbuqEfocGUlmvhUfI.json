  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Brooklyn In The Summer par Aloe Blacc\r\nRemember we sat in the cold, no money in my Trio\nUnderneath that waterfall nobody else ever saw\nI packed up everything except those memories\nThat only I can see, and can't get rid of\nI still remember the first, your body hit every nerve\nUsed to wake up in my shirt, that's the one I had to burn\nTrying not to stare, but you are everywhere\nYou're everywhere that I ever known\n\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen hiding, had to wait for so long\nAnd it's the subtleties, you've only ever seen\nBringing the mess of me back together\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\n\nBeen stumbling, half awake for so long\nGotta forget that feeling, give into something real\nI've got, I've gotta let you go\nGotta let you go\n\nThis morning I walked to the train, just like you did every day\nEveryone else is the same, I wonder if you're the same\nAnd do you lay your head in someone else's bed\nTo help you bury it? Just like you always did\nAnd now you're in all of my words, only way I can return\nMemories fade in reverse, but you will always be heard\nWherever I can sing, you'll be right there with me\n\nThe notes and melodies that only I can see\n\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen hiding, had to wait for so long\nAnd it's the subtleties, you've only ever seen\nBringing the mess of me back together\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen stumbling, half awake for so long\nGotta forget that feeling, give into something real\nI've got, I've gotta let you go\nGotta let you go\n\nBut maybe I'm not really ready to give up you\n'Cause nobody ever mattered to me like you do\n'Cause you're so up here, I caught that feeling\nAnd touch the ceiling, ooh\nI wish I could describe it with words just ain't enough\n\nAnd nothing that I could say would ever measure up\nBut what I can't stand is you're outta my hands\nAnd up outta your plans, ooh\n\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen hiding, had to wait for so long\nAnd it's the subtleties, you've only ever seen\nBringing the mess of me back together\nYou feel like Brooklyn in the summer\nBeen stumbling, half awake for so long\nGotta forget that feeling, give into something real\nI've got, I've gotta let you go\nGotta let you go"
