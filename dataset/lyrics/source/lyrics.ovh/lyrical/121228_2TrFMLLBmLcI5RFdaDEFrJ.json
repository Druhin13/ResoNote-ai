  "lyrics": "Walking these streets again, thinking back when I was ten\r\nWhen my bike got stolen and dad, he drove me\r\nTill we found that old thing in\r\nIn that sketchy parking lot, behind the market that's long gone\r\nWhere I used to roll that shopping cart down every aisle with mom\r\nI miss when\n\n\n\nBack when we were kids and the world was ours\n\nBack when we were kids, before all the scars\n\nBack when we were kids, where we'd never part\n\nBack when we were kids, everything felt like this\n\nBack when we were kids, everything felt like this\n\nBack when we were kids\n\n\n\nIt's been playing in my head, seeing these posters above my bed\n\nAbout the first night that I got drunk, and everything we said\n\nAll we talked about was girls and booze, but we never had a plan\n\nAnd the only thing we ever knew, is when the cops showed up we ran\n\nI miss when\n\n\n\nBack when we were kids and the world was ours\n\nBack when we were kids, before all the scars\n\nBack when we were kids, where we'd never part\n\nBack when we were kids, everything felt like this\n\nBack when we were kids, everything felt like this\n\nBack when we were kids\n\n\n\nEvery road, driving in\n\nI was so innocent\n\nReminiscient about trying to get the explicit edition of Eminem\n\nMan, back when we were kids again\n\nWhen we only went to movies for the back row\n\nWhen we only needed chalk and the asphalt\n\nWe knew this would happen\n\nTo be back to back to back when, back when, back when\n\n\n\nBack when we were kids and the world was ours\n\nBack when we were kids, before all the scars\n\nBack when we were kids, where we'd never part\n\nBack when we were kids, everything felt like this\n\n\n\nBack when we were kids and the world was ours\n\nBack when we were kids, before all the scars\n\nBack when we were kids, where we'd never part\n\nBack when we were kids, everything felt like this\n\nBack when we were kids"
