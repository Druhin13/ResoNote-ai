  "lyrics": "I can't lie, I'm fallin\r\nThe floor gave out again\r\nThe walls are cavin in\r\nI've got these voices in my head\r\nI don't know why, I'm broken\r\nMy world is sinkin in\n\nI've got these voices in my head\n\nI've got these voices in my head\n\nThey tell me that I'm not enough\n\nIs it my time? Is it my time?\n\n\n\nEven when I'm high I still feel low\n\nVoices in my head won't leave me alone\n\nI keep fallin, fallin\n\nOver the edge\n\nIn over my head again\n\nI'm so damn low\n\n\n\nI'm on my own, I know it\n\nThe lights all start to fade\n\nThe colors turn to grey\n\nI think I'm too far gone to save\n\nI can't let go, I'm holdin\n\nI feel it slip away\n\nI think I'm too far gone to save\n\nI think I'm too far gone to save\n\n\n\nThey tell me that I'm not enough\n\nThe more they say the more they cut\n\nIs it my time? I've gotta let it go\n\nIs it my time? Is it my time?\n\n\n\nEven when I'm high I still feel low\n\nVoices in my head won't leave me alone\n\nI keep fallin, fallin\n\nOver the edge\n\nIn over my head again\n\nEven when I'm high I still feel low\n\nI'm hangin by a thread, don't know if I let go\n\nCuz I keep fallin, fallin\n\nOver the edge\n\nIn over my head again\n\nI'm so damn low\n\n\n\nI'm doin everything I can to try and fix the problem\n\nThis is how it feels when you hit rock bottom\n\nYea when you hit rock bottom\n\n\n\nEven when I'm high I still feel low\n\nVoices in my head won't leave me alone\n\nI keep fallin, fallin\n\nI keep fallin\n\n\n\nEven when I'm high I still feel low\n\nI'm hangin by a thread, don't know if I let go\n\nCuz I keep fallin, fallin\n\nOver the edge\n\nIn over my head\n\nI'm so damn low\n\nI'm so damn low"
