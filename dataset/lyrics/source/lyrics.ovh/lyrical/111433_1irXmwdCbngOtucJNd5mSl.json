  "lyrics": "Wide awake in this violet city\r\nWhere it washes over me\r\nIt hurts to say that I want you with me\r\nJust draped across my frame\r\nI can't help myself\n\nThe moment that I let it go\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (in control)\n\nI need something else\n\nThe moment that I let it go\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (in control)\n\nIn control (in control)\n\nI can't help myself\n\nThe moment that I let it go\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (I'm in control)\n\n\n\nIn a maze of my expectation\n\nI just feel so far away\n\nHolding on to these empty spaces\n\nAs I try to find my way\n\nCause I'm somewhere else\n\nSurrounded by the city shelf\n\nTrying to appease all my desires\n\nCause I'm somewhere else\n\nBelieve me I'm beside myself\n\nI've been trying to change\n\n\n\nI can't help myself\n\nThe moment that I let it go\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (in control)\n\nI need something else\n\nThe moment that I let it go\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (I'm in control)\n\nI can't help myself\n\nThe moment that I let it go\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (in control)\n\nIs when I find I'm in control (in control)"
