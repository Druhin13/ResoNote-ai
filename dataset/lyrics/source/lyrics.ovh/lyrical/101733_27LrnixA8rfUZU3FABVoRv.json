  "lyrics": "So what's it gonna be, the fix up or the falling out?\r\nIt's hard to get a read of the signal that you're sending out\r\nAnd if you're wanna leave, then there's not much to talk about\r\nI'm looking for relief but still wanting if you stick around\r\nSo I don't wanna take the blame tonight\n\nI wanna get lost in far behind\n\nBut I don't wanna let it go\n\nNo I don't wanna let it go\n\nIt's funny how you found complacency\n\nYou tuning up the thought of you and me\n\nNow you gotta let it go\n\nNow you gotta let me go\n\n\n\nI thought the worst was you giving up\n\nBut now it's chasing feelings just to be okay\n\nYou knew the northern weather wasn't enough\n\nTo bother at all, it's all drifting away\n\nWith the way we used to be\n\n\n\nSo what did you expect, a rescue or a getaway\n\nIf I had your back, I'd take you getting over me\n\nSo tell it to my face, don't hide behind poetry\n\nI'll find a better place for you and all your apathy\n\n\n\nSo I don't wanna take the blame tonight\n\nI wanna get lost in far behind\n\nBut I don't wanna let it go\n\nNo I don't wanna let it go\n\nIt's funny how you found complacency\n\nYou tuning up the thought of you and me\n\nNow you gotta let it go\n\nNow you gotta let me go\n\n\n\nI thought the worst was you giving up\n\nBut now it's chasing feelings just to be okay\n\nYou knew the northern weather wasn't enough\n\nTo bother at all, it's all drifting away\n\nWith the way we used to be\n\n\n\nWhen did you get up causing problems\n\nWhen did you get up and I'm not around\n\nIt's hard to blush it off when you constantly calling me\n\nCause baby you get up when I'm down\n\n\n\nI thought the worst was you giving up\n\nBut now it's chasing feelings just to be okay\n\nYou knew the northern weather wasn't enough\n\nTo bother at all, it's all drifting away\n\nWith the way we used to be\n\n\n\nIt's all drifting away\n\nWith the way we used to be"
