  "lyrics": "Mother holds her head up high\r\nConquering the great divide\r\nA thousand miles beyond the grave\r\nWith shadows in the blind\r\nMother knows what must be done\n\nFight for her precious ones\n\nThere can be no compromise\n\nNo matter what may come\n\n\n\nWhen all hope is left to die\n\nA mother's love survives\n\n\n\nMother never bows to fate\n\nGrieving for what can't be changed\n\nWe discover in due time\n\nHow much we're meant to take\n\n\n\nWhen all hope is left to die\n\nA mother's love survives\n\n\n\nSee how we run\n\nTrying to escape the damage done\n\nDon't know what's to come\n\nThis bond will never break we'll overcome\n\n\n\nMother you may never know\n\nThe debt I owe to you alone\n\nI hope I can repay in time\n\nFor never letting go\n\n\n\nWhen all hope was left to die\n\nYour love for me survived\n\nYour love for me survived\n\nYour love for me survived"
