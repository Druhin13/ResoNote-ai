  "lyrics": "Old days, sunny in the state\r\nIn your 1968, driving to infinity\r\nYou want the moon, I'll lasso it to you\r\nShining on the hood like a fantasy\r\nFrom my heart to my head\n\nTo my hands, through my fingertips\n\nFrom the dark in my bed in my skin\n\n\n\nScenes that repeat, PTSD\n\nI only remember the beautiful things\n\nCold sweat, high heat, PTSD\n\nI only remember the beautiful things\n\n\n\nOld nights, swimming in the skies\n\nBathing in the lights, looking up the down below\n\nHow you could melt the avenue\n\nStreet lights burning blue when you're out to glow\n\n\n\nWhat's a fire, I forget\n\nIn the end I would let you slip through the dark\n\nIn my bed, in my skin\n\n\n\nScenes that repeat, PTSD\n\nI only remember the beautiful things\n\nCold sweat, high heat, PTSD\n\n\n\nEmotional, motion sickness\n\nI think I'm cavin' in\n\nCan't let my memories win\n\n\n\nTorn apart but my mind's with the stars, with the universe\n\nCan't let go of the high of our hearts, of the way it hurt\n\n\n\nScenes that repeat, PTSD\n\nI only remember the beautiful things\n\nCold sweat, high heat, PTSD\n\nI only remember the beautiful things\n\nScenes that I need, PTSD\n\nI only remember the beautiful things\n\n\n\nRemember me, PTSD"
