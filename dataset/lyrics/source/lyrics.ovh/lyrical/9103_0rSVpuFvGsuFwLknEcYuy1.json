  "lyrics": "Here in the glow I am immobile\r\nHow did he run over and over\r\nWax is a typical reminder\r\nFlames you into all your anger\r\nFate watch\n\nRe-combed and washes and repeats itself\n\n\n\nHere when the best of us are cloudy\n\nHe really was sometimes a stranger\n\nYou say you built it in our image\n\nHow I fear we'd speak a broken language\n\n\n\nFate watch\n\nRe-combed and washes and repeats itself\n\nGo on\n\nI can't let go no more, no\n\n\n\nHere in the glow I am immobile\n\nI let it run over and over"
