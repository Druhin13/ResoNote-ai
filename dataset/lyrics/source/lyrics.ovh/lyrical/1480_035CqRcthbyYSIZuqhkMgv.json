  "lyrics": "Cafes and boulevards, strangers in concrete parks\r\nI know you'll love it I know you'll love it\r\nKingdom without a Queen\r\nJust till you come to me\r\nI know you'll love it I know you'll love it\n\nI can't wait for you to get here\n\nI can't wait for you to get here\n\n\n\nPictures for picture frames, padlock with all our names\n\nJust like we planned it's just like we planned it\n\nCoach on an airplane, back in my arms again\n\nJust like we planned it call in your landing\n\n\n\nI can't wait for you to get here\n\nI can't wait for you to get here\n\nI can't wait for you to get here\n\nI know you'll love it I know you'll love it\n\n\n\nFunny how my whole world could change\n\nIf you're not here I'm not the same\n\nWe were pickin' rings and riding trains\n\nNow we're pickin' paint and middle names\n\n\n\nPaint for the room you'll live in\n\nMama's eyes and your daddy's chin\n\nI know you'll love it I know you'll love it\n\nYou're under layers of skin\n\nThat's how a life begins\n\nWait till you get here wait till you get here\n\n\n\nI can't wait for you to get here\n\nI can't wait for you to get here"
