  "lyrics": "I got a little drunk last night\r\nThere's something 'bout a midnight rain\r\nStaring at the ceiling fan\r\nI couldn't get you off my brain\r\nI guess I wasn't thinking straight\n\nI couldn't tell wrong from right\n\nI went ahead and called you up\n\nI got a little drunk last night\n\n\n\nI brought it all up, got it all out\n\nWhat is it worth, to both of us now\n\nIt's off my chest, but never off my mind\n\nTwo drinks in, keep that hurt,\n\nYou feel bad, and I feel worse\n\nI swear it's the last the last time every time\n\nDon't know why\n\n\n\nMight've been a song on the radio\n\nMight've been nothing, baby I don't know\n\nMight've been a little too tired to fight\n\nMight've been I got a little drunk last night\n\n\n\nI got a little too far gone\n\nI was talking way too loud\n\nI don't remember what I said\n\nI just remember breaking down\n\n\n\nI brought it all up, got it all out\n\nWhat is it worth, to both of us now\n\nIt's off my chest, but never off my mind\n\nTwo drinks in, keep that hurt,\n\nYou feel bad, and I feel worse\n\nI swear it's the last the last time every time\n\nDon't know why\n\n\n\nMight've been a song on the radio\n\nMight've been nothing, baby I don't know\n\nMight've been a girl who looked like you\n\nMight've been a fluke, might've been a full moon\n\nMight've been a little too tired to fight\n\nMight've been I got a little drunk last night\n\n\n\nMight've been a song on the radio\n\nMight've been nothing, baby I don't know\n\nMight've been a girl who looked like you\n\nMight've been a fluke, might've been a full moon\n\nMight've been a little too tired to fight\n\nMight've been I got a little drunk\n\n\n\nI brought it all up, got it all out\n\nWhat is it worth, to both of us now\n\nIt's off my chest, but never off my mind\n\nTwo drinks in, keep that hurt,\n\nYou feel bad, and I feel worse\n\nI swear it's the last the last time every time\n\n\n\nI got a little drunk last night\n\nI got a little drunk last night\n\nThought I could keep it all inside\n\nBut I got a little drunk last night"
