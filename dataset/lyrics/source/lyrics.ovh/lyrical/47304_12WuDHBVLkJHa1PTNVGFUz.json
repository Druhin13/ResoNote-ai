  "lyrics": "Your hands on my skin\r\nBut I can't feel a thing\r\nWish I could let you in\r\nPoison in my veins\r\nIt's taking over me\r\nMaybe I can't breathe\n\nIn a wishing well, I throw pennies, throw pennies\n\nWishing there would be magic, be magic\n\nAnd you deserve some good loving, good loving\n\nSo, baby, don't you wait for me, wait for me\n\n'Cause I'm incapable of falling for you\n\nWhy? Nothing else that I rather do, I\n\nBut the ones I end up with\n\nAre the ones that shoot me dead\n\nIncapable of falling for you\n\nWaiting to be sane\n\nAnd, baby, your a saint\n\nSo maybe I'm insane?\n\nWhen love equals pain\n\nI saw for you to change\n\nAnd love somebody safe\n\nIn a wishing well, I throw pennies, throw pennies\n\nWishing there would be magic, be magic\n\nAnd you deserve some good loving, good loving\n\nSo, baby, don't you wait for me, wait for me\n\nI'm incapable of falling for you\n\nWhy? Nothing else that I rather do, I\n\nBut the ones I end up with\n\nAre the ones that shoot me dead\n\nIncapable of falling for you\n\n'Cause I'm incapable of falling for you\n\nWhy? Nothing else that I rather do, I\n\nBut the ones I end up with\n\nAre the ones that shoot me dead\n\nIncapable of falling for you\n\nYour hands on my skin\n\nBut I can't feel a thing\n\nWish I could let you in\n\nI'm incapable of falling for you\n\nI'm incapable of falling for you\n\nIncapable of falling for you\n\nI'm incapable, I'm incapable\n\nI'm incapable of falling for you\n\nWhy? Nothing else that I rather do, I\n\nBut the ones I end up with\n\nAre the ones that shoot me dead\n\nIncapable of falling for you\n\nBut the ones I end up with\n\nAre the ones that shoot me dead\n\nIncapable of falling for you"
