  "lyrics": "Broken the bones lie scattered\nDimly the torch is lit\nThere's a snake coiling inside of you\n\n\nThere's a reek that you emit\n\n\n\nReachinh down through the layers of flesh\n\n\n\nIt grabs you by the throat\n\n\n\nFalling down it's hard to breathe\n\n\n\nScornfully dancing on your grave\n\n\n\n\n\nWould we see you if you came to us?\n\n\n\nNo never to see your face\n\n\n\nNever to find a way back\n\n\n\nWould we see you cum nimbus\n\n\n\nIf you came to us?\n\n\n\nNo never to see your face\n\n\n\nNever to find a way back\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly\n\n\n\nHoly\n\n\n\nHoly was the way\n\n\n\nShe was justified by all her children\n\n\n\nBut never here to stay\n\n\n\nSaturn broods, Saturn knows\n\n\n\nHe is shown to us\n\n\n\nBut we mourn\n\n\n\nWe mourn the death of Sophia\n\n\n\n\n\nWould we see you if you came to us?\n\n\n\nNo never to see your face\n\n\n\nNever to find a way back\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a world of drought I've got nothing to say\n\n\n\nBlindfolded and mute\n\n\n\nNight is day\n\n\n\nSanctum\n\n\n\nSanctum\n\n\n\nSanctum\n\n\n\nTravel through the maze, navigate well\n\n\n\n\n\nWould we see you\n\n\n\nWould we see you if you came to us?\n\n\n\nIf you came to us?\n\n\n\nIf you came, if you cum for us\n\n\n\nNever to see your face\n\n\n\nNo never, never to find a way back"
