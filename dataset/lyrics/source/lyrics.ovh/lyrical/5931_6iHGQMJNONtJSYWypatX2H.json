  "lyrics": "Help me make my mind up then as you're tying up my shoes\r\nMy ego sang me lullabies and my conscience sang the blues\r\nIt took me to a crossroads once and said I had a choice\r\nBut he couldn't hear me make my bed over his own voice\r\nSo if I climb the mountain now in my patent leather shoes\r\nAnd I touch the hand of God up there, will you still help me choose?\n\n\n\nThey tried to tell me you were cold\n\nAnd you're impossible to hurt\n\nNow I've heard that said about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nIf that's true about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\n\n\nYes, I got your article on the shape of things to come\n\nI'm glad you're feeling guilty now, that you're better off than some\n\nBut I think you sent donations to the wrong side of the road\n\nSo I took 'em from their window sill and served 'em a la mode\n\n\n\nThey tried to tell me you were cold\n\nBut they would eat you for dessert\n\nNow I've heard that said about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nIf that's true about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nLa-da-da, la-da-da-da-da\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nLa-da-da, la da-da-da-da\n\nWhy don't they put it on a T-shirt?\n\n\n\nHelp me make my mind up then as you're tying up my shoes\n\nMy ego sang me lullabies and my conscience sang the blues\n\nI'm sleeping in the kitchen now, my feet are in the hall\n\nMy picture's on her piano, my head is off the wall\n\n\n\nThey tried to tell me you were cold\n\nAnd you're impossible to hurt\n\nNow I've heard that said about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nIf that's true about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nIf that's true about the both of us\n\nThey should put it on a T-shirt\n\nIf that's true about the both of us\n\nWhy don't they put it on a T-shirt?"
