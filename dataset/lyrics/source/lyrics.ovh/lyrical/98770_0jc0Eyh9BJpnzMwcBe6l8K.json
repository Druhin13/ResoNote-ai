  "lyrics": "Here we go again\r\nPack your bags and leave all caution to the wind\r\nI've got a bad feeling that the roads you take\r\nWill take longer than we planned\r\nWe used to drive all night on the 319\n\nSinging songs with our friends that you threw away\n\nYou know, you dropped the bomb that killed the night\n\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd cancel every plan that I've made today\n\nAnd drive as far away to a place where no one knows my name\n\n\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\n\n\nHere's the place I'm at now\n\nAt least you made me better with my goodbyes\n\nConsider it a lesson to learn how to get through\n\nFeeling hopeless for the first time\n\n\n\nWe used to drive all night on the 319\n\nSinging songs with our friends that you threw away\n\nYou know, you dropped the bomb that killed the night\n\nBut we made it out alive\n\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd cancel every plan that I've made today\n\nAnd drive as far away to a place where no one knows my name\n\nIf I were you, I'd take back everything I once claimed to be\n\nI'd sing old songs that we used to sing\n\n\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\nLonely, lonely\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\nLonely, lonely\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\n\n\nWe used to drive all night on the 319\n\nSinging songs with our friends that you threw away\n\n\n\nWe used to drive all night on the 319\n\nSinging songs with our friends that you threw away\n\nYou know, you dropped the bomb that killed the night\n\nBut we made it out alive\n\n\n\nIf I were you, I'd cancel every plan that I've made today\n\nAnd drive as far away to a place where no one knows my name\n\nIf I were you, I'd take back everything I once claimed to be\n\nI'd sing old songs that we used to sing\n\n\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\nLonely, lonely\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\nLonely, lonely\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\nLonely, lonely\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely\n\nLonely, lonely\n\nIt's 3 A.M. and I'm lonely"
