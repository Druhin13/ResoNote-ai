  "lyrics": "Miles and miles apart, darling look how far we've come\r\nI wish we would be closer, but we're speaking different tongues\r\nAnd like a kind mirage that's been playing the desert sun\r\nEverything I wanted became nothing real at all\r\nAnd I don't know what I'm chasing\n\nMaybe I'll never know\n\nWhen everything else around me is fading\n\nI don't know where to go\n\n\n\nLet the rain come down\n\nI just wanna feel again\n\nLet the rain come down\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm chasing\n\nMaybe I'll never know\n\nWhen everything else around me is fading\n\nI don't know where to go\n\n\n\n\n\nI could fly to the stars\n\nI could die in your arms\n\nI could fly to the stars\n\nI could die in your arms\n\nI could fly to the stars\n\n\n\nRacing in my mind, doing 100 in a 60\n\nI been swerving in the car driving demons out the city\n\nRacing in my mind, doing 100 in a 60\n\nI been swerving in the car driving demons out the city\n\nRacing in my mind, doing 100 in a 60\n\nI been swerving in the car driving demons out the city\n\nRacing in my mind, doing 100 in a 60\n\nI been swerving in the car driving -- out the city\n\n\n\nRunning all the lights\n\nAll I see is red with the devil in the district\n\nRunning out of time\n\nI just gotta drive till I figure how to fix this\n\nRunning all the lights\n\nAll I see is red with the devil in the district\n\nRunning out of time\n\nI just gotta drive till I figure how to fix this\n\nRunning all the lights\n\nAll I see is red with the devil in the district\n\nRunning out of time\n\nI just gotta drive till I figure how to fix this"
