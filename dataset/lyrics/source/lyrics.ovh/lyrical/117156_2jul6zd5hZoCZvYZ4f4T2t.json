  "lyrics": "Girl I know you had a long day\r\nYou ain't feelin' them downtown lights\r\nBut I got a bottle at your favorite place\r\nJust waitin' for us in a bucket on ice\r\nDamn, I didn't think it'd be that easy\n\n'Cause now you're gettin' ready\n\nI'm just sittin' there watchin' TV\n\nHere you come lookin' like a grown man's dream\n\nDamn, I can't believe, I can't believe\n\n\n\nI talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on\n\nYour playlist you play when you're in the shower\n\nTalked you into taking up my time, making up your mind\n\nSwitching back and forth for an hour\n\nAnd now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song\n\nI'm looking at the fine little dress you got on\n\nDon't get me wrong, girl, I love it\n\nNow I just wanna talk you out of it\n\n\n\nYeah, as cool at it would be\n\nWatchin' people wonder who you are\n\nOh, we should just say we did, we can start with a kiss\n\nAnd pretend we just got back from the bar\n\n\n\nI talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on\n\nYour playlist you play when you're in the shower\n\nTalked you into taking up my time, making up your mind\n\nSwitching back and forth for an hour\n\nAnd now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song\n\nI'm looking at the fine little dress you got on\n\nDon't get me wrong, girl, I love it\n\nNow I just wanna talk you out of it\n\n\n\nYeah, it's a little cold outside\n\nThe music's probably way too loud\n\nTo hear you laugh\n\nAnd there's a look in your eyes\n\nLooks like we ain't leavin' now\n\nGirl, I'm so glad, I'm so glad\n\n\n\nI talked you into slippin' down the hall, baby, turn it on\n\nYour playlist you play when you're in the shower\n\nTalked you into taking up my time, making up your mind\n\nSwitching back and forth for an hour\n\nAnd now you're lookin' like a line from a Vandross song\n\nI'm looking at the fine little dress you got on\n\nDon't get me wrong, girl, I love it\n\nNow I just wanna talk you out of it"
