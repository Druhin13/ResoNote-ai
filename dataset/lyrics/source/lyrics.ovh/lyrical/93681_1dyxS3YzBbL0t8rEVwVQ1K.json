  "lyrics": "Right outside of this one church town\r\nThere's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothing\r\nGot a deed to the land but it ain't my ground\r\nThis is God's country\r\nWe pray for rain and thank Him when it's fallin'\n\n'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money\n\nWe put it back in a plate, I guess that's why they call it\n\nGod's country\n\n\n\nI saw the light in a sunrise\n\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side\n\nGettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'\n\nSaved by the sound of the being found\n\nDixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\n\nThe devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\n\nThis is God's country\n\n\n\nWe turn the dirt and work until the week's done\n\nWe take a break and break bread on Sunday\n\nThen do it all again 'cause we're proud to be\n\nFrom God's country (Yeah)\n\n\n\nI saw the light in a sunrise\n\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side\n\nGettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'\n\nSaved by the sound of the being found\n\nDixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\n\nThe devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\n\nThis is God's country\n\n\n\nI don't care what my headstone reads\n\nOr what kind of pine wood box I end up in\n\nWhen it's my time landing 6 feet deep in\n\nGod's country\n\n\n\nI saw the light in a sunrise\n\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side\n\nGettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'\n\nSaved by the sound of the being found\n\nDixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\n\nThe devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\n\nThis is God's country\n\n\n\nYeah, I saw the light in a sunrise\n\nSittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side\n\nGettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'\n\nSaved by the sound of the being found\n\nDixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound\n\nThe devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around\n\nThis is God's country"
