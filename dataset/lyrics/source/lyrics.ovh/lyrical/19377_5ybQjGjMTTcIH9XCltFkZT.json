  "lyrics": "You said you knew the but way\r\nI followed you but I don't like where it got me\r\nSo trust me when I say it yes I mean it\r\nThis is the truth there's no fine line in between it\r\nTrust me I got nothing to lose! Trust me I got nothing to lose!\n\nLet go let go\n\nLet's go let's go\n\nLet go let's go\n\nI got nothing to lose\n\n\n\nIt's easy to choose when you've got nothing to lose!\n\nSometimes it seems so different\n\nBut for no reason my thoughts become indifferent\n\nNow for too long I've lost my bearing\n\nI pull inside but can't stop the rip and tearing\n\nTrust me I've got nothing to lose! Trust me I've got nothing to lose!\n\n\n\nSo hard to live, so hard to breathe, so hard to smile, nothing to lose!\n\nI hate the world, I hate my life:, I hate myself, nothing to lose!\n\nWhy can't I laugh, why can't I love, why can't I feel, nothing to lose!\n\nThis ain't no threat, this ain't a ploy, it's just a fact, nothing to lose!\n\nIt's easy to choose cause I've got nothing to lose! Nothing to lose\n\n\n\nI got nothing to lose! ain't got nothing to lose!\n\nIt's easy to choose when you've got nothing to lose!\n\nHard life no I don't think so\n\nA different time and it's just the way that things go\n\nMaybe I got it all wrong\n\nI shouldn't care about their problems I'll just stay strong\n\nIt's easy to choose cause I've got nothing to lose!"
