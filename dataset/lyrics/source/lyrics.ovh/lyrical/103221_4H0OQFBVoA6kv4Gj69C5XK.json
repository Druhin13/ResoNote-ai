  "lyrics": "I've never been good at change\r\nIf I'm honest, it's always scared me\r\nBut I can't deny this stirring deep inside me\r\nNow I know it's time to stop resisting\r\n'Cause I'm not getting any younger\n\nFear is a such a sad way to live a life\n\nSo face to the wind, I'm jumping out, I'm walking in\n\nEvery single thing You want to show me\n\n\n\nTo the ups and downs, the highs and lows\n\nThe taking in, the letting go\n\nTo tears and laughter, the great unknown\n\nTo the open journey, into faith, I go\n\nInto faith, I go\n\n\n\nNobody said this would be easy\n\nAnyone who did never went through anything painful\n\nBut faith is not some fragile thing that shatters when we walk through something hard\n\nSo, we walk on whatever may come\n\n\n\nTo the ups and downs, the highs and lows\n\nThe taking in, the letting go\n\nTo tears and laughter, the great unknown\n\nTo the open journey, into faith, I go\n\nRunning like a child in an open field\n\nStepping off the edge, I'm facing all my fears\n\nIf this is what it feels like to be born again\n\nI'll be born again\n\n\n\n\n\nSo when I feel like giving up\n\nWhen I feel like throwing it all away\n\nI look back over my shoulder\n\nAnd I can see Your goodness every single step that I have taken\n\nAnd it beats like a drum\n\nAnd it rings like a bell\n\nAnd it sings like a choir\n\nAnd it's leading me on my way\n\nOh, You lead me on my way\n\n\n\nTo the ups and downs, the highs and lows\n\nThe taking in, the letting go\n\nTo tears and laughter, the great unknown\n\nTo the open journey, into faith, I go\n\nInto faith, I go\n\nInto faith, I go"
