  "lyrics": "You can break down my lights and my doors\r\nBut I won't let you back in no more, no more\r\nI'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again\r\nFive nights, it shouldn't seem so long\r\nBut it takes forever when you go all about it wrong\n\nThese halls are lined with blood I can't have on my hands\n\nThese walls, they seem to call my name\n\nBut I refuse to be another puppet in your game\n\nYour eyes are dead inside, but tonight I leave alive\n\n\n\nYou can break down my lights and my doors\n\nBut I won't let you back in no more, no more\n\nI'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again\n\nTie me up, put me into a suit\n\nBut I'll never ever be like you, no\n\nI know what happened here and you can't erase your past\n\n\n\nDone what I can to try to hide\n\nBut even you can tell who I really am inside\n\nIt's not my job to watch you\n\nI'm leaving here tonight\n\nBut maybe one day you'll find humanity\n\nUntil then don't you dare say that we are the same\n\n\n\nYou can break down my lights and my doors\n\nBut I won't let you back in no more, no more\n\nI'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again\n\nTie me up, put me into a suit\n\nBut I'll never ever be like you, no\n\nI know what happened here and you can't erase your past\n\n\n\nAnd I crave the light of day\n\n'Cause I've been keeping you away\n\nIt's driving me insane\n\nIt's driving me insane\n\n\n\nYou can break down my lights and my doors\n\nBut I won't let you back in no more, no more\n\nI'm sick of getting stuck in the same routine again\n\nTie me up, put me into a suit\n\nBut I'll never ever be like you, no\n\nI know what happened here and you can't erase your past\n\n\n\nMaybe one day you'll find humanity"
