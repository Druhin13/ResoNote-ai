  "lyrics": "When there's no comfort in comfortable\r\nStolen chances and color coats\r\nYou can't invest with your full heart\r\nYou feel it crumble before you start\r\nThe path you didn't take, it always ends\n\nPerfect only cause you never did\n\nThe moments that we have will soon be gone\n\nEither you're here or you're not\n\nYou're here or you're not\n\n\n\nA floating fire's hard to hold\n\nA fingers pass right through its glow\n\nThere's piece out there somewhere in time\n\nBut I'm as real as you will find\n\n\n\nThe path you didn't take, it always ends\n\nPerfect only cause you never did\n\nThe moment that we have is almost done\n\nEither you're here or you're not\n\nYou're here or you're not\n\n\n\nThe path you didn't take, it always ends\n\nPerfect only cause you never did\n\nThe moment that we have is almost gone\n\nEither you're here or you're not\n\nYou're here or you're not"
