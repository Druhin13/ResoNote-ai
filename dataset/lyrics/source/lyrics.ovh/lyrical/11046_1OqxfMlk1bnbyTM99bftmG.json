  "lyrics": "Up in the rainbow teepee sky\r\nNo one's looking down on you or I\r\nThat's just a mirror in your eye\r\nAin't taken my last hit yet\r\nI know that things are different now\n\n(I see the same old signs, but something new is growing)\n\n\n\nDon't think I'll cash it in yet\n\nDon't think I'll put down my last bet\n\n(I'm gonna keep my hand in, because something new is growing)\n\n\n\nThink I'll hit the Peace Trail\n\nTake a trip back home to my old town\n\n'Cause everyone back there says\n\nSomething new is growing\n\n\n\nUp in the rainbow teepee sky\n\nNo one's looking down on you or I\n\nIt's just a mirror in our eye\n\n\n\nIf I believe in someone\n\nI have to believe in myself\n\n(I have to take good care when something new is growing)\n\n\n\nThe world is full of changes\n\nSometimes all these changes make me sad\n\n(I have to plant them seeds, till something new is growing)\n\n\n\nI think I'll hit the Peace Trail\n\nI know that treasure takes its time\n\n(I have to take good care when something new is growing)\n\n\n\nI think I'll hit the Peace Trail\n\nI think I like my chances now\n\n(I have to take good care when something new is growing)\n\n\n\nI think I'll hit the Peace Trail\n\nI think I'll hit the Peace Trail now\n\nBecause something new is growing"
