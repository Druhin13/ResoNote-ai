  "lyrics": "I can still remember\r\nThe words and what they meant\r\nAs we etched them with our fingers\r\nIn years of wet cement\r\nThe days blurred into each other\r\nThough everything seemed clear\n\nWe cruised along at half speed\n\nBut then we shifted gears\n\n\n\nWe ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns\n\nBut even then we should have stayed\n\n\n\nBut we ran away\n\nNow all my friends are gone\n\nMaybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved\n\nRunaway\n\nBut what are we running from?\n\nA show of hands from those in this audience of one\n\nWhere have they gone?\n\n\n\nIdentities assume us\n\nAs nine and five add up\n\nSynchronizing watches\n\nTo the seconds that we lost\n\nI looked up and saw you\n\nI know that you saw me\n\nWe froze but for a moment\n\nIn empathy\n\n\n\nI brought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug\n\nYou gave my emptiness a name\n\n\n\nBut you ran away\n\nNow all my friends are gone\n\nMaybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved\n\nRunaway\n\nBut what are we running from?\n\nA show of hands from those in this audience of one\n\nWhere have they gone?\n\n\n\nWe're all okay, until the day we're not\n\nThe surface shines, while the inside rots\n\nWe raced the sunset and we almost won\n\nWe slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on\n\n\n\nWe ran away\n\nNow all my friends are gone\n\nMaybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved\n\nRunaway\n\nBut what are we running from?\n\nA show of hands from those in this audience of one\n\nWhere have they gone?"
