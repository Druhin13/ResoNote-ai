  "lyrics": "Religious iconography giving you the creeps\r\nI feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek\r\nThe rise of the machines\r\nI must admit you gave me something momentarily\r\nIn which I could believe\r\nBut the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved\n\nAnd it's on its way back to scoop you up\n\nNot on my watch\n\n\n\nI want to stay with you my love\n\nthe way that some science fiction does.\n\nReflections in the silver screen of strange societies\n\nSwamp monster with a hard on for connectivity\n\nThe ascension of the cream\n\n\n\nMass panic on a not too distant future colony\n\nQuantitative easing\n\nI want to make a simple point about peace and love\n\nBut in a sexy way where it's not obvious\n\nHighlight dangers and send out hidden messages\n\nThe way some science fiction does\n\nThe way some science fiction doed\n\n\n\nI've got the world on a wire in my little mirror mirror on the wall\n\nIn the pocket of my raincoat\n\nSo I tried to write a song to make you blush\n\nBut I've a feeling that the whole thing\n\nMay well just end up too clever for its own good\n\nThe way some science fiction does"
