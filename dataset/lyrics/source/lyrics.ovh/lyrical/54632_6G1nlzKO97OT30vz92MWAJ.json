  "lyrics": "Left in your wake\r\nI can't escape the aftertaste\r\nThe ruins of the life we made\r\nSo much of you still remains\r\nThis ground is stained\n\nOn every corner where you left your trace\n\nI try so hard to fill this space\n\nBut nothing else can take your place\n\n\n\n83 days and I'm still not over you\n\n83 days and I still can't cut you loose\n\n83 days and I don't know why I'm still counting\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of the high before the fall\n\nAre you thinking of the nights you used to call\n\nAre you thinking of the way we had it all\n\nIn the way we were together (together)\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of the plans we made for us\n\nAre you thinking of the way we used to touch\n\nAre you thinking that you maybe said too much\n\nWhen you promised me forever (forever)\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of me? x3\n\nAre you thinking\n\n\n\nOur love ran deep\n\nAnd boy I gave you all of me\n\nBut I was young and so naive\n\n'Cause you were never mine to keep\n\n\n\nI've moved on\n\nTill they're playing me our favourite song\n\nHow quickly my resolve is gone\n\nMakes me realise you ain't done, you ain't done\n\n\n\n83 days and I'm still not over you\n\n83 days and I still can't cut you loose\n\n83 days and I don't know why I'm still counting\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of the high before the fall\n\nAre you thinking of the nights you used to call\n\nAre you thinking of the way we had it all\n\nIn the way we were together (together)\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of the plans we made for us\n\nAre you thinking of the way we used to touch\n\nAre you thinking that you maybe said too much\n\nWhen you promised me forever (forever)\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of me? x3\n\nAre you thinking\n\n\n\nI know I could've done better\n\nI know I would've been settling\n\nAnd I know I will forget it\n\nI just want to know that you think of me\n\n\n\n83 days and I'm still not over you\n\n83 days and I still can't cut you loose\n\n83 days and I don't know why I'm still counting\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of the high before the fall\n\nAre you thinking of the nights you used to call\n\nAre you thinking of the way we had it all\n\nIn the way we were together (together)\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of the plans we made for us\n\nAre you thinking of the way we used to touch\n\nAre you thinking that you maybe said too much\n\nWhen you promised me forever (forever)\n\n\n\nAre you thinking of me? x3\n\nAre you thinking"
