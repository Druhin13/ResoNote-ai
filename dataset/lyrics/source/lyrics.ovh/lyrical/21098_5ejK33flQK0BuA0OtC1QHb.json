  "lyrics": "This is the part where I remember\r\nAll of the things I should forget\r\nThis is the part where I embrace all of the good\r\nAnd the bad thoughts existing in my head\r\nThis is the part where I am proper\n\nThis is the part where I'm just another face\n\nThis is the part where I'm a marathon runner\n\nAnd both my ankles are sprained\n\n\n\nAnd it's hard\n\nSo hard\n\nAnd breathing just makes it worse\n\nAnd it's bad\n\nSo bad\n\nThat it hurts\n\n\n\nThis is the part where I'm in heaven\n\nThis is the part where I ascend\n\nThis is the part where I did cocaine\n\nTo impress every one of my mouth breathing friends\n\n\n\nThis is the part where I am empty\n\nThis is the part where it hurts\n\nThis is the part where I explode and destroy\n\nEverything on this god given earth\n\n\n\nThis is the part where I am ugly\n\nThis is the part where it ends"
