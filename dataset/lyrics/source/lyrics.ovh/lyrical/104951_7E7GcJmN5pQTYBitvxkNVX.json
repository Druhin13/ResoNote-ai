Way back?\r\nNo more running, no more running, no more chasing\n\nNo more running, now I'm running out of patience\n\nCaught up in confusion, need a resolution\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\n\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\n\n\nPlaying with temptation, searching for salvation\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\nCaught up in confusion, need a resolution\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\n\n\nNo more running, no more running, no more chasing\n\nNo more running, now I'm running out of patience\n\nCaught up in confusion, need a resolution\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\n\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\n\n\nNo more running, no more running, no more chasing\n\nNo more running, now I'm running out of patience\n\nCaught up in confusion, need a resolution\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\n\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?\n\nCan we find a way back? Way back?"
