  "lyrics": "Uh\r\nI forgot to call you on your birthday\r\nYou swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah\r\nThere is nothing I can do to fix it\r\nAll you ever asked me for was time, whoa\n\nWhen the lights don't glow the same way that they used to\n\nAnd I finally get a moment to myself\n\nI will realize you were everything I'm missing\n\nAnd you'll tell me you're in love with someone else\n\n\n\nSo can you do me a favor?\n\nIf I pull it together, make it sooner than later\n\nWe won't be here forever, and I realize I waited too long\n\nBut please don't move on\n\n\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\n(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)\n\nYou don't need no one else, oh\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\n\n\nYou just changed your hair and it looks perfect\n\nWish I was the first to let you know\n\nEvery chance I get to make it better\n\nI just find a way to let it go, whoa\n\n\n\nWhen the lights don't glow the same way that they used to\n\nAnd I finally get a moment to myself\n\nI will realize you were everything I'm missing\n\nAnd you'll tell me you're in love with someone else\n\n\n\nSo can you do me a favor?\n\nIf I pull it together, make it sooner than later\n\nWe won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long\n\nBut please don't move on\n\n\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\n(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)\n\nYou don't need no one else, oh\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\n\n\nThe girl or the world? You see, someone gotta lose\n\nI thought that I could have it all, do I really gotta choose?\n\nWhat good is all the cash if it doesn't buy time?\n\nAnd what good is being famous if I'm never on your mind?\n\nNight's fallin', lights glowing\n\nAnd I'm just trying to pay the price owing\n\nAnd I don't want to feel the comfort from my ice showing\n\nAnd I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments\n\nNigga, nice going, is it worth it? That decision\n\n'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision\n\nSo I'ma dust my shirt and fix my pants\n\n'Cause I better look good, girl, if this my chance, I swear\n\n\n\nSo can you do me a favor?\n\nIf I pull it together, make it sooner than later\n\nWe won't be here forever and I realize I waited too long\n\nBut please don't move on\n\n\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\nYou don't need no one else\n\n(You don't need no one, you don't need no one)\n\nYou don't need no one else, oh\n\nYou don't need no one else"
