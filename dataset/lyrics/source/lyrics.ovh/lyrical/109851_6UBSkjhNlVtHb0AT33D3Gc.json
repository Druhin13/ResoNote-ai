  "lyrics": "Today a thousand years\r\nOf strained affection and prayer\r\n\"out beyond ideas of right & wrong is a field\"\r\nWill I meet you there?\r\nWill I meet you there?\r\nThe summer garden blooms\n\nWith autumn soon replaced\n\nAnother harvest moon—\n\nSo many ways to lose\n\nSo many faiths\n\n\n\n'Holy to the LORD' on the bells of horses\n\nSafely on the shore we sank like stones\n\nTo the bottom of a made up ocean\n\n\n\nStanding on the lake shore, Julia\n\nSilent as a seashell, Julia\n\nMagnet of the elk park, Julia\n\nLaid down on the temple floor\n\n\"Send a couple rats,\" said Julia\n\nI'd have done the same thing to you\n\nCoffee and a milk, now Julia\n\nWho do you think needs who more?\n\n\n\nIn case your plan falls through\n\nTo mispronounce my name\n\n(static between me and that Salafi, Yusef)\n\nTo curse You-Don't-Know-Who\n\nAnd bow before the same\n\n(so was the scene at al-Aqsa.)\n\nI'll meet you there\n\n(I have to admit I loved the cut of his pant legs!)\n\nI'll meet you there\n\n(another lovely afternoon for Sūrat al-Kāfirūn)\n\n\n\n'Holy to the LORD' on the bells of horses\n\nSafely on the shore we sank like stones\n\nTo the bottom of a made up ocean"
