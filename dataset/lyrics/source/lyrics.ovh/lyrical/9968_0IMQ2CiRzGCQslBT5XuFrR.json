  "lyrics": "Well, I sleep all day\r\nAnd drink all night\r\nJust give me one good reason\r\nAnd I'll turn out my light\r\nNow I'm terrified\n\nNow I'm terrified\n\n\n\nAnd I've heard all the people\n\nCalling my name\n\nBut they'll never just see just\n\nHow I've changed\n\n\n\nNow I'm terrified\n\nNow I'm terrified\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna' be your boy, I wanna' be your man\n\nBut something's got me wrong inside\n\nAnd I'm looking for the answer I don't understand\n\nAnd, darling, I am terrified\n\nI'm terrified\n\nMaybe I wasn't cut out for this\n\nYou know, I'm terrified\n\nThat maybe I wasn't cut out for this\n\n\n\nWell, it's hard to explain\n\nHow it got this way\n\nAnd people only wanna' know why\n\nI wish I had an answer that would make it okay\n\nBut, the truth is I'm just terrified\n\nAnd I don't need to remember\n\nBut I wanna' forget\n\nCause there's a hole in my head where\n\nI hide my regret\n\nNow I'm terrified\n\nNow I'm terrified\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna' be your boy, I wanna' be your man\n\nBut something's got me wrong inside\n\nAnd I'm looking for the answer I don't understand\n\nAnd, darling, I am terrified\n\nI'm terrified\n\nMaybe I wasn't cut out for this\n\nYou know, I'm terrified\n\nThat maybe I wasn't cut out for this\n\n\n\nYou know, you can come and save me\n\nBut you have to take a risk\n\nCause I'm terrified that maybe\n\nI wasn't cut out for this\n\nI wasn't cut out for this"
