  "lyrics": "Goven me\r\nStorm onto the light\r\nI feel like life's design is a battlefield of mine\r\nMarching on what do we worship for\r\nI see the blood marks on my door\r\nI run, we run, you cannot hide\n\n\n\nWe are diamonds of nature\n\nWe are more than strangers\n\nFighting with eyes closed\n\nWe are lighting up the night\n\nAin't no star that shines so bright\n\nAnd we're all aligned\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\n\n\nI run, we run, you cannot hide\n\nHomesickness of waiting for that call\n\nWill this be the day we fall?\n\nSome the pray for sun to stop\n\nMarching on\n\nMy brothers got my back\n\nI can see some fading along the track\n\nI fight, we fight, there is no end\n\n\n\nWe are diamonds of nature\n\nWe are more than strangers\n\nFighting with eyes closed\n\nWe are lighting up the night\n\nAin't no star that shines so bright\n\nAnd we're all aligned\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple\n\nLove is a temple"
