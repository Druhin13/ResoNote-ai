  "lyrics": "My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean\rMy man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean\rHe's the meanest man that I've ever see\rMy baby wears high peg pants stripes are really yellow\rBaby wears high peg pants stripes area really yellow\rWhen he starts into love me he's so fine and mellow\rLove will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long\rLove will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long\rLove will make you do things that you know is wrong\rDo right baby if you stay home every day\rI'll do right baby if you stay home every day\rYou're so mean and evil I know you're gonna drive me away\rWhy did he leave me why did he have to go\rWhy did he leave me why did he have to go\rWent off and left me baby I loved him so\rI'll be a good wife to you if it means anything to you\rI'll stay home every night and I'll love you\rAnd kiss you every night and one of these days\rIf you're good to me honey one of these day\rIf God is good to me I'll bring you a little burny\rCome back to me baby try me one more time\rCos without your loving I swear I'm gonna lose my mind"
