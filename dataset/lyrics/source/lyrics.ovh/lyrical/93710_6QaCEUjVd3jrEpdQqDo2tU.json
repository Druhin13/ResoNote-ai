  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Some Nights par George Strait\r\n\nShe took off down the road\nTowards Austin, and I lost it\nI heard she wound up in Fort Worth\nNo, I ain't been the same since\nMy heart's as hard as that old Caliche dirt\n\nSome days are better than others\nSome are mothers\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSome days, I don't wanna get up\nI just wanna give up\nAnd don't even get me started on some nights\n\nI guess I could always call her, but why bother?\nHell, she won't pick up that phone\n\nGot no pride left to swallow, so tomorrow\nI'll try again to just move on\n\nSome days are better than others\nSome are mothers\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSome days, I don't wanna get up\nI just wanna give up\nDon't even get me started on some nights\n\nSome days are better than others\nSome are mothers\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSome days, I don't wanna get up\nI just wanna give up\nAnd don't even get me started\nSome days are better than others\nSome are mothers\n\nI ain't even gonna lie\nSome days, I don't wanna get up\nI just wanna give up\nAnd don't even get me started on some nights\nMmm, some nights\n\nShe took off down the road\nTowards Austin, and I lost it"
