  "lyrics": "Never again she said, we should've known\r\nWe should've known, should've known\r\nThough I could've told you that a week ago\r\nA week ago, week ago\r\nBut you used your body, baby\r\nAnd I'm feeling foolish lately\n\nSo let's not pretend like you're not coming home\n\nYou're coming home and you say\n\n\"Run for me, run for me, run\n\nCome for me, come for me, come\n\nDown to the river, down to the river to pray\"\n\n\n\n'Cause if the truth is blind or naked, naked\n\nIt's a losing fight\n\nOh, so if it's love you want then take it, take it\n\nMake it last all night\n\nYou're taking me up, up, up so high\n\nSo if it's love you want then break it, break it\n\nBaby, that's just fine\n\n\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\n\n\nMm, now all of my kingdoms crumble in your eyes\n\nIn your eyes, in your eyes\n\nWatching my body sing, no compromise\n\nA compromise when you say\n\n\"Run for me, run for me, run\n\nCome for me, come for me, come\n\nDown to the river, down to the river to pray\"\n\n\n\n'Cause if the truth is blind or naked, naked\n\nIt's a losing fight\n\nOh, so if it's love you want then take it, take it\n\nMake it last all night\n\nYou're taking me up, up, up so high\n\nSo if it's love you want then break it, break it\n\nBaby, that's just fine\n\n\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\n\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down\n\nYou break me down"
