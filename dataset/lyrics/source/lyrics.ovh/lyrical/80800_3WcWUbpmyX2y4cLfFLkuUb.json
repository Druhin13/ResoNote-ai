  "lyrics": "I've got a twist for our life story\r\nEnd it with a high speed chase\r\nAs the buildings crash before me\r\nBattered by your tidal waves\r\nAnd all along our luck was frozen\n\nSecrets stole the chance we had\n\nAll our lies are interwoven\n\nKeep them whole or watch your back\n\n\n\nFor the finish line is out there waiting on the other side\n\nIs this the finish line that I've been waiting for all my life?\n\n\n\nAs you run and duck for cover\n\nI'm just gonna raise the stakes\n\nYou look like the last of summer\n\nI know winter's on its way\n\n\n\nAnd all along our luck was frozen\n\nSecrets stole the chance we had\n\nAll our lies are interwoven\n\nKeep them whole or watch your back\n\n\n\nFor the finish line is out there waiting on the other side\n\nIs this the finish line that I've been waiting for all my life?\n\nIs this the finish line that I've got waiting on the other side?\n\nIs this the finish line that I've been waiting for all this time?"
