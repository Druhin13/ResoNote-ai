Creeps on Brayden\n\nNo one really likes your dad around\n\n\n\nStay, wait\n\nDoesn't matter what they say, fake\n\nDoesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix\n\nWe can taste what it's like to love\n\n\n\nI'm at the top of my little world\n\nBut I never felt so alone\n\nThe more it seems like I've grown up the more\n\nI've been shrinking in\n\n\n\nI drown myself in material\n\nWaiting for some kind of punishment\n\nBut consequence don't make no sense\n\nWhen there's nobody there who gives a damn\n\n\n\nI don't know you very well\n\nBut they don't have to know that\n\nWe don't have to show that\n\n\n\nNow that's winter's over and you got an apartment\n\nI think about the times when we shaved our armpits\n\nAnd she was gracious\n\nKnew we were wasted\n\nI wish we had more of your mom around\n\nThe big city life is getting busy and hectic\n\nWe should reconnect and have sex in my Lexus\n\nAnd he was racist\n\nExcept for asians\n\nAnd no one really likes your dad around\n\n\n\nStay, wait\n\nDoesn't matter what they say, fake\n\nDoesn't matter if we fake all of it for the sake of a fix\n\nWe can taste what it's like to love\n\n\n\nStay, wait\n\nDoes it matter if I pay? Fake\n\nDoesn't matter if you make me believe you can feel anything\n\nI can vaguely relate to love"
