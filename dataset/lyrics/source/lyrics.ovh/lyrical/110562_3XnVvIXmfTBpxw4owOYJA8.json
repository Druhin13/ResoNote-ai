  "lyrics": "I've been taught how to talk to You\r\nHold it together\r\nMake the bad look better\r\nSay all the words that I'm supposed to\r\nBow my head, say, \"Amen\"\r\nYeah, that'll do\n\nMaking every dead-end look like heaven\n\nLike being okay is the way to reach You\n\n\n\nBut You're not afraid of all the things I feel\n\nSo why am I afraid of being real?\n\n\n\nYou want my tears, every messy word\n\nEvery scar and every fear\n\nYou want all I have\n\nWith no holding back\n\nWhen I'm hurt, at my worst\n\nYou meet me there\n\n'Cause You see the beauty\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\n\n\nYou don't care if it ain't poetry\n\n'Cause all of my edges\n\nThey are a little rough\n\nBut that's all I got to bring\n\n\n\n'Cause You're not afraid of all the things I feel\n\nDon't have to hide the scars that still aren't healed\n\n\n\nYou want my tears, every messy word\n\nEvery scar and every fear\n\nYou want all I have\n\nWith no holding back\n\nWhen I'm hurt, at my worst\n\nYou meet me there\n\n'Cause You see the beauty\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\n\n\nMascara running down my face\n\nDesperate cry in a dark place\n\nYou take me that way\n\nAll of me\n\n\n\nYou want my tears, every messy word\n\nEvery scar and every fear\n\nYou want all I have\n\nWith no holding back\n\nWhen I'm hurt, at my worst\n\nYou meet me there\n\n'Cause You see the beauty\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\nIn my broken prayers!\n\n\n\nMy broken prayers"
