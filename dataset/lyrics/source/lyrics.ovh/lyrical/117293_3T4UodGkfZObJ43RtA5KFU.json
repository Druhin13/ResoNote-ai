  "lyrics": "These days my waves get lost in the oceans\r\nSeven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions\r\nSent up a flare, I need love and devotion\r\nTraded for some faces that I never know, notion\r\nMaybe I should try to find the old me\r\nTake me to the places and the people that know me\n\nTryna disconnect, thinking maybe you could show me\n\nIf there's so many people here, why am I so lonely?\n\n\n\nCan I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\nCan I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\n\n\nGood friends, good friends hard to find, let's face it\n\nBought the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement\n\nMade a couple dollars now and I ain't tryna chase it\n\nKids from Oklahoma, man we don't waste it\n\nI'm just tryna paint the picture for me\n\nSomething I could give a damn about at maybe 40\n\nYears and I'll be ready and willing, be able to edit the story\n\nCause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely\n\n\n\nCan I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\nCan I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\nI can see it in my, see it in my reflection\n\nOh, can I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\n\n\nLonely\n\n\n\nRight now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane\n\nFoot to the floor, I'm searching for the real thing\n\nMet somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame\n\nHead to the clouds sayin'\n\n\n\nIt's like can I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\nCan I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\nI can see it in my, see it in my reflection\n\nOh, can I get a connection?\n\nCan I get, can I get a connection?\n\n\n\nTryna find the old me\n\nLonely"
