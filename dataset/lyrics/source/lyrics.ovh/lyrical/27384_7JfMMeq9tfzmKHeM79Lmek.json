  "lyrics": "You said you use chocolate\r\nWhen you and him take off all your clothes\r\nWhy the fuck you tell me that?\r\nCan't drink that image out of my head\r\nLike a fish\n\nThat's how I drink these days\n\nIt numbs the envy I have\n\nAgainst your tall kind man\n\nHe's so much taller than I ever will be\n\n\n\nYou write me in a stranger's tone\n\nAnd bring him along to my shows\n\nWell, you need etiquette lessons\n\nAnd I need something in my drink\n\n\n\nLike a fish\n\nThat's how I drink these days\n\nIt numbs the envy I have\n\nAgainst your tall kind man\n\nHe's so much taller than I ever will be\n\n\n\nI dream about you four nights a week\n\nCall me romantic\n\nI wish that I could fill his shoes\n\nBut I'm only a 7\n\n\n\nLike a fish\n\nPour me a Guinnessâ„¢ man\n\nShe's probably screwing him now\n\nCan make all the wisecracks in the world\n\nBut I will never be what she wants"
