  "lyrics": "Oh, wanderer\r\nI've been here wondering\r\nIf your brown eyes still have color, could I see?\r\nThat night, that night with those hands, those hands\r\nThat night, that night, oh, galleon ring\n\nWith heart, wild heart, you would sing to me\n\nWasn't I the lady from the other town\n\nTwist of fate would have me sing at your wedding\n\nWith a baby on my mind and your soul in between\n\n\n\nWild heart, young man, goddamn, I never wanted to keep\n\nYour goal is ages out for the end of your story\n\nGive my hand to Jesus when I ran away with you\n\nOh, wanderer\n\nI've been wondering"
