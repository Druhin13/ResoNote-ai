  "lyrics": "I woke up late, my dreams were loud\r\nThey settled down into the kitchen then I win 'em back to bed\r\nI tried to rest, the dreams came back\r\nI couldn't learn all of the lessons that I knew I could've had\r\nAnd once I started, started to think\r\nI got tossed inside a tumbleweed, a many-headed thing\n\nSo I'm here on the other side\n\nFeeling fucked up and bridled inside my own mind\n\n\n\nMy body hurts\n\nI'm overwhelmed\n\nI complain because I want to and it feels so good to yell\n\nI'm overtired, I overfought\n\nMy brain is tired, too much work\n\nNo gain and too much thought\n\n\n\nI'm still fucked up\n\nI'm still in pain\n\nI throw my clothes against the wall\n\nI warp myself like I'm insane\n\nI let it out, I've gotten loud\n\nI feel a little bit better now\n\n\n\nMy body hurts\n\nI'm overwhelmed\n\nIt feels so good to yell\n\n\n\nMy body hurts\n\nI'm overwhelmed\n\nI complain because I want to and it feels so good to yell\n\nI'm overtired, I overfought\n\nMy brain is tired, too much work\n\nNo gain and too much thought"
