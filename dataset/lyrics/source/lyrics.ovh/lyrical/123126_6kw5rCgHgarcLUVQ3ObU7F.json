  "lyrics": "Squaws out on the gulf stream\r\nBig storms comin' soon\r\nI passed out in my hammock\r\nGod I slept 'till way past noon\r\nStood up and tried to focus\r\nI hoped I wouldn't have to look far\n\nI knew I could use a bloody Mary\n\nSo I stumbled next door to the bar\n\n\n\nAnd now I must confess\n\nI could use some rest\n\nI can't run at this pace very long\n\nYes it's quite insane\n\nI think it hurts my brain\n\nBut it cleans me out then I can go on\n\n\n\nSomething about sunday\n\nIt's the most peculiar day\n\nStrollin' down the avenue\n\nThat's known as 818\n\nFeelin' tired that I gotta inspire\n\nI knew that it wouldn't last long\n\nSo all alone I walked back home\n\nSat on the beach and then i made up this song\n\n\n\nAnd now I must confess\n\nI could use some rest\n\nI can't run at this pace very long\n\nYes it's quite insane\n\nI think it hurts my brain\n\nBut it cleans me out then I can go on\n\n\n\nWell the wind is blowin' harder now\n\n50 knots or there about\n\nThere's white caps on the ocean\n\nAnd I am watchin for water spouts\n\nIt's time to close the shutters\n\nIt's time to go inside\n\nAnd all week I'll be in Old Paris\n\nHell that's a mighty long airplane ride\n\n\n\nAnd now I must confess\n\nI could use some rest\n\nI can't run at this pace very long\n\nYes it's quite insane\n\nI think it hurts my brain\n\nBut it cleans me out then I can go on\n\nYes it cleans me out then I can go on\n\nYeah it cleans me out then I can go on"
