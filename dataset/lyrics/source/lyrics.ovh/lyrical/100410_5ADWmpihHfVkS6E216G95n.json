  "lyrics": "Well I woke up\r\nTook a breath, let it out, then I got up\r\nCup of coffe, thinking maybe, could be wrong but\r\nFeeling so much better (better)\r\nDoing alright\r\nI was all in, I was walking in a straight line\n\nFeeling open, finally knowing what it felt like\n\nReally thought I was better (better)\n\n\n\nAlmost made it three whole days\n\nWithout seeing you in every face\n\nThought I was good again, I was good again\n\n\n\nYou pull me back to that feeling\n\nEvery time that I start thinking\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\nGot this way of showing up and\n\nBreaking me with just one touch when\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\n\n\nBack together\n\nBack together\n\n\n\nI remember how it ended\n\nWe were left with only embers\n\nKept me hoping for a moment, for a flicker\n\nThought I'd never get better (better)\n\n\n\nAlmost made it three whole days\n\nWithout seeing you in every face\n\nThought I was good again, I was good again\n\n\n\nYou pull me back to that feeling\n\nEvery time that I start thinking\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\nGot this way of showing up and\n\nBreaking me with just one touch when\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\nI'm almost back, I'm almost back (back together)\n\n\n\nBack together\n\nBack together\n\n\n\nBaby, one day I will change\n\nEverything will fall in place\n\nAnd I'll be good again, I'll be good again"
