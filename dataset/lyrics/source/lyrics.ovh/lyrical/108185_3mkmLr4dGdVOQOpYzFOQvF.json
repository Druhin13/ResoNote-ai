  "lyrics": "Every night I'm lying in bed\rHolding you close in my dreams\rThinking about all the things that we said\rComing apart at the seams\rWe tried to talk it over\rBut the words come out too rough\rI know you were trying\rTo give me the best of your love\rBeautiful faces, loud empty places\rLook at the way that we live\rWasting our time on cheap talk and wine\rLeft us so little to give\rThat same old crowd was like a cold dark cloud\rThat we could never rise above\rBut here in my heart\rI give you the best of my love\r(Chorus) Oh, sweet darlin'\rYou get the best of my love\rOh, sweet darlin'\rYou get the best of my love\rI'm going back in time and it's a sweet dream\rIt was a quiet night, and I would be alright\rIf I could go on sleeping\rBut every morning, I wake up and worry\rWhat's gonna happen today?\rYou see it your way, I see it mine\rBut we both see it slippin' away\rYou know we always had each other, baby\rI guess that wasn't enough, oh\rBut here in my heart\rI give you the best of my love\r(Chorus)"
