  "lyrics": "I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you and feeling like a lost little boy \nIn a brand new town\r\nI'm counting my sheep and each one that passes is another dream to ashes\r\nAnd they all fall down.\r\nAnd as I lay me down tonight\n\nI close my eyes\n\nWhat a beautiful sight\n\n\n\nI'm sleeping to dream about you \n\nI'm so damn tired\n\nOf having to live without you\n\nBut I, I don't mind\n\nI'm sleeping to dream about you \n\nI'm so tired, oh yes I am\n\n\n\nI found myself in the riches\n\nYour eyes, your lips, your hair, you were everywhere out there\n\nBut I woke up in the ditches\n\nI hit the light and I thought you might be here\n\nBut you were nowhere oh love, you were nowhere at all\n\n\n\nAnd as I lay me back to sleep\n\nThis love I pray that I can keep\n\n\n\nI'm sleeping to dream about you \n\nI'm so damn tired\n\nOf having to live without you\n\nBut I, I don't mind\n\nI'm sleeping to dream about you \n\nI'm so tired\n\n\n\nThis is just a little lullaby \n\nTo keep myself from crying, myself\n\nI need a lullaby to keep keep\n\nMy eyes from always crying and\n\nThis is just a little lullaby\n\nI'm trying to keep myself from falling asleep, sleep\n\nIt's just a little lullaby \n\nSo I don't cry myself to sleep at night\n\n\n\nI'm sleeping to dream about you \n\nI'm so damn tired\n\nOf having to live without you\n\nBut I, I don't mind\n\nI'm sleeping to dream about you \n\nI'm so tired\n\nOh so tired\n\nI'm so tired"
