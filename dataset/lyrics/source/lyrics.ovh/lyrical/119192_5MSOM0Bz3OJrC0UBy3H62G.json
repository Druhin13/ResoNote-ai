  "lyrics": "Someday I won't be afraid of my head\r\nSomeday I will not be chained to my bed\r\nSomeday I’ll forget the day he left\r\nBut surely not today\r\nOne day I won't need a PhD\r\nTo sit me down and tell me what it all means\n\nMaybe one day it'll be a breeze, ah\n\nBut surely not today, but surely not today\n\n\n\nOh, you don’t know what sadness means\n\n'Til you're too sad to fall asleep\n\nOne day I'll be snoozing peacefully\n\nBut surely not today, surely not today\n\n\n\nOne day I'll swear the pain will be a blip\n\nI'll have the hardest time recalling it\n\nI'll be the king of misery management\n\nBut surely not today\n\nOne day that song won't make me cry anymore (Oh no no)\n\nOne day I’ll get up off the bathroom floor (Hey, yeah)\n\nOh, piece by piece I’ll be restored\n\nBut surely not today, surely not\n\nEh, not today\n\n\n\nOh, you don't know what happy means\n\nIf it’s only in your dreams\n\nI'll be acquainted with my jollities\n\nBut surely not today, yeah, surely not today\n\n\n\nSurely not-, surely, surely not-\n\nSurely not-, surely not today\n\n\n\nOne day the thought of him won't hurt the same\n\nWon't need distractions to get through the day\n\nI guess I hope I’m gonna be okay\n\n'Cause I'm not today"
