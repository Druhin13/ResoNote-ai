  "lyrics": "We climbed the peak\r\nSearching for stars\r\nPapier-mâché mind\r\nI painted scars\r\nShivering alone\n\nThe grass isn’t glowing\n\nYou coddled my mind, like it covers my heart\n\nCovers my soul\n\n\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home and leave, leave, leave\n\nThis home, this home, this home\n\n\n\nAlong the moors\n\nMy soul feels safe\n\nSafe from the walls, built in this place\n\n\n\nTeach me to grow\n\nMy scars are undone\n\nRepairing myself\n\nAs I let myself go\n\nAs I let myself go\n\n\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home\n\nOh, take me home and leave, leave, leave\n\nThis home, this home, this home"
