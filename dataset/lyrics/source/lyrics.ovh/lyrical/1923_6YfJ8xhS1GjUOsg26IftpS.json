  "lyrics": "Feelings are strange\r\nespecially when they come true\r\nand I had a feeling\r\nyou'd be leaving soon\r\nso I tried to rearrange\r\nall my emotions\n\nbut it seems the same\n\nno matter what I do.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nBlue umbrella\n\nrest upon my shoulder\n\nhide the pain\n\nwhile the rain\n\nmakes up my mind\n\nwell, my feet are wet\n\nfrom thinking this thing over\n\nand it's been so long\n\nsince I felt the warm sunshine\n\njust give me one good reason\n\nand I promise I won't ask you any more\n\njust give me one extra season\n\nso I can figure out the other four.\n\n\n\nDay time\n\nmakes me wonder why you left me\n\nnight time\n\nmakes me wonder what I said\n\nnext time\n\nare the words I'd like to plan on\n\nbut, last time\n\nwas the only thing you said.\n\n\n\nChorus:"
