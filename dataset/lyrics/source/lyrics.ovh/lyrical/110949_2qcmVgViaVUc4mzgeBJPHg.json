  "lyrics": "You take-a-take and you a-gave-gave-gave what you get \nAnd you'll make, make, make and you'll pretend what you forget \nYou never take time, no, you'll never take mine \nBut if you don't, you could be getting, you'll be getting again \nIf you don't, you will be getting, you'll be getting again \n\nIf you don't, you will be getting, you'll be getting again \n\nAnd would you want, you won't be on time \n\n\n\nYou cross the street, you got the feelin' on me\n\nYou never listened to the reason, you tell to me \n\nYou never listened to time, you never build up the times \n\n\n\nYou never listen, you will get, you get, you get what you get \n\nYou never listen, you will get, you get, you get what you get \n\nYou never listened beyond the time \n\n\n\nAnd on the street, they're all talkin' 'bout the things you should listen \n\nAnd on the news, they're always excusin'\n\nAnd when you tell your friends what you think you ever \n\nAnd, no, there's nothin' like time, to teach you where you have been \n\nAnd there is nothing like time, to give you things you can need \n\n\n\nBut when you listen to the rhythm of the movements that's right \n\nAnd you've been tellin' me, always tell me right \n\nIt's not nothin' I know, it's just somethin' outside \n\nYou always listen your way, but you take time to get what you want \n\nAnd you tell me it's time I am wrong \n\nAnd you will live in this world, and you'll get what you get \n\nAnd you get what you get, and you will get what you get \n\n\n\nBut when you tell me there's another time \n\nAnd when you tell me there's another time \n\nI won't remember what you're tellin' me it's time \n\nI won't forget, I won't forget, I won't forget that it's time \n\n\n\nIt's time, you get what you get (time)\n\nYou get what you get, you get, you get, you get what you get (time)\n\nAnd you'll know when it's time, you'll get it all on yourself (time)\n\nYou'll get it again, you will be getting again (time)\n\nOn time, you'll get what you get (time)\n\nTime, you get what you get (time)\n\nWhen you take time You get what you get, you get what you get"
