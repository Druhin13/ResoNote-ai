  "lyrics": "She's got an alligator bag\r\nTop hat to match\r\nDressed in black on black\r\nShe's got a Philipino girlie\r\nShe claims is her friend\r\nI tell you boys, you just gotta laugh\n\nNow I used to call her Cindy\n\nShe changed her name to \"Sin\"\n\nI guess that's the name of her game\n\nI really used to love her\n\nThen, the kitty she discovered\n\nIt's got to be a sexual thing\n\n\n\nAll, all around the world\n\nGirls will be girls\n\nIt's the same ol', same ol' situation\n\nIt's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain\n\nI say no no no\n\nNo no no Introduced me to her lover\n\nIn a cellophane dress\n\nThen they bid me a sweet fairwell\n\nLast time I saw them\n\nThey were kissing so softly\n\nTo the sound of wedding bells\n\n\n\nAll, all around the world\n\nGirls will be girls\n\nIt's the same ol', same ol' situation\n\nIt's the same ol', same ol' ball and chain\n\nJust like a punch in the teeth\n\nOr a swan dive to the street\n\n\n\nNo, no, no\n\nNo, no, no\n\nIf it wasn't for bad luck\n\nI'd have no luck at all"
