  "lyrics": "Try shifting the weight from the throat\r\nGrasp dense as ceramic\r\nThese rough hands could start a fire\r\nExfoliate the day\r\nIt's a tough pill to swallow\r\nWhen the pillow feels like stone\n\nWish I could hibernate\n\nBut I'd lose what's at stake\n\nIt's getting easier with time\n\n\n\nI just don't have the stomach\n\nTo swallow what I think is hopeless\n\nIn a few years we'll be laughing\n\nTake a few years to view the world\n\n\n\nMy veins have a fury that's churning\n\nMy lungs have a fire that's burning\n\nMean I can't, means I won't go hungry\n\nIt means I can't starve\n\n\n\nFree the moths 'cause they are tired\n\nOf filling pocket space\n\nWrite a memoir on a napkin\n\nI Wish I could Hibernate\n\nBut I'd lose what's at stake\n\nIt's getting easier with time\n\n\n\nI just don't have the stomach\n\nTo swallow what I think is the new world\n\n\n\nMy veins have a fury that's churning\n\nMy lungs have a fire that's burning\n\nMean I can't, means I won't go hungry\n\nIt means I can't starve\n\n\n\nTry shifting the weight from the throat\n\nGrasp dense as ceramic\n\nI just don't have the stomach\n\nTo swallow what I think is hopeless\n\n\n\nMy veins have a fury that's churning\n\nMy lungs have a fire that's burning\n\nMean I can't, means I won't go hungry\n\nIt means I can't starve"
