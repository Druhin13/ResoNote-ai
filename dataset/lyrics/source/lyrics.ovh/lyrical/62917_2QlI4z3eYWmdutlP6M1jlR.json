  "lyrics": "Plain gold ring on his finger he wore\rIt was where everyone could see\rHe belonged to someone, but not me\rOn his hand was a plain gold band\rPlain gold ring has a story to tell\rIt was one that I knew too well\rIn my heart it will never be spring\rLong as he wears a plain gold ring\rOh, oh\rWhen nighttime comes a' callin' on me\rI know why I will never be free\rI can't stop these teardrops of mine\rI'm gonna love him till the end of time\rPlain gold ring has but one thing to say\rI'll remember till my dying day\rIn my heart it will never be spring\rLong as he wears a plain gold ring\rPlain gold ring on his finger he wore\rPlain gold ring on his finger he wore\rPlain gold ring on his finger he wore"
