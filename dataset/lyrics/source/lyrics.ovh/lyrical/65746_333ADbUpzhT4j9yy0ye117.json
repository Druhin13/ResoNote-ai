  "lyrics": "I had a dream of you and I\r\nCarried on waves of happiness\r\nOpened my eyes and we're hanging on tight\r\nTo a sinking ship and I'm losing grip\r\nLiving on different frequencies\r\nAnd I see you less frequently\n\nTime after time we just pass in the night\n\nWe're a sinking ship\n\nYou can't let go of it\n\n\n\nSo I'll wait, wait a little longer\n\nYeah, I'll wait with the bruises and scars\n\nAnd I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger\n\n'Cause together, together\n\nIs tearing us apart\n\n\n\nAnd she said \"Look at those cracks, won't you fix them up\"\n\nAnd \"you did this to us, don't you dare give up\"\n\nAnd though, my arms are open\n\nMy heart is shut tight\n\nBut I can't disconnect\n\nWhen I wanna protect you\n\n\n\nSo I'll wait, wait a little longer\n\nYeah, I'll wait with the bruises and scars\n\nAnd I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger\n\nCause together, together\n\n\n\nWe're not living our lives\n\nAnd we're living a lie\n\nAre we just chain and ball?\n\nAll caught up in the tide\n\nIf we're gonna survive, gotta sail on the tides\n\nOh no, but until then\n\n\n\nI will wait, wait a little longer\n\nAnd I'll wait with the bruises and scars\n\nAnd I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger\n\n'Cause together, together\n\nI will wait, wait a little longer\n\nAnd I'll wait with the bruises and scars\n\nAnd I'll wait 'til you're a little stronger\n\n'Cause together, together\n\n'Cause together, together\n\nIs tearing us apart"
