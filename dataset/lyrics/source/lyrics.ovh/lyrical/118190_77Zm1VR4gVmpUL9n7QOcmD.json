  "lyrics": "Main line\r\nUnderneath the skin of the grape-vines\r\nSave time, serpent, no need to hiss\r\nFound a reason to live, doubt can be in abyss\r\nKeep fallacies off your lips, see casualties in the wind, uh\r\nWe got the ren and remembrance\n\nGalaxies a distance, between us by Christmas\n\nNow we crumbling, leaf over tree pre-twists\n\nYou heart skip a beat when you see me next\n\nWe stretch harshly, I see y'all weaves stretched\n\nParsley in your bean, we hard to get involved\n\nIn the blistering cold, watching \"The Harder They Come\"\n\nHarder they fall, figured niggas was bold\n\nThey proved me wrong quick\n\nLong trip, sifting through memories over dumb spliffs\n\nYoung mit, flung soliloquies of the tongue-tip, uh\n\nWorth it"
