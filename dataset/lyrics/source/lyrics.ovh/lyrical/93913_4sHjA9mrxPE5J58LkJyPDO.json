  "lyrics": "I've been to Paris, made my way down to Rome\r\nSeen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico\r\nBut I could care less, 'cause I was all alone\r\nAnd there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone\r\nI've been all around the world, done all there is to do\n\nBut you'll always be the home I wanna come home to\n\nYou're a wild night with a hell of a view\n\nThere ain't no place, ain't no place like you\n\nThere ain't no place, ain't no place like you\n\n\n\nYou're my daybreak, you're my California sun\n\nYou're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one\n\nIn the city, the country, the mountains or sea\n\nWherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be\n\n\n\nI've been all around the world, done all there is to do\n\nBut you'll always be the home I wanna come home to\n\nYou're a wild night with a hell of a view\n\nThere ain't no place, ain't no place like you\n\nThere ain't no place, ain't no place like you, no\n\n\n\nThere ain't no place (No place, no place)\n\nOoh, yeah, ain't no place\n\nWherever you are, baby, that's where I wanna be\n\n\n\nI've been all around the world, done all there is to do\n\nBut you'll always be the home I wanna come home to\n\nYou're a wild night with a hell of a view\n\nThere ain't no place, ain't no place like you\n\nThere ain't no place, ain't no place like you\n\nSaid there ain't no place, ain't no place like you, yeah\n\n\n\nThere ain't no place (No place, no place)\n\nNo place\n\nThere ain't no place like\n\nNo place like you\n\nNo place, no place, no place, no place\n\nThere ain't no place, no place like you"
