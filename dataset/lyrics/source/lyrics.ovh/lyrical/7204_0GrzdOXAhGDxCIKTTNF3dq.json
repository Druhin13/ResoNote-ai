  "lyrics": "Can you give me something?\r\nTonight, I'm so alone\r\nThe moon is upside down, hanging on a telephone\r\nBut I remember every little bad dream\r\nEvery pretty slow dance\n\nSo can I pick you up later? (When your temperature's better)\n\nIf you need a little shelter (Be your cool operator)\n\nKeep it all quiet, yeah (Just a little louder)\n\nLet the night wind you down, baby, down\n\n\n\nAnd she smiles, how 'bout that?\n\nI was just about to jump before you called me back\n\nAnd you know the pain comes home\n\nAnd the whispers come to call me in my bed when I'm alone\n\nAnd I've lost so much more than I ever had\n\nNow my name is the night, honey, color me black\n\nC-color me black\n\n\n\nCan I take you somewhere?\n\nWould it make a difference?\n\nLike pretty roses on a deathbed\n\nBut I remember you in your white dress\n\nIn your mama's hands\n\n\n\nSo can I pick you up later? (When your temperature's better)\n\nIf you need a little shelter (Be your cool operator)\n\nKeep it all quiet, yeah (Just a little louder)\n\nLet the night wind us down, baby, down\n\n\n\nAnd she smiles, how 'bout that?\n\nI was just about to jump before you called me back\n\nBut you know the pain comes home\n\nAnd the whispers come to call me in my bed when I'm alone\n\nAnd I've lost so much more than I ever had\n\nNow my name is the night, honey, color me black\n\nC-color me black\n\n\n\nAnd how long, how long until you believe that part of me is gone?\n\nWith your sweet, naive kiss\n\nWell I used to feel the same until I let the darkness in\n\nAnd it cost me nothing, baby, nah nothing more than this\n\nNothing more than this useless heart in my chest\n\nNothing that I needed, nothing I regret\n\nNothing that I needed, and I'd do it all again\n\nI'd do it all again\n\n\n\nAnd she smiles, how 'bout that?\n\nI was just about to jump before you called me back\n\nBut you know the pain comes home\n\nAnd the whispers come to call me in my bed when I'm alone\n\nSinging, \"Ooh, not just yet\"\n\nWhen I go, I'll be going out in flames and fiery wrecks\n\nAnd the quiet to me, such an ominous sound\n\nSaid my name is the nighttime now\n\nYes, the quiet to me, such an ominous sound\n\nAnd my name is the night, honey, color me black"
