  "lyrics": "If I could stick my pen in my heart \nAnd spill it all over the stage \nWould it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya \nWould you think the boy is strange? Ain't he strange? \nIf I could win ya, if I could sing ya \nA love song so divine \n\nWould it be enough for your cheating heart \n\nIf I broke down and cried? If I cried? \n\nI said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it \n\nI know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do \n\nOh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it \n\nI said can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely? \n\nIf I could stick a knife in my heart \n\nSuicide right on stage \n\nWould it be enough for your teenage lust \n\nWould it help to ease the pain? Ease your brain? \n\nIf I could dig down deep in my heart \n\nFeelings would flood on the page \n\nWould it satisfy ya, would it slide on by ya \n\nWould ya think the boy's insane? He's insane \n\nI said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it \n\nI said I know it's only rock'n roll but I like it, like it, yes, I do \n\nOh, well, I like it, I like it, I like it \n\nI said can't you see that this old boy has been a lonely? \n\nAnd do ya think that you're the only girl around? \n\nI bet you think that you're the only woman in town \n\nI said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it \n\nI said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it \n\nI said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, I said I know it's only rock 'n roll but I like it, , like it, yes, I do \n\nOh, well, I like it, I like it. I like it..."
