  "lyrics": "We were kids, we played with matches\r\nWell we grew up, we started bands\r\nYeah we skipped school, but played the dances\r\nWhen we started making fans\r\nWe blew off college, toured the country in a van\n\nSometimes at the grocery store, the people say they knew me back when\n\n\n\nWe were teenage rockstars\n\nMade our hometown proud\n\nWhen we were teenage rockstars\n\nWe taught ourselves to play\n\nAnd we played loud\n\n\n\nWe signed a deal and made some records\n\nSold out shows and married young\n\nThe money came, we started fighting\n\nWe partied hard, and had our fun\n\n\n\nWe blew off deadlines and forgot to call our friends\n\nSometimes at the shopping mall, the people say they knew me back when\n\n\n\nWe were teenage rockstars\n\nMade our fathers proud\n\nWhen we were teenage rockstars\n\nWe taught ourselves to play\n\nAnd we played loud\n\n\n\nNow I sit at this piano\n\nI watch my daughter in the yard\n\nI think about those days in high school\n\nMy best friend playing his guitar\n\n\n\nIn my parents' living room, where all of this began\n\nAnd when I leave the shows these days, the people say they knew me back when\n\n\n\nWe were teenage rockstars\n\nSo young and so strung out\n\nWhen we were teenage rockstars\n\nWe taught ourselves to play\n\nWe took the stage\n\nAnd we played loud"
