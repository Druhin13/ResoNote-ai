They're still dirty!\n\n\n\nLook at me now\n\nHow far I've come, I hope that you're proud\n\nI'll put my feet back on the ground\n\nAnd I'm coming down from above the clouds\n\nLook at me now\n\nHow far I've come since I've taken off this crown\n\nI'll put my feet back on the ground\n\nAnd I'm coming down, right here and now\n\nLook at me now\n\nLook at me now\n\n\n\nYou're breaking into pieces\n\nIt's amazing, and now you feel it\n\nTo change me, it'll take you\n\nAll the hate and that's part of me"
