  "lyrics": "Before you judge me take a good hard look at yourself\r\nYou don’t know me but you’re draining me of mental health\r\nA lie based on popular opinion\r\nI want to die ’cos’ I can’t be forgiven\r\nLocked in a room\n\nVoid of humanity\n\nI’m in a black hole\n\nSuffering endlessly\n\nOpening my eyes is worse than death\n\nThat’s why I keep on holding my breath\n\n\n\nThe world is caving in all around me\n\nI see myself as a vulgar monstrosity\n\nMy mind collapsed into a technical mess\n\nI can’t deal with the guilt that I have to ingest\n\n\n\nLocked in a room\n\nVoid of humanity\n\nI’m in a black hole\n\nSuffering endlessly\n\nOpening my eyes is worse than death\n\nThat’s why I keep on holding my breath\n\n\n\nOpening my eyes worse than death …\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\n\n\nWorse than death …\n\nHolding my breath\n\nHolding my breath\n\n\n\nOpening my eyes worse than death …\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath\n\nWhy I keep on holding my breath"
