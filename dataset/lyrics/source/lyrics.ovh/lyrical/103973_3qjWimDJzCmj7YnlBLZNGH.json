  "lyrics": "I wouldn't be who I am, without you\r\nI wouldn't sing the way I sing, without you\r\nYou fill my eyes up with color\r\nAnd you'll always be my mother\r\nI wouldn't be who I am\n\nI wouldn't be the son that I am\n\nWithout a father who showed me I can face all the bullies at school\n\nYou taught me how to keep my cool\n\nI wouldn't be who I am\n\n\n\nI wouldn't be the brother I am\n\nWithout a sister who understands my ambitions and dreams\n\nWe always were on the same team\n\nI wouldn't be who I am\n\n\n\nWithout the people\n\nWe don't see no more\n\nAnd all the imperfections on my skin\n\nThe family tree, with its branches around me\n\nOh, I just wouldn't be who I am\n\nI wouldn't be who I am\n\n\n\nI wouldn't be who I am\n\nI wouldn't be who I am\n\n\n\nI wouldn't be the human I am\n\nWithout the friends that let me fly and help me land\n\nOur foundations go deep\n\nI'll always have a place to sleep\n\nI wouldn't be who I am"
