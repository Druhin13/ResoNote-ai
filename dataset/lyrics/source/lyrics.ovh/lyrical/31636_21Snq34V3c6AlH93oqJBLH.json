  "lyrics": "Somewhere there's music\nHow faint the tune\nSomewhere there's heaven\nHow high the moon\nThere is no moon above\nWhen love is far away too\n\nTill it comes true\n\nThat you love me as I love you\n\n\n\nSomewhere there's music\n\nHow near, how far\n\nSomewhere there's heaven\n\nIt's where you are\n\nThe darkest night would shine\n\nIf you would come to me soon\n\nUntil you will, how still my heart\n\nHow high the moon\n\n\n\nSomewhere there's music\n\nHow faint the tune\n\nSomewhere there's heaven\n\nHow high the moon\n\nThe darkest night would shine\n\nIf you would come to me soon\n\nUntil you will, how still my heart\n\nHow high the moon"
