(Yes, you can!)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nWell, I'm gone, gone\n\n\n\nAyy, it's the Bobby Boy, better known as chocolate and vanilla\n\nAin't another iller, I'm the nuke to Godzilla\n\nI feel a sensation, vibration comin' on\n\nWalk up in the spot like a motherfuckin' don\n\nWhat's up with you, shorty? Tryna get to know you\n\nI know we went to school together, that's the old you\n\nNever told you how I felt, I feel I owed you\n\nNever really tried to talk to you because of old dude\n\nBut beautiful, beautiful, beautiful girl\n\nDon't you walk out my world\n\nEverything that the boy feel for you, girl\n\nIt compiles my world\n\n\n\nTell me that you're satisfied\n\nWithout me right by your side\n\nNo, no, please don't run and hide\n\nLet your man give you a ride\n\nNo, no, please don't run and hide\n\nSkippity, bop, bop, na, na, na, na\n\nLa da-da-da, la da-da-da, da da da da\n\n\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!) (Na na na, na na, na na)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nWell, I'm gone (Can I kick it?) (Gone and)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\n\nWell, I'm gone (Gone and)\n\n\n\nWonderful beauty queen\n\nYou're the only one for me\n\nIt don't matter how it seems\n\nBut you can come kick it with me\n\nWell, can I ask you, baby"
