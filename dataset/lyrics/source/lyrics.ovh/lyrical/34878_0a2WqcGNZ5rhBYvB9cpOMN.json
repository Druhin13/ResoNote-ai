  "lyrics": "You know it's always been hard for me\r\nI guess it's easier if I don't see\r\nThat you were never that innocent\r\nAnd I was much more forgiving then\r\nBut then again, who wouldn't be?\n\nAll at once, see I was free\n\nI was preparing for the breakdown\n\nPreparing for the breakdown\n\nI was preparing for the breakdown\n\nPreparing for the breakdown\n\n\n\nIt was the night of the fireworks\n\nWhen I saw that you didn't hurt\n\nAnd all your friends say you're doing well\n\nThey didn't have much to tell\n\n\n\nBut then again, why wouldn't they?\n\nI realized that I couldn't stay\n\nI was preparing for the breakdown\n\nPreparing for the breakdown\n\nI was preparing for the breakdown\n\nPreparing for the breakdown\n\n\n\nHow nice of you to take your time\n\nOut of sight, out of mind\n\n\n\nI was preparing for the breakdown\n\nPreparing for the breakdown\n\nI was preparing for the breakdown\n\nPreparing for the breakdown\n\n\n\nThat you were never that innocent\n\nAnd I was much more forgiving then"
