  "lyrics": "(How's it goin'?)\r\nOnce was a thought inside my head\r\n'Fore I reached thirty I'd be dead\r\nNow somehow on and on I go\r\nI keep on rollin' with the flow\n\n\n\nFolks said that I would change my mind\n\nI'd straighten up and do just fine\n\nAw, but I still love rock and roll\n\nI keep on rollin' with the flow\n\n\n\nWhile guys my age are raising kids\n\nI'm raisin' hell just like I did\n\nI've got a lot of crazy friends\n\nAnd they forgive me of my sins\n\n\n\nSome might be callin' me a bum\n\nBut I'm still out there havin' fun\n\nAnd Jesus loves me, yes, I know\n\nSo, I keep on rollin' with the flow\n\n(Keep on rollin', keep on)\n\n(Keep on rollin')\n\n\n\nWhile guys my age are raising kids\n\nI'm raisin' hell just like I did\n\nI've got a lot of crazy friends\n\nThey forgive me of my sins\n\n\n\nCan't take it with you when you're gone\n\nBut I want enough to get there on\n\nAnd I ain't never growin' old\n\nSo, I keep on rollin' with the flow\n\nI ain't ever growin' old\n\nIf I keep on rollin' with the flow\n\nKeep on rollin', keep on rollin'\n\nKeep on rollin'"
