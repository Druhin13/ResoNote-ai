  "lyrics": "Fate lets you fall into her arms without a word\r\nAnd only the size of your breath that hurts\r\nI'm not one to go to church\r\nBut you made me believe in something more than hurt\r\nI feel like I don't have the words\n\nI feel like I don't have the words\n\nBecause I can't speak\n\nAm I so naive?\n\nI feel like I don't have the words\n\nBecause I can't speak\n\n\n\nOf these words I've tried to recite\n\nThey are close but not quite\n\nOf these words I've tried to recite\n\nThey are close but not quite\n\n\n\nI'm so misunderstood, I'm so misunderstood\n\nI'm so misunderstood, I'm so misunderstood\n\nI don't know what to believe in\n\n\n\nI guess your eyes said enough\n\nI guess your sigh said enough\n\nAll of these words, no they can't express pain\n\nIt's like my life ended, there's not words that I've learned\n\nOh, and these are just words\n\nAnd they can't express pain\n\nThese are just words, oh words\n\nThat can't express the pain, the pain in my soul\n\nSpeak the unspoken\n\nA monster got woken up and now, now I'm in his part\n\n\n\nOf these words I've tried to recite\n\nThey are close but not quite\n\nAlmost impossible to do\n\nReciting the makings of you"
