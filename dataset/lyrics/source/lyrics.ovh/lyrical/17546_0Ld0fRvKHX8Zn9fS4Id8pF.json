  "lyrics": "Miss you\r\nEveryday and every night, this feeling I'd fight\r\nTry as I might but I wont win, I surrender, I'd die\r\nYou are winning here alright\r\nEvery morning when the sun would shine on me\r\nId flash a smile but deep inside\n\nI feel so sad and lonely\n\nI need you here and now\n\nI miss you\n\nIts crazy to pretend that I don't think of you\n\nThe more this feeling just seems to grow and grow\n\nI miss you\n\nOh how much longer can I hold on to\n\nMaybe you can come and tell me that you miss me too\n\nMiss you\n\nAll I want is for this love to last forever\n\nYou walked away, never came back, oh I tried to recover\n\nI can't bear it boy alright\n\nWhen I hear a song that we had used to share\n\nIll try as I might to hide the tears, and when the pain is over\n\nIll wish that you are near\n\nI miss you\n\nIts crazy to pretend that I don't think of you\n\nThe more this feeling just seems to grow and grow\n\nI miss you\n\nOh how much longer can I hold on to\n\nMaybe you can come and tell me that you miss me too\n\nMiss you"
