Have you? Have you? Ha-have you?\n\nNever have I ever took a look at a screen\n\nAnd thought I'd be a better person if I bought what I see\n\nHave you? Have you? Have you? Ha-have you?\n\n\n\nHave you ever been wrong?\n\nHave you ever been right?\n\nHave you ever felt weak?\n\nHave you ever built a person all up in your head\n\nAnd they crumble the second that they speak?\n\nHave you ever been brave?\n\nHave ever been scared?\n\nHave you ever lost your mind?\n\nHave you ever wished you lived in a tomorrow\n\nThat was better than today?\n\n\n\nMmm, I have\n\nMmm, I have\n\n\n\nBut never have I ever took a look at myself\n\nAnd thought I'd be better if I was somebody else\n\nHave you? Have you? Have you? Ha-have you?\n\nNever have I ever took a look at a screen\n\nAnd thought I'd be a better person if I bought what I see\n\nHave you? Have you? Have you? Ha-have you?\n\n\n\nOh\n\nOh, oh-oh\n\nOh\n\nOh, oh-oh\n\nOh (have you, have you, have you)\n\nOh, oh-oh (have you, have you, have you, have you)\n\nOh (have you, have you, have you, have you)\n\nOh, oh-oh (have you, have you, have you, have you)\n\n\n\nBut never have I ever took a look at myself\n\nAnd thought I'd be better if I was somebody else\n\nHave you? Have you? Have you? Ha-have you?\n\nNever have I ever took a look at a screen\n\nAnd thought I'd be a better person if I bought what I see\n\nHave you? Have you? Have you? Ha-have you?"
