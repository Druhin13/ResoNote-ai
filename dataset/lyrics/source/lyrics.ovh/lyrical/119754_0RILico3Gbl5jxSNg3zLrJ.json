  "lyrics": "When hope and love has been lost\r\nAnd you fall to the ground\r\nYou must find a way\r\nWhen the darkness descends\r\nAnd you're told it's the end\r\nYou must find a way\n\nWhen God decides to look the other way\n\nAnd a clown takes the throne\n\nWe must find a way\n\nFace the firing squad\n\nAgainst all the odds\n\nYou will find a way\n\n\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nAnd find faith\n\nWhen you're close to the edge\n\nWith a gun to your head\n\nYou must find a way\n\n\n\nWhen friends are fearing the crowd\n\nAnd they try to divide us\n\nWe must find a way\n\nWe have entered the fray\n\nAnd we will not obey\n\nWe must find a way\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nAnd find faith\n\nWhen they've left you for dead\n\nAnd you can only see red\n\nYou must find a way\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nFind faith\n\nWe won't let them divide\n\nWe will never obey\n\nWe will find a way\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nFaith\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nDig down\n\nFaith"
