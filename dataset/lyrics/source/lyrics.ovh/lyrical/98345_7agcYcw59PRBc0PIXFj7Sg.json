  "lyrics": "And the stars are not holdin' me down with the truth\r\nAnd I'm living life, and I'm usually bruised\r\nAnd I'm breaking heaven\r\nSo I fall while the angels call, but I'm left for dead\r\nAnd I'd call you now, but you're nowhere found\n\nAnd oh, in between, in between again\n\nHeaven won't let me in\n\nAnd I've always been, always been searching\n\n\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nI'll tear 'em all down from the black ceiling\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\n\n\nSky above the earth below, I'm crawling\n\nAy, keep sayin', \"Don't ever stop going\"\n\nFaith to me is faith in me, so I move on forward\n\nAnd I call you now, but you're nowhere found\n\n\n\nAnd oh, in between, in between again\n\nHeaven won't let me in\n\nAnd I've always been, always been searching\n\n\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nI'll tear 'em all down from the black ceiling\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\n\n\nStars are not\n\nThe stars are not breaking me\n\nThe stars are not breaking me\n\nThe stars are not breaking me\n\nAnd I would, I'd climb the sky if I thought that you gave a damn\n\nBut the stars will never hurt me again\n\n\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did\n\nI'll tear 'em all down from the black ceiling\n\nThe stars don't look the same as they did"
