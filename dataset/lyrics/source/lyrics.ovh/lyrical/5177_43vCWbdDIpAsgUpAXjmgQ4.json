  "lyrics": "Time heals, I've been told before\r\nI've been doing well\r\nThree years is enough to forget\r\nThe love we felt\r\nBut you called out of the blue\n\nAnd I'm pulled right back to you\n\n\n\nI forgot what you do to me\n\nHow I wanted you desperately\n\nI've been fine, I haven't had you on my mind\n\nThought it was over when we said goodbye\n\n\n\nMouth dry, all these butterflies\n\nNeed to be strong\n\nIt's time\n\nDo I cut you off or just play along?\n\n\n\nBut you called out of the blue\n\nAnd I'm pulled right back to you\n\n(Why you keep me falling in love?)\n\n\n\nI forgot what you do to me\n\nHow I wanted you desperately\n\nI've been fine, I haven't had you on my mind\n\nThought it was over when we said goodbye\n\n\n\nStruggling to find a little peace of mind\n\nDon't you act like you had no idea, oh no\n\nYou know full well how far I fell\n\nDon't fool me, don't remind me\n\n\n\nI forgot what you do to me\n\nHow I wanted you desperately\n\nI've been fine, I haven't had you on my mind\n\nThought it was over when we said goodbye\n\nI forgot what you do to me (It's over now)\n\nHow I wanted you desperately (It's over now)\n\nI been fine, I haven't had you on my mind (It's over now)\n\nThought it was over when we said goodbye\n\n\n\nThought it was over when we said goodbye\n\nWas it over when we said goodbye?"
