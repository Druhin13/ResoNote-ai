  "lyrics": "Holding on to things I had, I bottle up inside\r\nWanna face my demons but denial makes me high\r\nThought I had it figured out, I guess it was a lie\r\nThought I was a grown-up but I'm really just a child\r\nLookin' back on things I had, I ruin everything\r\nEverything's my fault and it's the bad luck that I bring\n\nMy idea of forever is fleetin' in itself\n\nEveryone I love has an expiration shelf\n\nEveryone I love leaves me when I need them most\n\nMy little heart is broken and the world will pay the cost\n\nSmash my heart in pieces (smash my heart in pieces)\n\nIt looks so good on the floor (it looks good on the floor)\n\nNow I really hate you (you know I hate you)\n\nAnd I wanna hate you more (you know I hate you more)\n\nI will climb a mile for you (I would climb a mile)\n\nIn fact I always did (you know I always did)\n\nYou gave me a fraction of what (gave me a fraction)\n\nI had to give (what I had to give)\n\n\n\nMy eyes are bleeding, I'm sick and still not eating\n\nGot nothing to believe in, I'm not so lucky\n\n\n\nI thought you'd love me\n\nI thought you'd love me\n\nI thought you'd love me\n\nI thought you'd love me"
