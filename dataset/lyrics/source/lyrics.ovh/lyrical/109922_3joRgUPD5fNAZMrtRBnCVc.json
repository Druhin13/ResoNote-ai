  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Youth | Division par Fit For a King\r\n\nThere's a place in the back of my head\nI keep it dark, let no one in\nThere's a heart somewhere in my chest\nIs there a beat? Does it exist?\nWill I ever feel anything?\nWill I ever see the end of my story?\n\n\nI'm so haunted by who I used to be\nA brighter version that I left behind\nWasted my innocence\nSeeing anger with my open eyes\n\nBring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down\n\nBring me back to a life where I wasn't so let down\n\n\nAm I here to live like I'm broken?\nAm I here to lose my way?\nSeparate me from the sorrow\nGive me hope for another day\n\n\nI feel a space in the back of my head\nI don't feel the same, I just feel ashamed\nEveryday pounding in my chest\nLike a tidal wave that I can't escape\n\n\nBring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down\n\nBring me back to a life where I wasn't so let down\n\n\nAm I here to live like I'm broken?\nAm I here to lose my way?\nSeparate me from the sorrow\nGive me hope for another day\n\nI can't turn back time, but I can let it go\nI'm fighting back against the poison in my soul\nI'm fighting back against the poison in my soul\n\n\nBring me back to a time where I didn't tear things down\nBring me back to a life where I wasn't so, wasn't so let down\n\n\n\nAm I here to live like I'm broken?\nAm I here to lose my way?\nSeparate me from the sorrow\nGive me hope for another day, day\nGive me hope for one more day"
