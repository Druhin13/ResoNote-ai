  "lyrics": "You whipped me I'm hurting \nAbused me for certain \nAnd slavery should not exist \nIs this what I get a poison kiss \nWithout you I'm dead meat \n\nI'm a raggedy dog dying in the street \n\nOf a God-forsaken shanty town \n\nWhere gangs of children are hunted down \n\n\n\nI go wild when you're in my face \n\nI go wild when I taste your taste \n\nI go wild and I go insane \n\nI get sick--somebody stop this pain \n\n\n\nYou left me I'm braindead \n\nI'm feeling nothing strapped to my bed \n\nOn life support tubes in my nose \n\nTubes in my arms shot full of holes \n\n\n\nI go wild act like a goat \n\nAnd I get sick, lumps in my throat \n\nI go wild \n\nI go wild \n\nI go crazy, I go insane \n\nI get sick somebody stop this pain \n\n\n\nAnd the doctors says you'll be okay \n\nAnd if you'd only stay away \n\nFrom femme fatales and dirty bitches \n\nAnd daylight drabs and nightime witches \n\nAnd working girls and blue stockings \n\nAnd dance hall babes and body poppers \n\nAnd waitresses with broken noses \n\nCheckout girls striking poses \n\nAnd politicians' garish wives \n\nWith alcoholic cunts like knives \n\n\n\nI go wild \n\nI go wild \n\nI go wild \n\nI go wild \n\nI go wild when you're in my face \n\nAnd I'm entranced in a state of grace \n\nI go wild when you treat me bad \n\nI go wild, raving mad \n\n\n\nI go wild for you \n\nI go wild for you"
