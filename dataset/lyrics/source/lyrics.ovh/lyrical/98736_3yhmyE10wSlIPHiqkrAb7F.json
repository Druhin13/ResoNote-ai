  "lyrics": "Terror creeps like a hurricane, oppressing the seas, trying to sink my vessel\r\nPowerless to the crippling wake, pull me in and destroy my faith With my liquid lungs, I can breathe\r\nFree of broken memories that keep holding on\r\nContemplating love you spent only to feel alone\r\nI feel alone\n\nLove you spent only to feel alone\n\nStill holding on\n\n\n\nA hollow heart holds no peace\n\nCan we forgive and forget, receive and protect, when we carry our prisons in our heads\n\nCarve my legacy into the stone, for my light can only burn so long, but before I go, my brimstone bones will smolder all my fears of the unknown\n\n\n\nFree of broken memories that keep holding on\n\nContemplating love you spent only to feel alone\n\nI feel alone\n\nLove you spent only to feel alone, and no strength to let it go\n\n\n\nIn my wishing well, where all my words turn to stone, speak to me\n\nThrough grit teeth; a broken soul and a heart that wants to take control\n\n\n\nWho's to say whether we should drift\n\nI can feel you slipping away\n\n\n\nShadows unfamiliar to me dance around the walls\n\nOf the most familiar places\n\nNow I've become a stranger in my own home\n\nI'd fall asleep with you next to me\n\nNow everyday I wake alone\n\n\n\nShadows of strangers compose themselves reluctantly\n\nHow can you confront your fears when they stand back to back Trust in a disconnect to make the pieces fit, oh\n\nShadows of strangers\n\nShadows of strangers\n\n\n\nHope you left behind\n\nHome is undefined\n\nHope you left behind\n\nHome is undefined"
