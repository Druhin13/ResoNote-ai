  "lyrics": "It's been a week from hell, I lost my job at Five Guys\r\nMy girl just kicked me out, she says I'm lame\r\nMaybe she's got a point, who gets the sack from Five Guys?\r\nShe thinks I'm so incapable of change\r\nBut I can cut down on my sleep\r\nGive you what you need\n\nTake time and make time, girl\n\nI can stop procrastinating, oh\n\nBe a little more prepared\n\nShow you that I care\n\nI love you, I swear, girl, oh\n\nBut tell me\n\nIf I wasn't broke, ooh\n\nWould you spend more time with me like you said you'd do? Oh yeah\n\nTell me what I'm supposed to do\n\n'Cause the only thing I need is to be loved by you\n\nI'm starting out my seventh day of sofa surfing\n\nParading in my Calvin's with no shame (good lord)\n\nI sit and think to myself, I've hit the low\n\nBut look around and see no one to blame\n\nMaybe I can cut down on my sleep\n\nGive you what you need\n\nTake time and make time\n\nI can stop procrastinating, woah-woah-woah\n\nBe a little more prepared\n\nShow you that I care\n\nI love you, I swear, girl, oh\n\nBut tell me\n\nIf I wasn't broke, ooh\n\nWould you spend more time with me like you said you'd do? Oh yeah\n\nTell me what I'm supposed to do\n\n'Cause the only thing I need is to be loved by you\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nOh-oh\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nOh-oh\n\nIf I wasn't broke, ooh\n\nWould you spend more time with me like you said you'd do? Yeah\n\nTell me what I'm supposed to do\n\n'Cause the only thing I need is to be loved by you, oh\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nOh-oh\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nOh-oh"
