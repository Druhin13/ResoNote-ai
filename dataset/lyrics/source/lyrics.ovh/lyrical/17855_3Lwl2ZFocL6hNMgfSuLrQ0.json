  "lyrics": "Do you ever wonder?\r\nDoes it ever cross your mind?\r\nIf we'd never met\r\nWell I think about it sometimes\r\nI don't remember\r\nWhat those days were like\n\nAnd I don't want to\n\nI don't even wanna try\n\n\n\nThere'd be no stars in my sky, light in my life\n\nBaby, where would I be?\n\nNo fire, no spark, beat in my heart\n\nI wouldn't be me\n\nDon't know what I'd do\n\nIn a world without you, ooh\n\nIn a world without you\n\n\n\nEvery day, the sun would still come up\n\nNothing would change, the world would still turn\n\nAnd I'd say \"I'm doing fine\"\n\nBut I'd be lying 'cause there's only one truth\n\nEverything I am begins and ends with you\n\n\n\nThere'd be no stars in my sky, light in my life\n\nBaby, where would I be?\n\nNo fire, no spark, beat in my heart\n\nI wouldn't be me\n\nDon't know what I'd do\n\nIn a world without you, ooh\n\nIn a world without you\n\n\n\nThere'd be no stars in my sky, light in my life\n\nBaby, where would I be?\n\nNo fire, no spark, beat in my heart\n\n\n\nThere'd be no stars in my sky, light in my life\n\nBaby, where would I be?\n\nNo fire, no spark, beat in my heart\n\nI wouldn't be me\n\nDon't know what I'd do\n\nIn a world without you, ooh\n\nIn a world without you\n\n\n\nIn a world, in a world, in a world without you, ooh\n\nIn a world, in a world, in a world without you\n\nIn a world without you"
