  "lyrics": "All my friends have gone away\r\nSo long to them, but I have to stay\r\nAll my woes and all my lows\r\nWon't change my soul 'cause I have to go\r\nAll my friends have gone away\r\nSo long to them, but I have to stay\n\nAll my woes and all my lows\n\nWon't change my soul 'cause I have to go\n\n\n\nNow my brother was loud, but my brother was proud\n\nAnd my brother made sure that he stood out in a crowd\n\nYeah my brother wore glasses but he saw so clear\n\nAnd my brother knew God so he had no fear\n\nNo fear of these haters, no fear of these clones\n\nMy brother wasn't concerned, and he made that known\n\nYeah my brother was spoiled, but my brother was loyal\n\nLate nights of hard work, me and my brother would tour\n\nYeah my brother made me laugh 'cause my brother was funny\n\nBut you best not ever fuck around with my brother's money\n\n'Cause my brother would snap and then that's all that she wrote\n\nAnd it's a line under that, as my brother would quote\n\nYeah my brother's a mothafucka if I'm tellin' the truth\n\nBut man he kept it 100 in and out of the boot\n\nSo when I talk about my brother, I smile and I cry\n\nBecause I know he's watchin' over me, sittin' on high\n\n\n\nAll my friends have gone away\n\nSo long to them, but I have to stay\n\nAll my woes and all my lows\n\nWon't change my soul 'cause I have to go\n\nAll my friends have gone away\n\nSo long to them, but I have to stay\n\nAll my woes and all my lows\n\nWon't change my soul 'cause I have to go\n\nAll my friends have gone away\n\nSo long to them, but I have to stay\n\nAll my woes and all my lows\n\nWon't change my soul 'cause I have to go"
