  "lyrics": "I'm lying alone with my head on the phone\r\nThinking of you till it hurts\r\nI know you hurt too but what else can we do\r\nTormented and torn apart\r\nI wish I could carry your smile in my heart\n\nFor times when my life seems so low\n\nIt would make me believe what tomorrow could bring\n\nWhen today doesn't really know, doesn't really know\n\n\n\nI'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you\n\nI know you were right, believing for so long\n\nI'm all out of love, what am I without you\n\nI can't be too late to say I was so wrong\n\n\n\nI want you to come back and carry me home\n\nAway from these long, lonely nights\n\nI'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too?\n\ndoes the feeling seem oh, so right?\n\n\n\nAnd what would you say if I called on you now\n\nAnd said that I can't hold on?\n\nThere's no easy way, it gets harder each day\n\nPlease love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone\n\n\n\nI'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you\n\nI know you were right, believing for so long\n\nI'm all out of love, what am I without you\n\nI can't be too late to say I was so wrong\n\n\n\nOoh, what are you thinking of\n\nWhat are you thinking of\n\nWhat are you thinking of\n\nwhat are you thinking of\n\n\n\nI'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you\n\nI know you were right, believing for so long\n\nI'm all out of love, what am I without you\n\nI can't be too late to say I was so wrong"
