  "lyrics": "I was on hold\r\nTired and getting cold\r\nSo I put my love to bed\r\nEverything told\r\nScared to be alone\r\nSo you took my hand and said\n\n\n\nCome inside I’ll make your mind up\n\nAll this pain is gold\n\nCome inside you’ll be surprised at all there’s yet to know\n\n\n\nI was on hold\n\nHigh becoming low\n\nBut it helps to kill my time\n\nOut of control\n\nTied to what I’m told\n\nSo you match your step with mine\n\n\n\nCome inside I’ll make your mind up\n\nAll this pain is gold\n\nCome inside you’ll be surprised at all you have to hold\n\n\n\n\n\nCome inside I’ll make your mind up\n\nAll this pain is gold\n\nCome inside you’ll be surprised at all you have to hold"
