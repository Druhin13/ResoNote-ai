  "lyrics": "Torn flat pages\r\nEncased in a dark binded blanket\r\nBlood stained hand prints\r\nInscription of the bleeding eyes\r\nThat decay as they write\r\nThe scratched sonnets\n\nOf scripted crucifixion\n\nAnd self mutilation\n\n\n\nCrimson words blurred\n\nFrom the tears that fall as the hopeless ramblings are indicted\n\nInto the bland white pages\n\n\n\nInto the dull darkness\n\nAs the light slips away\n\n\n\nTorn flat pages\n\nEncased in a dark binded blanket\n\nThe scratched sonnets\n\nOf scripted crucification\n\n\n\nI reign my realm with the coldest of intention\n\nI show no mercy\n\nNo mercy to those who beg"
