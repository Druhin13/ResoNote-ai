Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\nWhat’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\n\n\nI don’t understand a single word that you say\n\nBaby are you talking to me?\n\nWords that twist around a wire again make\n\nYou send through all your secrets to your heart (this line I’m not sure)\n\n\n\nOh-oh-ooh why\n\nDo we do what we do when we lie?\n\nWe give shape to the struggle\n\n\n\nWhat’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\nWhat’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\n\n\nToo late, too late to tell you I’m gonna build a world around you\n\nToo far, you’re too far away for me to pull you in & show you just what I\n\nI can do with a lover who tries\n\nTo bend with me too-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\n\n\n\nWhat’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\nWhat’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\nWhat’s chasing you? Ooh-ooh-ooh oooh\n\nOoooh. Oooh-ooh-ooh oooh. Oooh-ooh"
