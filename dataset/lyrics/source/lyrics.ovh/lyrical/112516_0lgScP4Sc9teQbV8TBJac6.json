  "lyrics": "Hearts in the cage\r\nHearts in the cage, hearts in the cage\r\nYou flipped the page and slipped away\r\nNever thought that you were someone to say things that you didn't mean\n\n\n\nYou didn't even call or wish me sweet dreams\n\nReally thought we made a sweet team\n\nBut I don't cry, consider this a lullaby\n\nSweet dreams, -eams\n\n\n\nTicking clocks on the wall, waiting for your call\n\nBut that cuckoo bird, don't sing at all\n\n\n\nNever thought you would take everything we had and loved and leave\n\n\n\nYou didn't even call or wish me sweet dreams\n\nReally thought we made a sweet team\n\nBut I don't cry, can't you see that you're love of mine\n\nSweet dreams, always thought you were the sweetest thing\n\nBut I don't cry, consider this a lullaby\n\n\n\nThem sweet dreams, sweet dreams\n\nSweet to me, oh sweet dreams"
