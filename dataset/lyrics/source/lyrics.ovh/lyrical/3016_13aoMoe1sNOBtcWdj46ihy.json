  "lyrics": "Listen to the crunching\r\nMusic of the crashing mopeds all around her\r\nPainted with the burning\r\nPowders of exotic funerals that surround her\r\nChronos feasts on his children\n\nLike turning mango flesh\n\nWill the trouble cease\n\nWhen she pays off the police?\n\n\n\nInfection filled my head\n\nLike springtime flower beds and evaporating trash\n\nPressure in the skull\n\nLike leaking timber hull\n\nMade dreams so wonderful\n\n\n\nChronos feasts on his children\n\nLike turning mango flesh\n\nWill the trouble cease\n\nWhen she pays the pigs off?"
