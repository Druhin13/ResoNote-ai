  "lyrics": "Sorry, you're nothing but an illusion\r\nYou're just a mind projecting our world\r\nWorries are nothing but conclusions\r\nWorries are lies deterring your rebirth\r\nYou are the silent bliss\n\nBehind the abyss of thoughts\n\nOf conscious mind\n\n\n\nSorrow are faces on the mirror\n\nBillions are hearts and names ethereal\n\nYou are the quiet dream\n\nThat's always been before the seeds of time\n\n\n\nShed all the fears\n\nAnd trust the universe\n\nLight of transcendence\n\nThe real perfection\n\n\n\nIt's all in your hands\n\nTo trust the universe\n\nLight of transcendence\n\nThe human conception comes\n\n\n\nA brand new world\n\nConception comes!"
