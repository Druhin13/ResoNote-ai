  "lyrics": "Woo!\r\nWe on a wave, that luxury flow\r\nAnd I don't watch what I say, but I say what I know\r\nDon't wait on me, it's too late for me\r\nI walk with that step, Cali air what I breathe\r\nAnd I've been drinkin' all night, so please excuse me\n\nIf I say what I mean, blame it on the Hennessy\n\nCan't stop, won't stop, baby\n\n\n\nIt's too late, for me\n\nI poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone\n\nIt's too late, for me\n\nI poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone\n\nIt's too late\n\n\n\nDesigner on me, I'm covered in that Gucci\n\nIs that tension in the air? Or, baby, is that just me?\n\nToo strong, I'm gone, yeah\n\nLet me switch this flow up real quick\n\nGo-getter, V for Vendetta\n\nWhatever, I just do better\n\nTrendsetter, search for the cheddar\n\nNo pressure, float like a feather\n\nSmooth dude, big moves\n\nBig trees, like Snooooop\n\nNow I'm back\n\nLet me bring it back to the track, oh, yeah\n\nCan't stop, won't stop, yeah\n\n\n\nIt's too late, for me\n\nI poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone\n\nIt's too late, for me\n\nI poured it too strong, now, baby, I'm gone\n\nIt's too late"
