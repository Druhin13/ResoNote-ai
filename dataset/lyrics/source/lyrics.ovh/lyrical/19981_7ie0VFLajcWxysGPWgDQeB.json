  "lyrics": "Oh, the feeling comes to me again\r\nThe feeling to give up and to give in\r\nThe feeling that I've already lost the war\r\nBut a pure heart is worth waiting for\r\nGet behind me all you little fears\n\nGet behind me all you wasted years\n\nGet behind me everything I've done wrong\n\nA pure heart is coming with the dawn\n\n\n\nI've decided to face this mountain\n\nStare the mountain down between the eyes\n\nI'm not running from this mountain of mine\n\nI've decided to face this mountain\n\nStanding up to the mountain tonight\n\nI believe you could move the mountainside\n\n\n\nShe's a pretty devil in disguise\n\nThe devil's in the details of her eyes\n\nShe's a blurry vision in her dress tonight\n\nHer tongue is mixing drinks like truths and lies\n\n\n\nMaybe faith is found inside a seed\n\nMaybe faith's still found inside of me\n\nMostly I feel like I'm lost at sea\n\nI believe, Lord help my unbelief\n\n\n\nI've decided to face this mountain\n\nStare the mountain down between the eyes\n\nI'm not running from this mountainside\n\nI've decided to face this mountain\n\nStanding up to the mountain of mine\n\nI believe you could move this mountain of mine\n\nI believe you could move the mountainside\n\nI believe you could move the mountain of mine\n\n\n\nMove the mountain of mine"
