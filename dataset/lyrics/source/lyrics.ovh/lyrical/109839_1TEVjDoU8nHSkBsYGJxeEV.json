  "lyrics": "I watched you yesterday\r\nScent of the yellow train\r\nWas ungodly\r\nI swept the hair away\r\nA bead of sweat astray\r\nOn your body\n\nYou never cut the lawn\n\nI never acted on\n\nWhat she taught me\n\nWell now you're catching on\n\nBut you are not alone\n\nIt's ungodly\n\n\n\nI have unfinished business in this life\n\nNot ready to go to the other side\n\nYour immortal lover\n\nWaiting with you left me satisfied\n\nI'll be crossing over to the light\n\nYour immortal lover\n\n\n\nYou held a picture framed\n\nIt's showin' our wedding day\n\nSo closely\n\nYou put it all away\n\nWith nothing else to say\n\nSighs mostly\n\nYou had an empty bed\n\nAsk someone else instead\n\nWith your body\n\nI knew the day would come\n\nI knew that you'd move on\n\nI'll start walking\n\n\n\nI have unfinished business in this life\n\nNot ready to go to the other side\n\nYour immortal lover\n\nWaiting with you left me satisfied\n\nI'll be crossing over to the light\n\nYour immortal lover\n\nI have unfinished business in this life\n\nNot ready to go to the other side\n\nYour immortal lover\n\nWaiting with you left me satisfied\n\nI'll be crossing over to the light\n\nYour immortal lover\n\nI have unfinished business in this life\n\nNot ready to go to the other side\n\nYour immortal lover\n\nWaiting with you left me satisfied\n\nI'll be crossing over to the light\n\nYour immortal lover"
