  "lyrics": "One of us still has our picture taped up on the dash\r\nOne of us took that one from Mexico, threw it in the trash\r\nOne of us don't even notice when the radio plays that song\r\nOne of us breaks down and has to pull over whenever it comes on\r\nNah there ain't no in between, when it comes to her and me\n\nOne of us moved on, one of us got stuck\n\nOne of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk\n\nOne of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night\n\nJust depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine\n\n\n\nThere's a number on a phone that one of us erased\n\nThere's a \"late-night can we try again?\" call one of us wants to make\n\n'Cause one of us can't even think about bein' in another's arms\n\nAnd there's a car in the drive that stayed all night, where one of us used to park\n\n\n\nOne of us moved on, one of us got stuck\n\nOne of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk\n\nOne of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night\n\nJust depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine\n\n\n\nFor a while we had forever in our hands\n\nThat's why one of us can't understand\n\n\n\nHow one of us moved on, one of us got stuck\n\nOne of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk\n\nOne of us sleeps good, one of us hates to face the night\n\nJust depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine\n\n\n\nYeah that's the difference between her world or mine"
