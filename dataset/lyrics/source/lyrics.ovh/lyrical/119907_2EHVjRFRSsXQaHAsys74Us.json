  "lyrics": "Somebody said you got a new friend\r\nDoes she love you better than I can?\r\nAnd It's a big black sky over my town\r\nI know where you at, I bet she's around\r\nYeah, I know it's stupid, I just gotta see it for myself\n\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh\n\nAnd I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh\n\nI'm giving it my all\n\nI'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh\n\nI keep dancing on my own\n\n\n\nI just wanna dance all night\n\nAnd I'm all messed up, I'm so out of line\n\nStilettos on broken bottles\n\nI'm spinning around in circles\n\n\n\nI'm sat in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh\n\nI'm right over here, why can't you see me, ohh\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooo\n\nAnd I keep dancing on my own\n\n\n\nSo far away but still so near\n\nThe lights go on, the music dies\n\nBut you don't see me standing here\n\nI just came to say goodbye\n\n\n\nI'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooo\n\nAnd I keep dancing on my own\n\nSat down in the corner, why do you kiss her?\n\nAnd I'm right over here why don't you see me?\n\nAnd I'm giving it my all\n\nBut I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooo\n\nAnd I keep dancing on my own\n\n\n\nSo far away but still so near\n\nThe lights go on, the music dies\n\nBut you don't see me standing here\n\nI just came to say goodbye"
