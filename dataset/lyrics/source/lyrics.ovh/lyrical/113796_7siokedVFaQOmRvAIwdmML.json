  "lyrics": "Come on, what’s the big deal? Nobody’s that heartless!\r\nSo listen here, I’m the voice in your head\r\nAnd I can say the words that make you feel scared\r\nSo here's to you, and all the problems that we've made\r\nAnd I know it’s so hard to stay afloat\n\nWhen you make monsters out of the thorns\n\nAnd you’re chained up now\n\nAnd everyone in around you is too far away to notice you\n\nJust start to crash, oh, but it's alright\n\nOh, it will be alright\n\nSo just breathe, It's almost over\n\nAnd don’t let the monster in your head\n\nBecome your fears\n\n'Cause you can save yourself, you know\n\nYou know\n\n\n\nSo listen here, I know it’s hard\n\nMaybe I can’t do what you want\n\nBut I’m just who I am, I’m trying to see what you could be\n\nAnd I am still here, the voice in your head\n\nAnd I’ll be there for you, when no one else cares\n\nAnd this is it, the start is where we’ve gotten since\n\nSo no, I got thing, now we got it\n\nI hope you know, know you're not alone\n\n\n\nCome on, what’s the big deal? Nobody’s that heartless!\n\nYou know it’s time\n\nIt’s time to decay"
