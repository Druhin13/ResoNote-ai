  "lyrics": "Over! It must be over right nowâ€¦\r\nNightmare! This nightmare has just begun!\r\nTwo eagles are cruising around over my land.\r\nTwo eagles are trying to break a branch they've already bent\n\nTwo martial birds hunting each other\n\nTwo pairs of wings try to bring a brother up against his brother.\n\n\n\nThe moment when I could hug my friend\n\nIt is forever lost.\n\nAnd now they want us to pay the cost\n\nAnd now they want us to pay the cost!\n\n\n\nWhen two empires collide!\n\n\n\nThe day \"war\" was just a word is gone\n\nThe time when peace was just a children's song is gone.\n\nWe never believed terror would ever burst into our home\n\nThat was just an image on someone's wall.\n\nThe minute when I could hug my brother is forever lost.\n\nI wonder if our blood is enough to pay the cost!\n\nIt's enough to pay the cost!\n\n\n\nThe moment when I could hug my friend\n\nIt is forever lost.\n\nAnd now they want us to pay the cost\n\nAnd now they want us to pay the cost!\n\n\n\nThe moment when I could hug my friend\n\nI hope it's still not lost!\n\nWhen they want us to pay the cost\n\nWe refuse to pay the cost!\n\n\n\nI call to cut the strings!\n\nI urge to fold down your wings!\n\nWe call you out to free us from your strings!\n\nWe urge to lay and fold down your wings!\n\n\n\nWhen two empires collide!"
