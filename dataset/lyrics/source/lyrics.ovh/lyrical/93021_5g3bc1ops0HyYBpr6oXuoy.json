  "lyrics": "Young, broke, bright-eyed\r\n'Too trusting\" written on my chest\r\nThinking that everything's fine\r\nBut really I don't know what's best for me\r\nFor me\r\nI don't know what's best for me\n\nMmm\n\n\n\nI dug myself deep, deep in this mess\n\nFalling in love with one night to test\n\nYou and me both, both know it's me\n\nCause it ain't love, you can't trust me\n\nYea, you can't trust me\n\nYou can't trust me\n\n\n\nCause I don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nWith trust in you\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\n\n\nAnd I wouldn't trust me too\n\nAnd I wouldn't trust me too\n\n\n\nCause I don't trust myself\n\n\n\nNo, I was fine, fine, fine\n\nEverything was so simple\n\nI had no time but I had it all\n\nNow all I do is worry\n\nAbout my trust in everyone\n\nYou know it's easier to smell the smoke\n\nThan to stop a loaded gun\n\n\n\nCause nobody knows what happened\n\nAnd I'd be lying if I said that I did\n\nBut I came with something and left with less than nothing\n\nSo trust just isn't something I give\n\n\n\nCause I don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nWith trust in you\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nAnd I wouldn't trust me too\n\nAnd I wouldn't trust me too\n\nCause I don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nWith trust in you\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nCause I don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nWith trust in you\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nI don't trust myself\n\nWith trust in you\n\nAnd I wouldn't trust me too"
