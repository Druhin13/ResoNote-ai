  "lyrics": "Noises in my head\r\nAnd endless [?] rain on me\r\nLike a storm\r\nLike hurricane\r\nLosses piled up like wood steps\r\nStories high\n\nFeels like I've been framed\n\nI have no alibi\n\nUsed to be that all I needed\n\nWas what I didn't possess\n\nHurting makes you who you end up as\n\nMore or less\n\nEvery choice I made that worked out\n\nWas just a lucky guess\n\nJust a lucky guess\n\n\n\nAdventures half discarded\n\nHalf held onto now\n\nDancing on the ledge\n\nTo the edge somehow\n\nWell I can still pick out the faces\n\nThough I forget the names\n\nIn places that I've gone\n\nBut the urge remains\n\nTo throw caution to the wind\n\nOr is it to the stars\n\nTo hold out my open hands\n\nTo spite my empty heart\n\nTo wear my heart down on my sleeve\n\nJust like a battle scar\n\nThese are battle scars\n\n\n\nThere's comfort in a late night kitchen's radio\n\nAnd in a letter sent\n\nLists of what you know\n\nWhen you don't know anything\n\nYou make another one\n\nIt's good to write it down\n\nStarting with the sun\n\nAnd sometimes church bells, trees, and seasons\n\nMarking times gone by\n\nSometimes starlings swell\n\nSome tidal moons\n\nAnd filled up eyes\n\nSometimes everything at once\n\nBut sometimes just the sky\n\nSometimes just the sky"
