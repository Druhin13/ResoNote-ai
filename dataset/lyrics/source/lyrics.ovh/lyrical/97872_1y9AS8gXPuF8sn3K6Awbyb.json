  "lyrics": "Give me that guitar\r\nAnd throw me in a crowded room\r\nShe bit her lip and kissed me hard\r\nPlease drag me down the darkest night with you\r\nPose your friends and laugh a moment\r\nFrozen at the bar\n\nCatch your reflection in the glass\n\nTry to forget just who you really are\n\n\n\nStrange love\n\nDon't let the madness change us\n\nAll of the good vibrations\n\nRoll on for one more\n\nIt’s a strange love\n\nLie on the floor with strangers\n\nAll of the good vibrations\n\nRoll on for one more\n\nRoll on for one more\n\n\n\nTwenty dollar drinks\n\nThe smell of perfume in her bed\n\nShe traces lines across my skin\n\nAnd leaves me dancing on the razor's edge\n\nShe straightens out her dress\n\nAnd wipes the lipstick off her teeth\n\nYou're just a crater of yourself\n\nAnd she’s the fallen angel underneath\n\n\n\nStrange love\n\nDon't let the madness change us\n\nAll of the good vibrations\n\nRoll on for one more\n\nIt's a strange love\n\nLie on the floor with strangers\n\nAll of the good vibrations\n\nRoll on for one more\n\nRoll on for one more\n\n\n\nStrange love\n\nDon't let the madness change us\n\nAll of the good vibrations\n\nRoll on for one more\n\nIt's a strange love\n\nLie on the floor with strangers\n\nAll of the good vibrations\n\nRoll on for one more\n\nRoll on for one more\n\n\n\nPose your friends and laugh a moment\n\nFrozen at the bar\n\nCatch your reflection in the glass\n\nTry to forget just who you really are"
