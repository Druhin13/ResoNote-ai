  "lyrics": "You say you ain't got time for games\r\nNo more games\r\nBut the world got time for games with you\r\nPlay your own\r\nPlaying with your money and your heart\r\nJust admit you don't know what to do\n\nI've seen a lot of things come and go\n\nLots of pimps and tons of hoes\n\nHow this ends, we'll never know\n\n\n\nA king in his castle\n\nA king of the hill\n\nWasting his time\n\nChasing cheap thrills\n\nHe knows it's gonna cost him\n\nGod knows how much\n\n\n\nBut you know you gotta pay or play (pay or play)\n\nAt the end of the day (at the end of the day)\n\nPlaying with your money and your heart\n\nThere's got to be another way\n\n\n\nA king in his castle\n\nA king of the hill\n\nWasting his time\n\nChasing cheap thrills\n\nHe knows it's gonna cost him\n\nGod knows how much"
