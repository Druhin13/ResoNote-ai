  "lyrics": "Thought you'd have my babi\r\nLet me down, I never could fathom\r\nTold me you were ready\r\nRearranged my life just to fight for you\r\nTell me why should I change for you?\n\nOpened it up, gave you my all\n\nIt always seemed like it wasn't enough\n\nI've tried to forget, peace and reset\n\nBut I can't forgive no more (Forgive no more)\n\n\n\nI left you in the corners of my mind\n\nI erased you from my life\n\nThere's no in-betweens this time\n\nSaid, I lost you in the corners of my mind\n\nCan't let you dim my light\n\nGot control of it this time\n\nI left you (Left you)\n\nI lost you (Lost you)\n\n\n\nIt was yesterday\n\nYou couldn't look me in my eyes, and then\n\nThere was nothing more that I could say\n\nI thought what we had was unbreakable\n\nGuess I was wrong\n\n\n\nOpened it up, gave you my all\n\nI know it seemed like you weren't enough\n\nTry to forget, peace and reset\n\nBut I can't forgive you no more\n\n\n\nI left you in the corners of my mind\n\nI erased you from my life\n\nThere's no in-betweens this time\n\nSaid, I lost you in the corners of my mind\n\nCan't let you dim my light\n\nGot control of it this time\n\n\n\nWe never said goodbye\n\nWe used to fantasize\n\nI only dream about you, without you\n\nOh, our love ain't one to follow\n\nOur love won't see tomorrow\n\nI only dream about us, without us\n\n\n\nI left you in the corners of my mind\n\nI erased you from my life\n\nThere's no in-betweens this time\n\nSaid, I lost you in the corners of my mind\n\nCan't let you dim my light\n\nGot control of it this time"
