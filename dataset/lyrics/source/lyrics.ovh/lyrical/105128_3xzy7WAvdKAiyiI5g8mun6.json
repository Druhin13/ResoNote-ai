  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Hypnotised par Years & Years\r\nI had a dream of a ship that was sailed in the night\nSuch a sweet, sweet call\nThe siren soothes my mind\nWho am I going to be when the curtain is drawn?\nIn the cold, cold light they whisper to me, \"take it all\"\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nThe fortune said, \"Flowers bloom with no regret\"\n\nSurround me, body and soul\nPull me into your glow, make me blush\nUnbound me, spin me in gold\nAs the story unfolds in your touch\n\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nWho can breathe me into life?\nOoh-ooh-ooh-ooh\nJust one more look at you\nMy heart has been hypnotized\n\nI know a place where it's always so perfect and blue\nAnd the boy says, \"Babe, believe me, it's all for you\"\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nThe fortune said, \"Flowers bloom with no regret\"\n\nSurround me, body and soul\nPull me into your glow, make me blush\nUnbound me, spin me in gold\nAs the story unfolds in your touch\n\n\nOoh-ooh oh ooh\nWho can breathe me into life?\nOoh-ooh oh ooh\nJust one more look at you\nMy heart has been hypnotized\n\nAnd every color comes to life\nAs petals fall before your eyes\nYou kiss me and I'm hypnotized\n\nSurround me, body and soul\nPull me into your glow, make me blush\nUnbound me, spin me in gold\nAs the story unfolds in your touch\n\nOoh-ooh oh ooh\nWho can breathe me into life?\n\nOoh-ooh oh ooh\nJust one more look at you\nMy heart has been hypnotized"
