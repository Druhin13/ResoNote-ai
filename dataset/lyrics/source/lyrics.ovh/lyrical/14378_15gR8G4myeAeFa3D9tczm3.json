  "lyrics": "A dusty road circles through the junkyard scraps\r\nCold train frozen to rusty old track\r\nHad me a dream to give that highway a whirl\r\nSome dreams change fast, I stayed for the girl\r\nYou can fly, you can ride, you can roll, you can run\n\nBut everything's nothing unless you got someone\n\nIf I would've left here then I would've lost her\n\nI stayed, I stayed, I stayed for the girl\n\n\n\nA young gun shoulder and a thousand pound chip\n\nAnywhere's better than the hole you're in\n\nCouldn't let her be the girl in the songs I heard\n\nYeah the ones that got away, I stayed for the girl\n\n\n\nYou can fly, you can ride, you can roll, you can run\n\nBut everything's nothing unless you got someone\n\nIf I would've left here then I would've lost her\n\nI stayed, I stayed, I stayed\n\n\n\nI stayed from the very first night\n\nAnd I'll stay for the rest of my life\n\nHey!\n\n\n\nHard heads drag around the heaviest hearts\n\nNever know what they've got till they've gone too far\n\nIf there ever was a smile that I knew I couldn't leave\n\nIs the one right here smiling back at me\n\n\n\nYou can fly, you can ride, you can roll, you can run\n\nBut everything's nothing unless you got someone\n\nIf I would've left here then I would've lost her\n\nI stayed, I stayed, I stayed for the girl\n\nI stayed, I stayed, I stayed for the girl\n\nI stayed, I stayed, I stayed for the girl\n\n\n\nEh, eh!"
