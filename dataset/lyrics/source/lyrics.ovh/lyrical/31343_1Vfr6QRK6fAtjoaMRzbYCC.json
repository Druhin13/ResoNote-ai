  "lyrics": "I don't need no psychologist\r\nTrying to figure out why I got these fucking problems\r\nI'm a motherfucking anarchist\r\nAnd ain't nobody ever gonna be able to solve 'em\r\nI don't care what you wanna call 'em\r\nIt's too late to fix me, I'm at Rock Bottom\n\nI'd rather blow my brains with a shotgun\n\nThan sit there listening to your fucking nonsense\n\nI guess that's all you offer\n\nSo why do I even bother?\n\nI don't need all your doctors\n\nTo make me feel like a million dollars\n\nInstead of trying to escape\n\nOr just looking the other way\n\nI will learn from my mistakes\n\nLearn to communicate\n\nLearn to communicate\n\n\n\nI need to find a way, I need a miracle\n\nI need to know if I'm all alone in this world\n\nI need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul\n\nI need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow\n\n\n\nYou say that you're on edge\n\nBecause you pop a couple Xannies with some random loser friends?\n\nSay I'm a bum but you're homeless yourself\n\nThe biggest loser of 'em all, living in that flesh\n\nI don't care how low you hang down your belt\n\nIf your poetry's deep, homie, it ain't heartfelt\n\nI don't care if you've had it up to here\n\nI'm gonna kick your ass, make it nice and clear\n\nYou wanna talk blood, sweat, and tears!\n\nWhen you act and look like a saint, queer\n\nYou wanna act tough like \"you're shit, don't sing\"\n\nBut when you're hurt, it's always like your heart sinks\n\nInstead of trying to escape\n\nOr just looking the other way\n\nI will learn from my mistakes\n\nLearn to communicate\n\n\n\nI need to find a way, I need a miracle\n\nI need to know if I'm all alone in this world\n\nI need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul\n\nI need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow!\n\n\n\nNo more sorrow!\n\nNo pill to swallow!\n\nAs millions follow!\n\nI will not sell my soul!\n\n\n\nYou wanna place us all in the same boat?\n\nThank God I got a mind of my own\n\nI might be crazy holding on to this rope\n\nFucking you up like Geronimo\n\nThis birdie's still safely in his zone\n\nFloating all around like a fucking ghost\n\nDon't really care how I'm diagnosed\n\nThis song is when the bomb drops, it pretty much goes\n\n\n\nI need to find a way, I need a miracle\n\nI need to know if I'm all alone in this world\n\nI need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul\n\nI need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow\n\nI need to find a way, I need a miracle\n\nI need to know if I'm all alone in this world\n\nI need to heal these wounds deep down inside my soul\n\nI need to know where this path will go for me tomorrow"
