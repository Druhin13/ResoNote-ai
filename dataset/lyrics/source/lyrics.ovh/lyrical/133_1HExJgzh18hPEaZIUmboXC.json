  "lyrics": "We're in the building where they make us grow\r\nAnd I'm frightened by the liquid engineers\r\nLike you\r\nMy Mallory heart is sure to fail\r\nI could crawl around the floor just like I'm real\n\nLike you\n\n\n\nThe sound of metal\n\nI want to be you\n\nI should learn to be a man\n\nLike you\n\n\n\nPlug me in\n\nAnd turn me on\n\nOh, everything is moving\n\n\n\nI need my treatment, it's tomorrow they send me\n\nSinging, \"I am an American\"\n\nDo you?\n\n\n\nPicture this, if I could make the change\n\nI'd love to pull the wires from the wall\n\nDid you?\n\n\n\nAnd who are you?\n\nAnd how could I try?\n\nHere inside, I like metal\n\nDid you?\n\n\n\nAnd who are you?\n\nAnd how could I try?\n\nHere inside, I like metal\n\nDon't you?\n\n\n\nAll I know\n\nIs no one dies\n\nI'm still confusing love with need"
