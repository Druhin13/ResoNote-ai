  "lyrics": "Some days I won't get out of bed\r\nLet air-conditioned thoughts inside my head\r\nLike I don't know myself\r\nAnd I build up a fence\r\nPush away the things that once made sense\r\nAnd I won't want your help\n\nAll alone on the step\n\nWaiting for the gates to open up\n\n\n\nOh brother; brother's keeper\n\nI'll follow will you lead us?\n\nOh sister; mother's daughter\n\nI wonder, will you preach?\n\nWill I learn to get better?\n\n\n\nSometimes I just stare into space\n\nWatch through all the film of my mistakes\n\nI just can't help myself\n\nAll alone on the step\n\nWaiting for the gates to open up\n\n\n\nOh brother; brother's keeper\n\nI'll follow will you lead us?\n\nOh sister; mother's daughter\n\nI wonder, will you preach?\n\nWill I learn to get better?\n\n\n\nOne day I will climb down the step\n\nJust give me one good reason to pretend\n\n\n\nOh brother; brother's keeper\n\nI'll follow will you lead us?\n\nOh sister; mother's daughter\n\nI wonder, will you preach?\n\nWill I learn to get better?"
