  "lyrics": "Another night on the straits\r\nAll bug-eyed and babbling\r\nOut on the corner\r\nOf 7th and 8th\r\nI'm in the business of living\r\nYeah, that's something I'd say\n\nAll I need is a new friend\n\nI'm only five blocks away\n\n\n\nSpeak to me\n\nWon't you speak, sweet angel?\n\nDon't you remember me?\n\nI was God's favorite customer\n\n\n\nBeware the man who has everything\n\nEverything that he wants\n\nYou can spot him from a mile away\n\nIn his gold chain and only one pair of socks\n\nI'm out here testing the maxim\n\nThat all good things have to stop\n\nThe bar closes at 5\n\nBut the big man is just opening shop\n\n\n\nSpeak to me\n\nWon't you speak, sweet angel?\n\nDon't you remember me?\n\nI was God's favorite customer\n\nBut now I'm in trouble\n\n\n\nSpeak to me\n\nWon't you speak, sweet angel?\n\nI need some company\n\nI swear, just one more night longer"
