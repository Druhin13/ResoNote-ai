  "lyrics": "Another late night, looking at her\r\nAll her exes never mattered\r\nShe don’t break hearts, they get shattered\r\nThey get shattered\r\nPeople talking, chitter chatter\r\nShe calls shotgun, people scatter\n\nShe go bang bang, till it splatters\n\nTill it splatters\n\n\n\nShe got me losing touch\n\nShe got me losing faith\n\nMaking the same excuses\n\nFor the same mistakes\n\nBefore it all goes dark\n\nBefore I fade away\n\nI wanna turn you on\n\nWatch you illuminate\n\n\n\nWhen you walk in you light up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nWhen you walk in you light up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nAnd I see nothing but you\n\n\n\nAll that glitz and all that glamour\n\nWearing rings like she was Saturn\n\nThat’s that sci-fi shit I’m after\n\nShit I’m after\n\n\n\nShe got me losing touch\n\nShe got me losing faith\n\nMaking the same excuses\n\nFor the same mistakes\n\nBefore it all goes dark\n\nBefore I fade away\n\nI wanna turn you on\n\nWatch you illuminate\n\n\n\nWhen you walk in you light up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nWhen you walk in you light up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nAnd I see nothing but you\n\n\n\nYou throw game like daggers I’m aware\n\nLeave behind cadavers everywhere\n\nMind full of dark matter, best beware\n\nLeave the morning after, don’t you dare\n\n\n\nWhen you walk in you light up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nWhen you walk in you light up the room\n\nLight up the room\n\nAnd I see nothing but you"
