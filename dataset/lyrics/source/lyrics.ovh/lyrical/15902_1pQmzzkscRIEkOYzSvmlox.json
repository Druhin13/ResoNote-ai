  "lyrics": "I'm so addicted to this tiny world of my own\r\nStuck in my cage and so abused to the bone\r\nI'm so addicted to this tiny world of my own\r\nStuck in my cage and so abused to the bone\r\nThat was predicted too. See how they panic so good\n\nFed up with everything being out of order\n\n\n\nI hear the morning love affairs\n\nWake me when it's over 目を覚まさせて\n\nJust like your God has sentenced time\n\n\n\n逆生して見せよ　終焉の浸透\n\nTake me under, take me down with you\n\n断ち切った想いを　そうね Just take me under\n\nWhy don't you take me down with you\n\n\n\nSo you're addicted too 抜け出せぬまま\n\nFed up with everything 'cause you're just out of order\n\nI see the floating worlds collide\n\nWake me when it's over 今際の日まで\n\n生まれ変わるのさ\n\n\n\n逆生してリビドー　まやかしよ\n\nTake me under, take me down with you\n\n消し去った記憶と　そうね Just take me under\n\nWhy don't you take me down with you\n\n\n\nSo take me down with you\n\n'Cause I'll sing here with you\n\n\n\nA fragile song\n\nSo hope it's closer, hope it's somewhere\n\nWhen it's over, hope we don't care\n\nI'll be there to bear when it comes true\n\n\n\nSo take me down with you\n\nWe're born in fire, we ride again\n\nそう Yes God, Just take me under!\n\nWon't you take me down with you\n\n\n\n逆生して見せよ　終焉の浸透\n\nTake me under, take me down with you\n\n断ち切った想いを　そうね Just take me under\n\nWhy don't you take me down with you"
