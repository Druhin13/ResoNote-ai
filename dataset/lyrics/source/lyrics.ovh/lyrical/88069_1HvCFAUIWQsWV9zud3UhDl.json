  "lyrics": "What's the trick? I wish I knew\r\nI'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been\r\nAnd I know you want me, too\r\nAll it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you\r\nYou cross that line and it's time to say F you\n\nWhat's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react?\n\nYou think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that\n\nYou're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad\n\nGuess I'm stuck with you, and that's that\n\n\n\n'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever\n\nWhen it don't work out for the better\n\nIf it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye\n\nWhen it all falls down, when it all falls down\n\nI'll be fine, I'll be fine\n\nYou're the drug that I'm addicted to\n\nAnd I want you so bad, but I'll be fine\n\n\n\nWhy we fight? I don't know\n\nWe say what hurts the most\n\nOh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal\n\nAll these firing shots and making ground\n\nIt's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go\n\n\n\n'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever\n\nWhen it don't work out for the better\n\nIf it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye\n\nWhen it all falls down, when it all falls down\n\nI'll be fine, I'll be fine\n\nYou're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad\n\nBut I'll be fine\n\n\n\nI'll be fine, fine...\n\n\n\n'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever (Then whatever, babe)\n\nWhen it don't work out for the better (For the better)\n\nIf it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye\n\nWhen it all falls down (When it all, when it all)\n\nWhen it all falls down (When it all falls down)\n\nI'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine), I'll be fine (I'll be fine)\n\nYou're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad\n\nBut I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that"
