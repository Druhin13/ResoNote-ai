  "lyrics": "Breathing in the dark\r\nLying on its side\r\nThe ruins of the day\r\nPainted with a scar\r\nAnd the more I straighten out\r\nThe less it wants to try\n\nThe feelings start to rot\n\nOne wink at a time\n\n\n\nOh\n\nForgiving who you are\n\nFor what you stand to gain\n\nJust know that if you hide\n\nIt doesn't go away\n\nWhen you get out of bed\n\nDon't end up stranded\n\nHorrified with each stone\n\nOn the stage\n\nMy little dark age\n\n\n\nPicking through the cards\n\nKnowing what's nearby\n\nThe carvings on the face\n\nSay they find it hard\n\nAnd the engine's failed again\n\nAll limits of disguise\n\nThe humor's not the same\n\nComing from denial\n\n\n\nOh\n\nI grieve in stereo\n\nThe stereo sounds strange\n\nI know that if you hide\n\nIt doesn't go away\n\nIf you get out of bed\n\nAnd find me standing all alone\n\nOpen-eyed\n\nBurn the page\n\nMy little dark age\n\n\n\nI grieve in stereo\n\nThe stereo sounds strange\n\nYou know that if it hides\n\nIt doesn't go away\n\nIf I get out of bed\n\nYou'll see me standing all alone\n\nHorrified\n\nOn the stage\n\nMy little dark age\n\n\n\nGiddy with delight\n\nSeeing what's to come\n\nThe image of the dead\n\nDead ends in my mind\n\n\n\nPolicemen swear to god\n\nLove's seeping from the guns\n\nI know my friends and I\n\nWould probably turn and run\n\nIf you get out of bed\n\nCome find us heading for the bridge\n\nBring a stone\n\nAll the rage\n\nMy little dark age\n\n\n\nI grieve in stereo\n\nThe stereo sounds strange\n\nI know that if you hide\n\nIt doesn't go away\n\nIf you get out of bed\n\nAnd find me standing all alone\n\nOpen-eyed\n\nBurn the page\n\nMy little dark age\n\n\n\nAll alone\n\nOpen-eyed\n\nBurn the page\n\nMy little dark age"
