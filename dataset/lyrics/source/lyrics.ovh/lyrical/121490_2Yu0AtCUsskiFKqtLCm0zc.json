  "lyrics": "Baby wants to dance\r\nPast the flat footed charterhouse boys\r\nFrom towns where the mothers can't stand\r\nThe sight of each other\r\nBaby wants to last\r\nIn the hearts of the wild and free\n\nShe knows that time takes all of us\n\nThrough every long hot heavy summer\n\n\n\nAnd all of them, they talk of national security\n\nOver garden fences made to buff the bats of breeze\n\nAnd chance encounters\n\n\n\nBaby wants to dance\n\nPast the Tuesday morning supermarket crowd\n\nShe knows we'll all sleep through the days\n\nThe Two-step drip fed our laughter\n\nSays she wants to last\n\nLast how you want to\n\nShe's a light in the young boy's eyes\n\nThrough every long hot heavy summer\n\n\n\nAnd all of them, they talk of national security\n\nOver garden fences made to buff the bats of breeze\n\nYeah all of them, shuffling down that lonely street\n\nOne last gasp\n\nAgainst a long hot heavy summer"
