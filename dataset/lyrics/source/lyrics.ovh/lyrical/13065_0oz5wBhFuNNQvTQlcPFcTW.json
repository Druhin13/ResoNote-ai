  "lyrics": "I tightened my grip\r\nAround my bow\r\nI'll try to save you all\r\nKnuckles turning white\r\nBlood runs cold\r\nThere's a boy with no face\n\n\n\nI don't feel there's much separation\n\nI'm an animal\n\nHope leaves when the waves come crashing\n\n\n\nI've never been a religious man\n\nBut I'm slipping under drowning\n\nIn your eyes\n\nI've never been a religious man\n\nBut I'm slipping under drowning\n\nIn your\n\n\n\nFootprints in the snow\n\nThe sun runs off\n\nThe gloom begins to grow\n\nThe bleak reaches these bones\n\nRushing through\n\nThere's a boy with no face\n\n\n\nI don't feel there's much separation\n\nI'm an animal\n\nHope leaves when the waves come crashing\n\n\n\nI've never been a religious man\n\nBut I'm slipping under drowning\n\nIn your eyes\n\nI've never been a religious man\n\nBut I'm slipping under drowning\n\nIn your\n\n\n\nI left you the forest\n\nLet the spirit go\n\nRid this place of monsters"
