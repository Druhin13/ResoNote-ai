  "lyrics": "Had to make a way, had to make a play\r\nGive a fuck with it, cause I had to drive that Wraith\r\nHad to make a way, had to make a play\r\nI don't give a fuck, cause I could lose it all today\r\nAnd it's not a discussion of color\n\nDifferent races, though we all brothers\n\nIf we in the same struggle, all on the same hassle\n\nTryna get all the pieces to the puzzle\n\nIn the right spot and see how beautiful it turned out\n\nThe big picture\n\nMe countin' millions, dividin' them amongst my team and they providin' for their children\n\nJet Life an empire, though I'm still buildin'\n\nYou can always expand, develop on land\n\nWhere no other businesses stand\n\nYou can be a pioneer man, like the hood air conditioning\n\nOpen window with the box fan in it\n\nMy nigga authentic\n\nMore wet rozay nectin' imperial, smokin' them bowl\n\nThen I prepare a bowl of cereal\n\nThe angel on the Rolls Royce got me feelin' spiritual\n\nSame time, one phone call and send them hitters through\n\nBag of silencers in that black Beamer coupe\n\nYou ain't dreaming fool\n\n\n\nHad to make a way, had to make a play\n\nGive a fuck with it, cause I had to drive that Wraith\n\nHad to make a way, had to make a play\n\nI don't give a fuck, cause I could lose it all today\n\nHad to make a way, had to make a play\n\nGive a fuck with it, cause I had to drive that Wraith\n\nHad to make a way, had to make a play\n\nI don't give a fuck, cause I could lose it all today\n\n\n\nHad to make a way, had to make a play\n\nGive a fuck with it, cause I had to drive that Wraith\n\nOne thing about me they say I'm always in the Bape\n\nBallin', dribblin', switchin' lanes all day"
