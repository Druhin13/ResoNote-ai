I just hope that all this lasts\n\nI just bought my mom a house, half a million all in cash\n\nPassin' CD's out for free, ain't no way I'm goin' back\n\nFuck these feelings, this ain't me, devil keep tryna distract\n\nI be goin' through it on the low (Yeah)\n\nI be tryna hide it (Hide it)\n\nI be doin' dirt on the hush\n\nI be keepin' quiet (Quiet)\n\nI don't wanna lose this shit (No way)\n\nMama can't afford that life (That life)\n\nPull out the McLaren for the day (Then what?)\n\nPull up in the Porsche at night, tryna run away from\n\nAll these demons after me\n\nThey just keep harassin' me\n\nThey ain't gonna stop until I fall\n\n\n\nStarin' in the mirror like, \"What happened to me?\"\n\nYou been starvin', ain't had nothin' to eat\n\nAnd lately you been scared to fall asleep\n\n'Cause you been havin' bad dreams of me fallin' (Fallin', fallin')\n\nStarin' in the mirror like, \"What happened to me?\" (What happened to me?)\n\nYou been starvin', ain't had nothin' to eat (Yeah, yeah)\n\nAnd lately you been scared to fall asleep (Yeah, yeah)\n\n'Cause you been havin' bad dreams of me fallin' (Fallin', fallin')\n\n\n\nToo young (Ooh, ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)\n\nTo young (Fallin', fallin')"
