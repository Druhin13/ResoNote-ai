  "lyrics": "Were we the hammer\r\nWere we the powder\r\nWere we the cold evening air\r\nWere we the wild geese\r\nWere we the tall trees\r\nWere we the shot in the air\n\n\n\nAnd the background noise\n\nGoes fading now\n\nNo sounds, just the quiver of a lip\n\nEven the moon’s half holding back\n\n\n\nLook, we’re falling so easy\n\nLike the rain in the dirty south\n\nJustified for the fighting\n\nWere we living in the lion’s mouth?\n\n\n\nAnd the background noise\n\nGoes fading out\n\nNo sounds, just the quiver of a lip\n\nEven the moon’s half holding out"
