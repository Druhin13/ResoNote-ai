  "lyrics": "I think I fell in love today\r\nHe thinks it's too soon to say\r\nBut my heart told me so\r\nI don't know exactly how it happened\r\nIt kind of felt like magic\r\nI guess when you know you know\n\n\n\nCause love don't have any rules\n\nWhen gravity starts to pull you closer to the other\n\nFrom a friend to a lover\n\nLike a spark catching fire it don't happen all the time\n\nBut when it does it changes everything\n\nAnd I think I fell in love today\n\n\n\nI think I fell in love today\n\nI'm sure he saw it on my face\n\nCause I couldn't break my smile\n\nThe stars didn't line up in a row\n\nAnd there wasn't a fireworks show\n\nBut in that moment, I knew he was mine\n\n\n\nCause love don't have any rules\n\nWhen gravity starts to pull you closer to the other\n\nFrom a friend to a lover\n\nLooks like forever in his eyes that don't happen all the time\n\nBut when it does it changes everything\n\nAnd I think I fell in love today\n\nYeah-yeah, I think I fell in love today\n\nYeah-yeah\n\n\n\nAsk me again a few years down the road\n\nCause I guess by then, we'll know\n\n\n\nBut I think I fell in love today\n\nI'm sure I've never felt this way\n\nWith you\n\nAnd I think you may just feel the same\n\nSo, baby won't you say\n\nYou love me too"
