  "lyrics": "You know I love you..\r\nSome nights.. tell me what you want\r\nI'm on my own, I can do more\r\nAlone, I'm not worried about it\r\nAlone, let's go\n\nAnd I cannot even pretend to feel your love\n\nWhen I’m dying just to see you in my bed\n\nAnd I spoke to you but I'm not even aware\n\nThere was a feeling and that feeling wasn't right\n\n\n\nAnd I cannot even pretend to feel your love\n\nWhen I’m dying just to see you in my bed\n\nAnd I spoke to you but I'm not even aware\n\nThere was a feeling and that feeling wasn't right\n\n\n\nWould you say feelings are forever in a flash?\n\nIf we were honest with each other for a second\n\nWhen I cannot even remember what I said\n\nCan you really count on me to be forever?\n\n\n\nAnd have you ever tried to cut me like a knife?\n\nCan you see how my heart is at an intersection?\n\nIf you’re a path then it’s the one I want to take\n\nIt’s not the distance that keeps both of us away\n\n\n\nHave you ever really said you’ve had enough?\n\nA conversation that will lead me back to you\n\nTell me, have you ever missed being on top?\n\nI can’t remember when it ever really\n\nI don’t remember spending nights being alone\n\nI cast a sigil that was charged in midnight hours\n\nI haven’t thought about the way I felt the knife\n\nCan’t say I really ever ripped into your eyes\n\nCan’t say enough about the way I feel your heartbeat racing out\n\nSo why don’t you tell me that you’re down?\n\nCome on why don’t you tell me I’m the one?\n\nWhy do you pretend you’re not in love?\n\n\n\nCan’t say enough about the way I feel my heart’s in the background so why don’t you tell me that you’re down?\n\n(that you’re down)\n\nI told you that I’d come to you\n\nI’ll take shots and I’ll make promises\n\nTo put that knife right through you\n\nAnd you say you had enough\n\nAnd you really have that Lex Luger\n\nAnd I’m really out in Denver\n\nAnd you told me that you’d stay (that you’d stay)\n\nDon’t keep pushing me away\n\nAnd I really know it’s Denver and I want you baby\n\nUntil this time my tongue was tied\n\nI never knew the words to say\n\nThat I know that it's forever and I really want you, baby\n\n\n\nAnd I cannot even pretend to feel your love\n\nWhen I’m dying just to see you in my bed\n\nAnd I spoke to you but I'm not even aware\n\nThere was a feeling and that feeling wasn't right\n\n\n\nWould you say feelings are forever in a flash?\n\nIf we were honest with each other for a second\n\nWhen I cannot even remember what I said\n\nCan you really count on me to be forever?"
