  "lyrics": "Looking skinny gives me hate\r\nHave you gotten out of bed?\r\nHave you gotten out of bed?\r\nGetting concerned about my lonely friend\r\nHave you seen yourself today?\n\nYou're going to need a haircut and a shave\n\nI can see behind your eyes\n\nOh, but your mind is getting wasted\n\nYou're always getting wasted all the time\n\nGetting concern about your lonely days\n\nLooking for the drugs\n\nYou find yourself stuck in a haze\n\n\n\nHave you heard the news that you're on your own?\n\nHave you heard the news you go nowhere to go, go, go, go, no\n\n\n\nI'll fly to moon the moon again\n\nCause I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head\n\nI'll fly to the moon again\n\nI'm dying in a hot tub\n\nI'm dying in a hot tub with my friends\n\n\n\nOh, you're a dinosaur today\n\nThen you're an astronaut tomorrow\n\nYou're a space man in the Milky Way\n\nLooking for way outside\n\nBut you left your brain upstairs\n\nNext to James and Pierre, but\n\n\n\nHave you heard the news that you're on your own?\n\nHave you heard the news you got nowhere to go, go, go, go, no\n\n\n\nI'll fly to the moon again\n\nCause I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head\n\nI'll fly to the moon again\n\nI'm dying in a hot tub\n\nI'm dying in a hot tub once again\n\n\n\nI'll fly to the moon again, yeah\n\nCause I'm sleeping with clothes up on my head\n\nI'll fly to the moon again\n\nI'm dying in a hot tub\n\nI'm dying in a hot tub with my friends"
