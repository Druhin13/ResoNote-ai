  "lyrics": "Tumble outta bed\r\nAnd I stumble to the kitchen\r\nPour myself a cup of ambition\r\nAnd yawn and stretch\r\nAnd try to come to life\r\nJump in the shower\n\nAnd the blood starts pumpin'\n\nOut on the street\n\nThe traffic starts jumpin'\n\nThe folks like me on the job from 9 to 5\n\n\n\nWorkin' 9 to 5,\n\nWhat a way to make a livin'\n\nBarely gettin' by\n\nIt's all takin' and no givin'\n\nThey just use your mind\n\nAnd they never give you credit\n\nIt's enough to drive you crazy\n\nIf you let it\n\n9 to 5, for service and devotion\n\nYou would think that I\n\nWould deserve a fat promotion\n\nWant to move ahead\n\nBut the boss won't seem to let me\n\nI swear sometimes that man is out to get me\n\n\n\nThey let you dream\n\nJust to watch 'em shatter\n\nYou're just a step\n\nOn the boss-man's ladder\n\nBut you got dreams\n\nHe'll never take away\n\nYou're in the same boat\n\nWith a lotta your friends\n\nWaitin' for the day your ship'll come in\n\n'N' the tide's gonna turn\n\nAnd it's all gonna roll your way\n\n\n\nWorkin' 9 to 5\n\nWhat a way to make a livin'\n\nBarely gettin' by\n\nIt's all takin' and no givin'\n\nThey just use your mind\n\nAnd you never get the credit\n\nIt's enough to drive you crazy\n\nIf you let it\n\n9 to 5, yeah\n\nThey got you where they want you\n\nThere's a better life\n\nAnd you think about it, don't you\n\nIt's a rich man's game\n\nNo matter what they call it\n\nAnd you spend your life\n\nPuttin' money in his wallet\n\n\n\n9 to 5, whoa\n\nWhat a way to make a livin'\n\nBarely gettin' by\n\nIt's all takin' and no givin'\n\nThey just use your mind\n\nAnd they never give you credit\n\nIt's enough to drive you crazy\n\nIf you let it\n\n\n\n9 to 5, yeah\n\nThey got you where they want you\n\nThere's a better life\n\nAnd you dream about it, don't you\n\nIt's a rich man's game\n\nNo matter what they call it"
