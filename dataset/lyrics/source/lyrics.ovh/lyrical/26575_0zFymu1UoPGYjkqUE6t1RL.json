  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson In Retrospect par Vacations\r\nYour perspective is starting to shift\nWith these thoughts in retrospect\nWasn't clever enough to thrift\nYou spent too much on neglect\n\nAnd left yourself behind\nGave witness to your demise\nAnd came back to find\nWhat was missing inside\n\nChanges got you sentimental\nLearning your true worth wasn't accidental\nThe only way ahead is straight and true\nOut of the deep blue, turning you into someone new\n\n\nDawning of a new day\nWith the past falling to rest\nWhat good could swing your way\nAs you march forward with the best?\n\nFeeling lighter with time\nAs you shred off your skin\nBathed in the sublime\nThat you've found within\n\nChanges got you sentimental\nLearning your true worth wasn't accidental\nThe only way ahead is straight and true\nOut of the deep blue, turning you into someone new"
