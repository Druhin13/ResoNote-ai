  "lyrics": "Tell me the truth, how do you feel? \nLike you're rollin' so fast that you're spinnin' your wheels? \nDon't feel too bad, you're not all along \nWe're all tryin' to get along \nWith ev'rybody else try'n' to go their way \nYou're bound to get tripped, and what can you say? \n\nJust go along 'til they turn out the lights \n\nThere's nothin' we can do to fight it \n\n\n\nNo man's got it made till he's far beyond the pain \n\nAnd we who must remain go on living just the same \n\n\n\nI once knew a man, very talented guy \n\nHe's sing for the people and people would cry \n\nThey knew that his song came from deep down inside \n\nYou could hear it in his voice and see it in his eyes \n\n\n\nAnd so he traveled along, touch your heart, then be gone \n\nLike a flower, he bloomed till that old hickory wind \n\nCalled him home \n\n\n\nMy man's got it made \n\nHe's gone far beyond the pain \n\nAnd we who must remain go on living just the same \n\nWe who must remain go on laughing just the same \n\n\n\nLead Vocal: Bernie Leadon\n\nPedal Steel Guitar: Bernie Leadon"
