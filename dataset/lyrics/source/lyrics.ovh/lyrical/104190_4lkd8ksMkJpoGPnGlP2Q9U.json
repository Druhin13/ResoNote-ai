  "lyrics": "You come in waves\r\nTill you're all I know\r\nThen you fade away\r\nInto nothing\r\nWeighed down by dark matter inside\r\nYou leave me frozen\n\nYou leave me froze in time\n\nIn your\n\n\n\nEverglow\n\nYou'll never know\n\nThe beauty I see when you open your shadows\n\nEverglow\n\nThey'll never know\n\nThe worlds I see in the darkness you don't show\n\n\n\nOhh\n\nFalling through a landslide\n\nFeeling like the first time I felt you\n\nOhh\n\nCaught inside the field lines\n\nThat pull me to the land mines\n\nInside you\n\nBlack hole eyes won't gaze now\n\nDrawn in just the same\n\nYou leave me frozen\n\nYou leave me frozen inside\n\n\n\nCome\n\nI'll show every ghost in me\n\nTake my pain into you"
