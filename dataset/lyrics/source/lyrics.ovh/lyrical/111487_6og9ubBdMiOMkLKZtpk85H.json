  "lyrics": "Carry them over your shoulders, you fear\r\nThe absence, the void you'll cause\r\nWhen you choose to leave them all here\r\nThere's no turning back, it's time that you steer\r\nThe wide open stairs back alone at the cusp\n\nThe self that you thought you lost, the shine that burned well into rest\n\nYou can't hear my voice cause' I'm not loud enough\n\n\n\nBelieve me, when I say\n\nIt's a long way back from here\n\n\n\nGoodbye for now\n\nHang on, it's clear that the roads about to get rough\n\nOh, can you hear its ringing its left in my ear?\n\nOver and over, the light hits the dusk\n\nIt's a choice that I make but for us I choose to give it all up\n\nYou want me here? Well, then ask me to stay\n\n\n\nThe glistening wet concrete, the heat off the road\n\nThe clamoring hands and the bus you call home\n\nThis is it, believe what you want, in this space, I don't fit\n\n\n\nThe same day repeats with the things that you see\n\nDirty dressing room carpets and broken TVs\n\nIs this it? In this water I'll tread til' the day that I'm dead\n\n\n\nHang on, it's clear that the roads about to get rough\n\nOh, can you hear the ringing its left in my ear?\n\nOver and over, the light hits the dusk\n\nIt's a choice that I make but for us I choose to give it all up\n\nYou want me here? Well, then ask me to stay\n\n\n\nGoodbye for now, echo, echoes\n\nMile marker, minutes, hours\n\n\n\nIf this is it and there is no more\n\nAnd you believe that's true\n\nIt's a long way back from here\n\nThere's no going home\n\n\n\nHang on, it's clear that the roads about to get rough\n\nOh, can you hear the ringing its left in my ear?\n\nOver and over, the light hits the dusk\n\nIt's a choice that I make but for us I choose to give it all up\n\nYou want me here? Well, then ask me to stay\n\n\n\n(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)\n\nWell, then ask me to stay\n\n(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)\n\nWell, then ask me to stay\n\n(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)\n\nWell, then ask me to stay\n\n(Goodbye for now, echo, echoes)\n\nWell, then ask me to stay"
