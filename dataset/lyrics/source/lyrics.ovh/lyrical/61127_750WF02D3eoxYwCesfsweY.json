  "lyrics": "You’ve arrived and it feels as though you’ve been here for some time\r\nYou’ve been here all along\r\nNow you’re growing tired\r\nTry to rest under bright, chilling imminence\r\nTrapped where sands pile up behind you\r\nDrinking of a grotesque reflection\n\nDying to be carried away\n\n\n\nThe end won’t begin when you climb aboard\n\nWe have always been his passengers\n\nIn the ultimate sense\n\nWe were born to roam Kharon’s shores\n\n\n\nDo you know what time it was that you lost your shadow?\n\nIt’s sinking in\n\nIt happens all over again\n\n\n\nThe end won’t begin when you climb aboard\n\nWe have always been his passengers\n\nThe end won’t begin when you climb aboard\n\nWe have always been his passengers\n\n\n\nI didn't know that I was dying, you said\n\nHe said \"just give it time,\" and laughs\n\n\"out here everything just tends to fall into place\n\nAnd it all starts to make sense.\"\n\nRed sky at night; let's go for another ride\n\nLetting go of a grotesque reflection\n\nDying to be carried away"
