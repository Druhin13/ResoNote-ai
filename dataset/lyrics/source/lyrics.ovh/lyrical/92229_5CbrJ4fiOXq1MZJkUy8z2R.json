  "title": "It Once Was My Life",
  "lyrics": "There were people on the sidewalks\r\nStrolling down the avenues\r\nThey were sitting outside in cafes\r\nWe were looking for the muse\r\nWell I was locked in by the system\r\nWhere no freedom is the rule\n\nNow I spend all my time just trying\n\nTo make it understood\n\n\n\nIt once was my life, that's what everybody said\n\nAll the things I used to do and the people that were friends\n\nI've got to make it mean something at the end of the day\n\nIt once was my life, they can't take that away\n\n\n\nTrials and tribulations and stupidity still rules\n\nSometimes it looks like I'm on a ship of fools\n\n\n\nIt once was my life, when my message was just the street\n\nThen it became something else, and now it's incomplete\n\nI'm just trying to get back to when\n\nCan somebody please shed some light\n\nIt used to be my life, it used to be uptight\n\n\n\nTrials and tribulations and stupidity still rules\n\nSome days it just feels like I'm on a ship of fools\n\n\n\nI'm back here on the boards, I can hear the engines roar\n\nEverybody's got to pay, some people got to pay more\n\nWell you can tell the people anything\n\nSpoon feed them anything you like\n\nIt used to be so simple, it used to be my life\n\n\n\nNow everything is so complicated, just to speak or use the phone\n\nSome people try to use me, just 'cause they don't have their own\n\nDon't know who's round the corner, trying to sell me some more tripe\n\nIt used to be my life, it used to be my life....."
