  "lyrics": "I could wash you down like a glass of wine\r\nAnd I don't need to think anything twice\r\nYou know I wished you were here all the time\r\nLiving my fantasies out in real life\n\nEverything I'll give to you, darling, but\n\nUntil we reach morning you're mine\n\nAnd don't you worry now, baby\n\nI'm the man you been craving this time\n\n\n\nGuess you been dreaming 'bout me day and night\n\nI think that's real 'cause then you won't forget me\n\nAnd it's the reason why I hold you tight\n\nI will pray that day doesn't come\n\n\n\nYou know I wished you were here all the time\n\nLiving my fantasies out in real life\n\n\n\nEverything I'll give to you, darling, but\n\nUntil we reach morning you're mine\n\nAnd don't you worry now, baby\n\nI'm the man you been craving this time\n\nEverything I'll give to you, darling, but\n\nUntil we reach morning you're mine\n\nAnd don't you worry now, baby\n\nI'm the man you been craving this time"
