  "lyrics": "The simple point of now or never, tells you when I'm ready\r\nMy body's built for bad behavior, keeps me nice and steady\r\nThese fools around me always saying, saying how I need a little touch of class\r\nHey Scotty, can I get a ride to my karate? 'Cause I think it's time I kick some ass\r\nAnd get what I wish for\n\nOh yeah\n\nGet what I want\n\n\n\nYour drywall skills are fucking aces, not even elective\n\nYou smell bullshit from twenty paces, skills so damn effective\n\nThese kids all love to play the haters, until you park your car up on the grass\n\nSo Scotty, can I get a ride to my karate? 'Cause I really need to start kicking ass\n\n\n\nAnd get what I wish for\n\nOh yeah\n\nGet what I wish for\n\n\n\nI've made a mess of everything\n\nI'm not apologizing, it's just how sometimes things have to be\n\nIf it's not a problem, then I can go ahead\n\nAnd build a nesting house while you're away at Disney in May\n\n\n\nOh yeah\n\nGet what I wish for\n\nOh yeah\n\nGet what I wish for\n\nOh yeah"
