  "lyrics": "There's your man\r\nHe's far from brilliant\r\nSee him walk out the door, a lowered head and great resilience\r\nSee how he always wants to be around you\r\nSee how he always wants to be around you\r\nSomehow he always wants to be around\n\n\n\nSo that's how we live, in lavender and no affection\n\nIt's all talk and lavender and no affection\n\nIt's all talk, it's all talk\n\nIt's all talk\n\n(No affection)\n\n\n\nThere's your man staggering on\n\nSee him walk out the door, a lowered head, time ticking on\n\nSee how he always wants to be around you\n\nSee how he always wants to be around you\n\nSee how he always wants to be around\n\n\n\nCan't stand the way they talk of one another\n\nCan't stand the way they talk about one another\n\nCan't stand the way they talk\n\n\n\nSo that's how we live, in lavender and no affection\n\nIt's all talk and lavender and no affection\n\nIt's our dream, lavender and no affection\n\nIt's our dream, lavender and no affection\n\nThat's our dream\n\n(No affection)\n\n\n\nThere's your man, there's your man\n\nThere's your man, darling, there's your man\n\nThere's your man, there's your man"
