  "lyrics": "I look around and all I see are the reminders of a dream that died\r\nA sort of suicide, a love denied, a life incomplete\r\nSometimes, the best that you can do is just go silent and refuse to lose it\r\nTo choose your bruises and grit your teeth\r\nFind your feet\r\nI'm still the silly girl that's singing\n\n\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nCan't get enough of your love\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nI can't go on without your love\n\nBut I'm just gonna say it, what everybody knows\n\nLove blows\n\n\n\nAnd I am stuck at 17 when all the boys thought I was bossy and the girls could be so mean\n\nIt's like I stopped growing, ooh, ooh\n\nAnd now the look that's in his eyes, it's not for me\n\nAnother prize to win, she shimmies by for him and my light goes dim\n\nAnd we, and all the silly girls keep singing\n\n\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nCan't get enough of your love\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nI can't go on without your love\n\nBut I'm just gonna say it, what everybody knows\n\nLove blows\n\n\n\nBlows\n\nBlows\n\nBlows\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nCan't get enough of your love\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nI can't go on without your love\n\n\n\nNeed your love, I want your love\n\nCan't get enough of your love\n\nI need your love, I want your love\n\nI can't go on without your love\n\nBut I'm just gonna say it, what everybody knows\n\nLove blows"
