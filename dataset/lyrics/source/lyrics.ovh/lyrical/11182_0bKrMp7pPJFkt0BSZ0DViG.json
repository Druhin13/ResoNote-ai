  "lyrics": "When I look into your eyes\r\nI wonder how the hell you got so far\r\nFrom under all the things\r\nThat we've been through\r\nIf I steal the wheel you'll navigate\r\nAnd pick a song I like\n\nWe show up late to a funeral\n\nPast the town where I was born\n\n\n\nNow we belong nowhere\n\nI've got no place to fall\n\nWith no chance at all\n\n\n\nIt's days like these\n\nWhen all the world makes perfect sense\n\nCan finally see without our eyes\n\nWe know we can handle this\n\nIf tomorrow takes it all away\n\nWe still got more\n\nThan we'll ever know so close your eyes\n\nWe made it back to the town of Corazon\n\n\n\nAll the darkness in the world I see\n\nAnd the trouble with the name I bring on\n\nBaby wait for moments at a time\n\nSurrounded by the talk of spring\n\nAnd the revolution it would bring\n\nTo this beat up town\n\nWhere I was born\n\n\n\n'Cause you and I both know\n\nThere's no place to hide\n\nJust time alone\n\n\n\nIt's days like these\n\nWhen all the world makes perfect sense\n\nCan finally see without our eyes\n\nWe know we can handle this\n\nIf tomorrow takes it all away\n\nWe still got more\n\nThan we'll ever know so close your eyes\n\nWe made it back to the town of Corazon\n\n\n\nThis ship sinks faster than the sun\n\nYour life jacket will save no one\n\nThis ain't not place to lose your mind\n\nI'm getting outta mine\n\n\n\nIt's days like these\n\nWhen all the world makes perfect sense\n\nCan finally see without our eyes\n\nWe know we can handle this\n\nIf tomorrow takes it all away\n\nWe still got more\n\nThan we'll ever know so close your eyes\n\nWe made it back to the town of Corazon\n\nBaby we are home"
