  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Soldier par Neffex\r\nYeah\n\nI spit raps like a heart attack, fast fatal hard impact\nPast painful scars in fact, I blast tasteful bars in packs\nI back up my actions, fact, don't ask, grab reactions, jacked\nAttack with every word then act with class, as they hear me snap\nI got nothing to lose, 'cause I fought and felt the bruise\nNow I'm not the one confused, call the shots and they produce\nI ain't lost I'm finally loose, pick a noose over excuse\n\nI need the views to boost me to a new abuse of being used\nEverybody wants a piece now, y'all can rest in peace now\nYour dead to me so peace out, remember your discrete doubt\nGet ready for defeat now, I'm gon' make you bleed out\nListen on repeat now and weed out all the weak now\nGet up and make a change, don't remember yesterday\nIf you got something to say, speak your mind before your grave\n'cause your life is yours to save, ain't nobody gonna change\nEverybody stays the same, so be different, make a name, huh?\n\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\n\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nIt's ridiculous, I'm spitting this meticulous and limitless\nWhile others out there spitting shit, got hits up on the charts that sit\nI see why other artists quit: 'cause people don't reward good shit\nThey love to hate but hate to live, society you swing and miss\nAnd honestly, I get it, promise me you won't regret it\nWasting energy, forget it, don't look back, go on get it\nBite the bullet just a bit, bite your tongue and don't say shit\nMake your actions hard to miss, be a legend not a myth\n\nIt's obnoxious that I'm conscious, rapping honest\nAs promised, try to harness, as an artist\nStay modest, it's a long quest, I will not quit\n'til ten thousand people going off when I drop this\nI gotta make it now, swear to god I'm breaking out\nSwear to god I'll take a bow, center stage with a crowd\n'cause I got it figured out, I'm just honest and I'm loud\nStaying modest but I'm proud, no, I never had doubt, yea\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\n\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over\n\nAnd just like a soldier\nI keep on moving forward\nAlways getting closer\nI march until it's over"
