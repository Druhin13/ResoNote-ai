I know you smelling me\n\nMy fingers recently wrestled the evergreen\n\nBeen a hunnid proof, the message is ever clear\n\nSpeaking for the crew, I'm playing Miss Everdeen, peculiar\n\nYeah, I study Miss Peregrine, my pedigree\n\nDuke Nukem, yo' you can Uber or just let it be\n\nFalling outta harmony, be singing different melodies\n\nReally ain't spoke the same language in a long time\n\nBoth like to claim it's only 'cause the different latitude\n\nLong lines at shows got me distant with my attitude\n\nA matador, I know you mad at me\n\nI ain't even mad at you, not good with math...\n\n\n\nAyy, pull up puffing on the indo\n\nChevy sitting up on the 'renzos\n\nOld head hit me with the head nod\n\nI understood a nigga like 10-4\n\n10-4, 10-4, 10-4\n\n10-4, 10-4, 10-4\n\nOld head hit me with the head nod\n\nI understood a nigga like"
