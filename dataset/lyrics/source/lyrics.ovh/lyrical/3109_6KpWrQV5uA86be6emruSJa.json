  "lyrics": "I went to the movie\r\nthe other night,\r\nThe plot was groovy,\r\nit was out of sight.\r\nI sat with my popcorn,\r\nout lookin' for good times\n\nLost in the cartoon,\n\nI grabbed the lifeline.\n\n\n\nI've been a searcher,\n\nI've been a fool,\n\nBut I've been a long time\n\ncomin' to you.\n\nI'm hopin' for your love\n\nto carry me through\n\nYou're holdin' my baby,\n\nand I'm holdin' you,\n\nAnd it's all right.\n\n\n\nOh, tell me where\n\nthe answer lies.\n\nIs it in the notebook\n\nbehind your eyes?\n\nWhen your decision\n\ncomes to view,\n\nI'll be watchin' my TV,\n\nand it'll be watchin' you.\n\n\n\nI've been a searcher,\n\nI've been a fool,\n\nBut I've been a long time\n\ncomin' to you.\n\nI'm hopin' for your love\n\nto carry me through\n\nYou're holdin' my baby,\n\nand I'm holdin' you,\n\nYes I am.\n\n\n\nSpeakin' out."
