  "lyrics": "Hop! Step! And jump!\r\nDrew! Draw! Drawn!\r\nChip! Syrup! Whipped cream!\r\nThe me I wanna be\r\nYou see cool and calm and strong when you look at me\n\nBut you don’t know me well if that’s what you believe\n\n‘Cause underneath it all I’m just a normal girl\n\nI really wish that someone would see me for me\n\n\n\nI wanna push aside this pressure building up\n\nAnd finally act the way I really want\n\nNo matter what they say, I’m really not that way\n\nTo show you, my heart must first unlock\n\n\n\nBe yourself! ‘Cause what counts is on the inside\n\nShugo Chara is here to be your guide!\n\nBe yourself and don’t let anyone stop you\n\nCome on! I’ll show you the way\n\n\n\nJust be yourself! ‘Cause what counts is on the inside\n\nDon’t let the voices tell you otherwise\n\nBe yourself and don’t let anyone stop you\n\nWith you it’s possible, it’s true\n\n\n\nSo let’s hop! Step! And jump!\n\nDrew! Draw! Drawn!\n\nChip! Syrup! Whipped cream!\n\nThe me I wanna be"
