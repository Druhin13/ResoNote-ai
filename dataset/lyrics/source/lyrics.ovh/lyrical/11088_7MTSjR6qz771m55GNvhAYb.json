  "lyrics": "Baby I've been stompin' around in these heels for all the goddamn day\r\nI got aches and annoyance from living to earn my pay\r\nYet some piece and quiet from you would really go a long way\r\nSo ease it down\r\nYou see I'm tired, I'm spent\n\nI'm really feeling my age\n\nYou know life is twice as hard when you're living half on the stage\n\nAnd I barely have the energy to sing you this song\n\nSo let's get some cartoons and Vodka\n\nAnd do 'em all night long\n\n\n\nOooh boy, are you ready for some fun?\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, oooh Oooh boy, are you ready for some fun?\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, oooh \n\n\n\nYou can call me juvenile, but I'm picky on how I spend my time\n\nDon't you know, it takes two crates of makeup to go out lookin' this fine\n\nI don't work these nails to the bone to hear you squabble and whine\n\nSo help me out\n\n\n\nYou better believe that I'm hot, I'm wet\n\nAnd it's really not fair\n\nTakes more than a tall cool glass of you, there honey, to bring me up for air\n\nAnd I've been too blown to rest these bones for a long country mile\n\nSo let's get some cartoons and Vodka\n\nAnd put 'em on for a while\n\n\n\nOooh boy, now gimme some of that smile\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, oooh Oooh boy, are you ready for some fun?\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, oooh \n\n\n\nOooh boy, are you ready for some fun?\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, oooh Oooh boy, are you ready for some fun?\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down, drink 'em down, oooh \n\n\n\nOooh, drink them down, drink 'em down, oooh, drink them down\n\nOh, oh, drink 'em down down down down down down down, oh, oh, oooh\n\n\n\nDrink 'em down, drink 'em down"
