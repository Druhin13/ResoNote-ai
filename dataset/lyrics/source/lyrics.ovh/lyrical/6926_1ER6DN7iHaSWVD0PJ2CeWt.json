  "lyrics": "Keep your eyes open and prick up your ears \nrehearse your loudest cry. \nThere's folk out there who would do you harm \nso I'll sing you no lullaby. \nThere's a lock on the window; there's a chain on the door: \na big dog in the hall. \n\nBut there's dragons and beasties out there in the night \n\nto snatch you if you fall. \n\nSo come out fighting with your rattle in hand. \n\nThrust and parry. Light \n\na match to catch the devil's eye. Bring \n\na cross of fire to the fight. \n\n\n\nAnd let no sleep bring false relief \n\nfrom the tension of the fray. \n\nCome wake the dead with the scream of life. \n\nDo battle with ghosts at play. \n\n\n\nGather your toys at the call-to-arms \n\nand swing your big bear down. \n\nUpon our necks when we come to set \n\nyou sleeping safe and sound. \n\n\n\nIt's as well we tell no lie \n\nto chase the face that cries. \n\nAnd little birds can't fly \n\nso keep an open eye. \n\nIt's as well we tell no lie \n\nso I'll sing you no lullaby."
