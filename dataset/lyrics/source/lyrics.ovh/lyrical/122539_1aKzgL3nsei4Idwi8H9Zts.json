I take it offensive\n\n'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy\n\nThat popped up on the scene\n\nFeeling better, better than ever\n\n'Cause your umbrella, -brella (-brel-la)\n\nSun is beaming on me like headlights beaming on Bambi\n\nNow let's pretend the street is the room\n\nAnd you are a Camry, 'cause you drive me candy\n\nThe Tito to my Randy, now let's produce some thrillers\n\nMy chocolate wit' yo' vanilla, uh\n\n\n\nThe sun'll come out\n\nNothing good ever comes easy\n\nI know times are rough\n\nBut winners don't quit\n\nSo don't you give up\n\nThe sun'll come out\n\nBut we've been struggling endless days\n\nSomeday we'll find the love\n\n'Cause after the storm...\n\n\n\nI know it's hard\n\nBut did you even really try?\n\nMaybe you could understand\n\nWhen all you had to do was ask\n\nAnd just open your mind\n\nWhen everything is passing by\n\nAnd all you had to do was try\n\nYeah, all you had to was try\n\n\n\nTry, try, try, try, try\n\nAnd all you had to do was try\n\nTry, try, try, try"
