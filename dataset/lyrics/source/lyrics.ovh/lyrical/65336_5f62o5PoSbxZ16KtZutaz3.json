  "lyrics": "Â© Jody Reynolds / Delores Nance\r\nUniversal Polygram International Publishing Inc.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark, rain falling down\r\nLooked for my baby she's nowhere around\n\nTraced her footsteps down to the shore\n\n'Fraid she's gone forever more\n\n\n\nI looked at the sea and it seemed to say\n\nI took your baby from you away\n\nI heard a voice crying in the deep\n\nCome join me baby in my endless sleep\n\n\n\nWhy did we quarrel, why did we fight\n\nWhy did I leave her alone tonight\n\nThat's why her footsteps ran into the sea\n\nThat's why my baby is gone from me\n\n\n\nI looked at the sea and it seemed to say\n\nI took your baby from you away\n\nI heard a voice crying in the deep\n\nCome join me baby in my endless sleep\n\n\n\nRan in the water, heart full of fear\n\nThere in the breakers I saw her near\n\nReached for my baby, held her to me\n\nStole her back from the endless sleep\n\n\n\nI looked at the sea and it seemed to say\n\nYou took your baby from me away\n\nMy heart cried out, she's mine to keep\n\nI saved my baby from that endless sleep"
