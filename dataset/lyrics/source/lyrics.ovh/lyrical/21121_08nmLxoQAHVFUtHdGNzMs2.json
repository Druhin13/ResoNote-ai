  "lyrics": "Oh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart\nYou're never satisfied until the teardrops start\nI tried to shower you with love and kisses\nBut all I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'\nMy poor heart is saggin'\n\n\nThe way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame\n\nI'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same\n\nYou're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart\n\nOh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart\n\n\n\nNo, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart\n\nYou're never satisfied until the teardrops start\n\nI tried to shower you with love and kisses, baby\n\nAll I ever get from you is naggin' and braggin'\n\nMy poor heart is saggin'\n\n\n\nThe way you toss my heart around's, is a cryin' shame\n\nI'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same\n\nYou're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart\n\nBabe, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart\n\n\n\nThe way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame\n\n(Oh, yes)\n\nI'll bet you wouldn't like it if I did the same\n\nYou only tearing all my little dreams apart\n\nOh, you won't be satisfied until you break my heart"
