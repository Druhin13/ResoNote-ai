Nobody, but I do\n\nBut you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you\n\nI'll get you out my mind, mhm, I tried to\n\nBut I just want to stand and yell\n\nI will never dare to tell\n\nThink I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself\n\nIs this real? (Is this real?)\n\n\n\nBefore you speak, don't move\n\n‘Cause I don't wanna wake up\n\nWake up, wake up, wake up\n\nDon't wanna wake up, oh no\n\nWake up, wake up, wake up\n\n'Cause you're such a dream if you can believe\n\nYou're such a dream to me, mmm, boy\n\n\n\nI could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you\n\nBefore your boy gets smart, I would never try to\n\nYou know I'm thinking to myself, \"What happened, why you?\"\n\nBut when I see you in my dreams, psh, I knew\n\nYou know how to treat it, you know how to eat it\n\nYou know how to beat it (I know how to keep it)\n\nThe Good Housekeeping Seal\n\n(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)\n\nI don't just wanna touch you\n\nI'm tryna turn two single people into a couple\n\nWhat's your next month like? Tell me what ya up to\n\nWe can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffle\n\nWhat about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret\n\nBoy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh\n\n\n\nBefore you speak, don't move\n\n‘Cause I don't wanna wake up\n\nWake up, wake up, wa-wake up\n\nWake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up\n\nOh, I don't wanna\n\n\n\n'Cause you're such a dream (does this end?)\n\nIf you can believe, you're such a dream to me\n\nTo me, mmm, boy, to me"
