That's an awesome family\"\n\nNow let your flower bloom on an afternoon\n\nFive hours later I was walking with Tammy\n\nDown Rodeo Drive, she was looking so fancy\n\nShe said, \"If you love me, you will buy me this Louis\n\nVuitton,\" I said, \"Boo, I will see you soon\"\n\nI'm gone, she [?] song\n\nTryna penetrate my water while you tagging along\n\nI only known you for a week, I met you on a tweet\n\nA hundred forty characters, I think your talk is cheap\n\nYou slid in my DMs, and said you wanting my physique\n\nI said nah girl, that's cool, I was just looking for a freak\n\nEither the booty is talking to me, or I'm too high\n\nI got too many things to do, I think I'm running out of time\n\n\n\nCome on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\nBaby come on, come on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\nCome on, come on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\nBaby come on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\n\n\nI'm running out of time\n\nI'm running out of time\n\nI'm running out of time\n\nI'm running out of time\n\n\n\nAs time goes ticking by\n\nI wish we could (spending time, spending time)\n\nJust to show [?] wind blows by, I know I could\n\n(No doubt about it, no doubt about it)\n\nBut there's something I like about the way you move (No, no)\n\nSo I hopped on the right track, the thought I'll see you soon\n\n\n\nCome on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\nBaby come on, come on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\nCome on, come on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\nBaby come on, come on and throw your ass out\n\nCome on, come on don't throw your back out\n\n\n\nI'm running out of time\n\nI'm running out of time\n\nI'm running out of time\n\nI'm running out of time\n\n\n\nDude, you're a fucking dweeb"
