  "lyrics": "(James Pankow)\r\nTake a closer look inside yourself\r\nYou may see the love I left behind\r\nDays were fast but full of life\r\nWe laughed at everything\n\nNow you've gone time is standing still\n\nI don't do anything I'm so alone\n\nSo lonely\n\nStill I can recall\n\nThe happy times\n\nLaughing arm and arm\n\nSo alive\n\nWas it years ago\n\nOr just a day\n\nWhen you turned to me\n\nSaid goodbye\n\nNow you've gone away\n\nI don't know why\n\nDid you have to lie\n\nWalk away\n\nHow can I go on\n\nIn emptiness\n\nFeeling so alone\n\nEvery day"
