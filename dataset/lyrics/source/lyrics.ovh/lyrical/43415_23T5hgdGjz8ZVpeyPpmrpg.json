  "lyrics": "It happened in December\r\nIn the days when things get sad for no reason\r\nStrangers share a drink called loneliness\r\nAnd this city turns into the coldest place\r\nThen I keep you in mind from time to time\r\nI resist to scream your name out loud\n\nI'm sorry I gave you everything I had\n\nWithout making sure you ever desired it...\n\n\n\nPeople get tired of being sad, being pushed aside\n\nAnd then they leave, even though they promised they would not\n\nAnd it's not as if I did not try, but somewhere between being who you needed\n\nAnd being who I should become, I became a stranger to us both\n\n\n\nTeach your heart how to cherish the people around you before they depart\n\nYou know they surely will, if not by a choice, death steals them away\n\nAnd you'll have the remains of your life to dwell in regrets\n\nCause the gallows won't disappear, and for sure the graves won't fill\n\nAnd for sure the graves won't fill...\n\n\n\nThis is the death of our youths\n\nThe requiem to our dreams\n\nAlmost thirty summers passed\n\nAnd dropped down on me like fallen leaves\n\nNo, we didn't even ask for happiness... just a little less pain\n\nNow we sing and drink besides the graves we've dug\n\n\n\nPerhaps one day we will meet again\n\nTwo stars colliding for another time\n\nRecognizing the pieces of ourselves\n\nWe left behind in each other's heart\n\nSo search for me in the pitch black night\n\nWhen the stars hide behind the clouds\n\nAnd my heart longs for you\n\nWhatever you do... search for me\n\n\n\nSteal my heart in autumn, where I fall in love by time\n\nWe roam the fields together, counting stars and fighting sleep\n\nNo, I'm not feeling better yet, it seems I just got used to the words\n\nCause the gallows won't disappear, and for sure the graves won't ever fill\n\n\n\nThis was the death of our youths\n\nThis was the requiem to our dreams\n\nAlmost thirty summers passed\n\nAnd dropped down on me like fallen leaves\n\nNo, we didn't even ask for happiness, no, just a little less pain\n\nThis is where we sing and drink besides the graves we've dug...\n\nBesides the graves we've dug..."
