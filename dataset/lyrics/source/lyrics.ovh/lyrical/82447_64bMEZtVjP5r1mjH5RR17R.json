  "lyrics": "And now I'm all alone again \nNowhere to turn, no one to go to \nWithout a home without a friend \nWithout a face to say hello to \nAnd now the night is near \nI can make believe he's here \n\n\n\nSometimes I walk alone at night \n\nWhen everybody else is sleeping \n\nI think of him and I'm happy \n\nWith the company I'm keeping \n\nThe city goes to bed \n\nAnd I can live inside my head \n\n\n\nOwn my own \n\nPretending he's beside me \n\nAll alone \n\nI walk with him till morning \n\nWithout him \n\nI feel his arms around me \n\nAnd when I lose my way I close my eyes \n\nAnd he has found me \n\n\n\nIn the rain the pavement shines like silver \n\nAll the lights are misty in the river \n\nIn the darkness, the trees are full of starlight \n\nAnd all I see is him and me forever and forever \n\n\n\nAnd I know it's only in my mind \n\nThat I'm talking to myself and not to him \n\nAnd although I know that he is blind \n\nStill I say, there's a way for us \n\n\n\nI love him \n\nBut when the night is over \n\nHe is gone \n\nThe river's just a river \n\nWithout him \n\nThe world around me changes \n\nThe trees are bare and everywhere \n\nThe streets are full of strangers \n\n\n\nI love him \n\nBut every day I'm learning \n\nAll my life \n\nI've only been pretending \n\nWithout me \n\nHis world would go on turning \n\nA world that's full of happiness \n\nThat I have never known \n\n\n\nI love him \n\nI love him \n\nI love him \n\nBut only on my own."
