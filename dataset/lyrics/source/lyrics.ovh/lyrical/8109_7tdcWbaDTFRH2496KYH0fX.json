  "lyrics": "Oh now mama, could you bend your ear for just a tiny minute?\r\nI’m afraid I’m goin crazy again, could you spare me a little perspective?\r\nSee, I’m having all these visions, ma, but I don’t want you to worry\r\nAnd there’s this girl that I must’ve been wild about in some long-distance point in my history\r\nAnd I saw her last night with a handsome young man\n\nShe was glowing to me, is she glowing to him?\n\nAnd mama she was famous in my dreams\n\n\n\nAnd on a good night, can you keep a secret in the low light?\n\nWhere heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream\n\nIn between the needles and the pins\n\nWhere you and I go walkin’ in our sleep\n\nMm-mm\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t mind, the empty hours, I’m learning to sit with my demons\n\nBeen itching to write up this book again, but it’s so hard explaining the fevers\n\nI’m workin’ to live with the livin’, ma, cause I spent too many years running\n\nAnd I just want to find somebody designed with the same old electricity humming\n\n\n\nAnd I saw her last night with a handsome young man\n\nShe was perfect to me, is she perfect to him?\n\nAnd mama she was famous in my dreams\n\n\n\nAnd on a good night, can you keep a secret in the low light?\n\nWhere heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream\n\nIn between the needles and the pins\n\nWhere you and I go walkin’ in our sleep\n\nWhere you and I go walkin’ in our sleep\n\n\n\nIf you see her, see em waitin on the fireworks\n\nI’m waitin on this sunbird, I’m waitin on the fireworks\n\n\n\nAnd on a good night, well can you keep a secret in the low light?\n\nWhere heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream\n\nYes, I will find you in a dream\n\n\n\nAnd on a good night, can you keep a secret in the low light?\n\nWhere heaven meets the ocean, I will find you in a dream\n\nIn between the needles and the pins\n\nWhere you and I go walkin’ in our sleep (x2)\n\nHoney, ain’t this life, woah\n\nHoney, ain’t this life a pretty little dream?\n\nHoney, ain’t this life a pretty little dream?"
