  "lyrics": "I tried hard to make you want me\r\nBut we're not supposed to be\r\nAnd the truth will always haunt me\r\nEven though it set me free\r\nAnd my tears flow like the ocean\n\nAs they floated in the breeze\n\nThey were falling in slow motion\n\nAnd they brought me to my knees, oh\n\n\n\nYou're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain\n\nTurn off the light and now all that remains\n\nFills me with doubt and I'm shouting your name out loud\n\nWhy do you wanna put me through the pain?\n\nI get the feeling I'll never escape\n\nI can't hide away from the shame of you, oh\n\n\n\nTears on the ground, tears on my pillow\n\nYou won't bring me down\n\nAnd I'll get over you (I'll get over you)\n\nThese tears will get me through\n\nAnd I'll get over you\n\n\n\nI, I, I'll get over you\n\nI, I, oh yeah\n\nI, I, I'll get over you\n\nI, I, I'll get over you\n\n\n\nWhen did you lose your emotion?\n\nWhen did you become so cruel?\n\nAnd if you want to cut me open\n\nSays a thousands words 'bout you\n\n\n\nAnd in time I know you'll leave me\n\nLike a distant memory\n\nI know love can be so easy\n\nIf I start by loving me, oh\n\n\n\nYou're haunting me, taunting me all in my brain\n\nTurn off the light and now all that remains\n\nFills me with doubt and I'm shouting your name out loud\n\nWhy do you wanna put me through the pain?\n\nI get the feeling I'll never escape\n\nI can't hide away from the shame of you, oh\n\n\n\nTears on the ground, tears on my pillow\n\nYou won't bring me down\n\nI'll get over you (I'll get over you, I'll get over you...) oh\n\nTears on the ground, rain at my window\n\nThe pain washes out\n\nAnd I'll get over you\n\nThese tears will get me through\n\nAnd I'll get over you\n\n\n\nI'll get over you\n\nI, I, I'll get over you\n\nI, I, I'll get over you\n\nI don't need you to call me tonight (I'll get over you)\n\nI don't need you to see if I'm alright (I'll get over you)\n\nYou left me, so leave me, I'm fine (I'll get over you)\n\nI'll be here getting on with my life, oh\n\n\n\nTears on the ground, tears on my pillow\n\nYou won't bring me down, I'll get over you\n\nRain at my window, the pain washes out\n\nI'll get over you, oh\n\n\n\nTears on the ground, rain at my window\n\nThe pain washes out\n\nAnd I'll get over you\n\nOh yeah, I'll get over you\n\n\n\nI'll get over\n\nI'll get over you"
