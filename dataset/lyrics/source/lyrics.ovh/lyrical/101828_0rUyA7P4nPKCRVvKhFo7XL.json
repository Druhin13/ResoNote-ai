  "lyrics": "I was alone, I took a ride, \nI didn't know what I would find there \nAnother road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there \nOoh, then I suddenly see you, \nOoh, did I tell you I need you \n\nEvery single day of my life \n\n\n\nYou didn't run, you didn't lie \n\nYou knew I wanted just to hold you \n\nAnd had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again \n\nFor I had told you \n\n\n\nOoh, you were meant to be near me \n\nOoh, and I want you hear me \n\nSay we'll be together every day \n\n\n\nGot to get you into my life \n\n\n\nWhat can I do, what can I be, \n\nWhen I'm with you I want to stay there \n\nIf I'm true I'll never leave \n\nAnd if I do I know the way there \n\n\n\nOoh, then I suddenly see you, \n\nOoh, did I tell you I need you \n\nEvery single day of my life \n\n\n\nGot to get you into my life \n\nGot to get you into my life \n\n\n\nI was alone, I took a ride, \n\nI didn't know what I would find there \n\nAnother road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there \n\n\n\nThen suddenly I see you, \n\nDid I tell you I need you..."
