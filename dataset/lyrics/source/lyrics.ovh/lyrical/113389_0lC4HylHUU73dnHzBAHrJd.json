  "lyrics": "When the night returns just like a friend\r\nWhen the evening comes to set me free\r\nWhen the quiet hours\r\nThat wait beyond the day\r\nMake peaceful sounds in me\n\nTook a drag from my last cigarette\n\nTook a drink from a glass of old wine\n\nI closed my eyes and I could make it real\n\nAnd feel it one more time\n\n\n\nCan you hear it, babe\n\nCan you hear it, babe\n\nFrom another time, from another place\n\nDo you remember it, babe\n\n\n\nAnd the radio played like a carnival tune\n\nAs we lay in our bed in the other room\n\nWhen we gave it away\n\nFor the sake of a dream in a penny arcade\n\nIf you know what I mean\n\nIf you know what I mean, babe\n\n\n\nAnd here's to the songs we used to sing\n\nAnd here's to the times we used to know\n\nIt's hard to hold them in our arms again\n\nBut hard to let them go\n\nDo you hear it, babe\n\nDo you hear it, babe\n\n\n\nIt was another time\n\nIt was another place\n\nDo you remember it, babe\n\n\n\nAnd the radio played like a carnival tune\n\nAs we lay in our bed in the other room\n\nWhen we gave it away\n\nFor the sake of a dream in a penny arcade\n\nIf you know what I mean\n\nIf you know what I mean\n\nIf you know what I mean\n\nIf you know what I mean\n\n\n\nIf you know what I mean, babe\n\nIf you know what I mean"
