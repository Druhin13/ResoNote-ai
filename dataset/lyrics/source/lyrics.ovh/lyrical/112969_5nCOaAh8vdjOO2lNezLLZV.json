(Plan our perfect lives together)\r\nHoly, holy, holy, holy (holy shit)\n\nYou mean to tell me tell me tell\n\nYou're tough to love when you don't love yourself, well\n\n\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\n\n\nMy less exciting features\n\nAre packed inside my body\n\nThey're crammed into the balcony\n\nThey're jamming up the lobby\n\nThey're falling out the window\n\nYou can see them crashing through the glass\n\nWhen I don't keep my lids closed\n\nAs the director flicks his wrist\n\nThe stagehand in the wing has got a silver chain he grips\n\nAnd when he lifts it opens up the velvet curtains of my lips\n\nAnd I say\n\n\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\n\n\nWe’re not looking to wish on a star\n\nWe’re no good at receiving the help\n\nWho the hell do you think that you are?\n\nTrying to make me believe in myself\n\nYou're like the sun in the summertime\n\nI know you are but what am I?\n\nI don't really wanna sound like a lullaby\n\nBut I think every family is a butterfly\n\nYou know, pretty from afar, pretty gross up close\n\nDon't pity what we are, it's mostly unhideous\n\nAnd I'm sitting at the bar with a beer\n\nSo cheers, come toast me\n\nGet cozy since we're both lonely\n\nWhy don't we leap and then go see\n\nWhat we become, when it's done it's done\n\nBut I'm not looking below, so don't ghost me\n\nAnd it's seeming like we're in agreement\n\nThat the demon that we're fighting isn't the exact same\n\nBut if we're teaming up and carrying the weight together\n\nWe can miss a bit of back pain\n\nAnd if you're into it then we can get up out the city\n\nIn a minute in the fast lane\n\nGet hitched in a chapel in Vegas\n\nMaybe get rich, life is a craps game\n\nAnd I take my cue, from you\n\nOn what you wanna do 'bout a last name\n\nIt's not so bad to be a Watsky\n\n\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\n\n\nThose fires in your attic that rage without permission\n\nSome days invade your living room or break out in the kitchen\n\nThey breeze right through the building\n\nThey just show up as they please\n\nAnd then retreat like grown up children\n\nWell how'd you like to split this L and\n\nTell me what you've witnessed\n\nIf the price of life is hell\n\nWell no one ever had to sell me on how nice a fire smells\n\n\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\n\n\nAnd there's so much I've been silent on\n\nBut I'll whisper every secret to you when this mic is gone\n\nAnd I know you'll listen (listen)\n\nAnd I know it's different (different)\n\nBut it gives me peace our missing pieces could be siblings\n\nThe rough nights, ain't leaving\n\nSo why the hell should we?\n\nAnd I say\n\n\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\nWelcome to the family\n\n\n\nYou deserve love (welcome to the family)\n\nYou deserve love (welcome to the family)\n\nYou deserve love (welcome to the family)\n\nYou deserve love\n\nYou deserve love (welcome to the family)\n\nYou deserve love (welcome to the family)\n\nYou deserve love (welcome to the family)"
