  "lyrics": "A sin to some, accident's dying\r\nThe desperate need to have it all\r\nBody snatchers, death for dining\r\nA floating house, mouth full of bones\r\nIt's the end of my bloodline\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy, it's mine\n\nIt's the end of my bloodline\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy, it's mine\n\n\n\nThere's little truth in power's timing\n\nIts desperate need to have it all\n\nOn my device, the silver lining\n\nMisplaced your faith, leave me alone\n\n\n\nIt's the end of my bloodline\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy, it's mine\n\nIt's the end of my bloodline\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy, it's mine\n\n\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy\n\n\n\nIt's the end of my bloodline\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy, it's mine\n\nIt's the end of my bloodline\n\nIt's mine and you're greedy, it's mine"
