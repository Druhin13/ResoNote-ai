  "lyrics": "Count it down from 10 to 1, faster than a firefly\r\nCallin' out to everyone, \"Are you dead or alive?\"\r\nQuicker than the curious, and brighter than a meteor\r\nNever knowing who to trust can make me insecure\r\nLet me clear my throat, let me catch my breath\r\nLet my heart bleed out till there's nothing left\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\n\n\nCount it down from 10 to 1, faster than a hurricane\n\nCallin' out to everyone, \"Are you mad or insane?\"\n\nQuicker when you're curious, and better once you realize\n\nFinding someone you can trust gets results, check your pulse\n\n\n\nLet me clear my throat, let me catch my breath\n\nLet my heart bleed out till there's nothing left\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\n\n\nSay it if you're one of us, the beaten and the furious\n\nInjustice and lies, for the very last time\n\nIt's all the same (Believe it or not), but this ain't a game (And I'll never stop)\n\nSo you better run for your life\n\n\n\nLet me clear my throat, let me catch my breath\n\nLet my heart bleed out till there's nothing left\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\n\n\nTo whom it may concern\n\nI won't crash and burn\n\nBurn, burn\n\nI won't crash and...\n\n\n\nLet me clear my throat, let me catch my breath\n\nLet my heart bleed out till there's nothing left\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\n\n\nAs the world collides and I fight for air\n\nAs I crash and burn like I just don't care\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\n\n\nCount it down from 10 to 1, quicker when your curious\n\nSay it if you're one of us, the beaten and the furious\n\nAre you mad or insane, mad or insane\n\nAre you mad or insane, you better run for your life\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant\n\nIt's my day to be brilliant"
