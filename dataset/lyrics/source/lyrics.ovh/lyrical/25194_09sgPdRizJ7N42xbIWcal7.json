(bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)\n\nI say that I could lose you\n\nJust watch me walk away (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)\n\n\n\nI could lose you in the morning\n\nI could lose you in the evening\n\nEven when I'm sleeping\n\nIt seems I can't get no release\n\nYou think you're winning\n\nBut there's no competition\n\nEither way the decisions\n\nAlways come back to me, yeah\n\n\n\nDon't think I've been missing\n\nThe kisses on my neck\n\nThe way your arms surround me\n\nWhen we're laying in my bed\n\nThere ain't no denying\n\nIf I was still the best\n\nBut I could always lose you\n\nThat's what I said\n\n\n\nI know I could lose you (yeah, ah)\n\nDo you hear what I said? (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)\n\nI say that I could lose you\n\nJust watch me walk away (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)\n\n\n\nI could lose you in the morning\n\nI could lose you in the evening\n\nEven when I'm sleeping\n\nIt seems I can't get no release\n\nYou think you're winning\n\nBut there's no competition\n\nEither way the decisions\n\nAlways come back to me, yeah\n\n\n\nAy-ay, ay-yeah\n\nDon't you run back to me, yeah\n\nAy-ay, yeah-yeah, ay-yeah\n\n\n\nI know I could lose you (yeah, ah)\n\nDo you hear what I said? (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)\n\nI say that I could lose you\n\nJust watch me walk away (bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)\n\n\n\nI could lose you in the morning\n\nI could lose you in the evening\n\nEven when I'm sleeping\n\nIt seems I can't get no release\n\nYou think you're winning\n\nBut there's no competition\n\nEither way the decisions\n\nAlways come back to me, yeah\n\n\n\nAy-ay, ay-yeah\n\nDon't you run back to me, yeah\n\nAy-ay, yeah-yeah, ay-yeah\n\nI could always lose you"
