  "lyrics": "I don't know if you fell, if you was ever standing\r\nBut from my vantage it's like a picture that's candid\r\nCaught off guard by the bandit who's stealing Christians I ran with\r\nThis race ain't for the swift yet it's tailored for the abandoned\r\nThis pain has made me ramble\r\nIt's like you gamble with life, roll seven then dismantle the dice\n\nBet on heaven while you dance with the price\n\nI read the Scriptures with you, you even handled it right\n\nSaw the Christ in every text, said exegetical sight\n\nYou knew the devil was a liar, what happened to you?\n\nI seen him on your snapchat, you act like you happy, is you?\n\nSure you don't remember 'bout the fire, I'm glad to get you back\n\nAll them sermons that you preached about Adam in you\n\nI guess them genetics sent you the wrong message\n\nThe wrong medic, you sick and the fix ingrown heaven\n\nYou stole leaven and mixed it with bricks and stone\n\nAs addicting it gets harder to love truth\n\nI get it, I love you and this what love do\n\n\n\nBoth feet off the ground now\n\nYou far away, you falling\n\nLights faded out\n\nIt's dark but never too far from him\n\nCome back to your first love\n\nCome back to your first love\n\nCome back to your first love\n\n\n\nI don't know if you fell, if you was ever standing\n\nBut from my vantage I know you ain't plan it\n\nThis world ain't never random, it's mad strategic\n\nYou stopped eating what you really needed\n\nWas glad to leave it, was mad at me when I kept it honest\n\nSaid your conscience was precious\n\nLet you let the vomit etch and sketch away what you knew would profit\n\nYou left the promise, I promise it's true\n\nI know that blindness seems like knowledge to you\n\nIntelligence with hell in it, inhaling powers you knew\n\nRebellion better that's a lie from the bottom\n\nBetter yet the devil never tells a lie that he ain't swallow\n\nHow come you wallowed his name?\n\nYou switched in places with the god who was caine\n\nAnd bottled the shame that you carried\n\nBuried body, he raised you\n\nGotta be crazy cause you don't believe him\n\nYou don't believe him, you don't believe him\n\nThis life you leading, it's Christ you leaving\n\nDespite the grief in your heart of stone\n\nHe can roll it back, I remember when you told me that\n\nYou told me that\n\n\n\nBoth feet off the ground now\n\nYou far away, you falling\n\nLights faded out\n\nIt's dark but never too far from him\n\nCome back to your first love\n\nCome back to your first love\n\nCome back to your first love"
