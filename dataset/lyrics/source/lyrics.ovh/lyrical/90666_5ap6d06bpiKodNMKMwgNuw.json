  "lyrics": "Feel the heat, tension turned to 99 degrees\r\nTurn your back and mumble petty things\r\nPassive aggressive comments make me crazy\r\nSo crazy\r\nSo, don't you walk away from me\n\nLet's settle this, rather hear you scream\n\nThan whisper shit, there's no in-between\n\n'Cause if we sleep in our feelings, we'll never start healing\n\n\n\nLet's not go to bed angry\n\nTaking back everything I said\n\nBaby, let's not do this\n\nBaby, I don't wanna go to bed angry\n\n\n\nOut of sync, awkward silence like we skipped a beat\n\nWords that burn through the whiskey neat\n\nDon't tell me that it's fine that shit drives me crazy\n\nSo crazy\n\n\n\nSo, don't you walk away from me\n\nI don't wanna chase you, rather hear you scream\n\nThan ignore the issue, there's no in-between\n\n'Cause if we sleep in our feelings, we'll never start healing\n\n\n\nLet's not go to bed angry\n\nTaking back everything I said\n\nBaby, let's not do this\n\nBaby, I don't wanna go to bed angry\n\n\n\nPush and we pull, it's the bad side of good\n\nTrading blows, (Trading blows)\n\nHighs for lows (highs for lows)\n\nWhen we hurt just to heal\n\nShed a tear just to feel\n\nSo, we never have to sleep through the pain\n\n\n\nLet's not go to bed angry\n\nTaking back everything I said\n\nBaby, let's not do this\n\nBaby, I don't wanna go (Don't go)\n\nTo bed (To bed)\n\nAngry (Let's not go)\n\nTo bed angry (Woah, no)\n\nTaking back (Taking back)\n\nEverything I said\n\nBaby, let's not do this (Let's not do this)\n\nBaby, I don't wanna go (Don't go)\n\nTo bed (To bed)\n\nAngry\n\n\n\nAngry, angry, angry"
