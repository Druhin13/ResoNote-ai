  "lyrics": "Last fire will rise\r\nBehind those eyes\r\nBlack house will rock\r\nBlind boys don't lie\r\nImmortal fear\r\nThat voice so clear\n\nThrough broken walls\n\nThat scream I hear!\n\n\n\nCry, little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)\n\nCome, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)\n\nUnchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)\n\nLove is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)\n\n\n\nBlue masquerade\n\nStrangers look on\n\nWhen will they learn\n\nThis loneliness?\n\nTemptation heat\n\nBeats like a drum\n\nDeep in your veins\n\nI will not lie\n\n\n\nLittle sister! (Thou shalt not fall)\n\nCome, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)\n\nUnchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)\n\nLove is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)\n\n\n\nMy Shangri-Las\n\nI can't forget\n\nWhy you were mine\n\nI need you now!\n\n\n\nCry, little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)\n\nCome, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)\n\nUnchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)\n\nLove is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)\n\nCry, little sister! (Thou shalt not fall)\n\nCome, come to your brother! (Thou shalt not die)\n\nUnchain me, sister! (Thou shalt not fear)\n\nLove is with your brother! (Thou shalt not kill)"
