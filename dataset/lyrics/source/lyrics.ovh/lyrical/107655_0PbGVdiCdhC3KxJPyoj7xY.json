  "lyrics": "All or nothing that you say will make me stay\r\nMisguided by your loss and burning\r\nOh, you can't turn your eyes, you're glued to me\r\nSo if you don't like what you see\r\nAll on fire, please bring water\n\n\n\nWe'll soon find out who we are when all goes dark\n\nThese broken hearts and promises that always fade and never start\n\nHave come apart\n\n\n\nSo, no longer me, no longer known\n\nDo these moments on display suffice your need?\n\nPlease forgive me if I disagree\n\nBut your glimpse is now my nightmare\n\n\n\nAll on fire, oh no, please bring water\n\n\n\nWe'll soon find out who we are, alone in the dark\n\nThese broken hearts and promises that always fade and never start\n\nHave come apart\n\n\n\nAll is lost and turned away\n\nFrom out of my head and into the fray\n\nPlease make sure my door is closed when no one is home, no one\n\n\n\nSweet Phantom, know now that I respect\n\nYour cautious pentaamine\n\nBetween what's said and what was meant\n\nA shifting paradigm\n\n\n\nBelieve, my lover, it's time I disconnect\n\nAnd find the end result\n\nCome slither, you snake, please bring me back\n\nTo when life was wonderful\n\n\n\nThis heart of mine divides\n\nNo longer do I, do I. No longer do I, do I\n\nWhen you want it, it waits\n\nIf you want it, it waits\n\nNo longer do I, do I. No longer do I, do I\n\n\n\nCause all on fire, oh no, please bring water\n\nOh no, please bring, please bring water, please bring water\n\nAll on fire, oh no, please bring water\n\nOh no, please bring, please bring water, please bring water\n\n\n\nWe'll soon find out who we are, alone in the dark\n\nThese broken hearts and promises that always fade and never start\n\nHave come apart\n\n\n\nWe'll soon find out who we are, alone in the dark\n\n(Please bring)\n\nThese broken hearts and promises that always fade and never start\n\nHave come apart\n\n(Please bring water, please bring water)"
