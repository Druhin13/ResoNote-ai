  "lyrics": "She like fancy cars, I got fancy cars too\r\nShe want a movie star, well I'm a movie star too\r\nShe wanna fall apart, just to know someone can pull her together\r\nShe wanna break my heart, knowing that no one can make it all better\r\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say\n\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say\n\nCome on tell me, but you don't know me\n\nCome on tell me, you don't love me, you can't love me\n\n\n\nI've been getting on, are you getting on too\n\nIf I'm what you want, why you put it on you\n\nShe wanna leave a mark, just to know someone will always remember\n\nShe wanna break these hearts, but nothing and no one can make it all better\n\n\n\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say\n\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say\n\nCome on tell me, but you don't know me\n\nCome on tell me, you don't know me, you can't love me\n\n\n\nYou can't love me\n\nYou don't know me\n\nYou don't know me\n\n\n\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say\n\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say\n\nCome on tell me, that you don't know me\n\nCome on tell me, that you don't know me, you can't love me\n\n\n\nWhat did you want to say, is that what you want to say\n\nBefore you walk away, is that all you want to say"
