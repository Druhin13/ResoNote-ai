  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Bad Guy par Niykee Heaton\r\nI said, \"I love you\" first\nStanding in your kitchen wearing nothing but your favorite shirt\nAnd that's what makes this hurt\n'Cause right now you're only remember-remembering the worst\n\nAnd I hate this, yeah, I hate it\nThat we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way\nAnd I hate that, that you hate me\nThat we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way\n\nYou, you, you can call me the bad guy\nIf it helps you sleep at night\n\nOh, oh, wouldn't be the first time\nThat you made me the bad guy\nYou think you're the only one hurt\nAnd that's the reason why we don't work\nYou, you, you can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\n\nI always put you first\nSo why did you make me feel like I came in third?\nAnd you have the nerve\nTo blame me for something you know I don't deserve, no\n\nAnd I hate this, yeah, I hate it\nThat we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way\nAnd I hate that, that you hate me\n\nThat we're ending so ugly, didn't have to be this way\n\nYou, you, you can call me the bad guy\nIf it helps you sleep at night\nOh, oh, wouldn't be the first time\nThat you made me the bad guy\nYou think you're the only one hurt\nAnd that's the reason why we don't work\nYou, you, you can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\n\nWe got different version, but that's alright\nThat's alright, that's alright\n'Cause I know that deep down you know I tried\nAnd you know why I said goodbye, so\n\n\nYou, you, you can call me the bad guy\nIf it helps you sleep at night\nOh, oh, wouldn't be the first time\nThat you made me the bad guy\nYou think you're the only one hurt\nAnd that's the reason why we don't work\nYou, you, you can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy\nYou can call me the bad guy"
