  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Anthem par Hardwell\r\nYa, ya\nSo get ready for the heat\nGet ready for the beat\nGet ready for the madness\nLet's go, let's go\n\nGet ready for the crowd\nTo be shot and get down\nI say it's gonna be catches\nAu! (au!)\nGet ready for the drop\nWhen I step in the spot\nIt's lights, camera, action\nTurn it up, tryna cause a reaction\n\nHands in the sky, get ready for the anthem\n\nHands in the sky, get ready for the anthem\nHands in the sky, get ready for the anthem\n\nAu!\nWe turnin' up, we flying through the galaxy\nWe're so in love, we living in a fantasy\nWe're burnin' up, with hands up in the sky until we all fall down\nFall down-down-down\n\nWe turnin' up, we flying through the galaxy\nWe're so in love, we living in a fantasy\nWe're burnin' up, with hands up in the sky until we all fall down\nFall down\nFall down\n\nYa, ya\n\nSo get ready for the heat\nGet ready for the beat\nGet ready for the madness\nLet's go, let's go\n\nGet ready for the crowd\nTo be shot and get down\nI say it's gonna be catches\nAu! (au!)\nGet ready for the drop\nWhen I step in the spot\nIt's lights, camera, action\nTurn it up, tryna cause a reaction\n\nHands in the sky, get ready for the anthem\nHands in the sky, get ready for the anthem\nHands in the sky, get ready for the anthem"
