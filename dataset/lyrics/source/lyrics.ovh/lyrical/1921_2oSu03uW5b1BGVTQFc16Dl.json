  "lyrics": "Grandpa wore his suit to dinner\r\nNearly every day\r\nNo particular reason\r\nHe just dressed that way\r\nBrown necktie and a matching vest\r\nAnd both his wingtip shoes\n\nHe built a closet on our back porch\n\nAnd put a penny in a burned out fuse.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nGrandpa was a carpenter\n\nHe built houses stores and banks\n\nChain smoked Camel cigarettes\n\nAnd hammered nails in planks\n\nHe was level on the level\n\nAnd shaved even every door\n\nAnd voted for Eisenhower\n\n'Cause Lincoln won the war.\n\n\n\nWell, he used to sing me\n\n\"Blood on the Saddle\"\n\nAnd rock me on his knee\n\nAnd let me listen to radio\n\nBefore we got TV\n\nWell, he'd drive to church on Sunday\n\nAnd take me with him too!\n\nStained glass in every window\n\nHearing aids in every pew.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nNow my grandma was a teacher\n\nWent to school in Bowling Green\n\nTraded in a milking cow\n\nFor a Singer sewing machine\n\nShe called her husband \"Mister\"\n\nAnd walked real tall and pride\n\nAnd used to buy me comic books\n\nAfter grandpa died.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:"
