  "lyrics": "I know you, and you ain't you\r\nHere I sit between the two\r\nVersions of a person any fool can see\r\nSomethin's stirrin' in your heart\r\nI can feel it in the dark\r\nIn our bed and in the car and all that's in between\n\n\n\nI don't know what you can't say\n\nSay somethin', say anything\n\n\n\nWhat about now?\n\nDon't wait, don't waste another minute\n\nForget about how my world will be without you in it\n\nYou got some things you need to figure out\n\nSo what about now?\n\n\n\nYou can say there's someone else\n\nOr you need time to find yourself\n\nOr maybe this just never felt the way that it's s'posed to\n\nI don't wanna hear goodbye\n\n'Cause this old thing is worth the fight\n\nCome on now, we have to try\n\nIt's really up to you\n\n\n\nI don't know what you can't say\n\nSay somethin', say anything\n\n\n\nWhat about now?\n\nDon't wait, don't waste another minute\n\nForget about how my world will be without you in it\n\nYou got some things you need to figure out\n\nOh, you got some things you need to figure out\n\nSo what about now?"
