  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson In a Year of 13 Moons par Current Joys\r\nYou realize it’s all the same\nPeople learn a lot in difficult ways\nThey're out there calling your name\nThere’s not much left time can rip away\n\nJust how long\nMust I wait\nTry to keep your control\nBut it’s already gone away\n‘Cause in the year of thirteen moons\nThings are way too hard to take\n\nIt away\n\nThere’s something outside this room\nAnd I can get out but I can’t get through\n\nThe stars are calling for you\nI’m terrified that they’ll take you too soon\n\nNow, you’re so far\nAway\nTry to keep my control\nBut there’s just so much I can’t take\nIt’s been a year since I’ve seen you\nAnd I’m just waiting for the moon\n\nTo change"
