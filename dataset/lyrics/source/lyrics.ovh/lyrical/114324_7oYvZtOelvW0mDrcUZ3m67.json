Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down)\n\nThe effects can't touch this\n\n(Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down)\n\nStepped up, step down, bitch\n\n(Woo! Simmer down, simmer down, simmer down, simmer down)\n\nWait, wait, wait\n\n\n\nI'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I\n\nI ain't ever been the one that's scared of you\n\nBaby, you can come and get it\n\nI'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I\n\nBaby, when the karma gets you\n\nMaybe you can run away with us\n\n\n\nIn my bag in the vault, moving on, move along\n\nAin't it my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt\n\nGot back on the road, and made it to the start\n\nDisregarding the emotional discharge\n\nCan't forget the mission, put into my heart\n\nI ain't playing games, need you to play your part\n\nStanding up with pride behind my battle scars\n\n\n\nMoney walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable\n\nBig ass house and big ass car don't add up when you die alone\n\nI want white knights like five lights for some little chromes\n\nI want bliss, no strife\n\nRewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies\n\nI want a better life, bend around the corner\n\nOne deep, eyes shut when they know the place\n\nBut you don't know me, I don't correlate\n\nStraight from manipulation wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers\n\nStill wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone\n\nAlways throwing curve, like a reaper scythe\n\nGnawing on my wood like a termite\n\nEntering my world like a parasite\n\n(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)\n\n\n\nPraise God, hallelujah! I'm still depressed\n\nAt war with my conscience, paranoid, can't find that shit\n\nWoo, praise God, hallelujah! I'm still depressed\n\nAt war with my conscience, paranoid, I can'tâ€”\n\n\n\nLet me find my way out of this bitch\n\nI'm Sammy-jo, and my favorite colors are black and red (Damn)\n\nWith a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin'\n\nIf I can't find time to get my heart out\n\nWould you stomp 'em out when we slow the word down?\n\nWould you hold it down for me when my heart pound?\n\nAin't no telling, no telling so call the coroner\n\n\n\nSittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you\n\nLight it up better dodge the cops\n\nAnd I'll never get sick of playing with your locks\n\nI- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-\n\nSittin' on your porch, across parking lots\n\nThat's all I got for you\n\nAnd I'll never get sick of playing with your locks I- I-\n\nThat's all I got for you\n\nSittin' on your porch, across parking lots and you\n\nThat's all I got for you\n\nMiss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-\n\nThat's all I got for you\n\nSittin' on your porch, across parking lots\n\nThat's all I got for you\n\nAnd I'll never get sick of playing with your locks\n\nI- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots\n\nI- I- miss you lots, I- I- miss you lots, I- I-\n\nThat's all I got for you"
