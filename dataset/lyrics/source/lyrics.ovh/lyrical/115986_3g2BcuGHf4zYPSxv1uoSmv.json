  "lyrics": "I can't expect you to be honest\r\nOr to be faithful every day 'til the end\r\nI just need you to always be a friend\r\nAs the sun sets over Dakotas\r\nUnderneath a crimson ocean of sky\r\nKnow I'll always want you be my side\n\nWhen we drive\n\n\n\nYou and I were born in motion\n\nNever in one place for too long a time\n\nAnd now it's the only way we know to survive\n\nI like the way your hair tangles\n\nThe way your sun tan's only on one side\n\nWe always keep the windows open wide\n\nWhen we drive\n\n\n\nClimb into the back seat and close your eyes\n\nI've got the wheel\n\nAnd dream of all the places only we will find\n\n\n\nI can't expect you to be honest\n\nOr to be faithful every day 'til the end\n\nI just need you to always be a friend\n\nUntil the engine kicks and sputters\n\nUntil we roll the rubber off the tires\n\nKnow I'll always need you by my side\n\nWhen we drive"
