  "lyrics": "I was silent partner, I could use a shrink\r\nI heard you said the misfortune speech\r\nBut I have sympathy when you get up your seat\r\nBefore this mess becomes a disease\r\nI have cracked the code on this old machine\r\nTake thousands eyes to be released\n\nBut I've been wondering why can't you see?\n\nWhere the door opens up and go where it leads\n\n\n\nI have been waiting for you to find\n\nAll of this could be yours, be yours tonight!\n\nOoh oh oh (could be yours, could be yours)\n\nOoh oh oh (could be yours, could be yours)\n\nOoh oh oh (could be yours, could be yours)\n\n\n\nYou were packing up but I gave you a bed\n\nYou would rather crash, then go straight ahead\n\nI wrote this years ago, but it's finished today\n\nWith the help of a fan who was finished the same\n\n\n\nI have been waiting, but you would need a sign\n\nAll of this could be yours, be yours tonight!\n\nI have been patient, but you've got to try\n\nAll of this could be yours, be yours tonight!\n\nOoh oh oh (could be yours, could be yours)\n\nOoh oh oh (could be yours, could be yours)\n\nOoh oh oh (could be yours, could be yours)\n\n\n\nAll this could be yours\n\nAll this could be yours\n\nAll this could be yours\n\nCOULD BE YOURS\n\nAll this could be yours"
