  "lyrics": "Night time sharpens\r\nheightens each sensation\r\nDarkness stirs\r\nand wakes imagination\r\nSilently the senses\r\nabandon their defences\n\n\n\nSlowly, gently\n\nnight unfurls its splendour\n\nGrasp it, sense it \n\ntremulous and tender\n\nTurn your face away from the garish light of day\n\nTurn your thoughts from cold, unfeeling light\n\nAnd listen to the music of the night\n\n\n\nClose your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams\n\nTurn your thoughts from the life you knew before\n\nClose your eyes, let your spirit start to soar.\n\nAnd you'll live as you've never lived before. \n\n\n\nSoftly, deftly\n\nmusic shall caress you\n\nHear it, feel it\n\nsecretly possess you\n\nOpen up your mind\n\nlet your fantasies unwind\n\nin this darkness which\n\nyou know you cannot fight\n\nthe darkness of\n\nthe music of the night\n\n\n\nLet your mind start a journey through a strange new world.\n\nLeave all thoughts of the life you before. \n\nLet your soul take you where you long to be.\n\nOnly then can you belong to me.\n\n\n\nFloating, falling sweet intoxication!\n\nTouch me, trust me\n\nsavour each sensation.\n\n\n\nLet the dream begin\n\nlet your darker side give in\n\nto the power of the music that I write.\n\nThe power of the music of the night.\n\n\n\nYou alone can make my song take flight.\n\nHelp me make the music of the night."
