  "lyrics": "This dark winding road\r\nA long path ahead\r\nA sound in the distance of light escaping\r\nThrough the haze a silhouette\r\nA glimpse of reality\r\nOnly leading to nothing, where no light dwells\n\nI feel hope leaving\n\nI see love fading\n\nWhat I wanted to be, what I couldn't become\n\nIf you could find me, would you even know me?\n\nAn empty room, an empty heartbeat...\n\nI have found you in the darkness\n\nI have found you...\n\n\n\nAnd...and here you are\n\nTo set a brand new path...\n\nTo show me all that love means\n\n\n\nI was lost, lost at the edge of all reason\n\nAnd I...I didn’t know my way\n\nI’d given up hope\n\n\n\nBut...but, here you are to set a brand new path\n\nTo show me all that love means\n\n\n\nWhen I hold you, I need you\n\nI said forever, and I mean forever\n\n\n\nWhen I hold you, I need you\n\nI said forever, and I mean forever\n\n\n\nI was lost, lost at the edge of all reason\n\nAnd I...I didn’t know my way\n\nI’d given up hope\n\n\n\nBut...but here you are to show me a new way\n\nI didn't know love until your name\n\n\n\nBut here you are to set a brand new path\n\nTo show me all that love means\n\nWhen I hold you, I need you\n\nI said forever, I mean forever\n\n\n\nWhen I hold you, I need you\n\nI said forever, I mean forever\n\n\n\nI was waiting impatiently\n\nBut finally this moment has come\n\nTo see you, to feel you, this magic from far beyond\n\n\n\nCan you see it?\n\nCan you feel it?\n\nFinally you are in my arms\n\n\n\nOh real love\n\nMost real love\n\nI’ve died to be yours\n\n\n\nWhat was lost\n\nYour heart has found\n\nMost beautiful one\n\n\n\nCan you see it?\n\nCan you feel it?\n\nFinally in my arms\n\n\n\nCan you see it?\n\nCan you feel it?\n\nFinally you are in my arms\n\n\n\nOh real love\n\nMost real love\n\nI’ve died to be yours\n\n\n\nCan you see it?\n\nCan you feel it?\n\nFinally in my arms\n\n\n\nOh real love\n\nMost real love\n\nI’ve died to be yours\n\nCan you see it?\n\nCan you feel it?\n\nFinally in my arms\n\n\n\nOh real love\n\nMost real love\n\nI’ve died to be yours"
