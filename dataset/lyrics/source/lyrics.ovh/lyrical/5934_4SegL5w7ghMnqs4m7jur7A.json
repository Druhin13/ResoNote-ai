  "lyrics": "[BEFORE]\r\nMillions... watch them fly overhead\r\nNow please take me with you\r\nIâ€™ve lost my perspective\r\nYou left me alone\n\nAlone and trembling\n\nMy chin jolting back and forth... sounds soar around\n\nThe shield you once were... my life you would defend\n\nSounds soar around\n\n\n\nIn my world there is only us\n\nBring me with you to soar\n\nThis dreadful collapsing scent... you never strive for more\n\n\n\nMillions fly overhead\n\nFog dancing slavery... like snakes circling\n\nSmall angle jeopardy\n\n\n\nMillions"
