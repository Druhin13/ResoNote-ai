  "lyrics": "I was mixed up in the shadows casting over me\r\nBlending in the background of someone else's dream\r\nThen I caught your light, then I caught your glow\r\nDidn’t dim my shine, but you changed my tone\r\nNow I'm illuminated and you're all I see\n\nBaby, baby, you’re my color, custom made\n\nThink I finally discovered you're my perfect shade\n\n\n\nI stand out like neon on the darkest night\n\nEverything looks clearer looking in your eyes\n\nIt could be the all, it could the spring\n\nBaby, you look good with everything\n\nI've tried other designs, and boy, you fit just right\n\n\n\nBaby, baby, you're my color, custom made\n\nThink I finally discovered you're my perfect shade\n\n\n\nShades of green, shades of gold\n\nI don't need another rainbow\n\nShades of me, shades of you\n\nYou're the prism that I see through\n\n\n\nBaby, baby, you're my color, custom made\n\nThink I finally discovered you’re my perfect shade\n\n\n\nYou’re my perfect shade, yeah\n\nHey yeah\n\nHey, hey, hey yeah\n\nWhoa oh oh oh, whoa, mmm"
