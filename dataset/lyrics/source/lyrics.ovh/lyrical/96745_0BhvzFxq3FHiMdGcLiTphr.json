(Yeah)\n\nI remember you and me (You and me)\n\nClose as any two can be (Two can be)\n\nNow we're strangers in the night (In the night)\n\nAwkward and uptight\n\n\n\nOh baby, do you wanna make it better?\n\nUh, ha, do you wanna stay together?\n\nHey, if you do, then let's please\n\nMake some new memories\n\n\n\nWhen you take somebody for your own\n\nIt can't survive on history alone\n\nYeah, meet me at the hotel, motel\n\nThough we got a room at home\n\nGo to a place that we don't know so well\n\nIt be nice, add a lil' spice\n\nTry some new seduction (You and me)\n\nShow each other how (Show each other how)\n\nUh, give each other new instructions\n\nOn what makes us feel good now\n\nI just wanna make you feel good now\n\n(Uh, feel good, don't it? C'mon)\n\n\n\nDo you wanna make it better? (Yeah)\n\n(Just wanna make it right, c’mon)\n\nDo you wanna stay together? (Uh)\n\n(I meant when I said it)\n\nAnd it’s easier to run away\n\nThan to look for what would make you stay\n\nDo you wanna make it better?\n\n(Uh, feel good, don't it? C’mon)\n\nDo you wanna stay together? (Yeah)\n\n(Just wanna make it right, c'mon)\n\nIf you do, then let's please\n\nMake some new memories\n\nDo you wanna make it better?\n\n(Uh, feel good, don't it? C’mon)\n\nDo you wanna stay together? (Yeah)\n\nIf you do, then let's please (Just wanna make it right, c'mon)\n\nMake some new memories\n\nDo you wanna make it better?\n\n(Uh, feel good, don't it? C'mon)\n\nDo you want to stay together? (Yeah)\n\nIf you do, then let's please (Just wanna make it right, c'mon)\n\nMake some new memories\n\nDo you wanna make it better?\n\nDo you wanna stay together?"
