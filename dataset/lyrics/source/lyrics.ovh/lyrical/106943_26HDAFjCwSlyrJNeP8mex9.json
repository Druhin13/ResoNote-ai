  "lyrics": "It's not the long, flowing dress that you're in\r\nOr the light coming off of your skin\r\nThe fragile heart you protected for so long\r\nOr the mercy in your sense of right and wrong\r\nIt's not your hands searching slow in the dark\r\nOr your nails with your lover's watermark\n\nIt's not the way you talk me off the roof\n\nYour questions like directions to the truth\n\n\n\nIt's knowing that this can't go on forever\n\nLikely one of us will have to spend some days alone\n\nMaybe we'll get forty years together\n\nBut one day I'll be gone\n\nOr one day you'll be gone\n\n\n\nIf we were vampires and death was a joke\n\nWe'd go out on the sidewalk and smoke\n\nLaugh at all the lovers and their plans\n\nI wouldn't feel the need to hold your hand\n\nMaybe time running out is a gift\n\nI'll work hard 'til the end of my shift\n\nAnd give you every second I can find\n\nAnd hope it isn't me who's left behind\n\n\n\nIt's knowing that this can't go on forever\n\nLikely one of us will have to spend some days alone\n\nMaybe we'll get forty years together\n\nBut one day I'll be gone\n\nOr one day you'll be gone\n\n\n\nIt's knowing that this can't go on forever\n\nLikely one of us will have to spend some days alone\n\nMaybe we'll get forty years together\n\nBut one day I'll be gone\n\nOr one day you'll be gone"
