  "lyrics": "I know all of my exits\r\nI'm always plannin' my escape\r\nIt's the most aggressive symptom\r\nOf this collective phantom pain\r\nAnd the more that you ignore it\r\nThe more it makes you go insane\n\nJust look around\n\n\n\nIt's the battle of the passwords\n\nIt's the trumpets on the hill\n\nIt's that constant paranoia\n\nIt's the final fire drill\n\nAnd if you won't sing the anthem\n\nThey'll go find someone else who will\n\nThey're crackin' down\n\n\n\nWe're livin' in the future, so shine a little light\n\nIt may not make it any better, I'm just hopin' that it might\n\nI'm not talkin' 'bout forever, how 'bout just gettin' through the night?\n\nWe're livin' in the future, so shine a little light\n\n\n\nI'm always lookin' over shoulders\n\nNot knowin' what I’m lookin' for\n\nNow that the feelin' someone's watchin’\n\nIsn't just a feelin' anymore\n\nNow that both sides of the aisle\n\nAre this good at keepin' score\n\nWe've crossed a line\n\n\n\nThere's a madness to the method\n\nThere's a market for the fear\n\nIt's that dance out on the razor's edge\n\nThe wolf held by the ears\n\nIt's the man behind the curtain\n\nIt's the way of our frontiers\n\nSince the dawn of time\n\n\n\nWe're livin' in the future, so shine a little light\n\nIt may not make it any better, I'm just hopin' that it might\n\nI'm not talkin' 'bout forever, how 'bout just gettin' through the night?\n\nWe're livin' in the future, so shine a little light\n\n\n\nWe're livin' in the future, so shine a little light\n\nIt may not make it any better, I'm just hopin' that it might\n\nI'm not talkin' 'bout forever, how 'bout just gettin' through the night?\n\nWe're livin' in the future, so shine a little light"
