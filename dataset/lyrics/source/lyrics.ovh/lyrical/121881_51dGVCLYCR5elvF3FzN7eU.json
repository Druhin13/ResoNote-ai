  "lyrics": "I heard from a friend of a friend\r\nThat you been staying home a lot lately\r\nJust thought you should know you're not alone\r\nI've been driving myself crazy\r\nThinking about the good times\r\nBack when you were all mine\n\nWe were flying so high\n\nNothing but a blue sky\n\nAnd my passenger seat misses you with me\n\n\n\nI still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone\n\nI'll pick up the broken pieces\n\nI can pick you up\n\nI can pick you up\n\n\n\nDon't you think by now\n\nWe should've found some way to be over eachother\n\nMaybe our goodbye wasn't right\n\nYou and I ain't come and go lovers\n\nAin't no reason now for you to still be down\n\nI'm on your side of town\n\nCan you hear the sound of my engine running\n\nHey girl, I'm coming\n\n\n\nI still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone\n\nI'll pick up the broken pieces\n\nI can pick you, I can pick you up\n\nI dont remember where we lost it\n\nBut I miss when we were us\n\nLet's pick up right where we left off\n\nI can pick you, I can pick you up\n\nOh I can pick you up\n\n\n\nYou could stay down or I'll pick you up\n\nShut the world out or I'll pick you up\n\nComing over now, gonna pick you up\n\n\n\nI still got that '04 V6 and I ain't seeing anyone\n\nI'll pick up the broken pieces\n\nI can pick you, I can pick you up\n\nI dont remember where we lost it\n\nBut I miss when we were us\n\nLet's pick up right where we left off\n\nI can pick you, I can pick you up\n\nI can pick you up"
