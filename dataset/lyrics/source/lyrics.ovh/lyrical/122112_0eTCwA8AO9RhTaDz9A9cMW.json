  "lyrics": "I'm a bad man\r\nJames Dean, kinda Steve McQueen\r\nStraight out the bad lanes\r\nI rolled in and rained down\r\nLike a storm cloud or a heat wave\r\nMade you stay undercover where it's safe\n\nDon't give a damn about the plans you made\n\nWe're staying in the bed all day\n\n\n\nCause I'm selfish\n\nRestless like a river, can't help it\n\nI'm taking what you give me but I still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nCause I'm selfish\n\nYeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you\n\n\n\nHave you seen yourself in a full-length mirror\n\nSpinning around lately\n\nI'd lie, cheat, and steal\n\nFeel the sweet scent overtake me\n\nBut the Lord sent an angel to save me\n\nSo he can't blame me\n\nWhen my hands get a mind of their own\n\nGirl, if they get ahold of you, I ain't never letting go\n\n\n\nCause I'm selfish\n\nRestless like a river, can't help it\n\nI'm taking what you give me but I still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nCause I'm selfish\n\nYeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you\n\n\n\nOh, so selfish for you\n\nI still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nI still want more\n\n\n\nCause I'm selfish\n\nRestless like a river, can't help it\n\nI'm taking what you give me but I still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nCause I'm selfish\n\nYeah I'm selfish, I'm selfish for you\n\n\n\nStill want more\n\nI still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nI still want more\n\nI'm selfish for you"
