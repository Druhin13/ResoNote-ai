  "lyrics": "What can I do to make you think that I am just not over you?\r\nWhat can I say to make it right, again?\r\nWhere can I go to take a lost soul and get it safe again?\r\nIf I don’t have you then I’m left alone tonight\r\nWon't you stay, stay, stay\n\nDon’t let this slip away\n\nNot today\n\nWon't you cut me down\n\nYou can run around\n\nAll over town\n\nJust as long as you stay\n\n\n\nWhen did I ever take advantage of your sweet desire?\n\nHow could you think that I’m so cold, to you?\n\nDid I freeze you out of every situation?\n\nYou can drop the cards that I’m gonna fold\n\n\n\nWon't you stay, stay, stay\n\nDon’t let this slip away\n\nNot today\n\nWon't you cut me down\n\nYou can run around\n\nAll over town\n\nJust as long as you stay\n\n\n\nI won’t be a lesson, I wouldn’t be (as long as you stay)\n\nWhen were good\n\nThen were real good (as long as you stay)\n\nYou take my hand and you steal my heart\n\nAnd honey, hearing that to you was just a start\n\nYou can kick me up, but you can’t break us apart\n\n\n\nWon't you stay, stay, stay\n\nDon’t let this slip away\n\nNot today\n\nWon't you cut me down\n\nYou can run around\n\nAll over town\n\nJust as long as you stay\n\n\n\nYeah, you can run around\n\nAll over town\n\nYou get me up all night\n\nI only wanna make it right\n\n\n\nAs long as you stay"
