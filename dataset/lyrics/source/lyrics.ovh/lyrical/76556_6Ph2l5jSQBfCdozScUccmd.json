  "lyrics": "You lie still, the walls are closing in again\r\nUnable to summon any adrenaline\r\nWithout passion, limping on your last limb\r\nBut you'd still run from interaction\r\nCause all people do is pick at the scab\r\nBringing up a conflict that they think you may have\n\nSo, when they asked you laughed and lied\n\nAnd they were pacified but it was trapped inside\n\nWhen you were younger, man you would have mocked this\n\nCracked a snap and called it all softness\n\nBut look at you now, a walking ghost\n\nTrying to fight your way off the ropes\n\n\n\nBut in that room it's only you and all your secrets\n\nRemaining calm and you don't wanna fall to pieces\n\nBut when it's dark you just might start to get ideas\n\nYou'll say your strong and moving on\n\nBut you don't need this feeling\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nTonight we are the lonely ones\n\nThe lights go out the show is done\n\nSo lock your door and bite your tongue\n\nTonight we are the lonely ones\n\n\n\nThis time around I specifically wrote\n\nOn a slippery slope cause I typically joke\n\nSo here I'm am standing on the middle of the Grand Canyon\n\nWith no companion, echoes at random\n\nI'm alone with the shadows cold and scared\n\nIt's like losing sight when you're hearing impaired\n\nJust running (runnin) unseen like a sasquatch\n\nFeeling lost in the crash like the black box\n\nI keep thinking about all my flaws\n\nFrozen inside and I can't be thawed\n\nSo put me on an iceberg, push me away\n\nTo hide in the horizon fading to gray\n\n\n\nI'd like to get this off my chest, it's complicated\n\nI start to speak and feel relief but I can't say it\n\nI hide the truth or stay aloof and isolated\n\nAnd think I'm strong and moving on but I can't shake this feeling\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nTonight we are the lonely ones\n\nTonight we are the lonely ones\n\nTonight we are the lonely ones\n\nTonight we are alone\n\nWe are the lonely ones\n\nWe are the lonely ones\n\nWe are the lonely ones\n\nWe are the lonely ones\n\nWe are the lonely ones"
