  "lyrics": "Standing beside an open grave\r\nYou're fate decided, your life erased\r\nYour final hour has come today\r\nLit by the fire of your temples burning\r\nYou were a child and so was I\n\nNow you're a hunter but I am a lion\n\nAnd I will cut you down like I've done so many times\n\nBut sometimes bad can do some good\n\nSometimes bad can do some good\n\nSometimes bad can do some good\n\n\n\nAnd I heard you say that flesh sells by the pound\n\nWhen blood is raining down it cuts a deep river\n\nAnd I'm diving\n\n\n\nNow shine a light down onto the earth\n\nAnd shake this gold dust out, out of the dirt\n\nNo saints beside me and no prayers to guide me\n\nSometimes bad can do some good\n\nBad can do some good\n\nSometimes bad can do some good\n\n\n\n(Rain down, heaven is falling)\n\nI've chosen a side and I will show no pity\n\n(Rain down, heaven is falling)\n\nAnd spare no lives\n\nFor those who try me\n\n(Rain down, heaven is falling)\n\nLet it be understood\n\nSometimes bad can do some good\n\n(Rain down, heaven is falling)\n\nSometimes bad can do some good\n\n(Rain down, heaven is falling)\n\nSometimes bad can do some good"
