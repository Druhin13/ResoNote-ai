  "lyrics": "Wait\r\nKing of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland\r\nKing of the filthy, king of the fallen, we living again\r\nKing of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'\r\nKing of the past, present, future, my ancestors watching\n\nKing of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed\n\nKing of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect\n\nKing of the opps that miss it and dreamers that go and get it\n\nKing of the winners, district and geniuses with conviction\n\nKing of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated\n\nKing of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken\n\nKing of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse\n\nKing of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice\n\nKing of the skyscrapers, dodging haters, broke religion\n\nNine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision\n\nI embrace them with collision\n\nKings did it, king vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick\n\nAll hail the king, I dropped a million tears\n\nI know several responsibilities put me here\n\nI don't pedal backwards but I live old-fashioned\n\nAnd the lens that I'm looking through\n\nWon't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free\n\nAshes I'm dumping out, 'bout to spread 'cross all seas\n\nSisters and brother in unison, not because of me\n\nBecause we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace\n\nAnd I'm still gon' fuck up your organization if any beef\n\nWhat do you stand for?\n\nAre you an activist? What are your city plans for?\n\nAre you an accident, are you just in the way?\n\nYour native tongue contradicting what your body language say\n\nAre you a king or you joking, are you a king or you posing?\n\nAre you a king or you smoking bud rocks to keep you open?\n\nBecause the king don't cry, king don't die\n\nKing don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall\n\nKingdom come, when I come, you know why\n\nKing, king, king, king\n\nI am T'Challa!"
