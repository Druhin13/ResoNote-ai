Or is it too much\n\nAm I outta' line? I don't wanna hurt this time\n\nBut it's better to say it, then let it live in my mind\n\n\n\n'Cause everybody needs somebody to hold on to\n\nI'm starting to believe, I could hold on to you\n\nI'm gonna learn how to trust and let go of it all\n\nEnjoy the feeling that I can't control the way I fall\n\n\n\nI got nothing to lose\n\nI got nothing to lose\n\n\n\nIt's only love\n\nIt's only love, only love\n\nIt's only love\n\nIt's only love, only love\n\nIt's only right\n\nThat we find a way to keep it all [?]\n\n'Cause it's only love, only love"
