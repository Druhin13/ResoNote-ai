  "lyrics": "Your heart, your home, your voice, it’s got a price tag\r\nSign in blood, bury your rights in a body bag\r\nThey’re feeding fear through the fault lines\r\nYou heard it here first, they got your freedoms on the front line\r\nPrime time, the noose at our throats\r\nOur liberties hands run with blood of the scapegoats\n\nSo tell me, how can we demonize\n\nWhen we can’t see life through another's eyes\n\n\n\nPay ‘em off and play ‘em off\n\nFear rolls like a reaper through the streets of the lost\n\nPay ‘em off and play ‘em off\n\nBut in the eyes of the storm\n\n\n\nThe truth drops like a bomb\n\nThe truth drops like a bomb\n\nThe battle is on\n\n\n\nHands in chains for a fist full of dollars\n\nWho do we blame for the holes in our knowledge\n\nThe past you know has been written by the victor\n\nSo I ask you now, who is it writing your future\n\nThe butcher, the liar, the thief or the killer\n\nYour freedom died quiet in the halls of power\n\nStarved for peace we’ll eat war until it kills us\n\nSix feet deep with a belly full of bullets\n\n\n\nPay ‘em off and play ‘em off\n\nFear rolls like a reaper through the streets of the lost\n\nPay ‘em off and play ‘em off\n\nBut in the eyes of the storm\n\n\n\nThe truth drops like a bomb\n\nThe truth drops like a bomb\n\nThe battle is on\n\n\n\nThe hate runs deep but our hopes cut deeper\n\nNow we walk through the valley in the shadow of the reaper\n\nMoney talks, and it’s speaking in tongues\n\nThey put a price on our soul, like they had already won\n\nNow open wide\n\nI see their jaws locked tight\n\nSilent in the moment, like prey in the floodlights\n\nThe signal is static, baptised in fire\n\nNow we see how they talk\n\nWith a mouth full of barbed wire\n\n\n\nAbsolute power \n\nAbsolute power\n\nAbsolute power \n\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely\n\nAbsolute power \n\nAbsolute power \n\nAbsolute power\n\nAbsolute power corrupts\n\n\n\nThe truth drops like a bomb\n\nThe truth drops like a bomb\n\nThe battle is on\n\n\n\nThe truth drops like a …\n\n\n\nAbsolute power corrupts absolutely"
