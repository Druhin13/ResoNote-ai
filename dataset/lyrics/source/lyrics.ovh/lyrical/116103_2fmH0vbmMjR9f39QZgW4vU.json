  "lyrics": "Cause I take fear in those who love me\r\nLow lighting with the gated entry\r\nI'm level-headed cause I'm never stressing\r\nAnd I stay unsettled, never wanted blessing\r\nSo I don't wanna be loved\n\nNo, I don't wanna be loved\n\nAnd I don't wanna make up\n\nNo, I don't wanna make up\n\n\n\nShort-sighted for the lies I told you\n\nBut you stood tall when the glass was empty\n\nAnd you're lowkey in the face of limelight\n\nAnd you wanna be who you are when it really counts most\n\n\n\nSo I don't wanna be loved\n\nNo, I don't wanna be loved\n\nAnd I don't wanna make up\n\nNo, I don't wanna make up\n\n\n\nLiving like a true Hollywood story\n\nHighways, chasing washed up glory\n\nRisk it all, no need to be a martyr\n\nParadise couldn't get much harder\n\nEgo is all the baggage that I need\n\nIt's all pressure for the ones that you really love\n\n\n\nSo I don't wanna be in love (love, love)\n\nSo I don't wanna be in love (love, love)\n\nAnd I don't wanna make up\n\nAnd I don't wanna make up"
