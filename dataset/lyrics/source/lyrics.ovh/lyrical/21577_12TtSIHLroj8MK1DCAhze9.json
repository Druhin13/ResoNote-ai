  "lyrics": "I’m sinking with America\r\nAll smothered by my conscience and fear\r\nI’m aching in the strangest places\r\nCan’t feel myself with distance\r\nI forget that there’s a world outside\n\nWhere I can be weightless in the sunlight\n\nSo many vices with me everywhere I go\n\nAnd they’re serving me to the lions slowly\n\n\n\nBaby I feel like I’m alone again\n\nAnd I’m fading, I know that this is how it ends\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you promise that you will carry the pain?\n\nOh baby, ‘cause I feel I’ll never break the chain\n\n\n\nAnd I repeat the foolish addict’s loop\n\nThe boiling over and the keeping it cool\n\nGive me the stage, God knows my life needs staging\n\nWhat the hell else should I do?\n\n\n\nBaby I feel like I’m alone again\n\nAnd I’m fading, I know that this is how it ends\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you promise that you will carry the pain?\n\nOh baby, ‘cause I feel I’ll never break the chain"
