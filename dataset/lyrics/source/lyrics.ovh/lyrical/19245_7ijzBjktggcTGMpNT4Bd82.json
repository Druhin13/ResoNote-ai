J couldn't Close out\r\n(?) and no winning\r\nI'm hella sick of pretending\r\nLike I just don't want to end it\r\nIf I can finish the pain\n\nWithout feeling the shame\n\nI'd take a gun from the range\n\nAnd put that shit to my brain\n\nAnd bang (bang)\n\nI grew up on the Bible\n\nBut I don't wanna lie bro\n\nI'm feeling so suicidal\n\nAll these trials and tribulations\n\nRemember that you're bigger than\n\nThe problems that you're facing\n\nSo you take 10 paces\n\nThen turn around and shoot\n\nAll of your fears in their faces\n\nExecute and assisinate\n\nLow-fi shit unproductive as I procrastinate\n\nYeah, unplugging and still thuggin'\n\nOG delivering truth to all the youngins\n\n\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nI'm too low-fi for your technology\n\nMy mind too wild for your psychology\n\nMy God too big for your biology\n\nSo I'ma keep on living my life with no apology\n\n\n\nNow once upon a time in the land with no reception\n\nI came across a wire then I made my connection\n\nI got in tune with myself\n\nBaptized underneath the full moon for my health\n\nIf wealth is there in spirit\n\nIn poverty of the pocket\n\nAll I ask is that you pay me attention\n\nAnd I'ma rock it\n\nGot it got if I need it, if not than i don't need it\n\nForce yourself to fall in love with your future\n\nAnd then repeat it\n\nThe secret keep it simple\n\nResults will be monumental\n\nMost ultimate of warriors\n\nEntering continental\n\nChampion with champions\n\nPlace me up in the pantheon\n\n\"Only Gods Can Judge Me\"\n\nIn songs is how I answer them\n\nScribbling these phrases on pages\n\nAnd make em dance for them\n\nPlay me for your friends\n\nBut I'm probably too advanced for them\n\nEars to the underground\n\nCall it noise cancelling\n\nPull the plug on the power it's time to channel in\n\n\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nLow-fi night we living low-fi nights\n\nI'm too low-fi for your technology\n\nMy mind too wild for your psychology\n\nMy God too big for your biology\n\nSo I'ma keep on living my life with no apology"
