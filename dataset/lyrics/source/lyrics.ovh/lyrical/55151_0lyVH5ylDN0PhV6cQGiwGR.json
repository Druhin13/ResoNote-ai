  "lyrics": "Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet\r\nComes a snowstorm, you can get a little heat\r\nComes love, nothing can be done.\r\nComes a fire, then you know just what to do\r\nBlow a tire, you can buy another shoe\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\n\n\nDon't try hiding, cause there isn't any use\n\nYou'll start sliding, when your heart turns on the juice\n\n\n\nComes a headache, you can lose it in a day\n\nComes a toothache, see your dentist right away\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\n\n\nComes a heatwave, you can hurry to the shore\n\nComes a summons, you can hide behind the door\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\n\n\nComes the measles, you can quarantine a room\n\nComes a mousey, you can chase it with a broom\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\n\n\nThat's all, brother, if you ever been in love\n\nThat's all, brother, you know what I'm speaking of\n\n\n\nComes a nightmare, you can always stay awake\n\nComes depression, you may get another break\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\nComes love, nothing can be done\n\n\n\nComes love,\n\nComes love,\n\nComes love,\n\nComes love,\n\n(fade)"
