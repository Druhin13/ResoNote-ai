Telling lies?\n\nTryna hide these feelings through alibis?\n\nI know you want this and I want it too\n\nSo tell me what we gonna do\n\n\n\nAnd everyday when I awake\n\nI think of the love we could make\n\nBaby, I just can't enough\n\nTalking about this thing with us\n\nI wanna be more than your friend\n\nYou know what I want, don't pretend\n\nAnd you know I'm gonna be here till the end\n\n\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, could be love\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, baby\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, could be love\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, baby\n\n\n\nAnd you know I'm gonna be here, be here\n\n(Hey)\n\nAnd you know I'm gonna be here till the end\n\n\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, could be love\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, baby\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, could be love\n\nI got a feeling that this could be love, baby"
