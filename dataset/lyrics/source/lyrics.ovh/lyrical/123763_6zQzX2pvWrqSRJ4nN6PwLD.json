  "lyrics": "Mama says I walk like him, feet at 10 and 2\r\nMy uncle says I talk like him, I get my point across the room\r\nAnd if he were here today, he'd just laugh out loud when they say\r\n'Cause he knew that his boy was just like him\r\nSo I cuss a little bit when the game's on TV\n\nGot Eagles in the truck on TV\n\nKnow how to use a hammer and nail\n\nDon't whine about my problems\n\nHe was better at putting that bottle down\n\nBut I spend every day tryna make him proud\n\nIf I said that I didn't, I'd be lying\n\nBut I'm trying to walk like him\n\n\n\nPapa said I'm stubborn like him, and I guess that he would know\n\nMy daddy got it from him, and I make 3 in a row\n\nLate night, how it goes, a bloodline keeping him alive\n\nOne day, my babies'll look at me and see what he was like\n\n\n\nSo I cuss a little bit when the game's on TV\n\nGot Eagles in the truck on TV\n\nKnow how to use a hammer and nail\n\nDon't whine about my problems\n\nHe was better at putting that bottle down\n\nBut I spend every day tryna make him proud\n\nIf I said that I didn't, I'd be lying\n\nBut I'm trying to walk like him\n\nOh, walk like him\n\n\n\nI remember when he sat me down and told me he was sick\n\nSaid, \"Son, don't worry 'bout me, you've got your life to live\"\n\nHe started talking to God again\n\nIt'd been a while, like old friends\n\nAnd when the time came for him, I know where he went\n\n\n\nSo I pray a little more a day than I used to\n\nCall Mama every day like he said\n\nKnow how to treat a woman right and live a life\n\nHe was better at putting that bottle down\n\nBut I spend every day tryna make him proud\n\nIf I said that I didn't, I'd be lying\n\nBut I'll keep trying to walk like him\n\nOh, walk like him, yeah\n\n\n\nMama says I walk like him, feet at 10 and 2"
