  "lyrics": "Face down; this is where it leads you - too far\r\nBuried covered now, you'll find peace - in the earth aground\r\nStop now, there's no point in breathing - it's not allowed\r\nOn the surface, how can you find - reason to move on?\r\nUntil then you can runaway\n\nDo your best to hide your face\n\nAnd oh I know you best;\n\nI know you get what you get\n\nYou get what you deserve\n\n\n\nHush now, don't say a word - it's out in the open\n\nAnd tell me how can you deal with all this weight\n\nSpeak now, you must have a secret kept down\n\nDown where you can keep it - I need you to spill your guts\n\n\n\nUntil then you can runaway\n\nDo your best to hide your face\n\nAnd oh I know you best\n\nI know you get what you get\n\nUntil then you can runaway\n\nDo your best to hide your face\n\nAnd oh I know you best\n\nI know you get what you get\n\nYou get what you deserve\n\n\n\nSpeak now you must have a secret kept down\n\nDown where you can keep it - I need you to spill your guts\n\n\n\nUntil then you can runaway\n\nDo your best to hide your face\n\nAnd oh I know you best\n\nI know you get what you get\n\nUntil then you can runaway\n\nDo your best to hide your face\n\nAnd oh I know you best\n\nI know you get what you get\n\nAnd all you get what you\n\nYou get what you get\n\nYou get what you\n\nYou get what you get\n\nAnd all you get what you deserve"
