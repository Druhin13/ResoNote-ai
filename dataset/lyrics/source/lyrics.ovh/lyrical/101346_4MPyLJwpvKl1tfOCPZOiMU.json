  "lyrics": "Every time I'm awake I can see your dress hanging on the back of the door\r\nI feel like it's staring me down, so I look to the floor\r\nEvery time I move, tripping on your shoes, every time I open a drawer\r\nI let the skeletons out and we dance with the hore\r\nI got all this love, nothing to do with it now\n\nWhen you gonna come and get it? I can't throw it out\n\nI got all this love gathering dust in my house\n\nI got all this love, all this love\n\n\n\nWater's getting rough, swimming in your stuff, I just wanna get to the shore\n\nI drowning in memories of you that I try to ignore\n\nStill, I'm playing host, hanging with the ghosts, telling them the story of you\n\nThey always laugh at my jokes as we dance through the roof\n\n\n\nI got all this love, nothing to do with it now\n\nWhen you gonna come and get it? I can't throw it out\n\nI got all this love gathering dust in my house\n\nI got all this love, all this love\n\n\n\nBaby, when you gonna come? (Gonna come)\n\nGonna come now\n\nAre you ever gonna come? (Gonna come)\n\nGonna come now\n\nAre you ever gonna come? (Gonna come)\n\nGonna come now\n\n\n\nI got all this love, nothing to do with it now\n\nWhen you gonna come and get it? I can't throw it out\n\nI got all this love gathering dust in my house\n\nI got all this love, all this love\n\n\n\n....\n\nI got all this love, no one to give it to, no"
