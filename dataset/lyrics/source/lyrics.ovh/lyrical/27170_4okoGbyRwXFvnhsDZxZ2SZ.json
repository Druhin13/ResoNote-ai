  "lyrics": "Another night up at the bar late\r\nSkinny dresses and heartbreaks\r\nThere's nothing magic going on\r\nThen 'long came you\r\nAll the lights are down low\r\nAnd I keep losing my focus\n\nThere's something happening\n\nI can't keep cool\n\nOh, I can't sleep\n\nI'm dancing with adrenaline\n\nI can't speak\n\nHands, they keep trembling\n\nI've been so weak\n\nWhen you make an entrance\n\nAnd when you leave\n\nOh, I can't hardly breathe\n\nOh, darling, I can't breathe\n\nOh, I can't hardly breathe\n\nOh, darling, I can't breathe\n\nCan't hardly breathe\n\nOh, I can't breathe\n\nCan't hardly breathe\n\nOh I, oh I\n\nCan't hardly\n\nAnd now you're killing me softly\n\nYou're saying things with your body\n\nSo I take your hand and then we go\n\nAll eyes on you\n\nAnd I pull you in closer\n\nYou got me hooked and you know it\n\nYou're like a gamble\n\nBut I love playing it loose\n\nCan't sleep\n\nI'm dancing with adrenaline\n\nI can't speak\n\nHands, they keep trembling\n\nI've been so weak\n\nWhen you make an entrance\n\nAnd when you leave\n\nOh, I can't hardly breathe\n\nOh, darling, I can't breathe\n\nOh, I can't hardly breathe\n\nOh I, oh I\n\nCan't hardly breathe\n\nOh, I can't breathe\n\nCan't hardly breathe\n\nI can't hardly\n\nOh, tell me what you've done; I'm awoken\n\nAnd I love it more every moment\n\nSo, give me something for when you leave\n\n'Cause I can't hardly breathe\n\nI can't hardly breathe\n\nI can't hardly breathe\n\n(I can't breathe)"
