Shamu fan, got a world to see!\n\n\n\nHaile Selassie\n\nHigh as the eye of an osprey\n\nI'm driving\n\nPoseidon you tried to stop me, from diving\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nAs I float\n\nBrand new shell for my goals\n\nTattoos all on my coast\n\n\n\nThen until the philosophy which holds one race superior\n\nAnd another inferior\n\nIs finally and permanently discredited and abandoned\n\nThat until there no longer\n\nFirst class and second class citizens of any nation\n\nThat until the color of the man's skin\n\nIs no more significant than the color of his eyes\n\nSelassie\n\n\n\nTo the limit\n\nThe limit in the Methadone clinic\n\nRidin' with the pack like a Pelitan\n\nFlyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant\n\nAs it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon\n\nIf I triple my worth, will it cripple my mom?\n\nIf I simple my search, will it mental my calm?\n\nWill it hurt if I give you my palm?\n\nTo tell in it and don't put a nail in it\n\nHow you gonna see the world if you wailin'\n\nAnd readin' my palms like there's braille in it\n\nIs it the trail or the forest?\n\nOr the forest with the trail in it?\n\nThat's a sail with a 12 in it\n\nWater coming through from impalin' it\n\nNothin' left of the boat but my holes\n\nStill I fill up the world and I float, like\n\n\n\nHaile Selassie\n\nHigh as the eye of an osprey\n\nI'm driving\n\nPoseidon you tried to stop me, from diving\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nAs I float\n\nBrand new shell for my goals\n\nTattoos all on my coast\n\n\n\nA qualified man with vision\n\nUnmoved by daily selfish interests\n\nLed to right decisions by his conscience\n\nIn general, a man who knows from whence he comes\n\nAnd where he's going\n\nWill cooperate with his fellow human beings\n\nHe will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties\n\nBut will inspire others by his good example\n\nYou are being watched by the nation\n\nAnd you should realize\n\nThat you, will satisfy it if you do good\n\nBut on the contrary, you do evil, it will lose it's hope and confidence in you\n\nSelassie\n\n\n\nH-h-h-hydrant open wide\n\nOn the side of the colonized\n\nSwimmin' in the street, fell asleep on my mama thighs\n\nBlockin' out the noise that destroys lil' boys\n\nLive enjoy, ships ahoy, get deployed by the rock-a-byes\n\nD-d-d-deep into the sea of my dreams\n\nLyin' fall asleep at the feet of my queen\n\nHawk comin' right to the beat of your wings\n\nSong for the Ethiopian King\n\nHaile\n\n\n\nHaile Selassie\n\nHigh as the eye of an osprey\n\nI'm driving\n\nPoseidon you tried to stop me, from diving\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nAs I float\n\nBrand new shell for my goals\n\nTattoos all on my coast\n\n\n\nHaile Selassie\n\nHigh as the eye of an osprey\n\nI'm driving\n\nPoseidon you tried to stop me, from diving\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nLookin' for my\n\nAs I float\n\nBrand new shell for my goals\n\nTattoos all on my coast"
