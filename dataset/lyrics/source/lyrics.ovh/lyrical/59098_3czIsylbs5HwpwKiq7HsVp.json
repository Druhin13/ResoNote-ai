  "lyrics": "On the road, there's no turning back\r\nI watch the daylight fade to black\r\nI've got the feeling I'm not coming back\r\nGreeted by the devil in disguise\r\nI'm petrified when I look in your eyes\r\nI wonder if I would ever survive\n\nI hope you make it out alive\n\n\n\nDrink up, cut loose\n\nAnother shot, blowing my brains out\n\nOn a high, blow the fuse\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight\n\n\n\nOver time, I'm slowly going blind\n\nAnother drink to help me lose my mind\n\nThe exit sign is getting harder to find\n\nOut of the shadows the hunter comes\n\nUnder the moonlight, safe from the sun\n\nWhat kind of monster am I running from\n\nYou better pray you get away\n\n\n\nDrink up, cut loose\n\nAnother shot, blowing my brains out\n\nOn a high, blow the fuse\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight\n\nDrink up, cut loose\n\nAnother shot, blowing my brains out\n\nOn a high, blow the fuse\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight\n\n\n\nOn this road there's no turning back\n\nI watched the daylight fade to black\n\nAnd now I know that I'm not coming back\n\nHosted by Satan in disguise\n\nThere's no escaping, there's no alibis\n\nNowhere to run and there's no where to hide\n\nI'll make it out alive\n\n\n\nDrink up, cut loose\n\nAnother shot, blowing my brains out\n\nOn a high, blow the fuse\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight\n\nDrink up, cut loose\n\nAnother shot, blowing my brains out\n\nOn a high, blow the fuse\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight\n\nThe freak show starts after midnight"
