  "lyrics": "What if we had done it all for money\r\nAnd nobody ever even really cared\r\nWho can you pay to come and clear it all away\r\nTo start fresh and earn it all again\r\nMaybe it's something like Elvis on a big screen\r\nAnd someone lied in your dreams\n\n\n\nIf you're gonna put the hard times on poor choices\n\nYou gotta put the good ones on luck\n\nYou better save something for to get you smarter\n\nFor when you're dumb, done and all out of work\n\nHope it's not like Darwin and his silly ideas\n\nThey're only right if they believe\n\n\n\nHow could the top feel so empty\n\nGet to the point, nothing left but to fall\n\nThey used to love this, why don't they like it\n\nWhen I'm, just trying to grow\n\nCould be like sending people into outer space\n\nWith no real finish to the race, the race\n\n\n\nMaking money out of nonsense (nonsense...)\n\n\n\nAnd living large off the useless (useless...)\n\n\n\nNow I am surrounded (surrounded...)\n\n\n\nFeeling like a captive (captive)\n\n\n\nSpent too much time looking for the right song to sing\n\nIt matters more the love it brings\n\nBut if you need a voice, I'm yours, friend\n\nFor something better in the end\n\n\n\nWhat if we had done it all for money\n\nAnd nobody ever even really cared\n\nWho can you pay to come and clear it all away\n\nTo start fresh and earn it all again\n\nProbably life's like Dorothy in a weird dream\n\nAnd nothing's as hard as it may seem"
