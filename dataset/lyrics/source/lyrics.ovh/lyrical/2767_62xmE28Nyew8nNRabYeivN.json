  "lyrics": "Blood red summer, Neon nights\r\nDiamond gypsy in shadow light\r\nFeeling hungry, need a thrill\r\nEyes to cut me legs to kill\r\nAnd I'm down for the weekend\n\nGot a buck and a love for the deep end\n\nYou got a story, a secret for keeping\n\nAnd I want it, yes I want it, I want it\n\n\n\nA wolf when the moons out\n\nI found God in a dive with the lights down\n\nYou said you're dying to get outta this town\n\nYeah you want it, you want it\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do\n\nDying to get to you\n\nLiving in a mad world, no lie\n\nShe told me bad girls don't cry\n\n\n\nLooking for something true\n\nPutting my hand on you\n\nTell me are you sad girl, oh why\n\nShe told me bad girls don't cry\n\n\n\nMidnight dancer, take my hand\n\nMaybe I'm your kinda man, she said\n\nEveryday it's Halloween\n\nLittle boys and lipstick dreams\n\n\n\nAnd I'm sprung like a first date\n\nWith the cash in my hand got me checkmate\n\nYou keep your heart in a vault with a brass case\n\nBut I want it, yes I want, I want it\n\n\n\nYou move when the song plays\n\nSay you live in a world full of dog days\n\nAnd you dream of a life out of this cage\n\nAnd you're on it, you're on it\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do\n\nDying to get to you\n\nLiving in a mad world, no lie\n\nShe told me bad girls don't cry\n\n\n\nLooking for something true\n\nPutting my hand on you\n\nWon't you tell me are you sad girl, oh why\n\nShe told me bad girls don't cry\n\n\n\nShe told me bad girls don't cry"
