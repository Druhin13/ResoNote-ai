  "lyrics": "The time to waste together\r\nLet's not say it's lost\r\nIt's just traded in\r\nAnd we might get it back again\r\nNot now, not yet\r\nBut sooner that it feels\n\nNot down, not out, not less\n\nAnd then in a blink it will change\n\nKiss the kids goodnight and then\n\nHold your breath, count to ten\n\nGlance over your shoulder, it's changed\n\nThough you haven't chosen how\n\nWe'll take what comes around\n\n\n\nIt's quarter past eleven\n\nLet's not say it's night time\n\nIf we're just waking up\n\n'Cause when the clocks change\n\nYou're gonna have to wait\n\nNot now, not yet\n\nBut soon, soon, soon\n\nNot down, not out, not less\n\nAnd then in a blink it will change\n\nKiss the kids goodnight and then\n\nCheck their breath, count to ten\n\nGlance over your shoulder, they've changed\n\nThough you haven't chosen how\n\nWe'll take what comes around"
