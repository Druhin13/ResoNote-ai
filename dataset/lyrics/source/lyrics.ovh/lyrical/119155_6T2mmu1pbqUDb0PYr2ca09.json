  "lyrics": "Is time written in a stone every life was lived long ago\r\nOr does it change with every single step\r\nEvery single word, every single breath?\r\nI've been trying make sence of it all, of it all\r\n'Cause if we met in another way, on another day\n\nWould it all turn out the same?\n\nWould it all turn out the same?\n\n\n\nIs tomorrow out of my control? Am I the film in this episode?\n\nOr is fait just a fantasy, a fairy tale, all make believe?\n\nDo you wonder why?\n\n'Cause I wonder why is it borrowed time, is it borrowed time\n\n\n\n'Cause if we met in another way, on another day\n\nWould it all turn out the same?\n\nWould it all turn out the same?\n\nWould it all turn out the same?\n\nWould it all turn out the same?"
