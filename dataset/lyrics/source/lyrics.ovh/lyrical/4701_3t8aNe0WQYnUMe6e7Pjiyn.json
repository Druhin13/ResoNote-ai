  "lyrics": "In black and white, no whisper of colour\r\nIn monochrome, we met each other\r\nI'll put my faith in my pain\r\nIn you to keep safe\r\nThe Autumn wind is so unforgiving\n\nMuch like the scars that trace my body\n\nYour icy touch I trust\n\nI feel it beckoning me\n\n\n\nI was melting away and breaking\n\nBut then you tenderly saved me from myself\n\nFate is the game we're playing\n\nAnd it starts with a monochrome kiss\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I'm searching on\n\nLooking for a single drop of love\n\nI look into your eyes; eyes that have never once cried\n\nThey tell a tale beyond time\n\n\n\nAnd if I can, I'll seek the end\n\nShrouded in my pain just as I am\n\nHiding within the night, together we'll find it\n\nUnder the light of the moon\n\n\n\nHow many nights have I loved in your wake?\n\nI've come to know, to see your heartache\n\nI need you here with me\n\nWithout you, I forget to breathe\n\n\n\nWith your gaze I am captivated\n\nBut I am finding it holds no warmth at all\n\nNow all the rules are changing\n\nBut I despise how you lie with a kiss\n\n\n\nI'm begging please, don't leave me alone\n\nColour in my heart, right to my soul\n\nLulling me to sleep, lies I have always believed\n\nSo tell a tale in my dreams\n\n\n\nI'm so confused, I've lost my mind\n\nWhisper soft as I'm closing my eyes\n\nFinding all that was lost, your smile the cost was\n\nUnder the light of the moon\n\n\n\nI was melting away and breaking\n\nBut then you tenderly saved me from myself\n\nFate is the game we're playing\n\nAnd it all starts with a monochrome kiss\n\n\n\nNevertheless, I'm searching on\n\nLooking for a single drop of love\n\nI look into your eyes; eyes that have never once cried\n\nThey tell a tale beyond time\n\n\n\nAnd if I can, I'll seek the end\n\nShrouding in my pain just as I am\n\nYour wish in the dark, shining in bay like the dawn\n\nA barely new tomorrow\n\n\n\nSo pay it again\n\nSo passionate; A braveless kiss on my lips\n\nHiding within the night together we'll find it\n\nMy final night under the moon"
