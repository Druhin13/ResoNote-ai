  "lyrics": "One life fades\r\nLet another shine in its place\r\nIt's just the moving of colors\r\nMy hands don't play the same\r\nBut they'll try anyway\r\nEach accusing the other\n\n\n\nYou can do what you want\n\nBut I'm making my own way\n\nEither you will or you won't\n\nYou're longing on\n\nIf you can yourself in\n\n\n\nIf daylight breaks\n\nAnd you're still miles away\n\nYou should move into cover\n\nI'll try escape\n\nIn a more permanent way\n\nCan we keep to each other\n\nWhere you've been all this time\n\n\n\nWould you give one more day\n\nIf you're able I've wondered\n\nBefore they clear one more place\n\nAt the table I've wondered\n\nA penny for your thoughts\n\nSo many for the fall\n\nBefore they meet each other\n\n\n\nIf daylight breaks\n\nAnd you're still miles away\n\nYou should move into cover\n\nI'll try escape\n\nIn a more permanent way\n\nCan we keep to each other\n\n\n\nYou can do what you want\n\nBut I'm makin' my own way"
