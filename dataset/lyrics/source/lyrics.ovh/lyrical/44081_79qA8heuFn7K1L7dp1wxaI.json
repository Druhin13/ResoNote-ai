  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson I Know Your Secrets par Tommee Profitt\r\nCaught in the middle of your web\nNow your hands are red\nEvery word you said feels hollow\nAll of the promises you've made\nAre dead and washed away\nYour smoke and mirrors won't change what I know\n\nI know your secrets\nI know your lies\nI see the darkness\nLiving inside\nThere's nowhere to run to\nNowhere to hide\nCause I know your secrets\nI know your lies\n\n\nLost in the monster you've become\nNow you're on the run\nLiving life behind the shadows\nCrossed with a target on your head\nNow you've made your bed\nNothing left to say now\n\nI know your secrets\nI know your lies\nI see the darkness\nLiving inside\nThere's nowhere to run to\nNowhere to hide\nCause I know your secrets\nYeah I know your secrets\nI know your secrets\nI know your lies\n\n\n(Nowhere to run to)\n(Nowhere to hide)\n(I know your secrets)\n(I know your lies)"
