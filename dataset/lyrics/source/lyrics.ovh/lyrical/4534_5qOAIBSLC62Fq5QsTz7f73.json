  "lyrics": "We talk, talk 'til we're blue in the face\r\nThe words, the words don't resonate\r\nSeasons, they always seem to stay the same\r\nI'm holding on to things we said we would change\r\nI'm stuck, babe\n\nStuck with nowhere to go\n\nIt cuts, babe, 'cause we're just taking it slow\n\nIt's overdue, make your move\n\nStuck, babe\n\nStuck with nowhere to go\n\n\n\nYou move, and I don't really know what to say\n\nToo soon, am I supposed to feel this way?\n\nReach out but I don't wanna get in your way\n\nToo little, too late, I know that's what you're gonna say\n\n\n\nI'm stuck, babe\n\nStuck with nowhere to go\n\nIt cuts, babe, 'cause we're just taking it slow\n\nIt's overdue, make your move\n\nStuck, babe\n\nStuck with nowhere to go\n\n\n\nI see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes\n\nWe ain't satisfied\n\nWaste away our lives, our lives, our lives\n\nWe ain't satisfied\n\n\n\nWe talk, talk 'til blue in the face\n\nHolding on to the things we said we would change\n\n\n\nYou know I'm stuck, baby\n\nStuck with nowhere to go\n\n(You know I'm stuck here)\n\nIt cuts, babe, 'cause we're just taking it slow\n\n(Taking it slow)\n\n\n\nI see it in your eyes, your eyes, your eyes\n\nWe ain't satisfied\n\nStuck, baby\n\nStuck with nowhere to go"
