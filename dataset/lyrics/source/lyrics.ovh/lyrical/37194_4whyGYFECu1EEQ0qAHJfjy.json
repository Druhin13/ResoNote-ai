  "lyrics": "It must be something that we call love\r\nWherever I go I'm coming back\r\nAnd time cannot knock me off my track\r\nThis resolution is final\r\nIt must be something that we call love\n\nIt's when you're craving to say her name\n\nAnd my reality seems to break apart\n\nWith her arrival\n\n\n\nNo need to worry, rain falling down\n\nIt's our happiest story and there's no one around\n\nWe will go for it and I know you'll be mine forever\n\nWindows wide open, flying so high\n\nBoth of us roaming through magnificent sky\n\nRain keeps on falling and I know you'll be mine forever\n\n\n\nIt must be something that we call dream\n\nWhen all you told me I know by heart\n\nThe type of beauty I call supreme\n\nAnd how it's driving me crazy\n\n\n\nNo need to worry, rain falling down\n\nIt's our happiest story and there's no one around\n\nWe will go for it and I know you'll be mine forever\n\nWindows wide open, flying so high\n\nBoth of us roaming through magnificent sky\n\nRain keeps on falling and I know you'll be mine forever\n\n\n\nYou'll always sing me something new\n\nI will always follow\n\nWhen I first saw you here I knew\n\nThat I was blind before you\n\n\n\nNo need to worry, rain falling down\n\nIt's our happiest story and there's no one around\n\nWe will go for it and I know you'll be mine forever\n\nWindows wide open, flying so high\n\nBoth of us roaming through magnificent sky\n\nRain keeps on falling and I know you'll be mine forever"
