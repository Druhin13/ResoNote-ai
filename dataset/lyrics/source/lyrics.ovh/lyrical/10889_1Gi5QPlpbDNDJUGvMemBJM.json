Horses neighing.]\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\rYou better count your money.\rwith Felicia:\rGhetto cowboy.\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\rThe name is Krayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone, wanted up north for all the\rgold that I stole, along with some cash, even took the\rmayor's daughter. Now, that there's kidnappin', but she was with it,\rso I brought her. Then, got myself into a whole heap of\rtrouble, double-crossed by the law, so there's nobody to run to: yeah,\rit's just me and my sawed-off shotgun. Outlaw--call him\rLeather Face. I'm headed for the West, heard they got a couple banks\rin town that ain't been held up yet. Well, uh, I oughta\rmake it by sundown. I figure that's enough time for me to get the\rwhole rundown. So, I continue my mission. It's gettin' dark,\rso I'm watchin' for them damn Injuns--they like to catch ya, then they\rrob and split. I be a rootin'-tootin'-shootin' damn fool,\rprotectin' my chips. All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the\rbushes. Stop my horse. [Horse neigh.] \"Whoa,\rNellie! Who in the bushes? You better speak out or I'm a let my\rshotgun song sing out.\"\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\rWho is this? I hope this ain't the law. Jump out the bushes with my\rsawed-off shotgun.\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"C'mon out, right now. I'm gettin' angry.\" Took a step back, 'cause it\rcould get dangerous.\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\r\"Please don't shoot. It's just me, Thug Queen, the horse-stealer.\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"Then, why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes?\"\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\r\"I'm wanted in four counties for armed robbery, killed to two\rsheriffs, six of his best men with my hand, stole two horses.\rThought you was the law, that's why I jumped in the bushes.\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"Goodness.\" Now, she was hotter than the barrel on fire, but I could\ruse her for the job, so I told her to ride. \"C'mon.\"\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\r\"May I ask you what you headed to the West for?\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"I got a partner, got a plan for some dough, and if you're down, you\rcan pick up yourself a pretty penny. 'Be in town in a\rminute, now be sure if you're with it.\"\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\r\"We out before the sun rise, gotta stallion for your partner to ride.\"\rHit the saloon for the moonshine. Down for whatever, let's\rride, let's ride.\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona. When we arrive, we'll\rcop a place we can bunk, and meet my boy in the\rmornin' for details and hook-up.\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\rYou better count your money.\rFelicia:\rGhetto cowboy.\r[Rooster crowing.]\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"Rise and shine! Good mornin'. Howdy. Nine o'clock we meet my boy in\rthe saloon in the valley. Now, I done came a long\rway, and I don't wanna be late.\"\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\r\"Tell him I make ya (?) 'cause you know we ain't.\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"Move out! Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup.\" [Whip cracks, horses neigh.]\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\rYou better count your money.\rFelicia:\rGhetto cowboy.\rLayzie \"the Kid\":\rI'm peepin' Krayzie's wanted poster in the saloon, so I assume it'll\rbe trouble around here pretty soon. Glance across the\rroom: I see this youngster getting ready to fight, but if he mess up\rthe night, I think that Krayzie just might take his life. So, I\rapproach him, and I pause. \"Look, man, I really don't wanna brawl, but\rwon't you chill before them laws come messin' up this\rmasterplan?\" Since he already rowdy, I just asked the man: \"Hey, you\rwant some work? Well, partner, put in your bid, and\rby the way, now what's your name? They call me Layzie the Kid.\"\rPowder P:\r\"The name's Powder P, can I get a twelve gauge? Outlaw--everyday on\rthe front page. Mister Kid, if you give me the\rlowdown, me and Black Jack be ready for the showdown with two\rdouble-barrels pointed at whatever. We'll stick together.\rI'm purty clever.\"\rLayzie \"the Kid\":\r\"So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon, because it's all goin' down.\" I\rheard a guy run in the bar screamin', \"Krayzie's in\rtown!\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"Now when we get to the saloon, you don't worry. Wait outside, and\rdon't be stealin' nobody's damn horses!\" Step inside the\rbar. \"Lay the Kid, you son of a gun!\"\rLayzie \"the Kid\":\r\"Hey, man, I'm glad you made it safely. Now let's go have some fun.\rAnd this my partner Powder, he's a young gun.\"\rPowder P:\r\"Howdy.\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"Mighty glad to meet ya, son. Oh yeah, you know I also brought a\rfriend along. Meet Thug Queen, the horse peddler,\rstraggler, just met her.\"\rThug Queen, \"the horse stealer\":\r\"Howdy, partner, already got the horses saddled up.\"\rLayzie \"the Kid\":\r\"I hope you good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up.\"\rPowder P:\r\"Now, y'all, it's gon' be gettin' dark real soon.\"\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\r\"I think you're right, I say we move. C'mon, let's move out!\rGiddyup, giddyup, giddyup. Move out!\" [Whip cracks, horses neigh.]\rKrayzie \"Big Bad Ass\" Bone:\rYou better count your money.\rFelicia:\rGhetto cowboy."
