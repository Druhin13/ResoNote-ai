  "lyrics": "I came to see you in starlight\r\nHeaven receives and so did you\r\nDimming the blue sky\r\nSo much release in a rendezvous\r\nBut I didn’t really step in\r\nWe tasted the cream I went back to Manhattan\n\nIt was one time and\n\nYou’re a scent on the breeze ever since\n\n\n\nAlways to leave my head to spin\n\nRush\n\nForward to leave my head to spin\n\nRush\n\nStay in touch\n\n\n\nWhen we first met you were love tied\n\nFaith like a tree and laying roots\n\nHe could see you as his wife then\n\nHonestly I could see it too\n\nThen he became my close friend\n\nWe spoke of his love for you often\n\nI came to see you in starlight\n\nAnd let electric fields yield to skin\n\n\n\nLeave my head to spin\n\nRush\n\nForward to leave my bed in sin\n\nRush\n\nStay in touch\n\n\n\nThat's how you lose\n\nThat's how you lose\n\nI came to see you in starlight\n\nOver the trees amen\n\nThat’s how you make a ghost\n\nWatch how you break things you learn the most\n\nSomething about the one that negates hope\n\nMarauder chained of no real code\n\nMarauder breaks bonds\n\nMarauder stays long\n\nPlays with the real face on\n\nSee I touched an angel’s wing\n\nShe laid it over me\n\nApproach a remedy\n\nPlayed with the real face on\n\nSee I touched an angel’s wing\n\nShe held it over me\n\nWe had the real face on\n\nSomething about a reckoning"
