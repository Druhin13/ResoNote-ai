  "lyrics": "(Written by Danny Seraphine & David 'Hawk' Wolinski)\r\nI'll never forget those aimless years\r\nStreet sounds swirling through my mind\r\nTrouble was often in the air\r\nSo we fought to forget our despair\n\nI'm a street player\n\nAnd I'll play you a song\n\n'Cause you know, my heart & soul\n\nWill carry, carry on\n\nCarry on\n\nCarry on\n\nCarry on\n\nCity life's the only way\n\nStreet corners and billiard halls was our home away\n\nLessons learned still help me today\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI've seen it all\n\nHit men, thieves and many a brawl\n\nBut as you see I still stand tall\n\nIt was such a small space in time\n\nI never knew that I would find\n\nA musical path for all to see\n\nAnxiety into ecstasy\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI've seen it all\n\nHit men, thieves and many a brawl\n\nBut as you see I still stand tall\n\nIt was such a small space in time\n\nI never knew that I would find\n\nA musical path for all to see\n\nAnxiety into ecstasy\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player\n\nI'm a street player"
