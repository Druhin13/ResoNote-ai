  "lyrics": "I've been awake for a long time\r\nBut now I can see\r\nThe blind leads the blind\r\nThey forget how to feel\r\nIt seems like everyone is trying so hard\n\nTo find sparks, ignite a flame\n\nIt seems like everyone is finding purpose\n\nIn a never ending game\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like I'm alive\n\nLike the waves are crushing in on me\n\nAnd I know what I have found\n\nIt is the key to my awakening\n\n\n\nI've been asleep for a long time\n\nBut never had dreams\n\nMy life had no meaning\n\nI followed the streams\n\n\n\nIt seems like everyone is trying so hard\n\nTo find sparks, ignite a flame\n\nIt seems like everyone is finding purpose\n\nIn a never ending game\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like I'm alive\n\nLike the waves are crushing in on me\n\nAnd I know what I have found\n\nIt is the key to my awakening\n\n\n\nFeels like I'm a-feels like I'm alive\n\nKey to my awakening\n\nFeels like I'm a-feels like I'm alive\n\nKey to my awakening\n\n\n\nI've been hiding everything deep inside\n\nNow I'm coming clean\n\nI've been going up and down like a tide\n\nNow I'm free within\n\nOh\n\nEvery now and then I face my fears\n\nAnd I will go under\n\nStarting new is easier in tears\n\nAnd it feels like I'm alive\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like I'm alive\n\nLike the waves are crushing in on me\n\nAnd I know what I have found\n\nIt is the key to my awakening\n\n\n\nFeels like I'm a-feels like I'm alive\n\nKey to my awakening\n\nFeels like I'm a-feels like I'm alive\n\nKey to my awakening"
