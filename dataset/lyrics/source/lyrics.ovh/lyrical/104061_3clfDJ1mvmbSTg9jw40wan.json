Well, I'm\r\nSorry if I'm overstepping boundaries\r\nI don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel\n\n\n\nIf he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough\n\nI'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)\n\nIf he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right\n\nI'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)\n\n'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find\n\nThat the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now\n\nNo rush, but if he ever singles you up\n\n\n\nHe hasn't even looked your way since you walked in\n\nBut I can't help it that I can't take my eyes off of you\n\nYour favorite song just came on and me and you were singing along\n\nAnd he don't even know a single word\n\n\n\nIf he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough\n\nI'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)\n\nIf he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right\n\nI'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)\n\n'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find\n\nThat the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now\n\nNo rush, but if he ever singles you up\n\nIf he ever singles you up\n\nI'ma be the first to call baby\n\n\n\nSorry if I'm overstepping boundaries\n\nI don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel\n\n\n\nIf he ever singles you up, if he's ever stupid enough\n\nI'ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)\n\nIf he ain't holding you tight, if he ain't treating you right\n\nI'ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)\n\n'Cause girl, it's just a matter of time until you find\n\nThat the right guy's staring you back into your eyes, right now\n\nNo rush, but if he ever singles you up\n\nOh, if he ever singles you up\n\nIf he ever singles you up"
