  "lyrics": "You know it's hard to be the person that's waiting\r\nI can't keep up, so I'll wait for you\r\nAnd the way you act out, I can't explain it\r\nHaven't slept for days and I'm blaming you\r\nAnd I don't mind the fighting or the secrets that you're hiding\n\nI just can't go on denying no more\n\nAnd do you know, do you know, do you know\n\nThat you're too far out to love? Too far out, girl\n\n\n\nLook what you do to me, oh\n\nI'm tired of eyes wide shut\n\nThis crazy love, I can't fix it\n\nI'm not wild enough for you\n\nLook what you do to me, oh\n\nI tired of eyes wide shut\n\nThis crazy love, I can't fix it\n\nQuit crazy love, I can't fix it, no\n\n\n\nYou're too far out\n\nToo far out to love\n\n\n\nAnd there were times when I thought you were changing\n\nEven though I tried, I can't change for you, I can't change for you\n\nSo I guess this love is through\n\nIt's not steady enough for me or ready enough for you\n\n\n\n'Cause I don't mind the fighting or the secrets that you're hiding\n\nI just can't go on denying no more\n\nAnd do you know, do you know, do you know\n\nThat you're too far out to love? Too far out, girl\n\n\n\nLook what you do to me, oh\n\nI'm tired of eyes wide shut\n\nThis crazy love, I can't fix it\n\nI'm not wild enough for you\n\nLook what you do to me, oh\n\nI tired of eyes wide shut\n\nThis crazy love, I can't fix it\n\nQuit crazy love, I can't fix it, no\n\n\n\nYou're too far out\n\n\n\nYou know it's hard to be the person that's waiting\n\nI can't keep up, so I'll wait for you (oh, baby)\n\n\n\nLook what you do to me, oh\n\nI'm tired of eyes wide shut\n\nThis crazy love, I can't fix it\n\nI'm not wild enough for you\n\nLook what you do to me, oh\n\nI tired of eyes wide shut\n\nThis crazy love, I can't fix it\n\nQuit crazy love, I can't fix it, no\n\n\n\nYou're too far out, no more\n\nYou're too far out\n\nToo far out to love\n\nYou're too far out\n\nToo far out to love"
