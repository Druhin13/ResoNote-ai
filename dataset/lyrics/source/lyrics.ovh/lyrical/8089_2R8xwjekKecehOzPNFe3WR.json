  "lyrics": "When my plans unravel and the doors all close\r\nIf tomorrow finds me on a dead-end road\r\nThere's a promise waiting, just like coming home\r\nSo I can dance into the great unknown\r\nAnd I'll keep on moving, it's only just begun\n\nI trust You'll lead me, forever I will run\n\nBecause...\n\n\n\nYou go before me, You make it clear\n\nYou give me hope and\n\nA future, a future\n\nSo why live in worry, why live in fear\n\nWhen I know You're holding\n\nThe future, the future\n\n(Oh-oh-ooh) the future, the future\n\n(I know You hold) the future, the future\n\n\n\nLike a brand new morning and I'm feeling fine\n\n'Cause my eyes are lifted to Heaven's light\n\nYour plans are perfect, You can do no wrong\n\nSo I'll cast all my cares until they're gone\n\n\n\nAnd I'll keep on moving, it's only just begun\n\nI trust You'll lead me, forever I will run\n\nBecause...\n\n\n\nYou go before me, You make it clear\n\nYou give me hope and\n\nA future, a future\n\nSo why live in worry, why live in fear\n\nWhen I know You're holding\n\nThe future, the future\n\n(Oh-oh-ooh) the future, the future\n\n(I know You hold) the future, the future\n\n(Oh-oh-ooh) the future, the future\n\n(I know You hold) the future, the future\n\n\n\nNo matter what comes next, I got nothing to lose\n\nNo matter what the future holds, I'm trusting in You\n\nNo matter what comes next, I got nothing to lose\n\nNo matter what the future holds... I'm trusting in You\n\n\n\nYou go before me, You make it clear\n\nYou give me hope and\n\nA future, a future\n\nSo why live in worry, why live in fear\n\nWhen I know You're holding\n\nThe future, the future\n\n(Oh-oh-ooh) the future, the future\n\n(I know You hold) the future, the future\n\n(Oh-oh-ooh) the future, the future\n\n(I know You hold) the future, the future"
