I fucking used you\n\nI got just what I want and what I wanna do\n\nYou won't destroy me, you're just annoying me\n\nI'm sitting here on top, so fuck your trophy\n\n\n\nI can't explain how I'm\n\nÂ‘Cause there's no ways to say\n\nThis is who I meant to be\n\nThere's no regrets\n\nI don't care if you believe\n\nThere's no ways to say\n\nThis is who I choose to be\n\nI don't look for trouble\n\nTrouble looks for me\n\nGet some!\n\n\n\nCause there's no excuses\n\nThis is who I meant to be\n\nThere's no regrets, I don't care if you believe\n\nThere's no excuses\n\nThis is who I chose to be\n\nI don't look for trouble, trouble looks for me"
