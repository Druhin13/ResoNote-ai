  "lyrics": "Seabirds fly the salty wind\r\nEast to South–—North to West\r\nCan we go, as they go?\r\nAcross the borderlines\r\n\nI can feel the fear hang heavy on the water\n\nGlinting sharply with the pale moonlight\n\nMothers hold on tightly to your children\n\nAs the waves are breaking violently tonight\n\n\n\nSeabirds fly the salty wind\n\nEast to South–—North to West\n\nCan we go, as they go?\n\nAcross the borderlines\n\n\n\nI hear yelling, I hear crying, I hear praying\n\nAs the ocean threatens us on all four sides\n\nThe water rises deeper every minute\n\nThis vessel cannot bear the burden of our load\n\n\n\nSeabirds fly the salty wind\n\nEast to South–—North to West\n\nCan we go, as they go?\n\nAcross the borderlines\n\n\n\nOne by one the children have grown silent\n\nFrom their mother’s arms, they float away\n\nThe roaring sea will wash our quiet bodies\n\nUpon the foreign shores, but our souls \n\nwill find a way\n\n\n\nAnd with Seabirds fly the salty wind\n\nEast to South–—North to West\n\nSee us go, as they go\n\nAcross the borderlines\n\n\n\n(Grazie a Andrea per questo testo)"
