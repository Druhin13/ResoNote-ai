  "lyrics": "Girl I know we just had the talk\r\nSaid we needed some time to cool it off\r\nAnd I've been on my side of town, just staying low\r\nYou come walking in this little bar\r\nLike you could set off that fire alarm\r\nAnd one little drink won't hurt but don't you know\n\n\n\nGirl we're lightning striking matches\n\nThat's what always happens\n\nWhen we get too close\n\nWhen you start dancing in the neon\n\nWhisper baby dream on\n\nThen the whiskey hits the coke\n\nNext thing you know we're going up in smoke\n\n\n\nWe start out slow like a cigarette\n\nBurn all night like we always did\n\nThey'll be sweeping up the ashes when we go\n\nYeah, we're playing with a fire we can't control\n\nAnd we both know\n\n\n\nGirl we're lightning striking matches\n\nThat's what always happens\n\nWhen we get too close\n\nWhen you start dancing in the neon\n\nWhisper baby dream on\n\nThen the whiskey hits the coke\n\nNext thing you know we're going up in smoke\n\n\n\nGoing up, going up, going up in smoke\n\nGoing up, going up, going up in smoke\n\nGoing up, going up, going up in smoke\n\nGoing up, up, up in smoke\n\n\n\nGirl we're lightning striking matches\n\nThat's what always happens\n\nWhen we get too close\n\nWhen you start dancing in the neon\n\nWhisper baby dream on\n\nThen the whiskey hits the coke\n\nNext thing you know we're going up in smoke\n\nYeah, we're going up in smoke\n\nYeah, we're going up in smoke"
