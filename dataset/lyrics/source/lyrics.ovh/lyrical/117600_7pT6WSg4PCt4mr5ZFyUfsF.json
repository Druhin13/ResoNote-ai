  "lyrics": "She was 19 with a baby on the way\r\nOn the East-side of the city, she was working every day\r\nCleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake\r\nShe was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change\r\nAnd, across town she'd take the bus at night to a one bedroom apartment\r\nAnd then she'd turn on the light\n\nShe would sit down at the table\n\nTell herself that it's alright\n\nShe was waiting on the day that she hoped her baby would arrive\n\nShe'd never be alone\n\nHave someone to hold\n\nAnd when nights were cold, she'd say\n\n\n\nThe world's not perfect but it's not that bad\n\nIf we got each other and that's all we have\n\nI will be your mother and I'll hold your hand\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\nAnd the world's not perfect\n\nWhen the world's not kind\n\nIf we have each other then we'll both be fine\n\nI will be your mother and I'll hold your hand\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\n\n\nThey were 90 and were living out their days on the West-side of the city next to where they got engaged\n\nThey had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they made\n\nAnd their life was never easy they were thankful that they stayed\n\nWith each other and though some times were hard\n\nEven when she made him angry he would never break her heart\n\nAnd they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car\n\nBut they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart\n\nEven at the end, their love was stronger then the day that they first met\n\nThey'd say\n\n\n\nThe world's not perfect but it's not that bad\n\nIf we got each other and that's all we have\n\nI will be your lover and I'll hold your hand\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\nAnd the world's not perfect\n\nWhen the world's not kind\n\nIf we have each other then we'll both be fine\n\nI will be your lover and I'll hold your hand\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\n\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\n\n\nI'm 23 and my folks are getting old\n\nI know they don't have forever and I'm scared to be alone\n\nSo I'm thankful for my sister even though sometimes we fight\n\nWhen high school wasn't easy, she's the reason I survived\n\nI know she'd never leave me\n\nAnd I hate to see her cry\n\nSo I wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side\n\nI wrote this verse to tell her that I'm always by her side\n\nI wrote this verse to tell her that\n\n\n\nThe world's not perfect but it's not that bad\n\nIf we got each other and that's all we have\n\nI will be your brother and I'll hold your hand\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\nAnd the world's not perfect\n\nWhen the world's not kind\n\nIf we have each other then we'll both be fine\n\nI will be your brother and I'll hold your hand\n\nYou should know I'll be there for you\n\n\n\nYou should I know I'll be there for you"
