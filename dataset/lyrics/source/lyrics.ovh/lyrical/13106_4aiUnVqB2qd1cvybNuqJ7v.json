  "lyrics": "So you say you want to be free\r\nBut you're so young\r\nSo you say you want to be free\r\nBut you're so dumb, still coming undone\r\nWhat you think about\n\nWhat you know about is true\n\nWhat you sing about\n\nOnly fills a hole in you\n\nYeah it's all in your mind\n\nWhat you think about\n\nIn your deepest shade of blue\n\n\n\nSo you say you want to be free\n\nWith your hair down\n\nSo you say you want to be free\n\nBut you sold out, yeah you sold out\n\n\n\nWhat you think about\n\nWhat you know is nothing new\n\nWhat you sing about\n\nOnly fills a hole in you\n\nYeah its all in your mind\n\nDrown it out, just drown it out 'till you break through\n\n\n\nGo home to the teenage you\n\nTell you not to worry\n\nStumble through the careless evenings where you dream of who you'll be\n\nGo home to the teenage you\n\nTell you not to worry\n\nStumble through the careless evenings where you dream of who you'll be"
