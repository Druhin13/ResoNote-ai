  "lyrics": "If I found me somebody who could pay me cash money, a dollar for every beer I ever drank\r\nA 10 for every Camel Light, give me 50 for a fist fight, I'd have a million dollars in the bank\r\nWell I'd fish this same ol' hole, hunt these same ol' woods\r\nWouldn't change one thing even if I could\r\nDrink these same ol' Coors, wear these same ol' boots\n\nBe the same ol' me lovin' the same ol' you\n\nBe the same road, same truck, same town\n\nSingin' the same old song\n\n\n\nWish I could get a buck for every one of them green head ducks that I've knocked down in that Mississippi mud\n\nAnd if money grew on trees, then I could by anything\n\nI'd buy the same ol', same old everything\n\n\n\nAnd I'd fish this same ol' hole, hunt these same ol' woods\n\nWouldn't change one thing even if I could\n\nDrink these same ol' Coors, wear these same ol' boots\n\nBe the same ol' me lovin' the same ol' you\n\nBe the same road, same truck, same town\n\nSingin' the same old song\n\n\n\nWell I might buy my daddy one of them brand new Chevy's, take Mama to town, let her pick out somethin' nice\n\n\n\nBut I'd fish this same ol' hole, hunt these same ol' woods\n\nWouldn't change one thing even if I could\n\nDrink these same ol' Coors, wear these same ol' boots\n\nBe the same ol' me lovin' the same ol' you\n\nBe the same road, same truck, same town\n\nSingin' the same old song\n\n\n\nYeah, same road, same truck, same town\n\nSingin' the same old song\n\nSame old song\n\nAnd I'd fish this same ol' hole (same ol' hole)\n\nAnd I'd hunt these same ol' woods (same ol' woods)\n\nAnd I'd drink these same ol' Coors (same ol' Coors)\n\nAnd I'd wear these same ol' boots"
