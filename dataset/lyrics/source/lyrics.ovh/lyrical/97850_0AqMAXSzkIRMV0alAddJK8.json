  "lyrics": "Had a feeling that you'd call me to say you're sorry\r\nInstead you just said it's my mistake\r\nAre you raging up a war for the sake of something to say\r\nWhen am I not to blame\r\nAnd what you got to say about me\r\nI don't know you very well if you're acting like someone else\n\nAnd what you got to say about us\n\nDon't you see this all leads to games, you should start trusting me\n\n\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my ways\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my place\n\n\n\nWell I wish I could say sorry but I don't have much to say\n\nYou won't believe me anyway\n\nI got a thing for causing arguments\n\nBut in my defense, I'm scared to walk away\n\nAnd what I'm trying to say about me\n\nI don't know me very well if I'm acting like someone else\n\nAnd what you got to say about us\n\nDon't you see that I'm here to stay, you should start trusting me\n\n\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my ways\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my place\n\n\n\n(Slow down, won't you come around)\n\n(Slow down, won't you come around to my ways)\n\n\n\nYou don't know me\n\nLike I wish you would\n\nYou don't know me\n\nLike I know you could\n\nI don't want to be misunderstood\n\nCause I don't think you know\n\n\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my ways\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my place\n\n\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my ways\n\nSlow down, won't you come around\n\nSlow down, won't you come around to my place\n\n\n\nSlow down, slow down...\n\nSlow down, slow down..."
