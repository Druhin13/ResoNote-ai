Let me out!\n\nWilliam!\n\nWilliam! Let me out, William!\n\n\n\nAnd I sat there on the steps\n\nConsidering death\n\nThere were only seconds left\n\nOf the night\n\n\n\nAnd I said hell is the sun\n\nBurning forever at the centre of things\n\nA ball on fire at the centre of things\n\nA ball on fire at the centre of things\n\nA brain on fire at the centre of things...\n\nA brain on fire at the centre of things...\n\n\n\nI can’t turn this thing off\n\nIt keeps following me\n\nUsed to be so human now it’s just a machine\n\nI can’t turn this thing off\n\nIt keeps following me\n\nWhen’d you say you were leaving?\n\nWhen’d you really leave?\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Nevada Museum of Art audio guide.
