  "lyrics": "I can't get no satisfaction \nI can't get no satisfaction \n'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try \nI can't get no, I can't get no \nWhen I'm drivin' in my car \n\nAnd that man comes on the radio \n\nHe's tellin' me more and more \n\nAbout some useless information \n\nSupposed to fire my imagination \n\nI can't get no, oh no no no \n\nHey hey hey, that's what I say \n\n\n\nI can't get no satisfaction \n\nI can't get no satisfaction \n\n'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try \n\nI can't get no, I can't get no \n\n\n\nWhen I'm watchin' my TV \n\nAnd that man comes on to tell me \n\nHow white my shirts can be \n\nBut he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke \n\nThe same cigarrettes as me \n\nI can't get no, oh no no no \n\nHey hey hey, that's what I say \n\n\n\nI can't get no satisfaction \n\nI can't get no girl reaction \n\n'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try \n\nI can't get no, I can't get no \n\n\n\nWhen I'm ridin' round the world \n\nAnd I'm doin' this and I'm signing that \n\nAnd I'm tryin' to make some girl \n\nWho tells me baby better come back later next week \n\n'Cause you see I'm on losing streak \n\nI can't get no, oh no no no \n\nHey hey hey, that's what I say \n\n\n\nI can't get no, I can't get no \n\nI can't get no satisfaction \n\nNo satisfaction, no satisfaction, no satisfaction"
