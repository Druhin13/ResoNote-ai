  "lyrics": "When I wear his shirt, it feels like, like his skin over mine. \nAnd the little holes and tears and shreds on in are, are, are the\r\nThe memories of the past that I wasn't there for, but, that somehow I,\r\nI feel like I understand more when it's against my skin. \nIt's an armor, like a barrier from the world. \nLike, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know? \n\nIt makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel...\n\nIt makes me feel like I'm his\n\n(I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his)"
