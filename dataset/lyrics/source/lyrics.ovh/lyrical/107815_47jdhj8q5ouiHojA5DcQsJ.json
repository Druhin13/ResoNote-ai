  "lyrics": "Such a funny little song\nThat I heard you hum at night\nLike a strange lullaby\nThat made me fall asleep\n\nI tried to write it down\n\nJust as soon as I'm awake\n\nBut it didn't came out right\n\nBetter stick to counting sheep\n\n\n\nIs this, is this as good as it gets\n\nThat's just what I ask myself\n\nIs, this, is this as good as it gets\n\nWho can answer that?\n\n\n\nI recall a childhood dream\n\nI was standing on a roof\n\nBut I didn't dare to jump\n\n'Cause perhaps I couldn't fly\n\n\n\nBut you pushed me and I fell\n\nAnd I folded out my wings\n\nAnd I never touched the ground\n\nIt was not time to say goodbye\n\n\n\nIs this, is this, is this, is this, is this\n\nIs this as good as it gets\n\nThat's just what I ask myself\n\nIs this, is this as good as it gets\n\nWho can answer that?\n\n\n\nIs this, is this as good as it gets\n\nThat's just what I ask myself\n\nIs this, is this as good as it gets\n\nWho can answer that?\n\n\n\nIs this, is this as good as it gets\n\nThat's just what I ask myself\n\nIs this, is this as good as it gets\n\nWho can answer that"
