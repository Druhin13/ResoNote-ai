  "lyrics": "Too many days I've felt they were strange\r\nNo wonder I feel like it's never gonna change\r\nI just walk by, I'm thinking 'bout another\r\nYou don't, you don't even wanna know that\r\nToday is just another day\r\nMake my bed, I'm on my way\n\nChecked my texts now I'm feeling like I'm gonna die\n\nI should've took a five degree\n\nTook some time to brush my teeth\n\nWatched a movie, now I'm feeling like I'm gonna cry\n\nI left my peace in the sheets\n\n\n\nI don't know why I'm still here\n\nWhen I should be asleep\n\nI wish I was asleep\n\nI wish I was asleep\n\n\n\nI ain't runnin' from my shit, I'm just stressed out\n\nI ain't far from the light, doing my best now\n\nI'm just really trine swerve in the traffic\n\nFeel the best when I'm lying in the street crack\n\nPretty far from okay, doing pretty bad\n\nI'm just check up out my car, where my keys at?\n\nPulling up and the key's in ignition\n\nI just really think I need some attention\n\n\n\nI should've took a five degree\n\nTook some time to brush my teeth\n\nWatched a movie, now I'm feeling like I wanna cry\n\nI left my peace in the sheets\n\n\n\nI don't know why I'm still here\n\nWhen I should be asleep\n\nI wish I was asleep\n\nI wish I was asleep"
