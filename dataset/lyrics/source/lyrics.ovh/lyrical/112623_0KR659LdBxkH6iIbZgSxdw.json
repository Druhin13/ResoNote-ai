I say the truth, don't lie, I can't pretend\n\nMe and you deep in, pussy wet, she leakin'\n\nYou told me you freaky, show me you a freak then\n\nI walk in with my heater tucked, bitch, don't make me squeeze it up\n\nFast car, yeah this a foreign, top down or leave it up\n\nBack then when I was staving, no, they ain't believe in us\n\nNow we make 'em feel important just to come compete with us\n\nMy lil' baby, she so raw, she like when I beat it up\n\nPull it out, she don't talk, all she do is eat it up\n\nAss fat, it's in the air, so I told her keep it up\n\nAll facts, I make it clap, and even make it reach her guts\n\n\n\nEarly morning, woke up I'm horny\n\nGirl come here and get on me, fuck what's not important\n\nI jumped off the porch then I hopped in a foreign\n\nCircle tight, no more friends, was broke but now I'm touring\n\nNo brakes, I'm going in, Polo drawers, Ralph Lauren\n\nDon't know where I'm going, this shit gettin' annoying\n\nHeard the gossip through the wind, one call, I'm on it\n\nLord forgive me for my sins, prepared for when the storm hits\n\n\n\nPolo drawers, Ralph Lauren\n\nPrepared for when the storm hits\n\nPolo drawers, Ralph Lauren\n\nPrepared for when the storm hits"
