  "lyrics": "Life springs eternal\r\nOn a gaudy neon street\r\nNot that I care at all\r\nI spent the best part of my losing streak\r\nIn an Army Jeep\r\nFor what I can't recall\n\nOh I'm banging on my TV set\n\nAnd I check the odds\n\nAnd I place my bet\n\nI pour a drink\n\nAnd I pull the blinds\n\nAnd I wonder what I'll find\n\nI'm Leaving Las Vegas\n\nLights so bright\n\nPalm sweat, blackjack\n\nOn a Saturday night\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nLeaving for good, for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\n\n\nUsed to be I could drive up to\n\nBarstow for the night\n\nFind some crossroad trucker\n\nTo demonstrate his might\n\nBut these days it seems\n\nNowhere is far enough away\n\nSo I'm leaving Las Vegas today\n\n\n\nI'm Leaving Las Vegas\n\nLights so bright\n\nPalm sweat, blackjack\n\nOn a Saturday night\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nLeaving for good, for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\n\n\nI'm standing in the middle of the desert\n\nWaiting for my ship to come in\n\nBut now no joker, no jack, no king\n\nCan take this loser hand\n\nAnd make it win\n\n\n\nI'm Leaving Las Vegas\n\nLights so bright\n\nPalm sweat, blackjack\n\nOn a Saturday night\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nLeaving for good, for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\n\n\nI quit my job as a dancer\n\nAt the Lido des Girls\n\nDealing blackjack until one or two\n\nSuch a muddly line between\n\nThe things you want\n\nAnd the things you have to do\n\n\n\nI'm Leaving Las Vegas\n\nLights so bright\n\nPalm sweat, blackjack\n\nOn a Saturday night\n\nLeaving Las Vegas\n\nLeaving for good, for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\nI'm leaving for good\n\n\n\nI'm leaving Las Vegas\n\nAnd I won't be back\n\nNo I won't be back\n\nNot this time"
