How could I be so mean?\n\nAnd you'll never know you're still in my dreams\n\nI still reach for you when I fall asleep\n\n\n\nI wish you the best\n\nI hate you, I guess\n\n\n\n'Cause I know that you\n\nDeserve better than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nI know that you\n\nDeserve better than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)\n\n\n\nMaybe in another life, in another place\n\nWe could have another try. Things could end a different way\n\nI hope you find someone, someone that isn't me\n\n'Cause I am just a boy not worthy of a queen\n\n\n\n'Cause I know that you\n\nDeserve better than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)\n\n'Cause I know that you\n\nDeserve better than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nI know that you\n\nDeserve better than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)\n\nBetter than me, better than me (yeah)"
