  "lyrics": "I was born next to my mother\r\nShe sang me to sleep\r\nAnd I grew to adore my father\r\nAs he drowned in a drink\r\nAnd I know that I should be grateful\r\nFor the things they taught\n\nI was raised to be so damn faithful\n\nI didn't need a god\n\nTime is crazy\n\nMy grandmother made up a lie of her life\n\nWhen she died well she gave me\n\nA necklace that came from the sky\n\nSaid my grandfather made it out of gold and a diamond that always reminded him\n\nOf what life could have been\n\n\n\nSo when I say I love you I want to mean it\n\nCause I say a lot of things that I don't mean\n\nAnd when I say I want to I want to mean it\n\nCause I know not to say yes to just anything\n\n\n\nHope to die next to my daughter\n\nLet her sing to me sleep\n\nHaving made the mistakes of a mother\n\nStill I taught her to breathe\n\nWhen you're low and you're deep underwater\n\nStay faithful, remember what you love\n\nSo when the world gets painful\n\nYou become your own god\n\nI could daydream\n\nSit back and think of a mythical life\n\nBut the seasons change and the tragic thing is that you can't live it twice\n\nI try to be brave and tell her that we'll meet again that we'd met before\n\nBut I'm not really so sure\n\n\n\nSo when I say I love you I want to mean it\n\nCause I say a lot of things that I don't mean\n\nAnd when I say I want to I want to mean it\n\nCause I know not to say yes to just anything"
