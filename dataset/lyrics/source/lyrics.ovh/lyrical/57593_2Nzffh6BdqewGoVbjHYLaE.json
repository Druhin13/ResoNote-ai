  "lyrics": "This side of my face, makes a lot of mistakes\nEar hears what it wants, when it don't it longs for the day\nWhen it can't, won't, imitate, the fickle state of the grave\nGrace on my ears, def' death, try'na raise up\nWickedness try'na tempt with\nGot a heart with a mind that don't mine being wicked\n\nSo my heart tell my mind tell my ears better mind it's\n\nbusiness\n\nNot a concept this is,\n\nConstant science of organized religion gotta listen if you\n\nwanna hear it\n\n\n\nThey say\n\nSpeak up boy, cat got your tongue\n\nBut I tend to play it dumb in an attempt to run from\n\nBecause when I speak, the heart leaks\n\nAnd you get a brief peek deep inside to see where it comes\n\nfrom\n\nBecause here's the deal, the tongue is small\n\nBut still it's strong enough to curse or kill\n\nDestroy or build, sink or steer a ship\n\nLift up a man, cause a person to trip, hurt or heal\n\nSpouting and arousing, rabble-rousing\n\nSounding deep but drowning\n\nKilling everyone around me\n\nI need to put a muzzle on my mouth\n\nTo avoid everything coming out going south\n\nI mock men, and patronize\n\nOrganize lies but it's all disguised\n\nMy speech is pathetic, instead of religious rhetoric\n\nGod give me a better phonetic etiquette\n\n\n\nWith these hands, I build or destroy\n\nBecome a doctor or a chef or possibly a corner boy\n\nWho handle things, hand full of rings, neck full of chains\n\nMight get jammed up or get handcuffed for throwing my hands\n\nfor the set I claim\n\nCould be a fist, or a finger in the middle of this\n\ncircumference\n\nBut it's all contingent on what my heart pumps into it\n\nCould be a handshake, better yet man it could be a peace\n\nsign\n\nOr it could be the middle of the night, flashing lights,\n\npolice yelling can they see my hands\n\n\n\nOh yes your Eye-ness, I will obey what you say and chase\n\nyour craving\n\nEye was misbehaving, overdosed and choked I need the\n\nEye-mlich\n\nEye candy ent-eye-cing it's eye-cing on the cake\n\nWhatever I see my eyes rate, if I'm unsatisfied I'm irate\n\nLook down that's when my eyes break, deep down I know my\n\neyes are sick\n\nEye-dols in my heart, I stab myself in the back when my eyes\n\npick\n\nThere's a v-eye-ris in my iris, eye was blinded, close my\n\neye lids\n\nSee my Savior laying down His righteous life and saying \"eye\n\nforgive\"\n\n\n\nOrganize, organize, organize me\n\nIf You have my heart then You have every part of me\n\nWhat I hear, what I say, what I feel, what I see\n\nIf You have my heart then You have every part of me"
