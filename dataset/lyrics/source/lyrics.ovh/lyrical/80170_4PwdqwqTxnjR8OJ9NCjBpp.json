  "lyrics": "I'm falling apart\r\nQuite beautifully\r\nI look at the stars\r\nWonder which one you might be\r\nI could have been more\r\nBut I was so afraid\n\nAnd all of my words\n\nJust didn't hold enough weight\n\n\n\nI wish I could reach\n\nPast the stars, past the moon\n\nI just want to know\n\nHow far from me to you\n\nI wish that we wrote\n\nMy God, I was so proud\n\nIt's just the words in my throat\n\nI could never get them out\n\n\n\nI see you now\n\nIn every wind and word\n\nYou finally got your feet off the ground\n\nNow you're free as a bird\n\n\n\nWild flowers in half bloom\n\nDull colors paint the room\n\nHow could I ever blame you?\n\nWild flowers in half bloom\n\nDull colors paint the room\n\nHow could I ever blame you?"
