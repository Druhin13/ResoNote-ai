  "lyrics": "Lyrical leapfrog put you in a deep fog\r\nAsleep cog in the wheel, steal like a cheap dog\r\nReblog all you want, I'll kick a new style\r\nTrue guile to do miles of damage while you manage to step in a doodoo pile\r\nI got so many rhymes, they need to overlap\r\nClover sap at the root to pick my own luck\n\nStruck by the thought that my label’s shoulder tap\n\nOlder rap is newer, if you know what I mean\n\nI hold a map in my headphones, rock stereo\n\nThere we go where we know, fairy grow barely no\n\nHairy oh cherry blow, spare me though\n\nThere's always something new under the sun\n\nNo one does it like you so it’s never been done\n\nWhen I break new ground, take you down\n\nQuake through surroundings, crash land on a snare, cash band Pluck a bassline, twayang twang, face flying, mash hand\n\nGas gland, plcccch, old styles trash canned\n\nYass man first line is second line like a brass band\n\nLast stand echo, how'd techno get so let low?\n\nTwo in one, new and fun\n\nFor the lyrical leapfrog, precognition\n\nWishing for recognition in two ways:\n\nClarity and mega-high-fives, when you have A.D.D\n\nSuperlyricism is something to concentrate on\n\nEverything else is too easy\n\nYou trace the flows’ progress like a little dot\n\nIt rewires, requires your brain, keeps a unique log\n\nSeek opportunities to go hard as possible\n\nObstacles include insecurity and bad habits and autocorrect\n\nNot so as checked, sometimes I’m mad (sad) I’m sad (bad)\n\nI second that emotion, it’s called a secondary emotion\n\nElementary notion, confusion fusion\n\nCut through illusion delusion\n\nIntrusive thoughts, elusive slots\n\nTandem, two things at once\n\nI wish an Irish Sheepdog would arrive with cheap grog\n\nPeople sleep like a log on me like I'm treefrog in a peat bog\n\nI put a pot of message in there with a mess of pottage\n\nWe're bugs, beer suds on a giant keg\n\nFear chugs, iron egg, near duds\n\nIt's clear cuz that we're ants, mere plants\n\nDeer ticks, fear tricks, weird mix, lyrics\n\nWe're barely soot sprites, good night"
