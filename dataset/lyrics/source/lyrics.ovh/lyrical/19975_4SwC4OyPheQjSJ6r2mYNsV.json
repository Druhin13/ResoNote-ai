  "lyrics": "(Oh, boy!)\r\nWhen you try to compete, but they've already won\r\nAnd the family you lift, it weighs a ton\r\nWhen everything's already said and done\r\nAnd you're standing alone in the mid-day sun\n\n\n\nAnd the water's dried up upon the shore\n\nAnd you just cannot give them any more\n\nWhen you're finally rich, but they're still poor\n\nThere's gonna be something you can't ignore\n\n\n\nThus, the world is set on fire\n\nYeah, I tried to warn off everyone, but they never did learn\n\nYeah, I'm only scared of dying if I've got something left to give\n\n\n\nWhen you're lightyears away from getting off\n\nAnd all of the radicals are getting soft\n\nWhen the star [?]\n\nAnd the rest of the world is too aloft\n\n\n\nWhen the water's dried up upon the shore\n\nAnd you just cannot give them any more\n\nWhen you're finally rich, but they're still poor\n\nThere's gonna be something you can't ignore\n\n\n\nThus, the world is set on fire\n\nYeah, I tried to warn off everyone, but they never did learn\n\nYeah, I'm only scared of dying if I have something left to give"
