Cuba, Venezuela\n\nI have seen a million\n\nI don't have no issues\n\nMy DM's are filled with Baby E I miss you's\n\nI'm always about to fly\n\nYou know I don'tr spend the night\n\nYou know I'm a ride or die\n\nI ain't never switching sides\n\nRollie got it dripped in ice\n\nFuck these bitches in their prime\n\nCart their feelings in the ride\n\nDirty money slipped and slide\n\n\n\nIf a bitch with me she drive, royalty\n\nAll I ever ask is fuckin' loyalty\n\nIf I go, I'm gonna go in a minute\n\nBurn my ashes and just mix it with the sand\n\n\n\nTrappin' 4 a livin'\n\nMomma said I shoulda died\n\nI woke up this morning, can't believe I'm still alive\n\nFightin' 'til the end though,\n\nI will never take a dive\n\nRather burn it all before I ever tell the five\n\n\n\nTrappin' 4 a livin'\n\nMomma said I shoulda died\n\nI woke up this morning, can't believe I'm still alive\n\nFightin' 'til the end though,\n\nI will never take a dive\n\nRather burn it all before I ever tell the five"
