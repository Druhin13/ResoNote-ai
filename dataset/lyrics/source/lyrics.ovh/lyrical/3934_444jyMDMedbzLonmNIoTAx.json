  "title": "It's Simple",
  "lyrics": "A good song in your ear\r\nA hot night a cold beer\r\nA woman to put your arm around\r\nA charcoal weekend\r\nNew jokes and old friends\n\nA red white and blue country town\n\nThe one you had to leave to find out\n\n\n\nLove is for making\n\nKids are for raising\n\nAnd home is that place in your heart\n\nDon't overthink it\n\nDon't complicate it\n\nThe secret to life ain't that hard\n\nIt's simple\n\n\n\nA bird dog and a backyard\n\nThree chords and a guitar\n\nSunday school Jesus loves you\n\nA breeze through a screen door\n\nA talk on a front porch\n\nThe old man next door telling you\n\n\n\nThere'll be ups and downs\n\nAin't nobody saying it's easy"
