  "lyrics": "This is the place where nobody comes from\r\nPerfect strangers in this desert town\r\nJust out of flame and looking for favours\r\nHungry players when the deals go down\r\nYou get a hollow heart from shallow breathing\n\nAnd a see-through smile like the ones on T.V.\n\nThis is the land of thrills and money where you\n\nHit the edge and you drift out to sea\n\n\n\nIt seems so real, looks so good\n\nBut you'd give it all up and you'd start again if you thought you could\n\nAnd it sounds so sweet, feels so right\n\nBut it leaves you cold in the middle of the night\n\n\n\nStep right up, lay your money down\n\nIf you're looking to buy love in the big town\n\nLift you up, tear you down\n\nLeave you begging for more love in the big town\n\n\n\nDown in the street with the waiters and mystics\n\nWhen you got faith in nothing, you just fantasize\n\nYou look for a flame but you'd fall for a flicker\n\nIn those angel faces and those cowboy eyes\n\n\n\nThey seem so real and they look so good\n\nAnd with a bit of persuasion you really believe you know you could\n\nTastes so sweet, feels so right\n\nBut it leaves you cold in the heart of the night\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nStep right up, (lay your) money down\n\nIf you're looking to find love in the big town\n\nLift you up, tear you down\n\nThey'll leave you begging for more love in the big town\n\n\n\nOh you learn to use all your desperation\n\nTill it works its way into your soul\n\nThen you find out that you slowly lose control\n\n\n\nchorus repeats 2x..."
