  "lyrics": "Here we go, a get in, from heroes to villains\r\nUsed to be your Romeo, but we were both were jilted\r\nA couple of times, so we had a slippery slope to deal with\r\nBut still it gave me hope\r\nThat we'll get through it together, a severed earlobe\r\nMailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope\n\nWould be dope, but\n\nWhat kind of lengths can you go?\n\nPull a Vincent Van Gogh, just to convince a damn ho\n\nTo be a housewife who outright lies\n\nShe's blackout drunk, now she's backin' out my drive\n\nI ran outside, why's she tryna act out?\n\nShe's just about my size\n\nHit me in the mouth twice\n\nGuys, when someone you die for sticks a steak knife in your heart\n\nDo you try more?\n\nAnother late night in\n\nShe stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in\n\nAnd all we do's fight more\n\nAnd I ain't violent\n\nBut she's goin' through my drawers to plant the K-Y in\n\nI'm gettin' accused by a whore\n\nWho smells like cyanides and\n\nWho has probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight, nine men\n\nI'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens\n\nBitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win\n\nPut up a new high score, beat this game I'm in\n\nAnd here's some two-ply for\n\nWhen you date my friends, in order to wipe your ass\n\nWhen you moved your bowels\n\nWhen we renewed our vows\n\nThis the thanks I get\n\nI'm waitin' for the date\n\nI can hear you say, \"Marshall, what a skank I've been\n\nAnd there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him\"\n\nGot your tubes tied for him\n\nGot that boob job for him\n\nHurts me to my core\n\nBut the pain I'm in, after you I swore\n\nTo make the gray skies in\n\nHere comes the rays like wind\n\nYou get a pay hike, and, am I the good guy, or?\n\nDo I just play like him and hope that he dumps you?\n\nIt's like the dream come true, just to scream \"Fuck you\"\n\nGuess you take life in the same way you play dice then\n\n'Cause you just look at me and roll them little snakes eyes in\n\n\n\nSince you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, they'll call me guilty\n\nYou bought the jury, they'll call me guilty, even though you know the real me\n\nYou can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever\n\nAnd I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy\n\n'Cause this ain't what love looks like\n\nYou can't be the cheater, convincin' nonbeliever\n\nAnd I ain't in my feelings, I'm out but I let you say that you're the good guy\n\nThey like, \"You're the good guy,\" they like, they like\n\nThey like, \"You're the good guy\""
