  "lyrics": "I can't always rely on my desires\r\nBut I treat them like the Messiah\r\nI can't always rely on my desires\r\nBut I treat them like the Messiah\r\nWhatever it is that gives that feeling that we can't live without\n\nThe joys we try to get that only God can give we highly doubt\n\nWhat allures and arouses the heart we can't figure out\n\nBut it's the quickest way to account for what we prize\n\nAnd are most proud about\n\nThese gods make promises but always lie to us\n\nThe kind of lies that says they'll keep us safe and satisfy us\n\nWe blame the lies outside of us\n\nBut it's the lie that lies inside that captures the depth of desires and false messiahs\n\nWe seek pleasure in anything, we overestimate everything\n\nEndlessly trusting in empty entities\n\nSecretly searching for anything in moments of blessing\n\nWhile exiting edicts of meaning over our ecstasy\n\nWhen a good God gives good gifts we generally tend to twist the list\n\nAnd take the list of good gifts that God tends to give and make general gods out of gifts\n\nI suppose what exposes the worship in most of us\n\nIs a close look at most of our thoughts, fears, and emotions\n\n\n\nNo matter what I do\n\nI can't ever make it last\n\nI just repeat my past\n\nI'm so broken\n\nSo much I thought I knew\n\nAll the things that I pursued\n\nI'm worse off than before\n\n\n\nI can't always rely on my desires\n\nBut I treat them like the Messiah\n\nI can't always rely on my desires\n\nBut I treat them like the Messiah\n\n\n\nThe saddest fact is that I search for satisfaction\n\nAs if I lack it when in fact I lack nothing\n\nThat's the reason for my lackluster prayer life\n\nAnd my lust for distractions, it's so easy to see in hindsight\n\nI must confess it's the mess I acknowledge when I'm\n\nStylin on my responsibilities and don't apologize, but make exuses\n\nLike my physical exhaustion is a license for narcissism\n\nAnd speaking recklessly without caution\n\nI often wonder, why I'm so awkward in conversations\n\nWishing I could switch places, envious of others\n\nBut my envy is a reflex of my ignorance\n\nCause I don't know the details of their daily existence\n\nI just assume the weight I carry is the heaviest\n\nBut I've never been a heavweight\n\nMy legs get heavy when I wait\n\nHope deferred so I prefer the immediate\n\nAnd exchange the true God for what seems for expedient\n\nIt's meaningless\n\n\n\nI can't always rely on my desires\n\nBut I treat them like the Messiah\n\nI can't always rely on my desires\n\nBut I treat them like the Messiah\n\n\n\nHelp us not be haste when it comes to temporal blessings\n\nAnd always see them for what they're actually meant to be\n\nA mere extension of Your love and kindness\n\nExtended to an undeserved humanity\n\nHelp us not see greater value in the gifts You give\n\nAnd not become distracted from their intended desires\n\nMay we regard the world and all that is in it\n\nAs nothing compared to the satisfaction of knowing\n\nOur Messiah"
