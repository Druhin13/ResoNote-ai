  "lyrics": "You learn a couple things when you get to my age\r\nLike friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark\r\nWhen your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times\r\nYou're getting spirituality enlightened at 29\r\nSo just give yourself a try\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give?\n\n\n\nI found a grey hair in one of my zoots\n\nLike context in a modern debate I just took it out\n\nThe only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside\n\nAnd getting STD's at 27 really isn't the vibe\n\nJane took her own life at 16, she was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm\n\nAnd I was 25 and afraid to go outside\n\nA millenial that baby-boomers like\n\n\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give?\n\n\n\n'And what would you say to your younger self?'\n\nGrowing a beard's quite hard\n\nAnd whiskey never starts to taste nice\n\nAnd you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny\n\n'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs\n\nAnd spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online\n\n\n\nSo just give yourself a try\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give yourself a try?\n\nWon't you give?"
