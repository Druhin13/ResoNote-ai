  "title": "Next To You",
  "lyrics": "I fell asleep at the edge of the yard\r\nWith the nightingales and the broken cars\r\nIn the hope that you'd find me there someday\r\nAnd musicians play at a bar across the street\r\nAnd their lonely patrons are on their feet\r\nBut the night don’t give up that easy\n\nAnd somewhere in a desert another bomb fell\n\nAnd the architects they were giving them hell\n\nIn the boat that they sailed in 'til morning\n\n\n\nBut anytime I fall asleep next to you\n\nWe turn off the lights and look up at the stars\n\nAnd a streetlight slightly flickers in the dark\n\nAs I hear you breathing next to me\n\n\n\nAnd millions of people keep checking their phones\n\nAs a Labrador keeps licking the bone\n\nThat it hid in the earth 5 years ago\n\nThe director tells the actress to say her lines quick\n\nThere ain’t no time here to overthink\n\nThe world’s changed, and it’s changing so quickly\n\nAnd can’t we build a skyscraper 20 miles thick\n\nAnd fill it up with all the shit that we bought\n\nAt the president’s impeachment sale\n\n\n\nBut it’s alright when I fall asleep next to you\n\nWe turn off the lights and look up at the stars\n\nAnd a streetlight slightly flickers in the dark\n\nAs the morning creeps in softly\n\n\n\nOh anytime I fall asleep next to you\n\nWe turn off the lights and look up at the stars\n\nAnd a streetlight slightly flickers in the dark\n\nAs I hear you breathing next to me"
