  "lyrics": "Take me, break me\r\nTurn me on my head and shake me\r\n'Cause I'm driving under the influence of love\r\nTest me, undress me\r\nHell, go right ahead and arrest me\r\n'Cause I'm driving under the influence of love\n\n\n\nI had me a good long look and I like everything I see\n\nI've been on a bender, now I surrender\n\nYou're gonna have to throw the book at me\n\nI'm sunk, I'm trouble\n\nUsed to be single now I'm seeing double\n\nI'm driving under the influence of love\n\n\n\nI'm on a roll, I'm outta control\n\nQuick, somebody take the wheel\n\nDriving blind, I'm outta my mind\n\nIf you were in my shoes, you know how it feels\n\nI'm reckless, I'm a libal\n\nYou're the key to my survival\n\nI'm driving under the influence of love\n\n\n\nSo pay jailer, set me free\n\nOr lock me up and throw away the key\n\nDriving under the influence of love\n\nGuilty as charged, I got no [?]\n\nDriving under the influence of love"
