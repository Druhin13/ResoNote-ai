Don't argue!)\n\nWhy must you record my phone calls?\nAre you planning a bootleg LP?\nSaid you'd been threatened by gangsters\nNow it's you that's threatening me\n\nCan't fight corruption with con tricks\nThey use the law to commit crime\nI dread to think what the future'll bring\nWhen we're living in gangster times\n(Don't call me Scarface!)\n\nDon't interrupt while I'm talking\nOr they'll confiscate all your guitars\nCatch 22 says if I sing the truth\n\nThey won't make me an overnight star\n\nDon't offer us legal protection\nThey use the law to commit crime\nI dread to think what the future'll bring\nWhen we're living in real gangster times\n\n(Bernie Rhodes knows. Don't argue!)"
