  "lyrics": "It's been a long time on the road\r\nWithout a soul to call my own\r\nI'm tired of talking to the cards\r\nI miss the flowers in the yard\r\nThere's no place like home\n\nNo place like home\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be than home\n\n\n\nI'm gonna move out of the street\n\nStack some stones maybe grow some wheat\n\nBuild a fire for a little heat\n\nHave someone curl up at my feet\n\n\n\nThere's no place like home\n\nNo place like home\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be than home\n\n\n\nI wanna hang up some pretty things\n\nFrom my suitcase full of dreams\n\nMaybe a letter or an old post card\n\nOr that paper star stole from a jar\n\n\n\nThere's no place like home\n\nNo place like home\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be than home\n\n\n\nThe sweetest words I ever heard\n\nIs welcome home\n\nIt's been a long and dusty road\n\n\n\nThere's a place that's meant for us\n\nFull of faith, hope, love and trust\n\nI'll keep trudging up the road\n\nBut someday I'll be going home\n\n\n\nThere's no place like home\n\nNo place like home\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be than home\n\nHome, home, home\n\nHome"
