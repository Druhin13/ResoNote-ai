  "lyrics": "Walking on the rooftops\r\nTalking of times\r\nWith our eyes a glowing\r\nLike the city lights\r\nShe stands on the ledge,\r\nShe says, 'it looks so high'\n\n\n\nYou know it's a...\n\n\n\nLong way down\n\nFeels like a long way down\n\nFeels like a long way down\n\nLike a long way down\n\nSo honey don't leave, don't leave,\n\nPlease don't leave me now\n\n\n\nCuz I can feel the rivers\n\nWinding through the lands\n\nTwo lines, and a poet\n\nLike a kind old rye\n\nYou know we could talk in that language\n\nOnly we understand\n\n\n\nBut you know..\n\n\n\nIt's a long way down\n\nYou know it's a long way down\n\nFeels like a long way down\n\nLove it feels like a long way down\n\nSo honey don't leave, don't leave,\n\nPlease don't leave me now"
