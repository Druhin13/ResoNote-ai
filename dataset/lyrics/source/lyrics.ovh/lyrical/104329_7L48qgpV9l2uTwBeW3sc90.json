  "lyrics": "I told you once, I told you twice\r\nKeep it up and they might come calling for ya\r\nTake it up as good advice\r\nYou’re all they want now that they’ve got everybody\r\nSometimes it feels like we’re just walking away\n\n\n\nYou’re breaking hearts, you’re breaking news\n\nBut it’s alright coz the summer days are numbered\n\nAnd one by one, and two by four\n\nDon’t close the door when you’re talking to a stranger\n\n\n\nSometimes it feels like we’re just walking away\n\n(We’re walking out of step and walking out of line\n\nYou’re taking all the money, taking all the time)\n\n\n\nTurn forever, forever\n\nIt’s all that you had\n\nBut you lost it, you said\n\nYou lost it, you said, in your way"
