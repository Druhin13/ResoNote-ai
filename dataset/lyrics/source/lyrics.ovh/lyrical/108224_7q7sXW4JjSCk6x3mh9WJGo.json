  "lyrics": "You're the only one who's ever heard my song\r\nI might be lonely now, but I won't be lonely long\r\nTake a look at me, baby\r\nTell me, what do you see?\r\nTake a look at me, baby\r\nYou're lookin' at the brand new me\n\n\n\nI'm like a total stranger knockin' at your door\n\nNo need to worry 'bout the way I was before\n\nIt's a new love story\n\nSo read every line\n\nYou be the judge and the jury\n\nI'm guilty of the crime\n\n\n\nI'm guilty of, guilty of the crime\n\nOf lovin' you, baby\n\nGuilty of, guilty of the crime\n\n\n\nI'm savin' all my lovin' just for you\n\n'Cause there's nothin' more that I would rather do\n\nIt's a new love story\n\nGot to read every line\n\nYou be the judge and the jury\n\nI'm guilty of the crime\n\n\n\nI'm guilty of, guilty of the crime\n\nOf lovin' you, baby\n\nGuilty of, guilty of the crime\n\nOf lovin' you, baby\n\nGuilty of, guilty of the crime\n\nYes, I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime\n\nOf lovin' you, lovin' you\n\n\n\nI'm guilty of, guilty of the crime\n\nYes I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Sugumar for these lyrics)"
