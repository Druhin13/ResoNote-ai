  "lyrics": "How can I just let you walk away,\nJust let you leave without a trace?\nWhen I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\n\nHow can you just walk away from me\n\nWhen all I can do is watch you leave?\n\n'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain\n\nAnd even shared the tears\n\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\n\n\n\nSo take a look at me now\n\nWell there's just an empty space\n\nAnd there's nothing left here to remind me\n\nJust the memory of your face\n\nTake a look at me now\n\n\n\nWell there's just an empty space\n\nAnd you coming back to me is against the odds\n\nAnd that's what I've got to face, oh\n\n\n\nI wish I could just make you turn around\n\nTurn around and see me cry\n\nThere's so much I need to say to you\n\nSo many reasons why\n\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\n\n\n\nSo take a look at me now\n\nWell there's just an empty space\n\nAnd there's nothing left here to remind me\n\nJust the memory of your face\n\n\n\nTake a look at me now \n\nWell there's just an empty space\n\nBut to wait for you is all I can do\n\nAnd that's what I've got to face\n\n\n\nTake a good look at me now\n\n'Cause I'll still be standing here\n\nAnd you coming back to me is against the odds\n\nAnd it's what I've got to face\n\nTake a look at me now"
