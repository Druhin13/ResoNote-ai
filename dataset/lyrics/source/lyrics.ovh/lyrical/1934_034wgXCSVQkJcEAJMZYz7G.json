  "lyrics": "The station was empty\r\nThe trains were all gone\r\nI reached in my pocket\r\nAnd I wanted for dawn\r\nChorus:\n\nThe clock played drums\n\nAnd I hummed the sax\n\nAnd the wind whistled down\n\nThe railroad tracks\n\nHey three for a quarter\n\nOne for a dime\n\nI'll bet it's tomorrow\n\nBy Rocky Mountain time\n\n\n\nI walked in the restaurant\n\nFor something to do\n\nThe waitress yelled at me\n\nAnd so did the food\n\nAnd the water taste funny\n\nWhen you're far from your home\n\nBut it's only the thirsty\n\nThat hunger to roam\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\n\n\nWe'll build us a castle on Main Street\n\nAnd pretend that we're down on the farm\n\nHell, we'll hold out as long as we have to\n\nThen we'll twist off each other's arm\n\n\n\nChrist I'm so mixed up and lonely\n\nI can't even make friends with my brain\n\nI'm too young to be where I'm going\n\nBut I'm too old to go back again\n\n\n\n(Repeat first verse and chorus)"
