  "lyrics": "Flip the switch, needing light\r\nBlowing smoke to pass the time\r\nGive an inch, losing miles\r\n'Til I slowly fall behind\r\nSomebody tell me what to live for?\r\nKnocking at the same doors can't get in\n\nI'm dying just to get more\n\nScreaming at the sky \"Lord answer me\"\n\n\n\nI'm a prisoner of my mind\n\nI live inside of my pain\n\nIn solitary confines, no visitors allowed on my cage\n\nI got rank like I'm Shabba, that's why a nigga stay behind shades (Let's go)\n\nI got plan behind these Pradas and I got shame behind my rage (Yeah)\n\nNever let 'em see sweat\n\nRag on my head like Raja bless a day, hit 'em in the ribs as a kid\n\nLotta shit changed since then, seen real nigga do fake\n\nSeen phony niggas gettin' bread, put some on the books from the crooks and the county\n\nYou ain't one of us get the fuck from around me\n\nMoney on my mind so I look like a bounty\n\nTwelve jumpin' out of foot to surround me\n\nThey can't hold me, AK loaded\n\nYoung Fresco got a MAC like Goldie\n\nCall Lil' Moe, he'll whack your homie\n\nViolent thoughts, I'm sad and lonely\n\nHow these hoes tryna Average Joe me?\n\nLike a nigga ain't God level\n\nGo tooth and nail with my demons\n\nI'ma raise hell 'till I'm on God level somebody-\n\n\n\nSomebody tell me what to live for? (Let's go)\n\nKnocking at the same doors can't get in (Hey)\n\nI'm dying just to get more\n\nScreaming at the sky \"Lord answer me\"\n\nGive me a sign, losing my mind\n\nLosing it for real this time\n\nTell me what to live for?\n\nScreaming at the sky \"Lord answer me\"\n\n\n\nWhat's up bro? This is Mar dawg\n\nGive me y'all shout out man, hope everything's going great for you\n\nHope everything's going great for the tour, Drew Love and the entire THEY. camp\n\nTake the world by storm. Stay positive with every step that you guys do, stay together, grind hard on. Outwork the competition and always have belief. Belief in yourself, belief in the camp and belief in God. Love life and live life. I love you man"
