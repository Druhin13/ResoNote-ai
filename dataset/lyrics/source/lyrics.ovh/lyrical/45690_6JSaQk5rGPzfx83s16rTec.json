  "lyrics": "We carried you in our arms\nOn Independence Day\nAnd now you'll throw us all aside\nAnd put us all away\n\nOh, what dear daughter 'neath the sun\n\nCould treat a father so?\n\nTo wait upon him hand and foot\n\nYet always answer, \"No\"\n\n\n\nTears of rage, tears of grief\n\nWhy must I always be the thief?\n\nCome to me now, you know we're so low\n\nAnd life is brief\n\n\n\nIt was all so very painless\n\nWhen you ran out to receive\n\nAll that false instruction\n\nWhich we never could believe\n\n\n\nAnd now the heart is filled with gold\n\nAs if it was a purse\n\nBut, oh, what kind of love is this\n\nWhich goes from bad to worse?\n\n\n\nTears of rage, tears of grief\n\nWhy must I always be the thief?\n\nCome to me now, you know we're so low\n\nAnd life is brief\n\n\n\nWe pointed you the way to go\n\nAnd scratched your name in sand\n\nThough you thought it was nothing more\n\nThan a place for you to stand\n\n\n\nI want you to know that while we watched\n\nYou discovered that no one would be true\n\nThat I myself was among the ones who thought\n\nIt was just a childish thing to do\n\n\n\nTears of rage, tears of grief\n\nWhy must I always be the thief?\n\nCome to me now, you know we're so low\n\nAnd life is brief"
