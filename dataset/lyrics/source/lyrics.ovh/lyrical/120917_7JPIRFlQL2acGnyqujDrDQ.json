  "lyrics": "I suppose one, one, one who hasn't seen\r\nThe earlier frames\r\nCould say I am advancing up this road\r\nI am advancing\r\nPale as a banshee sun\n\nThink I should stop checking myself out\n\nIn the windows of cars\n\nWhen I could see my future in her pictures of relatives\n\n\n\nHow simple my heart can be\n\nHow simple my heart can be\n\nFrightens me\n\n\n\nDon't worry we will both find out\n\nJust not together\n\n\n\nYour hand was on me\n\nIt seemed like you were being sweet\n\nHere I am again\n\nAt the reserve to drink\n\n\n\nIt's not that I thought\n\nLike all of a sudden you change\n\nWe were covered in each other's snot\n\nIn my childhood bed\n\nWell it seemed like we were being sweet\n\nHer pictures of relatives\n\n\n\nHow simple my heart can be\n\nHow simple my heart can be\n\nFrightens me"
