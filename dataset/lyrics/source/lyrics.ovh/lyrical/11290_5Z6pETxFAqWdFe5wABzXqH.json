  "lyrics": "I’m leaving\r\nThe words fall out my mouth\r\nAnd onto the floor\r\nI am needing\r\nTo pack up my bags and walk right out the door\r\nThis is goodbye\n\nI’ll roll the windows down\n\nOn my green Chevrolet, and I\n\nDon’t know where I’m going\n\nJust know I can’t stay\n\n\n\nMight make it to Memphis\n\nBut if that ain’t far enough\n\nI'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Mizzoula\n\nSo fast that the hurt can’t catch up\n\nI’m burning your memory\n\nOne mile at a time\n\nAll the way to Tacoma\n\nBy then I hope you'll be out of my mind\n\n\n\nI’m thinking\n\nWith a truck stop song and a cold cup of coffee\n\nThat I’m drinking\n\nAnd I’m hurting like hell\n\nBut honey how could I not be\n\nYou made me\n\nThe joker, the fool\n\nThe last one to know so I’m gonna put\n\nMountains and deserts and rivers between us\n\nGo as far as I can go\n\n\n\nMight make it to Memphis\n\nBut that ain’t far enough\n\nI'll speed down the highway to Tulsa, Mizzoula\n\nSo fast that the hurt can’t catch up\n\nI’m burning your memory\n\nOne mile at a time\n\nAll the way to Tacoma\n\nBy then you'll be out of my mind\n\n\n\nMight leave some tears in Topeka\n\nA couple of sleepless nights in Cheyenne\n\nEvery time I miss you\n\nI’ll hit the gas as fast as I can\n\nMight make it to Memphis\n\nPast the Kansas City line\n\nAll the way to Tacoma\n\nBy then you'll be out of my mind\n\nAll the way to Tacoma\n\nBy then you'll be out of my mind"
