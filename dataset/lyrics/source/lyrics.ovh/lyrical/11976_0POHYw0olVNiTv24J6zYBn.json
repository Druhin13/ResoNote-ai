  "lyrics": "Every I time I see the west\r\nA hole fills up inside my chest\r\nA meadow where I left you there\r\nHas washed away in winter's grave\r\nEvery time I see your face\r\nIt washes all the skin away\n\nAnd hold you fast, embody me\n\nYou left me with the holes you see\n\n\n\nYou can stay, you can stay\n\nI wandered off but found the way\n\nAnd all these cliffs surrounding me\n\nThe holes are patched in thanks in part to you"
