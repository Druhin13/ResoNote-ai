  "lyrics": "We were born into a battle we never got to choose\r\nAnd every night that cigarette would burn down like a fuse\r\nIt would glow until it'd blow and brother hang on tight\r\nI was raised up in that darkness, I'm still looking for the light\r\nI poured the hurt into my music, the bourbon down my throat\n\nLeft me broken like the bottles and bendy like them roads\n\nOnce I thought I almost made it and thought I'd be alright\n\nBut no she had to go, leave me looking for the light\n\n\n\nHoo\n\nHoo\n\nHoo\n\n\n\nAnd I'm wandering, and wondering where this all will lead\n\nWith no more tears to cry and no more blood to bleed\n\nI could give in to this darkness and who knows, someday I might\n\nTill then I'll keep on walking, keep on looking for the light\n\n\n\nSinging\n\nHoo\n\nHoo\n\nHoo"
