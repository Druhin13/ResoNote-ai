  "lyrics": "Bebe’s in remand right now\r\nAnd she’ll be there for a while\r\nFor the wounding of a rent a cop\r\nAnd a ram raid in Sunshine\r\nShe’s right there on CCTV\r\nForgetting to take her medication\n\nBut Ruby says her lawyer will get\n\nThe best deal that they can make her\n\nBut then I grew up around her family\n\nAnd they were such a bunch of losers\n\nAnchored only to each other\n\nOn a sea of vodka cruisers\n\nShe could say anything\n\nAt anytime\n\nSo any mention of plea bargains\n\nIs making everybody feel uptight\n\n\n\nYou let my tyres down\n\nI’d give you anything at any time\n\nBut you let my tyres down\n\n\n\nI picked her car up from the depot\n\nI had my lunch at China Rose\n\nAnd then I snorted half a gram of\n\nAustralia’s finest home made coke\n\n\n\nAnd a child was mauled by bull ants\n\nOutside the Highpoint Shopping Centre\n\nWhile a Toorak tractor benefact\n\nBit down on her placenta\n\nAnd an army surplus loner\n\nCombed the outskirts of parole\n\nBut it’s raining in Victoria\n\nSo that shit’s under control\n\n\n\nYou let my tyres down\n\nI’d give you anything at any time\n\nBut you let my tyres down"
