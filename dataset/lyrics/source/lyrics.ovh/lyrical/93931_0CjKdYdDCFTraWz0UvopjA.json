I got Babe Ruth gripped in my hands\n\n\n\nPu-pu-pull up in that parkin' lot, ain’t nobody scared shit (You know it)\n\nBitch I been to hell and back, and momma didn't raise no bitch\n\nShe raised a hellion from the other side (You know it)\n\nOther side, she raised a crazy motherfucker right (Creek Squad)\n\n\n\nRiver, river, river rat, shotgun in the tinted glass\n\nLicense so expired I'm identified by all my tats\n\nCreeker to the grave, lock that mug and then go weld it shut\n\nBury me on Ghost Ranch with my middle fingers pointed up\n\n\n\n5150, red barn with all the roosters dog\n\nWhite church on the corner, Jaybirds been closed for a decade prolly\n\nBl-black marks on the pavement, street lights buzzin' and they barely work\n\nHills have eyes on these parts son, best make sure you just passin' through\n\nWhen the sun goes down in a one horse town there's a .45 loaded and a dog let out\n\nWith a pissed off daddy and a crazy old man and a motherfuckin' thief and a white crackhead\n\nSo I do my shit, I lock my gate, I load my guns, I clean my plate, in the pitch black I sit and wait\n\nDon't come up missin’ on 300 acres\n\n\n\nPu-pu-pull up in that parkin’ lot, ain't nobody scared shit (You know it)\n\nBitch I been to hell and back, and momma didn’t raise no bitch\n\nShe raised a hellion from the other side (You know it)\n\nOther side, she raised a crazy motherfucker right (Creek Squad)\n\n\n\nRiver, river, river rat, shotgun in the tinted glass\n\nLicense so expired I'm identified by all my tats\n\nCreeker to the grave, lock that mug and then go weld it shut\n\nBury me on Ghost Ranch with my middle fingers pointed up"
