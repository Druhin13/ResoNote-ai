  "lyrics": "Sure is hard to remember\r\nLife before you walked in the picture\r\nI was a sad Mona Lisa with a crooked frame\r\nStanding on my platform, waiting for my train\r\nI was messed up, wondering, broke down, stumbling\n\nRunning for my life\n\nWas heartbroke, hard up, a long string of bad luck\n\nSearching with no end in sight\n\n\n\nBefore you called me baby\n\nBefore you looked me in the eyes\n\nI had nothing left to save me\n\nBefore you called me, before you called me\n\nBefore you called me baby\n\n\n\nIt's like the walls soaked down and the lights turned on\n\nAnd the band started playing a different song\n\nLike I was baptized by the fire in your kiss\n\nNo I've never, ever felt like this\n\n\n\nBefore you called me baby\n\nBefore you looked me in the eyes\n\nI had nothing left to save me\n\nBefore you called me, before you called me\n\nBefore you called me baby\n\nBefore you called me baby\n\n\n\nI was drowning, wasted, lost and jaded\n\nHanging by a thread\n\nI was sinking, shook up, and almost gave up\n\nOn this lonely heart in my chest\n\n\n\nBefore you called me baby\n\nBefore you looked me in the eyes\n\nI had nothing left to save me\n\nBefore you called me, before you called me\n\nBefore you called me baby, before you called me baby\n\nBefore you called me baby, baby, baby, baby"
