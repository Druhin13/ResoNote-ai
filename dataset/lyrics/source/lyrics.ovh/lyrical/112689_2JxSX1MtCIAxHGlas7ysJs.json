  "lyrics": "I hate you for what you did\r\nand I miss you like a little kid\r\nI faked it every time but that's alright\r\nI can hardly feel anything\r\nI hardly feel anything at all\n\nYou gave me fifteen hundred\n\nto see your hypnotherapist\n\nI only went one time\n\nyou let it slide\n\nfell on hard times a year ago\n\nwas hoping you would let it go and you did\n\n\n\nI have emotional motion sickness\n\nsomebody roll the windows down\n\nThere are no words in the English language\n\nI could scream to drown you out\n\n\n\nI'm on the outside looking through\n\nYou're throwing rocks around your room\n\nand while you're bleeding on your back in the glass\n\nI'll be glad that I made it out\n\nand sorry that it all went down like it did\n\n\n\nI have emotional motion sickness\n\nsomebody roll the windows down\n\nThere are no words in the English language\n\nI could scream to drown you out\n\n\n\nAnd why do you sing with an English accent\n\nI guess it's too late to change it now\n\nYou know I'm never gonna let you have it\n\nbut I will try to drown you out\n\n\n\nYou said when you met me you were bored\n\nYou said when you met me you were bored\n\nAnd you you were in a band when I was born\n\n\n\nI have emotional motion sickness\n\nI try to stay clean and live without\n\nand I want to know what would happen\n\nIf I surrender to the sound\n\n\n\nSurrender to the sound"
