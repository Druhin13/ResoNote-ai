  "lyrics": "Men walkin' 'long the railroad tracks\r\nGoin' someplace there's no goin' back\r\nHighway patrol choppers comin' up over the bridge\r\nHot soup on a campfire under the bridge\r\nShelter line stretchin' 'round the corner\r\nWelcome to the new world order\n\nFamilies sleepin' in their cars in the Southwest\n\nNo home no job no peace no rest \n\nThe highway is alive tonight\n\nBut nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes\n\nI'm sittin' down here in the campfire light\n\nSearchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad\n\n\n\nHe pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag\n\nPreacher lights up a butt and takes a drag\n\nWaitin' for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last\n\nIn a cardboard box 'neath the underpass\n\nGot a one-way ticket to the promised land\n\nYou got a hole in your belly and gun in your hand\n\nSleepin' on a pillow of solid rock\n\nBathin' in the city aqueduct\n\n\n\nThe highway is alive tonight\n\nWhere it's headed everybody knows\n\nI'm sittin' down here in the campfire light\n\nWaitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad\n\n\n\nNow Tom said \"Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy\n\nWherever a hungry newborn baby cries\n\nWhere there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air\n\nLook for me mom I'll be there\n\nWherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand\n\nOr a decent job or a helpin' hand\n\nWherever somebody's strugglin' to be free\n\nLook in their eyes Mom you'll see me.\"\n\n\n\nWell the highway is alive tonight\n\nBut nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes\n\nI'm sittin' down here in the campfire light\n\nWith the ghost of old Tom Joad"
