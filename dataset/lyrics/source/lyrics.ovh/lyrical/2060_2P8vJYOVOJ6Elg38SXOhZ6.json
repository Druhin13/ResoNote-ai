  "lyrics": "Don't worry if you don't know what to do\r\nI've spent a little time in worried shoes\r\nI wore them out through walking\r\nIt wasn't any use\r\nDon't worry if you don't know what to do\n\nDon't give up if you just can't get away\n\nDon't listen to the bitter things they say\n\nPut those thoughts behind you\n\nTomorrow's a new day\n\nDon't give up if you just can't get away\n\n\n\nLife hurts\n\nAnd love will burn\n\nDon't we wish it weren't that way\n\nAnd if it\n\nFalls to bits\n\nYou should fix it\n\nDon't throw it away\n\n\n\nDon't let your heart get hardened into stone\n\nOr lose yourself in looking at your phone\n\nSo many so-called friends\n\nAnd still you feel alone\n\nYou should spend more time with the do's than with the don'ts\n\n\n\nLife hurts\n\nAnd love will burn\n\nDon't we wish it weren't that way\n\nWhen you\n\nCan't pull through\n\nI will help you\n\nI won't push you away\n\n\n\nDon't worry if you don't know what to do\n\nDon't worry if you don't know what to do\n\nDon't worry if you don't know what to do\n\nDon't worry if you don't know what to do\n\nI don't know what I'm doing\n\nNo-one has a clue\n\nBut you'll figure it out\n\nAnd I might too"
