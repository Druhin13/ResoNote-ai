  "lyrics": "There's a final curtain\r\nthere's the dotted line\r\nNo more celebration\r\nno rum no brandy no sparkling wine\r\nthe bad news has arrived\r\nit's closing time\n\n\n\nPut on all your armor\n\nmarch yourself in line\n\nswallow all your feelings\n\n'cause it's coming down to hit tonight\n\nthe bad news has arrived\n\nit's closing time\n\n\n\nHide your sons and daughters keep their fragile minds\n\nlet them read the papers\n\nbut cover up the bold headlines\n\nthe bad news has arrived\n\nthe bad news has arrived\n\n\n\nthe bad news has arrived\n\nit's closing time"
