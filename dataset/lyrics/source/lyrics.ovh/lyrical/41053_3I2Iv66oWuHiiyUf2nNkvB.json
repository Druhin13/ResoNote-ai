  "lyrics": "In the dark again\r\nThat borders to the old imagination\r\nThe inside of my soul once again lost my friend\r\nSo ashamed of what I've done\r\nAll alone again\n\nWith nothing but the silent voices screaming\n\nThe dark side of my heart\n\nOnce again there, my friend\n\nAll my fears are torn apart\n\n\n\nTalk to me\n\nCause the shadows won't stop haunting me\n\nTalk to me\n\nStay by my side to the bitter end\n\n\n\nWhat if we fade like the midnight sun\n\nIn the last rays of darkness a journey begun\n\nWhat if we fall like the April rain\n\nWhen the last day of sunlight swept the pain away\n\n\n\nReaching in again\n\nTo the void that I so carefully protected\n\nImaginary friends\n\nOut of reach, safe from harm\n\n\n\nTalk to me\n\nCause the shadows won't stop haunting me\n\nTalk to me\n\nStay by the side to the bitter end\n\n\n\nWhat if we fade like the midnight sun\n\nIn the last rays of darkness a journey begun\n\nWhat if we fall like the April rain\n\nWhen the last day of sunlight swept the pain away\n\n\n\nTalk to me\n\nCause the shadows won't stop haunting me\n\nTalk to me\n\nStay by the side to the bitter end\n\n\n\nWhat if we fade like the midnight sun\n\nIn the last rays of darkness a journey begun\n\nWhat if we fall like the April rain\n\nWhen the last day of sunlight swept the pain away\n\n\n\nWhat if we fade like the midnight sun\n\nIn the last rays of darkness a journey begun\n\nWhat if we fall like the April rain\n\nWhen the last day of sunlight swept the pain away"
