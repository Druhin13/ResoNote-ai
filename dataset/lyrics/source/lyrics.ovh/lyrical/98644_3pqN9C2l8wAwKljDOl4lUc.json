  "lyrics": "Now I'm a sucker\r\nI'm a sinner\r\nThree times a loser\r\nA fool who can't buy you a ring\r\nYou're a lady\r\nA Saint\n\nYou're three times I ain't\n\nYou're my bonafide double wide queen\n\n\n\nI don't care the bills in the mailbox\n\nI don't care for your dad on the phone\n\nIt's you and me in my chair\n\nCovered up in your hair\n\nIt feels pretty good being poor\n\n\n\nThere's cracks in the ceiling\n\nAnd I love the feeling of watching you stuck in a dream\n\nAnd you let out a smile\n\nAnd I think for a while\n\nWhen you're sleeping\n\nYou're dreaming of me\n\n\n\nI don't care the bills in the mailbox\n\nYou don't care for the cars on the lawn\n\nIt's you and me in my bed\n\nWaking up to this nest\n\nAnd it feels pretty good being poor\n\n\n\nI don't care the bills in the mailbox\n\nI don't care for your dad on the phone\n\nIt's you and me in my chair\n\nCovered up in your hair\n\nAnd it feels pretty good being poor\n\n\n\nI know we ain't got much\n\nBut we're so rich in love\n\nAnd it feels pretty good being poor"
