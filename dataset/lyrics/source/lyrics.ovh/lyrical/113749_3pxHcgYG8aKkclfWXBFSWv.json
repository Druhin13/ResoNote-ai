  "lyrics": "Uh, what you need girl? I need a hot boy\r\nSix foot with six figures and a big toy\r\nHeard he moving weight down south to Chicago, Illinois\r\nAnd he need a college girl to account so I employ\r\nCause I’m a 5 star chick doing 5 star tricks\r\nGive him gifts all the time, I love his 5 star-\n\nWant a man with big, big bucks, money longer than my weave\n\nMy hair cost a lot, I’ma need a couple g’s\n\nNot a PlayStation, so do not play with me\n\n'Cause I will black up a nigga who don’t gain with me\n\nSee I’ma rider but nah I ain’t a die\n\n'Cause I wouldn’t take a bullet for a nigga, that’s a lie\n\nAnd that’s word to my mother, she the Filipino queen\n\nAnd she hella high maintenance, I’ma get her what she need\n\nThat’s some bling, that’s some rings, man that’s all on me\n\nClear her closet out and take her on a shopping spree\n\n\n\nThat's right\n\nIcy"
