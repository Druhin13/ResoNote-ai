Them bitches ain't want it then?\n\nAw, you the kind of guy to hide behind some other men\n\nOoh, got some muscle now, look at you all acting grown\n\nWe both know when you're alone, you're a bitch down to the bone\n\n\n\nHeard my enemies applause when I got knocked\n\nThey was hoping for my spot up at the top\n\nYeah I know they couldn't carry that wealth\n\nI'll sit back and let em bury theyself, here's a shovel\n\nI was climbing, they was praying I would drop\n\nHeard my enemies applause when I got knocked\n\nIf you're waiting on my fall then hold your breath\n\nI'll sit back and let you bury yourself, here's a shovel\n\n\n\nI'd rather starve with the ones I love than to eat\n\nWith the ones I don't, and I won't, I refuse\n\nI pursue success not at the cost of the crew\n\nMoney can't buy love, life, loyalty, and truth\n\nI heard they talking out the side of they neck\n\nDead ass, I'm bout to teach em bout respect (They gone learn it)\n\nIt ain't something that you get, ya gotta earn it (And I earned it)\n\nAnd you can't cross this bridge once you burn it, uh-uh\n\nI'm on the other side and mi casa sippin casamigo\n\nLife's been Tarantino betrayed by Al Pacino\n\nNeighborhood hero, better let go of your ego\n\nX's on your back as soon as you get them zeroes\n\n\n\nHeard my enemies applause when I got knocked\n\nThey was hoping for my spot up at the top\n\nYeah I know they couldn't carry that wealth\n\nI'll sit back and let em bury theyself, here's a shovel\n\nI was climbing, they was praying I would drop\n\nHeard my enemies applause when I got knocked\n\nIf you're waiting on my fall then hold your breath\n\nI'll sit back and let you bury yourself, here's a shovel\n\n\n\nNo Thanksgivin', I'm on the boat with immigrant women\n\nLike my rock Plymouth because you I was cookin' the skillet\n\nA Nashville in the villain a smack dealer\n\nOn my son and let's jack one of these niggas me and J be silly\n\nI hope they forgive me, plugs in this song\n\nTold me call when I get it, but if I stick 'em up\n\nAnd call em saying come and get me, I hope God forgive me\n\nLord if I flip it twenty times I pay back every penny\n\nBut why should I when I see how they look at me with envy\n\nI went from workin' to a boss and you didn't, I get it\n\nPillow talkin', tryna see me fell\n\nSay I never blow 'cause I keep on goin' to jail\n\nIf so then no worries\n\n\n\nHeard my enemies applause when I got knocked\n\nThey was hoping for my spot up at the top\n\nYeah I know they couldn't carry that wealth\n\nI'll sit back and let em bury theyself, here's a shovel\n\nI was climbing, they was praying I would drop\n\nHeard my enemies applause when I got knocked\n\nIf you're waiting on my fall then hold your breath\n\nI'll sit back and let you bury yourself, here's a shovel"
