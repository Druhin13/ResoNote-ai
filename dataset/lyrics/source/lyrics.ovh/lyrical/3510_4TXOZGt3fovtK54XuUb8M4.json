  "lyrics": "Dancing through a hurricane\r\nSoaked in technicolor rain\r\nTime is melting in my brain\r\nPaint the roses black as night\r\nSwimming with the satellites\r\nNever wanna know, never wanna let go\n\n\n\nNo, don't wake me yet, don't give it away\n\nHold my breath, I just wanna stay and\n\n\n\nLose myself tonight\n\nI'm drifting away through the flashing lights\n\nI just wanna stay out here alone, I can dance on my own\n\nAnd I can't wait no more, I'm drifting away\n\nWhat you waiting for?\n\nI just wanna stay out here alone, we can dance on our own\n\n\n\nTake me where the stars run free\n\nSpin me through the galaxy\n\nHold me in the flow, never wanna let go\n\n\n\nNo, don't wake me yet, don't give it away\n\nHold my breath, I just wanna stay and see what's next\n\nMeet me halfway, hold our breath\n\n\n\nLose myself tonight\n\nI'm drifting away through the flashing lights\n\nI just wanna stay out here alone, I can dance on my own\n\nAnd I can't wait no more, I'm drifting away\n\nWhat you waiting for?\n\nI just wanna stay out here alone, we can dance on our own\n\n\n\nGive me just one reason why we can't believe our eyes\n\nRunning with the season 'till it makes us realize\n\nWe got it all, we got it all for us\n\nI can't wait to see the sun arriving with the rain\n\nTake my hand, we're diving into passionate terrain\n\nWe got it all, we got it all for us\n\n\n\nLose myself tonight (lose myself)\n\nI'm drifting away through the flashing lights\n\nI just wanna stay out here alone, I can dance on my own\n\nI can't wait no more (wait no more), I'm drifting away\n\nWhat you waiting for?\n\nI just wanna stay out here alone, we can dance on our own"
