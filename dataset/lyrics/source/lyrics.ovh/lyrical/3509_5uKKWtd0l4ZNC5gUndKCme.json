  "lyrics": "In the flicker of a bright light\r\nI was falling out of line\r\nI kept running into gunfights\r\nTry to face down with my hands tied\r\nI put all my weight on my back\r\nHeavy heart, carry on now\n\nJust like I run from my past\n\nHeavy heart, carry on now\n\n\n\nBut then you came along\n\nSave me from my wrongs\n\nOpen up my eyes\n\nWe're dancing to our favorite Stevie song\n\nArithmetic symmetry\n\nYour my epiphany\n\nSo if ever you're in doubt\n\nJust know that you are\n\n\n\nMaking me feel (making me feel)\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind (behind)\n\nI know I'm faking, might make it my way (my way)\n\nI'm counting stripes until the blessing is real (is real)\n\n\n\nJust know that you are\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nJust know that you are\n\nMake-making me feel, feel, feel\n\nMake-making me feel, feel, feel\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nMake-making me feel\n\n\n\nSee your reflections in my mind (in my mind)\n\nIt's like the image I've always tried to find\n\nYou tread the lights when I'm feeling blind\n\nFill up my cracks if my pit* falls down\n\n\n\nBut then you came along\n\nSave me from my wrongs\n\nOpen up my eyes\n\nWe're dancing to our favorite Stevie song\n\nArithmetic symmetry\n\nYour my epiphany\n\nSo if ever you're in doubt\n\nJust know that you are\n\n\n\nMaking me feel (making me feel)\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind (behind)\n\nI know I'm faking, might make it my way (my way)\n\nI'm counting stripes until the blessing is real (is real)\n\n\n\nJust know that you are\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nLike I am 5 steps behind\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nJust know that you are\n\nMake-making me feel, feel, feel\n\nMake-making me feel, feel, feel\n\nMake-making me feel\n\nMake-making me feel"
