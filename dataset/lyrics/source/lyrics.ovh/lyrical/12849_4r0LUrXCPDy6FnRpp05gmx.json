  "lyrics": "You have my gun\r\nYou have my life in your hands\r\nTake care of me\r\nDon't let me fall into a dream\r\nThink I'm in over my head\n\nFell in love with someone who doesn't love me\n\nTried to win her back instead\n\nI pushed her out and then I fell asleep\n\n\n\nHold me once more\n\nAs my breath slips away\n\nWhat an awful world\n\nPeople change and you never think you'd see the day\n\n\n\nI got over it instead\n\nOf being shy and letting life slip away\n\nWhat goes on inside her head?\n\nEvery time I think that myself chips away"
