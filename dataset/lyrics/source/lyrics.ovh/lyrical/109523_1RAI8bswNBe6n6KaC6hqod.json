(Spoil my night)\n\nFeelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time\n\n\n\nYeah, when I walk up in a party, they all act like they know me\n\nThen I spotted lil' mama through the wall of jabronis (Ooh)\n\nPoint her out so I can bag her if they just bring her to me (bring her to me)\n\nI ain't even see the face, but she got beautiful boobies (Wow)\n\nAnd she see those diamonds in my teeth (In my teeth)\n\nI see her smilin' back at me (Back at me)\n\nI think she rock with me like Jumanji (Jumanji)\n\nIt's about time, Postmate Plan B\n\nNow she whippin' out her phone and I know (And I know)\n\nDamn, how many videos you gon' post?\n\nEverybody on the 'Gram gonna know\n\nMy girl at home now my line about to blow (Yeah)\n\nI know what I'm doin' ain't right\n\nBut ain't no need to spoil my night, no need, no need\n\n\n\nSpoil my night, spoil my night\n\nSpoil my night (My night)\n\nSpoil my night, spoil my night\n\nI don't have much to say, I'll be out front\n\nWon't you come spoil my night? (Spoil my night)\n\nFeelin's come into play and I'm thinkin' this happens every time (Yeah)\n\n\n\nSpoil my night, spoil my night\n\nSpoil my night, spoil my night\n\nSpoil my night, spoil my night"
