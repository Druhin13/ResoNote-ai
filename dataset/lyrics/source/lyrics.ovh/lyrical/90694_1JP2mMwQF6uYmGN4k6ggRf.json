  "lyrics": "I started reeking of the people I was with\r\nI have no secret, I was freaking out a bit\r\nI took a chopper 'cause I grew up with a lot of changes\r\nI am alone a lot, I see this as my weakness\r\nI am embarrassed of my solo, I don't know why\r\nI don't want people to know how much time I spend alone\n\nTime I spend alone, time I spend alone, time I spend alone\n\n\n\nWhen I take you on, I try\n\nWhen I take you on, I try\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on, I try\n\n\n\nI put up cinderblocks to take away the pain\n\nI separated from society today\n\nI don't get close to anybody but my feelings\n\nI cannot think when I am reeling\n\nI think of people that I used to see who don't like me\n\nI don't want people to know how much time I spend alone\n\nTime I spend alone, time I spend alone, time I spend alone\n\n\n\nWhen I take you on, I try\n\nWhen I take you on, I try\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on, I try\n\n\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on\n\nWhen I take you on"
