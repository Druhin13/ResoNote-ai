  "lyrics": "I've always been fascinated with the weather\r\nSometimes I feel like I'm just going too fast\r\nAnd I got to slow down\r\n'Cause it might not last\r\nSometimes I feel like I'm just going too fast\n\nBut I got to slow down\n\n'Cause it might not last\n\n\n\nWe can use whether or not to mean regardless; I don't care. So I'm going to bed now, whether or not you're coming with me\n\n\n\nHello, this message is for Mike. Your pair of mackies have been available for pickup. If you wanna trash them, we could do that or if you wanna come and pick them up we can do that as well. The sooner the better"
