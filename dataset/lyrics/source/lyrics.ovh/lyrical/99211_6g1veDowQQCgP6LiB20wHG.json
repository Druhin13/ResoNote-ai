  "lyrics": "Staring through a broken window\r\nLooking at the snow covered streets below\r\nWe don't have to stop right now\r\nIt only hurts when the night runs out\r\nYou said you're tired and you wanted to go home\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nNever really happy, just quiet and polite\n\nSurrounded and lonely at the same time\n\n\n\nDon't you wish it was Friday forever\n\nDon't you wish the sun never came up\n\nDon't you miss being day drunk together\n\nI'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck\n\nDon't you wish it was Friday forever\n\nDon't you wish the sun never came up\n\nDon't you miss being day drunk together\n\nI'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck\n\n\n\nSlow down, take a moment with me\n\nGot no where to go and I've got no one to be\n\nDo you remember how we felt when we were all together\n\nOnly ones left awake in the world\n\nCounting the stars\n\n\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nNever really happy, just quiet and polite\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nSurrounded and lonely at the same time\n\n\n\nDon't you wish it was Friday forever\n\nDon't you wish the sun never came up\n\nDon't you miss being day drunk together\n\nI'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck\n\nDon't you wish it was Friday forever\n\nDon't you wish the sun never came up\n\nDon't you miss being day drunk together\n\nI'd still be waiting if you ever get stuck\n\n\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\n\n\nIs this what the clouds feel like?\n\nNever really happy, just quiet and polite\n\nSurrounded and lonely at the same time"
