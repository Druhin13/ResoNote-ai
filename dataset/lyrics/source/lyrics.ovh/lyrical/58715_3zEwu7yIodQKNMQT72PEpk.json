  "lyrics": "Savoy, the home of sweet romance,\rSavoy, it wins you with a glance,\rSavoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.\rYour old form just like a clinging vine,\rYour lips so warm and sweet as wine,\rYour cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.\rHow my heart is singing,\rWhile the band is swinging,\rI'm never tired of romping,\rAnd stomping with you at the Savoy.\rWhat joy - a perfect holiday,\rSavoy, where we can glide and sway,\rSavoy, let me stomp away with you;\rThe home of sweet romance,\rIt wins you at a glance,\rGives happy feet a chance to dance.\rJust like a clinging vine,\rSo soft and sweet as wine,\rSo soft and close to mine, divine.\rHow my heart is singing,\rWhile the band is swinging,\rI'm never, never, never tired of romping,\rAnd stomping with you at the Savoy.\rWhat joy - a perfect holiday,\rSavoy, where we can glide and sway,\rSavoy, let me stomp away with you;"
