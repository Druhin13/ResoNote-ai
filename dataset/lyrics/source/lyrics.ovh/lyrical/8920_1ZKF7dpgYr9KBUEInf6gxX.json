  "lyrics": "I went walking to clear my head of the buzzing\r\nI went stumbling past your car\r\nThen all the bad blood down in my bones came a-rushing\r\nSinging who's gonna love you when she's gone?\r\nCause it took such a heavy light just to find you in the first place\n\nThrough all that rain and remaining fog\n\n\n\nBut if you're thinking you might wanna stay with me\n\nI don't wanna go on my own\n\nLord I worry when I get old I'll be lonesome\n\nChasing all the umbrellas in London\n\nEvery footstep in Angel Station\n\nFor even the scent of her perfume again\n\nWatching detectives chase the one that got away\n\nThe one that got away\n\n\n\nWho would be the heart she'd hold on after mine\n\nI bet he's a fine upstanding man\n\n\n\nCause it took such a heavy light just to find you in the first place\n\nBut \"do what you love\" I once heard you say\n\n\n\nBut if you're thinking you might wanna stay with me\n\nI don't wanna go on my own\n\nLord I worry when I get old I'll be lonesome\n\nChasing all the umbrellas in London\n\nEvery footstep in Angel Station\n\nFor even the scent of her perfume again\n\nWatching detectives chase the one that got away\n\nThe one that got away\n\n\n\nI remember how we danced through the towns on the Thames\n\nFor one little night I felt like I could be made new again\n\nAnd you stayed here with me while I lost nearly everything\n\nBut \"what do you really love?\" I heard you say\n\n\n\nBut if you're thinking you might wanna stay with me\n\nI don't wanna go on my own\n\nLord I worry when I get old I'll be lonesome\n\nChasing all the umbrellas in London\n\nEvery footstep in Angel Station\n\nFor even the scent of her perfume again\n\nWatching detectives chase the one that got away\n\nThe one that got away\n\nThe one that got away\n\n\n\nHang on Watson, hang on Watson\n\n(I don't want to go on my own)"
