  "lyrics": "When I dare close my eyes\r\nI feel the vibrant morning rise\r\nOn the shores of that dear and secret island\r\nI've waited for to long\r\nTo join you where true loves belongs\r\nLet's embark on a journey back to our land\n\nLeave the world behind this once in a lifetime\n\nOur compass will reveal the place where \"us\" is real\n\nSailing the sea where our legend will live\n\nAll our stories and memories are mine to believe\n\nWalking there, hand in hand\n\nAs kings of our own land\n\nOur return to Lemuria\n\nUntil the day has come I wish to stay with you alone\n\nBut I dread that you'll leave without a warning\n\nI hear your words my dear inside I share this deepest fear\n\nBut we know there will dawn a darker morning\n\nLeave the world behind this once in a lifetime\n\nOur compass will reveal the place where \"us\" is real\n\nSailing the sea where our legend will live\n\nAll our stories and memories are mine to believe\n\nWalking there, hand in hand\n\nAs kings of our own land\n\nOur return to Lemuria\n\nLeave the world behind this once in a lifetime\n\nOur compass will reveal the place where \"us\" is real\n\nSailing the sea where our legend will live\n\nAll our stories and memories are mine to believe\n\nWalking there, hand in hand\n\nAs kings of our own land\n\nOur return to Lemuria\n\nHolding you in my heart\n\nAs we sail apart\n\nEnd the dream called Lemuria"
