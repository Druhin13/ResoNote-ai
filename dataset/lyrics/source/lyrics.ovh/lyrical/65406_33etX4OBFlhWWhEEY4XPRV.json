The name of this song is \"Penguin in Bondage,\" an' it's a song that, uh, deals with the possible variations on a basic theme which is . . . well, you understand what the basic theme is. And then the variations include, uh, manoeuvres that might be executed with the aid of, uh, extra-terrestrial gratification and devices which might or might not be supplied in a local department store or perhaps a drugstore but at very least in one of those fancy new shops that they advertise in the back-pages of the free press. This song suggests to the suggestible listener that the ordinary procedure, uh, that I'm circumlocuting at this present time in order to get this text on television, is that, uh, if you wanna do something other than what you thought you were gonna do when you first took your clothes off and you just happened to have some DEVICES around . . . then it's, it's not only okay to get into the PARAPHERNALIA of it all but . . . hey! What did he say? Ready?\r\nShe's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy\r\nOh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh . . .\r\nRennenhenninnahenninnenninahennn\r\nWay over on the wet side\n\nOf the bed (Knirps for moisture)\n\n\n\nJust like the mighty Penguin\n\nFlappin' her eight ounce wings\n\n(The Penguin Flap)\n\n\n\nLord, you know it's all over\n\nIf she come atcha on the strut & wrap 'em all around yer head\n\nFlappin' her eight ounce wings, flappinumm\n\n\n\nShe's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy\n\n\n\nShake up the pale-dry\n\nGinger ale\n\n\n\nTremblin' like a Penguin\n\nWhen the battery fail\n\n\n\nLord, you must be havin' her jumpin' through a hoopa real fire\n\nWith some Kleenex wrapped around a coat-hang wire\n\n\n\nShe's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy\n\nOh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh . . .\n\nRennenhenninnahenninneninahenn\n\nHowlin' over to some\n\nAntarcticulated moon\n\n\n\nIn the frostbite nite\n\nWith her flaps gone white\n\nShriekin' as she spot the hoop across the room\n\n(Everytime she sees the hoop)\n\n\n\nYou know it must be a Penguin bound down\n\nIf you hear that terrible screamin' and there ain't no other\n\nBirds around\n\n\n\nShe's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy\n\nOh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh . . .\n\nShe's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy\n\nOh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh . . .\n\nRennenhenninnahenninneninahennnn\n\nAw, you must be careful\n\nNot to leave her straps\n\nTOO LOOSE\n\n\n\n'Cause she just might box yer dog\n\nShe just might box yer doggie\n\nAn' leave you a dried-up dog biscuit . . ."
