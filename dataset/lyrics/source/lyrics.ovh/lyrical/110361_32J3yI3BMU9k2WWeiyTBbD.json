(No!)\n\nWe're here to fight! (Yeah!) We're here to stay!\n\n\n\n3\n\nNever backing down\n\n2\n\nOur time is now\n\n1\n\nCan you hear the sound of a million voices screaming out?\n\n\n\nSee the tables turn\n\nFeel the fire burn\n\nOnce we get started there's no stopping us\n\nYeah we run this town\n\nWe're not slowing down\n\nWe came to change the game so get out the way (watch out!)\n\n\n\nWhen the pressure's on\n\nYou gonna find out what we're all about\n\nWhen it's said and done\n\nYou'll never forget we run this town\n\n\n\nWatch out!\n\nWe're never backing down\n\nOh\n\nWatch out!\n\nCan you hear our voices screaming out?\n\n\n\nSee the tables turn\n\nFeel the fire burn\n\nOnce we get started there's no stopping us\n\nYeah we run this town\n\nWe're not slowing down\n\nWe came to change the game so get out the way (watch out!)\n\n\n\nSee the tables turn\n\nFeel the fire burn\n\nOnce we get started there's no stopping us\n\nYeah we run this town\n\nWe're not slowing down\n\nWe came to change the game so get out the way (watch out!)"
