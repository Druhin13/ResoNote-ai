  "lyrics": "How does a sparrow know more than I?\r\nWhen it's mother is gone, it learns how to fly\r\nWith no direction, its wings in the wind\r\nHow does a bird know more than I?\r\nHow does the winter know to hold on\n\nWhen it's scared of it's shadow and flowers are gone?\n\nThe leaves all lay sleepin', prayin' to hear spring-time songs\n\nHow does the winter know to hold on?\n\n\n\nNobody told me what I should do\n\nWhen the world starts to rumble and shake under you\n\nHow does an orphan find its way home?\n\nReach out with no hand to hold\n\nHow do I make it alone?\n\n\n\nWhat keeps a river runnin' that way?\n\nIs it slave to the ocean, a wild runaway?\n\nDoes it shed a tear, all who have drowned in its wake?\n\nWhat keeps a river runnin' that way?\n\n\n\nNobody told me what I should do\n\nWhen the world starts to rumble and shake under you\n\nHow does an orphan find its way home?\n\nReach out with no hand to hold\n\nHow do I make it alone?\n\n\n\nNobody told me what I should do\n\nWhen the world starts to rumble and shake under you\n\nHow does an orphan find its way home?\n\nAnd I reach out with no hand to hold\n\nHow do I make it alone?\n\n\n\nHow does a sparrow know more than I?\n\nWhen it's mother is gone, it learns how to fly"
