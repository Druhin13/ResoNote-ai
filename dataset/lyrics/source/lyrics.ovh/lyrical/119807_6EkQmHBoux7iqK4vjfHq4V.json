  "lyrics": "It's been a minute since we connected\r\nI got the message, you don't feel like that\r\nSo why can't you leave it the way we left it\r\nInstead of reminiscin' 'bout the past\r\nI showed you things I know you liked\r\nAnd I thought that I could change your mind\n\nAnd I almost did now didn't I\n\nAnd I almost did now don't lie\n\n\n\nDo you think about me?\n\nAnd the way it could be\n\nI'll make it easy\n\nYou tell me, should I stay or go?\n\n'Cause I need to know\n\nDo you think about us?\n\nCould I give you enough\n\nI'll make it easy\n\nYou tell me, should I stay or go?\n\n'Cause I need to know\n\n\n\nJust for a second, answer the question\n\nCan we address the things you do and say\n\nYou took the first flight, you were so recklessly in it\n\nNow you're tryna say it was never that way\n\n\n\nI showed you things I know you liked\n\nAnd I thought that I could change your mind\n\nAnd I almost did now didn't I\n\nAnd I almost did now don't lie\n\nDo you think about me?\n\nAnd the way it could be\n\nI'll make it easy\n\nYou tell me, should I stay or go?\n\n'Cause I need to know\n\nDo you think about us?\n\nCould I give you enough\n\nI'll make it easy\n\nYou tell me, should I stay or go?\n\n'Cause I need to know\n\n\n\nDo you think about me?\n\nAnd the way it could be\n\nI'll make it easy\n\nYou tell me, should I stay or go?\n\n'Cause I need to know\n\nAnd do you think about us?\n\nAnd could I give you enough?\n\nI'll make it easy\n\nYou tell me, should I stay or go?\n\n'Cause I need to know"
