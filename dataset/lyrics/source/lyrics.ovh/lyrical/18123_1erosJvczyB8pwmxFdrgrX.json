  "lyrics": "We never seen a day no never held a hand no\r\nFound a way to feel the same\r\nI’ve never flown for hours to make one city hour\r\nAnd checked the weather where you were\r\nI may never leave you now\n\n‘Cause I have finally seen you now I may never leave you now\n\n‘Cause I’ve been waiting on your eyes to set in mine I go ahead and fly away\n\nDrive away in my thoughts and get to you somehow I go ahead and fly again\n\n‘Cause everything I see you already are to me\n\nOohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh\n\n\n\nThe world is raging out there\n\nThe wars are going nowhere, still I’ll just want to heal you there It might seem innocent, out of nowhere\n\nSomehow I check the weather again\n\n\n\nI may never leave you now, ‘cause I have finally seen you now\n\nI may never leave you now, ‘cause I’ve been waiting on your eyes to set in mine\n\n\n\nI go ahead and fly away, drive away in my thoughts and get to you somehow\n\nI go ahead and fly again, ‘cause everything I see you already are to me\n\n\n\nI move from a corner to stand on the water\n\nBut my are we too late? Are we late? Are we too late?\n\nOohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh"
