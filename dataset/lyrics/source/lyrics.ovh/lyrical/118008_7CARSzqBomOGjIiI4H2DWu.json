  "lyrics": "Here I am waking up, still can't sleep on your side\r\nThere's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time\r\nIf I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'll be just fine\r\nI'll be just fine\r\nSo I drown it out like I always do\n\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\nAnd I chase it down, with a shot of truth\n\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\n\n\nCleaning up today, found that old Zepplin shirt\n\nYou wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt\n\nWe're too young, too dumb, to know things like love\n\nBut I know better now (better now)\n\n\n\nSo I drown it out like I always do\n\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\nAnd I chase it down, with a shot of truth\n\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\n\n\nToo young, too dumb\n\nTo know things like love\n\nToo young, too dumb\n\n\n\nSo I drown it out like I always do\n\nDancing through our house with the ghost of you\n\nAnd I chase it down, with a shot of truth\n\nThat my feet don't dance like they did with you"
