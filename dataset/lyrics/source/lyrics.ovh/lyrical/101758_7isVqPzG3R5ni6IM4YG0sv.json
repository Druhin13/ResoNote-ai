  "lyrics": "You were running blind\r\nFollowing your feet to try\r\nAnd outrun your fate\r\nStanding in a field of clouds\r\nCerebral voices the loudest\r\nAll hollering your name\n\nIs it paradise?\n\nOnly if it blows your mind\n\nAnd then blows you away\n\nSometimes you reel\n\nSometimes you deal\n\nSometimes you have to rob and steal\n\nCall you a sinner, man\n\nOr call it second sight\n\nNow they treat 'em all the same\n\nAnd it's the the thinnest line\n\nThey hung you out by\n\nYou were holding my hands and saying\n\n\"What if I only ever took what's mine?\"\n\nI wanted to tell them that if I\n\nCould have led a different life\n\nCould have led a different life\n\nNow I\n\nNeed somebody who can ease my mind\n\nNeed somebody who can ease my mind\n\nYou know I\n\nCould have led a different life\n\nCould have led a different life\n\nPulling me aside\n\nGiving me your last advice\n\nAnd the whole house shakes\n\nSay keep it in the family, hide\n\nDon't make the mistakes that I did\n\n'Cause it'll wear your soul away\n\nAnd I would have tried\n\nIf only it was black and white\n\nBut it's bullet gray\n\nSometimes you reel\n\nSometimes you deal\n\nSometimes you have to rob and steal\n\nCall you a sinner, man\n\nCall it second sight\n\nNow they treat 'em all the same\n\nIt's the thinnest line to hang you by\n\nHolding my hands and saying\n\n\"You know I only ever took what's mine\"\n\nI wanted to tell them that if I\n\nCould have lived a different life\n\nCould have lived a different life\n\nNow I\n\nNeed somebody who can ease my mind\n\nNeed somebody who can ease my mind\n\nYou know I\n\nNeed the remedy to kill my vice\n\nNeed the valium to sleep at night\n\n(night)\n\n(night, night, night)...\n\n(night, night, night)...\n\n(night, night, night)...\n\nWhat if I only ever took what's mine?\n\nI wanted to tell them that if I\n\nCould have led a different life\n\nCould have led a different life\n\nNow I\n\nNeed somebody who can ease my mind\n\nNeed the remedy to kill my vice\n\nNeed somebody who can ease my mind"
