  "lyrics": "We ain't perfect but we're working on it\r\nYou got baggage, but I gotta have it\r\nAin't no you without of me\r\nThere ain't no such thing\r\nIt's never easy, I wouldn't want it to be\r\nI got moodswings, but you're still rocking with me\n\nYou make me laugh when I get mad and I can't stand it, no\n\n\n\nWe drive each other crazy\n\nAnd that's how I like it, baby\n\nTwo broken hearts still beating, we need this\n\n'Cause ain't no one love like we do\n\nDo you remember summer?\n\nWe tried to escape the suburbs\n\nBut we couldn't leave your covers, or each other\n\n'Cause ain't no one love like we do\n\n\n\nBoth got a past but we're getting past them\n\nGo grab a couple of duffels and your passport\n\nWe don't got a destination\n\nPick your place and let's just go\n\n\n\nWe drive each other crazy\n\nAnd that's how I like it, baby\n\nTwo broken hearts still beating, we need this\n\n'Cause ain't no one love like we do\n\nDo you remember summer?\n\nWe tried to escape the suburbs\n\nBut we couldn't leave your covers, or each other\n\n'Cause ain't no one love like we do\n\n\n\nWe drive each other crazy\n\nAnd that's how I like it, baby\n\nTwo broken hearts still beating, we need this\n\n'Cause ain't no one love like we do"
