  "lyrics": "Jane Austen in the hospital\r\nYour handwriting on the legal pad was barely legible\r\nWaiting I wonder if I could go all the way back\r\nWould any of it still scare me\r\nFor example the labrador down the street\n\nMom carried me down from off the car\n\nNeighbor scolded I'd upset him\n\nEvery time he took off, my thoughts got dark and menacing\n\n\n\nGo on Romeo, bark your head off\n\nMy last terror of ignorance is still to come\n\nCouldn't quit it, you dumb dog\n\nChasing speeding cars\n\nI heard the engine and then you lay like a good boy\n\nOn the hot summer tar\n\n\n\nThat night, the awful relief\n\nNow what are ya gonna do to me?\n\nFirst symptom of guilt then became a permanent shame\n\n\n\nAnd now I can get close enough, close enough to see you're overgrown with a look of love. (You're overgrown with a look of love.)\n\n\n\nI still dream of spiders crawling across my bed\n\nThe present, I have no place in it\n\nI still dream of being watched, but not by ---\n\nWell, I know your thoughts on the matter\n\nAnd we don't need to discuss it\n\n\n\n'Round three AM you will come to\n\nYour roommate's pissed his sheets right through\n\nYears from now you will build beautiful black flowers\n\n\n\nI came home and you directed with your hardened hand\n\nAll of your birds who have come back to dine and rest in your garden again\n\n(They've come to rest in your garden.)\n\n\n\nNow I can get close enough\n\nClose enough to see you're overgrown with a look of love\n\nYou're overgrown with a look of love\n\n\n\n(La la la la la la la)\n\n(Bark your head off\n\nBark your head off dog)"
