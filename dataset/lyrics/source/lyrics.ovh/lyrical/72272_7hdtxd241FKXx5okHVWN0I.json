  "lyrics": "Swim, the tide is coming\r\nWe spent too long watching\r\nBullet holes are rushing in\r\nNo use bailing\r\nBullet proof, they never loved you\n\nYou let too many bullets through\n\n\n\nTo be patient and awake\n\nThere are things to learn here, Kate\n\nTo forgive and to accept\n\nThings that haven't happened yet\n\n\n\nBullet proof, they never loved you\n\nYou let too many bullets through\n\n\n\nEverything we broke today\n\nNeeding breaking, anyway\n\nCan you prove to me\n\nThat you can feel anything?\n\nProve to me that you can feel\n\n\n\nBullet proof, they never loved you\n\nYou let too many bullets through"
