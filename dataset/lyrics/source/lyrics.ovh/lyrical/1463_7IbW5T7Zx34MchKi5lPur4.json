  "lyrics": "I was on path but it started to get old\r\nThought about the past and it started getting cold\r\nAnd I don't mind the rules just as long as I've been told\r\nBut living on the edge is starting to get dull\r\nAnd I don't really mind being the safe bet\r\nIt's just that my brain is always messing with my head\n\nTell me to go fast when I need to take it slow\n\nTelling me I'm good when I'm losing control\n\n\n\nI still smile while it all falls down\n\n\n\nLosing my mind\n\nFeels good sometimes\n\nAnd I'm done trying\n\nTrying to make it rhyme\n\nLiving in the memory of another woken dream\n\nLosing my mind\n\nFeels good sometimes\n\n\n\nNever been the type to go breaking the law\n\nDon't know if what I see is actually what I saw\n\nAnd I've been hearing things since the day that I was born\n\nBut Voices in my head are louder than I let on\n\nAnd I don't really mind life being so mundane\n\nBut there ain't nothing wrong with me walking in the rain\n\nAnd there ain't nothing gone but my will to hold on\n\nSo I don't wanna stop living life until it's gone\n\nI still smile while it all falls down\n\n\n\nHave another round cuz the night is young\n\nMake a toast to the rising sun\n\nCan't change the past cuz what's done is done"
