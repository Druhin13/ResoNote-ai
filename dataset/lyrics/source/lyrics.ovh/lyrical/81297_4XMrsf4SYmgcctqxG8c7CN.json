  "lyrics": "I don't know where I'm going, but I can't wait to get there,\r\nAll I know is, I'm just going\r\nI ran away from home last night, gone forever\r\nI was running for my life\r\nAnd I've heard the words of what I should be\n\nLive, Work, Die, I am the orphan of the night\n\n\n\nTake me down, I'm coming home, the road to ruins\n\nInside the pleasure dome\n\nTake me down, I'm coming home, arena of pleasures\n\n\n\nWhere I belong\n\n\n\nI'm in the eye of my rage, where no hurricane dies\n\nI'm in the eye of my rage, where the hurricane lies\n\nOh, a storm's in my eyes\n\nAnd like the beast that's in my soul, I'm the restless child\n\nAh mama, I'm running for my life\n\n\n\nI was sixteen going nowhere, will I see seventeen alive\n\nAnd I was running from the nightmare\n\nstand at the promised land with fire in my eyes\n\nI'm at the crossroad of my destiny and desire\n\nOh, God, what will I be\n\nAnd my obsession is the gasoline to feed my fire\n\nOh it's burning in me\n\n\n\nDon't waste the tears on my wasted years\n\nMama I'm outta here"
