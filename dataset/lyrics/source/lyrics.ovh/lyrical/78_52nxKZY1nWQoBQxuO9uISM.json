  "lyrics": "I waited too long to write this down\r\nThe startling sensation is fading\r\nThe sweet, sweet burn of the\r\nFirst drink of the night underaged\r\nKnowing that you're gonna get away with it\n\nYou were a good man before you knew it\n\nAnd I'm not vain enough to think that\n\nI'd have been good for you if I'd stayed\n\nIn the current of your life\n\nI was an eyelash in the shipping lanes\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm so scared about mystery\n\nI fear I smell extinction in the\n\nFolds of this novacaine age coming on\n\nI miss the smell of mystery\n\nReverb leaking outta tavern doors\n\nAnd not knowing how the sounds were made\n\n\n\nSo I left home and faked my ID\n\nI fucked every man that I wanted to be\n\nI was so stupid then\n\nWhy should mystery give its last name\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm afraid\n\nBut it's not your fault\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nHome alone tonight\n\nBaby, I'm afraid\n\nBut it's not your fault\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nHome alone tonight\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I'll see you in our old home\n\nWhere I'm always scared to go\n\nThose thirty garbage miles\n\nMaking with cigarette butts and used tires\n\nTo be poor is the anchor that makes us so sure\n\n\n\nYour sandy voice across my brow\n\nYou haven't aged a day\n\nIs it because you took a shortcut that\n\nMakes people say you're crazy\n\nIs it true\n\nYou're a time traveler, you\n\nIs it true\n\nI've seen crazy too\n\n\n\nCan it be a comfort between us\n\nBecause I never want to know for sure\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm afraid\n\nBut it's not your fault\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nHome alone tonight\n\nBaby, I'm afraid\n\nBut it's not your fault\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nHome alone tonight\n\n\n\nThe instrumental over the bridge\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I write this in a pale town\n\nWhere excitement is a yellow curb\n\nMy dream awake leaps through my window\n\nFrom the highway\n\n\n\nYou turn my head and set the brake too late\n\nIt needs to tease metric tons\n\nCrash comes (comes, comes)\n\nIt goes down my public face\n\nBehind the reservoir of collar bones\n\nForms two private lakes (lakes, lakes, lakes, lakes)\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm a fool\n\n\n\nHoping is so easy\n\nYou haven't gained a day\n\nTwo self-fulfilling prophecies\n\nWho don't even have each other\n\nNot that we would ever get away with it"
