  "lyrics": "Did you ever get the feelin' you ain't been dealt a good hand?\r\nThe odds are against you, you're a slave to the law of the land?\r\nI'm gonna gather unto me what must be mine\r\nI want it all right now, not a little at a time\r\nThinking 'bout a revolution\n\nThe first world drawin' the line\n\n\n\nWe all want what we ain’t got\n\nSome of us have and some have not\n\nEverything I've got comin' to me\n\nLife, love, money in the land of the free\n\nAll my life I've been turned out\n\nOne of these days I get the best seat in the house\n\n\n\nYou got a right to your opinion, you got a right to speak your piece\n\nYou got a right to be silent, well that ain't ever worked for me\n\nGoin' through the system'll chew you up and spit you out\n\nIn the land of confusion, that's what it's all about\n\n\n\nThinkin' 'bout the evolution\n\nHave we always been in the ground?\n\n\n\nWe all want what we ain’t got\n\nSome of us have and some have not\n\nEverything I've got comin' to me\n\nLife, love, money in the land of the free\n\nAll my life I've been turned out\n\nOne of these days I get the best seat in the house\n\n\n\nIt’s the measure of a man\n\nDoes anyone even understand?\n\n\n\nWe all want what we ain’t got\n\nSome of us have and some have not\n\nEverything I've got comin' to me\n\nLife, love, money in the land of the free\n\nAll my life I've been turned out\n\nOne of these days I get the best seat in the house\n\nBest seat in the house\n\nThe best seat in the house\n\nThe best seat in the house"
