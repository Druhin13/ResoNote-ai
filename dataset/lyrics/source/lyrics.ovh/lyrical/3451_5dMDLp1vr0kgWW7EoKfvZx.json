  "lyrics": "Next time I'll be kinder with you\r\nThere's just this habit that I have\r\nI throw my words around like fire\r\nThey catch on your good heart and your peace of mind\r\nBut next time I'll be kinder\n\nAnd if I learn to take it lighter when you\n\nTell me there's something that I lack\n\nWould that make you change your mind?\n\nWould that make it better and buy me some time?\n\n\n\nCause I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't\n\nEvery time I swear I will, you swear I won't\n\nThere's a better version of me\n\nStay for the person I'll be\n\n\n\nIf there's a next time, I'll fight harder for you\n\nWon't take for granted what we had\n\nI wake with you in mind, but I'm tired\n\nFall on different phases are all these faults of mine\n\n\n\nCause I'm damned if I'm true, and I'm damned if I'm lying\n\nEvery time you say I lose, I swear that I'm trying\n\nIf there's a better version of me\n\nWould you stay for the person I'll be?\n\n\n\nI'll be (stay)\n\nFor the person I'll be (stay)\n\n(Stay) for the person I'll be\n\nStay (stay) for the person I'll be\n\n(Stay) stay for the person I'll be\n\nStay for the person I'll be"
