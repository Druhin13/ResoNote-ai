  "lyrics": "Strawberry wine on your lips got me amazed\r\nHow 'bout you let this cowboy take you away?, take you away?\r\nGimme that wink, I'ma give it right back\r\nYou know you like it, you love it, you want some more of that\r\nYou make me smile like I did when we were radio kids\n\nCatching that countdown on Sunday, all the way to one day\n\n\n\nWhen it was\n\nDo you love me? If you do, check yes, please\n\nGirl, you know you think my tractor's sexy\n\nGot me spinning like a jukebox junkie\n\nMaking me feel like 90's country\n\nYou make me feel like 90's country\n\nShake it I dare you\n\nQueen of my double wide trailer\n\nMillion songs I could list you\n\nBut I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you\n\n\n\nYou see that water tower? Girl, we can dream on it\n\nI'ma paint your name in John Deere green on it\n\nI, I cross my heart, I ain't no walk-away Joe\n\nI'm gonna get you to the church on Cumberland Road\n\n\n\nAnd you get sweeter with time\n\nJust like that bottle of wine\n\nMight be a little dust on it but\n\nWon't it taste so fine? (Just like you)\n\n\n\nDo you love me? If you do, check yes, please\n\nGirl, you know you think my tractor's sexy\n\nI'm sold to the lady in the front seat\n\nMaking me feel like 90's country\n\nYou make me feel like 90's country\n\nShake it I dare you\n\nQueen of my double wide trailer\n\nMillion songs I could list you\n\nBut I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you\n\nYou make me feel like 90's country\n\n\n\nYou know you're beautiful, don't act like you don't\n\nAin't settling for no burger and no grape snow cone, not tonight\n\n\n\nDo you love me? If you do, check yes, please\n\nGirl, you know you think my tractor's sexy\n\nI ain't in it for your daddy's money\n\nYou make me feel like 90's country\n\nYou make me feel like 90's country\n\nShake it I dare you\n\nQueen of my double wide trailer\n\nMillion songs I could list you\n\nBut I'm just gon' shut up and kiss you\n\nBaby, don't be stupid, you know I love you\n\nBlame it all on my roots when I turned up at 90's country"
