  "lyrics": "We've all had better days\r\nDays, they fade away\r\nAll that matters is where we are now\r\nI'm a sinking stone\r\nCarrying too much alone\r\nAll that I want is to be by your side\n\n\n\nThere's so much on my mind\n\nLeaving me asking, why\n\nI am so cold\n\nMy head's just above the water\n\nAnd I wanna know who taught you\n\nJust how to live this life, you know\n\n\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nWhenever I feel low\n\nAnd when I'm so far from home\n\nAlways count my stars at night\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nWhenever I feel low\n\nAnd when I'm so far from home\n\nAlways count my stars at night\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\n\n\nAnd when the skies are grey\n\nMy demons come out to play\n\nI promise they are not here to stay\n\nWherever we go now\n\nI'm there if you fall down\n\nJust know that I will only be by your side\n\n\n\nThere's one thing on my mind\n\nYou look into my eyes, and then you know\n\n\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nWhenever I feel low\n\nAnd when I'm so far from home\n\nAlways count my stars at night\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nWhenever I feel low\n\nAnd when I'm so far from home\n\nAlways count my stars at night\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\n\n\nI'll be there when you get lonely\n\nYou have done the same for me\n\nYou can fall into my arms, fall back asleep\n\nI know that people change, and you might too\n\nI will back you through and through\n\nI believe it all happens for a reason\n\n\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nWhenever I feel low\n\nAnd when I'm so far from home\n\nAlways count my stars at night\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nWhenever I feel low\n\nAnd when I'm so far from home\n\nAlways count my stars at night\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\n\n\nYou send shivers down my spine\n\nYou send shivers down my spine"
