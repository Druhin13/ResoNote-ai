Trae & Slim Thug)\r\n[Chamillionaire:]\r\nMy life\r\nMy life, really feelin hard times\n\nLookin out my window, holdin my weapon like Malcolm X and\n\nAnd it seems I'm over-stressin, feelin like hatin is your profession\n\nAnd I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin\n\nSo I never be oversteppin boundaries bounded to my weapon\n\nWhen they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em \"I'm doin super\"\n\nI got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya\n\nHer little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future\n\nAnd legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa\n\nThis recession is so pathetic, got me feelin like I'm athletic\n\nAnd success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it\n\nWhen they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was \"I don't get it\"\n\nAnd I'm still havin trouble believin it happened the way they said it\n\nHad to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault\n\nI've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss\n\nBut I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss\n\nSo I be sleepin with one eye open and put cameras in my vault\n\nI've been thinkin and gettin deep and they tryna tell I been preachin\n\nBut I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin\n\nSo stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and\n\nIn the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent\n\nEurope to UK and Germany, travellin currently\n\nMade so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity\n\nAccustomed to hittin customs with that duffle full of currency\n\nWhen God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me... Koopa\n\n\n\n[Hook x4: Chamillionaire]\n\nI'm just livin my life, so cold\n\nIn the streets so I'm takin it slow\n\n\n\n[Trae:]\n\nUh, yeah\n\nI'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie\n\n\n\nIt a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time\n\nBut since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin fine\n\nI live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin\n\nAnd since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)\n\nI'm paralysed when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain\n\nFeelin like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain\n\nAnything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name\n\nForgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin insane\n\nMedia criticising me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well\n\nI just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga\n\nI'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster\n\nSo every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin for a gangster\n\nIt's bad enough the world we livin in all about money\n\nSince we runnin out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny\n\nI've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it\n\nI'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it\n\n\n\n[Hook x4]\n\n\n\n[Slim Thug:]\n\nLast year was a hard one but life goes on\n\nThinkin bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song\n\nAnd the list goes on, all my niggas is gone\n\nI'm tired of hearin bad news, scared to pick up my phone\n\nGot a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home\n\nJust seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong\n\nKelvo, Arborea, even my girl ShantZ\n\nI just heard word she got stabbed to death today\n\nDear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain\n\nFrom their family and their friends, please help us change\n\nStill warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank\n\nMy girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin out my drank\n\nIt's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen\n\nSeem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end\n\nI'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated\n\nYou never know when showin your love might be related, hah\n\n\n\n[Hook x4]"
