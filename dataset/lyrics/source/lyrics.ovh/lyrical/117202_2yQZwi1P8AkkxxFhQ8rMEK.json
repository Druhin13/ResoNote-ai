  "lyrics": "They said I was nothing but a troublemaker never up to no good\r\nYou were the perfect all American girl wouldn't touch me even if you could\r\nBut you was sneaking out your window everynight riding shotgun in my car\r\nWe go to the river and find us a spot and probably went a little too far\r\nJust a little too far\n\nCause I was gonna be your forever\n\nYou were gonna be my wife\n\nWe didn't know any better\n\nDidn't have a clue about life\n\nBut I was what you wanted you were what I needed\n\nAnd we could meet in between\n\nWe were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen\n\n\n\nSo you went off to college and I got a job I was working that 9 to 5\n\nDreaming of the days when you were in my arms I've never felt so alive\n\nI spent my days working, spent my nights drinking, howling at the moon\n\nScreaming for the days when you were coming back no couldn't come to soon\n\nCouldn't come to soon\n\n\n\nWhen I was gonna be your forever\n\nYou were gonna be my wife\n\nBut you went off to find better\n\nAnd I was learning all about life\n\nBut I was what you wanted and you were what I needed\n\nAnd we could meet in between\n\nWe were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen\n\n\n\nSo you came back after a long four years\n\nYour college boyfriend didn't work out\n\nSo we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now\n\nSure we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me\n\nI went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee\n\nDown on one knee\n\n\n\nAnd I said\n\nI'm gonna be your forever\n\nSo baby will you be my wife\n\nNow that we know a little better\n\nWe could have a real nice life\n\nCause I'm what you wanted and your what I need\n\nSo let's meet in between\n\nWe are gonna be the greatest love story this town has ever seen\n\nWe are gonna be the greatest love story this world has ever seen\n\nSo baby say yes to me"
