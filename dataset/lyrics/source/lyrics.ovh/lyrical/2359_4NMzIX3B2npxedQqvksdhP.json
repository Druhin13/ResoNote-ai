  "lyrics": "I was a lot younger but I was a fighter\r\nAnd now he could get me out of any jail\r\nI packed up and left, part of me waited\r\nBut I already know how lucky I am\r\nWorld softly spinning and the stars are forever\n\nAnd I remember the violence in your hazel eyes\n\nI know I should say, yeah I know I should tell her\n\nI'm sorry for everything and I hope you're all right\n\n\n\nIs the light still blinding?\n\nIs the morning sun still coming back?\n\n\n\nI was saved by the water of rivers\n\nBy the laughter of children who wish I was home\n\nBut asking the world to make it come easy\n\nDidn't work for your parents, yeah you're on your own\n\n\n\nI left in a hurry, my clothes barely buttoned\n\nAnd Travels With Charley tucked under my arm\n\nGot the road to your cell\n\nAnd your [?]\n\nI'm thinking about you wherever you are"
