  "lyrics": "Trouble in mind, I'm blue\r\nBut I won't be blue always,\r\n'cause the sun's gonna shine\r\nIn my backdoor some day.\r\nI'm all alone at midnight\n\nAnd my lamp is burnin' low\n\nAin't never had so much\n\nTrouble in my life before.\n\n\n\nTrouble in mind, that's true\n\nI have almost lost my mind,\n\nLife ain't worth livin,\n\nSometimes I feel like dyin'.\n\n\n\nGoin' down to the river\n\n\n\nGonna take my ol' rockin' chair\n\nAnd if the blues don't leave me\n\nI'll rock away from there.\n\n\n\nYou been a hard-hearted mama\n\nGreat god! you been unkind\n\nGonna be a cold, cold papa\n\nCause you to lose your mind.\n\n\n\nI'm gonna lay my head down\n\nOn some lonesome railroad line\n\nAnd let the two nineteen\n\nPacify my mind.\n\n\n\nWell it's trouble, oh trouble\n\nTrouble on my worried mind,\n\nWhen you see me laughin'\n\nI'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'."
