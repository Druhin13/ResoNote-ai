  "lyrics": "Heard you own a new car and a big home (big home)\r\nOwning everything but your mistakes\r\nFor what, for what, for what?\r\nShowing off your art and all your new gold (new gold)\r\nActing like Usain Bolt\r\nSo what, so what, so what?\n\n\n\nBaby, tell me where your friends now?\n\nBaby, that's you on the way down\n\nYou know I be there to catch ya\n\n'Cause I'm faded with my arms out\n\nBut you won't remember when I call on you when I break\n\n\n\nHow can you love me? How can you love me?\n\nHow can you love me?\n\nHow can you love me? How can you love me?\n\nHow can you love me when you don't have a heart?\n\nWhen you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart\n\nWhen you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart\n\n\n\nStanding in the foyer in the silence (silence)\n\nPenthouse feel like an asylum\n\nAlone, alone, alone\n\nRiding off of love without a license (license)\n\nThat ain't feed you falling from your high risk\n\nAs you watch me go, yeah\n\n\n\nBaby, tell me where your friends now?\n\nBaby, that's you on the way down\n\nYou know I be there to catch ya\n\n'Cause I'm faded with my arms out\n\nBut you won't remember when I\n\nCall on you when I break\n\n\n\nHow can you love me? How can you love me?\n\nHow can you love me?\n\nHow can you love me? How can you love me?\n\nHow can you love me when you don't have a heart?\n\nWhen you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart\n\nWhen you don't have a heart, when you don't have a heart\n\n\n\nHeart out of reflections\n\nYour fake friends, they all come and go, come and go\n\n[?] stay-at-homes may crumble\n\nBut my love will grow, my love will grow\n\n\n\nWhen you don't have a heart\n\nWhen you don't have a heart\n\nWhen you don't have a heart\n\nWhen you don't have a heart\n\n\n\nWhen you don't... a heart\n\nWhen you don't... a heart\n\nWhen you don't... a heart"
