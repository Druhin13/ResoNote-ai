  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Blue par Pianos Become The Teeth\r\nWould you believe it?\nI'm a family man now\nAnd here's your boy's boy\nAll blue eyed and stubborn, I wonder\nWhere's he get it all from?\nThis sandy honey hair?\nThis hell of a temper?\nI never knew mine\nHe'll never know his\nBut it's so good to see you again\n\nSo haunt a little more\nBeen so long since you've been here with us\n\nWould you believe it?\nFamily man now\n\nIt's about time\nHis first years, his first snow, it's perfect\nYeah it's beautiful when he talks to you\nHe's sleeping in your room, go meet him\nKeep him warm tonight\n\nSo haunt a little more\nSo long, it's time to put you to bed\nHaunt, take out your teeth\nSo long, just put the worry away\nLaugh and let go\nIt's time for you to rest\n\nWe're alive but tired\nWe all agree he's got your eyes\nAfter all this time\nWe all agree he's got your eyes\nIn a certain light\n\nWe all agree he's got your eyes\nAnd I could die\nTo see him sitting by your side"
