  "lyrics": "I've been a wild rover for many's the year\r\nAnd I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer\r\nBut now I'm returning with gold great store\r\nAnd I never will pay the wild rover no more\r\nAnd it's no, nay, never\n\nNo, nay, never no more\n\nWill I pay the wild rover\n\nNo, never no more\n\n\n\nI went into an alehouse I used to frequent\n\nAnd I told the landlady me money was spent\n\nI asked her for credit, she answered me \"nay\"\n\n\"Such a custom as yours I can have any day\"\n\n\n\nAnd it's no, nay, never\n\nNo, nay, never no more\n\nWill I pay the wild rover\n\nNo, never no more\n\n\n\nI took out from me pocket ten sovereigns bright\n\nAnd the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight\n\nShe said \"I have whiskeys and wines of the best\n\nSure the words that I spoke they were only in jest\n\n\n\nAnd it's no, nay, never\n\nNo, nay, never no more\n\nWill I pay the wild rover\n\nNo, never no more\n\n\n\nI'll go home to my parents, confess what I'd done\n\nAnd I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son\n\nAnd when they've caressed me as ofttimes before\n\nI never will play the wild rover no more\n\n\n\nAnd it's no, nay, never\n\nNo, nay, never no more\n\nWill I pay the wild rover\n\nNo, never no more\n\n\n\nAnd it's no, nay, never\n\nNo, nay, never no more\n\nWill I pay the wild rover\n\nNo, never no more"
