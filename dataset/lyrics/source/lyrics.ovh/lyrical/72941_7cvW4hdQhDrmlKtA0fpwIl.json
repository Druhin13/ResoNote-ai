  "lyrics": "We're all beginners in here\r\nThere's a price you need to pay\r\nKeep the evening clear\r\nMight be time to run away\r\nStaying inside a bubble around the ohs\n\nGiving into your needs\n\nKeep it up, let's keep flying through the walls\n\nCome on now, won't you please?\n\n\n\nRun, baby, run\n\nWe're leaving nothing undone\n\nYou are my only vision\n\nNo cloudy vision\n\nYou know we've only just begun\n\nAnd baby I want you now\n\n\n\nLet's keep running away\n\nWipe those tears from your face\n\nI want you to stay\n\nIt really would be such a waste\n\n\n\nStaying inside a bubble around the ohs\n\nGiving into your needs\n\nKeep it up, let's keep flying through the walls\n\nCome on now, won't you please?\n\n\n\nRun, baby, run\n\nWe're leaving nothing undone\n\nYou are my only vision\n\nNo cloudy vision\n\nYou know we've only just begun\n\nAnd baby I want you now\n\n\n\nFlying through the walls now\n\nFlying through the walls now\n\nFlying through the walls now\n\nFlying through the walls now\n\nFlying through the walls now\n\nNo cloudy vision\n\nYou know we're only just begun flying through the walls now\n\nFlying through the walls now\n\nFlying through the walls now"
