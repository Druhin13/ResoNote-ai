  "lyrics": "And then I wished you away\r\nI lost those memories\r\nOf the days we weren't\r\nForsaken. Why don't we\r\nJust relax our eyes\r\nAnd fall into a dream\n\nLet it take my mind\n\nWhere owls know my name\n\nAnd it gets colder every day\n\n\n\nLost in eternity's grasp\n\nWithdrawing further from what we have known\n\nThis mentality that we've built\n\nIt's breaking down\n\n\n\nStill running away from it\n\nYou're still dreaming\n\nStill hoping that there's something that may be worth seeking\n\nYou've wasted all that you have been given\n\nStill hoping to find a way to make life worth living\n\n\n\nLost in eternity's grasp\n\nWe'll find no way to weather the storm\n\nThis mentality that we built\n\nIs breaking down\n\n\n\nAll the same\n\nEvery path you take\n\nYou remain\n\nTrapped within your shame\n\n\n\nGo away far away\n\nSeparate from the shame\n\n\n\nLost in eternity's grasp\n\nWithdrawing further from what we have known\n\nThis mentality that we've built\n\nIt's breaking down\n\n\n\nI brought myself to this place\n\nWhere only owls would know me\n\nThis reality that I've built\n\nIs an empty space"
