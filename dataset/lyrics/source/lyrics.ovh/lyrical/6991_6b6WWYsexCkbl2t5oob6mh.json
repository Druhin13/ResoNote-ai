  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Everything in Our Lives par Jethro Tull\r\nThere's a black cloud on the high rise\nAnd a sulphurous haze below\nAnd the seagulls drift darkly\nOn the seaway where long ships go\n\nBut you and I will have everything in our lives\nYes, you and I, we'll have everything in our lives\n\nThere's the sweet sound of oil wells drilling\nAs the new roads come rolling in\nTo throw up playing card houses\nWhile the fortune wheel's in spin\nAnd you and I will have everything in our lives\nYes, you and I, we'll have everything in our lives\n\n\nGot a new car and a loo en suite\nAnd a wage rise every second week\nPropaganda on a balance sheet\nThat guarantees everything\n\nThere's a black cloud on the high rise\nAnd a sulphurous haze below\nAnd the seagulls drift darkly\nOn the seaway where long ships go\n\nBut you and I will have everything in our lives\nYes, you and I, we'll have everything in our lives\n\nGot a new car and a loo en suite\nAnd a wage rise every second week\nPropaganda on a balance sheet\n\nThat guarantees everything"
