  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Herumor par Summoning\r\nFrom every depth of good and ill\nThe mystery which binds me still:\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain,\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain,\n\nFrom the sun that round me rolled\nIn its autumn tint of gold,\nFrom the lightning in the sky\nAs it passed me flying by,\n\nFrom the thunder and the storm,\nAnd the cloud that took the form\nFrom the same source I have not taken\nMy sorrow; I could not awaken\nMy heart to joy at the same tone;\nAnd all I loved, I loved alone.\n\n\nOn the brink of the abyss\nwith a blindfold tied tight\nshould I step into the mist\nor retreat back to the light?\n\nI don't know what is in there\nwhether it be ground or a fall\nI don't know if I shall dare\nto take the step and risk it all"
