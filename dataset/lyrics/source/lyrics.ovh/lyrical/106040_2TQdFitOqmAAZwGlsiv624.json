  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Best of Me par John K\r\nWe were only 16\nYou were on my arm\nThen you moved to city\nAnd we drifted apart\nNever thought I would see you\nNow we're sitting in the dark\nI won't fight this feeling\n\nI don't wanna lie no more\nI don't wanna hide no more\nWhat I found in you is so real\nI don't wanna hide no more\nI don't wanna lie no more\nNow that I found you\n\nImma let you get the best of me\n\nImma let you get the best of me\n\nWaking up next to you\nGot you back in my arms\nDon't it feel like it use to\nLike we were never apart\nNever thought I would see you\nNow we're loving in the dark\nWe can't fight this feeling\n\nI don't wanna lie no more\nI don't wanna hide no more\nWhat I found in you is so real\nI don't wanna hide no more\nI don't wanna lie no more\nNow that I found you\n\nImma let you get the best of me\n\nImma let you get the best of me"
