  "lyrics": "Sometimes I'm tryna get high\r\nSometimes the view is just right\r\nSometimes I drink to get by\r\nSometimes the booze makes us fight\r\nSometimes I don't wanna be found\r\nI'd rather get lost with you\n\n\n\nSometimes I get in my car\n\nDrive nowhere fast\n\nNo rear-view mirror around here\n\nI don't wanna look back\n\nNo it ain't safe\n\nBut nothing means much when it is\n\nNo it ain't safe\n\nBut nothing means much when it is\n\nSo let's have some fun while we're here\n\n\n\nSometimes I get in my car\n\nI don't know where I'm going but I'm gonna go far\n\nSometimes I get in my car\n\nPut a little Kenny on and sing straight from the heart\n\nSometimes I get in my car\n\nAnd I get right out too drunk from the bar\n\nToo drunk from the bar\n\nBut how good is anything\n\nIf you can't share it with you're friends\n\nIt's like everything\n\nIs better when it is\n\nAnd I'm holding on to what I know best\n\nYeah I'm holding on to what I got left\n\nAnd I'm staring down the bottle\n\nAnd the message at the bottom\n\nSaying if it ain't there\n\nThe next one will I promise\n\nI remember the time\n\nI love hanging with you\n\nBut it's better with wine\n\nI remember the time\n\nWhen me and you couldn't put together a dime\n\nAnd really wouldn't spend shit but our time\n\nAnd we were just fine\n\nWhen the going was tough\n\nI am who I am I just hope it's enough\n\nYou got the cards in your hand\n\nBut I'm calling your bluff\n\nAnd when it all falls down\n\nKnow I'm gonna pick up\n\n\n\nSometimes I get in my car\n\nDrive nowhere fast\n\nNo rear-view mirror around here\n\nI don't wanna look back\n\nNo it ain't safe\n\nBut nothing means much when it is\n\nNo it ain't safe\n\nBut nothing means much when it is\n\nSo let's have some fun while we're here"
