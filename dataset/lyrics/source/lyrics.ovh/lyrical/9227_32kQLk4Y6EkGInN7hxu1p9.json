  "lyrics": "First of all I am sorry\r\nDisappointment enthusiast\r\nI am permanently sick\r\nI just threw up at the thought of\r\nBeing honest\r\nWill the old me ever come back?\n\nMy odds unbearably slim\n\nWill you stay for a while and relax?\n\nAs I gather my consciousness\n\nYou're warm, I'm cold, there's no argument\n\nI shrunk, you grew, I just can't pretend\n\n\n\nTo be something greater than me\n\nTo be someone you want me to be\n\nTo be someone you want me to be\n\nTo be someone...\n\n\n\nYou're the copper, I'm the litter\n\nAt the bottom\n\nOf the wishing well\n\nIt looks as if we both have drowned\n\n\n\nWarm hand splash comes\n\nDown on the reach\n\nYou'll never mean much to anyone\n\nBut you mean the world to me\n\n\n\nOut the front door\n\nI watch your body leave\n\nCould you please keep the light on for me\n\nCould you please keep the light on for me\n\nNeighbors shout loudly\n\n\"Hey kid, we're so sorry\"\n\nCould you please keep the light on for me\n\nCould you please...\n\nCould you please just\n\nTouch my hand one more time\n\nOne\n\nTime\n\n\n\nSo I could feel alive again\n\nOne\n\nTime\n\nI blend out\n\nThe past now\n\n\n\nYou shine so bright\n\nI am lost without the lights\n\n\n\nIt was a steep slope\n\nSuch a rapid change\n\nI thought I had it right\n\nThe thought that washed away\n\n\n\nIt was a steep slope\n\nSuch a rapid change\n\nI dreamt of months of snow\n\nYou prayed for days of rain\n\n\n\nIt was a steep slope\n\nSuch a swift, swift wave\n\nI thought I had it right\n\nThe thought that washed away"
