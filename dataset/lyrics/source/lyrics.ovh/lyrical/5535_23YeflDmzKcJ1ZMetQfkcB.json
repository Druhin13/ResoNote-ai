  "lyrics": "You're blinded by your psychopaths, you play your games\r\nSo tell me what's the motivation for the shit you say?\r\n[?] we go again [?]\r\nTen times retaliation so no one fights back\r\nTake your shots, you're gonna wear us out\n\nThe loudest voice is gonna shout 'em down\n\nYou're in over your head and we'll watch you drown\n\nAnd all your lies can't save you now\n\nCan't save you now\n\n\n\nCatch you with a knife in hand, a match to flame\n\nNot a minute's hesitation to shift the blame\n\nYou're guilty now and we all know it so what's the truth?\n\nTell me what's your explanation, what's your excuse?\n\n\n\nHow long before they're gonna find you out?\n\nYour tower walls come crumbling down\n\nIt's an uneasy head that wears the crown\n\nAnd all your lies can't save you now\n\nCan't save you now\n\n\n\nIf I was you I would be freaking out\n\n[?] by the mongrel crowd\n\nPray with tiny hands but there's not a sound\n\nAnd all your lies can't save you now\n\nCan't save you now\n\nCan't save you now\n\nCan't save you now\n\nCan't save you now"
