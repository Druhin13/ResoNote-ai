  "lyrics": "PCH is where we lay our heads\r\nThe ocean beach is where our feet will land\r\nIt's 3 a.m., we're out here on our own\r\nSo make me home, take me home\r\nThe L.A. scene is like a field of dreams\r\nAnd this field of dreams is made for you and me\n\nIt's 4 a.m., we're out here on our own\n\nSo take me home, just take me home, home\n\n\n\nI feel strange, I feel strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nNo, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights\n\nI feel strange, so strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nWhen the rest of the world is sleeping\n\nWe're up all night\n\n\n\nPCH is where we race too fast\n\n'Cause the human race was never meant to last\n\nIt's 5 a.m., we'll make it on our own\n\nWe're going home, girl, we're going home, home\n\n\n\nI feel strange, I feel strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nNo, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights\n\nI feel strange, so strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nWhen the rest of the world is sleeping\n\nWe're up all night\n\n\n\nI feel strange, I feel strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nNo, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights\n\nI feel strange, so strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nWhen the rest of the world is sleeping\n\nWe're up all night\n\nWe're up all night\n\n\n\nI feel strange, I feel strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nNo, it don't feel right, homesick for the city lights\n\nI feel strange, so strange\n\nEvery time that I'm away from you\n\nWhen the rest of the world is sleeping\n\nWe're up all night"
