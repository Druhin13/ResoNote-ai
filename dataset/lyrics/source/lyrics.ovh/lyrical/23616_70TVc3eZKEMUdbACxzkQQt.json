  "lyrics": "Some angels will carry you homeward\r\nOther angels you don't wanna meet\r\nMy guardian angel's got wings of tinfoil\r\nAnd cigarettes found in the street\r\nMy angel's got eyes like a housing project\r\nHe was born inside a guitar\n\nAnd i can't forget his red lips and eyelashes\n\nAnd his \"How'd we end up where we are?\"\n\n\n\nThere's nothing doing on the main streets\n\nLet's take the alley for the evening\n\nAnd we're driving in a car that won't slow down\n\nMaking ourselves up in the rear view mirror\n\n\n\nI know God lifts up the lowly\n\nI know God lifts up the lowly\n\n\n\nWe're searching the trunk every morning\n\nWe tore out a tracking device\n\nAnd I pray for plagues to come down on this Egypt\n\nAnd I dream of blood, fire and lice\n\nI wake with my coat for a blanket\n\nMy angel's been up for an hour\n\nI've looked deep into this frail human body\n\nAnd I know that I carry a power\n\n\n\nWe'll never make it on the main streets\n\nThey'll force us back into the alley ways\n\nAnd we're re-arranging furniture\n\nIn a burning house\n\n\n\nI know God lifts up the lowly\n\nI know God lifts up the lowly\n\n\n\nRam v'nisa, gadol v'nora\n\nMashpil ge'im u'magbiha shfalim\n\nMotzi asirim u'podeh anavim\n\nV'ozer dalim\n\nV'oneh l'amo b'et shavam eilav"
