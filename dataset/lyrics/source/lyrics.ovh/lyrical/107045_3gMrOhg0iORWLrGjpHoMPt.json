  "lyrics": "Like a revelation\r\nLike a beam of light\r\nLike a holy ghost betrayed in the afterlife\r\nIt's the new religion\r\nIt's a better way\r\nIt's a new tomorrow till we're all replaced\n\n\n\nIn a world sold out\n\nI can't shout it out\n\nNo, I can't shout it out\n\nWell, the time is now\n\nTurn up the silence and burn out the fire\n\n\n\nIt's an aggravation\n\nIt's a mystery\n\nSo many find their solace in technology\n\nAn abomination\n\nIt's a new disease\n\nWell, the time has come to power down and breathe\n\n\n\nIn a world sold out\n\nI think we're burning out\n\nI think we're burning out\n\nWell, the time is now\n\nTurn up the silence and burn out the fire\n\nIt's screaming in silence, the call of the wild\n\n\n\nBut how this ends, I guess we'll have to wait and see\n\nBut it don't look that good to me\n\nYou can't defend the things you claim have set you free\n\nWhen you're a slave to the machine\n\n\n\nIn a world sold out\n\nI think we're burning out\n\nI think we're burning out\n\nWell, the time is now\n\nTurn up the silence and burn out the fire\n\nIt's screaming in silence, the call of the wild\n\nThe call of the wild"
