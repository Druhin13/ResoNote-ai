  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Good News par The Garden\r\nWe don't need the phone to ring to hear some good news\nDigging through this life is not to have a good snooze\nVaguely have a listen, guess you thought it was a joke\nNot my problem, isn't his - you can't see through the smoke\nWe don't need the phone to ring to hear some good news\nCraft a life that I want, doesn't matter if I lose\nMuch is unexplainable, don't take it as a threat\nAfraid of things I've things I've never done, I put that trash to bed\n\n\nWhat's up bitch? Show your badge bitch\nDon't give a juice if you got that badge bitch\nSpeed off 100, leave me in the dust\nLike Wile E. Coyote, I didn't deserve it\nWalk in like you own the place\nMouth off to her like you own the place\nWish I was there so I could shit on your face\nGet your ass out the store, you fuckin disgrace\n\nI don't think I deserve it\nEvery damn day we got a new issue\nA fuck down the block, bashed out windows\nNo help from the law\n\nAll I wanna do is make notes\nSit on down, get right to it\nLook at the clock, don't stop doing it\nEven if I'm being smothered, don't stop doing it!\n\n\nWe don't need the phone to ring to hear some good news\nPulling up your peers, yeah you got the right to choose\nTrouble around the corner chain strangled by my debt\nBut life is like a ride on a cloud, I can't forget\nWe don't need the phone to ring to hear some good news\nAdvantage what I got and a nauseous feeling too\nTip your server generous and don't forget to chew\nKnife and slice perspective, yeah you're bound to change your view\n\nI'm not really that mad\nJust a couple issues that I had\n\nIn the grand scheme it's no big deal\nIf I could I'd seal the deal\nTake 'em all out for a dinner on me\nBring 'em up to my speed\nThen maybe we'd be happy\nPsych!\n\nIf I saw you again I'd pop your wheels\nMaybe take you to a car dealership\nAnd give you a couple bad deals\nWhat else are car dealerships for\nMake you think your getting\nSomething good and then bang you're in the hole\nWhat'd you think you were getting into\nIn too deep without the re-do\n\nNot a god of the word\nBut any old hack can understand - the message\n\nIf you disagree\nQuestion mark your panorama but not for me"
