  "lyrics": "Right now da ting hopefully get real\r\nRight now da ting hopefully get real\r\nRight now da ting hopefully get real\r\nRight now da ting hopefully get real\r\nI wait no corners if they cut no deal\n\nWhen the sun goes down\n\nAligned, the world won't stay\n\nCome lay down here beside me\n\nWaitin' for the break of day\n\n\n\nIn the darkest night\n\nThe moon she stays away\n\nCome on, hold me close tonight\n\nWe're waitin' for the break of day\n\nCome and hold me close tonight\n\nWaitin' for the break of day (for the break, for the break)\n\n\n\nYeah! Blue moon rising\n\nTides and dark skies\n\nOvernight passing ships will collide\n\nOverside clearly seen at moon-tide\n\nChest full belly\n\nI think I'm swallowed by\n\nPace back and forth\n\nStill can't find the motion\n\nWeary hands tremor\n\nSo they pray up devotion\n\nA minimum toll\n\nSo the soul must pay\n\nWith tears streaming down\n\nCry for the break of day\n\n\n\nIn the fallin' rain\n\nAll your trust betrayed\n\nThem that try to ease your pain\n\nAre waitin' for the break of day\n\n\n\nWhen the laws are wicked\n\nYou're forced to disobey\n\nStand out there on the picket line\n\nWaitin' for the break of day\n\nYou stand out there on the picket line\n\nWaitin' for the break of day\n\n\n\nYou see some politicians\n\nYou hear the things they say\n\nYou hear the falseness in their positions\n\nWe're waitin' for the break of day\n\n\n\nWhen the light of wisdom\n\nPines itself away\n\nThere is yet another kingdom\n\nWaitin' for the break of day\n\nThere is yet another kingdom\n\nWaitin' for the break of day"
