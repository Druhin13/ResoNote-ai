  "lyrics": "Oh, I think I landed in a world I hadn't seen\r\nWhen I'm feeling ordinary\r\nWhen I don't know what I mean\r\nOh, I think landed where there are miracles at work\r\nFor the thirst and for the hunger\n\nCome the conference of birds\n\n\n\nSaying it's true\n\nIt's not what it seems\n\nLeave your broken windows open\n\nAnd in the light just streams\n\n\n\nAnd you get a head\n\nA head full of dreams\n\nYou can see the change you want to\n\nBe what you want to be\n\n\n\nThen you get a head\n\nA head full of dreams\n\nInto life, I've just been spoken\n\nWith a head full, a head full of dreams\n\n\n\nOh I think landed where there are miracles at work\n\nWhen you've got me open handed\n\nWhen you got me lost for words\n\n\n\nI sing oh oh oh oh...\n\nOh oh oh oh...\n\nA head full of dreams (oh oh oh oh...)\n\nA head full of dreams (oh oh oh oh...)\n\n\n\nInto life, I've just been spoken\n\nWith a head full, a head full of dreams"
