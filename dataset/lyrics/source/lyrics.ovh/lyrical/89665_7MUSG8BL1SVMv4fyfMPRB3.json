  "lyrics": "Are you gonna swim the sea, against the tide\r\nCan you see these arms, they're flung open wide\r\nIt brings me to my knees all this in my dream\r\nSo will you be the vine that climbs the walls to me\r\nAnd I said, oh\n\nLet it pull you from the depths of the ocean\n\nOh, until you feel that maybe you're not alone\n\n\n\nIt's coming down the river\n\nI'm falling like a meteor\n\nYou know when it hits ya\n\nWhen love is in the picture\n\nYou could be the dreamer\n\nYou could be the fighter\n\nBut don't ever be a stranger\n\nWhen love is in the picture\n\n\n\nSee it creeping in in red and gold\n\nIt's in the shadows where your teeth bare your soul\n\nSo will you meet me out there in that field\n\nSo in a garden bursting for [?]\n\n\n\nAnd I said, oh\n\nWhen I look to you on the border I'll breathe you\n\nOh, until you feel that maybe you're not alone\n\n\n\nIt's comin' down the river\n\nI'm falling like a meteor\n\nYou know when it hits ya\n\nWhen love is in the picture\n\nYou could be the dreamer\n\nYou could be the fighter\n\nBut don't ever be a stranger\n\nWhen love is in the picture\n\n\n\nIt's comin' down the river\n\nI'm falling like a meteor\n\nYou know when it hits ya\n\nWhen love is in the picture\n\nYou could be the dreamer\n\nYou could be the fighter\n\nBut don't ever be a stranger\n\nWhen love is in the picture"
