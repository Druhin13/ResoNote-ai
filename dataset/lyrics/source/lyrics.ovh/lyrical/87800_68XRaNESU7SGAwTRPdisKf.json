  "lyrics": "Moment of honesty,\r\nSomeones gotta take the lead tonight\r\nWhose it gonna be?\r\nI'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me\r\nIf you have something to say\r\nYou should say it right now\n\n(You should say it right now)\n\n\n\nYou give me a feeling that I never felt before\n\nAnd I deserve it, I know I deserve it\n\nIts become something that's impossible to ignore\n\nAnd I can't take it\n\nI was wondering maybe\n\nCould I make you my baby\n\nIf we do the unthinkable will it make us look crazy\n\nIf you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)\n\nIf you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)\n\n\n\nI know you said to me\n\nThis is exactly how it should feel when its meant to be\n\nTime is only wasting so why wait for eventually\n\nIf we gonna do something about it\n\nWe should do it right now\n\n(We should do it right now)\n\n\n\nYou give me a feeling that I never felt before\n\nAnd I deserve it, I know I deserve it\n\nIts becoming something that's impossible to ignore\n\nIts what we make it\n\n\n\nI was wondering maybe\n\nCould I make you my baby\n\nIf we do the unthinkable\n\nWill it make us look crazy\n\nOr would it be so beautiful\n\nEither way I'm sayin\n\nIf you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)\n\nIf you ask me I'm ready (I'm ready)\n\n\n\nSayin\n\nwhy give up before we try\n\nFeel the lows before the highs\n\nClip our wings before we fly away (fly away)\n\nI can't say I came prepared\n\nI'm suspended in the air\n\nWon't u come be in the sky with me"
