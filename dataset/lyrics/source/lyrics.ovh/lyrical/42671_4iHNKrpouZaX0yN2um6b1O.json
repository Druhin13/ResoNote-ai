  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Last Call par The Reklaws\r\nOne a.m., boy you're runnin' out of time\nSay it, go ahead and blur those lines\nYou might be nervous, you've still got to earn it\nOne drink, I'm gone\nBoy you'll regret it, wishin' you had said it when the lights come on\n\nAll my friends are goin' home, ain't no time to take it slow\nWhere this goes, we'll never know if you don't get my number\nSparks are flyin' all night\nIt wasn't just the neon signs\nDon't you wanna roll the dice so you don't have to wonder\nLast dance, last song, last chance to fall\n\nLast glance, last shot, la la la last call\n\nI know we're young and this bar is closing soon\nBut where I come from, a girl never makes the first move\nThe bands stop playin', I'm just sayin'\nYeah you're on the clock\nBoy don't think, put down that drink\nTick, tick, tick tock\n\nAll my friends are goin' home, ain't no time to take it slow\nWhere this goes, we'll never know if you don't get my number\nSparks are flyin' all night\nIt wasn't just the neon signs\nDon't you wanna roll the dice so you don't have to wonder\n\nLast dance, last song, la la la last chance to fall\nLast glance, last shot, la la la last call\n\nIt might be a flame, it might be the real thing\nDon't let me be the last to know\n\nAll my friends are goin' home, ain't no time to take it slow\nWhere this goes, we'll never know if you don't get my number\nSparks are flyin' all night\nIt wasn't just the neon signs\nDon't you wanna roll the dice so you don't have to wonder\nLast dance, last song, la la la last chance to fall\nLast glance, last shot, la la la last call\n\nLast dance, last song, last chance to fall\nLast glance, last shot, la la la last call"
