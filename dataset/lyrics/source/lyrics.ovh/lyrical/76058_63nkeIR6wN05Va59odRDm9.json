  "lyrics": "We came from an island\r\nIn the sand and the sun\r\nHidden away from the world\r\nIs that home of fun\r\nWe surfed all day\r\nAnd ate food all night\n\nWhen there was no more food\n\nEating sand was alright\n\n\n\nBut then one dark day out of the sky\n\nSpace Monster \"M\" and friends\n\nInvaded our world\n\nAnd we had to escape\n\nBut we vowed to return again\n\nFirst we'd take over the world\n\nAnd then we'd return again\n\n\n\nWe floated across the ocean\n\nin a hollowed out log\n\nFrom the blue beaches\n\nto the land of smog\n\nWe washed up on the beach\n\nThe Professor took us in\n\nAnd that's when the experiments begin\n\nHe gave us super powers from chemicals\n\nThen he gave us instruments\n\nSo we could rock and roll\n\n\n\nNow we're here to fight\n\nTo make our foes and friends\n\nTo take your money and go home again\n\n\n\nCome fight along\n\nWe're the Aquabats\n\nWe're super super guys\n\nWe're the Aquabats\n\nJoin in our journey to battle our foes.\n\nWatch us every week\n\nOn our TV show.\n\nThe wacky wacky world\n\nOf the Aquabats.\n\nWe're zippy zippy dudes\n\nWe're the Aquabats\n\nWe're the Aquabats\n\nAnd that's that\n\nSo watch us every week\n\nWe're the Aquabats!"
