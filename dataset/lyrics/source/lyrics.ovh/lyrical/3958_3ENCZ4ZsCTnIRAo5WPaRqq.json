  "lyrics": "Takes a step back\nFrom the vacant chair\nLooking in the mirror\nWhile she's combing her hair\nWipes the dust from a cup\nWhile she's cleaning up\n\nWonders very slightly\n\nWhat she's doing there\n\nA simple reflection\n\nCan be too revealing\n\nYears are for counting\n\nYears are for stealing\n\nShe's a mathematician\n\nCalculator\n\nCounting daily\n\nCounting forever...\n\nCold clean glass and a razor blade\n\nFly on the table and a passing car\n\nCloses the curtain to keep in the shade\n\nCloses her head and now she's counting down\n\nDust is collecting\n\nBut she doesn't notice\n\nCounting for ever\n\nShe's a calculator\n\nNo-one can see her\n\nShe's invisible now\n\nNo-one can see her\n\nAnd the dust is collecting"
