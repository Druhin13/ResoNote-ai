  "lyrics": "I always fall\r\nAt school, no one knows him\r\nHe doesn't have an identity\r\nAlone eating lunch\r\nMan, it feels like infinity\n\nBut if they see him cry, that shit would be worse than anything\n\nSo he starts fights, and hides it with masculinity\n\nDad is such a hard-ass, and mom is not around\n\nIt was tough when he was younger but he finally got it down\n\nConvincing everybody he's a comic, he's a clown\n\n'Cause he hides it so well that it can't possibly be found\n\nHe's constantly let down, but he says that he is\n\nHe laughs and jokes about it, but it isn't real\n\nHe just mirrors the emotions that he wish he could feel\n\nBut if no one ever noticed, it's a victory, still\n\n'Til the intensity builds\n\nAnd he can't sensibly deal\n\nWith never-ending emptiness\n\nSo he pretends to be filled\n\nWith a type of happiness that simply doesn't exist\n\nAnd when they notice all them cold shoulders crush him again\n\nThen it's...\n\n\n\nBack to the corner of the world\n\nWhere the sun don't shine\n\nThis place is too familiar\n\nNo matter how far I go, I always fall\n\nBack to the corner of the world\n\nWhere the sun don't shine\n\nThis place is too familiar\n\nNo matter how far I go, I always fall\n\n\n\nToday he considered giving up again\n\nWalked to the freeway, thought about jumping in\n\n'Cause lately, he been suffering\n\nWish he had the guts to win\n\nWish that he was made with some tougher skin\n\nBut it sucks to feel, so he just tucks it in\n\nBeen poppin' those again\n\n'Cause it helps him pretend\n\nEven though the same things overdosed his friends\n\nAt least he got the plug: twenty bucks for ten\n\nStupid prices for some droopy high kid\n\nSmiling about his life as if he truly likes it\n\nBrightens everybody's day, but truly in a crisis\n\nFor Christ's sakes, no one ever asks how his life is\n\n\n\nEveryone around him think he got it all\n\nWhen it's a party, everybody wanna get involved\n\nThen he wake up in the morning and it all dissolved\n\nThat's when he always falls, that's when he always falls\n\n\n\nBack to the corner of the world\n\nWhere the sun don't shine\n\nThis place is too familiar\n\nNo matter how far I go, I always fall\n\nBack to the corner of the world\n\nWhere the sun don't shine (I always fall)\n\nThis place is too familiar\n\nNo matter how far I go, I always\n\n\n\nI always fall\n\nI always fall"
