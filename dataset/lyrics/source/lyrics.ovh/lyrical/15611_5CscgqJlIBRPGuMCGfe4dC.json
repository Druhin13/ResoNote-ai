  "lyrics": "Over the skyline to see the spheres\r\nI lift my eyes to the heavens\r\nNothing sensible has yet appeared\r\nIn this irrational season;\r\nBut the light is wilder here\r\nOut on the edge of reason\n\nAnd Love burns bright and clear\n\nOut where I cannot seize Him\n\n\n\nAll the way my savior leads me\n\nTo peace thatâ€™s past understanding;\n\nInto the wilderness to find the streams\n\nTo know beyond comprehending\n\nAnd the light is wilder here\n\nOut on the edge of reason\n\nAnd Love burns bright and clear\n\nOut where I cannot seize Him\n\n\n\nThe night is darker here\n\nOut on the edge of reason\n\nBut Love burns bright and clear\n\nOut where I cannot seize Him"
