  "lyrics": "Lo, gently she flows\r\nHer depths hold no secrets\r\nThat's where you'll find my rage\r\nWhere the loss and the tears\r\nTucked away through the years\r\nRise and fall in waves\n\n\n\nIt's time we made time just for talking\n\nIt's time we made time to heal\n\nBut I know she'll be there\n\nWhen I'm lonesome\n\nTo tell me just how I feel\n\n\n\nSoftly, tenderly\n\nUsing delicate voices\n\nShe'll lean in close and draw me near\n\nAnd once I have heard\n\nIt's all I can hear\n\nYou may ramble, my darling\n\nBut I'll always be there\n\n\n\nLo, gently she flows\n\nShe'll drag you along\n\nTo a place just around the bend\n\nWhere rioter roam and nothing is sacred\n\nAnd broken hearts never mend\n\n\n\nHow wonderful it is\n\nHow wonderful\n\nHow wonderful it is\n\nHow wonderful\n\n\n\nIt's time we made time just for talking\n\nIt's time we made time to heal\n\nBut I know she'll be there\n\nWhen I'm lonesome\n\nTo tell me just how I feel\n\n\n\nSoftly, tenderly\n\nUsing delicate voices"
