  "lyrics": "I was weeping underneath the willow tree\r\nI remember that's where we used to play\r\nBut the angels have taken you away from me\r\nI'll be cryin' until my dyin' day\r\nNow it's raining even when the sun is out\n\nAnd a rainbow is coloring what's grey\n\nBut it won't stop all these tears from falling down\n\nI'll be cryin' until my dyin' day\n\n\n\nNever again will I hear your gentle laughter\n\nNever again will I see your soft brown eyes\n\nI'll never understand why you could not stay\n\nI'll be cryin' 'til my dyin' day\n\n\n\nThere's a dark cloud hovering above my head\n\nThere are flowers growing where you lay\n\nThey'll be watered by these endless tears of mine\n\nI'll be cryin' until my dyin' day\n\nI'll be cryin' until my dyin' day"
