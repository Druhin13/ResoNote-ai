  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson No Matter What par Ryan Stevenson\r\nA lot of us grew up believing\nAt any moment we could lose it all\nAnd at the drop of a hat\nGod might turn His back and move on\nA lot of us feel like we blew it\nThinking that we're just too far gone\nBut I want you to know\nThere's still a hope for you now\n\nNo matter what you've done\nYou can't erase His love\nNothing can change it\nYou're not separated\nNo matter what\n\nThere's never been a better time to get honest\n\nThere's never been a better time to get clean\nSo come as you are\nRun to the cross and be free\nOh, be free\n\nNo matter what you've done\nYou can't erase His love\nNothing can change it\nYou're not separated\nNo matter where you run\nHe's always holding on\nYou're still a daughter, You're still a son\nNo matter what\n\nDon't know what you've been taught\nDon't know what youâ€™ve been told\nAll I know is my God\nWill never let go of you, no-o-o-ooo\n\nAnd I don't know what you've seen\nDon't know what you've been through\nAll I know is my God\nWill never let go of you\nHe'll never let go!\nHe'll never, never, never let you go\n\nNo matter what you've done\nYou can't erase His love\nNothing can change it\nYou're not separated\nNo matter where you run\nHe's always holding on\nYou're still a daughter, You're still a son\nNo matter what\n\nYou're still a daughter, You're still a son!...\nNo matter what"
