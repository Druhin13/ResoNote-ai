Boy, you know you didn't\n\nI hit that lick in Maryland, I bought my mama a Honda Civic\n\nThe hardest thing I had to do in life was leave you\n\nI was showin' you love and had you feelin' like I need you\n\nI'm drinkin' this alcohol right now, I wanna see you\n\nYou made me go hard in this shit, I'm motivated\n\nWhy you had gave up on the kid when I was jaded?\n\nNow I've been drinkin', gettin' faded\n\nThinkin' 'bout how you played me\n\nThinkin' 'bout how you did me\n\n\n\nI be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days\n\nGamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave\n\nSorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, baby\n\nKnew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby\n\nI be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days\n\nGamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave\n\nSorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, baby\n\nKnew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby"
