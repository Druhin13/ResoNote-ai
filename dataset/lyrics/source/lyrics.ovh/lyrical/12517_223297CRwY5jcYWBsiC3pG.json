  "lyrics": "Do any of these words make sense\r\nAm I fighting to be heard but leaving no defence\r\nCan you understand where I’m coming from\r\nAll my friends are dead and their bodies gone\r\nWe live in selfish introspection of our own dark light\r\nPolluting minds with retrospection, was it worth the fight?\n\nI can’t seem to find the escape hatch, but I’m sick of sitting tight\n\n\n\nTrapped inside warheads, I'm bunkered with ashen soul\n\nYour crooked heart’s still beating, begging eyes to witness more\n\n\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own\n\n\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save us\n\nBlack walls surrounding\n\nCan you please save my soul?\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save us\n\nBlack walls surrounding\n\nCan you please save my soul?\n\n\n\nCounting sheep to fall asleep in my lonely hole\n\nIn the wall of this city's ever-darkening core\n\nAll opinions change, as you’ll learn to see\n\nIt seems insincere, call it a human plea\n\nThe blind will lead the blind into their tangled web of lies\n\nChasing phantom visions of a past they left behind\n\nA victim of another hack plan, tired of wasting time\n\n\n\nTrapped inside warheads, I'm bunkered with ashen soul\n\nYour crooked heart’s still beating, begging eyes to witness more\n\n\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own\n\n\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save us\n\nBlack walls surrounding\n\nCan you please save my soul?\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save us\n\nBlack walls surrounding\n\nCan you please save my soul?\n\n\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own\n\nCausing our own demise\n\nCausing our own\n\n\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save us\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save my soul?\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nCan you please save us\n\nAre we just drowning?\n\nAre we just drowning?"
