  "lyrics": "There's a man, desperate time, looking for a wife\r\nYou think I'll find the right one, they'll explode\r\nShe seems like woman-like cycling in the nude\r\nNo wonder then there's yet no one to show\r\nYou can battle your [?]\n\nUp and down the busy creek\n\nThe question though is this\n\nWith [?]\n\n\n\nWhere did you go to, who did you see?\n\nHow did you know I'd be there?\n\nAnd did you remember not to forget\n\nTell me 'cause I don't care\n\n\n\nIf you knew the pain [?] you might know the song\n\nBut if you knew a secret, would you tell?\n\nSeems to me for a [?] we would sell our souls\n\nIf only for the coffers it would swell\n\n\n\nYou can bless your [?] socks\n\nAll the woolly ones at least\n\nThe only problem being\n\n[?] that you can't find the priest\n\n\n\nSo where did you go to, who did you see?\n\nHow did you know I'd be there?\n\nOh, and did you remember not to forget\n\nTell me 'cause I don't\n\nTell me 'cause I don't care\n\nDon't care\n\n\n\nDoesn't mean the world is coming to an end\n\nDoesn't mean there won't be no [?]\n\nIf you [?]\n\nAre you off your luck, we're all just having fun\n\n\n\nTake your time, learn your lines, call somebody's bluff\n\nBut don't try to [?] know what I mean\n\nUse your head, make your bet, turn the duvet round\n\n[?] moonlight [?]\n\n\n\nWhen the waiting is too long\n\nStretching right around the block\n\nIt's hard enough to [?]\n\nWhere it starts is where it stops\n\n\n\nSo where did you go to, who did you see?\n\nHow did you know I'd be there?\n\nOh, and did you remember not to forget\n\nTell me 'cause I don't\n\nTell me 'cause I don't\n\nTell me 'cause I don't\n\nTell me 'cause I don't care\n\nDon't care"
