  "lyrics": "The throb slap in the Ghost\r\nPut your finger on the trunk, feel the pulse\r\nI never leave the teepee without the toast\r\nYou see the liquid on my chain, I flamboast\r\nWhen I'm higher than Pluto, I eat menudo\r\nPastel de elote, might think I'm an es√©\n\nI sleep with my cuete, I'll leave your ass wete\n\nVallejo, Cali-harm-ya, 7-O-siete\n\nThe Good Book is my buckler and shield\n\nDeath could come outta nowhere, like when the rock hit your windshield\n\nThat's why I always keep a rototiller\n\nWhen I'm out there in the field in the traffic making deals\n\nEvery stack I get, like Kaepernick, I kneel\n\nAin't talking about no dinner but I need a meal\n\nRelease my niggas down waiting for appeal\n\nIn a gladiator tank, sharks and eels...BIATCH!\n\n\n\nAnd these days, gotta watch who you trust\n\nKeep that pistol by my side, in this block I trust\n\nI came from nothin' so I had to run it up\n\nThey just wanna see me fail, they don't wanna see me up\n\nAnd I know the Lord chose me\n\nTo have the vision in what most don't see\n\nI got money, started hating on me\n\nNiggas that I used to love tryna stonewall me\n\nAnd I know money bring hate but I'ma keep getting this cake\n\nAnd no, my soul won't change\n\nReal niggas can't relate to the fake\n\nAnd niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball\n\nI know niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball, ball\n\n\n\nOff top Tommy, rollin' up a mummy\n\nThumbin' through his money, thumper by his tummy\n\nBlowin' on a branch, higher than an avalanche\n\nHazy like a forest fire in a Napa Valley ranch\n\nCash flow Cliff, sippin' on a fifth\n\nSpill more liquor on his shirt, got a hole in his lip\n\nSitting on some cheddar and them niggas know better\n\nSemi-auto wetter fly your head like a feather\n\nHoney coochie slap, smell like a Life Saver\n\nBaby booty stacked like a Sunday newspaper\n\nBitch, I'm a mack, not a caped crusader\n\nCaptain-Save-a-Batch? Nope, I check yaper\n\nMoney on my mind, money on my mind\n\nIf I do the crime, I'ma do the time\n\nNever drop a dime, never drop a dime\n\nHold water on my chest, high alkaline\n\n\n\nAnd these days, gotta watch who you trust\n\nKeep that pistol by my side, in this block I trust\n\nI came from nothin' so I had to run it up\n\nThey just wanna see me fail, they don't wanna see me up\n\nAnd I know the Lord chose me\n\nTo have the vision in what most don't see\n\nI got money, started hating on me\n\nNiggas that I used to love tryna stonewall me\n\nAnd I know money bring hate but I'ma keep getting this cake\n\nAnd no, my soul won't change\n\nReal niggas can't relate to the fake\n\nAnd niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball\n\nI know niggas wanna see me fall, so on my momma, I'ma ball, ball\n\n\n\n(ProHoeZak music)"
