  "lyrics": "Boy meets girl and the world stops turning\r\nShe makes him forget all the rules he was learning\r\nThey give a toast to the ones who never stop hoping\r\nThere's not much to lean and eyes wide open\r\nAnd they look up high and wonder what the future's gonna hold\n\nWill we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life\n\nWhere we laughed till we cried and our love was stronger with every fight\n\nThere'll be a thousand moments for you to say \"I told you\"\n\nAnd a million more for us to say \"I love you\"\n\nSo let's look forward to you and I looking back\n\nAt 99 years like that\n\nAt 99 years like that\n\n\n\nThey build a house of love in the face of worry\n\nBut life has a way of rewriting the story\n\nThere were times when it looked like nothing could save them\n\nThere were times when it looked like nothing could break them\n\nThey keep promising each other what the future's gonna hold\n\n\n\nWill we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life\n\nWhere we laughed till we cried and our love was stronger with every fight\n\nThere'll be a thousand moments for you to say \"I told you\"\n\nAnd a million more for us to say \"I love you\"\n\nSo let's look forward to you and I looking back\n\nTo 99 years\n\n\n\nOf nothing unspoken\n\nWith every day hoping\n\nThat when we feel broken\n\nOur scars make us golden\n\nIs to choose you and I\n\n\n\nWill we look back down on 99 years of a wonderful life\n\nWhere we laughed till we cried and our love was stronger with every fight\n\nThere'll be a thousand moments for you to say \"I told you\"\n\nAnd a million more for us to say \"I love you\"\n\nSo let's look forward to you and I looking back\n\nAt 99 years like that\n\nOh, at 99 years like that\n\nAt 99 years like that"
