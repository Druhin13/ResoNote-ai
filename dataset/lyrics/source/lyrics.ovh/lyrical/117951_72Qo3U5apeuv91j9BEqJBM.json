  "lyrics": "I don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side\r\nYou really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide\r\nWe don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down\r\nBut she don't gotta know 'bout nothing\r\nBut she don't gotta know...\n\nAnd if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?\n\nAnd when we feel alive I know she'll let me go\n\nWhen you read my lips, I know you feel all cold\n\nBut I promise you my heart is made of gold\n\n\n\nI don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide\n\nYou're only on my mind when I need you\n\nI don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down\n\nCause I don't gotta know about nothing\n\nCause I don't gotta know...\n\n\n\nAnd if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?\n\nWhen we feel alive I know she'll let me go\n\nWhen you read my lips, I know you feel my cold\n\nBut I promise you my heart is made of gold"
