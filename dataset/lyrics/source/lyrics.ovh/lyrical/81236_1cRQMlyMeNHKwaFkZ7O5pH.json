  "lyrics": "Destroyed, destroyed, you took my everything\r\nYou came, you saw, you left me nothing but pain\r\n[?] you wouldn't go away\r\nMurder of crows, I guess I'm here to stay\r\nI guess I'm here to stay\n\nBetrayed, betrayed, you are not welcome here\n\nYou crushed my soul and now you won't disappear\n\nI grow to hate you more and more each day\n\nBut now I know that you are here to stay\n\nThat you are here to stay\n\nYou weren't invited\n\n\n\nBut you, take everything you want\n\nYou, take everything you need\n\nYou, take everything you want\n\nLeave me with nothing but bones under my skin\n\n\n\nI can't erase you from my memories\n\nDenounce, deceive, you left me with your disease\n\nMy hope, it dies a little more each day\n\n'Cause now I know that you are here to stay\n\nThat you are here to stay\n\n\n\nYou weren't invited but you, take everything you want\n\nYou, take everything you need\n\nYou, take everything you want\n\nLeave me with nothing but bones under my skin\n\n\n\nYou weren't invited but you, take everything you want\n\nYou, take everything you need\n\nYou, take everything you want\n\nLeave me with nothing but bones under my skin"
