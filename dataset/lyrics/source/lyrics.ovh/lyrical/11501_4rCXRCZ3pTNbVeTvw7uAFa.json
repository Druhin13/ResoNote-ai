  "lyrics": "I had that dream again\r\nGrinding teeth through an absent head\r\nLosing control again\r\nTo forget is to be calm\r\nBy passing broken fingers through aching palms\r\nYou will awake again\n\n\n\nIf all you are is under the surface\n\nThen why is it so hard to be a conduit?\n\n\n\n\"I went lucid,\" she said\n\nTried every minute of my waking unconsciousness\n\nTo start again\n\nBut the man in the doorway, he always had better plans\n\n'Cause an idle mind is the fault of idle hands\n\nAnd you can't break the boy to forge a better man\n\n\n\nIf all you are is under the surface\n\nThen why is it so hard to be a conduit?\n\nIf all you are is under the surface\n\nThen why is it so hard to be a conduit?\n\nIf all you are is under the surface\n\nThen why is it so hard to be a conduit?\n\nChalk it up to cognitive dissonance\n\nI am aware and I will remember this\n\nIf all you are is under the surface\n\nThen why is it so hard to be a conduit?"
