  "lyrics": "We are subject to an end\r\nThe human condition\r\nMake a symbol of yourself now\r\nWhen will our wisdom corrode\r\nDecline and die?\n\nWiped from the canvas\n\nRemap, rewire\n\nMemories on file\n\nReanimate\n\n\n\nReading dreams, weeding out the secrets\n\nSeeking strength something stronger than faith\n\nReading dreams, reaching deep into our cortex\n\nWe welcome the incorporation of steel\n\n\n\nWe're ever-changing, increasing networks\n\nMillions of miles interlaced like trees\n\nCome on the voyage, what's stored in the forest\n\nExplore the connectome, discover yourself\n\nDiscover yourself\n\n\n\nWhen will our wisdom corrode\n\nDecline and die?\n\nWiped from the canvas\n\nRemap, rewire\n\nMemories on file\n\n\n\nMan is forever advancing\n\nCreating his own gods\n\nThe layers are stacking\n\nThe limits are long gone\n\nWe'll see the future intact or torn\n\nWealthy preserving the wrong resource\n\nBetween love and hate\n\nThe layers are stacking"
