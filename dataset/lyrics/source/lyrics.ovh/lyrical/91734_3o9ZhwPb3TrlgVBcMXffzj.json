  "lyrics": "In your house I got my suitcase 'cause I'm heading out\r\nAnother problem's that we danced around are hanging in the midnight air\r\nI know you're tempted to just leave 'em there\r\nOur time is short so we don't take our chances\r\nYou should know that\n\nNothing you say's gonna push me away\n\nSo don't brush it under the rug\n\n'Cause when we get through the struggle\n\nThat's when we level up\n\n\n\nLast week I, I had too much clutter in my mind\n\nWasted so much of our precious time\n\nI swear it scared me\n\nYes, it's true, I didn't hold you like I wanted to\n\nYou ease my mind just like you always do\n\nThat's when you tell me\n\n\n\nNothing you say's gonna push me away\n\nSo don't brush it under the rope\n\n'Cause when we get through the struggle\n\nThat's when we level up\n\n\n\nLevel up"
