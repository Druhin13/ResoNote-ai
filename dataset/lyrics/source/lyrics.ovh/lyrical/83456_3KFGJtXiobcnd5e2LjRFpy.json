  "lyrics": "(Patrick Moten/Geronne C. Turner)\r\nChorus: You're the best thing yet, to ever come into my life\r\nAn understanding hand, when the world calls me grand\r\nYou protect my heart, right from the start\n\nSensitive vibes are strong and true\n\nThe very best I've always shared with you\n\n\n\nAnd if I should fall, or if I'm standing tall\n\nI can see you standing there, always willing to share\n\nEach and every part of me\n\nYou see things I never, never see\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus twice)\n\n\n\nDeep down in my mind, I wonder at the blessing that I could find\n\nSomeone as loving as you\n\nCould bring into my life this feeling so right\n\nAnd so true\n\nLike the flowing waters of a silver stream\n\nAnd like the misty vision in a midnight dream\n\nSuch a wonder of life to me\n\nSo rare is found such a reason to be\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus twice)\n\n\n\nLike the flowing waters of a silver stream\n\nAnd like the misty vision in a midnight dream\n\nSuch a wonder of life to me\n\nSo rare is found such a reason to be\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus twice)\n\n\n\nVamp: You're so wonderful\n\nYou're so beautiful\n\nYou're the best thing yet\n\nTo ever come into my life\n\n\n\n(Repeat vamp)"
