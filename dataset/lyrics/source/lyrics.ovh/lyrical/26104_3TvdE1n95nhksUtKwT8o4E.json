  "lyrics": "Love comes unstuck in the brain\r\nLike a memory stolen\r\nLike a diamond deep in the earth\r\nLike a razor unfolded\r\nLike a million million waves of joy\n\n\n\nNight comes circling in\n\nLike a rain in the ocean\n\nAnd the lights [?] the air\n\nLike a flower unfolding\n\n\n\nLike a million million waves of light\n\nAnd a million million faces run\n\n\n\nLet the fire run over the hill\n\nSo serrated and broken\n\nAnd my heart breaks cover again\n\nAnd I'm running in the open\n\n\n\nTo a million million waves of joy\n\nAnd a million million lights come on\n\nLike a million million baby boys\n\nTo their million million lives unknown"
