  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Journeyman par Jethro Tull\r\nSpine-tingling railway sleepers --- \nSleepy houses lying four-square and firm \nOrange beams divide the darkness \nRumbling fit to turn the waking worm. \nSliding through Victorian tunnels \nwhere green moss oozes from the pores. \nDull echoes from the wet embankments \nBattlefield allotments. Fresh open sores. \n\nIn late night commuter madness \nDouble-locked black briefcase on the floor \nlike a faithful dog with master \nsleeping in the draught beside the carriage door. \nTo each Journeyman his own home-coming \nCold supper nearing with each station stop \n\nFrosty flakes on empty platforms \nFireside slippers waiting. Flip. Flop. \n\nJourneyman night-tripping on the late fantasic \nToo late to stop for tea at Gerard's Cross \nand hear the soft shoes on the footbridge shuffle \nas the wheels turn biting on the midnight frost. \nOn the late commuter special \nCarriage lights that flicker, fade and die \nHowling into hollow blackness \nDusky diesel shudders in full cry. \nDown redundant morning papers \nAbandon crosswords with a cough \nStationmaster in his wisdom \ntold the guard to turn the heating off."
