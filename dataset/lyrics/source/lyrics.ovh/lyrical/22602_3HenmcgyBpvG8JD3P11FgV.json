  "lyrics": "Take me to see the voodoo queen,\r\nLet her put a spell on me,\r\nA little bit of change will ease my pain,\r\nGonna set a young man free.\r\nCause I've been down through your hometown\n\nAnd all across your distant land.\n\nOne things for sure, honey I'll be gone,\n\nTell my mother I miss her so.\n\n\n\nTake me to France and watch me dance,\n\nLet me drink that wine,\n\nSpinning around a dark haired girl,\n\nHaving us a good ol' time.\n\n\n\nCause I've been down through your hometown\n\nAnd all across your distant land.\n\nOne things for sure, honey I'll be gone,\n\nTell my mother I miss her so.\n\n\n\nWhen you can the medicine man,\n\nWill let a feather set me free,\n\nOut on the range outrunning them trains,\n\nYou're never gonna see me leave"
