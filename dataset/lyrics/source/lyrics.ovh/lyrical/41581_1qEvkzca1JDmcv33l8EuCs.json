  "lyrics": "Lay your eyes upon the sky tonight\r\nRealize that you are dead inside\r\nFeel your inner nature calling\r\nCount the stars and count the waves\r\nCount the lives and count the graves\n\nWhy do you feel so important?\n\nSee the boy become a man\n\nSee the girl and understand\n\nLife is bigger than you and me\n\n\n\nLay your eyes upon the sky tonight\n\nRealize that you are dead inside\n\nFeel your inner nature calling\n\n\n\nYou lost connection to the true and divine\n\nFell in a deep hole and lost track of time\n\nNow all your demons eat you up from inside\n\nIt’s safe to say that you are dead in existence\n\nDead in existence\n\n\n\nCan you define what you’re feeling?\n\nOr do you hide your emotions away?\n\nYou show no sign of persistence\n\nYour blood is resistant\n\nOpen your heart 'cause we are all coexistent\n\n\n\nLay your eyes upon the sky tonight\n\nRealize that you are dead inside\n\nFeel your inner nature-\n\nLay your eyes upon the sky tonight\n\nRealize that you are dead inside\n\nFeel your inner nature calling\n\nCalling, calling hey~\n\n\n\n(Lay your eyes upon the sky tonight)\n\nRealize that you are dead inside\n\nFeel your inner nature calling"
