And you can't take that personal\r\nBut shit, I'm from the soil\r\nYou know, I'm from where it's hard, but we play harder\r\nSo I had to be tough, you dig?\r\nAnd I couldn't let nobody roll on me, I was taught to eliminate\n\nYou see, I ain't have a big homie 'cause I wasn't tryna listen to them old niggas anyway\n\nI wanted to do shit my own way and make my own path\n\nAnd school wasn't what I wanted\n\nI ain't see myself as a doctor or a lawyer, I'm a gangsta\n\nI traded in books for bars and hooks\n\n\n\nAyo, my stomach rumblin', I'm hungry but they hid my plate\n\nYou know it's murder when they coming but they hide they face\n\nThey tell me sign, I'm like, \"but I ain't tryna seal my fate\"\n\nThey say \"I love you\" but I know they only hiding hate\n\nI need my freedom 'cause it's priceless, man, make no mistakes\n\nI wear my heart on my sleeve, if you real, you must relate\n\nI'm tryna buy a corvette just to race, uh\n\nCrash it up and return it the very next day\n\nI keep my foot on the pedal, my sneaker size nine\n\nOne hunnid dollars for the cut, I'm talking high stakes\n\nSalt and pepper when you season, keep it real simple\n\nI wasn't kidding, been a man since my first pimple\n\nFirst they hate, then theyâ€”you know how it goes\n\nI plant a seed, they got the water just to see it grow\n\nI needed patience 'cause for me, I felt it moving slow\n\nThat stupid question, like, \"Bodega, why you still ain't blow?\"\n\nWell, sit back and watch the story unfold\n\nWell, what you sell cannot be unsold\n\nI swear, I tried to quit, but music really got control\n\nOf my brain, my heart, my body, even all my bones\n\nMy car was full when I started on this bumpy road\n\nI kept on driving, only one left was my brother, O\n\nWith no mechanic, when the car broke down, we left alone\n\nWe had to fix it on our own, but that's the price of goals\n\nJust to get the goal, we had to keep our faith secured\n\nSo many horses in the engine, you can smell manure\n\nSo when it rains, let it rain, let it really pour\n\n'cause when I'm rich, I won't forget that I was really poor\n\n'cause when I'm up, I won't forget that I was really down\n\nA rare find, I was lost, but I really found\n\n\n\nPray for me, pray for me, pray for me\n\nYou know I really need it, Lord Jesus\n\nPray for me, pray for me, pray for me\n\nYou know I really mean it, yo\n\n\n\nI know people who got murdered over dice games\n\nMother's shooting dope, son watching Ice Age\n\nThis is all I know, this is all I know\n\nThis is all I heard, this is all I see\n\nThis is all I show\n\nSay a prayer for your boy, what\n\nSay a prayer for your boy, what\n\n\n\nI don't, I don't need extra bread\n\nI don't need nobody putting me on or anything\n\n'cause at the end of the day, my nigga, I'm showing for me, bro\n\nAnd I rep this, my nigga, this Tanboys thing right here, because of y'all, bro\n\nBecause of you, my nigga\n\nAnd I love y'all niggas, bro\n\nAnd I love y'all niggas and I'm loving what y'all represent\n\nThis right here, this right here, I do this for my regular niggas, my nigga\n\nAnd that goes to show you, my nigga, if I dealing with you, I do it because I love y'all niggas, bro\n\nI don't do it for nobody else, my nigga\n\nMy nigga, Rome Capone, here, 'bout to pop that bubbly, huh?\n\nOh shit, it's all good\n\nIt's for the homies, man\n\nChasing it with the Henny, man"
