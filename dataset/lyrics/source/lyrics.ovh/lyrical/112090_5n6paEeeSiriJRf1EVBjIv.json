  "lyrics": "I know a few ten-cent words\r\nI can break out to keep up with her\r\nBut you can take what I know about love\r\nAnd drown it in the sink\r\nI know my way around a tune\n\nWon't be a single dry eye in a room\n\nBut you can take what I know about you\n\nAnd maybe fill a small balloon\n\n\n\nBut I'm just dumb enough to try\n\nTo keep you in my life\n\nFor a little while longer\n\nAnd I'm insane enough to think\n\nI'm gonna get out with my skin\n\nAnd start my life again\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm no stranger to the female form\n\nOh, I've been here a few times before\n\nOh, but you could have me anytime\n\nEverything's cool, I'm great, it's fine\n\n\n\nOh, but I'm just dumb enough to try\n\nTo keep you in my life\n\nFor a little while longer\n\nAnd I'm insane enough to think\n\nI'm gonna get out with my skin\n\nAnd start my life again"
