  "lyrics": "Well, you're just a band-aid for my loneliness\r\nAnd I'd say that's the baddest case\r\nI tried not to complain but it's hopeless\r\n'Cause you're stuck up here in my brain\r\nCaught up in my feels now\r\nThinking back to when I used to make myself proud\n\nShe leaves before the sun's up\n\nWhile I'm dreaming of somebody who I need now\n\n(While I'm dreaming of somebody who I need now)"
