  "lyrics": "My favorite movies are tales never filmed\r\nThat I dream of living out\r\nA private screening that plays in the field\r\nBut I'm trapped inside this house\r\nWalk through the halls\n\nTrace the walls\n\nBack to where we made our memories\n\nSee what will never be\n\n\n\nThrough unopened windows bound to my heart\n\nFantasy so close, feels so afar\n\nBut I long to break the lock\n\nAnd live among the life we lost\n\nThrough unopened windows, they tear me apart\n\n\n\nI'm sick of hearing that time always heals\n\nTry to tell that to my scars\n\nSure, it stopped the bleeding and it's harder to feel\n\nBut it really left a mark\n\n\n\nI walk through the halls\n\nTrace the walls\n\nBack to where we made our memories\n\nSee what will never be\n\n\n\nThrough unopened windows bound to my heart\n\nFantasy so close feels so afar\n\nBut I long to break the lock\n\nAnd live among the life we lost\n\nThrough unopened windows, they tear me apart\n\n\n\nAll the stories left unwritten that we drew up in the past\n\nIt's the game we never went to or the drinks we never had\n\nAs I look up to the stars and make a wish to bring you back\n\nBut I curse the roof above me and I learn to live behind all these...\n\n\n\nUnopened windows bound to my heart\n\nFantasy so close feels so afar\n\nBut I long to break the lock\n\nAnd live among the life we lost\n\nThrough unopened windows, they tear me apart\n\n\n\nThey tear me apart\n\nThey tear me apart\n\nTo what will never be\n\nThrough unopened windows, they tear me apart"
