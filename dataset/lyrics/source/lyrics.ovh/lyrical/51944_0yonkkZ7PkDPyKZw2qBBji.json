  "lyrics": "Until\r\nThe fire is humbled in the grate\r\nThis cup in its forgotten state, that measured tides, high tides\r\nPhotographs the words\r\nUnspoken\n\nAs a crocus offering saffron token\n\nUntil the dew evaporates\n\nAnd while the clay bakes\n\n\n\nI gestate\n\n\n\nI’m here. I germinate\n\nI’m here. I germinate\n\n\n\nI will give you wanderlust\n\nA tree must, tucked into earth unblinking\n\nSet your compass to me my twin\n\nThe rub of life has moulded every limb\n\nAnd shifter now has settled shape\n\nYou fight to keep yourself awake\n\n\n\nI’m here. I germinate\n\nI’m here. I germinate\n\n\n\nCora stay your hand and let the root keep hold in the ground\n\nI unfold\n\n\n\nI give you until there bleeds a seam of tangerine\n\nWhere bats in a blink eclipse the moon like whipped kerchiefs\n\nIn a courtly swoon\n\n\n\nI’m here. I germinate\n\nI’m here. I germinate\n\n\n\nCora stay your hand and let the root keep hold in the ground\n\nUnfold\n\n\n\nUntil the last seed spills its green\n\nThe last wreath here between deft fingers mend a ring complete\n\nUntil the sea roils sweet\n\nUntil armadas sweep the dead\n\nWest Pier\n\n\n\nI wait\n\nI’m here. I germinate"
