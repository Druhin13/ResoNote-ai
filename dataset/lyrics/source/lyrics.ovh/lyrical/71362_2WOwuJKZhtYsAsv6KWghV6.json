  "lyrics": "(Gary Taylor)\r\nAh, many days it goes unspoken\r\nBut this desire never seems to go away\r\nIt's gonna take much more than hope to bring you close\r\nI think I'll pray\n\n\n\nI hear you say you've got a lot to give up\n\nAnd there is so much more this heart of mine can take\n\nIf what you have to bring to me is positive you send it right away\n\nRight away\n\n\n\nChorus I: I want to know what good love feels like\n\nGood love, good love\n\nI want a love that's sure to stand the test of time\n\nI want to know what good love feels like\n\nGood love, good love\n\nMorning, noon and night, forever all my life\n\nGood love, good love\n\nGood love, good love\n\nThere is a void that stands between us\n\nAnd it seems it's getting harder to relate\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I imagine\n\nLife this way\n\n\n\n(Repeat Chorus I)\n\n\n\nChorus II: I want to know what good love feels like\n\nGood love, good love\n\nI want a love that's sure to stand the test of time\n\nI want to know what good love feels like\n\nGood love, good love\n\nHear me when I say, bring it to me baby\n\n\n\nBabe, you're the man I hear you say you are\n\nI don't understand why loving me is so hard\n\nNever have I felt the need to be this close\n\nWords cannot say, heaven only knows\n\n\n\n(Repeat Chorus I to fade)"
