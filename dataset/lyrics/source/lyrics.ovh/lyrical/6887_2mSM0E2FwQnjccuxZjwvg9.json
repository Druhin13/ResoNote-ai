  "lyrics": "I haven't looked at the sun for so long\r\nI'd forgotten how much it hurts to\r\nThe show ain’t over\r\nThey’ll keep on going\r\nThey’ll keep on laughing\n\nAnd fucking around\n\n\n\nOff into the distance\n\nThose two brothers\n\nThose two lovers\n\nAnd their smooth cocked adventures\n\n\n\nI haven't looked at the sun for so long\n\nI'd forgotten how much it hurts to\n\n\n\nThey just want to be one\n\nWalk off into the sun\n\nThey’re not kissing\n\nThey’re not fucking\n\nThey’re just having fun\n\n\n\nI haven't looked at the sun for so long\n\nI'd forgotten how much it hurts to\n\n\n\nThey were connected\n\nAt the back of the head\n\nThey got a conduit\n\nTheir minds are the same\n\n\n\nThey were connected\n\nAt the back of the head\n\nThey got a conduit\n\nTheir minds are the same\n\n\n\nThis ain’t the end\n\nWe’ll see them again\n\n\n\n[This is the end of the song, it is just a song, it's a version of me and you that can exist outside of everything else and if it is just a fantasy then anything can happen from here. The contract is up, the names have been changed. So pour one out, whoever you are. These are only lyrics now...]\n\n\n\nWhen I come back you'll still be here"
