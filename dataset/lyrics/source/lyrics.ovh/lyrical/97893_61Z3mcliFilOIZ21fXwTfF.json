  "lyrics": "He's the wolf screaming lonely in the night\r\nHe's the blood stain on the stage\r\nHe's the tear in your eye\r\nBeen tempted by his lie\r\nHe's the knife in your back\r\nHe's rage\n\nHe's the razor to the knife\n\nOh, lonely is our lives\n\nMy heads spinnin' round and round\n\nBut in the seasons of wither\n\nWe'll stand and deliver\n\nBe strong and laugh and\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nShout-shout-shout\n\nShout at the devil \n\nHe'll be the love in your eyes\n\nHe'll be the blood between your thighs\n\nAnd then have you Cry for more\n\nHe'll put strength to the test\n\nHe'll put the thrill back in bed\n\nSure you've heard it all before\n\nHe'll be the risk in the kiss\n\nMight be anger on your lips\n\nMight run scared for the door\n\nBut in seasons of wither\n\nWe'll stand and deliver\n\nBe strong and laugh and\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]"
