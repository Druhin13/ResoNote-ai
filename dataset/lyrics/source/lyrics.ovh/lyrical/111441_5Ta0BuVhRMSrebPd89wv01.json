Are you okay?\r\n'Cause I know that you can't sleep\r\nAnd you used to be Broadway\r\nNow you're more of a side street\r\nAnd now all of your big dreams\r\nAll the people you can't meet\n\nAre you okay? Are you okay?\n\n'Cause you're actin' like me (Yeah)\n\n\n\nI just pulled up to your crib\n\nHeart on my sleeve\n\nMan that night was crazy, type of shit I couldn't make up\n\nAnd you look ravishing darling\n\nKisses to the mirror, you look better with no make-up\n\nYeah, remorse is vicious from bad decisions\n\nSurplus of bitches my house is litty\n\nYou want improvement but lacking patience\n\nResentment and indignation\n\nYour mood swings\n\nYour mood swings, they drive me crazy\n\nYou don't really mean what you were saying\n\nI just pulled up to your crib heart on my sleeve\n\nBegging for you back I got on my knees\n\nSo sophisticated, you got what I need\n\nAll that shit I said, I ain't really mean\n\nNow dream, that's the only time I see you now\n\nI wish you stuck around, we could figure out\n\n\n\nAre you okay? Are you okay?\n\n'Cause I know that you can't sleep\n\nAnd you used to be Broadway\n\nNow you're more of a side street\n\nAnd now all of your big dreams\n\nAll the people you can't meet\n\nAre you okay? Are you okay?\n\n'Cause you're actin' like me (Yeah)\n\n\n\nYeah, I know that you're getting tired of my games\n\nAnd you're ready for the stage where I finally grow the fuck up\n\nAnd your whole vibe is amazing\n\nCame thru I was mesmerized after one touch\n\nLowkey with high inhibitions\n\nBack when your heart was in mint condition\n\nI only heard you, I didn't listen\n\nI know this isn't what you envisioned\n\nAre you good? Are you mad? It's hard to tell\n\nYou don't really like to tell me how you feel\n\nI just pulled up to your crib, heart on my sleeve\n\nBegging for you back, I got on my knees\n\nSmart, poised, pretty\n\nYou got what I need\n\nAll that shit I said I don't really mean\n\nNow dreams, that's the only time I see you now\n\nI wish you stuck around we could figure out\n\n\n\nAre you okay? Are you okay?\n\n'Cause I know that you can't sleep\n\nAnd you used to be Broadway\n\nNow you're more of a side street\n\nAnd now all of your big dreams\n\nAll the people you can't meet\n\nAre you okay? Are you okay?\n\n'Cause you're actin' like me (Yeah)\n\n\n\nI see me in everyone else\n\nSo when I see you, I always see myself\n\nAre you okay? 'Cause I can't tell\n\nNow you should ask me, if I need help\n\nI think that I'm ready now\n\nI can never really tell\n\nI think that I'm ready now\n\nI can never really tell"
