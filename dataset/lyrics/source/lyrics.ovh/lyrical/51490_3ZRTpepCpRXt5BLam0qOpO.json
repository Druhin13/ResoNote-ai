  "lyrics": "In my mind it's all the way things were\r\nI remember how the family heard\r\nThey told them everything in the house had burned\r\nAnd all that's left will slowly fade to the earth\r\nIn my mind it's all the way things were\n\nI remember how the family heard\n\nAnd every night the fearful dreams emerge\n\nShe takes her shelter like a flightless bird\n\n\n\nA life worth living? “I don’t know”\n\nA wolf gone hiding in the snow\n\nA love worth killing just to show\n\nJust what it is to let it go\n\nJust what it is to let him go\n\n\n\nIn my mind it's all the way things were\n\nI remember how the family heard\n\nThey told them everything in the house had burned\n\nAnd all that's left will slowly fade to the earth\n\n\n\nShe lay down with him there for weeks\n\nShe heard his body start to creak\n\nAnd when he turned to her to speak\n\nThat’s when he knew his time had peaked\n\nThat’s when he knew their time had peaked\n\n\n\nIn my mind it's all the way things were\n\nI remember how the family heard\n\nThey told them everything in the house had burned\n\nAnd all that's left will slowly fade to the earth\n\n\n\nIn my mind it's all the way things were\n\nI remember how the family heard\n\nAnd every night the fearful dreams emerge\n\nShe takes her shelter like a flightless bird"
