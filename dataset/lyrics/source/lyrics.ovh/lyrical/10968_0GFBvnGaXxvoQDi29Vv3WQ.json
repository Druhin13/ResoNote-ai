  "lyrics": "I will always be here in the needles and the cones\r\nI am here to help you when you're feeling all alone\r\nI can show you places where your mind just goes\r\nCome wade the river, it always flows\r\nIt always flows\n\nHave you stopped to notice?\n\nHave you stopped to notice?\n\n\n\nThis time of year is deadly, dark afternoon\n\nWe all need to change some, but it's gotta come from you\n\nWe all want the answers, but you only find a few\n\nLook at all you have still in front of you\n\nI do, I do, I do\n\n\n\nHave you stopped to notice?\n\nHave you stopped to notice?\n\n\n\nHave you stopped to notice?\n\nYou're moving"
