  "lyrics": "To go, to go, to go, to go\r\nThe sounds (Yeah) Just the wind on my skin\r\nUh, fine fabrics, interior serious\r\nDash board lavish, 14-Karat gold instruments\r\nI'm outside looking at it, I didn't even sit in it yet\n\nI can't believe that it's just how I envisioned it\n\nWatchin' the speed limits baby, we smokin' weed in it\n\nWithout no window tints, to me that don't make no sense\n\nCan't hide, when you this fly\n\nThem niggas is seeing it\n\nTakin' in this sunset on the lake\n\nWhile reminiscing on how narrowly I escaped\n\nWe divide the cake, brunches with the heads of state\n\nMimosas on different coasts and these niggas ain't even close\n\nThey don't want no smoke\n\nThem niggas broke they wan't hand outs\n\nI'd rather hand them a rope\n\nStanding in one place won't get you paid\n\nThey fire desperation shots but I'm not fazed"
