  "lyrics": "This is my kind of town\r\nThis is my kind of place\r\nI wouldn't mind hanging around\r\nFor more than just a couple days\r\nI got a 12th floor room with a killer view\r\nOf an empty Astrodome\n\nA tab at the bar downstairs\n\nBut all I can think about is home\n\n\n\nI got my new boots, covered in red dirt\n\nA \"Don't mess with Texas\" T-shirt\n\nAnd a Lonestar postcard postmarked with \"missin' you\"\n\nIt's got the biggest sky you've ever seen\n\nThe coldest beer you'd ever drink\n\nBut I still feel like I landed on the moon\n\nCause it ain't got you\n\nHouston, we got a problem\n\n\n\nYou should've seen 19th street\n\nYou should've seen a midnight rodeo\n\nThe way them saloon doors swing\n\nWhen they line dance to 'Copperhead Road'\n\nSome like the lager down here\n\nThat'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do\n\nI wish I was an outlaw\n\nBut all I can think about is you\n\n\n\nI got my new boots, covered in red dirt\n\nA \"Don't mess with Texas\" T-shirt\n\nAnd a Lonestar postcard postmarked with \"missin' you\"\n\nIt's got the biggest sky you've ever seen\n\nThe coldest beer you'd ever drink\n\nBut I still feel like I landed on the moon\n\nCause it ain't got you\n\nHouston, we got a problem\n\n\n\nIt's got the biggest sky you've ever seen\n\nThe coldest beer you'd ever drink\n\nBut I still feel like I landed on the moon\n\nCause it ain't got you\n\nHouston, we got a problem\n\nHouston, we got a problem\n\nHouston, we got a problem"
