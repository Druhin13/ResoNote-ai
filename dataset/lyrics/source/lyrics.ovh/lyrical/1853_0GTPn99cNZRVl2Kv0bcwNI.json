  "lyrics": "Sometimes I'm beaten\r\nSometimes I'm broke\r\n'Cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke\r\nIs there a secret?\r\nIs there a code?\r\nCan we make it better?\n\n'Cause I'm losing hope\n\n\n\nTell me how to be in this world\n\nTell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt\n\nTell me how 'cause I believe in something\n\nI believe in us\n\n\n\nAfter the wreckage\n\nAfter the dust\n\nI still hear the howling, I still feel the rush\n\nOver the riots, above all the noise\n\nAnd through all the worry, I still hear your voice\n\n\n\nTell me how to be in this world\n\nTell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt\n\nTell me how 'cause I believe in something\n\nI believe in us\n\nTell me where the light goes down\n\nSo even in the dark we can find our way out\n\nTell me now 'cause I believe in something\n\nI believe in us\n\n\n\nWe used to be kids living just for kicks\n\nIn cinema seats learning how to kiss\n\nRunning through streets that were painted gold\n\nWe never believed we'd grow up like this\n\n\n\nTell me how to be in this world\n\nTell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt\n\nTell me how 'cause I believe in something\n\nI believe in us\n\nTell me where the light goes down\n\nSo even in the dark we can find our way out\n\nTell me now 'cause I believe in something\n\nI believe in us\n\nI believe in something\n\nI believe in us"
