  "lyrics": "In the year of the tiger, I won't weep and moan\r\nGot no time for cooling heels, I've got to roam\r\nIn the year of the tiger, I'm gonna roll these bones\r\nGonna leave behind the heartache that I’ve known\r\nThe only love I've known has slipped away\n\nThe only love I’ve known has gone away\n\n\n\nIn the year of the tiger, I’m gonna stake my claim\n\nRun a thousand miles beyond this house of pain\n\nIn the year of the tiger, I got my kin to save\n\nAnd I'll be damned to see them suffer one more day\n\n\n\nOn a cold, cruel July\n\nWe didn't know just when the pale horse would arrive\n\nBut love alone keeps us alive\n\nWhen we fear we can't go on at all\n\n\n\nIn the year of the tiger, I heard a nightmare scream\n\nCut above the din of every future dream\n\nIn the year of the tiger, well, you'd best believe\n\nI am haunted by the visions that I've seen\n\n\n\nOn a cold, cruel July\n\nWe didn't know just when the pale horse would arrive\n\nBut love alone keeps us alive\n\nWhen we fear we can't go on at all\n\nCan’t go on at all\n\n\n\nIn the year of the tiger, into an ocean grave\n\nThrew his ashes to the wind then walked away\n\nIn the year of the tiger, I got no time to waste\n\nA resolution to keep fighting and remain\n\n\n\nOn a cold, cruel July\n\nWe didn't know just when the pale horse would arrive\n\nBut love alone keeps us alive\n\nWhen we fear we can't go on at all\n\nCan’t go on at all\n\n\n\nIn the year of the tiger\n\nIn the year of the tiger\n\nIn the year of the tiger\n\nIn the year of the tiger"
