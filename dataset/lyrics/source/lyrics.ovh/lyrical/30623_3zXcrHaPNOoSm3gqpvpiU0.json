  "lyrics": "Because I rode up to the edge\r\nBecause the life I lived is dead\r\nBecause I could not find the words\r\nI could not hold it in my head\r\nI make my bed beside the road\r\nMy body glows inside the smoke\n\n\n\nAnd I'm waving off\n\nI carry a diamond blade, I'm moving on\n\nAll defenses down, and when I walk\n\nI carry a diamond blade when you said serve you\n\nI will not\n\n\n\nBecause the spark is in the air\n\nI let it go up by itself\n\nMy tongue is itching with the sound\n\nYou're always singing in my head\n\nI make a home inside the wind\n\nStars are burning in the west\n\n\n\nAnd I'm moving on\n\nI carry a diamond blade, I'm moving on\n\nTo pull the fences down, and when I walk\n\nI carry a diamond blade, I will not serve you\n\n\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow\n\nBlack willow"
