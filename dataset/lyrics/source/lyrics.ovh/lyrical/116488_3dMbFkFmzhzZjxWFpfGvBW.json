  "lyrics": "Looking all around, you think nothing is really working\r\nThe pieces never fit quite naturally\r\nIt didn't come with directions, but somehow we found perfection\r\nAnd it all worked out just how it was meant to be\r\nThrough the passion, through the fights\n\nThe wrong turns we made right\n\nThe one thing, one thing never changed\n\n\n\nAnd this too shall last\n\nWhen the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast\n\nThe feelings, the lonely troubles don’t seem to pass\n\nWe got each other, it will be alright\n\nWe got the love to make it through the night\n\nThis too shall last\n\n\n\nNow the door is always open, never mentioned and never spoken\n\nAnd only we know where we like to hide the keys\n\nAnd no wind could ever weather, what's holding us together\n\nAs long as we live in our home, yeah I believe\n\n\n\nAnd this too shall last\n\nWhen the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast\n\nThe feelings, the lonely troubles don't seem to pass\n\nWe got each other, it will be alright\n\nWe got the love to make it through the night\n\nThis too shall last\n\nThis too shall last\n\n\n\nOh, through the passion, through the fights\n\nThe wrong turns we made right\n\nThis one thing, one thing will never change\n\n\n\nAnd this too shall last\n\nWhen the beauty is gone and time goes by too fast\n\nThe feelings, the lonely troubles don’t seem to pass\n\nWe got each other, it will be alright\n\nWe got the love to make it through the night\n\nThis too shall last\n\nThis too shall last"
