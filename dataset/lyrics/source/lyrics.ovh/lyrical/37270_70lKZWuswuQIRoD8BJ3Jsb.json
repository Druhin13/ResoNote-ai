  "lyrics": "Every morning of the month\r\nYou push a little tablet through the foil\r\nCleverest of all inventions\r\nBetter than a condom or a coil\r\nBecause i didn't wanted my babies until I wanted babies\n\nAnd when i wanted babies, nothing else would do but babies\n\nBabies babies\n\n\n\nEvery touch was terrifying\n\nAll my knowledge from caffeine and prayer(?)\n\nAnxious waiting, diary(?) watching\n\nJust because a boy touched me there\n\n\n\nCause i didn't wanted my babies until I wanted babies\n\nAnd when i wanted babies, nothing else would do but babies\n\nBabies babies\n\n\n\nGo to sleep\n\nIt's 3am\n\nWhere are you?\n\nIt's 3am\n\nIn a cab\n\nAt 3am\n\nDon't wait up\n\nIt's 3am\n\nThe memory (?) or 3am\n\nFeeding you at 3am\n\nRocking chair at 3am\n\nGo to sleep it's 3am\n\n\n\nPlease Please Please\n\n\n\nLay your pretty hair down\n\nGet the fuck to bed now\n\nAll the nights i've paced this floor\n\nBaby love you even more\n\nMade me love you even more\n\n\n\nOh I love my babies\n\nOh I love my babies\n\nOh I love my babies"
