Ooh\r\nHow many times until we had enough?\r\nWe just gotta find a way to love\n\nMy heart is broken just talking about this\n\n'Cause hurt people just hurt people\n\nThey do it, they do everyday\n\n\n\nIf I felt all my lies I know that I'd be broken\n\nTake all these pills to quell fucked up emotions\n\nBill you're so sick, why can't you just be open\n\nYou just be open, you just be open\n\nPush you away to save you from my visions\n\nKilling myself lately, that's been my mission\n\nKnow I'll explode like it's nuclear fission\n\nStuck on these visions, stuck on these visions\n\n\n\n'Cause hurt people just people hurt people\n\nThey do it, they do everyday, yeah\n\nHurt people just hurt people\n\nWhy are we used to the pain? Ooh\n\n\n\nI got burns on my wrists, but that helps keep me focused\n\nHeroin missed its chance, I'm here unbroken\n\nGirl I'm too fucked up, you can't fix these problems\n\nYou'll never solve them, you'll never solve them\n\nI think about you and it drives me crazy\n\nWish I could fix my mind but it's too hazy\n\n20 years old is too young, you won't save me\n\nCan't help me baby, can't help me baby\n\n\n\n'Cause hurt people just hurt people\n\nThey do it, they do everyday, yeah\n\nHurt people just hurt people\n\nWhy are we used to the pain? Ooh\n\n\n\nHow many times until we had enough?\n\nWe just gotta find a way to love\n\nMy heart is broken just talking about this\n\n\n\n'Cause hurt people just hurt people\n\nThey do it, they do everyday"
