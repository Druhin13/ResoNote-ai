(You know it's just too little too late)\n\nYou take my hand, and you say you've changed\n\nBut boy, you know your begging don't fool me\n\nBecause to you, it's just a game (You know it's just too little too late)\n\n\n\nSo let me on down\n\n'Cause time has made me strong\n\nI'm starting to move on\n\nI'm gonna say this now\n\nYour chance has come and gone\n\nAnd you know...\n\n\n\nIt's just too little too late\n\nA little too wrong\n\nAnd I can't wait\n\nBut you know all the right things to say\n\nYou know it's just too little too late\n\nYou say you dream of my face\n\nBut you don't like me, you just like the chase\n\nTo be real\n\nIt doesn't matter anyway\n\nYou know it's just too little too late\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nIt's just too little too late\n\nMmmm\n\n\n\nI was young and in love\n\nI gave you everything, but that wasn't enough\n\nAnd now you wanna communicate (You know it's just too little too late)\n\nGo find someone else\n\nI'm letting you go, I'm loving myself\n\nYou got a problem\n\nBut don't come asking me for help\n\n'Cause you know...\n\n\n\nIt's just too little too late\n\nA little too wrong\n\nAnd I can't wait\n\nBut you know all the right things to say\n\nYou know it's just too little too late\n\nYou say you dream of my face\n\nBut you don't like me, you just like the chase\n\nTo be real\n\nIt doesn't matter anyway (You know it's just too little too late)\n\n\n\nI can love with all of my heart, baby\n\nI know I have so much to give (I go so much to give)\n\nWith a player like you, I don't have a prayer\n\nThat's no way to live\n\nOhh, no, no\n\nIt's just too little too late\n\nYeah...\n\n\n\nIt's just too little too late\n\nA little too wrong\n\nAnd I can't wait\n\nBut you know all the right things to say\n\n(It's too little) You know it's just too little too late\n\nYou say you dream of my face\n\nBut you don't like me\n\nYou just like the chase\n\nTo be real\n\nIt doesn't matter anyway\n\nYou know it's just too little too late\n\nYeah\n\nYou know it's just too little too late\n\nOh, I can't wait, no, no, ooh\n\n\n\nIt's just too little too late\n\nA little too wrong\n\nAnd I can't wait\n\nBut you know all the right things to say\n\nYou know it's just too little too late"
