  "lyrics": "What good is melody, what good is music\r\nIf it ain't possessin' something sweet\r\nIt ain't the melody, it ain't the music\r\nThere's something else that makes the tune complete\r\nIt don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing\r\nIt don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing\n\nIt makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot\n\nJust give that rhythm ev'rything you got\n\nIt don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing"
