  "lyrics": "Give in to the pressure of the sound\r\nOf the voices saying step down\r\nBeast of glutton, the embodiment of greed\r\nExploiting the weak by fabricating their needs\r\nThe wolf kicked in the door, intruded in your home\n\nAnd you see it as a privilege to be consumed\n\n\n\nGive in to the pressure of the sound\n\nOf the voices saying step down\n\nTell us something that resembles truth\n\nYou pitiful bastard in clearest sight\n\n\n\nThe wolf was never hiding\n\nYou told yourself sweet nothings, and now your only truth is lying\n\nBulbous parasite; expanding from the blood of the ignorant\n\nThe worm is robbing our ability to communicate\n\nI saw him laugh in your face, why aren't you irate?\n\n\n\nScrub away the stain\n\nLeech their energy\n\n\n\nGive in to the pressure of the sound\n\nOf the voices saying step down\n\nTell us something that resembles truth\n\nYou pitiful bastard in clearest sight\n\nGive in to the pressure of the sound\n\nOf the voices saying step down\n\nTell us something that resembles truth\n\nYou pitiful bastard in clearest sight\n\n\n\nThe people's king; a virtuoso of trophy lust and adolescent behavior\n\nAn old fool convinced you he's your savior\n\nChaos is the grain on which the bastards feed\n\nBringing down the rain, they drown the land in greed\n\nScrub away the stain, leech their energy\n\nTell us something that resembles truth, just walk away"
