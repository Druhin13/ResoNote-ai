  "lyrics": "Last night I was on the selfish side of lonely when I called you\r\nI was weak, I knew damn well that you'd pick up\r\nWhen I told you that I missed you, I meant it\r\nBut we both know why we ended\r\nThere was nothing left to say\r\nSo I guess I'll take the blame\n\n\n\nGo ahead and hate me if you want to\n\nTell everybody that I did you wrong\n\nThat my blindsided slamming door came out of the blue\n\nAnd it was easy for me to just move on\n\nWhen the truth is that I loved you but you waited too long to fight\n\nYours ain't the only heart that broke that night\n\nBut since I'm the one who said goodbye\n\nYou can be the good man who was only trying to love me\n\nAnd I will be the bad guy\n\n\n\nCould've stayed yeah\n\nWhen you said that you'd do better\n\nAnd don't think I don't wonder\n\nWhen I'm lyin' here wide awake\n\nIf I quit too soon, but baby\n\nYeah deep down, I knew the only way was out\n\n\n\nSo go ahead and hate me if you want to\n\nTell everybody that I did you wrong\n\nThat my blindsided slamming door came out of the blue\n\nAnd it was easy for me to just move on\n\nWhen the truth is that I loved you but you waited too long to fight\n\nYours ain't the only heart that broke that night\n\nBut since I'm the one who said goodbye\n\nYou can be the good man who was only trying to love me\n\nAnd I will be the bad guy\n\n\n\nGo ahead and hate me if you want to\n\nTell everybody that I did you wrong\n\nThat my blindsided slamming door came out of the blue\n\nAnd it was easy for me to just move on\n\nWhen the truth is that I loved you but you waited too long to fight\n\nYours ain't the only heart that broke that night\n\nBut since I'm the one who said goodbye\n\nYou can be the good man who was only trying to love me\n\nAnd I will be the bad guy"
