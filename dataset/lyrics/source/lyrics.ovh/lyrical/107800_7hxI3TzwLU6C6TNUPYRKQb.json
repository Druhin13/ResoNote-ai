  "lyrics": "Tangled, tied up\r\nTwisted in so many ways\r\nI don't know how I got to this place\r\nThe pressure's building\r\nWeighing me down\r\nPinned to the ground\n\n\n\nBut I feel something shifting\n\nMy worries they're lifting\n\nBreak open the doors\n\nYou made me for\n\n\n\nFreedom\n\nNo more living in the dark\n\nNo more hiding from my heart afraid\n\n'Cause I am\n\nMeant to run just like a child\n\nLike a river rushing wild, always\n\nOh freedom\n\n\n\nIt's like finding\n\nGold that was there all along\n\nOr new words hiding in your favorite song\n\nI'm breathing\n\nSeeing the world with new eyes\n\nFinally alive\n\n\n\nOh freedom\n\nNo more living in the dark\n\nNo more hiding from my heart afraid\n\n'Cause I am\n\nMeant to run just like a child\n\nLike a river rushing wild, always\n\n\n\nHere in this moment\n\nThe world is wide open\n\nMy chains have been broken\n\nAnd now there's no going\n\nBack to before\n\nYou made me for freedom\n\n\n\nFreedom\n\nNo more living in the dark\n\nNo more hiding from my heart afraid\n\n'Cause I am\n\nMeant to run just like a child\n\nLike a river rushing wild, always\n\nOh freedom, freedom\n\nOh-oh-oh-ohh, freedom\n\nOhhhh, oh-ohhh, ohhh"
