  "lyrics": "The moment I wake up\r\nI say a little prayer for you\r\nWhile combing my hair, now\r\nAnd wonder what dress to wear, now\r\nI say a little prayer for you\n\nForever, forever, you'll stay in my heart\n\nAnd I will love you\n\nForever, and ever, we never will part\n\nOh, how I'll love you\n\nTogether, together, that's how it must be\n\nTo live without you\n\nWould only mean heartbreak for me\n\n\n\nI run for the bus, dear\n\nWhile riding I think of us, dear\n\nI say a little prayer for you\n\nAt work, I just take time\n\nAnd all through my coffee break-time\n\nI say a little prayer for you\n\n\n\nForever, forever, you'll stay in my heart\n\nAnd I will love you\n\nForever, and ever, we never will part\n\nOh, how I'll love you\n\nTogether, together, that's how it must be\n\nTo live without you\n\nWould only mean heartbreak for me\n\n\n\nI say a little prayer for you\n\nAt work, I just take time\n\nAnd all through my coffee break-time\n\nI say a little prayer for you\n\nForever, and ever, you'll stay in my heart\n\nAnd I will love you\n\nForever, and ever, we never will part\n\nOh, how I'll love you\n\nTogether, together, that's how it must be\n\nTo live without you\n\nWould only mean heartbreak for me\n\n\n\nMy darling, believe me\n\nFor me there is no one, no body but you\n\nPlease love me, too\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nAnswer my prayer\n\nNo body but you\n\nPlease love me, too\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nAnswer my prayer"
