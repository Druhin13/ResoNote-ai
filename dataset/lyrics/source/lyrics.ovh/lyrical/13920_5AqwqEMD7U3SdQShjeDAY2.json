  "lyrics": "Underneath the moon I've called a thousand different names\r\nNone of them ever answer me back\r\nIn the night time I know\r\nA familiar kind of peace\r\nOh, like it's something I used to have.\n\nI'm poised in a proposition I don't know\n\nAny detail...\n\nI'm caught in a mess hall that I can't keep\n\nHealthy and clean, ooo...\n\nLay beside the river bed and maybe I will sleep.\n\nOh, if my mind could just forget.\n\nI spend so much time focused on how I should remember\n\nOh, what a burden that has been\n\nI'm born in a body that I can't stand...\n\nUp straight.\n\nI'm caught in a situation I don't know,\n\nHow I got in to.\n\nOh I live in a home without any doors...\n\nFree me, free me ohhh\n\n\n\nThe river is building the flow\n\nIt's growing as high as it will go\n\nBending and twisting, oh oh oh\n\nStorm isn't over, no.\n\nThe storm isn't over, no...\n\nKos the storm isn't over, oh.\n\nOh no oh love,\n\nI was buried in it all.\n\nOh love,\n\nI was buried in it all.\n\n\n\nLay down, lay down.\n\nLay down, ohhh ohh ohhh oh\n\nLay down, lay down.\n\nLay down, ohhh ohh...\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Jessica Sage for these lyrics)"
