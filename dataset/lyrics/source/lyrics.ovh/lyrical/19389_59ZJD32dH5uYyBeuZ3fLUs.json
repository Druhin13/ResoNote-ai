  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ice Cream par Derrival\r\nYou said “We’re moving at a comfortable pace,”\nYou said “You’re doing it right, yeah, you’re doing it right,”\nBut I still feel like we’re in the same place,\nAre we doing it right?\nAre we doing it right, y’know?\nEveryone has their own two cents,\nEveryone has a different\nidea of what they think is right,\nBut are we doing it right, are we doing it right?\n\nYou make me melt like ice-cream\nWake me up from this daydream\n\nI can’t go back,\n\nTo where it is that we came from,\nI can’t go back,\nDoing things that satisfy some,\nLeave my past at the door,\nCause I don’t need it anymore no,\nI can’t go back.\n\nNot everyone is supportive of this so are you ready to fight?\nAre you ready to fight?\nCause I know when we succeed they’ll see it in a new light, see it in a new light,\nEveryone has their own beliefs,\nEveryone has war and peace,\nI hope you know what you got into cause I’m ready to fight, yeah I’m ready to fight.\n\nYou make me melt like ice-cream\n\nWake me up from this daydream\n\nI can’t go back,\nTo where it is that we came from,\nI can’t go back,\nDoing things that satisfy some,\nLeave my past at the door,\nCause I don’t need it anymore no,\nI can’t go back.\n\nWho’s to say\nWhat we can do?\nThere’s nothing\nWe’re trying to prove,\nWho’s to say\nWhere we can go?\nBut there’s nothing.\n\n\nI can’t go back,\nTo where it is that we came from,\nI can’t go back,\nDoing things that satisfy some,\nLeave my past at the door,\nCause I don’t need it anymore no,\nI can’t go back.\n\nI can’t go back"
