  "lyrics": "How much more are we gonna take\r\nHow many nights do we have to lie awake\r\nHow many tears are we gonna cry\r\nWe can wish until the well runs dry\n\nBut what happens when the sky above\n\nRuns out of every single shooting star\n\nAnd what if every good intention's only meant\n\nTo go so far\n\n\n\nOnly love, only love can save us now\n\nKeep the world from burning down, down, down\n\nTo the ground, ground, ground\n\nOnly love, can look inside a human heart\n\nAnd see us for who we are\n\nAnd who we are would be enough\n\n\n\nIf only there was only love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\n\n\nHow many lessons have we really learned\n\nHow many bridges could we cross instead of burned\n\nWhy do we find it hard to forgive\n\nWe're so blinded that it's easy to forget\n\n\n\nOnly love, only love can save us now\n\nKeep the world from burning down, down, down\n\nTo the ground, ground, ground\n\nOnly love, can look inside a human heart\n\nAnd see us for who we are\n\nAnd who we are would be enough\n\n\n\nIf only there was only love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\nOnly love\n\n\n\nSo what happens when the sky above\n\nRuns out of every single shooting star\n\nAnd what if every good intention's only meant\n\nTo go so far\n\n\n\nOnly love, only love can save us now\n\nKeep the world from burning down, down, down\n\nTo the ground, ground, ground\n\nOnly love, can look inside a human heart\n\nAnd see us for who we are\n\nAnd who we are would be enough\n\nIf only there was only love"
