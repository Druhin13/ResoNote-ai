  "lyrics": "I feel it move, I feel it ache\r\nIt's sad to see how much you change\r\nI slip into a cold lake\r\nNow I just feel it slip away\r\nInto a light\n\nThat I once knew\n\nI swam deep\n\nAnd thought of you\n\n\n\nI like the thought you think of me\n\nIt softer as I start to sink\n\nThe trees were sex, an orange sky\n\nIt is so sad to say goodbye\n\n\n\nInto a light\n\nThat I once knew\n\nI swam deep\n\nAnd thought of you"
