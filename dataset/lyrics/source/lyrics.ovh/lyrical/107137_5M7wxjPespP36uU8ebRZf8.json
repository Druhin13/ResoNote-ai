  "lyrics": "One of these days, I'm gonna take mine back\r\nI fell forever just to watch us slack\r\nAll of the days of working in the sun\r\nMy hands remind me of every hole I dug\r\nI said, hey, I'm all cried out\n\nHey, I'm all tired out\n\nYou'll climb out\n\nWhen you find your own way\n\n\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nThey say sometimes\n\nWhat you need is exactly what you fear\n\n\n\nOne of these days, I'll take it on my way\n\nOne of these nights, I'll leave it somewhere babe\n\nTalk of days and night and what you want\n\nYou say forever, then it's way too long\n\n\n\nI said hey, hey baby\n\nThe nights turned to dawn and we're standing\n\nIn the shadows baby\n\nWhere we turn to face the sun\n\n\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\n\n\nI said, hey, I'm all cried out\n\nHey, I'm all tired out\n\nAnd you'll climb out\n\nWhen you're finding your way\n\n\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nI'll say it louder, say it clear\n\nThey say sometimes\n\nWhat you need is exactly what you fear"
