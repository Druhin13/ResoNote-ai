  "lyrics": "Yup, this is a re-introduction plus some practical\nperspective\nFor those of us indeed who are in need of complete vision\ncorrection\nThe only thing that's required is a lens that's genuinely\nobjective\n\nAnd a minute of your time to wrap your mind around divine\n\nperception\n\nBecause even the most mindless and spiritually blind can be\n\nthe spectator\n\nIn the theatre of God's magnificent design, if you would\n\nincline\n\nYour ears and your eyes to these sounds and these signs\n\nWe would attempt to rightly refine and align your crooked\n\nsight\n\nBut we're not implying that a sunset or an ocean can begin\n\nto set in mind\n\nWhat the Son of Man began to set in redemptive motion\n\nBut morals, meaning and devotion, heart, mind and emotion\n\nSubstance, significance and truth cannot be explained\n\nOr reduced to a big bang explosion\n\nBecause His character and nature cannot be known through\n\nnatural revelation\n\nOr shown through random acts or figments of your imagination\n\nWe, the Beautiful Eulogy, attempt to communicate audibly\n\nAnd visually to help you hear and see the glory of God\n\nclearly\n\n\n\nMy life is in the hands of Your love everlasting\n\nI start where I finish, pick it back up where I left it\n\nI'm just a man of unclean lips, I've only seen a glimpse\n\nBut everywhere I look I see His finger prints, all things\n\nwere made through Him\n\nWe received His revelation so we reflect it when we breathe\n\nAnd the concepts we conceive are born of spiritual seed\n\nManifest in the material realm as musical composition\n\nThe rhythm of heart beats transformed by the Gospel and\n\nGodly wisdom\n\nI'm an instrument of His mercy\n\nUnworthy but still He uses me the Beauty of the Eulogy\n\nThrough His death we are truly free, free indeed\n\nThe condemnation and the bondage of our sin was abolished\n\nOn the cross and He alone accomplished it\n\nGod made Himself known exposing His own nature and His glory\n\nThrough His Son\n\nThe revelation of Our Saviour the fullness of God born in\n\nhuman form\n\nDeity in the flesh we need the Spirit\n\nAnd the Word to open our eyes so we can see correct; the\n\nVital Lens"
