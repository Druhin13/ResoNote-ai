  "lyrics": "It could be my delusion\r\nI would paint it in colors bold\r\nIf i could capture illusion\r\nI would hang it up on my wall\r\nIf i could be something other\r\nI would slip right inside your skin\n\nSee the world as another\n\nSee the world as i never did\n\n\n\nI thought as black as blood is blue\n\nIt's over the radio\n\nMy heart as black as blood is blue\n\n[?] a place to go\n\n[?] to hide from the light of electric soul\n\nThe light of an electric soul\n\n\n\nSomething [?]\n\nSomething about those threatening\n\nHold your hand like a razor\n\nCall it love but it is cutting me\n\n\n\nI thought as black as blood is blue\n\nIt's over the radio\n\nMy heart as black as blood is blue\n\n[?] a place to go\n\nThere's nowhere to run\n\nFrom the light of electric soul\n\nThe light of an electric soul\n\n\n\nHere I, here I\n\n\n\nI thought as black as blood is blue\n\nIt's over the radio\n\nMy heart as black as blood is blue\n\n[?] a place to go\n\nThere's nowhere to hide\n\nFrom the light of electric soul\n\nNowhere to hide to hide\n\nFrom the light of an electric soul\n\nNowhere to hide\n\nFrom the light of electric soul\n\nFrom the light of electric soul\n\nFrom the light of electric soul\n\nFrom the light of electric soul"
