  "lyrics": "He came by in his funeral suit\r\nIn an open hearted shade of blue\r\nAsked me what I like to do\r\nOn a July evening\r\nTo bermondsey or to shoreditch\n\nI said I don't know which is which\n\nThe night a thread for him to stitch\n\nFor me, the unbelieving\n\nIn the end we just stay in\n\nAnd gesture with our mugs of gin\n\nDance around this borrowed kitchen\n\nA stop and start dumb snow\n\n\n\nI am a cloud filament\n\nWe advance in tender increments\n\nBetween the past and future tense\n\nTest the weight of both"
