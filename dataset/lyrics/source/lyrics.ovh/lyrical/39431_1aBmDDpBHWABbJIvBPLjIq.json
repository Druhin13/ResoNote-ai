  "lyrics": "Imaginations of wonder, falling with and against all pressure\r\nDreaming of nothing\r\nJust a classic distraction from my everything\r\nShe said \"I think you're incredible”\r\nI can't believe it's true\r\nThe heart does deceive\n\nDreaming of someone\n\nJust a constant reminder there’s a ‘we' for me to complete\n\nDon’t you fight it, when you’re searching to belong\n\nTo belong\n\nIf you were you and I was me\n\nIf you were you and I was me\n\nDreaming of nothing\n\nI’m just dreaming of nothing"
