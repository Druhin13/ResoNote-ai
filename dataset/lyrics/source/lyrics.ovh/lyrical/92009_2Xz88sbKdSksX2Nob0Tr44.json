Well, hell no, I won't\n\n\n\nI'm cookin' up my own flavor\n\nEven if it ain't your style\n\nYou only see one layer\n\nOriginal could take a while\n\nMaking a mess, straight out of scratch\n\nThink what you think about that (What you think about that)\n\nOh, I'm just trying to make good a little bit greater\n\nI'm cookin' up my own flavor (Hey)\n\nOh, I'm cookin' up my own flavor\n\n\n\nAh yeah\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\nOne layer, one layer"
