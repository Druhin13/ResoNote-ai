  "lyrics": "The caution tape that you’ve wrapped around my brain\r\nHas continued to stay as I’m waiting for a break\r\nConstantly connecting dots\r\nTrying my best, consuming facts\r\nAll I’ve learned what’s done is done\r\nAnd you can not change the past\n\nHelping or hurting?\n\nI am numb\n\nI haven’t felt anything in days\n\nConfusion is key as I am locked inside\n\nOr am I just really gone?\n\n\n\nThe caution tape wrapped around my brain\n\nHas continued to stay\n\nA constant strain right behind my face\n\nI’m still waiting for a slight break\n\nFor a slight break\n\n\n\nAnd I know we’re just different\n\nI know we're just different\n\nKeep drinking from the same cup\n\nIt’ll fill you up\n\nIt’ll keep you numb\n\nSimplify the motions\n\nCounteract the movements\n\nDon’t think twice because this is love\n\nThis is love\n\nThis is love\n\n\n\nThe caution tape wrapped around my brain\n\nHas continued to stay\n\nA constant strain right behind my face\n\nI’m still waiting for a slight break\n\n\n\nYou are caffeine in my bloodstream\n\nYou are the energy hidden in between two muscles sleeping\n\nPlease don’t wake me up\n\nI miss myself too much\n\nI miss myself too much\n\nI miss myself too much\n\nSo please don't wake me up\n\nDon't wake me up\n\n\n\n'Cause all I have is patience\n\nWe all lose strength someday\n\nI’ve been waiting for a slight break"
