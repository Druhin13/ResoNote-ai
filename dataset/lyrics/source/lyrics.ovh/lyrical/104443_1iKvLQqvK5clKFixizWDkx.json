  "lyrics": "A coma might feel better than this, \nAttempting to discover where to begin.\r\nYou're weighed down, you're full of something.\r\nOf sickness, and desertion.\r\nYou're weighed down, you're full of something, \nYou're underneath it all.\n\n\n\nSo say goodbye to love, \n\nAnd hold your head up high.\n\nThere's no need to rush\n\nWe're all just waiting, waiting to die.\n\n\n\nHoping a better place is all I need, \n\nWith moments of innocence and mystery.\n\nOh, it's the little things you miss.\n\nLike waking up all alone.\n\nOh, it's the little things you miss, \n\nWhen you're underneath it all.\n\n\n\nSo say goodbye to love, \n\nAnd hold your head up high.\n\nThere's no need to rush\n\nWe're all just waiting, waiting to die.\n\n\n\nAll your friends seem like enemies\n\nWhen you're broken down and empty.\n\nAll your friends seem like enemies\n\nWhen you're broken down and empty.\n\n\n\nSo say goodbye to love, \n\nAnd hold your head up high.\n\nThere's no need to rush\n\nWe're all just waiting, waiting to die."
