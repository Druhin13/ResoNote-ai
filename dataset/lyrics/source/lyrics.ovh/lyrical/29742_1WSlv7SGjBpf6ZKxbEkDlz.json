  "lyrics": "In the land of the lost, we lay down law\r\nChopping off your head to take your face on tour\r\nLacerate your lips, then we shave off more\r\nElectrocute your body through the encore\r\nWhen the cops come and try to raid the jams\r\nI change my physical form to that of a ram\n\nAlakazam, I'm half of a man\n\nThe other part of me operates robotically\n\nPsychology is the dominant factor\n\nBelieve in the holograms and step in the backdoor\n\nOut for A.M. , more meyhem\n\nFive fatal steps to death unless we trace them\n\nFive: hesitate to get live\n\nYour career's postmortem, now you can't survive\n\nFour: perpetuate the folklore\n\nLive a lie, can't identify yourself no more\n\nThree: call yourself an MC\n\nPractice minimally and start fucking with me\n\nOr the [?] sorcery to the ultimate degree\n\nW-A-R W-M-D\n\nC-W-O fall in love with the dough\n\n'Til your spiritual essence is something you don't know about\n\nBag 'em up, throw 'em out via the frontdoor\n\n(Six million ways to die) There's one more\n\nLive healthily thinking you could extend that\n\nAs long as you remember that life is a deathtrap\n\nOops, didn't mean to spill the beans\n\nAnd kill your dreams, push you through the guillotine\n\nWe [?] your time, show me official design\n\nSit in a shrine, float in a robe with [?]shine\n\nAdorn by the dorn we reflect what's going on\n\nWe store water images and mirrors in our palms\n\n\n\nHalf the time they don't rhyme, half the time they all lying\n\nHalf the time they all mine, half the time they all yours\n\nHalf the time we on tour\n\nHalf the time they don't rhyme, half the time they all lying\n\nHalf the time they all mine, half the time they all yours\n\nHalf the time we on tour"
