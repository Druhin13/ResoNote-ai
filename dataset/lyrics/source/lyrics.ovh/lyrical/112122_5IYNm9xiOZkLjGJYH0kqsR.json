  "lyrics": "Tell 'em 'bout it\r\nYou know the blind lead the blind, don't let 'em misguide you\r\nKnow these niggas been bleedin' the stoop for a lifetime man\r\nGot nothin' goin' on, if it ain't beneficial, it's artificial\r\nI know it get slimy out here, gotta keep one up top\r\nIt's mad niggas gettin' picked off, yo\n\nKnow I wanna see a nigga prosper, G-O-D\n\nBreathe easy though, for real\n\nBulletproof\n\n\n\nShit ain't the same, niggas done changed\n\nBlame it on me, success and the fame\n\nI become numb to the stress and the pain\n\nWay that I rock, it reflect on my gang\n\nPut some respect on my name\n\nPicked up a tool, put in work with that thing\n\nGranny woke up, went to work every day\n\nJust to bail her son out, seen her hurt every day\n\nSometimes I break down and pray\n\n'Member we cop and we break down the yay\n\nKick down the door and then split what we take\n\nRun that shit back, nigga break down and play\n\nSuckers slid through and we came out with K's\n\nKillers bite down when they come out the cage\n\nJumped off the porch, I was young for my age\n\nWith Flowers and Yak on my way to the grain\n\nLike I miss my nigga, why you let 'em get my niggas?\n\nWhy you let 'em get my nigga? Real hit stick nigga\n\nBack to back trip on you niggas, back to back trip on you niggas\n\nLike I miss my nigga, why you let 'em get my niggas?\n\nWhy you let 'em get my nigga? Real hit stick nigga\n\nBack to back trip on you niggas, back to back trip on you niggas\n\nPrometh' sipper, probably why the ho bitch trippin'\n\nNoddin' off, countin' out chicken, may the Lord be the witness\n\nDo it for the niggas in the slums, I don't just do it for the image\n\nYou know the Gangland drillin', Callahan things on deck\n\nAll type of Caddys and they say I didn't work for half a million\n\nTell that lil' nigga keep playin' with me, I'ma put a bag on the ceiling\n\n\n\nAs my guy Mozzy say, you know\n\nGod up top"
