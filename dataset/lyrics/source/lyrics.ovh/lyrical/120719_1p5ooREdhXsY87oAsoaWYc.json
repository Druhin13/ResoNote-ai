  "lyrics": "Hey I was just wondering if anyone was sitting here\r\nAnd if not, would it be okay if someone bought you a beer\r\nLet's say that someone wanted to dance\r\nWould he have any snowballin' hell of a chance\r\nTo get you out on the floor before this slow song ends\r\nYeah, I'm just asking for a friend\n\n\n\nHe ain't ever been any good at laying it all out on the line\n\nI swear down deep, believe me girl, he's a really good guy\n\nIf you can find it in your heart just to cut him some slack\n\nHe'd be johnny-on-the-spot here in two seconds flat\n\nYeah, he's holding his breath, come on give him a second with you\n\n\n\nYeah what do you say\n\nIt's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful\n\nWhat man wouldn't make you the love of his life\n\nHe'd be a fool, he'd be a fool\n\nJust one drink would sure mean a lot to him\n\nYeah, I'm just asking for a friend\n\n\n\nLet's say this friend of mine went and messed up real bad\n\nAnd he'd do anything in this world, girl, to get you back\n\nHey what kind of sorry would it take for a man to erase his worst mistake\n\nAnd would this even begin to make a dent\n\n\n\nYeah what do you say\n\nIt's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful\n\nWhat man wouldn't make you the love of his life\n\nHe'd be a fool, he'd be a fool\n\nI don't mean to ramble on like this\n\nHey I'm just asking for a friend\n\n\n\nYeah what if I told you he hadn't slept in weeks\n\nHe was standing right here in front of you instead of me\n\nIs there any way you could ever love him again\n\nJust asking for a friend"
