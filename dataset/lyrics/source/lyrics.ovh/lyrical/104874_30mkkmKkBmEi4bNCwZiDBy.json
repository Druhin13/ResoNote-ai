  "lyrics": "Hotels, midnight\r\nBlue dress, black tights\r\nSad girls, red lights\r\nWhite lies, red wine\r\nYou can't jump out of the car right now\n\nIf it's too damn far to walk alone\n\nHis hand on the wheel while the rain comes down\n\nAnd you don't have a cigarette to smoke\n\nIn a way he says he's sorry\n\nMakes you feel so small\n\nSo small\n\n\n\nTears fall, closed eyes\n\nOne kiss, goodbyes\n\nYou tell youself you gonna be alright\n\nWhite lies, red wine\n\n\n\nYou can't jump out of the car right now\n\nIf it's too damn far to walk alone\n\nHis hand on the wheel while the rain comes down\n\nAnd you don't have a cigarette to smoke\n\nIn a way he says he's sorry\n\nMakes you feel so small\n\n\n\nSmall enough to get out from under\n\nLonely love, do wanna find something better\n\nIf it were a movie, the music would swell\n\nAnd you'd slam the door and tell him to go to hell\n\nBut you won't, 'cause it's not\n\n\n\nYou can't jump out of the car right now\n\nIf it's too damn far to walk alone\n\nHis hand on the wheel while the rain comes down\n\nAnd you don't have a cigarette to smoke\n\nIn a way he says he's sorry\n\nMakes you feel so small\n\nSo small\n\n\n\nHotels, midnight\n\nBlue dress, black tights"
