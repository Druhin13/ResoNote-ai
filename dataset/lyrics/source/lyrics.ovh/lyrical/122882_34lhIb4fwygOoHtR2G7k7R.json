  "lyrics": "What a night\r\nThere's lovers on the left and to the right\r\nTangled up beneath the dancefloor lights\r\nEverybody's got somebody\r\nWhat a shame\r\nYou're all alone just sippin' on champagne\n\nLookin' like a picture in a frame\n\nAnd no one here has even got your name\n\n\n\nWe all know what it feels like\n\nWhen a hungry heart gets cold\n\nAnd barely gettin' through the night gets old\n\nAnd you look like you need someone\n\nBut darlin' I do too\n\nIs it alright if I come home with you\n\n\n\nIf you don't mind\n\nWell I'll sit down here and talk with you while\n\nYou can tell me your story, I'll tell you mine\n\nWe can drink and laugh and listen to the band\n\nAnd maybe once we're tipsy we can dance\n\nAnd everyone will think that I'm your man\n\nLet's take a chance\n\n\n\n'Cause we all know what it feels like\n\nWhen a hungry heart gets cold\n\nAnd barely gettin' through the night gets old\n\nAnd you look like you need someone\n\nBut darlin' I do too\n\nIs it alright if I come home with you\n\nYeah you\n\nWith you\n\nYeah you\n\n\n\nIt's gettin' late\n\nAnd girl I know that look there on your face\n\n\n\n'Cause we all know what it feels like\n\nWhen a hungry heart gets cold\n\nAnd barely gettin' through the night gets old\n\nAnd you look like you need someone\n\nBut darlin' I do too\n\nIs it alright if I come home\n\nNo I don't wanna be alone\n\nIs it alright if I come home with you\n\nWith you\n\nYeah you"
