  "lyrics": "If I can feel you coming through all the static\r\nWon’t you open up your hands\r\nFall into loose form\r\nI’ve brought your echo along with me\r\nLucid I’m trailing behind\n\nFamiliar waves catch up with me now\n\n\n\nFlesh and Earth be your holding cell\n\nIn time your stale rhythm will stall\n\nHands of space they pull you in line\n\n\n\nNow we’re standing at the edge\n\nWaiting for your sick release\n\nNew eyes are staring at your soul\n\nBurning\n\n\n\nIf I can feel you coming through\n\nAll the static, won’t you open up your hands\n\n\n\nFall into loose form\n\nBuried in a garden of sand\n\n\n\nI can feel you coming through the static\n\nWon’t you open up your hands\n\n\n\nFall into loose form\n\nFalling\n\n\n\nNow we’re standing at the edge\n\nWaiting for your sick release\n\nNew eyes are staring at your soul\n\nReconcile with tongue and beasts\n\n\n\nFloating heavy towards the sun\n\nHeld up in a hollow sky\n\nFloating heavy towards the sun\n\nStill can’t see the light\n\n\n\nBut I don’t wanna come back\n\nI don’t wanna fall\n\nNo, I don’t wanna come back\n\nStatic hides it all\n\n\n\nI searched forever for an answer, don’t you understand\n\nYet I’m still talking to myself and myself never ends\n\nCaught me pleading for a meaning to your vicious plan\n\nYet I’m still talking to myself and myself never ends"
