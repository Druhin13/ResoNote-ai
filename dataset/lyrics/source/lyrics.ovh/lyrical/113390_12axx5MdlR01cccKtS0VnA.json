  "lyrics": "The story of my life\r\nIs very plain to read\r\nIt starts the day you came\r\nAnd ends the day you leave\r\nThe story of my life\n\nBegins and ends with you\n\nThe names are still the same\n\nAnd the story's still the truth\n\n\n\nI was alone\n\nYou found me waiting\n\nAnd made me your own\n\nI was afraid\n\nThat somehow I never could be\n\nThe man that you wanted of me\n\n\n\nYou're the story of my life,\n\nAnd every word is true\n\nEach chapter sings your name\n\nEach page begins with you\n\n\n\nIt's the story of our times\n\nAnd never letting go\n\nAnd if I die today,\n\nI wanted you to know\n\n\n\nStay with me here\n\nShare with me, care with me\n\nStay and be near\n\nAnd when it began\n\nI'd lie awake every night\n\nJust knowing somewhere deep inside\n\nThat our affair just might write\n\n\n\nThe story of my life\n\nIs very plain to read\n\nIt starts the day you came\n\nIt ends the day you leave"
