  "lyrics": "I have come to this place in my life\r\nI'm full but I've not satisfied\r\nThis longing to have more of You\r\nI can feel it my heart is convinced\r\nI'm thirsty my soul can't be quenched\r\nYou already know this but still\n\nCome and do whatever You want to\n\n\n\nI'm standing knee deep but I'm out where never been\n\nI feel You coming and I hear Your voice on the wind\n\n\n\nWould you come and tear down the boxes that I have tried to put You in\n\nLet love come teach me who You are again\n\nTake me back to the place where my heart was only about You\n\nAnd all I wanted was just to be with You\n\nCome and do whatever You want to\n\n\n\nFurther and further my heart moves away from the shore\n\nWhatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours\n\nFurther and further my heart moves away from the shore\n\nWhatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours\n\n[x2]\n\n\n\nThen You crash over me and I've lost control but I'm free\n\nI'm going under, I'm in over my head\n\nAnd You crash over me, I'm where You want me to be\n\nI'm going under, I'm in over my head\n\nWhether I sink, whether I swim\n\nIt makes no difference when I'm beautifully in over my head\n\nWhether I sink, whether I swim\n\nIt makes no difference when I'm beautifully in over my head\n\nI'm Beautifully in over my head\n\nI'm Beautifully in over my head"
