  "lyrics": "Some say it ain't over till it's over\r\nBut I guess it's really over now\r\nThere's something I gotta say before I let you go\r\nListen...\r\nCan't believe what's goin' on\n\nGotta keep my cool, be calm\n\nWhen I heard you and he was screamin' out of control\n\nAll I can think about is \"No, no, no... he won't\n\nhurt the one I've cared for so long, long... Hell, no.\"\n\nI know we're done, and now it's none of my concern but how\n\ncan two be windin' out from only weeks in goin' out\n\nJust makes me feel that what we had was real\n\nCould it be or is it too late? (Oh, oh baby)\n\n\n\nBaby!\n\nListen to your heart, won't let you down\n\nCause you should be my Lady!\n\nNow that we're apart love will show how\n\nLife carries on...\n\n\n\nI've never felt so strong\n\nLife can lead us to a happiness never ending\n\nIf we just know that we belong to each other\n\nNever worry, grow as we go\n\nSee you in your wedding dress\n\nI can see you in your wedding dress\n\nI see you walking down in your ... (wedding dress)\n\nI can see you in your wedding dress (Oh, yea~)\n\n\n\nI was never perfect no\n\nBut I'd never let it go to a point I'm ragin', throwin' making you uncomfortable\n\nWhat he didn't, did to you was unacceptable\n\nYou claimed everything was okay. That's impossible\n\nJust know I'm here for you\n\nAll clear for you from night to sun\n\nGod, I've been near to you, the feel of you gives me a rush\n\nIt makes me feel that what we have is real\n\nIt could never be too late oh yeah yeah\n\n\n\nBaby!\n\nListen to your heart, won't let you down\n\nCause you should be my Lady!\n\nNow that we're apart love will show how\n\nLife carries on...\n\n\n\nI've never felt so strong\n\nLife can lead us to a happiness never ending\n\nIf we just know that we belong to each other\n\nNever worry, grow as we go\n\nSee you in your wedding dress\n\nI can see you in your wedding dress\n\nI see you walking down in your ... (wedding dress)\n\nI can see you in your wedding dress (Oh, yea~)\n\n\n\nBaby girl you won't regret\n\nCome along just take my hand\n\nLet's start this journey livin' life so beautiful\n\nThis happy hope that we spread, love and see\n\nIt goes deeper so deep from my heart (Whoa oh oh oh oh)\n\n\n\nI've never felt so strong\n\nLife can lead us to a happiness never ending\n\nIf we just know that we belong to each other\n\nNever worry, grow as we go\n\nSee you in your wedding dress\n\nI can see you in your wedding dress\n\nNever let go... never let go\n\noh yeah"
