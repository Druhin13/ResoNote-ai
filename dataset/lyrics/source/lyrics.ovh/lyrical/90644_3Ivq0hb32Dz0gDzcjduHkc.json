  "lyrics": "Just because I wander 'round the places we would go\r\nHoping that I'd run into you one last time\r\nJust because I never took your picture off my phone\r\nDoesn't mean that you're still on my mind\r\nJust because I accidentally slipped and said your name\n\nWell I heard your song, it makes me insecure\n\nJust because I know I'll never ever feel the same\n\nDoesn't mean I love you anymore\n\n\n\nAm I lying to myself again\n\nWhen I say you're not the best I've ever had\n\nAm I lying to myself again\n\nWhen I say that I'm not missing you so bad\n\n\n\nJust because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change\n\nAnd I'd do anything to hear you say \"I'm yours\"\n\nJust because I know I'll never ever feel the same\n\nDoesn't mean I love you anymore\n\n\n\nAm I lying to myself again\n\nWhen I say you're not the best I've ever had\n\nAm I lying to myself again\n\nWhen I say that I'm not missing you so bad\n\n\n\nJust because I'm on my knees and swearing I would change\n\nAnd do anything to hear you say \"I'm yours\"\n\nJust because I know I'll never ever feel the same\n\nDoesn't mean I love you anymore, more\n\nDoesn't mean I love you anymore (anymore, anymore)\n\nDoesn't mean I love you anymore"
