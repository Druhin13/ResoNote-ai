  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Tripping Along par The Decemberists\r\nWe were tripping tripping tripping tripping tripping along\nWhile you're orbiting, might I?\nWhile you're orbiting, might I?\nLick you sticky sticky sticky sticky sticky and sweep\nThey're all turning a blind eye\nThey're all turning a blind eye\n\nBut oh what I'd do just to lie with you die in your arms\nWhat wouldn't I give just to live with that sense of alarm?\nBut your relatives gathered all clamber about for your mind\nAnd they're tearing and swearing to leave you all naked and blind\n\n\nSo we keep a-ripping ripping ripping ripping rips in the sheets\n'Till it's all coming undone\n'Till it's all coming undone\nAnd we're drippy drippy drippy drippy, what messes are we?\nAnd I'm due for a line out\nAnd I'm due for a light out\n\nBut just as I'm cusping on slumber and dumbing my eyes\nWhat spin-twisting vision comes listing and jelly alike?\nAnd bothering toddles all over this beautiful light\nThis fickle young sister's away in the dimming of night\n\n\nLa de da de da de da da da\nDa de da de da de da da da\nDa de da de da de da da da\nDa de da de da de da da da\nDa de da de da de da da da\nDa de da de da de da da da\nDa de da de da de da da da da"
