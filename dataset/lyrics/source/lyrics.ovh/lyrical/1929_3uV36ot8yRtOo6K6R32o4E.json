  "lyrics": "As the cafe was closing \non a warm summer night\r\nAnd Cathy was cleaning the spoons\r\nThe radio played the \"Hit Parade\"\r\nAnd I hummed a long with the tune\r\nShe asked me to change the station\n\nSaid the song just drove her insane\n\nBut it weren't just the music playing\n\nIt was me that she was trying to blame.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd the sky is black and still now\n\nOn the hill where the angels sing\n\nAin't it funny how an old broken bottle\n\nLooks just like a diamond ring\n\nBut it's far, far from me\n\n\n\nWell, I leaned on my left leg \n\nin the parking lot dirt\n\nAnd Cathy was closing the lights\n\nA June bug flew from the warmth he once knew\n\nAnd I wished for once I weren't right\n\nWhy we used to laugh together\n\nAnd we'd dance to any old song.\n\nWell, ya know, she still laughs with me\n\nBut she waits just a second too long.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nWell, I started the engine \n\nand I gave it some gas\n\nAnd Cathy was closing her purse\n\nWell, we hadn't gone far in my beat old car\n\nAnd I was prepared for the worst.\n\n\"Will you still see me tomorrow?\"\n\n\"No, I got too much to do.\"\n\nWell, a question ain't really a question\n\nIf you know the answer too.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:"
