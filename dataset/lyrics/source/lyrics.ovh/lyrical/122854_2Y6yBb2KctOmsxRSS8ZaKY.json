  "lyrics": "I saw a blind man,\r\nHe was a kind man,\r\nHelping a fellow along,\r\nOne could not see,\r\nOne could not walk,\r\nBut they both were humming this song;\n\n\n\nWhen you're smiling, When you're smiling, \n\nThe whole world smiles with you,\n\nWhen you're laughing, When you're laughing,\n\nThe sun comes shining through,\n\nBut when you're crying you bring on the rain,\n\nSo stop your sighing be happy again,\n\nKeep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,\n\nThe whole world smiles with you.\n\n\n\nI used to worry,\n\nI used to hurry,\n\nEach time it started to rain,\n\nNow I see light,\n\nLearned wrong from right,\n\nAnd you'll never hear me complain;\n\n\n\nWhen you're smiling, When you're smiling, \n\nThe whole world smiles with you,\n\nWhen you're laughing, When you're laughing,\n\nThe sun comes shining through,\n\nBut when you're crying you bring on the rain,\n\nSo stop your sighing be happy again,\n\nKeep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,"
