  "lyrics": "Shake it off.\r\nPick yourself up, they say.\r\nYour life fell apart in your hands, and you've got the scars to prove it.\r\nIt's not the first time, and they're getting deeper.\r\nPull it together.\r\nButton up your shirt.\n\nRoll down those sleeves.\n\nDon't let them see how you've coped.\n\nMore and more your demeanor looks like quicksand.\n\nIt seems like your giving up on everything you worked for.\n\nIt's pulling you under.\n\nIt's gripping around your throat.\n\nLife can be overwhelming,\n\nbut don't turn your back on the strongest crutch you've ever.\n\nThey have always been there to brace your fall.\n\nWave goodbye to the past.\n\nYou've got your whole life to lead.\n\nIt's time to gain some ground"
