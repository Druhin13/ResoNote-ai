  "lyrics": "My mistake\r\nThought this year would bring something different\r\nAnd I'm the same old story\r\nHaunted memories\r\nAll the way (all the way)\n\nAll the way from the warmth of your hands\n\nYou wouldn't even let me hold them\n\n\n\nAnother one\n\nSo over them\n\nKill me twice\n\nFinalize my shelf life\n\n\n\nNow you're alone\n\nDo you feel any better?\n\nLeft to commence\n\nWith a heavy head\n\n\n\n(Leave me)\n\nThe brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out\n\nGuzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around\n\nPayments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed\n\nI started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away\n\n\n\nPlease don't feel like\n\nI'm attacking you\n\nI did some things too\n\nAnd pushed you away\n\n\n\nIt needs to\n\nThe feelings of the past will surely fade through\n\nTo live another day\n\n\n\nLooks like I was someone I could barely recognize\n\nHope it's not too late to scatter this disguise\n\n\n\nMy mistake\n\nThought this year would bring something different\n\nAnd I'm the same old story\n\nHaunted memories\n\n\n\nAll the way (all the way)\n\nAll the way from the warmth of your hands\n\nYou wouldn't even let me hold them\n\n\n\n(Leave me)\n\nThe brightest of wizards I bit her and love came on gushing out\n\nGuzzled some lizards my skin turned to scale. Felt it wrap around\n\nPayments get vicious. Account gettin' roasted and flayed\n\nI started a party, and partied, and partied, and flew away"
