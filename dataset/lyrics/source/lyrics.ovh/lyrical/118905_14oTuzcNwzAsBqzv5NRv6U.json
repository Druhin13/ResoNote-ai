  "lyrics": "Somehow we lost our way\r\nI don’t know how we did it\r\nWe went so off course\r\nAnd now, you hide to numb your pain\r\nDoes this mean that we’re over?\r\nGotta let me know\n\n\n\nYeah the ball is rolling past the two of us\n\nBut your feet ain’t moving, are you cool with us?\n\nAnd I’m caught in your mind but it’s like you’ve had enough\n\nI wish you’d just tell me to go\n\n\n\nOh lay it on me yo, Oh lay it on me yo\n\nI’m saying\n\nWe’re caught in stone you know we might not make it\n\nOh lay it on me yo, Oh lay it on me yo I’m saying\n\nThis love is holding us but are we gonna make it?\n\n\n\nOh lay it on me yo, I’m saying\n\nOh lay it on me yo, but are we gonna make it?\n\n\n\nHow did I go wrong\n\nThought I’d belong, with you it’s right now\n\nI’m feeling afraid that I could lose you somehow\n\nAnd I’m paddling fast, faster than fast\n\nBut are we slowly sinking\n\nTell me what are you thinking?\n\n\n\nSee the ball is rolling past the two of us\n\nBut your feet ain’t moving, are you cool with us?\n\nAnd I’m caught in your mind but it’s like you’ve had enough\n\nI wish you’d just tell me to go\n\n\n\nOh lay it on me yo, Oh lay it on me yo\n\nI’m saying\n\nWe’re caught in stone you know we might not make it\n\nOh lay it on me yo, Oh lay it on me yo I’m saying\n\nThis love is holding us but are we gonna make it?\n\n\n\nOh lay it on me yo, I’m saying\n\nOh lay it on me yo, but are we gonna make it?"
