  "lyrics": "One night upon my motorcycle through the desert spead\r\nAnd smashed my body so that all my friends thought I was dead\r\nMy sister held me close and whispered to my bleeding head\r\n\"You are the son of a mother fucker\"\r\nOne two three four\n\n\n\nI shook all night and held her hand\n\nChocolate people well I'll be damned\n\nLand of plenty, land of fun\n\nTo find out I'm Nimrod's son\n\n\n\nOh bury me\n\nFar away please\n\nBury me\n\n\n\nHa-haaa\n\nThe joke has come upon me\n\n\n\nIn my motorcycle mirror I think about the life I've led\n\nAnd how my soul's been aking all the holes where I have bled\n\nMy image spoke to me, yes to me and often said\n\n\"You are the son of incestuous union\"\n\n\n\nOne two three\n\n\n\nNow my head is clear\n\nMy luke hands washed\n\nMy daughter's pure\n\nMy son is tall\n\nLand of plenty, land of fun\n\nTo find out I'm Nimrod's son\n\n\n\nOh bury me\n\nFar away please\n\nBury me\n\n\n\nHa-ha Ha-ha\n\nThe joke has come upon me"
