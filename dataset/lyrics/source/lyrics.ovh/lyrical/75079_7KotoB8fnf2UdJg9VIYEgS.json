  "lyrics": "Power, greed\r\nFace on the cover of a magazine\r\nStock, money roll\r\nYou can have it all\r\nIf you sell your soul\n\nWall Street, big game\n\nTake it down with your champagne\n\n\n\nFast cars, women\n\nHey man talk about living\n\n\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go You know\n\n\n\nDiamonds pearls\n\nFlying that jet all around the world\n\nYachts, caviar\n\nHangin' out with all the stars\n\nPenthouse on the 99th floor\n\nCan't get enough\n\nAlways gotta have more\n\nEndless party\n\nLiving wild and free\n\n\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go\n\n\n\nDelirious, serious\n\nA man with a plan\n\nYou got to understand\n\nThey dream big, not small\n\nIs there anybody out there doesn't want it all?\n\nDoesn't want it all\n\nDoesn't want it all\n\n\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go You know\n\n\n\nYou can't take it with you\n\nBut you can't have it all before you go"
