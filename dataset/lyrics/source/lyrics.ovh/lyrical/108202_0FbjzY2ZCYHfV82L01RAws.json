  "lyrics": "Seems like a dream now, it was so long ago \nThe moon burned so bright and the time went so slow \nAnd I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring \nThe bluebird was high on the wing \nWhatever happened to Saturday night \n\nFinding a sweetheart and holding her tight? \n\nShe said,'Tell me, oh, tell me, was I all right?' \n\nWhatever happened to Saturday night? \n\n\n\nThe years brought the railroad \n\nIt ran by my door \n\nNow there's boards on the windows \n\nAnd dust on the floor \n\nAnd she passes the time at another man's side \n\nAnd I pass the time with my pride \n\n\n\nWhat a tangled web we weave \n\nGo 'round with circumstance \n\nSomeone show me how to tell the dancer \n\nFrom the dance \n\n\n\nWhat ever happened \n\nTo Saturday night? \n\nChoosin' a friend and loosin' a fight \n\nShe said,'Tell me, oh, tell me, are you alright?' \n\nWhatever happened to Saturday night? \n\nWhatever happened to Saturday night?"
