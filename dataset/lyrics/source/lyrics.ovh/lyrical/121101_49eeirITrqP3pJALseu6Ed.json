Will you be my cherry?\r\nSo come on talk to me, talk to me\r\nWill you, will you be mine?\r\n1, 2, 3, let's go\n\n\n\nDown the subway, you looked my way\n\nWith your girl gaze, with your girl gaze\n\nThat was the day everything changed\n\nCouldn't stay the same\n\nNow it's Tuesday and I'm thinking\n\n'Bout to tuck in, 'bout to tuck in\n\nTelling myself that it's cheating\n\nBut it's something else\n\n\n\nEven though I'm satisfied\n\nI lead my life within a lie\n\nHolding onto feelings\n\nI'm not used to feeling\n\n'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive\n\n\n\nWhen they tell you that you've got to stay the same\n\nEven though you're not yourself\n\nAnd you've got somebody else\n\nWhen they tell you that you've got yourself to blame\n\nEven though it's not your fault\n\nBut your heart just wants to know, know\n\n\n\nDown the subway, you looked my way\n\nWith your girl gaze, with your girl gaze\n\nThat was the day everything changed\n\nNow it's something else\n\n\n\nEven though I'm satisfied\n\nI lead my life within a lie\n\nHolding onto feelings\n\nI'm not used to feeling\n\n'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive\n\n\n\nSo won't you? Will you be my cherry?\n\nSo come on, talk to me, talk to me\n\nWill you, will you be mine?\n\nI see you watching me, will you be mine baby?\n\nWill I be your cherry?\n\nSo come on, talk to me, talk to me\n\nWill you, will you be mine?\n\n\n\nWith one look you take me back to everything I used to be\n\nWhen everyone was seventeen with no ID, no ID\n\nLove no one and love myself\n\nIt's not that us is guaranteed\n\n'Cause inside I'm still the same me with no ID, no ID\n\nWon't you be my cherry now?\n\n\n\nEven though I'm satisfied\n\nI lead my life within a lie\n\nHolding onto feelings\n\nI'm not used to feeling\n\n'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive\n\n\n\nEven though I'm satisfied\n\nI lead my life within a lie\n\nHolding onto feelings\n\nI'm not used to feeling\n\n'Cause, oh, they make me feel alive\n\n\n\nSo won't you? Will you be my cherry?\n\nSo come on, talk to me, talk to me\n\nWill you, will you be mine?\n\nI see you watching me, will you be mine baby?\n\nWill I be your cherry?\n\nSo come on, talk to me, talk to me\n\nWill you, will you be mine?\n\nI see you watching me, watching me"
