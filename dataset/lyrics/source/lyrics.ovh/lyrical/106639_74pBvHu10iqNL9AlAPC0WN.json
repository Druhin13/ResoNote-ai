  "lyrics": "Chestnuts roasting on an open fire\r\nJack Frost nipping at your nose\r\nYuletide carols being sung by a choir\r\nAnd folks dressed up like Eskimos\r\nEverybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe\n\nHelp to make the season bright\n\nTiny tots with their eyes all aglow\n\nWill find it hard to sleep tonight\n\n\n\nThey know that Santa's on his way\n\nHe's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh\n\nAnd every mother's child is going to be spy\n\nTo see if reindeer really know how to fly\n\n\n\nAnd so, I'm offering this simple phrase\n\nTo kids from one to ninety-two\n\nAlthough it's been said many times, many ways\n\nMerry Christmas to you\n\n\n\nAnd so, I'm offering this simple phrase\n\nTo kids from one to ninety-two\n\nAlthough it's been said, many times, many ways\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nMerry Christmas to you\n\nMmm have a Merry Christmas now\n\nTo you\n\nMerry Christmas to you"
