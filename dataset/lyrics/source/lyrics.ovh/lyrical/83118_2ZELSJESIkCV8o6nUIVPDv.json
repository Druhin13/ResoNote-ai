  "lyrics": "What if our sights looked further away\r\nCould we make something else at the end\r\nEach place I've seen runs over the high\r\nWashed out like painted skies\r\nNow indeed I'm hosting you\n\nA choice [?]\n\nJump because you want to\n\nIt's only moving so far\n\n\n\nYou think it all gets easier\n\nNo fear of losing out again\n\nOur heart bears nothing else\n\nI've gotta do\n\nIt seems we're overqualified\n\nSometime I feel like I could improve\n\nWhatever helps you see the mind\n\n\n\nNow indeed I'm hosting you\n\nA choice [?]\n\nJump because you want to\n\nIt's only moving so far\n\n\n\n[?] you've always been\n\n[?] so calm\n\nCrimson like all\n\nThe eyes I know\n\n\n\n[?] up in this time, to kill\n\nOur hope forever blocks our arms\n\nOut here I'm vacant, shallow and poor\n\nThat's how we climb like burning air\n\n\n\nNow indeed I'm hosting you\n\nA choice [?]\n\nJump because you want to\n\nIt's only moving so far\n\n\n\n[?] is who you are\n\nIt's only moving so far"
