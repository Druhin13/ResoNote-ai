  "lyrics": "We could be free\r\nIf we only knew we were slaves to the plays of each other\r\nOne day, I believe I'd learn\r\nTo see my enemy as my brother\r\nThen we could be free, truly\r\nAnd love could wash away our sorrows\n\nI'm not afraid to bleed\n\nIf it means, we'll make them better today not tomorrow\n\n\n\nOne day I dream of telling my momma\n\n\"You ain't gotta work no more\"\n\nSame for my father, born in Ghana, down on that dirt road floor\n\nAs far as he came I can't complain, but pain is so subjective\n\nSpend so much time countin' issues, I forget to count\n\nMy blessings\n\nWatch my cousins back at home, getting water out a well\n\nWhile I watch my brother stacking stone, whippin' water by the scale\n\nTryna' get a mill' on the other side\n\nThey ain't got a meal, we don't recognize we in heaven\n\nSo we think we live in hell\n\nIt's been getting kinda hard to tell\n\nBut\n\n\n\nSometimes I wake up and I look up at the sky\n\nAsking why I'm alive when so many niggas died\n\nAnd my pride won't let me give up, lord as hard as I try\n\nIn those times I try to remember\n\n\n\nThat we could be free\n\nIf we only knew we were slaves to the plays of each other\n\nOne day, I believe I'd learn\n\nTo see my enemy as my brother\n\nThen we could be free, truly\n\nAnd love could wash away our sorrows\n\nI'm not afraid to bleed\n\nIf it means, we'll make them better today not tomorrow\n\n\n\nI don't want to wait for the afterlife\n\nI don't want a vigil by candle light\n\nI don't want to be the new sacrifice\n\nI don't want to turn into a poltergeist\n\nBe a ghost at night full of broken dreams\n\nMomma cryin' by an open casket\n\nCold as ice in a suit, 3 piece\n\nAll dressed up for Sunday masses\n\nPastor said put faith in God\n\nFaith in the lord can't make things right\n\nWho the fuck is you to patronize\n\nSomebody's son whose daddy died?\n\nWhy they flood Baton Rouge?\n\nWhy the city singing Alton's blues?\n\nWhy, why, why, why?\n\nI feel like Jadakiss every time I watch the news\n\nWhat the fuck I got to lose?\n\nSo I'm down to bleed if it means things improve\n\nYou fools, saying \"all lives matter\"\n\nBut it's black lives you refuse include\n\nBlocked from the polls\n\nLocked in the hood, trying to stop you from voting and stop you from growing\n\nAnd cops keep blowing and blowing\n\nKeep black people locked into cotton\n\nThey don't want you to own, but\n\n\n\nSometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky\n\nAsking why I survived all the days that I could have died\n\nWho am I in my place\n\nTo contemplate suicide?\n\nIn those times I try to remember\n\n\n\nThat we could be free, truly\n\nIf we'd only knew we were slaves to the plays of each other\n\nBut I believe I'd learn\n\nTo see my enemy as my brother\n\nThen we could be free, truly\n\nAnd we could wash away our sorrows\n\nI'm not afraid to bleed, if it means\n\nWe'll make them better today not tomorrow\n\n\n\nLove (love)\n\nLove (love)\n\nTo love my enemy as my brother\n\n(yeah yeah yeah)\n\nMake my enemy my brother\n\nWoah, oh, oh, oh\n\nEnemy my brother"
