Ya Learned Something.\n\nBut Even If The First Few Burst Through\n\nThey Only Pursue Cause They Wanna Hurt You.\n\nIt Comes With A Smokers Cough\n\nGonna Turn It On Until Its Broken Off.\n\nCause Suffered And Crushed Is Just Not Enough\n\nThey Wanna Hold You Down Until They Lock You Up.\n\n\n\n[Chorus x4]\n\n\n\nHey Sister, Don't Let Them Touch You,\n\nSo Friendly When They're Close Enough To Cut You.\n\n\n\nHey Mister, Don't Let Them Break You."
