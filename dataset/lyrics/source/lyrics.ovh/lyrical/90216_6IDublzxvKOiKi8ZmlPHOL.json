  "lyrics": "This isn't easy\r\nFor me to admit\r\nI got a fire inside and some words I know I can't keep in\r\nI see faith turning\r\nInto a show\r\nOf Sundays and sermons\n\nAnd words getting caught in the flow\n\n\n\nOh, but we got real pain and real fears\n\nThirsting for the drying of our real tears\n\nIt's not satisfying anymore\n\nAin't it true that the veil was torn\n\n\n\nI don't need no stained glass\n\nTo be washed in his blood\n\nI don't need no perfect, put together pretty words\n\nTo be enough, no\n\nI want Jesus and his real love\n\nSomething I crave deep inside of my bones\n\nSo you can leave your religion at home\n\n\n\nSpent my life trying\n\nTo keep all the rules\n\nNow I know it's about what he's already done\n\nNot about what I think that I gotta do\n\n\n\nI don't need no stained glass\n\nTo be washed in his blood\n\nI don't need no perfect, put together pretty words\n\nTo be enough, no\n\nI want Jesus and his real love\n\nSomething I crave deep inside of my bones\n\nSo you can leave your religion at home\n\n\n\nI want real, real love, hey\n\n\n\nI got real pain and real fears\n\nThirsting for the drying of real tears\n\nIt's not satisfying anymore\n\nAin't it true that the veil was torn\n\n\n\nI don't need no stained glass\n\nTo be washed in his blood\n\nI don't need no perfect, put together pretty words\n\nTo be enough, no\n\nI want Jesus and his real love\n\nSomething I crave deep inside of my bones\n\nSo you can leave your religion at home\n\n\n\nI want real, real love\n\nI want real, real love\n\nI want real, real love\n\nOh, yeÂ—yeah, yeah"
