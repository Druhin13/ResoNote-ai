  "lyrics": "I've been believing\r\nIn something so distant\r\nAs if I was human\r\nAnd I've been denying\r\nThis feeling of hopelessness\r\nIn me - in me\n\n\n\nAll the promises I made\n\nJust to let you down\n\nYou believed in me but I'm broken\n\n\n\nI have nothing left\n\nAnd all I feel is this cruel wanting\n\nWe've been falling for all this time\n\nAnd now I'm lost in paradise\n\n\n\nAs much as I'd like\n\nThe past not to exist\n\nIt still does\n\nAnd as much as I'd like\n\nTo feel like I belong here\n\nI'm just as scared as you\n\n\n\nI have nothing left\n\nAnd all I feel is this cruel wanting\n\nWe've been falling for all this time\n\nAnd now I'm lost in paradise\n\n\n\nRun away, run away\n\nOne day we won't feel this pain anymore\n\nTake it all away\n\nShadows of you\n\nCause they won't let me go\n\n\n\nTill I have nothing left\n\nAnd all I feel is this cruel wanting\n\nWe've been falling for all this time\n\nAnd now I'm lost in paradise\n\nAlone and lost in paradise"
