  "lyrics": "Every absent-minded day\r\nI let myself carried away\r\nThen you get 5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby\r\nKneeling down for all they cared\r\nYou let them pay and went ahead\n\nIt is still 5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby\n\n\n\nYou’re eager and unashamed\n\nI grieve by dying every night baby\n\nProve them wrong when you get\n\n5 dollars\n\n\n\nYou’re eager and unashamed\n\nI don’t think the race is over baby\n\nProve them wrong when you get\n\n5 dollars\n\n\n\nSome of us just had to fight\n\nFor even being looked at right\n\nThen you get 5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby\n\n\n\nPockets full and dried eyes\n\nIt turns me on because it’s timed\n\nNow throw me 5 dollars baby blues, 5 dollars baby\n\nThrow me 5 dollars baby\n\n\n\nYou’re eager and unashamed\n\nI grieve by dying every night baby\n\nProve them wrong when you get\n\n5 dollars\n\n\n\nYou’re eager and unashamed\n\nAnd I don’t think the race is over baby\n\nProve them wrong when you get\n\n5 dollars"
