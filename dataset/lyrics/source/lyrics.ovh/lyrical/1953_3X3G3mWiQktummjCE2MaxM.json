  "lyrics": "The last time that I saw her\r\nShe was standing in the rain\r\nWith her overcoat under her arm\r\nLeaning on a horsehead cane\r\nShe said \"Carl, take all the money\"\r\nShe called everybody Carl\n\n\"My spirit's broke\"\n\n\"My mind's a joke,\"\n\n\"And getting up's real hard\"\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nDon't you know her\n\nWhen you see her?\n\nShe grew up\n\nIn your back yard\n\nCome back to us\n\nBarbara Lewis\n\nHare Krishna\n\nBeauregard\n\n\n\nSelling bibles at the airports\n\nBuying Quaaludes on the phone\n\nHey, you talk about\n\nA paper route\n\nShe's a shut in without a home\n\nGod save her, please\n\nShe's nailed her knees\n\nTo some drugstore parking lot\n\nHey, Mr. Brown\n\nTurn the volume down\n\nI believe this evening's shot\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\n\n\nCan't you picture her next Thursday?\n\nCan you picture her at all?\n\nIn the Hotel Boulderado\n\nAt the dark end of the hall\n\nI gotta shake myself and wonder\n\nWhy she even bothers me\n\nFor if heartaches were commercials\n\nWe'd all be on T.V.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus"
