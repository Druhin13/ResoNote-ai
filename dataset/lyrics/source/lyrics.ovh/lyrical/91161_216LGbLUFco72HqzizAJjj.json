  "lyrics": "You're fighting battles and fighting wars\r\nYou storm my castle, I'll hold the doors\r\nWe are too fragile to fight for sport\r\nPlease see, I bleed for you\r\nAnd I bleed, I bleed for you\r\nAnd I bleed for you\n\n\n\nOur love's been caught in the crossfire\n\nBeen balancing on a hot wire\n\nPeace is just a distant memory\n\nWe sat down at the table with your daggers out\n\nJust sharpen the blades with the words from your mouth\n\nYou can't forgive if you can't forget\n\nA bloodstained battlefield has been our home for a while now\n\n\n\nWe're fighting battles and fighting wars\n\nYou storm my castle, I'll hold the doors\n\nWe are too fragile to fight for sport\n\nPlease see, I bleed for you\n\nAnd I bleed, I bleed for you\n\nAnd I bleed for you\n\n\n\nThe tension is too high to call a truce\n\nBut I can't take another bruise\n\nOr this vicious cycle anymore\n\nWe walked across the mention of thin ice\n\nTo know what flag that you need to sign\n\nAre we too prideful for mercy?\n\n\n\nYou're fighting battles and fighting wars\n\nYou storm my castle, I'll hold the doors\n\nWe are too fragile to fight for sport\n\nPlease see, I bleed for you\n\nAnd I bleed, I bleed for you\n\nAnd I bleed for you\n\n\n\nA bloodstained battlefield has been our home for a while now\n\nOur sweet surrender's sinking deeper while we drown\n\nI bleed for you\n\nA bloodstained battlefield has been our home for a while now\n\nOur sweet surrender's sinking deeper while we drown\n\nI bleed for you, I bleed for you\n\nI bleed for you, for you\n\n\n\nI bleed for you, I bleed for you\n\nI bleed for you, for you"
