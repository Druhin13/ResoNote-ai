  "lyrics": "I'm losing my faith though I was never religious\r\nLosing my patience while I pray for forgiveness\r\nWashing my hands but the water is wasted\r\nI tried a darker side and I liked how it tasted\r\nI tried to stay away from the dead and the living\r\nIt's hard to find an end when you have no beginning\n\nI'm burning in Hell, but I'm already in Heaven\n\nI'm going to war and I've chosen my weapon\n\n\n\nWill you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?\n\nBless my soul, even though I'm a sinner\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand\n\nWill you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?\n\nBless my soul, when you know I'm a sinner\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand\n\n\n\nThe night you were leaving, you gave me a mission\n\nYou opened my eyes and you showed me a vision\n\nI'm paving my way to get out of this prison\n\nA few wanna help and not a lot wanna listen\n\nI'm walking alone, and I can need a companion\n\nTo show me the wisdom, give me more understanding\n\nI scared 'em away, I'm always over-demanding\n\nBut I got a seed and it's in need of some planting\n\n\n\nWill you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?\n\nBless my soul, even though I'm a sinner\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand when you know I'm a sinner\n\nBless my soul, even though I'm a sinner\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand\n\n\n\nFather, ever since you left, I'm missing all my roots\n\nI can't see the bigger picture, I can't find the proof\n\nWe told so many lies in an attempt to tell the truth\n\nWe're given all the tools but we forgot their proper use\n\nI remember all the promises when they were made\n\nAnd I will take all of our secrets with me to the grave\n\nI'm waiting for the judgement that shall fall upon my head\n\nI hope someone is here to pray for me when I am dead\n\n\n\nWill you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?\n\nBless my soul, even though I'm a sinner\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand\n\nWill you hold my hand when you know I'm a sinner?\n\nBless my soul, even though I'm a sinner\n\nHold my hand\n\nHold my hand\n\n\n\nBless my soul\n\nHold my hand, hold my hand\n\nBless my soul\n\nHold my hand, hold my hand"
