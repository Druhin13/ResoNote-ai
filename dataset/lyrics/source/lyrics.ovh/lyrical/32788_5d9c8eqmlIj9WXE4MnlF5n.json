  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Hello Shadow par Skygge\r\nI am the shape of your whisper, I am\nThe whisper of a good man\nFilling the space where light goes missing\nThat I fill\nMissing where the mad went\n\nI don't miss my body, but it's not what I am\nI'm a shadow but far from another's, I am\nAt least you don't forget the whispers in my head\nI have done what no man shadow can\n\nWill you follow me good man\nWill you follow me-e good man?\nWill you follow me good man\nWill you follow me-e good man?\nWill you come down as I was?\n\nBe as I am?\nFollow me as you are\nBut I will say\n\nHello shadow (Did you, did you fall?)\n(Did you, did you, did you fall?)\nHello shadow (Did you, did you fall?)\n(Did you, did you, did you fall?)\nHello\nHello\nHello\n\nI am the face of a thousand centuries\nI don't want kingdoms and kings\nNow I am back from all my travels, you'll see\nTo be what you are to me\n\nI don't miss my body, but it's what I am\n\nI'm a shadow but far from another's I am\nAt least you don't forget the whispers in my head\nI have done what no man shadow can\n\nWill you follow me good man\nWill you follow me-e good man? (come on)\nWill you follow me good man\nWill you follow me-e good man?\nWill you come down as I was?\nBe as I am\nFollow me as you are\nBut I will say\n\nHello shadow (Did you, did you fall?)\n(Did you, did you, did you fall?)\nHello shadow (Did you, did you fall?)\n(Did you, did you, did you fall?)\nHello shadow (Did you, did you fall?)\n\n(Did you, did you, did you fall?)\nHello shadow (Did you, did you fall?)\n(Did you, did you, did you fall?)"
