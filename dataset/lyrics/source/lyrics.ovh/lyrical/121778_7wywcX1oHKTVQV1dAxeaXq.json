  "lyrics": "Me and Jesse stayed up ’til two\r\nWe talked about dreams about things, about you\r\nIt felt like anything could be real or fake\r\nLike our love is my world, but so is my heartache\r\nAnd I knew\n\nIf I thought really hard about flying\n\nI could probably do\n\nIt I’m just too tired for trying\n\n\n\nI created a scorpion\n\nAnd then had to kill it\n\nJust like I loved you\n\nAnd I had to will it\n\n\n\nTo end\n\n‘Cause I bent the rules and I’m scary\n\nMy dream\n\nIs to see the world that I’m wearing\n\n\n\nI’ll have to break our deepest hopes\n\nThey keep you in shape\n\nToo late to explain\n\nHow many things of whole and good\n\n\n\nThe mirror\n\nGlittered all blue and silver\n\nBut I was never\n\nIn it to begin with\n\n\n\nI like to be a shadow\n\nIn a shadow\n\nMore deep when visible\n\nThan invisible\n\n\n\nOh to be\n\nThe heart of the scenery\n\nOh to be\n\nFilled with apathy\n\nOh to be\n\nA little bit scared of me"
