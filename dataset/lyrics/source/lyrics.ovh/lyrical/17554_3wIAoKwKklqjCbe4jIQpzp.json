  "lyrics": "Over there, just beneath the moon,\r\nThere's a man with a burden to keep,\r\nNow sleep will fall, washouts, rags and paperbags\r\nHomes and lives passing by.\r\n[Chorus]\n\nWho will see the beauty in your life\n\nAnd who will be there to hear you when you call\n\nWho will see the madness in your life.\n\nAnd who will be there to catch you if you fall.\n\n\n\nDreams run wild, as lovers find their way through the night,\n\nNot a care in the world\n\nAnd over there, from the twinkling of the lights, harbour lights\n\nSay goodnight one more time\n\n\n\n[Repeat Chorus]"
