  "lyrics": "Do I know better than this?\r\nYou're a word that I can't forget\r\nThough the thought rattles my brain\r\nWill you fold, or will you remain?\r\nIf I don't get better than this man in my skin\n\nIf I don't get better than this man in my skin\n\n\n\nIf I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?\n\nIs it safer if we just say that we tried?\n\nAre we laughing at the danger?\n\nAre we dancing after death, you and I?\n\n\n\nAs the sun waits to eclipse\n\nAnd the taste teases my lips\n\nI'm too tired to wrestle with it\n\nWill we burn, or will we repent?\n\n\n\nIf I don't get better than this man in my skin\n\nIf I don't get better than this man in my skin\n\n\n\nIf I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?\n\nIs it safer if we just say that we tried?\n\nAre we laughing at the danger?\n\nAre we dancing after death, you and I?\n\n\n\nIf I let go, would you hold on? Would we fly?\n\nIs it safer if we just say that we tried?\n\nAre we laughing at the danger?\n\nAre we dancing after death?\n\n\n\nAre we laughing at the danger?\n\nAre we dancing after death, you and I?"
