  "lyrics": "What's not to like 'bout this new love thing?\r\nMidnight kisses, slow dances in the rain\r\nBut you got my heart beating fast\r\nWhere this is going, baby, I can't say\r\nEvery time you leave me, I just want you to stay\r\nBut I gotta know where you stand\n\n\n\nLike the dry ground\n\nWaiting for the rain to fall down\n\nI'm a July sky, you're a bottle rocket\n\nI'm waiting on you\n\nLike a sailboat wishing for the wind to blow\n\nLike a fast car looking for the green to go\n\nI'm right here, baby\n\nDon't keep me waiting on you\n\n\n\nI'm not talkin' 'bout no diamond rings\n\nWhite picket fences, those forever things\n\nBut you gotta make your move\n\n\n\nLike the dry ground\n\nWaiting for the rain to fall down\n\nI'm a July sky, you're a bottle rocket\n\nI'm waiting on you\n\nLike a sailboat wishing for the wind to blow\n\nLike a fast car looking for the green to go\n\nI'm right here, baby\n\nDon't keep me waiting on you\n\nLike the dry ground\n\nWaiting for the rain to fall down\n\nI'm a July sky, you're a bottle rocket\n\nI'm waiting on you\n\nLike a sailboat wishing for the wind to blow\n\nLike a fast car looking for the green to go\n\nI'm right here, baby\n\nDon't keep me waiting on you\n\n\n\nI'm right here, baby\n\nDon't keep me waiting on you"
