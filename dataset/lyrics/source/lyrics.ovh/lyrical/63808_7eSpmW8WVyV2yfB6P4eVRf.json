  "lyrics": "Think I?ll stay home and chill out here tonight\nI?m turning off my cell phone\nI will shine in the sky as the sun with sunglasses \nAnd I need to take a break\n\nI watched my mind glow down in the smoke in a cannon\n\nLook away, look away, look away, look away, look away\n\nI watched your tides go through my window that kisses\n\nLook away, look away, look away, look away, look away\n\n\n\nMeaning of gold skull\n\n\n\nFind myself alone and on your couch last night\n\nIn a black hole of misery\n\nI will shine in the sky as the sun with sunglasses \n\nAnd I need to take a break\n\n\n\nI watched my mind glow down in the smoke in a cannon\n\nLook away, look away, look away, look away, look away\n\nI watched your tides go through my window that kisses\n\nLook away, look away, look away, look away, look away\n\n\n\nMeaning of gold skull\n\n\n\nI watched my mind glow down in the smoke in a cannon\n\nLook away, look away, look away, look away, look away\n\nI watched your tides go through my window that kisses\n\nLook away, look away, look away, look away, look away\n\n\n\nMeaning of gold skull"
