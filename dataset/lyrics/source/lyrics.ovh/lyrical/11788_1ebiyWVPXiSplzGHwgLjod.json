  "lyrics": "If you're tired of running in circles\r\nFeeling like all your plans\r\nAre slipping right through your hands\r\nIf you got troubles deep as an ocean\r\nTrying to breathe again\r\nBut worries keep sinking in\n\nJust lift up your eyes to the sky\n\nYou will find there's freedom on the other side\n\nFor you and I\n\n\n\nI'm telling you there's no such thing as hopeless for a believer there's no such thing as broken for a Redeemer\n\nThere's no war He can't win\n\nNo fear he can't face\n\nNo hurt that He can't heal\n\nNo soul He can't save\n\nThere's no such thing as hopeless for a believer\n\nNo such thing\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like you've heard it before\n\nBut you haven't seen it yet\n\nYou're still in the thick of it\n\nThere is a invitation to be a new creation\n\nSo let your soul awaken\n\nLet your soul awaken\n\n\n\nI'm telling you there's no such thing as hopeless for a believer\n\nThere's no such thing as broken for a Redeemer\n\nDon't you know there's no such thing\n\nThere's no war He can't win\n\nNo fear He can't face\n\nNo hurt He can't heal\n\nNo soul He can't save\n\nThere's no such thing as hopeless for a believer\n\nNo such thing\n\n\n\n[Bridge]"
