  "lyrics": "Some people say there’s a song you can sing\r\nThat goes on and on forever\r\nAnd when you hear that sound voices ringing all around\r\nWe sing all as one together\r\nI ain’t got no soul to sell\n\nAnd I was born in the middle of the heart of the city\n\nDoing fine far as I can tell\n\nI got a beast that calls my name\n\nYeah it comes in the night and it ain’t satisfied\n\nTill we’re both going up in flames\n\n\n\nSome people say there’s a song you can sing\n\nThat goes on and on forever\n\nAnd when you hear that sound voices ringing all around\n\nWe sing all as one together\n\n\n\nOh it’s only rock and roll\n\nIt’s the blood that I bleed it’s the love that I need\n\nAnd it’s all out of my control\n\nAnd I ain’t something you can save\n\n‘Cause the rush of the high keeps me up in the sky\n\nGonna fly till I hit my grave\n\n\n\nSome people say there’s a song you can sing\n\nThat goes on and on forever\n\nAnd when you hear that sound voices ringing all around\n\nWe sing all as one together\n\n\n\nNa na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na\n\nNa na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na\n\n\n\nI pull the shade the morning sun reveals no rain\n\nI wouldn’t trade the world we made for gold or fame\n\nWe’re only six feet from forever\n\nI’ll always be around\n\n\n\nSome people say there’s a song you can sing\n\nThat goes on and on forever\n\n\n\nSome people say\n\nThere’s a song you can sing (You can sing)\n\nThat goes on and on forever (Forever, forever)\n\nAnd when you hear that sound (When you hear that sound)\n\nVoices ringing all around (Ringing all around)\n\nWe sing all as one together (Together, together, together now)\n\nTogether\n\nTogether now\n\n\n\nNa na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na\n\nNa na na na, na na na na na na, na na na na na na, na na na"
