  "lyrics": "I fell into your forbidden arms\r\nBeautiful flower child\r\nI am nothing but an echo through your halls\r\nWon't you just stay here for longer?\r\nI've given all to what is left of you\r\nI don't know where I went wrong, I went wrong\n\n\n\nLately do you feel better when I'm gone?\n\nI made a mess of myself again\n\nI know it's all my fault\n\nI've been, I've been whatever you wanted\n\nIt's such a shame that still no one likes looking up when they are lost, they are lost\n\n\n\nThreading the skin\n\nI am at fault for you\n\nKeeping me in\n\nFaith in an empty room\n\nSomething I've missed in everyone but you\n\nKeeping me in\n\nFaith in an empty room\n\n\n\nInnocent pawn, goddess of my thoughts\n\nAs the world turned, we stood far apart\n\nFar apart\n\nFlower child is stuck in her condition\n\nAs the world turned, we had fallen apart\n\nFallen apart\n\n\n\nI am wrapped up in momentary touch\n\nI'm feeling so worn down\n\nI have tried but I know that's not enough\n\n\n\nThreading the skin\n\nI am at fault for you\n\nKeeping me in\n\nFaith in an empty room\n\nThousands of bricks, I carried them all for you\n\nKeeping me in\n\nFaith in an empty room"
