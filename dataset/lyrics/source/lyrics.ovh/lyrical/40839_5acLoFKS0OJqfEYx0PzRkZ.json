  "lyrics": "I think I talk too much\r\nClose my eyes when I drive\r\nRunning lights in the daylight\r\nMaybe I’m out of luck?\r\nMaybe I should give a fuck?\n\nBut oh I just want to be sure\n\nThat I’m alive\n\nI need to feel something inside\n\n\n\nUsed to keep me up when I fell down\n\nBut my heart is heavy now\n\nMy heart is too heavy now\n\nSo I know another thing that we could do to feel alive\n\n\n\nI think we talk too much about what we hide from one another\n\nDoes that sound like fun to you?\n\nI know another thing you’d rather do\n\nDon’t you want to be sure that you’re alive?\n\nTo feel something inside\n\n\n\nUsed to keep me up when I fell down\n\nBut my heart is heavy now\n\nMy heart is too heavy now\n\nSo I know another thing that we could do to feel alive\n\n\n\nMy heart is heavy now\n\n\n\nUsed to keep me up when I fell down\n\nBut my heart is heavy now\n\nMy heart is too heavy now\n\nSo I know another thing that we could do to feel alive"
