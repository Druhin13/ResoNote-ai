  "lyrics": "We use to pull off highway 249\r\nHad a cool little place where we'd go hide on a Friday night\r\nAnd get away from the city lights\r\nWe'd find a little wood and build a fire\r\nSonebody'd always bring a couple guitars\r\nAnd we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn\n\nWe'd do \"Ramblin' Man\", \"Proud Mary\". and \"American Band\"\n\nWe'd be singin' at the top of our lungs\n\n\n\nChours:\n\nIt was always the love songs every time\n\nMade everybody feel something inside\n\nWith the fire down low held your girl real close\n\nMade you wanna love the one you wre with\n\nGave you the courage of that first kiss\n\nIt was the love songs always the love songs\n\n\n\nThere was always a line stuck in your head\n\nThat was said in a way you wished you could've said\n\nBut you both knew they were singin' it right to you\n\nIt felt so good those times you had\n\nThat feelin' of wanting sombody so bad\n\nMade you weak in the heart you couldn't take being apart\n\nHonky tonk drinkin' songs we could do 'em all night long\n\nBut the ones i remember the most\n\n\n\nRepeat Chours\n\n\n\nWe'd be singin' at the top of our lungs\n\n\n\nRepear Chours\n\n\n\nAlways the love songs\n\nAlways the love songs"
