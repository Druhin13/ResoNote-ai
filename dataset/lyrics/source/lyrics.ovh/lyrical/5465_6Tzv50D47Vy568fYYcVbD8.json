  "lyrics": "Someday I'll be a star\r\nThat's shining bright in the sky\r\nI'm giving up on you bastards\r\nGive me lovers\r\nSo I may have my pleasures\r\nAnd not lose my heart\n\n\n\nSometimes when I feel remorseful and I wish I could've lived a life more less normal\n\nSo typical\n\nOver critical\n\nEmpty my body just to feel the love\n\nWhat's the price of the light when you're stuck in the shadows\n\nDon't let me know\n\nSee how it goes"
