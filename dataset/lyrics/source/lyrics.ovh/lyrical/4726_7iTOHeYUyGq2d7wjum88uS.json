  "lyrics": "Please tell me somebody's up there\r\nAnd why I'm even singing at all\r\nA crowded room that no one's in\r\nStealing all my oxygen\r\nHolding on just to let it go\n\nEverything is a memory that\n\nYour silence can be deafening\n\nWith every bond you break\n\nYou break me down\n\n\n\nSo carve my name out\n\nLook what it's like to fall apart\n\nSo far away now\n\nAlready ruined from the start\n\nAnd you're not forgiven\n\nAnd I'm not giving up\n\n\n\nPlease tell me somebody's out there\n\nYeah, I already know what you'll say\n\nThat you're overrated, burned out and faded\n\nNo one can save me now\n\n\n\nYou hold me up just to bring me down\n\nWhere no one can hear me screaming\n\nYou hold me up just to bring me down\n\nSo why can't you hear me\n\nI'm right where you left me\n\n\n\nSo carve my name out\n\nLook what it's like to fall apart\n\n(Look what it's like)\n\nSo far away now\n\nAlready ruined from the start\n\nAnd you're not forgiven\n\nAnd I'm not giving up\n\n\n\nAre we ashes in the fire\n\nOr will we rise above the flames?\n\n\n\nSo carve my name out\n\nLook what it's like to fall apart\n\nSo far away now\n\nAlready ruined from the start\n\n\n\nSo carve my name out\n\nLook what it's like to fall apart\n\nSo far away now\n\nAlready ruined from the start\n\nAnd you're not forgiven\n\nAnd I'm not forgetting\n\nThat you're not the reason\n\nThat I'm not giving up"
