You funny, boy\n\nYou were birthed by a woman, show some fucking respect\n\nI like you much better when you shut up\n\nAnd get down, down on your knees, babe\n\n‘Cause I’m a 10 out of 10, got you saying amen\n\nCatch me dodging that dick again and again and again\n\n\n\nWe don’t need no one (We don’t need ‘em, baby)\n\nTryna take our freedom (freedom)\n\nTime won't let you stay young\n\nSo, we don't care what they say\n\nWe gon' love who we wanna love\n\n\n\nOh whoa, yeah, oh, oh whoa\n\nWe gon' love who we wanna love\n\nOh whoa, yeah, oh\n\nWe don't care what they say\n\nWe gon' love who we wanna love\n\n\n\nDon’t you make me count 'em on my fingers\n\nGon’ be hot when I say I ran out of hands\n\nI’m sure if tables turned and it was dollar signs per body\n\nYou would be one very rich and wealthy man\n\nI dodge dick for some pussy, something that we can agree on\n\nDon’t tell me it’s a turn on for you, or maybe it bothers you\n\nThat you’re the only one out the equation\n\n\n\nWe don’t need no one (no one)\n\nTryna take our freedom (no no, no no, no no)\n\nTime won't let you stay young\n\nSo, we don't care what they say\n\nWe gon' love who we wanna love\n\n\n\nOh whoa, yeah, oh, oh whoa\n\nWe gon' love who we wanna love\n\nOh whoa, yeah, oh\n\nWe don't care what they say\n\nWe gon' love who we wanna love\n\n\n\nI saw my ex and then I swerved, sue me\n\nMiss me with that bullshit for the birds, sue me\n\nI know they did me dirty while I still had the title\n\nBut I don't hold any anger, I just swerve\n\nHallelujah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nHallelujah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nThat's what I said to them, yeah"
