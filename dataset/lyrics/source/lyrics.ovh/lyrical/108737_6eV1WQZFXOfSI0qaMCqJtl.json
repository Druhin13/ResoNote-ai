  "lyrics": "There ain't nothing like waking up too early at my mom's house\r\n'Cause every wall's paper thin and my family talks too loud\r\nBut I do the same, it's just how we're raised\r\nBut I feel just as right across state lines in my downtown apartment\r\nI can barely afford the concrete floors and the limited parking\r\nBut I can't see myself anywhere else\n\n\n\n'Cause I got highway and I got a back road\n\nI got a fast paced life and place I go to move slow\n\nOne I wanna make it, one I wanna make proud\n\nNo matter which one I'm leaving still wanna turn around\n\n'Cause I got a home and I got a hometown\n\n\n\nThere ain't nothing like 4th of July, parade full of tractors\n\nThe candy thrown, faces I know, head to the lake after\n\nSame firework show that I've always known\n\nHead back to Monday night, half price wine at Barcelona\n\nAlways meeting him and our best friends don't order 'cause they know us\n\n200 miles apart don't feel that far\n\n\n\n'Cause I got highway and I got a back road\n\nI got a fast paced life and place I go to move slow\n\nOne I wanna make it, one I wanna make proud\n\nNo matter which one I'm leaving still wanna turn around\n\n'Cause I got a home and I got a hometown\n\n\n\n200 miles apart don't feel that far\n\n\n\n'Cause I got highway and I got a back road\n\nI got a fast paced life and place I go to move slow\n\nOne I wanna make it, one I wanna make proud\n\nNo matter which one I'm leaving still wanna turn around\n\n'Cause I got a home and I got a hometown\n\nOh yeah, I got a home and I got a hometown"
