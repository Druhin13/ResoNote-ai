  "lyrics": "Your head fits right into my shoulder\r\nMy hands feel cold but yours feel colder\r\nAnd you're burning up inside\r\nI see the pain behind your eyes\r\nI know my hands can't help from shaking\r\nI can't stand thinking of him taking\n\nThe safety in your head\n\nThe comfort of your bed\n\n\n\nWe were too young to drink, too drunk to drive\n\nToo young to feel these things inside\n\nThe westside's always pulling your burden straight into my current\n\nShe said it's too hard to comprehend\n\nI just wanna feel safe again\n\nThe westside's always pulling, but you could never be a burden\n\nIt's alright, it's alright\n\n\n\nYeah we've gotten a bit older\n\nWe've learned to keep our composure\n\nBut we can't forget the nights\n\nThe blue skies or flashing lights\n\nYour voice keeps ringing like a siren\n\nI hear it louder still in silence\n\nYeah you're tough just like your love\n\nAnd you've never given up\n\n\n\nWe were too young to drink, too drunk to drive\n\nToo young to feel these things inside\n\nThe westside's always pulling your burden straight into my current\n\nShe said it's too hard to comprehend\n\nI just wanna feel safe again\n\nThe westside's always pulling, but you could never be a burden\n\nIt's alright, it's alright\n\n\n\nYou hit me like a headrush, and hurt like a paper cut\n\nAnd you're still in my head but just not in my heart\n\nI mean it when I hope that you're ok\n\nI hope you've made peace in your own way\n\nAnd you're still in my head even though we've grown apart\n\n\n\nWe met way too young, grew up too fast\n\nThe love that we had could never last\n\nBut the westside's always pulling\n\nReturning you into my current\n\n\n\nShe said it's too hard to comprehend\n\nI just wanna feel safe again\n\nThe westside's always pulling, but you could never be a burden\n\nIt's alright, it's alright\n\nYeah the westside's always pulling, but you could never be a burden\n\nIt's alright, it's alright"
