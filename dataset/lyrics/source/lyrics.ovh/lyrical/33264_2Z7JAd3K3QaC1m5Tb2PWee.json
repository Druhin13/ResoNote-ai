  "lyrics": "I'm a wreck from a world that had failed me now\r\nDisconnected from all that had held me down\r\nCan you help me?\r\nCan you help me?\r\nCause the world left a bad taste in my mouth\r\nAnd I don't know if I can trust myself\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you help me?\n\n\n\nYou want the truth?\n\nWell this is all that I've had\n\nI gave you the pieces\n\nThat I held in my hands\n\nAnd we built up walls we thought that nothing could break\n\nBelieving that became my biggest mistake\n\n\n\nHold on\n\n\n\nThis never went as we planned\n\nBut you folded the game before I showed you my hand\n\nI believed in this when there was nothing to show\n\nAnd cut my own damn beliefs\n\nJust to give you a piece of myself\n\n\n\nI'm a wreck from a world that had failed me now\n\nDisconnected from all that had held me down\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCause the world left a bad taste in my mouth\n\nAnd I don't know if I can trust myself\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you help me?\n\n\n\nThree years on and there is nothing I'd change\n\nSure we had some regrets but they were only mistakes\n\nAnd I'd rather fall from something I can control\n\nThan make a fool of myself playing god at the helm\n\n\n\nSo sick and tired of this shit\n\nI put my heart on the line\n\nJust to sit back and watch\n\nYou were wasting my time\n\nIs this what I get for dedicating my life\n\nTo a noose around my neck\n\nAnd a dream in my mind\n\n\n\nI'm a wreck from a world that had failed me now\n\nDisconnected from all that had held me down\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCause the world left a bad taste in my mouth\n\nAnd I don't know if I can trust myself\n\nCan you help me?\n\nCan you help me?\n\n\n\nThe words fire from my enemies\n\nThey wear me down as they cut up across me\n\nBut I'm still here and gaining ground"
