  "lyrics": "I left home\r\nTears in my eye\r\nWhere I was going\r\nI had no idea\r\nThat must have been\n\nThe last time I cried\n\nFrom that moment forward\n\nAll my teardrops disappeared\n\n\n\nYeah I'm going down\n\nWhere there ain't no one around\n\nNobody knows who I am\n\n\n\nThere's no way out\n\nNo north, no south\n\nHere in no man's land\n\n\n\nDigging for days\n\nBut no sign of diamonds\n\nAll that I saw\n\nWas garbage and worms\n\n\n\nAnd a glimpse of the future\n\nThe maniac horizon \n\nA silhouette I will dance\n\nIn the lightning storm\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm going down\n\nTo the forgotten part of town\n\nWith roses and rubies in my hands\n\n\n\nThe fog rolls in\n\nAnd waltzes with the wind\n\nHere in no man's land\n\n\n\nThe time finally came\n\nTo abandon my name\n\nTake a blind-eyed leap\n\nInto the big old unknown\n\n\n\nSomeday maybe you'll find me\n\nLike a wild Santa Claus\n\nIn a tinfoil hat\n\nTalking on a disconnected telephone\n\n\n\nBut I got my crown\n\nAnd I got my sacred cow\n\nI'm a Buddha in a blazing sinking sand \n\n\n\nThe purple skies\n\nElectrify my eyes\n\nHere in no man's land\n\n\n\nTell my neighbor to water my plants\n\nTell the devil that I learned how to dance\n\nTell the angels to wait up for me\n\nTell the world I'm free and I'm\n\n\n\nDeep in a dream\n\nLandscape is empty\n\nExcept for one soul\n\nShe's waiting there for me\n\n\n\nI fell into her arms\n\nI faintly remember\n\nThe sweet song of salvation\n\nThe hummingbirds in the trees\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm checking out\n\nAnd I'm riding on a cloud\n\nBack to where my whole being began\n\n\n\nWell, I started to speak in tongues\n\nAnd swing around the sun\n\nHere in no man's land\n\n\n\nOh, here in no man's land\n\n\n\nOh, here in no man's land"
