Okay\r\nWell hold these sunflower seeds, I'm going in\n\nGuess who's bizack, the best 2 that's gon' ever do it\n\nDon't need no metro or Neptune's trizack\n\nThis is what you call alcoholic recordin', flawless guitar rifts\n\nNow they ridin' with us for sure in the Audi or this\n\nFerrari, this is for Joe Montgomery and Johnny Morris\n\nNow we 'bout to Power up the Ghost like Omari Hardwick\n\nTime flies when you havin' a nice time\n\nSo when I drive I try to ride slower than Heinz pourin'\n\nMy mama told me to try to enjoy it\n\nTake you a vitamin boy and stick to your diet and tore it\n\nKeep risin' and soarin', don't put your mind on the evil\n\nKeep your eye on the people who would kill just to be by you\n\nAnd beware of those who appear to be dyin' to meet you\n\nLet your therapy be The Bible and let yourself just be legendary\n\nAnd just continue to keep on helpin' the less fortunate\n\nNot for no fuckin' credit in public but for the blessings above\n\nMost important lesson I learned was just to love (true)\n\nMost of my aggression was extra liquor and just the drugs (true)\n\nWherever I go, whoever I'm with, I'm met with hugs (true)\n\nWhile all you rappers gettin' extorted, in debt with thugs\n\n\n\nI'm ridin' around in a Maserati 'bout to go to McDonald's eatin' sunflower seeds (laid back)\n\nBut still I spit the shell out the window\n\nStill I spit the shell out the window\n\nNow that I'm livin' well all I remember is all I could afford was sunflower seeds (laid back)\n\nBut still I spit the shell out the window\n\nStill I spit the shell out the window\n\n\n\nI will spit these out a Gallardo\n\nThen peel off laughin' like Ricky Ricardo\n\nGo to your lady home and spit a whole bag of sunflower seeds out on her marble\n\nFloor, oh no I didn't\n\nI kill the fish and put wings on the dog for you treatin' me like I don't, don't know fly bitches\n\nNickel, I'm back in the prime of things\n\n2 jackas this one is tabular, that one is Steve McQueen\n\nI flip on a rapper quick as Christopher could finish up a trap on a beat machine\n\nI pull out a full metal jacket\n\nShow you exactly what goin' platinum with features mean\n\nI am the absolute shit I actually speak latrine, PRhyme 2\n\nAll day you hear UZI, choppers and nines too\n\nAll day you niggas eat sushi, sausage and fondue\n\nThe drum dilla like Ma Duke\n\nThe Hummer red and it come atop\n\nGiant sized shoes like clown suits\n\nThe rifle rightfully mine too, it might just heat up from the field in the clutch like when Mike and LeBron shoot\n\n\n\nRidin' around in a Maserati 'bout to go to McDonald's eatin' sunflower seeds (laidback)\n\nBut still I spit the shell out the window\n\nBut still I spit the shell out the window\n\nNow that I'm livin' well all I remember is all I could afford was sunflower seeds (laidback)\n\nBut still I spit the shell out the window\n\nStill I spit the shell out the window\n\n\n\nAnd I, I grew up in the streets\n\nOne man (one man), one heart (one heart), one love (one love)\n\nLivin' in the ghetto you get one chance (you get one chance)\n\nYou know I keep a piece and my sunflower seeds in the other hand\n\nAnd Po-Po out here shootin' niggas, yeah they tryna kill the brother man\n\nAnd I, I grew up in the streets\n\nOne man (one man), one heart (one heart), one love (one love)\n\nLivin' in the ghetto you get one chance (you get one chance)\n\nYou know I keep a piece and my sunflower seeds in the other hand"
