  "lyrics": "Hey boys, Miss Magic is back \nNo Hollywood waste, or tinsel trash \nA street kid, she's no stray cat, \nHeaven on legs, she's a feline flash. \nTakes a good woman to play a good man \nAnd no one plays like heaven can \n\n\n\nShe said \n\nLeave your name at the the sound of the tone, \n\nCall you right back when I get home \n\nBetter watch out when we're all alone \n\n\n\nHeaven is a girl I know so well \n\nShe makes me feel good when I feel like hell \n\nHeaven is a girl that I've got to have \n\nAnd she makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad \n\n\n\nHey boys, Miss Magic is mine \n\nNo silicone smile, she's vintage wine \n\nBombshell blonde, red lipstick on \n\nAqualine fine she's a real wild one \n\n\n\n[Repeat Bridge]\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\nOh, no one does it good like heaven do, no \n\nShe's got the rhythm to drive me crazy, \n\nShe's got the rhythm of love. \n\n\n\nShe said leave your name at the sound of the tone, \n\nThe lights are off, but there's somebody home \n\nBetter watch out when we're all alone. \n\nHeaven is a girl I know so well \n\nShe makes me feel good when I feel like hell \n\nHeaven is a girl that I've got to have, \n\nAnd she makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad \n\nHeaven is a girl that makes dreams come true \n\nAnd no one does it good like Heaven do \n\nHeaven is a girl that I've got to have, \n\nShe makes me feel good when I feel like hell \n\nHeaven is a girl, she makes dreams come true \n\nAnd no one does it good like Heaven do \n\nThat voodoo that you do"
