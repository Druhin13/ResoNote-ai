And cheepnis in the case of a monster movie has nothing to do with the budget of the film, although it helps. But true cheepnis is exemplified by visible nylon strings attached to the jaw of a giant spider. I'll tell you, a good one that I saw one time, I think the name of the film was \"It conquered the world\" (YEAH!) And the... Did you ever see that one? The monster looks sort of like an inverted ice-cream corn with teeth around the bottom. It looks like a, like a teepee or a sort of a rounded off pup-tent affair. And ah, it's got fangs on the base of it, I don't know why but it's a very threatening sight. And then he's got a frown and, you know, ugly mouth and everything, And there's this one scene where the ah monster is coming out of a cave. See? There's always a scene where they come out of a cave, at least once. And the rest of the cast...it musta been made around the 1950's. The lapels are about like th\n\nat wide, The ties are about that wide and about this short, And they always have a little revolver that they're gonna shoot the monster with. And there is always a girl who falls down and twists her ankle. Hey hey! Of course there is! You know how they are, the weaker sex and everything, Twisting their ankle on behalf of a little ice-cream corn. Well in this particular scene, In this scene folks, they ah, they didn't wanna re-take it 'cause it musta been so good they wanted to keep it, but they... When the monster came out of the cave, just over on the left hand side of the screen you can see about this much two-by-four attached to the bottom of the Thing as the guy is pushing it out, And then obviously off-camera somebody's goin': \"No! Get it back!\" ...and they drag it back just a little bit as the guy is goin': \"KCH! KCH!\" Now that's cheepnis. \n\n\nRight. And this is cheepnis here: One two three four... \n\nI ate a hot dog \nIt tasted real good \nThen I watched a movie \nFrom Hollywood \n\n(repeat) \n\nLittle Miss Muffett on a squat by me \nTook a turn around, I said: Can y'all see? \nThe little strings on the Giant Spider?\" \nThe Zipper From The Black Lagoon? \nThe vents by the tanks where the bubbles go up? \n(And the flaps on the side of the moon) \n\n\nThe jelly & paint on the 40 watt bulb \nThey use when the slime droozle off \nThe rumples & the wrinkles in the cardboard rock \nAnd the canvas of the cave is too soft \n\nThe suits & the hats & the tie's too wide \nAnd too short for the scientist man \nThe chemistry lady with the roll-away mind \nAnd the monster just ate Japan \n\nLadies and gentlemen, \nThe monster, \nWhich the peasants in this area call FRUNOBULAX \n(Apparently a very large poodle dog) \nHas just been seen approaching The Power Plant \nBullets can't stop it \nRockets can't stop it \nWe may have to use NUCLEAR FORCE! \n\n\nHERE COMES THAT POODLE DOG! \nBIG AS A BLIMP WITH A RHINESTONE COLLAR \nSNAPPIN' OFF THE TREES \nLIKE THEY WAS BONSAI'D ORNAMENTS ON A \nDRY-WOBBLE LANDSCAPE \nKEEP IT AWAY! DON'T LET THE POODLE BITE ME! \nWE CAN'T LET IT REPRODUCE! OH! \nSOMEBODY GET OUT THE PANTS! \n\nThe National Guard has formed up at the base \nof the mountain \nAnd is attempting to lure the enormous poodle \ntowards the cave \nWhere they hope to destroy it with napalm \nA thousand of the troopers are now lined up \nand are calling to the monster... \nHere Fido \n\nHere Fido \nHere Fido \n\nGOT A GREAT BIG SLIMEY THING \nGOT A GREAT BIG HEAVY THING \nGOT A GREAT BIG POODLE THING \nGOT A GREAT BIG HAIRY THING \n\n(repeat) \n\nC'mon! Everybody! Let's go! \nGet the distilled water! Get the canned goods! \nGet the toilet paper! You know we need it! \n\nGO TO DA SHELTER \nMY BABY, MY BABY, \nGO TO DA SHELTER \nGO TO DA SHELTER \n\n\n(repeat) \n\nLittle Miss Muffett on a squat by me, \nCan ya see the little string danglin' down \nMakes the legs go wabble an' the mouth flop shut \nAn' the HORRIBLE EYE, HORRIBLE EYE, HORRIBLE EYE \nGo rollin' around \nCan y'see it all \nCan y'see it from here \nCan y'laugh till yer weak on yer knees \nIf you can't, I'm sorry `cause that's \nall I wanna know \nI need a little more cheepnis please \nBaby, I'm sorry `cause it's all I wanna know \nI need a little more cheepnis please \nBaby, I'm sorry `cause it's all I wanna know \nI need a little more cheepnis please \n\n\n(etc. repeats)"
