  "lyrics": "You push the bottom and we'll do the rest\r\nThe exotic sound of data storage\r\nNothing like it first thing in the morning\r\nYou push the button and we’ll do the rest\r\nBastard latin\r\nThat’s the best thing for it\n\n\n\nYou and Lizzy in the summertime\n\nWrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby\n\n\n\nThere are things that I just cannot explain to you\n\nAnd those that I hope I don’t ever have to pattern language\n\n\n\nIn the mood for love\n\nYou push the button and we’ll do the rest\n\nYou and genie wearing stetson hats\n\nTrying to gain access to my lily pad\n\n\n\nThere are things that I just cannot explain to you\n\nAnd those that I hope I don’t ever have to\n\n\n\nThe world’s first ever monster truck front flip\n\nI’m just a bad girl trying to be good\n\nI’ve got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust\n\nForward thinking model villages\n\nMore brain shrinking moving images\n\nYou push the button and we’ll do the rest"
