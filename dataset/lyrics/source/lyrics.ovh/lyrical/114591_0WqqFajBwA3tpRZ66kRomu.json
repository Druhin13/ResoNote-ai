No\n\n\n\nBut at least I got you in my head, oh yeah\n\nAt least I got you in my head, in my head\n\nSleepovers in my bed, oh yeah\n\nAt least I got you in my head, in my head\n\nIn my head\n\nIn my head\n\n\n\nAlways there to brush your hair\n\nHelp you pick out what to wear\n\nI just feel alone, feel alone\n\nYou will never understand\n\nEven when you hold my hand\n\nI just feel alone, feel alone\n\nI don't wanna talk about it\n\nI don't wanna think about it\n\nI just feel alone, feel alone\n\nEven when you're next to me\n\nIt's not the way I'm picturing, no\n\n\n\nBut at least I got you in my head, oh yeah\n\nAt least I got you in my head, in my head\n\nSleepovers in my bed, oh yeah\n\nAt least I got you in my head, in my head\n\nIn my head\n\nIn my head\n\n\n\nCome on, let's sleep in my bed\n\nCan I just be in my head with you?\n\nCome on, let's sleep in my bed\n\nCan I just be in my head with you?\n\nAnd it breaks my heart, yeah it breaks my heart\n\nI do this every single time, every time\n\n\n\nBut at least I got you in my head, oh yeah\n\nAt least I got you in my head, in my head\n\nSleepovers in my bed, oh yeah\n\nAt least I got you in my head, in my head"
