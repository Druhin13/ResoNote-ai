You gotta sit in it. You gotta sit in it, for yourself and for other people. I'm talking to myself right now\r\nWe took a paper shredder to the library\r\nWe guillotined our memory, anxiety\r\nWe're pulling down the blinds\n\nAnd I might be lying, but I want to simplify\n\nI read a story about a boy\n\nArms stretched out to the sky\n\nThere were pictures\n\nAnd they were black, and they were white\n\n\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\n\n\nWe took a paper shredder to the library\n\nSlow down, you're missing all the scenery\n\nOh, what's the use? Oh, what's the use\n\nOf always thinking where you're not\n\n'Cause where you need to be\n\n\n\nI'm so naive, but I want to simplify\n\nAnd I remember you and I\n\nArms stretched out to the sky\n\nAnd there is proof\n\nAnd it's in black, and it's in white\n\n\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\n\n\nLet's call it love\n\nLet's call it love\n\nLet's call it love\n\nAnd it's in black, and it's in white\n\n\n\n(black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nLet's dance, black and white (black and white)\n\nLet's call it love\n\nLet's dance, black and white (black and white)\n\nLet's call it love\n\nLet's dance, black and white (black and white)\n\nLet's call it love\n\nLet's dance (black and white)\n\nIt's in black, and it's in white\n\n\n\nThe options to acquit[?] feelings in the culture we live in now is very profound. That's what it's demanding of you. Get lost. Get a hint"
