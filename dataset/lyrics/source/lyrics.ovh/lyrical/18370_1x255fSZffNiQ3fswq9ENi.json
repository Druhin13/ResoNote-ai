  "lyrics": "\"He's so inspiring to me\"\r\n\"He ain't shit from what I see\"\r\n\"Oh, he's voice is so heavenly\"\r\n\"That nigga sound like a crying lamb\"\r\n\"Will his blackness scare white folks away?\"\r\n\"Will they all turn when they hear he's gay?\"\n\n\"Is my success just one big mistake?\"\n\n\"Yo, don't be a bitch listening to what they say\"\n\n\n\nThat's my insecurities\n\nI'm just being honest\n\nThat's my insecurities\n\nI'm just being honest\n\nBut you see they want me to accept and follow that\n\nSo that slows me down and throw me right off track\n\nThat's my insecurities\n\nI'm just being honest\n\n\n\nThis goes out to the little boy who's got it rough\n\nFears of being unfit, feeling like you ain't good enough\n\nAnd for the little girl who's told that she's \"too fit\" or \"you're too fat\"\n\nThat she's \"too brown\", \"too strong\", \"too smart\" to unapologetically laugh\n\n\n\nFuck those insecurities\n\nLet's keep it honest\n\nFuck all your insecurities\n\nLet's keep it honest\n\nDon't you see they want you to accept they lies as facts\n\nSo it can slow you down and throw you right off track\n\nFuck your insecurities\n\nMan made insecurities\n\nNo need insecurities (No)\n\n\n\n(Now we got that out the way)"
