  "lyrics": "Last night I laid awake in bed\r\nCan't shake the lies up in my head\r\nI was scrolling instead of sleepin'\r\nA thousand faces in my hand\r\nHow could I measure up to them\r\nAnd in that moment I was weepin'\n\n\n\nI don't know if I've ever felt more alone\n\n(If we had the chance to be real would we take it, take it?)\n\nI don't know if I've ever felt really known\n\n('Cause if we all keep faking we're not gonna make it, make it)\n\n\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nWe've all got some broken we're hiding\n\nNone of us are ok\n\nWe all fall, we all break\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nTo let the light in (Light in, light in; light in, light in)\n\nTo let the light in (Light in, light in; light in, light in)\n\n\n\nI need you to look me in the eye\n\nTell me that you're not always fine\n\n'Cause on the surface it's picture perfect\n\nI know it's just a highlight reel\n\nBut I can't help the way I feel\n\nThat I'm too much and I'm not enough\n\n\n\nHeaven knows we were never meant to be alone\n\n(If we had the chance to be real would we take it, take it?)\n\nBroken hearts are a beautiful kaleidoscope\n\n('Cause if we all keep faking we're not gonna make it, make it)\n\n\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nWe've all got some broken we're hiding\n\nNone of us are ok\n\nWe all fall, we all break\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nTo let the light in (Light in, light in; light in, light in)\n\nTo let the light in (Light in, light in; light in, light in)\n\n\n\nAll together, all alone\n\nFeeling homesick in our homes\n\nYou take a step, I'll take one too\n\nI'll reach for You\n\n\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nWe've all got some broken we're hiding\n\nNone of us are ok\n\nWe all fall, we all break\n\nThis is a song to remind me (To remind me)\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nWe've all got some broken we're hiding\n\nNone of us are ok (Ok)\n\nWe all fall (Fall), we all break (Break)\n\nThis is a song to remind me\n\nTo let the light in (Light in, light in; light in, light in)\n\nTo let the light in (Light in, light in; light in, light in)\n\n\n\nTo let the light in"
