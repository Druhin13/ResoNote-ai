  "lyrics": "We slither out on a Tuesday,\r\nfeeling tired and hopeless, and I don't know why\r\nThis life is a wonder\r\nThis life is a wonder\n\nHelp me see through yesterday,\n\nI need a barricade, I need an extra life\n\nMy body's a wonder\n\nMy body's a wonder\n\n\n\nBreak out the health machine\n\nIt makes us live it up\n\nIt keeps us free and clean\n\nIt gives my heart the beat and I don't know why\n\n\n\nI look over to my best friend\n\nThey have weakness\n\nThey are pale and tired\n\nI know how to save them\n\nI know how to save them\n\n\n\nBreak out the health machine\n\nIt makes us live it up\n\nIt keeps us free and clean\n\nIt gives my heart the beat and I don't know why"
