  "lyrics": "You are\r\nA touchdown on a Friday night\r\nA silver crown, homecoming queen\r\nRight underneath those bleacher lights\r\nYou are\r\nA verse right out a Springsteen song\n\nA red Chevelle just giving it hell\n\nOn the main street drag all night long\n\n\n\nYou are\n\nThe last day of a Spring break week\n\nThe best sleep that I never got\n\nA sunrise on Daytona beach\n\nYou are\n\nToo many shots of Maker's Mark\n\nA quick stop in a tattoo shop\n\nYour name forever on my arm\n\n\n\nAnd I don't take for granted\n\nEverything that we've been through\n\nIn my head you're stranded\n\nAnd you ain't even meaning to but you are\n\nYeah, baby, you are\n\n\n\nYou are\n\nA blanket on the Summer ground\n\nStars in the sky the night we'd find\n\nThat feeling that we hadn't found\n\nYou are\n\nOne pink line instead of two\n\nA sigh of relief that [you're?] looking at me\n\n'Cause heaven knows what we would do\n\n\n\nAnd I don't take for granted\n\nEverything that we've been through\n\nIn my head you're stranded\n\nAnd you ain't even meaning to but you are\n\n\n\nYou are\n\nThe reason that I get to say\n\nI've been in love, and I messed it up\n\nI've got a girl that got away\n\n\n\nAnd I don't take for granted\n\nEverything that we've been through\n\nIn my head you're stranded\n\nAnd you ain't even meaning to but you are\n\nYeah, baby, you are\n\n\n\nYou are\n\nYeah, baby, you are"
