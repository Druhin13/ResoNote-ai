  "lyrics": "Caught the bus at 506\r\nThat's in the AM for all you little trust fund kids\r\nAnd it's a 45 minute trip\r\nIf she ain't in by six she'll catch another pink slip\r\nAnd that's three and that means fired\r\nA coffee thurmus in the purse to help her keep wired\n\nThe daycare where she drops the baby off\n\nThank god it's on the same block as the bus stop\n\nAt 530 she's half way there\n\nAnd her back already hurts from the buses plastic chair\n\nLive to work to live to work to live\n\nGotta feed the kid and give it all she's got to give\n\nPlus she's trying to catch a little overtime\n\nIf she stays till four she could be home by five\n\nShuts her eyes for the rest of the route\n\nAnd keeps her headphones loud\n\nTo drown everything out but the same old song\n\n\n\n[Chorus: x2]\n\nRun!\n\nOh not another day!\n\nNot another day of the same old song!\n\n\n\nSeemed like nobody even knew his name huh\n\nIf he dissapeared would they even see the blank spot\n\nThe only that kids that might notice are the ones who\n\nPush him up and down the hallways and in the lunch room\n\nSometimes he looks at his bruises\n\nAnd wants to come to school with a gun like them kids on news did\n\nBut naw man they don't deserve to die\n\nHe's the type that couldn't hurt a fly\n\nI guess you get used to the life\n\nMaybe that's why he refuses to cry\n\nTakes it on the chin takes it in stride\n\nWhat doesn't break you just makes you stronger right?\n\nSo he sits by himself on the school bus\n\nHoping that today he wouldn't have to put his dukes up\n\nBut just like any other here they come to fuck with his comfort\n\nCan't wait for summer it's the same old song\n\n\n\n[Chorus: x2]\n\nRun!\n\nOh not another day!\n\nNot another day of the same old song!\n\n\n\nC'mon\n\nWoke up at the taste of dawn\n\nWhere the cities bloodline starts to push it along\n\nThe generators on those public buses\n\nIs enough to bust you out of any dream that you stuck in\n\nI guess that's the chance you takin\n\nWhen you camp out infront of that transfer station\n\nAnd this town got no answers to chase\n\nThat's why he always sleeps near the transportation\n\nPanhandleling\n\nTransient\n\nFreedom\n\nTransplant\n\nHe ain't from this region\n\nAnd when the win starts to whisper it's lips\n\nHe knows enough to pack it up and dip out before the winter hits\n\nChildhood dreams washed down the gutter\n\nBoth parents gone no sister's no brothers'\n\nWeak memories\n\nStrong paranoia\n\nWhile the same song repeats in his head over and over and over and over it goes\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nRun!\n\nOh not another day!\n\nNot another day of the same old song!\n\n\n\nRun!\n\nOh not another day!\n\nNot another day of the same old song! C'mon\n\n\n\nRun!\n\nOh not another day!\n\nNot another day of the same old song!\n\n\n\nRun!\n\nOh not another day!\n\nNot another day of the same old song! C'mon"
