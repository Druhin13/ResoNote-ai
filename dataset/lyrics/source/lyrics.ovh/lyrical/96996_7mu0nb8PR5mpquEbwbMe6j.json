  "lyrics": "I don't know if you're listening or if you wanted to hear from me\r\nI don't feel like you're supposed to when somebody sets you free\r\nI'm not good at pretending that I'm happy to be alone\r\nPart of me is a question, can't answer it on my own\r\n'Cause I lost part of me when I lost all of you, now I'm lost\n\nI don't wanna come crawling, crawling\n\nBut I catch myself falling, falling\n\nI could try to stop calling, calling just to show myself\n\nDid you keep my sweater, sweater\n\nDid you read my letter, letter?\n\nDo you know me better, better than I know myself?\n\nDo you know me better, better than I know myself?\n\n\n\nI don't feel like we're done here\n\nYou got a lock on the things I want\n\nI'm a lost, lonely one here who's addicted to holding on\n\nI don't have you to kiss now and I'm putting myself to sleep\n\nBut it's me that I miss now, there's a me that I didn't keep\n\n\n\nI don't wanna come crawling, crawling\n\nBut I catch myself falling, falling\n\nI could try to stop calling, calling just to show myself\n\nDid you keep my sweater, sweater\n\nDid you read my letter, letter?\n\nDo you know me better, better than I know myself?\n\nDo you know me better, better than I know myself?\n\nThan I know myself?\n\n\n\n'Cause I lost part of me when I lost all of you, now I'm lost\n\n\n\nI don't wanna come crawling, crawling\n\nBut I catch myself falling, falling\n\nI could try to stop calling, calling just to show myself\n\nDid you keep my sweater, sweater\n\nDid you read my letter, letter?\n\nDo you know me better, better than I know myself?\n\nDo you know me better, better than I know myself?\n\nThan I know myself?\n\n\n\nI don't wanna wait any longer for the feeling of getting stronger\n\nMaybe that's why I wrote a song for you\n\n'Cause you know me better, better than I know myself"
