(reach the end)\n\nWith your mind unscathed?\n\nLurking in the shadows\n\nSecrets of the past (secrets of the past)\n\nLocked behind the masks\n\n(Locked behind the masks)\n\nAt our masquerade\n\n\n\nFollow me to the horror show\n\nYou're the attraction we're watching\n\nIts me, who is in control\n\nHolding on to the puppet strings\n\n\n\nBehind friendly eyes\n\nThere's a face that hides\n\nComing for your life,\n\nYou won't last\n\nCloser we're alive,\n\nIts time to survive\n\nAnother five nights\n\nWelcome back\n\n\n\nWill you live to see the light?\n\nIts another five long nights\n\nCan you out run your demise?\n\nIts another five long nights\n\nInnocence slowly unwinds\n\nIts another five long nights\n\nWill your final hour chime?\n\nIts another five long nights\n\n(Tick, tick, tick)\n\n\n\nBehind friendly eyes\n\nThere's a face that hides\n\nComing for your life,\n\nYou won't last\n\nCloser we're alive,\n\nIts time to survive\n\nAnother five nights\n\nWelcome back\n\nWelcome back\n\nWelcome back\n\n\n\nBack again so soon?\n\nWe've all been preparing for you\n\nAnother jump\n\nAnother scare\n\nSpend the night with us\n\nIf you dare\n\nWelcome back"
