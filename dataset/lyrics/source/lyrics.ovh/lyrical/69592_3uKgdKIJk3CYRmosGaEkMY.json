  "lyrics": "My ship has sails that are made of silk\r\nThe decks are trimmed with gold\r\nAnd of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold\r\nMy ship's aglow with a million pearls\r\nAnd rubies fill each bin\n\nThe sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in\n\n\n\nWhoa, ship comes in\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nI can wait the years 'til it appears\n\nOne fine day one spring\n\nBut the pearls and such they won't mean much\n\nIf there's missing just one thing\n\n\n\nI do not care if that day arrives\n\nThat dream need never be\n\nIf the ship I sing doesn't also bring\n\nMy own true love back to me\n\n\n\nIf the ship I sing doesn't also bring my true love, oh no\n\nBring my true love, oh\n\nBring my true love\n\nBack to me\n\nOh-oh-oh oh oh oh"
