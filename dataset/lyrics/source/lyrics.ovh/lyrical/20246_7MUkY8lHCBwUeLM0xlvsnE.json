  "lyrics": "I had a dream\r\nWe met as friends\r\nYou smiled as you reached out and shook my hand\r\nSaid clocks are playing drums\r\nGotta find the measure\r\nClean fingernails won't find no treasure\n\nWon't find no treasure\n\n\n\nPromises could never pay for medicine\n\nTo fix the wounds of how you've been\n\nSpread so thin\n\nSo dance and twirl\n\nYour broken dreams could fill the world\n\nSo do just like they tell you, girl\n\nSpread so thin\n\n\n\nI had a dream\n\nWe came to see her\n\nIt wasn't like it was yesterday\n\nUh huh, we'll see\n\nWe'll grab a beer\n\nThey're might be pain but I have no fear\n\nI have no fear\n\n\n\nPromises could never pay for medicine\n\nTo fix the wounds of how you've been\n\nSpread so thin\n\nSo dance and twirl\n\nYour broken dreams could fill the world\n\nSo do just like they tell you, girl\n\nSpread so thin\n\n\n\nAnd promise to\n\nWhenever love is blinding you\n\nWhat you've got inside of you\n\nDon't spread so thin"
