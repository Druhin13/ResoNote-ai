  "lyrics": "Awake and breathing\r\nWe halt and catch fire\r\nTiming's never what the soul desires\r\nI belong somewhere on the outside\r\nWill the signal survive when the circuit breaks?\n\nTelling me something\n\nIt's telling me something\n\nIt's telling me something now\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nYou're dragging me away from the promise land\n\nYou fucked me up\n\nBut I refuse to let you kill what I am\n\n\n\nSame old feeling\n\nWhen we halt and catch fire\n\nTired of all this reused desire\n\nYou belong somewhere\n\nJust not in my mind\n\nI won't burn myself out\n\nJust to keep you warm\n\n\n\nIt's telling me something\n\nIt's telling me something\n\nIt's telling me something now\n\nThe pressure is rising\n\nI feel it inside me\n\nI need you to hear me now\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nYou're dragging me away from the promise land\n\nYou fucked me up\n\nBut I refuse to let you kill what I am\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nYou're dragging me away from the promise land\n\nYou fucked me up\n\nBut now I know who I am\n\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to do?\n\nYou're dragging me away from the promise land\n\nYou fucked me up\n\nBut I refuse to let you kill what I am"
