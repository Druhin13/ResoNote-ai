  "lyrics": "I really wish that I could be there to tell you that I'm sorry\r\nAnd hug your head into my chest so you can feel my heartbeat\r\nAnd maybe after a couple of awkward stares\r\nWe could shoot the breeze genuinely and depart from there\r\nBut then again I know that I'm alone and there's a reason\r\nBut the silence is the hardest part of it I've had to breathe in\n\nI stopped hanging with my friends soon as I got with you\n\nAnd now it's sort of bittersweet that all I've really got is you\n\nMake some way for the lonely man\n\nSee I was jaded already to love and we blew it, the only chance\n\nYou're probably right that I hate women\n\nThe snakes in 'em are way venomous\n\nYou could be anyone, that is a major mistake\n\nFinish, I'm done, give it a few days\n\n'Cause we're so fucking codependent\n\nOn each other that it soothes pain\n\nSo oblivious we're living where the noose hands\n\nBut hey, at least we're not alone tonight\n\nWhat do you say?\n\n\n\nYou don't love me\n\nYou just hate being alone\n\nYou just hate being alone\n\nYou'd rather be unhappy\n\nI don't love you\n\nI just hate being alone\n\nI just hate being alone\n\nI'd rather be unhappy\n\n\n\nYou probably won't even get to listen\n\nTo the songs that I write for you, in light of our position\n\nBut I could sense that ever since you've gotten separated\n\nFrom your husband and you went to me that you were captivated\n\nIt didn't take you very long at all to like me\n\nDespite that I smoked ice in front of you\n\nOn the night we first kicked it\n\nI was imperfection at its greatest, but it didn't matter to you\n\nI was there and you would take it\n\nChatted all night with you and actually was nice to you\n\nI never did imagine that I'd get to share my life with you\n\nBut it was good for me 'cause you were my disabler\n\nBut soon as tables got to turning you were my enabler\n\nAnd there were so many moments I wanted out of it\n\nThe only conversation that we had is when we'd shout a bit\n\nI think we liked it too, that's pretty fucked up\n\nI feel like my blood's sucked, this isn't what love does\n\n\n\nYou don't love me\n\nYou just hate being alone\n\nYou just hate being alone\n\nYou'd rather be unhappy\n\nI don't love you\n\nI just hate being alone\n\nI just hate being alone\n\nI'd rather be unhappy\n\n\n\nI hate it when you're there\n\nI hate it when you're gone\n\nI hate it that I had to turn this shit into a song\n\nI never want to be with you again\n\nPsyche, I'm only joking baby\n\nYou know that I love you to no end\n\nMaybe we can find some common ground and work it out\n\nOn second thought, you need to get the fuck out of my house\n\nSo I can call you five minutes later, bring you back\n\nYou can kiss me, and then flip your shit\n\nAnd then we can relax\n\n\n\nYou don't love me\n\nYou just hate being alone\n\nYou just hate being alone\n\nYou'd rather be unhappy\n\nI don't love you\n\nI just hate being alone\n\nI just hate being alone\n\nI'd rather be unhappy"
