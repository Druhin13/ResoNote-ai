  "lyrics": "Sometimes we know, sometimes we don't\r\nSometimes we give, sometimes we won't\r\nSometimes we're strong, sometimes we're wrong\r\nSometimes we cry\r\nSometimes it's bad when the going gets tough\n\nWhen we look in the mirror and we want to give up\n\nSometimes we don't even think we'll try\n\nSometimes we cry\n\n\n\nWell we're gonna have to sit down and think it right through\n\nIf we're only human what more can we do\n\nThe only thing to do is eat humble pie\n\nSometimes we cry\n\n\n\n'Fore they put me in a jacket, and they take me away\n\nI'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray\n\nSometimes we live, sometimes we die\n\nSometimes we cry\n\n\n\nSometimes we can't see anything straight\n\nSometimes everybody is on the make\n\nSometimes it's lonely on the lost highway\n\nSometimes we cry, sometimes we cry\n\n\n\nGonna put me in a jacket, and take me away\n\nI'm not gonna fake it like Johnnie Ray\n\nSometimes we live, sometimes we die\n\nSometimes we cry, sometimes we cry\n\n\n\nSometimes we live, sometimes we die\n\nSometimes we cry, sometimes we cry"
