  "lyrics": "There’s a man in a cheap suit\r\nHolding a beer can\r\nStanding on his back porch\r\nLooking out past the highway\r\nThe sun is going down\n\nIn a field of dry corn\n\nAnd the slider keeps catching\n\nAnd the screen is torn\n\n\n\nHis tie is loose\n\nHis socks are thin\n\nHe shakes the can once\n\nAnd goes back in\n\n\n\nHe walks between his children\n\nAnd the television glow\n\nTo the kitchen for another\n\nTo the living room alone\n\n\n\nThere’s a knock-off Gibson\n\nLeaning in the corner\n\nWhere he left it the last time\n\nHe felt like this\n\n\n\nHe pushes on the tuners\n\nWith his eyes shut tight\n\nRuns out a figure with his left hand\n\nUntil the chord sounds right\n\n\n\nWhen he sings he looks so far away\n\nLike there’s something\n\nHe almost remembers\n\nAnd doesn’t know how to say\n\n\n\nI see him from the doorway\n\nI see that look in his eye\n\nAnd I know I’m going to go there\n\nWhere my father’s dreams lie"
