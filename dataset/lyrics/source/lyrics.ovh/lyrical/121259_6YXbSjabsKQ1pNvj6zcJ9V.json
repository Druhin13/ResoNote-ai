  "lyrics": "Oh my drunken southern star\r\nHow you tried to hide in darkness\r\nSlipped from orbit\r\nNow you’re dangerously close\r\nCome out, come out\n\nFrom all your hiding out\n\nWe’ll dig in our heels\n\nSalute the battlefields\n\nWhere our broken hearts were born, ohh\n\n\n\nAnd the storm clouds are thirsty\n\nI can see them bursting, watch them gathering light\n\nAnd the walls in the bedroom now are pounding out\n\nWere we broken open baby, maybe just a crack\n\nSwore I heard you whisper that you preferred us like that, ohh\n\n\n\nMy broken open child\n\nWere we thirsty, thorned with wild eyes\n\nStill, we are slaves to the sirens of the salty sea\n\nOhh, ohh, ohh, ohh"
