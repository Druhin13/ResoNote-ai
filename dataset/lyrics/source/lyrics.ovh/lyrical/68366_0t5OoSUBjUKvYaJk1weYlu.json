  "lyrics": "What a day for a day dream,\r\nWhat a day for a day dreamin' boy.\r\nAnd I'm lost in a day dream,\r\nDreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy.\r\nAnd even if time ain't really on my side,\r\nIt's one of those days for taking a walk outside.\n\nI'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun,\n\nAnd fall on my face in somebody's new mowed lawn.\n\n\n\nI've been havin' a sweet dream,\n\nI've been dreamin' since I woke up today,\n\nIt's starring me in my sweet dream,\n\n'Cause she's the one that makes me feel this way,\n\nAnd even if time is passin' me by a lot,\n\nI couldn't care less about the dues you say I got.\n\nTomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load.\n\nA pie in the face for being a sleepy bull toad.\n\n\n\nAnd you can be sure that if you're feelin right\n\nA day dream will last a long time into the night.\n\nTomorrow at breakfast you may prick up your ears,\n\nOr you may be dreamin' for a thousand years."
