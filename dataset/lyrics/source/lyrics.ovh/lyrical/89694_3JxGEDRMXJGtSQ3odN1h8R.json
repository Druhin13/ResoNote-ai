  "lyrics": "I gotta take a little time\r\nA little time to think things over\r\nI better read between the lines\r\nIn case I need it when I'm older\r\nNow this mountain I must climb\n\nFeels like a world upon my shoulders\n\nThrough the clouds I see love shine\n\nIt keeps me warm as life grows colder\n\n\n\nIn my life there's been heartache and pain\n\nI don't know if I can face it again\n\nCan't stop now, I've traveled so far\n\nTo change this lonely life\n\n\n\nI wanna know what love is\n\nI want you to show me\n\nI wanna feel what love is\n\nI know you can show me\n\n\n\nI'm gonna take a little time\n\nA little time to look around me\n\nI've got nowhere left to hide\n\nIt looks like love has finally found me\n\n\n\nIn my life there's been heartache and pain\n\nI don't know if I can face it again\n\nCan't stop now, I've traveled so far\n\nTo change this lonely life\n\n\n\nI wanna know what love is\n\nI want you to show me\n\nI wanna feel what love is\n\nI know you can show me\n\n\n\nI wanna know what love is\n\nI want you to show me\n\nAnd I wanna feel, I want to feel what love is\n\nAnd I know, I know you can show me\n\n\n\nLet's talk about love\n\nI wanna know what love is, love that you feel inside\n\nI want you to show me, and I'm feeling so much love\n\nI wanna feel what love is, no, you just cannot hide\n\nI know you can show me, yeah\n\n\n\nI wanna know what love is, let's talk about love\n\nI want you to show me, I wanna feel it too\n\nI wanna feel what love is, I want to feel it too\n\nAnd I know and I know, I know you can show me\n\nShow me love is real, yeah\n\nI wanna know what love is..."
