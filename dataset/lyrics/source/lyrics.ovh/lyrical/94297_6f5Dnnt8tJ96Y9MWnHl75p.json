  "lyrics": "Highways and Broken Hearts\r\n\r\nHe never knew their names and never really cared\r\nLying to himself, he was never just a young kid scared\r\nLiving on his own with no one to hold on to\n\nNowhere to go and nothing to do\n\nBut lie awake and pray that one-day\n\nSomeone will come his way\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nAll He knows are\n\nHighways and broken hearts, late nights and old guitars\n\nWondering where you are, you're so far away\n\n\n\nHis shoes are worn and tired and not at their best\n\nLike a gypsy never sure where he's going next\n\nSuperficial friends, and girls with glazed over eyes\n\nIt's a good time, but just for the night\n\nThen off he'll go to maybe Mexico\n\nThen off through Colorado\n\n\n\nAll He knows are\n\nHighways and broken hearts, late nights and old guitars\n\nWondering where you are, you're so far away\n\n\n\nStaring through the walls of that motel room\n\nReflecting on his days, the route he's seemed to choose\n\nWill good outshine bad, can he turn this thing around\n\nShould he drop to his knees, just give up now\n\nBegging for release in the night\n\nHas he gone too far to fight?\n\n\n\nAll He knows are\n\nHighways and broken hearts, late nights and old guitars\n\nWondering where you are, you're so far away"
