  "lyrics": "Well it was out in California by the San Diego sea\r\nThat was when I was taken in and it left its mark on me\r\nYeah she nearly drove me crazy with all those China toys\r\nAnd I know she really didn't mean a thing to any of those sailor boys\r\nLouisiana rain is falling at my feet\n\nBaby I'm noticing the change as I move down the street\n\nLouisiana rain is soaking through my shoes\n\nI may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina put out its arms for me\n\nRight up until everything went black somewhere on Lonely Street\n\nAnd I still can't quite remember who helped me to my feet\n\nThank God for a love that followed the angel's remedy\n\n\n\nLouisiana rain is falling just like tears\n\nRunning down my face, washing out the years\n\nLouisiana rain is soaking through my shoes\n\nI may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge\n\n\n\nWell I never will get over this English refugee\n\nSinging to the jukebox in some all-night beanery\n\nYeah he was eating pills like candy and chasing them with tea\n\nYou should have seen him lick his lips, that old black muddied beak\n\n\n\nLouisiana rain is falling at my feet\n\nBaby I'm noticing the change as I move down the street\n\nLouisian rain is soaking through my shoes\n\nI may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge\n\n\n\nLouisiana rain is falling just like tears\n\nRunning down my face, washing out the years\n\nLouisiana rain is soaking through my shoes\n\nI may never be the same when I reach Baton Rouge"
