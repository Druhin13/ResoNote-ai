  "lyrics": "Close my eyes, I cannot see\r\nSudden blindness upon me\r\nThis ray of light is so unknown\r\nFrom womb of darkness I am born\r\nLift the veil of shade forever\r\nLike a candle that's within me\n\nI receive the gift of sight\n\nAnd rise!\n\nThis life is a storm that rages on\n\nFire, wind, the earth and sea are one\n\nI sing before you all like\n\nOrpheus with torch in hand\n\nThe cave it still lies within\n\nLike a never ending sin\n\nPaint these walls with crimson light\n\nThe phoenix now is taking flight\n\nStare back to the abyss\n\n\"Hades who rules there shall grant thee salvation\"\n\nLike the snow that brings December\n\nI am the spark that sets the flame of truth alight\n\nAnd fight!\n\nAnd this life is the pain of being born\n\nMan, child and woman all are one\n\nI sing before you allâ€¦\n\nLike Orpheus"
