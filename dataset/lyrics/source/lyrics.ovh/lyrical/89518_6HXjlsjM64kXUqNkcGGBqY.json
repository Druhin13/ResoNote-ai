  "lyrics": "When I was a young boy I was scared of growing up\r\nI didn’t understand it but I was terrified of love\r\nFelt like I had to choose but it was outta my control\r\nI needed to be saved, I was going crazy on my own\r\nTook me years to tell my mother, I expected the worst\r\nI gathered all the courage in the world\n\n\n\nShe said, \"I love you no matter what\n\nI just want you to be happy and always be who you are\"\n\nShe wrapped her arms around me\n\nSaid, \"Don’t try to be what you’re not\n\nCause I love you no matter what\"\n\nShe loves me no matter what\n\n\n\nI got a little older wishing all my time away\n\nRiding on the pavement, every sunny day was grey\n\nI trusted in my friends then all my world came crashing down\n\nI wish I never said a thing cause to them I’m a stranger now\n\n\n\nI ran home I saw my mother, it was written on my face\n\nFelt like I had a heart of glass about to break\n\n\n\nShe said, \"I love you no matter what\n\nI just want you to be happy and always be who you are\"\n\nShe wrapped her arms around me\n\nSaid, \"Don’t try to be what you’re not\n\nCause I love you no matter what\"\n\nShe loves me no matter what\n\n\n\nNow I’m a man and I’m so much wiser\n\nI walk the earth with my head held higher\n\nI got the love that I need\n\nBut I was still missing one special piece\n\nMy father looked at me\n\n\n\nHe said I love you no matter what\n\nI just want you to be happy and always be who you are\n\nHe wrapped his arms around me\n\nSaid, \"Don’t try to be what you’re not\n\nCause I love you no matter what\"\n\nHe loves me no matter what\n\n\n\nThey love me no matter what"
