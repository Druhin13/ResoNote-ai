  "lyrics": "We fumbled around\r\nPushing stones through the mesh\r\nWe reap cause we sow\r\nIt's a song to the flesh\r\nI had to dream in monochrome\r\nA lie that they've spun\n\nI think I hear heaven calling me home\n\nWe're like poised from the sun\n\n\n\nTwo lives, later I'll find\n\nBut everybody's comin round here\n\nRaise arms, I've got a hand to call mine\n\nI'm still out to find my peace of mind\n\n\n\nI'm runnin on a heartbeat, I can feel it in my blood flow\n\nEyes up when they call me, cause we're fighting in the good war\n\nSet me off with a godspeed, then I slam on the backdoor\n\nYou and I are gonna die free, cause we're fighting in the good war\n\n\n\nWe fumble around\n\nWe're pushing homes from the nest\n\nWe're too far to be found, fighting in the good war\n\nI had to speak in the protocol\n\nI was biting my tongue\n\nSometimes I hear hell calling me home\n\nIt's such a lie that we've spun\n\n\n\nI'm runnin on a heartbeat, I can feel it in my blood flow\n\nEyes up when they call me, cause we're fighting in the good war\n\nSet me off with a godspeed, then I slam on the backdoor\n\nYou and I are gonna die free, cause we're fighting in the good war\n\n\n\nI'm runnin on a heartbeat, I can feel it in my blood flow\n\nEyes up when they call me, cause we're fighting in the good war\n\nSet me off with a godspeed, then I slam on the backdoor\n\nYou and I are gonna die free, cause we're fighting in the good war\n\n\n\nBig lies, we cry, no side of the mind\n\nI rise, you rise, no time to disappear"
