  "lyrics": "Selflessly hiding all emotions inside\r\nChilly and dry, New England style\r\nNobody's figured out my twelve fatal flaws\r\nWho's keeping score? Who wins that war?\r\nI'm busting out\r\nAnd I know everyone agrees\n\n\n\nCaring is carting bad ideas to the dump\n\nAnd taking my time, taking my time\n\nHey, this microphone was turned on all along\n\n\n\nI tried returning all that stuff to the store\n\nBut then I bought more, then I bought more\n\nI'm done explaining all these reckless displays\n\nHard to defend, I'm in a haze\n\nOld stories told\n\nIn brand-new clothes I bought today\n\n\n\nKindness is killing off my unfinished dreams\n\nAnd walking away, just walking away\n\nHey, this microphone was turned on all along\n\n\n\nCaring is carting bad ideas to the dump\n\nAnd taking my time, taking my time\n\nHey, this microphone was turned on all along"
