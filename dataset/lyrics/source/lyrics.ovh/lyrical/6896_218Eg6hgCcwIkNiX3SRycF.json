  "lyrics": "Muscled, black with steel-green eye \nswishing through the rye grass \nwith thoughts of mouse-and-apple pie. \nTail balancing at half-mast. \n...And the mouse police never sleeps \nlying in the cherry tree. \n\nSavage bed foot-warmer of purest feline ancestry. \n\nLook out, little furry folk! \n\nHe's the all-night working cat. \n\nEats but one in every ten \n\nleaves the others on the mat. \n\n...And the mouse police never sleeps \n\nwaiting by the cellar door. \n\nWindow-box town crier; \n\nbirth and death registrar. \n\nWith claws that rake a furrow red \n\nlicensed to multilate. \n\nFrom warm milk on a lazy day \n\nto dawn patrol on hungry hate. \n\n...No, the mouse police never sleeps \n\nclimbing on the ivy. \n\nWindy roof-top weathercock. \n\nWarm-blooded night on a cold tile"
