  "lyrics": "This feels like deja vu\r\nCause I'll never see you again but I'll run my way back to you\r\nCause you're always on my mind\r\nBaby I only wish you give me one more try\r\nCause every day that goes by\n\nI try my best to just forget about you\n\nBut every time I try, I wanna be around you\n\nBecause every time I'm lost\n\nI thank my stars I found you\n\nI hate to admit it but I guess that I need you\n\nSo this is a preview\n\n\n\nOf my love to you\n\nOf my love to you\n\nOf my love to you\n\nI hate to admit it but I guess that I need you\n\nSo this is a preview\n\n\n\nYou get under my skin, I get so over you\n\nAnd all that's irrelevant, true\n\nCause everytime you touch my lips\n\nNobody has ever made me feel like this\n\nAnd every day that goes by\n\n\n\nI try my best to just forget about you\n\nBut every time I try, I wanna be around you\n\nBecause every time I'm lost\n\nI thank my stars I found you\n\nI hate to admit it but I guess that I need you\n\nSo this is a preview\n\n\n\nOf my love to you\n\nOf my love to you\n\nOf my love to you\n\nI hate to admit it but I guess that I need you\n\nSo this is a preview\n\n\n\nI try my best to just forget about you\n\nBut every time I try, I wanna be around you\n\nBecause every time I'm lost\n\nI thank my stars I found you\n\nI hate to admit it but I guess that I need you\n\nSo this is a preview\n\n\n\nOf my love to you\n\nOf my love to you\n\nOf my love to you\n\nI hate to admit it but I guess that I need you\n\nSo this is a preview"
