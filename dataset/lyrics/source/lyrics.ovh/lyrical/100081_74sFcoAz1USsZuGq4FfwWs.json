  "lyrics": "So fire up at the little things\r\nWe're caught up in the webs we weave\r\nThen we pluck on the smallest string\r\nWe're pressing on our bruise just to feel something\r\nIn the night that you walked out again\r\nAnd the light with the yellow tinge\n\nYour goodbyes, they never meant a thing\n\n'Cause we're pressing on our bruise just to feel something\n\n\n\nSo let go of me\n\nAnd everything we should have seen\n\nAnd you'll go and be everything you need to be\n\nAnd I honestly wish that I could say I've let you go\n\n\n\nSo fire up at the little things\n\nWe're caught up in the webs we weave\n\nThen we pluck on the smallest string\n\nWe're pressing on our bruise just to feel something\n\n\n\nAnd I wish that I had called you up in the December sun\n\nYou would have come\n\nAnd the words, they would have raised themselves up from my heart to tongue\n\nI think we're done\n\nPressing on our bruise just to feel something\n\n\n\nSo let go of me\n\nAnd everything we should have seen\n\nAnd you'll go and be everything you need to be\n\nAnd I honestly wish that I could say I've let you go\n\n\n\nI haven't seen the sun in days\n\nA broken home, a broken place\n\nYour coffee sitting on the counter, cold\n\nI can't throw it away\n\nAnd all the things we haven't done\n\nAnd all the battles never won\n\nI need your light to help me see again\n\n\n\nSo let go of me\n\nAnd everything we should have seen\n\nAnd you'll go and be everything you need\n\nSo let go of me\n\nAnd everything we should have seen\n\nAnd you'll go and be everything you need to be\n\nAnd I honestly wish that I could say I've let you go\n\nI want to let you go\n\nI wish I'd let you go\n\nI need to let you go"
