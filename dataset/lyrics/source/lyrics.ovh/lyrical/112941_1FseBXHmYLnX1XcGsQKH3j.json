  "lyrics": "Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger\r\nWith an open heart, open container\r\nI've got a stack of mail and a tall can\r\nIt's a shower beer it's a payment plan\r\nThere's helicopters over my head\r\nEvery night when I go to bed\n\nSpending money and I earned it\n\nWhen I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it\n\n\n\nDo you feel ashamed\n\nWhen you hear my name\n\n\n\nI asked you\n\n\"How is your sister? I heard she got her degree\"\n\nAnd I said, \"That makes me feel old\"\n\nHe said, \"What does that make me?\"\n\nI asked you\n\n\"How is playing drums?\"\n\nYou said it's too much shit to carry\n\n\"And what about the band?\"\n\nYou said they're all getting married\n\n\n\nDo you feel ashamed\n\nWhen you hear my name\n\n\n\nAnyway, don't leave a stranger\n\nAnyway, don't leave a stranger\n\nDon't be a stranger"
