  "lyrics": "Crooked old barefoot shovin' it across the outdoor dancefloor like you ain't got no sense\r\nHis new girlfriend found her a pretty good fella I guess that she's into rednecks\r\nOh my, no lie: y'all better hold on tight\r\nWe got a lot of ice-cold cheap beer flowin' around here, lord wish we had all night\r\nBut the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone\n\n\n\nWatch out for Miss comin' up to you, leanin' up on you, wanna take you home tonight\n\nShe got herself a six-foot-fiver Mac Truck driver comin' in hot, and he loves to fight\n\n\n\nOh my, no lie: she'll put it on you in a minute\n\nIn a double-wide cheetah print silk sheet queen-size, it's sure cozy while you're in it\n\nBut the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone, son\n\n\n\nOh my, no lie: there ain't no turnin' back now\n\nAnd you can't un-think what you already done\n\nAnd the moonlight's gonna burn out\n\nAnd the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone\n\nYeah the mornin's gonna come and it won't be no fun for anyone"
