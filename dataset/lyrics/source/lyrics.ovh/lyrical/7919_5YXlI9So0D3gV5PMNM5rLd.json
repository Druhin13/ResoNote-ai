  "lyrics": "This heaven that I'm holding: it ain't heaven-sent\r\nIt ain't [?], it's a fast train headed south\r\nThis heaven that I'm holding, it's not for everyone\r\nIt's not for everyone, it's a lonely setting sun\r\nThis heaven that I'm holding is golden and bright\n\nThis heaven that I'm holding is holdin' me tight tonight\n\n\n\nThis heaven that I'm holding don't cost much of anything\n\nYou can hear the angels sing empty songs with broken wings\n\nWhen a heart grows weary start lookin for the light\n\nAnd when there's nothin' else to try, you keep searchin' for a different high\n\n\n\nThis heaven that I'm holding is golden and bright\n\nThis heaven that I'm holding is holdin' me tight tonight"
