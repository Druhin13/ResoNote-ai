  "lyrics": "In the place that you call home\r\nOthers call their own\r\nSo you make a plan to go\r\nAnd you don't let anyone know\r\nAnd you cross the sea\r\nAnd you're hidin' in the trees\n\nAnd you've crossed some made up line\n\nBut what does it mean?\n\n\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nAnd it's changing everyday\n\nWhole world is just clay\n\nIt's changing everyday\n\nWhole world is just clay\n\n\n\nHelicopters fly around\n\nIn the nighttime sky\n\nAnd you meet the man by the fence\n\nAnd it feeds to your discontent\n\nSearchers in the night with the flashlights\n\nAs they head to your dreams\n\nBut what does it mean?\n\n\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nYou're a refugee\n\nAnd it's changing everyday\n\nWhole world is just clay\n\nIt's changing everyday\n\nWhole world is just clay"
