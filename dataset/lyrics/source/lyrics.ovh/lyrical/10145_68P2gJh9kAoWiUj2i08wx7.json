Ain't cool with that\n\nNo I can't relax, no I can't relapse\n\nLemme bounce back, where my soldiers at?\n\nWith they shoulders back, whatchu lookin' at?\n\nNo cook crack with that black girl magic\n\nI'm smokin' Spike Lee joint, she just gotta have it\n\nEverybody wanna be black, it's so tragic\n\nEverytime I wear clothes, I'm stoppin' traffic\n\nEverybody here knows I am the baddest\n\nDon't worry where my hair grow, pussy the fattest\n\nMy nookie, my ass, tits, I'm never average\n\nOut the fuckin' window, your career in a casket\n\nI'ma hard pill to swallow, fried chicken got my eyes low\n\nThese bitches so greasy, that's why I don't never follow\n\nStyle fuckin' dated like I'm starin' at a dino-\n\nSoarin' like a spaceship I'm just faded off the Fronto"
