  "lyrics": "And we were grown on the same round little blue dot\r\nAlthough the answers will take their time and they're spending most of it\r\nSo could it be that the nightmare is upon us\r\nAnd heavy hearts can't decide when they’ve had enough\r\nSo they’re burning out cold\n\nIt's a steady fall from the pinnacle to the bedrock\n\nAnd so we set out to bring back that miracle love\n\nI said I’d never do you harm but I was wrong\n\nIt’s so hard to believe but I barely can see where we came from\n\n\n\nWe got carried away\n\nAll the love that I was blind to\n\nAnd I made my mistakes\n\nAnd I laid them all beside you\n\nWe got carried away\n\nSo much love that I was blind to\n\nAnd I made my mistakes\n\nAnd you put them all behind you\n\nCan we bring back that miracle love?\n\nCan we bring back that miracle love?\n\n\n\nAnd I would guess that we’re losing sight of the right way\n\nAnd though the end is in my mind\n\nI doubt talking's gonna do much for me\n\nSomeday, someday\n\nA long time from now\n\nWe’ll be remembered as the ones who couldn’t hold it down\n\nWho couldn't fight back for it\n\n\n\nWe got carried away\n\nAll the love that I was blind to\n\nAnd I made my mistakes\n\nAnd I laid them all beside you\n\nWe got carried away\n\nSo much love that I was blind to\n\nAnd I made my mistakes\n\nWill you put them all behind you?\n\nCan we bring back that miracle love?\n\nWon’t you bring back that miracle love?\n\n\n\nCan we bring back that miracle love?\n\nOh bring back that miracle love\n\nBring back that miracle love\n\nBring back that miracle love"
