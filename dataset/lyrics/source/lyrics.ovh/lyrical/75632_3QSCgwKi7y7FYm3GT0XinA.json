  "lyrics": "My heart is sad and lonely\nFor you I sigh, for you dear only\nWhy haven't you seen it\nI'm all for you body and soul\n\nI spend my days in longing\n\nAnd wondering why it's me you're wronging\n\nI tell you I mean it\n\nI'm all for you body and soul\n\n\n\nI can't believe it\n\nIt's hard to conceive it\n\nThat you'd turn away romance\n\nAre you pretending\n\nIt looks like the ending\n\nUnless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear\n\n\n\nMy life a wreck you're making\n\nYou know I'm yours for just the taking\n\nI'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul\n\n\n\nMy life a wreck you're making\n\nYou know I'm yours for the very taking\n\nI'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul"
