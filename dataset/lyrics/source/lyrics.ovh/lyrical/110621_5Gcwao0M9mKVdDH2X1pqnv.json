  "lyrics": "Perfect shapes over my eyes, when I go outside\r\nAnd the evening bleeding sunlight\r\nWhen I see you, I'm so happy, I cry\r\nI don't ever want to hear the goodbye\r\nHold me, I'm sinking in\n\n\n\nSo another summer in my room\n\nPicking up the jasmine perfume\n\nWhen I woke up, I could hear the tern fly\n\nIf I said that I was leaving, I lied\n\n\n\nHold me, I'm sinking in\n\nJust beginning again"
