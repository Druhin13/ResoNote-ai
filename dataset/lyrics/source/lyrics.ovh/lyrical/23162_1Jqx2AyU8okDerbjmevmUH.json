  "lyrics": "If you, if you could return\r\nDon't let it burn, don't let it fade\r\nI'm sure I'm not being rude but it's just your attitude\r\nIt's tearing me apart, it's ruining everything\r\nI swore, I swore I would be true\r\nAnd honey, so did you\n\nSo why were you holding her hand?\n\nIs that the way we stand?\n\nWere you lying all the time?\n\nWas it just a game to you?\n\n\n\nBut I'm in so deep\n\nYou know I'm such a fool for you\n\nYou have me wrapped around your finger\n\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\nDo you have to? Do you have to?\n\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\nLinger, linger, do you have to let it linger?\n\nLinger, linger, do you have to let it linger?\n\nLinger, linger\n\nDo you have to? Do you have to?\n\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\n\n\nOh, I thought the world of you\n\nI thought nothing could go wrong\n\nBut I was wrong, I was wrong\n\nIf you, if you could get by\n\nTrying not to lie\n\nThings wouldn't feel so confused\n\nI wouldn't feel so used\n\nBut you always really knew\n\nI just wanna be with you\n\n\n\nBut I'm in so deep\n\nYou know I'm such a fool for you\n\nYou have me wrapped around your finger\n\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\nDo you have to? Do you have to?\n\nDo you have to let it linger?\n\nLinger, linger, do you have to let it linger?\n\nLinger, linger, do you have to let it linger?\n\nLinger, linger\n\nDo you have to? Do you have to?\n\nDo you have to let it linger?"
