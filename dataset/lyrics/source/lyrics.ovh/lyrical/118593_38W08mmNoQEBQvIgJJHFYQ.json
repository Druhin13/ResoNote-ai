  "lyrics": "She don't hit me up anymore, no\r\nThings that were fun just ain't fun anymore, no\r\nSix in the morning I know I should go home\r\nBut I, uh- huh\r\nHigh as fuck and the clock's screaming tick-tock\r\nGirls in the suburbs singing Smiths songs\n\nI know that it's wrong\n\nI don't know what I'm doin, but\n\n\n\nBaby one day it'll all make sense\n\nBaby one day it'll all make sense\n\nBaby one day it'll all make sense\n\nBut I just don't know when\n\nAnd it feels like the end\n\nAnd all of my friends\n\nSaid\n\n\n\nThat I should get my mind off of the wrong things\n\nI should probably tear off all my heart strings\n\nYou can't pull them no more, no\n\nCan I pass out on your floor\n\nCan I have a little more so I can\n\nHear you babble on some more about him\n\nAbout him, yeah\n\nI got a little water bottle full of whiskey\n\nOh you lookin pretty like a model you should kiss me\n\nYou so cool with your drugs and your ripped jeans\n\nI'm with you, but you ain't with me, no, no\n\n\n\nBaby one day it'll all make sense\n\nBut I just don't know when\n\nAnd it feels like the end\n\nAnd all of my friends, said\n\n\n\nThat I should get my mind off of the wrong things\n\nI should probably tear off all my heart strings\n\nYou can't pull them no more"
