  "lyrics": "Someday somebody's gonna stop and look\r\nOr scratch their head and say\r\n'What happened to him? It's been a while since I heard that name'\r\nThe story goes\r\nI told one last joke, bum one more smoke\r\nAnd then paid my tab and just disappeared one day\n\n\n\nI've kicked around this old town long enough to see\n\nThe one's who left to soon\n\nAnd the ones who didn't know when to leave\n\n\n\nAnd when it's my turn to jump off this carousel\n\nI'm gonna ride on that white horse and run like hell\n\nBe thankful for the friends I've made\n\nThe hungry years, the glory days\n\nGive 'em one more song and lay this guitar down\n\nThat's how I'm going out\n\n\n\nWhen I go\n\nI'll be another page torn away, a memory made\n\nAnother ghost on music road\n\nBut I can say I gave it hell, I rang the bell\n\nBut I'll know when there's no more dreams to chase\n\n\n\nAnd when it's my turn to jump off this carousel\n\nI'm gonna ride on that white horse and run like hell\n\nBe thankful for the friends I've made\n\nThe hungry years, the glory days\n\nGive 'em one more song and lay this guitar down\n\nThat's how I'm going out\n\nThat's how I'm going out\n\n\n\nAnd when it's my turn to jump off this carousel\n\nI'm gonna ride on that white horse and run like hell\n\nNo slowing down, no looking back\n\nLet the credits roll and fade to black\n\nGive 'em one more song and lay this guitar down\n\nGive 'em one more song and lay this guitar down\n\nThat's how I'm going out\n\n\n\nSomeday somebody's gonna stop and look\n\nOr scratch their head and say\n\n'What happened to him? It's been a while since I heard that name'"
