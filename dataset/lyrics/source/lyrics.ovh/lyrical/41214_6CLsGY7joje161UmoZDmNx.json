  "lyrics": "And they don't care about love\r\n'Cause they're hollow in the heart\r\nAnd they don't care about us\r\nAnd we know below what we don't know what we haven't got\r\nWe belong at the frontier\n\nWhere we open the world and become what is between us\n\nWe belong at the frontier\n\nWhere we open the world and become what's at the heart of us\n\n\n\nAnd they're not livin' in love\n\nThough they hold control, we don't know what we haven't got\n\nAnd no one's helping us up\n\nThey go \"Oh no! What goes on below the shallow part?\"\n\n\n\nWe belong at the frontier\n\nWhere we open the world and become what is between us\n\nWe belong at the frontier\n\nWhere we open the world and become what's at the heart of us\n\n\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\n\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\n\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love\n\nYou and me: in love, in love, in love"
