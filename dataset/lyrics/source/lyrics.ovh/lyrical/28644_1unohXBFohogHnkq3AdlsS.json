  "lyrics": "Leaving it all unsaid\r\nKeeping it quiet instead\r\nYou know that I won't explain\r\nCause I've grown to need this pain\r\nYou tell me it's good for now\r\nI'll heal but I don't know how\n\nSafe in the way we touch\n\nBut it hurts to feel this much\n\n\n\nAnd they say that it goes so I hope that it shows\n\nYou are all that I've known for a while\n\nAnd I'm coming up slow and I'm thinking of home\n\nBut you're all that I've known for a while\n\n\n\nSpending our nights awake\n\nSilent for both our sake\n\nHold me until I'm strong\n\nCause I'll miss this when you're gone\n\n\n\nAnd they say that it goes so I hope that it shows\n\nYou are all that I've known for a while\n\nAnd I'm coming up slow and I'm thinking of home\n\nBut you're all that I've known for a while\n\n\n\nI'd tell you but I can't\n\nPlease don't make this hard\n\nTime is all I want\n\nSo speak the words I won't\n\n\n\nAnd they say that it goes so I hope that it shows\n\nYou are all that I've known for a while\n\nAnd I'm coming up slow and I'm thinking of home\n\nBut you're all that I've known for a while"
