  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Death Of You & I par Isaac Gracie\r\nRunning into one another, outside a cafe in Paris\nYou say you're living with your brother, because he lets you stay rent free\nBut you can't speak the local language and so no matter how you try\nYou say you don't know how you'll manage, since the death of you and I\n\nRunning into one another, feelings come flooding back again\nYou say you've been with many others, but that it never tastes the same\nNow you don't know how to feel wiping tears from your eyes\nNothing ever felt so real, since the death of you and I\n\n\nSince the death of you and I\nSince the death of you and I\nSince the death of you and I\n\nRunning into one another, you say you want to run and hide\n'Cause you still haven't recovered from the day that our love died\nSo am I wasting all my time tryna make it up to you\nWell if you said that you were mine there's not a thing that I won't do\n\nSince the death of you and I\nSince the death of you and I\nSince the death of you and I\n\n\nSaid that my sins couldn't be forgiven\nPraying at the altar but the gods don't listen\nLife without your love ain't a life worth living\nTry to go alone but there's something missing\nI got nothing left since the death of you and I\n\nDrunk most nights with no direction\nSobriety bites like your last rejection\nIt's been seven long days since the resurrection\nRemember when your body was my confection\nI got nothing left since the death of you and I\n\nSince the death of you and I\nSince the death of you and I\nSince the death of you and I"
