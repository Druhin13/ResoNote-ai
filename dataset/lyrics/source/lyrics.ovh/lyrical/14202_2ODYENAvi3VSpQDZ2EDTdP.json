  "lyrics": "I woke up bleeding in the crock of a tree\r\nTV blaring on the wall above the coffee machine\r\nCar wash waiting room outside Pasadena\r\nI'm sitting waiting for my deus ex machina\r\nAnd I'm forever changed by this chemical burn\r\nSkin on my fingers peeling, making way for my new form\n\nI grip the steering wheel and picture my angel\n\nClimbing out the hospital window\n\nLeaving tubes in a tangle\n\nBlood on my angel's lips blends in with his make up\n\nHe's off the premises before his brain's had time to wake up\n\nPeeling off bandages to unfold his wings\n\nThe doctors said they'd have to stay on for another three weeks\n\nFuck it baby, let 'em bruise, let 'em break\n\nBut bleed, let 'em bleed\n\n\n\nI'm doing ninety, got to get there and hold him\n\nIf we can make it across the state line then baby, we're golden\n\nLet the law pronounce its' petty assertions\n\nThey've been outsmarted by a couple of urchins\n\nAnd they hurt you bad, man\n\nThey hurt me too\n\nBut I'm not about to sit here and watch as they\n\nSuck the blood from my wound \n\nSuck the blood from my wound\n\nSuck the blood from my wound\n\nSuck the blood from my wound\n\nOhh man\n\n\n\nWrap half the money in your hospital garment\n\nWe'll stash the rest inside the red Camero's secret compartment\n\nEven the deepest wounds will heal over time\n\nI'll run my fingers over your scars and yours over mine\n\nThey'll never find us if we turn off our phones\n\nWe're off the grid, we're off our meds\n\nWe're finally out on our own\n\nNow I see colour coming back in your cheeks\n\nAngel, don't fight it\n\nTo them you know we'll always be freaks \n\nTo them you know we'll always be freaks\n\nWe'll always\n\n\n\nPark for the night north west of Baton Rouge\n\nAcross the parking lot you're stretching the one wing you can move\n\nI let you walk as long as fear will allow\n\nI never loved you more than I love you now\n\nAnd then we're back on the road before the sun's even up\n\nWe're making time, we're making progress\n\nBut progress towards what?\n\nYour fallen feathers fill up two shopping bags\n\nThe future's breathing down the neck of the past\n\nAnd the sun throws a shit-eating shine on the moon\n\nAnd I'm not about to wait for them to come\n\nSuck the blood from my wound \n\nSuck the blood from my wound\n\nSuck the blood from my wound\n\nSuck the blood from my wound\n\nA plague on both your houses \n\nA plague on both your houses"
