  "lyrics": "It kills me not to know this\r\nBut I've all but just forgotten\r\nWhat the color of her eyes were\r\nAnd her scars or how she got them\r\nAs the telling signs of age rain down\r\nA single tear is droppin'\n\nThrough the valleys of an aging face\n\nThat this world has forgotten\n\n\n\nThere is no reconciliation\n\nThat will put me in my place\n\nAnd there is no time like the present\n\nTo drink these draining seconds\n\nBut seldom do these words ring true\n\nWhen I'm constantly failing you\n\nLike walls that we just can't break through\n\nUntil we disappear\n\n\n\nSo tell me now\n\nIf this ain't love\n\nThen how do we get out?\n\n’Cause I don't know\n\n\n\nThat's when she said\n\n\"I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you\n\nWhile there's still something left to save.\"\n\nThat's when I told her\n\n\"I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer\n\nFor the questions that you still have.\"\n\n\n\nAnd the day pressed on like crushing weights\n\nFor no man does it ever wait\n\nLike memories of dying days\n\nThat deafen us like hurricanes\n\nBathed in flames we held the brand\n\nUncurled the fingers in your hand\n\nPressed into the flesh like sand\n\nNow do you understand?\n\n\n\nSo tell me now\n\nIf this ain't love\n\nThen how do we get out?\n\n’Cause I don't know\n\n\n\nThat's when she said\n\n\"I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you\n\nWhile there's still something left to save.\"\n\nThat's when I told her\n\n\"I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer\n\nFor the questions that you still have.\"\n\n\n\nOne thousand miles away\n\nThere's nothing left to say\n\nBut so much left that I don't know\n\nWe never had a choice\n\nThis world is too much noise\n\nIt takes me under\n\nIt takes me under once again\n\n\n\nI don't hate you\n\nI don't hate you, no\n\n\n\nSo tell me now\n\nIf this ain't love\n\nThen how do we get out?\n\n’Cause I don't know\n\n\n\nThat's when she said\n\n\"I don't hate you, boy, I just want to save you\n\nWhile there's still something left to save.\"\n\nThat's when I told her\n\n\"I love you, girl, but I'm not the answer\n\nFor the questions that you still have.\"\n\n\n\nI don't hate you\n\nI don't hate you\n\nI don't hate you\n\nI don't hate you, no"
