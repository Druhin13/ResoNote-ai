  "lyrics": "There was a time when I saw you\r\nThere's someone that I could hold onto\r\nI wanted to be there for you\r\nNow we're slowly grown apart\r\nYou had the whole world headed to you\r\nBut you started to change and threw it away\n\nFor a lie that was caught in the shadows\n\nPulling you away from home\n\nLeaving all you've ever known\n\n\n\nYou ran away\n\nAnd you lost your way\n\nYou ran away\n\nAnd it's not the same\n\n\n\nAfter all of these things that we've been through\n\nNow I feel like I don't even know you\n\nYou're a shell of the man that I once knew\n\nTrying to find his way back home\n\nHoping that the ache will go\n\n\n\nYou ran away\n\nAnd you lost your way\n\nYou ran away\n\nAnd it's not the same\n\n\n\nMy broken hope\n\nAnd he's really gone\n\nYou've come and you've gone\n\nNow I'm all alone\n\n\n\nMy broken hope\n\nAnd he's really gone\n\nYou've gone and you've come\n\nNow I'm all alone\n\n\n\nYou ran away\n\nAnd you lost your way\n\nYou ran away\n\nAnd it's not the same"
