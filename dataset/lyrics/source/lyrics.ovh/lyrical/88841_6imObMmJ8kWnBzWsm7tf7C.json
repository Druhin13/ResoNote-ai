  "title": "Crazy on You",
  "lyrics": "We may still have time We might still get by Every time I think about it I want to cry With the bombs and the devils And the kids keep coming Nowhere to breathe easy...no time to be young But I tell myself that I'm doing alright There's nothing left to do tonight but go crazy on you My love is the evening breeze touching your skin The gentle sweet singing of leaves in the wind The whisper that calls, after you in the night And kisses your ear in the early light You don't need to wonder, you're doing fine And my love, the pleasure's mine Let me go crazy on you Wild man's world is crying in pain What're you going to do? I was a willow last night in my dream I bent down over a clear running stream I sang you the song that I heard up above And you keep me alive with your sweet, flowing love"
