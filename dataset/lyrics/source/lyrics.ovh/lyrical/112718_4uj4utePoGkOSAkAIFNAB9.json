  "lyrics": "I keep on runnin' from my own life\r\nBecause I'd rather not fight\r\nIt chases me soon as it's daylight\r\nAnd well through the night\r\nBut I can never stop wasting all my time with you\n\nNow I can never stop wasting all my time with you\n\n\n\nI feel over when I don't see ya\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\nI feel over when I don't see ya\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\n\n\nMy mind, my mind\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\nMy mind, my mind\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\n\n\nI'm tryin' to make myself feel okay\n\nI know I won't be today\n\nAll of these thoughts will never go away\n\nI guess I shouldn't complain\n\n\n\nBut I can never stop wasting all my time with you\n\nNow I can never stop wasting all my time with you\n\n\n\nI feel over when I don't see ya\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\nI feel over when I don't see ya\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\n\n\nMy mind, my mind\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\nMy mind, my mind\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\n\n\nI feel over when I don't see ya\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\nI feel over when I don't see ya\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\n\n\nMy mind, my mind\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind\n\nMy mind, my mind\n\nStay in the back of my, back of my mind"
