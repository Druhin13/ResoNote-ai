  "lyrics": "You see us as winners, when do we ever win?\r\nWhen am I even good enough? Acknowledge your friends\r\nSometimes things get broken and we argue again\r\nSpent the last 20 minutes holdin' the side of my head\r\nI'll explain it as takin' cash on culture from the poachers\r\nScopin' everything I have, ignorin' all the bullshit that made me mad\n\nKillin' coral reefs, smoking weed too fast\n\nAlmost got skipped, bitch I read too fast, I don't bleach my past\n\nThese are the titles G's supposed to have, cold in the summer\n\nSweatin' bullets out on Flatbush Ave\n\nSpirit like I got a platinum plaque, modern acrobat, the mass effect\n\nI sharp shoot 'em, make them tap the mat, so accurate\n\nWe represent the illest seniors, small demeaners\n\nTellin' lies inside this room of cheaters\n\nEven at the stage of a fetus, I reclaim to repeat this to all my demons\n\nThat's pigeon-holin' your genius and feedin' right into weakness\n\nHow can he write his thesis? He don't believe in Jesus\n\nSweetness, I'm almost speechless, for our future, egregious\n\nWe gotta pick up the pieces shawty, I'm familiar with pain\n\nUsed to play by myself when they considered it lame\n\nDo this thing by yourself, nothing is ever obtained\n\nIntroverted but Iâ€™m emergin' the spark to the flames\n\nI won't harp on a thing\n\nI won't causin' the blame, but it's hard to obtain\n\n\n\nI wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash\n\nWanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag\n\nWanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big\n\nRaining champagne for, 'long as I could get a swig\n\nI wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash\n\nWanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag\n\nWanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big\n\nRaining champagne for, 'long as I could get a swig\n\n\n\nA real friend'll kill you if you asked him to\n\nInstead of stabbing on the back of you\n\nJust trying to get ahead\n\nBut you can't spend a dime if you work yourself dead\n\nWe are so deep in love with the sinner but not the sin\n\nHow could she turn my king size into a waterbed? Damn, I'm just sayin'\n\nKick her out the crib and scream, \"Baby come back\"\n\nThen kick her out again, I'm just crazy like that\n\nBitches fall in love with a nigga out of his mind\n\nAnd I fall so deep into lust with a chick with a big behind\n\nMy ex left cause I ain't got no hits\n\nI heard her new boyfriend lumpin' her up with his fists\n\nBut hey, you got what you asked for, I'm petty as shit\n\nThat's some food for thought, I let you do the dishes\n\n\n\nI wanna see you winnin', I wanna see you get the cash\n\nWanna see you finish, don't wanna see you wave the flag\n\nWanna see you try hard, wanna see you do it big\n\nRaining champagne for, 'long as I could get a swig\n\n\n\nI'm Faizon with no love, give love with a golden glove\n\nI'm the man with a golden gun, black man under golden sun\n\nI'm shinin', Jack Nicholson, wishes where my nickels went\n\nKisses on my mistletoes, did I have a Christmas? No\n\nBut I had a misses though, believe me, shoulda vacay'd in Tahiti\n\nWishing you were dyin' with me, sweet as hugs and diabetes\n\nLeave me, love me, touch me, cut me, lustin'\n\nFuck me, busty, dusty, old and crusty\n\nBaby, do you mind if I revise what's in your mind?\n\nYou see my call declined because a certain point in time\n\nI'm hopin' every line it hits like millimeter nine\n\nYou beggin' me to change, that is a penny to a dime\n\nThe realness in my spirit always gets you every time\n\nOptimistic like Optimus, we ain't even reached our prime\n\nRoses are red and violence leads to violins\n\nEnd of discussion, I hope that we could still be friends\n\n\n\nDon't take this shit for granted, I'm blessed just like my granny\n\nShout out my Uncle Mannie, hey, hi, I hope you winnin'\n\nGia, I hope you listenin'\n\nAnd Tommy hold your head, man fuck your heart condition\n\nRihanna like my big momma, we call Penny Big Momma\n\nShe like a hundred years old, that's a real old timer\n\nUncle Karl you in a better place\n\nJust know the pictures that you took gon' live forever and a motherfuckin' day\n\nRest in peace Uncle Rob, we miss you, bless your heart\n\nRihanna and my grandmomma took me in from the start\n\nAunt Marie beatin' cancer, givin' everything she had\n\nMy cousin Calvin showed me swag, my cousin Hebrew showed me straps\n\nMe and J used to hustle, he had that white, I had that green\n\nWho got them pills? We in 4-3, lil niggas on the scene\n\nGod said four knives, that's one for each pocket\n\nGonna need nine lives if you get out of pocket\n\nIf I see cousin James, I'll knock his eyes out his socket\n\nDiamante hold me down like I ain't got a wallet\n\nRest in peace to my sweet great-grandma Grace\n\nI wish my momma was alive, if I could see her face\n\nMy grandfather used to say when I fucked up\n\nThat I was just like my momma, tough love\n\nI wish I could see my kid way more than I could\n\nMy baby momma holdin' grudges but the court will do good"
