  "lyrics": "I let the days go by\r\nThinking of you most of the time\r\nWe go on with our lives\r\nMeet me here further down the storyline\r\nThink of all the good we had\n\nThe memory stays and I go\n\nLook at all the beauty we made\n\nCarefully raised by us both\n\nListen to the words I sing\n\nFor this occasion I chose\n\nFor you to have and hold\n\nUntil we meet, until I fold\n\n\n\nShut the door, shut my eyes for a while\n\nMy work here is completed now\n\nSomething grows in my body and mind\n\nAnd you itched 'til you reached my insides\n\n\n\nShut out the world, shut your mouth for a while\n\nListen to the scenery of sound\n\nI can live in this conception of mine\n\nLive and die on my self-built ground\n\n\n\nThink of all the good we had\n\nThe memory stays and I go\n\nLook at all the beauty we made\n\nCarefully raised by us both\n\nListen to the words I sing\n\nFor this occasion I chose\n\nFor you to have and hold\n\nUntil we meet, until I fold\n\n\n\nSwitch the lights off\n\nI travel tonight\n\nPack my dearest things\n\nAnd leave at first light\n\nHeading home to where days are nights\n\nHeading back to where I was found\n\nYou and I, we know about\n\nWe know about the hole in the floor\n\nAnd you know I will never stop\n\nWill never stop wanting more\n\n\n\nThink of all the good we had\n\nThe memory stays and I go\n\nLook at all the beauty we made\n\nCarefully raised by us both\n\nListen to the words I sing\n\nFor this occasion I chose\n\nFor you to have and hold\n\nUntil we meet, until I fold\n\n\n\nI let the days go by\n\nThinking of you most of the time\n\nWe go on with our lives\n\nMeet me here further down the storyline"
