  "lyrics": "You see that stranger coming up the hill\r\nThough you don't recognise him, I know your preacher will\r\nGot a voice like sugar, sugar in your teeth\r\nAnd he could sing it when it's alright\r\nSing it sweeter than me\n\nBlind your eyes\n\nSteal your tongue\n\nHe'll take it when you're old, but\n\nBut he likes 'em young\n\n\n\nOh my, oh my baby\n\nDevil's gonna get you if I don't first\n\nTake my, take my body\n\nTake my body and do your worst\n\nOh my, oh my baby\n\nDevil's gonna get you if I don't first\n\nTake my, take my body\n\nTake my body and do your worst\n\n\n\nWhen you see that stranger coming on the track\n\nI can hear your mama just calling you back\n\nHit you like a fever, fever dream\n\nAnd he touch you like a thief\n\nAnd leave your pockets clean\n\n\n\nBlind your eyes\n\nSteal your tongue\n\nHe'll get you when you're old now\n\nBut he likes 'em young\n\n\n\nOh my, oh my baby\n\nDevil's gonna get you if I don't first\n\nTake my, take my body\n\nTake my body and do your worst\n\nOh my, oh my baby\n\nDevil's gonna get you if I don't first\n\nTake my, take my body\n\nTake my body and do your worst\n\n\n\nOh my, oh my baby\n\nDevil's gonna get you if I don't first\n\nTake my, take my body\n\nTake my body and do your worst\n\nOh my, oh my baby\n\nDevil's gonna get you if I don't first\n\nTake my, take my body\n\nTake my body and do your worst"
