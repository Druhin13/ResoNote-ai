  "lyrics": "You asked me what family is\r\nAnd I think of family as community\r\nI think of the spaces where you don't have to shrink yourself\r\nWhere you don't have to pretend or to perform\r\nYou can fully show up and be vulnerable\r\nAnd in silence, completely empty and\n\nThat's completely enough\n\nTo show up, as you are, without judgment, without ridicule\n\nWithout fear or violence, or policing, or containment\n\nAnd you can be there and you're filled all the way up\n\nWe get to choose our families\n\nWe are not limited by biology\n\nWe get to make ourselves\n\nAnd we get to make our family"
