  "lyrics": "I could never had a devastating loss\r\nWatch over me when my bell rings\r\nI would rather be lucky than small\r\nThrow me a rope so I can blow rings\r\nI'm exhausted by romance\r\nI was lost in the languages\n\nGuardian Angel, what do you see?\n\nI have tripped on all your signs\n\nI would rather give blood than make art\n\nYou're so mysterious when your light shines\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI was lost in the languages\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI was lost, I was lost in the languages\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nTeachers, teachers for 25 years\n\nMy head balloon you tried to pierce my ears\n\nPreachers, preachers in the minister well\n\nThey can't compare to the wind in ourselves\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI was lost in the languages\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI was lost, I was lost in the languages\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI'm exhausted by romance\n\nI'm exhausted by romance"
