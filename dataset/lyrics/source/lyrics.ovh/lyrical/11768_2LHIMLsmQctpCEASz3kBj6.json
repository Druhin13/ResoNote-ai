  "lyrics": "They met at two\r\nBy the gulls and ships of mining\r\nAnd left too soon\r\nEvery storm cloud's silver lining\r\nWhat some people do\n\nSome people fall in love\n\nIt's wonderful, too\n\nBut sometimes too soon for love\n\n\n\nYou wore a frown\n\nFilled with lowered expectations\n\nAnd swam around\n\nIn Tylenols and masturbation\n\n\n\nBut some people do\n\nSome people fall in love\n\nAnd it's wonderful, too\n\nBut sometimes too soon for love"
