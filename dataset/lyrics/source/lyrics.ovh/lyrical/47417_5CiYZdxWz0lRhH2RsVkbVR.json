  "lyrics": "Turn the torch on the night I was born\r\nThe room I grew up in and grew into a new skin\r\nThe night will spark the enlightenment\r\nAnd I know you, you made a difference\r\nThe dark will usher the light in\n\nAnd I know this, this is different\n\n\n\nTen years perished the thoughts have been buried\n\nThey learned to escape me and now I don’t think\n\nI lost my father, I’m not my brothers\n\nThey’re in there somewhere, you can’t choose your demon\n\n\n\nThe night will spark the enlightenment\n\nAnd I know you, you made a difference\n\nThe dark will usher the light in\n\nAnd I know this, this is different\n\n\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong\n\nI was wrong"
