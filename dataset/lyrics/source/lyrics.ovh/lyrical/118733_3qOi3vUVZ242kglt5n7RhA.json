  "lyrics": "Out where the creek turns shallow and sandy\r\nAnd the moon comes skimmin' away the stars\r\nThe wind in the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops\r\nStraight into my arms\r\nStraight into my arms\n\nI'm riding hard carryin' a catch of roses\n\nAnd a fresh map that I made\n\nTonight I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul\n\nAnd dance on its grave\n\nAnd dance on its grave\n\n\n\nIt's been a long time comin', my dear\n\nIt's been a long time comin' but now it's here\n\n\n\nWell my daddy he was just a stranger\n\nLived in a hotel downtown\n\nWhen I was a kid he was just somebody\n\nSomebody I'd see around\n\nSomebody I'd see around\n\n\n\nNow down below and pullin' on my shirt\n\nI got some kids of my own\n\nWell if I had one wish in this god forsaken world, kids\n\nIt'd be that your mistakes would be your own\n\nYea your sins would be your own\n\n\n\nIt's been a long time comin', my dear\n\nIt's been a long time comin' but now it's here\n\n\n\nOut 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia\n\nWhere the sword of Orion sweeps\n\nIt's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires\n\nAnd you breathin' in your sleep\n\nYou breathin' in your sleep\n\n\n\nWell there's just a spark of campfire burning\n\nTwo kids in a sleeping bag beside\n\nI Reach 'neath your shirt, lay my hands across your belly\n\nAnd feel another one kickin' inside\n\nI ain't gonna fuck it up this time\n\n\n\nIt's been a long time comin', my dear\n\nIt's been a long time comin' but now it's here\n\nIt's been a long time comin', my dear\n\nIt's been a long time comin' but now it's here"
