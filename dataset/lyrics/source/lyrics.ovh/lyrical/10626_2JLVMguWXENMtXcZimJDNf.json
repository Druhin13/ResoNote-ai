  "lyrics": "I know it sounds crazy\r\nBut I know what I saw\r\nWhen the sun came up on the brightest day\r\nFrom the darkest night of all\r\nI saw the Man die\n\nThey laid Him in the tomb\n\nAnd I know â€˜cause I saw it with my own two eyes\n\nWhen He stepped into the room\n\n\n\nAnd I've seen too much, too much to deny\n\nI've seen too much, too much to say goodbye\n\n\n\nSo we scattered to the four winds\n\nTo tell them what we know\n\nBut I get so tired and the doubt creeps in\n\nAnd the doubt won't let me go\n\n\n\nAnd it's all I can do to get up in the morning\n\nAll I can do to stand up in the storm\n\nWhen all I remember's the passing form\n\nA glimpse of the glory before it was gone\n\nAnd I get so tired of this ridicule\n\nBut I cannot deny what I know to be true\n\n'Cause I've seen too much\n\nWhat else can I do?\n\nWhere else can I go, Lord?\n\nWhere else can I go... but to You?\n\n\n\nI've seen too many faces\n\nAll shining like the sun\n\nI've seen too many skies on fire\n\nLike the face of the Holy One\n\n\n\nI've seen too many eyes wide open\n\nThat once were so blind\n\nAll burning with the beauty of the same love\n\nThe same love that opened mine\n\n\n\nAnd I've seen too much, too much to deny\n\nI've seen too much, too many points of light\n\nI know too much, I saw the scars and touched His skin\n\nThat's how it was, and I cannot hold it in\n\n\n\nI've seen so much that cannot be explained\n\nAnd I realize it's a mystery of faith\n\nBut my friend was dead and He walked out of the grave\n\nAnd I knew the world would never be the same\n\nI saw too much, when I looked into the eye\n\nOf the One I love and the One who loves me\n\nAnd there was nowhere left to hide\n\n\n\nI've seen too much, too much to deny\n\nI've seen too much, too much to say goodbye\n\nToo many points of light, too much to say goodbye"
