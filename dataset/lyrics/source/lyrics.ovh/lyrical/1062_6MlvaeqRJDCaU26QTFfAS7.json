  "lyrics": "We shed tears for movie scenes\r\nNo real fears, fake feelings\r\nIt's a sentimental wasteland\r\nWe're young enough to lose teeth\r\nBut not old enough for enemies\r\nStill steering with both hands\n\n\n\nWe were just kids living young and naïve\n\nRunning round streets like the King and the Queen\n\nGas light flicker in your eye, what are hopeless dreams?\n\nStaying out waiting 'til they call off the search\n\nChewing gum, cherry coke until our brains burned\n\nA sugar drunk high, we were the only ones, oh\n\n\n\nThe bitter taste of nicotine\n\nStill alive on my coat and jeans\n\nBut you were the light that I saw standing in front of the sun\n\nYou were the girl on the hill singing all night, all night\n\n\n\nWe were just kids living young and naïve\n\nRunning round streets like the King and the Queen\n\nGas light flicker in your eye, what are hopeless dreams?\n\nStaying out waiting 'til they call off the search\n\nChewing gum, cherry coke until our brains burned\n\nA sugar drunk high, we were the only ones\n\n\n\nMaybe never be found\n\nLike a drop in the ocean\n\nIf we ever grow up\n\nWe'll be gone in the moment\n\n\n\nSugar drunk high\n\nSugar drunk high\n\nSugar drunk high\n\nWe were living on a sugar drunk high\n\nSugar drunk high\n\nSugar drunk high\n\nSugar drunk high\n\n\n\nWe were just kids living young and naïve\n\nRunning round streets like the King and the Queen\n\nGas light flicker in your eye, what are hopeless dreams?\n\nStaying out waiting 'til they call off the search\n\nChewing gum, cherry coke until our brains burned\n\nA sugar drunk high, we were the only ones\n\n\n\nMaybe never be found\n\nLike a drop in the ocean\n\nIf we ever grow up\n\nWe'll be gone in the moment"
