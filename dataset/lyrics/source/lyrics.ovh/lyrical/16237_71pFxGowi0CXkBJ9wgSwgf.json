  "lyrics": "You're a good woman and a good friend\r\nYou got a good heart even when it's busted and bent\r\nLipstick and perfume, under gram queen\r\nWearing loneliness like a costume for the whole world to see\r\nAnd if your money runs out\n\nAnd your good looks fade\n\nMay your kindness remain\n\nOh, may your kindness remain\n\n\n\nBroke on a barstool, throwin' your paycheck away\n\nOn overpriced booze, slots, and valet\n\nFortune might buy diamonds, all shiny and new\n\nBut it can't buy you happiness or love, that is true\n\n\n\nAnd if your money runs out\n\nAnd your good looks fade\n\nMay your kindness remain\n\nOh, may your kindness remain\n\n\n\nThe richest of people\n\nAren't rich with Elvis, cars, or fame\n\nNo they're not rich with something\n\nThat can be bought or arranged\n\nNo, it's kindness that makes them beautiful\n\nAnd a kind heart don't cost a dime\n\nIt's a gif that keeps giving\n\nFor the rest of your life\n\n\n\nAnd if your money runs out\n\nAnd your good looks fade\n\nMay your kindness remain\n\nOh, may your kindness remain\n\nMay your kindness remain\n\nOh, may your kindness remain"
