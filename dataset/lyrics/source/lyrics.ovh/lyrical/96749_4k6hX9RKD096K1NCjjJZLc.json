  "lyrics": "Patience could've done us well\r\n'Cause I could tell that all we lack was presence\r\nAnd I would've fell, you could've helped\r\nBut here’s to being honest\r\nNeither of us knew what we wanted\n\nBut all we knew is that we cared\n\nStill all we painted was a moment\n\n\n\nAnd when I walked away\n\nI left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me\n\nAnd when I walked away\n\nI left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me\n\nYou’re so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers\n\nWe'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground\n\nAnd then the path would wash away, wash away\n\n\n\nLook\n\nAnd I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'\n\nAnd I really hope you still want me the way I want you\n\nAnd it really feels like this shit been on autopilot\n\nAnd it's a bitch you want me\n\nThe bitch I am, but not the chick you want\n\nResidual damage left in place of what was beautiful\n\nExcuses only work when what we've done is still excusable\n\nYou let the truth unfold\n\n\n\nBut still, cheers to being honest\n\nNeither of us knew what we wanted\n\nBut all we knew is that we cared\n\nStill all we painted was a moment\n\n\n\nAnd when I walked away\n\nI left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me\n\nAnd when I walked away\n\nI left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me\n\nYou’re so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers\n\nWe'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground\n\nAnd then the path would wash away, wash away\n\n\n\nYou are a vision of perfection\n\nIn my eyes, I was caught up in a blessing\n\nDidn't realize how it wasn't fair to compare\n\nAll the things I know that I've been through\n\nAs if you didn't have anything that you went through\n\nI treated you like medicine, but I guess I wasn't listening\n\nAnd you tried to explain that you had hurt and pain, too\n\nBut as long as I felt better, then it was all good\n\nBut we wasn't good, so convinced that things were understood\n\nMeanwhile, I had baggage to unpack, and I just had to admit that\n\nStill dealing with the battles, feeling so inadequate\n\nAnd I know that I shoulda stayed\n\nBut at the time, it felt like I had to quit\n\nAnd I know that you probably thinking\n\nJust I ain't thinking 'bout myself\n\nBut you still playing in my head to this day talking 'bout\n\n\n\nYou could've helped\n\nBut still, cheers to being honest\n\nNeither of us knew what we wanted (No)\n\nBut all we knew is that we cared (Uh)\n\nStill all we painted was a moment (Ah)\n\n\n\nAnd when I walked away\n\nI left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me\n\nAnd when I walked away\n\nI left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me\n\nYou’re so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers\n\nWe'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground\n\nAnd then the path would wash away, wash away (Wash away)"
