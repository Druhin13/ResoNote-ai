(Haha)\n\nOh, I'm hungry and wasted and my hands are shaking\n\nI shouldn't be cooking, be spilling hot water\n\nIt still doesn't burn as much as the thought of you\n\n\n\nWish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you\n\nAt 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you\n\nBut some things you can't undo\n\nI wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers\n\nSo I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper\n\nBut somethings you can't undo\n\nAnd one of them's you\n\n\n\nBeen through every emotion\n\nRight now, I'm sad and broken\n\nLike the bottles on the floor, but I'm too buzzed to clean 'em up\n\nWish I could get a little un-drunk\n\nSo I could, I could un-love you\n\n\n\nWish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you\n\nAt 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you\n\nBut some things you can't undo\n\nI wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers\n\nSo I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper\n\nBut somethings you can't undo\n\nAnd one of them's you\n\n\n\nYou, you\n\nWish I could un-love you, you\n\nYou, you\n\nWish I could un-call you, you\n\nYou, you\n\nWish I could un-fuck you, you\n\nWish I could un-love you"
