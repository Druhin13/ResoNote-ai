  "lyrics": "We were kids\r\nLookin' out into nothin'\r\nLookin' for a way to get around the night\r\nWe were kids\r\nHoldin' out for a dream\r\nWe were born to be wild and free\n\nOr sit alone online\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna wait\n\nSit the other side of these flood lights\n\nDreaming up a way to escape\n\nAnyone around?\n\nGive me mission control, give me a sound on the radio\n\n\n\nStand up and be counted\n\nBefore we slip away out here\n\nBefore we slip away, slip away\n\nDon't ever doubt it\n\nEven if we're surrounded\n\nDon't wanna slip away, slip away\n\n\n\nSlip away (slip)\n\nSlip away (slip)\n\n\n\nWe were Kings\n\nWe were Queens of an empire\n\nWe were made out on the streets\n\nWe were all [?]\n\n\n\nSo, if we're gonna break\n\nIf we're gonna tumble in a gunfight\n\nPromise we'll be side by side\n\nSay you'll there when the school gets closed\n\nSay you'll be there when the rest don't show\n\n\n\nStand up and be counted\n\nBefore we slip away out here\n\nBefore we slip away, slip away\n\nDon't ever doubt it\n\nEven if we're surrounded\n\nDon't wanna slip away, slip away\n\n\n\nHigh on hope and high on fear\n\nWe were heartbreak of the year\n\nWe were stackin' up to fall\n\nWe were summers in the street\n\nWe were sunlight through the trees\n\nWe were born for silver screens\n\nWe were whispers in the dark\n\nWe were sleeping under stars\n\nSay all of this is ours\n\nWe were rollercoaster screams\n\n'Til our hearts burst at the seams\n\nWe're not gonna let it all [?]\n\n\n\nStand up and be counted\n\nBefore we slip away out here\n\nBefore we slip away, slip away"
