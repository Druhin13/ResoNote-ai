  "lyrics": "I've been trying not to come around\r\nBeing strung out on the kitchen floor\r\nYou know that when you are feeling down\r\nSomeone else is always feeling more\r\nI've been down a bit\n\nI've been down a bit\n\nI had my face pressed up against the wall\n\nWhen the only thing that's left is sound\n\nYeah it sounded like a total bore\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm dead\n\nThere's nothing going on in my head\n\nThere's nothing going on in my eyes\n\n\n\nI've been stuck inside the lost and found\n\nBeing left out only makes me want it more\n\nWhen you always try to cut me out\n\nWell I rumble from the rotten floor\n\n\n\nI've been down a bit\n\nI've been down a bit\n\nI had my face pressed up against the wall\n\nWhen the only thing left is sound\n\nYeah it sounded like a total bore\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm dead\n\nThere's nothing going on in my head\n\nThere's nothing going on in my eyes\n\n'Cause I'm dead\n\nThere's nothing going on in my head\n\nThere's nothing going on in my eyes\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know I sold my brain out today\n\nYeah everybody's saying it'll be okay\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm dead\n\nThere's nothing going on in my head\n\nThere's nothing going on in my eyes\n\n'Cause I'm dead\n\nThere's nothing going on in my head\n\nThere's nothing going on in my eyes"
