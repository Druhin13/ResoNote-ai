  "lyrics": "I'm jealous of the rain\r\nThat falls upon your skin\r\nIt's closer than my hands have been\r\nI'm jealous of the rain\r\nI'm jealous of the wind\r\nThat ripples through your clothes\n\nIt's closer than your shadow\n\nOh, I'm jealous of the wind, cause\n\n\n\nI wished you the best of\n\nAll this world could give\n\nAnd I told you when you left me\n\nThere's nothing to forgive\n\nBut I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was\n\nHeartbreak and misery\n\nIt's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way\n\nYou're happy without me\n\n\n\nI'm jealous of the nights\n\nThat I don't spend with you\n\nI'm wondering who you lay next to\n\nOh, I'm jealous of the nights\n\nI'm jealous of the love\n\nLove that was in here\n\nGone for someone else to share\n\nOh, I'm jealous of the love\n\n\n\nI wished you the best of\n\nAll this world could give\n\nAnd I told you when you left me\n\nThere's nothing to forgive\n\nBut I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was\n\nHeartbreak and misery\n\nIt's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way\n\nYou're happy without me\n\n\n\nAs I sink in the sand\n\nWatch you slip through my hands\n\nOh, as I die here another day\n\nCause all I do is cry behind this smile\n\n\n\nI wished you the best of\n\nAll this world could give\n\nAnd I told you when you left me\n\nThere's nothing to forgive\n\nBut I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was\n\nHeartbreak and misery\n\nIt's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way\n\nYou're happy without me\n\n\n\nIt's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way\n\nYou're happy without me."
