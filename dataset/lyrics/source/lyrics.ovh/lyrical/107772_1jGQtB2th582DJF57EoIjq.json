  "lyrics": "Oh, the weather outside is frightful\r\nBut the fire is so delightful\r\nAnd since there's no place to go\r\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\r\nIt doesn’t show signs of stopping\r\nSo I bought some corn for popping\n\nThe lights are turned way down low\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\n\n\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\n\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\n\nBut if you'll really hold me tight\n\nAll the way home I’ll be warm\n\n\n\nAnd the fire is slowly dyin'\n\nAnd, my dear, we're still goodbyin'\n\nBut as long as you love me so\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\nGo!\n\n\n\nWhen we finally kiss goodnight\n\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\n\nBut if you really grab me tight\n\nAll the way home, I'll be warm\n\nAll the way home, I'll be warm\n\n\n\nThe fire is slowly dyin'\n\nBut, my dear, we’re still goodbyin’\n\nAs long as you love me so\n\nLet it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\n\nYeah\n\nLet it snow!"
