  "lyrics": "I'm looking back\r\nNow thinking, maybe I was wrong\r\nI been so out of place and desperate for so long\r\nI wrote about it\r\nThink I made a billion songs\r\nBut nothing would ever heal the wound\n\nNo, nothing would ever seal the wound\n\nNo, nothing\n\n\n\nNow I gotta go\n\nI'm coming home, coming home\n\nIt's been too long\n\nIf they wanna know, tell 'em I went home\n\nComing home\n\n\n\nWe got greens and cherry pie\n\nEveryone ain't always nice\n\nWell that's because they love you right\n\nAnd bitches bark when they don't bite at all\n\nComing home\n\n\n\nCool it for the ride\n\nC'mon, just take your time\n\nKeep on, keep on holding, moving, moving\n\nGotta get it right\n\nI can't pause and rewind\n\nKeep on, keep on moving, moving\n\n\n\nI know, stop holding me back\n\nQuit pushing me forward\n\nKeep on moving, moving\n\nI move at my own pace, just leave me alone\n\n'Cause I'm too this and I'm too that\n\nI'm too skinny, I'm too fat\n\nI'm all good, 'cause where I'm at I keep it moving\n\nI'm the sweetest peach to fall\n\nBut some don't like peaches at all\n\nI'm too short and I'm too tall\n\nKeep it moving\n\n\n\nCool it for the ride\n\nC'mon, just take your time\n\nGotta get it right, I can't pause and rewind\n\nKeep on, keep on"
