  "lyrics": "Watch the stars shine through a telescope lost in time\r\nThe silver moon light will carry me through the night\r\nFor years I called the coastline\r\nNever knowing where I belong\r\nDriftng away falling into the frey\r\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\n\n\nWhat is your frequency? (Somebody save me)\n\nI'm begging please don't shut me out\n\nI need you desperately (Why can't you hear me?)\n\nListen in before I drop out\n\n\n\nHear the rain fall in the lullaby of the tide\n\nThe lightning storm calls in the valleys of the great divide\n\nThis lonely heart has no home\n\nWhere is the help I can hold on to?\n\nSinking below I continue to roam\n\nAlways in search of you\n\n\n\nWhat is your frequency? (Somebody save me)\n\nI'm begging please don't shut me out\n\nI need you desperately (Why can't you hear me?)\n\nListen in before I drop out\n\n\n\nSome day, I will find you\n\nTrust me I know\n\nWe are all lost souls\n\nSearching for connection\n\nPut the pain behind you\n\nResurface, find purpose\n\nRecognize the strength in your own reflection\n\n\n\nWhat is your frequency? What is your frequency?\n\nWhat is your frequency? (Somebody save me)\n\nI'm begging please don't shut me out\n\nI need you desperately (Why can't you hear me?)\n\nListen in before I drop out"
