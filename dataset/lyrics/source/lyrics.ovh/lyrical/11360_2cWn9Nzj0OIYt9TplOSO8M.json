  "lyrics": "Maybe you're a little fire\r\nYou've been drowning your own desires\r\nBut every time I see you smile, the heavens move\r\nSomeday you will make it out\r\nAnd you'll feel your heart break the sound\n\nBut if you're scared where prayers are found\n\nI'll be with you, alone in that room\n\n\n\nBe still my love\n\nI don't wanna tear you down\n\nEverybody knows my love\n\nEverybody breaks somehow\n\nDon't throw it all away my love\n\nI'll be your all for now\n\n\n\nSomeday you'll return to silence\n\nWith a thousand miles of cave inside us\n\nBut every time I feel the quiet\n\nIt echoes you\n\n\n\nSomeday you will make it out\n\nAnd you'll feel the walls tearing down\n\nIf there's a place where lost is found\n\nI'll wait for you, alone in that room\n\n\n\nBe still my love\n\nI don't want to tear you down\n\nEverybody knows my love\n\nEverybody breaks somehow\n\nDon't throw it all away my love\n\nI'll be your all for now\n\n\n\nI don't wanna run\n\nI don't wanna hide\n\nAll I've ever known echoes why\n\nListen to the well\n\nListen to the ground\n\nI just wanna fade under the sound\n\n\n\nI don't wanna run\n\nI don't wanna hide\n\nAll I've ever known echoes why\n\nListen to the well\n\nListen to the ground\n\nI just wanna fade under the sound\n\n\n\nUntil we drown"
