  "lyrics": "Heaven is a hole in the sky\r\nThe stars are cracks in the ceiling of night\r\nAnd I just keep watching them for a sign\r\nThat you'll be alright\r\n'Cause every time there's a knock on my door\n\nI fall to my hands and knees on the floor\n\n'Cause when your wreckage washes up on my shore\n\nYou're not like before\n\n\n\nAnd you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes\n\nBut I won't be the debris in your hurricane\"\n\n\n\nYou used to be such a delicate kid\n\nA lonely fish in a sea full of squid\n\nSo I can't blame you for leaving how you did\n\nYou just fell off the grid\n\n\n\n'Cause heaven is a hole in the sky\n\nAnd the stars are cracks in the ceiling of night\n\nBut you can't be your own alibi\n\nAs hard as you try\n\n\n\nIt's a tired refrain you're singing over and over again\n\nAs you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes\n\nBut I won't be the debris in your hurricane"
