  "lyrics": "How it rambles 'round the moon\r\nA let-go-of balloon\r\nNothing is forever, everything is soon\r\nAnd my father as he stands\r\nA perfect cartoon man\n\nHeavy-sighed and open-eyed, I heard him speak\n\n\n\nHold your head up high\n\nHold your head up high\n\n\n\nRise it up, it's fine terrain\n\nThe time will come again\n\nAnd misery's no rest for weary gentlemen\n\n\n\nSee that humankind is you\n\nLike all the rest, down to\n\nThe scratches on the album that you're singing to\n\n\n\nHold your head up high\n\nHold your head up high\n\n\n\nThrough the light and through the shadow\n\nI won't wait it out, wait it out\n\n\n\nHold your head up high\n\nHold your head up high\n\nHold your head up high\n\n\n\nBiting clovers in the lawn\n\nA solitary fawn\n\nUnderground, the new life thunders up and on"
