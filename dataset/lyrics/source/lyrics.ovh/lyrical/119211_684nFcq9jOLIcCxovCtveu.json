The table's set, come get it\n\nPain is a game then you better run with it, have fun with it, enjoy your suffering\n\nKernel panic, terminal rushin'\n\nEmpty the clip while your clip's still bufferin'\n\n\n\nLook in the eye of the violent and villainous\n\nWe are the murderous militants\n\nWe are the pirates that hide on the island invade or we wilding\n\nMarauding and murdering merchantmen\n\nWe have been cursed by the curs\n\nWe shooting first on our turf\n\nPay us our proper respect\n\nYou pray for your God to end the perverse\n\nHe sent the worst of the worst\n\nEvery death demon disperse\n\nWe put them all in a hearse\n\nWe put them under the earth\n\nWe are the savages ravaging hell\n\nDeath in the air, we relish the smell\n\nWe are the hand of the Lord\n\nWe are the hand with the sword\n\nTaking the head to the face\n\nWe are the sealers of fate\n\nWe are the fangs of the snake\n\n\n\nLet's go!\n\nHuh?\n\nHuh?\n\nLet's go!\n\nHuh?\n\nHuh?\n\nHuh?\n\n\n\nThe enemies of the state\n\nPardon me, your mistake\n\nSee, I'm raised to eat pain\n\nAppetite for sliced face\n\nMe and Mike mount the Hellcat\n\nArmed to the pearl-whites like yikes!\n\nTwenty cents gets your ghost ejected\n\nIt's free now, go to the light\n\nMe and Mike bring D'Lite to the knife fight\n\nGet twenty-nine grand sliced\n\nMe, I just take it light\n\nMight light twenty-nine grand up in a night\n\nTongue lash slash in defiance\n\nBorn to brawl boy, the bastard alliance\n\nHardy-harr, you a laugh, I'm a riot\n\nThat's not a brag, that's SCIENCE!\n\n\n\nBack from the bellows of hell\n\nBack from the back of a jail in the cell\n\nBack from the gun and the priest to the con and the creed\n\nBack to the streets from the East\n\nBack to the belly of beast\n\nBack to the place of my peace\n\nBack to me holding my piece\n\nAnything working disturbing that peace\n\nWill certainly meet the deceased, capiche?\n\nOh, why must I tell 'em again?\n\nWhat must I tell 'em, my friend?\n\nThat we are born into sin\n\nAnd we are worshiping murderers\n\nNothing but evil duplicitous men\n\nI know you heard of 'em all\n\nWe should just murder 'em all\n\nWe should just murder and ball\n\nWe dance on the ruins we looting from all of they palace's walls\n\n\n\nLet's go!\n\nHuh?\n\nHuh?\n\nLet's go!\n\nHuh?\n\nHuh?\n\nHuh?"
