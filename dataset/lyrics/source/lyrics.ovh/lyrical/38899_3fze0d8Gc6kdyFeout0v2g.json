  "lyrics": "I’m headed for the lights, headed for my city\r\nHeaded for my future if you’re not too busy\r\nMaybe you could ride with me, so pull up your todd britches\r\nGot that homicide sickness all I needs an eye witness\r\nWho can properly depict between skills and shit\r\nBetween real and fixed between deals and tricks\n\nA damn shame, my niggas won’t change for shit\n\nStill trapped behind chains and whips\n\nYo, these fucking cowards sit in towers\n\nBuilding idols you can follow\n\nKeep it catchy, keep it simple, keep it empty, keep it hollow\n\nI brush it off my shoulder and straighten up my collar\n\nI believe there’s a much higher power than that mighty dollar\n\nHere’s a letter to my efforts and the truth is enclosed\n\nOur enemies will flee when their troops are exposed\n\nAll the money and the fame, the jewels and the clothes\n\nWill never be able to heal the wounds on your soul\n\n\n\nTrust me I know at times it’s tough\n\nSee we all fall down\n\nBut it’s a must that we get back up\n\nAnd we will never fall, we’ll rise above it all\n\nI’m trying to tell you homie anything is possible\n\nOvercome any obstacle, ain't no way they’ll be stopping you\n\nYou know we’ll never fail, together we’ll prevail\n\nAnd I would never want to lose these scars\n\nThey remind me that life is hard but I’m still reaching for the stars\n\nAnd we will never fall, we’ll rise above it all\n\nI try to tell them like blocka blocka this is Viva La Raza\n\nLong live the people trust me they will never stop us\n\nAnd we will never fail, together we’ll prevail"
