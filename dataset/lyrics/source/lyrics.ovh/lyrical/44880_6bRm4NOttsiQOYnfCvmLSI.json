  "lyrics": "(Robert Lamm)\r\nFlying high, touch the sky\r\nGoing to places I never knew\r\nSo goodbye\r\nAnd hello, long ago\n\nI can see history\n\nStanding still, a mystery - if you will\n\nPardon me\n\nI'm away for the day\n\nFeels so good to be soaring\n\n'Cause L.A. was so boring\n\nGoodbye\n\nThere must be room for growing\n\nSomewhere else and I'm going\n\nGoodbye\n\nThe days and nights have gone dry\n\nThe last three whole years have flashed by"
