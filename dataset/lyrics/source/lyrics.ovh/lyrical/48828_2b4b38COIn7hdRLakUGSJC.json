  "title": "The Rain",
  "lyrics": "The rain the rain\r\nRain came down in sheets that night\r\nAnd you and I stared out to the left and to the right\r\nRain came down in gusts seemed to laugh at us till daylight\r\nThe clouds the clouds\r\nClouds raced out across the autumn sky\n\nAnd you and I fumbled for a way to say goodbye\n\nStrangers weren't we scared to look into each others eyes"
