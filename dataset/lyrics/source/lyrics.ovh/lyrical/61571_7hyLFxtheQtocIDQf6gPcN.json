  "lyrics": "Plain gold ring on his finger he wore\nIt was where everyone could see\nHe belonged to someone, but not me\nOn his hand was a plain gold band\n\nPlain gold ring has a story to tell\n\nIt was one that I knew too well\n\nIn my heart it will never be spring\n\nLong as he wears a plain gold ring\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\nWhen nighttime comes a' callin' on me\n\nI know why I will never be free\n\nI can't stop these teardrops of mine\n\nI'm gonna love him till the end of time\n\nPlain gold ring has but one thing to say\n\nI'll remember till my dying day\n\nIn my heart it will never be spring\n\nLong as he wears a plain gold ring\n\nPlain gold ring on his finger he wore\n\nPlain gold ring on his finger he wore\n\nPlain gold ring on his finger he wore"
