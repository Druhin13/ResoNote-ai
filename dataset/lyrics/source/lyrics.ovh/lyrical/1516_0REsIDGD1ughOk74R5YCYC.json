  "lyrics": "I've ridden down Sunset\r\nI drank expensive wine\r\nI've been married 2 dozen times\r\nRaised ten children on a workman's pay\r\nAnd I'm glad to say I've enjoyed everyday\r\nOf the full catastrophe of life\n\n\n\nI've sat in courtrooms\n\nhad people call me names\n\nI've been to London town\n\nOn a supersonic plane\n\nI was lovin' your wife\n\nWhile you were lovin mine\n\nAnd I'm glad to say I've enjoyed everyday\n\nOf the full catastrophe of life\n\n\n\nI've opened my belt to trouble everyday\n\nAin't looking for a fight\n\nBut you know I won't run away\n\nFrom the full catastrophe of life\n\n\n\nI've seen the goodness\n\nI've known the baddest around\n\nI was tattooed when it first came out\n\nI shook the hand that showed Moses the way\n\nAnd I'm glad to say I've enjoyed everyday\n\nOf the full catastrophe of life"
