  "lyrics": "Wild Bill was born in Illinois on dry and fertile land\r\nPioneer of pistol ears and a dead shot with each hand\r\nClaim he was the quickest, there's few who'd ill-agree\r\nIf you were yet to saw this plainsman draw, still breathe like you and me\r\nHe led a stagecoach freight team in his early days of life\n\nOne evenin' on the Western Trail, Bill took the air of night\n\nAnd who should come upon him, but a bear whom he'd awoke\n\nWild Bill produced his bowie knife and fashioned a new coat\n\n\n\nKansas prairies he knew well and wild Missouri too\n\nCome 1861, Bill donned the Union blue\n\nNot unlike his daddy, he'd seen old man in bonds\n\nEvery man in Jimmy Lane's brigade, of Hickok they were fond\n\n\n\nWhile a marshal in Abilene many Texans came to call\n\nPhil Coe told John Wes Hardin, \"Wild Bill has got to fall\n\n\"He's a cruel and brutish yankee, and if you don't then I will\"\n\nWild Bill put down Phil Coe, Wes Hardin's livin' still\n\n\n\nHe met his fate in Deadwood inside Tom Nuttall's place\n\nAmidst a game of poker, holdin' Aces and two Eights\n\nWhen up stepped from behind him the Coward, Jack McCall\n\nThe slug ripped through his auburn hair, poor Wild Bill never saw"
