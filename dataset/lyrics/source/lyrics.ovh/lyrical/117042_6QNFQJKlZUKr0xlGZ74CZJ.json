I can't hear\n\nBut I still hear the fallen ones in my ears\n\nWhy, why do we live to die, die?\n\nWhen it's my time, time, time\n\nI'll leave behind my end, my 13 Reasons Why\n\n\n\nSay they wanna read my mind\n\nThey really wanna read my mind\n\nTelling you right now, all you'll find\n\nIs a lost soul, rich and blind\n\nThey say they wanna read my mind\n\nDo you really wanna read my mind?\n\nI promise, all that you will find\n\nIs a lost soul, rich and blind\n\n\n\nIs a lost soul, rich and blind\n\nBlind, blind, blind\n\n\n\nDaytrip took it to ten"
