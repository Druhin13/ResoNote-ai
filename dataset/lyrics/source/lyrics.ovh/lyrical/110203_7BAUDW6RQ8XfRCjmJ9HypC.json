  "lyrics": "She's a castaway\r\nStranded on the island of her yesterdays\r\nFreedom was her ocean, but she got swept away\r\nLittle princess dreaming got lost somewhere in the waves\r\nLeft behind\n\nShe's been going at this all alone since she was nine\n\nBut God loves you, He's got a plan for you, she's heard all the lines\n\nBut when she opens up her heart nobody's got the time\n\n\n\nCould this be the day that you come to the rescue?\n\nShe's desperate for the light but she's never gonna ask you\n\n\n\nOne word, one hand\n\nTell me is that too high a price\n\nOne awkward moment\n\nCould be the one that saves a life\n\nYour hurt, your scars\n\nGod will use to open up her eyes\n\nOne awkward moment\n\nYou'll see the gospel come alive\n\nCome alive\n\n\n\nWho are you to say\n\nYou've got shipwrecks of your own\n\nYou're too young in your faith\n\nShe's a smart one, she will see right through your masquerade\n\nYou're scared that what you don't know might push her away\n\n\n\nBut don't cave to the weight of the fear that you're feeling\n\n'Cause she's standing right here and you're here for a reason\n\n\n\nOne word, one hand\n\nTell me is that too high a price\n\nOne awkward moment\n\nCould be the one that saves a life\n\nYour hurt, your scars\n\nGod will use to open up her eyes\n\nOne awkward moment\n\nYou'll see the gospel come alive\n\nCome alive\n\n\n\nYou've walked in her shoes\n\nYou've heard the lies, you know the pain\n\nBut He's still the truth, He's still the life, He's still the way\n\n\n\nOne word, one hand\n\nTell me is that too high a price\n\nOne awkward moment\n\nCould be the one that saves a life\n\nYour hurt, your scars\n\nGod will use to open up her eyes\n\nOne awkward moment\n\nYou'll see the gospel come alive\n\n\n\nYou've walked in her shoes\n\nYou've heard the lies, you know the pain\n\nCome alive\n\nBut He's still the truth, He's still the life, He's still the way\n\nCome alive\n\nYou've walked in her shoes\n\nYou've heard the lies, you know the pain\n\nCome alive\n\nBut He's still the truth, He's still the life, He's still the way\n\nCould this be the day that you come to the rescue?"
