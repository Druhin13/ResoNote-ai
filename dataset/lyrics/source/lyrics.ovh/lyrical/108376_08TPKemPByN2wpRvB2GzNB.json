Where can you be baby?\n\nWhere can you be?\n\n\n\nThere was three sugar walls and a two candy cane windows\n\nBut the serious mood melted ah all those insight\n\nEverybody's on fire but I'm uh snowin' in a cold blizzard.\n\n\n\nWhere are you on this ah hot cold summer?\n\nWhere are you on this ah hot cold summer?\n\nWhere are you on this ah hot cold summer night?\n\n\n\nAround about this time the telephone blew its horn across the room\n\nScared little Annie clean out of her mind and I tell ya\n\nRoman the Candle he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek\n\nAnd grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time\n\nAnd the telephone keeps on screamin'.\n\nYeah yeah yeah!\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah!\n\n\n\nHello said my shaked voice, well how you doin' I start to stutter look\n\nah can't cha tell I'm ah doin'\n\nfine There was my baby talkin' she's way down 'cross the border.\n\n\n\nShe says I'm gonna hurry to ya I've been a fool\n\nAnd I'm tired of cryin'\n\nSaid I'm tired Jimi.\n\n\n\nYes a long long long hot summer night\n\nAs far as my eyes could see\n\nBut I can ah feel the heat comin' on as my baby's gettin' closer.\n\n\n\nI'm so glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me\n\nSo glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me\n\nSo glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me\n\nRescue, rescue me, rescue\n\nRescue me, rescue\n\nRescue, rescue, What'd I say\n\nRescue me, rescue me\n\nRescue, rescue me, rescue\n\nRescue me"
