  "lyrics": "You kiss me like I'm an old habit\r\nMy name's familiar on your lips\r\nIt's not like you've gotta have it\r\nIt's more like you got used to it\r\nI'm not a man in desperation\n\nI'm just a man who can't forget\n\nWhat passion feels like when it's raging\n\nWhat love feels like without a net\n\n\n\nI know I'm your solid ground\n\nI know I'm your settle down\n\nBut I miss those days when I could put\n\nYour head in the clouds\n\nSometimes I wonder if our vow\n\nIs all that's keeping you here now\n\nAm I an anchor or just a rock\n\nYou gotta drag around\n\nOh, drag around\n\n\n\nWe know eachother's every weakness\n\nSometimes our love's like a battlefield\n\nI bite my tongue to hide the honest\n\nYou use your tears like a sword and shield\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder if you ever miss it\n\nOr if you wish for someone else\n\nI don't wanna think about it ending\n\nBut I don't wanna stay here by myself\n\n\n\nWell I know I'm your solid ground\n\nI know I'm your settle down\n\nOh, but I miss those days when I could put\n\nYour head in the clouds\n\nSometimes I wonder if our vow\n\nIs all that's keeping you here now\n\nAm I an anchor or just a rock\n\nYou gotta drag around\n\nOh, drag around\n\n\n\nWell I know I'm your solid ground\n\nI know I'm your settle down\n\nOh, but I miss those days when I could put\n\nYour head in the clouds\n\nSometimes I wonder if our vow\n\nIs all that's keeping you here now\n\nAm I an anchor or just a rock\n\nYou gotta drag around\n\nOh, drag around\n\nDrag around\n\n\n\nYou kiss me like I'm an old habit"
