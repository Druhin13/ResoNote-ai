more grindin' the punishment\n\nCame from the struggles so trust it I know a punishment\n\nSomebody asked me if REASON still spittin' shit\n\nJanikowski still kickin', that hustle still crippin\n\nSprained ankle still limpin' perm web still dippin'\n\nFuck you thought nigga\n\nGod with me I hustle straight off the cross with it\n\nTo the crib is big enough to be lost in it\n\nGo through a lot for lot as long as a cars in it\n\nDefrauds in it we make it by bein' all up in it\n\nSwag like chicken nuggets I got the sauce with it\n\nLyrics potent you know it so when I corner you\n\nYou gotta go deep for you to catch it like Randy Moss did it\n\nRick Ross the whip you know the boss in a Benz for a summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the summer up)\n\n\n\nI'm tryin' to get that new Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the summer up)\n\nTryin' to get that new Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the summer up)\n\nI've been tryin' to get that new Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the summer up)\n\nTryin' to get a new Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the summer up)\n\n\n\nTime runnin' out quick I'm workin' nigga\n\nIt's like I got the clock right on me\n\nHopin' God never hit the stop watch on me\n\nI got a lot move livin', a lot more givin'\n\nA lot more sinin', a lot more learnin'\n\nA lot less finished I've been through a lot\n\nI took a lot but I get a lot because I put a lot more in it\n\nI'm never thinkin' like yo I got a lot more minutes\n\n'Cause when Kendal died I learned the clock keep tickin'\n\nLike damn, wish I could get him back\n\nHe suspended for me before I would forget his rap\n\nNow I'm here with finish I'm in the zone with it\n\nLook on his face let's me know it's hittin' home with him\n\nI done kinda, I kinda got in the groove of it\n\nSlidin' through the streets like the niggas in Cool Runnings\n\nI see a shot, word to JR you know that I'm gon' take it\n\nKeep shootin' 'til I know that I'm gon' make it fuck the stats nigga\n\nYou gotta put up attempts, pop said this\n\nHe gave me the hustle, nigga shut up and sprint\n\n'Til you're runnin' through\n\nThe game bring out the worst in you like summers do\n\nSummers bringin' out murders still in their sun dresses\n\nFor them dresses make a faithful nigga break necks\n\nI'm tryin' take steps so I can be the greatest\n\nHip hop Don shit, I'm tryin' keep it alive like incubators\n\nSee I'm waitin' so know it's the realest REASON made it\n\nThese niggas ain't gonna give me a lane I penetrate it\n\nFuck patience for opportunity I'm finished waitin'\n\nSo know I put my heart in every statement\n\nP asked me if REASON still workin' shit\n\nNigga is Amber Rose still twerkin', gold diggers still flirtin'\n\nHorny teens still jerkin', all my ex's still lurkin'\n\nBlack lives still hurtin', black lives still hurtin'\n\n\n\nNigga Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz

fences\n\nNigga listen nigga Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the summer up)\n\n\n\nI've been tryin' to get that new Benz for the summer up (Benz for the summer up Benz for the
