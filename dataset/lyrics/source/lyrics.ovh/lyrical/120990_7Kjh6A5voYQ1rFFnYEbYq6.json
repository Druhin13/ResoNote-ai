  "lyrics": "If you leave me\r\nLeave me guessing darling\r\nThen I guess you're not for me\r\nWhen you're talking\r\nTalking with an old friend\r\nAnd you decide you must be free\n\n\n\nTell me why, why woman\n\nCan we leave a good thing be?\n\nTell me why, why woman\n\nDid you give up so easily?\n\n\n\nWhen you're looking\n\nLooking for some heat now\n\nAnd I'm as cold as cold can be\n\nAnd you're talking\n\nTalking about a change now\n\nBut those changes aren't with me\n\n\n\nTell me why, why woman\n\nCan we just leave a good thing be?\n\nTell me why, why woman\n\nCan we just be happy?\n\n\n\nBetter leave it alone\n\nLet it work out by itself\n\nMy friends keep telling me, no\n\nWhy she's not with nobody else\n\nOh but I don't know\n\n\n\nTell me why, why woman\n\nCan we just leave a good thing be?\n\nTell me why, why woman\n\nJust stick around and work it out with me"
