  "lyrics": "Silent tears \nIn a sea of sorrow\r\nIf only God would talk to me\r\nAnd promise me tomorrow\r\nDrowning in myself as i\n\nAm facing imperfection\n\nBut the pain makes me feel\n\nI am still alive\n\n\n\nIn Ravenlight, you came to me\n\nFrom silence rose, a symphony\n\nof coming winters white\n\n\n\nParalysed, caught in desperation\n\nEndless nights revisiting\n\nInternal conversations\n\n\n\nFinally I made my peace \n\nWith self intoxication\n\nSo i bleed just to know\n\nI am not alone\n\n\n\nIn Ravenlight, you came to me\n\nFrom silence rose, a symphony\n\nof coming winters white\n\n\n\nMay light embrace the darkest hour\n\nLet it shine to orchestrate the shadows of the night\n\n\n\nIn Ravenlight, you came to me\n\nFrom silence rose, a symphony\n\nof coming winters white\n\n\n\nI love the way you sing to me\n\nFrom silence to a soaring symphony\n\nMy rose in winter white."
