  "lyrics": "Mountains ahead of me and valleys behind\r\nThe road may be narrow, but your mercy is wide\r\nSorrow may linger and last for the night but I am never alone\r\nThe joy of the Lord is my strength, my strength\n\nI may be weak, but I will cling to the vine\n\nIâ€™m pressed but not crushed, for You are making new wine\n\nWounds may be opened and weakness revealed, but I will be healed in the fire\n\n\n\nThe joy of the Lord is my strength, my strength\n\n\n\nSorrow may linger and last for the night but I am never alone\n\nWounds may be opened and weakness revealed but I will be healed in the fire\n\n\n\nI have a river of life flowing out of me\n\nI have a river of life flowing out of me"
