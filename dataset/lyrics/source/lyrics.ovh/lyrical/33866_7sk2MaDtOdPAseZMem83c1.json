  "lyrics": "(Graham Russell)\r\nWhen love is new\r\nAnd the world is out reaching for you\r\nWe try hard to hold it all\r\nIn our hands\n\nBut it slips through\n\nLike soft drifting sands\n\nBut drying the tears\n\nCan build it all like new\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nNow and forever\n\nRemember the words\n\nFrom my heart will always be true\n\nNow and forever\n\nTogether and all that I feel\n\nHere's my love for you\n\n\n\nLearning each day\n\nThat the right time was so far away\n\nTo tell you the things I knew\n\nNow it's clear\n\nThat the moment\n\nWe searched for is here\n\nAnd counting the years\n\nIs all I want to do\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nHold me as close\n\nAs love will allow\n\nUntil all your fears are gone\n\nWhat has all passed\n\nIs over now\n\nI'm here with you\n\nI'm here with you\n\nI'm holding on\n\nI'm holding on\n\nIs my love for you\n\n\n\n[Chorus]"
