  "lyrics": "Call me when you get to Austin\r\nWhen you're fillin' up at that Chevron station\r\nGet yourself a coffee and power through\r\nIt's a long, long road back to you\r\nDays pass and turn into the night\n\nThose farms and fields fade into town lights\n\nDip in your savings, rent yourself a room\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\n\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\n\n\nFront porch luna [?]\n\nMoon swingin' low, can you see it too?\n\nClouds rollin' to now block the view\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\n\n\nTen short, have a ticket down to Denver\n\nBorrowed cash and bank-leaned letters\n\nWaiting for this check to come through\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\n\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\n\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\n\n\n(Long road back to you)\n\n(Long road back to you)\n\n\n\nBack to you\n\nBack to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you\n\nIt's a long, long road back to you"
