  "lyrics": "No, there is no one else like you\r\nIn spite of all the things I do\r\nTo the most high, I salute\r\nCause there is no one else\r\nI've traveled the world, seen a lot of things\r\nSeen a lot of sunshine\n\nBeen through a lot of pain, Lord (so much pain)\n\nI tried to depend on my friends\n\nTo help me make it through\n\nBut at the end of the day, Lord\n\nI found out there is no one else like you\n\nThere is no one else like you\n\nDespite of all the things I do\n\nTo the most high, I salute\n\nCause there is no one else like you\n\nNo matter what the case is\n\nThe mountains that I'm facing (but I still found out)\n\nYour love it never changes, I know\n\nThere is no one else like you"
