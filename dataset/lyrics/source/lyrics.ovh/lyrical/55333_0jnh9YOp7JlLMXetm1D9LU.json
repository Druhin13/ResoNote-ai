  "lyrics": "You've got it all, you've made a difference.\r\nYour decisions fall away from fixing\r\nYour past mistakes\r\nAnd now you wonder why.\r\nBoy let it play, so sick and twisted.\n\nBoy a lot to say, I know you're pissed\n\n'Cause there's a lot at stake\n\n'Least you can say you tried\n\n\n\n'Cause you've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nWell I've got secrets of my own.\n\n\n\nBabe, you've gotten so good at letting us down.\n\nYou say it's not your fault but everybody,\n\nEverybody else around.\n\nAround, around\n\n\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nWell I've got secrets of my own.\n\n\n\nThese decisions that you make\n\nOn everyone is fake.\n\nTime is running out on you and you know.\n\nSo how are you gonna play\n\nThis thing? Every day,\n\nHow you gonna look yourself in the eye?\n\n\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nWell I've got secrets of my own.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nYou've got secrets.\n\nWell I've got secrets of my own."
