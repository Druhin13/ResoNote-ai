  "lyrics": "Mr. Toronto man, go away from my door\r\nYou've got my wheat and canola seed, you're askin' me for more\r\nBetter fly 'fore I produce my .44\r\nI'm just a prairie boy, never meant none no harm\r\nSpent my days makin' wages out on the Martin's farm\n\nNo eastern boys are gonna twist my arm\n\n\n\nIt's so damn cold out here, the wind'll cut you half in two\n\nI ain't kiddin' now, my old plow is frozen to my mule\n\nI've been livin' off of ice-cold rainbow stew\n\n\n\nDon't be pickin' fights with no Mennonites\n\nDon't be raisin' cane while they're plantin' grain and workin' through the night\n\nThey're gonna let you know if you ain't actin' right\n\n\n\nMr. Toronto man, go away from my door\n\nYou've got my wheat and canola seed, you're askin' me for more\n\nBetter fly 'fore I produce my .44\n\nBetter fly 'fore I produce my .44"
