  "lyrics": "How could we know\r\nThat there wouldn't be tomorrow\r\nNo birds will sing\r\nBut the bells will ring for you\r\nSo far to go\r\nBut you've already reached the light\n\nYour new beginning\n\nChapters are written out for you\n\nDown here they're hurting\n\nFrom a broken heart\n\nTrying to figure out\n\nHow this is real\n\n\n\n'Cause you're never coming back down\n\nYou belong to the stars in the clouds\n\nGoodbyes, good times\n\nAnd all we hear is all for you\n\nIf you didn't say your goodbyes\n\nDon't worry love will bear it through\n\n'Cause you're never coming back down\n\nYou belong to the stars in the clouds\n\n\n\nHow do we go\n\nIf you're not moving with us\n\nConstantly dark\n\nTime will move in our favor\n\nThey'll never know\n\nBut they just keep on asking when\n\nWe're down here hurting\n\nFrom our broken heart\n\nTrying to figure out\n\nHow this is real\n\n\n\n'Cause they're never coming back down\n\nThey belong to the stars in the clouds\n\nGoodbyes, good times\n\nAnd all we hear is all for you\n\nIf you didn't say your goodbyes\n\nDon't worry love will bear it through\n\n\n\nI'm sorry that I never replied\n\nHow was I to know this would be our last Goodbye\n\nWe can't look at the world with tears in our eyes\n\nDon't cry don't cry, don't cry don't cry\n\n\n\nJust think of all the good times you've left behind\n\nAnd all we hear is all for you\n\nIf you didn't say your goodbyes\n\nDon't worry love will bear it through\n\n'Cause you're never coming back down\n\nYou belong to the stars in the clouds"
