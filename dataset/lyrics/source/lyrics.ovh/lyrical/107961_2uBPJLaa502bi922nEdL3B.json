  "lyrics": "Oh, I've been thinking that I don't wanna leave\r\nThat this house isn't home to me\r\nI'm tired of losing everyone I see\r\nNow that you're here, it's a hard thing to do\r\nTrying to hold on\n\nOh, but I need you\n\nFar more than I ever want you\n\nIt's such an unnatural thing we do\n\nWhen falling in love's just so hard to do\n\nHard to do\n\nBut I need you\n\nFar more than I ever want you\n\nIt's such an unnatural thing we do\n\nWhen falling in love's just so hard to do\n\nHard to do\n\n\n\nMaybe I don't believe that I don't wanna run\n\nBut two hearts are better than one\n\nYou say you'll stick around but I'll be gone\n\nOh, I'll be gone\n\nIt's a hard thing to do, trying to hold on\n\n\n\nBut I need you\n\nFar more than I ever want you\n\nIt's such an unnatural thing we do\n\nWhen falling in love's just so hard to do\n\nHard to do\n\nBut I need you\n\nFar more than I ever want you\n\nIt's such an unnatural thing we do\n\nWhen falling in love's just so hard to do\n\nHard to do\n\n\n\nAnd while you've been pushing, I'm pulling away\n\nI wish I can say all the words I don't say\n\nBut I should stop 'cause we're miles away, we're miles away\n\n\n\nBut I need you\n\nFar more than I ever want you\n\nIt's such an unnatural thing we do\n\nWhen falling in love's just so hard to do\n\nHard to do"
