  "lyrics": "There, there she lays\r\nHead on a pillow\r\nShe's got her eyes closed\r\nFrom her days\r\nAnd here, here I sit\r\nAlone in coldness\n\nFrom words that I said\n\nThat ain't ever coming back\n\n\n\nOh she lays like broken glass\n\nShattered, broken glass\n\n\n\nWhile, while she dreams\n\nI will be searching\n\nSo much rehearsing\n\nApologies\n\nWill I, will I try hard\n\nTo be so perfect\n\nShe is so perfect\n\nOh but she is a fragile, fragile thing\n\n\n\nAnd she lays like broken glass\n\nShattered, broken glass\n\n\n\nIt seems I forget\n\nWhat kind of woman\n\nShe's never showing\n\nYeah but she is a fragile, fragile thing\n\n\n\nOh she lays like broken glass\n\nShattered, broken glass\n\nYeah she lays like broken glass\n\nShattered, broken glass"
