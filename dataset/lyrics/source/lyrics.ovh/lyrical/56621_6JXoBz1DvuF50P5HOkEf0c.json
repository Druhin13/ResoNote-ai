  "lyrics": "We're slipping away\r\nInto deep graves\r\nThis world decaying\r\nOur flesh betraying\r\nIt's purpose to hold\r\nOur mortal mold\n\nWe rip the air from our lungs\n\nAt the end of our guns\n\nPush others over\n\nTo get what we desire\n\nForgetting how we were wired\n\nTo live for more than to build our empires\n\n\n\nAnd behold the world you burn\n\nIt will take your life in turn\n\nRedirect what you have built\n\nOr there will be nothing left\n\n\n\nTo live in objection\n\nOf perfection\n\nExisting provisionally\n\nRenouncing immortality\n\nForgetting how fragile\n\nYour life can be\n\nYou cling to misdirect\n\nThat you are a king\n\nOf the transition\n\nBut will never see\n\nPerfection\n\nThere's life after death\n\nAnd misdirection\n\n\n\nWhat will you carry to the ground\n\nWhat will you bury to save yourself now\n\n\n\nWhen will you turn?"
