  "lyrics": "Flow away away away\r\nIt always starts the same\r\nA game of chess you want to play\r\nSeems to get harder every day\r\nThe pain just never strays\r\nForget if for a day\n\nIt's just a part of all the ways\n\nIt always builds up in the brain to throw away\n\nThrow it away\n\n\n\nIt never goes away\n\nKeep praying for the day\n\nIt always lifted from your brain\n\nAnd just returns to empty space\n\nYou throw away\n\n\n\n[?]\n\nIt's all [?] since the burning[?] defection\n\nGo back, go back, go back [?]\n\n\n\nIt really doesn't matter what they do\n\nIt doesn't get sad [?] you"
