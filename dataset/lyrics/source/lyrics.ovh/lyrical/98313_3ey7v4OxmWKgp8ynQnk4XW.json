How can you be so naive?\n\nPeople killing others 'cause of their beliefs (Wow, wow)\n\n\n\nWe tried coming down, but we saw no light (Saw no light)\n\nWe like species who represent good vibes (That's what we like)\n\nWe fly over Earth and we say goodbye (Doei, doei)\n\nIn time, we hope you recognize what's right\n\nWaiting, patient, til' the time is right for us to save it\n\nBefore you fade away\n\n\n\nMaybe one day we'll come say hi\n\nBut right now is not the right time\n\nWe'll be on our spaceship, flying different places\n\nWaiting for the day when you're done with all that fake shit\n\nSo many times we tried to help\n\nTried to save you from yourselves\n\nWe'll be on our spaceship flying different places\n\nHoping for the day when you overcome your hatred (Fuck, yeah)\n\n\n\nWe came to your planet, but we had to leave\n\nSaw too many things we didn't wanna see\n\nWhen you're all together, you look at your screens\n\nWhat’s your problem? How can you be so naive?\n\nPeople killing others 'cause of their beliefs (How?)\n\n\n\nWe see people fighting, ayy\n\nWe see rockets flying, ayy\n\nWe see babies crying, ayy\n\nPoliticians lying, woah\n\nWhere is the unity? You're so divided, woah\n\nWhere is the love? We can't seem to find it\n\n\n\nWe tried to help, tried to save you from yourselves\n\nWe tried to help, tried to save you from yourselves\n\n\n\nSwitch\n\nMaybe one day, we'll come say hi\n\nBut right now is not the right time\n\nWe'll be on our spaceship, flying different places\n\nWaiting for the day when you're done with all that fake shit"
