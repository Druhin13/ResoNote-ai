  "lyrics": "Our love is lying on the floor\r\nFar away from what it was before\r\nAnd I hope it will condition\r\nStanding on the edge [?] without a mission\r\nKeep me singing as I just shut the door\r\nI don't need you in my life no more\n\nI'll go look for something different\n\nSomething that I long for, something that I'm missing\n\n\n\nWhen bombs are falling all around me\n\nI leave you on the floor\n\nI close the door so you can't see\n\nWhat I do in times of war (what I do, wha-wha-what I do)\n\nWhat I do in times of war (what I do, wha-wha-what I do)\n\nWhat I do when I don't need you anymore\n\n\n\nWhat we had and what we used to be\n\nI threw away so easily\n\n'Cause you ruined our relation\n\nAnd fucking all my friends when you wanted my attention\n\nAnd I want to forget you like you never existed\n\nNever existed, no\n\nBut this house reminds me of our love\n\nMaybe I should light it up\n\n\n\nWhen bombs are falling all around me\n\nI leave you on the floor\n\nI close the door so you can't see\n\nWhat I do in times of war (what I do, wha-wha-what I do)\n\nWhat I do in times of war (what I do, wha-wha-what I do)\n\nWhat I do when I don't need you anymore\n\n\n\nI hope you're all alone now\n\nDancing on your own now\n\nI hope you're all alone now, yeah\n\nNo, no, no\n\n\n\nWhen bombs are falling all around me\n\nAnd I leave you on the floor\n\nI close the door so you can't see\n\nWhat I do in times of war (what I do, wha-wha-what I do)\n\nWhat I do in times of war (what I do, wha-wha-what I do)\n\nWhat I do when I don't need you anymore\n\n\n\nI hope you're all alone now"
