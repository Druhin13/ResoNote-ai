  "lyrics": "Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',\nI was layin' in bed\nWond'rin' if she'd changed at all\nIf her hair was still red.\nHer folks they said our lives together\nSure was gonna be rough\n\nThey never did like Mama's homemade dress\n\nPapa's bankbook wasn't big enough.\n\nAnd I was standin' on the side of the road\n\nRain fallin' on my shoes\n\nHeading out for the East Coast\n\nLord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,\n\nTangled up in blue.\n\n\n\nShe was married when we first met\n\nSoon to be divorced\n\nI helped her out of a jam, I guess,\n\nBut I used a little too much force.\n\nWe drove that car as far as we could\n\nAbandoned it out West\n\nSplit up on a dark sad night\n\nBoth agreeing it was best.\n\nShe turned around to look at me\n\nAs I was walkin' away\n\nI heard her say over my shoulder,\n\n\"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,\"\n\nTangled up in blue.\n\n\n\nI had a job in the great north woods\n\nWorking as a cook for a spell\n\nBut I never did like it all that much\n\nAnd one day the ax just fell.\n\nSo I drifted down to New Orleans\n\nWhere I happened to be employed\n\nWorkin' for a while on a fishin' boat\n\nRight outside of Delacroix.\n\nBut all the while I was alone\n\nThe past was close behind,\n\nI seen a lot of women\n\nBut she never escaped my mind, and I just grew\n\nTangled up in blue.\n\n\n\nShe was workin' in a topless place\n\nAnd I stopped in for a beer,\n\nI just kept lookin' at the side of her face\n\nIn the spotlight so clear.\n\nAnd later on as the crowd thinned out\n\nI's just about to do the same,\n\nShe was standing there in back of my chair\n\nSaid to me, \"Don't I know your name?\"\n\nI muttered somethin' underneath my breath,\n\nShe studied the lines on my face.\n\nI must admit I felt a little uneasy\n\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,\n\nTangled up in blue.\n\n\n\nShe lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe\n\n\"I thought you'd never say hello,\" she said\n\n\"You look like the silent type.\"\n\nThen she opened up a book of poems\n\nAnd handed it to me\n\nWritten by an Italian poet\n\nFrom the thirteenth century.\n\nAnd every one of them words rang true\n\nAnd glowed like burnin' coal\n\nPourin' off of every page\n\nLike it was written in my soul from me to you,\n\nTangled up in blue.\n\n\n\nI lived with them on Montague Street\n\nIn a basement down the stairs,\n\nThere was music in the cafes at night\n\nAnd revolution in the air.\n\nThen he started into dealing with slaves\n\nAnd something inside of him died.\n\nShe had to sell everything she owned\n\nAnd froze up inside.\n\nAnd when finally the bottom fell out\n\nI became withdrawn,\n\nThe only thing I knew how to do\n\nWas to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,\n\nTangled up in blue.\n\n\n\nSo now I'm goin' back again,\n\nI got to get to her somehow.\n\nAll the people we used to know\n\nThey're an illusion to me now.\n\nSome are mathematicians\n\nSome are carpenter's wives.\n\nDon't know how it all got started,\n\nI don't know what they're doin' with their lives.\n\nBut me, I'm still on the road\n\nHeadin' for another joint\n\nWe always did feel the same,\n\nWe just saw it from a different point of view,\n\nTangled up in blue."
