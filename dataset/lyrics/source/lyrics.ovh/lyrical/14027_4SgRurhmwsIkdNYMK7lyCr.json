  "lyrics": "Gonna feel the sound\r\nGonna hear the way the light hits the ground\r\nGonna know what it feels like to drown\r\nMy lungs fill up and make like the liquid of a cloud\r\nGonna comb back my hair\r\nGonna feel the softest of water when it hits the night air\n\nGonna burn your body to the ground\n\nAlong with all my memories of you\n\nBefore they fade out\n\n\n\nGonna climb inside love and\n\nBurrow deep into the cavern, the weight settles in\n\nBe on the stowaways\n\nGonna look 'em all in the eye as they spit in my face\n\nI'm going to take you out into view\n\nIm gonna run my eyes up and down until the night sees itself through\n\nI want more than just a kiss\n\nI want to breathe you in until you cease to exist\n\n\n\nTo feel no pain\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no shame\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no pain\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\n\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no pain\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no shame\n\n\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no pain\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no shame\n\n\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo feel no shame\n\nTo die, to die, today\n\nTo die, to die, today"
