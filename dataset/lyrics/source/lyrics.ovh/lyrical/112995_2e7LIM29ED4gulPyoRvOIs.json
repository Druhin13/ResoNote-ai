  "lyrics": "I want to live, I want to give\r\nI've been a miner for a heart of gold\r\nIt's these expressions I never give\r\nThat keep me searchin' for a heart of gold\r\nAnd I'm getting old\r\nKeep me searchin' for a heart of gold\n\nAnd I'm getting old\n\n\n\nI've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood\n\nI crossed the ocean for a heart of gold\n\nI've been in my mind, it's such a fine line\n\nThat keeps me searchin' for a heart of gold\n\nAnd I'm getting old\n\nKeeps me searchin' for a heart of gold\n\nAnd I'm getting old\n\n\n\nKeep me searchin' for a heart of gold\n\nYou keep me searchin' and I'm growing old\n\nKeep me searchin' for a heart of gold\n\nI've been a miner for a heart of gold"
