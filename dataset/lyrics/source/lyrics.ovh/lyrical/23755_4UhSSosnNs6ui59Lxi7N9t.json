  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson In or Out par Story Untold\r\nFirst time heard your voice\nCrystal clear through the noise\nInstantly connected\nAnd all those summer nights I couldn't sleep\nYou stayed up lying next to me\nYou said you'd never ever leave\nYou said you'd never ever leave\n\nYou say that nothing's changed\nIt doesn't feel the same\n\nSo are you in or out\nCause I don't know what you're thinking 'bout\nWhen you ask me to stay\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nAnd if you want someone else\n\nMaybe you just fool yourself\nWhen you try to explain\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nI know what I said before, I don't care anymore\n\nFirst time we ran away\nHolding hands, we escaped\nSo deeply connected\nWe'd wish on shooting stars across the sky\nYou held your breath, I held you tight\nI said I'd never ever leave\nI said I'd never ever leave\n\nYou say that nothing's changed\nIt doesn't feel the same\n\nSo are you in or out\nCause I don't know what you're thinking 'bout\n\nWhen you ask me to stay\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nAnd if you want someone else\nMaybe you just fool yourself\nWhen you try to explain\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nI know what I said before, I don't care anymore\n\nIt sucks to know what we had was real\nAnd now when we kiss I know that you're gone\nAnd I know that these wounds will never heal\nSo you can go on and try but I don't care anymore\nSo you can go on and try but I don't care anymore\n\nYou say that nothing's changed\nIt doesn't feel the same\n\nSo are you in or out\n\nCause I don't know what you're thinking 'bout\nWhen you ask me to stay\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nAnd if you want someone else\nMaybe you just fool yourself\nWhen you try to explain\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nYou tell me you love me but I don't believe it\nI know what I said before, I don't care anymore"
