  "lyrics": "Don't you know this night isn't over\r\nCause I've still got this music running round in my head\r\nWe could lose it all in this moment\r\nThen do it all again and again and again\r\nLazy eyes, I don't wanna sound\r\nCrazy high, but I'm having this\n\nAmazing time, out here with you\n\n\n\nIt's been a good night\n\nWe don't need a DJ to party\n\nNo one's saying goodbye\n\nWe're riding, we're riding the wave\n\nYes it's been a good night\n\nAnd this party's just getting started\n\nNo one's saying goodbye\n\nKeep riding, keep riding the wave\n\n\n\nMoving to the thumping rhythm\n\nOf our beating hearts\n\nNothing but our troubles missing\n\nWe're glowing in the dark.\n\nLazy eyes, I don't wanna sound\n\nCrazy high, but I'm having this\n\nAmazing time, out here with you\n\n\n\nLet the waves crash down\n\nPull us under now\n\nLost inside the sound\n\nLet's rise, rise, rise"
