(Tell me, why, though?)\n\nIs it cause I got them racks on me?\n\nChanel's on the drip, double C\n\nJewelry cold as the ice in my lean (Yeah, yeah)\n\nI was in the field, like Madden (Madden)\n\nHopped off the porch, and I ain't know what happened (What happened)\n\nI can feel this codeine in my abdomen\n\nNow I got more money than I was fathomin'\n\nI was rich, went broke, and got a bag again\n\nI just wanna make sure I got enough saved for the kids\n\nI just wanna make sure my habits ain't affectin' the way I live\n\nI came up out the streets, nigga I can't lie that's how I live\n\n\n\nNigga I can't lie, shit changed\n\nWhen I start countin' the faces\n\nSoon as I bust my face down\n\nAll these niggas wanna hate me now\n\nGot bleu cheese in the safe now\n\nDiamonds outline my name now\n\nI done seen the worst outcomes\n\nWhy a nigga ride around with my drum (Yeah, yeah)"
