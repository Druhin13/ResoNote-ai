  "lyrics": "Shadowed truth never tries to hide\r\nAn inconvenient pride\r\nBuilds abundant supplies\r\nAs the Puritan dies\r\nThe attrition machine\r\nBuilds a new guillotine\n\nAnd in the place of its birth\n\nBreeds a new Nazarene\n\n\n\nGrind down the iron gears\n\nPlunge the pike, work, work\n\n\n\nWith extinct human skills\n\nNevermore can you choose\n\nNow oppressor resistor\n\nYou've got nothing to lose\n\nWith a noble existence\n\nForged through heart and through hand\n\nThis machine has burned down\n\nThe ever providing man\n\n\n\nGrind down the iron gears\n\nPlunge the pike, work, work\n\n\n\nA distant wind breeds fire\n\nBurning tall\n\nPreaching to the choir\n\nThe lost retain control\n\nOh, burn 'em down\n\n\n\nNow hungry for oblivion\n\nWhat have the powerful become\n\nPiles of flesh, greed and sin\n\nDevoured by the teeth of angry laymen\n\nPlunging the knife\n\nIn this black industry\n\nA humbled rebirth\n\nThe green Earth now remains free\n\n\n\nGrind down the iron gears\n\nPlunge the pike, work, work\n\n\n\nGrind down the iron gears\n\nPlunge the pike, work, work\n\n\n\nA distant wind breeds fire\n\nBurning tall\n\nPreaching to the choir\n\nThe lost retain control\n\n\n\nCollective reason by riot\n\nThe oppressor cannot deny it\n\nTechnology burns\n\nWhen the Luddite returns"
