  "lyrics": "Wasn't I enough?\r\nDidn't I amount to you?\r\nI don't blame you for the love\r\nThat I lost to you\r\nIt will take time\r\nA lot of heartache too\n\nBut I was in love\n\nI thought you were too\n\n\n\nNo one compares, if I'm honest\n\nI've beaten myself blue\n\nI wish you could've been honest\n\nInstead of trying to look cool\n\n\n\nDid I breathe? Did I?\n\nDid I sleep?\n\nDid I eat?\n\nDid I cheat? Did I?\n\nDid I do something wrong?\n\nDid I hit the peak? Did I?\n\nDid I feel?\n\nDid I steal?\n\nNo, I didn't do anything but love\n\n\n\nNow we get along\n\nThat's just what we have to do\n\nBut I know every song\n\nSang out my heart for you\n\nI've gotta stay humble\n\nAnd you have to too\n\nIt was the hope, he crumbles\n\nWhere it once stood tall\n\n\n\nNo one compares, if I'm honest\n\nI've beaten myself blue\n\nI wish you could've been honest\n\nInstead of trying to look cool\n\n\n\nDid I breathe? Did I?\n\nDid I sleep?\n\nDid I eat?\n\nDid I cheat? Did I?\n\nDid I do something wrong?\n\nDid I hit the peak? Did I?\n\nDid I feel?\n\nDid I steal?\n\nNo, I didn't do anything but love"
