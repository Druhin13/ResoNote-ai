When it's me that applied it\n\nI put skengs in a bruk down Vestra\n\nDem man are Brock like Lesnar\n\nI still get it in a dance, I couldn't give a fuck about wands and sensors\n\nCircle the opp block too many times now the gang just restless\n\nMy phone done a One last night, I just spent it\n\nCos these weapons still part of expenses, I'm still stuck in the trenches\n\nBeen locked in a room with weights and benches, My trap phone still benchpress\n\nSpend it on teeth and we ain't even gotta go dentist\n\n\n\nDrilling, trapping, Olympic chinging\n\nName an opp block I ain't been in\n\nAnything green get bun, hit anyone except kids and women\n\nRambos twinning, on a late night trynna catch man slippin'\n\nGo home with my black blade drippin', dem man run shit I pray that I catch one trippin'\n\nChef man down I'm Michelin starred, tools in the ride like I'm fixing a car\n\nWho's got a problem? No block in Tottenham does more drilling than ours\n\nI can get man down with the team, or I can ride alone\n\nLeave my house and my keys, rambo tucked and a Lyca phone\n\nJakes done a raid at my mum's house, I can tell that she ain't impressed\n\nI swear down I really hate these feds\n\nMust think I'm dumb, to have this gun and stay at the same address\n\nThey couldn't rate me less\n\nDC [?] tried read my rights, told him not to waste his breath\n\nRe'd up on a g-pack, all of these cells that I hit to the b-cats\n\nCould have me back in a cell in a b-cat, and I ain't trynna see that\n\nSo I gotta step with caution, sliders or expensive Jordans\n\nRV I'm stuck in the trap, like my girl didn't get an abortion"
