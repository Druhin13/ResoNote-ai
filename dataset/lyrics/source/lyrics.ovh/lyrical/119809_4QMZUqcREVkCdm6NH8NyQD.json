  "lyrics": "Oh, the weather outside is frightful\r\nBut the fire is so delightful\r\nAnd since we've no place to go\r\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\r\nIt doesn't show signs of stopping\n\nAnd I brought some corn for popping\n\nThe lights are turned way down low\n\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\n\n\nWhen we finally kiss good-night\n\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\n\nBut if you really hold me tight\n\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\n\n\nThe fire is slowly dying\n\nAnd, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing\n\nBut as long as you love me so\n\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow\n\n\n\nWhen we finally kiss good-night\n\nHow I'll hate going out in the storm\n\nBut if you really hold me tight\n\nAll the way home I'll be warm\n\n\n\nThe fire is slowly dying\n\nAnd, my dear, we're still good-bye-ing\n\nBut as long as you love me so\n\nLet it snow, let it snow, let it snow"
