  "lyrics": "How do you sleep when you're nothing but a fake\r\nHow do you pretend you're suddenly awake\r\nWhen you're under a deep trance covering your face\r\nCan't run from the demons\r\nFell asleep, you’re in a dream\n\nYou call reality\n\nYou’ve forgotten what is real\n\nI don’t believe that who you see is what you wanna be\n\nYou can’t change the way you feel\n\n\n\nYou're living in the darkness\n\nAfraid to see the light\n\n\n\nWake up\n\nJust open your eyes, your eyes\n\nWake up\n\nYou're living a lie\n\nSo just open, open, open your eyes\n\n\n\nOpen your eyelids to see what you've become\n\nA person that's lying deceiving who you love\n\nYou'll be sitting in silence believing you're the one\n\nBut under the diamond you're a zero in the rough\n\n\n\nTrapped inside this state of mind\n\nHow could you be so blind\n\nYou’re living a lie\n\nThe more you hide behind your lies, the more you realize\n\nThat there is no way to escape\n\n\n\nYou're living in the darkness\n\nAfraid to see the light\n\n\n\nWake up\n\nJust open your eyes, your eyes\n\nWake up\n\nYou're living a lie\n\nSo just open, open, open your eyes...\n\n\n\nAre closed and you’re fooling no one\n\nWith the lies you’ve told are the reason that you can’t open your eyes are closed\n\nAnd you’re fooling no one\n\nWith the lies you’ve told are the reason that you’re blind\n\n\n\nWake up\n\nJust open your eyes, your eyes\n\nWake up\n\nYou're living a lie\n\nSo just open, open, open\n\nSo just open, open, open\n\nWake up\n\nYou're living a lie\n\nOpen, open, open your eyes"
