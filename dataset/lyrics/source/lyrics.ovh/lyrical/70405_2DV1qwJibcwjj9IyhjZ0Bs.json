  "lyrics": "I do my make up in somebody else's car \nWe order different drinks at the same bars \nI know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth \nShe thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar \nThose great whites, they have big teeth\n\nHope they bite you\n\nThought you said that you would always be in love\n\nBut you're not in love no more\n\nDid it frighten you\n\nHow we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?\n\nOn the light up floor\n\n\n\nBut I hear sounds in my mind\n\nBrand new sounds in my mind\n\nBut honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go\n\nBut honey I'll be seein' you down every road\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\n\n\n'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nOh, I wish I could get my things and just let go\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\n\n\nSometimes I wake up in a different bedroom\n\nI whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you\n\n\n\nAll those rumors, they have big teeth\n\nHope they bite you\n\nThought you said that you would always be in love\n\nBut you're not in love no more\n\nDid it frighten you\n\nHow we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?\n\nOn the light up floor\n\n\n\nBut I hear sounds in my mind\n\nBrand new sounds in my mind\n\nBut honey I'll be seein' you 'ever I go\n\nBut honey I'll be seein' you down every road\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\n\n\n'Cause honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nOh, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nYes, honey I'll come get my things, but I can't let go\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nOh, I wish I could get my things and just let go\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\n\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it"
