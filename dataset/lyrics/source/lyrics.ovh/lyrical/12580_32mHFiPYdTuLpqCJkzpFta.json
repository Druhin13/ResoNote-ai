  "lyrics": "In my dream, I see you there\r\nYour eyes fixed in a vacant stare\r\nA little laugh, a crooked smile\r\nDon't lift a finger while I lay dying\r\nBone dry\n\nYou drank all the blood\n\nMy heart is bone dry\n\nCan't give you more 'cause you took all of it\n\n(Sha la la)\n\n\n\nWas a day when I did believe\n\nThe things you say are what you mean\n\nDear sweet, innocent me\n\nHow much you took from me to finally see\n\n\n\nBone dry\n\nYou drank all the blood\n\nMy heart is bone dry\n\nCan't give you more 'cause you took all of it\n\n(Sha la la, sha la la)\n\n\n\nShouby dooby dooby doo\n\nShouby dooby\n\nShouby dooby dooby doo\n\n\n\nWhat becomes a man like me\n\nDrifting off, lost at see\n\nI'll set a fire; look up for it\n\nLookin' for me, I'm a pink sunset\n\n\n\nBone dry (sha la la)\n\nYou drank all the blood\n\nMy heart is bone dry (sha la la)\n\nCan't give you more 'cause you took all of it\n\n(sha la la)\n\n\n\nBone dry, whoo! (sha la la)\n\nBone dry, whoo! (sha la la)\n\nYou took all of it (sha la la)\n\n(Sha la la, sha la la, sha la la)"
