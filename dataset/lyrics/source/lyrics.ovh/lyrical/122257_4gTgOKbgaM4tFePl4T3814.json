  "lyrics": "Sometimes I wake at night\r\nAnd watch the rain fall through the street lights\r\n'Cause you're standing still in my mind\r\nFading out, waving goodbye\r\nAnd I wonder where you are tonight\n\nIf the one you're with was a compromise\n\nAs we're walking lines in parallel\n\nThat will never meet and it's just as well\n\n\n\nSometimes I'm overcome\n\nBy every choice I couldn't outrun\n\nThe junctions all disappear\n\nYou can't double back to your summer years\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder where you are tonight\n\nIf the one you're with was a compromise\n\nAs we're walking lines in parallel\n\nThat will never meet and it's just as well\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder where you are tonight\n\nIf the one you're with was a compromise\n\nAs we're walking lines in parallel\n\nThat will never meet and it's just as well\n\nIt's just as well\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder where you are tonight\n\nIf the one you're with was a compromise\n\nAs we're walking lines in parallel\n\nThat will never meet and it's just as well\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder where you are tonight\n\nIf the one you're with was a compromise\n\nAs we're walking lines in parallel\n\nThat will never meet and it's just as well\n\nIt's just as well"
