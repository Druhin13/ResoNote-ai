Something came in with the night\nSnow came in heavy, my boys and me wandering blind, yeah\nWell, it's temporary darling\nNow that bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan heard all our lines\nMeant what I said, I want all of this all of the time\n\nOh, when I'm gone\nAt the dune with the dawn\nWell, that's all I could want\n\nWe were young, we were free\nCome on now, let it go\n\nWe were young, we were free\nI was living in the cold, I'm coming home\nPerfect line to open with\nHer heart was never meant for this\nOoh, we're never over it\nWe were young, we were free, yeah yeah\n\nAll that she said to me stays with me, never to die\nHeld me brand new in the silence that went through the pines\nLike I said already, darling\nI don't want you looking back at all the ghosts left behind\nKnow you'll stay near me so road remains hopeful this time\n\nWe were young, we were free\n\nCome on now, let it go\nWe were young, we were free\nI was living in the cold, I'm coming home\nPerfect line to open with\nHer heart was never meant for this\nOoh, we're never over it\nWe were young, we were free, yeah yeah\n\nKeepin' another for a night, keepin' another for a night\nAll I'll ever know, baby, we were bound to burn\nKeepin' another for a night, keepin' another for a night\nAll I'll ever know, baby, we were bound to burn\nBaby, we were bound to burn\n\nWe were young, we were free\nCome on now, let it go\n\nWe were young, we were free\nI was living in the cold, I'm coming home\nPerfect line to open with\nHer heart was never meant for this\nOoh, we're never over it\nWe were young, we were free, yeah yeah\n\nOh, when I'm gone\nAt the dune with the dawn\nWell, that's all I could want"
