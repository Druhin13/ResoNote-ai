Alternate false realities\r\nFucking insane Christian Hypocrisy\r\nHe lies!\r\nGodless devils preach\r\nLiberty is to enslave\n\nChain us up, lock us out\n\nIgnore the masses that hold doubt\n\nCoerced, hypnotized\n\nIgnorance is sanctified\n\nBurn the bible and the flag\n\nSacrifice for the ashes for collapse\n\n\n\nDamn Neophyte! Praise your chosen myth!\n\nToxic events incite The Holocaust\n\n\n\nCorrupt little hands\n\nYou rigged the system contraband\n\nThin skinned, small eyes\n\nEvangelically forced to comply\n\nHe lies!\n\nHope is lost!\n\n\n\nPro-Life Triggerman\n\nHope is lost!\n\nIlluminati predestined\n\nHope is lost!\n\nDeath comes to us all\n\nHope is lost!\n\nExecutioner morals\n\nHope is lost!\n\nHow can you make it great?\n\nFuck your intolerance and hate!"
