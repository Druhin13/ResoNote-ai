  "lyrics": "So has my truth been seen tested by time\r\nReckoned by age, trialed by fire\r\nWas there wisdom in what I believed\r\nOr was it ghosts by whom I was deceived\r\nSo what I found on this trial\n\nThe scattered remains of those who have failed\n\nSo the world has taught me many things\n\nOne I pass onto you\n\nThe world that we are looking for\n\nWell, it isn't coming soon\n\n\n\nAnd I climbed one mountain side\n\nTo find yet another\n\nAn endless sea of darkness for us yet to discover\n\nAnd my soul pines for rest\n\nIn the heat of the flame I so desire\n\nIt burns, the heat of the fire"
