  "lyrics": "Dearly beloved\r\nI'm writing this letter in hopes that it reaches you in time\r\nI've lived in darkness for so long that my heart beats no more\r\nAnd the only light I seek is an undying flame across the earth\r\nI watch the horror, it sickens me\n\nYou all know nothing of misery\n\nThe sound of hate, the sound of hate, it's deafening\n\nThis world means nothing to me\n\nI am the bringer of ends\n\nI am the bearer of night\n\nAll of your greed and your gluttony\n\nNow you all must die\n\n\n\nNo one can run\n\nNo one can hide\n\nThis reckoning in my eyes\n\nNowhere to turn\n\nYour fate I decide\n\nThis reckoning in my eyes\n\n\n\nPray, pray\n\nPray for the end of times\n\nPray, pray\n\nPray for the end, the end of times\n\n\n\nFilled with the worms of decay\n\nYour skin shall perish in vain\n\nFilled with the worms of decay\n\nYour skin shall perish in vain\n\n\n\nNo one can run\n\nNo one can hide\n\nThis reckoning in my eyes\n\nNowhere to turn\n\nYour fate I decide\n\nThis reckoning in my eyes\n\n\n\nPray, pray\n\nPray for the end of times\n\nPray, pray\n\nPray for the end, the end of times\n\n\n\nA world cloaked in lies\n\nA world cloaked in lies\n\nWill face its demise\n\nWith illness and agony\n\nWith illness and agony\n\nI'll watch humanity die\n\n\n\nI'll watch humanity die\n\nI'll watch humanity die"
