  "lyrics": "Just a cigarette break, leave the ashes on the fire escape\r\nTo burn away all the words we wanna say\r\nI'm counting down every breath you take\r\nIt's just a cigarette break\r\nLittle fires, little talks and ticking clocks\r\nWill take me higher, but you're the one I'm dreaming of\n\nWhen all these moments pass away\n\nJust a little too late\n\n\n\nOh, but I saw a spark\n\nAnd I've never seen a more beautiful thing\n\nAm I just dreaming?\n\nLet's take it too far\n\n'Cause every word you say colours me in\n\nAnd should we begin before it's too late?\n\nSay that you'll take a cigarette break\n\n\n\nSo innocent, but lies they always hurt the most when\n\nThe truth gets bent, I'm trying hard to make some sense\n\nWith all the words that you said\n\nWas it all in my head?\n\n\n\nBut I saw a spark\n\nAnd I've never seen a more beautiful thing\n\nAm I just dreaming?\n\nLet's take it too far\n\n'Cause every word that you say colours me in\n\nAnd should we begin before it's too late?\n\nSay that you'll take a cigarette break\n\n\n\nAnd all these emotions ruling my head\n\nThey won't let me sleep, they won't let me sleep\n\nThey're keeping me awake\n\nFrom such a beautiful mistake\n\n\n\nBut I saw a spark\n\nAnd I've never seen a more beautiful thing\n\nI guess I was dreaming\n\nWe took it too far\n\n'Cause with every word that you said, you reeled me in\n\nWhen it was nothing, I guess it's too late\n\nOh, this bitter taste was just a cigarette break"
