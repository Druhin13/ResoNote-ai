(huh) What a fucking contradiction\nRed and blue alike should all be fuckin’ locked in prison\nEvery time I read the news it makes me mad as fuck\n\nThe shitty things that are happening keep on adding up\nAnd now we’re way to lazy and fat and dumb as a population\nTo change anything - so really I should stop complaining\nThe world is ending anyways so at the end of days\nI’ma light up 7 Js and leave this bitch hella blazed\n‘Cause we off dancing to the fiddle that the devil plays\nAnd it’s hellish ways out on centre stage\nBut really\nI’m just tryna leave a positive mark\nAs the planet and society are fallin’ apart\nI feel like we lost in the dark, and we ain’t gettin’ no help\n‘Cause Superman ain’t comin’ so we gotta fend for ourselves\n\nAnd uh - I’m all for setting goals, and trying to push the limit\nBut be realistic cause you know they say we are who we fuckin are\nYou might as well face it, cause if you can’t change it, then fuckin’ embrace it\n‘Cause\n\n[Bennett, Chris Webby]\nI'ma never give two thoughts for the mournful\n‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day\nI'ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’\nI'ma keep on livin’ this way\n(So I gotta keep rollin’)\nI’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful\n(So I gotta keep rollin’)\n‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day\n(So I gotta keep rollin’)\n\nI’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’\n(So I gotta keep rollin’)\nI’ma keep on livin’ this way\n(So I gotta keep rollin’)\n\n[ Bennett, Chris Webby]\nI’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful\n‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day\nI’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’\nI’ma keep on livin’ this way\nI’ma never give two thoughts for the mournful\n‘Cause I’m only tryna live for the day\nI’ma keep on movin’, I’ma keep on movin’\nI’ma keep on livin’ this way\n(So I gotta keep rollin’)"
