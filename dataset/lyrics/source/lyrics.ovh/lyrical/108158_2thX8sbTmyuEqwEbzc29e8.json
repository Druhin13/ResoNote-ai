  "lyrics": "You know me the best\r\nYou know my worst, see me hurt, but you don't judge\r\nThat, right there, is the scariest feeling\r\nOpening and closing up again\r\nI've been hurt so I don't trust\r\nNow here we are, staring at the ceiling\n\n\n\nI've said those words before but it was a lie\n\nAnd you deserve to hear them a thousand times\n\n\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy is it so hard to say?\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy am I in my own way?\n\nWhy do I pull you close\n\nAnd then ask you for space\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy is it so hard to say?\n\n\n\nIsn't it amazing how almost every line on our hands align\n\nWhen your hand's in mine\n\nIt's like I'm whole again, isn't that a sign\n\nI should speak my mind\n\n\n\nI've said those words before but it was a lie\n\nAnd you deserve to hear them a thousand times\n\n\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy is it so hard to say?\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy am I in my own way?\n\nWhy do I pull you close\n\nAnd then ask you for space?\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy is it so hard to say? (whoa oh, yeah)\n\n\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nIt's you there in my mind\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\n\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy is it so hard to say?\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy am I in my own way?\n\nWhy do I pull you close\n\nAnd then ask you for space\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhy is it so hard to say?\n\n\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nIt's you there in my mind (It's only you)\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nIf all it is is eight letters\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nIt's you there in my mind (you)\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nIf all it is is eight letters"
