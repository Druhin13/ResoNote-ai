  "lyrics": "It's half past when I pick you up\r\nYou say I'm early so I wait in the front\r\nHeadlights in the pitch black\r\nGood hearts in the far back\r\nI remember we were blurring the glass\r\nHot breath as the time passed\n\nSlow, well you were flipping through the radio\n\nSinging don't stop, don't stop\n\n\n\nGo where we won't think about it\n\n\n\nPretty girls on the stairs with their hopes up\n\nMaking noisy dreams\n\nSneaking smiles with the boys on the rooftops\n\nIt's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing\n\nFifty hands in the air but it's all wrong\n\nWhen their hearts all sink\n\nI feel lowest on the top floor maybe\n\nIt's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing\n\n\n\nYou trace lines on my winter thighs\n\nYou make me nervous so you're flashin' a smile\n\nYou say this is what friends do\n\nI'm all dolled up for you\n\nThere's a letter on the top of my dash\n\nIt reads \"Jones, you're a real catch\"\n\nWell, I was hoping it would work out like that\n\nBut it's a damn bust, let's just\n\n\n\nGo where we don't think about it\n\n\n\nPretty girls on the stairs with their hopes up\n\nMaking noisy dreams\n\nSneaking smiles with the boys on the rooftops\n\nIt's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing\n\nFifty hands in the air but it's all wrong\n\nWhen their hearts all sink\n\nI feel lowest on the top floor maybe\n\nIt's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing\n\n\n\nHow could we not not think about it \n\nHow could we not not think about it\n\nHow could we not not think about it\n\n\n\nLet's go where we won't think about it\n\n\n\nPretty girls on the stairs with their hopes up\n\nMaking noisy dreams\n\nSneaking smiles with the boys on the rooftops\n\nIt's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing\n\nFifty hands in the air but it's all wrong\n\nWhen their hearts all sink\n\nI feel lowest on the top floor maybe\n\nIt's a pretty thing, it's a pretty thing"
