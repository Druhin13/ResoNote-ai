  "lyrics": "Take me home\r\nTo where we belong\r\nAnd the echoes of the night\r\nWill all travel to the light\r\nAnd there's a long way to go\r\nTo the end of the world\n\nThrough rain and through snow\n\nWe will never let you go\n\n\n\nAnd when you hear my echo calling\n\n(And when you hear my echo calling)\n\nThrough gravity we'll be falling\n\n(Through gravity we'll be falling)\n\nAnd when we're lost in time and space\n\n(And when we're lost in time and space)\n\nWill you still remember my face?\n\n\n\nThese are extraordinary times. And we face an extraordinary challenge\n\nThe dramatic achievements which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take\n\n\n\nTake me home\n\nTo where we belong\n\nAnd the echoes of the night\n\nWill all travel to the light\n\nThere's a long way to go\n\nTo the end of the world\n\nThrough rain and through snow\n\nWe will never let you go"
