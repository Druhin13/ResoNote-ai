  "lyrics": "Sycophants storm the gate\r\nIn vermin-hordes they swarm\r\nContorted faces gripping torches in the afterglow\r\nFirst they castigate, then they obfuscate\r\nTruth is the void where reality will end\n\nThe foulest walk among us\n\nJanus-faced and starry-eyed\n\nMarch to the piper's tune\n\nLike rats they’ll follow - you just need a song to lead them\n\n\n\nServants fawning, I Disavow\n\nThis vile calling - I Disavow\n\n\n\nWho fears the anarchist? Who fears the terrorist?\n\nTruth is the void where reality will end\n\n\n\nFictionaries fabricate\n\nAnd faccinate the minds of youth\n\nPosturing partisans\n\nWho fuel this nightmare with their solipsistic bullshit\n\n\n\nServants fawning, I Disavow\n\nThis vile calling - I Disavow\n\n\n\nSwastikinder, casualties of reason—your god's a man of straw\n\n\n\nVentriloquists, veritas in absentia\n\nArchetypes of a species yet to come\n\nThe die is cast—no question's ever answered\n\nA downward spiral into vertigo’s arms\n\n\n\nWho fears the anarchist? Who fears the terrorist?\n\nTruth is the void where reality will end\n\n\n\nA dialectic death-waltz\n\nCalled ‘cards against reality'\n\nA game we each play alone\n\nAs gaslit martyrs for the overlords that feed us\n\n\n\nServants fawning, I Disavow\n\nThis vile calling - I Disavow and repudiate in full\n\n\n\nThese jackals spit the venom of deception\n\n\n\nSleepwalk, no rest for the ignorant\n\nWho cry wolf as their dragged from the womb\n\nDry-dox, the pitchfork procession trolls on….and you are next"
