  "lyrics": "I know your name\r\nI told you mine\r\nWe've stopped and passed the time of day\r\nYou work in town\r\nI work at night\r\nThat gives us six until seven to work this out\n\n\n\nIf I seem a little strange\n\nIt's just the state of the heart\n\nI'm waiting here for you\n\nIn the state I'm in\n\n\n\nYou are the moon\n\nI am the sea\n\nYou pull me in and gaze on down at me\n\nI was alone\n\nI thought I was immune\n\nThe door can still be open wide\n\n\n\nIf I feel a little strange\n\nIt's just the state of the heart\n\nI'm waiting here for you\n\nIn the state I'm in\n\nIt's just the state of the heart\n\nI wait in the dark\n\nI the state I'm in\n\n\n\nWe get closer and closer\n\nTo falling out or falling in\n\nI go over and over\n\nBut I can't change the state\n\nThis heart is in\n\n\n\nIf I seem a little strange\n\nIt's just the state of the heart\n\nI'm waiting here for you\n\nIn the state I'm in\n\nIt's just the state of the heart\n\nYou know I wait in the dark\n\nIn the state I'm in\n\nIt 's the state of the heart\n\nThe state of the heart, oh\n\nThe state of the heart\n\nThe state of the heart, oh"
