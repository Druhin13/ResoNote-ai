  "lyrics": "Started off so sweet, take you out to eat\r\nBut rolling home at 5AM\r\nWe go out every night chasing those cheap highs\r\nWish we could do that again\r\nBut now you're hurting and I'm hurting\r\nWe ain't learning from all our mistakes\n\nYou're frustrated, it's complicated\n\nAll these changes, do you feel the same?\n\n\n\nWe used to spend every Friday night searching for them thrills\n\nWandering 'round in ecstasy, but didn't take the pills\n\nSo now I got blood shot eyes on a Sunday night\n\nFell asleep on the sofa but I've never felt closer to you\n\nCloser to you, you\n\n\n\nYou were new to the city, but put your trust in me\n\nSwore no one would hold my love\n\nAnd those words still stand true\n\nI will stay by you even when you've had enough, oh\n\n\n\nWe used to spend every Friday night searching for them thrills\n\nWandering 'round in ecstasy, but didn't take the pills\n\nSo now I got blood shot eyes on a Sunday night\n\nFell asleep on the sofa but I've never felt closer to you\n\nCloser to you, you, closer to you, closer to you\n\n\n\nWas so easy baby, but we never learn\n\nThose times were crazy, yeah\n\nAnd I miss you lately and the way we were\n\nBut things got too crazy\n\n\n\nWe used to spend every Friday night searching for them thrills\n\nWandering 'round in ecstasy, but didn't take the pills (Didn't take the pills)\n\nSo now I got blood shot eyes on a Sunday night\n\nFell asleep on the sofa but I've never felt closer to you\n\nCloser to you, you, you\n\n\n\nI've never felt closer to you"
