Shalalalala... Shalalalala... (so bad, oh yeah), 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\n\nI won't be alright\n\nI won't be alright\n\nI won't be alright [?]\n\nI won't be alright\n\nI won't be alright\n\nI won't be alright [?] oh yeah\n\nSo say that I really need you so bad, oh yeah\n\nNo not so typical love song\n\n'Cause it hurt us again and again"
