Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience\n\nThem prices ain’t real without inflation\n\nI done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit\n\nMoynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it\n\nSee through it, neck, igloo it\n\nHabla en español, I y tu it\n\nLet Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers\n\nI'll ensure you gettin' every gram from us\n\nLet's cram numbers, easily\n\nThe only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E\n\nHow could you ever right these wrongs\n\nWhen you don't even write your songs?\n\nBut let us all play along\n\nWe all know what niggas for real been waitin' on, Push"
