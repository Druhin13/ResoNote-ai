Don't you lie\n\nSee, I told you so\n\n\n\nYour broken heart is all my fault\n\nThere's no room to disguise\n\nOh, don't you cry, don't you cry\n\n\n\nOh, you said it yourself, you said it yourself\n\nWhat you said, when you said what you need from me\n\n\n\nAll apologies won't make things right with you tonight\n\nOh, can't you see, you're dragging me, I'm your favorite toy\n\nOh, I'm so sorry but make up your mind, we're out of time\n\nOh, mama, please, I'm on my knees, I'm your favorite boy\n\n\n\nYour favorite boy, your favorite boy\n\nYour favorite boy, your favorite boy\n\nYour favorite boy, your favorite boy\n\n\n\nOh, you said it yourself, you said it yourself\n\nWhat you said, when you said what you need from me\n\n\n\nAll apologies won't make things right for you tonight\n\nOh, can't you see , you're dragging me, I'm your favorite toy\n\nOh, I'm so sorry but make up your mind, we're out of time\n\nOh, mama, please, I'm on my knees, I'm your favorite boy"
