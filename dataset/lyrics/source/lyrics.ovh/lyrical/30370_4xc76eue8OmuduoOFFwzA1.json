  "lyrics": "Our love was strong as a lion\r\nSoft as the cotton you lie in\r\nTimes we got hot like an iron\r\nYou and I\r\nOur hearts had never been broken\r\nWe were so innocent darling\n\nWe used to talk 'til the morning\n\nYou and I\n\n\n\nWe had that mixtape on every weekend\n\nHad it repeating, had it repeating\n\n\n\nYou were my September song, summer lasted too long\n\nTime moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen\n\nYou were my September Song, tell me where have you gone\n\nDo you remember me? We were only fifteen\n\nAnd I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for u\n\nYou were my September song, tell me where have you gone\n\nDo you remember me? We were only fifteen\n\n\n\nSometimes I think that I see your\n\nFace in the strangest of places\n\nDown on the underground station\n\nPassing by\n\nI get a mad sense of danger\n\nFeel like my heart couldn't take it\n\n'Cause if we met we'd be strangers\n\nYou and I\n\n\n\nStill, I play that mixtape every weekend\n\nGot it repeating, got it repeating\n\n\n\nYou were my September song, summer lasted too long\n\nTime moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen\n\nYou were my September song, tell me where have you gone?\n\nDo you remember me? We were only fifteen\n\nAnd I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us\n\nI hear that September song, that I'm singing along\n\nThinking about you and me, oh, what a melody\n\n\n\nAnd as the years go by\n\nYou will still be my, be my (September song)\n\nYou are my (September song)\n\n\n\nYou were my September song, summer lasted too long\n\nTime moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen\n\nYou were my September song, tell me where have you gone\n\nDo you remember me? We were only fifteen\n\nAnd I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us\n\nYou were my September song, tell me where have you gone\n\nDo you remember me? We were only fifteen"
