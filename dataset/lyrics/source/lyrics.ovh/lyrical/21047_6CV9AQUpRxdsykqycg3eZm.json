  "lyrics": "Headed down to the crossroads\r\nTo find my Lucy in the sky\r\nTo spread these wings, to feel that glory\r\nFor that I'd give my life\r\nHell yeah, up all night\n\nDancin' with the devil till the morning light\n\nOh no, got nothing to lose\n\nSelling my soul for a life with you\n\nYeah... To the devil with angel eyes\n\n\n\nSo many strangers at my table\n\nAll tryin' to tell me who I am\n\n(They'll never tell me who I am)\n\nOh but I can read between their lies\n\nAnd they'll never understand\n\n\n\nHell yeah, up all night\n\nDancin' with the devil till the morning's light\n\nOh no, got nothing to lose\n\nSelling my soul for a life with you\n\nYeah... To the devil with angel eyes\n\n\n\nYeah!\n\n\n\nOh I rode those wings of glory\n\nI've crashed and burned in the flames of pride\n\nI've gone the distance, to tell my story, yeah\n\nNow I'm ready to fight, oh\n\n\n\nHell yeah, up all night\n\nDancin' with the devil till the morning light\n\nOh no, got nothing to lose\n\nSelling my soul for a life with you\n\nYeah\n\nTo the devil with angel eyes\n\nYeah\n\nTo hell with the devil\n\n\n\nSay goodbye\n\nSay goodbye\n\nSay goodbye\n\nSay goodbye\n\n\n\nOn my way to the crossroads"
