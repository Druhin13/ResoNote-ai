  "lyrics": "You don't have to go, you can stay here with me\r\nI'll get the next round, you finish your drink\r\nWe can get drunk and go stare at the moon\r\nWe might be dead soon\r\nWe all need a place where we lay down our guns\n\nIf it don't work out I'm not one to judge\n\nWhy don't you come over? I don't work till noon\n\nAnd we might be dead soon\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nI'm down, fuck it\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\n\n\nLet go, live it\n\nLet go, live it\n\nLet go, live it\n\n\n\nI get so nervous how I could go wrong\n\nBut in a moment it all could be gone\n\nPretend we've got nothing important to do\n\n'Cause we might be dead soon\n\nCan give you tomorrow, can give you tonight\n\nYou're wasting my time was the time of my life\n\nI don't wanna worry, I just wanna spoon\n\n'Cause we might be dead soon\n\n\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nI'm down, fuck it\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nLet go, live it\n\nLet go, live it\n\nLet go, live it\n\nFuck it\n\n\n\nAnd if we don't see another life\n\nThen at least we had tonight\n\nAnd if we look back and wonder why\n\nMade me feel alive, I feel alive\n\n\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nI'm down, fuck it\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\nWhere you wanna go?\n\n\n\nLet go, live it\n\nLet go, live it\n\nLet go, live it\n\nFuck it\n\nLet go, live it"
