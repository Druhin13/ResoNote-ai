  "lyrics": "Heavy we’re rolling into the ocean\r\nDeep as a love, crawls with emotion\r\nDip in your finger, taste from this water\r\nAnd stir me up, darling\r\nWaves that are still are brought into motion\n\nTime that we spent, foolishly cautioned\n\nSip on this water, taste from this heartbeat\n\nAnd stir me up, darling\n\n\n\nAnd even when we’re lost, we find a way to our glory\n\nEven at all cost we find a way to our glory\n\nHey hey, hey hey, oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nHey hey, hey hey, oh oh, oh oh oh\n\n\n\nSteady we’re holding up as two\n\nAnd all of our days are made new\n\nSing to the valley run to the river\n\nAnd stir me up, darling\n\n\n\nIn every way, follow my pattern\n\nGently, steady, as we move\n\nThis love is cold, cold like the season\n\nSo stir me up, darling\n\n\n\nAnd even when we’re lost, we find a way to our glory\n\nEven at all cost, we find a way to our glory, a way to our glory\n\nHey hey, hey hey, oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nHey hey, hey hey, oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nHey hey, hey hey, oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nHey hey, hey hey, oh oh, oh oh oh\n\nAnd even when we’re lost, we find a way to our glory\n\nEven at all cost, we find a way to our glory, a way to our glory"
