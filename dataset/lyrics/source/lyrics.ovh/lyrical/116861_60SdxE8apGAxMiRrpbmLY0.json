Where my drink? This my day, lucky you\n\nFuck you too, woah!\n\n\n\nY'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move\n\nGive me some room, give me some room, give me the juice\n\nHop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?\n\nY'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice\n\n\n\nBack on my bullshit, my back to the wall\n\nTurn my back on you all and you're finished\n\nBack to these bullets, it's back to the job\n\nPull my MAC out and all of you runnin'\n\nBack on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'\n\nThese packs and I'm actually pumpin'\n\nCan't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'\n\nYou might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'\n\nI'm actually buzzin' this time\n\nStraight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine\n\nI do not fuck with you guys\n\nIf I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time\n\nI ain't no gangster but I got some bangers\n\nSome chains and some blades in and a couple of knives\n\nChoppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree\n\nMy twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies\n\nWhy don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)\n\nThey say I talk like a chulo (chulo)\n\nI live in Mars, I'm not Bruno\n\nBitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo\n\nYou play your cards, I reverse on you all\n\nAnd I might just drop four like an Uno\n\nCállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo\n\nThey've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto\n\nLookin' for something that prolly can never find out\n\nShake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now\n\nWhat you would nigga? You really want me tied down\n\nI've been alone and I never needed nobody\n\nJust only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down\n\nKeep all of the money, I never wanted the lifestyle\n\nI just pray to God that my son'll be alright now\n\nI said ain't no love for the other side\n\nOr anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)\n\nWhen I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope\n\nYou in the wrong cab down the wrong path\n\nNigga wrong way, the wrong road\n\nSnakes in the grass tryna slither fast\n\nI just bought a fuckin' lawn mower\n\n\n\nI have said a lotta things in my day, I admit it\n\nThis is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it\n\nI done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em\n\nWasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition\n\nFuck's the difference?\n\nI'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules\n\nMan I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose\n\nI been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full\n\nI just ate, lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me\n\nFuck you think? (woo!)\n\n\n\nI got a couple of mansions\n\nStill I don't have any manners\n\nYou got a couple of ghost writers\n\nBut to these kids it don't actually matter\n\nThey're askin' me, \"What the fuck happened to hip-hop?\"\n\nI said, \"I don't have any answers.\"\n\n'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album\n\nIt hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers\n\nAnd actually comin' from humble beginnings\n\nI'm somewhat uncomfortable winning\n\nI wish I could say \"What a wonderful feeling!\"\n\nWe're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling\n\nBut nothin' is stealing like anyone has any fuckin' ability\n\nTo even stick to a subject, it's killin' me, the inability to pin humility\n\nHatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of fuckin'\n\nSongs about nothin' and mumble!\n\nAnd fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular\n\nShit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up\n\nDon't give an ounce of a motherfuck\n\nAbout the ones that were here before you to make raps, it's recap\n\nWay back, MC's that recap and tape decks\n\nADAT's with the G raps and Kane's hat\n\nWe need 3 stacks ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back\n\nBecause half of these rappers have brain damage\n\nAll the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap\n\nI don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad\n\nBut in fact with a old-me at the same cat that would take that\n\nFeedback and aim back, I need that\n\nBut I think it's inevitable\n\nThey all got button to press or a lever to pull\n\nThey give me the snap though (lil' bitch)\n\nAnd if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big\n\nBut you've been takin' the dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)\n\nOn the brink in a minute\n\nGot me thinkin' of finishin' everything\n\nWith acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits\n\nI'ma sleep at the wheel again\n\nAs I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent\n\nOf another beat 'em and kill again\n\n'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again\n\nEven ketamine or methamphetamine with the Manidon\n\nIt better be at least 70 to 300 milligram\n\nAnd I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again\n\nLevels to this shit, I got an elevator\n\nYou could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker\n\nI sound like a broken record every time I break a record\n\nNobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator\n\nMotherfucker never got a right to be this way\n\nI got spite inside my DNA\n\nBut I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy\n\nIt's the moment y'all been waitin' for\n\nLike California wishin' rain would pour\n\nAnd that drought y'all have been prayin' for\n\nMy downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw\n\nStill the same Marshall that outlaw\n\nThat they say is a writer might've fell off\n\nBut back on that bull like the cowboys\n\n\n\nSo y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move\n\nGive me some room, give me some room, give me the juice\n\nHop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?\n\nY'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"
