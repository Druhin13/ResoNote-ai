I’m here\n\n\n\nShow me how you’re proud\n\nTell me how you reach the moon\n\n\n\nMy thoughts err away tonight\n\nMy heart fell to love again\n\n\n\nI’m turning around I’m having visions of you\n\nBut then I understand\n\nThe friend I’m dreaming of is far away\n\nAnd doesn’t feel my love\n\nBut I do... I do"
