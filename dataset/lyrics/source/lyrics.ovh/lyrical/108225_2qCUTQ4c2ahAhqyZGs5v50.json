  "lyrics": "Say goodbye to all your pain and sorrow\r\nSay goodbye to all those lonely nights\r\nSay goodbye to all your blue tomorrows\r\nNow you're standing in the light\r\nI know sometimes you feel so helpless\n\nSometimes you feel like you can't win\n\nSometimes you feel so isolated\n\nYou'll never have to feel that way again\n\n\n\nYou are not alone\n\nYou're not alone\n\n\n\nNever thought I'd find the road to freedom\n\nNever thought I'd see you smile again\n\nNever thought I'd have the chance to tell you\n\nThat I will always be your friend\n\n\n\nYou are not alone\n\nYou're not alone"
