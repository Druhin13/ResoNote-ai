  "lyrics": "Looking up into the sky\r\nI still wonder why it still hurts\r\n'Cause when I'm weak, incomplete\r\nI just stop and stare for all I am\r\nBut when it feels like I am giving up\r\nI try to see the light inside\n\nNow I'm down on my knees\n\nWondering what we could be if you were mine\n\n\n\nIt feels like rainy days\n\nI'm trying to breathe, I'm trying to see clear\n\nI fade away\n\nBecause your silhouette has the shape of my regret\n\nBecause your silhouette has the shape of my regret\n\nBecause your silhouette has the shape of my regret\n\n\n\nCounting stars through the night\n\nIs the only peace that I have found\n\nAnd when I see shooting stars\n\nPlacing down in the dark I feel your skin\n\nAnd you always saw the best in me\n\nWhen I only saw the worst in me\n\nNow I wish I could say things like\n\n'Hey, I know what you meant'\n\n\n\nIt feels like rainy days\n\nI'm trying to breathe, I'm trying to see clear\n\nI fade away\n\nBecause your silhouette has the shape of my regret\n\nBecause your silhouette has the shape of my regret\n\nBecause your silhouette has the shape of my regret"
