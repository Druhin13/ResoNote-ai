(Brr Brr)\n\nBoy you need to focus on your health\n\nWork out proper, eat more veggies, drink more water\n\nTomorrows not promised for yourself\n\nI'm distracted this the last time I'm relapsing\n\nEarth & happy potions oh how swell\n\nNow what you up to oh not too much shit let's cut loose\n\nMatch in heaven fires set in hell\n\n\n\nAnd I know I know I know I know\n\nI care about everybody else\n\nI should make some time baby, I need to make time for myself\n\nI know I know I know I know\n\nI worry about everybody else\n\nI should make some time baby, I need to make time for myself..\n\n\n\nTime\n\nAll in due time\n\nI am like God in design\n\nI put my heart on the line\n\nNo I'm not the worrying kind\n\nBut I can not hurry what's mine\n\nMy daddy made dishes & sent me well wishes black chicken rice curry & thyme\n\nMoney don't matter my way\n\nMentals been lathered in rage\n\nCompartmentalizing my judgement on others elitist when asked of my day\n\nThey are not better than I\n\nBut am I much better than self?\n\nWhat's better than you as you are?\n\nWhat's better than truth in yo heart?\n\nI pull up where niggas can't see me\n\nI need some space to move freely\n\nJust in case niggas go postal\n\nFuck out my way I don't know you\n\nThis is not twitter nigga do not be confused by the result of them protools\n\nLet's keep it civil & noble\n\nGentrification & Whole Foods\n\nI wanna be more than expected\n\nI'm talking well & respected\n\nI'm talking vanity levels that might make the devil look back with obsession\n\nGod got a lock on my heart, Lucy clench onto my flesh\n\nYou give him the will to seek out on free thrills add a conscience & what you expect\n\n\n\nI care about everybody else\n\nI need to make time for myself"
