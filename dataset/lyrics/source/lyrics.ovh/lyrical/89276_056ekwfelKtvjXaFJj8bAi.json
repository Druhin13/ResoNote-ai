  "lyrics": "I lost my faith a long time ago\r\nPuttin' miles on this old road\r\nI lost my family and I lost my soul\r\n800 miles and one more show\r\nStill workin' these fingers to the bone\n\nWhen the show is over I sit alone\n\nWell the angels and devils are my only friends\n\nI wake up in the morning and I do it again\n\n\n\nI don't know what you've been told\n\nAll the whiskey in the world won't save my soul\n\nI've done it all so where do I begin\n\nTo fix all the messes and the state I'm in\n\n\n\nIt's hard\n\nYeah it's hard\n\n\n\nI feel like there's a better way\n\nTo make it through another day\n\nSo sad that life turned out like this\n\n'Cause I still taste you on my lips\n\n\n\nWell I don't know what you've been told\n\nAll the whiskey in the world won't save my soul\n\nI've done it all so where do I begin\n\nTo fix all the messes and the state I'm in\n\n\n\nIt's hard\n\nMmh it's hard\n\nYeah it's hard\n\nMmh it's hard"
