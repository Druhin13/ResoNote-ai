  "lyrics": "You can't say shit you little pale bastard and fuck all y'all, suck my dick\r\nI was woken from silence\r\nTorn from my dreams\r\nA life less than perfect\r\nMore rips at the seams\n\nYou can’t sew me together\n\nTo fix what’s been done\n\nI’ve felt it all but I can’t feel numb\n\nI’ve felt it all but I can’t feel numb\n\nI’ve felt it all but I can’t feel numb\n\n\n\nSo stay away\n\nWe’ve been down this road before\n\nBeen barely holding on for so long\n\n(For so long)\n\n\n\nSo keep spitting me out\n\nA bad taste in your mouth\n\nYou always say to yourself that you’ll change\n\n\n\nSo stay away\n\nWe’ve been down this road before\n\nBeen barely holding on for so long\n\n(For so long)\n\nIt’s safe to say\n\nI can’t do this anymore\n\nAnd I’m not the only one\n\nIt’s so wrong\n\n\n\nTake this for what it’s worth\n\nYou should know, this is cutthroat\n\nCutthroat\n\n\n\nSo stay away\n\nWe’ve been down this road before\n\nBeen barely holding on for so long\n\nIt’s safe to say\n\nI can’t do this anymore\n\nI’m not the only one\n\nIt’s so wrong\n\n\n\nSo stay away\n\nWe’ve been down this road before\n\nBeen barely holding on for so long\n\n(For so long)\n\nIt’s safe to say\n\nI can’t do this anymore\n\nAnd I’m not the only one\n\nIt’s so wrong"
