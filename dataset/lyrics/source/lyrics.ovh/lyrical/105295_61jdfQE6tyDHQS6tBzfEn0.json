  "lyrics": "Sweet honey I can feel you in my veins I don’t wanna feel the pain you can take it all away\r\nPink flower I can feel you in my hair when you hear the words I say could you make\r\nYourself aware\r\nAh ah ah\r\nYour beautiful mind is far too pretty to understand mine\r\nBut why it feels so right when those hazel eyes look straight into mine\n\nWithout you I don’t know what I would cease to do\n\nI don’t know what I would do\n\nWithout you all I would ever see is the color blue\n\nAll id see is blue\n\nSweet lover when you kiss away my tears\n\nI go up into cloud nine and forget all of my fears\n\nOh\n\nI still feel the same as I did last December\n\nKissed your lips for the first time\n\nA time without you I don’t wanna remember\n\nOh no\n\nYour beautiful mind is far too pretty to understand mine\n\nBut why it feels so right when those hazel eyes look straight into mine\n\nWithout you I don’t know what I would cease to do\n\nI don’t know what I would do\n\nWithout you all I would ever see is the color blue\n\nAll id see is blue\n\nSweet universe you finally did it right\n\nYou brought up all of my hopes\n\nAnd brought love into my life\n\nOh your beautiful mind is far too pretty to understand mine\n\nBut why it feel so right every time I look into your hazel eyes"
