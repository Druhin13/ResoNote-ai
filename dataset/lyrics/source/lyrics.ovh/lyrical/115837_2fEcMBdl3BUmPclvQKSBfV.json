  "lyrics": "Kids get high in the basement sometimes\r\nAnd tell themselves not to watch the screens\r\nIt’s the blood that haunts me, I can’t fall asleep\r\n'Cause it's ruthless, and don’t tell me you’re ruthless too\r\nWhen there is blood on the streets of Baltimore\n\nKids are getting ready for a long war\n\nMaybe I was born in the wrong skin\n\nBut those sheep are rolling in the mud again\n\n\n\nOh, it haunts me, tell me it haunts you too\n\nYou cut it up, you cut it up, but it’s still the red white and the blue\n\nYou cut it up, you cut it up, but it’s still the red white and the blue\n\n\n\nWasted, in the tangles of time\n\nAnd my baby, is she the only one left when it’s dire?\n\nShe said a change is gonna come, but it’s all on us\n\n'Cause it’s ruthless and don’t tell me you’re ruthless too\n\n\n\nWhen there is blood on the streets of Baltimore\n\nKids are getting ready for a long war\n\nMaybe I was born in the wrong skin\n\nBut those sheep are rolling in the mud again\n\n\n\nOh, it haunts me, tell me it haunts you too\n\nYou cut it up, you cut it up, but it’s still the red white and the blue\n\nYou cut it up, you cut it up, but it’s still the red white and the blue\n\n\n\nWhen there is blood on the streets of Baltimore\n\nKids are getting ready for a long war\n\nMaybe I was born in the wrong skin\n\nBut those sheep are rolling in the mud again\n\n\n\nOh, it haunts me, tell me it haunts you too\n\nOh, it haunts me 'cause their freedom was paid in blood\n\nYou cut it up, you cut it up, but it’s still the red white and the blue\n\nYou cut it up, you cut it up, but it’s still the red white and the blue"
