  "lyrics": "Little birds hidden in your perch\nTravel about and you never take them out\nLittle creatures flying off the page\nA little prisoner you can lock up in a cage\n\nTropical birds love to get away\n\nYou wanna keep them but they never wanna stay\n\nLittle creatures, innocent and free\n\nYou twisted sisters only wanna clip their wings\n\n\n\nI've kept them most my life\n\n\n\nIt's the colorful feathers that hold me together and keep me from crumbling in a mess on the floor\n\nWhen they fly through the sky I feel something inside\n\nI don't know what it is but it is magic\n\n\n\nIt's the colorful feathers that hold me together and keep me from crumbling in a mess on the floor\n\nWhen they fly through the sky I feel something inside\n\nI don't know what it is but it is magic"
