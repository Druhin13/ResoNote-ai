(haaa)\n\n\n\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\n\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\n\nBow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\n\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo\n\nYou a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat\n\nYou're a tough guy, that's enough jokes\n\nThen the sun die, the night is young though\n\nThe diamonds still shine, get it rough hoe\n\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\n\nFive, four, three, two, where the ones go?\n\nIt's a shit show, put you front row\n\nTalkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show\n\nMoney over bitches, and above hoes\n\nThat is still my favorite love quote\n\nPut the gun inside, what the fuck for?\n\nI sleep with the gun, then she don't snore\n\nWhat the fuck yo? Where the love go?\n\nTrade the ski mask, for the muzzle\n\nIt's a blood bath, where the Suds go?\n\nIt's a Swizz beat, down the drums go\n\nIf she's iffy, down the drugs go\n\nIf she sip lean, double cup toast\n\nI gotta duffle full of hundos\n\nDown the love go, where's the uproar?\n\n\n\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\n\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\n\nBow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\n\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo\n\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\n\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\n\nBow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\n\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo\n\n\n\nGet the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro'\n\nI come out the scuffle without a scuff, bro\n\nPuff, puff, bro, I don't huff though\n\nYellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke\n\nAt your front door with a gun stowed\n\n\"Knock-knock, who's there\" is how it won't go\n\nThis the jungle so have the utmost\n\nFor the nutzos, and we nuts, so\n\nWhat the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro\n\nWe grew up fast, we rolled up slow\n\nWe throw up gang signs, she throw up dope\n\nDreadlock hang down like a bando\n\nPut the green in the bag, like a lawnmower\n\nHair trigger pulled back like a cornrow\n\nExtra clip in the stash like a console\n\nListenin' to Bono, you listen to Don O\n\nWhat the fuck bro? Where the love go?\n\nSwizzy, you a chef, I like my lunch gross\n\nJust look up, bro, there the stars go\n\nI see the shovel, but where the drugs go? Hmm\n\nTo the unknown\n\nOnly way he comin' back is through his unborns\n\nIf you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord\n\nIt's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?\n\n\n\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\n\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\n\nBow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\n\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo\n\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\n\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\n\nBow, get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\n\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo"
