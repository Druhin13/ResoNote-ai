  "title": "Growin' Up",
  "lyrics": "I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade\r\nI combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade\r\nI was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch\r\nI strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul\r\nuntouched\r\nI hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Sit down' I stood up\n\nOoh-ooh growin' up \n\nThe flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing\n\nI had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldn't sail but she sure could sing\n\nI pushed B-52 and bombed `em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing\n\nI broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to landing \n\nI hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Come down' I threw up\n\nOoh-ooh growin' up\n\n\n\nI took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know it's really hard to hold your breath\n\nI swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid\n\nWell my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little\n\nplace in the stars\n\nI swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car\n\nI hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said `Sit down' I stood up\n\nOoh-ooh growin' up\n\nOoh-ooh growin' up"
