Oh, no\nRoll up some more blue dream\nBackwoods, loose leaf\nPour up JD, boyfriend ain't me\nChoices ain't free\n\nBut it's hard for me to say no\nI just wanna live fast while I'm young\nI don't really wanna wait, no\nNever ever been one to\nTravel on the safe road, no\nBroken hearts and regrets\nI got a whole safe for\nDo you wanna be the next one, yeah\n\n[Goody Grace]\nI come alive in the night\nShine in the light of the moon\nI'm thinkin' maybe tonight\nWe can lose sight of our views\nBut I just don't have the time to be out calling for you\nYou must be out of your mind to think that I'm falling for you\n\n\n[lil aaron]\nYeah\nYou must be crazy to think you my baby\nJust tryna get faded, back up my Mercedes\nI ain't tryna love you, I'm just tryna fuck you\nI'm just tryna hit, sorry to burst your bubble?\nShawty gave me brain bumpin' glowing pains\nI ain't even know her name but that shit was great\nI ain't even know her name but she knew mine\nHit it once, I ain't never hit it two times\n\n[ Goody Grace]\nGirl, you know I can't stay\nToo much money to make\nI gotta go get paid, yeah, yeah, yeah\nAnd I can't even lie\n\nGot two hoes on the side\nAin't going home tonight, nah, no\n\n[Goody Grace]\nI come alive in the night\nShine in the light of the moon\nI'm thinkin' maybe tonight\nWe can lose sight of our views\nBut I just don't have the time to be out calling for you\nYou must be out of your mind to think that I'm falling for you\n\n[ Goody Grace]\nYou must be out of your mind to think that I'm falling for you"
