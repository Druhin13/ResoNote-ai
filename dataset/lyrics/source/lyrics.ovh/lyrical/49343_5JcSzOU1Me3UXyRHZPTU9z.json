  "lyrics": "Broken down from a life unsteady\r\nA tale already known\r\nPierce the dawn and the Lord breathes heavy\r\nUpon your burning soul, alright\r\nInnocent and heartless\n\nDelusion by your side\n\nBlinded by reality\n\nCan you stand the test of time?\n\nStand the test of time\n\n\n\nForget to feel and unfold what's real\n\nThe rules, they don't apply\n\nWings appear as your death draws near\n\nReaching for the sky\n\n\n\nEternity is long gone\n\nDelusion overdrive\n\nDriven by the darkness\n\nNow the thief has stole your prime\n\nEternal losing mind\n\n\n\nSchizophrenic eclipse\n\nBites the tongue, steals the light\n\nMonolithic madness\n\nVertigo taking flight\n\nEternal losing mind\n\n\n\nPraise the fear, no end is near\n\nYou're begging for the lesser\n\nWhen triumph comes you remain undone\n\nDoes the distant life seem better?\n\n\n\nEternity is long gone\n\nDelusion overdrive\n\nDriven by the darkness\n\nNow the thief has stole your prime\n\nEternal losing mind"
