  "lyrics": "Make amends with that old friend\r\nYou swore you'd never never talk to again\r\nBecause you miss him\r\nCall up your mom on the telephone\r\nTalk a whole lot of nothing til the cows come home\r\nAnd listen\n\nCross every T, down rows the odds [?]\n\n'Cause years grow wings and fly on by\n\nAnd time slips through your fingers just like sand\n\n\n\nBecause everything you thought would last forever\n\nNever lasts forever, like you plan\n\nDon't let your night become another\n\nSo take life by the hands while you still can\n\n\n\nGet your daddy to tell that same old joke\n\nAnd laugh between the jack and coke\n\nAnd hope one day you'll be half as funny\n\nCount your blessings and your stars\n\nIt's in the air and who you are\n\nIt's about the wealth you give\n\nIt sure as hell ain't about the money\n\n\n\nBecause everything you thought would last forever\n\nNever lasts forever like you plan\n\nDon't let your night become another\n\nSo take life by the hands while you still can\n\n\n\nYou just imagine\n\nAnything can happen if you live every moment like your last\n\n\n\nBecause everything you thought would last forever\n\nNever lasts forever like you plan\n\nDon't let your night become another\n\nSo take life by the hands while you still can"
