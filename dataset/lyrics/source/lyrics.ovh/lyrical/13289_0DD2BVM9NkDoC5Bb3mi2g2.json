  "lyrics": "If she don't love me, what can I do?\r\nJust put on my best pair of shoes\r\nBecause I, I'm me\r\nBecause she said, \"he's the one that drill the charms\r\nHoney let's go wrong\"\r\nI just want to know\n\nWhat's wrong with me?\n\nBeing in love with you\n\n\n\n9th grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket\n\nLaw slain go only Django\n\nSnap he accomplished\n\nThat's where my props go\n\nThat's where my pops went\n\nSee my percentage is a pennant to the planet\n\nKnock it out the ball park, Frankie\n\nI should not tire this tire\n\nTo a better love, let the wings spread\n\nIt'll always come back, baby\n\nCome back, shellac black, baby\n\nA come back, flat black paint on a Chevy\n\n\n\nIf she don't love me, what can I do?\n\nJust put on my best pair of shoes\n\nBecause I'm me\n\nBecause I, I'm me\n\nBecause I, I'm me\n\nBecause I'm me, I'm me\n\n\n\nNever mind my tone when I told Pretty Tony\n\nListen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony\n\nAward-winning walk when you running with a shottie\n\nWhy you running from us?\n\nWhy you messing with us?\n\nWe ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness\n\nThe Grizzly, maybe Polar\n\nYou ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up\n\nPulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper\n\nAnd let's roll out baby\n\n\n\nI just want to know\n\nWhat's wrong with me?"
