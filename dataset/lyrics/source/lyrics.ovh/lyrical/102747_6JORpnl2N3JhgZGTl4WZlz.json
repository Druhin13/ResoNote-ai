  "lyrics": "Long gone the days of summer\r\nIn L.A. it stretches longer\r\nFading, waiting\r\nTry to heal but the pain it won't go\r\nStart with less always seems to cost more\r\nHating, breaking\n\n\n\nRemember, come December\n\nOne day can last forever\n\nAin't nowhere that's safe for a lowly pretender\n\nI'm shooting straight for the target center\n\n\n\nMaybe you should know\n\nI'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nGot no desire to watch the last tear fall\n\nMaybe this will show\n\nI'm reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah\n\nMaybe I don't know\n\nYou anymore and I'm smiling\n\nOur burden is untied\n\nLet it die\n\n\n\nI'd be lying if I said it felt right\n\nEven though I got a dog in this fight\n\nWounded, losing\n\nPeople talk, in and out the words go\n\nTo be the one from where the wind it does blow\n\nHounded, surrounded\n\n\n\nRemember, come December\n\nOne life can live forever\n\nAin't nowhere that's safe for a lowly pretender\n\nI'm shooting straight for the target center\n\n\n\nMaybe you should know\n\nI'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nGot no desire to watch the last tear fall\n\nMaybe this will show\n\nI'm reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah\n\nMaybe I don't know\n\nYou anymore and I'm smiling\n\nOur burden is untied\n\nLet it die\n\n\n\nMaybe you should know\n\nI'm feeling lonely and I'm tired, oh yeah\n\nMaybe I should go\n\nGot no desire to watch the last tear fall\n\nMaybe this will show\n\nI'm reeling, empty, uninspired, oh yeah\n\nMaybe I don't know\n\nYou anymore and I'm smiling\n\nOur burden is untied\n\nLet it die"
