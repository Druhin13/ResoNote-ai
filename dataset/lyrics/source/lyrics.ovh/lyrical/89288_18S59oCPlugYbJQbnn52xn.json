  "lyrics": "I cleaned out your dresser, found some joints\r\nMy sister smoked 'em, I didn’t see the point\r\nAnd everyone keeps sayin' that I look just like you\r\nLife don't seem so alone anymore\r\nThe day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band\n\nThe day my daddy died, I held my mama’s hand\n\nI cried my tears, then dried 'em up\n\nPut my face inside my hands\n\nThe day my daddy died, I became a man\n\n\n\nThe cops came, they did not take off their shoes\n\nPeople hug me, I smell like 10,000 perfumes\n\nGave away the wheelchair, you're gone, but I'm still here\n\nJanuary in Detroit is cold as fuck\n\n\n\nThe day my daddy died, I damn near quit the band\n\nThe day my daddy died, I held my mama's hand\n\nI cried my tears, then dried 'em up\n\nPut my face inside my hands\n\nThe day my daddy died, I became a man\n\nThe day my daddy died, I became a man\n\n\n\nI love you a lot\n\nI love you, too\n\nRemind me to let you run away if you need to run places, like the basement. I mean, that's what it's a part, isn’t it? Being an individual\n\nYeah, letting people go\n\nYeah\n\nRemind me to let you go, too, if you need to\n\nAbsolutely\n\nI love you\n\nI love you so much. You’re gonna put that into a song?"
