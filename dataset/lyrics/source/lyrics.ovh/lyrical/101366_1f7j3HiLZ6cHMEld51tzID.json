Don't things taste better when we're naked?\n\nI gotta tell you I - whoops\n\nSorry I'll get that, that was...\n\nWHOA Whoa whoa. Sorry sorry sorry. Sorry, that was me\n\n\n\nNow it's later at night, and the mood is right for lovin\n\nIt's our 3 day anniversary, let's celebrate\n\nReservation for two at a candlelight dinner\n\nRight inside your own bathroom, what a convenient date!\n\nSit down at the tub-shaped table\n\nGive your order to the waiter\n\nAnd hold my pruney hand\n\nI also hired a harpist and mariachi band (mi amor!)\n\n\n\nEating food in the shower\n\nBut just between us I don't deny\n\nAll the drinks are watered down, there's shampoo in my tacos\n\nAlso I asked a bunch of friends if they would like to stop by (hi!)\n\nWe're eating food in the shower\n\nThis is the pinnacle of your year\n\nThe night is only getting better as we get wetter and wetter\n\nHey is this mayo or conditioner? I have no idea\n\n\n\nMan, it's getting crowded in here. Let's towel off\n\nOh God, the Mariachi band! (senor!)"
