  "lyrics": "Woman left me with the blues\r\nAnd I know just how I got 'em\r\nI see a fifth of Jimmy Beam\r\nI'm gonna drink it to the bottom\r\nI ain't tryna hurt nobody\r\nI ain't prone to give a damn\n\nI got me nothin' left to lose\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood\n\n\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood\n\nThat's where I'll be all night\n\nIf anybody's lookin' for me\n\nLook for a neon light, oh\n\nI'm playin' here tonight\n\nAnd then I'm playin' here tomorrow\n\nI got a whiskey and a tune\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood\n\n\n\nIf I get to gettin' loud\n\nDon't you worry 'bout it, boys\n\n'Cause gettin' over this heartache\n\nIs gonna make a little noise\n\nIf I start to dancin' 'round\n\nDon't try and pull me off the floor\n\nI'm just a-kickin' up my boots\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood\n\n\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood\n\nThat's where I'll be all night\n\nIf anybody's lookin' for me\n\nLook for a neon light, oh\n\nI'm playin' here tonight\n\nAnd then I'm playin' here tomorrow\n\nI got a whiskey and a tune\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood\n\nI got a whiskey and a tune\n\nI'm in a honky-tonk mood"
