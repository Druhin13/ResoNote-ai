  "lyrics": "When I give these books away will my ink betray me?\r\nWill my stories resist wings and grow feet and convince me that I'm boasting?\r\nOr will my psalms seek the company of lonely breaths?\r\nWill they inspire subtle lovers to kiss with mouths they don't have yet?\r\nBoy, whoever reads about how much I adore you\r\nI hope my words bring them something new, something new\n\n\n\nOoh child bless your heart, keep a tender heart\n\nHeart\n\nHeart\n\n\n\nWith you I can empty myself of all my rivers and become a remarkable sky\n\nHow could I keep these love documents to myself?\n\nHow could I restrict what's given me life?\n\nToday I'll find a kind and burrowing creature that can carry these pages until browned\n\nHe'll recite the details of your love with his family\n\nAnd what was once a whisper will become a deep rumbling sound\n\n\n\nOoh child bless a heart, keep a tender heart\n\n(I'll keep a tender heart)\n\nHeart\n\nHeart\n\nHeart\n\nHeart\n\n(Oh, I'll keep my tender heart)\n\n\n\nBoy thank you for showing me how to be gentle (heart)\n\nI have courage to share your love boldly (heart)\n\n(heart)\n\n(heart)"
