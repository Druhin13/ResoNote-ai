  "lyrics": "You've got your back against the wall\r\nI can see by the way that you hold your head\r\nAnd everything is your fault\r\nWhen everything starts to heat, heat's on you\r\n'Cause you promise not to fall\n\nBefore it grew you said you were\n\nPromise me to call it off\n\nNow I'm feeling things so be sure\n\nPromise me it all be good\n\nBut it is being good to you\n\nCause you promise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\n\n\nSo we finally struck the line\n\nI can see in the darkness there in your eyes\n\nPretending that it's all fine\n\nBut there's another heart eating me, and it's mine\n\n\n\n'Cause you promise not to fall\n\nBefore it grew you said you were\n\nPromise me to call it off\n\nNow I'm feeling things so be sure\n\nPromise me it all be good\n\nBut it is being good to you\n\nCause you promise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nYou promise not to fall\n\n\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you\n\nPromise not to fall\n\nDidn't you, didn't you"
