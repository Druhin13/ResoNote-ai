  "lyrics": "Baby, baby come on down\r\nTo the Voodoo House\r\nVoodoo's alive and well\r\nIn the deep dark south\r\nGraveyard dirt and\r\nThe smell from the witch's brew\n\nI've got a voodoo doll\n\nThat looks just like you\n\n\n\nCome on down\n\nCome on down\n\nI got you your very own room\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\nHey ya! Hey ya! Oh!\n\nHey ya! Hey ya! Oh!\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\n\n\nBaby, I can light you up\n\nAs the night goes dark\n\nI got the gasoline\n\nAnd you got the spark\n\nRaise your skirt and\n\nTake off that pretty white blouse\n\nThere's nobody here but us\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\n\n\nLet it down\n\nLet it down\n\nCrush the floors\n\nShake the walls\n\nOf the Voodoo House\n\n\n\nHey ya! Hey ya! Oh!\n\nHey ya! Hey ya! Oh!\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\n\n\nCome on down\n\nCome on down\n\nI got you your very own room\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\nSex drowned\n\nSpell bound\n\nI'll make your heart go boom\n\nIn the Voodoo House\n\n\n\nEverybody's got something dark they hide\n\nDon't worry, baby\n\nYou know I'm on your side\n\nBring the head of John the Baptist\n\nAnd all his doubts\n\nAnd I'll open up the doors\n\nOf the Voodoo House"
