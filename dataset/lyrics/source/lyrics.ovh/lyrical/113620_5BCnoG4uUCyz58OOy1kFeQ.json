  "lyrics": "The stars in the pavement\r\nAre washed up and jaded\r\nThere's blood on the streets of gold\r\nA beautiful waitress\r\nWho just couldn't make it\r\nSo far away from home\n\n\n\nAre you strong enough? Are you wise enough?\n\nAre you giving up? Will you disappear?\n\nWhen it comes to me, I don't know you see\n\nI don't want to leave, but I can't stay\n\n\n\nI don't know if it's worth it\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\nI don't know if it's worth it\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\nI don't know\n\nI don't know\n\n\n\nNo one can see them\n\nThe angels and demons\n\nAre testing how low you'll go\n\nThe sunsets and sunsets\n\nAs dark as your heart gets\n\nIt's best if you just say no\n\n\n\nBut are you strong enough? Are you wise enough?\n\nAre you giving up? Will you disappear?\n\nWhen it comes to me, I don't know you see\n\nI don't want to leave, but I can't stay\n\n\n\nI don't know if it's worth it\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\nI don't know if it's worth it\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\n\n\nI don't know, if I want it or if I don't\n\nI don't know\n\nI don't know if it's fine now or if it's not\n\n\n\nI don't know if it's worth it\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\nI don't know if it's worth it\n\nIs it worth it? I don't know\n\n\n\nI don't know\n\nI don't know\n\nI don't know"
