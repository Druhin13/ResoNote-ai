  "lyrics": "I can count a million times\r\nPeople asking me how I\r\nCan praise You with all that I've gone through\r\nThe question just amazes me\r\nCan circumstances possibly\n\nChange who I forever am in You\n\n\n\nMaybe since my life was changed\n\nLong before these rainy days\n\nIt's never really ever crossed my mind\n\n\n\nTo turn my back on you oh Lord\n\nMy only shelter from the storms\n\nBut instead I draw closer through these times\n\n\n\nSo I pray\n\n\n\nBring me joy, bring me peace\n\nBring the chance to be free\n\nBring me anything that brings You glory\n\n\n\nAnd I know There'll be days\n\nWhen this life brings me pain\n\nBut if that's what it takes to praise You\n\nJesus Bring the Rain\n\n\n\nI am Yours regardless of\n\nThe dark clouds that may loom above\n\nBecause You are much greater than my pain\n\n\n\nYou who made a way for me\n\nBy suffering Your destiny\n\nSo tell me what's a little rain\n\n\n\nHoly, Holy, Holy\n\nIs the Lord God Almighty"
