Who knows?\n\nI look up to names for help\n\nBut how can our idols save us if they can’t even save themselves\n\nI gotta behave myself\n\nGotta remember my start no I will not betray myself\n\nI been afraid to tell\n\nSo alone so I just braced myself\n\nI’ve wanted love since the age of 12\n\nEven before I could lace myself\n\nThat’s why when I know I lose all that I love that it’s easy to hate myself\n\nIt’s my birthday!\n\nBut I won’t celebrate myself\n\nCause time is gonna take myself\n\nI’m on my proclubs shit, I create myself\n\nBut I’m never gonna rate myself\n\nPicture perfect\n\nIs it worth it\n\nVision blurrin\n\nMissin verses\n\nLife really is a burden\n\nSeeing my face on every sign, I’m a missing person\n\nWhatever he gets, the kid deserves it\n\n\n\nI woke up and my eyes were sore\n\nI gave you every last tear that I had I don’t think I can cry no more\n\nAll of this red on my eyes looking like I never gotten high before\n\nThis is not regular love, this shit is a mile more\n\nI think this is God’s way of reminding me I need to smile more\n\n\n\nLosing time\n\nLemme let you know before I lose my mind yeah\n\nThese days something must be on my side\n\nIf I lose at least I’ll tell you that I tried yeah\n\nThat I tried\n\n\n\nYou’re nothing but a grain of sand in my hourglass\n\nBut I can spot you from a mile away, yeah\n\n\n\nI’m searching for you"
