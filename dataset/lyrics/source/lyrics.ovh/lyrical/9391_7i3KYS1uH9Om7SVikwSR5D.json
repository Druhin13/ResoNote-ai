  "lyrics": "I get scared from the thought\r\nOf someone else having your heart\r\nIt's been a long time and I don't wanna have to restart\r\nI could go somewhere and try to start over again\r\nBut it's not what I want (not what I want)\r\nI don't wanna lose my best friend\n\n\"We're in love,\" is what I say\n\nAnd nobody's perfect anyway\n\nI don't wanna see something that'll change my mind\n\nEverything is cool and we're just fine\n\n\n\nI don't wanna go thru your phone\n\nSome things are better left unknown\n\nI rather keep livin' in my daydream\n\nKeep thinkin' that things are just what they seem\n\n\n\nI'mma look away, if it's sittin' in front of me\n\nI don't wanna catch a case based on what I see\n\nI'm tellin' you that I trust you\n\nAnd if you're doin' dirt I ain't even tryna push you\n\nYou know what they say (say, say)\n\n\"What you don't know won't hurt you\"\n\nWe work too hard to build this life\n\nAnd that won't change over something you type\n\nThere's no need to worry, everything is in line\n\nWe're in this forever at least in my mind\n\n\n\nI don't wanna go thru your phone\n\nSome things are better left unknown\n\nI' rather keep livin' in my daydream\n\nKeep thinkin' that things are just what they seem"
