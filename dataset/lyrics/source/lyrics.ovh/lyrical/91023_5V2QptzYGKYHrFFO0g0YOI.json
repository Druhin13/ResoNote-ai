  "lyrics": "Maybe your granddad kept his dogtags hanging on the rearview\r\nAnd maybe your mama drove you around in a Chevy Nova bright blue\r\nMight've got your 16 first date, yes at a slider in the drivethrough\r\nDown Main Street, she was so cute, ended up just friends\r\nIf it sounds like it could've been you, or it's somewhere you might've been\r\nCan I get a name then\n\n\n\nFor a roman candle sky\n\nA July praying for rain\n\nYeah, sparks out the window, cigarette\n\nWithering silhouette caught in the flames\n\nThe keys to a fix-it-up dream\n\nA love, and a first-crush heart\n\nAnd to not knowing the secrets of life\n\nBut damn sure knowing where it starts\n\nAmen, amen, amen\n\n\n\nAnd maybe you shot some bullet holes through tail of a windmill\n\nStuck a cross in some flowers by the road on the edge of a weed field\n\nAnd maybe that scar on your hands from a midnight parking lot disagreement with one of your buddies\n\nSo you squared off, then you made up\n\nWith a tailgate cold beer apology\n\nJust some memories that'll always be\n\n\n\nIn a roman candle sky\n\nA July praying for rain\n\nYeah, sparks out the window, cigarette\n\nWithering silhouette caught in the flames\n\nThe keys to a fix-it-up dream\n\nA love, and a first-crush heart\n\nAnd to not knowing the secrets of life\n\nBut damn sure knowing where it starts\n\nAmen, amen, amen\n\n\n\nYeah, amen\n\nOoh, amen\n\n\n\nFor a roman candle sky\n\nA July praying for rain\n\nYeah, sparks out the window, cigarette\n\nWithering silhouette caught in the flames\n\nThe keys to a fix-it-up dream\n\nA love, and a first-crush heart\n\nAnd to not knowing the secrets of life\n\nBut damn sure knowing where it starts\n\nAmen, amen, amen\n\nOoh, amen"
