  "lyrics": "Our beating hearts\nDrive us down\nDown to the deepest foundation of life\nIn nature's womb\nCreation's ground, in chaos\nWhere the secret key of the all lies concealed\n\n\n\nBlessed darkness\n\nShadow of earth\n\nLost and abandoned\n\nBy our time\n\nYour secret ground\n\nYour sacred ground\n\nEver reaching down\n\n\n\nWhat is secretly perceived is made clear\n\nMy hand is but a tool of another farther located sphere\n\nThe chthonic spirit's wailing\n\nBeckons from to the other side\n\nFrom the bridge of dark somber realms\n\nTo the world of man\n\n\n\nBlessed darkness\n\nShadow of earth\n\nLost and abandoned\n\nBy our time\n\nYour secret ground\n\nYour sacred ground\n\nEver reaching down"
