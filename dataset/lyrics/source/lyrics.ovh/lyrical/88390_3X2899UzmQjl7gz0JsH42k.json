  "lyrics": "Just a few minutes after taking them I realized\r\nHundreds of buzzing flies were all over me\r\nI looked up and there you were, reading\r\nYou were on your own, you were on vacation\r\nYou were on vacation\n\nVacation means \"leave\"\n\nMeans \"obliterate all prior things\"\n\n\n\nHere, why don't I try\n\nWhy don't I try to make you mine?\n\nWhy is a lack of imagination the crime?\n\nWhy don't I try\n\nWhy don't I try to make you mine?\n\nWhy don't I back you up against this moment?\n\n\n\nSo when you finally go\n\nAnd when you choose to go\n\nI resume my little road\n\nAnd nobody needs to know\n\nWill know that I ever meant to leave\n\nMy little lower road\n\n\n\nI watch the bird feeder out back in my parents' yard\n\nThe weight of that bluejay\n\nThe bully steals it all\n\n\n\nAnd what must happen in your mind\n\nWhen you create those silences?\n\nWell never mind, I don't want to see\n\nI know it's got nothing to do with me\n\n\n\nHere, why don't I try\n\nWhy don't I try to move aside?\n\nI'm still soft, I'm still in my prime\n\nWhy don't I try\n\nWhy don't I try to move aside\n\nI'm still soft, it's still my time\n\n\n\nAnd when you finally go\n\nWhen you choose to go\n\nI resume my little road\n\nAnd nobody needs to know\n\nWill know that I ever meant to meant to leave\n\nMy little lower road\n\n\n\nAnd when you finally go\n\nWhen you choose to go\n\nI resume my little road\n\nAnd nobody needs to know\n\nWill know that I was only holding your place on this\n\nYour little lower road"
