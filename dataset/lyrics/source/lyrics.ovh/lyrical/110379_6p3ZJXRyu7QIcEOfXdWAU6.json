(Damn)\nHad to let my ex go, that boy was nothin' but drama\n\nOnly thing I'm worried 'bout is gettin' into these commas\nLet's take a trip across the water and go to Yokahoma\nIf you act right I could be your lady, if you act right I could have your baby\nPull up in that all blacked out Mercedes, cake by the pound, might be stunin' daily (Yeah)\nBitch wanna have beef, pour the gravy (Yeah)\nMy enemies mad, they love to hate me (Ha)\nSelf made queen, I ain't never been lazy\nOne taste of that cake gon' make you crazy\n\n[Z-Ro]\nWho wanna be boo'd up, hell no, I ain't crazy\nI only met you last night, no I ain't crazy\nTryna get the keys to my house, I ain't crazy\nYou sexier than a bitch, but I'm not that crazy\n\nWe did it last night, must have drove you crazy\nThinkin' we a couple now, ain't that crazy?\nWanna have a baby, do i look that crazy?\nI hope you know now that I'm not that crazy\nNo"
