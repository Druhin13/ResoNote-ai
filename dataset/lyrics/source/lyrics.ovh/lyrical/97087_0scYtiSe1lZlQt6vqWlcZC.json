  "title": "We Deal With the Freak'n (intermission)",
  "lyrics": "It's not about the physical manifestation of Satan. Now we deal with the freakâ€™n. But that's in volume two! First, I'm tryna get the woman to understand the dynamic power and the spiritual energy. Do you realize how magnificent you are? The god that created you is a divine architect that created the moon, the sun, the stars, Jupiter, Mars, Pluto, Venus. We are not only sexual beings, we are the walking embodiment of god consciousness."
