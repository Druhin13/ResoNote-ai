  "lyrics": "My eyes are brown\r\nI spent my whole life lookin' down\r\nDodgin' punches, bounced around\r\nTelling myself I wasn't no count\r\nI'm starting to see things different now\r\nOut of nowhere you showed up\n\nSaid you liked my edges rough\n\nFelt your touch and for the first time\n\nI didn't wanna buck\n\n\n\nI love my eyes 'cause you look into 'em\n\nAnd I love my name 'cause you say it, baby\n\nI love my heart 'cause you stole it\n\nMy kiss 'cause you want it\n\nMy mind 'cause you own it every minute\n\nI love my life 'cause you're in it\n\n\n\nA vagabond just runnin' from my blood\n\nKeeping my back to the sun\n\nWhiskey on my breath, bitter words on my tongue\n\nShowed you the truth, you kissed my scars\n\nAnd the faded faces on my cards\n\nI ain't the man I used to be\n\nBecause of who you are\n\n\n\nI love my eyes 'cause you look into 'em\n\nAnd I love my name 'cause you say it, baby\n\nI love my heart 'cause you stole it\n\nMy kiss 'cause you want it\n\nMy mind 'cause you own it every minute\n\nI love my life 'cause you're in it\n\n\n\nIt's just the begging of\n\nThe beautiful ending love\n\nYour love makes life worth living, worth living\n\n\n\nI love my eyes 'cause you look into 'em\n\nAnd I love my name 'cause you say it, baby\n\nI love my heart 'cause you stole it\n\nMy kiss 'cause you want it\n\nMy mind 'cause you own it every minute\n\nI love my life 'cause you're in it\n\nI love my life 'cause you're in it\n\nOh"
