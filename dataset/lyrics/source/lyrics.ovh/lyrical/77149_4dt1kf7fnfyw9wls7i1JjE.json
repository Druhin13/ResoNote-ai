  "lyrics": "A sell-out is someone who becomes a hypocrite in the name of money\r\nAn idiot is someone who lets their education do all of the thinking\r\nA phony is someone who demands respect for the principles they effect\r\nA dilettante is someone who can't tell the difference between fashion and style\r\nCharisma is exquisite manipulation\n\nAnd money is a sandpit of the soul\n\nMoney is the sandpit of the soul\n\nMoney is the sandpit of the soul\n\nMoney is the sandpit of the soul\n\n\n\nTailored dreams of having it all\n\nShe documents an essence in a bathroom stall\n\nAn empty cheers marks an empty occasion\n\nThe empty glasses is ringing, all across the nation\n\nAll across the nation\n\nAll across the nation\n\nAll across the nation\n\n\n\n\n\nWell the suits are runnin' and it won't be long\n\nUntil the blues cop what's really going on\n\nWell the suits are runnin' and it won't be long\n\nUntil the blues cop what's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on\n\nWhat's really going on"
