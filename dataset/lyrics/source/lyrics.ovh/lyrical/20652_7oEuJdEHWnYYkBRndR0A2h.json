  "lyrics": "I hope you are a dreamer\r\nDust on your knees\r\nGives us one or two whispers\r\nThen give us forty screams\r\nIs this the future\n\nStanding over me?\n\nWill it grow, will it burst, when the flower blooms\n\nOr can it rise from such a seed?\n\n\n\nI can't bear another day like this\n\nI can't bear another day like this\n\nIf I can't bear to see the dark, can you?\n\n\n\nI know just what you're feeling\n\n\n\nSo, throw a rope around the morning\n\nTie it tightly to your chest\n\nAnd while you pull for something bright and something golden\n\nSplit infinity into forty breaths\n\n\n\n'Cause I had wanted a better world for you\n\nI had wanted a better world for you\n\nIf I can't bear to see it through, will you?\n\n\n\nI had wanted a better world for you\n\nI had wanted a better world for you\n\nIf I can't bear to see it through, can you?\n\n\n\nA young ghost in an old body\n\nCaught inbetween the throat and the lungs\n\nSpeak love, speak love, speak\n\nOld ghost in a young body\n\nCaught inbetween the throat and the tongue\n\nScream love, scream love, scream love"
