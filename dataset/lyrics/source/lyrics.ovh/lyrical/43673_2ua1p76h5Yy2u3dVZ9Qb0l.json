  "lyrics": "They say into your early life romance came\r\nAnd in this heart of yours burned a flame\r\nA flame that flickered one day and died away\r\nThen, with disillusion deep in your eyes\r\nYou learned that fools in love soon grow wise\n\nThe years have changed you, somehow\n\nI see you now\n\n\n\nSmoking, drinking, never thinking of tomorrow\n\nNonchalant\n\nDiamonds shining, dancing, dining\n\nWith some man in a restaurant\n\nIs that all you really want?\n\n\n\nNo, Sophisticated Lady, I know\n\nYou miss the love you lost long ago\n\nAnd when nobody is nigh you cry\n\n\n\nIs that all you really want?\n\n\n\nNo, Sophisticated Lady, I know\n\nYou miss the heart you lost long ago\n\nAnd when nobody is nigh you cry"
