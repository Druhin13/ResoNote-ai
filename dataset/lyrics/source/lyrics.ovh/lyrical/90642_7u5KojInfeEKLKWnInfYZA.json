  "lyrics": "So far away from home, beyond a distant reach\r\nFaith whispers from the edge, returning piece by piece\r\nA lonely point of light, captured in a final glance\r\nA solitary hint of life, discovered it by chance\r\nGod creators, dream destroyers\n\nSpineless cowards and fearless warriors\n\nHopeful children, mothers and fathers\n\nOur blood filled river's fueled by hate\n\nWe worship heroes, kings and saints\n\nBut who's out there to save us from ourselves?\n\n\n\nAll you will ever know, all life that ever was\n\nAll you despise or love, living out their lives\n\nThis isolated speck, hurtling through the cosmic dark\n\nWould seem to go astray if we were washed away\n\n\n\nGod creators, dream destroyers\n\nKnowledge seekers and bold explorers\n\nHopeful children, mothers and fathers\n\nOut of this place we call our home\n\nAdrift in space, we're on our own\n\nBut who's out there to save us from ourselves?"
