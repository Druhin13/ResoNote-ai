  "lyrics": "Colors on the wind\r\nFloating from a different world\r\nGreet the dawn\r\nWith a song to welcome the daybreak\r\nIt's a melody, I hear in my memory\n\nWhere I watch birds take flight\n\nOff into the Eastern sky\n\n\n\nNo time to waste\n\nCan we escape\n\nTo the place where the treasure lies\n\nOut here on the seven seas\n\nWe will find our paradise\n\n\n\nCan we be reborn in the wake of the storm\n\nSo that I can tell you the words of my heart\n\nThere is so much I would give to you\n\nBut in one life there is not enough time\n\n\n\nUnderneath the waves there is a melody\n\nTelling our story of faraway lands\n\nI'll sing along so I won't forget\n\nSo through this song\n\nMay the tale live on"
