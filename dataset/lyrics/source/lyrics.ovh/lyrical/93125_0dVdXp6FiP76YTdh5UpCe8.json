  "lyrics": "You niggas might be aight but I'm more goody\r\nThis hip hop shit is a sport to me\r\nI'm Bill [?] in a porch hoodie\r\nPass me the torch, I'm a contortionist\r\nThe way I manoeuvred into this game\r\nThey ain't even opened the door fully\n\nNiggas tough talking, I scorched bullies\n\nLiterally, fuck a metaphor\n\nA blind man can see that my team is ahead of yours\n\nSo I ain't gotta check the score\n\n[?] two crates at the record store\n\nI'm either Heath Ledger or Brandon Lee\n\nSee I can catch a bullet randomly\n\nOr OD on medication and never become the legend I plan to be\n\nIt's a very thin line between genius and insanity\n\nI walk the tight rope\n\nShall I fall? I hope to end it all on the right note\n\nFor this shit that I write bro\n\nI get a check and I don't mean spell checking for typos\n\nThis ain't a essay\n\nI paid the cost to be the [?]\n\nMore work and less play\n\nAnd now a nigga polished\n\nFunny since they kicked me outta college\n\nI been kicking knowledge\n\nFar from consciousness\n\nNigga with a guilty conscience\n\nPart of my mental was built on nonsense\n\nSo I be with the fuck shit\n\nThat's why at every function while all you niggas jumping\n\nI'm in this bitch with my back against the wall\n\nAnd a strap in my draws for niggas yapping they jaws\n\nShorty grabbed me by my hand and said I never dance\n\nThen asked if I'm nervous\n\nI just don't want this shit to fall and pop myself\n\nLike a [?]\n\nYour flow compared to mine is like match to a furnace\n\nSo I pay more in taxes than what you actually earning\n\nFactual learning\n\nI'm the captain of this ship\n\n'Fore I ride a nigga wave, I'll capsize this bitch\n\nAnd yo ass might get drenched\n\nLike a baptising shit\n\nBut ain't no pass, it's just a black guy with a stick\n\nGet jacked riding in a six\n\nCandy pane, got 'em looking like a sweet lick\n\nTo a broke nigga thats a cheap face\n\nMan is a maze to compete with\n\n40 calibre, it ain't your calendar\n\nChallengers lining up for your Challengers or Camero\n\nRide for your dinero\n\nYou better play scarecrow\n\nI hollow tips outta that barrel\n\nRipping through a [?]\n\nI keep it real thorough\n\nLet you niggas play Will Ferrel\n\nI'm a wheel barrow\n\nPush through the ales and perils to see if the grass is greener\n\nNiggas still gotta stash the nina\n\nMe and tick passing weed and mashing through Pasadena\n\nOff the lit\n\nI'm surprised we ain't crashed the Beamer\n\nPardon my brash demeanour\n\nThe freshman to the outclass, the class of seniors\n\nAnd they ain't even a masters genius\n\nWest mile just a mast of demons\n\nStrike game to the casket\n\nWe'll never let the cash between us, uh"
