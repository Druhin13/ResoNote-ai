  "lyrics": "The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves\r\nLike a vision she dances across the porch. As the radio plays\r\nRoy Orbison singing for the lonely\r\nHey that's me and I want you only\r\nDon't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again\r\nDon't run back inside, darling you know just what I'm here for\n\nSo you're scared and you're thinking\n\nThat maybe we ain't that young anymore\n\nShow a little faith, there's magic in the night\n\nYou ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright\n\nOh and that's alright with me \n\nYou can hide `neath your covers and study your pain\n\nMake crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain\n\nWaste your summer praying in vain\n\nFor a saviour to rise from these streets\n\nWell now I'm no hero, that's understood\n\nAll the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood\n\nWith a chance to make it good somehow\n\nHey what else can we do now?\n\nExcept roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair\n\nWell the night's busting open\n\nThis two lanes will take us anywhere\n\nWe got one last chance to make it real\n\nTo trade in these wings on some wheels\n\nClimb in back, Heaven's waiting on down the tracks\n\n\n\nOh-oh come take my hand\n\nWe're riding out tonight to case the promised land\n\nOh-oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road,\n\nLying out there like a killer in the sun\n\nHey I know it's late we can make it if we run\n\nOh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold, Thunder Road\n\n\n\nWell I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk\n\nAnd my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk\n\nFrom your front porch to my front seat\n\nThe door's open but the ride it ain't free\n\nAnd I know you're lonely and there's words that I ain't spoken\n\nBut tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken\n\nThere were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away\n\nThey haunt this dusty beach road\n\nIn the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets\n\nThey scream your name at night in the street\n\nYour graduation gown lies in rags at their feet\n\nAnd in the lonely cool before dawn\n\nyou hear their engines roaring on\n\nBut when you get to the porch they're gone\n\nOn the wind, so Mary climb in\n\nIt's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win."
