  "lyrics": "Lately I’ve been feeling so strange\r\nWake up dreaming of cheap love and aeroplanes\r\nI could never take what I needed\r\nOur moments of pleasure were fleeting\r\nAnd lately I’ve been feeling so cruel\r\nThis weak plastic portrait painted of you\n\nI could never draw out a meaning\n\nNothing more than a dishonest feeling\n\n\n\nBut you know it’s not in me tonight\n\nNo words, nothing in sight\n\n\n\nAnd lately I’ve been feeling so restless\n\nI drove to a small town last weekend just to see where my head is\n\nIt’s not here\n\nAll I found was a lounge with a jazz singer\n\n“Blue Velvet”\n\nBut how high do we need to get before we see\n\nWe’re stuck on the ground?\n\nI’ve been saving money\n\nFor a greyhound ticket\n\nAnd I swear I’ll be getting out soon\n\nYou know I love you\n\n\n\nBut you know it’s not in me tonight\n\nNo words, nothing in sight\n\nAnd you know it's not in me tonight\n\nNo words, nothing in sight\n\n\n\nThen I broke down\n\nLost my keys but found my wallet on the nightstand\n\nSpent the night in someone else’s bed\n\nI can’t stand\n\nSpending nights away from home\n\nBut that’s all that I’ve been doing\n\nIt's all that I’ve been doing\n\nThen I woke up\n\nWith the city on my mind\n\nI can’t keep up with my mind\n\nIt’s always rushing to the next love\n\nBut when I return I swear it will not be as a tourist\n\nWill not be as a tourist\n\n\n\nBut you know it’s not in me tonight\n\nNo words, nothing in sight"
