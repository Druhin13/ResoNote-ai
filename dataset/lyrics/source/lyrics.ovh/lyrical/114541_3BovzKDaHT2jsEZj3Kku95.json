  "lyrics": "I hold you in my arms \nAs the band plays \nWhat are those words whispered baby \nJust as you turn away \nI saw you last night \nOut on the edge of town \n\nI wanna read your mind \n\nTo know just what I've got in \n\nThis new thing I've found \n\nSo tell me what I see \n\nWhen I look in your eyes \n\nIs that you baby \n\nOr just a brilliant disguise \n\n\n\nI heard somebody call your name \n\nFrom underneath our willow \n\nI saw something tucked in shame \n\nUnderneath your pillow \n\nWell I've tried so hard baby \n\nBut I just can't see \n\nWhat a woman like you \n\nIs doing with me \n\nSo tell me who I see \n\nWhen I look in your eyes \n\nIs that you baby \n\nOr just a brilliant disguise \n\n\n\nNow look at me baby \n\nStruggling to do everything right \n\nAnd then it all falls apart \n\nWhen out go the lights \n\nI'm just a lonely pilgrim \n\nI walk this world in wealth \n\nI wanna if it's you I don't trust \n\n'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself \n\n\n\nNow you play the loving woman \n\nI'll play the faithful man \n\nBut just don't look too close \n\nInto the palm of my hand \n\nWe stood at the altar \n\nThe gypsy swore our future was right \n\nBut come the wee wee hours \n\nWell maybe baby the gypsy lied \n\nSo when you look at me \n\nYou better look hard and look twice \n\nIs that me baby \n\nOr just a brilliant duisguise \n\n\n\nTonight our bed is cold \n\nI'm lost in the darkness of our love \n\nGod have mercy on the man \n\nWho doubts what he's sure of"
