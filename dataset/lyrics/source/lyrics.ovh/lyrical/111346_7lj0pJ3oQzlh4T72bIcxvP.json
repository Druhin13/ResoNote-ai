  "lyrics": "I'd sing the harmonies and Dixie sang the melody\r\nAnd we sing a little off key sometimes\r\nBut we had some fun, son of a gun\r\nI wonder if I ever even cross her mind\r\nThen she ran away with Billy Bovine\n\nHe was a flat top guitar pickin' friend o' mine\n\nAnd now I'm just sittin' home just countin' the stars\n\nI got close but no guitar\n\n\n\nI got close but no guitar\n\nShe was a shooting star\n\nWho ran off with a guitar pickin' friend o' mine\n\nShe's really on her way\n\nI hear her records every day\n\nI got close but no guitar\n\n\n\nI still play piano bars, still drive that same ol' car\n\nI live in that little shack in Tupelo\n\nDixie is the queen of Billboard Magazine\n\nPlayin' 'cross the country doin' one night shows\n\n\n\nA man walks up with a dollar in his hand\n\nSays let me hear the song by Dixie and the guitar man\n\nAnd as the dollar falls to the bottom of my jar\n\nI get close but no guitar\n\n\n\nI got close but no guitar\n\nShe was a shooting star\n\nWho ran off with a guitar pickin' friend o' mine\n\nShe's really on her way\n\nI hear her records every day\n\nI got close but no guitar\n\n\n\nI got close but no guitar\n\nShe was a shooting star\n\nWho ran off with a guitar pickin' friend o' mine\n\nShe's really on her way\n\nI hear her records every day\n\nI got close but no guitar"
