  "lyrics": "Like a pervert on a crowded bus\r\nA glare of love bears down on us\r\nLike a carcass left out in the heat\r\nThis love is bursting out of me\r\nDisappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all\n\nAnd a love that lasts forever really can't be that special\n\nSure we know our roles, and how it's supposed to go\n\nDoes everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?\n\n\n\nLike an oil tanker tipped at sea\n\nThis love's contaminated me\n\nLike a constant twitching in my eye\n\nThis love of ours will never die\n\n\n\nDisappointing diamonds are the rarest of them all\n\nAnd a love that lasts forever really can't be that special\n\nSure we know our roles, how it's supposed to go\n\nDoes everybody have to be the greatest story ever told?"
