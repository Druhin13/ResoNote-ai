  "lyrics": "Darkening skies, coming this way\r\nFalling behind, into nothing\r\nIf you lead, I will follow\r\nA thousand miles away\r\nI will be, your Apollo\n\nAlone in outer space\n\n\n\nSatellite, shine on me tonight\n\nI'll feel your gravity, I'll stay and never leave\n\nMy satellite, I'm here tonight\n\nShine your light and set me free\n\nTake the darkness out of me\n\nShine on me\n\n\n\nShine on me\n\n\n\nBlinded I wait, end if forming\n\nYou are my fate, give me warning\n\n\n\nIf you lead, I will follow\n\nA thousand miles away\n\nI will be, your Apollo\n\nAlone in ouÂ—\n\n\n\nSatellite, shine on me tonight\n\nI'll feel your gravity, I'll stay and never leave\n\nMy satellite, I'm here tonight\n\nShine your light and set me free\n\nTake the darkness out of me\n\nShine on me\n\n\n\nShine on me\n\n\n\nFall across the emptiness, and walk the night\n\nDeserves the silence in the dark, and left behind\n\nI seek the stars above the world to be the guide\n\nThey are pale against the light in your eyes\n\n\n\nIn your eyes...\n\n\n\nAnd once I pass I know that you are too late\n\nBut I can feel you coursing through beyond the space\n\nJust send your energy to me and I'll push on\n\nSend your signal out, and bring me back to you\n\n\n\nSatellite, shine on me tonight\n\nI'll feel your gravity, I'll stay and never leave\n\nMy satellite, I'm here tonight\n\nShine your light and set me free\n\nTake the darkness out of me\n\nShine on me\n\n\n\nShine on me"
