  "lyrics": "I overheard you and your girlfriend talking \nProblems with your man's infidelity \nThe same thing happened to me and my lady \nSo I left you with my card anonymously \n[Chorus:]\n\nCall me, if you will, call me \n\nCause I know how you feel, call me \n\nFax me, baby here's my number \n\neight two five four two sixty three, just call me \n\n\n\nSo you made up your mind to make this visit \n\nCheckin' up on people is my business \n\nYou needed confirmation for suspicion \n\nThat left you crying over a thousand minutes \n\nNow suddenly I feel the plot thickening \n\nI find myself having to atone \n\nThis situation has my mind just spinning \n\nCause now I really want you for my own, my own \n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n\n\nSassy scatting (go head Stokley!) \n\n\n\n[Chorus: w/Adlib to end]"
