  "lyrics": "Nothing will ever be the same. Laid to waste all emotion. Forget my name. Empty words that’s all you fucking meant. A million miles of separation. Set me free. Set me free. Embrace the flames of this sacrifice. Set me free. Out of the darkness to seek the light. Set me free. Set me free\r\nNow broken hope and warning signs\r\nSearching just to be abused. Die among who\r\nFucking hide. Liars words. All you fucking meant. A million miles of separation\r\nSet me free.Set me free\r\nEmbrace the flames of this sacrifice\n\nSet me free. Out of the darkness to seek the light. Set me free. Nothing will ever be the same. Laid to waste all emotion. Forget my name\n\nEmpty words that’s all you fucking meant\n\nA million miles of separation\n\nSet me free. Set me free\n\nEmbrace the flames of this sacrifice\n\nSet me free. Out of the darkness to seek the light.Set me free. Set me free.''No one from nowhere\n\nI am the liar will you listen to me? I am the addict will you fill my need? I am Oblivion now follow me. Now follow me. My mind is destruction. Leaving me now chance to ever be free\n\nExcuse for depression. A death on my reality\n\nI am love. I am hate. I am the end of my life\n\nI degrade, destroy, I am what I despise. No one. From nowhere. No one ever gave a shit\n\nMy mind the only true enemy. No one from nothing. These moments only contradict\n\nNow times the revenge that I seek\n\nMy soul is degraded. I want to feel but my thoughts won't let me believe. Face down in the pavement I am the house of stone and I am ready to bleed. From nowhere. No one ever gave a shit. My mind the only true enemy.No one from nothing. These moments only contradict\n\nNow times the revenge that I seek"
