  "lyrics": "The sun keeps calling\r\nAnd I've been chasing early\r\nSo give me the coffee in the morning\r\nA kiss when she leaves me\r\nTo get my day started\r\nSo I breathe in life *sniff*\n\nAnd get to another rhythm and I'm in the flow\n\nSitting in the backline, waiting for the perfect one\n\n\n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me \n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me\n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me\n\n\n\nMaybe I've been stallin'\n\nBaby I just won't curve it\n\nJust to keep it in your pocket\n\nKisses when she needs me\n\nLoving and a locket\n\n\n\nI want to be water\n\nSkipping rocks in my soul again\n\nPebbles on Long Beach, slowly turning into sand\n\n\n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me \n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me\n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me\n\n\n\nAnd the waves they, wash over me\n\nCause the riptide pulls me out into the deep\n\nIt surrounds me, holds me, follows when I breath\n\nBut the air is clear and I am here\n\n\n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me \n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me \n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me\n\nAnd the waves came, washed over me"
