  "lyrics": "You'd think that was an artist in my head\r\nShe's drawing in the darkness, I see red\r\nEvery emotion that I do not need suddenly running through me\r\nI never meant to start this, I swear\r\nI'm my own worst enemy\n\nStealing sleep, spinning out of control\n\nAll my memories turn on me\n\nI can hear them all\n\n\n\nI think I think too much\n\nIt's all I know how to do\n\nI think I'm losing touch with what I knew\n\nI've been trying to turn it off\n\nI can never seem to stop\n\nI think I think too much\n\nI think I think\n\nI think I think too much\n\nI think I think\n\n\n\nYou never know I'm like this, no no\n\nI always learn to hide it, never show\n\nThat inside my brain, there's a war going on\n\nExplosions that I can't ignore\n\nThere's no point trying to fight it, I know\n\n\n\nI'm my own worst enemy\n\nStealing sleep, spinning out of control\n\nAll my memories turn on me\n\nI can hear them all\n\n\n\nI think I think too much\n\nIt's all I know how to do\n\nI think I'm losing touch with what I knew\n\nI've been trying to turn it off\n\nI can never seem to stop\n\nI think I think too much\n\nI think I think\n\n\n\nTakes over me like a thief in the night\n\nCan't fight it no matter how much I try\n\n\n\nI think I think too much\n\nIt's all I know how to do\n\nI think I'm losing touch with what I knew\n\nI've been trying to turn it off\n\nI can never seem to stop\n\nI think I think too much\n\nI think I think\n\nI think I think too much\n\nI think I think\n\nI think I think too much\n\nI think I think"
