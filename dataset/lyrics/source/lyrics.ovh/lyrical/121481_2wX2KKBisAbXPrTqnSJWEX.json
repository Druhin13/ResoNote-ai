  "lyrics": "Well my mama told me: son you better watch out\r\nAll those nasty woman gonna rip you dime for dime\r\nBut I got my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode\r\nAnd the story keep on rollin', out from a sad man's tongue\r\nLeft my mama and papa's nest\n\nI got the fever rambling my bones\n\nPapa said: my boy, take my Johnny Cash vinyls and go\n\nWell I got my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode\n\nAnd the story keep on rollin', out from a sad man's tongue\n\n\n\nStrollin' down the highway with uncle Sam roaring: rebel kid get your ass home\n\nYour ass belongs to me\n\nLeave your Johnny Cash songs and get home\n\nBut I got my pocket full of real tales, and a broken guitar mode\n\nAnd the story keep on rollin', out from a sad man's tongue\n\n\n\nSinging in the cell 1.40.9.5\n\nNo way should I wear guns, I'm sitting my time\n\n\n\nLeft 1.40.9.5 with plenty rock'n'roll songs painting the road\n\nEducation sucks, so I sing my song for you\n\n\n\nAnd I got my pocket full of real tales\n\nAnd a broken guitar mode\n\nAnd the story keep on rollin' out from a glad man's tongue"
