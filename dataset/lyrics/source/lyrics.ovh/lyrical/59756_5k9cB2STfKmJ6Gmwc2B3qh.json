  "title": "I Get A Kick Out Of You",
  "lyrics": "My story is much to sad to be told\rBut practically everything leaves me totally cold\rThe only exception I know is the case\rWhen I'm out on a quiet spree, fighting vainly the old ennui\rAnd I suddenly turn and see\rYour fabulous face\rChorus:\rI get no kick from champagne\rMere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all\rSo tell me why should it be true\rThat I get a kick out of you\rSome get a kick from cocaine\rI'm sure that if I took even one sniff\rThat would bore me terrifically too\rBut I get a kick out of you\rI get a kick every time I see you standing there before me\rI get a kick though it's clear to see, you obviously don't adore me\rI get no kick in a plane\rFlying too high with some guy in the sky\rIs my idea of nothing to do\rBut I get a kick out of you\r(repeat)\rI get a kick out of you."
