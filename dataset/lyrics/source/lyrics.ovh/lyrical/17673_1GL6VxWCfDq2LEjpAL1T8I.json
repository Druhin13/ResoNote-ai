  "lyrics": "(I believe, I believe)\r\n...\r\nEverything I own is everything I own\r\nIf it's only dull can I keep my soul\r\nYo I don't even know, I struggle just to cope\n\nHanging by a thread and you hang a rope\n\n\n\nI'm more than just the numbers on the paycheck\n\nWorking hard on pay just to live less\n\nOh my God I'm waiting for the recess\n\nGive me strength to change my life, I need this\n\nI need this\n\n\n\n'Cause I believe I'll be free\n\nOne day I'll be free\n\nMaybe I'm skulking\n\nThat good shit\n\nI believe I'll be free\n\nOne day I'll be free\n\nNo matter what time\n\nThe present ain't need my mind\n\n\n\nMama always said just enjoy the ride\n\nThe grass ain't always greener on the other side\n\nWell...\n\nWell I don't got no crowd, these concrete jungle bars\n\nAnd I don't see no grass unless I'm smoking it\n\n\n\nTakes more than just the numbers on the paycheck\n\nWorking hard on pay just to live less\n\nOh my God I'm waiting for the recess\n\nGive me strength to change the things, I need this\n\nI need this\n\n\n\n'Cause I believe I'll be free\n\nOne day I'll be free\n\nMaybe I'm skulking\n\nThat good shit\n\nI believe I'll be free\n\nOne day I'll be free\n\nNo matter what time\n\nThe present ain't need my mind\n\n\n\nSave me, save me\n\nNo matter how hard they try\n\nI keep my head high"
