  "lyrics": "I remember how we used to be free\r\nListen to nothing but our feelings\r\nWalked to the sound of our own drums beating\r\nWe locked ourselves away and tied up the beast\r\nBut we're only waiting for the moment to break free\n\n\n\nCan you hear my heart howl at the sky?\n\nIt's the wolf that I keep deep inside\n\nI've been holding her back but tonight\n\nTonight we run wild\n\n\n\nTonight we run wild\n\nTonight we run wild\n\nTonight we run wild\n\nTonight we run wild\n\n\n\nThere is no denying what we're made of\n\nSee how your eyes reflect the moonlight\n\nFeel how your instincts come back to life\n\n\n\nCause you can try your best to keep it locked down\n\nBut it's only waiting for the moment to break out\n\n\n\nCan you hear my heart howl at the sky?\n\nIt's a wolf that I keep deep inside\n\nI've been holding her back but tonight\n\nTonight we run wild\n\nCan you hear my heart howl at the sky?\n\nIt's a wolf that I keep deep inside\n\nI've been holding her back but tonight\n\nTonight we run wild\n\n\n\nTonight we run wild\n\nTonight we run wild\n\nTonight we run wild"
