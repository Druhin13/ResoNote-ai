  "lyrics": "We being on the stars was a dream there waiting for a dreamer to dream her\r\nBarely just a spark in the open darkness of the [?] the world beneath her\r\nI never could imagine how my life would change the day it came\r\nAnd how all my fears and worries would just wash away\n\nI never saw it coming and one day all of a sudden\n\nThere was you, you, you, you\n\nI don't have to live without you anymore\n\n\n\nHow could it be so that a heartless fool could burst wide open be reawoken\n\nLittle did I know what a simple thought could set emotion a drop in the ocean\n\n\n\nI've never seen the flowers or the sky so blue is so brand new\n\nLike the sun on the horizon coming into view\n\n\n\nSpend my whole life running then one day all of a sudden\n\nThere was you you you you\n\nThere was you you you you\n\nI don't have to live without you anymore\n\n\n\nI never saw it coming that one day all of a sudden\n\nThere was you you you you\n\nThere was you you you you\n\nI don't have to live without you anymore\n\n\n\nI don't have to live without you anymore"
