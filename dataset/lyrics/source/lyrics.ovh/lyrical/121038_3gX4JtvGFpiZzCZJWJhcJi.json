  "lyrics": "Well I was going down on my lines\r\nAnd I heard that the waiting feel was fine\r\nBut I was reading in between the lies\r\nLike I had my hands right over my eyes\r\nSee, this is what I despise\r\nOf you and I\n\n\n\nI took a trip to the dark side\n\nI placed it on my tongue\n\nRe-wired my whole brain\n\nStarted hell it begun\n\nThe world drained from colour\n\nBlack and white was the sun\n\nI forgot my own name\n\nI forgot who I was\n\n\n\nBut when the big smoke comes\n\nI know the way\n\n'Cause I wanna\n\nGuide your love\n\nGuide your love back home\n\n'Cause when the big smoke comes\n\nI know the way\n\n'Cause I wanna guide your love\n\nBack home"
