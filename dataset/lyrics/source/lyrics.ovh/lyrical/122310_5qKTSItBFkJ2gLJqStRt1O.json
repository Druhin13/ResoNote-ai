  "lyrics": "Oh my God, what's going on?\r\nThis night got fuckin' weird\r\nDrove so fast my brain got buzzed\r\nAnd now I'm standin' here\r\nMet so many faces that\r\nWill probably forget me\n\nBoy, I bet I look so grown up\n\nShirt tucked in my jeans\n\n\n\nAnd now after it all, I just really wanna call\n\nMy dad, my dad\n\nI feel so broke up, I wanna go home\n\nNo, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home\n\n\n\nWe went dancing on the roof\n\nAnd took some girls uptown\n\nThey started fighting with my friend\n\nAnd I can't find him now\n\nHit some bars, and saw some bras\n\nAnd found a house to sleep\n\nForgot my retainer\n\nCould you not be mad at me?\n\n\n\n'Cause now, after it all, I'm just standing here to call\n\nMy dad, my dad\n\nI feel so broke up, I wanna go home\n\nNo, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home\n\nNo, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home\n\nNo, I feel so broke up, I wanna go home"
