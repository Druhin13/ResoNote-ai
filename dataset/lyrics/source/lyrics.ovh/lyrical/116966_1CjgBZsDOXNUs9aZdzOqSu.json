  "lyrics": "The freedom bell ring when they set a nigga free\r\nI'm flyin’ like an eagle when they let me off the leash\r\nGotta prove everybody wrong lookin' down on me\r\nWhen I'm flyin’ like an eagle\r\nIn the streets where I call home, this is where I wanna be\r\nDo I gotta go to jail so I can find a lil' peace?\n\nCould you be the one I call on, will you answer when you sleep?\n\nCould you be the one I call on?\n\n\n\nI ain't never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck\n\nI'm searchin' for my soul, hope you know where it went\n\nIs it cold like my heart, could it take me where I've never been?\n\nI'm never really happy, smilin' when it’s never meant\n\n\n\nI’ve been searchin' for my soul, my heart\n\nDi yon mo pou mwen kumbayah\n\nI got this money, but it’s nothin' right now\n\n'Cause I'm needin’ somethin'\n\nI'm needin' somethin'\n\nI've been searchin' for my soul, my heart\n\nDi yon mo pou mwen kumbayah\n\nI got this money, but it's nothin' right now\n\n'Cause I'm needin' somethin'\n\n\n\nAll this pain make me sing songs\n\nAin't no love in the sewer that I came from\n\nAin't no love in the sewer that I came in from\n\nI can't say that I don't miss my nigga John John\n\nGot the streets cheerin' for me with they pom-poms\n\nI done ran up all this money, got me nauseous\n\nI done ran up all this money, got me nauseous\n\nI done did so many wrongs, it got me cautious\n\nBut I can't ever tell the time in all these watches\n\nAnd I can never read the mind of all these thotties\n\nBroward County, poppin' Molly, droppin' bodies\n\nI can't lie and say that I don't love you, shawty\n\nYou know that you want me right there, well, you got me\n\nAll this fame got me nauseous\n\nTryna dodge the reaper got me boxed in\n\n\n\nI ain't never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck\n\nI'm searchin' for my soul, hope you know where it went\n\nIs it cold like my heart, could it take me where I've never been?\n\nI'm never really happy, smilin' when it's never meant\n\n\n\nI've been searchin' for my soul, my heart\n\nDi yon mo pou mwen kumbayah\n\nI got this money, but it's nothin' right now\n\n'Cause I'm needin' somethin'\n\nI'm needin' somethin'\n\nI've been searchin' for my soul, my heart\n\nDi yon mo pou mwen kumbayah\n\nI got this money, but it's nothin' right now\n\n'Cause I'm needin' somethin'\n\n'Cause I'm needin' somethin'"
