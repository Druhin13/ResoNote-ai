Even worse than cheating\n\nI'm cold reaking of ice picks, scratch and sticks and closed fists\n\nBrassknuckle steel toe kicks\n\nCrack ribs, punch your lungs, hard weaving\n\nHe's gasping and wheezing for air, his breath he can't catch\n\nHe clinches the shirt on his chest\n\nIn a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed\n\n\n\n(Verse 4: U-God)\n\nFirst things first, I chop your head to your fingertips\n\nButcher knife your torso, chop up your ligaments\n\nMake sure it's legitimate, conceal all my fingerprints\n\nChop, chop your body up quick then get rid of it\n\nA hole in the desert, body bag, just polluted it\n\nYour miss was a snitch too? Shotgun killed the bitch\n\nLeave her in the wilderness, suffocated and scarred up\n\nYour brother want more too, blow his fucking car up\n\n\n\n(Verse 5: Killa Sin)\n\nAnother homocide city, murder mystery efficiently\n\nDelete your fucking history broke bone, missing teeth\n\nThrow bones, it's slippery, brings on the triple beam\n\nAll topped and chopped up, my luck is a Mr. Clean\n\nClorax and vicious steam sterilized the whole scene\n\nPhotograph your death so I can spread it to your whole team\n\nWon't leave a trace of evidence for the case\n\nIt's sinister to finish it, hit with the man with no face\n\n\n\n(Verse 6: Masta Killa)\n\nRed wine and pink pill\n\nUnknowingly that this would be his last meal\n\nCut the voice, made the field, six inch stiletto heel\n\nKept his refills filled\n\nTill he's like the gas, kept him still for the real deal\n\nHitman from Brooklyn, Tommy gun specialist\n\nSo when he pop in\n\nSipped cavasier at the bar then waited til she lit a cigar\n\nThen sprayed\n\nThem shatter wine glass he layed, he never saw it coming\n\n\n\n(Verse 7: Ghostface Killah)\n\nYo, murder one, bullets went fast through the flesh\n\nI cocked the sawed off shotty, put a hole in your chest\n\nBlow your lungs out, I've seen you been smoking for years\n\nYou got no heart, I'll hunt you down like Cape Fear\n\nPush your brains out the back of your head, blow off your hands\n\nLeave your body in a dumpster, head in the trashcan\n\nCell catching scene look clean as a whistle\n\nGhost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle"
