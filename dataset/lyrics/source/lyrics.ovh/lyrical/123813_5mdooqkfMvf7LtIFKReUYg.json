  "lyrics": "How deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?\r\nA good friend told me you've been staying out so late\r\nBe careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful of what it takes\r\nFrom what I've seen so far, the good ones always seems to break\r\nAnd I was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me\n\nAnd I can feel your anger from way across the sea\n\nAnd I was kissing strangers, I was causing such a scene\n\nOh, the heart it had such and image of unimaginable things\n\n\n\nGrab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long\n\nI couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song\n\nAnd I want you so badly but you could be anyone\n\nI couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song\n\n\n\nHold me down, I’m so tired now\n\nAim your arrow at the sky\n\nTake me down, I’m too tired now\n\nLeave me where I lie\n\n\n\nAnd I can tell that I'm in trouble when that music starts to play\n\nIn a city without seasons, it keeps raining in LA\n\nI feel like I'm about to fall, the room begins to sway\n\nAnd I can hear the sirens but I can not walk away\n\n\n\nGrab me by my ankles, I've been flying for too long\n\nI couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song\n\nAnd I want you so badly but you could be anyone\n\nI couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song\n\n\n\nHold me down, I’m so tired now\n\nAim your arrow at the sky\n\nTake me down, I’m too tired now\n\nLeave me where I lie\n\n\n\nI thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight\n\nI thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight\n\nAnd I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight\n\nAnd I thought I was flying but maybe I'm dying tonight\n\n\n\nHold me down, I’m so tired now\n\nAim your arrow at the sky\n\nTake me down, I’m too tired now\n\nLeave me where I lie (Fire)\n\nHold me down, I’m too tired now\n\nAim your arrow at the sky\n\nAnd take me down, I’m too tired now\n\nLeave me where I lie (Fire)"
