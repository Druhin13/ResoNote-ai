  "lyrics": "You never were aware of me since you died certain years before my birth\r\nI'm about your age now, soon to attain the days you lost your vital spark\r\nAlthough you're not my father, I'm nevertheless your daughters' brother\r\nWe will never meet in person and I'll never lay roses, just thorns to your grave\r\nIt was more than three decades ago they found you close to the woods\n\nYour gaunt dead body, held by nothing but this plaited noose\n\nMy sister was with them, 'til today she failed to forget\n\nTo her you will never age, your face will never grow old\n\n\n\nThese days of autumn at least wrecked their lives\n\nAnd in the long run, somehow it too shattered mine\n\nThere's no way anybody will get well again\n\nAnd in no way, anybody will be the same again\n\n\n\nThere is this graveyard far up in the mountains\n\nWe met up there in last winter's coldest night\n\nWhen mom brought you dewy flowers\n\nLike she did in all the years before\n\n\n\nThere's so much death up there\n\nEspecially at night\n\nMaybe that's the reason\n\nIt's the only place I feel home\n\nI can totally get your motives\n\nAs I know of severity too\n\nI was always aware that nothing ends with suicide\n\nI was always aware that people die from sadness\n\n\n\nWe move up to the gallows, straight up to the noose\n\nIn this state of depression there's no time left to loose\n\nSo we pour this tree, this life of reckless dedication\n\nHow couldn't we? Our coffin's shaped by its wood\n\n\n\nI don't know if you care\n\nBut your old cabin still guards the gates to the woods\n\nIt's still watching the mountains grow\n\nWatching all these years passing by\n\nAnd after death almost seized it\n\nWe gave our best to fill it with life\n\nIt still looks the same like back in the old days\n\nAs you'd have left it just last June"
