  "lyrics": "I'm gonna wear my flip-flossing\r\nI'm gonna play some flip-cupping\r\nRock a little bit of hip-hoping, Haggard and Jagger\r\nAnd throw a 20 on a cornhole game\r\nIf I'm lucky yeah I might get laid\r\nThe way that it's going, the keg gon' be floating\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned\n\nWork a little less, play a little more\n\nThat's what this day is for\n\nAnd all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke\n\nWork on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong\n\nWith gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on\n\n\n\nGirl you know you're the life of my party\n\nYou can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi\n\nStir it up as we turn on some Molly\n\nIf you want you can get on Harley\n\nI sit you up on a kitchen sink\n\nStick the pain, umbrella in your drain\n\nThey wat that we're feeling we gon' buy this evening\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned\n\nWork a little less, play a little more\n\nThat's what this day is for\n\nAnd all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke\n\nWork on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong\n\nWith gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned\n\nWork a little less, play a little more\n\nThat's what this day is for\n\nAnd all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke\n\nWork on my lay back, ain't nothin' wrong\n\nWith gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on"
