  "lyrics": "He wasn't really known for breaking the rules\r\nWhen he arrived in the second year of my high school\r\nHe wasn't so much of a twist of fate\r\nAs a short turn up from a Southern state\r\nHe was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat\r\nAlways trying to find himself something sweet\n\nAll that he found was a trouble and me\n\nOr maybe trouble just found him\n\n\n\nIt was hard to hide that his heart had scars\n\nHe would stay up late talking to the stars\n\nPeople tried to blame him for making bad choices\n\nWhen he was only listening to the voices\n\nAnd searching for some kind of deeper truth\n\nBetween the lines and the Bible and living proof\n\nThere's no point now to judge him in vain\n\nIf you haven't been there, you don't know the pain\n\n\n\nHe was a liar, but not a fraud\n\nLiving proof that there was no God\n\nJust the Devil, stiff as a rod\n\nA slave to a sugartooth\n\n\n\nHis life became more than he could take\n\nHe found a bad habit he couldn't break\n\nNothing could tame him and nothing could hold him\n\nHe only took the pills when the doctor told him\n\n\n\nLooking to help for the something sweet\n\nTo make his life feel as incomplete\n\nWhat in the hell are you gonna do\n\nWhen the world has made its mind up about you?\n\n\n\nHe was a liar, but not a fraud\n\nLiving proof that there was no God\n\nJust the Devil, stiff as a rod\n\nA slave to a sugartooth\n\n\n\nHe wanted to be a better man\n\nThen life kicked him down like an old tin can\n\nHe would give you the shirt on his back\n\nIf not for a sugartooth\n\n\n\nThey found him lying on his bed\n\nWith a gun in his hand and a quiet head\n\nHis broken heart, now, is finally gone\n\nBut I know that he had to hurt for too long\n\nTo think he had fought it all on his own\n\nJust to lose the battle and die alone\n\nAfter so many years of feeling the loss\n\nHe finally made his way back home\n\n\n\nAnd I helped put what was left in a box\n\nAnd took it to a place called Jesus Rock\n\nAnd scattered him all over jagged mound\n\nAs a symbol to all that the piece had been found\n\nBut not for a sign is left behind\n\nWith a hand stuck reaching back in time\n\nTo a place in which you can never unwind\n\nI hope he found something so sweet\n\n\n\nHe was a liar, but not a fraud\n\nLiving proof that there was no God\n\nJust the Devil, stiff as a rod\n\nA slave to a sugartooth\n\n\n\nHe wanted to be a better man\n\nBut life kicked him down like an old tin can\n\nHe would give you the shirt on his back\n\nIf not for a sugartooth\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth"
