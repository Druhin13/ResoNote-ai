  "lyrics": "This shirt is old and faded\r\nAll the color's washed away\r\nI've had it now for more damn years\r\nThan I can count anyway\r\nI wear it beneath my jacket\r\nWith the collar turned up high\n\nSo old I should replace it\n\nBut I'm not about to try\n\n\n\nThis shirt's got silver buttons\n\nAnd a place upon the sleeve\n\nWhere I used to set my heart up\n\nRight there anyone could see\n\nThis shirt is the one I wore to every boring high school dance\n\nWhere the boys ignored the girls\n\nAnd we all pretended to like the band\n\n\n\nThis shirt was a pillow for my head\n\nOn a train through Italy\n\nThis shirt was a blanket beneath the love\n\nWe made in Argeles\n\nThis shirt was lost for three whole days\n\nIn a town near Buffalo\n\n'Till I found the locker key\n\nIn a downtown Trailways bus depot\n\n\n\nThis shirt was the one I lent you\n\nAnd when you gave it back\n\nThere was a rip inside the sleeve\n\nWhere you rolled your cigarettes\n\nIt was the place I put my heart\n\nNow look at where you put a tear\n\nI forgave your thoughtlessness\n\nBut not the boy who put it there\n\n\n\nThis shirt was the place your cat\n\nDecided to give birth to five\n\nAnd we stayed up all night watching\n\nAnd we wept when the last one died\n\nThis shirt is just an old faded piece of cotton\n\nShining like the memories\n\nInside those silver buttons\n\n\n\nThis shirt is a grand old relic\n\nWith a grand old history\n\nI wear it now for Sunday chores\n\nCleaning house and raking leaves\n\nI wear it beneath my jacket\n\nWith the collar turned up high\n\nSo old I should replace it\n\nBut I'm not about to try"
