  "lyrics": "I'm going back to the edge of the earth\r\nLooking for an old friend\r\nI didn't know when we said goodbye\r\nThat I wouldn't see you again\r\nI still see your smiling face\r\nIn all the stars of outer space\n\n\n\nHere one moment, gone in a flash\n\nI guess, we all fall \n\nThrough the cracks\n\n\n\nThe river shimmered like a sequin dress\n\nBouncin' off your blue eyes\n\nYou put it on, you started to dance\n\n'Til you turned into the blue sky\n\nI still see it in the summers of my brain\n\nSee it in the rainbows, see it in the rain\n\n\n\nHere one moment, gone in a flash\n\nI guess, we all fall\n\nThrough the cracks\n\n\n\nWhat is on the other side\n\nSun palace in the sky\n\nA perfect paradise\n\nAnother kind of life\n\n\n\nYou know you had such a beautiful brain\n\nBut no one understood you\n\nYou only saw one way to escape\n\nBut I wish you didn't have to\n\nBut through the cracks, a light came shining\n\nLike the biggest, brightest diamond\n\nThrough the cracks, where you dispersed\n\nAnd became a whole universe\n\nI still see it in the stillness of the breeze\n\nSittin' on the stoop down on Elliot Street\n\n\n\nHere one moment, gone in a flash\n\nI guess, we all fall oh yeah, we all fall\n\nOh yeah, we all fall \n\nWe all fall through the cracks\n\nLa la la la la la la la\n\nThrough the cracks\n\nLa la la la la la la la\n\nYeah we all fall\n\nLa la la la la la la la\n\nFall through the cracks"
