I never forgot\n\nAmnesia, don't forget I don't need ya\n\nYou're my favorite creature\n\nFor all time, time, time\n\n\n\nNostalgia, come back, I still want you bad\n\nBeen thinking 'bout our old thing\n\nAll the time, time, time, time\n\nNostalgia, I should pick up my phone and just stalk ya\n\nIt's all just so confusing\n\nAll the time, time, time, time\n\nNostalgia, come back, I still want you bad\n\nBeen thinking 'bout our old thing\n\nAll the time, time, time, time\n\nNostalgia, I should pick up my phone and just stalk ya\n\nIt's all just so confusing\n\nAll the time, time, time, time"
