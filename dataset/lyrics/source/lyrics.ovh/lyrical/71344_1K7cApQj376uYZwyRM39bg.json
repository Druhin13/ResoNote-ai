I'm watching all your walls come down\n\nBut he don't know you the way he pretends to\n\nHe's just a cameo, won't be there when you call\n\nNo he don't see you at all, ooh\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nWhen it gets tough\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nTo give you what you need\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nIs his love enough, is he everything you need\n\nThe way I used to be\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nThere for you\n\nThere for you\n\nGonna be everything you need\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nThere for you\n\nThere for you\n\nGonna be everything you need\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be...\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there when the music stop\n\nWho's gonna be there when you're down to lift you up\n\nAre you sure, are you sure that his love's strong enough\n\nWasn't my love strong, strong enough\n\nWasn't my love strong enough\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there when the music stop\n\nWho's gonna be there when you're down to lift you up\n\nAre you sure, are you sure that his love's strong enough\n\nWasn't my love strong, strong enough\n\nWasn't my love strong enough\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nWhen it gets tough\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nTo give you what you need\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nIs his love enough, is he everything you need\n\nThe way I used to be\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nThere for you\n\nThere for you\n\nGonna be everything you need\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you\n\nThere for you\n\nThere for you\n\nGonna be everything you need\n\n\n\nWho's gonna be there for you"
