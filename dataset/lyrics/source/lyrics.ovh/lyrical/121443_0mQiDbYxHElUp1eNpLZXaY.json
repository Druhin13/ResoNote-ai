  "lyrics": "So when you gaze at planet earth from outer space\r\nDoes it wipe that stupid look off of your face?\r\nI saw this aura over the battleground states\r\nI lost the money, lost the keys\r\nBut I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase\n\nAnd I've never thought\n\nNot in a million years\n\nThat I'd meet so many lolas\n\n\n\nCan I please have my money back\n\nMy virtual reality mask is stuck on 'Parliament Brawl'\n\nEmergency battery pack just in time for my weekly chat with God on videocall\n\n\n\nBreaking news\n\nThey take the truth\n\nAnd make it fluid\n\nThe trainer's explanation was accepted by the stuart\n\nA montage of the latest ancient ruins\n\nSoundtracked by a chorus of \"you don't know what you're doing\"\n\n\n\nAnd I've never thought\n\nNot in a million years\n\nThat I'd meet so many lolas\n\n\n\nAnd all of my most muscular regrets Explode behind my eyes like American Sports\n\n\n\nOh, and I've never thought\n\nNot in a million years\n\nThat I'd meet so many lolas"
