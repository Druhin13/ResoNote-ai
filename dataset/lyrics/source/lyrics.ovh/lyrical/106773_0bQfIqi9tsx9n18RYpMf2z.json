  "lyrics": "When I get home from work\r\nI'll call up all my friends\r\nAnd we'll go bust up something beautiful we'll have to build again\r\nWhen I get home from work\r\nI'll wrestle off my clothes\n\nAnd leave em right inside the front door\n\n'cause nobody's home to know\n\n\n\nYou see a hammer finds a nail\n\nAnd a freight train needs the rails\n\nAnd I'm doin' what I'm on this earth to do\n\n\n\nAnd I don't think on why I'm here where it hurts\n\nI'm just lucky to have the work\n\nSunday morning I'm too tired to go to church\n\nBut I thank God for the work\n\n\n\nWhen I get my reward my work will all be done\n\nAnd I will sit back in my chair beside the father and the son\n\nNo more holes to fill and no more rocks to break\n\nAnd no more loading boxes on the trucks for someone else's sake\n\n\n\n'Cause a hammer needs a nail\n\nAnd the poor man's up for sale\n\nGuess I'm doin' what I'm on this earth to do\n\n\n\nAnd I don't think on why I'm here where it hurts\n\nI'm just lucky to have the work\n\nAnd every night I dream I'm drowning in the dirt\n\nBut I thank God for the work\n\n\n\nAnd the day will come when I'll find a reason\n\nAnd somebody proud to love a man like me\n\nMy back is numb, my hands are freezing\n\nWhat I'm working for is something more than free\n\n\n\nAnd I don't think on why I'm here where it hurts\n\nI'm just lucky to have the work\n\nSunday morning I'm too tired to go to church\n\nBut I thank God for the work"
