  "lyrics": "Never was an early riser, used to bein' up all-nighter\r\nNever saw the mornin' light quite like I do now\r\nNever said no to a party, never started savin' money\r\nBut everything is different since you've been around\r\nIt's the way you're smilin' at me, it's in the way you hold my hand\n\nIt's the way I've watched you change me from a boy into a man\n\nIt's a million things about you, and I don't know what it is\n\nBut I have never known a love like this\n\n\n\nNever used to get excited to sit here in the silence\n\nHoldin' on to somethin' the way I'm holdin' you\n\nDidn't used to know how fast time walks and runs and flies by\n\nI never thought I'd feel so deeply, but damn, I do\n\n\n\nIt's the way you're smilin' at me, it's in the way you hold my hand\n\nIt's the way I've watched you change me from a boy into a man\n\nIt's a million things about you, and I don't know what it is\n\nBut I have never known a love like this\n\n\n\nIt's funny how everything I dreamed about\n\nStarts to seem so empty without you\n\n\n\nIt's the way you're smilin' at me, it's in the way you hold my hand\n\nIt's the way I've watched you change me from a boy into a man\n\nIt's a million things about you, and I don't know what it is\n\nBut I have never known a love like this\n\nI have never known a love like this"
