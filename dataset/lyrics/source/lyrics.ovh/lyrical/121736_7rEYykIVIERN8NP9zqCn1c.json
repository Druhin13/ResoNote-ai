  "lyrics": "I'm the reason this got started\r\nDevil’s work dearly departed\r\nYou'll never catch me in the light\r\nI'm why you lock your doors at night\r\nCall me evil\r\nCall me satan\n\nI’m in the shadows salivating\n\nJust close your eyes and count to ten\n\nPlay nice, you'll never see me again\n\n\n\nOne last time\n\nWould you open the door\n\nStep into the light\n\nAnd show us your face\n\nOne last time\n\nWould you open the door\n\nStep into the light\n\n\n\nYou'll be silent forever\n\nAlways clutching your heart\n\nYou'll be silent forever\n\nI'll be gone, gone in the dark\n\n\n\nEveryone knows the situation\n\nYou never go to a second location\n\nSomebody should have warned you\n\nNow through clenched teeth and sullied pride\n\nI'll ask you nicely get inside\n\nDon't make a sound\n\nDon't see my face\n\nHell is only a mile away\n\n\n\nOne last time\n\nWould you open the door\n\nStep into the light\n\nAnd show us your face\n\nOne last time\n\nWould you open the door\n\nStep into the light\n\n\n\nYou’ll be silent forever\n\nAlways clutching your heart\n\nYou’ll be silent forever\n\nI'll be gone, gone in the dark\n\n\n\nWhen my work is done\n\nAnd they give me a name\n\nI’ll step in the light and show my face\n\n\n\nThey call me white bat\n\nI kinda like that\n\nThey call me white bat\n\nNext time i breathe\n\nThey call me (white bat)\n\nI am the white bat\n\nNever forget that\n\nI am the white bat\n\nNever forget"
