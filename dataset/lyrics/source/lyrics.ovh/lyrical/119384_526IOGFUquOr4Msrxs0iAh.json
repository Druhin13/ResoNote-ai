I'm just a student of the Terrordome\n\nYou? You just recruitin' for the skull and bones\n\nMe? I do karate on Illuminati\n\nYou can view the body\n\nI'm at a pool party\n\n\n\nHah, yeah\n\nI know you internet hoes been suckin' on a lot of shit\n\nBut don't worry 'bout me, cuz ain't part of they club\n\n\n\nWe gon' chase down the bully, hit his ass with the fullest\n\nChase down the bully hit his ass with the fullest\n\nThen we gon' string his ass up by his nuts with the pulley\n\nString his ass up by his nuts with the pulley\n\n\n\nStay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)\n\nStay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)\n\nStay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)\n\n\n\nStay ready (Stay ready, stay ready, stay ready)"
