  "lyrics": "I'm not acting my age, I've been playing a spade\r\nPlaying it over and over again\r\nI don't wanna feel pain but I want you\r\nOur hands trapped in a wire, I could call you a liar\r\nI get no relief when I call you a name\r\nBut it's hard not to cave when I want to\n\n\n\nNo one ever warns, no one ever warns ya\n\nNo one ever warns, no one ever warns ya\n\nNo one ever warns, no one ever warns ya\n\n\n\nThe sweetest love in life cuts you like a knife\n\nRipping your insides, leaves you paralysed\n\nCan't believe you let it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\nWe could've had the world but you let us burn\n\nLike a curse, can't believe it doesn't hurt\n\nFor you to just let it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\n\n\nLike sand inside of Vaseline\n\nThere's friction in the space between\n\nI'm just picking a fight cause I want you\n\nAttached to who we used to be\n\nLike lead balloons that weigh on me\n\nHard to erase what I feel, do I need to?\n\n\n\nNo one ever warns, no one ever warns ya\n\nNo one ever warns, no one ever warns ya\n\nNo one ever warns, no one ever warns you now\n\n\n\nThe sweetest love in life cuts you like a knife\n\nRipping your insides, leaves you paralysed\n\nCan't believe you let it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\nWe could've had the world but you let us burn\n\nLike a curse, can't believe it doesn't hurt\n\nFor you to just let it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\n\n\nThe sweetest love in life cuts you like a knife\n\nRipping your insides, leaves you paralysed\n\nCan't believe you let it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\nWe could've had the world but you let us burn\n\nLike a curse, can't believe it doesn't hurt\n\nYou just let it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\n\n\n(Oh, oh)\n\nLet it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\nLet it slide, let it slide, let it slide\n\n(Oh)"
