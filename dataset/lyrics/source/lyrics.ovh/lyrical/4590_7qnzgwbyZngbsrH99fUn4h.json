  "lyrics": "Wake up in the morning and I'm by myself\r\nSad and so depressed since you left\r\nI hate to think you're smiling with somebody else\r\nAnd I know you'll never love me again\r\nAnd I try and pretend that it's all okay\n\nThat I'm doing better without you\n\nGetting harder and harder every day\n\nBut I'm just trying to make it through\n\n\n\nNeed your love, need your touch\n\nTo keep me going\n\nNeed your lips, tender kiss\n\nI'm so broken\n\n\n\nAnd believe me, I'm trying to let you go\n\nBut I need you to know that it's difficult\n\nAnd it hurts, really hurts\n\nAnd I'm still coping (oh)\n\nI'm still coping (oh)\n\nI'm still coping\n\n\n\nAnd I try and pretend that it's all okay\n\nBut I'm broken, broken\n\nGetting harder and harder with every day\n\nBut I'm coping, I'm coping\n\n\n\nNeed your love, need your touch\n\nTo keep me going\n\nNeed your lips, tender kiss\n\nGirl, I'm so broken\n\n\n\nI, to keep me going\n\nI need it\n\nI'm coping (oh)\n\nStill I'm coping, yeah\n\nIt hurts, and it hurts with you gone, oh (oh)"
