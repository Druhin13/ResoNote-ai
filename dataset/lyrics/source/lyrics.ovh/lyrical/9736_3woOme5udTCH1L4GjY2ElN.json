  "lyrics": "People hide your eyes\r\nEverything's recording\r\nAnd one day you're recalling\r\nThe writing on the wall is everything's recorded\r\nLooking through my grey lens\r\nI wonder where this clear is\n\nI try to find what I've already found\n\n\n\nAnd I was going through every single moment\n\nRight down to tie my shoelaces\n\nTo the first time we said grace\n\nAnd how we flew together\n\nAnd how can you know me better\n\nThan anyone, than anyone?\n\n\n\nBecause everything's recorded\n\nAnd nothing is distorted\n\nDeep beneath the surface\n\nDo you know what your worth is?\n\nBeause everything's recorded\n\nAnd nothing is distorted\n\nDeep beneath the surface\n\nYour apathy is worthless\n\n\n\nThere's a circuitry of mine\n\nRecording all the time\n\nAnd right before your time\n\nI feel pleasure realign\n\n\n\n'Cause nothing is distorted\n\nYou were beautiful just as you are\n\nYou were beautiful just as you are\n\n'Cause nothing is distorted\n\nYou were beautiful just as you are\n\nYou were beautiful just as you are\n\n\n\nBecause everything's recorded\n\nAnd nothing is distorted\n\nDeep beneath the surface\n\nDo you know what your worth is?\n\nBecause everything's recorded\n\nAnd nothing is distorted\n\nDeep beneath the surface\n\nYour apathy is, your apathy is worthless\n\nNo, no, no\n\n\n\nAnd how you knew me better\n\nThan anyone, than anyone\n\nAnd how you knew me better\n\nThan anyone, than anyone\n\n\n\nI don't have to worry\n\nThere'll come a time when I'm in love with you\n\nThere'll be a time when you seek the glory\n\nAnd everything before me"
