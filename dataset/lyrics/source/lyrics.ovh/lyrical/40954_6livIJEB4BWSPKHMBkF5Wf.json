  "lyrics": "Lost in a valley of smoke, \nI lose sight of those I love. I cant live in this\r\ndream, wandering the world, a lost soul. \nA shell of a man, frozen in a toxic trance.\r\nUnfamiliar reflection stare at me, \nthese eye are not my own. \n\n\n\nRunning from my demons in this endless valley. \n\nShow me the way\n\nbecause I no longer know right from wrong. \n\nI know what has to be done, \n\nthe smoke will settle the demons will come \n\nand I will be torn apart. \n\n\n\nExposing my weakness the world will see, \n\nwhat I never fucking wanted. \n\nAs I stare at your face, soaked in disgrace,\n\nwhat is the price a judgment of life, \n\nI cry out in this dispossession. \n\n\n\nExposing my weakness the world will see \n\nwhat I never, what I never\n\nwhat I never fucking wanted\n\nThey crowd around me, \n\nhere to take their share of my mind. \n\nI can no longer muster the strength \n\nto face them alone, all on my own. \n\n\n\nThey whisper echoes in unknown tongues, \n\nI refuse to absorb their toxic words. \n\nI've forgotten how to love, \n\nsearching behind locked doors in my mind. \n\nCast aside the fear of reality\n\nface the fucking world."
