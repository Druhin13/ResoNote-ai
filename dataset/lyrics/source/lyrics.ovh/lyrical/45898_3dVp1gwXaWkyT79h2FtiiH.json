  "lyrics": "I have myself a silver blade\r\nThe edge is sharp the handle bone\r\nA little thing of silver made\r\nNow it's the only thing I own\r\nOnce I knew a lordling fine\r\nI heard him whistle as he rode\n\nAnd I was bold to call him mine\n\nThe shoes upon his horse were gold\n\n\n\nOne look in my eyes and he\n\nBid me climb onto his horse\n\nHe asked if I'd his lady be\n\nAnd go away forever more\n\nHe spoke of love songs in each kiss\n\nAnd I who was a young girl then\n\nWas promised every young girl's bliss\n\nGot up and rode away with him\n\n\n\nHe led me to his castle tall\n\nWith promises and jewels until\n\nHe led me through his castle hall\n\nThen took my clothes and worked his will\n\nAnd when he had and I lay there\n\nFrom my head with a silver blade\n\nHe cut a lock of coal black hair\n\nAnd bid me dress and go my way\n\n\n\nBut I marked well the silver blade\n\nAnd where he set it when he did\n\nAnd when his back was turned I laid\n\nIt buried deep beneath his ribs\n\nI used my dagger as a spade\n\nWhere the thorns and lilacs grow\n\nCut the ground into a grave\n\nIn a place even God don't know\n\n\n\nAnd every evening I returned\n\nTo the place for him I'd chose\n\nUntil his skin had turned to worms\n\nWild dogs scattered his bones\n\nAnd all I have of what I was\n\nIs the memory of a maid\n\nWho mistook a thief for love\n\nBut who gained a silver blade"
