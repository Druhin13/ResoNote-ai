  "lyrics": "I saw you throw your hands in the air and say a prayer\r\nYour eyes closed, your nose breathing in the salty air\r\nThere was nothing you could do to make me love you anymore\r\nYou said, \"What I despair in you\r\nI don't feel like I'm going anywhere with you\r\nI might as well fling myself into your ocean\n\nAt least then I'll would be with you!\"\n\n\n\nAnd the ocean roared\n\nAnd the ocean howled\n\nAnd the ocean roared\n\nAnd the ocean howled\n\n\n\nSo you jumped down from the cliff you climbed to\n\nInto paradise that lay below you\n\nI could only stare\n\nAnd let my tears fall into the ocean\n\n\n\nAnd the ocean roared\n\nAnd the ocean howled\n\nAnd the ocean roared\n\nAnd the ocean howled\n\n\n\nAnd the ocean roared\n\nAnd the ocean howled\n\nAnd the ocean roared\n\nAnd the ocean howled"
