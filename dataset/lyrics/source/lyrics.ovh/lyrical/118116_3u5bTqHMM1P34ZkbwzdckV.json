  "lyrics": "Stick, stick to your stones cause that's all you know\r\nI was caught in the middle\r\nI swallow my words down to the bone\r\nCause nothing's that simple\r\nLate at night you pour it out\n\nKnow that only brings you down\n\n\n\nBut go ahead give me all the blame\n\nTwist my words and set them to flame, woah\n\nWe all know\n\nThat you'll go tell all of your friends\n\nThat I'm the one you wish you never met\n\nAnd woah\n\nWe all know\n\n\n\nThe story never ends, ends\n\nThe story never ends, ends\n\n\n\nWound me like a toy spinning too fast\n\nIn every direction\n\nHow, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?\n\n\n\nLate at night you pour it out\n\nKnow that only brings you down\n\n\n\nBut go ahead give me all the blame\n\nTwist my words and set them to flame, woah\n\nWe all know\n\nThat you'll go tell all of your friends\n\nThat I'm the one you wish you never met\n\nAnd woah\n\nWe all know\n\n\n\nThe story never ends, ends\n\nThe story never ends, ends\n\n\n\nThat's who you are\n\nCrash the car\n\nAnd blame the road\n\n\n\nNever your fault\n\nAfter all\n\nI would know\n\n\n\nThe story never ends\n\n\n\nThe story never ends, ends\n\nThe story never ends, ends\n\n\n\nThe story...\n\nThe story...\n\nThe story...\n\nThe story..."
