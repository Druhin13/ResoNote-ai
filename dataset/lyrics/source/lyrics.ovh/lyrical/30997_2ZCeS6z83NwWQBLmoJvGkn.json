Give it time, we'll see\n\n'Cause if you let go you might feel something\n\nBaby, believe me, you're completely wrapped in my love\n\n\n\nSo, we can be more than friends\n\nI just want one more touch\n\nBefore I'm over touching your thighs again\n\n'Cause we left this club in no rush\n\nYou call this love, you call my bluff\n\n\n\nAt first you said you're lyin' but you love it, ma\n\nDon't have any time with any others, nah\n\nYou just wanna be you\n\nAnd that's exactly how it should be\n\nDon't know with me\n\n'Cause this ain't no ordinary love\n\n\n\nI wanna be with you but just for tonight\n\nAnd I wanna get crazy so close your eyes\n\nGettin' off in your mind, we're just wastin' time\n\n'Cause I just wanna love you"
