  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Missing U par Robyn\r\nBaby, it's so real to me\nNow that it's over\nThe space where you used to be\nYour head on my shoulder\nAll of the plans we made\nThat never happened\nNow your scent on my pillow's faded\nAt least you left me with something\n\nThere's this empty space you left behind\nNow you're not here with me\nI keep digging through our waste of time\nBut the picture's incomplete\nThere's this empty space you left behind\nNow you're not here with me\nI keep digging through our waste of time\n\nBut the picture's incomplete\n'Cause I'm missing you\nI miss you\n\nCan't make sense of all of the pieces\nOf my own delusions\nCan't take all these memories\nDon't know how to use â€˜em\nThere's a slick washed up onto the beach\nI follow the traces\nFinding clues in my pockets and opening boxes\nAnd going places we went\nRemember to forget\nThinking how it could been\nI've turned all my sorrow into glass\nIt don't leave no shadow\n\nThere's this empty space you left behind\n\nNow you're not here with me\nI keep digging through our waste of time\nBut the picture's incomplete\nThere's this empty space you left behind\nNow you're not here with me\nI keep digging through our waste of time\nBut the picture's incomplete\n'Cause I'm missing you\nI miss you\n\n(I miss you)\nThis part of you, this clock that stopped\nThis residue, it's all I've got\n(I miss you)\nThis part of you, this clock that stopped\n(Clock that stopped)\nThis residue (It's all I got)\nIt's all I've got\n\n\nThere's this empty space you left behind\n(This part of you, this clock that stopped)\nI keep thinking you're still right beside me\n(This residue, it's all I got)\nYou're still there\nThere's this empty space you left behind\n(This part of you, this clock that stopped)\nAll the love you gave, it still defines me\nThere's this empty space you left behind\nI keep thinking you're still right beside me\nThere's this empty space you left behind\nI keep thinking you're still right beside me\nThere's this empty space you left behind\nAll the love you gave, it still defines me"
