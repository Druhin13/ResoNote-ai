  "lyrics": "Rooms hold people\r\nYear after year\r\nTenants come and go\r\nThe walls don't care if you're here\r\nThese walls are unforgiving\n\nAs the night is black\n\nThe world can be a real mean place\n\nWhen no one's got your back\n\n\n\nI had a premonition\n\nIt's all gonna be fine\n\nYou can kill or be killed\n\nBut the sun's gonna shine\n\n\n\nI had a premonition\n\nThat we're gonna get by\n\nYou and I have a love\n\nThat never can die\n\n\n\nIt's not the weight you carry\n\nIt's how you carry it\n\nWe can get through anything\n\nWe can take the hit\n\n\n\nI had a premonition\n\nIt's all gonna be fine\n\nYou can kill or be killed\n\nBut the sun's gonna shine\n\n\n\nI had a premonition\n\nThat we're gonna get by\n\nYou and I have a love\n\nThat never can die\n\n\n\nSweetheart don't ever doubt\n\nThat my love is alive\n\nYou and I can really live\n\nMuch more than survive"
