  "lyrics": "Every day, I go to a school that likes to help with learning\r\nOne, two, threes they're the keys\r\nBasic math, very easy\r\nTo Baldi's world of fun, where no one leaves 'til educated\r\nEvery door is locked up tight, stay inside 'til we're graded\n\nThe students try their best to better their education\n\nComprehend the material\n\nStudy hard, relay every detail\n\nNobody wants detention, we only want attention\n\nEven when life is tough\n\nOddly, quarters are enough\n\n\n\nThis is how we live our lives, searching\n\nFor the answers inside of every page\n\nAnd I'm here wondering if one day\n\nWe'll finally be free from this cage\n\nIs it okay to have a feeling\n\nThat maybe there is more to this game?\n\nHowever, now no time to question, so just behave\n\n\n\nWalking across the hallways, finding notebooks so we matter\n\nFollow every single rule or he'll take out his wooden ruler\n\nFor he is listening and watching everyone's progression\n\nAll mistakes have consequences, so answer right with every question\n\n\n\nTry to add up excuses, nothing will make a difference\n\nBaldi knows every door that we open\n\nFollowing from behind, we can hear him\n\nThere is no place for playtime\n\nAvoid them all from every side\n\nBetter to leave him be, follow his philosophy\n\n\n\nThis is how we live our lives, searching\n\nFor the answers inside of every page\n\nAnd I'm here wondering if one day\n\nWe'll finally be free from this cage\n\nIs it okay to have a feeling\n\nThat maybe there is more to this game?\n\nHowever, now just keep behaving\n\n\n\nSweep through the halls\n\nTo escape will have some sacrifices\n\nNo room for jealousy\n\nI've got no time to play hide and seek\n\n'Cause eventually, he'll surely find me\n\nHave to be brave or better keep behaving\n\n\n\nCount\n\n'Til I don't know what counts\n\n\n\nEvery inch of fear is all that's ingrained\n\nCan't understand, what's the solution?\n\nThe problem is the mess in my brain\n\nI'm pushed around with all the pressure\n\nTo be here when I don't wanna stay\n\nThere's gotta be some sort of exit to get away"
