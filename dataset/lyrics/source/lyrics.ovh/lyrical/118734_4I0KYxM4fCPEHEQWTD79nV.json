  "lyrics": "Well it's Saturday night \nYou're all dressed up in blue \nI been watching you awhile \nMaybe you been watching me too \nSo somebody ran out \nLeft somebody's heart in a mess \n\nWell if you're looking for love \n\nHoney I'm tougher than the rest \n\n\n\nSome girls they want a handsome Dan \n\nOr some good-lookin' Joe, on their arm \n\nSome girls like a sweet-talkin' Romeo \n\nWell 'round here baby \n\nI learned you get what you can get \n\nSo if you're rough enough for love \n\nHoney I'm tougher than the rest \n\n\n\nThe road is dark \n\nAnd it's a thin thin line \n\nBut I want you to know I'll walk it for you any time \n\nMaybe your other boyfriends \n\nCouldn't pass the test \n\nWell if you're rough and ready for love \n\nHoney I'm tougher than the rest \n\n\n\nWell it ain't no secret \n\nI've been around a time or two \n\nWell I don't know baby maybe you've been around too \n\nWell there's another dance \n\nAll you gotta do is say yes \n\nAnd if you're rough and ready for love \n\nHoney I'm tougher than the rest \n\nIf you're rough enough for love \n\nBaby I'm tougher than the rest"
