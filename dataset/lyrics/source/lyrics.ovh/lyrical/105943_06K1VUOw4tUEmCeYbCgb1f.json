  "lyrics": "She got hair as gold as Kansas wheat\r\nHer body moves like Bourbon street\r\nIn New Orleans, so wild and free\r\nShe's a California red sunset\r\nStars in her eyes, stripes on her dress\r\nEvery summer night feels like the fourth of July\n\n\n\nShe's American\n\nMaking my world better than it's ever been\n\nOne part Norma Jean and one part Marilyn\n\nShe's making me fall in love with everything American\n\n\n\nShe's a small town smile, a little white church\n\n'Born to run' on a faded t-shirt\n\nAll I know is I'm at home when I'm with her\n\n\n\nYeah, I grew up singing Eagles songs\n\nSometimes I wonder what took so long\n\nTo feel enough to give the best of my love\n\nShe's New York pretty all dressed up\n\nBut a southern bell in the back of her truck\n\nOn an old dirt road, she's where I wanna go\n\n\n\nShe's American\n\nMaking my world better than it's ever been\n\nOne part Norma Jean and one part Marilyn\n\nShe's making me fall in love with everything American\n\n\n\nAmerican\n\n(American, American)\n\n\n\nShe's a small town smile, a little white church\n\n'Born to run' on a faded t-shirt\n\nAll I know is I'm at home when I'm with her\n\n\n\nShe's American\n\nMaking my world better than it's ever been\n\nOne part Norma Jean and one part Marilyn\n\nShe's making me fall in love with everything American\n\n\n\nShe's a small town smile in a little white church\n\n'Born to run' on a faded t-shirt\n\nAll I know is I'm at home when I'm with her"
