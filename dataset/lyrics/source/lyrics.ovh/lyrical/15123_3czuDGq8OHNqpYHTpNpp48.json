  "lyrics": "Pulled in to meet you, windows down\r\nDuct taped mirrors, exhaust pourin' out\r\nAlways late, never unwound\r\nWhen will I learn to shut my mouth?\r\nGuess I'm rough, rough around the edges\n\nHoney I'm rough, rough around the edges\n\n\n\nYou find the beauty in the simple things\n\nIn desert sunsets and in movie scenes\n\nI see the flaws and all the in-betweens\n\nThe past was cruel and it caught up with me\n\n\n\nGuess I'm rough, rough around the edges\n\nHoney I'm rough, rough around the edges\n\n\n\nCurtains closed so I can sleep in late\n\nNothin' on the TV, but it always plays\n\nDirty dishes, buds in the ash try\n\nDon't feel like pickin' up the damn phone today\n\n\n\nI'm feelin' rough, rough around the edges\n\nHoney I'm rough, rough around the edges\n\n\n\nIf I let you down, baby, don't take it too hard\n\nWhen my mind becomes a question mark\n\nWhen I want closure, then I get confused\n\nDon't believe in much, but I believe in you\n\n\n\nI'm just rough, rough around the edges\n\nHoney I'm rough, rough around the edges"
