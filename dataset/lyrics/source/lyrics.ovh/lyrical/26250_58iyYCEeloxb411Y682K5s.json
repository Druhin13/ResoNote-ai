  "lyrics": "Everything has no one to save us\r\n(Fraction mammoths, the gaps are growing)\r\nThe dying decades, that first reveals all\r\nTotal withdrawal, silence for all\r\nThe last generation by polarisation\r\nSolitary youth, this laziness finds its truth\n\n\n\nI will be your weakness, I will help you make sense\n\nI will be your battle ground, can I tie your blindfold?\n\n\n\nSo far while you hold my fingers tight\n\nSecond soundtrack to withdraw tonight\n\nSo far while you hold my fingers tight\n\nSecond soundtrack to withdraw tonight\n\n\n\nSo keep walking slow like a pilgrim\n\n(Even when your heart is breaking)\n\nA gentle crew rise to their feet you know\n\nTotal withdrawal, silence for all\n\nThe last generation by polarisation\n\nSolitary youth, this laziness finds its truth\n\n\n\nI will be your weakness, I will help you make sense\n\nI will be your battle ground, can I tie your blindfold?\n\n\n\nSo far while you hold my fingers tight\n\nSecond soundtrack to withdraw tonight\n\nSo far while you hold my fingers tight\n\nSecond soundtrack to withdraw tonight\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far while you hold my fingers tight\n\nSecond soundtrack to withdraw tonight\n\nSo far while you hold my fingers tight\n\nSecond soundtrack to withdraw tonight"
