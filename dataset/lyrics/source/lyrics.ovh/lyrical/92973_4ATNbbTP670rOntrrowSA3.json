  "lyrics": "Taffy spun, wild horses run\r\nAnd the walls are filled with molasses\r\nYou said I look pretty by the frozen Mississippi\r\nThe future felt fantastic\r\nLottery, I stole a Christmas tree\r\nYou stood watch in the hotel hall\n\nYou lit up our room like a waning moon\n\nOf melting plastic\n\n\n\nJust a couple hours (Hours)\n\nWe'll have superpowers\n\nI wanna get lost\n\nOver that bridge to La Crosse\n\n\n\nRarely could toss\n\nThrowing dice on the bar\n\nYour ranting, I couldn’t stand it\n\nI cut the apple in two, it just wouldn't do\n\nBaby, you're so romantic\n\nEndless talk, not getting old\n\nI could not leave it alone\n\nI wanted to please you, my dress was see-through\n\nAs I looked through your phone\n\n\n\nI am such a coward\n\nHow could you send her flowers?\n\nI want to get lost\n\nThere’s a bridge to La Crosse\n\n\n\nIn a Chinese robe, I spun the globe\n\nAnd my finger landed back home\n\nIf you're not willing\n\nThen I'm not giving you my heart of gold\n\nNudie pics, I do not regret it\n\nI knew that you were gone\n\nI did so freely and wanted you to see me\n\nOff that throne you put me on\n\n\n\nJust a couple hours\n\nWe'll have superpowers\n\nI'm gonna get lost\n\nOver that bridge from La Crosse"
