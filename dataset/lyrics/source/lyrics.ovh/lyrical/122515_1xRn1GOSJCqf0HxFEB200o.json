  "lyrics": "I've been on the road, bringing back money\r\nYeah, I've been digging gold, I hope you still want me\r\nI know I've been gone a little too long\r\nBut money don't grow, so I gotta go\r\nI've been chasing dimes\r\nIt's been so lonely, yeah, I've been in the mines\n\nI'm sorry my hours don't work out right\n\nI know I keep you up at night\n\n\n\n'Cause ain't much changed but my age\n\nThe man you love is the same\n\nDon't you know that hearts can break easy?\n\nI gave you the best of my pieces\n\n\n\nPromise me you'll let me come back home\n\nKeep my bed warm\n\n'Cause I'm bringing it all back to you\n\nOnly say you'll be there when I do\n\n\n\nPromise you get the best of me\n\nOnly you get the rest of me\n\nGot my mind on your waist\n\nYou're the life of my party\n\nGot a lot to do\n\nCan't stay in one place too long, I've been on the move\n\nI know you've been waiting, but here's the truth\n\nI want someone to come home to\n\n\n\n'Cause ain't much changed but my age\n\nThe man you love is the same\n\nAnd don't you know that hearts can break easy?\n\nI gave you the best of my pieces\n\n\n\nPromise me you'll let me come back home\n\nKeep my bed warm\n\n'Cause I'm bringing it all back to you (Back to you)\n\nOnly say you'll be there when I do\n\nPromise me\n\n\n\nWe're not gonna lose this\n\n'Cause I'm on my way right now\n\nIt's only home with you in it\n\nNow I'm so close it's unfair\n\n\n\n'Cause ain't much changed but my age\n\nThe man you love is the same\n\nAnd don't you know that hearts can break easy?\n\nI gave you the best of my pieces\n\n\n\nPromise me you'll let me come back home\n\nKeep my bed warm\n\n'Cause I'm bringing it all back to you (Back to you)\n\nOnly say you'll be there when I do\n\n\n\nPromise me\n\nPromise me\n\nPromise you get the best of me\n\nOnly you get that recipe\n\nGot my mind on your waist"
