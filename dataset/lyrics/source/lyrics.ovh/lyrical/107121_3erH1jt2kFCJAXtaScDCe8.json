  "lyrics": "I am strong and full of life\r\nI am steadfast, no compromise\r\nI lift my sails to the sky\r\nI’m gonna catch the wind, I’m gonna catch the wind\r\nI am bold, no fear inside\n\nSpread my wings, open my life\n\nLike an eagle, whose home is the sky\n\nI’m gonna catch the wind, I’m gonna catch the wind\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nYour faithfulness will never let me down\n\nI’m confident I’ll see Your goodness now\n\nI know You hear my heart, I’m singing \n\nThere’s nothing that can stop Your goodness now\n\n\n\nBridge:\n\nLike standing on the edge of a mountainside\n\nI can feel the wind stirring, lifting me up high\n\nI was born into freedom, I was made to fly"
