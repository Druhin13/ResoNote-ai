  "lyrics": "They sat together in the park\r\nAs the evening sky grew dark,\r\nShe looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.\r\n'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight\r\nAnd watched out for a simple twist of fate.\n\nThey walked along by the old canal\n\nA little confused, I remember well\n\nAnd stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.\n\nHe felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train\n\nMoving with a simple twist of fate.\n\n\n\nA saxophone someplace far off played\n\nAs she was walkin' by the arcade.\n\nAs the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,\n\nShe dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate\n\nAnd forgot about a simple twist of fate.\n\n\n\nHe woke up, the room was bare\n\nHe didn't see her anywhere.\n\nHe told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,\n\nFelt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate\n\nBrought on by a simple twist of fate.\n\n\n\nHe hears the ticking of the clocks\n\nAnd walks along with a parrot that talks,\n\nHunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in.\n\nMaybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait\n\nOnce more for a simple twist of fate.\n\n\n\nPeople tell me it's a sin\n\nTo know and feel too much within.\n\nI still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring.\n\nShe was born in spring, but I was born too late\n\nBlame it on a simple twist of fate."
