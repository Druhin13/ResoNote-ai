  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Daphne Blue par The Band CAMINO\r\nI don't wanna talk about it\nAnd I think we both know why\nI wish it wasn't automatic\nThe way I want you every time\n\nI see shades of you when I don't want to\nCan't think straight since you've been gone\nSaw someone out in your go-to outfit\nRight when I thought I was on\n\nYou've got me off track\nGot me thinkin' abstract\nBaby, look at what you've done\nStill you've got me wantin' some\nBody on body contact\nI love it, but I hate that\n\nBlack jeans and Daphne blue\nStill make me think of you\n\nI hesitate to say the ocean\nCould hold a candle to your eyes\nYou shut the door and cut me open\nNow I'm wishing I was colorblind\n\n'Cause I see shades of you when I don't want to\nRight when I thought I was on\n\nYou've got me off track\nGot me thinkin' abstract\nBaby, look at what you've done\nStill you've got me wantin' some\nBody on body contact\nI love it, but I hate that\nBlack jeans and Daphne blue\n\nStill make me think of you\n\nYou've got me off track\nGot me thinkin' abstract\nBaby, look at what you've done\nStill you've got me wantin' some\nBody on body contact\nI love it, but I hate that\nBlack jeans and Daphne blue\nStill make me think of you"
