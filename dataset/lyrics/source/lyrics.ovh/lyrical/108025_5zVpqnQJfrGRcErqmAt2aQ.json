A soda? Campari? With lemon? Well, you got it\n\nI got better things to do than shave my legs, my pits, oh yeah\n\n\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m looking ‘cross the room and hoping that you’re looking too, yeah\n\n\n\nDo you have any siblings?\n\nYou got a sister, yeah, she’s a detective\n\nWell I'll bet she’s got some good stories\n\nI gotta go but I hope we can keep in touch\n\nI like very much being here with you\n\nBut you see, all this small talk is killing me, yeah\n\n\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m looking ‘cross the room and hoping that you’re looking too\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m looking ‘cross the room and hoping that you’re looking too, yeah\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m looking ‘cross the room and hoping that you’re looking too\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m waiting here for you\n\nI’m looking ‘cross the room and hoping that you’re looking too"
