  "lyrics": "Is it sad that I don't even remember your name?\r\n'Cause when I said it out loud I didn't feel any pain\r\nAnd even seein' my tears on the pages, nothing's dropped my mind\r\nI'm runnin' through all those memories of the spring of '99\r\nFriday nights spent in front of a movie screen\n\nAround all of our friends, you'd be so mean\n\nBut then you're steal by my side and whisper somethin' underneath your breath\n\nLike how you wish you were holdin' my hand instead\n\nBut I've forgotten everything you've said\n\n\n\nAh, who was (Who was)\n\nWho was Jameson?\n\nTell me, what was your name again?\n\nAh, who was (Who was)\n\nWho was Jameson?\n\nTell me, what was your name again?\n\n\n\nI couldn't pick your face from a lineup\n\nI wouldn't know your voice if it came up\n\nSadly all those nights that I stayed up cryin'\n\nI can't recall lovin' you\n\n\n\nSo how do I know the details of this affair?\n\nBecause I wrote it all down and if you read it you'd be sure that I'd really cared\n\nIs it some kind of beauty that you didn't leave your mark on me?\n\nThat I can say the name \"Jameson\" and it doesn't light a spark in me\n\n'Cause I've forgotten you completely\n\n\n\nAh, who was (Who was)\n\nWho was Jameson?\n\nTell me, what was your name again?\n\nAh, who was (Who was)\n\nWho was Jameson?\n\nTell me, what was your name again?\n\n\n\nTell me, who was Jameson?\n\nTell me, what was your name again?\n\nAh\n\nAh"
