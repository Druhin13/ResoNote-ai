  "lyrics": "And just when we discover that we need each other\r\nHere, our lives keep pulling us away\r\nNow we're both so unstable at the kitchen table\r\nWith these peanut bagels in a foreign state\r\nBecause the point is that I see it's not just me\n\nThe point is that you feel my company\n\nI don't wanna say goodbye\n\nGuess I'll see you when my screen is vibrating\n\n\n\nIt's not just me\n\nI know you're feeling the same way\n\nAnd I can't fail to believe\n\nWhen you're feeling the same way\n\nIt's not just me\n\nI know you're feeling the same way\n\nAnd I can't fail to believe\n\nWhen you're feeling the same way\n\nIt's not just me\n\n\n\nBack then, I'd just decided I was so misguided\n\nThat you'd all forget about me, in time\n\nBet you remember it was New Year's Eve\n\nSparklers through Palaced streets\n\nWe knew though years do change\n\nWe'd always feel the same\n\n\n\nBecause the point is that I see it's not just me\n\nThe point is that you feel my company\n\nYou know I'll never be too far if you're looking for somebody\n\nI'm here\n\n\n\nIt's not just me\n\nI know you're feeling the same way\n\nAnd I can't fail to believe\n\nWhen you're feeling the same way\n\nIt's not just me\n\nI know you're feeling the same way\n\nAnd I can't fail to believe\n\nWhen you're feeling the same way\n\nIt's not just me\n\n\n\nSeems so hard youâ€™ll start to feel so\n\nGood at not sweeping it under the carpet\n\nIt seems so hard you'll start to feel so\n\nGood at not sweeping it under the carpet\n\nI know when you know\n\n\n\nIt's not just me\n\nI know you're feeling the same way\n\nAnd I can't fail to believe\n\nWhen you're feeling the same way\n\nIt's not just me\n\nI know you're feeling the same way\n\nAnd I can't fail to believe\n\nWhen you're feeling the same way\n\nIt's not just me"
