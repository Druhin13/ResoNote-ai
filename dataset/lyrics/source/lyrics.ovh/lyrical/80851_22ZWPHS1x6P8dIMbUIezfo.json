  "lyrics": "Like a memory\r\nOf the time before\r\nLike words lost throughout all time\r\nLike rain drops\r\nOn barren lands\r\nThey are destined to dry and fade away\n\nNow the compass calls\n\nNavigate our way\n\nTo the land beyond the North Star\n\nBorn to nothingness\n\nDied for none at all\n\nFrom nothing born and to nothingâ€¦\n\n(Return)\n\nLeft behind forsaken and lost they are the ones out of mind\n\nLeft behind fragments of memories they are the ones that are blind\n\nThey are left behind\n\nDo not forsake us within the shadows we wait\n\nFor salvation pray\n\nLives in disarray\n\nLeaves fallen from the tree of life\n\nTruth they will delete\n\nWith merciless deceit\n\nOur voice is taken away\n\nLeft behind the chains on our hands\n\nStill we cannot unbind\n\nLeft behind the key to our freedom\n\nWithin us we must find\n\nLeft behind like an orphan abandoned and lost throughout all time\n\nLeft behind they are the victims, unpunished is the crime\n\nThey are left behind"
