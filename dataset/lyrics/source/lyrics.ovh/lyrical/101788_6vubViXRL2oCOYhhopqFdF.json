  "lyrics": "You drink my whiskey without askin', you put your boots up on my couch\r\nIt drives me crazy to remind you more than once to take the garbage out\r\nYou use my good towels on the dog - that's the only thing I've asked you not to do\r\nMost days I'd love to lock you out\r\nI can't live without you\n\nThe kitchen table ain't for business, I wish you'd put the bills where they go\n\nI guess you'd need an invitation to the backyard to see that it needs mowin'\n\nYou leave your whiskers in the sink, and I've told you 'til I'm black and blue\n\nYou never worried what our neighbors think\n\nI can't live without you\n\n\n\n'Cause you've got my back even when I'm wrong\n\nYou're the only one who knows me and my heart can't get along\n\nI got reasons to cry and can't tell you which one\n\nBut you don't ask no questions, you just hold me 'til I'm done\n\nAnd when I'm lookin' to fight, you flat refuse\n\nI can't live without you\n\n\n\nYou're always voicin' your opinion, you play your guitar way too loud\n\nAnd God I reckon it would kill you to lift a finger and help me clean this house\n\nYou know, your jokes ain't all that funny, but I'll keep on laughin' if you want me to\n\nNobody understands why I love you\n\nI can't live without you\n\n\n\nYou've got my back even when I'm wrong\n\nYou're the only one who knows me and my heart can't get along\n\nI got some reasons to cry, can't tell you which one\n\nBut you don't ask no questions, you just hold me 'til I'm done\n\nAnd when I'm lookin' to fight, you flat refuse\n\nI can't live without you\n\nI can't live without you"
