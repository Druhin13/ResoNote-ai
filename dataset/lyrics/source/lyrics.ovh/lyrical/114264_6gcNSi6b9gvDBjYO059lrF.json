  "lyrics": "My grandpa taught me about buck knifes and shot guns\r\nHow to cast an old Zebco\r\nAnd how to work a stick shift\r\nHe taught me the bible about all twelve disciples\r\nAnd he made sure that I know there's life after this\r\nWith pearly gates and streets of gold\n\nHe said if I just believe that's where I'll go\n\nLord when I die I wanna live\n\nOn the outskirts of Heaven\n\nWhere there's dirt roads for miles\n\nHay in the fields and fish in the river\n\nWhere there's dogwood trees and honey bees\n\nAnd blue skies and green grass forever\n\nLord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven\n\nNow it says in the King James in the Almighty's kingdom\n\nHe mentions a mansion that he's built just for me\n\nNow I'd gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage\n\nAnd a back yard that's shaded and a squeaky front porch swing\n\nThat's where I wanna hang my wings\n\nWhen I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven\n\nWhere there's dirt roads for miles\n\nHay in the fields and fish in the river\n\nWhere there's dogwood trees and honey bees\n\nAnd blue skies and green grass forever\n\nSo Lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, the good Lord knows me\n\nHe knows I need blue skies and green grass forever\n\nLord when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven\n\nYeah, when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of Heaven"
