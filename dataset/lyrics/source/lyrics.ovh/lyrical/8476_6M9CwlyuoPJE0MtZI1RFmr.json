  "lyrics": "Staring here at these white walls\r\nAn empty canvas on my downfalls\r\nNo illusion greater than fear\r\nTry to overcome but my vision's unclear\r\n'Cause all my good intentions been tangled up\r\nAll my hopes been buried, gotta dig 'em up\n\nAll my life I've been trying not to mess it up\n\nYou know I had enough\n\n\n\nLay me down, carry me away\n\nLet the clock unwind the years on tape\n\nRewind, start again\n\nIf I turn back before I break\n\nI pray my soul my soul to take\n\nRewind, start again\n\n\n\nCaught in the clouds, wishing for blue skies\n\nRolling the river, bound to capsize\n\nIf I could grab the wheel and just steer\n\nTry to overcome, the directions unclear 'cause\n\nAll my words I've been saying get tangled up\n\nAll my steps coming down seem to trip me up\n\nAll my life I've been trying not to mess it up\n\nYou know I had enough, yeah\n\n\n\nLay me down, carry me away\n\nLet the clock unwind the years on tape\n\nRewind, start again\n\nIf I turn back before I break\n\nI pray my soul my soul to take\n\nRewind, start again\n\n\n\nLay me down, take me to the river\n\nWash away, tell me you'll deliver me\n\nAnd lay me down, I'm still alive\n\nRewind, deliver me, deliver me\n\n\n\nLay me down, carry me away\n\nLet the clock unwind the years on tape\n\nRewind, start again (deliver me)\n\n(Deliver me, deliver me)\n\nIf I turn back before I break\n\nI pray my soul my soul to take\n\nRewind, start again (deliver me)\n\n(Deliver me, deliver me)\n\n\n\nRewind, deliver me, deliver me\n\nRewind, start again\n\n\n\nIf I turn back before I break\n\nI pray my soul my soul to take\n\nRewind, start again"
