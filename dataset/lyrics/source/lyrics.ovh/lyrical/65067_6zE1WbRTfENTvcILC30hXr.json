  "title": "Sleep (Arr. R.J. Nowlin) [Live]",
  "lyrics": "The evening hangs beneath the moon, a silver thread on darkened dune.\r\nWith closing eyes and resting head; I know that sleep is coming soon.\r\nUpon my pillow, safe in bed, a thousand pictures fill my head, I cannot sleep , my mids aflight; and yet my limbs seems made of lead.\r\n\nSimultaneous Split:\r\n(SAT) If there are noises in the night, a frightening shadow, Flickerering light;\n\n\n\n(B) If there are noises in the night, in the night\n\n\n\nThen I surrender unto sleep, where cloads of dream give second sight.\n\nWhat dreams may come, both dark and deep--\n\n\n\nSimultaneous Split:\n\n\n\n(SA) of flying wings and soaring leap?\n\n-As I surrender unto sleep.-\n\nRepeat 3x\n\n\n\n(TB) -dark and deep-\n\nRepeat 3x\n\n...dark, unto sleep\n\n\n\n-Sleep-\n\nRepeat at least 10x\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Lee for these lyrics)"
