  "lyrics": "Stale tongues, the words have gone\r\nAnd all we've left is smoky spirits and heavy lungs\r\nAnd I don't want to talk it through\r\nBut my head hurts and I hate you\r\nDon't make me throw up\n\nI know that you will\n\nAnd wake up my mother and tell her I'm ill\n\n\n\nIt's all coming out now, black, brown\n\nWine and vile\n\n\n\nSalty eyes, some frothy lips\n\nYour teeth are bent and champing at the fucking bit\n\nLeading on the window\n\nWill you point them and you let go\n\n\n\nYou say: look at the people\n\nCrawling like insects\n\nAll over the pavements\n\n\n\nI'd rather be with them\n\nCause I just hate this room, it smells like you\n\n\n\nLeave it all, I like this song\n\nWhen it ends, you really must be getting on\n\nAnd they need all clicks after I'm out\n\nAnd you look back and the door slams\n\n\n\nI'm so fucking heartless\n\nI can't even cry\n\nI've opened my body: it's hollow inside\n\n\n\nSo ring up my parents\n\nAnd tell them I'm dead\n\nAnd say how you bite me: you fucked with my head\n\n\n\nAnd I hate your head, and the clothes you wear\n\nAnd I just love your head, and the clothes you wear"
