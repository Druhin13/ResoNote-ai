  "lyrics": "We stood outside the bank you once robbed\r\nHoping that someone would recognize you\r\nAnd then we stood outside for hours and hours\r\nBut nobody could recognize you\r\nAnd then we took off our shoes and we took off our clothes\r\nAnd we jumped into the lake\n\n\n\nThis was never a mistake\n\nNo, this was never a mistake\n\nI welcomed you into my arms\n\nAnd you welcomed me into your heart\n\n\n\nAnd I do wanna be here\n\nAnd I don't wanna go\n\nAnd I do wanna be here\n\n\n\nI'm talking to my best friend\n\nAnd we're talking like these days will never end\n\nI'm talking to my best friend\n\nAnd we're talking like\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\n\n\nWe drove to upstate New York looking for your father's grave\n\nWe drove there all the way and it took hours and hours\n\nWe passed your old neighbourhood and your old house too\n\nAnd that tree that you fell out of as a kid\n\nAnd then we finally found it and there was a super mall instead\n\nSo we laughed off our heads, we laughed off our heads\n\n\n\nI do wanna be here\n\nAnd I don't wanna go\n\nAnd I do wanna be here\n\n\n\nI'm talking to my best friend\n\nAnd we're talking like these days will never end\n\nI'm talking to my best friend\n\nAnd we're talking like\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\n\n\nAnd then you said away\n\nBut I guessed you'll come back to stay\n\nOur phases, never just a phase\n\nWe all change in so many ways\n\n\n\nAnd the phases, never just a phase\n\nAnd we change in so many ways\n\nAnd the phases, never just a phase\n\nAnd we change, yes we change\n\n\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese days will never end\n\nThese will never end\n\n\n\nAnd I do wanna be here\n\nAnd I don't wanna go\n\nAnd I do wanna be here\n\nAnd I don't wanna go\n\nAnd I do wanna be here\n\nAnd I don't wanna go\n\nBut I don't wanna be anywhere else"
