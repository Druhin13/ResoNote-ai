  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Different Blue par General Elektriks\r\nThere’s an ocean, wide and blue\nI’m just a drop sucked up by the heat\nHeat of the sun generated by you\nAnd I’m tinted with your blue\nTinted with this blue\nDifferent blue\n\nThere’s a connection, deep and true\nThe air vibrated and wrapped us around you\nAnd when you left the room we cried like we knew you\nForever tinted with your blue\nTinted with this blue\nDifferent blue"
