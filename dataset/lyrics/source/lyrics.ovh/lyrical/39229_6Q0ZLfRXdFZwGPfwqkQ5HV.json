  "lyrics": "She's lookin friday night ready\r\nTearin' up interstate twenty\r\nGot the tank topped off\r\nDust flyin' like confetti\r\nIn the rearview\r\nGot a clear view\n\nOf these getaway tracks\n\nYou got the seat kicked back\n\nRadio bumpin' that glass\n\nYou lookin' at me\n\nLookin' at you\n\nSurfin' that hand\n\nWith the power lines\n\nYeah in no time\n\nWe're nowhere fast\n\n\n\nWe're just wastin' gas, woah\n\nBlurring them dotted lines\n\nKilling all kinds of time\n\nBaby, like we ain't coming back, woah\n\nSteal a kiss, maybe two\n\nPull it off for a few\n\nGonna hang as long as I can\n\nYou know I don't give it a damn\n\nIf we're just wastin' gas\n\n\n\nEvery once in a while\n\nIt'll backfire like a gun\n\nI see that needle creeping down\n\nLike a setting sun\n\nMaking every little memory one of a kind\n\nYou and I riding high all night\n\n\n\nWe're just wastin' gas, woah\n\nBlurring them dotted lines\n\nKilling all kinds of time\n\nBaby, like we ain't coming back, woah\n\nSteal a kiss, maybe two\n\nPull it off for a few\n\nGonna hang as long as I can\n\nYou know I don't give it a damn\n\nIf we're just wastin' gas\n\n\n\nWe're just wastin' gas, woah\n\nBlurring them dotted lines\n\nKilling all kinds of time\n\nBaby, like we ain't coming back, woah\n\nSteal a kiss, maybe two\n\nPull it off for a few\n\nGonna hang as long as I can\n\nYou know I don't give it a damn\n\nIf we're just wastin' gas"
