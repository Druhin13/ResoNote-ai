  "lyrics": "I'm out late, there's a half naked crowd of people\r\nLet them in with their blank cheques & deep pockets\r\nHard living, paint peeling, all the dark days\r\nLittle rays of light moving I couldn't let go\r\nIn the bar her name is Jonny, the boys love her\n\nTime waits, the light revealing all the dark ways\n\nBad feeling, it's you I need, I'm tired of the phone calls\n\nDo I give myself to the outside?\n\n\n\nIt's no fun\n\nWhen I spend my time in cars\n\nLike the stars\n\nBut it's ok\n\nI'm ok\n\nIn a smaller orbit\n\nLet's run like horses\n\n\n\nA lot of ways I could start making little changes\n\nBut I'm too stoned in the back seat again, I couldn't stop it\n\nThen the panic soon surrounds me like deep water\n\nSo I give myself to the outside\n\n\n\nIt's no fun\n\nWhen I spend my time in cars\n\nLike the stars\n\nBut it's ok\n\nI'm ok\n\nIn a smaller orbit\n\nLet's run like horses\n\nThere's a black star\n\nRight in my line of vision\n\nOh I miss her\n\nBut nobody\n\nNobody gets forgotten\n\nRun like horses"
