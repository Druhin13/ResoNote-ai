  "lyrics": "You turned your shoulder and looked back at me\r\nThanked me for my blind belief\r\nYou said \"I'll be going for a little while\"\r\nThere's no need to tell me so don't even try\r\nDon't ever wonder if you're on my mind\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\n\n\nEach of us, we got a dream to chase\n\nWouldn't have it any other way\n\nWe're stronger by far from the risk we take\n\nNo, we ain't the kind to play it safe\n\nNo, we ain't the kind to play it safe\n\n\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nI know oh oh, gonna be alright\n\n\n\nThis place will slowly disappears\n\nAs I write to you from here\n\nWhen it was long, it pinned your hair\n\nYou placed it right behind my ear\n\nIt said if I write you every night\n\nThen oh oh oh, it's gonna be alright\n\n\n\nOh oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nI know oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nI know oh oh, gonna be alright\n\nI know oh oh, gonna be alright"
