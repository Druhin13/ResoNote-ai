  "lyrics": "Busting a pose, shrug it off the same as when you say something you don’t mean\r\nThese strings are so dead, holding off on changing them, until one day they will just break\r\nSorrow and all\r\nFaces of doubt, haunted by the memories of everything minus the bad stuff\r\nSparkling light, God takes her vengeance on everyone’s burned to the ground\n\nSorrow and all\n\n\n\nDon’t tell me if you care, come alive with it, let it show\n\nAnd don’t wistfully believe I would die for it\n\nHolding a pose, why should I put everything into all these songs you just steal\n\nThe act in itself, fills me up in ways that connects me with everyone else\n\nDon’t tell me if you care, come alive with it, let it show\n\nDon’t wistfully believe I would die for this, what does that make me\n\nWhat does that make me\n\nWhat does that make me"
