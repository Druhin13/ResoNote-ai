  "lyrics": "I've been doing my best to make church on Sundays\r\nAnd ain't been calling in hungover most Mondays\r\nI guess you could say I'm being grown up\r\nI got my shit together and oddly enough\r\nI don't mind\r\n'Cause it's about time\n\nBut if you second guessin', don't think for a second\n\nThat I can't hang\n\n\n\n'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless\n\nKnown to have a little bit of beer with breakfast\n\nYou can bet these boots have got a little used to\n\nStomping on a hardwood floor\n\nAnd buying the bar another round of shots\n\nClose my tab and hit the parking lot\n\nNext stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch\n\nI ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line\n\nSo don't tempt me with a good time\n\n\n\nWell most folks think I don't know how to throw down\n\nThey done forgot about Rowdy\n\nBut no doubt he's still around\n\nSo keep cracking those jokes\n\n'Cause I'm willing and able\n\nYeah, this old boy'll drink you under the table\n\n\n\n'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless\n\nKnown to have a little bit of beer with breakfast\n\nYou can bet these boots have got a little used to\n\nStomping on a hardwood floor\n\nAnd buying the bar another round of shots\n\nClose my tab and hit the parking lot\n\nNext stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch\n\nI ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line\n\nSo don't tempt me with a good time\n\n\n\nAt 3AM I'm still hanging tough\n\nMy buddy's passed out in the bed of my truck\n\nAnd I can't wait 'til he wakes up\n\nAnd see the pictures on his phone\n\n\n\n'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless\n\nKnown to have a little bit of beer with breakfast\n\nYou can bet these boots have got a little used to\n\nStomping on a hardwood floor\n\nAnd buying the bar another round of shots\n\nClose my tab and hit the parking lot\n\nNext stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch\n\nI ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line\n\nSo don't tempt me with a good time\n\nWith a good time"
