  "lyrics": "Another harvest moon\r\nFireflies laying on you\r\nLay you across my blanket\r\nTruck bed big enough for two\r\nThe slightest touch can do\r\nSomething so new that I can't shake it\n\n\n\n'Fore we run out of time and the whiskey runs dry\n\nI still find my way right back to you\n\nAnd even with the dust in my eyes I can still see the signs\n\nAs I drive down this road made for two\n\nI feel, I feel\n\nLike I'm at home, like I'm at home\n\nI feel, I feel\n\nLike I'm at home, like I'm at home\n\n\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nYou never seem to call\n\nLike I'mma, like I'm at home\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nYou never fear I'm gone\n\n'Cause I'mma, I'm at home\n\nLa, la, la, la, la\n\n\n\nHold my heart, keep me in a comatose state\n\nGot my flannel on, you're looking like my little Cobain\n\nWaded in the water after mating by the lake\n\nWhere they don't go, where the sun always stays\n\n\n\n'Fore we run out of time and the whiskey runs dry\n\nI still find my way right back to you\n\nAnd even with the dust in my eyes I can still see the signs\n\nAs I drive down this road made for two\n\nI feel, I feel\n\nLike I'm at home, like I'm at home\n\nI feel, I feel\n\nLike I'm at home, like I'm at home\n\n\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nYou never seem to call\n\nLike I'mma, like I'm at home\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nYou never fear I'm gone\n\n'Cause I'mma, I'm at home\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\n\n\n\nTell me lies, tell me lies\n\nAll your dirty lies\n\nClose your eyes, cut the ties\n\nWho do you despise?\n\nPigeons fly, people die\n\nI don't question that\n\nI fall asleep, I fall asleep\n\nWho am I? Who am I?\n\nI'll let you decide\n\nLet me slide, pick a time\n\nFall back with the tide\n\nCome inside, cut the lights\n\nLet's live in the night\n\nAnd fall asleep, you'll fall for me\n\n\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nYou never seem to call\n\nLike I'mma, like I'm at home\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nWhen I'mma, when I'm alone\n\nYou never fear I'm gone\n\n'Cause I'mma, I'm at home\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\n\n\n\nYa llegué a casa, no hay más que darte ya\n\nYa llegué a casa, no hay más que darte ya\n\nYa llegué a casa, no hay más que darte ya"
