  "lyrics": "I knew when I met you there was trouble in sight\r\nGot so wrapped up in all your charm, I miss the girl in your eyes\r\nAnd looking back it really shouldn’t come as much a surprise\r\nThat I would catch you double dipping, you were slippin’ that night\r\nStupid, stupid boy!\n\nShould have stuck with toys\n\nDon’t go playing hard\n\nShouldn’t have to tell you that part\n\nWhat a mess you made\n\nWith your little games\n\nBaby you gon’ learn\n\nIf you mess with me you get hurt (ow!)\n\n\n\nDidn’t your mother teach you not to play with fire?\n\nCaught you red-handed should have been a better liar!\n\nI’ll make you burn like the ashes of a cigarette\n\nDidn’t your mother teach ya’? I’ll be the one to teach ya’\n\n\n\nWent on a shopping spree with your credit cards\n\nI met a stranger on the street, gave him the keys to your car\n\nTook all your stuff, I packed it up and left it out in the road\n\nI used to love you, now I’m busy pourin’ bleach on your clothes\n\n\n\nStupid, stupid boy!\n\nShould have stuck with toys\n\nDon’t go playing hard\n\nShouldn’t have to tell you that part\n\nWhat a mess you made\n\nWith your little games\n\nBaby you gon’ learn\n\nIf you mess with me you get hurt (ow!)\n\n\n\nDidn’t your mother teach you not to play with fire?\n\nCaught you red-handed should have been a better liar!\n\nI’ll make you burn like the ashes of a cigarette\n\nDidn’t your mother teach ya’? I’ll be the one to teach ya’\n\n\n\nOh, didn’t your mother teach ya’?\n\nDidn’t your mother teach ya’?\n\nIt hurts so bad I need you here\n\nI’ll make ya' burn away, you hurt me\n\nDidn’t your mother teach ya’?\n\nGuess I’m the one to teach ya’\n\n\n\nDidn’t your mother teach you not to play with fire?\n\nCaught you red-handed should have been a better liar!\n\nI’ll make you burn like the ashes of a cigarette\n\nDidn’t your mother teach ya’? I’ll be the one to teach ya’"
