  "lyrics": "I met you in a bar in San Francisco\r\nSaid you used to have a car before the repo\r\nSmoking Lucky cigarettes, I think the smoke went to my head\r\nAnd now that summer night plays on repeat\r\nWe climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide\n\nAnd played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times\n\nI'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life\n\nBut I know I won't forget San Francisco\n\nNo, I know I won't forget, I know I won't forget\n\nI know I won't forget that night in San Francisco\n\n\n\nIn San Francisco\n\nIn San Francisco\n\n\n\nI met you in a bar in San Francisco\n\nBut when the sun came up we had to let go\n\nWhen you took that Greyhound bus\n\nThought it was the end of us\n\nBut now, you're all I dream of when I sleep\n\n\n\nWe climbed the Golden Gate bridge just to watch the stars collide\n\nAnd played that Stevie Wonder song a couple thousand times\n\nI'm kinda scared to say it was the best night of my life\n\nBut I know I won't forget San Francisco\n\nNo, I know I won't forget, I know I won't forget\n\nI know I won't forget that night in San Francisco\n\n\n\nIn San Francisco\n\nIn San Fran\n\nIn San Francisco\n\nIn San Fran, in San Fran, in San Francisco"
