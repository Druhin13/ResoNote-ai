  "lyrics": "“Let the brother receive the light!”\r\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\r\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\r\nOff comes the blindfold, fools cop diamonds and buy gold\n\nWhile wise old elders try to tell us that my soul\n\nIs lost in the Matrix, a box, a cube\n\nYou watch the tube and eat up all their toxic food\n\nNow the chemicals are blocked from the pineal gland\n\nFor the first time I understand Ezekiel’s plan\n\nThat the second sanctorum of the most divine\n\nIs the body and the stairway to heaven is your spine\n\nAs above, so below, fuck waitin' on a sign\n\nThe key to heaven's gate is in the mind\n\nGod bless the blind; let the light shine step from the darkness\n\nAnd follow in the Father through Solomon’s arches\n\nThe wars over religion show that humans are horrible\n\nThe bible's allegorical… not historical\n\nMortals never get it so they try to control\n\nFree will, free speech and even each other's soul\n\nScroll through the temples of the monks and the rabbis\n\nThe medicine men, the metaphysical Medjays\n\nThe bodies get baptized, the wise get chastised\n\nYou taught you should pass by thoughts of your past lives\n\n\n\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\n\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\n\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\n\nThe widow's son\n\nYou can't define what's direct from the east\n\n\n\nI don't control the economy, mess with animal sodomy\n\nI don't know Illuminati but I'll show you geometry\n\nThe Pythagoras of rap, son of music and math\n\nYou know the myth but let's try to decipher the facts\n\nI'm from a league of gentlemen, Amadeus to Duke Ellington\n\nTy Cobb, Louis Armstrong and Thomas Edison\n\nPolicemen and veterans even without a weapon\n\nI'll cover 'cause every brother keeps a three-five-seven\n\nSo when we go undercover, ain't no witchcraft and devil shit\n\nIt's how we greet each other on the five points of fellowship\n\nThe pillars of Noah inscribed with the sciences\n\nThe eye of Jehovah watches over me like a lioness\n\nThe square that reminds me to square my actions\n\nAnd the compass that'll help me circumscribe my passions\n\nI'm attracted to the light like a moth in the dead of night\n\nBut internet conspiracy theories hoggin' the megabytes\n\nI pay 'em no mind, I rep it with pride\n\nThey ain't concerned with the truth it's not as sexy as the lies\n\n'Til the day that I die, but yo I already did\n\nI never felt so alive 'til they gave me the true grip\n\nPeace to four-letter, three-letter, P.H.A\n\nIt's York Rite, Scottish rite and the DeMolay's\n\nO.E.S., yes can't forget the brothers before me\n\nShoulder to shoulder I stand with you all in the quarry\n\n\n\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\n\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\n\nThe widow's son, the wickedest one\n\nThe widow's son\n\nYou can't define what's direct from the east\n\n\n\nWickedest one\n\nI have the power!\n\nWickedest one\n\nI have the power!\n\nWickedest one\n\n\n\nThis is the most beautiful day of your life. Of your own free will you decided to undergo the initiation that other heroes have passed. Your sacrifice completes my sanctuary. This is the holy book. Learn to believe in me"
