  "lyrics": "I can hear the music from the bars out in the street\r\nI got a neon rhythm in my hands and in my feet\r\nDancin' here with you and the way you look at me\r\nYou set fire to the moon, there's nowhere else I'd rather be\r\nAnd every song we're singin', we're singin' about us\n\nThis night could last forever, but it won't be long enough\n\n\n\n'Cause we're drunk on love and whiskey shots\n\nSo what, the clock says 1 a.m\n\nAnd we'll raise a glass to the wild and free\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\n\n\nThrow a 20 in the jukebox, playin' DJ for the night\n\nGot some friends in low places helpin' us get high\n\nYeah, the morning's comin' quick, but we got time to steal a kiss\n\nIt's like the best nights of our lives are gonna all go down like this\n\n\n\n'Cause we're drunk on love and whiskey shots\n\nSo what, the clock says 2 a.m\n\nAnd we'll raise a glass to the wild and free\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\n\n\nEvery song we're singing's out of tune and out of time\n\nWe're just gettin' started when they're callin' closin' time\n\n\n\n'Cause we're drunk on love and whiskey shots\n\nSo what, the clock says 3 a.m\n\nAnd we'll raise a glass to the wild and free\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\nYeah, we're drunk on love and whiskey shots\n\nSo what, the clock says 4 a.m\n\nAnd the sun will rise long before we sleep\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\nWe will never be this young again\n\nWe will never be this young again"
