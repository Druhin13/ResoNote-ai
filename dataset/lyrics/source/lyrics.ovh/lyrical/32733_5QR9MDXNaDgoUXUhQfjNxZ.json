  "lyrics": "Just smile for me and let the day begin\r\nYou are the sunshine that lights my heart within\r\nI'm sure that you're an angel in disguise\r\nCome take my hand and together we will ride\r\nOn the wings of love up and above the clouds\n\nThe only way to fly is on the wings of love\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love only the two of us\n\nTogether flying high\n\nFlying high upon the wings of love\n\n\n\nYou look at me and I begin to melt\n\nJust like the snow\n\nWhen a ray of sun is felt\n\nI'm crazy 'bout you baby can't you see?\n\nIf feel delighted if you will come with me\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love up and above the clouds\n\nThe only way to fly is on the wings of love\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love only the two of us\n\nTogether flying high\n\nFlying high upon the wings of love\n\n\n\nYes, you belong to me\n\nAnd I'm yours exclusively\n\nRight now we live and breathe each other\n\nInseparable it seems\n\n\n\nWhat love, when like a stream running, free travelling on the wings of love\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love up and above the clouds\n\nThe only way to fly is on the wings of love\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love only the two of us\n\nTogether flying high together flying high\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love up and above the clouds\n\nThe only way to fly is on the wings of love\n\n\n\nOn the wings of love only the two of us\n\nTogether flying high together flying high\n\n\n\nFlying high upon the wings of love of love"
