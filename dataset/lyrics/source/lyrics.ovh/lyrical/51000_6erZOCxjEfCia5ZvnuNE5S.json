I'm walking down your road again\r\nThere's something that I wanna say to you right now if it's alright\r\nMy mistakes are suddenly keeping me awake\r\nDancing around on memory lane, it's driving me insane\r\nI won't lose you like I used to before\n\nAnd I'm gonna choose to be around a little bit more\n\nI promise you that\n\nYeah, I promise you that, I promise you that\n\n\n\nI lay down my weapons\n\nI can't fight it anymore\n\nI'm not a one-man army\n\nSo I'm coming around for you if it's alright\n\n\n\nI won't lose you like I used to before\n\nAnd I'm gonna choose to be around a little bit more\n\nI promise you that\n\nYeah, I promise you that, I promise you that\n\n\n\n\n\nI won't lose you like I used to before\n\nAnd I'm gonna choose to be around a little bit more\n\nI promise you that\n\nYeah, I promise you that, I promise you that"
