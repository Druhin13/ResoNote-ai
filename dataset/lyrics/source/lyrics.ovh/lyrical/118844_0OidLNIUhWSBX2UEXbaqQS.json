  "lyrics": "Oh\r\nVivid visions of us carry on\r\nThink I found the light it's been so long\r\nI better hold on to this feeling before it's gone\r\nWhatever happened we both grew as time moved on\n\nOh-oh\n\n\n\nFeels like I'm the only one\n\nLooking at blue skies, dreaming of old times\n\nBrighter days will come\n\nLooking at blue skies, with you in my mind\n\nI'm the only one, brighter days will come\n\nAm I the only one?\n\nLooking at blue skies, dreaming of old times\n\n\n\nDreaming of old times\n\nDreaming of old times\n\n\n\nFlying higher, I'm ten feet off the ground (off the ground)\n\nI see it all even when looking down\n\nDon't wanna hold on to the times you were around\n\nNo longer hear you voice when there's no single sound\n\n\n\nFeels like I'm the only one\n\nLooking at blue skies, dreaming of old times\n\nBrighter days will come\n\nLooking at blue skies, with you in my mind\n\nI'm the only one, brighter days will come\n\nAm I the only one?\n\nLooking at blue skies, dreaming of old times\n\n\n\nDreaming of old times\n\nBrighter days will come\n\n\n\nBrighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will\n\nBrighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will\n\nBrighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will\n\nBrighter days, ter days, ter days, ter days will\n\nBrighter days will come"
