  "lyrics": "I don't drive Topanga anymore\r\n’Cause it reminds me of you\r\nSaid we'd buy a big house there someday\r\nBut we never got to\r\n'Cause you, and me, and life got in the way\r\nI can’t drive Topanga home today\n\n\n\nI can't wash with that soap anymore\n\nBecause it just smells just like you\n\nAnd I still got your shirts tucked in the drawer\n\nBecause they smell just like you\n\nHopes, and dreams, and the promises we made\n\nDown the drain, they all got washed away\n\n\n\nFunny how, we're strangers now, and we're different\n\nAnd the strengths of time could turn sweet love to indifference\n\nYa I guessed we lied when you and I said \"We will try to focus on forgiveness\"\n\nAnd I can't forget it\n\n\n\nOne of our friends say you got a girl\n\nAnd that she looks just like me\n\nCalabasas, too small of a world\n\nBut I don't wanna see it\n\nSo I'll stay inside where I know that I'm safe\n\n’Cause you only live a couple miles away\n\n\n\nI don’t drive Topanga anymore\n\n'Cause it reminds me of you\n\nSmoking and singing love songs in the garden\n\nLike we always used to\n\nAnd I drive by, I turn my eyes and hide\n\n’Cause when I pass Topanga, now I cry\n\n'Cause Topanga just reminds me of you and I\n\nYeah, tears fall, Topanga in my mind\n\nTears fall, Topanga in my mind\n\nTopanga in my mind"
