  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Dirty Cigarettes par Beach Slang\r\nI write a lot, it's mostly lies\nI fall in love to pass the time\nI never fit, I never tried\nI need the struggle to feel alive\n\nAll I want are records on my stereo\nI'm better off, baby, when I'm all alone, that's a lie\nDirty cigarettes and a dirty soul\nTell me I'm enough, I am dying to know what it's like\nThis sound is fucked, but I don't mind\nIt's wrong enough to feel alright\nI think a lot, like all the time\nI get in trouble when things get quiet\n\n\nAll I want are records on my stereo\nI'm better off, baby, when I'm all alone, that's a lie\nDirty cigarettes and a dirty soul\nTell me I'm enough, I am dying to know what it's like"
