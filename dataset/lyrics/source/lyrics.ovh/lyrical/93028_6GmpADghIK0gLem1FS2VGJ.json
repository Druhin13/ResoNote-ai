  "lyrics": "One, two, a-one, two, three, four\r\nWas it a dream?\r\nUnder the holy cross in the valley below\r\nA mother and child emergency\r\nBehind a yellow curtain on the second floor\n\nAll the guardian angels at the door\n\nWith their long white coats and their stethoscopes\n\n\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm the little white dove\n\nI'm the heroine\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm a little white dove, yeah\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm a little white dove, yeah\n\n\n\nWas it a dream?\n\nWhen you called me kitten and her majesty\n\nI'm your blood, I want more\n\nThe water from my eyes fell to the floor\n\n\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm the little white dove, yeah\n\nI'm the heroine\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm a little white dove, yeah\n\n\n\nHungry eyes watching over you\n\nPetty crimes are the family jewels\n\nWe're living our lives\n\nAnd it's happening over and over again (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\n\n\nWas it a dream?\n\nUnder the holy cross in the valley below\n\nA mother and child, eternity\n\nUnder a cool white sheet, here we go\n\n\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm a little white dove, yeah\n\nI'm the heroine\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm a little white dove\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nI'm a little white dove\n\n\n\nIn the middle of love\n\nIn the middle of love"
