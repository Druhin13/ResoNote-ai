  "lyrics": "Believe me, I'm speechless\r\nI wish that I could say those words\r\nYou whispered so sweetly\r\nAnd maybe I'll regret this but I've gotta be honest\r\nCause we made a promise, I won't break it now\r\nI wish I could hold you\n\nBut how could I be so unfair to lead us to nowhere?\n\nWe've both been down that road before\n\nAnd if it should end us please know that I'm helpless\n\nI've made up my mind\n\n\n\nIt's not that I don't care the way that you do\n\nIt's just my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor somebody new\n\nIt's not that I don't feel the feelings you do\n\nIt's just my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor somebody new\n\n\n\nIf only this started when love was something new to me\n\nI'd never have questioned\n\nRejecting what we could have been\n\nBut when you've been broken\n\nSome wounds remain open\n\nThat no one can heal\n\n\n\nIt's not that I don't care the way that you do\n\nIt's just my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor somebody new\n\nIt's not that I don't feel the feelings you do\n\nIt's just my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor somebody new\n\n\n\nIt's not that I don't feel, the feelings you do\n\nIt's just my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor somebody new\n\nIt's not that I don't-\n\nIt's not that I don't care the way that you do\n\nThe way that you do, babe\n\nCause when my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor something so soon, yeah\n\nIt's just my heart's not ready yet\n\nFor somebody new"
