  "lyrics": "We were staying home to get away\r\nTrying to loose through the hole but it's still too late\r\nDon't sigh on me, don't size me up at all\r\nWe were backing off with a bellyache\r\nYou can sit in a hole, you can save your believe\n\nI'm in awe, I'm forgetting everything\n\n\n\nWell don't corner me\n\nYou've got nerve to be\n\nGoddamn, your broke feeling's such a foolish thing\n\nSee it's good to be out and alone in the world\n\nCause nobody cares, and they never did anyway\n\n\n\nYou can pack that notion, air and hate\n\nYou can black my face, you can bury me\n\nI'm one on all\n\nI'm one on every side\n\n\n\nWe were spinning in, we were out of date\n\nYou been giving it hell or so you think\n\nI'm barreling in, I'm barely at all\n\n\n\nWhoo!\n\n\n\nYou think it's a funny thing\n\nYou think it's sex all day\n\nGoddamn ya, goddamn ya\n\nIt's got all of me, or at least the teeth\n\nIt don't bother me, it don't bother me\n\n\n\nSee it's good to be out and alone in the world\n\nCause nobody cares, and they never did anyways"
