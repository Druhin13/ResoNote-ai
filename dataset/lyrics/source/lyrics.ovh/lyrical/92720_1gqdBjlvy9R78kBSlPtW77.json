Time to send out the call to arms. Leeries, trip the lights and lead the way!\n\nNow when you're stuck in the mist, sure\nYou can struggle and resist or\nYou can trip a little light fantastic with me\nNow say you're lost in the crowd, well\nYou can stamp and scream out loud or\nYou can trip a little light fantastic with me\n\nAnd when the fog comes rolling in, just\nKeep your feet upon the path\nMustn't mope and frown or worse, lie down\n\nDon't let it be your epitaph\n\nSo when life is getting scary, be your own illuminary\nWho can shine their light for all the world to see\nAs you trip a little light fantastic with me\n\nA leerie loves the edge of night\nThough dim, to him the world looks bright\nHe's got the gift of second sight\n\n[LEERIES]\nTo trip a little light fantastic!\n\n[JACK]\nA leerie's job's to light the way\n\n\n[LEERIES]\nTo take the night and make it day\n\n[JACK]\nWe mimic the moon, yes that's our aim\n\n[JACK and LEERIES]\nFor we're the keepers of the flame\n\n[JACK]\nAnd if you're deep inside a tunnel\nWhen there is no end in sight\nWell just carry on until the dawn\nIt's darkest right before the light\n\nAs you trip a little light fantastic\nWon't you trip a little light fantastic\nCome on, trip a little light fantastic with me\n\n\n[instrumental]\n(Oy! Oy! Oy!)\n\n[ANGUS]\nCome along, join us in a bit of a kick and prance\n\n[JOHN]\nWhat did he say?\n\n[JACK]\nKick and prance -- it means \"dance\"! It's leerie speak. You don't say the words you mean, you say something that rhymes, only -- here, I'll show you how it works. Angus, give us your weep and wail. To the rest of ya, that means\"tale\"\n\n[ANGUS]\n\nI was short of a sheet\n\n[JACK]\nIt was in the street\n\n[ANGUS]\nJust a tumble down a sink\n\n[JACK]\nJust to get himself a drink\n\n[ANGUS]\nThen I pinch what's fatter\n\n[JACK]\nHe grabbed his ladder\n\n[ANGUS]\n\nTo smile and smirk-\n\n[JACK and ANGUS]\nTo work!\n\n[JACK]\nYou see, there's nothing to it\n\n[ANNABEL]\nCan you speak leerie, Mary Poppins?\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nCan I speak leerie?\n\n[JACK]\nOf course she can. She's Mary Poppins!\n\n[GEORGIE]\n\nCan we do it with you?\n\n[JOHN and ANNABEL]\nPlease?\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nOh, very well then\n\n[JACK]\nChildren, tell us yer sorry tale\n\n[LEERIES]\nGive us your weep and wail!\n\n[JOHN]\nWell, we had this bowl\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\n\nRabbit in the hole\n\n[ANNABEL]\nThat fell and broke\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nBicycle spoke\n\n[JOHN]\nSo we took it to a shop\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nLike a lollipop\n\n[GEORGIE]\nAnd went upside down!\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nThat's a circus clown\n\n[JOHN]\nThen went to the bank\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nRattle and clank\n\n[ANNABEL]\nGot lost in the fog\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nLump on a log\n\n[JOHN]\nTill we found a friend\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nTo stand and defend\n\n[ANNABEL]\nWho took us on a trip\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nSnapped a horse's whip\n\n[CHILDREN]\nAnd we tripped a little light fantastic!\n\n[MARY POPPINS]\nNow that sounds a little bit bombastic\n\n[JACK]\nBut they tripped the light-\n\n[CHILDREN]\nWe tripped a light!\n\n[ALL]\nLet's trip a little light fantastic!\n\n[instrumental]\n\n[LEERIES]\nJoin us, Mary Poppins!\nHey!\n\n[instrumental]\n\n[JACK]\n(spoken) You've got it-\nNow let's get you all back home!\n\n[ALL]\nNow if your life is getting foggy\nThat's no reason to complain\n\n[JACK]\nThere's so much in store, inside the door\n\n[ALL]\nOf 17 Cherry Tree Lane\n\n[JACK]\nSo when troubles are incessant\nSimply be more incandescent\nFor your light comes with a lifetime guarantee\nAs you-\n\n[ALL]\nTrip a little light fantastic\n\n[JACK]\nWon't you-\n\n[ALL]\nTrip a little light fantastic\n\n[JACK]\nCome on!\n\n[ALL]\nTrip a little light fantastic\n\n[JACK]\nWith me!\n\n[CHILDREN and LEERIES]\nWent to the bank! Rattle and clank!\nMet with the boss! Pitch and toss!\nGot lost in the fog! Lump on a log!\n\n[ALL]\nTrip a little light fantastic!"
