  "lyrics": "I want you close to me\r\nI want you close, I want you closer\r\nBut when you're here with me\r\nIt's hard to tell just what you're after\r\nYou say, you want all of me today\n\nBut tomorrow's not the same\n\nMy feelings never change\n\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nWhat do you want? Uh\n\n\n\nI need to know\n\nIf this is mutual\n\nBefore I go\n\nAnd get way too involved\n\nI want you bad\n\nCan you reciprocate?\n\nNo, I don't want to have to leave\n\nBut half of you is not enough for me\n\n\n\nThis inconsistency\n\nWhat does it mean you got me questioning?\n\nThe way you act and take it back, do I mean anything?\n\nJust tell me honestly\n\n\n\nYou say, you want all of me today\n\nBut tomorrow's not the same\n\nMy feelings never change\n\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nWhat do you want? Uh\n\n\n\nI need to know\n\nIf this is mutual\n\nBefore I go\n\nAnd get way too involved\n\nI want you bad\n\nCan you reciprocate?\n\nNo, I don't want to have to leave\n\nBut half of you is not enough for me\n\n\n\nAre you playing me\n\nIs this a game?\n\nWhen you show up late\n\nSay love at 2 am\n\nThen tell me you can't stay\n\nGirl, yeah\n\nWhat do you want from me?\n\n\n\nBaby ohhh, I need to know\n\nIf this is mutual\n\nBefore I go\n\nAnd get way too involved\n\nI want you bad, baby\n\nCan you reciprocate?\n\nNo, I don't want to have to leave\n\nBut half of you's not enough for me"
