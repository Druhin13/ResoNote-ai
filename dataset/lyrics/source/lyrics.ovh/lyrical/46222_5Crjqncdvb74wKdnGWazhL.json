  "lyrics": "Lucky, catching my reflection, while the world keeps flying past\r\nWindow shopping for some confidence\r\nLooking for the woman in this girl\r\nAin't no normal in this world\r\nGot an education, feel like an educated fool\n\nI didn't ask the questions I should have in school\n\nSome lessons take some time to learn\n\nAin't no normal in this world\n\n\n\nAnd it's hard to find the path your feet should follow\n\nIt's enough to leave you emptied out and hollow\n\nAnd they tell you, \"Here's the truth you need to swallow\"\n\nThen they put you on a Tilt-A-Whirl\n\nThere ain't no normal in this world\n\n\n\nYou act like you have faith and you know what you believe in\n\nBut the part of you you hate\n\nIs the one that keeps on living\n\nLike a broken string with a strand of pearls\n\nAin't no normal in this world\n\n\n\nAnd it's hard to find the path your feet should follow\n\nIt's enough to leave you emptied out and hollow\n\nAnd they tell you, \"Here's the truth you need to swallow\"\n\nThen they put you on a Tilt-A-Whirl\n\nThere ain't no normal in this world\n\n\n\nAnd it's hard to find the path your feet should follow\n\nIt's enough to leave you emptied out and hollow\n\nAnd they tell you, \"Here's the truth you need to swallow\"\n\nThen they put you on a Tilt-A-Whirl\n\nThere ain't no normal in this world\n\n\n\nOh, you can pray for the waves to die\n\nOr just decide to ride the girl\n\nThere ain't no normal in this world"
