I already knew what was comin' to him. I got two more boys, I gotta come do the same thing two more years. The Big Baller way. Ball control. I'll have another hat on, to say I told you so\n\nThanks a lot LaVar, congrats\n\nThank you\n\n\n\nPrayin' 'cause I know I'm blessed\n\nI just wish y'all loved more and you hated less\n\nTryna be a good person and I try my best\n\nBut I don't always do right sometimes I turn left\n\nBut it's cool 'cause I live and learn\n\nJohn Austin Milan, JAM, shout out Yerm\n\nI'm speakin' that real, not just sayin' some words\n\nI ate Free Smoke, wanted seconds and thirds\n\nRIP my brother Nnam, may he rest in peace\n\nTook my brother 'fore I had a chance to tell him peace\n\nI used to cry until I had to realize\n\nIt's not gon' bring him back, so as a man I had to wipe my eyes\n\nClose 'em tight and pray to Christ\n\nSay him in and spread the light\n\nI love my bro, he not in sight\n\nBut in my heart I hold him tight\n\nLookin' up to heaven, prayin' every night\n\nJesus died for our sins, we gon' be alright"
