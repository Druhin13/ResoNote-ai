I can't decide\nI want to, but a bitch got pride\nThe switchin' up shit is what I can't fuck with\nI'm feelin' you but you hard to get in touch with\nAnd you ain't hit me up in a while\n\nActin' like you don't know what number to dial\nYou quit, then that's it, I'ma throw in the towel\n'Cause a nigga only goin' through what you allow\nYou don't want this gun smoke\nLearn to text, but you know so your thumb broke\nI don't care if we gettin' to it and I stall on your ass\nBut I still wake up from missed calls from your ass, nigga\n\n[Kehlani]\nYou don't hit my line no more, oh, oh\nYou don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring\nI can't keep this on the low\nI want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring\n\n[Cardi B]\nNah, nigga now you gon' have to call me (call me)\n\n'Cause I'm lookin' at these messages, they on me (yeah)\nActin' like they ain't niggas that want me\nLet another nigga in your spot, and you gon' be hot, nigga, coffee\nYou gon' be sick to your stomach\nHit me when you free, when they 100\nIt's emergency, call me 911\n'Cause right now I'm out here tryna find someone\nSo the ring on my phone, ring on my finger (brrr)\nYou actin' like you ain't tryna do either (yeah)\nWhat's a good girl? Watch me turn diva\nHere goes my heart, I put it on speaker (oh)\n\n[Kehlani]\nYou don't hit my line no more, oh, oh\nYou don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring\nI can't keep this on the low\n\nI want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring\n\n[ Kehlani]\nYou used to be on my line\nOn my tick all the time, yeah\nLove it when you make me feel\nLike you don't mind when I ain't got time for you\nYou know it don't go to my head\nI'm only here again in bed\nI just love to know you wanna spend time with me and shit\nNow you all caught up\nYeah, you all caught up\nNow you done left me alone, yeah\nYou was all fed up\nReady for the next step\nWanna be on your own\nSaid I just miss you, I just miss us, baby\n\nAll I know is\n\n[Kehlani]\nYou don't hit my line no more, oh, oh\nYou don't make it ring, ring, ring, ring (you don't make it ring, baby)\nI can't keep this on the low (yeah, yeah, oh)\nI want you to make it ring, ring, ring, ring"
