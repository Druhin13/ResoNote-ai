  "lyrics": "The silence I hear when you escape\r\nYour eyes are echoing my name\r\nThe dust I left, your saint is chasing\r\nYour eyes are echoing my name\r\nYour eyes are echoing my name\n\nMysteriously, I still like hearing\n\nYour eyes echoing my name\n\nThe rabbit can't dictate the way\n\nWith your eyes echoing my name\n\nYour eyes are echoing my name\n\n\n\nMeaning no harm, I keep trying\n\nTo find you uptown\n\nWhy when love isn't sticky enough it stays\n\nHitting you for so long\n\nYou say what you want, I keep trying\n\nTo find you uptown\n\nEven if love did crush us down\n\nSometimes I miss having you around\n\n\n\nNo, I won't leave, don't blame me if\n\nYour eyes are echoing my name\n\nI bet your maze betrays your faith when\n\nYour eyes are echoing my name\n\nYour eyes are echoing my name\n\n\n\nBehinds the scenes I wonder\n\nAre your eyes echoing my name\n\nThe lighthouse turned from red to white again\n\nStill echoing my name\n\nYour eyes are echoing my name\n\n\n\nMeaning no harm, I keep trying\n\nTo find you uptown\n\nWhy when love isn't sticky enough it stays\n\nHitting you for so long\n\nYou say what you want, I keep trying\n\nTo find you uptown\n\nEven if love did crush us down\n\nSometimes I miss having you around\n\n\n\nYou say what you want, I keep trying\n\nTo find you uptown\n\nEven if love did crush us down\n\nSometimes I miss having you around"
