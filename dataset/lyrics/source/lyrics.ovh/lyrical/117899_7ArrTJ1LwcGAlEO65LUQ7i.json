  "lyrics": "I used to love these sheets\r\nDark hair against the white\r\nI missed watching you get dressed in a hazy bedroom light\r\nIt took a couple weeks\r\nLast night I finally cried\r\nI remember us in London\n\nYour chocolate covered eyes\n\n\n\nSick of staring up at the ceiling\n\nHow’d you change your mind just like that\n\nThe only way to get past this feeling is to tell myself you’re not coming back\n\n\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nFrom the start, I never thought I’d say this before\n\nBut I don’t wanna love you anymore\n\n\n\nYou got that letter framed\n\nIs it still up in your shelf\n\nIt’s the one I left on our bed when you were out of town\n\n\n\nSick of staring up at the ceiling\n\nHow’d you change your mind just like that\n\nThe only way to get past this feeling is to tell myself you’re not coming back\n\n\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nFrom the start, I never thought I’d say this before\n\nBut I don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI can’t forget the way it felt when you walked out the door\n\nBut I don’t wanna love you anymore\n\n\n\nSometimes I just wanna talk for a minute but I can’t bring myself to call\n\nBecause I know that your heart’s not really in it\n\nAnd whatever we had is gone\n\nSometimes I just wanna talk for a minute but I can’t bring myself to call\n\nBecause I know that your heart’s not really in it\n\nAnd whatever we had is gone\n\n\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nFrom the start, I never thought I’d say this before\n\nBut I don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI don’t wanna love you anymore\n\nI can’t forget the way it felt when you walked out the door\n\nBut I don’t wanna love you anymore"
