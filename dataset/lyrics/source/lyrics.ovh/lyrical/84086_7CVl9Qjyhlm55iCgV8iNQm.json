  "lyrics": "There's something special, \nAbout six o'clock in the morning,\r\nWhen it's still too early to knock,\r\nAnd the dusty light, \nShines down on the block,\r\nAnd reflects up and down, \n\nOn the hands of the clock,\n\nAt six o'clock, six o'clock.\n\nA few hours ago she was standing here,\n\nJust watching the stars in our eyes,\n\nAnd the lights as the tides disappear.\n\nAnd I could feel I could say what I want,\n\nThat I could nudge her, \n\nAnd call her my confidant,\n\nAnd now I'm back alone, \n\nWith just my shadow and frown,\n\nAt six o'clock, six o'clock.\n\nI went home and found, \n\nThat trying to sleep was a laugh,\n\nJust watching my eyelids, \n\nKnowing my brain bits the night, \n\nNot the past,\n\nI got up and got scuffling around,\n\nBut somehow, \n\nIt just wasn't the same happy town,\n\nAnd the bells didn't ring, \n\nWith the same happy sound,\n\nAt six o'clock, six o'clock.\n\nIf I go back where we parted,\n\nCould I ever feel like that again?\n\nGuess I'll just have to wait â??til tomorrow,\n\nBut what can I do â??til then?\n\nGuess I'll go back home, \n\nAnd just wait until dawn,\n\nGuess I had to learn going back, \n\nWhere we were wouldn't help at all.\n\nAnd I wish my head, \n\nHad been working right,\n\nWe'd have gone for coffee, \n\nAnd talked all night,\n\nBut now I'm back alone, \n\nGetting twisted uptight,\n\nAt six o'clock, six o'clock.\n\nNow, I'm back alone,\n\nYes, I'm back alone,\n\nI'm back alone..."
