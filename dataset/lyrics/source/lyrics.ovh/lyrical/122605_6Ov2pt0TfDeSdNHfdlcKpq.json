  "lyrics": "She’s headed to west in an airplane\r\nCareless with my heart in a carry-on\r\nI’m trying to forget her\r\nI’m trying to forget her\r\nI bet she’s in a beach chair somewhere\n\nBreaking new hearts by the poolside\n\nI’m trying to forget her\n\nI’m trying, I’m trying\n\n\n\nWell it’s the second day of summer\n\nYou already got me sweating about it\n\nOh it’s second night of summer\n\nAnd I’m disintegrating without you\n\n\n\nThrowing me that shade like I’m not cool enough\n\n\n\nShe’s always had a soul like cellophane\n\nWalked right through me like a spring rain\n\nI’m trying to forget her\n\nI’m trying to forget\n\n\n\nShe’s always running from her troubles\n\nThe trouble is I love her\n\nWon’t ever love another one cold as her\n\nI’m trying to forget her\n\nI’m trying, I’m trying\n\n\n\nSun up and sun down\n\nSun up and sun down\n\n\n\nThrowing me that shade like I’m not cool enough"
