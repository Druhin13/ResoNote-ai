  "lyrics": "You know we've been fooled\r\nGo bring the tears in night\r\nDon't know if I'll see the morning light\r\nIt's hard to resist then when he was here\r\nEasy to, easy to get swept in\r\nI found my place in the great design\n\nNow I see the way that the humble ride\n\nIt's hard to know you're low when you think you're high\n\nHard to see the way in the reckless life\n\n\n\nWe're living in a f*cked up paradise\n\nHate to say I've been fooled all this time\n\nIf I don't get out of here alive\n\nAt least you know is, oh, I really tried\n\nGo ahead and take your aim\n\nI refuse to fight your war\n\nGo and win the bets you made\n\nNothing scares me anymore\n\nNothing scares me anymore\n\n\n\nNothing scaring, nothing scaring me\n\nNothing scaring, nothing scaring me\n\nNothing scaring, nothing scaring me\n\nNothing scares me anymore\n\n\n\nLife, life\n\n\n\nWe're living in a f*cked up paradise\n\nHate to say I've been fooled all this time\n\nIf I don't get out of here alive\n\nAt least you know is, oh, I really tried\n\nGo ahead and take your aim\n\nI refuse to fight your war\n\nGo and win the bets you made\n\nNothing scares me anymore\n\nNothing scares me anymore\n\n\n\nNothing scaring, nothing scaring me\n\nNothing scaring, nothing scaring me\n\nNothing scaring, nothing scaring me\n\nNothing scares me anymore"
