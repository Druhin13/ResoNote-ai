  "lyrics": "Everything I say only seems to complicate it\r\nEvery other fight is just another night wasted\r\nAre we gonna lose?\r\nIs this gonna last?\r\nWorry about the future, worry about the past\r\nThink we're gonna break before I get a chance to say this\n\nDon't wanna live without you\n\n\n\nStaring in your eyes, everything simplifies\n\nLeave it all behind, everything simplifies\n\nAll we need is nothing more (when everything simplifies)\n\nYou and I need nothing more, everything simplifies\n\n\n\nStressing over this, stressing over that, we're falling\n\nLike the whole world is banging on the door I'm calling\n\nAre we gonna lose?\n\nIs it gonna last?\n\nWorry about the future, worry about the past\n\nFilter out the noise, focus on my voice and fall in\n\n\n\nStaring in your eyes, everything simplifies\n\nLeave it all behind, everything simplifies\n\nAll we need is nothing more (when everything simplifies)\n\nYou and I need nothing more, everything simplifies\n\n\n\nWhy must we complicate\n\nEvery breath we take?\n\nWhy can't you see we'll be alright?\n\n\n\nNothing disappears\n\nEven the pain we've been through\n\nBut all I need is here\n\nDon't wanna live without you\n\n\n\nAll we need is nothing more (when everything simplifies)\n\nYou and I need nothing more, everything simplifies"
