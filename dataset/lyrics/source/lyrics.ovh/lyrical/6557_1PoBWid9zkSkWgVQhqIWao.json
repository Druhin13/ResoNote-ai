  "lyrics": "A million stories that Your love inspires\r\nEvery star above me that You brought to life\r\nI'll never comprehend the good that You provide\r\nAnd time and time again the number climbs\r\n'Cause I, know You never left my side\n\nI try to count the blessings\n\nI, I could never count that high\n\nI could never count that high\n\n\n\nA million memories that I can't ignore\n\nHow You met all of my needs and then You gave me more\n\nAnd on and on You love beyond my wildest dreams\n\nAnd time and time again You give to me\n\n\n\n'Cause I, know You never left my side\n\nI try to count the blessings\n\nI, I could never count that high\n\nI could never count that high\n\n\n\nAnd every time that I try to add it up\n\nAnd I'm not even close\n\nThe more that I try, the more that it chokes me up\n\n'Cause I'm not even close\n\n\n\n'Cause I, know You never left my side\n\nI try to count the blessings\n\nI, I could never count that high\n\nI could never count that high\n\n'Cause I, know You never left my side\n\nI try to count the blessings\n\nI, I could never count that high\n\nI could never count that high\n\n\n\nI could never count that high"
