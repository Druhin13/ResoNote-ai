  "lyrics": "I'm trying not to pretend that it won't happen again and again like that\r\nNever thought it would end cause you got up in my head and my head like that\r\nAnd made me happy baby love is crazy so amazing\r\nBut it's changing, rearranging\r\nI don't think I can take anymore\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nCause the walls burned up and our love fell down\n\nAnd it turned into whatever now we're saying never\n\nFeel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning\n\nFor forever and always\n\nWe gotta let it go the other be on our way\n\nLook for another day, cause it ain't the same my baby\n\nWatch it all fall into the ground\n\nNo happy ever after, just disaster\n\n\n\nDidn't want it this way I only wanted to say\n\nI loved you right\n\nNow you're walking away and leaving me here to stay\n\n... Wait for you to realise\n\nAll the things I gave you, made you change you\n\nYour dreams came true\n\nWhen I met you, now forget you\n\nDon't want anymore\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nCause the walls burned up and our love fell down\n\nAnd it turned into whatever now we're saying never\n\nFeel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning\n\nFor forever and always\n\nWe gotta let it go the other be on our way\n\nLook for another day, cause it ain't the same my baby\n\nWatch it all fall into the ground\n\nNo happy ever after, just disaster\n\n\n\nYou shot the bullet, you shot the bullet that killed me\n\nNot feeling my heart beat, and now we're dying\n\nI I'm through it, I I'm through all the agony\n\nAnd now my eyes are, trying, trying no more crying,\n\nLying it's just a game,\n\n... And I'm all right cause my love's on his way\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah yeah\n\nBurning up for forever and always, always\n\nYeah yeah yeah\n\n\n\n[Chorus: x2]\n\nCause the walls burned up and our love fell down\n\nAnd it turned into whatever now we're saying never\n\nFeel the fire cause it's all around and it's burning\n\nFor forever and always\n\nWe gotta let it go the other be on our way\n\nLook for another day, cause it ain't the same my baby\n\nWatch it all fall into the ground\n\nNo happy ever after, just disaster"
