  "lyrics": "I will break with you\r\nFor your body to be freed\r\nNot pleased\r\nTake the weight of you\r\nFor your gravity to be erased\r\nJust a phantom muse\n\nWhat was the form, the flesh, the feet, the face?\n\n\n\nCome to life, my hungry arms are begging you\n\nBut what more can you do?\n\n\n\nLabor reveal\n\nBefore our eyes, into our ears\n\nUnfurl with light\n\nThe stars around us disappear\n\nJust what is torn\n\nWhat comes alive inside of us\n\n\n\nLabor reveal\n\nBefore our eyes, into our ears\n\nUnfurl with light\n\nThe stars around us disappear\n\nJust what is torn\n\nWhat comes to life inside of us\n\n\n\nCome to, come to, come to life, come to"
