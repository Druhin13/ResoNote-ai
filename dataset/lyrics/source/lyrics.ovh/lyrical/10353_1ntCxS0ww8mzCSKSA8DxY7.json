  "lyrics": "Take a second to reflect on your reflection in the mirror looking back at you\r\nTake a moment to forget what you've been told and just remember what your heart says too\r\nReconsider that your mind is so much bigger\r\nAnd the picture's never been more clear, no\r\nAnd when your spirit feels like it's disappearing\r\nWell i hope that you can hear it saying\n\n\n\nBaby change is coming\n\nGot peace and love in the oven\n\nJust mix that sin with cinnamon in\n\nWe're free like the fourth of July\n\nTell darkness keep on running\n\nThe clouds will part and let the sun in\n\nOpen your heart and let someone in\n\nIt's easy like apple pie\n\n\n\nTake a second to look in the right direction\n\nCause we're headed for a brand new day\n\nTake a minute just be careful how you spend it\n\nBecause karma has a pretty large price to pay\n\nAnd change don't come easy\n\nIf we want to be free\n\nI need you, you need me\n\nTogether completely\n\nDon't have to agree\n\nWe've got love that's all we need\n\nHoney please believe me that\n\n\n\nBaby change is coming\n\nGot peace and love in the oven\n\nJust mix that sin with cinnamon in\n\nWe're free like the fourth of July\n\nTell darkness keep on running\n\nThe clouds will part and let the sun in\n\nOpen your heart and let someone in\n\nIt's easy like apple pie\n\nIt's easy like apple pie\n\nEasy like, easy like apple pie\n\nEasy like apple pie\n\nIt's easy like\n\nIt's easy like apple pie\n\nEasy like Sunday morning\n\nOh when the storm ends\n\n\n\nBaby change is coming\n\nGot peace and love in the oven\n\nJust mix that sin with cinnamon in\n\nWe're free like the fourth of July\n\nTell darkness keep on running\n\nThe clouds will part and let the sun in\n\nOpen your heart and let someone in\n\nIt's easy like apple pie\n\nIt's easy like, it could be easy like apple pie\n\nEasy like apple pie\n\nIt's easy like apple pie"
