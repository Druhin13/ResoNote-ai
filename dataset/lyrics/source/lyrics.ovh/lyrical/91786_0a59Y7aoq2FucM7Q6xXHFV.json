  "lyrics": "I walked right through the door\r\nYou said we need to talk\r\nSo I'm just asking\r\nAre we gon' be okay?\r\nWe had our ups and downs\r\nSaid things we weren't so proud\n\nBut I'm just asking\n\nIs this the end of us?\n\n\n\nRemember you said it's do or die?\n\n'Cause no one has made you this happy\n\nRemember you said this could be for life?\n\n\n\nWish we could love like the old days\n\nWhen we never used to give a fuck\n\nAnd I could love you the same way\n\nLike I did when we were outta luck\n\nSo let's stay away from the present, babe\n\nJust like the old days\n\n\n\nI walked straight out the door\n\nCouldn't take this no more\n\nYou see me trying but you don't try at all\n\nHow did we end up here?\n\nDried up from all the tears\n\nWhen you could see that\n\nThis might be ending us\n\n\n\nRemember you said it's do or die?\n\n'Cause no one has made you this happy\n\nRemember you said this could be for life?\n\n\n\nWish we could love like the old days\n\nWhen we never used to give a fuck\n\nAnd I could love you the same way\n\nLike I did when we were outta luck\n\nSo let's stay away from the present, babe\n\nJust like the old days\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember you said this is do or die?\n\n'Cause no one has made you this happy\n\nRemember you said this could be for life?\n\n\n\nWish we could love like the old days\n\nWhen we never used to give a fuck\n\nAnd I could love you the same way\n\nLike I did when we were outta luck\n\nSo let's stay away from the present, babe\n\nJust like the old days"
