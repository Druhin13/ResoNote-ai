  "lyrics": "Do you ever look back to the time I said it was over?\r\n'Cause I do\r\n'Cause lately I was thinking I could've fought for us a little harder\r\nNow someone's enjoying what I would brush off\r\nHe's filling the spaces where I came off short\n\nI shouldn't be watching\n\nI can't ignore that smile that he gives you\n\nSomething that I never saw\n\n\n\nWe're worlds apart, now I feel helpless\n\nI cut you off but I'm still selfish\n\nIt's hard to watch you being someone else's\n\nI never thought, never thought that I'd be jealous\n\n\n\nOh, if I could rewind I would give myself more patience\n\nStill would be you and me if I believed in second chances\n\n\n\nNow someone's enjoying what I would brush off\n\nHe's filling the spaces where I came off short\n\nI shouldn't be watching\n\nI can't ignore that smile that he gives you\n\nSomething that I never saw\n\n\n\nWe're worlds apart, now I feel helpless\n\nI cut you off but I'm still selfish\n\nIt's hard to watch you being someone else's\n\nI never thought, never thought that I'd be jealous\n\nBut you got me jealous\n\nYou got me jealous, you got me jealous\n\n\n\nIf it's what you want now you know it's working\n\nI thought I moved on, oh, how I was mistaken\n\nI shouldn't be watching\n\nI can't ignore that smile that he gives you\n\nSomething that I never saw\n\n\n\nWe're worlds apart, now I feel helpless\n\nI cut you off but I'm still selfish\n\nIt's hard to watch you being someone else's\n\nI never thought, never thought that I'd be jealous, oh\n\nBut you got me jealous, oh you got me\n\nYou got me jealous, you got me jealous"
