  "lyrics": "In the west shall rise\r\nA sinister creed\r\nThe rich will get what they want\r\nThe poor will lose what they need\r\nThe devil knows our fears\n\nHe told all his friends\n\nThey'll block the sun with their lies\n\nAs darkness descends\n\n\n\nOh Lord, the great collapse\n\nWon't be our end\n\nWhen the world falls into the flames\n\nWe will rise again\n\nWe will rise again\n\n\n\nLet the wars begin\n\nWe'll keep our pistols near\n\nOur neighbors, frail and thin\n\nAs they disappear\n\n\n\nLet the chaos come\n\nLet our houses freeze\n\nThe lights will all go out\n\nBut we'll finally see\n\n\n\nOh Lord, the great collapse\n\nWon't be our end\n\nWhen the world falls into the flames\n\nWe will rise again\n\nWe will rise again\n\n\n\nWhen the sky has cleared\n\nAnd the storm has passed\n\nWe'll walk arm in arm\n\nDown our promised path\n\n\n\nWe'll watch the sun come up\n\nFrom its bed of black\n\nWe'll enter Eden's Garden\n\nAnd never look back\n\n\n\nOh Lord, the great collapse\n\nWon't be our end\n\nWhen the world falls into the flames\n\nWe will rise again\n\nWe will rise again"
