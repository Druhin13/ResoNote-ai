  "lyrics": "There's so much more to the world today\r\nFor whatever reason we all get to have our say\r\nBut respect for which everybody pays (?)\r\nIs hard to find with people so concerned with what's between our legs\r\nNow in the past I've caused confusion, it's true\n\nBut what's the fun of living life pink or blue?\n\nI say just tell 'em all to shut up and just be you\n\n\n\nNow when I'm at the movies, and I'm standing in line\n\nI might hear some guy shout out saying 'Girl, you look fine'\n\nWell I may think it's rude, but that old attitude makes me laugh\n\nOr if i'm on the phone, and i'm talking so bold\n\nAnd that operator says to me 'Ma'am, please hold'\n\nWell I know it's my voice, it's never been a choice for me\n\n\n\nWell (?) I may sound like a dame, and my curves make 'em cry\n\nBut there is more man to me than meets the eye\n\nNo I'm not either or, what a bore, I'm just me\n\n\n\nNow when I'm at the doctor, for little old check up\n\nAnd he says I've marked the wrong box and I wanna yell 'Step up!'\n\nWell I take it in stride (?), it won't change what's inside of me\n\nOr if i'm at airport security, and they send in some chick\n\nTo start pattin' me down until she notices my dic-tion and my grammar correct, I am what I elect to be\n\n\n\nWell you can call me uncouth, call me in a (pinch head eye?)\n\nYou can call me miss or mister, just don't call me a quitter\n\nI've got nothing to prove, doll or dude, I'm just me\n\n\n\nWhat does it matter if you're a girl or a guy, what good's a label do?\n\nDon't let them tell you that it's do or die, i say buck up, they're the fuck up\n\nDon't let them put the blame on you, oooooh\n\n\n\nWe're both the beauty and the beast, We're the genie and the lamp\n\nWe're the tramp and we're the lady, though I'm mainly just the tramp\n\nLow and up the binary (?)\n\n\n\nI'm a stiletto on a size 12 shoe, enjoy the show and stick around or screw\n\nYeah, there's nothing they can do, darling it's true, cause I'm just me"
