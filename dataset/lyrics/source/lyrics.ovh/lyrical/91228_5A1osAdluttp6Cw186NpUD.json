  "lyrics": "With this body, he is God and I am nothing\r\nHe has come for the blood of my only son\r\nI can sense his heart beat slowly fade\r\nThe sound of my voice is his way to me\r\nI buried my tongue with my families bones\n\n\n\nAs they lay me down to sleep\n\nI pray to the Lord to put me six feet deep\n\nPut me six feet deep!\n\n\n\nFather forgive me for I have sinned\n\nI know that we will all meet our fate\n\nEven the beast of the underworld\n\nBurns eternally within his own flame\n\nSave my son, feel my embrace\n\nSleep my son\n\nFeel my embrace\n\nPlease donâ€™t forget my love\n\nAs the bullet goes through his brain\n\nI wake up to live it again and again\n\n\n\nAs they hang me down to sleep\n\nI pray to the Lord to put me six feet deep\n\nPut me six feet deep!\n\nPray to the Lord to put me six feet deep!"
