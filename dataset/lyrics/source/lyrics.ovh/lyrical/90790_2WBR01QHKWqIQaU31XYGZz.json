  "lyrics": "She prob'ly works in a restaurant\r\nThat's what her momma did\r\nBut I don't know if she ever really\r\nCould put up with it\r\nOr maybe she sings in a nightclub\r\n'Cause sometimes she used to sing\n\nBut I don't know if it ever\n\nAmounted to anything\n\n\n\nBut listen honey\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWherever you are tonight\n\nI wish you the best of everything, in the world\n\nAnd I hope you found\n\nWhatever you were looking for\n\n\n\nYeah and it's over before you know it\n\nIt all goes by so fast\n\nYeah, the bad nights last forever\n\nAnd the good nights don't ever seem to last\n\nAnd man, we never had the real thing\n\nBut sometimes we used to kiss\n\nBack when we didn't understand\n\nWhat we were caught up in\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\n\n\n(Chorus)"
