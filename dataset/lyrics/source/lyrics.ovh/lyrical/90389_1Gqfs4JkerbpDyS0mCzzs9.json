  "lyrics": "Honey I thought you should know that I'm in a hurry\r\nI've got to move up north, but it's just temporary\r\nI really tried not to lie, but this burdens getting heavy\r\nNo, you can't come with me this time, you got your own destiny, yeah\r\nWhen I look at you I see your beauty\n\nNow my baby boy, he's gonna lose me\n\n\n\nBut heaven's not too far away, I know someday you'll visit\n\nAnd I didn't think I'd go this way, can I please have one more minute\n\n\n\nNo honey I don't want to go, please know that I have to\n\nLook how the cancer has grown, I think it's time I go home\n\nYes, I can still hear your voice, sounds just like it did\n\nAnd I can still feel your hand, when it touches my skin\n\n\n\nBut heaven's not too far away, I know someday you'll visit\n\nAnd I didn't think I'd go this way, can I please have one more minute\n\nI gave you life now you gotta watch it leave my eyes\n\nBut heaven's not too far away, I know someday you'll visit\n\n\n\nAs death rattles my cage, I can hear their voices fading\n\nEach breath getting harder, I can hear the tears coming from my daughter\n\nAnd to her older brother, he's thinking back when he was younger\n\nWhen he had a healthy mother, who asked him to take care of his little brother\n\nAnd he's not really sure about life, or that how could any of this be right\n\nBut I know my babies they will be fine, cause they can talk to me anytime\n\n\n\nCause, heaven's not too far away, I know someday you'll visit\n\nI didn't think I'd go this way, can I please have one more minute\n\nI gave you life now you gotta watch it leave my eyes\n\nBut heaven's not too far away, I know someday you'll visit\n\n\n\nHoney, I thought you should know, that I'm in a hurry\n\nI've got a move up north, but it's just temporary"
