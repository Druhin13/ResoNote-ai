  "lyrics": "Watch the news\r\nAnd read the stories\r\nIt's a nightmare\r\nAnd run for cover\r\nSearch for glory\r\nIs it really anywhere\n\n\n\nDarkness in the air\n\nThe light is the extinguisher\n\nAnd with a solid fight\n\nMaybe we'll figure out\n\nJust who we were\n\n\n\nAre we lost?\n\nAre we lost?\n\nAt what cost?\n\nAre we lost?\n\n\n\nNo matter what we face\n\nOur hope, it will defend us\n\nDon't ever think that we\n\nCan't find another treasure in the dust\n\n\n\nAnd even when we have\n\nNothing left to turn to\n\nWith stronger faith\n\nWe'll see the answer\n\nAnd the lie becomes the truth\n\n\n\nAre we lost?\n\nAre we lost?\n\nAt what cost?\n\nAre we lost?\n\n\n\nAre we lost?\n\n\n\nLost\n\nAre we lost?\n\nAt what cost?\n\nAre we lost?\n\n\n\nYou tell me are we lost?\n\nYou tell me are we lost?\n\nYou tell me are we lost?\n\nPlease tell me are we lost?\n\nPlease tell me are we lost oh oh"
