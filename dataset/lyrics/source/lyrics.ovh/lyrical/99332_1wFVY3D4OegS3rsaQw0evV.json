  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Here par Years & Years\r\nYou take a week, all the time that you need\nShattering glass and a lover or three\nOh, baby, you're so independent\nYou're on the drug of a Gemini cusp\nTurn it up louder, spit on that cut\nOh, I won't keep you out of trouble\nTake it from me (I do the best that I can)\nTake it from me (love like it always goes bad)\nTake it from me (take back the life that you gave to me)\n\nI'm not here\nOh, I'm not here\nI'm not here\nOh, I'm not here"
