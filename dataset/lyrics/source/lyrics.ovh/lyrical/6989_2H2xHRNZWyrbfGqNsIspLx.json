  "lyrics": "Good morning Weathercock: \nHow did you fare last night? \nDid the cold wind bite you, \ndid you face up to the fright \nWhen the leaves spin from October \nand whip around your tail? \n\nDid you shake from the blast, \n\ndid you shiver through the gale? \n\nGive us direction; the best of goodwill, \n\nPut us in touch with fair winds. \n\nSing to us softly, hum evening's song. \n\nTell us what the blacksmith has done for you. \n\n\n\nDo you simply reflect changes \n\nin the patterns of the sky, \n\nOr is it true to say the weather heeds \n\nthe twinkle in your eye? \n\nDo you fight the rush of winter; \n\ndo you hold snowflakes at bay? \n\nDo you lift the dawn sun from the fields \n\nand help him on his way? \n\n\n\nGood morning Weathercock: make this day bright. \n\nPut us in touch with your fair winds. \n\nSing to us softly, hum evening's song. \n\nPoint the way to better days we can share with you."
