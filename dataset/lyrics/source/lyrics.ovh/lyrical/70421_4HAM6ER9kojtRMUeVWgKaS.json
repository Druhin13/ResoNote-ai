  "title": "Learnin The Blues",
  "lyrics": "The tables are empty, the dance floor's deserted.\rYou play the same love song - it's the 10th time you've heard it.\rThat's the beginning, just one of the clues.\rYou've had your first lesson in learnin' the blues.\rThe cigarettes you light, one after another,\rWon't help you forget her, and the way that you love her.\rYou're only burnin' a torch you can't lose.\rBut you're on the right track for learnin' the blues.\rWhen you're at home alone,\rThe blues will taunt you constantly.\rWhen you're out in a crowd,\rThe blues will haunt your memory.\rThe nights when you don't sleep, the whole night you're crying.\rBut you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying.\rYou'll walk that floor and wear out your shoes.\rWhen you feel your heart break, you're learnin' the blues.\rWhen you're at home alone,\rThe blues will taunt you constantly.\rWhen you're out in a crowd,\rThose blues will haunt your memory.\rThe nights when you don't sleep, that whole night you're crying.\rBut you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying.\rYou'll walk the floor, and you'll wear out your shoes.\rWhen you feel your heart break, you're learnin' those blues."
