  "lyrics": "It takes highs and lows to celebrate you\r\nIt takes all my words just to sell them the truth\r\nThey don't love me quite like they used to\r\nThey don't love me quite like they did\r\nPay the girl tell her give me a hairdo\n\nPaint my lips in shimmering French Blue\n\nThey always tell you don't read the reviews\n\nSo I am blind but the pictures of you\n\n\n\nWhen I went play\n\nSnow covered happy Maine\n\nHow could I touch something so white?\n\nTake from you something so bright?\n\nHow could I? How could I?\n\n\n\nEverything is fine\n\nIt's gonna take some time\n\nWhen I see of lines of trees\n\nIt feels like you're with me\n\nFeels like this song don't mean a thing\n\n\n\nIt takes highs and lows to celebrate you\n\nIt takes all my words to celebrate you\n\nIt takes all my sight, to actually see you\n\nIt takes all my love to celebrate you\n\n\n\nEverything is fine\n\nIt's gonna take some time\n\nWhen all I can do is scream\n\nIt feels like you're listening\n\n\n\nHow could I touch something so white?\n\nTake from you something so bright?\n\nHow could I touch something so white?\n\nTake from you something so bright?\n\nHow could I?\n\n\n\nEverything is fine\n\nIt's gonna take some time\n\nWhen I see of lines of trees\n\nIt feels like you're with me\n\nFeels like this song don't mean a thing"
