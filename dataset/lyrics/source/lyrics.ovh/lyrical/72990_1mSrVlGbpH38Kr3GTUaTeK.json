  "lyrics": "All along it was a fever\r\nA cold with high-headed believers\r\nI threw my hands in the air I said show me something\r\nHe said, if you dare come a little closer\r\nRound and around and around and around we go\n\nOhhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know\n\n\n\nNot really sure how to feel about it\n\nSomething in the way you move\n\nMakes me feel like I can't live without you\n\nIt takes me all the way\n\nI want you to stay\n\n\n\nIt's not much of a life you're living\n\nIt's not just something you take, it's given\n\nRound and around and around and around we go\n\nOhhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know\n\n\n\nNot really sure how to feel about it\n\nSomething in the way you move\n\nMakes me feel like I can't live without you\n\nIt takes me all the way\n\nI want you to stay\n\n\n\nOhhh the reason I hold on\n\nOhhh cause I need this hole gone\n\nWell, funny you're the broken one, but I'm the only one who needed saving\n\nCause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving\n\n\n\nNot really sure how to feel about it\n\nSomething in the way you move\n\nMakes me feel like I can't live without you\n\nIt takes me all the way\n\nI want you to stay, stay\n\nI want you to stay, oh"
