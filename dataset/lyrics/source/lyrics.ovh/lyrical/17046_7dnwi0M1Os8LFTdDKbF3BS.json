  "lyrics": "Toll no bell for me, Father\r\nBut let this cup of suffering pass from me\r\nSend me no shepherd to heal my world\r\nBut the Angel - the dream foretold\r\nPrayed more than thrice for You to see\r\nThe wolf of loneliness in me\n\n...not my own will but Yours be done...\n\n\n\nYou wake up, where's the tomb?\n\nWill Easter come, enter my room?\n\nThe lord weeps with me\n\nBut my tears fall for you\n\n\n\nAnother beauty\n\nLoved by a Beast\n\nAnother tale of infinitely dreams\n\nYour eyes they were my paradise\n\nYour smile made my sun rise\n\n\n\nForgive me, for I don't know what I gain\n\nAlone in this garden of pain\n\nEnchantment has but one truth:\n\nI weep to have what I fear to lose\n\n\n\n[Repeat chorus]\n\n\n\n\"I knew you never before\n\nI see you never more\n\nBut the love, the pain, the hope, O beautifull one\n\nHave made you mine, 'till all my years are done\"\n\n\n\nWithout you\n\nThe poetry within me is dead"
