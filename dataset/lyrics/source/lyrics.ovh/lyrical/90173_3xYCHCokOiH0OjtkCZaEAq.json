  "lyrics": "Shadows hang behind us both\r\nSpecially when I lie this low\r\nYou say you want to trust me more\r\nBut you lie all you want\r\nWhat is it that you don't understand\n\nI'll be gone into my mind\n\nSo you remember this\n\nI'll always be loyal babe\n\n\n\nCome to see where you work\n\nAnd everytime now, I'll be your girl\n\nHanging on you everywhere\n\nYou'll play along to make me hope\n\n\n\nWhat is it that you don't understand\n\nI'll be gone into my mind\n\nSo you remember this\n\nI, I'll always be loyal babe\n\n\n\nFire has died\n\nI'm still loyal to you\n\nFire has died\n\nBut I'm loyal to you always\n\nNow come and take me and lie in bed\n\nAnd we both acknowledge this is dead\n\n\n\nI wanted to prove you wrong\n\nI'm still faithful to the white lies\n\nSo you remember this\n\nI'll always be loyal babe\n\n\n\n(Fire has died)\n\nI'll always be loyal babe (I'm still loyal to you)\n\n(Fire has died but)\n\n(But I'm loyal to you always)\n\n(I'm still loyal to you)\n\n(Fire has died)\n\n(but I'm loyal to you always)\n\n(Fire has died)\n\n(I'm still loyal to you)\n\n(Fire has died)\n\n(but I'm loyal to you always)\n\nFire has died\n\nI'm still loyal to you\n\nFire has died\n\nBut I'm loyal to you always"
