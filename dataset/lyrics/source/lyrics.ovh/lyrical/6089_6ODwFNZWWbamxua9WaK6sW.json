  "lyrics": "There was a time when I brought light to your eyes\r\nEven the worst of days could not keep us apart\r\nAnd you weren't afraid to spill those evil thoughts\r\nEven the ones that made you question who you are\r\nYou feel it, eyes racing, my feet were buried in the ground\n\nMy chains break and I can't take the sounds\n\nI don't feel like I still have anything to hold me here\n\nMy steps fade and she can't take the sound\n\n\n\nThe good days fade, the bad ones take\n\nAnd break the spirits we once shared\n\nEvery touch feels empty now\n\nYou took my words and they cut deep\n\nAnd keep replaying in your head\n\nI'm moving mountains as you drown\n\n\n\nYou feel it, eyes racing, my feet were buried in the ground\n\nMy chains break and I can't take the sounds\n\nI don't feel like I still have anything to hold me here\n\nMy steps fade and she can't take the sound\n\n\n\nYou feel it, eyes racing, my feet were buried in the ground\n\nMy chains break and I can't take the sound (the sound, the sound)\n\nI don't feel like I still have anything to hold me here\n\nMy steps fade and she can't take the sound"
