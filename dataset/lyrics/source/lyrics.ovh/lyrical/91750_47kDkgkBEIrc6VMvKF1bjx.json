  "lyrics": "I bet she's got them windows rolled down\r\nTom Petty's on, she's singin' along\r\nBet she's all tanned up from that summer sun\r\nAnd she might be dancin' to long haired cover band on the coast\r\nBut if I know her she ain't dancin' alone\n\nShe's probably in love by now, a girl like that don't stay lonely long\n\nAnd I bet she's already found somebody else and he ain't doin' her wrong\n\nWouldn't do no good even if I could somehow track her down\n\nShe's probably in love by now\n\n\n\nBet she's prettyin' up some old boy's shotgun seat, toe nails painted pink\n\nBet those Ray-Bans are holdin' that blonde hair back\n\nI bet he's holdin' her close at night and she ain't losin' any sleep\n\nIf I know her she sure ain't thinkin' 'bout me\n\n\n\nShe's probably in love by now, a girl like that don't stay lonely long\n\nAnd I bet she's already found somebody else and he ain't doin' her wrong\n\nWouldn't do no good even if I could somehow track her down\n\nShe's probably in love by now\n\nYeah she's probably in love\n\n\n\nWherever she is out there tonight I bet her heart ain't hurting like mine\n\nShe's probably in love by now\n\nYeah She's probably in love by now\n\n\n\nShe's probably in love by now, a girl like that don't stay lonely long\n\nAnd I bet she's already found somebody else and he ain't doin' her wrong\n\nWouldn't do no good even if I could somehow track her down\n\nShe's probably in love by now\n\n\n\nYeah she's probably in love\n\nShe's probably in love by now"
