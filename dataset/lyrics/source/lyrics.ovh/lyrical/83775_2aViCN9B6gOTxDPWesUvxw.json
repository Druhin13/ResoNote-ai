  "lyrics": "Dear child of mine, pain turns to destiny...\r\nDown from the mountains, in the form of a rose\r\nThe thunder of oceans shall bring forth the ghost\r\nOf an infinite star that will rest in my tree\r\nLike the full moon of night\r\nDescending like me\n\n\n\nSuch is my journey\n\nNo matter where my spirit shall travel\n\nYou will be there...\n\n\n\nWinter sheds its grief in snow\n\nSummer weeps\n\nIt must be so\n\nThus let thee live\n\nUnseen, unknown\n\n\n\nLight is the body and no more than a shell\n\nReleasing our spirits to heaven or hell\n\nWhile embracing my love to let go of your hand\n\nAnd to reach for a kingdom forgotten by man\n\n\n\nForgive me my sister, she would not come\n\nThis travel, she said, you must do alone...\n\n\n\nBring to heart Johanna's name\n\nThrough my blood you share the same\n\nTo hold, to keep through dust, through rain\n\n\n\nSay you knew\n\nYes only you could grow the seeds of time\n\nRun and flow through silver snow\n\nOf mountains spring must climb\n\nFrom this hill, to waters still\n\nMy heart will guide your way\n\nLove and wrath, my epitaph before your name I lay"
