  "lyrics": "Legs are tied, these hands are broken\r\nAlone I try with words unspoken\r\nSilent cry, my breath is frozen\r\nWith blinded eyes, I fear myself!\r\nIt's burning down, it's burning high\n\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\n\nWe burned it out oh my oh why\n\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\n\n\n\nMy throat is dry, my vision's fading\n\nI'm paralyzed and left here waiting\n\nTaking time just one step forward\n\nWon't lose my mind, I'm here to stay\n\n\n\nIt's burning down, it's burning high\n\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\n\nWe burned it out oh my oh why\n\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\n\n\n\nWhoa (Legends rise)\n\nWhoa (Legends rise)\n\n(Legends rise)\n\n\n\n(Legends rise)\n\n\n\nIt's burning down, it's burning high\n\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\n\nWe burned it out oh my oh why\n\nWhen ashes fall the legends rise\n\n\n\nWhoa (Legends rise)\n\nWhoa (Legends rise)"
