  "lyrics": "Up on Scorpion Hill watching life\r\nPassing me by in the pale moonlight\r\nAnd I sat there forever, three sheets to the wind\r\nIt’s not helping my case, the state that I’m in\r\nBut it’s not how they told you\r\nMy intentions were good\n\nI was just bursting apart like the end of the ark\n\nHolding on to whatever I could\n\n\n\nA square of light moves its way through the empty room\n\nAcross the stained yellow carpet\n\nLike a ghost of myself in the afternoon\n\nHaunting my basement apartment\n\nI looked in to the mirror\n\nHanging behind my door\n\nThe glass was cracked and the man staring back\n\nHe don’t look like me anymore\n\nAnd if the world is gonna burn\n\nEveryone should get a turn to light it up\n\n\n\nDown and out, I’ve been on the rocks\n\nI’ve been having some pretty dark thoughts\n\nYeah, I like them a lot\n\n\n\nTime and time again, well I’ve tried and failed\n\nTo get my act together\n\nAnd I’ll admit lately things really went off the rails\n\nI know that you deserve better\n\nBut in the morning, as I was boarding\n\nThe commuter train to work\n\nThe boss was calling, he said: “There’s been cutbacks and\n\nI’m sorry you’re the first”\n\nAnd If I can’t support the two of us\n\nHow can I support a third?\n\n\n\nDown and out, I’ve been on the rocks\n\nI’ve been having some pretty dark thoughts\n\n\n\nAnd I’m on the brink\n\nFallin’ deep into debt\n\nFallin’ deep into drink\n\nI can drown those regrets\n\nI don’t have to think\n\n\n\nNow I’m working the night shift\n\nAsleep at the wheel\n\nI was bursting apart like a flame from a spark\n\nThinkin' \"Jesus, this can’t be for real\"\n\n\n\nMy sweat soaked mattress\n\nCorner of the room\n\nCigarettes and matches\n\nIn the fading afternoon\n\nAnd a picture of my kid, yeah he’s smiling\n\nIt’s the first day of school\n\n\n\nShe said: I found the gun, it was buried beneath\n\nPiles of clothes in the room where your son sleeps\n\nAnd I can’t pretend, to know how this will end"
