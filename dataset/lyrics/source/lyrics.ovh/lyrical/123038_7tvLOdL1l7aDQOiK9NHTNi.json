  "lyrics": "I'm going back inside that church again\r\nTo marry her and now let go of him\r\nI still remember where he lay\r\nShe's gonna pass that very spot today\r\nShe's so beautiful wearing her dress\r\nI watch her father take her hand in his\n\nAnd they walk by that very spot\n\nReminding me of everything I've got\n\n\n\nI know I won't find love like you\n\n\n\nAnd I know you know I'm not perfect\n\nI hope you find that I'm worth it\n\nI'm gonna show, you won't be alone\n\nAnd we could grow old, baby, we could grow old\n\nSay yes and you won't regret it\n\nYour heart won't break, I won't let it\n\nI'll make you see, it's not make-believe\n\nAnd we could grow old, baby, we could grow old\n\n\n\nI'm at the altar on the brink of tears\n\nWe miss a few, but all the rest are here\n\nAnd as I hear the organ play\n\nI swear to God that it was worth the wait\n\n\n\nI know I won't find love like you\n\n\n\nAnd I know you know I'm not perfect\n\nI hope you find that I'm worth it\n\nI'm gonna show, you won't be alone\n\nAnd we could grow old, baby, we could grow old\n\nSay yes and you won't regret it\n\nYour heart won't break, I won't let it\n\nI'll make you see, it's not make-believe\n\nAnd we could grow old, baby, we could grow old\n\n\n\nI don't know where I'd be\n\nWhere I'd be without her\n\nShe gave me love and life when feeling I was nothing worth\n\nYeah, nothing worth\n\nHaven't you noticed?\n\nHaven't you noticed?\n\n\n\nI know I won't find love like you\n\n\n\nAnd I know you know I'm not perfect\n\nI hope you find that I'm worth it\n\nI'm gonna show, you won't be alone\n\nAnd we could grow old, baby, we could grow old\n\nSay yes and you won't regret it\n\nYour heart won't break, I won't let it\n\nI'll make you see, it's not make-believe\n\nAnd we could grow old, baby, we could grow old"
