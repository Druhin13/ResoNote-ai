  "lyrics": "Haven't seen you 'round\r\nGot me in a craze\r\nAnd going through an awkward faze\r\nI hate the taste it leaves us\r\nI know your light's gone out\r\nBut are you still awake?\n\nStuck inside a downhill haze\n\nYou seem so out of reach now\n\n\n\nYou're one step in and out again\n\nIt's useless\n\nIt was everything and the colours spin\n\nWe lose it\n\nThought you'd be my alibi\n\n\n\nAlibi\n\nAlibi\n\nAlibi\n\n\n\nSo you're lying on my couch\n\nBut you want to give it space\n\nI'm slipping into your disdain\n\nDon't be so cold and reckless\n\nWell, maybe you're too proud\n\nI can see it in your face\n\nOh, the silence could have cut the air\n\n\n\nYou're one step in and out again\n\nIt's useless\n\nIt was everything and the colours spin\n\nWe lose it\n\nThought you'd be my alibi\n\n\n\nAlibi\n\nAlibi\n\nAlibi\n\n\n\nYou're one step in and out again\n\nAlibi\n\nYou're one step in and out again\n\nAlibi\n\nIt's useless\n\nIt's useless"
