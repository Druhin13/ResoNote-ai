  "lyrics": "Just look at us\r\nYou’d never bet against our love\r\nGot that kind of thing that lasts\r\nTable for two\r\nShe said \"for life\" so I’m confused\r\nHow’d she turn it off so fast\n\n\n\nDon’t know what she left me for\n\nShe won’t talk to me anymore\n\n\n\nSo if you see her\n\nTell her I’d do anything, I need her\n\nI know I’m not perfect but we were\n\nShe says she doesn’t love me, don’t believe her\n\nIf you see her\n\n\n\nMaybe today\n\nMy phone will ring, I’ll see her name\n\nTrying not to hold my breath\n\nIt’s all a blur\n\nBut I remember holding her last\n\nTime that I was in her bed\n\n\n\nWoke up with her head on my chest\n\nThis doesn’t make any sense\n\n\n\nSo if you see her\n\nTell her I’d do anything, I need her\n\nI know I’m not perfect but we were\n\nShe says she doesn’t love me, don’t believe her\n\nIf you see her\n\n\n\nDoes she remember\n\nThe night before goodbye she said forever\n\nAnd made me swear I’d never leave her\n\nShe says she doesn’t love me, don’t believe her\n\nIf you see her\n\n\n\nSo if you see her\n\nTell her I’d do anything, I need her\n\nI know I’m not perfect but we were\n\nShe says she doesn’t love me, don’t believe her\n\nIf you see her\n\n\n\nDoes she remember\n\nThe night before goodbye she said forever\n\nAnd made me swear I’d never leave her\n\nShe says she doesn’t love me, don’t believe her\n\nIf you see her\n\n\n\nIf you see her\n\nTell her that she’s fucked it, I can’t read her\n\nWe both know she’s not perfect either\n\nBut if she says she loves me, let me see her\n\nLet me see her"
