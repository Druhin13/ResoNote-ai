  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Acres Wild par Jethro Tull\r\nI'll make love to you \nin all good places \nunder black mountains \nin open spaces. \nBy deep brown rivers \nthat slither darkly \nthrough far marches \nwhere the blue hare races. \n\nCome with me to the Winged Isle --- \nnorthern father's western child. \nWhere the dance of ages is playing still \nthrough far marches of acres wild. \n\nI'll make love to you \nin narrow side streets \n\nwith shuttered windows, \ncrumbling chimneys. \n\nCome with me to the weary town --- \ndiscos silent under tiles \nthat slide from roof-tops, scatter softly \non concrete marches of acres wild. \n\nBy red bricks pointed \nwith cement fingers \nFlaking damply from sagging shoulders. \n\nCome with me to the Winged Isle --- \nnorthern father's western child. \nWhere the dance of ages is playing still \nthrough far marches of acres wild."
