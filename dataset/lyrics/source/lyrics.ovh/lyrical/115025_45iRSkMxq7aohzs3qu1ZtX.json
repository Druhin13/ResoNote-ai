  "lyrics": "Riding round with the top off\r\nBaby, we've been driving round for some time\r\nI think we should slow it, slow it, down, down, baby\r\n'Cause you might've missed the signs\r\nYou say it's Bonnie & Clyde but I feel like Bobby and Whitney\n\nDon't know if you're ride for me or if you riding against me\n\nAre you afraid of something? Baby, let me know\n\n'Cause I don't need love from no one if I can't have it all\n\n\n\nWould you die for me? I would die for you\n\nWould you shoot for me? I would kill for you\n\nWould you run off the bag if I needed you to?\n\nGirl, all the things that I'd do for you\n\nWould you do for me too?\n\n\n\nDark nights, we had some dark nights\n\nBaby, now I, I can't see the lines\n\nGoing a hunned and five miles in a twenty mile lane\n\nGirl, I think I messed up this time\n\n\n\nYou say it's Jay and Beyonce but I feel like Lucy and Ricky\n\nI wanna know when it pops off that you gon' be right next to me\n\nAre you afraid of something? Baby, let me know\n\n'Cause I don't need love from no one if I can't have it all\n\n\n\nWould you die for me? I would die for you\n\nWould you ride for me like I'd ride for you?\n\nWould you shoot for me? I would kill for you\n\nGirl, all the things that I'd do for you\n\nWould you do for me too?"
