  "lyrics": "We were running onto something\r\nAnd we didn’t say \"forever,\" but it's all we wanted\r\nYou were so in love with simple things\r\nAnd now we’re searching for the fire dripped in kerosene\r\nI’ve been loving more, living less\r\nOff of highs and lows, so obsessed\n\nCouldn’t get nothin, but we're never running out\n\n\n\nWe'll be free spirits, free spirits\n\nCan you hear me calling?\n\nOh, it's all or nothing\n\nWhen you're free spirits, free spirits\n\nCan you hear it calling?\n\n'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don’t let me go\n\n\n\nIs this Heaven or Armageddon?\n\nI'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'\n\nWe were drownin' down our memories\n\nA cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed\n\nWhen you’re loving more, caring less\n\nIt’s the highs and lows with no regrets, oh\n\nAnd we wanted it all then, but we’re never running out\n\n\n\nWe'll be free spirits, free spirits\n\nCan you hear me calling?\n\nOh, it's all or nothing\n\nWhen you're free spirits, free spirits\n\nCan you hear it calling?\n\n'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don’t let me go\n\n\n\nSo tell me when you're falling\n\nNo, I can never doubt your love\n\nCan you hear me calling?\n\nIs it everything you're dreaming of?\n\nLeave it all on the night\n\nAs long as you're not leaving me behind\n\nOn your heart, your heart, ah\n\n\n\nFree spirits, free spirit\n\nFree spirits, free spirit"
