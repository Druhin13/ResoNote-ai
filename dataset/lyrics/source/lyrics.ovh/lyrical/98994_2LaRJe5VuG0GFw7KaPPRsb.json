  "lyrics": "Fancy meeting you here! Looks like you listened all the way to the end of the album. Kudos! We hope you enjoyed yourself and that it was a musical adventure that touched your heart, your mind, your butt, your soul, your butt again and of course, your schpoodle. A lot of bands don't get the chance to make six albums, so we just wanted to thank you, the fans, from the bottom of our schpoodles for supporting us. We love you so much and we promise to have six with and/or kill as many of you as possible. Sorry, Brian and I have competing agendas. Until next time, as they say in Italy, au revoir. That means good morning"
