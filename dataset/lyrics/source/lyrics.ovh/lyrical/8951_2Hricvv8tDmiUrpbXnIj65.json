  "lyrics": "I know this me and you thing\r\nIs a new thing\r\nAnd I'd be lying if I said this is what I was looking for\r\nI kinda can't stop thinking\r\nThat leaving is the last thing I wanna be doing right now for sure\n\nMaybe I'll oversleep\n\nAnd miss my flight\n\nMy alarm went off at 6:05\n\nBut I never heard it\n\nAccidentally on purpose\n\nMaybe I'd lay you with just like this\n\nAnd give you one more goodbye kiss\n\nAnd slip those three little words in\n\nAccidentally on purpose\n\n\n\nI never thought you'd call\n\nSo, I guess it's your fault\n\nI wasn't trying to fall\n\nBut you and my heart were making other plans\n\nBut here I am crazy about you\n\nNot ready for a day without you\n\nHere I am saying 'what the hell?'\n\nWide awake telling myself\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll oversleep\n\nAnd miss my flight\n\nMy alarm went off at 6:05\n\nBut I never heard it\n\nAccidentally on purpose\n\nMaybe I'd lay you with just like this\n\nAnd give you one more goodbye kiss\n\nAnd slip those three little words in\n\nAccidentally on purpose\n\n\n\nWhat if I stay?\n\nWhat would you say?\n\n\n\nI know this me and you thing\n\nIs a new thing\n\nBut leaving is the last thing I wanna be doing right now\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll oversleep\n\nAnd miss my flight\n\nMy alarm went off at 6:05\n\nBut I never heard it\n\nAccidentally on purpose\n\nMaybe I'll lay you with just like this\n\nAnd give you one more goodbye kiss\n\nAnd slip those three little words in\n\nAccidentally on purpose\n\n\n\nWhat if I stay?\n\nAccidentally on purpose"
