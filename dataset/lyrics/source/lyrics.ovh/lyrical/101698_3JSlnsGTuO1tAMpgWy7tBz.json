  "lyrics": "Same old shoes on the same old feet\r\nSame colored tie every day of the week\r\nShampoo, conditioner, instant repeat\r\nDrip dry, do it again\r\nI tell my woes to the knife and the spoon\r\nDining alone at a table for two\n\nOne glass of wine is plenty of time\n\nTo dream about all of the things that I'll never do\n\n\n\nI wonder what it's like to fly a plane\n\nTo meet a girl on Friday night\n\nAnd wake up next to her on Saturday\n\nTo swim across the ocean blue\n\nTo walk a mile upon the moon\n\nTo wear the crown and sit upon the throne\n\nBut it's getting late, this restaurant is closing\n\nI guess I'd better go\n\n\n\nI wander through the city, whistle a tune\n\nWalk into a bar and ruin the mood\n\nA dirty martini with an olive or two\n\nShake, pour, do it again\n\nA couple more drinks, now they're kicking me out\n\nI always get in trouble when I open my mouth\n\nStumble on home, fall into bed\n\nAnd drift off into my head\n\n\n\nI wonder what it's like to fly a plane\n\nTo meet a girl on Friday night\n\nAnd wake up next to her on Saturday\n\nTo swim across the ocean blue\n\nTo walk a mile upon the moon\n\nTo wear the crown and sit upon the throne\n\nBut it's getting late, the sun is coming up\n\nOff to work I go\n\n\n\nSame old shoes on the same old feet\n\nOne-track mind, one-way street\n\nNothing's gonna change for the same old me\n\nEat, sleep, do it again\n\nEat, sleep, do it again"
