  "lyrics": "Round and round we go still searching for a better way\r\nTime and place are all but lost forgotten on the way\r\nRunning running running down trying to escape the maze\r\nLife is simplified when you're just a castaway\r\nTake me to the water and let me find the light\n\nGive me what I need to make all the wrongs right\n\nFloating floating floating up til I'm out of sight\n\nLife is just a breeze and I, I am just a kite\n\n\n\nKeep searching until you find it\n\nEven if it takes all night\n\nCan't stop it and rewind it\n\nYou feel it and you know\n\n\n\nAnd then you press play\n\nThis meditation is the best way\n\nJust let the rhythm take your stress away\n\nWe keep it going to the next day\n\nJust press play"
