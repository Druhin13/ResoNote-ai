  "lyrics": "I pledge allegiance to myself\r\nFood, shelter, and health\r\nLet me find a beach full of seashells to sell\r\nPut your oxygen mask on first before you offer me help\r\nI've got receipts made of scar tissue\r\nGot the vision of somebody going fishing in the dark\n\nWhen I start up the motor, it still turns over\n\nBut nowadays, a little bit slower\n\nNever been afraid of getting older\n\nI'm much more nervous about these public servants\n\nKill the lights and shut the curtains\n\nYou ain't a real lion if you love the circus\n\nLooking at myself like \"What's the purpose?\"\n\nThat's when I started to hallucinate\n\nTrying to touch the surface and recuperate\n\nYou should've seen the look on my face when I was losing my faith\n\nY'all got me feeling hesitation, embarrassment\n\nI might be the last generation of grandparents\n\nI know that I've been fortunate for all the opportunities\n\nDisproportionately disappointed in the human beings\n\nI get it, we're specks of dust, at the bus stop busking for extra crust\n\nLike fuck it, you can sacrifice me to the weather\n\nIf you promise that you'll let my songs live forever\n\n\n\nYou're looking for a bag of tricks\n\nBut my love is like a stack of bricks\n\nCobblestones and untreated lumber\n\nI'm a father of fists, strength, and numbers\n\nAnd when they come for my box of dreams\n\nI'm a finally depart from this toxic scene\n\nNo posturing, just lots of self esteem\n\nGot you feeling like the popular queen\n\nThis ain't magic, this is fabric\n\nAnd it's the type that never requires patches\n\nAnd it's the fire that illustrates with ashes\n\nIt's our life, it's nothing we can't manage\n\nLower the arrow and take a breath\n\nI won't waste ammo aiming at the angel of death\n\nI might have already left, but they hear me still\n\nWith my pale knuckle grip on this steering wheel"
