  "lyrics": "Get out of your own way, hey, hey\r\nGet out of your own way, hey, hey\r\nLove hurts\r\nNow you're the girl who's left with no words\r\nYour heart's a balloon, but then it bursts\n\nIt doesn't take a cannon, just a pin\n\nYour skin's not covering\n\nAnd resistance\n\nLove has got to fight for its existence\n\nThe enemy has armies for assistance\n\nThe amorist, the glamorous, the kiss\n\nA fist, listen to this, oh\n\n\n\nGet out of your own way, oh, I\n\nGet out of your own way, oh, I\n\n\n\nI could sing it to you all night, all night\n\nIf I could, I'd make it alright, alright\n\nNothing's stopping you except what's inside\n\nI can help you, but it's your fight, your fight\n\n\n\nFight back\n\nDon't take it lyin' down, you got to bite back\n\nThe face of liberty's starting to crack\n\nShe had a plan up until she got smacked in the mouth\n\nAnd it all went south\n\nLike freedom\n\nThe slaves are lookin' for someone to lead them\n\nThe master's lookin' for someone to need him\n\nThe promised land is there for those who need it most\n\nAnd Lincoln's ghost said...\n\n\n\nGet out of your own way, oh, I\n\nGet out of your own way, oh, I\n\n\n\nI could sing it to you all night, all night\n\nIf I could, I'd make it alright, alright\n\nNothing's stopping you except what's inside\n\nI can help you, but it's your fight, your fight\n\n\n\nGet out of your own way\n\nGet out of your own way\n\n\n\n\n\nGet out of your own way\n\nGet out of your own way\n\nGet out of your own way\n\n\n\nBlessed are the arrogant\n\nFor there is the kingdom of their own company\n\nBlessed are the superstars\n\nFor the magnificence in their light\n\nWe understand better our own insignificance\n\nBlessed are the filthy rich\n\nFor you can only truly own what you give away\n\nLike your pain"
