  "lyrics": "I love the songs I hated when I was young\r\nBecause they take me back where I come from\r\nWhen every broken heart seemed like the end\r\nWhen everyone was someone different then\r\nBut I can't be alone in a crowded room\n\nWhere my thoughts, they run like water down a flume\n\nThere are days when I will let the darkness rise\n\nI don't always choose to stay on the sunny side\n\n\n\nSometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)\n\nBecause it's harder to forgive than to forget\n\nSometimes it's harder to forgive\n\n\n\nYes, my life has seen some wasted time\n\nI have suffered for the peace inside my mind\n\nAnd some things are better left unsaid\n\nWhile some things work out different when they're in your head\n\n\n\nBut I'm not sorry for the things I say\n\nSometimes I let my mouth just run away\n\nAnd I believe that all souls are born kind\n\nAnd that all love lost comes back in time\n\n\n\nSometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)\n\nBecause it's harder to forgive than to forget\n\nSometimes it's harder to forgive\n\n\n\nAnd even if the world is really round\n\nAnd all the maps are painted upside down\n\nSo if you stand in one place for too long\n\nEverything around you will be gone\n\nWell, I'm not gonna miss you when I'm gone\n\nNow the part of me that's left wants you to know\n\nThat I'm not gonna jump towards the light\n\nThe ones who believe choose life\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nAh, ooh\n\nAh"
