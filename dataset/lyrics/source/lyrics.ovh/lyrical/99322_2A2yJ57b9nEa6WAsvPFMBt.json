  "lyrics": "Treading waters poisoned by timeless intoxicants, always knowing that a darkness will find us\r\nScaling walls of imagined boundaries, we are the reapers of shame, the successors of pain\r\nI could follow you down to the bottom of your solemn state, straining to pull you out of the trenches that your mind creates\r\nHesitation sits in hindsight of the blind man\n\nCut me open\n\n\n\nWon't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly\n\nI don't want to see you suffer forever (forever)\n\nYou are seemingly safe and sound, but you carry such a heavy weight; a spirit that slowly drowns, but the body doesn't translate\n\n\n\nBolstering the need to feel accomplished, overshadowed by\n\nDecisions of finite progress\n\nA moment to take my time to let the noise subside\n\nMaybe I can finally breathe if I take a step outside myself\n\nMaybe I can finally breathe easy\n\nCut me a box to size, yeah\n\n\n\nWon't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly\n\nI don't want to see you suffer forever, forever\n\nPlagued by thoughts of self-defeat\n\n\n\nGhost of nothing\n\nA ghost of a nothing; an anchor for all suffering\n\n\n\nWon't you follow tonight\n\nI donâ€™t want to see you suffer\n\n\n\nWon't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly\n\nI don't want to see you suffer (suffer) forever (forever)\n\nWon't you follow tonight, just breathe in slowly\n\nI don't want to see you suffer (suffer) forever (forever)\n\nI don't want to see you\n\n\n\nA ghost of a nothing; an anchor for all suffering"
