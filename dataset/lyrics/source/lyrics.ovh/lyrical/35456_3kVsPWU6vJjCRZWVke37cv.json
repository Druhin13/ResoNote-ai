  "lyrics": "Since it costs a lot to win, and even more to lose,\nYou and me bound to spend some time wond'rin' what to choose.\nGoes to show, you don't ever know,\nWatch each card you play and play it slow,\nWait until that deal come round,\nDon't you let that deal go down, no, no.\n\n\n\nI been gamblin' hereabouts for ten good solid years,\n\nIf I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears.\n\nGoes to show you don't ever know\n\nWatch each card you play and play it slow,\n\nWait until that deal come round,\n\nDon't you let that deal go down, no, no.\n\n\n\nSince you poured the wine for me and tightened up my shoes,\n\nI hate to leave you sittin' there, composin' lonesome blues.\n\nGoes to show you don't ever know\n\nWatch each card you play and play it slow,\n\nWait until that deal come round, don't you let that deal go down.\n\n\n\nWait until that deal come round, don't you let that deal go down,\n\nWait until that deal come round, don't you let that deal go down,\n\nDon't you let that deal go down, don't you let that deal go down."
