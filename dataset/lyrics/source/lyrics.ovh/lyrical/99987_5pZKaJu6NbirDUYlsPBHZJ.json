  "lyrics": "All my devotion is like sinking sand\r\nI've nothing to cling to but your sweet hand\r\nI've no clear emotions keeping me safe at night\r\nOnly your presence, like a candle light\r\nAfter everything I've had\n\nAfter everything I've lost\n\nLord, I know this much is true\n\nI'm still drawn to you\n\n\n\nI pour out my sorrows like a precious oil\n\nI kiss your feet, Lord, with a holy joy\n\nMy tears an offering of my highest praise\n\nYour eyes say 'welcome.' And I receive Your gaze\n\n\n\nAfter everything I've had\n\nAfter everything I've lost\n\nLord, I know this much is true\n\nI'm still drawn to you\n\n\n\nAfter everything's been said\n\nAfter everything love cost\n\nLord, I know this much is true\n\nI'm still drawn to you"
