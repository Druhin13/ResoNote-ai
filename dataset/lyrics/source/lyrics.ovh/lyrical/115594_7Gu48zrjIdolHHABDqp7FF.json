  "lyrics": "My skin is a story\r\nWith marks and lines, it makes me feel weary\r\nMy face is like a galaxy\r\nWith spotty freckle stars and no sense of gravity\r\nBut even with the good\r\nThe bad feels so much stronger\n\nMy inner demons, they always win\n\nAnd in my mind they saunter\n\nSo many things that I've come to hate\n\nThey line my body and caress my face\n\nI feel so frail and empty too\n\nLike a china tea cup with dried out glue\n\n\n\nI am made of porcelain\n\nI'm cracking now and then, it wears me down\n\nAnd I am made of porcelain\n\nI look okay but I am breaking down\n\nOver and over again\n\nOh, over and over again\n\n\n\nStretches and patches corrupt my flesh\n\nSlowly eating away any confidence that's left\n\nAnd I really wish I wouldn't let\n\nMy appearance dictate how much I fret\n\nBecause they say what's inside is what really matters\n\nBut I really can't seem to ignore\n\nThe parts of me that I abhor\n\nIt makes me feel like I am weak and battered\n\n\n\nI am made of porcelain\n\nCracking now and then, it wears me down\n\nAnd I am made of porcelain\n\nI look okay but I am breaking down\n\nOver and over again\n\nOh, over and over again\n\n\n\nOooooo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo\n\nOo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo\n\nOooooo, oo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo\n\nOo-oo-oo-oo-oooo-oo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo\n\nOo-oo-oooo"
