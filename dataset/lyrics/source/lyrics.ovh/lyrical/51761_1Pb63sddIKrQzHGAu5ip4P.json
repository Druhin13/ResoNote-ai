  "lyrics": "I am a poor wayfaring stranger \nWhile journeying through this world of woe; \nAnd there's no sickness, toil nor danger \nIn that bright world to which I go. \nI'm going there to see my Father,\n\nI'm going there no more to roam;\n\nI'm only go-going over Jordan, \n\nI'm only go-going over home. \n\n\n\nI know dark clouds will gather 'round me, \n\nI know my way is rough and steep; \n\nAnd beautiful fields lie just before me, \n\nWhere God's redeemed there vigils keep. \n\n\n\nI'm going there to see my Mother, \n\nI'm going there no more to roam; \n\nI'm only go-going over Jordan, \n\nI'm only go-going over home. \n\n\n\nI want to wear that crown of glory, \n\nWhen I get home to that good land; \n\nI want to shout salvation's story, \n\nIn concert with ohh the blood-washed band, \n\n\n\nI'm going there to see my Saviour, \n\nI'm going there no more to roam; \n\nI'm only go-going over Jordan, \n\nI'm only go-going over home. \n\n\n\nWell I'm only go-going over Jordan. \n\nI'm only go-going over home."
