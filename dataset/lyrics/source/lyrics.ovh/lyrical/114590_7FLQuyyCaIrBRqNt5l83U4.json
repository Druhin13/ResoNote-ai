  "lyrics": "Didn't wanna be a ghost\r\nBut you pushed me over and over\r\nNever thought I'd have a vice\r\nOther than you, over and over\r\nLeft you in the sky with the fire below\n\nThought I had it right, but I'm still\n\n\n\nLost in the light\n\nAnd I don't know what night it is\n\nYou're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess\n\nBlurry bodies, but you're on my mind\n\nWe let it go now I'm full of rum and regret\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\n\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out, go out\n\n\n\nI never thought a sunrise\n\nCould burn more than a midnight without you\n\nAlready paying for tonight\n\nHead spins like carousel, over and over\n\n\n\nLeft you in the sky with the fire below\n\nThought I had it right, but I'm still\n\n\n\nLost in the light\n\nAnd I don't know what night it is\n\nYou're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess\n\nBlurry bodies, but you're on my mind\n\nWe let it go now I'm full of rum and regret\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\n\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out, go out\n\n\n\nTwo more footsteps on the wood floor, but it ain't you\n\nI'm faded so I bring someone home\n\nOver and over, I do this and I'm still\n\n\n\nLost in the light\n\nAnd I don't know what night it is\n\nYou're somewhere else, I'm drinking not to guess\n\nBlurry bodies, but you're on my mind\n\nWe let it go now I'm full of rum and regret\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\n\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out just so I can reforget\n\nI go out, go out"
