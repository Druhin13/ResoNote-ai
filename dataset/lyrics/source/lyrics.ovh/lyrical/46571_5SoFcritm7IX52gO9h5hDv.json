  "lyrics": "Hiding out at sea\r\nIt's getting harder and harder to breathe\r\nHiding out amid these stars\r\nThey keep waiting for me to fall apart\r\n'Cause I am like an ocean\n\nWait 'til I get older\n\nI'll be like a river\n\nWhen you're next to me\n\n\n\nI am like a landslide\n\nIt's harder when you go outside\n\nI am like an ocean\n\nI am lost at sea\n\n\n\nWill you wait for me?\n\nWhen I'm drowning will you save me?\n\nWill you wait for me?\n\nWhen I'm hurting, will you desert me?\n\nLost at sea\n\n\n\nLooking out at these waves\n\nThey keep trying to wash me away\n\nTry my best to break free\n\nShe would've held on tight and never let me leave\n\n\n\n'Cause I am just an ocean\n\nWait 'til I get older\n\nI'll be like a river\n\nWhen you're next to me\n\n\n\nI am like an earthquake\n\nIt's harder when your world shakes\n\nI am like an ocean\n\nI am lost at sea\n\n\n\nWill you wait for me?\n\nWhen I'm drowning will you save me?\n\nWill you wait for me?\n\nWhen I'm hurting, will you desert me?\n\nLost at sea\n\n\n\nAnd there are oceans filled with tidal waves\n\nAnd there people filled with so much hate\n\nAnd there are things that I cannot change\n\nSometimes I gotta get away\n\nAnd there are people that I cannot be\n\nAnd there are places that I cannot see\n\nI just want you to be here with me\n\nLost at sea\n\n\n\nI just want you to be here with me"
