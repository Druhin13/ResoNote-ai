  "lyrics": "Chills on my skin, I wanna feel that again\r\nBodies can talk, no words at all, and we said everything\r\nYeah I left tie the hands of the clock\r\nWe were just getting started babe we couldn't stop\r\nReckless, breathless in case you forgot\n\nLet me remind you\n\nMy touch can always find you\n\nFollow this my kiss will guide you\n\nIt's time to speed the way love understands\n\nLike a language you'll never forget\n\nIt can show us the way if we let it take us\n\nSo slow down I know how\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nLet me remind you\n\n\n\nLet me remind you, when we first met\n\nDo you remember 'cause I will never forget\n\nThe way you held my hand, the way you held the door\n\nThe way you held me the way no one's ever held me before\n\nWhen I wake and your face shines above me\n\nNo morning breaking like waves when you love me\n\nPulling me in all over again\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nMy touch can always find you\n\nFollow this my kiss will guide you\n\nIt's time to speed the way love understands\n\nLike a language you'll never forget\n\nIt can show us the way if we let it take us\n\nSo slow down I know how\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nMy touch can always find you\n\nFollow this my kiss will guide you\n\nIt's time to speed the way love understands\n\nLike a language you'll never forget\n\nIt can show us the way if we let it take us\n\nSo slow down I know how\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nLet me remind you\n\n\n\nGods and poets weep their diamonds\n\nWe may look down to find us\n\nTangled and shining and timeless\n\nI give 'em all to you\n\nLike the stars when they dance and align to\n\nHearts beating and breathing in time to\n\nEvery curve, every curve\n\nIt's how they designed you\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nMy touch can always find you\n\nFollow this my kiss will guide you\n\nIt's time you speed the weight up on the stands\n\nLike a language you'll never forget\n\nIt can show us the way if we let it take us\n\nSo slow down I know how\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nMy touch can always find you\n\nFollow this my kiss will guide you\n\nIt's time to speed the way love understands\n\nLike a language you'll never forget\n\nIt can show us the way if we let it take us\n\nSo slow down I know how\n\n\n\nLet me remind you\n\nLet me remind you\n\nLet me remind you"
