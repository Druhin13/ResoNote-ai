I'm trying to do RnB\n\nBut now I gotta mix it up, I'm holding two conversations\n\nDon't you know this album's 'posed to be for all the cuties\n\nNow you calling me, got me in here talking 'bout a shooting\n\nFuck it leave him clueless, I don't like to express myself\n\nFuck it he ain't do it and I know that very well\n\nYeah, once I got a call I got the beat too\n\nI couldn't finish the song and I couldn't go to sleep too\n\nWent home my brother told me something else, they creep too\n\nThat shit deep too, threw me for a loop\n\nI done got exposed to the life way too young\n\nI ain't paralyzed but the street done turned me numb\n\nLike nothing gon' even move me, but baby you make me run\n\nI'm talking murder music, and make you fall in love\n\nI'm heartless but I save you a piece\n\nHold up bae don't hang up got somebody calling me"
