  "lyrics": "I can feel it on the back of my tongue\r\nAll of the words getting trapped in my lungs\r\nHeavy like a stone, waiting for the river to run\r\nI wanna lash out\r\nI wanna let it out\n\n'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue\n\nOn the back of my tongue\n\n\n\nOh, hard to hold this fire inside me\n\nAll I know, sometimes it's frightening\n\nHard to hold this fire inside me\n\nOh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out\n\nI gotta let it out\n\nI wanna lash out\n\nI wanna lash out\n\n\n\nI got something to say, might start a riot\n\nRip that tape from my mouth, I won't be quiet\n\n'Cause everything is nothing\n\n'Til you realise it's something you want\n\n\n\nI wanna lash out\n\nI wanna let it out\n\n'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue\n\nOn the back of my tongue\n\n\n\nOh, hard to hold this fire inside me\n\nAll I know, sometimes it's frightening\n\nHard to hold this fire inside me\n\nOh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out\n\nI gotta let it out\n\nI wanna lash out\n\nI gotta let it out\n\n\n\nI can't be the cork, come out of the bottle\n\nI can't be the cork, come out of the bottle\n\nI can't be the cork, come out of the bottle\n\nI can't be the cork, come out of the bottle\n\n\n\nLash out\n\nI wanna let it out\n\n'Cause I can feel it on the back of my tongue\n\nOn the back of my tongue\n\n\n\nOh, hard to hold this fire inside me\n\nAll I know, sometimes it's frightening\n\nHard to hold this fire inside me\n\nOh, oh oh, it's not really like me to lash out\n\nI wanna let it out\n\nI wanna lash out\n\nI wanna let it out\n\nI gotta lash out"
