  "lyrics": "Did you wonder where I've been all night\r\nCouldn't help but get lost in my mind\r\nSend a postcard, send it to my friends\r\nNo number, no return address\r\nWalking and the sky keeps falling down\n\nI'm starting to notice a sound\n\nEverything around me hits the ground\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\n\n\nI've been walking out all on my own\n\nI've been losing sleep while I'm at home\n\nI don't need my leaders to decide\n\nIf I had my choice I'll speak my mind\n\n\n\nWalking and the sky keeps falling down\n\nI'm starting to notice a sound\n\nEverything around me hits the ground\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\n\n\nI can't escape you\n\nMy head keeps talking to me\n\nYou're losing me\n\nI can't escape you\n\nMy head keeps talking to me\n\nYou're losing me\n\n\n\nWalking and the sky keeps falling down\n\nI'm starting to notice a sound\n\nEverything around me hits the ground\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\nWalking and the sky keeps falling down\n\nI'm starting to notice a sound\n\nEverything around me hits the ground\n\nAnd I can't escape it\n\n\n\nMeet me at the corner of my mind\n\nIt's quiet and nothing's around\n\nFar away and I can't hear a sound\n\nI'm lost and I like it"
