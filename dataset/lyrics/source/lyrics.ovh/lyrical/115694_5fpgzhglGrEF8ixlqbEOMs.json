  "lyrics": "She left clear water in Cali\r\nTo settle down in wet mud in the valley\r\nHer eyes like a storm I want to get struck by\r\nAnd a touch so addicting like all drugs to come by\r\nKiss like poison and I'm willing to die\r\nWith a big fat smile because\n\n\n\nShe's got lips covered in honey\n\nOne with the weeds don't need money\n\nShe's fire and I want her to burn me\n\nSo baby roll one, come here and shotgun this\n\n\n\nI know you want to blow my smoke\n\nBaby just don't choke (baby just don't choke)\n\nI know you want to blow my smoke\n\nBut baby just don't choke (baby just don't choke)\n\n\n\nI'm high and I'm sitting here zoned out\n\nDriving round town in a big green smoke cloud\n\nThe windows fogged up, they refuse to roll down\n\nI'm tryin' to touch the stars and get there in no time\n\nClothes gone, lights off in a dually\n\nThe back seats the only throne that I'm ruling\n\nSo bust a blunt down and roll that love scene\n\nAnd flick my Bic, come here and smoke with me\n\n\n\nShe's got lips covered in honey\n\nOne with the weeds don't need money\n\nShe's fire and I want her to burn me\n\nSo baby roll one, come here and shotgun this\n\n\n\nI know you want to blow my smoke\n\nBaby just don't choke (baby just don't choke)\n\nI know you want to blow my smoke\n\nBut baby just don't choke (baby just don't choke)\n\n\n\nShe's got lips covered in honey\n\nOne with the weeds don't need money\n\nShe's fire and I want her to burn me\n\nSo baby roll one, come here and shotgun this\n\n\n\nI know you want to blow my smoke\n\nBaby just don't choke (baby just don't choke)\n\nI know you want to blow my smoke\n\nBut baby just don't choke (baby just don't choke)"
