  "lyrics": "I met my darkest hour, it smiled\r\nI have a hard time choosing fights\r\nMy loved ones tell me I'll be fine\r\nStill, I'm so afraid to die alone\r\nI'm so afraid to die alone\n\n'Cause I'm afraid there won't come anyone home\n\nTo find me, to find me\n\n\n\nI guess I need salvation\n\nI guess I'm wrong for failing\n\nI swallow my pride and cravings\n\nPray so I don't\n\nHave to renounce my living\n\nWon't let my reason change me\n\nCover my eyes so gently\n\nReap what I sow\n\n\n\nI cry at tills like a waste of time\n\nI think of tills like a waste of mine\n\nI'm losing sleep, I feel so high\n\nBut I'm still afraid to die alone\n\n\n\nI'm so afraid to die alone\n\n'Cause I'm afraid there won't come anyone home\n\nTo find me, to find me\n\n\n\nI guess I need salvation\n\nI guess I'm wrong for failing\n\nI swallow my pride and cravings\n\nPray so I don't\n\nHave to renounce my living\n\nWon't let my reason change me\n\nCover my eyes so gently\n\nReap what I sow\n\n\n\nI'm so afraid to die alone\n\n'Cause I'm afraid there won't come anyone home\n\nTo find me, to find me\n\nSo I flip the camera on my phone\n\nHope for a smile but he doesn't seem to like me\n\nTo like me\n\n\n\nI guess I need salvation\n\nI guess I'm wrong for failing\n\nI swallow my pride and cravings\n\nPray so I don't\n\nHave to renounce my living\n\nWon't let my reason change me\n\nCover my eyes so gently\n\nReap what I sow"
