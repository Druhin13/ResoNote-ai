  "lyrics": "I don’t always stay right on the track\r\nBut somehow I know that I’ll come back\r\nSee, I haven’t lost sight before\r\nThrough woods where cicadas scream\r\nThen along a glistening stream\n\n’Til I find the open sea\n\nLying right there for me\n\n\n\nWell, I’m not the only person looking for a clue\n\nI see by the footprints in the sand that you are too\n\nSo maybe together we can find a path that’s really true\n\n\n\nAnd civilization marches on\n\nOccasionally prone to get it wrong\n\nThough it might seem we’re lost\n\nWe never sit down too long\n\n\n\nAnd if in the distance you see me\n\nJust know this is how it’s meant to be\n\nNow I have got this far\n\nI believe in the one true path"
