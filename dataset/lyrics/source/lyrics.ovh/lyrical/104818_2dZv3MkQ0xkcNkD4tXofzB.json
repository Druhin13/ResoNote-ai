  "lyrics": "I wish I could do better by you,\r\nCos that's what you deserve.\r\nYou sacrifice so much of your life,\r\nIn order for this to work.\r\nWhile I'm off chasing my own dreams,\n\nSailing around the world,\n\nPlease know that I'm yours to keep,\n\nMy beautiful girl.\n\n\n\nAnd when you cry a piece of my heart dies,\n\nKnowing that I may have been the cause,\n\nIf you were to leave, fulfill someone elses dreams,\n\nI think I might totally be lost.\n\n\n\nBut you don't ask for no diamond rings,\n\nNo delicate string of pearls,\n\nThat's why I wrote this song to sing,\n\nMy beautiful girl"
