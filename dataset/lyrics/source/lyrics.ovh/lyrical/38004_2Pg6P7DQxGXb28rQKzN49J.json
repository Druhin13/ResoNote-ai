  "lyrics": "First light reflects off the ocean\r\nAll crew now set into motion\r\nAnother day like many before it\r\nHard life, no way to ignore it\r\nBehold! A cry from the crow's nest\r\nA ship appears from the south west\n\nThe years below deck that bored me\n\nAll lead to what lies before me\n\n\n\nHear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound\n\nFate awaits me - As the vessels circle round\n\nSee the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire\n\nFeel the anger - Raging through my body tires\n\nOne last battle - In this sailor's lonely war\n\nCome to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore\n\nI hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for\n\nDeath before the mast\n\n\n\nToo late to lay low or outrun\n\nUp close we're outmanned and outgunned\n\nPrepare to rush forth, unleash hel\n\nCross swords in one final farewell\n\nHulls crash, our vessel is boarded\n\nNo mercy or tact is afforded\n\nBut now the King's men draw closer\n\nSeems like it may all be over\n\n\n\nHear the terror - Fires burn and cannons sound\n\nFate awaits me - As the vessels circle round\n\nSee the slaughter - Cutlass swings and pistols fire\n\nFeel the anger - Raging through my body tires\n\nOne last battle - In this sailor's lonely war\n\nCome to meet this - Destiny I can't ignore\n\nI hold my breath - Close my eyes and hang on for\n\nDeath before the mast"
