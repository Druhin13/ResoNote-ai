Nigga I don't fight\nMy closest brother, he a shooter, he'll take yo' life\nI don't wanna fuck yo' bitch but Lil' Noonie might\n\nIf you got problems wit' 1-9 and wit' me it's on sight\nCatch a nigga in that whip, draw down on him\nCaught him lackin' wit that bitch, she went down for him\n'Cause she told me who you was, where you at nigga?\nWe don't do no talkin' on that net, it just flack nigga\n20 bands on my bitch, that's no cap nigga\nSpeakin' down on my gang, get you whacked nigga\nI got pills, I got drank and I tax nigga\nI got Cookie, I hit Berner for that pack nigga\nFeds already askin' questions, so don't ask nigga\nAnytime I might slide, keep a mask nigga\nDon't give a fuck 'bout where we at, ain't no pass nigga\nIn that coupe, me and my bitch, 200 on dash nigga\n\nAin't no chillin' in my hood, yeah it's bad nigga\nI know I got these haters mad, kiss my ass nigga\nFully automatic 'K wit' the strap nigga\nRicky run, Ricky run, hit yo' back nigga\nAlready know yo' bitch choosin', ain't gon' ask nigga\nOnly rock wit' Glock sticks, fuck chrome mags nigga\nYou ain't my brother, you just call me for some cash nigga\nCouple niggas turned snakes, turned rats, but it's good though\nNigga I'm still posted in that hood though\nNiggas act like I won't post up at yo' hoods though\nTime pass, act like it ain't happen, it ain't good though\nHit a nigga up and then I go all his clique though\n\nTry somethin', I still wish a nigga would\nForever thuggin', I stay posted in that hood\nNiggas talkin' like we took, like we gone or somethin'\nLike we won't pop up and put 50 to yo' dome or somethin'\nLike we don't know where you lay your head, where yo' home or somethin'\nThen everybody talkin' to me, like I'm wrong or somethin'\nLike I ain't really 'bout that beef, like it ain't on or somethin'\nLike just 'cause I'm rich I ain't runnin' round wit' that chrome or somethin'\nI think these niggas lost they mind but they better find it\nNigga you only live once, life you can't rewind it\n\nWe ain't gon' speak about when we comin', we gon' move in silence\nGot that devil in my head, they think I be wildin'\nAnd I ain't gon' play wit' niggas\nChoices already been made, so I ain't save the niggas\nIf you fuckin' wit' them suckas you gon' lay wit' niggas\nIt was once love but I guess money changed them niggas\nBut me I'm still that same nigga\nStill keep my gang nigga\nI will never change nigga\nAnd you ain't in my lane nigga\nAin't gon' argue, nothin' to say nigga\nI'm shootin' to my grave nigga"
