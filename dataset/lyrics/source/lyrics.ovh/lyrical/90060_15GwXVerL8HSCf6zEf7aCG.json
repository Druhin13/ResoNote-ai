  "lyrics": "I've always done the best I could\r\nTo get out of my neighbourhood\r\nGrowing up, I've spilt my blood\r\nBut you're still my home\r\nYou stay within my bones\r\nSaturday night on the highest wall\n\nSetting them off, all fifty fireworks\n\nKicking the cannons, we watch them fall\n\nIt doesn't exist, the law\n\n\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat\n\n\n\nMaybe it's all in my brain\n\nPeople don't look at me the same\n\nI feel weird and something's changed\n\nBut you're still my home, even though I'm alone\n\nSaturday night in the local bar\n\nKaraoke and a cracked up glitter ball\n\nBonnie and Jack just needed more\n\nYou let us down, what for?\n\n\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, no I won't be beat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat\n\n\n\nSaturday night on the highest wall\n\nSetting them off, all fifty fireworks\n\nKicking the cannons, we watch them fall\n\nIt doesn't exist, the law\n\n\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't back down, you can take a seat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, no I won't be beat\n\nYou can, you can knock me off my feet\n\nBut I won't stop now, you can take a seat"
