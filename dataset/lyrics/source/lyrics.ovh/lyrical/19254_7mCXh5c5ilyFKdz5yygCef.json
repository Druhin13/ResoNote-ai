  "lyrics": "Today I killed, he was just a boy\rEight before him, I knew them all\rIn the fields a dying oath:\rI´d kill them all to save my own\rCut me free, Bleed with me, Oh no\rOne by one, We will fall, down down\rPull the plug, End the pain, Run´n fight for life\rHold on tight, this ain´t my fight\rDeliver me from this war\rIt´s not for me it´s because of you\rDevil´s instant my eternity\rObey to kill to save yourself\rCut me free ...\r\"I envy the 9 lives that gave me hell\rMy path made up by their torn bodies\rMan to man, soldier to soldier, dust to dust\rCall me a coward but I can´t take it anymore\"\rThey wait for me far back home\rThey live with eyes turned away\rThey were the first ones to see\rThey are the last ones to bleed\r\"The ultimate high as all beautiful dies\rA ruler´s tool, priest´s excuse, tyrant´s delight...\rI alone, the great white hunter\rI´ll march till the dawn brings me rest\r10th patriot at the gallow´s pole!\"\rCut me free ..."
