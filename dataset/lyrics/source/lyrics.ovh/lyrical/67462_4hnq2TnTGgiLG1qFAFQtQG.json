  "lyrics": "When\r\nYou lose\r\nA part\r\nOf your heart\r\nDoes it make room?\r\nFor something new\n\nDoes it scar?\n\nAnd where does it run off to?\n\nA part of your heart, apart from you\n\n\n\nWas my cup so full I thought\n\nIt was empty? Oh my god\n\nI had a dream about going blind\n\nSee me selfish, see me unkind\n\nI made a big decision\n\nIt won't make my mama proud\n\nAnd be assured I am not running but\n\nEven still I can't let her down\n\nI can't let her down\n\n\n\nI'd like to avoid seeing a picture of your hand\n\n'Cause in a picture of your hand I see my old home\n\nDo you believe in God, fate, luck or chance?\n\nOr are we not supposed to know?\n\nIt's a test, it's a test\n\nIt's a test, it's a test\n\n\n\nWas my cup so full I thought\n\nIt was empty? Oh my god\n\nI had a dream about going blind\n\nSee me selfish, see me unkind\n\nI made a big decision\n\nIt won't make my mama proud\n\nAnd be assured I am not running but\n\nEven still I can't let her down\n\nI can't let her down"
