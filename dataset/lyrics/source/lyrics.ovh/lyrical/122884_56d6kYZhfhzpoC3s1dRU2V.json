(Yeah)\nHis happiness is never real (real, real, real, real)\nAnd mindless sex is how he feels, ooh, he feels\n\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time\nIt won't matter (it don't matter)\nIt won't matter (matter)\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time (time, it's time)\nIt won't matter (it won't matter)\nIt won't matter (ya)\nIt was like I was never there\n(It was like I was never there)\n\nIt was like it was more than thin air, oh\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time, oh baby\nIt won't matter, it won't matter, baby\n\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time\nIt won't matter, it won't matter\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time\nIt won't matter, it won't matter\nIt was like I was never there\nIt was like it was more than thin air\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time\nIt won't matter, it won't matter\n\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time\nIt won't matter, it won't matter\nWhen it's time, when it's time, when it's time\nIt won't matter, it won't matter\n\n\nOoh, when no one know what love is\nAnd I know it ain't you for sure\nYou'd rather something toxic\nSo, I poison myself again, again\n'Til I feel nothing\nIn my soul (in my soul)\nI'm on the edge of something breaking\nI feel my mind is slowly fadin'\nIf I keep going, I won't make it\nIf I keep going, I won't make it\n\nAnd it's all because of you\nIt's all because of you\nIt's all because of you\nIt's all because of you\nWoah, woah\nDon't you, baby, hey\n\nIt won't matter, baby\nDon't you know?\nDon't you know?\nOoh, no"
