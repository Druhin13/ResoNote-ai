  "lyrics": "Inside my mind, want you to stay\r\nBeg through my eyes, words can't explain\r\nI swim low cause I'm afraid to breathe, yeah\r\nUh uh, hairbrush, hairbrush, quietly say\r\nToo true, too much, running away\r\nYeah I'm in love with ideas of us\n\nAnd I'm in love with ideas of love, uhh\n\n\n\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\n(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love)\n\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\n(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love)\n\n\n\nTearing my muscles and rolling so hard\n\nTrying to chase something, feelings that kill me\n\nNo, don't shut me down\n\nNo, don't shut me down, no, don't shut me down\n\nNo, you know I keep on pushing and pulling at heart strings\n\nYeah, symphonies, orchestras, screaming, I'm crying so loud\n\nPromised I cried for you like a star\n\nI cried for you like a star\n\nI'd shine for you like a star\n\nSilver and gold in your arms\n\nYeah, I burn for you in the dark\n\n\n\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\n(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love)\n\nWhat if it's not meant for me?\n\nLove\n\n(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love)\n\n\n\nA few days pass since I last saw you\n\nAnd you've taken over my mind\n\nI'm retelling jokes you made that made me laugh\n\nPretending that they're mine\n\nI wanna tell the whole world about you\n\nI think that that's a sign\n\nI'm losing self control and it's you\n\nIt really is, one thousand times\n\nI look at your picture and I smile!\n\nHow awful's that! I'm like a teenage girl\n\nI might as well write all over my notebook\n\nThat you 'rock my world!'\n\nBut you do, you really do\n\nYou've turned me upside down\n\nAnd that's okay, I'll let it happen\n\n'Cause I like having you around\n\nI'm electric! A romantic clich√©!\n\nYeah, they really are all true\n\nWhen we catch eyes at that stupid party\n\nI know exactly what to do\n\nI'll take your hand, and we will leave\n\nFrench exits from me and you\n\nAnd now I'm home, a little bit drunk\n\nSome things don't change\n\nAnd I know now that\n\n\n\nMe and you were meant to be\n\nIn love\n\nMe and you were meant to be\n\nIn love\n\nMe and\n\n\n\nI see the signs of a lifetime, you till I die"
