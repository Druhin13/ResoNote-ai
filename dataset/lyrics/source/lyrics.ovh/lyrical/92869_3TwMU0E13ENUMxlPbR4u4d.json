Ayy, my thoughts\n\nDoin' what they wanna\n\nGot me thinkin' that I might can't have it like I want you, oh\n\n\n\nYou know I'm no good at reasons\n\nHold it back, I tried, it just get me deeper\n\n\n\nWe ain't gotta be awkward together, girl\n\nMaybe we're better misunderstood\n\nI been tryna be clear in my feelings, girl\n\nMaybe we're better misunderstood\n\nI been overthinkin', we ain't really even gotta name this\n\nWe'd be so much better misunderstood (Understood)\n\nWe'd be so much better misunderstood\n\n\n\nYou touch me and my whole mind just go blind\n\nTry not to think, all my thoughts point your way\n\nI'm missing you but I got no ride\n\nYou're the only one I see, so much for open minds\n\nFrightened fuckin', fuckin' frightened\n\nThat's the way we love it, damn, I love you\n\nPlayin' games just to get a reaction, pushin' buttons\n\n\n\nYou know I'm no good at reasons\n\nHold it back, I tried, it just get me deeper\n\n\n\nWe ain't gotta be awkward together, girl\n\nMaybe we're better misunderstood\n\nI been tryna be clear in my feelings, girl\n\nMaybe we're better misunderstood\n\nI been overthinkin', we ain't really even gotta name this\n\nWe'd be so much better misunderstood\n\nWe'd be so much better misunderstood, oh\n\nMaybe we're better misunderstood\n\n\n\nUnderstood, oh, oh\n\nOh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa"
