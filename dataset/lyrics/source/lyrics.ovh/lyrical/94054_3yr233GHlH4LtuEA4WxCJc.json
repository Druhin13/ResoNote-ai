  "lyrics": "(Van Morrison)\r\nTell me what do you get\r\nAt the end of the day\r\nIs it all worth the while\r\nCan you put on a smile\n\nDoes it fill you with pride\n\nAll the feelings inside\n\nOr do you just wanna hide\n\nCan you still walk away\n\nAt the end of the day\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nAre you lonely or sad\n\nDo you think you've been had\n\nIs your heart ever glad\n\nOr are you afraid\n\n'Cause you don't have it made\n\nThat you don't make the grade\n\nOr of what people say\n\nAt the end of the day\n\n\n\n[Instrumental solo]\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nIs your framework intact\n\nWhen you clean up your act\n\nDo they keep coming back\n\nDo you say follow that\n\nPat yourself on the back\n\nDo you get what you lack\n\nDo they give you respect\n\nOr is it after the fact\n\nAt the end of the day\n\n\n\nTell me what do you get\n\nIs it heartachce and pain\n\nDoes it keep coming back\n\nEverytime that it rains\n\nWhen I see you again\n\nWill it still be the same\n\nAm I really to blame\n\n'Cause I don't play the game\n\nAt the end of the day\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nGot to kneel down and pray\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nGot to kneel down and pray\n\nAt the end of the day"
