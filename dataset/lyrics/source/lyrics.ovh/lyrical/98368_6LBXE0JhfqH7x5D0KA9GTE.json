White the Devil, do you believe?\n\nScratch your head and think about it for a minute\n\nIs my life a dream and y'all playin parts in it?\n\nYou talkin like you drunken, but you flunkin\n\nClasses you be takin, let me bring home the bacon\n\nWe been hoodwinked, bamboozled\n\nLed astray, til all our business on rent in late\n\n\n\nSomewhere in your mind\n\nAnd real deep in your memory\n\nYou try to hide away\n\nYour true feelings\n\n(repeat 2X)\n\n\n\nAm I underrated? Thinkin bout it get me frustrated\n\nI'm elated, that keep it real is outdated\n\nGraduated, from PG now I'm X-Rated\n\nGlad I made it, left you behind, and you hate it\n\nLook into my eyes, do you see a nigga or a person\n\nSee I worsen, section eight got to be flirtin\n\nFuck workin, for eighty-five who you jivin?\n\nStill survivin, lock your fuckin door when I'm arrivin\n\nSurprisin realizin magnetisin\n\nThis rhyme bend how I'm risin, hypnotizin\n\nGot comments, put replies in\n\nNo lies in, if you do your life will need revivin\n\nWhen I'm sleep I die, when I wake up I'm born\n\nI leave the Earth each day to get my soul reborn\n\nSo to God I pray, I make it through this day\n\nThis must be Deja Vu, cause I relive this day\n\n\n\nSomewhere in your mind\n\nAnd real deep in your memory\n\nYou try to hide away\n\nYour true feelings\n\n(repeat 2X)\n\n\n\n[Timbaland]\n\nBring it on it, freak it on it\n\n\n\n[Magoo]\n\nChild abused, as a child\n\nChild Magoo, buck-wild\n\nWel-fare, met the cake\n\nToo much sugar, in the Kool-Aid\n\nMis-fit, un-til\n\nI fucked Jiil, on the hill\n\nLook, out, heads, up\n\nTo the girls, let's buck\n\nLike, night-shade, grows\n\nWorkin dope, mind, flows\n\nBut, please, I'm on hot\n\nI cook, non-stop\n\nStick a pin, in some paper\n\nTake notes, play ya later\n\nPraise, God, he, made ya\n\nNo, man, but, praiser\n\n\n\nSomewhere in your mind\n\nWhen you think deep in your memory\n\nYou try to hide away\n\nYour true feelings\n\n(repeat 2X)"
