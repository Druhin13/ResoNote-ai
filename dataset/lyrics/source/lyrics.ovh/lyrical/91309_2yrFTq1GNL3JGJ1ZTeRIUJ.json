  "lyrics": "Caught you wishin' at the window last night\r\nWonderin' if the moon was talkin' back\r\nI got a feelin' that you got God's ear\r\nI know I feel like He's closer when you're here\r\nIt's like you got a song in your head that nobody else knows\r\nSo just follow it baby wherever it goes\n\nIt's gonna hurt to let you go, but any go fly\n\nSo high, so high\n\n\n\nI could watch you dancin' forever\n\nTurnin' those stars into letters\n\nWrite your name in the sky\n\nWhen you laugh, when you cry\n\nJust catch that breeze like a feather\n\nTurn your tears into treasures\n\nWhen you're here, when you're gone\n\nI'll be here, lookin' on\n\nSo keep on dancin' forever\n\n\n\nThere's somethin' in the way you're lookin' right now\n\nIt's tellin' me my time is runnin' out\n\nI guess I'm waitin' on your next move\n\nAll this time I thought I was leadin' you\n\nNow look at you\n\n\n\nI Can watch you dancin' forever\n\nTurnin' those stars into letters\n\nWrite your name in the sky\n\nWhen you laugh, when you cry\n\nJust catch that breeze like a feather\n\nTurn your tears into treasures\n\nWhen you're here, when you're gone\n\nI'll be here, lookin' on\n\nSo keep on dancin' forever\n\nYeah keep on dancin' forever\n\n\n\nIt's like you got a song in your head that nobody else knows\n\nSo just follow it baby wherever it goes\n\nIt's gonna hurt to let you go, but any go fly\n\nSo high, so high\n\n\n\nI Can watch you dancin' forever\n\nTurnin' those stars into letters\n\nWrite your name in the sky\n\nWhen you laugh, when you cry\n\nJust catch that breeze like a feather\n\nTurn your tears into treasures\n\nWhen you're here, when you're gone\n\nI'll be here, lookin' on\n\nSo keep on dancin' forever\n\nYeah keep on dancin' forever"
