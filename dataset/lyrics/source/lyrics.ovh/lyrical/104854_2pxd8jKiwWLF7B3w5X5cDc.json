  "lyrics": "(Specificity)\r\n(Specificity)\r\nAnd you should try to see us live before you're dead\r\nYou need this like you need another hole in your head\r\nListen, this is how you open the set\r\nAnd when I'm done I leave it smoking, tt must be broken\n\nIt belongs at that island of trash out in the ocean\n\nTell me how you doin', how you copin'?\n\n(Specificity)\n\n\n\nShit\n\nYour paint brush might have made the stars in space\n\nBut they ain't got nothing on my partner's face\n\nI had to read it, study it, learn what I was up against\n\nBurn the older testaments of what we used to struggle with\n\nYou complain but you're still in the soaking rain\n\nHoping that she'll come and open up the drain\n\nThe years go by you grow that grain\n\nUntil you try to find a bowling lane where somebody knows your name\n\nI wish it was as simple as a sitcom, from the eighties\n\nI wanna crack jokes and raise babies\n\nWith a laugh track and \"aww\" for the shit the kids do\n\n\"Oohs\" and whistles every time that i kiss you\n\nGirl, wanna call the front desk and tell them everythings messed up\n\nThe whole world's messed up\n\nBut then i remember i've got a home I can go to\n\nCome here, let hold you\n\n\n\nI wanna show you what I've got in my mind\n\nBut i'm worried about what you might not find\n\nI guess I'm paranoid it ain't worth your time\n\n(Specificity)\n\nOoh, i don't know what the hell to do\n\nBut if I'm welcome to tell the truth\n\nI guess I wanna put a spell on you\n\n(Specificity)\n\nShit"
