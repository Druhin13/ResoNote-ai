  "lyrics": "Do I wanna be here?\r\nDo I have to?\r\nWhat a difference in life since last June\r\nGrandma told me \"slow down on the tattoos\"\r\nI'm just tryna make all my damn cash blue\r\nAnd my baby walked out, said a mistake\n\nEvery god damn town, it's the same thing\n\nI'm a fighter, don't know how to love\n\nAnd maybe that will never change\n\n\n\nTomorrow's just another day\n\nTo wash all of these fears away\n\nThought's too loud, no words to say\n\nRest your eyes, you'll be okay\n\n\n\nThere's some people in my heart who've died\n\nDrugs or to suicide\n\nThink I'm 'bout to lose my mind\n\nWhat's it mean to be alive?\n\nWhat's it mean to pray to God?\n\nIsn't that idea so odd?\n\n\n\nI'm just a skeptic, don't know how to believe\n\nAnd maybe that'll never change\n\n\n\nTomorrow's just another day\n\nTo wash all of these fears away\n\nThought's too loud, no words to say\n\nRest your eyes, you'll be okay\n\nRest your eyes, you'll be okay"
