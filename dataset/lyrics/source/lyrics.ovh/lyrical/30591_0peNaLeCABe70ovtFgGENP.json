  "lyrics": "In the silence you'll find gold\r\nWhen you feel warmth that feels so cold\r\nCan't get no sleep I'm up 'til dawn\r\nThese demons have broken my bones\r\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know that you see my life\n\nIn foreign eyes\n\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry\n\nTears tell no lie\n\n\n\nLet our guards down it's time to break the taboo\n\nBefore we all become animals, animals\n\nEchos in my head got to break the taboo\n\nNo we will never be criminals, criminals\n\n\n\nSticks and stones will break my soul\n\nGotta be your own miracle, miracle\n\nIt's in my bones got to break the taboo\n\nBefore we all become animals, animals\n\n\n\nI know that I am not alone\n\nLet all our thoughts and ghosts unfold\n\nIn the darkness I've found home\n\nBut what is next is still unknown\n\n\n\nAnd I know, and I know, and I know that you hear my cry\n\nTears tell no lie\n\n\n\nLet our guards down it's time to break the taboo\n\nBefore we all become animals, animals\n\nEchos in my head got to break the taboo\n\nNo we will never be criminals, criminals\n\n\n\nSticks and stones will break my soul\n\nGotta be your own miracle, miracle\n\nIt's in my bones got to break the taboo\n\nBefore we all become animals, animals\n\n\n\nBreak the taboo\n\nBreak the taboo\n\nBreak the taboo\n\n\n\nLet our guards down it's time to break the taboo\n\nBefore we all become animals, animals\n\nEchos in my head got to break the taboo\n\nNo we will never be criminals, criminals\n\n\n\nSticks and stones will break my soul\n\nGotta be your own miracle, miracle\n\nIt's in my bones got to break the taboo\n\nBefore we all become animals, animals"
