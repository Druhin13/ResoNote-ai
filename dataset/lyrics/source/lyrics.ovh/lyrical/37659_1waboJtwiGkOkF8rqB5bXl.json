  "lyrics": "My lovely boy, where did you go?\nCaught in the sails? I don't know\nI waved you off, eighteen years old\nYou came back angry and cold\n\nI know we haven't been the best of friends\n\nBut here's an offer now that never ends\n\nLook how far my open hand extends\n\nWe've got lots of time to make our mends\n\nOn the holidays and at weekends\n\n\n\nOh, I never really knew\n\nWhat all my brags and boasts\n\nThey must have done to you\n\nNo, I never meant to cast\n\nA shadow so opaque\n\nSo heavy, or so vast\n\n\n\nMy lovely boy, ah, there you are\n\nI knew you couldn't be far\n\nIf all's forgot, promise me then\n\nDon't ever leave me again"
