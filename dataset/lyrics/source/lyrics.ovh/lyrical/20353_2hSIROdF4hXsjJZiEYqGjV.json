  "lyrics": "Sunny days keepin' the clouds away\nI think we're coming to a clearing and a brighter day\nSo far away, still I think they say, the wait will make\ntheir heart\nGrow stronger or fonder, I can't quite remember anyway\n\n\nSo if you're waitin' for love, well it's a promise I'll keep\n\nIf you don't mind believing that it changes everything\n\nTime will never matter\n\n\n\nWinter, spring is what love can truly bring\n\nIce turns to water, water flows to everything\n\nYou can lose your mind, maybe then your heart will find\n\nI hope you won't give up what's movin' you inside, no\n\n\n\nSo if you're waitin' for love, well it's a promise I'll keep\n\nIf you don't mind believing that it changes everything\n\nTime will never matter\n\n(Time will never matter)\n\n\n\nSo if you're waitin' for love, well it's a promise I'll keep\n\nEven if you don't mind believing that it changes everything\n\nTime will never matter\n\n(Time will never matter)\n\n\n\nIf the car won't start, when you turn the key\n\nWhen the music comes on, all your cold\n\nCold heart can do is skip a beat\n\n\n\nIt's a promise I'll keep, when you're waitin' for love\n\nIf you don't mind believing that it changes everything\n\nTime will never matter\n\n(Time will never matter)\n\n\n\nSo if you're waitin' for love, well, it's a promise I'll\n\nkeep\n\nEven if you don't mind believing that it changes everything\n\nTime will never matter\n\n(Time will never matter)\n\n\n\nYour time will never matter\n\n(Time will never matter)\n\nYour time will never matter"
