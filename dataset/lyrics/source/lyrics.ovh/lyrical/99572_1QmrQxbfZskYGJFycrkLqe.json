could hold it with a shoestring\n\nThey put my youngin' on the news, looking for a Xan I got the blues\n\nWe was in there robbing niggas Locs\n\nTake him out his coat, I got his shoes\n\nI go to prison, I ain't coming home\n\nWe on a mission, niggas running home\n\nMy youngin' airing shit shit for free\n\nHe ain't want the money, stashed a couple hundred for him\n\nHe'll do it for a Rollie, take himto my jeweller know I'm a flood it for him\n\nMy vision is blurry, I just hope that I get to see thirty\n\nI pray for another moment\n\nWake up with your bitch, she ain't got nothing on\n\nI still wanna kill Freaky's killer\n\nI'm in my feelings, I won't speak to niggas\n\nMy homies dying I'ma need a minute\n\nBroad daylight, if forever running to 'em, I won't even see the witness\n\nBurned out on a Sunday, I'm high on the Oneway and I don't even see the speeding limit\n\nPac prolly had the same feelin', Biggie prolly had the same feelin'\n\nAlot of sucker shit I ain't feelin', I'm blowing sour out the Range ceilin'\n\nNiggas really got me hot, catch him in the drop, trying to leave his brains in it\n\nWe never shaky and we ain't timid\n\nYa momma lobby, I be waiting in it\n\n\n\nThey killed Mugga, I was traumatized\n\nStill that nigga in my momma's eyes\n\nTryna see a nigga momma cry\n\nAin't trying to be a homicide\n\nGot a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for\n\nBitch told me stop buying guns\n\nNiggas dying fuck you think I need 'em for\n\nThey killed Freaky, I was traumatized\n\nStill that nigga in my momma's eyes\n\nTryna see a nigga momma cry\n\nAin't trying to be a homicide\n\nGot a daughter plus a little brother and my momma that I gotta be here for\n\nHot pistol on my side warming up the ride, feeling like the heater on\n\n\n\nThey killed Ruger, bitch it's time to slide\n\nAll my niggas know it's homicide\n\nCatch 'em lacking and they gotta die\n\nI'm sending niggas to apologize\n\nI don't care if
