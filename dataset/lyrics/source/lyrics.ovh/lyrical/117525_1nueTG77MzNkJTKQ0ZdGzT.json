Of what we used to be?\n\nIs it better now that I'm not around?\n\nMy friends are actin' strange, they don't bring up your name\n\nAre you happy now? Are you happy now?\n\n\n\nI don't wanna know, know, know, know\n\nWho's taking you home, home, home, home\n\nAnd loving you so, so, so, so\n\nThe way I used to love you, no\n\nI don't wanna know, know, know, know\n\nWho's taking you home, home, home, home\n\nAnd loving you so, so, so, so\n\nThe way I used to love you, oh\n\nI don't wanna know\n\n\n\nNo more police stop\n\nNo more hashtag boo'd up screenshots\n\nNo more tryin' to make me jealous on your birthday\n\nYou know just how I make you better on your birthday, oh\n\nDo he do you like this, do he woo you like this?\n\nDo he lay it down for you, touch ya, pull ya like this?\n\nMatter fact, never mind, we don't let the past be\n\nMay be his right now, but your body's still me, woah\n\n\n\nI don't wanna know, know, know, know\n\nWho's taking you home, home, home, home\n\nAnd loving you so, so, so, so\n\nThe way I used to love you, no\n\nI don't wanna know, know, know, know\n\nWho's taking you home, home, home, home\n\nAnd loving you so, so, so, so\n\nThe way I used to love you, oh\n\n\n\nI don't wanna know, know, know, know\n\nWho's taking you home, home, home, home\n\nAnd loving you so, so, so, so\n\nThe way I used to love you, oh\n\nI don't wanna know, know, know, know\n\nWho's taking you home, home, home, home\n\nAnd loving you so, so, so, so\n\nThe way I used to love you, oh\n\nI don't wanna know"
