  "lyrics": "Just know\r\nJust know\r\nJust know, that I've missed you so, so, so\r\nBut it's a shame that I'm caught up in my own shit\r\nWith the cash flow, but you know I'll still say hello\n\nI've been so sleepless, a little too high\n\nA little too reckless, loving my life\n\nBut the thought it still drifts like a memory\n\nThink that's exactly where the end begins\n\nIt was over when I let vanity win\n\nWhen you asked where I've been\n\nWhen the money came in\n\nIt was over when I let everything go\n\nWhen I needed less loans\n\nWhen you needed me most\n\n\n\nBut I love the way you love me\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the money\n\nI love the way you love me\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the money\n\nEverything I do, you know I do it for the money\n\nEverything I say, I only say it for the money\n\nEverything is everything when everything is money\n\n\n\nMoney\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nSo go, let me show you to the door\n\nBut will you stop me? Try and fight me?\n\nIn my own home, like a heavy price tag\n\nMy god, look what happened to the critic\n\nThe only one left is the voice inside my head\n\nSaying watch them watching you forever\n\nAnd pretending that you're dead\n\nBut the rule, don't you forget it\n\nThat goodbyes are see-you-laters\n\nSo say fuck it, hold the paper\n\nWrite a check for all the haters\n\n\n\nIt was over when I let vanity win\n\nWhen you asked where I've been\n\nWhen the money came in\n\nIt was over when I let everything go\n\nWhen I needed less loans\n\nWhen you needed me most\n\n\n\nBut I love the way you love me\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the money\n\nI love the way you love me\n\nAnd I'm sorry, but it's all about the money\n\nEverything I do, you know I do it for the money\n\nEverything I say, I only say it for the money\n\nEverything is everything when everything is money\n\n\n\nMoney\n\nMoney"
