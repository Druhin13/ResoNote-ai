  "lyrics": "I came back to breathe the smoke\r\nI've got a system and I'm usin' my head (Talk that talk)\r\nClose enough to stay afloat\r\nBut you can sink with all the weight you can fit (That talk)\r\nPulled and bright, a push don't make it right\n\nLost so easily (Tell me what you're doin')\n\nTop shelf guy, supermarket price\n\nDon't think much of me (Tell me what you're doin')\n\n\n\n(Just do it) I want it all\n\nDon't stop givin', I like the way you talk\n\n(Just do it) Don't hit the wall\n\nCan't stop livin', do anythin' you want\n\n(Just do it) Ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\n(Just do it)\n\n\n\nPrecious toys don't work for play\n\nThey make a killin' sittin' out of the game (Talk that talk)\n\nMake that choice to be okay\n\nThere's nothin' to it when you're makin' it rain (That talk)\n\n\n\nTake in flight, fallin' from a height\n\nSounds the same to me (Tell me what you're doin')\n\nEyes shut tight, keepin' out the light\n\nMeans I disagree (Tell me what you're doin')\n\n(Just do it)\n\n\n\n(Just do it) I want it all\n\nDon't stop givin', I like the way you talk\n\n(Just do it) Don't hit the wall\n\nCan't stop livin', do anythin' you want\n\n(Just do it) Ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\n(Just do it) Ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\n(Just do it\n\nJust do it)\n\n\n\nDo somethin', prove somethin'\n\nNow, now, now\n\nChoose somethin', move somethin'\n\nNow, now, now\n\nDo somethin', do somethin'\n\nDo somethin', do somethin'\n\nDo somethin', do somethin'\n\n\n\n(Just do it) I want it all\n\nDon't stop givin', I like the way you talk\n\n(Just do it) Don't hit the wall, can't stop livin'\n\nDo anythin' you want\n\n(Just do it) Ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\n(Just do it) Ooh-ooh-ooh\n\nOoh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\n(Just do it)"
