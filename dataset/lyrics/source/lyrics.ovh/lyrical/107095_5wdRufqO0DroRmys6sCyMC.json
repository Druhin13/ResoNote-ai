Say you're here\r\nI can't see without your loving my dear\r\nLight your fire, feed your flame\r\nTurn to ash so I can see you again\r\nMy devotion, so controlled\n\nAnd sometimes it's too much\n\nYour words are violent, peace they silent\n\nNow I'm speaking up\n\n\n\nI see smoke [?] you faded away\n\nWhere are you my love?\n\nStanding out in the rain to see you again\n\nWhere are you my love?\n\nAre you my love\n\n\n\nAre you there? Say you're here\n\nI can't see without your loving my dear\n\nLight your fire, feed your flame\n\nTurn to ash so I can see you again\n\n\n\nMy devotion, so controlled\n\nAnd sometimes it's too much\n\nYour words are violent, peace they silent\n\nNow I'm speaking up\n\n\n\nI see smoke [?] you faded away\n\nWhere are you my love?\n\nStanding out in the rain to see you again\n\nWhere are you my love?\n\nAre you my love\n\n\n\nWhere are you my love?\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love\n\nAre you my love"
