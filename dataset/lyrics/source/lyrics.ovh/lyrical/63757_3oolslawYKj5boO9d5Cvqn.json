  "lyrics": "Behold the arrow from a Devil's bow\r\nCome cutting like a comet through the aether\r\nRisen from low lands by the gusts of yet deeper tracts\r\nA singular light in extension\r\nAscending now, on a course by will assigned\n\nTo illuminate the darkness of the mind\n\nA fire of organic divine\n\n\n\nThe fire\n\nThe fire of power\n\n\n\nA luminous procession through aeons of night\n\nEver onward 'neath the Lodestar\n\nAgainst the winds, against the law of our times\n\nKindlers 'of the flame, pilgrims of the dark\n\n\n\nWho do not fear to walk the way the vultures fly\n\nTowards destruction and doom\n\nArms outstretched and willingly consumed\n\n\n\nBy fire\n\nThe fire of power\n\n\n\n\"For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven\n\nAnd exalt my throne above the stars; until seated upon the\n\nMount of Gods, in the uttermost north:\"\n\n\n\nOn a mount overlooks the known world\n\nStands a solitary man\n\nSilent in the storm, with his bow in hand\n\nOnce a barren desert, now a sea of flames\n\nAnd eventually but embers\n\n\n\nSo the fire of power becomes the fire of the end\n\nReddening the ruins of the earth\n\nNow bow unto the merciless redeemer\n\n\n\nOf fire\n\nThe fire of power\n\nThe fire of a God"
