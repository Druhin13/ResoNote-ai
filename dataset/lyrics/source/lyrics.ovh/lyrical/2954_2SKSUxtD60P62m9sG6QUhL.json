  "lyrics": "She packed my bags last night, pre-flight\r\nZero hour: 9:00 a.m\r\nAnd I'm gonna be high as a kite by then\r\nI miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife\r\nIt's lonely out in space\r\nOn such a timeless flight\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find\n\nI'm not the man they think I am at home\n\nOh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man\n\nRocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone\n\n\n\nMars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids\n\nIn fact, it's cold as hell\n\nAnd there's no one there to raise them if you did\n\nAnd all this science I don't understand\n\nIt's just my job five days a week\n\nRocket man! Rocket man!\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find\n\nI'm not the man they think I am at home\n\nOh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man\n\nRocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find\n\nI'm not the man they think I am at home\n\nOh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man\n\nRocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone\n\n\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time\n\n(And I think it's gonna be a long, long time)\n\nAnd I think it's gonna be a long, long time"
