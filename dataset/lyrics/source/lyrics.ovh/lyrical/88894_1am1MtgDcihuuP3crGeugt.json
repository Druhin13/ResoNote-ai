  "lyrics": "Where the sun always sits slow\r\nTide always hide\r\nWhere the star stay with moon\r\nAlways in the sky\r\nDown the road where you live\r\nWith all of the people you've ever lost\n\nAnd they dance and sing, and smile\n\nWhen you arrived\n\nAnd they say\n\n\n\nI’ve been waiting for you\n\nSince the day you were born\n\nThousands of years ago\n\nHope it makes you feel like\n\nI've been waiting for you\n\nSince the day you were born\n\nThousands of years ago\n\nHope it makes you feel like home\n\nHope it makes you feel like home\n\nHope it makes you feel like\n\n\n\nIt always feels warm all the way down\n\nThere's no days, no weeks, no months\n\nNo years to go wrong\n\nNo such thing as a child of woman and man\n\nJust the voices of souls that we’ve lost will meet you again\n\nAnd they say\n\n\n\nI've been waiting for you\n\nSince the day you were born\n\nThousands of years ago\n\nHope it makes you feel like\n\nI've been waiting for you\n\nSince the day you were born\n\nThousands of years ago\n\nHope it makes you feel like home\n\nHope it makes you feel like home\n\nHope it makes you feel like home"
