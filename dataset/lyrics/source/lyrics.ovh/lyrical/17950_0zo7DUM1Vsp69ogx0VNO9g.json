  "lyrics": "Got on a plane in 'Frisco\r\nAnd got off in Vietnam\r\nI walked into a different world\r\nThe past forever gone\r\nI could have gone to Canada\n\nOr I could have stayed in school\n\nBut I was brought up differently\n\nI couldn't break the rules\n\n\n\nThirteen months and fifteen days\n\nThe last ones were the worst\n\nOne minute I'd kneel down and pray\n\nAnd the next I'd stand and curse\n\n\n\nNo place to run to\n\nWhere I did not feel that war\n\nWhen I got home I stayed alone\n\nAnd checked behind each door\n\n\n\nCuz I'm still in Saigon\n\nStill in Saigon\n\nI am still in Saigon\n\nIn my mind\n\n\n\nThe ground at home was covered in snow\n\nAnd I was covered in sweat\n\nMy younger brother calls me a killer\n\nAnd my daddy calls me a vet\n\n\n\nEverybody says I'm someone else\n\nAnd I'm sick and there's no cure\n\nDamned if I know who I am\n\nThere was only one place I was sure\n\n\n\nWhen i was still in Saigon\n\nStill in saigon\n\nI am still in saigon\n\nIn my mind\n\n\n\nEvery summer when it rains\n\nI smell the jungle, I hear the planes\n\nI can't tell no one, I feel ashamed\n\nAfraid some day I'll go insane\n\n\n\nThat's been ten long years ago\n\nAnd time has gone on by\n\nNow and then I catch myself\n\nEyes searching through the sky\n\n\n\nAll the sounds of long ago\n\nWill be forever in my head\n\nMingled with the wounded cries\n\nAnd the silence of the dead\n\n\n\n'Cuz I'm still in Saigon\n\nStill in Saigon\n\nI am still in Saigon\n\nIn my mind\n\n\n\nI am still in Saigon\n\nI am still in Saigon\n\nYes, I'm still in Saigon\n\nIn my mind"
