  "lyrics": "I can see you on internet\r\nThat’s your milieu\r\nPractically you are intimate\r\nSuds in the tub\r\nI keep up with your interests\r\nWho’s that beside you making the cut\n\nI’ll saying he’s smiling\n\n\n\nThese enhance my bad intentions\n\nWithout containing my sense of wonder\n\n\n\nLet them come crash it\n\nParty’s over\n\nNo keys and we had to smash it\n\nParty’s over\n\n\n\nRock 'n' roll bitch, I’m into it\n\nI like to show you my stuff\n\nBaby cheetahs the Himalayas\n\nWhat’s got you startled umbilical\n\n\n\nLeading hand keeps the distance\n\nSliding stance piece resistance\n\n\n\nLet them come crash it\n\nParty’s over\n\nNo keys and we had to smash it\n\nParty’s over\n\n\n\nThere was some great neighbors who found me\n\nAnd would not give up to strangers my care\n\nAway from me now\n\nThings come unhanded\n\nOff the rails some\n\nI knew you I need you too\n\nYour trying no reason to\n\nIn silence no reason given\n\nNo reason to\n\n\n\nLet them come crash it\n\nParty’s over\n\nThe season can hang beside it\n\nParty’s over\n\n\n\nAnd so it ends, and so it ends, I'm going in\n\nI'm going in, and so it ends, and so it ends"
