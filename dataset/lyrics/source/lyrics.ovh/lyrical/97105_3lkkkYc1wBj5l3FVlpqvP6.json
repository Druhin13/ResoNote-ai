  "lyrics": "Spending every moment in the studio\r\nI never said it'd be fair\r\nBut when you're all alone, I hope you truly know\r\nHow bad I want to be there\r\nCome right in, set your bag down\n\nTook a night off for you\n\nGo ahead and turn the lights off\n\nBut keep your heels on\n\nThey're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh\n\nKnow you hate explaining how you want it done\n\nJust be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl\n\nCan you work without a second for some fun?\n\nNow you finally got a moment to yourself, girl\n\nAnd I know what to do with it\n\nI know what to do with it\n\nI know what to do with it\n\nI know what to do with it\n\n\n\nI been waiting for so long to get you all alone\n\nNow I finally got you right here\n\nSo, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone\n\n'Cause I wanna make one thing clear\n\nI want you on top, so let your hair down\n\nI took the night off for you\n\nGirl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on\n\nThey're fittin' for what we're about to do\n\n\n\nCome right in, set your bag down\n\nI took a night off for you\n\nGo ahead and turn the lights off\n\nBut keep your heels on\n\nThey're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh\n\nKnow you hate explaining how you want it done\n\nJust be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl\n\nCan you work without a second for some fun?\n\nNow you finally got a moment to yourself, girl\n\nAnd I know what to do with it\n\nI know what to do with it\n\nI know what to do with it\n\nI know what to do with it\n\n\n\nOh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio"
