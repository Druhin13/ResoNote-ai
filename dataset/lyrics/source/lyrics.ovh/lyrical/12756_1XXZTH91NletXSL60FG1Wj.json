  "lyrics": "I know that we’ve been snowed in for days\r\nAnd we haven’t felt the sun\r\nStorm has come, but I feel better off when I’m alone\r\nIf we ever make it past, with nothin’ left\r\n(true love, true love, true love, true love)\n\nDon’t blame me if I’m right, you were always on your way out\n\nYou can take your time, I’ll be patient\n\nDon’t hate me if I say “If there’s something I can change”\n\nYou’d still be in love, when I come home (when I come home)\n\n\n\nI know that I’ve been closed up from you, thought it’s what I had to do\n\nLights gone out, but it feels brighter then when they were on\n\nIf we ever make it through, with nothin’ left\n\n(true love, true love, true love)\n\n\n\nDon’t blame me if I’m right, you were always on your way out\n\nYou can take your time, I’ll be waiting\n\nDon’t hate me if I say “If there’s something I would save”\n\nYou’d still be in love when I come home\n\n\n\nIt’s gotta count for something, I'll be lost and honest well\n\nDid the best with what I had, if you would count me out\n\nJust don’t count me out\n\nDon’t blame me if I run, you were always on your way out\n\nYou can take your time, I’ll be patient\n\nDon’t hate me if I say “If there’s something, I would change”\n\nYou’d still be in love, when I come home\n\nWhen I come home"
