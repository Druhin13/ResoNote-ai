  "lyrics": "I came to this world in a seaside town where the water could cool your broken body out\r\nI learned you can rise over the cards in your hand\r\nMama was a woman and a hard-workin' man\r\nNow everyone I know had to make their own bed\r\nTry to do as good as their fathers did for them\n\nI never knew mine so I bandaged the hurt\n\nI pretended that my daddy was a bank robber\n\n\n\nOh but you, you always said, \"you're just too good a ship to wreck.\"\n\nYou said, \"never mind nothin', there's a summertime humming once the bandages come off.\"\n\nYes, and you always believed there was some kind of diamond in me\n\nOh but if you still burn every night in the hurt, I know a place where the pain doesn't reach\n\nCome wander with me\n\nCome wander with me\n\n\n\nNow I tried to believe but it's so hard to know\n\nGotta do right, Rudy, with the seeds that we've sown\n\nBut the voices are loud and the miles are long\n\nAnd heroes are a hard thing to find when you're gone\n\n\n\nOh but you, you always said, \"you're just too good a ship to wreck.\"\n\nYou said, \"never mind nothin', there's a summertime humming once the bandages come off.\"\n\nYes, and you always believed there was some kind of diamond in me\n\nOh but if you still burn every night in the hurt, I know a place where the pain doesn't reach\n\nCome wander with me\n\nCome wander with me\n\n\n\nNow I hope the things that trouble me, they don't catch you or put you on your knees\n\nBut I found out time and work don't make you a man\n\nBecause time didn't teach me anything, and the working only broke my hands\n\nAnd when someday came I did not understand\n\nU-understand, understand\n\n\n\nOh but you, you always said, \"you're just too good a ship to wreck.\"\n\nYou said, \"never mind nothin', there's a summertime humming once the bandages come off.\"\n\nYes, and you always believed there was some kind of diamond in me\n\nOh but if you still burn every night in the hurt, I know a place where the pain doesn't reach\n\nCome wander with me (it's hard to sleep, I can bring you a dream, my baby, come wander with me)\n\nCome wander with me (it's hard to sleep, I can bring you a dream, my baby, come wander with me)\n\nCome wander with me (it's hard to sleep, I can bring you a dream, my baby, come wander with me)\n\nCome wander with me\n\n(it's hard to sleep, I can bring you a dream, my baby, come wander with me)\n\nCome wander with me\n\nJust past the door"
