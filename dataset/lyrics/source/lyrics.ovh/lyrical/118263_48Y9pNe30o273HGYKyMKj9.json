  "lyrics": "I need you more than you could know\r\nOoooh, oooooh, oooh\r\nAaah\r\nDon't let me down and don't let go\r\nAaah\n\nYeah\n\nYeah\n\nI say\n\nYou know I hit it almost every time and then I miss one\n\nHow we gon' get ourselves up outta this one?\n\nHard to get up from this like Sonny Liston\n\nFeel like it's Ed and Laimbeer with the Pistons\n\nBad Boys, but no Will Smith and, only real friction\n\nGot to the fork in the road, a split decision\n\nI could eat or split everything, my own decisions\n\nThat would take a little more time and more wisdom\n\nThat would take a little more grind and more vision\n\nWhat's the difference between the poor and a rich man?\n\nStandin' in line, not havin' wrist bands\n\nThese lessons you learn with no tuition\n\n\n\nHold on and ride for your own\n\nTogether in spirit form\n\nWith your hands I can hold\n\nIn your heart there is hope\n\n\n\nTime has no wait, what that has to imply who we are, who we see so much clearer now\n\nIt may not be in their sex but that don't take us out of view\n\nHold on, hold tight-hold tight\n\nHold on, if not for you then I\n\nHold on and ride for your own\n\nTogether in spirit form"
