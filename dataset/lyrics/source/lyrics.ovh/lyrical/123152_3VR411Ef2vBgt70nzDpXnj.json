  "lyrics": "There's a girl somewhere in Tupelo\r\nWho's with a guy she barely knows\r\nWho will probably sell his soul for a kiss\r\nThere's a girl somewhere in Arkansas\r\nWho's talking with a southern drawl\r\nAnd a guy who can't stop staring at her lips\n\n\n\nAnd ain't it crazy\n\nHow they make us all so crazy?\n\n\n\nWhy would we drive 600 miles one way?\n\nBlow through cash that we ain't made?\n\nGet tattoos and wash our trucks?\n\nPush and press our luck?\n\nWhy would we ask when we know we can't dance?\n\nShow our hands and change our plans?\n\nLose our minds, break our hearts?\n\nAnd learn to play guitar?\n\nWhy does any man do anything in the whole damn world?\n\nCause there's a girl\n\nCause there's a girl\n\n\n\nThere's a girl somewhere with eyes so blue\n\nYou know a call it just won't do\n\nSo here I am on Highway 45\n\nFirst girl to get me to ask myself\n\nHow I'd been with anyone else any other minute of my life?\n\n\n\nAin't it something\n\nHow they get us doing something?\n\n\n\nWhy would we drive 600 miles one way?\n\nBlow through cash that we ain't made?\n\nGet tattoos and wash our trucks?\n\nPush and press our luck?\n\nWhy would we ask when we know we can't dance?\n\nShow our hands and change our plans?\n\nLose our minds, break our hearts?\n\nAnd learn to play guitar?\n\nWhy does any man do anything in the whole damn world?\n\nCause there's a girl\n\nCause there's a girl\n\n\n\nAin't it crazy\n\nHow they get us going crazy?\n\n\n\nWhy would we drive 600 miles one way?\n\nBlow through cash that we ain't made?\n\nGet tattoos and wash our trucks?\n\nPush and press our luck?\n\nWhy would we ask when we know we can't dance?\n\nShow our hands and change our plans?\n\nLose our minds, break our hearts?\n\nLearn to play guitar?\n\nWhy does any man do anything in the whole damn world?\n\nCause there's a girl\n\nCause there's a girl"
