  "lyrics": "Feel the sadness burning in my heart\r\nYou left to early father love\r\nSo many things I should have said\r\nBut in you mind you knew it well\r\nHolding on to what I got and love\r\nBut things still seems so dark and cold\n\nThe fire is burning down my happiness\n\nBut I will rise\n\n\n\nSo proud and strong you truly was\n\nI took it with me as a tool\n\nA gift from father to his only son\n\nWatching over me with eagle eyes\n\nYou gave me freedom to a life\n\nwhere dreams are born and truly became real\n\n\n\nSee me falling, down and lonely\n\nAre the angles on their way, I'm in the dirt\n\nHear me screaming, see me bleeding\n\nCause the days no more the same without you\n\n\n\nPromise me my son you always will\n\nCherish what you love believing in\n\nNever loose your values, stand up for the day\n\nOh dear father I thank you for the years\n\nI'm writting this song on your desk\n\nTogether we can make it through the day\n\n\n\nSee me falling, down and lonely\n\nAre the angles on their way, I'm in the dirt\n\nHear me screaming, see me bleeding\n\nCause the days no more the same without you\n\n\n\nSee me falling, down and lonely\n\nAre the angles on their way, I'm in the dirt\n\nHear me screaming, see me bleeding\n\nCause the days no more the same without you\n\n\n\nSee me falling, down and lonely\n\nAre the angles on their way, I'm in the dirt\n\nHear me screaming, see me bleeding\n\nCause the days no more the same without you"
