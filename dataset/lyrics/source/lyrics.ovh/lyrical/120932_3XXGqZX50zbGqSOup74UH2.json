  "lyrics": "Every little part of me is holding on to every little piece you\r\nIs holding on to every drop of blood you drew\r\nIs holding onto you\r\nAnd every waking hour I spend\r\nHolding out for reasons not to go to bed\r\nI'm holding out for someone else to hold instead\n\nIf every hope of you is dead\n\n\n\n'Cause every night since you cut and run\n\nI feel like the only one who's ever been the lonely one\n\nTrying to mend a heart that keeps breaking\n\nWith every step that you're taking\n\n\n\n'Cause you've been running circles 'round\n\nMy mind, turning me inside out\n\nAnd I fell for you but hit the ground\n\n'Cause the only love I've known has let me\n\nDown and I need lifting up\n\nNow you ain't here I'm sleeping rough\n\nAnd I'm praying I can pray enough\n\nSo waking up without you ain’t so tough\n\n\n\nFind it hard to find my feet\n\nWhen I keep on stumbling over you and me\n\nBut I keep on trying 'cause I know I need\n\nTo outrun the memories\n\n\n\nAnd every day I'm reminded of\n\nThe way I let it come undone\n\nI feel like the lonely one, the only one with time worth wasting\n\nWell, I still can't stop chasing\n\n\n\n'Cause you've been running circles 'round\n\nMy mind, turning me inside out\n\nAnd I fell for you but hit the ground\n\n'Cause the only love I've known has let me\n\nDown and I need lifting up\n\nNow you ain't here I'm sleeping rough\n\nAnd I'm praying I can pray enough\n\nSo waking up without you ain’t so tough, oh\n\nTough, oh, tough\n\nWaking up without you\n\n\n\nSay I\n\nThought I was talking to you\n\nSay I\n\nI guess I'm talking to myself\n\nMe and nobody else\n\n\n\n'Cause you've been running circles 'round\n\nMy mind, turning me inside out\n\nAnd I fell for you but hit the ground\n\n'Cause the only love I've known has let me\n\nDown and I need lifting up\n\nNow you ain't here I'm sleeping rough\n\nAnd I'm praying I can pray enough\n\nSo waking up without you ain’t so tough"
