  "lyrics": "Call came in this morning like a thief in the night\r\nIt turned dark as hell there in the sun's sweet light\r\nThis ain't nothing like I have been told\r\nHell, the coffee in my cup's not even cold\r\nIt hit me hard but I ain't felt it yet\n\nKinda like summer storm that you just expect\n\nIt's crazy how fast a faithful heart can lose a toll\n\nHell, the cigarette I'm holding ain't half smoked\n\nThe coffee in my cup's not even cold\n\n\n\nEverything is different\n\nEverything has changed\n\nI must have been a fool\n\nTo think that things would stay the same\n\nThe only thing that's certain\n\nIs this old world keeps turning\n\nAnd you realize that you've been left behind\n\n\n\nI don't ever wanna hear this song again\n\n'Cause you were here when it first began\n\nThe melody forever will remain\n\nAnd the song ain't even sung its last refrain\n\n\n\nHell, the cigarette I'm holding ain't half smoked\n\nThe coffee in my cup's not even cold\n\n\n\nEverything is different\n\nEverything has changed\n\nI must have been a fool\n\nTo think that things would stay the same\n\nThe only thing that's certain\n\nIs this old world keeps turning\n\nAnd you realize that you've been left behind\n\n\n\nCall came in this morning like a thief in the night\n\nIt turned dark as hell there in the sun's sweet light"
