  "lyrics": "Seven days in a week\r\nEat a steak every plate it's a feast\r\nWatch your weight no mistakes in the least\r\nOr else you too will dig a grave with your teeth\r\nI wish I that I could fit in these expensive genes\r\nA waistline that'll rip the seams\n\nAnd pharmaceuticals that sit between ya heart medicine\n\nCough medicine blood thinners and antihistamines\n\nWe got the ocean front view\n\nBut scope is so limited\n\nCause young niggas be dying of old nigga shit\n\nWifey sleeping in the guest room cause you snore at night\n\nIt’s like 40 years old is 3/4 life\n\nOur biggest fears were shots or armed robbery\n\nNow the biggest fears are clots and oncology\n\nGot a sleep app to tell you you got sleep apnea\n\nHe all in your sheets with a CPAP\n\nWish that I could fit in these expensive genes\n\nI don’t like this cut it’s like the Lord got my order wrong\n\n3am stress eating laying down on it\n\nNow ya blood sugar is borderline Bordelon\n\nSeen em rise I seen em fall\n\nI’ve seen the dreams of fiends and scenes of war\n\nInside my mind it ain’t nothin serene it’s called Blackness\n\nThe most expensive gene of all"
