  "lyrics": "Sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of this life\r\nI found the price of love and lost my mind\r\nI will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights\r\nI'd do it all again and won't think twice\r\nOh, think twice\n\nAre you devil? Are you angel?\n\nAm I heaven? Am I hell?\n\nI can barely find the proof to save myself\n\nAre you water? Are you fire?\n\nAre you filthy? Are you pure?\n\nOh, I thought by now I'd know\n\nBut I'm not sure\n\n\n\nWell, you're no angel\n\nI never asked you to be\n\nYou're my danger 'cause that's just what I need\n\nBut it still hurts me\n\n\n\nWell, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life\n\nI found the price of love and lost my mind\n\nI will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights\n\nI'd do it all again and won't think twice\n\nOh, think twice\n\n\n\nMy forever and my end\n\nMy forgiveness and my sin\n\nI have sacrificed the most of my youth\n\nIs it treason? Is it true?\n\nThat the worst I won't undo\n\nOnly enemy I have in love is you\n\n\n\nWell, you're no angel\n\nI never asked you to be\n\nYou're my danger 'cause that's just what I need\n\nBut it still hurts me\n\n\n\nWell, sometimes I wonder what is the meaning of my life\n\nI found the price of love and lost my mind\n\nOh, I will forgive them all of my wrongs and my rights\n\nI'd do it all again and won't think twice, no\n\nWhoah, think twice\n\n\n\nWere you devil? Were you angel?\n\nIt's too late to change my mind\n\nI would do it all again and not think twice"
