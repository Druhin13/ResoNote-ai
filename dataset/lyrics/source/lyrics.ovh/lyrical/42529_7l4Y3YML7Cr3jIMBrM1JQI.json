  "lyrics": "There's a me in there somewhere\r\nBetween the passion and the pain\r\nBetween the stars and the heavens\r\nWithin three long wasted days\r\nThere's a me in there somewhere\n\nHe's all black-eyed and blue\n\nFrom the man I keep fighting\n\nBut he was fighting for you\n\n\n\nOh, forgive me\n\nPlease, forgive me\n\n\n\nThere's a me in there somewhere\n\nBut he ain't towing the line\n\nI used to let 'em down easy\n\nAnd now it happens every time\n\nAnd now the me has gotten lost there\n\nTrying to find my way home\n\nBefore the sun sets behind me\n\nIn the darkness I roam\n\n\n\nOh, forgive me\n\nPlease, forgive me\n\n\n\nBut there's one thing for certain\n\nSometimes lives drift apart\n\nBut the me on the inside\n\nRemembers the purest of hearts\n\n\n\nThere's something telling the victim\n\nBut the victim is you\n\n\n\nForgive me\n\nBehold the outside\n\n\n\nLife is long, don't forget that\n\nGod knows I've tried\n\nAnd you deserve so much better\n\nThan the me on the inside\n\nYou were the light and you proved to be right\n\nYou kept me steadfast and true\n\nNow the me on the inside\n\nForever believes in you\n\n\n\nOh, forgive me\n\nPlease, forgive me\n\nForgive me\n\nPlease, forgive me"
