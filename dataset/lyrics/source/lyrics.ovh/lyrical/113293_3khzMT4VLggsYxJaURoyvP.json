  "lyrics": "There's a front porch swing at your Momma's house\r\nAnd a little stream up in the mountains\r\nA shotgun seat and a, ocean breeze\r\nThere's a ferris wheel just spinnin' 'round\r\nA midnight moonlight shining down\r\nA red sunset in a cotton dress\n\n\n\nYou're in it\n\nEvery single good time\n\nWhen I press rewind in my mind yeah I find\n\nYou're in it\n\nEvery thought of what could be\n\nAll I see is you and me\n\nIn my dreams and everything\n\nI don't know what the future holds\n\nAll I know is girl you're in it\n\n\n\nThere's a small town cafe corner booth\n\nWhere I first laid my eyes on you\n\nA melody that I keep singing\n\nThere's a baptist church on a county road\n\nWith everyone that we both know\n\nThere's wedding bells and a long white veil\n\n\n\nYou're in it\n\nEvery single good time\n\nWhen I press rewind in my mind yeah I find\n\nYou're in it\n\nEvery thought of what could be\n\nAll I see is you and me\n\nIn my dreams and everything\n\nI don't know what the future holds\n\nAll I know is girl you're in it\n\nYeah, girl you're in it\n\n\n\nFifty years on down the line\n\nThere's a rocking chair right next to mine\n\nAnd girl you're in it\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nYou're in it\n\nEvery single good time\n\nWhen I press rewind in my mind yeah I find\n\nYou're in it\n\nEvery thought of what could be\n\nAll I see is you and me\n\nIn my dreams and everything\n\nI don't know what the future holds\n\nAll I know is girl you're in it\n\nYeah, girl you're in it\n\nOh, girl you're in it\n\nYeah, you're in it"
