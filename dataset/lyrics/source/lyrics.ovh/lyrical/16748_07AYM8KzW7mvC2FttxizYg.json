  "lyrics": "She leans and slow pulls the meat off the bones and it never tasted so sweet before\r\nBut she never tried the wings that fried outside\r\nAnd her mind once slow, that's like she knows and my head can't take it like this no more\r\nAnd her mother tried to win so eye's like mine\r\nYou know, my bones cradle domes too slow for sure\n\nBut it grows far below\n\nShallow groans have grown my throne\n\n\n\nShe leaned in time, as fast as she liked\n\nAnd her feet weren't moving like this before\n\nI guess her mother must have changed her mind, in time\n\n\n\nYou know, my bones cradle domes too slow for sure\n\nBut it grows far below\n\nShallow groans have grown my throne\n\n\n\nFor so long I wouldn't wait\n\nBut place me lately, for so good I wouldn't save me\n\nRun me lately\n\nI'm craving the concrete lately\n\nI've grown my throne\n\n\n\nYou know, my bones cradle domes too slow for sure\n\nBut it grows far below\n\nShallow groans have grown my thrown\n\nMy throne, my throne\n\nOutgrown my throne\n\nSave me, run me baby\n\nI'm craving the concrete lately\n\nOutgrown my throne\n\nSave me, run me baby\n\nI'm craving the concrete lately\n\nOutgrown my throne"
