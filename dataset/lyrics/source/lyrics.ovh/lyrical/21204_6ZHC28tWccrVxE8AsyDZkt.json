  "lyrics": "Looking at the sky at night\r\nLittle bitty circles of light\r\nYou point out a constellation that you like\r\nAnd tell me all about it\r\nCause you know about it\n\nAnd I love that you know stuff like that\n\nLove that the little things means so much\n\nThat's why I'm always smiling\n\nI swear I smile my face off\n\nLet me kiss you face off\n\nRight before we take off\n\n\n\nIn this rocket (of love)\n\nIn this rocket (of love)\n\nAnd you got me so high\n\nHigher than I ever been\n\nAnd you got me so high\n\nHigher than I ever been\n\nUp in the stars with you\n\nUp in the stars with you\n\nUp in the stars with you\n\nUp in the stars\n\n\n\nDarker than I've ever seen ya\n\nDon't think I ever felt so small\n\nBut darkness never felt so bright\n\nAnd in your arms\n\nIt's hard to feel afraid at all\n\nOn your neck I feel your breath\n\nChills up my spine\n\nFeels I'm in mine\n\nAll the time\n\nThat's why I'm always smiling\n\nI swear I smile my face off\n\nLet me kiss you face off\n\nRight before we take of\n\n\n\nIn this rocket (of love)\n\nIn this rocket (of love)\n\nAnd you got me so high\n\nHigher than I ever been\n\nAnd you got me so high\n\nHigher than I ever been\n\nUp in the stars with you\n\nUp in the stars with you\n\nUp in the stars with you\n\nUp in the stars\n\n\n\nWell if this world don't understand the love\n\nThat we share between us babe\n\nOh then we'll fly away\n\nFly away and just find one that does\n\n\n\nIn this rocket (of love)\n\nIn this rocket (of love)\n\nAnd you got me so high\n\nHigher than I ever been\n\n\n\nAnd you me so high\n\nHigher than I ever been"
