  "lyrics": "Please be careful what you say\r\nI may die this way\r\nBe careful how your mouth pulled apart\r\nI can see your lips, I don't wanna feel your heart\r\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike you do when you tell the truth\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike I need you to do so I can hear you say\n\nSomething that sounds right\n\n\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike you do when you tell the truth\n\n\n\nPlease be careful what you say\n\n'Cause if I split in two you will be to blame\n\n'Cause I know nothing better and nothing worse\n\nAnd how you twist your letters into words\n\n\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike you do when you tell the truth\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike I need you to do so I can hear you say\n\nSomething that sounds right\n\n\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike I need you to do when you tell the truth\n\nAnd tell me what to believe, and tell me what to deny\n\nAnd whisper into my ear till everything dark turns bright\n\n\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike you do when you tell the truth\n\nSlowly lie to me\n\nLike I need you to do so I can hear you say\n\nSomething that sounds right"
