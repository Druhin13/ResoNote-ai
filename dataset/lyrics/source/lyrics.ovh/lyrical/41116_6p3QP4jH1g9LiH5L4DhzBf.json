  "lyrics": "Cold linoleum just seems to amplify\r\nEvery sob, every sound, every sigh\r\nDown at the bus station waiting for the red eye\r\nTears of a stranger no method to this madness\r\nNo proof of sadness\r\nDo you steer clear\n\nOr do you turn around\n\n\n\nHome's waiting like a motherless child\n\nFrom the chaos we're thrown into the wild\n\nIn an instant it could all go away\n\nOr we could choose to keep holding on to the pain\n\n\n\nDo you steer clear\n\nWide glances in the cracked and dirty mirrors\n\nOne last time\n\nConsole the town and their future\n\nAs it slides away"
