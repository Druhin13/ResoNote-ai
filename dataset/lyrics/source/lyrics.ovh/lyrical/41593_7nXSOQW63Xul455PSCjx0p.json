  "lyrics": "Don't you remember the nights in December\r\nThe booze and the mates and the fenders\r\nOf the band you thought was sick\r\nDon't you remember the way that girl looked at you\r\nWhile you held her hair while she puked in the loo\r\nAnd still kissed her anyway\n\n\n\nSo tell me one more time\n\nThat I've been trashing your bedtime\n\nI hear you knock, knock, knock\n\nOn the door and you let me know\n\nPipe down, it'll have to go\n\n\n\nBaby don't tell me you're too old\n\nTo have a little bit of fun sometimes\n\nSlow down and dance awhile\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nBaby don't tell me you don't get why\n\nI need my friends and a bottle and a guy\n\nForget the day, I love the night\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\n\n\nDon't you remember the lines and the beer cans\n\nThe shouts and the screams and the naughty hands\n\nIn your mates bedroom\n\nDon't you remember not washing for a week or a two\n\nThe neighbors have said they hated you\n\nCause newsflash, that's you\n\n\n\nDon't tell me one more time\n\nHow I've been trashing your bedtime\n\nI hear you knock, knock, knock\n\nOn the door and you let me know\n\nPipe down, it'll have to go\n\n\n\nBaby don't tell me you're too old\n\nTo have a little bit of fun sometimes\n\nSlow down and dance awhile\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nBaby don't tell me you don't get why\n\nI need my friends and a bottle and a guy\n\nForget the day, I love the night\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\n\n\nIt's bedtime on your floor\n\nTurn off the lights but your eyes want more\n\nNot bedtime on our floor\n\nWe making noise and your mind wanders\n\nDo you think you're a bore, we're a chore\n\nDo you never miss passing out on your floor?\n\nMister, do you wanna talk?\n\nSomething tells me you don't want this anymore\n\n\n\nSo tell me one more time\n\nThat I've been trashing your bedtime\n\nI hear you knock, knock, knock\n\nOn the door and you let me know\n\nPipe down, it'll have to go\n\n\n\nBaby don't tell me you're too old\n\nTo have a little bit of fun sometimes\n\nSlow down and dance awhile\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nBaby don't tell me you don't get why\n\nI need my friends and a bottle and a guy\n\nForget the day, I love the night\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime\n\nMister 10 PM bedtime"
