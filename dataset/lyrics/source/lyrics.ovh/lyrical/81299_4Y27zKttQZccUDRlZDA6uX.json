  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Idol par W.A.S.P\r\nWill I be alone this morning\n\nWill I need my friends ?\n\nSomething just to ease away my pain\n\nNo one ever sees the loneliness behind my face\n\nI am just a prisoner of my fame\n\nIf I could only stand\n\nAnd stare in the mirror\n\nWhat could I see ?\n\n\nOne fallen hero with a face\n\nLike me\n\nAnd if I scream would anybody hear me\n\nIf I smash the silence, you'll see what fame\n\nHas done to me\n\nKiss away the pain and leave me lonely\n\nI'll never know if love's a lie, ooh\n\nBeing crazy in paradise is easy\n\nDo you see the prisoners in my eyes ?\n\n\nWhere is the love to shelter me ?\n\nGive me love, love set me free\n\nWhere is the love to shelter me ?\n\nOnly love, love set me free\n\nSet me free"
