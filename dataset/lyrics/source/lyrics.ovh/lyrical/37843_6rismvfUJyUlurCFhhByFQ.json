  "lyrics": "I took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.\nI can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, I was no babe in the wild, wild wood.\nShe didn't mean it, I should have seen it, but now it's too late.\nI thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, now it seems, this is how the story ends:\n\nShe's gonna turn me down and say, \"Can't we be friends?\"\n\nI thought for once it couldn't go wrong, not for long, I can see the way this ends:\n\nShe's gonna turn me down and say, \"Can't we be friends?\"\n\nWhy should I care though she gave me the air,\n\n\n\nWhy should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why, and wonder why?\n\nI thought I found the gal I could trust, watta bust, this is how the story ends:\n\nShe's gonna turn me down and say, \"Can't we be just friends?\""
