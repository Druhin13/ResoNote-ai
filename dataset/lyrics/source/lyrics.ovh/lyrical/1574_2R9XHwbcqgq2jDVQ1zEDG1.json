  "lyrics": "Where does your body go when I leave you alone?\r\nWould your heart know if I met you in a brand new set of bones?\r\nÂ‘Cause you may see me in different bodies\r\nHiding below with the same soul\r\nI could have walked by you a thousand times\n\nDifferent places, different lives\n\nI could have been someone you don't recognize\n\nDifferent figure, new design\n\n\n\nI'm just a body that you used to know\n\nI'm just somebody that you used to know\n\nI'm just a body that you used to know\n\nUsed to know, used to know, used to know\n\n\n\nWhere did your heart stay in all those years away?\n\nDid I make your voice shake?\n\nCould you feel me riding through the airwaves?\n\nIn all those yesterdays were you always hiding below?\n\nNo, I didn't know\n\n\n\nI think we've loved a thousand lives\n\nI try to find you every time\n\nSearching for those same wide eyes\n\nThat locked me in, in my first life\n\nDo you remember my old names?\n\nRecognize my other face?\n\nWe're both hanging in picture frames\n\nSomewhere in this place\n\nBut my stare at you stayed the same\n\n\n\nI'm just a body that you used to know\n\nI'm just somebody that you used to know\n\nI'm just a body that you used to know\n\nUsed to know, used to know, used to know\n\n\n\nI think we've loved a thousand lives\n\nI try to find you every time\n\nI think we've loved a thousand lives\n\nI try to find you every time\n\n\n\nI'm just a body that you used to know\n\nI'm just somebody that you used to know\n\nUsed to know, used to know, used to know\n\n(I think we've lived a thousand lives)\n\nI'm just somebody that you used to know\n\n(I try to find you everytime)\n\nI'm just somebody that you used to know\n\n(I try to find you everytime)\n\nI'm just somebody that you used to know\n\nUsed to know, used to know, used to know"
