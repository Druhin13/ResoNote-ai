  "lyrics": "Deep beneath the fallen leaves\r\nThe old tin roofs and the dead swamp trees\r\nThe sound of red bogs, rattlin' chains\r\nRebel flags by the dozen doin’ a truck bed dance\r\nThat firewater drippin' in a couple glass jugs\r\nDouble barreled shotgun full of them slugs\n\nGot scars on our knuckles, come get you some\n\nThere ain't no mistaken where we all come from\n\n\n\nWe from the country, the hollars and hills\n\nIf you wanna drive chains come snatch my gears\n\nIn the country, where we all down the road\n\nDon’t start no shit on my one lane road\n\nIn the country, oh-oh-oh in the country\n\n\n\nYeah boy\n\nHillbilly deluxe, thick chicks with big butts\n\nCamouflaged 250 with the chromed out nuts\n\nGun racks, big guns, roughnecks, sunburnt\n\nMake a city boy say \"Bubba we ain't want none\"\n\nDamn right you don't want it 'cause we come by the pack\n\nSquare body Chevys and some white boys with some tats\n\nI got a pistol like the one from Dirty Harry you know\n\nNo permit but I still pack it everywhere that I go\n\nSo watch me stomp in the dust, square dance on the game\n\nJam out to Chattahoochee while I sip on the drink\n\nSo here's my motherfuckin' middle finger, you can give it to fame\n\nHollywood ain't for me if you know what I'm sayin’\n\n\n\nWe from the country, the hollars and hills\n\nIf you wanna drive chains come snatch my gears\n\nIn the country, where we all down the road\n\nDon’t start no shit on my one lane road\n\nIn the country, oh-oh-oh in the country\n\n\n\nHell yeah\n\nBunch of redneck, rough face, hard lookin' ass\n\nCame from the wrong side of the motherfuckin’ tracks\n\nThat's no lie Bubba, that's the way of life 'round here\n\nGot a problem then we fuckin’ scrap\n\nHillbillies on the front porch bumpin' our shit\n\nOld cars in the front yard needin' to be fixed\n\nOld dog chained to a big tree in the back\n\nTalk shit if you want, he was trained to attack\n\nI was raised the same way, by my grandfather around the way\n\nHe taught me how to use a gun, aim bang bang\n\nGot that barrel smokin' leave you open, you just hopin' you don't die\n\nDon't approach him you'll be chokin' from the smoke when bullets fly\n\nI'd rather be calm like the leaves in the fall\n\nWatch 'em change colors on the front porch with my dog\n\nListen up real close I'mma say this one time\n\nCountry ain't just a state, it's my state of mind\n\n\n\nWe from the country, the hollars and hills\n\nIf you wanna drive chains come snatch my gears\n\nIn the country, where we all down the road\n\nDon't start no shit on my one lane road\n\nIn the country, oh-oh-oh in the country\n\n\n\nIs any rednecks in the house?\n\nThey don't really want it man, it must be a joke\n\nWe gettin' jiggy in the boonies, you can tell from the smoke\n\nLightin' the flame to this whole god damn thing\n\nJust crank it up loud and you can see what I'm sayin'\n\nAnd keep an open mind, we got a class to teach\n\nIt ain't no Panama City but more bikinis than the beach\n\nEnough hillbillies to invade our whole city\n\nMSNBC said 12 million at least\n\nAnd that's twice as many boots stompin' straight on that ass\n\nAnd that's twice as many trigger fingers ready to blast\n\nI got my work clothes on, campfire cologne\n\nWe rollin' deep off in this bitch, Calhoun, Church, Jones\n\n\n\nWe from the country, the hollars and hills\n\nIf you wanna drive chains come snatch my gears\n\nIn the country, where we all down the road\n\nDon't start no shit on my one lane road\n\nIn the country, oh-oh-oh in the country"
