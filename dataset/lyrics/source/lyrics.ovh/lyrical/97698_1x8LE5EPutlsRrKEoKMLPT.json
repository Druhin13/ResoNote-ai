  "lyrics": "Uh, yeah\r\nSee I'm a walking, talking, barking, biting, fighting\r\nLightning in a bottle, Chevrolet golden model\r\nCrystal glass full of Creek water when I wobble\r\nPast the keys to the valley and hit the bundle\r\nRidin' vacant, draggin', scrapin', blowin' sparks over\n\nCrossover laws, we jumpin', bumpin' Trunk Muzik\n\nI lose it, I use it, I drink it, I hank it\n\nI wail and I willy, I'm dangerous\n\nAim for the ankles and this bitch's throat\n\nWho in the fuck is this here with the flows?\n\nCatfish Billy got that pocket, homie\n\nI'm a rocket, homie, I don't think slow\n\nBut I sink low in that bucket seat, low fashion is luxury\n\nIf I want it, fuck it, fuckin' yeah, I get it\n\nI must be living on fucking street\n\nDid you poke at that Robert Van Winkle?\n\nHanging down over his mink coat\n\nI come alone from a known mobile home\n\nI could roll you a cone with no wrinkles\n\nChevrolet hit with the sprinkles, got an El Camino after Cinco\n\nSmurf Box Chevy like bingo, I got this bitch\n\n\n\nRunnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nI smashed up the gray one, bought me a red\n\n\n\nSee I do all the reppin', North Atlanta legend\n\nNo piano lessons, I know how to push a key\n\nWasn't on the Freshmen cover\n\nGuess that XXL wasn't thinking I was good enough to be\n\nRate me one to seven, I'm eleven\n\nIn my Chevy with your lovie and her best friend\n\nMake her g-string wetter than a headband\n\nSee me on the road and turn around and get a neck cramp\n\nLook at your reflection, paint like I sparked the stars\n\nShinin' like a diamond, inside of my Audemar\n\nShe blow a dick like muah\n\nMade her squirt all over the seat, now I gotta wash the car\n\nIt's like I dived on the slide of the water park\n\nHer pussy was gushy, I dropped her off\n\nOn the steps like I had a job at UPS\n\nTold her call me but every time we bark, I yawn\n\nI went and parked my car, they come lift it\n\nAnd I'm fuckin', I'll fuckin' fuck a soccer mom\n\nOr some dork bitch dressing up for Comic-Con\n\nThe Chevy bouncing like it had a hydraulic pump\n\nThe T-tops are gone, I speed off like a redneck screaming yeehaw\n\nThese laws probably seesaw, bring in police stars\n\nAll they retrieve underneath the seat was a big pink double-D bra\n\nThat a big broad must've worn, I don't recall\n\nBut they tryna give me tickets like I won at Skee-Ball\n\nIn a black Monte Carlo, strapped like a narco\n\nRiding through Atlanta bumpin' Tennessee love\n\nReppin' CNT, but believe I'ma be Slum 'til I'm 6 feet deep in the ground\n\nUp in my box Chevy speedin' off when I see the GCP dig around and I be...\n\n\n\nRunnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nI smashed up the gray one, bought me a red\n\n\n\nIn my box Chevy runnin', you in a Cutlass\n\nBut my dope cut less, pass it like judgement\n\nWet pain and it's gutted, police say I'm up to something\n\nPut the thirties on that bitch, tell 'em you gotta look up to something (Yeah)\n\nThis for the homies that keep money down in they sneaker box, that fast cash\n\nIn the trunk of my Box Chevy I keep me a speaker box like Outkast\n\nPeople tryna get me for it, they staking out like out bag\n\nBut I got some killers that's in the front yard and I got some killers that's out back\n\nThere's something in my Box that'll put you in a box\n\nGot your ho in my Box Chevy 'cause I'm fucking with her box\n\nI beat the song of the year with a freestyle, who run it?\n\n20 years in the gangster doing laps, and I got this bitch\n\n\n\nRunnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nWe got this bitch runnin' (Runnin'), runnin' (Runnin'), runnin', runnin', runnin' out\n\nI smashed up the gray one, bought me a red\n\n\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nEvery time we hit the parking lot, we turn heads\n\nI smashed up the gray one, call me a red"
