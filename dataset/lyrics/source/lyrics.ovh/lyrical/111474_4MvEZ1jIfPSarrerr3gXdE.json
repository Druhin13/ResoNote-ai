  "lyrics": "Gonna raise up a tall glass\r\nTonight as we look back\r\nBack on all the life that we lived through\r\nYeah, the things that we drink to\r\nRoads that we choose, friends that we make\n\nTurns that we miss and the hearts that we break\n\nThe words that we say and the ones that we don't\n\nLines that we cross and the ones that we won't\n\nTears that we cried, the dreams that we dreamed\n\nStars that burnt out and the stars that we reached\n\nThe pictures we take, the stories they tell\n\nAnd the moments we keep for ourselves\n\n\n\nGonna raise up a tall glass\n\nTonight as we look back\n\nBack on all the life that we lived through\n\nYeah, the things that we drink to\n\n\n\nShed a little light on a memory\n\nKinda makes it feel like you're with me\n\nI'm still a little lost here without you\n\nYeah, the things that we drink to\n\n\n\nThe hurt that we heal, the songs that we sing\n\nThe hope that we know tomorrow can bring\n\nThe battles we fight, the wars that we win\n\nThe pain that we been through\n\n(Things that we drink to)\n\n(Things that we drink to)\n\n\n\nGonna raise up a tall glass\n\nTonight as we look back\n\nBack on all the life that we lived through\n\nYeah, the things that we drink to\n\n\n\nWe can wonder where all the time goes\n\nBut it don't change a thing though\n\nAll I'm tryna say is I miss you\n\nYeah, the things that we drink to\n\n\n\n(Things that we drink to)\n\n(Things that we drink to)\n\n\n\nAll I'm tryna say is I miss you\n\nYeah, the things that we drink to"
