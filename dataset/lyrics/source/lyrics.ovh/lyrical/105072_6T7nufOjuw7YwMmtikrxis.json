  "lyrics": "Oh.\r\nLove of mine,\r\nWon't you lay by my side,\r\nAnd rest your weary eyes,\r\nBefore we're out of time,\n\nGive me one last kiss,\n\nFor soon, such distance,\n\nWill stretch between our lips,\n\nNow the day's losing light.\n\n\n\nOh.\n\n\n\nBring me your love, tonight.\n\nBring me your love, tonight.\n\n\n\nLost at sea,\n\nMy heart beat is growing weak,\n\nHoping you'd hear my plea,\n\nAnd come save my life,\n\nAs the storm grew fierce,\n\nAn angel was certainly near,\n\nI knew there was nothing to fear.\n\n\n\nBring me your love, tonight.\n\nBring me your love, tonight.\n\nNo I am not where belong,\n\nBring me your love, tonight.\n\n\n\nNo I am not where I belong,\n\nSo shine a light and guide me home.\n\nNo I am not where I belong,\n\nSo shine a light, guide me back home.\n\n\n\nOh"
