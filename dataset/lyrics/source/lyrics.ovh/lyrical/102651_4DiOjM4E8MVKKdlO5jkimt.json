  "lyrics": "I had a dream that you came to me shining down\r\nThrough the clouds like a moonbeam\r\nThere you were\r\nAnd you wore nothing more than your raven hair\r\nIn the air like a moonbeam\r\nHere you were\n\n\n\nAnd you pulled me from a nightmare\n\nWith your eyes and your silver touch\n\nShone a little bit of light there\n\nNow the darkness don’t scare me much\n\n\n\nLa da da da\n\nLa da da da\n\n\n\nYou can feign your surprise, give me those doe eyes\n\nBut I know I wanna love you\n\nYes I do\n\nWe can dance to the beat while I tap my feet\n\nOn the stars, you’re gonna like me\n\nYes you are\n\n\n\nWhen you saved me from a bad dream\n\nI was drifting through time and space\n\nBut I landed on a moonbeam\n\nTake me out of this place\n\n\n\nThe world is dark the night is long\n\nI could use a few laughs and a couple of songs\n\nThe sun will rise above the hills\n\nYou’ll be leaving me soon, like hell you will\n\nThe owl gazing at the moon\n\nIs the feeling that I get when I’m lookin’ at you\n\nThe sun will rise and fade the stars\n\nAnd you’re leaving me soon, like hell you are\n\nAnd you’re leaving me soon, like hell you are\n\n\n\nLa da da da\n\nLa da da da\n\n\n\nI had a dream that you came to me shining down\n\nThrough the clouds like a moonbeam\n\nThere you were\n\nI had a dream that you came to me shining down\n\nThrough the clouds like a moonbeam\n\nThere you were"
