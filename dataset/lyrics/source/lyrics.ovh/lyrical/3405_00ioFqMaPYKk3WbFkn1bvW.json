  "lyrics": "It's the last time that I ask why\r\nI'm overlooked and I'm passed by\r\nCan't grasp my shit, that's fine\r\nCan't see the truth through glass eyes\r\nYou're half-blind; in fact, I'm\r\nOn my way to the back nine\n\nI'm coming out swinging a man on a mission\n\nAnd breaking new ground like a land mine\n\nCan't stop my ambitions, can't stop my commitment\n\nMy very existence is winning the game\n\nEvery minute I'm given I'm thinking\n\nOf living it different, you live it the same\n\nA vivid display, what are you thinking?\n\nI'm building a vision, you're digging a grave\n\nI'm in a position to have an opinion\n\nDon't need your permission to give it away\n\nGive it a rest, this is the end\n\nYou cannot prevent what you're fighting against\n\nWe live in this shit, we didn't pretend\n\nWe're the percentage you'll never forget\n\nLook at the math, look at what's left\n\nYou can't represent what you couldn't accept\n\nSince the beginning, I knew you were ignorant\n\nThat is the difference you can't understand\n\nWhat would you do with nothing to lose\n\nNothing to live for but something to prove?\n\nYou don't have a clue, you got it confused\n\nYou couldn't walk 20 steps in our shoes\n\nEvery minute you're ducking from view\n\nCan't run from the truth that's coming for you\n\nWe are the many and you are the few\n\n\n\nWe are the future, we are the future\n\nWe're the future and we have just begun\n\nWe are the truth, the chosen ones\n\nWe are the new, the past is gone\n\nWe are the future and we have just begun\n\nWe are the future\n\n\n\nIt's a new day and a new way\n\nThe future brings a new game\n\nA view change, a crusade\n\nIt's a journey to the new age\n\nSo you may want to take\n\nThis time to pack a suitcase\n\nWe're coming, you're going 'cause we are the chosen\n\nYeah, this is our moment, you're too late\n\nThat's it, I have spoken, I told you it's hopeless\n\nYou thought I was joking but when did I laugh\n\nThe smile you noticed was me overflowing\n\nFrom joy and emotion from ending the past\n\nSending it back, like something was open\n\nLike something was broken, it went in the trash\n\nDay One is over, The Future's approaching\n\nThe embers are glowing, we're spreading the ash\n\nWe're flipping the script, spinning this shit\n\nYou've been evicted, six-six and a kick\n\nYou're finished, that's it, a swing and a miss\n\nYou're dead in the wind 'cause your wings have been clipped\n\nWe're giving it lift, you're wishing you did\n\nYou're stuck in the middle and sinking again\n\nYou are the end, we are where it begins\n\n\n\nWe are the future, we are the future\n\nWe're the future and we have just begun\n\nWe are the truth, the chosen ones\n\nWe are the new, the past is gone\n\nWe are the future and we have just begun\n\n\n\nTime has come, ready or not, it's waiting for no one\n\nTime has come, ready or not, we are the chosen\n\nTime has come, ready or not, it's waiting for no one\n\nTime has come, ready or not\n\n\n\nWe are the future, we are the future\n\nWe're the future and we have just begun\n\nWe are the truth, the chosen ones\n\nWe are the new, the past is gone\n\nWe are the future and we have just begun\n\nWe are the future"
