Where did it go?\r\nBack when we were the kings and queens down on every road\r\nGlory days crazy\r\nNo way to know\r\nRunnin' 90 miles an hour straight into our last tomorrow\n\n\n\nWe vanished into thin air\n\nSo fast we didn't know what went wrong\n\nJust disappeared like the dance halls\n\nWoke up one mornin' and we were gone\n\nThose border town days with you and me, baby\n\nFaded into folklore\n\nI can't run back to you\n\nOh, nobody goes to Acuna anymore\n\n\n\nHey, whatever happened\n\nTo ole Sanger Hall\n\nThat was our go to man if the ghosts in the walls could talk\n\nI still laugh when I think about\n\nYou workin' that Corona Club Bar\n\nShootin' out the lights while I was dodgin' fights\n\nYeah, now those were the nights\n\nBut that was back before we\n\n\n\nVanished into thin air\n\nSo fast we didn't know what went wrong\n\nJust disappeared like the dance halls\n\nWoke up one mornin' and we were gone\n\nThose border town days with you and me, baby\n\nFaded into folklore\n\nI can't run back to you\n\nAnd nobody goes to Acuna anymore\n\n\n\nAh, the world's still turnin'\n\nThat river's still runnin'\n\nBut there ain't no goin' back\n\n\n\nWe vanished into thin air\n\nSo fast we didn't know what went wrong\n\nDisappeared like the dance halls\n\nWoke up one mornin' and we were just gone\n\nThose border town days with you and me, baby\n\nHell, that's just old folklore\n\nYeah, I can't run back to you\n\nNo, I can't run back to you\n\nYeah, nobody goes to Acuna anymore"
