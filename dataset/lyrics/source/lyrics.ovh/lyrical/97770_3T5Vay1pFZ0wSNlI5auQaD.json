  "lyrics": "Was I just dreaming?\r\nWere my eyes playing tricks on me?\r\nWas I really seeing?\r\nSuch a belle at 25 Wexford Street\r\nI ain't gonna lie, don't recall her name\r\nBut the Dublin lights saw everything\n\nNow the legend lives all across that town\n\nAn American boy and an Irish gal\n\n\n\nThat night, all night\n\nWe were dancing straight to sheets\n\nYeah, she was mine, all mine\n\nLost in the beauty of the beat\n\nLet the sound of the pound bump in our chests\n\n'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest\n\nShe left and the only thing left of her\n\nIs one night, and my, what a beautiful blur\n\n\n\nBlack hair, blue eyes, tattoos dark as night\n\nAnd her necklace just said \"dreamer\" on a key\n\nI ain't gonna lie, I recall her curse\n\nAnd the jet black ink of a Bible verse\n\nThe things we did, never thought I would\n\nBut the 23rd psalm never looked so good\n\n\n\nThat night, all night\n\nWe were dancing straight to sheets\n\nYeah, she was mine, all mine\n\nLost in the beauty of the beat\n\nLet the sound of the pound bump in our chests\n\n'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest\n\nShe left and the only thing left of her\n\nIs one night, and my, what a beautiful blur\n\n\n\n\n\nKinda fitting her necklace said \"dreams\"\n\nThat's the only time I see her\n\n\n\nYeah, that night, all night\n\nWe were dancing straight to sheets\n\nYeah, she was mine, all mine\n\nLost in the beauty of the beat\n\nYeah, that night, all night\n\nWe were dancing straight to sheets\n\nYeah, she was mine, all mine\n\nLost in the beauty of the beat\n\nLet the sound of the pound bump in our chests\n\n'Til the sunrise laid our lust to rest\n\nShe left and the only thing left of her\n\nIs one night, and my, what a beautiful blur\n\nWhat a beautiful blur\n\nWhat a beautiful blur"
