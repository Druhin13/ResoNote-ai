  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Comfortable par Alessia Cara\r\nWhat happens to a flame when it burns out?\nWhat happens to a love that's not new?\nWhat happens when I'm no longer impressive?\nOr when there's nothing left to learn about you?\n\nSee I used to wonder about you\nWhat it would be like to love you\nNow I've seen every hole in your heart\nI'm used to loving slowly\nBut this time you already know me\nI hope you like all the broken parts\n\nOh, we can't run away from the comfortable\n'Cause it's inevitable in love, in love\nOh it's time we make way for the comfortable\n'Cause it's already comfortable in us, in us\n\n\nSave the honeymoon\nIt's just a puppet show (Puppet show)\nThey say nobody really makes it through (Makes it through)\nAnd though a part of me wishes that this was two July's ago\nThe rest of me is safer here with you\n\nSee, I used to wonder about you\nWhat it would be like to love you\nBut now I know you inside and out\nI'm used to loving slowly\nBut it took you nothing to know me\nWhat happens when I run out of parts? Yeah\n\nOh, I guess you could say that it's comfortable\nAnd it's inevitable in love, in love\n\nOh, it's time we make way for the comfortable\n'Cause it's already comfortable in us, in us\n\nIt turns out you think my favorite song's annoying\nTurns out no one makes me sensitive like you\nI used to be sad that the honeymoon's behind us\nUntil I realized that it means we made it through\n\nOh, we can't run away from the comfortable\n'Cause it's inevitable in love (In love), in love (In love)\nOh, it's time we make way for the comfortable (For the comfortable)\n'Cause it's already comfortable (It's already comfortable) in us, in us\n\nYeah\n\nI'm so comfortable\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nIn the comfortable with you"
