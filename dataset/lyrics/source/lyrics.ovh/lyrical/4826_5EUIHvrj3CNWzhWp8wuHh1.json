  "lyrics": "I have seen a sunset in the western sky\r\nAin't nothin' like the brightness in your eyes\r\nAnd I have seen the moon reflecting in the sea\r\nBut that don't compare to how you shine on me\r\nAfter everything I've seen, I rather see you smile\n\nCause all I really want is just to hold you for a while and be your man\n\n\n\nSo will you dance with me?\n\nI will lead you\n\nGive every moment that I have\n\nJust to be near you\n\n& when the song ends and everyone else leaves\n\nWill you dance one more with me?\n\n\n\nWhen my hands are heavy and your words are slow\n\nKiss my lips and tell me you won't let me go\n\nAnd with every single heart beat I have left\n\nI'll make it known you are my world and nothing less\n\n\n\nCause all I really want is just to hold you for a while and be your man\n\n\n\nSo will you dance with me?\n\nI will lead you\n\nGive every moment that I have\n\nJust to be near you\n\n& when the song ends and everyone else leaves\n\nWill you dance one more with me?\n\nWill you dance one more with me?"
