  "lyrics": "Smash my heart in pieces, it looks so good on the floor\r\nDays slip into years of wounds that bleed fresh\r\nSuffer in silence, is what you do best\r\nYou have no guidance, no person to tell\r\nYou're bleedin' on the inside but ain't nobody here can tell\n\nYour smile is a mask, you wear it so well\n\nThe darkness you carry has given you hell\n\nI know it gets scary but you will be fine\n\nYou won't have to deal with the voice in your mind\n\n\n\nLook up kid\n\nI see your face, you are going through something\n\nLook up kid\n\nIt gets better but you won't even know it\n\nLook up kid\n\nI see your face, you are going through something\n\nLook up kid\n\n\n\nDon't forget the darkness always turns to light\n\nYou will have to fight for the sanity you find\n\nGo and find a corner, a place where you can pray\n\nAnd hope to God you'll make it, with every second that you make\n\nDestiny's callin' and I call your bluff\n\nTell me you're tryin', you can't give up\n\nMoments that count 'cause in the end\n\nYou'll say you made it, you'll say that you'll win\n\n\n\nLook up kid\n\nI see your face, you are going through something\n\nLook up kid\n\nIt gets better but you won't even know it\n\nLook up kid\n\nI see your face, you are going through something\n\nLook up kid\n\n\n\nDon't hit the ground, don't turn around\n\nI won't come back 'til you're safe and you're sound\n\nHelp you calm down, make you come 'round\n\nI'll never leave you, I promise I'm down\n\nIf I'm out of town, if I'm out of bound\n\nI will come get you sooner than now\n\nI'm beggin' you now, I'm beggin' you now\n\n(I'm beggin', I'm beggin', I'm beggin' you now)\n\n\n\nLook up kid\n\nI see your face, you are going through something\n\nLook up kid\n\nIt gets better but you won't even know it\n\nLook up kid\n\nI see your face, you are going through something\n\nLook up kid"
