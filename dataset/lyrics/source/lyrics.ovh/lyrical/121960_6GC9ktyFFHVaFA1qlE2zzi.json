  "lyrics": "This is hell\r\nAshes of a fantasy\r\nWe were chasing down a dream\r\nBut now I'm waving a white flag\r\nSo, will you let it rest in peace\r\nLet it be\n\nJust a fading melody in your head\n\nCause I am waving a white flag\n\n\n\nI am better without you\n\nWithout you\n\n\n\nSo, I'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nGetting rid of every part of you\n\nWe are standing in a burning field of clover\n\nI'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nLet it wither into déjà vu\n\nI'll be hiding in the storm until it's over\n\nWithout you\n\n\n\nThis is hell\n\nProduct of your apathy\n\nLosing sight of what is real\n\nBut now I'm waving a white flag\n\nSo, will you let it rest it peace\n\nLet it be\n\nJust a fading memory in your head\n\nCause I am waving a white flag\n\n\n\nSo, I'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nGetting rid of every part of you\n\nWe are standing in a burning field of clover\n\nI'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nLet it wither into déjà vu\n\nI'll be hiding in the storm until it's over\n\nWithout you\n\n\n\nWhen it's over, it is over\n\nPut a rest to it, put a rest to it\n\nWhen it's over, it is over\n\nPut a rest to it, put a rest to it\n\nWhen it's over, it is over\n\nPut a rest to it, put a rest to it\n\nWhen it's over, it is over\n\nIt is over\n\n\n\nSo, I'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nGetting rid of every part of you\n\nWe are standing in a burning field of clover\n\n(Without you)\n\n(Without you)\n\nSo, I'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nGetting rid of every part of you\n\nWe are standing in a burning field of clover\n\nI'm breaking up my heart in two\n\nLet it wither into déjà vu\n\nI'll be hiding in the storm until it's over\n\nWithout you"
