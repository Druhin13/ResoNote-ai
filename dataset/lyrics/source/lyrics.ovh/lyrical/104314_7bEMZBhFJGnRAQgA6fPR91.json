  "lyrics": "Say, this is the realist shit I ever wrote or said\r\nWake up with it everyday and take it with me to bed\r\nHurting my heart and hanging over my head\r\nBout the realest nigga these Texas streets ever bred\r\nC.L. Butler better known as Chad or Pimp C\r\nThe closest homeboy that I ever had\n\nNow when we first met, we wasn't on the same page\n\nFrom pettiness understandings that got cleared up with age\n\nTwo young boys who was ready to mash\n\nPut P.A. on the map and maybe make a little cash\n\nJumped down with Big Tyme, put down a few songs\n\nEverybody co-signed saying that we could do no wrong\n\nThen hit the streets with a big ass bang\n\nThem gangsta ass rhymes with that country ass twang\n\nDropped \"Tell Me Something Good\" took off and went live\n\nShit, next thing you know we was signing to Jive\n\nDropped \"Too Hard to Swallow\" \"A Pocket Full of Stones\"\n\nPut the remix on \"Menace\" shit we had it going on\n\nGot love in the streets and played on the air\n\nBut the homey putting us out, wasn't playing too fair\n\nHad to separate ourself, bring in a new team\n\nBut sometimes the other side ain't always what it seems\n\nWe dropped \"Super Tight\" a album full of killer flows\n\nBut then we got caught up with the drugs and the hoes\n\nWe didn't realize what was happening on the real\n\nAnd new management was cutting back room deals\n\nHiding different money and ever sealing the price\n\nHe had us doing all the work but was keeping the biggest slice\n\nTook a while to catch on, to what homey was doing\n\nBut by the time we did, all the paperwork was in ruins\n\nNigga kept all the receipts so we couldn't file taxes\n\nThe next thing you know, IRS hitting us with axes\n\nPimp you owe seven figures, Bun you owe six\n\nBetter get your paper together, get this shit fixed\n\nRemixed the management team and tried it ourself\n\nCussed out the GM, almost got put on the shelf\n\nFuck it, dropped \"Ridin' Dirty\" instant classic in the South\n\nReclaimed the southern title, shut everybody's mouth\n\nGot some clout in the game, boys calling us the greatest\n\nBut meanwhile me and Pimp is still ducking haters\n\nThe old manager calling and say he fina' sue\n\nAnd put a padlock on the everything we trying to do\n\nPut a call out to the Prince, this nigga still hating\n\nWe got heat for the streets, and we can't keep the people waiting\n\nHe made a call to ??? and folks, telling the man\n\nYou gotta cut UGK some slack understand\n\nYoung Pimp got the plan, Bun got the drawl\n\nRap-A-Lot had our back and we just waiting on Jive\n\nWe got the big bosses on the same page\n\nSo me and young Pimp went hit 'em from center stage\n\nNext thing you know we got this call from the N.Y.\n\nIt's Jay-Z saying y'all niggaz getting fly\n\nHe doing \"Volume 3\" and got a track from Timb\n\nAnd wondered could some trill niggaz rock it with him\n\nShit big Bun was all for it, but Pimp wasn't sure\n\nBut \"Big Pimpin\" hit 'em 187-Pure\n\nNumber one song on every station you turn on\n\nMTV and BET we getting our burn on\n\nGrammy nominated can't believe that we made it\n\nAnd we got a call from Jive that left us all faded\n\nAnd it stated, that due to the success of the track\n\nWe here at Jive records, would like to piggy back\n\nGet another beat from Timb, then get a verse from Jay\n\nLet Hype shoot the video and we'll be on the way\n\nShit it sounded okay, but me I had to ask\n\nIf we don't do Big Pimpin 2, would you still put us on blast\n\nA song like that would might take a nigga to the top\n\nBut my true fan base, might think a nigga flop\n\nThey got mad and put niggaz on hold\n\nFor damn near a year till the buzz got cold\n\nSo we said fuck 'em and went back to the basics\n\nTrying to find ways to get the fuck up out the matrix\n\nWe put \"Dirty Money\" together and it was aces\n\nBut that's around the time that Pimp caught two cases\n\nHe got probation, said fuck you hoes\n\nWe finish the album, got ready to do a couple shows\n\nAnd then he violated, one month before we dropped\n\nAnd shit just got put on hold or fucking stopped\n\nNow 30 days done, we back to the nitty gritty\n\nAlbum got released, big showdown in Chocolate City\n\nNiggaz with masks on, vests and all black\n\nIt's Christmas 2001, bitch we was all that\n\nStrongest on the block, nobody could budge\n\nAnd then he violated, now we right back before the judge\n\nThey calling him a nuisance, put my dog behind a fence\n\nIt was January 28th, he ain't been home since\n\nThrew a nigga through a loop and caught me in the crosses\n\nStanding cold, CEO, now I'm the fucking boss\n\nHad the devil on my back, got to drinking and drugging\n\nHad to make a choice, get back to rapping or thugging\n\nSo I walked into my bedroom, got down on my knees\n\nPut my hands together and I prayed Lord please\n\nLet me get past this bridge over water that's trouble\n\nAnd get back up on my grind on the double\n\nHe said son don't worry\n\nCause it's not really hard as it seem\n\nAnd I can turn your nightmares back into dreams\n\nYou just got to stay true to yourself and succeed\n\nThen push away from the devil and get closer to me\n\nAnd every since that night man I promise I been on it\n\nGiving that killer flow to anybody who want it\n\nPimp the pen like never before, I'm breaking 'em G\n\nNot to mention I got the world screaming free Pimp C\n\nSo soon as you make parole and they open the doors\n\nYou ain't gotta worry about nothing, the world is yours\n\nAin't no mo' struggles my nigga and no mo' stripe\n\nI kept it real because to me it's UGK for life"
