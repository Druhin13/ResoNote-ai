  "lyrics": "You have to fix the mind before you can bestow the blessing\r\nBecause until they get their mind right\r\nEverything you invest in them is going to leak out\r\nOf the crevices of a mind that refuses to change\r\nLook at your neighbor and ask them\r\n\"Do you have a mind to change?\"\n\nWait for an answer\n\nIf they said no, drag them to the altar\n\nTell them they've got till midnight to get that fixed\n\nThey've got till midnight to dump out all jealousy\n\nAll pettiness, all unforgiveness, all strife, all malice, all confusion\n\nAll blaming other people for your mistakes\n\nYou've got till midnight to get rid of every poison\n\nThat's hindering you, every inflexibility that's stopping you\n\nFrom what God is about to pour into your life\n\nWar be onto you if you're going into another year and\n\nWaste another year with the old mentality\n\nWhile somebody's in the hospital begging God\n\nFor the opportunity that you have right now\n\nYou better step into this moment\n\n\n\nPut your hand on your head and say, \"Give me a new mind\"\n\nGive me new mind means give me a new perspective\n\nGive me a new perspective\n\nGive me a new way of looking at my situation\n\nGive me a new way of looking at my circumstances\n\nGet my mind ready for this year\n\nBecause when I get this year there's gonna be blessings\n\nThere's gonna be miracles, there's gonna to be opportunities\n\nOh, yes, it's gonna be some struggles\n\nIt's gonna be some challenges\n\nIt's gonna be some tests\n\nBut even the struggles are an opportunity for me to show off\n\nThe victory if my mind can handle the change\n\n\n\n?Do you have the mindset to be blessed?\n\nYou have to decide to be blessed\n\nYou have to decide, \"You know what, this is a day\n\nThat the Lord have made, I will rejoice\n\nAnd be glad that I will rejoice\"\n\nLet the past go and step on into the future\n\nEverything that's inflexible and everything that's not ready \n\nEverything that's backwards and everything that's negative and \n\nEverything that's condescending and everything that's carnal and \n\nEverything that's holding me back\n\nI refuse to take it over into another year and waste another\n\nNew year with an old mind where the devil is alive\n\n\n\nI will rejoice\n\nI will rejoice\n\n\n\nWoah, Dorothy, I wanna tell you\n\nYou could've been home a long time ago\n\nAs soon as you decide to stop looking for answers in other \n\nPeople and miracles somewhere down the yellow brick road\n\nAnd click the heels of your mind and set your affections\n\nOn things that are more\n\nYou could have been free years ago\n\n\n\nI will rejoice\n\nI will rejoice\n\nI will rejoice\n\n\n\nLook at your innocence, you don't have to get out of trouble\n\nTell them you don't have to get out of trouble before midnight\n\nYou just have to get your mind out of trouble\n\nIf you can get your mind out, you can get your money out\n\nYou get your family out, you can get your job out\n\nYou get your carrier out, you can get health out\n\nYou can get your prosperity out, if you can get your mind out\n\nNo devil in the hell, no weapon formed against you\n\nNo enemy that hates you, no witch that hexes you\n\nCan stop you from being free if you can get your mind out\n\nGrab yourself by the head and say, \"We're coming out of there\"\n\n\n\nI will rejoice\n\nI will rejoice\n\nI will rejoice"
