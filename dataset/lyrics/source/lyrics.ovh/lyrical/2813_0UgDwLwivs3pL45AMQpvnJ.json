  "lyrics": "Oh dear what the fuck have we here?\nThese motherfuckers all thorn no rose\nEgads what a bad dream better not sleep\nTake a No-Doz, do some blow\nOh shit what the hell have we done?\nIt's alive and it's hungry as fuck\n\nBetter hide all the snacks and the dough\n\nIt is out of my control, you are shit out of luck\n\nI don't wanna be unfair but the pair we got beat that weak shit you got (true god)\n\nBlew up the spot with that new bop\n\nCrew drops, do up ya squad without nuance\n\nI don't wanna sound unkind but the sounds \n\nI make are the sounds of the hounds that are howlin'\n\nUnder your bed I'm here growling\n\nSame time under the blanket you're cowering\n\n\n\nCowering like cowards cowering on concrete showers in Rikers Island\n\nVictims, we the wolves that's whylin'\n\nWe often smile at sights of violence\n\nActing brave and courageous ain't advantageous for health and safety\n\nSo when we say run the jewels just run' em baby, please don't delay me\n\nAnd that goes for a guy or lady, the fam god damn we fuckin' crazy\n\nI'll pull this pistol, put it on your poodle or your fuckin' baby\n\nShe clutched the pearls, said \"What in the world!\" and \"I won't give up shit!\"\n\nI put the pistol on that poodle and I shot that bitch\n\n\n\nRun the jewels\n\n\n\nAnd the crowd chants \"Get that paper!\"\n\nAnd the mob says \"Kill that witch!\"\n\nThis city get mad to the max better wave bye-de bye to the high scrapes kids\n\nGet a tin foil hat for the rain, in\n\nHot water from the roof to the basement\n\nI'mma smoke 'til the planet erases\n\nBuild a white flag out of Zig Zags, wave it\n\n\n\nOften I'm smoking coffin\n\nSip lean on a bean like Boston\n\nMy young bitch here fine like Pam Grier when she made that movie Coffy\n\nBut when my wife's in town, ay Jackie Brown just stay up off me\n\nCause if they don't somebody get shot and they gon' buy a coffin\n\n\n\nWith the pull of a pin a grenade get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options\n\nI'm a fool for the win I been made to be loud while these other cats drowning in softness\n\nIn a urn or the dirt get tossed in\n\nWith a grin or a smirk get accosted\n\nI'm a sin on the verse like a kid in a hearse or a nun in a cum shot (stop it)\n\n\n\nBig beast in a cage with a heart full of rage, it seems I can't behave\n\nYou could try till you die, oh well you failed, it seems the world can't be saved\n\nThese streets is full with the wolves that starve for the week so they after the weak\n\nIn a land full of lambs I am and I'll be damned if I don't show my teeth\n\n\n\nRun the jewels"
