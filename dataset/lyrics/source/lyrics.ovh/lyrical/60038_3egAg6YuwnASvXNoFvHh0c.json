  "lyrics": "المجد للشيطان معبود الرياح\r\nHail to Satan, Lord of the wind!\r\nOn the pulpit the false messiah speaks\r\nHand them your papers now cease and desist\r\nSpreading false news and selling such lies\n\n'Twas the night the lie rose and truth finally died\n\nOur slavery ends only when we are deceased\n\nOur lives are their meat, all partake in the feast\n\nThey put us to sleep with a lie and a kiss\n\nAnd when the keys lock our chains\n\nWe say: We do not resist!\n\nPoverty – rise! Children die while we read the news of gossipmongers\n\nOur lives pieces in a game\n\nThe naked emperor walks, to his new clothes we clap our hands\n\nBlinded by fortune and fame\n\nThey play the saints in our daily lives\n\nAnd we do not care at all\n\nAnd our children march to the sound of their drums\n\nWhile to war we lose our fathers and sons\n\nThe only prophet they trust in is the profit from their guns\n\nThey care not for the old the weak or the sick\n\nMasters of speeches and measuring their dicks\n\nBreaking our bones with maces not sticks\n\nAnd when their poison reaches our brains\n\nWe say: We do not resist!\n\nPoverty – rise! Children die while we read the news of gossipmongers\n\nOur lives pieces in a game\n\nThe naked emperor walks, to his new clothes we clap our hands\n\nBlinded by fortune and fame"
