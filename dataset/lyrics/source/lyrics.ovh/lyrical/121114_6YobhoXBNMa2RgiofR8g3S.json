  "lyrics": "Ooh-ooh, aw\r\nI walk the line, black leather, silver chains\r\nI'm blinded by the fame every time I hit the stage\r\nHead bangs, beer sprays, stage dives, hand waves\r\n'Til the lights blow out, and when they go out I'll be\n\n\n\nIn a glass box, suffocating from the fame and fortune\n\nIn a glass box, yeah it's quiet, with everlasting motion\n\nAnd I can't breathe and I can't see and I can't be myself\n\nAnd even in the spotlight you can't see that I need help\n\n\n\nSo many hands, everywhere I go\n\nTryna pull me into their frigid killin' snow\n\nTheir hearts are cold, my touch aflame, now tell a lie to get higher\n\nThey all want a piece of my fire\n\n\n\nThe glass box can't be broken, clearness cannot be tempted\n\nNo oxygen inside, so I don't know how I'm livin'\n\n\n\nIn a glass box, suffocating from the fame and fortune\n\nIn a glass box, yeah it's quiet, with everlasting motion\n\nAnd I can't breathe and I can't see and I can't be myself\n\nAnd even in the spotlight you can't see that I need help\n\n\n\nIn a glass box, suffocating, from the fame and fortune\n\nIn a glass box, yeah it's quiet, with everlasting motion\n\nWith everlasting motion\n\n\n\nThe glass box can't be broken, clearness cannot be tempted\n\nNo oxygen inside, so I don't know how I'm livin'\n\n\n\nIn a glass box, suffocating, from the fame and fortune\n\nIn a glass box, yeah it's quiet, with everlasting motion\n\nAnd I can't breathe and I can't see and I can't be myself\n\nAnd even in the spotlight you can't see that I need help"
