  "lyrics": "I've gone out too far\r\nMay not make it back\r\nHow can I get through\r\nIf you cringe at the sight\r\nAnd if I had something you wanted\r\nYou would stay\n\nThat's just the horrifying way I see it\n\n\n\nShame\n\nScreaming like a whale from the love I've failed\n\nDreaming of a way but you know my hands are tied\n\nFalling to the floor in a restless state\n\nPicking at my skin cause you know I can't be saved\n\n\n\nI may lose myself\n\nSo you will be fine\n\nAnd if I had something you wanted\n\nYou would stay\n\nThat's just the horrifying way I see it\n\n\n\nIf you really mean it\n\nIf you really mean it\n\nYou never have to go\n\nThat's all I want\n\n\n\nBurning like a candle at both its ends\n\nShining really bright but the warmth won't last the night\n\nFalling to the floor in a restless state\n\nPicking at my skin cause you know I can't be saved\n\n\n\nYou say you wanted more\n\nI know you wanted more\n\nDoesn't mean a thing\n\nMean a thing to me\n\nYou said that you would change\n\nEverything's the same\n\nIt takes too much for me\n\nIt takes everything\n\n\n\nShame\n\nScreaming like a whale from the love I've failed\n\nDreaming of a way but you know my hands are tied\n\nBurning like a candle at both its ends\n\nShining really bright but the warmth won't last the night"
