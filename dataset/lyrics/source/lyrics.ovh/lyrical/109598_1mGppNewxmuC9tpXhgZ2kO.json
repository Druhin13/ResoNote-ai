  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ocean par dontask\r\nPlease keep me afloat\nOne more time\nWater draws me down\nI'm waiting for the sunrise\n\nHow could I have known\nLost in time\nDarkness numbs my senses\nAnd I used to call it mine\nI fell in love with the night\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\nWaiting for the sun\nTired eyes\nHope is my protection\nKeeping me alive\n\nWater's still not gone\nI'm still blind\nFeels like I am someone living someone elses life\nI fell in love with the lie\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\n\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\nI'm not afraid of the ocean\nVoices used to scare me all the time\nIf I want leave, then let me go\nIf I know it works, then let me show\nBut I'll never find out\nI will never find out\nFar from the ocean \n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\n\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\nI would rather drown than never make a change\n\nThe ocean can wash me away\nIf I run ashore save and sound one day\nI can't imagine any better place\nI would rather drown than never make a change"
