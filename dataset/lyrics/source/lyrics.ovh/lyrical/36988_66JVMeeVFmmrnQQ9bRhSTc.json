  "lyrics": "I thought I saw you on the train\r\nBut the houses kept getting in the way\r\nI thought It might be you\r\nI thought I saw you at my wits end\r\nSharing a cigarette with a friend\r\nIt might have not been you\n\n\n\nDon't lead me back to where I came from\n\nDon't lead me back to where I came from\n\n\n\nI know you saw me at my best\n\nPuffing out my chest\n\nI know you were impressed, it had to be you\n\nYou took me by surprise at the end\n\nJust turn back and start again\n\nIt was too late for amends\n\n\n\nYeah it starts in my head\n\nIt arrives above my bed\n\nYeah the stars are turning green\n\nI don't mind just what I see\n\nIs it the girl that you see\n\nYou're my little dream\n\nIs that the girl that you see\n\nShe's become a part of me\n\n\n\nDon't lead me back to where I came from\n\nDon't lead me back to where I came from\n\nDon't lead me back to where I came from\n\nDon't lead me back to where I came from"
