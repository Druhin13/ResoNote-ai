  "lyrics": "We’ve seen the miles\r\nWe drank the moon\r\nWe choose the sides\r\nAnd judge the fools\r\nWhat’s the matter, did the silence find you?\n\nHow’s it to feel to see the one thing you don’t need?\n\nCome around come around this way\n\n\n\nI won’t defend\n\nYou won’t surrender\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nA long lost descent\n\nWe do it together\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nYou lead and we’ll follow\n\n\n\nWe’re safe and sound\n\nSpoke up way too soon\n\nWe can all just close our eyes\n\nAnd pray to god, we all pull through\n\n\n\nWhat’s the matter, did the lights just blind you?\n\nHow's it feel to see the one thing we all need?\n\nCome around come around this way\n\n\n\nI won’t defend\n\nYou won’t surrender\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nA long lost descent\n\nWe do it together\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nYou lead and we’ll follow\n\n\n\nSurrender and follow\n\nHow does it feel to change?\n\nIn the darkest of days, we all fall down\n\nOne more mistake\n\nThe changes seem to fade\n\n\n\nI won’t defend\n\nYou won’t surrender\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nA long lost descent\n\nWe do it together\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nYou lead and we will follow\n\n\n\nI won’t defend\n\nYou won’t surrender\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nA long lost descent\n\nWe do it together\n\nHow long do we go?\n\nYou lead and we’ll follow\n\n\n\nWe’ll follow"
