  "lyrics": "Well time she did as time she does\r\nShe passed along her way\r\nAnd dawn she crept like a frightened girl\r\nOut from the night time’s sway\r\nBut in the merry month of May\n\nA solemn fact does lurk\n\nFor Spring it sprang as Spring it does\n\nAnd put the bees to work\n\n\n\nAnd work they must\n\nAnd work they shall\n\nFor all the things to grow\n\nFor if they don’t as time she knows\n\nThey’d wither on the bough\n\nAnd what a shame such things would be\n\nNo wondrous wine for you and me\n\nNo cider too, nor mead nor soup\n\nFor us to all make merry\n\n\n\nSo rot, ferment and decompose\n\nSo all the things can grow\n\nOr wallow in a drinkless world\n\nAnd wither on the bough\n\n\n\nOh what a dusty burden\n\nThat nectar and that pollen\n\nLike Atlas with the heavens\n\nOn the back of his head\n\nAnd what if they should falter\n\nAnd shrug their little shoulders?\n\nWell time she’d pass all the same"
