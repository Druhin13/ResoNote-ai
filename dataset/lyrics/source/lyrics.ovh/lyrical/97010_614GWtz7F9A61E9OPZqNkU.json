  "lyrics": "You're afraid to meet someone\r\n'Cause you've been burned, you've been burned, you've been burned\r\nLove is good until it's gone\r\nThat's what you learned, what you've learned, what you've learned\r\nYou don't have to hide your love away and\n\nI know that I'm gonna make mistakes but\n\nLeaning on somebody isn't easy\n\nI'll do what I can to make you see, oh\n\n\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\nNow your heart is in my hands\n\nI won't give it up\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\n\n\nYou may not think I know the difference\n\nBut I do, but I do, but I do\n\nI feel the gravity in between us\n\nAnd you can too, you can too, you can too\n\n\n\nWe don't have to hide our love away and\n\nBoth of us are gonna make mistakes 'cause\n\nLeaning on somebody's never easy\n\nBut look at me and tell me you don't see love , oh\n\n\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\nNo, this is not a temporary love\n\nNow your heart is in my hands\n\nI won't give it up\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\n\n\nWhen the world around is caving in\n\nAnd the winds will keep on changing\n\nTake my hand and let it spin\n\nWe'll hold still\n\n\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\nNo, this is not a temporary love\n\nNow my heart is in your hands\n\nPlease don't give it up\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\n\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\nNo, this is not a temporary love\n\nNow your heart is in my hands\n\nPlease don't give it up\n\nThis is not a temporary love\n\nThis is not a temporary love"
