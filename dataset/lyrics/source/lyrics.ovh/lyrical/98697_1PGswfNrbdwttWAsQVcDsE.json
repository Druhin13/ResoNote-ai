  "lyrics": "The commander is calling home to tell the news\r\nIt isn't good, I am afraid to say\r\nToday's the day you have been dreading for so many years\r\nIts almost like you have been saving up the tears\r\nRemembering the words\r\nYou to me, are encased in nothing but beauty and gracious love\n\n\n\nYou'll always be my one good reason to keep on moving 'til I'm in your arms\n\n\n\nMy favorite place is wherever you are\n\nBut I don't know where you are\n\n\n\nNow this ugly point of view keeps creeping up to say\n\nIts all his fault you feel this way\n\nBut that won't help and its not right to think that anyway\n\nWell, god damn, why did this have to happen anyway?\n\nWhy'd you have to leave across the sea?\n\nWhere I can't reach you and hold you, protect you the way I need\n\n\n\nYou'll always be my one good reason to keep on moving 'til I'm in your arms\n\nMy favorite place is wherever you are, but I don't know where you are\n\nMy favorite place is wherever you are, but I don't know where you are\n\n\n\nI don't know where you are\n\nI don't know where you are\n\n\n\nNow this crack beneath the ocean floor, it calls it way up to me\n\nAnd when I sleep I don't know why\n\nBut it suggests I should come find it\n\nSo when I wake I don't know where I am\n\nI fumble all around into the dark\n\nAnd in an awful moment I realize I've lost you\n\n\n\nI keep thinking you're hiding somewhere only I can see\n\nBut I wake to find you nowhere and I'm tearing at my sheets\n\nI keep thinking you're hiding somewhere only I can see\n\nBut I wake to find you nowhere and I'm tearing at my sheets\n\n\n\nI don't know where you are\n\nI don't know where you are"
