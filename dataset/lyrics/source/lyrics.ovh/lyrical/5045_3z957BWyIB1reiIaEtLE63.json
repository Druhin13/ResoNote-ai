  "lyrics": "History's been leaning on me lately\r\nI can feel the future breathing down my neck\r\nAnd all the things I thought were true when I was young, and you were too\r\nTurned out to be broken, I don't know what comes next\r\nIn a world that has decided that it's going to lose its mind\n\nBe more kind, my friends, try to be more kind\n\n\n\nIt seems like everybody's raising walls now\n\nLike hackles raised upon a cornered cat\n\nOn the borders in our heads between things that can and can't be said\n\nWe stopped talking to each other and there's something wrong with that\n\n\n\nSo before you go out searching, don't decide what you'll find\n\nBe more kind, my friends, try to be more kind\n\n\n\nYou should know you're not alone\n\nTrouble comes and trouble goes\n\nHow this ends no one knows\n\nSo, hold on tight when the wind blows\n\n\n\nThe wind blew both of us to sand and sea\n\nAnd where the dry lands stands is hard to say\n\nAs the current drags us by the shore we can no longer say for sure\n\nWho's drowning, or if they can be saved\n\n\n\nBut when you're out there floundering, like a lighthouse I will shine\n\nBe more kind, my friends, try to be more kind\n\nLike a beacon reaching out to you and yours, for me and mine\n\nBe more kind, my friends, try to be more kind\n\nIn a world that has decided that it's going to lose its mind\n\nBe more kind, my friends, try to be more kind"
