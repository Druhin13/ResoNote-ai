  "lyrics": "As you walk through the shadow\r\nFeel your weight on solid ground\r\nAs you tremble in the darkness\r\nIn the midst of silent sounds\r\nAs you search for your answer\r\nAnd no answer has been found\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\n\n\nAnd when you come to the table\n\nTo lay your burdens down\n\nAs you wait upon the weary\n\nFor whom no rest was found\n\nAs you search for to lean on\n\nAnd find no friend around\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\n\n\nAnd may you stand, stand your ground\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\nWhen the last step is before you\n\nAnd you feel like falling down\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\n\n\nAnd as you kneel in the garden\n\nAnd no one is around\n\nAs you raise your hands above you\n\nAnd from your lips cry out\n\nOh Father forgive me\n\nFor I could not see through my doubt\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\n\n\nAnd may you stand, stand your ground\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\nWhen the last step is before you\n\nAnd your light is burning out\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground\n\nOh, may you stand, stand your ground yeah\n\nMay you stand, stand your ground"
