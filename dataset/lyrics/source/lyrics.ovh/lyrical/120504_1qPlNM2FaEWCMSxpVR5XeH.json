  "lyrics": "I've got the motherfucking world in my palm now, don't tell me to calm down\r\nStriking a match, igniting the track while I'm typing in caps, it's on now\r\nThe rap Casanova with cash in a sofa in the back of a Rover\r\nSix-pack in a backpack and I'm cracking 'em open; sipping, I'm trapped in a moment\r\nOpen your eyes 'cause you're never gonna know if your next move might be your last\r\nLiving a lie, everybody's always gonna bring up my past\n\nWell, I'm past that, interest up and my bag's packed\n\nI'm the NASDAQ with a bad rap so...\n\n\n\nI'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing\n\nYou're pointing the blame\n\nYou know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused\n\nAnd stay the hell out of my way\n\nSo why do you believe\n\nYou're losing your mind, losing your mind again\n\nIn everyone but me?\n\nI'm losing my mind, losing my mind again\n\n\n\nI've seen the hardships, lived in darkness through the mud into the marshes\n\nMy reputation is tarnished; but regardless, I am awesome\n\nSaw the gossip from my lockup go colossal then I blossomed to the boss of this rock stuff\n\nAnd I'm never gonna stop till the cops come\n\nWhat I'm really trying to say\n\nIs say it to my face, and if you won't, then stay the fuck out my way\n\nRocking shows, lock and load, stop me? No\n\nI'm repping the new shit, the essence of music, I'm blessed with the fusion of both\n\n\n\nI'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing\n\nYou're pointing the blame\n\nYou know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused\n\nAnd stay the hell out of my way\n\nSo why do you believe\n\nYou're losing your mind, losing your mind again\n\nIn everyone but me?\n\nI'm losing my mind, losing my mind again\n\n\n\nEver since I was a little boy I always thought that the world was going to end in my lifetime\n\nSo I tried to seize every opportunity as it came to me because I believed it might stop the sky from falling down one more day\n\nBut the older I got, the more I realized that I cannot save the world\n\nI'm not a superhero, I'm not perfect, I'm just me, a human being\n\n\n\nSo let's take, take, take the throne and break the cycle\n\nSo why do you believe everyone but me?\n\nEvery single day we kill our idols\n\nBut you won't break me down\n\nYou're losing your mind, losing your mind again\n\nYou're losing your mind, losing your mind again\n\nWe're losing our minds, losing our minds\n\n\n\nI'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing\n\nYou're pointing the blame\n\nYou know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused\n\nAnd stay the hell out of my way\n\nSo why do you believe\n\nYou're losing your mind, losing your mind again\n\nIn everyone but me?\n\nI'm losing my mind, losing my mind again\n\n\n\nI'm not ready to change, I'm doing my thing\n\nYou're losing your mind, losing your mind again\n\nYou know I'm not ready to choose, so don't get confused\n\nI'm losing my mind, losing my mind again"
