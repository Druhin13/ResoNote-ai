It came without a warning\r\nAnd in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life\r\nYou and me get too real but all I feel is alright\r\nMy heart's a secret, mmm\n\nI think I'm coming alive, yeah\n\nI think I'm coming alive with you\n\nTell me you'll keep it, mmm\n\nI think I'm coming alive, yeah\n\nI come alive with you\n\n\n\nDon't give it up, don't say it hurts\n\n'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby\n\nNow that I found you\n\nI want it all\n\nNo, there's nothing like this feeling, baby\n\nNow that I found you\n\nNow that I found you\n\nNow that I found you\n\n\n\nGive me the words I want, baby, just say it\n\nYou know me way too well to keep it complicated\n\nI don't wanna hide my love\n\nI don't wanna waste it (I don't wanna waste it)\n\nBut I can't deny the moment when I taste it\n\n\n\nMy heart's a secret, mmm\n\nI think I'm coming alive, yeah\n\nI think I'm coming alive with you\n\nTell me you'll keep it, mmm\n\nI think I'm coming alive, yeah\n\nI come alive with you\n\n\n\nDon't give it up (Don't give it up)\n\nDon't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)\n\n'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby\n\nNow that I found you\n\nI want it all (I want it all)\n\nNo, there's nothing like this feeling, baby\n\nNow that I found you\n\nNow that I found you\n\nNow that I found you\n\n\n\nThought it was impossible\n\nIt's just like a miracle\n\nSay nothing's impossible now\n\nNow that I found, now that I found you\n\nNow that I found, now that I found you\n\n\n\nDon't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)\n\n'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby\n\nNow that I found you\n\nI want it all (I want it all)\n\nNo, there's nothing like this feeling, baby\n\nNow that I found you (Oh)\n\nNow that I found you\n\nNow that I found you (Oh)\n\nNow that I found you\n\nNow that I found you"
