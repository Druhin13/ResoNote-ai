  "lyrics": "I don't know what's living in my body\r\n'Cause I don't recognize a thing about it\r\nThat don't even matter, I'm just glad I got into the party\r\nSo I can feel your music in my body\r\n'Cause you the only out of everybody\r\nWho can deal with all my ways\n\nI know I got some ways\n\nBut you control the flames\n\nSo I just wanna stay right here with you\n\n\n\nIt could be a room full of people, you still on my side\n\nLook at how the whole world is searching, but I got mine\n\nIt's emotional, uncontrollable, all I think about is you\n\nSo if the tears wanna flood in my gates, let the water flow\n\nJust let it fall out from my face\n\n'Cause I never thought I'd ever hear me say\n\nI just can't breathe without my baby\n\nOoh, you my baby\n\n\n\nSo come and kiss up on me\n\nAs we dance close\n\nCome and kiss up on me slow\n\nAs we dance close\n\n\n\nI don't even care, I'm nosey\n\nJust keep me there, keep me in the moment\n\nSeen a lot of things, but I never seen my spirit glowing\n\nThe way you do me got me outta body\n\n'Cause you the only out of everybody\n\nWho gon' go out of the way to show me all the ways\n\nCan't control the flame\n\nI just wanna stay right here with you\n\n\n\nIt could be a room full of people, you still on my side\n\nLook at how the whole world is searching, but I got mine\n\nIt's emotional, uncontrollable, all I think about is you\n\nSo if the tears wanna flood in my gates, let the water flow\n\nJust let it fall out, out from my face\n\nI never thought I'd ever hear me say\n\nI just can't breathe without my baby\n\nOoh, come here, baby\n\n\n\nSo you can kiss up on me\n\nAs we dance close\n\nCome and kiss up on me slow\n\nAs we dance close\n\nSo you can kiss up on me\n\nAs we dance close\n\nCome and kiss up on me slow\n\nAs we dance\n\n\n\nJust let it fall out, out of my face\n\nI never thought I'd ever hear me say\n\nI just can't breathe without my baby\n\nOoh, come here, bab\n\n\n\nSo you can kiss up on me\n\nAs we dance close\n\nCome and kiss up on me slow\n\nAs we dance close\n\nAs we dance close\n\nCome and kiss up on me slow\n\nAs we dance close\n\n\n\nI, inner, I bring to you through words I sing. My flaws, my dreams, and all from within. I am Ella Mai"
