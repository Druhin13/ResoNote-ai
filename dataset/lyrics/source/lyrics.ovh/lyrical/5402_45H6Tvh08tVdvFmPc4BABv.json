  "lyrics": "Wildflowers don't grow in the city\r\nMy heart turns gray and shriveled now\r\nI want to be who I wasn't\r\nI want to dance and not feel the gloom\r\nA child running for nothin'\r\nI watched you go, my feet were glued\n\nI found God on Sunday\n\nMore than layin' next to you\n\nMy arms stretched out like Jesus\n\nWatch you tie me down to the bed\n\nMy heaven burns on Monday\n\nNot brokenhearted but aching head\n\n\n\nWildflowers don't grow in the city\n\nI dreamt the sidewalk broke in two\n\nThe earth was calling to me\n\nA line stretched down Fifth Avenue\n\nIt came in through my window\n\nCarry me home, my cutest too"
