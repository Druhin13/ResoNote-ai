  "lyrics": "There's this world that I'm living in\r\nStranger than the one before\r\nI don't wanna fight it anymore\r\nThere's a meaning I've been looking for\r\nI never had to go too far\r\nFound you in my heart down on the floor\n\n\n\nTake me back to the start\n\nBefore all the scars affected me\n\nTake me back to the start\n\nBefore I was worried about everything\n\n\n\nTake me, take me\n\nI just wanna live in your arms\n\nWhere I'm safe forever\n\nKeep me safe forever\n\nKeep me safe forever\n\n\n\nWhat's this feeling that I'm feeling?\n\nAll different than the times before\n\nI can't even fake it anymore\n\nI was shielded by my own mistakes\n\nSo scared to give my God a break\n\nReady to let you love me now\n\n\n\nTake me back to the start\n\nBefore all the scars affected me\n\nTake me back to the start\n\nBefore I was worried about everything\n\n\n\nTake me, take me\n\nI just wanna live in your arms\n\nWhere I'm safe forever\n\nKeep me safe forever\n\nKeep me safe forever\n\n\n\nKeep me safe forever\n\nKeep me safe forever"
