  "lyrics": "You're gonna fuck me up, and I just got sober\r\nYou're my favorite drug, and my worst hangover\r\nTried to give it up, but you pulled me closer\r\nBut you pulled me closer\r\nYou're so fucked up, and you're always faded\r\nOnly hit me up when you're almost naked\n\nCan't get enough, might as well just face it\n\nMight as well just face it\n\n\n\n'Cause sometimes it feels like\n\nI'll never be alright\n\nBut I'm just fine being addicted\n\n\n\nI tried and I tried to run from it\n\nBut it's hard and it's harder to admit\n\nIn this game that we play, I never win\n\nSomethin' about you, I can't quit\n\nI tried and I tried to run from it\n\nBut it's hard and it's harder to admit\n\nIn this game that we we play, I never win\n\nSomethin' about you, I can't quit\n\n\n\nYou're gonna fuck me up, but you know I like it\n\nAlways showin' up when you're not invited\n\nBut I'm so in love, I can't even hide it\n\nI can't even hide it\n\n\n\n'Cause sometimes it feels like\n\nI'll never be alright\n\nBut I'm just fine being addicted\n\n\n\nI tried and I tried to run from it\n\nBut it's hard and it's harder to admit\n\nIn this game that we play, I never win\n\nSomethin' about you, I can't quit\n\nI tried and I tried to run from it\n\nBut it's hard and it's harder to admit\n\nIn this game that we we play, I never win\n\nSomethin' about you, I can't quit\n\n\n\nI never thought that I'd be wasting all my time\n\nI never thought that I'd be wasted all my life\n\n\n\nI tried and I tried to run from it\n\nBut it's hard and it's harder to admit\n\nIn this game that we play, I never win\n\nSomethin' about you, I can't quit\n\nI tried and I tried to run from it\n\nBut it's hard and it's harder to admit\n\nIn this game that we we play, I never win\n\nSomethin' about you, I can't quit"
