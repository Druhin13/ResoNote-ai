  "lyrics": "First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl\r\nYou always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes\r\nThere's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters\r\nYou're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life\r\nWho knows where I'd be without you?\n\nNo, I just couldn't be without you\n\nI'll just say \"Amen\"\n\nI can count 'em on one hand\n\nBut honey, look there on your finger\n\nI'd say I'm a lucky man\n\nGod made two lovers out of strangers\n\nA little house on a little land\n\nA little creek, a little Jeep\n\nSame old moon everybody sees\n\nIt sure ain't hard to count your blessings\n\n\n\nYesterday we celebrated our first year together\n\nAnd together still feels better than that first night we met\n\nI never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl\n\nHe made a perfect angel\n\nAnd he made you just for me\n\n\n\nWho knows where I'd be without you?\n\nNo, I just couldn't be without you\n\nI'll just say \"Amen\"\n\nI can count 'em on one hand\n\nBut honey, look there on your finger\n\nI'd say I'm a lucky man\n\nGod made two lovers out of strangers\n\nA little house on a little land\n\nA little creek, a little Jeep\n\nSame old moon everybody sees\n\nIt sure ain't hard to count your blessings\n\n\n\nNo, I can't count 'em on both hands\n\nBut honey, look here at this picture\n\nI'd say we're a lucky fam\n\nI'm thankful to be with you\n\nA little house on a little land\n\nCouple kids, two or three\n\nSame old song that we'll always sing\n\nIt sure ain't hard to count your blessings\n\nAlways take time to count your blessings"
