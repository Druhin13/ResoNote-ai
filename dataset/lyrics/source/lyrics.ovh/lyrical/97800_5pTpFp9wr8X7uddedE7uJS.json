  "lyrics": "You leave me open when you hit me\r\nNo one can hear me, then you hurt me\r\nJust say that you're not going down there too\r\nI can see that you want me going downhill too\r\nGoing downhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\n\n\nYou ripped me open, then you kissed me\n\nBlue lips and roses that you left me\n\nThe gag and the blind, the perfecting of the rush\n\nYeah, I walked with the fire\n\nAll the lifeblood and desire\n\nI slowly started my song with fierce\n\nI took the bludgeoned affection\n\nCome and teach me a lesson\n\nAll the things oâ€”, of a good time\n\n\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\n\n\nGoing downhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nGoing downhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby\n\nDownhill into a lullaby"
