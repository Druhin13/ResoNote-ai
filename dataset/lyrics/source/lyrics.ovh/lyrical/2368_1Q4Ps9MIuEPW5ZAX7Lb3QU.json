  "lyrics": "Chillin' at the Amoco\r\nLighting up botanical\r\nSeen a nigga I ain't like\r\nShouldda let the hammer go down to do the dirt\r\nBut I know the church his Nana go\r\nI don't want the sin on my soul 'cause I plan to go\n\nSo I keep rolling up\n\nBut he ice grilling and he swollen up\n\nBut he ain't old enough to never see another day\n\nI'm thinking this but I ain't put my gun away\n\nHe act, I'mma clap, and these people gon' run away\n\nThey gonna get my plates and the make of my vehicle\n\nI'mma be upstate full of hate tryin' see it through\n\nSo I put it in first I'mma catch 'em all alone then I'm putting work\n\n\n\nYou wanna test me? (You gotta)\n\nWait your turn B\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me\n\nI put my foot down firmly\n\nStick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me\n\n\n\nTest me? (You gotta)\n\nWait your turn B\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me\n\nI put my foot down firmly\n\nStick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me\n\n\n\nIn the club by myself getting sized up so I just rised up but I didn't need help\n\nHad a knife in the belt and a bottle that was comp\n\nI'm always ready to romp, I move kinda stealth\n\nHammer in the ride with the driver outside by the door with cocked back four\n\nHe familiar with the war and the tour keep a bullet in his jaw\n\nKnow for sure that shit can get raw when I slide\n\nThey say what up, no what up back\n\nGhost bust first, no bust back\n\nKeep that same energy, hope you remember me\n\nI'mma be that enemy that won't ever cut slack\n\n\n\nYou wanna test me? (You gotta)\n\nWait your turn B\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me\n\nI put my foot down firmly\n\nStick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me\n\n\n\nTest me? (You gotta)\n\nWait your turn B\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me\n\nI put my foot down firmly\n\nStick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me\n\n\n\nCouple a niggas don't even like Ghost\n\nStart shit up, get lit up like they a light post\n\nI ain't into arguing, I ain't into bargainin'\n\nGet a shell in a hoodie, knife in a cardigan\n\nYou see me throwing the peace sign\n\nThat two could turn to two guns up when it's creep time\n\nSlug through the peephole, now he sleep though\n\nHe the one asking for sleep time\n\nTest me, you gotta wait your turn B\n\nGet a bag full of guns and prepare for the journey\n\nGet six pallbearers, a couple attorneys\n\nYou gon' either not leave or leave in a gurney\n\nGhost\n\n\n\nYou wanna test me? (You gotta)\n\nWait your turn B\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me\n\nI put my foot down firmly\n\nStick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me\n\n\n\nTest me? (You gotta)\n\nWait your turn B\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me\n\nI put my foot down firmly\n\nStick the nose of my gun in some shit that don't concern me\n\n\n\nYou wanna test me?\n\nThere's a long line of niggas that's ready to burn me"
