  "lyrics": "If the pure didn't hate you\r\nYou know they'd have to create you\r\nYou've been forged from their fears\r\nAnother myth drowns in tears\r\nA loyal opposition\r\nAnother failed inquisition\n\nBreeds potential victims\n\nThat make fearful decisions\n\n\n\nYou keep on crawling\n\nAcross that line\n\nYou know Deathwish Man\n\nYour wish ain't mine\n\n\n\nLay judgement to waste\n\nBeneath odd numbered days\n\nDeath cannot please you\n\nIt's life that evades you\n\nA question to believe\n\nWhat you cannot deceive\n\nThe hour is upon you\n\nThere is no reprieve\n\n\n\nDeathwish Man\n\nI'm leaving you be\n\nGone is the shadow\n\nYou cast over me\n\n\n\nAnother life in the shadows\n\nDeathwish Man going blind\n\nAnother life in the shadows\n\nAnother life left behind"
