  "lyrics": "I knew a boy that was swallowed by the sky\r\nBy the flashing lights\r\nI knew a man that got lost in the big dull blue\r\nAnd came out alive\r\nI Knew a boy, I Knew the man\n\nWho looked a lot like you\n\n\n\nI Knew a time You could stand still and sigh\n\nBut the rushing by\n\nI Knew a place you can go where your head explodes Could\n\nInto peace of mind\n\n\n\nI Knew the team, I Knew the place\n\nThat felt a lot like you\n\nI Knew a boy, I Knew the man\n\nWho looked a lot like you\n\n\n\nJust like you\n\n\n\nI Knew a friend que would hold on to the flames\n\nKeep them from burning you\n\nI Knew a smile i could see through all of the stars\n\nThat the world had thrown\n\n\n\nI Knew a smile, I Knew a friend\n\nThat looked a lot like you\n\nI Knew a boy, I Knew the man\n\nWho looked a lot like you"
