  "lyrics": "You’re coming in hot\r\nBut not so bright\r\nMaking a meal of any appetite\r\nJust take it easy\r\n'Cause if I held you up against the light\n\nI could see clear enough to cut right\n\nTo where you’re weakest\n\n\n\nI can tell that\n\nYou wanna laugh it off but you’re lazy\n\nAnd I’ve been trying to make amends with you lately\n\nBut you’re difficult to reason with\n\nAnd maybe\n\nJust maybe\n\n\n\nWant my chest to keep it heavin’\n\nOn the lighter side of feelin’\n\nI’m not going into grievin’ for you\n\nFor you\n\nFor you\n\nSo I’m just gonna laugh it off\n\n\n\nI wanna be wrong\n\nBut it don’t feel right\n\nLighting my name up with an exit sign\n\nYou got me leavin’\n\n\n\nYou’re pushing me into this falling out\n\nAnd the moment that I watch my mouth\n\nI lose the feeling\n\n\n\nCause I got the good sense to laugh it off\n\nBut this is crazy\n\nYou make it seem like I’m the one\n\nWho’s being shady\n\nBut your love is in the liminal\n\nAnd maybe\n\nJust maybe\n\n\n\nWant my chest to keep it heavin’\n\nOn the lighter side of feelin’\n\nI’m not going into grievin’ for you\n\nFor you\n\nFor you\n\nFor you\n\nWant my chest to keep it heavin’\n\nOn the lighter side of feelin’\n\nI’m not going into grievin’ for you\n\nSo I’m just gonna laugh it off\n\n\n\nOh\n\nI’m just gonna laugh it off\n\nOh\n\n‘Cause the air’s got a weight right now\n\nAnd I can’t help but feel out your heavy breathing\n\nWhen I’m only teasing\n\n\n\nWant my chest to keep it heavin’\n\nOn the lighter side of feelin’\n\nI’m not going into grievin’ for you\n\nFor you\n\nFor you\n\nFor you\n\nWant my chest to keep it heavin’\n\nOn the lighter side of feelin’\n\nI’m not going into grievin’ for you\n\nSo I’m just gonna laugh it off\n\n\n\nHa ha\n\nI’m just gonna laugh it off\n\nHa ha ha"
