  "lyrics": "I tried to run and run but paranoia waits for me\r\nMy clock is counting down and time won't give it back to me\r\nThe iron fist of danger\r\nAlways smiling never sleep\r\nThe hand of doom resides inside my own worst enemy\n\nI drag you like a ball and chain\n\nIt's calling my name\n\n\n\nI'm a magnet, I attract it\n\nEverywhere I go you know trouble follows\n\nI'm just a magnet for pain\n\n\n\nThey say I'm born to lose but nothing gold has ever stayed\n\nI've nothing left to offer but this gift of misery\n\nI know that's what you wanted\n\nSuch dramatic agony\n\nThe fever breaks again\n\nI can feel it following\n\nAnd it's calling my name\n\n\n\nI'm a magnet, I attract it\n\nEverywhere I go you know trouble follows\n\nI'm just a magnet for pain"
