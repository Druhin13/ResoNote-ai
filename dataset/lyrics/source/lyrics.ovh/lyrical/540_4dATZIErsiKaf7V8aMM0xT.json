  "lyrics": "I saw her there from across the street, she was dressed in black\r\nAnd when she moved she moved to a beat, like a Cadillac\r\nShe rode a train, train train train, a train of gold\r\nShe was a woman of suspicious ways, never saw daylight\r\nAnd in her room she sat and passed the days\n\nAnd she'd creep out at night\n\nShe rode a train, train train train, a train of gold\n\n\n\nChorus: Train of gold, train of gold\n\nIt took me so long to find out I was wrong\n\nNow I wait for her in the night\n\n\n\nLooked through a window saw a velvet sky, a shade of green\n\nA violin was playing soft and sweet, like it was a dream\n\nShe rode a train, train train train, a train of gold\n\n\n\nTrain of gold, train of gold\n\nIt took me so long to find out I was wrong\n\nNow I wait for her in the night\n\n\n\nTrain of gold, train of gold\n\nI don't believe her, it just couldn't be"
