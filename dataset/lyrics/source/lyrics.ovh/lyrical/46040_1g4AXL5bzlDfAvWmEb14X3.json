  "title": "A Foggy Day",
  "lyrics": "I was a stranger in the city\r\nOut of town were the people I knew\r\nI had that feeling of self-pity\r\nWhat to do, what to do, what to do\r\nThe outlook was decidedly blue\n\nBut as I walked through the foggy streets alone\n\nIt turned out to be the luckiest day I've known\n\n\n\nA foggy day, in London town\n\nHad me low, had me down\n\nI viewed the morning, with much alarm\n\nBritish Museum, had lost its charm\n\n\n\nHow long I wondered,\n\nCould this thing last\n\nBut the age of miracles, hadn't past\n\nFor suddenly, I saw you there\n\nAnd through foggy London town,\n\nThe sun was shining everywhere\n\n\n\nFor suddenly, I saw you there\n\nAnd through foggy London town,\n\nThe sun was shining everywhere\n\n\n\nEverywhere\n\nEverywhere\n\nEverywhere"
