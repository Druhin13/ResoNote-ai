  "lyrics": "I've been lonely, missing your body\r\nYou've been out of touch, you're so far away\r\nWishing you would tell me you're sorry\r\nAnd you know you made a big mistake\r\nClose my eyes and try to forget you\n\nEvery time I do, I just see your face\n\nAfter all this shit that we've been through\n\nWhy are you so willing to walk away?\n\n\n\nI don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down\n\nI can't help it that I need you (need you)\n\nI can't help it that I need you (need you)\n\nNow I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me\n\nI'm still screaming that I need you (need you)\n\n(I can't help it that I need you)\n\n\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down\n\n\n\nYou left me with a craving I can't fill\n\nGot me wondering what I had yesterday\n\nTell everyone I'm fine, but I'm still\n\nSitting here, choking on the aftertaste\n\n\n\nCan't stay away from you, I try, I try\n\nBut you got a grip on my mind\n\n\n\nI don't know why I stick around to watch you burn our bridges down\n\nI can't help it that I need you (need you)\n\nI can't help it that I need you (need you)\n\nNow I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me\n\nI'm still screaming that I need you (need you)\n\nI can't help it that I need you\n\n\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down\n\n\n\nCan't stay away from you, I try, I try\n\nBut you got a grip on my mind\n\n\n\nNow I'm drowning underneath the water that was under me\n\nI'm still screaming that I need you (need you)\n\n(I can't help it that I need you)\n\n\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down\n\nBurn the bridges, burn them down, down, down, down, down, down"
