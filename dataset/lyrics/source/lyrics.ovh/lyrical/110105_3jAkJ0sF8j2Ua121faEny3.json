  "lyrics": "You know there's a light that glows by the front door\r\nDon't forget the keys under the mat\r\nChildhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind\r\nGo to church cause your momma says to\r\nVisit grandpa every chance that you can\r\nIt won't be a waste of time\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\n\n\nHold the door say please say thank you\n\nDon't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie\n\nI know you got mountains to climb but\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\nWhen the dreams you're dreamin' come to you\n\nWhen the work you put in is realized\n\nLet yourself feel the pride but\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\n\n\nDon't expect a free ride from no one\n\nDon't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why\n\nBitterness keeps you from flying\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\nKnow the difference between sleeping with someone\n\nAnd sleeping with someone you love\n\nI love you ain't no pick up line so\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\n\n\nHold the door say please say thank you\n\nDon't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie\n\nI know you got mountains to climb but\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\nWhen the dreams you're dreamin' come to you\n\nWhen the work you put in is realized\n\nLet yourself feel the pride but\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\n\n\nWhen it's hot, eat a root beer popsicle\n\nShut off the ac and roll the windows down\n\nLet that summer sun shine\n\nAlways stay humble and kind\n\nDon't take for granted the love this life gives you\n\nWhen you get where you're goin'\n\nDon't forget turn back around\n\nHelp the next one in line\n\nAlways stay humble and kind"
