  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lost par Lucky Rose\r\nI, oh I\nRemember the moment, tears by the ocean\nIn your eyes, your eyes\nWere telling me: Stay for just one more day\nDon't say goodbye tonight\nLet's follow this feeling, dare you to leave\nThe world behind, let time go by\n\nLet's get lost together\nYou and me lost forever young\nSearching for something better\nEverything I need is right in front of me\n\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost\n\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost together\nYou and me lost forever young\nSearching for something better\nEverything I need is right in front of me\n\nThey may say\nWe're young, dumb and dreaming, drunk on a feeling\nKids at play, I say\nWe're better off children than the tradition\nGrown up slaves in gold chains\nBiding their time for the rest of their lives\nBut youth won't fade if we stay the same\n\nLet's get lost together\nYou and me lost forever young\nSearching for something better\n\nEverything I need is right in front of me\n\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost\nLet's get lost together\nYou and me lost forever young\nSearching for something better\nEverything I need is right in front of me"
