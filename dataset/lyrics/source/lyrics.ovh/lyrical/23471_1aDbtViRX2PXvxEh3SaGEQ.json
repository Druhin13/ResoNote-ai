  "lyrics": "I found out on a Monday\r\nThe city I love doesn't love me\r\nIn fact fuck that\r\nIt would rather see me dead\r\nI hesitated for a minute\r\nBut I packed my bag that evening\n\n\n\nDidn't tell you I was leaving\n\nI didn't feel safe staying here\n\nSo I just left\n\n\n\nGot in my red Camaro\n\nIn my head no tomorrow\n\nRealized it had all been borrowed time\n\nThat I was living on til now\n\nThe sun came up less friendly\n\nMy sense of safety dead before the\n\nRed sky gave way to cold blue\n\nI wonder who I might be now\n\n\n\nFrom the wrong road, miles from no place\n\nFrom the road I call and call\n\nThis whole world is no place\n\nThis world is no place at all\n\n\n\nNo place for a creature like me\n\nSo if you're like me indeed\n\nMeet me somewhere way out\n\nOn the outer outskirts of town\n\nAt the BP diesel station\n\nIn my sick imagination\n\nYou're already on your way to take my\n\nHand and hold me up so I don't drown\n\n\n\nI just pray you get this letter\n\nI hid it in your sweater drawer\n\nSo the authorities could never see the\n\nPlan that I put down\n\nBut all the warming weather\n\nMay mean that you won't ever\n\nReach into the secret drawer, and maybe\n\nYou'd inform the landlord anyway\n\nLet me say it again, in a better way\n\n\n\nI need a pile of rubble\n\nTo call my domicile\n\nFar from the violent rabble, and could I\n\nTrouble you to come along\n\nAnd listen to me babble\n\nHow long will we babble on in exile\n\nBabble on in exile\n\nSomething tells me I may be\n\nSinging this song a long, long while\n\nBut I'll be bringing along a big broad smile\n\nTo wear as I walk that final long mile\n\nBack to the city where they broke my\n\nHeart wide open bleeding on the marble\n\nTile\n\n\n\nFrom the wrong road, miles from no place\n\nFrom the road I call and call\n\nThis whole world is no place\n\nThis world is no place at all"
