  "lyrics": "I took root on the edge and delve into the soil and dust\r\nStill hanging loose are my ends as I sleep under the Earth\r\nLife bears no meaning to me, I'm left, I'm left repeating myself\r\nTime always laughing at me still\r\nI’m left repeating myself still\n\nI’m never leaving now that I’m down here\n\nGhost of my old shape I have begun new life\n\nGiving myself away\n\n\n\nAnd I dance with the thought of connection\n\nI've found a place beyond these plastic stars\n\nWe’ll live forever in brand new posture here\n\n\n\nAs our distance expands\n\nWe are whole in the wondrous eye\n\nYou were me in my sudden death\n\nI am you in another life\n\n\n\nI have seen more than enough\n\nAll the world is rust; our teeth are gold\n\nI had been there long enough\n\nMy blood is finally running cold\n\n\n\nI took root on the edge and delve into the soil and dust\n\nStill hanging loose are my ends as I sleep under the Earth\n\nThis life bears no meaning to me, I'm left, left repeating myself\n\nTime always laughing at me still repeating\n\n\n\nI feel my blood is thinning\n\nI feel my blood is thinning\n\nI feel my blood is thinning\n\nI feel my blood is thinning\n\n\n\nCan you feel us coming through\n\nThe static blossoms into the air\n\nRise, we start to bloom\n\nBurning as we move through the world\n\nCan you feel us coming through\n\nThe static blossoms into the air\n\nRise, we start to bloom\n\nBurning\n\n\n\nI gave myself to the earth\n\nI am reborn in the ashes\n\nI gave myself to the earth\n\nReborn in the ashes"
