  "lyrics": "What's it like now? Let's just say it's hard to remember, ooh ooh\r\nEvery light's out, every store's open, I'm tender ooh ooh\r\nYou made me your prophet of stage\r\nSay you shouldn't rattle your cage\r\nOnly to realise the ? still living in the wide world\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\n\n\nWhat's it like now? I become your favourite pretender, ooh ooh\n\nKeep me tied down, keep your mind off of my temper, ooh ooh\n\nOne day then I'll laugh in your face\n\nYou picture a pastor of grace\n\nOnly to realise the future's still out in the wild\n\n\n\nI sleep in alleyways and waterfalls to find where I begin\n\nI see the future and the past\n\nI feel the present caving in\n\nI wash my hands of it and trade it for a world inside my head\n\nCan't remember what you said\n\n\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now\n\nWhat's it like now, what's it like now"
