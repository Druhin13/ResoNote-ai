  "lyrics": "I didn't mean to give my soul away\r\nTo have the life I thought that everybody wants\r\nAnd I need to let you know I was wrong\r\nIt's a sham\r\nThey stole my heart and took control away\r\nAnd when I lost the life that everybody wants\n\nWill you'd think they'd help you out\n\nBut they don't give a damn\n\n\n\nThey lift you up\n\n(You might feel it, but don't believe it)\n\nYou take your turn\n\n(You'll see it, when you achieve it)\n\nThey light that spark\n\n(You can't fight it)\n\nThen sit back and watch you burn\n\n\n\nThey lift you up\n\n(You might feel it, but don't believe it)\n\nGive you your task\n\n(You'll see it, when you achieve it)\n\nWhen your world goes dark\n\n(You can't hide it)\n\nThey'll just smile and watch you burn\n\n\n\nYou can't believe a single word they say\n\nYou tried to have the life that everybody wants\n\nPretty soon you'll figure out that you don't\n\nIt's a scam\n\nYou're torn apart, and then you're thrown away\n\nAnd you become the one that everybody talks\n\nBy then there's no way out\n\nIt's all part of the plan\n\n\n\nThey lift you up\n\n(You might feel it, but don't believe it)\n\nYou take your turn\n\n(You'll see it, when you achieve it)\n\nThey light that spark\n\n(You can't fight it)\n\nThen sit back and watch you burn\n\n\n\nThey lift you up\n\n(You might feel it, but don't believe it)\n\nGive you your task\n\n(You'll see it, when you achieve it)\n\nWhen your world goes dark\n\n(You can't hide it)\n\nThey'll just smile and watch you burn\n\n\n\nThey lift you up\n\nYou take your turn\n\n(You'll see it, when you achieve it)\n\nThey light that spark\n\n(You can't fight it)\n\nThen sit back and watch you burn\n\n\n\nThey lift you up\n\n(You might feel it, but don't believe it)\n\nGive you your task\n\n(You'll see it, when you achieve it)\n\nWhen your world goes dark\n\n(You can't hide it)\n\nThey'll just smile and watch you burn"
