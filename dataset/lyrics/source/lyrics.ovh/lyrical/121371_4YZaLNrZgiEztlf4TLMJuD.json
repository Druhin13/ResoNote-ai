  "lyrics": "[VERSE 1:]\r\nI don't know what it is that you've done to me \nBut it's caused me to act in such a crazy way \nWhatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing \nIt's a feeling that I want to stay \n'Cuz my heart starts beating triple time \n\nWith thoughts of lovin' you on my mind \n\nI can't figure out just what to do \n\nWhen the cause and cure is you, you \n\n\n\n[CHORUS:]\n\nI get so weak in the knees \n\nI can hardly speak, I lose all control \n\nThen somethin' takes over me \n\nIn a daze, your love's so amazing \n\nIt's not a phase \n\nI want you to stay with me, by my side \n\nI swallow my pride \n\nYour love is so sweet, it knocks me right off of my feet \n\nCan't explain why your lovin' makes me weak \n\n\n\n[VERSE 2:]\n\nTime after time after time I've tried to fight it \n\nBut your love is strong, it keeps on holdin' on \n\nResistance is down when you're around, pride's fading \n\nIn my condition I don't want to be alone \n\n'Cuz my heart starts beating triple time \n\nWith thoughts of lovin' you on my mind \n\nI can't figure out just what to do \n\nWhen the cause and cure is you, you \n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n\n\n[BRIDGE:]\n\nI've tried hard to fight it \n\nNo way can I deny it \n\nYour love's so sweet \n\nIt knocks me off my feet \n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n\n\n[BRIDGE 2:]\n\nI get so weak \n\nBlood starts racing through my veins \n\nI get so weak \n\nBoy it's somethin' I can't explain \n\nI get so weak \n\nSomethin' 'bout the way you do the things you're do-oo-oo-in' \n\nKnocks me right off of my feet (off my feet)\n\nCan't explain why your lovin' makes me weak (I get so)\n\n\n\n[CHORUS TO FADE]"
