  "lyrics": "You stay out so late -\r\nJust to build connection\r\nThey say, “Hey, man you were great.”\r\nBut they don’t even have the slightest affection\r\nThat you’re really not doing okay\r\nAnd maybe tonight you could barely even play\n\n\n\nThe show it must go on even if they don’t even come\n\nThe colors and the callous turn you into a strange and silent one\n\n\n\nAnd maybe if you were harsh?\n\nMaybe if you weren’t you people would seem to care about what it is you even do?\n\nMaybe if you tried harder to seem like you didn’t love it- but you do\n\nBut they’re better than you\n\n\n\nDon’t give into fodder\n\nAnd don’t pander a smile\n\nAnd give yourself a second\n\nAnd give yourself a while\n\nBut believe all that you hear\n\nAnd assume that they’re all watching\n\nAnd force some words out of your mouth\n\nWhile all their eyes are watching\n\n\n\nAnd maybe if you were harsh?\n\nMaybe if you weren’t you people would seem to care about what it is you even do?\n\nMaybe if you tried harder to seem like you didn’t love it- but you do\n\nBut they’re better than you"
