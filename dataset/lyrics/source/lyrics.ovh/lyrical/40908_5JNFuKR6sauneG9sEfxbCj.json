  "lyrics": "Well, it's a change in the ocean, change in the sea\r\nWoke up one morning was a change in me\r\nI put on my pants, my pants fell down\r\nWell, I put on my shoes and they fell off too\r\nI looked in the mirror, was nothing to see\r\nThat's how it goes when you're a shrinking man like me\n\n\n\nWorried man with a worried song\n\nShrinking man ain't gonna be here long\n\n\n\nWell, sometimes I worry 'bout clothes\n\n'Cause a shrinking man's got to look good sometime\n\nDon't need no sweatshop child\n\nPuttin' shoes on my feet this time\n\nChained to a sewing machine\n\nDown in hell where the sun don't shine\n\nLook as good as you can\n\nBut please don't rob your fellow man\n\n\n\nShrinking man, shrinking man\n\nNobody was worried 'bout a shrinking man\n\n\n\nSometimes I worry 'bout food\n\n'Cause a shrinking man's got to eat right sometime\n\nI don't need much and I don't pay\n\nNo starvation wage\n\nTo poor folks out on the poison ground\n\nYou don't rob the land\n\nWhen you're just a little old shrinking man\n\n\n\nShrinking man, shrinking man\n\nNobody was worried 'bout a shrinking man\n\nWorried man with a worried song\n\nShrinking man ain't gonna be here long\n\n\n\nSometimes I worry bout prayer\n\n'Cause a shrinking man better be a prayin' man\n\nOnce I had a dream that was working\n\nI had good ideas, I made big plans\n\nNow I'm just like a leaf in the wind that's blowing\n\nI hope King Jesus can understand\n\n\n\nShrinking man, shrinking man\n\nNobody was worried 'bout a shrinking man\n\nWorried man with a worried song\n\nShrinking man ain't gonna be here long"
