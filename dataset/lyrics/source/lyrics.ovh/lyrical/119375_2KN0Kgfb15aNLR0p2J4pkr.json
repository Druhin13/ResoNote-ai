  "lyrics": "With the news there's something every day\r\nSo many people thinking different ways, you say\r\nWhere is the music?\r\nA tune to free the soul\r\nA simple lyric, to unite us all, you know\n\nYour opinion only knows the one thing that you seem to have most, and you chose\n\nTo save yourself in your own time you'll have to stay open up your own, mind\n\n\n\nAnd every glow in the twilight knows\n\nThat the world is only what the world is made of\n\nJust you and me can agree to disagree\n\nAnd the world is only what the world is made of\n\n\n\nIn all the noise facing every day\n\nThe colored world has turned into grey, you say\n\nAnd from the void, the place in which we came\n\nCan we step back and see we want the same\n\n\n\nYour opinion only knows the one thing that you seem to have most, and you chose\n\nTo save yourself in your own time you'll have to stay open up your own, mind\n\n(Heeey)\n\n\n\nAnd every glow in the twilight knows\n\nThat the world is only what the world is made of\n\nJust you and me can agree to disagree\n\nAnd the world is only what the world is made of\n\n\n\nAnd every glow in the twilight knows\n\nThat the world is only what the world is made of\n\nJust you and me can agree to disagree\n\nAnd the world is only what the world is made of"
