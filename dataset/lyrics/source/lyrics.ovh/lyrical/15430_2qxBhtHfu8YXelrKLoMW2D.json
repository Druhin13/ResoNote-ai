  "lyrics": "I'm a young sidewinder, a high note finder\r\nA fiddler, a gypsy, and a wandering soul\r\nI'm a little bit crazy, a little bit lazy\r\nAnd I don't feel at home unless I'm on the road\r\nI got rambling fever down deep in my bones\n\nFrom backroads and byways to places unknown\n\nFrom wasteland to Graceland or wherever I roam\n\nAnd I'm never alone on the road\n\n\n\nI'm a cigarette smoker, a corny joke joker\n\nBut I can get mean when my back's on the wall\n\nI'm a helluva drinker and weird thought thinker\n\nAnd I do things my way or no way at all\n\n\n\nI got rambling fever down deep in my bones\n\nFrom backroads and byways to places unknown\n\nFrom wasteland to Graceland or wherever I roam\n\nAnd I'm never alone on the road\n\n\n\nI can get mighty squirrelly, a little bit surly\n\nBut everything changes when you're moving along\n\nUncomfortable silence, we'll leave that behind us\n\nAnd write it all down in the words of a song\n\n\n\nI got rambling fever down deep in my bones\n\nFrom backroads and byways to places unknown\n\nFrom wasteland to Graceland or ever I roam\n\nAnd I'm never alone on the road\n\n\n\nI've got Willie and Waylon\n\nAnd Haggard and Jones\n\nLefty and Shaver and Kristofferson\n\nPassing by white lines reminds me of home\n\n\n\nAnd I'm never alone on the road\n\nAnd I'm never alone on the road"
