  "lyrics": "Airborne pathogens\r\nA contorting carcinoma multiplies without end\r\nInvasive genophagia, irreversible damage\r\nDismantling and reassembling their nucleic acid\r\nShambling eldritch beast, a mindless vector of disease\n\nThe brain erodes, flesh calcifies, controlled by endoparasites\n\nYour mind and body are not your own, play host to hostile lifeforms\n\nUnseen, explosive haze, with every breath you become their slave\n\n\n\nThis world was never yours to begin with\n\nAnd nor will it be in the end\n\n\n\nAs you devour, so shall you be\n\nThis plague never replete\n\nAgainst this foe there is no victory\n\nSelf-destruction written in the genes\n\n\n\nThe wilderness reclaims these empty streets\n\nHistory is forgotten\n\nOnce thriving metropolises now mortuaries\n\nDerelict, old and rotten\n\n\n\nTheir cradle is our grave, new life born of decay\n\n\n\nWe prosper from their ruin\n\nAs our progeny lament, we will not be forgiven\n\nThe storm on the horizon writes their names in the sky\n\nAs we gamble the future on the roll of a dice"
