  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson A Man; a Man Without Warning (certified) par L.A. Salami\r\nA boy lives in his early dreams\nA roofless tomb, a fearless song\nHe don't know a thing to keep him faithful\nBut faith alone can get you by\n\nBut slowly, day-by-day\nThat blissful sleep, it wears away\nAnd he must steal a dream to keep him faithful\n'Cause dreams alone can get you by\n\n'Cause you're alive without warning\nAh, the shift has come\nAnd he must answer without swaying\nAh, when the change is done\n\nEyes open now with a sense of self\n\nA lustful babe, he applies his wealth\nIn untouched air that he's fond of breathing\n'Cause life alone can get you by\n\nBut the more he looks, the more he sees\nThe total view don't come easily\nA landscape scar on his periph'ral\n'Cause looks alone won't get you by\n\n'Cause you could die without warning\nAh, the shift has come\nAnd you must answer without swaying\nAh, when the change is done\n\nBut eventually his eyes were faded\nHis view will shake and he will pine on days\nHe always knew that is would come, but it still surprises him\n\nHow all this time can just go by\n\nAnd then he's older without warning\nAh, the shift has come\nAnd he must answer without swaying\nAh, when the change is done\n\nAnd he's older without warning\nThe shift has come\nAnd he must answer without swaying\nWhen the change is done"
