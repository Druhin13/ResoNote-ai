  "lyrics": "All the men before me swollen with seed\r\nScraped the earth nude and clean\r\nGround to till, air to breathe\r\nWith missteps for no one\r\nWhen we drew this, our best plans\n\nImperial, with no regrets\n\n\n\nShe needs to love me still\n\nUntil I've had my fill\n\nI try and try to leave\n\nI want to watch you grieve\n\n\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\n\n\nHostile as I once was\n\nAnd I once was cruel\n\nPiles of dust immolate\n\nAll in the same room\n\nWith missteps for no one\n\n\n\nWhen we drew this, our dark map\n\nIn heaven there are no regrets\n\n\n\nShe needs to love me still\n\nUntil I've had my fill\n\nI try and try to leave\n\nI want to watch you grieve\n\n\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\n\n\nShe needs to love me still\n\nUntil I've had my fill\n\nI try and try to leave\n\nI want to watch you grieve\n\n\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\nNow we all dream alone\n\nNow we all dream alone"
