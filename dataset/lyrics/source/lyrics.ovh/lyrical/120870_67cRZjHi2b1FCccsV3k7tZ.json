  "lyrics": "Meet a girl, hit it off\r\nLet it burn, then she's gone in a month\r\nAnother girl, another date\r\nBut it feels like a table for one\r\nI was done with the same old distractions\r\nI'd given up on falling in love\n\nThen it happened when I met her\n\nEpidemic out of nowhere\n\n\n\nI started losing sleep, couldn't catch a wink\n\nHigh fever in the sheets, knees getting weak\n\nMy heart was skipping beats, she was running deep\n\nLike a toxin that's all in my system\n\nI got symptoms, I'm so in it, she's so different\n\nComing down with a case of her love\n\n\n\nI don't need a prescription\n\nYou don't gotta talk to the doctor\n\n'Cause a shot in the arm or a shock to the heart couldn't stop her\n\nShe's dangerous, yeah she's contagious\n\nI'm coming down with a case of her love\n\nDon't need saving, DNR\n\nI've been craving more and more since\n\n\n\nI started losing sleep, couldn't catch a wink\n\nHigh fever in the sheets, knees getting weak\n\nMy heart was skipping beats, she was running deep\n\nLike a toxin that's all in my system\n\nI got symptoms\n\n\n\nEpidemic when I met her\n\nYeah, it happened out of nowhere\n\n\n\nI started losing sleep, couldn't catch a wink\n\nHigh fever in the sheets, knees getting weak\n\nMy heart was skipping beats, she was running deep\n\nLike a toxin that's all in my system\n\nWhen Moxie and ol' Penicillin gonna stop these symptoms\n\n\n\nI got symptoms\n\nHey, coming down with a case of her love\n\nI got symptoms"
