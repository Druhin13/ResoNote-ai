  "lyrics": "Have you ever wished you could rewind\r\nPick up all the pieces of the life you left behind\r\nHave you ever lived on borrowing time\r\nKnowing your mistakes are chasing you down from behind\r\nBut, don't hold me, cause I am falling back down\n\nAnd I wouldn't wanna see you\n\nHit the ground\n\n\n\nBut little darling you found my heart in the lost and found\n\nBut the scars they still follow me around\n\n\n\nAnd I know its hard to replace\n\nBut the feelings that you had for me, will one day be erased\n\nOh and you will learn to move on\n\nLike footprints in the snow\n\nThe last winter wind is gone\n\n\n\nBut, don't hold me, cause I am falling back down\n\nAnd I wouldn't wanna see you\n\nHit the ground\n\nBut little darling you found my heart in the lost and found\n\nBut the scars they still follow me around\n\n\n\nAnd the dark surrounds your heart and you're on free fall\n\nOh you must let go of me\n\nCause if you keep me you will lose it all\n\nSo darling don't please, please\n\n\n\nDon't hold me cause I am falling back down\n\nAnd I wouldn't wanna see you hit the ground\n\n\n\nWell little darling you found my heart in the lost and found\n\nBut the scars they still follow me around\n\nWell they follow me around\n\n\n\nAnd no, oh, oh\n\nThey follow me around"
