  "lyrics": "Every word I said\r\nEchoes in my head\r\nLike ghosts that haunt the night\r\nI'm living one last time\r\nVisions of us fade away\r\nThe mirror we can hide\n\nForever now we'll stay away\n\n\n\nLife took another turn\n\nA hurricane has washed away\n\nThe fire that once burned\n\nTime taking our true spark\n\nChosen but we gave away\n\nThe beat to your broken heart\n\nI can't put it back together\n\nNo, I won't put it back together\n\nThis is where it ends\n\n\n\nDreams will come and end\n\nLiving with my sin\n\nA fear that burns so bright\n\nI lie awake at night\n\nMissing my heart everyday\n\nI know inside it's time\n\nTo end this now and face today\n\n\n\nLife took another turn\n\nA hurricane has washed away\n\nThe fire that once burned\n\nTime taking our true spark\n\nChosen but we gave away\n\nThe beat to your broken heart\n\nI can't put it back together\n\nNo, I won't put it back together\n\nThis is where it ends\n\n\n\nLife took another turn\n\nA hurricane has washed away\n\nThe fire that once burned\n\nTime taking our true spark\n\nChosen but we gave away\n\nThe beat to your broken heart\n\nI can't put it back together\n\nNo, I won't put it back together\n\nThis is where it ends"
