  "lyrics": "What's it been, over a decade?\r\nIt still smarts like it was four minutes ago\r\nWe only influenced each other, totally\r\nWe only bruised each other even more so\r\nWhat are you my blood? You touch me like you are my blood\n\nWhat are you my dad? You affect me like you are my dad\n\n\n\nHow long can a girl be shackled to you\n\nHow long before my dignity is reclaimed\n\nHow long can a girl stay haunted by you\n\nSoon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name\n\nSoon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name\n\n\n\nWhere've you been? I heard you moved to my city\n\nMy brother saw you somewhere downtown\n\nI'd be paralyzed if I ran into you\n\nMy tongue would seize up if we were to meet again\n\n\n\nWhat are you my god? You touch me like you are my god\n\nWhat are you my twin? You affect me like you are my twin\n\n\n\nHow long can a girl be tortured by you?\n\nHow long before my dignity is reclaimed\n\nAnd how long can a girl be haunted by you\n\nSoon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name\n\nSoon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name\n\n\n\nSo here I am one room away from where I know you're standing\n\nA well-intentioned man told me you just walked in\n\nThis man knows not of how this information has affected me\n\nBut he knows the colour of the car I just drove away in\n\n\n\nWhat are you my kin? You touch me like you are my kin\n\nWhat are you my air? You affect me like you are my air\n\n\n\nAnd how long can a girl be tortured by you? \n\nAnd how long before my dignity is reclaimed \n\nAnd how long can a girl be haunted by you \n\nSoon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name \n\nSoon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name"
