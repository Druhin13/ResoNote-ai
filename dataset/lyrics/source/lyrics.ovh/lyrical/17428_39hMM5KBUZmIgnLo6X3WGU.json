  "lyrics": "Maybe I could be the person to catch you on the other side\r\nThat's gonna hold you for life\r\nOr maybe I could be the reason that your eyes are crying dry\r\n'Cause I can't treat you right\r\n'Cause what if life happens?\n\nIt ain't as good as it was\n\n'Cause the girl that used to be me, when I look back now\n\nDon't know who it was\n\n\n\nI love you right now, but will I love you forever?\n\nForever\n\nMy heart beats so loud but my mind is still tender\n\nStill tender\n\n\n\nMaybe all our good intentions will just wash over us\n\n'Cause we got caught in the rush\n\nGuess you never see it coming when the light switches off\n\nAnd you're lying in the rough\n\n\n\n'Cause sometimes life happens\n\nIt ain't as good as it was\n\n'Cause the girl that used to be me got her head down now\n\nDon't know who to trust\n\n\n\nI love you right now, but will I love you forever?\n\nForever\n\nMy heart beats so loud but my mind is still tender\n\nStill tender\n\nI know I made a promise but I'm just being honest\n\n'Cause the nights got too long\n\nI couldn't stand to be alone\n\nI love you right now, but will I love you forever?\n\nForever\n\n\n\nGive me time, give me time\n\nGive me time, give me time\n\n'Cause the girl that I'm gonna be in the white dress one day will know what she wants\n\nGive me time, give me time\n\nGive me time, give me time\n\n'Cause the girl that I'm gonna be in the white dress one day will know who she loves\n\n\n\nI love you right now, but will I love you forever?\n\nForever\n\nMy heart beats so loud but my mind is still tender\n\nStill tender\n\nI know I made a promise but I'm just being honest\n\n'Cause the nights got too long\n\nI couldn't stand to be alone\n\nI love you right now, but will I love you forever?\n\nForever"
