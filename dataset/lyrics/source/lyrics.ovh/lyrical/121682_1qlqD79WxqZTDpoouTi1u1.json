  "lyrics": "Let it rain\r\nLet it rain\r\nFrom the first day I met ya\r\nI notice your style Had that B-Boy swagger not one of the crowd\r\nAnd you talked like you knew me\n\nKept coming around and I fell for ya, yeah\n\nThen as time kept going I notice somethings\n\nSaid our love kept growing\n\nWanted to runaway cause the situation's in the past\n\nLove never really last\n\nMemories just had a hold of me\n\n\n\nBut I had to let go of the pain Let love rain down on me (let it rain)\n\nCause you helped me open up my eyes\n\nShow me things I could never see (let it rain)\n\nCause we can fight and we make up\n\nWanna see you when I wake up\n\nI'm staying with you only (let it rain)\n\nCause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)\n\n\n\nI use to wonder where were going\n\nAnd where I wanted to be\n\nSitting alone all shocked up waiting for my destiny\n\nHearing songs on the radio wishing that could happen to me, oh no\n\nThen when you came into the picture then I knew quickly\n\nThat we could build something so strong\n\nExpect the best for the future\n\nForget about what used to be\n\nneed you here all life long\n\n\n\nBut I had to let go of the pain\n\nLet love rain down on me (let it rain)\n\nCause you helped me open up my eyes\n\nShow me things I could never see (let it rain)\n\nCause we can fight and we make up\n\nWanna see you when I wake up\n\nI'm staying with you only (let it rain)\n\nCause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)\n\n\n\nCause I see the sunlight whenever we touch\n\nAll day and all night is never too much (All that were how)\n\nAfraid of my feelings and falling too deep\n\nBut everybodys had this happen one time or another\n\nWhen you need someone to set your heart free\n\n\n\nBut I had to let go of the pain\n\nLet love rain down on me (let it rain down down on me)\n\nCause you helped me open up my eyes\n\nShow me things I could never see (let it rain)\n\nCause we could fight and we make up\n\nI wanna see you when I wake up\n\nI'm staying with you only (let it rain)\n\nCause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)\n\n\n\nBut I had to let go of the pain\n\nLet love rain down on me (down on me baby)\n\nCause you help me open up my eyes\n\nShow me things I could never see (let it rain)\n\nCause we can fight and we make up\n\nWanna see you when I wake up\n\nI'm staying with you only (let it rain)\n\nCause I need you to show me how our love should really be (let it rain)\n\n\n\nLet it rain\n\nLet it rain\n\nLet it rain \n\n\n\n(Thanks to Solidsnake2006 for these lyrics)"
