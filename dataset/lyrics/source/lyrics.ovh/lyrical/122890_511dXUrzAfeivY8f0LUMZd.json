  "lyrics": "Summer's end's around the bend just flyin'\r\nThe swimmin' suits are on the line just dryin'\r\nI'll meet you there for our conversation\r\nI hope I didn't ruin your whole vacation\r\nWell you never know how far from home you're feelin'\n\nUntil you've watched the shadows cross the ceilin'\n\nWell I don't know, but I can see it snowin'\n\nIn your car the windows are wide open\n\n\n\nJust come on home\n\nCome on home\n\nNo you don’t have to\n\nBe alone\n\nJust come on home\n\n\n\nValentine’s break hearts and minds at random\n\nThat ol' Easter egg ain’t got a leg to stand on\n\nWell I can see that you can’t win for tryin'\n\nAnd New Year's Eve is bound to leave you cryin'\n\n\n\nCome on home\n\nCome on home\n\nNo you don’t have to\n\nBe alone\n\nJust come on home\n\n\n\nThe moon and stars hang out in bars just talkin'\n\nI still love that picture of us walkin'\n\nJust like that ol' house we thought was haunted\n\nSummer’s end came faster than we wanted\n\n\n\nCome on home\n\nCome on home\n\nNo you don’t have to\n\nBe alone\n\nCome on home\n\nCome on home\n\nYou don’t have to\n\nBe alone\n\nJust come on home"
