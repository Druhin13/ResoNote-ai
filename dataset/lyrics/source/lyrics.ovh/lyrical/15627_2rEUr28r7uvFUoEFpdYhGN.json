  "lyrics": "Well, since my baby left me,\r\nI found a new place to dwell.\r\nIt's down at the end of lonely street\r\nat Heartbreak Hotel.\r\nYou make me so lonely baby,\n\nI get so lonely,\n\nI get so lonely I could die.\n\n\n\nAnd although it's always crowded,\n\nyou still can find some room.\n\nWhere broken hearted lovers\n\ndo cry away their gloom.\n\n\n\nYou make me so lonely baby,\n\nI get so lonely,\n\nI get so lonely I could die.\n\n\n\nWell, the Bell hop's tears keep flowin',\n\nand the desk clerk's dressed in black.\n\nWell they been so long on lonely street\n\nThey ain't ever gonna look back.\n\n\n\nYou make me so lonely baby,\n\nI get so lonely,\n\nI get so lonely I could die.\n\n\n\nHey now, if your baby leaves you,\n\nand you got a tale to tell.\n\nJust take a walk down lonely street\n\nto Heartbreak Hotel."
