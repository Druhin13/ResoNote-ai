Turn that music down.”\r\nShit, she always tryna, right when I was about to fuck\r\nAight; Hold on girl\r\nI switch up the motion to show ya to show ya I’m for real\r\nSo girl come on over and show me and show me you know this\n\nI’m tired of frontin damn baby girl you so flawless\n\nI'll show you how rare you are, make the whole universe notice\n\nI’ve been working 9-5 been up for days can’t sleep at night\n\nTo give you lucid dreams and make you fall for me all thru the night\n\nI can’t get enough\n\n(I’ll show you how rare you, show you how, show you how rare you are)\n\nI can’t get enough of you\n\n(I’ll show you how rare you, show you how, show you how rare you are)\n\nI can’t get enough of you\n\n(I’ll show you how rare you, show you how, show you how rare you are)"
