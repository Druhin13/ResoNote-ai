You went to school that day\n\nIt was a bit late, but it wasn't Monday\n\nKept at the class for answering back\n\nYou apologized, then you were coming out\n\n(I wanna turn those blue lights)\n\nWhat have you done?\n\n(Into strobe lights)\n\nThere's no need to run if you've done nothing wrong\n\nBlue lights should just pass you by.\n\n\n\nGun crime into your right,\n\nDrugs and violence into your left\n\nPeople with headphones flooding the order\n\nInto a subconscious way\n\nYou accept, you're sitting on the fall back home\n\n(Where you're at? Why'd don't you answer your phone?)\n\nPulls the poison to answer his message\n\nYour voice sounds rush, fists are his lesson\n\n(I wanna turn those blue lights)\n\nWhat have you done?\n\n(Into strobe lights)\n\nThere's no need to run if you've done nothing wrong\n\nBlue lights should just pass you by.\n\n\n\nTall black shadow as you're getting off the bush\n\nShadow shows no emotion, so what's even the fuzz?\n\nBut the face saw you boy, as a darker pitch of the\n\n(Look blood, I'm sorry\n\n'Cause I know you got my back\n\nI was running, I couldn't think\n\nI had to get out of there)\n\nNot long ago, you and mamy took the shook\n\nNow what's really is part two, 'cause you're the shook one\n\nHands to the tool as you question your friendship\n\nIs a man like you gonna make me a convict?\n\nNever ever felt, I've done nothing wrong\n\nBlood on my hands, but I don't know where it's from\n\nOoh, you've got blood on your hands, but you don't know where it's from\n\n\n\nYou'd better run when you hear the sirens coming,\n\nWhen you hear the sirens coming\n\nBetter run when you hear the sirens coming 'cause they will be coming for you\n\nComing for you,\n\nRun when you hear the sirens coming\n\nBetter run when you hear the sirens coming\n\nWhen you hear the sirens coming, the blue lights are coming for you\n\n\n\n(I wanna turn those blue lights)\n\nWhat have you done?\n\n(Into strobe lights)\n\nThere's no need to run if you've done nothing wrong\n\nBlue lights should just pass you by."
