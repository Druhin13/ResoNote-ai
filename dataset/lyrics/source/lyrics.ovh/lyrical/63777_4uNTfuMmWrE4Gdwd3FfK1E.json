  "lyrics": "I'm 25 and still not living out of home\r\nGot two degrees and I'm stuck working on the phone\r\nSo, damn our entitled generation\r\nDamn our entitled generation\r\nI hear inflation keeps on going through the roof\n\nBut baby boomers got two condos left to spruce\n\nSo, damn our entitled generation\n\nDamn our entitled generation\n\n\n\nThe living wage is slipping, but the budget's spent\n\nI'm firing words; don't worry, there's no ill intent\n\nI can't keep sitting here, but like Mark Twain once said\n\nDon't vote for politicians, that only encourages them\n\n\n\nThese worried kids you made, you made us who we are\n\nAge of participation trophies and gold stars\n\nDamn our entitled generation\n\nDamn our entitled generation\n\n\n\nDosed up on Ritalin, so we could hardly speak\n\nOur folks would fight over who had us for that week\n\nOh, damn our entitled generation\n\nDamn our entitled generation\n\n\n\nThe moral code is slipping, in our own defence\n\nThey killed off romance when they birthed the Internet\n\nIt feels this legacy is one unholy mess\n\nThere's an old saying that goes, 'What you plant is what you get'\n\n\n\nDamn our entitled generation\n\nDamn our entitled generation\n\n\n\nThe telly told us who to be with plastic gloss\n\nSuburban dreams are down the drain, the market's shot\n\nI can't explain how bad it feels to be so lost\n\nAt least with medicine, life expectancy has now gone up"
