  "lyrics": "It was a malfunction\r\nNothing short of a disconnection\r\nI got dizzy right before the rapid detachments\r\nI refuse to accept what's really going on\r\nJust once you think that it's alright\r\nIt's all wrong\n\n\n\nIt was a malfunction, it was a malfunction\n\n\n\nIt was a malfunction\n\nIt was hard to grasp it\n\nThe truth of you leaving me behind\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\n\n\nResurrect my aching cells\n\nLet's restart my aging health\n\n\n\nBreath in, blow out\n\nSimply repeat these steps\n\nBreath in, blow out\n\nSimply repeat these steps\n\n\n\nKeep me close\n\nKeep me close, that's what you said\n\nBut you moved on\n\n\n\nIt was a malfunction\n\nThe truth of you leaving me behind\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\nIt was a malfunction\n\nIt was hard to grasp it\n\nThe truth of you leaving me behind\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\n\n\nResurrect my aching cells\n\nLet's restart my aging health\n\n\n\nSoon the frost will fill my head\n\nNo melting or thawing\n\nConstantly just thickens\n\nIt's a message, you went a head in\n\nI guess I lost my spine\n\nI guess I fell behind\n\n\n\nThe cold's just not my friend\n\nIt's a message, it's a message\n\nThe frost will fill my head\n\nIt's a message, it's a message\n\nIt's a message, it's a message\n\nIt is a message"
