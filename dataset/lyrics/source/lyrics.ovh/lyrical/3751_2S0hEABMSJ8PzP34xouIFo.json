  "lyrics": "Ya\r\nI got the feeling\r\nThat I'm finna be getting my, feeling\r\nI got wishes beginning to\r\nUnderstand I'm only one man\r\nWith only one life\n\nThat's all I want\n\nDamn I got to clean out the gutter\n\nThe rain hits the same pain and it's pulling me under\n\nSlam, wake up, a young Jake up\n\nMy makeup is tangled, in between the devil and an angel\n\nStranger things, I see it in my dreams\n\nDouble up the covers but it's never what it seems\n\nAngry, jeans twisted in the seams\n\nHeart is in my pocket\n\nTake it throw it in the leaves\n\n\n\nI've seen things about me\n\nI believe reality\n\nTeasing abolish\n\nI retrieve my solace\n\nI've seen things about me\n\nI believe reality\n\nTeasing abolish\n\nI retrieve my solace\n\n\n\nI got something dark in my thoughts\n\nPick it up, throw it off\n\nGive it up, or go off? I go off\n\nI show off with words that are on my mind sometimes I rhyme to find\n\nThe peace of mind released the binds, and shine\n\nShining like no one's watching, life is not a movie\n\nIt's more like an avalanche, try not to let it move me\n\nFeeling under pressure, that's a true story\n\nI worry about the future, heading straight to purgatory\n\nMy heaven is out of reach, at least close to the beach\n\nBut I rather be at mountain tops, look over the seas\n\nNo rainbows, pain slow, guess that's how the game goes\n\nSee the storm in distance, put on my raincoat\n\n\n\nI've seen things about me\n\nI believe reality\n\nTeasing abolish\n\nI retrieve my solace\n\nI've seen things about me\n\nI believe reality\n\nTeasing abolish\n\nI retrieve my solace\n\n\n\nOn a daily basis, I'm chasing places that only exist\n\nInside my head, and where I'm headed I persist\n\nOn this voyage over the seas, I bleed, I know I'm breathing\n\nTrees seem deceased til it's another season\n\nChanges, had some fallen dreams, rearrange them\n\nTry to put the past behind me, still I feel the anchor weigh\n\nSave my sorries for some other day\n\nFeel like the product of misery\n\nBlizzard's only in my way, but I treck, and I treck\n\nThrough the swamps, I won't quit\n\nI won't stop til I get to the top, to the top\n\nNow this is the destination I've chosen, the final place that I'm hoping I go to when I feel hopeless, now you know it\n\n\n\nI've seen things about me\n\nI believe reality\n\nTeasing abolish\n\nI retrieve my solace\n\nI've seen things about me\n\nI believe reality\n\nTeasing abolish\n\nI retrieve my solace"
