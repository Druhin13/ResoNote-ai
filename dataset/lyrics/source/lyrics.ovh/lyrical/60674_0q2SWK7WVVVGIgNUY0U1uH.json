  "lyrics": "You're never gone\r\nI can feel your life in my veins\r\nIn every beat of blood\r\nThe recollection remains\r\nSwimming through my skin\r\nFilling my brain\n\nWatching what I've done\n\nWhen I see no-one\n\n\n\nSubconsciously I move\n\nJust like you\n\nA tranquil petrification\n\nAn indosed incarnation\n\nConsuming me\n\nTo be like you\n\nA contrasting sensation\n\nMore than just fixation\n\n\n\nHearing the words you spoke\n\nFalling out of my mouth\n\nIn the night awoke\n\nConcluding the doubt\n\nThat you are here\n\nA piece of me\n\nA coveted fear\n\nOf what I can't see\n\n\n\nHaunting me when I'm lenient\n\nAccepted when convenient"
