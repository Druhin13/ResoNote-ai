dream and acquire\n\nOn a stage us man get a \"brap brap\"\n\nIt's Eskiboy and President T in the place\n\nWe ain't gotta watch no face\n\nWe ain't gotta watch no eediat ting\n\nDone that immediate ting\n\nHyper hyper, gassed up yute\n\nThese levels you've gotta catch up too\n\nIt's like everyday I'm still vibing\n\nGet the job done now I'm finished deciding\n\n\n\nI'm sick of these gassed up

from?\"\n\nI don't really know, some might call it a gun town\n\nLord of gas, won't see one round\n\nThey were like, \"Bring this game to a close\"\n\nHow can a gassed up yute compete with the pros?\n\nI'll bring the eight to your close\n\nNah, none of these gassed up yutes done a day in jail\n\n(Gassed up, gassed up)\n\nCan't get to my scale\n\nIf you're on the scale of a fish, why you wanna fuck with the whales?\n\nWhy all the biting man, and I ain't talking nails\n\nNone of these gassed up clowns could get to my level of sales\n\n(Gassed up, gassed up)\n\n\n\nI'm sick of these
