  "lyrics": "As the first light touched the waves\r\nAnd the ravens cawed across the bay\r\nA mighty fleet with red white sails\r\nThree hundred Viking ships were\r\nOn their way\n\nWar!\n\n\n\nWith thirst for blood and all-out war\n\nA thirst that's aching through our hearts and bones\n\nWe're heading west to distant shores\n\nTo avenge our father and to win the throne\n\n\n\nThey think their God will save their skin\n\nBut all resistance will be in vain\n\nWe stare at death with crimson grins\n\nWith Odin's help we cannot fail\n\n\n\nWe hold our heads up to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as we stand side by side\n\nAs long as we can see the ravens fly!\n\nRavens fly! Ravens fly!\n\n\n\nWar!\n\n\n\nHeading to Northumbraland\n\nCome what may we won't back down\n\nWhen horns of war begin to sound\n\nAella's head will lose its crown\n\n\n\nCome what may, we hold our heads\n\nUp to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as Odin's on our side\n\n\n\nWe hold our heads up to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as we stand side by side\n\nAs long as we can see the ravens fly!\n\nRavens fly! Ravens fly!\n\n\n\nWe hold our heads up to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as we stand side by side\n\nAs long as we can see the ravens fly!\n\n\n\nWe hold our heads up to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as we stand side by side\n\nAs long as we can see the ravens fly!\n\nRavens fly! See the ravens fly!"
