  "lyrics": "I’ve been dreaming lately about you\r\nI wish you never went away\r\nWanna go back to New Year’s Day\r\nI’ve been getting so emotional\r\nNo longer feel you next to me\r\nI’m swimming in these memories\n\n\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes it’s you and me\n\nI feel your energy in all these lucid dreams\n\nI really wanted you to stay\n\nEver since you went away\n\n\n\nI’ve been walking down this lonely road\n\n## to go\n\nIs something that I can’t control\n\nI found that thing that reminds me of you\n\nI guess I gotta let it go\n\nBut I'll never let you go\n\n\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes it’s you and me\n\nI feel your energy in all these lucid dreams\n\nI really wanted you to stay\n\nEver since you went away\n\n\n\nTime goes slowly\n\nYou’re the only\n\nYou’ll come and go\n\nTil tomorrow\n\nI’ll see you again…\n\n\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes it’s you and me\n\nI feel your energy in all these lucid dreams\n\nI really wanted you to stay\n\nEver since you went away\n\n\n\nI’ve been dreaming bout you\n\nWanna let you know\n\nCan’t stop thinking bout you\n\nNever let you go\n\nYou’re my angel baby\n\nWatching over me\n\nI’ll see you again\n\nWe’ll be running free\n\n\n\nAnd every time I close my eyes it’s you and me\n\nI feel your energy in all these lucid dreams"
