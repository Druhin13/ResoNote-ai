  "lyrics": "I like the way that words come out your mouth\r\nIt takes me many miles to make them out\r\nAnd strawberry sits superbly with you\r\nGo on and lick me love I'm jelly in my shoes\r\nAnd I would tread upon flowerbeds to\n\nStare and stop\n\nA hominid twas blossoming from\n\nSoot and sod\n\nPrune\n\nEating all my food\n\n\n\nWell you're like the bum\n\nWho begged and pegged me up all wrong\n\nI've got no two cents, no sense at all\n\nWell you're like the bum\n\nWho begged and pegged me up all wrong\n\nI've got no two cents, no sense at all \n\nWell you're like the bum\n\nWho begged and pegged me up all wrong\n\nI've got no two cents, no sense at all\n\nWell you're like the bum\n\nWho begged and pegged me up all wrong\n\nI've got no two cents, no sense at all\n\n\n\nNobody like the way you decorate your neck\n\nIt takes me just a sec to break a sweat\n\nAnd russet rims portray that of a goon\n\nGo on and test me love like sipping from a spoon\n\n\n\nAnd I would tread upon flowerbeds to\n\nStare and stop\n\nA hominid twas blossoming from\n\nSoot and sod\n\nPrune\n\nEating all my food\n\n\n\nWell you're like the bum\n\nWho begged and pegged me up all wrong\n\nI've got no two cents, no sense at all\n\nWell you're like the bum\n\nWho begged and pegged me up all wrong\n\nI've got no two cents, no sense at all\n\n\n\nHa ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha\n\nHa ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha\n\nHa ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha\n\nHa ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha ha"
