  "lyrics": "Oh well, I'm tired and so weary\r\nBut I must go alone\r\nTill the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes\r\nWell the morning's so bright\r\nAnd the lamp is alight\r\nAnd the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes\n\n\n\nThere will be peace in the valley for me, some day\n\nThere will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray\n\nThere'll be no sadness, no sorrow\n\nNo trouble, trouble I see\n\nThere will be peace in the valley for me, for me\n\n\n\nWell the bear will be gentle\n\nAnd the wolves will be tame\n\nAnd the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes\n\nAnd the beasts from the wild\n\nShall be lit by a child\n\nAnd I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes\n\n\n\nThere will be peace in the valley for me, some day\n\nThere will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray\n\nThere'll be no sadness, no sorrow\n\nNo trouble, trouble I see\n\nThere will be peace in the valley for me, for me"
