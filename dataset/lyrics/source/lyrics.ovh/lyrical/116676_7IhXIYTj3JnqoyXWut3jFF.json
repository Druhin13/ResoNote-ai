  "lyrics": "Try to make a little conversation, with the demons in my mind\r\nEverybody has a first world problem, taking up their precious time\r\nOh I remember, I remember when we kissed, September\r\nNothing could compare to this, to be a lover, is to be the optimist\r\nWe’re too young to make it out\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about\n\nCan you hear the fire alarm?\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nWe’re too young to make it out\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about\n\nCan you hear the fire alarm?\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\n\n\nLovers sitting close on every bus stop, waiting for the new bazaar\n\nPretty girls in England, stealing looks and wondering just who we are\n\nOh I remember, I remember New Years Eve, her father told me\n\nSon, that I should leave, to be a lover, is to be the new naive\n\n\n\nWe’re too young to make it out\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about\n\nCan you hear the fire alarm?\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nWe’re too young to make it out\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about\n\nCan you hear the fire alarm?\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\n\n\nCause you came and you paid with a fist full of paper\n\nAnd asked for me back, and said you would be faithful\n\nCause you came and you paid with a fist full of paper\n\nAnd asked for me back, and said you would be faithful\n\nCause you came and you paid with a fist full of paper\n\nAnd asked for me back, and said you would be faithful\n\nCause you came and you paid with a fist full of paper\n\nAnd asked for me back, and said you would be faithful\n\nFaithful, faithful\n\n\n\nWe’re too young to make it out\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about\n\nCan you hear the fire alarm?\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nWe’re too young to make it out\n\nLet’s give them something to talk about\n\nCan you hear the fire alarm?\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on\n\nCause I can feel the fire coming on"
