  "lyrics": "I jumped the 45 to meet you later\r\nSo we could have all night long\r\nYou've never looked so inviting\r\nAs tonight babe\r\nGlad it's me who takes you home\n\nBut I think you'll be the death of me\n\nYou always seem to have the best of me\n\nIt's hard to know\n\nIt's so hard to tell\n\nWhen your heart is right on the carousel\n\nOn the carousel\n\n\n\nFeels like I'm eroding\n\nBut I'm melting\n\nLights become a lucid dream\n\nWell my heart's imploding\n\nI can barely breath\n\n\n\nBut I think you'll be the death of me\n\nYou always seem to have the best of me\n\nIt's hard to know\n\nIt's so hard to tell\n\nWhen your heart is right on the carousel\n\nOn the carousel\n\n\n\nCan't get enough\n\nCan't get enough of you babe\n\nCan't get enough abuse\n\nMy body's not\n\nOh and my mind is aching\n\nCan't get enough abuse\n\n\n\nBut I think you'll be the death of me\n\nYou always seem to have the best of me\n\nIt's hard to know\n\nIt's so hard to tell\n\nWhen your heart is right on the carousel\n\nOn the carousel"
