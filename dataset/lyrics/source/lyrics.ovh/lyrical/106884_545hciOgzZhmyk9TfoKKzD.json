  "lyrics": "I think I was born in the wrong generation\r\nNobody talks to me\r\nNobody is relating\r\nAm i so invisible or am I so hated\r\nWe swing our fist's and kick our legs to know we're still breathing\n\nI know what its like when you're all alone\n\nJust look in my eyes\n\nWe are so alike\n\nBlack blood\n\nBlack blood\n\nThey won't drag me to the ground\n\nUp against the world\n\nFucked at birth\n\nWhat's a life worth?\n\nBlack blood\n\n\n\nYou can kill me but i'll never fucking die\n\n(ANGRY NOISE)"
