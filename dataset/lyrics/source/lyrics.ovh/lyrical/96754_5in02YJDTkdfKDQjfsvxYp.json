  "lyrics": "Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it?\r\nAny joy it would bring, honey, the look of it\r\nWas as sweet as the sound\r\nYour head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds\r\nI couldn't hope to know that song and all its words\r\nWouldn't claim to feel the same it felt the first time it was heard\n\nI couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice\n\nWas it that or just the act of making noise that brought you joy?\n\n\n\nYou don't have to sing it right\n\nWho could call you wrong?\n\nYou put your emptiness to melody\n\nYour awful heart to song\n\nYou don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong\n\nAt best, you'll find a little remedy\n\nAt worst, the world will sing along\n\n\n\nSo honey, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\n\n\nRemember when you'd sing before we moved to it?\n\nAnd we'd scuff up our shoes, honey, the groove of it\n\nWas whatever you choose\n\nI wan't to be your lover or the fisherman's blues\n\n\n\nYou didn't always sing it right\n\nBut who could call you wrong?\n\nYou put your emptiness to melody\n\nYour awful heart to song\n\nYou don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong\n\nAt best, you'll find a little remedy\n\nAt worst, the world will sing along\n\n\n\nSo honey, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\n\n\nWho could ask to be unbroken or be brave again\n\nOr, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again?\n\nAnd who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again\n\nOr stick around until you hear that music play again?\n\n\n\nSo honey, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, sing, sing\n\n\n\nRemember when you'd sing just for the love of it?\n\nAny joy it would bring"
