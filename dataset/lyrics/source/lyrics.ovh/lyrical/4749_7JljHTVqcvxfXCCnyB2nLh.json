Guess you not—bitch, I'll call you\n\nI find it hi-larious when bad-ass bitches try to get your attention\n\nBe lookin' like fish out of water, it be for no (no) reason\n\nA chick'll drop a pencil and go, \"Oh, (oh) Jesus\"\n\nJust to bend down to get this shit to show (show) cleavage\n\nHaha, why can't y'all just ask a nigga for his number like we do y'all?\n\nI'll tell you, women don't know how to flirt\n\nAnd the ones who's bad, they ain't even gotta work\n\nThat's real shit\n\n\n\nI see it all the time, anytime I shine\n\nI'm just acknowledgin', but I'm not tryna play y'all\n\nThis is it (what?) Bad bitches can't flirt good for shit\n\nThis is it (what?) They used to me comin' out the dick\n\nReal quick (what?) like this is it, (what?)\n\nThis is it (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo!\n\nWomen don't know how to flirt (\"That's right\")\n\n\n\nYou know how I come in\n\nTalk to 'em, Chainz!\n\n\n\nOkay, came up the street like a ladder—Aladdin\n\nI bust through the hole like McFadden on Madden\n\nA matter of fact, that's a after effect\n\nIf the crime don't fit, then I'm takin' it back, now\n\nFuckin' on this bitch who wear eye contacts\n\nAnd I pulled a bitch off of eye contact\n\nAnd I had the racks since she had a nice rack\n\nMet her at Bergdorf, right by the nice racks\n\nShe said, \"Should I get a shirt to match with the hat?\n\nOr should I get the shoes that match with the slacks?\"\n\nYeah, said it's for her man, ain't gotta be, they comin'\n\nHad a lil' Uzi on me—DJ Drama\n\nNever trust a bitch, and, yeah—I never will\n\nOkay, sometimes—if she got sex appeal\n\nI meant to say—I like to have sex and take some pills\n\nI meant to say—I like to relax and make a mill'\n\nI meant to say—I like to relax and make a meal\n\nI mean, they both the same thing, but I ain't talkin' grill\n\nI ain't talkin' dinner, I ain't talkin' supper, this the bloodsucker\n\nMet the bitch at FuddRucker off Amityville\n\nShe had a man on the real, he had his hand on the steel\n\nFucked in the Camry still, I shoulda passed on the real\n\nWould have assist with her ass, I got more dimes than a pass\n\nAnd if I knew you'd do what's crazy, I wouldn't of let me smash\n\n\n\nI see it all the time, anytime I shine\n\nI'm just acknowledgin', but I'm not tryna play y'all\n\nThis is it (what?) Bad bitches can't flirt good for shit\n\nThis is it (what?) They used to me comin' out the dick\n\nReal quick (what?) like this is it, (what?)\n\nThis is it (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo! (what?) Woo!\n\nWomen don't know how to flirt (\"That's right\")\n\n\n\nYo, Chainz, Royce\n\nRemember PRhyme 1?\n\nRemember when I said, \"Word? That's how you feel up on this track?\n\nLet a bitch come and try to shit on that!\"\n\nYeah, and on that note; move on to the next one!\n\nHahahahahahahahaha!"
