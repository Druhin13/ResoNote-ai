  "lyrics": "Have you seen that blackbird?\r\nComing down the line\r\nCan't you hear that whistle blowing?\r\nPart is blowing out of time\r\nHave you seen that blackbird?\n\nI guess it's long gone now\n\nLike the wind, it carries me away\n\nAnd like the lightning, it slowly thunders\n\nWhen it rains down on me\n\nWhen it rains down\n\nWhen it rains down on me\n\n\n\nWatch as it clears\n\nWatch 'til it clears"
