  "lyrics": "You promise it's different\r\nYou swear that you listened\r\nI don't mind if you didn't\r\n'Cause I just love the sound of your voice\r\nYou role-play the good guy, lemon juice, your white lies\r\nBut I see 'em in the sunrise\n\n\n\nYou got me right in the palm of your hand and you know it\n\nOh, it's what you do\n\nSo let me drown, I'll be there with the band\n\nHit the sea bed, all I'd see is you\n\n\n\nSo give me your worst excuses, any reason to stay\n\nGive me your lips that taste of her, I'd kiss them again\n\nI'd rather you walk all over me than walk away\n\nGive me the worst of you\n\n'Cause I want you anyway\n\nSo take me to every party and just talk to your friends\n\nWhy don't you let me down, I'll let you do it again\n\nGo on and walk all over me, just don't walk away\n\nGive me the worst of you\n\n'Cause I want you anyway\n\n\n\nWe make up, but I know we'll fistfight\n\nThrough iPhones, my left hook a no-show\n\n'Cause I'll just keep letting you win\n\nBut baby, the truth is I make your excuses\n\nYou let me down and I'm used to it\n\n\n\nYou got me right in the palm of your hand and you know it\n\nOh, it's what you do\n\nSo let me drown, I'll be there with the band\n\nHit the sea bed, all I'd see is you, oh\n\n\n\nSo give me your worst excuses, any reason to stay\n\nGive me your lips that taste of her, I'd kiss them again\n\nI'd rather you walk all over me than walk away\n\nGive me the worst of you\n\n'Cause I want you anyway\n\nSo take me to every party and just talk to your friends\n\nWhy don't you let me down, I'll let you do it again\n\nGo on and walk all over me, just don't walk away\n\nGive me the worst of you\n\n'Cause I want you anyway, anyway, anyway-ay\n\n'Cause I want you anyway, anyway, anyway-ay\n\n\n\nAnother night, another dotted line\n\nI sign my heart away to you\n\nSome call it foolish, guess I'll call it art"
