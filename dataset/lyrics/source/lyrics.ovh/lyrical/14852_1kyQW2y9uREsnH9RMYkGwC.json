  "lyrics": "I said, \"I'm just a servant to my base desires\"\r\nShe said, \"I'll tell you a few things, free of charge:\r\nStay clear of jagged rock, tread careful at the higher level\r\nThis ain't no game, but you can play if that's what you want\"\r\nThen she said, \"We are just paper boats bobbing adrift afloat\n\nWhile winds of fortune shove us where they will\"\n\nWoke up coughing on the shore, called out crowd, broke and sore\n\nBack on the mainland, the chimps were coming up trumps\n\n\n\nAnd all I saw was burning blue fading into blonde and white\n\nWade out past the rotting pier, out to the open water\n\nSon of a red-roof city and her, the full moon's daughter\n\n\n\nI'm back on the mainland, back on the mainland\n\nCool change was rolling over, black sky was getting lower\n\nOn golden sands\n\n\n\nWe stared into the haze, ocean merging with sky\n\nWe talked about the land of our fore-mothers\n\nNow that we've shut the gate, it would be funny if it\n\nDidn't make you want to cry\n\nThis is just the bed we've woken up in\n\n\n\nAnd all I saw was burning blue fading into blonde and white\n\nWade out past the rotting pier, out to the open water\n\nSon of a red-roof city and her, the full moon's daughter\n\n\n\nI'm back on the mainland, back on the mainland\n\nCool change was rolling over, black sky was getting lower\n\nGreen dreams were folding over as we sailed up the mainland\n\n\n\n\n\nNever coming off the line\n\nWake up feeling fine\n\nHer eyes on the pale moonlight\n\nFar corner of the earth\n\nTripping up on the edge\n\nBig impossible now"
