  "lyrics": "I tied a ribbon in my hair and tried my best to smile\r\nHow I believed that I could change who I was with a new style\r\nBut I forgot it only takes a little confidence\r\nAnd in the moment our eyes met, I remembered that...\n\nYou can be courageous if you try, no matter who you are\n\nWith a little magic we can cast a secret spell\n\n\n\nIT'S SHOW TIME!\n\n\n\nDoki doki - Make my heart beat\n\nAll these feelings racing inside of me\n\nI wanna show you who I really am, so will you hear my out?\n\n\n\nBaby, Baby - I hope you can see\n\nThat you truly do mean the world to me\n\nAll of my love, I'll send it all to you\n\nI hope you accept it, MY SWEET HEART!"
