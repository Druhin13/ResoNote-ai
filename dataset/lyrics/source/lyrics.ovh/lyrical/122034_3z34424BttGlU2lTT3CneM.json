  "lyrics": "In the summer\r\nYou said you loved me like an animal\r\nStayed beside me\r\nJust enough to keep your belly full\r\nThen you took me down to the water\r\nGot your mouth all clean\n\nLeft me drowning\n\nOnce you picked me out your bloody teeth\n\n\n\nSpent the autumn\n\nIn the forest hunting for a wolf\n\nTried to find you\n\nStopped my searching when the nights grew cold\n\nDreamt I saw you\n\nDown by the water with your mouth still clean\n\nYou were searching\n\nI came to you and you said to me\n\nThat I'm not-\n\n\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\n\n\nThrough the winter\n\nI was shuddered in between my sheets\n\nChecked the window\n\nJust to see if youâ€™d come back to me\n\nThe spring was coming\n\nI saw you running down to the creek\n\nThe ring finger fell to the water from your bloody teeth\n\nI guess I'm-\n\n\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while\n\nOnly what you wanted for a little while"
