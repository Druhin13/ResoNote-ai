  "lyrics": "Softspoken, if ever out loud\r\nThese days not much gets out\r\nMy mind [?] through the past\r\nBut never takes time to finish the act\r\nCan I shoulder the burden?\n\nCan I stomach the past?\n\n\n\nWatch me try to stand steady\n\nLike a flame in the pouring rain\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\nWatch me try to stand steady\n\nLike a bird in a hurricane\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\n\n\nNo matter how cold it might get\n\nMy bed sheets are laced with regret\n\nI try to fill in the lines, rework the plans for a better design\n\n\n\nCan I shoulder the burden?\n\nCan I stomach the past?\n\n\n\nWatch me try to stand steady\n\nLike a flame in the pouring rain\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\nWatch me try to stand steady\n\nLike a bird in a hurricane\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\n\n\nHere I am, bearing every burden\n\nHere I am, showing every worry\n\nTo the world\n\nTo the world\n\n\n\nWatch me try to stand steady\n\nLike a flame in the pouring rain\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\nWatch me try to stand steady\n\nLike a bird in a hurricane\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\nLooking back on my youth, it's good that I've grown\n\n\n\nWatch me try"
