  "lyrics": "I've been wrestling with my thoughts, I've been searching for daylight\r\nTryin' to make sense of the mess, tryin' to feel like I'm alright\r\nAll these questions without answers\r\nFeelin' restless and abandoned\r\nWill You hear my call?\n\nWill You be there when I fall?\n\nYou say...\n\n\n\nAll of this time and I've never let you down\n\nI carried you then, I'll carry you here and now\n\nSo don't lose heart and don't forget\n\nMy work in you ain't finished yet\n\nHold on to me now, I'll never let you down\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI won't let you down\n\nBelieve in me, I won't let you down\n\nNe-ver let you down\n\nLet you down, let you down\n\n\n\nOh, I've seen You showing up in the darkest of places\n\nIn the moments of my doubt, in the tears that I've tasted\n\nWould You take me, take me this far?\n\nJust to leave me, that's not who You are\n\n\n\nI know You hear my call\n\nYou're always there when I fall\n\nYou say...\n\n\n\nAll of this time and I've never let you down\n\n(I've never let you down)\n\nI carried you then, I'll carry you here and now\n\n(I'll carry you here and now)\n\nSo don't lose heart and don't forget\n\nMy work in you ain't finished yet\n\nHold on to me now, I'll never let you down\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI won't let you down\n\nBelieve in me, I won't let you down\n\nNe-ver let you down\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI won't let you down\n\nBelieve in me, I won't let you down\n\nNe-ver let you down\n\nLet you down, let you down\n\n\n\nCaught in chaos, I'm knee deep\n\nWrestling with all of my disbelief\n\nIn this moment, I hear You speak\n\nBreak through the noise and consume me!\n\nI change with the seasons, I lose sight of faith\n\nWhen my hope is gone, I know that You stay the same\n\nYour gentle whisper, a familiar sound\n\nI know You won't let me down...\n\n\n\nAll of this time and I've never let you down\n\n(I've never let you down)\n\nI carried you then, I'll carry you here and now\n\n(I'll carry you here and now)\n\nSo don't lose heart and don't forget\n\nMy work in you ain't finished yet\n\nHold on to me now, I'll never let you down\n\nI'll never let you down\n\n...\n\nI won't let you down\n\nBelieve in me, I won't let you down\n\nNe-ver let you down\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI won't let you down\n\nBelieve in me, I won't let you down\n\nNe-ver let you down\n\nI'll never let you down!\n\nI'll never let you down!\n\nI'll never let you down!!"
