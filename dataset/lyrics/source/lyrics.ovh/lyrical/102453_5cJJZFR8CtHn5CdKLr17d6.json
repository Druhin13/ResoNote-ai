  "lyrics": "Beware the night\r\nBeware the night before the dawn\r\nBeware the dark when light is gone\r\nFor there's a phantom lust awake\r\nThey wanna make you bend and scream\r\nThey wanna take your hand and lead\n\nYou in the light of Venus, girl\n\nCome let them take you for a ride\n\nForget the Lord and cross tonight\n\nAnd let your carnal lust prevail tonight\n\n\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons come at night and they bring the end\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons are a girl's best friend\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons come to life and they take command\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons are a girl's best friend\n\n\n\nBeware the fire\n\nBeware the fire in their eyes\n\nBeware of former driven lies\n\nFor there's a truth behind the veil\n\nThey make you part of blackened rites\n\nFor take the crave between your thighs\n\nYour antidote of evil, girl\n\nCome resurrect him to the sky\n\nAnd wave all innocence goodbye\n\nAnd let desire take command tonight\n\n\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons come at night and they bring the end\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons are a girl's best friend\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons come to life and they take command\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons are a girl's best friend\n\n\n\nAnd when your sleep is haunted in the night\n\nGirl don't you dare to seek for candlelight\n\n'Cause in the dark the demons come as carnal dynamite\n\n\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons of the night come and take her hand\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons are a girl's best friend\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons treat her thighs, come and make their stand\n\nWhoa-oh-oh, oh-oh\n\nDemons are a girl's best friend"
