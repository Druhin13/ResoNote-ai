  "lyrics": "This morning I woke up in a fortress of distortion\r\nI'm at war with my emotions, I'm at war with they enforcement\r\nTryna fight for what's right and got sidetracked\r\nWhere your mind at? Never mind that\r\nCan we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'\r\nYou win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon\n\nI stay with my brethren, I pay for protection\n\nMy prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions\n\nI wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?\n\nBut I'm ready and waitin'\n\nFor my day of salvation, and I'm patient\n\n\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nI’m coming home now\n\nI’m coming home\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nRight where I belong now\n\nRight where I belong\n\n\n\nThey're looking for saviors, I'm looking for safety\n\nThey never gon' break me, take me\n\nDown on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead\n\nYeah, I never say never, but I guarantee\n\nGather my strength, goin' hard in the paint\n\nPaint you a picture, it's put on display\n\nI'm gonna get, they don't give then I take\n\nCan't take me down now\n\nMy feet on the ground now\n\nFight 'til I'm down now\n\nSay it out loud now\n\nSay it out loud, are you ready for war?\n\n\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nI’m coming home now\n\nI’m coming home\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nRight where I belong now\n\nRight where I belong\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
