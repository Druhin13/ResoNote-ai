  "lyrics": "Tumbleweed, your inner spirit is a peace sign to me\r\nLife is full of little tricks and we can always pick up sticks\r\nAnd build again, that's what we do\r\nHarmony, the way we hold on when we tumble though the night\r\nLife is full of strange delights, in the darkness we find lights\n\nTo make our way, back home again\n\n\n\nTumbleweed, I'm baring my soul to you\n\nTumbleweed, it's all that I've got that's true\n\n\n\nBite me now, with your confusion, your happiness and delight\n\nIt will only hurt a moment, then it's gone and you can see\n\nThere's nothing left, to leave a mark\n\n\n\nAnimal, care for your kind, in the way you always do\n\nWhen the flower moon is shining, it's eclipse and your lips smiling\n\nComfort me and I comfort you\n\n\n\nTumbleweed, your inner spirit is a peace sign to me"
