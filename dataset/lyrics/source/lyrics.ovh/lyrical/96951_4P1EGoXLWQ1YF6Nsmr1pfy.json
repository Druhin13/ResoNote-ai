  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson You and I par LÉON\r\nSeeing the sun go down again\nStaying in my bed for too long now\nHeard you were out last night\nMy friends say you're looking well, you seem happy\nBut you’re a liar if you say that you're fine\nBet you wonder if I think of you now\nDone my best to stay away, but I think I'm going crazy\n\nYou and I\nYou don’t wanna talk about it\nYou don't wanna talk about\nYou and I\nWe don't ever talk about it\nBut in my head you say, say you still want it\n\nThat you're done with being lonely now\nIt's you and I\nYou and I\n\nStanding beneath the flickering lights\nWhen I shut my eyes you seem closer\nDancing to keep the tears away\nGet this heavy weight off my shoulder\nAnd every stranger, I pretend they are you\nThey'll never hold me, never touch me like you do\nDone my best to stay away\nBut I think I'm going crazy\nI'm going crazy\n\nYou and I\nYou don’t wanna talk about it\nYou don’t wanna talk about\nYou and I\n\nWe don't ever talk about it\nBut in my head oh you say, say you still want it\nThat you’re done with being lonely now\nIt's you and I\nYou and I\n\nI know you're out there somewhere, somewhere in the night\nFor a fleeting moment thought you passed me by\nSee the sun come up now, as it hits my eyes\nAll the things I wanna tell you, that you don't wanna talk about\n\nYou and I\nYou don’t wanna talk about it\nYou don't wanna talk about\nYou and I\nWe don't ever talk about it\n\nBut in my head oh you say, say you still want it\nThat you're done with being lonely now\nIt's you and I\nYou and I\n\nYou and I\nYou and I"
