  "lyrics": "The voice inside succeeds\r\nThe quiet whispers have now turned to violent screams\r\nSpoken in serpent tongues\r\nThe poison grips and rips the very air from my lungs\r\nFrom my lungs\n\nI can't get away (I can't get away)\n\nI can't get away\n\n\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n\n\nThere's no rest for the wicked now\n\nMy demons whisper to me, chain me to the ground\n\nBurning under the sun\n\nThe poison grips and rips the very air from my lungs\n\nFrom my lungs\n\n\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n(Giving in to this voice is a choice that I make)\n\nI'm digging graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n(Giving in to this voice is a choice that I make)\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n\n\nBuried in my body like a casket now\n\nI'll see you in the ground, see you in the ground\n\nBuried in my body like a casket now\n\nI'll see you in the ground, see you in the fucking ground\n\n\n\nI can't get away (I can't get away)\n\nI can't get away\n\n\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\nI'm digging graves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n(Giving in to this voice is a choice that I make)\n\nI'm digging graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n(I'll see you in the ground)\n\nSee you in the ground\n\nGraves, graves\n\nFor me and my friends\n\n(I'll see you in the ground)\n\nSee you in the ground"
