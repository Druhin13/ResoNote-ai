  "lyrics": "Our room is dark, the blinds are shut tight\r\nAnd everything is still too much outside\r\nIt may be over but not tonight\r\nI may be older but I still cry\r\nI can't stop sleeping in your clothes\n\nYou can't stop calling on the phone\n\n\n\nCan't you see I'm in recovery?\n\nJust let it be, I'm in recovery\n\n\n\nI'm holding on, I know I'm almost there\n\nSo don't reach out and tell me that you care\n\nI'm finally sober, I see the light\n\nThe worst is over, nobody died\n\n\n\nI'm still trying to let you go\n\nOh baby, please, leave me alone\n\n\n\nCan't you see I'm in recovery?\n\nJust let it be, I'm in recovery\n\nI know you wanna say you're sorry\n\nBut I don't wanna hear that story\n\nI don't wanna be your fool anymore\n\nCan't you see I'm in recovery?\n\n\n\nAlways thought you'd be the one\n\nWho always needed me\n\nMy home, you'd be my home\n\nSuddenly, your memory\n\nIn time is like an enemy, so cold\n\n\n\nCan't you see I'm in recovery?\n\nI know you wanna say you're sorry\n\nBut I already heard that story\n\nAnd I don't wanna be your fool anymore\n\n\n\nCan't you see I'm in recovery?"
