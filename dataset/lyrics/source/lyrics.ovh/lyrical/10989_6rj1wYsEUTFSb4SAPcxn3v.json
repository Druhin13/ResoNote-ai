(Now tell me) What did I do\n\nto deserve you (What did I do, babe) What did I say to make\n\nyour angel eyes turn my way (If only I had) If only I had\n\nthe world I?\n\nd give it all to you, babe (I?\n\nll be givin?\n\nit all you, girl) Now I?\n\nm about to leave for the road I?\n\nll take you with me in my heart And I really pray the Lord\n\nmy soul to keep And baby, just one request, keep me in your\n\ndream And I?\n\nm wondering, oh, sweet darlin? (Please tell me) What did I\n\ndo to deserve you (Ooh) What did I say to make your angel\n\neyes turn my way (What did I do, baby, oh) If only I had the\n\nworld I?\n\nd give it all to you, babe (I?\n\nll be givin?\n\nit all you) And I?\n\nm wondering, oh, sweet darlin? (What did I do) What did I do\n\nto deserve you (What did I say) What did I say to make your\n\nangel eyes turn my way (Ooh...\n\nooh...\n\nooh...\n\nooh...) If only I had the world I?\n\nd give it all to you, babe (I?\n\nll give you everything I got, baby) And I?\n\nm wondering, oh, sweet darlin? (Sweet darlin?, baby) What\n\ndid I do to deserve you (What did I do to deserve you) What\n\ndid I say to make your angel eyes turn my way (Ooh...\n\nooh...\n\nhoo...\n\nhoo...) If only I had the world I?\n\nd give it all to you, babe (Said I?\n\nm givin?\n\nit all to you, baby) Said I?\n\nm givin?\n\nit all to you, baby"
