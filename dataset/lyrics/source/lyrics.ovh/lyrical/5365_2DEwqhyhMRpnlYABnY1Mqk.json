  "lyrics": "Living's like a jigsaw\r\nAnd the farther in you go\r\nIf you're missing pieces\r\nNever really know\r\nWhen you're ticking like a timepiece\r\nOn which you can rely\n\nWonder why you wind it\n\nWhen you're running out of time\n\n\n\nSometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts\n\nNo one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart\n\nPick up all the pieces and go back to the start\n\nNever losing, only using all your moving parts\n\nAll your moving parts\n\n\n\nLiving's supposed to kill you\n\nBut it shouldn't feel like dying\n\nLoving's supposed to fill you\n\nBut it spills you like your wine\n\nAnd all the paper people\n\nWandering about\n\nWondering who made them\n\nAnd who's gonna cut them out\n\n\n\nSometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts\n\nNo one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart\n\nPick up all the pieces and go back to the start\n\nNever losing, only using all your moving parts\n\nAll your moving parts\n\n\n\nAnd even in the morning\n\nWhen the sun's behind the clouds\n\nIn the state you're born in\n\nIn the state that you're in now\n\nEven if the roof is leaking\n\nIt's still above your head\n\nJust remember two words that the two birds never said\n\n\n\nSometimes there's a danger of choking on the parts\n\nNo one gave a warning to the breaking of your heart\n\nPick up all the pieces and go back to the start\n\nNever losing, only using all your moving parts\n\nAll your moving parts"
