  "lyrics": "Where'd you go, left me here to pick up all this shit\r\nFuck you think, I got time that you don't got\r\nAnd where have you been, left me here to live with all this shit\r\nFuck you think, that I'll forget them fucked up things you did\r\nI need to know, where's the end\n\nLet's talk about things we both got in common\n\nTrying to find the place that we started\n\nFeels okay when I'm drunk and not bothered\n\nBut when the drink dries somehow I'm still drowning\n\nThe person looking at you in the mirror\n\nThat's the only one that got between us\n\n\n\nAnd I know, you've got some things you won't get off your chest\n\nSo, whiskey on my breath, I need some help\n\nI need to know, where's the end\n\n\n\nTalk of city dreams, small town in the rear view\n\nWe a team, it feels better when I'm near you\n\nMissing home, but when I'm there I still feel gone\n\nEven when I fix it I still feel wrong\n\nFinally got the time to get my money right\n\nI don't give a fuck, I'm getting back tonight\n\n\n\nWhere'd you go, left me here to pick up all this shit\n\nFuck you think, I got time that you don't got for me\n\nI need to know, where's the end\n\nAnd I know, you've got some things you won't get off your chest\n\nSo, whiskey on my breath, I need some help\n\nI need to know, where's the end\n\n\n\nLiquor in my cup, I've been drinking straight since 4 am last week\n\nAnd I know I got some issues baby\n\nI can't handle how you've made me, no\n\nI need to know, where's the end"
