  "lyrics": "You’re still there in the back of my mind\r\nIn that sunset together\r\nLooking back I see the warning signs\r\nCalling us now or never\r\nEvery movie makes love seem easy\r\nThey fall in love like the fire burns\n\nAnd maybe I’m the only one\n\nBut it feels like love is the hardest art to learn\n\nStepping into the neon sky\n\nCompass set on forever\n\nWe swim for shore in the bright red tide\n\nWith notes that time couldn’t sever\n\nEvery movie makes love seem easy\n\nThey fall in love like the fire burns\n\nAnd maybe I’m the only one\n\nBut it feels like love is the hardest art to learn\n\nLove is\n\nSurrender is\n\nLove is\n\nSurrender is\n\nLove is the hardest art\n\nThe hardest art to learn"
