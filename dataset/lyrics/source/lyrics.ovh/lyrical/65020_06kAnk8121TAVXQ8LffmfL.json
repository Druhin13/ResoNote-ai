  "lyrics": "To all those who acquiesced these scars\r\nJust because they loved the person holding the knife:\r\nIt's getting-even time... for those I love, I'll sacrifice...\r\nAnd I'll slit their throats with the knife they left in my back\r\nSome say time heals\n\nBut I'm pretty sure that's a lie\n\nWhat they really mean\n\nIs that you will eventually get used to the void\n\nYou will simply forget\n\nWho you were without it\n\nYou'll forget what you looked like\n\nWithout all these scars\n\n\n\nYou look like a winter night\n\nMy scars hold your dreams\n\nI could sleep inside the cold of you\n\nThe hole in your heart that won't close\n\n\n\nYour breath resembles the kiss of death\n\nCausing my thirst, holding these scars\n\nTogether we drank merely gangrene\n\nAlthough without hesitation... down in one...\n\n\n\nYou see, love could be labeled poison\n\nFuck it... we would drink it anyway\n\nNow this river will cleanse away our traces\n\nMay the bridges I burn light your way\n\n\n\nOnly the injured truly understand the wounded\n\nEverything I touch turns into quicksand anyway\n\nSadly this life is my noose... please hang me higher\n\nI am this grave with a view... the so-called void...\n\n\n\nSo why do you trouble yourself, my heart?\n\nMaybe this wayfare will kill us\n\nBut weren't we dying anyway?\n\n\n\nWeren't we dying anyway?\n\n\n\n'Cause only the injured can truly understand the wounded\n\nWhen everything they touch turns into quicksand\n\nSadly this life is their noose, come on hang them higher\n\nWe are this grave with a view... we are... this void...\n\n\n\nThousand miles down the river, thousand winters upstream\n\nWhat were we expecting, what did we bide to signify?\n\nYou may have been here, but you left the place very early\n\nSo let me go, let me leave! I never meant to stay anyway..."
