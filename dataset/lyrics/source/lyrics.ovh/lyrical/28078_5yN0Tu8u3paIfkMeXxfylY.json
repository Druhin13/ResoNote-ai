  "lyrics": "You're the beauty, the stranger in the grocery store\r\nYou're the highest quality hardwood door\r\nYou're the final wartime piece of bread\r\nYou once told me that you hate the shaven head\r\nI want you so\n\nAnd God must be the greatest comedian I know\n\nTo put you so far away\n\nHe put you so far away\n\n\n\nThere are \"Davids\" and \"Janets\" everywhere\n\nThere are juveniles with the blondest hair\n\nThere are cronies with their jobs and ties and cash\n\nThere are people like me - the whitest trash\n\n\n\nI want you so\n\nAnd God must be the greatest comedian I know\n\nTo put you so far away\n\nHe put you so far away\n\n\n\nI have heard\n\nThat Jesus was a very handsome girl\n\nIf she were\n\nI'd bet she'd look something like you now\n\nI have heard\n\nThat some people feel the Earth is flat\n\nBut if it were\n\nHow come I don't see you anywhere\n\nHow come I don't see you any...\n\n\n\nI want you so\n\nAnd God must be the greatest comedian I know\n\nTo put you so far away\n\nHe put you so far away\n\nI want you so\n\nAnd God must be the greatest comedian I know\n\nTo put you so far away\n\nHe put you so far away"
