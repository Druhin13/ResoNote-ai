  "lyrics": "I woke up it was 7 \nWaited till 11 \njust to figure out that no one would call \nI think i got a lot of friends but I don't hear from them \nWhat's another night all alone? \nWhen your spending everyday on you own \n\nand here it goes \n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI'm just a kid and life is a nightmare \n\nI'm just a kid, I know that its not fair \n\nNobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is \n\nhaving more fun than me \n\n\n\nAnd maybe when the night is dead, I'll crawl into my bed \n\nStaring at these 4 walls again \n\nI'll try to think about the last time, I had a good time \n\nEveryone's got somewhere to go \n\nAnd their gonna leave me here on my own and here it goes\n\n\n\nI'm just a kid and life is a nightmare \n\nI'm just a kid, I know that its not fair \n\nNobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is \n\nhaving more fun than me \n\n\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with me? \n\ndon't fit in with anybody \n\nHow did this happen to me? \n\nWide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep \n\nand every night is the worst night ever \n\n\n\nI'm just a kid [repeat x5]\n\n\n\nI'm just a kid and life is a nightmare \n\nI'm just a kid, I know that its not fair \n\nNobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is nobody wants to be alone in the world. \n\n\n\n\n\nI'm just a kid and life is a nightmare \n\nI'm just a kid, I know that its not fair \n\nNobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is nobody wants to be alone in the world\n\nNobody cares, cause I'm alone and the world is\n\nhaving more fun than me.\n\n\n\nTonight.\n\n\n\nI'm all alone tonight \n\nNobody cares tonight \n\nCause im just a kid tonight"
