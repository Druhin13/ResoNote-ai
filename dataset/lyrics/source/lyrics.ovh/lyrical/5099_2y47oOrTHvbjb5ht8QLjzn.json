  "lyrics": "I spent last summer falling apart\r\nI left the windows open and the rain did fall\r\nI slept with the lights on in my clothes\r\nI blurred lines like a picture that's overexposed\r\nSaw myself in the mirror and I froze\n\nWhy can't we just hold on\n\nAnd on and on and on\n\nIn a moment now you're gone\n\nAnd you're not coming back to me\n\nYou're not coming back to me\n\n\n\nYou're voice rang like an echo in the night\n\nIn the sky like a long lost satellite\n\nDon't let these days ever die\n\nYou're voice rang like an echo in the night\n\nIn the sky like a long lost satellite\n\nDon't let these days ever die\n\n\n\nI spent the weekend sleeping in my car\n\nBurning bridges, I went way too far\n\nI looked death in the eyes and I got too close\n\nI saw the sunrise breaking over the coast\n\nPushed myself to the limit and didn't explode\n\n\n\nWhy can't we just hold on\n\nAnd on and on and on\n\nIn a moment now you're gone\n\nAnd you're not coming back to me\n\nYou're not coming back to me\n\n\n\nYou're voice rang like an echo in the night\n\nIn the sky like a long lost satellite\n\nDon't let these days ever die\n\nYou're voice rang like an echo in the night\n\nIn the sky like a long lost satellite\n\nDon't let these days ever die\n\n\n\nI opened up like the sky\n\nBefore it got too dark\n\nMy heart sank like the sun [?]\n\nDon't let these days ever die\n\nThe secret spot where we parked\n\nI reveal my scars\n\n[?] so fast\n\nWe could reach the stars\n\n\n\nYou're voice rang like an echo in the night\n\nIn the sky like a long lost satellite\n\nDon't let these days ever die\n\nYou're voice rang like an echo in the night\n\nIn the sky like a long lost satellite\n\nDon't let these days ever die"
