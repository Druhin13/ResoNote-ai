  "lyrics": "So kill me now\r\nAll the times we bled, all the ones we left too long\r\nWhat’s done is done\r\nThere’s a price we paid, and a time we die alone\r\nI want something better than nothing\n\nSomething’s better than nothing\n\n\n\nHold on the first one to let go\n\nWhere’s the burden that breaks us all?\n\nSo breathe in\n\nFor the ones we lost\n\nWe hold our own, we hold our own\n\n\n\nSo here we are\n\nFrom the darkest days, to the comfort of the sun\n\nThe silver tongues\n\nAll the lies we tell ourselves, in the end we’re wrong\n\n\n\nI want something better than nothing\n\nSomething’s better than nothing\n\n\n\nHold on the first one to let go\n\nWhere’s the burden that breaks us all?\n\nSo breathe in\n\nFor the ones we lost\n\nWe hold our own, we hold our own\n\n\n\nSuch a long way home\n\nAnd you’re not gonna take me\n\nAnd if all hope’s gone\n\nI’ll carry the burden home\n\n\n\nHold on the first one to let go\n\nWhere’s the burden that breaks us all?\n\nSo breathe in\n\nFor the ones we lost\n\nWe hold our own, we hold our own"
