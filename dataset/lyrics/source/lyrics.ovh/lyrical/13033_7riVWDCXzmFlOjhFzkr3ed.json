  "lyrics": "In heavy air I feel it creep\r\nAnd our eyes can't meet\r\nA poison word that you chose\r\nAnd the distance grows\r\nAnd I don't wanna cry no more\r\nAnd I don't wanna die a little more\n\nEvery day\n\nAnd I don't wanna cry no more\n\nAnd I don't wanna cry a little more\n\nEvery day\n\nTo pull yourself from harm\n\nTo be the braver one\n\nTo raise a weary hand\n\nIn a house that's built on sand\n\nTo wear it like a crown\n\nTo kick before you drown\n\nTo fight it and to cry no more\n\nWill I be the warrior?\n\nOr will the axe shine clean?\n\nSteely eyed, your blood'll burn\n\nI will save our lives\n\nAnd I don't wanna cry no more\n\nAnd I don't wanna die a little more\n\nEvery day\n\nAnd I don't wanna cry no more\n\nAnd I don't wanna cry a little more\n\nEvery day\n\nTo pull yourself from harm\n\nTo be the braver one\n\nTo raise a weary hand\n\nIn a house that's built on sand\n\nTo wear it like a crown\n\nTo kick before you drown\n\nTo fight it and to cry no more\n\nCry no more\n\nI don't wanna die a little more\n\nEvery day\n\nI don't wanna cry no more\n\nI don't wanna die a little more\n\nEvery day"
