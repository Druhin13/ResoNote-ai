  "lyrics": "I didn't mean to hurt you when I hurt myself\r\nIt's just an empty voice screaming out for help\r\nNo, I didn't mean to scare you\r\nBut I couldn't see\r\nThat when I went to hell I was taking you with me\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nI'm climbing in the dark\n\nTrying not to fall apart\n\nSometimes I get so high\n\nFalling is the only out I see\n\nAnd I don't wanna take you down with me\n\n\n\nYeah I'm loving my out\n\nAnd you're loving my out\n\nTake you down\n\nTake you down with me\n\n(Down with me, down)\n\n(Down with me, down)\n\n(Take you) down with me\n\n\n\nDown, you're down with me\n\nDown, you're down with me\n\n\n\n(Yeah I'm loving my out)\n\n(And you're loving my out)\n\n(Take you down)\n\n\n\nThis life is like a razor\n\nWhen it cuts I bleed\n\nBut it's in my hand\n\nAnd I'm doing it to me\n\nSometimes it's like an ocean\n\nAnd it gets too deep\n\nAnd there's no way that now you could rescue me\n\n\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nI'm fighting in the dark\n\nTrying not to break your heart\n\nSometimes I get so high\n\nFalling is the only out I see\n\nAnd I don't wanna take you down with me\n\n\n\nYou need to let it go now\n\nBefore you drown\n\nI know that you won't understand\n\nBut you need to let go of these hands\n\n'Cause I'm going down\n\nAnd I don't wanna take you down with me\n\n\n\nAnd I don't wanna take you down with me\n\nTake you down, down with me"
