  "lyrics": "Hello, this is the manager\r\nAnybody there, open up\r\nI got a three day notice\r\nTo pay your rent or quit\r\nHello, damnit I know you in there\r\nI can hear the television going\n\n\n\nYou know, if you would have done\n\nWhat I told you to do the first time\n\nTake a five minute break, go back to work\n\nAnd bust it out, you'll get out early\n\nBut you don't wanna do that\n\nAll you do is just sit here\n\nAnd then you complain afterwards\n\nI don't wanna hear any more from you\n\nYou're fired\n\n\n\nYeah, we're calling about your car payment\n\nOk, I've heard all the excuses\n\nI give you a call every week\n\nAnd you seem to not wanna come in\n\nAnd pay your payment, I don't understand\n\nYou drive around in the car\n\nBut you can't pay for it, give it back\n\nYou better not sleep tonight\n\nCause you'll wake up and your car will be gone\n\n\n\nI'm not giving you the money, don't ask\n\nDon't go to your dad and don't call your grandmother\n\nYou're not my little boy anymore\n\n\n\nFine, I'll tape the notice to your door\n\nAnd if you don't pay your rent in three days or quit\n\nWhat the hell is going on up in here\n\nYou a grown ass man, pay your rent or quit\n\nBut I'm tired of knocking on your door\n\nI'm a have to beat it down or break it down\n\nPay or quit, make a decision now"
