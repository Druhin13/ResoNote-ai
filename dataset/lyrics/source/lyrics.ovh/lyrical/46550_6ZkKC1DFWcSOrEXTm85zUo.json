  "lyrics": "It's always the same\r\nTears for a time we can never regain\r\nAs life drifts away\r\nWe search for the reasons we can't make it stay\r\nWe walk in a shadowland\r\nTurning to dust, blown away in the wind\n\nOne last soul to save\n\nThat hangs from a thread off the end of a dream\n\n\n\nBut you jumped the great divide\n\nSo we'll meet you on the other side\n\n\n\nIt's always the same\n\nMourn for a life we can never reclaim\n\nAs time drifts away\n\nWe search for the reasons we can't make it stay\n\nAlone in a shadowland\n\nTurning to dust, blown away like the sand\n\nOne last soul to save\n\nThat hangs off a dream at the end of a thread\n\n\n\nBut you jumped the great divide\n\nSo we'll meet you on the other side\n\nWe'll jump the great divide\n\nAnd you'll greet us on the other side\n\nOn the other side\n\n\n\nOn the other side\n\n\n\nBut you jumped the great divide\n\nSo we'll meet you on the other side\n\nWe'll jump the great divide\n\nAnd you'll greet us on the other side\n\nOn the other side\n\n\n\nOn the other side\n\nWe'll jump the great divide"
