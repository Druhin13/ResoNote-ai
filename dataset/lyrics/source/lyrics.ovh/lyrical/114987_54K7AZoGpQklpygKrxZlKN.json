  "lyrics": "This mornin' I got up at 6:01\r\nI walked out and saw the rising sun\r\nAnd I drank it in like whiskey\r\nI saw a tree I've seen a thousand times\r\nA bird on a branch and I watched it fly away in the wind\r\nAnd it hit me\n\nIt's a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear\n\n\n\nSome days you just breath in\n\nJust try to break even\n\nSometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest\n\nSometimes it's just beatin'\n\nSome days you just forget\n\nWhat all you've been given\n\nSome days you just get back\n\nAnd some days you're just alive\n\nSome days you're livin'\n\nSome days you're livin'\n\n\n\nI went back in and fired the coffee up\n\nShe walked in the kitchen like she always does\n\nIn my t-shirt and it killed me\n\nAnd I kissed her like it was the first time\n\nShe laughed and looked at me like I'd lost my mind\n\nI said \"Baby, I love you, can't live without you, I know I don't say it enough\"\n\n\n\nSome days you just breath in\n\nJust try to break even\n\nSometimes your heart's poundin' out of your chest\n\nSometimes it's just beatin'\n\nSome days you just forget\n\nWhat all you've been given\n\nSome days you just get back\n\nAnd some days you're just alive\n\nSome days you're livin'\n\nSome days you're livin'\n\n\n\nLike you never die\n\nBlue's a little bluer up in the sky\n\nYou're high's a little high\n\nYou feel that fire you've been missing\n\nSome days you're living\n\n\n\nIt'a beautiful world sometimes I don't see so clear\n\n\n\nSome days you start singin'\n\nAnd you don't need a reason\n\nSometimes the world's just right\n\nYour clear eyes ain't even blinkin'\n\nGot a heart full of grateful\n\nFor all you've been given\n\nSome days you just get by\n\nYeah some days you're just alive\n\nSome days you're livin'\n\nSome days you're livin'\n\n\n\nLivin' like you'll never die\n\nBlue's a little bluer up in the sky\n\nYou're high's a little high\n\nYou feel that fire you've been missin'\n\nSome days you're living\n\nSome days you're living"
