  "lyrics": "Not everybody drinks on a Tuesday night\r\nMixes their liquor with Crystal Light\r\nWith a couple of friends they called out of the blue\r\nAnd not everybody spends what they made that week\r\nOn a tank of gas and a little bit of weed\r\nBut all my favorite people do\n\n\n\nI don't know about them, but I know about us\n\nIt is what it is and we love who we love\n\nNot everybody gets what we’re going through\n\nBut all my favorite people do\n\nYeah, all my favorite people do\n\n\n\nCome on, TJ\n\n\n\nNot everybody's gonna find clarity\n\nIn a back porch sittin' kind of therapy\n\nWith a little bit of wine, John Prine, and Camel Blues\n\nNot everybody leaves well enough alone\n\nStays out of business that ain’t their own\n\nBut all my favorite people do\n\n\n\nI don't know about them, but I know about us\n\nIt is what it is and we love who we love\n\nNot everybody gets what we're going through\n\nBut all my favorite people do\n\nYeah, all my favorite people do\n\n\n\nAll my favorite people, all my favorite people\n\nAll my favorite people, yeah, they do\n\nYeah, we ain't all perfect, but we're doing alright\n\nEverybody's worried 'bout tryin' to get by\n\nBut all my favorite people do\n\n\n\nWell, I don’t know about them, but I know about us\n\nIt is what it is and we love who we love\n\nNot everybody gets what we’re going through\n\nBut all my favorite people do\n\nYeah, all my favorite people do"
