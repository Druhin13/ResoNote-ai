  "lyrics": "Guess I was born this way\r\nA young gun with something to say\r\nShow me the goal to take\r\nI wanted a name\r\nTell me this is the way\n\nI'll break any neck to play\n\nI'll fake any smile and sign it away\n\nI wanted a name\n\n\n\nAnd I feel like the moment\n\nAnd pretend that I own it\n\nAnd I know that I chose this\n\nAnd I want it\n\n\n\nThis road isn't homely\n\nI got ten thousands onlys\n\nBut it only takes one of them to hold me\n\n\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\n\n\nCuz I still needed you\n\nI needed you\n\nCuz I still need you\n\n\n\nTell me this is the way\n\nAnd now that I learn it's a game\n\nI'll take all the blame and keep all the shame\n\nAnd tell you it's fame\n\n\n\nNow that I'm on my way\n\nAnd nothing is ever the same\n\nI've never been good with the change\n\nI wanted a name\n\n\n\nAnd I feel like the moment\n\nAnd pretend that I own it\n\nAnd I know that I chose this\n\nAnd I want it\n\n\n\nThis road isn't homely\n\nI got ten thousands onlys\n\nBut it only takes one of them to hold me\n\n\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\nCould you love me like you used to?\n\n\n\nCuz I still needed you\n\nI needed you\n\nI needed you\n\nI needed you\n\nCuz I still need you"
