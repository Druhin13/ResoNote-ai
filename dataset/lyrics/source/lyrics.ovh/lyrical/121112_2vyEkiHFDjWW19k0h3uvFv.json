What to do next? I don't care\n\nEvery single day feelin' like I'm on a mission\n\nWorkin' with Pharrell on my first damn session\n\nNever had to write in a room with nobody\n\nFeelin' under pressure, man this dude made \"Happy\"\n\nWrote a couple bars while chuggin' on a Red Bull\n\nThen all of the sudden, all my work is turned to papers ayy\n\n\n\nFlyin' 20 hours never felt so right\n\nThey say I get better as the days go by\n\nI'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by\n\nGettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white\n\nFlyin' 20 hours never felt so right\n\nThey say I get better as the days go by\n\nI'm just tryna be the goat, used to see them walk by\n\nGettin' ready for this life, all I see is red and white"
