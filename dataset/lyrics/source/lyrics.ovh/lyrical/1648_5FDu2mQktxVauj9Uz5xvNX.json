  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Real Until The End (Interlude) par Ace Hood\r\nAy\nAin't my first impression ay\nIn God we trust\n\nRolling on woods\nSmokin' on good\nFuck nigga free\nI'm feeling real good\nI'm playin' in a Benzo\nTints on the window\nDon't like the bando\nI'm low like the ammo\nI'm usually the life of the party\nI'm sippin' on brown with a barbie\nNigga kush get louder than Cardi\nYou would think I was king to the mollies\n\nAll about that bag\nGotta feed my kids\nGotta build that bridge\nGotta fill my fridge\nGotta feel my glow\nEverything must go\nWhen they gettin' too gassed\nI'ma switch my MO\nNever make full stops at a red light\nLast thing that they seen was a bright light\nI'm in love with the club and the night life\nSports centre, checkin in on the highlights\nYoung nigga gon' ball\nAntonio Brown\nA rappin' hood nation\nI'm holding that down\nI'm living my life to the full\nLiving my life to the full\n\nAll that hating\nI'ma use it all as the fuel\nI'ma use it all as the fuel\nShow up in the vert\nGotta go and touch that turf\nGotta go and make my worth\nFirst to the first\nQueen keep a thing in her purse\nAin't have to say it in the verse\nWay a nigga work\nI don't need xanax to perk\nAin't tryna cope with a curse\nReal to the end of the earth\nReal to the end of the earth, ay\nReal to the end of the earth\nReal to the end of the earth, ay"
