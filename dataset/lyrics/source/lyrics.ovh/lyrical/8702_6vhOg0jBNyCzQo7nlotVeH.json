  "lyrics": "They tell me, it's all in my mind\r\nThey don't know they're yet to try\r\nMy thoughts are safer inside\r\nI pray it hurts less this time\r\nThey tell me, it's all in my head\n\nThey don't know they have to check\n\nWhat lies within is a mess\n\nThis pill could fix it, I guess\n\n\n\nDon't say, it's all in my brain\n\n'Cause I can't help being this way\n\nI feel the changes they've made\n\nNow I don't feel the same\n\n\n\nLeave my secrets alone\n\nThey aren't for you to know\n\nI hear the knock at my door\n\nAs they take me far from my home\n\nThey say, \"It's better this way\"\n\nBut the voices, they tell me I'm sane\n\nThey think they're cleansing my veins\n\nAs they hook me up in this place\n\n\n\nThey say it starts in my soul\n\nMakes its way down through my blood\n\nIt's been with me since I was young\n\nBut they can't explain what it's from\n\n\n\nI think that I've had enough\n\nI don't know who I can trust\n\n\n\nLeave my secrets alone\n\nThey aren't for you to know\n\nI hear the knock at my door\n\nAs they take me far from my home\n\nThey say, \"It's better this way\"\n\nBut the voices, they tell me I'm sane\n\nThey think they're cleansing my veins\n\nAs they hook me up in this place\n\n\n\nLeave my secrets alone\n\nThey aren't for you to know\n\nI hear the knock at my door\n\nAs they make me vacate my home"
