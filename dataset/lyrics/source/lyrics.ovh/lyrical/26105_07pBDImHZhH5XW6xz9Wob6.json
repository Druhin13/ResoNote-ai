  "lyrics": "Well I've been called Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden\r\nBut what about Jesus in case you've forgotten\r\nThis country we love was built on the good book\r\nSo don't go blaming JC if your preacher's a crook\r\nAll my brothers with beards, raise up your beers\n\nLet that thing grow out from ear to ear\n\nIf you can't see my dimples, I'm so sorry dear\n\nThis ain't no shave November, it's no shaving this year\n\n\n\nMaxed out IRA's and 401k's\n\nWith the money I've saved on my three razor blades\n\nGonna get me a Harley, beard blowin' in the wind\n\nQuite legendary like old Abe Lincoln\n\nWe got a name for folks without beards\n\nThey call them women around here\n\n\n\nAll my brothers with beards raise up your beers\n\nLet that thing grow out from ear to ear\n\nThey say you're so cute clean shaven, I'm so sorry dear\n\nThis ain't no shave November, it's no shaving this year\n\n\n\nI ain't no Bocephus or David Allan Coe\n\nI ain't no great singer, I was the first one to know\n\nBut when I'm on stage singin' my song\n\nAll the girls rush the front row 'cause my beard is so long\n\n\n\nAll my brothers with beards raise up your beers\n\nLet that thing grow out from ear to ear\n\nIf you can't see my dimples, I'm so sorry dear\n\nThis ain't no shave November, it's no shaving this year\n\n\n\nAll my brothers with beards raise up your beers\n\nLet that thing grow out from ear to ear\n\nThey say you're so cute clean shaven, I'm so sorry dear\n\nThis ain't no shave November, it's no shaving this year"
