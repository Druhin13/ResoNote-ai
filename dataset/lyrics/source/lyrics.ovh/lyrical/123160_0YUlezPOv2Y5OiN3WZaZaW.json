  "lyrics": "My feet are sore from walking all night long\r\nNo direction when there's nowhere to go\r\nEmpty picture frames of times all gone\r\nLonely echoes of the stories we‘ve told\r\nIf you put on my shoes walk a mile or two\n\n‘til your eyes open wider than they used to\n\nThen I will meet you there where the air is clear\n\nPinky swear I’ll meet you there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll stay, with you I see new colors\n\nAnd I'll stay, today until forever\n\nAnd I’ll stay, with you I see new colors\n\nMy eyes are open wider today until forever\n\nI'll stay with you\n\n\n\nFamiliar faces as we chase the moon\n\nFall in love and I'll come crying to you\n\nThrough the changes and the Earth's bad moods\n\nI'll lay my troubled bones on you\n\n\n\nIf you put on my shoes walk a mile or two\n\n‘til your eyes open wider than they used to\n\nThen I will meet you there where the air is clear\n\nPinky swear I'll meet you there\n\n\n\nAnd I'll stay, with you I see new colors\n\nAnd I'll stay, today until forever\n\nAnd I’ll stay, with you I see new colors\n\nMy eyes are open wider today until forever\n\nI’ll stay with you\n\n\n\n(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)\n\nI'll stay with you\n\n(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)\n\n\n\nAnd I’ll stay, with you I see new colors\n\nAnd I'll stay, today until forever\n\nAnd I'll stay, with you I see new colors\n\nMy eyes are open wider today until forever\n\n\n\n(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)\n\nI'll stay with you\n\n(Ah, ah aaah, aaaah)\n\nOooh woah woah woah\n\nMy eyes are open wider\n\nTonight\n\n\n\nWhen I’m a hundred two , and I can't sing to you\n\nClose your eyes, memorize how I used to"
