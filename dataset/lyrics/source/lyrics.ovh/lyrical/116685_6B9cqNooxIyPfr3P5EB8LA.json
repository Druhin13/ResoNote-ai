  "lyrics": "It's not what you said, it's how you said it\r\nAnd don't you say you love me when you know you'll regret it\r\nIt's not what we did, it's what we didn't\r\nWe've been losing time and don't know how to admit it\r\nWhen love don't feel right\n\nWe get along, get along on the outside\n\nHead out the door, but our hearts on the inside\n\nLove don't feel right\n\nWe get along, get along on the outside\n\nBut hearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie\n\n\n\nWe're half of the same\n\nDon't take that the wrong way\n\nYou know what I mean\n\nHearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie\n\nWon't do this again\n\nDon't take that the wrong way\n\nYou know what I mean\n\nHearts ain't gonna, hearts ain't gonna lie\n\n\n\nYou were the one, the one that I wanted\n\nBut you know people change, we're not the same as we started\n\nWe're not running away, we're moving forward\n\nAnd though we're trying to stay ahead, we're just treading water"
