  "lyrics": "I need a sign to let me know you're here\r\nAll of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere\r\nI need to know that things are gonna look up\r\n'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup \nWhen there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head\n\nWhen you feel the world shake from the words that are said \n\n\n\nI need a sign to let me know you're here\n\n'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear\n\nI want a reason for the way things have to be\n\nI need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me \n\n\n\nAnd I'm calling all angels\n\nI'm calling all you angels \n\n\n\nWhen children have to play inside so they don't disappear\n\nAnd private eyes solve marriage lies cause we don't talk for years\n\nAnd football teams are kissing Queens\n\nand losing sight of having dreams\n\nIn a world that what we want is only what we want until it's ours\n\n\n\nI'm calling all angels\n\nI'm calling all you angels"
