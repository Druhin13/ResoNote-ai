  "lyrics": "Every day I sit with you talking about nothing\r\nWatch the game and watch it for you your team\r\nLaughs at all your jokes even when there not funny\r\nCause all I want to know is that you care\r\nAnd he can’t seem to take his armor off\n\nAnd he’s fighting against his own self\n\nWhat do I do? What if I lose this game of tug of war?\n\n\n\nAll I want to know is how you feel when you’re with her\n\nWhen she cracks a smile does it light up your world?\n\nHow do you feel when it’s all said and done?\n\nAre you in love with her even though you can’t see?\n\nHow do you feel?\n\nHow do you feel?\n\n\n\nI don’t need your name I don’t want your money\n\nAll I want to be is part of your dreams\n\nI don’t need no extra all I want is love\n\nPlease open up and listen to me\n\n\n\nAnd he can’t seem to take his armor off\n\nAnd he’s fighting against his own self\n\nWhat do I do? In this game of tug of war \n\n\n\nAll (long) I want to know is how you feel when you’re with her\n\nWhen she cracks a smile does it light up your world?\n\nHow do you feel when it’s all said and done?\n\nAre you in love with her even though you can’t see?\n\nHow do you feel (Oh Ahhh) \n\n\n\nHow do you feel? When you’re with her \n\nHow you do feel? (Ahhh) (Uhhh Uahhh)\n\nAll I wanna know is how you feel when you’re with her \n\nWhen she cracks a smile does it light up your world?\n\nHow do you feel when it’s all said and done?\n\nAre you in love with her even though you can’t see?\n\nHow do you feel (Oh Ahh) how do you feel?\n\n\n\n(Oh Oh Oh My)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Dank an warren für den Text)"
