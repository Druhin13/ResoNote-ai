  "lyrics": "You and me we made a vow\r\nFor better or for worse\r\nI can't believe you let me down\r\nBut the proof is in the way it hurts\r\nFor months on end I've had my doubts\n\nDenying every tear\n\nI wish this would be over now\n\nBut I know that I still need you here\n\n\n\nYou say I'm crazy\n\nCause you don't think I know what you've done\n\nBut when you call me baby\n\nI know I'm not the only one\n\n\n\nYou've been so unavailable\n\nNow sadly I know why\n\nYour heart is unobtainable\n\nEven though Lord knows you kept mine\n\n\n\nYou say I'm crazy\n\nCause you don't think I know what you've done\n\nBut when you call me baby\n\nI know I'm not the only one\n\n\n\nI have loved you for many years\n\nMaybe I am just not enough\n\nYou've made me realise my deepest fear\n\nBy lying and tearing us up\n\n\n\nYou say I'm crazy\n\nCause you don't think I know what you've done\n\nBut when you call me baby\n\nI know I'm not the only one\n\n\n\nYou say I'm crazy\n\nCause you don't think I know what you've done\n\nBut when you call me baby\n\nI know I'm not the only one\n\nI know I'm not the only one\n\nI know I'm not the only one\n\nAnd I know.And I know.And I know.And I know.And I know...\n\nI know I'm not the only one"
