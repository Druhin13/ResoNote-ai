  "lyrics": "If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier\r\nShe left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear\r\nSay for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow\r\nShe might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.\r\nWe had a falling-out, like lovers often will\n\nAnd to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill\n\nAnd though our separation, it pierced me to the heart\n\nShe still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.\n\n\n\nIf you get close to her, kiss her once for me\n\nI always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free\n\nOh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way\n\nThough the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.\n\n\n\nI see a lot of people as I make the rounds\n\nAnd I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town\n\nAnd I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off\n\nEither I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.\n\n\n\nSundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\n\nI know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\n\nIf she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find\n\nTell her she can look me up if she's got the time."
