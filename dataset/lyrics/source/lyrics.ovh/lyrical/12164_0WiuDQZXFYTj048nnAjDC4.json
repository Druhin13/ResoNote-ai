  "lyrics": "I really thought you'd be home by now\r\nI guess I was wrong again\r\nI used to think I could go somewhere\r\nIt turns out I'm ill prepared\r\nI kiss the bend of the canyon road\n\nWhere I find your ghost again\n\nHere, you found the sky\n\nThrough the moon roof, topless\n\nYou were so happy then\n\n\n\nI'm right, I'm wrong\n\nI'm everything but sure\n\nMy blazing head, my freezing heart\n\nYour five words walk out the door\n\n\n\nWould you run after me?\n\nI feel I've stood here once before\n\nWould you run after me?\n\nWould you run, or do we\n\nDisappear here\n\n\n\nNow you say\n\n\"I see your face, every turn I make\n\nI find no comfort there\"\n\nI add\n\n\"I hear your voice with every mistake\n\nIt's like you're always here\"\n\n\n\nI'm right, I'm wrong\n\nI'm everything but sure\n\nSo we fight\n\nUntil dawn\n\nWhen five words walk out the door\n\n\n\nWould you run after me?\n\nI feel I've stood here once before\n\nWould you run after me?\n\nWould you run, or do we\n\nDisappear here\n\n\n\nGo, go\n\nNo, stay\n\nNo, go, go\n\nNo, stay\n\nNo, go, go\n\nNo, stay\n\nNo, go, go, go\n\n\n\nWould you run after me?\n\nI feel I've stood here once before\n\nWould you run after me?\n\n\n\nDisappear here"
