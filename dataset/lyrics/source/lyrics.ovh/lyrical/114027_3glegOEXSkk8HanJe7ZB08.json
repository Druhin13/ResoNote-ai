  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Up&Up par Coldplay\r\nFixing up a car to drive in it again\nSearching for the water, hoping for the rain\nUp and up\nUp and up\n\nDown upon a canvas, working with a wheel\nWaiting for a chance to pick your orange peel\nUp and up\nUp and up\n\nSee a performer, a diamond in the rough\nSee a bird soaring high above the flood\nIt's in your blood, It's in your blood\n\nUnderneath the storm an umbrella is saying\nSitting with the boys takes away the pain\n\nUp and up\nUp and up\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and fly\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and up\n\nLying in the gutter, aiming for the moon\nTrying to empty out the ocean with a spoon\nUp and up\nUp and up\n\n\nHow can people suffer? How can people part?\nHow can people struggle? How can people\nBreak your heart?\nBreak your heart?\n\nYes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel\nYes I wanna know, show me how to\nHeal it up, heal it up\n\nSee the forest staring at every seed\nAngels in the marble waiting to be freed\nJust need love, Just need love\nWhen the going is rough, saying\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and fly\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and go\n\nYou can say what it is, or fight for it\nClose your mind and take the risk\nYou can say [?] and clench your fist\nAnd see each [?] as a gift\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and fly\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\n\nI know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know we're gonna get it, get it together somehow\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and fly\n\nWe're gonna get it, get it together\nI know, we're gonna get it, get it together and float\nWe're gonna get it, get it together and go\nUp, and up, and up\n\nFixing up a car to drive in it again\nWhen you're in pain, when you think you've had enough\n\nDon't ever give up\nDon't ever give up\n\nBelieve in love"
