  "lyrics": "Somebody told me God is simply what we don't know\r\nSaw a butterfly, it was dead, but it was gorgeous\r\nAnd all the robots are just walkin' down the sidewalk\r\nKings and their little empires that they made up\r\nAnd I'm wide open\n\nAnd I'm wide open\n\n\n\nDusty got shot, and then Osha got married\n\nStewie still dead, and commitment still scary\n\nI got a new woman, but I treat her like my old one\n\nIf I keep this shit up, I know I'ma be with no one\n\n\n\nAnd I'm wide open\n\nYeah, I'm wide open"
