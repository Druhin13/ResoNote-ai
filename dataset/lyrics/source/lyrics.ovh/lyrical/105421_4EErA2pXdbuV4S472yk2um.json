  "lyrics": "White kids don't dance\r\nThey just follow commands\r\nPut your right foot in\r\nLeave your heart in your hand\r\nAnd spin like the record\r\nI was making for you\n\nYou promised us forever\n\nNow I'm spinning alone, it's true\n\n\n\nBut Bigfoot is out there just knowing you don't care\n\nAbout his life in solitude\n\nHe's dancing with the lonely, he'd choose you only\n\nHe'd rock from side to side\n\n\n\nAnd your life will change straight out of the blue\n\nThe clouds in your mind, just passing through\n\nImagine the horses when you set 'em free, go\n\nTear down the beaches of Chincoteague\n\n\n\nBut Bigfoot is out there just knowing you don't care\n\nAbout his life in solitude\n\nHe's dancing with the lonely he'd chose you only\n\nHe'd rock from side to side\n\n\n\nStay if you want to\n\nLeave if you have to\n\nI want to see him through the dark\n\nStay if you want to\n\nLeave if you have to\n\nI want to see him through the dark\n\n\n\nWhat love is gonna change your mind?\n\nWhat love is gonna change your mind?\n\nAnd Bigfoot running through the end of time\n\nWhat love is gonna change your mind?"
