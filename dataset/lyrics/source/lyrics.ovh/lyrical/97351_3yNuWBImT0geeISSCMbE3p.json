  "lyrics": "This is the gospel\r\nAccording to me\r\nA tale of whiskey turned to wine\r\nAin't no movin' of a mountain\r\nAin't no parting of the sea\n\nBut I stand here a witness\n\nOf something just as divine\n\n\n\nMy miracle\n\nIs five foot five\n\nNo doubt in my mind\n\nShe's the reason I'm alive\n\nI wasn't always spiritual\n\nOh, but one thing's for sure\n\nHow could I not have faith\n\nIn the God that created her\n\n\n\nMy momma used to pray someday I'd see the light\n\nI never thought it'd be in someone's eyes\n\nIn a crowded restaurant on a Friday night\n\nI heard angels sing\n\nMy whole life changed\n\nAnd I realized\n\n\n\nMy miracle\n\nIs standing right there\n\nLooking so beautiful\n\nWith blue jeans and long brown hair\n\nAnd I wasn't always spiritual\n\nOh, but one thing's for sure\n\nHow could I not have faith\n\nIn the God that created her\n\n\n\nYou see me now\n\nIt's crazy how\n\nMy life changed\n\nBut here I stand\n\nA better man\n\nAnd you can blame\n\nMy miracle\n\n\n\nI wasn't always spiritual\n\nOh, but one thing's for sure\n\nHow could I not have faith\n\nYeah, how could anybody not have faith\n\nIn the God that created her"
