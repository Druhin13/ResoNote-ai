  "lyrics": "Given all the silence, I could see the sky was taking its place.\r\nIf we're giving it all a title, I'll concede I might have made a mistake.\r\n'Cause I feel love, throwing it all away,\r\nI'm sleepless.\n\nSeven years of verses, I guess that I deserve it,\n\nI made a mistake!\n\nSo keep it on the surface, and tell me there was worth in\n\nAll the ways that it would break.\n\n\n\n'Cause I feel love, throwing it all away,\n\nI'm sleepless knowing you're all the same...\n\nHow'd only I feel it?\n\nHow'd only I feel it?\n\n\n\nIt's taken all the ivy from your throat,\n\nDoes it feel anymore like home?\n\nI made the walk from Albany to Rome,\n\nBut it feels there's nowhere more to go.\n\n\n\n'Cause I feel love, throwing it all away,\n\nI'm sleepless, and tell me you're all the same...\n\nHow'd only I feel it?\n\nHow'd only I feel it?"
