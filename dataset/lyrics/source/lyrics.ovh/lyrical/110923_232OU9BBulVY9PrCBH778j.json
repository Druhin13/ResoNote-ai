You don't get that back\n\nYou decay what I suffer through\n\nWhat did life put my muscles through?\n\nMade that boy indestructible\n\nWhy you can't tell me shit like a substitute\n\nMight pull up and just dump on you\n\nKeep it G in my element\n\nAll my P's and Q's come away with the W\n\n\n\nJust yesterday, I had everything\n\nEverything was nothing, but I ain't complain\n\nJust yesterday, we was everybody\n\nWe was all in the trenches knowing everybody\n\nJust yesterday, had to remind myself\n\nThe internet's a crazy place and so much of that shit is fake\n\nI'm a nineties bae, so I'll probably look you in the face\n\nAnd tell you I don't give a fuck 'bout whatever you tryna say\n\n\n\nThese applications ain't fit to lie on\n\nSome of y'all know me, but mostly, y'all dead wrong\n\nLabel me criminal, rap sheet a mile long\n\nI coulda been like you, but I had to grab my own\n\nSee I was in the west end, flexin', gettin' fitted for my rhinestones\n\nStarin' at the mirrors in the ceiling, reflectin' on my life, homes\n\nTellin' you we got our choppers, we don't need your fly over\n\nIf you need one man, I could call Tom and he'll be right over\n\nSee some of my niggas package up whatever and sell it to make a cent\n\nPut a shirt on and pull up to Sprint\n\nPut in work but they makin' no better and so they quit\n\nBlessings in disguise, I know what you were thinkin'\n\nThat nigga dance crazy, singin' at graduation\n\nThem niggas ain't gon' make it\n\nWho wrote this anyway? I did\n\nThat's how you whip up the story and cook it to life, kids\n\nYou should try it, ooh, you might even be amazed\n\nYou might even be the face of some generation\n\nThat's fuckin' the system for inspiration\n\nGun to the head like masturbation\n\n\n\nJust yesterday, I had everything\n\nEverything was nothing, but I ain't complain\n\nJust yesterday, we was everybody\n\nWe was all in the trenches knowing everybody\n\nJust yesterday, had to remind myself\n\nThe internet's a crazy place and so much of that shit is fake\n\nI'm a nineties bae, so I'll probably look you in the face\n\nAnd tell you I don't give a fuck 'bout whatever you tryna say"
