  "lyrics": "On a Greyhound thirty miles beyond Jamestown\r\nHe saw the sun set on the Tennessee line\r\nHe looked at the young man who was riding beside him\r\nHe said I'm old kind of worn out inside\r\nI worked my whole life in the steel mills of Gary\r\nAnd my father before me I helped build this land\n\nNow I'm seventy-seven and with God as my witness\n\nI earned every dollar that passed through my hands\n\nMy family and friends are the best thing I've known\n\nThrough the eye of the needle I'll carry them home\n\n\n\nDays turn to minutes\n\nAnd minutes to memories\n\nLife sweeps away the dreams\n\nThat we have planned\n\nYou are young and you are the future\n\nSo suck it up and tough it out\n\nAnd be the best you can\n\n\n\nThe rain hit the old dog in the twilight's last gleaming\n\nHe said Son it sounds like rattling old bones\n\nThis highway is long but I know some that are longer\n\nBy sunup tomorrow I guess I'll be home\n\nThrough the hills of Kentucky 'cross the Ohio river\n\nThe old man kept talking 'bout his life and his times\n\nHe fell asleep with his head against the window\n\nHe said an honest man's pillow is his peace of mind\n\nThis world offers riches and riches will grow wings\n\nI don't take stock in those uncertain things\n\n\n\nDays turn to minutes\n\nAnd minutes to memories\n\nLife sweeps away the dreams\n\nThat we have planned\n\nYou are young and you are the future\n\nSo suck it up and tough it out\n\nAnd be the best you can\n\n\n\nThe old man had a vision but it was hard for me to follow\n\nI do things my way and I pay a high price\n\nWhen I think back on the old man and the bus ride\n\nNow that I'm older I can see he was right\n\n\n\nAnother hot one out on highway eleven\n\nThis is my life It's what I've chosen to do\n\nThere are no free rides No one said it'd be easy\n\nThe old man told me this my son i'm telling it to you\n\n\n\nDays turn to minutes\n\nAnd minutes to memories\n\nLife sweeps away the dreams\n\nThat we have planned\n\nYou are young and you are the future\n\nSo suck it up and tough it out\n\nAnd be the best you can"
