  "lyrics": "Love is a stranger \nIn an open car \nTo tempt you in \nAnd drive you far away \nAnd I want you \nAnd I want you \n\nAnd I want you so \n\nIt's an obsession \n\n\n\nLove is a danger \n\nOf a different kind \n\nTo take you away \n\nAnd leave you far behind \n\nAnd love love love \n\nIs a dangerous drug \n\nYou have to receive it \n\nAnd you still can't \n\nGet enough of the stuff \n\n\n\nIt's savage and it's cruel \n\nAnd it shines like destruction \n\nComes in like the flood \n\nAnd it seems like religion \n\nIt's noble and it's brutal \n\nIt distorts and deranges \n\nAnd it wrenches you up \n\nAnd you're left like a zombie \n\n\n\nAnd I want you \n\nAnd I want you \n\nAnd I want you so \n\nIt's an obsession \n\n\n\nIt's guilt edged \n\nGlamorous and sleek by design \n\nYou know it's jealous by nature \n\nFalse and unkind \n\nIt's hard and restrained \n\nAnd it's totally cool \n\nIt touches and it teases \n\nAs you stumble in the debris \n\n\n\nAnd I want you \n\nAnd I want you \n\nAnd I want you so \n\nIt's an obsession"
