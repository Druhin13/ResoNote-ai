Or won't?\n\nI know, beggars can't be choosers\n\nAnd all I know is alright\n\nFor me, for you\n\nPut your money where your mouth is\n\n\n\nYeah, I've got a new idea\n\nWhy don't you stay right here?\n\nMake yourself comfortable\n\nTake the front row when in front of a mirror\n\nLove sympathy, no I don't think so (Don't think)\n\nNo empathy is not enough to drink so (So drink)\n\nDon't mention me\n\nYou're so interesting\n\nAdmission of guilt like an entrance fee\n\n\n\nPick up the phone\n\nIf nobody's home\n\nI'm the one you want (Yeah, uh)\n\nAll you think about\n\nKeep it in your mouth\n\nBut it's written down (Uh, yeah)\n\n\n\nYou're so insecure\n\nBut I'm so far from here\n\nI'm thinking up all the texts you won't send\n\nLittle three dots don't disappear"
