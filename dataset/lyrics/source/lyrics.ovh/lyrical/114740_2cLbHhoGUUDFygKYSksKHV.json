  "lyrics": "PFG's coming cross the creek\r\nZ71, headlights shinin through the trees\r\nThe boys spill out of the back seat\r\nAnd ask me, what's it gonna be tonight\r\nI said I'm just trying to get loose, trying to make a move\r\nDon't matter what we do\n\n\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\nSomewhere where we can go\n\nGet away from it all, get lost\n\nAnd god only knows where we'll go\n\nAnd hell I don't care\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\n\n\nWe pulled in, threw it in park\n\nAnd follow the orange glow in the dark\n\nAnd the trail marks\n\nThrough the fire and flames we locked eyes\n\nShe walked over from the other side\n\nAnd smiled when I said\n\nI'm just trying to get loose, trying to set the mood\n\nDon't matter what we do\n\n\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\nSomewhere where we can go\n\nGet away from it all, get lost\n\nAnd god only knows where we'll go\n\nAnd baby I don't care\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\n\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\nSomewhere where we can go\n\nGet away from it all, get lost\n\nAnd god only knows where we'll go\n\nAnd hell I don't care\n\nAs long as we're out there\n\nAs long as we're out there"
