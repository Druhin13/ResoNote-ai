  "lyrics": "Where the fields go from a dark brown\r\nTo a riveting bright yellow\r\nWhere the cars slow their speed down\r\nAnd the boats glide on mirrored sea\r\nWhere the sun don't ever set\r\nOr it never comes up\n\nWhere the sky turns violet\n\nAnd the weather don't stop\n\n\n\nI spent so long looking for a way\n\nI could be a part of another home\n\nI tried so hard blocking out the waves\n\nBut my ocean heart never let it go\n\n\n\nThis people, my people\n\nSea people can not really leave\n\nThis people, my people\n\nSea people come back to the sea\n\nCome back to the sea\n\n\n\nWhere the forest with its fir trees\n\nBow their heads in snow greetings\n\nWhere the town sleeps and the sea freeze\n\nAnd you think it won't ever melt\n\nWhere the wind is violent\n\nSo we raise the sails up\n\nWhere the ancient mountains\n\nAre the ruler of us\n\n\n\nI spent so long looking for a way\n\nI could be a part of another home\n\nI tried so hard blocking out the waves\n\nBut my ocean heart never let it go\n\n\n\nThis people, my people\n\nSea people can not really leave\n\nThis people, my people\n\nSea people come back to the sea\n\nWe come back to the sea\n\n\n\nOh\n\nOh\n\nOh\n\nOh\n\n\n\nAnd I spent so long looking for a way\n\nI could be a part of another home\n\nAnd I tried so hard blocking out the waves\n\nBut my ocean heart never let it go\n\n\n\nThis people, my people\n\nSea people can not really leave\n\nThis people, my people\n\nSea people come back to the sea\n\nCome back to the sea\n\nWe come back to the sea"
