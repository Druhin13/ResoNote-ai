  "lyrics": "Though I tried before to tell him\r\nAll the feelings I have for him in my heart\r\nEverytime that I come near him\r\nI just loose my nerve as I've done from the start\r\n(Chorus)\r\nCoz every little thing he does is magic\n\nEvery thing he does just turns me on\n\nEven though my life before was tragic\n\nNow I know my love for him goes on\n\nDo I have to tell the story\n\nOf the thousand rainy days since we first met\n\nIt's a big enough umbrella\n\nBut it's always me who ends up getting wet\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nI resolve to call him up\n\nA thousand times a day\n\nAnd ask him if he'll marry me\n\nIn some old fashioned way\n\nBut my silent fears have gripped me\n\nLong before I reached the phone\n\nLong before my tongue has stripped me\n\nMust I always be alone\n\n(Repeat Chorus)\n\nEvery little thing\n\nEvery little thing he does\n\nEvery little thing he does is magic, magic, magic"
