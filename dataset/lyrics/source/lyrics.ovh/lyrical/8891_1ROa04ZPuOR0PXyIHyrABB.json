  "lyrics": "Don't ever you're broken or not good enough\r\nCause all the things you wanna fix are things that I love\r\nI'll tell you now, there's nothing for your to hide\r\nI know who are inside, you're all that I need\r\nDon't listen to the voices saying otherwise\r\nLook into my eyes, listen to me\n\n\n\nYou have never been more beautiful\n\nThan you are now and you don't even know\n\nDon't be afraid of being vulnerable\n\n'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful\n\n\n\nYou don't see yourself the same anymore\n\nAnd say I don't look at you like I did before\n\nThose imperfections give you insecurities\n\nBut they fit you perfectly, don't change a thing\n\nThey make you who are and you are who I want\n\nI'm begging from my heart so won't you listen to me?\n\n\n\nYou have never been more beautiful\n\nThan you are now and you don't even know\n\nDon't be afraid of being vulnerable\n\n'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful\n\n\n\nYou have never been more beautiful\n\nThan you are now and you don't even know\n\nDon't be afraid of being vulnerable\n\n'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful\n\n\n\nJust show me what you've covered\n\nIt'll make me only want you more\n\n'Cause I'm aching to discover\n\nIf there's any other scars I haven't seen before\n\n\n\nIt's true I don't look at you like I did before\n\n'Cause when I look at you now I want you even more\n\n\n\nYou have never been more beautiful\n\nThan you are now and you don't even know\n\nDon't be afraid of being vulnerable\n\n'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful\n\n\n\nYou have never been more beautiful\n\nThan you are now when the real you show\n\nThere's nop shame in being vulnerable\n\n'Cause you have never been, never been more beautiful"
