  "title": "Willow Weep For Me",
  "lyrics": "Willow weep for me, willow weep for me,\rBend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea,\rListen to my plea, listen willow weep for me,\rGone my lover's dream, lovely summer dream,\rGone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream,\rSad as I can be - Hear me willow and weep for me.\rWhisper to the wind to say that love has sinned\rTo leave my heart aching and making this moan,\rMurmur to the night to hide her starry light,\rSo none will find me sighing and crying all alone,\rWeeping willow tree, weep in sympathy,\rBend your branches down along the ground and cover me,\rWhen the shadows fall, bend oh willow and weep for me.\rTo leave my heart aching and making this moan,\rSo none will find me sighing and crying all alone,\rWeeping willow tree, weep in sympathy,\rBend your branches down along the ground and cover me,\rWhen the shadows fall, bend oh willow,\rBend oh willow and weep for me."
