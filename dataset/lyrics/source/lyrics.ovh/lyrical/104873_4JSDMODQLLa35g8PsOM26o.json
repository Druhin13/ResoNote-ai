  "lyrics": "It's a new day\r\nWind up the music box and watch the city go\r\nAlways the same\r\nWatching neighbours on the pavements rock 'n' roll\r\nFlicking through your inbox hundred miles an hour\r\nOh, forever dreaming lullaby\n\n\n\nYou can run, you can jump, I fuck it up\n\nBut you can't blame yourself, no, you're just human\n\nCome on, come on\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\n\n\nIf it's a new day\n\nWhy don't we invent a new world to explore?\n\nWhy don't we create a moment to remember in five years?\n\nWinner's just a word, and loser's just one too\n\nOh, forever dreaming lullaby\n\n\n\nYou can run, you can jump, I fuck it up\n\nBut you can't blame yourself, no, you're just human\n\nCome on, come on\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\n\n\nWinner's just a word, loser's just one too\n\nOh, forever dreaming lullaby\n\n\n\nYou can run, you can jump, I fuck it up\n\nBut you can't blame yourself, no, you're just human\n\nCome on, come on\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\nYou can run, you can jump, I fuck it up\n\nBut you can't blame yourself, no, you're just human\n\nCome on, come on\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\nCome on, come on\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human\n\nNo, you can't blame yourself, you're just human"
