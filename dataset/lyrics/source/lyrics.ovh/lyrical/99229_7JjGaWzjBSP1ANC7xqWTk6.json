You'll never know\n\nI’ll love her ‘til forever on\n\n'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know\n\nYou're all alone\n\nDoes she love you? You'll never know\n\nI’ll love her ‘til forever on\n\n'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know\n\n\n\nI was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room\n\nOut in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room\n\nToo much to handle, too much to handle on my own\n\nI lit the candle, I lit the candle in my room\n\n\n\nIt's all lost\n\nCigarette smoke spark in the dark, ash\n\nBaby girl I worry about you, you never talk\n\nAnd, I guess that's the way now\n\nI guess that's the way\n\n\n\nYou're all alone\n\nDoes she love you? You'll never know\n\nI’ll love her ‘til forever on\n\n'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know\n\nYou're all alone\n\nDoes she love you? You'll never know\n\nI’ll love her ‘til forever on\n\n'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know\n\n\n\nI was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room\n\nOut in the shadows, out in the shadows in my room\n\nI was the chateau, I was the chateau in my room\n\nToo much to handle, too much to handle\n\n\n\nOh boy you're lost now\n\nVoices in your head gone now\n\nI heard you and so-and-so had a falling out\n\nWhat was that about?\n\nSomething happened then she shot him down\n\nJust be happy that she not around\n\nBoy you not a hero, you a problem child\n\nWhat type of fire have you started now?\n\nThat was all your homies, that was not a crowd\n\nAlways walking round, head up in the clouds\n\nKeep me humble baby, sit me down\n\nSo lost\n\nSit alone in my room waiting for the dark\n\nCigarette smoke lights, see the sparks\n\nI seek your soul, I'm trapped in my room\n\n\n\nYou're all alone\n\nDoes she love you? You'll never know\n\nI’ll love her ‘til forever on\n\n'Til she kills my soul, you're all that I'll know\n\n\n\nI'm all alone\n\nWhy can't you just call my phone? (I have a question)\n\nI'm here girl, just come on home\n\nMy secrets, you will never know (You will never know)\n\nWhy are you so incredible? (Why are you so incredible?)\n\nWhy can't I be eligible? (Why can't I be eligible?)\n\nDid I skip you cause I'm telling untold?\n\nAnd I'll go\n\n\n\nI was a lost boy, I was a lost boy in my room\n\nI'm just a lost boy, I'm just a lost boy\n\nI don't look outside, no I don't at all\n\nLoving is after us, I hear there's a love for us\n\nI know there's a love for us, I know you're on to shit\n\nI know you're by yourself\n\nI know there's a love for us, for all our accomplishments\n\nThis is beyond our sin, I do not want this shit\n\nI was a lost boy, I do not got a choice\n\nI couldn't live alone, all I got is my voice\n\nWe couldn't conversate, you didn't wanna talk\n\nI don't wanna fight with you, just wanna spend the night with you\n\n\n\nSyre died in the sunset, don't be like him\n\nMan that's where the story ends, but it also begins\n\nHe's building pyramids, he's getting serious\n\nUntil he drove himself delirious, like are you hearing this\n\nThis ain't an outer body conversation about conspiracists\n\nEven though I may appear as this, see Syre grew a tear in his eye\n\nBecause the summer’s too bright for his spirit in the night\n\nThere’s a python in the pyramids\n\nLook, this is for the kids feeling lost\n\nSleep on the street, eating the moss\n\nI don’t got no more teeth in my jaws\n\nCause I ripped them out, I’m sick of killing innocents at large\n\nThis is for the kids feeling lost\n\nMSFTS got you at all costs\n\nYelling \"fuck 'em all\", we hold each other, we never fall\n\nIt’s us versus the all, from my cats to my dogs forever\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nI let that one rock, I let that one rock\n\nCheck it out, this the bonus track, this the bonus\n\nMy favorite albums used to have the bonus track, you know what I’m saying?\n\nThis that Madison Square Garden\n\nShout out the whole MSFTS team\n\nDesign team, couture team, you know what I’m saying\n\nShouts out Teo, Willow, Dessa, Moi, Harry\n\nTrue, Daniel\n\nShout out Capital-A, shouts out Omar, shouts out Miguel\n\nShouts out Roc Na-, oh that's Hov calling\n\nMSFTS Music, shouts out Jabs, Tyler Cole\n\nYoung black rockstars doing this shit\n\nThis like, this like that shoutout track, you know what I'm saying?\n\nWhen the whole block gets a shoutout\n\nShouts out Ro, shouts out Chris, Mallik\n\nShouts out Conner, Conda, Ian\n\nYeah, yeah, Nico, yeah, yeah\n\nShouts out Willow, yeah, yeah, James\n\nMSFTS Music on this shit, you know what I’m saying\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nThis is for the kids feeling lost"
