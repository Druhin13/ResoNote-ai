  "lyrics": "I know your eye's in the morning sun\r\nI feel you touch me in the pouring rain\r\nAnd the moment that you wander far from me\r\nI wanna feel you in my arms again\r\nAnd you come to me on a summer breeze\r\nKeep me warm in your love, then you softly leave\n\n\n\nAnd it's me you need to show\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\n\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\nI really need to learn\n\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down, when they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me\n\n\n\nI believe in you, you know the door to my fairy soul\n\nYou're the light I'm my deepest darkest song\n\nYou're my savior without fault\n\nAnd you may not think that I care for you\n\nWhen you know down inside that I really do\n\n\n\nAnd it's me you need to show\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\n\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\nI really need to learn\n\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down, when they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me\n\n\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\nHow deep is your love?\n\nI really need to learn\n\n'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down, when they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me"
