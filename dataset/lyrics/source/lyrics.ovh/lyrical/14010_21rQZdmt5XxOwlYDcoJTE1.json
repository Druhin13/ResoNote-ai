  "lyrics": "Innocent idols who turn me on\r\nWhile selling bibles to babies\r\nWe sleep for a while but then you are gone\r\nAll I have left is the story\r\nAll I can see before me is the darkest blues\n\nBecause I slip to the depths without you\n\n\n\nIf I met a waitress could she turn me on\n\nI got the time to let her know me\n\nI keep my focus but my dreams keeps me strong\n\nI come abreast of it slowly\n\n\n\nAll I can see before me is the darkest blue\n\nBecause I slip to the depths without you\n\n\n\nSo many hours that I see before me\n\nNow the stars are out of view\n\nBecause I slip to the depths without you"
