  "lyrics": "Like a comedian star\r\nI waited for the bus to pull away\r\nAnd through the fumes\r\nA picture view\r\nAnd your funny face\r\nAnd pictures of you\n\nStanding in-between a laundry mat\n\nAnd the gallery window\n\nWith the piece of art that looked like trash\n\n\n\nPictures of you\n\nPictures of you\n\nPictures of you\n\nWhen we were young\n\nWhen we were young\n\n\n\nLovin' the future is just a fantasy\n\nLovin' the past is just a memory\n\nA picture of you standing somewhere in-between\n\nStanding between the trees\n\nAnd the cleaners\n\nAnd the broken mirrors\n\nAnd the trashcan feeders\n\n\n\nPictures of you\n\nPictures of you\n\nPictures of you\n\nWhen we were young\n\nWhen we were young\n\n\n\nPictures of you"
