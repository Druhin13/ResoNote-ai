  "lyrics": "I had a dream that we were doing hard drugs in a street alley\r\nYou were lying dead next to me\r\nYou said you had a vision of Vietnam\r\nYou saw me jump on a grenade and watched my limbs fall off\r\nBut I was in heaven then\n\nI don't care who's asking, you can tell them the truth\n\nI've had a longtime struggle with substance abuse\n\nBut I feel fine\n\nAnd if you really think he loves and you want to go away\n\nWell, I want the best and I'm not here to make you stay\n\nI'm just glad that I found you\n\nAnd sorry that I couldn't keep you around\n\n\n\nWe took you to the urgent care\n\nThey turned us away\n\nYou had an outstanding balance we couldn't pay\n\nYou started crying\n\nThen in the pouring rain we found you a hospital bed\n\nAnd when they picked you up to move you\n\nAll the sheets were red\n\nYou were a woman then\n\n\n\nWell I don't know who's asking, but I'll them the truth\n\nI've had a real hard time losing you\n\nAnd you can tell me that he loves you, but I know it's a lie\n\n'Cause I've seen how he treats you\n\nAnd honey I don't want to fight\n\nI'm just glad that I found you\n\nAnd sorry that I couldn't keep you around\n\n\n\nWell I don't care who's asking, you can tell them the truth\n\nI've had a hard time living and I know you'd had a hard time too\n\nAnd if you want to know who loves you\n\nYou can start right here\n\nBut don't come home just to leave\n\n'Cause I'm glad that I found you\n\nBut I don't want you to leave me hanging around"
