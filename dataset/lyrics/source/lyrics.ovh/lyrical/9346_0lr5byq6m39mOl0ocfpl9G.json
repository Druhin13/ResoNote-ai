  "lyrics": "What do you say we leave a little crack in the window?\r\nWhat a lovely day, we should leave the curtains drawn\r\nWe're just two neighbors sending a friendly \"hello\"\r\nAnd we really like to know what's going on\r\nWho's the new-in, what's he doing in the neighborhood?\n\nWe should bake him a pecan or apple pie\n\nWe insist they can't resist it 'cause it tastes so good\n\nThough they may think it's 'cause we're sweet\n\nWe get to sneak a peek inside\n\n\n\nThat's why we leave a itty-bitty crack in the window\n\nThat's why we tend the roses in the lawn\n\nWe're just two neighbors sending a friendly \"hello\"\n\nAnd we really like to know what's going on\n\n\n\nWhat's going on\n\nWhat's going on"
