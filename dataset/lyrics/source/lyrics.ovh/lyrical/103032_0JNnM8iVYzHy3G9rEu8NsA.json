  "lyrics": "They said love was a thing of the past\r\nThat these days nothing ever lasts\r\nThis old world is movin' too fast\r\nWell sometimes we ride around\r\nShe plays her radio up loud\n\nIf I was sad, well, I'm happy now\n\n\n\nAnd it feels so good to know\n\nI got you where you belong\n\nHere in my heart, right by my side\n\nHoney you're getting me by\n\nYeah you're keeping me alive\n\n\n\nI got a job, I work hard\n\nThese days the money don't go very far\n\nIt's hard enough keeping gas in the car\n\n\n\nBut sometimes we ride around\n\nShe plays the radio up load\n\nIf I was sad, well, I'm happy now\n\n\n\nYeah and it feels so good to know\n\nI got you where you belong\n\nHere in my heart, right by my side\n\nHoney you're getting me by\n\nYeah you're keeping me alive\n\n\n\nAnd it feels so good to know\n\nI got you where you belong\n\nHere in my heart, right by my side\n\nHoney you're getting me by\n\nYeah you're keeping me alive\n\nYeah you're keeping me alive\n\nYeah you're keeping me alive"
