  "lyrics": "Even when the darkness fills my skies\r\nThe faith within my well has run dry\r\nThe hope I had is fading from my eyes\r\nYour love is unfailing\r\nYour love is what saves me\n\nFather let Your love pour out\n\nLet Your love rain down\n\nOn me, on me, on me\n\nFather I want nothing less\n\nCome and fill up every breath\n\nI breathe, I breathe, I breathe\n\n\n\nWhen the wind is stolen from my sails\n\nWhen my mind has traveled desperate trails\n\nBefore I even find the strength to cry for help\n\nYour love is unfailing\n\nYour love is what saves me\n\n\n\nFather let Your love pour out\n\nLet Your love rain down\n\nOn me, on me, on me\n\nFather I want nothing less\n\nCome and fill up every breath\n\nI breathe, I breathe, I breathe\n\n\n\nEverything I need, in You I find\n\nMy Father's love for me, is better than life\n\n\n\nFather let Your love pour out\n\nLet Your love rain down\n\nOn me, on me, on me\n\nFather I want nothing less\n\nCome and fill up every breath\n\nI breathe, I breathe, I breathe"
