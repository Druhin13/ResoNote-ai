Got me fucked up, I’m pullin’ up, I'm hangin’ out the window\nFuck you if my nigga jacked him, stole a ring, confidential\nDon't get this shit twisted, I'll pull up, split your fuckin' head\nI been gettin’ the bread lately, niggas say I'm goin' fed\nDon't question me about a murder, all I know that boy dead\nWe stand on your block, a hundred shots, knock out your fuckin' dreads\nWhat's up with the dissin? Pull up on me, little bitch, show me somethin'\nI was on my dick and I couldn't pay a bitch to throw me nothin'\n\nStop with all that lyin', state facts\nYou playin' with a nigga, make me blow your fuckin' act\nClutchin' on a blackout and a bag\nI just hit up B-Mack, he said he know where they at\n\n(Go, go) We gon' get him gone\nScope that bitch from up close and take off his fucking dome\nWe rollin' right in the trenches, we lurkin, they ain't at home\nI'm killin' shit by my niggas, don't care if they right or wrong\nI didn't get out his body, gon' turn that bitch to a ghost\nBlackout attached to my body, I upped it and do the most\n\nNo, we is not sparin' shit, we seen everybody go\nWon't shoot the bitch from a distance, I'm killin' you bitches close\n\nWatch that car, that bitch keep passin' by and I don't know who in there\nIf it come back through here one more time just shoot whoever in there\nIn the trenches, shit be real, so bitch, stay up in your lane\nDon't give a fuck about no witness, we gon' up and blow his brain\nBitch, if I go broke them niggas know I'm quick to hit his thang\nHad to let him go 'cause that bitch dough was bringin' too much pain\nThey want clout so they diss on the internet just for the fame\n\nWho to blame? We can't catch 'em, this shit drivin' me insane\nWhen we do this out the window I bet all you see is flames\nNiggas hoes and they know that, up it and push his 'fro back\nWe be posted where the sto' at, spot 'em and we get on that\nNo remorse for you lil' niggas, it's old and I'm gon' blow that\n\n(Blow, blow) We gon' get him gone\nScope that bitch from up close and take off his fucking dome\nWe rollin' right in the trenches, we lurkin, they ain't at home\nI'm killin' shit by my niggas, don't care if they right or wrong\n\nI didn't get out his body, gon' turn that bitch to a ghost\nBlackout attached to my body, I upped it and do the most\nNo, we is not sparin' shit, we seen everybody go\nWon't shoot the bitch from a distance, I'm killin' you bitches close"
