Do you know you look good? I know I look good, nigga)\n\nWe a real nice black\n\n(The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice)\n\nDark chocolate\n\nAin't no more sitting in the back\n\nAin't gotta front, I know what you want\n\nI can meet you where you at\n\nWith the naked truth\n\n\n\nAyy, ayy\n\nTalk dirty to me with it too\n\nGive me how it takes\n\nGive me proof\n\nGive a chance to prove that a man improved\n\nI'ma say I grew\n\nThey gon' say I pulled a switcharoo\n\nBut they is who?\n\nAll that jogging in place is cool\n\nBut that shit stayed in school for me partly because somebody was brutally honest\n\nPointed out social constructs I foolishly honored\n\nI booted these false concepts that diluted these waters\n\nWas trying to be true to the nigga I was claiming to be\n\nNow I'm really real\n\nTrying to get old like a philly shell\n\nDon't nobody want no smoke with me, from spoken words to poetry\n\nTo polarizing social content posted I got more of the type\n\nAnd it all took a sprite from advice\n\nThat one wouldn't considered nice\n\nThat's alright, it helped me take flight\n\nI used to fall but the floor is so velvety\n\nThat we still had the Velveeta stacking nice\n\nRarely flexing or advertising\n\nI ain't stressing too hard\n\n\n\nBut hey, but hey we look good\n\n(You look good, girl. Do you know you look good? I know I look good, nigga)\n\nWe a real nice black\n\n(The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice)\n\nDark chocolate\n\nAin't no more sitting in the back\n\nAin't gotta front, I know what you want\n\nI can meet you where you at\n\nWith the naked truth\n\n\n\nI dare you to strip it down\n\nIt's plenty dollars out here to pay you to keep it on\n\nYou'll pop your collar as long as you go and play the role\n\nI'm popping bottles of starch niggas know I can't fold\n\nI hope your water is as smart as you claim to be online\n\nThey call you by your username offline\n\nI usually pay no mind\n\nI just cannot get used to niggas using that shit to define themselves\n\nYou'll lose me every time trying to align myself with real niggas\n\nYou confuse me every time you say you're feeling free\n\nCan't see where my ceiling be\n\nThink that's why those trapped in boxes can't see where I'm coming from\n\nWe just ain't there mentally\n\nExpose myself to myself\n\nWhat the fuck you running from fam?\n\nWe can feel your energy\n\nThe hate gon' always cost you sort of love, it's complementary\n\nWallet full of centuries, I still can't get that time back\n\nProtect the pocket like a lineback\n\nWhere these niggas draw the line at?\n\nDon't let me find out that they don't draw one at all\n\nI spit the naked truth, I'm drawing it raw\n\nI speak on it all, not peaking at all\n\nNo rallies in sight, I rally to fight\n\n\n\nWith the naked truth"
