  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson On The Train Ride Home par The Paper Kites\r\nWaiting down at the station\nI don't remember, I think it was late then\nStanding, always so quiet\nWe're like elevators, filled up with strangers\n\nNo sound, no Hallelujahs\nStill I was praying on the train ride home\nIf I can't get the things I want\nIf I can't get the things I want\nJust give me what I need\n\nOur words fill up the pages\nFill up the days with songs for the ages\nStill those vows that we all speak\nWe break them like concrete and just make our words cheap\n\n\nI want someone to grow with\nSongs I can sing to and a family to cling to\nBut if I can't get the things I want\nIf I can't get the things I want\nJust give me what I need\nJust give me what I need"
