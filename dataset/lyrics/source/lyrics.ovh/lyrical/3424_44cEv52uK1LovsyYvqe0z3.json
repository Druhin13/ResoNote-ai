  "lyrics": "I will never let you go\r\nI know you want it, I know you want it.\r\nLearning love means not to know.\r\nI'll learn to take it, learn to take it love.\r\nI will never leave your fears\n\nI know you're lost now, know you're lost now.\n\nCounting days won't buy us years\n\nWe'll star it over, start it over love\n\n\n\nI'll never let the magic go, I'll float away into your afterglow\n\nI'll never let you go, I'll melt away into your afterglow.\n\n\n\nThe sky will melt in tears\n\nI'll float away into your afterglow\n\nThe sky will melt in tears\n\nI'll melt away into your afterglow\n\n\n\nPeople never smile to say goodbye.\n\nLeaving means there's nothing left to try.\n\nBut I broke my wings for you.\n\nI smiled as you untied our love for good.\n\n\n\nThe sky will melt in tears\n\nI'll float away into your afterglow\n\nThe sky will melt in tears\n\nI'll melt away into your afterglow\n\n\n\nThe sky will melt in tears\n\nI'll melt away into your afterglow\n\nThe sky will melt in tears\n\nI'll float away into your afterglow"
