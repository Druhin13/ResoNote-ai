  "lyrics": "Oh, mother, come save me\r\nI lost the mind you gave me\r\nIt's howling at the wind\r\nThese voices in my dreams\r\nThey're calling out again\n\n\n\nOh, father, please hear me\n\nIt's hard to see things clearly\n\nNow these clouds are closing in\n\n\n\nWhen they're forming in my skin\n\nI feel them closing in\n\n\n\nHow'd we end up here?\n\nHow'd we get so lost?\n\nHow'd we end up here?\n\nHow'd we get so lost?\n\n\n\nOh, lover, forgive me\n\nMy fickle heart is twisted in\n\nIt's turning in the wind\n\nWell, I'm trying to reel it in\n\nIt's failing me again\n\n\n\nYou see I bought a ticket for a one way train\n\nAnd I don't know if I'll return again\n\n'Cause I traded in my friends\n\n\n\nFor a world I've never seen\n\nFor a place I've never been\n\n\n\nHow'd we end up here?\n\nHow'd we get so lost?\n\nHow'd we end up here?\n\nHow'd we get so lost?\n\n\n\nMy-my-my-my\n\nMy-my-my-my\n\nMy-my-my-my\n\nMy-my-my-my\n\nMy-my-my\n\n\n\nHow'd we end up here?\n\nHow'd we get so lost?\n\nHow'd we end up here?\n\nHow'd we get so lost?\n\n\n\nIf my heart wants the wind\n\nI lift you up again\n\nIf my heart wants the wind\n\nI lift you up again"
