  "lyrics": "Sometimes when I'm in heaven\r\nI get the kid full lovelier\r\nUntil I end big, like real-life poison bloods\r\nThe heat is on\r\nSpeak soft when the seat is down\n\nI got a pocket full of deadliness\n\nOpium den mother, forget my head\n\nAt the dead-end of unsteadiness\n\nBox blondes have less fun\n\n\n\nBoomerang my head\n\nBack to the city I grew up in\n\nAgain and again and again\n\nForever a lake effect kid\n\n\n\nI got the skyline in my veins\n\nForget your night times\n\nSummer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel\n\nAnd joke us, joke us\n\n'Til \\\"Lake Shore Drive\\\" comes back into focus\n\nI just want to come back to lying sparks into your ear\n\nto keep you warm and mine\n\n\n\nI got a pocket full of deadliness\n\nOpium den mother, forget my head\n\nAt the dead-end of unsteadiness\n\nBox blondes have less fun, fun\n\n\n\nBoomerang my head\n\nBack to the city I grew up in\n\nAgain and again\n\nForever a lake effect kid\n\n\n\nBoomerang my head\n\nBack to the city I grew up in\n\nAgain and again and again\n\nForever a lake effect kid\n\n\n\nBoomerang my head\n\nBack to the city I grew up in\n\nAgain and again and again\n\nForever a lake effect kid\n\n\n\nBoomerang my head\n\nBack to the city I grew up in\n\nAgain and again and again\n\nForever a lake effect kid\n\n\n\n(Thanks to zachery for these lyrics)"
