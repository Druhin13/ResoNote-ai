  "lyrics": "There was a boy\r\nA very strange enchanted boy\r\nThey say he wandered very far, very far\r\nOver land and sea\r\nA little shy\r\nAnd sad of eye\n\nBut very wise\n\nWas he\n\n\n\nAnd then one day\n\nA magic day he came my way\n\nAnd while we spoke of many things, fools and kings\n\nThis he said to me\n\n\"The greatest thing\n\nYou'll ever learn\n\nIs just to love\n\nAnd be loved\n\nIn return\"\n\n\n\n(instrumental interlude)\n\n\n\n\"The greatest thing\n\nYou'll ever learn\n\nIs just to love\n\nAnd be loved\n\nIn return\""
