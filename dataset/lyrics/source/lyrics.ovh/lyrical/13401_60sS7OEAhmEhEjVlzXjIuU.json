  "lyrics": "Feels like I'm running in circles\r\nStuck on the stairs between stories\r\nI'm tired and I'm bored of the same thing\r\nBut I can't stop thinking about a one way ticket out\r\nI don't care if it rains everyday where I'm going\n\nI'd rather have an umbrella than be staring out the window\n\n\n\nSo tell me\n\nWhy I can't live my life this way\n\nAnd tell me\n\nWhy I should stay\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel like a boxer\n\nAnd I'm just beating myself up\n\nI can't let it be my fault I'm still here\n\nI've been trying for months and failing for years\n\n\n\nI just want to get out of this place\n\nI'd hit the road with the change in my pocket\n\nI don't care if it rains everyday\n\nI'd rather have an umbrella than be staring out the window\n\n\n\nMaybe years from now I will see you in town\n\nAnd I’ll wonder why I ever tried to listen to ya\n\nAnd you’ll notice me as you try to seem\n\nBetter than everything you bet that I would never be"
