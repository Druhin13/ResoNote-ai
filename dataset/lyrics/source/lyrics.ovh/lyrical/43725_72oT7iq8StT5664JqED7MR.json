  "lyrics": "So cold my soul's numb\r\nLike an icy breeze on solstice morning\r\nThe worst enemy's one that's homegrown\r\nThis is more than just a faceless warning.\r\nDon't let the world rot\n\nDon't let the world rot\n\nHanging by a thread they just putrefy\n\nOur blood our birth our sky\n\nAnd we will not stand by\n\nDon't let the world rot\n\n\n\nSo warm the sun burns my soul\n\nLike the fossils in the earth they take my breath\n\n\n\nBlack blood bleeding heart filled stone\n\nTake the power away from the hands of death\n\n\n\nA web of minds connected\n\nTake purpose,\n\nTake action\n\nCause a reaction\n\nEntangle the spiders\n\nMake sense of this mess\n\nA mind at large\n\nIs a power they can't repress\n\n\n\nWe are all connected\n\nWe are one you and I\n\nYeah we will not stand by\n\n\n\nDon't let the world rot\n\n\n\nOmnipotent mind at large\n\nSick of living underhanded\n\nThis is our life we command it\n\nGo\n\nWe can't all hide in fear\n\nA time of reckoning is near\n\nWe are all connected\n\nDon't let the world rot\n\n\n\nWe can't all hide in fear\n\nA time of reckoning is near\n\nWe are all connected\n\nA web of minds connected\n\nTake purpose,\n\nTake action,\n\nCause a reaction\n\nEntangle the spiders\n\nMake sense of this mess\n\nA mind at large\n\nIs a power they can't repress\n\n\n\nSick of living underhanded\n\nThis is our life we command it"
