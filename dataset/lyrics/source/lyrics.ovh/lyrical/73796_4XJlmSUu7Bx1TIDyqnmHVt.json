  "lyrics": "You’ll be mine, get in my coffin\r\nGive me a cross stitch on the wall, give me a garden\r\nThat grows forever always in bloom\r\nMorning light and coffee cups; Alchemy your bones & blood\r\nAn hour late for 27\n\nI have known you in my head, shaking lips and nervous red\n\nYou see me die, you see me trying\n\nScrape my knees down to the bone, fall asleep while driving home We’re making gold\n\n\n\nBut am I right? To shift my gaze\n\nTo see us holding hands in June? See me falling to you?\n\nYou’re the floodlight, I’m the asphalt\n\nMorning light and coffee cups; Alchemy your bones & blood\n\nWe’re making gold\n\n\n\nIn the back of my head\n\nThere's a spaceship theres a skip in\n\nEvery step, I got stuck, tried to jump the wire fence\n\nThere’s more than one\n\nMore to come\n\nMore than anybody knows\n\nAnd I've always felt I deserved less\n\n\n\nWe shut the blinds, tipped the scales\n\nHung from every picture rail\n\nI read my script, from your palm\n\nWrote a million little songs\n\nEach one a piece from the jigsaw\n\nWe were pictured on\n\nAnd I always felt I deserved less, and I always felt I deserved less\n\nI still feel I deserve less\n\n\n\nSo I won’t lie and you won’t hide\n\nAnd if I split myself in two I’ll just come running home to you\n\nWe’re making gold"
