  "lyrics": "We’ve come to replace your clock’s old stubborn hands\r\nWe are the answer to why they never had a chance\r\nIt was not so long ago that the world was mostly slow\r\nThe age of iron, steam and speed\r\nTurned a stroll to a stampede\r\nBut we’ve come to increase time in between ticks\n\nAnd there is romance in the slow dances because\n\nThey’re fertile in hush, futile in haste\n\nThese are your nerves, this is how they taste\n\n\n\nWell I can’t count how many times I’ve been outdone by nihilism\n\nJoined the march that splits an open heart into a schism\n\nI cower at the thought of other people’s expectations\n\nAnd yet still hand over mine to them\n\n\n\nTravel where you are, tourism is sin\n\nThese are the ruins we left behind, you can’t take pictures of them\n\nIf what they say is true, then you become what you chew\n\nIf it decays spit it out, affectation is a drought\n\nThat you wait through when you hate everything that you do\n\nYou wanna live outside the groove, then fine\n\nBut it’s there like a flower blooming in your ear\n\nOpen up your mouths, pollinate your peers\n\n\n\nNothing reminds the mind of power like the cheap odor of plastic leaking fumes\n\nWe crave, consume, the rush it feels fantastic\n\nBut like power turns to mold, like a junkie going cold\n\nI need the fix of a little tenderness"
