  "lyrics": "They are master and slave.\r\nWe are sunlight and shadow.\r\nAll roads to the river.\r\nI am lost. I am saved.\r\nI'm beloved and betrayed.\r\nAll roads to the river.\n\n\n\nAnd the river runs wide,\n\nAnd the river runs deep\n\nAnd I spit in the eye\n\nOf safe company.\n\nWhen I dive right down\n\nTo the undertow\n\nWell, the deeper I drown\n\nLord, the higher I'll go.\n\n\n\nI am whispering dreams.\n\nI am howling revolutions.\n\nAll roads to the river.\n\nI am valentine sweet\n\nAnd I live in this nightmare.\n\nAll roads to the river.\n\nAnd the river runs wide,\n\nThe river runs deep\n\nAnd I spit in the eye\n\nOf safe company.\n\nWhen I dive right down\n\nTo the undertow\n\nWell, the deeper I drown\n\nLord, the higher I'll go.\n\n\n\nThis is nothing like we planned.\n\nThat's the way it's always been.\n\nAll roads to the river.\n\nI have hated and I have loved.\n\nI have prayed and I have sinned.\n\nAll roads to the river.\n\n\n\nAnd the river runs wide,\n\nThe river runs deep\n\nAnd I spit in the eye\n\nOf safe company.\n\nWhen I dive right down\n\nTo the undertow\n\nWell, the deeper I drown\n\nLord, the higher I'll go"
