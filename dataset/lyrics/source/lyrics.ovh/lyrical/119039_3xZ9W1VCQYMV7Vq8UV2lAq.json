Baby, what can I do?\n\nThe monster in me loves the monster in you\n\nHold me\n\nSqueeze a little tighter 'til we can't breathe\n\nWhat can I say, baby, what can I do?\n\nThe monster in me loves the monster in you\n\n\n\nMonster in me, mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy\n\nLoves the monster in you, mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy\n\n\n\nBeautiful killer, cut me deep\n\nJust a single kiss and I'm in your spell\n\nBoy, you go in like I never seen\n\nBeautiful fire, love the heat, mmm\n\nEvery night we fight and it's hot like hell\n\nBut I love the way that you make me scream\n\n\n\nAnd every time I let go\n\nI cry and I beg for more, more\n\n\n\nTouch me\n\nWhy don't we kill each other slowly?\n\nWhat can I say? Baby, what can I do?\n\nThe monster in me loves the monster in you\n\nHold me\n\nSqueeze a little tighter 'til we can't breathe (Can't breathe, baby)\n\nWhat can I say? Baby, what can I do?\n\nThe monster in me loves the monster in you\n\n\n\nMonster in me, mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy\n\nLoves the monster in you, mmm, mmm, ayy, ayy (Hey, yeah)\n\n\n\nEvery moment we spend\n\nTurning from friends to enemies\n\nAnd fighting to hold on to each other\n\nEvery second we fall to fire below\n\nIt's so beautiful\n\nThe hell that we both made for each other\n\n(But it's all love and war)\n\nLouder we roar\n\n(Crying for more)\n\nI know it's so wrong, but baby, just\n\n\n\nTouch me\n\nWhy don't we kill each other slowly? Yeah\n\nWhat can I say? Baby, what can I do? Oh\n\nThe monster in me loves the monster in you, babe\n\nHold me\n\nSqueeze a little tighter 'til we can't breathe (I can't breathe)\n\nWhat can I say? Oh, what can I do, baby?\n\nThe monster in me loves the monster in you\n\nThe monster in me, yeah\n\n\n\nWanting me, haunting you\n\nHaunting me, haunting you\n\nOh, wanting me, haunting you, oh\n\nHaunting me, haunting you\n\nOoh, wanting me, haunting you\n\nHaunting me, haunting you\n\nOoh, wanting me, haunting you\n\nHaunting me"
