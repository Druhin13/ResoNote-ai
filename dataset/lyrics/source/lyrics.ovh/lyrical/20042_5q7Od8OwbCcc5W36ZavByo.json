  "lyrics": "Turn your back in a forfeit way\r\nTake out loans no one could pay\r\nThis reddish glint it gleams on black\r\nClings like piranhas to your back\n\nIs this that trivial to you\n\nIt's not impossible to lose your grip\n\nIt's foolish things that people do\n\nI understand I'm guilty too\n\n\n\nIf only for a moment I could stop the wheels from spinning\n\nWould everything I've broken finally start to feel forgiving\n\nYou think all those things are worth your while\n\nAre they waiting or just startin’ to pile up\n\nIf only for a moment I could stop the wheels from spinning\n\n\n\nIt's so informal at the seams\n\nRemains too difficult to reach\n\nFeels like it clogs my arteries\n\nAs we get stuck somewhere between\n\nI'm not suggesting we give in\n\nOr reconsider where we've been\n\nThis distance seems so commonplace\n\nApologizing to save face\n\nTo save face\n\nIf only for a moment I could stop the wheels from spinning\n\nWould everything I've broken finally start to feel forgiving\n\nYou think all those things are worth your while\n\nAre they waiting or just startin’ to pile up\n\nIf only for a moment I could stop the wheels from spinning"
