  "lyrics": "You’re asking the questions but not listening to the answers you get\r\nThat must be hard to do\r\nIt must be about as hard as forgetting your best friends\r\nYou said we’d leave no one behind\r\nTo prove what you had wasn’t dead inside\r\nBut we know, yeah, everyone knows what a selfish prick you’ve become\n\n\n\nI remember when one single moment was enough to convince yourself to jump in because you wanted to\n\nIt’s not that far, at least it didn’t seem so from down there\n\nBut from up here it seems that everything I love is so far away\n\nThere used to be many things that I could hold and touch and grab onto in stormy weather\n\nThese days we have each other\n\n(These days)\n\n\n\nDid you honestly think anything would be different this time around\n\nI’m sure you’ve got a reason and it’s profound\n\nBelieve anything as long as it never lets you down\n\n\n\nI remember when one single moment was enough to convince yourself to jump in because you wanted to\n\nIt’s not that far, at least it didn’t seem so from down there\n\nBut from up here it seems that everything I love is so far away\n\nThere used to be many things that I could hold and touch and grab onto in stormy weather\n\nThese days we have each other\n\n(These days)\n\n\n\nBut we know, yeah, everyone knows what a selfish prick you’ve become\n\n\n\nAnd we all feel love for a moment\n\nAnd we all get heard together\n\n\n\n'Cause I remember when one single moment was enough to convince yourself to jump in because you wanted to\n\nIt’s not that far, at least it didn’t seem so from down there\n\nBut from up here it seems that everything I love is so far away\n\nThere used to be many things that I could hold and touch and grab onto in stormy weather\n\nThese days we have each other\n\n(These days)"
