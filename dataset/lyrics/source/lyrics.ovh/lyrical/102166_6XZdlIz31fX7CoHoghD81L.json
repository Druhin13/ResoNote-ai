  "lyrics": "If you're gonna run then you better run fast\r\nI've always been told that the good can never last\r\nOnly the sky above me and the water below\r\nTough further from you than ever before\r\nSo I wait to break each memory down as they pass by\r\nWe've both made our mistakes\n\nAnd I know that there is no telling why\n\n\n\nI've had dreams of where this life of mine could lead\n\nPictured stormy romances and heroic deeds\n\nI've never thought I'd end up where I am\n\nIf I know anything it's nothing goes as planned\n\nNow the sun's coming up\n\nThe world spins on the same old song\n\nI'm still here, I miss my feet\n\nWith nothing to fall back upon\n\n\n\nWhat if this is all that we get\n\nAll that is deal to us\n\nThen is that really not enough?\n\nThere are many places to go\n\nFaces we'll never know\n\nBut I got you and that's enough\n\nThat's more than enough\n\n\n\nI'm tired of looking for truth or answers\n\nKnow who seems to be found\n\nAs to where I'm bound\n\nWhere I'm bound\n\n\n\nIf you're gonna run then you better run fast\n\nI've always been told that the good can never last\n\n\n\nBut if this is all that we get\n\nAll that is deal to us\n\nThen is that really not enough?\n\nThere are many places to go\n\nFaces we'll never know\n\nBut I got you and that's enough\n\nThat's more than enough"
