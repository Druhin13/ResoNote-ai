Baby won’t you love me?\n\nBaby won’t you trust me? Tell me where did we go wrong\n\nDon’t put no one above me, baby don’t you crush me\n\nThese feelings got me bubbly, tell me can you play our song?\n\nCan you play along? She riding right or wrong\n\nI tell her hit my phone, whenever I’m alone\n\nShe say she like my tone, I tell her baby we drunk\n\nTell her baby come home, can’t wait to get you alone\n\nOh, oh, I cannot walk outside because I am known\n\nI put my headphones on, now I’m in my zone\n\nCannot trust these bitches, they are some clones\n\nThey tuning in like I’m an episode\n\n\n\nI’ve been in the backseat, thinking about you and me\n\nBaby all night long, where did we go wrong?\n\nWhere do the stars go, when the morning comes?\n\nI’ve been in the backseat, been moving very fast\n\nI’m staring out the window, watching the world rush by\n\nWatching you fall behind, from the backseat of my mind\n\n\n\nI’m missing your material, love it’s so imperial\n\nBub is when they hearing you, loving how I’m feeling you\n\nLoving every bit of you, I cannot get rid of you\n\nTell me what you wanna do, you just came up out the blue\n\nTell me what went wrong, I’m screaming on a song\n\nWe never got along, you lost me now I’m gone\n\nWe hitting like a bong, we never got along\n\nYour playing all alone, so tell me what’s wrong\n\nYeah I don’t wanna play, you feeling down, a rainy day\n\nGo from LA back to the A, now I can’t conversate\n\nUnless I’m talking to my babe, I’m in the backseat feeling great\n\n\n\nI’ve been in the backseat, thinking about you and me\n\nBaby all night long, where did we go wrong?\n\nNow every time you touch me, it doesn’t feel as strong, as it used to!\n\n\n\nI’ve been in the backseat, thinking about you and me\n\nBaby all night long, where did we go wrong?\n\nWhere do the stars go, when the morning comes?\n\nI’ve been in the backseat, been moving very fast\n\nI’m staring out the window, watching the world rush by\n\nWatching you fall behind, from the backseat of my mind\n\n\n\nFrom the backseat of my mind\n\nFrom the backseat of my mind\n\nFrom the backseat of my mind\n\nFrom the backseat of my mind\n\nFrom the backseat of my mind\n\nYeah, ooo, muah!"
