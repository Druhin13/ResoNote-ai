  "lyrics": "Mad, mad at you\r\nMad, mad at you\r\nMad, mad at you\r\nMad, mad at you\r\nWe need to talk, you just say, \"I don't want to start a fight\"\n\nBut the minute gets to my lips, I can feel my tongue is tied\n\nAnd my eyes start to water but I can't stop you when you lie\n\nBaby, we need to talk 'cause I think that is time I walk away\n\nBefore you start calling my name\n\n'Cause when you start begging me to stay\n\n\n\nIt's gonna be hard as hell\n\nAnd baby, you know me well\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nI can never be mad at you\n\nAnd you only love yourself\n\nFor me there's no one else\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nI can never be mad, mad, mad at you\n\nMad, mad at you\n\n\n\nBaby, you were the one who convinced me to run into your arms\n\nOh, but now that you got me, it's easy to want another love\n\nThinking that you'll find a better one\n\nAnd now sit here waiting until you're done\n\n\n\nIt's gonna be hard as hell\n\nAnd baby, you know me well\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nI can never be mad at you\n\nAnd you only love yourself\n\nFor me there's no one else\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nI can never be mad, mad, mad at you\n\nMad, mad at you"
