  "lyrics": "Here I am, 12AM\r\nSunk in deep to my bed\r\nKept alive by the light of the moon\r\nClose my eyes, but my mind\r\nGot its own plan tonight\r\nAnd it keeps rubbing salt in the wound\n\n\n\nI know it’s too late, as night turns to day\n\nNow there’s no escaping the ghosts\n\n\n\nI, I can’t shake these midnight thoughts when I’m alone\n\nLatching to my brain and never letting go\n\nSo I start making friends with the noise in my head\n\nAnd all these midnight thoughts when I’m alone\n\n\n\nOooh, oooh\n\n\n\nDim the lights, shut the blinds\n\nBut I’m counting the time\n\nAm I nervous or am I insane?\n\nTry to turn up the sound\n\nBut I can’t shut it out\n\nCause I’m hearing the pulse in my veins\n\n\n\nI know it’s too late, as night turns to day\n\nNow there’s no escaping the ghosts\n\n\n\nCause I can’t shake these midnight thoughts when I’m alone\n\nLatching to my brain and never letting go\n\nSo I start making friends with the noise in my head\n\nAnd all these midnight thoughts when I’m alone\n\n\n\nOooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\n\n(Cause I can’t shake these midnight thoughts when I’m alone)\n\n\n\nI know it’s too late, as night turns to day\n\nNow there’s no escaping the ghosts\n\n\n\nCause I can’t shake these midnight thoughts when I’m alone\n\nLatching to my brain and never letting go\n\nSo I start making friends with the noise in my head\n\nAnd all these midnight thoughts when I’m alone\n\n\n\nOooh, oooh, oooh, oooh\n\n\n\nSo I start making friends with the noise in my head\n\nAnd all these midnight thoughts when I’m alone (With these thoughts)\n\nWith all these midnight thoughts when I’m alone"
