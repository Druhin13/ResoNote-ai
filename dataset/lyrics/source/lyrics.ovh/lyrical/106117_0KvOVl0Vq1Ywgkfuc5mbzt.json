  "lyrics": "Silence keeps your glory, a prisoner locked in chains\r\nWhile there's a fire deep inside of me\r\nSorrow stirred by failure, piece I've kept restrained\r\nI am nothing without God to give my praise\r\nWalking as a shadow, riches without wait\n\nLike misty mornings, lifting off the sea\n\nMake me know the meaning, the ending of my days\n\nTo feel without you how frail I am indeed\n\n\n\nHolding my breath, what am I waiting for\n\nIt's out of my hands, all that I have is yours\n\nHolding me back, who am I living for\n\nIt's out of my hands, all that I have is yours\n\n\n\nCreation gives its glory to the one who made all things\n\nNow my desire is only for the same\n\nReaching to the heavens, like branches on a tree\n\nI shout like thunder, crashing like the waves\n\n\n\nHolding my breath, what am I waiting for\n\nIt's out of my hands, all that I have is yours\n\nWhat's holding me back, who am I living for\n\nIt's out of my hands, all that I have is yours\n\n\n\nMy song will rise (all that I have is yours, all that I have is yours)\n\nMy hands will rise (all that I have\n\nis yours, all that I have is yours)\n\nMy song will rise (all that I have is yours, all that I have is yours)\n\nMy hands will rise (all that I have\n\nis yours, all that I have is yours)\n\n\n\nDeath and darkness flee out westward from the lines\n\nAll my skeletons have nowhere left to hide\n\nMy path will follow the sun\n\nShining brighter 'til the hour has come\n\n\n\nNow my path will follow the sun\n\nShining brighter 'til the hour has come"
