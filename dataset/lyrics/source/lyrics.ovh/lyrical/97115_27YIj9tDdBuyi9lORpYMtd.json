  "lyrics": "Think I finally get your message\r\nYou won't just let me go and let you down\r\nI'm one that knows bad decisions, huh\r\nAnd that keeps changing your mind around\r\nAnd two is a company, three is a crowd\n\nOne keeps me grounded, and one in the clouds\n\nContradicting the things I thought I knew\n\nSo indecisive, don't know what to do\n\n\n\n'Cause I want you, and you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me wanting you?\n\nAnd you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me?\n\nI want you\n\n\n\nI'm still trying to break some habits (Habits)\n\nSometimes I'm choosy or greedy or both\n\nDon't we all come with some baggage? (Baggage)\n\nAnd I know I got more than most\n\n\n\nWe both know two is a company, three is a crowd\n\nSo far from grounded, and close to the clouds\n\nContradicting the things I thought I knew\n\nSo indecisive, it's so hard to choose\n\n\n\n'Cause I want you, and you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me wanting you?\n\nAnd you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me?\n\n'Cause I want you, and you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me wanting you?\n\nAnd you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me?\n\n\n\nYou know I like my options\n\nI be switchin' and swappin'\n\nPlatinum, baby, no floppin'\n\nBubblegum, you poppin'\n\nSwitchin' up my logo\n\nUp and down like pogo\n\nShow you off, that's promo\n\nAlways happens like slow-mo\n\nI know, I know, I know, I know, I know\n\nWe both, we both got places we could go\n\nAnd whether or not to stay, or turn and walk away\n\nThe way I feel will never change\n\n\n\nI want you, and you, and you, and you, and you (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me wanting you?\n\nAnd you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really choose?\n\nI want you, and you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me wanting you?\n\nAnd you, and you, and you too (You-ou-ou)\n\nCan you really blame me?\n\n\n\nYou know I like my options\n\nI be switchin' and swappin'\n\nYou know I like my options"
