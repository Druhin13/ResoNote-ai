  "lyrics": "Sittin' here on this lonely dock\r\nWatch the rain play on the ocean top\r\nAll the things I feel I need to say\r\nI can't explain in any other way\r\nI need to be bold \n\nNeed to jump in the cold water\n\nNeed to grow older with a girl like you\n\nFinally see you were naturally\n\nThe one to make it so easy when you showed me the truth\n\nYeah, yeah I'd rather be with you\n\nSay you want the same thing too\n\n\n\nNow here's the sun come to dry the rain\n\nWarm my shoulders and relieve my pain\n\nYou're the one thing that I'm missing here\n\nWith you beside me I no longer fear\n\n\n\nI need to be bold \n\nNeed to jump in the cold water\n\nNeed to grow older with a girl like you\n\nFinally see you were naturally\n\nThe one to make it so easy when you showed me the truth\n\nYeah, yeah I'd rather be with you\n\nSay you want the same thing too\n\n\n\nI could have saved so much time for us\n\nHad I seen the way to get to where I am today\n\nYou waited on me for so long\n\nSo now listen to me say\n\n\n\nI need to be bold \n\nNeed to jump in the cold water\n\nNeed to grow older with a girl like you\n\nFinally see you were naturally\n\nThe one to make it so easy when you showed me the truth\n\nYeah, yeah I'd rather be with you\n\nSay you want the same thing too\n\n\n\nSay you feel the way I do"
