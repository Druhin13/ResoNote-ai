  "lyrics": "I know you, I need you,\r\nI had you, did I let you down?\r\nYou come and you go,\r\nI wait but never really know,\r\nMhm, did I ever know?\n\nDon't let me down,\n\nDon't you let me down.\n\nOn and on, even the good die young,\n\nHeavy hands, scupper the best laid plans,\n\nOn and on, ever the foolish one,\n\nWho says what he wants,\n\nBut he wants what he can't understand.\n\n\n\nUnfolding, strung out,\n\nI'm holding on, you're holding out.\n\n(mhhmm)\n\nDon't kiss me, don't lie,\n\nYou ask for freedom then you cry,\n\nOh, did I ever lie?\n\n\n\nDon't let me down,\n\nDon't you let me down.\n\nOn and on, even the good die young,\n\nHeavy hands, scupper the best laid plans,\n\nOn and on, ever the foolish one,\n\nWho says what he wants,\n\nBut he wants what he can't understand.\n\n\n\nDon't let me down,\n\nDon't let me down.\n\nDon't let me down,\n\nDon't you let me down.\n\nDon't let me down,\n\nDon't let me down."
