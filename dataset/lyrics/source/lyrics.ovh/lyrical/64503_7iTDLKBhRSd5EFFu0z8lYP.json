  "lyrics": "Everyone knows, ears to the ground\r\nThe daily drag finds the Oakland sky\r\nTrench foot first and the spirit alive\r\nFeel for the dawn, find the unbroken sound\r\nIt can only get better from here\n\nDon't have any fear\n\n\n\nThe universal key turns the whole man to his kind\n\nPhosphate skin as the fall birds fly\n\nEvolution will make a mess out of you\n\nTryin' to find love in the sewer of subterania\n\n\n\nIt can only get better from here\n\nDon't have any fear\n\n\n\nThe daily drag makes you stronger\n\nThe daily drag makes you stronger\n\nMakes you stronger\n\n\n\nEver been a witness, ruinous in the morning\n\nBut the caged bird does sing a deeper blues\n\nEver seen the road less traveled and wondered\n\nThe best is with them, not with you Where you been?\n\n\n\nIt can only get better from here\n\nDon't have any fear"
