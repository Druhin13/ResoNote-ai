  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Where Lie the Gods par Primordial\r\nWhat desolate walls are these\nThat rise up from the ruins\nHymns to a forgotten age\nin centuries of strong sleep\nWhat sieges, storms and fire\nhave they resisted in the deep\n\nWhere lie the tomb of Gods\nTongues of the occident\nTheir magic is hidden in shame\nResting entombed within these ancient halls\n\nThou, Sail on, O' ship of fate\nSail on so strong and great\nHumanity with all it's fears\nWith all the hopes of future years\n\nis hanging breathless on thy fate\n\nWhere lie the Gods of old\nmen and women who fell from peace\nThe battle has carved another season\non a haggard and defeated face"
