  "lyrics": "I've been working on this music shit since I was 16\r\nHad to cut off all my friends for it, they don’t miss me\r\nHow ironic, how could I have been so dumb\r\nNo fakes, I could never be the one\r\nAnd now they see me pulling up in my fuckin' whip\r\nYeah I'm right where the function is\n\nYeah they used to never fuck with this\n\nNow they hitting me up, ask for racks up on my phone\n\nI just hit the signs, turn the volume up on bones\n\n21 guns, hit the lighters by the kerosene\n\nIf I die, know my brothers couldn’t bury me\n\nI just hope I got enough left for my family\n\nGame changed, I no longer let 'em carry me\n\nI look around and everybody look like droids (look like droids)\n\nThey the demons, just some noise\n\nTry to fight it but I'm lying to myself as if I got a fuckin' choice\n\nNo point, I'm just screamin' in the voids, yuh\n\n\n\nOverdosed twice, made it through some bad times\n\nAlways out here playing with the reaper then I cut ties\n\nLiving out of cars, cause I couldn't pay the rent\n\nOut of cars but flipping coins like my name is Harvey Dent\n\nYeah my family doesn't fuck with all the shit that I’m doing\n\nCause to them a 9 to 5’s the only job worth pursuing\n\nNormalcy is fuckin' trash compared to what I got brewing\n\nTried to make it singing, but I guess the raps what I’m doing\n\n21 guns, hit the face if you don't fuck with me\n\nIf I don't fuck with you, move carefully\n\nUsed to be a fucking joke and now they scared of me\n\nKnocking on my door but they were never there for me\n\n\n\n21 guns, hit the lighters by the kerosene\n\nIf I die, know my brothers couldn't bury me\n\nI just hope I got enough left for my family\n\nGame changed, I no longer let ’em carry me"
