  "lyrics": "When I get off of this mountain\r\nYou know where I want to go\r\nStraight down the Mississippi River\r\nTo the Gulf of Mexico\r\nTo Lake George, Louisiana\n\nLittle Bessie, girl that I once knew\n\nAnd she told me just to come on by\n\nIf there's anything she could do\n\n\n\nUp on Cripple Creek, she sends me\n\nIf I spring a leak, she mends me\n\nI don't have to speak, she defends me\n\nA drunkard's dream if I ever did see one\n\n\n\nGood luck had just stung me\n\nTo the race track I did go\n\nShe bet on one horse to win\n\nAnd I bet on another to show\n\n\n\nOdds were in my favor\n\nI had him five to one\n\nWhen that nag came around the track\n\nSure enough we had won\n\n\n\nUp on Cripple Creek, she sends me\n\nIf I spring a leak, she mends me\n\nI don't have to speak, she defends me\n\nA drunkard's dream if I ever did see one\n\n\n\nI took up all of my winnings\n\nAnd I gave my little Bessie half\n\nAnd she tore it up and blew it in my face\n\nJust for a laugh\n\n\n\nNow there's one thing in the whole wide world\n\nI sure would like to see\n\nThat's when that little love of mine\n\nDips her doughnut in my tea\n\n\n\nUp on Cripple Creek, she sends me\n\nIf I spring a leak, she mends me\n\nI don't have to speak, she defends me\n\nA drunkard's dream if I ever did see one\n\n\n\nNow me and my mate were back at the shack\n\nWe had Spike Jones on the box\n\nShe said, \"I can't take the way he sings\n\nBut I love to hear him talk\"\n\n\n\nNow that just gave my heart a fall\n\nTo the bottom of my feet\n\nAnd I swore and I took another pull\n\nMy Bessie can't be beat\n\n\n\nUp on Cripple Creek, she sends me\n\nIf I spring a leak, she mends me\n\nI don't have to speak, she defends me\n\nA drunkard's dream if I ever did see one\n\n\n\nAs a flood out in California\n\nAnd up north it's freezing cold\n\nAnd this living off the road\n\nIs getting pretty old\n\n\n\nSo I guess I'll call up my big mama\n\nTell her I'll be rolling in\n\nBut you know, deep down, I'm kinda tempted\n\nTo go and see my sweet Bessie again\n\n\n\nUp on Cripple Creek, she sends me\n\nIf I spring a leak, she mends me\n\nI don't have to speak, she defends me\n\nA drunkard's dream if I ever did see one"
