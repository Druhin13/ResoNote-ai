  "lyrics": "So here we go again\r\nI know how this one ends\r\nIt's a phone call from someplace far away\r\nYou say you've found yourself\r\nOh, in someone else\r\nAnd she makes you forget about the rain\n\n\n\nHer eyes are a golden hue\n\nAnd everything you knew\n\nSlips away at the hem of her dress\n\nAs I was passing by that old mountainside\n\nIt turned to dust at my feet\n\nSo I am incomplete\n\nSo loud, and so discreet\n\nYou tried to pinpoint me\n\nI guess that was your mistake\n\nToo much whiskey\n\nToo much honey, too much wine\n\nI learned some things never heal with time\n\n\n\nAnd I've been waitin' here\n\nFeels like a million years\n\nAnd I'm a photograph that you forgot you took\n\nBut I remember spring\n\nI remember everything\n\nOh, I guess that's the way it goes\n\n\n\n(Here we go!)\n\nLa-da-da-da-da-da\n\nLa-da-da-da-da-da\n\nLa-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da"
