Hoe address it\n\n\n\nReal bitches to the square, I’m speaking for the boss bitches\n\nAnd not you hoes that be fucking for half\n\nBut my dog outside, if it’s a nigga I drive\n\nTo a nigga I lie!\n\nSpiffy hoes better wake up! And get your motherfucking cake up\n\nOr get smoked like a Grape Dutch\n\nIs you fucking for a stack, bitch it ain’t much\n\nIt’s a drought ‘round here, pussy went up\n\nNow my feelings on E, I need to fill up\n\nA new Benz, just to sit up, condo on a beach just to kick up\n\nI cut a check, we could split up\n\n\n\nI’m already gooking, on my period, pmsing\n\nAnd my nigga fucking on me, and I’m stressing\n\nHaters tryna knock me for the shit that I’m blessed with, period\n\nYou got a problem? Hoe address it\n\n\n\nMy nigga acting crazy, I’m ‘bout to get rid of his baby\n\nHis mama acting shady, his sister tryna spray me\n\nHis homeboys wanna fuck me\n\nAnd every bitch in the hood wanna fuck him, because me\n\nI ain’t got time for these niggas, cause these niggas ain’t nothing\n\nI ain’t tryna figure out, who he sucking and fucking\n\nBitch I got other shit to stress about\n\nMy bills late, money running out\n\nPull up, them stoves, bitch are running out\n\nI gotta get it by any means\n\nAnd keep my enemy’s close, cause these other hoes only switch teams\n\nWhen I’m in the field, just know I play for keeps\n\nKeep my grass cut, so these bitches won’t creep\n\n\n\nI’m already gooking, on my period, pmsing\n\nAnd my nigga fucking on me, and I’m stressing\n\nHaters tryna knock me for the shit that I’m blessed with, period\n\nYou got a problem? Hoe address it"
