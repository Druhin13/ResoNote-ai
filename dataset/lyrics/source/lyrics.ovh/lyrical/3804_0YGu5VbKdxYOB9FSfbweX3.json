  "lyrics": "Hoping for a miracle\r\nI'm not equipped for this, but I can't move until I choose\r\nI need a crystal ball\r\nI'm falling apart and I can't take anymore\r\nStanding at the crossroads\r\nThere's no right answer, no one's brain to pick\n\nUnder the spy\n\nThere's no escaping, I'm a deer caught in headlights\n\n\n\nI am hoping for a sign\n\nSomething bring me right here\n\nNot in a drink, not in a drift\n\nPlease see me through metaphors in blue\n\nI'm holding on for dear life\n\n\n\nEgo, I am a slave to you\n\nYou're running the show, my confidence is bruised\n\nDumbstruck, I'm falling further\n\nDown a shame spiral, I am left in this\n\n\n\nI am hoping for a sign\n\nSomething bring me right here\n\nNot in a drink, not in a drift\n\nPlease see me through metaphors in blue\n\nI'm holding on for dear life\n\n\n\nSomething bring me right here\n\nNot in a drink, not in a drift\n\nPlease see me through metaphors in blue\n\nI'm holding on for dear life\n\n\n\nSpirit\n\nPlease don't abandon me"
