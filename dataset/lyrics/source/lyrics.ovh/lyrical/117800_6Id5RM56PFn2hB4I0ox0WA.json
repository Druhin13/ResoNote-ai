  "lyrics": "One, two, three\r\nI'm alone in my house\r\nI'm out on the town\r\nI'm at the bottom of the bottle\r\nI'm there knockin' them down\n\n\n\nI can't get back up on my feet\n\nSee the lights all on the streetlights stars\n\n\n\nBut look what I found\n\nLook what I found\n\nAnother piece of my heart\n\nJust laying on the ground\n\n\n\nAnother foggy day\n\nI’m looking for a light\n\nAnd my only prayer is working tonight\n\n\n\nI can’t get myself out of bed\n\nHear these voices in my head like a song\n\n\n\nBut look what I found\n\n(Somebody who loves me)\n\nLook what I found\n\n(Somebody who carries)\n\nAround a piece of my heart\n\nJust laying on the ground\n\n\n\nWhen I met you I was blown to pieces\n\nHeart all over the floor\n\nEver since you put me back together\n\nI can’t believe it, can’t believe it\n\n\n\nLook what you found, yeah, baby\n\nLook what I found\n\nSomeone who carries around a piece of my heart\n\nLook what I found, woo, c'mon\n\nLook what I found\n\nSomebody who loves me\n\nLook what we found\n\nSomeone who carries around a piece of my heart, heart\n\nJust laying on the ground"
