  "lyrics": "I was just a poor young little ugly thing\r\nMomma kicked me out, just shy of 17\r\nI was lookin' for love, in the fire, in the flames\r\nBut the only way to love, is to get yourself burned\r\nThat's how I became the runaway\n\nI gave my hand to a man, he put the ring on me\n\nHe couldn't understand why he wasn't just like me\n\nI should've known by the look in his eyes\n\nWe looked at the same guys\n\nThat's when I realized\n\n\n\nNo hands will hold me\n\nI'll always be lonely\n\nIs there someone out there who can break\n\nThis habit of going\n\nThere's no way of knowing\n\nI promise I'll always be a little runaway\n\nYour little runaway\n\n\n\nIf you're not careful, you'll get your heart broken\n\nTake me as an example, I'll be a token\n\nI used to fall head over feet\n\nBut everyone I loved deceived me\n\nSo, what choice does that leave\n\nA runaway\n\n\n\nYou could say my shadow is the only friend of mine\n\nBut it gets pretty lonely in the nighttime\n\nMy shadow is almost as hard to see, oh\n\nAlmost as hard as it is to love me\n\nA runaway\n\n\n\nNo hands will hold me\n\nI'll always be lonely\n\nIs there someone out there who can break\n\nThis habit of going\n\nThere's no way of knowing\n\nI promise I'll always be a little runaway\n\nI'll be a runaway"
