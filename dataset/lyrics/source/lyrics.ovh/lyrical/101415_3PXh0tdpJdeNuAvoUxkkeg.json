  "lyrics": "Windmills are turning, I'm running in place within you\r\nI intertwine my soul right in the line that you drew\r\nI pull up a chair, plant my feet on the ground to your view\r\nWhile something starts turning, our past turns into present truth\r\nYou had me feeling up there\n\nI had you feeling up there\n\nOh, feeling up there\n\nYou got me feeling up there\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm thinking \"Please stay\"\n\nWhen I speak you don't sway\n\nWhen I need you big time, it's enough\n\nI can't just break out from the loop\n\nAnd I'm just thinking \"Please stay\"\n\nI'm here and I'm running to get you\n\nSo come let me get you\n\n\n\nSomething left burning, half broken [?]\n\nOpen the door to a thought I just hit and repeat\n\nI pull up a chair, plant my feet on the ground to your view\n\nWhile something starts turning, our past turns into present truth\n\n\n\nYou had me feeling up there\n\nI had you feeling up there\n\nOh, feeling up there\n\nYou got me feeling up there\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm thinking \"Please stay\"\n\nWhen I speak you don't sway\n\nAnd I'm thinking big time, it's enough\n\nI can't just break out from the loop\n\nAnd now I'm just thinking \"Please stay\"\n\nSo now I'm just thinking \"Please stay\"\n\nI need you, I need you\n\nAnd when I speak you don't sway\n\nWhen I need you big time, it's enough\n\nI can't just break out from the loop, ooh\n\n'Cause now I'm thinking \"Please stay\"\n\nI'm here and I'm running to get you\n\nSo come let me get you"
