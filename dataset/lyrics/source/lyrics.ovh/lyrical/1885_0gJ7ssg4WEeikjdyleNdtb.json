  "lyrics": "When did we get so lost inside ourselves?\r\nWe used to be strong, now it's like we don't care\r\nInstead we're calling out for help\r\nDon't know where we went wrong, but it's so hard to share\r\nAll this weight left on our shoulders\n\nToo much for the both of us\n\n\n\nWhen did it get so heavy?\n\nThis love that's in between us\n\nWe never used to feel this\n\nFeels so heavy\n\nCan't get up off the ground\n\nIt's weighing us down\n\n\n\nWhen did we get so bad at being honest?\n\nYou got things on your mind, that you don't wanna say\n\nThought that we had made a promise\n\nThat we would never get this way\n\n\n\nBut all this weight left on our shoulders\n\nToo much for the both of us\n\n\n\nWhen did it get so heavy?\n\nThis love that's in between us\n\nIt never used to feel this\n\nFeels so heavy\n\nCan't get up off the ground\n\nIt's weighing us down\n\n\n\nAll these things we said that we never meant\n\nAre we gonna let them hold us down?\n\nAll these things we said that we never meant\n\nAre we gonna let them hold us down?\n\n(Down)\n\n\n\n'Cause baby it's too heavy\n\nThis love that's in between us\n\nWe never used to feel this\n\nFeels so heavy\n\nCan't get up off, can't get up off the ground\n\nIt's weighing us down, down, down\n\n(Na na na na no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\nSo heavy)\n\nWhen did it get so, when did it get so heavy?"
