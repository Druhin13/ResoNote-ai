  "lyrics": "I'm so tired but I can't sleep\r\nToo many obligations I'm trying to keep\r\nGotta please everybody except for myself\r\nBut like Levon said, \"Ain't in it for my health\"\r\nEverybody thinks it's all work and no fun\n\nBut a little pain never hurt anyone\n\nA little pain never hurt anyone\n\n\n\nWhen I come I home, I've gotta leave\n\nMy reality is only make-believe\n\nSomeone said it's one or the other\n\nBut I'm breaking my back and working like a mother\n\nWho's to say just how it's done?\n\n\n\nAnd a little pain never hurt anyone\n\nA little pain never hurt anyone\n\nA little pain never hurt anyone\n\n\n\nBaby, slow down, better hurry up quick\n\nI feel so good that it's making me sick\n\nAnd I didn't mean to call your phone\n\nI said, I like you the best when I'm all alone\n\nIt's been real but I gotta run\n\n\n\nAnd a little pain never hurt anyone\n\nA little pain never hurt anyone\n\nA little pain never hurt anyone\n\nA little pain, a little pain never hurt anyone"
