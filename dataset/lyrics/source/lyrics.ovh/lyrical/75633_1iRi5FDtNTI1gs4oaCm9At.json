  "lyrics": "We were more than lovers,\nWe were more than sweethearts,\nIt's so hard to understand.\n\nDon't know why it happened,\nDon't know how it started,\n\nWhy should we be strangers,\n\nAfter all we planned.\n\n\n\nI can't show my face,\n\nCan't go anyplace,\n\nPeople stop an' stare,\n\nIt's so hard to bear,\n\nEverybody knows you left me,\n\nIt's the talk of the town\n\n\n\nEvery time we meet,\n\nMy heart skips a beat,\n\nWe don't stop to speak,\n\n'Though it's just a week,\n\nEverybody knows you left me,\n\nIt's the talk of the town\n\n\n\nWe send out invitations,\n\nTo friends and relations,\n\nAnnouncing our weddin' day\n\nFriends and our relations,\n\nGave congratulations,\n\nHow can you face them?\n\nWhat can you say?\n\n\n\nLet's make up sweetheart,\n\nWe can't stay apart,\n\nDon't let foolish pride,\n\nKeep you from my side,\n\nHow can love like ours be ended?\n\nIt's the talk of the town\n\nHow can you face them?\n\n\n\nWhat can you say?\n\n\n\nLet's make up sweetheart,\n\nWe can't stay apart,\n\nDon't let foolish pride,\n\nKeep you from my side,\n\nHow can love like ours be ended?\n\nIt's the talk of the town, hm\n\n\n\nIt's the talk of the town."
