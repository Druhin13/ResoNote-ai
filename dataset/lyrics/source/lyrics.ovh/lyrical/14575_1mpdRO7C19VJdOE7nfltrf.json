  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Guinea Pig par Girls In Hawaii\r\nI wake up in a cave\nYou’re by my side\nI see the chandeliers gleam\nA thousand lights\nPicture on the wall\nOf ‘96\nYou and I\nJust smiling\nLike monkeys\n\nSo I go swimming\nTo wake me up\nI’m floating with no shape, no conscience\nI look across the room\nAnd see the girl\nLooks like a Greek old-fashioned sculpture\n\nJust wait outside\nI’ll be there\n\nYou gave me some advice\nSo I owe you now\nIt must be hard for you to lend to me\nThis golden sky\nInfinite desire\nYou show me now\nWhere are the smiles and laughs again\nMy inner child\n\nI’m not here again\nWith you aside\nI only see the black blue teeth\nMarked on the back\nPicture on the wall\nOf '86\n\nThere's only me but much younger\nStraight on appear\n\nYou gave me some advice\nSo I owe you now\nIt must be hard for you to lend to me\nThis golden sky\nInfinite desire\nYou show me now\nWhere are the smiles and laughs again\nMy inner child\n\nYou gave me some advice\nSo I owe you now\nIt must be hard for you to lend to me\nThis golden sky\nInfinite desire\nYou show me now\n\nWhere are the smiles and laughs again\nMy inner child"
