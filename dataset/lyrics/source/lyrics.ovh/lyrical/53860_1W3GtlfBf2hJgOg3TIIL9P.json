  "lyrics": "I walked around alone last night\r\nand tried to look at people like I did back then\r\nI kinda wanted to just hang out\r\nremind myself what it was all about\r\nabout everything I thought\r\nI shattered and left laying there\n\nthat didn't matter\n\nevery now and then comes back to my eyes\n\nmoving in a new direction\n\nI know if you're not getting better\n\nyou're getting worse but\n\nwatching everybody else it's getting harder to remind myself\n\nof what I've learned relying on another lame religion\n\nto validate our arrogant traditions\n\nand any day we're gonna wonder why\n\nwe've been left behind\n\nthis girl came up to me and said\n\nI think my teacher used to go to school with you\n\nand she was right and if for just a second I take off these colored glasses\n\nI can see it might just be a waste of time\n\nand I don't know everyday that passes\n\nit gets easier to walk off and it seems alright\n\nand everyday another person I used to call my friend\n\njust dissapears from sight\n\nnow I see that I'm all alone\n\njust like I always was from the beginning\n\nand I think maybe that's the reason I'm not hanging around\n\nI see your face and wonder where you'll be five years from now\n\nand what it really means to you inside\n\nI can't explain the reasons why I can't hang out and bide my time\n\nit just keeps going on and on and on and on and on and I don't know"
