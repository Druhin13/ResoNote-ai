  "lyrics": "Time's running out on this merry go round\r\nA foolish pick is played - the running game\r\nAnd all the warning signs the plodding rush of time\r\nThat we all sullen muddle through\r\nAnd now we bow down and pray at the neon god we made\r\nThat we bought in haste for selfish gain\n\nAnd now we can't turn around till we take the whole thing down\n\nWith a dear price on our head\n\n\n\nThe animals know what's in store\n\nThe have plenty enough's all beg for more\n\nAnd we all forgot what we're fighting for\n\nA foolish prize we just can't ignore\n\n\n\nNow it's consumption by design on the production line\n\nWe tally up the sums for lucky ones\n\nIt's the have and have nots cause the system's all been bought\n\nFor the fortunate and few\n\nAnd we know when life gets hard we start charging up our cards\n\nSo many goods to use how can you refuse?\n\nSo ignore the missing bees, the climate rising by degrees\n\nAnd lay down your weary head\n\n\n\nThe animals know what's in store\n\nThe have plenty enough's all beg for more\n\nAnd we all forgot what we're fighting for\n\nA foolish prize we just can't ignore\n\n\n\nThe animals know what's in store\n\nThe have plenty enough's all beg for more\n\nAnd we don't know what we're fighting for\n\nA foolish prize\n\n\n\nThe animals know what's in store\n\nThe have plenty enough's all beg for more\n\nAnd we don't know what we're fighting for\n\nA foolish prize, just can't ignore"
