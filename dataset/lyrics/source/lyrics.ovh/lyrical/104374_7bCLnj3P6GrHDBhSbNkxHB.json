  "lyrics": "I can't get started from the part where I left off yesterday\r\nShould have spent my time a little wiser\r\nI sat alone\r\nGuilty as sin\r\nWaiting for words to come\r\nFrom out of my head\n\nStill making sense to anyone\n\n\n\nI can't wait to understand the reason\n\nI've yet to translate any meaning\n\nBesides, it's not worth it to try\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\n\n\nLocked myself up in a room without a window\n\nJust to see\n\nIf it was any easier to breathe\n\n(I was wrong)\n\nNever underestimate the daylight\n\nThere, it's so much easier to breathe\n\n\n\nI can't wait to understand the reason\n\nI've yet to translate any meaning\n\nBesides, it's not worth it to try\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\n\n\nThere's no meaning\n\nBesides, it's not worth it to try\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\nGet out\n\n\n\nGet out\n\nYeah"
