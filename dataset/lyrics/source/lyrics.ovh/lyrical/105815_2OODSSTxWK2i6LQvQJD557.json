  "lyrics": "Where you going? I don't mind\r\nI killed my world and I killed my time\r\nSo, where do I go? What do I see?\r\nI see many people coming after me\r\nSo, where you going to? I don’t mind\r\nIf I live too long, I'm afraid I'll die\n\nSo I will follow you wherever you go\n\nBut if your offered hand is still open to me\n\nStrangers on this road we are on\n\nWe are not two, we are one\n\n\n\nSo ya been where I just been\n\nFrom the land that brings losers home\n\nSo we will share this road we walk\n\nMind our mouths and beware our talk\n\nTill peace we find, tell you what I’ll do\n\nAll the things I own, I will share with you\n\nAnd if I feel tomorrow like I feel today\n\nWe'll take up what we want and give the rest away\n\nStrangers on this road we are on\n\nWe are not two, we are one\n\n\n\nHoly man and holy priest\n\nIt's a love alive, makes me weak in my knees\n\nAnd when we get there, make your plate\n\nSoon I feel you're gonna carry us away\n\nIn a promise lie you made us believe\n\nFor many men there is so much greed\n\nAnd my mind is proud but it aches with rage\n\nAnd if I live too long I'm afraid I'll die\n\nStrangers on this road we are on\n\nWe are not two, we are one\n\nStrangers on this road we are on\n\nWe are not two, we are one"
