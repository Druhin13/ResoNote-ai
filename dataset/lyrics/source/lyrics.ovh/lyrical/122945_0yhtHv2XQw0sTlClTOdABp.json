  "lyrics": "Nothing surprises me much\r\nAnd my hobbies include\r\nLaughing in the dark\r\nDo you want to go to the farm?\r\nDo you want to go to the park?\r\nI'll get you ice cream if you give me your card\n\n\n\nNothing impresses me much\n\nI've got a great attitude\n\nAnd a map to the stars\n\nI've got your number from that sign in the lawn\n\nI also want to vanquish evil but my mojo is gone\n\n\n\nCome on, I bet you know most of my friends\n\nThey're some real exclusive dudes from just around the bend\n\nThey're playing demos\n\nOh, they're wearing Dries\n\nI can escort you down the runway, I just joined the police...\n\nJust right now! So you wanna be a grifter like me?\n\nAre you hearing impaired with your own URL?\n\nI'm the second coming\n\nOh, I'm the last to know\n\nI didn't get invited but I know where to go"
