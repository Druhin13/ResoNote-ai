Hate the chill\r\nPressure down my spine, ah yeah\r\nIt’s all good, It’s not real, it’s 4-9\n\nIt's all nothing, no, no\n\n\n\nAnd maybe you'll find a way\n\nTo keep me a floating when I can't\n\nBut you know I won't\n\n'Cause you know I'll...\n\n\n\nFall too deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nToo deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nHouse burnt down, burnt down to the fucking ground\n\nI don't even care now if I make it out\n\nCan't get out my head, it's the atmosphere\n\nColours change, blue grass like the Lumineers\n\nI'm too deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nToo deep, too deep to get outta here\n\n\n\nAnd how do we make it out alive?\n\n\n\nI know something, I know something, I know we been here before\n\nCursed you out and then you haunt my shit and leave me furthermore\n\nIn the dark with this pressure is it over yet my dear\n\nCall on God, maybe tarots and cards deliver me from fear\n\n\n\nI know something, she said something\n\nOrange, yellow, white and red\n\nI keep waiting, smoking, praying\n\nThat I won't fall outta heaven no more\n\nNo more\n\n\n\nAnd maybe you’ll find a way\n\nTo keep me a floating when I can't, yeah\n\n'Cause you know I won't, 'cause you know I'll...\n\n\n\nFall too deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nToo deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nHouse burnt down, burnt down to the fucking ground\n\nI don't even care now if I make it out\n\nCan't get out my head, It's the atmosphere\n\nColours change, blue grass like the Lumineers\n\nI'm too deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nToo deep, too deep to get outta here\n\n\n\nHow do we make it out alive?\n\nAnd how do we make it?\n\n\n\nAre we committed? No\n\nAre you really here to ride or die?\n\nAin’t no way we coming out alive\n\nIs this what you want?\n\nNow for the moment, woah\n\nWhy are we reckless when we care so much?\n\nWe never plan to get our hearts involved\n\nI just hope that we ready if we fall\n\n\n\nFall too deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nToo deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nHouse burnt down, burnt down to the fucking ground\n\nI don't even care now if I make it out\n\nCan't get out my head, It's the atmosphere\n\nColours change, blue grass like the Lumineers\n\nI'm too deep, too deep to get outta here\n\nToo deep, too deep to get outta here\n\n\n\nHow will we make it out alive?"
