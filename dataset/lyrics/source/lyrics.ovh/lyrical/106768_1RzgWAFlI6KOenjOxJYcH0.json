  "lyrics": "I feel like a cat pulling strings\r\nThink I unraveled my mind\r\nI dropped a mouse into the sink just to watch it climb out\r\nThen took it to the woods and said you're free\r\nYou'll be living like this for awhile now\r\nYou're free\n\nFor awhile now at least\n\n\n\nYou say Cupid, I say Comet\n\nYou say Wallace, I say Gromit\n\nYou brought it back when I said\n\nYou promised to just call the whole thing off, please\n\nYou stay needy, I stay friendless\n\nYou stay pristine, I stay pretentious\n\nWe'd get married but it's too expensive\n\nLet's call the whole thing off, please\n\nOH. MY. GOD\n\nThis ain't a happening to me\n\nAnd it's ALL. YOUR. FAULT\n\nSaid by popular decree\n\nPossum Queen by law, she's been building up estates in East L.A\n\n\n\nIs this your first time? That's sweet\n\nSay \"hello\" to looking-forward for me\n\nIf I could set your mind at ease\n\nThis will last forever\n\nAnd when it doesn't, love it for what it is\n\nDon't miss it the way I do\n\nThe way I used to\n\nIf you love it, love it for what it's been\n\nDon't miss it\n\nDon't wish it back\n\nDon't wish it'd last 'cause if it doesn't\n\nLove it for what it is\n\nDon't miss it the way I do\n\nDon't miss it\n\nDon't miss it the way I miss you"
