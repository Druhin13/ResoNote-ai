Ah, yeah\n\nI wanna just put my arms around you\n\nLike the circles going around the sun\n\nLet me hold you, daddy, at least until the morning comes\n\n\n\nCan't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)\n\nCan't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)\n\nCan't be now (oh no)\n\nCan't be this loneliness, baby, surrounding me\n\n\n\nAnd I know it just can't be (No, it just can't be)\n\nThere's got to be some kind of answer (No, it just can't be)\n\nAnd everywhere I look, there's none around (No, it just can't be)\n\nOh, I realize, oh, I realize (No, it just can't be)\n\nI know it just can't be\n\n\n\nOh, I need a woman to love me\n\nOh, maybe you could help me, please\n\nOh, I need a woman to love, 'cause I believe that\n\nSomeday and somehow, it's bound to come along\n\n'Cause all my dreams and all my plans just cannot turn out wrong\n\n\n\nCan't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)\n\nCan't be now (oh no), can't be now (oh no)\n\nCan't be now (oh no)\n\nCan't be this loneliness, baby, surrounding me\n\n\n\nAnd I know it just can't be (No, it just can't be)\n\nThere's got to be some kind of answer (No, it just can't be)\n\nAnd everywhere I look, there's none around (No, it just can't be)\n\nWhoa, it just can't be (No, it just can't be)\n\n(No, it just can't be, no, it just can't be, no, it just can't be)"
