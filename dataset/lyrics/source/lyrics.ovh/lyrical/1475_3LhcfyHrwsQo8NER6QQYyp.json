  "lyrics": "She woke up one day with the rising of the sun\r\nSurrounded by fields of grain\r\nHopped on a plane never to return\r\nDestination hide the pain\r\nLanded in the middle of a big blue sea\r\nAnd before she had time to unpack\n\nShe listened to the sound of the waves on the shore\n\nAnd knew that she was never going back\n\n\n\nStay the course you can't turn back\n\nYou might get scared you might get lonely\n\nThinking about ways you could lose the path\n\nIt's all harmful distractions\n\nStay the course in a changing sea\n\nTides turning waves are churning\n\nThinking about trying to take another from me\n\n\n\nNever a cool kid\n\nHad no friends in school kid\n\nNever raised his hand in class\n\nAt night he stared at the stars on the ceiling wondering if his loneliness would last\n\nAnother chord he strummed another note he hummed\n\nAnother original melody\n\nBut as soon as he stepped on the stage and saw them smiling back he knew what he was meant to be"
