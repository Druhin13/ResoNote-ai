  "lyrics": "You were waiting for an answer\r\nIt was the hardest thing to hear\r\nSo strung out eclipsed by shivers\r\nMolleycoddled and sincere\r\nIt's a lonely life, a long and lonely life\n\nStay with me and\n\nBe a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight\n\n\n\nBut don't you be so cold\n\n\n\nYou were waiting for elation\n\nLike it would fall out of the sky\n\nMaybe time's the greatest healer\n\nBut baby everything will die\n\n\n\nIt's a lonely life, a long and lonely life\n\nStay with me and\n\nBe a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight, oh\n\n\n\nBut don't you be so cold\n\nDon't you be so cold\n\nDon't you be so cold\n\nDon't you be so cold\n\n\n\nIt's a lonely life, a long and lonely life\n\nStay with me and\n\nBe a ghost tonight, be a ghost tonight\n\n\n\nBut don't you be so cold\n\nAnd don't you be so cold\n\nAnd don't you be so cold\n\nAnd don't you be so cold\n\n\n\nAnd don't you be so cold\n\nAnd don't you be so cold\n\nAnd don't you be so cold"
