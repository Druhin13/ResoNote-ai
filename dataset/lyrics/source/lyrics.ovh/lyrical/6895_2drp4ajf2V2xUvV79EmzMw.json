Have put you out of my head\n\nWhy do we always pretend that we can only be friendly\n\nI'd forgotten to mention it\n\n\n\nSomeone call it now\n\nAnd pull me away\n\nI'm just waking up and all I wanna say is\n\nWe are, we are, we are, we are, yeah\n\nYeah we're absolutely failing\n\nWake me up\n\nWe have got so much, so much to learn\n\nWhat am i missing? What is it you've heard?\n\n'Cause we are, we are, we are, we are, yeah\n\nYeah we are absolutely failing\n\n\n\nWe are, we are, we are, we are, yeah\n\nWe are, we are, we are, we are, yeah\n\nWe are, we are, we are, we are, yeah\n\nYeah we are absolutely failing\n\nWake me up"
