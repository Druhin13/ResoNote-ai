  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Wild Ceaseless Song par Alela Diane\r\nI hear the waves break shore\nLike they always have\nA wild ceaseless song\nI dreamt your face\nWhen you were still inside\nAnd how your yellow hair would catch the light\n\nAnd the days move slow\nBut the years do know\nThat time couldn't move any faster\nTime couldn't move any faster\n\nWhen you passed through me\nI passed through a door\nOf letting go of everything that came before\nAnd I know now\n\nWhat every mother knows\nOf what it is to watch your heart escape your chest\n\nAnd the days move slow\nBut the years do know\nThat time couldn't move any faster\nTime couldn't move any faster\n\nWhen the sun is set\nOn my final hour\nWill you find me in the water's wild ceaseless song\nAnd in your face\nI see my father's eyes\nAnd in your daughter's eyes you may see me\nStaring at the open sea\nStaring at the open sea\n\n\nBut the days move slow\nAnd the years do know\nThat time couldn't move any faster\nTime couldn't move any faster"
