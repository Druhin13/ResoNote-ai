  "lyrics": "One step forward and two steps back\r\nNothing good ever comes easy\r\nI gave it all and got a knife in my back\r\nShould have known the ones I trusted would leave me\r\nThey only see what they wanna see\n\n\n\nHeavy is the weight that I hold\n\nThe weight that I hold\n\nI carry it cause it's all that I know\n\nThis is all that I know\n\nThe pressure on me, the pressure to be\n\nTrue to who I am\n\nHeavy is the weight, the weight that I hold\n\n\n\nOne life one chance, it's all I have\n\nWouldn't matter if the whole world hated me\n\nSo I move on, forget the the past\n\nAnd let them go back to thinking they made me\n\n\n\nThey only see what they wanna see\n\n\n\nHeavy is the weight that I hold\n\nThe weight that I hold\n\nI carry it cause it's all that I know\n\nThis is all that I know\n\nThe pressure on me, the pressure to be\n\nTrue to who I am\n\nHeavy is the weight, the weight that I hold\n\n\n\nHeavy is a weight\n\nI don't wanna wait\n\nFor them all to be good when\n\nI want to be great\n\nYeah, I know about pressure. Yeah, I know about stressin'\n\nWorried if I'll lose everything invested\n\nAnd I know about workin' when I'm hardly rested\n\nLike am I in tune with what I'm destined for?\n\nBeen carrying this weight for so long\n\nDidn't even notice that my back was so strong\n\nI can probably put a boat on it with no problem\n\nThe show must go on\n\n\n\nHeavy is the weight that I hold\n\nThe weight that I hold\n\nI carry it cause it's all that I know\n\nThis is all that I know\n\nThe pressure on me, the pressure to be\n\nTrue to who I am\n\nHeavy is the weight, the weight that I hold\n\n\n\nHeavy is the weight that I hold\n\nThe weight that I hold\n\nI carry it cause it's all that I know\n\nThis is all that I know\n\nThe pressure on me, the pressure to be\n\nTrue to who I am\n\nHeavy is the weight\n\nHeavy is the weight, the weight that I hold"
