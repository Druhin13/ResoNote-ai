  "lyrics": "The lights go out and I can't be saved\r\nTides that I tried to swim against\r\nHave brought me down upon my knees\r\nOh I beg, I beg and plead, singing\r\nCome out of things unsaid\n\nShoot an apple off my head and a\n\nTrouble that can't be named\n\nA tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing\n\n\n\nYou are\n\nYou are\n\n\n\nConfusion never stops\n\nClosing walls and ticking clocks\n\nGonna come back and take you home\n\nI could not stop that you now know, singing\n\n\n\nCome out upon my seas\n\nCursed missed opportunities\n\nAm I a part of the cure?\n\nOr am I part of the disease? Singing\n\n\n\nYou are, you are, you are\n\nYou are, you are, you are\n\n\n\nAnd nothing else compares\n\nOh nothing else compares\n\nAnd nothing else compares\n\n\n\nHome, home where I wanted to go\n\nHome, home where I wanted to go\n\n\n\nHome, (you) home where I wanted to (are) go\n\nHome, (you) home where I wanted to (are) go\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to MusicLoars and iheartpenguins113 for correcting these lyrics)"
