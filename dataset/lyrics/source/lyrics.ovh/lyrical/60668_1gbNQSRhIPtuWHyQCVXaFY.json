  "lyrics": "Stormy weather ahead and I don't know what to do\r\n(Think about it baby)\r\nWorld gone crazy we're beaten 'til we're black and we're blue\r\n(Think about it baby)\r\nFear's in fashion, the writing on the wall is obscene\r\n(Think about it baby)\n\nEverybody's shouting but I don't really know what they mean\n\n\n\nAnd the voices I hear are the voices inside of my head\n\nIt's a sign of the times maybe time to try something instead\n\n\n\nJust a little love and the world keeps turning\n\nJust a little love keeps our hearts from burning\n\nJust a little love I believe we're yearning\n\nJust a little love keeps the storm at bay\n\nJust a little love not the hate that's calling\n\nJust a little love and the walls start falling down\n\nAnd I believe there are angels calling\n\nJust a little love\n\nJust a little love\n\n\n\nI'm not sure that you love me like you loved me before\n\n(Think about it baby)\n\nSay that I'm crazy and maybe I would walk out the door\n\n(Think about it baby)\n\nEvery time I consider it you always pull at my heart\n\n(Think about it baby)\n\nTell me it's not the end that this is only the start\n\n\n\nAnd the voices I hear are the voices inside my head\n\nIt's a sign of the times maybe time to try something instead\n\n\n\nJust a little love and the world keeps turning\n\nJust a little love keeps our hearts from burning\n\nJust a little love I believe we're yearning\n\nJust a little love keeps the storm at bay\n\nJust a little love not the hate that's calling\n\nJust a little love and the walls start falling down\n\nAnd I believe there are angels calling\n\nJust a little love\n\nJust a little love\n\n\n\nJust a little love\n\nJust a little love\n\nJust a little love\n\nJust a little love"
