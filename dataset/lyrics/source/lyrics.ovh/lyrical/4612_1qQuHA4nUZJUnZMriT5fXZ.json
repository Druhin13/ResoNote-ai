  "lyrics": "You hold me\r\nI don't know who you are\r\nYou say I know you like I know myself\r\nIt's all perception\r\nMaybe I could love you like nobody else?\n\nLet's see how far\n\nWe can take this without breaking hearts\n\n\n\nSee what we're made of\n\nSo what are we afraid of?\n\n\n\nWe pretend we're not falling\n\nBut you can't keep your hands off of me\n\nYou caught me without warning\n\nYou hold me, you hold me\n\nClose enough to see right through me\n\nAnd I can't take my eyes off of you\n\nYou caught me without warning\n\nYou hold me, you hold me\n\n\n\nYou hold me\n\n\n\nWanna be where you are\n\nI'm drowning in my thoughts, I'm losing sleep\n\nIt's just perception\n\nBut I wish that you were lying next to me\n\nAnd I wait for your call\n\nWanna run, but first we learn to crawl\n\n\n\nSee what we're made of\n\nSo what are we afraid of?\n\n\n\nWe pretend we're not falling\n\nBut you can't keep your hands off of me\n\nYou caught me without warning\n\nYou hold me, you hold me\n\nClose enough to see right through me\n\nI can't take my eyes off of you\n\nYou caught me without warning\n\nYou hold me, you hold me\n\n\n\nYou hold me\n\nYou hold me\n\n\n\nYou hold me\n\nYou hold me"
