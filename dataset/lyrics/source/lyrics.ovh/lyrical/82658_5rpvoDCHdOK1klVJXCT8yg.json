  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson An Everlasting Love par Andy Gibb\r\nI've been here all your life\n\nWatching your crying game\n\nYou were the heaven in my lonely world\n\nAnd he was your sun and your rain\n\nI was losing you before I ever held you tight\n\nBefore you ever held me in your arms\n\nAnd I won't make you blue\n\nAnd maybe an everlasting love will do\n\n\n\nAh, we got an everlasting love\n\nSo tall, so wide\n\nSo high above the rumble of thunder down below\n\nIt's your love I need\n\nIt's the only show\n\nAnd it's you want an everlasting dream\n\nCan take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday\n\n\nWe killed the pain\n\nWe blew away the memories of the tears we cried\n\nAnd an everlasting love will never die\n\n\n\nTake me out of the cold\n\nGive me what I've hungered for\n\nIf it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need\n\nThen it only makes me love you more\n\nI was yours before the stars were born and you were mine\n\nI could have saved you all the pain you knew\n\nAnd I won't make you cry\n\nAnd maybe an everlasting love can try\n\n\n\nAh, we got an everlasting love\n\nSo tall , so wide\n\nSo high above the rumble of thunder down below\n\n\nIt's your love I need, it's the only show\n\nAnd it's you want an everlasting dream\n\nCan take us anywhere are the tears are yesterday\n\nWe killed the pain\n\nWe blew away the memories of the tears we cried\n\nAnd an everlasting love will never die"
