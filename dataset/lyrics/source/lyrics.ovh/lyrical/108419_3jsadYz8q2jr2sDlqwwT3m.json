  "lyrics": "You wore that white sundress, smoked a clove cigarette\r\nDanced barefoot and your hair was a mess\r\nYou drove a Jeep Cherokee but no money for gas\r\nCoulda looked at you all day long, all day long\r\nYou tried to downplay your beauty but you couldn't fool me\r\nYou tried to play like you're tough but you grew up by the beach\n\nSaid you hated the world but somehow you liked me\n\nCoulda looked at you all night long, all night long\n\nCoulda looked at you all night long, all night long\n\n\n\nHow can I forget you in the morning?\n\nHow can I forget you?\n\nI was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt\n\nWishing that you could still be here\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\n\n\nRan ten blocks in the rain, girl\n\nTrain ain't running this late, girl\n\nYou the only one to do me like that\n\nWhy you biting on your lip like that? (Don't stop)\n\nFalling through that doorway, stopping this ain't no way\n\n(Okay, smoke break)\n\nI shut my eyes for a second you were gone, gone, gone\n\nNow I'm thinking 'bout you all night long, all night long\n\n\n\nHow can I forget you in the morning?\n\nHow can I forget you?\n\nI was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt\n\nWishing that you could still be here\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\n\n\nYou wore that white sundress, smoked a clove cigarette\n\nDanced barefoot and your hair was a mess\n\nLet you slip through my fingers but you're stuck in my head\n\nAnd I'll be thinking 'bout you for so long, for so long\n\n\n\nHow can I forget you in the morning?\n\nHow can I forget you?\n\nI was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt\n\nWishing that you could still be here\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\nI was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt\n\nWishing that you could still be here\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\nHow can I forget? I can't, I can't\n\nHow can I forget?"
