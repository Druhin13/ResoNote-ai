  "lyrics": "Woke up dead, head poundin' like a kick-drum\r\nRed-eyed [? ] smoke-filled black lung\r\nCigarette burnin' holes in a fold-out\r\nMust've had one hell of a time, no doubt\r\nAnd I'm hazin' out of line\n\nFound a buzz and a hundred-proof chug and I lost my mind\n\nAin't got a drop left in the tank\n\nNot a nickel left in the bank\n\nYeah, we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank\n\n\n\nI remember feedin' twenties in a honky-tonk jukebox\n\nStepped up and ate shit in a pot-hole parkin' lot\n\nI gave a damn good cussin' to a big doorman\n\nMight have dotted my eye, but I'd do it again\n\n\n\nAnd I'm hazin' out of line\n\nFound a buzz and a hundred-proof chug and I lost my mind\n\nAin't got a drop left in the tank\n\nNot a nickel left in the bank\n\nYeah, we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank\n\n\n\nAnd I'm hazin' out of line\n\nFound a buzz and a hundred-proof chug and I lost my mind\n\nAin't got a drop left in the tank\n\nNot a nickel left in the bank\n\nYeah, we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank\n\n\n\nYeah we sang [?]\n\nSmoked ourselves silly\n\nWhen we partied like The Possum and we drank like Hank"
