  "lyrics": "I wonder what would happen if I fell\r\nWould you pick me up and be my wishing well\r\nIf I shared my secrets would you promise not to tell\r\nI wonder what would happen if I fell\r\nI wonder what would happen if I smiled\n\nWould you be the mystery in my eyes\n\nI'll consent to marry you if you never lie\n\nAnd I wonder what would happen if I smiled\n\n\n\nLooking for a sign in the eyes of love\n\nWaiting for an answer from the stars above\n\nWould you be my story when there's nothing left to tell\n\nI wonder what would happen if I fell\n\n\n\nWould you be the rockinghorse I ride\n\nIf I showed no fear and held you like a child\n\nRunning through the darkness till there's morning in the sky\n\nWould you be the rockinghorse I ride\n\n\n\nThen I ride, ride, you can be my rockinghorse, so giddy-up\n\nI said ride ride, ride ride, I said ride ride"
