  "lyrics": "Said you wanna try something new\r\nTired of the same thing\r\nSaid you wanna find someone who\r\nGets your heart racing\r\nWe're headed for the sunset of our love and we can't turn back\r\nIf only I had let it go before I got caught up in the trap\n\n\n\nBroken promises\n\nGet between me and you\n\nAnd when your heart breaks\n\nKnow that I feel it too\n\n\n\nShe said she’d never leave you sad and that she’d never leave you blue\n\nBut the things that she’s been doin got ya thinkin that ur though\n\nFirst she says she wants to leave but then come runnin back to you\n\nBaby cryin all the time and make ya feelin like a fool\n\nTry to lock up your heart and stealing your soul\n\nWanna get in your mind and she not lettin go\n\nHow it used to be fine now is takin its toll\n\nTake you out like the trash Leave you all in Sorrow\n\nShe said you are one of a kind but you were three in a row\n\nEverybody’s droppin dimes they tryin all to let you know\n\nIf ur thinkin ur on track but gotta long way to go\n\nIf she rippin up ur heart she gon be reepin what she sow\n\n\n\nToo many promises ya can’t keep\n\nToo many lies that you can’t take back\n\nIt’s too late for apologies\n\nI thought we were on the right track"
