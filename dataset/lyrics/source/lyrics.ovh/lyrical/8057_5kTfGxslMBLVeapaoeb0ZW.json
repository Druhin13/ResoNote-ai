  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Soul No. 5 par Caroline Rose\r\nI got a bicycle, I'm cruising down the street\nI like to keep it loose, a freak in the sheets\nI got a credit card and I use it all the time\nI got the goochi goochi gooey oozy icky oozy style\nI do a hair flip, I strut my stuff\nYou whispering at me, I can't hear you, I say, \"What\"\nI don't have a job but I got a lot of time\nBaby, show me yours and then maybe I'll show you mine\n\nBang bang and away she goes\nSouped up man, I'm ready to blow\nI got soul, I got soul\nI got soul\n\n\nRolling their windows down and screaming out my name\nLike, \"you looking good, mama, how you doin'?\nYou and me, girl, we have a really good time\"\nBut I like to hit 'em and quit 'em that's just my style\nI wear kicks, bitch, fresh out the box\nI got that box go like pop pop pop!\nRolling out the carpet and then shining down the lights\nMy girls are looking good and we going out tonight\n\nBang bang and away she goes\nSouped up girl, I am ready to blow\nI got soul, I got soul\nI got soul, soul\n\nSoul, soul, soul\n\nI got soul, I got soul\nI got soul, soul\nSoul, soul, soul"
