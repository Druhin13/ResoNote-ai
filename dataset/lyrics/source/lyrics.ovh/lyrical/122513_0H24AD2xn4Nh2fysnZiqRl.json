  "lyrics": "(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\r\nIf my senses fail meet me on the other side of paradise\r\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\r\nFree from complications of our sense of time\r\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nFill my windless sail with broken echoes of a never ending life\n\nWhispered conversations twisted faces in the clouds\n\n\n\nIâ€™ve been hot winged and hoodwinked and dead on my feet\n\nThe sound and the fury remain over me\n\nAnd all of the footprints that fall in a line\n\nWere our common ancestors wandering hills in the night\n\n\n\nIf my senses fail meet me on the other side of Paradise\n\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nFree from complications of our sense of time\n\n(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)\n\nFill my windless sail with broken echoes of a never ending life\n\nWhispered conversations twisted faces in the clouds\n\n\n\nLet unanswered question marks fall where they will\n\nThe thoughts that imprison me walk with me still\n\nAnd seconds that fly by like days of my life\n\nWere hours spent wasted on chasing the words of the wise\n\n\n\nIf my senses fail meet me on the other side of paradise\n\nFree from complications of our sense of time\n\nFill my windless sail with broken echoes of a never ending life\n\nWhispered conversations twisted faces in the clouds\n\n\n\nIn the clouds\n\nMeet me on the other side, I, I\n\nMeet me on the other side, I, I\n\nMeet me on the other side, I, I\n\nMeet me on the other side"
