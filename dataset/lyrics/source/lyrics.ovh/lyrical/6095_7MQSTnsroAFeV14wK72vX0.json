  "lyrics": "Just stay there for a minute\r\nAnd just don't move any closer, move closer\r\nI just don't know if I can take it\r\nIt feels like over exposure, move closer\r\nBrick by brick and scar by scar\n\nIt's taking me years to put up these guards\n\nI don't wanna get hurt again\n\nIs it agony or ecstasy?\n\nI feel safer now your close to me\n\nAnd fall apart\n\n\n\nOnce again I've broken, I've crumbled\n\nI'm in pieces on the floor\n\nDon't you know that damage you've done is\n\nJust irreparable\n\nYou'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe and it's clear\n\nI just don't know what I'm doing\n\nYour love left me in ruins\n\nWon't you ruin me again?\n\n\n\nYou took my world as I know it\n\nBut I don't want any closure, move closer\n\nCause you've become my one thing\n\nThat I want to get over, move closer\n\n\n\nIs it disaster or destiny\n\nThat I feel so right with you next to me\n\nAnd fall apart?\n\n\n\nOnce again I've broken, I've crumbled\n\nI'm in pieces on the floor\n\nDon't you know that damage you've done is\n\nJust irreparable\n\nYou'll find me in the wreckage of a love so severe and it's clear\n\nI just don't know what I'm doing\n\nYour love left me in ruins\n\nWon't you ruin me again?\n\n\n\n[?] my entire heart\n\nYou hit me, blessed me, shattered in a hurricane\n\nYour love is the frame that holds me through it\n\nI'm perfectly ruined\n\n\n\nOnce again I'm broken, I've crumbled\n\nI'm in pieces on the floor\n\nDon't you know that damage you've done is\n\nJust irreparable\n\nYou find me in the wreckage of a love so severe and it's clear\n\nI just don't know what I'm doing (I just don't know what I'm doing)\n\nYour love left me in ruins\n\nWon't you ruin me again?"
