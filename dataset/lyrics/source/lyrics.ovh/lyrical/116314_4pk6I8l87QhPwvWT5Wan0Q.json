  "lyrics": "You see my baby sends your love around\r\nJust to use it on another like a trick now\r\nOnly comes like a thief in the night\r\nBut you know that it's not right\r\nNow I know that it was foolish of me\r\nTo give away such a pivotal part of me\n\nIt's only sad because it could've been easy\n\nYeah, it could've been easy\n\n\n\nI know I'm not the only one who listened to ya\n\nBillie Jean, baby please, he's a criminal\n\nMaybe if I was young, unpredictable\n\nHe's got her heart and I\n\n\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all\n\n\n\nI used to think that she could've been an angel\n\nBut she left all her demons on my front step\n\nNow it's creeping up on me like it never left\n\nLike it never left\n\n\n\nYou know I lost my mind\n\nAbout a thousand times\n\nBecause it could've been easy\n\nYou know it could've been easy\n\n\n\nI know I'm not the only one who listened to ya\n\nBillie Jean, baby please, he's a criminal\n\nMaybe if I was young, unpredictable\n\nHe's got her heart and I\n\n\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all\n\n\n\nYou know I lost my mind\n\nAbout a thousand times\n\nBecause it could've been easy\n\nYou know it could've been easy\n\n\n\nI know I'm not the only one who listened to ya\n\nBillie Jean, baby please, he's a criminal\n\nMaybe if I was young, unpredictable\n\nHe's got her heart and I\n\n\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I\n\nAnd I want it all back, and I (want it all)\n\nAnd I want it all (want it all)"
