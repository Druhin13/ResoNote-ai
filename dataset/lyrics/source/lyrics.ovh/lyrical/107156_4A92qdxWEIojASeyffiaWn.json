  "lyrics": "You brought them to my door\r\nStood there on the front porch\r\nThat was the beginning\r\nWe had those tires spinning\r\nDown on the green grass\r\nOutside of town\n\nWild and free, never slowing down\n\nI thought I needed you like air\n\n\n\nWe burned hot, burned out, like a flame\n\nBut in my head, you'll never fade\n\n\n\nYeah, we were classic\n\nMy dress, your leather jacket\n\nDidn't know how good we had it\n\nBut, boy, we had it\n\n14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries\n\nYeah, we didn't know it\n\nThought we could grow it\n\nBeautiful for a moment\n\nWe were roses\n\nWe were roses\n\n\n\nYou put one in my hair\n\nDanced in the middle of nowhere\n\nYou and me all summer\n\nBright and living color\n\n\n\nMy lips were red\n\nYour eyes were blue\n\nAnd I thought I saw forever in you\n\n\n\nYeah, we were classic\n\nMy dress, your leather jacket\n\nDidn't know how good we had it\n\nBut, boy, we had it\n\n14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries\n\nYeah, we didn't know it\n\nThought we could grow it\n\nBeautiful for a moment\n\nWe were roses\n\n\n\nThe seasons had to change\n\nAnd like flowers they bloom and withered away\n\n\n\nYeah, we were classic\n\nMy dress, your leather jacket\n\nDidn't know how good we had it\n\nIt was so good while it lasted\n\n\n\nYeah, we were classic\n\nMy dress, your leather jacket\n\nDidn't know how good we had it\n\nBut, boy, we had it\n\n14th of February, gotta feeling my heart still carries\n\nYeah, we didn't know it\n\nThought we could grow it\n\nBeautiful for a moment\n\nWe were roses"
