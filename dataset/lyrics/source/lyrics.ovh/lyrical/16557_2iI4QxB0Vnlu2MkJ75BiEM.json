  "lyrics": "We're the lifted boys and girls and we are on a roll\r\nListening to everything from grunge to rock n' roll\r\nOur feet don't touch the ground\r\nFly like a plastic bag that's\r\nLifted\n\nWe inhale the helium and leave the shit below\n\nWe don't get in traffic jams we're shining on this road\n\nWith sunshine on our faces\n\nWe keep it super basic\n\nLifted\n\n\n\nWe got lifted on a Monday\n\nThen we floated away and it was Sunday\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\nWe get high up on the low down\n\nEvery day spinning like a merry go round\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\n\n\nWake up every morning we got troubles at our door\n\nWe get lifted right away no we don't touch the floor\n\nWe want to see in colour\n\nWe want to feel each other\n\nLifted\n\n\n\nDrifting through the day no I don't make my mama proud She keep trying to talk to me but I am in the clouds\n\nNo I don't feel the pressure\n\nUp here the air is fresher\n\nLifted\n\n\n\nWe got lifted on a Monday\n\nThen we floated away and it was Sunday\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\nWe get high up on the low down\n\nEvery day spinning like a merry go round\n\nAll we want is to forget\n\nAll we want is to forget"
