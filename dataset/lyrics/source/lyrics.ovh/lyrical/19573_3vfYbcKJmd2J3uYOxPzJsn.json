  "lyrics": "Please don't let me die in Florida\r\nI don't care about my name\r\nIf you catch me dying in Daytona\r\nRoll my bed on to a train\r\nI was born in Indian summer\n\nIn the South End long ago\n\nAnd those dirty streets cried out for rain\n\nAnd this is what I know\n\nAnd the rains came and they only stopped\n\nJust in time for snow\n\nAnd the icy cold filled up my shoes\n\nAnd this is what I know\n\n\n\nPlease don't let me die in Florida\n\nI don't care about my name\n\nIf you catch me dying in Orlando\n\nRoll my bed on to a train\n\n\n\nWell I went to war to fight the Japs\n\nWhen the war was over\n\nI threw my cap\n\nJust as far as you could throw a thing\n\nI went at home and gave my girl a ring\n\nI put the highways and the black top down\n\nTurned the prairies into the towns\n\nAnd those hills gave way just like a wedding gown\n\nI put the highways and the black top down\n\n\n\nI don't need to see no mirror\n\nI ain't never gonna see my own face\n\nJust a reflection of somebody\n\nWho's gonna leave without a trace\n\nRoll me over them, hills so cold and proud\n\nLet the night come in and lay my shroud\n\nI ain't never been to Cal-i-forn-aye-ay\n\nMaybe that's where I should end my days\n\n\n\nPlease don't let me die in Florida\n\nI don't care about my name\n\nIf you catch me dying in Orlando\n\nRoll my bed on to a train"
