  "lyrics": "There's not a soul in here\r\nPull up to your house and dump like a trash man\r\nAll up in your grill, but I'm not a fan\r\nMerlyn, I do no handshake, just show me where the cash at\r\nThen show me where the hash at, fuck that, show me where the cash at\n\nI would rather be on acid, rather make investments\n\nCome out of that debt, we'll come out of those bed sheets\n\nI'm like the IRS, pull up to your address\n\nI was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Ke$ha\n\nJohnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer\n\nI used to be broke, I don't got amnesia\n\nI used to deal with both, now it's black victims\n\nShe know not to call collect if she go to prison\n\n\n\nMove to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat\n\nGive me the answer figure, where you niggas at?\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\nMove to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat\n\nGive me the answer figure, where you niggas at?\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\n\n\nAt night I bring them out\n\nI was sleeping upside-down\n\nKeep you up, I come around\n\nThey stay right up on my tip\n\nSend me a pic whenever you slip\n\nHoping this outflow my scales\n\nFull throttle whenever I blaze\n\nFifty mil, put it under my wheel\n\nHuman, I see through your eyes\n\nUntil my CCC wide open to my skin\n\nThey can see they run\n\nThey feel like they been kicking DDR\n\nBustin' out the bar, human out the tour\n\nThey grip three types of the gas\n\nMiss the days I can't get back\n\n\n\nMove to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat\n\nGive me the answer figure, where you niggas at?\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\nMove to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat\n\nGive me the answer figure, where you niggas at?\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that\n\nWhere the cash at? Used to ask that"
