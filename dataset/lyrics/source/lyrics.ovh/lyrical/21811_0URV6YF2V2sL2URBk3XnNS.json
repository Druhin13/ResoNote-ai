  "lyrics": "I don't mean to stare so hard at you\r\nSuddenly your face makes dreams come true\r\nAnd, I see you there across the room\r\nAnd, I'm wondering what we could do\r\nYou start, watching me, I'm watching you\r\nAnd thinking what we is\n\nEverything we've taught not to do\n\nWas everything we did\n\n\n\nFar far away, in a distant land\n\nI found a young prince, who became my man\n\nHe looked me in my eye and he held my hand (runnin' runnin')\n\nAnd we found our lotus and received our plant\n\n\n\nBeam me up Scottie, it's time to fly\n\nLove is what I feel, and he holds me tight\n\nWe're Yung, learning to love, we don't give a uhhhh [x 2]\n\nRunnin runnin' [x4]\n\n\n\nThey say I shouldn't want you\n\nBut I can't help but want to, do\n\nEverything you want me to\n\nIf I could clear my head like how I want to\n\nThen everything would come to, fruition\n\nIf I'd only choose (if I'd only choose)\n\nTo follow or ?? Stop runnin' runnin'\n\nRunnin' against I ,shouldn't be messing with my mind\n\nTryin to manifest what's mine\n\n\n\nThis life imma be patient\n\nHoney I, I been waitin for you\n\nIt's been a trip, vacation\n\nHad to hijack mamas spaceship\n\nWe're Yung, learning to love, we don't give a uhhhh [x 2]\n\nRunnin runnin' [x8]\n\n\n\n?? fire, ascending higher\n\nCells will transmit and then we begin to\n\n??? Nation while levitatin\n\nChakras are glowin, while we are floatin'\n\nIn mother ocean\n\nI'm feelin emotions"
