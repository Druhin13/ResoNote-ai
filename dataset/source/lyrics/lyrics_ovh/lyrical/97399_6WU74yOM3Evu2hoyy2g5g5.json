  "lyrics": "I was wrong to say I loved her\r\nI was wrong to think I'm right\r\nBut when I told her it was over\r\nMy darling I had lied\r\nI've been running from my demons\r\nAfraid to look behind\n\nI've been running from myself\n\nAfraid of what I'd find\n\n\n\nBut how am I supposed to love you\n\nWhen I don't love who I am\n\nAnd how can I give you all of me\n\nWhen I'm only half a man\n\n'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning\n\nSo let go of my hand\n\nAnd how can I give you all of me\n\nWhen I'm only half a man\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm stuck in this hotel room\n\nBy cold neon light\n\nI've been waiting for an answer\n\nBut it won't come tonight\n\nAnd every bottle I had stolen\n\nIt laid shattered on the floor\n\nWhat's broken can't be whole, anymore\n\n\n\nBut how am I supposed to love you\n\nWhen I don't love who I am\n\nAnd how can I give you all of me\n\nWhen I'm only half a man\n\n'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning\n\nSo let go of my hand\n\nAnd how can I give you all of me\n\nWhen I'm only half a man\n\n\n\nNo one can ever hurt me\n\nLike I hurt myself\n\n'Cause I'm made out of stone\n\nAnd I'm beyond help\n\nDon't give your heart to me\n\n\n\n'Cause how am I supposed to love you\n\nWhen I don't love who I am\n\nAnd how can I give you all of me\n\nWhen I'm only half a man\n\n'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning\n\nSo let go of my hand\n\nAnd how can I give you all of me\n\nWhen I'm only half a man\n\n\n\nOnly half a man"
