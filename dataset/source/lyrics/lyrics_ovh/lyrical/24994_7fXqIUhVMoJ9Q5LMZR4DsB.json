  "lyrics": "You can't right click on a face\r\nYou can't be the winner of the human race\r\nYou can't do everything in this place\r\nBut don't die curious\r\nYou can't be the healer of every soul\r\nYou can't be the Queen all on your own\n\nYou can't beat the nighttime with a glow\n\nBut don't die curious\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't count every single grain of sand\n\nYou can't save a heart by holding a hand\n\nYou can't make everyone understand\n\nBut don't die curious\n\n\n\nHello words that I just did not say\n\nI found a way to hesitate, to deviate\n\nOh, we just died curious\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can't be a runner with a broken toe\n\nYou can't paint a painting like Van Gogh\n\nYou can't pronounce everything right, you know?\n\nBut don't die curious\n\nYou can't move a mountain in a beat\n\nYou can't find the truth of everyone you meet\n\nYou can't kiss a stranger in the street\n\nBut don't die curious\n\n\n\nHello words that I just did not say\n\nI found a way to hesitate, to deviate\n\nOh, we just died curious\n\n\n\nYou can't change a mind without a fight\n\nWaiting for the hope of a morning light\n\nYou can't find love on your own tonight\n\n\n\nHello life that I just did not do\n\nIgnored the clues, I ran from you\n\nI found the blues\n\nOh, we just died\n\nHello words that I just did not say\n\nI found a way to hesitate, to deviate\n\nOh, we just died curious"
