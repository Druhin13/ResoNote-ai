  "lyrics": "You say my vision's not a vision at all\r\nThere's no degree in rock n roll\r\nSay it's a waste of time\r\nSay I'll never get a real shot\r\nI'll be bangin' my head 'til my brain rots\r\nI'll be bangin' my head 'til my brain rots\n\n\n\nI feel the energy from my head to my feet\n\nThere's an anger or passion empowering me\n\nI know talk's not cheap, I'm done grinding my teeth\n\nTime to slap you in the face with reality\n\n\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\n\n\nWe've been deceived the same by the powers that\n\nWe're sold future perfection but it will not come cheap\n\nMaybe I love it, but I'd rather believe\n\nI'm just breaking the surface and you will never stop me\n\n\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\n\n\nYou say my vision's not a vision at all\n\nThere's no degree in rock and roll\n\nSay it's a waste of time\n\nSay I'll never get a real shot\n\nI'll be bangin' my head 'til my brain rots\n\nI'll be bangin' my head 'til my brain rots\n\n\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener\n\nNo structure\n\nNo prisoners\n\nI'm not deaf, I'm just a real bad listener"
