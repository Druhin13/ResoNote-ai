  "lyrics": "Everybody knows how much he meant to you, baby \nBut you still insist that your heart's alright \nI can see that he's about to get the best of you, maybe \nYou're too ashamed to cry and it's gettin' hard to hide \nIt's gonna get bad, before it gets better \n\nYou can cry and cry, but he still won't call \n\nIt's gonna get sad, maybe even sadder \n\nBut you're not over the heartache \n\nYou're still under the fall \n\n\n\nWhen it comes to love, you've always had your way \n\nAnd you never had your heart broke, or so you say \n\nNo you can't fool me, I know he's on your mind \n\nThere's things in love that just happen sometime \n\n\n\nIt's gonna get bad, before it gets better \n\nYou can cry and cry, but he still won't call \n\nIt's gonna get sad, maybe even sadder \n\nBut you're not over the heartache \n\nYou're still under the fall \n\n\n\nIt's gonna get bad, before it gets better \n\nYou can cry and cry, but he still won't call \n\nIt's gonna get sad, maybe even sadder \n\nBut you're not over the heartache \n\nYou're still under the fall"
