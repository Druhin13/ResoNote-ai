  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Happy & Sad par Kacey Musgraves\r\nIt's not you, it's the glow of the party\nThe way that you've got me lit up inside\nIt's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'\nIt's never felt so right\n\nAnd I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous\nWhen I'm having the time of my life\n\nIs there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?\nHappy and sad at the same time\nYou got me smiling with tears in my eyes\nI never felt so high\nNo, I've never been this far off of the ground\n\nAnd they say everything that goes up must come down\nBut I don't wanna come down\n\nSo is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?\n'Cause I don't wanna wake up\nWhen they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me\n'Cause it feels so right\n\nAnd I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous\nWhen I'm having the time of my life\n\nIs there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?\nHappy and sad at the same time\n\nYou got me smilin' with tears in my eyes\nI never felt so high\nNo, I've never been this far off of the ground\nAnd they say everything that goes up must come down\nBut I don't wanna come down\n\nI don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'\nI'm comfortable when the sky is gray\nBut when everything is perfect, I start hidin'\n'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way\n\n'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time\nYou got me smilin' with tears in my eyes\nI never felt so high\nNo, never been this far off of the ground\nAnd they say everything that goes up, goes up must come down\n\nAnd I don't wanna come down\nNo, I don't wanna come down"
