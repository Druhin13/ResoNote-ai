  "lyrics": "It was a Coldplay concert on a Thursday night\r\nYou had a spare ticket\r\n'Cause your girlfriend cheated and broke your heart\r\nAnd you took it hard\r\nI knew that it was far too soon to call it a date\r\nBut you took my hand and I swear something changed\n\n‘Cause I felt the spark\n\nBut she still had your heart\n\n\n\nAnd I wish that I could fix you\n\n‘Cause she’s playing with your head\n\nAnd I wish that I could kiss you\n\nBut we’re less than lovers and more than friends\n\nAnd it’s just killing me\n\n\n\nIt was a Coldplay concert on a Thursday night\n\n40,000 people with their hands in the sky\n\nStanding by your side, I should have been singing\n\nBut wishing you were mine was all that I was thinking\n\nBut I knew you wanted her when you looked in my eyes\n\nAnd you almost kissed me underneath the lights\n\nAnd it should be me, stuck on your mind, taking your time\n\nIt should be me, stealing your heart, driving you wild (wild)\n\n\n\nEvery night we talk on the phone ‘til it’s far too late\n\nBut she always comes up in the conversation\n\nI shouldn’t care, but you’re only halfway here\n\nYou say you’re over her, but you’re lying to yourself\n\n‘Cause you’re looking in my eyes but you’re somewhere else\n\nIf you could just move on\n\nI could be the one you want\n\n\n\nAnd I wish that I could fix you\n\n‘Cause she’s playing with your head\n\nAnd I wish that I could kiss you\n\nBut we’re less than lovers and more than friends\n\nAnd it’s just killing me\n\n\n\nIt was a Coldplay concert on a Thursday night\n\n40,000 people with their hands in the sky\n\nStanding by your side, I should have been singing\n\nBut wishing you were mine was all that I was thinking\n\nBut I knew you wanted her when you looked in my eyes\n\nAnd you almost kissed me underneath the lights\n\nAnd it should be me, stuck on your mind, taking your time\n\nIt should be me, stealing your heart, driving you wild\n\n\n\n‘Cause a girl like that don’t deserve your love\n\nAnd I know you know that it should be us\n\nSo if you’re giving your love to somebody\n\nWell it should be me, stuck on your mind, taking your time\n\nIt should be me, stealing your heart, driving you wild\n\n\n\nIt was a Coldplay concert on a Thursday night\n\n40,000 people with their hands in the sky\n\nStanding by your side, I should have been singing\n\nBut wishing you were mine was all that I was thinking\n\nBut I knew you wanted her when you looked in my eyes\n\nAnd you almost kissed me underneath the lights\n\nAnd it should be me, stuck on your mind, taking your time\n\nIt should be me, stealing your heart, driving you wild\n\nWild, wild"
