  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Swing par Josiah and the Bonnevilles\r\nI step into my corner\nI gather up my might\nShe's standing over my shoulder\nIt's gonna be one hell of a fight\nShe moves in my direction\nShe's such a lovely thing\nI put aside my affection\nShe says so me\n\nBaby, take a swing\nTake a swing\n\nShe falls back into the ocean\nFull of blood and rage\nShe rises up as a cloud forms\nBringing her friend, the rain\n\nNow she's so high up above me\nShe's coming down in waves\nBut I never worry\nBaby, I don't feel your pain\n\nTake a swing\nTake a swing\n\nYou think you got the best of me\nYou think you left me hurt\nBut I've been had much better\nAnd I've been left much worse\nI still shot in the darkness\nI still walk through the fire\nAnd I come out on the other side\nAnd the angels take me higher\n\nTake a swing\n\nTake a swing\n\nI step into my corner\nI gather up my might\nShe's standing over my shoulder\nI'm getting ready for one hell of a fight\nShe moves in my direction\nShe's such a lovely thing\nBut I, there's no more affection\nCome onto me\n\nBaby, take a swing\nTake a swing\nBaby, take a swing"
