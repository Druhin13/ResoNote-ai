Niggas ain't sold one pill\nShit get deep, I can't even get no sleep, brodie just caught him a kill\nFucked up Teezy got life, hope he get an appeal, thinking 'bout it give me the chills\nMy mama, she birthed a star, roof got shooting stars, the coupe got push to start\nI hop out, it park itself, gotta go hard, Goyard on the belt\n\nJust made me a hundred, it really wasn't nothin', don't hear shit but money, don't talk me to death\nI'll get you what you need, the lean, the blocks, the P's, you could pull up all night lean\nI'm rockin' three links, all VVs, I'm tryin' real hard not to cause a scene\nDash say 240, I'm doin' 180\nJust broke the bank, four pockets like Baby\nSittin' back thinkin' how far I could take it\nTold 'em I want it, they thought I was fakin'\nTell me, where would I be if I quit? Where would I be if I make it?\nMy mom used to tell me I ain't got no friends 'cause these niggas playin' it crazy\nGot older, I see what she mean, I gotta stay low, gotta make it home to my seed\nMy hoodie, my flannel, my skully Celine\n\nAnd when I looked down, I ain't get back a thing\nNow I look back, all I see is the wing\nThe G.O.A.T. G.T., new Bent' GT\nMatte black, peanut butter seats\nBack back, we in here too deep\nI only rock Chrome if it's Matty\nI don't do the chrome, get the black one\nFive racks on a Virgil jacket\nYou know what's up with me, I'm from the D, so it's white buffs on the package\n\n\n[Segue]\nYou know how we do it around this bitch, man, for real\nI'ma tell you like this\nCome on\nAyy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n\n\nMake a mess (Make a mess)\nMake a mess (Make a mess)\nFifty thousand ones\nFuck up the whole club\nThey thought we was done\nBring the rest (Brrt)\nMake a mess (Come on)\nMake a mess (Come on, yeah)\nFifty thousand ones\nFuck up the whole club\nMake a mess (Make a mess)\nMake a mess (Make a mess)\nThey thought we was done (Come on)\nFuck up the whole club\nMake a mess\n\n\n\nPull up to the club at 1:30, fuck up a whole thirty\nBlow it 'cause we bird serving (For real)\nPull up, we got curb service\nI don't see these niggas no more, I do it third person\nI'm up while the birds chirping\nChill while them bitches circle\nBaby, I got long paper\nCheck like a ball player (Let's go)\nFall in the club, throw it all, change the wallpaper\nPlease don't get us started, turn these floors to green carpet (Come on)\nPull up, leave them bitches running, we don't need no valet parking (Ayy)\nAyy, now what's next?\n\nWe got them Lambos, put up them 'Vettes (Vroom, vroom)\nCount up a mill' ticket, I ain't break a sweat (Break a sweat)\nWe goin' up on 'em, board a jet (Board a jet)\nAyy (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)\n\nMake a mess\nMake a mess\nFifty thousand ones (Brrt)\nFuck up the whole club (Brrt)\nThey thought we was done\nBring the rest"
