Can this get more indigenous than my dreams?\n\nYou'd be kidding if you're sticking to listening to the schemes\n\nI'm the real deal\n\nAnd youre stuck up\n\nI can tell still\n\nThat you done fucked up\n\nIs this real life?\n\nAm I the one up?\n\nCan I provide for my loved ones?\n\nI don't have any flaws, I won't call out myself\n\nWhen my back's to the wall, I won't call out for help\n\nI don't think that you get why I do it\n\nI do not your permission, I'm all 'bout myself\n\nI can show you my steps and the path that I take\n\nI can show you how I kept the food on my plate\n\nI can show you how I walked along through the road\n\n'Cause I'm thankful for every next day that I wake\n\n\n\nI never sleep, I live a dream, but I want more\n\nAnd talk is cheap, but nothing's free, oh I want more\n\nCan’t you see that I want more?\n\nWhatchu think that I been grinding for?\n\nAnd I'ma get it by myself\n\n'Cause I never needed nobody help\n\n\n\nI remember looking through couches to pinch pennies\n\nNow I never stress it, you know that I make plenty\n\nFuck five racks, every month I need twenty\n\nShit, I’m always gonna want more, fuck all of the pettiness\n\nFrom everybody else\n\nIf I got it, I did it with no help\n\nI put my ego right up on the shelf\n\nI just said, \"Fuck, it's time to excel\"\n\nI'm 'bout make millions from being myself\n\nI got no complaints, but a lavish life is my taste\n\nI ain't gonna get there living life safe\n\nI'm just doing what I gotta, I don't gotta be a saint, that's facts\n\nName a great man that never took risks\n\nName a brave man that never did shit\n\nHomie, they can’t, make you get a grip that\n\nCaveman, mindset ain't lit\n\nI been trine live a life outta the box\n\nSo now the whole world's trine block\n\nMe from the shit that I'm doing, the life I'm pursuing, and there ain't much time on the clock\n\nSo I don't stop, I'll never sleep\n\nWorking so hard, I'm forgetting to eat\n\nThe mountain I'm climbing can get pretty steep\n\nBut I'll never stop 'til I get to the peak\n\nOakes\n\n\n\nI never sleep, I live a dream, but I want more\n\nAnd talk is cheap, but nothing's free, oh I want more\n\nCan’t you see that I want more?\n\nWhatchu think that I been grinding for?\n\nAnd I'ma get it by myself\n\n'Cause I never needed nobody help"
