  "lyrics": "I wanna take you home\r\nA night out on the town\r\nSay that you’re pretty so you stand up stand up\r\nBefore I drag you down\r\nCrawling up your skin\n\nPotions pills and medicines\n\nTo drain you\n\nAnd bleed your magic out\n\n\n\n(woah)\n\nLonely little life\n\nAnd nobody believes you now\n\nYou’re bleeding magic out\n\n\n\n​Don’t want to scare you off\n\nDon’t want to know your name\n\nYou’ll never know a single thing about me\n\nUntil it’s far too late\n\n\n\nCrawling up your skin\n\nPotion, pleasing medicines\n\nTo circumvent your brain"
