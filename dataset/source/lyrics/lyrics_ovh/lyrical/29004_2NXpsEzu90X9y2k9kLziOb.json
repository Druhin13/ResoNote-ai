  "title": "The Great Unknown",
  "lyrics": "A song is a dream that keeps going on when it's over\r\nA man hears a song in the soft speaking voice of his lover\r\nA hero goes on when the others believe it's all over\r\nA sister is strong when she fights for the cause of her brother\r\nA crow with a broken wing stands at the side of the highway\n\nA traveller finds a place to sleep at the end of a long day\n\nI speak through a telephone\n\nYou can't decipher what I say\n\nWe'll meet in Decatur\n\nI'll tell you I love you in five days\n\n\n\nA human is something that rises and falls over time dear\n\nYour breathing slows down and you sleep in the fluorescent light dear\n\nWe're passing through town and there isn't a soul we can trust here\n\nWe don't use our real names. We struggle. We do what we must here\n\n\n\nDrive with me into the Great Unknown\n\nI think we are on our own. I think we're really on our own\n\n\n\nA song is a dream that keeps going on when it's over\n\nA man hears a song in the soft speaking voice of his lover\n\nA hero goes on when the others believe it's all over\n\nA sister is strong when she fights for the cause of her brother"
