  "lyrics": "Everywhere I went today\r\nfour walls kept following me around laughing quietly\r\nthreatening to break down and leave me curled up screaming\r\nI watch them cackle like baboons\r\nand snd smell the stench of their perfume\r\nthe've single-handedly stopped evolution\n\nit's all in my head and it's gonna stay that way\n\nI gag and I force down this spoiled version of the facts\n\nof life I cram my square head\n\nin to the round holes but it's pointless trying\n\nI wish that I could make my mind\n\naccept the lies that keep those blobs of human meat alive\n\nI know I can't and I wonder who was around\n\nwith a shovel when we paved these roads that don't go anywhere\n\nstanding around while the wires jumped and burned\n\nwith a where's my paycheck look on their faces\n\nkeep it around so you feel a little safer\n\nwhen you drag your fat ass to bed at night\n\nkeep it going around keep the rotten foundation of your cheap little lives\n\nfrom caving in it's all in my head it better stay that way"
