God only knows\n\n[Jack Gilinsky]\nIs it too late to find you, are you out there?\nKnow you're out there somewhere tonight\nIn that same dress, with that same look in your eyes\nIs it too late to tell you how I felt about you?\nOn that one night when we undressed\nAnd we jumped in, can I confess? (Shit)\n\n[ Jack Gilinsky]\nI might've been in love with you\n\nI might've been the one for you\nNow you're the one that got away\nI never even got your name, Miss\n\n[Jack Gilinsky]\nBarcelona\nTake me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)\nWhere did you go? God only knows\nOh, Miss Barcelona\nTake me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)\nWhere did you go? God only knows\nTake me back to Barcelona\n\n[Jack Johnson]\nGirl, I hope you feel the same\nSo much more between us than this ocean and these waves\nNo FC, no Messi; we kicked it for the day\n\nWe met in Barcelona, had to go our separate ways\nBaby, I know you still think about that night\nOr maybe I'm naive, just holding on to you and me\nOnly got like two or three hours with you before I had to\nHit the road onto the next, I guess we'll never know\n\n[ Jack Gilinsky]\nI might've been in love with you\nI might've been the one for you\nNow you're the one that got away\nI never even got your name, Miss\n\n[Jack Gilinsky]\nBarcelona\nTake me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)\nWhere did you go? God only knows\n\nOh, Miss Barcelona\nTake me back to Barcelona (Oh, oh)\nWhere did you go? God only knows\nTake me back to Barcelona\n\n[ Jack Gilinsky]\n(Oh, oh)\nWhere did you go? God only knows\nTake me back to Barcelona, oh\nWhere did you go? God only knows\nTake me back to Barcelona\nBarcelona"
