  "lyrics": "I'm at the door at a quarter to four\r\nPoppers blocking, baby, might take some more\r\nI'm fucking loose, you're gorgeous, I don't care\r\nCome closer, baby, slap me like that snare\r\n'Moon Shaped Pool' plays in the velvet cell\n\nGreat neon sign reads \"Welcome to Hell\"\n\nLeather slings fall like oxygen masks\n\nWe're going down, fuck my life in half\n\n\n\nSchool of magic, with brooms and wands\n\nPairs of people tugging like hungry dogs\n\nFor bone, baby, in the house of slithering\n\nFloor full of happy wizards scissoring\n\n\n\nI don't subscribe to your cultural norms\n\nMy church's doctrine has lost it's charm\n\nRise above the gloom of the jungle floor\n\nHit me like that snare, more, more, more\n\n\n\nI don't subscribe to your cultural norms\n\nMy church's doctrine has lost it's charm\n\nFamily matters. I couldn't agree more\n\nThis is my family f*sting me on the floor\n\n\n\nRegret my safe word, one to ten in Japanese\n\nAt the party, carpet burning my knees\n\nNa na na na na na na na na na na na\n\n(ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, jyuu)\n\nIchi, ni, san, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, jyuu\n\nIchi, ni, san, go, roku, nana, hachi, kyu, jyuu\n\n\n\nWe are dangerous teenagers\n\nWe are dangerous teenagers\n\n\n\n\n\nFuck you, I'll do what I want to do\n\nFuck you, I'll do what I want to do\n\nFuck you, I'll do what I want to do\n\nFuck you, I'll do what I want to do"
