  "lyrics": "Years and years of confine, the fences and the gates\r\nThis has been our whole life, resigning to our fate\r\nWhen one day came a fury, a wild and wicked wind\r\nThat blew the gates wide open to give us hope again\r\nLiberty\n\nThrough the desert riding free\n\nLike an unchained melody\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\n\n\nFrom Phoenix, Arizona to old New Mexico\n\nFeeling all the freedom to go where we wanna go\n\nWe could cross the ocean, travel 'cross the plains\n\nWe possess the power 'cause we control the reigns\n\n\n\nLiberty\n\nThrough the desert riding free\n\nLike an unchained melody\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\nLiberty\n\nWriting our own destiny\n\nWe'll go down in history\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\n\n\nLiberty\n\nThrough the desert riding free\n\nLike an unchained melody\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\nLiberty\n\nWriting our own destiny\n\nWe'll go down in history\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\nRiding towards the sun\n\nRiding towards the sun"
