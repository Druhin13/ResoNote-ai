  "lyrics": "I've spent a lot of effort on motherfuckers like you\r\nNow it's my turn\r\n1 2 3, fuck you!\r\nFuck you!\r\nYou can run away from anything that you have ever done\n\nYou're a victim of the system, you're a knife and I'm a gun\n\nYou want to be a martyr but you can not take the pain\n\nYou're a voice without an echo, you're a drop and I'm the rain\n\n\n\nYou want me to just turn the other cheek\n\nWant me to admit that I am weak\n\nWant me to submit? That ain't me, that ain't me\n\n\n\nYou're so self righteous\n\nAnd you're never going to change\n\nYou're sick and spineless\n\nYou're the fake and I'm the fame\n\n\n\nYou can't convince me life is fair\n\n'Cause you were never even there\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter, matter at all\n\nThat's why I never really cared\n\n'Cause I was never really scared\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter, matter, matter, no!\n\n\n\nI want to run away from everything I've ever said\n\nIt's hard to really care when everything I love is dead\n\nCan't take away a single thing that I have ever done\n\nI'm learning from the burden and that's just half the fun\n\n\n\nYou want me to just turn the other cheek\n\nWant me to admit that I am weak\n\nWant to wear the crown? Learn to bleed, learn to bleed\n\n\n\nYou're so self righteous\n\nAnd you're never going to change\n\nYou're dead and lifeless\n\nYou're a pawn within the game\n\n\n\nYou can't convince me life is fair\n\n'Cause you were never even there\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter, matter at all\n\nThat's why I never really cared\n\n'Cause I was never really scared\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter, matter, matter, no!\n\n\n\nGo!\n\n\n\nYou can't convince me life is fair\n\n'Cause you were never even there\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter, matter at all\n\nThat's why I never really cared\n\n'Cause I was never really scared\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter, matter, matter"
