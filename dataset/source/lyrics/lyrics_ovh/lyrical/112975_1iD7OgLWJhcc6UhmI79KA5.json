  "lyrics": "Sinking ever further down, down\r\nHoping you can make it safe to higher ground\r\nDeadly, the path you take\r\nTrust me, I know you can make it\r\nAnother dark cloud is forming at sea\n\nAnother fierce hurricane, just keep your eyes open\n\n(Another dark cloud is forming at sea\n\nAnother fierce hurricane, just keep your eyes open)\n\n\n\nThrough the fog and the storm\n\nI'll burn brightly\n\nPoint your path to the shore\n\nLet the light guide you home\n\n\n\nThinking you must make it all alone\n\nIs no way to make it safely back to home\n\nHold on, keep me inside\n\nJust know that, I'll get you through the morning\n\n\n\nAnother dark cloud is forming at sea\n\nAnother fierce hurricane, just keep your eyes open\n\n\n\nThrough the fog and the storm\n\nI'll burn brightly\n\nPoint your path to the shore\n\nLet the light guide you home"
