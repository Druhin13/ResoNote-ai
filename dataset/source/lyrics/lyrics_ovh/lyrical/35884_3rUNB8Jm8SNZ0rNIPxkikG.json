  "lyrics": "We are moving slow\r\nDeep into the night, hereafter falls\r\nI am keeping close, close to nothing\r\nLet the mallet swing through the fire\r\nI see your face staring back at me\r\nYou know I turn to you for self abusing\n\n\n\nAll of our ears to the floorboards\n\nMy eyes are falling everywhere\n\nI know who is in the backyard\n\nBut who's that living in our home\n\n\n\nWe are moving slow\n\nI am a pawn in every step you take\n\nIllusion wraps me up, keeps me guessing\n\n\n\nYou put my back to the wall\n\nSomehow that wasn't enough\n\nI'm the result of what you never were\n\n\n\nAll of our ears to the floorboards\n\nMy eyes are falling everywhere\n\nI know who is in the backyard\n\nBut who's that living in our home\n\nAll of our ears to the floorboards\n\nThere's nothing left for anyone\n\nI know who is in the backyard\n\nBut who's that living in our home\n\n\n\nIf I'm in vain then you must be too\n\nAre we on our way back down?\n\nInto delusion we will go to stare at a glimpse of hope\n\nMake me more assured, clean my wounds\n\nMy flickering thoughts; all wrong\n\nInto delusion we will go to stare at a glimpse of hope\n\n\n\nYou put my back to the wall\n\nSomehow that wasn't enough\n\nI'm the result of what you never were\n\n\n\nAll of our ears to the floorboards\n\nMy eyes are falling everywhere\n\nI know who is in the backyard\n\nBut who's that living in our home\n\nAll of our ears to the floorboards\n\nWe peel them back forevermore\n\nI know who is in the backyard\n\nBut who's that living in our home"
