  "lyrics": "Sweet wonderful you,\r\nYou make me happy with the things you do,\r\nOh, can it be so,\r\nThis feeling follows me wherever I go.\r\nI never did believe in miracles,\r\nBut I've a feeling it's time to try.\n\nI never did believe in the ways of magic,\n\nBut I'm beginning to wonder why.\n\nDon't, don't break the spell,\n\nIt would be different and you know it will,\n\nYou, you make loving fun,\n\nAnd I don't have to tell you you're the only one.\n\nYou make loving fun.\n\nYou make loving fun."
