You side bet\nWe live threats, gotta flip, take it off\nFuck 'em all, gotta ball, we stuck in that mindset\nAnd the belly of the beast is some shit you can dissect\n\nFood for thought, this reality, shit you can digest\nThey feel some type of way, oh yeah, we see the curve\nRay Bans on in the summer and then we swerve\nEast Side shit, nothing is by the book though\nI ain't prejudge you, just keep your ear to the hook, though (East Side)\n\n[Dcmbr]\nRunning from the cops, bustin' potshots, aiming at my enemies\nEverybody gotta die but come across me, I'ma kill first 'fore you kill me, ayy\n'Cause all the guap, all the knots, all the scars that I got, it started off the block, ayy\nGrass ain't greener on this side and on the other side my gun still cocked\n\n'Cause it started off the block"
