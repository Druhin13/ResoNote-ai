  "lyrics": "Tired of being away, tryna stay awake\r\nWhen I think that you will always know\r\nThat's where you go\r\nIt's just where you and I go\r\nTry to write this song in another town\n\nIn the backseat of this train\n\nYou say that I'm insane\n\nMaybe I am and I don't know\n\n\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\n'Cause I'm gonna let it burn\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\nAll my days, good things don't come\n\nTo those who wait\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\n\n\nTired of being away, tryna stay awake\n\nWhen I think that you will always know\n\nThat's where we go\n\nIt's just where you and I go\n\n\n\nSo when you're worried that you're burning out\n\nAnd your friends don't know what you're talking 'bout\n\nYou say your candle's gonna burn out\n\n\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\n'Cause I'm gonna let it burn\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\nAll my days, good things don't come\n\nTo those who wait\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\n\n\nWhen my head was down my mama told me\n\nTo take some time to get out in the rain\n\nAnd as I blamed it all, no caution to the wind\n\nBlowing hard to keep this happening\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm gonna let it burn\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn\n\nAll my days, good things don't come\n\nTo those who wait\n\nYeah I'm gonna let it burn"
