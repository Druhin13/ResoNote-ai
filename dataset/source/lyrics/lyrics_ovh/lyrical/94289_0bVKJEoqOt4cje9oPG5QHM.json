  "lyrics": "Give me skies of black and blue, the way you make me feel.\r\nGive me skies of green and red, cold winds will make it real.\r\nStorms are brewing deep within of hurt and loss of pride.\r\nIt's good to see the world in pain when I take a walk outside.\r\n\n\nWhen it rains, I don't mind being lonely.\n\nI cry right along with the sky.\n\nWhen it rains, I don't pretend to be happy.\n\nI don't even have to try.\n\nwhen it rains, some people get down to sportin' a frown.\n\nSo I fit right in.\n\nYeah the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way I'd take the rain.\n\n\n\nI don't care about politics or the hypocrites on my T.V.\n\nI'm not mad at the girl who left because she couldn't be with me.\n\nSo make up the theories about the scandals and the lies.\n\nStart out depressed, everything comes as a pleasant surprise.\n\n\n\nWhen it rains, I don't mind being lonely.\n\nI cry right along with the sky.\n\nWhen it rains, I don't pretend to be happy.\n\nI don't even have to try.\n\nWhen it rains, some people get down to sportin' a frown.\n\nSo I fit right in.\n\nYeah the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way I'd take the rain.\n\n\n\nWhen it rains, I don't mind being lonely.\n\nI cry right along with the sky.\n\nWhen it rains, I don't pretend to be happy.\n\nI don't even have to try.\n\n\n\nWhen it rains, I don't mind being lonely.\n\nI cry right along with the sky.\n\nWhen it rains, I don't pretend to be happy.\n\nI don't even have to try.\n\nwhen it rains, some people get down to sportin' a frown.\n\nSo I fit right in.\n\nYeah the sun may brighten your day but if I had my way I'd take the rain."
