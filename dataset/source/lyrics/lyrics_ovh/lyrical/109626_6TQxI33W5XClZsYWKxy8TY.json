  "lyrics": "Living with these shadows\r\nSeparating what I've done\r\nAnd chasing the illusions\r\nOf who I once was\r\nToo much time, too many places\r\nDifferent lives and different faces\n\nStripping down and bracing for a change\n\n\n\nA better life, I'm searching for\n\nA better life, I'm searching for\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be dead to live my life\n\nI pray I'm okay for now\n\nAt least I'm breathing, I'm dying\n\nI'm reaching through myself\n\nThrough another way\n\nI can win and live my life again\n\nSomeday\n\n\n\nLooking for a sign as desperation sets within\n\nBoredom starts to blend [?]\n\nAll this time, all this weather\n\nDrink my wine, I'm no better\n\nEverything around me stays the same\n\n\n\nA better life, I'm searching for\n\nA better life, I'm searching for\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be dead to live my life\n\nI pray I'm okay for now\n\nAt least I'm breathing, I'm dying\n\nI'm reaching through myself\n\nThrough another way\n\nI can win and live my life again\n\nSomeday\n\n\n\nSearching for a life, I need to know\n\nI'm searching of a part of me to find\n\nToo many people with their hands on me\n\nNone of which I really give a shit about anyway\n\n\n\nShedding all my skin to start again and again\n\nShedding all my skin to start again and again\n\nShedding all my skin to start again and again\n\nShedding all my skin to start again and again\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be dead to live my life\n\nI pray I'm okay for now\n\nAt least I'm breathing, I'm dying\n\nI'm reaching through myself\n\nThrough another way\n\nI can win and live my life again\n\nSomeday"
