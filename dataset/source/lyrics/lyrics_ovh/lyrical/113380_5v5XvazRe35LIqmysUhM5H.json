  "lyrics": "What a beautiful noise\r\nComin' up from the street\r\nIt's got a beautiful sound\r\nIt's got a beautiful beat\r\nIt's a beautiful noise\n\nGoin' on ev'rywhere\n\nLike the clickety-clack\n\nOf a train on a track\n\nIt's got rhythm to spare\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful noise\n\nAnd it's a sound that I love\n\nAnd it fits me as well\n\nAs a hand in a glove\n\nYes it does, yes it does\n\n\n\nWhat a beautiful noise\n\nComin' up from the park\n\nIt's the song of the kids\n\nAnd it plays until dark\n\n\n\nIt's the song of the cars\n\nOn their furious flights\n\nBut there's even romance\n\nIn the way that they dance\n\nTo the beat of the lights\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful noise\n\nAnd it's a sound that I love\n\nAnd it makes me feel good\n\nLike a hand in a glove\n\nYes it does, yes it does\n\nWhat a beautiful noise\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful noise\n\nMade of joy and of strife\n\nLike a symphony played\n\nBy the passing parade\n\nIt's the music of life\n\n\n\nIt's a beautiful noise\n\nAnd it's a sound that I love\n\nAnd it makes me feel good\n\nJust like a hand in a glove\n\nYes it does, yes it does\n\nWhat a beautiful noise\n\n\n\nComin' into my room\n\nAnd it's beggin' for me\n\nJust to give it a tune"
