  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson L-Over par U.S. Girls\r\nLove (x15)\n\nMy lover has no heart\nMagic moving blood around that body\nHe's cool to the touch\nI don't see him much\nBut when I do, he does nothing for me\nPersona-driven pleasure\nAnd that's how he gets around\nHe placed me right before the fire\nBut I didn't want to\nI knew how quickly my skin would burn\n\nFire on Stone vs. Fire on Flesh\nMy lover wins the contest\nCan you imagine trying to get\n\nSome satisfaction out of a stone?\nOne would have to wait their whole life and\nI resent you for that\nA swing and a miss\nI weighed all the risks\nWhen I agreed to this charade in the night\n\nMy lover, the time has come\nI hate to break it to you in this way\nDon't ask me\nStop snooping around\nSpare me any talk of your future life\nI don't know what I'll do without you\nTake up worship at some mile's end?\nBut you said “Betrayal & Pride”\nAnd then you took your time\nAnd now I gotta spell it out for you\n\n\nO, I'll only say this once\nV, I'm very sensitive\nE, Everything's a mess\nR, I'm repenting that L 'cos it's over\nMy lover, it's over because\n\nEarly is Early, Late is Late\nMy lover, I got no faith\nCan you imagine trying to get\nSome satisfaction out of a stone?\nOne would have to wait their whole life and\nI don't got time for that\nA swing and a miss\nI tried for the hit\nI got my thrill\nNow get me off of this ride"
