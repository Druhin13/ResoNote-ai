  "lyrics": "Loneliness it shadows me, quicker than darkness \nCrawls to the surface of my skin, visibly surrounded by it \nBlack is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free \nSurrounded by empty souls, artificial courage used \nAnd because so, once was mine \nI walk this maze alone \n\nBlack is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free \n\nThe man's beside himself, man's below himself \n\nMan's behind himself, Am I inside myself \n\nChaos and hate shadow me, pain it fills me up \n\n\n\nOnly one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me \n\nBlack is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free \n\nThe man's beside himself, man's below himself \n\nMan's behind himself, Am I inside myself \n\nChaos and hate shadow me, hate it fills me up \n\nOnly one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me \n\nBlack is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free \n\nThe man's beside himself, man's below himself \n\nMan's behind himself, Am I inside myself"
