  "lyrics": "I hear some people\r\nbeen talkin' me down,\r\nBring up my name,\r\npass it 'round.\r\nThey don't mention\r\nhappy times\n\nThey do their thing,\n\nI'll do mine.\n\n\n\nOoh baby,\n\nthat's hard to change\n\nI can't tell them\n\nhow to feel.\n\nSome get stoned,\n\nsome get strange,\n\nBut sooner or later\n\nit all gets real.\n\n\n\nWalk on, walk on,\n\nWalk on, walk on.\n\n\n\nI remember\n\nthe good old days,\n\nStayed up all night\n\ngettin' crazed.\n\nThen the money\n\nwas not so good,\n\nBut we still did\n\nthe best we could.\n\n\n\nOoh baby,\n\nthat's hard to change\n\nI can't tell them\n\nhow to feel.\n\nSome get stoned,\n\nsome get strange,\n\nBut sooner or later\n\nit all gets real.\n\n\n\nWalk on, walk on,\n\nWalk on, walk on."
