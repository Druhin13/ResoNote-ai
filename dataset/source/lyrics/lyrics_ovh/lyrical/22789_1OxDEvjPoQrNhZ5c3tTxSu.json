  "lyrics": "It won't be easy, you'll think it strange \nWhen I try to explain how I feel \nThat I still need your love after all that I've done \n\n\nYou won't believe me \n\n\n\nAll you will see is a girl you once knew \n\n\n\nAlthough she's dressed up to the nines \n\n\n\nAt sixes and sevens with you \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had to let it happen, I had to change \n\n\n\nCouldn't stay all my life down at heel \n\n\n\nLooking out of the window, staying out of the sun \n\n\n\nSo I chose freedom \n\n\n\nRunning around, trying everything new \n\n\n\nBut nothing impressed me at all \n\n\n\nI never expected it to \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't cry for me Argentina \n\n\n\nThe truth is I never left you \n\n\n\nAll through my wild days \n\n\n\nMy mad existence \n\n\n\nI kept my promise \n\n\n\nDon't keep your distance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd as for fortune, and as for fame \n\n\n\nI never invited them in \n\n\n\nThough it seemed to the world they were all I desired \n\n\n\nThey are illusions \n\n\n\nThey're not the solutions they promised to be \n\n\n\nThe answer was here all the time \n\n\n\nI love you and hope you love me \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't cry for me Argentina \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't cry for me Argentina \n\n\n\nThe truth is I never left you \n\n\n\nAll through my wild days \n\n\n\nMy mad existence \n\n\n\nI kept my promise \n\n\n\nDon't keep your distance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave I said too much \n\n\n\nThere's nothing more I can think of to say to you \n\n\n\nBut all you have to do is look at me to know \n\n\n\nThat every word is true"
