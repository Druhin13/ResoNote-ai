  "lyrics": "If you reach back in your memory\r\nA little bell might ring\r\nAbout a time that once existed\r\nWhen money wasn't king\r\nIf you stretch your imagination\r\nI'll tell you all a tale\n\nAbout a time when everything\n\nWasn't up for sale\n\n\n\nThere was this cat named Johnny\n\nWho loved to play and sing\n\nWhen money wasn't king.\n\n\n\nWe'd all get so excited\n\nWhen John would give a show\n\nWe'd raise the cash between us\n\nAnd down the road we'd go\n\nTo hear him play that music\n\nIt spoke right to my soul\n\nEvery verse a diamond\n\nAnd every chorus gold\n\n\n\nThe sound was my salvation\n\nIt was only everything\n\nBefore money became king.\n\n\n\nWell I ain't sure how it happened\n\nAnd I don't know exactly when\n\nBut everything got bigger\n\nAnd the rules began to bend\n\nAnd the TV taught the people\n\nHow to get their hair to shine\n\nAnd how sweet life can be\n\nIf you keep a tight behind\n\n\n\nAnd they raised the cost of living\n\nAnd how could we have known\n\nThey'd double the price of tickets\n\nTo go see Johnny's show?\n\n\n\nSo we hocked all our possessions\n\nAnd we sold a little dope\n\nAnd went off to rock 'n' roll.\n\n\n\nWe arrived there early\n\nIn time to see rehearsal\n\nAnd John came out and lip-synched\n\nHis new lite-beer commercial\n\nAnd as the crowd arrived\n\nAs far as I could see\n\nThe faces were all different\n\nThere was no one there like me\n\n\n\nThey sat in golden circles\n\nAnd waiters served them wine\n\nAnd talked through all the music\n\nAnd to John paid little mind\n\nAnd way up in the nosebleeds\n\nWe watched upon the screen\n\nThey hung between the billboards\n\nSo cheaper seats could see\n\n\n\nJohnny, rock that golden circle\n\nAnd all those VIPs\n\nAnd that music that had freed us\n\nBecame a tired routine\n\nAnd I saw his face in close-up\n\nTryin' to give it all he had\n\nAnd sometimes his eyes betrayed him\n\nYou could see that he was sad\n\n\n\nAnd I tried to rock on with him\n\nBut I slowly became bored\n\nCould that man on stage with everything\n\nSomehow need some more?\n\n\n\nThere was no use in pretending\n\nNo magic left to hear\n\nAll the music gave me\n\nWas a craving for lite-beer\n\nAs I walked out of the arena\n\nMy ears began to ring\n\nAnd money became king."
