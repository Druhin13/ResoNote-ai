  "lyrics": "Never said what I was thinking, and now you turned up at my door\r\nI can tell that you’d been drinking, as we went crashing to the floor\r\nYou came from Santa Monica, teardrops in your eyes\r\nWe passed out in the shadows of a lonely Thursday night\r\nWe kissed away our memories and fucked away the pain\n\nWe went out for some coffee and we did it all again\n\n\n\nMy Krystalline\n\nOhhh, I want you Krystalline\n\nOhhh, I want you Krystalline\n\n\n\nCouldn’t tell what you were thinking the night I turned up at the bar\n\nI told you I quit drinking and you laughed ‘til you saw stars\n\nI came to Santa Monica with flowers in my hand\n\nI grabbed you by the lips with mine and slowly pulled you in\n\n\n\nWe kissed away our memories and fucked away the pain\n\nYou called in sick to work and then we did it all again\n\n\n\nMy Krystalline\n\nOhhh, I want you Krystalline\n\nOhhh, I want you Krystalline\n\nOhhh, I want you Krystalline\n\nOhhh, I want you Krystalline"
