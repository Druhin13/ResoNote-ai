  "lyrics": "Your love shines in darkest places, reaching for my heart\r\nIn Your light I find the pieces, every missing part\r\nAnd hope is found in hopeless places, everywhere You are\r\nTake my hand and lead me forward, forward to the start\r\n'Cause I need You, I need You\n\nIt only takes a moment\n\nFor You to fix what's broken in me\n\nI need You\n\n\n\nIf You can give the blind man vision, then open up my eyes\n\nLead me out beyond my questions, where faith will be my sight\n\nIf You can heal the weak and wounded, You can heal my heart\n\nTake my hand and lead me forward, forward to the start\n\n\n\nI need You, I need You\n\nIt only takes a moment\n\nFor You to fix what's broken in me\n\nI need You\n\n\n\nYou've been there from the beginning, You have walked this road\n\nCall my name and I'll keep running, 'til I'm finally home\n\n\n\nI need You, I need You\n\nI need You, I need You\n\nIt only takes a moment\n\nFor You to fix what's broken\n\nIt only takes a moment\n\nFor You to fix what's broken in me\n\nAnd I need You"
