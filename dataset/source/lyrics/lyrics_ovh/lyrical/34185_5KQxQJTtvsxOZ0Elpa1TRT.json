  "lyrics": "I was buried beneath my shame\r\nWho could carry that kind of weight?\r\nIt was my tomb 'til I met You\r\nI was breathing but not alive\r\nAll my failures I tried to hide\n\nIt was my tomb 'til I met You\n\n\n\nYou called my name and I ran out of that grave\n\nOut of the darkness into Your glorious day\n\nYou called my name and I ran out of that grave\n\nOut of the darkness into Your glorious day\n\n\n\nNow Your mercy has saved my soul\n\nNow Your freedom is all I know\n\nThe old made new, Jesus, when I met You\n\n\n\nYou called my name and I ran out of that grave\n\nOut of the darkness into Your glorious day\n\nYou called my name and I ran out of that grave\n\nOut of the darkness into Your glorious day\n\n\n\nI needed rescue, my sin was heavy\n\nBut chains break at the weight of Your glory\n\nI needed shelter, I was an orphan\n\nNow You call me a citizen of heaven\n\nWhen I was broken, You were my healing\n\nNow Your love is the air that I'm breathing\n\nI have a future, my eyes are open...\n\n\n\nâ€˜Cause when You called my name, I ran out of that grave\n\nOut of the darkness into Your glorious day\n\nYou called my name and I ran out of that grave\n\nOut of the darkness into Your glorious day\n\n\n\nYour glorious day\n\nInto Your glorious day!"
