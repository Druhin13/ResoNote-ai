  "lyrics": "The howling moon would cry\r\nI'd sleep the sun away\r\nI was just a child\r\nI knew I was afraid\r\nThere was nothin' to gain, I found\r\nBy runnin' the other way\n\nI had to stand my ground\n\nAnd keep the wolves at bay\n\n\n\nBut I knew somehow\n\nThere would come a day\n\nSo I stood my ground\n\nKept the wolves at bay\n\n\n\nWould not take no more\n\nHad my fill\n\nStars had faded from my eyes\n\nAnd run from looks that kill\n\nThere was no one comin' around\n\nTo save me from the fray\n\nI had to stand my ground\n\nAnd keep the wolves at bay\n\n\n\nWell, I knew somehow\n\nThere would come a day\n\nWhen I stood my ground\n\nKept the wolves at bay\n\nWell, I knew somehow\n\nThere would come a day\n\nSo I stood my ground\n\nKept the wolves at bay\n\n\n\nYears have gone by\n\nThe callin' carries on\n\nScars above my eye\n\nAre tender to the bone\n\nAnd though I've settled down\n\nI hear the children say\n\nYou have to stand your ground\n\nAnd keep the wolves at bay\n\n\n\nWell, I knew somehow\n\nThere would come the day\n\nWhen I stood my ground\n\nKept the wolves at bay\n\nWell I knew somehow\n\nThere would come the day\n\nSo I stood my ground\n\nKept the wolves at bay"
