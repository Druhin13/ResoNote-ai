  "lyrics": "Now no one ever said that it was gonna be picture perfect\r\nI had a decent past, my daddy never tried to hurt me\r\nI wasn't a victim or a product of domestic pain\r\nSo what if I was bullied, pushedf around and sticked and stoned with names\r\nThey never broke my bones but I fell hard and got back up\r\nAnd stitched myself together with these open mics and sampled cuts\n\nI found the other me lurking underneath the stairs\n\nLike another Jekyll that was Hyding in the kicks and shares\n\nA combination of my blood mixed with sweat and tears\n\nWas the potion that released the anger from my deepest fears\n\nSo flip the switch and push my buttons for a deadly ride\n\n'Cause I've been looking for a reason to release the beast inside\n\n\n\nCome on if it's a fight you need\n\nI'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream\n\nIf you wanna hear the sirens scream, well\n\nStep up and meet the monster in me\n\nCome on if it's a fight you need\n\nI'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream\n\nIf you wanna hear the sirens scream, well\n\nStep up and meet the monster in me\n\n\n\nDon't try to figure me out, boy, you know that I'm crazy\n\nTake my kindness for weakness and you'll be pushing up daisies\n\nI hate lies and deceit like a thief in the night\n\nI'm one hell of a problem when you cross me just right\n\nIn the full moon light better get your silver bullets\n\n'Cause you know when I'm triggered then I'm fixing to pull it\n\nDon't talk behind my back if you can't say it to my face\n\nLike mistakes in my past I can have you erased\n\nHurt the ones that I love, I'll introduce you to pain\n\nGet me off of my rocker, I'm going more than insane\n\nSo crawl up in your bed and hide under your sheets\n\nI'll be the terror that takes you when you slip off to sleep\n\n\n\nCome on if it's a fight you need\n\nI'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream\n\nIf you wanna hear the sirens scream, well\n\nStep up and meet the monster in me\n\nCome on if it's a fight you need\n\nI'm all in, I'm the nightmare when you dream\n\nIf you wanna hear the sirens scream, well\n\nStep up and meet the monster in me"
