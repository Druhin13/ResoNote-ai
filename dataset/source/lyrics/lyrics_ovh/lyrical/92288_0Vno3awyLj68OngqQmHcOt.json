  "lyrics": "I've been feelin' like it's impossible to say, you know\r\nAnd I'm losing all control\r\n'Cause I wish that I could break the fall and save it all\r\nBut I've been holding it too close\r\nWish I knew what you're thinking\n\nWords don't come that easy\n\nWe might be broken by design\n\nI can't help how I'm feeling\n\nScared of my own reasons\n\nI don't wanna waste your time\n\n\n\nSearching for\n\nAnother way, another way, another way\n\nTo keep us safe\n\nAnother day, another day, another day\n\nIt's easier\n\nTo run away, run away, run away\n\nThan to know what to say, say, say\n\nThan to know what to say\n\n\n\nI just lie awake and play it out in my head\n\nLike I know what to do\n\nBut the world has got a different plan for me and you\n\nAnd it hurts when it's true\n\n\n\nI don't know what you're thinking\n\nWords don't come that easy\n\nWe might be broken by design\n\nI can't help how I'm feeling\n\nScared of my own reasons\n\nI don't wanna waste your time\n\n\n\nSearching for\n\nAnother way, another way, another way\n\nTo keep us safe\n\nAnother day, another day, another day\n\nIt's easier\n\nTo run away, run away, run away\n\nThan to know what to say, say, say\n\n\n\n(Say, say, say)\n\n(Say, say, say)\n\n\n\nSearching for\n\nAnother way, another way, another way\n\nTo keep us safe\n\nAnother day, another day, another day\n\nIt's easier\n\nTo run away, run away, run away\n\nThan to know what to say, say, say\n\nThan to know what to say, say, say\n\nTo know what to say, say, say"
