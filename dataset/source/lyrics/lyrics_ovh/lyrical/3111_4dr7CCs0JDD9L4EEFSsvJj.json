  "lyrics": "New mama's got a sun in her eyes\r\nNo clouds are in my changing skies\r\nEach morning when I wake up to rise\r\nI'm livin' in a dreamland.\r\nChanging times,\n\nancient reasons,\n\nthat turn to lies\n\nThrow them all away\n\nHead in hand,\n\ngift of wonders to understand\n\nAnd open all the way.\n\n\n\nNew mama's got a sun in her eyes\n\nNo clouds are in my changing skies\n\nEach morning when I wake up to rise\n\nI'm livin' in a dreamland."
