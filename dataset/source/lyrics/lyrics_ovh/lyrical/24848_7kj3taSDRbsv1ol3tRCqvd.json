  "lyrics": "Does anyone know where the new guy went?\r\nHe kicked down the front door and took off again\r\nI don't know how he will ever win\r\nBut the man I used to know loved an argument\r\nI think he believes that I'm a billionaire\n\nAnd that I've a new house that's up in the air\n\nOne day soon I might drive him there\n\nI think he needs to get out of town\n\n\n\nBut what do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nDoes anyone know where the new guy went?\n\nHe shuffles in circles so he'll be round again\n\nAnd you go that away, I'll go against the wind\n\nThe man I used to know would never give in\n\n\n\nAnd I think he believes that I'm a billionaire\n\nAnd that I've a new house that's up in the air\n\nOne day soon I might drive him there\n\nI think he needs to get out of town\n\n\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nEverytthing is fine, thank you for asking\n\nOf all the years to miss out on, you did well\n\nAllow me one great life, you're not quite gone\n\nYou're not quite gone\n\n\n\nI think he believes that I'm a billionaire\n\nAnd that I've a new house that's up in the air\n\nOne day soon I might drive him there\n\nI think he needs to get out of town\n\n\n\nI think he believes that I'm a billionaire\n\nAnd that I've a new house that's up in the air\n\nOne day soon I might drive him there\n\nI think he needs to get out of town\n\n\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nI think he needs to get out of town"
