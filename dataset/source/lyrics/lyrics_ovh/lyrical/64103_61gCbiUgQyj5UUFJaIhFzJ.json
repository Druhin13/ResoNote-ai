Wine, all kinds of wine! Mixed, seven different varieties . . . Thunderbird wine . . . I don't know but I chugged a fifth of White Port once and passed out one day (heh heh) . . . and I drank a quart of beer just before that . . . and we were out riding around in the desert . . .\n\n\n\n. . . very strange! Anyway . . .\n\n\n\nTry and imagine\n\nThe window all covered in green\n\nAll the time he would spend\n\nAt the church he'd attend . . .\n\nWarming his pew\n\n\n\nKenny will feed him & Ronnie will watch\n\nTHE CHILD WILL THRIVE & GROW\n\nAnd enter the world\n\nOf liars & cheaters & people like you\n\nWho smile & think you know\n\nWhat this is about\n\n\n\n(YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING . . . maybe so)\n\nThe song we sing: DO YOU KNOW?\n\nWe're listening . . .\n\nTHE IDIOT BOY!\n\n\n\nTry and imagine\n\nThe window all covered in green\n\nAll the time he would spend\n\nAll the colors he'd blend . . .\n\nWhere are they now?\n\n\n\nGary Kellgren: Right now I have two hit records on the charts, but it has not made me any money. It has only brought me fame and glory, and a lot of work. Which I do, really not care to tell . . ."
