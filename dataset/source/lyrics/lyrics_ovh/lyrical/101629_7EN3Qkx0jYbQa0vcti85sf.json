  "lyrics": "A relationship is a 50/50 thing\r\nI don't wanna be the girl always giving in to you\r\nSame old same, it's a daily train\r\nWaiting on your ring, it's just a losing game\r\nI don't wanna pick up, but then I pick up\n\nI don't wanna give up, should I give up?\n\nIt's just a chase, a Tom & Jerry race\n\nWill it, will it ever, ever change?\n\n\n\nI bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on\n\nI bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone\n\nI bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor\n\nIf I said \"get lost,\" if I slammed that door\n\nMaybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less\n\nYou would care a little more\n\n\n\nIf I had a hand that didn't want a ring\n\nYou wouldn't be cool with a five-month fling, yeah\n\nWhat we have is just a rush, yeah\n\nJust a touch but not enough\n\n\n\nI let my heart out and then you wigged out\n\nI gave my all to you, but if I said \"see ya\"\n\nJust like that, would you be back?\n\nAll looking sad and trying to last\n\n\n\nI bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on\n\nI bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone\n\nI bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor\n\nIf I said \"get lost,\" if I slammed that door\n\nMaybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less\n\nYou would care a little more\n\n\n\nWhoa, a little more\n\n\n\nMaybe I should care less and be careless\n\nMaybe I should care less and be careless\n\nMaybe I should care less and be careless\n\n\n\nI bet if I turned this heart off, baby, it would turn you on\n\nI bet if I blocked you, you'd be blowing up my best friend's phone, yeah\n\nI bet you'd be on your knees, on that floor\n\nIf I said \"get lost,\" if I slammed that door\n\nMaybe if I cared less, maybe if I care less\n\nYou would care a little more\n\n\n\nWhoa, a little more\n\nYeah, yeah"
