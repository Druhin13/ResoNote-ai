  "lyrics": "Memphis in June\rA shade veranda under Sunday blue sky\rMemphis in June\rAnd my cousin Miranda she's making a blueberry pie\rI can see the clock outside a ticking and a tocking\rEverything so peaceful and dandy\rI can see my grandmama 'cross the street still a rocking\rWatching all the neighbours go by oh my\rMemphis in June\rSweet oleander blowing perfume in the air everywhere\rUp jumps the moon to make it so much grander\rIt's paradise honey take my advice honey\rCos there's nothing loke old Memphis in June"
