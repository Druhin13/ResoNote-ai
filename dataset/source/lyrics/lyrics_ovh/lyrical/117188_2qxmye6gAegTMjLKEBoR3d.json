  "lyrics": "This night is cold in the kingdom\r\nI can feel you fade away\r\nFrom the kitchen to the bathroom sink and\r\nYour steps keep me awake\r\nDon't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste\n\nI was once a man with dignity and grace\n\nNow I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace\n\nSo please, please\n\n\n\nCould you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nA little sympathy, I hope you can show me\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nLet me down, down\n\nLet me down, down\n\nLet me down, let me down\n\nDown, let me down, down\n\nLet me down\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nCold skin, drag my feet on the tile\n\nAs I'm walking down the corridor\n\nAnd I know we haven't talked in a while\n\nSo I'm looking for an open door\n\n\n\nDon't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste\n\nI was once a man with dignity and grace\n\nNow I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace\n\nSo please, please\n\n\n\nCould you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nA little sympathy, I hope you can show me\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nLet me down, down\n\nLet me down, down\n\nLet me down, let me down\n\nDown, let me down, down\n\nLet me down\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\n\n\nCould you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nA little sympathy, I hope you can show me\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nLet me down, down\n\nLet me down, down\n\nLet me down, let me down\n\nDown, let me down, down\n\nLet me down\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nIf you wanna go then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving baby let me down slowly"
