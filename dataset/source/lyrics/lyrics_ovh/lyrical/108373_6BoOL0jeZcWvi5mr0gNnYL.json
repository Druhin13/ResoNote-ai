  "lyrics": "She doesn't own a dress, her hair is always a mess\r\nIf you catch her stealin, she won't confess\r\nShe's beautiful\r\nSmokes a pack a day, but wait thats me, but anyway,\r\nshe doesn't care a thing about that hey,\r\nshe thinks I'm beautiful\n\nMeet Virginia\n\nShe never compromises, loves babies and surprises\n\nWears hi-heels when she exercises\n\nAin't that beautiful\n\nMeet Virginia\n\nWell she wants to be the Queen\n\nThen she thinks about her scene\n\nPulls her hair back as she screams\n\nI don't really wanna be the queen\n\nHer daddy wrestles alligators, Mama works on carburetors\n\nHer brother is a fine mediator for the President\n\nWell here she is again on the phone\n\nJust like me hates to be alone\n\nWe just like to sit at home, and rip on the President\n\nMeet Virginia\n\nWell she wants to live her life\n\nThen she thinks about her life\n\nPulls her hair back as she screams\n\nI don't really wanna live this life\n\nShe only drinks coffee at Midnight, when the moment is not\n\nright, her timing is quite-unusual\n\nyou see her confidence is tragic, but her intuition magic\n\nand the shape of her body - unusual\n\nMeet Virginia-I can't wait to\n\nMeet Virginia-Yea\n\n\n\nChorus I & 2"
