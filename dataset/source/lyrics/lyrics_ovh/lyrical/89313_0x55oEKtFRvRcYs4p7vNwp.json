(Yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nI remember, no matter what, it's me and you\n\n(I remember, yes, I remember)\n\n\n\nDancing under the stars\n\nKissing you in the dark\n\nI remember your love, oh\n\nNever giving you up, giving you up, oh\n\nDancing under the stars (Yeah)\n\nKissing you in the dark\n\nI remember your love, oh\n\nNever giving you up, giving you up (Oh)\n\n\n\nI remember nobody loves me like you do\n\n(I remember, I remember)\n\nI remember I don't want perfect, I want you (I want you)\n\n(I remember, yes, I remember)\n\nYou know you're the only one\n\nHow could I forget this love? (Yeah, yeah, oh)\n\nI remember, no matter what, it's me and you\n\n(I remember, yes, I remember)\n\nNo matter what, no matter what\n\n\n\nDancing under the stars (Oh, yeah)\n\nKissing you in the dark\n\nI remember your love, oh\n\nNever giving you up, giving you up, oh"
