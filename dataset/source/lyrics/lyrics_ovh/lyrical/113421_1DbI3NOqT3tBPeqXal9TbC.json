  "lyrics": "Strings attached, fake eye lashes\r\nBroke apart the piggie bank for petty cash\r\nSensitive sister blush, and don't stare\r\nWatch the children squabblin' in the square\r\nTip my hat, low windows\n\nOnce I saw you naked, there was nothing to show\n\nPiano plays, sonata tempo\n\nOf all the girls of in our class she's the most refined\n\n\n\nI'd like to be there in the morning when you wake up\n\nMaybe pipe dream, but come easter we could pack up\n\nI'd like to be there in the morning when you wake up\n\nMaybe pipe dream, but come easter we could pack up\n\n\n\nI like to show up at your door step\n\nWearing the winter tie my neighbour tied\n\nAnd meet your family, compliment cookin'\n\nDrink the beer your uncles are brewin'\n\n\n\nFlat-out refused to take that job\n\nJust because i'm poor don't mean I can't be a snob\n\nStrawberry hair, fair freckled skin\n\nWaiting like a creep outside catillian\n\n\n\nShy expression, shawl on her shoulders\n\nBought this house with money that your grandfather stole\n\nMuch too young, save the imagination\n\nRuined an elegant girl's reputation\n\n\n\nI'd like to be there in the morning when you wake up\n\nMaybe pipe dream, but come easter we could pack up\n\n\n\nWoah, woah\n\nWoah, oh\n\nWoah, oh\n\nWoah, oh\n\n\n\nAnd when they ask me my occupation\n\nI'm a prayin man working on my patience\n\nI got no preference, politic party\n\nParents take away my car keys\n\n\n\nMass lets out, rollin' smokes for trades\n\nDrink my weight coffee at the penny arcade\n\nRows of shoes, shelves of jewerly\n\nMama's dying her hair in the vanity\n\n\n\nDaddy's watch too tight, try silver spoon for size\n\nHarder than a needle through a camel's eye\n\nFolks gather around the table, find a place\n\nBoys that girl don't have expensive tastes"
