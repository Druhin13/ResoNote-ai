  "lyrics": "Today I'm sleeping in\r\nI'll wake up with the world on fire\r\nAnd I'll listen to music instead of the news\r\nCause I have been here before\r\nChasing dreams, you can get so tired\r\nToo tired to tell the dreams coming true\n\n\n\nYeah I got careless\n\nI pushed you away to live for the day\n\nBut tonight I can't bear this\n\nYeah I'm breaking free\n\nBut what good is free if I cannot share it\n\nWith you\n\nA cloud on the sun in a sky so blue\n\nI was careless\n\nSo careless with you\n\n\n\nIf I could do this again\n\nEvery chord, every note, every page\n\nEvery song that I sing, I would sing them for you\n\nSo I will steady my pen\n\nWrite these words from your busted bird cage\n\nAnd I'll watch the world pass from the bars you broke through\n\n\n\n'Cause I got careless\n\nI pushed you away to live for the day\n\nBut tonight I can't bear this\n\nYeah I'm breaking free\n\nBut what good is free if I cannot share it\n\nWith you\n\nA cloud on the sun in a sky so blue\n\nI was careless\n\nSo careless with you\n\n\n\nWhen the gold of daylight breaks\n\nFeel the sunshine on my face\n\nWill you take me back?\n\nEven after all of my mistakes?\n\n\n\nYeah I got careless\n\nI pushed you away to live for the day\n\nBut tonight I can't bear this\n\nYeah I'm breaking free\n\nBut what good is free if I cannot share it\n\nWith you\n\nA cloud on the sun in a sky so blue\n\nI was careless\n\nSo careless with you"
