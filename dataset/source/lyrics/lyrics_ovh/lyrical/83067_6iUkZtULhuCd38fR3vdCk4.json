  "lyrics": "Hey yeah.. ohh ahh..\r\nThere is ice, alive, turn ice into fire\r\nI want, I need, to feel such desire\r\nA pain lies deep, in the heart of my soul\r\nThis truth, unfolds, and I'm losing control\n\nAnd I'm losing control..\n\n\n\nI drift in this place, I can't see ahead\n\nSearching around, for the answers..\n\n\n\n[x2]\n\nAnd it's cold, outside, and I feel the winter\n\nThere's a chill, in the air, of secrets untold\n\n\n\nHey yeah.. ohh ahh..\n\n\n\nTonight, I crave, sunlight on my face\n\nFor I, can see, it's lonely in space\n\nA touch, can make, the senses awake\n\nBut fear, controls, your every mistake\n\nYour every mistake..\n\n\n\nI drift in this place, I can't see ahead\n\nSearching around, for the answers..\n\n\n\n[x4]\n\nAnd it's cold, outside, and I feel the winter\n\nThere's a chill, in the air, of secrets untold\n\n\n\nHey yeah.. ohh ahh..\n\n\n\nAnd it's cold outside.. and it's cold, outside\n\nAnd it's cold outside..\n\n\n\n[x4]\n\nWinter.. I feel the winter"
