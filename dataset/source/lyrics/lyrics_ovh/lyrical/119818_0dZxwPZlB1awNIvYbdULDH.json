  "lyrics": "Couldn't wait to ride out of that one horse town\r\nDidn't see no use in sticking around\r\nI was green and busting at the seams to leave\r\nI was sitting on G, waiting on O\r\nThe day I hit eighteen, I hit the road\r\nTraded that county maintain for a four lane city street\n\n\n\nBut sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be\n\nWhat you want ain't always what you need\n\n\n\nDon't know what you got 'til it's gone\n\nAnd you're out on your own\n\nAll you want is what you can't get back\n\nOnce you let it go, then you know what you have\n\nDon't hold a candle to what you had\n\nSometimes what you think you'll find\n\nIt ain't quite what real life has in store\n\nSo be careful what you wish for\n\n\n\nShe was holding on just a little too tight\n\nTalked a little too much about the rest of our lives\n\nI broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free\n\nWell sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be\n\n\n\nDon't know what you got 'til it's gone\n\nAnd you're out on your own\n\nAll you want is what you can't get back\n\nOnce you let it go, then you know what you have\n\nDon't hold a candle to what you had\n\nSometimes what you think you'll find\n\nIt ain't quite what real life has in store\n\nSo be careful what you wish for\n\n\n\n'Cause these city lights can't shine quite like the stars\n\nI wish I could wish her back into my arms\n\n\n\nDon't know what you got 'til it's gone\n\nAnd you're out on your own\n\nAll you want is what you can't get back\n\nOnce you let it go, then you know what you have\n\nDon't hold a candle to what you had\n\nSometimes what you think you'll find\n\nIt ain't quite what real life has in store\n\nAnd you can't get her back no more\n\nSo be careful what you wish for\n\nBe careful what you wish for"
