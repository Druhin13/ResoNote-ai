  "lyrics": "Bang bang, you always shot me down so carefully\r\nSo I... bled out, and didn't even realize\r\nI gave you all of the things that you want\r\nAnd you gave me nothin'\r\nNow there's somethin' never left that's unsaid\r\nAnd it's on my mind\n\n\n\nFuck you for thinkin' that I\n\nWould be cool and let you in\n\nAnd fuck you for every time\n\nThat you got under my skin\n\nAnd I know that I said I would always be your friend\n\nBut I guess that you used all your chances in the end, so\n\nFuck you for wastin' my time\n\nFuck you for everything\n\n\n\nYou came rushing through my home like a hurricane\n\nNow I got these flowers growing from my scars\n\nOh funny how you think now that you got me\n\nRight where you want me\n\nBut there's just one thing, listen in\n\nI know who you are\n\n\n\nFuck you for thinkin' that I\n\nWould be cool and let you in\n\nAnd fuck you for every time\n\nThat you got under my skin\n\nAnd I know that I said I would always be your friend\n\nBut I guess that you used all your chances in the end, so\n\nFuck you for wastin' my time\n\nFuck you for everything\n\n\n\nFuck you for thinkin' that I\n\nWould be cool and let you in\n\nAnd fuck you for every time\n\nThat you got under my skin\n\nAnd I know that I said I would always be your friend\n\nBut I guess that you used all your chances in the end, so\n\nFuck you for wastin' my time\n\nFuck you for everything"
