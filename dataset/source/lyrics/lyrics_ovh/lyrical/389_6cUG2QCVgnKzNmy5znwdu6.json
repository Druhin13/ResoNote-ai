  "lyrics": "Bathe myself in the afternoon\r\nWon't get out until the water's cold and I am blue\r\nI see it, I'm killing doubts\r\nSo I just open up the door and I ring it out\r\nDon't you get too far from yourself\n\nYou're so hard on yourself\n\nOh, you'll get through\n\nOnly hard when you say it's too hard\n\n\n\nColour in, colour in\n\nFeeling empty outside of your outline\n\nYou scratch at the door of the divine\n\nWithin, colour in\n\nYou can't stand the greatness of sunshine\n\nYou hide in the bones of a stock image\n\n\n\nShave my head in your bathroom\n\nSweep my hair under your bed\n\nLook in the mirror till I forget\n\nEverything I know, everything I did\n\nWas just a way to make the time feel faster\n\n\n\nOh, you'll get through\n\nOnly hard when you say it's too hard\n\n\n\nColour in, colour in\n\nFeeling empty outside of your outline\n\nYou scratch at the door of the divine\n\nWithin, colour in\n\nYou can't stand the greatness of sunshine\n\nYou hide in the bones of a stock image\n\nOf a stock image\n\nYou hide in the bones of a stock image\n\n\n\nBathe myself in the afternoon\n\nWon't get out until the water's cold and I am blue\n\nI see it, I'm killing doubts\n\nSo I just open up the door\n\n\n\nColour in, colour in\n\nFeeling empty outside of your outline\n\nYou scratch at the door of the divine\n\nWithin, colour in\n\nYou can't stand the greatness of sunshine\n\nYou hide in the bones of a stock image\n\nOf a stock image\n\nYou hide in the bones of a stock image"
