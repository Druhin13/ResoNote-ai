  "lyrics": "I can feel you getting closer\r\nI can sense you start to smile\r\nI see colossal eyes\r\nCalm down, don't run again\r\nI'll soothe you, I'm mechanical\n\nBrave soldier, kill again\n\nBefore we all expire\n\n\n\nThink for yourself\n\nAnd be the renegade\n\nDon't give in to him\n\nAnd his ugly ways\n\n\n\nI can feel you getting closer\n\nI can sense you start to smile\n\nI see colossal eyes\n\nThere's a shadow on the sun\n\nAnd no wonder why\n\n\n\nDrain all the sick away\n\nYou've proven you are an animal\n\nWatching me, you are a mannequin\n\nYour form is menacing\n\n\n\nThis is another one of his ways\n\nTo control me\n\n\n\nI can feel you getting closer\n\nI can sense you start to smile\n\nI see colossal eyes\n\nThere's a shadow on the sun\n\nAnd no wonder why"
