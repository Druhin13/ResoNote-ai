  "lyrics": "If the weather's as bad as the weatherman says, we're in for a real mean storm\r\nIf the times are as hard as folks are saying they are, some folks have it real, real hard\r\nCan't even get a break, forget about getting ahead--you bet they never get too far\r\nIf the people upstairs acted like they even cared, I'd crack a real wide smile\r\nBut I'd have to guess, to witness something like this, you'd have to wait a real long while\n\n\n\nIf life is as tough as the last couple months, we're in for a real rough year\n\n\n\nIf the future's as bleak as I hear on the street, we're looking at a real long haul\n\nThe people I speak to take drugs when they need to stop thinking about it all\n\nMe? I've taken a few so I could stop thinking too--who hasn't used a drug?\n\nBut turning off yr mind a couple few too many times can turn you to a real dumb slug\n\n\n\nIf things are as bad as the newspaper says, we're in for a real big war\n\n\n\nIf this is the shit that we're to be dealing with then we made a real bad deal\n\nBut shit isn't new until it happens to you, spinning like a reel-to-reel\n\nIf we could stop this train and start all over again, make all of the states shake hands\n\nWell, I'd smile real wide although I know, down deep inside, that happening has a real slim chance\n\n\n\nIt's a real big war that they've got in store for us"
