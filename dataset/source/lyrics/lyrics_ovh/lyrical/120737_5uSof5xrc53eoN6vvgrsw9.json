  "lyrics": "You wanna see what over looks like?\r\nYa ain't gotta go far, just a few blocks down\r\nYou wanna see a picture of goodbye?\r\nChairs on the table\r\nSmoke hanging round the ceiling from the night before\r\nLight coming through the crack in the door\n\n\n\nNothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it\n\nNothing says gone like an empty glass\n\nOr sitting on the bar in the middle of the day\n\nIn a blue light haze, oh lord\n\nNothing says gone like high noon neon\n\n\n\nShe could be an airplane blur\n\nWind in her hair, blowing through another town\n\nOr staring out over a wind, tears on her face\n\nHead in the clouds\n\nIt doesn't really matter now\n\n\n\nNothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it\n\nNothing says gone like an empty glass\n\nOr sitting on the bar in the middle of the day\n\nIn a blue light haze, oh lord\n\nNothing says gone like high noon neon\n\n\n\nAnd nothing says gone like 12 o clock on the rocks\n\nAnd nothing says over like a parking lot with only one car in it\n\nNothing says gone like an empty glass\n\nOr sitting on the bar in the middle of the day\n\nIn a blue light haze, oh lord\n\nNothing says gone like high noon neon"
