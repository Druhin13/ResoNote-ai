  "lyrics": "You're no true soul, you'll never be\r\nMan-made device, you've haunted me\r\nYou're built to serve, to calculate\r\nYou're built to love, to overtake\r\nStay with me for I would never ever leave you\n\nHold my hand for I would never ever let it see an end\n\nOh, you are mine, oh, I could never ever leave you behind\n\nOh, stay with me for I would never ever leave you\n\n\n\nLook at you now, you're a dying machine\n\nCold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased\n\nAgain, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place\n\nMechanical cradle, synthetic embrace\n\nYou're a dying machine, you're a dying machine\n\n\n\nThe years go by, you follow me\n\nManufactured eyes see everything\n\nYour corroding core degenerates\n\nProgrammed to love and terminate\n\n\n\nOh, I must stay for I could never ever turn your love away\n\nOh, you're the one for I could never ever see your love undone\n\nI'm not your fool and I could never ever say a thing so cruel\n\nSo, stay with me 'cause I am never ever gonna leave you\n\n\n\nLook at you now, you're a dying machine\n\nCold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased\n\nAgain, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place\n\nMechanical cradle, synthetic embrace\n\nYou're a dying machine, you're a dying machine\n\nYou're a dying machine, you're a dying machine\n\n\n\nAs deep as any ocean\n\nLike the promise of the morning sun, never ending, never done\n\nThe skin of my devotion\n\nI crave until we love again, follow to the bitter end\n\n\n\nLike walking in a nightmare\n\nA travesty, a shell born dead, fabricated, interbred\n\nRelentless as you like it\n\nNever ending, never gone\n\nNever changing, never done\n\nNever changing, never done\n\n\n\nLook at you now, you're a dying machine\n\nCold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased\n\nAgain, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place\n\nMechanical cradle, synthetic embrace\n\nYou're a dying machine, you're a dying machine\n\nYou're a dying machine, you're a dying machine"
