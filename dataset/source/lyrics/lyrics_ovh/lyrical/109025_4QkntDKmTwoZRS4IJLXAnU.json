  "lyrics": "New York snow this time of year\r\nThere's nothing more beautiful to me\r\nExcept for you\r\nMakin' my way uptown and down\r\nSeein' familiar places, faces\n\nIn my pile of coffee grounds\n\n\n\nThe days are better the nights are still so lonely\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\n\n\nWatchin' my breath rise in the sun\n\nPullin' myself in to make warm\n\nHelplessly feel for my phone and drive away\n\n\n\nThis new rhythm I pursue\n\nIs just my gettin' over you \n\nTellin' myself that I need to\n\n\n\nThe days are better the nights are still so lonely\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\n\n\nI'm still lookin' for -\n\nDon't wanna say I -\n\nTo be alone\n\n\n\nThe days are better the nights are still so lonely\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\nThe days are better the nights are still so lonely\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road\n\nSometimes I think I'm the only cab on the road"
