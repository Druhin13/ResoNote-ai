  "lyrics": "'Cause the deals we made to shake things up\r\nIn the rights that they abuse\r\nMight just fuck us over\r\nBut the doors won't shut\r\nUntil they're sure there's nothing left to use\r\nSomeone's taking over\n\nThrew it away, but now I say\n\nIt's time to hand it over\n\n\n\nThe joke's worn thin, the king stepped in\n\nOh, we'll see who is who\n\nLook who's bending over\n\n\n\nBut the stars weren't wrong, the time felt right\n\nWe both know it was true\n\nThe smart ones exit early\n\nAnd the rest hope for a shoulder\n\n\n\nIf we lose our touch, it won't mean much\n\nIf everyone's confused\n\nWhich door do we open?\n\n\n\nIt's the time same old trick\n\nThey played the hand\n\nNow there's one thing to left to do\n\n\n\nIt's time (Hand it over)\n\nIt's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)\n\nOne thing on my mind (Hand it over)\n\nIt's rightfully mine (Hand it over)\n\nIn the dark (Hand it over)\n\nWhat's yours is mine (Hand it over)\n\nMake it right (Hand it over)\n\nAnd give me what's mine (Hand it over)\n\n\n\nOh, this time (Hand it over)\n\nIt's yours and mine (Hand it over)\n\nHey, it's time to hand it over\n\nJust give me what's mine (Hand it over)\n\nMmm, anytime (Hand it over)\n\nIt's yours and it's mine (Hand it over)\n\nOoh, I need time (Hand it over)\n\nNo, it's rightfully mine (Hand it over)\n\nOh, anytime"
