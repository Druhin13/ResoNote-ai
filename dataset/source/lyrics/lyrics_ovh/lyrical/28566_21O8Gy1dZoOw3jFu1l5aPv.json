  "lyrics": "In the backseat of a car\nWith a girl that has a scar,\nPredicting that we won't get far,\nIf I would throw up we could share,\nBut have no expectations.\n\n\nI can see clearly when I'm drunk,\n\nI have no expectations,\n\nI promised fear, but let you down,\n\nI have no obligations.\n\nWhen I see children to be ground,\n\nI have no expectations.\n\nWhen out in space you will miss sound.\n\n\n\nIn that jumpsuit you can't win,\n\nJesus died for all your sin.\n\nI feel better without god.\n\nKann nicht auf Deutsch zu sprechen,\n\nBut I can hurt your feelings.\n\n\n\nI can see clearly when I'm drunk,\n\nI have no expectations,\n\nI promised fear, but let you down,\n\nI have no obligations.\n\nWhen I see children to be ground,\n\nI have no expectations.\n\nWhen out in space you will miss sound."
