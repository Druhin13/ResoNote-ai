  "lyrics": "We should be drinkin' alone together\r\nDrownin' the pain is better\r\nWith somebody else who got problems\r\nWe ain't gonna solve 'em\r\nThe misery loves company\r\nTonight all I need is a stranger\n\nLips with a whiskey chaser\n\nAnd a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone\n\nOh, we should be drinkin' alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nWe should be drinkin' alone together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\n\n\nI don't know what she did to make you hurt like this\n\nBut, I know just what to do\n\nIt starts with a bottle of good [?]\n\nAnd ends with a shooter or two\n\nTomorrow when the sun comes up\n\nTonight's the night that never was\n\nMaybe just forget my name\n\nWon't be your one and only\n\nBut just 'cause we're lonely don't mean that we should\n\n\n\nWe should be drinkin' alone together\n\n'Cause drownin' the pain is better\n\nWith somebody else who got problems\n\nWe ain't gonna solve 'em\n\nBut misery loves company"
