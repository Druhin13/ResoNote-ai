  "lyrics": "I'll let the water run\r\nLower myself into it\r\nDelivers me\r\nAnd I become clean\r\nI'd give it all to you\n\nTo become one with myself\n\nYour body\n\nMoves slowly\n\n\n\nOh I feel it deeper now\n\nAnd I think that it's better somehow\n\n\n\n(Give into it)\n\nI shut off all the lights\n\n(You've been waiting, you deserve it)\n\nAnd beneath the darkness\n\n(Come and take me)\n\nI hold my breath\n\nAnd just wait for it\n\n\n\nOh I feel it deeper now\n\nAnd I think that it's better somehow\n\nRed clutch farm kid not making a sound\n\nNow the waters all over the ground"
