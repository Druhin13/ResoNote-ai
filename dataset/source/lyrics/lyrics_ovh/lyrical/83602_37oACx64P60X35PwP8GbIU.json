  "lyrics": "Sweet addiction my only friend\r\nNeed to feel you on my lips again\r\nSlowly taste you, I'm breathing you in\r\nGuarding beyond my way\r\nGolden savior, ice cold kissed\n\nStuck me shaking, keep control of this\n\nUnforgiving, I'm living ashamed\n\nSteady my pulse again\n\nTaking me by the hand\n\n\n\nIsolated, dazed and confused\n\nI know I can always count on you\n\nNo one understands me quite like you do\n\nYou've seen the worst of me\n\nAnd you'll be the one who leads\n\nInto the dark\n\n\n\nEyes wide open but blind to the truth\n\nBattling numbers with knowledge and proof\n\nNo ignition, no [?]\n\nBlack out the memories\n\n\n\nIsolated, dazed and confused\n\nI know I can always count on you\n\nNo one understands me quite like you do\n\nYou've seen the worst from me\n\nAnd you'll be the one who leads\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\n\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\n\n\nNo reflection, no memory\n\nEverything I had was taken from me\n\nI'm slowly fading, I'm drifting away\n\nLetting the shadows prevail\n\n\n\nDistant lover, my trusted friend\n\nFollow me until the bitter end\n\nYou consume me, prepare me for death\n\nThis is my final day\n\nGarden beyond my way\n\n\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark\n\nInto the dark"
