  "lyrics": "I heard that there are seasons\r\nTo laugh and to cry\r\nI struggle with the season\r\nWhen You lived and You died\r\nIt's hard to play this game\r\nBecause the rules, they don't seem fair\n\nIf You care, God if You're still there\n\n\n\nBombs falling in Syria\n\nA child dying of AIDS\n\nFighting 'round the world\n\nA daddy lost his girl\n\nStill we kneeled and prayed\n\nBut Heaven can feel silent\n\nAnd the floor beneath gets cold\n\nWhen your soul refuses to let go\n\n\n\nBut wait, tell me am I too late?\n\n\n\nWhat happens when the healing never comes?\n\nDo we stand and curse the heavens\n\nOr lift our hands and feel the sun\n\nThe mystery's not clear\n\nJust once, Your voice I'd love to hear\n\nWhat happens when the healing never comes?\n\n\n\nI know we love the seasons\n\nLike summer and the spring\n\nBut I've been stuck in winter\n\nSince the fall of misery\n\nOne day I'm full of anger\n\nAnd the next I'm full of fear\n\nEvery year, there's a new supply of tears\n\n\n\nBut wait, tell me am I too late?\n\n\n\nIs there a chance for me to believe\n\nWe would dance together soon\n\nIf there's a billion galaxies\n\nI'll count each one 'til I'm with You\n\nThey say where You are is better\n\nBut I want You here with me\n\nOh, this is for a purpose\n\nBut hurt won't let me see\n\n\n\nSo now I must be silent\n\nYour voice is in the wind\n\nThe hands that made the heavens\n\nWill heal the storm within\n\nI have so many questions\n\nI don't know where to begin\n\nSince You were there at the beginning\n\nYou already know the end\n\n\n\nOoh, what happens when the healing never comes\n\nDo we stand and curse the heavens\n\nOr lift our hands and feel the sun\n\nThe mystery's not clear\n\nJust once, Your voice I'd love to hear\n\nWhat happens when the healing\n\nWhat happens when the healing\n\nWhat happens when the healing never comes"
