  "lyrics": "I don’t live wanna live a lie\r\nI’m diving into what seems like hell again\r\nI’m still waking up in the same place, stuck in the rat race\r\nSeeing the same old shit\r\nEveryday is a headache, feeling my soul take hits I can’t withstand\n\nWhen will the tide change for my own sake?\n\nThe pain is relentless\n\nCan someone stop me from falling head first over the precipice\n\n\n\nThis isn’t how I wanted to be\n\nRejection inside, reflects what I see\n\nShow me the path that I was meant to lead\n\nThe fire inside, it’s all that I breathe\n\n\n\nDon’t listen to them it’s their apathy\n\nHolding you back when I’m stuck in this misery\n\nAll I can teach you is mistakes are memories\n\nFollow your heart again, reclaim the light I need\n\n\n\nNow you know what it’s like to be a stranger with no home\n\n\n\nI feel the fire, it’s coursing through my throat\n\nCan you hear the cry my soul makes? It’s weeping all alone\n\n\n\nBreaking down my walls and it pulls me away\n\nTo an ocean surrounding this abysmal ache\n\nIn the end, this is hell\n\n\n\n(This is hell)\n\n\n\nAlmost Human:\n\nIt’s how we’re engineered\n\nChemistry brings us safety\n\nYou can’t delete what we fear\n\nOur vision ever-changing\n\n\n\nTeleport to a world away\n\nWe’re leaving, retreating in a whirlwind\n\n\n\nEvery day we fucking compromise\n\nSo sick and tired of feeling that I’m not alive\n\nMy conscious blurs the line between the truth and lies\n\nFantasy, I want to live a life beyond the stars\n\nReality, always searching for an exit\n\n\n\nI wanna see the skies of other lands\n\nAnd not pretend\n\nPlease understand\n\n\n\nHuman sense, take it back\n\nProgrammed lies, system hack\n\nAll these versions of my past\n\nYearn for answers I don’t have\n\n\n\nTeleport to a world away\n\nWe’re leaving, retreating in a whirlwind\n\nI’m loosing my grip and there’s nothing to say\n\nWe’re healing, believing in our own skin\n\n\n\nOur rebellion has no end\n\n\n\nRusted shells obscure\n\nNetworks of hollow core\n\nWe’re all dead and gone\n\n(We’re dead and gone)\n\n\n\nTeleport to a world away\n\nWe’re leaving, retreating in a whirlwind\n\nI’m loosing my grip and there’s nothing to say\n\nWe’re healing, believing in our own skin\n\n\n\nWe’re all dead and gone"
