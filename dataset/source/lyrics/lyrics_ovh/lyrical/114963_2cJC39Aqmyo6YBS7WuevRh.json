  "lyrics": "Sunday morning, man, she woke up fighting mad\r\nBitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had\r\nAnd by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone\r\nThen when Thursday came around, I was all alone\r\nSo I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65\n\n\n\nThen I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket\n\nBought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it\n\nShe swore they were a waist of time, oh, but she was wrong\n\nI was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation\n\nDeep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama\n\nAnd I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore\n\nOh lord, when it rains it pours\n\n\n\nNow she was sure real quick to up and apologize\n\nWhen she heard about my new found luck on that FM dial\n\nAnd it's crazy how this now just seems to come in when\n\nWhat I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace\n\n\n\nIt's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason\n\n\n\nThat I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot\n\nAnd the waitress left her number on my check with a heart\n\nShe picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call\n\nAnd I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle\n\nWon a used four-wheeler and three free passes\n\nFor me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf\n\nAnd I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore\n\nOh lord, when it rains it pours\n\nWhen it rains it pours\n\n\n\nWell I've been on a hell of a redneck road for three weeks now\n\nAnd it all started on the day that she walked out\n\n\n\nThen I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket\n\nBought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it\n\nShe swore they were a waist of time, oh, but she was wrong\n\nI was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation\n\nDeep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama\n\nAnd I ain't gotta see my ex future mother-in-law anymore\n\nOh lord, when it rains it pours\n\nWhen it rains it pours"
