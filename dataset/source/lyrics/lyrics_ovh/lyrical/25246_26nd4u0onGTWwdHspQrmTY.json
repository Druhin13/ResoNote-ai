Salami\r\nI scrolled down and hit a link\nThat Westminster had been closed\nFive people dead, a madman’s head\nLay there leaking on the road\nHe’d used a car to plow a crowd\nStabbed a cop when he imposed\nAll sense was out the picture\nSo Isis struck a pose\n\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\n\nI heard that an ancient book\nInspired him to die\nThe Jihad source decoded wrong\n\nEnforces that old line\nBut when words contort in certain tones\nIs it the preacher, scribe or\nOne guy that does the crime\n\nThe news lost focus of the man\nAnd took the Isis bait\nAin’t the definition of terrorism\nTo gain aims through fear and hate\nBut fearless people are hard to buy\nIf what you sell’s to keep them safe\nAnd “I’ll kick out all the terrorists” sounds great\nIn a political debate\n\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\n\nThe Isis crisis\n\nLogic states\nThat if you bomb my home\nI might not be alone\nWhen I remember\nAnd I might need Jihad\nTo fill the hole\n\nI heard that the Middle East\nIs where the terrorists are bred\nBut that’s where most the oil is\nWe need to make our bread\nAnd if you need to convince a Middle Eastern\nDictator to leave his home\nYou can hire Isis to do some terror you condone\n\nThe Isis crisis\n\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\n\nDictators fall when they cease to exchange\nMoney in our name\nAnd bombs are just a symptom of\nThe way we play the game\nA group of brain washed holy men\nFill only a fraction of the frame\nVivid street level expendables\nPawns born off this play\n\nAnd any day now\nWe might just find a way\nA way\nTo turn it off\nTo turn off….\n\n\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis\nThe Isis crisis"
