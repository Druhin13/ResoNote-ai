  "lyrics": "I'm high strung, universal donor\r\nThat's Type A, Type O\r\nTo wake up, calm down, or shape up:\r\nChai tea\r\nTai chi\r\nTae bo\n\nNo easy money\n\nI'm tryna get rich slow\n\nStanding on the acorn I planted\n\nI trust that oak trees grow\n\nENFP Myers Briggs\n\n6'2\" in my highest kicks\n\nHero to the neighbor's kid\n\nDolled up I'm the baddest person\n\nStill like backpacks over purses\n\nHate that Qs are 2s in cursive\n\nTalk real fast when I get nervous\n\nRap real fast, but that's on purpose\n\nI've single-handed some duets\n\nI've been as bad as good girls get\n\nBut I don't regret too much just yet\n\nI mostly gave more than I got\n\nTried not to watch the ticking clock\n\nLike, always a bridesmaid\n\nNever an ASTRONAUT!"
