  "lyrics": "Standin' on a bridge, see the water keep flowin' by, by\r\nI flipped a quarter in the river, then I headed for the other side, side\r\nI made the same wish that I always do\r\nI'm just fool enough to think they ever come true\r\nCame in like a lion, now I'm out like a lamb\r\nThey don't even know who I am\n\n\n\nMiles and miles wide open for me\n\nGot it all laid out so beautifully\n\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all\n\n\n\nOld ghost whistle in the wind in the dead of night, night\n\nI'm walkin' through the valley of the shadow headin' for the light, light\n\nI wore out my welcome like I always do\n\nGot to find myself a life that's shiny new\n\nThey say that the truth is gonna set us free\n\nI ain't waitin' 'round to see\n\n\n\nMiles and miles wide open for me\n\nGot it all laid out so beautifully\n\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all\n\nSqueezin' every drop outta what's left of my time\n\nJumpin' on tormorrow before it goes by\n\nNo matter what they say, babe, we can run away from it all\n\n\n\nMiles and miles wide open for me\n\nGot it all laid out so beautifully\n\nDon't you worry 'bout a thing, baby, we can run away from it all\n\nSqueezin' every drop outta what's left of my time\n\nJumpin' on tormorrow before it goes by\n\nNo matter what they say, babe, we can run away from it all"
