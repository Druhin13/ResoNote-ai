You oughta know what you're gonna get in me--\n\nJust a little touch of star quality\n\nFill me up: with your heat, with your noise, with your dirt; overdo me!\n\nLet me dance to your beat, make it loud, let it hurt; run it through me!\n\nDon't hold back -- you are certain to impress\n\nTell the driver this is where I'm staying\n\n\n\nHello, Buenos Aires!\n\nGet this! Just look at me: dressed up, somewhere to go--\n\nWe'll put on a show!\n\n\n\nTake me in at your flood, give me speed, give me lights; set me humming!\n\nShoot me up with your blood, wine me up with your nights; watch me coming!\n\nAll I want is a whole lot of excess\n\nTell the singer this is where I'm playing\n\n\n\nStand back, Buenos Aires!\n\nBecause you oughta know what you're gonna get in me:\n\nJust a little touch of star quality\n\n\n\nAnd if ever I go too far\n\nIt's because of the things you are\n\nBeautiful town, I love you\n\n\n\nAnd if I need a moment's rest\n\nGive your lover the very best\n\nReal eiderdown and silence\n\n\n\nYou're a tramp, you're a treat, you will shine to the death; you are shoddy!\n\nBut you're flesh, you are meat, you shall have every breath in my body!\n\nPut me down for a lifetime of success\n\nGive me credit; I'll find ways of paying\n\n\n\nRio de la Plata!\n\nFlorida! Corrientes! 9 de Julio!\n\nAll I want to know\n\n\n\nStand back, Buenos Aires!\n\nBecause you oughta know what you're gonna get in me:\n\nJust a little touch of\n\nJust a little touch of\n\nJust a little touch of star quality!"
