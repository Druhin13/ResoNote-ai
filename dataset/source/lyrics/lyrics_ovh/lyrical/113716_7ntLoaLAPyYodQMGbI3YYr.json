  "lyrics": "How is it I never see\r\nThe waves that bring her words to me\r\nFor though unseen they drift around\r\nThey catch my breath and knock me down\r\nI feel them quickly swirling by\n\nAs they withdraw with my reply\n\nAnd slip into the dark of night\n\nAs I attempt to stay upright\n\n\n\nInstead I'm stranded on my knees\n\nAs words depart upon the breeze\n\nThat quickly drifts away from here\n\nAnd possibly won't reach her ear\n\n\n\nIf we could see these many waves\n\nThat flow through clouds and sunken caves\n\nShe'd sense at least the words that sought her\n\nOn the wind and underwater"
