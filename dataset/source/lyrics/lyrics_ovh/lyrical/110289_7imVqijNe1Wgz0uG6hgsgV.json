I could put my heart on a plate\n\nHa, I need help Lord\n\n'Cause this whole time knowin' that I'm comin' up\n\nI've been doin' all of this by myself Lord\n\nAnd the only thing I ever did was fuck it up (Fuck it up)\n\n\n\nLoose screw, tight circle\n\nEradicate, dead weight\n\nMy move, your move\n\nMy move, checkmate\n\nWon't lose, too soon\n\nTo die, I'm too great\n\nNext move my best move\n\nYou lose, checkmate\n\nLoose screw, tight circle\n\nEradicate, dead weight\n\nMy move, your move\n\nMy move, checkmate\n\nWon't lose, too soon\n\nTo die, I'm too great\n\nNext move my best move\n\nYou lose, checkmate\n\n\n\nTake flight before the crash and burn\n\nLeft in a hurry for a fast return\n\nCalm with the reaper but the bastard dies\n\nDevil twist the truth but the pastor lies\n\nBaptized in that fire water\n\nI'ma die harder than Bruce Willis\n\nToo witted I'm a loose cannon\n\nKeep your nose out, you got no business\n\nSo see us I'm sick of you\n\nPoint and aim, I don't pick and chose\n\nPillow talk is what bitches do\n\nBut I'm brain dead, you better think it through\n\nYou can't hide from your past\n\nHe show his face like peek-a-boo\n\nYou don't have no respect, them young gun's gon' teach it to\n\nMy next move will be my best move\n\nMy last move, total lie\n\nBuild my kingdom like Camelot\n\nGo to war for love, Sir Lancelot\n\nThey dance around, I mosh pit\n\nI speak the truth and they talk shit\n\nTimes short, hear the clock tick\n\nNo more locked doors, I'm the lock smith\n\n\n\nLoose screw, tight circle\n\nEradicate, dead weight\n\nMy move, your move\n\nMy move, checkmate\n\nWon't lose, too soon\n\nTo die, I'm too great\n\nNext move my best move\n\nYou lose, checkmate\n\nLoose screw, tight circle\n\nEradicate, dead weight\n\nMy move, your move\n\nMy move, checkmate\n\nWon't lose, too soon\n\nTo die, I'm too great\n\nNext move my best move\n\nYou lose, checkmate"
