  "lyrics": "You always sleep with your clothes at the foot of the bed\r\nWaiting for someone to wake you back up then you're gone again\r\nAlways knew you were a runner but I never thought you'd run\r\nRun right back out to the street to yell\r\nI don't know why I'm so angry but I'll try not to be\n\nCatching a cab in the cold with you thinking I musta' gotten lazy\n\nMe and this whole God damn city\n\nAin't that the way it always goes?\n\nYou hate what you love when it loves you the most\n\n\n\nYou always told me that someday you'd tear me apart\n\nI didn't think I believed you, well I guess that I did\n\nAlways knew you were a winner but I never thought you'd win\n\nDidn't even know we were playing\n\n\n\nSo run right back out to the street to yell\n\nI don't know why I'm so angry but I'll try not to be\n\nCatching a cab in the cold with you thinking I musta gotten lazy\n\nMe and this whole God damn city\n\nAin't that the way it always goes?\n\nYou hate what you love when it loves you the most\n\nAin't that the way it always goes?\n\nYou hate what you love if it loved you first"
