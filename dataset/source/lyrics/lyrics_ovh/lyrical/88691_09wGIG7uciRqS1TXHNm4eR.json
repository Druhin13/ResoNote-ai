  "lyrics": "I, don't, like how I'm feeling\r\nSwaying in the branches and the ground feels like the ceiling\r\nAnd I'm steady going down\r\nLike I knew I would\r\nI'm steady going down\r\nLike I knew I would\n\nI'm sick of writing sad songs don't hold it against me\n\nBut god I'm so empty\n\nOh god I'm so empty\n\nI don't know if I'll recover from it\n\nDon't ever tempt me\n\nDon't ever tempt me\n\n\n\nGive me one reason why I shouldn't run away from here\n\nIf I set it all straight I can look you in your eyes\n\nAnd finally, make you proud\n\nGive me one reason why I shouldn't run away from here\n\nIf I set it all straight promise me you'll run away\n\nAs far as you can go\n\n\n\nI, don't, like what I'm saying\n\nWrite it all down then record it and replay it\n\nIt's the only thing that helps me feel at peace again\n\nThe only thing that helps me feel at ease again\n\nBut it doesn't last long it's only a deterrent\n\nTo keep me from hurtin', to keep me from hurtin'\n\nI don't know if I'll recover from it nothing is working\n\nNothing is working\n\n\n\nGive me one reason why I shouldn't run away from here\n\nIf I set it all straight I can look you in your eyes\n\nAnd finally, make you proud\n\nGive me one reason why I shouldn't run away from here\n\nIf I set it all straight promise me you'll run away\n\nAs far as you can go\n\n\n\nI've got things on my mind I wouldn't tell a soul\n\nIf you can hear me now just know you're not alone"
