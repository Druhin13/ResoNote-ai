  "lyrics": "It was the third of June,\r\nOn that summer's day\r\nWhen I became a man\r\nAt the hands of a girl almost twice my age\r\nAnd she came to me\n\nJust like a morning sun\n\nAnd it wasn't so much her words as such\n\nAs the way they were sung\n\nIt was the way they were sung\n\n\n\nDesiree\n\nOh, Desiree\n\nThere I was found\n\nBy the sweet passion sound\n\nOf your loving song\n\nTime was right, the night was long\n\n\n\nRemember, Desiree\n\nOh, Desiree\n\nSomehow I knew\n\nI could only have you 'til the morning light\n\nIf only for that single night\n\nSweet Desiree, you made it right\n\n\n\nThen came the fourth of June,\n\nOn that sleepless night\n\nWell I tossed and I turned\n\nWhile the thought of her burned\n\nUp and down my mind\n\n\n\nFor she was there and gone\n\nWithout one regret\n\nBut she continues on\n\nLike the words of a song\n\nI could not forget, I could not forget\n\n\n\nDesiree\n\nOh, Desiree\n\nThere I was found\n\nBy the sweet passion sound\n\nOf your loving song\n\nTime was right, the night was long\n\n\n\nRemember Desiree\n\nOh, Desiree\n\nAnd though somehow I knew\n\nI could only have you 'til the morning light\n\nThe night was long, the time was right\n\n\n\nDo you remember, Desiree\n\nOh, Desiree\n\n\n\nDo you remember,\n\nDesiree"
