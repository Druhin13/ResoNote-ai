Don't mess with me\n\nOne phone call, three casualties\n\nI spend 20 racks casually\n\nThere's nobody I'd rather be\n\nI don't wanna hear compares 'bout me\n\nThere's a couple girls I'd rather see\n\nBetter cut me off while you count on me\n\n\n\nPlease don't cut me off, know you got the sauce\n\nYou've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off\n\nPlease don't cut me off, know I did you wrong\n\nYou've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off"
