  "lyrics": "I know it's hard to admit it that you found love\r\nIt's hard to stay in it, but it's better\r\nThan anyone I've seen you with before\r\nSo talk to me, tell me 'bout all your insecurities\r\nAnd I'll try to make you see what I see\r\nYou're happier than I've ever seen you\n\n\n\nIt's true love, don't fake it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\nIt's right here, don't waste it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\nDon't say you can't figure it out, figure it out\n\nI know you can figure it out, figure it out\n\nIt's true love, don't waste it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\n\n\nYou better not\n\n\n\nDon't overthink it\n\nLet it go and try adjust the feeling\n\nYou know that in your [?] you're healing\n\nFrom every time that you've been hurt before\n\nI see, I see it\n\n\n\nIt's true love, don't fake it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\nIt's right here, don't waste it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\nDon't say you can't figure it out, figure it out\n\nI know you can figure it out, figure it out\n\nIt's true love, don't waste it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\n\n\nYou better not\n\nYou better not\n\n\n\nI know you can figure it out, figure it out\n\nIt's true love, don't waste it\n\nDon't say you can't figure it out, figure it out\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\n\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\nIt's true love, don't fake it\n\nYou better not, you better not\n\nIt's right here, don't waste it\n\nYou better, you better not"
