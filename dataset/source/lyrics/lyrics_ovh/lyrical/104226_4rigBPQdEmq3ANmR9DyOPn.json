  "lyrics": "Dislocated\r\nSelf is fading\r\nFalling back from what I was\r\nFlying through existence\r\nTumbling towards a burning sun\r\nSomething screaming in the distance\n\nTelling me to come\n\nIt's calling me\n\n\n\n\"Are you out there waiting?\"\n\nI can hear it calling\n\nIt takes more than eyes to see\n\nIt's out in the energy but\n\nI can hear it calling\n\n\n\nTake the path less traveled\n\nFace the darkness on my own\n\nInto the starlight will I go\n\nUntil the end I will roam\n\nFate itself unraveled\n\nMake the emptiness my home\n\nInto the starlight will I go\n\nSoaring into the unknown\n\n\n\nSuffocated\n\nVoice has faded\n\nIs this real or in my mind?"
