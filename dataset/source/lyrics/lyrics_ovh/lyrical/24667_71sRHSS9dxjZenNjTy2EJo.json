You know they have fallen on\n\nCampfires cold and dark that never see a spark burn bright\n\n\n\nRoll along, roll on\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\nDusty days are gone\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\n\n\nTrails that brought them home echo names they've known\n\nFour days high and lonely comin' to you only here\n\nYou're the one they'd turn to, the only one they knew who'd do\n\nAll her best to be around when the chips were down\n\n\n\nRoll along, roll on\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\nDusty days are gone\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\n\n\nShadows touch the sand and look to see who's standin'\n\nWaitin' at your window, watchin' will they ever show?\n\n\n\nRoll along, roll on\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\nDusty days are gone\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\n\n\nRoll along, roll on\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\nDusty days are gone\n\nRose of Cimarron\n\n\n\nHearts like yours belong\n\nFollowing the dawn\n\nWrapped up in a song\n\nRose of Cimarron"
