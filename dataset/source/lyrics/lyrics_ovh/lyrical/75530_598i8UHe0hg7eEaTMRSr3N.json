  "lyrics": "All alone in the dead of night\r\nMy worst nightmare is coming true\r\nSoon they'll come for me with one single kiss\r\nI stand accused - you put me down\r\nBut I forgive this thorny crown\r\nI gave you hope\n\nWhat do you want from me\n\n\n\nMy heart - my soul, I gave it to you\n\nTo lose control, so I'd lose it too\n\nThese sacred words, the ones that hold true\n\nMy heart - my soul, this one's for you\n\n\n\nI was lost in the wilderness\n\nWhere temptation was all I knew\n\nI was naked and cold, sufocated by hold\n\nI rose from the dust, I broke free from the chains\n\nThat was weakening me, my demons have lost\n\nI escaped from the cross\n\nThat was sucking the life out of me\n\n\n\nMy heart - my soul, I gave it to you\n\nTo lose control, so I'd lose it too\n\nThese sacred words, the ones that hold true\n\nMy heart - my soul, this one's for you\n\n\n\nI believe in this life that we live\n\nHatred and greed still divides all our creeds\n\n\n\nI pledge\n\nMy heart - my soul\n\nMy heart - my soul\n\n\n\nAll alone in the dead of night\n\nMy worst nightmare will come to you\n\nYou'll be naked and cold caught in my stranglehold\n\nI rise from the dust straight up into the light\n\nWhere I see everything and make everything right\n\nIt's my will and my hope\n\nBut will you still believe in me\n\n\n\nMy heart - my soul, I gave it to you\n\nTo lose control, so I'd lose it too\n\nThese sacred words, the ones that hold true\n\nMy heart - my soul, this one's for you\n\n\n\nPledge\n\nMy heart and soul\n\nPledge\n\nMy heart and soul\n\nPledge\n\nMy heart and soul\n\nPledge\n\nMy heart, my heart and soul"
