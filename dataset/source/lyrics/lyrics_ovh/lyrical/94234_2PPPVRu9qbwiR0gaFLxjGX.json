  "lyrics": "I know it's a drag, I know it's a grind\r\nI know that a dollar ain't worth a dime\r\nJust trying to keep up with the Joneses\r\nAt the end of the block\r\nI know you get tired, I know you get down\r\nI know you get sick of this soul sucking town\n\nLet's make a little lemonade if lemons is all we got\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me\n\nI never gotta wonder where my honey be\n\nI ain't saving all my sugar for a Saturday night\n\nSeven days a week I got an appetite\n\nSunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen\n\nDon't waste another mile or a minute not kissing me\n\nLife is short, make it sweet\n\n\n\nOpen sky, glimpse of heaven, take the top off the CJ-7\n\nLet that surfside San Anne wind mess up your hair\n\nAnd let that windshield frame the ocean\n\nRadio keep coast-to-coasting\n\nIf we don't get where we're going baby I don't care\n\nI'm already there\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me\n\nI never gotta wonder where my honey be\n\nI ain't saving all my sugar for a Saturday night\n\nSeven days a week I got an appetite\n\nSunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen\n\nDon't waste another mile or a minute not kissing me\n\nLife is short, make it sweet\n\n\n\nDays will be long but the years will fly right by\n\nWe'll never be as young as we are tonight\n\nBaby ain't that right, yeah\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm stuck on you, you're stuck on me\n\nI never gotta wonder where my honey be\n\nI ain't saving all my sugar for a Saturday night\n\nSeven days a week I got an appetite\n\nSunsets like a tangerine, let's find a road we've never seen\n\nDon't waste another mile or a minute not kissing me\n\nLife is short, make it sweet\n\nLife is short, make it sweet\n\nOh yeah"
