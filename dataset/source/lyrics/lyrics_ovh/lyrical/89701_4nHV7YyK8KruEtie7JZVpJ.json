  "lyrics": "I remember as a child\r\nI was absolutely wild\r\n'Bout some red shoes that my aunt Lucy wore\r\nShe would let me stomp around\r\nIn those high heels up and down\r\nRound the house and round the wrap around porch\n\n\n\nAnd from that moment on\n\nI've had a pair of my own\n\nThey make me feel at home and brand new\n\nThey build my confidence\n\nAs if they've been heaven sent\n\nI feel alone, I'm puttin' on my red shoes\n\n\n\nI begged mama, \"Pretty please,\n\nFrom the wishbook order me,\n\nA pair of red shoes for my feet\", so mama did\n\nThrough the years I've thought about\n\nAunt Lucy's love and think of how\n\nSuch little things in life can make or break a kid\n\n\n\nI believe that every child\n\nNeeds to feel a sense of pride\n\nAnd someone to love and guide and see them through\n\nSo many miles I've traveled\n\nMany times they've come unraveled\n\nOn the road both smooth or gravel\n\nBut I've made it through, ooh\n\n\n\nHell and half of Georgia\n\nOr walkin' through New Orleans\n\nWalked the streets of Memphis bowlin'\n\nStroll around a block or two\n\nAnd if God sees fit to hold me\n\nAnyone that's ever known me\n\nKnow I'd walk the ghost streets only\n\nIn a pair of red shoes\n\n\n\nAnd if I ever get to heaven\n\nIf I ever get to heaven\n\nIf I ever get to heaven\n\nAnd Lord I hope I do\n\nI will walk the streets of glory\n\nI will walk the streets of glory\n\nI will tell my Lucy story\n\nAnd walk with her in red shoes"
