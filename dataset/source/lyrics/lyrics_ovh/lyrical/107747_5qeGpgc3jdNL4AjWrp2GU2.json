I'll introduce you to him\n\nSet me on a blind date once, I hit Medusa for 'em\n\nWise man can see that a peasant has a king in 'em\n\nDance wit' the devil but never for you to sing wit' 'em\n\nRun wit' a demon but never for you to cling to 'em\n\nSee the angle, all of the angels ain't got wings to 'em\n\nMe? I go black when they challenge my G\n\nI blow my soul out the challenge tryna balance my chi\n\nChannel my rage or it's Animal P\n\nYeah, he plant-based but he could lead this room on a cannibal steez\n\nYou ain't fuckin' with the Phantom, you see\n\nIf you don't, 'cause I knocked your eyes out for your family to see, yeah!\n\n\n\n[?]\n\n\n\nWack rappers shouldn't be breathin', at least not a rhyme\n\nFuck about your set, my nigga, throw up a dollar sign\n\nFive niggas, ten guns, right up in the Impala ride\n\nPlayin' Spotify, tryna spot a guy, then a shot'll fly\n\nAll twenty in them shits, yeah, it's homicide\n\nYou can get the picture, bitch, I ain't got to dramatize\n\nI ain't take drama class, askin' where the [?] at\n\nHash in it, askin' shit like, \"where his baby momma at?\"\n\nMy hood, it get terrible\n\nAnd the wrong territory leads to a burial\n\nFucked up scenario\n\nBack on that shit, loadin' up, yeah, here we go\n\nComin' through the strip, niggas skip, like, there they go\n\nAir hose and everything we pack, we prepared to go war like it's overseas\n\nKill 'em if it's over cheese or principles\n\nYou tried to violate what I oversee\n\nStick 'em like a [?] with a hawk, watch 'em over-bleed\n\n\n\n[?]"
