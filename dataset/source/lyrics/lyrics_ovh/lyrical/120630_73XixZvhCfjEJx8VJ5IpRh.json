  "lyrics": "This is how im feeling\r\nThis is how im feeling\r\nThis is how im feeling\r\nThis is how I'm feeling\r\nThat Bou Lou gonna give me a billion\n\nInshallah run it back with the willing\n\nI'm gonna be off on an island chilling\n\nI came a long way from the dealing\n\nAnd I still run with the 5-6 villain\n\nWe live life like it ain't no ceilings\n\nNever been a liver to take a killing\n\nI feel like breakdancing\n\nCause I got every bitch in the place straight glancing\n\nWhile they next to their lover looking at me hate stancing\n\nBut I'm always with niggas like a fake clansman\n\nHow I'm feeling is people keep using identical syllables\n\nSwitch it up a little bit I'm feeling that off on this planet is the only one feelable\n\nTo the masses perhaps to the people I'm no mariah since the umbilical\n\nI'm just a rapper that happens to kill a rope\n\nWhen I be clapping to kill it all so\n\n\n\nAh\n\nDid it all on purpose\n\nStep into your building to make you nervous\n\nBetter cuff your bitch cause she lurking\n\nSpilling all these drinks I purchase\n\nHey something real strange\n\nWhen I look around I see real things\n\nIf you make it out your feelings"
