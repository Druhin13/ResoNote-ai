  "lyrics": "Well, I met you at the blood bank\r\nWe were looking at the bags\r\nWondering if any of the colors\r\nMatched any of the names we knew on the tags\r\nYou said \"See, look, that's yours\r\nStacked on top with your brother's\n\nSee how they resemble one another's\n\nEven in their plastic little covers?\"\n\n\n\nAnd I said I know it well\n\nThat secret that you know\n\nBut don't know how to tell\n\nIt fucks with your honor\n\nAnd it teases your head\n\nBut you know that it's good girl\n\nBecause it's running you with red\n\n\n\nThen the snow started falling\n\nWe were stuck out in your car\n\nYou were rubbing both of my hands\n\nChewing on a candy bar\n\nYou said, \"Ain't this just like the present\n\nTo be showing up like this?\"\n\nAs a moon waned to crescent\n\nWe started to kiss\n\n\n\nAnd I said I know it well\n\nThat secret that we know\n\nThat we don't know how to tell\n\nI'm in love with your honor\n\nI'm in love with your cheeks\n\nWhat's that noise up the stairs, babe?\n\nIs that Christmas morning creaks?\n\n\n\nAnd I know it well\n\nI know it well\n\nAnd I know it well\n\nI know it well\n\nAnd I know it well\n\nI know it well\n\nAnd I know it well\n\nI know it well"
