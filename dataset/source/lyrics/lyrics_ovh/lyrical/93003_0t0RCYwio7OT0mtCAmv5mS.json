  "lyrics": "Red and gold, that's my name\r\nAnd I'm there on the end of each and every day\r\nBlue skies or rain, clear, cloudy days\r\nI am there, come and find me\r\nAnd the hillside, she's my friend\n\nOn her shoulder is where I go to lay my head\n\nHigh above the sea, in her bussom, soft and green\n\nShe is there to lay beside me\n\n\n\nAnd my lady, cool blue water\n\nFor the way I love to lay myself upon her\n\nAnd everywhere you see, she is looking after me\n\nUntil I go, just like so many\n\n\n\nBut I'm here, red and gold\n\nIn the evenings, I am something to behold\n\nAnd in my waking hours, I lay among the flowers\n\nI am here, come and find me"
