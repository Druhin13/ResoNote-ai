'Cause I do\r\nI don't wanna be this cold\n\nShivering to my bones\n\nSomeone reset my soul, oh, oh\n\nAnd I don't wanna be locked up\n\nI don't wanna feel this down\n\nI just wanna scream and shout\n\n\n\nI’ll go and grow my hair too long\n\nSing your least favorurite song\n\nAt the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)\n\nI'll go out, kiss all of your friends\n\nMake a story and pretend\n\nIt was me that made this end (oh, oh, oh)\n\n\n\nLet me take a second to sympathise 'cause you're right\n\nI'm away too much, I think too much, I drink too much\n\nBut it's only a matter of time before we catch up\n\nAnd I get to say\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\n'Cause it's made me think and drink my way\n\nBack to mistakes I never should have made\n\nOnce more chance and I'll right the wrongs from yesterday\n\n\n\nI don't wanna feel this down\n\nI just wanna scream and shout\n\n\n\nI’ll go and grow my hair too long\n\nSing your least favorurite song\n\nAt the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)\n\nI'll go out, kiss all of your friends\n\nMake a story and pretend\n\nIt was me that made this end (oh, oh, oh)\n\nIt might seem cruel\n\nYou know that the love still hurts\n\nAll I do, never, ever seems to work\n\nI’ll go and grow my hair too long\n\nSing your least favorurite song\n\nAt the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)\n\n\n\nI been stumbling round\n\nAsking if you're in town\n\nI been drinking too much\n\nI don't give a fuck\n\n\n\nI’ll go and grow my hair too long\n\nSing your least favorurite song\n\nAt the top of my lungs\n\nI'll go out, kiss all of your friends\n\nMake a story and pretend\n\nIt was me that made this end (oh, oh, oh)\n\nIt might seem cruel\n\nYou know that the love still hurts\n\nAll I do, never, ever seems to work\n\nI’ll go and grow my hair too long\n\nSing your least favorurite song\n\nAt the top of my lungs (oh, oh, oh)\n\n\n\nI been stumbling round (round, round)\n\nAsking if you're in town (town, town)\n\nI been drinking too much (oh, I know I am)\n\nI don't give a fuck\n\nI been stumbling round (round, round)\n\nAsking if you're in town (town, town)\n\nI been drinking too much\n\nI don't give a fuck"
