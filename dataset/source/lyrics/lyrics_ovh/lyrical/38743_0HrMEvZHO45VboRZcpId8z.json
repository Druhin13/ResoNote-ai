  "lyrics": "Been walking these streets, been deciding what's true\r\nBeen hands in my pockets, coat collar up, thinking `bout you\r\nI've been talking to myself, giving fate the third degree\r\nI've been eyes on the pavement admitting my part to strangers passing me\r\nAnd I know it isn't fair, but nothing's ever been\r\nHey when you look at me baby, my god how I feel so good again\n\nI don't know where I went wrong, but it isn't right to lie\n\nHey when you look at me baby, my hearts wide open, naked to the eye\n\n\n\nNow some lovers are apart, but they're never far away\n\nI can see her in your eyes, hear her in your voice and I have to turn away\n\nOh what covet is to ache, is what aching is to me\n\nFor the arms of a man who knows who I am and where I need to be\n\nAnd if I know what I know, then the lonely can't pretend\n\nWhen you look at me baby, my god how I feel so whole again\n\nIs there heaven after all, or just this empty space\n\nThat no amount of time, nor comfort in it's hands can ever help me face\n\nWhich is worse is yet to come, your rebuff or my resign\n\nHey when you look at me baby, I'm helpless as a child, naked to the eye\n\n\n\nIt's like a fever and a spell, unbroken by a sigh\n\nOh when you look at me baby I'm going nowhere, just naked to the eye\n\nYeah when you look at me baby, everythings there, naked to the eye\n\nHey when you look at me baby, I haven't got a prayer, naked to the eye"
