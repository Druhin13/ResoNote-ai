  "lyrics": "It's quarter to three there's no one in the place except you and me\r\nSo set 'em up Joe I've got a little story you oughta know\r\nWe're drinking my friend to the end of a brief episode\r\nJust give me one for my baby and one more for the road\r\nI've got the routine so drop another nickel in the machine\n\nI'm feeling so bad I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad\n\nI could tell you a lot but you've got to be true to your code\n\nSo give me one for my baby and one more for the road\n\nJust give me one for my baby and one more for the road"
