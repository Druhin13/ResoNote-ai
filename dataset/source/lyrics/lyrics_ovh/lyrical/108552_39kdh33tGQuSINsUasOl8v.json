  "lyrics": "Thought I was drowning in my bed\r\nCouldn't get the moon out of my head\r\nSo I awoke before the break of day\r\nAnd walked along the coast of Galway\r\nSitting at the boardwalk bar, drinking a whiskey\n\nFeeling all the rage of a modern man\n\nWe used to feel our rage just like the sea\n\nNow we get it on an instalment plan\n\n\n\nAll my love\n\nTo you and yours\n\nAnd all the baby boys, they're dressing them in blue\n\nTeaching them that life's a roar\n\n\n\nI guess I'm a long way from where I was\n\nDrunk off my ass in some suburban town\n\nI betrayed my friend, nineteen and darwinian\n\nI'll never live that down\n\nBut I fell into a good girl's good graces\n\nAnd I poured my heart right into hers\n\nShe's more an optimist in muddy races\n\nThan a Venus in first\n\n\n\nAll my love\n\nTo you and yours\n\nAnd all the college boys, they're dressing up in suits\n\nThinking life's a roar\n\n\n\nSpring is coming\n\nLet me be like leeches\n\nRenew\n\nFootfall\n\n\n\nAll my love\n\nTo you and yours\n\nAnd all the baby boys, they're dressing them in blue\n\nTeaching them that life's a roar\n\n\n\nAll my love\n\nTo you and yours\n\nAnd all the college boys, they're dressing up in suits\n\nThinking life's a roar"
