  "lyrics": "I found myself dreaming in\nSilver and gold\nLike a scene from a movie\nThat every broken heart knows\n\nWe were walking on moonlight\n\nAnd you pulled me close\n\nSplit second and you disappeared\n\nAnd then I was all alone\n\n\n\nI woke up in tears\n\nWith you by my side\n\nA breath of relief\n\nAnd I realized\n\nNo, we're not promised tomorrow\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nAnd I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\n\nWherever we're standing\n\nI won't take you for granted\n\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\n\n\nIn the blink of an eye\n\nJust a whisper of smoke\n\nYou could lose everything\n\nThe truth is you never know\n\n\n\nSo I'll kiss you longer baby\n\nAny chance that I get\n\nAnd I'll make the most of the minutes\n\nAnd love with no regret\n\n\n\nSo let's take our time to say what we want\n\nUse what we got before it's all gone\n\nNo, we're not promised tomorrow\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nAnd I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\n\nWherever we're standing\n\nI won't take you for granted\n\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\n\n\nHey\n\nWhoa\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nAnd I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\n\nWherever we're standing\n\nI won't take you for granted\n\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nI'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\n\n\nLike I'm gonna\n\nlose you"
