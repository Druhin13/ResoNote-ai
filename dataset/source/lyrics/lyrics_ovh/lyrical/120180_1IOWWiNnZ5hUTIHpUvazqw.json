  "lyrics": "I just wanna talk to you\r\nLet's go back, go back to where real love used to be\r\nYou and me in the sand on the beach\r\nGold ropes, Rolexes and jet skis\r\nExit in Lexus, 470\r\nYou remember when\n\n\n\nThrough anything, our love will be good\n\nAnd sometimes you would be mad and I'd be sad for you\n\nHow the fuck can you deal with a nigga like me?\n\nDon't you know in the end I would make it up?\n\nAnd you can tell by the way we make love\n\nThis ain't just sex\n\nAlways like our first time, even in the worst time\n\n\n\nI break your love, but we always come back\n\nCome back and put it together again\n\nYou, ooh, break my love, ooh\n\nBut we always come back\n\nCome back and put it together again\n\n\n\nYou know how I miss you when you're gone\n\nWhen you're gone, alone, sittin' on that throne, ooh\n\nAnd no matter when ain't nobody home, alone, ooh\n\nSittin' there, chillin' out, waitin' like\n\nReally lookin' silly when there ain't nobody callin' on the phone\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nYou always pick the right fights, you pick the right fights\n\nBut only the make-up parts I like, only the make-up parts I like\n\n\n\nI break your love, but we always come back\n\nCome back and put it together again\n\nYou, ooh, break my love, ooh\n\nBut we always come back\n\nCome back and put it together again"
