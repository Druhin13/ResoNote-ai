You love her or nah?\n\nYou risk your whole home for a hoe from the bar?\n\nYou really want them hoes? You can have them bitches\n\nYou don't even cheat with no bad bitches\n\nThis shit is eating me, you sleeping peacefully\n\nGetting more mad at you, thinking 'bout stabbing you\n\nDon't even know that you this close to dying\n\nYou gon' wake up like, \"Why you got an attitude?\"\n\n\n\nMy heart is beating like it's bleeding out\n\n(You sleeping, you sleeping, you sleeping)\n\nYou sleeping like a baby\n\nEveryone was right about you now, and\n\n(You creeping, you creeping, you creeping)\n\n\n\nI went through your phone last night\n\nI went through your phone last night\n\nSaw some things I didn't like\n\nI went through your phone last night\n\nIt's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh\n\n\n\nIt's killing me\n\nIt's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh\n\nIt's killing me\n\nIt's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh\n\nIt's killing me\n\nIt's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh\n\nIt's killing me\n\n\n\nI went through your phone last night\n\nI went through your phone last night\n\nSaw some things I didn't like\n\nI went through your phone last night\n\nIt's killing me, killing me, killing me, oh"
