  "lyrics": "Oh Patricia, you've always been my North Star\r\nAnd I have to tell you something: I'm still afraid of the dark\r\nYou take my hand in your hand\r\nFrom you flowers grow\r\nAnd do you understand with every seed you sow you make this cold world...\r\nBeautiful?\n\n\n\nShe told me all doors are open to the believer\n\nI believe her, I believe her, I believe her\n\nShe told me all doors are open to the believer\n\nI believe her, I believe her, I believe her\n\n\n\nOh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh\n\nOh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh\n\n\n\nYou're a 'real man', and you do what you can\n\nYou only take as much as you can grab with two hands\n\nWith your big heart, you praise God above\n\nBut how's it working out for you, honey?\n\nDo you feel loved?\n\nDo you feel loved?\n\n\n\nOh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh\n\nOh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh\n\n\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\nI drink too much coffee and I think of you often\n\nIn a city where reality has long been forgotten\n\nAre you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified\n\nBut you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love\n\n\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\n\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\n\nIt's such a wonderful thing"
