  "lyrics": "The young gun\r\nI'm grieving for the young gun\r\nI'm thinking bout the young gun\r\nMy homey get life, he was only 16\r\nMy homey would pop pills, my homey would sip lean\n\nUsed to tell him all the time, my homey just get clean\n\nSaid \"I had to do it, Jelly, they were tryna kill me\"\n\nSo I feel the weight on my shoulder blades\n\nKnow that any day I could explode with rage\n\nThe one that know the least always got the most to say\n\nIf it's made us strong nobody get blown away\n\nStill I'm... country as cactus with coleslaw\n\nHad I seen him get hit over a phone call\n\nHad I seen him go switch and outta toes y'all\n\nHad I seen a man go snitch on all his road dogs\n\nDoing this awhile and I don't feel it anymore\n\nBut I kept my law away from when I'm kicking in them doors\n\nTold me build a legacy and I been building it for sure\n\nI've been dreaming that I'm walking on a million dollar floor\n\nWoke up on the dark side of the moon\n\nListen close, hear my soul singing out of tune\n\nAnd they say you're out of mind if you're outta fuel\n\nI feel like I'm out my mind and without a clue\n\nAnd I told my nephew, don't let em deceive you\n\nYou don't get another shot, you don't get a redo\n\nYou don't get another take, you don't get a sequel\n\nSo don't let it stress you, remember to keep cool\n\n\n\nI light night skies with taillights\n\nI hear those wolves call goodnight\n\nI feel those friends burn inside\n\nI wear no mask or disguise\n\n\n\nI'm a young gun\n\nThey ask where do we come from\n\nFrom a place where most people run from\n\nWhere the men of the family die so young\n\nSo the women gotta raise up the young ones\n\nGoodnight to the young guns\n\nMama take care of the young ones\n\nGrow up to be someone\n\nI grew up to be a young gun\n\n\n\nMama cried when my daddy passed away\n\nThen she stepped up to the plate to raise a man\n\nAnd I ain't understand at the time, I was only 10\n\nHad a feeling that my destiny had been planned\n\nI'll be damned if I end up like he did\n\nFaster with the banger than Billy the Kid\n\nNever had a father figure, only 2Pac and hard liquor\n\nAmbitions override, west side\n\nFace first in the streets, all eyes on me\n\nTryna fill a legacy\n\n45 and I have a key so demons never leave\n\nEven though mama prayed up, I still stayed up\n\nLate nights in a dark alley\n\nCall of the wild, screaming out, calling my name\n\nMy soul has been pulled up by chains, back in the reins\n\nApache blood runs through my veins\n\nCame from the flame so I cannot explain\n\nThe feeling I get from the pain\n\nComfort I get from the chaos, at home on these streets\n\nI can't stay off I'm lit like the candles in seance\n\nThey pray on my people and say that we're evil\n\nWe're dying by needles to fly with the eagles\n\nThey laws are illegal, immoral, deceitful\n\nI guess I'm supposed to be passive and peaceful\n\n\n\nI light night skies with taillights\n\nI hear those wolves call goodnight\n\nI feel those friends burn inside\n\nI wear no mask or disguise\n\n\n\nI'm a young gun\n\nThey ask where do we come from\n\nFrom a place where most people run from\n\nWhere the men of the family die so young\n\nSo the women gotta raise up the young ones\n\nGoodnight to the young guns\n\nMama take care of the young ones\n\nGrow up to be someone\n\nI grew up to be a young gun\n\n\n\nI light night skies with taillights\n\nI hear those wolves call goodnight\n\nI feel those friends burn inside\n\nI wear no mask or disguise\n\n\n\nI'm a young gun"
