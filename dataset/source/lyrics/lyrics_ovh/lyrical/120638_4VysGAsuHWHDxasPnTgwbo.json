  "lyrics": "Still got pictures of friends on the wall\r\nSuppose we aren't really friends anymore\r\nMaybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all\r\nGet freaked out from a knock at the door\r\nWhen I haven't been expecting one\r\nDidn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?\n\nWe'll be there at the back of the bar\n\nIn a booth like we usually were\n\nEvery time there was a rocket launch or some big event\n\n\n\nWhat a death I died writing that song\n\nFrom start to finish, with you looking on\n\nIt stays between us, Steinway and his sons\n\nBecause it's the ultracheese\n\nPerhaps it's time that you went for a walk\n\nDressed like a fictional character\n\nFrom a place they called America in the golden age\n\nTrust the politics to come along\n\nWhen you were just trying to orbit the sun\n\nWhen you were just about to be kind to someone because you have the chance\n\n\n\nI've still got pictures of friends on the wall\n\nI might look as if I'm deep in thought\n\nBut the truth is I'm probably not if I ever was\n\n\n\nOh the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne\n\nI've done some things that I shouldn't have done\n\nBut I haven't stopped loving you once"
