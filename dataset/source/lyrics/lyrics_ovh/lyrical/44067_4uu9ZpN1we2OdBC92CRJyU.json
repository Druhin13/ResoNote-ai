  "lyrics": "Deep within the corners of my mind\r\nI keep a memory of your faces\r\nAnd I only pull it out when I long for your embrace\r\nDeep within the corners of my mind\r\nI'm haunted by your smile\r\nAs it promises me joys like a journey to a tropic isle\n\nIt's not hard to see what you do to me\n\nIt's like a page right out of fist time wave\n\nThough I try to fight all the word you write\n\nLeave me standing in the starry robe in some tragic lovers place\n\nBut deep within the corners of my mind\n\nI'm praying secretly that eventually in time\n\nThere'll be a place for you and me\n\nThat eventually in time\n\nThere'll be a place for you and me\n\nThere'll be a place for you and me\n\nDeep within the corners of my mind\n\n\n\n\n\n(Grazie a Ale per questo testo)"
