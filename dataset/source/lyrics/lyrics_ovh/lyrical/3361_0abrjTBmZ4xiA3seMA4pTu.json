  "lyrics": "Pulling me, I can't breathe\r\nRescue me, darkness consuming\r\nTempting me, suffering\r\nBreak me free from the darkness inside me\r\nShadows take my hands as my mind begins to stray\n\nI'm lost in captive eyes, I can't seem to look away\n\nTesting my will, trying my faith\n\nI'm drenched in my sins, I am dripping with shame\n\nDefying my reasons, denying my heart\n\nI descend to hellfire, I am torn apart\n\n\n\nI need somebody to deliver me from hell\n\nI can't seem to find myself\n\nI could use some help\n\nDeliver me from hell\n\n\n\nThe serpent sends a smile and the apple is laced\n\nI tiptoe into the void, I long for the taste\n\nThe perversive pictures are fixed in my mind\n\nI'm worshipping fiction, the blind lead the blind\n\n\n\nI need somebody to deliver me from hell\n\nI can't seem to find myself\n\nI could use some help\n\nDeliver me from hell\n\n\n\nThe devil whispers to me\n\nI'll never be saved\n\nThe shovel pushes deeper and deeper\n\nI'm digging my own grave\n\nThe devil whispers to me\n\nI'll never be saved\n\nThe shovel pushes deeper and deeper\n\nI'm digging my own grave\n\nThe devil whispers to me\n\nI'll never be saved\n\nThe shovel pushes deeper\n\nI'm digging my own grave\n\nThe devil whispers to me\n\nI'll never be saved\n\nThe shovel pushes deeper\n\nI'm digging my own grave\n\n\n\nPulling me, I can't breathe\n\nPulling me, I can't breathe\n\nPulling me, I can't breathe\n\nPulling me, I can't breathe\n\nPulling me, I can't breathe\n\nPulling me, I can't breathe"
