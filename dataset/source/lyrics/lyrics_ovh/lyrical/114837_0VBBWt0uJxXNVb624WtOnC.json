  "lyrics": "I better slow down\r\n'Cause I keep keep trippin' on words I don't wanna say\r\nJust tell me right now\r\n'Cause I keep keep seein' the signs you want me to stay\r\nI can't commit, I can't make plans\n\nSometimes the bet ain't worth the hand\n\nI think you're special, it makes me sad\n\nDon't wanna wonder what we could've had\n\nAnd I hope you understand\n\nDon't get your feelings broken for nothin'\n\nMaybe I'm leavin'\n\nLeavin' here with nothin'\n\nI might regret that I can't be your man\n\nSometimes the bet isn't worth the hand\n\nAnd I can't keep lettin' this wave carry me away\n\nSo tell me right now\n\n'Cause I keep keep seein' the signs you want me to stay\n\n\n\nI got it bad\n\nI think you know\n\nYou're everything, you're beautiful\n\nBut my life is fast, can't make it slow\n\nWe're here right now\n\nKiss me before I go, but you got to let me go\n\nDon't get your feelings broken for nothin'\n\nMaybe I'm leavin'\n\nLeavin' here with nothin'\n\nI might regret that I can't be your man\n\nSometimes the bet isn't worth the hand\n\n(I been hurt before, don't wanna hurt no more)\n\nSometimes the bet isn't worth the hand\n\nI gotta let ya know girl\n\nI can't let it go any longer\n\nSometimes it ain't worth the hand"
