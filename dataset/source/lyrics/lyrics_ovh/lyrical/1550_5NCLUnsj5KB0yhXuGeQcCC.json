  "lyrics": "She had a dream\r\nAnd boy it was a good one\r\nSo she chased after her dream\r\nWith much desire\r\nBut when she got too close\r\nTo her expectations\n\nWell the dream burned up\n\nLike paper in fire\n\n\n\nPaper in fire\n\nStinkin' up the ashtrays\n\nPaper in fire\n\nSmokin' up the alleyways\n\nWho's to say the way\n\nA man should spend his days\n\nDo you let them smolder\n\nLike paper in fire\n\n\n\nHe wanted love\n\nWith no invovlement\n\nSo he chased the wind\n\nThat's all his silly life required\n\nAnd the days of vanity\n\nWent on forever\n\nAnd he saw his days burn up\n\nLike paper in fire\n\n\n\nPaper in fire\n\nStinkin' up the ashtrays\n\nPaper in fire\n\nSmokin' up the alleyways\n\nWho's to say the way\n\nA man should spend his days\n\nDo you let them smolder\n\nLike paper in fire\n\n\n\nThere is a good life\n\nRight across the green field\n\nAnd each generation\n\nStares at it from afar\n\nBut we keep no check\n\nOn our appetites\n\nSo the green fields turn to brown\n\nLike paper in fire\n\n\n\nPaper in fire\n\nStinkin' up the ashtrays\n\nPaper in fire\n\nSmokin' up the alleyways\n\nWho's to say the way\n\nA man should spend his days\n\nDo you let them smolder\n\nLike paper in fire"
