Yeah\n\n\n\nYou don't know what I'm thinking, you don't even try\n\nWhatever you've been drinking has got you out of your mind like\n\nI know you've been hurting, and I know I'm the reason why\n\n\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nOnly fools stick around when the love is gone\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nOnly fools stick around when the love is all gone\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nHey, I just fool around\n\nBabe, such a fool for me\n\n(Fool for me)\n\n'Cause only fools stick around\n\nWhen the love is all gone\n\n\n\nThere you go\n\nGetting so overly comfortable, baby\n\nDoes it ever cross your mind?\n\nLike oh no, she wants to be in somebody else's photos\n\nOn the low-low\n\nThere you go\n\nGetting so overly comfortable, baby\n\nDoes it ever cross your mind?\n\nLike oh no, she wants to be in somebody else's photos\n\nOn the low-low\n\n\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nOnly fools stick around\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nOnly fools stick around when the love is all gone\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nOnly fools stick around when the love is gone\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nOnly fools stick around when the love is all gone\n\nDon't you know, baby?\n\nHey, I just fool around\n\nBabe, such a fool for me\n\n(Fool for me)\n\n'Cause only fools stick around\n\nWhen the love is all gone\n\nDon't you know, baby?"
