  "lyrics": "Round for years, I'm an old disaster\r\nSo crawl in my arms and burn out faster\r\nKnown you for years as you've passed me by\r\nSo now I'm floating around and I'm sinking high\r\nSo now you've got your own match, can you make me a fire?\n\nSo I can burn in the ash like a Catholic liar\n\nNothing but tears as you pass me by\n\nFloating around and I'm sinking high\n\n\n\nI bet you know what I mean, different time\n\nSame old scene\n\nAnother cloudy day beneath a sunny sky\n\nNo wonder why I'm sinking high\n\n\n\nI bet you know what I mean, different time\n\nSame old scene\n\nAnother cloudy day beneath a sunny sky\n\nNo wonder why I'm sinking high\n\n\n\nIf my direction is true we can be there by midnight\n\nAnd we can do it again even if it don't feel right\n\nNow there's blood in my ears as you pass me by\n\nAnd I'll see you again when I'm sinking high\n\n\n\nI bet you know what I mean, different time\n\nSame old king\n\nAnother cloudy day beneath a sunny sky\n\nNo wonder why I'm sinking high\n\n\n\nSinking high\n\nSinking high\n\nSinking high\n\n\n\nI bet you know what I mean, different time\n\nSame old scene\n\nYou can lay me down till my head floats to the sky\n\nAnd no wonder why I'm sinking high"
