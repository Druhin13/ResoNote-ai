  "lyrics": "My one and only love\r\nI've been lonely long enough\r\nWill I find you when the night is over?\r\nTell me where did you go?\r\nI've been searching high and low\r\nI have only 'til the night is over\n\n\n\nIn every window, I pass\n\nYour reflection in the glass\n\nMakes me wonder if my mind is going\n\nShadows shifting in the rain\n\nSlowly driving me insane\n\nBy the stars above, I know we were in love\n\nI have only ’til the night is over\n\n\n\nI feel the weather change\n\nI hear the river say your name\n\nI watch the birds fly by\n\nI see an emerald in the sky\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the trail has gone cold\n\nI don’t know where else to go\n\nAnd my time, I fear, is nearly over\n\nWhen the ocean drinks the sky\n\nAnd the city winks its eye\n\nWhen the night is done, you’ll vanish in the sun\n\nWill I hold you when the night is over?\n\n\n\nAm I lost inside my mind?\n\nThere’s an emerald in the sky\n\n\n\nI hear the river say your name\n\nBy the stars above, I know we were in love\n\nI hear the river say your name\n\nI have only ’til the night is over"
