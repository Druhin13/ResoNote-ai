  "lyrics": "Well I try to close my eyes\r\nClear my mind\r\nJust listen to the wildflowers grow\r\nSuch whispers on the breeze\r\nIt don't come easy now\r\nOver all this noise\n\n\n\nSpent my youth among the pine\n\nThey used to sing a tune so fine\n\nAnd the wind moved like an echo\n\nCarryin' their voices\n\n\n\nAnd I saw it in a dream\n\nMonuments to trees\n\nAs the air we breathe turned our lungs to dust\n\nAnd the redwoods so tall\n\nAnd all their awe\n\nBegan to rust\n\n\n\nWith no bend and sway at all\n\nThat ancient dance is lost\n\nAnd the wind moved like an echo\n\nWith a sigh in every gust\n\n\n\nWell some day I hope to find\n\nThat land of honey wine\n\nWhere the coffee grows on the white oak trees\n\nAnd those sugar coated mountains\n\nIn the spring begin to melt into\n\nSweetest streams\n\n\n\nWhere each night the starlight and the sea\n\nTogether form eternity\n\nAnd the wind moves like an echo\n\nAs the world drops off to sleep"
