  "lyrics": "Six feet down, you left me in the ground for dead\r\nOnly shot three rounds, but one found a way to my head\r\nWell no one could survive with all of the blood that I bled\r\nBut I'm still alive, so I guess I'll try livin' instead\r\nYou took my life and wrecked it, but I've been resurrected\n\nOh, the Comeback Kid\n\n\n\nWhen you see my face you’ll think you're staring at a ghost\n\nWell you better be scared if you see that I'm getting close\n\n'Cause I'm comin' back around and there's justice to be served\n\nAnd baby what you get is exactly what you deserve\n\n\n\nYou took my life and wrecked it, but I've been resurrected\n\nOh, the Comeback Kid\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're all alone and you feel like the coast is clear\n\nWhen you think you got away and there's nothin' left to fear\n\nI bet you didn’t think that someone like me could find you\n\nWell turn around baby 'cause the ghost is right behind you\n\n\n\nYou took my life and wrecked it, but I've been resurrected\n\nOh, the Comeback Kid\n\n\n\nKeep comin' back, baby, keep comin' back, keep comin'\n\nComin' back, baby, keep comin' back, keep comin'\n\nComin' back, baby, keep comin' back, keep comin'\n\nComin' back, baby, keep comin' back, keep comin' back"
