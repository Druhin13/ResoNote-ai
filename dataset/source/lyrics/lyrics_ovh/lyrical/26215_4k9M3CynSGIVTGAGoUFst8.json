  "lyrics": "Echo chamber, let go danger\r\nSteatopygia, they had no idea\r\nI'm the nicest since Dionysius\r\nThe second well-paid, all of a sudden self-made\r\nRugged interdependence:\r\nLovers stand at the entrance, arms folded\n\nWould it be blasphemy to ask you to shake that ass for me? Ayurvedic medicine, the flyer way to better skin\n\nFive fingers divided can't even high five\n\nFive fingers together can keep them all alive\n\nBut Mr. Fisticuffs didn't get dissed enough\n\nWe gotta listen to criticism—a slap on the wrist isn't a bluff\n\nThere’s always room for humility\n\nI got inhuman skills for you still to see\n\nThere's perfect settings all around\n\nTightropes pulled together make for solid ground\n\nDouble up on math and gym to graduate sooner\n\nI wish someone had told me that before I was a Junior\n\n\n\nThey should call it L’apostrophe\n\nIt’s the capital of apple sauce and white wine\n\nI saw a light shine, it was a beacon from the Keystone Pipeline\n\nSo then I got lost or maybe dropped off\n\nIt’s all a haze in the days since it popped off\n\nMy soul waves from the graves of the Choctaw, they always call The old phase wanna run toward baseball\n\nThe new brains weren’t certain yesterday is gone 'cause the time that we were slaves isn’t way off\n\nI won’t play golf, I won’t pray to the sky and take days off\n\nI won't wait to decide\n\nI won’t sway to the side like my uncle that died of AIDS from putting needles in his veins raw\n\nI like to hang around people with the same flaws in a roller coaster made out of chainsaws\n\nBusta was right ‘cause everything remained raw\n\n\n\nHey ya, got you all in check like a small insect\n\nA veteran in rhetoric can pass a strange law\n\n“Declined to indict” reminds me I’m “white”\n\nEuphemism infuse a schism in truth and wisdom\n\n“Decline to indict,” a new euphemism taken to filthy heights\n\nCome Michael play in the milky night\n\nHow wrong can we say stuff and still be right?\n\nLike “organic evaporated cane juice”\n\nYour brain boost is my main use\n\nWith each heartbeat repeated and fart meat excreted\n\nI spark offense against the dark arts’ heat, neat!\n\nHindsight’s a divine right\n\nSo be untrue to yourself and think your forethought through\n\nAcknowledge we’re all brainwashed and you’re not you"
