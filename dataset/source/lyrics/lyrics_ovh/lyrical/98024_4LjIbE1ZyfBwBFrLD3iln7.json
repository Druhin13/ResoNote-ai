  "lyrics": "She's got a bumper like a billboard\r\nCovered in stickers of her favorita band\r\nShe's got a hangful of records that she turns to\r\nWhen she needs to land\r\nShe's a saturday night parade through the streets\r\nThat all eyes some to see including me\n\n\n\nShe carries memories around like souvenirs down in her pockets\n\nShe should have let some go by now but can't seem to drop it\n\nSays forgiveness ain't nothing but a lifeless tire on the shoulder of her soul\n\nThat never rolls\n\n\n\nChours:\n\nFor as much as she stumbled she's runnin'\n\nFor as much as she runs she's still here\n\nAlways hoping to find something quicker than heaven\n\nTo make the damage of her days disappear\n\nJust like Guinevere\n\nJust like Guinevere\n\n\n\nShe don't hold onto nothin' new for very long\n\nYeah she writes you in as just one more tale\n\nand then you're gone\n\n'Cause she once fell hard 'cause she dropped her guard\n\nAnd no one gets to stay it's just too late\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\n\n\nFor as much as she stumbled she's runnin'\n\nFor as much as she runs she's still here\n\n\n\nFor as much as she stumbled she's runnin'\n\nFor as much as she runs she's still here\n\nAlways hoping to find something quicker than heaven\n\nTo make the damage of her days disappear\n\nJust like Guinevere\n\nJust like Guinevere\n\n\n\nLean into me Guinevere\n\nBe mine tonight Guinevere"
