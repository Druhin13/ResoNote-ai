  "lyrics": "You could say I lived a crazy life for a man so young\r\nThe kind of made me question my faith\r\nNow I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone\r\nBut I guess that's just the price you pay\r\nI've already loved more than I thought I could love someone\n\nI've already felt my heart break\n\nI've already fell so many times but I got back up\n\nBut at least I did it all my way\n\n\n\nI've been through it all\n\nYeah, I've been through it all\n\nYeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes\n\nGod only knows I've been through it all\n\n\n\nGrowing up in this wild city you had to fight\n\nHow you know I'm not afraid\n\nMaybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble\n\nBut at least I did it all my way\n\n\n\nI've been through it all\n\nYeah, I've been through it all\n\nYeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes\n\nGod only knows I've been through it all\n\n\n\nYeah, I've been through it all\n\n\n\nI've been through it all\n\nYeah, I've been through it all\n\nYeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes\n\nGod only knows I've been through it all\n\nYou won't see me cry if tomorrow never comes\n\nGod only knows I've been through it all"
