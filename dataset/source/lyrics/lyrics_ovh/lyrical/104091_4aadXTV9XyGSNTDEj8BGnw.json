  "lyrics": "That girl's got her eyes on a fading horizon\r\nHere come the last line of our favorite song\r\nThe end of an era\r\nShe's gonna tear up\r\nThat interstate on her way to charleston\n\nShe's gone moving on\n\nTaking off my letter jacket\n\nShe gonna drive as far as she can tonight\n\nShe gonna sleep on the roadside\n\nShe'll know when our hometown country station\n\nTurns to static\n\nShe ain't ever been that far from home\n\nBut I know she's better off gone\n\n\n\nWe all knew that she was too good for kansas\n\nShe swears we'll end up together in the end\n\nBut she wouldn't have to say that\n\nIf she really thought that fact is\n\nShe ain't coming back again\n\n\n\nShe's gone moving on\n\nTaking off my letter jacket\n\nShe gonna drive as far as she can tonight\n\nShe gonna sleep on the roadside\n\nShe'll know when our hometown country station\n\nTurns to static\n\nShe ain't ever been that far from home\n\nBut I know she's better off gone\n\n\n\nOnly good thing I ever had\n\nJust up and gone away like that\n\nI love her enough to not hold on\n\nIt's gonna break my heart but I'll get along\n\n'Cause she's better off gone\n\n\n\nShe's gone moving on\n\nTaking off my letter jacket\n\nShe gonna drive as far as she can tonight\n\nShe gonna sleep on the roadside\n\nShe'll know when our hometown country station\n\nTurns to static\n\nShe ain't ever been that far from home\n\nBut I know she's better off gone\n\n\n\nYeah I know she's better off gone"
