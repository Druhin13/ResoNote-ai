(habibi)\n\nKeep me safe when I come home (habibi)\n\nLove me\n\nAh, love me like a–\n\n\n\nLove me like a desert rose\n\nHold me like you can't let go\n\nKeep me safe when I come home\n\nLove me like a–\n\n\n\nLike a desert\n\nHabibi, habibi (habibi)\n\nHabibi, habibi, ah (habibi)\n\nHabibi, habibi, ah\n\nLove me\n\nWon't you love me?"
