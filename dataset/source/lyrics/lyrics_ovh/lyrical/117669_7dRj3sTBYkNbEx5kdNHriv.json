  "lyrics": "Do you wanna start a cult with me?\r\nI'm not vibrating like I ought to be\r\nI need a purpose, I can't keep surfing\r\nThrough this existential misery\r\nNow we're gonna need some real estate\r\nBut if I choose my words carefully\n\nThink I could fool you that I'm the guru\n\nWait, how do you spell epiphany?\n\n\n\nBefore the truth will set you free, it will piss you off\n\nBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot\n\nToo late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one\n\n'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra\n\n\n\nCould I have your attention, please?\n\nIt's time to tap into your tragedy\n\nThink you could use a new abuser\n\nClose your eyes and listen carefully\n\nImagine you're stood on a beach\n\nWater gently lapping at your feet\n\nAnd now you're sinking, what were you thinking?\n\nThat's all the time we have this week\n\n\n\nBefore the truth will set you free, it will piss you off\n\nBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot\n\nToo late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one\n\n'Cause all you ever do is chant the same old mantra\n\n\n\nAnd I know this doesn't make a lot of sense\n\nBut do you really wanna think about yourself now?\n\nAll I'm asking for's a little bit of faith\n\nYou know it's easy to believe\n\nAnd I know this doesn't make a lot of sense\n\nYou know you gotta work the corners of your mind now\n\nAll I'm asking for's a little bit of faith\n\nYou know it's easy to, so easy to believe\n\n\n\nBefore the truth will set you free, it will piss you off\n\nBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot\n\nBefore the truth will set you free, it will piss you off\n\nBefore you find a place to be, you're gonna lose the plot\n\nToo late to tell you now, one ear and right out the other one\n\n'Cause all you ever do, is chant the same old mantra"
