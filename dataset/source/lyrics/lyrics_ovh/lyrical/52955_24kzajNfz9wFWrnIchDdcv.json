  "lyrics": "Gliding through the phantom landscape\nThe place forlorn of hope\nI saw her standing there, pallid in skin\nLifeless and ready to elope\nClosing in on her like a shadow sweeping\nI bowed and I took her by the hand\n\nUnder the starless sky\n\nAwake but sleeping\n\nGrievously seduced by the damned\n\nEnter your final hour\n\nFeel the cold, the demon's touch\n\nThe cosmic order now profoundly disturbed\n\nIn a moment's over shadowing of the light\n\n\n\nHere be dragons\n\nHere be death\n\nHere be the sombre that have felt the Devil's breath\n\nDon't you hear the distant howling of the wolf?\n\n\n\nDeath comes slow to you eternally\n\nOver oceans of time inexorably\n\n'Cause you'll feel, you'll feel the power\n\nFor the blood is the life\n\nUndead\n\nUnhallowed\n\nUnclean\n\n\n\nHere be dragons\n\nHere be death\n\nHere be the sombre that have felt the Devil's breath\n\nHere be dragons\n\nHere be death\n\nHere be the sombre that have felt the Devil's breath\n\nDon't you hear the distant howling of the wolf?"
