  "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\r\nMet her at a rave, never stopped grooving\r\nLost in a trance from telepopmusic\r\nI was so gone, she was so there\r\nI know I'm intoxicated but I don't care\r\nLights keep flashing, she keeps dancing\n\nShes trying to figure out why I keep glancing\n\nThis is my chance, I don't wanna miss it\n\nEye contact, something feels different\n\nTwo new worlds, our galaxy is distant\n\nI send my radiation, she started drifting\n\nTeleport her over my way that instant\n\nGrabbed, leaned in her ear and whispered\n\nIf your too high and you can't listen\n\nTune in to the new transmission\n\nStep out of life and make the transition\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nShe's so high, she reach the sky\n\nLook into her eyes, shes so high\n\nShe lives inside of clouds, her silence is loud\n\nShe screams without a sound shes so profound\n\n\n\n[Verse 2:]\n\nLeft from the rave, hopped in a spaceship\n\nOff to the hard drive, west of the matrix\n\nI was so high, didn't think I could make it\n\nPlus I kept envisioning the woman I was taking home\n\nGetting naked (clothes), baby take it (slow), ain't no way we gotta (go), I lay in my all pink UFO, land on a lily pad then we (coast), pour some? champagne and (toast), the bubbles from the champagne make us (float), aquatic clouds now we both need a (moat), she's the high I need the most\n\nMore than a woman, less than a queen, stuck in between\n\nReality and dreams\n\nThis feels like a movie scene, shes holographic without the screen, nah mean?\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nShe's so high, she reach the sky\n\nLook into her eyes, shes so high\n\nShe lives inside of clouds, her silence is loud\n\nShe screams without a sound shes so profound"
