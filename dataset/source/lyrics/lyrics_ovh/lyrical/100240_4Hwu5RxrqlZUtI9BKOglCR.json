Goddamn, I'm confused\n\n\n\nOkay I checked his plates and they came back clean\n\nBut I still better call some backup to the scene\n\nI don't know what he was reachin' for so I'm feelin' nauseous\n\nI just wanna make it home so I'm tryna be cautious\n\nGot a couple of arrests, but ain't no convictions\n\nGet out the squad car and my adrenaline kicks in\n\nSo not knowin' if he's committed any prior harm\n\nI walk up to his car with my hand on my firearm"
