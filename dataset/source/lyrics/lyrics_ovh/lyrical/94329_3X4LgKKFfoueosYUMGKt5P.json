  "lyrics": "Late nights, are you sleepless too?\r\nWide awake in the starless blue\r\nStaring up at the ceiling\r\nDo you feel what I'm feeling?\r\nLittle fights at the weekend do\r\nYou love me better when I'm not with you\n\nWe were built like concrete\n\nI used to know your heartbeat\n\n\n\nThe light has disappeared\n\nThe dust has settled here\n\nBut still I want you near\n\n\n\nSo I've been waiting for that slow fade\n\nKinda hoping that you won't stay\n\nThere's no color in us lately\n\nAnd it's too hard to say\n\nI've been praying that we'll lose our love in slow fade\n\n\n\nCrazy how it was me and you\n\nFrom the start of the sun and moon\n\nHeld each other through it\n\nWe were young and foolish\n\nNow we're dancing like we're done\n\nWe found the end of the moon and sun\n\nWas it always like this\n\n'Coz now it's always like this\n\n\n\nThe light has disappeared\n\nThe dust has settled here\n\nBut still I want you near\n\n\n\nSo I've been waiting for that slow fade\n\nKinda hoping that you won't stay\n\nThere's no color in us lately\n\nAnd it's too hard to say\n\nI've been praying that we'll lose our love in slow fade\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll find you again, maybe I won't\n\nI think for now that it's best if we let it go\n\nI hope you get all you want out of this life\n\nEven if it's not with me by your side\n\n\n\nSo I've been waiting for that slow fade\n\nKinda hoping that you won't stay\n\nThere's no color in us lately\n\nAnd it's too hard to say\n\nI've been praying that we'll lose our love in slow fade\n\nI've been praying that we'll lose our love in slow fade"
