  "lyrics": "We might try to run and get in front of it\nAnd we will never survive\nWe gotta wait for the free train to pass\nAnd while tryn'a stay alive, we die\n\nThese tracks separating us\n\nHumanity aside\n\nThe only way is to levitate\n\nAnd break the slate cause it'll never get clean\n\n\n\nPush and tug at the barriers\n\nSmile and bend down don't scare the officers\n\n[?] we aren't carriers\n\n\n\n(If you haven't found out)\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n\n\nThe colour of fear is white\n\nI can't hide my hide\n\nI wonder if the shoulders that I stand on\n\nCan feel that I'm not tryn'a push then down\n\n(Nah they did already)\n\nStill breathing or not\n\nStow away\n\nRed light\n\nMaking ammo and dead love for the man\n\n\n\nPull and tug at the carriages\n\nHighlight the safety of the passengers\n\n[?] we aren't scavengers\n\n\n\n(If you haven't found out)\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\nWhere you belong\n\n\n\nAh, ah\n\nI can't profess any family\n\nNo blood, no agony\n\nNo self-experienced [?]\n\nListen up: I'm just a first world prodigy\n\nSpittin' like I'm tryn'a be raggedy\n\nPretty boy with a pretty boy history\n\nPale imitator of peaceful mastery\n\nBut I'm just as angry\n\n(As Kendrick)\n\n\n\nPush and tug at the barriers\n\nSmile and bend down don't scare the officers\n\n[?] we aren't carriers\n\n\n\n(If you haven't found out)\n\nOh, if you haven't found out\n\n\n\nPull and tug at the carriages\n\nHighlight the safety of the passengers\n\nDon't scare 'em\n\n[?] we aren't scavengers\n\n\n\nOh, if you haven't found out\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\n(They won't let you know)\n\n(They won't let you know)"
