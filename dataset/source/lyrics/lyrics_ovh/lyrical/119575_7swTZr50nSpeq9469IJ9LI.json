  "lyrics": "Don't look so concerned\r\nYou can paint a bigger picture\r\nWhen you're so far off the ground\r\nWell it's okay if you're another one to learn\r\nYou've been smoking in the kitchen\r\nDrinking wine that's not your own\n\n\n\nWe saw it coming\n\nYou've been dancing on your own too long, the joker of the night\n\nYou know we're all not here for nothing\n\nLike a fire in the distance\n\nI can see but I can't help\n\n\n\nSo nothings changed\n\nYou've been lying through your teeth again\n\nThe lion's lost it's mane\n\nYou've been cornered into something you can't win\n\nWhat's the point in having something\n\nIf that something makes you thin?\n\n\n\nWe saw it coming,\n\nYou've been dancing on your own too long, the joker of the night\n\nYou know we're all not here for nothing\n\nLike a fire in the distance\n\nI can see but I can't help\n\n\n\nWe know you, you're not yourself\n\nFed up now, we'll get there soon\n\nTake a bow\n\nTake a bow\n\nTake a bow\n\nTake a bow\n\n\n\nWe know you, you're not yourself\n\nFed up now, we'll get there soon\n\nTake a bow\n\nTake a bow\n\nTake a bow\n\nTake a bow"
