  "lyrics": "You can change your life- if you wanna\r\nYou can change your clothes- if you wanna\r\nIf you change your mind\r\nWell, that's the way it goes\n\nBut I'm gonna keep your jeans\n\nAnd your old black hat- cause I wanna\n\nThey look good on me\n\nYou're never gonna get them back\n\nAt least not today, not today, not today\n\n'cause\n\n\n\n[CHORUS:]\n\nIf it's over, let it go and\n\nCome tomorrow it will seem\n\nSo yesterday, so yesterday\n\nI'm just a bird that's already flown away\n\n\n\nLaugh it off let it go and\n\nWhen you wake up it will seem\n\nSo yesterday, so yesterday\n\nHaven't you heard that I'm gonna be okay\n\n\n\nYou can say you're bored- if you wanna\n\nYou can act real tough- if you wanna\n\nYou can say you're torn\n\nBut I've heard enough\n\n\n\nThank you... you made my mind up for me\n\nWhen you started to ignore me\n\nDo you see a single tear\n\nIt isn't gonna happen here\n\nAt least not today, not today, not today\n\n'cause\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n\n\nIf you're over me, I'm already over you\n\nIf it's all been done, what is left to do\n\nHow can you hang up if the line is dead\n\nIf you wanna walk, I'm a step ahead\n\nIf you're moving on, I'm already gone\n\nIf the light is off then it isn't on\n\nAt least not today, not today, not today\n\n'cause\n\n\n\n[CHORUS 2X]"
