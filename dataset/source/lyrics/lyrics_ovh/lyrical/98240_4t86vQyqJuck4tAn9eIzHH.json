  "lyrics": "I bank on the funeral\r\n'Cause I learned all my lessons that way\r\nI chipped from my heaven’s sin\r\nUntil I stole everything that I made\r\nAnd this millstone is heavy as hell\n\nAnd I can't see so well\n\nAnd I still feel the swell\n\nAnd my hands and my feet are expelled\n\nBetter dead than in hell\n\nAnd again with the swell\n\n\n\nI bank on the funeral\n\n'Cause the truth is alive; it’s okay\n\nThe salt was in other words\n\nMore flavorful in those days\n\n\n\nAnd this millstone is heavy as hell\n\nAnd I can't see so well\n\nAnd I still feel the swell\n\nAnd my hands and my feet are expelled\n\nBetter dead than in hell\n\nAnd again with the swell\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly lesson learned could tell\n\nBetter dead than in hell\n\nOnly lesson learned could tell\n\nBetter dead than in hell\n\nOnly lesson learned could tell\n\nBetter dead than in hell"
