Be relentless\n\nHey! Be scared\n\n\n\nI'm on a mission\n\nTo make things right\n\n\n\nThis is the end of human wishes\n\nThis is the end of what we made\n\n\n\nHey! Stay informed\n\nHey! We were warned\n\nHey! I'm on a mission\n\nHey! Before the storm\n\n\n\nI'm on a mission\n\nTo make things right\n\n\n\nHey! I'm in the matrix\n\nHey! I'm in the right\n\n\n\nThe facts will always have their way\n\nIt's not for us to be dismissive\n\nThe truth will always have it's day\n\n\n\nThis is the end of human wishes\n\nThis is the end of what we made"
