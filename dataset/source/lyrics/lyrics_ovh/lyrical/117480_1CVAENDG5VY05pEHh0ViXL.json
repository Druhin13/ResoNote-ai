In fact, I'm dreaming\n\nCoconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets\n\nI got a shot at you, you wouldn't reach\n\nCop that, cock back, trigger release\n\nPop that top, take a sip of your holiest water\n\nI know I'm a part of your flow now\n\nTell me you cut her\n\nDon't matter you love her or not, you got part of her soul now\n\nI ain't know then, but I know now\n\nApologies due, to one of the few\n\nThe ones I ran through, but never loved you\n\nI pray you found peace and you whole now\n\nI'm doin' better, I got me a chocolate bar\n\nClimbin' on top of the bar\n\nThink of the shape, and I lick in the places you only gon' lick when you rock with her forever\n\n\n\nYou lost in the shape of my hips\n\nHope there is a mood\n\nAnd if you really down, we can find it\n\nLost in an alley, make love by a trash can, ayy (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nHope there is a mood (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\nAnd if you really down we can find it\n\nLost in an alley, make love\n\n\n\nShea butter baby, fuckin' up your pillow\n\n(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)\n\nShea Butter baby, fuckin' up your sheets\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\n(I can get close to you baby, pull me closer, what are you about?)"
