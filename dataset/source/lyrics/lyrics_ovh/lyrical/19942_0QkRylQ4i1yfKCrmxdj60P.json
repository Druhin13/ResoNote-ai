(Pain!)\n\n\n\nLet Your word run wild!\n\nAnd our hearts be filled with Your fire and reign\n\nand recognition of one true name! (Name!)\n\n\n\nLet the freedom come and the truth be seen!\n\nMy prayer is that all may know what You truly meant to me!\n\n\n\nUp from the underground!\n\nWe leave behind a legacy of praise!\n\n\n\nDon't perform for the crowd,\n\nbut reform for the crown!\n\n\n\nSleeping Giant!\n\n\n\nKingdom over everything!\n\n\n\nYou'll have the words of life\n\nYou'll see the fear in their eyes\n\nBut don't be intimidated\n\nThe darkness in them is just afraid of the light! (Light!)\n\n\n\nLet Your word run wild!\n\nAnd our hearts be filled with Your fire and reign\n\nand recognition of one true name! (Name!)\n\n\n\nLet the freedom come and the truth be seen!\n\nMy prayer is that all may know what You truly meant to me!\n\n\n\nChrist, my strength, my song!\n\nKnow, my life is yours\n\n'Til we meet again\n\nI will worship for an audience of One!\n\n\n\nFor an audience of One!\n\n\n\nWe leave behind a legacy of praise!"
