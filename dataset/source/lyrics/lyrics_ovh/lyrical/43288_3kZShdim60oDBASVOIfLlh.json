  "lyrics": "In your scripted play\nOn the stage you call home\nThere's no seat set for an unknown guest\n\nWhy the mean mouth\nThe many mirrors\n\nThose songs to end all hearing\n\n\n\nCome with me\n\nThe vast unknown awaits for us to see\n\nSomething so deeply hidden\n\nYet open before our eyes\n\n\n\nCatch the world in writing\n\nDraft a note or three\n\nListen to a farmer sing to a field\n\n\n\nTime for a starwalk\n\nTime to yearn Some twists 'n' turns\n\nCome with me\n\nThe vast unknown awaits for us to see\n\nSomething so deeply hidden\n\nYet everscriven, so\n\nCome with me I'll take you to the rings, I'll take you where\n\nThe sons and daughters of endlessness came to be\n\n\n\nCome, sit with me here for a while\n\nAmidst the dancing skies\n\nThey will tell what lies ahead:\n\nStrange comforts, curious canvases\n\nFront seat to history\n\nA seat for the guest unknown\n\n\n\nCome with me\n\nThe vast unknown awaits for us to see\n\nSomething so deeply hidden\n\nYet everscriven, so\n\nCome with me\n\nI'll take you to the rings, I'll take you where\n\nThe sons and daughters of endlessness came to be"
