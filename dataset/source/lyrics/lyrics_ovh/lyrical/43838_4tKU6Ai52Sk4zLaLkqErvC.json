  "lyrics": "All I need to know, she's dead to me\r\nEyes are runnin' strange, head's drivin' me insane\r\nAll I need to say, in every way\r\nDon't come running 'round my door, I'll kick my head into the floor\r\nThrough my vein, it's never been\n\nQuite like what I need to be, I'll send your bones to the sea\n\nMaybe, you'll never know\n\nI have been lost and found, I'll send my heart out to the hounds\n\n\n\nAhhhhhh\n\nAhhhhhh\n\n\n\nI'm feelin' old tonight\n\nBut I won't be anymore, no, it won't be anymore\n\nAhhh, take me in your stride\n\nNo, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore\n\nNo, we won't be anymore, no, I won't be anymore\n\nIf I am nothing, then you are no one\n\n\n\nLately, we've lost control of everything you're biddin' for\n\nYou keep me down, you set the score\n\nI've been impossible, only words are drowning out\n\nTake your head out of the clouds\n\n\n\nI'm feelin' old tonight\n\nNo, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore\n\nAhhh, take me in your stride\n\nNo, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore\n\nNo, I won't be anymore, no, we won't be anymore\n\nIf I am nothing, then you are no one\n\nIf I am nothing, you are no one\n\n\n\nLost it to no one, feelings in my head\n\nLost it to no one, feelings in my head\n\nLost it to no one, feelings in my head\n\nLost it to no one, feelings in my head\n\nLost it to no one, feelings in my head"
