  "lyrics": "We were burning we were looting\r\nWe were learning one or two things about life\r\nWe should fuck right in front of them\r\nJust to show them our light\r\nWe’ll be fucking we’ll be sucking\n\nWhile the rest of them were posting their lives\n\nThese kids will never rock again\n\nSign of the times\n\n\n\nYeah rimming and shooting\n\nI'm so destitute without your love\n\nYOU’RE MOTHER earth ecstasy\n\nI call it divine\n\n\n\nSpinning and hurting\n\nTheres no resolution tonight\n\nWhen will I breathe deep again again\n\nIs there laughter in sight?\n\n\n\n49 HAIRFLIPS\n\n49 HAIRFLIPS on DAYQUIL …\n\n\n\nI believe in you\n\nDo you believe in me ?\n\nNo we don’t believe in anything\n\n\n\nI’m not leaving these walls\n\nWithout the prettiest song I can find\n\nI miss your laugh most of all\n\nI really miss it tonight"
