  "lyrics": "Chills run through me, they cut through me\r\nA mental panic, I'm turning manic\r\nA hardened shell, it softens slowly\r\nIt's too much to take, it's too much to take\r\nYou say my name, a familiar face\n\nWe meet again, a different place\n\nYou call my name, meet face to face\n\nControl my life, I just keep pace\n\n\n\nYou can't refuse, they won't lose\n\nI stare away, countless miles\n\nI face the day, with a smile\n\nIt's too much to take, it's too much to take\n\n\n\nYou say my name, a familiar face\n\nWe meet again, a different place\n\nYou call my name, meet face to face\n\nControl my life, I just keep pace\n\n\n\nMy name dies today. Accept this suffering"
