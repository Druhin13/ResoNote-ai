  "lyrics": "You’re a living ghost\r\nLingering around my day\r\nHaunting my every thought\r\nIt's hard to come to terms\r\nThere’s no us left to hope for\r\nHaunting all of my senses\n\nCausing my dismay\n\nLeaving me in purgatory\n\n\n\nCause it‘s killing me\n\nTo see you like this\n\nI’m so afraid of how this will end\n\nCause I’m suffering\n\nThat will never change\n\nI can never forget\n\nYou are my phantom\n\nAt night I can’t fall asleep\n\nYou’re haunting my every dream\n\nMy heads in the clouds\n\nAnd my hearts overwhelmed\n\nI need your face to comfort myself\n\nBut you’re a ghost to me now\n\n\n\nIt’s been hard not to decay\n\nI’m going crazy in this silence\n\nIt’s hard to find purpose in the days\n\nWhen they’re quiet\n\nYour absence exposes how little I have\n\nAnd how insignificant I am\n\n\n\nIt’s killing me\n\nTo see you like this\n\nI’m so afraid of how this will end\n\nCause I’m suffering\n\nThat will never change\n\nI can never forget\n\nYou are my phantom\n\nAt night I can’t fall asleep\n\nYou’re haunting my every dream\n\nMy heads in the clouds\n\nAnd my hearts overwhelmed\n\nI need your face to comfort myself\n\nBut you’re a ghost to me now\n\n\n\nYou’re a ghost to me now\n\nIt's torture living here without you\n\nBut when we laid together it felt the same\n\nBecause there’s always been distance between us\n\nI’ve tried my hardest to let you go\n\nBut you haunt me, ghost\n\nYou haunt me"
