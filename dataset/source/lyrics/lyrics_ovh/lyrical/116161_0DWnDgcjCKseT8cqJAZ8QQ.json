  "lyrics": "Ey yeah\r\nAh ey\r\nWhen the world looks at me\r\nI wonder what they see\r\nUnderneath these eyes\n\nOh, smiles masquerade as pain\n\nAnd grow up to be shame\n\nThen leave me with a lie\n\n\n\nI know they, they don't see my flaws\n\nOr these hidden scars\n\nAnd all the mess I've made\n\nOh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya\n\nHere's my hallelujah\n\nEvery single day, I'm running to Your grace\n\nEy, ey, ey\n\n\n\nI'm tired of this dirty heart\n\nThat keeps our world apart\n\nI need Your loving fire\n\nAnd even in these church clothes\n\nI can't dress up my soul\n\nTo be free is my desire\n\n\n\nI'm so far from where they think I am\n\nBut when I raise my hands\n\nI'm reaching out for life\n\nOh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya\n\nHere's my hallelujah\n\nEvery single day, I'm running to Your grace\n\n\n\n\n\nI know they, they don't see my flaws\n\nOr these hidden scars\n\nAnd all the mess I've made\n\nOh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya\n\nHere's my hallelujah\n\nEvery single day, I'm running to Your grace\n\n\n\nRunning to Your grace\n\nOoh, I need it everyday"
