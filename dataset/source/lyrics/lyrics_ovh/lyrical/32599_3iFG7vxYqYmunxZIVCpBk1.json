They will take care of you\n\nRelax, you are unlikely to endure\n\n\n\nCaveman!\n\nWhen did you see the sky last time?\n\nHow deep is\n\nThat treasure you are told to find?\n\nThe reflect of what you feel, what you breathe\n\nIs that what you really are?\n\nCaveman!\n\nHey, caveman, what's your life so far?\n\n\n\nOnce the dust ate your eyes away\n\nAnd donated sweetest apathy\n\nBut still you sense your brothers' hollow heartbeat\n\nAnd gruff voices of your family\n\nI can see furrows on this face fouled with fly-ash\n\nThere's nothing remained but a tiny piece of coal in your chest\n\n\n\nBygone world was deprecated long ago\n\nNow, they are here to plunder your home\n\nBut don't mourn!\n\nShit!\n\n\n\nAbandon all hopes about freedom.\n\nNo hoard of value can replace it\n\nAbandon all hopes about freedom\n\nNo hoard of value can replace it.\n\n\n\nPunch a blunt fang of this rusty cavil into stones!\n\nCome on and fracture another course to the better world!\n\nGet down to work!\n\n\n\nDig! Harder! Faster! Deeper! Harder!\n\nDig! Harder! Faster! Deeper! Harder!\n\nDig! Harder! Faster! Deeper and harder!\n\nDig! Harder! Faster! Deeper! Harder!\n\nDig!"
