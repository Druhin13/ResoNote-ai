(how about)\n\nHow 'bout you get the fuck out?\n\nHow about you get the fuck out?\n\n(How 'bout you) take your tings and be on your merry way\n\n(How 'bout you) fly out for the week, bye bye, baby\n\n(How 'bout you) scusami, let me call your valet\n\n(How 'bout you) take your tings and be on your merry way\n\nHow 'bout you get the fuck out?\n\n(Fuck out, fuck out)\n\n\n\nDon't tell me these lies when you're bluffing\n\nHow 'bout you get the fuck out?\n\nGo stay at your friend's house or something\n\nDon't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave\n\n(How 'bout you)\n\nGo stay at your friend's house or something\n\n(How 'bout you)\n\nGo and stay with your homeboy, you was talking to\n\n(How 'bout you)\n\nI ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky\n\n(How 'bout you)\n\nI ain't kick your ass out last weekend\n\n\n\n(How 'bout you) take your tings and be on your merry way\n\n(How 'bout you) fly off with a wink\n\nBye bye, baby"
