  "lyrics": "As he takes from me my last breath, inhale\r\nI’m picking up the scent\r\nWhat a hell of a feeling\r\nIt is dark all day\r\nBut there is something in the sky that glows\n\nWhat a hell of a feeling\n\nWith such a brilliant mind\n\nCan you feel those chemicals in the air tonight\n\n\n\nI will see you on the other side\n\nI am your night girl, rip my heart out\n\nDarkness falling yet another night\n\nCome on Lost Boys, let’s stay alive\n\n\n\nWhat a hell of a day to embrace disorder\n\nAnd there is something in your eyes that burns\n\nLight up. Drag the river\n\nCan you see there are chemicals in the air tonight\n\n\n\nI will see you on the other side\n\nI am your night girl, rip my heart out\n\nDarkness falling yet another night\n\nCome on Lost Boys, let’s stay alive\n\n\n\nLet’s fly\n\n\n\nI will see you on the other side\n\nI am your night girl, rip my heart out\n\nDarkness falling yet another night\n\nCome on Lost Boys, let’s stay alive\n\n\n\nGoodnight my Lost Boys\n\nThou shall not fear\n\nGoodnight my sweetheart"
