(How did this happen?)\n\n\n\nI see you walk past the demonstration\n\nTwo chips on your shoulder\n\nYou're a culture connoisseur and your pain is real\n\nTwo chips on your shoulder\n\n\n\nStuck wading through a crowd of radical daughters\n\nBarricades armed by empty strollers\n\nBasic slogans to combat controllers\n\nSee them dance from afar, to guitar on your shoulder\n\n\n\nAs you smugly walk past, think:\n\nThese people should be here regardless of outcome\n\nAs you smugly walk past, think:\n\nHey there's a half-off sale at the Barnes and Noble\n\n\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?\n\n\n\nYou're cueing deep cuts as you glide escalator\n\nTwo chips on your shoulder\n\nFace pressed to glass looking down at the mass march\n\nTwo cans on your shoulder\n\n\n\nYour playlist knows you better than a closest lover\n\nYour playlist always desert island disk\n\nYour playlist will curate you songs of the oppressed\n\nLook at the marquee in 1080p\n\n\n\nAs you smugly walk past, think:\n\nThese people should be here regardless of outcome\n\nAs you smugly walk past, think:\n\nYou've got an island of blue, you've got a nipple in water\n\n\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?\n\n\n\nIt's new world now, don't discriminate\n\nEveryone is equally a master and a slave\n\nIt's new world now, don't discriminate\n\nEveryone is equally a master and a slave\n\n\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?\n\n\n\nThis machine you know it don't kill fascists\n\nThis machine just softens what's hard\n\nThis machine it killed the dream of the sixties\n\nThis machine you know it's just a guitar\n\n\n\nAs you smugly walk past, you ask yourself\n\nHow did this happen?"
