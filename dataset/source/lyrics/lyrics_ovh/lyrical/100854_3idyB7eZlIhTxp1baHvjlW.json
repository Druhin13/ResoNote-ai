  "lyrics": "There is a swelling storm\r\nAnd I'm caught up in the middle of it all\r\nAnd it takes control\r\nOf the person that I thought I was\r\nThe boy I used to know\n\nBut there is a light\n\nIn the dark\n\nAnd I feel its warmth\n\nIn my hands\n\nIn my heart\n\nWhy can't I hold on\n\n\n\n'Cause it comes and goes in waves\n\nIt always does\n\nIt always does\n\nWe watch as our young hearts fade\n\nInto the flood\n\nInto the flood\n\n\n\nAnd the freedom\n\nof falling\n\nThe feeling I thought was set in stone\n\nIt slips through my fingers\n\nTrying hard to let go\n\nBut it comes and goes in waves\n\n'Cause it comes and goes in waves\n\nAnd carries us away\n\n\n\nThrough the wind\n\nDown to the place we used to lay when we were kids\n\nMemories of a stolen place\n\nCaught in the silence\n\nAn echo lost in space\n\n\n\n'Cause it comes and goes in waves\n\nIt always does\n\nIt always does\n\nWe watch as our young hearts fade\n\nInto the flood\n\nInto the flood\n\n\n\nAnd the freedom\n\nof falling\n\nThe feeling I thought was set in stone\n\nIt slips through my fingers\n\nTrying hard to let go\n\nBut it comes and goes in waves\n\n'Cause it comes and goes in waves\n\nAnd carries us away\n\n\n\nI watched my world youth disappear in front of my eyes\n\nMoments of magic and wonder\n\nIt seems so hard to find\n\nIs it ever coming back again\n\nIs it ever coming back again\n\nTake me back to the feeling when\n\nEverything was left to find\n\n'Cause it comes and goes in waves\n\nIt always does\n\nIt always does\n\n\n\nAnd the freedom\n\nof falling\n\nThe feeling I thought was set in stone\n\nIt slips through my fingers\n\nTrying hard to let go\n\nBut it comes and goes in waves\n\n'Cause it comes and goes in waves\n\nAnd carries us away"
