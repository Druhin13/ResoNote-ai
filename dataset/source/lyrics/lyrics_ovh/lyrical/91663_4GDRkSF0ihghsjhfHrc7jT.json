  "lyrics": "My heart is like a haunted house\r\nThere's things in there that scratch about\r\nThey make their music in the night\r\nAnd in the day they give me such a fright\r\nMy heart is like a haunted house\n\nThere's things in there that scream and shout\n\nThey make their music in the night\n\nWish I could find a way to let them out, oh\n\n\n\nDo you remember winding your arm around my shoulder\n\nAs we wandered 'round the hill?\n\nNow I'm in that fog forever\n\nAnd full collaboration with the weather 'cause\n\n\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at all (Ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\nI'm not free at...\n\n\n\nMy heart is like a haunted house\n\nThere's things in there that scratch about\n\nThey make their music in the night\n\nAnd in the day they give me such a fright"
