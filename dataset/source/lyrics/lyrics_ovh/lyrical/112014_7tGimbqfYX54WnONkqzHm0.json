I can't say I don't\r\nPut me on trial but I won't tell\r\nIf I want you and I always will\r\nUh huh uh huh\r\nRight hand on the Bible\n\nUh huh uh huh\n\nThe other on a bottle\n\n\n\nHave I ever mixed your memory with Tennessee?\n\nHave I ever dialed you up, but never let it ring?\n\nDo I wonder where you are with every sip?\n\nGetting onto who you might be with\n\nDrown myself in 90 proof, what else?\n\nI plead the fifth\n\n\n\nWell if you showed up at my door tonight\n\nWould I let you in without a fight?\n\nAnd If a little kiss led to the bed\n\nWould we wake up with no regrets?\n\nUh huh uh huh\n\nAny minute but I won't lie\n\nUh huh uh huh\n\nProudly love you till the day I die\n\n\n\nHave I ever mixed your memory with Tennessee?\n\nHave I ever dialed you up, but never let it ring?\n\nDo I wonder where you are with every sip?\n\nGetting onto who you might be with\n\nDrown myself in 90 proof, what else?\n\nI plead the fifth\n\nUh huh uh huh\n\nUh huh uh huh\n\n\n\nI plead the fifth\n\nJust one more shot\n\nI guess the heart wants what it wants\n\nI plead the fifth\n\nWon't say a word\n\nWon't tell you just how much it hurts\n\nI plead the fifth\n\nJust one more shot\n\nI guess the heart wants what it wants\n\n\n\nHave I ever mixed your memory with Tennessee?\n\nHave I ever dialed you up, but never let it ring?\n\nDo I wonder where you are with every sip?\n\nGetting onto who you might be with\n\nDrown myself in 90 proof, what else?\n\nI plead the fifth\n\nI plead the fifth\n\nI plead the fifth"
