  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Gold Hole par Shame\r\nHe bought her diamonds\nHe bought her pearls\nHe made her whisper that she's daddy's girl\nShe wants the money\nIt comes with his cream\nSo she closes her eyes and pretends it's a dream\n\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\n\nSweat stains the wrinkles\nTongue touches the hole\n\nHis wife's at work and his kids are at school\nShe feels so dirty\nShe knows that it's wrong\nBut she feels so good in Louis Vuitton\n\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\n\nShake me up\nPop my cork\nFeel me drip\nWhile you talk\nLet me in\n\nI want to stay\nI'll wear you down girl\nI'll buy a way\nYou got a gold hole sugar\nYou got a gold hole sugar\nYou got a gold hole sugar\nYou got a gold hole sugar\nAnd it makes me feel like I am rich\nAnd it makes me feel like I am rich\nAnd it makes me feel like I am rich\nIt makes me scratch that tender itch\n\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up\nShake me up"
