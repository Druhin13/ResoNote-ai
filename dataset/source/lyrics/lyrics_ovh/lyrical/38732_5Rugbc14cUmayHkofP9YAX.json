  "lyrics": "Yeah, mhm\r\nForgot where I left off\r\nDay ones say they can't feel me\r\nFake ones hope that I fail\r\nLowkey think that they fear me\r\nI've been out on my own\n\nI don't need labels, you hear me\n\nStand outside, catch me outside\n\nHonestly, think that's just lazy\n\nThey want that quick cash\n\nSmack 'em 'til they get whiplash\n\nI wanna grow my fanbase\n\nThey just wanna get rich fast\n\nSit back, calm down, read your tweets\n\nSay I'm garbage, un-unique\n\nI don't write for you, I write for me\n\nSo just let that sink\n\nSay I changed? Haha, well of course I did, I'm livin' life\n\nI'm perfect, chasin' something that's so worth the risk\n\nSay I changed because of auto-tune\n\nIronically, you never knew it\n\nThe real me, you say's missin'\n\nIs back again, back again\n\n\n\n\"Feel like I lost you,\" ooh\n\nYou say, \"I feel like I lost you,\" ooh\n\nYou say, \"I feel that I lost you,\" ooh, ooh\n\nBut that man never left, no\n\nYou feel like you lost me\n\nYou say you feel like you lost me\n\nYou say you feel like you lost me, yeah, yeah\n\nBut that man never left, yeah\n\nNo, that man never left, no\n\nYeah, that man never left, ugh\n\n\n\nYeah, dealing with things, last two years been crazy\n\nStill cannot find love, but how can you blame me?\n\nGeneration with no strings attached, been feelin' normal\n\nGoing up to every feelin', lately she says I'm immortal\n\nI'm a male with some problems you don't see\n\nIf I'm open in my lyrics, I'm afraid that they might leave\n\nOr they might see something from my past that they don't wanna see\n\nI believe in God, but is it for my family or for me? Yeah\n\n\n\nYou say you feel like you lost me\n\nYou say you feel like you lost me\n\nYou say you feel like you lost me\n\nWell, that man never left, nah!\n\nThat man never left, nah\n\nThat man never left, nah\n\nI've been goin' through some things you don't wanna see, agh\n\nYou don't wanna see, you don't wanna see\n\nI've been goin' through some things that you don't wanna see\n\nYou don't wanna see, you don't wanna see, no\n\n\n\n\"I feel like I lost you-ou\"\n\n\"I feel like I lost you-ou\"\n\n\"I feel like I lost you-ou\"\n\n\n\nFor the fans that stayed around\n\nYou got me through so much in this last year\n\nYou got me through so much, yeah\n\nAnd for the fans that are just coming back\n\nI was going through some stuff these last few years, and\n\nUh, maturing a lot more\n\nNow I'm learning why I'm here\n\nWhat's my purpose\n\nIt's music"
