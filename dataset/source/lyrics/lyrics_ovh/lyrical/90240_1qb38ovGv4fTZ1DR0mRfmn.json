  "lyrics": "The list of things I could live without\r\nGrows longer as I move everything around\r\nBehind all the furniture\r\nPointed toward her\r\nTo keep her in my sights\r\nTo keep her in my life\n\n\n\nBy all means, she can get ahead of herself\n\nI had already be there\n\nI'll already be there to meet her\n\n\n\nShe's no traitor\n\nI've got no chaser\n\nFor a leg up\n\nI've got no chaser\n\nShe's no traitor\n\nFor a joint account\n\nShe gave me everything that she had left\n\n\n\n(She doesn't love)\n\nAnything for herself\n\nBut for me, she goes way in, way in, way into the red\n\n\n\nShe saw every hand in my pocket\n\nShe sold her gold rush\n\nShe watched me lose face every day\n\nRather than lose me\n\nShe was the gold rush, she was the gold rush\n\nShe was the gold rush\n\nShe sold every hand in her pocket\n\nAnd she sawed off every hand\n\n\n\n(She doesn't love)\n\nAnything for herself\n\nBut for me, she goes way in, way in, way into the red\n\n\n\nShe saw every hand in my pocket\n\nShe sold her gold rush\n\nShe watched me lose face every day\n\nRather than lose me\n\nShe was the gold rush, she was the gold rush\n\nShe was the gold rush, she was the gold rush\n\nShe was the gold rush, she was the gold rush\n\n\n\nWhat I have will believe you until now\n\nEven doing nothing I am making the most of somehow\n\nAnd the credit goes to her\n\nIt's the bad day speaking red\n\nGotta keep her in my sights\n\nGotta keep her in my life\n\n\n\nBy all means, she can get ahead of herself\n\nI had already be there\n\nI'll already be there to meet her"
