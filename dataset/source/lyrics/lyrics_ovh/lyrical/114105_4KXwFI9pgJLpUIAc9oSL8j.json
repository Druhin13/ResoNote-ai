(Fairway)\n\nDamn right I need all this (all this)\n\nYeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy\n\n\n\nHittas acquitted with fingerprints on the Glock\n\nScreamin' we gon' make it like two-thirds of The LOX\n\nYeah yeah, yeah yeah\n\nBlah blah, he comes, blah blah\n\n\n\nBlood on my hands I'ma need hot agua\n\nYou gon' meet your maker I won't say it in Patois\n\nHope I strike a nerve like a pack of matches\n\nYou might wanna bypass, this smoke ain't gas trick\n\nA prince-turned-pauper trying to do like kings do\n\nSweating in chess games try move like kings move\n\nYou should slow your roll before you drown in the moat\n\nHe tried to channel balance but never found the remote\n\nKillers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick\n\nStealing, with a double for his *bleep*\n\nCommon politics, everlasting mayhem\n\nDraw to stick you for your figures, that's how they hang man\n\nSo what's your game plan, if you got one?\n\nYou aimin' at passengers with a shotgun? (Woah)\n\nThe aftermath is you in the scope\n\nIt's warfare, is war fair? (No)\n\nYou understand? It's probably better you don't\n\nJust keep a dock on standby, charter a boat\n\nShip set sailing, planes depart\n\nThe big picture's in motion, are you playing your part?\n\nBefore the lights get dark and the curtains get closed\n\nAre you playing your role?\n\nAs told by an organized criminal\n\nAnd general, get off my genitals, I got your general\n\n\n\nHail Mary's in the sky\n\nBossed up, let's get buried alive\n\nHead on the throne 'cause that's where I reside (reside)\n\nWays of the world that we won't survive\n\nSomething's in the water (the water)\n\nMy nigga we lawless (lawless)\n\nPlease move with caution\n\nWho set the fairway? (Fairway)\n\nDamn right I need all this (all this)\n\nYeah, Jack, I need all this\n\n\n\nI had to be about 9 when I first had seen it\n\nLow lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's\n\nAfter a car show at Dominguez\n\nThey had a disagreement, they had to air out\n\nJust another day in Del Amo\n\nFo' sho man down, mando\n\nThank God I never had to knock your partner off\n\nOr be an another casualty of war, Amen\n\nThere's 4 footprints in the sand where I walk\n\nI never claimed to be a saint at all\n\nFour Russians trippin' with hollow tips\n\nAnd a Kalashnikov, ain't that y'all\n\nNo, Soulo hoe, kept it clean\n\nRiding dirty, jury would have gave me thirty\n\nHerbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded\n\nElectorial college devoted\n\nTo hit the score, to write the score, that's not a metaphor\n\nRaging against the machinery, taping up the scenery\n\nYou gotta keep the piece, to keep the peace\n\nGot dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleaning fee\n\n\n\nI don't need you to change\n\nI don't need you to change yourself (get, get away)\n\nBut I've got get away (get, get away)\n\nBut I've got get away from it all\n\nBe as free as you can\n\nBe as free as you can away from me\n\nI tried to be a saint like everybody else"
