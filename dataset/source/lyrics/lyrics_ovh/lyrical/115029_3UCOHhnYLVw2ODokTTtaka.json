  "lyrics": "Take a look at the clock only so long to go\r\nScrubbing smooth young skin saying I don't know\r\nGrab a bag, grab a bottle but leave the what if\r\nYou'll see it in the morning after your kicks\r\nAll you will need for a rocking good time\n\nIs a bunch of people who don't give a damn\n\nThere's a yes, in your head, gotta find where it's at\n\nYou'll lose it in the morning but ignore that\n\n\n\nAnd we're not bruised, they're just party tattoos\n\nAnd that colourful mess is just colourful regret\n\nBlack lipstick will never be a sin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nRegret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\n\n\nMy mummy said to always wear a coat\n\nBut it's warm and it's heavy and we're trying to float\n\nDon't forget she'll be right when it's 3am\n\nSo shiver, but shiver with a friend\n\n\n\nAnd we're not bruised they're just party tattoos\n\nAnd that colourful mess is just colourful regret\n\nBlack lipstick will never be a sin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nWe're not bruised they're just party tattoos\n\nAnd that colourful mess is just colourful regret\n\nBlack lipstick will never be a sin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nRegret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\n\n\nWrite a postcard to you at 84\n\nTell them you'd never dream of living behind the door\n\nLife was fun, full of love, full of hopeful smiles\n\nBet you wish you were here, but I'll see you in a while\n\n\n\nAnd we're not bruised they're just party tattoos\n\nAnd that colourful mess is just colourful regret\n\nBlack lipstick will never be a sin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nWe're not bruised they're just party tattoos\n\nAnd that colourful mess is just colourful regret\n\nBlack lipstick will never be a sin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nWe'll regret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin\n\nRegret it when we're old with wrinkled up skin"
