  "lyrics": "Maybe one day\r\nI won't sing about you\r\nI'll sing a song about someone new\r\nBut right here, right now\r\nYou are on my mind\r\nAnd I think about you all the time\n\nI'm sending a message to you\n\nAnd I'm hoping that it will get through\n\n\n\nWhen it was good it was bittersweet honey\n\nYou made me sad til I loved the shade of blue\n\nI know you don't want to talk to me\n\nSo this is what I will do\n\nMaybe you're listening\n\nSo here's one last song for you\n\nHere's one last song for you\n\n\n\nAnd I hope it makes you feel\n\nAnd I hope it makes you burn\n\nAnd I hope it reminds you of how much it hurt\n\nI'm sending a message to you\n\nAnd I'm hoping that it will get through\n\n\n\nWhen it was good it was bittersweet honey\n\nYou made me sad til I loved the shade of blue\n\nI know you don't want to talk to me\n\nSo this is what I will do\n\nMaybe you're listening\n\nSo here's one last song for you\n\n\n\nIn case you hear this\n\nThen know you're the love of my life\n\nWant to tell you I'm sorry\n\nI miss having you by my side\n\nWhen you were mine\n\n\n\nWhen it was good it was bittersweet honey\n\nYou made me sad til I loved the shade of blue\n\nI know you don't want to talk to me\n\nSo this is what I will do\n\nMaybe you're listening\n\nSo here's one last song for you\n\nHere's one last song for you"
