  "lyrics": "Are we really this far gone?\r\nWe yell upstream to watch it fall\r\nHave we still the faintest clue?\r\nThe past repeats to nothing new\r\nEvery day is a shot in the dark and we're tested\n\nFate [?] more or less than\n\nIt's nothing new, oh-oh-oh, oh\n\n\n\nI know my ties when I'm cutting loose\n\n'Cause I'm not gonna waste my time\n\nAnd I'm locked in a noose\n\nBut if I can't help myself, I'm giving in, in\n\nLike all of the times I've held you up to let you win\n\n\n\nBut it's hard, and it hurts, and I'm tired\n\n'Cause I run when you chase me\n\nAlone, I'm losing strength\n\n\n\nAre we really this far gone?\n\nWe yell upstream to watch it fall\n\nHave we still the faintest clue?\n\nThe past repeats to nothing new"
