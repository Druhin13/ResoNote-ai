  "lyrics": "It's an emergency, call the police\r\nYou left me and abandoned the lease\r\nAnd I don’t know why you’re gone\r\nI walk these floors like a country song\r\nOh, where you been? I called all your friends\r\nThey were hush hush on what's happening\n\nAnd I called your momma too, she never could get through to you\n\nI don't care if you love me, don't care if you don't\n\nI don't really care anymore\n\nI gave you everything\n\nI don't care if you come, don't care if you go\n\nI don't really care anymore\n\nI gave you everything\n\nMy bags are packed, now you want me back\n\nNow you are the one with the panic attack\n\nThe pendulum has swung\n\nNow I don't need you, don't need anyone\n\nOh, ring, ring, ring, it's a terrible thing\n\nSuffering, you won't stop calling\n\nYou're beggin' and you plead\n\nBut it's too late for apologies"
