  "lyrics": "Well I'll be on my way\r\nThis is what she told me, told me\r\nThat I've got to much on my plate\r\nBaby you don't know me, know me\r\nSo why am I afraid\r\nTo be the one who asks the questions\n\nI'm looking for directions\n\nSorta hoping you'd explain\n\n\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking\n\nMan your were looking for\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking for\n\n\n\nI think you thought this was a game\n\nBut the rules are there for breaking, breaking\n\nSo I guess I am to blame\n\nThat's why my heart is aching, aching\n\nWhile my bodies numb\n\nI'll continue looking for the answer\n\nYour love is like a cancer\n\nAnd I hope its not to late\n\n\n\nTo be the man that you were looking\n\nMan your were looking for\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking for\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking for\n\n\n\nRunning, always running\n\nAway\n\nAll I need, is for you to stay\n\nRunning, always running\n\nAway\n\nAll I need, is for you to say\n\n\n\nThat I'm the man that you were looking for\n\nGonna be the man that you were looking for\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking for\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking for\n\nHow to be the man that you were looking for"
