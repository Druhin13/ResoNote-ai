  "lyrics": "I want to stay, I want to go\r\nI want to feel, I want to know, I\r\nI want to creep, delicately\r\nTowards a life that I want to lead, I\r\nI used to feel like I could die\r\nI used to feel like the dragging of time\n\nWanted to be, the other me\n\nBut yesterday came so suddenly\n\n\n\nI want to live 'til the end of days\n\nI want to shiver and shake\n\nI want to live like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI want to live in between the lines\n\nI want to bathe in my brain\n\nI want to love like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI want to love, I want to lead\n\nI want to dive right into the sea, I\n\nI want to swim, to foreign shores\n\nI want to breathe, I want it more, I\n\nI used to feel like I would die\n\nLike days of change were just passing me by\n\nAnd now you creep, so suddenly\n\nAnd now it's you who'll be the end of me\n\n\n\nI want to live 'til the end of days\n\nI want to shiver and shake\n\nI want to live like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI want to live in between the lines\n\nI want to bathe in my brain\n\nI want to love like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI know that you're tired\n\nBut no, you've time\n\nOh, no, no\n\nOh it won't be this way\n\nIt won't be this way\n\n\n\nI want to live 'til the end of days\n\nI want to shiver and shake\n\nI want to live like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI want to live in between the lines\n\nI want to bathe in my brain\n\nI want to love like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI want to live 'til the end of days\n\nI want to shiver and shake\n\nI want to live like you've never seen another way\n\n\n\nI want to live in between the lines\n\nI want to bathe in my brain\n\nI want to love like you've never seen another way"
