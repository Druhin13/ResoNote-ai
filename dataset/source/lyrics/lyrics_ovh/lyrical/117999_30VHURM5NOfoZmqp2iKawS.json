  "lyrics": "I was just coasting, never really going anywhere\r\nCaught up in a web, I was getting kind of use to staying there\r\nAnd out of the blue\r\nI fell for you\r\nNow you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down\n\nStealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown\n\nUntangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied\n\nI didn't know him and I didn't know me\n\nCloud nine, was always out of reach\n\nNow I remember what it feels like to fly\n\nYou give me butterflies\n\n\n\nKiss full of color, makes me wonder where you've always been\n\nI was hiding in doubt, 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis\n\nAnd I came out new\n\nAll because of you\n\n\n\nNow you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down\n\nStealing my heart, 'stead of stealing my crown\n\nUntangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied\n\nI didn't know him and I didn't know me\n\nCloud nine, was always out of reach\n\nNow I remember what it feels like to fly\n\nYou give me butterflies\n\nYeah, you give me butterflies\n\n\n\nNow you're lifting me up, 'stead of holding me down\n\nYou're taking my hand, 'stead of taking my crown\n\nUntangled all the strings, round my wings, that were tied\n\nI didn't know him and I didn't know me\n\nCloud nine, was always out of reach\n\nNow I remember what it feels like to fly\n\nYou give me butterflies, hmm\n\nYou give me butterflies"
