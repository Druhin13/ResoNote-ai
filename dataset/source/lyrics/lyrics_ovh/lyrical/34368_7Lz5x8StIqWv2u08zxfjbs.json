  "lyrics": "I didn't think I'd love you like the past\r\n'Cos everything you gave me didn't last\r\nI never heard a woman calling out my name\r\nWith the love and power and the passion that you gave\r\nSo hold me in your arms and say you're mine\n\nAnd you can break my heart just one more time\n\n\n\nI couldn't bear to see your face again\n\nIt takes me years to overcome the pain\n\nI'm praying to the sky above\n\nNever let me ever fall in love\n\n\n\nSo hold me in your arms and say you're mine\n\nAnd you can break my heart just one more time"
