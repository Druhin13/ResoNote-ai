  "lyrics": "My friend told me of a secret\r\nTold me that she blames herself\r\nYou invaded her magnificence\r\nPut your hand over her mouth\r\nWhy was she all alone\n\nWearing her shirt that low\n\nThey said, \"Boys will be boys\"\n\nDeaf to the word no\n\n\n\nYour father told you that you're innocent\n\nTold you that women rape themselves\n\nWould you blame your little sister\n\nIf she cried to you for help\n\n\n\nWhy was she all alone\n\nWearing her shirt that low\n\nThey said, \"Boys will be boys\"\n\nDeaf to, deaf to\n\nDeaf to the word\n\nNo, no, no, no\n\n\n\nLike a mower in the morning\n\nI will never let you rest\n\nYou broke all the bonds she gave you\n\nTime to pay the fucking rent"
