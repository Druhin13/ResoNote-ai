  "lyrics": "Iâ€™ve been telling my friends I'm cool I finally got you out my head\r\nAnd if I gotta walk by your house I take the long way home instead\r\nCause I guess if I see you outside and you look all cute and I won't let myself forget\r\nCause every time, every time, every time I see you I know I'm not ready yet\r\nNo I don't want somebody else\n\nFeels like I'm going through hell\n\nSo I just lie to myself\n\nJust to prove...\n\n\n\nI'm not thinking 'bout you, you\n\nI'm not thinking 'bout you, you\n\nI don't wanna think about...\n\n\n\nYou've got me feeling things I swear that I have never felt\n\nAnd you have a way with saying words that always stick around\n\nAnd if I saw you outside, hanging out with another guy\n\nLike you're better off without\n\nNo I would try, I would try, I would try\n\nTo look away till I convince myself\n\n\n\nNo I don't want somebody else\n\nFeels like I'm going through hell\n\nSo I just lie to myself\n\nJust to prove...\n\n\n\nI'm not thinking 'bout you, you\n\nI'm not thinking 'bout you, you\n\nNo I don't wanna think about...\n\nNo I don't wanna think about you, no-oh\n\n\n\nSuddenly I'm think 'bout...\n\nAll the times we had, keep on rushing back\n\nAnd up my head, I don't wanna think about...\n\nWhat I'm feeling now, I wanna push it down\n\nAnd block it out\n\n\n\nI don't wanna think about you, you\n\nNo I don't wanna think about, you-ooh...\n\nNo I don't wanna think about\n\nNo I don't wanna think about you\n\nNo I don't wanna think about..."
