  "lyrics": "When the old soles have shoes are worn through\r\nAnd it's too far to find a way home\r\nYou're feeling older than you used to\r\nCan't stop thinking you'll be left alone\r\nDon't you worry now\n\nDon't let life get you down\n\nJust remember you're mine\n\n\n\nWhen I see you in the high and low\n\nIn the high and low, I have found you\n\nAnd I see you anywhere you go\n\nAnywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere\n\n\n\nThe sun is so cold, as you reach for\n\nMy oldest T-shirt to keep you warm\n\nWe'll never grow old, we'll never want more\n\nThis love will weather in the storm\n\n\n\nDon't you worry now\n\nDon't let life get you down\n\nJust remember you're mine\n\n\n\nWhen I see you in the high and low\n\nIn the high and low, I have found you\n\nAnd I see you anywhere you go\n\nAnywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere\n\n\n\nWhen I see you in the high and low\n\nIn the high and low, I have found you\n\nAnd I see you anywhere you go\n\nAnywhere you go, I've followed you anywhere"
