  "lyrics": "Cross my heart and hope to die\r\nYou never cross my fucking mind\r\nDo you know what your little lies, do\r\nYou know what I had to fight through\r\nNothing that you say is mildly true\r\nSpit deceit through shifty smiles through, faces\n\nYou fight for a while, you act like such a fucking child\n\nWho are you now?\n\nYou're so hostile to me\n\nI'm feeling homicidal\n\nYou better run and try and hide\n\nBut I was slipping in denial\n\nThrough all this time you had me riled up\n\nAll the shit has finally piled up\n\nThere's no chance of reconciling us\n\nWith the falsehoods I’ve been filing up\n\nWait for months, you’ve made these stories up\n\nSick from me, and chose to throw it up\n\nHad me thinkin' I was crazy, but\n\nTurns out I'm your favorite thing to discuss\n\nYou keep on talking shit about\n\nYou keep rubbing salt into the cut\n\nBroke the cycle, need to reconstruct\n\nYou're no use to me, I give it up\n\nBaby, you're a loser and I'm ashamed to say I ever knew 'ya\n\nA user taken, all I'd give 'ya\n\nI swear to God I'll never miss 'ya\n\nSwear to God I haven't missed 'ya\n\nGod, I hope I'll never miss 'ya"
