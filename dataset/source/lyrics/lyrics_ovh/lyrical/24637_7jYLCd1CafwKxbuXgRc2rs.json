  "lyrics": "We were drifting like two icebergs out on the ocean\r\nI was doing all I could to keep you close\r\nThere were troubles in the water, you swore it was nothing\r\nYou said that we would always stay afloat\r\nWhy would true love look me in the eye and lie... lie...\n\nI thought we’d be together till we die\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\nI thought we’d be together till we die\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\n\n\nWhy have you been coming home so late in the evening\n\nIs there someone else that I should know about\n\nThere’s a smile on your face that I haven’t seen\n\nSince we started going out\n\n\n\nHow could true love look me in the eye and lie... lie...\n\nI thought we’d be together till we die\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\nI thought we’d be together till we die\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\nI’ll forever wonder why (You let go of me, you let go of me)\n\n\n\nWe said until death do us part and then you chose to break my heart\n\nRemember right back to the start\n\nWe said we’d be together till we die\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\nI thought we’d be together till we die\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\n\n\nYou said we’d be together till we die\n\n(You let go of me, you let go of me)\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\n(You let go of me, you let go of me)\n\nI thought we’d be together till we die\n\n(You let go of me, you let go of me)\n\nI’ll forever wonder why\n\n(You let go of me, you let go of me)\n\nI’ll forever wonder why"
