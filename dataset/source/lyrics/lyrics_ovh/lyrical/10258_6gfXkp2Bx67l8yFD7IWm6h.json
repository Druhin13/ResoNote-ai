  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Pretend par Goody Grace\r\nFuck you and your high class friends\nThey wouldn't know the difference between love and sex\nAnd I wouldn't say intelligence is something they possess\nAt least I haven't noticed in the time we've spent\nOn the weekends when we pretend that we're something more than friends\nWhen we sleep in and it feels like how we feel we'll never end\n\nAnd we pretend\nWe pretend\nWe pretend\nWe pretend\n\n\nFuck you and your new boyfriend\nI bet he doesn't know the things that I know and\nI bet he doesn't know your hidden love for punk bands\nOr your infatuation with drunk romance\nCan we pretend that you leave him and we can be more than friends?\nWe can return to how we were when we met\n\nAnd we'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\n\nFuck you and what your parents say\nI'm sorry that I doubted when you said that they're insane\n\nCause they always said I don't know how to act my age\nThey always said that I'm no good for you but hey\nCan we pretend on the weekend that we maybe more than friends?\nWe can sleep in all weekend again\n\nAnd we'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nOh we'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nWe'll pretend\nOh we'll pretend"
