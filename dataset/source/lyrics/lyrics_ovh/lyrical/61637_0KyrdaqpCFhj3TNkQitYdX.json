  "lyrics": "You know I like my chicken fried\r\nA cold beer on a Friday night\r\nA pair of jeans that fit just right\r\nAnd the radio up\r\nWell I was raised up beneath \n\nthe shade of a Georgia pine\n\nAnd that`s home you know\n\nSweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine\n\nWhere the peaches grow\n\nAnd my house it`s not much to talk about\n\nBut it`s filled with love that`s grown\n\nin southern ground\n\n\n\nAnd a little bit of chicken fried\n\nCold beer on a Friday night\n\nA pair of jeans that fit just right\n\nAnd the radio up\n\nWell I`ve seen the sunrise\n\nSee the love in my woman`s eyes\n\nFeel the touch of a precious child\n\nAnd know a mother`s love\n\n\n\nAnd it's funny how it`s the little things in life \n\nthat mean the most\n\nNot where you live, what you drive, \n\nor the price tag on your clothes\n\nThere`s no dollar sign on a piece of mind \n\nthis I`ve come to know\n\nSo if you agree have a drink with me\n\nRaise you glasses for a toast\n\n\n\nTo a little bit of chicken fried\n\nCold beer on a Friday night\n\nA pair of jeans that fit just right\n\nAnd the radio up\n\nWell I`ve seen the sunrise\n\nSee the love in my woman`s eyes\n\nFeel the touch of a precious child\n\nAnd know a mother`s love\n\n\n\nI thank God for my life\n\nAnd for the stars and stripes\n\nMay freedom forever fly, let it ring\n\nSalute the ones who died\n\nAnd the ones that give their lives, so we don`t have to sacrifice\n\nAll the things we love\n\n\n\nLike our chicken fried\n\nCold beer on a Friday night\n\nA pair of jeans that fit just right\n\nAnd the radio up\n\nWell I`ve seen the sunrise\n\nSee the love in my woman`s eyes\n\nFeel the touch of a precious child\n\nAnd know a mother`s love\n\n\n\nGet ya little chicken fried\n\nCold beer on a Friday night\n\nA pair of jeans that fit just right\n\nAnd the radio up\n\nWell I`ve seen the sunrise\n\nSee the love in my woman`s eyes\n\nFeel the touch of a precious child\n\nAnd know a mother`s love\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to april1182 and bropeen for correcting these lyrics)"
