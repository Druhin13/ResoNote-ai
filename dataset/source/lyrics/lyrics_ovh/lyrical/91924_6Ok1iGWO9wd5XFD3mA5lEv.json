  "lyrics": "Something worthwhile\r\nSomething unsaid\r\nSomething I needed after you left\r\nAnd I don't recognise my face anymore\r\nI got lost without you\r\nWhile I was running on the high, high\n\nI felt like I was wasting time, time\n\n\n\nKeep falling on a loaded gun\n\nTryna be someone for you\n\nFeeling like the only one\n\nTryna find my way to you\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nKeep falling on a loaded gun\n\nTryna be someone for you\n\nFeeling like the only one\n\nTryna find my way to you\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\n\n\nGot my reward after the show\n\nWhen I'm all rising, you let me go\n\nI'm putting on a smile these days\n\nGive 'em when I nearly break\n\nI've been walking a wrong way\n\nFeel like I am wasting time\n\nThe faces I don't recognize\n\n\n\nKeep falling on a loaded gun\n\nTryna be someone for you\n\nFeeling like the only one\n\nTryna find my way to you\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\n\n\nKeep falling on a loaded gun\n\nTryna be someone for you\n\nFeeling like the only one\n\nTryna find my way\n\n\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nKeep falling on a loaded gun\n\nTryna be someone for you\n\nFeeling like the only one\n\nTryna find my way to you\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?\n\nDo you remember me like I remember you?"
