  "lyrics": "Your mind is in touch now, baby\r\nOr losing hard in a broken world\r\nIt's like an imaginary girl\r\nIt shimmers you in your dream then leaves you cold\r\nAll my life, a place to return to\r\nSomething to hold on\n\nAsking you now\n\nDo you still remember\n\n\n\nAll of those moments you gave me shelter\n\nOut of the swelter, out of the sun\n\nInto an ocean, under the high tide\n\nHowling by your side\n\nUntil the morning comes\n\nUntil the morning comes\n\n\n\nI want to your untie your tongue, girl\n\nI want your love to send me right\n\nI got myself in a world of trouble\n\nAnd I canâ€™t run so I guess I'll fight\n\nFor your love, the one thing I return to\n\nHolding so tight, I'll put it to you now\n\nFor you consideration\n\n\n\nAll of those moments you gave me shelter\n\nOut of the swelter, out of the sun\n\nInto an ocean, under the high tide\n\nHowling by your side\n\nUntil the morning comes\n\nUntil the morning comes\n\n\n\nAll through the night\n\nSo long, side by side\n\nOh, and my heart keeps falling\n\nOne more for the ride\n\nSomehow always in time\n\nAnd my heart keeps falling\n\n\n\nAll of those moments you gave me shelter\n\nOut of the swelter, out of the sun\n\nInto an ocean, under the high tide\n\nHowling by your side\n\nUntil the morning comes\n\nUntil the morning comes"
