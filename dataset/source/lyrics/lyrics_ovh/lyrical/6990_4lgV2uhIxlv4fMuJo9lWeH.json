  "lyrics": "The bomb's in the china. The fat's in the fire. \nThere's no turkey left on the table. \nThe commuter's return on the six o'clock flyer \nbrings no bale of hay for the stable. \nWell, the light, it is failing along the green belt \nas we follow the hard road signs. \n\nSemi-detached in our suburban-ness \n\nwe're living in these hard times. \n\nWell the fly's in the milk and the cat's in the stew. \n\nAnother bun in the oven - oh, what to do? \n\nWe'll laugh and we'll sing and try to bring \n\na pound from your pocket. \n\nGood day to you. \n\nOh, these hard times. \n\n\n\nThe politicians sat on the wall \n\nand traded with the union game. \n\nSomeone slapped a writ on our deficit \n\nnot a penny left to our name. \n\nOh, the times are hard and the credits lean, \n\nand they toss and they turn in sleep. \n\nAnd the line they take is the line they make \n\nbut it's not the line they keep. \n\n\n\nThe cow jumped over yesterday's moon \n\nand the lock ran away with the key. \n\nYou know what you like, and you like what you know \n\nbut there is no jam for tea. \n\nWell the light it is failing along the green belt \n\nas we follow the hard road signs. \n\nSemi-detached in our suburban-ness \n\nwe're living in these hard times."
