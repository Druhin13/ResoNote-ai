  "lyrics": "Sun sun sun burn down on me\r\nAtop this hill so I can see\r\nMy skin boils red and scabs and stings\r\nBut I must be witness to everything\r\nFan the fire or face the crowd\r\nCalifornia’s burning down\n\nSitting in the middle of the sixth extinction\n\nSilently suggesting the investment in a generator\n\n\n\nI called you up because I thought you’d see it my way\n\nI looked for freedom and I found it on the highway\n\nNo other options so I’m peeling out the driveway\n\nSing those brand new ABCs\n\n\n\nABC 123 LMNO\n\nABC 123 LMNO\n\nABC 123 LMNO\n\nABCDEFG\n\n\n\nI want so badly to be liked\n\nI ask myself, “Why was I nice?”\n\nI ask myself, “What should I do?”\n\nBut all I know is white centrality\n\nMy country served me horror coke\n\nMy natural freedom up in smoke\n\nMy pre-polluted fetus lead us\n\nInto the obscene, I mean\n\nI’m on a desert island and I ate up all the coral\n\nI was so hungry but I know that isn’t normal, oh no\n\nBut my behavior isn’t anything but moral\n\nSo unhappy! (ABC!)\n\nI called you up because we had a great connection\n\nYou couldn’t hear me ‘cause of NSA protection\n\nBut we’ll unite before the very next election\n\nNo abstentions! VOTE\n\nThe ABCs\n\n\n\nABCDEFG\n\n\n\nI called you up because I’d like to see it your way\n\nThe bridge between us is behind a different doorway\n\nThought I was looking but I don’t know what to see\n\nLiving in the new reality\n\nA desert island and I ate up all the coral\n\nI was so hungry but I know that isn’t normal\n\nBut my behavior isn’t anything but moral\n\nABCDEFGH\n\n\n\nABC 123 LMNO\n\nABC 123 LMNO\n\nABC 123 LMNO\n\nABC 123 LMNO"
