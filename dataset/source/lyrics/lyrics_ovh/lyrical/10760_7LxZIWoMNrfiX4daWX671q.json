  "lyrics": "If I was a warrior\r\nWhat would be my weapon\r\nForgiveness\r\nLaughter\r\nSound\r\nMy riches sky and ground\n\nLike the smell of pine\n\nIn forests that drip divine\n\nDarkness sublime\n\nIn a blue sky mind\n\nStainless\n\n\n\nTurn the pages of a story of circles\n\nWhere I am that I am\n\nWhere all paths join hands in the lands I remember\n\nWhere I am returned to my sender\n\nFully surrounded I surrender\n\n\n\nWhere the darkness illumines\n\nMy doubts lay in ruin"
