  "lyrics": "Am I afraid of you?\r\nOr do I pretend I don't care?\r\nJust like the stars can tell all the worlds apart\r\nI'll be here in the dark\r\nStayed inside to watch the rain again\r\nI watched all of my movies from the end to the start\n\nAnd I can't help but think about you now when the trailers start\n\n'Cause I know we're worlds apart\n\n\n\nNow I stand here unknown\n\nA voice in the hall\n\nYou're famous for something\n\nIt's hard to recall\n\n\n\nWill anything change?\n\nIt's stuck on replay\n\nOur room is now vacant\n\nThe beds are well made\n\n\n\nDo I exist in your heart?\n\nOr did the ship sail away?\n\nWhile I was in the gift shop\n\nYou swam with the sharks\n\nAnd I know we're worlds apart\n\n\n\nNow I stand here unknown\n\nA voice in the hall\n\nYou're famous for something\n\nIt's hard to recall\n\n\n\nWe don't have a choice\n\nThe curtains have closed\n\nI'm making a point\n\nBut you'll never know\n\nKnow, know, know"
