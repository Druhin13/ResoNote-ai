  "lyrics": "I got nasty habits, I take tea at three \nYes, and the meat I eat for dinner \nMust be hung up for a week \nMy best friend, he shoots water rats \nAnd feeds them to his geese \nDon'cha think there's a place for you \n\nIn between the sheets? \n\n\n\nCome on now, honey \n\nWe can build a home for three \n\nCome on now, honey \n\nDon't you wanna live with me? \n\n\n\nAnd there's a score of harebrained children \n\nThey're all locked in the nursery \n\nThey got earphone heads they got dirty necks \n\nThey're so 20th century \n\nWell they queue up for the bathroom \n\n'Round about 7:35 \n\nDon'cha think we need a woman's touch to make it come alive? \n\n\n\nYou'd look good pram pushing \n\nDown the high street \n\nCome on now, honey \n\nDon't you wanna live with me? \n\n\n\nWhoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear \n\nThe cook she is a whore \n\nYes, the butler has a place for her \n\nBehind the pantry door \n\nThe maid, she's French, she's got no sense \n\nShe's wild for Crazy Horse \n\nAnd when she strips, the chauffeur flips \n\nThe footman's eyes get crossed \n\n\n\nDon'cha think there's a place for us \n\nRight across the street \n\nDon'cha think there's a place for you, \n\nIn between the sheets?"
