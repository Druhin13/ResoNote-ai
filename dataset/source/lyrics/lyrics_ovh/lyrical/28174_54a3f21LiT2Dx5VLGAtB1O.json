  "lyrics": "I've got one fatal flaw:\r\nI'm a compulsive liar\r\nIf I don't love you\r\nI will tell you anything\r\nAnd even if I love you\r\nI'll always be conniving\n\nI'll always be negotiating with the truth\n\n\n\nAnd I can trace the habit\n\nTo when I was eleven\n\nAnd I thought boys were pretty\n\nAnd I couldn't tell no one\n\n\n\nIt opens at a young age:\n\nThat all-protective closet\n\nJust lock the door\n\nAnd settle in among the raincoats\n\nThe longer you stay in there\n\nThe more you'll get distorted\n\nThe more contorted all your lies will have to be\n\n\n\nDon't wait a moment longer:\n\nStand up and turn the doorknob\n\nAnd I'll tell you my secret\n\nIf you will tell me yours"
