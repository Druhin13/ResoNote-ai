  "lyrics": "I need a hit song\r\nA straight to your heart song\r\nMaybe I'm headstrong\r\nBut I need to prove\r\nI need a new mark\n\nA strength through the door spark\n\nI'd hit a home run\n\nIf I only knew\n\n\n\nThe tears run down your cheek\n\nAnd the needle I twist into the groove\n\nThe stage is set for dance\n\nBut the 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' it's awful tune\n\nAnd I know there is still something to prove\n\nHit songs don't always sell the truth\n\n\n\nI need a high note\n\nA moment to clear throats\n\nOf all who have lost hope\n\nIn need of a song\n\n\n\nI need a hard way line\n\nTo get me cross the finishing line\n\nAnd back in those arms of yours\n\nAnd you into mine\n\n\n\nAnd the song pours out your heart\n\nAnd the curtain call is one more for the start\n\nAnd hanging on your every dream\n\nThe hurdy-gurdy once more steals the scene\n\n\n\nAnd I know there is something left to lose\n\nAnd high notes don't always reach the truth\n\nAnd needles don't always meet their groove\n\nAnd hit songs don't always need to move"
