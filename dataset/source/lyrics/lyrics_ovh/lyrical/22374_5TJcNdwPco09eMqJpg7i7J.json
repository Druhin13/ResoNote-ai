  "lyrics": "I was huntin' for white-tail last year down in ol' Mexico\r\nAnd I asked for the best huntin' guide and they gave me Pedro\r\nOn that second mornin' I shot me a big trophy buck\r\nAs we carried him out, soon we were circled by trucks\r\nAnd I didn't know it but this land belonged to the cartel\r\nThey took all our money and threw me and Pedro in jail\n\nNow I'm gonna be guilty 'til proved innocent\n\nNo lawyer to call so we're already dead\n\nBut Pedro sat in the corner with a gleam in his eye\n\nTold me \"We're gonna be alright\"\n\n\n\nWell the jailer he didn't know\n\nPedro was hidin' that old 44\n\nWaitin' for him to walk by\n\nSoon as he did Pedro shot the guard twice\n\nSaid \"I'll get you to America and out of this hell\"\n\n'Cause this ain't my first time escapin' a Mexican jail\n\n\n\nWell we blew off the lock\n\nRan out back to an old pickup truck\n\nIt used to belong to the guard\n\nNow he won't need it much\n\nWe drove to the border\n\nUnder the cover of night\n\nUp a dirt road 50 miles\n\nAnd we cut off the lights\n\nAnd I could see customs just up there ahead\n\nAnd I reached over and I shook Pedro's hand\n\nHe said \"I'll disappear for a while\n\nOn that wide open range\"\n\nWhat a true friend, maybe even a saint\n\n\n\nYeah the jailer he didn't know\n\nPedro was hidin' that old 44\n\nWaitin' for him to walk by\n\nSoon as he did Pedro shot the guard twice\n\nSaid \"I'll get you to America and out of this hell\"\n\n'Cause this ain't my first time escapin' a Mexican jail\n\n\n\nWell I airdropped a brief case last week in ol' Mexico\n\nFull of 10,000 dollars and airfare to Texas for Pedro"
