  "lyrics": "A troubled mind in search\r\nOf a bright neon bay\r\nI swim to shore\r\nThe only route to take\r\nIs perfection itself\r\nThe stars lead the way\n\n\n\nAs waves make oceans complete\n\nFate is the shell of my beat\n\nO how I feel all that I need\n\nUnder my thoughts under my fears\n\n\n\nLittle things I know they're real\n\n\n\nThey make my soul complete\n\n\n\nLittle things and all they bring\n\nAre fragments bitter sweet\n\n\n\nLittle things not everything\n\nCoz glitter is no goal\n\nSimple things are all I need\n\na friend to guide to hold\n\n\n\nIf you should go\n\n(Go now)\n\n\n\nI find myself alone\n\nWith no center no home\n\nBut I won't close my eyes\n\nThe thing I love the most\n\nI'm letting you go\n\nBut I won't give up hope"
