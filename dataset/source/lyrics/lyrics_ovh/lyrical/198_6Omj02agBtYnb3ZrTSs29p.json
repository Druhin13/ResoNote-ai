  "lyrics": "I don't know what to do with myself\r\nFriday night there's a handle on the shelf\r\nI could use a hand, I could use some help\r\nLord knows I've been going through hell\r\nMight step outside, catch a breath of fresh air\r\nOr I might just drop to the middle of nowhere\n\nDo a little soul searching, little moonlight churching\n\n\n\n'Cause my world's gone numb and I just wanna feel something\n\nRunning [?] but I don't know if I can overcome it\n\n\n\nI ain't drunk and I ain't stoned\n\nJust been wondering all night long\n\nThey say the sun's still gonna dawn\n\nBut baby you're good and gone\n\nSo right now I don't see how life goes on\n\nHow life goes on\n\n\n\nUsed to be on a Friday night\n\nBaby you and me [?] under neon lights\n\nSmell the smoke all over our clothes\n\nWe hang around till the whole town closed\n\nNow every bar I pass makes my heart head south\n\nEvery drink I have leaves a bad taste in my mouth\n\nAnd baby that's why\n\n\n\nI ain't drunk and I ain't stoned\n\nJust been wondering all night long\n\nThey say the sun's still gonna dawn\n\nBut baby you're good and gone\n\nSo right now I don't see how life goes on\n\nHow life goes on\n\nCome on!\n\n\n\nTell me life goes on\n\n\n\nBaby how do you make leaving me look so easy\n\nYeah I'm trying so hard but I'm so far from believing\n\nThat life goes on\n\nYeah life goes on\n\n\n\nI ain't drunk and I ain't stoned\n\nJust been wondering all night long\n\nThey say the sun's still gonna dawn\n\nBut baby you're good and gone\n\nSo right now I don't see how life goes on\n\n\n\n'Cause I ain't drunk and I ain't stoned\n\nJust been wondering all night long, yeah\n\nYes and the sun's still gonna dawn\n\nBut baby you're good and gone\n\nSo right now I don't see how life goes on\n\nYeah life goes on\n\nTell me life goes on\n\nYeah life goes on"
