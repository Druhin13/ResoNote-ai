  "lyrics": "Maybe it's 'cause your mom never kissed you\r\nIf you ever cried you'd wipe with muscle tissue\r\nYou bench pressing more than me's not the issue\r\nI know you're actually weaker than that\r\nLet's open up and get deeper than that\n\nLike why, why are you only vulnerable when no one's around?\n\nYour gym membership is not a crown\n\n\n\nYou're not so tough\n\nI know that nightlight's on when you sleep\n\nYou're not so tough\n\nYeah, you watch Eat Pray Love on repeat\n\nAnd I'm sure you'd win in an altercation\n\nBut you're still insecure to me\n\nOh, so mess me up\n\nI know you're not so tough\n\n\n\nAre you insecure that the steroids are causing hair-loss?\n\nThat your Lulu shorts don't quite vibe with your camo AirPods\n\nAnd if I ran into you passed sunset, I'd probably be scared off\n\nBut I know you're honestly weaker than that\n\nI bet you know that you need to relax\n\n\n\nAnd I don't mean to come at you like it's Watergate\n\nMy pale, ghostly body's purely water weight\n\nYeah, I should probably substitute what is on my plate\n\nBut I still acknowledge those feelings inside\n\nLet's work on your habit to run or to hide\n\n\n\nLike why, why are you only vulnerable when no one's around?\n\nYour gym membership is not a crown\n\n\n\nYou're not so tough\n\nI know that nightlight's on when you sleep\n\nYou're not so tough\n\nYeah, you watch Eat Pray Love on repeat\n\nAnd I'm sure you'd win in an altercation\n\nBut you're still insecure to me\n\nOh, so mess me up\n\nI know you're not so tough\n\n\n\nYou're not so tough... you're not\n\nYou're not so tough... you're not\n\nYou're not so tough... you're not\n\nYou're not so tough... you're not\n\n\n\nYou're not so tough\n\nI know that nightlight's on when you sleep\n\nYou're not so tough\n\nYeah, you watch Eat Pray Love on repeat\n\nAnd I'm sure you'd win in an altercation\n\nBut you're still insecure to me\n\nOh, so mess me up\n\nI know you're not so tough"
