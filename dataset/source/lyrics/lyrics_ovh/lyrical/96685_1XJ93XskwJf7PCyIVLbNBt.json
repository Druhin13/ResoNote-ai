  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Anxiety par Julia Michaels\r\nMy friends, they wanna take me to the movies\nI tell them that I'm far from holding hands with my depression\nAnd right when I think I’ve overcome it\nAnxiety starts kicking in to teach us a lesson\nOh, I try my best just to be social\nI make all these plans with friends, and hope they call and cancel\nThen I overthink about the things I'm missing\nNow I'm wishing\nI was with them\n\nFeel like I’m always apologising for feeling\nLike I'm out of my mind\nWhen I'm doing just fine\nBut my exes all say that I'm hard to deal with\n\nAnd I admit, I admit\nHey\n\nBut all my friends, they don't know\nWhat it's like, what it's like\nThey don't understand why\nI can’t sleep through the night\nI’ve been told that I could take something to fix it\nDamn, I wish it I wish it was that simple, ah\nBut all my friends, they don't know\nWhat it’s like \n\nI've always wanted to be one of those people in the room that\nsays something and everyone puts their hand up\nLike, if you're sad put your hand up\nIf you hate someone, put your hand up\n\nAnd if you're scared, put your hand up\nFeel like I’m always apologizing for feeling\nLike I'm out of my mind\nWhen I'm doing just fine\nBut my exes all say that I'm hard to deal with\nAnd I admit it, and I admit\nOh\n\nFeel like I’m always apologising for feeling\nLike I'm out of my mind\nWhen I'm doing just fine\nBut my exes all say that I'm hard to deal with\nAnd I admit, I admit\nHey\n\nBut all my friends, they don't know\nWhat it's like, what it's like\nThey don't understand why I can't sleep through the night\n\nI've been told that I could take something to fix it\nDamn, I wish it I wish it was that simple, ah\nBut all my friends, they don't know\nWhat it's like\n\nI have all these thoughts\nRunning through my mind\nAll the damn time\nAnd I can't seem to shut it off I think I'm doing fine\nMost of the time I say that I'm alright\nBut I can't seem to shut it off I have all these thoughts\nRunning through my mind\nAll the damn time\nAnd I can't seem to shut it off I think I'm doing fine\n\nMost of the time I say that I'm alright\nBut I can't seem to shut it off\nShut it off, hey\n\nBut\nAll my friends, they don't know\nWhat it's like, what it's like\nThey don't understand why I can't sleep through the night\nAnd I thought that I could take something to fix it\nDamn, I wish it I wish it was that simple, ah\nBut all my friends, they don't know\nWhat it's like, what it's like (Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey)\nWhat it's like, what it's like (Ah, ah, ah, ah, hey)\nWhat it's like, what it's like"
