  "lyrics": "I can't go for a ride to clear my head\r\n'Cause everything I pass puts you back in it\r\nYeah, we're done, moving on\r\nBut you can't be too far gone\r\n'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\nEvery back road we've ever gone down\n\nFriday night bleachers, Sunday pews\n\nAin't a county line mile without a memory of you\n\nEvery whisper, every room I walk in\n\nEvery time the bartender fills it up again\n\nEverybody knows why I'm here\n\nAnd you ain't around\n\n\n\n'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\n\n\nOh, we said this goodbye was the last\n\nI guess I could leave, I could run from the past\n\nAnd from us, and from you\n\nBut this is where I belong, this is my home too\n\n\n\nWhat happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\nEvery back road we've ever gone down\n\nFriday night bleachers, Sunday pews\n\nAin't a county line mile without a memory of you\n\nEvery whisper, every room I walk in\n\nEvery time the bartender fills it up again\n\nEverybody knows why I'm here\n\nAnd you ain't around\n\n\n\n'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\n\n\nAnd I'm still here\n\nAnd every time I see that little white Jeep\n\nYeah, that hand-me-down Ford pulling down your street\n\nI wonder if somebody's in my seat\n\nIf you're moving on, or you're stuck like me?\n\n\n\n'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\nOh yeah\n\n\n\nWhat happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\nEvery back road we've ever gone down\n\nFriday night bleachers, Sunday pews\n\nAin't a county line mile without a memory of you\n\nEvery whisper, every room I walk in\n\nEvery time the bartender fills it up again\n\nEverybody knows why I'm here\n\nAnd you ain't around (you ain't around)\n\n\n\n'Cause what happens in a small town stays in a small town\n\nStays in a small town\n\nStays in a small town\n\nNow I'm still here\n\n(What happens in a small town)\n\nI'm still here\n\n(Stays in a small town)\n\nI'm still here\n\nYeah I'm still here\n\nI'm still here"
