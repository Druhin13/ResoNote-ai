  "lyrics": "Whoa-oh-oh\r\nCome down from the mountain, you have been gone too long\r\nThe spring is upon us, follow my only song\r\nSettle down with me by the fire of my yearning\r\nYou should come back home, back on your own now\n\n\n\nThe world is alive now, in and outside our home\n\nYou run through the forest, settle before the sun\n\nDarling, I can barely remember you beside me\n\nYou should come back home, back on your own now\n\n\n\nIn the evening light, when the woman of the woods came by\n\nTo give to you the word of the old man\n\nIn the morning tide, when the sparrow and the seagull fly\n\nAnd Johnathan and Evelyn get tired\n\n\n\nLie to me if you will at the top of Beringer Hill\n\nTell me anything you want, any old lie will do\n\nCall me back to you\n\n\n\nBack to you"
