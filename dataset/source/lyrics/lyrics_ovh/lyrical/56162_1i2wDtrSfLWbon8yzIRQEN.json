  "lyrics": "All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut\r\nBefore the so-called life got in the way\r\nEight miles high, I turn the light switch on\r\nAnd laugh at all the games I used to play\r\nBut I had a dream when I was seven\n\nSecret door at the back of heaven\n\nI woke up the second I walked in\n\n\n\nAnd over time the dream got old and faded\n\nAnd everything just gets so complicated\n\n\n\nI watched them send the rocket up in Florida\n\nAnd everybody cheered and waved goodbye\n\nI imagined it was me up in the captains chair\n\nLeaving laws of gravity behind\n\n\n\nNow the weight is heavy on my shoulders\n\nNine to five, I'm getting older\n\nTruth be told, it really ain't that bad\n\n\n\nAnd over time the dream got old and faded\n\nAnd everything just gets so complicated\n\n\n\nWell all I ever wanted to be was an astronaut\n\nI guess it's a little late for that right now\n\nAnd I get up every morning just to punch the clock\n\nAnd take the number 80 bus 'cross town\n\n\n\nWell I try my best not to regret it\n\nMost of the time I just forget it\n\nMaybe another place, some other time\n\nCause after all the dream got old and faded\n\nAnd everything just gets so complicated\n\nBut all I ever wanted to be was an astronaut"
