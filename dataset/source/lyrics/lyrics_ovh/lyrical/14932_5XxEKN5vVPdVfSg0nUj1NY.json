  "lyrics": "I've spent my life trying to be\r\nA solar light\r\nIn the darkest sea\r\nWearing my shield\r\nFor the final fight\r\nI won't back down\n\nI won't bend a knee\n\n\n\nYea though I walk through\n\nThe Valley of the shadow\n\nOf Death\n\nI fear no evil, no evil\n\n\n\nI look back\n\nUpon my life and know\n\nI've gone far\n\nBut have a long way to go\n\nI've done things\n\nThat only others dream\n\nA miracle\n\nOr so at least it seems\n\n\n\nYea though I walk through\n\nThe Valley of the shadow\n\nOf Death\n\nI fear no evil, no evil"
