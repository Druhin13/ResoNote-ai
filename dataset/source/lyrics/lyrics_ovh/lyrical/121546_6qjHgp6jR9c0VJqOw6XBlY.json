  "lyrics": "Never spoken with my mouth full\r\nYeah that's a mouthful and I'm doubtful\r\nThat I could get these lyrics out, oh\r\n'Cause I think fast but I sing slow\r\nIf I ever started rapping\r\nThey'd be laughing, they won't believe me\n\nBut I got so much I wanna say, so\n\nI'm thinking rappers, they got it easy\n\n\n\nSomeone told me to be selfless\n\nBut we are helpless without attention\n\nSo if no one's paying attention\n\nThen does my voice get to your headphones\n\nYou start thinking about the clock ticks\n\nYou get nervous, you start stressing\n\nSo how am I supposed to fit this\n\nIn three minutes and thirty seconds\n\n\n\nListen to my aching heart\n\nQuick, before you skip the song\n\nWe are human after all\n\nAnd we don't stay for long\n\n\n\nSomeone told me to be selfless\n\nBut we are helpless without attention\n\nWealthy people learned their lesson\n\nAnd never donate without the press there\n\nYou wanna skip it if it's wordy\n\nBut fit the whole song in three-thirty\n\nI thought I had the ADHD\n\nBut that's a real thing and I'm just lazy\n\n\n\nListen to my aching heart\n\nQuick, before you skip the song\n\nWe are human after all\n\nAnd we don't stay for long\n\n\n\nWe are human after all\n\nAnd we don't stay for long\n\n\n\nListen to my aching heart\n\nWill you keep this record on\n\nIf Ed Sheeran writes my song\n\nI'll finally top the charts\n\n\n\nIf Ed Sheeran writes my song\n\nI'll finally top the charts"
