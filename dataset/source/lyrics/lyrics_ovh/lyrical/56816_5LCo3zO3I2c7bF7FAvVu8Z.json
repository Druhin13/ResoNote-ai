  "lyrics": "Tick tock I'm on the clock\r\nAnd I'm feeling like this job is a 9 to 5'ing my life away\r\nIt's like I'm back in school\r\nAnd I'm in the last class\r\nAnd I'm passing time until the bell rang\r\nHaving visions of summertime\n\nBut wait a minute, this is later tonight\n\nTrying to make some tailgating song\n\nUp in the moonlight and by the way\n\nIt's payday\n\n\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\nPull it up, have the time of your life\n\nTake a shot for the regret\n\nDouble up and it's bound\n\nTo get double wild\n\nHey ladies let your hair down\n\nWe know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah\n\nDo your thing like it's spring break\n\nWake and bake and we at it again\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\n\n\nBackwoods looking like Panama City\n\nBunch of jacked-up trucks and bikinis\n\nGot a yeti full of good ideas\n\nAin't worried about driving gonna stay right here\n\n\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\nPull it up, have the time of your life\n\nTake a shot for the regret\n\nDouble up and it's bound\n\nTo get double wild\n\nHey ladies let your hair down\n\nWe know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah\n\nDo your thing like it's spring break\n\nWake and bake and we at it again\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\n\n\nSomebody said somethin' 'bout church on Sunday, Amen\n\nSomebody said somethin' 'bout work on Monday,\n\nDon't say it again\n\n\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\nPull it up, have the time of your life\n\nTake a shot for the regret\n\nDouble up and it's bound\n\nTo get double wild\n\nHey ladies let your hair down\n\nWe know ain't nobody scared now, hell nah\n\nDo your thing like it's spring break\n\nWake and bake and we at it again\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\n\n\nLive it up\n\nLive it up for the weekend, c'mon\n\nLive it up\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\nLive it up\n\nLive it up for the weekend\n\nLive it up\n\nLive it up for the weekend"
