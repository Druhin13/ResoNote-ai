  "lyrics": "Every time I fall, I'm a little less me and a little bit more you\r\nAnd everywhere I go, there's a little less there and a little bit more to lose\r\nDid you ever wonder why?\r\nI can't decide if I'm a little bit dead or a little bit guarded\r\nCause even when I try, you and I are a little less there and just discarded\n\nIf we collapse\n\nUnder all the weight\n\nOf our self-importance\n\nWhat if it's too late\n\n\n\nI threw it all away\n\nIt doesn't make it better\n\nWhy am I the ostracized?\n\nMaybe I can change\n\nIf I put it back together\n\nIf I'm right then I don't want to know\n\n\n\nEven if I could, I'll never be free from a little bit more than this\n\nIt won't do any good, any other way is a little bit more to risk\n\nBut I say \"Fuck it, risk it!\"\n\n\n\nIf we collapse\n\nOnly time will tell\n\nObey the same disorders\n\nAnd ride your ass to hell\n\n\n\nI threw it all away\n\nIt doesn't make it better\n\nWhy am I the ostracized?\n\nMaybe I can change\n\nIf I put it back together\n\nIf I'm right then I don't want to know\n\n\n\nI threw it all away\n\nIt doesn't make it better\n\nWhy am I the ostracized?\n\nMaybe I can change\n\nIf I put it back together\n\nIf I'm right then I don't want to know\n\nThen I don't want to know\n\nI don't want to know\n\nKnow, know, know"
