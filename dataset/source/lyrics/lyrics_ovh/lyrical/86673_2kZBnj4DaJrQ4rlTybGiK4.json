  "lyrics": "We're so dark by night, I am lost\r\ndirections getting faded\r\nremember what you're taught\r\nshe's so bright, i'll use her as light\r\nshe's so much more than decoration \n\n\nShe can fly, and shes no angel in the sky\n\nshe's a witch but she knows better not to take me when she flys \n\nand i miss how she looks me in the eyes\n\noh this sounds like desperation\n\n\n\nif you're a bird then i'm a bird\n\nbut if you cant fly then neither will i\n\ncause then love is not the right time, to die\n\n\n\nher wings are spread, \n\nshe's stuck here on the ground\n\nshe's not heavy, she's my world\n\ni'll carry her around\n\ni hear her breathing, that's my favorite sound\n\n\n\nif you're a bird then i'm a bird\n\nbut if you cant fly then neither will i\n\ncause then love is not the right time to die\n\nwe still have our whole life to be with you and im done \n\nand make this life a good one"
