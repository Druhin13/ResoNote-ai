  "lyrics": "They said \"sleep is for the weak\"\r\nAnd i gave into the mantra\r\nThe scene was derelict;\r\nThe facebook propaganda\r\nMy router is a candle\r\nThat ignites my slim innocence\n\nAnd i see how this was so dull\n\nBut i liked the blue brittleness of the night time\n\n\n\nCurious camgirls\n\nCruel and kind cherry boys\n\nThey were restless for those refills\n\nSuperimposed on a green screen\n\nYour aimless web surfing\n\nAnd arranged brain battling\n\nI just wanted to be our crew\n\nSitting like a clot in my brain\n\nIn the night time"
