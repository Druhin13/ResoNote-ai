  "lyrics": "Look to the sky and face the sun\r\nYou better try to race against the gun\r\nThere's nothing left for you to prove\r\nYou get a chance then now's the time to move\r\nNothing to rival\n\nThis heavy load\n\nPray for survival\n\nEnd of the road\n\n\n\nYou're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower\n\nSealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower\n\n\n\nNo remedy so be afraid\n\nIt's cutting deep just like the razor blade\n\nNo escape, you're in a spell\n\nDon't you believe you stand a chance in hell\n\n\n\nRays of redemption\n\nFall from the sky\n\nInto the maelstrom\n\nBlink of an eye\n\n\n\nYou're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower\n\nSealing your fate, annihilate by the flame thrower\n\n\n\nImmolate the bodies\n\nNo one will be saved\n\nConsecrate with fire\n\nAshes fill the grave\n\n\n\nLook to the sky and face the sun\n\nYou better try to race against the gun\n\nThere's no escape, you're in a spell\n\nDon't you believe you stand a chance in hell\n\n\n\nNothing to rival\n\nThis heavy load\n\nPray for survival\n\nEnd of the road\n\n\n\nYou're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower\n\nSealing your fate, terminate by the flame thrower\n\n\n\nFlame thrower\n\nFlame thrower\n\nFlame thrower\n\nFlame thrower"
