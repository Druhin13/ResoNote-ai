  "lyrics": "I left my mother feelin' sick in a bedroom\r\nMy daddy told me, \"Son, you best grow up\"\r\nI told my friends, they could find me on the internet\r\n'Cause somehow this place just ain't enough\r\nCollect call from a brother in the lock up\r\nHe said he paid his dues but could I pay them too\n\nMy best friend is stealin' money from my pocket\n\nI guess it's time to go, and they said\n\n\n\n\"Who, who are you?\" \"Who are you really anymore?\"\n\nI said, \"Who, who am I, I don't know what I'm heading for\"\n\nI said, \"All I know, all I know, I'm leaving again\"\n\nI said, \"Goodbye, so long\", to my, my neighborhood\n\nAnd I know, I know, I'll see you again\n\n'Cause I'll always, always come back\n\nTo my neighborhood, to my neighborhood\n\n\n\nI threw my troubles and my bags in the back seat\n\nPulled up the drive, for one last look\n\nShe was standin' in the doorway lonely, after leanin' in close\n\nShe said, \"Who, who are you?\" \"Who are you really anymore?\"\n\nI said, \"Who, who am I, I don't know what I'm fighting for\"\n\n\n\nAll I know, all I know, I'm leaving again\n\nI said, \"Goodbye, so long\", to my, my neighborhood\n\nAnd I know, I know I'll see you again\n\n'Cause I'll always, always come back\n\nTo my neighborhood, to my neighborhood, to my neighborhood\n\n\n\nCame back last night just to see you\n\nIt's been too long but nothing's change\n\nI'm trying to be the one that you can't be\n\nBaby these dreams they all to blame\n\nI can hear it in your voice that you do know\n\nIt's not a choice for me to stay\n\nSo long, goodbye to the neighborhood\n\nTo my neighborhood\n\n\n\nAll I know, all I know, I'm leaving again\n\nI said, \"Goodbye, so long\", to my, my neighborhood\n\nAnd I know, I know I'll see you again\n\n'Cause I'll always, always come back\n\nTo my neighborhood, my neighborhood, my neighborhood, my neighborhood"
