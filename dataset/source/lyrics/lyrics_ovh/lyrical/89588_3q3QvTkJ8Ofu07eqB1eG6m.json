Head lice, dressed like a douchebag\n\nUnsaid prayers, undead raccoon hat\n\nVoice of the boiled-over\n\nThick skull; still throw his toys out his stroller\n\nPiss black roof tar, bleed flat Cherry Coke\n\nVery much another wack-job with a megaphone\n\nVery much another fat slob playing chess alone\n\nLesser-known fetish porn, leftover Lexapro, et cetera\n\nEverything's coming up goose eggs\n\nSunday, Monday, Happy Days, Tuesday is Tuesday\n\n\n\nTuesday\n\nTuesday"
