  "lyrics": "Headed out to California\r\nGone west to see the sun\r\nThere's a fortune here if you got time, but I’ve found mine\r\nBuried in the golden hair she spun\r\nSailin' off to search the islands\r\nGone west for somethin' new\n\nFound paniolo and wave riders, but chose neither\n\nPicked the sweetest sugar cane they grew\n\n\n\nI’ve gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed\n\nI've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea\n\nTook a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah\n\nI've gone west to bring the best back with me\n\nI've gone west to bring the best back with me\n\n\n\nI chased the light to Amarillo\n\nWhere the wild horses run\n\nCaught a painted-angel moonrise, kinda spitfire\n\nLike a bullet from a smokin' gun\n\nGoin' back to mama's homeland\n\nPlayin’ in the field of dreams\n\nI was lookin’ where the corn grows and the skies glow\n\nAnd I found your beauty in between\n\n\n\nI've gone west, rollin’ down the highway like a tumbleweed\n\nI've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea\n\nTook a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah\n\nI've gone west to bring the best back with me\n\nI've gone west to bring the best back with me\n\n\n\nAnd I follow the fadin’ light\n\n'Til the stars are my map at night\n\nAnd if you come to get me and my house is empty\n\nIt's safe to guess I've gone west\n\n\n\nI've gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed\n\nI've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea\n\nTook a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah\n\nI've gone west to bring the best back with me\n\nI've gone west to bring the best back with me"
