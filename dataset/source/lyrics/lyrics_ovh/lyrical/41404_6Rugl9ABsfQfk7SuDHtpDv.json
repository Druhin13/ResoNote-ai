  "lyrics": "Born with a scar far above my head\r\nI count the stars crowding my vision\r\nAnd I feel nothing instead\r\nI feel nothing instead\r\nSoak in decay, spoil into loam\n\nGive what I take but it never feels enough\n\nSo I give nothing instead\n\nI give nothing instead\n\n\n\nTake me to the water\n\nI am not free but I am sorry, I am stone\n\nYou should know I would never let you down\n\nYou should know I would never let you drown\n\n\n\nLoan by the skin, a vessel with two hands\n\nTouch what I can before I hand it in\n\nSo I touch nothing instead\n\nI touch nothing instead\n\n\n\nBorn into debt, a line of no request\n\nPay what I can but the rest, I have no chance\n\nSo I pay nothing instead\n\nI pay nothing instead\n\n\n\nTake me to the water\n\nI am not free but I am sorry, I am stone\n\nYou should know I would never let you down\n\nYou should know I would never let you drown\n\n\n\nTake me to the water\n\nLet me soak in slaughter\n\nI will sink into the bed like a stone\n\nTake me to the water\n\nLet me soak in slaughter\n\nI will sink into the bed like a stone\n\n\n\nTake me to the water\n\nI am not free but I am sorry, I am stone\n\nYou should know I would never let you down\n\nYou should know I would never let you down\n\nYou should know I would never let you down\n\nYou should know I would never let you drown"
