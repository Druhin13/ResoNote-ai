  "lyrics": "I've not learned how to draw\r\nWhat if you die with all of the cameras?\r\n\r\nTake something and then make it brand new\r\nTry and do anything fourteen times\n\nLove yourself like someone you love\n\nDon’t take any of my advice\n\nWrite a letter to your future self who won’t change\n\nDon’t let the internet ruin your time\n\nThey can take anything as long as it’s true\n\nWhat they can’t take is you telling them lies"
