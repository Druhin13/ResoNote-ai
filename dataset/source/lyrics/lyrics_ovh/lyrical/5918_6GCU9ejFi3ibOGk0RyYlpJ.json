  "lyrics": "Laid in my room to reflect my mood\r\nFacing my feelings with a life without you\r\nOrange and yellow\r\nDoesn’t matter what’s the use\r\nWhenever i see him, there are shades of blue\n\nStaring at walls when I’m feeling down\n\nStaying indoors cause you're not around\n\n? and violet\n\nDoesn’t matter, what’s the use?\n\nWhenever i see him, there are shades of blue\n\nShades of blue\n\n\n\nChoosing a color for my particular point of view\n\nKidding myself, there are shades of blue\n\nWhenever i see him oh shades of blue"
