  "lyrics": "Oh, darling\r\nPick you up just to let you drop\r\nWe got started, I was guarded\r\nI almost forgot about you\r\nIt was charming\r\nThe way we danced around the truth\n\nYou were smiling, always hiding\n\nAnd then I feel we're somehow quickly, slowing\n\n\n\nThought I was healthy but I'm choking\n\nIt must be catching up my smoking\n\nI wish that I never played\n\n\n\nYou're standing out in the rain, tonight\n\nLike you got something to say, to God\n\nAnd you got a debt to pay back\n\nFor something you did way back\n\n\n\nYou're standing out in the rain, tonight\n\nLike you got something to say, to God\n\nAnd you got a debt to pay back\n\nFor something you did way back\n\nYou wanna make it okay\n\n\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\nSpilling up some of my guts\n\nOne day you're fine, next you're crying\n\nSuddenly your engine just stops going\n\n\n\nThought you were healthy but you're choking\n\nIt must be catching up your smoking\n\nI wish that you never played\n\n\n\nYou're standing out in the rain, tonight\n\nI give us something to say, to God\n\nAnd you got a debt to pay back\n\nFor something you did way back\n\n\n\nYou're standing out in the rain, tonight\n\nI give us something to say, to God\n\nAnd you got a debt to pay back\n\nFor something you did way back\n\nYou wanna make it okay\n\n\n\nYou're standing out in the rain, tonight\n\nI give us something to say, to God\n\nAnd he's got a debt to pay back\n\nFor something he did way back\n\n\n\nYou're standing out in the rain, tonight\n\nI give us something to say, to God\n\nAnd you got a debt to pay back\n\nFor something you did way back\n\nYou wanna make it okay"
