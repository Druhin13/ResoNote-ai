  "lyrics": "Mama, I fell in love with a criminal\r\nPoint-blank range stole my heart in Union Square\r\nMama, you told me love was a miracle\r\nSo why do I keep feeling like nobody cares?\r\nIt's the only thing I know\n\nFighting through the cold to find ya\n\nLooking for your light\n\nThe shadows always hide the truth\n\nLighting up the coals\n\nHope you see the smoke of my fire\n\nIn a world filled of ghosts I can only see the soul in you\n\n\n\nI've been trying find my way in the city\n\nI don't even know myself anymore\n\nBut if I'm sure of one thing, I need you with me\n\nEven if half the time we're at war\n\nBut that's just the way it goes\n\nThat's just the way it goes\n\nEither way it goes\n\n\n\nFather told me one day by the river\n\nYou'll find glory and hurt within the flow\n\nThere's a pain here but it don't last forever\n\nGotta let it tear away your heart so it can grow\n\n\n\nIt's the only thing I know\n\nFighting through the cold to find ya\n\nLooking for your light\n\nThe shadows always hide the truth\n\nLighting up the coals\n\nHope you see the smoke of my fire\n\nIn a world filled of ghosts I can only see the soul in you\n\n\n\nI've been trying find my way in the city\n\nI don't even know myself anymore\n\nBut if I'm sure of one thing, I need you with me\n\nEven if half the time we're at war\n\nBut that's just the way it goes\n\nThat's just the way it goes\n\nEither way it goes"
