  "lyrics": "The river shows no mercy\r\nThe tower looms into my view\r\nI sense my execution's closing\r\nWith darkness all around me\r\nThe axe is ground to end my days\r\nThe raven's cry proclaims repentance\n\n\n\nOut of the dark\n\nInto the light\n\nLeaving my mark\n\nFree from the traitors gate\n\nInto the storm\n\nI'm gonna win\n\nKiller of sin\n\nSaved by the traitors gate\n\n\n\nA man betrayed for treason\n\nI only wanted what was right\n\nTo bring a purpose by rebellion\n\nThe storm is soon arriving\n\nAnd rain will wash away my blood\n\nThis walk of death will bring survival\n\n\n\nOut of the dark\n\nInto the light\n\nLeaving my mark\n\nFree from the traitors gate\n\nReady to die\n\nCarry the day\n\nBury the lie\n\nTear down the traitors gate\n\n\n\nForgive me for my sins\n\nI meant no harm to you\n\nSo let the axe man fall\n\nTo justify what I begin\n\n\n\nWhere will you be tomorrow\n\nNow they've removed this mortal coil\n\nI hope and pray I bring you freedom\n\nFor honour God and country\n\nThis world can be a better place\n\nAs I ascend from my conviction\n\n\n\nOut of the dark\n\nInto the light\n\nLeaving my mark\n\nFree from the traitors gate\n\nRiver of blood\n\nTurning the tide\n\nCause of the flood\n\nDestroying the traitors gate\n\n\n\nOut of the dark\n\nInto the light\n\nLeaving my mark\n\nFree from the traitors gate\n\nLosing my head\n\nBlunt of the axe\n\nAlive when I'm dead\n\nEscape from the traitors gate"
