  "lyrics": "I wrote a song called \"The Longing Is All\"\r\nInstead of calling you I'd hoped it would solve me\r\nFor now I go to where the reeds grow tall\r\nFall flat and small then they'll never find me\r\nAnd when it swells on me\n\nI'll crash into it and push a little closer\n\nYea when it swells on me\n\n\n\nOn raft, chasing dusk at the edge of night\n\nPaddling for land, hand on heart and heart in hand\n\nStart again, George Washington\n\n\n\nAnd when it swells on me\n\nI'll crash into it and push a little closer\n\nYea when it swells on me\n\n\n\nWe're already there\n\nWe're already there\n\nWe're already there\n\nWe're already there\n\nWe're already there\n\nA new love blooms on the long notes of old horns"
