  "lyrics": "There's a life outside I didn't know\r\nTied up, falling down to this empty soul\r\nAnd lord knows that this love has taken toll\r\nI've given all of my love to this broken home\r\nSo why don't you lose yourself for me\n\nWhy don't you lose yourself for me\n\nWhat is it that your eyes don't see\n\nWhy don't you lose yourself for me\n\nWhy don't you lose yourself, for me\n\n\n\nIt won't work if it don't make sense at all\n\nI'm so lost that I can't see through the fall\n\nThe same stains that were left from the cherry whine\n\nThe same stains that I wish we could both rewind\n\n\n\nDid you notice that the feeling ain't happy no more\n\nDid you notice it's the feeling you've been running from\n\nYou wouldn't notice if your eyes ain't falleing for me\n\nDid you open up my heart, did you take it from me\n\n\n\nSo why don't you lose yourself for me\n\nWhy don't you lose yourself for me\n\nWhat is it that your eyes don't see\n\nWhy don't you lose yourself for me\n\nSo why don't you lose yourself for me\n\nWhy don't you lose yourself for me\n\n\n\nYou lose yourself from playing games\n\nLose yourself, it ain't the same\n\nYou lose yourself from playing games\n\nYou lose yourself, it ain't the same"
