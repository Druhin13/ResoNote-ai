  "lyrics": "She's gettin' older, you'd think that she'd be farther\r\nIf she were smarter\r\nShe'd turn the car around\r\nShe won't admit it, but when the tough gets harder\r\nShe's her mother's daughter\r\nShe's gonna let you down\n\n\n\nRun away little Dixieland\n\nGone away is the steady hand\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is a promise that nobody can keep\n\nFly away little Delta Rose\n\nShe finds love where'er she goes\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is the biggest lie she'll ever believe\n\n\n\nWhen she was younger she was more like her father\n\nFaithful and stronger\n\nShe was the light in his eyes\n\nAnd she'll deny it, but now that he's no longer\n\nShe's her mother's daughter\n\nUntil the day she dies\n\n\n\nRun away little Dixieland\n\nGone away is the steady hand\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is a promise that nobody can keep\n\nFly away little Delta Rose\n\nShe finds love where'er she goes\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is the biggest lie she'll ever believe\n\n\n\nRun away little Dixieland\n\nGone away is the steady hand\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is a promise that nobody can keep\n\nFly away little Delta Rose\n\nShe finds love where'er she goes\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is the biggest lie she'll ever believe\n\n\"Stayin' forever\" is the biggest lie she'll ever believe"
