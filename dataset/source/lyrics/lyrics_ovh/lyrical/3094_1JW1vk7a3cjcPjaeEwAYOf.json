  "lyrics": "Too much to dream, feeling temporary\r\nThe thought is fucking scary, I fight the voices chanting Jerry, Jerry\r\nIf they don't want me to make it, I'll make it legendary\r\nIf they just want you to fake it, they ain't a visionary\r\nSo let me keep it very very extraordinary\r\nI'll bring the heat, with the flow colder than February\n\nHit up to your path that carry one and then I'm Tyler Perry, now excuse me while I put this beat in the obituary\n\nBitch you worry gone, as good is gone\n\nWake up at dawn\n\nOne day I fucked with mourn, like they need it after bomb\n\nIf they tell me I'm the shit that they want it all along\n\nWould I still feel like the king, and the bishop, and the pawn?\n\n\n\nBut while they been sleeping, I've been scheming, I've been building rocket ships to put my team\n\nAnd start the countdown cause we're leaving\n\nEverybody take your seats, Hi this is your captain speakin'\n\n\"timeflies\"\n\nStay woke and stay dreamin'\n\n\n\nIs it too much\n\nIs it too much\n\nIf it's too much to dream\n\nIs it too much\n\nIs it too much\n\nIf it's too much to dream\n\n\n\nOh what I time to be alive\n\nEverybody pick a side, toe the line, read the vibes, read the room, read the signs\n\nRead the energy and tides\n\nFeel the people posting for pennies, power, pussy, and pride\n\nCan we just be easy, are you down on me\n\nMake a scene at the crossroads through the fire\n\nOh, is it all a little bit too much\n\n\n\nTo dream"
