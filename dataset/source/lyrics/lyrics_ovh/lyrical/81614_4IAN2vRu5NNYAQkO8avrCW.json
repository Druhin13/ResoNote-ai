  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Bittersweet & Blue par Above & Beyond\r\nI've got a photograph of you\nKept in a box of memories\nAnd when I feel breakable\nI take it out\nAnd look into your eyes\nHoping you'd tell me what do to\nGive me some guidance\nAlways unshakeable\nYour voice was strong, and beautiful and wise\n\nLook at the cloudless day\nYou captured me smiling\nA fantasy life, you say\nIs our silver lining\n\nThis is your life, dreams can come true\n\nBut like your memories of me\nThey'll be bittersweet and blue\nThis is your life, dreams can come true\nBut like your memories of me\nThey'll be bittersweet and blue\n\nBittersweet and blue\nBittersweet and blue\nOh, oh\nBittersweet and blue\n\nMaybe I left it late to say\nYou were my hero\nRising the falling sun\nWhistling Elvis, striding through the snow\nThe thought of a weekend far away\nLasting forever\nBut when the day had come\n\nThe final bell concealed a body blow\n\nLook at me now, you'd say\nDrowning in sorrow\nI guess I got lost today\nBut there's always tomorrow\n\nThis is your life, dreams can come true\nBut like your memories of me\nThey'll be bittersweet and blue\nThis is your life, dreams can come true\nBut like your memories of me\nThey'll be bittersweet and blue\n\nBittersweet and blue\nBittersweet and blue\nThis is your life\nBittersweet and blue\n\n\nThis is your life, dreams can come true\nBut like your memories of me\nThey'll be bittersweet and blue\nThis is your life, dreams can come true\nBut like your memories of me\nThey'll be bittersweet and blue\n\nBittersweet and blue\nBittersweet and blue\nOh, oh\nBittersweet and blue"
