  "lyrics": "You only hear what you want\r\nYou only hear what you want\r\nKnock me down\r\nI'm not sure I have it in me to get back up\n\nTo be who I am seems exhausting anyway\n\nYou have a lot in common with my conscience\n\nYou both erase my confidence\n\n\n\nI can't leave you\n\nYou can't leave me\n\nWe've been stuck in here forever\n\nIf I disappear, if I disappear\n\nI can't see you, you can't see me\n\nWe'll be lost in here together\n\nIf I disappear would you notice I'm not here\n\n\n\nBack and forth\n\nBetween some kind of vague attachment to yesterday\n\nAnd never knowing what form of myself I'll get today (to get today)\n\nI'll always be a faded sign in your eyes\n\nNo matter what the point of view (point of view)\n\n\n\nI can't leave you\n\nYou can't leave me\n\nWe've been stuck in here forever\n\nIf I disappear, if I disappear\n\nI can't see you, you can't see me\n\nWe'll be lost in here together\n\nIf I disappear would you notice I'm not here\n\n\n\nI'm not here\n\nYou only hear what you want\n\nYou only hear what you want to hear\n\n\n\nI can't leave you\n\nYou can't leave me\n\nWe've been stuck in here forever\n\nIf I disappear, if I disappear\n\nI can't see you, you can't see me\n\nWe'll be lost in here together\n\nIf I disappear would you notice I'm not here\n\nWould you notice I'm not here"
