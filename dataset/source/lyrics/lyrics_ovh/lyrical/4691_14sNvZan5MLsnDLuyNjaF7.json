  "lyrics": "It was never jealousy, just a cute hyperbole, idiocracy\r\nI dream\r\nAnd he's still keen to chill with me, I've zoomed in 1080p\r\nYour pseudo-smile is so unfree\r\nAll this stealing keeps me going, just recalling, you and me\n\nAnd there's something, so affecting, in the reflections, on my screen\n\n\n\nThis is a portfolio, the chat log's loading way too slow\n\nYour good girl lingerie shows\n\nAnd she's still keen to chill with me, ditched on her master's degree\n\nWhat a drag your life must be...\n\n\n\nAll this howling...\n\nAll this bawling...\n\n\n\nIt makes me feel alive\n\nSat in bed lit by the light\n\nOf a silly gif playing on repeat"
