  "lyrics": "I was so quiet\r\nBut you were excited\r\nWaiting for romance\r\nSomeone contacted me\r\nLonely out on the street\r\nThere is a need to feel safe\n\nHow did we get to this place?\n\nRise on my back, I'll set to attack\n\nI've come to take your hair\n\n\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on, hold on\n\n\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nDon't know what to do with you\n\n\n\nI was so quiet\n\nBut you were excited\n\nWaiting for the dance\n\nThey all just waltzed in\n\nA second behind me\n\nI stood there like some dumb kid\n\nThe music played and the boys would take you\n\nFar from where I was\n\nI was still hoping that you were the victory\n\nTo what I felt like love\n\n\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on, hold on\n\n\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nDon't know what to do\n\nDon't know what to do with you\n\n\n\nHold on\n\nHold on\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on, hold on"
