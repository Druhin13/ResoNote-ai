  "lyrics": "The whole world's spinning in the wrong direction\r\nBody and soul needs a resurrection\r\nAin't had a single thing go my way\r\nAnd I can't tell ya how many days\r\nI need blue water, I need a sunny day\n\nBlue water, sail all my cares away\n\nHead out to see when the tide rolls in\n\nFeel like a brand new man again\n\nI need blue\n\nGonna drown my troubles in blue water\n\n\n\nRolled all the way through Arizona\n\nThought I found the answer in Sedona\n\nThis desert's gettin' old to me\n\nI need a little bit of that deep blue sea\n\n\n\nI need blue water, I need a sunny day\n\nBlue water, sail all my cares away\n\nHead out to see when the tide rolls in\n\nFeel like a brand new man again\n\nI need blue\n\nGonna drown my troubles in blue water\n\n\n\nI drove right though the heart of Texas\n\nMiles and miles of empty stretches\n\nParked out by the lake near Santa Fe\n\nStarted thinkin' 'bout Aransas Bay\n\n\n\nI need blue water\n\nGonna drown my troubles in blue water\n\n\n\nI need the motion of the ocean\n\nThat's the only magic potion\n\n\n\nBlue water, I need a sunny day\n\nBlue water, sail all my cares away\n\nHead out to see when the tide rolls in\n\nFeel like a brand new man again\n\nI need blue\n\nGonna drown my troubles in blue water\n\n\n\nGonna drown my troubles in blue\n\nGonna drown my troubles in blue water\n\nPick out a sunny day\n\nBlue\n\nDrown my troubles in blue water\n\nDrown my troubles in blue water"
