  "lyrics": "No hope, slow dreams\r\nI'm unsatisfied\r\nShow me the antidote\r\nRestless mornings\r\nDreading twenty-five â€˜fore adi-adios\n\nAnd oh, I never need nobody\n\nNeed nobody, no\n\nAnd oh you know I don't care\n\nIf I don't know where to go\n\n\n\nWe only get a hundred years to get even higher\n\n'Cause thunder loves fire\n\nWe only get a hundred years\n\nSo I'm gonna ride this quarter life crisis\n\n\n\nBreak ups, heart breaks\n\nHead is spinning round just like a merry go\n\nNew age sinners\n\nJustify our lives 'till we turn into ghosts\n\n\n\nAnd oh, I never need nobody\n\nNeed nobody, no\n\nAnd oh you know I don't care\n\nIf I don't know where to go\n\n\n\nWe only get a hundred years to get even higher\n\n'Cause thunder loves fire\n\nWe only get a hundred years\n\nSo I'm gonna ride this quarter life crisis\n\n\n\nSay whatcha say, we ain't got no time\n\nBut we got plenty of it\n\nRun then we run straight through the night\n\nSay whatcha say, we ain't got no time\n\nBut we got plenty of it\n\nRun then we run straight through the night\n\n\n\nWe only get a hundred years to get even higher\n\n'Cause thunder loves fire\n\nWe only get a hundred years\n\nSo I'm gonna ride this quarter life crisis\n\n\n\nWe only get a hundred years to get even higher\n\n'Cause thunder loves fire\n\nWe only get a hundred years\n\nSo I'm gonna ride this quarter life crisis"
