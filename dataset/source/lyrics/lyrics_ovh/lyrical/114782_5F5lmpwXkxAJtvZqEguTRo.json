  "lyrics": "You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store\r\nIf you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more\r\nEven if you lose it, it will find you\r\nThere's no way to stop it, but they'll try to\n\nRunning like a river trying to find the ocean\n\nFlowers in the concrete\n\nClimbing over fences, blooming in the shadows\n\nPlaces that you can't see\n\nComing through the melody when the night bird sings\n\nLove is a wild thing\n\n\n\nOh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips\n\nAnd I can hear it in the words coming off your lips\n\n\n\nEven if you lose me, I will find you\n\nThere's no way to stop it, so don't try to\n\n\n\nRunning like a river trying to find the ocean\n\nFlowers in the concrete\n\nClimbing over fences, blooming in the shadows\n\nPlaces that you can't see\n\nComing through the melody when the night bird sings\n\nLove is a wild thing\n\n\n\nI used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark\n\nBut not anymore, anymore, no\n\n\n\nRunning like a river trying to find the ocean\n\nFlowers in the concrete\n\nClimbing over fences blooming in the shadows\n\nPlaces that you can't see\n\nComing through the melody when the night bird sings\n\nLove is a wild thing\n\nLove is a wild thing\n\nLove is a wild thing, yeah"
