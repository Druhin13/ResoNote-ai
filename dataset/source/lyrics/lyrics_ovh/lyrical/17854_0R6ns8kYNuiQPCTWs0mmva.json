  "lyrics": "I've looked in your eyes\r\nAt least a thousand times\r\nI know everything about you\r\nEvery inch, every smile\r\nMaybe it's the stars\r\nOr maybe it's this bar\n\nBaby I wanna remember\n\nHow it felt to fall for your heart\n\n\n\nSo right now, how about maybe\n\nI don't know you, you don't know me\n\n\n\nLet's be strangers tonight\n\nLeave our memories behind\n\nKiss me like we've never kissed\n\nAnd hold me like you're scared to death\n\nPretend that it's the very first time\n\nLet's be strangers, let's be strangers\n\n\n\nI wanna not know what you're thinking\n\nI wanna say something stupid\n\nGet lost, parked in my car\n\nTurn the fire back in a spark\n\n\n\nSo right now, how about maybe\n\nI don't know you, you don't know me\n\n\n\nLet's be strangers tonight\n\nLeave our memories behind\n\nKiss me like we've never kissed\n\nAnd hold me like you're scared to death\n\nPretend that it's the very first time\n\nLet's be strangers, let's be strangers\n\n\n\nI never wanna get used to you\n\nI wanna hang on every word, every thing you do\n\nI wanna dance with you, I wanna dance with you\n\nLike we're strangers, like we're strangers\n\nLike we're strangers, oh oh\n\n\n\nLet's be strangers tonight\n\nLeave our memories behind\n\nKiss me like we've never kissed\n\nAnd hold me like you're scared to death\n\nPretend that it's the very first time\n\nLet's be strangers, let's be strangers, let's be strangers\n\nLet's be strangers, let's be strangers\n\nLet's be strangers tonight"
