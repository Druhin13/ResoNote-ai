  "lyrics": "My words come out like an avalanche in silence\r\nAnd you've got oceans trapped in your eyelids\r\nThey tell me that no man is an island\r\nBut it feels like it's a storm that I've been fighting\r\nAnd I used to listen to the radio\n\nBut I've got an army of voices in my head\n\nVoices in my head\n\nAnd we used to live in stereo\n\nBut I've got an army of voices in my head\n\nVoices in my head\n\n\n\nHow come the friends and the foes invisible\n\nAre the ones that made my soul most miserable?\n\nHead's reeling from the feeling\n\nIn my mind but I feel it in the physical\n\nWhy's the sunlight hiding?\n\nAin't letting any light in\n\nIt's a storm that I've been fighting\n\n\n\nAnd I used to listen to the radio\n\nBut I've got an army of voices in my head\n\nVoices in my head\n\nAnd we used to live in stereo\n\nBut I've got an army of voices in my head\n\nVoices in my head\n\n\n\nAnd they're singing\n\nI got voices, I got voices\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nYeah, I got voices, I got voices\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nEvery moment crowded with choices\n\nSpeak to me and drown out the voices\n\n\n\nAnd I used to listen to the radio\n\nBut I've got an army of voices in my head\n\nVoices in my head (voices in my head)\n\nAnd we used to live in stereo\n\nBut I've got an army of voices in my head\n\nVoices in my head\n\nVoices!"
