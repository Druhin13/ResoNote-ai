  "lyrics": "Sparks Will Fly\r\nYou'd better grease up \nI'm coming back \nYou're going to catch fire \n\nPyromaniac \n\nYou'd better shape up \n\nYou'd better get set \n\nI'm gonna burn up \n\nIn the smoke of a jet \n\n\n\nSparks will fly \n\nWhen I finally get myself back on you, baby \n\nSparks will fly \n\nWhen I finally get myself back to you baby \n\nYou're going to find out \n\nGoing to scream and shout \n\nWe're going to pierce through this drought \n\nSparks will fly, sparks will fly \n\n\n\nYou'd better stand back \n\nThe flames are high \n\nBetter get help \n\nCan't stop the fire \n\nBell's going to ring \n\nHear the alarms \n\nBetter tell the fire chief \n\nTo quit playing cards \n\n\n\nSparks will fly \n\nWhen I finally get myself back on you, baby \n\nSparks will fly \n\nWhen I finally get myself back on you, baby \n\nI'm gonna step on the gas \n\nI want to get there really fast \n\nI want to fuck your sweet ass \n\nSparks will fly \n\nSharks will cry \n\nSparks will fly \n\n\n\nI had a good sniff around \n\nAlong old hunting grounds \n\nBut I have never found \n\nA woman so hot \n\n\n\nSparks will fly \n\nWhen I finally get myself back on you, baby \n\nSparks will fly \n\nWhen I finally get myself back to you, baby \n\nMy fingers are crossed \n\nThe time that we lost \n\nI'm in total chaos \n\nSparks will fly \n\nSparks will fly \n\nSparks will fly"
