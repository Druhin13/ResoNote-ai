  "lyrics": "I see you flashing that vicious grin again. I hear the tick-tock-tick of your bomb. You want another innocent statistic in your sadistic little hard-on. I know you’re crawling out your hole for another round and spitting out your hate like napalm. I won’t be the collateral damage. You want an enemy, you got one. I won’t be a feather in your storm. I’ll be the rage. I’ll be the war. War! Shackle yourself to getting off on vengeance, while preaching to me about your freedom. Shouting of peace, but never losing rhythm to the beat of your war drum. Huff! Puff! Blow your bitter wind. Bring about your pissing rain. I’ll be the thorn in your flesh. I’ll be the blistering pain. I won’t be a feather in your storm. I’ll be the rage. I’ll be the war. War! I won’t be a feather in your storm. I’ll be the rage. I’ll be the war. I won’t be a feather in your storm. I’ll be the rage. That’s your one warning."
