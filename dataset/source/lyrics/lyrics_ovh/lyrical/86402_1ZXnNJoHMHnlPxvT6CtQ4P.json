  "lyrics": "I am the author of my life.\r\nAnd I'm writing in pen, and I can't rub out my mistakes.\r\nIf I could start again in life, I would repeat all my mistakes.\r\nThey make us who we are in this world.\r\nMaking changes everyday, but it seems so empty,\n\nI try so hard, but I am only a man.\n\nHow much longer can my brow damn these beads of sweat\n\nbefore they sting my eyes?\n\nLike time has shown me, so many times before.\n\nHow much longer can my will last me throughout this lifetime?\n\nI struggle to find who I am anymore.\n\n\n\nI know now that who I am is better than who I used to be.\n\nIf this is all I am, then so be it, this is all I can be.\n\nI know now that who I am is better than who I used to be.\n\nIf this is all I am, then so be it, this is all I can be.\n\nAll I can be.\n\n\n\nI am the author of my life.\n\nAnd I'm writing in pen, and I can't rub out my mistakes.\n\n\n\nThere are many things that aren't what they seem in this world,\n\nFriendship is the best example of these.\n\nI find myself questioning more and more every single day.\n\nHow much longer can we hold our brothers to these flames?\n\nAnd the people who have meant so much to us?\n\n\n\nI know now that who I am is better than who I used to be.\n\nIf this is all I am, then so be it, this is all I can be.\n\nI know now that who I am is better than who I used to be.\n\nIf this is all I am, then so be it, this is all I can be"
