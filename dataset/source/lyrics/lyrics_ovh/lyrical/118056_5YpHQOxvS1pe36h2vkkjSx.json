  "lyrics": "Hey hey hey hey, \"Hammer to Fall\"!\r\nHere we stand or here we fall\r\nHistory don't care at all\r\nMake the bed, light the light\r\nLady Mercy won’t be home tonight\n\n\n\nYou don't waste no time at all\n\nDon't hear the bell, but you answer the call\n\nIt comes to you as to us all, yeah\n\nAnd it’s time for the hammer to fall\n\n\n\nEvery night, and every day\n\nA little piece of you is falling away\n\nBut lift your face, the Western Way\n\nBuild up...\n\n\n\nTow your line and play their game\n\n'Til the anesthetic covers it all\n\n'Til one day they call your name\n\nThen it's time for the hammer to fall\n\n\n\nRich or poor or famous\n\nFor your truth is all the same (Oh no, oh no)\n\nLock your door 'cause rain is pouring\n\nThrough your window pane (Oh no)\n\nBaby, now your struggle's all in vain, oh, yeah\n\n\n\nFor we who grew up tall and proud\n\nIn the shadow of the mushroom cloud\n\nConvinced our voices can't be heard\n\nJust wanna scream it louder and louder and louder\n\n\n\nWhat the hell are we fighting for?\n\nJust surrender and it won't hurt at all\n\nJust got time to say your prayers\n\nThen it’s time for the hammer to, hammer to fall\n\n\n\nIt’s going to fall!\n\n\n\nHey, yeah\n\nHey, yeah\n\nHey, yeah\n\nOne more time\n\nWaiting for the hammer to fall\n\n\n\nGive it to me one more time!"
