  "lyrics": "I'm asleep on pile of paper\r\nIdeas are rife but never amount to much\r\nThey died in a cardboard building\r\nLicking cuts, I count the ways I'm not quite living\r\nNo boom no bust, gold bars of love\r\nNot quite floating, not quite sinking\n\nGive me the drink\n\nI'm the future king, I'm a future king\n\nI'm the future Back on the peace? exist somewhere but can't be seen\n\n\n\nThese words are meant for nothing\n\nHope is born of hopelessness\n\nThese thoughts won't change the clocks\n\nNotes on a Life Not Quite Lived\n\n\n\nAn appalling teacher, lessons learned\n\nLost in a deep abyss\n\nThe voice gets weaker and weaker still\n\nWere we really born for this\n\nI'm sort of feeling a kind of maybe\n\nType of thing, please dismiss\n\nThis public speaker, the future king\n\nThe future king, the future falls to its knees\n\nIt exists somewhere but can't be seen\n\n\n\nThese words are meant for nothing\n\nHope is born of hopelessness\n\nThese thoughts won't change the clocks\n\nNotes on a Life Not Quite Lived\n\n\n\nThese words won't shatter the earth\n\nHope is born of hopelessness\n\nThese thoughts won't change the clocks\n\nNotes on a Life Not Quite Lived"
