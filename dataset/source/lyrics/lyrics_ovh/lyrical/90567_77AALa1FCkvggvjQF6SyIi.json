  "lyrics": "As I was goin' over the Cork and Kerry mountains\r\nI saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin'\r\nI first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier\r\nI said stand o'er and deliver or the devil he may take ya\r\nMusha ring dumb a do dumb a da\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nThere's whiskey in the jar-o\n\n\n\nI took all of his money and it was a pretty penny\n\nI took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly\n\nShe swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me\n\nBut the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy\n\n\n\nMusha ring dumb a do dumb a da\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nThere's whiskey in the jar-o\n\n\n\nBeing drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber\n\nTakin' my money with me and I never knew the danger\n\nFor about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell\n\nI jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels\n\n\n\nMusha ring dumb a do dumb a da\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nThere's whiskey in the jar-o\n\n\n\nNow some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'\n\nAnd some men like ta hear a cannon ball a roarin'\n\nMe? I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber\n\nBut here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah\n\n\n\nOh, musha ring dumb a do dumb a da\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nThere's whiskey in the jar-o\n\n\n\nMusha ring dumb a do dumb a da\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nWhack for my daddy-o\n\nThere's whiskey in the jar-o"
