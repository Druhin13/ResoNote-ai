  "lyrics": "Dear insecurity\r\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\r\nWhen you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am\r\nOh, insecurity\r\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\r\nWhen you ever gonna let me be just the way I am\n\nDear insecurity\n\n\n\nI hate the way you make me feel\n\nI hate the things you make me think\n\nYou make me sick to my stomach\n\nI wish that I wasn't me\n\nSomedays when I wake up, I see myself in the mirror\n\nI feel like we shouldn't be good and be clearer\n\nMy nose to my clothes from my chin to my skin\n\nI'll never be good, enough forever again\n\nFor you, so I'd change for you\n\nThen I'll die for you, then you made me blue\n\nIf I were you, I'd hate me too\n\nBut I already feel like you do\n\nBecause you tell me I'm not worth shit\n\nAnd the bad luck's on purpose\n\nAnd if I'm sad, then I deserved it\n\nBut underneath the surface\n\nI'm hurting, searching, and learning\n\nMy imperfections maybe perfect\n\n\n\nDear insecurity\n\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\n\nWhen you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am\n\nOh, insecurity\n\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\n\nWhen you ever gonna let me be just the way I am\n\nDear insecurity\n\n\n\nI, feel like I'm dying on the inside\n\nBut I smile it off\n\nI'm a mess, I'm depressed, I'm alone and it's all my fault\n\nDid I do something wrong? This feeling's unfair\n\nYou're making me anxious but why the fuck do I care?\n\nI overthink everything till' my thoughts are impaired\n\nI hate everything about me, I think I need some air\n\nDrink some water, take a breath\n\nTake a moment to be thankful for the reasons that you're blessed\n\nIt's not about mistakes you made or failures that you had\n\nIt's all about the memories and little things you have\n\nYou freckles, and flawsty\n\nYour body ambruises\n\nYour scar is til' your beautiful, birth marks that truth hides\n\nWe're on in the same to play the cards that you doubt\n\nNobody likes you more than you being yourself\n\n\n\nDear insecurity\n\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\n\nWhen you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am\n\nOh, insecurity\n\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\n\nWhen you gonna let me be just the way I am\n\nDear insecurity\n\n\n\nI am\n\nProud of the person of I am\n\nNobody's gon' tell me who I am\n\nOr who I can't be\n\nI am\n\nTaking my life into my hand\n\nSo tired of hiding who I am\n\nI am me\n\nSo\n\n\n\nDear insecurity\n\nWhen you gonna take your hands off me?\n\nWhen you ever gonna let me be proud of who I am\n\nOh, insecurity\n\nIt's time to take your hands off me?\n\nIt's the time to let you see\n\nJust the way I am\n\nI'm proud of who I am"
