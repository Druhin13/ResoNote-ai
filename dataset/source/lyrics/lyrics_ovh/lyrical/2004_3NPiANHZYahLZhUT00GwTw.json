  "lyrics": "Carriage on the sink\r\nLike a case of red wine\r\nGet drunk on the pity\r\nTill you offer your hand\r\nA certain revelation\n\nAnd the road's a ruin\n\nAnd you knew it all along\n\nIt's the man I really am\n\n\n\nI did what you asked of me, baby\n\nAnd I try try tried to pretend that I was better\n\nBut there's only so much I can do\n\nWhen you cry cry cry in the night\n\nWhen the four winds blow (oooh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen the four winds blow (oooh-oh)\n\n\n\nWalking in a daze on a saint's old bones\n\nWe don't know where we're going\n\nBut it's pretty enough\n\nSo far away from home\n\nBut my doors are open\n\nI can show you where to go\n\nIf you let me know where you are\n\n\n\nI did what you asked of me, baby\n\nAnd I try try tried to pretend that I was better\n\nBut there's only so much I can do\n\nWhen you cry cry cry in the night\n\nWhen the four winds blow (oooh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen the four winds blow (oooh-oh)\n\n\n\nTried to write a letter\n\nBut I couldn't find the words\n\nSo I tossed and I turned\n\nTrying to figure it out\n\nDidn't see it then\n\nWith the postcard views\n\nBut you cried with the wind\n\n'cause you knew it'll blow me down\n\n\n\nI did what you asked of me, baby\n\nAnd I try try tried to pretend that I was better\n\nBut there's only so much I can do\n\nWhen you cry cry cry in the night\n\nWhen the four winds blow (oooh-oh)\n\n\n\nWhen the four winds blow (oooh-oh)"
