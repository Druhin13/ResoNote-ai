  "lyrics": "My dragon skin was torn off (was torn off)\nNow my blood is thickening up\nAnd I am longing to be free\nOnly you can save me (save me)\nOnly you can save me\n\n\nThere's so many different religions, I don't have the time\n\nto name them\n\nIs each one a different road that is made from the same\n\npavement?\n\nDoes every road out there go to the same destination?\n\nDoes every religion offer us the same salvation?\n\nCan mankind make an image of a God and be convinced\n\nThat the God they imagine in their mind is a God that\n\nexists?\n\nBut if God made man, how can man make a God and make a\n\nclaim?\n\nThat God is confined to fit within a frame\n\nHow can mankind decide how God should be identified?\n\nCan you alter the truth if you accept or deny?\n\nDo the stars disappear when the blind look at the sky?\n\nOr do they simply fail to see what was there the whole time?\n\nIs this flesh all we have, is life over when we die?\n\nIs this rotting body all that we got? Is there a soul\n\ninside?\n\nIs there no absolutes in this life, no truth?\n\nNo wrong, no right, no dark, no light, NOOO!\n\nIf God is love, why does he allow the hatred?\n\nIf he wiped out the wicked the whole earth would be vacant\n\nHe is our breathe of life but our sin suffocated and\n\nseparated\n\nThis necessitated resuscitation for spiritual respiration\n\nand reconciliation\n\nTo recognize our desperation for restoration\n\nFrom the devastation of sins domination who can save us?\n\nTo God alone belongs salvation\n\n\n\nLocked in to so many self incarcerated cages\n\nSwallowed the keys to our future freedom from past ages\n\nPersuaded and traded a King for crowns, evil invaded\n\nAnd predicated a situation of insolence toward his eminence\n\nAs much as we try to conceal it there's really no\n\nrestraining\n\nThe penance for pursuing profane pleasure is payment\n\nAnd death is what its wages is, It kill but its contagious\n\nWe lust because who love it, He's just but just jaded\n\nSo it seems hopeless when we focus on the consequence\n\nCriminals continue killing conscience and common sense\n\nremaining obstinate\n\nSo we play it low, die slow, and face the arraignment\n\nWe plead \"No contest\" in contempt for no containment\n\nNo pardon for guilty parties cause no person is perfect\n\nSo God in the second person of the trinity permanently\n\npurchases\n\nWith a perfect purpose and a death of an infinite worth\n\nRaising from the earth to assert certain prophetic words\n\nServing as legal substitution to completely reverse the\n\ncurse\n\n\n\nOnly you can save me\n\nOnly you can save me\n\nOnly you can carry me away\n\nOnly you can breathe the life in me\n\nOnly you can save me (only you can save)\n\nOnly you can save me (only you can save me)"
