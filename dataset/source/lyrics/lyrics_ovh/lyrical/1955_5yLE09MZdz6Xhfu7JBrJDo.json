  "lyrics": "Small town, bright lights, Saturday night,\r\nPinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.\r\nMaking change behind the counter in a penny arcade\r\nSat the fat girl daughter of Virginia and Ray\r\n(Spoken:) \n\nLydia\n\nLydia hid her thoughts like a cat\n\nBehind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.\n\nShe read romance magazines up in her room\n\nAnd felt just like Sunday on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nBut dreaming just comes natural\n\nLike the first breath from a baby,\n\nLike sunshine feeding daisies,\n\nLike the love hidden deep in your heart.\n\n\n\nBunk beds, shaved heads, Saturday night,\n\nA warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.\n\nStaring through the ceiling, just wanting to be\n\nLay one of too many, a young PFC:\n\n\n\n(Spoken:) \n\nDonald\n\nThere were spaces between Donald and whatever he said.\n\nStrangers had forced him to live in his head.\n\nHe envisioned the details of romantic scenes\n\nAfter midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nHot love, cold love, no love at all.\n\nA portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.\n\nNothing is wrong, nothing is right.\n\nDonald and Lydia made love that night.\n\n\n\n(Spoken:) \n\nLove\n\nThe made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,\n\nThey made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.\n\nBut when they were finished there was nothing to say,\n\n'Cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:"
