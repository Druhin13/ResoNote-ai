  "lyrics": "I'm lingering on when they kiss\r\nLeaning towards this abyss\r\nAnd of lately the only people I can stare\r\nAre the unraveled ones with their hands laying bare\r\nBut their hands are numb and empty\r\nTheir dull silence soothes me\n\nLoud whispers in my back as if I couldn't hear\n\nThought I left ghosts behind but they're just coming near\n\n\n\nIt doesn't matter, does it\n\nIf I know any exit\n\nIf I believe in god and if god does exist\n\n\n\nRage as a fabric, through and through\n\nLike that gaze used to do\n\n'Cause those suicidal thoughts that are still in my head\n\nGives her that awful side-smile when I lay in bed\n\n\n\nIt doesn't matter, does it\n\nIf I know any exit\n\nIf I believe in god and if god does exist\n\n\n\nShe's barely feeding, but she'll deny\n\nRibbon-legged, she passes by\n\nUntil she surrenders in the midst of the street\n\nAnd the guys simply stare but continue to eat\n\n\n\nIt doesn't matter, does it\n\nIf I know any exit\n\nIf I believe in god and if god does exist\n\n\n\nAnd if I'm cast out 'cause I wanted some more\n\nAnd if this guy dances too close to the shore\n\nAnd if I could just push this door chalked on the wall\n\nAnd if after the void there's somewhere else to fall\n\n\n\nForget I said it\n\nI soliloquize\n\nIt's stinging nettle\n\nTheir hands on their thighs\n\n\n\nRun if you stole a shard of sunlight\n\nDon't ever tell them, I've got your back\n\nChoking to tears with shards of sunlight\n\nRun if you stole a shard of sunlight\n\n\n\nSave all you can\n\nYou won't be found\n\nAnd never come back !"
