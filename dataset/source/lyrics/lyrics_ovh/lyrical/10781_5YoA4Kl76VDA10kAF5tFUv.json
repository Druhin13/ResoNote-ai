Hey!\n\n\n\nI want candy\n\nI want candy\n\n\n\nGo to see her when the sun goes down\n\nThere ain't no finer girl in town\n\nYou're, my girl, what the doctor ordered\n\nSo sweet she make my mouth water\n\n\n\nI want candy\n\nI want candy\n\nBoom! Hey!\n\n\n\nI want candy\n\nI want candy\n\n\n\nCandy on the beach, there's nothing better\n\nBut I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater\n\nSomeday soon I'll make you mine\n\nThen I'll have candy all the time\n\n\n\nI want candy\n\nI want candy\n\nBoom! Hey!\n\n\n\nI want candy\n\nI want candy\n\n\n\nI want candy\n\nI want candy"
