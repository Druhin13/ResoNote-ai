  "lyrics": "When you grow up your heart dies\r\nJust keep holding that secret code by your side\r\nSomebody call, somebody call it\r\nDon’t let it go, don’t let it go\r\nWithout somebody to hold, without somebody\n\nI just need that body\n\n\n\nYou’re on fire\n\nThe way you dance with the devil tonight\n\nYou’re on fire\n\nYou got that last dance look in your eyes\n\n\n\nJust like a movie\n\nDon’t let your heart die\n\nDon’t let your heart die\n\nDon’t let your heart die\n\n\n\nHey temptation escape with me\n\nJust some flashing lights and some tyre smoke is all that we need\n\n\n\nSomebody call, somebody call it\n\nDon’t let it go, don’t let it go\n\nWithout somebody to hold, without somebody\n\nI just need that body\n\n\n\nYou’re on fire\n\nThe way you dance with the devil tonight\n\nYou’re on fire\n\nYou got that last dance look in your eyes\n\n\n\nJust like a movie\n\nDon’t let your heart die\n\nDon’t let your heart die\n\nDon’t let your heart die\n\n\n\nYou’re on fire\n\nJust like a movie\n\nA suicide of a perfect mind\n\nPromise, don’t let your heart die\n\n\n\nKeep running on\n\nJust hold on\n\nJust fight on\n\nUntil the sun goes down\n\nJust remember when you grow up your heart dies"
