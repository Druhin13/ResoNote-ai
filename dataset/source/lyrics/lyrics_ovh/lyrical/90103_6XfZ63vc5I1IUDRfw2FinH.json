  "lyrics": "I was lost in the light, I was blind but now I can see it\r\nI was caught in the web of a lie that I was defeatd\r\nWell, it's hard for a heart to restart but I need to reset it\r\nNot a way to erase what I've done but I need to forget it\r\nBut the beautiful thing that you do\n\nIs making new things out of ruins\n\n\n\nAll of the things I've been through\n\nYou put 'em in the rear view\n\nEverything that you hold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\nYou hold the doors wide open\n\nThere's nothing your love leaves broken\n\nEverything that you hold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\n\n\nThere were times that I tried to get it right\n\nBut I couldn't understand it\n\nAnd I tripped and I fell on myself\n\nYou were right where I landed\n\nYour song that I've sung all along\n\nAnd the mountain was climbing\n\nLooking out, even now\n\nNot a doubt you're the rhythm inside me\n\n\n\nAll of the things I've been through\n\nYou put 'em in the rear view\n\nEverything that you hold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\nYou hold the doors wide open\n\nThere's nothing your love leaves broken\n\nEverything that you hold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\n\n\nBut the beautiful thing that you do\n\nIs making new things out of ruins\n\n\n\nAll of the things I've been through\n\nYou put 'em in the rear view\n\nEverything that you hold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\nYou hold the doors wide open\n\nThere's nothing your love leaves broken\n\nEverything that you hold\n\nYou make it shine like gold\n\nYou make it shine like gold"
