  "lyrics": "Fallen like a hammer on a solitary ark\r\nIt struck a nail and now we'll never be apart\r\nJust a shadow on the wall\r\nAnd I curse the ground beneath my feet\r\nCurse the boiling sea\r\nCurse the stars above my head, staring back at me\n\nDamn the whip that cracked and split\n\nDamn the hand behind it\n\n\n\nWait for me by my gallow's pole\n\nHang around, I won't be long\n\n\n\nBorderline\n\nGet me out alive\n\nWhen it rains\n\nI am right where I belong\n\n\n\nI'm sorry but the voice inside my head won't let me go\n\nI know you won't forgive me for the things you'll never know\n\nCome back to me sweet Armageddon\n\nHurry up and find me\n\n\n\nWait for me by the iron rail\n\nHold on\n\n\n\nBorderline\n\nGet me out alive\n\nWhen it rains\n\nI am right where I belong\n\n\n\nAcross the borderline\n\nThe architect stopped by his design\n\nI never fell so hard\n\nYou'll be the axe, I'm your hesitation marks\n\n\n\nBorderline\n\nGets me out alive\n\nWhen it rains\n\nFire erased"
