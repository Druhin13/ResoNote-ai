  "lyrics": "Tell me all the things I'm supposed to like\r\nWhat you want to hear, what think is right\r\nI'm not present, my thoughts are misaligned\r\nCause every time I close my eyes too tight\r\nIt's the Fall of 1929\n\nA panic, playing out in black and white\n\n\n\nI fill myself with doubt, I feel like I sold out\n\nI feel like I am down, I'm down without a doubt\n\nI feel like I let down, everyone around\n\nI feel like nothing counts, I'm down without a doubt\n\nI've filled myself with doubt\n\n\n\nMaybe I was made for normal life\n\nWhere I'm in at 9 and I'm out by 5\n\nAnd there's goals, I'd hit them every time\n\n\n\nI could sell plans of different types\n\nTo wealthy men and their trophy wives\n\nAnd go home, see the kids at night\n\n\n\nI fill myself with doubt, I feel like I sold out\n\nI feel like I am down, I'm down without a doubt\n\nI feel like I let down, everyone around\n\nI feel like nothing counts, I'm down without a doubt\n\nI've filled myself with doubt\n\n\n\nNever good enough, never satisfied with nothing\n\nNever good enough, never satisfied with nothing\n\nNever good enough, never satisfied with nothing\n\nNever good enough, never satisfied with nothing\n\nNever good enough, never satisfied with nothing\n\nNever good enough, never satisfied with nothing\n\n\n\nI fill myself with doubt, I feel like I sold out\n\nI feel like I am down, I'm down without a doubt\n\nI feel like I let down, everyone around\n\nI feel like nothing counts, I'm down without a doubt\n\nI've filled myself with doubt"
