It's still coming soon\n\n\n\nDo you hear me man?\n\nDo you understand? I am Black\n\nI'm a nigga, do you understand me?\n\nI was born black, I live black, and I'ma die probably because I'm black, because some cracker that knows I'm black better than you, nigga, is probably gonna put a bullet in the back of my head"
