  "lyrics": "Buckle yourself down, life is a ride\r\nFind a purpose, buy your time\r\nKnow that I'm falling, falling for you\r\nWe're all searching for some truth\r\nCrawling and falling, breaking apart\r\nThis is love and I have scars\n\nGave her my all, yeah gave her my heart\n\nI won't be here after dark\n\nI won't be here after dark\n\n\n\nI run circles while we chase our tails\n\nI won't fail you\n\nNo one's perfect but we make our way out\n\nEvery day that's new\n\n\n\nBrace for an impact, pray for a change\n\nHope your God can help your stay\n\nThrowing a punch now, picking a fight\n\nDo you sleep alone most nights?\n\nHow 'bout this weather? Look at the sun\n\nHeard tomorrow rain might come\n\nI didn't notice, notice the fall\n\nI got lost between the fall\n\nI am lost between this all\n\n\n\nI run circles while we chase our tails\n\nI won't fail you\n\nNo one's perfect but we make our way out\n\nEvery day that's new\n\n\n\n'Cause I want to see this through\n\nAnd I do it all for you\n\nI run circles while we chase our tails\n\nI won't fail you\n\n\n\nAnd I just can't believe it (I just can't believe it)\n\nAll these things that I'm seeing (All these things that I'm seeing)\n\nBecause I gave you everything I've got\n\n\n\nI run circles while we chase our tails\n\nI won't fail you\n\nNo one's perfect but we make our way out\n\nEvery day that's new\n\n\n\n'Cause I want to see this through\n\nAnd I do it all for you\n\nI run circles while we chase our tails\n\nI won't fail you\n\nNo, I won't fail you\n\nNo, I won't fail you\n\nNo, I won't fail you\n\n\n\nThink love and loathing's all I've got\n\nSometimes I think it's all I want"
