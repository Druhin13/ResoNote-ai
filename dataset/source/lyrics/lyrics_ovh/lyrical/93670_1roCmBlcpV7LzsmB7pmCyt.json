  "lyrics": "This night is cold in the kingdom\r\nI can feel you fade away\r\nFrom the kitchen to the bathroom sink and\r\nYour steps keep me awake\r\nDon't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste\n\nI once was a man with dignity and grace\n\nNow I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace\n\nSo please, please\n\n\n\nCould you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nA little sympathy, I hope you can show me\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly\n\nLet me down, down, let me down, down, let me down\n\nLet me down, down, let me down, down, let me down\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nI hold on to little pieces of what we were\n\nI know we're long gone, but take it easy\n\nBecause it hurts\n\n\n\nDon't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste\n\nI once was a girl with dignity and grace\n\nNow I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace\n\nSo please, please\n\n\n\nCould you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nA little sympathy, I hope you can show me\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly\n\nLet me down, down, let me down, down, let me down\n\nLet me down, down, let me down, down, let me down\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby let me down slowly\n\n\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\nAnd I can't stop myself from falling down\n\n\n\nCould you find a way to let me down slowly?\n\nA little sympathy, I hope you can show me\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly\n\nLet me down, down, let me down, down, let me down\n\nLet me down, down, let me down, down, let me down\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby let me down slowly\n\nIf you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely\n\nIf you're leaving, baby let me down slowly"
