  "lyrics": "Put your phone away\r\nI know you want to check it\r\nThis is one of those nights\r\nAnd I don't want to wreck it\r\nWith distractions and worries\r\n'Bout what all could go wrong tomorrow\n\nSo live in this moment\n\nAnd know that there's no time to borrow\n\n\n\nIt's a crazy, crazy world out there\n\nBut baby, baby don't be scared\n\nCause I got you and you got me\n\nWe can set each other free\n\nOne day, one day when we're old\n\nWe'll look back, look back\n\nAnd we'll know\n\nWe always kept our dreams alive\n\nLove and laughed until we cried\n\nRuled the streets until the morning light\n\nSingin' long live tonight\n\nSingin' long live tonight\n\n\n\nI know an old spot\n\nIt ain't that cool\n\nBut they got a little dance floor\n\nWe can act like fools\n\nWe'll ask the DJ to play every song from the 90s\n\nWe'll tear it up 'til the Sun starts to rise and it's blinding\n\n\n\nIt's a crazy, crazy world out there\n\nBut baby, baby don't be scared\n\nCause I got you and you got me\n\nWe can set each other free\n\nOne day, one day when we're old\n\nWe'll look back, look back\n\nAnd we'll know\n\nWe always kept our dreams alive\n\nLove and laughed until we cried\n\nRuled the streets until the morning light\n\nSingin' long live tonight\n\nSingin' long live tonight\n\n\n\nLong live, long live\n\nTonight, tonight\n\nLong live, long live\n\nTonight, tonight\n\n\n\nIt's a crazy, crazy world out there\n\nBut baby, baby don't be scared\n\nCause I got you and you got me\n\nWe can set each other free\n\nOne day, one day when we're old\n\nWe'll look back, look back\n\nAnd we'll know\n\nWe always kept our dreams alive\n\nLove and laughed until we cried\n\nRuled the streets until the morning light\n\nSingin' long live tonight\n\nSingin' long live tonight"
