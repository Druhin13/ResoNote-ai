  "lyrics": "There's a hole in my head\r\nThere’s a hole in my heart\r\nThere's a hole in the wall\r\nThat wasn't there in the start\r\nThere’s a hole in the feeling\r\nFucking hole in the ceiling\n\nBut they still don't believe it\n\nNo they never could see it\n\n\n\nThere's a tear in the seam\n\nThere's a bend in the pane\n\nThere's a glitch in the stream\n\nBut we just fell there between\n\nThere's a fault in the system\n\nSo much talk but no listen\n\nSo much empathy missing\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like everything is falling apart\n\nOh it feels like everything is falling apart\n\n\n\nGot your head in the sand\n\nGot your soul on a stand\n\nSay you're so educated\n\nWith your elaborate plans\n\nYou don't care to correct it\n\nKeep yourself unaffected\n\nWho are you really protecting?\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like everything is falling apart\n\nOh it feels like everything is falling apart\n\n\n\nWay I wanna feel like\n\nWay I wanna feel like with one\n\nDon’t wanna feel like\n\nDon’t wanna feel like it's done\n\nWay I wanna feel like\n\n(Way I wanna feel like)\n\nWay I wanna feel like with one\n\n(With one)\n\nDon’t wanna feel like\n\n(Don't wanna feel like)\n\nDon't wanna feel like it's done\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like everything is falling apart\n\nOh it feels like everything is falling apart\n\n\n\nOh it feels like everything is falling apart"
