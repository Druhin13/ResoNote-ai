  "lyrics": "I gave you less when you begged for more\r\nI showed contempt, you chose to ignore\r\nI never said I wanted you dead\r\nBut the thought entered my head\r\nI swore I'd love you till the day I died\r\nThere's nothing left of me, I'm dead inside\n\nSo cut me open, I've got nothing to hide\n\nYou can keep whatever you find\n\n\n\nYou and I\n\nLive inside your mind\n\nAnd I just need a way out\n\nYou and I\n\nTrapped inside your mind\n\nAnd I can't find a way out\n\n\n\nYou wanted more than a piece of mind\n\nSo you ran and took a piece of mine\n\nI bet the truth wasn't hard to find\n\nHow the hell could you be so blind\n\nYou're like the devil with a heart of stone\n\nYou must be petrified to be alone\n\nTurn up the hate, yeah, why should we wait\n\nDestiny is my favorite date\n\n\n\nWas all of this just a distraction\n\nSay things just for the reaction\n\nI never said that I wanted you dead\n\nBut the thought entered my head\n\n\n\nYou and I\n\nLive inside your mind\n\nAnd I just need a way out\n\nYou and I\n\nTrapped inside your mind\n\nAnd I can't find a way out\n\n\n\nLet's face it\n\nBoth your faces\n\nNeed defacing\n\nWell let's face it\n\nAll your faces\n\nNeed erasing\n\n\n\nYou wanted more but I gave you less\n\nYou gave me hell instead of happiness\n\nYou needed more so I gave you less\n\n[?]\n\n\n\nYou and I\n\nLive inside your mind\n\nAnd I just need a way out\n\nYou and I\n\nTrapped inside your mind\n\nAnd I can't find [?]\n\nYou and I\n\nLive inside your mind\n\nAnd I just need a way out\n\nYou and I\n\nAre trapped inside your mind\n\nAnd I can't pull the trigger on you"
