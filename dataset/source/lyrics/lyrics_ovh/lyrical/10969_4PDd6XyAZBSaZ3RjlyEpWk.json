  "lyrics": "Reeling in the line\r\nFully saccharine\r\nAll these stagnant words which I confide\r\nPerish in the night\r\nAnyway so\r\nHere we go again\n\nAlways faintly preying\n\nDid I note a tremble on your arm\n\nThereupon alarmed\n\nJust give in\n\n\n\nMake me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it\n\nCome make me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it, catch it, catch it, catch it\n\n\n\nTime moves forward quickly\n\nMoves in twenty-four\n\nHour segments racing for the soul\n\nTo grab chokehold\n\nOf the minute hands\n\nLeft without a trace\n\nJust a fleeting face\n\nFlicker as a figment once before my eyes\n\nPerished in the night\n\n\n\nYou want it, you want it, you want it again\n\nWhy don't you come and ask me, I adore you my friend\n\nI said you need it, you need it, you need it again\n\nTrust me, these arbitrary thrills will never fail to transcend\n\n\n\nMake me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it\n\nCome make me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it, catch it, catch it, catch it\n\n\n\nCome make me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it, catch it, catch it, catch it, catch it\n\nCome make me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it, catch it, catch it, catch it\n\n\n\nI said you want it, you want it, you want it again\n\nWhy don't you come and touch it, I adore you, my friend\n\nI said you need it, you need it, you need it again\n\nTrust me, these arbitrary thrills, they never fail to transcend\n\nMake me real\n\nYou reel in then you catch it\n\nCatch it\n\nCatch it"
