  "lyrics": "I ain't nothin’ but the ashes on your cigarette\r\nTo the ground, to the ground, lay me down, you make me upset\r\nGood at pushin' me away, swear that you're the best\r\nI wear my heart on my sleeve, yeah, yours deep in your chest\r\nI don’t do this for me, I do this for you\n\nAlways wondering why I got involved\n\nYou were never there when I'm feelin' low (Low)\n\nAnd now I just don't know what the fuck to do (Do, do, do, do)\n\n\n\nNo more fighting, we fight (We fight)\n\nFrom mornin' to night (Morning to night)\n\nWhen we were feelin' all right, girl, do we shine (Shine)\n\nBut now emotions gone cold (Gone cold)\n\nYou don't love me no more (No more)\n\nYeah, all the truths they unfold between you and I\n\nSo I'm saying goodbye\n\nOoh\n\nOoh\n\n\n\nSay I ain’t nothin’ but the feelin' from that bottle (From that bottle)\n\nYou feelin’ numb sometimes, the truth is hard to swallow (Yeah)\n\nAnd when we fight you always tellin' me don't come around\n\nI admit I'm fallin’ for you even though I'm down and out\n\nKnock me off my pedestal then grind it down a level (Yeah)\n\nEver since you left I swear my mind been so unsettled\n\nLike, are we still together, or are you feelin' fed up? (Yeah)\n\nYeah, I used to be a dog, on the real you make me better\n\n\n\nNo more fighting, we fight (We fight)\n\nFrom mornin' to night (Morning to night)\n\nWhen we were feelin' all right, girl, do we shine (Shine)\n\nBut now emotions gone cold (Gone cold)\n\nYou don't love me no more (No more)\n\nYeah, all the truths they unfold between you and I\n\nSo I'm saying goodbye\n\nOoh\n\nOoh\n\nOoh\n\nOoh"
