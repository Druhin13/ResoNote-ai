  "lyrics": "Haven't we all loved things in the darkness?\r\nHaven't we all lied if we're honest?\r\nWe cheat and cover up to protect what people think of us\r\nBut we end up hostage to all our secrets\r\nSo let the light shine in\n\nLet the light shine in\n\nOur God chased us all down into death\n\nTo lift us out of the shame we live in\n\nSo let the light shine in\n\n\n\nWe're not a lost cause\n\nWe're not unlovable\n\nCause He takes the broken and makes them beautiful\n\nThere may be pain there may be consequence\n\nBut we know we don't have to stand condemned\n\nHe came to free us from all our secrets\n\n\n\nSo let the light shine in\n\nLet the light shine in\n\nOur God chased us all down into death\n\nTo lift us out of the shame we live in\n\nSo let the light shine in\n\n\n\nHis blood is enough to wash over the worst of us\n\nMade clean, set free, redeemed\n\nYeah, His blood is enough to wash over the worst of us\n\nMade clean, set free, redeemed, yeah\n\n\n\nSo let the light shine in\n\nOh, let the light shine in\n\nOur God chased us all down into death\n\nTo lift us out of the shame we live in\n\nSo let the light shine in"
