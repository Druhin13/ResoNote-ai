  "lyrics": "I've been praying asking God for help\r\nBut lately, it feels like I've been talking to myself\r\nI've been waiting for life to get better\r\nAnd I need to cry but I'm afraid to cry 'cause I just might cry forever\r\nSometimes I wonder, If it's all just chance\r\nAnd I'm just spinning on a pavement being told to dance\n\nAnd hallelujah, is just another word when you're empty, lost and broken and it don't take away the hurt\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know why, why it's gotta be so damn hard\n\nWhy it always falls apart\n\nWhy it always crown to see the star\n\nCare for my fragile heart\n\nWe're all living in a house of cards\n\n\n\nAnd I still miss you and don't want you back\n\nAnd I'm out here under the Mirrormere digging up the past\n\nAnd I'm a dreamer, who'll nobody knows, 'cause deep in my soul I'm scared of the death, there's is a voice in my head\n\nYou got to get better, it's now or Ã­t's never\n\nNot good enough, good enough ooo, just show off, show off, show off in the air\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know why, why it got to be so damn hard\n\nWhy it always falls apart\n\nWhy it always crown to see the stars\n\nCare for my fragile heart\n\nCare for my fragile heart\n\nWe're all living in a house of cards"
