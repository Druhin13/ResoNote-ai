  "lyrics": "All the silhouettes that pass us by\r\nThe sound of shrieks and familiar cries\r\nWill vanish into the illusion\r\nNo serenity, never compromise\r\nThere’s no dignity as you fraternize\r\nWith your delusions\n\nSo set me free, take all you need\n\nAnd I will wait\n\nTogether we’re jaded\n\nAnd now we’re renovated\n\n\n\nWings of flames are burning the wreckage of my life\n\nAt last I’ve terrified us, set fire to the stars at night\n\nThey can’t be this far, the judgement now begins\n\nA being from the inside\n\n\n\nVanishing into thin air\n\nMy body hits the floor\n\nI’m smaller than before\n\nCrisis lit up above[?]\n\nEmergency report[?]\n\nI watch them dancing\n\nOh, the fireflies at war gather\n\nOh, the damage that’s been done, paid for\n\nWon’t you reveal yourself to me?\n\nAs I rise above the deep\n\nWon’t you reveal yourself to me?\n\nOh\n\n\n\nOh, the fireflies above gather\n\nOh, the damage that’s been done, paid for\n\nNow won’t you save yourself for me?\n\nWon’t you save yourself for me?\n\nOh"
