  "lyrics": "I got plans this friday\r\nSaturday too\r\nHell, most everyday I got something to do\r\nAnd lonely don't own me\r\nThere's somebody who wants me\r\nIt always feels right till I wear off the new\n\n\n\nMy heart isn't broken, it's sleeping long\n\nEvery smile I try to start, just goes up and smoke\n\nI hate to admit it but this don't come true\n\nCause nobody, nobody, nobody\n\nHold a candle to you\n\n\n\nMy friends like the guy I'm seeing these days\n\nOh, he makes me laugh\n\nBut, not in the same way\n\nYou laughed over nothing, I was stupid for running\n\nI think that scared me how easy loving you can\n\n\n\nOh, heart isn't broken, it's sleeping long\n\nEvery smile I try to start, just goes up and smoke\n\nI hate to admit it but this don't come true\n\nCause nobody, nobody, nobody\n\nHold a candle to you\n\n\n\nI hate to admit it but this don't come true\n\nCause nobody, nobody, nobody\n\nHold a candle to you\n\nOh\n\n\n\nNobody, nobody, nobody, oh\n\nHold a candle to you\n\nNo"
