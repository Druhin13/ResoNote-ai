  "lyrics": "A million miles from crescent skies\r\nFar from light or dire times\r\nWe exercise our right to fly up eye to eye 'til we arrive\r\nAnd as we fall back down to our demise\r\nTo a pillow case and a mighty sigh\r\nShort of breath from a climb this high\n\nI think, \"What a decline.\"\n\nIf this is it I'm fine with dying\n\nSay goodbye to everything that I am\n\nFlesh and mind\n\nThoughts of Freud\n\nAnd hello odes of joy\n\nI'm your newest employee waiting to be assigned\n\nAnd oh how I will oblige\n\nBlindly, kind, without a fight\n\nLet's rest\n\n(Sex)"
