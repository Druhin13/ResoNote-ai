  "lyrics": "Baby, how you got no soul?\r\nIs your heart a gaping hole?\r\nHow come I didn't see that in you?\r\nHow come I can forgive you?\r\nAnd if you loved me\r\nYou wouldn't put me through this\n\nNo, If you loved me\n\nYou wouldn't put me through it\n\n\n\nThat makes you a killer, a killer, a killer\n\nThat makes you a killer, a killer, a killer\n\n\n\nForever is for dreamers and it's\n\nFoolish to not know you're a schemer\n\nIt's silly to think of our unborn children\n\nIt's all I'm really thinking about\n\nRight now is just how I will never know them\n\n\n\nThat makes you a killer, a killer, a killer\n\nThat makes you a killer, a killer, a killer"
