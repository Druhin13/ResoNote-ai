  "lyrics": "It burns like a firework inside my head\r\nCan't learn, think i'm the only girl inside your bed\r\nTouch me in the summer time\r\nCrush me in the winter time\r\nTouch me in the summer time\r\nCrush me in the winer time\n\n\n\nI've been chewed up and spit out and trampled on\n\nBut I like it, the taste of a love gone wrong\n\nAll this fighting\n\nThis feeling inside my bones\n\nI've been staring 'till something lights up my phone\n\nBlack mirror\n\n\n\nIt's drugs, i'm addicted and I just can't quit\n\nOne sip, his skin is whiskey on my lips\n\nTouch me in the summer time\n\nCrush me in the winter time\n\nTouch me in the summer time\n\nCrush me in the winer time\n\n\n\nI've been chewed up and spit out and trampled on\n\nBut I like it, the taste of a love gone wrong\n\nAll this fighting\n\nThis feeling inside my bones\n\nI've been staring 'till something lights up my phone\n\nBlack mirror\n\n\n\nI've been chewed up and spit out and trampled on\n\nBut I like it, the taste of a love gone wrong\n\nAll this fighting\n\nThis feeling inside my bones\n\nI've been staring 'till something lights up my phone\n\nBlack mirror"
