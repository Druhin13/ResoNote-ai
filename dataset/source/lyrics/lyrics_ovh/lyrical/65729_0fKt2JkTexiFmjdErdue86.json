  "lyrics": "The raven's flown away\nThe wolf begins to shiver\nWho will pay the price?\nThe Hunter will remember\nRise, fall, stand again\n\n\nI'm awake, I'm alive\n\nStanding my ground until it's time\n\n\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nI am sorry, but I will break you\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nThe sky is falling\n\nTaste our revolution\n\n\n\nWe're trembling in the night\n\nBut hard is our emotions\n\nIron to the sky\n\nReclaiming our souls\n\n\n\nI will climb, and I will strike\n\nOne for every burning scar\n\n\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nI am sorry, but I will break you\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nThe sky is falling\n\nTaste our revolution\n\n\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nI am sorry, but I will break you\n\n\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nThe sky is falling\n\nTaste our revolution\n\n\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nI am sorry, but I will break you\n\n\n\nAnd the rising awakes\n\nThe sky is falling\n\nTaste our revolution"
