  "lyrics": "There's yelling in the hallway\r\nI found refuge on a twin bed of a three star hotel\r\nI hear the laughter from the TV\r\nStatic Rachel talks to Phoebe\r\nAbout the cat that snarls\r\nAnd I know this place is haunted, oh\n\nI swear I hear somebody knocking\n\nBut I can't really tell\n\n\n\nAnd this outlet's busted\n\nPhone out and I can't charge it\n\nWhat a life man, what a life this is, hmm\n\n\n\nJust me, myself and nothing\n\nBut I taught me how to love it\n\nHome is wherever I live\n\n\n\nAh ah, Ah ah, Ah ah ah\n\nAh ah, Ah ah, Ah ah ah\n\n\n\nI remember our own mama call\n\nAs I hang my stray hairs on the shower walls for decoration\n\nI wonder what I'd hear if rooms could talk\n\nAnd I wonder why I'm thinking that at all\n\nI'm going crazy\n\n\n\nAnd this toilet's rusted\n\nFood came but I don't trust it\n\nWhat a life man, what a life this is\n\n\n\nJust me, myself and nothing\n\nBut I taught me how to love it\n\nHome is wherever I live\n\n\n\nAh ah, Ah ah, Ah ah ah\n\nAh ah, Ah ah, Ah ah ah\n\n\n\nHard to sleep sometimes\n\nWith no one by my side\n\nI do my best to find a sense in it\n\nThe more the days go by\n\nThe more myself and I\n\nShake hands and realize the benefits of independence\n\n\n\nAnd it's really something\n\nTo make home's a worn-out luggage\n\nWhat a life man, what a life this is, yeah\n\n\n\nJust me, myself and nothing\n\nBut somehow I've learned to love it\n\nHome is wherever I live\n\n\n\nAh ah, Ah ah, Ah ah ah\n\nAh ah, Ah ah, Ah ah ah\n\n\n\nHome is wherever I live\n\nHome is wherever I live"
