  "lyrics": "I catch a chill when I look into your eyes\r\nSomething too familiar, I seem to recognize\r\nLike lookin' in the mirror baby\r\nAnd I'm scared of what I see\r\nLookin' at you baby, is the dark side of me\n\nComin' from the same place, two of a kind\n\nBrought up on the wrong side of a one track mind\n\nWhenever we're together baby,\n\nWe're as bad as we can be\n\nLookin' at you baby, is the dark side of me\n\n\n\nThere's two sides to every story\n\nFor every shame there's a glory\n\nAnd I've tried to keep a balance\n\nBetween the dark and the light\n\nBut something don't add up\n\nWhen I'm with you, how can two wrongs feel so right\n\nFeel so right\n\n\n\nWell it's a one way conversation between you and I\n\nYou ask all the right questions and need no reply\n\nOn all the wrong answers baby, we always tend to agree\n\nLookin' at you baby, is the dark side of me\n\n\n\nLookin' at you baby, is the dark side of me"
