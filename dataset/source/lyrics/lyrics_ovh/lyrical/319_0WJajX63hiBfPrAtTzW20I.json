  "lyrics": "I know how to speak\r\nAnd I know where I’m going\r\nI wanted to seek\r\nBut I got distracted\r\nIt’s a mirage\n\nThat leaves me embarrassed\n\nBecause no one knows me like you\n\nYou know there’s nothing left for you\n\nSo I continually move\n\nTry to pass it through for ya\n\n\n\nThe past about pain\n\nIs timeless and honest\n\nLet go of your shame\n\nIt’s a dead dampening blanket\n\nIt’s a facade\n\nBack and look at your training\n\n\n\nThere’s nobody else like you\n\nI think I finally explained it\n\nSo I continue to move\n\nTry to pass it through for ya\n\n\n\nI want your name\n\nIt's burnt in my ceilings\n\nAnd I want it all\n\nAn unpredictable wonder\n\nYou gave it all hope\n\nThat all of this is a circle\n\n\n\nThere’s nobody else like you\n\nSo many that came before ya\n\nThis is the moment I choose\n\nBetween the hope and the hardest\n\nBe honest"
