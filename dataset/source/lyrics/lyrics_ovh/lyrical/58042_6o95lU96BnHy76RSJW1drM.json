  "lyrics": "From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore\rThe green old flowing mountains to the south down by the moor\rShe's mighty tall and handsome she's know quite well by all\rRegular combination on the Wabash Cannonball\rListen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar\rAs she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore\rHear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call\rAs you travel across the country on the Wabash Cannonball Oh the eastern states are dandy so the people always say\rFrom New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way\rTo the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall\rNo changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball Here's to Daddy Claxton may his name forever stand\rIn the hills of Tennessee and in the courts throughout the land\rWhen his earthly race are over and them curtains round him fall\rWould we take him home to Dixy on the Wabash Cannonball\rI went down from Birmingham one cold December day\rWhen she pulled into that station you could hear them people say\rThere's a fellow from Tennessee, boys, he's long and he's tall\rHe came down from Alabamon the Wabash Cannonball Oh listen to that jingle, the rumble and the roar\rAs she glides along the woodland o'er hills and by the shore\rHear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call\rYou're travelling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball"
