  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Boys In The Better Land par Fontaines D.C.\r\nYou're not alive until you start kicking\nWhen the room is spinning and the words ain't sticking\nAnd the radio is all about a run away model with a face like sin and a heart like a James Joyce novel\n\nSaying \"sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya\nLet's go wrist to wrist and take the skin off of my blister\"\nIf you're a Rock Star, Porn Star, Superstar, doesn't matter what you are, get yourself a good car, get outta here\n\nBut the boys in the better land\n\nYou're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land\nThe boys in the better land\nBut the boys in the better land\nYou're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land\nThe boys in the better land\n\nDriver's got names to fill two double barrels\nHe spits out \"Brits out\". Only smoke carrolls\nNow we're refreshing the world in mind body and spirit\nMind body and spirit\nYou better hear it and fear it\nOh thats the spirit\n\nSaying \"sister, sister, how I missed ya, missed ya, let's go wrist to wrist, and take the skin off of my blister\"\n\nIf you're a Rock Star, Porn Star, Superstar, doesn't matter what you are, get yourself a good car, get outta here\n\nBut the boys in the better land\nYou're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land\nThe boys in the better land\nBut the boys in the better land\nYou're always talking 'bout the boys in the better land\nThe boys in the better land"
