  "lyrics": "You used to be my confidante\r\nMy underneath-the-staircase friend\r\nBut I fell out of love with you\r\nAnd brought our romance to an end\r\nI played with you throughout the day\r\nAnd told you every secret thought\n\nUnlike my other so-called friends\n\nYou stood beside me as I fought\n\n\n\nIn your reflected glory eye\n\nCould dream of shining far off lands\n\nWish I could turn to bits of string\n\nAnd play like kittens in my hand\n\n\n\nIn our imaginary world\n\nWith butterflies were on me boots\n\nAnd stomp around the forests\n\nChanting long lost anthems\n\nLong lost anthems\n\n\n\nYou used to be my confidante\n\nMy underneath-the-staircase friend\n\nBut I fell out of love with you\n\nAnd brought our romance to an end\n\nI played with you throughout the day\n\nAnd told you every secret thought\n\nUnlike my other so-called friends\n\nYou stood beside me as I fought\n\nYou stood beside me as I fought\n\n\n\nYou used to be my confidante"
