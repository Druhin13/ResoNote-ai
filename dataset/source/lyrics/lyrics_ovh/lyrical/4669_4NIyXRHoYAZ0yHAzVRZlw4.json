  "lyrics": "Drove by your old apartment\r\nLooking for a way to start it over again\r\nCuz you’ve been stuck in my head\r\nTried to open up about it\r\nCalled a friend to clear my conscience\r\nThey said there’s nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell and I don’t know what to do about it\n\n\n\nClimbed to the roof and looked out\n\nStood on the edge and looked down\n\nHolding my breath so I get to feel something now\n\nFound a girl that looks just like you\n\nShe doesn't do the things that you do\n\nI get upset at nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell and I don’t know what to do about it\n\n\n\nParked at the fields where we met\n\nTell me where the hell has time been\n\nEvery day I feel like I’m just stuck on repeat\n\nDo you ever think about it\n\nCold sweats, three in the morning\n\nDo you ever feel it, feel it\n\n\n\nI miss you like\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell and I don’t know what to do about it\n\n\n\n(I miss you) No, I don’t know\n\n(I miss you) I miss you like hell\n\nI miss you like hell (I miss you)\n\nI don’t know what to do about it\n\n(I miss you) No, no (I miss you)\n\nI don’t know what to do about it"
