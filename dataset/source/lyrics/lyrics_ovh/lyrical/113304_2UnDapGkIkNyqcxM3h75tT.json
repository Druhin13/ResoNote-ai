I be blackin' out\n\nThese niggas want me in the books like I'm Pacquiao\n\nLosin' all my niggas, started drinkin' alcohol\n\nI jumped out the womb like my daddy the devil\n\nI walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm clever, yeah\n\nI walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm special, yeah\n\nI got a couple million, also tote a Beretta\n\nI dropped out of school just to get me some cheddar\n\n\n\nThis what it sound like\n\nLook what it sound like when a vulture cry\n\nLook what it sound like when a vulture cry\n\nBooted up, I'm high, booted up out my mind\n\nI'm booted up out my mind\n\nThis what it sound like when a vulture cry\n\nThis what it sound like when a vulture cry\n\nThis what it sound like when I try to cry\n\nI be tryin' to cry\n\nWhen my niggas died, I was tryin' to cry\n\nWhen my niggas died, I couldn't even watch you cry"
