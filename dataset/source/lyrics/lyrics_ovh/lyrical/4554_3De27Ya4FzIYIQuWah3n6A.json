  "lyrics": "I wonder who's to blame\r\nFor the world of the present\r\nTen bucks say it's a man\r\nFar from love and affection\r\nThis world was never meant for us\n\nNah-nah-nah, it's for the\n\nGirls and children first and then men\n\nBoys, man up\n\nNah-nah-nah, it's for the\n\nGirls and children first and then men, last\n\n\n\nDon't you abandon ship\n\nBe the savior of many\n\nOr drown right where you live\n\nKiss that fear in your belly\n\n\n\nThis world was never meant for us\n\nNah-nah-nah, it's for the\n\nGirls and children first and then men\n\nBoys, man up\n\nNah-nah-nah, it's for the\n\nGirls and children first and then men, last\n\n\n\nAnd I know you got the message\n\nWith love to you\n\nTook it home, but never read it\n\nWhat the fuck? So rude (I wonder who's to blame)\n\nWish you could man up\n\nIt can't be that tough\n\nShit ain't fair, never was, call it bad luck\n\nSuperman buff\n\nThought you were that tough\n\nI shed a tear, life ain't fair, call it bad luck\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nThis world was never meant for us\n\nNah-nah-nah, it's for the\n\nGirls and children first and then men\n\nBoys, man up\n\nNah-nah-nah, it's for the\n\nGirls and children first and then men, last"
