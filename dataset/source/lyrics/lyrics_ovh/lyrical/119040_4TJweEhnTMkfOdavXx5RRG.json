  "lyrics": "Perfume in my shirt\r\nPuts me in the past\r\nToo tough to be without her\r\nBut too afraid to ask\r\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\n\n\nToo young to settle down\n\nToo old to be in bars\n\nIt's hard to take it easy\n\nItâ€™s easy to be hard\n\n\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\n\n\nForgive me, I am building my ship as it sells\n\nHow do I become who I wanna be while still remaining myself\n\nDeeper, lover, hold me\n\nI don't know where he is gone\n\nToo tired to be famous\n\nToo vain to be unknown\n\n\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle\n\nHere I am again, stuck in the middle"
