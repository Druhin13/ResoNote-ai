  "lyrics": "As the river flows from afar\r\nNo matter how much you try to drain it\r\nHunger makes the stars wander on\r\nYour place is to grow what shall feed them\n\nAs the anger grows in your heart\n\nNo matter how much you try to deny it\n\nHunger makes his people go on\n\nOur place is to grow what shall feed them\n\n\n\nRain is falling on the fields\n\nThey grow on me\n\nReach towards the sun\n\nOne day you will join the soil\n\nBut first we grow\n\n\n\nMy field\n\nMy seeds\n\nI am the harvest\n\nAs the gods all watch as we craw\n\nNo matter what we will stand by our master\n\nOur cradles and our graves under stones\n\nDug up by fathers resting beneath us\n\n\n\nRain is falling on the fields\n\nThey grow on me\n\nReach towards the sun\n\nOne day you will joint he soil\n\nBut first we grow\n\n\n\nMy field\n\nMy seeds\n\nI am the harvest\n\n\n\nAs I lift this child from the ground\n\nNo matter how long it takes, he's returning\n\nOur destiny is written in dirt\n\nNurtured by mothers raised by the seasons\n\n\n\nRain is falling on the fields\n\nThey grow on me\n\nReach towards the sun\n\nOne day you will joint he soil\n\nBut first we grow\n\n\n\nMy field\n\nMy seeds\n\nI am the harvest"
