  "lyrics": "Like a bad tool\r\nTo open all the way\r\nThe lover's are cruel\r\nEveryone's insane\r\nNobody's fool\r\nThey play it all the same\n\nWho's in the mood\n\nTo give themselves away\n\n\n\nI won't sleep, you can't sleep\n\nRun in circles, run until I left\n\nI won't sleep, you can't sleep\n\nRun in circles, run until I left\n\nI won't sleep, you can't sleep\n\nRun in circles, run until I left\n\n\n\nI'm just a fool\n\nJust me inside your head\n\nTell me the truth\n\nIt's you inside my head\n\nCovered in blue\n\nThe way we trash ourselves\n\nWho's in the mood\n\nTo give it all away\n\n\n\nI won't sleep, you can't sleep\n\nRun in circles, run until I left\n\nI won't sleep, you can't sleep\n\nRun in circles, run until I left\n\nI won't sleep, you can't sleep\n\nRun in circles, run until I left"
