  "lyrics": "There's a place for us,\rSomewhere a place for us.\rPeace and quiet and open air,\rWait for us Somewhere.\rThere's a time for us,\rSomeday a time for us.\rTime together with time to spare,\rTime to learn, time to care.\rSomeday, somewhere,\rWe'll find a new way of living,\rWe'll find a way of forgiving.\rSomewhere.\rThere's a place for us,\rA time and place for us.\rHold my hand and we're halfway there,\rHold my hand and I'll take you there.\rSomehow, someday, somewhere."
