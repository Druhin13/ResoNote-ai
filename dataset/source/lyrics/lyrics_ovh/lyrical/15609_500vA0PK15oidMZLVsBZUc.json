  "lyrics": "Walking around with your head bent down\r\nComplacent in a sedated state\r\nI wanted to hear what you had to say\r\nBut there was too much talking over each other\r\nFind me some peace, a mindful heart\n\nA break in the tide when the fighting starts\n\nPower's down and the town goes dark\n\nWhen words fail we scatter\n\n\n\nUnder the wheels\n\nOf the war machine\n\nAlways someone else's scheme\n\nShow me a sign\n\nWhen the world falls apart\n\nFrom the core to the seams\n\nThe threads that we seek\n\n\n\nAll the way in and totally gone\n\nThe panic button is dead to me now\n\nChanging your shape in your overcoat\n\nBut somehow you manage to stay afloat\n\n\n\nDefy the system\n\nAnd avoiding the eyes that stay well hid\n\nSurrendered the words while the lovers leap\n\nOut of the fray and into the infinite\n\n\n\nDeep\n\nIn the war regime\n\nAlways someone else's scheme\n\nShow me a sign\n\nWhen the world falls apart\n\nComing together from all of the corners tonight\n\nFrom the core to the seams\n\nFrom the threads that we seek\n\nThe threads that we seek\n\n\n\nFind me some peace, a mindful heart\n\nA break in the tide when the fighting starts\n\nPower's down and the town goes dark\n\nWhen words fail we scatter\n\n\n\nUnder the wheels\n\nOf the war machine\n\nAlways someone else's scheme\n\nShow me a sign\n\nWhen the world falls apart\n\nComing together from all of the corners tonight\n\nFrom the core to the seams\n\nFrom the threads that we keep"
