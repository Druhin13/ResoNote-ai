  "lyrics": "Total confusion- one final sin\r\nSomeone's religion and greed\r\nAccidents happen, someone to blame\r\nWho's got the answers we need?\r\nI don't know who to believe\n\nBut I know who's gonna set me free\n\nCause I'll be waiting\n\n\n\nWhen heaven comes down\n\n\n\nAshes to ashes, sorrow and shame\n\nLook at the future again\n\nAngels in heaven walking the streets\n\nSearching for someone to blame\n\n\n\nI don't know who to believe\n\nBut I know who's gonna set me free\n\nCause I'll be waiting\n\n\n\nWhen heaven comes down\n\nUntil tomorrow\n\nWhen heaven comes down\n\n\n\n'Cause I'll be waiting\n\nWhen heaven comes down\n\nUntil tomorrow\n\nWhen heaven comes down"
