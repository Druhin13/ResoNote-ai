  "lyrics": "When were dancing on the grass the band forgot to sway\r\nAnd I was walking on water and you were everything\r\nOh, moving on in, moving on in\r\nNew life is coming in\r\nAnd I was floating up so I almost forgot to fall\r\nBut when her castle's in the sky there ain't no ground at all\n\n\n\nI'm new crowned king\n\nI'm wild and I sing\n\nYou were everything\n\nI'm new crowned king\n\nWild and I sing\n\nYou were everything\n\n\n\nWhen you know you know\n\nWhen she swims high in the sky I sing the royal hymn\n\nWhen you know you know\n\nWhen you look me in the eyes you never think of him\n\nOh, don't fall for her flowers but for her roots\n\nOh, don't fall for her flowers, yeah, but for her roots\n\n\n\nAnd when the moon shimmers through the California leaves, oh baby\n\nAnd we will lie down on the beach and cry in ecstasy\n\nOh, moving on in, moving on in\n\nNew life is coming in\n\nWhen making love against the gates we heard this holy voice\n\nOh, and then the silver siren calls and crowns the baby boy\n\n\n\nOh, the new crowned king\n\nCries and he sings\n\nHe's everything\n\nOh, the new crowned king\n\nCries and he sings\n\nHe's everything"
