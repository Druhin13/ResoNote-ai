  "lyrics": "Sometimes you get a little bit frightened\r\nAfraid of the wind and the lightning\r\nSometimes you get a little bit insecure\r\nSometimes you wonder if you're even good enough\r\nHiding from the morning when it's too much\r\nBut there's so much waiting behind the door\n\n\n\nAnd I know and I know and I know\n\nThat you just wanna dance in the light\n\nDon't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?\n\nYou're alive\n\n\n\nSo just let your horses run\n\nTo the limit like never before\n\nLet's be lost and young\n\nWanna show you what your heart is made for\n\nLet your horses run\n\nRun, run, run, oh\n\nLet your horses run\n\nRun, run, run\n\n\n\nI saw you on the street just the other day\n\nYou looked so pretty when you smiled that way\n\nSo open up the door, let your heart escape\n\n\n\n'Cause I know and I know and I know\n\nThat you just wanna dance in the light\n\nDon't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?\n\nYou're alive\n\n\n\nSo just let your horses run\n\nTo the limit like never before\n\nLet's be lost and young\n\nWanna show you what your heart is made for\n\nLet your horses run\n\nRun, run, run, oh\n\nLet your horses run\n\nRun, run, run\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\n\n\nAnd I know and I know and I know\n\nThat you just wanna dance in the light\n\nDon't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?\n\nYou're alive\n\n'Cause I know and I know and I know\n\nThat you just wanna dance in the light\n\nDon't you know? Don't you know? Don't you know?\n\nYou're alive, you're alive\n\n\n\nLet your horses run\n\nTo the limit like never before\n\nLet's be lost and young (I wanna be lost)\n\nWanna show you what your heart is made for (show you)\n\nLet your horses run\n\nRun, run, run, oh\n\nLet your horses run\n\nRun, run, run, oh\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nLet 'em run\n\nDance in the light\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\n\nOoh\n\nRun, run, run\n\nOoh"
