  "lyrics": "You never need, you're American\r\nYou never take what you say seriously\r\nYou're on the bed\r\nYou're on the ledge of things\r\nYou've got it made\r\nAnd when you wake\n\nIt's all in vain\n\n\n\nYou never said you'd do anything\n\nYou made excuses for your mind\n\nObjective goal and collective\n\nDon't you dare forget it\n\nDon't you forget it\n\nDon't you forget\n\nDon't do it\n\n\n\nIn the age of military\n\nYou are engaged with such fanfare activity\n\nYou let them do things as they please\n\nIn a grave you're accounted for\n\nIf you were red you'd be spoken for\n\nYou're color blue is gray\n\n\n\nIn the arms of the one you love\n\nYou feel safe, you feel so above\n\nThe hunger on the streets\n\nWith your safe\n\nAnd your document in its place\n\nYour money, your gun\n\nYour conscience, sweet like honey\n\n\n\nYou forbade yourself to think\n\nSee where you are as you begin to sink\n\nIn your mirror, in your mirror\n\nIn your mirror, in your face\n\n\n\nIn your mirror, in your face"
