  "lyrics": "I'm losing hope, I'm out of touch\r\nToo late to say \"I've had enough\"\r\nIt's like every breath could be my last\r\nMy demons won't stay in the past\r\nAll alone\n\nOn my own\n\n\n\nPull me close I feel the water reach around my neck\n\nDon't let go just show me that there's better days ahead\n\nMake me see how I'm only half the person I should be\n\nPull me close set me free from this gravity\n\n\n\nI can't run forward and keep looking back\n\nHindsight has left me where I'm at\n\nI tried to run but I couldn't see\n\nThat you were right beside me\n\n\n\nAll alone\n\nOn my own\n\n\n\nPull me close I feel the water reach around my neck\n\nDon't let go just show me that there's better days ahead\n\nMake me see how I'm only half the person I should be\n\nPull me close set me free from this gravity\n\n\n\nThere is a light in the tunnel but it's distant\n\nOn my own and I don't think that I can fix this\n\nSet me free from this gravity\n\n\n\nPull me close I feel the water reach around my neck\n\nDon't let go just show me that there's better days ahead\n\nMake me see how I'm only half the person I should be\n\nPull me close set me free from this gravity\n\nPull me close set me free from this gravity"
