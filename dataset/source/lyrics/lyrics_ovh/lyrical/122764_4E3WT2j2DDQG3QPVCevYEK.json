  "lyrics": "I feel younger everyday\r\nThe more I grow, the less I seem to know\r\nI've been trying to keep my head straight\r\nWhere I roam, it never feels like home\r\nYou feel the weight of the world coming down on your head\r\nThese people looking at you, and now they're pulling you back\n\nI've gotten sick of all it, it's in the palm of my hand\n\nAnd I think it'll be there for good\n\n\n\nWe take a piss to ourselves, we draw a line on the sand\n\nWe say \"don't cross this, or else\", and then we put up a flag\n\nOh, how we worship the things that we don't quite understand\n\nOh, it's more dangerous than you know\n\n\n\nI've got a message that you can't ignore\n\nMaybe I'm just not the man I was before\n\nTake this from me, take this lonely heart\n\n'Cause I, 'cause I don't need it no more\n\nI've got a hunger you will never taste\n\nCraving a desire that won't go to waste\n\nTake this from me, take this lonely heart\n\nAnd I, I'm gonna make it my own\n\n\n\nSomeone took my ego away\n\nHate so long, I'll miss it now it's gone\n\nNow my youth is being replaced\n\nSo, good night, it's gonna be alright\n\n\n\n'Cause now I drink the good wine and now I get out of bed\n\nAnd now I let myself love, and I'm not scared of the end\n\nI take it all on the chin, and now I'd do it again\n\nBecause maybe it's time for a change\n\nI've got a pain in my neck, because I keep looking up\n\nI'm searching what's coming next, but it won't come from above\n\nAnd there's a hole in my chest, like there's a hole in the sun\n\nSo tell me, what's coming next? I'm searching what's coming next\n\nI've got a pain in my neck, because I keep looking up\n\nI'm searching what's coming next, but it won't come from above\n\nAnd there's a hole in my chest and I'll make it my heart\n\n\n\nI've got a message that you can't ignore\n\nMaybe I'm just not the man I was before\n\nTake this from me, take this lonely heart\n\n'Cause I, 'cause I don't need it no more\n\nI've got a hunger you will never taste\n\nCraving a desire that won't go to waste\n\nTake this from me, take this lonely heart\n\nAnd I, I'm gonna make it my own\n\n\n\nThere's a chance that you take, that you listen in the end\n\nWhen you break all the chains that you feel comfortable in\n\nThere's a chance that I'll take so my hunger can be free\n\nIn the end, in the end, in the end, in the end"
