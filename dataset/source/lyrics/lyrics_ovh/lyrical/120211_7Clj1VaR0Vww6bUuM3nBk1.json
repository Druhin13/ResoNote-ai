  "lyrics": "If I had all the money in the world\r\nI'd probably burn it all\r\nIf I had all the riches in the world\r\nI'd surely burn it all\r\nOne in a million, money gonna kill a man\n\nWhy must we lose control?\n\nBlaze up a fire storm, the people getting higher from\n\nThe smoke of another man's gold\n\n\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nIt was me, I set the world on fire\n\n\n\nIf I could rule the world\n\nYou know I'd love you all\n\nIf a smile could save the world\n\nYou know I'd heal you all\n\n\n\nBurn like a wildfire, lighting up the night sky\n\nLove is not never enough\n\nMaybe in another life, I'll see them on the other side\n\nThe people them all singing about love\n\n\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nIt was me, I set the world on fire\n\n\n\nWho wants control over everything?\n\nIf money steals your soul then only trouble it will bring\n\nLoving as a whole, only thing that conquers we\n\nSo let it be told, let the world them sing\n\n\n\nWho got a light? you put them light up to them herbs\n\nWe can smoke and get more higher when your mind it gets disturbed\n\nWe can set the world on fire and then watch as it all burns\n\nOr light it up and pass it, smoking all be taking turns\n\nDon't ever need no money, don't need silver don't need gold\n\nOnly thing them ever wanted is some herbs that they can hold\n\nIf the only thing you loves the kind of green that you can fold\n\nWe can set it all on fire, let the fire fill your soul\n\n\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nWho set the world on fire?\n\nIt was me, I set the world on fire"
