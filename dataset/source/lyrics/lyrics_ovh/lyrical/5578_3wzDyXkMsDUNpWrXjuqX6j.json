  "lyrics": "Remember me\r\nShe whispered heaven’s so far out of reach\r\nKeep me close\r\nLike a moment you’re afraid to leave\r\nSo now this is how it feels when you’re all alone\r\nThis is how it feels when your heart starts racing\n\nYou can ask but you’ll never know\n\nThe way it feels\n\n\n\nLost and terrible\n\nHollow in ways you’ll never know\n\nIf it’s all in my head\n\nIt’s heavier now than it’s ever been\n\nSo fake a memory\n\nKeeping me quiet underneath\n\nIf this is the end\n\nDestroy everything and make it new again\n\n\n\nYou’re letting your fears stand in your way\n\nThe hardest demons that you’ll ever face\n\nHow does it feel when you’re all alone?\n\nHow does it feel when your heart starts racing?\n\nYou’re out of time, you’re out of faith\n\nThe hardest demons that you’ll ever face\n\n\n\nPull out my eyes\n\nShow me my flaws\n\nSo I can see what I’ve become\n\nCan we pretend I’m in a dream?\n\nCan’t take apart what’s incomplete\n\nI’m underneath"
