What happened? What happened?)\n\nThey hate on me now but soon I'll be winning\n\nAnd plaque and plaque, you will see it\n\nAnd they mad at my accuracy\n\nBut my swaggy flow can't even rap to the beat\n\nBetter pass it to the chief\n\nWorld is tragic and deceased\n\nCops selling crack in the street\n\nBut you look like the law\n\nI know I broke your heart but I loved you from the start\n\nBaby tell me all your secrets, baby you know this is hard\n\nWhen I'm crying in your arms, staring at the stars\n\nIt's my\n\n\n\nI knew that there would come a day\n\nWhen you would wanna\n\nYou-you would wanna\n\nYou-you would wanna run away\n\nTake you to a sonic place\n\nGirl, follow me into the ocean"
