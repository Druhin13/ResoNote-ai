  "lyrics": "In the world that you would make up\r\nWith unicorns and buffalo packs\r\nI know that you would wake up\r\nWith the sunny side touching your back\r\nIs it the lonely man of Christmas?\n\nComing up with theories on him\n\nIs it the lonely man of Christmas?\n\nHe's riding in the devil's abyss\n\n\n\nOh, I would rate the future\n\nIf I could put a finger on it\n\nBut I have no idea\n\nIf what I want is better than this\n\n\n\nIs it the lonely man of winter?\n\nI could put my finger on that\n\nIs it the lonely drive to Denver?\n\nThe loneliness of Hoppington's hat\n\n\n\nIs it the time we spent in silence?\n\nThe silence of a winter he had\n\nIs it the lonely man of winter?\n\nI could put my finger on that\n\n\n\nAnd even if it's Christmas\n\nCould we just pretend for a bit\n\nThat everything we went through\n\nWas someone else's carpenter kiss"
