  "lyrics": "You're smiling at me\r\nFrom your picture frame\r\nAnd I miss you\r\nMy life keeps on changing\r\nBut you stay the same\r\nI miss you\n\nSo many moments\n\nThat we should have shared\n\nI miss you\n\n\n\nAnd the days turn to years\n\nAnd it hasn't stopped yet\n\nThe memories we shared\n\nI will never forget\n\nNo I will never forget\n\n\n\nThere's a hole in my heart\n\nThat will never be filled\n\nI miss you\n\nThis all should get easier\n\nBut it never will\n\nI miss you\n\nI float through the days\n\nAnd the long lonely nights\n\nI miss you\n\n\n\nAnd I hear your footsteps\n\nYou're coming down the stairs\n\nLost in your laughter\n\nThe sun in your hair\n\nA brief recollection\n\nThe light in your eyes\n\nI see the reflection\n\nBut it passes by\n\nIt passes me by\n\n\n\nYou're smiling at me\n\nFrom your picture frame\n\nAnd I miss you\n\nEvery morning I wake up\n\nAnd I whisper your name\n\nI miss you\n\nYou're in faces of people\n\nI see on the street\n\nYou're everywhere\n\nYou're everywhere\n\nYou're everywhere"
