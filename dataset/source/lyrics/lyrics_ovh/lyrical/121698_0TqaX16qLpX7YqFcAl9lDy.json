Tonight? What's the difference?\n\nAs long as we feel like we're living\n\n\n\nSomething about you makes me feel alive\n\nThe only one who makes the dark turn to light\n\nAnd I can't go back after what we had\n\nForever? Tonight? What's the difference?\n\nAs long as we feel like we're living\n\n\n\nSomething about you, something about you, whoa, whoa\n\nSomething about you, something about you, whoa, whoa\n\n\n\nWe're standing real close\n\nI'm needing you the most\n\nIt's like you read my mind\n\nAnd you know that I\n\nLove those pants that you cuff like you do\n\nWith those white no shows and Adidas shoes\n\n\n\n'Cause I've learnt to enjoy the little things\n\nAnd right now, I think you'd be good with me\n\nLet's take on the night, just the both of us\n\nNo growing up, yeah, no one's in a rush\n\nDon't care where we are, cause you're perfect\n\nAnd you make me feel like it's worth it\n\nForever? Tonight? What's the difference?\n\nAs long as we feel like we're living\n\n\n\nSomething about you makes me feel alive\n\nThe only one who makes the dark turn to light\n\nAnd I can't go back after what we had\n\nForever? Tonight? What's the difference?\n\nAs long as we feel like we're living\n\n\n\nSomething about you makes me feel alive\n\nThe only one who makes the dark turn to light\n\nAnd I can't go back after what we had\n\nForever? Tonight? What's the difference?\n\nAs long as we feel like we're living\n\n\n\nSomething about you\n\nSomething about you\n\nSomething about you makes me feel ali-\n\nThe only one who makes the dark turn to light\n\nAnd I can't go back after what we had\n\nForever? Tonight? What's the difference?\n\nAs long as we feel like we're living\n\n(Just as long as we feel like we're living)"
