  "lyrics": "Stalled in the mid' of my street\r\nI'm needing some clarity\r\nAnd I carve the radio, to find a song like you\r\nOh no I'm not looking back, to rewrite our story's past\r\nI gave up years ago\n\nAnd as guarded as I am, I've got things I've left unsaid\n\nI'm not a kid\n\n\n\nI'm living in the shade of my mind, I just stop for a second, and baby I reason\n\nI move forward like the seasons\n\n\n\nThat season ends, then another begins\n\nI'm still chasing me, finding who I am\n\nI am 21 feel like I'm over and done\n\nMost days I've lost, some nights I've won\n\nNo drug that can change me, no one who can make me\n\nI made myself and I should know that well\n\nThat night off I-44, thought it was the end\n\nI wish he would love me in the way that I loved him\n\n\n\nI'm not looking back, to rewrite my fucking past\n\nI gave up years ago\n\nAnd as guarded as I am, I've got things I've left unsaid\n\nI'm not a kid\n\n\n\nI move forward like the seasons\n\nForward, forward, forward"
