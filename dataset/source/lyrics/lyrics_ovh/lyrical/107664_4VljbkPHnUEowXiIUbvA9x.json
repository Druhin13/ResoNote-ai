  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Cheer For The Elves par Gwen Stefani\r\nThey got good hearts\nWith the burning desire to work hard\nThey don’t even get tired\nNever try to get a taste of the spotlight\nNo, they only wanna make Santa shine bright\n\nIn the workshop\nMaking cookies and candy with Mrs. Claus\nWhile Santa’s sippin’ brandy\nAnd they don’t even mind that it’s so cold\n'Cause they love living life in the North Pole\n\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves\nThey do like nobody else\nWorkin' all day and all night\nTo make your wish come alive\n\nMakin' dolls, makin' trains, makin' model airplanes\nHelping Santa with a smile on their face\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves (hey)\nA cheer for the elves\n\nIn the mailroom\nThey read every letter that was sent through\nAnd no matter the weather they always make sure Santa gets out\nAnd he gets every single last gift out\n\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves\nThey do like nobody else\nWorkin' all day and all night\nTo make your wish come alive\nMakin' dolls, makin' trains, makin' model airplanes\n\nHelping Santa with a smile on their face\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves (hey)\nA cheer for the elves\n\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\nMaking dolls, making trains, making model airplanes\nHelping Santa with a smile on their face\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves\nA cheer for the elves\n\n(Hip Hip, Hooray!\nHip Hip!\nHip Hip, Hooray!\n\nHip Hip!)\n\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves\nThey do like nobody else\nWorking all day and all night\nTo make your wish come alive\nMaking dolls, making trains, making model airplanes\nHelping Santa with a smile on their face\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves\nA cheer for the elves\n\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\nFa-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\nMaking dolls, making trains, making model airplanes\n\nHelping Santa with a smile on their face\nLet’s give a cheer for the elves\nA cheer for the elves"
