  "lyrics": "We don't wanna believe it, that it’s all gone\r\nJust a matter of minutes, before the sun goes down\r\nWe're afraid to admit it, but I know you know, know that\r\nWe should've known better, we kept on trying\r\nI just stand now and see it, the fire’s dying out\r\nCan't believe that I see this, we're out of chances now\n\nAnd I just want you to know that\n\n\n\nYou and me it was good but it wasn't right\n\nAnd it'll be hard but I know I will make it out\n\nStep by step, I'll move on and get on with life\n\nSo I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now\n\nYou and me it was good but it wasn't right\n\nAnd it’ll be hard but I know I will make it out\n\nStep by step I’ll move on and get on with life\n\nSo I let go, and I hope you'll be happy now\n\n\n\nI hope you’ll be happy now\n\nYeah, I hope you'll be happy now\n\nI hope you'll be happy now\n\nYeah, I hope you'll be happy now\n\nYeah, I hope you’ll be happy now\n\nI hope you'll be happy now\n\n\n\nThought we would make it, if I just held on\n\nBut it's really crazy, how love could fade so fast\n\nWe said \"forever\", but now we're in the past\n\nAnd I just want you to know that\n\n\n\nYou and me it was good but it wasn't right\n\nAnd it'll be hard but I know I will make it out\n\nStep by step I'll move on and get on with life\n\nSo I let go and I hope you'll be happy now\n\nYou and me it was good but it wasn't right\n\nAnd it'll be hard but I know I will make it out\n\nStep by step I'll move on and get on with life\n\nSo I let go and I hope you'll be happy now\n\n\n\nYeah, I hope you'll be happy now\n\nI hope you'll be happy now\n\nI hope you'll be happy now\n\nI hope you'll be happy now"
