  "lyrics": "You may not mind that it's over\r\nBut I've a different point of view\r\nEven though I am shattered\r\nIt's easy for you\r\nYou don't have to face the music\n\nYou don't have to face the crowd\n\nJust go back where you came from\n\nYou ain't even proud\n\n\n\nI had a wife and I had children\n\nI threw them all away\n\nAnd now you tell me, you dare to tell me\n\nI should go back to them\n\nWhat do you think I should say\n\n\n\nI found it hard to leave them\n\nSaddest thing I ever had to do\n\nMy problems haven't started\n\nAnd it's easy for you\n\n\n\nI had a wife and I had children\n\nI threw them all away\n\nAnd now you tell me, you dare to tell me\n\nI should go back to them\n\nWhat do you think, what on earth do you think I should say\n\n\n\nIf you ever tire of the good life\n\nCall me in a year or two\n\nI've got no choice, I'll forgive you\n\n'Cause it's easy for you\n\n\n\nYou only have to call me, it's easy for you\n\nYou only have to call me, it's easy for you"
