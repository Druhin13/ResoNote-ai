  "lyrics": "The city looks pretty when you been indoors\r\nFor 23 days I've ignored all your phone calls\r\nAnd everyone's waiting when you get back home\r\nThey don't know where you been, why you gone so long\r\nFriends treat you like a stranger and\r\nStrangers treat you like their best friend, oh well\n\nSpare a thought for the ones that came before\n\nAll in a daze bending backwards to reach your goal\n\n\n\nSometimes I get sad\n\nIt's not all that bad\n\nOne day, maybe never\n\nI'll come around\n\n\n\nThe city takes pity on your injured soul\n\nAnd heavenly prose ain't enough good to fill that hole\n\nEveryone's soaked in animosity\n\nIt's vicious in winter, you never say what you mean\n\nFriends treat you like a stranger and\n\nStrangers treat you like their best friend, oh well\n\nWakin' up to another dismal day\n\nYou got a ways to go, you oughta be grateful\n\n\n\nSometimes I get mad\n\nIt's not half as bad\n\nPull yourself together\n\nAnd just calm down\n\n\n\nI'll be what you want oh when you want it\n\nBut I'll never be what you need\n\nAnd the city looks pretty from where I'm standing..."
