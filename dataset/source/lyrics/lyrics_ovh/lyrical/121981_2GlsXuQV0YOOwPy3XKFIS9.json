  "lyrics": "I've learned to slam on the brake\r\nBefore I even turn the key\r\nBefore I make the mistake\r\nBefore I lead with the worst of me\r\nGive them no reason to stare\n\nNo slippin' up if you slip away\n\nSo I got nothing to share\n\nNo, I got nothing to say\n\n\n\nStep out, step out of the sun\n\nIf you keep getting burned\n\nStep out, step out of the sun\n\nBecause you've learned, because you've learned\n\n\n\nOn the outside, always looking in\n\nWill I ever be more than I've always been?\n\n'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass\n\nI'm waving through a window\n\nI try to speak, but nobody can hear\n\nSo I wait around for an answer to appear\n\nWhile I'm watch, watch, watching people pass\n\nI'm waving through a window, oh\n\nCan anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?\n\n\n\nWe start with stars in our eyes\n\nWe start believing that we belong\n\nBut every sun doesn't rise\n\nAnd no one tells you where you went wrong\n\n\n\nStep out, step out of the sun\n\nIf you keep getting burned\n\nStep out, step out of the sun\n\nBecause you've learned, because you've learned\n\n\n\nOn the outside, always looking in\n\nWill I ever be more than I've always been?\n\n'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass\n\nWaving through a window\n\nI try to speak, but nobody can hear\n\nSo I wait around for an answer to appear\n\nWhile I'm watch, watch, watching people pass\n\nWaving through a window, oh\n\nCan anybody see, is anybody waving?\n\n\n\nWhen you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around\n\nDo you ever really crash, or even make a sound?\n\nWhen you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around\n\nDo you ever really crash, or even make a sound?\n\nWhen you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around\n\nDo you ever really crash, or even make a sound?\n\nWhen you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around\n\nDo you ever really crash, or even make a sound?\n\nDid I even make a sound?\n\nDid I even make a sound?\n\nIt's like I never made a sound\n\nWill I ever make a sound?\n\n\n\nOn the outside, always looking in\n\nWill I ever be more than I've always been?\n\n'Cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass\n\nWaving through a window, oh\n\nI try to speak, but nobody can hear\n\nSo I wait around for an answer to appear\n\nWhile I'm watch, watch, watching people pass\n\nWaving through a window, oh\n\nCan anybody see, is anybody waving back at me? (Ooh)\n\n\n\nIs anybody waving?\n\nWaving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh"
