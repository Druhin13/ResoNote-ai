  "lyrics": "Somewhere down the way, there's a hidden place that anyone\r\nThat all of us could find\r\nBut our maps have failed, so venture through the veil and realize\r\nThat these roads are intertwined\r\nFar beyond those walls, gleaming black and white\n\nFurther than our false schemes of wrong and right\n\nIs a field where we can walk\n\nLeaving all our names behind\n\n\n\nI will meet you there, beyond the pines\n\nTempled in twilight or dawn\n\nThe light and easy air\n\nTracing the lines on our palms\n\n\n\nSomewhere down the road is a place that we can go where everyone\n\nAnd everything is divine\n\nAnd when we're all awake, we can finally make and end of these\n\nDivisions in our minds\n\n\n\nFar beyond those walls, gleaming black and white\n\nFurther than our false schemes of wrong and right\n\nIs a field where we can walk\n\nLeaving all our names behind\n\n\n\nI will meet you there, beyond the pines\n\nTempled in twilight or dawn\n\nThe light and easy air\n\nTracing the lines on our palms\n\n\n\nAnd I will meet you there - don't go to sleep\n\nOur souls and feet both bare - with grass beneath\n\nThe oaths we needn't swear are vast and deep\n\nOur breath will be our prayer - alone - complete\n\n\n\nI will meet you there, beyond the pines\n\nTempled in twilight or dawn\n\nThe light and easy air\n\nTracing the lines on our palms"
