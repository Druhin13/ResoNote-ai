  "lyrics": "We went to the meadow\r\nNo walls, no ads, no black balloons\r\nWaving from the chain link fence\r\nNo bricks, no windows\r\nExcept for the two gold ones\r\nYou showed me, my friend\n\nWe went to the meadow\n\n\n\nAnd we knew it wouldn't last\n\nIt was beautiful\n\n\n\nWe went to the meadow\n\nNo fear, no confusion, just a sliver of a moon\n\nCheering us from out in the blue\n\nNo hate, just springâ€™s young light green leaves\n\nShowing us what life can do\n\nWe went to the meadow\n\nWe went to the meadow\n\n\n\nAnd we knew it wouldn't last\n\nIt was beautiful\n\nWe knew it wouldn't last\n\nIt was beautiful\n\n\n\nWe went to the meadow\n\nWe went to the meadow"
