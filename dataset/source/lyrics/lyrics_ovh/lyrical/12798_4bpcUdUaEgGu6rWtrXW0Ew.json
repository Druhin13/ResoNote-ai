  "lyrics": "All I know is something like a bird within her sang,\r\nAll I know she sang a little while and then flew on,\r\nTell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain.\r\nIf you hear that same sweet song again, will you know why?\r\nAnyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin' by,\n\nLaugh in the sunshine, sing, cry in the dark, fly through the night.\n\n\n\nDon't cry now, don't you cry, don't you cry anymore.\n\nSleep in the stars, don't you cry, dry your eyes on the wind.\n\n\n\nAll I know is something like a bird within her sang,\n\nAll I know she sang a little while and then flew off,\n\nTell me all that you know, I'll show you snow and rain"
