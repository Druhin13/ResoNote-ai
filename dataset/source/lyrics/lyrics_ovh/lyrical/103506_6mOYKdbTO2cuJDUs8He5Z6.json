  "lyrics": "Take your time to come my way I can see what I've been missing\r\nI will live in fantasy where I never have to listen\r\nDo you explain how I'm doing wrong and I'm simply not enough\r\nProbably not what you even said but this heartbreak's gone, this heartbreak's gone to my head\r\nI'm feeling fine almost every day except for all the time, all the time\n\nDon't have enough energy to even go outside, go outside (and cry anymore)\n\nI've dropped my insecurities I left my dignity on the floor\n\nBut you'll pick it up again for me or will there never be a once more\n\n\n\nI feel like on fire, you sit back and smile\n\nTo lend me my brain when I'm running the show\n\n\n\nI've given up\n\nI've really really given up\n\nBut it's just to get to you\n\nOh this feels like\n\n\n\nI feel like on fire, you sit back and smile\n\nTo lend me my brain when I'm running the show"
