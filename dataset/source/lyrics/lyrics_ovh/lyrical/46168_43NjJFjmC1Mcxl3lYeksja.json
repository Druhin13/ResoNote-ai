  "lyrics": "Impossible for me to explain.\r\nDo you justice and keep it restrained.\r\nIt's what I need to say to you.\r\nSeems like you've broken your heart,\r\nSeems like things are falling apart\r\nAll around you.\n\n\n\nFirst, it's complication, now it's just too quiet.\n\nI don't know the reason, know you'll never buy it.\n\nIt's hard to wait. Yeah, it's hard to wait.\n\nNext, is my frustration of why you're letting go.\n\nI'll hold you 'til it's over, so that you will know she\n\nFeels no pain. Yeah, she feels no pain.\n\n\n\nClose your eyes and let it all go.\n\nI'll tell you when it's over and it's done.\n\nJust being here for her until she's gone.\n\n\n\nNo one knows what to say.\n\nRemember when things were ok?\n\nBut it's not ok.\n\n\n\nNow's the hesitation. Did we even try?\n\nWhere are my emotions? All I do is cry.\n\nSomeone please explain, someone please explain.\n\n\n\nHere's a confrontation between me and the sky.\n\nI'm screaming up to god you, you better tell me why.\n\nIs this all in vain, was this all in vain?\n\n\n\nClose my eyes and let it all go.\n\nSomeone tell me when it's over and it's done.\n\nShe was everything and now everything's gone."
