  "lyrics": "I found him lying there on the floor\r\nHe did not breathe\r\nLooked around but to my chagrin\r\nI was surrounded\r\nBy a scene of morbid despair (suffering souls)\r\nAnd I waited for the knife to find me\n\n\n\nBut luckily I was alone\n\nEscape, pretend you were never here\n\n\n\nI run, make sure there's no one around\n\nDon't make a sound\n\nI beg my body to stay off of the ground\n\nOh, do you realize just what you've done\n\nOh, I knew\n\nWill I ever mention her name\n\n\n\nI am a coward but I'm alive\n\nI am so sorry I'm still alive\n\n\n\nSo I go back\n\nI taste the horror\n\nI stare blankly, don't know where to begin\n\nThe smell consumes me\n\nOne by one I cover them all (say my goodbyes)\n\nThen I slowly find my way into the night\n\n\n\nOnly this time I'm not alone\n\nYou had your chance but it's over now\n\n\n\nI run, make sure there's no one around\n\nDon't make a sound\n\nI beg my body to stay off of the ground\n\nOh, do you realize just what you've done\n\nOh, I knew\n\nWill I ever mention her name\n\n\n\nI am a coward but I'm alive\n\nI am so sorry I'm still alive\n\n\n\nI'm begging you please let me go\n\nI'll pretend I did not see a thing\n\nRip out my tongue, yea\n\nLet me go\n\nAnd I'll tell them you were never here\n\nI'll swear to them that it was me\n\n\n\nI run, make sure there's no one around\n\nDon't make a sound\n\nI beg my body to stay off of the ground\n\nOh, do you realize just what you've done\n\nOh, I knew\n\nWill I ever mention her name\n\n\n\nI am a coward but I'm alive\n\nI am so sorry I'm still alive\n\nI am a bastard but I'm alive\n\nI'm so sorry for what I've done"
