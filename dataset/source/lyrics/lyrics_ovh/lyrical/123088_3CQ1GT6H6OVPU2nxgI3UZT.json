  "lyrics": "I've been coolin' out, baby\r\nNow I might be fool enough, maybe\r\nAnd now I wanna hear you say it\r\nSay that love ain't enough to carry\r\nNow it might be that I'm bein' swayed in a lie\n\nAre you standing in the shadows or standing in the waves?\n\nThe heat's got you dizzy and you're red in the face\n\nWarm summer breeze, but it's cold at my place\n\nI feel the rhythm and you're on the chase\n\n\n\nI said, baby, come on\n\nWe'll be dancin' and havin' fun\n\nTell your mama that you're leavin' home\n\nAnd your friends are gonna come along\n\n\n\nAnd I've been coolin' out, baby\n\nAnd I hope to hear you say it\n\nBaby, it's not broke, not mendin'\n\nAnd you can't always catch it, baby\n\nLine me a hook, sing me a song\n\nFind me crooked, broken and wrong\n\nI found myself in the way\n\n\n\nI said, baby, come on\n\nWe'll be dancin' and havin' fun\n\nTell your mama that you're leavin' home\n\nAnd your friends are gonna come along\n\nWe'll be coolin' and carryin' on\n\n\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby\n\nI've been coolin' out, baby"
