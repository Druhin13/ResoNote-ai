(Are we?)\r\nIt's so hatr to tell when nobody's breathing\r\nHolding your chest (your chest)\r\nUntil we (until we)\r\nIt's so tired that we get what we were raised\n\nI know that you're right (you're right)\n\nEverytime (everytime)\n\nBut I fight it cause that's just what I like, yeah\n\nI think you're the best (the best)\n\nShould we? (Should we?)\n\nLeaving far when everyone's sleeping\n\n\n\nAnd I caught up to your tight suit\n\nCaught up, caught up to [?]\n\nI went up to your bedroom\n\nWe were joking high, I wish I never met you\n\n\n\nWhen I was 5, I talked too much\n\nThen I was 10, I think I started losing my touch\n\nAnother reason that you'll never find me\n\nI come home every night, it's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nIt's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\n\n\nI'm loving our days, in LA\n\nYou get so excited when we seat in the same jet\n\nAnd I forget to pay, for a drink\n\nNext thing you know, I'm opened running away, yeah\n\nThe loop hops overhead, are we dead?\n\nYou just get me like I'm something you read\n\nI'm loving our days, in LA\n\nLet's check our wallets when we're waiting for our change\n\n\n\nAnd I caught up to your tight suit\n\nCaught up, caught up to [?]\n\nI went up to your bedroom\n\nWe were joking high, I wish I never made it\n\n\n\nWhen I was 5, I talked too much\n\nThen I was 10, I think I started losing my touch\n\nAnother reason that you'll never find me\n\nI come home every night, it's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nIt's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\n\n\nIs it the time, is it the time to be okay?\n\n'cause I'm thinking that we should be lift high\n\nIt's a good time to be okay\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nWhen I was 5, I talked too much\n\nThen I was 10, I think I started losing my touch\n\nAnother reason that you'll never find me\n\nI come home every night, it's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nIt's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\n\n\nIt's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nIt's just me and my friends\n\nMe and my friends\n\nMe and my friends"
