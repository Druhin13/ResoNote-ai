  "lyrics": "Through the hills, and mountaintops\r\nFrom moonlight to dewdrops\r\nDanced around until the morning sunlight came\r\nWhen the sun had reached the sky\r\nWe almost wished that we would die\r\nSo we'd never have to see this moment's end\n\n\n\nStaring out the window pane as midnight turns to dawn\n\nHolding on to moments fading fast, forever gone\n\nLet's pretend the sun won't rise and dance until the morn\n\nPlease don't go\n\n\n\nYou hold me like a mother's child and treat me with a lie\n\nThat when the night is over, everything will be alright\n\nSo I kiss you underneath the stars\n\nWhile tears are falling from our eyes\n\nI won't let go, you should know\n\n\n\nIf I could write you a love song\n\nIt would go on and on, and on, and on\n\n'Cause I see forever in your arms\n\nSo keep on holding on and on, and on, and on, and on\n\n\n\nWondering when the winds will let me see your face again\n\nHolding hope, but we both know that this might be the end\n\nWish for the moon as the light shines through\n\nAnd the skies are glowing red\n\nI won't let go, you should know\n\n\n\nIf I could write you a love song\n\nIt would go on and on, and on, and on\n\n'Cause I see forever in your arms\n\nSo keep on holding on and on, and on, and on, and on\n\n\n\n[?]\n\n\n\nIf I could write you a love song\n\nIt would go on and on, and on, and on\n\n'Cause I see forever in your arms\n\nSo keep on holding on and on, and on, and on, and on"
