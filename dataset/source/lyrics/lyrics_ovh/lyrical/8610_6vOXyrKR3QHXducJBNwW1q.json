  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Shameless Shadow par The Garden\r\nI wake up\nTake each step as slow as I can\nTell my self that I'm the man\nI got minutes, I got hours, I got seconds\nAnd I'm blowing it\nShowing up late with nothing to show for it\n\nVada vada\n\nYou can have it if you want it\nAll that comes to mind when I hear you is\nWhat the flip you thinking bud\nYa got everything you need to break the mold\nYa had all the damn time in the world\nSo tell me what the flip you thinking bud\nSo tell me what the flip you thinking bud\n\n\nGive it a few minutes I'm not feeling sly\nIf you got a second, buy it for a dime\nBuild my own waste stacking pretty high\nI'm my own problem, not a solid guy\n\nGive it a few minutes I'm not feeling sly\nIf you got a second, buy it for a dime\nBuild my own waste stacking pretty high\nI'm my own problem, not a solid guy\n\nWholesome qualities are what I might possess\nMy shadow has a different vibe than my nose has\nAnd that's a fact\nI serve as an example of a something that's almost right\nFixable, mixable, sitting in plain ol' sight\n\n\nYou can have it if you want it\nAll that comes to mind when I hear you is\nWhat the flip you thinking bud\nYa got everything you need to break the mold\nYa had all the damn time in the world\nSo tell me what the flip you thinking bud\nSo tell me what the flip you thinking bud"
