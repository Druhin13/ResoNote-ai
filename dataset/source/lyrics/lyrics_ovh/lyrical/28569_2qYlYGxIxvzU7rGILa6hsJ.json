  "lyrics": "You don't know what love is\r\n'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues\r\nUntil you've loved a love you've had to lose,\r\nYou don't know what love is.\r\nYou don't know how lips hurt\n\nUntil you've kissed and had to pay the cost,\n\nUntil you've flipped your heart and you have lost,\n\nYou don't know what love is.\n\n\n\nDo you know how a lost heart fears\n\nAt the thought of reminiscing,\n\nAnd how lips that taste of tears\n\nLose their taste for kissing?\n\nYou don't know how hearts burn\n\nFor love that can, not live yet never dies.\n\nUntil you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,\n\nYou don't know what love is."
