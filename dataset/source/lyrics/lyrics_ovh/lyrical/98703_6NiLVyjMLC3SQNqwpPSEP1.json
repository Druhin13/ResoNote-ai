  "lyrics": "Aiming soft steps along each brick to give respect in the places unfit\r\nIt’s not a waste to him, but all he knows; avoiding all the conflict to seek some repose\r\nThinking back on his father's words to try and mend the cracks at the seams\r\nStand your ground and speak your mind; a unity he can’t emphasize\r\nHard rain falls without consulting the flood\n\nA tear hits the cheek of a heartless man\n\nCounting the minutes as you lose control\n\nThis love goes unreceived, marked “return to sender”\n\n\n\nFeeling it all around me; watching the clouds roll over\n\nFall into place; trust in the outcome\n\nWalk along the path of least resistance\n\n\n\nSet your feet to paths for you to wander, and never feel alone Questioning the option to surrender, embracing the unknown on\n\nYour own\n\n\n\nWalk alone or lead the pack (on your own); there’s no difference in numbers if you see nothing with eyes wide open\n\nRemembering moments being led astray, the howling voices looming close behind, reaching for a piece to steal away\n\nClose your doors, even if the rooms are vacant\n\n\n\nSet your feet to paths for you to wander, and never feel alone Questioning the option to surrender, embracing the unknown\n\n\n\nSetting all the clocks to prior hours to stagger fleeting time; saving all the love you can remember, remember\n\nThinking back on his father's words to try and mend the cracks at\n\nThe seams\n\nStand your ground and speak your mind; a unity he can’t emphasize"
