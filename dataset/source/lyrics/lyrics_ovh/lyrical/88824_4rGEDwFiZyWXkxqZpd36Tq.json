  "lyrics": "We met on a Saturday in the summer breeze [?]\r\nWe stayed up late on a movie date\r\nYou watching it and I was watching you\r\nThere's something 'bout you that gets me feeling some way\r\nI'd tell you everything but if you knew, would you stay?\n\n\n\nYou have no idea how beautiful you are\n\nI swear that everyday you're breaking peoples hearts\n\nSometimes when you're with me I can't help but wonder\n\nCan't help but wonder\n\nThat if you could see what I could see\n\nYou'd probably be mean\n\n\n\nYou'd be in a car with him\n\nRiding to the football game\n\nOr passing me in the hallways\n\nWhen you're on your way with no words to say\n\n\n\nThere's something 'bout you that gets me feeling some way\n\nI'd tell you everything but if you knew, would you stay?\n\n\n\nYou have no idea how beautiful you are\n\nI swear that everyday you're breaking peoples hearts\n\nSometimes when you're with me I can't help but wonder\n\nCan't help but wonder\n\nThat if you could see what I could see\n\nYou'd probably\n\n\n\nYou even look better than tan in my sweater\n\nDidn't think it was possible\n\nThe streetlights are your stage\n\nYou're perfect in all ways\n\nIf you ever realise\n\nThat if you could see what I could see\n\nYou'd probably\n\n\n\nYou have no idea how beautiful you are\n\nI swear that everyday you're breaking peoples hearts\n\nSometimes when you're with me I can't help but wonder\n\nCan't help but wonder\n\nThat if you could see what I could see\n\nYou'd probably be mean"
