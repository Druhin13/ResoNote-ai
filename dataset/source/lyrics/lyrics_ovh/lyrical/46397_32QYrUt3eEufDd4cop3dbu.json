  "lyrics": "Someday I'll be gone\r\nTo somewhere that we belong\r\nAnd God has never played his role\r\n'Cause I'm the one who saves my soul\r\nIt's a perfect world we're longing for\r\nSo long...\n\n\n\nCursed shadows haunt and gather\n\nIn the city of no answer\n\nAs we follow endless questions\n\nHands up in the same reflection\n\n\n\nSometimes we try to feel how things just used to be in yesterdays\n\nNo one ever make it better, no one ever lives forever\n\nWake me up and let me go\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be gone\n\nTo somewhere we all belong\n\nFor so long\n\n\n\nBroken people, broken feelings\n\nFeeling numb but know they're bleeding\n\nLight and darkness bond together\n\nFaith will save you \n\nYeah, whatever...\n\n\n\nSometimes we try to feel how things just used to be in yesterdays\n\nBut never seem to believe in what we see today\n\nNo one ever make it better, no one ever lives forever\n\nWake me up and let me go\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be gone\n\nTo somewhere we all belong\n\nAnd God has never played his role\n\n'Cause I'm the one who saves my soul\n\nIt's a perfect world we're longing for\n\n\n\nWon't you...\n\n\n\nShow me the light? How far will you go?\n\nFor a vengeance in this wasted world that we know\n\nTo sleep in silence\n\nWe need to laugh again\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll be gone (Someday I'll be)\n\nTo somewhere we all belong\n\nYeah...\n\n\n\nSomeday we'll be gone (Someday we'll be)\n\nTo somewhere we all belong\n\nAnd God has never played his role\n\n'Cause I'm the one who saves my soul\n\nThe perfect world we're longing for\n\n\n\nSo long"
