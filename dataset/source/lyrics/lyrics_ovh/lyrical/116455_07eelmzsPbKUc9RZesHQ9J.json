  "lyrics": "All that I see is beautiful faces\r\nSmiling at me from the darkest of places\r\nPraying for love with a gun in their hands\r\nCan you comprehend?\r\nWe're already dead so\n\n(Give it up) Can you put it down?\n\n(Live it up) Until you’re buried underground\n\n(Pick it up) If you’re not too proud\n\n(Live it up) Until you’re buried underground\n\n\n\nAll that I hear is innocent voices\n\nSinging to free themselves from their choices\n\nPraying for light with their heads in the sand\n\nDo you understand?\n\nThis is just how it ends so\n\n\n\n(Give it up) Can you put it down?\n\n(Live it up) Until you’re buried underground\n\n(Pick it up) If you’re not too proud\n\n(Live it up) Until you’re buried underground\n\n\n\n(Give it up) Can you put it down?\n\n(Live it up) Until you’re buried underground\n\n(Pick it up) If you’re not too proud\n\n(Live it up) Until you’re buried underground\n\n\n\nAll that I see is beautiful faces\n\nSmiling at me and talking of freedom\n\nRacing around to secure their places\n\nPleading their cases\n\nThey’re too scared to face it"
