  "lyrics": "New York release me from my strata\r\nThe morning streams out an afterbirth of Vodka\r\nThe dream of Julian Casablancas\r\nGyro salesman and a stranger in my blanket\r\nAwoken by drones\n\nAmazon drones\n\nDrones\n\n\n\nI wake up in the flies and filth\n\nThat used to hold some truth in this town they built\n\nOh, I wake up from a champagne dream\n\nWhere I can blow my mind and forget about what's tearing me\n\nI wake up in a chaise lounge of cans\n\nEvian bottle filled with urine in my right hand\n\nNow we all wake from our champagne dreams\n\nWhere truth is sudden north and we're all just what we seem, seem, seem"
