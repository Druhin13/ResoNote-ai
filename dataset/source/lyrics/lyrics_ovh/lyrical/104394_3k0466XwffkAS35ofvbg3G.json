Acting like I'm normal, like I don't realise I made it, like I don't realise I'm famous\n\nLike I don't realise everytime I walk around the city, they look at me like the greatest\n\nAll-time hated nigga, put me in your playlist\n\nTrunk on the front of McLaren's that need a waitlist\n\nSo when I back, back, I'm frontin' on fuck niggas, that told me I'll never made it, in my Audemar Piguet wrist\n\nI hop the plane in sweats and the bathing ape kicks, 50 pointer bracelets, man's best fragrance\n\nI'm still ballin', these foul niggas is still flagrant\n\nI ain't got no business talkin' just to build statement\n\nSee the life from a faraway\n\nI still feel close on the nights when I'm far away\n\nI comin' home, workin' at nights to a hard day\n\nTryin' to avoid nights in the hallway selling hard ye\n\nBack when you was hip-hoppin' and watchin' Kanye\n\nI was coach hoppin' and sleepin' inside a Hyundai\n\nMade bands out of any floor, at your mom place\n\nTryna duck the crime rate, where the fuck was my mindstate?\n\nI cry real tears thinkin' bout my mom face\n\nIf she was here, I'm thinkin', what would my mom say?\n\nShe'd say, I'm well accomplished, she'd say I really did it, she said don't let her settle for no penny pincher\n\nI, will not lose, no, I refuse niggas\n\nI, 2 plus 2 niggas, I school niggas\n\nShe wanna get high, fuck with a cool nigga\n\n48 floors, check out my view nigga\n\nUh, I already know the outcome\n\nI may have fucked it up with Nicki right before this album\n\nMy ex on me like Malcolm, she know we can't be together, but still be asking me how come? I know the shit crazy\n\nMy life upgraded and I ain't going backwards\n\nClosest thing going backwards is me rollin' Backwoods\n\nLooking at you niggas like there's no more factors\n\nUntil the story over like there's no more chapters\n\nFargo"
