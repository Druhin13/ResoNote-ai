Then jeez\n\nRelax, take a seat, kick back\n\nI'm Top Chef, the shit is simple as Easy Mac\n\nThe demon's back\n\nSwing until my femur snaps\n\nI got the energy levels of taking speed with crack\n\nThe beaten path was not for me, I went left\n\nStepped in the ring and duked shit to death\n\nI came to impress, you came to get wrecked\n\nWhen I flex, I'ma shake your brain with chin checks\n\nAnd a broken nose and go blow for blow\n\nToe to toe\n\nI hoped you that you know the ropes\n\nI've been against that wall like the shoulder closed\n\nBut I rose up, evolved, and I chose my road\n\nAnd it's safe to say that they will never give me my props\n\nSo I'm dropping non-stop\n\nGot my lane on lock\n\nI flow hard as rock\n\nLike I trained with Brock\n\nThe hype is real, I'm about to go crazy watch\n\nThey can't tame me or play me on radio\n\nI'm too real in a game full of fakes and so\n\nI go in, never let the devil take my soul\n\nI'm swinging Valyrian steel and break the mold\n\nYou better listen what Christian be putting them in submission\n\nI'm ripping with precision until they gon' put me in prison\n\nFor killing everything that entered my vision\n\nWeapons I'm grippin, and every incision\n\nI put all my enemies with 'em\n\nThen you know I'm about to hop in the Chevy (skrt skrt)\n\nAnd I'm pulling up with Tommy Vercetti\n\nYou gonna need a cheat code if you're copying Webby\n\n'Cause I'm wanted with 5 stars with a body already\n\nAsk Xan how he felt from the wrath of Chris\n\nHe broke down, took a key, and he scratched his whip\n\nAnd then waved the white flag, said \"I've had it, shit\n\nI just sent a couple tweets, I ain't ask for this!\"\n\nBut it's all in good fun, no beef lil homie\n\nIt was just a lesson that I teach, lil homie\n\nOf what not to say when you speak, lil homie\n\nAnd uh, I gotta practice what I preach lil homie\n\nWhich is if you come at me, I'll go at you\n\nTimes two\n\nNow they all know that's true\n\nI'ma rise through the ranks and fill up my piggy bank\n\nIn a house on a hill with the Kodak view\n\nWhen I'm getting where I'm going I can sit and chill\n\nAnd stop killing everything in my peripheral\n\nGladiator on the mic is how I'm built for real\n\nSo put them cards on the table like we split the bill\n\nThe kid is ill\n\nI'm still in my monster mode\n\nSo vamanos\n\nBe gone, yo it's time to go\n\nFind me in the Northeast like a lobster roll\n\nThrowing middle fingers up to the cop patrols\n\nYou see Webby's always wide awake\n\nSo you just better ride away\n\nAnd find a hiding place where you can hide away\n\nSo shut your mouth like the entire race\n\nOf aliens from that movie A Quiet Place\n\nAre creeping right in through your fucking fireplace\n\nYeah, what I drop is easy\n\nTo write, I just need a little pot, believe me\n\nThe type with red hairs like Ronald Weasley\n\nAnd the purple on it like Waluigi\n\nGod damn, what you think I'm spazzing for?\n\nA motherfucker, bitch I'm why your mom and dad divorced\n\nI'll crash the Porsche\n\nRight up into the package store\n\nTake everything, dip, come back, and ask for more\n\nBack and forth\n\nOn my grind, til I'm getting to the pie\n\nBut this game has gone wack\n\nI'm really not surprised\n\nGot a whole generation yelling \"Cash me outside\"\n\nSqueezing motherfucking lemons in their eyes\n\nBut until the fat lady sings on Broadway\n\nDon't know how much that broad weigh\n\nBut she hit them a cappellas all day\n\nA renegade, part Shady and part Jay\n\nAnd part Tasmanian devil raising hell in the hallways\n\nSo play my tape until the decks are blown out\n\nI'm sick, hit the booth, an infection broke out\n\nVerbal semiautomatic tech that's scoped out\n\nLeave shells on the ground like at Texas Roadhouse\n\nThe top's what I'm coming for\n\nGot that magic with the flow, call me Dumbledore\n\nI got the munchies\n\nAnd all you rappers are looking like Aqua Teen Hunger Force\n\nYou don't want no motherfucking war"
