  "lyrics": "She was a level-headed dancer on the road to alcohol\r\nAnd I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal\r\nWell she pressed her chest against me\r\nAbout the time the juke box broke\r\nYeah, she gave me a peck on the back of the neck\r\nAnd these are the words she spoke\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nBlow up your TV throw away your paper\n\nGo to the country, build you a home\n\nPlant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches\n\nTry an find Jesus on your own \n\n\n\nWell, I sat there at the table and I acted real naive\n\nFor I knew that topless lady had something up her sleeve\n\nWell, she danced around the bar room and she did the hoochy-coo\n\nYeah she sang her song all night long, tellin' me what to do\n\n\n\nRepeat chorus:\n\n\n\nWell, I was young and hungry and about to leave that place\n\nWhen just as I was leavin', well she looked me in the face\n\nI said \"You must know the answer.\"\n\n\"She said, \"No but I'll give it a try.\"\n\nAnd to this very day we've been livin' our way\n\nAnd here is the reason why\n\n\n\nWe blew up our TV threw away our paper\n\nWent to the country, built us a home\n\nHad a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches\n\nThey all found Jesus on their own"
