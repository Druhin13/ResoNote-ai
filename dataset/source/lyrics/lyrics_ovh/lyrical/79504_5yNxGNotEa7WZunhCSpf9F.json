  "lyrics": "I get money from you, \nTo tickle your whim, \nOr blow up your mind,\r\nThen I give money to you, \nAnd you pay me back in kind.\r\nNow, I gave money to Bill, \n\nHe pays up my bills, \n\nAnd helps me make up my mind,\n\nAnd I give money to Bill, \n\nAnd he will be on my side.\n\nNow, I gave money to Joe,\n\nCause Bill said he knows, \n\nHe'll pay me back in time,\n\nAnd Bill's getting paid to know,\n\nIf anyone's lying.\n\nNow, Bill said give it to Hank,\n\nCause Hank owns a bank, \n\nAnd he can make it grow,\n\nNow, ain't those amazing folks,\n\nThat Bill is lucky to know?\n\nSomehow my finances will grow,\n\nWith the interest I show, \n\nIn the interest it gives me,\n\nAnd now a piece of paper from me,\n\nWon't seem half as flimsy."
