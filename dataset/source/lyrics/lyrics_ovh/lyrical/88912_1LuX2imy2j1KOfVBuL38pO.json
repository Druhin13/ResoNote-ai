  "lyrics": "The smell of your body\r\nIs making me heave and gag\r\nI thought you were candy\r\nJust like your nature, my good man\r\nSo now you can't leave me\r\nJust like the rest of them did\n\nAs we sink into the East Bay Brooklyn dirge\n\nThank God I'm done with this\n\n\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\n\n\nSo go ask your Chomsky\n\nWhat these systems produce\n\nThe cracks in commandments\n\nThat we can slip through\n\nYou develop a callus\n\nWhen you're being lied to\n\nBut now my pain is all just gravy\n\nAs you drown beneath the waves with me and sing\n\n\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nNow we are the sediment\n\nSediment\n\n\n\nI wake up with a humming glow of a hundred Percocets\n\nI have the arms of a baby, veins of an old lady\n\nMy vision is runny and profound\n\nThere's a still light we sit behind\n\nYou turn to me and ask if I'd like you to stay\n\nBut I didn't have anything here\n\nI say \"I should have dissolved in you, but I made us statistics\n\nThey can write us off, but I don't fucking deserve you\"\n\nYou look confused, but after a very awkward pause\n\nYou kiss my cheek and then walk off\n\nLeft alone now, I start to age backwards\n\nAnd I'm viciously hungering for someone\n\nTo love me the way my parents never did\n\nThere must be someone who can somewhere\n\nMaybe I'll take a walk and see, after all it's so big\n\nIt goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on"
