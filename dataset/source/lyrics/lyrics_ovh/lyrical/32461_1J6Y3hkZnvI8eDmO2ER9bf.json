  "title": "We, The Drowned",
  "lyrics": "We, the drowned\r\nHold our hollow hearted ground\r\nTil we swallow ourselves down\r\nAgain\r\nWe, the ashes,\n\nWe spend our days like matches\n\nAnd burned ourselves as black as\n\nThe end.\n\nWe know not the fire in which we burn\n\nBut we sing and we sing\n\nAnd the flames grow higher.\n\nWe read not the pages which we turn\n\nBut we sing and we sing and we sing\n\n\n\nWe, the wrong,\n\nWe the swen up and long gone,\n\nWere before and all along\n\nLike this\n\n\n\nWe, the drowned\n\nThe lost and found out,\n\nWe are all finished again."
