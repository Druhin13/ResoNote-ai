  "lyrics": "Life is running a race while you're smoking, falling apart\r\nYou can fall, you can fail as long as it comes from your heart\r\nIf you’re down on your face, it's okay, you can look up\r\nYou are what you say, no, you are not where you're from\r\nYou are right where you should be\n\nYou are right here next to me\n\nWhat do you need when you have everything?\n\n’Cause you are right where you should be\n\nYou are right where you should be\n\nYou are right here next to me\n\nWhat do you need when you have everything?\n\n'Cause you are right where you should be\n\n\n\nRight where you should be\n\nRight where you should be\n\n\n\nYou feel like life's on your shoulders, crawling under your skin\n\nNail-biting thoughts lying bedside, but don't know where to begin\n\nFeeling lesser from pressure, always you can swim up\n\nYou are what you say, just know that you're good enough\n\n\n\nYou are right where you should be\n\nYou are right here next to me\n\nWhat do you need when you have everything?\n\n'Cause you are right where you should be\n\n\n\nRight where you should be\n\nRight where you should be\n\n\n\nYou are right where you should be\n\nYou are right here next to me\n\nWhat do you need when you have everything?\n\nYou are right where you should be\n\n\n\nYou are right where you should be\n\nYou are right here next to me\n\nWhat do you need when you have everything?\n\n'Cause you are right where you should be"
