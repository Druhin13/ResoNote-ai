  "lyrics": "You are lost soul cursed with a desperate need\r\nTrying to find something that your eyes can't see\r\n'Cause you're damn damn damaged just like me\r\nYou need love, you need love\r\n\nYour life is even more messed up than mine \n\nThat's the part that makes you so God damn divine \n\nWanna fix you up, wanna make you shine\n\nYou need love, you need love\n\n\n\nI wanna squeeze you until it bleeds \n\nI'll love you so hard you'll stay forever \n\nI wanna make you scream my name, until you come inside \n\nI wanna come, I wanna come \n\nI wanna come, come, comfort you\n\n\n\nWhen I'm with you my past canâ€™t fuck with me \n\nLike a bullet, put me out of my misery \n\nYou're my drug you're my fan fan fan fantasy \n\nI need love, I need love\n\n\n\nI'm wanna squeeze you until it bleeds \n\nI'll love you so hard you'll stay forever \n\nI wanna make you scream my name, until you come inside \n\nI wanna come, I wanna come \n\nI wanna come, come, comfort you\n\n\n\nI'm gonna squeeze you until it bleeds \n\nI wanna make you scream my name\n\nI'm wanna squeeze you until it bleeds \n\nI'll love you so hard you'll stay forever \n\nI wanna make you scream my name, until you come inside \n\nI wanna come, I wanna come \n\nI wanna come, come, comfort you\n\n\n\nI'm gonna come, I'm gonna come\n\nI'm gonna come, come, comfort you"
