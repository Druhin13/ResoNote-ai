  "lyrics": "There was a man he was often alone\r\nLost in his own thoughts caught in frivolous zone\r\nFeelin' there's no home to go where he'll fit, and he'll glow\r\nSo he stayed to himself as he said it in his stone\r\nHis heart, you couldn't clone\r\nGoin' toe to toe with a steel boot\n\nShowin' all the courage he could show\n\nBut there's only so much we control as we livin'\n\nSo the hand he was dealt led to erratic descions\n\nBut none of that mattered if it meant better livin'\n\nSo he went from trappin' to catchin' lil niggas slippin'\n\nHe was his own team, he was Jordan and Pippen\n\nHe never took an L, all he ever knew was winnin'\n\nHe knew that he was trippin' but couldn't get caught slippin'\n\nBut it all went wrong when he really seen it different\n\nHe started to chill, but he was too defendant\n\nHe started to learn life right when his ended\n\n\n\nGuess that's the game of life\n\nIn the blink of an eye, you could say good night\n\nNo time to prepare to fight\n\nEverything ain't fair in the game of life\n\nNo, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nThis game ain't fair, I seen plenty prepare and lose\n\nIt's the truth"
