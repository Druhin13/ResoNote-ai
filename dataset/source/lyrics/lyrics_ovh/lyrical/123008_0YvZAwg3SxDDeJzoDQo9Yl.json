  "lyrics": "(Wasted, wasted, wasted, wasted)\r\nThe phone rings, already know who's calling\r\nBut every time it's after two\r\nIt ain't you, but the champagne talking\r\nSaying \"Baby, when you coming through?\"\n\n\n\nYou like to call me when you're high\n\nEnd of the party, I'm your guy\n\nThing is I do this every night\n\nAnd I don't wanna come off impatient\n\nBut you only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\n\n\nWasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted (wasted, wasted, wasted)\n\n\n\nI wait for the day you tell me\n\nYou'll see me in the afternoon\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love our late night evenings\n\nBut that ain't all I want from you\n\n\n\nYou like to call me when you're high\n\nEnd of the party, I'm your guy\n\nThing is I do this every night\n\nAnd I don't wanna come off impatient\n\nBut you only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\n\n\nWasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're wasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted\n\n\n\nYou like to call me when you're high\n\nAnd baby, trust me, that's alright\n\n'Cause I will answer every time\n\nBut we should be taking this places\n\nAnd you only call when you're\n\nI don't wanna come off impatient\n\nBut you only call when you're\n\nAs much as I love when you're naked\n\n\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're wasted\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nYou only call when you're\n\nWasted (wasted, wasted, wasted)"
