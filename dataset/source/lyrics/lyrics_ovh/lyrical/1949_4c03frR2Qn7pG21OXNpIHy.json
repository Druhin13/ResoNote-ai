  "lyrics": "It got so hot, last night, I swear\r\nYou couldn't hardly breathe\r\nHeat lightning burnt the sky like alcohol\r\nI sat on the porch without my shoes\r\nAnd I watched the cars roll by\r\nAs the headlights raced\n\nTo the corner of the kitchen wall.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nMama dear \n\nYour boy is here\n\nFar across the sea\n\nWaiting for\n\nThat sacred core\n\nThat burns inside of me\n\nAnd I feel a storm\n\nAll wet and warm\n\nNot ten miles away\n\nApproaching\n\nMy Mexican home.\n\n\n\nMy God! I cried, it's so hot inside\n\nYou could die in the living room\n\nTake the fan from the window\n\nProp the door back with a broom\n\nThe cuckoo clock has died of shock\n\nAnd the windows feel no pane\n\nThe air's as still\n\nAs the throttle on a funeral train.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\n\n\nMy father died on the porch outside\n\nOn an August afternoon\n\nI sipped bourbon and cried\n\nWith a friend by the light of the moon\n\nSo its hurry! hurry! Step right up\n\nIt's a matter of life or death\n\nThe sun is going down\n\nAnd the moon is just holding its breath.\n\n\n\nChorus:"
