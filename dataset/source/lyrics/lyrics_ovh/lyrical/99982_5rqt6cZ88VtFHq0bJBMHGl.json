  "lyrics": "I remember losing tempers in the back of the taxi cab\r\nAnd making up in your sixth floor apartment you used to have\r\nSlim like a rack\r\nBetween subway stops with your head on my shoulder, baby\r\nAnd we took pictures of moments\r\nHung 'em, we thought that they'd never change\n\nThey'd never change\n\n\n\nTo that night in Brooklyn\n\nWe said things we shouldn't\n\nBet you must've been [?], way that it bowed down\n\nNow I don't go to Brooklyn\n\nIt's like it never happened\n\nWe were falling with our feet on the ground\n\nOoo, baby, we don't talk anymore\n\nOoo, baby, we don't talk anymore\n\nSince Brooklyn\n\n\n\nLight in the park until dark\n\nAnd we would tell each other secret things\n\nPut on that dress upon a booth\n\nAnd we count it all with sediments, hey\n\nYou are my coat locker, uniform\n\nCower up and you roll the sleeves\n\nWe crossed our hearts in the block\n\nAnd we swore to God that we'd never leave\n\nWe'd never leave\n\n\n\nTo that night in Brooklyn\n\nWe said things we shouldn't\n\nBet you must've been [?], way that it bowed down\n\nNow I don't go to Brooklyn\n\nIt's like it never happened\n\nWe were falling with our feet on the ground\n\nOoo, baby, we don't talk anymore\n\nOoo, baby, we don't talk anymore\n\nSince Brooklyn\n\n\n\n\n\nOoo, We don't talk, we don't talk, no\n\nBaby, we don't talk anymore - oh\n\nOoo, We don't talk, we don't talk, no\n\nBaby, we don't talk anymore - oh oh oh\n\nBaby, we don't talk anymore\n\nOoo, baby, we don't talk anymore... Since Brooklyn."
