  "lyrics": "(Take 5 million)\r\nWell she wore you like silk\r\nBadanged all around\r\nLike the scars of your love\r\nCame your hollow crown\n\n\n\nAnd she held you through the night\n\nAnd kissed you through the cold\n\nBlinded by your light\n\nWas waiting to grow old\n\n\n\nShe said, love, I give you everything\n\nI give you everything that you need\n\nOh, love, well I'd do anything\n\nAnd I'd do anything to be seen\n\n\n\nSo when you packed all of your bags\n\nAnd left without a word\n\nWell the voices in her head\n\nWere begging to be heard\n\n\n\nSo she wept all through the night\n\nAnd slept all through the day\n\n'cause her lonely, lonely heart\n\nWas calling [?]\n\n\n\nAnd she said\n\nLove, I gave you everything\n\nI gave you everything that you need\n\nOh, love, well I'd do anything\n\nAnd I'd do anything to be seen\n\n\n\nSo why did we break down\n\nAnd why did we break down\n\nWas it just 'cause we weren't ready\n\nSo why did we break down\n\nAnd why did we break down\n\nWas it just 'cause we weren't ready\n\n\n\nSo why did we break\n\nAnd why did we break down\n\nWas I (too) vulnerable or too unsteady\n\n\n\nWell love, I gAve you everything\n\nI gAve you everything that you need\n\nOh, love, wellI'd do anything\n\nAnd I'd do anything to be seen\n\n\n\nOh, love, well I'd do anything\n\nAnything to be free\n\nTo be free, to be free"
