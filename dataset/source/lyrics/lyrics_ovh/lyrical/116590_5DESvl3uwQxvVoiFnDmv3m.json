  "lyrics": "I wish I was a pirate ship wreck down in Mexico\r\nWhere the oceans turn to silver\r\nAnd the beaches turn to gold\r\nI'd make love to some se√±orita in that town\r\nThen I'd get on my boat and I'd sail the ocean round\n\n\n\nI wish I was a pirate out there under my own flag\n\nRunning for no reason and no reason to turn back\n\nSalt and rum on my tongue, sails tattered and torn\n\nLaughing in the devil's face, riding out a storm\n\n\n\nOoo, what are these days?\n\nGonna get off these highways\n\nWake up in some bay\n\nWith sunshine on my face\n\nSt. Christopher on a silver chain\n\nSay a prayer, sail away\n\n\n\n\n\nOoo, what are these days?\n\nGonna get off these highways\n\nWake up in some bay\n\nWith sunshine on my face\n\nSt. Christopher on a silver chain\n\nSay a prayer, sail away\n\n\n\nI wish I was a pirate on some ghost ship in the night\n\nWith nothing but the stars, the moon\n\nAnd faith to be my guide\n\nSteady as she goes, with my back to the wind\n\nThen in a cloud of cannon smoke I'd disappear again"
