  "lyrics": "It's a fine, fine line\r\nBetween whiskey, and water, and to wine\r\nIt's a long way home\r\nWhen you're down and out and out here on your own\r\nBut it don't matter who you are when it's time to lock and load\n\nEverybody's got a little outlaw in 'em\n\nGold piece hiding in their blacked out denim\n\nHeartbeat beating to a rock n' roll rhythm, yeah\n\nEverybody got a couple scarred up knuckles\n\nBlood on their boots and their back up buckle\n\nDiamond back rattle with the quick strike venom\n\nEverybody's got a little outlaw in 'em\n\n\n\nWhen they knock you to the ground\n\nYou ain't gonna let nobody keep you down\n\nWhen you're backed against the wall\n\nThat's when you gotta learn to stand up tall\n\nYeah, that rebel fights inside of you\n\nThat's been there all along\n\n\n\nEverybody's got a little outlaw in 'em\n\nGold piece hiding in their blacked out denim\n\nHeartbeat beating to a rock n' roll rhythm, yeah\n\nEverybody got a couple scarred up knuckles\n\nBlood on their boots and their back up buckle\n\nDiamond back rattle with the quick strike venom\n\nEverybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, oh, oh\n\n\n\nEverybody's got a little outlaw in 'em\n\nGold piece hiding in their blacked out denim\n\nHeartbeat beating to a rock n' roll rhythm, yeah\n\nHuh, everybody got little front man swagger\n\nStone cold rolling like a young Mick Jagger\n\nA new tattoo that you can't keep hidden\n\nEverybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, oh, ooh\n\n\n\n\n\nI said, everybody's got a little outlaw in 'em, aw"
