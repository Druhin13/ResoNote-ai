  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Fast Slow Disco par St Vincent\r\nI sway in place to a slow disco\nAnd a glass for the saints and a bow for the road\n\nAm I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?\nI'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave?\n\nSlip my hand from your hand\nLeave you dancin' with a ghost\nSlip my hand from your hand\nLeave you dancin' with a ghost\n\nThere's blood in my ears and a fool in the mirror\nAnd the bay of mistakes couldn't get any clearer\n\nAm I thinking what everybody's thinkin'?\nI'm so glad I came, but I can't wait to leave?\n\n\nSlip my hand from your hand\nLeave you dancin' with a ghost\nSlip my hand from your hand\nLeave you dancin' with a ghost\n\nDon't it beat a slow dance to death?\nDon't it beat a slow dance to death?\nDon't it beat a slow dance to death?\nDon't it beat a slow dance to death?\nDon't it beat a slow dance to death?\nDon't it beat a slow dance to death?"
