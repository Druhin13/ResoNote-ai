  "lyrics": "Well, you almost had me fooled\r\nTell me that I was nothing without you\r\nAnd after everything you've done\r\nI can thank you for how strong I have become\r\n'Cause you brought the flames and you put me through hell\n\nI had to learn how to fight for myself\n\nAnd we both know all the truth I could tell\n\nI'll just say this is I wish you farewell\n\n\n\nI hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'\n\nI hope your soul is changin', changin'\n\nI hope you find your peace\n\nFalling on your knees, prayin'\n\n\n\nI'm proud of who I am\n\nNo more monsters, I can breathe again\n\nAnd you said that I was done\n\nYou were wrong and now the best is yet to come\n\nI can make it on my own\n\nI don't need you, I found a strength I've never known\n\nI'll bring thunder, and I'll bring rain\n\nWhen I'm finished, they won't even know your name\n\n\n\nYou brought the flames and you put me through hell\n\nI had to learn how to fight for myself\n\nAnd we both know all the truth I could tell\n\nI'll just say this is I wish you farewell\n\n\n\nI hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'\n\nI hope your soul is changin', changin'\n\nI hope you find your peace\n\nFalling on your knees, prayin'\n\n\n\nOh, sometimes I pray for you at night\n\nSomeday (someday), maybe you'll see the light (see the light)\n\nOh, some say, in life, you're gonna get what you give (get what you give)\n\nBut some things only God can forgive\n\n\n\nI hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'\n\nI hope your soul is changin', changin'\n\nI hope you find your peace\n\nFalling on your knees, prayin'"
