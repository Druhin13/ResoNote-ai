  "lyrics": "Hey let's party, let's get down, let's turn the radio on,\r\nThis is the meltdown.\r\nGet out the camera, take a picture,\r\nThe drag queens and the freaks\r\nAre all out on the town.\r\nAnd cowboy Jane's in bed\n\nNursing a swollen head.\n\nSunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov\n\nDon't like the scene anyhow.\n\nI dropped acid on a Saturday night\n\nJust to see what the fuss was about.\n\nNow there goes the neighborhood.\n\nThe photo chick made to look sickly\n\nIs standing in her panties in the shower.\n\nShe plays the guitar in the bathroom\n\nWhile the police dust her mother's plastic flowers.\n\nAnd Schooboy John's in jail\n\nMaking a killing through the U.S. mail.\n\nSunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov\n\nDon't like the scene anyhow.\n\nI dropped acid on a Saturday night\n\nJust to see what the fuss was about.\n\nThere goes the neighborhood.\n\nThere goes the neighborhood.\n\nThis is the movie of the screenplay of the book about a girl who meets a junkie.\n\nThe messenger gets shot down just for carrying the message to a flunkie.\n\nWe can't be certain who the villans are 'cuz everyone's so pretty\n\nBut the afterparty's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your city.\n\nSunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov\n\nDon't like the scene anyhow.\n\nI dropped acid on a Saturday night\n\nJust to see what the stink was about.\n\nSunshine Sally and Peter Ustanov\n\nDon't like the scene anyhow.\n\nI dropped acid on a Saturday night\n\nJust to see what the fuss was about.\n\nThere goes the neighborhood.\n\nThere goes the neighborhood"
