  "lyrics": "All the shades of gray that loom inside me\r\nNo one's ever home and there's no one around me\r\nSuch a perfect waste this soul behind me\r\nNo one really knows what truly drive me\r\nI know what I've done wrong\n\nI knew it all along\n\nI can't let it go, let it go, let it go\n\n\n\nRun away, run away\n\nLook away, look away\n\nMy seed inside you\n\nI'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways\n\nRun away, run away\n\nGet away, get away\n\nLeave me behind you\n\nI'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways\n\n\n\nAll the things we read that have designed me\n\nAll the hell I've seen, it still confines me\n\nAll the pain I've held, it's still inside me\n\nAll the rage I have, it still completes me\n\n\n\nI know what I've done wrong\n\nI knew it all along\n\nI can't let it go, let it go, let it go\n\nLet it go\n\n\n\nRun away, run away\n\nLook away, look away\n\nMy seed inside you\n\nI'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways\n\nRun away, run away\n\nGet away, get away\n\nLeave me behind you\n\nI'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways\n\n\n\nRun away, run away\n\nLook away, look away\n\nMy seed inside you\n\nI'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways\n\nRun away, run away\n\nGet away, get away\n\nLeave me behind you\n\nI'm stuck in my ways, stuck in my ways\n\nStuck in my ways, stuck in my ways"
