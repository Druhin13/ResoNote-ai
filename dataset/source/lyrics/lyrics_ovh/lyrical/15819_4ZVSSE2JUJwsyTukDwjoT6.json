Are you? Are you?\n\n\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me, baby\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\n\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\n\n\nFading in the dark\n\nAll the lights\n\nGo down\n\nI'm feeling high and drunk\n\nClose my eyes\n\nAnd I can't stop\n\nThinking of you\n\nWalking on a lonely avenue\n\nAre you? Are you? Are you?\n\n\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me, baby\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\n\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me, baby\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign\n\nMy love is so wild\n\nPlease give me a sign"
