  "lyrics": "Summer comes and when it fades you're in that little dress again, yeah\r\nIt's like a knife that cuts deep\r\nAnd I can't bear to think about just how close we used to be\r\nIt keeps me up, I can't sleep\r\nAll my friends were lost but I was found\n\nThen I threw it away when we walked on hollow ground\n\n\n\nBut I will run back into your arms\n\nNo matter where we are, if you need me too\n\nIf you still got some space in your heart\n\nI would tear this world apart for you\n\n\n\nWe needed space and a little time, girl I hope you change your mind\n\nAnd come back to me\n\nRemember all the mornings you would make me late\n\nI couldn't bare to leave you when you looked at me the way you do\n\n\n\nAll my friends were lost but I was found, yeah\n\nThen I threw it away when we walked on hollow ground, yeah\n\n\n\nBut I will run back into your arms\n\nNo matter where we are, if you need me too\n\nIf you still got some space in your heart\n\nI would tear this world apart for you\n\nYou're the star that makes my heart burn brighter\n\nI would walk through the fire for you, for you\n\n\n\nAnd if I'm there too late, mmh, yes\n\nA couple things I got to say\n\n\n\nBut I will run back into your arms\n\nNo matter where we are, if you need me too\n\nIf you still got some space in your heart\n\nI would tear this world apart for you\n\nYou're the star that makes my heart burn brighter\n\nI would walk through the fire for you, for you\n\nYou're the star that makes my heart burn brighter\n\nI would walk through the fire for you, for you"
