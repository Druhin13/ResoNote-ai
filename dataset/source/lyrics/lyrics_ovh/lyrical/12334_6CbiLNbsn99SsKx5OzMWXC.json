  "lyrics": "Nobody showed you how to live?\r\nMe either\r\nGet a steady job, couple kids\r\nAct decent\r\nBut I've been on a ten-speed thinking about the time as the sun sets\r\nLike, what would I do different if I hit rewind and did it again?\n\n\n\nI tried to figure it out but nothing was coming to mind\n\nRemembered all my mistakes\n\nBut the memories made me smile\n\nI told the one that I loved that love would mean letting me go\n\nEven though I was afraid\n\nYou gotta do some things on your own\n\nThis one goes out to all the dreamers at sea\n\nThis life is only what you want it to be\n\nAnd I want more, I want more\n\n\n\nYou go to heaven when you die\n\nI'm betting\n\nYou're still with me on the line?\n\nJust checking\n\nCause I've been making fast friends, late at night the kind when the sun sets\n\nLike, waking up and thinking honey why I do it again?\n\n\n\nI came to in a cold sweat with a nosebleed feeling hopeless\n\nThought I maybe might be dead til I got my pen sat down and wrote this\n\nSuddenly I felt fine inside a mind so full of ghosts\n\nThe darkest nights mean you see the stars the most\n\n\n\nThis one goes out to all the dreamers at sea\n\nThis life is only what you want it to be\n\nAnd I want more, I want more\n\n\n\nI used to knock on wood\n\nI used to never curse\n\nI used to think I could\n\nControl the universe\n\nWith my obsessive thoughts\n\nAnd what felt like a prayer\n\nI shouted to the sky don't let my family disappear\n\nI used to feel alone\n\nI used to not belong\n\nBut little did I know I had the power all along\n\nThe only thing to fear\n\nIs never being scared"
