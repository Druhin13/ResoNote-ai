  "lyrics": "Girl, I still remember\r\nWe were 17 and full of dreams we knew would all come true\r\nOur first taste of forever\r\nLike a good old song, when you turn it on it always feels brand new\r\nAnd you said \"Have we fallen too fast, is it too good to last?\"\n\nThen I promised you\n\n\n\nI will be the one to save you\n\nWhen you got nowhere to run\n\nAnd whenever this world breaks you\n\nI'll be there to pick you up\n\nIf you're feeling desperation\n\nAnd your faith is all but gone\n\nI will give you my last breath so you can carry on\n\nI love you that much, and then some\n\n\n\nHere we are together\n\nOn an autumn day at your mama's place\n\nBack in your hometown\n\nThis love can last forever\n\nI can only say what I'm gonna say with one knee on the ground\n\n\n\n\"Make me a better man, take a hold of my hand\n\nHoney I promise you\"\n\n\n\nI will be the one to save you\n\nWhen you got nowhere to run\n\nAnd whenever this world breaks you\n\nI'll be there to pick you up\n\nIf you're feeling desperation\n\nAnd your faith is all but gone\n\nI will give you my last breath so you can carry on\n\nI love you that much, and then some\n\n\n\nIt just gets better and better with every day\n\nOne thing's for certain, I'll always say\n\n\n\nI will be the one to save you\n\nWhen you got nowhere to run\n\nAnd whenever this world breaks you\n\nI'll be there to pick you up\n\nWhen you're feeling desperation\n\nAnd your faith is all but gone\n\nI will give you my last breath so you can carry on\n\nI love you that much, and then some\n\nOh and then some\n\nIt just gets better and better with every day..."
