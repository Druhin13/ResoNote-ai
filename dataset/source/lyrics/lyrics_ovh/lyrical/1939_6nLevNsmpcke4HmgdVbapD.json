  "lyrics": "It's Wedding Day in Funeralville\r\nYour soup spoon's on your right\r\nThe King and Queen will alternate\r\nWith the refrigerator light\r\nThey'll be boxing on the T.V. show\r\nThe colored kids will sing\n\nHooray for you\n\nAnd midnight's oil\n\nLets burn the whole damn thing\n\n\n\nFelicia is my dark horse girl\n\nI'll take her if it rains\n\nShe throws up punch\n\nUpon the host\n\nAnd says many stupid things\n\nBut she ain't so bad\n\nWhen we're all alone\n\nShe's as different\n\nAs can be\n\nShe's a part a my heart\n\nDon'tcha pull us apart\n\nShe's like one of the family\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nOh no! Trouble in the attic\n\nWon't somebody turn on a light\n\nGot so, so many troubles\n\nCan't even tell\n\nWrong from right\n\nI'm gonna comb my hair\n\nDarn my socks\n\nTip my hat\n\nAnd say goodnight\n\nIt's Wedding Day in Funeralville\n\nWhat shall I wear tonight?\n\nIt's wedding Day in Funeralville\n\nWhat shall I wear tonight?\n\n\n\nMy car is stuck in Washington\n\nAnd I cannot find out why\n\nCome sit beside me on the swing\n\nAnd watch the angels cry\n\nIt's anybody's ballgame\n\nIt's everybody's fight\n\nAnd the streetlamp said\n\nAs he nodded his head\n\nIt's lonesome out tonight\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus"
