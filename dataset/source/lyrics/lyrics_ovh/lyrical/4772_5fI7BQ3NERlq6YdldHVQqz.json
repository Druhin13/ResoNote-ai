  "lyrics": "What do I say?\r\nThey told me that I'm too much to handle\r\nI've gotten way too fucking carried away\r\nAnd damn it's a shame these fuckers had the best and they blew it\r\nI'm running circles around the pussies they made\r\nI don't even care if I'm late\n\nAnd I will never make the mistake\n\nOf letting some crooked motherfucker steal the life from every one of my veins\n\nHow many times do I have to fight\n\nTo prove something that's already standing here in plain sight?\n\n\n\nMaybe if you ever looked\n\nYou'd see more than everything they want you to see\n\nAnd maybe if it's not enough\n\nSomeone else will take the crown if ever I leave\n\n\n\nThey never question when I say a thing\n\nThey know it's coming so they move aside and take their place\n\nIt's always different when it's face to face\n\nDon't fucking question what you've never seen or had to chase\n\nLook alive, look alive, you're barren\n\nThere's not a fight, no insight worth giving\n\nWhat makes you feel, and do you feel this at all?\n\n\n\nWith no words to say, dismembered every frame\n\nLocked out and now the close-minded make their claims\n\nDo you see me now?\n\nAre my conclusions profound?\n\n\n\nStart new every day, until you make it perfect in every way\n\n\n\nWhat's left in me, guess we'll see\n\nDidn't see this coming\n\nWhat's left in me, left in me\n\nWhat's left in me, guess we'll see\n\nDidn't see this coming\n\nWhat's left in me, left in me\n\nWhat's left in me, guess we'll see\n\nDidn't see this coming\n\nWhat's left in me, left in me"
