  "lyrics": "We could go to a drive-thru movie\r\nI put the top in the back or kiss 'til closing\r\nOr we could do what the stars are doing\r\nLay in the grass for hours and talk music\r\nI wish I could freeze this moment right here next to you\r\nIf you're asking me then I say we don't make our move\n\nI think tonight I wanna slow it down and do what you like\n\nYou know I don't mind, no rushing baby\n\nYou can stay the whole night\n\n\n\nWe can take forever right now\n\nI'll make it last forever right now\n\nWe can take forever right now\n\nI'll make it last forever right now\n\n\n\nSo let me love you 'til the sun up\n\nCheck it out, not too close\n\nBecause I kiss to tell ya'\n\nMake me want more time and more ya'\n\nBreak it down gotta test the water\n\nOh, I wish I could freeze this moment right here next to you\n\nIf you're asking me then I say we don't make our move\n\nI think tonight I wanna slow it down and do what you like\n\nYou know I don't mind, no rushing baby\n\nYou can stay the whole night\n\n\n\nWe can take forever right now\n\nI'll make it last forever right now\n\nWe can take forever right now\n\nI'll make it last forever right now\n\n\n\nWe can take forever right now\n\nI'll make it last forever right now\n\nWe can take forever right now\n\nI'll make it last forever right now"
