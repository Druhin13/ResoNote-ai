  "lyrics": "Are you going\r\nAre you going\r\nMy fading light\r\nWhere you going\r\nWhere you going\r\nIt's cold at night\n\nWithout your light\n\nThe sound of the night rings blue\n\n\n\nOh when,\n\nThey'll sit inside, they'll sit inside\n\nUntil you appear\n\nOh, and flowers hide,\n\nand she'll hide until you are near\n\nYou make things clear\n\nthrough the seam of the curtain blind\n\n\n\nIn the summer sun\n\nMy, my, unsettle\n\nIn the summer sun\n\nRoses and their petals\n\nseem to grow\n\n\n\nThe cities go\n\nbut so cold\n\nAre you there\n\nBut later, soon around\n\nAll around, the warm, warm air\n\nI feel you there\n\nBeating glares on my face\n\n\n\nThey'll sit inside, they'll sit inside\n\nUntil you appear\n\nOh, and flowers hide,\n\nand she'll hide until you are near\n\nYou make things clear\n\nthrough the seam of the curtain blind\n\n\n\nIn the summer sun\n\nMy, my, unsettle\n\nIn the summer sun\n\nRoses and their petals\n\nseem to grow\n\nRoses and their petals\n\nseem to grow\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to pinknpurple for these lyrics)"
