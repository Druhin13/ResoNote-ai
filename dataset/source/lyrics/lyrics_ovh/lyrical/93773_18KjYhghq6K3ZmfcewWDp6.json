  "lyrics": "Oh, we've been at it for so so long\r\nAnd you, keep telling me that Iâ€™m wrong\r\nAnd your eyes only see what they want to see\r\nBut now you're blinded when I leave\r\nAnd all I see is now\n\nI am, Mistaken\n\nThis time, I am sure\n\n\n\nLove, oh, mistaken\n\nI am sure\n\nI am sure\n\nI am sure\n\n\n\nOh, I've been waiting for the day\n\nThe things, will never ever be the same\n\nNot down, cause we are at the end of it\n\nThey lie, and again we are asleep\n\n\n\nAnd all I see is now\n\nI am, mistaken\n\nThis time, I am sure\n\n\n\nLove, oh, stranded\n\nI am sure\n\nI am sure\n\nI am sure"
