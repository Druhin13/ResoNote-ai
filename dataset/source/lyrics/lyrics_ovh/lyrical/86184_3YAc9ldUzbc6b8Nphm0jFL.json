  "lyrics": "(David Foster, Tom Keane and Cynthia Weil)\r\nI look in your eyes and I can see\r\nWe've loved so dangerously\r\nYou're not trusting your heart to anyone\r\nYou tell me you're gonna play it smart\n\nWe're through before we start\n\nBut I believe that we've only just begun\n\n\n\nWhen it's this good, there's no saying no\n\nI want you so, I'm ready to go\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nThrough the fire\n\nTo the limit, to the wall\n\nFor a chance to be with you\n\nI'd gladly risk it all\n\nThrough the fire\n\nThrough whatever, come what may\n\nFor a chance at loving you\n\nI'd take it all the way\n\nRight down to the wire\n\nEven through the fire\n\n\n\nI know you're afraid of what you feel\n\nYou still need time to heal\n\nAnd I can help if you'll only let me try\n\nYou touch me and something in me knew\n\nWhat I could have with you\n\nWell I'm not ready to kiss that dream goodbye\n\n\n\nWhen it's this sweet, there's no saying no\n\nI need you so, I'm ready to go\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nThrough the test of time\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nThrough the fire, to the limit\n\nThrough the fire, through whatever\n\nThrough the fire, to the limit\n\nThrough the fire, through whatever"
