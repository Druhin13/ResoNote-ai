  "lyrics": "Springtime, the acacias are blooming,\r\nSouthern California will see one more day.\r\nDreamland and business is booming, \nBirds are asingin' as I drift away. \nShe looks another year older, \n\nFrom too many lovers who used her and ran. \n\nBut some nights, oh she looks like an angel, \n\nShe's always willing to hold you again. \n\n\n\nCHORUS: \n\nSo give her this dance, \n\nShe can't be forsaken. \n\nLearn how to love her \n\nWith all of her faults. \n\nShe gave more than she's taken \n\nAnd I'll go down doing the Hollywood Waltz. \n\n\n\nSpringtime, and the lady is grieving, \n\nHer lovers just stand there with nothing to say. \n\nThey got what they wanted. \n\nThey 're packing and leaving, \n\nTo look for another to love the same way. \n\n\n\n(CHORUS)\n\n\n\nThe Hollywood Waltz, the Hollywood Waltz."
