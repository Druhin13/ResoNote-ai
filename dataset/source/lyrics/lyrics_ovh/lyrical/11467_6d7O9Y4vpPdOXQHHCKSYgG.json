  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson American Dreamz par Tom MacDonald\r\nWe're making murderers' famous, they kill a bunch of kids and get on all the front pages (on all the front pages)\nI don't know none of the victims, I know the guns in the system, from that the ones who are dangerous (ones who are dangerous)\nIt's become entertainment, we got T-shirts and posters covered in murderers' faces\nWe got movies gettin' made portraying killers as saviors and parents leaving kids alone at home with guns in the basement\n\nWould you pull me from a burning car or run to get your phone so you can film it yelling World Star (World Star)\nA gun don't make a soldier with a purple heart, a gun can not protect us if we don't know where are morals are\n\nStudents fill the classes and the graves and you claim it's a conspiracy to take your guns away\nAll the while the families torn apart and trying to ask why their sun deserved to die at his desk in his class\n\nWe don't want a politician making money off a bullet holes\nThey're digging our graves, the home of the brave has gone up in flames\nGive a fuck about the system, we're not doing what we're told\nThe land of the free is armed to the teeth, American Dreamz\n\nWe're distracted by free porn and compilation videos of puppies and kittens (puppies and kittens)\nWhile our children use the internet to bully one anther and then purchase ammunition (ammunition)\n\nSo addicted to your phone that you ignore the kids and never give them any supervision so they learn to build a bomb with things you keep inside your kitchen and you wonder how they ended up with life inside of prison (prison)\nWe mourned a dead gorilla but don't care when it's a person we're forgetting that we're human (that we're human)\nWe're angry that chickens are being locked up in cages and then forget we do the same to kids in our institutions\nWhen they ask you about stupid shit you tell them they should Google it then you wonder why the troubled youth are homicidal lunatics\nYou think it's tragic when a shooter kill a student but then say it's all a plan for them to change the constitution\n\n\nWe don't want a politician making money off a bullet holes\nThey're digging our graves, the home of the brave has gone up in flames\nGive a fuck about the system, we're not doing what we're told\nThe land of the free is armed to the teeth, American Dreamz\n\nYesterday will be the same shit as tomorrow if we don't wake up today\n\nWe don't want a politician making money off a bullet holes\nThey're digging our graves, the home of the brave has gone up in flames\nGive a fuck about the system, we're not doing what we're told\n\nThe land of the free is armed to the teeth, American Dreamz"
