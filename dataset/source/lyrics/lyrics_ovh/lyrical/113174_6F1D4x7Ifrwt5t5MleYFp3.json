Why you saying that you wouldn’t cry for me?\n\nWell I’ve got enough tears for two\n\n\n\nThere's always a reason in disguise\n\nWish it was all just some kind of lie\n\nThere's always a reason in disguise\n\nOh I never know why we go through it all\n\n\n\nNever\n\nNever know why we go through it all\n\nLet me tell now\n\n\n\nThere's always a reason in disguise\n\nWish it was all just some kind of lie\n\nThere's always a reason in disguise\n\nOh I never know why we go through it all\n\nNo I never know"
