  "lyrics": "Some things last, sometimes you never get over\r\nLive in the past, you find out it's hard to stay sober\r\nMy see-through skin like Eurythane\r\nLost and then found, on view for all and I wouldn't trade\r\nYou'd never know a long time ago you were frowning\n\nThinkin' it over\n\nIt's raining down, and somehow you know\n\n\n\nIt reminds me why I even care anymore\n\nYou can find me writhing in the ghost of a song\n\nRising through the Rainier fog\n\n\n\nSome people change, sometimes you leave how it oughta be\n\nFind a new way to come clean, let it wash over me\n\nMy see-through heart like Eurythane\n\nBeats for you proud, up down and through all the love and pain\n\n\n\nYou'd never know a long time ago you were crowning\n\nThinkin' it over\n\nIt's raining down, and somehow you know\n\n\n\nIt reminds me why I even care anymore\n\nYou can find me writhing in the ghost of a song\n\nRising through the Rainier fog\n\n\n\nLeft me here so all alone, only for me to find\n\nHear your voice on waves we rode, echoes inside my mind\n\nDisembodied just a trace of what it was like then\n\nWith you here we shared a space that's always half empty\n\nGrinding, grinding on\n\nAlways half empty\n\nGrinding, grinding on\n\nAlways half empty\n\n\n\nSo we can laugh it's inside, never hear me complain\n\nMy see-through city of cellophane\n\nYou'd never know a long time ago you were drowning\n\nThinking it over\n\nIt's raining down, and somehow you know\n\n\n\nIt reminds me why I even care anymore\n\nYou can find me writhing in the ghost of a song\n\nRising through the Rainier fog\n\n\n\nReminds me why I even care anymore\n\nYou can find me writhing in the ghost of a song\n\nRising through the Rainier fog"
