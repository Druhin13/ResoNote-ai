  "lyrics": "The heat is on, on the street\r\nInside your head, on every beat\r\nAnd the beat's so loud, deep inside\r\nThe presure's high, just to stay alive\r\nCause the heat is on\r\nOh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho\n\nCaught up in the action I've been looking out for you\n\nOh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\nThe heat is on, the heat is on, the heat is on\n\nthe heat is on Oh it's on the street , the heat is - on\n\n\n\nOh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho\n\nCaught up in the action I've been looking out for you\n\nOh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\nThe heat is on, the heat is on, the heat is on\n\nOh it's on the street , the heat is - on\n\n\n\nThe shadows are on the darker side\n\nBehind those doors, it's a wilder ride\n\nYou can make a break, you can win or lose\n\nThat's a chance you take, when the heat's on you\n\nWhen the heat is on\n\n\n\nOh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho\n\nCaught up in the action I've been looking out for you\n\nOh-wo-ho, oh-wo-ho\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\n(Tell me can you feel it)\n\nThe heat is on, the heat is on, the heat is on\n\n\n\nIt's on the street\n\nThe heat is on, the heat is on, the heat is on\n\nYeah it's on the street\n\nThe heat is on"
