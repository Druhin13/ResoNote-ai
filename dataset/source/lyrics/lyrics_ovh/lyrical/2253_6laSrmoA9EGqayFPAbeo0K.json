  "lyrics": "Takes so much to be a marvel\r\nIn this day and age\r\nEvery road has been followed\r\nEvery mistake's been made\r\nBut there's a lot to be desired\n\nAnd I find myself in memories\n\nStill alive just behind my eyes\n\nSeems the more I go leaving home looking for\n\nWhat I need's been buried in my soul\n\n\n\n'Cause I never heard a song sung quite like Elvis\n\nNothing beats the sound of the pouring rain\n\nAnd there's something in your kiss\n\nLeaves me so helpless\n\nYou leave me breathless\n\nYou leave me breathless\n\n\n\nSo there's this voice inside\n\nTerrified, plagued with pride\n\nResinating sound and like my own\n\nThen piece by piece so suddenly, no subtleties\n\nYour beauty, it can bring me to my knees\n\n\n\n'Cause I never heard a song sung quite like Elvis\n\nNot much beats the sound of the pouring rain\n\nAnd there's something in your kiss\n\nLeaves me so helpless\n\nYou leave me breathless\n\nYou leave me breathless\n\n\n\nI'm always wishing on the times we had\n\nWishin' I could get you back\n\nI'm always wishing on the times we had\n\nWishin' I could get you back\n\n\n\n'Cause I never heard a song sung quite like Elvis\n\nNot much beats the sound of the pouring rain\n\n\n\nAnd there's something in your kiss\n\nLeaves me so helpless\n\nAnd I can't help but see you again\n\nI can never see the sunrise too many times\n\nFall asleep with you under the northern lights\n\nAnd there's something in your touch\n\nLeaves me so helpless\n\nYou leave me breathless\n\nYou leave me breathless"
