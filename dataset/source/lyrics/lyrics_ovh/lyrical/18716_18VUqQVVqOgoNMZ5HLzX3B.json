  "lyrics": "My friends from high school\r\nMarried their high school boyfriends\r\nMoved into houses in the same ZIP codes\r\nWhere their parents live\r\nBut I, I could never follow\n\nNo I, I could never follow\n\n\n\nI hit the highway in a pink RV with stars on the ceiling\n\nLived like a gypsy\n\nSix strong hands on the steering wheel\n\n\n\nI've been a long time gone now\n\nMaybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down\n\nBut I've always found my way somehow\n\n\n\nBy taking the long way\n\nTaking the long way around\n\nTaking the long way\n\nTaking the long way around\n\n\n\nI met the queen of whatever\n\nDrank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies\n\nMoved with the shakers\n\nWouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to\n\n\n\nNo I, I could never follow\n\nNo I, I could never follow\n\n\n\nIt's been two long years now\n\nSince the top of the world came crashing down\n\nAnd I'm getting' it back on the road now\n\n\n\nBut I'm taking the long way\n\nTaking the long way around\n\nI'm taking the long way\n\nTaking the long way around\n\nThe long\n\nThe long way around\n\n\n\nWell, I fought with a stranger and I met myself\n\nI opened my mouth and I heard myself\n\nIt can get pretty lonely when you show yourself\n\nGuess I could have made it easier on myself\n\n\n\nBut I, I could never follow\n\nNo I, I could never follow\n\n\n\nWell, I never seem to do it like anybody else\n\nMaybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down\n\nIf you ever want to find me I can still be found\n\n\n\nTaking the long way\n\nTaking the long way around\n\nTaking the long way\n\nTaking the long way around"
