  "lyrics": "We move surface to air\r\nWill you follow me anywhere?\r\nTry to rise up, you lied up\r\nInto the silence\r\nIf you know what I know\r\nMaybe then someday you will go\n\nSeize the night far below\n\n\n\nTake my hand, shift in sand\n\nWhile the other on solid ground\n\nSide by side, rising tides\n\nStay up together\n\nHit the ground, feel revived\n\nNo, I had rather be right now\n\nJust in surface to air\n\n\n\nOpen up every door\n\nWas it the future that you saw?\n\nNow it's more than, it's less than a truth we're telling\n\nStep to the fire and then walk away and leave it\n\nThe clock is keeping time\n\nNow you better hear it\n\nStep to the fire and then I can almost feel it\n\nDon't spend a half-lifetime\n\nThinking while make-believing\n\n\n\nWe've been weightless too long\n\nOver everything we have done\n\nNever hide out, let's ride out\n\nAbove horizons\n\nLight out, let it burn\n\nShow me a way I can return\n\nJust a surface to air\n\n\n\nOpen up every door\n\nWas it the future that you saw?\n\nNow it's more than, it's less than a truth we're telling\n\nStep to the fire and then walk away and leave it\n\nThe clock is keeping time\n\nNow you better hear it\n\nStep to the fire and then I can almost feel it\n\nDon't spend a half-lifetime\n\nThinking while make-believing\n\n\n\nStep to the fire and then walk away and leave it\n\nThe clock is keeping time\n\nNow you better hear it\n\nStep to the fire and then I can almost feel it\n\nDon't spend a half-lifetime\n\nThinking while make-believing\n\n\n\nStep to the fire and then walk away and leave it\n\nThe clock is keeping time\n\nNow you better hear it\n\nStep to the fire and then I can almost feel it\n\nDon't spend a half-lifetime\n\nThinking while make-believing"
