Got muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? You got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? You got muscle?\n\n\n\nYeah, how many niggas from the block?\n\nWho’s a real nigga ’til they get popped?\n\nGet knocked, ’til that nigga turn to God, they’re a cop\n\nAnd I never gave a fuck about an opp, yeah-hah\n\nJuice thicker than a raindrop\n\nI done seen more coons than Boondocks, uh\n\nHear the songs, then he go, then he stop, uh\n\nBeat his ass, take his chain, then we out, out\n\nI don’t give a fuck about the car, um\n\nI just really care about the outcome\n\nMan, a nigga really miss Malcolm\n\nGunshots for the club, clout dumb\n\nThis real nigga shit ransom\n\nNot random, throw tantrums\n\nMy bitch be bad, you can’t fathom\n\nSo I cop the Phantom, uh\n\nBet you can’t hold the heat and cop what’s on the flame\n\nI can’t find you? I’ll beat your mans\n\nI be in the food to fuck with features\n\nSo fatigue and ‘lead the fifth and lead the fam\n\nI be in the streets for weeks\n\nAnd hold my dirty Glocks for three\n\nAnd shoot out with your clan\n\nI just want the bucks, the fiends, the cluck\n\nI got the stuff, you want to go inside the pan? Uh\n\n\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? You got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? You got muscle?\n\n\n\nI got a brand new shawty, big booty, she from Texas\n\nThe way she playing with the titties, make me feel like she ambidextrous\n\nOur crew damn near tied up, ain’t no time for extras\n\nThe way I whip the tires, I could start a fire in a Lexus\n\nI got one hand on the booty, the other is clutching my necklace\n\nAll these rappers, all these niggas better understand that I’m reckless\n\nAnd I heard you niggas reaping shawties and you think you relentless\n\nYeah, I’m on your ass, lil’ niggas, it ain’t no time for extras\n\n\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? You got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? (Flexin’)\n\nGot muscle? Got muscle? Got muscle? You got muscle?\n\n\n\nYou got muscle? Flex\n\nSteppin’ on a lil’ bitch neck\n\nWater drippin’ off my Rolex\n\nTrap back door, Bowflex\n\nRunnin’ up a big blue check\n\nHundred blue baguettes\n\nGoldLink wrist on my neck\n\nPercocet mixin’ with the molly, get her wet\n\nSmoking on exotic, good Biscotti on the jet\n\nPot Illuminati, catch a body with the TEC\n\nGot muscle? Fuck it, young nigga, just flex\n\n448, I invest in the best\n\nThousand eight grams, you can hit it, take a test\n\nWockhardt, Hi-Tech, smell it when I piss\n\nYou ain’t Crip, we ain’t all stressin’, motion with a bitch\n\nDior, Chanel, my ‘Gatti, Aventi’\n\nDouble R truck, I might hop out in Fendi\n\nLongway, bitch\n\n\n\nYou got muscle? Huh\n\nArm & Hammer music, let’s get it"
