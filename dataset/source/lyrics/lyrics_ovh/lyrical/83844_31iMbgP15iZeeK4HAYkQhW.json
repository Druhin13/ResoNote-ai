  "lyrics": "How, with everything you’ve done\r\nWill coming home change what we’ve both become?\r\nI lost my best years in the wait\r\nAlways falling for your next excuse\r\nAnd still I’m sitting here my love\r\nPrepared enough to see this whole thing through\n\nBut I’ve lost my energy to fight\n\nI stay here only for the view\n\n\n\nIn all our years apart\n\nI’ve never let you know\n\nI’m done with treading here\n\nI need the undertow\n\n\n\nIn all our years apart\n\nI’ve never let you know\n\nI’m done with treading here\n\nI need the undertow\n\n\n\nHow did you think I’d be consoled\n\nBy telling me I’d always had control?\n\nI don’t need sympathy from you\n\nI need to know you’ll see this damned thing through\n\nBut I’ve lost my energy to fight\n\nI stay here only for the view\n\n\n\nIn all our years apart\n\nI’ve never let you know\n\nI’m done with treading here\n\nI need the undertow\n\n\n\nIn all our years apart\n\nI’ve never let you know\n\nI’m done with treading here\n\nI need the undertow\n\n\n\nIn your unrelenting pursuit of self\n\nYou left nothing for me to live on\n\nAnd I could not eat the detritus of gifts that you were given\n\nOh you whispered soft into my ear\n\nThat hunger is for the living\n\nAnd I’m still fucking starving man\n\nAnd I’ve just turned unforgiving\n\n\n\nIn all these years apart\n\nI’ve never let you know\n\nI’m done with treading here\n\nI need the undertow\n\n\n\nIn all our years apart\n\nI’ve never let you know\n\nI’m done with treading here\n\nI need the undertow"
