  "lyrics": "Pull the moon down with a lasso\r\nMake your ceiling full of stars glow\r\nI can sneak in through the window\r\nI could say it but we both know\r\nYou got me floating on cloud nine\n\nLook up when the world gets you down\n\nAnd you're gonna get by\n\nHang in when the world counts you out\n\nAnd you're gonna be fine\n\nSometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right\n\nBut when your hand is in mine\n\nYou got me floating on cloud nine\n\n\n\nMeet the one who makes your heart stop\n\nFind a diamond in a gift shop\n\nLive a little, love a whole lot\n\nAnd you'll be shouting from the rooftop\n\nYou got me floating on cloud nine\n\n\n\nLook up when the world gets you down\n\nAnd you're gonna get by\n\nHang in when the world counts you out\n\nAnd you're gonna be fine\n\nSometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right\n\nBut when your hand is in mine\n\nYou got me floating on cloud nine\n\n\n\nHey baby are we almost there yet ?\n\nAnd how much cooler could my life get ?\n\nTake my hand and take a deep breath\n\nAnd we'll ride off until the sunset\n\n\n\nLook up when the world gets you down\n\nAnd you're gonna get by\n\nHang in when the world counts you out\n\nAnd you're gonna be fine\n\nSometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right\n\nBut when your hand is in mine...\n\n\n\nLook up when the world gets you down\n\nAnd you're gonna get by\n\nHang in when the world counts you out\n\nAnd you're gonna be fine\n\nSometimes that's life, some days nothing ever goes right\n\nBut if your hand is in mine\n\nI'll be floating on cloud nine for the rest of my life\n\nI'll be floating on cloud nine\n\nFor the rest of my life"
