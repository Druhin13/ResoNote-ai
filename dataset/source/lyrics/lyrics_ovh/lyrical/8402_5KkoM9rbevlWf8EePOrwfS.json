  "lyrics": "There's a light at the end where I know\r\nWhere culprits on carpets make sense of it all\r\nAnd the sky is all indigo\r\nAnd the young ones just want to go home\r\nAnd the edge of the world makes it seem\n\nThat everyone gone is still singing the same song\n\nAnd I can believe in these things;\n\nThat everyone's singing along\n\nThe good the bad and the gone\n\n\n\nThere's a light at the end of a dock\n\nSending green little postcards to a city I love so much\n\nAnd the water makes sense of her laugh\n\nAnd wrinkles the backs of my hands\n\n\n\nThere's a light at the end where I smoke\n\nAnd my name puffs in colors with people I know\n\nThe song that was stuck in her head\n\nBecomes all the words you forget\n\nYet everyone is singing along\n\nThe good and the bad and the gone"
