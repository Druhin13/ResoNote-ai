  "lyrics": "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\r\nEverywhere you go\r\nTake a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again\r\nWith candy canes and silver lanes that glow\r\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nToys in every store\n\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\n\nOn your own front door\n\n\n\nA pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots\n\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben\n\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk\n\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen\n\nAnd mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nEverywhere you go\n\nThere's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well\n\nThe sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nSoon the bells will start\n\nAnd the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\n\nRight within your heart\n\n\n\nI can feel it in the air\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nSoon the bells will start\n\nAnd the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\n\nRight within your heart\n\n\n\nAnd the thing that will make them ring \n\nIs the carol that you sing\n\nRight within your heart\n\nIt's right within your heart, mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah"
