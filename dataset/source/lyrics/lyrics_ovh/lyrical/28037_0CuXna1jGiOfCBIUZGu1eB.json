Its a party in the USA! \n\nYeah!

Its a party in the USA! \n\nYeah! Its a party in the USA! \n\n\n\nFeel like hoppin on a flight (on a flight) \n\nBack to my hometown tonight (town tonight) \n\nSomething stops me everytime (everytime) \n\nThe DJ plays my song and I feel alright \n\n\n\nSo I put my hands up, they're playin my song \n\nThe butterflies fly away, Im noddin my head like Yeah! \n\nMovin my hips like Yeah! \n\nGot my hands up, theyre playin my song \n\nThey know Im gonna be okay \n\nYeah! Its a party in the USA! \n\nYeah! Its a party in the USA! \n\n\n\nSo I put my hands up, they're playin my song \n\nThe butterflies fly away, Im noddin my head like Yeah! \n\nMovin my hips like Yeah! \n\nGot my hands up, theyre playin my song \n\nThey know Im gonna be okay \n\nYeah! Its a party in the USA! \n\nYeah! Its a party in the USA! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Miley for these lyrics and to ccdog55 and pumpkinsara1 for these corrections)"
