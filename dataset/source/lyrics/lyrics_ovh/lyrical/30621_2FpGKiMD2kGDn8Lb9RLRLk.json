  "lyrics": "Weighed down by morning\r\nIn my birthday suit\r\nLift up the evening\r\nJust for a while\r\nBackwards, upside down and inside out\r\nSo hold on or we'll all fall down\n\nOh, heave the oceans too, won't you?\n\n\n\nI'll keep my ears on\n\nI'll keep my eyes open\n\nI'll keep my legs inside and wait 'til we all fall down"
