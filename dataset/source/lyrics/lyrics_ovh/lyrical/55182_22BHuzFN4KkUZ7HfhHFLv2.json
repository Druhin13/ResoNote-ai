  "lyrics": "Where have you been to?\r\nWhere did you go?\r\nDid you follow the summer out\r\nWhen the winter pushed its face in the snow?\r\nOr have you come by again to die again?\n\nWell, try again another time.\n\n\n\nDid you follow\n\nThe crystal swan?\n\nDid you see yourself\n\nDeep inside the velvet pond?\n\n\n\nOr have you come by again to die again?\n\nWell, try again another time.\n\n\n\nWhen you set to shape the world,\n\nWas the shape the shape of you?\n\nOr did you cast enchanting glances\n\nThrough the eye that all men use?\n\n\n\nOr have you come by again to die again?\n\nWell, try again another time.\n\n\n\nDid you find that the universe\n\nDoesn't care at all?\n\nDid you find that if you don't care\n\nThis whole wrong world will fall?\n\n\n\nOr have you come by again to die again?\n\nWell, try again another time.\n\n\n\nDid you ever capture\n\nAll those jewels in the sky?\n\nDid you find that the world outside\n\nIs all inside your mind?\n\n\n\nOr have you come by again to die again?\n\nWell, try again another time."
