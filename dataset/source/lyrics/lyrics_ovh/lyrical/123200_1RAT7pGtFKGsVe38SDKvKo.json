  "lyrics": "Do you know? Do you care?\r\nAre we just passing through moments wasted in time?\r\nCan we be more to this than leave ashes behind?\r\nLightning strikes, the fires rage\r\nTear out the pages from the story of this life\n\nThe cloud of anger left behind\n\nAnd tell the future will we be buried deep or flying high\n\nOr just the anger left behind\n\n\n\nThe light is fading now as stars fill the sky\n\nRaise!\n\nThrow your body to the wolves, lay screaming as you die\n\nTear flesh from bone and lose your mind\n\n\n\nTear out the pages from the story of this life\n\nThe cloud of anger left behind\n\nAnd tell the future will we be buried deep or flying high\n\nOr just the anger left behind\n\n\n\nBe more than anger left behind, left behind\n\nBe more than anger left behind, left behind\n\n\n\nTear out the pages from the story of this life\n\nThe cloud of anger left behind\n\nAnd tell the future will we be buried deep or flying high\n\nOr just the anger left behind\n\nOr just the anger left behind"
