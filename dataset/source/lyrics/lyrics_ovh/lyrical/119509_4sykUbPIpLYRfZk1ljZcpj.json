  "lyrics": "Used to be so judgmental\r\nNow I respect the ones\r\nWho dare to be sinful\r\nI was searching for my pride\r\nNow I know it's all fleeting\r\nJust glad to be alive\n\n\n\nBrontosaurs fear of art is torn apart by making\n\nGood mistakes and branching out, he switch it up like baking\n\nThe more I tried to sleep it off, the more I started thinking\n\nI wanna live in mushroom park, do unrestricted shrinking\n\n\n\nYou're salty, can't fault you\n\nI'm numb to the rhythm that guides you\n\nTake all your confetti away\n\n\n\nI know, I know what's killing me\n\nDon't need your love or sympathy\n\nI know, I know just what you'll say\n\nDon't you try to rescue me\n\n\n\nMade up magic turtle guy is feeling like he's crap\n\nHe needs to spend some time alone to understand his path\n\nThere's different types of waves and things your mind is tuning to\n\nIt takes in information and it sorts it out for you\n\n\n\nWon't fight you, not like you\n\nBut I'm numb to the rhythm that guides you\n\nI'll take your confetti away\n\n\n\nI know, I know what's killing me\n\nDon't need your love or sympathy\n\nI know, I know just what you'll say\n\nDon't you try to rescue me\n\n\n\nDon't you try to rescue me\n\nDon't you try to rescue me\n\n\n\nNow you're on a midnight crusade\n\nFlexing your stats\n\nBut you can't touch me, touch me, touch me\n\nTell me how to think my own way\n\nYou can give it your best\n\nBut you won't touch me, touch me, touch me\n\n\n\nI'm kissing a baby that licking a boot\n\nI live in a deli, put meat on your tooth\n\nMy business is pregnant and flaunting off nude\n\nI'm smoking a chicken, I took out the coupe\n\n\n\nShow off addictions and make it sound fiction\n\nYou aren't doing art if you're dead in the park\n\nIf you feel like you died, show 'em you have\n\nGive up your life for the virtual clap\n\nShear off the weird and then watch 'em appear\n\nNow you're a spiritless fearless lil lyricist\n\nShear off the weird and then watch 'em appear\n\nNow you're a spiritless fearless lil lyricist\n\nHoax"
