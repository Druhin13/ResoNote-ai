  "lyrics": "In the bleak mid-winter all creation groans\r\nFor a world in darkness frozen like a stone\r\nLight is breaking in a stable for a throne\r\nIf I were a wise man, I would travel far\r\nAnd if I were a shepherd, I would do my part\n\nBut poor as I am I will give to Him my heart\n\n\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\nUnto us a child is born\n\nThe King of kings and Lord of lords\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\n\n\nHere within a manger lies\n\nThe One who built the starry skies\n\nThis baby born for sacrifice\n\nChrist, the Messiah\n\nInto our hopes, into our fears\n\nThe Savior of the world appears\n\nThe promise of eternal years\n\nChrist, the Messiah\n\n\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\n\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\nUnto us a child is born\n\nThe King of kings and Lord of lords\n\nAnd He shall reign forevermore, forevermore\n\n\n\nAnd He shall reign\n\nHe shall reign\n\nHe shall reign forevermore"
