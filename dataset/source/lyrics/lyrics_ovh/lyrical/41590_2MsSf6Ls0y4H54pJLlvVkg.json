  "lyrics": "It's the 11th of November down in Nashville Tennessee\r\nFree breakfast at the Waffle House if I show 'em my I.D\r\nA parade up on the riverfront, you can hear the trumpets play\r\nHands on hearts, the color guard kicks it off on Veterans Day\r\nAnd they thank me for my service and wave their little flags\n\nThey genuflect on Sundays and yes, they'd send us back\n\nBut I believe in God and country and in the angels up on high?\n\nAnd in heaven shining down on us through bullet holes in the sky\n\n\n\nWaitress asks me how I'm doing but I don't know what to say\n\nI was thinking bout the battlefield the night I learned to pray\n\nMarchers wind their way down Main Street the crowd begins to cheer\n\nI feel my chest exploding as my eyes fill up with tears\n\n\n\nThey thank me for my service and wave their little flags\n\nThey genuflect on Sundays and yes, they'd send us back\n\nBut I believe in God and country and in the angels up on high?\n\nAnd in heaven shining down on us through bullet holes in the sky\n\n\n\nOh Jesus said forgive them, they know not what they do\n\nAnd he's here with me this morning and his words they still ring true\n\nSo I hang my head and pray for those we lost and those who remain\n\nAs the clouds burst over Nashville - it begins to rain\n\n\n\nAnd they thank me for my service and wave their little flags\n\nThey genuflect on Sundays and yesm they'd send us back\n\nBut I believe in God and country and in the angels up on high?\n\nAnd in heaven shining down on us through bullet holes in the sky\n\nAnd in heaven shining down on us through bullet holes in the sky"
