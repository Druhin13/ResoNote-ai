  "lyrics": "I'm sure it was nothing\r\nBut you never used to bring somebody else along\r\nUsed to be our thing\r\nGoing to a movie, then we wander home\r\nAll these little landmines\r\nAll these little things that one can read two ways\n\nLike when you take every call outside\n\nSeems that I’ve forgotten how to read your face\n\nBut I know you too well to get it wrong\n\n\n\nIf you have to hurt me, hurt me once\n\nIf you have to end it, get it done\n\nYou have all these choices, I have none\n\nYou're all that I have to lose\n\nCouldn't hurt you if I wanted to\n\nI’ve decided on you\n\n\n\nIf you keep it going\n\nThen one by one, the memories will start to blur\n\nYou'll ruin the good ones\n\nBut I guess my photo album's none of your concern\n\nDon't humor me with kindness\n\nThere's nothing kind about a hundred small betrayals\n\nIf you love me at all, you'll kill it now\n\n\n\nIf you have to hurt me, hurt me once\n\nIf you have to end it, get it done\n\nYou have all these choices, I have none\n\nYou're all that I have to lose\n\nCouldn't hurt you if I wanted to\n\nI decided on you, I’ve decided on you\n\n\n\nAnd if I’m disappointed\n\nIt's ’cause you're not the person I knew\n\nIf I had it my way, I'd be kinder than you\n\nI'm sure I’ll forgive you, and soon\n\nI'm ashamed that I'm proud of it, too\n\nI decided on you"
