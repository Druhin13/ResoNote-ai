Yeah\n\nBut I guess that's what we're used to\n\n\n\nAll of my time, for you\n\nAll of my lines are used\n\n\n\nOh, I know you're really hurtin' a lot right now\n\nLet me help you\n\nHelp you out\n\nDon't you think I'm feeling something, too\n\nWhen you're walking on a wire\n\nAnd everything's on fire, fire\n\n\n\nOh, I know you're really hurtin' a lot right now\n\nLet me help you\n\nHelp you out\n\nDon't you think I'm feeling something, too\n\nWhen you're walking on a wire\n\nAnd everything's on fire, fire\n\n\n\nTake my love, my hate\n\nSave the family then save face\n\nYou can take my place\n\nLive my ways\n\nI know you\n\nWhat we've been through\n\nI said I do, I meant it, didn't you?\n\n\n\nI know you're really hurtin' a lot right now\n\nLet me help you\n\nHelp you out\n\nDon't you think I'm feeling something, too\n\nWhen you're walking on a wire\n\nAnd everything's on fire, fire\n\n\n\nOh, I know you're really hurtin' a lot right now\n\nLet me help you\n\nHelp you out\n\nDon't you think I see something in you\n\nWhen you're walking on a wire\n\nAnd everything's on fire, fire\n\n\n\n(I know you're really hurtin' a lot right now.)"
