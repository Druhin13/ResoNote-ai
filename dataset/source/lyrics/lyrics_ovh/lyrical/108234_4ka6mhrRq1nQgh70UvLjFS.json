  "lyrics": "A perfect day, the sun is sinkin' low\r\nAs evening falls, the gentle breezes blow\r\nThe time we shared went by so fast\r\nJust like a dream, we knew it couldn't last\r\nBut I'd do it all again\r\nIf I could, somehow\n\nBut I must be leavin' soon\n\nIt's your world now\n\n\n\nIt's your world now\n\nMy race is run\n\nI'm moving on\n\nLike the setting sun\n\nNo sad goodbyes\n\nNo tears allowed\n\nYou'll be alright\n\nIt's your world now\n\n\n\nEven when we are apart\n\nYou'll always be in my heart\n\nWhen dark clouds appear in the sky\n\nRemember true love never dies\n\n\n\nBut first a kiss, one glass of wine\n\nJust one more dance while there's still time\n\nMy one last wish: someday, you'll see\n\nHow hard I tried and how much you meant to me\n\n\n\nIt's your world now\n\nUse well the time\n\nBe part of something good\n\nLeave something good behind\n\nThe curtain falls\n\nI take my bow\n\nThat's how it's meant to be\n\nIt's your world now\n\nIt's your world now\n\nIt's your world now"
