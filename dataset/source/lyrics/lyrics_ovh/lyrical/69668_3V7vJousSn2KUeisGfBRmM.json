  "lyrics": "Â© Bob McDill\r\nUniversal Polygram International Publishing Inc.\r\n\r\nOh all I needed, was one look\r\nOne magic moment, was all it took\n\nFrom that moment, I loved you so\n\nNow that I've found you I'm never going to let you go\n\n\n\nSo come on say it, say it again\n\nIt sounds so good, say it one more time and then\n\nIf you mean it say it again\n\nThe hard part's over and the loving part begins\n\n\n\nOh hold me closer, make me warm\n\nI feel wanted here in your arms\n\nI've been lonely for too long\n\nI've waited a life time for you to come along\n\n\n\nSo come on say it, say it again\n\nIt sounds so good, say it one more time and then\n\nIf you mean it say it again\n\nThe hard part's over and the loving part begins\n\n\n\nCome on say it, say it again\n\nIt sounds so good, say it one more time and then\n\nIf you mean it say it again\n\nThe hard part's over and the loving part begins"
