  "lyrics": "I've been climbing up the walls\r\nTo escape the sinking feeling\r\nBut I can't hide from the nihilist at my door\r\nBuried in the basement floor\r\nDidn't know what I had planted\r\nIt blossomed with all the heart of a Cold War\n\n\n\nI'm a spirit in a tomb\n\nWon't somebody raise the roof\n\nI'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue\n\nDo you mind if I'm exhumed?\n\nI'm the ashes in the plume\n\nI'm a beggar in the ruin\n\nI'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through\n\nI'm only lonely for the true\n\n\n\nParadise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out\n\nI'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth\n\nParadise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out\n\nI'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nParadise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out\n\nI'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\n\n\nLight as a feather, stiff as a board\n\nSink to the floor, I sink to the floor\n\nI sink to the floor\n\nLight as a feather, stiff as a board\n\n\n\nYou were in my dream last night\n\nBut your face was someone else's\n\nA twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder\n\nIsolation neophyte\n\nToo afraid to taste your conscience\n\nYou march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter\n\n\n\nI'm a spirit in a tomb\n\nWon't somebody raise the roof\n\nI'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue\n\nDo you mind if I'm exhumed?\n\nI'm the ashes in the plume\n\nI'm a beggar in the ruin\n\nI'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through\n\nI'm only lonely for the true\n\n\n\nParadise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out\n\nI'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nParadise is in my soul, and I'm terrified I can't get out\n\nI'm lost in a labyrinth, we are lost in a labyrinth\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\nPlease, don't follow\n\n\n\nI've been climbing up the walls\n\nTo escape the sinking feeling\n\nBut I can't hide from the nihilist at my door"
