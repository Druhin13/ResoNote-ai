  "lyrics": "Shovel on my hands, sweat on my shirt\r\nBeen workin' for a while boys, on this pile of dirt\r\nTryin' to dig a little deeper, in a hard rock town\r\nNo it ain't easy, breakin' new ground\r\nBurnin' in the hot sun, soakin' in the rain\r\nGettin' pretty good at, smilin' through the pain\n\nAbout to the point where, most turn around\n\nNo it ain't easy, breakin' new ground\n\n\n\nIt's a long hard day, but you sleep at night\n\nIt's an inch by inch push on down the line\n\nOnly one way through, just get up and do\n\nIt again, and again, and again, and again, and again\n\n\n\nIt's gonna take time and its gonna take heart\n\nYeah that bedrock baby it don't just fall apart\n\nIf you're lookin' for the good stuff, it's a little further down\n\nIt sure ain't easy, breakin' new ground\n\n\n\nIt's a long hard day, but you sleep at night\n\nIt's an inch by inch push on down the line\n\nOnly one way through, just get up and do\n\nIt again, and again, and again, and again, and again\n\n\n\nIf you want it bad enough, no you won't back down\n\nBut it ain't easy, breakin' new ground\n\nIt ain't easy, breakin' new ground\n\n\n\nShovel on my hands, sweat on my shirt\n\nIt ain't easy"
