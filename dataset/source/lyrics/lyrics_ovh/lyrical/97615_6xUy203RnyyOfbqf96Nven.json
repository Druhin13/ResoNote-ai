  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Selfish par Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike\r\nI don't mind you hanging with your friends\nIt's just I like it more when the party ends\nSo we can turn the lights down, you and me now\nWith you every day is like a weekend\nI know they wanna steal your heart away\nSo I just wanna keep you here with me\nI'm never gonna let go, wanna stay close\nLet me do it just how you want it\n\nI want you all to myself\nI want you all to myself\nYour body is turning me reckless\nI want you all to myself\nI want you all to myself\nOoh baby, you're making me selfish\n\n\nYou make me, you make me\nYou make me selfish\nYou make me, you make me\nYou make me selfish\n\nI don't mind you making other plans\nIt's just I like it more when they don't happen\nSo we can order takeout, chill on my couch\nGot me looking good in my sweatpants\nDid you know that posh up town events\nAre full of fake actors? No offence\nI just wanna wake up with my make-up\nSmeared on your sheets, makin' no sense\n\nI want you all to myself\nI want you all to myself\nYour body is turning me reckless\nI want you all to myself\n\nI want you all to myself\nOoh baby, you're making me selfish\n\nYou make me, you make me\nYou make me, you make me selfish\nYou make me, you make me\nI want you all to myself\n\nI don't mind you hanging with your friends\nIt's just I like it more when the party ends\nIt's just I like it more when the party ends\nI want you all to myself\n\nI want you all to myself\nI want you all to myself\nYour body is turning me reckless\nI want you all to myself\nI want you all to myself\n\nOoh baby, you're making me selfish"
