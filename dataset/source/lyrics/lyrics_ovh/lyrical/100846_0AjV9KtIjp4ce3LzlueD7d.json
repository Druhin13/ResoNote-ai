  "lyrics": "When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed\r\nWith a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head\r\nThen daddy came in to kiss his little man\r\nWith gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand\r\nHe talked about honor and things I should know\r\nThen he staggered a little as he went out the door\n\n\n\nI can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees\n\nAnd those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me\n\nHank and Tennessee\n\nI guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be\n\nSo what do you do with good ole boys like me\n\n\n\nNothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does\n\nBut you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was\n\nThe smell of Cape Jasmine through the window screen\n\nJohn R. and the Wolfman kept me company\n\nBy the light of the radio by my bed\n\nWith Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head\n\n\n\nI can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees\n\nAnd those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me\n\nHank and Tennessee\n\nI guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be\n\nSo what do you do with good ole boys like me\n\n\n\nWhen I was in school I ran with a kid down the street\n\nAnd I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed\n\nBut I was smarter than most and I could choose\n\nLearned to talk like the man on the six o'clock news\n\nWhen I was eighteen Lord I hit the road but it really didn't matter how far I go\n\n\n\nI can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees\n\nAnd those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me\n\nHank and Tennessee\n\nI guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be\n\nSo what do you do with good ole boys like me\n\nYeah what do you do with good ole boys like me"
