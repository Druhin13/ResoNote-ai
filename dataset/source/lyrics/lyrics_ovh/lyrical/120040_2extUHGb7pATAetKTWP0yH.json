  "lyrics": "Do you recall the days at your old place?\r\nPlaying with Troll dolls to scare the kids away\r\nMy closet was a time machine, yours a stage\r\nI wish we told those little girls they're gonna be okay\r\nStill picture it all in my mind\r\nMaking the campfire out of broken flashlights\n\nJealous of your high tops 'cause someone stole mine\n\nWish somebody would've told me that would be alright\n\n\n\nMy kind of time's meant to carelessly spend\n\nAnd my kind of nights are the one's that don't end\n\nMy kind of fun doesn't make any sense\n\nAnd my kind of love, you won't ever forget\n\nMy kind of time's meant to carelessly spend\n\nAnd my kind of nights are the one's that don't end\n\nMy kind of fun doesn't make any sense\n\nAnd my kind of love, you won't ever forget\n\n\n\nDo you remember all the cartoons at midnight?\n\nLike the one about the crass-humoured French guy\n\nAnd what about you, Mr. Poetry?\n\nAnd what about all that we built in just a couple weeks?\n\nTalkin' 'bout all of our fears through a cracked screen\n\nPicking little fights over falling asleep\n\nI wish you knew I loved you when you knew you loved me\n\nReally wish I knew you sooner than my 20s\n\n\n\nMy kind of time's meant to carelessly spend\n\nAnd my kind of nights are the one's that don't end\n\nMy kind of fun doesn't make any sense\n\nAnd my kind of love, you won't ever forget\n\nMy kind of time's meant to carelessly spend\n\nAnd my kind of nights are the one's that don't end\n\nMy kind of fun doesn't make any sense\n\nAnd my kind of love, you won't ever forget\n\n\n\nI'm a product of the who's, when's, and how's\n\nThose who let go and those who stuck around\n\nI wish somebody would've told me I'd be here now\n\n'Cause this kind of life is one to sing about (Oh yeah)\n\n\n\nMy kind of time's meant to carelessly spend\n\nAnd my kind of nights are the one's that don't end\n\nMy kind of fun doesn't make any sense\n\nAnd my kind of love, you won't ever forget\n\nMy kind of time's meant to carelessly spend\n\nAnd my kind of nights are the one's that don't end\n\nMy kind of fun doesn't make any sense\n\nAnd my kind of love, you won't ever forget\n\n\n\nMy kind of love you, won't ever forget\n\nWish somebody would've told me that would be alright"
