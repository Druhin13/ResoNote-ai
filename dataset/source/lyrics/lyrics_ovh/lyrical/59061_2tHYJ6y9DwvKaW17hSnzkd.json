  "lyrics": "I know I'm probably better off on my own\r\nThan lovin' a man who didn't know\r\nWhat he had when he had it\r\nAnd I see the permanent damage you did to me\r\nNever again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic\r\nI wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror\n\nSaying to myself, you know you had to do it\n\nI know the bravest thing I ever did was run\n\n\n\nSometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again\n\nBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man\n\nAnd I know why we had to say goodbye\n\nLike the back of my hand\n\nAnd I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man\n\nA better man\n\n\n\nI know I'm probably better off all alone\n\nThan needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute\n\nAnd it's always on your terms\n\nI'm hanging on every careless word\n\nHoping it might turn sweet again\n\nLike it was in the beginning\n\nBut your jealousy, I can hear it now\n\nYou're talking down to me like I'll always be around\n\nYou push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun\n\nBoy, you never thought I'd run\n\n\n\nSometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again\n\nBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man\n\nAnd I know why we had to say goodbye\n\nLike the back of my hand\n\nAnd I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man\n\nA better man\n\nBetter man\n\n\n\nI hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have\n\nAnd I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that\n\nYou can't say that\n\nI wish you were a better man\n\nI wonder what we would've become\n\nIf you were a better man\n\nWe might still be in love\n\nIf you were a better man\n\nYou would've been the one\n\nIf you were a better man\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nSometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again\n\nBut I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man\n\nAnd I know why we had to say goodbye\n\nLike the back of my hand\n\nAnd I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man\n\nA better man\n\nBetter man\n\n\n\nWe might still be in love, if you were a better man\n\nBetter man"
