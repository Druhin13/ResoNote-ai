  "lyrics": "Nobody here knocking at my door\r\nThe sound of silence I can't take anymore\r\nNobody ringing my telephone now\r\nOh how I miss such a beautiful sound\r\nAnd I don't even know how I survive\n\nI won't make it to the shore without your light\n\nNo I don't even know if I'm alive\n\nOh, oh, oh without you now\n\nThis is what it feels like\n\n\n\nNothing to hold but the memories and frames\n\nOh they remind me of the battle I face\n\nwithout your love, without you I drown\n\nSomebody save me I'm going down\n\n\n\nAnd I don't even know how I survive\n\nI won't make it to the shore without your light\n\nNo I don't even know if I'm alive\n\nOh, oh, oh without you now\n\nThis is what it feels like\n\n\n\nAnd I don't even know how I survive\n\nI won't make it to the shore without your light\n\nNo I don't even know if I'm alive\n\nOh, oh, oh without you now\n\nThis is what it feels like"
