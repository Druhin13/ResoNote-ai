  "lyrics": "Sometimes I'm dreaming of the past\r\nMaking love in the summer while it lasts\r\nBut life ain't easy as it seemed\r\nMuch tougher and louder than I dreamed\r\nI thought I was living in paradise\n\nAnd those were the days of my life\n\n\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nThey never look back\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nThey don't know\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nJust wanna have fun\n\nAll of their life still to go\n\n\n\nThe older they get they'll be wiser\n\nSometimes even up to compromise\n\nThe energy, the power, their will to survive\n\nDon't feel for a job from 9 to 5\n\n\n\nThey think they are living in paradise\n\nAnd these are the days of their lives\n\n\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nThey never look back\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nThey don't know\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nJust wanna have fun\n\nAll of their life still to go\n\n\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nThey never look back\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nThey don't know\n\nThe wild and the young\n\nJust wanna have fun\n\nAll of their life still to go\n\n\n\nThe wild and the young"
