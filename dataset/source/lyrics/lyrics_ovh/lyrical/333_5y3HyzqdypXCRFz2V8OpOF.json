  "lyrics": "Last flare from the lifeboat\r\nLast air in my lungs\r\nRight now even I know that you've got someone\r\nSome people see the diamond\r\nSome can only see the flaws\r\nWe make perfect little movies than no one ever saw\n\n\n\nDidn't know that forever only meant forever till you found someone better\n\nSome day's gonna hit you, see you crystal clear like a photograph\n\n\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nI seen you mine, you can always find me in the way way back\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nGonna love you like that\n\nGonna love you like that\n\n\n\nI'm sure he's easier than I was\n\nIf you like that sort of things\n\nHe looks better with the shirt off, yeah, but can he sing?\n\nWhen sun setting early and my shadow's getting long\n\nBaby I just wanna hurt me, put you in every song\n\n\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nI seen you mine, you can always find me in the way way back\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nGonna love you like that\n\nGonna love you like that\n\n\n\nDidn't know that forever only meant forever till you found someone better\n\nSome day's gonna hit you see you crystal clear like a photograph\n\n\n\nNo, no one else's gonna love you like that\n\nNo, no one else's gonna love you like that\n\nI seen you mine, you can always find me in the way way back\n\nNo one else's gonna love you like that\n\nGonna love you like that\n\nGonna love you like that"
