  "lyrics": "I been walking\r\nTalking to myself\r\nFollowing words in my garden\r\nFlowers burn and turn\r\nBack to the sun\r\nIt begins, I run\n\n\n\nI should've loved you the first time\n\nYou were so bright, I was so blind\n\nI could've said that you were all mine\n\nWhy did I leave you on my fault line?\n\n\n\nIs it a thing to die for\n\nHeavy heart of gold\n\nA thing to lie for\n\nThis something that I sold\n\nI've been walking\n\nWalking from myself\n\nFollowing you\n\nTo my only fear\n\n\n\nI should've loved you the first time\n\nYou were so bright, I was so blind\n\nI could've said that you were all mine\n\nWhy did I leave you on my fault line?\n\n\n\nRunning 'round this crazy town\n\nIt's a cold night in the mean streets\n\nFalling out, falling in\n\nAnd all I can hear is your hands\n\nStanding here, waiting there\n\nIt's a white light in a blue room\n\nI'm on fire, I confide\n\nI'm a twisted fucked up fool I know\n\n\n\nAnd I should've loved you the first time\n\nYou were so bright, I was so blind\n\nI could've said that you were all mine\n\nWhy did I leave you on my fault line?\n\n\n\nI should've loved you the first time\n\nYou were so bright, I was so blind\n\nI could've said that you were all mine\n\nWhy did I leave you on my fault line?"
