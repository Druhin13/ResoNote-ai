Ha, ha ,ha!\n\nLadies and gentlemen!\n\nIf you're sick of being disrespected\n\nLet me hear you sing it!\n\nGo!\n\nI don't wanna feel like my money that you're spending\n\nNo, I don't wanna feel like I'm losing 'cause you're winning, baby\n\nI don't wanna feel like my money that you're spending\n\nNo, I don't wanna feel like I'm losing 'cause you're winning\n\n\n\nI won't be used\n\nMy mama didn't raise no fool\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging\n\nSo cut me loose\n\nMy mama didn't raise no fool\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging, no more\n\nI won't be used\n\nMy mama didn't raise no fool\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging\n\nSo, cut me loose\n\nMy mama didn't raise no fool\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging, no more\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging, no more (No more, no more)\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging\n\nWon't let you leave me hanging"
