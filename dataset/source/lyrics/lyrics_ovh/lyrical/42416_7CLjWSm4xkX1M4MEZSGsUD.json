  "lyrics": "You came into my life unexpectedly\r\nYou saw my imperfections\r\nAnd you saw who I am\r\nThrough all my insecurities\r\nYou stood by me\r\nSo I love you for the peace that you bring to my soul\n\nHigh and low I've searched\n\nYou're the only one for me\n\n\n\nYou're my person in my home\n\nYou are real you're my earth\n\nYou're a million dollar things\n\nThat you don't even know\n\nYou're my sun you're my rain\n\nYou're the twinkle in my eye\n\nOh I wish I found you sooner\n\nSo that I, I can love you longer\n\n\n\nYou told me how to feel so beautiful\n\nTo forgive all my faults, to accept all my flaws\n\nThrough all my insanities\n\nYou love and feel so I love you for all rightness you bring to my soul\n\nHigh and low I've searched\n\nYou're the only one for me\n\n\n\nYou're my person in my home\n\nYou are real you're my earth\n\nYou're a million dollar things\n\nThat you don't even know\n\nYou're my sun you're my rain\n\nYou're the twinkle in my eye\n\nOh I wish I found you sooner\n\nSo that I, I can love you longer\n\n\n\nI've searched high and low for you\n\nBut times get the best for lesson\n\nI've never felt so sure in my life\n\nYou're the only one for me\n\n\n\nYou're my person, you're my home\n\nYou are real you're my earth\n\nYou're a million dollar things\n\nThat you don't even know\n\nYou're my sun, you're my rain\n\nYou're the twinkle in my eye\n\nOh I wish I found you sooner\n\nSo that I, I can love you longer"
