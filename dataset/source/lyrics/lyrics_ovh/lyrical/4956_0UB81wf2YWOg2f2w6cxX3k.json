  "lyrics": "I'm either all in or all out\r\nI'm in the wooden pew Sunday party crowd\r\nIf no one else will drink it then you know I will\r\nAnd wake up in the morning with some Baptist guilt\r\nEvery tattoo's got a story to tell\r\nMama said she's prayin' hard to keep me outta hell\n\nBut whiskey tastes better when you chase it with a beer\n\nBut I ain't telling nothing new to nobody here\n\n\n\nIf I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nRaise your hands a little higher\n\nIf you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song\n\nLet me see you sparking up your lighters\n\nPour a little payday on the fire\n\nIf you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream\n\nThen you're just like me\n\nAnd I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nPreachin' to the choir\n\n\n\nI ain't rich but I'm grateful\n\nEvery time I'm driving with a tank full\n\n\"Simple Man\" coming through the dashboard speakers\n\nI'm a southern rock sinner, believer\n\n\n\nIf I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nRaise your hands a little higher\n\nIf you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song\n\nLet me see you sparking up your lighters\n\nPour a little payday on the fire\n\nIf you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream\n\nThen you're just like me\n\nAnd I'm preachin' to the choir\n\n\n\nNothing like bourbon and the blues\n\nSmoke ring hallelu's\n\nBreaking our backs, bending the rules\n\nSouthern dry, deep-fried, hearts of gold\n\nHell, but you already know\n\n\n\nThat's right!\n\n\n\nCause I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nRaise your hands a little higher\n\nIf you wanna sing along to a Saturday night revival song\n\nLet me see you sparking up your lighters\n\nPour a little payday on the fire\n\nIf you're a forty drinking, forty working, living the dream\n\nThen you're just like me\n\nAnd I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nYeah, I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nI'm either all in or all out\n\nCause I'm preachin' to the choir\n\nThat's right!"
