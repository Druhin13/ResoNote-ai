  "lyrics": "Well I've heard that the devil is walking around\r\nI sold my soul way down in the dirt\r\nBut stole it back now forever in debt\r\nAnd for a moment I don't even carre\r\nUntil I felt his breath at my neck\r\nAnd maybe even you can feel it too\n\nHis on a strike and looking at you\n\n\n\nHolding on to his words but baby I saw an angel become the devil\n\nStill they walk pretty good hand in hand\n\nBut baby I don't need any of them heaven nor hell\n\n\n\nWell I've heard that the morning star of a prince\n\nWas invoked on a Monday on earth\n\nI found his business card in the mud\n\nAnd for a moment I don't even care\n\nUntil I felt his breath at my neck\n\nAnd maybe even you can feel it too\n\nHis on a strike and looking for you\n\n\n\nEvil came down to earth\n\nAnd it beholds more than you love more than you love\n\nHeaven don't fall on earth\n\nWhat you behold is no longer a word"
