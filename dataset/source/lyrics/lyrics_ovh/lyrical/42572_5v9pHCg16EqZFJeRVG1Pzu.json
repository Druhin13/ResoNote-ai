  "lyrics": "Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair\r\nFirst time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair\r\nHad to get her number, it took me like six weeks\r\nNow me and her go way back like Cadillac seats\r\nBody like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed\n\nI know every curve like the back of my hand\n\nDoin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry\n\nI'ma take it slow just as fast as I can\n\n\n\nThe way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt\n\nBut I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help\n\nGot hips like honey, so thick and so sweet\n\nIt ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets\n\n\n\nBody like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed\n\nI know every curve like the back of my hand\n\nDoin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry\n\nI'ma take it slow just as fast as I can\n\n\n\nWe're out here in the boondocks\n\nWith the breeze and the birds\n\nTangled up in the tall grass\n\nWith my lips on hers\n\nOn the highway to heaven\n\nHeaded south of her smile\n\nGet there when we get there\n\nEvery inch is a mile\n\n\n\nBody like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed\n\nI know every curve like the back of my hand\n\nDoin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry\n\nI'ma take it slow just as fast as I can\n\n\n\nI'ma take it slow\n\nAs fast as I can\n\nBody like a back road\n\nDrivin' with my eyes closed\n\nI know every curve like the back of my hand"
