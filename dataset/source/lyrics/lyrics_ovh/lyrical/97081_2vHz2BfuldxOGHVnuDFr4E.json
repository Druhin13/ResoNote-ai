  "lyrics": "Beneath the surface\r\nOf my anxious imagination\r\nBeckons a calmness\r\nThat is found in You alone\r\nIt washes over\r\nEvery doubt, every imperfection\n\nJesus, Your presence\n\nIs the comfort of my soul\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere I’d rather be\n\nWhen You're singing over me\n\nI just wanna be here with You\n\nI'm lost in Your mystery\n\nI’m found in Your love for me\n\nI just wanna be here with You\n\n\n\nHere in the waiting\n\nI won't worry about tomorrow\n\nNo need to focus\n\nOn the things I can't control\n\nAll my attention\n\nOn the wonder of this moment\n\nJesus, Your presence\n\nIs the comfort of my soul\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere I'd rather be\n\nWhen You're singing over me\n\nI just wanna be here with You\n\nI'm lost in Your mystery\n\nI'm found in Your love for me\n\nI just wanna be here with You\n\n\n\n\n\nSo let all that I am\n\nBe consumed with who You are\n\nOh, the glory of Your presence\n\nWhat more could I ask for?\n\nSo let all that I am\n\nBe consumed with who You are\n\nOh, the glory of Your presence\n\nWhat more could I ask for?\n\nSo let all that I am\n\nBe consumed with who You are\n\nOh, the glory of Your presence\n\nWhat more could I ask for?\n\n\n\nThere’s nowhere I’d rather be\n\nWhen You're singing over me\n\nI just wanna be here with You\n\nI’m lost in Your mystery\n\nI'm found in Your love for me\n\nI just wanna be here with You"
