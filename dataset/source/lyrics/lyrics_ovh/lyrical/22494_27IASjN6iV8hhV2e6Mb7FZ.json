  "lyrics": "When he was a kid, he'd be up at five \nTake shots till eight, make the thing drive \nOut after school, back on ice \nThat was his life, he was gonna play in the Big League \nThe Big League \n\n\nNot many ways out of this cold northern town \n\nYou work in the mill and get laid in the ground \n\nIf you're gonna jump it will be with the game \n\nReal fast and tough is the only clear lane to the Big League \n\n\n\nMy boy's gonna play in the Big League \n\nMy boy's gonna turn some heads \n\nMy boy's gonna play in the Big League \n\nMy boy's gonna knock 'em dead \n\nThe Big League \n\n\n\nAll the right moves when he turned eighteen \n\nScholarship and school on a big U.S. team \n\nOut with his girl near Lake McClean \n\nHit a truck doing seventy in the wrong lane \n\nTo the Big League \n\n\n\nMy boy's gonna play in the Big League \n\nMy boy's gonna turn some heads \n\nMy boy's gonna play in the Big League \n\nMy boy's gonna knock 'em dead \n\n\n\nNever can tell what might come down \n\nNever can tell how much you get \n\nJust don't know, no you never can tell \n\n\n\nSometimes at night I can hear the ice crack \n\nIt sounds like thunder and it rips through my back \n\nSometimes in the morning I still hear the sound \n\nIce meets metal... \n\n\"Can't you drive me down to the Big League?\" \n\n\n\nMy boy's gonna play in the Big League \n\nMy boy's gonna turn some heads \n\nMy boy's gonna play in the Big League \n\nMy boy's gonna knock 'em dead \n\n\n\nNever can tell what might come down \n\nNever can tell when you might check out \n\nJust don't know, no you never can tell \n\nSo do right to others like you do to yourself \n\nIn the Big League"
