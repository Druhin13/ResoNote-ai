  "lyrics": "Girl, I ain't too good at saying\r\nWhat I'm feeling deep inside\r\nUsually I hide, just hold it in\r\nBut lookin' at you laying\r\nRight here by my side\r\nI want you to know I love you even when\n\n\n\nYou're not sucking my dick\n\nYou're not squeezing my balls\n\nYou're not licking my asshole with hands up against the wall\n\nI know I tell you all the time\n\nWhen I'm railing you from behind\n\nBaby, even when the fucking has to end\n\nI love you even when\n\n\n\nEven your mouth is moving\n\nAnd you're singing all those words\n\nProbably talkin' 'bout your Ma and Pa and them\n\nEven your bowels and moving\n\nAnd you're squeezing out a turd\n\nSmells like hell but I love you even when\n\n\n\nYou're not jacking me off\n\nYou're not strapping one on\n\nYou're not smacking my ass red and dressing up like my mom\n\nI know I tell you all the time\n\nWhen you're railing me from behind\n\nEven I don't have a ball gag in\n\nI love you even when\n\n\n\nEven when you spend all my money\n\nEven when I have to pretend that you're funny\n\nEven when, even when\n\n\n\nYou're not shaving my sack\n\nYou're not clamping my nips\n\nYou're not doing that weird thing you like to do with your fist\n\nI know I tell you all the time\n\nWhen you put them beads in my behind\n\nRecord it all and send it to your friends\n\nI love you even when\n\n\n\nI love you even when\n\nI love you even when"
