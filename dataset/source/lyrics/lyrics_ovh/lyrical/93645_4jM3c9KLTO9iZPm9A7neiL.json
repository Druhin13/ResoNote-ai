  "lyrics": "A lot of ways to love you, teach me through your eyes\r\nWhat is needed for you, needed in your life?\r\nDon't wanna go shoppin', you want picnics in the park\r\nDo you like mornings? Should we do it in the dark?\r\nIt's all foreign to me, I don't speak what you speak\n\nI'll commit to learnin' if you, if you\n\nYou're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs\n\nPlease be patient with me, with you\n\n\n\nSaid I wanna be fluent in your love language\n\nLearnin' your love language\n\nI know I don't speak your language\n\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\nFluent in your love language\n\nLearnin' your love language\n\nI know I don't speak your language\n\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\n\n\nNever wanna get lost in translation\n\nNever wanna be on two separate pages\n\nSwear to me that you'll state facts\n\nIf you can take back, know I can take that\n\nI been workin' at it, hoping that you'd notice\n\nI been waitin', I just needed you to focus\n\nSwear to me that you'll show me\n\nNeed you to coach me, then we can proceed\n\n\n\nAnd still, it's all foreign to me, I don't speak what you speak\n\nI'll commit to learnin' if you, if you\n\nYou're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs\n\nPlease be patient with me, with you\n\n\n\nSaid I wanna be fluent in your love language (Your love)\n\nLearnin' your love language (Oh)\n\nI know I don't speak your language (No)\n\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\nFluent in your love language (Love)\n\nLearnin' your love language (Love)\n\nI know I don't speak your language (No)\n\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\n\n\n\n\nSaid I wanna be fluent in your love language\n\nLearnin' your love language\n\nI know I don't speak your language\n\nBut I wanna know more, baby\n\nFluent in your love language (Love)\n\nLearnin' your love language (Love)\n\nI know I don't speak your language (No)\n\nBut I wanna know more, baby"
