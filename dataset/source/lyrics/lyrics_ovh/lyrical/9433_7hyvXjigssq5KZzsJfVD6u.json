  "lyrics": "We were the kids that left home probably too young\r\nBut we took our share and maybe then some\r\nTired of beatings and battles and being sewn up\r\nBut that made us grow up, and that made 'em scared\r\nCause we never learned to keep our voices down\n\nNo, we only learned to shout\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nAnd we earned what we could from the ground up\n\nAnd tried to lift the whole damn crowd up\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\n\n\nWe fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nWe fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\n\n\nAnd there's still a kid somewhere that needs to hear this\n\nThat somebody cares, that somebody knows\n\nWho's tired of bleeding and battered and being torn up\n\nJust pick yourself up, it's time to go\n\n\n\nCause we never learned to keep our voices down\n\nNo, we only learned to shout\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nAnd we earned what we could from the ground up\n\nAnd tried to lift the whole damn crowd up\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\n\n\nWe fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nWe fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\n\n\nMaybe we found a way to make some tracks\n\nWe didn't snicker and turn our backs\n\nWe just keep digging in, and digging in, and giving back\n\n\n\nCause we never learned to keep our voices down\n\nNo, we only learned to shout\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nAnd we earned what we could from the ground up\n\nAnd tried to lift the whole damn crowd up\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nCause we never learned to keep our voices down\n\nNo, we only learned to shout\n\nSo we fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\n\n\nWe fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out\n\nWe fight our way in\n\nAnd we fight our way out"
