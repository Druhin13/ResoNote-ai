  "lyrics": "Imagine being dead with a bullet in your head\r\nWould you want a second chance?\r\nFace down in a cage, with both your wrists slit\r\nWould you think of the life you've had?\r\nClutching at your chest in a cardiac arrest\r\nWould it all make sense to you?\n\nYou finally realize it, hit you right between the eyes\n\nDo you know what you wanna do?\n\nDo you know what you wanna do?\n\nWhen you think of the life you've had\n\nDo you want a second chance?\n\n\n\nWhen you think of all the ways you could die\n\nDoes it make you wanna try?\n\nWhen you're at the end of your rope\n\nDo you wanna give up hope?\n\nWhen you hear that graveyard call\n\nDoes it make you wanna go for it all?\n\nThen go for it all\n\n\n\nImagine you're inside of a white chalk line\n\nWould you finally wanna live?\n\nYour whole life passes by in a flash before your eyes\n\nDid you give all that you got to give?\n\nYou're staring down death and you take your last breath\n\nWhat would you wish that you could do?\n\nWhen you know your number's up did you really do enough?\n\nWould you finally see the truth?\n\nDo you know what you wanna do?\n\nWhen you think of the life you've had\n\nDo you want a second chance?\n\n\n\nWhen you think of all the ways you could die\n\nDoes it make you wanna try?\n\nWhen you're at the end of your rope\n\nDo you wanna give up hope?\n\nWhen you hear that graveyard call\n\nDoes it make you wanna go for it all?\n\nThen go for it all\n\nYeah!\n\n\n\nWhen you think of all the ways you could die\n\nDoes it make you wanna try?\n\nWhen you're at the end of your rope\n\nDo you wanna give up hope?\n\nWhen you hear that graveyard call\n\nDoes it make you wanna go for it all?\n\nThen go for it all\n\nYeah!\n\n\n\nYou've got to go, you gotta go for it all\n\nYou've got to go, you gotta go for it all"
