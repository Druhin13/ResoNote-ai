  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Nobody Compares To You par Gryffin\r\nThought I saw you at our bar last night\nHid in the bathroom, I just couldn't say hi\n\n'Cause I took so much time to reset my life\nBut in just one look, I'm back\nForget that I could have anyone I like\nBut now all I remember is what we had\n\nNobody, nobody, nobody compares to you\nSomebody, somebody please help me get over you\n'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time\nIn all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces\nNobody compares to you, ooh-oh\nNobody compares to you, ooh-oh\nNobody compares to you\n\n\nNobody compares to you\nNobody compares to you\n\nWhat should I do?\nMaybe I'll move away\nStart somewhere new, I'll let you have LA\n\n'Cause I took so much time to reset my life\nBut in just one look, I'm back\nForget that I could have anyone I like\nBut now all I remember is what we had\n\nNobody, nobody, nobody compares to you\nSomebody, somebody please help me get over you\n'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time\nIn all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces\nNobody compares to you\nNobody compares to you\n\nNobody compares to you\n\nNobody compares to you\nNobody compares to you\n\nYou're once in a lifetime\nBetter than New Year's at midnight\nWanna grab on and hold tight\nAnd I won't let go\nI hope you can hear this\n'Cause it's your face that I miss\nYour lips I wanna kiss\n\nNobody, nobody, nobody compares to you\nSomebody, somebody please help me get over you\n'Cause it feels like I've been wasting my time\nIn all the wrong places, on all the wrong faces\nNobody compares to you\n\n\nNobody compares to you\nNobody, nobody, nobody compares to you"
