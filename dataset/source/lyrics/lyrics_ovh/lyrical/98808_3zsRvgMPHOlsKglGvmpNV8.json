  "lyrics": "Ain't got no riches, ain't got no money that runs long\r\nBut I got a heart that's strong and a love that's tall\r\nAin't got no name, ain't got no fancy education\r\nBut I can see right through, a powdered face on a painted fool\r\nLet me slip through (Let me slip through)\r\nWhy you tryna hold me back? (I ain't)\n\nI'm just tryna move up front\n\nLil more of this, lil less of that (Can you feel me?)\n\nLet me come through (Let me come through)\n\nI'm tired being in the back (Aight)\n\nI'm just tryna move up front\n\nA lil more of this, a lil less of that, yeah\n\n\n\nThey tell me I was born to lose\n\nBut I made a good good thing out of bad bad news\n\n\n\nI don't worry, don't worry, don't worry about people in my face\n\nI hit 'em with the style and grace, and watch their ankles break\n\nI know you wish, I know you wish I would fade away\n\nBut I got more to say, Lord they pray\n\nLet me slip through (Let me slip through)\n\nWhy you tryna hold me back? (I ain't)\n\nI'm just tryna move up front\n\nLil more of this, lil less of that (Can you feel me?)\n\nLet me come through (Let me come through)\n\nI'm tired being in the back (Aight)\n\nI'm just trynna move up front\n\nA lil more of this, a lil less of that, yeah\n\nThey tell me I was born to lose\n\nBut I made a good good thing out of bad bad news\n\n\n\nAlright alright, all day all night\n\nAlright alright, all day all night\n\nAlright alright, all day all night\n\nAlright alright, all day all night\n\nThey tell me I was born to lose\n\nBut I made a good good thing out of bad bad news"
