  "lyrics": "Every stone that makes you stumble\r\nAnd cuts you when you fall\r\nEvery serpent here that strikes your heel\r\nTo curse you when you crawl\r\nThe king of love one day will crush them all\n\nAnd every sad seduction, and every clever lie\n\nEvery word that woos and wounds the pilgrim, children of the sky\n\nThe king of love will break them by and by\n\n\n\nAnd you will rise up in the end\n\nYou will rise up in the end\n\nI know the night is cruel\n\nBut the day is coming soon\n\nWhen you will rise up in the end\n\n\n\nIf a thief had come to plunder\n\nWhen the children were alone\n\nIf he ravaged every daughter\n\nAnd murdered every son\n\nWould not the father see this?\n\nWould not his anger burn?\n\nWould he not repay the tyrant\n\nIn the day of his return?\n\nAwait, await the day of his return\n\n\n\nCause he will rise up in the end\n\nHe will rise up in the end\n\nI know you need a savior\n\nHe's patient in his anger\n\nBut he will rise up in the end\n\n\n\nAnd when the stars come crashing to the sea\n\nWhen the high and mighty fall down on their knee\n\nWe'll see the sun descending in the sky\n\nThe chains of death will fall around your feet\n\n\n\nAnd you will rise up in the end\n\nYou will rise up in the end\n\nYou will rise up in the end\n\nI know you will"
