  "lyrics": "I need a change of scene 'til the seasons change\r\nMaybe longer nights, maybe shorter days\r\nWill get me over what I can't get past\r\nIf you're gone and you won't come back\r\nMaybe a little space or a little time\r\nSomewhere far from here will get you off my mind\n\nI can't stay watching you move on all February long\n\n\n\nI'm going to Michigan for the winter\n\nBetween the dark and the light of the sky and the snow\n\nMost people go south for the weather\n\nInstead of hiding out in the cold, but\n\n\n\nJust in case you wanna change your mind\n\nI'm lettin' you know where you can find me\n\n46th Street, that first right turn\n\nDown a dirt road watching that wood stove burn\n\nI'm either waiting out your memory\n\nOr for you don't wanna come back to me\n\nWhichever comes first until it don't hurt no more\n\nI'll be up North\n\nI'm going to Michigan for the winter\n\nI'm going to Michigan\n\n\n\nThis seven-hour long empty rear-view drive\n\nIsn't what I want, but I guess it's time\n\nTo say goodbye to the way things were\n\nI've finally come to terms, but\n\n\n\nJust in case you wanna change your mind\n\nI'm lettin' you know where you can find me\n\n46th Street, that first right turn\n\nDown a dirt road watching that wood stove burn\n\nI'm either waiting out your memory\n\nOr for you don't wanna come back to me\n\nWhichever comes first until it don't hurt no more\n\nI'll be up North\n\nI'm going to Michigan for the winter\n\nOoh, yeah\n\n\n\nI'm going to Michigan for the winter\n\n'Tween the dark and the light of the sky and the snow\n\nMost people go south for the weather\n\nBut I just wanna be alone\n\n\n\nJust in case you wanna change your mind\n\nI'm lettin' you know where you can find me\n\n46th Street, that first right turn\n\nDown a dirt road watching that wood stove burn\n\nWhile I'm waiting out your memory\n\nGirl, the only place that I'm supposed to be\n\nIs sittin' in a chair with a Bible or a beer\n\n'Til my heart don't hurt no more\n\nI'm going to Michigan for the winter\n\nYeah, I'm going to Michigan for the winter"
