  "lyrics": "In a dark and lonely corner, all the time in Dark-side inn\r\nSits a local barstool warrior, talking to his gin\r\nTreating past decisions, he motions for a shot\r\nIs he doomed to be a man this world forgot?\r\nJust a prisoner of the monster on his back\n\n\n\nCall it bad luck, call it fate\n\nCall it stuck here the rest of my days\n\nServes me right, what went wrong\n\nAnd where do I belong?\n\n\n\nIn the glow of flashing lights, on the shoulder of the road\n\nClutching at the bruised and tired skin\n\nShe tries to signal danger with anguish in her eyes\n\nWill he see the world of pain she's in?\n\n\n\nOr is it too late?\n\n\n\nWas it bad luck, was it fate\n\nOr a past that she couldn't escape?\n\nIt's not right, something's wrong\n\nJust where do I belong?\n\n\n\nPromises made, crying in vain\n\nAll empty, never accepting the blame\n\nAnd not letting go of the shame\n\nA river of tears, as months turned to years\n\nAll wasted on someone not willing to change\n\nNow only a shadow remains\n\n\n\nNo one can save you\n\nAnd there's no one to see\n\nIt has been written\n\nYou will become all you think, all you feel, all you dream\n\n\n\nNow I'm cutting the anchor away\n\nAnd I won't look back\n\nI'm starting a new life today\n\nNow I see where I belong"
