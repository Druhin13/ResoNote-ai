  "lyrics": "So you can call till your voice is running out\r\nBut I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\r\nI'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down\r\nSo I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\r\nYeah, yeah\n\nRun, running back, tell 'em where I'm coming at\n\nI was on that bullshit, and now I'm done with that\n\nScared of what I didn't want, scared of what I wanted at\n\nThought that I was finished, but I hardly had begun in fact\n\nI'ma beast, I'ma monster, a savage\n\nAnd any other metaphor, the culture can imagine\n\nAnd I gotta caption for anybody asking\n\nThat is \"I'm feeling fucking fantastic\"\n\n\n\nSome days it doesn't take much to bring me down\n\nSome days I'm struggling for control\n\nSome days it doesn't take much to bring me down\n\nBut right now I'm floating above it all\n\n\n\nSo you can call till your voice is running out\n\nBut I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\nI'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down\n\nSo I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah\n\nCome, come again, feeling when it's flooding in\n\nWoke up knowing I don't have to be numb again\n\nStarting line, scratch that, I don't have to run again\n\nGiving fucks back, tell 'em that I'm not coming in\n\nI'm the person on the payroll\n\nAnd you can't tell me how I should do it, 'cause you say so\n\nBut I'm not dancing to the rhythm, you replay no\n\n'Cause I'm already half a million miles away no\n\n\n\nSome days it doesn't take much to bring me down\n\nSome days I'm struggling for control\n\nSome days it doesn't take much to bring me down\n\nBut right now I'm floating above it all\n\n\n\nSo you can call till your voice is running out\n\nBut I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\nI'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down\n\nSo I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\n\n\nAnd I waited too long\n\nI listened too much\n\nYou said what can't be unheard\n\nI'm drawing a line\n\nEnough is enough\n\nI let you have your last words\n\n\n\nSo you can call till your voice is running out\n\nBut I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\nI'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down\n\nSo I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\n\n\nSo you can call till your voice is running out\n\nBut I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now\n\nI'm somewhere far away, where you can't bring me down\n\nSo I can't hear you now, I can't hear you now"
