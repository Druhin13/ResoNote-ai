  "lyrics": "Momma cuts like a man-of-war\r\nThrough the fog of an early morning\r\nWith nothing more than a coffee filling up her sails\r\nA couple sips and she says, I know\r\nI can keep what I started going\n\nShe hears the clock tick, the wolf who loiters at the door\n\nDaddy asleep in the bed he made the night before\n\nAnd so she cuts through the morning like a man-of-war\n\n\n\nDaddy burns like a meteor\n\nThrough a night of his own diversions\n\nHoping to blaze half a second of a glowing trail\n\n\n\nPours rum on his weary heart\n\nSays, hey, I'm closer than when I started\n\nHe hears the clock tick, the wolf who loiters at the door\n\nMomma tossing and turning through the coming storm\n\nAnd so he burns through diversions like a meteor\n\nOh, there's a lot to learn\n\n\n\nOne puts into port\n\nLowers a rowboat and grabs an oar\n\nSinging, all ashore that's going ashore\n\nOne falls back to earth\n\nLeaves a crater on the bedroom floor\n\nSinging, love, I know I promised more than this\n\n\n\nMomma cuts through the morning like a man-of-war\n\nDaddy burns through diversions like a meteor\n\nAnd so they use another like a guiding star\n\nAnd how I watch as they wonder where and what they are\n\n\n\nI reflect like a troubadour\n\nThe ebb and flow of their hope and worry\n\nIn every verse of living, breathing fairy tale\n\n\n\nAs Momma rises and Daddy sets\n\nJust like they have since the night I met them\n\nI hear the clock tick, the wolf who loiters at the door\n\nAnd whatever else they decide to fight about and for\n\nAs I reflect, hope, and worry like a troubadour\n\nOh, there's a lot to learn\n\n\n\nOne puts into port\n\nLowers a rowboat and grabs an oar\n\nSinging, all ashore that's going ashore\n\nOne falls back to earth\n\nLeaves a crater on the bedroom floor\n\nSinging, love, I don't need any more than this"
