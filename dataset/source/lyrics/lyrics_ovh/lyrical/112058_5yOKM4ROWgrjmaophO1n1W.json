  "lyrics": "L-O-X shit, nigga\r\nTrinity\r\nAye... ha!\r\nWhatchu think we do this shit for? Nigga, we was piss poor\r\nCoke on the fifth floor, fourth and the third and the second and the first and the sixth\n\nOutside from the first to the sixth\n\nFlippin' on a brick that I got from a Spanish nigga\n\nStandin' with the cannon just ready to blam a nigga\n\nSkippin' on a court 'cause the judge'll remand a nigga\n\nNiggas say it's love but I know they can't stand a nigga, yeah\n\nI'm familiar with the life, I got the fuck out 'cause I'm familiar with the night\n\nAnd a knife and the ice and a car that is high priced\n\nGettin' knocked from the cops and spendin' the yard twice\n\nThousand push-ups a night, hittin' the bar twice\n\nReminiscing over pussy and money and bar fights\n\nMe? I hit the X and get hit in the hard right\n\n'Bout to blend in with the stars, nigga, I'm alright\n\nHalf sun, half moon, my nigga, I'm all bright\n\nIf you fuck with The Lox, you know that it's on site\n\nMaster of the goon talk, yet there still a wizard barefoot in a blizzard\n\nI could fuck around and moonwalk, hustle\n\nI could talk through a fork, knock a spoon off\n\nMade penny enough, nigga, I knock June off\n\nIt's the Phantom, call me an entity\n\nSoul is real, old, my nigga, couple of centuries\n\n\n\nSee these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm\n\nY'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long\n\nYou don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on\n\nYou could try to back but my niggas too strong\n\nI'm just tryna get a way out from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block\n\nI'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock\n\nSo I load my gun\n\n\n\nMy vest on, I brought two hammers, it ain't no goon with me\n\nBury you in your Yeezys have Kanye read the eulogy\n\nYou owe me but I know you broke, I'll settle for your jewelry\n\nEven if it's fake, we might could sell it out the state\n\nLoud mouth nigga, I don't thnk you could yell without your face startin' fire\n\nSnitchin', these niggas is tellin' out the gate\n\nTransport, I know I could still send a bell without a trace\n\nFifty percent jealously and the other half is hate\n\nFuck the status, niggas angry 'cause they average and I'm great\n\nStab 'em with the same knife I use to cut my steaks\n\nSay my grace before I treat a nigga face like my plate\n\nEarly at this guap, y'all niggas in a race to be late\n\nSwitch side when they hate you, probably mention me too\n\nI had the molly when Pharrell was sayin' Mr. Me Too\n\nWaited in lines on 55th just to see Skip To My Lou\n\nThe bigger [?] had me sippin' on crew, gimmie the loot\n\n\n\nSee these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm\n\nY'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long\n\nYou don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on\n\nYou could try to back but my niggas too strong\n\nI'm just tryna get a way out from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block\n\nI'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock\n\nSo I load my gun\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nWhy you think we still doin' it?\n\nThe dream is still alive, my nigga, and we're pursuing it\n\nThe money on your head is expired, then we're renewin' it\n\nThe plan is not for you to ruin it\n\nThe next time I look at your body, I think of viewin' it\n\nAin't even got enough sense to put two in it\n\nKnow my like my backwoods stuffed with Guerilla Glue in it\n\nThe hood is like the jungle with a sprinkler, the zoo in it, yeah\n\nFrom the block to the interstate\n\nGet a couple dollars, watch all of the love disentegrate\n\nBad enough a nigga gotta deal with the inner hate\n\nOn 95 south, I'm just tryna get a dinner plate\n\nOne false move, I'm comin' back in a bag\n\nPrices is right though, I'm comin' back in a Jag\n\nRaised it to your cheek, you comin' back with a scab\n\nLotta thoughts in my mind, I'm runnin' back to the lab\n\nAudibles be the best plays, I still got a line on the best haze\n\nI get it from the eses\n\nI'm light years ahead of these niggas, I mean decades\n\n\n\nSee these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm\n\nY'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long\n\nYou don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on\n\nYou could try to back but my niggas too strong\n\nI'm just tryna get a way out from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block\n\nI'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock\n\nSo I load my gun\n\n\n\nYeah, what'chu think I do this shit for?\n\nDope money, rap money, dollar on a pick four\n\nQuick draw, gun on me, late night, quick score\n\nNetflix, nah homie, big movie, Pixar\n\nHood love, born and raised, first unit, fifth floor\n\nBeen cool but like that, silverback, jigsaw\n\nTalk less, pay attention, pull-up bar, heavy benchin'\n\nSheek did a lotta bitches, hatin' niggas, lotta tension\n\nShoot, shoot for real, for real\n\nMines go from jail to jail\n\nLawyers got bail to bail\n\nYours can't keep it real\n\nWe not close, we used to be\n\nThis the new me, get used to me\n\nI changed for the better, dawg, truthfully\n\nInspiration for your kid on what you could be\n\nWhat you see is what you get, no scrutiny\n\nInstead you wanna follow him, I'm like, 'who is he?'\n\n[?] wanna get a way out from the yayo\n\nNo Instagram, I-G, or cable\n\nJust some liquor and some good smoke\n\nAnd some good smoke\n\nAnd some good smoke\n\n\n\nSee these niggas act stupid when the weather get warm\n\nY'all been lettin' these fuck niggas slide too long\n\nYou don't wanna get clapped, I suggest you move on\n\nYou could try to back but my niggas too strong\n\nI'm just tryna get a way out from the yayo and the hatin' niggas on my block\n\nI'm just tryna avoid the police, see a mill' piece but these niggas won't let me rock\n\nSo I load my gun"
