  "lyrics": "Within this cold you reside\r\nThe gathering snow\r\nTo have traveled so far\r\nWith nothing to show\r\nSo far from the warmth of the sun\n\nSo far back where I've begun\n\n\n\nI can no longer run\n\nI no longer wish to hide\n\nSeasons of falter\n\nAnd the tears that shall be cried\n\n\n\nThe [?] that rides\n\nThat carries your name\n\nThe people gather and mourn\n\nIn the cold winter's rain\n\n\n\nSo far from the warmth of the sun\n\nSo far back where I've begun\n\n\n\nI can no longer run\n\nI no longer wish to hide\n\nSeasons of falter\n\nAnd the tears that shall be cried\n\n\n\nSo far from the warmth of the sun\n\nSo far back where I've begun\n\n\n\nI can no longer run\n\nI no longer wish to hide\n\nSeasons of falter\n\nAnd the tears that shall be cried"
