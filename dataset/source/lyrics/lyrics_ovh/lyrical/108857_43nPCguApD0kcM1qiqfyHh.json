  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Palo Santo par Years & Years\r\n(You're the darkness in me)\n\nI'm weighting spirits tonight\nAnd I can't hear your voice\nI've got nothing to hide\n'Cause you're with another boy\nAnd I'm carving the sky\nI'm having visions manifesting us in time\n\nSo I arrive from the coast\nI've got three more days\nI know you want me the most\nWant me in an altered state\nI've been sleeping with ghosts\nAnd I swallow medication\nYou should know\n\n\nStrike a match and whisper my name\n(Burning, burning )\nSpeak in tongues then [?] wait 'til I break\n(Burning, burning)\n\nAnd I'm giving in to a fever touch\nThen it all begin when the fire starts\nYou're the darkness in me\nPalo Santo\n\nAnd the memories will fill up with smoke\nAnd [?] remember me and I start to choke\nYou're the darkness in me\nPalo Santo\n\nYou're, you're the darkness\nYou're, you're the darkness\n\nYou're darkness in me\nPalo Santo\n\nYou're, you're the darkness. (You are, you are)\nYou're, you're the darkness. (You are)\nYou're darkness in me\nPalo Santo"
