  "lyrics": "If you had a second chance in life, what would you do?\r\nWould you put the pills down? Throw out the lean too?\r\nTreat you baby mama right and make way for your kids\r\nPeace with your enemies, keep the water under the bridge\r\nI think 'bout if my motorcycle crash was fatal\r\nBroken bones, internal bleedin', stressed on the table going through surgery\n\nTwo machines helpin' me breath sorry mama I wanna stay but I gotta leave\n\nI see my funeral pat I see some lyin', some cryin' and some givin' dap\n\nI see false claimers, strangers and foes with their head in their laps I see more division I see some of them showing up just to post a picture like they was my nigga\n\nInstagram's a dead man's best friend\n\nEverybody lookin' for likes but wasn't likin' you in\n\nYou needed somethin' to hold on dealin' with life stress\n\nGlad them angels came in surgery said \"I'm not done yet\"\n\n\n\nI know saints, I know sinners, I know bastards\n\nI know pain, I know wins, I know losses\n\nMy loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me\n\nMy loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me\n\nI came to redeem myself, all I need is God's help\n\nThere's a millions of miracles so made the real you, the real truth\n\n\n\nIf I had a second chance in life this what I'd do\n\nI buy you flowers talk to you for hours get your truth\n\nI listen to you when you're hurt I should've went to church with you\n\nBut my credentials didn't work I still should've work with you\n\nI should've left them lil' hoes alone and came home\n\nBut I blamed the moments on you though I was in the wrong\n\nYou checked my phone and I checked you 'bout it\n\nWe never talked it over instead we just sexted 'bout it\n\nI said, \"I'm comin' over\" you turned up flexed 'bout it\n\nI hit yo mama phone she said \"y'all get it together\" she don't know what we on\n\nMy response was whatever I'm ego trippin' hotever\n\nI hate to see you goin' she gave me that dial tone\n\nI should've gave you more trust, more love, no lies, more us\n\n'cause when my motorcycle crash and everyone left\n\nYou was that angel in surgery sayin' \"I ain't done yet\"\n\nReal shit\n\n\n\nI know saints, I know sinners, I know bastards\n\nI know pain, I know wins, I know losses\n\nMy loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me\n\nMy loyalty's sensitive so please don't cross me\n\nI came to redeem myself all I need is God's help\n\nThere's a millions of miracles so made the real you, the real truth"
