  "lyrics": "I found myself in a new city\r\nI met you again fortuitously\r\nAnd you quickly put yourself into my sights\r\nI fell so hard my friends swore I was blind\r\nAnd now I'm lovesick and sunburned\r\nAnd summer's only beginning\n\n\n\nI've done many foolish and hurtful things\n\nTwisting myself up into the sheets with guilt\n\nAnd I've let loads of men into my life\n\nWho smothered me with jealousy and pride\n\nBut you seem so cool\n\nAnd I'll bet you do make me feel like a lady\n\nI wish you would hold me in your arms\n\nLike the night we made out on Belle Isle\n\nI know there won't always be fireworks\n\nBut we saw them that night for a while\n\n\n\nI know that I'm very new in town\n\nAnd I'm so scared my past will run me down for good\n\nBut when I see you looking back at me\n\nI think you see the girl I wanna be\n\nAnd for now this bitter earth is suddenly worth all the trouble\n\nWe danced to that song twice in a row and I can't let go all that easy"
