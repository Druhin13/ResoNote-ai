  "lyrics": "Can't believe I was so naive about it\r\nA little too trusting, never even doubted\r\nLookin' back now, figurin' out\r\nI was the last one to know in the whole damn town\r\nI can't believe I was so naive about it\n\nEvery nightmare and every dream\n\nI'm gonna make sure that you see\n\nExactly what you did to me\n\nIt'll feel just like a curse\n\nIt'll knock you in the dirt\n\nAnd just when you think it can't get worse\n\nI'm gonna hit you where it hurts\n\n\n\nI'm gonna stand my ground, I won't bow down to you\n\nI ain't leavin' town after all the hell I've been through\n\nI can move on and find another\n\nBut you're the one that needs to suffer\n\nStand my ground, I won't bow down to you\n\n\n\nEvery nightmare and every dream\n\nI'm gonna make sure that you see\n\nExactly what you did to me\n\nIt'll feel just like a curse\n\nIt'll knock you in the dirt\n\nAnd just when you think it can't get worse\n\nI'm gonna hit you where it hurts\n\nI'm gonna hit you where it hurts\n\nI'm gonna hit you where it hurts\n\n\n\nEvery nightmare and every dream\n\nI'm gonna make sure that you see\n\nExactly what you did to me\n\nIt'll feel just like a curse\n\nIt'll knock you in the dirt\n\nAnd just when you think it can't get worse\n\nI'm gonna hit you where it hurts\n\nI'm gonna hit you where it hurts"
