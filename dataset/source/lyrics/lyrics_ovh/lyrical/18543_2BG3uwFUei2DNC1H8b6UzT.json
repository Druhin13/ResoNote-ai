  "lyrics": "I got some blood under my nails, I got some mud on my face\r\nMy voice is shot I'm going grey, These muscles all ache\r\nDon't cry for me, I'm the life of the party\r\nI'm smiling most of the time\r\nI may be gritting my teeth, can't get back where we started\n\nThese days I'm doing just fine\n\n\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nI won't pound my chest or criticize\n\nI must confess, I've lived, I've died\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\n\n\nI knew every buried body paid for each head stone\n\nI may have led the prayers in public but I cried alone\n\n\n\nFound God through sin but this ain't my confession\n\nI'll wait on judgement day\n\nIt's lose or win, God no need for protection\n\nStand up or out of my way\n\n\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nI won't pound my chest or criticize\n\nI must confess, I've lived, I've died\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\n\n\nI wound pound my chest\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nGod bless this mess, this bless is mine\n\n\n\nThe howling dooms day dogs\n\nAre snapping at your feet\n\nRound here the sky is cracked\n\nBut won't admit defeat\n\nDown here there they got your back\n\nAnd good men stood at your side\n\nThis treasure chest of rags\n\nStill keeps this dream alive\n\n\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nI won't pound my chest or criticize\n\nI must confess, I've lived, I've died\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\n\n\nI won't pound\n\nGod bless this mess, this mess is mine\n\nGod bless this mess, this bless is mine"
