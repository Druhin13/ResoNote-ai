  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Spacewoman par The Breeders\r\nSpacewoman, spacewoman\nHow lonely does it feel?\nYou're spinning round and round\nI look up\nI'm down here, rolling around too\n\nI look up\nLook up\nLook up\n\nThere's a beachball in the stadium\nPlaying baseball out there, havin' fun\nHitting home runs and line drives\nWith the sun in their eyes\n\nI look up\n\nLook up\nI'm lonely too\n\nI watch you disappear\nYou have no gravity\nHow long?\n\nWhen you look out at your big light show\nDo you ever wanna turn around and go?\nHitting every green light on the long way home\n\nWe got a beachball in the stadium\nEverybody's havin' fun\nWhen you close your eyes\nYou spin in peace\n\nSpacewoman, spacewoman\nHow lonely does it feel?\n\n\nI look up\nLook up\nLook up\n\nThere's a beachball in the stadium\nPlaying baseball out there, havin' fun\nHitting home runs and line drives\nWith the sun in your eyes\n\nSee all the oceans\nHear us on the radio\nDo you ever wanna turn around and go\nYou're hitting every green light on the long way home"
