  "lyrics": "Incomplete without tearing up all of the sleeves\r\nNobody cares\r\n\"You look fine\", no I don’t, let’s consult our favorite recipe\r\nNobody cares\r\nOh no, nobody cares\n\nOut we go into the world of scary eyes and lies\n\nLow key baby, I’m never feeling quite alright\n\nNobody cares\n\nOh no, nobody cares\n\nOh no, nobody cares\n\n\n\nHow am I to care, how am I to care\n\nHow am I to care when nobody else does\n\n\n\nSweet relief when you grow up and see for yourself\n\nNobody cares\n\nHave a drink, have a smoke, do whatever you need to unload\n\nNobody cares\n\nOh no, nobody cares\n\n\n\nRecord skip, tripping over, falling up the stairs\n\nAwkward kids putting gel into their greasy hair\n\nNobody cares\n\nOh no, nobody cares\n\nOh no, nobody cares\n\n\n\nHow am I to care, how am I to care\n\nHow am I to care when nobody else does"
