  "lyrics": "Well, the moon sank as the wind blew\r\nAnd the street lights slowly died\r\nYeah they call you the wild one\r\nSaid stay away from her\r\nSaid she couldn't love no one if she tried\n\nBut then somethin' I saw in your eyes\n\nTold me right away\n\nThat you were gonna have to be mine\n\nThe strangest feeling came over me down inside\n\nNo matter what it takes\n\nI'll never get over how good it felt\n\nWhen you finally held me\n\nI will never regret baby\n\nThose few hours linger on in my head forever\n\n\n\nWell it's too bad but I want you\n\nTo know I understand\n\nYeah it's been a long time\n\nBut I don't mind, yeah it's all right\n\nI understand\n\n\n\nBecause somethin' I saw in your eyes\n\nTold me right away\n\nThat you were gonna have to be mine\n\nThe strangest feeling came over me down inside\n\nI knew right away\n\nI'd never get over how good it felt\n\nWhen you finally kissed me\n\nI will never regret baby\n\nBaby, those few hours linger on in my head forever"
