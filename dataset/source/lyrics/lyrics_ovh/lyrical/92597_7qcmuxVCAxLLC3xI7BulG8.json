  "lyrics": "Light on the street, keep me blind\r\nSand on my feet, you're running me out of town\r\nOut of my mind\r\nThousands of leaves, they bury me under her eyes\r\nMild breeze is telling me it's not my time\r\nShe's not mine\n\n\n\nSo day by day, I'll turn my dreams\n\nInto a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love\n\nDay by day, I'll turn my dreams\n\nInto a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love\n\n\n\nI'm lost in the sea of sweet design\n\nSmoke that I breathe awakens me and she's divine\n\nBut she's not mine\n\n\n\nSo day by day, I'll turn my dreams\n\nInto a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love\n\nDay by day, I'll turn my dreams\n\nInto a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love\n\n\n\nHeaven up above, may lift my thoughts of you\n\nHand that touched the earth\n\nMake me lovely and touch me, too\n\nMake me crystal pure, cast my heart anew\n\n\n\nSo day by day, I'll turn my dreams\n\nInto a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love\n\nDay by day, I'll turn my dreams\n\nInto a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love"
