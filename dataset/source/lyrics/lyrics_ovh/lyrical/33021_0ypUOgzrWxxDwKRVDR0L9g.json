  "lyrics": "Sometimes there's no one listening\r\nSometimes there's nothing happening\r\nI seek a needle in the night\r\nI feel my body in the way\r\nI put some fingers in the mud\r\nI put my back into the work\n\nI face the wall\n\nI kiss the ground\n\nI try to move it\n\nI try to settle down\n\nI kiss the ground\n\n\n\nNo one can save like I do\n\nNo one can sing like I do\n\nAnd when I feel it coming on\n\nI throw my body in the wave\n\nI want to touch it for myself\n\nI see an image in the air\n\nI kiss the crown\n\nI kiss the ground\n\nI see an opening\n\n\n\nNo one can see like I do\n\nNo one can see it like I do\n\nI find a needle in the night\n\nI'm at the bottom of the lake\n\nI'm coming up again\n\nI'm throwing everything away\n\nI kiss the ground\n\nRelay, relay runner"
