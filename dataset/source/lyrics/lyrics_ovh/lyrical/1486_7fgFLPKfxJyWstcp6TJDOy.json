  "lyrics": "When times get tough\r\nIn a world gone cold\r\nFeels like we're all alone\r\nLife is just a roller coaster\r\nCan't feel my hands\r\nGot no plans\n\nAnd I just can't wait until it's over\n\n\n\nWhen I've had enough\n\nWhen I've had enough\n\n\n\nThat's when I feel your sun\n\nShining down on me\n\nAnd it's early days yet\n\nAs long I am free\n\nI feel your sun\n\nThat's where I wanna be\n\nSoakin up your light\n\nAnd your energy\n\nRight next to me\n\nMeans the world to me\n\nYour energy\n\n\n\nLife can take you low make you wanna just run & hide\n\nDarkness can numb the hurt and the pain that you feel inside\n\nLights gone out\n\nFueled by doubt\n\nAnd your holding on but barely alive"
