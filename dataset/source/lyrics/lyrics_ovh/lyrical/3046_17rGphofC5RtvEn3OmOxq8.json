Then really, you pressed your luck\n\nThe problem is you didn't recognize I give no clucks\n\nSo wrap it up, turn these chickens to rubber ducks\n\nAnd BK, don't think that you got away\n\nYou copied my old menu and put it out on replay\n\nThey bring it back like rebates, fresh food on your dinner plate\n\nYou killin' me smalls, okay? Uh, I'ma say it again\n\nDon't play with me, it ain't safe, can't always have it yo way\n\nSo give it up like today and we won't have this again\n\n\n\nWendy's been holdin' it down for like a minute now\n\nMickey *Bleep*, you need to stop it, boy, you finished now\n\nThe team can handle any problem, that's all principal\n\nYou get it now, chicken shack, you actin' really wild\n\nQuiet that down, Wendy's leave them all without a sound\n\nThis ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles, yeah, hah\n\nThis ain't no cakewalk, we run the town for many miles"
