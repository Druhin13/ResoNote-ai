  "lyrics": "I should've seen this through\r\nBut I knew how it could end\r\nI guess things don't change\r\nI let feelings fade again\r\nAnd I won't let go\n\nWhat I called home unless\n\nIt slipped right through my fingers in the rain\n\nBut I've thrown it all\n\nOver waterfalls\n\n\n\nI'm staring at the clouds\n\nYou know I hate this weather\n\nBut we can work it out\n\nI swear I could do better\n\nIf you let me\n\nSo we wait for things to change\n\nI never thought that this could end\n\nIf I'm not with you\n\nHow could I fall asleep again\n\n\n\nWhat's wrong with the lights low\n\nJust tell me what it is you're tryna say\n\n'Cause, in the end, you'll understand\n\nI'm already a world away\n\nAnd I see you haven't changed\n\n\n\n'Cause this shit gets old\n\nWith a heart of gold, you know\n\nIf I need you, I'll see you in my dreams\n\nBut I've thrown it all\n\nOver waterfalls\n\n\n\nI'm staring at the clouds\n\nYou know I hate this weather\n\nBut we can work it out\n\nI swear I could do better\n\nIf you let me\n\nSo we wait for things to change\n\nI never thought that this could end\n\nIf I'm not with you\n\nHow could I fall asleep again?\n\n\n\nYou know that I've been here times before\n\nAnd no one's watching\n\nYou won't ever know, that's right\n\nYou won't ever save my life\n\nYou won't ever change my mind"
