What's the reason that you whine?\n\nWhat's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine\n\nSo sour, in this light of lime\n\nDaddy said \"study hard or get that cash\"\n\nMommy said \"your career ain't gon' last\"\n\nLoose change, call a cab, move out their pad\n\nI just want a chance to move past my past\n\nDon't think too fast, private jets still crash\n\nAnd I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach\n\nAnd I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at\n\nTouch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man\n\n(Somebody gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)\n\n\n\nAnd I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to\n\n(How I used to)\n\n(I don't matter)\n\nAnd I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to\n\n(How I used to, how)\n\n(I don't matter)\n\n\n\nHow I, how I, how I, how I\n\nHow I used to, how I used to\n\nHow I used to"
