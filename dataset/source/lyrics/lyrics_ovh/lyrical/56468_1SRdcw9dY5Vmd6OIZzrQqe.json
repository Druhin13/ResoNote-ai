  "lyrics": "Usually a drink will do the trick\r\nTake the edge off quick, sitting in the dark\r\nWith a shared cigarette\r\nSeeing eye-to-eye, and heart-to-heart\r\nBut maybe I'm just getting old\r\nUsed to work but now it don't\n\n\n\nA long gone drive\n\nYou know the kind where you take a turn\n\nAnd you don't know why\n\nBut it clears your mind, a surefire cure\n\nI need something stronger\n\nThat'll last a little longer\n\n\n\nI could use a love song\n\nThat takes me back, just like that\n\nWhen it comes on\n\nTo a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes\n\nAt a guy and a girl\n\nWho make it work in a world\n\nThat for me so far just seems to go so wrong\n\nYeah I could use, I could use a love song\n\n\n\nI wish I didn't know so much\n\nI peeked behind the curtain\n\nNow the magic rush\n\nFeels like a trick that isn't working\n\nBut I haven't lost all hope yet\n\nYeah it's hurting but it ain't dead\n\n\n\nI could use a love song\n\nThat takes me back, just like that\n\nWhen it comes on\n\nTo a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes\n\nAt a guy and a girl\n\nWho make it work in a world\n\nThat for me so far just seems to go so wrong\n\nYeah I could use, I could use a love song\n\n\n\nGive me a sign or a rhyme or a reason\n\nJust something that I can believe in\n\n\n\nI could use a love song\n\nThat takes me back, just like that\n\nWhen it comes on\n\nTo a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes\n\nAt a guy and a girl\n\nWho make it work in a world\n\nThat for me so far just seems to go so wrong\n\nYeah I could use\n\nYeah I could use, I could use a love song"
