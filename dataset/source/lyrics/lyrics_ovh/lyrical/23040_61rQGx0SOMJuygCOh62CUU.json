  "lyrics": "I'm the beast of the boardwalk\r\nHair teased up, I'm torn up\r\nI'm gonna think myself silly til I'm not silly anymore\r\nI'm gonna make myself silly til I'm not really anymore\r\nAnd I think I'm gonna be okay\r\nAnd I'll be queen for a day\n\n\n\nQueen for a day\n\n\n\nTomorrow will be trounce\n\nI'm talking trippy on a wave length (Trippy on a wavelength)\n\nThe sun will be bouncy (Oh so bouncy)\n\nToday will be past tense\n\nAnd I can make it to tomorrow if I make this show\n\nI can make it all show, be vulnerable\n\nI'm gonna win up all their sorry, be the one to get the gold\n\nI'll be queen for a day\n\n\n\nQueen For A Day\n\n\n\nWhen space invades there will come my turn\n\nOnce pigs fly past the moon\n\nBut tonight I've tuned out you\n\nYeah, tonight eclipsed your mood\n\n\n\nQueen For A Day\n\nGod, I need this"
