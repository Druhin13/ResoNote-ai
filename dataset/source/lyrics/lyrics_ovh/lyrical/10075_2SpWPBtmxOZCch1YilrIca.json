  "lyrics": "They will make mistakes with us\r\nConfuse the audience with their work\r\nAnd hold their hand up to the light\r\nTo see how much a life feels worth\r\nYou believe it's chemical\n\nThe product of some random nears\n\nBut I fear they're not so cheating death\n\nThe truth it hangs above our heads\n\nThe exit day\n\n\n\nAh oh ah ah ah\n\nYou of all people\n\nAh oh ah ah ah\n\nYou of all people\n\n\n\nI get the feeling to look up\n\nAt something larger than myself\n\nAnd reach for what is not allowed\n\nNo matter how I love the ground\n\n\n\nNo matter how you glom the dirt\n\nYou fight against your own two hands\n\nYou feel the fingers down your spine\n\nMistake the passion for the crime\n\nEvery time\n\n\n\nAh oh ah ah ah\n\nYou of all people\n\nAh oh ah ah ah\n\nYou of all people\n\n\n\nAh oh ah ah ah\n\nYou of all people\n\nAh oh ah ah ah\n\nYou of all people"
