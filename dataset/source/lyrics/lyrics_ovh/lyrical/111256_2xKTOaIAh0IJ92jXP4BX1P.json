Once you level up\n\nDon't you know the boss is bigger, yeah\n\nUsed to spend a lot of time daring myself\n\nThen spent a lot of time comparing myself\n\nTurn into the doubt, then the fear in myself\n\nOverthinking to the point I was imparin' myself\n\nNow I know my Chappelle went missing\n\nNow I know why Brit got the clippers\n\nNow I know why Ye started trippin\n\nThe pressure and the expectation get ya, ah\n\n\n\nOh well if they don't like it\n\nI might turn up by myself\n\nI don't need opinions\n\nNo, I did this for myself (for myself, aye)\n\n\n\nDeath to my depression and anxiety\n\nDeath to all my stress and what I'm trying to be\n\nI'ma get live, 'cause I'm still alive\n\nAnd if I die, ain't no way I'm giving up now\n\n\n\nI ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done\n\nAs long as there's breath in my lungs\n\nI ain't done, I ain't done, I ain't done\n\nAs long as there's breath in my lungs, I ain't done\n\n\n\nI know you feel like you can't change\n\nI know you think it'll always be the same\n\nI want to be full of potential again\n\nBut I ain't done"
