Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\n\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you\n\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\n\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you\n\n\n\nNow my life is on the line\n\nAnd my stranger fi di crimes, yeah, yeah\n\nIf you ready for the ride\n\nJust know it's cold like bag of ice\n\n\n\nNever said it was easy, never know what to do\n\nOh, when these walls fall down, I'll stand by you\n\nWhat you believe in, I'll give it to you\n\n'Cause when these walls fall down, I'll stand by you\n\n\n\nOh, oh (Stand by me, Stand by me)\n\nOh, ah-oh (Oh, I like it)\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nOh-oh, ah-oh\n\nOh-oh, ah-oh\n\n\n\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\n\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you\n\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\n\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you"
