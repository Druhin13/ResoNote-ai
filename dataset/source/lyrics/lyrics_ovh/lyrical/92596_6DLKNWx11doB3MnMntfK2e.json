(Why have you come for me?)\n\n'Cause I was fine before you came to my door\n\nI never should've let you stay\n\n\n\nMother, can you help me?\n\nI've been locked up, can't escape it\n\nHave I done wrong? Am I guilty?\n\nWhy do I feel like, I'm suffocating?\n\nOh, what does he want from me?\n\nSaid, \"I don't know?\" but he won't leave\n\nSo I guess I got bad company?\n\n\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\n\n\nI've been lying in my bed, but I haven't slept a wink\n\nWhen I try to close my eyes, yeah, my mind, it just overthinks\n\n\n\nSo tell me what you want, tell me what you want\n\nIs this just fun for you? (Is this just fun for you?)\n\n'Cause I know that it's not, I know that it's not\n\nBecause I am you\n\n\n\nMother, can you help me?\n\nI've been locked up, can't escape it\n\nHave I done wrong? Am I guilty?\n\nWhy do I feel like, I'm suffocating?\n\nOh, what does he want from me?\n\nSaid, \"I don't know?\" but he won't leave\n\nSo I guess I got bad company?\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm trying to scream, it feels like a dream\n\nNo sound comes out, no one's to be seen\n\nBut I know I'm not alone\n\nYeah, I know I'm not alone\n\nAnd you talk to me with your violent tongue\n\nBut I won't react 'cause I'll look psycho\n\nThis can't keep going on\n\nNo, this can't keep going on\n\n\n\nMother, can you help me?\n\nI've been locked up, can't escape it\n\nHave I done wrong? Am I guilty?\n\nWhy do I feel like, I'm suffocating?\n\n\n\nMother, can you help me?\n\nI've been locked up, can't escape it\n\nHave I done wrong? Am I guilty?\n\nWhy do I feel like, I'm suffocating?\n\nOh, what does he want from me?\n\nSaid, \"I don't know?\" but he won't leave\n\nSo I guess I got bad company?\n\n\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\n(Got bad company)\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh-oh\n\nOh-woah-oh\n\n(Got bad company)\n\nOh-woah-oh"
