  "lyrics": "My friend I need a little help\r\nTo fend the darkness at the end\r\nOf all this, I thought that I had fought it\r\nBut like clockwork it seems to keep on coming\r\nOh dear, you saw me on a night when I was pissed\r\nAnd I tried to act alright, smooth talking\n\nI'm not sure you bought it\n\nSo I'm crawling to the nearest taxi\n\n\n\nSo, let it out\n\nI need a little something and I can't seem to get it\n\nNow, love, help me now\n\nI got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them out\n\n\n\nLet's pretend that we had never met\n\nSo then it's fair when we are getting it on Sunday\n\nI know that that's a fun day\n\nTo remember 'til I see you next, yeah\n\n\n\nSo, let it out\n\nI need a little something and I can't seem to get it\n\nNow, love, help me now\n\nI got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them out\n\n\n\nThis must be the memory\n\nWhere you took that photograph of me\n\nDon't act so embarrassed\n\nWe all do dumb thing's when we're lonely\n\nYou know my heart deeply\n\nBut we don't talk about that, do we?\n\nAnd hold your wife like a silence\n\n\n\nSo, let it out\n\nI need a little something and I can't seem to get it\n\nNow, love, help me now\n\nI got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them out\n\n\n\nSo, let it out\n\nI need a little something and I can't seem to get it\n\nNow, love, help me now\n\nI got a lot of questions and I can't seem to get them\n\nI can't seem to get them\n\nI can't seem to get them\n\nI can't seem to get them out"
