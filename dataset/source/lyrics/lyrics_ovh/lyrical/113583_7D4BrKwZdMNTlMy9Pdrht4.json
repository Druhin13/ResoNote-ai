  "lyrics": "I see the day that passes by\r\nI develop a new way to hate you\r\nIt slowly beckons a love inside\r\nNow I can barely even stand the sight of you\r\nWe keep pretending there's nothing wrong\r\nPlaying parts in the tragic comedy\n\nSoon we'll be singing a different song\n\nWhen we both face our harsh reality\n\n\n\nYeah, we'll draw battle lines\n\nFortify our defenses once again\n\nYeah, we'll look for any sign\n\nWe'll meet each other's eyes once again\n\n\n\nThey all will hear our battle cry\n\n(This venom)\n\nIt keeps repeating and it's making me realize\n\nWe're just not able to survive\n\n(This venom)\n\nThis venom's killing us and we won't make it out alive\n\n\n\nI'm used to feeling you're stalking me\n\nI lie awake for the next explosion\n\nWith every word always haunting me\n\nI'm never able to let my guard down\n\nI feel the tension begin to rise\n\nI'm tired of living the sick déjà vu again\n\nIf we're able to compromise\n\nThere's no hope of me getting through again\n\n\n\nYeah, we'll draw battle lines\n\nFortify our defenses once again\n\nYeah, we'll scream the same old lines\n\nWe'll meet each other's eyes and that is when\n\n\n\nThey all will hear our battle cry\n\n(This venom)\n\nIt keeps repeating and it's making me realize\n\nWe're just not able to survive\n\n(This venom)\n\nThis venom's killing us and we won't make it out alive\n\n\n\nThis venom\n\n\n\nThey all will hear our battle cry\n\n(This venom)\n\nIt keeps repeating and it's making me realize\n\nWe're just not able to survive\n\n(This venom)\n\nThis venom's killing us and we won't make it out alive\n\nNo, we won't make it out alive"
