  "lyrics": "Drown me in slow motion\r\nSteal the breath I'm holding, you can take it with your smile\r\nChase me in the darkness, kiss me like your heartless then run away and hide\r\n'Cause I'll follow you into the wild\r\nRoll me like the thunder, let me feel your hunger for me tonight\n\nWhen your heart is broken, I'll suck out all the poison with a viper bite\n\n\n\nAnd I'll follow you into the wild, into the wild\n\nAnd I'll follow you into the wild, into the wild\n\n\n\nI won't change you, I won't change you\n\nI won't change you, I won't change you\n\n\n\nI can be your landslide, you can be my fall line, let's jump and shake the earth\n\n\n\n'Cause I'll follow you into the wild, into the wild\n\nAnd I'll follow you into the wild, into the wild, into the wild, into the wild\n\nChange you, change you, into the wild"
