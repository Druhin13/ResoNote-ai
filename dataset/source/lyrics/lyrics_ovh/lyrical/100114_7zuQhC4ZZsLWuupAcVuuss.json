  "lyrics": "I can still shut down a party\r\nI can hang with anybody\r\nI can drink whiskey and red wine\r\nChampagne all night\r\nLittle Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine\n\nBut when I taste tequila, baby I still see ya\n\nCutting up the floor in a Serotta t-shirt\n\nThe same one you wore when we were\n\nSky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle\n\nSwearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya\n\nI remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\n\n\nI can kiss somebody brand new \n\nAnd not even think about you\n\nI can show up to the same bar\n\nHear the same songs in my car\n\nBaby, your memory it only hits me this hard\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila, baby I still see ya\n\nCutting up the floor in a Serotta t-shirt\n\nThe same one you wore when we were\n\nSky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle\n\nSwearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya\n\nI remember how bad I need ya, when I taste Tequila\n\nWhen I taste Tequila\n\n\n\nI ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinking\n\nHow I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila, baby I still see ya\n\nSerotta t-shirt, the same one you wore when we were\n\nSky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle\n\nSwearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya\n\nI remember how bad I need ya, when I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila"
