  "lyrics": "In a sentimental mood\r\nI can see the stars come through my room\r\nWhile your loving attitude\r\nIs like a flame that lights the gloom\r\nOn the wings of every kiss\r\nDrifts a melody so strange and sweet\n\nIn this sentimental bliss\n\nYou make my paradise complete\n\nRose petals seem to fall\n\nIt's all I could dream to call you mine\n\nMy heart's a lighter thing\n\nSince you made this night a thing divine\n\nIn a sentimental mood\n\nI'm within a world so heavenly\n\nFor I never dreamt that you'd be loving sentimental me"
