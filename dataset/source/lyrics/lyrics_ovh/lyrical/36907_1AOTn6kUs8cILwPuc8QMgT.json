  "lyrics": "I remember it was late one night\r\nin the middle of a dream\r\nwoke up in a pool of sweat\r\nthought I heard a scream\r\nRan over to the window sill\r\nstuck my head out for a peek\n\nDressed in black was a man I didn't recognise\n\nrunning down my back street\n\nMy heart skipped a beat\n\n\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out when he comes around\n\nDon't make a sound\n\n\n\nThe morning paper and the head-lines read: Danger to the queen\n\nBuckingham Palace better tighten things up\n\nThe son of a bitch is mean.\n\nVendors on the corner just doin' their job\n\nacting like nothing's new\n\nScotland Yard's still looking for him\n\nbut he doesn't leave a single clue\n\nWhat can they do?\n\n\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out when he comes around\n\nDon't make a sound\n\n\n\nWho's this man who fell out of the sky?\n\nWhat's he done and where's he live?\n\nHow can a man who's a criminal be a hero to the kids?\n\nThe old couple swear that the Riper's back\n\nthey say it's him all right.\n\nThe young girl says it's Jesus\n\nand he won't be back again tonight\n\nI wonder who's right?\n\n\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out when he comes around\n\nDon't make a sound\n\n\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out, there's a stranger in town\n\nYou better watch out when he comes around\n\nDon't make a sound"
