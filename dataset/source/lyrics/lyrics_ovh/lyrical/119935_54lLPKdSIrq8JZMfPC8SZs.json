  "lyrics": "Oh, there's a river that winds on forever\r\nI'm gonna see where it leads\r\nOh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted\r\nI'm gonna stand on the peak\r\nOut there's a land that time don't command\r\nWanna be the first to arrive\n\nNo time for pondering why I'm wandering\n\nOh, while we're both still alive\n\n\n\nTo the ends of the earth, would you follow me?\n\nThere's a world that was meant for our eyes to see\n\nTo the ends of the earth, would you follow me?\n\nIf you are, I'm the same, I give bash to thee\n\n\n\nOh, there's an island where all things are silent\n\nI'm gonna whistle a tune\n\nOh, there's a desert, the size can't be measured\n\nI'm gonna count all the dunes\n\nOut there's a world that calls for me, girl\n\nHeading out into the unknown\n\nWay-fair with strangers and all kind of danger\n\nPlease don't say I'm going alone\n\n\n\nTo the ends of the earth, would you follow me?\n\nThere's a world that was meant for our eyes to see\n\nTo the ends of the earth, would you follow me?\n\nIf you are, I'm the same, I give bash to thee\n\n\n\nI wasn't ready to die for you, baby\n\nDoesn't mean I'm ready to stay\n\nWhat good is living a life you've been given\n\nIf all you do is stand in one place?\n\nI'm on a river that winds on forever\n\nFollow till I get where I'm goin'\n\nMaybe I'm heading to die but I'm still gonna try\n\nI guess I'm going alone"
