  "lyrics": "Leave my suitcase by the car I'll bring it in in the mornin'\r\nStack my guitar case just inside the door\r\nPet the dog too tired to wag his tail\r\nCheck the mail and walk on down the hallway\r\nI've got to fix these old floor boards\r\nWash up at the sink, glance in the mirror\n\nWho is that man who ain't been here in three long weeks or maybe more?\n\n\n\nAll this gettin' off the road has got me ragged to the bone and coming home\n\nThere ain't no homecoming party\n\n\n\nPop a yellow pill, the kind for sleepin' through\n\nThe sound of wakin' children when the daylight starts to show\n\nAnd it's silent up the carpet stairs and peek into the nursery\n\nWhere the little ones are dreamin' sweet and low\n\nI can hear 'em cryin', \"Daddy where you been?\n\nAnd did you bring me back a present from a distant sunny shore?\"\n\n\n\nAll this gettin' off the road has got me ragged to the bone and coming home\n\nThere ain't no homecoming party\n\n\n\nOh it's 10,000 places and 20,000 faces\n\nAnd half a million miles I'm bound to row\n\nAnd I'm weary and wasted, and all that I can taste is\n\nOne lonesome tear on the tip of my tongue\n\nShe must've left the light on I'll just slip into the bed and let it burn\n\nAnd when our bodies touch I'l pull away and not disturb her\n\nEven though I long for love so much it hurts\n\nAnd maybe we won't argue in the mornin'\n\nWe'll be makin' love and just let that old calendar turn\n\n\n\nAll this gettin' off the road has got me ragged to the bone and coming home\n\nSure ain't no homecoming party"
