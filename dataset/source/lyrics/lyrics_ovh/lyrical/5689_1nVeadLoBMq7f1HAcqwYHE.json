  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Something New par Pennywise\r\nThe funny thing about history\nIt keeps repeating what we got wrong\nReligious wars to settling old scores\nAncient grudges we should have forgot\nWe all believe in our democracy\nBut the elections are bought by the rich\nThe establishment prefers the 1%\nIt's a fix that we just can't quit\n\nHow long will it take us to finally make something new?\nWhen will we wake up and finally stop getting screwed\nIt's hypocrisy, not democracy and we're all being used\nHow long will it take us to make, make something new?\n\n\nWe all have ideas but when the government steals\nCorruption wins out every time\nRacist bigotry in forms of policy\nAnd get the middle class to tow the line\nIt's time to make a democratic state\nAnd give everyone an equal chance\nPut an end to war and don't just bomb the poor\nIt's the only chance we really have\n\nHow long will it take us to finally make something new?\nWhen will we wake up and finally stop getting screwed\nIt's hypocrisy, not democracy and we're all being used\nHow long will it take us to make, make something new?\n\n\nI feel consensus coming on\nArmed with the truth then we can't go wrong\nThe [?] consumed by greed\nSo what's there left to do?\nHow long will it take us to make, make something new?\nSomething new?\nHow long will it take us to make, make something new?\nSomething new?\nMake something new?"
