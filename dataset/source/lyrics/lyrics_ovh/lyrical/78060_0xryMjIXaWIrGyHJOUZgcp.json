  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lines par Jayde\r\n\nStaring out my window\nI feel it on the tip of my tongue\nThese feelings too familiar\nMaybe I should stick to what I know\n\nAll the words you don't say\nI'm hearing anyway\nIt's written all on your face\nAnd I'm so tired of reading\n\nBetween the lines\nBetween the lines\nBetween the lines and I'm so tired of reading\n\nCrying at my window\n\nIt ripples through my bones\nThe city noise is so low\nIt might be why I'm feeling so alone\n\nAll the words you don't say\nI'm hearing anyway\nIt's written all on your face\nAnd I'm so tired of reading\n\nBetween the lines\nBetween the lines\nBetween the lines and I'm so tired of reading\n\nYou don't tell me\nNothing lately\nYou won't let me in just let me in\n\nAll the words you don't say\n\nI'm hearing anyway\nIt's written all on your face\nAnd I'm so tired of reading"
