Oh\n\nOf all of the plans that I could have made\n\nOf all of the nights that I couldn't sleep, oh\n\n\n\nWhat's a girl like you doing in a place like this?\n\nOn a crowded room, what are the odds?\n\nWhat's a guy like me doing in a place like this?\n\nGetting close to you, but here we are?\n\n\n\nWhat are the chances that we'd end up dancing?\n\nLike 2 in a million, like once in a life\n\nThat I could have found you, put my arms around you\n\nLike 2 in a million, like once in a life\n\nWhat are the chances?\n\n\n\nIs it love? Is it fate?\n\nWho am I? Who's to say?\n\nDon't know exactly what it means (Ooh, oh, yeah)\n\nIs it love? Is it fate?\n\nWhere it leads, who can say?\n\nMaybe you and I were meant to be\n\n\n\nWhat, what\n\nWhat are the chances that we'd end up dancing?\n\n2 in a million, once in a life\n\nThat I could have found you, put my arms around you (My arms around you)\n\nLike 2 in a million (It's like 2 in a million), like once in a life, yeah (Woah)\n\nWhat are the chances? (What are the chances?)\n\n2 in a million, once in a life\n\nWhat are the chances? (What are the chances?)\n\n2 in a million, once in a life\n\n\n\nWhat if I never run into you?\n\nAnd what if you never smiled at me?"
