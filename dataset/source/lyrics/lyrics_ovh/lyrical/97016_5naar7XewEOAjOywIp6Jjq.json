  "lyrics": "Thought I saw your shadow under the door\r\nJust a trick of the light I've seen before\r\nI can never tell what's real anymore\r\nAnymore, anymore\r\nI remember when we ran from the pool\n\nAll the decorations up in your room\n\nAnd I couldn't find the right words to use\n\nBut I knew that you knew\n\n\n\nIt seems so long, it seems so long\n\nThe moments that stay, they turn out all wrong\n\nWhen I look around, you're gone\n\n\n\nOhh, oh, oh\n\nOhh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nAll the places that we turn to\n\nAll the faces that remind you\n\n\n\nI can still see you at the place out there when I close my eyes\n\nDo you remember when we felt like the only two alive?\n\nDon't let me be one of the people at sea, get lost, nomads\n\nWould you rewind, do it all over again? Give it a chance\n\n\n\nOhh, oh, oh\n\nOhh, oh, oh\n\nOhh, oh, oh\n\nOhh, oh, oh"
