  "lyrics": "Time, it goes on waits for nobody special\r\nIn the prime of my years I'll remember you\r\nLivin' and breathin' and some misbelievin'\r\nBut I can't hold you woman, no piece of you\r\nYou were the magic, my only believer\r\nMy life on the line for you, all that I give to you\n\n\n\nTime is time\n\nDon't give me no time to waste away\n\nLove is love\n\nKeep me alive to my dying day\n\nNow is now\n\nWe capture the world\n\nAnd love will make it all right, all right\n\n\n\nTime, it goes on waits for nothing on over\n\nBut I still see your sun that you shine on me\n\nGiving and taking and always mistakin'\n\nBut I'll follow you woman, eternally\n\nYou were the magic, my only believer\n\nMy life on the line for you, all that I give to you\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n\nSetting my sights in one only direction\n\nSearching for romance and showing affection\n\nI guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark\n\nWaiting for your love\n\n\n\nTime is time\n\nDon't give me no wrong in makin' love\n\nLove is love, turn me around till you burn me up\n\nNow is now, we master the world\n\nAnd time will make it all right, all right"
