  "lyrics": "I don't think you want grand gestures\r\nJust a simple faithful friend\r\nSomeone who will walk it with you\r\nAll the way to the end\r\nSomeone who can live and love you\r\nSinging how I've come to know\n\nYou're like the sun that gives\n\nThe moon its glow\n\n\n\nYou're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\nYou're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\nAnd I know the wolves keep circling\n\nBut we'll leave them chasing tails\n\n'Cause you're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\n\n\nSo I kiss farewell to drama\n\nMy everything is you\n\nAnd after all the things that you've done\n\nOh, your love's been proved\n\nI'm not going back there\n\nNo, I've come to know\n\nYou're like the sun that gives\n\nThe moon its glow\n\n\n\nYou're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\nYou're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\nAnd I know the wolves keep circling\n\nBut I'll be safe with you\n\n'Cause you're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\n\n\nI need you, I need you\n\nI need you, I need you, I need you\n\nLord, every day\n\nI need you, I need you\n\nI need you, I need you, I need you\n\n\n\nYou're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\nYou're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\nAnd I know the wolves keep circling\n\nBut I'll be safe with you\n\n'Cause you're my, oh, you are my, my sweet refuge\n\n\n\nSweet refuge\n\nMy sweet refuge"
