  "lyrics": "I don't want the doctor to know that I don't wanna heal\r\n[?] but there's nothing to see here\r\nYou can't fix with Tylenol, a hundred dollar bill\r\nAnd all I need is time to forget all this\r\nI pulled a photo up from back in our youth\r\nIt looked a lot like me and it felt a lot like you\n\nThere ain't no one who can stop the change\n\nWe're crying out, maybe that's the end\n\n\n\n'Cause you've been leaning\n\nLeaning on the weight of my love\n\nNow you're sinking, sinking like a house in the mud\n\nAnd all I had was never enough\n\n\n\nI don't want the doctor to know that I know how to fix\n\nOr the reasons why I'm hung up on this\n\nI already know what's wrong, I need to get more sleep\n\nCan I be next to you for a couple weeks?\n\n\n\n'Cause you've been leaning\n\nLeaning on the weight of my love\n\nNow you're sinking, sinking like a house in the mud\n\nAnd all I had was never enough\n\n\n\nYou need Jesus now, he can fix you up\n\nAnd live in his castle, ride in his truck\n\nHe's got clouds for wheels\n\nAnd you ride around town, town, town, town\n\n\n\nYou've been leaning\n\nLeaning on the weight of my love\n\nNow you're sinking, sinking like a house in the mud\n\nAnd all I had was never enough"
