  "lyrics": "Forgo the falls which rain with fear farce are their depths\r\nIllusions are woven beings the masquerading of death\r\nWhere eternity folds itself to wind the projection reel\r\nA casket lowered renders the truth, an existence unveiled\n\nRejoice, commend, re-live\n\nThe beginning of ends\n\nRejoice, transcend, re-live\n\nThe beginning of ends\n\n\n\nSpiraling beyond this seamless seal\n\nLies a destined view of tranquility within flesh-less fields\n\n\n\nCommence thy spirit\n\n\n\nBehold this integral fate\n\nSpawn of radiant rapture and shape\n\nAs I fold & drift in this void\n\nI leave this world of fire, texture and taste\n\n\n\nIn the absence of light\n\nThat was coiled and bound\n\nI reflect upon the balance\n\nThat once shone\n\n\n\nHush, don't speak, no more\n\nThe feeling is gone\n\n\n\nOh, fleeting feeling of bond\n\nYou've been loyal in my loneliness\n\nYou aid my growth, build me to be strong\n\n\n\nRejoice, commend, re-live\n\nOh, the nothing, old friend\n\nRejoice, transcend, re-live\n\nOh, the nothing, old friend\n\n\n\nCommence thy spirit"
