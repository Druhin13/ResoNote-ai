  "lyrics": "I thought I might be better dead, but I was wrong\r\nI thought everything could fade, but I was wrong\r\nI thought I'd never find my place, but I was wrong\r\nAnd where I least wanted to look, it came along\r\nI thought sex was at my pace, but I was wrong\n\nI thought it mattered more I'd say, but I was wrong\n\nI thought you were second place to every song\n\nI thought you'd overstayed your welcome\n\nI was wrong, power on, power on\n\n\n\nHave you ever coexisted (Power on)\n\nSo easily?\n\nLet's go home and talk shit about everyone\n\nLet's go home, finally\n\n\n\nWill the waters ever still? That's what I want\n\nAnd with every inhalation I'm further up\n\n'Til I can only see the outline of the storm\n\nFrom space I can see that I was wrong\n\nPower on, power on\n\nPower on\n\nPower on\n\nPower on\n\n\n\nI thought I'd always have my way to come along\n\nI thought the table'd still be laid, but you were strong (You were strong)\n\nI thought that I could hide my face, but I was wrong\n\nAnd where I least want you to look, you carry on, carry on\n\n\n\nI thought sex was at my pace, but I was wrong\n\nI thought it mattered more I'd say, but I was wrong\n\nI thought you were second place to every song\n\nI thought you'd overstayed your welcome\n\nI was wrong, power on, power on\n\n\n\nHave you ever coexisted (Power on)\n\nSo easily?\n\n(Power on)\n\nLet's go home and talk shit about everyone\n\n(Power on)\n\nLet's go home, finally\n\n\n\nDrop the pen on the mood that you're in\n\nDrop the pen on the mood that you're in\n\nDrop the pen on the mood that you're in\n\nDrop the pen on the mood that you're in\n\nIf it feels like a home\n\nPower on, power on\n\nIf it feels like a home\n\nPower on, power on, power on\n\nIf it feels like a home\n\nPower on, power on, power on\n\nPower, power on\n\nPower on, power on, power on\n\nIf it feels like a home\n\nPower on"
