  "lyrics": "The day, the day that you left here\r\nA crown was placed upon me\r\nI was the king of nothing\r\nInside this cell of skin\r\nThoughts like ice against the wall\n\nIn a home where lies taught us all\n\nRelax into that place deep within\n\nDeep in the skin, you know where you’ve been\n\nWhy don’t you sing to me? A song of sanctuary\n\n\n\nYou could have all you wanted\n\nSing\n\nYou could build it all from nothing\n\nSing to me\n\nYou can live a life alone\n\nSanctuary\n\nBut you can never call this\n\n\n\nA home that’s beneath us\n\nSomewhere the light won’t reach us\n\nThe sky and the earth that birthed you\n\nJust another burden that hurts too\n\nMuch to say, just separate from all\n\nThese faces you cannot recall\n\nI’d do the same, and leave just how I came\n\n\n\nKing for today\n\nBut a fool forever\n\nRelax, and come on home\n\n\n\nYou could have all you wanted\n\nSing\n\nYou could build it all from nothing\n\nSing to me\n\nYou can live a life alone\n\nSanctuary\n\nBut you can never call this home\n\n\n\nYou can never call this home\n\nRelax deep within\n\nInside this cell of skin\n\nYou can never call this home\n\n\n\nKing today\n\nFool forever"
