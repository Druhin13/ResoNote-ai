  "lyrics": "Pass through the light and into the dark\r\nAlive in the wake of our collapse\r\nPolluted eyes, chemical hearts\r\nWe found a way to make money in the dark\r\nLeaders of all, oh how weve evolved\r\nMake a fist\n\nGive us the strength that we need to resist\n\nCast down, let chaos\n\nConsume us now\n\nWe fight to break free, free from these chains on our liberty\n\nA wolf in disguise, to prey on our fear\n\nThey found a way to make our fortune disappear\n\nLeaders of all, oh how weve evolved\n\nWhere are you now in our state of revolt\n\nGive us the strength that we need to resist\n\nCast down, let chaos\n\nConsume us now\n\nMake a fist\n\nGive us the strength that we need to resist\n\nCast down, let chaos\n\nConsume us now\n\nIts time to turn our heads, open our eyes, and follow our hearts\n\nFrom inside ourselves is where it must start\n\nBreaking waves of progress on the backs of the weak\n\nA face for the faithless armed with the answers we seek\n\nPray for the end, a shameless parade\n\nWatch as the structure collapses\n\nMisery ends as the structure collapses\n\nIndoctrination wearing thin\n\nBack to the wall, fall to the floor\n\nMisery ends as the structure collapses\n\nCast down, let chaos\n\nConsume us now"
