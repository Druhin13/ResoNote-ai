  "lyrics": "Honest enough\r\nWe could play the blame game too\r\nLook how much you livin' for the madness\r\nSomethin' bout the, roses at the end of your mattress\r\nRunnin' through reasons that you thought\n\nMoney would stop me\n\nI don't wanna be here too\n\nYou've never been up out here to excite\n\nIf you wanna trip I'll keep you\n\n\n\nHonest enough\n\nWe could play the blame game too\n\nPatience in the words I say\n\nUnravel at the sight of me\n\nHonest enough\n\nWe could play the blame game too\n\nPatience in the words I say (I say)\n\n\n\nIt's different than I remember\n\nIt's different then I told ya\n\nI don't think we want another fuckin' time to focus\n\nOn the things that we need\n\nJust another name to repeat\n\n\n\nCatchin' every breath, I'm out of practice\n\nSomethin' bout the, motives of the people you come after\n\nRunnin' through reasons that you thought\n\nMoney wouldn't stop me\n\nI don't want to be here too\n\nYou've never been up out here to excite\n\nIf you wanna trip I'll keep you\n\n\n\nHonest enough\n\nWe could play the blame game too\n\nPatience in the words I say\n\nUnravel at the sight of me\n\nHonest enough\n\nWe could play the blame game too\n\nPatience in the words I say (I say)"
