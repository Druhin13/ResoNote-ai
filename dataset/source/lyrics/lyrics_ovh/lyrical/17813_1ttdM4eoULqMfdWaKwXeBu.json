  "lyrics": "You took all the lonely days and you made them sing\r\nYou turned off the alarms so they don't ring\r\nI don't know where we are in the grand scheme of things\r\nBut I just want to be hugging you tonight\r\nLife did throw everything that it could throw\n\nYour face in the morning, it just glowed\n\nLet's get in this car, let's face the sky and go\n\nI just wanna be counting stars with you\n\n\n\nRap it up and let's go rolling down\n\nThere's no funnier duo in this town\n\nJust want to say I'm better now and shout it loud\n\nI just want to be hugging you tonight\n\n\n\nDon't know if you know, but I just wanna tell you so\n\nThat you're the wisest funny one that I will ever, ever know\n\nA hundred mini dreams and a healing scar\n\nThe secrets of the day are never far\n\nI don't know where we're going but God it's a start\n\nI just wanna be counting stars with you\n\n\n\nI don't know if you know, but I just wanna tell you so\n\nThat you're the wisest funny one that I will ever, ever know\n\nI don't know about you but, oh, I love us as a two\n\nFind me a wild road and I will name it after you\n\n\n\nYou took all the lonely days and made them sing\n\nYou turned off the alarms so they don't ring\n\nI don't know where we are in the grand scheme of things\n\nBut I just wanna be hugging you tonight"
