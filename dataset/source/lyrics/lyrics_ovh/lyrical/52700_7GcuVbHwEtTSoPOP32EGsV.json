  "lyrics": "In this town, forget who you are\r\nRemembering who you were meant to be\r\nFind yourself bearing easy\r\nMercury aside a Lurex sea\r\nSuch cloth is this\n\nIt's thread for a party dress\n\n\n\nThe lights are strung like pearls\n\nSo offer your throat\n\nAnd if we hang, then we hang in the stars\n\nTake my hand and come\n\nBe the hostess girl\n\nSkip a grace note on your heel\n\nTo whichever hymn you please\n\nFor the Rarest Birds are these\n\n\n\nNavigate the city walks\n\nBy dove-grey gum constellations\n\nThere the twins and there the plough\n\nAnd now I'm at your door\n\n\n\nSeeing you through your window\n\nFixing your hair for grey\n\nPulling at your face\n\nTrying not to frown like this\n\nAnd you hold up your party dress\n\n\n\nThe lights on strings like pearls\n\nLet's take on the night\n\nAnd if we hang, then we hang in the stars\n\nHold my hand and come\n\nBe the fairground girl\n\nWe can walk the fairground town tonight\n\nHung up by a breeze\n\nAs high as you please\n\nHiss the kittens away\n\nThey'll know something some day\n\nIt's only ground that they see\n\nFor the Rarest Birds are these\n\nTo whichever sky they please"
