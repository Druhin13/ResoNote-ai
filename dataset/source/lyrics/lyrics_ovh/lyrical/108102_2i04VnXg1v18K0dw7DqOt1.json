I don't know\r\nMy brother told me, \"Life's not a pain\"\r\nThat was right when it started to rain\r\nWhere am I going wrong? I don't know\n\n\n\nBut it's alright, sleep tight\n\nI will take the strain\n\nYou'll find, love of mine\n\nYou will feel no pain\n\n\n\nWell, I see trouble at every turn\n\nI've got so many lessons to learn\n\nWhat am I doin' wrong? I don't know\n\nNow what's the matter with me?\n\nAm I right? Am I wrong?\n\nNow I started to see\n\nI must try to be strong\n\nI try to love you best as I can\n\nBut you know that I won't be your man\n\nWhere am I going wrong? I don't know\n\n\n\nOoh, yeah\n\nOh, woah, woah, woah, mhmm\n\n\n\nBut it's alright, sleep tight\n\nI will take the strain\n\nYou'll find, little love of mine\n\nYou will feel no pain\n\n\n\nI got crows at my window and dogs at my door\n\nBut I don't think I can take anymore\n\nWhat am I doin' wrong? I don't know\n\nNow what's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know\n\nWhat's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know\n\nWhat's the matter with me? I don't know, I don't know"
