Oh, no\r\nI know I've done wrong, I'll pay for it\r\nIt's your turn to talk, for once I'm listenin'\n\n\n\nSay that you don't want me\n\nSay that you don't need me\n\nTell me I'm the fool\n\nTell me you've been tortured\n\nTell me you've been beaten\n\nAnd what I've done to you\n\nEven if it doesn't matter\n\nMatter what's true\n\nSay that you don't want me\n\nSay that you don't need me\n\nTell me I'm the fool\n\n\n\nLook at all this heartache, what is left?\n\nForgetting how it started, this is how it ends, oh no\n\nI know I've done some wrong, I'll pay for it\n\nBut it's your turn to talk, for once I'm listening\n\n\n\nSay that you don't want me\n\nSay that you don't need me\n\nTell me I'm the fool\n\nTell me you've been tortured\n\nTell me you've been beaten\n\nAnd what I've done to you\n\nEven if it doesn't matter\n\nMatter what's true\n\nTell me that I'm unknown\n\nTo you\n\n\n\nOh-oh, oh, oh\n\nOh-oh, oh\n\n\n\nSay that you don't want me\n\nSay that you don't need me\n\nTell me I'm the fool\n\nTell me you've been tortured\n\nTell me you've been beaten\n\nAnd what I've done to you\n\nAnd even if it doesn't matter\n\nMatter what's true\n\nSay that you don't want me\n\nSay that you don't need me\n\nTell me I'm the fool\n\n\n\nTell me that it's over\n\nTell me that you mean it\n\nThis time is true\n\nTell me that I'm unknown\n\nTo you"
