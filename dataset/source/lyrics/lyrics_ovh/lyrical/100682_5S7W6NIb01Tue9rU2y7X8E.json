  "lyrics": "Nature's always been death and rebirth\r\nJust as the forests must burn down for regrowth\r\nSociety must be burnt too\r\nOur urges can't be stopped\r\nThe wise follow only greed\r\nThe light they speak of only blinds you of their theft\n\nThe luggagery they live in deprives you of your resources\n\nThe work they employ to force you into servitude\n\nReady yourself of their shackles\n\nFollow your heart\n\nGive into your primal core\n\nReact\n\nJoin\n\nThe Wicked"
