  "lyrics": "Where did we begin?\r\nBack in the days we lived inside each other's skin\r\nWe cuddled like we never needed anything\r\nThink of what you'd have to pack\r\nIf you left and planned on never coming back\r\nJust the thought of it can stop you in your tracks\n\nAnd make you stay\n\n\n\nOh but where i'd like to be\n\nIs on a dancefloor with some drinks inside of me\n\nSomeone whispering it's quarter after 3\n\nThere's no where I'd rather be\n\n\n\nSo we talk about this\n\nIn a tone that suggests anybody cares\n\nSo excited each time anybody dares\n\nAnd who's your next to call?\n\nWho's impossible?\n\nAnd who's too close to call?\n\nWho's just desperate for anything at all?\n\nAnything at all, like love...\n\n\n\nOh but where i'd like to be\n\nIs on a dancefloor with my friends all pissed at me\n\nSomeone singing and I realise it's me\n\nI realise it's me\n\n\n\nPlay me good times, shame\n\nGolden years, let the music play\n\nGood times, shame\n\nGolden years, let the music play\n\n\n\nOh it's where i'd like to be\n\nIs on a dancefloor with some drinks inside of me\n\n\n\nOh it's where i'd like to be\n\nIs on a dancefloor with some drinks inside of me\n\n\n\nOh it's where I'd like to be\n\nOh it's where I'd like to be\n\n\n\nOn a dancefloor\n\nOn a dancefloor\n\nOn a dancefloor"
