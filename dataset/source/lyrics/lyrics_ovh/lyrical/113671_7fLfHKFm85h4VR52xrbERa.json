  "lyrics": "She hypnotised me with her groove\r\nShe collects the stars and simple moon\r\nShe might say she don't but then she do\r\nShe before I wake up with nothing I know\r\nThere ain't no God or man could kill the burning fire\n\nShe is born in the middle of my soul\n\nIf you wait too long to taste the jewel\n\nJewel is gone, the lights are off\n\nBut you have run out of time\n\n\n\nShe will fill my bones and veins\n\nShe's the poison that will save you\n\nShe collects the laughter and the tears\n\nShe burns down the barns and sets your fears free\n\n\n\nThere ain't no God or man could kill the burning fire\n\nShe is born in the middle of my soul\n\nIf you wait too long to taste the jewel\n\nJewel is gone, the lights are off\n\nBut you have run out of time\n\n\n\nShe makes me feel like I'm falling under\n\nShe aspell like karma break, no wonder\n\nShe will leave the metal in the wound\n\nShe still hypnotised me with her groove\n\nShe knows\n\n\n\nThere ain't no God or man could kill the burning fire\n\nShe is born in the middle of my soul\n\nIf you wait too long to taste the jewel\n\nJewel is gone, the lights are off\n\nBut you have run out of time"
