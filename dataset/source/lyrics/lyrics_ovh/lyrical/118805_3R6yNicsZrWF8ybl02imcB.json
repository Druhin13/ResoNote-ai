  "lyrics": "Charleston girl in a darkened room\r\nAnd you don't know her like I do\r\nWe took the fire escape to her room\r\nAnd got stoned, ragin' blind\r\nLeft my money in the trustin' hands\r\nOf them ol' steel brothers and fast crash band\n\nOne day, I'm gonna drive up there, and give them half my mind\n\n\n\nI don't know if it's the wine or the coke\n\nThat makes her sound like her jaw is broke\n\nShe's workin' hard to make some sense, but she ain't got a dime\n\nI wish to God that I could help her out\n\nI wish I knew what she was talkin' bout\n\nI wish to God that I could get away, but I'm way too drunk to drive\n\n\n\nAll I know is that when I am good and sober\n\nI am leaving West Virginia for a while\n\nDon't know why but every time I cross that river\n\nLord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild\n\n\n\nCharleston girl with raven hair, bloodshot eyes and skin so fair\n\nI believe if I could find my keys, I'd try to drive away\n\nI never planned to leave so soon\n\nI didn't know that he was sweet on you\n\nGo ahead and take her\n\n'Cause she ain't worth the time\n\n\n\nAll I know is that when I am good and sober\n\nI am leaving West Virginia for a while\n\nDon't know why but every time I cross that river\n\nLord, there's somethin' tears me up, makes me wild."
