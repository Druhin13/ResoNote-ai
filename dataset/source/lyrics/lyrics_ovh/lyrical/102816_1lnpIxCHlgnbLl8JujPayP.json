  "lyrics": "Life is so strange when its changin', yes indeed \nWell I've seen the hard times and the pressures been on me \nBut I keep on workin' like the workin' man do \nAnd I've got my act together, gonna walk all over you \nGimme back my bullets \nPut 'em back where they belong \n\nAin't foolin' around, 'cause I done had my fun \n\nAin't gonna see no more damage done \n\nGimme back my bullets\n\n\n\nSweet talkin' people done ran me out of town \n\nI drank enough whiskey to float a battleship around \n\nBut I'm leavin' this game one step ahead of you \n\nAnd you will not hear me cry 'cause I do not sing the blues\n\n\n\nGimme back my bullets \n\nPut 'em back where they belong \n\nAin't foolin' around, 'cause I done had my fun \n\nAin't gonna see no more damage done \n\nGimme back, gimme back my bullets \n\nPut 'em back where they belong\n\n\n\nBeen up and down since I turned seventeen \n\nWell I've been on top, and then it seems I lost my dream \n\nBut I got it back, I'm feelin' better everyday \n\nTell all them pencil pushers, better get out of my way \n\nGimme back my bullets \n\nPut 'em back where they belong \n\nAin't foolin' around, 'cause I done had my fun \n\nAin't gonna see no more damage done \n\nGimme back, gimme back my bullets \n\nOh put 'em back where they belong \n\nGimme back my bullets"
