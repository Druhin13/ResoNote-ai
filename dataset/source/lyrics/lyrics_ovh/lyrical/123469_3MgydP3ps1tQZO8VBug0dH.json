When is hip-hop coming back on the scene?\r\nWhen is real shit gonna be showin' up on my screen?\n\nWhy these wack little kids out thinkin' they the king?\n\nI've been in these gladiator pits workin' on my swing\n\nCall me Maximus, on every track I bust\n\nYou just ain't quick enough on the draw, ain't fast enough\n\nTo spar with Godzilla, you don't have the guts\n\nAnd just the thing, these the cats that used to laugh at us\n\nAnd call me, a fucking loser 'cause I sat on my computer\n\nJust playing Command and Conquer, now I have conquered the future\n\nSo keep on spreadin' rumors and keep on thinking you cooler\n\nBut you're neutered, no balls at all comin' through ya better run\n\nListen, I'ma count to 6, before I break 'em down like I got an ounce to flip\n\nI'll crush your motherfuckin' skull like the mountain bitch\n\nAnd put it in a song, let the people bounce to this\n\nI'm bringing you that sound you missed, that lyrical flow\n\nAll that shit that you don't hear anymore\n\nAnd know Webby goin' sick a lot, ammunition box full of 50 shots\n\nAnd got a couple torpedoes for all these Little Yachts\n\nThey scared of me like I'm tucking a sawed-off\n\nThey know that if they steppin' up they'll be in my Raw Thoughts\n\nFuck it, I'm raw dog\n\nPause\n\nAll I'm saying's I don't give a fuck, I'll be comin' at all y'all\n\nThat Molotov flow, I'ma scorch the ground\n\nI tore shit down and torched them, now all around\n\nThey bow to their new king as I wore the crown\n\nThey can't ignore the sounds, I'm a warrior now\n\nAnd I'ma call 'em out (Why?)\n\n'Cause fuck 'em, that's why\n\nThe shit that y'all been bumping is some fuckin' trash, I will not stand and watch as my love of rap dies\n\nSo I guess I gotta be the motherfuckin' bad guy\n\n\n\nBut I wish I had some friends in this game and shit\n\nI got 'em all scared by the flames I spit, and claims I make\n\nThey thinkin' that I'm dangerous\n\nSo now, nobody ever wanna play with Chris\n\nWhich is fine, I'm an only child anyway\n\nThis is how it's always been, live it everyday\n\nThey see the look up in my eyes and they get afraid\n\nSo I'm all by myself here as I play\n\n\n\nMotherfuckin' Solitaire\n\nThey don't wanna play with me, they afraid of me, I know\n\n(Listen, I don't need no help, I'ma do this shit by myself)\n\nLike it's motherfuckin' Solitaire\n\nThey don't wanna play with me, they afraid of me, I know\n\n(Listen, I don't need no help, I'ma do this shit by myself)\n\n\n\nIf rap was a video game, you'd play on G-Eazy\n\nMe, I'm G, expert mode, please believe me\n\nSteezy, put this shit down for CT\n\nI can't leave rap alone, the game needs me\n\nI am the mic, the microphone killa\n\nYou got no chance, like fist fightin' gorillas\n\nAnd since Mac Miller unfollowed me on Twitter\n\nI've been a little bitter, but kept on getting bigger\n\nWhile the game ignored me I've been sippin' 40's\n\nSmokin' hella weed, watching Rick and Morty\n\nFocused on my dream 'til that shit was morphing\n\nInto the real thing, now I live my story\n\nChris was born to rule so I'll ride out the storm of wackness\n\nWhich is now the societal norm\n\nI'm so fuckin' good at my job, I don't try anymore\n\nIt's autopilot when I go and grab the mic and record\n\nThe shit you couldn't buy in the store, indeed I flow\n\nAn animal, follow my name with E-I-O\n\nLike Old Mcdonald, try to follow as I speak I know\n\nI'm crazy, la vida loca, fee fie foe\n\nUm. you're done when I come through to take your head\n\nAnd grind your bones into dust just to make my bread\n\nWith bacon, egg, and cheese, shit I'm stayin' fed\n\nAnd killing everything until the fuckin' day I'm dead\n\nTryna bring that fire back, my time is gonna be\n\nRight now, shit, I see it right in front of me\n\nBut I'm also watching hip-hop decline and wondering\n\nHow these other lyricists could stand by so comfortably\n\nAs the shit we grew up on dissolves, devolves\n\nTo what we got now, Mumble Rap, top of the charts\n\nNo more skill, no more soul, and no more bars\n\nNo respect for the OG's who started it all\n\n\n\nIt's almost like if you know how to rap, than it's wack to these kids\n\nAll they care about is swagger and cash\n\nAnd the tats on your face and the likes on your post\n\nAin't no passion for the craft, it's all hype, it's a joke\n\nBut I'll have the last laugh, 'cause I'm bound to be\n\nA legend of the new school you're about to see\n\nWhy everybody running full speed down the street\n\n'Cause they scared to throw it down with me\n\nIt's like I'm playing\n\n\n\nFuckin' Solitaire\n\nThey don't wanna play with me, they afraid of me, I know\n\n(Listen, I don't need no help, I'ma do this shit by myself)\n\nLike it's motherfuckin' Solitaire\n\nThey don't wanna play with me, they afraid of me, I know\n\n(Listen, I don't need no help, I'ma do this shit by myself)"
