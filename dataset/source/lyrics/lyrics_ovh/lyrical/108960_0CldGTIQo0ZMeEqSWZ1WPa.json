  "lyrics": "(Christine McVie)\r\nOhh you're a dream\r\nHide your head in the sand\r\nYou're far away, when I want you around\r\nAnd you leave me lonely when I'm feeling down\n\nDo your ever wonder, or worry about me\n\nDid I ever love you, did you ever love me\n\nDo your ever wonder, or worry about me\n\nDid I ever love you, did you ever love me\n\nWhy is it baby, our love just won't grow\n\nYou made me happy but time has gone by\n\nPlease leave me softly, I won't say goodbye\n\nSo all I wanted slips through my hands\n\nYou're far away when I want you around\n\nAnd you leave me lonely when I'm feeling down\n\nDo your ever wonder, or worry about me\n\nDid I ever love you, did you ever love me\n\nDo your ever wonder, or worry about me\n\nDid I ever love you, did you ever love me"
