  "lyrics": "Carefull what you say\r\nThis time of year\r\nTends to weaken me\r\nAnd have a little decency\r\nAnd let me cry in peace\r\nBut there's a place where I\n\nErase the challenges I've been through\n\nWhere I know every corner,\n\nEvery street-name\n\nall by heart\n\n\n\nAnd so it is a part of my\n\ncourageous plan to leave\n\nWith a broken heart\n\nTucked away under my sleeve\n\n\n\nI wanna go home for Christmas\n\nLet me go home this year\n\nI wanna go home for Christmas\n\nLet me go home this year\n\n\n\nI'll pack my bags\n\nand leave before the sun rises tomorrow\n\n'cause we act more like strangers for each day\n\nThat I am here\n\nBut I have people close to me\n\nWho never will desert me\n\nWho remind me frequently\n\nWhat I was like as a child\n\n\n\nAnd so it is a part of my\n\ncourageous plan to leave\n\nWith a broken heart\n\nTucked away under my sleeve\n\n\n\nI wanna go home for Christmas\n\nLet me go home this year\n\nI wanna go home for Christmas\n\nLet me go home this year\n\n\n\nI don't know what my future holds\n\nor who I'll choose to love me\n\nBut I can tell you where I'm from\n\nAnd who loved me to life\n\n\n\nAnd so it is a part of my\n\ncourageous plan to leave\n\nWith a broken heart\n\nTucked away under my sleeve\n\n\n\nI wanna go home for Christmas\n\nLet me go home this year\n\nI wanna go home for Christmas\n\nLet me go home this year"
