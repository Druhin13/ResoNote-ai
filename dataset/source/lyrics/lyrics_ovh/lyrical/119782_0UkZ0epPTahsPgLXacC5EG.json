  "lyrics": "I would take a bullet\r\nAnd you wouldn’t even notice\r\nTil' the sirens come\r\nAnd I will build a palace\r\nBut I know you’d probably rather just\r\nA room for one\n\nAnd I know\n\nI never keep my promises\n\nBut you’re the one I’m breaking them for\n\nSo what’s the use in all this if\n\n\n\nI’ll never be worthy of you\n\nI’m broken, and beat up, and bruised\n\nI’ve proven all that I can prove\n\nThere’s nothing that I won’t do\n\nBut I’ll never be worthy of you, yeah\n\n\n\nYou could watch me drown\n\nBut I’d be 6 feet underground, before you realize\n\nAnd I’d go clinically insane just to meet all your expectations\n\nYeah, I’d lose my mind\n\nAnd I know, that I’m not always innocent\n\nBut every sin, I did it for you\n\nSo what’s the use in all of this if\n\n\n\nI’ll never be worthy of you\n\nI’m broken, and beat up, and bruised\n\nI’ve proven all that I can prove\n\nThere’s nothing that I won’t do\n\nBut, I’ll never be worthy of you\n\n\n\nI’ve tried and I’ve tried\n\nPure sacrifice\n\nSo come with me\n\nFallin' and fallin'\n\nNowhere at all\n\nWhat do you want from me? Yeah\n\nI’m broken and beat up and bruised\n\nI’ve proven all that I can prove\n\nThere’s nothing that I wouldn’t do\n\n\n\nI’ll never be worthy of you\n\nI’m broken, and beat up, and bruised\n\nI’ve proven all that I can prove\n\nThere’s nothing that I won’t do\n\nBut, I’ll never be worthy of you\n\n\n\nWorthy of you\n\nI’ll never be worthy of you"
