  "lyrics": "I can withstand\r\nJust about anything but losing you\r\nIf I can have\r\nYou then I just don't know what to do\r\nCaught by surprise\r\nThe girl that I'm speaking of, she's walking out on me\n\nTeardrops explode\n\nCracking the pavement under my feet\n\n\n\nThere is a sadness that creeps up\n\nEvery time you're far away\n\nPut an end to this madness\n\nOh darling, I'm fading out\n\n\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou\n\n\n\nDeserted again\n\nWhere are my friends? I can't rely on them\n\nSeasick and soaked\n\nDrowning my fears with flat coca cola\n\nNo bus ticket in hand\n\nNo change in my pocket, there is nothing left\n\nAnd now it's Saturday night\n\nI swear that it used to be better than this\n\n\n\nThere is a sadness that creeps up\n\nEvery time you're far away\n\nPut an end to this madness\n\nOh darling, I'm fading out\n\n\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou\n\n\n\nYou\n\nYou\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou\n\n\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou\n\nThere's nothing but you\n\nYou"
