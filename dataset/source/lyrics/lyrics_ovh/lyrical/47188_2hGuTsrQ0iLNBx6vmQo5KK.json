  "lyrics": "I know your eyes in the morning sun\r\nI feel you touch me in the pouring rain\r\nAnd the moment that you wander far from me\r\nI wanna feel you in my arms again\r\nAnd you come to me on a summer breeze\n\nKeep me warm in your love then you softly leave\n\nAnd it's me you need to show how deep is your love\n\n\n\nIs your love, how deep is your love\n\nI really mean to learn\n\nCause we're living in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down\n\nWhen they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me\n\n\n\nI believe in you, you know the door to my very soul\n\nYou're the light in my deepest darkest hour\n\nYou're my saviour when I fall\n\nAnd you may not think that I care for you\n\nWhen you know down inside that I really do\n\nAnd it's me you need to show how deep is your love\n\n\n\nIs your love, how deep is your love\n\nI really mean to learn\n\nCause we're living in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down\n\nWhen they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me\n\n\n\nAnd you come to me on a summer breeze\n\nKeep me warm in your love and then you softly leave\n\nAnd it's me you need to show how deep is your love\n\n\n\nIs your love, how deep is your love\n\nI really mean to learn\n\nCause we're living in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down\n\nWhen they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me\n\n\n\nHow deep is your love, how deep is your love\n\nI really mean to learn\n\nCause we're living in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down\n\nWhen they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me\n\n\n\nHow deep is your love, how deep is your love\n\nI really mean to learn\n\nCause we're living in a world of fools\n\nBreaking us down\n\nWhen they all should let us be\n\nWe belong to you and me"
