  "lyrics": "I take my time\r\nI don’t do well with attention\r\nI’m so used to staying in\r\nTo keep my walls from caving in\r\nAnd I am a ghost\r\nI wander in circles around you\n\nI wanna breathe the air you breathe\n\nBut all this smoke is killing me\n\n\n\nI find ways to disappear\n\nAnd my words are never clear\n\nI gotta find a way to face the things I fear\n\nI’m not good at letting go\n\nI can’t stand to be alone\n\nAre you the light that leads me down the road?\n\nCan you take me home?\n\n\n\nI’m dragging it out\n\nI hold on tightly to memories\n\n'Cause I’m scared of what will show\n\nIt might be best if you never know\n\nI wanna run away\n\nWanna start a war\n\n'Til my knuckles bleed\n\nI need you, nothing more\n\nI’ve been lying to all of you\n\n'Cause I’ve been trying to face the truth\n\n\n\nI find ways to disappear\n\nAnd my words are never clear\n\nI gotta find a way to face the things I fear\n\nI’m not good at letting go\n\nI can’t stand to be alone\n\nAre you the light that leads me down the road?\n\nCan you take me home?\n\n\n\nI find ways to disappear\n\nAnd my words are never clear\n\nI gotta find a way to face the things I fear\n\nI’m not good at letting go\n\nI can’t stand to be alone\n\nI found the light that takes me down the road\n\nUntil it leads me home\n\nUntil it leads me home\n\nUntil it leads me home\n\nI found the light that takes me down the road\n\nUntil it leads me home"
