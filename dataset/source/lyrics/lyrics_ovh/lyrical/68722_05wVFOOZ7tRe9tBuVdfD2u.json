  "lyrics": "Hopeless heroes beat this claptrap haven\r\nRats bigger that the noiseless generation\r\nWho the hell is Dow Jones anyway\r\nSociety's bones on a cafeteria tray\r\nThe feeling is the brain is split\n\nFrom smiles to stares to baseless shit\n\nWalk off the shock to a beacon soul breathing\n\nA helping hand against eternal lying\n\n\n\nAsked to believe in traditions reasoning\n\nTo turn a blind eye to the monkey trial bleeding\n\nWorking to fight off disease beat the clock\n\nSaviors passing on the street\n\n\n\nCovert creations without sound\n\nMirage is ruthless stumbling around\n\nDarlings of deceit hyperbole\n\nReverse the flow of negative energy"
