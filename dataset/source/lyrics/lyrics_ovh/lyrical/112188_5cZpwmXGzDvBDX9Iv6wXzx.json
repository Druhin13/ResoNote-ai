  "lyrics": "This remind me of before we had insomnia\r\nSleepin' peacefully, never needed a pile of drugs\r\nEverybody was college-bound, no dollar amounts\r\nIn God we trust, senior year my prom ain't had no party bus\r\nMy cousin hit me on Facebook, like \"What shorty you takin'?\"\r\nI'm lyin', I'm playin', I'm sayin', \"I got one to take, and I'm waitin' on her response\"\n\nWrote her a 3 page letter, it's 3 days later, never hit me back, she broke my heart\n\nSo now he IM'ing me shit like, \"Yo' is shorty bad?\"\n\nI pretend not to be depressed, she never wrote me back\n\nI hit him back like \"Yo', well fuck her, it's on to the next\"\n\nI wrote that message thinkin' I'm awkward, prolly' would never have sex\n\nYou know in high school, 16 you prolly late\n\nMy cousin hit me back, \"Don't trip, bro. I got you a date.\"\n\nSo he sent me this link to some girl I had never seen\n\nHe said to call and tell her \"Walter said that you with me.\"\n\nI think about it for a minute, like what's his intentions?\n\nI mean, we never really got along or used to kick it\n\nIn fact, if I remember vividly, he picked on me\n\nHe used to beat me up and take my sneakers every family visit\n\nI'm skeptical to let her know I'm Walter little cousin\n\nWhat if this shit all a joke, but then again, what if it wasn't?\n\nWould I really risk the chance of me potentially fuckin'\n\nOn some stranger daughter 'cause I barely know if I can trust him?\n\nProlly not\n\nI finally called her, tell her Walter sent me, \"My name Tahj\"\n\nShe asked me what's the color scheme that we gon' wear to prom\n\nI'm actin' like I'm not excited, tryna play it off\n\n\"So what's the car we're takin'?\" \"Worst come worst, my mom can take us\"\n\nI'll call Walter, thank him, he said don't trip and just wear black\n\nHe said she cool and they go back, if any problems, send him back\n\nI never had to, but now we're in tune\n\nHe Facebook messaged me like, \"Sorry not to be a nuisance...\"\n\nBut he like 30 dollars short on all his prom suit shit\n\nI'm like, \"I got you, cuz. That's the least that I can do.\"\n\nHe tell me send him the addy and he'll slide after school\n\nI'm like, \"Ok, bet,\" never knew where he stayed at\n\nHe walked down the street, hella surprised, \"This where y'all place at?\"\n\nUncle Carl, Auntie Deborah, my cousin Rena\n\nAnd I'm surprised too, my family knew, kept us a secret\n\nMe and cuz stay down the street, living different lives\n\nEveryday he on the bus, me, I get a ride\n\nI gave him 30 on the porch, he never went inside\n\nHe tell me, \"Thank you,\" then he walked back home with a smile\n\nHe tryna hide it, but I see his dimple\n\nI'm thinkin', \"Damn, that transaction was simple\"\n\nI'm talking shit, I know he hoop, I'm like, \"Aye, where the rim, bro?\"\n\nHe like, \"Tomorrow, if you free, you prolly weak as shit, tho.\"\n\nI know my brother not\n\nSo all 3 of us went to the park and ran some niggas off the court\n\nI'm hella passive, I was passin', I ain't have to score\n\nThe next day the prom, I couldn't sleep, I stayed up\n\nMy granddad gave me a condom then walked away, didn't say nothin'\n\nShe hopped out of her car and said that her name was Jada\n\nMy heart's racin', I'm focused, I'm tryna keep it playa\n\nGave her the croissant, or corsage or whatever the fuck my mom handed me\n\nAnd said, \"Now put it on her hand, Malik\", family ties\n\nMy grandfather taught me how to tie up a tie 'cause my dad lived in NY\n\nThat's prolly why I was shy, so self-conscious\n\nTook pictures on the porch, and then we headed for the prom and\n\nWalter went on prom the same day, but to a different place\n\nSo he text me like, \"Cuz, this the spot. Let's meet up later\n\nAnd bring Jada through,\" prom flashed, I kept it cool\n\nWe show up to the function where she brought a change of clothes\n\nI'm lookin' around like, \"Damn, I don't know nobody\"\n\nWe at this party out West and Jada left to get dressed\n\nI'm fakin' like I'm sendin' text\n\nSome stranger get really close, I swear that I hear his breath\n\nThen he put a knife to my neck\n\nGave me the run down like, \"Jada my sister\n\nAnd if you hit her, fuck her, make her miss ya, I'ma kill ya!\"\n\nAt this point, I'm just exhausted\n\nWonderin' where the fuck's Walter\n\nHe shows up like 30 minutes after our altercation\n\nI never mentioned it to him, he kinda overprotective\n\nAnd I know if I tell him, that he'll beat this nigga's skull in\n\nTurn his body a skeleton, and our night'll end terrible\n\nI exhale and say, \"Fuck it\", and I just chose to let it go\n\n\n\n\n\nWalt went to St. Louis, had a full ride for his hoopin'\n\nHim and his coach got into it, now he back home doin' music, aye\n\nI was at Columbia, again a straight A student\n\nI had one B in a hip-hop class, I thought that shit was stupid\n\nHe transferred to Robert Morris, always livid down the street\n\nMy class let out at 2:40 and his class let out at 3\n\nMama asked me where the hell I been and where the hell I be\n\n\"I'm with Walter, mom,\" I say, I keep walkin' in here late\n\nI might fall off in your bed, I get girls now, I get laid\n\nI get caught up followin' Walter, I'm a product of my age\n\nHe talk to erry' girl in downtown Chicago\n\nWingman, I cannot fly tho\n\nHe was in Cal with Impala, he was that nigga in the party\n\nAwfully popular for someone that they barely mention\n\nPlus we from the part of city that they barely mention\n\nJust logged into Twitter and somehow we was barely mentioned\n\nWe signed our names on the Open Mic' list and then they skipped us\n\nAnd then they skipped us again like a week later\n\nLike, obviously this fuckin' host can't read the paper\n\nHella' intimidatin', the big guy didn't have to flex\n\nSo Walter walked to the host and said, \"This the name you're callin' next\"\n\nBullied our way to the stage and then overstayed our welcome\n\nAn apple never get too far from the tree that it fell from\n\nJust like my father tryna do music and hope I make it\n\nWalter joined me for the journey said the city waitin'\n\nPIVOT\n\nWalter invincible, dodged death like a mad magician\n\nMore times than a mathematician\n\nI'm in LA workin' on Bucket List Project, I get a call and get a fishy feeling\n\nNormally Walter joke on the phone, this time he over serious\n\nMy heart droppin', I'm like, \"Yo, what is it?!\"\n\nHe say he with T.Y on the highway and some niggas just tried to kill him\n\nEmptied the clip on the car, but somehow they didn't hit him\n\nSometimes I fuckin' hate Chicago, 'cause I hate this feelin'\n\nInnocent niggas get shot at, in the broad day, the A.M\n\nI asked him for a play-by-play of how their whole day went\n\nHe said he went to XSport, and they ran a full court\n\nAnd I can not retort without thinkin' that this can't be the reason\n\n\"So what else you do? What about Ty? Is he still cool?\n\nWhere were you on your way from, and where were you on your way to?\n\nHe say he just left for dinner at a friend crib, and that's it\n\nHe say \"Tahj, don't do shit but smoke, Honestly Saba, that's it\"\n\nGive him sympathy, another case of mistaken identity\n\nThe news prolly' gon' run this, as two gangs from different streets\n\nPolice questionin' him like he just shot at a trooper\n\nMy boy walked away unharmed, and we did Lollapalooza, yeah\n\n6 months pass by, everyday we celebrate, everyday a better day\n\nI just dropped \"Bucket List\", Walter 'bout to drop a tape\n\nEverything goin' perfect, couldn't paint a better way\n\nPIVOT gang is on the way, we just sold out Lincoln Hall\n\nThen I went to talk to Sway\n\nI got back home and got back on it, 'cause Walter was doin' tour dates\n\nSendin' me links to songs that he made, Kid Cudi, we are not ridin' no waves, aye\n\nGrandma made us blanky plates, we played 2K, that's just a day before\n\nFatimah got a show tomorrow, he text me, \"We in that hoe\"\n\nI went to the barbershop, the first thing the next mornin'\n\nThen I got up with Legit, we supposed to do some recordin'\n\n10 minutes into this session, I got a call from a number\n\nThat I don't got saved, but I answer anyways\n\nShe says, \"Hello, Malik, have you or Squeak\n\nTalked to my son today? He was just on the train.\"\n\nWe got in the car, but we didn't know where to drive to\n\nFuck it, wherever you are my nigga, we'll come and find you...\n\n\n\nJust another day in the ghetto\n\nOh, the streets bring sorrow\n\nCan't get out today with a schedule\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow\n\nI just hope I make it 'til tomorrow"
