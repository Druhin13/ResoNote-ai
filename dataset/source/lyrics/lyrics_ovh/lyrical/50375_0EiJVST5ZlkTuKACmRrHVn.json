  "lyrics": "Something hides in every night\r\nBrings desire from the deep\r\nAnd with it comes a burning light\r\nTo keep us from our sleep\r\nAnd as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine\n\nGlances of a new day have arrived\n\nAnd though he’s not alone, he fears to never love another\n\nAnd leave his heart forever with her smile\n\n\n\nHaa-aah\n\n\n\nHabibi, light is burning\n\nAs I am burning\n\nHabibi, light is burning\n\nAs I am yearning\n\n\n\nSomething died within a soul\n\nLeft the eyes to rust\n\nAnd every time it is recalled\n\nIt covers all in dust\n\nHaa-aah\n\n\n\nHabibi, light is burning\n\nAs I am burning\n\nHabibi, light is burning\n\nAs I am yearning\n\nAnd meanwhile, a whole lot goes down\n\nSomewhere in the darkness, us together for a while\n\nYou loved it then, so did I\n\nA feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again\n\n\n\nNow don’t leave it there, just give it a chance\n\nIf only I’d forget you after one last dance\n\nBut you’re everywhere, yes you are\n\nIn every melody and in every little scar\n\nYes you are, you are, love\n\n\n\nHabibi, light is burning\n\nAs I am burning\n\nHabibi, light is burning\n\nAnd I am yearning"
