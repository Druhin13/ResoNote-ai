  "lyrics": "I gave birth to a thought, call it an idea\r\nAsked myself, what we really doing here\r\nI Don’t know\r\nDoes anybody really know?\r\nWe all made up of stars, so what's there to fear\r\nDon’t know the beginning or if the end is near\n\nWe don’t know\n\nDoes anybody really know?\n\n\n\nWho wants to be on the ground anymore when there’s so much in the sky\n\nWatching the world spinning out of control, it seems like we living to die\n\nWho wants to keep looking down at the floor, we should have our heads up high\n\nIf you think I’m out of line, to say what’s on my mind you should ask yourself why\n\n\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\n\n\nGave birth to a vibe, call it a new wave\n\nI let the past go, looking on to better days\n\nIf we grow, shouldn’t everybody grow?\n\nYou can join my tribe, it don’t cost a thing\n\nJust take the red pill and you’ll never be the same\n\nOnce you know, don’t be afraid to let it go\n\n\n\nOh, who wants to be on the ground anymore when there’s so much in the sky\n\nWatching the world spinning out of control, it seems like we living to die\n\nWho wants to keep looking down at the floor, we should have our heads up high\n\nIf you think I’m out of line, to say what’s on my mind You should ask yourself why\n\n\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\n\n\nDon’t do that, don’t say that\n\nY'all don’t want me to be free\n\n'Cause ya’ll be sleeping, but we daydreaming\n\nYou’re afraid of us\n\nDon’t feel bad, don’t look back\n\nWhy can't we just let it be\n\n'Cause y'all be watching and y'all keep talking\n\nSooner or later, you have to let go and breathe\n\n\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue\n\nYa ya ya ya ya ya ya\n\nI got my head up in the clouds again\n\nIt’s all blue"
