  "lyrics": "And are those real angels in the magazines?\r\nOh, is there a heaven? You'd know now you've been\r\nAre those real stars that hang in the sky?\r\nOr are they man made? A trick of the light?\r\nAmen, Amen\n\nAmen\n\n\n\nAnd is there a God up there? 'So, where does he hide?\n\n'Cause the devil is raging inside my mind\n\nAnd is there a moment where it all makes sense?\n\nWhen saying goodbye, doesn't feel like the end?\n\n\n\nAmen, Amen\n\nAmen\n\n\n\nSometimes I can't help blaming you\n\nFor leaving me here, what am I supposed to do?\n\nThere's plenty of women, there's drink and there's drugs\n\nBut we both know that won't be enough\n\n'Cause I see you in the daytime, and I hear you at night\n\nThere's a pale imitation burnt in my eyes\n\nI don't want to be here, I don't know what to do\n\nSometimes I'd rather be dead, at least then I'm with you\n\n\n\nAmen, Amen\n\nAmen, Amen\n\nAmen, Amen\n\nAmen, Amen\n\nAmen"
