  "lyrics": "It was 4 in the morning, tears down my face\r\nI chose to call it time\r\nI tried hard for you baby, no one else mattered\r\nI hope that we be fine\r\nAs I walk down the hallway, debris is falling, feels like the end of time\n\nI need to wash away the hours I cried last night\n\n\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to remove this lovers pain\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to come and fill me up again\n\n\n\nWere you scared when it went our way?\n\nDid it cross your mind I was just as broken\n\nYou remain underneath the dust\n\nNow the fairy words hasn't gone unspoken\n\nI just cry, I only loved once, you were my whole life\n\nNow you're confined to my darkest memory\n\n\n\nI need to wash away the hours I cried last night\n\n\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to remove this lovers pain\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to come and fill me up again\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to dissolve a lovers flame\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to make a woman of me again\n\n\n\nPour me a drink and bring it over here\n\nI don't want no ice, I'm already cold enough now\n\nIn our last days I would lie with you\n\nAnd you would never even sensed the end was coming\n\nI'm trying but it hurts like mad\n\nBaby what you doing now?\n\nActing like you don't even care that the world outside is broken down\n\nAnd my lungs have no air\n\n\n\nI cannot wait for the rain\n\nI cannot wait for the rain to make a woman of me again"
