  "lyrics": "Into the source of a squall\r\nI inevitably fall\r\nToward the well-spring of all agony\r\nShuffling endlessly\r\nWhether or not it was always going to be this way\r\nIt only mattered yesterday\n\n\n\nNo skin like the skin you woke up in\n\nNo skin like the skin you woke up in\n\n\n\nUp from the earth and the clay\n\nMelting away\n\nNever lose enough to find my form\n\nTrudge through the storm\n\nWait in hope\n\nFor some as yet undiscovered isotope\n\n\n\nNo skin like the skin you woke up in\n\nNo skin like the skin you woke up in\n\n\n\nWhen at last\n\nThe die gets cast\n\nRead the numbers out loud\n\nWith your head bowed\n\nTry to find a face to focus on\n\nBut the memory’s gone\n\nWherever my former self went\n\nIt was an accident\n\nTry to picture him in my mind’s eye\n\nSay goodbye\n\n\n\nNo skin like the skin you woke up in\n\nNo skin like the skin you woke up in"
