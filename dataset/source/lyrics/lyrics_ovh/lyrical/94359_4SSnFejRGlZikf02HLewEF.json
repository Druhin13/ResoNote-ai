Why do you care for me?\r\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?\n\n\n\nCome here\n\nSay it, spit it out, what is it exactly\n\nAre you payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out, am I satisfactory?\n\nToday, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly\n\nThe way I'm drinkin' you down\n\nLike I wanna drown, like I wanna end me\n\n\n\nStep on the glass, staple your tongue\n\nBury a friend, try to wake up\n\nCannibal class, killing the sun\n\nBury a friend, I wanna end me\n\n\n\nI wanna end me\n\nI wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me\n\nI wanna, I wanna, I wanna…\n\n\n\nWhat do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?\n\nWhat are you wondering? What do you know?\n\nWhy aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?\n\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?\n\n\n\nListen\n\nKeep you in the dark, what had you expected?\n\nMe to make you my art and make you a star\n\nAnd get you connected?\n\nI'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected\n\nBut we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart\n\n'Cause I'm too expensive\n\nYour talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud\n\nHonestly, I thought that I would be dead by now\n\nCalling security, keepin' my head held down\n\nBury the hatchet or bury your friend right now\n\n\n\nFor the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul\n\n'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no\n\nThen my limbs are froze and my eyes won't close\n\nAnd I can't say no, I can't say no\n\nCareful\n\n\n\nStep on the glass, staple your tongue\n\nBury a friend, try to wake up\n\nCannibal class, killing the sun\n\nBury a friend, I wanna end me\n\n\n\nI wanna end me\n\nI wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me\n\nI wanna, I wanna, I wanna…\n\n\n\nWhat do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?\n\nWhat are you wondering? What do you know?\n\nWhy aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?\n\nWhen we all fall asleep, where do we go?"
