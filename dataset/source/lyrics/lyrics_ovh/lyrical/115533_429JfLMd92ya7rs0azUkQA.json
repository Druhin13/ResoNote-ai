I'm a boss tycoon\nCoolest monkey in the jungle, not a baboon, ah\n\n[IDK]\nI'm goin' uptown with a smile and my tongue brown\nRollie in my name, Plain Jane, what's a bust down?\nNigga, I ain't on what you on, you a fuckin' fraud\nYou know that ain't love, not at all\nSee I could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now\nI could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now\nI could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now\nI could fuck the wave up, bitch, that ain't the wave now"
