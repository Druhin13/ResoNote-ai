  "lyrics": "He can't remember \nThe times that he thought\r\nDoes my daddy love me?\r\nProbably not\r\nThat didn't stop him\r\nFrom wishing that he did\n\nDidn't keep him from wanting\n\nOr worshipping him\n\n\n\nHe guesses he saw him\n\nAbout once a year\n\nHe could still feel the way he felt\n\nStanding in tears\n\nStretching his arms out\n\nAs far as they'd go\n\nWhispering dad\n\nI want you to know\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI love you this much \n\nAnd i'm waiting on you\n\nTo make up your mind\n\nDo you love me too?\n\nHow ever long it takes\n\nI'm never giving up no matter what\n\nI love you this much\n\n\n\nHe grew to hate him for what he had done\n\n'cause what kind of father\n\nCould do that to his son?\n\nHe said 'damn you daddy'\n\nThe day that he died\n\nThe man didn't blink\n\nBut the little boy cried\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI love you this much \n\nAnd i'm waiting on you\n\nTo make up your mind\n\nDo you love me too?\n\nHow ever long it takes\n\nI'm never giving up no matter what\n\nI love you this much\n\n\n\nHalf way through the service\n\nWhile the whoir sang a hymn\n\nHe looked up a the preacher\n\nAnd he sat and stared at him\n\n\n\nHe said\n\n'forgive me father' \n\nWhen he realized\n\nThat he hadn't been unloved\n\nOr alone all his life\n\nHis arms were stretched out \n\nAs far as they go\n\nNailed to the cross\n\nFor the whole world to know\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI love you this much \n\nAnd i'm waiting on you\n\nTo make up your mind\n\nDo you love me too?\n\nHow ever long it takes\n\nI'm never giving up no matter what\n\nI love you this much"
