  "lyrics": "In a cloud of dust, I picked you up off your front porch\r\nMy old truck was lifted\r\nThat summer dress messing with my head\r\nCaught the wind just a little bit and lifted\r\nAnd it sure felt good (it sure felt good)\r\nYou were holding my hand (you were holding my hand)\n\nLooking out over that hood (looking out over that hood)\n\nSinging John Mellencamp\n\n\n\nAnd we were high on nothing but living and loving\n\nRunning down something called a dirt road dream\n\nOur own little world, one boy, one girl\n\nSeventeen and riding that sweet southern breeze\n\nLifted, like a song from a choir\n\nLifted, like a flame from a raging fire\n\nLifted\n\n\n\nFirst kiss out under the stars\n\nI've kissed before but that ol' bar was lifted\n\nNew spot, we found my old guitar\n\nYou're dancing around with your arms lifted\n\nAnd you sang along like you'd never be gone\n\n\n\nAnd we were high on nothing but living and loving\n\nRunning down something called a dirt road dream\n\nOur own little world, one boy, one girl\n\nSeventeen and riding that sweet southern breeze\n\n\n\nLifted, like a prayer from a sinner\n\nLifted, checkered flag, finish line for the winner\n\nLifted\n\n\n\nAnd we were high on nothing but living and loving\n\nRunning down something called a dirt road dream\n\nOur own little world, one boy, one girl\n\nSeventeen and riding that sweet southern breeze\n\n\n\nLifted, like a sail in the wind\n\nLifted, girl let's go back again\n\nHeat Rises\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Jeff Hurd for these lyrics)"
