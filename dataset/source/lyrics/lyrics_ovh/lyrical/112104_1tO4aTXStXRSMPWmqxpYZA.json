  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Get Lost par Bearson\r\nDesert night, open eyes, I've been watching\nLooking back in the past, I do it often\nCalm the nerves, I'm a passenger\nWhen I should be driving\nSecond guess my every step is undecided\n\nTook another wrong turn again and found myself\n'Cause you could only see in the end\n\nThat you gonna get lost to find yourself\nKnow you gonna hold on for something else\n'Cause you got a life time to work it out\nSo you gonna get lost to find yourself\nTo find yourself\n\nA movie scene of your routine\n\nGo through the motions\nYou're there and back\nWith this and that\nBut never knowing\nWater in your glass\nYou think it's half, but it's an ocean\nThen finally you will see it's overflowing\n\nTook another wrong turn again and found yourself\n'Cause you could only see in the end\n\nThat you gonna get lost to find yourself\nKnow you gonna hold on for something else\n'Cause you got a life time to work it out\nSo you gonna get lost to find yourself\nTo find yourself"
