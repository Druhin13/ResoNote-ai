  "lyrics": "'Cause I was born a water baby\r\nSwimming with these times\r\nThe grooves that turn the grey to sunshine\r\n'Cause I will live through days that break me\r\nSwimming with these times\r\nThe grooves that turn the grey to sunshine\n\n\n\nI'm still tryna write the story as I see it\n\nThe trouble is when I say it, they don't believe it\n\nThey reckon I only say it but I don't mean it\n\nI'm tryna tell 'em I'd only say it if I can feel it\n\n'Cause money's tight, maybe tighter than it was before\n\nI'm helping out on a mortgage I really can't afford\n\nFamily breaking north, I cover the trips abroad\n\nShakin', I'm making another loss on another tour\n\nBut what I done it for?\n\nTo see my mother in the sun abroad\n\nI run into trouble, that was coming for her\n\nMy little brother got the hunger for\n\nAll the exact same pain\n\nThat makes the rain in my stomach pour\n\nSo let me paint it broader\n\nThis for any dude who's got a daughter\n\nLiving off lines that your papa taught her\n\nAin't got no time to be coming for you\n\nGo with the flow of this running water\n\n\n\nGo with the flow of this\n\nGo with the flow of this\n\nGo with the flow of this\n\n\n\nDon't you worry\n\nTwo leaves won't grow the same\n\nAnd people might forget your name\n\nDoesn't matter if they do\n\nDon't you hurry\n\nWhen the hot coffee pours will stain\n\nAnd when the Uber left you in the rain\n\nYour time will come around to you\n\nDespite the stress of spending so much time alone\n\n'Cause this ge-o-gra-phy is keeping me at home\n\nAnd I don't know the way to go\n\nI move with the flow of this running water, this running water\n\n\n\n'Cause I was born a water baby\n\nSwimming with these times\n\nThe grooves that turn the grey to sunshine\n\n'Cause I will live through days that break me\n\nSwimming with these times\n\nThe grooves that turn the grey to sunshine\n\n\n\nGo with the flow of this running water"
