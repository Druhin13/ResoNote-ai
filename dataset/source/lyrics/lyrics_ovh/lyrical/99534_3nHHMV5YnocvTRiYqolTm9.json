  "lyrics": "When you drink you show your teeth at me\r\nDoes it bring you peace to win so easily?\r\nAre you so in control?\r\nYou say you're weak\r\nYou say you need those bad habits\r\nThat help you sleep when all your dreams get mad at you\n\nAre you so in control? Then\n\n\n\nYou shatter like glass on the ceiling and\n\nYou never explain how you're feeling, no\n\nI'll find love for the both of us\n\nI'll pick all your pieces up\n\n\n\nIf you'll shed your skin and let me in in small measures\n\nI'll accept your innocence and guilty pleasures\n\nAnd all your flaws, then\n\n\n\nYou shatter like glass on the ceiling and\n\nYou never explain how you're feeling, no\n\nI'll find love for the both of us\n\nI'll pick all your pieces up\n\nI'll find love for the both of us\n\nI'll pick all your pieces up\n\n\n\nIf I can't break your fall\n\nSave you from yourself\n\nI will take you up, then\n\n\n\nYou shatter like the glass on the ceiling and\n\nYou never explain how you're feeling, no\n\nI'll find love for the both of us\n\nI'll pick all your pieces up\n\nI'll find love for the both of us\n\nI'll pick all your pieces up"
