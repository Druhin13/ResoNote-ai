  "title": "Has Ended",
  "lyrics": "I woke up in a city\r\nThe soldiers had come home\r\nThe ego it had ended\r\nHis loud mouth was gone\r\nThe witches all were singing\n\nAnd the water turned grey\n\nAnd the mirrors and the phones\n\nCaught flame, caught flame\n\n\n\nSaying we won’t make this mistake again\n\n\n\nThen the idiot was alone, was alone\n\nAnd the water, it forgave us\n\nAnd the fascists felt ashamed\n\nAt their dancing puppet king\n\n\n\nSaying we won’t make this mistake again"
