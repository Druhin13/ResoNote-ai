  "lyrics": "It's Christmas time and there's no need to be afraid\nAt Christmas time we let in light and banish shade\nAnd in our world of plenty we can spread our smile of joy\nThrow your arms around the world\nAt Christmas time\n\n\nBut say a prayer, pray for the other ones\n\nAt Christmas time, it's hard but while you're having fun\n\nThere's a world outside your window and it's a world of dread and fear\n\nWhere a kiss of love can kill you and there's death in every tear\n\nAnd the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom\n\nWell tonight we're reaching out and touching you\n\n\n\nBring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa\n\nA song of hope where there's no hope tonight\n\nWhy is comfort is to be feared\n\nWhy is touch is to be scared\n\nHow can they know it's Christmas time at all\n\n\n\nHere's to you\n\nRaise a glass to everyone\n\nAnd here's to them\n\nAnd all their years to come\n\nLet them know it's Christmas after all\n\n\n\nFeed the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nFeel the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nHeal the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nHeal the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nFeed the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nFeed the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nHeal the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again\n\nHeal the world\n\nLet them know it's Christmas time again"
