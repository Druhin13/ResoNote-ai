  "lyrics": "Uh\r\nGimme that\r\nGimme that \nWhen the streets get so empty and the sky turns a dark grey (Uh)\r\nAnd all you see are them flagpoles with no flags givin' a wave (Salute)\n\nNo sunshine in these empty streets just a bunch of empty space\n\nAnd that's when... and that's when... and that's when...\n\nThe world went to waste-waste (Yeah)\n\nThe world went to waste\n\nThe world went to waste-waste (Uh, yeah)\n\nYeah, the world went to waste\n\n\n\nThe television finds a difference, makes a conflict of interest\n\nMakin' all blacks look crazy and all the whites look incest\n\nAnd you know that's real shit, watch CNN for a week\n\nDon Lemon's a shit starter and a bitch for the mainstream\n\nYeah guns and killers, guns and killers\n\nWho we're fightin'? A tyrannical government 'cause their heads got bigger\n\nAnd people think I'm crazy 'cause I study conspiracy theories\n\nWhen they don't ask shit, and that don't even make sense to me\n\nThey consume and get used, the toxic shit on the news\n\nThe white guy did it, black guy shot over Lebron shoes\n\nGo ahead and point your finger in my face so I can break it\n\nTake my AR-15 to the city, pay me to start ragin'\n\nIs that really what you really think are my fuckin' intentions\n\nYeah, I know I'm a savage, but not related to Clintons\n\nThere's a lot of elites that should be locked away in a prison\n\nSo quit fightin' with each other you old half-steppin' idiots"
