  "lyrics": "Look what you have overcome to get here\r\nLook at the distance you've run\r\nThe doubt that you push down\r\nFear you have drawn out when they said that it couldn't be done\n\nIn your head\n\nIn your heart and\n\nIn your hands\n\n\n\nIn your head\n\nIn your heart and\n\nIn your hands\n\n\n\nIn your head\n\nIn your heart and\n\nIn your hands\n\n\n\nGravity is a fragile thing\n\nAll of the work that you left in your roads\n\nAll of the dreams and that all\n\nNow you can finally see them\n\nThey meet you at your destination\n\nNow that you have made it so far\n\n\n\nIn your head\n\nIn your heart and\n\nIn your hands\n\n\n\nIn your head\n\nIn your heart and\n\nIn your hands\n\n\n\nIn your head\n\nIn your heart and\n\nIn your hands\n\n\n\nGravity is a fragile thing\n\nIt don't define you\n\nGravity will help you, love you\n\n\n\nTell them to never let go\n\nThere is a beautiful valley below\n\nWhen you hold on so tightly to the dream\n\nGravity is just a fragile thing..."
