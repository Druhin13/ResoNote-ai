  "lyrics": "Oh, I could feel the change a comin’\r\nFelt it in the breeze\r\nOh, I could feel the change a comin’\r\nComin’ right for me\r\nOh, I could feel the change a comin’\r\nSaw it on TV\n\nOh, I could feel the change a comin’\n\nSaw it staring right on back at me\n\n\n\nOh, I could feel the shadow comin’\n\nStraight on down the line\n\nMasquerading like it was a friend of mine\n\nOh, I could feel the darkness wrappin’\n\nAll its arms in mine\n\nOh, I could feel the world was turnin’\n\nAll inside my mind\n\nOh, I could feel the world was turnin’\n\nAll inside, all inside my mind\n\n\n\nI knew it when it started\n\nFelt the shift right as it parted\n\nSaw my feet right down below me\n\nSaw the whole room move around me\n\nSaw my old life and my old friends\n\nSaw me haunted, saw me back again\n\n\n\nOh, maybe there’s a past life coming out inside of me\n\nMaybe it’s the song I’m singing’\n\nMaybe everything’s just turnin’\n\nOn how it should be\n\nMaybe there’s a past life comin’ out inside of me\n\nOh, maybe there’s a past life comin’ out inside, inside of me"
