  "lyrics": "Didn't know that the grass could be green like you\r\nDidn't see, I was falling so fast into\r\nOn the brink of giving up\r\nLike I balance on the edge of my mind\r\nWhen I wanna let it go and give into what I can't deny\n\nAre you breaking me down?\n\nI can't get around\n\nI can feel it is knocking me over inside\n\nRedefining my life in a blink of an eye\n\nI would give it all up if you stay with me now\n\n\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\n\n\nLike I'm losing my mind I can't sleep at night\n\nCan't hold back and you know, know what left you hide\n\nMillion voices in my head tell me, \"Listen to yourself and go\"\n\nAnd I'm fighting it within but I'm slowly giving up control\n\n\n\nAre you breaking me down?\n\nI can't get around\n\nI can feel it is knocking me over inside\n\nRedefining my life in a blink of an eye\n\nI would give it all up if you stay with me now\n\n\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\n\n\nHigh on you\n\nHigh on you\n\nIf it's all in my mind\n\nI'm never coming down\n\nI just wanna stay up in the sky\n\n\n\nAre you breaking me down?\n\nI can't get around\n\nI can feel it is knocking me over inside\n\nRedefining my life in a blink of an eye\n\nI would give it all up if you stay with me now\n\n\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\n\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you\n\nI'm high on you\n\nHigh on you"
