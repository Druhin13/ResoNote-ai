Kinda hot\n\nDon’t you let the time fly by\n\n\n\n(But you like) \"What if, in the end, this is the only life we get?\"\n\nI’m only invested 'cause I wanna live it big\n\nIf I would’ve known I would've been a better kid\n\nI swear to God\n\n\n\nEven with all odds against me, I\n\nSeem to find my way\n\nEven with the whole world against me, I\n\nI seem to find my way\n\nSwear to God (Yeah), oh"
