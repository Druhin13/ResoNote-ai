  "lyrics": "Felt so tired I couldn't keep up my eyes\r\nIn the dark bittersweet sleep but wake in mind\r\nA creature stepped out of the wall and then\r\nIn the blackness it amassed above my hand\r\nFelt it creeping from my head down to my feet\n\nThe creature let me know that it would be walking with me\n\n\n\n\n\nCouldn't move enough to reach and find a light\n\nTell my heart that it was only in my mind\n\n\n\nThe creature stepped out of the wall and then\n\nIn the blackness it amassed above my hand\n\nFelt it creeping from my head down to my feet\n\nThe creature let me know that it would be walking with me"
