Do you rap? Do you do anything? (Do you sing? Do you rap? Do you do anything?)\n\nAnd he was like well I wanna bring you to LA\n\nSo me I was like LA okay cool (Just trust me I'll make you a star)\n\nSo I went out there\n\nI met Meechie and I met um Adam's management partner dan (I got you that check Barb are we cool)\n\nAnd I stayed out there for a little bit\n\nI did some interviews\n\nAnd did some videos and stuff\n\nAnd then\n\nI went back to Florida\n\nAnd me and ZZ were just like walking like the streets\n\nWhere it's like going to the beach and stuff\n\nAnd people kept taking pictures of me\n\nAnd they kept like\n\nWe kept getting into fights\n\nAnd like even some of ZZ’s friends got into fights about me\n\nAnd I was getting sued for it I was getting blamed for it\n\nSo I then I hired my body guard Frank (hey I'm Frank)\n\nBecause he a big ass muhfucker\n\nAnd he'll beat up everybody and they mama (Just go fuck yourself)\n\nSo me and ZZ had went somewhere with one of her friends\n\nAnd we ended up getting tattoos that night\n\nAnd I didn't tell Adam I was gonna do it\n\nBecause I didn't think he would care like\n\nI didn't think he really like gave a fuck\n\nSo I ended up getting a tattoo\n\nThe tattoo I have on my arm (It says family first)\n\nAnd I went home\n\nAnd Adam had called me and he\n\nOr he FaceTimed me and he seen it\n\nAnd he was like oh my god\n\nYour going to fucking\n\nYou're you're you're going back to LA\n\nI can't have you out here doing this shit (I can't have you out here doing this shit)\n\nLike you're going to fuck yourself\n\nYou're going to get in trouble\n\nThis is not happening anymore\n\nSo before he had sent me back to LA\n\nThat day I met this girl Gabby\n\nWho I then started dating or talking to for a couple months (I don't know why.. I really don't know why)\n\nAnd I was living with her in her trailer\n\nAnd it was crazy like every time I'd go outside\n\nLike there was all the neighborhood kids were surrounding like her house (Everyone wanted to see me and take pictures)\n\nAnd meanwhile while my dad was trying to get back in my life\n\nAnd I didn't understand why\n\nSo I told him like no I don't want you to be in my life\n\nLike 14 years and you haven't been here\n\nNow all of a sudden\n\nYou see I have fans and followers and all this\n\nAnd now you wanna get back in my life like no\n\nIt's not gonna work that way (Nope)\n\nHe didn't like that so he went to press\n\nHe went to other cops (Everywhere you could imagine)\n\nHe went to news stations\n\nAnd other TV hosts and all this shit\n\nFacebook, Instagram, twitter (Dumbass)\n\nTalking all the shit he possibly could\n\nJust trying to sabotage my whole career that wasn't a career yet (He just wanted money he just wanted his voice to be heard)\n\nHe wanted to make sure that every time I went to court\n\nHe went as well and tried to fuck shit up\n\nHe lied to the judge\n\nTold the judge I was suicidal\n\nTold the judge I needed sexual ed classes\n\nLike just a bunch of unnecessary bullshit\n\nSo fast forward fuck my dad (Fuck his bitch pussy ass)\n\nThen my manager was like okay let's go to this recording studio\n\nI have a few people I want you to meet\n\nSo I went there, I met this A&R Aton (What's good Bhad Bhabie)\n\nAnd he was like well we have this song\n\nLike we want you to record it\n\nWe want to see how you sound (We gotta try this out, lets try this)\n\nAnd it was just literally just\n\nHi Bich\n\nHi Bich\n\nHi Bich\n\nIt was not no other (it's just a hook right now but we'll work on this)\n\nNo other lyrics\n\nIt was just a beat and the words \"Hi Bich\"\n\nSo we made some verses and finished the hook (Yo Aton this shit is fire)\n\nAnd Aton loved the song (Dan, Adam, Mike Caren call the lawyers)\n\nAnd he was like you know what\n\nYou're gold\n\nI wanna sign you"
