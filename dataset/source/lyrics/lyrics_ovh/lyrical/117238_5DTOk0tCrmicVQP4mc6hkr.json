'Cause we carry a gun\n\nAnd every nigga in my neighborhood carryin' one\n\n'Cause we had nightmares of our mamas got to bury her son\n\nI'm speakin' to you as a prophet as rare as they come, uh\n\nGunshots sound like music hangin' out the Buick\n\nWhy you wanna be a shooter?\n\nMama told me not to do it but I did it\n\nNow I'm locked up in a prison\n\nCallin' mama like I shouldn't have did it\n\nWatch my dream shatter in an instant\n\nI'm on a visit posin' for the picture\n\nLike I'm going for my prom or somethin'\n\nLike I ain't facing time or somethin'\n\nRide for these niggas like that shit ain't hurt my mom or somethin'\n\nOnly one gon' get me commissary or even buy me somethin'\n\nWhen it all fall down\n\nI can call y'all now\n\nEven if I hit your phone\n\nThat won't get me home\n\nSeen so many different times , these niggas did me wrong\n\nShit that's the reason that I did this song\n\n\n\nShit we was kids used to play on the step\n\nA couple years later we flirtin' with the angel of death\n\nI was eleven years old, I got my hands on the Tec\n\nWhen I first touched it that shit gave me a rash\n\nMy homie's dying I'm like \"Maybe we next\"\n\nThat just made me a threat\n\nKnowin' the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset\n\nMade me a man shit I was five when God gave me my test\n\nGo to court with a court apointed and he won't say object\n\nNow it's you against the state and you ain't got no cake\n\nJail overpopulated they ain't got no space\n\nI know a youngin' that got murked ain't get to drive no Wraith\n\nBut he in hearse on the way to church, I know his mom gon' faint\n\nWhen she smell like embalment fluid, cologne all on her baby\n\nPastor said he sendin' you home, she goin' crazy\n\nWhen they drop that casket all in the ground, who gon' save me?\n\nHow could you blame me? When I'm tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twenty-five\n\nWhen I stop fearin' for my life, when I decide to change my mind And stop tokin'\n\nTryna smoke the pain away, they lock us up for smokey\n\nPut 'em on probation, lock you up if you ain't perfect\n\nVictims of the system like a rain drop in the ocean\n\nThey closin' all the schools and all the prisons gettin' open\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nSee comin' from where I come from\n\nWe had to beat the streets\n\nBeat the system, beat racism, beat poverty\n\nAnd now we made it through all that we at the championship"
