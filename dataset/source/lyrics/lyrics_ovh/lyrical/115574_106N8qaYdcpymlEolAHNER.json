  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Another One Of Those Days par Cavetown\r\nCycling down town\nThought the fresh air would pick me up\nUp-up and away from the ground\nBut there’s no talking dog up here\nBlowin' up balloons with my dear\n\nHoped maybe I’d see a familiar face on my way\nPassed by some cannabis seeds, it all smells exactly the same\nI saw a girl in my dreams but I don’t remember her name\nI guess it’s just another one of those days\nWhen I’m missin' everythin'\n\nCarousel round and round\nLike a kid’s toy, you wind me up\n\nAnd I’ve got nothing to say\nSo you just throw me in the dump truck\nHopin' round the corner I’ll see her\n\nPassed that kid from chemistry who made fun of my name\nHe didn’t look very happy, I guess we all turn out the same\nI saw a girl in my dreams, she kissed me on the face\nI guess it’s just another one of those days\nWhen I’m missin' everythin'\n\nWhen she shows up, she can sit on my shoulders\n'Cause I’m so strong...I wish\nPiggy-back-ride to the hill, then we roll down\nFeelin' like kids for the rest of our lives\n\n\nHopin' in the mornin' I’ll meet her\n\nBut for now I’ll just be lonely, and my arms will feel so bare\nDreamin' ‘bout her body round me, with my fingers in her hair\nIt might be so easy, but I am just too scared\n'Cause I saw a girl in my dreams, but she doesn’t like me\n\nI saw a girl in my dream"
