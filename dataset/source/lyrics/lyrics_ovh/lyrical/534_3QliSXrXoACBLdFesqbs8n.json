  "lyrics": "Can't you see I'm shaking in my shoes\nI've done everything but I still got the blues\nEverywhere I turn there's misery\nStuck in the middle of nowhere street\n\nGo away come back where ya goin'\n\nDon't do that, do this, don't you blow it\n\nRun don't walk, shout don't talk about it\n\nYou don't know anything about it\n\n\n\nIt's no good there's no way out\n\nNo way out\n\nA fine affair and there's no doubt\n\nThere's no doubt\n\nThat there's no way out, no way out\n\n\n\nShe left some money in a paper sack\n\nAnd a note to say she ain't coming back\n\nIt's no good there's no way out\n\nA fine affair and there's no doubt\n\nBut there's no way out, no way out\n\n\n\nThey're coming at me from everywhere\n\nThey say she's already gone from here\n\n\n\nGo away come back where ya goin'\n\nDon't do that, do this, don't you blow it\n\nRun don't walk, shout don't talk about it\n\nYou don't know anything about it\n\n\n\nIt's no good there's no way out\n\nNo way out\n\nA fine affair and there's no doubt\n\nThat there's no way out, no way out\n\n\n\nNo way out\n\nNo way out\n\nNo way out\n\nNo way out"
