  "lyrics": "We were worlds apart\r\nSo I fell from the stars\r\nI travelled long and I travelled far\r\nThen deep in the dark\r\nI followed a spark\r\nAnd it led straight to your heart\n\n\n\nThere'll be oceans for us to tread\n\nThere'll be bridges for us to mend\n\nBut I'll stick through it\n\nOh, I swear\n\nThere'll be mountains for us to climb\n\nThere'll be days when the sun won't shine\n\nBut I'll stick to it\n\nOh, I swear\n\n\n\nI've got scars by great white sharks\n\nBut I swam fast and I swam hard\n\nAll these miles I've walked\n\nAll these stumbles and falls\n\nThey led me straight to your arms\n\n\n\nBut there'll be oceans for us to tread\n\nThere'll be bridges for us to mend\n\nBut I'll stick through it\n\nOh, I swear\n\nThere'll be mountains for us to climb\n\nThere'll be days when the sun won't shine\n\nBut I'll stick to it\n\nOh, I swear\n\nOh, I swear"
