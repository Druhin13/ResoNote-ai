  "lyrics": "And now you want me to breathe\r\nAnd be so grateful\r\nAhhhhh, for the air that I need (haha)\r\nDon't make me pitiful\r\nAnd in the morning light\n\nWe're just the same you and me\n\nOut on the go, send officials\n\nOur propensity to breed\n\n\n\nThe higher, the farther, the faster you fly\n\nYou may be rich, but you can't deny me\n\nGot nothing, got nothing but the will to survive\n\nYou can't control, and you can't deny me\n\n\n\nYour lies are sick\n\nThey're sick and they're vile\n\nYou can't deny me\n\n\n\nTry and talk down to me\n\nMy mind it ain't so simple\n\nWhere's your vocabulary\n\nYour ignorance is sinful\n\n\n\nYou plant your lying seeds\n\nWatch as the roots take hold\n\nThe country you are now poisoning\n\nCondition critical\n\n\n\nThe higher, the farther, the faster you fly\n\nI know it's true, and you can't deny me\n\nGot nothing, got nothing, you got nothing to hide\n\nLittle bullshit whore, and you can't deny me\n\n\n\nThe higher, the farther, the faster you fly\n\nIt's all so sick, and you can't deny me\n\n\n\nYou can't deny me\n\nYou can't deny me\n\nYou don't defy me\n\nYou can't deny me\n\n\n\nThe higher, the farther, the faster you fly\n\nYou know you're sick, and you can't deny me\n\nGot nothing, just nothing, got something to hide\n\nWe see right through you, and you can't deny me\n\n\n\nDarkness, darkness, darkness and light\n\nYou can't deny me"
