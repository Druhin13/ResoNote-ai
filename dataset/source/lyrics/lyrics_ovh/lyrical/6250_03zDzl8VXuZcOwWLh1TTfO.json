  "lyrics": "I know a secret spot just for us (just for us)\r\nWhere you can see the city perfectly (perfectly)\r\nWe don't have to do drugs, kiss, or touch (kiss or touch)\r\nBut if you want to, that works for me (works for me)\r\nWe can both pretend it's the first time (first time)\r\nLike we don't know what heartbreak feels like (feels like)\n\nLike we ain't ever watched everything we love burn to the ground\n\nYeah, that'd be real nice\n\nLook at the lights\n\nI wonder if anyone sees us from all the way out there\n\nProbably not\n\nSo, whatchu waitin' on?\n\nGo ahead, let it out now, I ain't scared\n\nI got demons too, if you even knew\n\nProbably the only reason I believe in you\n\nI know what they look like\n\nAnd you've got the look like you've got somethin'\n\n\n\nStuck inside\n\nThey slicin' up your heart like pumpkin pie\n\nIt must be scrumptious, everyone just wants to try\n\nUntil there's nothing left, and yet they wonder why\n\nYou run and hide (there's somethin' eating you alive)\n\n'Cause there's somethin' eating you alive\n\nAlive\n\n'Cause there's somethin' eating you alive\n\n\n\nIt's in the eyes, it's in the eyes\n\nEven through a mask, they cannot be disguised\n\nThey are windows into your insides\n\nAnd they say you haven't really been fine\n\nHere's an idea to bring us in tighter\n\nI'm sick of being empty, you sick of being tired\n\nI wanna feel warmer, you wanna see a fire\n\nI'm soaked in gasoline, youâ€”go head and drop the lighter\n\nNow, here's a chance baby\n\nI'm sittin' right beside ya\n\nYou cannot hold me down, but I like the way you try to\n\nSo push a little harder, squeeze a little tighter\n\nIt drives me crazy the way you let the crazy drive you\n\nI see me and you, you see you and me\n\nI say we pretend this is just a lucid dream\n\n'Cause you deserve a good night\n\n'Cause you've got the look like you've got somethin'\n\n\n\nStuck inside\n\nThey slicin' up your heart like pumpkin pie\n\nIt must be scrumptious, everyone just wants to try\n\nUntil there's nothing left, and yet they wonder why\n\nYou run and hide (there's somethin' eating you alive)\n\n'Cause there's somethin' eating you alive\n\nAlive\n\n'Cause there's somethin' eating you alive"
