  "lyrics": "So be it, I’m your crowbar\r\nIf that’s what I am so far\r\nUntil you get out of this mess\r\nAnd I will pretend\r\nThat I don’t know of your sins\r\nUntil you are ready to confess\n\nBut all the time, all the time\n\nI’ll know, I’ll know\n\n\n\nAnd you can use my skin\n\nTo bury secrets in\n\nAnd I will settle you down\n\nAnd at my own suggestion\n\nI will ask no questions\n\nWhile I do my thing in the background\n\nBut all the time, all the time\n\nI’ll know, I’ll know\n\n\n\nBaby\n\nI can't help you out\n\nWhile she is still around\n\n\n\nSo for the time being, I'm being patient\n\nAnd amidst this bitterness\n\nIf you'll just consider this\n\nEven if it don’t make sense all the time\n\nGive it time\n\nAnd when the crowd becomes your burden\n\nAnd you've early closed your curtain\n\nI'll wait by the backstage door\n\n\n\nWhile you try to find\n\nThe lines to speak your mind\n\nAnd pry it open, hoping for an encore\n\nAnd if it gets too late, for me to wait\n\nFor you to find you love me, and tell me so\n\nIt’s ok, don’t need to say it"
