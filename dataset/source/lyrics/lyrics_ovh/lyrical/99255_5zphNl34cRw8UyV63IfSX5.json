  "lyrics": "Don't think I need to say this\r\n'Cause you know what's in my head\r\n\"Fucked up\" is an understatement\r\nCan't wait for this year to end\r\nIt all fell apart, don't know where to start\n\nEverything moves so slow\n\nI can't get a break, it's too much to take\n\nBut closing my eyes I know\n\n\n\nWhen the world's on fire, all I need is you\n\nI don't always think to say it but it's true\n\nWhen I just wanna disappear, you're the one who keeps me here\n\nThe world's on fire, all I need is you\n\n\n\nThe riot's on the horizon, calling each others' bluff\n\nThe smoke's filling up the skies, say we should back it up\n\nMaybe the blaze will take this away, I shine the earth below\n\nTell me to breathe, you still believe closing my eyes I know\n\n\n\nWhen the world's on fire, all I need is you\n\nI don't always think to say it but it's true\n\nWhen I just wanna disappear, you're the one who keeps me here\n\nThe world's on fire, all I need is you\n\n\n\nWhen the world's on fire, all I need is you\n\nI don't always think to say it but it's true\n\nWhen I just wanna disappear, you're the one who keeps me here\n\nThe world's on fire, all I need is you\n\n\n\nThe world's on fire, all I need is you\n\nThe world's on fire, all I need is you"
