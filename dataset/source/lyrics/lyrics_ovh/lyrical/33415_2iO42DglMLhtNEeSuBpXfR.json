Yeah!\r\nYou broke the power of canceled sin\r\nYou brought this child back home again\r\nI am free, how can it be?\n\n\n\nOh, for a thousand tongues to sing\n\nMy great Redeemer's praise\n\nThe glories of my God and King\n\nThe triumphs of Your grace\n\n\n\nYou crushed the darkness with Your love\n\nYou washed me white in crimson flood\n\nI am free, how can it be? Oh\n\nI am free, how can it be?\n\n\n\nOh, for a thousand tongues to sing\n\nMy great Redeemer's praise\n\nThe glories of my God and King\n\nThe triumphs of Your grace\n\n\n\nYou triumphed over my every mistake\n\nOver the depths of my shame\n\nOver the prison of fear\n\nYou have the victory here\n\nOver the sting of the grave\n\nYou are faithful and mighty to save\n\nLet all that's within me proclaim\n\nYour power, Your greatness, Your name!\n\n\n\nOh, for a thousand tongues to sing\n\nMy great Redeemer's praise\n\nThe glories of my God and King\n\nThe triumphs of Your grace\n\nOh, for a thousand tongues to sing\n\nMy great Redeemer's praise\n\nThe glories of my God and King\n\nThe triumphs of Your grace!\n\n\n\nWoah-oh-ooh\n\nThe triumphs of Your grace!\n\nWoah-oh-ooooh"
