  "lyrics": "If I had a hundred wishes\r\nAnd only one of them could come true\r\nI would wish that over this distance\r\nI could be right there now with you\r\nCould we be in France again\n\nDance beneath the olive trees\n\nMingling bodies on a deserted beach\n\nMoon above to catch the breeze\n\n\n\nIn the night I see you still\n\nDarken hair and tender smile\n\nLeaning out of the window sill\n\nClutching roses on the while\n\n\n\nCould we be in Spain again\n\nDance beneath the olive trees\n\nMingling bodies on a deserted beach\n\nMoon above to catch the breeze\n\n\n\nIf I had a hundred wishes\n\nOnly one of them could come true\n\nI would wish that over this distance\n\nI could be right there now with you\n\n\n\nDo you remember the Summer grand\n\nWe took to the coast of Clare\n\nHear the ocean warm the rocks\n\nListened to the music there\n\n\n\nCould we be in Ireland again\n\nDance beneath the Oak trees\n\nMingling bodies on a deserted beach\n\nMoon above to catch the breeze\n\n\n\nIf I had a hundred wishes\n\nOnly one of them could come true\n\nI would wish that over this distance\n\nI could be right there now with you"
