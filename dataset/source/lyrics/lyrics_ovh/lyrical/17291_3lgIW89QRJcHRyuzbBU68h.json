  "lyrics": "Bought you a drink and we chatted by the bar\r\nTook me by surprise when you wanted to dance\r\nNothing I could fear when I'm in your arms\r\nBaby, tell me what you want\r\nWalked to the car and I felt something good\r\nThe wind blew up and I knew that you would\n\nBlow my mind if you felt you could\n\nAsk me if I wanted to, I think that we should\n\n\n\nAnd I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk\n\nI probably should go home\n\nBut I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk\n\nI can't leave you alone\n\n\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\n\n\nWhen I get in my head, I wonder where it'll go\n\nWill we break up? End up alone?\n\nI wonder if you feel the same\n\nNever wanted to complain\n\nI look in my heart and I still don't know\n\nWe take the risk 'cause we can't be sure\n\nIt's worth it for tonight\n\n'Cause I feel alright when I'm with you\n\n\n\nAnd I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk\n\nI probably should go home\n\nBut I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk\n\nI can't leave you alone\n\n\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\n\n\nHung up, hung up\n\nI feel it in my microphone\n\nHung up, hung up\n\n(And I'm so hung up, I'm pretty drunk)\n\nI feel it in my microphone\n\n\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark\n\nKiss me in the karaoke bar\n\nI need something, I feel so dark"
