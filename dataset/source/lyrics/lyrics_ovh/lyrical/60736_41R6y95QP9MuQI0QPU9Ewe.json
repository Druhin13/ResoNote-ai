  "lyrics": "And I don't wanna go to your funeral, I'd rather die first\r\nBut I don't want you to see me die so I don't know which one is worse\r\nIt's like the lesser of two evils, I know these days are evil\r\nSo I pray the Lord will guard me from the evil one, he's schemin'\r\nI've seen friends turn their back on the Lord\r\nIt weighs heavy on my shoulders yet I know the story isn't over\n\nSo I'm hoping for the best and keeping my mind sober\n\nWhen my phone rings, I get the voice of somebody that's broken\n\nAnd I wanna say I told ya, now it's too late to listen\n\nRunning in circles with friends who struggle with addiction\n\nCaught in a spider's web, this life is but a vapor\n\nAnd lust is like a viper waiting in the grass to strike ya\n\nI was called to give my life instead of keep it\n\nGotta leave behind my sin if I wanna follow Jesus\n\nIn our weakness is where the gospel meets us\n\nThe beauty of redemption revealed in broken pieces\n\n\n\nShadows cross right over me, right through me\n\nAnd my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly\n\nBut you go to the barrack of my inmost being\n\nSowing seeds of gratefulness you'll see me\n\n\n\nGod is my rest but lately I'm losing sleep\n\nThe good Shepherd never loses track of his sheep\n\nThat's a good thought to ponder when I see so many wander\n\nOff road, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under\n\nWhen I'm overwhelmed, I know I'm in over my head\n\nFighting with myself but my opponent is dead\n\nHow can we win the battle when we burn deeply within?\n\nJesus laid down his rights, I can lay down my sin\n\nIf He is Lord, all that competes with him loses\n\nOnly he completes me and cuts through the confusion\n\nOf my wants and my needs, my desires and my dreams\n\nHis love inspires me to lift my thoughts to higher things\n\nI was called to give my life instead of keep it\n\nThere's nothing worth keeping if it's keeping us from Jesus\n\nIn our weakness is where the gospel meets us\n\nThe beauty of redemption revealed in broken pieces\n\n\n\nShadows cross right over me, right through me\n\nAnd my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly\n\nBut you go to the barrack of my inmost being\n\nSowing seeds of gratefulness you'll see me\n\nShadows cross right over me, right through me\n\nAnd my thankfulness for this life is busted up certainly\n\nBut you go to the barrack of my inmost being\n\nSowing seeds of gratefulness despite my feelings"
