  "lyrics": "If I told you how I'm feeling, would you care?\r\nSixteen sneaking out with you, I swear\r\nHigh school never felt so bittersweet\r\nBut I know that this ain't gonna last a year\r\nStolen liquor in my system\n\nMeet me by the lake, do you miss me, boy?\n\nWill you listen, boy? Or just kiss me, boy?\n\nAct like you don't know how this gonna go\n\nAct like you don't know how this gonna go\n\n\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nSo just tell me\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nDon't act like you don't know where this gonna go\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nSo just tell me\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nDon't act like you don't know where this gonna go\n\n\n\nYou broke my heart right at the start of eighteen\n\nBut if I'm being honest, I don't care\n\nAll my friends they hate you\n\nWish I could forget you\n\nGet me in my feelings because you can\n\n\n\nStolen liquor, in my system\n\nMeet me by the lake, do you miss me, boy?\n\nWill you listen, boy? Or just kiss me, boy?\n\nAct like you don't know where this gonna go\n\nAct like you don't know where this gonna go\n\n\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nSo just tell me\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nDon't act like you don't know where this gonna go\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nSo just tell me\n\nBabe, I want you\n\nDon't act like you don't know where this gonna go"
