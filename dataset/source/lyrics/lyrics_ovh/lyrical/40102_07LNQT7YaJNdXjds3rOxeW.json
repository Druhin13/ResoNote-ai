  "title": "(We Were) Foolish Like the Flowers",
  "lyrics": "The warm of wanting you\r\nwas just too much to even mention.\r\nWashed in pale blues,\r\nyour touch it harmonized with deep magentas.\r\nIt's so sad when lovers they must leave.\r\nIt's so sad I believe.\n\nNow I'm glad, happy just to be.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nWe were foolish like the flowers\n\nto think a love like that, it could be ours.\n\n\n\nIt was so nice, you smiled and said\n\nit felt like summer wine.\n\nLike paradise lost, you said you'd go\n\nyour way I must go mine.\n\nFor every rainbow was one that had to end\n\ntry and catch it if you can.\n\nNot being strangers, yet still not being friends.\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nWas it the breeze perfumed,\n\na wind of no tomorrow,\n\nsailing free, lost high\n\nabove out seas of sorrow?\n\nFalling together was such a natural thing to do,\n\nfloating free in the loveliness of you,\n\nliving each moment like I never knew.\n\n\n\nChorus"
