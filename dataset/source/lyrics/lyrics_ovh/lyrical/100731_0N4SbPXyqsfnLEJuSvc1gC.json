Ha!\n\nWhy don't you ask your family why you're working like a dog\n\nWho thinks he's getting paid in credit at the butcher shop\n\nOr you could ask the queen of the ones who got away\n\nWho can't remember why she chose your rival by the way\n\nMaybe you've already dug yourself too deep a hole\n\nMining for the pretty things that satisfy your soul\n\nA soul it sounds like I'll be getting for a song\n\nI hope you're ready, you better hope I'm wrong\n\nYes, I might be\""
