  "lyrics": "You told yourself I'd write a letter today\r\nTell the world that you would hurt yourself\r\nCan't look in the mirror, much less anyone else\r\nYou try to move on from here\r\nBut you look like a ghost, daylight\r\nYou can't think, always running in place\n\nA lost soul that won't show his face\n\n\n\nBut I know\n\nYou're just someone who's feeling all alone\n\nYou're just someone who doesn't seem to know\n\nWhich way to turn\n\nIf you just ask for help\n\nIf you just ask for help\n\nFirst thing I'll say\n\nIs you gotta love yourself\n\n\n\nFind it hard to take\n\nHard to take even the best of praise\n\nA pair of hands that became too tough\n\nA growing armor for whatever they might touch\n\n\n\nBut I know\n\nYou're just someone who's feeling all alone\n\nYou're just someone who doesn't seem to know\n\nWhich way to turn\n\nIf you just ask for help\n\nIf you just ask for help\n\nFirst thing I'll say\n\nIs you gotta love yourself\n\n\n\nBut I know\n\nYou're just someone who's feeling all alone\n\nYou're just someone who doesn't seem to know\n\nWhich way to turn\n\nIf you just ask for help\n\nIf you just ask for help\n\nFirst thing I'll say\n\nIs you gotta love yourself\n\nYou gotta love yourself\n\nYou gotta love yourself"
