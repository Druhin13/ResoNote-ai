Yes it is that easy\n\nBut doesnt seem worth it\n\nIf the capital is co-con(spiracy )\n\n\n\nI cry your crazy\n\nIt's too crowded for me but\n\nI lie on your lazy\n\nForce is not the way too\n\n\n\nDoesn’t mean less when you make that sound\n\nCome at me best when you spread shit round\n\nOnly works well when you ponder spontaneity\n\nThere’s nothing really worse than being held as a traitor\n\nIf I wasn't true then I think I would be fake (ah)\n\nAnd you'd count the time I really wouldn't wait (ah)\n\n\n\nYou think I learnt the wrong lesson\n\nBut you don’t know that i'm constantly testing myself\n\nAnd no I count my own blessings\n\nBut if it bothers you then i'll make it seem messy\n\n\n\nI cry your crazy\n\nIt's too crowded for me but\n\nI lie on your lazy\n\nForce is not the way too\n\n\n\nDoesn’t mean less when you make that sound\n\nCome at me best when you spread shit round\n\nOnly works well when you ponder spontaneity\n\nThere’s nothing really worse than being held as a traitor\n\nIf I wasn't true then I think I would be fake (ah)\n\nAnd you'd count the time I really wouldn't wait (ah)\n\n\n\nCount the times I\n\nBreathe your own line\n\nCry fire while your down down\n\nAnd i thought the line\n\nSent to bleed the time dry\n\nI assume we’re not high\n\n\n\nDoesn’t mean less when you make that sound\n\nCome at me best when you spread shit round\n\nOnly works well when you ponder spontaneity\n\nThere’s nothing really worse than being held as a traitor\n\nIf I wasn't true then I think I would be fake (ah)\n\nAnd you'd count the time I really wouldn't wait (ah)\n\n\n\nYou count the times I really really wouldn't wait for you (Ah ah oh)\n\nYou count the times I really really wouldn't\n\nYou count the times I really really wouldn't wait for you (Ah ah oh)\n\nI count the times I count the times"
