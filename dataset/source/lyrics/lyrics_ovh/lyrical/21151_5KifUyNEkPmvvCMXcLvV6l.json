Or someone else entirely?\n\n\n\nAnd do I ever find love?\n\nDo I ever find love?\n\nDo I ever find love?\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\n\n\nIn the midst of sleep\n\nPictures come to me\n\nMemories and Dreams\n\nThings lost and might have beens\n\nIf you'd broke my heart\n\nVery near the start\n\nDo I sink alone like a stone?\n\n\n\nAm I Queen?\n\nA Majesterial has been\n\nI'm on fire\n\nA head full of desire\n\nThis is me\n\nI'm someone else entirely\n\n\n\nAnd do I ever find love?\n\nDo I ever find love?\n\nDo I ever find love?\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\n\n\nAm I Queen?\n\nOr something else I might have been?\n\nA star?\n\nPropping up the backstage bar\n\nIs that me? Or someone else entirely?\n\n\n\nAnd do I ever find love?\n\nDo I ever find love?\n\nDo I ever find love?\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\n\n\nAm I Queen?\n\nOr something else I might have been?\n\nA star?\n\nBackseat of a blacked out car\n\nIs that me?\n\n\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\nOr am I still waiting?\n\nAm I still waiting?\n\nOr am I still waiting?"
