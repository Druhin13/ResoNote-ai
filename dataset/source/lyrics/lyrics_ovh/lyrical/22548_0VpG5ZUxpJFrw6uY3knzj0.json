  "lyrics": "Reforged in the furnace of death\r\nWeaves fates in the warp and the weft\r\nDimensional rifts quake in the skies\r\nOn worlds born and razed in a blink of your mortal eyes\r\nMaster, born of the plasma\r\nSiphoning strength from the black twisting nether\n\nA rapture that fractures the cosmos\n\nTorn from the womb of primordial chaos\n\n\n\nRhaexorog come forth\n\nHordes of iron must be wrought\n\nMolten shells of steel ablaze\n\nCast in slime and living flame\n\n\n\nBathe the abyss in cosmic afterbirth\n\nHe shall arise to reclaim the multiverse\n\nIn noxious sanctums beyond the walls that keep\n\nThe cursed sleepers from the beast\n\n\n\nFeel the blessed touch of the unmaker\n\nInto this verdant nightmare you slip farther\n\nStalked and hounded in this dream forever\n\nSport for the beasts of Ankath-Shol\n\n\n\nWallow hopeless under starless nights\n\n\n\nYearn for the return of the creator's flame\n\nGaze out from the horizon and behold the sundering\n\n\n\nDark blood coursing through our mortal veins\n\nWe are unstoppable\n\nInfused with arcane power; the boon of Lord Yeth'Shuul\n\n\n\nPandemonium; a war in heaven, cataclysmic copulation\n\nTransdimensional astral tentacles\n\nMost irreverent fornication\n\n\n\nThe wheel spins once again\n\nCyclical time, no beginning or end\n\nSubject to no known law of nature\n\nIn wormholes entangled that hang in the ether\n\nScatter the remnants hereafter\n\nBlacken the stars with the power of the atom\n\nWe will shatter the order of aeons\n\nUnleashing his infinite legion of scions"
