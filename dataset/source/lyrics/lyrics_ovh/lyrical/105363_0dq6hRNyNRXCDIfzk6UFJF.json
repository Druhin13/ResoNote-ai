  "lyrics": "I used to dream I was a poster in a bedroom\r\nOr the pictures that get cut out of the fancy magazines\r\nSome tortured genius went to leave the planet too soon\r\nLivin' on champagne in the back of limousines\r\nTryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why\n\nTryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies\n\n\n\nTradin' where I'm at for some future destination\n\nWorkin' for attention I'll eventually resent\n\nTyrin' to ignore some of the darker implications\n\nOf smilin' for the camera with my hands in wet cement\n\n\n\nTryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why\n\nTryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies\n\nTryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why\n\nTryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies\n\n\n\nThere's someone in my reflection that's been hauntin' me my whole life\n\nThere's a world outside my window I can barely even hear\n\nAnd I wonder to myself as I am straightenin' my bowtie\n\nHow could I look so perfect on the screen and so awful in the mirror?\n\n\n\nTryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why\n\nTryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies\n\nTryin' to feed the fire without really knowin' why\n\nTryin' to feed the fire while hopin' that it dies\n\nHopin' that it dies\n\nHopin' that it dies\n\nHopin' that it dies"
