  "lyrics": "And now, the end is near\r\nAnd so I face the final curtain\r\nMy friend, I'll say it clear\r\nI'll state my case, of which I'm certain\r\nI've lived a life that's full\r\nI traveled each and every highway\n\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\n\n\n\nRegrets, I've had a few\n\nBut then again, too few to mention\n\nI did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption\n\nI planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway\n\nAnd more, much more than this, I did it my way\n\n\n\nYes, there were times, I'm sure you knew\n\nWhen I bit off more than I could chew\n\nBut through it all, when there was doubt\n\nI ate it up and spit it out\n\nI faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way\n\n\n\nI've loved, I've laughed and cried\n\nI've had my fill, my share of losing\n\nAnd now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing\n\nTo think I did all that\n\nAnd may I say, not in a shy way\n\nOh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way\n\n\n\nFor what is a man, what has he got?\n\nIf not himself, then he has naught\n\nTo say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels\n\nThe record shows I took the blows and did it my way\n\nYes, it was my way"
