  "lyrics": "Hear me out, it ain't easy but I'll try to explain\r\nEverything in the world gets labeled and named\r\nA box, a rough definition, unavoidable\r\nWho picked the label doesn't want to be responsible\r\nTruth, you're the warden, here's the keys to the prison\r\nYou create your own box, you don't have to listen\n\nTo any of the label makers, printing your obituary\n\n\n\nHere's an example\n\nIf Joe Blow says \"Yo, you paint like Caravaggio\"\n\nYou'll respond \"No, that's an insult, Joe\"\n\n\"I live in a vacuum, I ain't coppin' no one.\"\n\nListen up, son\n\n\n\nEveryone creating is a member of the family\n\nPassing down genes and ideas in harmony\n\nThe players and the cynics might be thinking it's odd\n\nBut if you rewind the tape, we're all copying god\n\nCopying god, copying god\n\nCopying god, copying god\n\nAdd your own piece, but the puzzle is god's\n\n\n\nPaying interest on the bills of late, but\n\nI just can't seem to remember the dates\n\nI lay low and turn off the lamps\n\nCome on over, you can lick the stamps and\n\nWe could put together a portfolio and\n\nSing hallelujah in stereo\n\nIf we find a baby, let her into the hold, but\n\nKeep the car running on molten gold\n\n\n\nWe got fever and there ain't no cure, girl\n\nTake out insurance if you ain't too sure, girl\n\nWe do things that lovers do well\n\nNever have to ever hear the rings of school bells\n\nPlaid jeans, no cellular phone\n\nAll the time in the world, no twilight zone\n\nMy time is mine and they know they can't get it\n\nJ. B. told me you got to hit it and quit it\n\n\n\nI'm never gonna go where you want me to go, 'cause\n\nI got feelings that you just don't know and you can\n\nListen up if you want to hear\n\nAnd if you can't stand it, then... right here\n\nThe name of the tune is Cool Hand Luke, 'cause\n\nI got stripes on my pants and boots\n\nIn prison you could learn a lesson\n\nFrom the analog to the hot box session\n\nListen"
