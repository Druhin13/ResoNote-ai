You got it!\n\n\n\nDon't fall on my face\n\nYeah\n\nDon't fall on my faith, oh\n\nDon't fall on my fate\n\nLight him up!\n\nDon't fall on my faith, oh\n\nRrr\n\nDon't fall on my fate\n\nLook\n\n\n\nSomebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it\n\nOr have his body baggage zipped\n\nThe closest thing he's had to hits is smacking bitches\n\nAnd don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks\n\nSay this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly\n\nEven when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot\n\nLacking with it, \"he ain't spit like this in his last shit\"\n\nHoe, you better go back and listen\n\nYou know me better, thinkin' I'll slow up, let up\n\nCall it traps 'cause it's a total setup\n\nHopin' that you rappers fall in that\n\nDre said, \"Hold your head up\"\n\nKathy Griffin stackin' ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition, this is how I shot a head (pew)\n\nGabby Giffords, my attack is viscous, jack the ripper, back in business\n\nTyler create nothing, I see why you called yourself a faggot, bitch\n\nIt's not just 'cause you lack attention\n\nIt's 'cause you worship D12's balls, you're sacrilegious\n\nIf you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better\n\nGet Earl, the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together some words, more than two letters\n\nThe fans waited for this moment\n\nLike the feature when I stole this show\n\nSorry if I took forever\n\n\n\nDon't fall on my face\n\nYeah\n\nDon't fall on my faith, oh\n\nI won't\n\nDon't fall on my fate\n\nLight him up!\n\nDon't fall on my faith, oh\n\nHa\n\nDon't fall on my fate\n\nIt's too easy\n\n\n\nJust rememberâ€“I was here before you\n\nAnd I'll be here after you make your run-in for you\n\nDetract this, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew\n\nJust what the doctor ordered\n\nRevenge is the best medicine\n\nIncrease the dose, unleash the monster\n\nThen tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches\n\nSo they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em\n\nSee the show, every parasite needs a host\n\nThen give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of\n\nAll I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered\n\nTime to separate the sheep from goats\n\nAnd I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts\n\nWhen rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer\n\nA beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air\n\nSomewhere, some kid is bumping this while he lip-syncs in the mirror\n\nThat's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care\n\nBut you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket how I'm buryin' these artists\n\nOn the scale it turns to minus\n\nMines is various as hardly and what's scary is you prolly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm barely gettin' started\n\nAnd as far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone\n\nOr I'll show you an Elvis clone\n\nWalk up in this house you own\n\nBrush my pelvic bone\n\nYou should tell a phone and go fetch me the remote\n\nPut my feet up and just make myself at home\n\nI belong here, clown!\n\nDon't tell me 'bout the culture\n\nI inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9\"s, and oh\n\nBrought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, pissed and moaned, but I'm not gonna fall... bitch!\n\n\n\nIt's too loud\n\nCan't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot\n\nIt's too loud\n\nFreeze my crown all up in it\n\nSlow fire"
