(Why you cryin'?)\nI know my life has been surprising, mama\nYou say the old me is dyin', mama (Mama)\nSay I'm happy, you know that I'm lying, mama (Yeah)\nYou gotta tell me why you cryin', mama\nThese different pills that you been finding, mama\nYou worried that your son is dying, mama\nSay I'm happy, you know that I'm lying, mama\n\nShe don't want no presents, she just want my presence\nShe retire, I'll give her a mil like \"What's a pension?\"\nAll she tell me is save money and count all my blessings\n\nFrequent shopping, now my closet got designer sections (Mama)\nShe told me stay humble, but I want it all\nI'm shooting all the shots for all the times I couldn't ball\nAshamed at how I been livin', I don't wanna take your call\nMy fam that turned they back on me, I don't miss them at all\nFuck 'em all, yeah yeah, fuck 'em all\nThey want me to fall, I just stack my money tall\nCut 'em off, yeah, cut 'em off\nWe'll never be the same, I'm cut from a different cloth\n\nWhy you cryin', mama? (Why you cryin'?)\nI know my life has been surprising, mama\nYou say the old me is dyin', mama (Mama)\n\nSay I'm happy, you know that I'm lying, mama\nYou gotta tell me why you cryin', mama (Why you cryin'?)\nThese different pills that you been finding, mama (Why you cryin'?)\nYou worried that your son is dying, mama (Why you cryin'?)\nSay I'm happy, you know that I'm lying, mama (Why you cryin'?)\n(Why you cryin'?\nWhy you cryin'?)"
