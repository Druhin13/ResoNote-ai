That was my homework\n\nYou can't understand the highway 'till you hit the road first\n\nThinking I was a draft pick the minute I had that growth spurt\n\nSame nigga played the corner, bodega with no shirt\n\nSunflower seeds and Sour Patches, I was askin'\n\nFor extensions on the rent, now it's designer fabric (designer)\n\nCouldn't sit on auntie furniture, if not the plastic (we couldn't )\n\nReally gotta be out your mind to survive the madness\n\nIt ain't hard to buy a boat, it's hard to find a captain\n\nIt ain't hard to find the smoke, it just depend who askin' ( who want it )\n\nI gave hope to every block that's in upper Manhattan (Harlem)\n\nWe gave dough burn the tips, I use to light my baggies ( burner)\n\nDon't focus on us, focus on keepin' wifey happy\n\n\n\nIf you my nigga, you ain't ever gotta question it\n\nI give you my last, I think my heart too big to measure it\n\nStep on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been\n\nIf you my nigga, you ain't ever gotta question it\n\nStep on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been\n\n\n\nIt was so real\n\nBreakfast lunch and dinner was oatmeal\n\nI don't drink soda but I'm so familiar with coke deals\n\nThey robbed him when he bought it, ain't get to see how that coat feels\n\nMight not know her name but I could tell you how her throat feels\n\nYou don't really know me, you ain't know me when I sold pills\n\nBubb told me don't pour it up if it ain't got no seal\n\nChill never paid the the bills, mental racin' still\n\nHad no TV, now I pay multiple cable bills\n\nI remember Malil tellin' me \"take the wheel\"\n\nBack when Freekey told me rap they probably gonna make a deal\n\n[?] I hate the way it make me feel\n\nIf my niggas slidin', I'm slidin', I really played the field\n\nWe got felonies but jealously can never break us\n\nTalked to Drizzy up in Toronto, I'm missin' hella paper\n\nMost of my niggas do biz chasin' money, go up north and get big\n\nMight come home to no crib\n\nWe got parole on us, walk with the heat, we keep the stove on us\n\nNYPD just pray that I get pulled with old warrants\n\nIf you told on us, on God, you broke the code on us\n\n5 in the mornin', in your momma crib with no warnin'\n\n\n\nIf you my nigga you ain't ever gotta question it\n\nI give you my last, I think my heart too big to measure it\n\nStep on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been\n\n\n\nIf you my nigga you ain't ever gotta question it\n\nStep on the gas, I'm standin' up 'cause I could never sit\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been\n\nTryna take my niggas to all the places they never been"
