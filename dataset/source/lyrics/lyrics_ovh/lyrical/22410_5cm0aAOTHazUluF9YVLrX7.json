  "lyrics": "You can still find Ev on the block\r\nSomewhere between a hard place and a rock\r\nMy dresser draw gun under the socks\r\nNothing fun about shooting one but summer is hot\r\nHey young world Slick Rick is still the ruler\r\nGo follow these dopes if you broke to the jeweller\n\nI'm an artist getting something out of fucking [?]\n\nReal MacGyver making something out of something useless\n\nI don't have to prove myself to people I never met, a new rule in itself\n\nRemind me not to forget, I'm reinvented my name\n\nI would have did a long time ago if I wanted fame\n\nAin't relying on no claim to fame, just more bangers\n\nNo more strangers, only Chuck Strangers\n\nThe older I get, the less that I speak\n\nI do my dirt, the lonely [?]\n\n\n\nI've been living in a bubble\n\nDon't make me bust yours\n\nYou settle for less, I settle the score\n\nSure as waves at the shore and two add two is four\n\nI've been eating all my life and still hungry for more\n\n\n\nI'm from the coast\n\nYeah, here's a toast\n\nToward a step of what I want to become\n\nShed so much skin the old Michael is gone\n\nAnd everything I stood for is waging it's war\n\nI miss the road when I'm at home and miss home on tour\n\nLying to myself to say that I ain't changed\n\nI ain't trying to play stupid saying I ain't aged\n\nI earned the right to be hated in the worst way\n\nHappy belated, go shawty it's your birthday\n\nI'm from a city called this is not your birth place\n\nMotherfuckers just landing round in first base\n\nI should have said it in the first place\n\nPack my bags I brought the worst case\n\nBefore the traffic, good city mad kid\n\nHalf like Mike plus half light from [?]\n\n\n\nI've been living in a bubble\n\nDon't make me bust yours\n\nYou settle for less, I settle the score\n\nSure as waves at the shore and two add two is four\n\nI've been eating all my life and still hungry for more\n\n\n\nI've got a slow flow because he is vicious\n\nA rolling stone ain't home like Keith Richards\n\nI'm out my lane, swerving on the shoulder\n\nAn alcoholic flow bumping 21 on [?]\n\nI know what to write way before I say it\n\nSometimes it ain't so bright but I still lay it down\n\nIt gets busy known in this town and still put on for a city when nobody's around\n\nVenice Beach til I die, tell a friend bitch\n\nI've been sharp between the years and my friends rich\n\nI stay connected in places, respected by faces\n\nI make hits and steal consecutive bases\n\nThere's no such thing as bad publicity\n\nWho's fucking with my clique, click clack in Italy\n\nI make a beat, grab a mic and spit a [?]\n\nVenice Beach until I split to Venice, Italy\n\n\n\nI've been living in a bubble\n\nDon't make me bust yours\n\nYou settle for less, I settle the score\n\nSure as waves at the shore and two add two is four\n\nI've been eating all my life and still hungry for more"
