  "lyrics": "I love the way your hair falls on your eyes\r\nAnd the way the sun hits them as it dies\r\nThere's poison in the water and the sky\r\nWe'll hold onto each other if we fry\r\nIt's you and me forever, together\n\nFor all that it's worth\n\nAs long as we last on this sweet, scorched Earth\n\n\n\nI love that you're my best friend and my wife\n\nAnd I love our little family and our life\n\nThere's poison in the hearts of cheerless men\n\nI only want to see it come to an end\n\n\n\nIt's you and me forever, together\n\nFor all that it's worth\n\nAs long as we last on this sweet, scorched Earth"
