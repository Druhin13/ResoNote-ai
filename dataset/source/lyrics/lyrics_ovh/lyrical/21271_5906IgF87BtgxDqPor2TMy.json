  "lyrics": "With the smell of the smoke filling up the air\r\nFire spreading at my feet now\r\nAnd it burns and it fills every bit of you\r\nWe are igniting\r\nWe are igniting\n\nWhen the fire burns out how will we know\n\nWill we get back to the place that we called home\n\nWhen the smoke clears from everything we've known\n\nWill we get back to the place that we called home\n\n\n\nNo comfort and sleepless nights\n\nWe suffer in silence\n\nNo comfort and tired days\n\nThere is a fire between us\n\n\n\nIt was like bliss when we spoke\n\nBut lost her hand in all the smoke\n\nI could always sense her smell\n\nShe was the perfect kind of hell\n\n\n\nWe are together forever burning\n\nBut I could always sense her smell\n\nShe was the perfect kind of hell\n\n\n\nI'm setting fire setting fire\n\nSetting fire to my soul\n\nSetting fire to my soul\n\n\n\nBlue and burning they take me away\n\nIf this is how it ends\n\nI'm letting go\n\nI'm letting go\n\n\n\nYour eyes set fire\n\nThey set fire to my soul"
