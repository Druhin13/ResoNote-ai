Woo!\n\n\n\nYou call my name (You call my name)\n\nFrom the front porch (Front porch)\n\nAnd I'll come running home to you (Home to you, you, you)\n\nYou call my name (You call my name)\n\nAnd I come running, running, running, running\n\nRunning, running, running, running\n\nRunning on home to you\n\n\n\nJust a kid from the neighbourhood\n\nWe're all kids from a neighbourhood\n\nTake me back to '96\n\nI fall asleep with the radio on\n\nI'll be ready come the daylight\n\nI woke up saying, \"It's about time\"\n\n\n\nRelentless\n\nLike a dog on a bone\n\nWe got gas in the tank to go all night\n\nWe got gas in the tank to go all night\n\nRelentless\n\nWe don't walk through it alone\n\nRelentless\n\nIt's time to get to work, now let's get goin'\n\nRelentless\n\nLike a dog on a bone\n\nWe got gas in the tank to go all night\n\nWe got gas in the tank to go all night\n\nRelentless\n\nWe don't walk through it alone\n\nRelentless\n\nIt's time to get to work, now let's get goin'\n\nWoo!"
