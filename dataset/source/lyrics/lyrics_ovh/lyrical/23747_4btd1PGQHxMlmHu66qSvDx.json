  "lyrics": "Make me a necklace of carnelian\r\nBuy me some ribbons for my hair\r\nI will change like a chameleon\r\nIf you show me that you care\r\nTake a deep breath of this virtue\n\nRemember who your princess is\n\nYour smile will be the guardian\n\nOf all my weaknesses\n\n\n\nWill you be the keeper of my heart\n\nWill you be what time has not forgot\n\nWhen I have fallen from your grace\n\nWill you be what time cannot erase\n\nWill you be the keeper baby\n\nWill you hide the darkness deep\n\nWill you be the keeper of my heart\n\n\n\nI rest my gaze upon this ocean\n\nBuried deep inside your eyes\n\nI'm a slave to my emotions\n\nThe innocence that lies\n\n\n\nAnd when the winds of change have broken baby\n\nEvery battle, every bough\n\nWill your anger be unspoken\n\nOn the twilight of this vow\n\n\n\nWill you be the keeper of my heart\n\nWill you be what time has not forgot\n\nWhen I have fallen from your grace\n\nWill you be what time cannot erase\n\nWill you be the keeper baby\n\nWill you hide the darkness deep\n\nWill you be the keeper of my heart\n\n\n\nWill you be the keeper of my heart\n\nWill you be what time has not forgot\n\nWhen I have fallen from your grace\n\nWill you be what time cannot erase\n\nWill you be the keeper baby\n\nWill you hide the darkness deep\n\nWill you be the keeper of my heart\n\n\n\nWill you be the keeper baby\n\nWill you hide the darkness deep\n\nWill you be in my heart"
