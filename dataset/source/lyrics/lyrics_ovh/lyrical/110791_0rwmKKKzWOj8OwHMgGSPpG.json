  "lyrics": "The light flickers on\r\nLike the sparks in my mind\r\nI've been waiting so long\r\nTo change my usage of time\r\nYou know I need it\n\nAll my fears are too strong\n\nHave to keep my hands on what's mine\n\nCause I need it\n\nOh I need it\n\n\n\nI've been walking ahead\n\nAlways losing myself\n\nReplaying words that I've said\n\nFrom the past where I dwell\n\n\n\nGot to find a way somehow to\n\nLive in the now\n\nLive in the now\n\n\n\nTrade my blues for sunshine lately\n\nLive in the now\n\nLive in the now, baby\n\n\n\nThere's always peace to be found\n\nI'm tuning it out\n\nI'm turning it down\n\nTo live in the now\n\n\n\nThe memory fields are all chaff\n\nIt's time to burn them all\n\nAin't no light in the past\n\nJust another black hole\n\nThere's nothing left, honey\n\n\n\nThere's no future that lasts\n\nWhen you don't know the facts\n\nOr what you're living for\n\nCause I need it, oh I need it\n\n\n\nTo love in the now\n\nThis is the now"
