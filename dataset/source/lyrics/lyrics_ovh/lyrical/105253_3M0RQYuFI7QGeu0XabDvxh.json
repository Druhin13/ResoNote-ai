  "lyrics": "I can be romantic\r\nWhen I'm starving for sleep\r\nWhen I try but I can't seem\r\nTo remember anything\r\nWith hair from a dog\r\nI’ve got a fistful of its mane\n\nIt’s too coarse to stomach\n\nSo I shove it down my throat\n\nLuck left late Saturday and now\n\n\n\nJesus Christ I'm wrecked to bed\n\nThey watch me sleeping in the kennel again\n\nI can't recall the bark but the bay, I admit\n\nIf I was listening I could hear it\n\nI’m shock collared at the gates of heaven\n\n25 years that I’ve been trying to shake loose\n\nAnd if I try to sit still\n\nThen someone's breathing down my neck\n\nSo I'm embarrassing myself again\n\nI should see myself out\n\nLay me down in the tub\n\nThrow away my phone\n\nStrap a muzzle to my mouth now\n\nAnd Jesus Christ I'm wrecked to bed\n\nThey watch me sleeping in the kennel again\n\nI can't recall the bark but the bay, I admit\n\nIf I was listening I could hear it\n\nIf I was listening I could hear it\n\n\n\nIf I listen I can hear\n\nPalms kept white hot gold rings folded like a\n\nKnot tied tight sweat leave sleep take me now\n\nI've done nothing right\n\nI've gone wrong beside\n\nI can't see what's there\n\nBut If I listen I can hear\n\nLuck bent low roar drum pressed to the glass\n\nThe glass pressed loose soft spots marked on the wall\n\nWall an empty stomach\n\nI've done nothing right\n\nI can't see what's there\n\nIf I listen I can hear it\n\nPalms kept white hot gold rings folding like a\n\nKnot tied tight sweat leave sleep take me now\n\nI've done nothing right\n\nI've gone wrong beside\n\nI can't see what's there\n\nI can't see anything at all"
