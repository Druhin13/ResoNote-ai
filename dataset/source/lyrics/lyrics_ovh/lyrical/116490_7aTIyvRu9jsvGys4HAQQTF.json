  "lyrics": "I'll never forget the first time kissed her\r\nAnd that's where the story begins\r\nAt a dive bar named [?] in Encinitas\r\nWe met through a mutual friend\r\nHad a hell of a time and we went all night\r\nBy morning she messed up my head\n\nI swore her off, but I'll be damned\n\nI fell in love with tequila again\n\n\n\nWe lost our minds, we danced all night\n\nPicked up right where we left off\n\nRaised hell with the boys\n\nMade all kinds of noise\n\nSinging at the top of our lungs\n\nAnd once again I'll wake up on time\n\nWith the headache turned up to 10\n\nAsking myself why the hell\n\nI fell in love with tequila again\n\n\n\nI've had some lovers, some more than others\n\nThey've all been a bittersweet buzz\n\nAnd I've had some vices, most more than thrice\n\nAnd none does me quite like she does\n\nI try to forget her, wish I'd never met her\n\nBut I [?]\n\nNow come Friday night [?]\n\nI'm back in love with tequila again\n\n\n\nWe'll lose our minds, we'll dance all night\n\nPick up right where we left off\n\nRaise hell with the boys\n\nMake all kinds of noise\n\nSinging at the top of our lungs\n\nYeah once again I'll wake up on time\n\nWith the headache turned up to 10\n\nAsking myself why the hell\n\nI fell in love with tequila again\n\n\n\nThey laid me down, I'll fall in and out\n\nOf love with tequila again"
