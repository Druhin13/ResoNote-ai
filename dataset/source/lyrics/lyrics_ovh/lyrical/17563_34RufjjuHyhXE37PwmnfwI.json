  "lyrics": "I could build a mansion\r\nThat is higher than the trees\r\nI could have all the gifts I want\r\nAnd never ask please\r\nI could fly to Paris\n\nIt's at my beck and calls\n\nWhy do I live my life alone\n\nWith nothing at all\n\n\n\n(But) when I dream, I dream of you\n\nMaybe someday you will come true\n\n\n\nWhen I dream, I dream of you\n\nMaybe someday you will come true\n\n\n\nI can be the singer\n\nOr the clown in any room\n\nI can call up someone\n\nTo take me to the moon\n\nI can put my makeup on\n\nAnd drive the man insane\n\nI can go to bed alone\n\nAnd never know his name"
