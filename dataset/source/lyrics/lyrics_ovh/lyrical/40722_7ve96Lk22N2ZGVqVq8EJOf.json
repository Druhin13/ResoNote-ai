  "lyrics": "If I had another chance tonight\r\nI'd try to tell you that the things we had were right\r\nTime can erase the love we shared\r\nBut it gives me time to realize just how much you cared\r\nNow you're gone, I'm really not the same,\n\nI guess I held myself to blame\n\nTime can erase the things we said\n\nBut it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's sad\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nYou know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found\n\nYou know I can't hold you back now\n\n\n\nNow that I'm alone it gives me time to think about the years that you were mine\n\nTime can erase the love we shared\n\nBut it gives me time to realize just how much you cared\n\n\n\nChorus: You know I won't...\n\n\n\nYou know I won't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found\n\n\n\nYou know I can't hold you back now, the love we had just can't be found"
