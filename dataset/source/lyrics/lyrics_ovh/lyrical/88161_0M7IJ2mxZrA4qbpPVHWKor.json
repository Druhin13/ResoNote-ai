  "lyrics": "This shit crazy\r\nTwo-fifteen\r\nUh, I'm here seated at the helm\r\nThe black soundtrack to confusion is the film\r\nI’m channelin' uncertainty and usin' it to tell the story of winnin' in life, then losin' it as well\n\nThe triumph was Makaveli inspired\n\nAwaken a sleepin' giant, commander Tariq ibn Ziyad\n\nFresh from the fire and into formal attire\n\nThat's from a foreign designer, I call the plug, supplier, but a high we got\n\nTry me not, that's the caveat\n\nYou'd probably get the same thing my last body got\n\nPoet Laureate, swift chariot, the Maserat'\n\nThe one to watch, born the year of the ox\n\nI got more than a reason to revel like Desus and Mero\n\nLyrical religious hero on Jesus' level\n\nThe reason none of these heathens is even as thorough\n\nWe bare arms like Idris or Venus de Milo\n\nMy blood is different than the blood that you bleed if it's yellow\n\nI'm colder than Paul Robeson leadin' Othello\n\nI'm older than the barcode, it ain't easy to tell though\n\nThe rap John Henry, they send me deep in the railroad\n\nI'm heavy metal, the rock roller, the rebel without a pause\n\nPerspective is bipolar as ever, I gotta cross the bridge and then burnt it into ash\n\nA reoccurin' dream and then turnt it into cash\n\nThe reoccurin' theme is the hurt lives in the past\n\nBut undeniable lessons I learned live in the stash\n\nUh, the breadwinner, the dead center, the head-spinner\n\nI heard life is a bitch, I went to bed wit' her\n\nI once was told to know thy self\n\nHow can I grow myself, if I don't know myself?\n\nThe low-hangin' fruit for bottom feeders, no top-shelf\n\nI chase demons for a lotta reasons, not just health\n\nSeated at the throne, summonin' the ghosts like a seance\n\nI never take a day off work, it never pay off\n\nI wish for more peace on this Earth and never chaos\n\nAs long as classrooms gettin' sprayed with the ARs\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nRevelation of a blessin' in disguise\n\nI looked hate in the face and read the message in his eyes\n\nThey clickbaited a nation and requested the response\n\nAnd dictated the makings of another renaissance\n\nBut wait, the fate of it's what the government decides\n\nAnd I don't mean the state, I mean this government of ours\n\nThe mark, Ark of the Covenant requires\n\nFrauds, I'm makin' a mockery of 'em with the bars alone\n\nThe population of the world has grown\n\nAnd more people in the streets than live in gorgeous homes\n\nA lotta heavy conflict zones, the swords are shown\n\nI'm tryna study all the language on the Georgia Stones\n\nTo quote the classic joint, “What a fool believes”\n\nAnd what the teachers of the school believes\n\nIs very different from what the thieves and the class in rule believes\n\nI'm tryna give y'all some jewelries\n\nWe under pressure like a diamond mine\n\nHuntin' it somethin' like a phenomenon\n\nAnd we losin' light like M. Night Shyamalan\n\nThem people searchin' for somethin' with body armor on\n\nYou never know who they wantin', that’s why we on the law\n\nPreparin' me, that isn’t necessary, what I'm haunted by is knowin' where the bodies are buried\n\nYet, I'm taunted by the omen\n\nKnowin' my adversary, I'm gone to Neveruary\n\nIt’s on, it’s gettin' heavy for real"
