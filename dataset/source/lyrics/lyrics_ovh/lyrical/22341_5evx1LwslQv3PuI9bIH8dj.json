  "lyrics": "Searching in the distance\r\nFor a promise yet to come\r\nMy fortitude is fading\r\nHow much longer can I run\r\nTurning stones\n\nTo see what I can find\n\n\n\nMemories are breaking\n\nLike the shore against the sea\n\nEvery night, I'm aching\n\nFor the way things used to be\n\n\n\nI can't let go\n\nBut still, I have to try\n\nI'm turning stones\n\nTo see what I can find\n\n\n\nThough, I haven't found a glimmer or a reason\n\nTo believe we'll be all right\n\nEven in the darkest season\n\nThere's a ray of hope where shadows cannot shine\n\nWhere shadows only die\n\n\n\nI'm leaving every ghost\n\nAnd every spirit in the past\n\nI'm gonna find new meaning\n\nAnd redemption that will last\n\n\n\nThis I hope\n\nThe wounds will heal in time\n\nI'm turning stones\n\nTo see what I might find\n\n\n\nThough, I haven't found a glimmer or a reason\n\nTo believe we'll be all right\n\nEven in the darkest season\n\nThere's a ray of hope where shadows cannot shine\n\n\n\nPraying for the answers\n\nTo a God I've never seen\n\nMy aching turns to anger\n\nFrom a whisper to a scream\n\n\n\nI must let go\n\nIf only to survive\n\nI'm turning stones\n\nTo see what I can find\n\nI'm turning stones\n\nTo leave the past behind"
