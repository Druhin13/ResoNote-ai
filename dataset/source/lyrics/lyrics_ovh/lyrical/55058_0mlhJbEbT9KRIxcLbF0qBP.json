  "lyrics": "She going down but I belong for this love\r\nBlew from your body\r\nI thank goddess 'cause you got me through the rush\r\nConsumed all I wanted\r\nCought between the middle of your slow style\r\nAnd tangled up in 3 AM good morning nights we trust\n\nThat pussy's got me living like I died and fell in love\n\nBut I just wanted to say\n\n\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\n\n\nFeeling steady, girl, you win me with your drug\n\nNow I'm only getting started\n\nI spin in circles, found my purpose was too low\n\nSwear that now she's showing off to get me turned on\n\nGot me rolling slow and down to finish\n\nGirl, I'll still go in oceans, 'til the morning comes\n\n'Til the morning comes\n\n\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\n\n\nGot nothing to prove\n\nGot nothing to prove\n\n\n\nFeeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high\n\nI'm feeling on that body high"
