  "lyrics": "Oh my God, it's system overload\r\nExceed yourself, you'll crash till you implode\r\nTransmission of a new vibration sounds\r\nNo limitations drag you underground\r\nPleasure, pleasure, pleasure\n\nBuilding the pressure\n\nTill you explode\n\n\n\nStereo Shot like a gun\n\nOnce fired it's outta control\n\nThe danger is half the fun\n\nStereo Shot like a gun\n\nInject it straight to your soul\n\nAnd into your world, oh-oh\n\n\n\nOh my God, it's system overload\n\nIntoxicate your taste for radio\n\nRemission of the waves as they resound\n\nWith pure addiction, feed your kicks for sound\n\n\n\nPleasure, pleasure, pleasure\n\nBuilding the pressure\n\nTill you explode\n\n\n\nStereo Shot like a gun\n\nOnce fired it's outta control\n\nThe danger is half the fun\n\nStereo Shot like a gun\n\nInject it straight to your soul\n\nAnd into your world, oh-oh\n\n\n\nPleasure, pleasure\n\nRemission of the waves as they resound\n\nPleasure, pleasure, pleasure\n\nFeed your kicks for sound\n\nPleasure, pleasure\n\n\n\nStereo Shot like a gun\n\nThe danger is half the fun\n\nStereo Shot like a gun\n\nInject it straight to your soul\n\nInto your world, oh-oh"
