She's tellin' me \"yes\"\n\n\n\nI got confidence in myself\n\nBut that's just Tequila giving me help\n\nTryna cover it up, so you never tell\n\nI feel like dancin' with you\n\n\n\nIt's your moves, baby\n\n'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do\n\nBut I got that love that you ain't used to, hey\n\nAnd when the DJ's spinnin' that song that we groove to\n\nOh my, come and teach me how to dance\n\n\n\nSlow down!\n\nAnd DJ, play that track\n\nCheck out my kung-fu kicks, like I'm under attack\n\nI wave my arms like this from front to back\n\nBut you never seen a bad mother dance like that\n\nThen you're picking me up with a kiss on the lips\n\nJump into the middle, come on, wiggle your hips\n\nMy love, take my hand, I'll give you a spin\n\nStep once, step twice, let the party begin\n\n\n\nI got confidence in myself\n\nBut that's just Tequila giving me help\n\nTryna cover it up, so you never tell\n\nI feel like dancin' with you\n\n\n\nIt's your moves, baby\n\n'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (yeah)\n\nBut I got that love that you ain't used to, hey\n\nAnd when the DJ's spinnin' that song that we groove to\n\nOh my, come and teach me how to dance\n\n\n\nDance to the rhythm of the D.O. dub, G and a thug\n\nWatch how I be in the club\n\nLookin', starin', darin', comparin'\n\nIn my book, they say sharin' is carin'\n\nSo give me a taste (ha ha)\n\nAnd make your hips just dip to the bass\n\nAnd watch me run the line\n\nSee what I come to find?\n\n\n\nIt's your moves, baby (ya dig?)\n\n'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (yeah)\n\nBut I got that love that you ain't used to (ha ha), hey (Snoop!)\n\nAnd when the DJ spinnin' that song that we groove to\n\nOh my, come and teach me how to dance\n\n\n\nIt's your moves, baby (dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dog)\n\n'Cause I can't dance in the way that you do (in my book, they say sharin' is carin')\n\nBut I got that love that you ain't used to (dance to the rhythm of the D.O. dog)\n\nAnd when the DJ spinnin' that song that we groove to\n\n(you know we about to make moves)\n\nOh my, come and teach me how to dance (ya dig?)"
