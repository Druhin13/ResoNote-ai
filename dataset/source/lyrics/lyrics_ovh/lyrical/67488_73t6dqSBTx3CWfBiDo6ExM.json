  "lyrics": "I don't know when I'm running out of time\r\nI remember there's night time too\r\nAnd that's just the right time\r\nTo be spent with you\r\nWhen I feel a little more lost\n\nThen I thought I could be\n\nI tried to open my eyes\n\nAnd let the tears find me\n\n\n\nYou know it's been a long year, already\n\nAnd we haven't been met with much sincerity\n\nThat's just how I feel\n\nWhat am I suppose to be?\n\nWhat am I suppose to be?\n\n\n\nIf you think you've heard it all before\n\nBetter think it through\n\nCause there was just one way\n\nThat I opened my heart to you\n\n\n\nYou know it's been a long year, already\n\nAnd we haven't been met with much security\n\nWell is that just how it is?\n\nHow are we suppose to be?\n\nHow are we suppose to be?\n\n\n\nWith all the confusion that's on my mind\n\nAnd I'm more black than blue\n\nI don't know where to start\n\nBut I may as well try to start with you"
