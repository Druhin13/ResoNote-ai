  "lyrics": "Every seme the Devil breathes\r\nMy steps never outweighed the gravity ov hell\r\nSo I keep praying for rain ov flaming rocks\r\nTo foster the symmetry ov worlds\r\nI had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness\n\nNever found on neither side ov the moon\n\nIt wields composure ov my soul\n\nThat comes as one with the odium below\n\n\n\nChant the psalm\n\nNon serviam\n\nRetrieve the pride\n\nWithin and without\n\n\n\n[Spoken part translated]\n\nI throw out each flaw, any idea.\n\nI trust not any abstraction.\n\nI believe not in god nor mind\n\nenough with these gods.\n\nGive me a human.\n\nLet him be just like me, just like me\n\nDull, unripe, unfinished, not dark, and not bright.\n\nSo that I may with him dance, play with him,\n\nwith him fight, in front of him pretend,\n\ngive him thanks, and him, rape...\n\nfall in love with him, through him recreate myself,\n\ngrow through him, and sprouting this way,\n\nwed myself, in the church ov man\n\n\n\n\n\nI imagined the most ardent ray ov sun\n\nLike vulture hovering above my neck\n\nIt burns with fever deep within my soul\n\nErect in glory to sink into shame\n\n\n\nOh lord, whence came this doubt?\n\nThou doth know I am all and everything\n\nLet loose my shackles\n\nLet chaos reign\n\nInfecting moral arteries...\n\n\n\nChant the psalm\n\nNon serviam\n\nRetrieve the pride\n\nWithin and without"
