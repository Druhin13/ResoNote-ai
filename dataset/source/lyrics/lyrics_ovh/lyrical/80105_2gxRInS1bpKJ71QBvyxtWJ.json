  "lyrics": "Looking out a dirty old window.\r\nDown below the cars in the city go rushing by.\r\nI sit here alone and I wonder why.\r\nFriday night and everyone's moving.\r\nI can feel the heat but it's soothing.\n\nHeading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.\n\n\n\nDown town the young ones are going.\n\nDown town the young ones are growing.\n\n\n\nWe're the kids in America.\n\nWe're the kids in America.\n\nEverybody live for the music-go-round.\n\n\n\nBright ligths the music get faster.\n\nLook boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.\n\nI'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.\n\n\n\nHot-shot, give me no problems.\n\nMuch later baby you'll be saying never mind.\n\nYou know life is cruel, life is never kind.\n\n\n\nKind hearts don't make a new story.\n\nKind hearts don't grab any glory.\n\n\n\nWe're the kids in America.\n\nWe're the kids in America.\n\nEverybody live for the music-go-round.\n\n\n\nCome closer, honey that's better.\n\nGot to get a brand new experience.\n\nFeeling right.\n\nOh don't try to stop baby.\n\nHold me tight.\n\n\n\nOutside a new day is dawning.\n\nOutside Suburbia's sprawling everywhere.\n\nI don't want to go baby.\n\nNew York to East California.\n\nThere's a new wave coming I warn you.\n\n\n\nWe're the kids in America.\n\nWe're the kids in America.\n\nEverybody live for the music-go-round.\n\n\n\nWe're the kids\n\nWe're the kids\n\nWe're the kids in America."
