  "lyrics": "You were the best thing\r\nAnd I was so investing\r\nAnd I need you tell me\r\nThat you're not too far gone\r\nAnd I should've learned my lesson\n\nWhen you heard that I was texting\n\nHer and all my exes\n\nAnd now you're too far gone\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be here arms open\n\nBut you made it clear that you're not coming\n\n\n\nSo I'll need more than one drink to get over you\n\nAnd I know it's not the right way to cope but\n\nI don't know how to handle my emotions\n\nOne drink to get over you\n\nAnd I know that I'll regret it in the morning\n\nIt's the bottle not my heart that I've been pouring\n\n\n\nOne drink\n\n\n\nAnd I need someone else to\n\nHelp me to forget you\n\nUse her body as a refuge\n\nBefore I'm too far gone\n\n\n\nCan't stop looking at the pictures\n\nThat I took when I was with you\n\nWe had something special\n\nBut now you're too far gone\n\n\n\nAnd I'll be here arms open\n\nBut you made it clear that you're not coming\n\n\n\nSo I'll need more than one drink to get over you\n\nAnd I know it's not the right way to cope but\n\nI don't know how to handle my emotions\n\nOne drink to get over you\n\nAnd I know that I'll regret it in the morning\n\nIt's the bottle not my heart that I've been pouring\n\n\n\nOne drink\n\n\n\nOne drink\n\nTwo hearts\n\nThree words\n\nI'm in love\n\nOne drink\n\nTwo hearts\n\nThree words\n\nI'm in love\n\nOne drink\n\nTwo hearts\n\nThree words\n\nI'm in love\n\nOne drink\n\nTwo hearts\n\nThree words\n\nI'm in love\n\n\n\nSo I'll need more than one drink to get over you\n\nAnd I know it's not the right way to cope but\n\nI don't know how to handle my emotions\n\nOne drink to get over you\n\nAnd I know that I'll regret it in the morning\n\nIt's the bottle not my heart that I've been pouring"
