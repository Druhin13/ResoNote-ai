  "lyrics": "Angels smoking cigarettes on rooftops in fishnets in the morning with the\r\nMoon still glowing\r\nAnd here comes Jesus in an Astrovan rolling down the strip again\r\nHe's stoned while Jerry plays\r\nLife ain't ever what it seems\n\nThese dreams are more than paper things\n\nAnd it's alright mama you're afraid\n\nI'll be poor along the way\n\nI don't wanna see those tears again\n\nYou know, Jesus drives an Astrovan\n\nYes, he does (I say: whoo)\n\n\n\nAnd in my heart there's a holy ghost writhing on the floor from an overdose\n\nYou know the best ones never come down\n\nSo if I love at the tip of my toes reaching out for the great unknown\n\nEvery addict has illusions\n\n\n\nLife ain't ever what it seems\n\nThese dreams are more than paper things\n\nAnd it's alright mama you're afraid\n\nI'll be here along the way\n\nI don't wanna see those tears again\n\nYou know Jesus drives an Astrovan\n\nYes, he does (I say: whoo)\n\n\n\nAnd when I see those angels on the roof\n\nI know I've made it when my\n\nDoobie smoking Jesus puts my name up on his guestlist\n\nHe said son you're famous in heaven\n\nMaybe you're famous in heaven\n\nMaybe there is no heaven\n\nMaybe we're all along together now\n\nBut I don't wanna see those tears again\n\nYou know Jesus drives an Astrovan\n\n\n\nI don't wanna see those tears again\n\nYou know Jesus drives an Astrovan"
