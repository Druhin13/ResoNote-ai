  "lyrics": "Steadfast forecast this was always meant to be\r\nSent down by the angels\r\nHeartbreak can't fade all the plans that were made\r\nBy a baby in a manger\r\nBright light so bright it was shining like a north star\r\nAnswer to a prayer\n\nHow could I have known, that you would come along\n\n\n\nWhen I was a little girl\n\nI wondered who Id give all my love to\n\nI asked Santa who he'd recommend\n\nIt's hard to believe I was so innocent\n\n\n\nAs a little girl looking at the world\n\nDidn't know that love could break me\n\nI was lying in my tears on the ground\n\nCouldn't see where God would take me\n\nHere I am now looking at you\n\nGot me thinking that love could save me\n\nHow could I have known, that you would come along\n\n\n\nWhen I was a little girl\n\nI wondered who Id give all my love to\n\nI asked Santa who he'd recommend\n\nIt's hard to believe I was so innocent\n\n\n\nWhen I was a little girl\n\nI had love at the top of my wish list\n\nAll my dreams were so unlimited\n\nIt's hard to believe I was so innocent\n\n\n\nWhy do you feel so much like home to me (Home to me)\n\nWhy do you feel so much like home to me\n\n\n\nWhen I was a little girl\n\nI wondered who Id give all my love to\n\nI asked Santa who he'd recommend\n\nIt's hard to believe I was so innocent\n\n\n\nWhen I was a little girl\n\nI had love at the top of my wish list\n\nAll my dreams were so unlimited\n\nIt's hard to believe I was so innocent\n\n\n\nWhy do you feel so much like home to me"
