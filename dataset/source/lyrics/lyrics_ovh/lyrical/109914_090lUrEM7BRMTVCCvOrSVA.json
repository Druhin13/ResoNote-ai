  "lyrics": "This healthy, unhealthy voice\r\nSits Lennon for you\r\nYour healthy, unhealthy voices\r\nIt's several for me\r\nNow who wants to live the soul's desire\n\nWay down we're born to realize\n\nOne sobering thought was forced upon\n\nWe shall know we'll know\n\n\n\nThese slivers that warn our feet\n\nReminders joining us\n\nTo the rest, to the worst\n\nThe worst is yet to come\n\nTo the rest, all the best\n\nThe best is yet to come\n\n\n\nNow who wants to live the soul's desire\n\nWay down we're born to realize\n\nOne sobering thought was forced upon\n\nWe shall know we'll know\n\n\n\nA silent stare brings the creeping clone\n\nWon't feel you walking in but feel you walking out\n\nYour silent stare brings us closer still\n\nAnd all her wants out\n\nKeep biting in\n\n\n\nNow who wants to live the soul's desire\n\nWay down we're born to realize\n\nOne sobering thought was forced upon\n\nWe shall know we'll know"
