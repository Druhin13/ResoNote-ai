  "lyrics": "I remember the look on your face\r\nIt plays on my mind as I lie awake\r\nI heard your voice at the end of a tape\r\nStatic flickers and fades away\r\nYeah I know that I've made my mistakes\n\nBut I hope that I see you again\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\n\n\nPain, it comes and goes in waves\n\nThe colours are starting to fade away\n\nI call, I call and I talk to your friends\n\nPassing time as it bends and breaks\n\n\n\nYeah I know that I've made my mistakes\n\nBut I hope that I see you again\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\n\n\nSo I guess this is time to say goodbye\n\nYeah I guess this is time to close the door\n\nSo I guess this is time to say goodbye\n\nYeah I guess this is time to say goodnight\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life\n\nI'll see you in another life"
