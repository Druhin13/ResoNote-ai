  "lyrics": "Sometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken\r\nSometimes we long for the unspoken\r\nWe try to avoid every commotion\r\nBy showing hardly any emotion\r\nSometimes it seems we're at the wrong station\r\nLooking for a deadly combination\n\nSometimes it feels like imagination\n\nLooking for all these cheap sensations\n\n\n\nWhy don't we go against the tide\n\nAgainst all their advice\n\nWe keep running, we keep on running\n\nIt's just a matter of time\n\n\n\nBefore it all\n\nEchos, echos and goes\n\nCrashing against the walls\n\nHold my hand and keep your eyes closed\n\nBefore it all\n\nEchos, echos and falls\n\nI suppose it's just a matter of time\n\n\n\nSometimes it feels like it's meant to be broken\n\nSometimes we act like we've already chosen\n\nWe try to retrieve something stolen\n\nBy remembering how it used to be golden\n\n\n\nWhy don't we go against the tide\n\nAgainst all their advice\n\nWe keep running, we keep on running\n\nIt's just a matter of time\n\n\n\nBefore it all\n\nEchos, echos and goes\n\nCrashing against the walls\n\nHold my hand and keep your eyes closed\n\nBefore it all\n\nEchos, echos and falls\n\nI suppose it's just a matter of time\n\n\n\nBefore it all\n\nEchos, echos and goes\n\nCrashing against the walls\n\nHold my hand and keep your eyes closed\n\nBefore it all\n\nEchos, echos and falls\n\nI suppose it's just a matter of time"
