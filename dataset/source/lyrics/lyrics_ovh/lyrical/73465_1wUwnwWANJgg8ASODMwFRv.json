  "lyrics": "Real shit from My Mind\r\nCan you tell me where the love at\r\nIt’s like I’m wasting my time\r\nTrying to get these dollar bills back\r\nAnd all I feel is hate\r\nCan you tell me where my fam at\n\nCause everybody’s changed\n\nLike what the fuck is this bullshit\n\nAnd babymomma tripping\n\nBut that ain’t nothing new\n\nAnd my friends be switching\n\nLike what the fuck did I do\n\nI keep it real homie\n\nAnd that’s for real homie\n\nSo if you walking out my life\n\nThen disappear on me\n\nI don’t give a fuck about no hoe\n\nI don’t give a fuck about no bitch\n\nOne time I gave this girl my heart\n\nBut I guess she fucking lost that shit\n\nAnd now I’m cold as a motherfucker\n\nShorty hit me up like Ky let me come over\n\nAnd I don’t text back\n\nI say fuck that\n\nThat’s a waste of time\n\nMe and you\n\nWe’re on a different grind\n\nYou’re thinking sex\n\nAnd I’m thinking fine\n\nBut at the same time\n\nI’m chasing dollar signs\n\nAnd the real love is where my dogs are at\n\nMan I hope you feel this\n\nRealest motherfucker you ever met\n\nOne day I’m gonna do this on the top\n\nBut I don’t wanna do this shit anymore\n\nAnymore, anymore\n\nIt’s no longer love when it turns to war, no\n\nMy minds gone\n\nSo I hit that\n\nNow my eyes closed\n\nBut the memories coming back\n\nAnd I don’t wanna deal with that\n\nSo I say fuck it\n\nTake another shot\n\nThink I might call\n\nBut I better not\n\nSpent a lot of money on that fucking rock\n\nI should care less if you fucking rot\n\nBut I do, I do\n\nAnd I usually wouldn’t say that\n\nBut you had that precious little thing that calls me da da\n\nAnd our views\n\nWe always had completely different views\n\nHonestly you’ll probably never like a fucking thing I do\n\nBut I’m smoking this for you\n\nDedicate this blunt to you\n\nFor all the bullshit\n\nAnd the heartaches\n\nAnd the pain I put you through\n\nIf I could I would roll these memories up in a J\n\nI’d pearl that motherfucker\n\nAnd I’d smoke the pain away"
