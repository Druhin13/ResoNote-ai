  "lyrics": "I can't stop you girl from crying\r\nBut I can write a song to catch your tears\r\nIn the morning, I'll come a roaring\r\nCan you hear it\r\nI can't stop the day from dying\n\nBut I can sing the sunset for your ears\n\nGold and orange, slowly falling\n\nCan you hear it\n\n\n\nI don't know how this is gonna go down\n\nBut you should know now\n\nDarling I don't fear it\n\nIt's a verse and it's a chorus\n\nLaying out before us\n\nAnd it only gets louder as we near it, near it, near it\n\nDolly can you hear it?\n\n\n\nWell it's hard to tell the difference between new love\n\nAnd a true love that will never ever fail\n\nOne it fades out, the other stays loud\n\nCan you hear it\n\n\n\nWhen you're dancing in the corner of your loneliness\n\nAnd nobody comes and takes you by the hand\n\nOut of the shadows I'll come dancing and laughing\n\nCan you hear it\n\n\n\nI don't know how this is gonna go down\n\nBut you should know now\n\nDarling I don't fear it\n\nIt's a verse and it's a chorus\n\nLaying out before us\n\nAnd it only gets louder as we near it, near it, near it\n\nDolly can you hear it?"
