Oh shit, it's like 5 in the morning\n\nI'm tryna hold on, but I can't get a hold of you\n\nWhat is it you're waiting for?\n\nFor me to say that we are through?\n\nSo are you with me or is nothing feelin' me or frontin', yeah\n\nWhen I waited on the text (It never comes)\n\nAnd when I waited on your ring (It never rung)\n\nI hope that you don’t think you’ll play me like I'm dumb\n\n’Cause I just bossed up, nigga, bossed up\n\nEsa niña e' talentosa, get your coins up\n\nEsa niña e' intelligente, tan hermosa\n\nAin't no nigga can approach ya\n\nCome here closer, let me hold ya\n\n\n\nLet me tell you ’bout the baddest bitches that I know\n\nNever do no crying over hoes, we get the dough\n\nCounting paper, counting paper, watch it overflow\n\nThrow it like a stripper\n\nLet it flow on through the floor, then pick it up\n\nIt's a stick up, stick up\n\nLook at that fatty, getting thicker, bigger\n\n\n\nBaby girl can't get like me\n\nPut the pussy in his face, drippin' on the white tee\n\nSee, I see past IG and them posts on my feed\n\nAnd you know I can read between the lines\n\nAnd know that you'll be back with time, yeah\n\n\n\nLet me tell you 'bout the baddest bitches that I know\n\nNever do no crying over hoes, we get the dough\n\nCounting paper, counting paper, watch it overflow\n\nThrow it like a stripper\n\nLet it flow on through the floor, then pick it up\n\nIt's a stick up, stick up\n\nLook at that fatty, getting thicker, bigger\n\nI hope that you don't think you'll play me like I'm dumb\n\n'Cause I just bossed up, nigga, bossed up"
