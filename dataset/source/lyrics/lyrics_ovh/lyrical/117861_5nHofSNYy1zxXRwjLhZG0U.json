(what?)\n\nFlyin' in a foreign, doing donuts\n\nWatched my whole life change like a movie\n\nFirst day in LA, a hundred groupies\n\nMy shorty in the ends afraid to lose me (lose me)\n\nThey all say I changed but I never changed\n\nI just bought a chain, fuck a wedding ring\n\nBig body Range, pull up in a tank (tank)\n\nTalking down my name, we gon' let it bang\n\nThey gon' claim they gang, ain't really gang (gang)\n\n\n\nNo sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA)\n\nI'ma sail the seven seas just to separate myself from the fakes (fakes)\n\nNo sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA)\n\nSo many days alone, on the road, it was all worth the wait\n\nNo sad, no bad days in LA (in LA, in LA, in LA)"
