  "lyrics": "Don't you know, know, know\r\nIt's a violation\r\nI still hear you saying\r\nSuch a perfect, perfect night\r\nNo, no, no fight all temptation\r\nWell, in a black hearted alley fight\n\nI'm screaming\n\nTake me to the heights tonight\n\nTake me to the top \n\nTake me to the top . . . [repeat]\n\nToo many times\n\nVictim accusation\n\nNo, you don't have to take it like that\n\nA sheer, sheer heart attack\n\nNo, no noit's no realization\n\nI never had a way with you\n\nBut I still hear you saying\n\nTake me to the top \n\nTake me to the top . . . [repeat]\n\n\n\nTake me to the top\n\nTo the top and throw me off . . . [repeat]\n\n\n\nTake me to the top"
