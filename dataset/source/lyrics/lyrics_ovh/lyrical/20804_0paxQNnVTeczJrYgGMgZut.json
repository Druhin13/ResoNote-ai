  "lyrics": "Now we’re floating like two feathers\r\nIn the sunlight and the dust of California\r\nAnd you no longer have to carry me\r\nWe are exactly where I wanted us to be\r\nNo more hesitation\n\nNothing will ever divide us again\n\nNo more energy wasted\n\nOn the temper of our time\n\nJust the truth and the sublime\n\n\n\nSo thank you\n\nYou need to know\n\nThat you dragged me out\n\nOf a mile deep hollow\n\nAnd I love you\n\nYou brought me home\n\n‘cause you dragged me out\n\nOf a mile deep hollow\n\n\n\nWe threw our past in the Atlantic\n\nAnd those eleven days remain in our tool kit\n\nWe took our chances with the desert life\n\nEven though we got lost along the way in our own minds\n\n\n\nWe took all the blows\n\nSearching for purity\n\nWe put an end to all\n\nThe beating up ourselves\n\nAnd the walking on eggshells\n\n\n\nSo thank you\n\nYou need to know\n\nThat you dragged me out\n\nOf a mile deep hollow\n\nAnd I love you\n\nYou brought me home\n\n‘cause you dragged me out\n\nOf a mile deep hollow\n\n\n\nSo thank you (thank you)\n\nYou need to know\n\nThat you dragged me out\n\nOf a mile deep hollow\n\nAnd I love you (I love you)\n\nYou brought me home\n\n‘cause you dragged me out\n\nOf a mile deep hollow\n\n\n\nThank you\n\nI love you\n\nThank you"
