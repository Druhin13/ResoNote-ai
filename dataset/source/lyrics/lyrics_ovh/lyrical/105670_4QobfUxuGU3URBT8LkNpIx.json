  "lyrics": "Cold was the wind on my frozen face\r\nBut I didn't mind, cause I was long gone\r\nCold was the wind upon my brow\r\nBelow that, well, you don't wanna know at all\r\nCold, was the wind (Yeah)\n\n\n\nChristmas in Siberia with the little bitty case of the delirium tremens\n\nFor some reason, picture Roger Clemens\n\nBut Mike Schmidt's more of the city I came with\n\nCrossed my heart, hoped to die\n\nStick a needle in my, butter around your bread\n\n\n\nCold was the wind on my naked brow\n\nBelow it, well, you don't wanna know at all\n\nCold, wind, blows\n\n\n\nCold wind blows on my naked brow\n\nSun sits down on the sacred cow\n\nYou better Goddamn miss me when I'm gone\n\n'Cause God's gonna damn me up and down now\n\nWherever it is, they're gonna give me the business\n\nWhoever it is, gonna miss my girls\n\nOn the plane I'm drinkin red wine, 'cause like everybody else I'm afraid to die\n\nDid I mention that I'm afraid of dying, think I heard my daughter crying\n\nSo I pick her on up, spin her around, live it on up, of what I found\n\n\n\nCold wind blow on my brow\n\nBelow it, well, you don't wanna know at all\n\nCold, wind, blows"
