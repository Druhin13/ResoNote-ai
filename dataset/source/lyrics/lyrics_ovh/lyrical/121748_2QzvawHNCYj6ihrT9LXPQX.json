I ain't even grown yet\n\nBaby, you got too much to offer\n\nThat’s prolly why they want you in a coffin\n\nBaby you're too young to sink it all in\n\nDamn\n\n\n\nPardon me, L-O-R-D\n\nWhy's it so hard out here for niggas like me?\n\nPardon me, L-O-R-D\n\nWhy's it so hard out here for niggas like me?\n\n\n\nI know I ain't been the easiest to deal with\n\nAs of late\n\nTwenty-two, with a lot on my plate\n\nBut you never know when you gotta go\n\nSometimes I can't wait\n\n\n\nPardon me, L-O-R-D\n\nWhy's it so hard out here for niggas like me?\n\nPardon me, L-O-R-D\n\nWhy's it so hard out here for niggas like me?"
