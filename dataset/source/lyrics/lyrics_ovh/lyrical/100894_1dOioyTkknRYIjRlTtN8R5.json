  "lyrics": "Got the time, the inclination\r\nI have answered your invitation\r\nI'll be leaving in the morning\r\nWatch me go\r\nI don't know where the wind is blowing\n\nGot directions to where I'm going\n\nNothing's happened\n\nThat's the only thing I know\n\n\n\nDo it now, do it now\n\nWhile the vision is clear\n\nDo it now\n\nWhile the feeling is here\n\nIf you leave it too late\n\nIt could all disappear\n\nDo it now\n\nWhile your vision is clear\n\n\n\nDo-do\n\nDo-do-do\n\n\n\nI don't regret the steps I'm taking\n\nThe decision that I'm making\n\nIs the right one\n\nOr I'm never gonna know\n\n\n\nGot the time, the inclination\n\nI have answered your invitation\n\nI'll be leaving in the morning\n\nWatch me go\n\n\n\nSo do it now, do it now\n\nWhile your vision is clear\n\nDo it now\n\nWhile the feeling is here\n\nIf you leave it too late\n\nIt could all disappear\n\nSo do it now\n\nWhile your vision is clear\n\n\n\nDo-do\n\nDo-do-do"
