  "lyrics": "Space\r\nSpace\r\nWhy do your feet stick to the ground\r\nBut your head, instead floats like a balloon\r\nWe make no accidental sound\n\nAs your mind resigns, spit the truth\n\n\n\nSpace\n\nSpace\n\n\n\nLook at these cats they run the town\n\nTry to paint it red, still you get the blues\n\nA dusty a star that's fading out\n\nTake the stage, there's no time to lose\n\n\n\nI'll pick you up on the way to space\n\nI'll pick you up on the way to space\n\nI'll pick you up, pick you up take your breath away\n\n\n\nBig sky, lots of room\n\nI'm right there with you\n\nRoom for me, room for you\n\nWe're on our way to space\n\nOn the way to space\n\n\n\nSpace\n\nSpace\n\n\n\nI'll pick you up on the way to space\n\nI'll pick you up on the way to space\n\nI'll pick you up, pick you up take your breath away\n\n\n\nBig sky, lots of room\n\nI'm right there with you\n\nRoom for me, room for you\n\nWe're on our way to space\n\nOn the way to space\n\nBig sky, lots of room\n\nI'm right there with you\n\nRoom for me, room for you\n\nWe're on our way to space\n\nOn the way to space"
