  "lyrics": "I am not the one you know\r\nForget all you've carved in stone\r\nAll risk at enter is your own\r\nVanity, deeper than my bones\r\nMy blood has gone bad\n\nFuels a blind eye\n\nBut don't miss it now!\n\nEvery drop is (im)purely mine\n\n\n\nSo I call it out\n\nUnlock the door\n\nSee for yourself\n\nBy now I know it well\n\n\n\nDim now, the light has spread so far\n\nBalance: sign of a righteous heart?\n\nMy motives, they all are far gone\n\nCaught in a total dark\n\n\n\nI'm underwhelmed\n\nMy goodness folds\n\nUnder the faults\n\n(there's always more)\n\n\n\nSo come and know\n\nEvery fallen cell\n\nI do own\n\nBy now I know it well"
