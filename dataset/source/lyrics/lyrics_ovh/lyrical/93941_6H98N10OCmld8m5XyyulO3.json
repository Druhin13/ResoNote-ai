How's your daughter?\n\nMy girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father\n\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?\n\nI'ma name her Bonnie\n\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry\n\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\n\nI know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan\n\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\n\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man\n\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat\n\nAnyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back\n\nJust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan\n\n\n\nMy tea's gone cold\n\nI'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\n\nThe morning rain cloud touched my window\n\nAnd I can't see at all\n\nAnd even if I could it would all be gray\n\nI put your picture on my wall\n\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\n\n\nDear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, hope you have a chance\n\nI ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans\n\nIf you don't wanna to talk to me outside your concert\n\nYou didn't have to\n\nBut you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew\n\nThat's my little brother, man, he's only six years old\n\nWe waited in the blisterin' cold\n\nFor you, for four hours, and you just said, \"No\"\n\nThat's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol\n\nHe wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do\n\nI ain't that mad, though I just don't like being lied to\n\nRemember when we met in Denver?\n\nYou said if I'd write you, you would write back\n\nSee, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither\n\nHe used to always cheat on my mom and beat her\n\nI can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs\n\nSo when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on\n\n‘Cause I don't really got shit else\n\nSo that shit helps when I'm depressed\n\nI even got a tattoo of your name across the chest\n\nSometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds\n\nIt's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me\n\nSee, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it\n\nMy girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7\n\nBut she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does\n\nShe don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up\n\nYou gotta call me, man\n\nI'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose, sincerely yours, Stan\n\nP.S.: We should be together too\n\n\n\nMy tea's gone cold\n\nI'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\n\nThe morning rain cloud touched my window\n\nAnd I can't see at all\n\nAnd even if I could it would all be gray\n\nI put your picture on my wall\n\nIt reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\n\n\nAnd the story isn't over, but I have to tell the truth\n\nI know I couldn't do it justice, only one who could is you\n\nBecause I idolized you Marshall, and nobody understands\n\nMaybe I'm a little crazy, maybe I am just like Stan, damn"
