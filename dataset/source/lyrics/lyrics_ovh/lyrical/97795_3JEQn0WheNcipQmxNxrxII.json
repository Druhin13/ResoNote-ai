  "lyrics": "Since I haven't talked to you I dream about you, baby blues\r\nAnd wonder why you stopped getting high\r\nEven though we were just friends, I think of us as bookends\r\nAnd I'm gonna love you till I die\n\nAnd you think you're going to heaven\n\nAnd that I am going to hell\n\nAnd that I'm gonna keep on dancing\n\nTill I hear that ringing bell\n\n\n\nHeads gonna roll\n\nBaby, everybody's gotta pay that toll\n\n\n\nAnd maybe after all is said and done\n\nWe'll all be skulls\n\n\n\nHeads gonna roll\n\n\n\nTook a little trip up north\n\nIn a borrowed convertible red Porsche\n\nWith a narcoleptic poet from Duluth\n\n\n\nAnd we disagreed about everything\n\nFrom Elliott Smith to grenadine\n\n\n\nHe fell asleep and I put up the roof\n\nAnd he took me to a graveyard\n\nI thought he'd kill me there\n\nAnd he kissed me on the corner\n\nWhile the nuns of Harlem stared\n\n\n\nOh, heads gonna roll\n\nBaby, everybody's gotta pay that toll\n\nAnd maybe after all is said and done\n\nWe'll all be skulls\n\nHeads gonna roll\n\n\n\nSmoking Marlboro cigarettes\n\nAlmost makes me forget about riding on a private jet with you\n\nI hope the sycophants in Marrakesh\n\nMake you feel your best\n\nAnonymity must make you feel blue\n\nAnd you think I'm going to heaven and you are going to hell\n\nWith your back to the Medina as if you were in jail\n\n\n\nHeads gonna roll\n\nBaby, everybody's gotta pay that toll\n\nAnd maybe after all is said and done\n\nWe'll all be skulls\n\n\n\nHeads gonna roll\n\nLadies, we're gonna drink until they close\n\n\n\nAnd maybe a little bit of hooking up is good for the soul\n\nHeads gonna roll"
