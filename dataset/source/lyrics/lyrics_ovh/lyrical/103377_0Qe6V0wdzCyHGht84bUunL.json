  "lyrics": "Amoral but not evil\r\nSick of fake democracies\r\nNo one will fuck the ugly robot\r\nSamael owns history\r\nMy thinking is done by your machine\n\nCan't escape the 20th century\n\nHanding in my resignation\n\nAt the ministry of alienation\n\n\n\nNot heaven just California\n\nEscape with you or from it all\n\nTerraform a hostile wasteland\n\nLike the rapture in reverse\n\n\n\nMy thinking is done by your machine\n\nCan't escape the 20th century\n\nHanding in my resignation\n\nAt the ministry of alienation"
