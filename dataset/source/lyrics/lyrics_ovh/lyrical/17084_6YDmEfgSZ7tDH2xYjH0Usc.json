  "lyrics": "Long in tooth, olives and vermouth\r\nI dine like an aging pilot\r\nWhere are they now, the money and the crowd?\r\nMust I really come back down?\r\nIt's like I never was a kid, the big math just wasted youth on me\n\nMaking impressions like I did, your friends never thought that much of me\n\nAnd now I want to fall into something else\n\nAn origami plane to a distant island\n\nAnd I don't want to show you my feelings\n\nI don't want to force you to deal\n\nI just want to crash through the ceiling\n\nBefore it gets too real\n\n\n\nAll my life, compromise on wings of resignation\n\nBig grey eyes staring from the sky\n\nAm I humble enough now?\n\nI've always had something to hide\n\nMy skinny arms, my evil intentions\n\nAnd back at school, hitting the fire alarms\n\nDesperately wanting attention\n\n\n\nWell I was just a boy\n\nOut there on my own\n\nWishing I could fly\n\nFantasy Island\n\nAnd I don't want to show you my feelings\n\nI don't want to bore you to death\n\nI just want to crash through the ceiling\n\nGet it off my chest\n\n\n\nIt's like I never was a kid, the big math, it wasted youth on me\n\nMaking impressions like I did, your friends never thought that much of me\n\nWell I was just a boy\n\nOut there on my own\n\nWishing I could fly\n\nFantasy Island\n\nAnd I don't want to show you my feelings\n\nI don't want to force you to deal\n\nI just want to crash through the ceiling\n\nBefore it gets too real\n\nBefore it gets too real\n\nBefore it gets too real\n\nReal, oh, oh, oh\n\nReal"
