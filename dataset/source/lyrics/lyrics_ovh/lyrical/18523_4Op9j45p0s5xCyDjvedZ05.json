That's parents for you\n\nVery loyal?\n\nShoulda had my back, but you put a knife into my hands before\n\nWhat else should I carry for you?\n\nI cared for you, but\n\n\n\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\n\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nL-l-let you down\n\nAll these voices in my head get loud\n\nI wish that I could shut them out\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nL-l-let you down\n\n\n\nYeah, you don't wanna make this work\n\nYou just wanna make this worse\n\nWant me to listen to you\n\nBut you don't ever hear my words\n\nYou don't wanna know my hurt, yet\n\nLet me guess you want an apology, probably\n\nHow can we keep going at a rate like this?\n\nWe can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave\n\nPlease don't come after me\n\nI just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all\n\nGo ahead, just drink it off\n\nBoth know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong\n\nAin't that what you always do?\n\nI feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood\n\nWhat else can I offer you?\n\nThere's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you\n\n\n\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\n\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nL-l-let you down\n\nAll these voices in my head get loud\n\nI wish that I could shut them out\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nL-l-let you down\n\n\n\nYeah, don't talk down to me\n\nThat's not gonna work now\n\nPacked all my clothes and I moved out\n\nI don't even wanna go to your house\n\nEverytime I sit on that couch\n\nI feel like you lecture me\n\nEventually, I bet that we\n\nCould have made this work\n\nAnd probably woulda figured things out\n\nBut I guess that I'm a letdown\n\nBut it's cool, I checked out\n\nOh, you wanna be friends now?\n\nOkay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now\n\nSit around and talk about the good times\n\nThat didn't even happen\n\nI mean, why are you laughing?\n\nMust have missed that joke\n\nLet me see if I can find a reaction\n\nNo, but at least you're happy\n\n\n\nFeels like we're on the edge right now\n\nI wish that I could say I'm proud\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nOh, I let you down\n\nAll these voices in my head get loud\n\nAnd I wish that I could shut them out\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nOh, let you down\n\n\n\nI'm sorry\n\nI'm so sorry now\n\nI'm sorry\n\nThat I let you down"
