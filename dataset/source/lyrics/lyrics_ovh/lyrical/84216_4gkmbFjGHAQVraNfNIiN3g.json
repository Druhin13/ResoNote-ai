  "lyrics": "If you open the book, turn the page, take a look\r\nFind the truth right between the lines\r\nRead the story in one, how it all just begun\r\nWell, admit it's one of a kind\r\nGiving protection with love and affection\r\nStanding with honor and pride\n\nEvery now, every then, will be always the same\n\nBorn to follow, walk a fine line\n\n\n\nYou're born into this world\n\nTo believe in mankind's destiny\n\nMarching on the path of glory\n\nWhen misery is all you see\n\nAll you need lies in your faith\n\nAnd until your dying breath\n\nYou are lost and lonely\n\n\n\nUnder fire and attack\n\nYou hear a neverending battle cry\n\nThe unsung hero stands alone\n\nWaiting for the day to die\n\nYou are thunder and you're pain\n\nYou're the keeper of the flame\n\nAs you sacrifice\n\n\n\nWarrior\n\nSave a life, save a soul, fight for freedom\n\nWarrior\n\nHere you stand with no fear\n\nWarrior\n\nTake me home, take my soul, give us freedom\n\nWarrior\n\nI can shed no more tears\n\n\n\nYou know, we'll never find some peace\n\nAs long as there are burning fires\n\nOnly chaos everywhere\n\nWhy don't we stick to our own heart's desires?\n\nWhen thunder meets the rain\n\nIt's time and again to sacrifice\n\n\n\nWarrior\n\nSave a life, save a soul, fight for freedom\n\nWarrior\n\nHere you stand with no fear\n\nWarrior\n\nTake me home, take my soul, give us freedom\n\nWarrior\n\nI can shed no more tears\n\n\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior\n\nWarrior"
