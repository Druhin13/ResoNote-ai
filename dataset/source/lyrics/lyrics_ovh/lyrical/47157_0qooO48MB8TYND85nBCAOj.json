She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watching her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? \"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it.\" She replied, \"Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost your life\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it wickedness?\n\n\n\nLamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song quote, \"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fosho...\"\n\nOh please, ugh, I don't like it"
