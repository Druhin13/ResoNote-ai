  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson U & Us par Quinn XCII\r\nI lie here restless like lines for a guest list\nWaiting for your message, I call out your name\nBut nobody answers, we spiral like dancers\nI'll write you these last words to say\n\nI'm begging, begging, begging you to please don't go\nI don't wanna see you be with someone else\nDon't make me drive at night in Hollywood as evenings go\nI don't wanna put what we had on the shelf\n\nI only want you and us\nI only want you and us\nI only want you to trust\nI only want you and us, and us, and us\n\n\nI'm waiting for something to make me feel something\nBut nothing fills nothing like we used to be\nRemember, remember when we said forever\nWe locked it and we lost the key\n\nI'm begging, begging, begging you to please don't go\nI don't wanna see you be with someone else\nDon't make me drive at night in Hollywood as evenings go\nI don't wanna put what we had on the shelf\n\nI only want you and us\nI only want you and us\nI only want you to trust\nI only want you and us, and us, and us\n\n\nOh, I don't wanna be lonely\nOh, I just want you to hold me down\nOh, I don't wanna be lonely\nOh, I just wanna be alone with you\n\nI only want you and us\nI only want you and us\nI only want you to trust\nI only want you and us, and us, and us"
