  "lyrics": "You know it is twelve o'clock in Soho, baby\r\nIt's gin o'clock where I wake up, I don't know\r\nAnd I think about you, lo, everywhere I go\r\nAnd I've done everythin' and I've been everywhere, you know\r\nI've been fed gold by sweet fools in Abu Dhabi\n\nAnd I've danced real slow with Rockettes on Dodge and Molly\n\n\n\nBut I've had no love like your love, ooh, I'm nobody\n\nI'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint\n\nI wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave\n\nBut I want you to know that I've had no love like your love\n\n\n\nHoney, when you warm the bed on Wednesday\n\nIt's suicide Tuesday back in LA\n\nIf I had the choice between here and Illinois\n\nExcitement of a thousand dollars turnin' up your voice\n\n\n\nAt first chance, I'd take the bed warmed by the body, woo\n\nI once warmed my hands over a burnin' Maserati, woo\n\n\n\nStill I've had no love like your love from nobody\n\nI'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint\n\nI wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave\n\nBut I want you to know that I've had no love like your love\n\nAnd on the other side, why should we deny the truth?\n\nWe could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you\n\nBut everything I do, I've had no love like your love"
