  "lyrics": "My eyes see through the lies\r\nAnd I see the wolves among the sheep\r\nI smell the fear inside\r\nAnd the odor brings me to my knees\r\nI'm at the end of my rope hanging on\n\nThese scars are dragging on my soul\n\nAnd we won't let go\n\nWe could live forever if we just let go now\n\n\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand strong to the winds of adversity\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand your ground\n\nAnd no, we won't go\n\nNo marching orders, get up off of your knees, now\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand your ground\n\n\n\nI crawl on to the pyre\n\nAnd the flames they purify my pain\n\nI'm writhing in desire\n\nAll this hatred has been all in vain\n\n\n\nHave you ever been the hated one\n\nFace to face with the flaws upon your soul\n\nLet the truth unfold\n\nWe could live forever if we just let go now\n\n\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand strong to the winds of adversity\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand your ground\n\nAnd no, we won't go\n\nNo marching orders, get up off of your knees, now\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand your ground\n\n\n\nI will prevail\n\nAnd I've been running from the long arm of the law\n\nI've got to live for better days\n\nThis depression that's inside of me\n\nIt eats away at the bones that are supporting me\n\nI have to fight back or get knocked down\n\nTake my hand and never let me drown\n\n\n\nSo tell me have you ever been the hated one\n\nFace to face with the flaws upon your soul\n\nLet the truth unfold\n\nWe could live forever if we just let go now\n\n\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand strong to the winds of adversity\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand your ground\n\nAnd no, we won't go\n\nFuck their orders, get up off of your knees, now\n\nHope begets hope\n\nStand your ground\n\n\n\nFace, the flaws on your soul\n\nLet, the truth unfold\n\nWe're gonna live forever"
