  "lyrics": "Never caught a fear in a fist fight, got a couple accolades\r\nThat is not one of them, blacking out to Budgie\r\nOn the kick drum however is, made some notables\r\nWorth remembering, dilated emblems\r\nIf the wind blows you'll find me floating\r\nEverything's slow motion when I'm smoking\n\nThe smell is potent, life is vibrant, still shining, everything timing\n\nI'll be at the shore, no vacation\n\nOn a tour saying color combination\n\nI met some people, we started talking\n\nThey said stop, youse a dead man walking\n\nIt's not a clich√©, but this is take one\n\nMake it great, it don't matter if you take long\n\nI don't take shorts, I don't steal shirts\n\nI only got good, I don't deal dirt\n\nI'm a simple man, not a simpleton\n\nFeatures of a God I'm resembling\n\nThink fast, talk slow, when it's check out I'll see you at the cross roads\n\nThink fast, talk slow, when it's check out I'll see you at the cross roads\n\nThink fast, talk slow\n\n\n\nMary Holmes drop kick off the limo\n\nFull coverage box checked on the rental\n\nLeft on ten, truck left hella full of cans rattling\n\nAdvertisers taking up prime space we're battling\n\nStreet on tour is a trust fund traffic\n\nThey love to feel the edge they heard the history's graphic\n\nAll of a sudden it's [?] beards, ironic tattoos, classic architecture, iconic statues\n\nGlass ceiling, use the custom model, peek-a-boo\n\nSending lefts and rights through, taking you to flight school\n\nChief corner stone, cap stone view\n\nIlluminating manuscripts to rap's glow too\n\nCrazy felt life, Gracie felt stripes\n\nLow key stealth trying to keep my health right\n\nBullet and proof closer, fake news moving hate\n\nIt's a new day, the sun shine and illuminate\n\nBullet and proof closer, fake news moving hate\n\nIt's a new day, the sun shine and illuminate\n\nBullet and proof closer, fake news moving hate"
