  "lyrics": "Angels fell, fell and died\r\nYet still remain those chains of you and I\r\nSacred saints, all crucified\r\nWhere is that hidden key they could not find?\r\nI always pray, the heavens cry\r\nWhen fathers fail, the children â€“ will they rise?\n\nDarkness reigns and we are the slaves of that all knowing eye"
