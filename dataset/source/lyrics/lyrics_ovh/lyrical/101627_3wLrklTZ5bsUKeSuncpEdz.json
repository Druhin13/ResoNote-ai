  "lyrics": "Sittin' on the front step\r\nLittle white suitcase\r\nHearing that diesel\r\nFore it hit the front gate\r\nHis headlights burnin' down a Friday night\n\nSouthern Belle statue\n\nStanding in the screen door\n\nWatching her whole world\n\nHead for an old Ford\n\nWith a man that can't look her in the eye\n\n\n\nSo I run, to him\n\nBig hug, jump in\n\nAnd I cry for her\n\nOut the window\n\n\n\nSome mommas and daddies \n\nAre loving in a straight line\n\nTake forever to heart \n\nAnd take a long sweet ride\n\nBut some mommas and daddies \n\nLet their heart strings tear and tangle\n\nAnd some of us get stuck\n\nIn a love triangle\n\n\n\nBowling alley burger\n\nFries and a milkshake\n\nHeading to the same old\n\nTwo-dollar matinee\n\nBaby, how's your school been, \n\nand how's your mom?'\n\n\n\nPatsy Cline echoes\n\nBack off the dashboard\n\nStaring at my boots \n\nAnd the dusty old floorboards\n\nBaby, two weeks ain't really all that long\n\n\n\nSo I run, to her\n\nWrap my arms, around her skirt\n\nAnd I cry for him\n\nOut the window\n\n\n\nSome mommas and daddies \n\nAre loving in a straight line\n\nTake forever to heart \n\nAnd take a long sweet ride\n\nBut some mommas and daddies \n\nLet their heart strings tear and tangle\n\nAnd some of us get stuck\n\nIn a love triangle\n\n\n\nOooooh Oooooh\n\n\n\nIn a love triangle\n\n\n\nOooooh Oooooh\n\n\n\nSome mommas and daddies \n\nAre loving in a straight line\n\nTake forever to heart \n\nAnd take a long sweet ride\n\nBut some mommas and daddies \n\nLet their heart strings tear and tangle, oh\n\n\n\nAnd some mommas and daddies\n\nRan outta love in 94\n\nAnd some mommas and daddies\n\nDon't even talk no more\n\nAnd some mommas and daddies \n\nLet their heart strings tear and tangle\n\n\n\nAnd some of us get stuck\n\nAnd some of us grow up\n\nIn a love triangle"
