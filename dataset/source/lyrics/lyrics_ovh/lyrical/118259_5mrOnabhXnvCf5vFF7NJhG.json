I'm the god, nigga\n\nI'm so sorry, check that shawty, she's a gold digger\n\n\n\nAye, I don't give a fuck, never cleaning up\n\nBitch my blood is mud, never clean it up\n\nEnter the chamber of love, set it on fire and run\n\nBitch, I'm a slut when it come to the drugs\n\nI was sent here to get fucked up and then die\n\nYou don't want me bitch and if you say you do then you lyin'\n\nI ain't a socialite, I'm staying home tonight\n\nMaybe another line, shawty give me dome, I'm high\n\nNever thinking with a sober mind\n\nSo I might guess that she left me for the same reason she loved me\n\nStole her fucking pills and now she don't trust me\n\nSlapped me across my face, she said Ruby you disgusting\n\nBaby girl, I got money, ain't no need for discussing\n\nTold me never call her back and I don't think she bluffin'\n\n\n\nTell me that she wanna ride me through the night then call me back\n\nI like how she riding 'cause she take that shit all in that back\n\nI got bands in my pants and I'm dancing\n\nI'm like man, you a fan, why you snapping?\n\nOn the place, so I'm like baby, you my Novocaine\n\nI don't even know you, swear to god, bitch, how you know my name?\n\nI'm like damn, why you mad? I'm the god nigga\n\nI'm so sorry, check that shawtyâ€“\n\n\n\nYuh, yuh, cradle to the grey, I cradle in my grave\n\nFlick your ash, brain on drugs, I can't get no peace of mind\n\nI can't lie it fucking hurts, 'cause I was designed to shine\n\nNow I'm popping bars, 'til my brain fogs, drop like a phone line\n\nDon't speak, we just squeeze, bitch on her knees\n\nHelp me put my mind at ease, begging to god I don't believe\n\nGive me relief, on this grief\n\nNo sleep, I can't eat\n\nThe light getting dimmer and dimmer\n\nCall me selfish, blow my brains out now I'm gone forever"
