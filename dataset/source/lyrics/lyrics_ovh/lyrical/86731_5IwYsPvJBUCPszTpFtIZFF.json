  "lyrics": "You're a secret that I keep tight, close to my chest\r\nTo tell the truth, you know you got me at my best\r\nJust so you know, I think about you all the time\r\nCause you're a see through, and you're all mine\r\nWhy can't you just make this easy?\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\nOut of sight, but you're on my mind\n\nI got breath, because you're right on time\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\n\n\nI'm feeling bad, I know it's wrong, but it's the truth\n\nI was feeling bored, but to me it was kind of an escape\n\nJust so you know, I don't think that it's such a crime\n\nIf you can keep a secret, then you're all mine\n\n\n\nWhy can't you just make this easy?\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\nOut of sight, but you're on my mind\n\nI got breath, because you're right on time\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're a secret that I keep tight, close to my chest\n\nTo tell the truth, you know you got me at my best\n\nJust so you know, I think about you all the time\n\nCause you're a see through, and you're all mine\n\n\n\nWhy can't you just make this easy?\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\nOut of sight, but you're on my mind\n\nI got breath, because you're right on time\n\nYou got me you got me high\n\nYou got me you got me high"
