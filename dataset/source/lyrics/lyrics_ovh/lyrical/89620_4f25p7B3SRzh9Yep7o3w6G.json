  "lyrics": "I tied myself with wire\r\nTo let the horses run free\r\nPlaying with the fire until the fire played with me\r\nYeah\r\nAnd the stone was semi-precious\n\nWe were barely conscious\n\nTwo souls too smart to be in the realm of certainty\n\nEven on our wedding day\n\n\n\nWe set ourselves on fire\n\nOh God, do not deny her\n\nAnd it's not if I believe in love\n\nBut if love believes in me\n\nCome on and believe in me\n\n\n\nAt the moment of surrender\n\nI folded to my knees\n\nI did not notice the passers-by\n\nAnd they did not notice me\n\n\n\nI have been in every black hole\n\nAt the altar of the dark star\n\nAnd my body's now a begging bowl\n\nAnd it's begging to get back\n\nBegging to get back to my heart\n\nTo the rhythm of my soul\n\nTo the rhythm of my unconsciousness\n\nTo the rhythm that yearns\n\nTo be released from control\n\n\n\nAnd I was punching in the numbers\n\nAt the ATM machine\n\nI could see in the reflection\n\nA face staring back at me\n\n\n\nAt the moment of surrender\n\nOf vision over visibility\n\nI did not notice the passers-by\n\nAnd they did not notice me\n\n\n\nI was speeding on the subway\n\nThrough the stations of the cross\n\nEvery eye looking every other way\n\nCounting down till the pain would stop\n\n\n\nAt the moment of surrender\n\nI folded to my knees\n\nI did not notice the passers-by\n\nAnd they did not notice me"
