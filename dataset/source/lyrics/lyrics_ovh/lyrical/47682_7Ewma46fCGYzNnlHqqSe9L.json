  "lyrics": "Out in darkness I was crawling\r\nYou had moonlight hiding under your skin and\r\nIn your pockets and laying on your bed\r\nI stepped lightly through your bedroom\r\nYou beside me, we were talking alone\n\nOver the shots from the thought guns in our heads\n\n\n\nAnd the world was moving much more slowly than it is now\n\nI didn't know what I was doing but god\n\nI knew more than what I know now\n\n\n\nNow to your house I go running\n\nA man comes out and says you're long gone\n\nWell now I was hoping to find you and\n\nForget about this losing streak I'm on\n\n\n\nNow to your house I go running\n\nA man comes out and says you're long gone\n\nWell now I was hoping to find you and\n\nForget about this losing streak I'm on"
