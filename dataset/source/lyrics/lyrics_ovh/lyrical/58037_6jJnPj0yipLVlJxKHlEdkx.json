  "lyrics": "I can feel the ravens looking\r\nThere is dust in my eyes\r\nThere is a body in the coffin\r\nIt is too warm for the cure\r\nThere's a mirror in the casket\n\nI can see my future there\n\nCan I be the last man standing?\n\nOr give in and jump the fence\n\n\n\nWhen I disappear, can I have it like this?\n\nKnocked down in the covenant bliss\n\nKeep the change, don't need it when I go\n\nI pay the piper at the funeral show\n\n\n\nLet me hang from the gallow\n\nLet me be the one who's next\n\nLet me be the one who's sleeping\n\nI come back as the guest\n\n\n\nWhen I disappear, can I have it like this?\n\nKnocked down in the covenant bliss\n\nKeep the change, don't need it when I go\n\nI pay the piper at the funeral show"
