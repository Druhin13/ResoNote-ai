  "lyrics": "Weightlessness, no gravity\r\nWere we somewhere in-between?\r\nI’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me\r\nA bird’s-eye view of San Luis, mmm\r\nOh, highway boys all sleeping in\n\nWith their dirty mouths and broken strings\n\nOh, their eyes are shining like the sea\n\nFor you, the queen of San Luis\n\nI’m a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me\n\nA bird’s-eye view of San Luis\n\n\n\nCutting through the avenues\n\nI'd always find my way to you\n\nBeside the hook, the hammer lies\n\nAnd fumbling round in the smoke\n\nSpending time chasing ghosts\n\nHold me down, hold me down, child\n\nHold me down, hold me down, child\n\n\n\nCalifornia called you queen\n\nWith your golden hair and magazine\n\nWere you somewhere in-between?\n\nFast asleep, a flying dream\n\n\n\nI'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me\n\nA bird’s-eye view of San Luis\n\nI'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me\n\nA bird’s-eye view of San Luis\n\nI'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me\n\nA bird’s-eye view of San Luis\n\nI'm a ghost of you, you’re a ghost of me\n\nA bird’s-eye view of San Luis"
