  "lyrics": "You look at me, you see her face\r\nNo, you don’t like me, I’m just there to hold her place\r\nI fall asleep, head on your chest\r\nBut I wake up on the other side of the bed\r\nHope I distract you enough\n\nFrom the girl that you love\n\nCause I been doin’ the same\n\nYou’re just a boy that I *gasp*\n\nI hope that wasn’t too much\n\nBut boy I don’t give a fuck\n\nThat’s what I’m telling myself\n\nSo that I don’t get caught up on you\n\nCaught up on you\n\n\n\nI hope I keep her side of the bed warm\n\nIf that’s the only thing that you been keepin’ me around for\n\nWon’t say how we’re feeling cause we’re unsure\n\nBut we love playing this game of who can care less more\n\n\n\nWho can care less, who can care less more\n\nIt’s a contest, who do we care less for?\n\nWho can care less, who can care less more\n\nIt’s a contest, of who can care less more\n\n\n\nYou stole the sheets, I stole em back\n\nThought I was cold, but I can be colder than that\n\nThat’s why I leave, keep all my makeup\n\nSo that I’m gone before the morning when you wake up\n\n\n\nHope I distract you enough\n\nFrom the girl that you love\n\nCause I been doin’ the same\n\nYou’re just a boy that I *gasp*\n\nCause baby I’m just too much\n\nFor you to do more than fuck\n\nThat’s what you’re telling yourself\n\nSo that you don’t get caught up on me\n\nCaught up on me\n\n\n\nI hope I keep her side of the bed warm\n\nIf that’s the only thing that you been keepin’ me around for\n\nWon’t say how we’re feeling cause we’re unsure\n\nBut we love playing this game of who can care less more\n\n\n\nWho can care less, who can care less more\n\nIt’s a contest, who do we care less for?\n\nWho can care less, who can care less more\n\nIt’s a contest, of who can care less more\n\n\n\nWhy you wastin’ all of your time layin’ next to me?\n\nIf you really wanted her so bad, that’s where you’d be\n\nWhy you wastin’ all of your time busy textin’ me?\n\nIf you don’t want what’s best for me"
