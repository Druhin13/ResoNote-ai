  "lyrics": "Look Ma, the wind stopped blowing\r\nAnd I see that that means nothing\r\nThere's more to a storm\r\nAnd all the wires are down\r\nAnd there is not a sound\r\nBut I pray, just for today\n\n\n\nLook Ma, I ain't done growing\n\nMy blind eyes are slowly opening up again\n\nSun overhead\n\nBy now denial is breaking\n\nI'm over the fake love making\n\nAs a way of quick escape\n\n\n\nThrough the chaos and the calm\n\nFound some comfort in the harm\n\nAnd I fall apart\n\n\n\nLook Ma, some winds still blowing\n\nI'm over pretending knowing it all\n\nAs I hit the floor\n\n\n\nIt's gonna be a long long day\n\nLooking for a long long winter\n\nPlanning on an easy way\n\nTo get around the whole thing quicker\n\n\n\nTrick of the mind for a minute\n\nWas only lying to myself\n\nPushing my luck to the limit\n\nPutting the poison on the shelf\n\nYeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah"
