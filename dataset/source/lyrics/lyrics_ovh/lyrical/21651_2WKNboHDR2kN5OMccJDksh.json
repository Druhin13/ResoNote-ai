  "lyrics": "You've fallen captive to what you thought would save you,\r\nwhat you thought would clean your slate. \nYou're in the thick of it now and you have swallowed the hook. \nWhat's done is done. \nWe'll continue on with or without you.\r\nPain must exist in order for healing to survive. \n\nNeither one will ever serve their purpose alone. \n\nYou've fallen in love with a dream you've never had. \n\nYou've fallen in love with a surreal way of living. \n\nTo late to wake, farewell and good luck to you.\n\nSee you at the end. \n\nToo late to wake, to lay too waste. \n\nI'm throwing in the towel. \n\nThis is my goodbye. \n\nDon't worry.\n\nWe saw through your trickery, and were coming out alive. \n\nSee you at the end. \n\nWhat was once your life is now lifeless.\n\nWhat was once your life is now your jail cell"
