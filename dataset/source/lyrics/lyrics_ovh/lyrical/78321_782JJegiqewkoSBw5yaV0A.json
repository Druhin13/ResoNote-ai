  "lyrics": "They say times are hard for dreamers\r\nBut they won't be hard for me\r\nI've saved up everything I know\r\nTo take that step beyond the lawn\r\nKeep walking till I see the station\r\nAnd then see it go\n\n\n\nInside the train, up through the glass\n\nMy finger tracing\n\nAll of these towns I've never heard of racing past\n\nOff the train in Paris, half a mile from Sacré-Cœur\n\nThe city's waking up for me!\n\nA sign says an apartment's vacant on the second floor!\n\nAnd suddenly I hold a key\n\n\n\nI turn a lock, the rooms appear\n\nAnd all it takes is one more step, and then I'm here!\n\nJust me behind my door!\n\nIt isn't what I have, it's only what I have in store\n\nThat matters now, the past can only fade!\n\nAnd everything I'll ever need is here\n\nThis is how my world gets made\n\n\n\nThey say times are hard for dreamers\n\nAnd who knows, maybe they are\n\nPeople seem stuck, or lost at sea!\n\nAnd I might be a dreamer\n\nBut it's gotten me this far\n\nAnd that is far enough for me\n\n\n\nLook out my window there's a view, of other windows\n\nMy own museum full of paintings I look through!\n\nWhere everything is clear!\n\nIt isn't where I am, it's only where I'll go from here\n\nThat matters now\n\nAnd I am not afraid!\n\nAs everything I'll ever need appears\n\nThis is how my world gets made"
