But I can't\n\nIt's like I'm standing at the bottom of a hole\n\nWith the shovel in my hand\n\n\n\nI'm way too good at faking it\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like\n\nI don't want nobody else\n\nI even started fooling myself\n\nI'm way too good at\n\n\n\nBeing a zombie when we're in the bedroom\n\n(Iâ€™m way too good at)\n\nDoing the things I don't really want to\n\n\n\n(I know, I know) I should leave\n\n(Should I let go?) But I can't\n\nIt's like I'm standing at the bottom of a hole\n\nWith the shovel in my hand\n\n\n\nI'm just way too good at faking it\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like\n\nI don't want nobody else\n\nI even started fooling myself\n\nI'm way too good at faking it\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like\n\nI don't want nobody else\n\nI even started fooling myself\n\n'Cause I'm way too good at faking it\n\n\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like I love you\n\nMaking it look like I want to\n\nBe here when I'm already gone\n\nI should've told you all along\n\nBut you're not the one\n\nBabe, I'm already done\n\n\n\nI'm just way too good at faking it\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like\n\nI don't want nobody else\n\nI even started fooling myself\n\nI'm way too good at faking it\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like\n\nI don't want nobody else\n\nI even started fooling myself\n\n'Cause I'm way too good at faking it\n\nI'm way too good at making it look like\n\nI don't want nobody else\n\nI even started fooling myself\n\n'Cause I'm way too good at faking it\n\n\n\nI'm way too good at"
