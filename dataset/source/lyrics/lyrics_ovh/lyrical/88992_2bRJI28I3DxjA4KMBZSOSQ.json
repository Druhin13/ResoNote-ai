  "lyrics": "Sunlight\r\nAin't it good to feel alright\r\nAin’t it good to know that you're not alone\r\nYeah ain't it good to know\r\nCause I lived my whole life\r\nLooking for the light with closed eyes\n\nAin’t it funny how you fight what you need the most\n\nYeah, but I can finally feel my soul tonight\n\n\n\nI've got this wonderful feeling\n\nI've got my hopes set high\n\nAnd after all this time spent chasing my shadow\n\nLet Your light be mine\n\nLet Your light be mine\n\nCome on sunlight prove the darkness wrong\n\nAin't it funny how the fears we had last night\n\nDon't look so scary in the morning light\n\nCome on flowers open up your arms\n\nAin't it good to finally step into that light\n\nYeah and I can feel it in my soul tonight\n\nLike a waterfall\n\nWashing over my shadows\n\nLike a waterfall\n\nI'm under now\n\nLet your waterfall and\n\nLet your all of Your love pour down"
