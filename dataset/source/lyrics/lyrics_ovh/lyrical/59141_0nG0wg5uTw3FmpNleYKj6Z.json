  "lyrics": "Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, \ndrifting through the wind \nwanting to start again? \nDo you ever feel, feel so paper thin \nlike a house of cards, \none blow from caving in? \n\n\n\nDo you ever feel already buried deep? \n\n6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing \n\nDo you know that there's still a chance for you \n\n'Cause there's a spark in you \n\n\n\nYou just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine \n\nJust own the night like the 4th of July \n\n\n\n'Cause baby you're a firework \n\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth \n\nMake 'em go \"Oh, oh, oh\" \n\nAs you shoot across the sky-y-y \n\n\n\nBaby, you're a firework \n\nCome on, let your colors burst \n\nMake 'em go \"Oh, oh, oh\" \n\nYou're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe!\n\n\n\nYou don't have to feel like a waste of space \n\nYou're original, cannot be replaced \n\nIf you only knew what the future holds \n\nAfter a hurricane comes a rainbow \n\n\n\nMaybe a reason why all the doors are closed \n\nSo you could open one that leads you to the perfect road \n\nLike a lightning bolt, your heart will glow \n\nAnd when it's time, you'll know \n\n\n\nYou just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine \n\nJust own the night like the 4th of July \n\n\n\n'Cause baby you're a firework \n\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth \n\nMake 'em go \"Oh, oh, oh\" \n\nAs you shoot across the sky-y-y \n\n\n\nBaby, you're a firework \n\nCome on, let your colors burst \n\nMake 'em go \"Oh, Oh, Oh\" \n\nYou're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe , awe!\n\n\n\nBoom, boom, boom \n\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon \n\nIt's always been inside of you, you, you \n\nAnd now it's time to let it through-ough-ough \n\n\n\n'Cause baby you're a firework \n\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth \n\nMake 'em go \"Oh, Oh, Oh\" \n\nAs you shoot across the sky-y-y \n\n\n\nBaby, you're a firework \n\nCome on, let your colors burst \n\nMake 'em go \"Oh, Oh, Oh\" \n\nYou're gonna leave 'em awe, awe, awe!\n\n\n\nBoom, boom, boom \n\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon \n\nBoom, boom, boom \n\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon"
