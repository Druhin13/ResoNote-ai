What you quitting for?\r\nThey told me God gave me a mission, but I'm missing the supplies to complete it\r\nI ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated\n\nSo nigga, brother who you standing with?\n\nI'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this\n\nBrother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane\n\nThe feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain\n\nI'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire\n\nSituation is dire, hear them calls from the choir\n\nThe disposition acquired from my position on Earth\n\nIs telling me \"Decapitate everything for what it's worth!\"\n\nWhen I die, these words gon' need separate caskets in a hearse\n\nI don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work\n\nI'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth\n\nSee this canvas as I planned it, I'm commanding with my nerves\n\n\n\nTell 'em boys, don't run from us\n\nI been down too long, cousin\n\nI been down too long, brother\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of nothing\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of jumping\n\nTell my boy I want a crib in London\n\nTell the world to stop tripping out\n\nI'll build a different house with some different functions\n\nTell 'em boys, don't run from us\n\nI been down too long, cousin\n\nI been down too long, brother\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of nothing\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of jumping\n\nTell my boy, I want a crib in London\n\nTell the world to stop tripping out\n\nI'll build a different house with some different functions\n\n\n\nTry to treat man like baby\n\nFeel the teeth sink in like rabies\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\nBoy, you know you don't look fly\n\nThem gold chains turn your neck green, bye\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah, ah\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\n\n\nNothin' different now, all around now\n\nWho you keep around now? That's a big reflection\n\nDon't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?\n\nWear your shit upon your sleeve, so projectin' on me\n\nSense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?\n\nKill the ego now, what that make of me?\n\nAngle watch screen, couple sips of Tanqueray\n\nI'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway\n\n[Chin up] slide in like the macarena\n\nLose time, penne style spiced up, jalape√±o\n\nSupersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly savage\n\nGot better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor\n\nBustin' out the function, highly comfortable\n\nGot this hot ting on my body, man my sweat lethal\n\nSweet kisses like the candy out the carnival\n\nI'ma call my own shots, hit the audible\n\n\n\nImpending death is the only sign of life\n\nI'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die\n\nThrow it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up\n\nHave my wings clipped, I don't need them shits, learn to fly again\n\nFast track to last place, I swear I've never been up top\n\nBut I'm up here somewhere\n\nOut here, nobody can tell me shit\n\nShit, never mind what I did back then\n\nYou should take a look at yourself instead\n\nMaybe you can find yourself, love yourself\n\nHere's to health and here's to wealth, all together now\n\n\n\nTell 'em boys, don't run from us\n\nI been down too long, cousin\n\nI been down too long, brother\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of nothing\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of jumping\n\nTell my boy, I want a crib in London\n\nTell the world to stop tripping out\n\nI'll build a different house with some different functions\n\nTell 'em boys, don't run from us\n\nI been down too long, cousin\n\nI been down too long, brother\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of nothing\n\nTell the world, I ain't scared of jumping\n\nTell my boy, I want a crib in London\n\nTell the world to stop tripping out\n\nI'll build a different house with some different functions\n\n\n\nHoo! Voodoo Man\n\nMomma took me to the church and I sang a hymn\n\nCo-colonized Chris-ti-an\n\nNow I'm losing my reli-gi-on, yeah!\n\nGod damn, so narcissistic in this millennium\n\nFuck you and the bubble that you livin' in\n\nI don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual\n\nPulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle\n\nIf Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?\n\nAll these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day\n\nI'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?\n\nIf the service is an hour, I'm an hour late"
