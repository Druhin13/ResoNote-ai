  "lyrics": "Bird, you've so many hearts on your sleeve. \nOne for each feather, \nthough you never see, \nblue eyes blink bright lights \nthrough leaves on the trees \nfrom seeds that did grow where you sowed. \n\nYou'll never have nowhere to go. \n\nLook at this silver and gold, \n\nshook through a tangle of thorns. \n\nBird, we've so many days spent beside \n\nthis sulk of a river, \n\nnow we're deep down dyed \n\ninto the marrow, out with the tide, \n\nwith all that you have and I hold. \n\nYou'll never have nowhere to go. \n\nYour heart, it holds more than your hands, \n\nnot bought or sold, more than mountains. \n\nLook at this silver and gold. \n\nYou'll never have nowhere to go."
