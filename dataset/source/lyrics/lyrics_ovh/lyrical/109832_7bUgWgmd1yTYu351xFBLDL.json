  "lyrics": "I sit alone in the dark, and I try to remember\r\nThe words you spoke when you summoned the Ender\r\nYou chained my life to an ancient master\r\nWill the curse be reversed if I say it backwards?\r\nWhat you crossed was a line at the edge of the void\n\nAnd you can’t crawl back without making a choice\n\nBut then something escaped when you opened the gate\n\nYou cheated death and sealed your fate\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n1, 2, 3, 4\n\n\n\nPut on your new dress tonight\n\nAnd look to the west, the moon’s in the sky\n\nI wanna get at least that high\n\nWanna leave the Earth and my things behind\n\nYou told me you’re never gonna die\n\nHow am I supposed to sleep through the night?\n\nYou showed me the secret of life\n\nI can’t forget that look in your eye\n\n\n\nBeen a long time gone, living out on the coast\n\nIt’s a long way back from the edge of the cosmos\n\nTruths once known never come unknown\n\nI learned that lesson lives ago\n\nTo die for good, it must be earned\n\nThe ways of death can never be learned\n\nAnd the life I’ve lived is only dust\n\nThe darkness comes for all of us\n\n\n\nPut on your new dress tonight\n\nAnd I look to the west, the moon’s in the sky\n\nI wanna get at least that high\n\nWanna leave the Earth and all things behind\n\nYou told me you’re never gonna die\n\nHow am I supposed to sleep through the night?\n\nYou showed me the secret of life\n\nI can’t forget that look in your eye\n\n\n\nLa, da, da\n\nLa, da ,da"
