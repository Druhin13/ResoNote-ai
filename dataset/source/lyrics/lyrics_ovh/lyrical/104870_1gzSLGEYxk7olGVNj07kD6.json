  "lyrics": "Sitting in the dark all night fighting shadows,\r\nAnd the urge to call you up hits me like an arrow.\r\nIt ain't the whiskey talking or the loneliness I'm feeling.\r\nIt's the memories, all the little things, that keep me from healing.\r\nI'd give up all the days I got left on this earth,\n\n'Cause without you I don't know what they're worth; no.\n\n\n\nI'd give it all for you, if you'd let me.\n\nThis heart don't have a home without you in it; no.\n\nI'd stand before you, as a man who's been broken.\n\n\n\nIs that enough?\n\nIs that enough,\n\nFor your love?\n\n\n\nThe flame I keep inside burns through rainy nights,\n\nEven though I tried to put it out so many times.\n\nGood Book's on the table so I can get some advice\n\nWhen I can't rest my heavy head, 'cause I'm still lost in your eyes.\n\n\n\nI'd give up all the days I got left on this earth,\n\n'Cause without you I don't know what they're worth.\n\n\n\nAnd I'd give it all for you, if you'd let me.\n\nThis heart don't have a home without you in it; no.\n\nAnd I'd stand before you as a man who's been broken\n\nTruer words never spoken; no.\n\n\n\nIs that enough?\n\nIs that enough,\n\nFor your love?\n\n\n\nI'd give it all for you, if you'd let me.\n\nThis heart don't have a home without you in it; no.\n\nI'd stand before you, as a man who's been broken.\n\nTruer words never spoken; no.\n\n\n\nIs that enough?\n\nIs that enough?\n\nIs that enough?\n\nIs that enough,\n\nFor your love?"
