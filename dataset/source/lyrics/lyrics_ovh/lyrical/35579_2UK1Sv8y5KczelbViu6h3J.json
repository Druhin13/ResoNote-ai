  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Radi-Yum par Major Murphy\r\nMy heart is a nuclear chamber\nAnd my world is a little the same\nIt’s hard to keep re-arranging\nBut it’s no luck if I just stay the same\nI’ve found I’m way out in the noon-day sun\nRadi-Yum\nAnd it’s over now even before it has begun\nWell done\n\nDone up in molecular language\nThen shipped out in a boat on the sea\nBlood sweat & tears on the way\nBut just one smile by the time you’re with me\nIt’s practically faceless and you know what I mean, 17\nBetween you and me\n\nI’m as sorry as can be\nYeah, that’s me\n\nI’ve found I’m way out in the noon-day sun\nRadi-Yum\nAnd it’s over now even before it has begun\nWell done\n\nBy day I’m pushing up daisies\nBut by night I’m a luminous ray\nThe coast is clear but the water is hazy\nI’m all ears but you got nothing to say\nAll around me are these places where I don’t belong, move on\n‘Till I’m underground\nThen you wonder where I gone\nWell, I’m gone"
