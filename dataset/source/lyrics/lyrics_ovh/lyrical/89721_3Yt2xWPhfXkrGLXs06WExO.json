  "lyrics": "Everybody's singing the same song\r\nIt goes \"tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight\"\r\nI never realized these artists thought so much about dying\r\nBut truth be told we all have the same end\r\nCould make you cry, cry, cry, cry, cry\n\nBut I'm telling you\n\nThis is the best news you're getting all week\n\n\n\nOh sure it's ruling the airwaves\n\nWhat remains of the airwaves\n\nAnd we're frankly thankful for the market psychology you're hipping us to\n\n\n\nAnd all the hits are saying the same thing\n\nThere's only tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight\n\nAnd life is finite\n\nBut shit, it feels like forever\n\nIt feels like forever\n\n\n\nOh is everybody feeling the same stuff?\n\nWe're all wild\n\nExcept for you\n\nAnd you know who you are\n\nThis is a love song\n\n\n\nAnd you're getting older\n\nI promise you this; you're getting older\n\nAnd there's improvements unless\n\nYou're such a winner\n\nThat the future's a nightmare\n\nAnd there's nothing I can do\n\nNothing anyone can do about this\n\n\n\nAnd oh, I'm offering you a chance to get even\n\nBut oh, you know very well the dialect of negation\n\nSure enemies haunt you with spit and derision\n\nBut friends are the ones who can put you in an exile\n\nBut that's not right\n\n\n\nAnd you're too sharp to be used\n\nOr you're too shocked from being used\n\nBy these bullying children of the fabulous\n\nRaffling off limited edition shoes\n\n\n\nAnd what's it you do again?\n\nOh I'm a reminder\n\nThe hobbled veteran of the disk shop inquisition\n\nSet to parry the cocksure of men's sick filth\n\nWith my own late era middle-aged ramblings\n\nEvery lover favors the same things\n\nIt's all \"touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me tonight\"\n\nWe maybe realize what it is we need before we die\n\n\n\nAnd luck is always better than skill at things\n\nWe're flying blind\n\nOh good gracious\n\nI sound like my mom\n\n\n\nBut out of the little rooms and onto the streets\n\nYou've lost your internet and we've lost our memory\n\nWe had a paper trail that led to our secrets\n\nBut embarrassing pictures have now all been deleted\n\nBy versions of selves that we thought were the best ones\n\n'Till versions of versions of others repeating\n\nCome laughing at everything we thought was important\n\nWhile still making mistakes that you thought you had learned from\n\nAnd reasonable people know better than you\n\nThat cost in the long run but they don't know the short game\n\nAnd terrible people know better than you\n\nThey're used and abused of the once so dear listener\n\nSo you will be badgered and taunted and told that\n\nYou're missing a party that you'll never get over\n\nYou hate the idea that you're wasting your youth\n\nThat you stood in the background oh until you got older\n\nBut that's all lies\n\nThat's all lies\n\n\n\nIt's gonna have to be good enough, I can't do this anymore, my brain won't work"
