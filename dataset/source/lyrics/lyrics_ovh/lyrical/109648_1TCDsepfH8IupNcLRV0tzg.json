  "lyrics": "Weekends in bed, no scramble eggs, or bacon\r\nI just have time for you\r\nBacks on the grass, heads in the clouds, we closed our eyes\r\nEnjoy the view\r\nWe don't wanna hear\n\nThe real world passing by\n\nSaying that we're crazy\n\n\n\nWe spend all our time lying side by side\n\nGoing nowhere, it's really something\n\nGetting busy doing nothing\n\nWe spend all our time running for our lives\n\nGoing nowhere, it's really something\n\nGetting busy, doing nothing\n\n\n\nNo magazines or DVD's we both got\n\nBetter things to do\n\nI'll hold your hand\n\nOr shall we dance together\n\nIt's so hard to choose\n\n\n\nEvery time we hear\n\nThe whole world rushing by\n\nI know that we're not crazy\n\n\n\nShould be working hard\n\nInstead of lying here naked\n\nPhone rings but I won't take it\n\nCause you only get one life... only get one life"
