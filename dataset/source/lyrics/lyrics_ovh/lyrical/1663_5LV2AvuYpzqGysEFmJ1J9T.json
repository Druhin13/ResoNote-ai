  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ace Hood - Questions (Interlude) par Ace Hood\r\nLast night when I got up—we've been recording for like thirty minutes\nThat's—yeah\nSo what I, what I wanna\nWhat I wanna know is the last\nIt's a question I forgot to ask\nYou said like two questions so\nIf you could give advice to yourself\nLike, a younger youth\nOn how to do this shit, oh\nIf you had a whole another chance, if you can re-live it\nHow would you have done it? Like what, what, what steps do, do, do\nNot say regret anything but do you think you have done things differently or this was the path that you, you wouldn't have it any other way"
