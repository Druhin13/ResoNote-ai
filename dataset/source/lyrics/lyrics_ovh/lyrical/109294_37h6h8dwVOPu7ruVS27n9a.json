(x2)\n\n\n\nYou run with the devil (x2)\n\n\n\nOoh ooh ooh...\n\n\n\nTell your brother to be good\n\nTell your sister not to go\n\nTell your mother not to wait\n\nTell your father I was good\n\n\n\nAs you lay to die beside me, baby\n\nI'm the one in the shootin' game\n\nWould you wait for me,\n\nThe other one,\n\nWould you wait for me?\n\n\n\nOoh ooh ooh..."
