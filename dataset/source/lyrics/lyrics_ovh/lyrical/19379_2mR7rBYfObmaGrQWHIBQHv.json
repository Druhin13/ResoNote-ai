  "lyrics": "(“To make a long story longer”)\r\nYo, there’s a time and place for everything, so let me start the narrative\r\nI think that I’m the best but I ain’t here comparing arrogance\r\nApparently you’re scared and only acting insecurely\r\nSome overcome their fear—the ones that don’t the ones that worry me\n\nI’ll only make it if I do for self\n\nIt’s a shame what another man’ll do for his wealth\n\nThe whoopin’ from a belt probably did me good\n\nMade me look at the rich like I’m Robin Hood\n\nI started rapping like Rage and got Robin good\n\nFrom the Westside mobbin’ out to Hollywood\n\nOnce the streetlights are on, I guess I probably should\n\nMake my way back home, way before Platform\n\nI was coming up quick without a pop in the mix\n\nAnd I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout sound—my pops and I had a split\n\nSelf-taught to be a man, I learned how to behave\n\nCut my teeth at Venice Beach and had a few close shaves\n\nBeen a lot of places when I stare at the map\n\nBut never been to therapy—for me, that’s rap\n\nI ain’t tryna save the world, won’t continue to spend\n\nJust the people standing on it gonna pay for our sins\n\nBeing concerned with them ends is why I write in the cold\n\nAnd I’ve been righting all my wrongs while I write in the cold\n\nGot the fuck outta dodge and saw the world unfold\n\nOrigami in my palm and leave my girls untold, for real\n\nTo make a long story longer\n\n\n\n(“To make a long story longer”)\n\n\n\nIt was 10 years ago when I took my momma’s laptop\n\nBootlegged a copy of Fruity Loops to get famous\n\nSpent five years making bullshit\n\nRippin’ innocence like a culprit\n\nDippin’ in my memory series playing [?]\n\nRap game rum ham\n\nIf you say he different, then I’ll slap you with my cum hand\n\nRookie to be master, laps of raps over a ghetto blaster\n\nDapper when I’m mackin’, fatter when I’m trackin’\n\nAnd she said, “Like you, I’m only good as my back ends”\n\nI’m no slouch, whether or not it’s rain fallin’ or no clouds\n\nIf only just to make your boy so proud\n\nI’ma tell you when to go now—ghost ride it\n\nMy third eye ghostwrite it\n\nI don’t fight it, ‘cause that’s where my flow is so tightest\n\nBut I’ve been tight since hair was like Bo Bice\n\nI was in the cut like scissors with no dykes\n\nWinnin’ like chicken dinners and grinnin’ like I’ve been sinnin’\n\nRockin’ that tit glitter\n\nAnd if you’re mad at what we’re doing, then you’ve been bitter\n\nBody forbid my heart is a martyr—longevity, my alma mater\n\nAn honor to create until I’m a goner\n\nTo make a long story longer\n\n\n\n(“To make a long story longer”)"
