  "lyrics": "Way up, way up, way up to the sky!\r\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.\r\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\r\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\r\nEnough. Enough. There's no celebrities here\n\nSo why's the bouncer taking everything so seriously?\n\nIt's you, and I\n\nIt's cool you feel the same\n\nLike why's the DJ here if he's just pressing play?\n\n\n\nKickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement\n\nHatin' all the same things too\n\nIf I need a pick-me-up, would you come and pick me up?\n\nI could really use a bud like you\n\nTo pick me\n\n\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the sky!\n\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\n\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the sky!\n\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\n\n\nEnough. Enough. There's no one here that we know\n\nI think I knew a girl who knew the host but she's headin' home\n\nWe're standing, laughing, at the disco ball\n\nLike who'd invest in that, when no one's lookin' at it?\n\n\n\nKickin' in the basement, kickin' in the basement\n\nHatin' all the same things too\n\nIf I need a pick-me-up, would you come and pick me up?\n\nI could really use a bud like you\n\nTo pick me\n\n\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the sky!\n\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\n\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the sky!\n\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high.\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\n\n\nTo pick me way up, way up, way up to the sky!\n\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\n\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the sky!\n\nWhen everybody here is sneaking in and getting high\n\nWay up, way up, way up to the moon!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!\n\nBoy it's good to know I got a bud like you!"
