  "lyrics": "Just like an old friend kinder than expected\r\nThat Cadillac came and gave our girl a ride\r\nLoss has no end, it binds to our connection\r\nWe don't speak of it, we don't even try\r\nIf you could help me to share the trouble\n\nBut you got burned and then you, then you can help me\n\nAnd in our time together\n\nHer memory will ever\n\nShine like golden embers in the night\n\n\n\nI miss the old hymns when she used to sing\n\nThe sparrows spread their mortal wings\n\nNow they've all lighted with the silence of strings\n\nLike notes on the pages she breathed life into all things\n\n\n\nIf you could help me to share the trouble\n\nBut you got burned and then you, then you can help me\n\nAnd in our time together\n\nHer memory will ever\n\nShine like golden embers in the night\n\n\n\nJust like an old friend, reach out to me\n\nBathe me in the light of understanding\n\n\n\nTry to help me to share the trouble\n\nBut you got burned and then you, then you can help me\n\nAnd in our time together\n\nHer memory will ever\n\nShine like golden embers in the night"
