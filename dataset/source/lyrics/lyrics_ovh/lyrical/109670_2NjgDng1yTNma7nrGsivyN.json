  "lyrics": "Autumn come and winter gone\r\nThen spring came all over the lawn\r\nI wanna die then be reborn\r\nLike seasons come and go and gone again\r\nCome again, come again\n\nWhat was that you said?\n\nCome again, come again\n\nC-c-come on down\n\nThe world had better come around\n\n\n\nI feel it in my chest\n\nI feel it in my soul\n\nThe music and the whiskey\n\nAnd it's warm and nurturing in a weird way\n\nI feel it in my face right now when I sing\n\nAnd it makes me wanna cry and scream and cry and\n\n\n\nCome again, come again\n\nWhat was that you said?\n\nCome again, come again\n\nC-c-come on down\n\nCould use a little help comin' around\n\n\n\nAutumn come and winter go\n\nThen spring sprayed all over, all we know\n\nThen summer come in raging, brought my blood right to a boil\n\nBut even the heat too turned around and went\n\nBut it was a long one\n\n\n\nCome again, come again\n\nWhat was that you said?\n\nCome again, come again\n\nC-c-come on down\n\nThe world had better come around\n\nCome again, come again\n\nCome again, yeah\n\nCome again"
