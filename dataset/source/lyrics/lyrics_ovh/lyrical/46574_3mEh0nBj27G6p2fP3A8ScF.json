  "title": "Stars Fell On Alabama",
  "lyrics": "We lived our little drama\rWe kissed in a field of white\rAnd stars fell on Alabama\rLast night\rI can't forget the glamour\rYour eyes held a tender light\rWhile (And) stars fell on Alabama (fractured 'Bama)\rLast night\rI never planned in my imagination\rA situation - so heavenly\rA fairy land where no one else could enter\rAnd in the center - just you and me\rMy heart beat (just) like a hammer\r(My) Arms wound around you tight\rAnd (While) stars fell on Alabama\rLast night"
