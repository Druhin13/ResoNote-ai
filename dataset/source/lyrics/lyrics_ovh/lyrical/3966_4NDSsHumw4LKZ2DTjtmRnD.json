  "lyrics": "I could be contended\r\nI don't need to suffer\r\nYou're beautiful\r\nGood to talk to\r\nYou make an impression\r\nTo take my attention\n\nAnd when you touch my skin\n\nI smell disaster\n\n\n\nStep away - walk away\n\nAll I want is the real thing\n\n(nothing but the real thing)\n\n\n\nWalking on pavements\n\nWe collect in bars\n\nAsleep in the houses\n\nSo alone -\n\nLooking inside herself\n\nShe breaks the glass\n\nTurns her head backwards\n\nShe's fallen down again"
