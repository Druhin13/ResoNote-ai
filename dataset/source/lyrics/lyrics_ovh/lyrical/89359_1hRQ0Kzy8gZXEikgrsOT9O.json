  "lyrics": "I lost my touch and I thought it was you\r\nI lost my way cutting corners, faulty truth\r\nSo I went on my way to recapture what you took\r\nAnd I came back with tape\r\nDare I leave it? Dare I look?\n\nNo way I can go wrong\n\nIt's all there\n\nI know the end\n\nThere's no way out so so long\n\nOh man, not again\n\n\n\nDo I retain yet a feeling over you?\n\nAnd should I explain to the teacher? To my muse?\n\nSo I can get a break from the preacher, from a few\n\nSo I'll go on and take what I need here, wouldn't you?\n\n\n\nNo way I can go wrong\n\nIt's all there\n\nI know the end\n\nThere's no way out so so long\n\nOh man, not again"
