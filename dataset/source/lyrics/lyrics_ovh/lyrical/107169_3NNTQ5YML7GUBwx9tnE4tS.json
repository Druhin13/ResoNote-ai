  "lyrics": "She's one of a kind,\r\nSometimes hard to find\r\nLike a rainbow.\r\nWell, she's lost all her glory,\r\nAnd could tell you some stories that we all need to know.\n\nAnd there's too many hands bein' laid on her.\n\nToo many eyes will never see\n\nThat it's dragging her down,\n\nBut you won't hear a sound as she turns 'round.\n\n\n\nA beauty on a flight\n\nThat always seems to turn the tide at midnight.\n\nAnd for her there is no rest,\n\nWe are doing what is best \n\nFor our futures.\n\n\n\nOne of these days, she may not be so good to you.\n\nOne of these days, she night shake you to the ground.\n\nBut her fire is still burning,\n\nAnd her heart is still yearning to be found.\n\n\n\n(Guitar Solo)\n\n\n\nToo many hands bein' laid on her\n\nToo many eyes will never see,\n\nThat it's dragging her down,\n\nStill you won't hear a sound 'till she turns 'round.\n\n\n\nToo many hands\n\nToo many hands"
