N-O\n\nSnorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo\n\nLet's start a riot, fuck if you tired, yell out\n\n\n\nI don't care if you don't care, we don't\n\nI don't care if you don't care, we don't\n\nLife ain't fair, we ain't scared, we know\n\nI don't care if you don't care, we don’t\n\n\n\nAnd for us to survive we need to uprise our people\n\nMust sanitize the thought of demise, of freedom\n\nLike Allstate, you're in good hands with me though\n\nTaking our children they got us searchin' like for Nemo\n\nI won't take no shit from the government\n\nThey been had plans for this, wasn't suddenly\n\nAnd any time I can, I take the system's hand and crumble it\n\nWhenever you can make a difference, yell it out, don't mumble it\n\nI distract myself from the world, to stay in my element\n\nThe heart I carry takes on the weight of good people's negligence\n\nSo if the government don't give a shit you can't stay mad again\n\nCause we already feel the same way about how they handle shit\n\n\n\nI met the devil my soul I'm not selling but hello (Hello)\n\nRun armageddon, your soul are you selling? N-O (N-O)\n\nSnorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo (Elmo)\n\nLet’s start a riot, fuck if you tired, yell out (yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)\n\n\n\nI don't care if you don't care, we don't (Uh)\n\nI don't care if you don’t care, we don't (Uh)\n\nLife ain't fair, we ain’t scared, we know\n\nI don't care if you don’t care, we don't\n\n\n\nYes, this is a new peacoat, and I paid my taxes\n\nLike Carmelo with the free throw, on they ass like grass\n\nI may seem flyer than a seagull, Harry Potter glasses\n\nCleaning Stanley Steamer steam hoe, call me Ski no slow slope\n\nHumanity sucks, humanity blows, no cello\n\nNo hablo Español, but dinero\n\nDrop my top, JFK, leggo\n\nThey wanna link, they try to build, Legos\n\nHold on to something, I am eruptin'\n\nIt’s a destruction, sons of the anarchy\n\nBust up teeth for my lunch bitch, with no discussion\n\nThis is disgusting', fake it to make it you-\n\n\n\nI met the devil my soul I’m not selling but hello\n\nRun armageddon, your soul are you selling? N-O\n\nSnorlax, I'm lazy, come tickle me baby, Elmo\n\nLet’s start a riot, fuck if you tired, yell out (Fuck if you tired, yellow out)\n\n\n\nI don’t care if you don’t care, we don’t\n\nI don’t care if you don’t care, we don’t\n\nLife ain’t fair, we ain’t scared, we know\n\nI don’t care if you don’t care, we don’t"
