  "lyrics": "I can see your neon eyes cuttin' through the barroom smoke\r\nStopped me in my tracks like a stick in the spokes\r\nI see you workin' that smile from across the room\r\nMy heart's burnin' just to learn about you\r\nLike a bowl of moonshine on a Saturday night\n\nYou light me up, you're blowin' my mind\n\nLike the fireworks stand on the Fourth of July\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\n\n\nI need somethin' cold as ice just to cool me down\n\nAnd a hook on a line that I can throw out\n\nI'm gonna make my move but I don't know what to say\n\nAnother look from you, and I'm blown away\n\n\n\nLike the red sun up against the clear blue sky\n\nYou light me up, you're blowin' my mind\n\nLike the fireworks stand on the Fourth of July\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\n\n\nShould I ask you to dance? Yeah I outta\n\nOh I can't believe somebody brought ya\n\nGirl, I knew it from the moment I saw ya\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\n\n\nLike a bowl of moonshine on a Saturday night\n\nYou light me up, you're blowin' my mind\n\nLike the fireworks stand on the Fourth of July\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\n\n\nLike the red sun up against the clear blue sky\n\nYou light me up, you're blowin' my mind\n\nLike the fireworks stand on the Fourth of July\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter\n\nThere ain't nobody hotter"
