  "lyrics": "Never enough\r\nYou'll always find those days when it's rough\r\nBut you need to feel existent\r\nKeep it real and be persistent\r\nNo one can win\n\nIf you wake up tryna get out of your skin\n\nYou're the one you have to live with\n\nSlow it down, don't overthink it\n\n\n\nThere are people that won't accept a \"no\" from you\n\nThere are those who won't see you as a person just success\n\nDon't give in, if you feel that it's not right for you\n\nDon't you do it, oh\n\n\n\nIt's tough to play the part in somebody's show\n\nA \"no\" is always \"no\", don't try to convince me\n\nIt's hard to face the world when words are left unheard\n\nWake me when it's quiet\n\nWake me when it's quiet\n\n\n\nOn a better day, come wake me up\n\nOn a better day, come wake me up\n\nOn a better day, come wake me up\n\nWake me when it's quiet\n\n\n\nPushing the edge (pushing the edge)\n\nJust to give your crowd a smile on their face\n\nThere are levels of emotions\n\nJust don't let it get you over\n\n\n\nThere are people that will accept a \"no\" from you\n\nThere are thousands who'll see you as a person, not success\n\nDon't give in, if you feel that it's not right for you\n\nDon't you do it, no\n\n\n\nIt's tough to play the part in somebody's show\n\nA \"no\" is always \"no\", don't try to convince me\n\nIt's hard to face the world when words are left unheard\n\nWake me when it's quiet\n\nWake me when it's quiet\n\n\n\nOn a better day, come wake me up\n\nOn a better day, come wake me up\n\nOn a better day, come wake me up\n\nWake me when it's quiet\n\n\n\nIt's tough to play the part in somebody's show\n\nA \"no\" is always \"no\", don't try to convince me\n\nIt's hard to face the world when words are left unheard\n\nWake me when it's quiet"
