  "lyrics": "Desperate living- driving me mad\r\nWritings on the wall\r\nCrushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had\r\nJust to watch them fall\r\nTearing it up in the daytime\n\nBurning it down at night\n\nHow long does it take\n\nTo break the spell\n\nStraight to the top\n\nTooth and Nail\n\n\n\nLast generation- reckless and free\n\nUp against the odds\n\nThoughts of revenge are going trough me\n\nFate lies in the cards\n\n\n\nTearing it up in the daytime\n\nBurning it down at night\n\nHow long does it take\n\nTo break the spell\n\nStraight to the top\n\nTooth and Nail\n\n\n\nDesperate living- trying to see\n\nBreaking all the rules\n\nOnly the strongs are gonna be free\n\nFrom a world of fools\n\n\n\nTooth and Nail\n\nTooth and Nail\n\nStraight to the top\n\nTooth and Nail"
