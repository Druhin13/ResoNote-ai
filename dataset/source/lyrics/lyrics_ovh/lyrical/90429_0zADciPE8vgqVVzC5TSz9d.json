  "lyrics": "Eddie waited til he finished high school\r\nHe went to Hollywood, got a tattoo\r\nHe met a girl out there with a tattoo too\r\nThe future was wide open\r\nThey moved into a place they both could afford\n\nHe found a night club he could work at the door\n\nShe had a guitar and she taught him some chords\n\nThe sky was the limit\n\n\n\nInto the great wide open\n\nUnder them skies of blue\n\nOut in the great wide open\n\nA rebel without a clue\n\n\n\nThe papers said Ed always played from the heart\n\nHe got an agent and a roadie named Bart\n\nThey made a record and it went in the chart\n\nThe sky was the limit\n\n\n\nHis leather jacket had chains that would jingle\n\nThey both met movie stars, partied and mingled\n\nTheir A&R man said, \"I don't hear a single.\"\n\nThe future was wide open\n\n\n\nInto the great wide open\n\nUnder them skies of blue\n\nOut in the great wide open\n\nA rebel without a clue"
