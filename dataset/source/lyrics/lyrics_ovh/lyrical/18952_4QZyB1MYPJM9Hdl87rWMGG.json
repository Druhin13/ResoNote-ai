  "lyrics": "Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter\r\n'Cause all my life, I've been fighting\r\nNever felt a feeling of comfort\r\nAll this time, I've been hiding\r\nAnd I never had someone to call my own, oh nah\r\nI'm so used to sharing\n\nLove only left me alone\n\nBut I'm at one with the silence\n\n\n\nI found peace in your violence\n\nCan't show me there's no point in tryin'\n\nI'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long\n\nI found peace in your violence\n\nCan't show me there's no point in tryin'\n\nI'm at one, and I've been silent for so long\n\n\n\nI've been quiet for so long\n\nI've been quiet for so long\n\nI found peace in your violence\n\nCan't tell me there's no point in tryin'\n\nI'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long\n\n\n\nI'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors\n\nMy whole life, I've felt like a burden\n\nI think too much, and I hate it\n\nI'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring\n\nLoving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence\n\n\n\nI found peace in your violence\n\nCan't show me there's no point in tryin'\n\nI'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long\n\nI found peace in your violence\n\nCan't show me there's no point in tryin'\n\nI'm at one, and I've been silent for so long\n\n\n\nI've been quiet for so long\n\nI've been quiet for so long\n\nI found peace in your violence\n\nCan't show me there's no point in tryin'\n\nI'm at one, and I've been quiet for so long"
