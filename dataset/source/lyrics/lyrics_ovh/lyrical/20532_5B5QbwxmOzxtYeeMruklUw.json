  "lyrics": "Maybe you need some time on your own\r\n'Til you figure this out\r\nWell what if you sit inside by yourself and tape the windows shut?\r\nYou could black out the sun and watch the moon eclipse for a while\r\nHey, hey, it's alright\n\nI know you think you haven't got time but you've got your whole life\n\nSometimes I think I need to watch the world go by\n\n'Cause I don't wanna always have to try\n\n\n\nMaybe today when I go out, it will feel different\n\nAnd I won't be scared at all\n\nWhen a stranger sits too close to me, I won't panic\n\nI won't feel my skin crawl\n\nWell I won't hate my body, yeah I won't get a ticket\n\nI'll find what I'm looking for, I'll fill a hole\n\nYeah I will smell the roses, I won't see any posers\n\nAnd all my debt will turn to simply nothing at all\n\n\n\nHey, hey, it's alright\n\nI know you think you haven't got time but you've got your whole life\n\nSometimes I think I need to watch the world go by\n\n'Cause I don't wanna always have to try\n\nHey, hey, it's alright\n\nI know you think you haven't got time but you've got your whole life\n\nSometimes I think I need to watch the world go by\n\n'Cause I don't wanna always have to try\n\n\n\nYeah, I don't wanna always have to try\n\nYeah, I don't wanna always have to try"
