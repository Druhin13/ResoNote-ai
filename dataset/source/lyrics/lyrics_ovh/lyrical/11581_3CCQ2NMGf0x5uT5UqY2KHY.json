  "lyrics": "Today I'll write about my cat\r\nSitting in my kitchen\r\nWould you like that?\r\nI know sometimes I'm a bore and moody at best\r\nI can be a drag\r\nGothBoiClique\n\nI know I'm confused a lot\n\nTwo people, one command\n\nDo what thou wilt with me\n\nI know not what I am\n\nMost often I'm normal and hold you next to me\n\nBut some nights I'm under the spell of darker beings\n\nMagic practitioner\n\nSymbols I know as true\n\nTurn my computer off\n\nI jump on top of you\n\n\n\nReveal my inner self, the path is always back to you\n\nSo what's up\n\nDo we have\n\nEnough time\n\nBetween us\n\nBecause...\n\n\n\nI saw you in a dark room covering your head\n\nSo you might be unaware that I came in through the back\n\nI thought you knew me from the start and I that I was into bad things\n\nI guess that I was wrong though, I'm sorry about that...\n\n(Magic practitioner, I jump on top of you)\n\nI tore through the fabric of love in four dimensions\n\nIn song I say your name in casting your ascension\n\nStep through to other worlds unknowing where it leads me to\n\nReveal my inner self, the path is always back to you\n\nIn secrets that tie us apart from everything...\n\nHigh strangeness"
