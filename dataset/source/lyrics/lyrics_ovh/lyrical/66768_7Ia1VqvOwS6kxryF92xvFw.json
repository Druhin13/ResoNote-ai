  "lyrics": "Go down to wait all night\nShe's bound to run him out\nThe rest of the nothing of anyhow\nTo each his own\n\nThe garden is sorting out\n\nShe curls her lips on a bar\n\nI don't know if you're dead or not\n\nIf you're anyone\n\n\n\nCome on and get the minimum\n\nBefore you open up your eyes\n\nIt's all being served in your hands\n\nYour addled eyes\n\n\n\nCome on and get to open yours\n\nCollected at the borderlines\n\nThey want to get up in your hair\n\n\n\nCos they know, so do I\n\nThe high road is hard to find\n\nA detour in your new life\n\nTell all of your friends getting warm\n\n\n\nThe dogs who ran all night\n\nThe son who hoped it would\n\nBreak from the warfare in your house\n\nTo each his own\n\n\n\nThe soldier is bailing out\n\nAnd curled his lips on a bar\n\nAnd I don't know if the dead can talk\n\nTo anyone \n\n\n\nCome on and get the minimum\n\nBefore you open up your eyes\n\nIt's all being served in your hands\n\nAre you one of us\n\n\n\nCome on and get to open yours\n\nCollected at the borderlines\n\nThey want to get up in your hair\n\n\n\nCos they know, so do I\n\nThe high road is hard to find\n\nA detour in your new life\n\nTell all of your friends getting warm\n\n\n\nIt's too late to change your mind\n\nYou let laws be your guide \n\n\n\nIt's too late to change your mind\n\nYou let laws be your guide\n\n\n\nIt's too late to change your mind\n\nYou let laws be your guide"
