  "lyrics": "Lonely days in Californ-i-a\r\nWhere everyday is one big masquerade\r\nIn the hills I found a sign that spells your name\r\nAll these X and O's can't take away the pain\r\nSo go light that cigarette\n\nI hope your lungs can take the heartache\n\nOur feet in wet cement\n\nCan we finish what's been started?\n\n\n\nYou only call me when the sun sets\n\nI only touch you when the tide's high\n\nNo talking when we undress\n\nBut your body got my eyes wide\n\nBump heads while the bed's bumpin'\n\nLeft hand grips your right thigh\n\nNo love, we just love sex\n\nBut we hate it when the night dies\n\n\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\n\n\nSafe to say I'm surfing through your brain, in Hanalei\n\nMaking waves on a wave\n\nFace to face, working through the pain\n\nWe never change, but I love watching you change\n\nI came back to get closer\n\nLost you when you lost sober\n\nRuby rings and mimosas\n\nI'm heartless in Hermossa\n\nSorry that I've been colder, but...\n\n\n\nYou only call me when the sun sets\n\nI only touch you when the tide's high\n\nNo talking when we undress\n\nBut your body got my eyes wide\n\nBump heads while the bed's bumpin'\n\nLeft hand grips your right thigh\n\nNo love, we just love sex\n\nBut we hate it when the night dies\n\n\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\n\n\nSo go light that cigarette\n\nI hope your lungs can take the heartache\n\nOur feet in wet cement\n\nCan we finish what's been started?\n\n\n\nYou only call me when the sun sets\n\nI only touch you when the tide's high\n\nNo talking when we undress\n\nBut your body got my eyes wide\n\nBump heads while the bed's bumpin'\n\nLeft hand grips your right thigh\n\nNo love, we just love sex\n\nBut we hate it when the night dies\n\n\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous\n\nWe don't cry for love\n\n'Cause that's dangerous"
