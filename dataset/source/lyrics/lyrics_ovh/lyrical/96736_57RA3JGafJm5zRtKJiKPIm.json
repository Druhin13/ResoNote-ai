  "lyrics": "What's wrong?\r\nYou've been asking but I don't have an answer\r\nHow come?\r\nI'm still thinking, let's pretend to fall asleep now\r\nWhen we get old, will we regret this?\r\nToo young to think about all that shit\n\nAnd stalling only goes so far when you've got a head start\n\n\n\n'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset\n\nBut I can't help from asking, \"Are you bored yet?\"\n\nAnd if you're feeling lonely you should tell me\n\nBefore this ends up as another memory\n\nWill you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?\n\nWill you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?\n\n\n\nFeels like I've known you my whole life\n\nI can see right through your lies\n\nI don't know where we're going\n\nBut I'd like to be by your side\n\nIf you could tell me how you're feeling\n\nMaybe we'd get through this undefeated\n\nHolding on for so long\n\n\n\n'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset\n\nBut I can't help from asking, \"Are you bored yet?\"\n\nAnd if you're feeling lonely you should tell me\n\nBefore this ends up as another memory\n\nWill you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?\n\nWill you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?"
