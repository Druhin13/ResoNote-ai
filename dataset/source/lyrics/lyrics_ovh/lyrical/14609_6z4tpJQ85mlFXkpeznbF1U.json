  "lyrics": "We are only hotter in a lot of coal\r\nI am really telling you, we're meant to be\r\nYou might shape the world in ways impossible\r\nBut do you think that you could find a way to stay with me?\r\nGetting high in denial\n\nLove the wings we stole\n\nSleeping in and listening to Russian soul\n\nAnd it feels like it seems that when I'm with you\n\nWe become each other\n\n\n\nI don't mind if you'll find this a part of me\n\nI would never want someone else to see\n\nIt's insane, but it's true\n\nWhen it's only me and you\n\nWe become each other\n\n\n\nWe'll be like the others once we give it a thought\n\nFearless, reckless, don't consider anything\n\nWe were only following the shouts of our hearts\n\nAnd when we fought it, we had brought the logic in\n\n\n\nGetting high in denial\n\nLove the wings we stole\n\nSleeping in and listening to Russian soul\n\nAnd it feels like it seems that when I'm with you\n\nWe become each other\n\n\n\nI don't mind if you'll find this a part of me\n\nI would never want someone else to see\n\nIt's insane, but it's true\n\nWhen it's only me and you\n\nWe become each other\n\n\n\n[?]\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting high in denial\n\nLove the wings we stole\n\nSleeping in and listening to Russian soul\n\nAnd it feels like it seems that when I'm with you\n\nWe become each other\n\n\n\nI don't mind if you'll find this a part of me\n\nI would never want someone else to see\n\nIt's insane, but it's true\n\nWhen it's only me and you\n\nWe become each other"
