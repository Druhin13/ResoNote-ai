  "lyrics": "Love is a beautiful thing\r\nHugging, Kissing, Laughing, holding hands\r\nLove is a beautiful thing\r\nUnless it's you loving another man\r\nAnd I can't stand to see you hugging, kissing, laughing, holding hands\r\nIf it's not me you see how could that be a thing of beauty?\n\nOh no\n\n\n\nLove is a beautiful thing\n\nBirds are singing songs down from the trees\n\nLove is a beautiful thing\n\nThe breeze is blowing, rustling Autumn leaves\n\nBut if those leaves are rustling underneath somebody else's feet\n\nIf it's not me you see then how could that be a thing of beauty?\n\n\n\nI find comfort in the leaving\n\nOver time I'll come to see someday how love could be that way\n\n\n\nLove is a beautiful thing\n\nWinter's rage has often leaned to spring\n\nLove is a beautiful\n\nAnd on your hand I see that there's a ring\n\nAnd I would understand if I had put that ring upon your hand\n\nBut it was not me, it seems\n\nHow could that be a thing of beauty?\n\nOh no\n\n\n\nHow could that be a thing of beauty?"
