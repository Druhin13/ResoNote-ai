  "lyrics": "Under my skin, under my bones, under my body\r\nIn the darkness, in the darkness\r\nThe taste of your lips\r\nAll down your kiss and in our bodies\r\nIn the darkness, in the darkness\n\nAnd I can't help myself\n\nAnd I don't want to\n\nAnd you can't help yourself\n\nAnd you don't have to\n\n\n\nWe're just young and reckless\n\nIf we wreck this, it's fine\n\nWe're just young and reckless\n\nIf we wreck this, it's fine\n\n\n\nBack of the car, sat on your lap under the jacket\n\nIn the corner, in the corner\n\nHands on my neck, don't care who sees\n\nFeet out the window\n\nWe're flyin', we're flyin'\n\n\n\nAnd I can't help myself\n\nAnd I don't want to\n\nAnd you can't help yourself\n\nAnd you don't have to\n\n\n\nWe're just young and reckless\n\nIf we wreck this, it's fine\n\nWe're just young and reckless\n\nIf we wreck this, it's fine\n\n\n\nOh, your green eyes\n\nI just wanna watch you\n\nTell me you're mine\n\nAnd I'll do what you want to\n\n\n\nWe're just young and reckless\n\nIf we wreck this, it's fine\n\nIt's fine\n\n\n\nLet's just get undressin'\n\nGet arrested\n\nIt's fine"
