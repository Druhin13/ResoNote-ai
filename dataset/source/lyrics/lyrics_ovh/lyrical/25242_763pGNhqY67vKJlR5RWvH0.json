  "lyrics": "Dusty rays and shattered beams\r\nSlippery roads and sunburned dreams\r\nWinter’s loss becomes summer's gleam\r\nCome wobbling out of the ocean\r\nCome trickle back to den and roost\n\nCome claw and tooth\n\nAnd fish and goose\n\nCome fin and tail\n\nAnd paw and tooth\n\nFor life has a passion for living\n\n\n\nDistant thoughts become cluttered mind\n\nWhat is a drop in the ocean?\n\nFar and few but long behind\n\nWe’re spun by the heavenly motion\n\n\n\nRing the bell sound made crystalline\n\nRing out for the cause of all notions\n\nApril’s dew becomes Autumn’s wine\n\nLeave everything always unbroken"
