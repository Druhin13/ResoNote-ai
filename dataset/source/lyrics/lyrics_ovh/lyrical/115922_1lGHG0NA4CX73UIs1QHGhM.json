  "lyrics": "I always seem to get my way way too late\r\nSay you wanna be a new man with your new lover\r\nJust remember who showed you that\r\nUsed to be about yourself, now you're selfless\r\nGlad I could do that, but\n\nI don't fuck with you like that anymore\n\nBut I still think about that time in New Orleans, oh na\n\nIt's kinda messed up she don't have to see\n\nHow you messed up when you were with me?\n\n\n\nIt's a shame she gon' know everything I taught ya\n\nIt's a shame she gon' get to see your better you\n\nIt's a shame that I went through all that shit\n\nIt's a shame she don't even see the come up\n\nIt's a shame, ah yeah\n\n\n\nYeah, I gave you time 'cause I was blind and I was patient\n\nTried to focus on the good times but the bad out-weighed it\n\nI'm way too good, baby don't stress\n\nHad to let you go so you can be a blessing\n\nOr another girl's lesson\n\n\n\nI don't fuck with you like that anymore\n\nBut I still think about that time in New Orleans, oh na\n\nIt's kinda messed up she don't have to see\n\nHow you messed up when you were with me?\n\n\n\nIt's a shame she gon' know everything I taught ya\n\nIt's a shame she gon' get to see your better you\n\nIt's a shame that I went through all that shit\n\nIt's a shame she don't even see the come up\n\nIt's a shame, ah yeah\n\n\n\nOu, it's a shame\n\nOu, it's a shame\n\nOu, it's a shame\n\nOu, it's a shame, ah yeah\n\n\n\nLook, you foul but never been cold as this\n\nI pull your cards so much, I got an abundance of poker chips\n\nI can't front, I though about you\n\nThen I wrote a song about you\n\nTwo verses, recorded a bridge\n\nAnd then got over it\n\nSo I ain't tripping, just look how cool my composure is\n\nAin't finna text you with all that \"I need some closure\" shit\n\nI can't tell if I'm still salty but don't post a pic with my ex pose\n\nOr I'ma have to expose the bitch, nah\n\nI've been out of it, gotta tear me some vitamins\n\nFor all that jazz, you be sounding like Mitchell Donovan\n\nYou be talking all kinda shit\n\nStill can't see that the problem is\n\n'For I got up inside, girl you didn't know what a condom is\n\nIf the fire burn out, don't trip, just let it\n\nBut I live that kinda life to make a bitch regret it\n\nI ain't gonna complain or vent to sound all sympathetic\n\nBut whenever you ride his dick, make sure you give me credit\n\n\n\nIt's a shame she gon' know everything I taught ya\n\nIt's a shame she gon' get to see your better you"
