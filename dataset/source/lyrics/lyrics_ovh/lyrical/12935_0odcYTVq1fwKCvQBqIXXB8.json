  "lyrics": "I'm sinking like a stone\r\nThrown deep into the sea\r\nTreading water and drowning\r\nIs the same for me\r\nYou gotta hold onto something\n\nBefore you let go of everything\n\nYou gotta love what you have\n\nBefore you miss what you had\n\n\n\nYou gotta learn to walk on water\n\nBefore you run out of air\n\n\n\nI've been washed ashore\n\nReleased from the sea\n\nI've weathered the storm\n\nBreathing life back into me\n\n\n\nAll my life I've been swimming in shallows\n\nAll my life I've been living in shadows\n\nAll my life I've been sinking like stones\n\nAll my life I've been drowning alone"
