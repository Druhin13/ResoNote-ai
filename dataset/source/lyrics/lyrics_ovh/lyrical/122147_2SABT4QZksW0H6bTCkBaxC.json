(Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, bitch\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\n\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, nigga\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, bitch\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\n\n\nEastside Johnny on one, ain't no question what it is\n\n2-2-3, I'll let you hold one if you come between my hands\n\nI'ma slide into the streets, I'ma slide pen\n\nPoliticking on the yard, drop your ass off a tip\n\nI don't trust nobody, but my daughter and my shotty\n\nIf it blasts - that's a bag, if he leave (?) body\n\n2-door seats, you know me\n\nWindows tinted, so the Lord don't see\n\nI like top when she all on me\n\nPennies drop when they call on me\n\nSkin-tight favorite, the red Cortez\n\nClip playin' in, but it's one in the head\n\nGirl don't play with it, heard what I said?\n\nGirl don't play with it, heard what I said?\n\nAin't no stains upon my suede\n\nI been high for like 4 days\n\nOn the vibe for like 4 days\n\nCatchin' fades and runnin' plays\n\nGod damn\n\n\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, nigga\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, bitch\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\n\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, nigga\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, bitch\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\n\n\nI'm on 10\n\nI go in\n\nI just pop\n\nI just win\n\nOff the lot\n\nIn a win\n\nI am Rock\n\nWho is him?\n\nFuck you doin'?\n\nGet a bag\n\nSellin' work\n\nIn a lab\n\nSmokin' purp\n\nIn a Lamb\n\nPull up, skrrrt!\n\nRari, fast\n\nOff the porch, tendencies\n\nTwo for one, ten a piece\n\nFuck them ones, takin\n\nAdd two, twelve deceased\n\nPour one for Stephen Clark\n\nThan jump in and push the start\n\nIf I say this caviar, nigga\n\nI ain't mad at ya\n\nGod damn\n\n\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, nigga\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, bitch\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\n\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nTop off, drop off (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, nigga\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)\n\nYou ain't me, bitch\n\nKnock it off! (Where the cash at?)"
