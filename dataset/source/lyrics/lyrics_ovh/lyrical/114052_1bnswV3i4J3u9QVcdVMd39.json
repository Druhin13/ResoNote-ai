  "lyrics": "I tried it once before but I didn't get too far\r\nI felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart\r\nAnd all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck\r\nBut I waited there forever and nobody even looked up\r\nI tried it once before and I think I mighta messed up\n\nI struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough\n\nBut maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die\n\nBut nothing very special ever happens in my life\n\n\n\nTake the blade away from me\n\nI am a freak, I am afraid that\n\nAll the blood escaping me won't end the pain\n\nAnd I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me\n\nI died to be the white ghost\n\nOf the man that I was meant to be\n\n\n\nI tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut\n\nI thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough\n\nAnd I shoulda told my mother 'mom, I love you', like a good son\n\nBut this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one\n\n\n\nTake the blade away from me\n\nI am a freak, I am afraid that\n\nAll the blood escaping me won't end the pain\n\nAnd I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me\n\nI died to be the white ghost\n\nOf the man that I was meant to be, yeah\n\n\n\nI tried it once again and I think I might black out\n\nI shoulda left a letter but I had nothing to write about\n\nMy blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up\n\nThe cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked\n\n\n\nYeah, take the blade away from me\n\nI am a freak, I am afraid that\n\nAll the blood escaping me won't end the pain\n\nAnd I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me\n\nI died to be the white ghost\n\nOf the man that I was meant to be\n\n\n\nI tried it once again and I think I went too far\n\n(The man that I was meant to be)\n\nI cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart\n\n(The man that I was meant to be)\n\nI couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son\n\nThis life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one"
