  "title": "Memory",
  "lyrics": "Midnight,\r\nNot a sound from the pavement.\r\nHas the moon lost her memory?\r\nShe is smiling alone.\r\nIn the lamplight,\r\nThe withered leaves collect at my feet,\n\nAnd the wind begins to moan.\n\n\n\nMemory,\n\nAll alone in the moonlight.\n\nI can smile at the old days;\n\nI was beautiful then.\n\nI remember the time I knew what happiness was.\n\nLet the memory live again.\n\n\n\nEvery streetlamp seems to beat\n\nA fatalistic warning.\n\nSomeone mutters,\n\nand the streetlamp gutters.\n\nAnd soon it will be morning.\n\n\n\nDaylight,\n\nI must wait for the sunrise.\n\nI must think of a new life,\n\nAnd I mustn't give in.\n\nWhen the dawn comes,\n\nTonight will be a memory, too.\n\nAnd a new day will begin.\n\n\n\nBurnt out ends of smoky days,\n\nThe stale, cold smell of morning.\n\nA streetlamp dies,\n\nAnother night is over.\n\nAnother day is dawning.\n\n\n\nTouch me!\n\nIt's so easy to leave me\n\nAll alone with the memory\n\nof my days in the sun.\n\nIf you touch me,\n\nYou'll understand what happiness is.\n\nLook, a new day has begun."
