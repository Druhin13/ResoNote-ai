  "lyrics": "I know it's ugly turning on the news\r\nThere's people fighting over point of view\r\nSometimes it's like there's nothing left to lose\r\nAnd I don't know what to do\r\nBut I know it's better with you\n\nI was a wreck when you came along\n\nWhen there was nothing left\n\nYou showed me the best\n\nI'm still a mess but you hold on\n\nDon't know just why you do\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\n\n\nFor every laught there is a silent cry\n\nFor every day there is a darker night\n\nSometimes this life doesn't treat us right\n\nAnd I don't know what to do\n\nBut I know it's better with you\n\n\n\nI was a wreck when you came along\n\nWhen there was nothing left\n\nYou showed me the best\n\nI'm still a mess but you hold on\n\nDon't know just why you do\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\n\n\nWherever you are, it's never as dark\n\nWhenever I start slipping, you make all the difference\n\nBeen there from the start, no matter how hard\n\nWhatever piece is missing, you know how to fix it\n\n\n\nI was a wreck when you came along\n\nWhen there was nothing left\n\nYou showed me the best\n\nI'm still a mess but you hold on\n\nDon't know just why you do\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you\n\nBut I know I'm better with you"
