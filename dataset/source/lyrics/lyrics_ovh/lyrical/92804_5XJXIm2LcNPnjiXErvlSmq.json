  "lyrics": "I can see the sky for miles, I can see that time so clear\r\nWhen you told me forever, was a word that I should not fear\r\nI can see you driving and smoking, Virginia Slims on the dash\r\nOn that day I was crying, you stopped the car looked back\r\nYou said\n\nBoy get the message\n\nThis ain't no New York City\n\nBorn and bred in West Texas\n\nRaised you to be different\n\nNo matter how it ends, no matter all your sin\n\nI hope you will understand\n\nWhen I leave, you better be a good man\n\n\n\nI can see that house in the summer, baseball in the year\n\nAnd when my knees got bloody, you told me keep playing hard\n\nI remember mass on Sundays, collared up to the ten\n\nYou were so damn faithful, even if it all was a mess\n\nAnd in those years that we weren't speaking, when I was drinking for some meaning\n\nYou called me on the phone and then you said\n\n\n\nAnd it's so hard to imagine what I'll do without you here\n\nAs you gaze your eyes towards mine tell me to wipe away those tears\n\nYou say Jesus loves you, always will no matter where you've been\n\nAnd in that moment, I'm a kid again\n\nYou said"
