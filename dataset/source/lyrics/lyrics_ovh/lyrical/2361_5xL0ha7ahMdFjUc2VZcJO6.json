  "lyrics": "I've been sinking I've seen all the cities lows\r\nFour day weekends ain't so good when your alone.\r\nI'm tripping off me and you now\r\nI'm rolling on a whole new High.\r\nSounds crazy but you changed me somehow, baby your giving me new blood\n\nYou make me wanna come clean\n\nPut down the booze and the cocaine\n\nShow you my ghost and my heartaches\n\nCause even a fool Can change.\n\nYou make me wanna come clean\n\nShake of the haze and the Numbness\n\nTurn off the voices in my head\n\nTill only the good remains\n\n\n\nI've been thinking\n\nMakes me cringe cause I wasted time\n\nYour a Vision\n\nIt's so clear\n\nWith a sober mind\n\n\n\nI'm tripping off me and you now\n\nI'm rolling on a whole new High.\n\nSounds crazy but you changed me somehow, baby your giving me new blood\n\n\n\nYou make me wanna come clean\n\nPut down the booze and the cocaine\n\nShow you my ghost and my heartaches\n\nCause even a fool Can change.\n\nYou make me wanna come clean\n\nShake of the haze and the Numbness\n\nTurn off the voices in my head\n\nTill only the good remains\n\n\n\nSaid I know we've been through hell and back and I dragged you along the way\n\nBut you stayed strong and pulled me back so I need you to hear me say"
