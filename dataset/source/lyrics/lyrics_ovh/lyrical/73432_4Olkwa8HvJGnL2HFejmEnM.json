  "lyrics": "Jim Morrison, Miami County Prison, \nlookin' out the window at the barbed wire fence\nSinging \"This ain't for me, this rock and roll scene.\nI should be writing poetry on a farm out in France.\n\n\"Cause I can't see through the darkness. I can't feel no pain. \n\nSeems you lose your spark when you achieve your fame.\n\nI could start it all over, I could escape. \n\nIf I could only make it to 28\n\nIf I could only make it to 28.\"\n\n\n\nJanis Joplin, one foot in the coffin. \n\nLeft that field a-rockin' and she walked on out the door. \n\nShe put her head in her hands, she said \"I've given all I can. \n\nI drain myself for these fans. I ain't never been this dry before.\n\n\n\n\"But Imma move out of this Chelsea Hotel, stop drinking all the time. \n\nStop blowin' Leonard Cohen and listening to him whine.\n\nCause I know I am beautiful, I will prove it someday. \n\nIf could only make it to 28.\n\nIf I could only make it to 28.\"\n\n\n\nAnd Kurt Cobain sat in his shirt in the rain, \n\nstomach full of pain, eyes growin' dark. \n\nHe said \"I'm losing control. Oughta move down to San Francisco, \n\nlight candles at all of my shows and switch to acoustic guitars.\n\n\n\n\"Cause this world don't need no more tension and hate. \n\nNeeds a reason for these kids to stand up and create.\n\nAnd I could pull this trigger, or I could just walk away, \n\nif I could only make it to 28.\n\nIf I could only make it to 28.\n\nIf I could only make it\n\nIf I could only make it.\""
