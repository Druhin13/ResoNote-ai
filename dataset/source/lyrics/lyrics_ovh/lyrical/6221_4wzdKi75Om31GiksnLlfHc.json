  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lemon Boy par Cavetown\r\nThere once was a bittersweet man and they called him, \"Lemon Boy\"\nHe was growing in my garden and I pulled him out by his hair like a weed\nAnd like weeds do he only came and grew back again\nSo, I figured this time I might as well let him be\n\nLemon Boy and me started to get along together\nI helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather\nIt’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him\nSo I got myself a citrus friend\n\n\nBut soon his bittersweet started to rub off on me\nYou’d think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat\nI found out that my friends are more of the savoury type\nAnd they weren’t too keen on compromising with a nice lemon pie\n\nSo Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along together\nI'll help him plant his seeds and we'll mow the lawn in bad weather\nIt’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him\nSo, I got myself a citrus friend\n\nBut what if I run out of fertilizer\nWhat if the clouds run out of rain\n\nWhat if Lemon Boy won’t grow no longer\nWhat if the beaches dry of sugarcane\nOh well\n\nThe whales start to beach themselves\nThe tortoise shells tear away from their spines\nIt happens all the time, it happens all the time\n\nLemon Boy and I, we’re gonna live forever\nLike Snufkin and Little My, we’ll get around wherever\n\nLemon Boy and I, we’re gonna live forever\nLike Snufkin and Little My, we’ll get around wherever\nIt’s actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him\n\n\n'Cause we're the bitterest boys in town\nYeah, we’re the bitterest guys around\nAnd I got myself a citrus friend"
