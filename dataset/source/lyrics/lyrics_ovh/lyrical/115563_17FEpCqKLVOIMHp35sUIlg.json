  "lyrics": "You were the one to visit my darkness\r\nYou were the brightest way\r\nYou dropped a stone into the well\r\nWe'd wait for the sound it made\r\nWhen it got quiet, you could hear your heart\r\nTell me, what did it say?\n\nI was a bird, you opened the cage\n\nIt felt like a clean white page\n\n\n\nYou came along\n\nYou light up my days, my personal sun\n\nShowing me all the ways I could fall\n\nYou made me feel new\n\nI'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you\n\nBaby, feel me crash\n\nI'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you\n\nBaby, feel me crash\n\n\n\nYou came along\n\nYou light up my days, my personal sun\n\nShowing me all the ways I could fall\n\nYou made me feel new\n\nI'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you\n\nBaby, feel me crash\n\nI'm crashing, I'm crashing right into you\n\nBaby, feel me crash"
