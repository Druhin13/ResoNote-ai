  "lyrics": "Maybe I don't wanna know the reason why\r\nBut lately you don't talk to me\r\nDarling, I can't see me in your eyes\r\nI hold you near but you're so far away\r\nAnd it's losing you I can't believe\r\nTo watch you leave and let this feeling die\n\nYou alone are the living thing that keeps me alive\n\nAnd tomorrow if I'm here without your love, you know I can't survive\n\nOnly my love can raise you high above it all\n\n\n\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\n\nDon't throw it all away, our love\n\nDon't throw it all away, our love, our love\n\nDon't throw it all away, our love\n\n\n\nWe can take the darkness and make if full of light\n\nBut let your love flow back to me\n\nHow can you leave and let this feeling die?\n\nThis happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone\n\nAnd I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on\n\nNo other woman's love could be as true, I'm begging you\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n\nWe changed the world we made it ours to hold\n\nBut dreams are made for those who really try\n\nThis losing you is real, but I still feel you here inside\n\n\n\nCHORUS"
