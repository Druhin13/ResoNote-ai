  "lyrics": "One fine day, this, too, shall fade\r\nYou never know, never know, never know\r\nThis long lament, this bitter end\r\nLet it go, let it go, let it go\r\nKeep moving on, move on\n\nThe road is winding as the day is long\n\nSomewhere beyond, a new dawn\n\nBeckons us to find the place where we belong\n\n\n\nThough it's so hard to wait\n\nFor changes to come\n\nThey're only a heartbeat away\n\n\n\nThe ache inside, the restless nights\n\nSo alone, so alone, so alone\n\nAnd hopes intent to love again\n\nOnly grows, only grows, only grows\n\n\n\nSo here we are, too far\n\nIn the deep again with drowning hearts\n\nWhere do we start, it's so hard\n\nThrough our tragedies, we found out who we are\n\n\n\nThough it's so hard to wait\n\nFor changes to come\n\nThey're only a heartbeat away\n\n\n\nThe long-suffering is never gone\n\nThe tragedies we face, we can't outrun\n\nBut time heals the ache, though all we had is gone\n\nThe promise still remains of what's to come\n\nHm, what's to come\n\n\n\nAnd though it's so hard to wait\n\nFor changes to come\n\nThey're only a heartbeat away\n\n\n\nAnd the hope still remains\n\nThat a radiant love\n\nIs only a heartbeat away\n\n\n\nOne fine day, this, too, shall fade\n\nYou never know, never know, never know\n\nOne fine day, this, too, shall fade\n\nYou never know, never know, never know"
