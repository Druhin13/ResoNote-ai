  "lyrics": "Three thousand miles away I'm feeling something desperate\r\nCame with one life to change so you're the one I left with\r\nI think I found myself in the new light today\r\n(So I) so I let these chemicals and poison lead the way\r\nI feel when you're looking at me\n\nThat you're far from happy\n\nIf only we could wait for the truth\n\nWhen you know it's not so dramatic\n\nLet's cut through the static\n\nAnd be the living, the living proof\n\n\n\nYou're in your head again, this place has got you trembling\n\nI'll be your medicine if you help write the alternate ending\n\nI thought I found myself in the new light today\n\n(So I) but the darkness inside me it pushes you away\n\n\n\nPushes you away\n\n\n\nI feel when you're looking at me\n\nThat you're far from happy\n\nIf only we could wait for the truth\n\nWhen you know it's not so dramatic\n\nLet's cut through the static\n\nAnd be the living, the living proof\n\n\n\nShow is ending into overtime\n\nIt's not yours to fix, no it's all mine\n\nYou decided, I'm indecisive\n\nNow it's all that you want to believe\n\n\n\nI feel when you're looking at me\n\nThat you're far from happy\n\nIf only you could\n\n\n\nAnd I feel when you're looking at me\n\nThat you're far from happy\n\nIf only we could wait for the truth\n\nWhen you know it's not so dramatic\n\nLet's cut through the static\n\nAnd be the living, the living proof\n\n\n\nThink I found myself in the new light today\n\nAnd be the living, the living proof\n\nSo I let these chemicals and poison lead the way\n\nAnd be the living, the living proof"
