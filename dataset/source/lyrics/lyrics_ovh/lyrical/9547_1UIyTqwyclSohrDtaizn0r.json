(we will always be, always be)\n\nBe with Jesus (always be with the Lord)\n\n\n\nMy Lord, remember me (we will always be, always be)\n\nWhen You come into Your kingdom (always be with the Lord)\n\nLord, remember me (we will always be, always be)\n\nWhen You come into Your kingdom (always be with the Lord)"
