  "lyrics": "We tell tales to belong\r\nOr be spared the sorrow\r\nYou're so fair to be behold\r\nWhat will be left when you're gone?\n\nAnd it changed everything you know\n\nHow we were when the wonders who love\n\nSouthern land, scattered clouds from the cold\n\nAnd, oh, oh, oh, spare me the glow"
