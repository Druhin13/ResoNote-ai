  "lyrics": "Nothing can save us, nothing between\r\nInfinite madness and the spiral of humanity\r\nNothing controls us, nothing breeds\r\nThe void awakens in the quickening of atrophy\r\nAnswer no master, never the slave\n\nCarry your dreams down into the grave\n\nEvery heart, like every soul\n\nEqual to break\n\n\n\nIt's alive\n\nCan you feel it taking hold again\n\nIn your mind\n\nAll your demons are rattling chains\n\nWelcome to a world of pain\n\n\n\nNothing kills us, nothing seethes\n\nExtinction riding on the pale horse of destiny\n\nNothing hates us, nothing can see\n\nThrough our eyes it dives into our minds and sows its disease\n\n\n\nAnswer no master, never the slave\n\nCarry your dreams down into the grave\n\nEvery heart, like every soul\n\nEqual to break\n\n\n\nIt's alive\n\nCan you feel it taking hold again\n\nIn your mind\n\nAll your demons are rattling chains\n\nWelcome to a world of pain\n\n\n\n(It's alive, can you feel it)\n\n\n\nIt's alive\n\nCan you feel it taking hold again\n\nIn your mind\n\nAll your demons are rattling chains\n\nIt's alive\n\nCan you feel it\n\nIn your mind\n\nAll your demons are rattling chains\n\nWelcome to a world\n\nWelcome to a world of pain"
