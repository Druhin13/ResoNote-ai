  "lyrics": "I see a vision of netherworld\r\nA vision full of green and blue\r\nWhere the wild roses grow\r\nOn a mountain high\r\nBeneath a purple coloured sky\n\nI see a vision of a never withering earth\n\nCircled by miracles from far away\n\nNo dust in the wind\n\nThe air full of life\n\nThat is taken by the blind\n\n\n\nIt's no secret\n\nThose leaves will liquify\n\nScattered to the four winds\n\nUntil the night passes by\n\n\n\nIt's no mystery\n\nThat the shadows gape open\n\nLike a cut between the nights of a day without daylight\n\nThat will blur in itself\n\n\n\nIt is a prophecy\n\nThat we will drown in the mirrors of a world beyond abyss\n\nThat will drag you and soar deep and away\n\n\n\nI saw my Neverland\n\nWith dripping drops in the crowns"
