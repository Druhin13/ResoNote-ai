  "lyrics": "These undulating undertones\r\nKeep me glued to you\r\nAs you walk me to the Iron Heart Bushwick\r\nThe spot where your sleeve rides up is the horizon\r\nThis push and pull\n\nSo damn rehearsed\n\nThis metric thud, thud, thud\n\nIt goes off time\n\nI'm (I'm), dust (Dust)\n\nShivering lard beneath these shards\n\nAs we trail off from the bar\n\n\n\nIt's time for you to make a move\n\nYou make me sick, it's all for you\n\nNo need to cleanse, no common sense\n\nJust you, my captive audience (Oh, oh)\n\nTime for you to make a move\n\nYou make me sick, it's all for you (Oh, oh)\n\nNo need to cleanse, no common sense\n\nJust you, my captive audience"
