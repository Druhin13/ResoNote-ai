  "title": "Buildings Have Eyes",
  "lyrics": "Pretty pretty are the girls as they go by\rChilly chilly is the air under moonlit sky\rThe windows watch you as you walk along\rAnd the streets lead back to where you started from\rRefrain:\rThe cities watching and you can't get by\rNo matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes\rThis place is lonely but you can't get away\rNo matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes\rSilly Silly are the thoughts that fill your head\rWish I'd never set out, wish I'd stayed in bed\rYou see reflections from across the street\rSo you better start movin' stop draggin' your feet\rRefrain"
