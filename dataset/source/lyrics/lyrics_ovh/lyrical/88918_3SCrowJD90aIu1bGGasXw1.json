  "lyrics": "I lost my heart at twenty\r\nYou tell me that we ain't the same\r\nI'm feeling like I don't wanna face it\r\nBut baby, we both know that I can't take it back\r\nTake it back to the beginning\r\nBack when we were winning\n\nBack to the days when you'd hold me\n\nYou were my best friend\n\nYou were my best friend\n\n\n\nI just want some, some, something to feel\n\nWon't you say something? Tell me it's real\n\nJust come back home, babe, I need you here\n\nSay we're all good, say we're all good\n\n\n\nNow that the sun's set over the hill\n\nWell, the days long gone\n\nBut I know the sun will rise again in the morning\n\nNow that the sun's set over the hill\n\nWell, the days long gone\n\nBut I know the sun will rise again in the morning\n\nRise again in the morning\n\n\n\nAt twenty one life ain't much fun\n\nYou might go crazy\n\nFeel like I'm running in circles\n\nBruised up and I'm looking purple\n\nCan we just cut to commercial?\n\n\n\nThis ain't right, somethings got a give\n\nGotta make it right\n\n'Cause how am I to live without you?\n\nYeah, you know everything's about you\n\n\n\nHoping the stars will align\n\nI know they will in due the time\n\nYou know I gotta make you mine\n\nI know without you I'ma die\n\nHoping the stars will align\n\nI know they will in due the time\n\nYou know without you I'ma die\n\nBaby, with you, I feel alive\n\n\n\nNow that the sun's set over the hill\n\nWell, the days long gone\n\nBut I know the sun will rise again in the morning\n\nNow that the sun's set over the hill\n\nWell, the days long gone\n\nBut I know the sun will rise again in the morning\n\nRise again in the morning"
