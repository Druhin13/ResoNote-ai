  "lyrics": "Look\r\nNinety-nine problems with a hundred dreams\r\nCaught a million dirty only worth about a hundred clean\r\nNight vision all I'm seeing is the color green\r\nLife is just a black and white movie on a colored screen\n\nTwo Verizons, dreaming bout a new horizon\n\nMy wave got 'em scuba diving, the new Poseidon\n\nBury my truth, this lead is a proof, tearing my suit, my only fear is that you're scared to be you\n\nWhen your true colors showing, you show up out of the blue\n\nDressed black as the night, guess you'll be mourning me too\n\nCome through I save a morning or two\n\nPlease pray for me mama, my karma carries a flu\n\nSo what's a snake to a charmer, that spends too much on designer\n\nCan you tell me the truth? can you tell me why my foes in cahoots\n\nLife sentence, every sentence is life\n\nFuck love I can never get the sentiment right\n\nMan, fuck it\n\n\n\nPrimo, it's the chemo you know\n\nFeel like Nino, feel like Nicki in Casino you know\n\nFeel like Paul he couldn't go like drinking Vino you know\n\nOr maybe Remo moving millions down in Rio you know\n\nStreet cathedral\n\n\n\nHalf the shit I'm buying I don't want for real (I don't even want it)\n\nI copped a Ghost so I can haunt the hills (Skrt)\n\nI swear sometimes I feel possessed by it\n\nSex, drugs that's the best diet\n\nA millionaire can still be pour as shit\n\nA broke man can still be more than rich\n\nI know that more exist\n\nI took the purple pill from Morpheus and Lawrence Fish\n\nBurn!, flame retardant, my brain won't entertain the fucking pain department\n\nI remember watching everybody leave, scraping up some weed just to breathe in that same apartment\n\nTrying to kill the pain with some Percocets\n\nPop two more before they even started working yet\n\nCold! Denim jacket was my only cover\n\nSame year they got my father and my older brother\n\nWomen lie and try to say that I'm their only lover\n\nFuck it, only lover\n\nI tell her try it on a different sucker\n\nI get high and start thinking of her\n\n\n\nPrimo, it's the chemo you know\n\nFeel like Nino, feel like Nicki in Casino you know\n\nFeel like Paul he couldn't go like drinking Vino you know\n\nOr maybe Remo moving millions down in Rio you know\n\nStreet cathedral\n\n\n\nBerlin Benz's custom leather need designo\n\nBig green, Lou Ferrigno you lose the signal\n\nThere's no connection, go you so collected\n\nBut now you rose from the ashes of the smoking section\n\n\n\nPrimo, it's the chemo you know\n\nFeel like Nino, feel like Nicki in Casino you know\n\nFeel like Paul he couldn't go like drinking Vino you know\n\nOr maybe Remo moving millions down in Rio you know\n\nStreet cathedral"
