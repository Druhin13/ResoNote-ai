  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Make A Wish par The Garden\r\nLike a drunk wizard in my ear\nWhispering words I'd like to hear\nMake your wish son, make it quick\nChoose yer words wisely so they'll stick\n\nLike a drunk wizard in my ear\nWhispering words I'd like to hear\nMake your wish son, make it quick\nChoose yer words wisely so they'll stick\n\nI don't make wishes, I make things happen\nLet the tide drag me out, find my own way back\nZero expected, myself erected\nPeople might try to pull you down, expect that\nMy partner and I, we don't take shit\nEnough getting thrown around to clog a toilet\n\nYou might think it's funny, assure you it's not\nMake a good wish fish, you better put in enough thought, yeah\n\nLike a drunk wizard in my ear\nWhispering words I'd like to hear\nMake your wish son, make it quick\nChoose yer words wisely so they'll stick\n\nLike a drunk wizard in my ear\nWhispering words I'd like to hear\nMake your wish son, make it quick\nChoose yer words wisely so they'll stick\n\nGo to bed at 10, back awake at 3\nThe kind of mind I've got - gotta ask what it means\nHappens all the time - start reading up\n\nTime of the night black magics stirring up\nMake a wish now, a wish without a price\nMake it so I can get the right sleep tonight\nEyes open up to the sun, now a sigh of bliss\nSweats all gone now, good thing I made a wish\n\nWe crack at it, if we don't it doesn't work\nCan't make a wish unless we're gonna do the work\nDug a deep hole and and I'm glad we fucking did\nGotta make a sacrifice, get this straight this"
