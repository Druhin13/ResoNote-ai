  "lyrics": "As to the drifters of the high rift plains\r\nThey can see the ashes, and the acid rain\r\nIt turns to dust before their very eyes\r\nAnd it chokes to death within the smog it lies\r\nâ€‹Take one look at your skies\n\nAnd in the darkness realize\n\nKill fear, the power of lies\n\nFor we will not be hypnotized\n\n\n\nTurn back the clock within your glass of sand\n\nTo a time of love within this blackened land\n\nA silent child climbs a mound of char\n\nWhere he plants a seed that grows beyond the stars\n\n\n\nTake one look at your skies\n\nAnd in the darkness realize\n\nKill fear, the power of lies\n\nFor we will not be hypnotized\n\n\n\nTake one look at your skies\n\nAnd in the darkness realize\n\nKill fear, the power of lies\n\nFor we will not be hypnotized\n\n\n\nOh"
