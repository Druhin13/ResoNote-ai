  "lyrics": "There's so many voices\r\nJamming up the stations\r\nAnd it's hard to hear the angels\r\nSo I don't feel too forgiven\r\nAnd I get up in the morning\r\nLike a ghost chained to a haunting\n\nAnd I come home in the evening\n\nBecause you're all I ever wanted\n\n\n\nAnd I feel like you keep me hanging on\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna sing right now\n\nWhile my heart still pounds\n\nBecause tonight is almost over\n\nTomorrow's such a long time\n\nAnd if all my words are gone\n\nTo waste away in the unknown\n\nAs long as you know how I loved you\n\nThat would be the proof of life when I am gone\n\n\n\nNow I used to hear a thunder\n\nThere was lightning in my veins\n\nSometimes I can feel it\n\nLike it's coming back again\n\nSome nights it's so heavy\n\nAnd the weight is pressing down\n\nAnd I lie awake in arguments\n\nWith shadows and with doubts\n\n\n\nBut I feel like you keep me hanging on\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna sing right now\n\nWhile my heart still pounds\n\nBecause tonight is almost over\n\nTomorrow's such a long time\n\nAnd if all my words are gone\n\nTo waste away in the unknown\n\nAs long as you know how I loved you\n\nThat would be the proof of life when I am gone\n\n\n\nSo gimme all your troubles\n\nGimme all the spiders in your brains\n\nLet me see the parts with the real deep scars\n\nThough I cannot wash your sins away\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna sing right now\n\nWhile my heart still pounds\n\nBecause tonight is almost over\n\nTomorrow's such a long time\n\nAnd if all my words are gone\n\nTo waste away in the unknown\n\nAs long as you know how I loved you\n\nThat would be the proof of life when I am gone\n\nAs long as you know how I loved you\n\nThat would be the proof of life when I am"
