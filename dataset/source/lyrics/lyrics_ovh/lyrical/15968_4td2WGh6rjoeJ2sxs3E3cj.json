  "lyrics": "There's a hunger in your bed tonight and\r\nYou think you're worthy of a better life but\r\nTry to pretend your something new and then\r\nMaybe it works this time my friend but I know\r\nYou still get that feeling\n\n\n\nLost the hunger in your head tonight\n\nYou miss the roses on her bathroom tiles but\n\n\n\nThey say this life ain't long enough\n\nI've never been wrong four times before cos I knowâ€¦\n\n\n\nOh they sold you\n\nNow they own you\n\nSkin, bones and eyes\n\nWell it all takes time\n\n\n\nThey say this life ain't long enough\n\nMaybe you'll find some peace of mind but I know\n\n\n\nOh they sold you\n\nNow they own you\n\nSkin, bones and eyes\n\nWell it all takes time"
