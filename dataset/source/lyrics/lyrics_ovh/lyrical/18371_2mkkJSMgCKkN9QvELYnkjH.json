  "lyrics": "Suddenly, the ground gives way\r\nThe spirit moves down the hall\r\nFate reveals the dark remains\r\nOf faith in its last resolve\r\nLeft behind those who wait\n\nFor answers that will not come\n\nOut of time, out of place\n\nInto the great\n\nThe great beyond\n\n\n\nIn denial, the seed and son\n\nThe one who will pay the most\n\nWill revile the one he loves\n\nToo bitter to let this go\n\n\n\nFaith in time will decay\n\nThis tragedy will live on\n\nLove inside slips away\n\nInto the great\n\nThe great beyond\n\n\n\nNow all we've seen or thought to be was just a dream\n\nAll we've seen or thought to be is gone\n\nAll we've seen or thought to be was just a dream\n\nThe sky rips open taking all we've ever known away\n\n\n\nAnd the funeral songs welcome the early dawn\n\nOne more ghost slips away into the great beyond\n\nAs the pyre burns on, the pale rider won't be long\n\nTo push open the gates into the great beyond\n\nThe great beyond"
