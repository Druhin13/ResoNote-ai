  "lyrics": "Sitting by a foggy window\r\nStaring at the pouring rain\r\nFalling down like lonely teardrops\r\nMemories of love in vain\r\nThese cloudy days, make you wanna cry\r\nIt breaks your heart when someone leaves and you don't know why\n\n\n\nI can see that you've been hurting, baby I've been lonely too\n\nI've been out here lost and searching, looking for a girl like you\n\nNow I believe the sun is gonna shine\n\nDon't you be afraid to love again, put your hand in mine...\n\n\n\nBaby, I would never make you cry\n\nI would never make you blue\n\nI would never let you down\n\nI would never be untrue\n\n\n\nI know a place where we can go where true love always stays\n\nThere's no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days\n\n\n\nI believe in second chances\n\nI believe in angels, too\n\nI believe in new romances\n\nBaby, I believe in you\n\nThese cloudy days are coming to an end\n\nAnd you don't have to be afraid to fall in love again\n\n\n\nBaby, I would never make you cry\n\nI would never make you blue\n\nI would never turn away\n\nI would never be untrue\n\nI know a place where we can go where true love always stays\n\nThere's no more stormy nights, no more cloudy days"
