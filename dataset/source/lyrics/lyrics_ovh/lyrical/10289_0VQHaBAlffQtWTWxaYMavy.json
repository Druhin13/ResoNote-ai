  "lyrics": "The judge was all hungover\r\nWhen the president took the stand\r\nSo he didn't really notice\r\nWhen things got out of hand\r\nThen the press boys thank the president\n\nAnd he tells them what to say\n\nThere's a photo opportunity\n\nAnd then they're sent away\n\n\n\nTo a place where nothing matters\n\nWhere the wheels of progress turn\n\nWhere reality is fiction\n\nBut the dogs show no concern\n\n\n\nNow the clerks look out the windows\n\nAt those dogs down in the park\n\nEvery window holds a staring face\n\nEvery desk stands piled with work\n\n\n\nNow a dog cannot imagine\n\nWhat it is to drive a car\n\nAnd we in turn are limited\n\nBy what it is we are\n\n\n\nWe are dogs in our own paradise\n\nIn a theme park of our own\n\nDoggy dancers doing doody\n\nDoggy dreaming all day long\n\n\n\nDreaming all day long\n\nHappy all day long\n\nDreaming all day long\n\nIn a paradise of our own\n\n\n\nWe are dogs in our own paradise\n\nIn a theme park of our own\n\nDoggy dancers doing doody\n\nDoggy dreaming all day long"
