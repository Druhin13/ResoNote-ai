  "lyrics": "I want to be in the witness protection programme\r\nI don't like what we've become\r\nWe've become borderline obsessive compulsives\r\nStop the world I want to get off with you baby\r\nStop right now\n\nAnd it seems to me it's the way it's gonna be\n\nNo-one out there wants to see the things I see\n\nIt's a crazy world a million voices go unheard\n\nWhat became of wanting to be free\n\nOh what a world\n\n\n\nWe lost power long ago\n\nWe reap what we have sown\n\nWe have no conscience to speak of\n\nIt's sheer madness\n\nDon't take the moral high ground\n\nHide behind your fake words\n\nIt's just an excuse\n\nFor your weakness\n\n\n\nWhat a lost opportunity, don't be upset with me\n\nWhat about all the secrets here on Earth\n\nWe unbottled the genie living out fantasies\n\nFell for the propaganda badly\n\nOh what a world\n\n\n\nAnd it seems to me it's the way it's gonna be\n\nNo-one out there wants to see the things I see\n\nIt's a crazy world a million voices go unheard\n\nWhat became of wanting to be free\n\n\n\nAnd it seems to me it's the way it's gonna be\n\nNo-one out there wants to see the things I see\n\nIt's a crazy world a million voices go unheard\n\nWhat became of wanting to be free\n\nOh what a world"
