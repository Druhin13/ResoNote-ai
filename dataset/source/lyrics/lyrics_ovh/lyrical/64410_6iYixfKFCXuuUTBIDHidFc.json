  "lyrics": "Lift up your eyes and see the riches of the all-sufficient King seated in glory\r\nSee his scepter that stretches the expanse of unmeasured space\r\nHear Him who holds all things together declare \"all things are mine without exception\"\r\nSee the curiosity of the cosmos as Christ condescends to His most cherished creatures\r\nSee the astonishment of angels as the Almighty advances towards Earth\r\nSee the humility of the pre-existent King born of a virgin birth\n\nThe Infinite becomes infant, the Maker becomes man\n\nThe divine becomes despised and the Christ is crucified\n\nThe Author of all creation cursed upon the tree that He himself spoke into being\n\nAnd the Lord of life was laid in the tomb but the grave could not contain Him and so the Son of Man was raised to life\n\nBut why?\n\nTo draw near, to pierce our greatest fear\n\nTo shed satisfying blood on our behalf\n\nTo give back the life we were meant to have\n\nTo enjoy, to hear, to adore, to taste\n\nAnd to look with peace upon our Savior's face\n\nAnd to embrace Him with an undying faith\n\nTo interpose all His worthiness into us\n\nAnd serve the most unworthy and undeserving\n\nHe is our God and we are mere men made by Him\n\nWe are not like Him but he loves us and moves among us\n\nThe great uncreated and the created no longer separated\n\nHe is Immanuel, God with us"
