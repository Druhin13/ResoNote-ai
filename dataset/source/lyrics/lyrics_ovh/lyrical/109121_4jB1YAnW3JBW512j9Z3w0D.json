  "lyrics": "Sometimes a mystery, sometimes I'm free\r\nDepending on my mood or my attitude\r\nSometimes I wanna roll or stay at home\r\nWalking contradiction, guess I’m factual and fiction\r\nA little crazy, little sexy, little cool\n\nLittle rough around the edges but I keep it smooth\n\nI’m always left of center and that’s right where I belong\n\nI’m the random minor note you hear in major songs\n\n\n\nAnd I like that\n\nI don’t really give a fuck if I was just the only one\n\nWho likes that\n\nI never like to follow, follow all around, the chase is on\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nI like that\n\n\n\nI don’t care what I look like but I feel good\n\nBetter than amazing, and better than I could\n\nTold the whole world, I’m the venom and the antidote\n\nTake a different type of girl to keep the whole world afloat\n\n\n\n'Cause I’m crazy and I’m sexy and I’m cool\n\nLittle rough around the edges but I keep it smooth\n\nI’m always left of center and that’s right where I belong\n\nI’m the random minor note you hear in major songs\n\n\n\nAnd I like that\n\nI don’t really give a fuck if I was just the only one\n\nWho likes that\n\nI never like to follow, follow all around, the chase is on\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nI like that\n\n\n\nI remember when you called me weird\n\nWe was in math class, third row, I was sitting by you\n\nRight before Mr. Ammond’s class\n\n'Cause my mom couldn’t afford new Js\n\nPolos, thrift store, thrift clothes that was all I knew\n\nDo you remember?\n\nUh, I remember when you laughed when I cut my perm off\n\nAnd you rated me a six\n\nI was like, “Damn”\n\nBut even back then with the tears in my eyes\n\nI always knew I was the shit\n\n\n\nI like that\n\nI don’t really give a fuck if I was just the only one\n\nWho likes that\n\nI never like to follow, follow all around, the chase is on\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nOh me, oh me, oh me, oh my\n\nI like that"
