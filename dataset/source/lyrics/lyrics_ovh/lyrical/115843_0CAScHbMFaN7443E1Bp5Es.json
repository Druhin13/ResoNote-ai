  "lyrics": "Sunday nights that you wanna\r\nBlack velvet cake\r\nSweet heart can bargain\r\nHalf price mistakes\r\nShe will go down with her ship\n\nLike a good captain\n\nYou're sitting on the dock\n\nPlaying for an audience of one\n\n\n\nPacing your apartment\n\nLinoleum floors\n\nGet a call from an old friend\n\nShe never like them before\n\n\n\nHe will drive all over three lanes\n\nYou sit tight, shotgun\n\nWhen she rifles\n\nWaving for an audience of one\n\n\n\nYou came out from the country\n\nWearing momma's clothes\n\nYou were born in the city\n\nDaddy's dominos\n\n\n\nYou need a record you can move to\n\nWell we got one\n\nDrop the needle\n\nWe are playing for an audience of one\n\n\n\nDrop the needle\n\nWe are playing for an audience of one\n\n\n\nOne gets all of you twos jealous\n\nThree get even less\n\nFour divides you up then you're left\n\nPleasing all your guests\n\n\n\nReach out you point a finger\n\nAnd touch the globe\n\nSpin around and where it stops\n\nYou've got to pack your bags and go\n\n\n\nLand in the Mohave Desert\n\nSing for the sun\n\n\n\nThree's too many when you're playing for an audience of one\n\nTwo's too busy when you're playing for an audience of one\n\nOne is the only way\n\nPlaying for an audience of one"
