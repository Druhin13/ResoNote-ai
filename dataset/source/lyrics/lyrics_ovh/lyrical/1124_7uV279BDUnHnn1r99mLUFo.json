  "lyrics": "You got me high on second fumes\r\nCold city nights and smoking rooms\r\nI know your story off by heart\r\nYou fabricated every part\r\nYou talk too much then say nothing\r\nI'm just the face that buys the drinks\n\nParis, L.A. and all that shit\n\nYou got it how you wanted it\n\n\n\nBut mmm, then you say, then you say\n\nThat you need me for life\n\nBut mmm, I'm okay, I'm okay this time\n\n\n\n'Cause where were you when I was lonely?\n\nNow you acting like you know me\n\nThere's 100 ways to tell you know\n\nAnother 100 more to let you go, go, go\n\n'Cause where were you when I was lonely?\n\nYou never saw but when you called me\n\nI ain't gonna listen anymore\n\nIf you never want me when I'm lonely\n\nWhere were you when I was lonely?\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\nLone\n\nWhere were you when I was lonely?\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\n\n\nAnd I wish you weren't so beautiful\n\nAnd I wish I was so usable\n\nI know I kinda played myself\n\n'Cause you'd always blame somebody else\n\nAnd you always act misunderstood\n\nLike everyone in Hollywood\n\nYou're just as fake as all your friends\n\nAnd I'm glad I won't see then again, ha, huh\n\n\n\nBut mmm, then you say, then you say\n\nThat you need me for life\n\nBut mmm, I'm okay, I'm okay this time\n\n\n\n'Cause where were you when I was lonely?\n\nNow you acting like you know me\n\nThere's 100 ways to tell you know\n\nAnother 100 more to let you go, go, go\n\n'Cause where were you when I was lonely?\n\nYou never saw but when you called me\n\nI ain't gonna listen anymore\n\nIf you never want me when I'm lonely\n\nWhere were you when I was lonely?\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\nLone\n\nWhere were you when I was lonely?\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\nLonely\n\nLonely"
