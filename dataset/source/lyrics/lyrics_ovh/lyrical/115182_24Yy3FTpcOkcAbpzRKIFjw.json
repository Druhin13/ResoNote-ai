  "lyrics": "Am I dreaming, walking in my sleep?\r\nI just can't drop this feeling\r\nUnderneath my feet\r\nThese London streets are moving, rising up at me\r\nAnd all I see are faceless eyes\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\n\n\nDaily life feels like a constant dream\n\nI keep on tripping out, ay\n\nWhy am I such a freak?\n\nI don't know why that painting's staring back at me\n\nI swear, I think its eyes just moved\n\n\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm scared to drink the water\n\nBaby, I think you drank the water\n\n\n\nA hallucination is a perception\n\nIn the absence of external stimulus\n\nThat has qualities of real perception\n\nHallucinations are vivid, substantial\n\nAnd are perceived to be located in external objective space\n\n\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\n\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating\n\nI'm hallucinating, I'm hallucinating"
