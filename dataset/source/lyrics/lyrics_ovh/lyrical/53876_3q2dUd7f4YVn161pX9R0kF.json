  "lyrics": "She just wants to be \nBeautiful, she goes unnoticed, she knows \nNo limits, she craves attention\r\nShe praises an image\r\nShe prays to be sculpted by the sculptor\n\nOh, she don't see the light that's shining\n\nDeeper than the eyes, can find it\n\nMaybe we have made her blind\n\nSo she tries to cover up her pain \n\nAnd cut her woes away\n\n'Cause cover girls don't cry\n\nAfter their face is made\n\n\n\nBut there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\n\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\n\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\n\nThe world could change its heart\n\nNo scars to your beautiful\n\nWe're stars and we're beautiful\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...\n\n\n\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\n\nThe world could change its heart\n\nNo scars to your beautiful\n\nWe're stars and we're beautiful\n\n\n\nShe has dreams to be \n\nAn envy, so she's \n\nStarving, you know,\n\nCover girls eat nothing, she says \n\n\"Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything\n\nWhat's a little bit of hunger?\n\nI can go a little while longer\", she fades away\n\nShe don't see her perfect\n\nShe don't understand she's worth it\n\nOr that beauty goes deep within the surface\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh\n\nSo to all the girls that's hurting\n\nLet me be your mirror\n\nHelp you see a little bit clearer\n\nThe light that shines within\n\n\n\nThere's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\n\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\n\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\n\nThe world could change its heart\n\nNo scars to your beautiful\n\nWe're stars and we're beautiful\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\n\n\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\n\nThe world could change its heart\n\nNo scars to your beautiful\n\nWe're stars and we're beautiful\n\n\n\nNo better you than the you that you are \n\n(No better you than the you that you are)\n\nNo better life than the life we're living \n\n(No better life than the life we're living)\n\nNo better time for your shine, you're a star \n\n(No better time for your shine, you're a star)\n\nOh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful\n\n\n\nAnd there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\n\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\n\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\n\nThe world could change its heart\n\nNo scars to your beautiful\n\nWe're stars and we're beautiful\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\n\n\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\n\nThe world could change its heart\n\nNo scars to your beautiful\n\nWe're stars and we're beautiful"
