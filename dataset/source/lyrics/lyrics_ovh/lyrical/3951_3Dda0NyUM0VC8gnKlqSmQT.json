  "lyrics": "The first cut - is a criminal thing\r\nThe first cut - goes deeper in\r\nEach impression\r\nMakes a chain reaction\r\nEach impression\r\nWill never be never be never be broken\n\n\n\nI'm a white girl - you can see my skin\n\nLook at this picture - that I 'm living in\n\nAnd old scores \n\nNever settle down\n\nI'll keep on walking\n\nTill I'm burried in the cold ground\n\nCold ground \n\nCold cold ground"
