  "lyrics": "Got a warm breeze blowing, cool creek flowing\r\nFull moon high, got a good thing going\r\nGot some old school tracks tweaking on the speakers\r\nWhat we got between us is burning like a fever\r\nIt’s a damn good night, firefly light, bourbon on ice\r\nJust waiting on you and I to\n\n\n\nSet it off, set if off\n\nA little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit\n\nAnd I’ll be like a bottle rocket flying\n\nEvery move striking like lighting\n\nThat 5 alarm touch in your fingertips\n\nTurns an ordinary night into a night like this\n\nLet’s set it off, set it off\n\nSet it off\n\n\n\nWe were hanging on 8, now we’re tipping on 10\n\nYou turn it up a little then you turn it up again\n\nThe curves on you got my body on cruise\n\nYou’re 90 proof smooth but girl them baby blues really\n\n\n\nSet it off, set if off\n\nA little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit\n\nAnd I’ll be like a bottle rocket flying\n\nEvery move striking like lighting\n\nThat 5 alarm touch in your fingertips\n\nTurns an ordinary night into a night like this\n\nLet’s set it off, set it off\n\nSet it off\n\n\n\nOn your mark, get set, go\n\nGive the stars a little rock show\n\nSet fire to this back road\n\nMake midnight into smoke\n\n\n\nSet it off, set if off\n\nA little kiss is all it takes, all it takes to get me lit\n\nAnd I’ll be like a bottle rocket flying\n\nEvery move striking like lighting\n\nThat 5 alarm touch in your fingertips\n\nTurns an ordinary night into a night like this\n\nLet’s set it off, set it off\n\nSet it off\n\n\n\nSet it off\n\nYeah girl, set it off"
