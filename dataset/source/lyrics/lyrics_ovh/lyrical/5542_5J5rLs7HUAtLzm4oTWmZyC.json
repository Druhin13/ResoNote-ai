  "lyrics": "I like my coffee black\r\nTell me how do you like yours\r\nI saw your sneaker stack\r\nDo you want a second course?\r\nOh you keep on coming back\n\nEach time we open the doors\n\nYeah, you've been on my mind\n\nSo can you tell me have I been on yours?\n\n\n\nJust in case you wanna stop in, I clock in\n\nEveryday at quarter to noon\n\nAnd if you just happen to be round much, after lunch\n\nI can take my break real soon for you\n\n\n\nI'm always early shift on the weekend\n\nIf you want something sweet and\n\nI can feed your appetite\n\nAnd if you want a slice of baked heaven\n\nI'm here till eleven tonight, night\n\n\n\nDo you wanna taste my pie?\n\nCause it's especially sweet\n\nAnd though the oven's high\n\nI always turn up the heat\n\n\n\nI know you're trying to diet\n\nBut your eyeing everything that you see\n\nSo there ain't no use in hiding\n\nYou need someone to confide in\n\nAnd your secret's safe with me\n\n\n\nJust in case you wanna stop in, I clock in\n\nEveryday at quarter to noon\n\nAnd if you just happen to be round much, after lunch\n\nI can take my break real soon for you\n\n\n\nI'm always early shift on the weekend\n\nIf you want something sweet and\n\nI can feed your appetite\n\nAnd if you want a slice of baked heaven\n\nI'm here till eleven tonight, night"
