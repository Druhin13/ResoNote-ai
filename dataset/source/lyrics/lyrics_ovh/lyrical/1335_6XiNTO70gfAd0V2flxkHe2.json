  "lyrics": "You're looking sharp as a diamond\r\nYour teeth are white as a bone\r\nI don't know what you're thinking\r\nI like to watch you listening\r\nYou like to be on your own\n\nI like the way you see me\n\nI like it when you take the lead\n\nI'd like to get you alone\n\n\n\nYou gotta lot of walls\n\nI wanna watch 'em fall\n\n\n\nTook it to my friends and they said, \"Don't do it!\"\n\nMessing with my head, I don't listen to it\n\nAll up in your bed and I'm so into it\n\nFlying past the signs saying, \"Stop, don't do it!\"\n\n\n\nPlease don't waste my time, saying, \"Stop, don't do it\"\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nPlease don't waste my time, saying, \"Stop--\"\n\n\n\nYou're looking sharp as a razor\n\nYour voice cuts me to the core\n\n\n\nI don't know what you're thinking\n\nYou're bright and then your withering\n\nI like you better at home\n\nYou always need to see me\n\nYou never can just let me be\n\nYou hate to be on your own\n\n\n\nYou're thinking 'bout a ring\n\nI'm thinking 'bout a fling\n\n\n\nTook it to my friends and they said, \"Don't do it!\n\nHe's messing with your head,\" should've listened to it\n\nRan into a red and I blew right through it\n\nShould've known better when they said, \"Don't do it!\"\n\n\n\nTook it to my friends and they said, \"Don't do it!\n\nHe's messing with your head,\" should've listened to it\n\nRan into a red and I blew right through it\n\nShould've known better when they said, \"Don't do it!\""
