  "lyrics": "I'll see you at the gates when it gets dark\r\nYou jump the wall, I’ll find a place to park\r\nKill the angels if they're keeping guard\r\nHow do I start when you don't know what to say?\r\nNo, I don’t know what to say\n\nYou said the world's already full enough\n\nOf defeated people and you would not be one\n\nAlways a choice to move yourself along\n\nAnd find better and I hope that's where you are\n\nYeah, I know that's where you are\n\n\n\nA doppelgänger with a telling scar\n\nI saw the universe hidden in your heart\n\nWish I told you this before it got too dark\n\nWhere do you start when you know it has to end?\n\n\n\nHow a flower in the rain\n\nOnly grows more when it's grey\n\nYou just shined on brighter\n\nMaking gold out of the pain\n\n\"I can die, but I can't break,\" you said\n\n\"You can rule, I won't obey\"\n\nAs long as I'm still smiling\n\nWell, I don’t know what to say"
