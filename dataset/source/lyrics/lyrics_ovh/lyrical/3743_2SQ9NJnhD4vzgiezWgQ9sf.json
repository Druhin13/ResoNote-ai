Heck no, sucker, 'til we meet again\n\nSaga of the Villain, brand new chapters, do amass new billions\n\nBarf krill on masses and rose-gold pavilions\n\nRare form of integrity, oughta draw gazillions\n\nAll in they feelin's, hatin' gets you nowhere\n\nGo home, practice one-two checks, oh yeah\n\nWord\n\n\n\nOkay alright yo, you brought a knife to a gunfight\n\nYeah well I would do that and stab the shooter, broad sunlight\n\nTadada, I'm bank of rehab, no secrecy\n\nI'm seekin' treatment for beatin' MCs repeatedly\n\nYou petty locals, made for soft shit like Kenny Chesney vocals\n\nMine are more like Reggie Noble's\n\nYeah, I'm up in this bitch with Fonzarelli\n\nLeave MCs ate, Eazy, no Compton deli\n\nOh boy, we in here like Chris Mullin\n\nI'ma do a heel turn and kick your fuckin' skull in\n\nAnd walk away spittin' poetry like Countee Cullen\n\nI'm the one true king of this one-two thing\n\nThe way I kick bars and darts\n\nYou'd think I mixed Marshall's art with mixed martial arts"
