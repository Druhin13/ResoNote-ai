  "lyrics": "Early sunday morning, coffee by my bed\nsunlight on my pillow, music in my head\nearly morning papers are beneath the door\nI see my name and I read on for more\n\nMore, more, more, more\n\n\n\nAs I sit there reading, garbage truck drives by\n\nGarbage that I'm reading just reel in my eyes\n\nEarly morning papers slipping from my hands\n\nWords and words that I don't understand\n\n\n\nDon't play the critic\n\nTry to forget it\n\nListen to the music\n\nOh, don't play the critic\n\n\n\nAs you sit there writing what goes through your head\n\nSo bitter and so biting wishing I was dead\n\nEarly sunday morning slipping to your bed\n\nWords can't hurt you, no words can't hurt you\n\n\n\nDon't play the critic\n\nTry to forget it\n\nListen to the music\n\nOh, don't play the critic\n\n\n\nDon't play the critic\n\nTry to forget it\n\nListen to the music\n\nOh, don't play the critic"
