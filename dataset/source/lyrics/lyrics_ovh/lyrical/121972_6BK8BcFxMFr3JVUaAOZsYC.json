  "lyrics": "Do you ever lie\r\nAwake at night?\r\nJust between the dark\r\nAnd the morning light\r\nSearching for the things\r\nYou used to know\n\nLooking for the place\n\nWhere the lost things go\n\n\n\nDo you ever dream\n\nOr reminisce?\n\nWondering where to find\n\nWhat you truly miss\n\nWell maybe all those things\n\nThat you love so\n\nAre waiting in the place\n\nWhere the lost things go\n\n\n\nMemories you've shared\n\nGone for good you feared\n\nThey're all around you still\n\nThough they've disappeared\n\nNothing's really left\n\nOr lost without a trace\n\nNothing's gone forever\n\nOnly out of place\n\n\n\nSo maybe now the dish\n\nAnd my best spoon\n\nAre playing hide and seek\n\nJust behind the moon\n\nWaiting there until\n\nIt's time to show\n\nSpring is like that now\n\nFar beneath the snow\n\nHiding in the place\n\nWhere the lost things go\n\n\n\nTime to close your eyes\n\nSo sleep can come around\n\nFor when you dream you'll find\n\nAll that's lost is found\n\nMaybe on the moon\n\nOr maybe somewhere new\n\nMaybe all you're missing lives inside of you\n\n\n\nSo when you need her touch\n\nAnd loving gaze\n\nGone but not forgotten\n\nIs the perfect phrase\n\nSmiling from a star\n\nThat she makes glow\n\nTrust she's always there\n\nWatching as you grow\n\nFind her in the place\n\nWhere the lost things go"
