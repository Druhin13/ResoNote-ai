  "lyrics": "Like we understood\r\nMade with adrenaline\r\nSeeping out through the skin\r\nLike only lovers could\r\nHere's where we begin\r\nTime is the medicine\n\nTo heal these needs that only raise our voices\n\n\n\nHigher, higher\n\nTonight we raise the dead\n\nTonight we bury this in fire, fire\n\nUnder the shape of years\n\nAnd the weight that brought us here\n\n\n\nBut we can separate\n\nTo form these hearts in stone\n\nRewrite this pain we own\n\nCaught here in the wake\n\nNothing but genuine\n\nBuilt on a skeleton\n\nOf fractured parts\n\nThat only raise our voices\n\n\n\nHigher, higher\n\nTonight we raise the dead\n\nTonight we bury this in fire, fire\n\nUnder the shape of years\n\nAnd the weight that brought us here\n\n\n\nBetter believe the sea of changes\n\nAnd put these battered bones to rest\n\nNothing invisible or nameless\n\nLeave no reason to confess (confess)\n\n\n\nHigher, higher\n\nTonight we raise the dead\n\nTonight we bury this in fire, fire\n\nUnder the shape of years\n\nAnd the weight...\n\nHigher, higher (Higher, higher, higher)\n\nTonight we raise the dead\n\nTonight we bury this in fire, fire\n\nUnder the shape of years\n\nAnd the weight that brought us here\n\n\n\nBetter believe the sea of changes\n\nAnd put these battered bones to rest\n\nNothing invisible or nameless\n\nLeave no reason to confess\n\nAnd raise our voices\n\nHigher, higher"
