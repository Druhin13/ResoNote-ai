  "lyrics": "Woke up cold with the window open\r\nMiddle of the night still lying alone\r\nAnd did I drink too much again, can I get out of my head?\r\nIf I stare at my phone long enough will it explode\r\nWe could talk but what's the use, I always say too much too soon\n\nI'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand up\n\nI'll step back, I wanna get out but your heart won't stand\n\n\n\nCan we find our way back and live the past again\n\nCold rain in the summer\n\nCan we find our way back and live the past again\n\nNot dressed for the weather, but you never looked better\n\n\n\nMoving on like it's real to me\n\nPlaying the role even when the scene ends\n\nI can act like nothing hurts, say the lines till something works\n\nIf I stare at the light long enough will I go blind?\n\nWe could talk but what's the use, when I just want a reason to see you"
