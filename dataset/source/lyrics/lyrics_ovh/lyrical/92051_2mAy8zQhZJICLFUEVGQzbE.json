  "lyrics": "I've got tired eyes, a black sky\r\nMaking it's home under my lash line\r\nYou keep on crying, babe I don't mind\r\nI keep on staring at the clock tryna pass time\r\nIn my life, it flies by\n\nFaster than you could say \"I love you, goodbye\"\n\n\n\nIt's almost over, you say with a sigh\n\nWill our lives be better when we make it to the other side...\n\nHope we make it to the other side...\n\n\n\nEighteen, prom queen\n\nWe spend our time thinking bout what we'll be doing\n\nWe walk quiet streets, not afraid of the sounds\n\nNothing bad ever happens in this town\n\n\n\nMean dreams, can't sleep\n\nYounger me thought this'd be more bittersweet\n\nBut we never noticed how long I'd been\n\nGot to caught up in the life we're living...\n\nHope we make it to the other side...\n\n\n\nAnd I hope, I hope\n\nAll of our homes have white fences\n\nI hope, I hope\n\nOur smiles are wider than theirs is\n\nI hope, I hope\n\nAll of our dreams are kept fragrant\n\nAnd I'll meet you on the pavement\n\nWhen we make it to the other side...\n\nHope we make it to the other side..."
