  "lyrics": "No flask can keep it\r\nBubble up and cut right through\r\nBut you're someone I believe in\r\nYou heat me like a filament\r\nAnytime you're in the room\r\nBut you burned me and I'm smoking\n\n\n\nI just wanted you to watch me dissolve slowly\n\nIn a pool full of your love\n\nBut I don't even know how the chemistry works\n\nWhen you're poolside\n\nKicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand\n\nAnd stirring up trouble\n\n\n\nCan't find an exit\n\nI wander in a maze alone\n\nIf I find you will you shock me?\n\nLeft, left and right, right\n\nPretty sure that I've been here before\n\nAnd it isn't what I wanted\n\n\n\nI just wanted you to watch me dissolve slowly\n\nIn a pool full of your love\n\nBut I don't even know how the chemistry works\n\nWhen you're poolside\n\nKicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand\n\nAnd stirring up trouble\n\n\n\nYour voice like an angel\n\nBeen chain smoking all month long\n\nLike you're someone I believe in\n\nYou held me, but I'm volatile\n\nAnd never got my head screwed on\n\nNow I'm melting through the floor\n\nAm I only a lab rat?\n\nSomeone you can test things on?\n\nAre you training for a new love?\n\nAll in white like you're an angel\n\nWith the sun glimmering off your glass mask\n\nThis isn't what I signed up for\n\n\n\nI just wanted you to watch me dissolve slowly\n\nIn a pool full of your love\n\nBut I don't even know how the chemistry works\n\nWhen you're poolside\n\nKicking in the dirt, kicking in the sand\n\nAnd stirring up trouble"
