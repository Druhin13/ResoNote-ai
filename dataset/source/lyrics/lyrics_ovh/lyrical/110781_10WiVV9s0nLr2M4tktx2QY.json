  "lyrics": "Look, straight up and down, I never did the crooked\r\nThey offered twenty, I'm worth more, I told my nigga, \"book it\"\r\nPraise God my position isn't make or break it\r\nI just wanted to spend the weekend in Spain\r\nI meant it nice, don't give a fuck about how niggas took it\r\nAwkward stares, like what the fuck you lookin' at?\n\nAnd that's all over the world\n\nI'm no nigga with dreams of bustin' all over your girl\n\nThat's belittling, bigger schemes, we been scribblin', notice it's plural\n\nDividends tricklin' three ways due to the penmanship\n\nI do shows in my leisure and all these sinks is residual\n\nPop out occasional for the sake of relationships\n\nSanitize after handshakes and treat the weed like it's Ritalin\n\nTryna give you a visual\n\nFuck all this censorship man, niggas too sensitive\n\nIf yo comfort ain't pivoting you ain't listenin' right\n\nGranny praying for it, she say we ain't Christian-ing right!\n\nEven water can't save mixin' dark with the light\n\nCorner the art with the business, no beauty mark, but my point is these niggas runnin' with scissors and headed straight for the plug\n\nMogul talkin' business movin' at the pace of a slug\n\nLeft a trail, had to bail, knew his heart wasn't in it\n\nHow you up, banger, then catch Parkinson's with it? I mean...\n\n*sigh*\n\nLot of y'all hear that line and gon' know it well\n\nI be on my show and prove, not much show-and-tell\n\nThen the whole defense about it be so Cole and Powell\n\n*sigh*\n\n\n\nI was speedin', had to slow it down\n\nOff the fertilizer, nigga growin' now\n\nI mean, enterprisin', been compartmentalizin' all my shit\n\nA tornado flew around my room before you came, I straightened it\n\nRight before yo eyes you see my stains, see me basically\n\nPickin' up the pieces"
