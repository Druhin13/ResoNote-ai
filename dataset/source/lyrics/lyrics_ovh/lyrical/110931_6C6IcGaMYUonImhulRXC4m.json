  "lyrics": "My true love is sitting on a pile of stones\r\nAnd he's wondering to himself\r\nOh where did I go wrong?\r\nMy true love has found himself alone\r\nAnd he's sorry for it all\n\nAnd for the hurt we've done\n\n\n\nAnd I've given more than I can take\n\nFallen for the same mistake\n\nPromises were made to break\n\nWhat will save us now?\n\n\n\nAnd I don't want to remember\n\nAnd I don't want to remember\n\n\n\nMy true love is a saccharine kind of pill\n\nThat tastes too sweet for words\n\nAnd cannot be fulfilled\n\n\n\nMy true love is a dangerous china cup\n\nWith all the broken pieces\n\nThat cannot be picked up\n\n\n\nNow all the colours left to run\n\nAll the dreams have been undone\n\nLove has left me standing here\n\nRaging at the sun\n\n\n\nAnd I don't want to remember\n\nAnd I don't want to remember"
