Better bow down!\r\nDead bodies all around, hundred rounds out\r\nSmell it in the air every time I fuck around town (downtown)\r\nLay down, one by one I pick 'em off without sound\n\nChoppa have my back, Grey slap hold on for the blade ($uicide!)\n\nYour chain snatched, I like the way it shines\n\nWhen I'm back the black blood diamonds glisten and hit the victims yell (what?)\n\nDeath requires singing all the songs of fucking hell\n\nAs I hear the voices swell I know the demons wish me well (yeah)\n\nBath salts in the nose, feel like eatin' a fucker's face\n\nNow I'm speedin in the bronco like it's 1998\n\nTake away the cameras, motherfucker, now it's war time\n\nBehind enemy lines, PTSD just means I'm high\n\nBring me life, bring me life, so I can end it on my own time\n\nMeeting the reaper, all they tryna take me off the frontlines\n\nI just want some peace of mind, sick and tired of feelin' tired\n\n\n\nI declare war, armageddon\n\nLet us swarm\n\nI'll bring the fucking storm, bury me in uniform, yeah\n\nFall under the rising sun\n\nG*59 the time has come\n\nWatch the blood, you maggot scum\n\nFeel the end as I return\n\nTonight we die, grey flags, wave 'em on\n\nPoint your guns up at the sky, yelling \"We know God is done!\"\n\nPartisan with fucking fur\n\nSmokin' ash all in my arm\n\nIt's war time, war fucking time!\n\nNow I wanna die\n\nFollow me, we can see the other side\n\nAnd if anyone's in the way, we'll rip out their spine\n\nLeave 'em behind, and repeat 'til we die\n\nGrey*59 army, we bleed 'til we die\n\nSix feets deep in my enemies, kill them all\n\nBurn it all, they're not new friends to me\n\nBitch, I'm in graves of the grave as I look and see\n\nWe were all too brand new, all an accident\n\nPeace, it will never be\n\nI used to lie in the seats underneath\n\nThe ground shoot off our brow, I'll see\n\nBleed out the lens while pressing my hand\n\nWhile he bury me in the sea and try not to forget me\n\n\n\nTry not to forget me, I'll become a ghost and haunt you daily\n\n(Hell no, we won't go, hell no, we won't go)\n\nDie until you remember me daily\n\n(Hell no, we won't go, hell no, we won't go)"
