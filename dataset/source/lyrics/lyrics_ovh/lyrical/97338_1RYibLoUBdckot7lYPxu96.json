  "lyrics": "In life, just be alone, though you're a wanderin' soul\r\nAnd you got to move on from the squandered soil\r\nWhen you get what you came here for\r\nWill you leave in the dead of night?\r\nIn the heart is a wall of horrors\r\nYou're the undenied\n\n\n\nCan't return the sacred time you steal\n\nA fact betrays the way you feel\n\nAnd the sight delays the right to heal\n\nYou decide to stay long\n\n\n\nI didn't plan to stay long\n\nI didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)\n\nI didn't plan to stay long\n\nI didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)\n\nIn the snake pit so long, I've got posters up (Stay long)\n\nBeen defending so long, I don't know how to stop\n\n\n\nHeart, tell them what you came for\n\nHeart, tell them what you came for\n\nHeart, tell them what you've been daydreamin' about\n\nWhat the evening's about to\n\n\n\nCan't return the sacred time you steal\n\nA fact betrays the way you feel\n\nAnd the sight delays the right to heal\n\nYou decide to stay long\n\n\n\nI didn't plan to stay long\n\nI didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)\n\nI didn't plan to stay long\n\nI didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)\n\nIn the snake pit so long, I've got posters up (Stay long)\n\nI've been defending so long, I don't know how to stop\n\nI'm so afraid\n\n\n\nTell them what you came for\n\nHeart, tell them what you came for\n\nHeart, tell them what you've been daydreamin' about\n\nWhat the evening's about to\n\n\n\nAhh, ahh, ahh\n\nAhh, ahh\n\nTell them what you came here for\n\nOh, oh, oh, stay long\n\nOh, oh, oh, stay long\n\nOh, oh, oh, stay long\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, long"
