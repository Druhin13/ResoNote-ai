  "lyrics": "I remember driving down the rutted roads late at night\r\nFollowing the summer moon bright as any pair of headlights\r\nI felt the air on my face and the night pressed inside my palm\r\nA moment captured in a place this memory stays strong\r\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nThe things that we are made of\n\n\n\nAnd I remember feeling I'm alive and in no need of saviors\n\nIf the past's another country I'm at the border with my papers\n\nWhere is your heart if not inside you where is home or are you lost\n\nWhere is love if not beside you I had no answers but they let me cross\n\n\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nThe things that we are made of\n\n\n\nLike the silence of my shadow when the twilight world is calling\n\nThe loneliness that knows me by the cadence of my walking\n\nAnd the scar upon my elbow and the sound of my own breathing\n\nMy reflection in a window and the way I'm always leaving\n\n\n\nAnd I remember wishing for some other life than this one I've claimed\n\nHow often have I been convinced how eagerly I'd make that trade\n\nThen all at once I see your face and the summer night and the open door\n\nDimmer now but not erased and I know what these are for\n\n\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nOh my darling oh my love\n\nThe things that we are made of"
