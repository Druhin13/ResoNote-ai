That's the sound of your heart\r\nThat's the ray of light pullin' Daddy outta the dark\n\nThat's the reason I've been happy, why I'm workin' so hard\n\nMy first letter to my boy and I dunno where to start\n\nDedicated to my son, my beautiful Bray\n\nIt's been a long 9 months, but you're due any day\n\nTryin' to tell you that I love you with this music I play\n\nYou made me focus on the world when I was losin' my way\n\nAs I write these words, you're in the other room\n\nAs cozy as could be, sleepin' in your mother's womb\n\nYou gettin' bigger by the minute, so I know you comin' soon\n\nI see you dancin' in the belly every time she hums a tune\n\nYeah, you just a baby, but one day you'll be a man\n\nAnd if you ever hear this song, then I hope you understand\n\nThere was a lotta things in this life that was bringin' me pain\n\nBut the second I heard your heartbeat, then everything changed\n\n\n\nMy baby boy\n\nAlways thinkin' of ya\n\nI'm just gonna love ya\n\nMore each day\n\nMy baby boy\n\nI just hope you'll hear me\n\nAs long as you're right near me\n\nYou'll be okay\n\n\n\nI thought I had it all, but you're givin' me more\n\nLookin' forward to watchin' you grow from the minute you're born\n\nLookin' at me while I'm cuttin' your umbilical cord\n\nYou know I'll always be there for you 'cause I been there before\n\nMy love for you is unconditional, the apple of my eye\n\nMy little guy, brighter than the star passin' thru the sky\n\nYou're the reason I'm alive, you're my passion and my drive\n\nAnd I'm probably gonna cry when you actually arrive\n\nThe excitement that I'm feelin', kinda hard to contain\n\nIt's like it's takin' over an entire part of my brain\n\nYou're like a sunbeam shinin' thru the darkness and rain\n\nAll the love I have for you is kinda hard to explain\n\nYeah, you just a baby, but one day you'll be a man\n\nAnd if you ever hear this song, then I hope you understand\n\nThere was a lotta things in this life that was bringin' me pain\n\nBut the second I heard your heartbeat, then everything changed\n\n\n\nMy baby boy\n\nAlways thinkin' of ya\n\nI'm just gonna love ya\n\nMore each day\n\nMy baby boy\n\nI just hope you'll hear me\n\nAs long as you're right near me\n\nYou'll be okay\n\n\n\nMy baby boy\n\nYou'll be okay\n\nMy baby boy\n\nYou'll be okay\n\nMy baby boy"
