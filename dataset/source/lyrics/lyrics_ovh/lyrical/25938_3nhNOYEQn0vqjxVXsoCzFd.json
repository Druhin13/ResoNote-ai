  "lyrics": "Tormenting silence\r\nThe endless days bleed into\r\nNights where I begin to fade away\r\nBurdened by failure, cannot remember\r\nWhy we hide within this fractured veil\n\nBorn of death, hiding just beneath the flesh\n\nDesolate, this heart yearns for a reprieve\n\nHow could I pray for salvation?\n\nWhen I'm the only mourner left to grieve\n\n\n\nBaptized in shadows\n\nCleaned by the pain I bury\n\nBetrayed, pretending I'm alive\n\n\n\nBorn of death, hiding just beneath the flesh\n\nDesolate, this heart yearns for a reprieve\n\nHow could I pray for salvation?\n\nWhen I'm the only mourner left to grieve\n\n\n\nThere he was laid to rest\n\n\n\nI'm dreaming of your call that will never come\n\nHolding on by a thread"
