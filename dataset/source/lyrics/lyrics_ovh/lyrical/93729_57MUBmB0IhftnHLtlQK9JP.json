  "lyrics": "When everything was broken\r\nThe Devil hit his second stride\r\nBut you remember what I told ya\r\nSomeday I'll need your spine to hide behind\r\nFor fear of moments stolen\r\nI don't wanna say goodnight\n\nBut I'll still see you in the morning\n\nStill know your heart and still know both your eyes\n\n\n\nI could've told you 'bout the long nights\n\nHow no one loves the birds that don't rise\n\nSo you can tell the heroes go hide\n\nMy sense of wonder's just a little tired\n\n\n\nIf only you could see yourself in my eyes\n\nYou'd see you shine, you shine\n\nAnd I know you'd never leave me behind\n\nBut I am lost this time\n\nAre we destined to burn, or will we last the night?\n\nI will hold you til I hold you right\n\nIf only you could see yourself in my eyes\n\nYou'd see you shine, you shine\n\n\n\nSo we'll run into the open\n\nKeep your hand inside of mine\n\nAnd then when everything is over\n\nI hope to think of this as better times\n\nThe sky got red and swollen\n\nI guess I never see the signs\n\nThere can't be songs for every soldier\n\nIt can't be solace every time you cry\n\n\n\nI could've told you 'bout the long nights\n\nHow no one loves the birds that don't rise\n\nSo you can tell the heroes go hide\n\nMy sense of wonder's just a little tired\n\n\n\nIf only you could see yourself in my eyes\n\nYou'd see you shine, you shine\n\nAnd I know you'd never leave me behind\n\nBut I am lost this time\n\nAre we destined to burn, or will we last the night?\n\nI will hold you til I hold you right\n\nIf only you could see yourself in my eyes\n\nYou'd see you shine, you shine\n\n\n\nI was lost 'til I found you\n\nNow these songs will hold and hide your name\n\nAll at once was all about you\n\nSince that night the moon has never seemed the same\n\n\n\nIf only you could see yourself in my eyes\n\nYou'd see you shine, you shine\n\nI know you'd never leave me behind\n\nBut I am lost this time\n\n\n\nWhat if the love you deserve is love you never find?\n\nI've learned in love and death we don't decide\n\nIf only you could see yourself in my eyes\n\nYou'd see you shine, you shine"
