  "lyrics": "I came with a little bit of sorrow\r\nWas maybe a bit to sad\r\nBut one day rolled into tomorrow\r\nAnd you gave me the best you had\r\nThat's how we started together\r\nAnd how together we're gonna stay\n\n\n\nYou taught me a little about good times\n\nI fought through a little bit of rain\n\nYou brought me a part of your sunshine\n\nYou took in the heart of my pain\n\nIt wasn't suppose to happen\n\nBut then it happened to come my way\n\n\n\nEvery night, every day, every word that you say\n\nMade it so\n\nEvery thought that I had, said I ought to be glad\n\nNow I know\n\n\n\nYou showed what a little bit of love can do\n\nYou opened my eyes and a light came through\n\nTook me to a place that I never knew\n\nGoodbye to a little bit of something blue\n\n\n\nYou came and you found me wanting\n\nAnd I'm saying I'm here in your debt\n\nSome days were a little bit daunting\n\nSome days I'd rather forget\n\nYou changed my life for the better\n\nAnd I know I'd better be good to you\n\n\n\nEvery night, every day, every word that you say\n\nMade it so\n\nEvery thought that I had, said I ought to be glad\n\nNow I know\n\n\n\nYou showed what a little bit of love can do\n\nYou opened my eyes and a light came through\n\nTook me to a place that I never knew\n\nSo long to a little bit of something blue\n\n\n\nIt wasn't suppose to happen\n\nBut then you happened to come my way\n\n\n\nEvery night, every day, every word that you say\n\nMade it so\n\nEvery thought that I had, said I ought to be glad\n\nNow I know\n\n\n\nYou showed what a little bit of love can do\n\nYou opened my eyes and a light came through\n\nTook me to a place that I never knew\n\nGoodbye to my little bit of something blue\n\nFarewell to my little bit of something blue\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Dolly for these lyrics)"
