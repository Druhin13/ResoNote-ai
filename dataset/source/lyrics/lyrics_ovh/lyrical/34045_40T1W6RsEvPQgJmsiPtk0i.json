  "lyrics": "There's a trio of trains twixt my work and my play\r\nOn my way to my playing, they tell me to pay\r\nSo when playing, I'm thinking about work the next day\r\nAnd the trio of trains to take me on my way\r\nIt's a trio of trains on a tangled up track\n\nTwirling and swirling into infinite black\n\nAnd I'm wishing I'd listened to the wisdom way back\n\nBefore that trio of trains tore and tangled the track\n\n\n\nThe infinite black of the path after dark\n\nAs shadows of the past pass unnoticed\n\nGlass-Hearted Lad stabs his own back in the passenger car\n\nGets discarded like trash 'tween the tracks in the yard\n\n\n\nThe tracks in the yard and the nails in the rails\n\nI am wailing and flailing, not failing to fail\n\nI'm not talking to talk, talking telling my tale\n\nOf a hand for a nail and an eye for a scale\n\n\n\nAn eye for a scale takes a weight one can see\n\nWon't you wait one more day, as patient as can be?\n\nPatience can be gracious--grateful are we, waiting, patiently aching\n\nIt's taking all week\n\n\n\nIt's taken all week, all of this aching I've done\n\nMaking my days go away one by one ain't my idea of fun\n\nBut I take as it comes\n\nAnd the scrape of the trains breaking wakes up the sun\n\n\n\nWon't you wake up, my sun? There's working to do\n\nWalking to my working will wear out my shoes\n\nI'll wear out my welcome, I'm certain it's true\n\nYou'll be worn out before I'm through talking to you\n\n\n\nI'm through talking to you--there's no more left to say\n\nMy words are all worthlessly murmured away\n\nAnd my gaze is returning once more towards the maze\n\nAnd the trio of trains twixt my work and my play\n\n\n\nThere's a trio of trains twixt my work and my play"
