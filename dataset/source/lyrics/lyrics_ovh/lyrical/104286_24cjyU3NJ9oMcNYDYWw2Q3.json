  "lyrics": "Oh sister,\r\nWhat's wrong with your mind?\r\nYou used to be so strong and stable.\r\nMy sister, What made you fall from grace?\r\nI'm sorry that I wasn't there to catch you.\n\nWhat have the demons done?\n\nWhat have the demons with the luminous light that once shined from your eyes?\n\nWhat makes you feel so alone?\n\nTo the whispering ghosts that you feel the most.\n\n\n\nBut the blackness in your heart won't last forever.\n\nI know it's tearing you apart,\n\nBut it's a storm you can weather.\n\n\n\nOh sister,\n\nThose lines etched in your hands\n\nWell they are harder than most\n\nLike the road map of sorrow\n\n\n\nMy sister,\n\nThere's sadness on your face.\n\nLike a motherless child whose longing for comfort.\n\n\n\nWhat's running through your veins?\n\nThats causing all this pain\n\nHas it something to do with the pills they gave to you\n\nWhat is eating at your soul?\n\nIs it the whispering ghost that let you out in the cold\n\n\n\nBut the blackness in your heart cannot last forever.\n\nI know it's tearing you apart\n\nBut it's a storm you can weather.\n\n\n\nOooooh Oooooh Oooooh Oh\n\nOh sister,\n\nMy sister."
