  "title": "You're the Reason I Come Home",
  "lyrics": "Watching you watching me,\r\nA fine way to fall asleep.\r\nThe neighbors fight,\r\nAs we both rest our eyes.\r\nHands in the fallen snow;\n\nNumb to the winter cold,\n\nBut we don't mind,\n\n'Cause we'll get warm inside.\n\n\n\nYou're the reason I come home.\n\nYou're the reason I come home, my love.\n\nYou're the reason that when everything I know falls apart...\n\nWell, you're the reason I come home.\n\n\n\nPaper doll silhouettes,\n\nFingertips on window glass;\n\nThe street's asleep,\n\nSo I breathe you in deep.\n\n\n\nThe tragedies of chemistry,\n\nPeople dream of what you and me \n\nHave found...\n\nEffortlessly.\n\n\n\nYou're the reason I come home.\n\nYou're the reason I come home, my love.\n\nYou're the reason that when everything I know falls apart...\n\nWell, you're the reason I come home.\n\n\n\nAnd for a long time, I remember,\n\nSaying prayers for something perfect,\n\nSaying prayers for someone kind.\n\nIt's in my head,\n\nWe're spinning circles down the avenues instead.\n\n\n\nYou're the reason I come home.\n\nYou're the reason I come home, my love.\n\nYou're the reason that when everything I know falls apart...\n\nWell, you're the reason I come home\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Jessie for these lyrics)"
