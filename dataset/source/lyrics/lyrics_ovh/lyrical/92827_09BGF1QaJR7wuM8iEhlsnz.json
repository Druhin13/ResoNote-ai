  "lyrics": "White roses on a pastel sky\r\nBroken vows on our lips run dry\r\nI see you out with your friends, you smile\r\nIt's funny how that goes, I haven't slept in a while\r\nI never saw it coming\n\nI thought we had it all\n\nI feel you in those moments\n\nThose nights, held in your arms\n\n\n\nDarling be careful with me 'cause there's part of me that you don't know\n\nDarling be gentle with me when you tell me that you need to go\n\nAnd if you should miss me, don't call me, don't tell me, just leave me alone\n\nBecause you cut me wide open left teardrops on all my white roses\n\n'Cause you cut me wide open left teardrops on all my white roses\n\n\n\nSame places on a Friday night\n\nHolding glances but we're tongue-tied\n\nI'm with my friends, and it's hard to smile\n\nIt's crazy how that feels, I haven't slept in a while\n\n\n\nI never saw it coming\n\nI thought we had it all\n\nI feel you in those moments\n\nThose nights, held in your arms\n\n\n\nDarling be careful with me 'cause there's part of me that you don't know\n\nDarling be gentle with me when you tell me that you need to go\n\nAnd if you should miss me, don't call me, don't tell me, just leave me alone\n\nBecause you cut me wide open left teardrops on all my white roses\n\n'Cause you cut me wide open left teardrops on all my white roses\n\n\n\nI want to believe that maybe it's just emotion\n\nBut I cannot see my life without you, those moments\n\nSo wild and free, blinded by love, devoted\n\nBut now it's just me, unspoken words, white roses\n\n\n\nDarling be careful with me 'cause there's part of me that you don't know\n\nDarling be gentle with me when you tell me that you need to go\n\nAnd if you should miss me, don't call me, don't tell me, just leave me alone\n\nBecause you cut me wide open left teardrops on all my white roses"
