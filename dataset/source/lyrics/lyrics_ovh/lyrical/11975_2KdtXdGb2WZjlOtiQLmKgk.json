  "lyrics": "When you're out in the sticks\r\nAnd you're all but lost\r\nThe sun is dead\r\nIn a world of frost\r\nFollow Polaris\r\nOn the Northern route\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\n\n\nThey've beaten you down\n\nAnd you can't get up\n\nStolen your horses\n\nAnd they smashed your cup\n\nLook up above\n\nThere can be no doubt\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\n\n\nYou harness the light\n\nThe lookout glows\n\nGather the children\n\nAnd hold them close\n\nAnd teach of love (teach of love)\n\nAnd peace devout (and peace devout)\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\n\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\n\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out\n\n\n\nWhen it grows darkest\n\nThe stars come out"
