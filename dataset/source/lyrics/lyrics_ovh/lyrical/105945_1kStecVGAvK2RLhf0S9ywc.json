  "lyrics": "The trains are gone, the trains are gone\r\nSpent like the coal they once rolled on\r\nThe rails don't hum, the bows don't [?]\r\nNo brake-men yodelin' those rail yard songs\r\nGranddad's ranch dried up fast\n\nOl' Johnny Chisum, he's seen to that\n\nHe's seen to that, matter of fact\n\nJust as sure as Billy-boy got slain by Pat\n\n\n\nI know I'm young, I know I'm young\n\nI've seen too few a settin' sun\n\nBut the more I run the changes come\n\nSwift as a freight train, the kind that's gone\n\n\n\nThe trains are gone, the trains are gone\n\nSpent like the coal they once rolled on"
