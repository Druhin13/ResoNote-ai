  "lyrics": "The moonâ€”\r\nFirst time I heard your voice\r\nMoonlight burst into the room\r\nAnd I saw your eyesAnd I saw your smileAnd the world opened wide\r\nAnd the world was inside of me\n\nAnd I catch my breath\n\nAnd I laugh and blush\n\nAnd I hear guitars\n\nYou are so good for me\n\n\n\nI love you, I love you, I love you, I love you\n\nI love you\n\n\n\nOh, the moon\n\nOh, the snow in the moonlight\n\nAnd your childlike eyes\n\nAnd your distant smile\n\nI'll never be this happy again\n\nYou and I\n\nAnd no one else\n\n\n\nWe've done this all before\n\nWe were angels once\n\nDon't you remember?\n\nJoy and life\n\nInside our souls\n\nAnd nobody knows\n\nJust you and me\n\nIt's our secret\n\n\n\nThis winter sky\n\nHow can anyone sleep?\n\nThere was never such a night before!\n\nI feel like putting my arms round my knees\n\nAnd squeezing tight as possible\n\nAnd flying away\n\nLike this...\n\n\n\nOh, the moon\n\nOh, the snow in the moonlight\n\nAnd your childlike eyes\n\nAnd your distant smile\n\nI'll never be this happy again\n\nYou and I\n\nYou and I\n\nYou and I\n\nAnd no one else\n\n\n\nMaybe he'll come today\n\nMaybe he came already\n\nAnd he's sitting in the drawing room\n\nAnd I simply forgot"
