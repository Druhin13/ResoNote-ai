  "lyrics": "I'm sick of biting my tongue\r\nI'm sick of hiding; and eggshells\r\nHurt like hell underneath my feet\r\nSometimes I just wanna run\r\nI'm sick of trying to live life on the edge of a broken seat\r\nBut it's time for the glass to crack\n\n'Cause I love imperfection\n\nEven facts should be questioned\n\n\n\nI know I said I'd play by the rules\n\nDo what they'd want me to do\n\nAnd I'd color inside the lines\n\nBut I lied, I changed my mind\n\nAnd I'm all out of fucks, don't care\n\nMiddle fingers up in the air\n\nI know I said I'd rather live a lie than die\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\n\n\nBut I changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nChanged my mind, oh I changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nChanged my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\n\n\nNo more comparing myself\n\nNo more competing\n\nThe only one I'll answer to is me\n\nI left my fucks on a shelf\n\nSitting there next to your vision\n\nYour religion, I don't believe\n\nYou can try to clip my wings\n\nBut I'll fly on the ground\n\nGravity won't hold me down\n\n\n\nI know I said I'd play by the rules\n\nDo what they'd want me to do\n\nAnd I'd color inside the lines\n\nBut I lied, I changed my mind\n\nAnd I'm all out of fucks, don't care\n\nMiddle fingers up in the air\n\nI know I said I'd rather live a lie than die\n\nBut I changed my mind\n\n\n\nBut I changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nBut I changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nChanged my mind, oh I changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nChanged my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\n\n\nBut I changed my\n\nChanged my mind, oh I changed my, changed my, changed my mind\n\nChanged my, changed my, changed my, changed my mind"
