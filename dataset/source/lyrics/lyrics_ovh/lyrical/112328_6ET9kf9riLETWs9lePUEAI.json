  "lyrics": "Born in a hurry, always late\r\nHaven't been early since '88\r\nTexas is hot, I can be cold\r\nGrandma cried when I pierced my nose\r\nGood in a glass, good on green\r\nGood when you're putting your hands all over me\n\n\n\nI'm alright with a slow burn\n\nTaking my time, let the world turn\n\nI'm gonna do it my way; it'll be alright\n\nIf we burn it down and it takes all night\n\nIt's a slow burn, yeah\n\n\n\nIn Tennessee, the sun's goin' down\n\nBut in Beijing, they're heading out to work\n\nYou know the bar down the street don't close for an hour\n\nWe should take a walk and look at all the flowers\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn\n\nTaking my time, let the world turn\n\nI'm gonna do it my way; it'll be alright\n\nIf we burn it down and it takes all night\n\nIt's a slow burn\n\n\n\nWhatever feels good\n\n\n\nOld soul, waiting my turn\n\nI know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn\n\nSo I'm alright with a slow burn\n\nSlow burn\n\nSlow burn\n\nI'm alright with a slow burn"
