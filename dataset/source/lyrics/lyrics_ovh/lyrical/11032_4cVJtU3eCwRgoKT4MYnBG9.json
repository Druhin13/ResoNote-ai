  "lyrics": "Round the time that the cacti wakes up\r\nAnd the night owl opens its eyes\r\nI'll be waiting by the rocks on top of the hill\r\nWith a glow stick map of the sky\r\nOh I've got a surprise\r\nOh I've got a surprise\n\n\n\nFour o-clock on the balcony with dad\n\nI was just a wide-eyed kiddy with questions asked\n\n“who made skin and painted my eyelids?\n\nInside of my iris and spaced my thighs, hips?”\n\nAmazing scientists couldn't solve or make the math of it\n\nHe's like “of course it's given you proof\n\nNever ask a human first, look up at the universe it's speaking to you”\n\n“Oh Word?”\n\nEver since that day I don't pray, but study the pattern of bird flight\n\nThe number of female bees in a beehive divided by the males\n\nEquates like 1. 618 03 now see I'm\n\nLaying out on the ground that we have been designed\n\nBut we won't be defined and I will not decline\n\nWhen all of you look at money you never could see time\n\n\n\nThis​ ​is​ ​just​ ​a​ ​letter​ ​for​ ​God\n\nAnd​ ​all​ ​time​ ​space​ ​beings​ ​that​ ​are​ ​littered​ ​abroad\n\nI​ ​don't​ ​wanna​ ​see​ ​no​ ​tunnel​ ​of​ ​light\n\nMore​ ​so​ ​just​ ​a​ ​run​ ​up​ ​and​ ​a​ ​summary​ ​why\n\nNo​ ​questions​ ​asked​ ​in​ ​the​ ​class​ ​or​ ​church\n\nMany​ ​left​ ​unanswered,​ ​pass​ ​the​ ​word\n\nI​ ​wanna​ ​know​ ​why​ ​earth​ ​fills​ ​greed​ ​and​ ​hate\n\nThrust​ ​me​ ​out​ ​there​ ​with​ ​the​ ​solar​ ​waste​ ​and​ ​let​ ​go\n\n\n\nWhen the world burns down into ash\n\nDo you sit back and roll the dice\n\nOr do you play it by the rules and give a fuck about us\n\nAnd kick your feet back on to sky\n\nOh please tell me why\n\n\n\nPlease tell me why\n\nI, I was born a misfit, could never understand why the world’s sadistic\n\nA kid, the dipshit who would take the piss of anybody in a fundamental clique religion\n\nBut now I just let ‘em feel safe ‘cause they just want to be held and blame the devil for their own\n\nMistakes Why bother?\n\nI know the planets around the sun, we are not of this earth\n\nAll we think about is economy worth and our sums\n\nBut summed up, half of the poverty and the slum are some real design, God’s son\n\nHow we end up with a mass disease? so many loved ones deceased without one, how come?\n\nThe real sums inside of an insect, the side of a man’s face and body just try to inspect\n\nThe number’s 1.618, i'm tryna understand why the fuck we great\n\n\n\nThis​ ​is​ ​just​ ​a​ ​letter​ ​for​ ​God\n\nAnd​ ​all​ ​time​ ​space​ ​beings​ ​that​ ​are​ ​littered​ ​abroad\n\nI​ ​don't​ ​wanna​ ​see​ ​no​ ​tunnel​ ​of​ ​light\n\nMore​ ​so​ ​just​ ​a​ ​run​ ​up​ ​and​ ​a​ ​summary​ ​why\n\nNo​ ​questions​ ​asked​ ​in​ ​the​ ​class​ ​or​ ​church\n\nMany​ ​left​ ​unanswered,​ ​pass​ ​the​ ​word\n\nI​ ​wanna​ ​know​ ​why​ ​earth​ ​fills​ ​greed​ ​and​ ​hate\n\nThrust​ ​me​ ​out​ ​there​ ​with​ ​the​ ​solar​ ​waste​ ​and​ ​let​ ​go"
