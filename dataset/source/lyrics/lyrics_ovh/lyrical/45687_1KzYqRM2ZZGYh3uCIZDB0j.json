  "lyrics": "(Michael McDonald & Kenny Loggins) \nHe came from somewhere back in her long ago \nThe sentimental fool don't see \nTryin' hard to recreate \nWhat had yet to be created once in her life \n\n\n\nShe musters a smile \n\nFor his nostalgic tale \n\nNever coming near what he wanted to say \n\nOnly to realize \n\nIt never really was \n\n\n\nShe had a place in his life \n\nHe never made her think twice \n\nAs he rises to her apology \n\nAnybody else would surely know \n\nHe's watching her go \n\n\n\nBut what a fool believes he sees \n\nNo wise man has the power to reason away \n\nWhat seems to be \n\nIs always better than nothing \n\nAnd nothing at all keeps sending him: \n\n\n\nSomewhere back in her long ago \n\nWhere he can still believe there's a place in her life \n\nSomeday, somewhere, she will return \n\n\n\nShe had a place in his life \n\nHe never made her think twice \n\nAs he rises to her apology \n\nAnybody else would surely know \n\nHe's watching her go \n\n\n\nBut what a fool believes he sees \n\nNo wise man has the power to reason away \n\nWhat seems to be \n\nIs always better than nothing \n\nThere's nothing at all \n\nBut what a fool believes he sees"
