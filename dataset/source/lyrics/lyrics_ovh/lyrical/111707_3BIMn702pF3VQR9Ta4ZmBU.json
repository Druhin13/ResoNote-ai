  "lyrics": "New York City is the loneliest town\r\nUnless you happen to be lost in L.A.\r\nBut nothing matters much\r\nWhen you're not around\r\nLong nights, hold on\r\nLong nights, hold on\n\n\n\nI've been a traveler\n\nAnd I've lived in a cave\n\nIt doesn't matter\n\nWhen there's someone who cares\n\nBut you're alone now\n\nAnd you've got to be brave\n\nLong nights, hold on\n\nLong nights, hold on\n\n\n\nWhy am I awake at night?\n\nWhat good does it do\n\nClose my eyes and all I see is you\n\n\n\nBut New York City is a happening town\n\nAnd L.A. still can wear a smile on her face\n\nWait till morning and you turn it around\n\nLong nights, hold on\n\nLong nights, hold on\n\n\n\nWhy am I awake at night?\n\nWhat good does it do\n\nClose my eyes and all I see is you\n\n\n\nBut New York City can be happy at times\n\nYou only need to have somebody you love\n\nGive me love and I'm doin' just fine\n\nLong nights, hold on\n\nLong nights. hold on\n\nLong nights, hold on\n\nLong nights, hold on"
