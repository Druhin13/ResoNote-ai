  "lyrics": "My friend, I always knew that this would bring us to the end\r\nAnd maybe one day you’ll see clearly\r\nLiving in your head won’t give you feelings\r\nDoing what you’re told isn’t fucking dreaming\r\nOver and over, you’re dead\n\nI think you’re caving under pressure\n\nIt’s hard to catch up when you’re falling back, falling backwards\n\nYou wake up every day and it’s the same old shit\n\nNow you’re on your own you’ll pay the price for misleading me\n\nI hope you’re happy stuck inside your head\n\n\n\nOld friend, this time your judgement’s gonna plague you to the end\n\nAnd maybe one day, you’re gonna listen\n\nAll you see is red cause you can’t be happy\n\nPredetermined lies are killing you slowly\n\nOver and over, you’re dead\n\n\n\nI think you’re caving under pressure\n\nIt’s hard to catch up when you’re falling back, falling backwards\n\nYou wake up every day and it’s the same old shit\n\nNow you’re on your own you’ll pay the price for misleading me\n\nI hope you’re happy stuck inside your head\n\n\n\nI want to feel alive, not live amongst the dead\n\nThe world is better lost in my dreams instead\n\nYou can’t accept the life I always wished you had\n\nIt’s sad to say the least, stuck inside your head\n\n\n\nI think you’re caving under pressure\n\nIt’s hard to catch up when you’re falling back, falling backwards\n\nYou wake up every day and it’s the same old shit\n\nNow you’re on your own you’ll pay the price for misleading me\n\nI hope you’re happy stuck inside your head\n\nYou’ve made up your mind now"
