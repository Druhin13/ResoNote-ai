  "lyrics": "To be alone together just once again\r\nIs something that is sure to happen sometime\r\nIf my hands can't stay on the table\r\nAnd if I find myself unable\r\nTo look away from staring in your eyes\r\nAnd the color of the sunrise inside\n\nI promise that I'll hold myself together\n\nAnd act like this isn't killing me\n\nI saw you once today\n\nI painfully watched as you looked the other way\n\nAfraid just to notice me standing there\n\nYou would make it obvious, you don't care\n\nI won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak\n\nI only love you for the give and the take\n\nNo, you know I want it\n\nI'm in love with the thought of everything\n\nI am lifted to a holy ground\n\nAnd from up here can see a little of everything\n\nAnd I can see you don't want me around\n\nAnd I know how much that it makes you cringe\n\nTo think about you and I as friends\n\nTogether, forever, until the end\n\nAfter that, you won't have to see me again\n\nI won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak\n\nI only love you for the give and the take\n\nNo, you know I want it\n\nAnd when I die, just rip my heart out from my chest\n\nAnd put it in a mason jar left to rest on your bedside table\n\nAnd if there's any hope alive after all\n\nI would hold it like a newborn baby\n\nAnd care for it like it was my own\n\nHey, you know, it looks kinda like me\n\nAnd we'd still get chills every time we kiss\n\nAnd I will always promise this, that to you I will never tell a lie\n\nNo, not to you\n\nNo, not to you\n\nI won't lie, I only love you for the heartbreak\n\nI only love you for the give and the take\n\nNo, you know I want it\n\nAnd when I die, just rip my heart out from my chest\n\nAnd put it in a mason jar left to rest on your bedside table\n\nAnd put it in a mason jar left to rest on your bedside table"
