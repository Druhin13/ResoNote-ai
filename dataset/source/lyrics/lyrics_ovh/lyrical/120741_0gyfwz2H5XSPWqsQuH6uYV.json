  "lyrics": "Looks like this place is closing it down\r\nWe're the only two other people still hanging around\r\nBartender don't get too far away\r\nNo, we don't need another drink\r\nGirl I'm afraid of what I might say\n\nI can't trust myself alone with you\n\nI keep thinking about you thinking it too\n\nI couldn't stop myself from doing what I want to do to you\n\nI can't trust myself\n\nNo, I can't trust myself alone with you\n\n\n\nIs it too late now to call up a couple good friends\n\nHop on a subway train, pray that somebody else is getting it\n\nWe're not drunk enough to think this is right\n\nYou should go home to yours and I should go home to mine\n\n\n\n'Cause I can't trust myself alone with you\n\nI keep thinking about you thinking it too\n\nI couldn't stop myself from doing what I want to do to you\n\nI can't trust myself\n\nNo, I can't trust myself\n\n\n\nI know I can't stay but I don't want to leave\n\nNo, we couldn't make it through one more drink\n\n\n\nOh no, I can't trust myself alone with you\n\nI keep thinking about you thinking it too\n\nI couldn't stop myself from doing what I want to do to you\n\nI can't trust myself\n\nNo, I can't trust myself\n\nI can't trust myself alone with you"
