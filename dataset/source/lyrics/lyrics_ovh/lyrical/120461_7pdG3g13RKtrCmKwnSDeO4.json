  "lyrics": "The truth is like when I am killing in order to survive\r\nI have never felt so alive\r\nI am always seeking to live and die on the edge\r\nLife is a broken simulation I'm unable to feel\r\nI'm searching for something that's real\r\nI am always seeking to see what's behind the veil\n\n\n\nTrapped in a maze of unseen walls\n\nThese blockades must fall\n\n\n\nCrush, crush\n\nWhere's the rush?\n\nSeize, fight for your life\n\nSmash, test\n\nBeat the best\n\nFight for your life\n\nLeave me inside now\n\n\n\nI never sleep or rest\n\nBut I'm still running out of time\n\nI have sacrificed all of my life\n\nThe time has come to\n\nTo prove to you what I'm worth\n\n\n\nTrapped in a maze of endless walls\n\nThese blockades must fall\n\n\n\nCrush, crush\n\nWhere's the rush?\n\nSeize, fight for your life\n\nSmash, test\n\nBeat the best\n\nFight for your life\n\nLeave me inside now\n\n\n\nCrush, crush\n\nWhere is the rush?\n\nSeize, fight for your life\n\nSmash, test\n\nBeat the best\n\nFight for your life\n\nLeave me inside now"
