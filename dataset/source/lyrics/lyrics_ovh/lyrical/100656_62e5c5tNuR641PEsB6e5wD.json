  "lyrics": "Do you believe in something beautiful\r\nBetween chaos and the light\r\nYou gave it all for something you once sold\r\nThe truth be told you lied\r\nIf it's the taste you remember\n\nYou may not share in this sweet delight\n\nYeah we can live forever\n\nIf there's a time we can get it right\n\n\n\nRoll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya\n\nDo with me what you will\n\nHold me under, the water running over\n\nDo with me what you will\n\n\n\nAre you receiving nothing once again\n\nIs there shame for what's been done\n\nIt screams so loud that you can't begin\n\n'Cuz you're always on the run\n\n\n\nIf it's the taste you remember\n\nYou may not share in this sweet delight\n\nYeah we can live forever\n\nIf there's a time we can get it right\n\n\n\nRoll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya\n\nDo with me what you will\n\nHold me under, the water running over\n\nDo with me what you will\n\n\n\nRoll me under, I'll pull the trigger for ya\n\nDo with me what you will\n\nHold me under, the water running over\n\nDo with me what you will\n\nDo with me what you will"
