  "lyrics": "Memories are all we leave\r\nFragments of lost melancholy\r\nTraces of a generation gone\r\nTiny pieces of broken glass\r\nSh-sh-sh-shining like golden glitter\n\nLooking up at the dying stars\n\nUnloved by all who pass this way\n\nI never really got a chance to say\n\n\n\nLike islands in the stream\n\nThat get washed away\n\nOne more time in\n\nThe ghetto you see\n\nI convinced myself\n\nThat I don't walk the line\n\nI've never deserted\n\nBy luck or by design\n\n\n\nA song for the sadness\n\nTo clear away the madness\n\nA song for the sadness\n\nA song for the sadness\n\n\n\nHe made me with a true kindness\n\nThat I still feel runs through my flesh\n\nOut of us time made such a mess\n\nI can't ignore and I must confess\n\n\n\nLike islands in the stream\n\nThat get washed away\n\nOne more time in\n\nThe ghetto you see\n\nI convinced myself\n\nThat I have walked a line\n\nI've never deserted\n\nBy lack or by design\n\n\n\nA song for the sadness\n\nTo clean away the badness\n\nA song for the sadness\n\nA song for the sadness\n\n\n\nA song for the sadness\n\nTo clean away the madness\n\nA song for the sadness\n\nA song for the sadness"
