  "lyrics": "Been up since the crack of dawn\r\nJust trying to get paid\r\nBeen hotter than a hundred suns\r\nI can't find no shade\r\nJust two more rows and I'm good to go\r\nYeah, I'm shutting this tractor down\n\nGet me a half an hour for a shave and a shower\n\nAnd I'll be outside your house\n\n\n\nMight have a little dirt on my boots\n\nBut I'm taking you uptown tonight\n\nMight have a little mud on my wheels\n\nBut they're gonna shine with you up inside\n\nGonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug\n\nBurn it up like neon lights\n\nMight have a little dirt on my boots\n\nBut we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight\n\nGot a little dirt on my boots\n\n\n\nHard as I worked all day\n\nI'm gonna work harder loving on you\n\nSpin you all over that dance floor\n\nRight out of them high heel shoes\n\nAnd when you're ready to quit\n\nBaby, we can slip right out of that barroom door\n\nAnd when I take you home, don't worry babe\n\nI'm gonna kick them off on the porch\n\n\n\nMight have a little dirt on my boots\n\nBut I'm taking you uptown tonight\n\nMight have a little mud on my wheels\n\nBut they're gonna shine with you up inside\n\nGonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug\n\nBurn it up like neon lights\n\nMight have a little dirt on my boots\n\nBut we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight\n\nGot a little dirt on my boots\n\n\n\nA little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing\n\nI can get cleaned up if you ask me\n\nBut I can only get so fancy\n\n\n\nMight have a little dirt on my boots\n\nBut I'm taking you uptown tonight\n\nMight have a little mud on my wheels\n\nBut they're gonna shine with you up inside\n\nGonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug\n\nBurn it up like neon lights\n\nMight have a little dirt on my boots\n\nBut we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight\n\nGot a little dirt on my boots\n\nGot a little dirt on my boots\n\nGot a little dirt on my boots"
