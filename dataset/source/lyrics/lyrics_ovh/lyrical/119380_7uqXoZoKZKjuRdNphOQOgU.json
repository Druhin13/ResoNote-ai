  "lyrics": "All around me smoke is heavy\r\nGoing down deep, I'm not ready\r\nYou're world is burning but I don't really care\r\nI'm just waiting for you to be there\r\nSilence is screaming, I just can't relax (just can't relax)\r\nCurrent so strong and you're pulling me back\n\n\n\n'Cause when I fall and hit the wall\n\nThe only escape is your voice in the rain\n\nAnd that's when you whisper\n\n\n\nAnd that's when you whisper\n\nAnd that's when you whisper\n\n\n\nUsed to be so insecure\n\nAlways drowning in that storm\n\nThe sky is falling but you held up the end\n\nNow I'm feeling you everywhere\n\nSilence is screaming, I just can't relax (just can't relax)\n\nCurrent so strong and you're pulling me back\n\n\n\n'Cause when I fall and hit the wall\n\nThe only escape is your voice in the rain\n\nAnd that's when you whisper\n\n\n\nAnd that's when you whisper\n\nAnd that's when you whisper"
