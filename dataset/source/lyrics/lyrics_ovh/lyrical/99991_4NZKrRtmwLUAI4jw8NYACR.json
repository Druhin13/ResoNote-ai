  "lyrics": "People, we're only people\r\nThere's not much anyone can do, really do about that\r\nBut it hasn't stopped us yet\r\nPeople, we know so little about ourselves\r\nBut just enough to wanna be nearly anybody else\r\nHow does that add up?\n\n\n\nOh, friends, all my friends\n\nOh, I hope you're somewhere smiling\n\nJust know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been\n\nAnd I'll see you the next time around the bend\n\n\n\nPeople, what's the deal?\n\nYou've been hurt\n\nAnd I've been hurt\n\nBut what do we do now?\n\nPeople, we're only people\n\nThere ain't a thing one person can ever change about that\n\n\n\nOh, friends, all my friends\n\nOh, I hope you're somewhere smiling\n\nJust know I think about you more kindly than you and I have ever been\n\nAnd I'll see you the next time around the bend\n\n\n\nI think the end of it all may look a lot like the beginning\n\nPassed around from hand to hand\n\nScreaming for no particular reason\n\nThe company gets pretty thin\n\nSo we start to shed all our distinctions\n\nSo why not me?\n\nWhy not you?\n\nWhy not now?"
