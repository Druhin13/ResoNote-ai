  "lyrics": "My twenty-fourth birthday, the day I was inscribed\r\nWith the sacred emblem I will wear until I die\r\nMy twenty-fourth birthday, I made my solemn vow\r\nPraying, \"may I never know more than I know now\"\r\nMy right arm, I dedicated to that noble cause\n\nTo dismantle authority and nullify all laws\n\nAnd construct in their vacancy a kinder, juster world\n\nOne human race united beneath the black flag unfurled\n\n\n\nThe piercing of the needle as tainted blood runs clean\n\nThe shattering of shackles hithertofore unseen\n\nThe thrill of knowing purpose, of wondering no more\n\nThe journey laid before me at only twenty-four\n\n\n\nRight arm, do no evil--right arm, please be true\n\nRight arm, swing for righteousness--you wear a Crass tattoo"
