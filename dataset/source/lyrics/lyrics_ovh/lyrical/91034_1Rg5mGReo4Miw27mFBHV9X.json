Amen\n\n\n\nAin't no cage that can hold us\n\nAin't no hate that can fold us\n\nPut on the chains and we'll break'em\n\nThey wanna battle we'll take em\n\nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee\n\nThey can't keep us on a leash\n\n\n\nThe kings of our little towns\n\nIf there's a rebel around you know it's gonna be one of us\n\nWe're right at home in the wild\n\nCan't help, but that's our style\n\nBorn and bred to be dangerous\n\nWe will roll\n\nOn a Saturday night get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning\n\nSome may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud\n\nWell there's lambs and there's lions\n\n\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\n\n\nOur heads are down with our eyes up\n\nJust like the sun and horizon\n\nThey'll think twice going to size up\n\nYou'll second thought then you'll wise up\n\n\n\nThe kings of our little towns\n\nIf there's a rebel around you know it's gonna be one of us\n\nWe're right at home in the wild\n\nCan't help, but that's our style\n\nBorn and bred to be dangerous\n\nWe will roll\n\nOn a Saturday night get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning\n\nSome may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud\n\nWell there's lambs and there's lions\n\n\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\n\n\nFloat like a butterfly, sting like a bee\n\nThey can't keep us on a leash\n\nWhich one are you gonna be?\n\n\n\nThe kings of our little towns\n\nIf there's a rebel around you know it's gonna be one of us\n\nWe're right at home in the wild\n\nCan't help, but that's our style\n\nBorn and bred to be dangerous\n\nWe will roll\n\nOn a Saturday night get that look in our eyes and we're striking like lightning\n\nSome may say we're too loud, some may say we're too proud\n\nWell there's lambs and there's lions\n\n\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions\n\nWe are lions, we are lions"
