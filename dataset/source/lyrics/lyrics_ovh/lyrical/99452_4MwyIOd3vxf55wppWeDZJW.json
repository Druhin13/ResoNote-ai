  "lyrics": "Darkness depends on where you're standing\r\nJump the creek and watch the sunshine swim\r\nYou found inner-peace in the inner northeast\r\nGotta a momentary bend\r\nGive me dreams, upstream, low dan-tian screaming\n\nYou gotta learn your place\n\nDon't let it go to waste\n\nHumble but hungry, need validation\n\n\n\nYou catch the moon so carefully\n\nBreath out, breath in\n\nThis target forgets patience\n\nPull back and release\n\nThe sign on the shelf says:\n\n\"Please help your self\"\n\n\n\nWon't you tell me something new?\n\nYou're in tune with who surrounds you\n\n\n\nYou gotta learn your place\n\nDon't let it go to waste\n\nHumble but hungry, need validation\n\nYou gotta lot on your mind\n\nYou know they're half the time\n\nIt's only half as true\n\nDon't let it swallow you\n\n\n\nYou gotta learn your place\n\nDon't let it go to waste\n\nHumble but hungry, need validation\n\nYou gotta lot on your mind\n\nYou know they're half the time\n\nIt's only half as true\n\nDon't let it swallow you"
