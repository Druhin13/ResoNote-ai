  "lyrics": "When the going gets tough, the tough become an addict\r\nBuried down hard on a horrible line\r\nDemonic by the dawn, lead me to the attic\r\nI don't wanna be dead, but I'm barely alive\r\nSo settle up mother, join the schizophrenic\r\nIt's a goddamn shame what you're doing to me\n\nGiving up ghosts, taking all the credit\n\nAnother fine job, just abandon the dream\n\n\n\nI can't decide whichever one is better\n\nUndefined, you've gotta spell it out\n\nWhy am I continuing to wither?\n\nI'm into it, I'm into it\n\nI don't need information\n\nI don't need irritation\n\n\n\nUnderneath the fog is just another killer\n\nReliable amalgam with a comical phase\n\nWhere do I stop? God, I sound bitter\n\nForget about the innocent and go to your cage\n\nHere we go again, a simple motherfucker\n\nWho is out of this world and into the kink\n\nKeep it in your pants, can I get an amen?\n\nDon't even bother cause they tell you what to think\n\n\n\nDecide whichever one is better\n\nUndefined, you've gotta spell it out\n\nWhy am I continuing to wither?\n\nI'm into it, I'm into it\n\nI don't need information\n\nI don't need irritation\n\n\n\nJust once I'd like to know\n\nWhere the pain, the shame, and the spirit will go\n\nLooks like I'm here to stay\n\nAnother bloody mess who's ready to be saved\n\n\n\nDecide whichever one is better\n\nUndefined, you've gotta spell it out\n\nWhy am I continuing to wither?\n\nI'm into it, I'm into it\n\nI don't need information\n\nI don't need irritation\n\n\n\nJust once I'd like to know\n\nWhere the pain, the shame, and the spirit will go\n\nLooks like I'm here to stay\n\nAnother bloody mess who's ready to be saved\n\n\n\nWho's gonna save me?\n\nWho's gonna save me?\n\nWho's gonna save me?\n\nWho's gonna save me?"
