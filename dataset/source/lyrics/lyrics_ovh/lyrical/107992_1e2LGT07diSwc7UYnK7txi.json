  "lyrics": "Floating around in a vacuum of space\r\nEverything here it all looks the same\r\nLike aisles and aisles of boxes and cans\r\nEverything is just more of the same thing\r\nI go to a friend of a friends party\n\nEveryones well dressed with a perfect body\n\nAnd they all have alternative hair cuts and straight white teeth\n\nBut all I see is just more of the same thing\n\n\n\nWoah, just a little is more than I can recall\n\nI try and put my finger on it though I have been here before\n\nI'm never gonna figure it out, no I'm never gonna try again\n\nIf all it is, is just more of the same thing\n\n\n\nIn the classroom, trying to believe in\n\nThe words on a page of a book that I'm reading\n\nSpread out by a woman who became a teacher\n\n'Cause she couldn't make ends meet from her writing career\n\n\n\nWoah, just a little is more than I can recall\n\nI try and put my finger on it though I have been here before\n\nI'm never gonna figure it out, no I'm never gonna try again\n\nIf all it is, is just more of the same thing\n\n\n\nJust a little is more than I can recall\n\nI try and put my finger on it though I have been here before\n\nI'm never gonna figure it out, no I'm never gonna try again\n\nIf all it is, is just more of the same thing\n\nMore of the same thing"
