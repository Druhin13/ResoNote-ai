  "lyrics": "I will run alone tonight\r\nWithout you by my side\r\nI guess you had a place you had to get to\r\nI know your eyes\r\nI know inside\r\nThe walls you hide behind\n\nAnd I saw the truth inside the real you\n\nBecause I know you're lost when you run away\n\nInto the same black holes and black mistakes\n\nTaking all my will just to run alone\n\nWhen are you coming home?\n\n\n\nEven if the sky does fall\n\nEven if they take it all\n\nThere's no pain that I won't go through\n\nEven if I have to die for you\n\n\n\nAnd when all the fires burn\n\nWhen everything is overturning\n\nThere's no thing that I won't go through\n\nEven if I have to die for you\n\n\n\nOne day the earth will open wide\n\nAnd I'll follow you inside\n\nCause the only hell I know is without you\n\nSome day when galaxies collide\n\nWe'll be lost on different skies\n\nI will send my rocket ship to find you\n\nBecause I know you're lost when you run away\n\nInto the same black holes and black mistakes\n\nTaking all my will just to run alone\n\nUntil I bring you home\n\n\n\nEven if the sky does fall\n\nEven if they take it all\n\nThere's no pain that I won't go through\n\nEven if I have to die for you\n\n\n\nAnd when all the fires burn\n\nWhen everything is overturning\n\nThere's no thing that I won't go through\n\nEven if I have to die for you\n\n\n\nAnd if the sun grows cold along the way\n\nAnd if the stars don't line to light the way\n\nAnd when you fall away and crash back down below\n\nI'll search the skies for you and I'll follow\n\nI'll be in your afterglow\n\nAnd I'll bring you home\n\n\n\nEven if the sky does fall\n\nEven if they take it all\n\nI can't see but I'll follow you\n\nEven if I'd die...\n\n\n\nAnd when all the fires burn\n\nWhen everything is overturning\n\nThere's no thing that I won't go through\n\nEven if I have to die for you"
