  "lyrics": "Baby, I know pain is as natural as the rain\r\nI just thought it didn't rain in California\r\nBaby, I know love isn't what I thought it was\r\n'Cause I've never known love like this before, oh, yeah\r\nBaby, I know dreams tend to crumble at extremes\n\nI just thought our dream would last a little bit longer\n\nThere's a time when every man draws a line down in the sand\n\nWe're surviving, we're still living, I'm stronger\n\n\n\nYou've been cheating on, cheating on me\n\nI've been cheating on, cheating on you\n\nYou've been cheating on me\n\nBut I've been cheating through this life\n\nAnd all its suffering\n\nOh Christ\n\nAm I good for nothing?\n\n\n\nBaby, I know hate is always waiting at the gate\n\nI just thought we'd lock the gate when we left in the morning\n\nWhen I was told that war is how we landed on these shores\n\nI just thought the drums of war beat louder warnings\n\n\n\nYou've been cheating on, cheating on me\n\nI've been cheating on, cheating on you\n\nYou've been cheating on me\n\nBut I've been cheating through this life\n\nAnd all its suffering\n\nOh Christ\n\nAm I good for nothing?\n\n\n\nBaby, I know death probably hasn't happened yet\n\n'Cause I don't remember living life before this\n\nAnd, darling, our disease is the same one as the trees\n\nUnaware that they've been living in a forest\n\n\n\nYou've been cheating on, cheating on me\n\nI've been cheating on, cheating on you\n\nYou've been cheating on me\n\nBut I've been cheating through this life\n\nAnd all its suffering\n\nOh Christ\n\nAm I good for nothing?\n\nThis life\n\nAnd all its suffering\n\nOh Christ\n\nAm I good for nothing?"
