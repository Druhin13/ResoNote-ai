  "title": "Since My Love Has Gone",
  "lyrics": "Oh I'm lonely and left with tears and sorrow\rI can't face tomorrow since my love has gone\rHe's left me left me for another and my heart went with him\rHow can I go on\rWas our love a game played for a day\rWere you pretending two hearts gone astray\rAm I to blame for this unhappy ending\rNothing else is left me but a memory\rBeloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you\rLive again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone\rSince my love has gone"
