  "lyrics": "Ye-e-ah, oh-oh!\r\nI see this scene where you walk down the hallway\r\nI try to stop you, but you don't wait\r\nIt's exactly what I was afraid of, you don't love me anymore\r\nAnd I know the part where you say you're unfaithful\n\nSittin' at the kitchen table\n\nIn that moment in-between I love and fuckin' hate you\n\nI'm not sure, not sure\n\n\n\nWhy that isn't stopping me\n\nSo come sweep me off my feet\n\n\n\n'Cause I wanna give, give you all that I got\n\nAnd I wanna believe we'll defy all the odds\n\nAnd I hope you don't hurt me\n\nBut oh, if you do\n\nIt would be worth getting hurt by you\n\n\n\nEverybody's got their own opinion\n\nAnd I hate, but admit it\n\nIt's naive to think that you and I are somehow different\n\nFrom anyone else\n\nAnd I give myself, but only giving fractions\n\nThis is not what I imagined\n\nGotta put myself out on the line and see what happens\n\nBefore I give up\n\n\n\nBut that isn't stopping me\n\nSo come sweep me off my feet\n\n\n\n'Cause I wanna give, give you all that I got\n\nAnd I wanna believe we'll defy all the odds\n\nAnd I hope you don't hurt me\n\nBut oh, if you do\n\nIt would be worth getting hurt by you\n\n\n\nOh, I could wonder\n\nWill our love survive?\n\nOh, but what a waste of time\n\nWhoa-oh\n\n\n\nI wanna give, give you all that I got\n\nAnd I wanna believe we'll defy all the odds\n\nAnd I hope you don't hurt me\n\nBut oh, if you do\n\nIt would be worth getting hurt by you\n\nGetting hurt by, by you-ou-ou\n\nGetting hurt by, by you-ou-ou\n\nBy you-ou-ou\n\nOh, it would be worth getting hurt by you"
