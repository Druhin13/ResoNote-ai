  "lyrics": "I went into town to see you\r\nyesterday\r\nbut you were not home.\r\nSo I talked to some old friends\r\nfor a while\r\nbefore I wandered off alone.\n\n\n\nIt's so hard for me now\n\nBut I'll make it somehow,\n\nThough I know I'll never be the same.\n\nWon't you ever change your ways,\n\nIt's so hard to make love pay\n\nWhen you're on the losing end,\n\nAnd I feel that way again.\n\n\n\nWell, I miss you more than ever,\n\nsince you've gone\n\nI can hardly maintain.\n\nThings are different round here\n\nevery night,\n\nmy tears fall down like rain.\n\n\n\nIt's so hard for me now\n\nBut I'll make it somehow,\n\nThough I know I'll never be the same.\n\nWon't you ever change your ways,\n\nIt's so hard to make love pay\n\nWhen you're on the losing end,\n\nAnd I feel that way again."
