  "lyrics": "When evil roars and the darkness rails\r\nWhen night's so long, when everything you tried has failed\r\nThere is still return, there is still something pure\r\nThere is still love, there is the sinner's cure\r\nWhen all the hope you thought you knew you had\n\nRuns out with the dreams of everything\n\nYou thought you'd be by now, you should be free by now\n\nYou're screaming out while the world spins 'round\n\nYou thought somebody woulda noticed by now\n\nBut when you've reached the end, there's the sinner's cure\n\n\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran\n\n\n\nWhy did God kill his Son?\n\nWas it something I said, or something I done?\n\nWhy there have to be death when He's supposed to be love? Oh\n\nWas it just me or was it bigger than we?\n\nHow you get what you need when you need glory\n\nThe King of Kings got no needs, already got victory\n\n\n\nYou ever felt lonely and see the night sky\n\nAnd think what am I? Why am I here? Why am I even here?\n\nIs there not one true thing? Is there not one thing true?\n\nWhile You were dying for me I was dying for you\n\nWhile You were dying for me I was dying for you\n\n\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\n(The sinner's cure)\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\n(To live for glory and it's all Yours)\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\n(All I need is the sinner's cure)\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\n(To live for glory and it's all Yours)\n\nThe sinner's cure\n\n(All I need is the sinner's cure)\n\nAnd the blood ran\n\nAnd the blood ran down\n\nAnd the blood ran"
