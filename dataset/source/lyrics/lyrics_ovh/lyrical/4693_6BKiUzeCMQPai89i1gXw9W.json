(I will not let you down) eh eh eh...\n\n\n\nFreedom\n\nFreedom\n\nFreedom (Freedom, freedom)\n\nGotta have some faith in the sound\n\n\n\nHave some freedom (Have some freedom, oh)\n\nFreedom\n\nFreedom (Freedom)\n\n\n\nAll we have to do now (All we can do)\n\nIs take these lies and make them true somehow\n\nAll we have to see\n\nIs that I don't belong to you\n\nAnd you don't belong to me (Freedom)\n\n\n\nI won't let you down\n\nI will not give you up\n\nGotta have some faith in the sound\n\nIt's the one good thing that I've got\n\nI won't let you down\n\nI will not give you up\n\nIt's the one good thing that I've got"
