  "lyrics": "Protecting Ryan\r\nProtecting Ryan\r\nBack when I was a teenager\r\nMe, my brother Vish, and My brother Greg was playing basketball at the court\r\nThere was these two niggas in general that just kept fouling, just fouling, fouling\r\nSo I went up for a lay-up, I'm like \"ball nigga!\"\n\nGod damn, they talkin' shit, I'm talkin' shit\n\nHe jumps up in my face\n\nSo I throw an overhand right and a hook\n\nBitch! 'wham! wham!'\n\nThis nigga falls to the ground asleep\n\nAll you see is Z's, birdies, stars, you hear all that shit\n\nAnd then I run up on the nigga that he was with that was also talkin' shit\n\nI said \"what's up\"\n\nSoon as I said that, this nigga Vish just threw the basketball and hit him in the face hard as fuck, 'boom!'\n\nNow if he was about to say something tough, he must have just changed his mind 'cause that nigga turned around and broke running\n\nAll I heard that nigga saying was, \"I don't want a problem\"\n\nAnd right when I was thinking to myself, 'where the fuck is Greg at?'\n\nI'm reminded of why I never call him when there's a problem\n\nHe got this thing about protectin' Ryan, he just kinda overdo shit\n\nSo the next thing that happened in my mind, went like this:\n\nGreg flew into the picture, possibly from out of the sky, I think he was wearing a cape\n\nHe landed infront of me like 'duhn duhn dah duhn'\n\nWith a knife in his hand, with the handle taped up that he had been keeping under his front driver's seat in his car the whole time and nobody knew\n\nThis nigga just blacked out and started swinging the knife at the dude I dropped\n\n'swoosh swoosh swoosh' \"I'mma kill you mother fucker!\"\n\nAnd start cuttin' the nigga\n\nI had to grab him like, \"Greggy, what are you doing? Don't kill this nigga!\"\n\nThe whole park just went silent\n\nAnd then the silence gets broken by police sirens\n\nAnd all you hear from each way is people going, \"Greg throw the knife on the roof! Greg throw the knife in the pool! Get rid of the knife, Greg!\"\n\nAnd he drops the bloody knife right in the grass\n\nI look at him, he looks back at me\n\nPrison bars just come in between us and surrounds him completely\n\nMy mother and father just outta nowhere pops into the picture\n\nAnd I said, \"You ain't have to try to kill him Greggy\"\n\nMy mother and father, \"Why you have to try and kill him Greggy?\"\n\nHe said, \"I was protecting Ryan!\"\n\nAnd then he went to prison and started writing letters home\n\n\"Dear Momma\n\nI'm so sorry\n\nAll I was doing was protectin' Ryan\"\n\nAnd then he came home\n\n\"Ryan got a record deal, did you hear, Greg?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I deal with a record everyday that I got for calling myself protecting Ryan.\"\n\n\"But you ain't have to call his wife a bitch right to her face\"\n\n\"See here we go again, don't nobody never see my side of the story. Everytime I turn around, y'all either defending or protecting Ryan\"\n\nI think I get it now\n\nThank you for protectin' me\n\nI wouldn't be where I'm at today if you hadn't protected me\n\nThank you\n\nThank you for teaching me how to rap\n\nThank you for teaching me how to scrap\n\nThank you for sacrificing your life so I can have a better life\n\nGreg, is that what you want to hear?"
