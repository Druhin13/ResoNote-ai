  "lyrics": "You ain't gotta tell me I been on your mind\r\nYou fell asleep in my t-shirt\r\nGripping my pillow tight\r\nYou didn't think I would be here tonight\r\nWent to bed listenin' to what we like\r\nMade the perfect little playlist\n\nLooks like somebody was makin' plans to welcome me home again\n\n\n\nBut I landed early and I couldn't wait up\n\nI been missin' you lately, I made my escape\n\nBut it seems like I'm already here in your dreams\n\nAnd I couldn't stand to mess up a good thing\n\n\n\n(It's been a mighty long time since I held you tight)\n\nBut I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me\n\n(Get ready for the sunrise, I'ma make it right)\n\nBut I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me\n\n\n\nLately I've been puttin' in overtime, life on the road can get lonely\n\nI was never good with time away and it gets a little harder everyday\n\nEverything is better when I'm by your side, I mean the world is amazin'\n\nAll I ever really want to do is make my way back to you\n\n\n\nBut I landed early and I couldn't wait up\n\nI been missin' you lately, I made my escape\n\nBut it seems like I'm already here in your dreams\n\nAnd I couldn't stand to mess up a good thing\n\n\n\n(It's been a mighty long time since I held you tight)\n\nBut I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me\n\n(Get ready for the sunrise, I'ma make it right)\n\nBut I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me\n\n\n\nYou've been calling my phone all day\n\nI'm sorry if I made you worry\n\nBut now that I'm standin' in your grace\n\nI'm reminded why I have to earn it\n\n\n\n(It's been a mighty long time since I held you tight)\n\nBut I can't wake you when your dreaming of me\n\n(Get ready for the sunrise, I'ma make it right)\n\nBut I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me"
