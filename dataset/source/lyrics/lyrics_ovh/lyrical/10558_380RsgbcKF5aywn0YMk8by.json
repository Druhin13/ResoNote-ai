  "lyrics": "Couple cover charge stamps got her hand looking like a rainbow\r\nIn and out of every bar on a whim just like the wind blows\r\nShe's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup\r\nTake a drunk girl home\r\nShe's bouncing like a pinball\n\nSinging every word she never knew\n\nDancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room\n\nHer hair's a perfect mess, falling out of that dress\n\nTake a drunk girl home\n\n\n\nTake a drunk girl home\n\nLet her sleep all alone\n\nLeave her keys on the counter, your number by the phone\n\nPick up her life she threw on the floor\n\nLeave the hall lights on, walk out and lock the door\n\nThat's how she knows the difference between a boy and a man\n\nTake a drunk girl home\n\n\n\nYou leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat\n\nThey're singing \"Closing Time\" at that little bar across the street\n\nIn two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up\n\nThat TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off\n\nAnd through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighborâ€™s cigarette cough\n\nThere's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did\n\n\n\nTake a drunk girl home\n\nLet her sleep all alone\n\nLeave her keys on the counter, your number by the phone\n\nPick up her life she threw on the floor\n\nLeave the hall lights on, walk out and lock the door\n\nThat's how ya know the difference between a boy and a man\n\nYou take a drunk girl home\n\n\n\nYou took a drunk girl home\n\nIn the sober light of dawn\n\nShe left you a message, she thanks you on the phone\n\n'Cause you picked up her life she threw on the floor\n\nYou left the hall lights on, walked out and locked the door\n\nThat's how she knows the difference between a boy and a man\n\nTake a drunk girl home\n\n\n\nYou take a drunk girl home\n\nTake a drunk girl home"
