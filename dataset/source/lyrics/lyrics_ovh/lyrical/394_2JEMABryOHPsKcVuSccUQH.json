  "lyrics": "She goes by the nickname peyote, \nHer real name is Iris\r\nAppearance doesn't matter so im not gonna describe it\r\nShe was a dancer down at edit this portion\r\nI cant name the spot they don't merit the promotion\r\nBut I been there look like any strip club\n\nEverybody slicked up trying to get they dick sucked\n\nSmoke and mirrors you know fake magic tricks\n\nLike these people didn't come here just for ass and tits\n\nBut this one in particular was popular with midlife ballers\n\nAnd white collar out of towners \n\nPlus it attracted athletic individuals that came here to play against\n\nThe twins and the timber wolves\n\nSafe to say she made the rent good\n\nTwenty years of age a spot up in Kentwood \n\nShe had the car, the dog, and the kitchen sink\n\nShe had a drug free body didn't even drink\n\nShe had a sister who wouldn't stop giving her shit\n\nFor dropping out of art school to be a stripper\n\nIris was sick and tired of the questions\n\nBut big sis didn't understand the perspective\n\nShe knows her little sister isn't a slut\n\nBut she objectifies herself and contributes to the gluttony \n\nNow here's Iris stealin' from the devil to buy some time \n\nTo make life something special\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nWhere did you go? When did you fall?\n\nThat little one, you all grown up\n\nOh how they've grown, those days are done\n\nUnder the gun, now you are dealt \n\nWhere did you go? When did you fall?\n\nThat little one, you all grown up\n\nOh how they've grown, those days are done\n\nLook at us, who you to judge?\n\n\n\nHer oldest sisters name was Jocelyn \n\nAwfully slim, on a diet of bottled water and oxygen\n\nShe lives on higher water by the Target\n\nAnd she dates a photographer, that's how she started modeling\n\nShe ain't no supermodel, this is Minneap for that you'd have to move to Chicago \n\nOr maybe LA or NY\n\nNow she does what she does here and she gets by\n\nAnd her boyfriend gets a little currency\n\nTaking photos for advertising agencies\n\nNow he's gonna steal from the devil\n\nStick it to the man, revolutionary rebel\n\nOne afternoon after work he went to the strip club\n\nJust to loosen up that shirt\n\nHe and a couple job associates are gonna sink them drinks\n\nLike they about to be extinct\n\nNever met his girlfriends little sister\n\nBut she recognized him from cell phone pictures\n\nAny other circumstances she'd have hollered\n\nBut topless in heels is a little bit awkward\n\nEventually his friends leave\n\nAnd when he gets up, she grabs him by the coat sleeve\n\nToo drunk to catch what she says\n\nBut he did offer her three hundred on some head, like\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nWhere did you go? When did you fall?\n\nThat little one, you all grown up\n\nOh how they've grown, those days are done\n\nUnder the gun, now you are dealt \n\nWhere did you go? When did you fall?\n\nThat little one, you all grown up\n\nOh how they've grown, those days are done\n\nLook at us, who you to judge?\n\n\n\nWhen you do wrong it makes me want to do right \n\nIt also cancels out the guilt that makes the load feel light\n\nIt also gives some leverage to the morally impaired \n\nSo make mistakes for us to hold over your hair"
