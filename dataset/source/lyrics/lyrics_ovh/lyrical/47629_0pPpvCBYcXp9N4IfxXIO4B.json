  "lyrics": "We're part of a culture that really loves to hate us\nEvery chance they get they attempt to isolate and debate us\nIt's not that they don't like us, its just they don't like\nGod in us\nIt's common knowledge and Oddly enough, it makes a lot of\nsense to a lot of us,\n\nWe completely understand because we use to occupy the same\n\nspace\n\nAnd lived in a similar type state until we tasted of God's\n\ngrace\n\nSo we continue loving this world that so easily rejects us\n\nAnd passionately press past the lack of their cultural\n\nacceptance\n\nAnd as if there weren't enough problems for us gaining\n\ninfluence\n\nWe keep fighting over the issue of what's too worldly of a\n\nchristian to make a difference\n\nSo no matter how you paint it or politically campaign it\n\nWhether you water it down and drain it. It's really all the\n\nsame ain't it?\n\nIt's the same frustration, same constant segregation\n\nChristians living like aliens trying to relate with citizens\n\nof a different nation\n\nWhat always makes for a better presentation then bark and\n\nbite\n\nIs a proper understanding of living life filled with salt\n\nand light\n\nSo we walk this fine line of walking in light of God's\n\nkindness\n\nAnd live with a sense of worldliness without the fear of\n\ncompromising\n\nLoving God and neighbor until Christ comes to split the sky\n\nOr die in this society hailing Jesus as Messiah\n\n\n\nHey, I thought we won the battle but it really looks like we\n\nlosing it\n\nWhat we do seems insignificant, so limited in our influence\n\nThey don't listen to our message, we scream and yell it,\n\nthey say it's irrelevant\n\nIt's the greatest story ever told but a television ain't\n\ntelling it\n\nSo often they just mock our faith and it makes me wanna hide\n\nmy face\n\nWhy we sitting on our hands with no plans like we got time\n\nto waste?\n\nThe culture could change if someone stepped up for the cause\n\nTo rep us and our God, but who will accept the job?\n\nIf only we had better rappers to gain us more respect\n\nTo validate what we believe and keep our name up in the\n\npress\n\nBut God does not use the same methods as the world\n\nHe chose the foolish and the weak to bring His message to\n\nthe world\n\nWe were rescued from the world, He left us here to be His\n\nservants\n\nWe don't need more superstars we need more Gospel centered\n\nchurches\n\nWorking as the body to bring the Gospel to the nations\n\nEven when we face rejection Jesus is our validation\n\nAnd we will be vindicated, yeah we know His path is narrow\n\nTo follow Him requires more than bumper stickers and apparel\n\nThey will know us by our love, not by our celebrities\n\nSo we pray for those who persecute us and show love to our\n\nenemies\n\n\n\nWe are in this world not of it, not to be scared and run\n\nfrom it\n\nWe shine light in the darkness, that's why He left us here\n\nCalling out to all the exiles, the Lord will not forsake you\n\nHis kingdom can't be shaken, hold strong the end is near\n\nWe are the light of the world, so, shine on"
