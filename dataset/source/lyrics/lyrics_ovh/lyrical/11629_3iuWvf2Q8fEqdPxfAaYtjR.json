  "lyrics": "Ol’ 67 Fleetwood sittin’ out in the barn\r\nTransmission shot, but we kept the battery charged\r\nYou used to come over and that’s where we’d go\r\nClimb in and play that big four speaker stereo\r\nSinking deep in the seats of that ol’ Cadillac\n\nUnder the spell of that ol’ eight track\n\nYou took me to Heaven in nothin’ flat\n\nWith Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack\n\n\n\nSittin’ up on blocks in our own little world\n\nWe’d sit there together just you and me girl\n\nWe’d fog up the windows ‘til we couldn’t see out\n\nFinding everything we couldn’t live without\n\n\n\nSinking deep in the seats of that ol’ Cadillac\n\nUnder the spell of that ol’ eight track\n\nYou took me to Heaven in nothin’ flat\n\nWith Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack\n\n\n\nSometimes I come out here on a night like tonight\n\nAnd I picture you smiling in the dashboard lights\n\nIt feels like I’m flying but I’m sitting still\n\nI close my eyes and put my hands on the wheel\n\n\n\nSinking deep in the seats of that ol’ Cadillac\n\nUnder the spell of that ol’ eight track\n\nYou took me to Heaven in nothin’ flat\n\nWith Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack\n\n\n\nWe went to Heaven\n\nWe went to Texas\n\nWe did some livin’ and that’s a fact\n\nWith Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack\n\nWith Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack\n\nWith Waylon and Willie and a bottle of Jack"
