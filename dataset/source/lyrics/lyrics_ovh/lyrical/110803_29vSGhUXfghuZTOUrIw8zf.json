We're built to judge niggas like off the rip, but I've definitely gotten more into a space of, of trying to be understanding first, you know what I'm saying? I know that if a lot of, if some of my shit, nigga, hit the web or TMZ with only half the story, the shit'll look crazy, you feel me? So, you know, it's just realizing that like, you're only ever getting pieces of, of the information, know what I'm saying? Pieces of the story, you're only ever getting pieces of the person and you judge a whole life off a moment, you feel me? And that shit just really kinda humbles you..."
