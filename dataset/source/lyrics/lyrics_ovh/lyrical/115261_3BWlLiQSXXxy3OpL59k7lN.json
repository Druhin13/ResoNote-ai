  "lyrics": "I saw you smile\nI knew you had spirit\nOh won't you let your colors run?\nAnd isn't it odd the way we try to tell ourselves we got limits?\nYou're beautiful but you just don't see it sometimes\nAnd I don't know why\n\n\n\nOh you're the shape of my days\n\nOh you're my holy place\n\nAnd I know\n\n\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen you're alone with me\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen we're alone\n\nWhen I fall, I'm fine\n\nAll I wanted was your time\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen you're alone, alone with me\n\n\n\nI'll sit right here till you start talking\n\nI'll wait it out till you come 'round\n\nIt pays to look up in the big city everything moves so fast\n\nIt pays to look up 'cause you don't know what you might see\n\nWhen you look around\n\n\n\nOh you're the shape of my days\n\nOh you're my holy place\n\nAnd I know\n\n\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen you're alone with me\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen we're alone\n\n\n\nHere I am, saying things to you\n\nI never thought that I would say outside my head\n\nOh and here we are\n\nI'm doing things with you I never thought we'd do\n\nI'm seeing into you\n\n\n\nOh you're the shape of my days\n\nOh you're my holy place\n\nAnd I know\n\n\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen you're alone with me\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen we're alone\n\nWhen I fall, I'm fine\n\nAll I wanted was your time\n\nEverything's good\n\nEverything's just as it should be\n\nWhen you're alone, alone with me\n\nYou're alone with me, babe\n\nYou're alone with me\n\nYou're alone with me, babe\n\nYou're alone with me\n\nYou're alone with me, babe\n\nYou're alone with me\n\nYou're alone with me, babe"
