  "lyrics": "I wouldn’t say I would’ve chosen it\r\nThat time I hit the bottom and it hurt a little bit\r\nFunny how being down can make you look up\r\nBut now I’m better for it\r\nAll I could see in the moment was\n\nMy heart and how it felt ripped open, I’ll admit\n\nI found you down low in the brokenness\n\nAnd now I’m better for it\n\n\n\nI count it all as joy even when I’m in the flame\n\n'Cause I know you always\n\n\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme grace when I need it\n\nHindsight 20/20, now I see that\n\nYou let me be where I’ve been\n\nSo I can be all that I am\n\nYou gimme, gimme, gimme faith to believe that\n\nWhen it hurts there’s a real good reason\n\nYou let me be where I’ve been\n\nSo I can be all that I am\n\nBetter for it\n\n\n\nYeah, I used to think pain was a consequence\n\nBut now I kinda think it might be the perfect gift\n\nYou use to get me straight to you\n\nAnd I’m better for it\n\n\n\nI count it all as joy even when I’m in the flame\n\n'Cause I know you always\n\n\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme grace when I need it\n\nHindsight 20/20, now I see that\n\nYou let me be where I’ve been\n\nSo I can be all that I am\n\nYou gimme, gimme, gimme faith to believe that\n\nWhen it hurts, there’s a real good reason\n\nYou let me be where I’ve been\n\nSo I can be all that I am\n\nBetter for it\n\n\n\nDown low, down in the broken\n\nI found you and I’m better for it\n\nDown low, down in the broken\n\nI found you and I’m better for it\n\n\n\nI’m better 'cause I’ll never have to be the way I would be\n\nWithout you, without you\n\nLeading me where you want me\n\nI’m better 'cause I’ll never have to be the way I would be\n\nWithout you, without you\n\nLeading me where you want me\n\n\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme grace when I need it\n\nHindsight 20/20, now I see that\n\nYou let me be where I’ve been\n\nSo I can be all that I am\n\nYou gimme, gimme, gimme faith to believe that\n\nWhen it hurts, there’s a real good reason\n\nYou let me be where I’ve been\n\nSo I can be all that I am\n\nBetter for it\n\n\n\nDown low, down in the broken\n\nI found you and I’m better for it\n\nDown low, down in the broken\n\nI found you and I’m better for it\n\nDown low, down in the broken\n\nI found you and I’m better for it\n\nDown low, down in the broken\n\nI found you and I’m better for it"
