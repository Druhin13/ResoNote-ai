  "lyrics": "When I woke up this morning, things were lookin' bad\r\nSeem like total silence was the only friend I had\r\nBowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won\r\nAnd it was twelve o'clock before I realized\r\nThat I was havin' ... no fun\n\nChorus:\n\nBut fortunately I have the key to escape reality\n\nAnd you may see me tonight with an illegal smile\n\nIt don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while\n\nWon't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone\n\nNo I'm just tryin' to have me some fun\n\n\n\nLast time I checked my bankroll,\n\nIt was gettin' thin\n\nSometimes it seems like the bottom\n\nIs the only place I've been\n\nI Chased a rainbow down a one-way street... dead end\n\nAnd all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nWell, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls\n\nTryin' to get away\n\nFrom all the ears inside my walls\n\nI dreamed the police heard\n\nEverything I thought... what then?\n\nWell I went to court\n\nAnd the judge's name was Hoffman\n\n\n\nAh but fortunately I have the key to escape reality\n\nAnd you may see me tonight with an illegal smile\n\nIt don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while\n\nWon't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone\n\nNo I'm just tryin' to have me some fun\n\nWell done, hot dog bun, my sister's a nun"
