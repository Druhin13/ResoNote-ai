  "lyrics": "Jesus is the bread of life, without him, you're toast\r\nHallelujah y’all I found the Holy Ghost\r\nTo be almost saved only means that you're lost\r\nSins are expenses and Jesus paid the cost\r\nThese church towns they light up\n\nThese roads that I roam\n\nThey're leadin’ me closer to callin' me home\n\nThe further I get, the further I go\n\nThis interstate gospel is savin' my soul\n\nThis interstate gospel is savin' my soul"
