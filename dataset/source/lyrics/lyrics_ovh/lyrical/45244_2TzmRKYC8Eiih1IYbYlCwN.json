  "lyrics": "Now I raise my head up slowly\r\nFrom the East down to the West\r\nSomehow past mistakes that plague you now are gone\r\nAnd I close my eyes so tightly\r\nBeneath the weight of old regrets\r\nAnd I hide behind the words I write\n\nAnd bow my head again\n\n\n\nBut I owe myself a little more this time\n\nOh I've raised my head, but I held it up just a little too high\n\nAnd in the night who will be with you if your fears are realised\n\nThere's a light that shines on whats to come, burning deep inside\n\n\n\nSo I'll meet you in the morning\n\nBeneath the pale blue of the sky\n\nAnd the choices that we make will linger on\n\nAnd I would not say dont worry\n\nFor not every fear is blind\n\nOh the lines I've made across my face are echos of my life\n\n\n\nAnd I know myself a little more this time\n\nOh I've walked these roads before and fell a little behind\n\nAnd in the night who will be with you if your fears are realised\n\nOh the light that shines on whats to come, burning deep inside\n\n\n\nNow I don't know where I'm going\n\nBut I know where I have been\n\nAnd the light that shines on whats to come is burning deep within\n\nI said the light that shines on what to come burning deep within\n\nI know the light that shines on what to come is burning deep within"
