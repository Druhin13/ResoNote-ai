  "lyrics": "With every touch, I'm getting closer to the edge\r\nWith these open wounds, I forgive you\r\nWith every horror, I lose myself along the bend\r\nIn the fog, we become disconnected\r\nAsh to bone, you come to me\r\nYou're never alone, but soon we'll be\n\nStrangers in the gray\n\nStrangers in our own ways\n\n\n\nWith every touch, I'm getting closer to the edge\n\nWith these open wounds, I forgive you\n\nWith every horror, I lose myself along the bend\n\nIn the fog, we become disconnected\n\nAsh to bone, you come to me\n\nYou're never alone, but soon we'll be\n\nStrangers in the gray\n\nStrangers in our own ways"
