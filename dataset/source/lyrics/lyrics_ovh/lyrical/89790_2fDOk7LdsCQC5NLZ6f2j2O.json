  "lyrics": "Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll never play\r\nMaybe I'll lose, maybe I'll lead the game\r\nSomething calling, don't know where I'm going\r\nI feel it in my veins\r\nHad some tough breaks in this town, heaven knows\r\nSeen some heart aches, weighed me down like a stone\n\nWell, I licked my wounds, I got nothing to lose\n\nI'm headed out on my own\n\n\n\nI'll never go back\n\nI'll never go back\n\nYou'll never change that\n\nI'll never go back\n\n\n\nWill I make it? Will I taste victory?\n\nWill I give in or will I risk it on me?\n\nAll this reminiscing and wishing things were different\n\nHas brought me down to my knees\n\nKiss my mother, tell her I'll be okay\n\nCouldn't stay here, had to find my own way\n\nWell, there's something better, there's got to be better\n\nI know I'm gonna find it some day\n\n\n\nI'll never go back\n\nI'll never go back\n\nYou'll never change that\n\nI'll never go back\n\n\n\nOoh, I can't expect to find a feeling like that again\n\nNo, I won't pretend\n\nOh, I know there's something waiting down this road ahead\n\nI'll find it in the end\n\nFind it in the end\n\n\n\nGo back, go back\n\nGo back, go back\n\nGo back, go back\n\nGo back, go back (Oh no, I won't go, no, I won't, I won't)\n\nGo back, go back\n\nI'll never, never, never go back\n\nI'll never, never, never go back\n\nI'll never, never, never go back\n\nI'll never, never, never go back"
