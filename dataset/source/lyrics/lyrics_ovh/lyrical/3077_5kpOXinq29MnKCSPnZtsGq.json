  "lyrics": "People wonder, people talk\r\nWe're supposed to settle down\r\nHow we ever got this far\r\nWithout our feet touching the ground\r\nWhat time is it now where you are?\r\nWe follow beats with different drums\n\nWe're looking at the same stars\n\nIt is a talent staying young\n\n\n\nSo why you think we both\n\nRun around in circles\n\nWalk through fire\n\nNothing hurts us\n\n\n\nEvery mountain you climb takes you further away\n\nOvercome a lifetime, every day\n\nNo, we can't help it\n\nWe're always restless\n\nNow you're wired and you're tired\n\nThere is never a break\n\nYou only come alive at the thrill of the chase\n\nNo, we can't help it\n\nWe're always restless\n\n\n\nTry to keep it all up in the air\n\nYou ruin it when you ask why\n\nYou know it's not that I don't care\n\nI don't get jealous, I get free\n\nEverything good comes back to me\n\nIt seems like wherever you are\n\nIs just a better place to be\n\n\n\nSo why you think we both\n\nRun around in circles\n\nWill you meet me\n\nIn the middle?\n\n\n\nEvery mountain you climb takes you further away\n\nOvercome a lifetime, every day\n\nNo, we can't help it\n\nWe're always restless\n\nNow you're wired and you're tired\n\nThere is never a break\n\nYou only come alive at the thrill of the chase\n\nNo, we can't help it\n\nWe're always restless\n\n\n\nWe already know the ending\n\nWhen the credits roll down slow\n\nI'll hurry back\n\nI'll hurry back\n\nI'll hurry back\n\nTo you\n\n\n\nEvery mountain you climb takes you further away\n\nOvercome a lifetime, every day\n\nNo, we can't help it\n\nWe're always restless\n\nNow you're wired and you're tired\n\nThere is never a break\n\nYou only come alive at the thrill of the chase\n\nNo, we can't help it\n\nWe're always restless\n\n\n\nI'll hurry back\n\nI'll hurry back\n\nI'll hurry back\n\n(Restless, restless, I feel restless)\n\nI'll hurry back (restless)\n\nI'll hurry (restless) back\n\n(I feel) I'll hurry (restless) back\n\nI feel restless\n\nRestless, restless"
