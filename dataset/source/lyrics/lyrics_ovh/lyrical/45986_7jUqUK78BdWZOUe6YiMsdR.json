  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Backseat Lovin' par Sonny Alven\r\nSo give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'\n\nWe look so small from the hill\nIt's so surreal how you make me feel\nPut my head down on your chest\nYou look at me while I undress\n\nYou turning me on\nLike a favorite song\nAll night long\nGonna be feeling like home\nFeeling like home\n\nSo give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'\n'Cause I really like the way you're holding, holding me\n\nSo don't let go now, don't let go now\nJust give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'\n\nWe don't have time to hesitate\nWhen I make you stay, no more mistakes\nLooking at the skyline silhouette\nSippin' on my wine\nYou smoke your cigarettes\n\nYou turning me on\nLike a favorite song\nAll night long\nGonna be feeling like home\nFeeling like home\n\nSo give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'\n'Cause I really like the way you're holding, holding me\n\nSo don't let go now, don't let go now\nJust give me all your backseat lovin', lovin'"
