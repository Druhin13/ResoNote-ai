  "lyrics": "Things got rough\r\nthings got tough\r\nthings got harder than hard\r\nWe were just trying to make a livin'\r\nin our back yard\n\nWe were born too late died to soon\n\nanxiety's a terrible crime\n\nif you don't come now don't come at all\n\n'cause it's a crooked piece of time.\n\n\n\nIt's a crooked piece of time that we live in\n\na crooked piece of time\n\nall in all and all in all\n\nIt's a crooked piece of time.\n\n\n\nYesterday morning an ill wind came\n\nblew your picture\n\nright out of the picture frame\n\neven blew the candle out\n\nfrom underneath the flame\n\nYesterday morning an ill wind came."
