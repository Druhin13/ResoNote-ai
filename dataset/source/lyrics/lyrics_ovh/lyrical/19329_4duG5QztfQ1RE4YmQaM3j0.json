  "lyrics": "So afraid, something feels so wrong\r\nA distant funeral song echoes in the wind\r\nWhat have you done\r\nAs you pray to your silent king\r\nThis night of reckoning\r\nWill forever change the course of what's to come\n\nOf what's to come\n\n\n\nFaith can be blind\n\nBut it cannot justify\n\nThe tragedy of a love's demise\n\nWe can't replace\n\n\n\nNo final rite\n\nThere will be no last goodbye\n\nLike a whisper in the night\n\nYou slipped away\n\n\n\nOh, blind faith\n\n\n\nWhat a shame, do you have a clue\n\nAll I ask of you is you understand\n\nMy anger once you're gone\n\nOnce you're gone\n\n\n\nCause faith can be blind\n\nBut it cannot justify\n\nThe tragedy of a love's demise\n\nWe can't replace\n\n\n\nNo final rite\n\nThere will be no last goodbye\n\nLike a whisper in the night\n\nYou slipped away\n\n\n\nI know you're steadfast in your ways\n\nNever compromise your faith\n\nBut is it worth it in the end\n\nTo never see my face again\n\n\n\nFaith can be blind\n\nBut it cannot justify\n\nThe tragedy of a love's demise\n\nWe can't replace\n\n\n\nNo final rite\n\nThere will be no last goodbye\n\nLike a whisper in the night\n\nYou slipped away\n\n\n\nOh, blind faith\n\nBlind faith"
