  "lyrics": "Don't waste your life behind that guitar\r\nYou may get gone, but you won't get far\r\nYou're not the first, you won't be the last\r\nAnd you can tell us all about it when you come crawling back\r\nThat road you're on, just winds and winds\r\nYour spinning your wheels and wasting you're time\n\n\n\nBut when the lights come up\n\nAnd I hear the band\n\nAnd where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am\n\nI hear the crowd\n\nI look around\n\nAnd I can't find an empty chair\n\nNot bad for a girl goin' nowhere\n\n\n\nI get these calls, out on the road\n\nHeard your song on my radio\n\nWe always said you'd make it big\n\nAnd I tell all my friends, I knew you back when\n\nSo don't forget all us little folks\n\nAnd when you crash and burn\n\nRemember we told you so\n\n\n\nAnd then the lights come up\n\nAnd I hear the band\n\nAnd where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am\n\nI hear the crowd\n\nI look around\n\nAnd I can't find one empty chair\n\nNot bad for a girl goin' nowhere\n\n\n\nI need to thank my daddy\n\nFor that first set of strings\n\nAnd all those folks who swore I'd never be anything\n\nIt took a whole lot of yes I wills and I don't care\n\nA whole lot of basement dives and county fairs\n\nTo this show right now and y'all sure look good out there\n\nNot bad for a girl goin' nowhere\n\nNot bad for a girl goin' nowhere"
