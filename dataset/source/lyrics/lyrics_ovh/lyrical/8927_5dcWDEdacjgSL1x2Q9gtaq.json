  "lyrics": "There's so many things we left undone, so much we didn't do\r\nStill got that shit you let me borrow that I never returned to you\r\nSo many things I should've done but I always got off track\r\nHere's the money that I owe you that you never asked for back\r\nCause you never asked for anything, not anything at all\r\nExcept once in a while you'd asked if I could give you a call\n\nOh I wish that I had listened then, how I wish I gave a damn\n\nHow I wish that I could call you now just to tell you how I am\n\n\n\nIf only I had found the time\n\nIf only I had even tried\n\nIf only I had done enough\n\nHaving to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much\n\n\n\nSince the day you left us things just haven't been the same\n\nMy family hasn't spoken since the day you went away\n\nIf only you could see us now I know you'd be ashamed\n\nCan you send me a sign from heaven and help us change our ways\n\n\n\nIf only I had found the time\n\nIf only I had even tried\n\nIf only I had done enough\n\nHaving to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much\n\n\n\nI can hear your voice in everything and every single song\n\nAnd it's tough holding my head up high still knowing that you're gone\n\nThese times are so confusing but I know that in the end\n\nWe will spread our wings and fly away the day we meet again\n\nDon't leave, I need you now\n\n\n\nIf only I had found the time\n\nIf only I had even tried\n\nIf only I had done enough\n\nHaving to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much\n\n\n\n(I need you now)\n\n\n\nIf only I had found the time\n\nIf only I had even tried\n\nIf only I had done enough\n\nHaving to let you go wouldn't have to hurt so much"
