  "lyrics": "Walk into the venue, you slipped me your CD\r\nAsk me if I'd listen, give you my critique\r\nI listened to it, but halfway through it\r\nI had to quit, your band sounds like shit\r\nSo, here we go\n\nDon't get mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\nI should have lied\n\nDon't get mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\n\n\nWalk into the bedroom, you were standing there\n\nTurned around and smiled at me and said, \"You just cut your hair\"\n\nBut then I told you I thought you looked better before\n\nYou said, \"Hope you like sleeping on the floor\"\n\n\n\nSo, here we go\n\nDon't get mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\nI should have lied\n\nNow you're mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\nHow 'bout from now on you'll write the script, I'll read the lines\n\nSo, here we go\n\nDon't get mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm staring at her napkin\n\nWith seven digits that I can't make out\n\nShe wrote it down in purple lipstick\n\nI should have never, I should have never opened up\n\nAnd baby, it's because I'm Irish\n\nI just couldn't keep my big mouth shut\n\nIs it an eight, is it a zero?\n\nI should have never, I should have never opened up\n\n\n\nSo, here we go\n\nDon't get mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\nI should have lied\n\nNow you're mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\nHow 'bout from now on you'll write the script, I'll read the lines\n\nSo, here we go\n\nDon't get mad at me, I'm just being honest\n\n(I'm just being honest)\n\nWhoa-oh-oh\n\n(I'm just being honest)\n\nWhoa-oh-oh\n\n(I'm just being honest)"
