  "lyrics": "Strange the ones you love\r\nCould bury your body underground\r\nI woke up too late again\r\nWould you start the coffee my only friend\r\nI forgot to fake\n\nThe way that I was feeling\n\nI guess it's too late\n\nNow all my cards are showing\n\n\n\nBrew\n\n\n\nNo you can't come up\n\nWho am I kidding I would drag you up\n\nWhat was that you said\n\nThat I don't exist inside your head\n\n\n\nYou said you would communicate better\n\nSo what will you send me a tea soaked letter\n\n\n\nMmmmmm\n\n\n\nI feel so alone\n\nWhen everyone in town is overblown\n\nSo I made a scene\n\nI can think of things more embarassing\n\n\n\nI forgot to fake\n\nThe way that I was feeling\n\nI guess it's too late\n\nNow all my cards are showing\n\n\n\nYou said you would communicate better\n\nSo what will you send me a tea soaked letter\n\n\n\nYou're all I wanted\n\nYou're all I wanted\n\nYou're all I wanted\n\nYou're all I wanted"
