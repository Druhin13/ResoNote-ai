  "lyrics": "You still hear every word that they say\r\nBut these days they ain't making no sound\r\nYou still had me thinking I'm crazy\r\nWish I knew then what I know now\r\nYou don't know what I been through\n\nSo who are you to judge me? (judge me)\n\nStill don't know if I believe there's anything above me (let's go)\n\nI've been numb for so long, wanna feel something\n\nLook in the mirror, I don't like who I'm becoming\n\nI don't know my place, I done lost my way\n\nThink that I won't break\n\nI don't know my place, I done lost my way\n\nThink that I won't break\n\n\n\nYou still hear every word that they say\n\nBut these days they ain't making no sound\n\nYou still had me thinking that I'm crazy\n\nWish I knew then what I know now (wish I knew)\n\nNobody really knows how I keep it all inside\n\nYou still have me thinking I'm crazy\n\nThis feeling's getting old now\n\nWish I knew then what I know now\n\n\n\nUh, know how to circle out\n\nKnow how to move when they doubt\n\nKnow what to choose when I'm movin' around\n\nSay you through with them clowns\n\nBut you still fuckin' 'round with them\n\nEvery now and then, in my DM, see the different cars I be in\n\nMost of the time I just be with them once, and don't call 'em again\n\nBut for you I play it safe, don't know why\n\nI ain't used to usin' brakes, once I close the door you can't escape\n\nPuttin' KK in a plane, different strains\n\nGot her feeling different things, niggas talk, still ain't the gang\n\nI like bigger planes, glasses of gin, bottles of champagne\n\nDiamond chains, bitches knowin' my name, is you leavin' or stayin'?\n\n\n\nYou still hear every word that they say\n\nBut these days they ain't making no sound (uh)\n\nYou still have me thinking I'm crazy (yeah)\n\nWish I knew then what I know now\n\nNobody really knows how I keep it all inside\n\nYou still have me thinking I'm crazy\n\nThis feeling's getting old now\n\nWish I knew then what I know now\n\n\n\nNobody really knows how I keep it all inside\n\nThis feeling's getting old now\n\nWish I knew then what I know now"
