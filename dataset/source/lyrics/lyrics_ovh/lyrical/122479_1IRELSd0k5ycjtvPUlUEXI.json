  "lyrics": "What you been keeping to yourself\r\nYou always throw that shoe back on us\r\nWhat you think you've been missing out\r\nYou always thought you had it figure out\r\nIt's just a flower and a shade there\n\nYou didn't see me when the rain came\n\n\n\nWon't you go hide it, you got something to feel\n\nWon't you go hide it, you got something to feel\n\nNo telling me what's left for you (what's left for you)\n\nJust stay here, I'll tell you all of the things I'd do\n\nAll of the things I'd do\n\n\n\nDon't act like you ain't never know\n\nAnd that you want to take it to show\n\nOh if you build in, thing will come\n\nBut where were you when I'll just have my fun\n\n\n\nI catch you hidden in the sunlight\n\nI only needed you to think twice\n\n\n\nWon't you go hide it, you got something to feel\n\nWon't you go hide it, you got something to feel\n\nNo telling me what's left for you (what's left for you)\n\nJust stay here, I'll tell you all of the things I'd do\n\n\n\nI got enough things, I'll make things right\n\nI got enough smoke to last all night\n\nI got enought things to get myself together\n\nAlthough I know things, the thing ain't you\n\nYou gotta show me just what to do\n\nThe feeling in that move, baby you must be heaven"
