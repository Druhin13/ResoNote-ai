  "lyrics": "Never thought I'd be so far from Georgia\r\nGeorgia's where I knew I'd always live and die\r\nNow here I am travelin' through Colorado\r\nLivin' on the road, just tryin' to survive\r\nAnd its been so long since I've felt at home\n\nI've forgotten what it feels like to be alone\n\nAnywhere\n\nMy woman's scared\n\nI might forget who I am too\n\nIf I don't come home soon\n\n\n\nLast night I drank until I passed out\n\nIn the middle of a crowd of folks I didn't know\n\nI heard 'em laughin' at me lyin' there\n\nFace-down in the dirt, huggin' a telephone pole\n\n\n\nNow it's a shame to be\n\nSelf-proclaimed free\n\nWhile trapped by the blindin' symptoms of addiction\n\nAt twenty nine\n\nAm I alive?\n\nIf I am, I am just barely holdin' on to life\n\n\n\nMusic used to be my way to escape\n\nGood to bad and everything between\n\nNow it's become what defines my name\n\nOh I wonder who it was I used to be\n\nAnd if I still\n\nHave the will\n\nTo finish what I started, right or wrong\n\n\n\nGod, it's been so long since I've felt at home\n\nI've forgotten what it feels like to be alone\n\nAnywhere\n\nAnd I'm scared\n\nI might forget who I am too\n\nIf I don't come home soon"
