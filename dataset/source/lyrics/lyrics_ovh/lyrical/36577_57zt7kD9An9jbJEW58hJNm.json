  "title": "What Does It Mean to Travel",
  "lyrics": "From departure to arrival\r\nWhat does it mean to travel\r\nWith your suitcase by the handle\r\nHolding everything you need\r\nAre you going or are you coming\r\nWalking slow or running\n\nToward somebody or from something\n\nTrade your longing in for speed\n\nAnd the freedom to be a stranger\n\nIs a bargain that's ours alone\n\nSometimes you just want to be someone else\n\nUnencumbered and unknown\n\nFrom departure to arrival\n\nWhat does it mean to travel\n\nAnd from taking off to landing\n\nYou could feel your heart expanding\n\nYou walked halfway down Manhattan\n\nTill you met the Brooklyn Bridge\n\nAnd in a 2 AM transmission\n\nFrom a high wire act position\n\nHow the skyline behind you glistened\n\nAs if someone pulled a switch\n\nAnd I don't want to be a stranger\n\nAnd I don't want to be alone\n\nBut sometimes I just want to be somewhere else\n\nUntethered and unknown\n\nWhen I am far from home\n\nFrom departure to arrival\n\nWhat does it mean to travel"
