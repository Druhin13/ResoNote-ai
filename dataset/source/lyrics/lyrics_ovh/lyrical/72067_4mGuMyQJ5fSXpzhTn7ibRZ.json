  "lyrics": "I could lose my heart tonight\r\nIf you don't turn and walk away\r\n'Cause the way I feel I might\r\nLose control and let you stay\r\n'Cause I could take you in my arms \nAnd never let go\n\n\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\n\n\nI could only wonder how\n\nTouching you would make me feel\n\nBut if I take that chance right now\n\nTomorrow will you want me still?\n\nSo I should keep this to myself\n\nAnd never let you know\n\n\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\n\n\nAnd I know it's not right\n\nAnd I guess I should try to do what I should do\n\nBut I could fall in love\n\nFall in love with you\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\n\n\nSiempre estoy soá±ada en ti\n\nBesandos mis labios, acariciando mi piel\n\nAbrazadome con ansias locas\n\nImaginando que me amos\n\nCómo yo podia amar a ti\n\n\n\nSo I should keep this to myself\n\nAnd never let you know\n\n\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\nI could fall in love with you\n\nI could fall in love\n\nI could fall in love\n\nWith you..."
