O.D.B\n\nComin' through like Killa Bee\n\nEver since I heard Enter the 36 in '93\n\nYou cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered\n\nFuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered\n\nNot even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender\n\nMy agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)\n\nYeah, we live and thorough\n\nAssassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough\n\nFrom Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem, all the way to Maryland\n\nYeah, we comin' for all 'em\n\nBobby Tarantino to the Digital\n\nMy shit is pivotal\n\nSmokin' chronic, no medicinal\n\nWho you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?\n\nThe one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone\n\n\n\nAye yo, Logic, what up? We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style\n\nYo, yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!\n\nGuess who stepped in the room\n\nIt's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more K\n\nIntelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes\n\nGuillotine your head, last scene in the showcase\n\nPush weight, this Colgate\n\nTre-eights and old gates\n\nExfoliate those we most hate\n\nWe don't associate\n\nWe wear robes that you can't even pronounce-iate\n\nWe eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate\n\nCribs where the floor just rises up and rotates\n\nLocations low-key, can't even locate\n\nTwin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates\n\nTea makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates\n\n\n\nYo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades\n\nIt gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge\n\n57 MB, yo, metallic green\n\nSeats is piped off\n\nSeize them old tracks, unite through 'em\n\nThe kitchen is my palace, get your dance on\n\nWhile we just levitate with trees, get your branch on\n\nI'm known to wil' out, put the cams on\n\nJewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on\n\nA specialist when I'm bakin'\n\nRhymes be comin' out, we makin'\n\nWe challengin' these chumps for lumps\n\nHere's the statement stop hatin'\n\nThe crew is all about gettin' this cake in\n\nYou know about me, you relatin'\n\n\n\nThe enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA\n\nBoth lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures\n\nMixtures of hipsters, weed smokers and beer drinkers\n\nPrince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers\n\nCake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin\n\nAcademically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'\n\nI felt it comin' like the Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'\n\nSporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin\n\nIII-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten\n\nThe travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted, diluted, broken down to a catastrophe\n\nBut cats still get good trophy\n\nHit y'all with their \"Okie-dokie\"\n\nBurt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit\n\nWhere the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one\n\nI got a light-beam gun\n\nI'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from\n\nBut you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery\n\nMy verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity\n\nYou can never get rid of me, step back and consider me\n\nWu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry\n\n\n\nOld-school on this track, I feel invincible\n\nThis new school ain't really got rules and lacks the principles\n\nGot mo' clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical\n\nThe gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle\n\nGo back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical\n\nWhen nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminal\n\nThe stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals\n\nY'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable We're the unpredictable, torture over your physical\n\nDrop a bar, used to pour water over the cereal\n\nAnother bar, reppin' my squad, not individual\n\nBut one Nation under God, that's indivisible\n\nMy time critical, hands-off from digital\n\nMe and my lady bark, back when the Planets was Digable\n\nI'm cool like that, my cash rule like that\n\nI'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on\n\n\n\nIt's only Logic, we got 'em mobber than the mosh pit\n\nFifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics\n\nThe hot shit I drop quick\n\nMajor player, watch my stock lift\n\nRazor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what\n\nSound boy, turn that music up\n\nNaysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up\n\nDeadly melody, the sickness, the remedy\n\nEverything circulate back around eventually\n\nWitty, unpredictable, talent all-natural\n\nGain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins\n\nTwenty-five years, still more of the same\n\nThe flow like water with the boilin' flame\n\nINS, your highness, they callin' my name\n\nBoy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain\n\nIn our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same\n\nTell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain\n\n\n\nSurvival of the fittest in cold days with no money\n\nThey don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me\n\nYou know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty\n\nSo I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language\n\nDear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it\n\nAn airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it\n\nBut money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it\n\nI'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it\n\nDo it for the Cs, they understood the game with it\n\nWe gave birth when we understood the pain with it\n\nWhen we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger\n\nWe killin' each other, but we all got the same anger\n\nNever go against the grain, homie, that's hateful\n\nAnother day in the life for us to be grateful\n\nSpread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful\n\nIt's better to stay full, so let's make moves\n\nI know your momma told you that I was a great dude\n\nThese dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you\n\nOn some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you\n\nWhat? What? They might Crystal in the Lake you\n\n\n\nBoom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off\n\nOur Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off\n\nSmoke and roast ya, the No.9 Potion\n\nPull that shit, son, we open the ocean\n\nWho gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'\n\nYou get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'\n\nThat's another level of emotion\n\nFood stamps niggas doin' grocery\n\nPolice wanna grope me perp walk, then nigga street-talk\n\nWe bury niggas in see-saw\n\nI carry the torch where I leave off\n\nI'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on\n\nI rip off a shoulder to lean on\n\nIt's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains\n\nAnd none of my rhymes are two and the same\n\nNigga get cooked on an open flame\n\nI'ma a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained\n\n\n\nMy rhyme starts riots in the mountains\n\nThirty-six million and countin'\n\nThe harder they come, the harder I go\n\nLoosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?\n\nStay on my tip-toes, old-school, Wu B\n\nThis is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'\n\nWhere I come from it stays snowin'\n\nThe grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door\n\nBeez bang bong in your jaw\n\nI hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor\n\nStars and bars, makes me a general\n\nAnything less, makes me a criminal\n\nGotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals\n\n\n\nG.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C\n\nOn the count of three, Wu-Tang\n\nFirst, master your breathin'\n\nI'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when\n\nI'm speakin' I'm a champion from Brooklyn\n\nI'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners\n\nAvenger, a righteous defender\n\nA grandmaster from the 36th Chamber\n\nWhole style is mentally strong\n\nSo strengthen your arms\n\nTo hold my microphone you need iron palms\n\nRemain calm, just mellow out\n\nBig wise chief Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah\n\n\n\nEnter a world of a universal mind of one kind\n\nA thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme\n\nFood for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logic, clear reasoning\n\nThe uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz\n\nSelf-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts\n\nA point-of-view of the thinkers\n\nMonumental architecture, amazing as the Incas\n\n\n\n(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)\n\nW.T.C., ah-ha\n\nThe faculty\n\nAin't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move\n\nNobody slide, you might get hurt\n\n\n\nEn garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style\n\nI'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then\n\nShaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style\n\nIf what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous\n\nDo you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?\""
