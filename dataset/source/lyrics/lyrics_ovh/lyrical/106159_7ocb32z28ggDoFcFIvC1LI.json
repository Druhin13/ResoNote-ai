  "lyrics": "I know it's hard to find the words so often standin' face-to-face\r\nSometimes it takes a thin white sheet to put things into place\r\nThings that I could never say come floodin' out somehow upon these lines\r\nI'm still fightin' the same battles I've been fightin' all these years\r\nDream is not a dream unless you're livin' with a fear\n\nWhat they say will be forgotten, all that's done will be for naught\n\nAnd why?\n\n\n\nAnd it's been a long time, Lord, since I sat down and had a cry\n\nIt's sometimes overwhelmin' and I can't tell ya why\n\nBut I remember Jackson singin' \"Doctor, doctor, please\"\n\nMy eyes\n\n\n\n\n\nMy heroes, they're all dyin' or they're sittin' in a cell\n\nDue to years of medicatin', minds that hurt so well\n\nThere's a thin line, don't you see, between genius and insanity\n\nWhich am I?\n\n\n\nOne thing that scares the hell in me is livin' with mortality\n\nAnd worryin' that I'm insane talkin' to a God unseen\n\nMust surely make me crazy, so crazy's what I'll be\n\n'Til I'm gone\n\n'Til I'm gone\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd I'll scream out to the sun and to the moon and to the stars\n\nI'll scream until my voice finds you, no matter where you are\n\nI'll scream until I've got no breath and all that's left to take is death\n\nAnd I'm done\n\nWhen I'm done\n\n\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh"
