  "lyrics": "I could turn my life from a good dream\r\nTo living in a nightmare, ruining a good thing\r\nProbably couldn't tell you how I got here\r\nBottom of the barrel, I been hanging here a lot\r\nI've always done what I want\r\nJust give me one more chance to mess it up\n\n\n\nI got pain in my mind and heart\n\nI can never stop it once it starts\n\nSomething in the way that could pull our charge\n\nI only ever hurt myself\n\n\n\nI got, I got problems\n\nI got, I got problems\n\n\n\nI know, I'm not perfect, but I'm trying\n\nWhen I do, I put a scratch on the silver lining\n\nIf I'm being honest, I've been lying\n\nI wanna tell the truth 'cause I'm sick of what I'm hiding\n\nI've always done what I want\n\nI know, I've done my share of messing up\n\n\n\nI got, I got problems\n\nI got, I got problems\n\nI'm sorry for the times I trip and I fall\n\nYou blame yourself, but it isn't you fault then\n\nI got, I got problems\n\n\n\nI got pain in my mind and heart\n\nI can never stop it once it starts\n\nSomething in the way that could pull our charge\n\nI only ever hurt myself\n\n\n\nI got, I got problems\n\nI got, I got problems\n\nI'm sorry for the times I trip and I fall\n\nYou blame yourself, but it isn't you fault then\n\nI got, I got problems\n\n\n\nI got problems"
