What is the place?\r\nSomebody help me outta here.\r\nOh I'm walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere\r\nOh I'm running slower, slower and slower to somewhere\r\n'Cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me\n\nIt's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare\n\nNo matter which way-mare\n\n\n\nSeems that there must be some way to get out.\n\nBut I just can't find it.\n\n\n\nPeople pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future\n\nWindows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to\n\nOh there's violence lurking in the alleys\n\nWhere no one should dare go\n\nSo keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere\n\n\n\nI gotta get out, somebody...\n\nthat guy came at me with a gun\n\nThe city closing in\n\n\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\n\n\nChildren crying, screaming, but no one lets on that they hear them\n\nIt's getting louder, louder, surely that someone must hear them\n\n'Cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me\n\nIt's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare\n\nNo matter which way-mare\n\n\n\nHelp me, I wanna get out.\n\nCut it out! Stop closing in on me HELP!!!\n\n\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little\n\nTrip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere\n\nWe're gonna take a little"
