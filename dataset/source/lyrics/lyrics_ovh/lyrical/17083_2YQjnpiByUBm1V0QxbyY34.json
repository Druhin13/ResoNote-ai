  "lyrics": "In a larval state\r\nDrinking a minimum wage\r\nI fell in with a girl so vastly superior\r\nShe wore Mardi Gras beads in her hair\r\nAnd I just can't get her out of my bed\n\nWish I'd gone with her sister instead\n\nLove life imploded\n\nMy dice were all loaded\n\nCan't get her out of my bed\n\n\n\nI know\n\nIf she gave a fuck then it would show\n\nAnd she wouldn't have me stabbing other boys\n\nLike it's just a bit of sweetness she enjoys\n\n\n\nDevil's daughter\n\nSo much for Simon's \"50 Ways...\"\n\nWhat can a lonely boy do when all else seems inferior\n\nNo come-along will pull me away\n\n\n\nAnd I just can't get her out of my bed\n\nShould've mainlined saltpeter instead\n\nMy vices have voted, her ass duly noted\n\nCan't kick her out of my bed\n\n\n\nHold on, maybe this girl is alright\n\nJust wants the benefit of a modern love life\n\nAnd I don't know the difference anymore\n\nI've turned making bad decisions into some kind of art form\n\nDon't mention boundaries on the phone\n\nThey slide and glide on out the door\n\n\n\nCan't get her out of my bed\n\nCan't get her out of my bed\n\nMy vices have voted, her ass duly noted\n\nCan't get her out of my bed\n\n\n\nSlow down\n\nI don't know what I'm hoping for\n\nSo silently I'm opening the latch\n\nI swear she'll be the last one I dispatch"
