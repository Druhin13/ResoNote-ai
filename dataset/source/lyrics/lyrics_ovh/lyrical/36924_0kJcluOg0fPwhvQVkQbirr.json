  "lyrics": "There was a boy, a little boy\r\nHe was created, built to destroy\r\nThough a life that is cursed\r\nBrought up by a lovely young girl\r\nGet into your veins\n\nRe-fabric rugged remains\n\nBlood pumping, metal on skin\n\nPoltergeist coming in\n\n\n\nPeter suffers every day\n\nCan't wake up, it's all the same\n\nI feel the sun burning my skin\n\nCover me up, and keep me in\n\n\n\nGet into your veins\n\nRe-fabric rugged remains\n\nBlood pumping, metal on skin\n\nPoltergeist, love's gone again"
