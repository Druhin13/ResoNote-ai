  "lyrics": "I would shun the light, sharin' evenings cool and quiet\r\nWho betrayed that I’m the night\r\nFor sunlight, sunlight, sunlight\r\nBut his heart would not take flight\r\nBetray the moon as acolyte\r\nI'm first and fierce if I'm in sight\n\nOf sunlight, sunlight, sunlight\n\n\n\nI have been lost in sunlight\n\nFlew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight\n\n\n\nAll the titles the same\n\nTold before and told again\n\nSoul that’s born in cold and rain\n\nOh, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight\n\nAt last, came burgeoning\n\nTo bury it in a burning flame\n\nIt's love and it's decisive pain\n\nOh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight\n\n\n\nAll that was shown to me, sunlight\n\nThere's somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight, oh sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight, sunlight\n\n\n\nOh, and these colors fade for you\n\nHold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight\n\nOh, and these colors fade for you\n\nHold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight\n\n\n\nEach day, you rise with me\n\nKnow that I would gladly be\n\nThe eucharist to your certainty\n\nOh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight\n\nYou strap the weight of me\n\nA death trap clad happily\n\nWith wax melted, I need to see\n\nUnder sunlight, sunlight, sunlight\n\n\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nAll we love is sunlight\n\nBut it is sunlight\n\n\n\nSunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight"
