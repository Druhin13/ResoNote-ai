  "lyrics": "Ooh, oh, oh\r\nTonight's the night I start again\r\nI’ll stop wondering where you've been\r\nAnd who you're going home to\r\nI’ll wear a smile and dress the part\n\nHold anybody in my arms, who I get close to\n\n\n\nTo just forget you, that's my plan\n\nAnd someone's offering their hand to me\n\n\n\nHere's my chance, and I'm not ready to dance\n\nI wanted to, but I don't think that I can\n\nAlone in this crowded room and my mind is on you, oh\n\nHere's my chance, and I'm not ready to dance\n\n\n\nSaid to myself I’ll just be strong\n\nRight before this song came on\n\nThat brings me right back\n\nGet up to leave, I’m going home\n\nBut I know I'll just be alone there\n\nI guess I’ll stay here\n\n\n\nTo just forget you, that's my plan\n\nAnd someone's offering their hand to me\n\n\n\nHere's my chance, and I’m not ready to dance\n\nI wanted to, but I don't think that I can\n\nAlone in this crowded room and my mind is on you, oh\n\nHere's my chance, and I'm not ready to dance\n\n\n\nThe hardest part of moving on\n\nIs when someone's offering their hand to me\n\n\n\nHere's my chance, and I'm not ready to dance\n\nI wanted to, but I just don't think that I can\n\nAlone in this crowded room and my mind is on you, oh\n\nHere's my chance, and I'm not ready to dance yet"
