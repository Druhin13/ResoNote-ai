  "lyrics": "Children it's time, we all recognize\r\nWith each passing day, the world's full of anger and hate\r\nA crime, our leaders are sick and malign\r\nLike sheep we don't step out of line\n\nRise up out of the deep\n\nThe time has come to\n\nRise up, wake from your sleep\n\nFrom hate, to love, the time has come to rise\n\n\n\nPolluting the skies, the temperatures rise\n\nWe're way past no return\n\nGod tell me when will we learnâ€¦\n\n\n\nOh why the blind keep on leading the blind\n\nIf we wait we'll run out of time\n\n\n\nRise up out of the deep\n\nThe time has come to\n\nRise up, wake from your sleep\n\nFrom hate, to love, the time has come to rise\n\n\n\nRise up out of the deep\n\nThe time has come to\n\nRise up, wake from your sleep\n\n\n\nRise Up\n\n\n\nRise Up\n\nThe time has come to Rise up\n\nRise up\n\nFrom hate, to love, the time has come to rise"
