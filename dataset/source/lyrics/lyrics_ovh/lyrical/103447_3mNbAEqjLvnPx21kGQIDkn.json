  "lyrics": "You're all in but I fold\r\nYou're still falling but I'm frozen\r\nAnd I can't sleep cause you don't know\r\nHow I'm feeling, I'm gone\r\nWhen you say my name like that\n\nI feel pain, I feel pain\n\nWhen you say my name like that\n\nI can't stay, I can't stay\n\n\n\nIf my hands were a lie I'd lie to you\n\nWhile we laid upon the bed we made\n\nIf my lips were a joke\n\nI fooled you and broke\n\nEvery touch is a lie\n\nAnd a good feels like goodbye\n\n\n\nLong drives turns to late nights\n\nWe were reckless, you were right\n\nBut I can't see where we're going\n\nI went off road on my own\n\n\n\nWhen you say my name like that\n\nI feel pain, I feel pain\n\nWhen you say my name like that\n\nI can't stay, oh I can't stay\n\n\n\nIf my hands were a lie I'd lie to you\n\nWhile we laid upon the bed we made\n\nIf my lips were a joke\n\nI fooled you and broke\n\nThe promises you knew I'd break\n\n\n\nYou give me it all, but I can't take it\n\nYou tell me I'm yours but I can't fake it\n\nI'm sorry, I'm so sorry\n\n'Cause every touch is a lie\n\nAnd the good feels like goodbye\n\n\n\n(Huh-huh, woah\n\nHuh-huh, woah\n\nHuh-huh, woah\n\nGood feels like, woah)\n\n\n\nI laid on your chest till there's nothing left\n\nHear your heartbeat when I close the door\n\nThe scent that you left made me second guess\n\nI wish that I missed you more\n\n\n\nIf my hands were a lie I'd lie to you\n\nWhile we'd lay upon the bed we made\n\nIf my lips were a joke\n\nI fooled you and broke\n\nThe promises you knew I'd break\n\n\n\nYou give me it all, but I can't take it\n\nYou tell me I'm yours but I can't fake it\n\nI'm sorry, I'm so sorry\n\n'Cause every touch is a lie, and the good feels like goodbye\n\nGood feels like goodbye\n\n'Cause every touch is a lie, and the good feels like goodbye"
