  "lyrics": "I met a rich man in his mansion, but he was poor in soul\r\nSaid he could feel those demons dancin' all around his home\r\nHe said \"Not everything that counts can be counted\"\r\nSo it don't always means it counts just 'cause you can count it\r\nThat's a poor man's mansion\n\nI would call it quiets walk away from all of them\n\nWatch my kingdom crumblin' and just laugh at the thought of it\n\nPick up all them pieces, rebuild it like I'm [?]\n\nI hit bottom, then climbed out the hole I had fallen in\n\nNever would have found my way, if I would have followed trends\n\nYou can loose your soul a lot faster than the dollar spends\n\nSpin the bottle, kiss the devil\n\nPay your dues, the debt is settled\n\nIf they go next it makes your head bang, it's heavy metal\n\nIt's a big facade, young peacock spread them feathers\n\nPaint a pleasure, it's what ever, life is just for playin' checkers\n\nWealth is not measured in treasures\n\nQuit treasurin' your wealth 'fore you die a lonely death\n\nMake bet\n\n\n\nI met a rich man in his mansion, but he was poor in soul\n\nSaid he could feel those demons dancin' all around his home\n\nHe said \"Not everything that counts can be counted\"\n\nSo it don't always means it counts just 'cause you can count it\n\nThat's a poor man's mansion\n\n\n\nAlright this man will fall several times, but can still find a way\n\nI think about that scripture every time that I'm tryin' to pray\n\nGames I ain't tryin' to play, hard to articulate\n\nI know we'll be held accountable for all the shit we say\n\nBeen dreamin' of demons and burnin' houses\n\nBurnin' ounces, stressed, I won't say a word about it\n\nI met a man who had it all, but he wished he'd let it go\n\nHe said he felt to get it all he had to sacrifice his soul\n\nHighs and lows come and go, but the pain is the pain\n\nThe pain ain't easier to change, then he'll remain the same\n\nI keep havin' these bad thoughts, stuck in old patterns\n\nRelive the past daily, I can hear my soul shatter\n\nThe man told me I must believe in somethin'\n\nAnd if I don't the past will catch me, I won't see it comin'\n\nWhy does the heart desire when we're in need of nothin'?\n\nAnd all the things we acquire take the freedom from us\n\nThat's real\n\n\n\nI met a rich man in his mansion, but he was poor in soul\n\nSaid he could feel those demons dancin' all around his home\n\nHe said \"Not everything that counts can be counted\"\n\nSo it don't always means it counts just 'cause you can count it\n\nThat's a poor man's mansion"
