  "lyrics": "I used to want people to love me, so I learned how to sing\r\nThen I thought I wanted money, so I could buy nice things\r\nWhen I found it was as empty as could be\r\nAnd now I'm staring at my face above a bathroom sink\r\nSaying I want peace, it's where I am now\n\nIt's the only thing I haven't found, somehow\n\nThere are other places, there are a million pretty faces\n\nBut I want peace, it's where I am now\n\n\n\nI used to worry about the future, but the future never came\n\nTried livin' in the past, but never did quite feel the same\n\nI used to think that there was a place I would rather be\n\n'Til I got there enough times to realize that you are only ever here\n\n\n\nThat's when I found peace with where I am now\n\nIt's the only place I'll ever be, I've found (yeah)\n\nThere are other places, filled with a million pretty faces\n\nBut I've found peace with where I am now\n\n\n\nThrough the ups and downs, I have figured out\n\nYou find peace where you make it\n\nScenery won't change it\n\nAnd I wasted so much time, thinkin' I could ever find\n\nEnough of anything\n\nThat would bring me peace\n\n\n\nSo I found peace with who I am now\n\nIt's the only me I'll ever be, I've found (yeah)\n\nThere are other places, there are a million other faces\n\nBut I found peace with who I am now"
