  "lyrics": "I wanna lose my hands in your curls\r\nI wanna show you it's more than words\r\nI gotta take it slow with your curse\r\nI know it's more than love you deserve\r\nCan't you tell that I'm gon' treat you right?\n\nI see it in your eyes that if my words desire\n\nAnd you forget how my many nights tried\n\nHow many times you tried\n\nThis might just be your night\n\n\n\nHold me down, down, down, down, down\n\nHold me down on love, hold me down on love\n\nI hold you down, down, down, down, down\n\nIf you stay around my love, stay around my love\n\n\n\nI wanna show you how good it feels\n\nThat heaven knows, someone who treats you real\n\nCaught up in the motion, I'm not made of steel\n\nBaby, if you're hopeless I can help you heal\n\n\n\nCan't you tell that I'm gon' treat you right?\n\nI see it in your eyes that if my words desire\n\nAnd you forget how my many nights tried\n\nHow many times you tried\n\nThis might just be your night\n\n\n\nHold me down, down, down, down, down\n\nHold me down on love, hold me down on love\n\nI hold you down, down, down, down, down\n\nIf you stay around my love, stay around my love\n\n\n\nHold me down, hold me down, hold me down\n\nI hold you down, down, down, down, down\n\n\n\nHold me down, down, down, down, down\n\nHold me down on love, hold me down on love\n\nI hold you down, down, down, down, down\n\nIf you stay around my love, stay around my love"
