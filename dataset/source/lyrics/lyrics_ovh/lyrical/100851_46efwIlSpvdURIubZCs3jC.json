Villain!\r\nI warm it up like Kane in his prime\r\nFuck with us, you insane in the mind\r\nYou cowards way out of line\r\nMoney talk, boy you wastin' my time\n\nYou don't want to put the work in\n\nYou just want a taste of the shine\n\nReal talk, so it's hard to trust\n\nI'm in it for the long ride, like I drive a charter bus\n\nScars and blood, from the deadly bars I bust\n\nIn Czar we trust, the army buy they bombs off us\n\nBlog about it naysayer, you can hardly doubt it\n\nWho's the best? Who's the worst? We could argue hours\n\nRunnin' through soldier field, I'm Jordan Howard\n\nNowadays they respect money more than power\n\nMoney, power, respect, we all want some\n\nI ain't waitin', I needed it, one lump sum\n\nMade men trade hands with young guns\n\nThey stopped manufacturin' the cloth that I'm cut from\n\n\n\nI be laughin' at the beef as though I'm body-shamin' exes\n\nOnly time you set-trip is when you binge on Netflix\n\nReckless, run it up like, \"Eso, listen please\n\nAlright I like the beat except the snare, kick and keys\"\n\nGeez, I teach but I kill them when the class on\n\nSo I got no pupils like Spidey with the mask on\n\nGenerally speaking, each rhyme is five star\n\nSplit personality, I ride with a side car\n\nI can't think of the rhyme, it must be misplaced\n\nIt's on the tip of my tongue like Stan Smith's face\n\nHold on - hmm, something 'bout a fly sound\n\nAnd how you got no bars like a dry town\n\nSo pipe down, the beat bumps like bad skin\n\n\"Captain gonna teach stuff\", shout to Kraglin that's the line, yo\n\nLet the mind take you where the cameras can't\n\nIt's very necessary like a Q-Tip Grammy rant\n\n\n\n(DOOM was imminent)\n\n\n\nDue to jet lag, good afternoon or is that night?\n\nMilitants speak proper, some airheads said he act white\n\nCatch flight, bread good so he tends to pack light\n\nGot jokes, but usually don't engage in no snap fight\n\nCould be considered a waste confrontin' snakes on the back bite\n\nDetrimental to culture that they lack sight, ass-wipe\n\nCatch him on stage, mad hype, with a trashed mic\n\nMonth later, in the gutter, glass pipe and a flashlight\n\nLookin' 'round for something, he still scurry\n\nBewilder, incite riots, the mind's gone blurry\n\nThere wasn't really shit to say, much to they chagrin or dismay\n\nThe licks had 'em on the ropes, then he made a big mistake and hit the hay\n\nWent home and hit the day\n\nBurn the midnight oil and freak the shit a different way\n\nDisaster, time is a component\n\nSettin' fire to rappers in a monumental moment\n\nAnd the game's potent, it's like a never-ending quotient\n\nA minute ago it was smiles and hugs, now where the fuck the dough went?\n\nHe so bent it's like he set the shit straight again\n\nBombs fittin' to drop and he ain't even close to sayin' when\n\n(V-V-Villain) Nothin' ever stolen\n\nWas given as a blessin', think the universe owe him\n\nGot faith in the vessel but know when to keep rowin'\n\nYeah and get up out your own way when deliverin' a poem\n\nThose who think they do, don't know him\n\nNo different than a squad of birds ready to blow him\n\nSorry Charlie, get back up on your Harley\n\nWin, lose or draw, plus beat you at Atari\n\nDrop they ass deep in some far-off Safari\n\nAnd prob'ly even got the answer to, \"Who the hell are we?\"\n\nMetal Face squad drone, tell the real ones, \"Shalom\"\n\nIn a calm tone, bomb thrown"
