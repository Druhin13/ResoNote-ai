  "lyrics": "Door clicks while his wheels start spinning on the pavement\r\nAnd I go fill the space up where he has been staying\r\nWon't lose much sleep, he never went that deep\r\n\"Love you,\" oh, you sweet thing, no, I never said that\r\nLet me hold your ego while you get your bag packed\r\nDon't take this the wrong way\n\nBut when the spade shows up, I call it by its first name\n\n\n\nWe were, we were never gonna catch fire\n\nWe'd've burned up in the flames\n\nLong before they ever rose up higher\n\nSomeday, I, I won't have to feel the cold, but I do now\n\nSo I'll know what it feels like when I feel fire, fire\n\n\n\nMmm, fire\n\nFire\n\n\n\nTalk, touch, kiss, bend, this one's just like all the others\n\nAnd I know all too well that I won't beat the waters\n\nI held my breath to swim\n\nThe shallow shores aren't safe enough to dive in\n\n\n\nWe were, we were never gonna catch fire\n\nWe'd've burned up in the flames\n\nLong before they ever rose up higher\n\nSomeday, I, I won't have to feel the cold, but I do now\n\nSo I'll know what it feels like when I feel fire, fire\n\n\n\nThat comes-and-stays fire\n\nOn-blood-and-veins fire\n\nI've only ever wanted fire\n\nIn my chest, in my mouth, on my tongue, in my mind\n\nIn my soul, so my lungs can breathe in fire\n\n\n\nWe'd've burned up in the flames\n\nLong before they ever rose up higher\n\nSomeday, I, I won't have to feel the cold, but I do now\n\nSo I'll know what it feels like when I feel fire, fire"
