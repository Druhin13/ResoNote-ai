  "title": "Here",
  "lyrics": "Here is a region of abundant details\r\nHere is a region that is seldom used\r\nHere is a region that continues living\r\nEven when the other sections are removed\r\nPut your hand out of your pocket\n\nWipe the sweat off of your brow\n\nNow it feels like a bad connection\n\nNo more information now\n\n\n\nAs it passes through your neurons\n\nLike a whisper in the dark\n\nRaise your eyes to the one who loves you\n\nIt is safe right where you are\n\n\n\nHere is an area\n\nOf great confusion\n\nHere is a section\n\nThat's extremely precise\n\n\n\nAnd here is an area\n\nThat needs attention\n\nHere is a connection\n\nWith an opposite side\n\n\n\nHere is many sounds\n\nFor your brain to comprehend\n\nHere the sound is organised\n\nInto things that make some sense\n\n\n\nHere there is something\n\nWe call hallucination\n\nIs it the truth or merely a description"
