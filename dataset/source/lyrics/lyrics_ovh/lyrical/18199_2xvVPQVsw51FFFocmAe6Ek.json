  "lyrics": "Impatiently I wait to refill my prescription\r\nAnd count the tock of the drugstore clock\r\nA prototype they say to combat my affliction\r\nExtra gravity to control me\r\nBut thatâ€™s my fun and I like fun\n\nAnd so do you\n\nAs we float away\n\nSo do you\n\nAs we float away\n\n\n\nMy excellence at parkour\n\nIs not to be discounted\n\nAs I leap away and disappear\n\nMy excellence at parkour might be unexpected\n\nAt the age of 58 it comes as quite a surprise\n\n\n\nBut not to you\n\nWe float away\n\nNot to you\n\nAs we float away"
