  "lyrics": "Potholes of rain reflected the stop lights\r\nThe world fell asleep but I'm wide wake\r\nListening to traffic on the highway, from half a mile away\r\nI'm looking up in my family, kaleidoscope\r\nI'm trying to float with some harmony, hit some higher notes\r\nAnd I don't know if I'm supposed to cover your eyes\n\nBut I chose to hold your hand and watch the sun rise\n\nLive within the gift, recognize the warnings\n\nMemorize the answers, this is a recording\n\nI love you 'til the moon and back\n\nThere's nothing new 'bout that, it's just a proven fact\n\nAnd somewhere my dad is listening to the engine burn\n\nSomeday I'm gonna finish my verse\n\nI inherited that free-refills-type thirst\n\nI'm counting on my children to break this curse\n\nIt goes\n\n\n\nI don't know how much time we have left\n\nBut I promise you that when I breathe my last breath\n\nI'mma exhale and remember your birth\n\nIt's never too late to get some heaven on earth\n\nI don't know how much time we have left\n\nBut I promise you that when I breathe my last breath\n\nI'mma exhale and remember your birth\n\nIt's never too late to get some heaven on earth\n\n\n\nIt's funny right\n\nOur only reason that we're trying to find this money is to buy us some time\n\nRise and shine, I got away these fish\n\nTo educate my kids on how to bait they lines\n\nI wonder if this is how the aliens felt\n\nJust 'cause the hate theyself, don't mean they change theyself, nah\n\nStill chasing after gratification\n\nAt this point I ain't even know what that would take\n\nDon't make a mess in your drawers just to get some applause\n\nYou don't wanna be the bullet that your ex has dodged (haha)\n\nAnother bomber sticker, but it's enough to consider not to jump in the river\n\nI can play the xylophone out of a pile of bones\n\nBut sometimes can't even find the stones to dial your phone\n\nI built a whole kingdom out of styrofoam\n\nAnd you can have it when I'm gone\n\n\n\nI don't know how much time we have left\n\nBut I promise you that when I breathe my last breath\n\nI'mma exhale and remember your birth\n\nIt's never too late to get some heaven on earth\n\nI don't know how much time we have left\n\nBut I promise you that when I breathe my last breath\n\nI'mma exhale and remember your birth\n\nIt's never too late to get some heaven on earth"
