  "lyrics": "An honest life, some peace at night\r\nNo need to hide, a mind that's right\r\nThese are all the things that I would've had if I never met you\r\nA heart to beat, some blood to heat\r\nThese are all the things that I would've had\n\nYou were my highest high, you were my lowest low\n\nYou were the downtown where I would walk alone\n\nYou were the best I ever had, you were the best I ever had\n\nYou were my golden days, you were my endless nights\n\nYou almost broke me down so now I say goodbye\n\nYou were the best I ever had, you were the best I ever had\n\n\n\nI was eighteen with darker dreams\n\nI felt your jeans and dopamine\n\nYou were dangerous but you killed the pain I had before I met you\n\nYou pulled me out, out of my doubts\n\nOnce you little fire in my mind each day\n\n\n\nYou were my highest high, you were my lowest low\n\nYou were the downtown where I would walk alone\n\nYou were the best I ever had, you were the best I ever had\n\nYou were my golden days, you were my endless nights\n\nYou almost broke me down so now I say goodbye\n\nYou were the best I ever had, you were the best I ever had\n\n\n\nYou leave me for dead\n\nThen kiss my lips and give me your breath\n\nI leave you for a week\n\nThe world's bitter and you taste so sweet\n\nI needed the joy that came from the pain you stole, you stole\n\nI won't die for you\n\nSo I live alone\n\n\n\nYou were my highest high, you were my lowest low\n\nYou were the downtown where I would walk alone\n\nYou were the best I ever had, you were the best I ever had\n\nYou were my golden days, you were my endless nights\n\nYou almost broke me down so now I say goodbye\n\nYou were the best I ever had, you were the best I ever had"
