  "lyrics": "(Intro) \nSometimes, relationships, ya know \nSomehow they just don't work out \nYou gotta do what you gotta do \nYou know... \n\n\n(Verse 1) \n\nDamn, we tried so hard to get it right \n\nBut this relationship has been denied \n\nBetween the sheets we thought that \n\nEverything would be alright \n\nTalk, that's something we both used to do \n\nBut now you always got an attitude \n\nDon't know what we're supposed to do \n\nAnd I don't know what to say, but... \n\n\n\n(Chorus) \n\nIs this pain our pleasure \n\n'Cause all we do is fight \n\nBeen so wrong for so long, girl \n\nThat it's feeling right \n\nIs this pain our pleasure \n\n'Cause all we do is fight \n\nBeen so wrong for so long, girl \n\nThat it's feeling right \n\n\n\n(Verse 2) \n\nI'm looking at you baby, lookin' so good \n\nWhen any man sees you, it's understood \n\nWhy I would do the things I do \n\nJust to be with you \n\nOh I love you \n\nAnd then sometimes I feel that I can't stand you \n\nBut I just can't bring myself to leave you \n\nAnd you keep pushing me away from you \n\nAnd I don't know what to say, hey... \n\n\n\n(Chorus) \n\n\n\n(Bridge) \n\nOh why, oh why, oh why \n\nDo we do what we do, baby \n\nAnd why we fuss and fight \n\nBetween me and you, baby \n\n\n\n(Chorus) x 2 \n\n\n\nGood-bye, good-bye \n\nGood-bye, good-bye \n\nGood-bye, good-bye \n\nGood-bye, good-bye... \n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Mokz for these lyrics)"
