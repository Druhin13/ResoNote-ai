  "lyrics": "I know I ain't supposed to smoke in here but Mr. Bouncer man don't put your motherfuckin' hands on me\rCan I get high without you botherin' me?\rEverybody you see in here tonight doin' the same thing so why you keep playa hatin' on me\rCan I get high without you botherin' me?\rHook\rla la la la. I be smokin'\rIt hitten me right I'll be loakin'\rThem bullshit trees you be rollin'\rbarely give you a buzz, me i get HIGH\rrepeat\rVerse 1\rI admit i got a problem, I keep comin' back for these\rDodo bags there not your yak or your sack o' seeds\rI chill sit back on the sofa and relax my knees\rAnd roll one up loose enough to make the backwards breathe\rI blow a heavy load, you kids attract some G's.\rCause I'm a smoker, too much o' this would choke ya'\rI don't mean to provoke ya, but i'm a bad influence\rThe musician can't operate without his instruments\rMy recent success gradually got your bitch convinced\rHaters mad they can't look inside cause i pitched the tints\rI enter the club with baggies of that chocolate\rSecond-hand smoke will make a nigga wanna start shit.\rSometimes I wonder where the niggas from the start went\rRaise up a lighter and fuck up the whole apartment.\rIt's just one of the things I do in my spare time\rMy bad habits ain't private so I'm gon share mine.\rHookx2\rSee they put their hands out cause of the way shit been\rI say you niggers ain't smokin' if you don't chip in.\rListen. I waited long for these rocks to glisten\rFrom that one-room pad without a pot to piss in\rAlthough betrayal is not forgiven\rI do this for my niggas locked up that's comin home to lobster livin'\rHopin' the cops forbiddin'\rI'm bout to buy momma her own mansion\rjust so I could see her pop the ribbon.\rThat Cali bud's special, so special i held the blunt so long\rSnoop had to tell me \"Pass the weed, Nephew\"\rFuck rap I'm the wrong one to get pissed off\rCause the pope'll make you jump like criss cross.\rMy nigga dead and it's hard to let go,\rso i'm blowin on that wet dough, same color as Gecko\rFollow hood codes and everybody in the Sentinal\rWe gas 'em Fuck 'em and Pass 'em what you expect hoe?\rHookx2\rSnoop Dogg\rSaid you want to blow with the best of them\rYes yes i bested them\rblazed up the purple palm tree\rI told you don't mess with them\rI warned them new testament\rDo you wanna smoke with me? (do you wanna)\rWeed rollin', G-strollin', bad-mouthin', mofucker\rLaw breakin' Pimp, slappin niggas for the fuck of it\rHip-hop an zip lock an rip rockin gang banger\rThought you was an actor, thought i was a singer\rThought about ridin' but you say you wanna hang tough\rD-P-G-Unit sounds like danger\rYou might wanna manage your anger\rhang with us and stop smokin' on the same stuff\rNow lay back on the loft\rThis new weed that i got i call it face-off\rCause it'll blow your face off and that's a figure of speech,\rMy niggas a beast, on me from the west to the east, preach\rHookx2\rSha da da"
