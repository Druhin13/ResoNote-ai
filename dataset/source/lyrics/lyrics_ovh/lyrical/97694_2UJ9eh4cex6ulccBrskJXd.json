  "title": "Take Me Home, Country Roads",
  "lyrics": "Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River\r\nLife is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze\r\nCountry roads, take me home to the place I belong\r\nWest Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads\n\nAll my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water\n\nDark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye\n\n\n\nCountry roads, take me home to the place I belong\n\nWest Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads\n\n\n\nI hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away\n\nAnd driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday\n\n\n\nCountry roads, take me home to the place I belong\n\nWest Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads\n\n\n\nCountry roads, take me home to the place I belong\n\nWest Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads\n\n\n\nTake me home now, country roads\n\nTake me home now, country roads"
