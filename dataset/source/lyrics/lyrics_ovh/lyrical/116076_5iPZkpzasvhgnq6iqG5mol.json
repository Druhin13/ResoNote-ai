  "lyrics": "I don't want you to talk to me\r\nThe way you're acting tells me everything\r\nThis feels like a recipe\r\nFor disaster but it's missing something\r\nI don't wanna know what you did\n\nI don't want the pictures in my head\n\nI don't wanna hear your words\n\nControlling my thoughts when I'm in bed\n\nFlicking through me, tryna make me lose my mind, all the time\n\nI think about leaving but it's hard to find it\n\n\n\nAnother you\n\nAnother you\n\n\n\nYou've already rolled the dice\n\nYou've been living in paradise for a while now\n\nAnd I don't know why it feels like I'm stuck\n\nBut I don't wanna find out\n\n\n\nI don't wanna know what you did\n\nI don't want the pictures in my head\n\nI don't wanna hear your words\n\nControlling my thoughts when I'm in bed\n\nFlicking through me, tryna make me lose my mind, all the time\n\nI think about leaving but it's hard to find it\n\n\n\nAnother you\n\nAnother you"
