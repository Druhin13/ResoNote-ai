How do you serve the question?\n\nSee, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world\n\nI don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world\n\nI don't love people enough to put my faith in man\n\nI put my faith in these lyrics hoping I make amend\n\nI understand I ain't perfect\n\nI probably won't come around\n\nThis time, I might put you down\n\nLast time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now\n\nMy feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb\n\nI'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from\n\nPity parties and functions and you and yours\n\nA perfect world, you probably live another 24\n\nI can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure\n\nI can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure\n\n\n\nIt wasn't all to share, but there\n\nIn another life, I surely was there\n\nIt wasn't all to share, but there\n\nI care, I care\n\n\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\n\n\nNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive\n\nCold as December, but never remember what winter did\n\nI wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid\n\nSeems like I point the finger just to make a point, nowadays\n\nSmiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there\n\nIndigenous disposition, feel like we belong here\n\nI know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back\n\nThe hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that\n\nSick venom in men and women overcome with pride\n\nA perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies\n\nPromises are broken and more resentment come alive\n\nRace barriers make inferior of you and I\n\nSee, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches\n\nI'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison\n\nI'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service\n\nJust to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world\n\n\n\nIt wasn't all to share, but there\n\nIn another life, I surely was there\n\nIt wasn't all to share, but there\n\nI care, I care\n\n\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nMaybe I wasn't there"
