  "lyrics": "You gave me love to enjoy\r\nLike a bright shiny toy to a baby\r\nNo matter what you would do\r\nI depended on you like a baby\r\nOne thing I know I love you\n\nYes I loved you like a baby\n\nIt was a fool that you took\n\nAnd I think 'cause you look like a baby\n\n\n\nTo lover's ways I was blind\n\n'Cause I just had a mind like a baby\n\nYou're just a flirt\n\nAnd I had to be her guide like a baby\n\n\n\nI need you so, I need you so\n\nThe day I found I am alive\n\nThen I broke down and cried like a baby\n\nWell it was then I could see\n\nYou were playing with me like a baby\n\nWell you can bet that some day\n\nI'll forget just like a baby"
