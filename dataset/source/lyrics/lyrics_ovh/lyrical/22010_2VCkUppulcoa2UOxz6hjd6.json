  "lyrics": "This isn't how your story ends, my friends\r\nIt's just a fork along the road\r\nDon't say your prayers, save your amens\r\nYou've come this far, but you're still far from home\r\nDon't say goodbye, just say farewell\r\nWrite every line you live to tell\n\nHold your head like Harry, give 'em hell\n\nAs the night ignites the day\n\nMake some memories along the way\n\n\n\nWrite your song, sing along, love your life\n\nLearn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky\n\nTake pictures each step of the way\n\nMake this the best of the rest of your days\n\nStart your revolution and I'll see you at the reunion\n\n\n\nSome friends will go and some will stay\n\nOkay, some last a chapter, some a page\n\nFor some love comes disguised as lust\n\nBut you'll find love when you find trust one day\n\nDo better than our parents did\n\nImperfect husband, wife, and kids\n\nGo chart your course then turn it upside down\n\nGo live your life, eyes open wide\n\nWho's to say what's wrong or right, right?\n\n\n\nWrite your song, sing along, love your life\n\nLearn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky\n\nTake pictures each step of the way\n\nMake this the best of the rest of your days\n\nStart your own revolution and I'll see you at the reunion\n\nWell, I'll see you at the reunion\n\n\n\nAs the night ignites the day\n\nWe'll make some memories along the way\n\n\n\nWrite your song, sing along, love your life\n\nLearn to laugh, dare to dance, touch the sky\n\nTake pictures each step of the way\n\nMake this the best of the rest of your days\n\nI say, go start your own revolution\n\nAnd I'll see you at the reunion\n\nI'll see you at the reunion\n\nI'll see you at the reunion\n\n\n\nThis isn't how your story ends, my friends\n\nIt's just a fork along the road"
