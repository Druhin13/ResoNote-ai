  "lyrics": "Moving in and out of the shadow\r\nIt's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you\r\nShowing only bits and pieces\r\n'Til the light betray you and your empty allocution\n\nSearching your eyes for a hint or a trace of humility\n\nSearching your eyes for the saint is an act of futility\n\n\n\nSearching your eyes for a hint or trace of it\n\nSearching your eyes for humility\n\nSearching your eyes for a hint or a trace\n\nI'm still searching, searching\n\n\n\nShowing only bits and pieces\n\n'Til the tide betrays you and your empty elocution\n\nFloat the Piper by and down the river\n\nCarcass crippled underneath the pounding waves of adoration\n\n\n\nPied Piper, float on down the river\n\nBloated carcass crippled me, the weight of adoration\n\nMoving in and out of the shadows\n\nIt's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you"
