Will it save us from our sin? Will it?\n\n'Cause this house of mine stands strong\n\n\n\nThat's the price you pay\n\nLeave behind your heart and cast away\n\nJust another product of today\n\nRather be the hunter than the prey\n\nAnd you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...\n\n\n\nNatural\n\nA beating heart of stone\n\nYou gotta be so cold\n\nTo make it in this world\n\nYeah, you're a natural\n\nLiving your life cutthroat\n\nYou gotta be so cold\n\nYeah, you're a natural\n\n\n\nWill somebody\n\nLet me see the light within the dark trees' shadows and\n\nWhat's happenin'?\n\nLookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'\n\nOh, we are the youth\n\nCall out to the beast, not a word without the peace, facing\n\nA bit of the truth, the truth\n\n\n\nThat's the price you pay\n\nLeave behind your heart and cast away\n\nJust another product of today\n\nRather be the hunter than the prey\n\nAnd you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...\n\n\n\nNatural\n\nA beating heart of stone\n\nYou gotta be so cold\n\nTo make it in this world\n\nYeah, you're a natural\n\nLiving your life cutthroat\n\nYou gotta be so cold\n\nYeah, you're a natural\n\n\n\nDeep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading\n\nTook an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it\n\nI can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear\n\nGonna make it\n\nI'm gonna make it\n\n\n\nNatural\n\nA beating heart of stone\n\nYou gotta be so cold\n\nTo make it in this world\n\nYeah, you're a natural\n\nLiving your life cutthroat\n\nYou gotta be so cold\n\nYeah, you're a natural\n\n\n\nNatural\n\nYeah, you're a natural"
