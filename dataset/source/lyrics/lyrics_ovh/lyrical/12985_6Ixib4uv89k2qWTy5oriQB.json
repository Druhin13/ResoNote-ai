  "lyrics": "The stones that gather left forever damned\r\nThe absence of what was and what one can't understand\r\nThe undertow that drags as you lose another day\r\nThe voice that brought you peace has nothing left to say\r\nThe ashes that fall one more time\n\nMourn the past and all that once shined\n\n\n\nAs hope begins to falter in this void where you reside\n\nThe spiral into nothing where you confide\n\n\n\nThe ashes that fall one more time\n\nMourn the past and all that once shined\n\n\n\nI keep my silence\n\nDon't need to approve\n\nIf I walk away\n\nIt's what I choose\n\nOh yeah!\n\n\n\nThe ashes that fall one more time\n\nMourn the past and all that once shined"
