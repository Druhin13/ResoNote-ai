  "lyrics": "There's a house over the hill that somebody died in\r\nThere's a pool down in the backyard I would love to lie in\r\nIt's the first time that I'm in the Hills, I kind of like it\r\nSo I hope you don't leave me alone\r\nYou got celebs on the left and right working the night shift\r\nCan't tell if they lying to my face, they come off righteous\n\nNo way I could match the old days to what half this night is\n\nSo I pray you don't leave me alone\n\n\n\nAin't tripping on my leather seats, my windows down\n\n'Cause it hurts for me to know, hurts for me to know\n\nVeins ripping, oh, don't let them see how I changed the sound\n\nYeah, it hurts for me to know\n\nI'm not a tourist no more, no more\n\n\n\nMercedes Benz on these narrow streets I'm tryna ride in\n\nDrug dealers in their mansions that they love to hide in\n\nDog days, but many Cali nights, we start to like this\n\nSo I hope that you leave me alone\n\n\n\nAin't tripping on my leather seats, my windows down\n\n'Cause it hurts for me to know, hurts for me to know\n\nVeins ripping, oh, don't let them see how I changed the sound\n\nYeah, it hurts for me to know\n\nI'm not a tourist no more, no more\n\nI'm not a tourist no more, no more, no\n\n\n\n10 years have gone by and I'm burning up, I'm burning up\n\nRemind me now, why did I run out here?\n\nRumors on the side that I'm earning some, but not enough\n\nMoney and love from you is true\n\n\n\nAin't tripping on my leather seats, my windows down\n\n'Cause it hurts for me to know, hurts for me to know\n\nVeins ripping, oh, don't let them see how I changed the sound\n\nYeah, it hurts for me to know\n\nI'm not a tourist no more, no more\n\nI'm not a tourist no more, no more\n\nI'm not a tourist, no"
