  "lyrics": "All I needed was fifty dollars a week\r\nAnd a gas tank that leaked\r\nAnd a place to call home\r\nDidn't care if my hands got dirty\r\nOr if I made it to thirty\r\nAt least we weren't alone\n\n\n\nMaybe I should be more like I used to be\n\nI should be more like I used to be\n\nAnd yeah, the sails have set\n\nBut I'm not dead yet\n\n\n\nWhat we had, we made it work\n\nWith a shrug and a smirk\n\nLike when Fletcher got robbed\n\nWe could kill a day from noon to nine\n\nOn the stoop, just fine\n\nNow we all got jobs\n\n\n\nMaybe I should be more like I used to be\n\nI should be more like I used to be\n\nAnd yeah, the sails have set\n\nBut I'm not dead yet\n\n\n\nI could count on one hand right\n\nAll the hours I slept each night\n\nOh yeah, the sails have set\n\nBut I'm not, not dead yet\n\nI could count on one hand right\n\nAll the hours I slept each night\n\nOh yeah, the sails have set\n\nBut I'm not, not dead yet"
