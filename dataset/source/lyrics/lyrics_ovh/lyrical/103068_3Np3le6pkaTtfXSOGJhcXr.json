  "lyrics": "L.A.'s asleep - you roll up your window\r\nThe night air is cold - the freeway is clear.\r\nIn a green Gucci bag - are you prized possessions\r\nThe jewels of your mind - to hold back the fear. \nAnd when Monday comes round - there's a high lonesome sound\n\nAnd she follows you down for the kill.\n\nAnd a white blinding light - makes it all seem so right\n\nAnd you feel like the king of the hill. \n\n\n\nThe driveway is long - your princess is lovely\n\nYour servants all wait - for your knock on the door.\n\nHow many years - will you crawl through this castle\n\nSo satisfied - and still wanting more.\n\nAnd when Monday comes... \n\n\n\nThe guests have arrived - with all the right faces\n\nBut you miss the ball - in that room down the hall.\n\nIt's sunrise again - the driveway is empty\n\nThe crystal is cracked - there's blood on the wall.\n\nAnd when Monday comes round..."
