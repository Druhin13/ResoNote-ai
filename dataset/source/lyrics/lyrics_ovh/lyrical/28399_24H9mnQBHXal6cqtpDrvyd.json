Three\n\nMystery schools in ancient Egypt, alien science equipped\n\nHovered above in three ships large enough to eclipse\n\nThe sun/son, the widow, the virgin mother Mary\n\nA sprig of acacia found inside a cemetery\n\nLet's talk of hieroglyphics not the pseudoscientific\n\nThe phony spirit healers or a reading by ya mystic\n\nThe snake oil sellers or some fabricated cleric\n\nWho speak of all religion to exploit the esoteric\n\nThe crystal rubber, card reader, Ouija board controller\n\nThe spell caster, cult leader or some holy roller\n\nThe soul sucker, vampire feedin' off ya energy\n\nAnd people still believe in some imaginary enemy\n\nI never look to the skies to say a prayer\n\nThere's no mystical wizard who's up there\n\nEverything that ever was is everywhere\n\nSo let's light the three candles for this black tie affair\n\nI'm stargatin' while y'all are stargazin'\n\nHeart starts racin' like studyin' Carl Sagan\n\nStandin' in formation, chantin' the oration\n\nTell the mortals there will be no teleportation\n\nDeep and dark woods down the creepiest roads\n\nDifferent symbols letters and numbers you can see 'em decode\n\nIn the creepiest robes, bunch of people we loathe\n\nI don't fuck with the shit they do in that Bohemian Grove\n\n\n\nI'm from your ancient future\n\nLegend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff\n\nBurn emcees like degrees of Mason, 'cause you're fakin'\n\nLegend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff\n\nI'm from your ancient future\n\nLegend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff\n\nA Master Mason when I'm buildin' my pyramid\n\nLegend of the third degree god, Hiram Abiff"
