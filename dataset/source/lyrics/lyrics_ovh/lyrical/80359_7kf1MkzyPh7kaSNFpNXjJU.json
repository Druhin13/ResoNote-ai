  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Amnesiac par Kamelot\r\nSay my name\nNo beautyfying filters\nI'm craving that honest pain\nThese a perfect lines\nAre always out of place\nOnly you and I were born to break the chains\n\nCaught in the framework\nDying to belong\nEscape the wasteland\nDon't forget who you are\n\nAmnesiac\nDon't let the world revolve around you\nDon't wait another day\nTo re-erase your memory\n\nAmnesiac\nDon't let the dream dissolve without you\nThe more you know\nThe more they key hold you back\nAmnesiac\n\nMortal peace\nPushing through a needle\nObserving your every move\nA thousand lies\nTo avoid the question why\nCuz the more you know\nThe more they hold you back\n\nCaught in the framework\nDying to belong\nEscape the wasteland\nDon't forget who you are\n\n\nAmnesiac\nDon't let the world revolved around you\nDon't wait on another day\nTo re-erase your memory\nAmnesiac\nDon't let the dream dissolve without you\nThe more you know\nThe more they hold you back\nAmnesiac\n\nNo beautyfying filters\nBeyond the perfect lines\nThis effortless intrusion\nStop, erase, rewind"
