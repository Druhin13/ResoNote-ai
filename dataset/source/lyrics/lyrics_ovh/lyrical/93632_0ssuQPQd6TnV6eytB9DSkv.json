  "lyrics": "Do you still like white wine, white wine\r\nAt the right time, right time?\r\nLow lights\r\nDo you still hate my guts? Baby that's fine\r\nDo you still get blacked out too hard?\r\nWake up feeling too far from where your home really is\n\nDon't know what I did but I take it back, I was acting like a kid\n\n\n\nDo you still get up in yo head, acting like the world's gonna end?\n\nDo you still have that feeling no one's gonna love you for you?\n\nMaybe I'm just stuck in the past\n\nNothing good ever last\n\n\n\nWe used to drive all night, all night\n\nWe would feel good get high, now I wonder\n\nWhatever happened to you?\n\nMoved to the south side, south side\n\nMade friends with the girls that you don't like\n\nWhatever happened to you?\n\nWhatever happened to you?\n\n\n\nWhat happened to me?\n\nWish you were here\n\nNow I can see everything clear\n\nGone for a week, feels like a year\n\nI've been sending texts, you ain't read it\n\nI feel deleted, I feel defeated\n\nKinda feel cheated\n\nHow you gonna walk up out my life no reason\n\nRules are gonna break and mistakes gon' repeated\n\nBut I can't let you tell me that you love me and believe it\n\n\n\nDo you still get up in yo head, acting like the world's gonna end?\n\nDo you still have that feeling no one's gonna love you for you?\n\nMaybe I'm just stuck in the past\n\nNothing good ever last\n\n\n\nWe used to drive all night, all night\n\nWe would feel good get high, now I wonder\n\nWhatever happened to you?\n\nMoved to the south side, south side\n\nMade friends with the girls that you don't like\n\nWhatever happened to you?\n\nWhatever happened to you?\n\nWhatever happened to you?"
