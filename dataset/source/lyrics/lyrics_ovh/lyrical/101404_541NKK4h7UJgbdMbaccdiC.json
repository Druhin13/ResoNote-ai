  "lyrics": "You light my fire\r\nIgniting in my chest at your touch\r\nWhat I want to hear is your emotion\r\nWhatever will be, will be the waves\r\nThat lead this new age\r\nHow are you feeling now? It's emotion\n\n\n\nAs we face the world\n\nWe test our strong ties\n\nHand in hand together\n\nAre we ready to play fair?\n\n\n\nJust believe myself\n\nAnd like in my dreams\n\nThis world can't stop me\n\nI got this now, speed up, speed up\n\nJust believe myself\n\nThese long lonely nights\n\nCan't hold me down\n\nI see the future, speed up, speed up\n\nAnd now at last there is a purpose I have found\n\nNow that I believe in myself\n\n\n\nI want to draw a dream\n\nOne that won't disappear in the flesh\n\nTurning round and round, a burning passion\n\nWithout you, with you\n\nAs our two souls become one, I cry\n\nWhat is my life for without a mission?\n\n\n\nAs you're heading out\n\nI wish you good luck\n\n'Til we meet again\n\nSay you will live to tell the tale\n\n\n\nJust believe myself\n\nI'll burn this bright dream\n\nInto my memory\n\nTime can't stop me, speed up, speed up\n\nJust believe myself\n\nMy hand that you hold\n\nI'll never let go\n\nThe time is now, speed up, speed up\n\nAnd as this overflowing wish drifts far away\n\nI will just believe in myself\n\n\n\nJust believe myself\n\nAnd like in my dreams\n\nThe world can't stop me\n\nI got this now, speed up, speed up\n\nJust believe myself\n\nThese long lonely nights\n\nCan't hold me down\n\nI see the future, speed up, speed up\n\nAnd now at last there is a purpose I have found\n\nNow that I believe in myself"
