  "lyrics": "Little Ricky had a crucifix\r\nWhen he was just a kid\r\nHe bought it at the eagle's nest\r\nWhere Adolf Hitler hid\r\nThere were angels and demons\r\nCrawling all over that thing\n\nIt had a little fence around it\n\nAnd roof all made of wood\n\nAnd sometimes he'd pray to it\n\nWhen he was feeling good\n\nBut when life went against him\n\nAnd his little world turned to shit\n\nHe'd take that crucifix and\n\nPlay God for a little bit\n\nBut God don't care\n\n\n\nNo, God don't care\n\nAbout you\n\n\n\nSometimes you get a clue\n\nAnd baby, it's true\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nThere's nothing you can do\n\nWhen I beat you black and blue\n\nGod don't care about you\n\n\n\nI see it in the faces\n\nOf the children in the zone\n\nLoud bombs keep fallin'\n\nRockets from a drone\n\nThere's no where to run\n\nNo shelter\n\nNot even under mama's wing\n\nListening to the cries and pain\n\nYou'd think the world was cursed\n\nBut the oligarchs are running things\n\nAnd they put their interests first\n\nNone of them really care\n\nHow many people burn\n\nAs long as the money that they spend\n\nStill gets a good return\n\nAnd God don't care\n\nGod don't care about them\n\n\n\nIt's the same mean hymn\n\nNo, God don't care about them\n\nI saw it in ancient Egypt\n\nThen again in Bethlehem\n\nGod don't care about them\n\n\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nThere's nothing you can say or do\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nI know you know it's true\n\nBut I still do\n\nGod don't care about you\n\n\n\nI got a rocket in my pocket\n\nFor the whole damn human race\n\nWhile God keeps his distance\n\nWearing that same ol' poker face\n\nI got some bad early press\n\nThey called me \"The Man Who Would be King\"\n\nBut nothing's further from the truth\n\nI don't think you understand\n\nI don't need to lift a finger\n\nTo further decimate this land\n\nY'all are doin' fine without me\n\nGo on torch your neighborhood\n\nThen come on down to my house\n\nYou know I'll make it good\n\nCause God don't care\n\nGod don't care about you\n\n\n\nYou lit that fuse\n\nAnd led the shake down cruise\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nI know you know it's true\n\nBut I still do\n\nGod don't care about you\n\n\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nThere's nothing you can say or do\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nI know you know it's true\n\nBut I still do\n\nGod don't care about you\n\n\n\nHe dropped out of the blue\n\nBid you all adieu\n\nGod don't care about you\n\nAin't nothing you can do\n\nJust slide on through\n\nGod don't care about you"
