That's all that's left with you when you die\n\n\n\n words won't do anything\n\nI won't feel anything\n\n... That's all that's left with you when you die\n\n\n\nGo fuck yourself\n\nI'm mean not nice\n\nYou said it twice\n\nYou said it twice\n\nDon't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?\n\nI've got some work to do\n\nI'm gonna eat your heart out\n\nI heard you the first time"
