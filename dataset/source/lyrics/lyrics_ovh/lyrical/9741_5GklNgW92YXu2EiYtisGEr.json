  "lyrics": "All the maps of the world have been drawn\r\nThere's nothing to explore except your face\r\nI keep getting older\r\nBut my heart stays the same age\r\nI'd never want to live forever\r\nCause I'd have to watch everyone die\n\nDeath is what makes this whole life\n\nMeaningful, it's what keeps me alive\n\n\n\nI'm scared to death that I\n\nWill never make it out alive\n\nAnd I'll be stuck in this mess forever\n\n\n\nThe older that I get the more I find\n\nThat each moment is a gift in time\n\nThe first time we saw Saves the Day\n\nYou never made it home, you spent the night with me\n\nWhen I was young it was a mystery\n\nIt took me years but now I finally see\n\nWhat it is that you meant to me\n\n\"Stay What You Are\" will always be our eulogy\n\n\n\nWhen it rains in LA people lose their shit\n\nJust like I lost my mind in 2006\n\nThat anxious boy has been\n\nBuried in a shallow ditch\n\nOne day when I'm rotting in my grave\n\nI'll look back on my life and I will say\n\n\"Why the hell did it take me so long\n\nTo back that bottle off of my lips?\"\n\n\n\nAm I wasting all my time\n\nTrying hard to find the line\n\nBetween holding on and letting go?\n\n\n\nThe older that I get the more I find\n\nThat each moment is a gift in time\n\nThe first time we saw Saves The Day\n\nYou never made it home, you spent the night with me\n\nWhen I was young it was a mystery\n\nIt took me years but now I finally see\n\nWhat it is that you meant to me\n\n\"Stay What You Are\" will always be our eulogy\n\n\n\nI remember when you whispered in my ear\n\n\"Do not fear when I am gone I'll be right here\"\n\nWhen all the world is wasting away\n\nI'll hold my heart and say your name\n\n\n\nThe older that I get the more I find\n\nThat each moment is a gift in time\n\nThe first time we saw Saves The Day\n\nYou never made it home, you spent the night with me\n\nWhen I was young it was a mystery\n\nIt took me years but now I finally see\n\nWhat it is that you meant to me\n\n\"Stay What You Are\" will always be our eulogy\n\n\n\nAm I wasting all my time\n\nTrying hard to find the line\n\nBetween holding on and letting go?"
