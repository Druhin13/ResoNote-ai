  "lyrics": "I remember cold dark nights\r\nStaring at a moonlit sky\r\nWalking circles in the same place\r\nTrying to ease my cold dark mind\r\nQuestions have been endless here\r\nNot an answer for miles\n\nOut of the horizon line\n\nAn explosion of light\n\n\n\nI've been terrified for all of my life\n\nBeen losing the fight\n\nI'm terrified\n\nI was falling apart til you made it right\n\nI wasted my days in the lowlife\n\nTil you turned all my dark into daylight\n\nI was terrified\n\nAfter all of this time\n\nYou lifted me up from the lowlife\n\n\n\nI can see you standing there\n\nOh if I could just reach out\n\nYou know that I've been so afraid\n\nAfraid that I would pull you down\n\nI ruin everything that's perfect\n\nI'm hiding the best of me\n\nYou're all I need\n\nTo me you are perfect\n\nYou bring out the best in me\n\n\n\nI've been terrified for all of my life\n\nBeen losing the fight\n\nI'm terrified\n\nI was falling apart til you made it right\n\nI wasted my days in the lowlife\n\nTil you turned all my dark into daylight\n\nOh I was terrified\n\nAfter all of this time\n\nYou lifted me up from the lowlife\n\n\n\nLost without you\n\nLost without you\n\nLost without you\n\nLost without you\n\nLost without you\n\n\n\n\n\nI was terrified for all of my life\n\nBeen losing the fight\n\nI'm terrified\n\nI was falling apart til you made it right\n\nI wasted my days in the lowlife\n\nTil you turned all my dark into daylight\n\nOh I was terrified\n\nAfter all of this time\n\nYou lifted me up from the lowlife"
