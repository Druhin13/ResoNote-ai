  "lyrics": "Raised under rays of gold\r\nAnd under sapphire skies\r\nOut in the sandy loam\r\nI found a way to make you cry\r\nHow can a child of the sun be so cold?\n\nUp past the Seven Falls\n\nBeyond the moody peak\n\nI dove into the lake and called\n\nAn icy command for you to join me\n\nHow can a child of the sun be so cold?\n\n\n\nSo cold\n\nLike a planet with no sun floats in the black\n\nI’m old now\n\nAnd I try to be kind but still sometimes\n\nI’m as cold as that\n\n\n\nCatamount, Ivywild\n\nMany moons I've roamed\n\nDusty trails of summer\n\nAnd my heart consumed with snow\n\nHow can a child of the sun be so cold?\n\n\n\nSo cold\n\nLike a caveman they found on the frozen flats\n\nI’m old now\n\nAnd I try to be kind but still sometimes\n\nI’m as cold as that"
