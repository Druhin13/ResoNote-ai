  "lyrics": "Underneath electric light\r\nStrangers standing side by side\r\nAt the dawn of the day, we're ships in the night\r\nCan we look each other in the eye\r\nOh, ultraviolet\n\nI'll hold you to the light\n\nCause I know that you're right\n\nI'm not taking a side\n\nBut tonight\n\n\n\nPull at the sutures and pieces\n\nThat keep us from seeing through\n\nAll of the fog and the fear\n\nFalling between me and you\n\n[?] burning blue\n\nPiercing the fog and the fear\n\nStuck in between me and you\n\n\n\nLights are up and the walls come down\n\nWill you tell me where do we go now\n\nCan we take a circle, make a sphere\n\n[?] that hold us here\n\n\n\nOh, ultraviolet\n\nI'll hold you to the light\n\nCause I know that you're right\n\nI'm not taking a side\n\nBut tonight\n\n\n\nPull at the sutures and pieces\n\nThat keep us from seeing through\n\nAll of the fog and the fear\n\nFalling between me and you\n\n[?] burning blue\n\nPiercing the fog and the fear\n\nStuck in between me and you\n\n\n\nAll that keeps us so divided\n\nUnder control, steady [?]\n\nCaught up in a vicious cycle\n\nI don't need\n\n\n\nPull at the sutures and pieces\n\nThat keep us from seeing through\n\nAll of the fog and the fear\n\nFalling between me and you\n\n[?] burning blue\n\nPiercing the fog and the fear\n\nStuck in between me and you"
