  "lyrics": "Every night, every day\r\nTen times outta nine, I'm a hand grenade\r\nI don’t wanna push you away, but I'm warning you, babe\r\nInstead of green light, no serenade\r\nIt's a red flag before the mayday\r\nCheck all of my signs, keep away, I’m warning you, babe\n\n\n\nAfraid to light the fuse again; start a fire, lose a friend\n\nBut when your heart opens it's like I'm ready to fall again\n\n\n\nWho tripped the red wire out of the blue?\n\nSwept off my feet, said, \"God save me now\"\n\nHow many people there in a dark room?\n\nSwept off my feet, said, \"God save me now\"\n\n\n\nIs it real love? Is it real love?\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\nI can feel your, I can feel your heart\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\n\n\nHeads up, look alive\n\nThe more that I stare into your eyes\n\nThe more I get lost in your face; I'm warning you, babe\n\nA red line, danger zone\n\nPoint of no return coming real close\n\nPulling me in, I'm afraid, I'm warning you, babe\n\n\n\nAfraid to light the fuse again; start a fire, lose a friend\n\nBut when your heart opens it's like I'm ready to fall again\n\n\n\nWho tripped the red wire out of the blue?\n\nSwept off my feet, said, \"God save me now\"\n\nHow many people there in a dark room?\n\nSwept off my feet, said, \"God save me now\"\n\n\n\nIs it real love? Is it real love?\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\nI can feel your, I can feel your heart\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\n\n\nAfraid to light the fuse again; start a fire, lose a friend\n\nBut when your heart opens it’s like I’m ready to fall again\n\n\n\nWho tripped the red wire out of the blue?\n\nSwept off my feet, said, \"God save me now\"\n\nHow many people there in a dark room?\n\nSwept off my feet, said, \"God save me now\"\n\n\n\nIs it real love? Is it real love?\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\nI can feel your, I can feel your heart\n\nTi-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\nI can feel your heart ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb\n\nI can feel your heart ti-ti-ti-ticking like a time-bomb"
