  "lyrics": "We ain't been alone since the day\r\nWe met\r\nAnd we can't keep our hands to ourselves\r\nIt's almost wrong how we get\r\nOoh, something about you\n\nSomething about me\n\nSomething about us\n\nWell some folks think that you can't fall this hard\n\nBut these are our hearts\n\n\n\nI knew it in the car that night when you looked left and I looked right\n\nAnd we both grinned\n\nStayed out a little longer, found the fire a little stronger\n\nThan we ever planned\n\n\n\nAnd ooh, I got your number\n\nI saw the lightning\n\nFelt the thunder\n\nAnd we gave this thing one hell of a start\n\nYeah these are our hearts\n\nThese are our hearts\n\n\n\nOoh, something about you\n\nSomething about me\n\nSomething about us\n\nWe didn't know that we could fall this hard\n\nBut we gave this thing one hell of a start\n\nPicked up each other's pieces and parts\n\nAnd said \"Hey baby, these are our hearts\"\n\nYeah these are our hearts"
