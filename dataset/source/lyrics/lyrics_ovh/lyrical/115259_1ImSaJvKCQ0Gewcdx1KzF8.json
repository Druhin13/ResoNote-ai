  "lyrics": "Saw your face through the crowd\r\nPlaying with your hair looking down\r\nHoping no one is around that knows you\r\nOr how you're feeling\r\nSaw your heart on your sleeve\r\nYou say it's only for me\n\nIt's spreading like a disease\n\nYou're overcome, but\n\n\n\nI can't love you\n\nLike you're loving me\n\nNow you've got me\n\nBruised and broken\n\nYou're a part of me\n\nNow you've got me\n\n\n\n\n\nI can learn to lose you\n\nToying with our used youth\n\nI can learn to lose you\n\nToying with our used youth\n\n\n\nShield your face from the light\n\nLay awake through the night\n\nHoping maybe I might\n\nFeel the same way in the morning\n\nCounting down the days\n\nNo, it won't go away\n\nFeel the ever decay of who you are, but\n\n\n\nI can't love you\n\nLike you're loving me\n\nNow you've got me\n\nBruised and broken\n\nYou're a part of me\n\nNow you've got me\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't love you\n\nLike you're loving me\n\nNow you've got me\n\nBruised and broken\n\nYou're a part of me\n\n\n\nI can learn to lose you\n\nToying with our used youth\n\nI can learn to lose you\n\nToying with our used youth"
