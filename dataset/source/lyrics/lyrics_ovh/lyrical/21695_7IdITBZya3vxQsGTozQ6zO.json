  "lyrics": "Lately, I’ve been losing sleep, haunted by design\r\nI’m my own worst enemy when I try to close my eyes\r\nVoices in my weary head, they never let me be\r\nTurning every fear and dread from a whisper to a scream\r\nI keep searching, I can’t find\n\nAny kind of respite from the noise inside\n\nThe clock is laughing, don’t ask me why\n\nIn the halls of my mind\n\nI’m still haunted by design\n\nHaunted by design\n\n\n\nRestless scenes and fever dreams, they’re never giving way\n\nWhen I should be counting sheep, I’m counting my last days\n\nSoon the morning sun will rise to overtake the moon\n\nLike the ghost of death arrived and took my love too soon\n\n\n\nI keep searching, I can’t find\n\nAny kind of respite from the noise inside\n\nThe clock is laughing, don’t ask me why\n\nIn the halls of my mind\n\nI’m still haunted by design\n\nHaunted by design\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who worry suffer twice, this I must concede\n\nI think it’s time to close my eyes, slumber rescue me, yeah\n\n\n\nI keep searching, I can’t find\n\nAny kind of respite from the noise inside\n\nThe clock is laughing, don’t ask me why\n\nIn the halls of my mind\n\nI’m still haunted by design\n\nHaunted by design\n\nI’m haunted by design\n\nHaunted by design"
