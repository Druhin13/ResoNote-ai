  "lyrics": "These motherfuckers can feel that the storms coming\r\nI’ve been broke to the point where I couldn’t afford to hustle\r\nIf you listen to my music then your welcome to join the struggle\r\nI still go the weight of the whole world on my shoulders\r\nI’m building muscle!\n\nCome take a look in my eyes and you Can see the ambition\n\nI’m feeling a prison, it’s obvious to see that you don’t get it\n\nI think it’s time for you to really start reading my lyrics\n\nAnd the. You can see that I’m a whole different breed and appearance!\n\n\n\nI don’t need a reason to kill it I just do it\n\nIf opportunity knocks at my door then I’ll run through it\n\nThis a whole Nother level of hustle so fuck you\n\nIf you don’t play this alone at night getting drunk to it!\n\n\n\nGottaConquer And devide and put your heart on the line\n\nI’ll never work a 9-5 bitch I want what is mine\n\nAnd that’s the difference I’ll never be a slave to the system\n\nAnd your not balling dawg your momma had to pay your tuition\n\nI’m throwing Molotov’s at all of y’all while I play my position,,\n\nI’ll put this blade to your face untill my name is imprinted\n\nIt cuts deep you should probably give the surgeon a call\n\nCause every word and every bar now leaves a permanent scar\n\nI’m back off Haiatus, I’m outta school like miles davis\n\nI told my fam to stick around I promise you I’m gonna make it\n\nNow it’s been a long time since I felt calm and collected\n\nAnd to be honest it’s been fucking with my confidence levels\n\nWhen I was young I was convinced that I am the dev\n\nBut now the devil is my bitch wearing five and stilettos\n\nPut in work so long it feels like I need a medal\n\nI got these rappers on my strings it feels like I am jhepetto"
