  "lyrics": "Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find\r\nI tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind\r\nWhatever happened to our love? I wish I understood\r\nIt used to be so nice, it used to be so good\r\nSo when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S\n\nThe love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S\n\nWhen you're gone, how can I even try to go on?\n\nWhen you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?\n\n\n\nYou seem so far away, though you are standing near\n\nYou made me feel alive, but something died, I fear\n\nI really tried to make it out, I wish I understood\n\nWhat happened to our love - it used to be so good\n\n\n\nSo when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S\n\nThe love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S\n\nWhen you're gone, how can I even try to go on?\n\nWhen you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?\n\n\n\nSo when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S\n\nThe love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S\n\nWhen you're gone, how can I even try to go on?\n\nWhen you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?\n\n\n\nWhen you're gone, how can I even try to go on?\n\nWhen you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?"
