  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Proud and the Broken par Kamelot\r\nWhere have all the heroes gone\nThat used to bleed for us\nStill holding on to fading lullabies\nAnd fear the end when every note is lost\n\nHow can we know\nIf a glance beyond the shadow wall\nCould free our souls\n\nIn the wake behind the virtuous we carry on\nWhile listening to the poetry of lies\nAnd darkened by the prosperous we carry on\nAs ignorance of human life subsides\n\nThey left us behind and broke our pride\nThey told us to be brave\n\nBut like an insect drawn to light\nWe circle around the radiance of truth\n\nHow can we know\nIf a glance beyond the shadow wall\nCould free our souls?\n\nIn the wake behind the virtuous we carry on\nWhile listening to the poetry of lies\nAnd darkened by the prosperous we carry on\nAs ignorance of human life subsides\n\nI am you\nYou are me\nFeel the grace\nI set you free\nI am the empire\n\n\n(The Broken:)\n\nI am learning to crawl\nDenying the fall\nIn time I'll stand again\n\nI am bare to the skin\nI'm refusing to give in\nYou can't break my heart again\n\nBut I try\nI keep trying\nAnd I dying to forgive\nAll the matters is what's going to be\n\nI try\nI keep trying\nI am dying to forgive\n\nI am you\nYou are me\n\nIn the wake behind the virtuous we carry on\nWhile listening to the poetry of lies\nAnd darkened by the prosperous we carry on\nAs ignorance of human life subsides"
