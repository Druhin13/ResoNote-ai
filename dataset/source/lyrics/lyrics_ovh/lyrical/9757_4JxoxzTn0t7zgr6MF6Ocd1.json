  "lyrics": "Take a minute for a moment\r\nAre you always so preoccupied\r\nHave you ever really noticed\r\nThat you’re never really there when you arrive\r\nI’ve been told a thing or two\n\nI didn’t want to hear but I guess\n\nI needed someone like you\n\n\n\nAnd I really shouldn’t have to explain it\n\nWhy this train of thought is dangerous\n\n\n\nHas anybody ever told you\n\nThat you're never like you're advertised\n\nSo you’re never really lonely\n\nIt’s just a feeling you can change your mind\n\n\n\nAnd I know that this is true\n\nNobody really owns the truth like you do\n\nAnd i really shouldn’t have to say this\n\nBut someday this song may change for us"
