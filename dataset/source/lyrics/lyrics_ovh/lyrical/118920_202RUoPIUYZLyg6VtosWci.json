Damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib, doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff. Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together, I was tryna make sense-sense of all this shit around me, I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean. And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit, but I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house, and just, so much going on. And I'm sure everybody was probably like, damn, yo\n\n\n\n\"Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?\"\n\nOn the real, I was doin' anything to run away\n\nAnd that's the same reason kids join gangs every day\n\n'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected\n\nMeanwhile, white america quick to call him a thug\n\nBut all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love\n\nTell him that he love him, that he need him\n\nPromise he won't ever leave him\n\nNever smoke crack, never lie, and he'll never beat him\n\nI feel like all my life I been needing a break\n\nLooking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake\n\nAnd I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great\n\nOh God please, can I have a conversation with 'em?\n\nMember of my family without they hand out asking for five G's\n\nTo pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh)\n\nI learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime\n\nI'll give you something worth more, that's my time\n\nI ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge\n\nUnless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college\n\nAnd hit me on the phone, hit me up\n\nLike \"Uncle Bob, where you at?\n\nYeah I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that\n\nI'm glad we family\" (uh)\n\nWe a half breed family, yeah, yeah, uh\n\n\n\nMan see I remember when I was like fifteen years old and my dad took me to the studio--I know this is random I'm just trying to take you guys through it, right. And, I'll never forget it I had like eight rhyme books--he'll tell you, he'll tell you man, I just, I went through them motherfuckers I was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight. And that was my first time yo, I was like tenth grade, in the studio, and I knew that this was what I wanted to do. I knew it\n\n\n\nI knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill\n\nI been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spill\n\nNone other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack\n\nAnd then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that\n\nAnd then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, there ain't no turning back\n\nCouldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that\n\nSee I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain\n\nBut I'ma to take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane\n\n\n\nI was in College Park, right. Well I guess technically, if you wanna go before that, I was uh, I was living in Germantown, uh no actually it was in Montgomery Village, back in Maryland I was living in my sister's basement. And some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out, it was Christmas, whatever I love you Genie. Anyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing. You know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know, I went, uh, I stayed at my mentor's house, Solomon, and I stayed back at my Godparent's house, Mary Jo and Bernie, I love ya'll. Uh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry back when I used to smoke, I would steal the shit out of your cigarettes, I love you, I'm sorry about that. But, you remember, always you would let me record, I'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could so, I love you, I thank you for supporting me there. But then, she was like, \"you gotta get the fuck outta here\" too, after a while, she gave me some time, but like, I was twenty years old at this point. She was like, \"nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life.\" And this was right around the time I opened my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man, in Gaithersburg, right in Old Town, the shit was insane, I'll never forget it, and that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup! That's right man, we just started kicking it and hanging, he lived in College park and before I, before I knew it I was living with him in his basement. And this is right around the time I met 6ix, and 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which is right down the street. So I'd always go to their dorm room, I remember there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was making beats. We was doing all types of shit man, when we first got out we did the first Young Sinatra, and now we on the fourth Young Sinatra motherfucker that shit is crazy man. And I remember like, I used to steal quarters from Lenny just so I could go to the 7-11 to eat and he was like, \"you idiot why are you stealing, just ask me bro,\" and I was supposed to get a job, I was sleeping in, uh, his basement on the couch, which is the cover to my first album, Under Pressure, shout out Cathy, shout out the Rosado family, all my beautiful brown people! We made it, it's crazy, but nah nah, listen, I'm getting ahead of myself, I'm getting ahead of myself. So like, I was staying with him and I was supposed to get a job, right? And he was like, \"Yo, you gotta get a fucking job bro.\" Things were going so good with the music that we kinda stopped talking about it, it seemed like every week something new was happening, and I just sat him down one day and I was like, \"Look bro, please, like, can you just give me one year, like just give me one year, man, let me put everything into that year. And if I don't get it, fuck it, I'll just submit, and I'll just blend into society.\" And he was like, \"Bro I'ma give you one year,\" and for one year him, his family, all his homies, Benny, everybody man! They took care of me, they put, he put clothes on my back, he put food in my stomach, you know he helped me with microphones, and recording, and yo, almost a year to the fucking day bro, I signed to Def Jam. And my man, he was a land surveyor, out there making sure all the buildings get built, rain, snow, sleet, all that shit for twelve years dawg! And when I signed my deal I said, \"Fuck that! Quit your job, we're moving to LA!\" That shit was crazy, so we get to LA, we're staying off Coldwater Canyon. Alta Mesa, in studio city man, and I'm going to the studio with No I.D. every day, and like, shit is crazy. That's the first time I met Cole, yo shout out Cole, that's my fucking boy. Big Sean, all these homies man that I met, it was crazy, Don Cannon, everybody. That's when I first met Kev, Bobby my engineer, what up Bobby? It was just like, life was insane. I dropped Young Sinatra Undeniable, and that was crazy, that was insane, 'cause that was the first time\n\n\n\nMe and my boys ever hit the road\n\nOn the real you know we went from zero to overload\n\nPerforming in front of the fans, they had their hands waving\n\nThis is all I ever wanted, this is all I'm craving\n\nMe and my boy Chris shot the game\n\nTwo visionaries on a mission, shit ain't been the same\n\nSome ups and downs came around, had a lot of problems\n\nBut no matter what happened you know we always solve 'em\n\nWe always solve 'em, like\n\n\n\nMan, it's kinda crazy thinking about it though. Like so much has happened yo, and I mean shit, by the time y'all are hearing this, I'm 28, I'm 27 while I'm recording it. I mean right now literally I'm working on Bobby Tarantino, Ultra 85, Young Sinatra 4, and a whole bunch of other shit, man this is crazy! Acting, writing, like I'm just so, I can't believe I'm here man, we grinded for so long, we worked for so long, yo. And motherfuckers they hate you man, they try to make me feel bad about how I look, how I speak, how I rap, how I act, my race, my everything, they just, they fucking hate you man, they'll hate you when you in this position. But you can't let 'em, you can't let 'em, you can't let that shit get to you man. Continue to persevere, continue to be the best you you can be, 'cause I'm here right now man, best friends. I got everything I could ever want man, even though you always want more deep down, and you got goals deep down, that's great, but fuck that shit, I'm so happy, I'm so blessed man. So if you listening to this right now, no matter how old you are, how young you are, whether you on a school bus headed to get your education, or you driving home from work pissed off at your boss, just man, just please do what you love in life. So many people, they always say, \"Oh I would do this but,\" or \"I can't because,\" and you already fucking lost, they lost, and I felt bad for that person 'cause that person will never make it. \"I would, but I don't have the money,\" \"I would, but I don't have the time,\" Fuck that, you gotta do it man, you gotta do what makes you happy, you have to live selfishly in that aspect. Stop worrying about others, stop freaking out, just focus on yourself man, and your own happiness, that's the realest thing. And that's all I can tell you, because you can't help anyone else until you help yourself, you know what I'm saying. So please, put the mask on first, like they say on the airplane, cus', put your own motherfucking mask on, and go do it man. Go do it, just live your life\n\n\n\nI love y'all, thank you so much for tuning in, uh, I hope you've enjoyed this Young Sinatra experience, I know I have. Uh, this is prolly gon' be the last one tho, uh, this gon' be the last one for sure. I'm coming back with some fun, but, I don't know. I love you guys! Ultra 85's gonna be crazy! I mean crazy!
