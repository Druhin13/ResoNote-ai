  "lyrics": "You call me out upon the waters\r\nThe great unknown where feet may fail\r\nAnd there I find You in the mystery\r\nIn oceans deep\r\nMy faith will stand\n\nAnd I will call upon Your name\n\nAnd keep my eyes above the waves\n\nWhen oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace\n\nFor I am Yours and You are mine\n\nYour grace abounds in deepest waters\n\nYour sovereign hand\n\nWill be my guide\n\nWhere feet may fail and fear surrounds me\n\nYou've never failed and You won't start now\n\nAs Your love, in wave after wave\n\nCrashes over me, crashes over me\n\nFor You are for us\n\nYou are not against us\n\nChampion of Heaven\n\nYou made a way for all to enter in\n\nSpirit lead me where my trust is without borders\n\nLet me walk upon the waters\n\nWherever You would call me\n\nTake me deeper than my feet could ever wander\n\nAnd my faith will be made stronger in the presence my Saviour (You make me brave)\n\nSpirit lead me where my trust is without borders (You make me brave)\n\nYou call me out beyond the shore into the waves\n\nYou make me brave\n\nYou make me brave\n\nNo fear can hinder now the promises You made\n\nMy soul will rest in Your embrace for I am Yours and You are mine"
