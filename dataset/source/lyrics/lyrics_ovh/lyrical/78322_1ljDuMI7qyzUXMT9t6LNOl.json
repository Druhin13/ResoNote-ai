  "lyrics": "There was a time when men were kind\r\nWhen their voices were soft\r\nAnd their words inviting\r\nThere was a time when love was blind\r\nAnd the world was a song\n\nAnd the song was exciting\n\n\n\nThere was a time\n\nThen it all went wrong\n\n\n\nI dreamed a dream in time gone by\n\nWhen hope was high and life worth living\n\nI dreamed that love would never die\n\nI dreamed that God would be forgiving\n\n\n\nThen I was young and unafraid\n\nAnd dreams were made and used and wasted\n\nThere was no ransom to be paid\n\nNo song unsung, no wine untasted\n\n\n\nBut the tigers come at night\n\nWith their voices soft as thunder\n\nAs they tear your hope apart\n\nAs they turn your dream to shame\n\n\n\nHe slept a summer by my side\n\nHe filled my days with endless wonder\n\nHe took my childhood in his stride\n\nBut he was gone when autumn came\n\n\n\nAnd still I dream he'll come to me\n\nThat we will live the years together\n\nBut there are dreams that cannot be\n\nAnd there are storms we cannot weather\n\n\n\nI had a dream my life would be\n\nSo different from this hell I'm living\n\nSo different now from what it seemed\n\nNow life has killed the dream I dreamed"
