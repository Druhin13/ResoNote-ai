  "lyrics": "I guess you never knew, \nDear boy, what you had found, \nI guess you never knew, \nDear boy, that she was just the cutest thing around. \nI guess you never knew what you had found, \nDear boy. \n\n\n\nI guess you never saw, \n\nDear boy, that love was there, \n\nAnd maybe when you look too hard, \n\nDear boy, you never do become aware. \n\nI guess you never did become aware, \n\nDear boy. \n\n\n\nWhen I stepped in, my heart was down and out, \n\nBut her love came through and brought me 'round, \n\nGot me up and about. \n\n\n\nWhen I stepped in, my heart was down and out, \n\nBut her love came through and brought me 'round, \n\nGot me up and about. \n\n\n\nI hope you never know, dear boy, \n\nHow much you missed, \n\nAnd even when you fall in love, \n\nDear boy, it won't be half as good as this \n\nI hope you never know how much you missed, dear boy. \n\n\n\nI stepped in, my heart was down and out, \n\nBut her love came through and brought me 'round, \n\nGot me up and about. \n\nDear boy, how much you missed, \n\nDear boy."
