  "lyrics": "Why look so awfully tragic?Put on a happy faceSmiling can work like magicPut on a happy faceTake off that gloomy mask of tragedy, It's not your styleYou'll look so goo\u0000dthat you'll be gladYou decided to smilePick out a pleasant outlookStick out that noble chinWipe off that full of doubt lookSlap on a happy grinAnd spread sunshine all over the place Just, put on a happy faceGray skies are gonna to clear upPut on a happy faceBrush off the clouds and cheer upPut on a happy faceWhy do you mope around so sourly,It's such a strainI always try to chuckle outwardly,It clears the brain.I knew a girl so gloomyShe'd never laugh or singShe wouldn't listen to meNow she's a mean ol' thingSo spread sunshine all over the place Just, put on a happy face"
