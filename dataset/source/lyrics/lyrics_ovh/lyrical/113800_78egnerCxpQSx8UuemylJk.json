  "lyrics": "My gal, she don't need no diamond rings\r\nShe don't need to get advice from fashion magazines\r\nMy gal, she don't need my fame, now let me make that clear\r\nDoesn't want to hear \"I love you\" whispered in her ear\r\nOnly one thing that she needs\n\nAnd it's right between my legs\n\n\n\nMy gal's addicted to my cock\n\nOnce she gets started, I'll tell ya, she can't stop\n\nShe's addicted, she's like a fiend\n\nWhen we start fucking, can't get enough of me\n\nShe's addicted, she's addicted\n\nShe's addicted to my dick, yeah\n\n\n\nMy gal, she just wants to bond\n\nShe skips after-parties, wants me to take her home\n\n\n\nOnly one thing that she needs\n\nAnd it's right between my legs\n\n\n\nMy gal's addicted to my cock\n\nOnce she gets started, I'll tell ya, she can't stop\n\nShe's addicted, she's like a fiend\n\nWhen we start fucking, can't get enough of me\n\nShe's addicted, she's addicted\n\nShe's addicted to my dick, yeah\n\n\n\nIt's like there's a piece of crack rock stuck inside of my dick\n\nShe just might start crying if my gal don't get her fix\n\nMaybe she's an alcoholic and I am her booze\n\nBut I always give it to her - maybe I'm addicted too\n\n\n\nMy gal's addicted to my cock\n\nOnce she gets started, I'll tell ya, she can't stop\n\nShe's addicted, she's like a fiend\n\nOnce we start fucking, can't get enough of me\n\nShe's addicted, she's addicted\n\nShe's addicted to my dick, yeah\n\n\n\nA-dicc-ted, get it?\n\nGo on, get it\n\nI don't want a clean one, girl, I want a dirty one"
