  "lyrics": "All my mistakes don't make me less of a man\r\nBut lately I feel like them shits really can\r\nI'm praying I don't wake up all alone\r\nIt's hard to say it, so I write a song\r\nBut that ain't equal to me, right and wrong\r\nStuck between a rock and a hard place\n\nAnd I'ma had to figure is that a hard way\n\nWe may not even done our best terms\n\nMaybe we should love or we should learn\n\n\n\nI don't wanna fight with being wrong\n\nBut you, but you\n\nGot around the same things\n\nI don't wanna fight with being wrong, no, no\n\nBut you, but you\n\nGot around the same things\n\n\n\nSo if you ever fall\n\nYou know that I'll be there\n\nI know how to put my ego aside, yeah\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong\n\nYou said you never wanna share\n\nBut now I'm stuck between\n\nWhat I love and who I love\n\nI know it's unfair"
