  "lyrics": "I got some money, I'mma blow it all today\r\nThey say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'\r\nAnd my reply was 'There's more on the way'\r\nWhen I said it, I was walking in the rain\r\nI did a show in Chicago on the first\n\nNow I'm back in LA like Chicago and First\n\nNo sun but I fathered this verse\n\nThat's all I'm probably worth\n\nAnd I'm from sunny CA to reign on all of this earth\n\nRainy terrain, receive the God sent messages\n\nWe know the answer, but dance around what the question is\n\n(What is it?) It's back to who's on first\n\nIt's my dog\n\nIt's his tail\n\nIt's the chase\n\nIt's the search\n\nIt's the ignorance that causes all the bliss in my surroundings\n\nCause dealing with reality's like drawing out your boundaries\n\nAnd I refuse to be referred as less than a creative\n\nSo catch me when I'm live in town as I've been demonstrating\n\nThat I could find my greatness in the waking of my absence\n\nAnd absolutely kill it when they're dealing out these bad hands\n\nA player plays what a player's dealt\n\nAnd carries baggage like conveyor belts\n\nAnd never fucking saves his wealth\n\n\n\nI got some money, I'mma blow it all today\n\nThey say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'\n\nAnd my reply was 'There's more on the way'\n\nWhen I said it, I was walking in the rain\n\n\n\nI write to Alchemist 'cause others don't inspire me\n\nI got my people and they got my back entirely\n\nI kill with Iriscience on the side of me\n\nBy myself, I lay 'em out and iron out the irony (Flat)\n\nWhat a long winding road it's been\n\nWith no sign of slowing up around its turns and bends\n\nHow many have friends that ain't foes within?\n\nDirty laundry in the wash, but them clothes don't spin\n\nI mean, really, I kill two birds with one bullet\n\nThe target's when I line it up, the trigger's when I pull it\n\nOut the gate, a bit late, but the champ is back\n\nI need a third hand to wear my rings and hold plaques\n\nI hit the track like the run is new\n\nHands high like a stick-up, Killer Michael running jewels\n\nIt's true, the eyes slanted, my fam rock the planet\n\nDon't take fans for granted like the money is due\n\n\n\nGot some money, I'mma blow it all today\n\nThey say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'\n\nAnd my reply was 'There's more on the way'\n\nWhen I said it, I was walking in the rain\n\n(What is it?)\n\nGot some money, I'mma blow it all today\n\nThey say 'Michael, don't throw it all away'\n\nAnd my reply was 'There's more on the way'\n\nWhen I said it, I was walking in the rain"
