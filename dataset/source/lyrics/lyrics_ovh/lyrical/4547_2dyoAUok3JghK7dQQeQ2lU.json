  "lyrics": "Like a cobra they will strike\r\nAnd like lions caged we'll fight\r\nWe were taken not by choice\r\nThey put anger in our voice\r\nWe were fearless but so afraid\n\nThough in our hearts we still felt pain\n\nWe're on fire but on a leash\n\nWe only ever wanted peace\n\n\n\nNever the heroes, we were made to fight\n\nNever the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war\n\n\n\nLike a demon leads the youth\n\nWe are terrible in truth\n\nNo time to falter, no turning back\n\nWhen we come under attack\n\n\n\nThere is no question as with a friend\n\nWe have our honour to defend\n\nWe're on fire but on a leash\n\nWe only ever wanted peace\n\n\n\nNever the heroes, we were made to fight\n\nNever the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war\n\nAt war\n\n\n\nWe are together till the end\n\nWe have our honour to defend\n\n\n\nNever the heroes, we were made to fight\n\nNever the heroes, we were just sacrificed\n\nNever the heroes (We were never the heroes)\n\nWe were made to fight (We were made to fight)\n\nNever the heroes, we were sacrificed at war"
