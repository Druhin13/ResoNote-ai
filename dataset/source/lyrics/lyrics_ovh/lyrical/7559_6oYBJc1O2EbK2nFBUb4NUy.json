  "lyrics": "My past embraced\r\nMy sin forgiven\r\nI'm blameless in your sight\r\nMy history rewritten\r\n'Cause you delight in showing mercy\n\nAnd mercy triumphs over judgment\n\nAnd you delight in showing mercy\n\nAnd mercy triumphs over judgment\n\n\n\nWhat fortune lies beyond the stars\n\nThose dazzling heights too vast to climb\n\nI got so high to fall so far\n\nBut I found heaven as love swept low\n\n\n\nMy heart beating, my soul breathing\n\nI found my life when I laid it down\n\nUpward falling, spirit soaring\n\nI touch the sky when my knees hit the ground\n\n\n\nSo I'll wake and spend my days\n\nLoving the one who has raised me up\n\nHere at your feet again\n\nEverything I am, reaching out I surrender\n\nFrom death to life, from wrong to right\n\nYou're making all things beautiful\n\n\n\n'Cause you delight in showing mercy\n\nAnd mercy triumphs over judgment\n\nI know that you delight in showing mercy\n\nAnd mercy triumphs over judgment\n\n\n\nI touch the sky when my knees hit the ground"
