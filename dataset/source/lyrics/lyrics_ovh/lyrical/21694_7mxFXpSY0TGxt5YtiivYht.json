  "lyrics": "I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice\r\nI'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed\r\nYou bathed in my wine\r\nDrank from my cup, mocked my rhyme\r\nYour slit tongues licked my aching wounds\n\nPut a stake through my heart!\n\nAnd drag me into sunlight\n\nSo awake for your greed\n\nAs you're slaying the dreamer\n\n\n\nSwansong for the Wish of Night\n\nGod it hurts, give a name to the pain\n\nOur primrose path to hell is growing weed\n\n\n\nBlame me, it's me\n\nCoward, a good-for-nothing scapegoat\n\nDumb kid, living a dream\n\nRomantic only on paper\n\n\n\nTell me why you took all that was mine!\n\nStay as you lay - don't lead me astray!\n\n\n\nWake up, mow the weed\n\nYou'd be nothing without me\n\nTake my life if you have the heart to die\n\n\n\nYou bastards tainted my tool\n\nRaped my words, played me a fool\n\nGather your precious glitter and leave me be\n\nThe Great Ones are all dead\n\nAnd I'm tired, too\n\n\n\nI truly hate you all!"
