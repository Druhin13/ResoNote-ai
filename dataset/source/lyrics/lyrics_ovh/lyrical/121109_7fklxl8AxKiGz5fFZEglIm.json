  "lyrics": "Never wanted to feel weak in love, give up control\r\nNever wanted to let down my guard, be vulnerable\r\nNever wanted to feel helpless or too comfortable\r\nI make it on my own, hey\r\nI've been thinking a lot about the way that people change\n\nThe most beautiful beginnings can go down in flames\n\nIt's inevitable, and that's what's got me so afraid\n\nI'd rather be alone\n\n\n\nI don't want no white picket fence\n\nDozen roses and a wedding dress\n\nFairy tales are fake happiness\n\nBut here we are and I must confess\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused\n\nI'm losing my mind, don't know what to do\n\n'Cause I don't want to get married\n\nUnless it's with you, unless it's with you\n\n\n\nYou came into my life when I wasn't trying to find\n\nAnybody to love, hiding what I felt inside\n\nBut you opened me up and now I finally realize\n\nI'll be your girl for life\n\n\n\nWe don't need a big audience\n\nThousand people we never met\n\nMe and you and a couple of friends\n\nAnd here we are and I must confess\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm in over my head feeling confused\n\nI'm losing my mind, don't know what to do\n\n'Cause I don't want to get married\n\nUnless it's with you, unless it's with you\n\n\n\nAnd oh, I know that it's scary\n\nBut I know that it's true, I'm saying \"I do\"\n\n'Cause I don't want to get married\n\nUnless it's with you, unless it's with you\n\n\n\nBeating heart and trembling hands\n\nTake me just the way I am\n\n'Cause all that I want is one and the same\n\nFor the rest of my days, for the rest of my days\n\n\n\nYou can ask me in a hundred years\n\nIf I would still be standing here\n\nWhen we're old and gray, I'd answer the same\n\nOur love will remain, oh, our love will remain\n\n\n\nYeah, I was over my head feeling confused\n\nBeen losing my mind, don't know what to do\n\n'Cause I don't want to get married\n\nUnless it's with you, unless it's with you\n\n\n\nAnd oh, I know that it's scary\n\n(But I know that it's true, I'm saying \"I do\")\n\n'Cause I don't want to get married\n\nUnless it's with you, unless it's with you\n\nUnless it's with you"
