  "lyrics": "And I take you down to the burning ground\r\nAnd you change me up and you turned it around\r\nIn the wind and rain I'm gonna see you again\r\nIn the morning sun and when the day is done\r\nAnd you take my hand and you walk with me\r\nSometimes it feels like eternity\n\nAnd I turn the tide I get back my pride\n\nAnd I make you proud won't you say it out loud\n\nWhen I take you down to the burning ground\n\nTo the burning ground, to the burning ground\n\nTo the burning ground, to the burning ground\n\n\n\nAnd I take you down by the factory\n\nAnd I show you like it has to be\n\nAnd you understand how the work is done\n\nAnd I pick up the sack in the midday sun\n\nAnd I pull you through by the skin of your teeth\n\nAnd I lift the veil, I see what's underneath\n\nAnd you return to me and you sit on your throne\n\nAnd you make me feel that I'm not alone\n\n\n\nAnd I take you down to the burning ground\n\nTo the burning ground, to the burning ground\n\nTo the burning ground\n\n\n\nHey man, what's that you're carrying?\n\n\n\nFeels like lead\n\n\n\nIt weighs a ton - let's see if we can dump it by the side of the hill\n\n\n\nHey wait up, why don't you dump it on the burning ground\n\n\n\nDump it down there\n\n\n\nYeh man, dump the Jute\n\n\n\nHey man dump the Jute on the burning ground\n\n\n\nDump the Jute?\n\n\n\nYeh you know, dump the Jute\n\n\n\nDump the Jute!\n\n\n\nOn the burning ground\n\nOn the burning ground\n\nAnd you make me think what it's all about\n\nSometimes I know gonna work it out\n\nAnd I watch you run in the crimson sun\n\nTear my shirt apart open up my heart\n\nAnd I watch you run\n\nDown on your bended knees\n\nBy the burnt out well\n\nCan you tell me please\n\nBetween heaven and hell\n\nWon't you take me down\n\n\n\nTo the burning ground, to the burning ground\n\nTo the burning ground, to the burning ground\n\n\n\nAnd you fall and pray, when you hear that sound\n\nAs we're walking back to the burial mound\n\nAnd you shake your head and you turn it around\n\nAnd you see the flames from the burning ground\n\nAnd you get down on your knees and pray\n\nAnd I catch my breath as we're running away\n\nAnd I take the Jute and I throw him down\n\n\n\nOn the burning ground, on the burning ground\n\nOn the burning ground, it's on the burning ground....."
