This is an official distress call, over\r\nWe all know a place that appears so sublime\r\nBut if you dive a little deeper, you'll hit the real bottom line\n\nThe head of the town is out there flashing his teeth\n\nA telltale sign about to surface that there's a monster lurking underneath\n\n\n\nThey're thrashing around but found\n\nThey can't contain a leak\n\nCause I've got a fish to fry\n\nThat's feeding on the weak\n\nSo cast a line for every life they took\n\nIt's time to set the hook\n\n\n\nWe're all just floating in a shallow grave\n\nBuoyed by the blood of the masses\n\nThat they'd rather sell out that instead of save\n\nWe're all so starving that we've taken the bait\n\nYou think we would've learned from the past that\n\nThe predator will soon become the prey\n\n\n\nWe all know a place\n\nWhere the calm flees at night\n\nAnd safe is just a shadow\n\nSo we swim towards the light\n\nIf this voyage of valor put us on deck for death\n\nWe'll compare scars with each other\n\nUntil our very last breath, yeah!\n\n\n\nThey're thrashing around but found\n\nThey can't contain a leak\n\nCause I've got a fish to fry\n\nThat's feeding on the weak\n\nSo reel it in with every trick in the book\n\nIt's time to set the hook\n\n\n\nWe're all just floating in a shallow grave\n\nBuoyed by the blood of the masses\n\nThat they'd rather sell out that instead of safe\n\nWe're all so starving that we've taken the bait\n\nYou think we would've learned from the past that\n\nThe predator will soon become the prey\n\n\n\nYeah, coastguard this is the orca again, we need you out here now. The boat is under attack. It's a great white, over\n\nRoger that, ETA fifteen minutes, over\n\nIn fifteen minutes we'll be fucking shark bate\n\n\n\nLast chance to make amends\n\nSo try to stay afloat\n\nWith sharks like you among us\n\nWe'll need a bigger boat\n\nSold us down the river\n\nSo the rich could stay rich\n\nBut now you've been caught\n\nSo smile, you son of a bitch\n\n\n\nSinking with the burning embers\n\nShould be any sign of doubt\n\nThat this tale will be remembered\n\nAnd the tide will forever flush them out\n\n\n\nWe're all just floating in a shallow grave\n\nBuoyed by the blood of the masses\n\nThat they'd rather sell out that instead of safe\n\nWe're all so starving that we've taken the bait\n\nYou think we would've learned from the past that\n\nThe predator will soon become the prey"
