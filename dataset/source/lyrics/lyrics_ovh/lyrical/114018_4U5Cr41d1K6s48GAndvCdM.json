  "lyrics": "Well they say people come\r\nSay people go\r\nThis particular diamond \nWas extra special\r\nAnd though you might be gone\r\nAnd the world may not know\n\nStill I see you celestial\n\n\n\nLike a lion you ran\n\nA goddess you rolled\n\nLike an eagle you circled\n\nIn perfect purple\n\nSo how come things move on?\n\nHow come cars don't slow?\n\nWhen it feels like the end of my world?\n\nWhen I should but I can't let you go\n\n\n\nBut when I'm cold,\n\nCold\n\nAnd I'm cold\n\nCold\n\nThere's a light that you give me\n\nWhen I'm in shadow\n\nThere's a feeling you give me, an everglow\n\n\n\nLike brothers in blood\n\nSisters who ride\n\nYeah we swore on that night we'd \n\nBe friends till we died\n\nBut the changing of winds\n\nAnd the way waters flow\n\nLife is short as the falling of snow\n\nAnd now I'm gonna miss you, I know\n\n\n\nBut when I'm cold\n\nCold\n\nIn water rolled\n\nSalt\n\nAnd I know that you're with me\n\nAnt the way you will show\n\nAnd you're with me wherever I go\n\nBut you give me this feeling, this everglow\n\n\n\nYeah what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold\n\nYeah I live for this feeling, this everglow\n\n\n\nSo if you love someone\n\nYou should let them know\n\nOh, the light that you left me will everglow"
