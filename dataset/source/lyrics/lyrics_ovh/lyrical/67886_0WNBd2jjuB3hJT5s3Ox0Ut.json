Huh, not us\n\nI care 'cause I care, but need to not care as much\n\nAbout what I'm chasin'\n\nLike the clock is tickin' on my patience\n\nFeelin' stuck, why can't I get out of Lamentations\n\nThinkin' I'm not that unique, maybe it's true\n\nBut you know what, neither are you\n\nSo I tell 'em\n\n\n\nA dime a dozen, don't you act like this\n\nFlyin' somewhere and you can't come with\n\nSteady searchin,' I ain't found that yet\n\nBut I guess that's how it gotta be\n\nA dime a dozen, don't you act like this\n\nFlyin' somewhere and you can't come with\n\nSteady searchin,' I ain't found that yet\n\nBut I guess that's how it gotta be\n\nA dime a dozen, don't you act like this\n\nFlyin' somewhere and you can't come with\n\nSteady searchin,' I ain't found that yet\n\nBut I guess that's how it gotta be\n\nA dime a dozen, don't you act like this\n\nFlyin' somewhere and you can't come with\n\nSteady searchin,' I ain't found that yet\n\nBut I guess that's how it gotta be\n\n\n\nThose aren't the notes at all, are they?\n\nBut it's okay"
