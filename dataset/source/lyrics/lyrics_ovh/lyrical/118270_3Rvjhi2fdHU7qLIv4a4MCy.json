  "lyrics": "Mama, just killed a man\r\nPut a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead\r\nMama, life had just begun\r\nBut now I’ve gone and thrown it all away\r\nMama, ooh\r\nDidn't mean to make you cry\n\nIf I'm not back again this time tomorrow\n\nCarry on, carry on as if nothing really matters\n\n\n\nToo late, my time has come\n\nSends shivers down my spine, body’s aching all the time\n\nGoodbye, everybody; I've got to go\n\nGotta leave you all behind and face the truth\n\nMama, ooh\n\nI don't want to die\n\nBut sometimes wish I'd never been born at all"
