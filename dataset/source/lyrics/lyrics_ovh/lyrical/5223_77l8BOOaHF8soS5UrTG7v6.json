  "lyrics": "I was singin' like a stone in Red Wing, Minnesota\r\nIn a bar called Kelly's right next to the train\r\nIt shakes the walls and you have to stop talkin'\r\nIt's never much different but it's never the same\r\nAnd the guy next to me he was fightin' for nothin'\n\nLove that was over and a knife in the back\n\nI was seein' double so I went out walkin'\n\nI didn't know if I would ever get back\n\n\n\nMet a girl downtown and she was covered in lightning\n\nShe thought my weakness was drownin' but I didn't agree\n\nWell the cops were out watchin' everybody that was drivin'\n\nAny one of you here could sing it better than me\n\n\n\nAnd the sun was risin' on the banks of the river\n\nI was dying in Tom's back yard\n\nNo idea how I ended up Winona\n\nNo idea how I let it go this far\n\n\n\nAnd every summer there that I can remember\n\nI'm certain this person meant a lot to me\n\nYeah maybe I've changed, yeah baby everybody changes\n\nAnd maybe you're not where you thought you would be\n\n\n\nBut I dream about it on the nights when I'm sleepin'\n\nAnd I wake up screamin' in my own damn bed\n\nYeah I'll work harder at the people that I'm keepin'\n\nIf you work harder gettin' outta my head"
