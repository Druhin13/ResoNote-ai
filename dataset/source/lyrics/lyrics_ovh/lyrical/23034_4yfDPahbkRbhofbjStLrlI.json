  "lyrics": "Save your breath, don't say you care\r\nI'm dumb, I'm deaf\r\nYou broke me there\r\nOf all I've known, our pain is real\r\nBut I try to hold the hand you deal\r\nThough I sleep alone, I don't walk alone\n\nAnd I've come to know what I need\n\n\n\nAnd I don't grow these days\n\nThere's something in my way\n\nBut I don't try to wait\n\nThere's nothing in my day\n\nThat I wanna replace\n\n\n\nI'm scared to know how long I'll love\n\nThe time I've seen you rise above\n\nThough I sleep alone, I don't walk alone\n\nAnd I've come to know what I need\n\n\n\nAnd I don't grow these days\n\nThere's something in my way\n\nBut I don't try to wait\n\nThere's nothing in my day\n\nAnd I don't grow these days\n\nThere's something in my way\n\nBut I don't try to wait\n\nThere's nothing in my day\n\nThat I wanna replace"
