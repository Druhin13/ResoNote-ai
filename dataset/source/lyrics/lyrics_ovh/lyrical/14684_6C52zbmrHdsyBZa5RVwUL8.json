  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Permanent Vacation par The Academic\r\nDid you find what you had before?\nCan you see what you want to ignore?\nYes, there’s no doubt about it \nDid you buy what you can’t afford?\nYou’re waking up on the kitchen floor\nYes, there’s no doubt about it \nNo doubt about it\n\nTrying to figure out who you’re supposed to be\nHow’d you find yourself if you never leave\nI live my whole life in a fantasy\nAnd I’m about to let go\n\nWhat’s my motivation?\nYou see so much more than you could see before\nIt’s a permanent vacation\n\nI’m willing to learn but I won’t wait my turn\nWhat’s my motivation?\nTo leave this permanent vacation\n\nCan’t you drive like we’re out of time\nYou spend your money and you know it’s a crime\nYes, there’s no doubt about it\nSo give it up but you don’t know why\nSo kiss goodbye to the summer \nYes, there’s no doubt about it\nNo doubt about it\n\nTrying to figure out who you’re supposed to be\nHow’d you find yourself if you never leave\nI live my whole life in a fantasy\nAnd I’m about to let go\n\nWhat’s my motivation?\n\nYou see so much more than you could see before\nIt’s a permanent vacation\nI’m willing to learn but I won’t wait my turn\nWhat’s my motivation\nTo leave this permanent vacation\nTo leave this permanent vacation\n\nIt’s time to go\nI said oh,\nIt’s time to go\n\nWhat’s my motivation?\nYou see so much more than you could see before\nIt’s a permanent vacation\nI’m willing to learn but I won’t wait my turn\nWhat’s my motivation\nTo leave this permanent vacation\nTo leave this permanent vacation"
