  "lyrics": "I told you I would come back home\r\nI know you hate to be alone\r\nInstead of kissing you goodnight I'm kissing strangers\r\nAlways listen but I'll never learn\r\nShoulda been hanging on your every word\r\nI was taking you for granted never realized the danger\n\n\n\nAnd now I took too long\n\nAnd now she's gone\n\nIf I only knew right from wrong\n\nShe'd be right back in my arms\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I got is you\n\nAll I got is you\n\n\n\nI always meant to hold you closer\n\nBut I don't always do what I'm supposed to\n\nNow you're slipping through my fingers and I don't know what to do\n\nAnd I keep hoping you call back\n\nCan we forget about the past\n\nCause baby all I really want is you\n\n\n\nAnd now I took too long\n\nAnd now she's gone\n\nIf I only knew right from wrong\n\nShe'd be right back in my arms\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I got is you\n\nAll I got is you\n\n\n\n4am and I cannot say goodbye\n\nCrawling back home id do anything for you\n\nAnd I'm sitting up awake and now I can't forget you and I don't know what to do\n\n\n\nYeah"
