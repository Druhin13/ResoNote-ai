  "lyrics": "They appear\r\nI remember when the fire was security\r\nNow it's killing me\r\nA wolf can't hunt without its prey\r\nSo take me to my grave\r\nThe demons dance by the fireside\n\nBut tonight they migrate to my bedside\n\n\n\nBurn the bed\n\nBurn everything\n\nIt's a lie anyway\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere left to run\n\nThere's nowhere left for me to be\n\nWithout you by my side\n\n\n\nI cry but if you take a closer look\n\nYou'll see it's a demon's eyes\n\nThere's no coming back for me\n\nFor my spirit guide is trapped inside my brain\n\nI don't know who I am\n\nIn the name of the Father and the Holy Ghost\n\nClose your gates, lock the doors, there is no hope\n\n\n\nBurn the bed\n\nBurn everything\n\nIt's a lie anyway\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere left to run\n\nThere's nowhere left for me to be\n\nWithout you by my side\n\nHow could the world take you from me\n\nThey all deserve to burn with me\n\n\n\nWhat has the world come to\n\nWhen a demon defiles a witch\n\nNobody trusts a word I say\n\nI can't erase these memories\n\nBut I will erase humanity\n\nErase humanity\n\n\n\nBurn the bed\n\nBurn everything\n\nIt's a lie anyway\n\n\n\nThere's nowhere left to run\n\nThere's nowhere left for me to be\n\nWithout you by my side\n\nHow could the world take you from me\n\nThey all deserve to burn with me"
