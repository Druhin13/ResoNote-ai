  "lyrics": "I see the smoke rising high from our ashes\r\nI feel the fire lose its warmth once again\r\nSwimming in the rain with our last book of matches\r\nI can't find the flame, I can't feel a thing\r\nYou got that faking look in your pretty blue eyes\n\nI need a break\n\nI need a break in the worst way\n\nI need a break for a second or an hour of the day\n\nI need a heartbreak\n\nI need a heartbreak\n\n\n\nGive me a night where the stars make a blanket\n\nGive me a day drinking naked on the kitchen floor\n\nI want the kind of love that hurts when you take it away from me\n\nI think that now you see\n\nYou got that faking look in your pretty blue eyes\n\n\n\nI need a break\n\nI need a break in the worst way\n\nI need a break for a second or an hour of the day\n\nI need a heartbreak\n\nI need a heartbreak\n\n\n\nOh, these fights don't feel like they used to\n\nI need more\n\nOh, these fights don't feel like they used to\n\nI need more\n\nOh, these fights don't feel like they used to\n\nI need more\n\n\n\nI need a break\n\nI need a break in the worst way\n\nI need a break for a second or an hour of the day\n\nI need a heartbreak\n\nI need a heartbreak"
