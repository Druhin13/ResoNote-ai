  "lyrics": "Your heart is mine\r\nThe moment you laid eyes on mine\r\nI memorized every line, every crease in the kind of your smile\r\nIt’s a crime\r\nWhat a find\n\nAnd my path is so clear\n\nThat my fears disappear\n\nAnd I can’t picture life like before\n\nBecause your\n\nYour heart is mine\n\nYour heart is mine\n\nI see the signs\n\nYou’re mesmerized\n\nYour heart is mine\n\n\n\nAnd I won’t take it for granted\n\nMine\n\nAnd I won’t step on your soul\n\n‘Cause your trust is mine\n\nLike a butterfly lands in your hands\n\nWith wings that you can’t hold\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I look up with pride as you take to the sky\n\nAnd I know you will fly back to me in good time, ’cause\n\nYour heart is mine\n\nSo go and fly\n\nTear up the sky\n\nYou’re gonna find\n\nYou’re gonna find in time\n\n\n\nYOUR HEART IS MINE\n\n\n\n(YOUR HEART IS MINE)\n\nAnd you can try it darlin’\n\n(TRY TO DENY)\n\nTry to deny your heart when\n\n(I SEE THE SIGNS)\n\nYou know it when you feel it\n\n(YOUR HEART IS MINE)\n\nIt’s deeper than you’d like to admit\n\n\n\nBut that’s all right\n\n‘Cause your heart is mine\n\nI said that’s all right, go and fly because\n\nYour heart will always be mine\n\nGo and fly because your heart is mine\n\n\n\nYour heart is mine\n\nYour heart is mine\n\nWe’re intertwined\n\nThe stars aligned\n\nYour heart is\n\nYOUR HEART IS MINE"
