  "lyrics": "Over and over, you keep singing the same old song\r\nI used to be stronger, the silence is longer, now I'm the bitter one\r\nI've made mistakes, and I'll take it all back\r\nI feel I feel so typical\r\nJust another ghost from so so long ago\n\nAnother faint reminder\n\nI still need you, do you need me\n\nCan you see right through me now\n\nOr should I just let go\n\nI'm just another ghost\n\n\n\nAgain and again, I keep having the same nightmare\n\nI used to be younger, I'm losing the hunger, not having any fun\n\nI've made mistakes and I'll take it all back\n\n\n\nI feel I feel so typical\n\nJust another ghost from so so long ago\n\nAnother faint reminder\n\nI still need you, do you need me\n\nCan you see right through me now\n\nOr should I just let go\n\nI'm just another ghost\n\n\n\nAll of these fractures are killing my passion\n\nWeighed down by anchors of negativity\n\n\n\nJust another ghost\n\nCracking to the core\n\n\n\nI still need you, do you need me\n\nCan you see right through me now\n\n\n\nJust another ghost\n\nShould I just let go\n\n\n\nI still need you, do you need me\n\nCan you see right through me now\n\nI still need you, I still need you, I still need you\n\nJust another ghost\n\n\n\nI feel I feel so typical\n\nJust another ghost from so so long ago\n\nAnother faint reminder\n\nI still need you, do you need me\n\nCan you see right through me now\n\nOr should I just let go\n\nI'm just another ghost"
