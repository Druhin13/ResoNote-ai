  "lyrics": "Don't call pretty Peggy,\r\nshe can't hear you no more\r\nDon't leave no message\r\n'round her back door.\r\nThey say the old laughing lady\r\nbeen here before\n\nShe don't keep time,\n\nshe don't count score.\n\n\n\nYou can't have a cupboard\n\nif there ain't no wall.\n\nYou got to move there's\n\nno time left to stall.\n\nThey say the old laughing lady\n\ndropped by to call\n\nAnd when she leaves,\n\nshe leaves nothing at all.\n\n\n\nSee the drunkard of the village\n\nfalling on the street.\n\nCan't tell his ankles\n\nfrom the rest of his feet.\n\nHe loves his old laughing lady\n\n'cause her taste is so sweet.\n\nBut his laughing lady's loving\n\nain't the kind he can keep.\n\n\n\nThere's a fever on the freeway,\n\nblacks out the night.\n\nThere's a slipping on the stairway,\n\njust don't feel right\n\nAnd there's a rumbling\n\nin the bedroom\n\nand a flashing of light\n\nThere's the old laughing lady,\n\neverything is all right."
