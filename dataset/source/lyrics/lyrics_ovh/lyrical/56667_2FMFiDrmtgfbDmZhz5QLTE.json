  "lyrics": "I'm a believer\r\nSometimes I believe the lies of the deceiver\r\nThe lies of seeds when they sprout\r\nThey lead to seasons of spiritual amnesia\r\nDeep seeded self doubt\r\nThat creeps in my conscious feeds my fear\n\nAnd keeps me up at night conquered by\n\nCritical thoughts my mind is prone to conjure\n\nWhen it wanders, watching my failures, play back play back on repeat\n\nIm trying to change the chain of events but\n\nCan't rewind to find the delete, button to push\n\nI'm on the edge its like the world is about to end\n\nI'm in the middle of armagaddon with\n\nNo arms, no weapons, no armor for protection\n\nIt's the testing of my faith and\n\nI know the answers but instead I'm just guessing\n\nLike I forgot that God was my father and\n\nI was set apart for his on possession\n\nHis word is my armor and my protection\n\nAgainst the enemy's deception\n\nBut I still question\n\nHow can i receive\n\nSuch an incredible blessing when I feel like I'm less than\n\nBecause I went through a divorce am I\n\nA second rate Christian I know that's a lie\n\nSo I won't listen through Christ I'm forgiven\n\nIm being formed into his image\n\nAccording to God I'm was called from darkness into his marvelous light\n\nHe is near to the broken hearted faithful to finish what he started\n\n\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\n\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\n\n\nAs a child I struggled to\n\nIdentify most of my misplaced anger and rage\n\nDealing with a whole emotion of consequences\n\nBased on the way I was raised\n\nThe feeling for affection and affirmation\n\nAdjusted performance to get attention and\n\nGain some sort of acceptance but found\n\nI was always rejected and pushed away\n\nDeep scars feeling of not belonging\n\nCaused hall emotional walls and any\n\nAttempt to recover from a lost of\n\nConfidence was incredibly small\n\nThe residual effects of abandonment\n\nHad me observing my character flaws\n\nAnd viewing them all as insufficiently\n\nCapable of relating or growing with God\n\nI believed these lies to be true for me\n\nMy experience was the proof for me\n\nUp to the point where I can sense Christ\n\nRelentless love and complete pursuit of me\n\nAnd spoke to me offering me hope and life\n\nThrough his word showing me his beauty\n\nChanging my perception and giving me\n\nPerspective of the way God truly viewed me\n\nA man who was prized and pardoned\n\nAnd chosen before the world's foundation\n\nHis whole possession, his royal priesthood\n\nI'm part of his holy nation\n\nI'm his friend, I'm valued completely cared for\n\nEnough for Christ to purchase\n\nAccording to God I'm an adopted child\n\nWith intimate access created with purpose\n\n\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\n\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\n\n\n(Thanks to James for these lyrics)"
