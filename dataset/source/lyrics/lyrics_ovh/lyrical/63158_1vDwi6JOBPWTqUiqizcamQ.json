  "lyrics": "Muriel was born on a cold afternoon in November\r\n84 years ago, changing the world with a cry\r\nReading the lines on her face, so much to remember\r\nHer father was down by the lake when Samuel died\r\nMarie, Marie\n\nLay down your hands on me\n\nOnce in a while, I don ́t see\n\nA way out of here\n\nMarie, Marie\n\nCome on and dance with me\n\nInto the light\n\n`Cause I ́m lost in the dark\n\n\n\nCyrus was talking `bout war, he said time is a healer\n\nWhat will remain of the stories that we all forget\n\nThey found him this morning in tears, down on the kneeler\n\nHe opened his heart and he lost everything that he had\n\n\n\nMarie, Marie\n\nLay down your hands on me\n\nOnce in a while, I don ́t see\n\nA way out of here\n\nMarie, Marie\n\nCome on and dance with me\n\nInto the light\n\n`Cause I ́m lost in the dark\n\n\n\nOh Marie\n\nDon ́t let it rain on me\n\nOnce in a while, I don ́t see\n\nA way out of here\n\nMarie, Marie\n\nDance to the light with me\n\nShow me the way\n\n`Cause I ́m lost in the dark"
