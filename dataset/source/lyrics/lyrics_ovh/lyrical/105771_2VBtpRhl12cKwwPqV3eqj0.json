  "lyrics": "I'm told that love is golden\r\nSomething to hold when the going's tough\r\nAnd I've seen, what love can mean when\r\nSomeone believes in you more than you ever could\r\nI felt that same, same rhythm in the same, same rush\n\nGot that same, same feeling from the same touch\n\nIt's like a wildfire growing 'tween my head and my heart\n\n\n\nI can only wonder why I can see in color without you\n\nAnd I don't wanna try 'cause I see how the colors surround you\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\n\n\nI've heard, your vision blurs\n\nYour stomach turns and you trip over every word\n\n\n\nI felt that same, same rhythm in the same, same rush\n\nGot that same, same feeling from the same touch\n\nIt's like a wildfire growing 'tween my head and my heart\n\n\n\nI can only wonder why I can see in color without you\n\nAnd I don't wanna try 'cause I see how the colors surround you\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\n\n\nI can only wonder why I can see in color without you\n\nAnd I don't wanna try 'cause I see how the colors surround you\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\nYou light up the dark in me\n\nYou light up the dark in me"
