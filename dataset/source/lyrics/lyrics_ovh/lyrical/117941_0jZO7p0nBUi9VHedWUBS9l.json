  "lyrics": "I am not the only traveler\r\nWho has not repaid his debt\r\nI've been searching for a trail to follow again\r\nTake me back to the night we met\r\nAnd then I can tell myself\n\nWhat the hell I'm supposed to do\n\nAnd then I can tell myself\n\nNot to ride along with you\n\n\n\nI had all and then most of you\n\nSome and now none of you\n\nTake me back to the night we met\n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do\n\nHaunted by the ghost of you\n\nTake me back to the night we met\n\n\n\nWhen the night was full of terrors\n\nAnd your eyes were filled with tears\n\nWhen you had not touched me yet\n\nOh, take me back to the night we met\n\n\n\nI had all and then most of you\n\nSome and now none of you\n\nTake me back to the night we met\n\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do\n\nHaunted by the ghost of you\n\nTake me back to the night we met"
