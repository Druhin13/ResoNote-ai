  "lyrics": "Heaven never ever heard a word I said\r\nI’ve cried enough to raise the dead\r\n“Everything comes and goes,” they say\r\nHere tomorrow, gone today\r\nHeaven won’t let me in, I don’t know why\n\nNo one ever loved half as much as I\n\nEveryone’s a sinner in the balancer’s eye\n\nI’ve prayed enough, I rolled the dice\n\nAnyone’s luck can turn, I’ve heard\n\nNot soon enough, I gave my word\n\n\n\nI was born right into nothing\n\nUnder a very bad sign\n\nCan I cross beyond that line?\n\nIs it in my mind?\n\nIs it in my mind?\n\nIs it in my mind?\n\nIs it in my mind?\n\n\n\nNothing’s waiting for us in the great sky\n\nLife is equal to dust in the balancer’s eye\n\nNow I know that I can’t lift an old curse\n\nTell me, how does a man change the universe?\n\n\n\nWill I ever be forgiven for the crime of my life?\n\nWill it haunt me ’til I die?\n\nTo the end of time\n\nTo the end of time\n\nTo the end of time\n\nTo the end of time\n\n\n\nHeaven won’t let me in, I don’t know why\n\nNo one ever loved half as much as I\n\n\n\nIf I follow the starlight and call your name\n\nWill I see you again on the astral plane?\n\nI been learnin’ the truth — made me feel worse\n\nTell me, how does a man change the universe?\n\nDoesn’t matter; it’s too late to do right\n\nHeading into the void at the speed of light\n\nNow I know that I can’t lift an old curse\n\nTell me, how does a man change the universe?\n\n\n\nTell me, how does a man change the universe?\n\nTell me, how does a man change the universe?\n\n\n\nFollow the emerald star!"
