  "lyrics": "You wanna do something right\r\nStruggle for a brighter side\r\nTake the best part of what’s left of your life\r\nYou could do most anything but you’re down there on your own\r\nAnytime, anyhow but you’re afraid of getting out\n\nYou’re stuck up in a vicious circle when these words are on your mind\n\n\n\nEveryone around you knows\n\nExactly how to deal with getting old\n\nYou can’t tell who is wrong and who is right\n\n\n\nYou could do most anything but you’re down there on your own\n\nAnytime, anyhow but you’re afraid of getting out\n\nHelp me between two motions of my life\n\nI’ll do anything to finally ride this out\n\nYou know how it feels when these words are on your mind\n\n\n\nYou could do most anything but you’re down there on your own\n\nAnytime, anyhow but you’re afraid of getting out\n\nHelp me between two motions of my life\n\nI’ll do anything to finally ride this out\n\nYou know how it feels when these words are on your mind\n\n\n\nOh help me between the two motions of my life\n\nI’ll do anything to finally ride this out\n\nYou know how it feels when these words are on your mind"
