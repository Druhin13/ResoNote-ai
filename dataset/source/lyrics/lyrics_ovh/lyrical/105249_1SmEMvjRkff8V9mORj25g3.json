  "lyrics": "We were dancing on the beach\r\nYou were holding onto me\r\nAnd my chest, I felt the beating of your heart\r\nAnother late night reverie\r\nSeconds felt like years to me\r\nYou said, \"Baby, let's just stay right where we are\"\n\n\n\nAnd I guess we should have known\n\nIt was too good to go on\n\nBut there's something about us that I just refuse to let go\n\n\n\nI remember, I remember summer nights\n\nYou were like a midnight day dream\n\nNeon lights\n\nWe were making waves in the back seat\n\nEvery time I close my eyes\n\nOr sinking through the pain or the memory\n\nI'm holding on for what it's worth\n\nI guess I love the way it hurts\n\nSo good\n\nI love the way it hurts\n\nSo good\n\n\n\nThere's a pounding in my chest\n\nA rush of blood goes to my head\n\nThought I saw your silhoutte pass by the door\n\nAnd even though it hurts like hell\n\nI just cannot help myself\n\nI crave the way it makes me feel but it leaves me wanting more\n\n\n\nI remember, and I remember summer nights\n\nYou were like a midnight day dream\n\nNeon lights\n\nWe were making waves in the back seat\n\nEvery time I close my eyes\n\nOr sinking through the pain or the memory\n\nI'm holding on for what it's worth\n\nI guess I love the way it hurts\n\nSo good\n\nI love the way it hurts\n\nSo good, hey\n\n\n\nAnd I guess we should have known\n\nIt was too good to go on\n\nBut there's something about us that I just refuse to let go\n\n\n\nAnd I remember summer nights\n\nYou were like a midnight day dream\n\nNeon lights\n\nWe were making waves in the back seat\n\nEvery time I close my eyes\n\nOr sinking through the pain or the memory\n\nI'm holding on for what it's worth\n\nI guess I love the way it hurts\n\nSo good\n\nI love the way it hurts (love the way it hurts)\n\nSo good\n\nI guess I love the way it hurts (I love the way it hurts)\n\nSo good\n\nI love the way it hurts (love the way, I love the way, I love the way it hurts)\n\nSo good"
