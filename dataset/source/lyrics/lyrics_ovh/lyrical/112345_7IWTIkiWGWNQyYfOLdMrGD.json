  "lyrics": "Flash far, I'm coming for ya\r\nYou're gonna fill me like the summer, like the sun in your eyes\r\nHold tight, another minute\r\nAnother hour, baby, imma' show you\r\nYou can rely on me\n\nI'll give you all you need\n\nIn a small cloud, tryna find ground\n\nIn a place where we belong\n\n\n\nWe don't have to dream to make it beautiful\n\nBaby, everything we do is beautiful\n\nWe can light a fire, watch it everglow\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out\n\n\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out\n\n\n\nWon't take a million dollars\n\nFor us to have a kind of love you only see in a dream\n\nWake up, 'cause now you're in it\n\nI wanna show you all the magic in the air\n\n\n\nAnd tonight is free\n\nIt will be all you need\n\nIn a small cloud, tryna find ground\n\nIn a place where we belong\n\n\n\nWe don't have to dream to make it beautiful\n\nBaby, everything we do is beautiful\n\nWe can light a fire, watch it everglow\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out\n\n\n\nWe won't burn out, we won't burn out"
