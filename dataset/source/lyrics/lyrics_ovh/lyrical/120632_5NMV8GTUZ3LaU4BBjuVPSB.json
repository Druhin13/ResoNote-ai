  "lyrics": "Caught in the tide of our own divide\r\nOur moment to make a stand\r\nWe're all in the fight for a future bright\r\nIt's burning inside our hands\r\nFell on a line on our own this time\r\nWe failed the forgotten man\n\n\n\nYour reality is our insanity\n\nOur humanity is tearing at the seams\n\n\n\nAaa-ah, never going back, never going back now\n\nAaa-ah, never gonna back, never gonna back down\n\n\n\nBlinded by faith and devotion\n\nShade the fire inside our hearts\n\nTies that we've made have been broken by the\n\nLies that pull us apart\n\nTime that we take will be stolen from a\n\nDream that was almost ours\n\n\n\nYour reality is our insanity\n\nOur humanity is calling to be free\n\n\n\nAaa-ah, never going back, never going back now\n\nAaa-ah, never gonna back, never gonna back down\n\nAaa-ah, never going back, never going back now\n\nAaa-ah, never gonna back, never gonna back down\n\n\n\nYou and I\n\nTurned away from the promise to try\n\nYou and I\n\nFound our faith in the will of a lie\n\nYou and I\n\n\n\nAaa-ah, never going back, never going back now\n\nAaa-ah, never gonna back, never gonna back down\n\nAaa-ah, never going back, never going back now\n\nAaa-ah, never gonna back, never gonna back down"
