  "lyrics": "I wonder if I'll still be here\r\nWorking the same job in a year\r\nAlone some nights I pour a beer and think about\r\nAll the things I can't control\r\nMy boss, the bills and growing old\n\nI pray to God that down the road\n\nIt'll all work out\n\nBut all I know right now\n\n\n\nIs I'll be up in the morning with coffee a pouring\n\nAnd take it on down the road\n\nI'll be swinging a hammer and climbing a ladder\n\nAnd hauling that heavy load\n\nAnd girl I'll keep on trying, keep on driving on\n\nDriving through, just as long\n\nAs I can drive on home to you\n\n\n\nI wanna buy that house you always slow down for\n\nPark a new car in the drive and tell you it's yours\n\nThe fact that you don't want me to makes me want to more\n\nThat's what I'm working for\n\n\n\nSo I'll be up in the morning with coffee a pouring\n\nAnd take it on down the road\n\nI'll be swinging a hammer and climbing a ladder\n\nAnd hauling that heavy load\n\nAnd girl I'll keep on trying, keep on driving on\n\nDriving through, just as long\n\nAs I can drive on home to you\n\n\n\nJust to be all alone with you\n\nIt's all that I want to do\n\nSo, I do what I gotta do\n\nGirl what I gotta do\n\n\n\nIs be up in the morning with coffee a pouring\n\nAnd take it on down the road\n\nI'll be swinging a hammer and climbing a ladder\n\nAnd hauling that heavy load\n\nAnd girl I'll keep on trying, keep on driving on\n\nDriving through, just as long\n\nYeah just as long\n\nAs I can drive on home to you\n\n\n\nBaby drive\n\nDrive on home to you"
