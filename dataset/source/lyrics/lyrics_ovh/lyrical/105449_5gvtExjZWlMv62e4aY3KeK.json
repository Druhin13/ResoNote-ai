Are you with me, honey?\n\nI have cried for you, and I'll ride for you\n\nI would die for you, would you do that for me?\n\nTell the truth, what you wanna do\n\nIs it me and you? Are you with me?\n\n\n\nSo are we leaving this garden of eden?\n\nAre we leaving this garden of eden?\n\nNow I know what I know\n\nBut it's hard to find the meaning\n\nWhere do we go?\n\nCause we don't believe in this garden of eden\n\n(Eden, eden, eden)\n\nThis garden of eden\n\n(Eden, eden, eden)\n\n\n\nRemember when we swam in the ocean?\n\nNow we know what's deep inside\n\nRemember when we ran in the open?\n\n\n\nSo are we leaving?\n\n(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)\n\nAre we leaving?\n\n(Are we leaving this garden of eden?)\n\nNow I know what I know\n\nBut it's hard to find the meaning\n\nWhere do we go?\n\nCause we don't believe in this garden of eden\n\n(Eden, eden, eden)\n\nThis garden of eden\n\n(Eden, eden, eden)"
