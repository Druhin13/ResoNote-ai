  "lyrics": "All I have right now is right here\r\nAnd right now\r\nI want what I want, I always have\r\nWhen no one cared about me, dreams were all I had\r\nBut nightmares grow and no one's listening\n\nAnd idle thoughts'll do their thing\n\nI still feel so much pain here from the past\n\n\n\nAnd it cuts like a knife\n\nIt feels like a fight\n\nTo take back your life\n\n\n\nSearching for the meaning\n\nI'm living in these feelings\n\nI'm ready for a reason to believe\n\nNow I'm working on my insides\n\n'Cause outside there's no reasoning\n\nIf anyone's here it's never what it seems\n\n\n\nAll I have right now is right here\n\n\n\nI felt too bad about myself\n\nI never thought I was good enough for anybody else\n\nI couldn't look love in the eye\n\nI was too broken to try\n\nLife was a cold song that taught me not to cry\n\n\n\nAnd it cuts like a knife\n\nIt feels like a fight\n\nTo take back your life\n\n\n\nSearching for the meaning\n\nI'm living in these feelings\n\nI'm ready for a reason to believe\n\nNow I'm working on my insides\n\n'Cause outside there's no reasoning\n\nIf anyone's here it's never what it seems\n\n\n\nHow long I waited\n\nFeeling lost, frustrated\n\nLocked out and I'm on my own\n\nCornered and ain't got no place to go\n\nHow long should I stay here all alone\n\n\n\nSearching for the meaning\n\nI'm living in these feelings\n\nI'm ready for a reason to believe\n\nNow I'm working on my insides\n\n'Cause outside there's no reasoning\n\nIf anyone's here it's never what it seems"
