  "lyrics": "I grew up here all of my life\r\nBut I dreamed someday I'd go\r\nWhere the blue-eyed girls\r\nAnd the red guitars\r\nAnd the naked rivers flow\n\nI'm not all I thought I'd be\n\nI've always stayed around\n\nI've been as far as Mercy and Grand\n\nFrozen to the ground\n\n\n\nI can't stay here\n\nAnd I'm scared to leave\n\nSo kiss me once and then\n\nI'll go to hell\n\nI might as well be\n\nWhistlin' down the wind\n\n\n\nThe bus is at the corner\n\nThe clock on the wall\n\nBroken down windmill\n\nThere ain't no wind at all\n\n\n\nAnd I yelled and I cursed\n\nIf I stay here I'll rust\n\nI'm stuck like a shipwreck\n\nOut here in the dust\n\n\n\nThe sky is red\n\nAnd the world is on fire\n\nAnd the corn is taller than me\n\nAnd the dog is tied to a wagon of rain\n\nAnd the road is wet as the sea\n\n\n\nSometimes the music from a dance\n\nWill carry across the plains\n\nThe places that I'm dreaming of\n\nDream only of your face\n\n\n\nThere are places where they never sleep\n\nAnd the circus never ends\n\n\n\nSo I will take the Marleybone coach\n\nAnd be whistlin' down the wind\n\nSo I will take the Marleybone coach\n\nAnd be whistlin' down the wind"
