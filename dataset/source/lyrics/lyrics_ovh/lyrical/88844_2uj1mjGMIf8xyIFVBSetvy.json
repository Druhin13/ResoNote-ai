  "lyrics": "I hear the ticking of the clock\r\nI'm lying here the room's pitch dark\r\nI wonder where you are tonight\r\nNo answer on the telephone\r\nAnd the night goes by so very slow\r\nOh I hope that it won't end though\n\nAlone\n\n\n\nTill now I always got by on my own\n\nI never really cared until I met you\n\nAnd now it chills me to the bone\n\nHow do I get you alone\n\nHow do I get you alone\n\n\n\nYou don't know how long I have wanted\n\nTo touch your lips and hold you tight, oh\n\nYou don't know how long I have waited\n\nand I was going to tell you tonight\n\nBut the secret is still my own\n\nand my love for you is still unknown\n\nAlone\n\nTill now I always got by on my own\n\nI never really cared until I met you\n\nAnd now it chills me to the bone\n\nHow do I get you alone\n\nHow do I get you alone\n\n\n\nHow do I get you alone\n\nHow do I get you alone\n\nAlone, alone"
