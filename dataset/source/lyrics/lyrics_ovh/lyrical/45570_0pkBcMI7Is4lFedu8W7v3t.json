A high Joker like a Spades game\n\nKeeping both eyes open wide rain man\n\nCrew high on that fuck your life drank man\n\nWe slide in the bucket like paint\n\nNever gave a fuck, fuck what you might think\n\nRan up in the club 'till they sent the lights in\n\nHad to tell the owner please let the lights dim\n\nFive more minutes see me a nice slim\n\nThick bitch with the you me and my grin\n\nTell her bring the crew you me and my friends\n\nSee where the night end with the right guy\n\nTrust me and my kin, speak with the right pen\n\nCreep like the lightning in the night sky\n\nGo deep Janet Jackson, we back to back in\n\nBlack SUV's, black tints would you look at that?\n\nI'm booby trapped in your fluid black skin\n\nNo groupie action, your bougie accent\n\nYou're truly classic, girl we outta here\n\n\n\nBas, it's Bassy\n\nQueens nigga with the Fiends nigga\n\nGot the bean waitin' in the pocket ooh\n\n\n\nI asked P, what's poppin'?\n\nHe said we are nigga, trips to DR nigga\n\nGot the borough jumpin' like it's J.R. Smith\n\nKnow a couple niggas' let the A-R spit\n\nGot no interest what you say y'all did\n\nOnly where y'all live\n\nSmokin' blunts 'cause that's the way I live\n\nAnd where I live?\n\nNiggas dyin' front of their shorty, wives\n\nAnd their brother's ride on the other side\n\nEvery death is like a 100 lives\n\nFlatlined from the black nine\n\nI could feel the pressure multiplying\n\nMake you feel like ain't no hope in trying\n\nBut we always trying\n\nAll this blood I bet it float to sea and wash out\n\n'Cause they don't want you to see but watch out\n\nNigga watch out\n\n\n\nSee I want you to see\n\nI've been through so many things\n\nThings ain't always what they seem\n\nHope you get the message\n\nI hope you figure it out\n\nNow I'm right where I belong\n\nHad to let it go\n\nAll the pain I was holding on\n\nNow I get the message\n\nI had to figure it out\n\n\n\nYou got to feel the music, do you understand?\n\nIt takes you higher and higher"
