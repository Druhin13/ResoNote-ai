  "lyrics": "Every time I think of you\r\nI feel shot right through with a bolt of blue\r\nIt's no problem of mine\r\nBut it's a problem I find\r\nLiving a life that I can't leave behind\r\nBut there's no sense in telling me\n\nThe wisdom of the fool won't set you free\n\nBut that's the way that it goes\n\nAnd it's what nobody knows\n\nWell every day my confusion grows\n\n\n\nEvery time I see you falling\n\nI get down on my knees and pray\n\nI'm waiting for that final moment\n\nYou say the words that I can't say\n\n\n\nI feel fine and I feel good\n\nI'm feeling like I never should\n\nWhenever I get this way\n\nI just don't know what to say\n\nWhy can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday\n\nI'm not sure what this could mean\n\nI don't think you're what you seem\n\nI do admit to myself\n\nThat if I hurt someone else\n\nThen I'll never see just what we're meant to be\n\n\n\nEvery time I see you falling\n\nI get down on my knees and pray\n\nI'm waiting for that final moment\n\nYou say the words that I can't say\n\nEvery time I see you falling\n\nI get down on my knees and pray\n\nI'm waiting for that final moment\n\nYou say the words that I can't say\n\nEvery time I see you falling\n\nI get down on my knees and pray\n\nI'm waiting for that final moment\n\nYou say the words that I can't say\n\nEvery time I see you falling\n\nI get down on my knees and pray\n\nI'm waiting for that final moment\n\nYou say the words that I can't say"
