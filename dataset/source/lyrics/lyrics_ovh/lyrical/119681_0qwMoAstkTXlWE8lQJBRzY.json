  "lyrics": "The storm is rolling in\r\nThunder shakes the bones beneath my skin\r\nRain pours through\r\nThe heavens open\r\nLift me up\r\nKneel before me\n\n\n\nI bring the light into the ground, kneel before me\n\n\n\nThe world is falling in\n\nFrom its childrens' insatiable sin\n\nTo cleanse and clean\n\nOr start this over\n\nBring to me\n\nA new world order\n\n\n\nHeavy is the crown on the road I walk\n\nThe vultures circle and the sheep they talk\n\nI pray for a strain against the pain I bring\n\nWorking off on balance\n\nBetween God and king\n\n\n\nI bring the light into the ground, kneel before me"
