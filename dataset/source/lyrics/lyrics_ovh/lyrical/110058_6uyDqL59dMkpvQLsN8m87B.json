  "lyrics": "Wadin' through the waste stormy winter, \nAnd there's not a friend to help you through. \nTryin' to stop the waves behind your eyeballs, \nDrop your reds, drop your greens and blues. \nThank you for your wine, California, \n\nThank you for your sweet and bitter fruits. \n\nYes I got the desert in my toenail \n\nAnd I hid the speed inside my shoe. \n\n\n\nI want you to come on, come on down Sweet Virginia, \n\nI want you come on, honey child, I beg of you. \n\nI want you come on, come on down, you got it in you. \n\nGot to scrape the shit right off you shoes. \n\n\n\nBut Come on, come on down Sweet Virginia, \n\nCome on, honey child, I beg of you. \n\nCome on, come on down, you got it in you. \n\nGot to scrape that shit right off you shoes. \n\n\n\nBut come on, come on down Sweet Virginia, \n\nCome on, honey child, I beg of you. \n\nCome on, come on down, you got it in you. \n\nGot to scrape that shit right off you shoes."
