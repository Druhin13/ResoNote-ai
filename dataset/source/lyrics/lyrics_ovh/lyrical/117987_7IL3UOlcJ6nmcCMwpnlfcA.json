  "lyrics": "Loving you, I thought I couldn’t get no higher\r\nYour November rain could set the night on fire, night on fire\r\nBut we could only burn so long\r\nCounterfeit emotions only run skin deep\r\nKnow you're lying when you're lying next to me, next to me\n\nHow did we get so far gone?\n\nI should know by now, you should know by now\n\nWe should know by now\n\n\n\nSomething's gotta give, something's gotta break\n\nBut all I do is give and all you do is take\n\nSomething’s gotta change, but I know that it won’t\n\nNo reason to stay is a good reason to go\n\nIs a good reason to go\n\n\n\nI have never heard a silence quite so loud\n\nI walk in the room and you don't make a sound, make a sound\n\nYou're good at making me feel small\n\nIf it doesn't hurt me, why do I still cry?\n\nIf it didn't kill me, then I'm half alive, half alive\n\n\n\nHow did we get so far gone?\n\nI should know by now, you should know by now\n\nWe should know by now\n\n\n\nSomething's gotta give, something's gotta break\n\nBut all I do is give and all you do is take\n\nSomething’s gotta change, but I know that it won’t\n\nNo reason to stay is a good reason to go\n\nIs a good reason to go\n\n\n\nI should know by now, you should know by now\n\nI think I'm breaking right now\n\nI should know by now, you should know by now\n\nI think I'm breaking right now\n\n\n\nSomething's gotta give, something's gotta break\n\nBut all I do is give and all you do is take\n\nSomething’s gotta change, but I know that it won’t\n\nNo reason to stay is a good reason to go\n\nIs a good reason to go\n\nSomething's gotta give"
