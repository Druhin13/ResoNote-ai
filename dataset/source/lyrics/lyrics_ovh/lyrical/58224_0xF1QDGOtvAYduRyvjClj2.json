  "lyrics": "It kept me up much too late\r\nKept me up for three days\r\nLeft me in a storm at sea\r\nInvisible to eyesight\r\nSurrounded me in spotlight\r\nBeen moving around for three whole years\n\n\n\nSaid \"Hey you're too exposed,\n\nEnemies are getting close,\n\nThey'll be round to take you away\"\n\nSo tell your soul to sing\n\nAnd sing along with anything\n\nIt might be much too late\n\n\n\nThere's an angel underneath my skin\n\nWake me up and teach my soul to sing\n\n\n\nI think I found a reason\n\nI want to start believing\n\n'Cause somebody alive's up here\n\nThose superstitious evils\n\nCan stay with other people\n\nMe? I don't have too much fear\n\n\n\nI've got my whole life coming on\n\nI've got my whole life coming on\n\nI've got my whole life\n\n\n\nThere's an angel underneath my skin\n\nWake me up and teach my soul to sing\n\nThere's an angel underneath my skin\n\nWake me up, wake me up, wake me up"
