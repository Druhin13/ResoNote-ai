  "lyrics": "So I always get nostalgic with that song\r\nBut in my room it's forced\r\nIt has to be in some car across the street\r\nAnd I always catch the back of your head in a crowd\r\n(Just) don't turn around\r\nt's never you and you ruin those memories\n\nAnd those photos are great if I catch Ã¢??em with the sun of\n\nmy eye\n\nBut if I stare\n\n(It) just turns into you and me\n\nWe're just standin' there\n\nAnd now it's over\n\nWould you hear me\n\nScream at the top of my lungs\n\nAnd when you go there\n\nWould you hear me\n\nScream at the top of my lungs\n\nSo I always fool my friends and we head down there\n\nYou think that we are rude/en route\n\nWe just drove past your old house and you weren't there\n\nAnd I'm always great when I'm hangin' with your buds\n\nan' they lie\n\nThey think that I'm just fine\n\nIt's always been that way\n\nJust a \"Pocketbook Brando\"\n\nAnd when you hold him\n\nWould you hear me\n\nScream at the top of my lungs\n\nYou love my whisper\n\nBut did you hear me\n\nScream at the top of my lungs\n\nSo you crank that song\n\nAnd it might sound doom\n\nSo just leave the room\n\nWhile I sit an' stare\n\nCause this is rare\n\nI really love that tune\n\nMan, I love that song\n\nI really love that song\n\nI love that song\n\nSo when you go there\n\nWould you hear me\n\nScream at the top of my lungs\n\nAnd [when you're hated/Would you hate it\n\nWould you hear me\n\nScream at the top of my lungs\n\nSo you crank that song\n\nAnd it might sound doom\n\nSo just leave the room\n\nWhile I sit an' stare\n\nCause yeah, that's rare\n\nI really love that tune\n\nMan, I love that song\n\nI love that song\n\nI love that song"
