  "lyrics": "When I scream at the top of my lungs\r\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\r\nBegging to cut me loose\r\nAnd you're holding the knife\r\nI'm drowning under the surface\n\nYou left me broke and bruised\n\nBegging for my life\n\nWhat did I do to deserve this?\n\n\n\nYou make me feel like I am worthless\n\nWhy can't I stop the bleeding?\n\n\n\nWhen I scream at the top of my lungs\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\nWhen I scream \"What have I become?\"\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\n\n\nI'm hanging from the noose\n\nFighting to stay alive\n\nI'm crawling back to the surface\n\nCan't take much more abuse\n\nDon't know if I'll survive\n\nI did nothing to deserve this\n\n\n\nYou make me feel like I am worthless\n\nWhy can't I stop the bleeding?\n\n\n\nWhen I scream at the top of my lungs\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\nWhen I scream \"What have I become?\"\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\n\n\nFalling for you is my biggest regret\n\nThe harder I love you, the sicker I get\n\nWhen I scream at the top of my lungs\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\n\n\nI'm not worthless\n\n\n\nWhen I scream at the top of my lungs\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\nWhen I scream \"What have I become?\"\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?\n\n\n\nFalling for you is my biggest regret\n\nThe harder I love you, the sicker I get\n\nWhen I scream from the top of my lungs\n\nDo you love me? Do you love me?"
