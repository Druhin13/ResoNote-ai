  "lyrics": "Sometimes that lake got angry, as the lightnin' went and crashed\r\nSometimes it was so still, it looked like a sheet of glass\r\nBut it washed away our beer cans, and it washed away our sins\r\nIt talked us out of all our clothes, and begged us to jump in\r\nThere was magic in the summer water\n\nLearned to swim in the summer water\n\nAll the small town sons and daughters\n\nWere baptized a thousand times\n\nBuilt fire by it like an altar\n\nGave it every song we could offer\n\nMemories float on it like a bobber\n\nOut there on the summer water\n\n\n\nWhen a heart was broken, it was better than a church pew sanctuary\n\nA lot of long kiss, rocks skip, sun drenched orange crush bottle caps got buried\n\nIt's where you spend your first night with your first love before the mercury starts fallin'\n\nIt's where you spend the last with your first love, before somebody goes to college\n\n\n\nThere was magic in the summer water\n\nLearned to swim in the summer water\n\nAll the small town sons and daughters\n\nWere baptized a thousand times\n\nBuilt fire by it like an altar\n\nGave it every song we could offer\n\nMemories float on it like a bobber\n\nOut there on the summer water\n\n\n\nThere was somethin' 'bout the summer water\n\nEvery girl that's where you brought her\n\nIt's where you slipped that ring you bought her\n\nOn her shakin' hand\n\nBuilt fire by it like an altar\n\nGave it every song we could offer\n\nMemories float on it like a bobber\n\nOut there on the summer water\n\n\n\nYeah out on the summer water"
