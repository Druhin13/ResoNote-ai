  "lyrics": "Sometimes I feel so small, yeah\r\nLike a picture on your wall, yeah\r\nLike I'm hanging on just to fall, yeah\r\nNo matter how I try\r\nSo love sing to me gentle\n\nThat I'm more than just accidental\n\nMore than just inconsequential\n\nBurning out tonight\n\n\n\nAll I need is the air I breathe\n\nThe time we share and the ground beneath my feet\n\nAll I need is the love that I believe in\n\nTell me love, do you believe in me?\n\n\n\nThere's a place down by the ocean\n\nWhere I take my mixed emotions\n\nWhen my soul's rocked by explosions\n\nOf these tired times (tired times)\n\nWhere love sings to me slowly\n\nEven when I feel low and lonely\n\nEven when the road feels like\n\nThe only friend of mine\n\n\n\nAll I need is the air I breathe\n\nThe time we share and the ground beneath my feet\n\nAll I need is the love that I believe in\n\nTell me love, do you believe in me?\n\n\n\nOh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh\n\nOh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-ohh\n\n\n\nOne light, one goal\n\nOne feeling in my soul\n\nOne fight, one hope\n\nOne twisting rope\n\nI'm ready to run where the ocean meets the sky\n\n\n\nWhere all I need is the air I breathe\n\nThe time we share and the ground beneath my feet\n\nAll I need is the love that I believe in\n\nTell me love, do you believe in me?\n\nAll I need is the air I breathe\n\nThe time we share and the ground beneath my feet\n\nAll I need is the love that I believe in\n\nTell me love, do you believe in me?\n\n\n\nTell me love, 'cause you're all I need"
