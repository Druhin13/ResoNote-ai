  "lyrics": "Well Sunday morning\r\nIt came without warning\r\nAfter another sad Saturday night\r\nNo understanding\r\nHer changing plans and\r\nI'm way too weak to fight\n\n\n\nStrangers' faces on this crowded street\n\nThey all turn away when they, they look at me\n\nThey don't wanna see these tears in my eyes\n\nBut there ain't no good place to cry\n\n\n\nSo I found my way\n\nDown to Lower Broadway\n\nWhere nobody knows my name\n\nI was just another fool\n\nSittin' down there on another stool\n\nWith another woman to blame\n\n\n\nI don't want to share my story\n\nAnd more of the same old blues, they bore me\n\nI just need to find a good place to hide\n\n'Cause there ain't no good place to cry\n\n\n\nAnd I don't want anyone to see\n\nAnd I don't want anyone to pity me\n\nSo I might have to walk these streets all night\n\n'Cause there ain't no good place to cry\n\nOh there ain't no good place to cry"
