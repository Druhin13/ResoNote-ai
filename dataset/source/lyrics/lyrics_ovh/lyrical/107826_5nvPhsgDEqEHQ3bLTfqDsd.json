  "lyrics": "So long since I put my feet\r\nOn this steady ground I used to call my town\r\nYou lived on my favorite street\r\nWhere the thieves would lurk and dream of calling home\r\nAnd now that I'm here again\n\nEverything looks the same\n\nBut there's not a doubt that something's not the way it was\n\n\n\nIt's like you've got new eyes on me\n\nEating up my body\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nWhat is it you see?\n\nThe whole night you've been different, you're acting kind of crazy\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me\n\n\n\nAnd I go with the thought of your touch\n\nWhen the darkness drowns and brings us to the deep\n\nJust keep those eyes on and we'll find our way up\n\nWhen I come back I'll meet you on the street\n\n\n\nAnd we will be here again\n\nAnd It still looks just the same\n\nBut there's not a doubt about it, everything has changed\n\n\n\nIt's like you've got new eyes on me\n\nEating up my body\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nWhat is it you see?\n\nThe whole night you've been different, you're acting kind of crazy\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me\n\n\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me\n\n\n\nAnd I long for those summer nights\n\nFeels like everything was better then\n\nNow I see you in the city lights\n\nTaking me home\n\n\n\nIt's like you've got new eyes on me\n\nEating up my body\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nWhat is it you see?\n\nThe whole night you've been different, you're acting kind of crazy\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me (oh)\n\n\n\nIt's like you've got new eyes on me\n\nEating up my body\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nWhat is it you see?\n\nThe whole night you've been different, you're acting kind of crazy\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me\n\n\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me\n\nLike you've got new eyes on me\n\nYou've got new eyes on me"
