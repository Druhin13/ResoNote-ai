  "lyrics": "Iron-clad feather-feet pounding the dust, \nAn October's day, towards evening, \nSweat embossed veins standing proud to the plough, \nSalt on a deep chest seasoning. \nLast of the line at an honest day's toil, \nTurning the deep sod under, \n\nFlint at the fetlock, chasing the bone, \n\nFlies at the nostrils plunder. \n\n\n\nThe Suffolk, the Clydesdale, the Percheron Vie \n\nwith the Shire on his feathers floating. \n\nHauling soft timber into the dusk \n\nto bed on a warm straw coating. \n\n\n\nHeavy Horses, move the land under me. \n\nBehind the plough gliding slipping and sliding free. \n\nNow you're down to the few \n\nAnd there's no work to do: \n\nThe tractor's on its way. \n\n\n\nLet me find you a filly for your proud stallion seed \n\nto keep the old line going. \n\nAnd we'll stand you abreast at the back of the wood \n\nbehind the young trees growing. \n\nTo hide you from eyes that mock at your girth, \n\nand your eighteen hands at the shoulder. \n\nAnd one day when the oil barons have all dripped dry \n\nand the nights are seen to draw colder \n\nthey'll beg for your strength, your gentle power \n\nyour noble grace and your bearing. \n\nAnd you'll strain once again to the sound of the gulls \n\nin the wake of the deep plough, sharing. \n\n\n\nStanding like tanks on the brow of the hill \n\nUp into the cold wind facing \n\nIn stiff battle harness, chained to the world \n\nAgainst the low sun racing. \n\nBring me a wheel of oaken wood \n\nA rein of polished leather \n\nA Heavy Horse and a tumbling sky \n\nBrewing heavy weather. \n\n\n\nBring a song for the evening \n\nClean brass to flash the dawn \n\nacross these acres glistening \n\nlike dew on a carpet lawn. \n\nIn these dark towns folk lie sleeping \n\nas the heavy horses thunder by \n\nto wake the dying city \n\nwith the living horseman's cry. \n\n\n\nAt once the old hands quicken, \n\nbring pick and wisp and curry comb, \n\nthrill to the sound of all \n\nthe heavy horses coming home."
