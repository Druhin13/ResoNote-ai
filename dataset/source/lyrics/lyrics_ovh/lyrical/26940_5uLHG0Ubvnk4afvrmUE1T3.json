  "lyrics": "It's an impossible dream but you realise\r\nYou're not waking up\r\nWatch as the silence and protest fails us\r\nHigher than reason and brighter than light\r\nGravity no longer wins\r\nIt's an impossible thought, so you theorise\n\n\n\nThis is what the resurrection feels like\n\nFrom the other side\n\n\n\nIt's an improbable scheme but we tow along\n\nAnd no one iquires\n\nCan we be this ugly and still have a beautiful life\n\nBe a beautiful wife?\n\n'Cause I'm a believer and I'm not a fool\n\n\n\nIs this what the resurrection feels like?\n\nIs this just what the resurrection feels like\n\nFrom the other side, from the other side, from the other side?\n\n\n\nIs this what the resurrection feels like?\n\nIs this just what the resurrection feels like\n\nFrom the other side, from the other side, from the other side?\n\nOut of the darker day and into the brighter night\n\nFrom the other side, from the other side, from the other side\n\nOut of the darker day and into the brighter night\n\n\n\nIs this what the resurrection feels like?\n\nIs this what the resurrection feels like\n\nFrom the other side, from the other side, from the other side?\n\n\n\nThe lighter the friction, the louder the sound\n\nWe'll all hear the roar when the walls hit the ground"
