  "lyrics": "I'm passing sleeping cities \nFading by degrees \nNot believing all I see to be so \nI'm flyin' over backyards \nCountry homes and ranches \n\nWatching life between the branches below \n\n\n\nAnd it's hard to say \n\nWho you are these days \n\nBut you run on anyway \n\nDon't you baby? \n\n\n\nYou keep running for another place \n\nTo find that saving grace \n\n\n\nI'm moving on alone over ground that no one owns \n\nPast statues that atone for my sins \n\nThere's a guard on every door \n\nAnd a drink on every floor \n\nOverflowing with a thousand amens \n\n\n\nAnd it's hard to say \n\nWho you are these days \n\nBut you run on anyway \n\nDon't you baby? \n\n\n\nYou keep running for another place \n\nTo find that saving grace \n\nDon't you baby? \n\n\n\nYou're rolling up the carpet \n\nOf your father's two-room mansion \n\nNo headroom for expansion no more \n\nAnd there's a corner of the floor \n\nThey're telling you is yours \n\nYou're confident but not really sure \n\n\n\nAnd it's hard to say \n\nWho you are these days \n\nBut you run on anyway \n\nDon't you baby? \n\n\n\nYou keep running for another place \n\nTo find that saving grace \n\n\n\nDon't you baby? \n\n\n\nYou keep running for another place \n\nto find that saving grace \n\n\n\nDon't you baby?"
