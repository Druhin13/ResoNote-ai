  "lyrics": "Get it\r\nOh shit\r\nLines cut like a machete swing\r\nTimes up, before they set the [?]\r\nDeadly with the pen I bring, the chemistry is menacing\n\nLike what? Like Ben Mendehlson in anything\n\nLet me be Frank, like Bernthal at a casting call\n\nPunish cats like Kyrie, mask and all\n\nI'm like a 2017 Gordon Hayward 'cause I don't play\n\nBut I'm okay, I rock the rappers like Chipotle\n\nI hope they get their shit together\n\n'Cause the raps they give are somethin' like a laxative, whatever\n\nThe reigning adjective to describe the way I tear the mic with a vengeance\n\nUnless I gotta be that guy and use 'erudite' in a sentence\n\nNah, these haters can't compete\n\nThey pray to God I'm fake but I'm real like a Trump tweet (damn)\n\nMy life look like Able's gun, it's never set to stun, you better run\n\n(What you mean by, \"It never set on stun?\")\n\nY'know\n\n(It's supposed to be on stun, get yourself hurt, son)\n\nLet me break it down, I grown since mic mastery\n\nSometimes I'll reach like [?] on D\n\n[?] I met a human stand tall like Ewing\n\nLine seperate like the opening crawl on the first viewing\n\nPursuin' Illinois, Sufjan Stevens\n\nEven though he's an Asthmatic Kitty, he's too calm breathin'\n\nRippin' crews like Rotten Tomato reviews of The Mummy\n\nI'm ballin' like I'm hoopin' for money, who want it from me?\n\nI'll wait, style great, while your shit's weak, pipsqueek\n\nMake me wanna mute you like when Steven A. Smith speak\n\nSo ahead of my time when I send savagery\n\nThe link won't expire until after the singularity\n\nBeen tellin' ya'll now you seein' what I mean and shit\n\nJohn Williams still workin' on my theme and shit\n\n(Yo yo yo)\n\nFind a better place\n\nIt's Esoteric wreakin' havoc with the metal face\n\n(That's game, don't play it out\n\n[?], get out)\n\nI heard you talkin' 'bout me, man\n\n(hahahaha)"
