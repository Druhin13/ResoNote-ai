  "lyrics": "Where ever I go I am ready\r\n'Cause I know you been through the worst\r\nI know it's dark, but don't you worry\r\nIf I know love, it shouldn't hurt\r\nHold on tight in the waves with me now\n\nWhen the lights go, the lights go down\n\nYou'll be safe, you'll be sound\n\nHold on tight, would you wave with me now?\n\nWhen the night come, the night come\n\nI'll keep you safe, keep you sound\n\nHold on tight\n\nHold on tight\n\nHold on tight\n\n\n\nWe are strong, we are steady\n\nWe won't fall in the rain\n\nI hold your head when you're hurting\n\nWe all love, but we're scared of faith\n\n\n\nHold on tight in the waves with me now\n\nWhen the lights go, the lights go down\n\nYou'll be safe, you'll be sound\n\nHold on tight, would you wave with me now?\n\nWhen the night come, the night come\n\nI'll keep you safe, keep you sound\n\nHold on tight\n\nHold on tight\n\nHold on tight\n\n\n\nHold on tight in the waves with me now\n\nWhen the lights go, the lights go down\n\nYou'll be safe, you'll be sound\n\nHold on tight, would you wave with me now?\n\nWhen the night come, the night come\n\nI'll keep you safe, keep you sound\n\nHold on tight\n\nHold on tight\n\nHold on tight"
