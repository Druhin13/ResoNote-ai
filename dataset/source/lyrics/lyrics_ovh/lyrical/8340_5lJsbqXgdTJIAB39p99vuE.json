  "lyrics": "Drinking from the steaming street\r\nFilling up my lungs with heat\r\nBreathing out all that anger\r\nTrying to find some inner peace\r\nChannels trying to run me down\n\nTelling me it ain’t my town\n\nMean it as it may\n\nI’m cashing in my favor now\n\n\n\nHid it in the basement\n\nGotta keep it safe somehow\n\n\n\nBut it’s really quite a shame that it’s gone to waste\n\nI was hoping to bring some home\n\nAs I slowly roller-skate through a wall of hate\n\nI was hoping to save my soul, but what’s it for?\n\n\n\nJumping down that hill again\n\nBodied by the Russian wind\n\nLet her reach the engine\n\nWonder why the light’s so dim\n\n\n\nListen to your roommates honk\n\nDown the hall as I woke up\n\nChin aches on my hardwood\n\nThink I’ll pour myself a cup\n\n\n\nSister for the weekend\n\nLove you still when Monday comes\n\n\n\nBut it’s really quite a shame that it’s gone to waste\n\nI was starting to feel so cold\n\nFeel like everyday’s such a piece of cake\n\nI was trying to bring some home\n\nAs I slowly roller-skate through a wall of hate\n\nI was hoping to save my soul, but what’s it for?"
