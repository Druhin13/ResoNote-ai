  "lyrics": "When your' out there on your own \nWhere your memories can find you \nLike a circle goes around \nYou were lost until you found out \nWhat it all comes down to \nOne by one the lonely feelings come\n\nDay by day they slowly fade away \n\nOoh, the look was in her eyes \n\nYou never know what might be found there \n\nShe was dancin' right in time \n\nAnd the moves she made so fine \n\nLike the music that surrounds her \n\nShould I stay or go ? I really want to know \n\nWould I lose or win \n\nIf I try and love again \n\nOh gonna try and love again \n\nOh gonna try and love again \n\nOh gonna try and love again \n\nRight or wrong what's done is done\n\nIt's only moments that we borrow \n\nBut the thoughts will linger on \n\nOf the lady and her song \n\nWhen the sun comes up tomorrow \n\nWell it might take years \n\nTo see through all these tears \n\nDon't let go, when you find it you will know \n\nOh gonna try and love again \n\nOh gonna try and love again \n\nOh gonna try and love again"
