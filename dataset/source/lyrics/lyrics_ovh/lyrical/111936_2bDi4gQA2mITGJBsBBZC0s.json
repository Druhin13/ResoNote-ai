  "lyrics": "Even when the rain falls\r\nEven when the flood starts rising\r\nEven when the storm comes\r\nI am washed by the water\r\nDaddy was a preacher\n\nShe was his wife\n\nJust tryin to make the world a little better\n\nYou know, shine a light\n\nPeople started talking\n\nTrying to hear their own voice\n\nThose people tried to accuse my father\n\nSaid he made the wrong choice\n\nThough it might be painful\n\nYou know that time will always tell\n\nThose people have long since gone\n\nMy father never failed\n\n\n\nEven if the Earth crumbles under my feet\n\nEven if the ones I love turn around and crucify me\n\nI won't never ever let you down\n\nI won't fall\n\nI won't fall\n\nI won't fall as long as you're around me"
