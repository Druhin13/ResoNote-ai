  "lyrics": "See in a world when you fall and sometimes get stuck\r\nYou have to rise to the moment and pick yourself up\r\nBe a student and learn when life gets you down\r\nAnd a teacher to show others how to turn it around\r\nYou can make 'em all proud when it's your time to shine\r\nAnd go for the top when it's yours for the climb\n\nWe can do it together if that's what it takes\n\nBut having faith in yourself makes you one of the greats\n\n\n\nWe are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nWe got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nOh-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\nOh-whoa\n\nWe are one, one, one\n\nWe are one, one, one\n\n\n\nThe goal is always success and we're pushing for first\n\nBut not fighting it at all never quenches the thirst\n\nThere's a hunger inside and it's screaming for change\n\nSo give it your best when you're up at the [?]\n\nSwing baby swing and aim for the sky\n\nNo one's holding you back, if you want it just fly\n\nThis is your life so make it your dream\n\nTogether we are one, forever a team\n\n\n\nWe are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nWe got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nOh-whoa-whoa-whoa\n\nOh-whoa\n\nWe are one, one, one\n\nWe are one, one, one\n\n\n\nWe are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nWe got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\n\n\nWe are strong, we are brave, we might bend, we won't break\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nWe got hope, we got heart, we won't stop, we'll go hard\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\n\n\nWe are strong, we are brave\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\n\n\nWe got hope, we got heart\n\nWe are one, we are one\n\nWe are one, we are one"
