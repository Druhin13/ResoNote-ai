  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Forgot How To Dream par Ekali\r\nWhy can't I be myself when I'm by myself?\nI'm only nervous alone, what did I settle for?\nJust a metaphor of something that felt like a home\nBlack ivy, I'm so lost, come find me wandering\nUsed to be reliable, now I'm liable\nFor promises I couldn't keep\nI was a little kid, I was different\nThe world is alive as I sleep\nAll day eyes shut, my mind just stays blank\n\nGuess I forgot how to dream\nGuess I forgot how to dream\n\nThink that I'm losing it, I'm confusing things\nThat I used to keep in a line\n\nWhy can't I trust myself, learn to love myself?\nThey say it's a sign of the times\nDon't leave me, oh my mind won't stay easy, easy\nI've been along for the ride, but I haven't been driving\nHaven't used my eyes in a minute, swear I'm sincere\nBut the weed and the Internet clouded my vision\nThese lights make it hard just to sit in or live in the skin that I got\nTurned into something I'm not\nI'm looking at photos of people looking at the clock\n\nGuess I forgot how to dream\nGuess I forgot how to dream\n\nGuess I forgot how to dream\n\nGuess I forgot how to dream"
