  "lyrics": "What you want is a deep cut\r\nWhat you feel is your skin just brushed\r\nWhat you need is a new start\r\nWhat you get as it falls hard\r\nMake something you can feel\n\nDon't get caught up in what's not real\n\nMake something you can feel\n\nDon't get caught up in our deal\n\n\n\nWhat you want is a deep mark\n\nAn indentation you feel in your heart\n\nWhat you need is a new key\n\nSomething to set your mind free\n\n\n\nMake something I can feel\n\nDon't get caught up in what's not real\n\nMake something I can feel\n\nDon't get caught up in our deal\n\n\n\nMake something you can feel\n\nDon't get caught up in what's not real\n\nA make a mark that is pure joy\n\nMake a start that time won't destroy"
