  "lyrics": "There's a \"For Sale\" sign on a big old rusty tractor.\r\nYou can't miss it, it's the first thing that you see.\r\nJust up the road, a pale-blue water tower,\r\nWith \"I Love Jenny\" painted in bright green.\r\nHey, that's my Uncle Bill, there by the courthouse.\r\nHe'll be lowerin' the flag when the sun goes down.\n\nAnd this is my town.\n\n\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nYeah, this is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nHey!\n\nWhere I was born, where I was raised.\n\nWhere I keep all my yesterdays.\n\nWhere I ran off 'cos I got mad,\n\nAn' it came to blows with my old man.\n\nWhere I came back to settle down,\n\nIt's where they'll put me in the ground:\n\nThis is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nYeah, this is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nMy town.\n\n\n\nThere ain't much goin' on here since they closed the mill.\n\nBut that whistle still blows ev'ry day at noon.\n\nA bunch of us still go down to the diner.\n\nI wonder if that interstate's still comin' through.\n\nCome Sunday morning service, at the Church of Christ,\n\nWell there ain't an empty seat to be found.\n\nAnd this is my town.\n\n\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nYeah, this is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nWhere I was born, where I was raised.\n\nWhere I keep all my yesterdays.\n\nWhere I ran off 'cos I got mad,\n\nAn' it came to blows with my old man.\n\nWhere I came back to settle down,\n\nIt's where they'll put me in the ground:\n\nThis is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nYeah, this is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nMy town.\n\n\n\nWell, I bought and painted up that rusty tractor.\n\nYou can't miss it, it's sittin' right there in our yard.\n\nThe County came and took that water tower,\n\nAnd that's Jenny, with a baby, in the car.\n\nAh, we're off to Sunday service at the Church of Christ,\n\nAnd if we want a seat, we better leave right now.\n\nAnd maybe later, me an old T-roy will show you around,\n\nOur town.\n\n\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nYeah, this is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nYeah, where I was born, where I was raised.\n\nWhere I keep all my yesterdays.\n\nWhere I ran off 'cos I got mad,\n\nAn' it came to blows with my old man.\n\nWhere I came back to settle down,\n\nIt's where they'll put me in the ground:\n\nThis is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\n\n\nYeah, this is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nThis is my town.\n\n(Na, na, na, na, na.)\n\nMy town."
