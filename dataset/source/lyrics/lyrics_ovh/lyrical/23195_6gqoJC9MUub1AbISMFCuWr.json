  "lyrics": "I think I know when to stop\r\nI know when love leaked out the bottom of our cup\r\n[?] when your warm embrace holds you like mine\r\nWhat you thinking you're gonna do now -\r\nIn the middle of the night?\n\nI just got too, I just got too empty\n\nI just got too, I just got too empty\n\n\n\nI feel like we're failing, I feel like I'm waiting on you\n\nThe reasons are locked, I feel like we're out of touch\n\nThe moment is fading, the moment is fading\n\nI feel like we fucked up, I feel like we lost our love\n\n\n\nI think we knew our time was up\n\nMy best day's too far away to keep this up\n\n[?] when your warm embrace holds you like mine\n\nWhat you thinking you're gonna do now -\n\nIn the middle of the night?\n\n\n\nI just got too, I just got too empty\n\nI just got too, I just got too empty\n\nI just got too, I just got too...\n\nI just got too, just got too...\n\n\n\nI feel like we're waiting, I feel like I'm failing you\n\nThe reasons are locked, I feel like we're out of touch\n\nThe moment is fading, the moment is fading\n\nI feel like we fucked up, I feel like we lost our love\n\nThe moment is fading, the moment is fading\n\nI feel like I'm waiting, I feel like I'm waiting\n\nI've been waiting..."
