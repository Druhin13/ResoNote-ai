  "lyrics": "Sleigh bells ring \nAre you listening \nIn the lane \nSnow is glistening \nA beautiful sight \nWe're happy tonight \n\nWalking in a winter wonderland \n\n\n\nGone away is the bluebird \n\nHere to stay is a new bird \n\nHe sings a love song \n\nAs we go along \n\nWalking in a winter wonderland \n\n\n\nIn the meadow we can build a snowman \n\nThen pretend that he is Parson Brown \n\nHe'll say, \"Are you married? \"\n\nWe'll say, \"No man\n\nBut you can do the job when you're in town \"\n\n\n\nLater on \n\nWe'll conspire\n\nAs we dream by the fire \n\nTo face unafraid \n\nThe plans that we've made \n\nWalking in a winter wonderland \n\nOh let's go walking\n\nYou know\n\n\n\nIn the meadow we can build a snowman \n\nAnd pretend that he's a circus clown \n\nWe'll have lots of fun with mister snowman\n\nUntil the other kiddies knock him down \n\n\n\nWhen it snows \n\nAin't it thrilling \n\nOh your nose gets a chilling \n\nWe'll frolic and play the Eskimo way \n\nWalking in a winter wonderland \n\nLook at you walking, come on\n\nWe'll frolic and play the Eskimo way \n\nWalking in a winter wonderland, oh let's go walking"
