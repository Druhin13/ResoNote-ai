  "lyrics": "I never knew my father was so broken [?]\r\nUntil the day I found my mother crying on the floor alone\r\nShe said \"How could he do this to me?\r\nHow could he do this to us?\r\nI thought we made a promise\r\nBut he said he broke my trust\"\n\n\n\nNow I'm left with these questions\n\n\n\nHave you ever been left alone in a broken home?\n\nHave you ever had to mediate for your parents sake?\n\nWhom we talk about love, talk about giving it up\n\nWhy are we innocent raised within conflict?\n\n\n\nI never knew that hearts could shatter just like broken glass\n\nTil you proved to me that love is fragile, cracked yours in half\n\nI just hope there's hope for me to stay home\n\nSo go ahead and call it off, go ahead and call it off\n\nIt's not just the fact that you're splitting up\n\nIt's that you're teaching me about giving up\n\n\n\nHave you ever been left alone in a broken home?\n\nHave you ever had to mediate for your parents sake?\n\nWhom we talk about love, talk about giving it up\n\nWhy are we innocent raised within conflict?\n\n\n\nSo I'm moving along now and\n\nI'll carry on trying the best that I can\n\nBecause of my father's sin\n\nYou blame your ashes on him\n\nGot in a war with him\n\nI'm so afraid of what's been going on\n\nI [?]\n\nThat on the other side I finally breath with no concern\n\nYou always shout to me for being me and now I see\n\n[?]\n\nAt age fourteen\n\n\n\nHave you ever been left alone in a broken home?\n\nHave you ever had to mediate for your parents sake?\n\nWhom we talk about love, talk about giving it up\n\nNow I'm left with these questions\n\nHave you ever been left alone in a broken home?\n\nHave you ever had to mediate for your parents sake?\n\nWhom we talk about love, talk about giving it up\n\nWhy are the innocent raised within conflict?"
