  "lyrics": "Is it just me or did the world stop spinning?\r\nI swear I felt it slowing down for a minute\r\nI know it sounds crazy, but looking at you, baby\r\nWith your summer hair that's falling down in slow motion\r\nYour body's swaying like a waves in the ocean\r\nI know, that you're thinking, exactly what I'm thinking\n\n\n\nIf I could go anywhere\n\nI wouldn't go anywhere\n\nI'm already there\n\n\n\nGirl, we ain't gotta leave this room\n\nTo make it feel like a honeymoon\n\nDon't need Cabo tan on your skin\n\nMy hands can still pretend\n\nGirl, we don't need a white sand beach\n\nWhen your lips get to kissing on me\n\nIt already feels like paradise\n\nWe'll take it nice and slow tonight\n\nLoving on island time\n\n\n\nAin't gotta worry about a beach bar closing\n\nI got a bottle of tequila we can open right here\n\nI'm just saying, it's like we're on vacation\n\n\n\nGirl, we ain't gotta leave this room\n\nTo make it feel like a honeymoon\n\nDon't need Cabo tan on your skin\n\nMy hands can still pretend\n\nGirl, we don't need a white sand beach\n\nWhen your lips get to kissing on me\n\nIt already feels like paradise\n\nWe'll take it nice and slow tonight\n\nLoving on island time\n\nLoving on island time, yeah\n\n\n\nIf I could go anywhere\n\nI wouldn't go anywhere\n\nI'm already there\n\n\n\nGirl, we ain't gotta leave this room\n\nTo make it feel like a honeymoon\n\nDon't need Cabo tan on your skin\n\nMy hands can still pretend\n\nGirl, we don't need a white sand beach\n\nWhen your lips get to kissing on me\n\nIt already feels like paradise\n\nWe'll take it nice and slow tonight\n\nLoving on island time\n\nLoving on island time"
