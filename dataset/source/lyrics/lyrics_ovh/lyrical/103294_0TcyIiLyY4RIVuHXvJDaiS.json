  "lyrics": "I was wrong\r\nAnd I'm sorry for that\r\nThings just haven't been the same\r\nSince I got my mind back\r\nAnd I try to hide the pain\r\nBut I'm never good at that\n\nYou can love me, you can hate me\n\nI just want my soul back\n\nAnd if there really is no God\n\nWho the fuck is in my head?\n\nPlanting seeds of deceit\n\nI guess this must be the end\n\nThey say the grass is always greener on the other side\n\nBut every time I try, I go colorblind\n\n\n\nI was wrong\n\nAnd I'm sorry for that\n\nThings just haven't been the same\n\nSince I got my mind back\n\nAnd I try to hide the pain\n\nBut I'm never good at that\n\nYou can love me, you can hate me\n\nI just want my soul back\n\nAnd if there really is no God\n\nWho the fuck is in my head?\n\nPlanting seeds of deceit\n\nI guess this must be the end\n\nThey say the grass is always greener on the other side\n\nBut every time I try, I go colorblind\n\n\n\nI've been having fucking trouble sleeping\n\nEvery thought, that's in my head\n\nIs telling me to lose my grip and just end it\n\nNo God to pray to, I have nothing left\n\nI thought this life was something more than itself\n\nI'm going crazy, can't trust myself\n\nSo please just let me go, and try to find hope\n\nIf I lose myself I know that I'll always be alone\n\n(Fuck)"
