  "lyrics": "Speak to me now\r\nWhen I’m asleep and there’s nobody to depend on me\r\nHold out your hand\r\n'Cause I’ve been drifting and sometimes I need some sympathy\r\nI tried to be what they want\n\nI lost myself, I lost my feet, I lost my memories\n\nNow in silence I wait\n\nI need your touch, I need your face, I need you\n\n\n\n'Cause I’m searching for a night light in the dark\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\nAnd I’m searching for the undiluted heart\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\n\n\nSo now it’s all come to this\n\nWhat was the purpose?\n\nI assumed that everything would pass\n\nI gave myself to the night\n\nI walked alone, I fell asleep on empty streets\n\n\n\nNow I see that\n\nAll this time my eyes were open\n\nAnd all this time I didn’t close them\n\nAnd the headlights play upon the ocean\n\nI will stay this way\n\n'Cause I see you, I see you now\n\n\n\nI’m searching for a night light in the dark\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\nI’m searching for the undiluted heart\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\nI’m hoping that somehow I’ll find my way\n\nTo a brighter love, a brighter love\n\nKeep hoping 'til the night straight falls apart\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I’m searching for a night light in the dark\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\nAnd I’m searching for the undiluted heart\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love\n\nI’m hoping that somehow I’ll find my way\n\nTo a brighter love, a brighter love\n\nKeep hoping 'til the night straight falls apart\n\nA brighter love, a brighter love"
