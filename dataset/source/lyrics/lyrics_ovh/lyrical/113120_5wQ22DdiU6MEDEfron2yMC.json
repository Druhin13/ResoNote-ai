  "lyrics": "Don't you wish that you could go back sometimes\r\nDon't you wish that you could go back home\r\nTryin' to remember just where it was\r\nRemember you ain't alone\r\nRemember you ain't alone\n\nEvery day's another pointless job\n\nAnd every night's another lonesome song\n\nTryin' to remember when your bed wasn't leather\n\nAnd you were the one singin' along\n\nLord, where did we go wrong\n\n\n\nNow the sky is coming down\n\nCan't you see the stars fallin'\n\nHave yourself another round\n\nTil' you can't hear the darkness callin'\n\nTil' you can't hear the darkness call you\n\n\n\nThere was a good man in the makin' once\n\nIn the light of yesterday\n\nTryin' to remember just who he was\n\nTryin' like hell to recall his name\n\nWell it used to be my name\n\n\n\nNow the sky is coming down\n\nCan't you see the stars fallin'\n\nHave yourself another round\n\nTil' you can't hear the darkness callin'\n\nTil' you can't hear the darkness call you"
