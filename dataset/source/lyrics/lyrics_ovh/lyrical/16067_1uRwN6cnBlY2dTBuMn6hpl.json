  "lyrics": "I trust in you for life to live, and air to breath. \nPurity fills my lungs. \nI no longer live in solitude.\r\nNo longer bound. \nMy heart beats with great devotion. \nThis is the start to a new beginning. \n\nOn my knees praying for mercy. \n\nHands raised high, humble and broken. Wanting your grace. \n\nWanting your security. \n\nMemories of laying facedown, motionless, with such a hollow feeling inside. \n\nSoon I would end this life I was living.\n\nI am just a man with a heart and sinful hands.\n\nI am a fallen victim. \n\nLord, show me the way. I ask of you Father, let my words be your words. \n\nLet my thoughts be your thoughts. \n\nTo you, I give my praise. \n\nShow me the way. Take me in your arms. Never let me go. \n\nLord, show me the way, as I give myself to you. \n\nNever let me go. \n\nHold me with your everlasting love. \n\nBe my strength. Be my voice. Be my glory. Set me free"
