  "lyrics": "In a time when men knew the meaning of fear\r\nAnd the tyrants of hell ruled the land and the seas\r\nThere lived one man who was true\r\nGuardian of secrets that only he knew\r\nCondemned for a crime that he did not commit\r\nSentenced to die in the depths of the pit\n\nHe swore he would take his revenge\n\nEvery laster traitor, their lives he would end\n\n\n\nWith the power of ale - He could not fail\n\n\n\nSail into battle, glory and metal\n\n\n\nHail! - Huntmaster\n\nRide! - Huntmaster\n\nFight! - Huntmaster\n\nDie! - Huntmaster\n\n\n\nUp from the bowels of hell he sailed\n\nWielding a tankard of freshly brewed ale\n\nSlaying all those in his path\n\nThose who might hinder his god-given task\n\nTo bring back beer to the lands of the free\n\nThis is his quest, his true destiny\n\nLegends shall speak of his name\n\nHail the Huntmaster, with honour and fame\n\n\n\nWith the power of ale - He could not fail\n\n\n\nSail into battle, glory and metal\n\n\n\nHail! - Huntmaster\n\nRide! - Huntmaster\n\nFight! - Huntmaster\n\nDie! - Huntmaster\n\n\n\nThis is the hunter's badge of glory\n\nThat he protects and tends his quarry\n\nHunts with honor, as is due\n\nAnd through the beast to the Gods is true"
