  "lyrics": "I was just a shepherd boy\r\nWithout a shield, without a sword\r\nFed up with the giant's voice\r\nScreaming curses to the Lord\r\nI walked down that hill alone\r\nWith a pocket full of river stones\n\nBut what that Philistine couldn't see\n\nIs what I had was more than me\n\nSee, on my own I'm weak\n\nBut my God fights for me!\n\n\n\nI was servant to the king\n\nInterpreting his crazy dreams\n\nI won't worship mortal men\n\nSo they threw me in the lion's den\n\nVicious teeth were all I saw\n\n'Til something came and shut their jaws\n\nYou couldn't find a scratch on me\n\nIn fact that night I fell asleep\n\nWhen morning came it shocked them all\n\n'Cause my God fights for me\n\nOh, yes, He does\n\n\n\nI stumbled into the room\n\nWith alabaster and my wounds\n\nI could feel their judging eyes\n\nAs I fell before the Christ\n\nI poured my oil upon His feet\n\nI didn't care who saw me weep\n\nI gave Him all I had that day\n\nAnd He should've sent me on my way\n\nBut instead, He lifted up my head\n\n'Cause my God fights for me, oh\n\n\n\nHe's my shield, He's my sword\n\nThe victory's the Lords\n\nHe's my shield, He's my sword\n\nThe victory's the Lords\n\n\n\nSo what's your story here today?\n\nWhat's the giant in your way?\n\nAre you trapped and can't get out?\n\nOr are you staring down a lion's mouth?\n\nCan you stand before the Lord?\n\nOr do you need to hit the floor?\n\nIt don't matter what you've done, uh\n\n'Cause the battle is already won\n\nSo lift your voice with me and sing\n\nThat \"My God fights for me!\" Oh, yeah\n\nSo lift your voice in victory\n\n'Cause \"My God fights for me!\""
