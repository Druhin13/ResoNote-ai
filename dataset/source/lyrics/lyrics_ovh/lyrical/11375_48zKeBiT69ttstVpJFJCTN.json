  "lyrics": "It was a slow day \nAnd the sun was beating \nOn the soldiers by the side of the road \nThere was a bright light \nA shattering of shop windows \nThe bomb in the baby carriage \n\nWas wired to the radio \n\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder \n\nThis is the long distance call \n\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo \n\nThe way we look to us all \n\nThe way we look to a distant constellation \n\nThat's dying in a corner of the sky \n\nTherse are the days of miracle and wonder \n\nAnd don't cry baby, don't cry \n\nDon't cry \n\n\n\nIt was a dry wind \n\nAnd it swept across the desert \n\nAnd it curled into the circle of birth \n\nAnd the dead sand \n\nFalling on the children \n\nThe mothers and the fathers \n\nAnd the automatic earth \n\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder \n\nThis is the long distance call \n\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo \n\nThe way we look to us all \n\nThe way we look to a distant constellation \n\nThat's dying in a corner of the sky \n\nTherse are the days of miracle and wonder \n\nAnd don't cry baby, don't cry \n\nDon't cry \n\n\n\nIt's a turn-around jump shot \n\nIt's everybody jump start \n\nIt's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts \n\nMedicine is magical and magical is art \n\nThe Boy in the Bubble \n\nAnd the baby with the baboon heart \n\n\n\nAnd I believe \n\nThese are the days of lasers in the jungle \n\nLasers in the jungle somewhere \n\nStaccato signals of constant information \n\nA loose affiliation of millionaires \n\nAnd billionaires and baby \n\nThese are the days of miracle and wonder \n\nThis is the long distance call \n\nThe way the camera follows us in slo-mo \n\nThe way we look to us all \n\nThe way we look to a distant constellation \n\nThat's dying in a corner of the sky \n\nTherse are the days of miracle and wonder \n\nAnd don't cry baby, don't cry \n\nDon't cry"
