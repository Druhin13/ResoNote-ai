Gonna remember the name\n\n\n\nI am your worst nightmare\n\nI'll get inside your head, you'll see me before it ends\n\nI am your worst nightmare\n\nDon't worry, don't be scared, I'm not going anywhere\n\n\n\nThis is a warning, yeah\n\nStill got blood on my hands!\n\nDon't fuck with me or else\n\nI'll see you in fucking hell, yeah!"
