  "lyrics": "I've got a million dollar secret\r\nCan't tell you what it is\r\nI'm keepin' it to myself, I won't give it away\r\nI've got a million dollar secret\r\nHope I have the courage\n\nTo keep it in, won't give in and just give it away\n\n\n\nIf you really wanna know, baby\n\nCome a little closer, and I'll whisper in your ear\n\nIf you really need to know, baby\n\nCome a little closer, and I'll whisper in your ear\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll have forgotten\n\nWhat I was gonna say\n\nBut come a little closer\n\nLet me whisper in your ear anyway\n\nMmm, anyway, mmm\n\n\n\nYou can ask over and over\n\nBut I'm not ready to tell\n\n'Cause I have all your attention\n\nThis feeling is suspended in air\n\nAnd I can keep it as long as I may need it\n\nHave all your attention as long as it's a mystery\n\n\n\nI've got this million dollar secret\n\nI think it's best for now that I hold strong\n\nMaybe I'll share it at the end of this song"
