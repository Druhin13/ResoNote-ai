  "lyrics": "Your glance sings of lyrics ‘cite from memory\r\nIts sad our goodbyes sound nostalgic\r\nYour chords swung me from an ol’ holler tree\r\nI’m living like a vagabond that just can’t decide\r\nWhen to leave\n\nWith roots are in the rhythm to my mood it swings\n\nI found even is impossible to keep\n\nEveryday starting up a balance beam\n\nStill you’re steady with me always carrying the melody\n\nSmiling all the while the paint chips off my mala prayer beads\n\n\n\nIt’s the images, contained – not the lens or frames\n\nRecalled to my mind before I fall asleep\n\nA list of regrets is no place to be\n\nI’m coming in late but I’ll never modulate us\n\nTo the minor key\n\nSmiling all the while the paint chips off my mardi gras beads"
