  "lyrics": "Every night\r\nI take myself to where the sky's are blue\r\nTo where we swim when I met you\r\nStay here\r\nI spent the best days of my life with you\n\nWatching clouds fall in the distance\n\nI watch the sunset on the beach with you\n\nIt's not over yet\n\n\n\nI want your love\n\nAnd I want it bad\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI want your love\n\nAnd I want it bad\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\n\n\nLet's begin again\n\nLet's get back to where we started\n\nWhen there was talk of getting older\n\nI've been waiting by the water\n\nLet's start over\n\n\n\nI want your love\n\nAnd I want it bad\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI want your love\n\nAnd I want it bad\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\n\n\nI know that the words don't change and\n\nI know that your heart keeps aching\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nEven when the light can't find me\n\nI know that the sun keeps shining\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nOh, I just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\n\n\nI want your love\n\nAnd I want it bad\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI want your love\n\nAnd I want it bad\n\nI just wanna treat you better\n\nI just wanna treat you better"
