  "lyrics": "His little feet can't reach the pedal so Daddy works the gas and brakes\r\nNine years old, \"10 and 2,\" tryin' everything to keep it straight\r\nDreamin' he's Dale Earnhardt, outside of some little town\r\nSomewhere in a truck right now\r\nWorked all summer for those mud tires, some tint, and a three inch lift\r\nTryin' to catch a buzz from a couple Buds they stole from Daddy's fridge\n\nBed full of buddies, a cab full of smoke and a cooler loaded down\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\n\n\nThere's freedom in the headlights, and Hank comin' out the dash\n\nLeft arm out the window, and straight pipes out the back\n\nThere's a good ole boy like me out there, just proud to be drivin' around\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\n\n\n17, got his daddy's keys, he knows the trouble he's in\n\n'Cause that piece of Heaven ridin' shotgun's supposed to be home by 10:00\n\nBut it's way past midnight, parked on the edge of town\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\n\n\nThere's freedom in the headlights, and Hank comin' out the dash\n\nLeft arm out the window, and straight pipes out the back\n\nThere's a good ole boy like me out there, just proud to be drivin' around\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\n\n\nWhen I close my eyes, I go there in my mind\n\nAnd I'm rollin' through those Alabama pines\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\n\n\nThere's freedom in the headlights, and Hank comin' out the dash\n\nLeft arm out the window, with straight pipes out the back\n\nThere's a good ole boy like me out there, just proud to be drivin' around\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\n\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now\n\nSomewhere in a truck right now"
