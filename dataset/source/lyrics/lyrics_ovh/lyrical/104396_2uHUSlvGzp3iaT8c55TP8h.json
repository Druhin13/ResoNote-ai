  "lyrics": "I can't help it, friends keep melting\r\nNo one is happy, we're all selfish\r\nMy fists get real tight, real life don't feel right\r\nDo what we want to, forget what we feel like\r\nSmoke 'til I'm too high, cry 'til I break down\r\nYou don't need no blue eyes, red eyes feel safe now\n\nMolly make it crazy, tequila makes it worse\n\nI know that you might hate me, do I have to write a verse?\n\n\n\nNo way, go away\n\nI think I've finally had enough\n\nNot today, walk away\n\nLife's already bad enough\n\nShut up, that's enough\n\nI just wanna be alone\n\nI think I'd rather be alone\n\n\n\nNo way, go away\n\nI think I've finally had enough\n\nNot today, walk away\n\nLife's already bad enough\n\nShut up, that's enough\n\nI just wanna be alone\n\nI think I'd rather be alone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morning sun sucks 'cause I wanna stay tucked\n\nI wanna get drunk without falling in love\n\nRemember last summer we didn't do much?\n\nI like it that way, that's a whole lot of fun\n\nSunday mornings are the best 'cause we are just beat to death\n\nYou can kill me in the club 'cause I don't dance like all the rest\n\nI'm not rude, I'm just decisive, I'm not cool [?] indecisive\n\nIf you are lonely then I like it, like it\n\n\n\nNo way, go away\n\nI think I've finally had enough\n\nNot today, walk away\n\nLife's already bad enough\n\nShut up, that's enough\n\nI just wanna be alone\n\nI think I'd rather be alone\n\n\n\nNo way, go away\n\nI think I've finally had enough\n\nNot today, walk away\n\nLife's already bad enough\n\nShut up, that's enough\n\nI just wanna be alone\n\nI think I'd rather be alone"
