  "lyrics": "In between a rock and a hard place\r\nTryin' to find your way through the dark days\r\nBut you don't know how\r\nYou flip the world upside down\r\nAnd right now, you don't wanna show it\r\n'Cause you don't think that anyone will notice\n\nUntil you tell someone\n\nYou'll feel like you're the only one\n\n\n\nAnd everybody says they're fine\n\nBut I know we're not alright\n\nEverybody says they're fine\n\nBut I know we're not alright\n\n\n\nI know we're not alright\n\nIt's always dark as just before the light\n\nI know your silence is a deadly sound\n\nIt's never easy when you're breaking down\n\nBut I'll be there when you come around\n\n\n\n(When you come around)\n\n\n\nFace down in the days that we wasted\n\nTryin' to find our way through the mazes\n\nWe can wait this out\n\nOr walk through that fire somehow\n\nYou tryna put together all the pieces\n\nWhen you should turn around now and leave 'em\n\n'Cause you can lose your mind\n\nTrying to live back in time\n\n\n\nAnd everybody says they're fine\n\nBut I know we're not alright\n\nEverybody says they're fine\n\nBut I know we're not alright\n\n\n\nI know we're not alright\n\nIt's always dark as just before the light\n\nI know your silence is a deadly sound\n\nIt's never easy when you're breaking down\n\nBut I'll be there when you come around\n\nWhen you come around, yeah\n\n\n\n\n\nI know we're not alright\n\nIt's always dark as just before the light\n\nI know your silence is a deadly sound\n\nIt's never easy when you're breaking down\n\nBut I'll be there when you come around\n\n\n\nWhen you come around\n\nWhen you come around"
