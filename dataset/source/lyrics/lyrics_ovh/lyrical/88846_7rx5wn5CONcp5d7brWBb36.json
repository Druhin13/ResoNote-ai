  "lyrics": "Quite some time, I been sittin' it out Didn't take no chances I was a pris'ner of doubt. I knocked down the wailin' wall Ain't no sin Got the feel of fortune; deal me in Comin' straight on for you. You made my mind. Now I'm stronger. Now I'm comin' through Straight on, straight on for you Straight on for you. Now I know I got to play my hand What the winner don't know, a gambler understands My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend I'll take my chances on you again and again Comin' straight on for you. You made my mind Now I'm stronger. Now I'm comin' through Straight on, straight on for you Straight on for you"
