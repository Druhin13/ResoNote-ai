  "lyrics": "The places that I go to\r\nHaven't been any good for my health\r\nI've been a stranger to myself\r\nMore than anyone else\r\nAnything I put you through\r\nYou should know I put myself through it first\n\nSo of course I know it hurts\n\nThat's what make it worth\n\n\n\nAnd still you treat me like a stranger\n\nKeep on looking down at me as if you're up on a shelf\n\nYou treat me like a stranger\n\nBut I guess that ain't no different than I treat myself\n\n\n\nWe forgot to move it on\n\nWe really shouldn't take too long\n\nIf you feel the way I think you do\n\nJust give me the sign babe and I'll be gone\n\nIt ain't worth all this pain\n\nAnd all this shit we're putting each other through\n\nYou and I have different points of view\n\nAnd somewhere in between them both lies the truth\n\n\n\nStill you treat me like a stranger\n\nKeep on looking down at me as if you're up on a shelf\n\nYou treat me like a stranger\n\nBut I guess that ain't no different than I treat myself\n\n\n\nAnd no matter what you say\n\nNo one knows you, no one knows me\n\nNo one knows us like they think they do\n\nAnd there ain't no way that anyone could\n\nAnd there ain't no reason anyone should\n\nYou know you really got to dig down deeper\n\nDeeper than you've ever dug down before in your life\n\nSometimes the hardest thing to do is what you don't want to\n\nBut you do it anyway because you know it's right\n\n\n\nAnd still you treat me like a stranger\n\nKeep on looking down at me as if you're up on a shelf\n\nYou treat me like a stranger\n\nBut I guess that ain't no different than I treat myself\n\nYou know you really got to dig down deeper\n\nDeeper than you've ever dug down before in your life\n\nSometimes the hardest thing to do is what you don't want to\n\nBut you do it anyway because you know it's right\n\nAnd still you treat me like a stranger"
