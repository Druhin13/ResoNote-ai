Which girls gonna be there? What time you coming home?\"\n\nMan, I don't know\n\n\n\nShe's off, I know\n\nBut I like her wrong\n\nI lost control, a long time ago\n\n\n\nAnd every time we play in the sheets\n\nI wake up with her marks all on me\n\nCall me crazy (crazy)\n\nBut I love her crazy (crazy)\n\nThe only kind of girl that's for me\n\nShe likes to mark her territory\n\nCall me crazy\n\nBut I love her crazy, yeah\n\n\n\nUh, look\n\nNow this was back before I even knew a thing\n\nBesides, you were the type I seen up on the movie screen\n\nAnd even though it's hard to tell her that you got plans\n\nShe got a body that'll make a preacher say, \"Goddamn\"\n\nHaha, yeah\n\nBut through it all, I still love her the same\n\n'Cause you appreciate the sun when it comes after the rain\n\nTake the puddles and just wash away\n\nNah, I ain't making this up, girl, you crazy as fuck\n\nBut damn, I think I'm in love, ha\n\n\n\nAnd every time we play in the sheets (in the sheets)\n\nI wake up with her marks all on me\n\nCall me crazy\n\nBut I love her crazy (She kinda crazy, I think I love her)\n\nThe only kind of girl that's for me (Girl that's for me)\n\nShe likes to mark her territory\n\nCall me crazy\n\nBut I love her crazy, yeah\n\n\n\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la (No other girl for me)\n\nLa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la\n\nYou crazy as fuck\n\nAnd I think I'm in love, haha"
