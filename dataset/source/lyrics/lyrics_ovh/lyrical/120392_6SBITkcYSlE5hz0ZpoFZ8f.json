  "lyrics": "Back in the States now\r\nIn a college town\r\nI would walk around\r\nBut it’s really coming down\r\nMesmerized by double lines\r\nTwo yellow tightropes\n\nI’m making good time\n\n\n\nI am never anywhere\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nWhen I’m home I’m never there\n\nLong enough to know\n\n\n\nBeing in love is the same thing as being alone\n\nGiving the sorrows and company\n\nNothing to say, stay on the phone\n\nI’m sorry I do not know what else you want from me\n\n\n\nI am never anywhere\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nWhen I’m home I’m never there\n\nLong enough to know\n\n\n\nYou say “How are you”, I say “I don’t know\n\nLet’s dissolve the band, move to Idaho\n\nEveryone’s around and I hear you smiling\n\nYou say “I love you”, I say “You too”\n\n\n\nI am never anywhere\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nWhen I’m home I’m never there\n\nLong enough to know\n\nOoh-oh-oh-oh\n\nOoh-oh-oh-oh\n\n\n\nI am never anywhere\n\nAnywhere I go\n\nWhen I’m home I’m never there\n\nLong enough"
