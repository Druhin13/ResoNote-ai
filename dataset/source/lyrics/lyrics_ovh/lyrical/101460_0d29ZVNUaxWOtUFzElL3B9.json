  "lyrics": "Don't you have anything better to do?\r\nI wish that someone could hug you\r\nMust be lonely\r\nBeing angry\r\nFeeling over-looked\r\nYou sit alone at home in the darkness\n\nWith all the pent-up rage that you harness\n\nI'm real sorry\n\n'Bout whatever happened to you\n\n\n\nI wanna walk through the park in the dark\n\nMen are scared that women will laugh at them\n\nI wanna walk through the park in the dark\n\nWomen are scared that men will kill them\n\n\n\nI hold my keys\n\nBetween my fingers\n\n\n\nHe said \"I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup\n\nAnd spit out better words than you\"\n\nBut you didn't\n\nMan, you're kidding yourself if you think\n\nThe world revolves around you\n\nYou know you got lots to give\n\nAnd so many options\n\nI'm real sorry\n\n'Bout whatever happened to you\n\n\n\nI wanna walk through the park in the dark\n\nMen are scared that women will laugh at them\n\nI wanna walk through the park in the dark\n\nWomen are scared that men will kill them\n\n\n\nI hold my keys\n\nBetween my fingers\n\n\n\nI wanna walk through the park in the dark\n\nMen are scared that women will laugh at them\n\nI wanna walk through the park in the dark\n\nWomen are scared that men will kill them\n\n\n\nI hold my keys\n\nBetween my fingers\n\nGo on, tell me\n\nYou're just kidding\n\nHe said, she said\n\nNameless, faceless"
