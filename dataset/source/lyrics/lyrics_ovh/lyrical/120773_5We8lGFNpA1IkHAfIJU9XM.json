What you gon' do?\nBack and I'm black and I'm acting brand new\nNiggas in the back like, \"Oh word\"\nDiamonds all black like, \"Fuck what ya heard\"\nFuck what ya heard, fuck what ya heard\nSpillin' some Hennessy Black on the curb\nThis for the memory of the deceased\nWhen I black out, I awaken the beast\nWhat it's gon' be? What it's gon' be?\nYou don't wanna fuck with a nigga like me\nBet you never seen a mothafucka so black\nNigga, I'm black on black on black on black\n\n\n[Buddy]\nBlack, black, black\nBlack on black\nBlack my thoughts so black\nBlack, black on black\nMy skin is so black, I'm rocking that black on black\nIt's black\nBlack rims on these black wheels\nIn this black whip with this black bitch\nI'm so black on black on black on black on black\nBlack, black, black\nBlack on black\nBlack my thoughts so black\nBlack, black on black\nMy skin is so black, I'm rocking all black\nEverything is black\nBlack rims on these black wheels\n\nIn this black whip with this black bitch\nI'm so black on black on black on black on black\n\n[A$AP Ferg]\nThis kid black Timbs black\nKill tracks like I'm six black (Black ass nigga!)\nHair blacker than black lips black\nEven my dick black\nGrandad Irish Trinidad\nGuess I am half (Black ass nigga!)\nI gotta go to Ancestry.com\nI think I'm 'bout to black\nAll the police ain't about the black\nHe still a pig even though he black\nWillie got a lynch, head in that\nIf you black you dead in that\nStrange fruit hang from a tree\nOn the leaves is red and that\n\nDo it right like a Garveyite\nAfrica, I'm heading back\nNiggas in the street black on black\nKill him with the heat (Blat, blat, blat)\nCut off his feet (put em in the shackle)\nMansa Musa been had the cash\nMix blacks to dilute blacks\nDon't want blacks to produce blacks\nTake black and they boot that\nOrange is the new black\n\n[Buddy]\nBlack, black, black\nBlack on black\nBlack my thoughts so black\nBlack, black on black\nMy skin is so black, I'm rocking that black on black\n\nIt's black\nBlack rims on these black wheels\nIn this black whip with this black bitch\nI'm so black on black on black on black on black\nBlack, black, black\nBlack on black\nBlack my thoughts so black\nBlack, black on black\nMy skin is so black, I'm rocking all black\nEverything is black\nBlack rims on these black wheels\nIn this black whip with this black bitch\nI'm so black on black on black on black on black\n\n[Buddy]\nI feel like Trayvon with this black hoodie on\nHuey P. Newton\nBlack Revolution\n\nI'm with a Nubian Queen and some illegal aliens\nI got a black fist balled up and it ain't just me, it's all us\nFour hundred years of oppression\nI'm about to get me that black Tesla\nBlack Skid marks on the pavement\nCops wanna see me in a black cage\nBlack on black on black\nMaster Juba with the tap dance\nGucci with the Dapper Dan\nTell 'em, \"Kiss my black ass\"\nRidin' on the dyno with black mags\nJust another black man tryin' stay up out the casket\nBlack don't crack\nMatter fact, where the fuck our forty acres at?\n\n[Buddy]\n\nBlack, black, black\nBlack on black\nBlack my thoughts so black\nBlack, black on black\nMy skin is so black, I'm rocking that black on black\nIt's black\nBlack rims on these black wheels\nIn this black whip with this black bitch\nI'm so black on black on black on black on black\nBlack, black, black\nBlack on black\nBlack my thoughts so black\nBlack, black on black\nMy skin is so black, I'm rocking all black\nEverything is black\nBlack rims on these black wheels\nIn this black whip with this black bitch\nI'm so black on black on black on black on black\n\n[ Buddy]\nBlack, black, black, black, black..."
