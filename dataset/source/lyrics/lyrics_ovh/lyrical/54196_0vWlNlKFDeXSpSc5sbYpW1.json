  "lyrics": "The club isn't the best place to find a lover\r\nSo the bar is where I go\r\nMe and my friends at the table doing shots\r\nDrinking fast and then we talk slow\r\nCome over and start up a conversation with just me\r\nAnd trust me I'll give it a chance now\n\nTake my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox\n\nAnd then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like\n\n\n\nGirl, you know I want your love\n\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\n\nCome on now, follow my lead\n\nCome on now, follow my lead\n\n\n\nI'm in love with the shape of you\n\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\n\nAlthough my heart is falling too\n\nI'm in love with your body\n\nLast night you were in my room\n\nAnd now my bedsheets smell like you\n\nEvery day discovering something brand new\n\n\n\nI'm in love with your body\n\nOhIohIohIohI\n\nI'm in love with your body\n\nOhIohIohIohI\n\nI'm in love with the shape of you\n\n\n\nOne week in we let the story begin\n\nWe're going out on our first date\n\nYou and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat\n\nFill up your bag and I fill up a plate\n\nWe talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour\n\nAnd how your family is doing okay\n\nLeave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat\n\nTell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like\n\n\n\nBoy, you know I want your love\n\nYour love was handmade for somebody like me\n\nCome on now, follow my lead\n\nCome on now, follow my lead\n\n\n\nI'm in love with the shape of you\n\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\n\nAlthough my heart is falling too\n\nI'm in love with your body\n\nLast night you were in my room\n\nAnd now my bedsheets smell like you\n\nEvery day discovering something brand new\n\n\n\nI'm in love with your body\n\nOhIohIohIohI(I'm in love with the shape of you)\n\nI'm in love with your body\n\nOhIohIohIohI(I'm in love with the shape of you)\n\nI'm in love with the shape of you\n\n\n\nCome on, be my baby, come on\n\nCome on, be my baby, come on\n\nCome on, be my baby, come on\n\nCome on, be my baby\n\n\n\nI'm in love with the shape of you\n\nWe push and pull like a magnet do\n\nLast night you were in my room\n\nEvery day discovering something brand new\n\nI'm in love with the shape of you"
