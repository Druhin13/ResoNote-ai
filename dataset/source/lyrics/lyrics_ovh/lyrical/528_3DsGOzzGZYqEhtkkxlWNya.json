  "lyrics": "The streets, the signs are pointing all one way\r\nBut you don't realize just what they say\r\nYou may fight, you may run, you may know what you've done\r\nIt makes me feel so sad to think what I might've had\r\nI watch the stars, I watch the sun, now I watch for anyone\r\nBut it's only make believe\n\n\n\nYou work, you work, you work so hard and then\n\nSomeone, someone will come around again\n\nYou may think it's for real, but you know how you feel\n\nThe places that I go don't feel good anymore\n\nI see it all rainbows in fall I see her face upon my wall\n\nBut it's only make believe\n\n\n\nFly away, bluebird fly away for me\n\nTo a place somewhere far across the sea\n\nFly away, far away, don't look back, go today\n\nThe waves that crash upon the sand\n\nAnother place, a far off land\n\nAnd every day, I have to stay, but you are free\n\nYou could fly away-\n\nBut it's only make believe"
