  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson &Run par Sir Sly\r\nYou could be another face that I forget soon as I move along\nEverybody makes mistakes; am I mistaken for the way I carry on?\nYou could show a little grace, but maybe things just went a bit too far\nWe are just who we are; no time for \"what if\"s and \"what if not\"s\n\nHeavy as the setting sun\nOh, I'm counting all the numbers between zero and one\nHappy, but a little lost\nWell, I don't know what I don't know\nSo I'll kick my shoes off and run (yeah)\nKick my shoes off and run\n\nKick my shoes off and run (run, we'll be running barefoot)\nKick my shoes off and run\nKick my shoes off and\n\nYou could be a happy bride and we could still be blissfully in love\nInstead of being 25 and already feeling like you have had enough\nYou could be my one regret, infinitely spiraling me down\nSometimes the world feels loud\n\nHeavy as the setting sun\nOh, I'm counting all the numbers between zero and one\nHappy, but a little lost\nWell, I don't know what I don't know\n\nSo I'll kick my shoes off and run (yeah)\nKick my shoes off and run\nKick my shoes off and run (run, we'll be running barefoot)\nKick my shoes off and run\nKick my shoes off and\n\nRun\nRun, run, run\nRun\nRun, run, run\n\nHeavy as the setting sun\nOh, I'm counting all the numbers between zero and one (run, run, run)\nHappy, but a little lost\nWell, I don't know what I don't know\nSo I'll kick my shoes off and\n\nRun into the setting sun\n\nRun, run, run\nRun into the setting sun\nRun, run, run\nI'll run into the setting sun\nRun, run, run\nI'll run into the setting sun"
