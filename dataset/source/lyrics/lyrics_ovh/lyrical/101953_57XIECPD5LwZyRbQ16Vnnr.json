  "lyrics": "Rocking around the Christmas tree\r\nAt the Christmas party hop\r\nMistletoe hung where you can see\r\nEvery couple tries to stop\r\nRocking around the Christmas tree\r\nLet the Christmas spirit ring\n\nLater we'll have some pumpkin pie\n\nAnd we'll do some caroling\n\n\n\nYou will get a sentimental\n\nFeeling when you hear\n\nVoices singing let's be jolly\n\nDeck the halls with boughs of holly\n\nRocking around the Christmas tree\n\nHave a happy holiday\n\nEveryone dancing merrily\n\nIn the new old-fashioned way\n\n\n\nYou will get a sentimental\n\nFeeling when you hear\n\nVoices singing let's be jolly\n\nDeck the halls with boughs of holly\n\nRocking around the Christmas tree\n\nHave a happy holiday\n\nEveryone dancing merrily\n\nIn the new old-fashioned way"
