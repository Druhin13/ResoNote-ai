  "lyrics": "(feat. Sophie Ellis-Bextor)\r\nI know your feeling restless\r\nLike life's not on your side\r\nIt's weighing heavy on your mind\n\nBut when we stand united\n\nOur hearts they beat in time\n\nAnd I know we'll make it all alright\n\n\n\nLet's bring it back to you and me\n\nThere's no one else around\n\nNow don't get lost in gravity\n\n\n\n'Cause I want you to hold me now\n\nNothing else matters\n\nIt's just the two of us\n\nAnd if it all falls down\n\nNothing else matters\n\nYou know we're strong enough\n\n\n\nI'm not giving up\n\nI'm not giving up on us\n\nI said im not giving up\n\nI'm not giving up on love\n\n\n\nWe're of the same existence\n\nNo lock without a key\n\nWe can't deny it's meant to be\n\n\n\nCause I feel it inside\n\nTaking over tonight\n\nI'll be there when the storm is breaking\n\n\n\nIn this moment I'm yours\n\nYou can always be sure\n\nThat together we're gonna make it\n\n\n\nSo baby won't you hold me now\n\nNothing else matters\n\nIt's just the two of us\n\nAnd if it all falls down\n\nNothing else matters\n\nYou know we're strong enough\n\n\n\nI'm not giving up\n\nI'm not giving up on us\n\nI said im not giving up\n\nI'm not giving up on love"
