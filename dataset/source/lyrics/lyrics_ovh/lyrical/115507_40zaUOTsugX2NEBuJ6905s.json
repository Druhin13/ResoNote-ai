  "lyrics": "Keeping up old ways\r\nExpecting different things\r\nYou can't say the words\r\nYou can't say the words\r\nOff, off and on\n\nTalking face to face\n\nFeel but feelings change\n\nI can't say the words\n\nI can't say the words\n\nOff, off and on\n\n\n\nHustled out of there\n\nFell right down the stairs\n\nI won't say the words\n\nI won't say the words\n\nOff, off and on\n\n\n\nCircle around a hometown\n\nYou once knew that you'd never regret\n\nThat you left\n\nIs it just our indifference, or the distance\n\nThat keeps us on this path?\n\nOutta sight, outta mind\n\nYou'll ignore all the signs\n\nHow do you like me now?"
