  "lyrics": "I feel you, it's like you're in the next room\r\nAt any given moment, you could reappear\r\nThin air, you're out there in it somewhere\r\nIf I could only get there, I could breathe again\r\nTell me how to start\n\nWhat comes after you\n\nI am in the dark\n\nLove, what now?\n\n\n\nNo such thing as over you\n\nI don't want it anyway\n\nI wouldn't even try to\n\nIf I don't let go then there is\n\nNo such thing as over this\n\nI've tried to get over you, over you, over you\n\nBut I think, there's no such thing\n\n\n\nBroken, you're Rome, I am the ruins\n\nThe stone I can't find you in\n\nIs all that still remains\n\n\n\nLittle white lights, they perforate\n\nEvery night sky, I say it to them\n\nEvery time, come back in\n\n\n\nNo such thing as over you\n\nI don't want it anyway\n\nI wouldn't even try to\n\nIf I don't let go then there is\n\nNo such thing as over this\n\nI've tried to get over you, over you, over you\n\n\n\nYou're on my mind, all the time\n\nBut I can't fix it by fixating on a rewind\n\nWhen a good thing changes\n\nWhen the change is staying\n\nOnly thing to find is\n\nWhat to hold on till there's something else to, hold on to\n\nHold on, till there's something else to, hold on to\n\n\n\nNo such thing\n\nI don't want it anyway\n\nI wouldn't even try to\n\nIf I don't let go then there is\n\nNo such thing as over this\n\nI've tried to get over you, over you, over you\n\nBut I think, there's no such thing"
