Nobody knows\n\nI'm looking for someone, but she isn't here\n\nYeah, she's an angel, she's nowhere near\n\nStepped below the surface, tryna find my way out\n\nBut even if I make it through, there's no one around\n\nI thought that I saw you, you never let go\n\nThis world got the best of us, what do you know\n\n\n\nEvery time I look for you\n\nYou're nowhere near, it makes me blue\n\nI swear I need you by my side right now\n\nForever, baby\n\nEvery time I look for you\n\nYou're nowhere near, it makes me blue\n\nI swear I need you by my side right now\n\nForever"
