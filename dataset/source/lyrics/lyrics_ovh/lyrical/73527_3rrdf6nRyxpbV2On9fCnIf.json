  "title": "Wonderful Tonight",
  "lyrics": "It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.\r\nShe puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.\r\nAnd then she asks me, \"Do I look all right?\"\r\nAnd I say, \"Yes, you look wonderful tonight.\"\r\nWe go to a party and everyone turns to see\n\nThis beautiful lady that's walking around with me.\n\nAnd then she asks me, \"Do you feel all right?\"\n\nAnd I say, \"Yes, I feel wonderful tonight.\"\n\n\n\nI feel wonderful because I see\n\nThe love light in your eyes.\n\nAnd the wonder of it all\n\nIs that you just don't realize how much I love you.\n\n\n\nIt's time to go home now and I've got an aching head,\n\nSo I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.\n\nAnd then I tell her, as I turn out the light,\n\nI say, \"My darling, you were wonderful tonight.\n\nOh my darling, you were wonderful tonight.\""
