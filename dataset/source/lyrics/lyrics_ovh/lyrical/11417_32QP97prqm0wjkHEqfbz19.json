  "lyrics": "How do you break through\r\nWhen the words don't meet your lips\r\nAnd lump inside your throat\r\nOr in a pile of could've beens\r\nAll the small talk and the catch up and the empty promises\r\nHow do you dive deeper\n\nIn a shallow riverbed\n\nWhen the current pulls you further\n\nFrom what you should've said\n\n\n\nGetting by on the kindness of strangers\n\nGetting by on the kindness of strangers\n\n\n\nWhen you're trying to be tender\n\nBut instead you come off cold\n\nWhen your sweetness surrenders\n\nTo the cruelness of this world\n\nAll the small stuff and the bad luck\n\nWhen it all becomes too much\n\nHow do you find solace\n\nIn a place so quick to judge\n\nDo you try and play it cool\n\nPlay the part you think they want\n\n\n\nGetting by on the kindness of strangers\n\nGetting by on the kindness of strangers\n\n(Kindness of strangers)\n\n(Kindness of strangers)\n\n\n\nPeople come and people go\n\nAnd some will make their mark\n\nLike an iron to the bowl\n\nA cymbal in your heart\n\nAnd the ones that stick around\n\nAre the hardest ones to find\n\nAnd if you can't find the closest\n\nYou need the kindness to survive\n\n\n\nGetting by on the kindness of strangers\n\nGetting by on the kindness of strangers\n\nGetting by (kindness of strangers)\n\nGetting by (kindness of strangers)\n\n(Kindness of strangers)\n\n(Kindness of strangers)"
