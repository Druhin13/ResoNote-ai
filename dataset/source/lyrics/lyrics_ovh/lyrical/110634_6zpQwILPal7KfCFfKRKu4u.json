I got it, I'm gettin' it there\n\nThat way that I’m livin', they say it ain't fair\n\nTwenty two bitches, yeah, Bern is a player\n\nTwenty two joints, hit it, smoke in the air\n\nDiamonds so clean when I roll up they stare\n\nPussy so good I might go in it bare\n\nFuck it, I'm livin', I really don't care\n\nIt's Bern\n\n\n\nShyeah\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\n\n\nI'm twenty nine with a three year old, take care of mine\n\nSome run from their destiny, I'm not scared of mine\n\nWanna take a walk in these Chucks? Well, here's a pair of mine\n\nRather do things on my own then just stand and whine\n\nI never learned to wait for shit or stand in line\n\nIf you really ridin' for Taylor Gang, you a fan of mine\n\nWhen that bag ain't all the way filled up, I can't arrive\n\nWhen everything ain't goin' right, the stars ain't aligned\n\nWhen I was in the Burg, my main goal was stayin' alive\n\nIf you can't take of yours, you gon' pay the price\n\nIf your girl comin' with me then I'm gon' lay the pipe\n\nSometimes when I smoke other weed, my brain ain't right\n\nMe and Bern smoke day and night\n\n\n\nYeah, it's Taylor Gang over everything\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\nThat means over you and that stupid shit you talkin' 'bout, Gang\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\nPut somethin' real in the joint and smoke that, uhh\n\nThat money got me feelin' like\n\nThat money got me feelin' like"
