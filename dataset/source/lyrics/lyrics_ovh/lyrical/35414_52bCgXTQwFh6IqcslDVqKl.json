Would you break me now?\n\nYou won't break us, you won't break us now\n\n\n\nSole state of mind, the state of mine\n\nAlways, I won't let you down\n\nIt's all in our days to find a way\n\nAnd say I'll have you 'round\n\n\n\nI've been there before, I've seen it once more\n\nWould I see you are going, see you are\n\nWould you break me? Would you break me now?\n\nYou won't break us, you won't break us now\n\n\n\nWould you break me? Would you break me now?\n\nYou won't break us, you won't break us now\n\n\n\nPlease break all to the underground\n\nPlease break all to the underground\n\nPlease break all to the underground\n\nPlease break all to the underground"
