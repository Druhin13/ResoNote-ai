  "lyrics": "The weight of my mistakes\r\nMy regrets and all my shame\r\nLike gravity, it's pulling me\r\nThe waves keep crashing in\r\nThings I've done and who I've been\r\nThe gravity, it's pulling me\n\n\n\nI am falling, will You catch me?\n\nGod, I need You to be my rescue\n\nI am broken, will You fix me?\n\nGod, I need You to be my rescue\n\nBe my parachute\n\n\n\nThe fear that I'm alone\n\nAround my neck like a stone\n\nAnd gravity, it's pulling me\n\nI've heard that You are good and You are strong\n\nAnd if I could I would believe\n\nHelp me to believe\n\n\n\n'Cause I am falling, will You catch me?\n\nGod, I need You to be my rescue\n\nI am broken, will You fix me?\n\nGod, I need You to be my rescue\n\nBe my parachute\n\n\n\nI know I need You to save me\n\n'Cause no one beside You\n\nCould save me now\n\nCould save me now\n\n\n\n'Cause I am falling, will You catch me?\n\nGod, I need You to be my rescue\n\nI am broken, will You fix me?\n\nGod, I need You to be my rescue...\n\n\n\nBe my parachute, parachute\n\nBe my parachute, parachute\n\nBe my parachute"
