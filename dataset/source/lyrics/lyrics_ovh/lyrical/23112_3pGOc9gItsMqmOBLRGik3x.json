My name's Al and I'm a Capricorn\n\n\n\nIt's just a thing we do\n\nWe goin' down the middle, 'round the outside\n\nJust us, no need to rush\n\nWe got the savoir faire and plenty besides\n\nIf you wanna get with us\n\nThen won't you let me know\n\nIt's just a thing we do\n\nWe are a generation on the right side\n\n\n\nOoohhhhh"
