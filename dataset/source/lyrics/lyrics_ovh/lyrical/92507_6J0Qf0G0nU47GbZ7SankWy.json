I was the plug for\n\nHe ain't wanna shoot then why the fuck he got a gun for?\nLet her give me top until I bust, ain't wanna fuck more\nIf she didn't wanna fuck I kick her out and bring her friends through\nNina got the lead and finna make yo face a stencil\nYour bitch in the passenger she wonder what my Benz do\nHunnid on the dash, I'm on the freeway, sippin' Hen, too\n\nLike what up, slime?
