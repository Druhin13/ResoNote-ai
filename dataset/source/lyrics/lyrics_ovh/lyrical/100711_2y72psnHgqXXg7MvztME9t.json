  "lyrics": "I've had choices since the day that I was born\r\nThere were voices that told me right from wrong\r\nIf I had listened, no I wouldn't be here today\r\nLiving and dying with the choices I've made\r\nI was tempted, by an early age I'd found\n\nI like drinkin', oh, and I never turned it down\n\nThere were loved ones but I turned them all away\n\nLiving and dying with the choices I've made\n\n\n\nI've had choices since the day that I was born\n\nThere were voices that told me right from wrong\n\nIf I had listened, no I wouldn't be here today\n\nLiving and dying with the choices I've made\n\n\n\nI guess I'm payin' for the things that I have done\n\nIf I could go back, oh, Lord knows I'd run\n\nI'm still losin' this game of life I play\n\nLiving and dying with the choices I've made\n\n\n\nI've had choices since the day that I was born\n\nThere were voices that told me right from wrong\n\nIf I had listened, no I wouldn't be here today\n\nLiving and dying with the choices I've made\n\n\n\nLiving and dying with the choices I've made"
