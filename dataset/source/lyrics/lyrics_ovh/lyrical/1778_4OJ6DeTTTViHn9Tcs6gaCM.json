  "lyrics": "Carried your burdens in my heart\r\nSidelined your shallow ways\r\nIt just tore me apart\r\nI used to think I was your savior\r\nI see through you now\r\nYou indulge in this behavior\n\n\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nI don't think we should talk anymore\n\nI want the best for you\n\nBut you're happy being miserable\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nOr someone who's so focused on themselves\n\nI'll save my best for someone else\n\n\n\nWe can debate our separate views\n\nJust look at all your roadblocks\n\nLogic will show you truth\n\nI've hid in shadows, wrestled demons\n\nBut I won't deny it because I know how to defeat them\n\n\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nI don't think we should talk anymore\n\nI want the best for you\n\nBut you're happy being miserable\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nOr someone who's so focused on themselves\n\nI'll save my best for someone else\n\n\n\nWhen you throw me under the bus\n\nBack it up and run me over\n\nIf I always catch your fall\n\nYou will never hit the surface to feel it all\n\nYou gotta feel it all\n\n\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nI don't think we should talk anymore\n\nI want the best for you\n\nBut you're happy being miserable\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nOr someone who's so focused on themselves\n\nI'll save my best for someone else\n\nI'll save my best for someone else\n\n(I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you)\n\nI'll save my best for someone else\n\n(I don't want to know you, I don't want to know you)\n\nI don't want to know you\n\nOr someone who's so focused on themselves\n\nI'll save my best for someone else"
