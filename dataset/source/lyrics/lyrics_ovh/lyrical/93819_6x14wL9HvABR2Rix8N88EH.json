  "lyrics": "It was quite early one morning\r\nHit me without warning\r\nI went to hear the general speak\r\nI was standing for the anthem\r\nBanners all around him\r\nConfetti made it hard to see\n\nPut my footsteps on the pavement\n\nStarved for entertainment\n\nFour seasons of revolving doors\n\nSo sick of being honest\n\nI'll die like Dylan Thomas\n\nA seizure on the barroom floor\n\n\n\nI'm getting greedy with this private hell\n\nI'll go it alone, but that's just as well\n\n\n\nThese cats are scared and feral\n\nThe flag pins on their lapels\n\nThe truth is anybody's guess\n\nThese talking heads are saying\n\nThe king is only playing a game of four dimensional chess\"\n\n\n\nThere's flowers in the rubble\n\nThe weeds are gonna tumble\n\nI'm lucid but I still can't think\n\nI'm strapped into a corset\n\nClimbed into your corvette\n\nI'm thirsty for another drink\n\n\n\nIf it's advertised, we'll try it\n\nAnd buy some peace and quiet\n\nAnd shut up at the silent retreat\n\nThey say you've gotta fake it\n\nAt least until you make it\n\nThat ghost is just a kid in a sheet\n\n\n\nI'm getting used to these dizzy spells\n\nI'm taking a shower at the Bates Motel\n\nI'm getting greedy with this private hell\n\nI'll go it alone, but that's just as well"
