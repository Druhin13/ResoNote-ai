  "lyrics": "When it's all said and done\r\nThey gon' wanna come\r\nWants to bet on this one\r\nThey gon' wanna come\r\nBut what use do I have for you then?\n\nYou would never dare when it was all happenin'\n\nYou weren't when with me shooting in the gym\n\nBut here you come runnin' after we get to win\n\n\n\nWhen it's all said and done\n\nThey gon' wanna come\n\nWants to bet on this one\n\nThey gon' wanna come\n\n\n\nYou were so predictable\n\nYou were so busy but now you want tickets to the show\n\nYou wanna be a part of the crowd\n\nBut the only reason is just the fear of missin' out\n\n\n\nWhen it's all said and done\n\nThey gon' wanna come\n\nWants to bet on this one\n\nThey gon' wanna come\n\n\n\nI said you don't need to worry about it\n\nThey won't get too far\n\nIt's why you said you better believe it\n\nWhen they show you who they are\n\nI'm not sayin' it's gonna be easy\n\nBut you gotta do what you know\n\nPeople all like to win, yeah\n\nThey go where ever it bloom\n\n\n\nWhen it's all said and done\n\nThey gon' wanna come\n\nWants to bet on this one\n\nThey gon' wanna come\n\n\n\nSo I got a honest question\n\nHow many of y'all\n\nWould ever go through your girl's phone?\n\nI probably would not\n\nI'm just, I just feel like if I'm supposed to know who's gonna come to me\n\nI'm not going to look for it\n\nLike, I'm straight, I don't wanna go through it"
