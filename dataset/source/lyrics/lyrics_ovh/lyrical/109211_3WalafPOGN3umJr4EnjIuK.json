  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Murder By Numbers par The Police\r\nOnce that you've decided on a killing,\nFirst you make a stone of your heart.\nAnd if you find that your hands are still willing,\nThen you can turn a murder into art.\n\nThere really isn't any need for bloodshed,\nYou just do it with a little more finesse.\nIf you can slip a tablet into someone's coffee,\nThen it avoids an awful lot of mess.\n\nIt's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3,\nIt's as easy to learn as your ABC.\nMurder by numbers, 1, 2, 3,\nIt's as easy to learn as your ABC.\n\n\nNow if you have a taste for this experience\nAnd you're flushed with your very first success,\nThen you must try a twosome or a threesome\nAnd you'll find your conscience bothers you much less\n\nBecause murder is like anything you take to\nIt's a habit-forming need for more and more.\nYou can bump off every member of your family\nAnd anybody else you find a bore\n\nBecause it's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3,\nIt's as easy to learn as your ABC\nMurder by numbers, 1, 2, 3,\nIt's as easy to learn as your ABC.\n\nNow you can join the ranks of the illustrious\nIn history's great dark hall of fame.\n\nAll our greatest killers were industrious\nAt least the ones that we all know by name.\n\nBut you can reach the top of your profession\nIf you become the leader of the land,\nFor murder is the sport of the elected,\nAnd you don't need to lift a finger of your hand\n\nBecause it's murder by numbers, 1, 2, 3,\nIt's as easy to learn as your ABC.\nMurder by numbers, 1, 2, 3,\nIt's as easy to learn as your A, B, C, D, E,.........."
