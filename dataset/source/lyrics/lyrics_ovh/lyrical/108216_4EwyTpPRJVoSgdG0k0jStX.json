  "lyrics": "Stare out the window, \nYou can't make the time go \nYou don't even know why you're here \nWait for the weekend to go off the deep end \nand make everything disappear \nYou're lost in a teenage jail \n\nSo you and so vicious and so frail \n\nwhere something is always for sale \n\nYou're lost in a teenage jail. \n\n\n\nYou're not like your mothers. \n\nyou're not like the others \n\nYou're not quite like anyone else, \n\n\n\nThey don't even know you, \n\nGot nothing to show you, \n\nSo get something good for yourself \n\nYou're lost in a teenage jail \n\nSo young and so vicious and so frail \n\nWhere something is always for sale. \n\nYou're lost in a teenage jail."
