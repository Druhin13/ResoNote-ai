  "lyrics": "Lips meet teeth and tongue\r\nMy heart skips eight beats at once\r\nIf we were meant to be, we would have been by now\r\nSee what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now\r\nI'll sit and watch your car burn\n\nWith the fire that you started in me\n\nBut you never came back to ask it out\n\nGo ahead and watch my heart burn\n\nWith the fire that you started in me\n\nBut I'll never let you back to put it out\n\n\n\nYour love feels so fake\n\nAnd my demands aren't high to make\n\nIf I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now\n\nYour lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out\n\n\n\nI'll sit and watch your car burn\n\nWith the fire that you started in me\n\nBut you never came back to ask it out\n\nGo ahead and watch my heart burn\n\nWith the fire that you started in me\n\nBut I'll never let you back to put it out\n\n\n\nWhen you call my name\n\nDo you think I'll come runnin'?\n\nYou never did the same\n\nSo good at givin' me nothin'\n\nWhen you close your eyes, do you picture me?\n\nWhen you fantasize, am I your fantasy?\n\nNow you know\n\nNow I'm free\n\n\n\nI'll sit and watch your car burn\n\nWith the fire that you started in me\n\nBut you never came back to ask it out\n\nWatch my heart burn\n\nWith the fire that you started in me\n\nBut I'll never let you back to put it out\n\n\n\nNever let you burn\n\nLet you burn, let you burn\n\nNever gonna let you burn\n\nLet you burn"
