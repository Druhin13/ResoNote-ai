A deal? A deal\n\nSorry on the real\n\nBut my eyes and my ears don't work well\n\nAnd the floor keeps sliding out my heels\n\nI can't feel 'em am I still dreaming?\n\nSkull on the table a still life\n\nIs this still life?\n\nWhat's the meaning are we still dealing?\n\nFeel like I can't act right\n\nOh right\n\n\n\nSugar city\n\nPretty magic\n\nGot me good vibes\n\nThank God I ain't driving\n\nTraffic vision\n\nBlurred blue bleedin'\n\nThat's a black out ladder\n\nIt don't matter anyhow\n\nI'm climbing\n\nKeep my good vibes\n\nAnd check coats for cool climates\n\nIn common we got\n\nGood friends rolled light on split ends\n\nPretty magic\n\nTraffic addicts\n\n\n\nI'll make a deal with you, if all you want\n\nIs not to leave love, to run em up\n\n\n\nCall me When It Lands\n\nHit me up when you're close\n\nCall me when you can\n\nCall me when you close\n\n\n\nWhen were you planning on coming my way?\n\nI've been here waiting all damn day to turn the the lights down low\n\nAnd turn the table on you\n\nWill you keep all that you came with and more?\n\nI'd play your game but I don't know what for\n\nCut the cable on\n\nEvery table I lose\n\n\n\nCall me When It Lands\n\nHit me up when you're close\n\nWhen you know you've won"
