  "lyrics": "It's hard to watch her eyes\r\nBehind her love disguise\r\nIf ever you should find\r\nA heartbreak in her smile\r\nOh it's getting later\n\nIt's almost time to go\n\nIf only you could tell her\n\nBefore she melts away like snow\n\n\n\nShe will be gone\n\nAnd soon the dawn\n\n\n\nIt's hard to say goodbye\n\nIt's cold out in the night\n\nShe wants to keep you right\n\nUnderneath her sight\n\n\n\nOh it's getting later\n\nIt's almost time to go\n\nYou only want to love her\n\nIt's your heart that tells you so"
