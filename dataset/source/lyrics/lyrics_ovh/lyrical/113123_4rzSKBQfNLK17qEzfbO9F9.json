  "lyrics": "Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again \nIt's just a game I just can't win \nThere you are breathin' soft on my skin \nStill you won't let me in \nWhy save your kisses for a rainy day \n\nBaby let the moment take your heart away \n\n\n\nHave you ever needed someone so bad, yeah \n\nHave you ever wanted someone \n\nYou just couldn't have \n\nDid you ever try so hard \n\nThat your world just fell apart \n\nHave you ever needed someone so bad \n\nAnd you're the girl I gotta have \n\nI gotta have you baby \n\n\n\nThere you go, midnight promises again \n\nBut they're broken by the dawn \n\nYou wanna go further, faster every day baby \n\nBut in the morning you'll be gone \n\nAnd I'm alone \n\n\n\n[Repeat Bridge]\n\n[Repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\nEvery dream I dream is like \n\nSome Kinda rash 'n' reckless scene \n\nTo give out such crazy love \n\nou must be some kinda drug \n\nAnd if my time don't ever come \n\nFor me you're still the same \n\nDamned if I don't, damned if I do \n\nI gotta get a fix on you \n\n\n\n[Repeat chorus]"
