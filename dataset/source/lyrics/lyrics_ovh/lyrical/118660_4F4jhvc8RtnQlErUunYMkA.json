  "lyrics": "On a rattlesnake speedway in the Utah desert\r\nI pick up my money and head back into town\r\nDriving cross the Waynesboro county line\r\nI got the radio on and I'm just killing time\r\nWorking all day in my daddy's garage\r\nDriving all night chasing some mirage\n\nPretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge\n\n(chorus)\n\nThe dogs on Main Street howl `cause they understand\n\nIf I could take one moment into my hands\n\nMister I ain't a boy no I'm a man\n\nAnd I believe in a promised land\n\n\n\nI've done my best to live the right way\n\nI get up every morning and go to work each day\n\nBut your eyes go blind and your blood runs cold\n\nSometimes I feel so weak I just want to explode\n\nExplode and tear this town apart\n\nTake a knife and cut this pain from my heart\n\nFind somebody itching for something to star\n\n\n\n(chorus)\n\n\n\nThere's a dark cloud rising from the desert floor\n\nI packed my bags and I'm heading straight into the storm\n\nGonna be a twister to blow everything down\n\nThat ain't got the faith to stand its ground\n\nBlow away the dreams that tear you apart\n\nBlow away the dreams that break your heart\n\nBlow away the lies that leave you nothing but lost and brokenhearted\n\n\n\n(chorus)"
