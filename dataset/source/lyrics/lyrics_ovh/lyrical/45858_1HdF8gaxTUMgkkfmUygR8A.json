  "lyrics": "You are just a bee-sting\r\nSwollen in my chest\r\nSomething must have died for\r\nYou to be my best yet\r\nA new accomodation\n\nTo go out on my own\n\nCivilised the stars that\n\nOnly shine alone\n\n\n\nI tried, I tried, I tried\n\nI tried, I tried, I tried\n\n\n\nBloated beating heartache\n\nYour face singes mine\n\nMutual decision\n\nTo disconnect the phone-line\n\n\n\nI reinforce the railway track\n\nWhich has sometimes stayed\n\nBut I made them too strong\n\nFor your wild ways, oh\n\n\n\nI tried, I tried, I tried\n\nI tried, I tried, I tried\n\nI tried, I tried, I tried\n\nI tried, I tried, I tried"
