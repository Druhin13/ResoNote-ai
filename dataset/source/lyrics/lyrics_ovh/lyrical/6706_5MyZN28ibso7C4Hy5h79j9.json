  "lyrics": "I'm a ghost\r\nWalking in a boring dream\r\nYou are there\r\nTalking and I'm not listening\r\nI am busy doing nothing\r\nAnd you're rudely interrupting\n\n\n\nIt's a myth and now I see it clearly\n\nYou don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing\n\nNow I'm calm and content\n\nOne more burden off my back\n\n\n\nYou don't wanna be a creator\n\nDoesn't mean you've got nothing to say\n\nPut down the pen, don't let it force your hand\n\n\n\nI'm a ghost\n\nWalking on an empty street\n\nNo name anymore\n\nNo need to call for me\n\nI'm a long-lost hometown hero\n\nLate to legendary past lives within me\n\n\n\nIf I had the offer to do it again\n\nMake me invincible, invisible, or brain dead\n\nIf the body and the life were two things that we could divide\n\nI'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else\n\n\n\nYou don't wanna be a creator\n\nDoesn't mean you've got nothing to say\n\nPut down the pen, don't let it force your hand\n\n\n\nYou don't wanna be a leader\n\nDoesn't mean you don't know the way\n\nHold your own hand, walk on without a plan"
