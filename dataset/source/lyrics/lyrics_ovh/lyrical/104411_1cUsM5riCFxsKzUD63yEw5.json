  "lyrics": "Well every once in awhile, she'll find my number in her phone and we'll talk for hours\nShe'll tell me things I've never known about when we were together\nShe's saying sorry, it's just such a long walk home\nSo she's coming over cause it's better than being alone\n\nAnd I will move to the city and I will sleep on a bench in central park\n\nAnd I will make new friends; we will keep all our things in shopping carts\n\nAnd when the cops come to find me, my new friends will hide me\n\nAnd we will steal whatever we need for fun\n\nAnd if they get suspicious, me and all my new friends will run\n\n\n\nI'm not gonna sit here and deny what I'm pretty sure I felt\n\nI want what we had, just wanna feel it with someone else\n\n\n\nWell every once in a while, she'll stumble on my number in her phone\n\nAnd she drinks too much. I got to get my number out of her phone\n\nBecause she has the nerve to call me and tell me she loves me, and that she is tired of being alone\n\nSo she's coming over cause I'm a bitch and don't know how to say no\n\n\n\nI just wasn't ready, I just wasn't cool yet (No, no, I just wasn't)\n\nI didn't know what I wanted (No, no, I just wasn't)\n\nBut I should have known what I would probably get (No, no, I just wasn't)\n\n\n\nI'm not gonna sit here and deny what I'm pretty sure I felt\n\nI want what we had, just wanna feel it with someone else."
