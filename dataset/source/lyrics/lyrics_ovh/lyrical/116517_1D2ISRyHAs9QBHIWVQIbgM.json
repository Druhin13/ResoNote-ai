  "lyrics": "My circuits have blown\r\nI know it's self imposed\r\nAnd all I have shared, and all I have loved\r\nIs all I'll ever own\r\nBut something has changed\n\nI feel so alive\n\nMy life just blew up, I'll give it all up\n\nI'll depressurise\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, ten thousand miles left on the road\n\nOh, oh, oh, five-hundred hours 'till I am home\n\n\n\nI need something human, human\n\nHuman, human\n\n\n\nLet's face all our fears\n\nCome out of the shade\n\nLet's burn all the money, absolve all the lies\n\nAnd wake up unscathed\n\n\n\nThe big picture's gone\n\nReplaced with visions of you\n\nNow life can begin, I've cleansed all my sins\n\nI'm about to break through\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, five thousand miles left on the road\n\nOh, oh, oh, two-hundred hours 'till I am home\n\n\n\nI need something human, human\n\nHuman, human\n\nAnd I need the touch\n\nAnd something human, human\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, less than a mile left on the road\n\nOh, oh, oh, I will be crawling through your door\n\nI need something human, human\n\nHuman, human\n\n\n\nAnd I need your love\n\nI need something human, human"
