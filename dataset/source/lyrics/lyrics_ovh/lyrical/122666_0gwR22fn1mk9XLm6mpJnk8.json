  "lyrics": "Funny how a blessing feels just like a curse\r\nBad love hurts, but somehow good love hurts me worse\r\n'Cause lately I'm mistaking honey for the bees\r\nHaving troubles sleeping with you next to me\r\nI sink in you like water\n\nPray you won't pull me under\n\nOne look and I die, heaven in your eyes\n\nHeld hard in the white light\n\nI dive in you like water\n\nI sink like a—\n\n\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water\n\n\n\nTell the truth, you know you can not keep me safe\n\nThere's more pain in love than we can find in hate\n\nLately I've been keeping honey from the bees\n\nSo if you ever leave, at least it's bittersweet\n\n\n\nI sink in you like water\n\nPray you won't pull me under\n\nOne look and I die, heaven in your eyes\n\nHeld hard in the white light\n\nI dive in you like water\n\nI sink like a—\n\n\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water\n\n\n\nBe gentle with me\n\nHave patience with me, oh\n\n'Cause I've been in the corner of my mind that tells me\n\nI'm not good enough for anybody like you\n\nHelp me out, you know I need you like water\n\n\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water\n\nStone in your water"
