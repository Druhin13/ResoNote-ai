  "lyrics": "I find myself daydreaming of a better world\r\nMemories can bleed in my open heart\r\nLondon clouds are crying, but I'm dancing in the pouring rain\r\nGrown up life is to learn not to fall apart\r\nAnd I'm closer to high vibrations\n\nEarning of the sweeter and deeper waves\n\nAnd what I can do, to make it\n\nTo be at peace, and be true to me, in every way\n\n\n\nI know I'll be alright\n\nI know that I'll survive\n\nI know I'll rise above it\n\n'Cause I believe in love\n\nAnd even when it's hard\n\nLivin' with my scars\n\nIt never mounts to nothing\n\n'Cause I believe in love\n\n\n\nNobody tells me how to grow, no\n\nI just gotta know\n\nEmotional, but I won’t define myself on the past\n\nBalance is key, understanding I can won’t be always in control\n\nSometimes the right road goes by taking the broken path\n\n\n\nNow I'm closer to high vibrations\n\nEarning of the sweeter and deeper waves\n\nAnd what I can do, to make it\n\nTo be at peace, be true to me, in every way\n\n\n\nI know I'll be alright\n\nI know that I'll survive\n\nI know I'll rise above it\n\n'Cause I believe in love\n\nAnd even when it's hard\n\nLivin' with my scars\n\nIt never mounts to nothing\n\n'Cause I believe in love\n\n\n\nYes\n\nKeep it simple\n\nFollow my heart\n\nThis love I’m into, yes\n\nCan't rush the art of trust now\n\nThe more that time flies away\n\nThe closer it feels to wise with age\n\nNo energy is giving me life\n\n\n\n‘Cause I believe in love \n\n(I believe, I believe in love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I believe)\n\n‘Cause I believe in love \n\n(I believe, I believe in love, ooh yeah, yeah)\n\n‘Cause I believe in love \n\n(I believe, woah-oah-oah)\n\nOhh, ‘cause I believe in love \n\n(I believe in love)\n\nI believe in love\n\n\n\nAnd we're done"
