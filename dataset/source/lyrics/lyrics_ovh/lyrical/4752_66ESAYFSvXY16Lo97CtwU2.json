  "lyrics": "I can heal it like your sounds babe\r\nI can feel it like your fears\r\nI can go another round your way, but I can't do this on my own\r\nI thought you'd love me 'til I'm raw, oh my God, mm\r\nI thought you'd love me till I'm raw, oh my God, oh my God\n\nIt's tough to face\n\nMy Phoenix rising crazy\n\nOh it's got a hold on me\n\nThis kind of love ain't stable\n\n\n\nSee all these ghosts dripping blood on this pain\n\nKill all these ghosts with slow motion explosions\n\nFeel my body through your fears and stains\n\nI'm coming fast, oh my God, oh my God\n\n\n\nIt's tough to face\n\nMy Phoenix rising crazy\n\nOh it's gotta hold on me\n\nThis kind of love ain't stable\n\nOh it's gotta hold on me\n\nThis kind of love (this kind of love) ain't stable\n\nOh it's gotta hold on me\n\nThis kind of love ain't stable\n\nOh it's gotta hold on me\n\nThis kind of love (this kind of love) ain't stable\n\nOh it's gotta hold on me\n\nThis kind of love ain't stable\n\nOh it's gotta hold on\n\n\n\nI finally brought my fate up\n\nI finally brought my fate up\n\nI finally brought my fate up\n\nI finally brought my fate up\n\nI finally brought my fate up\n\nI finally brought my fate up"
