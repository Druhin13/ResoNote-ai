  "lyrics": "What if I told you that we're all the same\r\nIf no one is equal in this endless game?\r\nWhat if I told you it's out of your hands?\r\nAnd after all is said and done, and nothing has changed\r\nYou all want the same\n\nYou again, the future, has failed us, it's coming round again\n\nThe sickness, the sadness, the cycles have to win\n\nSomehow, we're tilted and the ringing in my ears\n\nWon't go away, it's happening again\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you that we're all the same\n\nIf no one is equal in this endless game?\n\nWhat if I told you it's out of your hands?\n\nAnd after all is said and done, and nothing has changed\n\nYou all want the same, we all want the same\n\n\n\nHere we go again, the feeling of falling\n\nIt's all we'll ever know\n\nSwing backwards and forwards\n\nIt's getting old\n\n\n\nMy hands are tied behind my back\n\nAnd I can barely catch my breath\n\nAnd here we go again\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you that we're all the same\n\nIf no one is equal in this endless game?\n\nWhat if I told you it's out of your hands?\n\nAnd after all is said and done, and nothing has changed\n\nYou all want the same\n\n\n\nAnd after all is said and done\n\nWe can right the wrongs and make our own\n\nIn time to start it all again\n\nThe cycle's gotta break\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you that we're all the same\n\nIf no one is equal in this endless game?\n\nWhat if I told you it's out of your hands?\n\nAnd after all is said and done, and nothing has changed\n\nYou all want the same\n\n\n\nThe future has failed us, it's coming round again\n\nThe pendulum is broken, so we swing it by the neck\n\nInstead, we're tilted, the ringing in my ears\n\nWon't go away, it's happening again\n\nYou all want the same, we all want the same"
