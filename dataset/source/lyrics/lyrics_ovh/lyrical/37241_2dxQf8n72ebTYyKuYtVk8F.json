  "lyrics": "Don’t look away\r\nThis is now the moment that you know that you have waited for\r\nWait no more\r\nThis is your time right here\r\nNo one can believe something all the time\r\nYou fall out\n\nSomeday you’ll fall back in\n\nBut it’s coming for you now\n\nWith your hope burning in its hand\n\nThe armour you’ve grown\n\nYou will not fear them, breathing inside of the armour you own\n\nYou will not see them all waiting in line\n\nFor the armour you grow Is the armour you own\n\nBrace, this is just the game\n\nFind your shelter in your calm and take comfort in your harm\n\nDon’t look away\n\nThis is just the moment that you know that you create\n\nSo wait no more in this feeling\n\nYou will not see them all waiting in line\n\nFor the armour you grow Is the armour you own\n\nYou will reach\n\nYou will fall down\n\nEvery time you fail you will change\n\nYou will break open this light\n\nAnd from it you will know the way\n\nI won’t leave You will step out from the tower that has kept you safe Home will be where you are now\n\nKnow that this place must end\n\nKnow that this temple I built you’ll shed\n\nYou will awake to your consciousness\n\nStand up and know now that you are the one who shapes\n\nBut know when to give if the heart dictates\n\nShow all the empathy that you own with each moment\n\nKeep nothing safe, you will grow from harm\n\nThe further you fall you return to own\n\nKnow that you’ll always be chasing something\n\nAnd it’s ok\n\nYou will reach\n\nYou will fall down\n\nEvery time you fail you will change\n\nYou will break open this light\n\nAnd from it you will know the way I won’t leave\n\nYou will step out from the tower that has kept you safe\n\nHome will be where you are nowy"
