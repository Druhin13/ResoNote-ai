  "lyrics": "How am I supposed to raise you when I'm so afraid\r\nOf all that I can pass down\r\nIt won't be just my name\r\nI've tried so hard to imagine our place\r\nThe tears streaming down from my face\r\nMy father meant nothing to me\n\nBut I hope I mean something to you\n\n\n\nGrab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight\n\nGrab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight\n\n\n\nHow am I supposed to move on when I'm so afraid\n\nOf the loneliness that I feel when the sun sets on your grave\n\nI guess the best thing I can do with my time is love every minute of life\n\nWhen the fact is I would rather curl up and die\n\nI can't breathe if you're not alive\n\n\n\nGrab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight\n\nGrab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight\n\nGrab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight\n\nGrab my hand, hold it tight, let the water take us tonight\n\n\n\nHow do I forget you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\nHow can I forget you\n\nHow can I forget you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\n\n\nMy heart will break over spilling your blood\n\nI'm lonely as death and I want to give up\n\nCause I can't keep breathing this pain in my lungs\n\nI'll never forget our love\n\nI'll never forget our love\n\n\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\nIf there is love, I hope it finds you\n\nLet the good dig inside you\n\nLet your love be the thing that defines you\n\n\n\nIf there is light it'll find you, don't be afraid\n\n\n\nIf we don't lose someone who we would die for\n\nHow do we pick ourselves off the floor\n\nAnd face each day as if we're not dying alone\n\nWe've got to love ourselves, that's how we respect our dead\n\n\n\nHow do I forget you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\nHow can I forget you\n\nHow can I forget you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\nIf there is light, I hope it finds you\n\n\n\nMy heart will break over spilling your blood\n\nI'm lonely as death and I want to give up\n\nCause I can't keep breathing this pain in my lungs\n\nI'll never forget our love\n\nI'll never forget our love\n\n\n\nIf there is light it'll find you\n\nIf there is light it'll find you, don't be afraid"
