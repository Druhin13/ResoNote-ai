  "lyrics": "Darker than the ocean, deeper than the sea\r\nYou've got everything, you got what I need\r\nTouch me, you're electric, babe\r\nMove me, take me from this place\r\nMovin' to the tempo, show me what it takes\r\nSpeeding up my heartbeat, playing in the flames\n\n\n\nKiss me, we're on fire, babe\n\nLove me, take me to outer space\n\nKiss me, we're on fire, babe\n\nLove me, take me to outer space\n\n\n\nCovered in your water and I'm feeling like a summer breeze\n\nSubmitted under power and you brought me to my knees\n\nUse me, you're electric, babe\n\nMove me, take me all the way\n\nWhisper in my ear, I'm the only one you're loving on\n\nTake advantage of the moment, you're the only one that I want\n\n\n\nKiss me, we're on fire, babe\n\nLove me, take me to outer space\n\nKiss me, we're on fire, babe\n\nLove me, take me to outer space\n\n\n\nMelting like ice on a summer day\n\nHold me like you mean it, take me far away\n\nBodies moving in, temperature rising\n\nTake me to the top then watch me fall in\n\n\n\nKiss me (Kiss me), we're on fire, babe\n\nLove me, take me to outer space\n\nKiss me, (we're on fire...)"
