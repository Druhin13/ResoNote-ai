  "lyrics": "It's been three months, since I lit one up\r\nBut I needed something on my lips to get me through\r\nI didn't see this coming, when I let you go\r\nI didn't think it'd be this hard\r\nGetting over you\n\nIf I was the one who called it quits\n\nWhy in the hell do I feel like this\n\nIf saying goodbye was for the best\n\nThen tell me why I'm such a god damn mess\n\nIf I was the one who broke your heart\n\nWhy am I so torn apart\n\nIf I was the one who lit our love and let it burn\n\nWhy am I breathing in this second hand hurt\n\n\n\nIf you hated me\n\nMaybe then it wouldn't cut so deep\n\nMaybe then I'd get some sleep\n\nKnowing you were dying, crying\n\nNobody told me how hard it is to be the breaker\n\nI've always only been the broken love\n\nIf you'd loved them so much\n\nThey'd both just feel the same\n\n\n\nIf I was the one who called it quits\n\nWhy in the hell do I feel like this\n\nIf saying goodbye was for the best\n\nThen tell me why I'm such a god damn mess\n\nIf I was the one who broke your heart\n\nWhy am I so torn apart\n\nIf I was the one who lit our love and let it burn\n\nWhy am I breathing in this second hand hurt\n\n\n\nIf you were the fool\n\nI probably would've stayed with you\n\nWould've waited for you and me\n\nGuess the joke's on me\n\nCause I'm just left her wondering\n\n\n\nIf I was the one who called it quits\n\nWhy in the hell do I feel like this\n\nIf saying goodbye was for the best\n\nThen tell me why I'm such a god damn mess\n\nIf I was the one who broke your heart\n\nWhy am I so torn apart\n\nIf I was the one who lit our love and let it burn\n\nWhy am I breathing in this second hand hurt\n\n\n\nThis secondhand hurt"
