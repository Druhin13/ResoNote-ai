  "lyrics": "The falling leaves drift by the window\r\nThe autumn leaves of red and gold\r\nI see your lips, the summer kisses\r\nThe sunburned hand I used to hold\r\nSince you went away the days grow long\n\nAnd soon I'll hear old winter's song\n\nBut I miss you most of all, my darling\n\nWhen autumn leaves start to fall\n\n\n\nI see your lips, the summer kisses\n\nThe sunburned hand I used to hold\n\n\n\nSince you went away the days grow long\n\nAnd soon I'll hear old winter's song\n\nBut I miss you most of all, my darling\n\nWhen autumn leaves start to fall"
