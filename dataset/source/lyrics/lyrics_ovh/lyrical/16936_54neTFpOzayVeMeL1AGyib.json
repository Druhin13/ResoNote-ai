  "lyrics": "I seen myself with a dirty face, \nI cut my luck with a dirty ace \nI leave the light on \nI went from zero to minus ten \nI drank your wine then \nI stole your man \n\nI leave the light on, \n\nI leave that light on. \n\n\n\nDaddy ain't that bad he just plays rough\n\nI ain't that scarred when I'm covered up \n\nI leave the light on \n\nLittle girl hiding underneath the bed was it something I did \n\nMust be something I said \n\nI leave the light on, better leave the light on. \n\n\n\nI wanna love \n\nI wanna live \n\nI don't know much about it \n\nI never did 17 and I'm all messed up inside \n\nI cut myself just to feel alive \n\nI leave the light on 21 on the run \n\non the run on the run from myself \n\n\n\nFrom myself and everyone \n\nI leave the light on, I leave the light on \n\nBetter leave the light on. \n\n\n\nCause I wanna love \n\nI wanna live \n\nI don't know much about it \n\nI never did, \n\nI don't know what to do, can the damage be undone \n\nI swore to God that I'd never be what I've become \n\nLucky stars and fairy tales \n\nI'm gonna bathe myself in a wishin' well \n\nPretty scars from cigarettes \n\nI never will forget, I never will forget \n\nI'm still afraid to be alone \n\nwish that moon would follow me home \n\nI leave the light on \n\nI ain't that bad I'm just messed up \n\nI ain't that sad but I'm sad enough \n\nGod bless the child with the dirty face who cuts her luck with a dirty ace \n\nShe leaves the light on, I leave that light on"
