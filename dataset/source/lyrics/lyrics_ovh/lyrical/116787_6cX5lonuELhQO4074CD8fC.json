  "lyrics": "In between, just a fling, in the rain\r\nIn between, in apartment and a front porch swing\r\nIn between, cheap and fancy, a guitar and a Grammy\r\nIn between, reckless and responsibility\r\nSometimes, I'm my mother's daughter\n\nSometimes, I'm her friend\n\nSometimes, I play grown up\n\nAnd sometimes, I play pretend\n\nSometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls\n\nAnd sometimes I just wanna scream \"I'm not a little girl\"\n\nI'm dumb enough to think I know it all\n\nSmart enough to know I don't\n\nYoung enough to think I'll live forever\n\nOld enough to know I won't\n\nIn between\n\n\n\nIn between beer and a basement\n\nIn a Napa Valley vacation\n\nIn between, home, town and a neon city\n\nIn between, underestimated, overexpectated\n\nWho I was and who I'm gonna be\n\n\n\n'Cause sometimes, I'm my mother's daughter\n\nSometimes, I'm her friend\n\nSometimes, I play grown up\n\nAnd sometimes, I play pretend\n\nSometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls\n\nAnd sometimes I just wanna scream \"I'm not a little girl\"\n\nI'm dumb enough to think I know it all\n\nSmart enough to know I don't\n\nYoung enough to think I'll live forever\n\nOld enough to know I won't\n\nIn between\n\n\n\nI'm half head up in the clouds\n\nHalf feet down on the ground\n\n'Cause it ain't that simple\n\nAs a number, sitting on a page\n\nWhen they say \"act your age\"\n\nBut you're stuck there in the middle\n\n\n\nSometimes, I'm my mother's daughter\n\nSometimes, I'm her friend\n\nSometimes, I play grown up\n\nAnd sometimes, I play pretend\n\nSometimes I'm a princess dressed up in ribbons and all curls\n\nAnd sometimes I just wanna scream \"I'm not a little girl\"\n\nI'm dumb enough to think I know it all\n\nSmart enough to know I don't\n\nYoung enough to think I'll live forever\n\nOld enough to know I won't\n\nIn between\n\n\n\nIn the end, in between\n\nIn the end, in between"
