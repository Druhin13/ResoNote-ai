Tell me where you at\n\nI know you like the speed but, baby, don't crash\n\n\n\nPlease, if you can\n\nDrop all your plans and come over here\n\nAh baby, won't you do what you can?\n\nDrop all your plans and come over here\n\nAh baby, won't you?\n\nDon't stop for nobody now, don't stop for nobody\n\nYou got that something I can't get from nobody\n\nPlease, if you can\n\nDrop all your plans and come over here\n\n\n\nHate when you hold all your feelings inside\n\nWon't you say some? Say some\n\nGirl, don't you spare me\n\nJust give me all of that you got, all you got\n\nYou know I'm ready\n\nYou know I'm ready, ready, ready\n\nYou know I'm ready, baby\n\nYou know I'm ready, ready, ready\n\nYou know I'm ready, baby\n\nYou know I'm ready, baby\n\nDon't forget it, babe\n\n\n\nPlease, if you can\n\nDrop all your plans and come over here\n\nAh baby, won't you do what you can?\n\nDrop all your plans and come over here\n\nAh baby, won't you?\n\nDon't stop for nobody now, don't stop for nobody\n\nYou got that something I can't get from nobody\n\nPlease, if you can\n\nDrop all your plans and come over here"
