  "lyrics": "Facing a crossroads we've come to,\r\nWeighted with sinking thoughts of heresy,\r\nIt's been slow,\r\nA good show just the same,\r\nBeen hanging on so long,\r\nHanging on for so long,\n\n\n\nOut of your arms into the absence pit,\n\nNo collection of words can describe it,\n\nCan describe it,\n\n\n\nA concrete conscience here is worth nil,\n\nPlacebo pill full of bitter comfort,\n\nBitter comfort,\n\n\n\nBeen watching, looking for (a) magic wand,\n\nBeen looking for providence\n\nand watching for (a) sign\n\nIf time will show\n\nthe reason for spreading these words\n\nThat ask for no sentence,\n\nThe absence of crime,\n\n\n\nShe said I still love you,\n\nI don't know if I want to spend the rest of my time with you\n\nThe rest of my life with you\n\n\n\nHigh on adrenaline it's a new day"
