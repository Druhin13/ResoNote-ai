  "lyrics": "My heart is beating loud, in perfect rhythm\r\nThere's beauty all around, that once was hidden!\r\nWaves crash all around me!\r\nBroken is how You found me\r\nI'm heavy like a stone, don't want to be alone now\r\nThe past is all I see, fading memories!\n\n\n\nSomebody hid the sun, in the midnight of suffering\n\nMy tears are falling down, and crashing like waves\n\nSomebody stole the day, and took Your light from me\n\nI'll never be the same, roll this stone away\n\n\n\nMy heart is beating fast, loud and clearer\n\nThe promises at last, are coming nearer!\n\nWaves crash all around me! Oh-ooh!\n\nBroken is how You found me!\n\nI'm heavy like a stone, don't want to be alone now\n\nWill this pain ever be, a fading memory?!\n\n\n\nSomebody hid the sun, in the midnight of suffering\n\nMy tears are falling down, and crashing like waves\n\nSomebody stole the day, and took Your light from me\n\nI'll never be the same, roll this stone away\n\n\n\nYou roll the stone away!\n\nYou roll the stone away-ay-'y-ay\n\nOh-ooh! Oh-ooooh!\n\n\n\nSomebody hears the Son, in the midnight of suffering\n\nMy tears are falling down, and crashing like waves\n\nSomebody stole the pain, a thief in the night came\n\nI'll never be the same, You rolled this stone away\n\nOoh, I'll never be the same, You rolled this stone away\n\n\n\nMy heart is beating loud, in perfect rhythm"
