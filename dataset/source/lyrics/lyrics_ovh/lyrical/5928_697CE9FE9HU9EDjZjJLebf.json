  "lyrics": "There’s no one around\r\nBut the two old-timers who visit when they’re in town\r\nThe credits are rolling as they walk out\r\nI get to my screen\r\nWith the phantom audience sat there waiting for me\n\nBut they don’t complain where I take a seat\n\nIt seems\n\n\n\nEven now, I still stop by\n\nMost stories look better wide\n\nAnd I feel at peace here, ’cause\n\n\n\nWhile the adverts might’ve changed\n\nThe popcorn tastes the same\n\nAnd in the end the day’s always saved\n\nSo once the picture stops\n\nI let the hours pass, distracted in the dark\n\n\n\nEven now, I still stop by\n\nMost stories look better wide\n\nAnd I feel at peace here, until\n\n\n\nThe lights come up bright\n\nWhen it’s over\n\nI step outside and I think I might get\n\nSome dinner somewhere nice\n\nTonight"
