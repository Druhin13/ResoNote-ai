  "lyrics": "Bottles and bibles\r\nLitter the floor\r\nAn all night revival\r\nPassed out around 4\r\nNow the preacher's been drinkin'\n\nBut it's hard not to do\n\nSince she ran out the screen door\n\nAnd swore they were through\n\n\n\nOh Lord, if you care, send a spirit down here\n\nCause the preacher's been drinkin' again\n\n\n\nBut it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow\n\nWhen everybody in town points a finger at you\n\nBut they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled\n\nThey don't know you at all, but they think that they do\n\n\n\nHe didn't believe her\n\nHe just knew she'd come home\n\nBut the nights kept a' crawlin'\n\nAs he laid there alone\n\n\n\nAnd he'd call up to heaven\n\nAnd he'd hope and he'd pray\n\nBut the line's always busy\n\nSince he went astray\n\n\n\nOh Lord, if you care, won't you answer his prayers\n\nCause the preacher's been drinkin' again\n\n\n\nBut it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow\n\nWhen everybody in town points a finger at you\n\nBut they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled\n\nThey don't know you at all, but they think that they do\n\n\n\nNow the bottles and bibles\n\nBroke out in a fight\n\nThe whiskey fought hard, son\n\nAnd took the victory that night\n\n\n\nThey found him a' layin'\n\nFace down by the stairs\n\nDressed up for a sermon\n\nNobody would hear\n\n\n\nOh Lord, if you care, send your angels down here\n\nCause the preacher's been drinkin' again\n\n\n\nBut it's a hard way to go, on the straight and narrow\n\nWhen everybody in town points a finger at you\n\nBut they ain't had to walk with the weight that you've hauled\n\nThey don't know you at all, but they think that they do"
