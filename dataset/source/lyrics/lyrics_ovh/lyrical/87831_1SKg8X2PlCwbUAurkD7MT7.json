  "lyrics": "Oh, now that you're gone\r\nNow that you're gone\r\nI feel so unsure\r\nAs I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor\r\nAs the music dies, something in your eyes\r\nCalls to mind the silver screen\n\nAnd all its sad good-byes\n\n\n\nI'm never gonna dance again\n\nGuilty feet have got no rhythm\n\nThough it's easy to pretend\n\nI know you're not a fool\n\nShould've known better than to cheat a friend\n\nAnd waste the chance that I've been given\n\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\n\nThe way I danced with you\n\nOh, oh \n\nNo, no never gonna dance again\n\nThe way I danced with you\n\n\n\nTime can never mend\n\nThe careless whisper of a good friend\n\nTo the heart and mind\n\nIgnorance is kind\n\nThere's no comfort in the truth\n\nPain is all you'll find\n\n\n\nI'm never gonna dance again\n\nGuilty feet have got no rhythm\n\nThough it's easy to pretend\n\nI know you're not a fool\n\nI should've known better than to cheat a friend\n\nAnd waste the chance that I've been given (no rhythm)\n\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\n\nThe way I danced with you\n\nOh, should have known better\n\n\n\nOh, tonight the music seems so loud\n\nI wish that we could lose this crowd\n\nMaybe it's better this way\n\nWe'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say\n\nWe could have been so good together\n\nWe could have lived this dance forever\n\nAnd no one's gonna dance with me\n\nPlease stay\n\n\n\nI'm never gonna dance again\n\nGuilty feet have got no rhythm\n\nThough it's easy to pretend\n\nI know you're not a fool\n\nShould've known better than to cheat a friend\n\nAnd waste the chance that I've been given\n\nI'm never gonna dance again\n\nThe way I danced with you\n\nNow that you're gone\n\nNow that you're gone\n\n(Now that you're gone) was what I did so wrong, so wrong\n\nThat you had to leave me alone?"
