  "lyrics": "The warden led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom\r\nI stood up to say goodbye like all the rest\r\nAnd I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell\r\n\"Let my guitar playing friend do my request\" (Let him)\r\nSing me back home with a song I used to hear\n\nMake my old memories come alive\n\nTake me away and turn back the years\n\nSing Me Back Home before I die\n\n\n\nI recall last Sunday morning a choir from off the street\n\nCame in to sing a few old gospel songs\n\nAnd I heard him tell the singers \"There's a song my mama sang\n\nCould I hear it once before you move along?\"\n\n\n\nSing me back home, the song my mama sang\n\nMake my old memories come alive\n\nTake me away and turn back the years\n\nSing Me Back Home before I die\n\n\n\nSing me back home, the song my mama sang\n\nMake my old memories come alive\n\nTake me away and turn back the years\n\nSing Me Back Home before I die"
