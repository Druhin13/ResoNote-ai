  "lyrics": "Some birds just sit useless, like fists\r\nI wrestle on TV but no one ever lets me win\r\nI lean on the wall like a broom\r\nConfused by the scope it all\r\nAny fool can tell the truth\n\nAnd no, I don't think I should\n\nAdd one to the sum\n\nOf all that you fear\n\n\n\nI’d love to take you down\n\nAnd leave you there\n\n\n\nIn my window, I have a twin\n\nI look out, he looks in\n\nHe has a point, I applaud\n\nMy goodness, my god\n\nIs it my fault the countrysides\n\nAre so full of suicide?\n\nI break bricks with my heart\n\nOnly a fool would call it art\n\n\n\nAnd no, I don't think that I should\n\nBe one of the sum\n\nOf all that you fear\n\n\n\nI'd love to take you down\n\nAnd leave you there\n\nI’d love to take you down\n\nAnd leave you there\n\n\n\nSo why fuss, why not bend\n\nLike a nail, hammered in?\n\nOh, times are tough\n\nIf I recall, oh, it ain't easy\n\nNo, not all\n\n\n\nAnd no, I don't think I should\n\nComplete the sum\n\nOf all that you fear\n\n\n\nI'd love to take you down\n\nAnd leave you there\n\n\n\nI'd love to take you down\n\nDown and leave you there"
