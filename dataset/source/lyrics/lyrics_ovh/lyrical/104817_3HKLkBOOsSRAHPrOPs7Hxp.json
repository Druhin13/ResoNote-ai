  "lyrics": "I was only wondering\r\nHour on the phone like\r\nFeel your reason start to shift\r\nYou really think you could give yourself away?\r\nHalf a moment living in the sunsets of our youth\n\nI killed a world, was it enough to turn us loose?\n\nYou never notice when my breathing gets loud\n\nBut give yourself a break\n\n\n\nAnother summer in your eyes\n\nAnother mind made up\n\nNothing ever made you mine\n\n\n\nPainting me powder blue\n\nLike the reflections in your room\n\nWe could just take a day\n\nActing around a double view\n\n\n\nTurned up with a cracked wrist\n\nHonoring intentions\n\nDancing in the pouring rain\n\nYou don't deserve to miss every chance you get\n\n\n\nI discovered that you wouldn't like to give up lust\n\nIt makes me wonder if you'd ever give me trust\n\nI heard you think I'm not the quickest catch\n\nBut you know I've got your flame\n\n\n\nIt's just a lovers bet to lose\n\nOne o'clock I'll turn round\n\nTo follow other paths you choose\n\n\n\nPainting me powder blue\n\nLike the reflections in your room\n\nWe could just take a day\n\nActing around a double view\n\n\n\nCounting the time in three\n\nLove's an illusion, hard to keep\n\nSplitting the dark in half\n\nTo make it all fall back in peace\n\n\n\nWe're chilling through like it's just another day\n\n(I'll take your word for it)\n\nWe'll treat the weeks like they're for free\n\nThough you softened your voice, I know exactly what you're supposed to do\n\nTo the slick other boys, I could say anything I wanted to\n\n\n\nIt's just a lovers bet to lose\n\nOne o'clock I'll turn round\n\nTo follow other paths you choose\n\n\n\nPainting me powder blue\n\nLike the reflections in your room\n\nWe could just take a day\n\nActing around a double view\n\n\n\nCounting the time in three\n\nLove's an illusion, hard to keep\n\nSplitting the dark in half\n\nTo make it all fall back in peace\n\n\n\nWe're chilling through like it's just another day\n\n(I'll take your word for it)\n\nWe'll treat the weeks like they're for free\n\nThough you softened your voice, I know exactly what you're supposed to do\n\nTo the slick other boys, I could say anything I wanted to"
