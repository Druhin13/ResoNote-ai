  "lyrics": "I decide to sit up here alone\r\nI wonder what it might be like to be devoid of brain or brawn\r\nWe're all one of us\r\nIn our lowest days\r\nWe still got to try to cry\n\nAnd in another week or two\n\nI might just split in two\n\nCan I ask for a different brain?\n\nOne that isn't quite the same\n\n\n\nAnd when it all went away\n\nWhat did you finally say to yourself as you lay there?\n\nWas it mine?\n\nOr was it just rehearsed in a dream?\n\n\n\nAnd when it all went away\n\nWhat did you finally say to yourself as you lay there?\n\nWas it mine?\n\nOr was it just rehearsed in a dream?\n\n\n\nAnd as I'm lying here alone in my room\n\nI wonder what it might be like to be devoid of pain or blue\n\nIt's all that we want\n\nIt's all that we need\n\nYou don't have to try to cry\n\n\n\nAnd in another week or two\n\nI might just split in two\n\nCan I ask for a different brain?\n\nOne that isn't quite the same\n\n\n\nAnd when it all went away\n\nWhat did you finally say to yourself as you lay there?\n\nWas it mine?\n\nOr was it just rehearsed in a dream?\n\n\n\nAnd when it all went away\n\nWhat did you finally say to yourself as you lay there?\n\nWas it mine?\n\nOr was it just rehearsed in a dream?"
