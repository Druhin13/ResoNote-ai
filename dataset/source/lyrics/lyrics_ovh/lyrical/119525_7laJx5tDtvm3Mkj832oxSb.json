  "lyrics": "When the sun goes down\r\nOn my side of town\r\nThat lonesome feeling\r\nComes to my door\r\nThe whole world, turns blue\n\nThere's a rundown bar\n\n'Cross the railroad tracks\n\nI've got a table for two\n\nWay in the back\n\nWhere I sit alone\n\nAnd think of you\n\n\n\nI spend most every night\n\nBeneath the light\n\nOf a neon moon\n\n\n\nIf you lose your one and only\n\nThere's always room here for the lonely\n\nTo watch your broken dreams\n\nDance in and out of the beams\n\nOf a neon moon\n\n\n\nI think of two young lovers\n\nRunning wild and free\n\nI close my eyes\n\nAnd sometimes see\n\nYou in the shadows\n\nOf this smoke-filled room\n\n\n\nNo telling how many tears\n\nI've sat here and cried\n\nOr how many lies\n\nThat I've lied\n\nTelling my poor heart\n\nYou will come back one day\n\n\n\nI spend most every night\n\nBeneath the light\n\nOf a neon moon\n\n\n\nIf you lose your one and only\n\nThere's always room here for the lonely\n\nTo watch your broken dreams\n\nDance in and out of the beams\n\nOf a neon moon\n\n\n\nBut I'll be alright\n\nAs long as there's light\n\nFrom a neon moon\n\nAnd I'll be alright\n\nAs long as there's light\n\nFrom a neon moon"
