  "lyrics": "(Jimmy Buffett and Matt Betton)\r\nI bought a cheap watch from a crazy man\r\nFloating down canal\r\nIt doesn't use numbers or moving hands\r\nIt always just says now\n\nNow you may be thinking that I was had\n\nBut this watch is never wrong\n\nAnd If I have trouble the warranty said\n\nBreathe In, Breathe Out, Move On\n\n\n\nAnd it rained, It was nothing really new\n\nAnd it blew, we've seen all that before\n\nAnd it poured, the Earth began to strain\n\nPontchartrain leaking through the door, tides at war\n\n\n\nIf a hurricane doesn't leave you dead\n\nIt will make you strong\n\nDon't try to explain it just nod your head\n\nBreathe In, Breathe Out, Move On\n\n\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n\n\nAnd it rained, It was nothing really new\n\nAnd it blew, seen all that before\n\nAnd it poured, the Earth began to strain\n\nPontchartrain buried the 9th Ward to the 2nd floor\n\n\n\nAccording to my watch the time is now\n\nPast is dead and gone\n\nDon't try to shake it just nod your head\n\nBreathe In, Breathe Out, Move On\n\n\n\nDon't try to shake it just bow your head\n\nBreathe In, Breathe Out, Move On"
