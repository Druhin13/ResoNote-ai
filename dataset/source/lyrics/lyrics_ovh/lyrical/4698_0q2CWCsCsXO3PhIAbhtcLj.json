  "lyrics": "In my hand is the gun I hold and I am locked and loaded\r\nComing for you\r\nI'm heading out running as fast as I can\r\nAnd even now I see that you're shaking too\n\n(Tick tock I hear a tick-tock start)\n\nIt screams hurry or else to my racing heart\n\n(Tick tock I hear a tick-tock start)\n\nAnd it keeps going and going no end in sight\n\n\n\nTrapped in a room that has never been warm\n\nI stretch out my hand frozen cold to the core\n\nMy path has been blocked like I'm locked up to die\n\nCan no-one hear me from the outside\n\n\n\n(Tick tock I hear a tick-tock start)\n\nAnd when it stops we will meet the start of the end\n\n(Tick tock I hear a tick-tock start)\n\nIt's all been leading to this\n\n\n\nI'm frozen no words to speak\n\nAll I can do is laugh to cope with the grief\n\nI'm frozen no words to speak\n\nAll I can do is cry, the joy breaking me\n\n\n\nTrapped in a room that has never been warm\n\nI stretch out my hand frozen cold to the core\n\nMy path has been blocked like I'm locked up to die\n\nCan no-one hear me from the outside\n\n\n\n(Tick tock tick tock start)\n\nThese days full of deceiving lies\n\n(Tick tock tick tock start)\n\nThe world keeps leaving me behind\n\n(Tick tock I hear a tick-tock start)\n\nThe sound alone is haunting me\n\n(Tick tock I hear a tick-tock start)\n\nIt's all been leading to this\n\n\n\nI'm frozen no words to speak\n\nThere's not a sound within this cold empty room\n\nI'm frozen no words to speak\n\nBut someone breaks the door to my disbelief\n\nI'm frozen no words to speak\n\nThere's not a sound within this cold empty room\n\nI'm frozen no words to speak\n\nBut there is nothing I fear\n\nNo, not anymore\n\n\n\nOnce again I take aim at the end\n\nAnd I fire breaking down every door standing in my way\n\nStray bullets fly, the gun recoils\n\nAs I cut my way through the me of yesterday\n\nI'll let the darkness live on inside me\n\nBut I'll say goodnight to the past as I walk away\n\nSoon under the stars, we will meet again"
