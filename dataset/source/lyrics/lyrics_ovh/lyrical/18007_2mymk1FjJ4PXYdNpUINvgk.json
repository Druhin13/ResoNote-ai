  "lyrics": "Late at night when I'm all alone\r\nNo distractions, nobody's home\r\nI'm not the person you think I might be\r\nI'm someone different, I'm free\r\nI'm free of you\n\nI'm free of you\n\n\n\nLate at night when I'm in my head\n\nNo one to bother me, no messages to be read\n\nI'm not the person I normally might be\n\nI'm someone different, I'm free\n\n\n\nI'm free of you\n\nI'm free of you\n\nI'm free of you\n\nI'm free of you\n\n\n\n\n\nLate at night, the light turns to blue\n\nI'm wondering if you're out there thinking of me too\n\nHave you ever thought you might not be what you believe?\n\nYou might be someone different, you might be free"
