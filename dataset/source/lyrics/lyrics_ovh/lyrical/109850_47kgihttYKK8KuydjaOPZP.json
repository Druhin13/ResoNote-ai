  "lyrics": "Well she could be like a song\r\nThe kind that with time always comes back on\r\nSomething tells me she's gone\r\nThere's no coats, there's no rhymes\r\nThere's no singing along\n\nI pushed her a little too far for a little too long\n\nIt's a little too late to keep her from\n\n\n\nHighways and byways that'll take her anywhere but my way\n\nThere's so many ways she could say goodbye\n\nRailways and runways\n\nFrom the way she was looking, I'm afraid that\n\nWhatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time\n\n\n\nWell she was like my guitar\n\nAlways waiting around just to be in my arms\n\nBut you can't play with a heart\n\nShouldn't ever have left her alone in the dark\n\n\n\nI couldn't see it back then\n\nAh but look at her now\n\nYou can't pick it back up once it's headed down\n\n\n\nHighways and byways that'll take her anywhere but my way\n\nThere's so many ways she could say goodbye\n\nRailways and runways\n\nFrom the way she was looking, I'm afraid that\n\nWhatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time\n\n\n\nI pushed her a little too far for a little too long\n\nGave her little choice but to get on\n\n\n\nHighways and byways that'll take her anywhere but my way\n\nThere's so many ways she could say goodbye\n\nRailways and runways\n\nFrom the way she was looking, I'm afraid that\n\nWhatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time\n\nWhatever the way, it's gonna be one way this time"
