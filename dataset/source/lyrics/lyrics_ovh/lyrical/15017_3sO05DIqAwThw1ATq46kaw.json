  "lyrics": "When you’re trapped in your doubt and anger\r\nAnd you’re wailing along\r\nLike you relish the fail\r\nWhen your life turns to be deception\r\nAnd you’re scratching the walls on your cell\n\nEach step requires mad devotion\n\n\n\nMindfall Remedy\n\nNo one else will catch you\n\nNo one else will catch your fall\n\nOnly you possess the key\n\nMindfall remedy\n\n\n\nAll those rules were dissembling a future\n\nAnd you feel like you burn in emotional hell\n\n\n\nWith the absence of love and compassion\n\nEvery stone is a mountain high\n\nEach step requires mad devotion\n\n\n\nMindfall Remedy\n\nNo one else will catch you\n\nNo one else will catch your fall\n\nOnly you possess the key\n\nMindfall remedy\n\n\n\nI feel my tower crumbling\n\nWith my resistance low\n\nI’m living in a vacuum\n\nI’m falling to the core\n\n\n\nIn the core of resistance\n\nTo face my inner self\n\nLies the key to my existence\n\nTo help myself\n\n\n\nMindfall Remedy\n\nNo one else will catch you\n\nNo one else will catch your fall\n\nOnly you possess the key\n\nMindfall remedy"
