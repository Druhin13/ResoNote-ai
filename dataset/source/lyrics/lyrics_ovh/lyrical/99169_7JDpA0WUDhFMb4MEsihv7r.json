  "lyrics": "When I was feeling heavy\r\nLike the light had left me\r\nHe said come and let me\r\nCurl up beside you honey\r\nWhen your world is feeling heavy\r\nYou can lay your armor on me\n\nYou can lay your head down on me\n\n\n\nHe said slow down slow down\n\nWe're moving to a new sound\n\nWe're spinning 'cause we know now\n\nWe survived\n\nAnd now we get to fly\n\n\n\nWaking up after the storm\n\nI said Is there anybody left to search for\n\nComing up from underground\n\nIs there any of me left to be found\n\nOh it should've never come to this\n\nI wish that it never woulda come to this\n\nHe said don't fear the emptiness\n\nPain and love they coexist\n\n\n\nSo pour a little light\n\nPour a little light on me\n\nPour a little light\n\nPour a little light on me\n\nPour a little light\n\nPour a little light on me\n\n\n\nWe are knights in shining armor\n\nWith treasure to discover\n\nEver-after lovers\n\nSo pour a little light on me\n\nPour a little light on me\n\nâ€˜Cause now we get to fly"
