  "lyrics": "She don't wanna write a song\r\nShe knows exactly when and where and what went wrong\r\nBesides it's been too long\r\nShe don't mean to be a drag\r\nShe's just indifferent to the old blue fact\n\nThat you can't go back\n\n\n\nShe's the only one who can take you to a pawn shop\n\nAnd sell you for twice what you're worth\n\nNobody tells you it hurts to be loved\n\n\n\nAnd one day you will realize\n\nYou are nothing, nothing without her\n\nYou're an asshole from a bar\n\nOn a break, in a break room\n\nAnd you're never happy\n\n\n\n'Cause she's the only one who can take you to a pawn shop\n\nAnd sell you for twice what you're worth\n\nNobody tells you it hurts to be loved"
