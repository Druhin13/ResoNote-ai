  "lyrics": "I can't run but\r\nI can walk much faster than this\r\nCan't run but\r\nI can't run but\r\nI can walk much faster than this\r\nCan't run but\n\n\n\nA cooling system\n\nBurns out in the Ukraine\n\nTrees and umbrellas\n\nProtect us from the new rain\n\nArmies of engineers\n\nTo analyze the soil\n\nThe food we contemplate\n\nThe water that we boil\n\n\n\nI can't run but\n\nI can walk much faster than this\n\nCan't run but\n\nI can't run but\n\nI can walk much faster than this\n\nCan't run but\n\nOo-we Oo-we\n\n\n\nI had a dream about us\n\nIn the bottles and the bones of the night\n\nI felt a pain in my shoulder blade\n\nLike a pencil point? A love bite?\n\nA couple was rubbing against us\n\nRubbing and doing that new dance\n\nThe man was wearing a jacket and jeans\n\nThe woman was laughing in advance\n\n\n\nI can't run but\n\nI can walk much faster than this\n\nCan't run but\n\nI can't run but\n\nI can walk much faster than this\n\nCan't run but\n\n\n\nA winding river\n\nGets wound around a heart. Pull it\n\nTighter and tighter\n\nUntil the muddy waters part\n\nDown by the river bank\n\nA blues band arrives\n\nThe music suffers\n\nThe music business thrives\n\n\n\nI can't run but\n\nI can walk much faster than this\n\nCan't run but\n\nI can't run but\n\nI can walk much faster than this\n\nCan't run but\n\nOo-we Oo-we"
