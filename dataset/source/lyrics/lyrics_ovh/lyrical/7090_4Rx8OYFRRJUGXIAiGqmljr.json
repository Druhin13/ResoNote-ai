  "lyrics": "What does that say of me?\r\nWhen I know it's you calling but I let it ring\r\nTell me what's left of us\r\nShould this house feel as empty as it does?\r\nAnd where's the obvious light?\n\n'Cause I am tired and you're lonely\n\nScreaming \"babe, console me\"\n\nBut I've already given all that I have\n\n\n\nHas it all just come to this\n\nBoth wanting what the other cannot give\n\nAnd are we still trying to prove\n\nThis isn't something we'll grow out of like old shoes\n\n\n\nAnd where's the obvious light?\n\n'Cause I am tired and you're lonely\n\nScreaming \"babe, console me\"\n\nBut I've already given all that I have\n\n\n\nAnd if I was a softer person\n\nI could give you the kindness you are deserving\n\nBut I'm not\n\nAnd maybe that's just it\n\n\n\nAnd where's the obvious light?\n\nAnd where's the obvious light?\n\nWhere's the obvious light?\n\n\n\n'Cause I am tired and you're lonely\n\nScreaming \"babe, console me\"\n\nAnd I'd stop it if only\n\nOur hearts didn't break so slowly"
