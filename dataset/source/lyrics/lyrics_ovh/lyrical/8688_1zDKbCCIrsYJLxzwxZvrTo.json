  "lyrics": "You brushed your teeth\r\nAnd found your calling\r\nAt the bottom of a swamp\r\nThere was no air\r\nBut to be clear\r\nDarkness was all you wanted\n\nAnd now just floating to the surface\n\nHoping to find some kind of light\n\nRevised your look but something stinks\n\nAnd you will never smell right\n\n\n\nThere's a crooked line that runs\n\nThrough every crease in this map\n\nAnd you want to take us all the way back\n\n\n\nTo see the rot in no disguise\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nThe scum, the shame, the fucking lies\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\n\n\nYou've been carving tales for dummies\n\nOut of live oak and out of pine\n\nLet's turn your heroes into mummies\n\nThrow them straight onto the fire\n\nYeah just below the surface lurking\n\nA shadow breathing through a straw\n\nClinging to the myth that you were cheated\n\nYeah the myth that you were robbed\n\n\n\nAnd there's a crooked line that runs\n\nThrough every crease in this map\n\nAnd you want to take us all the way back\n\n\n\nTo see the rot in no disguise\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nThe scum, the shame, the fucking lies\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\n\n\nWe can't pretend to be surprised\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nThe seasons change and some survive\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\nOh what a time to be alive\n\n\n\nOh what a time\n\nTo be alive"
