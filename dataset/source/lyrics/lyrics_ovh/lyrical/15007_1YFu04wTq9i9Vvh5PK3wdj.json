  "lyrics": "There was light and clear skies\r\nThere was hope and endless dreams\r\nThere was love and no dying\r\nThere were forests as far as I could see\r\nSo make me feel like this\n\nThe tired and the hurt\n\nThe cold unbroken seas\n\nAnd everything we love\n\n\n\nThere was loss\n\nAnd there was fear\n\nA time to save was all we had in here\n\nThe were seasons of cold and dark\n\nCountless losses that we never saw\n\n\n\nSo make me feel like this\n\nThe tired and the hurt\n\nThe cold unbroken seas\n\nAnd everything we love\n\n\n\nSo make me feel like this\n\nThe tired and the hurt\n\nThe cold unbroken seas\n\nAnd everything we love\n\n\n\nSo make me feel like this\n\nThe tired and the hurt\n\nThe cold unbroken seas\n\nAnd everything we love\n\n\n\nSo make me feel like this\n\nThe tired and the hurt\n\nThe cold unbroken seas\n\nAnd everything we love"
