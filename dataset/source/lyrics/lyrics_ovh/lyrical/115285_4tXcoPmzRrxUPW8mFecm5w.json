  "lyrics": "Those West Coast lights you talked about in your sleep\r\nThe things you always thought that I could be\r\nThe skies will spread your wings 'cause this town's too small\r\nStars and moon, well I hope you got 'em all\r\n'Cause I'm still waiting on life to begin again\n\nStill waiting on love to give a second chance\n\nTo stop me and steal my breath the way you did\n\nI'm still looking for your Jeep in every parking lot\n\nStill taste your lips with every whiskey shot\n\nI hope you found whatever I ain't found yet\n\n'Cause I feel like all my better days are gone\n\nAnd I think you got 'em all\n\n\n\nThose dreams you prayed about but were scared to have\n\nThe smiles and the laughs, the greener the grass\n\nWell girl I hope you got 'em all\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm still waiting on life to begin again\n\nStill waiting on love to give a second chance\n\nTo stop me and steal my breath the way you did\n\nI'm still looking for your Jeep in every parking lot\n\nStill taste your lips with every whiskey shot\n\nAnd I hope you found whatever I ain't found yet\n\n'Cause I feel like all my better days are gone\n\nAnd I think you got 'em all\n\n\n\nAnd yeah those shells we found on the beach in South Carolina\n\nDoes the smell of a cottonwood tree ever remind you?\n\nOf those memories, of you and me, that I still see\n\nI hope you got 'em all\n\n\n\nGirl I'm still waiting on life to begin again\n\nStill waiting on love to give a second chance\n\nTo stop me and steal my breath the way you did\n\nI'm still looking for your Jeep in every parking lot\n\nStill taste your lips with every whiskey shot\n\nAnd I hope you found whatever I ain't found yet\n\n'Cause I feel like all my better days are gone\n\nYes I feel like all my better days are gone\n\nAnd I think you got 'em all\n\nMh-hmm, girl I think you got 'em all"
