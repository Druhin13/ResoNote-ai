  "lyrics": "Wake up, I've got a real situation\r\nSo we need to move time's wasting\r\nI could lose everything that I have\r\nAnd I'm not sure what I should do, it looks bad\r\nCan anybody shed some light\r\nHow do I transform death to life\n\nIs there a way that I pay the cost\n\nOr do I just fold and take the loss\n\n\n\nListen to yourself you sound so dramatic\n\nBro, I think you're coming at it all wrong\n\nStart fresh, you don't have to feel stressed\n\nThe trouble's all gone, it's a brand new dawn\n\n\n\nSo wake up, that's yesterday\n\nTurn the page, this story's ended\n\nMove on, it's over now\n\nThrow the towel in just forget it\n\nNo more, that's enough\n\nGive it up, you look pathetic\n\nGo now, dig the grave\n\nWalk away but\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nI won't let it die\n\nI won't let it die\n\nI won't let it die\n\nI won't let it die\n\nAt least I have to try, try, try\n\nAt least I have to try, try, try\n\nAt least I have to try\n\n\n\nHow did I miss the signs\n\nOr did I find out and it slipped my mind\n\nTruth is, I really didn't wanna know\n\nCause if I knew, I'd have to be responsible\n\nServed my just desserts\n\nAnd justice hurts the judge the worst\n\nI guess I've got to come down from the pedestal\n\nAnd try to find something incredible\n\n\n\nPlease stop dreaming, looking for a reason\n\nBelieving like that is hazardous\n\nIt's spilled milk, you don't have to feel guilt\n\nYou're not gonna bring back Lazarus\n\n\n\nSo wake up, that's yesterday\n\nTurn the page, this story's ended\n\nMove on, it's over now\n\nThrow the towel in just forget it\n\nNo more, that's enough\n\nGive it up, you look pathetic\n\nGo now, dig the grave\n\nWalk away but\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nYour faith is slipping through your fingers\n\nHopes and shorts apply\n\nFear and pain are closing in\n\nTo take away your pride\n\nYou can't relax and rest in peace\n\nAt least we have to try\n\nI'm here to fight, despite the odds\n\nSo God help me cause I won't let it die\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nWon't let it go\n\nCan't do it"
