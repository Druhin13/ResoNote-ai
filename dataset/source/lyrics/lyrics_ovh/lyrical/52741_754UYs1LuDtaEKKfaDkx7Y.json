  "lyrics": "Another bride, another June\nAnother sunny honeymoon\nAnother season, another reason\nFor makin' whoopee\n\nA lot of shoes, a lot of rice\n\nThe groom is nervous; he answers twice\n\nIt's really killin'\n\nThat he's so willin' to make whoopee\n\n\n\nPicture a little love nest\n\nDown where the roses cling\n\nPicture the same sweet love nest\n\nThink what a year can bring\n\n\n\nHe's washin' dishes and baby clothes\n\nHe's so ambitious he even sews\n\nBut don't forget, folks\n\nThat's what you get, folks, for makin' whoopee\n\n\n\nAnother year or maybe less\n\nWhat's this I hear? Well, you can't confess\n\nShe feels neglected, and he's suspected\n\nOf makin' whoopee\n\n\n\nShe sits alone 'most every night\n\nHe doesn't phone her; he doesn't write\n\nHe says he's busy, but she says, \"Is he?\"\n\nHe's makin' whoopee\n\n\n\nHe doesn't make much money\n\nOnly five thousand per\n\nSome judge who thinks he's funny\n\nSays, \"You'll pay six to her\"\n\n\n\nHe says, \"Now, Judge, suppose I fail?\"\n\nThe judge says, \"Budge right into jail\"\n\nYou'd better keep her; I think it's cheaper\n\nThan makin' whoopee\n\n\n\nYou'd better keep her\n\nI know it's cheaper\n\nThan makin' whoopee"
