  "lyrics": "Here’s a shot in the dark\r\nA chance I shouldn’t take\r\nIf I dive in again don’t let me sink\r\nYou could be the remedy\r\nOnly one dose and I’m out of sight\r\nI could be the drug trapped in your mind\n\n\n\nBefore you go\n\nTell me I’m worth dying for\n\nAll the things you were promising\n\nGive it up, put it all on me\n\nLose your grip and now it’s out of reach\n\nDon’t believe in what you cannot see\n\nAll the things you will never know\n\nIt keeps me, keeps me feeling low\n\n\n\nIs this all that we are\n\nA stitch that pulled apart\n\nYou told me I was your beat mistake\n\nThat you were taking the grave\n\nAnd I don’t know where to start\n\nSo tell me\n\nAre we taking this way to far\n\nPlease tell me\n\nI’m not a shot in the dark\n\n\n\nIs there something you want\n\nIs there something you need from me"
