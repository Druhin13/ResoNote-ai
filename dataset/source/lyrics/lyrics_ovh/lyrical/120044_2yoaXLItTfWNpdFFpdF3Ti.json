  "lyrics": "The show was ending and I had started to crack\r\nWoke up in Chicago and the sky turned black\r\nAnd you're so high, you're so high, you had to be an angel\r\nAnd I'm so high, I'm so high, I can see an angel\r\nI hear your heart beating in your chest\n\nThe world slows 'till there's nothing left\n\nSkyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants (oh)\n\nIn those heaviest days in June\n\nWhen love became an act of defiance\n\n\n\nHold on to each other\n\nHold on to each other\n\nHold on to each other\n\nHold on to each other\n\n\n\nAnd you were broken-hearted and the world was too\n\nAnd I was beginning to lose my grip\n\nAnd I have always held it loosely\n\nBut this time I admit\n\nI felt it really start to slip\n\nAnd choirs sang in the street\n\nAnd I would come to you\n\nTo watch the television screen in your hotel room\n\nAlways down to hide with you\n\n\n\nHold on to each other\n\nHold on to each other\n\nHold on to each other\n\nHold on to each other\n\n\n\nYou're so high, you're so high\n\nYou're so high, you're so high\n\nYou're so high, you're so high\n\nYou had to be an angel\n\nI'm so high, I'm so high\n\nI'm so high, I'm so high\n\nI'm so high, I'm so high\n\nI can see an angel"
