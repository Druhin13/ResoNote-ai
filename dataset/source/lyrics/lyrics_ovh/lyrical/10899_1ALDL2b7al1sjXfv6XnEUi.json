  "lyrics": "Why can't I tell you all of these feelings\r\nIt's so much easier when I'm dreaming\r\nI think my brain's about to short circuit\r\nI really wish I could find the words\r\nAnd now I'm crying under the moonlight\n\nI wanna call you up, but it's midnight\n\nWhat should I do with all of these feelings\n\nLike a Kaleidoscopic heart\n\n\n\nThe light that shines down from the moon\n\nWill guide the way\n\nAnd once again, it leads me to you\n\n\n\nThe constellations sparkle in my dreams\n\nAnd so I wonder if it's a blessing\n\nAs if by fate we're born on the same planet\n\nJust like a miracle romance\n\n\n\nSo let us have another great weekend\n\nAnd I will pray it has a happy end\n\nI'll still be here past, present, and future\n\nHead over heels in love with you\n\n\n\nI can't forget the way you looked at me that day\n\nWhen I met you the very first time\n\nWithin the sea of stars under the night sky\n\nI could still find you if I closed my eyes\n\nI love the way the world gives us moments\n\nThat we make our own destiny\n\n\n\nThis miracle will always remain a mystery\n\nCause once again, it leads me to you\n\n\n\nThe constellations sparkle in my dreams\n\nAnd so I wonder if it's a blessing\n\nAs if by fate we're born on the same planet\n\nJust like a miracle romance\n\n\n\nFighting evil by moonlight\n\nWinning love by daylight\n\nNever running from a real fight\n\nShe is the one named Sailor Moon\n\n\n\nShe will never turn her back on a friend\n\nShe's always there to defend\n\nShe is the one on who we will depend\n\nShe is the one named Sailor\n\n\n\nSailor Venus\n\nSailor Mercury\n\nSailor Mars\n\nSailor Jupiter\n\n\n\nHer secret powers all so new to her\n\nShe is the one named Sailor Moon\n\nShe is the one Named Sailor Moon\n\n\n\nShe is the one... Sailor Moon"
