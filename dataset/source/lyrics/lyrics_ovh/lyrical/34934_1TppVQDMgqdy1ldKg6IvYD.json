  "lyrics": "There are moments in our lives\r\nThat we feel completely alone\r\nWe feel as though, no one knows what we are going through\r\nIt is possible to be alone, and not live alone\r\nYou made me believe in something more than hurt\r\nIt is possible to feel alone\n\nI could, be your [?]\n\nAnd not work alone\n\nTwo-thousand miles\n\nShow love, show love\n\nMy mum is in my head\n\nI remember looking up at this really big tree\n\nAnd I was think about her smile\n\nShe brought me up to be free\n\n[?] read my word\n\nLight is hazy\n\nShow love, show love\n\n[?] read my word\n\nYou are not alone\n\nYou didn't make it where you are by yourself\n\nNo strange food for me\n\n[?]\n\nBe my [?]\n\nRise up, Rise up\n\nIf I [?] way"
