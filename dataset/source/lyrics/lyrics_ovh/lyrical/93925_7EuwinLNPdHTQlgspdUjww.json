So this what we came up with.\r\nI got up today\r\nAnd my flight was late\r\nOn my way to L.A\n\nI jumped up on a plane\n\nAnd put on my shades\n\nAnd threw on my head phones\n\n\n\nI was vibing to this beat\n\nThat made me move my feet\n\nBoy that thang was stickin\n\n\n\nAnd then I heard this melody\n\nThe dopest one I've ever seen\n\nSomething out the usual\n\n\n\nSo Mr. Pilot please\n\nI think I got a hit on you\n\nHurry to the studio.\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI'll play across the world\n\nAcross the world\n\nAcross the world\n\nI'll play across the world\n\nAcross the world\n\nAcross the world\n\nI'll play across the world\n\n\n\nWell I got up today\n\nPut some gas in my tank\n\nTo make it to the studio\n\n\n\nAnd then I heard this beat\n\nIt made me move my feet\n\nHell yeah that thang was super dope\n\nAnd then I sang this melody\n\nThe dopest one I've ever seen\n\nSomething out the usual\n\n\n\nSo Mr. Engineer\n\nTurn up the auto tune\n\nSo ill be on the radio\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nBeen around the world\n\nSame old songs\n\nNow on stage\n\nHit the bras and thongs\n\nLong way from what I came from\n\nFighting in the club\n\nFor just singing a song\n\nNow my passports full\n\nI'm outta pages\n\nNew places, new faces\n\nNew fans, all ages\n\nBlack, pink, purple, orange,\n\nCaucasians\n\n\n\nLatinos, European and\n\nAsians.\n\nIn Japan, they Knew all my lyrics,\n\nit was Amazing!\n\nThey spoke Spanish\n\n\n\nI guess its true what they say\n\nMusic is the universal language\n\nIt's a true blessing you know\n\nTo travel the globe\n\n\n\n[Chorus]"
