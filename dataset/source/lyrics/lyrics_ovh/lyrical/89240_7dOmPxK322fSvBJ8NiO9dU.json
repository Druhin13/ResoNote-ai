  "lyrics": "Flauntin' my body, my body, to people who just\r\nThink I'm somebody who sung a song that they knew\r\nAnd they hurted my body so good that they'll never know that I faked it\r\nAnd lately I'm getting too drunk at the same ol' clubs\r\nSo I'm livin' my life on a budget, tryna find love\r\nBut I don't want a lover who I'm only gonna love when I'm wasted\n\n\n\nI want something sacred\n\nI want something amazing\n\nAnd I'm going through changes\n\nI want something sacred\n\n\n\nI've been taking the money, the money\n\nPut on a face, but inside I feel funny, feel dirty, feel outta place\n\nAnd it's part of the journey they tell me, but I just want to escape this\n\n'Cause I know strangers better than my friends\n\nHooked on celebrity, doped up on jealousy\n\nAll these people just play pretend\n\nThere ain't no integrity, no\n\n\n\nI want something sacred\n\nI want something amazing\n\nAnd I'm going through changes\n\nI want something sacred\n\n\n\nI want something\n\nI want something\n\nI want something sacred\n\nI want something sacred\n\nSacred"
