  "lyrics": "Friday late night narratives\r\nThe soft touch of your hand, I wonder\r\nCould I taste a difference\r\nNow I'm no longer in demand?\r\nAnd I don't see it clearly\n\nMust have had too much\n\nBut I don't want it another way\n\nSee, I must be losing touch\n\n\n\nIf you see me with another\n\nAnother one who's in my arms\n\nJust remember not to bother\n\nI'm never gonna let you down again\n\n\n\nAnd if you catch me with another\n\nAnd not the one I spin around\n\nWhatever you may think of her\n\nI could never let you down again\n\nIt's all about trust\n\n\n\nGirl, don't look at the past when you're feeling low\n\nAs I might be up to something that you ought to know\n\nGirl, it's not our time or place anymore\n\nYou just should know I'm never going to let you down again\n\n\n\nSaturday's smooth injuries\n\nWe had it coming soon, I wonder\n\nCould I hear the difference\n\nNow that you've changed a tune?\n\n\n\nI rambled on so anyway\n\nOr can we call it quits?\n\nAnd is this what I need to take away?\n\nThis checkmate in my mind\n\n\n\nSo if you see me with another\n\nAnother one who's in my arms\n\nJust remember not to bother\n\nI'm never gonna let you down again\n\n\n\nAnd if you catch me with another\n\nAnd not the one I spin around\n\nWhatever you may think of her\n\nI can never let you down again\n\nIt's all about trust\n\n\n\nGirl, don't look at the past when you're feeling low\n\nAs I might be up to something that you ought to know\n\nGirl, it's not our time or place anymore\n\nYou just should know I'm never going to let you down again\n\n\n\nYou're on the other side and I\n\nWant to let you know girl\n\nYou're on the other side\n\nI'm never gonna let you down again\n\nYou're on the other side and I\n\nWant to let you know girl\n\nYou're on the other side\n\nI'm never gonna let you down again\n\nIt's all about trust\n\n\n\nGirl, don't look at the past when you're feeling low\n\nAs I might be up to something that you ought to know\n\nGirl, it's not our time or place anymore\n\nYou just should know I'm never going to let you down again"
