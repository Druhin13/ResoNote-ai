  "lyrics": "Where am I, with you\r\nWhat am I doing here?\r\nWhat's going on? Mother woah-woah-waoh-wipe away your tears.\r\nBecause I'm lost, mixed emotions can feel them fair.\r\nI need to find some parents in this hemosphere.\r\nWell, son. You've been gone for a long time.\n\nYou weren't right up, here in your own mind.\n\nTalking shit, living a wild new lifestyle.\n\nThat don't work in this system I'm afraid child.\n\n\n\nAnd I've been, so lost in my mind,\n\nI can't find a way back into life.\n\nAnd I've been, so lost in my mi-ind-i-ind-i-ind.\n\n\n\nNow I'm back why do I feel like an alien.\n\nDon't know how to act up in social situations but,\n\nDon't worry doc's giving me medication.\n\nPills in the morning, afternoon and evening but,\n\nBut do they know when they don't really know\n\nHow do you do, will paralyse myself\n\nI'm still lost without no-where to go-o-oh\n\nHow must I involve well am I calm and capable\n\n\n\n(I've become incapable oh)\n\nAnd I've been, so lost in my mind,\n\nI can't find a way back into life.\n\nAnd I've been, so lost in my mi-ind-i-ind-i-ind.\n\n\n\nBack to this maze\n\nBack to noting memoirs on this page\n\nBack to life, I mean so-to-so\n\nWe tryin to reach some goals,\n\nBut no this road ain't paved.\n\nOn the news it's just the same old thing.\n\n\n\nI've been lo-ost, and I've been well.\n\nAnd i've been here, so-o-o lo-ong.\n\nI've been lo-ost, and I've been well.\n\nAnd i've been here, so-o-o lo-ong.\n\n\n\nbum-be-dum-be-dum-be-doop-ee-dum-yeah\n\nbum-be-dum-bum, bum-be-doo-be-dum-bum\n\nbum-be-dum-be-dum-be-doop-ee-dum-yeah\n\nbum-be-dum-bum, bum-be-doo-be-dum-bum\n\nBe-dum-be-dum-be-dum.\n\n\n\naye, aye. I've been so lost."
