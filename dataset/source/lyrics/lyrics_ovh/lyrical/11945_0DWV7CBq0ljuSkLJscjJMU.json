  "lyrics": "Dressed in chains, now she waits\r\nLooking back upon that day\r\nWhen the dawn first held its gaze\r\nUpon the son and the daughter's face\r\nBut strange now it seems\n\nLike some dark and distant dream\n\nStill, she hopes and longs to be\n\nOnce again, and finally free\n\n\n\nSo she waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\nSo she waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\n\n\nShe's seen empires come and go\n\nWatched the kingdom's children grow\n\nSparks and embers far from home\n\nBorn to shine, and to behold\n\n\n\n'Cause on her chain is a lock and the key\n\nIs the radiance she will see\n\nFrom the light that's gonna be\n\nCast from the sons and the daughters free\n\n\n\nSo she waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\nSo she waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's a captive 'til she sees\n\nBy the morning light\n\nRedeemed sons and daughters\n\n\n\nShe waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\nShe waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\nShe waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\nShe waits, she waits\n\nShe waits\n\n\n\nIt's been a long time coming\n\nBut she hopes and she hopes for\n\nIt's been a long time coming\n\nBut she hopes and she hopes for"
