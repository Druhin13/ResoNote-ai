Oh-whoa, oh-whoa\n\nAm I here alone? Oh-whoa, oh-whoa\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd I say ooh, oh-whoa\n\nAre there really survivors?\n\nAm I here alone?\n\nI say ooh, oh-oh\n\nAre there really survivors?\n\nAm I here alone?\n\n\n\nI say oh, oh-oh\n\nAre there really survivors?\n\nAm I here alone?\n\noh-oh, oh-oh-oh\n\noh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nAre there really survivors?\n\nAm I here alone?"
