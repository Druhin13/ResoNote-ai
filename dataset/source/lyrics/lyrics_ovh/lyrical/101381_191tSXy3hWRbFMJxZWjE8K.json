  "lyrics": "I often close my eyes\r\nAnd I can see you smile\r\nYou reach out for my hand\r\nAnd I'm woken from my dream\r\nAlthough your heart is mine\r\nIt's hollow inside\n\nI never had your love\n\nAnd I never will\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\nAnd every night\n\nI lie awake\n\nThinking maybe you love me\n\nLike I've always loved you\n\nBut how can you love me\n\nLike I loved you when\n\nYou can't even look me straight in my eyes\n\n\n\nI've never felt this way\n\nTo be so in love\n\nTo have someone there\n\nYet feel so alone\n\nAren't you supposed to be\n\nThe one to wipe my tears\n\nThe on to say that you would never leave\n\n\n\nThe waters calm and still\n\nMy reflection is there\n\nI see you holding me\n\nBut then you disappear\n\nAll that is left of you\n\nIs a memory\n\nOn that only, exists in my dreams\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n\nI don't know what hurts you\n\nBut I can feel it too\n\nAnd it just hurts so much\n\nTo know that I can't do a thing\n\nAnd deep down in my heart\n\nSomehow I just know\n\nThat no matter what\n\nI'll always love you\n\n\n\nSo why am I still here in the rain\n\n\n\n(Grazie a alessandro per questo testo)"
