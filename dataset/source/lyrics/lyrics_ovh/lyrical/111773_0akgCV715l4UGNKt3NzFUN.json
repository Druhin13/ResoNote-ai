  "lyrics": "See the words appear on the wall\n\nThere for every man who's standing tall\n\nThis water's pure, the well is so deep\n\n\nThe only treasure that a man can keep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiles to go, and I feel the weight\n\n\n\nOf these chains that I create\n\n\n\nAs I climb to the top of the hill\n\n\n\nIt draws me still\n\n\n\nAnd I can't look back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\n\n\nThe heart keeps on burning\n\n\n\nOh, wheels, wheels, don't slow down\n\n\n\nMy soul keeps on yearning\n\n\n\nOh, wheels, wheels, roll me homeward bound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm looking through the eyes of a child\n\n\n\nLike the innocent and unbeguiled\n\n\n\nFrom the east, and far to the west\n\n\n\nSoldiers conquer in a royal quest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne by one, as the seasons change\n\n\n\nI press on in a world so strange\n\n\n\nAs I climb to the top of the hill\n\n\n\nIt draws me still\n\n\n\nAnd I won't look back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are marching in time\n\n\n\nTo the reason and rhyme\n\n\n\nAs the glory of youth starts to fade\n\n\n\nThere's no burden to bear\n\n\n\nFor a debt that is already paid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Chorus)"
