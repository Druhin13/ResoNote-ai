  "lyrics": "(Stevie Nicks)\r\nI took my love and I took it down\r\nClimbed a mountain and turned around\r\nAnd I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills\r\n'til the landslide brought me down\n\n\n\nOh, mirror in the sky - What is love?\n\nCan the child within my heart rise above?\n\nCan I sail through the changin'...ocean tides\n\nCan I handle the seasons of my life?\n\n\n\nWell I've been afraid of changin'\n\nbecause I've built my life around you\n\nBut time makes you bolder, \n\neven children get older\n\nAnd I'm getting older too.... (x2)\n\n\n\nI'm getting older too\n\n\n\ntake my love... take it down\n\nClimb a mountain and turn around\n\nand if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills...\n\nwell the landslide will bring it down\n\nand if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills...\n\nwell the landslide will bring it down\n\nThe landslide will bring it down\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to lorilys for correcting these lyrics)"
