  "lyrics": "I am yours, utterly,\nAnd I know you know,\nYou know,\nAnd you test me,\nSwallow me,\nBut I still won't go,\n\nStill won't go,\n\nAm I a fool,\n\nYour truth,\n\nEludes me,\n\nSometimes,\n\nAnd I can't play it cool,\n\nBecause you took away my pride,\n\nTaking me for granted,\n\nYou take advantage,\n\nI'll show you where you need to be,\n\nTaking me for granted,\n\nYou take advantage,\n\nI'll show you where you need to be,\n\nFollow me,\n\nI'll show you where you need to be,\n\nSaw the shores, ultimately,\n\nIt's yours, baby,\n\nEither you walk through,\n\nOr walk away from my open door,\n\nMy door is always open,\n\nBut you're not a fool,\n\nYour truths just elude you sometimes,\n\nAnd you play it cool,\n\nI'm just along for the ride,\n\nTaking me for granted,\n\nYou take advantage,\n\nI'll show you where you need to be,\n\nFollow me."
