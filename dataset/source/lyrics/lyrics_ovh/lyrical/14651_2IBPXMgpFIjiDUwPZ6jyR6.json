  "lyrics": "I sit on the table\r\nLay on empty bed\r\nIt's where I used to put my\r\nHead next to your head\r\nKeep a place so empty\n\nFill it with a thought\n\nSometimes it really shakes me\n\nSometimes it does not\n\n\n\nI wobble as I feel it\n\nComing out my mouth\n\nI know it will be better\n\nSo I leave the house"
