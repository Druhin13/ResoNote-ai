  "lyrics": "I don't feel the same\r\nI took all I could take\r\nHey rapture find me now\r\nI said I didn't mind when you stripped all my pride\r\nCause good love, good love is mine\n\nBroken wings, bones of coal\n\nI used to live clinging to his elbows\n\nThough I try to shake the lie, I live inside the sheen of every faint glow\n\n\n\nPast love, come back to yourself\n\nDon't keep reaching out to him, he can't help you now\n\nIt's a past life, so come back to the time\n\nIt's been far too many nights, and you still cry\n\n\n\nI woke up in the morn, I was feeling something's wrong\n\nTime take me I'm moving on\n\nThe night won't let me sleep\n\nI wish these days of the week would fade out\n\nFade out from me\n\n\n\nBroken wings, bones of coal\n\nNow every word I want to say, I swallow\n\nThough I try to shake the lie, I live inside the sheen of every faint glow\n\n\n\nPast love, come back to yourself\n\nDon't keep reaching out to him, he can't help you now\n\nIt's a past life, won't you come back to the time\n\nIt's been far too many nights, and you still cry\n\n\n\nAll you do is cry, all you do is cry\n\nAll you do is cry, all you do is cry\n\nAll you do is cry, all you do is cry\n\nAll you do is cry, all you do is cry\n\n\n\nPast love, come back to yourself\n\nDon't keep reaching out to him, he can't help you now\n\nIt's a past life, so come back to the time\n\nIt's been far too many nights, and you still cry"
