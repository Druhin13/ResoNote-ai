  "lyrics": "I cut through the Rockies like some unholy blade\r\nThe icy depths of the Pacific I have bade\r\nForever I wander, forever I stray\r\nThe rustle of wheat fields starts callin' my name\r\nCallin' my name\n\nLet me die in the country that I love the most\n\nI'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast\n\nA heart that lies far from the east or west coast\n\nThis plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home\n\nLongin' for home\n\n\n\nWell the north-folk are dandy, they don't mind the cold\n\nThe south has filled up both my belly and soul\n\nI know when I'm gray and I know when I'm old\n\nThese bones will cry out for the place they were born\n\nPlace they were born\n\n\n\nLet me die in the country that I love the most\n\nI'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast\n\nA heart that lies far from the east or west coast\n\nThis plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home\n\nLongin' for home\n\n\n\nI've met beautiful women, a pleasure to see\n\nRode [?] bikers and barefoot hippies\n\nJunkies and saints on my travels I greet\n\nBut far too few are homesick young plainsmen like me\n\nPlainsmen like me\n\n\n\nLet me die in the country that I love the most\n\nI'm a plain-to-see plainsman, and this I will boast\n\nA heart that lies far from the east or west coast\n\nThis plain-to-see plainsman is longin' for home\n\nLongin' for home"
