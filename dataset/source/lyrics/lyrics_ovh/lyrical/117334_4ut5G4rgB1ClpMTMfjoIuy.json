  "lyrics": "I've killed the demons of my mind\r\nEver since you came around\r\nWe are braver, running wild\r\nHow could I have been so blind?\r\nI just live a fast life\n\nForget about the past time\n\nI numb to escape my feels\n\nAnd friendships only passed by\n\nThe show and calling strobe lights\n\nWith you I feel something real\n\n\n\nAnd I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile\n\nTill the day I die\n\nOh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life\n\nTill the day we die\n\n\n\nHigh on life, till the day we die\n\nHigh on life, till the day we die\n\nHigh on life, till the day we die\n\nAnd I'd walk a million miles, just to see your smile\n\nTill the day I die\n\n\n\nThrough my fingers, out of sight\n\nHow could I have let you go?\n\nCutting corners, turning stones\n\nBut I can only feel a ghost\n\n\n\nI just live a fast life\n\nForget about the past time\n\nI numb to escape my feels\n\nAnd friendships only passed by\n\nThe show and calling strobe lights\n\nWith you I feel something real\n\n\n\nAnd I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile\n\nTill the day I die\n\nOh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life\n\nTill the day we die\n\n\n\nHigh on life, till the day we die\n\nOh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life\n\nTill the day we die\n\nHigh on life till the day we die\n\n\n\nAnd I'd walk a million miles just to see your smile\n\nTill the day I die\n\nOh, I need you by my side, we'd get high on life\n\nTill the day we die"
