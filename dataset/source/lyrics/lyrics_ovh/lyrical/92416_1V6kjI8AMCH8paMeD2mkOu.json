  "lyrics": "Is this all we get? One shot life\r\nTell me we got time\r\nI saw a world without you there\r\nSomehow, you were mine\r\nAnd no, please don't go\n\nPlease don't go and leave me alone\n\n\n\nDon't wanna give my heart to someone new\n\nWon't be anybody after you\n\nAnd even if one day, our time is through\n\nWon't be anybody after you, after you\n\nI'll never find another lover after you\n\n\n\nIf you have to go, be my ghost\n\nHope you haunt my dreams\n\nSo I won't be alone 'cause I'd give up hope\n\nIf you weren't there for me\n\n\n\nAnd no, please don't go\n\nPlease don't go and leave me alone\n\n\n\nDon't wanna give my heart to someone new\n\nWon't be anybody after you\n\nAnd even if one day, our time is through\n\nWon't be anybody after you, after you\n\nI'll never find another lover after you\n\n\n\nI won't be able to move on, baby\n\nI won't be able to love nobody else\n\nSo if you go, won't you take me with you?\n\nDon't leave me alone\n\n\n\nI don't wanna give my heart to someone new\n\nThere won't be anybody after you\n\nAnd even if one day, our time is through, whoa\n\nWon't be anybody after you, after you, oh, after you\n\nI'll never find another lover after you"
