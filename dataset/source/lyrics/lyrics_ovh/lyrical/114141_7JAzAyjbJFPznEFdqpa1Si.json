  "lyrics": "She says that the world is a broken mess\r\nIt's always on her mind\r\nShe cries at the news when the shots ring out\r\nEvery single time\r\nNo, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop\n\n\n\nSo I said, \"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes\n\nCan we live that real life, real life?\"\n\nOh, hey, \"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes\n\nCan we live that real life, real life?\"\n\n\n\nPrays on her knees when the towers fall\n\nTo a God she does not know\n\nShe's begging him to stop the mess\n\nAs the Boston bombs blow (Ooh)\n\nShe said, \"How could I ever believe in something\n\nThat would step aside and watch?\"\n\nAnd I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith\n\nBut I thank you for the day when everything will be okay\n\n\n\nBut no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop\n\n\n\nSo I said, \"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes\n\nCan we live that real life, real life?\"\n\nOh, hey, \"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes\n\nCan we live that real life, real life?\"\n\n\n\nI wish I had the answers\n\nSomething you could hold too\n\nOnly thing that's real to me is\n\nYou\n\n\n\n\"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes\n\nCan we live that real life, real life?\"\n\nOh, hey, \"Turn your phone off, only look me in my eyes\n\nCan we live that real life, real life?\"\n\n\n\nOh, hey (Real life, hey)\n\nReal life, real life\n\nOh, hey\n\nReal life, real life\n\nOh, hey"
