  "lyrics": "There's a few too many years on this hotel\r\nShe used to be a beauty you can tell\r\nThe lights down in the lobby they don't shine\r\nThey just flicker while the elevator winds\r\nAnd the couple in the corner of the bar\r\nHave traveled light and clearly traveled far\n\nShe's got nothing left to learn about his heart\n\nThey're sitting there a thousand miles apart\n\n\n\nBaby let's not ever get that way\n\nI'll say whatever words I need to say\n\nI'll throw rocks at your window from the street\n\nAnd we'll call ourselves the flagship of the fleet\n\n\n\nThere's a lady shining shoes up by the door\n\nand cowboy boots for seven dollars more\n\nAnd I remember how you loved to see them shine\n\nSo I run upstairs and get a pair of mine\n\nAnd there's a painting on the wall beside the bed\n\nThe watercolor sky at Hilton Head\n\nThen I see you in that summer when we met\n\nAnd that boy you left in tears in his Corvette\n\n\n\nBaby let's not ever get that way\n\nI'll drive you to the ocean every day\n\nWe'll stay up in the presidential suite\n\nAnd call ourselves the flagship of the fleet\n\n\n\nYou gotta try and keep yourself naive\n\nIn spite of all the evidence believed\n\nAnd volunteer to lose touch with the world\n\nAnd focus on one solitary girl\n\n\n\nBaby let's not live to see it fade\n\nI'll cancel all the plans I've ever made\n\nI'll drive and you can ride in the back seat\n\nAnd we'll call ourselves the flagship of the fleet"
