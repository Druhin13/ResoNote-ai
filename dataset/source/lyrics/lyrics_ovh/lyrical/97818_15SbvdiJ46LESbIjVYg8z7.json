  "lyrics": "Baby, don't you feel it\r\nFeel the way our hearts won't synchronize?\r\nTryna catch your rhythm\r\nKeep on missing, cadence won't align\r\nWell you push and I pull\r\nSay we're good but it's obvious, oh\n\n\n\nBabe, I know you feel it like I feel it\n\nNo, you can't deny\n\n\n\nSo if I looked in your eyes\n\nAnd I said it was time that we let this go\n\nIf I told you that my feelings faded\n\nAnd I need to let you go\n\nWould you put up a fight?\n\nScream and cry, \"Baby please don't go\"\n\nOr would you understand?\n\nWould you understand?\n\n\n\nI don't know what happened\n\nWhen it happened, when the passion died out\n\nLost sight of each other\n\nCan't recover, dimmed our colors down\n\nLay my head on your chest\n\nSay we're good but it's obvious, oh\n\n\n\nBabe, I know you feel it like I feel it\n\nKnow it's over now\n\n\n\nSo if I looked in your eyes\n\nAnd I said it was time that we let this go\n\nIf I told you that my feelings faded\n\nAnd I need to let you go\n\nWould you put up a fight?\n\nScream and cry, \"Baby please don't go\"\n\nOr would you understand?\n\nWould you understand?\n\n\n\nWould you understand?\n\nWould you understand?\n\nWould you release my hand?\n\nGive up all we had?\n\nWould you let it end?\n\nWould you understand?\n\nWould you understand?\n\n\n\nSo if I looked in your eyes\n\nAnd I said it was time that we let this go\n\nIf I told you that my feelings faded\n\nAnd I need to let you go\n\nWould you put up a fight?\n\nScream and cry, \"Baby please don't go\"\n\nOr would you understand?\n\nWould you understand?\n\nWould you understand?"
