  "lyrics": "Hello from my hotel room\r\nA thousand miles away and I am missing you\r\nIt's late at night, afraid that I\r\nI might let you down\r\nI'm staring at an empty page\n\nTrying to write the things I didn't say to you\n\nAnd we move so fast, the words get lost\n\nBut I hope that you know that\n\n\n\nYou deserve a symphony\n\nSoaring strings and tympani\n\nBut all I have's this melody\n\nWritten from my heart\n\n\n\nIt's a simple song and the words don't rhyme\n\nNo poetry between the lines\n\nOur symphony will come in time\n\nBut all I need to know tonight\n\nIs that you're still mine\n\n\n\nAnother sun another moon\n\nCan't look you in the eye and say I'll be home soon\n\nYou've been so good and strong for me\n\nStanding by my side\n\n\n\nI'm out here chasing the dream\n\nLiving up to all that I'm supposed to be\n\nMissing out on the one\n\nWho means the most to me 'cause\n\n\n\nYou deserve a symphony\n\nSoaring strings and tympani\n\nBut all I have's this melody\n\nWritten from my heart\n\n\n\nIt's a simple song and the words don't rhyme\n\nNo poetry between the lines\n\nOur symphony will come in time\n\nBut all I need to know tonight\n\n\n\nIs that you feel me with you\n\nEven while I'm gone\n\nAnd that you're holding on\n\n'Cause you and I belong\n\nIf I could send you all the love I have inside\n\nIt's in every song I sing\n\nIt's in every word I write\n\n\n\n'Cause you deserve a symphony\n\nSoaring strings and tympani\n\nBut all I have's this melody\n\nThat's written from my heart\n\n\n\nIt's a simple song and the words don't rhyme\n\nNo poetry between the lines\n\nOur symphony will come in time\n\nBut all I need to know tonight\n\nIs you're still mine\n\nYou're still mine"
