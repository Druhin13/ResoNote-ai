  "lyrics": "I am waiting for \nYou to come and bring me back\nI will lay here quiet\nHoney don't leave me out here all night\n\nNo, it ain't right\n\nThe way I talked and walked\n\nAnd left you far behind\n\nBut I saw your face\n\nAll day, all night\n\n\n\nIf we don't talk\n\nI won't mind\n\n'Cause it's the only way\n\nTo get along some time\n\n\n\nNow that I'm old\n\nI am not the way,\n\nThe way I thought I was\n\nI know it's hard\n\nBut you know\n\nWe'll make it, my darling\n\n\n\nIf we don't talk\n\nI won't mind\n\n'Cause it's the only way\n\nTo get along some times"
