  "lyrics": "(Hook)\r\nHe spares no one, he was forgotten\r\nBut he was somewhere\r\nSo beware of the stare of Ghostface Killah\r\nSo beware of the stare of Ghostface Killah\n\n(Verse 1)\n\nBeware, son, I got the stare of Medusa\n\nWith the rope tied around your neck, it won't get looser\n\nI might shoot ya, make your ass an example\n\nYou can't fuck with Tony Starks, get knocked, get trampled\n\nGet hunted like a rat in a field, I hate that\n\nHate fake ass niggas that love to set traps\n\nMurder the don, I'm back with a bird on my arm\n\nBack to pillage, I rock a live grenade as a charm\n\nI want bodies, DeLucas, spread into the waters\n\nI want mothers and sons, I wanna murder their daughters\n\nRevenge, all I see is blood in my eyes\n\nLike the rise of your worst nightmare come alive\n\nGhostface Killah, let's see who's gonna survive\n\n\n\n(Hook)\n\nHe spares no one, he's not forgotten\n\nCause he was somewhere\n\n\n\n(Verse 2)\n\nYo, look away, don't stare into the eyes of a killer\n\nMetal lungies, junkies, nigga, I pack the nine millers and thrillers\n\nBulletproof robes and wave caps\n\nRevenge more, nigga, you know Ghost gone stay strapped\n\nHunt them down in alphabetical order\n\nEach person that crossed me, watch the man slaughter\n\nThe butcher, the baker, the torturer, the taker\n\nI'mma send you right back to your maker\n\nA few extra holes, miss your soul sold to the devil\n\nIt's the rebirth of a slave brought back as a rebel\n\nI'm immortal, gonna kill generations of your fam\n\nYou tried to loathe my legacy away, but I stand stronger\n\nGFK, the pain prolonger\n\n\n\n(Hook)\n\nHe was a lonely man\n\nThey killed him\n\nCause they didn't understand\n\nThough his spirit possesses a rhythm\n\nAs the words on this record unleashes the Ghostface Killah"
