  "lyrics": "Been in and out of love since I was 19\r\nOpening my heart has left a bloodstain\r\nAnd I don't know how to make a man stay\r\nMaybe I've been putting my heart out in the wrong way\r\nAnd I'm bleeding\n\nI'm alright with it\n\nDarling, I'm alright with it\n\nI'm bleeding out\n\nI'm alright with it\n\nDarling, I'm alright with it\n\nIt's just a bloodstain\n\n\n\nThought I found the one when I was 23\n\nAnd when it was done, it nearly killed me\n\nI've got a little heart, not built for one night\n\nI give it all away even when I know it isn't right\n\n\n\nAnd I'm bleeding\n\nI'm alright with it\n\nDarling, I'm alright with it\n\nI'm bleeding out\n\nI'm alright with it\n\nDarling, I'm alright with it\n\n\n\nI'm gonna pull myself together\n\nGonna wait til it's forever\n\nGonna find someone who'll stay\n\nWho's not afraid of what I'm asking for\n\nI know love is never easy\n\nWith the scar it's gonna leave me\n\nI would rather love and bleed than never feel love at all\n\n\n\nAnd I'm bleeding\n\nI'm alright with it\n\nDarling, I'm alright with it\n\nAnd I'm bleeding out\n\nI'm alright with it\n\nDarling, I'm alright with it\n\nIt's just a bloodstain"
