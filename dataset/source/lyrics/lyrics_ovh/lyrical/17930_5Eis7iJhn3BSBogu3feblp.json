  "lyrics": "It's like breathing, so easy for me\r\nMy heart beating, it just comes naturally\r\nI don't have to try, and I can't explain it\r\nI've made up my mind and it ain't gonna change\r\nI've been loving you, loving you day after day\n\nAfter all this time, my loving eyes still see you the same\n\nDon't know what I'd do, what I'd do if you were gone\n\nI've been loving you, loving you too long\n\n\n\nI'm still falling like the very first time\n\nI can't believe I still call you mine\n\nIf you walked away, I'd still feel this way\n\n\n\nI've been loving you, loving you day after day\n\nAfter all this time, my loving eyes still see you the same\n\nDon't know what I'd do, what I'd do if you were gone\n\nI've been loving you, loving you too long\n\nI've been loving you too long\n\n\n\nIt's like breathing, so easy for me\n\n\n\nI've been loving you, loving you day after day\n\nAfter all this time, my loving eyes still see you the same\n\nDon't know what I'd do, what I'd do if you were gone\n\nI've been loving you, loving you too long"
