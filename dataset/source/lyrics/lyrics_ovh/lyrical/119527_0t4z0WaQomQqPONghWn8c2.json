  "lyrics": "Not everyone can be like me and Michael\r\nThe only problem is forgetting which side you're on\r\nSo you think the burning light will reappear on summer nights\r\nLike all the rest, but they can't find out\r\nIn every scene, it's me and Michael\n\nImaginary bombs raining down from the clouds\n\nSo it seems the losing side will never let the feelings die\n\nWhen all the best and brightest have gone\n\n\n\nMe and Michael\n\nSolid as they come\n\nMe and Michael\n\nIt's not a question now\n\nIt's me and Michael\n\nSolid as they come\n\nMe and Michael\n\nIt's not a question now\n\nMe and Michael\n\n\n\nNot every soul will sink like the setting sun\n\nToo happy with ourselves to notice when the change will come\n\nSo you think the losing side would never break the fine lines\n\nWhen sanctity wasn't a thing of doubt\n\n\n\nMe and Michael\n\nSolid as they come\n\nMe and Michael\n\nIt's not a question now\n\nIt's me and Michael\n\nSolid as they come\n\nMe and Michael\n\nIt's not a question now\n\nMe and Michael"
