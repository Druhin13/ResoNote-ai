  "lyrics": "Well tell the televangelist she's out of a job\r\n'Cause I look good on a cross and I can sure sing along\r\nOverrated, under-educated, simple and dry\r\nWho knew a man's fate was such a hard thing to find\r\nBut now I'm spending all my money on a badge and a gun\n\n'Cause shooting strangers in the back seems like a lot more fun\n\nI'll just walk around pretending I'm the only one\n\n\n\nNever listened to my teacher\n\nTrusted every word my preacher would say\n\nAlways thought the crosshair was simply the sun on my face\n\n\n\nBut if nothing dies tomorrow why remember yesterday\n\nWhen an hour or more of sleep might do you good\n\nIt's the wish I can't remember yeah it's the thing you'll never say\n\nOh, and I'd do it all again oh if I could\n\n\n\nSo fight your family and friends and let them know you're the best\n\nYeah tattoo \"radical\" right across your chest\n\nNo need for love, you were born to impress\n\n\n\nWell, everybody always told me if I made a funny face it would stay\n\nSo you better get hip, come and take a liking to me looking this way\n\n\n\nYeah, cause it's been years without a memory\n\nJust ears, a nose, a face\n\nYeah, just to find out fucking up was in your blood\n\n\n\nIt's the wish I can't remember\n\nIt's the thing you'll never say\n\nAnd you'd do it all again, oh, if you could\n\nYeah, you'd do it all again, oh, if you could"
