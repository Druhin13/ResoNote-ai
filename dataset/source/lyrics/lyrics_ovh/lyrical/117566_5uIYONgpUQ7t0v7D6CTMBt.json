  "lyrics": "I couldn't utter my love when it counted\r\nAh, but I'm singing like a bird, 'bout it now\r\nI couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted\r\nAh, but I'm singing like a bird, 'bout it now\r\nBites on above\n\nBut never would form\n\nLike a cry at the final breath that is drawn\n\nRemember me love, when I'm reborn\n\nAs the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn\n\n\n\nAnd I had no idea on what ground I was founded\n\nAll of that goodness is going with you now\n\nThen when I met you my virtues uncounted\n\nAll of my goodness is going with you now\n\n\n\nDriving alone, fall on your thorn\n\nHung like the pearl of some prey you had worn\n\nRemember me love, when I'm reborn\n\nAs a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn\n\n\n\nI fled to the city with so much discounted\n\nAh, but I'm flying like a bird to you now\n\nBack to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted\n\nAh, but I'm flying like a bird to you now\n\n\n\nI was hatched by your warmth\n\nThus transformed\n\nBut you're grounded and giving\n\nAnd darkening scorn\n\nRemember me love, when I'm reborn\n\nAs a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn"
