  "lyrics": "How many times must a girls heart break\r\nBefore she finally learns?\r\nThat every single word they say is fake\r\nAnd when they leave it burns\r\nI've got nothing left so you can take it\r\nPromise me you'll tell me when you're done\n\nBut if you find some hope you better break it\n\n'Cause baby, I don't like what I've become\n\n\n\nI don't like the silence sleeping in between us\n\nI don't like the feeling when you make me jealous\n\nI don't like the weakness, I don't like to lie\n\nHate the way you close down everytime I cry\n\nEvery time I wanna talk you make it so impossible\n\nEven when I'm innocent you're holding me responsible\n\nStrip another piece of me, take away my dignity\n\nNever show me sympathy and maybe I will learn\n\nMaybe I will learn\n\n\n\nHow many fires must a girl walk through\n\nBefore it finally rains?\n\nWill she wake up on the other side\n\nOnce the water drains?\n\nTell me all this fighting has a meaning\n\n'Cause I can't find the point of what we've done\n\nIf you care enough you better leave me\n\n'Cause baby I don't like what I've become\n\n\n\nI don't like the silence sleeping in between us\n\nI don't like the feeling when you make me jealous\n\nI don't like the weakness, I don't like to lie\n\nHate the way you close down everytime I cry\n\nEvery time I wanna talk you make it so impossible\n\nEven when I'm innocent you're holding me responsible\n\nStrip another piece of me, take away my dignity\n\nNever show me sympathy and maybe I will learn\n\nMaybe I will learn\n\n\n\nI don't like the silence sleeping in between us\n\nI don't like the feeling when you make me jealous\n\nI don't like the weakness, I don't like to lie\n\nHate the way you close down everytime I cry\n\nEvery time I wanna talk you make it so impossible\n\nEven when I'm innocent you're holding me responsible\n\nStrip another piece of me, take away my dignity\n\nNever show me sympathy and maybe I will learn\n\nMaybe I will learn"
