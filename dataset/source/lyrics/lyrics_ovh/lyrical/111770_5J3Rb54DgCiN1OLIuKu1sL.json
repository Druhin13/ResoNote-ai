  "lyrics": "Looking around, they're seeing all you've made\r\nI'm staring out into your eyes\r\nAll of the sighting on my problems fade\r\nThey run away in your light\r\nYou're there inside my questions, you're there inside my pain\n\nI'm filling up my lungs with your name\n\nI'm counting all my blessings no matter what I face\n\nAnd at the end of the day\n\n\n\nI'll be singing with the angels, with the angels, woah\n\nI'll be singing with the angels, with the angels\n\n\n\nHow could I stay inside my brokenness\n\nWhen I get a glimpse of your high?\n\nI'm holding on to all your promises\n\nAnd you pull me into your arms\n\n\n\nYou're there inside my questions, you're there inside my pain\n\nI'm filling up my lungs with your name\n\nI'm counting all my blessings no matter what I face\n\nAnd at the end of the day\n\n\n\nI'll be singing with the angels, with the angels, woah\n\nI'll be singing with the angels, with the angels\n\n\n\nI'll be, I'll be singing holy\n\nHoly, holy, holy\n\nI'll be, I'll be singing holy\n\nHoly, holy, holy\n\n\n\nI'm counting all my blessings no matter what I face\n\nAnd at the end of the day\n\nI'll be, I'll be singing holy\n\nHoly, holy, holy\n\n\n\nI'll be singing with the angels, with the angels, oh\n\nI'll be singing with the angels, with the angels\n\nI'll be, I'll be singing holy\n\nHoly, holy, holy\n\nI'll be, I'll be singing holy\n\nHoly, holy, holy"
