  "lyrics": "The Universe is ours tonight\r\nWatching the world go by\r\nSpinning in a blaze of lights\r\nSomehow I feel like I\r\nHave awakened a different life\r\nWhere everything could be alright\n\n\n\nHere there are no reasons to pretend\n\nOnly possibility that never ends\n\nThat’s all I need\n\n\n\nIn starlight we run, like wildfire\n\nAnd these hearts are burning for today\n\nFor once I belong\n\nAnd we are worlds away\n\nWe’re worlds away tonight, my love\n\n\n\nOut of the past we climb\n\nAway from the ties that bind\n\nI’m seeing it through different eyes now\n\nAnd we don’t even need to try\n\nJust let it go and watch it fly\n\nCause you and I could last a lifetime\n\n\n\nAnd here there are no reasons to pretend\n\nOnly possibility that never ends\n\nThat’s all I need\n\n\n\nIn starlight we run, like wildfire\n\nAnd these hearts are burning for today\n\nFor once I belong\n\nAnd we are worlds away\n\nWe’re worlds away tonight, my love\n\n\n\nAnd here there are no reasons to pretend\n\n\n\nIn starlight we run like wildfire\n\nAnd these hearts will never be the same\n\nFor once I belong\n\nAnd we are worlds away\n\nWe’re worlds away tonight\n\nWe are worlds away\n\nWe’re worlds away tonight, my love"
