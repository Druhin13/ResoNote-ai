  "lyrics": "Wasn't it the wild out here\r\nThat whispered I'm older\r\nAnd now nothing in myself rings more clear\r\nThan to leave and to hold her\r\nThe world is kind of tired and I'm just the same\n\nThe fires I long for the fires I blame\n\n\n\nTake it out, I'm down in my heart\n\nWhere the winds and the wires alone\n\nI hear them running the waves under me\n\nThe winds and the wires alone\n\nI hear them running\n\nAnd all I can say to you\n\nMy lonesome valley\n\nI'll fix my heart, and I'll be gone before the night\n\n\n\nBecause suddenly she's standing here\n\nDamn, I need my shoulders\n\nThey are lost from that time I just went\n\nBetween New York and Boulder\n\n\n\nThe world is a wonder but where to begin?\n\nThe fires that I long for the fires I blame\n\n\n\nTake it out, I'm down in my heart\n\nWhere the winds and the wires alone\n\nI hear them running the waves under me\n\nThe winds and the wires alone\n\nI hear them running\n\nAnd all I can say to you\n\nMy lonesome valley\n\nI'll fix my heart, and I'll be gone before the night\n\n\n\nAnd wasn't there a moment I thought I could dream here? forget about it. It's finally quiet, I'm finally free\n\n\n\nTo say to you\n\nMy lonesome valley\n\nI'll fix my heart, and I'll be gone before the night"
