  "lyrics": "It’s just another day when the words don’t paint the picture\r\nI should of seen the writing on the wall\r\nIt’s just another drink but when the whisky leaves my bloodstream\r\nWill the melodies & words make sense at all?\r\nSo whatever the weather, I’ll grit my teeth and fight the storm\n\nLet’s break down the walls\n\n\n\nI’m going to make it tonight\n\nI want to see my name in lights\n\nBecause we are, we are dreamers\n\nIt’s not impossible for me to have it all\n\nBecause we are, we are dreamers\n\nAnd it’s me against the world\n\n\n\nI tear up another page\n\nI write wrongs by forgetting all the verses\n\nStart afresh and find a purpose in some lines\n\nI thought that I’d found my way\n\nBut as we’re edging to the chorus\n\nThe nerves they got my tongue and swept me away\n\n\n\nSo whatever the weather, I’ll grit my teeth and fight the storm\n\nLet’s break down the walls\n\n\n\nI’m going to make it tonight\n\nI want to see my name in lights\n\nBecause we are, we are dreamers\n\nIt’s not impossible for me to have it all\n\nBecause we are, we are dreamers\n\nAnd it’s me against the world\n\n\n\nWhatever the weather, I’ll grit my teeth and fight the storm\n\nWhatever the weather, I’ll grit my teeth and fight the storm\n\nWhatever the weather, I’ll grit my teeth and fight the storm\n\n(lets break down the walls)\n\n\n\nI’m going to make it tonight\n\nI want to see my name in lights\n\nBecause we are, we are dreamers\n\nIt’s not impossible for me to have it all\n\nBecause we are, we are dreamers\n\nAnd it’s me against the world\n\n\n\nIt’s me against, it’s me against the world\n\nOh, it’s me against the world\n\nJust me against the world"
