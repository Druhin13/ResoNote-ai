  "lyrics": "Honey, how's that drink goin' down\r\nSeems a little still for 2 PM\r\nHoller if you need anything\r\nI've got an ear to lend\r\nI'll be right here cuttin' lines\r\nCountin' cash and stockin' beers\n\nI've got an idea what's on your mind\n\nSo in the meantime, think on this\n\n\n\nI've seen girls like you in here before\n\nWatched broken hearts break\n\nThough that door a time or two\n\nAnd I'll bet he packed all his things\n\nYou set out to curse his name and have a few\n\nAnd I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on\n\nWell, you're not the only lonely one\n\n\n\nThis ain't my first rodeo\n\nI've seen the other side of this bar\n\nPourin' salts on an open wound\n\nSittin' right there where you are\n\nAnd I know it probably stings right now\n\nSomehow more than that Jim Bean\n\nBut that clock on the wall will cure it all\n\nEven though that ain't how it seems\n\n\n\nI've seen girls like you in here before\n\nWatched broken hearts break\n\nThough that door a time or two\n\nAnd I'll bet he packed all his things\n\nYou set out to curse his name and have a few\n\nAnd I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on\n\nWell, you're not the only lonely one\n\n\n\nI've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go\n\nGirl, you ain't in this thing alone\n\nOh no, oh no\n\n\n\nI've seen girls like you in here before\n\nWatched broken hearts break\n\nThough that door a time or two\n\nAnd I'll bet he packed all his things\n\nYou set out to curse his name and have a few\n\nAnd I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on\n\nWell, you're not the only lonely one\n\nNo, you're not the only lonely one"
