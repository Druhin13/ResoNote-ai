  "lyrics": "Every thing about you says I should probably get going\r\nBut everything about me says I wanna stay right here\r\nEverybody's got some things better off not knowing\r\nThats just the same as us\r\nMight be a little dangerous\r\nHeard somebody say you're a little heart breaker\n\nSooner or later I'll wake up and you'll be gone\n\n\n\nThe way that you got me feeling right now\n\nGot me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong\n\nYou can break my heart all night long\n\n\n\nNo you\n\nYou're a little bit trouble\n\nNo you\n\nBaby that's just fine\n\nBecause you're easy on my mind\n\nEasy on my mind\n\n\n\nWhoever said nothing good ever happens after midnight\n\nHas probably never seen how the moonlight shines on you\n\nLet's take a little chance and our romance dancing in the headlights\n\nLet's lose track of time , with your skin on mine\n\n\n\nNo you\n\nYou're a little bit trouble\n\nNo you\n\nBaby that's just fine\n\nBecause you're easy on my mind\n\nEasy on my mind\n\n\n\nThe way that you got me feeling right now\n\nGot me thinking about how I don't care if they're wrong\n\nBecause you can break my heart all night long\n\n\n\nNo you\n\nYou're a little bit trouble\n\nNo you\n\nBaby that's just fine\n\nBecause you're easy on my mind\n\nYou're easy on my mind"
