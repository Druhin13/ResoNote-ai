  "lyrics": "Who's gonna care for the ones who care for the ones who went to war?\r\nThere's landmines in the living room and eggshells on the floor\r\nI lost myself in the shadow of your honor and your pain\r\nYou stare out of the window as our dreams go down the drain\r\nInvisible, the war after the war\n\n\n\nI get no basic training, I get no purple heart\n\nI'm supposed to carry on, I can't fall apart\n\nPeople look at you and thank you for the sacrifice you made\n\nThey look at me and smile and say I'm lucky you're okay\n\n\n\nInvisible, the war after the war\n\n\n\nBut I'm a soldier too, just like you\n\nServing something bigger than myself\n\nAnd I serve unseen, caught in between\n\nMy pain and the pain of someone else\n\n\n\nBut I'm stronger than you think I am\n\nI'm right here by your side\n\nI am not your enemy, I don't wanna fight\n\nThere's no going back in time, I know you're not the same\n\nBut you are not the only one for whom the world has changed\n\n\n\nInvisible, the war after the war"
