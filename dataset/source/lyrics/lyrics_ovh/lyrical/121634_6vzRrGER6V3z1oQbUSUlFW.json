  "lyrics": "No more lighthouses to deceive me\r\nJust leave me floating on the open ocean\r\nAnd let the moonlight take me anywhere on a tidal flow\r\nAnd if I capsize it's alright\r\n'Cause I've been feeling too invincible\r\nI need to know depths deeper than the deepest of connections\n\n\n\nThis autumn love is not enough\n\n\n\nIf there's no beacon tonight to guide me\n\nI'll finally break the shackles of direction\n\nAnd let the headlights lead me anywhere they wanna go\n\nI feel at home now out on a bough\n\nIn the lattice of the backbone\n\nWhere the highways are holding in the pieces of our broken hearts\n\n\n\nThis autumn love is not enough"
