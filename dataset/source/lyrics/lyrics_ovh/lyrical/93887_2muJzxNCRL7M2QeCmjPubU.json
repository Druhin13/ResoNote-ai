(Waste my time)\n\nOh, I see I’ve wasted time (Around again)\n\nWhen I've tried to please, yeah (Waste my time)\n\nMiss me when I waste my time (Around again)\n\nWhere I’ve come to be, yeah\n\n\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon’t go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nDon't go wasting my time\n\nI could not persevere\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nHow can I persevere?\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nHow can I persevere?\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nHow can I persevere?\n\nNo more wasting my time\n\nHow can I persevere?"
