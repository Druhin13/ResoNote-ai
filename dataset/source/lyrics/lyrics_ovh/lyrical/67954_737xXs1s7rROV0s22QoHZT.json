  "lyrics": "I bet you're wondering how I knew.\r\nAh, what you're plans to make me blue.\r\nWith some other guy you knew before.\r\nBetween the two of us, you know I love you more.\r\nIt took me by surprise I must say, when I found out yesterday.\n\nOh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)\n\nNot much longer would you be mine. (Not much longer would you be mine)\n\nOh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)\n\nAnd I'm just about to lose my mind.\n\n\n\nI know a man ain't supposed to cry.\n\nBut these tears I can't hold inside.\n\nLosin' you would end my life you see.\n\n'Cause you mean that much to me.\n\n\n\nYou could have told me yourself,\n\nOh, that you love someone else.\n\nInstead I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)\n\nNot much longer would you be mine. (Not much longer would you be mine)\n\nOh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)\n\nOh, and I am, and I am just about lose my mind.\n\n\n\nPeople say believe half of what you see.\n\nOh, and none of what you hear.\n\nWhoa, I jus' can't help being confused.\n\nIf it's true please tell me dear.\n\n\n\nDo you plan to let me go\n\nFor the other guy you left me for\n\nDon't you know that I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it through the grapevine)\n\nNot much longer would you be mine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)\n\nOh, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)\n\nOh, heard it through the grapevine.(Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)\n\nI heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)\n\nWoo, I heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)\n\nI heard it through the grapevine. (Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)\n\nOh, heard it throught the grapevine.(Heard it, heard it, I heard it, yes I heard it)"
