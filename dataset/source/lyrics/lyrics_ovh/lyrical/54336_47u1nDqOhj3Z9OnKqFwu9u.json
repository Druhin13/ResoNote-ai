  "lyrics": "They all laughed at Christopher Columbus\nWhen he said the world was round\nThey all laughed when Edison recorded sound\nThey all laughed at Wilbur and his brother\nWhen they said that man could fly\n\n\nThey told Marconi\n\nWireless was a phony\n\nIt's the same old cry\n\nThey laughed at me wanting you\n\nSaid I was reaching for the moon\n\nBut oh, you came through\n\nNow they'll have to change their tune\n\n\n\nThey all said we never could be happy\n\nThey laughed at us and how!\n\nBut ho, ho, ho!\n\nWho's got the last laugh now?\n\n\n\nThey all laughed at Rockefeller Center\n\nNow they're fighting to get in\n\nThey all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin\n\nThey all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat\n\nHershey and his chocolate bar\n\n\n\nFord and his Lizzie\n\nKept the laughers busy\n\nThat's how people are\n\nThey laughed at me wanting you\n\nSaid it would be, \"Hello, Goodbye.\"\n\nAnd oh, you came through\n\nNow they're eating humble pie\n\n\n\nThey all said we'd never get together\n\nDarling, let's take a bow\n\nFor ho, ho, ho!\n\nWho's got the last laugh?\n\nHee, hee, hee!\n\nLet's at the past laugh\n\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nWho's got the last laugh now?\""
