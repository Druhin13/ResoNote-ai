  "lyrics": "What kind of bastion of trust\r\nHit the stage with a straight face and jacket full of doves?\r\nWhere daisy-chained hankies vanish into plastic thumbs\r\nIt was classic misdirection, soulless magic to the young\r\nVia masters of deception\r\nThe full force court of volunteer\n\nPull a quarter out his ear\n\nIn a recession\n\nPull a rabbit from a Stetson as a rapper\n\nThough it's basically the same exact profession\n\nWatch, con artists give a fuck who the mark is\n\nWhether gorgeous or New Yorkers through the eye of Diane Arbus\n\nNo outstanding warrants, nothing up his sleeve\n\nI need you feeling weak and needing something to believe\n\nI need you feeling freakish\n\nThat's when I really flourish\n\nI wake up in a sword box\n\nI brush my teeth with bullets\n\nUnderneath some cosmic retrograde where patsies get their signals flipped\n\nHold on to your crystal pouch\n\nStep up to the thimble rig\n\n\n\nAnd for my next trick\n\nI'll make a dollar bill climb up out your wallet\n\nDisappear and reappear inside my pocket\n\nI never really do these things twice\n\nBut if y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\n\n\nIt goes scarves into wands\n\nInto flowers over common sense\n\nI'm all heart, rib cage housing a Svengali deck\n\nPick a card, tricky\n\nTurn a vic' into a bobblehead\n\nAbsconders into clingers-on\n\nKlingons into Romulans\n\nSaw myself in pieces for purveyors of the strange\n\nPut the pieces back together, though I'm never quite the same\n\nWe undermine the infantry where trickery let range\n\nFrom weighted dice to blowup dolls up in the carpool lane\n\nI'm charcoal with the art school lames\n\nI'm skateboarding with heshers\n\nSeen scepters shaped like feather pens and '57 fenders\n\nCarving knives and camera parts and canvas over stretchers\n\nAnd whatever make the project in the cellar go Excelsior\n\nAt the way my older bones that magically predict the weather\n\nHe like his eye on loot with pinch of pepper\n\nThe nerd rage scurry out a collapsible bird cage\n\nAce in the palm at the workplace, jerkface\n\n\n\nAnd for my next trick\n\nI'll make a dollar bill climb up out your wallet\n\nDisappear and reappear inside my pocket\n\nI never really do these things twice\n\nBut if y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\n\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might\n\nIf y'all ask nice I just might"
