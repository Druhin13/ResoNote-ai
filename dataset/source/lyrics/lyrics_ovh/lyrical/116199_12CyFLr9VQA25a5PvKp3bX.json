  "lyrics": "I hear you loud and clear\r\nThrough all the din and commotion\r\nI hear you loud and clear\r\nA constant ringing bell\r\nOr the ocean in a shell I held up to my ear\n\nWhile everything else\n\n\n\nIs breaking like the waves down on the coastline\n\nBreaking like the wine-stained glass that held my drink\n\nBreaking like the heart that's stuck inside my skin\n\nWill it ever beat again\n\nOr just go on bleeding 'til it's empty\n\n'Til I fill it up again\n\n\n\nI feel you baby\n\nThese aren't fighting words, just a declaration\n\nI feel you\n\nSo I guess I'll be going now\n\nI know you're looking out for new eyes in the crowd\n\nI'll see you around\n\n\n\nBreaking like the waves down on the coastline\n\nBreaking like the wine-stained glass that held my drink\n\nBreaking like the heart that's stuck inside my skin\n\nWill it ever beat again\n\nOr just go on bleeding 'til it's empty\n\n'Til I fill it up again\n\n\n\nShiny pieces underneath my feet\n\nShiny pieces\n\nThere's a far-off feeling, I can't shake it\n\nHold it in my hands but I'm not breaking\n\nShiny pieces all around me\n\n\n\nBreaking like the waves down on the coastline\n\nBreaking like the wine-stained glass that held my drink\n\nBreaking like the heart that's stuck inside my skin\n\nCome on, fill it up again\n\n\n\nFill it up again\n\nFill it up again"
