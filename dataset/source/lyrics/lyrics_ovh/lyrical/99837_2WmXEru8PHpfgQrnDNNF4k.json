  "lyrics": "In a city that lives while its bright stars die\r\nAnd you start to get old when you turn 25\r\nWhere else can you go when you've got that drive?\r\nAnd everybody says when they arrive\r\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nThe parking's cheap and valet\n\nThose blue skies day after day\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nBackyard got two lemon trees\n\nTen grams at the dispensary\n\nAngels all left, but we'll stay\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\n\n\n[?] walk the streets\n\nAnd the [?] smile with the whites of their teeth\n\nAll licking their lips for a quick fifteen\n\nYour appetite fades but you're still starving\n\n\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nThe parking's cheap and valet\n\nThose blue skies day after day\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nBackyard got two lemon trees\n\nTen grams at the dispensary\n\nAngels all left, but we'll stay\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nThe parking's cheap and valet\n\nThose blue skies day after day\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\nBackyard got two lemon trees\n\nTen grams at the dispensary\n\nAngels all left, but we'll stay\n\nIt's not so bad in L.A\n\n\n\n[?]"
