  "lyrics": "Blue river, let it run dry\r\nNo stopping the tears from the sky\r\nCome closer and share in my pain\r\nSteal from me and leave me the blame\r\nNowhere to go\n\nBut I'm not looking back\n\nSave me now before it's too late\n\n\n\nDifferent time, different place\n\nDifferent shoes but I'm walking the same\n\nDead end road with regret\n\nMemories I can never forget\n\nDifferent life, different name\n\nDifferent words but they sound the same\n\nWe're living in dark days\n\n\n\nRed fire, let it run wild\n\nNo conscience so steal from the child\n\nDeep into the flood again\n\nI'm drowning, no need to pretend\n\n\n\nNowhere to go\n\nBut I'm not looking back\n\nSave me now before it's too late\n\n\n\nDifferent time, different place\n\nDifferent shoes but I'm walking the same\n\nDead end road with regret\n\nMemories I can never forget\n\nDifferent life, different name\n\nDifferent words but they sound the same\n\nWe're living in dark days\n\n\n\nDifferent time, different place\n\nDifferent shoes but I'm walking the same\n\nDead end road with regret\n\nMemories I can never forget\n\nDifferent life, different name\n\nDifferent words but they sound the same\n\nWe're living in dark days\n\nWe're living in dark days\n\nWe're living in dark days, oh yeah\n\nWe're living in dark days"
