  "lyrics": "Well, they gave him his orders at Monroe Virginia\r\nSaying, \"Steve, you're way behind the times\"\r\nThis is not 38, this is old 97\r\nSo get her into Spencer on time\r\nWell, he turned around and said to his old greasy fireman\r\n\"Shovel on a little more coal\n\nWhen we cross that big, white mountain\n\nYou'll be watchin' old 97 start to roll\"\n\n\n\nWell, it's a mighty long road from Lynchburg down to Danville\n\nOn a line of three-mile grade\n\nIt was on that grade that he lost his airbrakes\n\nShoulda seen the jump he had to make\n\nThey were going down the grade at 90 miles an hour\n\nWhen the whistle broke into a scream\n\nHe was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle\n\nScalded to death by the steam\n\n\n\nWell, a telegram came from Washington city\n\nAnd this is how the telegram read\n\nThat the brave engineer in the old 97\n\nIs layin' out in Danville, and he's dead\n\n\n\nNow all of you ladies, take heed, and take warning\n\nAnd try to learn\n\nNever speak harsh words against your lovin' husband\n\n'Cause he may never return\n\nNo, he may never return"
