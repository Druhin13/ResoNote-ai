  "lyrics": "I met my love by the gas works wall\r\nI dreamed a dream by the old canal\r\nI kissed my girl by the factory wall\r\nOf this dirty old town, dirty old town\r\nDirty old town, dirty old town\n\nClouds are drifting across the moon\n\nCats are prowling over on their beat\n\nSpring's a girl from the streets at night\n\nDirty old town, dirty old town\n\nThis dirty old town, this dirty old town\n\n\n\nI heard a signal coming from the docks\n\nI saw a train set the night on fire\n\nI smelled the spring in the smoky wind\n\nOf this dirty old town, this dirty old town\n\nThis dirty old town, this dirty old town, yeah\n\n\n\nThis dirty old town, this dirty old town\n\nThis dirty old town, this dirty old town\n\n\n\nI'm going to make me a good sharp ax\n\nShining steel tempered in the fire\n\nI'll chop you down like an old dead tree\n\nDirty old town, this dirty old town\n\nThis dirty old town, this dirty old town"
