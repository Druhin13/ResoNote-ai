  "lyrics": "I feel your pulse steady like an 808\r\nIt keeps driving like a semi on the interstate\r\nSwerving left and right, coloring outside the lines\r\nWe gotta get before the getting's late\r\nI see the moon living in the rear-view mirror\n\nAnd every sign sayin' baby there ain't nothing here\n\nSo tell me everything, I'll be your amphetamine\n\nI'll be the whisper living in your ear\n\n\n\nLife's a little better living upside down\n\nHangin' from the heavens trying to touch the ground\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\nOur hearts keeping beating to the city lights\n\nRacing ever forward, never hit rewind\n\nNow we're the lucky ones\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\n\n\nSo be the blood rushing right into my brain\n\nAs your oxygen begins to take my breath away\n\nIt's just me and you, everything is turning blue\n\nLet's find each other in the fadeaway\n\n\n\nLife's a little better living upside down\n\nHangin' from the heavens trying to touch the ground\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\nOur hearts keeping beating to the city lights\n\nRacing ever forward, never hit rewind\n\nNow we're the lucky ones\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\n\n\nLife's a little better living upside down\n\nHangin' from the heavens trying to touch the ground\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\n\n\nLife's a little better living upside down\n\nHangin' from the heavens trying to touch the ground\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones\n\nOur hearts keeping beating to the city lights\n\nRacing ever forward, never hit rewind\n\nNow we're the lucky ones\n\nYeah we're the lucky ones"
