  "lyrics": "I woke up and called this morning\r\nThe tone of your voice was a warning\r\nThat you don't care for me anymore\r\nI made up the bed we sleep in\r\nI looked at the clock when you creep in\r\nIt's 6 a.m. and I'm alone\n\n\n\nDid you know when you go\n\nIt's the perfect ending\n\nTo the bad day I was just beginning\n\nWhen you go all I know is\n\nYou're my favorite mistake\n\n\n\nWell, your friends are sorry for me\n\nThey watch you pretend to adore me\n\nBut I'm no fool to this game\n\n\n\nNow here comes your secret lover\n\nShe'd be unlike any other\n\nUntil your guilt goes up in flames\n\n\n\nDid you know when you go\n\nIt's the perfect ending\n\nTo the bad day I've gotten used to spending\n\nWhen you go all I know is\n\nYou're my favorite mistake\n\nYou're my favorite mistake\n\n\n\nWell maybe nothin' lasts forever\n\nEven when you stay together\n\nI don't need forever after\n\nIt's your laughter won't let me go\n\nSo I'm holding on this way\n\n\n\nDid you know, could you tell\n\nYou were the only one\n\nThat I ever loved\n\nNow everything's so wrong\n\n\n\nDid you see me walking by?\n\nDid it ever make you cry?\n\n\n\nYou're my favorite mistake\n\nYou're my favorite mistake\n\nYou're my favorite mistake"
