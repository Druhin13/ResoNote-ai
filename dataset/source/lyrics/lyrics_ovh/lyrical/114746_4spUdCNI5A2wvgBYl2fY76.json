  "lyrics": "In a perfect world\r\nYou're understanding, I'm not a perfect girl\r\nI would drop my fears at the door\r\nI will only bring myself and nothing more\r\nAnd you let me be, a woman\r\nAnd you let me be, a fly woman\n\nYou would yearn to hear all about my past\n\nWhat I've done, what I've did\n\nIn my, below my sick thoughts\n\nAnd if I needed to, I could cry\n\nAnd you would catch my tears\n\nYou don't wanna be nobody else's babe, no, babe, no\n\nYou don't wanna be nobody else's player, to hide from themselves\n\n\n\nShame\n\nAnd I'm the one to blame\n\n\n\nYou see right through me\n\nYou see through the smile\n\nYou see straight through me\n\nYou push past the lies, oh\n\nYou got it baby\n\nOh, oh, oh"
