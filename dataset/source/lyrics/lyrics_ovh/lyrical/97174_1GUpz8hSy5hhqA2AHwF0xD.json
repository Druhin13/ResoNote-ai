  "lyrics": "Come by the fire, lay down your head\r\nMy love, I see you're growing tired\r\nSo set the bad day by the bed, and rest a while\r\nYour eyes can close\r\nYou don’t have to do a thing but listen to me sing\r\nI know you miss the world, the one you knew\n\nThe one where everything made sense\n\nBecause you didn't know the truth, that's how it works\n\nThe bottom drops out and we learn\n\nWe’re all just hunters seeking solid ground\n\n\n\nDon't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos\n\nThough I know it's blinding there's a way out\n\nSay out loud: we will not give up on love now\n\nNo fear, don't you turn like Orpheus, just stay here\n\nAnd hold me in the dark, and when the day appears\n\nWe'll say, we will not give up on love today\n\n\n\nI'll show you good, restore your faith\n\nI'll try and somehow make a meaning of the poison in this place\n\nConvince you love, don’t breathe it in\n\nYou were written in the stars that we are swimming in\n\nAnd it has no name, no guarantee\n\nIt’s just the promise of the day I know that some may never seek\n\nBut that's enough, if the bottom drops out\n\nI hope my love was someone else’s solid ground\n\n\n\nDon't stop trying to find me here amidst the chaos\n\nThough I know it's blinding there's a way out\n\nSay out loud: we will not give up on love now\n\nNo fear, don’t you turn like Orpheus, just stay here\n\nAnd hold me in the dark, and when the day appears\n\nWe'll say, we will not give up on love today\n\nWe'll say, we will not give up on love today"
