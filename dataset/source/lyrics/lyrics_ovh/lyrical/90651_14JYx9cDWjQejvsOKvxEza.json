  "lyrics": "He's reading sport on the news, white man white teeth in a suit\r\nHe's got that style\r\nAnd then alone in his house, he wants to take baby out\r\nGive us a smile\r\nBoy if you touch her again, I'll tell your wife and your kids\r\nAbout that time\n\nCos this is not ninety-three, you lost your spot on the team\n\nYou're out of line\n\n\n\nI've worked too hard for this chance to not be biting the hand\n\nThat feeds the hate\n\nSo have a chat to your friends 'cos it's our words that will keep\n\nOur daughters safe\n\nYour personality traits don't count if you put your dick\n\nIn someone's face\n\nAnd no it's never too late, we sat there silently while\n\nYou kept your job and your place and your six-figure wage\n\n\n\nOh, are you scared of me, old man?\n\nOr are you scared of what I'll do?\n\nYou grabbed me with an open hand\n\nThe world is grabbing back at you\n\n\n\nOh, are you scared of me, old man?\n\nOr are you scared of what I'll do?\n\nYou grabbed me with an open hand\n\nThe world is grabbing back at you\n\n\n\nOh, are you scared of me, old man?\n\nOr are you scared of what I'll do?\n\nYou grabbed me with an open hand\n\nThe world is grabbing back at you"
