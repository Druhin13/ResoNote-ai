  "lyrics": "In the back of the matinee, sitting on velvet\r\nTilt your head back when the trailers play, red light exit\r\nOh you’re breathing in when you’re ready\r\nOh you’re breathing dust slow and steady\r\nGoodbye baby it’s alright\n\nLos Angeles overnight\n\n\n\nWalking backwards down the canyon drive, feeling my red eyes\n\nPast the plant life on the shoulder side growing in street light\n\nOh I’m breathing in when I’m ready\n\nOh I’m breathing dust slow and steady\n\n\n\nGoodbye baby it’s alright\n\nLos Angeles overnight\n\n\n\nOh got lost in my mind\n\nOh I’m wasting my time\n\nI don’t think I would like it\n\n\n\nGoodbye baby it’s alright\n\nLos Angeles (leaving Los Angeles) overnight\n\nIt’s gonna be okay, you’re gonna be alright, time after time\n\nIf you wanna stay or if you wanna change, I won’t change your mind\n\nGoodbye baby it’s alright\n\nLos Angeles overnight"
