  "lyrics": "Staring out onto the earthly pottery of existence\r\nClimbing light vines to heaven\r\nClay ribbons descend\r\nSwirl downward against metallic swell\r\nGo sail charmer, altruist\r\nWho immersed in thickets\n\nHugged in cloth\n\nEvolves into charcoal\n\nIs worshipped by the drifting macaw\n\nThe lady finch\n\nThey swoop and croon through the air\n\nDip their feathers in the death paste of ash water\n\n\n\nI have wondered about the language of flowers\n\nAnd you, elaborate mosaic, greeting me\n\nGentle, the swamp takes my ankles\n\nOn and on we choke on an everlasting\n\nHandsome night\n\nMy lover's blood rushes right through me\n\nWild, fantastic"
