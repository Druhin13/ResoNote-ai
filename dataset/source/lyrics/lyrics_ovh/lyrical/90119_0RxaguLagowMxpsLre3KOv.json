  "lyrics": "I try to feel it inside but the fire that we had's all gone\r\nSometimes I think about why as the sand in the hourglass runs\r\nI try to keep it in line, maybe I'm just not the one\r\nBut you know I would\r\nBut you know I would\r\nBut you know I would keep it undercover\n\nWe could have each other\n\nBut you know I would\n\nBut you know I would only let you down\n\n\n\nYou know I'm gonna change\n\nThings just don't stay the same no more, no more\n\nYou know I'm gonna break\n\nYou know I'm gonna break your fading heart\n\nBut it's over, it's over, it's over now\n\n(I'm getting higher)\n\nBut it's over, it's over, it's over now\n\n(I'm getting higher)\n\n\n\nTime flies, the feeling inside strike a nerve and it all went numb\n\nWhy lie? You get me so high, my desire blocks out the sun\n\nI try to keep it in line, maybe I'm just not the one\n\nBut you know I would\n\nBut you know I would\n\nBut you know I would keep it undercover\n\nWe could have each other\n\nBut you know I would\n\nBut you know I would only let you down\n\n\n\nYou know I'm gonna change\n\nThings just don't stay the same no more, no more\n\nYou know I'm gonna break\n\nYou know I'm gonna break your fading heart\n\nBut it's over, it's over, it's over now\n\n(I'm getting higher)\n\nBut it's over, it's over, it's over now\n\n(I'm getting higher)\n\n\n\nYou don't know no better\n\nBut it's sadder that you need it\n\nYes, I keep my secrets to myself\n\nNobody knows how much I need them\n\nFirst off, you should know that my light's on but I ain't home\n\nUp high but I stay low\n\nFigure you ain't right when you ain't wrong\n\n'Cause I'm just glass, say it ain't so, say it ain't so\n\nYou know me, but you know\n\n\n\nYou know I'm gonna change\n\nThings just don't stay the same no more, no more\n\nYou know I'm gonna break\n\nYou know I'm gonna break your fading heart\n\nBut it's over, it's over, it's over now\n\n(I'm getting higher)\n\nBut it's over, it's over, it's over now\n\n(I'm getting higher)"
