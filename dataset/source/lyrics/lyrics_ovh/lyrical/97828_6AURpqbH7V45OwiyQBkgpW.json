  "lyrics": "Hope I'm not tired of rebuilding\r\nCause this might take a little more\r\nI think Iâ€™d like to try, look at you\r\nAnd feel the way I did before\r\nOh our fire died last winter\n\nAll of the shouting blew it out\n\nYou know I could live without or with you\n\nBut I might like having you about\n\n\n\nYes these new walls are pretty hard to crack\n\nAnd it might take a while until I trust you won't attack\n\nOh I apologize but it was only self-defence\n\nRunning away just made sense\n\n\n\nSo here I am with arms unfolding\n\nI guess it isn't quite the end\n\nOh partner in crime\n\nI am going to try\n\nTo fall in love with you again"
