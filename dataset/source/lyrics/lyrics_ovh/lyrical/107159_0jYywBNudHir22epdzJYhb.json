  "lyrics": "Dark as midnight and lost in it\r\nInsecure and just done with it\r\nLove gave up, so I stop believing\r\nThat I don't know how to get through feelings\r\nI thought it was the end of the world\n\nBut it kept spinning round, round, round\n\nAnd then the sun came up again\n\nAnd I stopped looking down, down, down\n\nI thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes had lost their shine\n\nBut just like a lifeline right on time\n\nI met you at the end of the world\n\n\n\nThe sky kept falling, but we danced in it\n\nI was done with love, but second chance did it\n\nYou cleared the smoke and picked up the wreckage\n\nGot to go through hell to get to heaven\n\n\n\nI thought it was the end of the world\n\nBut it kept spinning round, round, round\n\nAnd then the sun came up again\n\nAnd I stopped looking down, down, down\n\nI thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes had lost their shine\n\nBut just like a lifeline right on time\n\nI met you at the end of the world, the world, the world\n\n\n\nI thought the cold would last forever\n\nI didn't know that there was something better\n\nWaiting at the end of the world, the world, the world\n\n\n\nI thought it was the end of the world\n\nBut it kept spinning round, round, round\n\nAnd then the sun came up again\n\nAnd I stopped looking down, down, down\n\nI thought the stars in the sky and in my eyes had lost their shine\n\nBut just like a lifeline right on time\n\nI met you at the end of the world, the world, the world\n\n\n\nI thought it was the end of the world\n\nI thought it was\n\nDark as midnight and lost in it\n\nThe sky kept falling, but we danced in it"
