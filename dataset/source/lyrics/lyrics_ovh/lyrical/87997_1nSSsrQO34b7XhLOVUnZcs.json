  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Slow Burn par Danielle Bradbery\r\nBorn in a hurry, always late\nHaven't been early since '88\nTexas is hot I can be cold\nGrandma cried when I pierced my nose\nGood in a glass, good on green\nGood when you're puttin' your hands all over me\n\nI'm alright with a slow burn\nTakin' my time, let the world turn\nI'm gonna do it my way, if II be alright\nIf we bum it down and it takes all night\nIt's a slow bum, yeah\n\nIn Tennessee, the sun's goin' down\nBut in Beijing, they're headin' out to work\nYou know the bar down the street don't close for an hour\n\nWe should take a walk and look at all the flowers\n\n'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn\nTakin' my time, let the world turn\nI'm gonna do it my way, if II be alright\nIf we bum it down and it takes all night\nIt's a slow burn\n\nWhatever feels good\nOld soul, waitin' my turn\nI know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn\nSo I'm alright with a slow bum, slow bum, slow burn\nI'm alright with a slow burn"
