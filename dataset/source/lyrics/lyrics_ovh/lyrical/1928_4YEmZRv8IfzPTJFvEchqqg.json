  "lyrics": "Billy the bum lived by the thumb\r\nAnd sang of the hobo's delight\r\nHe'd prove he could run\r\nTwice as fast as the sun\r\nBy losing his shadow at night\r\nNow he loved every girl\n\nIn this curly headed world\n\nBut no one will know it seems\n\nFor two twisted legs and a childhood disease\n\nLeft Billy just a bum in his dreams\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd he was just a gentle boy\n\nA real florescent light\n\nCried pennies on Sunday morning\n\nLaughs nickels on Saturday night\n\nAnd your bullets they can't harm him\n\nNor your knives tear him apart\n\nHumiliation killed him\n\nGod bless his little heart\n\n\n\nNow he lived all alone\n\nIn a run down home\n\nNear the side of the old railroad track\n\nWhere the trains used to run\n\nCarrying freight by the ton\n\nAnd blow the whistle as Billy'd wave back\n\nBut the children around Billy's home town\n\nSeemed to have nothin' better to do\n\nThen run around his house\n\nWith their tongues from their mouth\n\nAnd make fun of that crippled old fool\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)\n\n\n\nNow some folks they wait\n\nAnd some folks they pray\n\nFor Jesus to rise up again\n\nBut none of these folks\n\nIn their holy cloaks\n\nEver took Billy on as a friend\n\nFor pity's a crime\n\nAnd it ain't worth a dime\n\nTo a person who's really in need\n\nJust treat 'em the same\n\nAs you would your own name\n\nNext time that your heart starts to bleed\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)"
