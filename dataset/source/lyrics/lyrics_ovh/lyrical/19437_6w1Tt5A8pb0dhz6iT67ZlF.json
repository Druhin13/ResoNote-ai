Motherfucker just watch\n\nI spit megawatts to black out a thousand city blocks\n\nFuck Glocks got a Springfield armory accurate as medieval archery\n\nThat'll drain the plasma from your arteries\n\nYou're part of me, I'm partly retarded, a martyr\n\nTaggin' cop cars with a fat marker, nobody harder\n\nI'm Megalosaurus armor, I'm quicker than Peter Parker\n\nPut crop circles in fields then I'm fuckin' the farmers daughter\n\nI travel through vortexical portals made out of water\n\nI slaughter the competition with spittin', why would you bother?\n\nThe author of holy scripture but I'm not the Holy Father\n\nGhostwriter like Shakespeare If you makin' the right offer\n\nThem other rappers are softer, get buried with Jimmy Hoffa\n\nGet off of me this is awfully obvious y'all are jockin' me\n\nUsing quotes from verses like reverse psychology\n\nRap isn't gettin' better, y'all just used to poorer quality\n\nAnd I don't give a fuck if you tell me you never felt me\n\n'Cause you probably just jelly your favorite rapper couldn't melt me\n\nI probably shot some babies in your baby mama's belly\n\nAnd her telly, watchin' Belly, wouldn't beat it 'cause she smelly\n\nNo name rappers who sweat themselves really isn't healthy\n\nDoesn't make sense like a paparazzi takin' a selfie\n\nLet it marinade on some ice\n\nI'm Kevin >Otto??< on the mic narratin' my life\n\n\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nEvery word, every line, every rhyme is control of the mind\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nEvery day, every night, every verse I write by candle light\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nFull moons overhead, words glow on the page that I read\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nIn the deepness of the woods, in a circle with a torch wearin' hoods\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nEvery word, every line, every rhyme is control of the mind\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nEvery day, every night, every verse I write by candle light\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nFull moons overhead, words glow on the page that I read\n\nI put a spell on you\n\nIn the deepness of the woods, in a circle with a torch wearin' hoods\n\nI put a spell on you\n\n\n\nEvery religious, mystical, and philosophical sect has had exactly the same difficulty from the beginning of time. Where it is the person... who really believes that the esoteric truths of life are some kind of a secret. And that it is possible to find the key. Buy it, steal it, beg it, borrow it, through some way to get it. And that by means of this key we can suddenly unlock the shut door of the powers of the King"
