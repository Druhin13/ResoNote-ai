  "lyrics": "She wrote down this line on the barren wall\r\nTo not forget her trail of dreams\r\nBut through the haze of her fevered pain\r\nHer thoughts were hard to understand\r\nBorn without the name on the darkest day\n\nHer future was already written\n\nAs fantasies turned to poems on the stone\n\nThe world began to come alive\n\n\n\nShe made me smile \n\nThough years passed by\n\n\n\nCome day, come night, my crimson bride\n\nIs dancing on the fields of gold\n\nThis scenery will never fail\n\nIn my dreaming mind\n\nDreaming mind\n\n\n\nAll through these days\n\nI have held your hand\n\nWe never left the velvet cage\n\nVespertine, our memories relive\n\nMy irresistible demise\n\n\n\nShe made me smile \n\nThough years passed by\n\n\n\nCome day, come night, my crimson bride\n\nIs dancing on the fields of gold\n\nThis scenery will never fail\n\nIn my dreaming mind\n\nDreaming mind\n\n\n\nVague are the images around me\n\nCold is the color of the night\n\n\n\nCome day, come night, my crimson bride\n\nIs dancing on the fields of gold\n\nThis scenery will never fail\n\nIn my dreaming mind\n\nDreaming mind"
