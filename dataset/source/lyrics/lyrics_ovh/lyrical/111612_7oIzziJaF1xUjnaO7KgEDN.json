But I ain't finished growing\n\nAnother night the inevitable prolongs\n\nAnother day another dawn\n\nJust tell Keisha and Taneisha I'll be back in the morn'\n\nAnother lie that I carry on\n\nI need to get back to the place I belong\n\n\n\nI'm coming home\n\nI'm coming home\n\nTell the world that I'm coming home\n\nLet the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes\n\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\n\nTell the world that I'm coming, home\n\n\n\n\"A House is Not A Home\", I hate this song\n\nIs a house really a home when your loved ones are gone (no)\n\nAnd niggas got the nerve to blame you for it\n\nAnd you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it\n\nBut you felt it and still feel it\n\nAnd money can't make up for it or conceal it\n\nBut you deal with it and you keep ballin'\n\nPour out some liquor, play ball and we keep ballin'\n\nBaby we've been living in sin 'cause we've been really in love\n\nBut we've been living as friends\n\nSo you've been a guest in your own home\n\nIt's time to make your house your own\n\nPick up your phone, come on\n\n\n\nI'm coming home\n\nI'm coming home\n\nTell the world that I'm coming home\n\nLet the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes\n\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\n\nTell the world that I'm coming, home\n\n\n\n\"Ain't No Stopping Us Now\", I love that song\n\nWhenever it comes on it makes me feel strong\n\nI thought I told y'all that we won't stop\n\n'Til we back cruising through Harlem, these old blocks\n\nIs what made me, saved me, drove me crazy\n\nDrove me away than embraced me\n\nForgave me for all of my shortcomings\n\nWelcome to my homecoming\n\nYeah it's been a long time coming\n\nLot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles\n\nLot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs\n\nMade it back, lost my dog (I miss you big)\n\nAnd here I stand, a better man! (a better man)\n\nThank you Lord (Thank you Lord)\n\nThank you all!\n\n\n\nI'm coming home\n\nI'm coming home\n\nTell the world that I'm coming home\n\nLet the rain wash away all the pain from yesterday\n\nI know my kingdom awaits and they've forgiven my mistakes\n\nI'm coming home, I'm coming home\n\nTell the world that I'm coming, home"
