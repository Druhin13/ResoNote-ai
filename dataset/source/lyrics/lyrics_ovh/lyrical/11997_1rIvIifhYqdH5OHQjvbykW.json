  "lyrics": "Some things you can't go back to\r\nSome things need left alone\r\nDon't mess with the memories of a life passed on\r\nAll the time I made reservations, at the heart of my mistakes\r\nOh, some things you can't go back to\r\nCause you left them slip away\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a witness\n\nTo a path that's overgrown\n\nI don't wanna see this house not be a home\n\nCause has taken control of, what we couldn't see\n\nNo I don't wanna be a witness\n\nTo the end of you and me\n\n\n\nHow am I gonna make each moment,\n\nBetter than the last\n\nHow am I gonna make it better\n\nIf I can't go back\n\n\n\nAll the time I made reservations, at the heart of my mistakes\n\nOh, some things you can't go back to\n\nCause you left them slip away\n\nOh, some things you can't go back to."
