Thank you?\r\nLike here we go again...\r\nI'm back, gotta put my city on the map\r\nHad to get my bro out the trap\r\nShows getting packed like here we go again\n\nLet's ride, everybody want a hundred

flame as it gets\n\nWhen we talking about greats put my name in the mix\n\nFeed me a beat Imma mangle the shit\n\nInsides blue like I strangled the whip\n\nDo anything for a shirt and a pic\n\nF.O.D. know you heard of the clique\n\nWe're all authentic every word is legit\n\nSee you going fast but you swerving and shit\n\nNiggas peewee league better learn how to hit\n\nSelf made nigga yeah I earned every bit (quit)\n\nCan you stop with the pop shots?\n\nGot guap in our socks now we top notch\n\nI get this bitch jumping like hopscotch\n\nTaking anybody here for the top spot\n\nNigga you don't

growing it's time to harvest\n\nSmarter with the talking you think that I went to Harvard\n\nCoffins I'm filling em, feeling like I need Ritalin\n\nDrilling em off adrenaline, someone gonna need to reel em in\n\nRiddle written with synonyms, venomous as Futuristic is iller then competition\n\nI'm in it to get the benjamins\n\nGive it to all my niggas and take a trip with all my women\n\nGenuine since the beginning, vision is what I'm living in\n\nWoah that boy cold Imma pass it to my nigga like...\n\n\n\nNow here we go again\n\nI'm back, gotta put my city on the map\n\nHad to get my bro out the trap\n\nShows getting packed like here we go again\n\nLet's ride, everybody want a hundred on the side\n\nNiggas know I die for my squad, eye for an eye\n\nHere we go again\n\nHere we go again\n\n\n\nI been this way for so long\n\nI swear to God I ain't changing\n\nI'm just thanking God that we made it\n\nDon't come up short on my payments\n\nThat's dangerous, I'm living life that can't tame me\n\nNo favours, no favours\n\nLike here we go again\n\n\n\nNiggas sale papers just to put dick in a slut\n\nTerminater guns should of lift up a truck\n\nSquares in a circle can't kick it with us\n\nWe in this bitch got it lit like cigarette butts\n\nUnorthodox can't put me in a box\n\nA-town nigga till they put me in a box\n\nI'm flexing on em tell em put me in the drop\n\nMy diamonds two step bank account milly rock\n\nTrap niggas at the Met Galla\n\nMac-11 watch the head splatter\n\nPut em in the ocean with the red snappers\n\nGuillotine Benton I behead rappers\n\nHopping out the foreign like [?]\n\nGangster bitch serving niggas soccer\n\nHating as nigga get a hobby\n\nGang of bad bitches give me sloppy\n\nPopping tags threw a tag at a body\n\nFrench to death toe tag on my body\n\nKamikaze hitman Luca Brasi\n\nBullet holes in your mans new Ferarri\n\nMy side bitch let me fuck and her friends\n\nIf you ain't fam nigga then it's fuck you and your friends\n\nGod in this bitch the whole city going in\n\nGot the motherfucker jumping like...\n\n\n\nNow here we go again\n\nI'm back, gotta put my city on the map\n\nHad to get my bro out the trap\n\nShows getting packed
