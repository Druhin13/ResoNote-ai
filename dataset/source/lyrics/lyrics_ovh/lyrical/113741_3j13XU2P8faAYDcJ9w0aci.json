  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson All Night par Steve Aoki\r\n[Lauren Jauregui]\nMy heart beats a little faster\nWhen our eyes meet in the middle of a crowded room\nIn knee deep testing waters\nI've got a feeling, and I don't know what to do, you\n\n[Lauren Jauregui]\nYou got me paralyzed, and I think I like it\nCaught me by surprise, I'm not usually like this, no\nGot me paralyzed, don't think I can help it\nWhy's it feel so right?\n\n[Lauren Jauregui]\n\nLet's keep this going all night\nGoing all night\nGoing all night\nGoing all night\n\n[Lauren Jauregui]\nThe crowd fades, tunnel vision\nIn a daze, and the only thing I feel is you\nIn perfect syncopation\nFace to face, tell me do you feel it too? You\n\n[Lauren Jauregui]\nYou got me paralyzed, and I think I like it\nCaught me by surprise, I'm not usually like this, no\nGot me paralyzed, don't think I can fight this\nWhy's it feel so right?\n\n\n[Lauren Jauregui]\nLet's keep this going all night\nGoing all night\nGoing all night\nGoing all night\n\n[ Lauren Jauregui]\nBut maybe I should wait\nLet it fall into place\n'Cause I keep going over\nThe things that could come from me feeling this way\nAnd I don't wanna play (I don't wanna play)\nThis emotional game (this emotional game)\nBut when you pull me closer\nI cannot deny that I want you to stay\n\n[Post-Bridge: Lauren Jauregui]\n\nWoah, yeah\nYou got me\nYou got me, got me paralyzed (woah)\n\n[Lauren Jauregui]\nGot me paralyzed (got me paralyzed), and I think I like it (like it)\nCaught me by surprise, I'm not usually like this, no\nGot me paralyzed (yeah), don't think I can fight this (woah)\nWhy's it feel so right?\nLet's keep this going all night"
