It's dismissive, I don't understand this person so he's crazy. That's bullshit, these people are not crazy, they're strong people. Maybe their environment is a little sick.\"\n\n\n\nDave Chapelle: \"Black people don't know a god damn thing about therapy.\"\n\n\n\nSelf: Capital Steez, Tyheim, Chester Bennington\n\nRest in peace my strong friends"
