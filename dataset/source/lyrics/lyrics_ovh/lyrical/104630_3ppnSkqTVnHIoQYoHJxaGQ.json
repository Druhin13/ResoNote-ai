  "lyrics": "If you leave your faith in time, then it's over for you\r\nYour escape right now is the space of another\r\nBecause the truth is way too much for you to handle\r\nYeah, haven't you enough love for yourself?\r\nWhy we keep running? Somebody tell me\n\nHiding from something, under your shelter\n\n\n\nBut if you look in the mirror long enough to see yourself\n\nIf you look in the mirror long enough to free yourself\n\nYou would notice that you're alone waking up\n\nIf you look in the mirror, mirror, you remember yourself, yourself\n\n\n\nGotta keep your eyes wide open the same way they do\n\nTo believe in things you don't understand ain't good for you\n\nThey think the truth is way too much for you to handle\n\nYeah, show 'em you got much love for yourself (Yeah)\n\n\n\nWhy we keep running? Somebody tell me\n\nHiding from something, under your shelter (Ooh)\n\n\n\nBut if you look in the mirror long enough to see yourself\n\nIf you look in the mirror long enough to free yourself\n\nYou would notice that you're alone waking up\n\nIf you look in the mirror, mirror, you remember yourself, yourself\n\n\n\nAnd this won't be your last\n\nBut you're always there\n\nSearching for yourself\n\nDeeper and deeper\n\nYou just don't remember\n\nAnd that's alright\n\nBut if you just happen\n\nTo look\n\n\n\nBut if you look in the mirror long enough to see yourself\n\nIf you look in the mirror long enough to free yourself\n\nYou would notice that you're alone waking up\n\nIf you look in the mirror, mirror, you remember yourself, yourself"
