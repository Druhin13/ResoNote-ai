  "lyrics": "I never ever find my way around the roads I walked on\r\nAnd every single day the ground is crawling underneath\r\nAnd I can never be the one to say I got this all wrong\r\nIn every single way I think I'm falling inbetween\r\nBut I wanna be brave, and I wanna feel changed\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\nAnd I wanna hear waves, and I wanna hear break\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\n\n\nTake me to the place in angel city that we long for\n\nJust a cup of coffee and a conversation too\n\nYou said that everything that happens always passes, moves on\n\nI said that I would do it all again, it's all for you\n\n\n\nBut I wanna be brave, and I wanna feel changed\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\nAnd I wanna hear waves, and I wanna hear break\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\n\n\nAll the worry, all the doubt\n\nAll the things that keep you down\n\nI have a reason to believe\n\nEverything is gonna be fine yeah, yeah\n\nBreathe it in and breathe it out\n\nKnow the air will clean you out\n\nNow or never here and now\n\nLet's make today the turnaround\n\n\n\nYou said that everything that happens always passes, moves on\n\nI said that I would do it all again, it's all for you\n\n\n\nBut I wanna be brave, and I wanna feel changed\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\nAnd I wanna hear waves, and I wanna hear break\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\nAnd I wanna hear waves, and I wanna hear break\n\nAnd I wanna say, \"let's make today the turnaround\"\n\nLet's make today the turnaround"
