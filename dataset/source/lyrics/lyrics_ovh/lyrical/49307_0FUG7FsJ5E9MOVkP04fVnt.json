  "lyrics": "I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm\r\nI'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string\r\nI'd say that I had spring fever\r\nBut I know it isn't spring\r\nI am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented\n\nLike a nightingale without a song to sing\n\nOh, why should I have Spring fever\n\nWhen it isn't even spring?\n\n\n\nI keep wishing I were somewhere else\n\nWalking down a strange new street\n\nHearing words that I have never heard\n\nFrom a girl I've yet to meet\n\n\n\nI'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams\n\nI'm as giddy as a baby on a swing\n\nI haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing\n\nBut I feel so gay in a melancholy way\n\nThat it might as well be spring\n\n\n\nIt might as well be spring"
