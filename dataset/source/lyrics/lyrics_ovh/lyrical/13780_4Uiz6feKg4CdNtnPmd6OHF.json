  "lyrics": "You roll through life like a roaring fire\r\nI bring the rain like a thunderstorm\r\nYeah, we found peace on a battlefield\r\nIt all makes sense in love and war\r\nIt all makes sense in love and war\r\nYou and me, wild as a willow in a hurricane\n\nStrong enough to stand in the stormy weather\n\nWe might be crazy enough to make history\n\n'Cause the world just ain't the same since we got together\n\nAnd if we don't die young we might just live forever\n\nThere are kings and queens up on their thrones\n\nThat have a love like you and me\n\nKingdoms rise and kingdoms fall, but love has lasted eternally\n\nLove has last eternally\n\nYou and me, wild as a willow in a hurricane\n\nStrong enough to stand in the stormy weather\n\nWe might be crazy enough to make history\n\n'Cause the world just ain't the same since we got together\n\nAnd if we don't die young we might just live forever\n\nThey might sing us in a song\n\nOr write our names up in the sky\n\nEven when it's carved in stone\n\nA love like ours goes on and on\n\nA love like ours goes on and on\n\nYou and me, wild as a willow in a hurricane\n\nStrong enough to stand in the stormy weather\n\nWe might be crazy enough to make history\n\n'Cause the world just ain't the same since we got together\n\nAnd if we don't die young we might just live forever\n\nYou roll through life like a roaring fire\n\nI bring the rain liek a thunderstorm"
