  "lyrics": "When pretending lends a helping hand\r\nWe hold it close, so close, and never let it go\r\nThen, the pen begins to write a story\r\nWith an end that bends right out of our control\r\nHow did we get so jaded? I don't know\n\nWas it the white lies feeding our egos?\n\nI never valuated minutes I burned through\n\nIs that just how it goes?\n\nSeconds I wasted, I was fixated\n\nYou're devastated, sorry to say\n\nI can't fix it, is this where I give in?\n\n\n\nI'm falling through the hourglass\n\nAnd I don't think I'll ever make it back\n\nSo I throw stones at walls I'll never climb\n\nVictim to the sands of time\n\nFalling through the hourglass\n\nThe hourglass\n\n\n\nTime is strange, it's ever-flowing\n\nNever going back, it moves, but only in one way\n\nTurn the page, look back at what you wrote\n\nDo you still feel the same?\n\nI'll bet your mind has changed\n\n\n\nHow did it get so scary? I don't know\n\nWas it the hard life starving our egos\n\nI never valued minutes I burned through\n\nIs that just how it goes?\n\nSeconds I wasted, I was fixated\n\nYou're devastated, sorry to say\n\nI can't fix it, is this where I give in?\n\n(Let's go!)\n\n\n\nI'm falling through the hourglass\n\nAnd I don't think I'll ever make it back\n\nSo I throw stones at walls I'll never climb\n\nVictim to the sands of time\n\nFalling through the hourglass\n\nThe hourglass\n\n(The hourglass)\n\n\n\n'Cause that's just how it goes\n\n'Cause that's just how it goes\n\n'Cause that's just how it goes\n\n\n\nFalling through the hourglass\n\nAnd I don't think I'll ever make it back\n\nSo I throw stones at walls I'll never climb\n\nVictim to the sands of time\n\nFalling through the hourglass\n\n(Through the hourglass)\n\n\n\nI'm falling through the hourglass (I'm falling through the hourglass)\n\nAnd I don't think I'll ever make it back (Make it back)\n\nSo I throw stones at walls I'll never climb\n\nVictim to the sands of time\n\nFalling through the hourglass\n\nThe hourglass"
