  "lyrics": "Rose girls in glass vases\r\nPerfect bodies, perfect faces\r\nThey all belong in magazines\r\nThose girls the boys are chasing\r\nWinning all the games they're playing\r\nThey're always in a different league\n\n\n\nStretching toward the sky like I don't care\n\nWishing you could see me standing there\n\n\n\nBut I'm a sunflower, a little funny\n\nIf I were a rose, maybe you'd want me\n\nIf I could, I'd change overnight\n\nAnd turn into something you'd like\n\nBut I'm a sunflower, a little funny\n\nIf I were a rose, maybe you'd pick me\n\nBut I know you don't have a clue\n\nThis sunflower's waiting for you\n\nWaiting for you\n\nBut I'm a sunflower, a little funny\n\nAnd if I were her, maybe you'd pick me\n\nBut I know you don't have a clue\n\nThis sunflower's waiting for you\n\nWaiting for you"
