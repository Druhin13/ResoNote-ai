  "lyrics": "Remember when hell had frozen over?\r\nThe cold still burns underneath my skin\r\nThe water is rising all around me\r\nAnd there is nothing left I can give\r\nAll these tears I've shed\n\nI saw the wildfire spread\n\nYou said you cheated death\n\nBut heaven was in my head\n\n\n\nThey say the good die young\n\nNo use in saying what is done is done\n\n'Cause it's not enough\n\nAnd when the night gives way\n\nIt's like a brand new doomsday\n\nWhat will be will be\n\nEvery river flows into the sea\n\nBut it's never enough\n\nAnd when the night gives way\n\nIt's like like a brand new doomsday\n\nNo matter what they say\n\nIt's like a brand new doomsday\n\n\n\nThe embers still glow when I'm sober\n\nThe gold in the flame burns brighter now\n\nI have to rebuild, now it's over\n\nMaybe now I'm lost I can live\n\n\n\nSouls don't break, they bend\n\nBut I sometimes forget\n\nI have to do this for you\n\nAnd the only way out is through\n\n\n\nDeath is an open door\n\n\n\nWords the prophets said\n\nStill swimming through my head\n\nNow there's no stars left in the sky\n\n'Cause this well will never run dry\n\nWhat if I completely forget?\n\nWhat if I never accept?\n\n'Cause when you fade away\n\nIt's like a brand new doomsday\n\n\n\nThey say the good die young\n\nNo use in saying what is done is done\n\n'Cause it's not enough\n\nAnd when the night gives way\n\nIt's like a brand new doomsday\n\nWhat will be will be\n\nEvery river flows into the sea\n\nBut it's never enough\n\nAnd when the night gives way\n\nIt's like a brand new doomsday\n\nNo matter what they say\n\nIt's like a brand new doomsday"
