  "lyrics": "Are you lonesome tonight,\r\ndo you miss me tonight?\r\nAre you sorry we drifted apart?\r\nDoes your memory stray to a brighter sunny day\r\nWhen I kissed you and called you sweetheart?\r\nDo the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?\n\nDo you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?\n\nIs your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?\n\nTell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?\n\n\n\nI wonder if you're lonesome tonight\n\nYou know someone said that the world's a stage\n\nAnd each must play a part.\n\nFate had me playing in love with you as my sweet heart.\n\nAct one was when we met, I loved you at first glance\n\nYou read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue\n\nThen came act two, you seemed to change and you acted strange\n\nAnd why I'll never know.\n\nHoney, you lied when you said you loved me\n\nAnd I had no cause to doubt you.\n\nBut I'd rather go on hearing your lies\n\nThan go on living without you.\n\nNow the stage is bare and I'm standing there\n\nWith emptiness all around\n\nAnd if you won't come back to me\n\nThen they can bring the curtain down.\n\n\n\nIs your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?\n\nTell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"
