  "lyrics": "Lately, I've been noticing a change in your walking\r\nMy baby, all the time you'll be demanded to smile\r\nTo fill our their pride\r\nI wanna show you the colors they hide\r\nI wanna prove that the cat doesn't have to be black\r\nI wanna show you the jokes that they usually use\n\nAgainst you in the nights\n\nThey're on drugs\n\n\n\nNo, I'm friendly saying no\n\nLast night was wrong, I know\n\nYou don't need a lover\n\nBut I don't want\n\nI don't wanna go\n\n\n\nHoney, don't pretend that you're not changing your talking\n\nPolitely, can I ask you what the hell do they have\n\nThat you want so bad?\n\nI wanna show you it's cool to grow up\n\nI wanna prove that your clock doesn't stop at the club\n\nI wanna show you the value that you can't help losing, amusing them, you're not that kind\n\n\n\nNo, I'm friendly saying no\n\nLast night was wrong, I know\n\nYou don't need a lover\n\nBut I don't want\n\nI don't wanna go\n\n\n\nI'm friendly saying no\n\nLast night was wrong, I know\n\nThat you don't need a lover\n\nBut I'm not gonna go"
