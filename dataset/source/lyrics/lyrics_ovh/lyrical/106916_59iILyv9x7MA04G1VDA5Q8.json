  "lyrics": "The right words\r\nSometimes they won't be heard\r\nSometimes my mouth's absurd and wrong\r\nYes I know\r\nSometimes I sink so low\r\nSometimes I shout to show I'm strong\n\n\n\nBut you've been singin' to me, singin' to me all along\n\nSingin' to me, singin' to me all along\n\nYou kept on singin' when everything went wrong\n\n\n\nThe road noise drowns out my old joys\n\nSometimes your golden voice gets lost\n\nBut if I listen, I hear what I'm missin'\n\nThe chorus is kissin' back the frost\n\n\n\nYou've been singin' to me, singin' to me all along\n\nSingin' to me, singin' to me all along\n\nYou kept on singin' when everything went wrong\n\n\n\nI lost my bearings\n\nMy blank eyes were staring\n\nScared to try caring for someone\n\nI wasn't trying\n\nMy tongue took to lying\n\nShying away from your song\n\n\n\nYou've been singin' to me, singin' to me all along\n\nSingin' to me, singin' to me all along\n\nYou kept on singin' when everything went wrong\n\n\n\nI still don't know what took me so long"
