  "lyrics": "Hold on to that dream\r\nTomorrow knows, where and when\r\nIt's true, what you believe\r\nDon't let go, the road will never end\r\nThe sunset melts into the deep blue sea\n\nIt turns a crimson shade (a wonderful free-fall)\n\nI just want to have the wind\n\nTake me far away (Take me far away)\n\n\n\nI've cleared impossible hurtles before\n\nBut I know that there's more\n\nAnd I know I can make it\n\nWho's to blame when it's not the best\n\nThat I can achieve\n\n\n\nHold on to that dream\n\nTomorrow knows, where and when\n\nIt's true, what you believe\n\nDon't let go, the road will never end\n\n\n\nKeep trying to believe\n\nThe biggest part of you\n\nAnd now your ready to go\n\n\n\nHow much longer do I have to cry\n\nBefore tomorrows light? (A night full of sorrow)\n\nAll at once I found today\n\nI finally hit my limit (Hit my limit)\n\n\n\nI'm sure that when you are falling in love\n\nIt's just like blinking your eye\n\nBefore you know it, it flies away\n\nI just want to know how strong I can be\n\nWhen I'm searching for love\n\n\n\nHold on to that dream\n\nTomorrow knows, where and when\n\nMy lips, tightly sealed\n\nBut you can still, see it in my eyes\n\nI've traveled down that road and found the greater love\n\nThis time I know it is real\n\n\n\nI've cleared impossible hurtles before\n\n\n\nBut I know that there's more\n\nAnd I know I can make it\n\nBut when I got up to the starting line\n\nMy legs were frozen with fear\n\n\n\nHold on to that dream\n\nTomorrow knows, where and when\n\nReach out, with both your arms\n\nAnd take the key, that opens up your heart\n\n\n\nHold on to the dream\n\nTomorrow knows, where and when\n\nIt's true, what you believe\n\nDon't let go, the road will never end\n\n\n\nKeep trying to believe\n\nThe biggest part of you\n\nAnd now your ready to go"
