You've had the time to\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't, play both)\n\nMust I remind you, you've had the time to\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't play both, can't play both, can't play both)\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't play both, can't play both, can't play both)\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n\n\nDon't be switching sides on me (on me)\n\nStop making time for me (for me)\n\nPut loving to the side for me (yeah, yeah)\n\nShould I ball? You can't decide for me\n\nTryna be your love and a homie (yeah, yeah)\n\nTelling all your friends I left you lonely (yeah)\n\nSay you single, text me when you want it\n\nBut you got decisions to make\n\n\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't play both)\n\nWho are you lying to? You've had the time to\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't, play both)\n\nMust I remind you, you've had the time to\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't play both, can't play both, can't play both)\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n(Can't play both, can't play both, can't play both)\n\nMust I remind you, you've had the time to\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\n\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides\n\nMust I remind you, you've had the time to\n\nMake up your mind you can't play both sides"
