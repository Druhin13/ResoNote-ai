  "lyrics": "My last made me feel like I would never try again\r\nBut when I saw you, I felt something I never felt\r\nCome closer, I'll give you all my love\r\nIf you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything\r\nMy last made me feel like I would never try again\r\nBut when I saw you, I felt something I never felt\n\nCome closer, I'll give you all my love\n\nIf you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything\n\n\n\nTalk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya\n\nFall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love\n\nBefore you, baby, I was numb, drown the pain by pouring up\n\nSpeeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up\n\nNow you the one that I'm calling\n\nSwore that I'd never forget, don't think I'm just talking\n\nI think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya\n\n\n\nFeeling like I'm out of my mind, cause I can't get enough\n\nOnly one that I give my time, 'cause I got time for ya\n\nMight make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feeling ya\n\nThink I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one\n\n\n\nMy last made me feel like I would never try again\n\nBut when I saw you, I felt something I never felt\n\nCome closer, I'll give you all my love\n\nIf you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything\n\nMy last made me feel like I would never try again\n\nBut when I saw you, I felt something I never felt\n\nCome closer, I'll give you all my love\n\nIf you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything\n\n\n\nI'll never give my all again\n\n'Cause I'm sick of falling down\n\nWhen I open up and give my trust\n\nThey find a way to break it down\n\nTear me up inside, and you break me down"
