  "lyrics": "It’s time I should be leaving, it’s time for me to go\r\nBanging on my ceiling and your footprints in the snow\r\nThey climb Christmas morning beneath the tree and the front yard\r\nSound screams the morning every scentsy derby cars\r\nHide your gun on acid washed\n\nBrain a shame, a total loss\n\nThey said that they did all they could\n\nThat boys been dead since childhood\n\nLeave me alone to analyze\n\nSaw our power after pride\n\nTicker out of time and whack\n\nTo be young and die of heart attack\n\n\n\nI guess I should be going, there’s nothing I can say\n\nTo ease your dad from throwing up at least 3 times a day\n\nThe fun Christmas morning beneath the tree and the back yard\n\nThe calming of your mother’s quips while losing you in a car\n\n\n\nHide your gun on acid washed\n\nBrain a shame, a total loss\n\nThey said that they did all they could\n\nThat boys been dead since childhood\n\nLeave me alone to analyze\n\nSaw our power after pride\n\nTicker out of time and whack\n\nTo be young and die of heart attack\n\n\n\nI can fall a tree\n\nNext thing you have to learn\n\nCaskets and carriage, I’m not to blame\n\nTo bring a new dead babe right back\n\nYou dead and buried\n\n\n\nHide your gun on acid washed\n\nBrain a shame, a total loss\n\nThey said that they did all they could\n\nThat boys been dead since childhood\n\nLeave me alone to analyze\n\nSaw our power after pride\n\nTicker out of time and whack\n\nTo be young and die of heart attack"
