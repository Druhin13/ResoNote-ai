  "lyrics": "I was in Pittsburgh when I saw Superman in the backroom\r\nHe was doing lines or something in the bathroom\r\nI barely recognized him at all\r\nI saw him doing things you shouldn't do with all that power\r\nI wish someone would have thrown him in the shower\r\nI barely recognized him at all\n\n\n\nThat night I put my youth in a casket\n\nAnd buried it inside of me\n\nThat night I saw through all the magic\n\nNow I'm a witness to the death of a hero\n\nI burned all the pictures in the attic\n\nAnd threw away the magazines\n\nThat night I saw through all the magic\n\nAnd now I'm a witness to the death of a hero\n\n\n\nI tried to look away but you can't look away from a trainwreck\n\nThe things you said to girls, well they were shameless\n\nI barely recognized him at all\n\nI tried to help but he said he was just too far from saving\n\nAnd nothing I could say was gonna change him\n\nI barely recognized him at all\n\n\n\nThat night I put my youth in a casket\n\nAnd buried it inside of me\n\nThat night I saw through all the magic\n\nNow I'm a witness to the death of a hero\n\nI burned all the pictures in the attic\n\nAnd threw away the magazines\n\nThat night I saw through all the magic\n\nAnd now I'm a witness to the death of a hero\n\n\n\nThe death of a hero he couldn't be saved\n\nNow I'm cutting the grass and I'll cover his grave\n\nI'll cover his grave\n\nThe death of a hero I'm turning the page\n\nNow I'm cutting the grass and I'll cover his grave\n\nI'll cover his grave\n\n\n\nThat night I put my youth in a casket\n\nAnd buried in inside of me\n\nThat night I saw through all the magic\n\nNow I'm a witness to the death of a hero\n\nI burned all the pictures in the attic\n\nAnd threw away the magazines\n\nThat night I saw through all the magic\n\nAnd now I'm a witness to the death of a hero"
