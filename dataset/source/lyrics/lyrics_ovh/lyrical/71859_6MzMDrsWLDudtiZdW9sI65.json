How did that feel?\n\nWhere are we now? 'Cause that's what's real, yeah\n\nAll the space and the time between us\n\nMan, you should have seen us\n\nThis ain't no mystery\n\nOur future is our history\n\n\n\nI feel alive\n\nAnd can we try\n\nTo leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same\n\nAnd here we are\n\nWe've come so far\n\nLet's leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same\n\n\n\nWhat comes next\n\nWe don't know, we're not there yet\n\nBut I bet it's gonna shine better than all we left behind\n\nIn a room in a blink and now it's\n\nLike we never went a day without it\n\nPick it back up where we left off\n\nThis is liftoff\n\n\n\nI feel alive\n\nAnd can we try\n\nTo leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same\n\nAnd here we are\n\nWe've come so far\n\nLet's leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same\n\n\n\nOoh ooh, watch it spin\n\nAnd ooh ooh, jump right in\n\nAnd ooh ooh, let's begin\n\nAnd we can see don't have to be\n\nA big step, just imagine\n\nTake a breath, let it happen\n\nWhen I hear you laugh\n\nIt sets me free, it sets me free\n\n\n\nI feel alive\n\nAnd can we try\n\nTo leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same\n\nAnd here we are\n\nWe've come so far\n\nLet's leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same\n\nI feel alive\n\nAnd can we try\n\nTo leave it better than how it came\n\nDon't be afraid to change\n\nOur love is still the same, still the same, still the same"
