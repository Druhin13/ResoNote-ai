  "lyrics": "I made it up to Nashville, played the park\r\nI took a broken guitar through the heart\r\nAnd I chased a girl to New Orleans\r\nShe lit me up on Bourbon spring\r\nSo I headed up to Memphis on the train\n\nGot side tracked in the Mississippi rain\n\nPicked up a case of delta blues\n\nBut I washed it down with Tennessee booze\n\n\n\nThere ain't no grass gonna grow up under my feet\n\nNo telling where I might be\n\nI can always find one hell of a time\n\nWhile I'm out here looking for me\n\n\n\nNo stone unturned\n\nNo turn unstoned\n\n\n\nWell Colorado put me in the clouds\n\nI still don't think my feet had touched the ground\n\nI sat tonight on fire and in LA\n\nHell I'm just glad nobody knew my name\n\n\n\nWell there ain't no grass gonna grow up under my feet\n\nNo telling where I might be\n\nI can always find one hell of a time\n\nWhile I'm out here looking for me\n\n\n\nNo stone unturned\n\nNo turn unstoned\n\n\n\nI'm drawn to the chaos and the wind\n\nCan't help but take a look round the damn\n\nAnd one day I'll probably settle down\n\nBut there's still a lot of lost to be found\n\n\n\nThere ain't no grass gonna grow up under my feet\n\nNo telling where I might be\n\nI can always find one hell of a time\n\nWhile I'm out here looking for me\n\n\n\nNo stone unturned\n\nNo turn unstoned\n\nNo stone unturned\n\nNo turn unstoned"
