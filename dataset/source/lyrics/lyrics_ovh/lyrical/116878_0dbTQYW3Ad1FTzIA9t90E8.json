  "lyrics": "I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee\r\nHope it ain't too many feelings involved\r\nI see niggas in this bitch, stuntin', popping bottles\r\nGetting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed\r\nFall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her\n\nThen she let us in, we take all of your shit\n\nAnd when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it\n\nI be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches\n\nI tell her, \"Get 'em\" she say, \"I got you\"\n\nI say, \"No, bitch, I say get 'im\"\n\nAnd they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties\n\nAnd she give us the word, we come through with AKs\n\nIt's a stick up, she scream like a victim\n\nNow you feeling so silly\n\nI smoke color purple\n\nI'm up in here feeling like Celie (ooh)\n\nNappy ass dreads, what's that you say?\n\nWatch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (ooh)\n\nYou can get snaked, you can get faced\n\nI'll buy the bitch that you feeling\n\n'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee\n\nAnd you telling your business, she tell me your business\n\nYou tell that bitch what you're feeling\n\nAll of the beans you be spilling\n\nTo you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings\n\nShe know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden\n\nShe know when you're gone, tell me when to visit, we'll break in your home\n\nAnd take the specifics and meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him so she don't get blamed\n\nWe don't snatch chains, we find out addresses\n\nAnd we don't leave messes\n\nYou only know that it's gone when you check it\n\nThen your first thought is to start second guessing\n\nShe say, \"What's wrong?\"\n\nYou say, \"Nothing, keep resting\"\n\nShe say, \"What's missing?\" \"How you know something missing?\"\n\nHe scratch his head, she say get back in bed\n\nAnd she gave him some head\n\nBoy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say\n\nOoh, I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', popping bottles\n\nGetting drunk with these bitches and when they leave, they get followed\n\nI be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we following\n\nGet them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, don't be so obvious\n\nMona Lisa\n\nLong hair, don't care, she handle the business and don't ever tell\n\nShe bite the bullet and cough up the shells\n\nShe tell 'im, \"Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place\"\n\nAnd if he say, \"Yeah,\" then we meet him there\n\nShe feed him lies with his silverware\n\nShe don't want love, she just want her share\n\nI, know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his\n\n'Cause she tell him that it is\n\nSo he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears\n\nAnd then she tell me, and I be all ears\n\nAnd then I go and tell my people, and they already know him\n\nAnd then I call Liz and she say he comin' over\n\nI say, \"Good girl, just remember what I told you\"\n\nShe gave me the salute, I say, \"Girl, you're a soldier\"\n\nWe're waitin' outside, watch him pull up\n\nWalk up to the door and right before he knock, she open the door naked\n\nShe left it unlocked\n\nThey started French kissing so he didn't see moi\n\nAnd then she let him in, they stopped on the couch\n\nMusic up loud with his head in the cloud\n\nTurn that shit down and I scared the piss out of him\n\nPiss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown\n\nNigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down\n\nYou know what it is, put your fucking hands up\n\nLiz, that's enough, you can put your hands down\n\nAnd then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her\n\nShe a good actress and you a dead actor\n\nYou'll be dead after we get what we're after\n\nIf Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh\n\nI got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga\n\nBut think for me, nigga\n\nSend her to you like she ain't for me, nigga\n\nI hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga\n\nShe pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga\n\nShe slip something in it, now thank for me, nigga\n\nMona Lisa, I done painted the picture\n\nMo-mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas\n\nPussy got you out of character, nigga\n\nYou fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga\n\nTake everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion\n\nWe have you attention and now you're looking down a barrel though, nigga\n\nNow she looking for her pantyhose, nigga\n\nWe just looking for the casserole, nigga\n\nBut she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga\n\n\n\nAh, everyday she wake up with a different color make up\n\nAnd I promise to go take her to the movie and the mall\n\nChilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, fourth minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball\n\nPaparazzi looking at them both popping up and take a picture, uh\n\nProbably on a Internet blog\n\nIn a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her on his mother\n\nMan, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow\n\nMona Lisa\n\nPussy good enough, it got 'em sending into wars\n\nAnd he digging in it like he living in it\n\nMake a new religion with it\n\nMan a nigga 'bout to go against God\n\nPoetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him, did he want to make love in a yellow taxi\n\nNever gave two fuck, jumped in the backseat\n\nWoke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby\n\nThen he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie\n\nI'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughing\n\nI'ma call up again like I did last week\n\nMake good with the friend and I'm more jazzy\n\nBritney with the twin and the girl Ashley\n\nFound out that I fucked, he was unhappy\n\nBitch, I never let the bullshit get past me\n\nBetter yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me\n\n'Bout a motherfucking double standard, acting\n\nFucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone\n\nBut you sucked this dick, that's just nasty\n\nMatter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone (No)\n\nYou fucking with Wayne? (No)\n\nBitch, gimme your phone\n\n(No, let me take this call real quick)\n\n...lick me like a lollipop\n\nHe on your fucking ringtone?\n\nIs that the shit that you do?\n\nTouching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos\n\nJump on the internet, watching his interviews\n\nI don't know what the fuck, lately gotten into you\n\nTell me who love you, I bet I love harder\n\nForgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?\n\nThe pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma daycare after school\n\nAnd she never did charge her\n\nYou scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up\n\nYou know what, I get buck, let me go get my gun, I got one in the chamber\n\nI'm plannin' on aimin', God dammit, you know that the damage is done\n\nBitch I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress\n\nI'm not supposed to go through this, I guess\n\nSo in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killing that pussy I'm killing myself\n\n\n\nShe say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\n\nOoh, fake smile, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\n\nShe say, ooh, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa\n\nNow he get the picture Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah"
