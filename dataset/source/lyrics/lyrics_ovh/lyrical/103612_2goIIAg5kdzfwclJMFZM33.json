  "lyrics": "I'm on my own, broke and alone\r\nI feel the rain crashing down\r\nAll around this empty town\r\nI'm searching for the lost and found\r\nBut you don't care, you're unaware\r\nKeep moving like the scars aren't even there\n\nIt's in the air, like a blazing flare\n\nJust stay 'cause the flames will burn us\n\nThought you were the one for me\n\nThat's why I gave you everything\n\nHeld you close by the stormy seas\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nI used to kiss your head when you cried for me\n\nHold your hand while the pain was all around\n\nKeep you warmed by the roaring sea\n\nOh you meant the world to me\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nMy darling dear, you're never here\n\nWhen I'm in pain you hide and disappear\n\nLike shadows in the atmosphere\n\nCharming the stratosphere yeah\n\nI prayed for you, and catch your knee\n\nAnd host you chase away my fears\n\nI'm on my own, you made it so\n\nAnd now I'm chasing nightmares through your pain\n\nI used to grown with you to the gravy leaves\n\nLaugh at you when you laugh at me\n\nHope for us because I believed\n\nThe home was just you and me\n\nI felt you were the one for me\n\nThat's why I gave you everything\n\nHeld you close by the stormy seas\n\nOh you meant the world to me\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nOh I'm gonna do this on my own\n\nNot poison blaming you-you did not know\n\nOooh\n\nI felt you were the one for me\n\nThat's why I gave you everything\n\nHeld you close by the stormy seas\n\nOh you meant the world to me\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nOh, you meant the world to me\n\nOh I'm gonna do this on my own\n\nNot poison blaming you-you did not know\n\nOooh\n\nOh I'm gonna do this on my own\n\nNot point in blaming you, you did not know\n\nOooh\n\nI felt you were the one for me\n\nThat's why I gave you everything\n\nHeld you close by the stormy seas\n\nOh you meant the world to me"
