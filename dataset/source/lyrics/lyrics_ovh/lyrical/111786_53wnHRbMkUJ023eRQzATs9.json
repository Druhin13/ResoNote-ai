Damn\r\nTalking to myself like \"Now, what's the play\"?\r\nKiki this is bullshit, damn\r\nYou know you ain't new to this\r\nMake the same mistakes\n\nAll we do is fuck then regret it\n\nFuck and forget it\n\nI won't let it get like that\n\nEvery little thing that you say\n\nI put to rest, I ain't going to get like that\n\n\n\nI can't let this love get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way\n\nI can't let this love get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way\n\nEvery time that we exchange in conversation I won't listen to a thing that you've got to say\n\nAlways telling me you want me that you need me saying you ain't running games, you ain't tryna play\n\n\n\nAnyway I'm on a different wave\n\nI got people to see, you know I got places to go\n\nI ain't even really tripping\n\nI'm just letting you know\n\nWe gotta stop running in circles, start letting it go\n\n\n\nAll we do is fuck then regret it\n\nFuck and forget it\n\nI won't let it get like that\n\nEvery single thing that you say\n\nI put to rest, I ain't going to get like that\n\n\n\nI can't let this love get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way\n\nI can't let this love get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way\n\n\n\nNah, now we doin' this again like I knew we would\n\nGot me fucking up my plans, knowing that I shouldn't\n\nTake a minute, take a second just to think it through\n\nAnd I know I could do better but trust me\n\nIt's not my fault I can't leave it alone\n\nTrying my hardest but it ain't easy at all\n\nEveryday we say exchange in conversation\n\nThen I know that this is it we won't ever change\n\n\n\n'Cause all we do is fuck then regret it\n\nFuck and forget it\n\nI won't let it get like that\n\nEvery single thing that you say\n\nI put to rest, I ain't going to get like that\n\n\n\nI can't let this love get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way\n\nI can't let this love get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way, get in way, get in the way\n\nNah"
