  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Nightclub par The Vaccines\r\nI wake up in the morning with the evening in my eye\nAnd by the time I get there, it becomes apparent why\nAll the voices singing to me, like some sort of choir\nThat you can't fight fire with the feeling of desire\n\nSo I become a bubble-bath for my sociopath\nWith the God-given right of the socialite\nShe said she only thinks of love like a long weekend\nBut she might jump in if I show her to the deep end\n\n\nYeah\nAnd it makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head\n\nShe says that if I wanted romance I could find it in a path\nBut if I wanna face the music then I only have to ask\nShe sings me want to know as if we're sitting 'round the fire\nAnd there ain't no feeling like the feeling of desire\n\nYeah\nAnd it makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head feel like a nightclub\n\nIt makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head\n\nAnd it makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head feel like a nightclub\nIt makes my head feel like a nightclub\nSo take me for a ride 'til the morning after\nIt makes my head"
