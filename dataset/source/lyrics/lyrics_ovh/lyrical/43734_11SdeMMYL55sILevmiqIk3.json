  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Drifting Together par Edwin Klift\r\nWe have been back on and back on it for a while\nWhat we gonna do\nWhat we gonna do now\nWe could be movin’ to slow-jams just you and I\nSo what we gonna do\nWhat we gonna do now\nHonestly, I’m sick of the secrecy\nJust wanna let go of fear, and let our worlds melt into each other\n\nDance with me, dance with me\nOh baby feel my beat, feel my beat\nCome over whine with me easily, drifting together\n\nDance with me, dance with me\nOh baby feel my beat, feel my beat\n\nCome over whine with me easily, drifting together\n\nObstacles gone, now i’m free to give all to you\nIt should be you and I\nIt should be you and I, boy\nWalking through sand, sunset night made me realise\nIt should be you and I\nIt should be you and I, boy\nHonestly, I’m sick of the secrecy\nJust wanna let go of fear, and let our worlds melt into each other\n\nDance with me, dance with me\nOh baby feel my beat, feel my beat\nCome over whine with me easily, drifting together\n\nDance with me, dance with me\n\nOh baby feel my beat, feel my beat\nCome over whine with me easily, drifting together"
