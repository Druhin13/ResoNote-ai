  "lyrics": "I say, here stand I\r\nI can't do otherwise\r\nBut is it enough?\r\nAnd why'd you look so tough?\r\nBack at Patrick Park\r\nWe stood in the dark\n\nIn my beer-stained mind\n\nI said \"please won't you be mine?\"\n\n\n\nThere's something dark hangin' over my head\n\nI'm seventeen, don't hold your breath\n\nThere's something dark hangin' over my head\n\nI'm seventeen, don't hold your breath\n\n\n\nOn the high school lot\n\nYou'd kiss me so long\n\nBut lessons don't last\n\nWhen I'm playing you so fast\n\n\n\nThere's something dark hangin' over my head\n\nI'm seventeen, don't hold your breath\n\nThere's something dark hangin' over my head\n\nI'm seventeen, don't hold your breath\n\n\n\nPunch and first collapse\n\nDrunk at winter dance\n\nLooks in red dress\n\nOh, what an awful mess\n\n\n\nThere's something dark hangin' over my head\n\nI'm seventeen, don't hold your breath\n\nThere's something dark hangin' over my head\n\nI'm seventeen, don't hold your breath"
