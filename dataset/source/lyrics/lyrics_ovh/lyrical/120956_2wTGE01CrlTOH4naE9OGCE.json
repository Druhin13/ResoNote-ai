No me, me, God atone me\n\nOh I'm really feeling like I made this bitch\n\nI know that's my ego, I know I'm just empty\n\nThe sentiment for the people\n\nThe sacrifice for my hoes, I'm gonna rob the church for the steeple\n\nI bought you Game 5 tickets, made my pussy the sequel\n\nSo you really don't think about me?\n\nAnd you really don't miss me?\n\nThough I lullaby your brokenness, believe me I'm Ripley\n\nBut you struggling to love yourself, believe me that's karma\n\nYou want a nasty bitch, psychiatrist that cook like your mama\n\nAnd all you got was me-me-me\n\nBut I love you even though we're not meant to be, I still love you\n\nI hope you find everything that you want, and she loves you\n\nEverything is everything just know that I love you\n\n\n\nQuit looking out the window, go find yourself\n\nCome get the bag with your kinfolk, don't doubt your wealth\n\nQuit looking out the window, go find yourself\n\nCome get the bag with your kinfolk"
