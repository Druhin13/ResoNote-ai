  "lyrics": "Enter the nights, all remain\r\nMake me get up off my feet\r\nTake the beat out of my heart\r\nNow the people might believe\r\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, and I knew it was you\n\nAnd I knew, I knew, and I knew, I knew it was you-ooh\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, I knew it was you\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew\n\n\n\nMoments fall like crimson nights\n\nSome stick to my skin tonight\n\nTake a breath and shake them off\n\nEyes ahead, don't you wait too long\n\n\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, and I knew it was you\n\nAnd I knew, I knew, and I knew, I knew it was you-ooh\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, I knew it was you\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew\n\n\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, and I knew it was you\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, I knew it was you-ooh\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, I knew it was you\n\nAnd I knew, and I knew, and I knew, and I knew it was you"
