  "lyrics": "Who cares 'bout star signs?\r\nI’m hardwired to be with you\r\nYou're like a sunrise and I'm scared that I’ll never get enough of you\r\nNobody called it a starfall\r\nCome out the blue\n\nI'm all butterflies\n\nI'm sky-high for you\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like this, like a light came on\n\nAnd you look at me like I'm all you want\n\nI got everything at my fingertips\n\nHow can I resist when it feels like this?\n\n\n\nUncover secrets\n\nTreasure hunting days away\n\nStumbling on diamonds\n\nI'm speechless and blown away\n\nThe little things\n\nI'm shivering\n\nThe way you hold my hand\n\n\n\nI'm all butterflies\n\nI'm sky-high for you\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like this, like a light came on\n\nAnd you look at me like I’m all you want\n\nI got everything at my fingertips\n\nHow can I resist when it feels like this?\n\n\n\nLike you were always meant to be\n\nRight here next to me\n\nIn your faded denim jeans (when it feels like this)\n\nLike we were always meant to be\n\nTo think I never knew it ’til now\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like this, like a light came on\n\nWhen you look at me like I'm all you want\n\nI got everything at my fingertips\n\nHow can I resist?\n\nWhen it feels like this, like a light came on\n\nWhen you look at me, say I’m all you want\n\nI got everything at my fingertips\n\nHow can I resist when it feels like this?"
