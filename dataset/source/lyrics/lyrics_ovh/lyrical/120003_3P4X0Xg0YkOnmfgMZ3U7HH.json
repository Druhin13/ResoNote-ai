with some fear\n\nHe said that he ain't tell, what he said ain’t gon' stick\n\nFly in, then you don't fuck, then I'm not payin' for your expense\n\nI told him order that Benz but send in back up, it ain't the kin\n\nNiggas stick your hand in, always ask for a hand out\n\nI'm fuckin' up with my backend, I walk in Chanel and I cash out\n\nI need that check\n\nI need that check, I need that check, I need that check\n\nI need that check, I need that, I need that check\n\nI need that check, I need that check, I need that check\n\nI need that check, I need that check, I need that check\n\n\n\nI need
