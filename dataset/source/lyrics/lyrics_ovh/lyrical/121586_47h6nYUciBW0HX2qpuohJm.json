  "lyrics": "Yeah, I'm feelin' like a Hip Hop legend\r\nWhen I'm steppin' in the session\r\nOnly time I lift this mic's to be the best in my profession\r\nOnly time I see a rival's when I'm checkin' my reflection\r\nAnytime I see my rival I say \"Damn, that kid is handsome.\"\r\nI ain't never been no thug\n\nI use this pencil as a weapon\n\nAnd when I get to writin', you'll need medical attention\n\nAll these loyal listeners is what I measure my success in\n\nBut in a conversation I don't ever get a mention\n\nBut it's cool, I paid my dues\n\nAnd to my fans, I'm still that dude\n\nI get no press but I make my moves\n\nAnd I own my music unlike you\n\nAnd I seen a bunch of these rappers that seem to be bubblin' faster\n\nBut they don't be stackin' like Webby be stackin'\n\nI follow my pub and I master some doublin' up when they hustlin' backwards\n\nI'm just one of hundreds of rappers\n\nBut now I have carved my own lane, that I'm livin' in brilliant rugged, resilient, flippin' middle fingers up to the system so fuck your opinion!\n\nSippin' my whiskey with a little skinny bitty, with a butt that's Brazilian\n\nAnd got a pretty Sicilian up in my kitchen that's cooking and servin' me chicken\n\nAnd that's just perks of the job I guess, but I digress\n\nCause I am just\n\nSo out of here that I'm Elon Musk\n\nIn a full space suit with a flight to catch\n\nYou never seen a sight so fresh\n\nWhen I jump on stage and do my thing\n\nBuilt my castle now I'm king, kiss the ring\n\n\n\nYeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend\n\nI been underground for now, but shit been spreadin'\n\nMaybe not the guy that they usually mention\n\nBut let 'em sleep, while I creep\n\nTo the top, I'm a beast\n\nYeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend\n\nA motherfucking Hip-Hop legend\n\nMaybe not the guy that they usually mention\n\nBut while they sleep, I can bet\n\nEvery week, they'll repeat\n\n\n\nWebby did hit me to come through and body 'em\n\nTold me to dunk it\n\n'Cause he boutta lobby it\n\nI just be walking 'round, feeling like Jordan\n\n'Cause none of them niggas can tell you where Scottie is\n\nI don't be doing this shit for the audience\n\nNiggas be hating, I'm losing away\n\nBut look at the clothes that are fitting my body\n\nAnd look like I'm working, I'm getting it paid\n\nCome at me quick and I'm getting it straight\n\nMannequin Challenge, you niggas is fake\n\nNiggas that don't know that I'm rolling it loud\n\nAnd outperforming, you niggas is late\n\nScrew them niggas, screw the rest, screw the figures, screw the checks\n\nShoot the Tec, shoot his chest, shoot his legs, shoot his neck\n\nWho to kill and who the best (JAG)\n\nLong grind nigga, get to work\n\nKiller being, tell 'em get the hearse\n\nI very seldom do features, (yeah)\n\n'cause niggas dying when they get the verse\n\nHave a nigga laying with the dirt\n\n'cause a nigga ill, better get the nurse\n\nI done kill so many nigga's beats\n\nGotta pray to god when I get to church\n\nGet out your phonies and nigga I'm through\n\nNone of you niggas can get on my crew\n\nBack in the days, I was up on the block\n\nHandle the rock, all my skill through my loot\n\nYou know how I do\n\nLook how I come with the latest, feel like the one who just made it\n\nBet you all faded, I know these niggas gon' hate it\n\n\n\nYeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend\n\nI been underground for now, but shit been spreadin'\n\nMaybe not the guy that they usually mention\n\nBut let 'em sleep, while I creep\n\nTo the top, I'm a beast\n\nYeah I'm feelin' like a Hip-Hop legend\n\nA motherfucking Hip-Hop legend\n\nMaybe not the guy that they usually mention\n\nBut while they sleep, I can bet\n\nEvery week, they'll repeat\n\n\n\nI been through hell and back\n\nNiggas be getting deals and don't be getting they money\n\nBut they ain't 'gon tell you that\n\nYou've buying the bullshit the industry niggas be talking and hope you can sell it back\n\nFor beginners, I'll give you some wisdom\n\nThat life is a trip and you fell for that\n\nWell I was trapped in the cell, I'm back\n\nQuit, I'm like, \"never that!\"\n\nEveryday another rapper coming up and wanna talk about it, how they got a million dollars\n\nBut they never wanna talk about the drama that's behind it, never mind it\n\n'Cause you'd rather just go back to the hood, just be quiet\n\nEverybody had that little fantasy, I mean they had that little rapper dream\n\nAbout how they gonna be on the cover of every magazine, but never had a team\n\nNever had management, get money now they don't know how to manage it\n\n(wait)\n\nI know it's all complicated, but to be in your top 5 conversation\n\nThere's way too much confrontations, so am I being properly compensated?\n\nBusiness and art\n\nMan, that's a hell of a combination\n\nAnd fakeness was not how my momma raised me\n\nSo I ain't expecting no nomination\n\nMe and fuck niggas do not get along\n\nThink that I care about comments, you wrong\n\nFuck it, I love it, these rappers is puppets\n\nI'm watching these labels just string you along\n\nSaying that balling, but you need a loan\n\nDon't believe words, I believe what I'm shown\n\nDon't fall into debt man, it's better to own\n\nAnd I'ma stay real like it's written in stone\n\nI'ma be great to the ones that I'm grateful\n\nYou ain't gotta like me, and I ain't tryna make you\n\nI'ma stay humble, I'ma stay grateful\n\nIf you fuck with me then I'ma say, \"Thank you\"\n\nIf you ain't strong in this game, it'll break you\n\nI give a fuck about a list on how they raised you\n\nI'ma legend to the ones who was faithful\n\nConnor"
