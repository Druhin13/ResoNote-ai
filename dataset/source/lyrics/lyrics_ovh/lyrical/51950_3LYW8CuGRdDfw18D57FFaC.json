  "lyrics": "You took your time to come back this time\r\nThe grass has grown under your feet\r\nIn your absence I've changed my mind\r\nAnd someone else is sitting in your seat\r\nI know that I said there be no-one else\r\nI know that I said I'd be true\n\nBut baby - I've burned out cupid's arrow\n\nAnd here's the short and the narrow\n\nI've nothing left to offer you\n\nAll cried out\n\nYou took a whole lot of loving for a handful of nothing\n\nAll cried out\n\nIt's hard to give you something when you're pushing and a shoving me around\n\n\n\nSo don't look surprised there was no disguise\n\nYou knew where I stood from the start\n\nSo stop - look around you\n\nYou're right back where I found you\n\nTake back your cold and empty heart\n\n\n\nAll cried out\n\nYou took a whole lot of loving for a handful of nothing\n\nAll cried out\n\nIt's hard to give you something when you're pushing and a shoving me around\n\n\n\nYou go your way\n\nI'll go mine\n\nI wont stay around here\n\nDon't you waste my time"
