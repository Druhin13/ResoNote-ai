  "lyrics": "When I was a child my family would travel\r\nDown to Western Kentucky where my parents were born\r\nAnd there's a backwards old town that's often remembered\r\nSo many times that my memories are worn.\r\nChorus:\n\nAnd daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County\n\nDown by the Green River where Paradise lay\n\nWell, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking\n\nMister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away\n\n\n\nWell, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River\n\nTo the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill\n\nWhere the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols\n\nBut empty pop bottles was all we would kill.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nThen the coal company came with the world's largest shovel\n\nAnd they tortured the timber and stripped all the land\n\nWell, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken\n\nThen they wrote it all down as the progress of man.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nWhen I die let my ashes float down the Green River\n\nLet my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam\n\nI'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'\n\nJust five miles away from wherever I am.\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:"
