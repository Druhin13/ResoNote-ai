  "lyrics": "Hold up a light, steady a bright\r\nOut like a knife through the cold and dark\r\nThese eager flames can't be contained\r\nCities are claimed by the smallest spark\r\nIt's raining and I know we're tired\n\nBut try to raise your lamps a little higher up\n\n\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light till the morning comes\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light till the world is won\n\n\n\nSoaking and scared - worse for the wear\n\nBut still we dare for the light of the day\n\nDarkness above but we're dreaming of the\n\nNew day when love burns this night away\n\n\n\nIt's raining and I know we're tired\n\nBut try to raise your lamps a little higher up\n\n\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light till the morning comes\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light till the world is won\n\n\n\nHold up a light, steady a bright\n\nOut like a knife through the cold and dark\n\nThese eager flames can't be contained\n\nCities are claimed by the smallest spark\n\n\n\nIt's raining and I know we're tired\n\nBut try to raise your lamps a little higher up\n\n\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light till the morning comes\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light\n\nHold up a light till the world is won"
