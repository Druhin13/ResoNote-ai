  "lyrics": "I can feel it's gone, that alter in my soul.\r\nTo be collected.\r\nRunning up and down the walls of your nest.\r\nIt never ends. (It never ends)\r\nTo build it up again, we get high.\r\nTo see if I wanted in, (I can feel it's gone) we stand. (It never ends)\n\nI don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come.\n\nTo see it for what it is...\n\nYou lost all intent. We use to be such good friends.\n\nThen you found a way out to break it down again. (I can feel its gone)\n\nWe get high. (It never ends)\n\nAnd I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come.\n\nAnd I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come.\n\nTo see if I wanted in, we gave up. We gave up our lives to be here.\n\nWho else is waiting here? I'm lost inside of your world.\n\nTo break it down again, we get high.\n\nTo see if I wanted in (I can feel it's gone) We stand (it never ends)\n\nOur eyes are barely open, our limitations gone.\n\nAnd I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you would come\n\nAnd I don't wanna spend my whole life waiting, my whole life wondering when you'd come. (You'd found a way out)"
