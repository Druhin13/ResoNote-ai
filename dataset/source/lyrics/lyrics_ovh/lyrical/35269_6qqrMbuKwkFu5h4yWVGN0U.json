  "lyrics": "When night is falling so hard upon you\r\nAnd the world is hanging heavy on your heart\r\nWhen your soul is stranded, you're barely standing\r\nI will hold you, shield you, show you I am standing by\r\nAnd when you're lost and think no one can find you\n\nI will remind you, you're not alone\n\nI will be there, I'll be the one to guide you\n\nMy love will be your compass, I will lead you home\n\n\n\nWhen life is painting your world in shadows\n\nAnd you're left feeling left out in the cold\n\nWhen you're in the darkness, and this world feels heartless\n\nI will see you, hear you, reach you, I am standing by\n\n\n\nAnd when you're lost and think no one can find you\n\nI will remind you, you're not alone\n\nI will be there, I'll be the one to guide you\n\nMy love will be your compass, I will lead you home\n\n\n\nWhen you're in the storm and you're\n\nIn the dark and lost at sea\n\nGrab my hand and reach for me\n\nI am standing by\n\n\n\nAnd when you're lost and think no one can find you\n\nI will remind you, you're not alone\n\nI will be there, I'll be the one to guide you\n\nMy love will be your compass, I will lead you home\n\nI will lead you home\n\nLet my love be your compass\n\nI will lead you home\n\nI will lead you home"
