  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Truth Hits Everybody par The Police\r\nSleep lay behind me like a broken ocean\nStrange waking dreams before my eyes unfold\nYou lay there sleeping like an open doorway\nI stepped outside myself and felt so cold\n\nTake a look at my new toy\nIt'll blow your head in two, oh boy\n\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nOh, oh, oh\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\n\n\nI thought about it and my dream was broken\nI clutch at images like dying breath\nAnd I don't want to make a fuss about it\nThe only certain thing in [life is death]\nTake a look at my new toy\nIt'll blow your head in two, oh boy\n\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nOh, oh, oh\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\n\nWhere you want to be\nWon't you ever see\n\n\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nOh, oh, oh\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nTruth hits everybody\nTruth hits everyone\nNow"
