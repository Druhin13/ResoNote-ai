  "lyrics": "You say there's so much you don’t know\r\nYou need to go and find yourself\r\nYou say you'd rather be alone\r\n'Cause you think you won’t find it tied to someone else\r\nOoo, who said it's true\n\nThat the growing only happens on your own?\n\nThey don't know me and you\n\n\n\nI don't think you have to leave\n\nIf to change is what you need\n\nYou can change right next to me\n\nWhen you're high, I'll take the lows\n\nYou can ebb and I can flow\n\nAnd we'll take it slow\n\nAnd grow as we go\n\nGrow as we go\n\n\n\nYou won't be the only one\n\nI am unfinished, I’ve got so much left to learn\n\nI don’t know how this river runs\n\nBut I'd like the company through every twist and turn\n\n\n\nOoo, who said it’s true\n\nThat the growing only happens on your own?\n\nThey don't know me and you\n\n\n\nYou don't ever have to leave\n\nIf to change is what you need\n\nYou can change right next to me\n\nWhen you're high, I’ll take the lows\n\nYou can ebb and I can flow\n\nAnd we'll take it slow\n\nAnd grow as we go\n\nGrow as we go\n\nGrow as we go\n\nGrow as we go\n\n\n\nI don't know who we'll become\n\nI can't promise it's not written in the stars\n\nBut I believe that when it's done\n\nWe're gonna see that it was better\n\nThat we grew up together\n\n\n\nTell me you don't wanna leave\n\n'Cause a change is what you need\n\nYou can change right next to me\n\nWhen you're high, I'll take the lows\n\nYou can ebb and I can flow\n\nWe'll take it slow\n\nAnd grow as we go\n\nGrow as we go\n\nGrow as we go\n\nGrow as we go"
