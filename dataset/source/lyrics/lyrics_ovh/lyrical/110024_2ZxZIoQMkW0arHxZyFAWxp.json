  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Trust My Lonely par Alessia Cara\r\nIt's time I let you go\nI made the mistake, go writing your name on my heart\n'Cause you colours showed\nBut it was too late, you left me stained, called it art\nDo you crave control?\nI've been your doll, that you poke for fun too long\nSo you should go\nDon't look back, I won't come back\nCan't do that no more\n\nGo get your praise from someone else\nYou did a number on my health\nMy world is brighter by itself\n\nAnd I can do better, do better\nYou and I were swayin' on the ropes\nI found my footing on my own\nI'm a-okay, I'm good as gold\nAnd I can do better, do better alone\nAlone, alone\n\nThere ain't no love 'round here\nI loved you once, but it made me dumb\nNow I'm seeing it way too clear\nYou hurt me numb, and for that I've run out of time\nTo have pain to feel (Pain to feel)\nI've been your game\nJust taking the blame for too long\nGet on out of here\nDon't look back, I won't come back\nCan't do that no more\n\n\nGo get your praise from someone else\nYou did a number on my health\nMy world is brighter by itself\nAnd I can do better, do better\nYou and I were swayin' on the ropes\nI found my footing on my own\nI'm a-okay, I'm good as gold\nAnd I can do better, do better alone\nAlone, alone\n\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\n\nI gotta trust my lonely\n\nGo get your praise from someone else\nYou did a number on my health\nMy world is brighter by itself\nAnd I can do better, do better\nYou and I were swayin' on the ropes\nI found my footing on my own\nI'm a-okay, I'm good as gold\nAnd I can do better, do better alone\nAlone, alone\n\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely\n\nDon't you know that you're bad for me?\nI gotta trust my lonely"
