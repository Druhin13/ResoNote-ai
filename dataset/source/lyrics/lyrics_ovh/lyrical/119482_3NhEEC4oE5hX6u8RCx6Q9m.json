  "lyrics": "Look how you found me\r\nNo one else sees this but you, but you\r\n‘Cause once you told me\r\nIf something’s missing in me\r\nTo go and find it in you\n\nA piece of me ain’t there\n\n‘Cause nothing can compare\n\nTo life when I was young\n\nThat girl inside me stays\n\nIf I’m not here for me\n\nShe will be there\n\n\n\nDadadadadada\n\n\n\nLook how you found me\n\nA broken part enough for two\n\nFor me and you\n\nJust reminiscence of the best parts of my youth\n\nI wish I was her for good\n\n\n\nA piece of me ain’t there\n\n‘Cause nothing can compare\n\nTo life when I was young\n\nThat girl inside me stays\n\nIf I’m not here for me\n\nShe will be there\n\n\n\nDadadadadada\n\n\n\nMessages from her\n\nMessages to her\n\nMessages from her\n\nMessages to her\n\nMessages from her\n\nMessages to her\n\n\n\nIf I’m not here for me\n\nShe will be\n\n\n\nA piece of me ain’t there\n\n‘Cause nothing can compare\n\nTo life when I was young\n\nThat girl inside me stays\n\nIf I’m not here for me\n\nShe will be there\n\n\n\nLook how you found me\n\nSearching for messages from you"
