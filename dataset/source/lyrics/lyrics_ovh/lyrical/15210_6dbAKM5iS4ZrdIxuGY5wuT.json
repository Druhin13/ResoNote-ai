  "lyrics": "In my dreams I'm in that grey room\r\nIn my chest I'm feeling dark blue\r\nTake the redline into downtown\r\nI'm trying to escape you\r\nCrying on the subway\n\n'Cause I remember on that Thursday\n\nHow everything was different\n\nOh, I'm always gonna miss it\n\n\n\nIf I could ever change things\n\nIf I could ever forget\n\nI would be no longer living\n\nOh, you know I'll always say yes\n\n\n\nIf you should end up winning\n\nIf I should ever regret\n\nI will be no longer living\n\nOh, you know I'll always say yes"
