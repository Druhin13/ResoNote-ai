  "lyrics": "2005 Just kept bringing me down\r\nAnd I kept falling for what others said\r\nLike how I'd never be the one to leave\r\nAnd push this god damn ship to the end\r\nBut they were wrong\n\nI worked my bones until I had nothing left\n\nAnd now I see it for what its worth\n\nAnd I'm writing down the words I really want you to hear\n\nAnd that's what 10 fucking years will do\n\n\n\nIt's been 10 whole years\n\nI don't wanna see your face\n\nTelling me you've come so far\n\nWhile your drowning in front of me\n\n\n\nI've spent the years trying to find myself\n\nAnd I know I've hit a wall or two\n\nBut I know if I stayed I would never have changed\n\nAnd that's more than I could say for you\n\nI think you know\n\n\n\nI never said that I was better than this\n\nAnd that's exactly why I did the things I thought I would miss\n\nSo why wait\n\nI never thought the answer was there\n\nSo now I'm doing this for myself\n\n\n\nIt's been 10 whole years\n\nI don't wanna see your face\n\nTelling me you've come so far\n\nWhile your drowning in front of me\n\nCause it's the same old fears\n\nThat locked you up inside this cage\n\nAnd now your looking too far gone\n\nAs you stand here in front of me\n\n\n\nIt's been a few long years inside this town\n\nAnd I'm getting ready to bring it down\n\nCause I've, had enough of the things you said\n\nAnd I'm coming to take you on.\n\n\n\nIt's been 10 whole years\n\nI don't wanna see your face\n\nTelling me you've come so far\n\nWhile your drowning in front of me\n\nCause it's the same old fears\n\nThat locked you up inside this cage\n\nAnd now your looking too far gone\n\nAs you stand here in front of me"
