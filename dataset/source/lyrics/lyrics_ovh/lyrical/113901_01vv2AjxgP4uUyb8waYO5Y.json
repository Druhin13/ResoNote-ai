  "lyrics": "Can't stop thinking about if and when I'd die\r\nFor now I see that \"if\" and \"when\" are truly different cries\r\nFor \"if\" is purely panic and \"when\" is solemn sorrow\r\nAnd one invades today while the other spies tomorrow\r\nWe're surrounded and we're hounded\r\nThere's no \"above\", or \"under\", or \"around\" it\n\nFor \"above\" is blind belief and \"under\" is sword to sleeve\n\nAnd \"around\" is scientific miracle, let's pick \"above\" and see\n\nFor if and when we go \"above\", the question still remains\n\nAre we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?\n\nAnd that's when going \"under\" starts to take my wonder\n\nBut until that time, I'll try to sing this\n\n\n\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nWhat they throw at me's too slow\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nI'm just a ghost\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nDefense mechanism mode\n\n\n\nHe'll always try to stop me, that Nicholas Bourbaki\n\nHe's got no friends close but those who know him most know\n\nHe goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy\n\nWhen I'd hear him mock me that's almost stopped me\n\nWell we're surrounded and we're hounded\n\nThere's no above or a secret door. What are we here for?\n\nIf not to run straight through all our tormentors?\n\nBut until that time I'll try and sing this...\n\n\n\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nWhat they throw at me's too slow\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nI'm just a ghost\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nDefense mechanism mode\n\n\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\n\n\nLights they blink to me, transmitting things to me\n\nOnes and zeroes, ergo this symphony\n\nAnybody listening? Ones and zeroes\n\nCount to infinity, ones and zeroes\n\n\n\nI'm surrounded and I'm hounded\n\nThere's no \"above\", or \"under\", or \"around\" it\n\nFor \"above\" is blind belief and \"under\" is sword to sleeve\n\nAnd \"around\" is scientific miracle, let's pick \"above\" and see\n\nFor if and when we go \"above\", the question still remains\n\nAre we still in love and is it possible we feel the same?\n\nAnd that's when going \"under\" starts to take my wonder\n\nBut until that time\n\n\n\nI'll morph to someone else, I'm just a ghost\n\n\n\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nWhat they throw at me's too slow\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nI'm just a ghost\n\nI'll morph to someone else\n\nDefense mechanism mode\n\nIf I keep moving, they won't know\n\nI’ll morph to someone else\n\nDefense mechanism mode\n\nI’ll morph to someone else\n\n\n\nNot done, not done, not done\n\nJosh Dun\n\nI'll morph to someone else"
