La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\nSo sick of love\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\n\n\nLet's keep driving\n\nLet's keep \"never mind\"-ing\n\nThe world we can hide, just stay low\n\nJust stay low\n\n\n\nSalty lashes\n\nBehind these sunglasses\n\nThere's no coming back once we go\n\nOnce we go\n\n\n\nLove was something I used to believe in\n\nI've been burned too many times before\n\nHope is fading, my heart needs replacing\n\nIt can't feel a thing anymore\n\n\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\nSo sick of love\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\n\n\nTake it step by step\n\nTake it day by day\n\nTake it line by line\n\nPush it all away\n\n\n\nI'mma drink this drink\n\n'til I lose my mind\n\nEvery girl I know\n\nLeave 'em all behind\n\n\n\nLove was something I used to believe in\n\nI've been burned too many times before\n\nHope is fading, my heart needs replacing\n\nIt can't feel a thing anymore\n\n\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Love! La-la-la-la-la)\n\nSo sick of love\n\nSo sick of love\n\n(Hey!)\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\nI'm so sick of love\n\nI'm so sick of love"
