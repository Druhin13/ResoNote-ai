  "lyrics": "\"A\" is like a different type of animal\r\nNo brick road, no zip code Xanadu\r\nFamily, his and-what-army party in the panic room\r\nBefore he meet the man he feed his hands into the scramble suit\r\nGlam channels wake up in a fantasy dismantled\r\nWe're championing vandals over Andy with the Campbell's\n\nHe the cold-hearted old guard, Holy Ghost crowbar\n\nThe postcards only know Crayola, no Rose Art\n\nIll communication aside\n\nI'll kick a train off a bridge, I'll smack a plane out the sky\n\nI'll throw a car into the ocean, no one waving goodbye\n\nPlace bets, eight heads and the radio flyin'\n\nThe kid Tobacco is a face in the fire on the fucking mountain\n\nThe bass is like a struggle of defiance\n\nLove and power for Bettys and headhunters\n\nTechies and chess-clubbers\n\nAll I do is eat bread and check suckers\n\n\n\nNobody safe, chump, black plague, railguns\n\nCache of your rat snakes coiled up in the bass drum\n\nDug graves with over-the-hill skate punks\n\nFailures and flakes in the brain trust, pay up, ayy\n\nMy Bugs Bunny tunnel-out is perfect\n\nDon't be there when we bubble to the surface, usurpers\n\nI pay the rent in pennies and ride off into the ether\n\nOn a donkey painted like a zebra, take me to your leader\n\nDetox, re-tox, see how he seesaws\n\nMistletoe a misanthrope, stick-and-poke sea dogs\n\nYou can't imagine all the misery we leap frog\n\nI make rap, I ain't a motherfuckin' peacock\n\nDeath raft floating out to sea\n\nUnder a single flaming arrow down to overcook the meat\n\nAnd if a silhouetted man is seen emerging from the flames\n\nYou should probably treat him different even if he look the same\n\nHe isn't\n\n\n\nI make a mean Suicide Big Gulp, sick pup\n\nGoogle eyes splinter off the unified witch-hunt\n\nWar and love, hailing from the home of the Anthora cup\n\nAnd 40 nights of failures out to plagiarize the formula\n\nBeen seen petty spoils void steady acumen\n\nI'd rather be avoided, a voice of the Voynich Manuscript, boy-o\n\nType to give a name to a sword\n\nThe skulls of his landlords hang from his horse\n\nMedium kahuna, strange force around him\n\nHoundsmen scrounge for a sirloin to pound thin\n\nI play my chess with undomesticated groundlings\n\nWe spend our afternoons forgetting how to downshift\n\n\"Aes ain't here, man,\" \"Aes, I can tell it's you\"\n\n\"Tell it's me from over there, this ain't a fuckin' petting zoo\"\n\nBrain cells peacing out, dentures in a Dixie cup\n\nDevil trying to keep me down, somebody pick me up"
