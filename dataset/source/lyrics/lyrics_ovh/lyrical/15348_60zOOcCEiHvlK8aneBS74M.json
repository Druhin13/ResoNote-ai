  "lyrics": "A rolling of thunder\r\nWolves scolding each other as\r\nThe roses take cover\r\nIn the black of the night\r\nPassions extinguish\r\nIn short, whispered sentences\n\nBanished from memories\n\nIs the thought of yesterday\n\nNow I look past my shoulder\n\nFor the face of my mother\n\nDid I see her smiling\n\nOr was it all a dream?\n\nNo, I seem to recall\n\nThe perfume of roses\n\nToday they’re all hiding\n\nThe dewdrops are frozen\n\n\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake girl\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake world\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake girl\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake world\n\n\n\nCome out, blossom roses\n\nThe wolf is sending messages\n\nSweet perfume of love\n\nJust under our noses\n\nI won’t hold my horses\n\nJust leave what's above\n\nSweet labor of love\n\nJust surrender to the other\n\n\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake girl\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake world\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake girl\n\nHalf fool, half blind, half awake world\n\n\n\nSweet lover, keep loving [x12]\n\n\n\nCome out, sweet hypnosis\n\nI'll never know what overdose is\n\nThe sweet vapor of love\n\nJust like a drug, it discloses\n\nAwaken quiet senses\n\nWe'll write a new synopsis\n\nThe sweet liquor of love\n\nYou left a drop, to discover"
