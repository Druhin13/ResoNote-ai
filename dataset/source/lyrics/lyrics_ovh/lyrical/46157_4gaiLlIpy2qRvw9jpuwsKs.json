Nigga, stop that\n\nBetter fall back, head to the toe wearing all black\n\nMy crew like\n\n\n\nWooooooooo\n\nMy crew like\n\nWooooooooo\n\n\n\nThanks to Kaytranada, my bass is harder\n\nNow the fakes don’t bother to diss\n\nGotta thank my mama cause she made me stronger\n\nWhen I had to deal with that shit\n\nLet me teach you math, I stand and deliver\n\nI’m wavy baby like I ran through a river\n\nMy drank is tasty, it pass through my liver\n\nTake your lady, she asked me get her\n\nLittle feller, I’m a big black nigga\n\nA little fetti, retro Hilfiger\n\nHit it better, you’re no big swinger\n\nI’m a real veteran, you’re an unknown figure\n\nI’m really clever, got my shit together\n\nI’m on the top in this endeavor\n\nIf you’re picking me up, I need a Benz or better\n\nTinted windows, seats filled with leather\n\nScented incense, eucalyptus pepper\n\nGot a crew of bad bitches like this was Heathers\n\nI’m Rollie, homie, my wrist is metal\n\nGot a mean strap and a vicious bezel\n\nWhen he drops, I’m up 60 levels\n\nNo Reeboks, my kicks are special\n\nY3 stacked to the cellar\n\nClean conscience, my vision’s stellar\n\nI’m a green monster when I’m getting cheddar\n\nSqueal off when I hit the pedal\n\nSteam popping, wheels kicking pebbles\n\nLike woooo, baby, who does it better?\n\nYeah, nobody, you’re in a slow jalopy\n\nI’m rolling often, in the lobby loaded\n\nSo confident, got a dope sponsor\n\nHelp me go off until I’m overdosing\n\n\n\nWooooooooo\n\nWooooooooo\n\n\n\nYeah, nigga, what you know?\n\nI do it for the gyal dem, do it for my bros\n\nThey be like, yeah, nigga, what you know?\n\nI do it for the platinum, do it for the gold\n\nMy crew like, yeah, nigga, what you know?\n\nI do it for the gyal dem, do it for the bros\n\nThey be like, yeah, nigga, what you know?\n\nI do it for the platinum, do it for the gold\n\nThey be like"
