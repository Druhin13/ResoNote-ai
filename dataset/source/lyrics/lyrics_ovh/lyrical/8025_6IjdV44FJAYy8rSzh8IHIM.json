  "lyrics": "I, I've been up all week\r\nNot getting any sleep, trying to read the signs\r\nI don't know how much more I can take\r\nHow much longer I can wait before I lose my mind\r\nYou, for heavens sake, you take my breath away\r\nWhen you're not even trying\n\nYou got me wondering why, ooh\n\nWhat if you were mine?\n\n\n\nOh, baby, come on and say it now\n\nJust let the words come out\n\n(Tell me you love me)\n\nIt's easy, to say what's on your mind\n\nSay it a million times\n\n(Tell me you love me)\n\n\n\nTell me, tell me, uh\n\nTell me you love me\n\nTell me, tell me, uh\n\nTell me you love me\n\nTell me, tell me, tell me\n\n\n\nCome on, I know it's way too soon\n\nBut I waited for you, I think that's long enough\n\nSo long to all those lonely nights, battles and picking fights\n\nIt's already evening night, I can't believe my eyes\n\nI wonder if they'll find myself so fall in love\n\nWe could be the perfect match\n\nAnd what's so wrong with that? Mm\n\n\n\nOh, baby, come on and say it now\n\nJust let the words come out\n\n(Tell me you love me)\n\nIt's easy, to say what's on your mind\n\nSay it a million times\n\n(Tell me you love me)\n\n\n\nOh, baby, come on and say it now\n\nJust let the words come out\n\n(Tell me you love me)\n\nIt's easy, to say what's on your mind\n\nSay it a million times\n\n(Tell me you love me)\n\n\n\nTell me, tell me, uh\n\nTell me you love me\n\nTell me, tell me, uh\n\nTell me you love me\n\nTell me, tell me, tell me"
