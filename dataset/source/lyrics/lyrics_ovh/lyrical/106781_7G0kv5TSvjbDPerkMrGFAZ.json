  "lyrics": "There's a darkness that is brighter than our light\r\nThere's a danger, love, to holding on so tight\r\nI'm finally seeing I've been seeing this all wrong\r\nI'm finally seeing now that everything belongs\r\nYeah, everything belongs\r\nEverything belongs\n\n\n\nThere's a shadow that believes in fits and starts\n\nAnd it's the paradox that feeds the famished heart\n\nI'm finally seeing how the spaces make the song\n\nI'm finally seeing now that everything belongs\n\nYeah, everything belongs\n\nEverything belongs\n\n\n\nThere's a web and every thread ties you to me\n\nAnd we are here and now, the future's yet to be\n\nI'm finally seeing that our weakness makes us strong\n\nAnd everything belongs\n\nEverything belongs\n\n\n\nEverything belongs"
