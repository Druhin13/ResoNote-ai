  "lyrics": "You not making no sense\r\nWhen you telling me these lies and kissing my lips\r\nFeel your breathing on my neck, got yo hands on my hips\r\nThink I finally had enough, Imma slip from your grip\r\nProbably pour another cup, need a drink I can sip\r\nIt was something about your walk that I love when it drip\n\nDoes something when you speak and the words that you spit\n\nHad me reaching for the bait then you lured me in\n\nProbably thought I ain't know but lil baby I'm hip\n\nSometimes I wonder who you call when I'm not in your whip\n\nYou know I could've been your trophy, your championship\n\nBut the whole damn time you was running the script\n\n\n\nYou told me you not the same\n\nYou showed me you'd never change\n\nUsed to hold me and say my name\n\nThat was the old me, you stayed the same\n\nYou told me you won't cause pain\n\nAnd lately that's all you made\n\nCalling me baby like that's my name\n\nThat was the old me and not what you told me\n\nAnd not what you told me\n\nAnd not what you told me\n\n\n\nYou said you weren't the same\n\nYou ain't acting no other way\n\nRunning around the city we lost the vibe\n\nCould've save the vibe, I wanted you to decide\n\nYeah, I know any other time\n\nYou treat me like another one of your side chicks\n\nDon't know why I would stay and entertain the games you play\n\nYou ain't making no sense\n\nAll the reasons why I left I can go down the list\n\nDon't know how I went this long without flipping the switch\n\nIt's like I really wear the pants and you really the ugh\n\n\n\nYou told me you not the same\n\nYou showed me you'd never change\n\nUsed to hold me and say my name\n\nThat was the old me, you stayed the same\n\nYou told me you won't cause pain\n\nAnd lately that's all you made\n\nCalling me baby like that's my name\n\nThat was the old me and not what you told me\n\nAnd not what you told me\n\nAnd not what you told me\n\n\n\nYou told me you not the same\n\nYou showed me you'd never change\n\nUsed to hold me and say my name\n\nThat was the old me, you stayed the same\n\nYou told me you won't cause pain\n\nAnd lately that's all you made\n\nCalling me baby like that's my name\n\nThat was the old me and not what you told me"
