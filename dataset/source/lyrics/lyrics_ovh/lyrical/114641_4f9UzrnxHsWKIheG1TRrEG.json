  "lyrics": "Many long years amongst the trees\r\nMany long years in the ground\r\nTo be with one that’s never seen\r\nThe one that stands and watches over\r\nI wonder when we’ll realize\n\nThis is what we got left\n\nAnd it’s our demise\n\nWith the water rising\n\nAnd the air so thin\n\nStill the children smiling\n\nAnd we see no sin\n\n\n\nThis is what we all have seen\n\nToo many years caring down\n\nEven thought we couldn’t believe\n\nIt’s only clearer in a mirror\n\nNow\n\n\n\nI wonder when we’ll realize\n\nThis is what we got left\n\nAnd it’s our demise\n\nWith the water rising\n\nAnd the air so thin\n\nStill the children smiling\n\nCan we see no sin\n\n\n\nSinner sin\n\nSay no sin"
