  "lyrics": "One part water and one part dust\r\nYet You're still making trophies out of us\r\nMaking something out of nothing, it's what You do\r\nYet Your work is never finished and it's never past due\r\nGently Your voice like a calming embrace\n\nCalls me from out of the noise\n\nYou whisper to me, \"Child, forget not your dreams\"\n\nAs we lie awake in the dark\n\nJust don't lose heart\n\n\n\nFrom the dirt to a throne, with a brand new name\n\nIn the blood of the King running through our veins\n\nThereâ€™s hidden gold in these jars of clay\n\nAnd all these hidden crowns will be revealed one day\n\nYeah, we'll lay them down at Your feet one day\n\n\n\nGently Your voice like a calming embrace\n\nCalls me from out of the noise\n\nYou whisper to me, \"Child, forget not your dreams\"\n\nAs we lie awake in the, we lie awake in the\n\nWe lie awake in the dark...\n\n\n\nJust don't lose heart\n\nHe's got your hand\n\nDon't lose heart, child\n\nHe knows your name\n\nAnd when everything is falling apart\n\nDon't lose heart\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen everything is falling apart\n\nJust don't lose heart"
