  "lyrics": "Living my life in a fucked up haze\r\nI know I should pray\r\nRepent everyday, and God is the way\r\nBut I feel as if there is too much to say\r\nI made friends with the dragon that sits at my window\r\nWhat I'm sipping is different and you probably could tell that by the tempo\n\nLiving it fast as the days go by\n\nI see the fire that glows in the sky\n\nI seen it all and I swear I won't lie\n\nThe lions and tigers and bears, oh my\n\nFeel the vibration from knocks on the door\n\nPull out my heart and let it drop on the floor\n\nDrifted away and it washed to the shore\n\nThen I demanded to talk to the lord\n\n\n\nThere's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\nThere's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of the boogieman (There's a monster)\n\nAnd I'm not afraid of the boogieman\n\n'Cause there's a monster inside of me\n\n\n\nI told my daughters not to fear the monsters\n\nDaddy is the boogieman\n\nIt was written, no truth hidden\n\nReal deal, whole again\n\nNot sure if me and my reflection never be cool again\n\n'Cause the man in the mirror now fears a foolish sin\n\nOn the swings at satan's playground I'd try to touch the sky\n\nHumbled by the fall and the fact I'd never die\n\nStaring in the eyes of defeat, cry me a river\n\nHad a dream with the devil, he offered to buy me dinner\n\nCircle getting thinner, graveyard thicken\n\nSee them crews, used to eat now they fighting for slim pickings\n\nGreed is a sickness, Loyalty is rare\n\nWhen you're aware of your own enemies, the playing field is fair\n\nI stare dead across that line if what I want on the other side\n\nOthers hide from the truth while I run to it blind\n\nTwo guns blazing out the days and I ain't going back\n\nMy spirit and my soul is at war, under attack\n\n\n\nThere's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\nThere's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of the boogieman (There's a monster)\n\nAnd I'm not afraid of the boogieman\n\n'Cause there's a monster inside of me\n\n\n\nI'm staring at the glare, the monster in the mirror\n\nHaving turned off all the lights for this picture to get clearer\n\nHeard a scream coming from the other room\n\nShe's on her knees, Lord, why is my son a goon?\n\nA coldness rise from his eyes, will it be summer soon?\n\nThe last warmth that I remember was in my mother's womb\n\nSo now I fumble through a cluttered tomb where my heart used to be\n\nI'm used to who I used to be\n\nThis new me is so new to me\n\nCan I prove to be, will I die in this stereotype\n\nMoving to imperial light, prevail the spiritual fight\n\nI'll be buried alive, covered by the leaves of fall\n\nMirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most savage of them all?\n\n\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\nAnd there's a monster inside of me\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of the boogieman (There's a monster)\n\nAnd I'm not afraid of the boogieman\n\n'Cause there's a monster inside of me"
