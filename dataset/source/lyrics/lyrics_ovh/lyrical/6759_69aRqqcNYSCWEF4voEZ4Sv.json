  "lyrics": "I have seen a thousand things,\r\nA thousand minds and what they bring.\r\nTo this world and to this home\r\nBut where I stand, well I don't know.\r\nI'm an open book.\n\nI'll tell you everything I know.\n\nTo the darkest corners of my mind.\n\nMy kingdom is wide,\n\nSo wide-eyed I can't track the time, between the spaces of my mind.\n\n\n\nCause I have seen a thousand things,\n\nA thousand minds and what they bring, to this world and to this home.\n\nBut where I stand, well I don't know...\n\n\n\nI have little trouble walking,\n\nIn directions I don't know of and I'm walking, and I'm walking blind.\n\n\n\nCause I have seen a thousand things,\n\nA thousand minds and what they bring, to this world and to this home.\n\nBut where I stand, well I don't know...\n\n\n\nAnd people come and people go, people I will never know, but if I did and if I could, I'd wonder when and where they stood.\n\n\n\nCause I have seen a thousand things,\n\nA thousand mind and what they bring, to this world and to this home.\n\nBut where I stand, well I don't know."
