  "lyrics": "Don't tell me I'm too hard to please\r\nThat you're worn down from fighting for me\r\nA real man knows what he's signing up for\r\nAnd if you don't then I'll show myself the door\r\nCause I'm worth it\n\nYou're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it\n\nI ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it\n\nAnd give me the love I'm deserving\n\nCause I know I'm worth it\n\nI know I'm worth it\n\n\n\nIs it too much to look me in the eye\n\nI'm so tired of being up on your shelf\n\nAnd if that's what you want\n\nYou want somebody else\n\n\n\nI'm worth it\n\nYou're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it\n\nI ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it\n\nAnd give me the love I'm deserving\n\nCause I know I'm worth it\n\nI know I'm worth it\n\n\n\nDon't tell me I'm too hard to please\n\nYou should be begging down on your knees\n\n\n\nCause I'm worth it\n\nYou're crazy baby if you think that I don't know it\n\nI ain't afraid to walk away if you can't see it, believe it\n\nAnd give me the love I'm deserving\n\nCause I know I'm worth it"
