  "title": "I Recall A Gypsy Woman",
  "lyrics": "Silver coins that jingle jangle\r\nFancy shoes that dance in time\r\nOh the secrets of her dark eyes,\r\nThey did sing a gypsy rhyme\r\nYellow clover in tangled blossoms\n\nIn a meadow silky green\n\nWhere she held me to her bosom,\n\nJust a boy of seventeen\n\n\n\nI recall a gypsy woman\n\nSilver spangles in her eyes\n\nIvory skin against the moonlight\n\nAnd the taste of life's sweet wine\n\n\n\nSoft breezes blow from fragrant meadows\n\nAnd stir the darkness in my mind\n\nOh gentle woman you sleep beside me\n\nLittle know who haunts my mind\n\nGypsy lady I hear your laughter\n\nAnd it dances in my head\n\nWhile my tender wife and babies\n\nSlumber softly in their beds\n\n\n\nI recall a gypsy woman\n\nSilver spangles in her eyes\n\nIvory skin against the moonlight\n\nAnd the taste of life's sweet wine"
