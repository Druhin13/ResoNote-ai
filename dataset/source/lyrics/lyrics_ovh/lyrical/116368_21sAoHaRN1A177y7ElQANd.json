  "lyrics": "And I don't care if we crash this party\r\nAs long as you're with me\r\nLike a fever I'm burning\r\nI'm hoping I never turns cold, yeah\r\nGot me vibing like a telephone\n\nAnd you're answering the call again\n\nTake your hands, put 'em on me\n\nGenerate the motions, love\n\n[?] below me\n\nWe move like an ocean, ooh\n\n\n\nFalling down, but it feels like flying\n\nWhat you doing to me\n\nAnd I don't care if we crash this party\n\nAs long as you're with me\n\nI know I'm falling, but it feels like flying\n\nWhat you doing to me\n\nAnd I don't care if we crash this party\n\nAs long as you're with me"
