Just tell me why\r\nYou never call\n\n\n\nBehind your symmetry lies a fundamental difference\n\nThere are those who own the mines and those who crawl\n\nNo offense but, in between the lines I'm reading\n\nYou look out for your own, and you ain't gonna look at me that way\n\n\n\nAnd it's true\n\nSo what can I do?\n\n\n\nAnything to get some of your affection\n\n(What can I do?)\n\nMaybe impress you with a song\n\n(What can I do?)\n\nI'm trying to minimize the damage done cause there ain't no one like you\n\n\n\nI found that postcard from that trip you took to Thailand\n\nI remember studying all the words written in your pretty hand\n\nThe little lines and little curves that held a sacred meaning\n\nOr so I thought, but I had it wrong\n\n\n\nNow I'm trying to figure out when it was you gave me these heartworms\n\nI feel them wriggling in my blood, you gonna do me harm\n\nRight now I'd rather lose this losing feeling that came on when you cooled off\n\nStarted treating me in this friendly way\n\n\n\nAnd it's true\n\nSo what can I do?\n\n\n\nOh won't you be still for a moment\n\n(What can I do?)\n\nSo I can push a feather through your heart\n\n(What can I do?)\n\nI'm trying to minimize damage done cause there ain't no one like you\n\n\n\nSo what can I do?\n\n\n\nWhen I get lonely to distraction\n\n(What can I do?)\n\nMaybe impress you with a song\n\n(What can I do?)\n\nNo easy way around it\n\nYou're the saddest dream that ever come true\n\n\n\nLa-la-la\n\nLa-la-la"
