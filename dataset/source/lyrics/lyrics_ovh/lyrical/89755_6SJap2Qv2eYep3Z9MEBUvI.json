  "lyrics": "I was listening to the trains\r\nI was up all night\r\nAnd something glistened in the strange\r\nBlood diffuse light\r\nMy friend was missing\r\nAnd I was ghost\n\nI was flame, I was bright\n\nI was listening to the trains\n\nI was up all night\n\n\n\nOh, James\n\nYou've got no reason to stay\n\nIn these plains\n\n\n\nI was racing against time\n\nWith this friend of mine\n\nCollapsing just before\n\nWe reached the end of the line\n\nHe was lifting diamonds straight\n\nStraight was cold, cold was black\n\nAnd black was glistening\n\nAll the night the sound remained\n\n\n\nOh, James\n\nYou've got no reason to stay\n\nIn these plains\n\nThese plains\n\nAre barren and hateful to rain\n\nAnd what remains\n\nIs the sound of trains"
