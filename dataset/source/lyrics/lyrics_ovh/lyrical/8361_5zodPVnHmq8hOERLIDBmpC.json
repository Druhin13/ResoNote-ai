  "lyrics": "I can't see another way\r\nWe're burning into feeling blue\r\nJust tell me i'm burning out\r\nI know every word is true\r\nOlder and older\n\nThe voice of wasted youth has never been so loud\n\nOver and over\n\nLike powder in the barrel pushin' deeper down\n\n\n\nGive up, swallow it all, again\n\nSwallow it all come on\n\nSwallow it all\n\n\n\nAnd now rise and now repeat\n\nWe deserve evereything we own\n\nThe long road to transience\n\nThe tightrope between our bones\n\n\n\nAll we are golden\n\nEvery other step is met with vicious eyes\n\nStrangers and lovers\n\nSugar-filled assurance in between the lies\n\n\n\nGive up, swallow it all again\n\nSwallow it all come on\n\nSwallow it all\n\n\n\nCome on, swallow it all, come on\n\nSwallow it all, give up\n\nSwallow it all again\n\nSwallow it all come on\n\nSwallow it all"
