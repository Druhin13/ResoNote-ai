  "lyrics": "There is a storm coming down\r\nBut there’s nothing to be afraid of\r\nI can hear the cries from a lonely prayer\r\nI can't see the light but I know it’s there\r\nThere is a war with no crown\n\nLike a prophet who preach to lions\n\nI can hear the cries from a world in fear\n\nI can't see the light but I know it’s there\n\n\n\nSo let them in\n\n'Cause you know we're the same, there’s no reason to feel afraid\n\nPut yourself in their place and tell me you feel no pain\n\nOh, when it all is said and done\n\nCan’t you see who holds the gun?\n\n\n\nThere is a flood coming down\n\nAnd there’s nothing to be afraid of\n\nI can feel the love from a world in prayer\n\nI can't see the light but I know it’s here\n\n\n\nSo let them in\n\n'Cause you know we're the same, there’s no reason to feel afraid\n\nPut yourself in their place and tell me you feel no pain\n\nOh, when it all is said and done\n\nCan’t you see who holds the gun?\n\n\n\nA boy\n\nA son\n\nA girl\n\nA gun\n\nWe fear\n\nWe bomb\n\nThey flee\n\nWho won?\n\nA boy, we fear\n\nA son, we bomb\n\nA girl, she flees\n\nA gun, who won?\n\n\n\nSo let them in\n\n'Cause you know we're the same, there’s no reason to feel afraid\n\nPut yourself in their place and tell me you feel no pain\n\nOh, when it all is said and done\n\nCan’t you see who holds, the gun?"
