  "lyrics": "Shining starlike\nLuminous like a ghost\nHomeward bound\nBack through the deeps and out\nTranslucent skin so pale and cold\nThis image reflects the doubt\n\nBut time itself is told\n\n\n\nIn the hollows deep and wide in the depths forever more\n\nI'll bewail you and all of those before\n\n\n\nYour place is here in all the things foretold\n\n\n\nForever remember, never to forget\n\nThose tears of quartz, perpetual\n\nChrysolite, jasper and agate\n\nBut time itself is ol\n\n\n\nIn the hollows deep and wide in the depths forever more\n\nI'll bewail you and all of those before\n\nLacrimosa\n\nSancta mater dolorosa\n\nBlack wings of death unfold\n\n\n\nReunited and returned\n\nTo the black womb of the abyss\n\nBack in time\n\nBack to the shadowy lands of old"
