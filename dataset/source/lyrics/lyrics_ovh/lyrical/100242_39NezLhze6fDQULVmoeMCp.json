  "lyrics": "A pilgrim on a pilgrimmage\r\nWalked across the Brooklyn Bridge\r\nHis sneakers torn\r\nIn the hour when the homeless move their cardboard blankets\r\nAnd the new day is born\n\nFolded in his backpack pocket\n\nThe questions that he copied from his heart\n\nWho Am I in this lonely world?\n\nWhere will I make my bed tonight?\n\nWhen twilight turns to dark\n\n\n\nQuestions for the angels...\n\nWho believes in angels?\n\nFools do...\n\nFools and pilgrims all over the world\n\n\n\nIf you shop for Love in a bargain store\n\nAnd you don't get what you are bargain for...\n\nCan you get your money back?\n\nIf an empty train in a railway station\n\nCalls you to its destination\n\nCan you choose another track?\n\n\n\nWill I wake up from these violent dreams?\n\nWith my hair as white as the morning moon?\n\n\n\nQuestions for the angels...\n\nWho believes in angels?\n\nI do...\n\nFools and pilgrims all over the world\n\n\n\nDowntown Brooklyn\n\nThe pilgrim is passing a bill-board\n\nAnd catches his eyes\n\nIt's Jay-Z\n\nHe's got a kid on each knee\n\nHe is wearing clothes that he wants us to try\n\n\n\nIf every human on the planet\n\nAnd all the buildings in it\n\nShould disappear\n\nWould a zebra grazing in the african savana\n\nCare enough to share one zebra tear?\n\n\n\nQuestions for the angels..."
