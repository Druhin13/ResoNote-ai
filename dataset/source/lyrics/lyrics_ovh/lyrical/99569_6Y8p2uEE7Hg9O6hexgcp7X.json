I don't have the patience\n\nAll my friends are with me so I should be gettin' wasted\n\nWho wants to spend all this time on pointless conversations?\n\nI don't, no\n\n\n\nI'm not coming home, now\n\nDon't wait up too long, now\n\nOut here on my own, now\n\nI'm not coming home (I'm not coming home)\n\nI'm not coming home, now\n\nDon't tell me to slow down\n\nOrder me one more round\n\n'Cause I'm not coming home\n\nI'm not coming home (yeah)\n\nI'm not coming home (yeah)\n\nI'm not coming home (yeah)\n\nI'm not coming home (yeah)\n\n\n\nI'm not coming home, now\n\nDon't wait up too long, now\n\nOut here on my own, now\n\nI'm not coming home (I'm not coming home)\n\nI'm not coming home, now\n\nDon't tell me to slow down\n\nOrder me one more round\n\n'Cause I'm not coming home\n\nI'm not coming home"
