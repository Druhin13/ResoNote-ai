  "lyrics": "Lyin' fever, a hidden moon\r\nRestless wind and a callin' loon\r\nDying fast like the highest noon\r\nWell I never learn from nothing\r\nFeather falls the river light\n\nThe warm and shaking summer night\n\nI have two friends but one is right\n\nAnd he's older now than ever\n\n\n\nRun so fast through the fields in May\n\nAnd I forgot what I had to say\n\nI've never been through a harder day\n\nThan the one that left your ghost here\n\n\n\nLife is good on the open road\n\nWe're closer now than we'll ever know\n\nThe light inside you comes and goes\n\nBut it never really goes out"
