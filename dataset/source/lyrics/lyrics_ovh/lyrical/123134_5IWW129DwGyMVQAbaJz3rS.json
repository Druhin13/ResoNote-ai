  "lyrics": "Watchin’ movies on my phone\r\nWhenever I want\r\nI turn it as loud as it goes\r\n‘Cause when nobody's home\r\nI’m the king of everything\n\nMake the rules up on my own\n\nI can break ‘em if I please\n\n‘Cause I make up the police\n\n\n\nAnd everybody's equal\n\nBut not me, ‘cause I’m the king\n\nI make all the other people\n\nTell me secrets in my dreams\n\n\n\nI wake up when they tell us to\n\nAt night, I’ll stay with you\n\nI’ll take my time\n\nTo make you smile\n\n‘Cause I know just how you feel when you’re alone\n\n\n\nAnd you don’t need me, no\n\nI’ll take all your time\n\nAnd I love the way it feels\n\nWhen you take the wheel\n\nI know\n\nYou know\n\n\n\nI will take all your time\n\nI will take all your time"
