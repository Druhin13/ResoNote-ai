  "lyrics": "How many lies would\r\nWe have to live\r\nBefore we escape the hands\r\nThe hands of time\r\nThat stole our best years\r\nWhere the decades might\n\nBreathe a little less\n\nA little less of the\n\nNight\n\n\n\nStep bravely out into\n\nThe city lights tonight\n\nSweet blood is coursing\n\nThrough our veins\n\nDarkness it pulls so tight\n\nAround us\n\nAntidotes to all\n\nOur years of pain"
