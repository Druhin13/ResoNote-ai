  "lyrics": "Heaven, I'm in heaven\r\nAnd my heart beats so that I can hardly speak\r\nAnd I seem to find the happiness I seek\r\nWhen we're out together dancing cheek to cheek\r\nHeaven, I'm in heaven\r\nAnd the cares that hung around me through the week\n\nSeem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak\n\nWhen we're out together dancing (swinging) cheek to cheek\n\nOh I love to climb a mountain\n\nAnd reach the highest peak\n\nBut it doesn't thrill (boot) me half as much\n\nAs dancing cheek to cheek\n\nOh I love to go out fishing\n\nIn a river or a creek\n\nBut I don't enjoy it half as much\n\nAs dancing cheek to cheek\n\n(Come on and) Dance with me\n\nI want my arm(s) about you\n\nThat (Those) charm(s) about you\n\nWill carry me through...\n\n(Right up) To heaven, I'm in heaven\n\nAnd my heart beats so that I can hardly speak\n\nAnd I seem to find the happiness I seek\n\nWhen we're out together dancing, out together dancing (swinging)\n\nOut together dancing cheek to cheek\n\nINSTRUMENTAL VERSION"
