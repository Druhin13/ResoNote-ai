  "lyrics": "You wrote your autograph on the far side of the sky\r\nYou recorded the falling rain but you never told us why\r\nYou painted with fire only the ashes now remain\r\nThe monochrome desire you left us too young to explain\r\nWill you lead us to an empty room\n\nAnd frame it with the sky so blue\n\nThe little boy who saw the truth\n\nHe left us with international blue\n\nInternational blue\n\n\n\nHere's my gift to you, a soundtrack to the void\n\nThe deepest of interludes, the myths that you destroyed\n\nAnd I saw that colour through a clear wide window\n\nAnd I saw that colour and I knew I had to go\n\n\n\nWill you lead us to an empty room\n\nAnd frame it with the sky so blue\n\nThe little boy who saw the truth\n\nHe left us with international blue\n\nInternational blue\n\n\n\nWill you lead us to an empty room\n\nAnd frame it with the sky so blue\n\nThe little boy who saw the truth\n\nHe left us with international blue\n\nInternational blue\n\nInternational blue\n\nInternational blue"
