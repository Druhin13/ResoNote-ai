  "lyrics": "You say all deprived a hat in your hand,\r\nI guess it proves you understand.\r\nWhat I realize I've left and you're bored,\r\nI wanna hold you close as I can.\r\nPass me anything,\n\nI don't want to feel a thing.\n\nI want you to be wanted, I want to see you home.\n\nI wanted you to always stay and not be alone.\n\n\n\nIt's your time you never want more,\n\nIt was blood-soaked and sane.\n\nSo I'm running for the answers, could ya just tell me so.\n\nI won't come back again.\n\n\n\nPass me anything,\n\nI don't want to feel a thing.\n\nI've been feeling broken and I feel like I could go\n\nHere at any moment. I'm telling you so\n\nMove me in the stream.\n\nI just want to close and dream.\n\nKnow that you were wanted. I wish you were still home,\n\nI wish you could have always stayed and not be alone.\n\n\n\nPass me anything,\n\nI don't want to feel a thing.\n\nI want you to be wanted, I want to see you home.\n\nI wanted you to always stay and not be alone.\n\nPass me anything,\n\nI don't want to feel a thing.\n\nKnow that you were wanted. I wish you were still home,\n\nI wish you could have always stayed and not be alone.\n\n\n\nAlone"
