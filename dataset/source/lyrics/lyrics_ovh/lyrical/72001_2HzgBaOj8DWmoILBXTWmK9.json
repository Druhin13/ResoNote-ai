  "lyrics": "I can't find your face in a thousand masqueraders\r\nYou're hidden in the colors of a million other lost charades\r\nIn life's big parade\r\nI'm the loneliest spectator\r\nCuz you're gone without a trace in a sea of faceless imitators\r\nI can't take another night\n\nBurning inside this\n\nHell is living without your love\n\nAin't nothing without your\n\nTouch me\n\nHeaven would be like hell\n\nIs living without you\n\nTry to walk away\n\nWhen I see the time I've wasted\n\nStarving at a feast\n\nAnd all this wine I never tasted\n\nOn my lips Your memory has been stained\n\nIt is all in vain\n\nTell me who's to blame\n\nI can't take another night\n\nBurning inside this\n\nHell is living without your love\n\nAin't nothing without your\n\nTouch me\n\nHeaven would be like hell\n\nIs living without you\n\nNights get longer and colder\n\nI'm down begging to hold ya\n\nOn my own and I feel like hell\n\nIs living without you\n\nNights get longer and colder\n\nI'm down begging to hold ya\n\nOn my own and I feel like hell\n\nIs living without you"
