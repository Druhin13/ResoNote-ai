  "lyrics": "I'll bring you the head of the demon\r\nI'm peeling the skin from his face\r\nThe life that you lead is inhuman\r\nIts cause and effects a disgrace\r\nYou're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell\n\nYour prayers and your demons are tolling the bell\n\n\n\nWalking through fire, fate's in my hands\n\nWaiting for lightning to strike\n\nMan on a wire, bearing the brand\n\nWaiting for lightning to strike\n\nLightning to strike\n\n\n\nTwisted dreams that are formed from illusion\n\nThe collusion of fear and torment\n\nDecimating to stem this contusion\n\nWith a power-mad freaking intent\n\n\n\nYou're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell\n\nYour prayers and your demons lie dead where they fell\n\n\n\nWalking through fire, fate's in my hands\n\nWaiting for lightning to strike\n\nMan on a wire, bearing the brand\n\nWaiting for lightning to strike\n\nLightning to strike\n\n\n\nI'll spin the world around reeling\n\nI have to when mankind's at stake\n\nI might be left broken and bleeding\n\nFor it's all in the fight that we make\n\n\n\nYou're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell\n\nYour prayers and your demons are tolling the bell\n\n\n\nWalking through fire, fate's in my hands\n\nWaiting for lightning to strike\n\nMan on a wire, bearing the brand\n\nWaiting for lightning to strike\n\nLightning to strike\n\n\n\nLightning will strike!"
