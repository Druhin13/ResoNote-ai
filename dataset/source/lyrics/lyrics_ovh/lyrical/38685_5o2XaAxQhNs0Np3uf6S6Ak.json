  "lyrics": "People around me, all at war with themselves\r\nThey don’t hear the sirens over their words\r\nThrowing opinions, instead of asking for help\r\nBut there is no good in shouting when you want to be heard\n\nTry A Little Kindness\n\nIt’s all we need\n\nTreat the world around you with\n\nEmpathy\n\nWhen you feel afraid\n\nAnd don’t know what to say\n\nJust try a little kindness\n\nAnd we’ll be saved\n\n\n\nTry a little kindness\n\nAnd we’ll be saved\n\n\n\nHey ya hey ya\n\nHey ya hey ya\n\n\n\nThe way that we’re talking, with anger and blame\n\nIt don’t make peace the object, it only divides\n\n\n\nKeep trying to win, like conversation’s a game\n\nBut there is no need to fight, we’re all on the same side\n\n\n\nYou gotta try a little kindness\n\nIt’s all we need\n\nTreat the world around you with\n\nEmpathy\n\nWhen you feel afraid\n\nAnd don’t know what to say\n\nJust try a little kindness\n\nAnd we’ll be saved\n\n\n\nHey ya hey ya (try a little kindness )\n\nHey ya hey ya (try a little kindness)\n\n\n\nWe all feel a pain sometimes\n\nRunning in the rain sometimes\n\nIt’d be a shame\n\nIf we wasted our days, not being kind\n\n\n\nTurn to your neighbor\n\nTell em you care\n\nCall up a friend\n\nLet em know you’re there\n\nThere ain't no time to waste\n\nThere ain't no time to waste\n\nTry a little\n\nTry a little\n\nKindness\n\n\n\nTry A Little Kindness\n\nIt’s all we need\n\nTreat the world around you with\n\nEmpathy\n\nWhen you feel afraid\n\nAnd don’t know what to say\n\nJust try a little kindness\n\nAnd we’ll be saved\n\n\n\nTry a little kindness\n\nAnd we’ll be saved"
