  "lyrics": "Get down the fiddle and break out the bow\r\nTake off the gloves and throw down the hole\r\nWorked hard all week my back is sore\r\nIt's Friday night I'm ready to roar\r\nReady to roar, ready to roar\n\nIt's five o'clock and I'm out that door\n\nI'm hot and dusty, I'm tired and wore\n\nBut it's Friday night and I'm ready to roar\n\n\n\nI've been pickin' this up and puttin' that down\n\nTired of my boss bossin' me around\n\nChangin' my clothes goin' into town\n\nFind a little love and drink a little down\n\n\n\nReady to roar, ready to roar\n\nIt's five o'clock and I'm out that door\n\nI'm hot and dusty, I'm tired and wore\n\nBut it's Friday night and I'm ready to roar\n\n\n\nWell I picked up a lid from a friend of mine\n\nAnd the man picked me up now I'm doin' time\n\nBut I'm out tomorrow and if you see my friend\n\nTell him meet me at the bar and we can try that again\n\nHe might not know me 'cause I'm low class\n\nTell him I'm the one with his head up his ass\n\n\n\nReady to roar, ready to roar\n\nIt's five o'clock and I'm out that door\n\nI'm hot and dusty, I'm tired and wore\n\nBut it's Friday night and I'm ready to roar\n\nOne more"
