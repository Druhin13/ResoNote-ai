  "lyrics": "How does it begin again?\r\nHow does it amaze?\r\nTrusting abstraction\r\nAnd it has ruined me\r\nSeems I am afraid of it\n\nAn undesired effect\n\nIt resembled weakness\n\nMistaken for a strength\n\n\n\nIt did not come\n\nOr else it never left\n\n\n\nGently turn the frame around\n\nLet the water run\n\nI keep the light on very late\n\nDon't bother anyone\n\n\n\nSomething passes over me\n\nCutting sharp and bright\n\nCaught by my attention\n\nI love the moment\n\n\n\nNone or too much\n\nIt is the same result\n\n\n\nFall asleep in your bed\n\nSleep until I'm up\n\nI just want a clear head\n\nSun on my shoulder"
