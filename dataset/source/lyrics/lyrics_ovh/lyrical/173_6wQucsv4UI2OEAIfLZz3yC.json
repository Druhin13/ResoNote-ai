  "lyrics": "Eleven more days, waiting around here in the city\r\nThinking that I'm gonna escape this fucked up feeling\r\nI got on a flight, economy class\r\nI couldn't sleep, I listened to jazz\r\nEleven more nights, staring at nothing on the phone screen\n\nFeeling alive, and hoping that you call me\n\nI tell myself rise, you hate me to try\n\nI came over here, thought you were sincere\n\nBut I guess that I was wrong\n\n\n\nI was getting nervous that I finally met that person\n\nMaybe we just moved too fast, 'cause I woke up in the moment thinking\n\nWhy'd you leave so fast? You left without your purse\n\nAnd by the time I called you back you were gone\n\n\n\nI got eleven days to go\n\nI don't got the change to change my flight home\n\nIt's 5 O'clock in Mexico, and breakfast time in Tokyo\n\nI got eleven days to go\n\nI came here for a reason but the reason's gone\n\nIt's 5 O'clock in Mexico, and breakfast time in Tokyo\n\n\n\nEleven more days feeling hungover in the morning\n\nKicking my heels, feeling unreal, retail shopping\n\nWalk in the mall, getting new kicks, I'm feeling sick\n\nTaking a sip from this iced coffee\n\n\n\nEleven more nights, losing my mind\n\nSeeing city lights, wondering how the hell to get you off my mind\n\nWondering how the hell to get you off my mind\n\n\n\nI got eleven days to go\n\nI don't got the change to change my flight home\n\nIt's 5 O'clock in Mexico, and breakfast time in Tokyo\n\nI got eleven days to go\n\nI came here for a reason but the reason's gone\n\nIt's 5 O'clock in Mexico, and breakfast time in Tokyo\n\n\n\nI gotta be out of my mind, thinking everything woulda been fine\n\nTo come across the ocean on some frequent flyer miles\n\nI know I'll be feeling alright\n\nWhen I finally get on a flight back home\n\nBut I got eleven days to go\n\n\n\nI got eleven days to go\n\nI don't got the change to change my flight home\n\nIt's 5 O'clock in Mexico, and breakfast time in Tokyo\n\nI got eleven days to go\n\nI came here for a reason but the reason's gone\n\nIt's 5 O'clock in Mexico, and breakfast time in Tokyo"
