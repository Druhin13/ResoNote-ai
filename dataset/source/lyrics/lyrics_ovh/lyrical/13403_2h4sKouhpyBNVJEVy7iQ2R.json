  "lyrics": "Black wave coming will it hit\r\nI can taste the fear yeah it's written on my lips\r\nSipping on a cold one waiting for the rinse\r\nWoke up with an omen tatted on my wrist\r\nBlack wave coming will it drop\r\nI can see the fear yeah it's written on the wall\n\nWho you gonna trust when the killer is the cop\n\nFire in my bloodstream, water in my lungs\n\n\n\nWaiting on a black wave\n\nRunning in a rat maze\n\nShaking in my own cage\n\nWhat do I believe? I believe\n\nWaiting on a black wave\n\nLiving under bad days\n\nShaking in my own cage\n\nWhat do I believe\n\nStumbling down the street I swear to god you don't wanna test me\n\n\n\nBlack wave blocking out the sun\n\nBaby when you go down ain't no coming up\n\nThought that you were safe but nobody ever was\n\nChoking on a diamond, poison in your lungs\n\nAt the end guess we're all just animals\n\nAt the end is it all just greed\n\nWhen the ocean crash down who you gonna call\n\nHold your breath, hold your breath, counting 1 2\n\n\n\nWaiting on a black wave\n\nRunning in a rat maze\n\nShaking in my own cage\n\nWhat do I believe? I believe\n\nWaiting on a black wave\n\nLiving under bad days\n\nShaking in my own cage\n\nWhat do I believe\n\nStumbling down the street I swear to god you don't wanna test me\n\n\n\nHow did a girl like me\n\nEnd up in a world so mean"
