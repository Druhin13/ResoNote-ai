  "lyrics": "Cities of Gold they always hold the promise of ruins\r\nThe fountain of youth, we run into, is just an illusion\r\nA glass is always half full, till you fill it to the top\r\nI remember when you're with me, I forget it when you're not\r\nIf life is a lesson, love is an action\n\nIf pain is a weapon, sorrow's attraction\n\nIf you got our heartbeat, you know you got me\n\nIf a house is a building, home is a feeling\n\n\n\nHere come the force, spring on a porch\n\nDon't mean a damn thing, sheets on the bed, you nothing but thread, they're always empty\n\nIf no one, to wake up to, to make lonely stop\n\n\n\nI remember when you're with me, I forget it when you're not\n\nIf life is a lesson, if love is an action\n\nIf pain is a weapon, sorrow's attraction\n\nIf you got our heartbeat, you know you got me\n\nIf a house is a building, home is a feeling\n\n\n\nWhoooah, stay calm and light, It's just you and I\n\nWhen I realise\n\nIf life is a lesson, if love is an action\n\nIf pain is a weapon, you're my attraction\n\nIf you got our heartbeat, you know you got me\n\nIf a house is a building, home is a feeling\n\nIf a house is a building, home is a feeling"
