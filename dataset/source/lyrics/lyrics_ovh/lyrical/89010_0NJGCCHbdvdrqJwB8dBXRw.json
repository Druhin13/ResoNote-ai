  "lyrics": "You keep saying that you're alright\r\nBut I can see it through your fake smile, you know\r\nThere's a reservoir in your eyes\r\nThat you've been holding back a long time, what's wrong?\r\nDarling you don't have to hold it\n\nYou don't have to be afraid\n\nYou can go ahead and unload it\n\n'Cause you know it'll be okay\n\nFire away\n\nFire away\n\n\n\nHold me close but at a distance\n\nThinking I don't ever listen, but I do\n\nI know sometimes it get confusing\n\nYou might be lost but I ain't losing you\n\n\n\nDarling you don't have to hold it\n\nYou don't have to be afraid\n\nYou can go ahead and unload it\n\n'Cause you know it'll be okay\n\nFire away, hmm\n\nFire away\n\nFire away\n\nFire away\n\n\n\nAnd I will steady your hand\n\nWhen you're losing your grip\n\nEven if I don't understand\n\nYou can talk to me\n\nAnd I will steady your hand\n\nWhen you're losing your grip\n\nAnd even if I don't understand\n\nYou can talk to me\n\nFire away\n\nFire away\n\n\n\nFire away\n\nFire away\n\nFire away"
