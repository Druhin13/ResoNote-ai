  "lyrics": "Woke up\r\nHopped out of bed\r\nDidn't recognize who was in my head\r\nThought I had lost my mind\r\nThe smallest of difference\r\nI could tell over time\n\nHe likes all the same things\n\nBut he wants to die\n\nOr live in the rain\n\nDo you think I'm crazy?\n\nDo you think I'm paranoid?\n\nDo you think I would make this up talk some noise?\n\n\n\nWent out\n\nLooked for a smoke\n\nKind of confused\n\nHe told me too where to go\n\nJumped out in front of car\n\nBut I was too fast\n\nHe didn't get very far\n\nI cried, 'Why do I hurt?'\n\nI realize it was me\n\nJust was in a different shirt\n\nYeah I know I'm crazy\n\nYeah I know I'm paranoid\n\nBut I wouldn't make this up\n\nTo talk some noise"
