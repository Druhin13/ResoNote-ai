  "lyrics": "I'm in my feelings for you right now boy\r\nI really hate it\r\nI let you in my heart, but not by choice\r\nWhen I try to run away I\r\nI looked away the moment we locked eyes\r\nWas scared you'd see me\n\nIt always feels like you can read my mind\n\nWhen I try to run away I\n\n\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nWhen I try to run away, I\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\n\n\nI wish you didn't make me tell these lies\n\nYou know my secrets\n\nYou got my trapped I'm in so deep this time\n\nWhen I try to run away I\n\nAnd everybody knows it\n\nI was that I was invisible but\n\nI'm out in the open\n\nHate that I'm falling for you\n\nHate that I pick up my phone every time that you're calling\n\nI'm blue\n\n\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nWhen I try to run away, I\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\n\n\nI can't escape you\n\nI know\n\nAnd that makes me hate you\n\nOh no\n\nWish I didn't need you\n\nOh no\n\nBut every time I turn around I\n\n\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nWhen I try to run away, I\n\nI keep on running back to you\n\nI keep on running back to you"
