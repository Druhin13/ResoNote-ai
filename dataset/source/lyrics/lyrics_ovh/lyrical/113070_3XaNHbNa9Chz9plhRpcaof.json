the pants-sagger put plans in action\n\n'Til they claim the Pan-African made it happen\n\n\n\nYour love and your heart\n\nSee 'cause you've never been the same anyone else\n\nDon't think the same as everyone else\n\nYour love and your heart\n\nSee you'll never conclude with anyone else\n\nDon't think the same as everyone else\n\n\n\nIf I had everything, everything\n\nI could change anything\n\nIf I changed anything, I mean anything\n\nI would change everything, oh yeah\n\n\n\nDark boy, don't you cry, there's too much life left in those eyes\n\nDon't you let that face go waterfall\n\nUntil they learn to love you, scars and all\n\nDark boy, don't you die\n\nThey're just human, let them lie\n\nYou just know your world and speak your truth\n\nAnd let them come to you\n\nFor your love and your heart\n\nSee 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else\n\nDon't think the same as everyone else\n\nThis is your call, there are no wrongs\n\nSee you'll never conclude with anyone else\n\nDon't think the same as everyone else"
