  "lyrics": "I'm sick to death of eating breakfast on my own\r\nStarting out my daily blues\r\nI'm sick to death of spilling coffee on my phone\r\nScrolling through pictures of you\r\nI'd like to say that maybe we could work it out\r\nBut I know that it's no use\n\n\n\nIf I ever find anyone half as good as you\n\nI think maybe that will do\n\n\n\nI kissed a stranger in the hallway late last night\n\nHe was wearing purple shoes\n\nI asked him when he'd kiss me, could he close his eyes?\n\nBut he just looked at me confused\n\nAnd people say my expectations are too high\n\nBut I'm not asking for the moon\n\n\n\nIf I ever find anyone half as good as you\n\nI think maybe that will do\n\nIf I ever find anyone half as good as you\n\nI think maybe that will do\n\n\n\nOh, I'm so sick of laying here\n\nSo sick of counting tears\n\nComparing everyone to you\n\nOh, oh\n\nOh, I'm so sick of waiting here\n\nSo frustrated\n\nMy suspicions are you're laying there and thinking of me too\n\n\n\nI learned the lyrics yesterday to all your songs\n\nBut there was one I couldn't do\n\nI think the lyric with\n\n\"You'll miss me when I'm gone\"\n\nBut the chords, I was confused\n\nI'd ask you out and you can tell me where I'm wrong\n\nBut then I know you'd just refuse\n\n\n\nIf I ever find anyone half as good as you\n\nI think maybe that will do\n\nIf I ever find anyone half as good as you\n\nI think maybe that will do"
