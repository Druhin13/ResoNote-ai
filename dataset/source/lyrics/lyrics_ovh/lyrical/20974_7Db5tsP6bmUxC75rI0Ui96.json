  "lyrics": "I woke upon a Sunday morning\r\nTired eyes to great the day\r\nA rucksack full of expectations\r\nUp on dreary Langton Way\r\nThe train awaiting on the platform\r\nThe diesel humming high\n\nA one way ticket stamped for freedom\n\nTime for just one last goodbye\n\n\n\nToora loora lay\n\nI'm on my way\n\nMake it New York City, San Francisco, Botany Bay\n\nI've been praying I've been waiting mister\n\nFor this faithful day\n\nToora loora lay\n\n\n\nTook passage on the early water\n\nWaved the mainland sweet goodbye\n\nLit a cigarette above on top deck'\n\nWatched the seagulls soar the sky\n\nI woke up to the sound of laughter\n\nAnd the strangers passing by\n\nStepped upon the land of dreams\n\nAnd had myself a smile\n\n\n\nToora loora lay\n\nI'm on my way\n\nMake it New York City, San Francisco, Botany Bay\n\nI've been praying I've been waiting mister\n\nFor this faithful day\n\nToora loora lay\n\n\n\nMet a sham from Blarney, ginger red\n\nOn a New York City street\n\nHe was asking if I'd seen the hurling\n\nAnd how the hell we'd meet\n\nAt a bar in Queens\n\nHe knew a man that came from my hometown\n\nThen he borrowed twenty dollars\n\nTill his pay day came around\n\n\n\nToora loora lay\n\nI'm on my way\n\nMake it New York City, San Francisco, Botany Bay\n\nI've been praying I've been waiting mister\n\nFor this faithful day\n\nToora loora lay\n\n\n\nI got some work by Sydney Harbour\n\nWith a firm from Antrim town\n\nWe were digging up the paving stones\n\nLaying concrete piping down\n\nFound a place up on the hill for pints\n\nWhere they said you'd have to craic\n\nThey were singing toora loora lay\n\nSaying we're never going back\n\n\n\nToora loora lay\n\nI'm on my way\n\nMake it New York City, San Francisco, Botany Bay\n\nI've been praying I've been waiting mister\n\nFor this faithful day\n\nToora loora lay\n\n\n\nToora loora lay\n\nI'm on my way\n\nMake it New York City, San Francisco, Botany Bay\n\nI've been praying I've been waiting mister\n\nFor this faithful day\n\nToora loora lay"
