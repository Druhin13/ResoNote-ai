  "lyrics": "Aye\r\nDon't ask me about my love life\r\n(Hol' up!)\r\nIt’s complicated to find a lady in my generation\r\nThat’s not preoccupied with social clout\n\nWe almost fazing out from the high we get from love and conversation to go on IG galavanting for likes and shit\n\nOh, it’s complicated\n\nI’m tryna say I need loyalty like Clyde Barrow was tryna get when Bonnie was shot up riding shotgun with him\n\nMy problems are justified but, I gotta admit\n\nI got someone who loves me so effortless\n\nBut, I’m so messed up from another chick I feel like such a bitch ass nigga\n\nThat my exes got the power with no effort to decline the next shawty I get\n\nSo, I’m guarded and shit\n\nBut, never mind that cause you're a goddess and shit\n\nWhat I’m tryna say is I like you but it’s complicated\n\nFoundation on all my pillows, still your tender face is flawless when the sky kiss you\n\nShould I bury you in compliments or buy gifts or\n\nJust let you tell me bye and for that time I’ll miss you\n\nMy life is fairly complicated\n\nYou show too much of your heart I promise they confiscate it\n\nI am young, black, and accomplished baby but\n\nI’m not the type to bring home to mama\n\nI’m just crazy cause I’m broad crazy\n\nMonogamy’s kind of hard for me\n\nWhen I start throwing them curves that’s when they caught feelings\n\nI got famous at a young age I’m spoiled\n\nI get paid, don’t go out so the club scene I’m bored of\n\nI don’t believe in unicorns nor pure love, but more so the latter, seen Porzingis from courtside\n\nI got missed calls from porn stars and church girls\n\nYou’d be surprised who get the wildest and squirt more\n\n\n\nLet’s be honest shawty\n\nI got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty\n\nDon’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway\n\n'Cause, if I really like you I don’t like your pictures, dig it?\n\n\n\nI believe that love is complicated at best\n\nAnd at it’s worst it’s a permanent burning in your chest\n\nI pray to earn that from somebody someday\n\nBut, somehow someway I no longer have a heart to invest, it’s miles away\n\nThe smiles is fake and my job ain’t real\n\nWhy would you think I’ll find a woman who is?\n\nI’m high today\n\nTomorrow I’m chill cause my job get real\n\nWhat mature woman would put up with my shit?\n\nI mean I’m damaged goods\n\nI mean, I’m rather good at being just kind of good to women who deserve more from me\n\nBut, I see you as something more than a purring kitty\n\nYou hate my state of mind, somehow you think the world of me\n\n\n\nIt’s complicated\n\nIt’s complicated\n\nIt’s complicated\n\nIt’s complicated\n\nJust be honest shawty\n\nI got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty\n\nDon’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway\n\nCause if I really like you I won’t... fuck it\n\nBlock all them bitches, cause it’s complicated"
