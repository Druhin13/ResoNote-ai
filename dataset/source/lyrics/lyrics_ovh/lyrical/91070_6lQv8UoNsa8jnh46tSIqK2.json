  "lyrics": "Bury the hatchet now\r\nA fire's burning inside me\r\nAnd the flames continue to grow\r\nThe rage is intensifying inside me\r\nI'm spinning outta control\n\n\n\nI know this is madness, but I can't get over it\n\nI'm choking on a bitter pill, I can't seem to swallow it\n\n\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nForgive and forget, or we all end up alone\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nBefore it cuts deeper and deeper\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\n\n\nThe Devil whispers in my ears\n\n\"Revenge will show you the way\"\n\nHe plays a silent song\n\nI can't let that be my fate\n\n\n\nI know this is madness, but I can't get over it\n\nI'm choking on a bitter pill, I can't seem to swallow it\n\n\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nForgive and forget, or we all end up alone\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nBefore it cuts deeper and deeper\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\n\n\nI breathe in nothing but ashes\n\nMy heart has turned to coal\n\nIgnite my soul, let me go\n\nI breathe in nothing but ashes\n\nWhy can't you just let me go?\n\n\n\n(Why can't you just let me go?\n\nLet me go)\n\n\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nForgive and forget, or we all end up alone\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nBefore it cuts deeper and deeper\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nForgive and forget, or we all end up alone\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\nBefore it cuts deeper and deeper\n\nBury the hatchet now\n\n\n\nI breathe in nothing but ashes\n\nIgnite my soul"
