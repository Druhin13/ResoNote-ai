  "lyrics": "Maybe I've been down too long?\r\nMaybe I've been stuck inside the letters\r\nAll the story that I got on\r\nIn my head, in my head\r\nI was caught inside, internalized\n\nTill I fell into you, you, you\n\n\n\nI tried to hide away inside the darkest place\n\nWhere you keep taking me higher, higher\n\nI still do hesitate right where the light escapes\n\nWhere you keep taking me higher, higher\n\n\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nY-You keep taking me higher\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nYou keep taking me higher\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nY-You keep taking me higher\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nYou keep taking me higher\n\n\n\nLike I never even felt the high\n\nIn my head, in my head\n\n\n\nI was caught inside, internalized\n\nTill I fell into you, you, you\n\n\n\nI tried to hide away inside the darkest place\n\nWhere you keep taking me higher, higher\n\nI still do hesitate right where the light escapes\n\nWhere you keep taking me higher, higher\n\n\n\nPulling me up, up, up\n\nUp, up, up\n\nUp, up, up\n\nPulling me up, up, up\n\nUp, up, up\n\nUp, up, up\n\n\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nY-You keep taking me higher\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nYou keep taking me higher\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nY-You keep taking me higher\n\nYou keep taking me\n\nYou keep taking me higher"
