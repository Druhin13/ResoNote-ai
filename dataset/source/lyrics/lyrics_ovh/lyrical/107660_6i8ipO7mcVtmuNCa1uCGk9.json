  "lyrics": "No name for people to call small or colonize optimism\r\nNo name for inmate registries that they put me in prison\r\nI sewed the answers in linen, dance 'em under the thread\r\nPretend I'm riding in your cities when niggas scared of the feds\r\nThere's a ghost on my bike, city lay with a bullet\r\nHe wrote the scriptures for living in all the ways that he couldn't\n\nGave up the profit for pennies, no taste in mystery pudding\n\nWhen labels ask me to sign, so my name don't exist, so many names don't exist\n\nWelcome to Inglewood and the trauma came with the rent\n\nOnly worldly possession I have is life, only room that I died in was 25\n\nWhat's an eye for an eye when niggas won't love you back?\n\nAnd medicine's overtaxed, no name look like you\n\nNo name for private corporations to send emails to\n\n'Cause when we walk into heaven, nobody's name gon' exist\n\nJust boundless movement for joy, nakedness radiates\n\n\n\nYou are the joy in all the pain\n\nDon't forget from where you came\n\n[?] remembers you\n\nYour song, your truth, your light is proof\n\nAnd love is still here too\n\n\n\nDon't let it pass you by\n\nDon't let it pass you by\n\nYour life, you life, is your life, baby\n\nDon't let it pass you by\n\nDon't let it pass you by"
