  "lyrics": "Above, below\r\nUnder a lonely star\r\nHead to toe, hand in hand\r\nIt gets a whole lot better\r\nIf your telephone rings at night\n\nWould you put some time aside\n\nTo shut your eyes and fall apart\n\nUnder the light of a lonely star\n\nMy one and only lonely star\n\n\n\nAbove, below\n\nUnder a lonely star\n\nAnother day to sit around and dream\n\nAs far as I can see\n\nAs long as memory\n\nI'll be watching from afar\n\nUnder the light of a lonely star\n\nMy one and only lonely star\n\n\n\nFire burning\n\nClean-cut flowers in the yard\n\nDaylight turning\n\nAll the sleeping statues into girls\n\nI feel nothing\n\nSleep is never coming\n\nI hear laughter from afar\n\nMust be the song of a lonely star\n\n\n\nIf you knew what would happen\n\nThen you'd never set foot in the mansion door\n\nSo many voices singing all of your praises\n\nIt gets a whole lot better\n\nIt gets a whole lot better\n\nI hope it gets a whole lot better\n\n\n\nIf you leave, please don't go far\n\nI need the light of a lonely star\n\nMy one and only lonely star\n\nMy one and only lonely star"
