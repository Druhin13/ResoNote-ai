  "lyrics": "My love has come along\r\nMy dreams become air so\r\nMy days have arrived, yea sunny\r\nFunny why all so blue\r\nThe man is like a drug\n\nIn the late night when I can't get enough\n\nLove in all its splendor\n\nSurrender its every blow\n\n\n\nWhere is the blues that I know?\n\n\n\nThis is love, what was I thinking?\n\nThis is love, what the hell am I, am I gonna do?\n\nAnd that man, he got me sinking\n\nTo the bottom of the blue\n\n\n\nIt's what I choose\n\nLove is the baddest blues\n\n\n\nThe joy versus the kind\n\nNo, my joy, it ain't the same\n\nSo I put it plain and simple\n\nJust like front page news\n\n\n\nLove is the baddest blues\n\nLove is the baddest blues\n\n\n\nThis is love, what was I thinking?\n\nThis is love, what the hell am I, am I gonna do?\n\nAnd that man, he got me sinking\n\nTo the bottom of the blue\n\n\n\nGuess that I, I'll lose\n\nLove is the baddest blues"
