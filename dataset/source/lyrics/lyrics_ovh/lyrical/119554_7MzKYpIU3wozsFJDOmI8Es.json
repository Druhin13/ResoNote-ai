  "lyrics": "Mary Anne the matriarch is stirring in the dark\r\nShe knows just what to do with time but I don't know where to start\r\nCause in the daylight there are monsters in my closet\r\nUsing up the wifi\r\nHope she never knows whats on my mind\r\nOn my only time\n\nCause that feels right\n\n\n\nAs I move everywhere\n\nYes, I move everywhere\n\nInside\n\n\n\nEvery phone call i'm pacing the halls\n\nAm I the only one that sleeps with the tv on?\n\nAnd our good feels better than our hanging on\n\nWhen I need time alone\n\n\n\nSo I pinched a tale where the white things crawl\n\nTo feel the earth beneath me\n\nTry to avoid the pollution from this revolution\n\nTry to see the dust on the stars\n\nBabe, I move everywhere\n\nYes, I move everywhere\n\nInside us\n\n\n\nThey say i'm a wreck, i'm a wreck\n\nI'm your wreck like, i'm your wreck like\n\nIm a wreck, i'm a wreck\n\nBut i'm your wreck like, i'm your wreck like\n\n\n\nLife's a bitch I swallow\n\nNo teeth, no hands\n\nLife's a bitch I swallowed\n\nNo tears, no plans\n\n\n\nWhatever happens there's money in the mattress\n\nAnd whatever happens please remember all the laughter\n\nStitch it together kid, I know you know better\n\nTake a real deep breath and i'll burn the letter\n\nThis is headlights in the fog\n\nThis is headlights in the fog\n\n\n\nCome meet me in San Francisco\n\nCome over this far love\n\nCause when we are together it's that slip off your shoes\n\nBut when you take forever\n\nI know time will slow but I wanna know\n\nYou will remember that I put my soul into it all"
