  "lyrics": "You only come up in my head when I'm uncomfortable\r\nI tell myself everyday, I don't need you at all\r\nYou seem to change my stance on breathing everyday\r\nLife, My happiness ain't enough for me to stay\r\nI wish I didn't have half as much to do with you\n\nBut then again who would I be without the shit I do?\n\nThey always want me, she is her mother's daughter\n\nI grab the edge of the pool, but it's made of water\n\n\n\nI know it's over now\n\nCan't leave it alone\n\nI know it's gone for now\n\nFeeling more alone\n\n\n\nI know it's over now\n\nCan't leave it alone\n\nI know it's gone for now\n\nFeeling more alone\n\n\n\nI can't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep getting you out\n\n\n\nI heard you're still living in that same house\n\nI thought for sure you would be living elsewhere by now\n\nI bet the keys are hidden temporarily\n\nThey're getting used by someone constantly, different to me\n\n\n\nI know it's over now\n\nCan't leave it alone\n\nI know it's gone for now\n\nFeeling more alone\n\n\n\nI know it's over now\n\nCan't leave it alone\n\nI know it's gone for now\n\nFeeling more alone\n\n\n\nI can't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out (I know it's over now)\n\nCan't keep running out (Can't leave it alone)\n\nCan't keep running out (I know it's gone for now)\n\nCan't keep running out (Feeling more alone)\n\nCan't keep running out (I know it's over now)\n\nCan't keep running out (Can't leave it alone)\n\nCan't keep running out (I know it's gone for now)\n\nCan't keep running out (Feeling more alone)\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep running out\n\nCan't keep getting you out"
