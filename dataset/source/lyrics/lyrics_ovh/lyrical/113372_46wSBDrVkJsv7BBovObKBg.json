  "lyrics": "Morningside\r\nThe old man died\r\nAnd no one cried\r\nThey simply turned away\r\nAnd when he died\n\nHe left a table made of nails and pride\n\nAnd with his hands,\n\nHe carved these words inside\n\n'For my children'\n\n\n\nMorning light\n\nMorning bright\n\nI spent the night\n\nWith dreams that make you weep\n\nMorning time\n\nWash away the sadness\n\nFrom these eyes of mine\n\nFor I recall the words an old man signed\n\n'For my children'\n\n\n\n[Spoken:]\n\nAnd the legs were shaped with his hands\n\nAnd the top made of oaken wood\n\nAnd the children\n\nThat sat around this great table\n\nTouched it with their laughter\n\nAh, and that was good\n\n\n\nMorningside\n\nAn old man died\n\nAnd no one cried\n\nHe surely died alone\n\nAnd truth is sad\n\nFor not a child would claim the gift he had\n\nThe words he carved became his epitaph\n\n'For my children'"
