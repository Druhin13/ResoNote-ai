  "lyrics": "Tonight I'm gonna sit with you\r\nWhile all of the lines are blurring\r\nTonight I'm gonna fit with you\r\nWhile the L.A. skies are burning\r\nWhen I get afraid I shut down\r\nLook for a way to run around the truth\n\nBut baby tonight I wanna be with you\n\nShow you a side you never knew\n\n\n\nPut your eyes on that deeper love\n\nBut you can't be scared of the dark\n\nGotta wait up long enough\n\n\n\n'Cause you'll only really see me when the Sun goes down\n\nYou'll only really know me when I fall apart\n\nTonight we're gonna lie under the black sky, black sky\n\nWaiting for the moment 'til the stars come out\n\nTil' the stars come out\n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\n\n\nTonight I've got my eyes on you\n\nI'm seeing the constellations\n\nWhen I get afraid I shut down\n\nLook for a way to run around the truth\n\nBut baby tonight I'm made of gold for you\n\nUnder the light of the silver half-moon\n\n\n\n'Cause you'll only really see me when the Sun goes down\n\nYou'll only really know me when I fall apart\n\nTonight we're gonna lie under the black sky, black sky\n\nWaiting for the moment 'til the stars come out\n\nTil' the stars come out\n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out \n\nTil' the stars come out"
