  "lyrics": "Are you buried alive?\r\nI know you're rotting inside and no one knows you're hurting\r\nYou're searching for light, but all you know is burning\r\nCan't find the cure for something no one can see\r\nCan't find the answers when there's no room left to breath\n\n\n\nTrapped in. The darkness swallowing\n\nDesperate to feel yourself again\n\nToo late. I see no hope in your eyes\n\nAre you buried alive?\n\n\n\nI can't stop, my path is set\n\nAll I know is violence\n\n\n\nI know you're rotting inside and no one knows you're hurting\n\nYou're searching for light, but all you know is burning\n\nCan't find the cure for something no one can see\n\nCan't find the answers when there's no room left to breath\n\n\n\nTrapped in. The darkness swallowing\n\nDesperate to feel yourself again\n\nToo late. I see no hope in your eyes\n\nAre you buried alive?\n\n\n\nI'm a liar, deceiver; it dwells inside\n\nI'm a cynic, I'm desperate to find out why\n\nAll the whispers of every last demon inside; if I listen to them, they will take my life\n\n\n\nSilence!\n\n\n\nCan't find the cure for something no one can see\n\nIt won't stop"
