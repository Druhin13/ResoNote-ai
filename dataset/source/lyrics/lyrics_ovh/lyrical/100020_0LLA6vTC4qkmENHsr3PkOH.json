  "lyrics": "While you’re watching from the window waiting\r\nI’ve been spilling my guts out on the stage\r\nI spent the best years of my life\r\nDrinking myself to sleep at night\r\nAnd now the glory days have all but faded\r\nEveryone I used to know is jaded\n\nWhere is the passion that you used to have\n\nWhen music was the only thing that you had?\n\n\n\nAll my pictures have faded over time\n\nI burnt the negatives of you\n\nWhat have I got here left to prove?\n\nCause all I got, all I really got is this music that’s left in me\n\nAnd all I want, all I really want is a reason to believe\n\n\n\nSome day I know that I’ll be fading\n\nEveryone I used to know is getting afraid, afraid, afraid of getting older\n\nAnd every heart I love grows colder\n\nI love when time slips by\n\nI’m not afraid to die\n\nRemember the passion that you used to have\n\nWhen music was the only thing that you had\n\nThis still is the only thing that, that is worth my breath\n\nThis still is the only thing that, that is worth my breath\n\n\n\nAll my pictures have faded over time\n\nI burnt the negatives of you\n\nWhat have I got here left to prove?\n\nCause all I got, all I really got is this music that’s left in me\n\nAnd all I want, all I really want is a reason to believe\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying so hard to make the best of my time\n\nInstead of waiting around hoping that someday I’ll find\n\nAll the things that I need and all the love that I get\n\nWasted till all the days become numb again\n\n\n\nAll my pictures have faded over time\n\nI burnt the negatives of you\n\nAll my pictures have faded over time\n\nI burnt the negatives of you\n\nWhat have I got here left to prove?\n\nAll I got, all I really got is this music that’s left in me\n\nAnd all I want all I really want is a reason to believe"
