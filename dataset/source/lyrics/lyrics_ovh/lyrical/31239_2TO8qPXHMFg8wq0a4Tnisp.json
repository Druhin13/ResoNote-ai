  "lyrics": "Watching every motion\r\nIn my foolish lover's game\r\nOn this endless ocean\r\nFinally lovers know no shame\r\nTurning and returning\n\nTo some secret place inside\n\nWatching in slow motion\n\nAs you turn around and say\n\n\n\nTake my breath away\n\n\n\nWatching I keep waiting\n\nStill anticipating love\n\nNever hesitating\n\nTo become that fated ones\n\n\n\nTurning and returning\n\nTo some secret place to hide\n\nWatching in slow motion\n\nAs you turn to me and say, my love\n\n\n\nTake my breath away, mhm\n\nTake my breath away\n\n\n\nWatching every motion\n\nIn my foolish lover's game\n\nHunted by the notion\n\nSomewhere, there's a love in flames\n\n\n\nTurning and returning\n\nTo some secret place inside\n\nWatching in slow motion\n\nAs you turn my way and say, my love\n\n\n\nTake my breath away\n\nWould you take my breath away?\n\n\n\nThrough the hourglass I saw you\n\nIn time you slipped away\n\nWhen the mirror crashed, I called you\n\nAnd turned to hear you say\n\n\n\nIf only for today\n\nI am unafraid\n\n\n\nTake my breath away, oh, oh, oh\n\nTake my breath away\n\nTake my breath away\n\n\n\nOh-oh\n\nOh-oh\n\nOh-oh"
