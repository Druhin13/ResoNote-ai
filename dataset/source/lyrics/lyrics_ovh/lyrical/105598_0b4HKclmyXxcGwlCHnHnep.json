  "lyrics": "Pressure on the clay\r\nCarving out opinions\r\nWhisper that I'm winning\r\nForce it every day\r\nHide away from nothing\r\nScreaming out for something\n\n\n\nDon't know how to fool you no more\n\nMiss the point in the clear view, I'm shy\n\nMaybe we should argue until we find a meaning\n\nBack to the beginning, back to before\n\n\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\n\n\nDid my best to stay\n\nUnder your affection\n\nCursing my reflection\n\nI know winds are gonna change\n\nAnd you bury your engine\n\nEvery single day\n\n\n\nDon't know how to fool you no more\n\nMiss the point in the clear view, I'm shy\n\nMaybe we should argue until we find a meaning\n\nBack to the beginning, back to before\n\n\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\n\n\nYou're in my head, I wish I could forget ya\n\nEverything you've said\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nBurning cigarettes, trying to forget you\n\nTwisting words I said\n\nBut you can have it all\n\n\n\nYou're in my head, I wish I could forget ya\n\nEverything you've said\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nBurning cigarettes, trying to forget you\n\nTwisting words I said\n\n\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\nBut you can have it all\n\nYou can have it all\n\nYou can have it all"
