  "lyrics": "(One, two)\r\nThere's a cactus fly where somewhere out there\r\nKnows my deepest thoughts\r\nThere's a tumbleweed inside of me that's never gonna stop\r\nThere's a mountain out there somewhere I still haven't climbed\n\nYou know I love you baby, I just need a little time\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm a son, of the sun\n\nA brother to the sky\n\nSometimes I gotta lose myself so I don't lose my mind\n\nI get some dust on my boots\n\nFound some truth in the blue\n\nLet the desert air burn inside my lungs\n\n'Cause baby I'm a son of the sun\n\n\n\nI wanna look down on a valley\n\nQhere the river splits the stone\n\nLet the great wide open\n\nOpen wide my soul\n\nI could never live without you\n\nI always come back to you\n\nBut sometimes I need to catch the wind\n\nAnd go howl at the wind\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm a son, of the sun\n\nA brother to the sky\n\nSometimes I gotta lose myself so I don't lose my mind\n\nI get some dust on my boots\n\nFound some truth in the blue\n\nLet the desert air burn inside my lungs\n\n'Cause baby I'm a son of the sun\n\nI'm a son, of the sun\n\nA brother to the sky\n\nSometimes I gotta lose myself so I don't lose my mind\n\nI get some dust on my boots\n\nFound some truth in the blue\n\nLet the desert air burn inside my lungs\n\n'Cause baby I'm a son of the sun"
