Thats what they are when we come around\n\n(Yeah!) this is your town and we run it now\n\n(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hunnit thou?\n\n(Yeah!) if you want the rain then we comin' down\n\n\n\nI stamp that we cool\n\nI'm awesome, kickflip in the Carsons\n\nWe should run for the pool\n\nI got the fire flow, the department exhausted\n\nI owe nothing to you\n\nI'm in the Tahoe, man you making me nauseous\n\nPullin up with the crew\n\nYou such a hypebeast, man you making me vomit\n\nLook\n\n\n\nWatch me, watch me\n\nWatch me, do this\n\nIts always been more than the music\n\nYou riding waves in the back of my cruise ship\n\nLook, Watch me, watch me\n\nWatch me, do this\n\nSince 2012 I've been the coolest\n\nIf you do not get it my nigga you foolish\n\n\n\n(Yeah!) Thats what they are when we come around\n\n(Yeah!) this is your town and we run it now\n\n(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hunnit thou?\n\n(Yeah!) if you want the rain then we comin' down\n\n\n\nLook, look, look\n\nThis shit is out of here\n\nYou got the heat I was not aware\n\nMe and Bebe out in Rodderdam\n\nGot a new man, damn now I see him\n\nHe on the floor, in my coliseum\n\nI hope to god he don't sign a prenup\n\nSee my ex on the street like I never seen her!\n\n\n\nWatch me, watch me\n\nWatch me, do this\n\nYou see me dancing like I'm Elvis\n\nJust tell your man that it's all in the pelvis\n\nWatch me, watch me\n\nWatch me, do this\n\nSince 2012 I've been the coolest\n\nIf you do not get it my nigga you foolish\n\n\n\n(Yeah!) Thats what they are when we come around\n\n(Yeah!) this is your town and we run it now\n\n(Yeah!) How big is your army, a hunnit thou?\n\n(Yeah!) if you want the rain then we comin' down"
