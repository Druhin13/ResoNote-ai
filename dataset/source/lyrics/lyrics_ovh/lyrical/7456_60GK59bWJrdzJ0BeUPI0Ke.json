  "lyrics": "She hates how much it rains\r\nBut it’s rainin’ all the time\r\nShe said, “I’d like to go home, I don’t feel right in these clothes, and I might be losing my mind.”\r\nShe said, “I’m always goin ‘round, round and round in my head…\r\nI don’t want to sleep alone, we ain’t kids anymore, but the kids are alright, yeah.”\n\n\n\nAnd I’ve been at her majesty’s pleasure\n\nBut I still haven’t found a way to survive\n\nAnd you say\n\n\n\n“Don’t you understand, I know what it’s like to be a rolling stone?”\n\nHaunted with heartbroken ghosts, and Elsie singin’ “how does it feel?”\n\nBut oh, my Lily, if you only knew, I only want to be haunted by you\n\nAnd I would crawl across the grass to bow at your feet in the service of the queen\n\n\n\nShe said, “I want to find a heart that breaks the same as mine\n\nI’m much too young to stay feeling old in my frame sipping drinks about the good days.”\n\n\n\nAnd I’ve been at her majesty’s pleasure\n\nBut I still haven’t found a way to survive\n\nAnd you say\n\n\n\n“Don’t you understand, I know what it’s like to be a rolling stone?”\n\nHaunted with heartbreaking ghosts, and Elsie singin’ “how does it feel?”\n\nBut oh, my Lily, if you only knew, I only want to be haunted by you\n\nAnd I would crawl across the grass to bow at your feet in the service of the queen\n\n\n\nI’m always starting all over\n\nI don’t want to waste the nights in my life\n\nBut I never fit in, or felt home in my skin\n\nI’m waiting on a big love, baby\n\nI’m waiting on a big love, baby\n\nI’m waiting on a big love, baby\n\nI’m waiting on a big love, baby\n\n\n\nAnd don’t you understand, I know what it’s like to be a rolling stone?\n\nHaunted with heartbreaking ghosts, and you got Elsie singin’ “how does it feel?”\n\nBut oh, my Lily, if you only knew! I only want to be haunted by you\n\nAnd I would crawl across the grass to bow at your feet in the service of the queen\n\n(I’m waiting on a big bomb, baby, I’m waiting on a big bomb, baby)\n\nIn the service of the queen\n\n(I’m waiting on a big bomb, baby, I’m waiting on a big bomb, baby)\n\nIn the service of the queen"
