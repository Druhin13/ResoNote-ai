  "lyrics": "Who mocks the infidel's faith\r\nMocked by haze and hate\r\nForever score doubt of doubt\r\nFlame the torch to burn you out\r\nStanding tall to messenger's death\n\nNo reward from angel's breath\n\nTown is full without a sound\n\nBlinds the knife across the crown\n\n\n\nAnd the gambler in the state\n\nLooking for the nation's fate\n\nI'm alone and all the time\n\nBelow not know what's mine"
