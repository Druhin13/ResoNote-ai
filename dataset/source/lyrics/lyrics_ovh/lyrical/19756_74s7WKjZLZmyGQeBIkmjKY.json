  "lyrics": "Featuring William Hart of the Delfonics\r\n(Verse 1: Ghostface Killah)\r\nI formed a crew, niggas straight tell me I'm slippin'\r\nI'm the boss of the fam, I need to watch my position\r\nBitches are sneaky, triflin', and not to be trusted\n\nA weak link in the team, in the chain of combustion\n\nDon't trust her, love is for suckas\n\nToo many enemies is out there son, tryin' to bring the ruckus\n\nKeep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade\n\nKeep doin' what we're doin', gettin' money and gettin' paid\n\n\n\n(Hook: William Hart)\n\nEnemies all around me\n\nOne mistake and they'll down me\n\nThey just wanna rain on my parade\n\nI said the enemies all around you\n\nOne mistake and they'll down you\n\nThey just wanna rain on your parade\n\n\n\n(Verse 2: Ghostface Killah)\n\nIt's mind, body, the heart wants it, the mind rejects it\n\nFuck the past, let's put the present in perspective\n\nThat's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me\n\nStand butt-naked in the storm, sippin' the frosty\n\nForce me to choose, I'mma follow my heart\n\nShe was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart\n\nNo more delucas, straight Killa Bee on the swarm\n\nAnd when it's time to get big, she put her game face on\n\n\n\n(Hook: William Hart)\n\nEnemies all around me\n\nOne mistake and they'll down me\n\nThey just wanna rain on my parade\n\nI said the enemies all around you\n\nOne mistake and they'll down you\n\nThey just wanna rain on your parade"
