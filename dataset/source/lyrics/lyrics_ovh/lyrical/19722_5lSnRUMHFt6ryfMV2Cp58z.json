  "lyrics": "When I'm crying from the darkness\r\nWhen I'm looking for a sign\r\nWhen I'm feeling like I can't go on\r\nYou close in on all sides\r\nYou are stronger than my doubting\r\nYour love finds me when I hide\n\nAnd even when I try to live without You\n\nYou are always kind\n\n\n\nI am undone, o-oh\n\nI am undone\n\n\n\nWhen You cried out from the garden\n\nLet Your will be done, not mine\n\nWhen You took the weight of my mistakes\n\nSo I don't have to fight 'em\n\nNow I let the sun rise on every scar and every sign\n\nOf when You took this bruise and dying soul\n\nAnd breathed it back to life\n\n\n\nI am undone, o-oh\n\nI am undone, o-o-oh! oh\n\nI am undone, o-oh\n\nI am undone, o-o-oh! oh\n\n\n\nOn and on, on and on\n\nYou carry me\n\nYou are there, You are there\n\nEven in my wandering\n\nWhen I fall, when I fall\n\nOh, let it be at the cross\n\n\n\nAnd I am undone, o-oh\n\nI am undone\n\nI am undone, o-oh\n\nI am undone, o-o-oh! oh\n\n\n\nOn and on, on and on\n\nYou carry me\n\nYou are there, You are there\n\nEven in my wandering\n\nWhen I fall, when I fall\n\nLet it be at the cross\n\nI am undone"
