  "lyrics": "Watch it all play out\r\nReactions too familiar\r\nThe way I act too dissimilar\r\nTo always see it in my mind\r\nSay just what you mean\r\nThe love I don't believe in\n\nThe days we spend deflating\n\nAnd passing by the time\n\n\n\nStand up straight\n\nWith my back against the wall\n\nKeep me still\n\nAnd wondering just why we falter\n\nDon't you want to stay here\n\nOr do you want to phase me out\n\nDon't you want to lay here\n\nOr would you rather do without\n\n\n\nEventually you'll crack\n\nAnd remember there's no need for\n\nSiphoning some reason\n\nFrom a dissipating line we drew\n\n\n\nStand up straight\n\nWith my back against the wall\n\nKeep me still\n\nAnd wondering just why we falter\n\nDon't you want to stay here\n\nOr do you want to phase me out\n\nDon't you want to lay here\n\nOr would you rather do without\n\n\n\nStand up straight\n\nWith my back against the wall\n\nKeep me still\n\nAnd wondering just why we falter\n\nDon't you want to stay here\n\nOr do you want to phase me out\n\nDon't you want to lay here\n\nOr would you rather do without\n\n\n\nDon't you want to stay here\n\nOr do you want to phase me out"
