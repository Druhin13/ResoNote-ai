  "lyrics": "Small flakes of snow or just grains in a globe that you shake\r\nPassenger trains getting slower the older you get\r\nBut time don't scare me, no\r\nThe future's still so young\n\nAll of my friends\n\nAll of their ghosts\n\nThey try to remember the days when they\n\nDrew all their plans\n\nAll of their hopes\n\nBut we'll never bend cause you know that\n\nOnce it was impossible to fly\n\nFollow the ones with dreams too high\n\n\n\nStars studded sky, or just cheap plastic lights that just blink\n\nWaiting on magic, won't find it if you don't believe\n\nBut time don't scare me, no\n\n\n\nAll of my friends\n\nAll of their ghosts\n\nThey try to remember the days when they drew\n\nAll their plans\n\nAll of their hopes\n\nBut we'll never bend cause you know that\n\nOnce it was impossible to fly\n\nFollow the ones with dreams too high\n\nFollow the ones with dreams too high"
