  "lyrics": "Isn't it strange, impossible to claim your reward\r\nI cannot explain, emotions I can barely afford to contain\r\nYou're the same, you hide away from anything that turns you on\r\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\nNo words only scream, could possibly protect you, you know what it means\n\n\n\nTwo is the charm, a place therein around us and pray and pray\n\n\n\nAnd saying the name there is no blame, there is no shame, and even more\n\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\n\n\nAgain, again\n\nI know the shame I've waste it all on someone else's time\n\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\nNobody gets what they want anymore\n\n\n\nWhat am I going to do when you're in trouble\n\nAnd you don't call out for me?\n\nWhat am I going to do when I can see that you've been crying\n\nAnd you don't want no help from me?\n\nBaby, I can't separate us out anymore\n\nBaby, I can't separate us out anymore"
