  "lyrics": "Time changed\r\nWe're different\r\nBut my mind still says redundant things\r\nCan I not think?\r\nWill you love this part of me\r\nMy lover is a day I can't forget\n\nFurthering my distance from you\n\nRealistically I can't leave now\n\nBut I'm okay as long as you\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\n\n\nStraight up ahead\n\nYou'll find a sign that says you can't get by with a lie\n\nBut if I stayed away by a thread from the glory path and made my life harder lying 'bout the stupid shit I say\n\nThen you wouldn't know a single thing about how I feel about you and all those really dumb things people feel\n\nI'll take the bumpy road it'll probably break my legs\n\nAs long as I don’t show you what’s ruining my head\n\nFunny thing about you is you read me pretty well\n\nBut you haven't found me yet at the bottom of the well\n\nAnnoying you with smoke signals asking you for help\n\n'cause your immediate presence lifts me straight away from hell\n\nMe and Mr. Heart we say the cutest things about you\n\nHow you seem unreal and we'd probably die so quick without you\n\nSuffocated from the radiated air around us full of happiness we don't have brightness gone so dark without you girl\n\n\n\nTime changed\n\nWe're different\n\nBut my mind still says redundant things\n\nCan I not think\n\nWill you love this part of me\n\nMy lover is a day I can't forget\n\nFurthering my distance from you\n\nRealistically I can't leave now\n\nBut I'm okay as long as you\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\n\n\nFamily calls me crazy and my friends say I'm degenerate\n\nBut you tell me I'm so generous and my self worth isn't hideous\n\nThis psychedelic canvas or the person I'm becoming\n\nWent from horror movie on TV to happy ending princess me\n\nProcessing the information transferred from your mind to me at Light speed like the Falcon from the original Star Wars trilogy\n\nFeeling like a free ol' me when I was 6 and no worries would stop me from reaching the stars a million miles away from me\n\nSick in the head for you and no cure has been discovered like a plague hitting my body except if I fall I'm just fallin' for you\n\nConscious beyond knowledge alterations are acknowledged, and the beauty you've inflicted is always in its action\n\nLovely day today, perfect time to open up to you\n\nBut I know that you're having fun wouldn't wanna mess this up for you\n\nBut I'm happy that you're happy and at least I do that much for you\n\nAlways glad you're with me this emotion will be gone before you know\n\n\n\nTime changed\n\nWe're different\n\nBut my mind still says redundant things\n\nCan I not think\n\nWill you love this part of me\n\nMy lover is a day I can't forget\n\nFurthering my distance from you\n\nRealistically I can't leave now\n\nBut I'm okay as long as you\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\n\n\nTime changed\n\nWe're different\n\nBut my mind still says redundant things\n\nCan I not think\n\nWill you love this part of me\n\nMy lover is a day I can't forget\n\nFurthering my distance from you\n\nRealistically I can't leave now\n\nBut I'm okay as long as you\n\nKeep me from going crazy\n\nKeep me from going crazy"
