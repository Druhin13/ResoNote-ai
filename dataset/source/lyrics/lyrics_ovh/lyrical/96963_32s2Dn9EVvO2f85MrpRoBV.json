  "lyrics": "Know we're scared of us, what this might become\r\nAin't no goin' back no more, no more\r\nWe're in the same bed, cannot lay awake\r\nLet's fill up this space with us\r\nButterfly, yeah, yeah\n\nYou make me feel brand new\n\n\n\nOh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin'\n\nNo, don't go lookin' for somethin'\n\nOh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin'\n\nNo, don't go lookin' for somethin'\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nSo you seem to think you're invisible\n\nYou're so far from silhouette\n\nYou tell on yourself between every word\n\nAnd leave all this room for me\n\n\n\nButterfly, yeah\n\nI miss feelin' for you\n\n\n\nOh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin'\n\nNo, don't go lookin' for somethin'\n\nOh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin'\n\nNo, don't go lookin' for somethin'\n\n\n\nYou speak in dictionaries while fearing less than all will understand\n\nVirgo moon, I'm so used to your dance\n\nTongue too swole to comprehend\n\nI see you duck and dodge at every bend\n\nAfraid to play your card, be forced to show your hand\n\nI hope you take from this that it'll make you no less of a man\n\nTo break your walls and simply grab my hand\n\nLove shouldn't be contraband\n\nIt shouldn't treble on your confidence\n\nShouldn't be seen as less than compliments"
