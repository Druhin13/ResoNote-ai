  "lyrics": "Go, go, safe from going through the storm\r\nSlow burn, drag behind me through the snow\r\nRich spoon, water goes to washed-up gods\r\nDone, done, dreaming of your fellow sons\r\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\n\n\nClosed sleep, picture me a little older\n\nTo give is deep, blooming like a deserts flower\n\n\n\nYet she tastes like you and she breathes like you\n\nAnd she leaps like you, like you\n\n\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\n\n\nYet she tastes, like you and she breathes, like you\n\nAnd she leaps like you, like you\n\n\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come\n\nI never look around to see how far I've come"
