Hey! I want more wenches\nHey! Hey! More wenches and mead\nHey! Hey! I want more wenches\nLots of wenches is what I need\n\nWhen I come back from a mighty quest\nI have no need for sleep or rest\n\nI head to a tavern for a drink\nAnd get so drunk I cannot think\nA wench by my side and a jug of mead\nThese are the things that I most need\nSo I sit back and sing this song\nAnd drink and party all night long\n\nHey! Hey! I want more wenches\nHey! Hey! More wenches and mead\nHey! Hey! I want more wenches\nLots of wenches is what I need"
