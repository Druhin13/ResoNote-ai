  "lyrics": "You locked a knife inside my heart\r\nBuried a key inside my mind\r\nThe maps surveyed, the X you chart\r\nWhere our hands go to hide\r\nWill our needs stay level\n\nAs the terrain starts to grade high?\n\nShould I remain unsettled?\n\nWatch goodnight turn to goodbye\n\nGoodnight turn to goodbye\n\n\n\nHold on to me\n\nTell me you've got me, sweetheart\n\nThe world is going dim in my gaze\n\nSweet vertigo\n\nFeel my lungs heaving, choking\n\nClawing down my back, panic attack\n\nI'm alone, watch me float as I fall\n\n\n\nThe soundtrack placed over this heart\n\nIt shares no rhythm of mine\n\nIt juts and sways, it ends and starts\n\nAll in and out of our time\n\n\n\nOh, I can be your dancer\n\nThe one you set within your sights\n\nWhen I admit surrender\n\nThen maybe goodbye will turn to goodnight\n\nGoodbye will turn to goodnight\n\n\n\nHold on to me\n\nTell me you've got me, sweetheart\n\nThe world is going dim in my gaze\n\nSweet vertigo\n\nFeel my lungs heaving, choking\n\nClawing down my back, panic attack\n\nI'm alone, watch me float as I fall\n\n\n\nOh no, we have been cursed\n\nThe stage set for a tragic verse\n\nOur love protocol romance\n\nOur air drained of happenstance\n\n\n\nWhat have we turned ourselves into?\n\nThis abstract personnel\n\n\n\nHold on to me\n\nTell me you've got me, sweetheart\n\nThe world is going dim in my gaze\n\nSweet vertigo\n\nFeel my lungs heaving, choking\n\nClawing down my back, panic attack\n\nI'm alone, watch me float as I fall\n\n\n\nOh, watch me float\n\nOh, watch me float\n\nWatch me float as I fall"
