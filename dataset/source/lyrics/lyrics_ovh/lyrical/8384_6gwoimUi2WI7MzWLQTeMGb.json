  "lyrics": "It's my sunny disposition that you liked\r\nYou poured me coke and vodka\r\nDrink it baby, be nice\r\nAnd you knew you would get away\r\nSo you didn't try to hide\r\nI watched them shake your hand\n\nTheir obedient laughter cut my mind\n\n\n\nDon't want your money for my silence\n\nI don't care who knows your name\n\nDon't tell your friends that I'm a lyin' to convince them I'm insane\n\n\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\n\n\nI need you to know that I'm not too proud of this\n\nMy strength lies within my gentleness\n\nAnd I'm already hurt so now I don't have to hide\n\nAnd I hold all the heads of my brothers and sisters high\n\n\n\nDon't want your money for my silence\n\nI don't care who knows my name\n\nDon't tell your friends that I'm a lyin' to convince them I'm insane\n\n\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\n\n\nI'm free, I'm floating over my body on the floor\n\nI grab it, I tell myself don't be ashamed any more\n\n\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\nOver my dead body oh\n\n\n\nOver my dead"
