  "lyrics": "I've come here nine times asking you to not make it ten\r\nI'm peeling off all the honor that protected my skin\r\nApologize, I'm laying down my ego to rest\r\nWould you be mine forever? Just in case it exists\r\nI think about the old days\n\nWhat we've been through to survive\n\nDo we get better with time?\n\nTell me I'm wrong\n\n\n\nLooking back to the start\n\nWho we were when we met\n\nThis box of pictures tells a story\n\nWhen we fight, we forget\n\nAnd I can barely recognize us\n\nBack then we were obsessed\n\nCan we cut out this madness and get back to the best?\n\n\n\nThink about the old days\n\nWhat we've been through to survive\n\nDo we get better with time?\n\nTell me I'm wrong\n\nI'm looking to you always\n\nWe follow the same guiding light\n\nPassing like ships in the night\n\nCan we hang on?\n\nCan we hang on?\n\n\n\nCan we hang on?\n\nCan we hang on?\n\nCan we hang on?\n\n\n\nThis could've gone either way\n\nIf one of us had walked\n\nIf I'd gone off, and you caved in\n\nAnd we broke it off\n\nI'd be lost\n\nI'd be chasing some broke down dream\n\nI'd be bored to death\n\nBut we cannot stay forever young and out of our heads\n\nOut of our heads\n\n\n\nI think about tomorrow\n\nIf I can get through tonight\n\nI know that we'll be alright\n\nCan we be strong?\n\nI'm looking to you always\n\nEven though we're like ships in the night\n\nDon't you go passing me by\n\nCan we hang on?\n\nCan we hang on?\n\n\n\nCan we hang on?\n\nCan we hang on?\n\nCan we hang on?\n\n\n\nYou can find it\n\nIf you're dying to live\n\nIf you want to know the secret, hang on\n\nYou can find it\n\nIf you're dying to live\n\nIf you want to know the secret, hang on\n\nYou can find it\n\nIf you're dying to live\n\nIf you want to know the secret, hang on"
