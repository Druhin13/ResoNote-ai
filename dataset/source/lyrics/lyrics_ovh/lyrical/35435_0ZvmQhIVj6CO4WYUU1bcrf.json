  "lyrics": "As the moon ascends\r\nThe wolves come out to see the end\r\nThey hide from view and wait\r\nTo watch the ghost inside you come awake\r\nAnd when the shots go off, you hear them call\r\nMy heart is racing just to see it all\n\nTo watch you crawl out of your changing shape\n\nTake all your breath and watch it come awake\n\n\n\nFrom the flames of the fire,\n\nI feel you crawling to my bed\n\nThrowing shapes at the sky,\n\nI watch you crying to me\n\n\n\nWith your knees open\n\nI display you, taunt the beast again\n\n'Cause when you move and shake\n\nThat thing inside you comes awake\n\nAs you dance against the breathing wall\n\nMy claws are out, I want to feel it all\n\nFeel it crawl inside you, changing shape\n\nTake out your breath and feel you come awake\n\n\n\nFrom the flames of the fire,\n\nI feel you crawling to my bed\n\nThrowing shapes at the sky,\n\nI watch you crying to me\n\n\n\nSay something, pray for something\n\nSay something, pray to something\n\nSay something, pray to something\n\nSay something, pray to something\n\nSay...\n\n\n\n(From the flames of the fire\n\nI watch you crawling to me)\n\n\n\nFrom the flames of the fire,\n\nI feel you crawling to my bed\n\nThrowing shapes at the sky,\n\nI watch you crying to me\n\n\n\nSAY SOMETHING! PRAY FOR SOMETHING!\n\nSAY SOMETHING! PRAY TO SOMETHING!\n\nSAY"
