  "lyrics": "Holding back the flood in this skyscraper town\r\nYou gave all that sweat and blood, now you think you're gonna drown\r\nYou can't tell that you're bigger than the sea that you're sinking in\r\nAnd you don't know what you got but you got it at your fingertips\r\nOoh, you got it in you\n\nOoh, you got it in you\n\n\n\nWhen the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark\n\nNo one ever told you this would be so hard\n\nI know you think your fire is burning out\n\nBut I still see you shining through\n\nYou got it in you\n\n\n\nNot everything you hear should sound like the truth\n\n'Cause nobody else's words can define you\n\nMaybe you don't see it but you're quicker than the world can spin\n\nYou should know what you got cause you got it at your fingertips\n\n\n\nOoh, you got it in you\n\nOoh, you got it in you\n\n\n\nWhen the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark\n\nNo one ever told you this would be so hard\n\nI know you think your fire is burning out\n\nBut I still see you shining through\n\nYou got it in you\n\n\n\nWhen the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark\n\nNo one ever told you this would be so hard\n\nI know you think your fire is burning out\n\nBut I still see you shining through\n\nYou got it in you\n\nYou got it in you\n\nYou got it in you"
