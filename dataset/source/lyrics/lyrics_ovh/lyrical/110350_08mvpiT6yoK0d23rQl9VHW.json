  "lyrics": "Sleep tight\r\nI will come to your defense\r\nWhatever road you're taking\r\nTonight\r\nI know nothing's making sense\r\nBut I'll guard the room you wake in\n\n\n\nClose your eyes\n\nFollow the sound of my voice\n\nMy voice\n\n\n\nCause I'm gonna sing\n\nYou are the boat, I'm the ocean that rocks you to sleep\n\nYou're the balloon, I'm the ballast attached to the string\n\nIf you're into deep\n\nOr you climb to high\n\nOn this wild\n\nThis wild ride\n\n\n\nSleep tight\n\nThere are dreams you have not dreamed\n\nAnd doors to worlds unopened\n\nDon't fight\n\nSome questions aren't worth answering\n\nSome hearts that break aren't broken\n\n\n\nClose your eyes\n\nFollow the sound of my voice\n\nMy voice\n\n\n\nCause I'm gonna sing\n\nYou are the boat, I'm the ocean that rocks you to sleep\n\nYou're the balloon, I'm the ballast attached to the string\n\nIf you're into deep\n\nOr you climb to high\n\nOn this wild\n\nThis wild ride\n\nThis wild ride\n\nDon't know what you'll find\n\nOn this wild, this wild ride"
