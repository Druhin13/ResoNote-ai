  "lyrics": "Stare in the mirror lines on my face yeah\r\nI wonder where the time has gone\r\nIt's been a long hard road out from the grave, but I keep a moving on\r\nI been up, down, turned around, kicked hard to the ground,\r\nKeep a coming back again\n\nFrom the ashes, from the flame\n\nI'm here to light the fire again\n\n\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\n\n\nI'm a man on a mission, you better listen\n\nAin't nobody gonna stop the show\n\nRiding high on my horse, ass in my saddle\n\nAll revved up ready to go\n\nI've had nine lives, every time, roll the dice, pay the price\n\nI do it all again\n\n\n\nAnother day, another dance\n\nFrom the dead, a second chance\n\n\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\n\n\nI'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back\n\nI'm back, I'm back, I'm resurrected\n\n\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\n\n\nI'm back, Resurrected\n\nI'm back, Resurrected"
