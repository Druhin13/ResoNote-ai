  "lyrics": "Maybe I was yours to keep\r\nBurning in the eyes you heap\r\nSomeday I will take your hand\r\nMoving through another land\r\nAnd every single second tears\n\nThe skin from in front of you\n\nBut I'll be right behind your eyes\n\nTurning to another (?)\n\n\n\nAnd every single breath you take\n\nWill be haunting, oh\n\nAgainst the weight\n\n\n\nMaybe I was 'sposed to fall\n\nTurn into a sagging song\n\nEvery single heart forgive\n\nMust've filled the arms of grace (?)\n\n\n\nI'll be right behind your eyes\n\nWorking through the walls you light\n\nTell every single warmth betrayed\n\nI'll be holding on against the way(?)\n\n\n\nMoments only seem to pass\n\nDays are never born to last\n\nWithout you I never had a chance\n\nFrom the moment you left my hand\n\nI was trying to be someone I can't\n\nBut she wouldn't let you back\n\nNow I'm tired of waiting for you tonight\n\n\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\nOooh...\n\n\n\nHanging on a single breath\n\nScreaming 'til there's nothing left\n\nIt's just all we'll ever find\n\nBroken as all our minds"
