  "lyrics": "We took a flight to the Pacific Northwest\r\nI've had a longing to go there deep in my chest\r\nLike a dream\r\nLeft Portland in the mornin' headed for the coast\r\nFeels like middle of nowhere, windin' down this road\r\nAnd then I see it\n\nThis can't be real\n\n\n\nI've never seen a greener green than that\n\nThe sea salt air I'm breathin' brings life back\n\nTogether, we're alive and free, holdin' hands on the beach\n\nAnd I remember what it is to be\n\nSo green\n\nIt was so green\n\n\n\nTake a lighthouse tour, we saw the octopus tree\n\nFeels like some Wes Anderson movie scene\n\nIn the breeze\n\nMade a bonfire on the beach, talked late into the night\n\nWe made love after bottles of cheap red wine\n\nIt was way too sweet (mmm, yeah)\n\nYou taste so sweet\n\n\n\nI've never seen a greener green than that\n\nThe sea salt air I'm breathin' brings life back\n\nTogether, we're alive and free, holdin' hands on the beach\n\nAnd I remember what it is to be\n\nSo green\n\nYeah, it was so green\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, oh\n\n\n\nI've never seen a greener green than that\n\nThe sea salt air I'm breathin' brings life back\n\nTogether, we're alive and free, holdin' hands on the beach\n\nAnd I remember what it is to be\n\nYou and I rememberin' what it is to be\n\nSo green\n\nIt was so green"
