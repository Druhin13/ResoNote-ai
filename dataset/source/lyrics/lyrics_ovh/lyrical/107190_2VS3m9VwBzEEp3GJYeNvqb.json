  "lyrics": "Well, baby, there you stand.\r\nWith your little head down in your hands. \nOh, my God, you can't believe It's happening again \nYour baby's gone and you're all alone and it looks like the end \nYou're back out on the street snd you're trying to remember \nHow do you start it over? You don't know if you can. \n\nYou don't care much for a stranger's touch but you can't hold your man \n\nYou never thought you'd be alone this far down the line \n\nAnd I know what's been on your mind You're afraid it's all been wasted time \n\n\n\nThe autumn leaves have got you thinkin' about the first time that you fell \n\nYou didn't love the boy too much, no no, you just loved the boy too well \n\nSo you live from day to day, and you dream about tomorrow \n\nAnd the hours go by like minutes, and the shadows come to stay \n\nSo you take a little somethin' to make them go away \n\nI could 've done so many things, baby if I could only stop my mind \n\nFrom wonderin' what I left behind, and from worryin' about this wasted time \n\n\n\nAnother love has come and gone and the years keep rushin' on \n\nI remember what you told me before you went out on your own \n\n\"Sometimes to keep it together, we got to leave it alone.\" \n\nSo you can get on with your search, baby, and I can get on with mine \n\nAnd maybe someday we will find that it wasn't really wasted time."
