  "lyrics": "Three months, one week\r\nBoth of us we know this day would come\r\nNew hair, new jeans\r\nHaven't seen you out\r\nWhat's going on?\r\nI can see behind your smiling eyes\n\nThat you're holding back the truth\n\n\n\nYou can say it's going great\n\nBut, baby, I know\n\nThat's just something people say when they can't let go\n\nSo, I won't clap my hands\n\nAnd I won't stomp my feet\n\nCause I can tell it hurts like hell\n\nI'm happy and you know it\n\n\n\nI would tell you\n\nBut I know you've seen the pictures\n\nI've found someone new\n\nAnd finally I feel the butterflies\n\nOh, I can see behind your smiling eyes\n\nThat you wanna tell the truth\n\n\n\nYou can say it's going great\n\nBut, baby, I know\n\nThat's just something people say when they can't let go\n\nSo, I won't clap my hands\n\nAnd I won't stomp my feet\n\nCause I can tell it hurts like hell\n\nI'm happy and you know it\n\nKnow, know it\n\n\n\nYou can see behind the smiling eyes\n\nAnd you know I'm over you\n\n\n\nYou can say it's going great\n\nBut, baby, I know\n\nThat's just something people say when they can't let go\n\nSo, I won't clap my hands\n\nAnd I won't stomp my feet\n\nCause I can tell it hurts like hell\n\nI'm happy and you know it\n\nKnow, know it"
