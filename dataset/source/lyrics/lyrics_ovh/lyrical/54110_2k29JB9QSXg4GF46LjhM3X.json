  "lyrics": "She grew up around here on that southwest side\r\nWhere the corn grows up to the road side\r\nWent to high school here, got that Panther pride\r\nShe'll be cheering them on every Friday night\r\nShe couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap\n\nCouldn't help but shine with a heart like that\n\nNew York called when she turned 21\n\nBut she never forgot where she came from\n\n\n\nI need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl\n\nWith a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls\n\nI've been looking all over, all over the world\n\nFor a pretty little homegrown hometown girl\n\n\n\nHer mamma's mamma was born right here\n\nAnd her roots run deeper than that old town square\n\nShe's a good girl but she's not uptight\n\nShe can rise and shine and she can hang all night\n\n\n\nI need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl\n\nWith a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls\n\nI've been looking all over, all over the world\n\nFor a pretty little homegrown hometown girl\n\n\n\nShe's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth\n\nWhen she gives her love she knows what it's worth\n\nThere's a lot of pretty girls out there to me\n\nBut there's nothing like the one right across the street\n\n\n\nI need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl\n\nWith a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls\n\nI've been looking all over, all over the world\n\nFor a pretty little homegrown hometown girl\n\n\n\nI need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl..."
