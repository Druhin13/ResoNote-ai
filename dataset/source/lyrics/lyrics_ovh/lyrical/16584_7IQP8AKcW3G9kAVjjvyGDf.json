  "lyrics": "Why do you fear joy\r\nWhy am I unemployed\r\nWhy is my skin cracked\r\nThere is a burning fire in my back\r\nWhy is my youth blue\n\nWhy is my fear for you\n\nWhy does it resonate\n\nWhy does it change from day to day, and I’m lost\n\n\n\nI feel weak\n\nI’m counting on some sleep\n\nCuz I feel numb\n\n\n\nCome call me erasable\n\nCome call me erasable\n\nCome call me erasable\n\nCome call me erasable\n\n\n\nDANCE\n\nCRY\n\nLIVE\n\nDIE\n\nWALK\n\nRUN\n\nPalpitations are numbing my tongue\n\n\n\nWhen I move, when I move it comes straight from the hips\n\nIf great comes from anywhere then call me a hit\n\nI fear like I resonate, I resonate with fear\n\nCome call me reflective, reflections appear, and I’m lost\n\n\n\nI feel sure\n\nI’m always self assured\n\nI feel undone\n\n\n\nI feel immune\n\nI’m pining over you\n\nI feel so young\n\n\n\nCome call me erasable\n\nCome call me erasable\n\nCome call me erasable\n\nCome call me erasable\n\n\n\nCome call me erasable (Why do you fear joy)\n\nCome call me erasable (Why am I unemployed)\n\nCome call me erasable (Why is my skin cracked)\n\nCome call me erasable (There is a burning fire in my back)"
