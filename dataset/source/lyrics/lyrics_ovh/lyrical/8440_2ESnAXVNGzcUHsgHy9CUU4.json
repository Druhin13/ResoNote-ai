  "lyrics": "At 22 years old\r\nThey're telling me I'll never make it on my own\r\nThat I should leave it all behind and let it go\r\nLet the industry decide my tomorrow\r\nBut I can feel it and I know I'm getting close\r\nI stand on stage with people singing words I wrote\n\nI feel the music make its way throughout their buds\n\nSo if I give it all up now I'll never know\n\n\n\nYou know that I can't be anybody else\n\nI feel better when I know myself\n\nYou keep telling me I need your help\n\nI won't ever need your help\n\nNo, I'll never need your help\n\n\n\nAt 23 years old\n\nTook just under a year to prove them wrong\n\nNow they decide they wanna listen to my songs\n\nAnd take the credit for what I've already done\n\nBut everything I've done so far I've done alone\n\nNow they're left out leaving missed calls on my phone\n\nTrying to cut in line for tickets to my show\n\nI guess I knew I had it in me all along\n\n\n\nYou know that I can't be anybody else\n\nI feel better when I know myself\n\nYou keep telling me I need your help\n\nI won't ever need your help\n\nNo, I'll never need your help\n\n\n\nI was told when I was 13\n\nI could do things others couldn't seem to believe 'til they met me\n\nThat's when I'd retreat to my dreams where I see things others couldn't see through a beat pen and poetry\n\nNow I know I breathe for a reason\n\nNow I know I write from the mind of a teacher\n\nJust to watch the sheep as they wait for a leader\n\nNow I guess they found out who I am\n\n\n\nYou know that I can't be anybody else\n\nI feel better when I know myself\n\nYou keep telling me I need your help\n\nI won't ever need your help\n\nYou know that I can't be anybody else\n\nI feel better when I know myself\n\nYou keep telling me I need your help\n\nI won't ever need your help\n\nNo, I'll never need your help"
