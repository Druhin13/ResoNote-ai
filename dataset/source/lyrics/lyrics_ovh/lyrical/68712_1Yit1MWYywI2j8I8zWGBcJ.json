  "lyrics": "You're something like safety\r\nI'm no good without you\r\nSo hurry home\r\nThe voice I'm hearing in my head\r\nIs never the one that falls out\r\nPlease hurry back\n\n\n\nI've still got this magic way\n\nOf pushing everyone away\n\nOf always waiting too long\n\nTo mean the things I say\n\nAlways pause for something better\n\nThe right words and the right letters\n\nThe moments passed\n\nAnd I've let it slip away\n\n\n\nYou're something like safety\n\nAnd I'm no good without you\n\nSo hurry home\n\nThe voice I'm hearing in my head\n\nIs never the one that falls out\n\nPlease hurry back\n\n\n\nI could have burned a lighter brighter\n\nI could have shone a little more\n\nI could have pushed our little hope out\n\nA little further from the shore\n\nBut the sand is always sinking\n\nThe creek's full of this decay\n\nStop the ceaseless thinking\n\nAnd get out of my way\n\n\n\nBut reality's a motherfucker\n\nPreach boldness: act cold\n\nI've got nothing nice to say\n\nThis would hurt less\n\nIf I were twenty three\n\nNot twenty nine on the bathroom floor\n\nTrying to get clean"
