  "lyrics": "Fuck me like you mean it\r\nMake me worship you, I'm a believer\r\nCome, erase the static in my head, pull me close to your chest\r\nLike a secret you kept in the dark\r\nBreak me into pieces\r\nTake away the breath I’m barely breathing\n\nI can feel you running through my blood, the adrenaline rush\n\nHits my heart like a drug, lift me up\n\n\n\nMake me feel like it's better than life\n\nMake me feel like it's better than life\n\n\n\nHow can I be strong?\n\nYou know all the weaknesses I got\n\nCome and fill the spaces in my thoughts, are you ready or not?\n\nBring me down on my knees with your cross\n\n\n\nMake me feel like it’s better than life\n\nMake me feel like it's better than life\n\n\n\nIt's better than life\n\nIt's better than life\n\n\n\n\n\nMake me feel like it's better than life\n\nMake me feel like it's better than life\n\n\n\nIt's better than life\n\nIt's better than life\n\n\n\nIt’s better than life"
