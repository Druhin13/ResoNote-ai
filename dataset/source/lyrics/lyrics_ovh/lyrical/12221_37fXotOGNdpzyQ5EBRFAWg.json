  "lyrics": "For you I'm not afraid to make mistakes\r\nAnd you have never asked me once to change\r\nWhenever I'm in doubt you put the fire out\r\nAnd we, we never need to compromise\r\nBut if we ever did I'd take your side\r\nNot all are great at love, but I do my best because\n\n\n\nFor you I would breathe underwater\n\nAnd for you I would fly without wings\n\nAnd for you I would run like the sun chases the moon\n\nCause everything I do is all for you\n\n\n\nFor you I have nothing left to ask\n\nCause you have always been my better half\n\nIf love is the reason we're alive you are my only air supply\n\n\n\nFor you I would breathe underwater\n\nAnd for you I would fly without wings\n\nAnd for you I would run like the sun chases the moon\n\nCause everything I do is all for you\n\n\n\nIf your love could take me higher\n\nI don't mind if I do\n\nCause your eyes are wide on fire\n\nBet our lungs will run right through\n\nAnd the tides will surely rise up\n\nAnd I'll just look at you\n\nI don't mind if I do\n\n\n\nFor you I would breathe underwater\n\nAnd for you I would fly without wings\n\nAnd for you I would run like the sun chases the moon\n\nCause everything I do is all for you\n\n\n\nI would breathe underwater\n\nAnd for you I would fly without wings\n\nBecause of you I can do all that I set my heart to\n\nAnd everything I do is all for you"
