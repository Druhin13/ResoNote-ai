  "title": "Sometimes",
  "lyrics": "Some stupid pictures, some vacation, someone I don't know\r\nAnd ten expert opinions on some strangers post\r\nAnd then I know, much to my surprise\r\nFrom a face I haven't seen in a long, long time\r\nTo say you're fine over a couple pages\n\nBetween the lines, you were really sayin'\n\n\n\nSometimes\n\nI just wonder what it would have been like\n\nIf you were with me\n\nDon't worry your mind\n\nI'm not cryin' at night\n\nI just think o' you sometimes\n\nSometimes, yeah\n\n\n\nHe's walkin' his dog out on Venice Beach\n\nSaid he came to Los Angeles to chase some dream\n\nIn ninety-five, he said, \"I left my girls behind\n\nAnd the time for second chances, it's been gone for a long time\"\n\n\n\nI called her phone, and I rambled on again, but\n\nAfter the tone, what I really meant was\n\n\n\nSometimes\n\nI just wonder what it would have been like\n\nIf you were with me\n\nDon't worry your mind\n\nI'm not cryin' at night\n\nI just think o' you sometimes\n\nOh-ooh\n\n\n\nWe say goodbye, as if we're goin' places\n\nAnd you can try, but you can't keep your heart from sayin'\n\n\n\nSometimes\n\nI just wonder what it would have been like\n\nIf you were with me\n\nDon't worry your mind\n\nI'm not cryin' at night\n\nI just think o' you\n\nI still think o' you\n\nI just think o' you sometimes"
