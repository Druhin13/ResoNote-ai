  "lyrics": "I'm hollowed out where a bright crux used to be\r\nI'm shredding my skin like you wouldn't believe\r\nI couldn't help myself I just needed to grieve\r\nWhile I lived vacant in a memory\r\nBacktrack never thought I'd ever be back\n\nThink fast never thought I'd ever be last\n\nI'm selfish with time it's my only worth\n\nStep back cuz I'm feeling really outmatched\n\nForced in while I'm dealing with the contrast\n\nYou're far from me that's hard for me tread carefully\n\n\n\nI'm tongue tied inside with a little bit of lust mixed in to mold myself this solitude I live in\n\nPretend like I'm never gonna need a friend again\n\nI'll keep myself intact\n\n\n\nDrift away to a place that's not so harrowing\n\nTo the back plate of my mind, digging up what's left to find\n\nWith the bar set way to high for me I'm bound to sink uncomfortably\n\n\n\nI'm tongue tied inside with a little bit of lust mixed in to mold myself this solitude I live in\n\nPretend like I'm never gonna need a friend again\n\nI'll keep myself intact"
