Word to this\n\n\n\nWho want war? 'Bout it, 'bout it\n\nI'm with that, you ain't 'bout it\n\nWant no smoke, want no pressure\n\nYou ain't goon, we gon' test you\n\nWho want war? 'Bout it, 'bout it\n\nI'm with that, you ain't 'bout it\n\nWant no smoke, want no pressure\n\nYou ain't goon, we gon' test you\n\nWho want war? 'Bout it, 'bout it\n\nI'm with that, you ain't 'bout it\n\nWant no smoke, want no pressure\n\nYou ain't goon, we gon' test you\n\n\n\nIn the back of the back, I'm gettin' that head, but I stop to charge the Tesla\n\nTryna fuck your friend, babe, what she say? You playin', you should let me text her\n\nRun it up, more [?], AP with a iced out bezel\n\nYou gon' [?], 'til it get pink, green, hold up, on my chain gold medal\n\nI'm runnin' that track so quick, Usain Bolt\n\nAnd I got Givenchy on my toes\n\nNigga got too much ice on me, it's gettin' cold\n\nAnd I'm wearin' Saint Laurent for my winter coat\n\nI was up in Palm Springs and I'm blowin' Os\n\nBad bitches on me, and they all on go\n\nI ain't with the talkin', see that by my pole\n\nSuck me till she cough, lil mom, put me in your throat\n\nFor they won't\n\n\n\nWho want war? 'Bout it, 'bout it\n\nI'm with that, you ain't 'bout it\n\nWant no smoke, want no pressure\n\nYou ain't goon, we gon' test you\n\nWho want war? 'Bout it, 'bout it\n\nI'm with that, you ain't 'bout it\n\nWant no smoke, want no pressure\n\nYou ain't goon, we gon' test you"
