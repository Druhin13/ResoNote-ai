  "lyrics": "Yes, I understand, every life must end, uh-huh\r\nAs we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh\r\nOh I'm a lucky one, to count on both hands the ones I love\r\nSome folks just got one, others, they've got none, uh-huh\r\nStay with me...\n\nLet's just breathe...\n\n\n\nPracticed all my sins, never let me win, uh-huh\n\nUnder everything, just another human being, uh-huh\n\nWell I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed\n\n\n\nStay with me...\n\nYou're all I see...\n\n\n\nDid I say that I need you?\n\nDid I say that I want you?\n\nOh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see\n\nNo one knows this more than me\n\n\n\nAs I come clean...\n\nI wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh\n\nEverything you gave and nothing you would take, uh-huh\n\n\n\nNothing you would take...\n\nEverything you gave...\n\n\n\nDid I say that I need you?\n\nDid I say that I want you?\n\nOh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see\n\nNo one knows this more than me\n\nAs I come clean, ah...\n\n\n\nNothing you would take\n\nEverything you gave\n\nHold me 'til I die\n\nMeet you on the other side..."
