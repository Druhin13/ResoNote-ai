  "lyrics": "Check me out\r\nLook\r\nI know perfect timing feels like I'm too late\r\nAnd I know I'm still great in spite of my mistakes\r\nYou know it's authentic, every rhyme I say\n\nMy only regret is I made niggas wait\n\nSee, ain't too many like us, we like vintage Bape\n\nAnd I don't fuck with busters, I can't integrate\n\nGrew up with these killers in my living space\n\nLotta niggas folded through them village days\n\nCitywide, gang and junction police raids\n\nL.A. Times, Rollin 60s, made the front page\n\nI vowed to never let you ditch and seal my fate\n\nSellin' dope with hopes to graduate to real estate\n\nI knew I was drummin' to a different beat\n\nFelt it in my stomach, I was just unique\n\nWe decided we gon' let these digits speak\n\nThen we turn Slauson into Venice Beach\n\nS 600 Maybach, platinum dealer plates\n\nWake up in this penthouse to the cityscape\n\nYou know it's authentic, every shit I say\n\nI knew self destruction ain't the only way\n\nSometimes perfect timing feels like I'm too late\n\nBut I know you're still great in spite of your mistakes\n\nBefore you run your race you gotta find a pace\n\nJust make sure you cross the line and fuck the time it takes\n\nI got out the county jail 2008\n\nCouple months I dropped the tape then I was on my way\n\nMy first single out it set the streets ablaze\n\nOn location shot that video in front the cage\n\nTryna find my way through this fuckin' maze\n\nEvery concert, hundred niggas on the stage\n\nI'm still active so it's really just another day\n\nPromoters paranoid to book you, that affects ya pay\n\nAnd when you stop eatin' that affects your weight\n\nAnd when you get hungry that affects your brain\n\nSee me I'm not trippin' I respect the game\n\nI hope y'all do if I can't make I'm gon' take your chain\n\nSee ain't too many like us, we like vintage Bape\n\nAnd I don't fuck with busters I can't integrate\n\nI know perfect timing feels like I'm too late\n\nBut every single time I drop they tell me I'm the great"
