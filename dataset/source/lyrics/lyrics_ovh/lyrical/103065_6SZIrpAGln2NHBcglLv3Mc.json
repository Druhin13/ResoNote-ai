  "lyrics": "(Tom Petty)\r\nEvery women and every man,\r\nKnows the feeling so well\r\nThose times when the heart just can't understand,\r\nThe times when you never can tell\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\nSo deliver me, deliver me\n\nBaby take this heart, set it free\n\nTake this chance, take this dream\n\nBaby take this heart\n\nDeliver me-\n\n\n\nI was born with something down inside of me\n\nAnd it's carried me over, delivered me\n\nYeah delivered me, I'm standin' at your gate\n\nJust out of reach of the hands of fate\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\n\n\nSometimes I wonder if this is worth the trouble\n\nSometimes I wonder if this is worth the fight\n\nI never have made my mind up about it\n\nI've just decided to let it all ride"
