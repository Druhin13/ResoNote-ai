  "lyrics": "It seems we've stood and talked like this before\r\nWe looked at each other in the same way then\r\nBut I can't remember where or when\r\nThe clothes you are wearing are the clothes you wore\r\nThe smile you are smiling you were smiling then\n\nBut I can't remember where or when\n\n\n\nSome things that happened for the first time\n\nSeem to be happening again\n\n\n\nAnd so it seems that we have met before\n\nAnd laughed before, and loved before\n\nBut who knows where or when"
