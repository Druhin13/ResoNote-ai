  "lyrics": "My first, my last, my everything.\r\nAnd the answer to all my dreams.\r\nYou're my sun, my moon, my guiding star.\r\nMy kind of wonderful, that's what you are\r\nI know there's only, only one like you.\n\nThere's no way, they could have made two\n\nYou're all I'm living for,\n\nYour love I'll keep for evermore,\n\nYou're the first, you're the last, my everything.\n\n\n\nIn you I've found so many things\n\nA love so new only you could bring\n\nCan't you see if you,\n\nYou'll make me feel this way.\n\nYou're like a fresh morning dew on a brand new day.\n\nI see so many way that I\n\ncan love you,Till the day I die.\n\nYou're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream.\n\nYou're the first, the last, my everything\n\n* Instrumental *\n\n\n\nI know there's only, only one like you.\n\nThere's no way they could have made two.\n\nGirl you're my reality\n\nBut I'm lost in a dream\n\nYou're the first, you're the last, my everything"
