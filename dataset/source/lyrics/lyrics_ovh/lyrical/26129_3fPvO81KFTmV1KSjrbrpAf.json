  "lyrics": "Celebratory moments of a glass or a bottle in the air \nOr a flask and a shotti with a flare \nAnd the bag coming out when one appears \nOr the flash of a body in the stairs \nAnd the crash of a lobby in despair, \nOr. moments where you getting patted on the ground \n\nThat then turn into badges on the ground, \n\nAnd the irony of reversing a role where whenever they roll \n\nBet that they know that's whatever for them now, \n\n‘cause now is a scene where a stream is interrupted \n\nBy conclusion jumping and dumping into a seat \n\nWhere a dream is sitting in overdrive so taking over the drive \n\nTurns into 12 acquitting the screams, or 12 acquitting what they believe, \n\nUntil they're in the crowd banking on what another 12 perceives \n\nOr celebratory moments of a scale being off to the left \n\nSo you cop and get more than you expect \n\nAnd the rest goes off to the cost of looking like you're involved \n\nSo you back to spending more with your connect, \n\nConnecting like interlocking the latch \n\nWhen a latch key is cocking it back \n\nKnowing a latch leads to how to react, \n\nAnd the reaction is counter react, \n\nIt gets complicated like confiscating the lottery back, \n\nIt comps a way in like finding a pack, \n\nOr it comps a weigh in like you was conned into buying it back, \n\nBack tracking to the moments that inspired the toast, \n\nTo the half gallon of Henny for supplying you hope, \n\nTil you're back to backing the semi from inside of your coat, \n\nEither that, or standing on the other side of the scope, \n\nOr, it's a celebration of being nowhere near where that aim is, \n\nTrigger fingers turn to quotations, \n\nSame fingers boxing you in will leave you vacant, \n\nRound of applause down the hall for all your patience, \n\nOr you in a hall, up on the wall, \n\nWith department of corrections letters hovered up over where your name is, \n\nOr you by the door, cap and gown to the floor, \n\n8 years of proof hovered up over where your name sits, \n\nDraw you to the crown, they sell it to you as weightless \n\nAnd charge you to sit on their wait list, \n\nThen you fast forward, private parking the Porsche, open the doors \n\nTo a round of applause down the hall from all your patients, \n\nFists in the air over mistakes, or fists in the air over the jakes \n\nBeing vision impaired holding a tre, \n\nAnd that tre pound lift up the fear from out his face \n\nAnd you vision impaired over a wake, \n\nFor the face that the jakes pinned as being a nigga \n\nSo he gives him everything that he thinks a nigga should take, \n\nAnd you ask him how he spell it and he responds \n\n\"please make up your mind, you niggers is either niggers or you ain’t”, \n\nAll black everything, Bobby Seale fit with a tre \n\nWhile I'm untwisting my chains, \n\nCelebratory moments of a glass or a bottle in the air \n\nOr a flask and a shotti with a flare \n\nAnd the bag coming out when one appears \n\nOr the flash of a body in the stairs \n\nAnd the crash of a lobby in despair, \n\nRecalled by the store til the morn' while you borrowing a square \n\nAnd they're watching what you hear, but everybody's fine..."
