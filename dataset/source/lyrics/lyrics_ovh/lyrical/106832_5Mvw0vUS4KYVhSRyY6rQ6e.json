  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\r\nHow bout them bullets ain't slow you up\r\nYou ain't really die, we watched you grow up\r\nAt 12 months you took your first steps\r\nAwkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best\r\nYour first breaths that we can call words\n\nIn your father's lap on November 23rd\n\nThey were \"live for me\", and he did for you\n\nFlipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you\n\nAnd this commitment from your father\n\nImparted a deep sense of value you forever harbor\n\nAnd we were all so proud as we seen you getting smarter\n\nAnd bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter\n\nYou were not a martyr\n\n\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nAt six, you started reading whole books\n\nAt seven, you knew how a brain looked\n\nAnd could roughly describe, all the different regions\n\nCould tell when we was sick and even knew the reason\n\nThe world wasn't at peace, gunfire every weekend\n\nBut you were hardly there, cause you was always leaving\n\nField museum planetarium aquarium\n\nYou saw something special in that tank you were starin' in\n\nAnd those moments as a little girl\n\nYou realized it was a bigger world\n\nBigger than the South Side, bigger than Chicago\n\nYou were bigger still wanted rims on your car, though\n\nAnd big ass woofers in your car door\n\nSo you could wang like your daddy at the park eating sharks\n\nWent to King where you were teased for being smart\n\nWhere you bumped into Hadiya teaching art\n\nYou live forever\n\n\n\n[Verse 3]\n\nAt sixteen is when you got your scholarship\n\nAt twenty-two is when you got your doctorate\n\nEven now it's kind of hard to believe\n\nBut your father taught you work hard, and achieve\n\nAnd you complied, accepted by every medical school you applied\n\nBut the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot\n\nYou replied: \"they need me in the hood\" and that's where you reside\n\nFree clinic, nobody denied\n\nAnd that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside\n\nAnd saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands\n\nFading fast, but you knew she could survive\n\nDid everything you could to keep this girl alive\n\nStabilized until the ambulance arrived\n\nAnd in that moment, where you gave your help\n\nI bet you didn't know that you saved yourself"
