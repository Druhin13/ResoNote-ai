  "lyrics": "Take yourself apart from me\r\nDown into a flame\r\nYou're everything one could keep\r\nYou're worn with every face\r\nRapping like a scarecrow's wings, you unwind\n\nI'm thrown to a seamless wave\n\nAnd it's written on a sea of love\n\nAnd It's all I can leave you babe\n\n'Cause the world was never yours\n\nI just keep playing that restless haunt\n\nNothing I can change\n\n\n\nSwallow what's still brave in you\n\nLike metal in your jaw\n\nTrying not to melt away\n\nBeginning to unthaw\n\n\n\nDead flag, ship of fools you command\n\nI'm trying not to wither away\n\nAnd I'm wondering if I'll feel the grace\n\nI'm trying to unlove this world\n\nBut it has no other place\n\nI just keep playing that empty hand\n\nNothing I can cheat\n\n\n\nCan you touch\n\nCan you stay\n\nWould you weep, for the day\n\nYou knew when your eyes closed\n\nBut you knew when your eyes closed\n\nCan you want\n\nCan you stay\n\nWould you reach, around me\n\n\n\nLight another melody\n\nAnd drown into the sound\n\nI've buried every living thing\n\nDeeper than the ground"
