  "lyrics": "You cannot have the crown without the cross\r\nI'm talkin about somewhere in your life there is a cross\r\nThat drives you to the Father\r\nLadies and gentlemen\r\nI know, I know that it's coming\r\nA blessing is coming my way, yeah\n\nNot comin in houses\n\nWorth more than silver and gold, yeah\n\nI rather have you in my soul\n\nEven when the world thinks it's a joke\n\nChurches talkin' holy, but no ghost\n\nPeople dyin', steady losing hope\n\nTell me"
