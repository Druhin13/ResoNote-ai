  "title": "A Fine Romance",
  "lyrics": "A fine romance, with no kisses\r\nA fine romance, my friend this is\r\nWe should be like a couple of hot tomatoes\r\nBut you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes\r\nA fine romance, you won't nestle\r\nA fine romance, you won't wrestle\n\nI might as well play bridge\n\nWith my old maid aunt\n\nI haven't got a chance\n\nThis is a fine romance\n\n\n\nA fine romance, my good fellow\n\nYou take romance, I'll take jello\n\nYou're calmer than the seals\n\nIn the Arctic Ocean\n\nAt least they flap their fins\n\nTo express emotion\n\nA fine romance with no quarrels\n\nWith no insults and all morals\n\nI've never mussed the crease\n\nIn your blue serge pants\n\nI never get the chance\n\nThis is a fine romance"
