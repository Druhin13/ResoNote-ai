  "lyrics": "Peace\r\nLadies and gentlemen\r\nStanding before you with something important to say\r\nWith some trepidation I crave your attention but\r\nI'm not gonna let anything get in my way\n\nThe message is simple, it's straight from my heart\n\nAnd I know that you've heard it before\n\nBut what does it matter, we're in it together\n\nAnd I'm not quitting while people are crying for more\n\n\n\nPeople want peace\n\nPeople want peace\n\nA simple release from their suffering\n\nPeople want peace\n\nPeople want peace\n\n\n\nNothing in life is as sad as the lonely, so\n\nSearching for peace\n\nOnly to find disappointment is waiting\n\nBehind every door that we open\n\nEvery catch, we release\n\nA-brothers and sisters, I beg you to listen\n\nI know that it isn't too late\n\nFor we as the people, the voices of freedom\n\nAnd we're all perfectly clear that we don't wanna wait\n\n\n\nPeople want peace\n\nPeople want peace\n\nA simple release from their suffering\n\nPeople want peace\n\nPeople want peace\n\n\n\nPeople want peace\n\nPeople want peace\n\nYes, we want peace!\n\nPeople want peace\n\nPeople want peace"
