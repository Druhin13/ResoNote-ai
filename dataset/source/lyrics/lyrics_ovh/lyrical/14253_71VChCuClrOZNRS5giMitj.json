  "lyrics": "My girl if you're lucky one day\r\nRolling down the ancient high street you'll find\r\nIn the mirror reflects a woman in her prime\r\nCan you make your way out?\r\nIn a world dearly won\r\nWell it's yours love\n\nYou can move it around\n\nGiven all the drops in the ocean\n\nBetter take it one sip at a time\n\nSomebody with an antique notion\n\nCome along to tighten the line\n\nThey're just afraid of you speaking your mind\n\n\n\nThey've got a name for you girls\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nThey got a name for everything\n\nAll of the clothes that you wear\n\nAnd all of your bits and pieces yeah\n\n\n\nYou're flipping through the check-stand rags it appears\n\nThere ain't no time to waste, you're getting on in years\n\nYou can keep your can up\n\nIf you just never eat again\n\nIt's a means to a terrible end\n\nEven if your plan is successful\n\nHave you really got room in your life?\n\nYeah and it's a bland kind of torture\n\nYou've played the mother and wife\n\nBut what do you really dream of at night?\n\n\n\nThey've got a name for you girls\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nThey've got a name for you girls\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nThey got a name for everything\n\nAll of the clothes that you wear\n\nAnd all of your bits and pieces yeah\n\n\n\nThey've got a name for you girls\n\nSome stupid name\n\nThey've got a name for you girls\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nWhat's in a name?"
