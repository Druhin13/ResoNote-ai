  "lyrics": "(Clark, Collen, Elliott, Lange, Savage)\r\nOhhhh...Oooooh... \nI don't wanna play \nThe wailting game \nAnd drift away \n\nLeavin' an illusion \n\nI don't wanna hide \n\nIt's foolish pride \n\nTo close my eyes \n\nA touch away from wanting you \n\n\n\nDon't try to look away \n\nWhen we're face to face \n\nI see your eyes \n\nThat animal emotion \n\nYou don't have to set \n\nYour tender trap \n\nIt's in those eyes \n\nIt's gonna happen anyway \n\n\n\n(Movin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat) \n\nYeah, I'm wantin', willin', touchin' you \n\nWe'll be \n\n(Movin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat) \n\nOoh babe \n\nWhen you get that rhythm \n\nGonna move into your room \n\n\n\nTonight - Gimme love with no disguise \n\nTonight - I see the fire in your eyes \n\nTonight - So right, this night could be dynamite \n\nWait'n'see \n\nIf it pleases you it pleases me \n\n\n\nThere's nothing I can say \n\nNo mystery \n\nIt's in your eyes \n\nThose eyes are where I wanted them \n\nSo give me heart'n'soul \n\nI lose control \n\nCan't stop my eyes \n\nFrom fallin' into fantasy \n\n\n\nRepeat Bridge \n\nRepeat Chorus \n\n\n\nTonight - Gimme love with no disguise \n\nTonight - I see the fire in your eyes \n\nTonight - I wanna win the greatest prize \n\nTonight - So right, this night could be dynamite \n\nWait'n'see \n\nIf it pleases you it pleases me"
