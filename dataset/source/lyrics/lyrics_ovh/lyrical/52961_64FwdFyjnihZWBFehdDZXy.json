  "lyrics": "I'm the devil that you know\r\nBaby, I know what you want\r\nI know you ask for miracles\r\nYou people are good at that\r\nYou're waiting for the man\n\nTo pull a rabbit from his hat\n\nBut I can get you off\n\nYeah, bad boys are an aphrodisiac\n\nI promise baby, that I can be anything you want\n\nI'm the devil that you know\n\nOr the devil that you don't\n\n\n\nYou all like the familiar\n\nYou all like the routine\n\nYou all wish you knew what you know\n\nAnd still be seventeen\n\nI had a talk with Jesus\n\nI said, \"Man, you're just part of the machine\"\n\nHe unfriended me on Facebook\n\nI said, \"oh, no you don't\"\n\nI'm the devil that you know\n\nBaby, I know what you want\n\n\n\nNow, people loosen up\n\nHe may have loved you once\n\nBut why you think God quit\n\nPerforming all his stunts?\n\nYou like the burning bush\n\nHis badass victors on the battlefronts\n\n\n\nWhere's that angry guy smitin'\n\nHeathens and sending plagues?\n\nGod has left the building\n\nYou can raise the barricades\n\nSing it for me, baby\n\nSing your solemn song\n\n\n\nListen to me\n\nEverything you do and say is wrong\n\nYour very best interest at heart\n\nYou know I've had them all along\n\nEveryone gets nervous\n\nWhen they face the great unknown\n\nDo you want the devil that you know\n\nOr the devil that you don't?\n\n\n\nI used to like you better\n\nWhen you had that diamond smile\n\nYou close your knees, tossed the keys\n\nAnd joined the rank and file\n\nYour pretty pink Ferrari\n\nDon't give joy rides in exile\n\nCome back to me, baby\n\nJust lose that chaperone\n\nI'm the devil that you know\n\nNot the devil that you don't\n\n\n\nYou're looking up to heaven\n\nDreaming on a star\n\nYou can't reach it, baby\n\nNot from where you are\n\nYou stopped drinking double bloody mary's\n\nAt the airport bar\n\nYou're scared to make a move\n\nIt's so not what you want\n\nYou're caught between the devil that you know\n\nAnd the devil that you don't!"
