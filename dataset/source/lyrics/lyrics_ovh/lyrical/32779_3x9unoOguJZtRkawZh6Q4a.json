  "lyrics": "I'm living with the fear of God every single day\r\nI'm living with myself, I know not enough of who I speak\r\nI'm living like the Sheriff man patrolling this dirty boulevard\r\nHey, look, these Aviators, man, they complete [?]\r\nI [?] sometimes\n\nAnd I [?] this time\n\n\n\nThen it comes (comes, comes)\n\nThat same old nagging feeling\n\nI need to do wrong (wrong, wrong)\n\nThe lies I start to believe in\n\n\n\nI'm living with the purest pleasures as my memories\n\nI'm living with the mess, I guess, I never even clean\n\nI'm loving when I slide my hands inside a dirty deck of cards\n\nHey, look, these Aviators, man, they complete [?]\n\n\n\nI [?] sometimes\n\nAnd I [?] this time\n\nI [?] sometimes\n\nAnd I [?] this time\n\n\n\nAnd I know there was a place so long ago\n\nAnd I could go to find faith and beauty\n\nBut nothing that sweet could ever inspire me\n\n[?] guided me\n\n\n\nSo it goes (goes, goes)\n\nThat same old nagging feeling\n\nDo wrong (wrong, wrong)\n\nThe lies I start to believe in\n\n\n\nI'm living with myself, I guess\n\nI'm living with myself, I guess\n\nI'm living with myself, I guess\n\nI'm living with myself, I guess\n\nI'm living with myself, I guess\n\nI'm living with myself, I guess"
