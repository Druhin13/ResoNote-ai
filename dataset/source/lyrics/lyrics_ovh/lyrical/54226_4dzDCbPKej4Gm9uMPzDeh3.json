  "lyrics": "I’m sorry I sometimes say too much\r\nI’m sorry that your love is not enough\r\nI’m sorry if these chains are too tight\r\nI’m sorry I can’t say these words right\r\nBut if you lie with me\n\nI can make you stay\n\nI can wake you from this bad dream\n\nOur love can die another day\n\n\n\nI’m sorry I sometimes think too much\n\nI’m sorry I make you drink too much\n\nI’m sorry you can’t sleep well at night\n\nI’m sorry I can’t tame your wild mind\n\n\n\nBut if you lie with me\n\nI can make you stay\n\nI can wake you from this bad dream\n\nOur love can die another day\n\n\n\nYou can lie to me\n\nTell me that you’ve changed your ways\n\nI can wake you from this bad dream\n\nOur love can die another day\n\n\n\nDown in the 12th round\n\nI can hear the countdown\n\nBut I can’t stand up\n\nI’ll just lay here on the ground\n\n\n\nIf you lie with me\n\nI can make you stay\n\nWe can wake up from this bad dream\n\nOur love can die another day\n\n\n\nBaby lie to me\n\nTell me that you’ve changed your ways\n\nWe can wake up from this bad dream\n\nOur love can die another day\n\n\n\nOh come on wake me from this bad dream\n\nLet me die another day"
