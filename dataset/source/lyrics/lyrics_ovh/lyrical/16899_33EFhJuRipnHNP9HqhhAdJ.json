  "lyrics": "On the kindness of strangers\r\nI've come to depend\r\nFor a shoulder to lean\r\nor a hand to lend\r\nThis world's too hard\r\nto not have someone break my fall\n\nWe climb this world stone by stone\n\nWe love each other bone by bone\n\nThere are sins for which\n\none just cannot atone\n\nThere's a price we pay\n\nfor the places we lay\n\nFor putting it all on the line\n\nSo far down the only sound\n\nIs something leaving you behind\n\nWhat if we end just where we begin\n\nEverywhere we go\n\nwe have already been\n\nWould you relive the pain\n\nOr would you call it a draw\n\nNothing at all\n\nAll or nothing at all"
