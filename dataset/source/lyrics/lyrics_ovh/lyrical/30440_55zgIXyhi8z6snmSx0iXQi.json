  "lyrics": "I'll touch your skin\r\nSay good night and turn in\r\nLights flicker ice cold\r\nBeneath the clouds we'll go\r\nI'll touch your body and soul\n\nAnd dreams where I'm your darling\n\nI'll stumble and pray for more\n\nAnd hear the sirens calling\n\n\n\nI tell my knees I can wait\n\nWhile you're waiting for a lullaby\n\nSay your grace\n\nCount the freckles on your face\n\nAnd remember all your little flaws that make my day\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like air\n\nAnd it feels like air\n\nAnd it feels like air\n\nAnd it feels like air\n\n\n\nI tell my knees I can wait\n\nWhile you're waiting for a lullaby\n\nSay your grace\n\nCount the freckles on your face\n\nAnd remember all your little flaws that make my day"
