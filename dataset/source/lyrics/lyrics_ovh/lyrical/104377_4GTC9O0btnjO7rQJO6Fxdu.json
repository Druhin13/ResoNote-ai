  "lyrics": "The words are getting hard to find\r\nLike friends on Valentines\r\nThe puzzle pieces got lost in time and left behind, but fought a real good fight\r\nBut there's something 'bout you, babe\r\nThough I tried to open up\n\nIt's no use, I'm frozen in the stage\n\nBeing great at pushing everyone I love\n\nI love away\n\n\n\nAnd it's just too little too late to change\n\nI got a heart that's been beaten this way for way too long\n\nI can't stop singing in and outta key\n\nI got a heart that's been bleeding this way for way too long\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nFor way too long\n\n\n\nDespite the look that's in your eyes\n\nI know how hard you tried to break my stubbornness\n\nDo your best to pull me out\n\nBut I'm burried in this mess, I see you're disheartened and\n\n\n\nI really want to give you more\n\nThan just parts of what I can\n\nI wish you could call the last ones\n\nSo you understand\n\n\n\nThat it's just too little too late to change\n\nI got a heart that's been beaten this way for way too long\n\nI can't stop singing in and outta key\n\nI got a heart that's been bleeding this way for way too long\n\n\n\nAnd baby, I'm trying, baby, I'm trying\n\nYou know I been trying for way too long\n\nAnd baby, I'm trying, baby, I'm trying\n\n\n\nBut it's just too little too late to change\n\nI got a heart that's been beaten this way for way too long\n\nI can't stop singing in and outta key\n\nI got a heart that's been bleeding this way for way too long\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, mmm, for way too long\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\nMmm, mmm, for way too long"
