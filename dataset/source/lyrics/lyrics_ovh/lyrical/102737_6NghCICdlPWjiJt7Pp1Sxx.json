I was a king and general\n\nRich in every resource, precious metal and mineral\n\nBefore the devil entered the land of the plentiful\n\nWith that Jamaican funk, gotta get it into who\n\nFor generations under God, indivisible\n\nPsych ward patience, vampires in a interview\n\nBecome institutionalized, what a nigga do\n\nBut what we had to do to survive, none o' them could do\n\nWho the technical culprit, I don't mess with no vultures\n\nI'm electrical voltage, not the regular dosage\n\nToo obsessive compulsive, I'm a fuckin' explosive\n\nMixed message in a bottle, I left with the postman\n\nI'm that arachnophobia, black petroleum\n\nCeremoniously holy when at the podium\n\nEven though it's hotter than weapons-grade plutonium\n\nThe people tryna check for the return of the Ichiban\n\nObi-Wan universe, you owe me one solid\n\nMy homie Gonzalez, only know gun violence\n\nOn the corner where they prob'ly on they 21 Savage\n\nCatch two in your cabbage, Young Cesar Chavez\n\nRevision one, yo, where we get our rhythm from?\n\nContinuum, still swingin' like a pendulum\n\nHere the women come, sing it like Sarah Vaughan\n\nHeard 9th up in a house, from North Carilon'\n\nAin't no mannequin challenge, but y'all paralyzed\n\nIt's gettin' cold outside, a word from the wise\n\nY'all niggas better bundle up but I bet it be a hotter summer\n\nNot for nothin' yo, the cops get down, especially when it come to us\n\nNigga better be a Rockefeller\n\nGet that out your pocket fella, sayin' in acapella\n\nAin't a damn thing really changed as far as I can tell it\n\nAnother soul with no name, the helicopters hunted\n\nLook like a couple of days before the doctor comin'\n\nBut that's my little cousin, watch him for me\n\nI think the world tryna sock it to me\n\nIt kinda feel like everything is out of pocket for me\n\nWho keep it a hundred when everything's partial?\n\nDignity and sanity is what the game cost you\n\nWake up to the paddles on your chest, we had lost you\n\nI'm just paintin' a picture like Kerry James Marshall\n\nI'm just takin' a picture like Carrie Mae Weems\n\nSo smile and say cheese, we in 2018\n\nIn a pyramid scheme, nightmares and day dreams\n\nFrom the runaway slave, to a modern day king"
