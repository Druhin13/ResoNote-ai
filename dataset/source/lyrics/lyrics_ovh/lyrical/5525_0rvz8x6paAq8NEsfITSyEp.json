Yeah\n\n\n\nIt's a good thing I came out alive when I did\n\nAnd it was bad, but I don't got no regret\n\n'Cause you're the good, the good that came out of it\n\nI guess, I guess that now I'm going back to good\n\n\n\nIs it bad to be too good, is it bad\n\nThat you're good, baby, way too good at that\n\nWhat you got, baby, now, I'm not used to that\n\nI'm all good, going back to good, yeah\n\nBack to good, yeah\n\nBa-ba-back to good, yeah\n\nBack to good, yeah\n\nBa-ba-back to good, yeah\n\n\n\n\n\nNo money, it don't do 'nough\n\nThe feelings that I get, I won't discuss, but\n\nIt's different when it comes to us\n\nI'm cool with saying less, than way too much\n\n\n\nYou're fucking up my rubber in the best way\n\nBrought me back to life, but girl, your body's deadly\n\nI want candy and you'll get it good and plenty\n\nDid you hear me? Yeah\n\n\n\nIt's a good thing I came out of love when I did\n\nAnd it was bad, but I know that, no regret\n\n'Cause you're the good, the good that came out of it\n\nI guess, I guess that now I'm going back to good\n\n\n\nIs it bad to be too good, is it bad\n\nThat you're good, baby, way too good at that\n\nWhat you got, baby, now, I'm not used to that\n\nI'm all good, going back to good, yeah\n\nBack to good, yeah\n\nBa-ba-back to good, yeah\n\nBack to good, yeah\n\nBa-ba-back to good, yeah\n\n\n\n\n\nWho better, who better to know?\n\nThe good and the bad 'cause I've done it all before\n\nWho better, who better to know?\n\n\n\nIt's a good thing I came out of love when I did\n\nAnd it was bad, but I know that, no regret\n\n'Cause you're the good, the good that came out of it\n\nI guess, I guess that now I'm going back to good\n\n\n\nIs it bad to be too good, is it bad\n\nThat you're good, baby, way too good at that\n\nWhat you got, baby, now, I'm not used to that\n\nI'm all good, going back to good, yeah"
