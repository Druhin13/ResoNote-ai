  "lyrics": "And though I never got her name\r\nOr time to find out anything\r\nI loved her just the same\r\nAnd though I rode a different road\r\nAnd sang a different song\r\nI'll love her till my last breaths gone\n\nLike a river made of silver\n\nEveryone came running to the scene\n\nI was shot down in cold blood\n\nBy an angel in blue jeans\n\n\n\nLate that night she got away\n\nI chased her to the turnpike\n\nThen lost her where the music never plays\n\nAnd though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water\n\nI'll love her till my judgment day\n\nLike a sunrise made of white lies\n\nEverything was nothing as it seems\n\nI was shot down in cold blood\n\nBy an angel in blue jeans\n\n\n\nI hear voices calling all around\n\nI keep falling down\n\nI think my heart could pound right out of me\n\nI see a million different ways\n\nTo never leave this maze alive\n\n\n\nI woke up in somebody's arms\n\nStrange and so familiar\n\nWhere nothing could go wrong\n\nBarely alive or nearly dead\n\nSomehow awake in my own bed\n\nAnd there you are\n\nLike a highway headed my way\n\nLife is but a dream\n\nI was shot down by your love\n\nMy angel in blue jeans"
