  "lyrics": "He never knew his father, the only home he had was the block\r\nCrack in the sock, just a rebel with a hand full of rocks\r\nCadillac on D's just like Pamela Anderson's top\r\nHad to have a [?] to fill a void from not having a pops\r\nSee, his old man was a dope head, never had J's, just PRO-Keds\r\nMother worked all kind of jobs, broke her back tryna provide\n\nBut the local smack dealers outside who he idolized\n\nWhen they bang, the disciple signs light up the night like fireflies\n\nHe wanna be them, so he gotta be in, anything to numb the pain\n\nOnly 12, serving fiends, soaking in the pouring rain\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that we can face this together\n\nAny city, every weather\n\nIn the line and in the pouring rain, in the pouring rain, oh\n\nAnd I hope that we can face this together\n\nAny city, every weather\n\nIn the line and in the pouring rain, in the pouring rain, oh\n\n\n\nHe never knew his son, how to be a man and teach it to his son\n\nHe ain't have a father, that shit come back like karma\n\nHe ain't have a job or income tax, he barely knew his mama\n\nShe was 16 when her water broke\n\nTryna get a start of coke, not start a family\n\nHe never had a plan or a plan B\n\nHe was sent overseas to fight Afghanis\n\nAnd came home addicted to the candy\n\nHow could you champion a child\n\nWhen you trampled to the ground?\n\nGotta have it, you can't navigate around with a GPS\n\nHe seen a shorty standing at the CVS\n\nHe knew he had work, he seen it in his eye like CBS\n\nHe walked up to him, shorty said, \"What you want?\"\n\nThat's when he realized he was buying crack from his own son\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that we can face this together\n\nAny city, every weather\n\nIn the line and in the pouring rain, in the pouring rain, oh\n\nAnd I hope that we can face this together\n\nAny city, every weather\n\nIn the line and in the pouring rain, in the pouring rain, oh"
