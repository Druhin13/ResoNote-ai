  "lyrics": "And we were bold\r\nOver the world\r\nWe were flying through the satellites\r\nWe had ahold\r\nOf the lightning strikes\r\nWhen we should have been afraid of heights\n\nAnd I was trying just to get you\n\nAnd now I'm dying to forget you\n\nCause I knew I couldn't catch you\n\nSo I left the sky\n\nAnd I fell behind\n\n\n\nWe were one in the same\n\nRunning like moths to the flame\n\nYou'd hang on every word I'd say\n\nBut now they only ricochet\n\nWe were falling away\n\nYou left me with a bittersweet taste\n\nBut when I send my heart your way\n\nIt bounces off the walls you made\n\nRicochet\n\n\n\nIf I was whole\n\nI'd turn right now\n\nI'd forget it and just walk away\n\nCause I've been told\n\nThat I'm dragging it out\n\nBut I've been dying just to see your face\n\nAnd all I wanted was to say \"goodbye\"\n\nInto the fortress that you're stuck behind\n\nAnd in the silence now I realize\n\nThat after all I built the wall\n\n\n\nWe were one in the same\n\nRunning like moths to the flame\n\nYou'd hang on every word I'd say\n\nBut now they only ricochet\n\nYou were falling away\n\nYou left me with a bittersweet taste\n\nBut when I send my heart your way\n\nIt bounces off the walls you made\n\nRicochet\n\n\n\nAll these broken souls\n\nThey never make me whole\n\nThey don't, they don't know my heart\n\nThey don't know my heart\n\nAll these broken souls\n\nEach one more beautiful\n\nThey don't, they don't know my heart\n\nThey don't know my heart\n\nI'll send out my soul\n\nTo worlds more beautiful\n\nBut they won't, they won't know my heart\n\nIt's the darkest part\n\n\n\nWe were one in the same\n\nRunning like moths to the flame\n\nYou'd hang on every word I'd say\n\nBut now they only ricochet\n\nYou were falling away\n\nYou left me with a bittersweet taste\n\nBut when I send my heart your way\n\nIt bounces off the walls you made\n\nRicochet"
