  "lyrics": "Forgive me my folly I know not my heart\r\nI've reached out to find it in vain\r\nI've wandered away, I've broken apart\r\nBut I will be home once again\r\nOh brothers oh sisters what that you may hear\n\nLet no one look down on your age\n\nOh mothers oh fathers speak not from your fear\n\nYou were once were as young and as brave\n\n\n\nNow hold your hands up to the fire\n\nFeel as the years burn away\n\nOh do not go quiet the end to the dark\n\nAgainst the cold night you must rage\n\n\n\nOh justice comes swift as a thief in the night\n\nAnd apathy lay down you head\n\nOh mercy be swayed as the fruit on the vine\n\nAnd drink from the well once again\n\n\n\nNow hold your hands up to the fire\n\nBe never be more eager to blame\n\nAnd do not go quiet the end to the dark\n\nAgainst the cold night you must rage\n\n\n\nNow hold your hands up to the fire\n\nAnd never more revel in shame\n\nAnd do not go quiet the end to the dark\n\nAgainst the cold night you must rage\n\nOh do not go quiet the end to the dark\n\nAgainst the cold night you must rage\n\nYeah do not go quiet the end to the dark\n\nAgainst the cold night you must rage"
