  "lyrics": "Drove the night, 7 hours straight\r\nSaw the sun rise up, over the Golden Gate\r\nYou and me run forever\r\nYou and me stay together\r\nTore out a page from a book I read\n\nTurned a Chevrolet into a king-sized bed\n\nYou and me know no better\n\nYou and me know, oh\n\n\n\nThat trouble's gonna find us no matter where we go, whoah\n\nTrouble's right behind us no matter where we go, whoah\n\n\n\nSpell out your name on the windowsill\n\nAt the break of dawn when the world is still\n\nThe sound of nothing around us\n\nWe let the ocean surround us\n\n\n\nWind down the road, far [?]\n\nCan't find the words they don't want to say\n\nYou and me rode forever\n\nYou and me rode, oh but\n\n\n\nTrouble's gonna find us no matter where we go, whoah\n\nTrouble's right behind us no matter where we go, whoah\n\nWhoah, whoah\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, trouble's gonna find us no matter where we go, whoah\n\nTrouble's right behind us no matter where we go\n\nOh, trouble's gonna find us no matter where we go, whoah, whoah\n\nTrouble's right behind us no matter where we go, whoah"
