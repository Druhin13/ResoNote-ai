I keep asking myself.\n\n\n\nNothing like this has ever happened to me ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover running through my head.\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover; I can see her in my head.\n\n\n\nPerfect lover. Lover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey keep telling you -- they keep telling you, it's just a fascination.\n\n\n\nWhy don't they listen -- no one listens to what I am sayin'!\n\n\n\nAnd everyone tells you she just isn't there, that it just couldn't be.\n\n\n\nIf only they knew how real she is to me ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover running through my head.\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover; I can see her in my head.\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover running through my head.\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover; I can see her in my head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes I hear the cry, (I hear it crying out)\n\n\n\nYour voice from deep inside. (inside, inside, inside ...)\n\n\n\nThey're stealing you from me ...\n\n\n\nEver be ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not looking through the eyes of a desperate stranger.\n\n\n\nWhat I envision is so real, I don't want to change her.\n\n\n\nAnd sometimes I feel like she's standing right there,\n\n\n\nLike I could reach out and touch her.\n\n\n\n\u0000nly I know how real she is to me ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover running through my head.\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover; I can see you in my head.\n\n\n\nThere's a perfect lover running through my head.\n\n\n\nPerfect lover. Lover."
