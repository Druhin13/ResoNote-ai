  "lyrics": "Wait just a little bit longer\r\nBefore you stab me in the back and walk away\r\n‘Cause I’ve grown a little bit stronger\r\nAnd now you’re choking on those deadly words you ate\r\nI can’t wait to watch you fall\r\nLike the castle you built on sand\n\n\n\nI won’t let you live my life from inside my head now\n\nLet you out, it’s hard to pretend how\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes\n\nYour heart is black and mine is gold\n\nMake my way to places I’m bound for\n\nDon’t you say that you wanted this more\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes\n\nYour heart is black and mine is gold\n\n\n\nTake all the time that you asked for\n\n‘Cause I can see the lack of energy in your eyes\n\nI’m walking out through the back door\n\n‘Cause there’s no point to waste away these days inside\n\nI’m learning how you’re burning down\n\nAll the bridges you built by hand\n\n\n\nI won’t let you live my life from inside my head now\n\nLet you out, it’s hard to pretend how\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes\n\nYour heart is black and mine is gold\n\nMake my way to places I’m bound for\n\nDon’t you say that you wanted this more\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes\n\nYour heart is black and mine is gold\n\n\n\nI won’t let you live my life from inside my head now\n\nLet you out, it’s hard to pretend how\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes\n\nYour heart is black and mine is gold\n\nMake my way to places I’m bound for\n\nDon’t you say that you wanted this more\n\nOn, and on, and on it goes\n\nYour heart is black and mine is gold"
