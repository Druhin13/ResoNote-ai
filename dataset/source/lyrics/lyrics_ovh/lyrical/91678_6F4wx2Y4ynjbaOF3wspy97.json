  "lyrics": "Conversation don't come easy\r\nBut I've got a lot to say\r\nIf you look at what we once had\r\nWell, it feels many moons away\r\nBut I came for you\n\nI've dreamt names for you\n\nIt's true\n\nNo one makes me high like you do\n\nAnd I craved for you\n\nI lost sleep with you\n\nWho knew?\n\nNo one loves me quite like you do\n\n\n\nRead me wrong, you won't be the first\n\nAnd sure as hell not the last\n\nNo one told us this was easy\n\nWe felt like it should've been\n\n\n\nBut I came for you\n\nI've dreamt names for you\n\nIt's true\n\nNo one lets me down like you do\n\nAnd I craved for you\n\nI lost sleep with you\n\nWho knew?\n\nNo one loves me quite like you do\n\nBut no one lets me down like you do\n\n\n\nAnd this is your last chance\n\nTo figure it out\n\n\n\nThat I came for you\n\nAnd I've dreamt names for you\n\nIt's true\n\nNo one makes me high like you do\n\nAnd I craved for you\n\nI lost sleep with you\n\nWho knew?\n\nNo one loves me quite like you do\n\nBut no one lets me down like you do"
