  "lyrics": "Just a boy looking some peace of mind.\r\nJust need a sec to catch my breath.\r\nStill the fool reaching for a cosmic sign.\r\nSomething to make sense of this mess.\r\nYeah, I fell asleep against the window dreaming about Alaska\n\nAnd I woke up as the sun went on over Omaha, Nebraska\n\nAnd I don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been.\n\n\n\nJust a boy living off this borrowed time.\n\nJust give me a sec to catch my breath.\n\nStill the fool waiting for a cosmic sign\n\nSomething to make sense of this mess.\n\n\n\nBut I drank too much in Tuscan and I smoked too much in Denver.\n\nI slept beneath the Northern Lights and I never felt better.\n\nAnd I don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been.\n\n\n\nWell I took a Greyhound bus from Texas to Louisiana\n\nand I chased a girl I barely knew all the way to Atlanta\n\nAnd I've seen a million people scream and shout about the air. [?]\n\nBut I don't know where I'm going, but I know where I've been.\n\n\n\nJust a boy looking some peace of mind.\n\nJust need a sec to catch my breath.\n\nStill the fool reaching for a cosmic sign.\n\nSomething to make sense of this mess."
