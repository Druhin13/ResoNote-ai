  "lyrics": "(I never shed a tear for you)\r\nWe never were in love\r\nThere never were stars above\r\nOn the night when I never said \"I do\"\r\nYou never wore my ring\n\nAnd you never meant a thing\n\nAnd I never shed a tear for you\n\n\n\nIt's not hard to realize\n\nWhen you look into my eyes\n\nThat the truth is, this is how I make it through\n\nYou never broke my heart\n\nAnd I never fell apart\n\nAnd I never shed a tear for you\n\n\n\n(I never shed a tear for you)\n\n\n\nIf I really love you so\n\nThen everyone would know\n\nThat inside, this is tearing me in two\n\nYou never broke my pride\n\nAnd I never died inside\n\nAnd I never shed a tear for you"
