  "lyrics": "Your face, your style, your kiss, your smile\nAll the puzzle pieces i've been missing\nNo man alive could walk on by\nWon't even try it\n'Cause there's no resisting you\n\n\nYou've been a long time coming around\n\nThought i was lost but now i'm found\n\nYou're like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle\n\nI've been waiting for all my life\n\n\n\nBaby you make it better\n\nNow my cinderella's got the slipper that fits\n\nAnd i know this is it\n\n'Cause this jigsaw sure looks right\n\n\n\nTo think that i could ever find\n\nAnyone better baby who am i fooling?\n\nI missed all the signs, blew so much time\n\nI only found you when i stopped looking\n\n\n\nYou've been a long time coming around\n\nThought i was lost but now i'm found\n\nYou're like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle\n\nI've been waiting for all my life\n\n\n\nBaby you make it better\n\nNow my cinderella's got the slipper that fits\n\nAnd i know this is it\n\n'Cause this jigsaw sure looks right\n\n\n\nAnd even though sunshine fades\n\nThere's nobody could ever take your place\n\n\n\nYou're like the final piece of the jigsaw puzzle\n\nI've been waiting for all my life\n\n\n\nBaby you make it better\n\nNow my cinderella's got the slipper that fits\n\nAnd i know this is it\n\n'Cause this jigsaw sure looks right."
