  "lyrics": "All of the wind that I thought I wanted\r\nTo run away, out of my soul\r\nFinally drags me, finally saves me\r\nRight in time my heart can feel you next to me\r\nLook and you’ll see that love is so cruel\n\nBut you came to stay and take control\n\nYou finally embrace me, you finally save me\n\nRight in time my eyes can see you next to me, next to me\n\n\n\nNo river is wilder than my philosophy\n\nHold me that I’ll be a shelter for you\n\nI won’t let you down again\n\nBecause the truth is what I give them back to see\n\nYour laugh I need\n\nPromise me to be the promise that I need\n\n\n\nAll of the winds that I thought were bounded\n\n(all of the winds, all of the winds)\n\nThat threw away my whole damn world\n\nFinally fly me and finally save me (finally save me)\n\nRight in time my heart can feel you next to me\n\nJust next to me\n\n\n\nNo river is wilder than my philosophy\n\nCatch me then I’ll be a shelter for you\n\nI’ll let the dream come true\n\nBecause the truth is what I need them back to see\n\nYour laugh I need\n\n\n\nNo river is wilder\n\nNo reason is righter\n\nI won’t let you down again\n\nBecause the truth is what I give them back to see\n\nYour laugh I need\n\nPromise me to be the promise that I need\n\n\n\nAll of the love that I though I missed out\n\nHas found its way to warm the cold\n\nFinally wants me, finally saves me\n\nRight in time my soul will love you eternally"
