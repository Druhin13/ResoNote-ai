  "lyrics": "The other woman finds time to manicure her nails\r\nThe other woman is perfect where her rival fails\r\nAnd she's never seen with pin curls in her hair\r\nThe other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume\r\nThe other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room\n\nThere are never toys that's scattered everywhere\n\n\n\nAnd when her man comes to call\n\nHe'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen\n\nCause when she's by his side\n\nIt's such a change from old routine\n\n\n\nBut the other woman will always cry herself to sleep\n\nThe other woman will never have his love to keep\n\nAnd as the years go by the other woman will spend her life alone\n\n\n\nBut the other woman will always cry herself to sleep\n\nThe other woman will never have his love to keep\n\nAnd as the years go by the other woman will spend her life alone"
