  "lyrics": "And maybe my god\r\nHas a trot in her walk\r\nAnd her coach bags are knock-off\r\nHer shoes are all dressed up\r\nAnd she spins me around like a marionette\r\nOh my web is still spinning\n\nMy web is still spinning\n\nMy web is still spinning\n\nYou can't see it yet\n\n\n\nOr maybe my god\n\nHas thick hips and big lips\n\nAnd the buttons she's pressing\n\nShe speaks every language\n\nShift A, right B, Nintendo 63\n\nOn her video, baby\n\nThe game she's been changing\n\n\n\nWhen you're drunk near a sunset\n\nLook straight in her eyes\n\nShe's a quick glimpse of heaven\n\nForgetting her headlights are on\n\nWhen you misread her fortune\n\nDon't misread the joke\n\nShe's the note on your lampshade\n\nThe honeycomb holding you\n\n\n\nAnd she spins me around like a marionette\n\nOh my web is still spinning\n\nMy web is still spinning\n\nMy web is still spinning\n\nYou can't see it yet"
