It’s been too long\n\nI still feel like we gave up too soon\n\nYou packed up all your things and walked\n\nBut you left something in my bedroom\n\n\n\nAnd you, you're treating me so cold\n\nLike someone you don't know\n\nAnd ooh, I can’t just let you go\n\nI thought I'd let you know\n\n\n\nI still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nRight there in the corner, teasing me\n\nI still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nAll they do is bring back memories\n\nNo, I can't get you out of my, get you out of my head\n\nI can't just walk away and erase the nights that we spent\n\nWhen I still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nRight there in the corner, teasing me\n\n\n\nWishing we could hit rewind, ah yeah\n\nBefore we said we needed some space\n\nI wonder if I cross your mind\n\nI should have left something at your place, yeah\n\n\n\n'Cause you, you're treating me so cold\n\nLike someone you don't know\n\nAnd ooh, I can't just let you go (You go)\n\nI thought I’d let you know\n\n\n\nI still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nRight there in the corner, teasing me\n\nI still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nAll they do is bring back memories\n\nNo, I can’t get you out of my\n\nGet you out of my head (Out of my head)\n\nI can't just walk away and erase the nights that we spent\n\nWhen I still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nRight there in the corner, teasing me\n\n\n\nEven though I know you’re gone\n\nSomething keeps me holding on\n\nEven though I know you're gone (You're gone)\n\nSomething keeps me holding on\n\n\n\nYeah, I still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nRight there in the corner, teasing me\n\nI still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nAll they do is bring back memories\n\nNo, I can't get you out of my\n\nGet you out of my head (Out of my head)\n\nI can’t just walk away, and face the nights that we spent\n\nWhen I still got your Nikes laying in my closet\n\nRight there in the corner, teasing me\n\n\n\nEven though I know you're gone\n\n(Even though you're gone, even though you're gone)\n\nSomething keeps me holding on\n\n(I keep holding on, I keep holding on)\n\nEven though I know you're gone\n\n(Even though you're gone, even though you're gone)\n\nSomething keeps me holding on\n\n(I keep holding on, I keep holding on)"
