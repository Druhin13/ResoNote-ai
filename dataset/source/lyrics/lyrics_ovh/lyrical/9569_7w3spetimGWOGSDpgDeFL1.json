  "lyrics": "And so the winter dies with a blast of icy wind\r\nLike a mournful cry, it's giving up the ghost again\r\nAnother sheet of snow melts away to gold and green\r\nLook at Peter go, he's racing to the tomb to see\r\nWhere has my Jesus gone?\n\nHe is not dead, He is risen\n\nRisen indeed\n\n\n\nAnd now the flowers bloom like a song of freedom\n\nBehold the earth is new, if only for the season\n\nAnd so the seed that died for You becomes a seedling\n\nJust put your hand into the wound that bought your healing\n\n\n\nAnd let your heart believe\n\nHe is not dead, He is risen\n\nRisen indeed\n\n\n\nAnd the rain will fall on the furrow\n\nIt immerses the earth in sorrow\n\nMary, the sun will rise again\n\nMary, the sun will rise again\n\nDaughter, listen, listen\n\nDaughter listen, He speaks your name\n\n\n\nAnd Father Abraham could not have dreamed of this\n\nCould never understand the end of all those promises\n\nHow all the pieces fit, every star and grain of sand\n\nIs safely hid in Jesus' hand\n\n\n\nLet every tongue confess\n\nHe is not dead, He is risen, risen\n\nHe is not dead, He is risen\n\nRisen indeed\n\n\n\nOh Mary, the sun will rise again\n\nMary, the sun will rise again\n\nDaughter, listen, listen\n\nDaughter listen, He speaks your name"
