  "lyrics": "We can runaway\r\nBut we can't hide for long\r\nAnd all that lingers harms us\r\nI can lie to you\r\nBut the truth comes alive\r\nEvery time I die\n\nSaying goodbye\n\n\n\n'Cause I don't want to change\n\nAnd I can't stay this way\n\nAnd I don't even mind staying chained\n\nAnd thinking of you\n\nThinking of you\n\n\n\nIs it up to me?\n\nIt's always been up to you\n\nTo find the peace we needed to\n\nIs it said and done\n\nIs it carved in the stone\n\nAnd how many days is it gonna take\n\n'Til we get back home\n\n\n\n'Cause I don't want to change\n\nAnd I can't stay this way\n\nAnd I don't even mind staying chained\n\nAnd thinking of you\n\nThinking of you\n\n\n\nWill you wake me up\n\nWill you shake me up\n\n'Cause I'm losing my way in the game\n\nEven at our best, my love\n\nNeither one of us was every be good enough\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know why I can't change\n\nAnd I will always stay this way\n\nAnd I don't even mind staying chained\n\nAnd thinking of you\n\nThinking of you"
