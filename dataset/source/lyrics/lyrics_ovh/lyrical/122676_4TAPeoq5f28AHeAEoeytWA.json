Some bad behavior?\r\nOr you could cash it all in, I suppose\r\nBecause you're in deep, resisting repeats\n\nFace forward and don't come unhinged\n\nI've got the actors and all these bastards\n\nThat took all the fun out of rage and revenge\n\n\n\nDon't be so quick to judge, reign havok from above\n\nI think I've had enough, time to raise the dead\n\nIt's all subliminal, supernatural\n\nI might be mental but I've still got my cred\n\n\n\nSo welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?\n\nWhere rabbits have teeth and the wolves carry knives\n\nYou enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised\n\nWelcome to the darkside\n\n\n\nSpare me your sorrow, there's no tomorrow\n\nThat's an empty promise at best\n\nI tried to play nice, you were baptized in ice\n\nSo don't tell me you're just depressed\n\n\n\nDon't be so quick to judge, reign havok from above\n\nI think I've had enough, time to raise the dead\n\nIt's all subliminal, supernatural\n\nI might be mental but I've still got my cred\n\n\n\nSo welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?\n\nWhere rabbits have teeth and the wolves carry knives\n\nYou enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised\n\nWelcome to the darkside\n\n\n\nYour equilibrium has been spun all around\n\nAnd everything you know turned upside down\n\nThe symptoms are contagious so please be advised\n\nSo welcome to the darkside\n\n\n\nDon't be so quick to judge, reign havok from above\n\nI think I've had enough, time to raise the dead\n\nIt's all subliminal, supernatural\n\nI might be mental but I've still got my cred\n\n\n\nSo welcome to the party, won't you please come inside?\n\nWhere rabbits have teeth and the wolves carry knives\n\nYou enter at your own risk, so don't be surprised\n\nWelcome to the darkside\n\n\n\nYour equilibrium has been spun all around\n\nAnd everything you know turned upside down\n\nThe symptoms are contagious so please be advised\n\nSo welcome to the darkside\n\n\n\n(Darkside, darkside) Welcome to the darkside\n\n(Darkside, darkside) Welcome to the darkside\n\n(Darkside, darkside) So welcome to the darkside\n\n(Darkside, darkside) So welcome to the darkside"
