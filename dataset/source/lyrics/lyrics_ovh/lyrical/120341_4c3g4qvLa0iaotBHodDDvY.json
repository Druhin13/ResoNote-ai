  "lyrics": "Nah' I don't usually smoke, but the night feel right\r\nAnd I don't usually drink, but the lights so bright\r\nBut I'm scared of too much, but that'll light this place\r\nShe said \"You can get it\", so you know the right price\r\nLotta' time babygirl, could be somebody you love\r\nThey're really tryna' move slow, she told me \"Nah', I don't rush\"\n\nI threw them dollar in the air, but I know I can't touch\n\nI let 'em know champagne, I'm ashamed of the the thing that we know is lust, but I need it by tonight\n\nBottles, it rainin' so slowly\n\nBut it doesn't matter, I'm in too deep, and I know\n\n\n\nI come this far, I can't fuckin' complain\n\nI get the seats with the desk on the plane\n\nParts of my past I'm not proud to admit\n\nSo I will confess, there no truth in the name\n\nNigga I'm King Kong to these Snow Whites\n\nThese eyes can adjust really good in the low lights\n\nI been around 'em my whole life\n\nThank Jesus, a nigga never turned to a low life\n\nStill fuckin' holy, drugs in the crown moldin'\n\nStill feelin' like I'm Pac when I'm rollin'\n\nMoney is the motive, gotta tell them what the mode is\n\nHopin' I can stay alive in the moment\n\nStill got my mind made up\n\nYou don't wanna see the fuck I'm made of\n\nBrought up in the Miami area\n\nThis is the beginnin', only lookin' at the beta\n\nNever settled down, nigga never go slow\n\nRide or die nigga, need my own GoPro\n\nGotta' feed the fam', this is all I know\n\nLove for my niggas, these are all my bros\n\nAll I fuckin' know is the risk\n\nAin't' talkin' money, then they ain't' don't exist\n\nMy intuition is follow the vision\n\nFirst you caught a wave, but then you went adrift\n\nCame from the dirt, but I'm oh so vain\n\nStarted from the block but I'm on Kobain\n\nI do not say this shit just for display\n\nI pray you don't give me reasons to pray\n\nAnd nobody better baby, I'm right up\n\nToo late now they can't save us\n\nAin't' never felt nothing liver\n\nJust the way that the dream made us\n\n\n\nBottles, it rainin' so slowly\n\nBut it doesn't matter, I'm in too deep, and I know"
