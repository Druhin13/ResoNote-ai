  "lyrics": "And I, I tend to be my own worst enemy\r\nAnd I, I linger on everything\r\nBut I find when I'm alone, it gets so hard to breathe\r\nAnd I, I, and I\r\nShouldn't apologize for just existing\n\nShouldn't apologize for just being me\n\nTrying to hide behind all my distractions\n\nOkay 'til the quiet comes\n\n\n\nWhen it all dies down, it gets so loud\n\nAll the voices in my head just try to fill me up with doubt\n\nI'm learning how to turn around\n\nAll the voices in my head\n\nI think I found my favorite sound\n\n\n\nI think I found my favorite sound\n\nOh, I think I found my favorite sound\n\n\n\nDo you take the time to recognize yourself?\n\nDo you spin like a carousel?\n\nI want you to know that it's okay to ask for help\n\nWe all need help, we all need help\n\n\n\nShouldn't apologize for just existing\n\nShouldn't apologize for just being me\n\nTrying to hide behind all my distractions\n\nOkay when the quiet comes\n\n\n\nWhen it all dies down, it gets so loud\n\nAll the voices in my head just try to fill me up with doubt\n\nI'm learning how to turn around\n\nAll the voices in my head\n\nI think I found my favorite sound\n\n\n\nI think I found my favorite sound\n\nOh, I think I found my favorite sound\n\nI think I found my favorite sound\n\nOh, I think I found my favorite sound\n\n\n\nEmbrace the silence\n\nTrying to find this feeling that I'm doing okay\n\nI'm my own project, a work in progress\n\nI know I'm better than okay"
