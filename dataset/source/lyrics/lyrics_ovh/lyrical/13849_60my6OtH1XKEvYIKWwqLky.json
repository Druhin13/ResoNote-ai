  "lyrics": "I had a vision\r\nI tried to warn them, but they didn't listen\r\nSo now they view from the sidelines, watchin' it all come together\r\nIt's time for the intervention, it's time for a new religion\r\nI met the stars but I feel the same, come off the plane and it feel different\r\nTo come home and feel distant, I'm trapped in my head but swear\n\nI'm still in it and I'ma stay here, so get used to me\n\nAin't the same person that I used to be but still humanly\n\nWe breathe the same air, lookin' at the game like a daycare\n\nThe team too strong, they like, \"Towk, you ain't playin' fair\"\n\nWatch me just manifest, Frankenstein, make it come to life\n\nFloat to the skies like Pegasus, I might burn alive\n\nWon't regret my mistake, trust in the sciences\n\nGotta feel that heat just to know how hot that fire get\n\nAnd I'ma keep supplyin' it, because it's high in demand\n\nI got a hunger that could silence the lambs\n\nAnd if I fail, bet I try it again, they probably try and attack\n\nThey shoot shots bet I fire 'em back, like \"pop, pop, pop\"\n\nHit 'em like oh my god, pull yo' card, why you tryna act that hard?\n\nSo show some proof, want it, we can go there too\n\nThat's not the move, been holdin' back but now I'm 'bout to let it loose\n\nAnd if you want it, what you tryna do?\n\nAnd if you got it, then just show me some proof\n\nI just [?]\n\n[?] And really I'm 'bout to let it loose\n\nI'm 'bout to let it loose\n\nNow, I'm 'bout to let it loose\n\nReally, I'm 'bout to let it loo-"
