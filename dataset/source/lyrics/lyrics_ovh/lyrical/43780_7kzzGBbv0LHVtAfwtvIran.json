  "lyrics": "The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly\nThe trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly\nThen you and I came wandering by\nAnd lost in a sigh were we\nThe shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly\nI can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly\n\nYour arms opened wide and closed me inside\n\nYou took my lips, you took my love so tenderly"
