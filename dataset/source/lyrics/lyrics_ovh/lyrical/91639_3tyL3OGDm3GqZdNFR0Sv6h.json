I'ma snatch out of malice\n\nTalk cash, rubber band snaps as my ad-libs\n\nRich boo, I'ma hit him when I'm richer\n\nPopped up 'cause damn I really missed her\n\nI spoil though I'm disloyal\n\nOnly 'cause I feel so muthafuckin' royal\n\n\n\nWho better for you than your girl? Uh-huh\n\nWho better for the show, for the soul, nah\n\nWho better for you than your girl? Uh-huh\n\nUh-huh\n\n\n\nChampagne dreams and manmade bodies\n\nGaze so sweet, I'm starry-eyed regardless\n\nEyes on the prize and yes I, I love it\n\nDon't act so surprised, you know I can't trust it\n\nWithdraw from the basic you've been hearin' daily\n\nKnow you wanna sweet talk, nobody can make me\n\nNobody can make me, yeah\n\nYeah yeah, I think you need inspirin'\n\nAll these simple minded shorties are conspirin' against me\n\nAgainst me, yeah\n\nI'm in a weird mood, don't inquire 'bout what I do\n\nYou'll find out soon, sooner than you'd like to\n\nSooner than you'd like to\n\nI like out-doin' my own thoughts\n\nEscape my own box, twisting my own plot\n\nSomethin' fittin' 'bout the top spot, I need that\n\nWhen I get it then I'll stay there, believe that\n\nMaybe I got a little dangerous\n\n20 sum' chasin' somethin' they cannot grasp\n\nGivin' me advice, that's somethin' that I ain't ask for\n\n\n\nYou need a challenge, you need a Douns\n\nI'm lackin' balance, turn the game into my palace\n\nWhere the throne, ho? I'ma snatch out of malice\n\nTalk cash, rubber band snaps as my ad-libs\n\nRich boo, I'ma hit him when I'm richer\n\nPopped up 'cause damn I really missed her\n\nI spoil though I'm disloyal\n\nOnly 'cause I feel so mothafuckin' royal\n\n\n\nWho better for you than your girl? Uh-huh\n\nWho better for you than your girl? Uh-huh\n\nWho better for the show, for the soul nah\n\nWho better for the show, for the soul nah\n\nUh-huh"
