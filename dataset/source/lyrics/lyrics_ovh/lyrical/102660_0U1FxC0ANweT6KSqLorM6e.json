  "lyrics": "For God so loved the world, He gave His Son\r\nTo bear the weight of sin, He bled for us\r\nFrom Heaven's highest place, He took a fall\r\nAnd there was just one life, laid down for all\r\nDeath, where is your sting?\n\nGrave, where is your victory?\n\nHe's alive, He's alive\n\nHe is risen!\n\n\n\nBehold the vacant tomb that held our Lord\n\nThat grave became the stage for Heaven's glory\n\nAnd behold the Risen King in open skies\n\nHe is the Resurrection, He is the life\n\n\n\nDeath, where is your sting?\n\nGrave, where is your victory?\n\nHe's alive, He's alive\n\nHe is risen!\n\n\n\nNo weapon formed against us will prosper\n\nThe gates of hell won't stand\n\nYour Church will rise from glory to glory\n\nIn the name of Jesus\n\nNo weapon formed against us will prosper\n\nThe gates of hell won't stand\n\nAnd Your Church will rise from glory to glory\n\nIn the name of Jesus\n\n\n\nDeath, where is your sting?\n\nGrave, where is your victory?\n\nHe's alive, He's alive\n\nHe is risen!\n\nDeath, where is your sting?\n\nGrave, where is your victory?\n\nHe's alive, He's alive\n\nHe is risen!"
