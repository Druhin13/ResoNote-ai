  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Fall on me par R.E.M\r\n   \n\nThere's a problem, feathers iron\nBargain buildings, weights and pullies\nFeathers hit the ground before the weight can leave the air\nBuy the sky and sell the sky and tell the sky and tell the sky\n\nDon't fall on me (What is it up in the air for) (It's gonna fall)\nFall on me (If it's there for long) (It's gonna fall)\nFall on me (It's over it's over me) (It's gonna fall)\n\n\nThere's the progress we have found (when the rain)\nA way to talk around the problem (when the children reign)\nBuilding towered foresight (keep your conscience in the dark)\nisn't anything at all (melt the statues in the park)\nBuy the sky and sell the sky and bleed the sky and tell the sky\n\nDon't fall on me (What is it up in the air for) (It's gonna fall)\nFall on me (If it's there for long) (It's gonna fall)\nFall on me (It's over it's over me) (It's gonna fall)\nDon't fall on me\n\n\nWell I could keep it above\nBut then it wouldn't be sky anymore\nSo if I send it to you you've got to promise to keep it whole\n\nBuy the sky and sell the sky and lift your arms up to the sky\nAnd ask the sky and ask the sky\n\nDon't fall on me (What is it up in the air for) (It's gonna fall)\nFall on me (If it's there for long) (It's gonna fall)\nFall on me (It's over it's over me) (It's gonna fall)"
