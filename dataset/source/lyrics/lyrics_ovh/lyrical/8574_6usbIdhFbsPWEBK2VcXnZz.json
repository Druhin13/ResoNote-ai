  "lyrics": "Reading in the phone booth\r\nSucking on a ginger root\r\nI never got to talk to you\r\nWhy is this the image I come back to?\r\nPick my jewelry from the ash\r\nFind the box with the cold hard cash in it\n\nGive it to the next of kin\n\n\n\nI used to be too deep inside my head\n\nNow I'm too far out of my skin\n\nToo far out of my skin\n\nI am at peace with my death\n\nI can go back to bed\n\nI am at peace with my death\n\nI can go back to bed\n\n\n\nI make a desert of my mind\n\nUnfold myself so flat and wide\n\nHave nothing in mind in sight\n\nNo cover for my thoughts to hide\n\nNever entered my code\n\nBut I held your hand in the pocket of my coat\n\nI learned to be loving and then to be alone\n\nSatisfied body and a hungry soul\n\n\n\nI used to be too deep inside my head\n\nNow I'm too far out of my skin\n\nToo far out of my skin\n\nI am at peace with my death\n\nI can go back to bed\n\nI am at peace with my death\n\nI can go back to bed\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be that man on the train\n\nOn a grey commute, imagining fame\n\nSweet relief, I will never be complete\n\nI will never be complete\n\nI'll never know everything\n\nI will never be complete\n\nI will never be complete\n\nI will never be complete\n\nI'll never know everything\n\n\n\nI used to be too deep inside my head\n\nNow I'm too far out of my skin\n\nToo far out of my skin"
