  "lyrics": "Stuck on the dark side of the moon\r\nStuck on the dark side, dark side\r\nOur sadness was like the ships in the night, ships in the night\r\nBoth meet at the lighthouse\r\nThey were yearning for light, yearning for light\r\nFeel the ocean with tears only I came a ground\n\nAnd if I close my eyes now\n\nI can still hear the sound, still hear the sound\n\n\n\nThere's a message at the bottom of this bottle\n\nAnd it's calling out to me\n\nThere's a message at the bottom of this bottle\n\nSaying I can't set you free\n\n\n\nMy friend, I'll forever have you on repeat\n\nStuck on the dark side of the moon\n\nYour sadness I hear echoing in the ether\n\nYou were light in every room\n\nIf I close my eyes I can hear you\n\nLike you're sitting next to me (you're next to me)\n\nOh brother I hear you, I still hear you calling\n\nI have finally found some peace\n\n\n\nBrother I still hear you calling\n\nNever been so aware that I'm falling\n\nBrother I still hear you calling\n\nNever been so aware that I'm falling\n\nStuck here on for every morning\n\n\n\nThere's a message at the bottom of this bottle\n\nAnd it's calling out to me\n\nThere's a message at the bottom of this bottle\n\nSaying I can't set you free\n\nThere's a message at the bottom of this bottle\n\nStuck on the dark side of the moon\n\nThere's a message at the bottom of this bottle\n\nStuck on the dark side of the moon\n\n\n\nStuck on the dark side of the moon\n\nStuck on the dark side, dark side"
