  "lyrics": "Rolling seas, endless roads\r\nHeading into the sun\r\nBig skies, bigger dreams\r\nEnough for everyone\r\nI was brave, free of love\r\nI wanted to travel alone\n\nWe were born in the light\n\nI'm sorry I remembered it wrong\n\n\n\nI'm sorry that I broke you down\n\nI'm sorry that I thought it through\n\nI'm sorry that I looked and ran\n\nI couldn't keep up\n\nNot good enough\n\n\n\nYou were there when I needed you\n\nAnd without a word\n\nStood at my back when I wanted you\n\nTurned away when it hurt\n\nYou were there when I called for you\n\nAnd I walked away\n\nI've run so far but you're still on my mind\n\nYou're still on my mind\n\n\n\nThe sun began to burn too bright\n\nI saw myself in the light\n\nI opened the door and lost the dream\n\nAnd couldn't go back inside\n\nI took a road that led nowhere\n\nI didn't know that then\n\nBut I made my choice\n\nNow I've gone too far to come back here again\n\n\n\nI'm sorry that I let you down\n\nI'm sorry that I lost the way\n\nI'm sorry that I died and then came alive\n\nI couldn't keep up\n\n\n\nYou were there when I needed you\n\nAnd without a word\n\nStood at my back when I wanted you\n\nTurned away when it hurt\n\nYou were there when I called for you\n\nAnd I walked away\n\nI've run so far but you're still on my mind\n\nYou're still on my mind\n\n\n\nYou were there when I needed you\n\nAnd without a word\n\nStood at my back when I wanted you\n\nTurned away when it hurt\n\nYou were there when I called for you\n\nAnd I walked away\n\nI've run so far but you're still on my mind\n\nYou're still on my mind"
