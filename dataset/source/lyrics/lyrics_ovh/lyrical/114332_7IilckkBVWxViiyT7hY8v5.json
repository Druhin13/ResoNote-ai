  "lyrics": "I ain’t playing no games\r\n'Cause I’ve got nothing left to lose\r\nI'm so tired of circular motions\r\nThey leave me dizzy and confused\r\nMy heart, oh no, is not your revolving door\r\nI get stuck spinning and spinning and spinning\n\nOh, 'til I collapse on the floor\n\n\n\nBut every time that you touch me\n\nI forget what we’re fighting about\n\nOh, you come and you leave\n\nShame on me for believing every word out of your mouth\n\n\n\nTell me it’s over\n\nIf it’s really over\n\n‘Cause it don’t feel like it’s over whenever you’re closing the door, no\n\nSo tell me it's over\n\n\n\nDarling you\n\nOh, you taste so bittersweet\n\nCan’t get you off of my lips\n\nYou’re dangerous when you take me like a thief\n\n\n\nOh and I\n\nI should let this go\n\nI try and I try, I try\n\nBut why, why won't you leave me alone?\n\n\n\nTell me it’s over\n\nIf it’s really over\n\n‘Cause it don’t feel like it’s over whenever you’re closing the door, no\n\nSo tell me it's over\n\nIf it’s really over\n\n'Cause every time you come over it doesn't feel over no more\n\nSo tell me it's over\n\n\n\nI keep on leaving the light on\n\nHoping to find something else, oh\n\nI've played the fool for the last time\n\nI just can't do this myself\n\n\n\nTell me it’s over\n\nIf it’s really over\n\n‘Cause it don’t feel like it’s over whenever you’re closing the door, no\n\nTell me it's over\n\nIf it’s really over\n\n'Cause every time you come over it doesn't feel over no more\n\nSo tell me it's over"
