  "lyrics": "Take you down\r\nTake you slowly away\r\nClose your eyes\r\nLet me show you the way to my heart\r\nFeeling empty today\r\nMy heart is feeling empty today\n\n\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou're taking my breathe away\n\nYou're taking my breathe away\n\n\n\nYou're blacking out\n\nI see your silouette\n\nYou taste like lies, jealousy and regret\n\nAlways disguise how you hurt me within\n\nSomehow I like when you get under my skin\n\n\n\nLet me take you down\n\nTake you slowly away\n\nClose your eyes\n\nLet me show you the way to my heart\n\nFeeling empty today\n\nMy heart is feeling empty today\n\n\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou're taking my breathe away\n\nYou're taking my breathe away\n\n\n\nI'm not perfect\n\nI'm still searching\n\nSomewhere in between clubs and churches\n\nSomewhere in between parades and hearses\n\nSo while I have you here in person\n\n\n\nLet me take you down\n\nTake you slowly away\n\nClose your eyes\n\nLet me show you the way to my heart\n\nFeeling empty today\n\nMy heart is feeling empty today\n\n\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou take my, you're taking my breathe away\n\nYou're taking my breathe away\n\nYou're taking my breathe away"
