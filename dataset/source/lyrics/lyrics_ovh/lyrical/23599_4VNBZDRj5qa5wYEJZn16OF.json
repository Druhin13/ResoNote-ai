  "lyrics": "Little tramp comin' up the strip with a hundred dollar smile\r\nSparks flyin' off her fingertips, drive the young cop wild\r\nSome nights are wound so tight like a storm about to break\r\nBetter stand in your doorway when everything starts to shake\r\nYou get restless like a cat waking up at midnight,\n\nHungry, never quite satisfied\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nThis is our world and these are our times\n\nThis is our world and these are our times\n\n\n\nLittle brother like a street god with a drop dead attitude\n\nSay he's looking like a shadow now, runnin' low on green and food\n\nSome lives are wound up tight like a wave about to crash\n\nHard times seem to multiply while the joy runs out so fast\n\n\n\nYou get restless like a kid crawling out of a bad dream\n\nHungry, never quite satisfied\n\n\n\nchorus repeats 2x\n\n\n\n(Solo)\n\n\n\nMake way for the son of a rebel wired to a bottle of flame\n\nHe's got two black eyes and a purple heart and a bone hangin' on a chain\n\nThese times are like dynamite, a head-on with history\n\nSome fool's bound to burn it all down, don't care about you and me\n\n\n\nHe'll get desperate like a child in the eye of a nightmare\n\nHungry, never quite satisfied\n\n\n\nchorus repeats 2x..."
