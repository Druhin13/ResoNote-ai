  "lyrics": "Yeah I picked it all up and I moved to the city\r\nIt's never dark and it doesn't feel right\r\nThe bar's are always full and the people are so pretty\r\nHollow little vessels that survive on the lights\r\nVaguely-rolling hills and a sleepy little sunrise\n\nI even slept a little bit last night\n\nSome populated people, they are waiting for salvation\n\nI've never been there but I heard that it's nice\n\n\n\nAnd we go like death can't touch us tonight\n\nCome back barely alive\n\nNow we're right back where we started off\n\nAw hell, you got me wonderin' why\n\n\n\nI been movin' on just to keep the fire burning\n\nMy voice is gone but the band wants to play\n\nPeople go to work and the wheel, it keeps on turning\n\nA little quiet at the end of the day\n\n\n\nHere we go, like the doomed little creatures we are\n\nKeep our palms to the sky\n\nNow we're right back where we started off\n\nAw hell, you got me wonderin' why\n\n\n\nI think about the water that brought me out of hiding\n\nI walk around a little drunk in the rain\n\nLaughin' like a devil in a dim little hallway\n\nI could the minutes 'til I see you again\n\n\n\nHere we go to a dark and comforting place\n\nSit and listen to the pines\n\nAnd now we're right back where we started off\n\nAw hell, you got me wonderin' why\n\nWe're right back where we started off\n\nAw hell, you got me wonderin' why"
