  "lyrics": "A young man came to a house of prayer\r\nThey did not ask what brought him there\r\nHe was not friend, he was not kin\r\nBut they opened the door and let him in\r\nAnd for an hour the stranger stayed\n\nHe sat with them and seemed to pray\n\nBut then the young man drew a gun\n\nAnd killed nine people, old and young\n\n\n\nIn Charleston in the month of June\n\nThe mourners gathered in a room\n\nThe President came to speak some words\n\nAnd the cameras rolled and the nation heard\n\n\n\nBut no words could say what must be said\n\nFor all the living and the dead\n\nSo on that day and in that place\n\nThe President sang Amazing Grace\n\nThe President sang Amazing Grace\n\n\n\nWe argued where to place the blame\n\nOn one man's hate or our nation's shame\n\nSome sickness of the mind or soul\n\nAnd how the wounds might be made whole\n\n\n\nBut no words could say what must be said\n\nFor all the living and the dead\n\nSo on that day and in that place\n\nThe President sang Amazing Grace\n\nMy President sang Amazing Grace"
