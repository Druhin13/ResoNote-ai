  "lyrics": "I won't pretend\r\nThat we can control the night\r\nOr what kind of road we're on\r\nOr where we will see the light\r\nBut right now I'm talking to ya\r\nI'm looking into your eyes\n\nRight now I'm trying to show ya\n\nThat we're gonna be alright\n\n\n\nOh I don't know\n\nWhat's around the bend\n\nOh all I know\n\nIs that my love\n\nIt knows no end\n\n\n\nAll these pieces they fall in line\n\nBecause I'm forever on your side\n\nTake my hand when you can't see the light\n\n'Cause I'm forever on your side\n\nI will carry you every time\n\nBecause I'm forever on your side\n\nOh I'm forever on your side\n\n\n\nThey'll beat you up\n\nBut don't let 'em keep you down\n\nYou're always tough enough\n\nAnd I'll always be around\n\n\n\nOh I can't promise that a day will never come\n\nWhere the ground beneath us falls out and you got nowhere to run\n\nOh but you won't be alone when the water starts to rise up\n\nNo you won't be alone my darling when the rains come"
