  "lyrics": "Haven't we come this long, long way\r\nFrom the center of the earth?\r\nDid we not greet every single day\r\nWith a scream since the night of our birth?\r\nOnly in our dreams do we dare to hope and wait\n\nAnd we drink from Lethe's well.\n\nWe listen to our sighs as they slowly fade,\n\nLike the chimes of a mourning bell.\n\n\n\nLives and ships have been shattered\n\nBy the iron claws of the sea.\n\nDid they ever really matter?\n\nIs there no one that hears me?\n\n\n\nThe fog is much too dense\n\nAnd I can't find\n\nAnyone.\n\nWe grope about as we dance\n\nBut remain blind.\n\nWhere have we gone?\n\nWhere have we gone?\n\n\n\nOur memories are fading with the endless years\n\nAnd what used to be true beyond doubt:\n\nThat someone could exist in the outer spheres.\n\nThe world rests under a shroud.\n\n\n\nWith no substance interfering\n\nThere are no echoes left at all,\n\nAnd the sounds keep disappearing.\n\nNo one ever heeds the call.\n\n\n\nThe fog is much too dense\n\nAnd I can't find\n\nAnyone.\n\nWe grope about as we dance\n\nBut remain blind.\n\nWhere have we gone?\n\n\n\nWe've been drifting in the dark, uttering noises,\n\nKnowing that our strength will wane.\n\nWill an echo ever come from the voices\n\nOr must we wait for them in vain?\n\n\n\nThe fog is much too dense\n\nAnd I can't find\n\nAnyone.\n\nWe grope about as we dance\n\nBut remain blind.\n\nWhere have we gone?\n\nThe fog is much too dense\n\nAnd I can't find\n\nAnyone.\n\nWe grope about as we dance\n\nBut remain blind.\n\nWhere have we gone?\n\nWhere have we gone?"
