  "lyrics": "I wasn't thinking straight\r\nI was too busy trying to turn something into nothing\r\nMy heads up in outer space\r\nAt least I don't have to hear about all of this tomorrow now\r\nI'm doing fine\n\nI've done my time\n\nThere's no turning back\n\n\n\nForgive and forget, I'm not there yet\n\nIt's hard to do when you're sober\n\nRehearse my lines to cut all my ties\n\nIt's hard to say that it's over\n\n\n\nNext time you come around\n\nBring a glass and a bottle maybe we get to the bottom of this\n\nOr check the lost and found\n\nTo see if anyone picked up the rest of our relationship\n\n\n\nI want to forget or get over\n\nIt's hard to do"
