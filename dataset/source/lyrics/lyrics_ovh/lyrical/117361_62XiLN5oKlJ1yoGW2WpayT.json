  "lyrics": "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\r\nEverywhere you go\r\nTake a look at the five and ten\r\nIt's glistening once again\r\nWith candy canes and silver lanes aglow\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nToys in every store\n\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\n\nOn your own front door\n\n\n\nA pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots\n\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben\n\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk\n\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen\n\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nEverywhere you go;\n\nThere's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well\n\nIt's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nSoon the bells will start\n\nAnd the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\n\nRight within your heart\n\n\n\nA pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots\n\nIs the wish of Barney and Ben\n\nDolls that will talk and will go for a walk\n\nIs the hope of Janice and Jen\n\nAnd Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\n\nToys in every store\n\nBut the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be\n\nOn your own front door\n\n\n\nIt's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;\n\nSoon the bells will start\n\nAnd the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing\n\nRight within your heart\n\n\n\nOh, yeah"
