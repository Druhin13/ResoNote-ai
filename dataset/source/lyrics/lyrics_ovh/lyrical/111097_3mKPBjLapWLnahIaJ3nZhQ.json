  "lyrics": "I was stronger that night\r\nI wanted to go alone\r\nThe rain was coming down\r\nAnd nobody could leave, we stayed around\r\nI said things I knew you'd like\r\nAlaska and the bears\n\nYou knew you couldn't fight\n\nSwimming underneath the Northern Lights\n\n\n\nYou didn't know it\n\nBut I had you in the palm of my hand\n\nPalm of my hand\n\n\n\nI confess I needed you there\n\nI've gone through every memory we shared tonight\n\nAnd I don't have the guts to carry on without you\n\nWhen the storm breaks through I'll be standing there\n\nWaiting for you\n\nWaiting for you\n\nWaiting for you\n\n\n\nI can dream away your life\n\nHitch hike to the Southern tip of Africa\n\nAnd put up all the fences that you like\n\nBut I can't sing you to sleep there\n\nYou're on your own there\n\nYou're on your own\n\n\n\nI didn't know it\n\nI thought I had you in the palm of my hand\n\nPalm of my hand\n\n\n\nI confess I needed you there\n\nI've gone through every memory we shared tonight\n\nAnd I don't have the guts to carry on without you\n\nWhen the storm breaks through I'll be standing there\n\nWaiting for you\n\n\n\nTake me down love me in the avenue\n\nIt'll never be what you want it to\n\nWas it like this with her?\n\nIs it everything you dreamed of?\n\n\n\nI, I, I thought I had you in the palm of my hand\n\nPalm of my hand\n\n\n\nI confess I needed you there\n\nI've gone through every memory we shared tonight\n\nAnd I don't have the guts to carry on without you\n\nWhen the storm breaks through I'll be standing there\n\nWaiting for you\n\nWaiting for you\n\nWaiting for you\n\n\n\nAre you ready, tell me when you want to go\n\nAre you ready, tell me when you want to go"
