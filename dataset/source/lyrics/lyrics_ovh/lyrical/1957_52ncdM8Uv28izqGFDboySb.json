  "lyrics": "The night club was burning\r\nFrom the torch singer's song\r\nAnd the sweat was floodin' her eyes\r\nThe catwalk squeaked\r\n'Neath the bartender's feet\r\nAnd the smoke was too heavy to rise\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nShe sang of the love that I left her\n\nAnd of the woman that she'll never be\n\nMade me feel like the buck and a quarter\n\nThat I paid 'em to listen and see\n\nI paid 'em to listen and see\n\n\n\nI was born down in Kansas\n\n'Neath the October sky\n\nWork the day shift from seven to three\n\nAnd the only relief that I receive\n\nIs nearer my God to Thee\n\n\n\nShe constantly throws me off timing\n\nLeaves me standing both naked and bare\n\nMakes me feel like the Sunday funnies\n\nAfter everything's gone off the air\n\nEverything's gone off the air\n\n\n\nI picked through the ashes\n\nOf the torch singer's song\n\nAnd I ordered my money a round\n\nFor whiskey and pain\n\nBoth taste the same\n\nDuring the time they go down\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)"
