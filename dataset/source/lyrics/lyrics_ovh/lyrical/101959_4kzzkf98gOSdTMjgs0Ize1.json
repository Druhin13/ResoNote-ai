  "lyrics": "Frosty the snowman, frosty the snowman\r\nFrosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul\r\nWith a corncob pipe and a button nose \nAnd two eyes made out of coal \nFrosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say\n\nHe was made of snow but the children know\n\nHow he came to life one day \n\n\n\nThere must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found \n\nFor when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around \n\n\n\nFrosty the snowman was alive as he could be\n\nAnd the children say he could laugh and play\n\nJust the same as you and me \n\n\n\nThumpetty thump thump, thumpety thump thump\n\nLook at Frosty go \n\nThumpetty thump thump, thumpety thump thump\n\nOver the hills of snow \n\n\n\nFrosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day\n\nSo he said, \"Let's run and we'll have some fun \n\nNow before I melt away\" \n\nDown to the village with a broomstick in his hand\n\nRunning here and there all around the square \n\nSaying, \"Catch me if you can\"\n\n\n\nFrosty the snowman, frosty the snowman\n\n\n\nHe led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop \n\nAnd he only paused a moment when he heard him holler \"Stop!\" \n\n\n\nFrosty the snow man had to hurry on his way\n\nBut he waved goodbye saying, \"Don't you cry, I'll be back again some day\" \n\n\n\nFrosty the snowman, frosty the snowman\n\nFrosty the snowman, frosty the snowman"
