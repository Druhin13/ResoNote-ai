  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Archipelago par Andrew Bird\r\nWhat if one day we just refused to play\nWith no one to hate, they'd be out of a job\nYou’ve gone off script, you just can't walk away\nLeave us naked, fleeced and racked with sobs\n\nWhoa\nWe're locked in a death grip and it’s taking its toll\nWhen our enemies are what make us whole\nListen to me\nNo more excuses, no more apathy\nThis ain't no archipelago, no remote atoll\n\nAll my enemies, they just fall in love with me\nKeeping us distracted while the till gets robbed\n\nAll our cries were cried\nNow there are no sides\nTry selling that one to an angry mob\n\nWhoa\nJ. Edgar Hoover wore a white mink stole\nHis enemies are what made him whole\nOh, what made him whole\n(His enemies are what made him whole)\nWhoa\nA three-headed monster swallows Tokyo\nHer enemies are what make her whole\n(Her enemies are what make her whole)\nWhoa\n(Our enemies are what make us whole)\nWe're locked in a death grip and it's taking its toll\nWhen our enemies are what make us whole\n\n(Our enemies are what make us whole)\nWhoa\n(Our enemies are what make us whole)\nNo more excuses, no more apathy\nThis ain't no archipelago, no remote atoll\n(Our enemies are what make us whole)\n(Our enemies are what make us whole)"
