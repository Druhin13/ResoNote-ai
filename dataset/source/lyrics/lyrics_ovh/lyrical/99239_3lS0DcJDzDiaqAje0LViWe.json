  "lyrics": "Just look at this mess I’ve made in the thick of it\r\nI like it like this but I’d never tell you that\r\n‘Cause I lie like the colors of the rainbow\r\nJust look at these grown ass men at my beck and call\r\nWherever we go, God helps those who help themselves\n\n\n\nAs I lie like the colors of the rainbow\n\nAs I cheat like the daisies in the field\n\nAnd they inhale it like the oxygen I could borrow\n\nIf I cared how not to steal\n\n\n\nDon’t let him get to you\n\nDon’t let him put you off your game\n\nWith his hey batter batter swing\n\n\n\nHe wants you to blow a fuse\n\nAt the sight of the mess he thinks he made\n\nWith his hey batter batter swing\n\nBut good eye:\n\n\n\nThis mess wasn’t made alone\n\nOur sandlot antagonist-cum-king\n\nBuilds throne after gilded throne\n\nOn the rock of our disbelief in the thick of it\n\n\n\nAs he lies like the colors of the rainbow\n\nAs he cheats like the daisies in the field\n\nAnd we inhale it like the oxygen he could borrow\n\nIf he cared how not to steal"
