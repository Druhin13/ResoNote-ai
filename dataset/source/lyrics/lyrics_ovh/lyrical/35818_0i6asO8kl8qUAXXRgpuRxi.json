(?) (?)\nBack to back make a double\nDon't get in trouble I know some shooters\n(?) (?) (?)\nSo you better suit up\nWanna milli like Wayne verse\nI'm tryna be too up\n\nBest believe that I break\nCause karma might come back and shoot us\n\nI done been through some things\nKarma said pay up\nIf you owe me money\nThen you better pay us\nFor the boys get to dump it\nIma mark where you lay up\nLord forgive me foreal foreal\nCause karma gone pay us\n\nI done been through some things\nKarma said pay up\nIf you owe me money\nThen you better pay us\nFor the boys get to dump it\nIma mark where you lay up\n\nLord forgive me foreal foreal\nCause karma gone pay us\n\nI done been through some things\nKarma said pay up\nIf you owe me money\nThen you better pay us\nFor the boys get to dump it\nIma mark where you lay up\nLord forgive me foreal foreal\nCause karma gone pay us"
