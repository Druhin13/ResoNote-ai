Got so aggressive\n\nI know we meant all good intentions\n\nSo pull me closer\n\nWhy don't you pull me close?\n\nWhy don't you come on over?\n\nI can't just let you go\n\n\n\nOh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?\n\nI'm losing my mind just a little\n\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle?\n\nIn the middle\n\n\n\nLooking at you, I can't lie\n\nJust pouring out admission\n\nRegardless of my objection, oh, oh\n\nAnd it's not about my pride\n\nI need you on my skin\n\nJust come over, pull me in, just\n\n\n\nOh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?\n\nI'm losing my mind just a little\n\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle?\n\nIn the middle, no no\n\nBaby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?\n\nOh yeah, I'm losing my mind just a little\n\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle?\n\nOh, in the middle\n\nBaby-y-y, why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?\n\nI'm losing my mind just a little\n\nSo why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?\n\nIn the middle, middle"
