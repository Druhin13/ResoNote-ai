  "lyrics": "Yes, Willow weep for me\rWillow weep for me\rBend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea\rListen to my plea\rListen willow and weep for me\rYes, Gone my lovers dream\rLovely summer dream\rGone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream\rSad as I can be\rHear me willow and weep for me\rOh, Whisper to the wind and say that love's a sin\rLeave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan\rMurmur to the night to hide her starry light\rSo none will find me sighing, crying all alone\rOh, willow weep tree\rWeeping sympathy\rBend your branches down along the ground and cover me\rWhen the shadows fall, bend over willow and weep for me\rWhisper to the wind and say that love is sin\rLeave my heart a-breaking, and making a moan\rMurmur to the night to hide her starry light\rSo none will find me sighing and crying all alone\rYes, willow weep tree\rWeeping sympathy\rBend your branches down along the ground and cover me\rWhen the shadows fall, bend over willow and weep for me\rYes"
