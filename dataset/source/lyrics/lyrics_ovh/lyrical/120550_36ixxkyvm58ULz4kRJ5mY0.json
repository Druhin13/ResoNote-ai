Show you where my safe is?\n\nI swear you all I ever wanted but don't play, bitch\n\nMy heart been broke too many times, all that fake shit, yeah\n\nI got trust issues, fucked up by them other bitches\n\nYeah, I'm fuckin' with you, but I ain't a sucker nigga\n\nI ain't fussin' with you, nothin' like them other niggas\n\nI wanna believe you when you say you love a nigga\n\n\n\nWhen I say I love you, tell me, do you believe me?\n\nDo you want me for my money or do you need me?\n\nIf I gave you my all, would you take it and leave me?\n\nI ain't askin' you for no reason\n\nYou say you ride or die, and I wanna believe you\n\nBut if I get caught up, would you be there when I need you?\n\nJust you and I for life, I won't leave you\n\nI ain't doin' this for no reason\n\n\n\n(Come here)\n\nGot a lot on my mind, baby, can you help me out? (Need some advice)\n\nNiggas just lurkin' on my cash, niggas tryna get some clout (What I'm 'posed to do?)\n\nI know you not here for the fame, and shit, I can vent to you (I can open up)\n\nI don't wanna let my guard down (Why?), but baby, I'm into you (I am)\n\nEverybody ain't made for this\n\nRemember I'm the only one gettin' paid for this (Paid for this)\n\nYou say you ride or die (I hear you talkin')\n\nWell we gon' see (Well we gon' see)\n\nIf you watch me slump a nigga, would you keep it G? (Close your mouth, don't say shit)\n\nTake a seat, let me introduce you to the real me (Bagg)\n\nIf you met me when I was plain, would you still feel me (Huh?)\n\nIf I lost all this shit today, would you stick it out?\n\nHold me down 'til we figure it out?\n\nAnswer this (I got some questions)\n\n\n\nWhen I say I love you, tell me, do you believe me?\n\nDo you want me for my money or do you need me?\n\nIf I gave you my all, would you take it and leave me?\n\nI ain't askin' you for no reason\n\nYou say you ride or die, and I wanna believe you\n\nBut if I get caught up, would you be there when I need you?\n\nJust you and I for life, I won't leave you\n\nI ain't doin' this for no reason\n\n\n\nI wanna believe you when you say you love me\n\nI wanna believe you when you say you love me"
