  "lyrics": "Woe sweet mama, lay me down in my grave\r\nLeave me baby, I’m too far gone to save\r\nThe snow is comin’, all the village folk know\r\nThis wicked shiver, chills me down to my soul\r\nOnly time will tell\r\nTake the ox to town and you can sell\n\nAnd leave me in my bed\n\nToday\n\n\n\nThe Yankee peddler bargains with you on his way\n\nWoe sweet mama’s gotten herself a new dray\n\nKeep the children snug as the wagon rolls on\n\nWhen the cold wind blows most of them will be gone\n\n\n\nOnly time can tell\n\nTake the ox to town and I’ll get well\n\nAnd leave me in my bed\n\nToday\n\n\n\nOnly time will tell\n\nYou take the ox to town and you can sell\n\nAnd leave me in my bed\n\nToday"
