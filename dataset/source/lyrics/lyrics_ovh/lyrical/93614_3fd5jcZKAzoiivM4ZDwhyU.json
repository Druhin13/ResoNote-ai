  "lyrics": "It's been a minute since I called you\r\nJust to hear the answerphone\r\nYeah, I know that you won't get this\r\nBut I'll leave a message so I'm not alone\r\nThis morning I woke up still dreaming\r\nWith memories playing through my head\n\nYou'll never know how much I miss you\n\nThe day that they took you, I wish it was me instead\n\n\n\nBut you once told me, \"Don't give up\n\nYou can do it day by day\"\n\nAnd diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away\n\n\n\nSo I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\nI will be the best of me, always keep you next to me\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\nEven when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone\n\nTattoo'd on my heart are the words of your favourite song\n\nI know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\n\n\nI could feel your blood run through me\n\nYou're written in my DNA\n\nLooking back in every mirror\n\nI know you'll be waiting, I'll see you again\n\n\n\nBut you once told me, \"Don't give up\n\nYou can do it day by day\"\n\nAnd diamonds, they don't turn to dust or fade away (Fade away)\n\n\n\nSo I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\nI will be the best of me, always keep you next to me\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\nEven when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone\n\nTattoo'd on my heart are the words of your favourite song\n\nI know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\n\n\nI promised you I'd do this\n\nSo all of this is all for you\n\nOh, I swear to God you're living\n\nThrough everything I'll ever do\n\n\n\nSo I will keep you, day and night, here until the day I die\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\nI will be the best of me, always keep you next to me\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\nEven when I'm on my own, I know I won't be alone\n\nTattoo'd on my heart are the words of your favourite song\n\nI know you'll be looking down, swear I'm gonna make you proud\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\n\n\nOne life for the two of us\n\nI'll be living one life for the two of us\n\n\n\nWe'll end just like we started\n\nJust you and me and no one else\n\nI will hold you where my heart is\n\nOne life for the two of us"
