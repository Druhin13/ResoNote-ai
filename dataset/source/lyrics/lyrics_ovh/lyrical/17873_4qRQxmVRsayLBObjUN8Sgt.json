  "lyrics": "Well the eagle's been flying slow and the flag's been flying low\r\nAnd a lot of people are saying that America's fixing to fall\r\nBut speaking just for me and some people from Tennessee\r\nWe got a thing or two to tell you all\r\nThis lady may have stumbled but she ain't never fell\r\nAnd if the Russians don't believe that they can all go straight to hell\n\nWe're gonna put her feet back on the path of righteousness\n\nAnd then God bless America again\n\n\n\nAnd you never did think that it ever would happen again\n\nIn America, did you?\n\nYou never did think that we'd ever get together again\n\nWell we damn sure fooled you\n\nWe're walking real proud and we're talking real loud again in America\n\nYou never did think that it ever would happen again\n\n\n\nFrom the sound up in Long Island out to San Francisco Bay\n\nAnd ev'ry thing that's in between them is our home\n\nAnd we may have done a little bit of fighting amongst ourselves\n\nBut you outside people best leave us alone\n\nCause we'll all stick together and you can take that to the bank\n\nThat's the cowboys and the hippies and the rebels and the yanks\n\nYou just go and lay your head on a Pittsburgh Steeler fan\n\nAnd I think you're gonna finally understand\n\n\n\nAnd you never did think that it ever would happen again\n\nIn America, did you?\n\nYou never did think that we'd ever get together again\n\nWell we damn sure fooled you\n\nWe're walking real proud and we're talking real loud again in America\n\nYou never did think that it ever would happen again"
