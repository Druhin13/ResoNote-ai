  "lyrics": "Every night, I live and die\r\nFeel the party to my bones\r\nWatch the wasters blow the speakers\r\nSpill my guts beneath the outdoor light\r\nIt's just another graceless night\r\nI hate the headlines and the weather\n\nI'm 19 and I'm on fire\n\nBut when we're dancing I'm alright\n\nIt's just another graceless night\n\n\n\nAre you lost enough?\n\nHave another drink, get lost in us\n\nThis is how we get notorious, oh\n\n'Cause I don't know\n\nIf they keep tellin' me where to go\n\nI'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh\n\n\n\nAll of the things we're taking\n\n'Cause we are young and we're ashamed\n\nSend us to perfect places\n\nAll of our heroes fading\n\nNow I can't stand to be alone\n\nLet's go to perfect places\n\n\n\nEvery night, I live and die\n\nMeet somebody, take 'em home\n\nLet's kiss and then take off our clothes\n\nIt's just another graceless night\n\n\n\nAll of the things we're taking\n\n'Cause we are young and we're ashamed\n\nSend us to perfect places\n\nAll of our heroes fading\n\nNow I can't stand to be alone\n\nLet's go to perfect places\n\n\n\nAll the nights spent off our faces\n\nTrying to find these perfect places\n\nWhat the fuck are perfect places anyway?\n\nAll the nights spent off our faces\n\nTrying to find these perfect places\n\nWhat the fuck are perfect places anyway?\n\nAll the nights spent off our faces\n\nTrying to find these perfect places\n\nWhat the fuck are perfect places anyway?"
