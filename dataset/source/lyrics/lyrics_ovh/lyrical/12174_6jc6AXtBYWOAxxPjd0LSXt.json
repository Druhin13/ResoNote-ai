  "lyrics": "I met a man without a dollar to his name\r\nWho had no traits of any value but his smile\r\nI met a man who had no yearn or claim to fame\r\nWho was content to let life pass him for a while\r\nAnd I was sure that all I ever wanted\r\nWas a life like the movie stars led\n\nAnd he kissed me right here, and he said\n\n\n\n\"I'll give you stars and the moon and a soul to guide you\n\nAnd a promise I'll never go\n\nI'll give you hope to bring out all the life inside you\n\nAnd the strength that will help you grow\n\nI'll give you truth and a future that's twenty times better\n\nThan any Hollywood plot\"\n\nAnd I thought, \"You know, I'd rather have a yacht\"\n\n\n\nI met a man who lived his life out on the road\n\nWho left a wife and kids in Portland on a whim\n\nI met a man whose fire and passion always showed\n\nWho asked if I could spare a week to ride with him\n\nBut I was sure that all I ever wanted\n\nWas a life that was scripted and planned\n\nAnd he said, \"But you don't understand\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll give you stars and the moon and the open highway\n\nAnd a river beneath your feet\n\nI'll give you days full of dreams if you travel my way\n\nAnd a summer you can't repeat\n\nI'll give you nights full of passion and days of adventure\n\nNo strings, just warm summer rain\"\n\nAnd I thought, \"You know, I'd rather have champagne\"\n\n\n\nI met a man who had a fortune in the bank\n\nWho had retired at age thirty, set for life\n\nI met a man and didn't know which stars to thank\n\nAnd then he asked one day if I would be his wife\n\nAnd I looked up, and all that I could think of\n\nWas the life I had dreamt I would live\n\nAnd I said to him, \"What will you give?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'll give you cars and a townhouse in Turtle Bay\n\nAnd a fur and a diamond ring\n\nAnd we'll get married in Spain on my yacht today\n\nAnd we'll honeymoon in Beijing\n\nAnd you'll meet stars at the parties I throw in my villas\n\nIn Nice and Paris in June\"\n\n\n\nAnd I thought, \"Okay\"\n\nAnd I took a breath\n\nAnd I got my yacht\n\nAnd the years went by\n\nAnd it never changed\n\nAnd it never grew\n\nAnd I never dreamed\n\nAnd I woke one day\n\nAnd I looked around\n\nAnd I thought, \"My God...\n\nI'll never have the moon\""
