  "lyrics": "I take a breath\r\nI close my eyes\r\nI'm in another space and time\r\nA hidden layer\r\nAnother crime of reality\r\nParallel lines\n\n\n\nSomewhere we are together\n\nSomewhere in the stars\n\nImagine we are together in a world that isn't ours\n\nAnd you're holding me so tightly\n\nAnd this time you don't leave\n\nSomewhere we are together\n\nSomewhere in the stars\n\n\n\nI take a step beyond this place\n\nAnd I am floating in outer space\n\nThose people there, they look like we do\n\nBut all their dreaming is coming true\n\n\n\nSomewhere we are together\n\nSomewhere in the stars\n\nImagine we are together in a world that isn't ours\n\nAnd you're holding me so tightly\n\nAnd this time you don't leave\n\nSomewhere we are together\n\nSomewhere in the stars\n\n\n\nWhy can't this life be the one?\n\nWhen you and I met and we stayed in love\n\nWhy can't this life go the way I hoped and I planned and I prayed?\n\n\n\nSomewhere we are together\n\nSomewhere in the stars\n\nImagine we are together in a world that isn't ours\n\nAnd you're holding me so tightly\n\nAnd this time you don't leave\n\nSomewhere we are together\n\nSomewhere in the stars\n\n\n\nSomewhere\n\nI know I hold you somewhere"
