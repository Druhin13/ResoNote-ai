  "lyrics": "Doctor, I haven’t slept for days\r\nThe medication did not work\r\nBecause pills can’t cure a numbing pain\r\nDoctor, to hell with your cliches\r\nThe voices tell me you’re to blame\r\nStop telling me I’ll be okay\n\n\n\nIf you say that I am crazy I will say that you’re to blame\n\nYou got me hooked on beginners luck (a demon I can’t tame)\n\nIf you say that I am crazy I will say that you’re to blame\n\nNow I’m stuck in this fucking rut\n\nWith secrets I will take to my grave\n\n\n\nMy tongue is turning as you’re painting all the walls\n\nGod’s abandoned every call\n\nA natural disaster, he says that I’m worse than them all\n\nTime is ticking in my head, I could of been the best they said\n\nBut I never wanted less\n\nSo call me disaster and stop me from taking it all\n\n\n\nIf you say that I am crazy I will say that you’re to blame\n\nYou got me hooked on beginners luck\n\nA demon I can’t tame\n\nIf you say that I am crazy I will say that you’re to blame\n\nNow I’m stuck in this fucking rut\n\nWith secrets I will take to my grave\n\n\n\nThe story goes that the devil sold my soul\n\nHe said straight to hell we wish you so well (you’re on your own)\n\nWell now I know that it’s dangerous to hope\n\nBecause all you believe in is having doubts\n\n\n\nIf you say that I am crazy I will say that you’re to blame\n\nYou got me hooked on beginners luck (a demon I can’t tame)\n\nIf you say that I am crazy I will say that you’re to blame\n\nNow I’m stuck in this fucking rut\n\nWith secrets I will take to my grave"
