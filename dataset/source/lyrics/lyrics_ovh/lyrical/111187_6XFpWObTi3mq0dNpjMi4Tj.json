  "lyrics": "Love, down by the river\r\nUnder crystal clear skies\r\nI asked you for forgiveness\r\nOh, but I didn't know why\r\nHolding hands with the devil\r\nWalking down an empty road\n\nHolding hands with the savior\n\nWalking home all alone\n\nI thought I saw you in the mirror\n\nI heard your voice as the wind blew by\n\n\n\nIt told me there ain't nothing left\n\nNothing left for you\n\nNothing left for me\n\nIt told me there ain't nothing left\n\nNothing left to do\n\nNothing left for free\n\n\n\nTears drip, bones rattle\n\nBold horizon glides by\n\nI'm gearing up for battle\n\nThe battle of my mind\n\nSeen it all but the answer\n\nOh, still searching for a sign\n\nSeen it all but disaster,\n\nOh but then disaster comes to find\n\n\n\nIt told me there ain't nothing left\n\nNothing left for you\n\nNothing left for me\n\nIt told me there ain't nothing left\n\nNothing left to do\n\nNothing left for free\n\n\n\nIt told me there ain't nothing left\n\nNothing left for you\n\nNothing left for me\n\nIt told me there ain't nothing left\n\nNothing left to do\n\nNothing left for free"
