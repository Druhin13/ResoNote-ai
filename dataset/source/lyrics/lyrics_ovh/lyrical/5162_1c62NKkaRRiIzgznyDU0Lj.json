  "lyrics": "In Christ alone my hope is found\r\nHe is my light, my strength, my song\r\nThis Cornerstone, this solid ground\r\nFirm through the fiercest drought and storm\r\nWhat heights of love, what depths of peace\n\nWhen fears are stilled, when strivings cease\n\nMy Comforter, my All in All\n\nHere in the love of Christ I stand\n\n\n\nChrist alone; Cornerstone\n\nWeak made strong; in the Saviour's love\n\nThrough the storm, He is Lord\n\nLord of all\n\n\n\nWhen darkness seems to hide His face\n\nI rest on His unchanging grace\n\nIn every high and stormy gale\n\nMy anchor holds within the veil\n\nMy anchor holds within the veil\n\n\n\nChrist alone; Cornerstone\n\nWeak made strong; in the Saviour's love\n\nThrough the storm, He is Lord\n\nLord of all\n\n\n\nOn Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand;\n\nAll other ground is sinking sand\n\nAll other ground is sinking sand\n\n\n\nNo guilt in life, no fear in death\n\nThis is the power of Christ in me\n\nFrom life's first cry to final breath\n\nJesus commands my destiny\n\n\n\nNo power of hell, no scheme of man\n\nCan ever pluck me from His hand\n\n'Til He returns or calls me home\n\nChrist alone; Cornerstone\n\nHere in the power of Christ I'll stand"
