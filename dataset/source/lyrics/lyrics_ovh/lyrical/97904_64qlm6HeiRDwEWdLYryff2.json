  "lyrics": "Eight hour shift at the restaurant\r\nForty-seven things to be questioned on\r\nCollect my check then, yuh, I’m gone\r\nOn my way to the upper echelon\r\nCool so I’m tryna get my session on\r\nGod damn, I gotta get dome rest for once\n\nBut ain’t nobody else gonna get me some\n\nSo I dip my head and then I shoulder on\n\n\n\nI thought things would happen quicker\n\nCouldn’t see the bigger picture\n\nI guess I’ll just have to figure this out on my own\n\nMy friends still wouldn’t believe me\n\nIf they saw me on the TV\n\nNothing’s ever coming easy, this I know\n\n\n\nI got a ways to go before I get there\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nI feel my patience low while I sit here\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nLately the days are slow and it ain’t fair\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nFeel like I’m moving, meanwhile I’m stuck here\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\n(But one day, I’mma get there\n\nBut one day, I’mma)\n\n\n\nHol’ up\n\nDo it for your mama, she’s the only one that showed up\n\nSo when you blow up\n\nShe can tell her friends that she helped your a*s grow up\n\nIn the mean time, sorry mom for all the drama\n\nBut I need time before I get to count the commas\n\nA lotta love and a little bit of patience\n\nI could make a billion in the basement\n\n\n\nI got a ways to go before I get there\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nI feel my patience low while I sit here\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nLately the days are slow and it ain’t fair\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nFeel like I’m moving, meanwhile I’m stuck here\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there\n\nFeel like I’m moving, meanwhile I’m stuck here\n\nBut one day, I’mma get there"
