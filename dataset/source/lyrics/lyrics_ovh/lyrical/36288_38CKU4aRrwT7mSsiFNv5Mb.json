I got a short list\n\nAll of my niggas, the famo, and the Porsche whip\n\nI found the meaning of life, took the righteous way\n\nIt's food for thought and it's soul, ain't out the microwave\n\n\n\nYeah, presidents make the world spin off the axis\n\nI put family over everything, some niggas backwards\n\nI stick to the code just like a cactus\n\nSome niggas fake, catfish\n\nBitches switch, that quick\n\nRest in peace, ashes\n\nBest friend in a casket, mindframe changed drastic\n\nLearned to cherish today because tomorrow could be your last, shit\n\nHits the fan, niggas dying off of strips of xans\n\nPoison the water in Michigan, shit is different fam\n\nUh, some days it's hard for me stay up\n\nGotta shake this negativity, come on my nigga wake up\n\nWhat means the world to me, my son and my daughter\n\nAnd anyone threatens that order know that your life will get slaughtered, motherfucker\n\n\n\nWhat means the world to you?\n\nWhat means the world to you?\n\nWhat means the world?\n\nWhat means the world to you?\n\nWhat means the world to you?\n\nWhat means the world?"
