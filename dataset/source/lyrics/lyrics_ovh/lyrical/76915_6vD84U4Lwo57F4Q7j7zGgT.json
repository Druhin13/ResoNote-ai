  "lyrics": "I was twelve when Daddy said to me\rDon't take to drinking boy, that road don't lead to nowhere\rAnd don't you ever let me hear you swear...don't you dare\rHe told me stealing is a lazy man's way\rSomething for nothing leaves you hell to pay\rSo don't lie...then you can look the whole wold in the eye\r(Honey I try)\rBut since I met you girl, I'm breaking every rule\rI must confess I'm just a backsliding fool\rI want to drink from your lovin' cup\rSwear I'll never give you up\rSteal all your kisses underneath the moon\rI wanna lie here close to you, look what you made me do\rDarlin' you're the reason why\rI drink, swear, steal and lie\rLast night I threw away my twelve-step book\rI finally faced the fact that I am hooked on you\rThere's nothing more that I can do (ain't no use)\r'Cause every time I see your angel face\rMy halo disappears without a trace (I swear)\rGirl, I admit I haven't got a prayer (but I don't care)\rWell I know this ain't exactly how I was raised\rBut heaven help me honey I ain't changing my ways\rI want to drink from your lovin' cup\rSwear I'll never give you up\rSteal all your kisses underneath the moon\rI wanna lie here close to you, look what you made me do\rDarlin' you're the reason why\rI drink, swear, steal and lie\rI want to drink from your lovin' cup\rSwear I'll never give you up\rSteal all your kisses underneath the moon\rI wanna lie here close to you, look what you made me do\rDarlin' you're the reason why\rI drink, swear, steal and lie\rDrink, swear, steal and lie"
