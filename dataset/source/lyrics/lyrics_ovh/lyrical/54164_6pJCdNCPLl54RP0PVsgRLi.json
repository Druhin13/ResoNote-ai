  "lyrics": "If in one unfortunate moment\r\nYou took everything that I own\r\nEverything you've given from heaven above\r\nAnd everything that I've ever known\r\nIf you stripped away my ministry\r\nMy influence, my reputation\n\nMy health, my happiness\n\nMy friends, my pride and my expectation\n\nIf you caused for me to suffer\n\nOr to suffer for the cause of the cross\n\nIf the cost of my allegiance is prison\n\nAnd all my freedoms are lost\n\nIf you take the breath from my lungs\n\nAnd make an end of my life\n\nIf you take the most precious part of me\n\nAnd take my kids and my wife\n\nIt would crush me, it would break me\n\nIt would suffocate and cause heartache\n\nI would taste the bitter dark providence\n\nBut you would still preserve my faith\n\nWhat's concealed in the heart of having\n\nIs revealed in the losing of things\n\nAnd I can't even begin to imagine\n\nThe sting that kind of pain brings\n\nI would never blame you for evil\n\nEven if you caused me pain\n\nI came into this world with nothing\n\nAnd when I die it will be the same\n\nI will praise your name\n\nIn the giving and taking away\n\nIf I have you I can lose everything\n\nAnd still consider it gain\n\n\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word makes the difference\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word changes everything\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word makes the difference\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word changes everything\n\n\n\n(Everyone who trusts in you will not be put to shame)\n\nIf that's not what I believed\n\nThen why is that what I proclaim?\n\nIf it don't change how I live\n\nShould I still shout it just the same?\n\nIf I shout it as loud as I can\n\nWill blessings shower down\n\nFrom the heavens and land on my crown\n\nTo rinse away all my doubt?\n\nAnd the grace of God is only sweet\n\nTo the ears who hear the sound of it\n\nBut that sweetness won't be tasted\n\nBy the mouth of a counterfeit faith\n\nOnly the thirsty will drink from the fountain of life and count\n\nEverything as a loss for the sake of being found in Christ\n\nObedience to God's word is the safest foundation\n\nA safe haven for saints waiting for the glorious great day when\n\nOur saviour will return\n\nThat's the day of restoration\n\nThose who sleep will be awakened\n\nAnd we will never cease to thank him\n\nSinging \"worthy is the Lamb to receive glory and honour\"\n\nWorthy is the Lamb who reconciled us to our Father\n\nWorthy is the one who gives life without end\n\nBut if Christ is not raised then we are stlll in our sin\n\nIf...\n\n\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word makes the difference\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word changes everything\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word makes the difference\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word changes everything\n\n\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word makes the difference\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word changes everything\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word makes the difference\n\nIt could mean everything, it could mean nothing\n\nOne word changes everything"
