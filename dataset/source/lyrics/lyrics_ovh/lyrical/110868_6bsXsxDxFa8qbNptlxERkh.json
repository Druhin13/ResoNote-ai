  "lyrics": "I'm campin' outside your castle cryin'\r\nHopin' you see me here\r\nTonight I feel like a man on fire\r\nBut I'm in the cool night air\r\nI'm just a-waiting for day to break\n\nIs this love or just a mistake?\n\nI'm just a-waiting for day to break\n\nBaby, how long will it take?\n\nWaiting for day to break\n\n\n\nDo you love me, do you love me\n\nPut somebody else above me\n\nJust don't leave me here alone\n\nAphrodite, Aphrodite\n\nPut your body here beside me\n\n'Cause I'm burnin' all alone\n\n\n\nI'm just a-waiting for day to break\n\nIs this love or just a mistake?\n\nI'm just a-waiting for day to break\n\nBaby, how long will it take?\n\nWaiting for day to break\n\n\n\nShout at the mountains high, I'm prayin' that it finds your ear\n\nI'm at the guarding gate, take me in dear\n\nI collapse on the lawn, a guitar at my side\n\nAnd the diamonds of dawn in your eyes\n\n\n\nI'm out here on my own\n\nOn my own\n\nWhen you're breakin' the silence\n\nThe sun starts to rise\n\nIt's the first time that I felt alive\n\n\n\nI'm just a-waiting for day to break\n\nIs this love or just a mistake?\n\nI'm just a-waiting for day to break\n\nBaby, how long will it take?\n\nWaiting for day to break"
