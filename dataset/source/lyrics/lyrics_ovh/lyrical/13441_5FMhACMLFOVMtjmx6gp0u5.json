  "lyrics": "Got a dusty neck and a bent back load\r\nFeel the heat rise up off a red dark road\r\nUp ahead's just more the road not showing\r\nThat's a hundred miles that I'm going\r\nIt's a long way up and a long way back\n\nAin't no short cut and no side track\n\nAnd there ain’t no sign of a shade tree growing\n\nThat's a hundred miles that I'm going\n\n\n\nThat's a hundred miles to get back to you\n\nAnd a hundred years and maybe two\n\n\n\nSee the road stretch out to the old home place\n\nSee a glad tears standing on Grandma’s face\n\nGonna get some love and a big hello-ing\n\nThat's a hundred miles that I'm going\n\n\n\nThat's a hundred miles to get back to you\n\nThen a hundred years or maybe two\n\n\n\nGot a dusty neck and a bent back load\n\nFeel the heat rise up off a red dark road\n\nUp ahead's just more that the road not showing\n\nThat's a hundred miles that I'm going\n\n\n\nThat's a hundred miles that I'm going"
