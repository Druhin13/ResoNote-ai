  "lyrics": "Running thru fields of flowers and smoke\r\nLeaving behind all that we've built\r\nThe garden now ashes and the roof is caving in\r\nA broken how glass\r\nBlood running thin\n\nFor your life... come to my side\n\nFor your life... take me from here\n\n\n\nFor your life... open up your heart\n\nLet me hear your voice\n\nLet me hear you sing\n\n\n\nI wasn't on my way down to the marketplace\n\nWasn't at the schoolyard\n\nWhere our children play\n\nI wasn't in our home standing in the living room\n\nOr writing you a note that\n\nI'll be back soon\n\n\n\nFor your life... come to my side\n\nFor your life... take me from here\n\n\n\nFor your life... open up your heart\n\nLet me hear your voice\n\nLet me hear you sing\n\n\n\nOh, let me hear you sing\n\nLet me hear you sing\n\n\n\nI don't recognize myself that much anymore\n\nMemories in my pockets and coins on the floor\n\n\n\nAll I smell is smoke and all I ever see\n\nIs the look in you eyes\n\nThat look in you eyes\n\n\n\nFor your life... come to my side\n\nFor your life... take me from here\n\n\n\nFor your life... open up your heart\n\nFor your life... let me hear your voice\n\n\n\nFor your life... open up your heart\n\nFor your life... let me hear your voice\n\n\n\nOh, let me hear you sing\n\nLet me hear you sing"
