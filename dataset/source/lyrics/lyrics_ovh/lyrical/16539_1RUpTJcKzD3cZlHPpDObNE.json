  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson On Hold par Vacations\r\nThese feelings were overdue\nYou know that it's true\nKept out of sight from the foreground\nAs your heart has found\n\nYou didn't want this\nYou never meant this\nYou didn't want this\nYou never meant this\n\nWhat were you waiting for?\nYou kept yourself on hold for too long\nFor too long\n\nNothing was really there\nYou just stood and stared\n\nWhat you were missing, not what you had\nSuddenly it hits and you realise\n\nYou didn't want this\nYou never meant this\nYou didn't want this\nYou never meant this\n\nWhat were you waiting for?\nYou kept yourself on hold for too long\nFor too long"
