  "lyrics": "I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute\r\nAnd then I'll be nothing forever\r\nAnd all of my memories\r\nAnd all of the things I have seen will be gone\r\nWith my eyes with my body with me\n\nBut me and my husband\n\nWe are doing better\n\nIt's always been just him and me\n\nTogether\n\nSo I bet all I have on that\n\nFurrowed brow\n\nAnd at least in this lifetime\n\nWe're sticking together\n\nMe and my husband\n\nWe're sticking together\n\n\n\nAnd I'm the idiot with the painted face\n\nIn the corner, taking up space\n\nBut when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved\n\n\n\nMe and my husband\n\nWe are doing better\n\nIt's always been just him and me\n\nTogether\n\nSo I bet all I have on that\n\nFurrowed brow\n\nAnd at least in this lifetime\n\nWe're sticking together\n\nMe and my husband\n\nWe're sticking together\n\nMe and my husband\n\nWe are doing better"
