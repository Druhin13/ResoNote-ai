  "lyrics": "We're born with all the wonder we will ever have\r\nAnd we die with all we escaped with\r\nIn your eyes, stones I've seen in mine\r\nOnce in a while, all we escaped with\r\nAnd the pilot light flickers\n\nWhile I'm in charades\n\nAnd the pilot light flickers\n\nWhile I'm in charades\n\n\n\nI've been here thousand times before\n\nEvery new rule born from unknown scars\n\nCan you blame the young hunger\n\nThat falls into every soft head?\n\n\n\nAnd the pilot light flickers\n\nWhile I'm in charades\n\nAnd the pilot light flickers\n\nWhile I'm in charades\n\n\n\nAnd the pilot light flickers\n\nWhile I'm in charades\n\nAnd the pilot light flickers\n\nWhile I'm in charades"
