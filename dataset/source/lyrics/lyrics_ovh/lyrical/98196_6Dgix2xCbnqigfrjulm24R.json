  "lyrics": "Just like the kids I've been navigating my way\r\nThrough the mind-numbing reality of a godless existence\r\nWhich, at this point in my hollow and vapid life\r\nHas erased what little ambition I've got left\r\nAnd I've embraced the calamity\r\nWith an attachment and a passive disinterest\n\nLiving out the back of my '97 Camry\n\nWondering how the hell I got myself into this\n\n\n\nI guess it doesn't matter anyway\n\nI don't care about nothing but you\n\nI guess it doesn't matter anyway\n\n'Cause I don't care about nothing\n\nI don't care about nothing but you\n\nNo, I don't care about nothing\n\n\n\nShe said \"I'm sick of it all\n\nYour little games are getting old\n\nYour little songs are getting way too literal\n\nHow about some goddamn subtlety for a change?\"\n\nShe said \"I feel like I've come untethered\n\nIn a room without walls\n\nI'm drifting on the dark and empty sea of nothing\n\nIt doesn't feel bad, it feels like nothing at all\"\n\n\n\nI guess it doesn't matter anyway\n\nI don't care about nothing but you\n\nI guess it doesn't matter anyway\n\n'Cause I don't care about nothing\n\n\n\nAnd I had it maxed out\n\nI had a feeling, oh\n\nNothing is working\n\nAnd everything's bleeding, oh\n\nI should've tapped out\n\nGiven into my demons, oh\n\n\n\nIt's alright it's just a flesh wound\n\nYou said you'd never saw it coming\n\nI'm pretty happy lying here with you\n\nIt's pretty good to feel something\n\n\n\nI don't care about nothing but you\n\nNo, I don't care about nothing\n\nI don't care about nothing but you\n\nNo, I don't care about nothing\n\n\n\nAnd I had it maxed out\n\nI had a feeling, oh\n\nNothing is working\n\nAnd everything's bleeding, oh\n\nI should've tapped out\n\nGiven into my demons, oh\n\nAnd I had it maxed out (I had it maxed out)\n\nAnd nothing is working (Nothing is working)\n\nAnd everything's bleeding, oh"
