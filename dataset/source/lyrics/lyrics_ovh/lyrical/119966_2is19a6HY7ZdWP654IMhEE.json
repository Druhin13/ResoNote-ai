  "lyrics": "Hey you\r\nI'm just now leaving\r\nCan I come around later on this evening?\r\nOr do you need time?\r\nYes, of course, that's fine\r\nHey you\n\nGood morning\n\nI'm sure you're busy now, why else would you ignore me?\n\nOr do you need space?\n\nYou can't help it if your mind has changed\n\nSo go ahead and break my heart again\n\nLeave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in\n\nAre you the definition of insanity?\n\nOr am I?\n\nOh, it must be nice\n\nTo love someone who lets you break them twice\n\nYou're so blue\n\nAre you still breathing?\n\nWon't you tell me if you found that deeper meaning\n\nDo you think I've gone blind?\n\nI know it's not the truth when you say, \"I'm fine\"\n\nSo go ahead and break my heart again\n\nLeave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in\n\nAre you the definition of insanity?\n\nOr am I?\n\nOh, it must be nice\n\nTo love someone who lets you break them twice\n\nDon't pretend that I'm the instigator\n\nYou were the one, but you were born to say goodbye\n\nKissed me half a decade later\n\nThat same perfume, those same sad eyes\n\nGo ahead and break my heart again\n\nLeave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in\n\nAre you the definition of insanity?\n\nOr am I?\n\nOr am I?\n\nIt must be nice\n\nTo love someone who lets you break them twice"
