  "lyrics": "Climb into my corner, my self inflicted coma\r\nStand up, lay down, repeat in the same order\r\nFall straight through the floor and let the time just run me over\r\nAnother mirrored image corrupted and distorted\r\nI'm underwhelmed, uninterested, I wonder why I'm over it\r\nWalk it off, the kettle's black\n\nThe dotted line, the house is glass\n\n\n\n(The house is glass) The house is glass\n\n(The house is glass) The house is glass\n\n\n\nIt's an illusion, this admiration\n\nOf mutilation, my isolation\n\nIt's an illusion, this admiration\n\nOf mutilation, my isolation, my isolation\n\nMy isolation, it's an illusion\n\n\n\nSlide on down the staircase, that picture-perfect moment\n\nReceiver projected, act like if you own it\n\nSmile for the camera, repeat and do it over\n\nSmile for the camera, repeat and do it over\n\nJoke's on you, the needle prick\n\nCut me down, I need a break\n\nWalk it off, the kettle's black\n\nThe dotted line, this house is glass\n\n\n\n(The house is glass) The house is glass\n\n(The house is glass) The house is glass\n\n\n\nIt's an illusion, this admiration\n\nOf mutilation, my isolation\n\nIt's an illusion, this admiration\n\nOf mutilation, my isolation, my isolation\n\nMy isolation, it's an illusion\n\n\n\nBrick by brick\n\nMake it last\n\nHit that line\n\nThe house is glass\n\n\n\nIt's an illusion, my isolation\n\nMy isolation, my isolation\n\nIt's an illusion, it's an illusion\n\nMy isolation, my isolation, my isolation"
