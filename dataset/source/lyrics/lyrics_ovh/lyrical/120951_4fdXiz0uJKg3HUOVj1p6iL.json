  "lyrics": "Adrenaline pumping, heart pacer racing, altercations, we lit\r\nBlood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit\r\nSame hood, different day, same whip, different clip\r\nLetting off, somehow we end up in the same shit\r\nAnd she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason\n\nShe got herself inside of this situation in the first place\n\nBrooklyn murder lathers a birth place\n\nFacing the city, quoting Biggie on a worst days\n\nI used to take the train with her so none of these lames give her the danger\n\nLiving from where she was at was a plain picture\n\nI used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together\n\nInstead of listen, she just kinda blew me off\n\nPaid it no mind, but it kind of just threw me off\n\nI guess I figured out, everybody wants riches and the cars\n\nBut she just wanted a better family\n\nBecause her parents divorced early, her papa, he was taken by the force\n\nMother on crack and she never had time to bathe her\n\nThen she gave her to her uncle, her brother played the saviour\n\nUntil the day he started datin' this chick\n\nThat had put him up on mad pills and fucking up mad bills\n\nShe told me that one night he had got so fucked up\n\nHe fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona\n\nAnd walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothes\n\nAnd forcefully started choking her and telling her not to move\n\nBefore she could even finish, she rolled out in tears and did it\n\nTold me that for years, this night was a repetition of feeling a fear\n\nThat she couldn't seem exit or quit it, the feeling was there\n\nStarted talking lower and she told me come here\n\nShe said she had to make choices\n\nSo she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel\n\nRan off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel\n\nPut the burner to his face with this aim to kill\n\nAnd said, she don't fuck with niggas, 'cause niggas is the reason\n\nShe got herself inside of this situation in the first place\n\nFigured this intimidation was the worst case\n\nShe sat back and blew six in that boy face\n\n\n\n*gun shots*\n\nShot, him, dead\n\n\n\nI want you, my dear\n\nNo, I won't leave you lonely\n\nYou hold your head up high\n\nI won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely\n\nCan't leave you lonely\n\nCan't leave you lonely\n\nCan't leave you lonely\n\n\n\nHe don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason\n\nHe got himself inside of this situation in the first place\n\nHe had no father figure\n\nHe told me that his papa got shot in the face\n\nAnd he can't wait to find out who his killer\n\nHe dedicated his life and now wants to know who had a motive to kill his only father\n\nHe felt, it had to be somebody close\n\nIt couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know 'im\n\nBut take this pardon\n\nWhen he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin\n\nThe woman that used to show him the ropes\n\nShe used to tell him, don't ever let no nigga or woman touch her\n\nAnd if somebody do, then all they would hear is the baka baka baka baka\n\nOne day, he was on the block rolling\n\nThen, this crack fiend woman came up to him and told him\n\nThat she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen\n\nHe ain't want to believe her 'til she said, \"Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum\n\nA scar up on your eye, came from when you was four, from when you fell off in the road\"\n\nAt that point, he looked at her face and he froze\n\nShe told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him\n\nShe says to him, \"I was gon' wait until you got older\n\nBut something was on my mind, was pressing, I had to show you\n\nThe whole block know me and the whole block know you\n\nThe whole block been knew this story, but they ain't told you\"\n\nHis mom says to him, \"I hope you know your pap was a good man\n\nBut he just had some nonsense to him\n\nHuh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills\n\nI'm tryna tell him stop, but everything I'm saying fails\n\nYou see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn will be relieved\n\nI know she love you, but the story's more deeper\n\nUh, you see, your father used to be a creeper\n\nHe used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her\n\nUsed to leave her, so confused, she would lace an old poker and reefer\n\nWait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper\n\nYou've been living this mission\n\nYou tryna figure out who's the nigga or the perpetrator of killing your pops, nigga\n\nWhen your cousin is the reason, he got shot nigga\n\nShe put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga\"\n\nThis angle was dwelling all on his mind\n\nHe didn't know what to do, he started gripping his nine and uh\n\nBefore he knew, he aimed it up at his momma and uh\n\nHe shot her right in his spine, he said\n\n\"This is why, my life has been full of lies\n\nDon't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in trying?\n\nThis Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind\n\nI know that I'ma die, but in Heaven, I'd be alive\"\n\n\n\nAdrenaline pumping, heart pacer racing, altercations, we lit\n\nBlood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit\n\nSame hood, different day, same whip, different clip\n\nLetting off, somehow we end up in the same shit\n\n\n\nStunt, get jumped on, slash the dumped-ons\n\nSame block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on\n\nTory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy\n\nA little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby\n\nHow much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break?\n\nLove turn to hate?\n\nFuck shit or fake, you next move may raise the murder rate\n\nFrom average to savage, to semi-automatics\n\nIt's tragic how the static'll have us going at it\n\n\n\nI want you, my dear\n\nNo, I won't leave you lonely\n\nYou hold your head up high\n\nI won't let go 'cause I can't leave you lonely\n\nCan't leave you lonely\n\nCan't leave you lonely\n\nCan't leave you lonely"
