  "lyrics": "Called to the ring\r\nTaking me round by round\r\nIt hurts and it stings\r\nTaking me down, down, down\r\nYou think that you caught me\n\nI can hear you taunt me\n\nFractured and I'm falling down\n\nMy enemy is watching me bleed\n\n\n\nBut I'm not dead yet, so watch me burn\n\nGo trying, lying, you're so sure\n\nI may be broken, but I'm not done\n\nI'll go fighting while this breath in my lungs\n\n'Cause I'm not dead yet\n\nNo, I'm not dead yet\n\n\n\nLook for the day\n\nThat I'll be counted out\n\nYou stand at my grave\n\nAlready breaking ground\n\n\n\nBut I don't think you know me\n\nThere's a side you don't see\n\nBeen to hell and made it out\n\nMy enemy, I watch you bleed\n\n\n\nBut I'm not dead yet, so watch me burn\n\nGo trying, lying, you're so sure\n\nI may be broken, but I'm not done\n\nI'll go fighting while this breath in my lungs\n\n'Cause I'm not dead yet\n\nNo, I'm not dead yet\n\n\n\nI'm still awake\n\nI won't go away\n\nIt's gonna take my body\n\nYou can break\n\nCalling my name\n\nHeaven is calling my name\n\n\n\nBut I'm not dead yet, so watch me burn\n\nGo trying, lying, you're so sure\n\nI may be broken, but I'm not done\n\nI'll go fighting while this breath in my lungs\n\n'Cause I'm not dead yet\n\nNo, I'm not dead yet\n\n\n\nI'm still awake\n\nI won't go away\n\nIt's gonna take my body you can break"
