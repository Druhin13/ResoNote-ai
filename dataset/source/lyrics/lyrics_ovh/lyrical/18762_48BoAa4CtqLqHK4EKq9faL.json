  "lyrics": "I looked at you, girl, I saw a smile\r\nFor my love, you said you'd walk a mile\r\nToday I see your face, you wear a frown\r\nNow you're telling me that I'm a clown\r\nWhat's the reason for this sudden change?\r\nI never thought you'd act so strange\n\n\n\nYou say that I'm a boy and we should part\n\nSo you can go and make a brand new start\n\nYou laughed at me and then I almost cried\n\nYou hurt my heart so bad I had to hide\n\nWhat's the reason for this sudden change?\n\nI never thought that you would act so strange\n\n\n\nI'm gettin' tired of listenin' to you talk\n\nI think I'll go outside and take a walk\n\nTook my guitar and got up off the floor\n\nI must have dozed off while you were next door\n\n\n\nMy mind's at ease now I know that you're on my side\n\nThat ice cold daydream took me for an ugly ride"
