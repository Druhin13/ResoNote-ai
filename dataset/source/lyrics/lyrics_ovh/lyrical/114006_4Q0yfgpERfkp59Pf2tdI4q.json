  "lyrics": "I turn the music up, I got my records on\r\nI shut the world outside until the lights come on\r\nMaybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone\r\nI feel my heart start beating to my favourite song\r\nAnd all the kids they dance, all the kids all night\n\nUntil Monday morning feels another life\n\nI turn the music up\n\nI'm on a roll this time\n\nAnd heaven is in sight\n\n\n\nuh...\n\n\n\nI turn the music up, I got my records on\n\nFrom underneath the rubble sing a rebel song\n\nDon't want to see another generation drop\n\nI'd rather be a comma than a full stop\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees\n\nMaybe I'm in the gap batween the two trapezes\n\nBut my heart is beating and my pulses start\n\nCathedrals in my heart\n\n\n\nas we saw oh this light \n\nI swear you, emerge blinking into\n\nTo tell me it's alright\n\nAs we soar walls, \n\nevery siren is a symphony\n\nAnd every tear's a waterfall\n\nIs a waterfall\n\nOh\n\nIs a waterfall\n\nOh oh oh\n\nIs a is a waterfall\n\nEvery tear\n\nIs a waterfall\n\nOh oh oh\n\n\n\nSo you can hurt, hurt me bad\n\nBut still I'll raise the flag\n\n\n\nOh\n\nIt was a wa wa wa wa wa-a-terfall\n\nA wa wa wa wa wa-aterfall\n\n\n\nEvery tear\n\nEvery tear\n\n\n\nEvery teardrop is a waterfall\n\n\n\nEvery tear\n\nEvery tear\n\n\n\nEvery teardrop is a waterfall"
