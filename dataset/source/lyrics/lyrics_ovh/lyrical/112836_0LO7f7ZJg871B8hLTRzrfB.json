  "lyrics": "Straighten my sweater, fix my spine\r\nStep up in line, I'm ordering food high\r\nAnd I don't know why\r\nI'm so nervous I won't make it\r\n'Cause that's my favorite waitress\r\nThose big brown eyes\n\nI don't know what I ordered\n\nBut you're smiling like I can't afford it\n\nOoh\n\n\n\nAddicted to TED talks\n\nWaiting for lift off\n\nBut I didn't know it if it's doing much\n\n'Cause I just lost my mind\n\nIn the fluorescent lights of my life\n\nIn my mind, a river running free like rabbits\n\n\n\nBut Julia\n\nFix me a blue sky in the world sun\n\nAnd i'll be back now\n\nJulia\n\nHow long, how long till I'm all gone?\n\n'Cause here I am\n\n\n\nJust stumbling down\n\nElysian Fields\n\nA spanish moss\n\nAnd a sudden feel\n\nSilver moonlight in the trees\n\nAnd the devil's in my bloodstream\n\nDon't say you love the old me\n\n\n\nJust stumbling down Elysian Fields\n\nYour vision coming clear\n\nAnd I don't know where home is\n\nAnd the doors wide open\n\n\n\nJulia\n\nHow long, how long, how long, oh lord, oh lord\n\nJulia\n\nHow long, how long till it's all gone?\n\nHow long, how long?\n\n'Cause you deserve a man to lead you in\n\nBut here I am just stumbling down Elysian Fields again"
