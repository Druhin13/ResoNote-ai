(serious)\n\nSomething in the air is dangerous (dangerous)\n\nEverybody here is watching us\n\n\n\nWe're just bodies, we're just bodies in the night\n\nMove your bodies, move your bodies in the light\n\nTrust nobody, trust nobody in the fight\n\nWe're just bodies, we are bodies in the night\n\n\n\nWe are bodies in the night\n\nWe are bodies in the night\n\nBodies in the night\n\n\n\nWe are bodies in the night"
