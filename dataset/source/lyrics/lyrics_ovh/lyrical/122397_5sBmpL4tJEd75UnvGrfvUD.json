  "lyrics": "On a desert Christmas morning, 1981\r\nOne month shy of six years old\r\nIn the valley of the sun\r\nMy first two-wheel bicycle stood by the tree\r\nMy heart thumping in my chest\r\nThough I'd tried, I couldnâ€™t ride one yet\n\n\n\nOut on our street when my dad let go of the seat\n\nI rode off and down the road\n\nSomehow I never went back home\n\n\n\nBut I remember what it was like\n\nAstride my yellow bike\n\nFirst freedom, second life\n\nAll the places I could ride\n\nLeaving early packing light\n\nThat little ache inside\n\nMy kingdom for someone to ride with\n\n\n\nNow a highwayman who traded in his handlebars\n\nGoing back and forth\n\nIn vans and rental cars\n\nOn the 10, the 5, the 90, and the 95\n\nIn love with every stretch of road\n\nBut when I drive them on my own\n\n\n\nThey remind me what it was like\n\nAstride that yellow bike\n\nMy kingdom for someone\n\n\n\nSome folks are loners\n\nAnd you learn from them\n\nIf you've always been a joiner\n\nOn the move again\n\nBut if you keep your legs pumping\n\nDespite everything\n\nWell, you can take that sting\n\nYou can make it swing\n\n\n\nJust remember what it was like\n\nAstride that yellow bike\n\nFirst freedom, second life\n\nAll the places I could ride\n\nLeaving early packing light\n\nThat little ache inside\n\nMy kingdom for someone to ride with\n\nI'd trade my kingdom for someone to ride with"
