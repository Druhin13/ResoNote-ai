  "lyrics": "See those fault lines\r\nLay down like land mines\r\nIt's hard to relax\r\nA promise broken\r\nThe ground breaks open\r\nLove falls through the cracks\n\nAnd I've got a few of my own\n\nI've got a few of my own fault lines\n\nRunning under my life\n\nRunning under my life\n\nI'm alone here\n\nI play the odds, dear\n\nI go where I please\n\nDown the road\n\nA man I know might not be me\n\nAnd I've got a few of my own\n\nI've got a few of my own fault lines\n\nRunning under my life\n\nRunning under my life\n\nA faulty table\n\nStill is able not to fall flat\n\nAnd I've got a few of my own\n\nI've got a few of my own fault lines\n\nRunning under my life\n\nRunning under my life"
