  "lyrics": "Waiting for an Indian summer\r\nFor the time we lost, to come alive\r\nKiss me and my body will shudder\r\nSeptember skies electrified\r\nI’ve been waiting here a 100 nights\n\nWatching everybody drink our wine\n\nAnd I’ve been wondering why\n\nI didn’t have you by my side\n\n\n\nCan you give me an encore, one more to end the show\n\nI didn’t get what I came for, came for, the afterglow\n\nShow me what it takes for the dead to rise\n\nJust say the word and I’ll paint the skies\n\nFor an Indian summer\n\nTo come alive\n\n\n\nPraying love will never go under\n\nA harvest moon to light the skies\n\nAutumn leaves one after another\n\nYou make me watch the flowers dry\n\n\n\nI’ve been waiting here a 100 nights\n\nWatching everybody drink our wine\n\nI’ve been wondering why\n\nI didn’t have you by my side\n\n\n\nCan you give me an encore, one more, to end the show\n\nI didn’t get what I came for, came for, the afterglow\n\nShow me what it takes for the dead to rise\n\nJust say the word and I’ll paint the skies\n\nFor an Indian summer\n\nTo come alive\n\nTo come alive\n\n\n\nShow me what it takes for the dead to rise\n\nJust say the word and I’ll paint the skies\n\nFor an Indian summer to come alive"
