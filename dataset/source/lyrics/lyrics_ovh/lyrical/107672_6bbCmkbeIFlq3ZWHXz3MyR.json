  "lyrics": "God sent his only son to save us\r\nHe died upon a cross for all our sin\r\nI praise the precious name of Jesus\r\nHe walked out of the grave they laid him in\r\nI serve a Savior\n\nIt's what I was made for\n\nHis grace and love I don't deserve\n\nI will be faithful\n\nHumble and grateful\n\nMy life is greater 'cause I serve a Savior\n\n\n\nThis world can be so full of heartache\n\nThe pain, it causes cuts just like a knife\n\nAw, but the Bible says \"The one who loves his life will lose it\n\n\"And the one who hates his life in this world will keep it, for eternal life\n\n\"If anyone serves me, he must follow me\n\n\"Where I am, there my servant will also be\n\n\"If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him\"\n\n\n\nI serve a Savior\n\nIt's what I was made for\n\nHis grace and love I don't deserve\n\nI will be faithful\n\nHumble and grateful\n\nMy life is greater 'cause I serve a Savior\n\nMy life is greater 'cause I serve a Savior"
