  "lyrics": "Looking out on the river bend\r\nLooking out on the thing that isn't\r\nLooking out on the freeway's push and pull\r\nLooking out for the current\r\nLittle spells of forgetfulness\r\nLittle sounds that are shrill and urgent\n\nLittle insects that sting as they come and go\n\nLittle moments of purpose\n\n\n\nI loved you\n\nI wore you out\n\nI missed you\n\nWhere are you now?\n\n\n\nThis town is a monolith\n\nThis town is a crowded movie\n\nThis town is a depot, I come and go\n\nThis town is my city\n\n\n\nI hate you\n\nI tore you down\n\nI miss you\n\nWhere are you now?\n\n\n\nLooking bad like those Vegas odds\n\nWear a smile like it's camouflage\n\n\n\nToday was a smoking sky\n\nToday was a civic menace\n\nToday I went walking while things explode\n\nSome sad independence\n\n\n\nI want to be just as loud\n\nAll this freedom just freaks me out\n\n\n\nRisk it all on the game of chance\n\nChasing love like an ambulance"
