  "lyrics": "Time, time, time\r\nSee what's become of me\r\nTime, time, time\r\nSee what's become of me\r\nWhile I looked around for my possibilities\n\nI was so hard to please\n\n\n\nLook around\n\nLeaves are brown\n\nAnd the sky is a hazy shade of winter\n\n\n\nHear the salvation army band\n\nDown by the riverside\n\nIt's bound to be a better ride\n\nThan what you've got planned\n\nCarry your cup in your hand\n\n\n\nLook around\n\nLeaves are brown\n\nAnd the sky is a hazy shade of winter\n\n\n\n\"Hang on to your hopes, my friend\"\n\nThat's an easy thing to say\n\nBut if your hope should pass away\n\nSimply pretend\n\nThat you can build them again\n\n\n\nLook around\n\nGrass is high\n\nFields are ripe\n\nIt's the springtime of my life\n\n\n\nSeasons change with the scenery\n\nWeaving time in a tapestry\n\nWon't you stop and remember me?\n\n\n\nLook around\n\nLeaves are brown\n\nAnd the sky is a hazy shade of winter\n\nLook around\n\nLeaves are brown\n\nThere's a patch of snow on the ground\n\nLook around\n\nLeaves are brown\n\nThere's a patch of snow on the ground\n\nLook around\n\nLeaves are brown\n\nThere's a patch of snow on the ground"
