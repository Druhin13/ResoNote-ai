  "lyrics": "Your voice is an echo of the voices in my mind\r\nYou're talking low and life ain't [on?] the wrong side of the line\r\nTake me back to way last [year?] when summer made us [sigh?]\r\nDo you remember why\r\nThe midnight sun was beating down on everyone but us\n\nSee I gotta chill that I can't shake and I think it's from your touch\n\nI'm waiting for the clocks to turn so the sun won't blind my eyes\n\nDo you remember why\n\n\n\nI'm not the first one in this town to come under your spell\n\nYou come on strong and stick around and you think you mean well\n\nAnd if I got the wrong idea then I apologize\n\nAnd I remember why\n\n\n\nI remember\n\nIn a late night taxi\n\nBackseat (.....)\n\nCity lights go by me\n\nYour hands on my knee\n\nBut it means nothing\n\nI know it means nothing\n\n\n\nI know it means nothing\n\n\n\nYou wanna take me out tonight, you wanna (.....) around\n\nBourbon by the bottle you wanna close it down\n\nBut when the last call lights come up, you go home to your wife\n\nAnd you remember why"
