  "lyrics": "She's black and red and built just like a spy plane\r\nExtracting information from my mind\r\nThe photographs she takes save to a mainframe\r\nFor your eyes only lonely cold war time (of mine)\r\nNow after all the city falls just like the night or an angel does\n\n\n\nLeave me here alone to collect my things\n\nShe sees music in the terror she brings\n\nAnd like a Technicolor dream\n\nThe light in your eyes blinded me\n\nFrom your perch you softly smiled\n\nMy Blackbird softly smiled\n\n\n\nShe's built for speed and made for keeping secrets\n\nStark and dark against enemy skies\n\nFrom miles above the earth no one can detect her\n\nMy Blackbird blows a kiss that ends mankind (goodbye)\n\n\n\nAnd all this time there is no crime of treason that she hasn't seen\n\n\n\nLeave me here alone to collect my things\n\nShe sees music in the terror she brings\n\nAnd like a Technicolor dream\n\nThe light in your eyes blinded me\n\nFrom your perch you softly smiled\n\nMy Blackbird softly smiled\n\n\n\nSR 71\n\nBlackbird from the hell above\n\nShe's the only one\n\nOnly spy I ever loved\n\nShe's the only spy I ever loved\n\n\n\nNow after all the city falls just like the night or an angel does\n\n\n\nLeave me here alone to collect my things\n\nShe sees music in the terror she brings\n\nAnd like a Technicolor dream\n\nThe light in your eyes blinded me\n\nFrom your perch you softly smiled\n\nMy Blackbird softly smiled\n\n\n\nSR 71\n\nBlackbird from the hell above\n\nShe's the only one\n\nOnly spy I ever loved"
