  "lyrics": "I'm talking to myself\r\nI know we're going down\r\nThere's whiskey on your lips\r\nBut you won't hear me out\r\nI'm talking to myself\r\nLike I'm going insane\n\nYou won't hear me out\n\nWhy do I still feel this way?\n\n\n\nI realise that I've been running from the truth\n\nHad the cards in my hand in a suit\n\nMade a farse but an act was a cue, girl\n\nEight shots deep in a birthday suit\n\nI'm a player that got played like a flute\n\nShe painted love in my head in a fruit\n\nTook me so high with no parachute\n\nScreamed the whole way down but I feel so mute now\n\nI'm the one who's tryna weigh you back to back\n\nGive everything and made you miss the past\n\nI wouldn't press the brakes, you didn't ht the gas\n\nIt's funny how the stand still made a collision fast\n\nYou try say you're sick of me like stress bro\n\nThen asking me to hang out, baby, yes no\n\nHow about we grab a last meal like death row?\n\nMaybe then I could finally learn how to let go, damn\n\n\n\nI'm talking to myself\n\nI know we're going down\n\nThere's whiskey on your lips\n\nBut you won't hear me out\n\nI'm talking to myself\n\nLike I'm going insane\n\nYou won't hear me out\n\nWhy do I still feel this way?\n\n\n\nSix shots in, I got missed calls\n\nKarma really is a bitch whenever it calls\n\nBloody knuckles from punching out brick walls\n\nLike what the fuck is this for? I ain't talking straight malls\n\nHeard you put up thick walls, I came in with a sledge shot\n\nI put you in a pen house, you put me on a ledge\n\nSince you are either pissed of, you put me on edge\n\nYou gave me cold feet, you walking through my head\n\nEven took away my breath\n\nNow I'm suffocating\n\nAlways under pressure and it's over taking\n\nPut in all this effort, you disregard I'm making\n\nOnly get your pleasure when my back is breaking\n\nFrom the weight you expect me to carry\n\nLike \"Ryan, you happy?\" I'm very\n\n'Cause if I said our love is buried\n\nHow quick you ghost it, it's scary\n\nSo I'l keep on swallowing pride till I'm drowned in you\n\nSo full of shit, how your stomach is growling\n\nSaid all that I hear in my ears is the pounding\n\nAnd my heart gives every alarm, it's been sounding\n\nYou put all these walls up, I thought it's your house\n\nBut we're fine in public, that shit is astounding\n\nThat's why I'm so lonely when we're up in crowd\n\n'Cause that's when the people don't hear that we're shouting\n\n\n\nI'm talking to myself\n\nI know we're going down\n\nThere's whiskey on your lips\n\nBut you won't hear me out\n\nI'm talking to myself\n\nLike I'm going insane\n\nYou won't hear me out\n\nWhy do I still feel this way?\n\n\n\nYou bang my line when it's half past nine and I might just blow my brain\n\n[?] , girl, I might just go Cobain\n\nGo ahead, take eight shots\n\nAll the drinks you bought, make sure you feel no pain\n\nEvery time you bitch you might burn that bridge\n\nYou be the match, I'll be the propane"
