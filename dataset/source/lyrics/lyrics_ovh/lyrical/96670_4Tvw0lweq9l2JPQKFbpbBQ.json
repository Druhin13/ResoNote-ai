  "lyrics": "I got pain from my waist up\r\nAnd I'll wake up and I'll take drugs\r\nAnd I say stuff that I'll make up, like \"I hate love\"\r\nAnd I hate that I can't lie, couldn't hate you if I tried\r\nIt'll suck for a week then, hurt more on a weekend\r\nWhen I go out and see your friends\n\nAnd I don't know what to tell 'em\n\nI can't lie, couldn't hate you if I tried\n\n\n\nI'm coming around to see ya, coming around to leave ya\n\nWhat is the point of hoping when it's already broken?\n\nIt hurts to let you go but it's worse to hold on\n\nBut I know that I'll be better when you're gone\n\nSaid I know that I'll be better when you're gone\n\n\n\nWhen you're gone\n\nSaid I know that I'll be better when you're gone\n\n\n\nYou gave me just eighty\n\nWhen I needed all hundred percent of you lately\n\nIt's obvious you don't even try, you don't even try\n\n\n\nI'm coming around to see ya, coming around to leave ya\n\nWhat is the point of hoping when it's already broken?\n\nIt hurts to let you go but it's worse to hold on\n\nBut I know that I'll be better when you're gone\n\nSaid I know that I'll be better when you're gone\n\n\n\nWhen you're gone\n\nSaid I know that I'll be better when you're gone\n\nSaid I know that I'll be better when you're gone"
