  "lyrics": "Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time\rThere's something wrong here\rThere can be no denying\rOne of us is changing\rOr maybe we've just stopped trying\rAnd it's too late baby\rNow it's too late\rThough we really did try to make it\rSomething inside has died\rAnd I can't hide\rAnd I just can't fake it\rNo no no no...\rIt used to be so easy living here with you\rYou were light and breezy\rAnd I knew just what to do\rNow you look so unhappy\rAnd I feel like a fool\rBut it's too late baby\rNow it's too late\rThough we really did try to make it\rSomething inside has died\rAnd I can't hide\rAnd I just can't fake it\rThere'll be a time just for me and you\rBut we just can't stay together\rDon't you feel it too\rStill I'm glad for what we had\rAnd how I once loved you\rAnd it's too late baby\rNow it's too late\rThough we really did try to make it\rSomething inside has died\rAnd I can't hide\rAnd I just can't fake it\rToo late, baby, it's too late\rDarling, it's too late"
