  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Silent Mutiny par Visions of Atlantis\r\nYou've been misguided and you've been deceived\nTruth was not always quite what you believed\nTrust has made fools out of great men before\nNow we will even the score...\n\nCome board our ship\nFeel the breeze\nThat is cleansing your heart and your soul\nWe will set you free !\n\nRun away, from the lies\nFrom the truth that blinds your eyes\nBreak the chains, spark the fire in your mind\n\nSing our song, join the fight\nAs we stand for what is right\n\nBe the change you want to see today\nJoin the Silent Mutiny\n\nWe are the rebels we think for ourselves\nSome men can rule but no men shall be slaves\nA free heart, a free mind is changing the game\nThe world shall never be the same\n\nCome taste our freedom !\n\nRun away, from the lies\nFrom the truth that blinds your eyes\nBreak the chains, spark the fire in your mind\n\nSing our song, join the fight\nAs we stand for what is right\nBe the change you want to see today\nJoin the Silent Mutiny\n\n\nFor power and money, the higher the walls\nThe tyrants would build at our doors\nFor balance and justice, we hope for a chance...\nSomeday we'll all know it lies in our hands\n\nCome board our ship\nFeel the breeze\nThat is cleansing your heart and your soul\nWe will set you free !\n\nRun away, from the lies\nFrom the truth that blinds your eyes\nBreak the chains, spark the fire in your mind\n\nSing our song, join the fight\nAs we stand for what is right\nBe the change you want to see today\n\nJoin the Silent Mutiny"
