  "lyrics": "See, they're making a fountain\r\nTell the truth that you'll never know\r\nWe were hiding all we had\r\nIn the hope that it'll never show\r\nThough the daytime can't decide\n\nLet the nighttime show the way\n\nWe've been trying to break on out\n\nBut if only you could\n\n\n\nSee, never mind you and me\n\nWatching the world turn endlessly\n\nTaking me where I wanna be\n\n\n\nBut see, it's bigger than you and me\n\nWatching the world turn endlessly\n\nFollow along and step with me\n\n\n\nKeep the only time we had\n\nTake a deal that we never made\n\nAlways hanging on your words\n\nWatching over every game we play\n\n\n\nThough the nighttime can't decide\n\nLet the daytime show the way\n\nWe've been trying to break on out\n\nBut if only you could\n\n\n\nSee, never mind you and me\n\nWatching the world turn endlessly\n\nTaking me where I wanna be\n\n\n\nBut see, it's bigger than you and me\n\nWatching the world turn endlessly\n\nFollow along and step with me\n\n\n\nSee, never mind you and me\n\nWatching the world turn endlessly\n\nTaking me where I wanna be\n\n\n\nBut see, it's bigger than you and me\n\nWatching the world turn endlessly\n\nFollow along and step with me"
