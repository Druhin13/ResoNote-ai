  "lyrics": "I learned back when I was young\r\nBe who you are and know where you're from\r\nAnd we ain't got to be just alike\r\nNot everything is black or white\r\nAll guitars don't sound the same\n\nCan't judge whiskey by the bottle\n\nIt might go against the grain of that country boy motto\n\nSometimes what you get ain't always what you see\n\nAll fields ain't corn, and all tractors ain't green\n\n\n\nKind of like the cover in a book\n\nI might sound a little different than I look\n\nAnd I ain't afraid of standin' out\n\nAnd after all these years yeah I know now\n\nI know now that\n\n\n\nAll guitars don't sound the same\n\nCan't judge whiskey by the bottle\n\nIt might go against the grain of that country boy motto\n\nSometimes what you get ain't always what you see\n\nAll fields ain't corn, and all tractors ain't green\n\nNo no\n\nAll tractors ain't green\n\nAll tractors ain't green\n\nAll guitars don't sound the same\n\nCan't judge whiskey by the bottle\n\n\n\nWe ain't gotta be just alike\n\nAnd not everything is black and white\n\nOh yeah\n\n\n\n'Cause all guitars don't sound the same\n\nCan't judge whiskey by the bottle\n\nIt might go against the grain of that country boy motto\n\nSometimes what you get ain't always what you see\n\nAll fields ain't corn, and all tractors ain't green\n\n\n\nAll guitars don't sound the same\n\nCan't judge whiskey by the bottle\n\nIt might go against the grain of that country boy motto\n\nSometimes what you get ain't always what you see\n\nAll fields ain't corn, and all tractors ain't green\n\n\n\nNo all tractors ain't, all tractors ain't green"
