  "lyrics": "Baby, you say it takes you years before you trust someone\r\nBut I don’t know how long there’s got if this has just begun\r\nBecause I know that…\r\nI'll only letting you down\r\nI'll only letting you down\n\nAnd I know it’s hard, leaving it all behind\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\n\n\nI hear your voice it calls me out, the words I never speak\n\nLike all the books you gave me, that I still have yet to read\n\nIf you only you knew where the pages beat, oh yeah\n\nBecause honestly I, will hold on and heal\n\nI never intend to be, ‘cause…\n\n\n\nI'll only letting you down\n\nI'll only letting you down\n\nAnd I know it’s hard leaving it all behind\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\n\n\nI’ll only letting you down\n\nI’ll only letting you down\n\nAnd I know it’s hard leaving it all behind\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down\n\nBut I know, I’ll only let you down"
