  "lyrics": "The drumbeat never changes tempo\r\nIt's steady like a rock\r\nAnd like a rock it crushes you as it gets louder\r\nThe drum gets louder and louder\r\nAnd you know there is no parking on the dance floor\n\nAnd when you wake up you can feel your hair grow\n\nCrawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow\n\nCreep across the ground until the day is done\n\nAll the while the planet circles 'round the sun\n\nEverybody knows how this goes so let's get over it\n\nAnd let's get this over with\n\n\n\nEven when you're out of work you still have a job to do\n\nEven when you don't know what it is\n\nYour job knows what it is\n\nWhat it is is it's coming to get you\n\nI'm talking to myself even when I'm saying \"you\"\n\n\n\nAnd when you wake up you can feel your hair grow\n\nCrawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow\n\nCreep across the ground until the day is done\n\nAll the while the planet circles 'round the sun\n\nEverybody knows how this goes so let's get over it\n\nAnd let's get this over with\n\n\n\nAfter all the spelling mistakes\n\nAfter all the groping in the dark\n\nCan this page of strange gibberish\n\nGet a final punctuation mark?\n\n\n\nYou're still hanging around the clambake\n\nAfter every clam has been baked\n\nNo applause\n\nAwkward pause\n\nHand extended waiting for a shake\n\n\n\nAnd when you wake up you can feel your hair grow\n\nCrawl out of your cave and you can watch your shadow\n\nCreep across the ground until the day is done\n\nAll the while the planet circles 'round the sun\n\nEverybody knows how this goes so let's get over it\n\nAnd let's get this over with\n\n\n\nHurry up and let's get this over with\n\nYou don't have to go home but you can't stay here\n\nEverybody knows how this goes so let's get over it\n\nAnd let's get this over with"
