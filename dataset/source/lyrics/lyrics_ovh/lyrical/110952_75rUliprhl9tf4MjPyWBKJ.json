  "lyrics": "This time around has it gone so grey that my faith can't hold out?\r\nHaven't you heard there's a somber wind gets my head away now\r\nHallowed be thy name, had you come to claim it?\r\nToo hard, too hard\r\nAll upon her face were the lost and strange years\n\nIt's too hard, too hard\n\n\n\nI don't wanna try no longer your songbird singing the darkest hour of the night\n\nI don't wanna find that I've been marching under the crueler side of the fight\n\nIt makes me want to cry\n\n\n\nWell I won't tell, the halfway blues hang on\n\nSure enough a sorry angel\n\nHurrying a song on her way\n\n\n\nThis time around has it gone so grey that my faith can't hold out?\n\nHaven't you heard there's a somber wind gets my head away now\n\n\n\nHallowed be thy name, had you come to claim it?\n\nToo hard, too hard\n\nAll upon her face were the lost and strange years\n\nToo hard, too hard\n\n\n\nI don't wanna try no longer your songbird singing the darkest hour of the night\n\nI don't wanna find that I've been marching under the crueler side of the fight\n\nIt makes me want to cry\n\n\n\nWell I won't tell, the halfway blues hang on\n\nSure enough a sorry angel\n\nHurrying a song on her way"
