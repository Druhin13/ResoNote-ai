  "lyrics": "Carry on my wayward son,\r\nthere'll be peace when you are done\r\nLay your weary head to rest\r\nDon't you cry no more\r\nOnce I rose above the noise and confusion\n\nJust to get a glimpse beyond this illusion\n\nI was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high\n\nThough my eyes could see I still was a blind man\n\nThough my mind could think I still was a mad man\n\nI hear the voices when I'm dreamin',\n\nI can hear them say\n\n\n\nCarry on my wayward son,\n\nthere'll be peace when you are done\n\nLay your weary head to rest\n\nDon't you cry no more\n\n\n\nMasquerading as a man with a reason\n\nMy charade is the event of the season\n\nAnd if I claim to be a wise man but , it surely\n\nmeans that I don't know\n\nOn a stormy sea of moving emotion\n\nTossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean\n\nI set a course for winds of fortune, but\n\nI hear the voices say\n\n\n\nCarry on my wayward son,\n\nthere'll be peace when you are done\n\nLay your weary head to rest\n\nDon't you cry no more\n\n\n\nCarry on, you will always remember\n\nCarry on, nothing equals the splendor\n\nNow your life's no longer empty\n\nSurely heaven waits for you\n\n\n\nCarry on my wayward son,\n\nthere'll be peace when you are done\n\nLay your weary head to rest\n\nDon't you cry no more"
