  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Noble Gas par Steve Aoki\r\nSome people want to go live on Mars, you don't wanna live on Mars\nYou wanna explore Mars\nIf we were to discover evidence of life on Mars, it would change the course of human history\nIt would be like Copernicus, discovering that the Earth goes around the sun\nIt would be like Galileo, showing that the moon is not a perfect circle\nMoon’s full of craters\nSo why would the many other scientific discoveries that humans have made\nWe found out that atoms hook together to make molecules\nSome atoms don't hook together, they don't, they don’t interact with other atoms\n\nAnd these are what we call the noble elements, or the noble gases\nYou know what the future is? Future is neon\nTopic number ten, it's a neon future\n\nIt's a neon future"
