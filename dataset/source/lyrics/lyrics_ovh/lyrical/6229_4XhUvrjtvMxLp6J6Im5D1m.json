  "lyrics": "This, is this the song\nFrom all the rooftops\nAnd all the ramparts\nThat our lonely lives are whole\nThat our tiny hearts are full\nBe the voice that echoes far\n\nHope is just above the bluest stars\n\n\n\nSee how they burn like sky fires\n\nTheyâ€™re watching\n\nAll our ships on bellowed seas\n\nWere we were running from his reach\n\nWe were afraid of how he showed\n\nThat love was broken and alone\n\n\n\nThis, is this the song\n\nFrom all the rooftops\n\nAnd all the ramparts\n\nBe the voice that echoes far\n\nHope is just above the bluest stars"
