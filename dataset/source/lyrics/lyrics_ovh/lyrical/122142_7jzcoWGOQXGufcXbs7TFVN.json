  "lyrics": "And I know where I'm going to\r\nI'm looking in Longevity's eyes\r\nI play with Infinity's mind, Forever's my guy\r\nMy pedigree above you ass, you'll never see I\r\nI love the past, but see, where I'm goin' I get to fly\n\nNever sold a record for the beat, it's my verses they purchase\n\nWithout production, I'm worthless but I'm more than the surface\n\nWant me to sound like every song on the Top 40\n\nI'm not for you, you not for me, you bore me\n\nI drop lines prestigious schools read to their students\n\nLook at my album plaques, somebody agrees with the music\n\nWas lovin' women, you'll never see\n\nAll you knows my kids' mothers, some celebrities\n\nDamn, look at the jealousy\n\nLucky me, I meet some beauties, make you wanna shoot me\n\nHate to brag, my worst batch kills off your best cutie\n\nFacts is deep, we break up, they hook up with athletes\n\nGet married 'cause we wasn't that match, my G\n\nDon't attach me to the games, I'm lucky, I'm blessed\n\nOne of my exes could be your next, dogâ€”trust me, don't test\n\n\n\nIt's the simple things in life, simple things in life\n\nSimple things in life, simple things in life\n\nIt's the simple things in life, simple things in life\n\nSimple things in life, simple things in life\n\n\n\nRollin' dice, throw no aces\n\nWith my gangsters, we discussin' buyin' acres\n\nOther safe bets, nothin' regular or basic\n\nRidin' back to back, me and Jungle in some spaceships\n\nWhere the squad at? You can see us on the ave\n\nChop it up as always, stand up, Queensbridge\n\nNow the world know us, everybody sayin' my humility's infectious\n\nI just want my kids to have the same peace I'm blessed with"
