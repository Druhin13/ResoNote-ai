  "lyrics": "She said\r\nThis is not about a poltergeist\r\nNot about a phantom that glows at night\r\nBut there are things we don’t know and I\r\nDon’t have another choice but an open mind, oh\r\nAnd I know what they’ll say\n\nI’m trying to make sense of what no one can explain\n\nBut I’ve been having dreams that after I’m awake\n\nPlay out in reality the very next day\n\n\n\nSo I play along\n\nI nod my head when they say I’m wrong\n\nBut each night falls and away I run\n\nOn the other side till the daylight comes\n\nSo I play along\n\nI nod my head when they say I’m wrong\n\nBut each night falls and away I run\n\nOn the other side till the daylight comes\n\n\n\nAnd when the lights go down\n\nI see things I can’t explain\n\nCalling out my name\n\nThe lights go down\n\nHolding every memory close\n\nTonight is for our ghosts\n\nGhosts, ghosts\n\nTonight is for our ghosts\n\n\n\nThis is not about you and me\n\nI can’t bring back how it used to be\n\nAnd I know what I do believe but\n\nI’ve already seen what I couldn’t see, oh\n\n\n\nSo I play along\n\nI nod my head when they say I’m wrong\n\nBut each night falls and away I run\n\nOn the other side till the daylight comes\n\n\n\nAnd when the lights go down\n\nI see things I can’t explain\n\nCalling out my name\n\nThe lights go down\n\nHolding every memory close\n\nTonight is for our ghosts\n\n\n\nAnd when the lights go down\n\nIs there something in the air\n\nThere but never there\n\nThe lights go down\n\nHolding every memory close\n\nTonight is for our ghosts\n\nGhosts, ghosts\n\nTonight is for our ghosts\n\nGhosts, ghosts\n\nTonight is for our ghosts"
