  "lyrics": "Blue in your eyes\r\nAs I fall for the night\r\nBut you'll fade away\r\nWhen morning light is rising\r\nLeave a taste lingering on my skin\n\nHave I been here before?\n\nYou touch me and I fall\n\nI close my eyes, on the horizon me and you\n\nI can see the lights inside my mind are glowing blue\n\n\n\nYou won't stay\n\nSaid I'd keep those thoughts at bay\n\nBut I can't help feeling\n\nThere's nobody like you\n\nHow I've tried, but I can't let you go\n\n\n\nHave I been here before?\n\nYou touch me and I fall\n\nI close my eyes, on the horizon me and you\n\nI can see the lights inside my mind are glowing blue\n\n\n\nHave I been here before?\n\nYou touch me and I fall\n\nI close my eyes, on the horizon me and you\n\nI can see the lights inside my mind are glowing blue\n\n\n\nHave I been here before?\n\nYou touch me and I fall\n\nI close my eyes, on the horizon me and you\n\nI can see the lights inside my mind are glowing blue"
