  "lyrics": "I was a liar\r\nI'll never be holy in your eyes\r\nBut you'll never be either\r\n'Cause I know that underneath your smile\r\nHides the nights that you regret, and the days you can't forget\r\nCause you know me\n\nAnd we'll never be holy\n\n\n\nI've been keeping to myself\n\nAnd looking back over my shoulder\n\nTrying to live my life just like somebody else\n\nAnd forget all the empty words I told ya\n\n\n\nI'm a mess, these demons follow me home\n\nIt's easy to bury the guilt on my own\n\nNow my fears will finally swallow me whole\n\n'Cause I wasn't honest\n\nAnd I never wanted to admit that\n\n\n\nI was a liar\n\nI'll never be holy in your eyes\n\nBut you'll never be either\n\n'Cause I know that underneath your smile\n\nHides the nights that you regret, and the days you can't forget\n\nCause you know me\n\nAnd we'll never be holy\n\n\n\nIt's a sickness I can't seem to shake\n\n'Til I wake up alone and ashamed\n\nOr a tie that I'm too scared to break\n\nIn case I'm drunk and I need you again\n\n\n\nI was never the one\n\nI was always just easy\n\nYou would lend me enough to follow through\n\nMaybe when you're alone\n\nAnd you look in the mirror\n\nWell, you can feel as low as I do\n\n\n\nJust a mess, these demons follow you home\n\nIt's easy to bury the guilt on your own\n\nNow your fears will finally swallow you whole\n\nBut I wasn't honest\n\nAnd you never wanted to admit that\n\n\n\nI was a liar\n\nI'll never be holy in your eyes\n\nBut you'll never be either\n\n'Cause I know that underneath your smile\n\nHides the nights that you regret, and the days you can't forget\n\nCause you know me\n\nAnd we'll never be holy\n\n\n\nAnd we'll never be holy (holy in your eyes)\n\nNo, we'll never be holy (holy in your eyes)\n\n\n\n'Cause the nights that you regret, and the days you can't forget\n\nLeave you lonely\n\nAnd we'll never be holy\n\n\n\nI'll always be a mess if I keep living this way\n\nDespite all my flaws, I still hope you're okay\n\nI don't know if I can honestly say\n\nThat it's getting better\n\nBut at least together\n\nWe were holy"
