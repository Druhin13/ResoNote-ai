  "lyrics": "Driving down Sunset, hair rolling back and over my arms\r\nHeart racing so fast, driver on the gas, youâ€™re by my side\r\nAnd I love you, and I love you, I do, oh\r\nWhat if I can never be there?\r\nWhat If I would always hide?\n\nWhat if you were temporary?\n\nLooking through my mind\n\n\n\nThis is my life\n\nThis is my life\n\nThis is my life\n\nTo the day I die\n\n\n\nLiving on the edge of a dream\n\nLiving on the other side of the screen\n\nLiving on the edge of a dream\n\nLiving on the other side of the screen\n\nBaby till the day I --\n\n\n\nI'm flying\n\nTwo drinks in my lap in the morning light\n\nTouching down, another place on the map, you're by my side\n\nAnd I love you, and I love you, I do, oh\n\n\n\nWhat if I can never be there?\n\nWhat If I would always hide?\n\nWhat if you were temporary?\n\nLooking through my mind\n\n\n\nThis is my life\n\nThis is my life\n\nThis is my life\n\nTo the day I die\n\n\n\nLiving on the edge of a dream\n\nLiving on the other side of the screen\n\nLiving on the edge of a dream\n\nLiving on the other side of the screen\n\nBaby till the day I die"
