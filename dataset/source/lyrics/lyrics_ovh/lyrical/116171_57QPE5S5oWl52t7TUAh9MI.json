  "lyrics": "If you just grew up a little more\r\nThen you know that you'd be perfect, you'd be perfect\r\nIf you just tried harder like I know you could\r\nThen you know that it'd be worth it, it'd be worth it\n\nI could tell myself that you'll get there, you'll get there\n\nBut the more that you don't, the less blind I am\n\nI could tell myself that you'll get there, hang in there\n\nBut honestly now, I'm beginning to understand\n\n\n\nThat I'm not in love with you\n\nI'm not in love with you\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\n\n\nI get fed up and then you show up\n\nYou act like I'm so perfect, I'm so perfect\n\nA shot of stronger keeps me longer\n\nAnd I hope that, I hope it's worth it, I hope it's worth it\n\n\n\nI could tell myself that you'll get there, you'll get there\n\nBut the more that you don't, the less blind I am\n\nI could tell myself that you'll get there, hang in there\n\nYou'll get there\n\n\n\nBut I'm not in love with you\n\nI'm not in love with you\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\n\n\nYeah, you are is who you are\n\nAnd it's alright but it's not right for me\n\nNo\n\nMaybe one day but it's too late\n\nAnd I can't wait but I can't wait to see\n\nNo\n\n\n\nI'm not in love with you\n\n\n\nNo, I'm not in love with you\n\nI'm not in love with you\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\n\n\nI'm not in love with you\n\nI'm not in love with you\n\nI'm in love with your potential\n\nI'm in love with your potential"
