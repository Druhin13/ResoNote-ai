  "lyrics": "I won’t be nervous\r\nWhen everybody around us\r\nSays, \"God we don’t deserve this\"\r\nAnd begs before they accept our fate\r\nI want the world but I’m not\r\nPrepared to work for a change\n\nI think I’d rather be dead\n\n\n\nI’m not anti-social, I’m anti-bullshit\n\nI’m not anti-social, I’m anti-bullshit\n\n\n\nYou’re gonna follow like a freelance sucker of the next biggest trend\n\nWe’re pissing into the wind, to be heard by the indifferent\n\nShit talker, you’ve double crossed your own\n\nYou’re gonna suffer like a rat in the smoke\n\n\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to know\n\n\"We’re only human\" is a valid excuse\n\nFor why my mind's polluted\n\nDo you want the truth or do you want to assume it?\n\n\n\nI’m not anti-social, I’m anti-bullshit\n\nI’m not anti-social, I’m anti-bullshit\n\n\n\nSo raise it up, up, up\n\nIf you’re sick of this fake smile politics\n\nUp, up if you’re sick of this race we’re running\n\nWhat're you living for if you can’t even feel it?\n\nWhat is living without letting go?\n\n\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to know\n\n\"We’re only human\" is a valid excuse\n\nFor why my mind's polluted\n\nDo you want the truth or do you want to assume it?\n\n\n\nServes you right, to justify the face that keeps you up at night\n\nThe mask you wear to cover it up and we can see it in your eyes\n\nServes you right, to justify the face that keeps you up at night\n\nThe mask you wear to cover it up and I can see it in your eyes\n\n\n\nI'm sick of the sound\n\nI'm sick of the hand we’ve been dealt\n\nSick from the drugs that they tell me to take\n\nI'm sick of the drugs that we take to rebel\n\nSick of corruption in wealth\n\nSick of corruption itself\n\nSick of division in colour, religion\n\nWhen we’re all the same\n\n\n\nI’m not anti-social, I’m anti-bullshit\n\nI’m not anti-social, I’m anti-bullshit\n\n\n\nJust leave it alone\n\nMy head's about to explode\n\nSo sick of the same sound syndrome\n\nThank fuck for headphones"
