  "lyrics": "In calculated silence\r\nCaptivated by the violence of the play\r\nFifteen years ago today\r\nOh, an evil evolution\r\nWill bring a feeble institution to it's knees\r\nOh, doctor can't you see?\n\n\n\nThat when the hands of fate\n\nFall on the midnight hour\n\nBehind this mask of hate\n\nI don the devil's power\n\n\n\nThese are the devil's eyes\n\nThe devil's eyes\n\nGo!\n\n\n\nA former portrait of perfection\n\nPainted without plight\n\nNow Haddonfield's my battlefield\n\nYour kids won't make it home tonight\n\nWith a madness void of reason\n\nI kill with every strike\n\nI'll haunt you day after day\n\nKnife after knife\n\nDay after day\n\nKnife after knife\n\nTaking life after life\n\n\n\nWhen the hands of fate\n\nFall on the midnight hour\n\nBehind this mask of hate\n\nI don the devil's power\n\nIf there's life in the shadows\n\nLet the knife leave its mark\n\nWhen the certainty of safety feels like stabbing\n\nStabbing in the dark\n\n\n\nYou'll learn a heartless human harvest\n\nFeeds this festival of flesh\n\nStalking at the top\n\nScream of the crop\n\nA silent cut above the rest\n\nWhere blood's thicker than water\n\nI've carved up quite a scene\n\nWith your worst fears carved on this white veneer\n\nI'll change the face of halloween\n\n\n\nYou can't kill the boogeyman\n\n\n\nWhen the hands of fate\n\nFall on the midnight hour\n\nBehind this mask of hate\n\nI don the devil's power\n\nIf there's life in the shadows\n\nLet the knife leave its mark\n\nWhen the certainty of safety feels like stabbing\n\nStabbing in the dark\n\n\n\nAll units respond. Multiple fatalities reported on Orange Grove Ave. Suspect has been identified as one Michael Myers. He is armed and extremely dangerous. Shoot to kill, I repeat, Shoot to kill over\n\n\n\nI am a shadow where there once was light\n\nStrangling all signs of life\n\nIt's either you or some kid down the street\n\nThe choice is yours\n\nTrick or fuckin' treat!\n\n\n\nMichael!\n\nStop it!\n\nAhhhhhh!\n\n\n\nWhen the hands of fate\n\nFall on the midnight hour\n\nBehind this mask of hate\n\nI don the devil's power\n\nIf there's life in the shadows\n\nLet the knife leave its mark\n\nWhen the certainty of safety feels like stabbing\n\nStabbing in the dark"
