  "lyrics": "O victory in Jesus\r\nMy Savior, forever\r\nHe sought me and bought me\r\nWith His redeeming blood\r\nHave you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\n\nAre you fully trusting in His grace this hour?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb? (Come on!)\n\n\n\nAre you washed (are you washed) in the blood (in the blood)\n\nIn the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?\n\nAre your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?\n\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\n\n\n\nWhat can wash away my sin?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus\n\nWhat can make me whole again?\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus\n\n\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\n\nIn the blood (in the blood) of the Lamb (of the Lamb)\n\nThere is power, power, wonder-working power\n\nIn the precious blood of the Lamb\n\n\n\nOh! precious is the flow\n\nThat makes me white as snow\n\nNo other fount I know\n\nNothing but the blood of Jesus\n\nSo, nothing but the blood of Jesus\n\n\n\nAre you washed in the blood\n\nIn the blood of the Lamb?\n\nHe sought me and bought me\n\nThere's nothing but the blood of Jesus"
