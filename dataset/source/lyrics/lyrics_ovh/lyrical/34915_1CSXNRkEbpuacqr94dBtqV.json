  "lyrics": "I've had a lot of big dreams\r\nI've made a lot of bad moves\r\nI know you could walk away\r\nBut you never do\r\nI've met a lot of cold hearts\n\nI've learned to smile and deceive\n\nI know I'm hard to be around\n\nBut you never leave\n\n\n\nI'm not easy to understand\n\nBut you hold out your hand\n\n\n\nAnd you say you love me\n\nJust as I am\n\nYou always treat me\n\nThe best that you can\n\nYou say you want me, need me\n\nLove me, baby\n\nJust as I am, just as I am\n\n\n\nI've made a lot of heartaches\n\nI've found a lot of closed doors\n\nWhen all the others turn away\n\nYou love me more\n\nYou love me more\n\n\n\nI'm not easy to understand\n\nBut you hold out your hand\n\n\n\nAnd you say you love me\n\nJust as I am\n\nYou always treat me\n\nThe best that you can\n\nYou say you want me, need me\n\nLove me, baby\n\nJust as I am, just as I am\n\n\n\nI want to love forever\n\nTo keep our world together\n\nAnd be the best that I can be\n\nBaby, every time the world caves in on me\n\n\n\nAnd you say you love me\n\nJust as I am\n\nYou always treat me\n\nThe best that you can\n\nYou say you want me, need me\n\nLove me, baby\n\nJust as I am, just as I am"
