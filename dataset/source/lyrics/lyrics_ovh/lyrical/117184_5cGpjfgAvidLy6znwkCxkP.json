  "lyrics": "You cannot break down what can't be broken\r\nOut of all the wrinkles, I was chosen\r\nWhen all of the lights, they get low\r\nAnd all of the curtains they close\r\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken\n\nThey can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable\n\nThey scared to face the truth because they hate the view\n\nThey taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose\n\nShould I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce\n\nIn 1982, my momma take me to a space shuttle\n\nSay now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food\n\nUnless you go and take the neighbors' food\n\nAnd be afraid of who, I made the loot\n\nWhen money went from army green to navy blue\n\nI said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof\n\nSometimes feel like my head a screw\n\nTwisted like tornados too\n\nMan, I'ma need some crazy glue\n\nHer walls is what I'm breaking through\n\nHer nails, she gone break a few\n\nYou can never break me down and I can't hit the brakes for you (errr!)\n\n\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken\n\nOut of all the wrinkles, I was chosen (yeah)\n\nWhen all of the lights, they get low (low)\n\nAnd all of the curtains they close (they close)\n\nYou cannot break down (you can't) what can't be broken\n\n\n\nG-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code\n\nWe bros (can't be broken)\n\nWe bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code\n\n(Can't be broken)\n\n\n\nI ain't finna break or fix the brakes\n\nYou hear me late, I'm laughing in your face\n\nNow, fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil a day\n\nFor like a million days\n\nAt least the bills are paid, the children safe\n\nWant to get away? No, I'm here to stay\n\nI'm really great, but don't discriminate\n\n'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face\n\nYou stickin' out your chest, your titties fake\n\nDon't make me pick your fate\n\nI'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced\n\nThe heart was built to break\n\nI'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake\n\nI got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case\n\nMy killers straight, let's do some Q & A\n\nYou saw the news today\n\nGot news to break and rules to break\n\nIt hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break\n\nIt's worth the wait, commercial break\n\n\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)\n\nOut of all the wrinkles, I was chosen\n\nWhen all of the lights, they get low\n\nAnd all of the curtains they close\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)\n\n\n\nG-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code\n\nWe bros (can't be broken)\n\nWe bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code\n\n(Can't be broken)"
