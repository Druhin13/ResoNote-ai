  "lyrics": "It wasn't nothing but a heartache\r\nIn the middle of a bad dream\r\nLike I took on the whole world\r\nAnd I never had a chance, girl\r\nWas a one-way conversation\r\nI never got the invitation\n\nThe sharpness of her words deceiving\n\nAnd I couldn't stop the bleeding\n\nAnd Lord, I tried to be forgiving\n\nBut getting by don't mean you're living\n\nAnd on that highway going nowhere\n\nWas an exit overdue\n\nAnd all she had to give was heartache\n\nSo she broke my heart in two\n\nYes, she did\n\nYou found me drifting in a small boat\n\nIn the middle of an ocean\n\nYou were there on my horizon\n\nAnd I didn't have a notion\n\nUnprepared to comprehend it\n\nFelt alone and unattended\n\nSaid my prayers and reached my hand out\n\nAnd you appeared to me that day\n\nCame and led me to a new shore\n\nI had never been there before\n\nPut me in the right direction\n\nAnd you led me out of Hell\n\nAnd if it wasn't for your good heart\n\nI'd have never broke her spell\n\n'cause you promised me tomorrow\n\nAnd I learned that lesson well\n\nYes, I did. Yes, I did\n\nYou're the sum of all my heartbeats\n\nYou're the only truth my heart needs\n\nShowed me how to make the journey\n\nI can't let you walk away. No, not today\n\n'cause I've already slept with heartache\n\nTime to chase the night away\n\nJust the two of us together\n\nDoes forever sound okay?\n\nSay \"Yes, it does.\" Say, \"Yes, it does.\" Oh, yes it does.\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Jim Davidson for these lyrics)"
