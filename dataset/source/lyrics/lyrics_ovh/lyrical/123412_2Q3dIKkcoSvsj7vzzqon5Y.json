  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Talkin' Tennessee par Morgan Wallen\r\nYou say those city boys living in those high rise condos\nOnly left you feeling low\nThose little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast\nBut never got you where you wanted to go\nAll I've ever owned is an old C 72\nCuddled up, get you falling in love on the bench seat\n\nDon't mind me I'm just talking Tennessee\nGirl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby\nThat's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me\nThere I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on\nLittle sweet nothing southernisms, jack and seven sipping\n\nHoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee\n\nYou say those street lights only ever let you see the skyline\nIt's been a long time\nSince the Milky Way, Jupiter and Venus took your breath away\nYeah like you're taking mine\nWhat you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars\nCatch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar\n\nDon't mind me I'm just talking Tennessee\nGirl don't blame me if I slip and call you baby\nThat's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me\nThere I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on\n\nLittle sweet nothing southernisms, jack and seven sipping\nHoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee\n\nThere I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on\nLittle sweet nothing southernisms, jack and seven sipping\nHoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee\n\nTalking Tennessee\nTalking Tennessee"
