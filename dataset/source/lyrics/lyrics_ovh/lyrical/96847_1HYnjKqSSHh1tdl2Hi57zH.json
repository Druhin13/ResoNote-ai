  "lyrics": "All the fear and the fire of the end of the world\r\nHappens each time a boy falls in love with a girl\r\nHappens great, happens sweet\r\nHappily, I'm unfazed here, too\r\nWasteland, baby\n\nI'm in love, I'm in love with you\n\n\n\nAll the things yet to come are the things that have passed\n\nLike the old enough hands, like the breaking of glass\n\nLike the bonfire that burns, at all worth in the fight fell too\n\n\n\nWasteland, baby\n\nI'm in love, I'm in love with you\n\nAnd I love too, that love soon might end\n\nBe known in its aching\n\nShown in the shaking\n\nLately of my wasteland, baby\n\nBe still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking\n\nThough quaking, though crazy\n\nThat's just wasteland, baby\n\n\n\nAnd that day that we watch the death of the sun\n\nThat the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on\n\nAnd you gaze unafraid as they sob from the city ruins\n\n\n\nWasteland, baby\n\nI'm in love, I'm in love with you\n\nAnd I love too, that love soon might end\n\nBe known in its aching\n\nShown in the shaking\n\nLately of my wasteland, baby\n\nBe still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking\n\nThough quaking, though crazy\n\nThat's just wasteland, baby\n\n\n\nAnd the stance of the sea and the absence of green\n\nAre the death of all things that I've seen and unseen\n\nNot an end, but the start of all things that are left to do\n\n\n\nWasteland, baby\n\nI'm in love, I'm in love with you\n\n\n\nThat's it"
