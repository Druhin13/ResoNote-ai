  "lyrics": "From time to time I miss, your little body next to mine\r\nI see the shape upon the pillow that you used to make\r\nOh but that was then and that can't come again\r\nI resign myself to time and what's no longer mine\r\nThis won't make sense to you now, I won't bore you with this now\n\nPack your bags and smile, it will only be a little while\n\nI know you have to go, but don't forget, no\n\nI know you have to go\n\n\n\nYou must outgrow it all\n\nThose marks up on the wall\n\nYou must outgrow it all\n\nAnd you should leave it all behind\n\nAnd I should never mind\n\nYou leaving me behind, oh\n\nThis is what it all was for\n\nTo wave you out the door\n\nIt's what my love was for\n\nAnd I know you have to go\n\nBut don't forget no\n\nI know you have to go\n\n\n\nThis won't make sense to you now, I won't bore you with this now\n\nPack your bags and smile, it will only be a little while\n\nIt will only be a little while\n\nIt will only be a little while\n\nIt will only be a little while"
