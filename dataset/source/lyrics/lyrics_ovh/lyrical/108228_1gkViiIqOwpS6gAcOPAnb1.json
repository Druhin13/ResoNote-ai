  "lyrics": "I come before you with my heart in my hand\r\nHoping you can see me through this veil of tears\r\nSomehow I've got to make you understand\r\nAh, don't you know me after all these years?\r\nOh, love, I hate to disappoint you\n\nBut there's something you should know\n\n\n\nThis is not the center of the universe\n\nThat's alright with me\n\nThis is not the center of the universe\n\nBut it's where I wanna be\n\n\n\nI will be with you everywhere you go\n\nIn gentle breezes that caress your skin\n\nAnd you will see me in the silent snow\n\nIn everything that comes around again\n\n\n\nOh, love, I'll always be beside you\n\nWherever you may roam\n\nSomeday, with all the stars to guide you\n\nYou will find your way back home\n\n\n\nThis is not the center of the universe\n\nThat's alright with me\n\nThis is not the center of the universe"
