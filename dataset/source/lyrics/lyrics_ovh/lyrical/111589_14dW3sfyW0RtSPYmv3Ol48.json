  "lyrics": "I'm tearing London limb from limb\r\nIt's tearing me apart, but it's us or them\r\nSo howl at the moon, oh how can it be\r\nThe softer the skin, the sharper the teeth\r\nYeah!\n\nSo call the nurse, 'cause it's worse when I'm alone\n\nI've fallen prey to a curse I can't disown\n\nIs it all in my head?\n\nBlood on the hands of a man so filled with doubt\n\nBut this is love I just can't live without\n\n(Despite the toll of the dead)\n\n\n\nSo howl at the moon, oh how can it be\n\nThe softer the skin the sharper the teeth\n\nWith nowhere to go, nothing to believe\n\nI'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast\n\n\n\nYou bit off more than you could chew\n\nBut you taste too good to be true\n\nSafe in my arms you will lay, cause every dog has its day\n\n(Dog has its day)\n\n\n\nSo howl at the moon, oh how can it be\n\nThe softer the skin the sharper the teeth\n\nWith nowhere to go, nothing to believe\n\nI'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast\n\nSo howl at the moon, oh how can it be (Oh how can it be)\n\nThe softer the skin the sharper the teeth\n\nWith nowhere to go, nothing to believe (nothing to believe)\n\nI'm counting on beauty to kill off the beast\n\nSo just put me down"
