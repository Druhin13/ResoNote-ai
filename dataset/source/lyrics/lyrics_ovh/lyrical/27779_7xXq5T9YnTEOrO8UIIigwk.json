  "lyrics": "Every time I look up across the room all I see\r\nThis place is overcrowded with the lights too bright\r\nFeel like I've waited all night for you\r\nBut I've been shaking these hands all night\r\nAll I wanna do is just talk with you\n\n\n\nAnd brush back your hands head down so far ,far from me\n\nYour friends are all here having a good time\n\nBut I just wanna get lost in you ,for days\n\n\n\nI've been shaking these hands all night\n\nAnd all I wanna do is just talk with you\n\n\n\nBut I've been shaking these hands all night\n\nAnd all I wanna do is just talk with you"
