Are you ready? Yeah\n\n\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me\n\n(Check it out, check it out)\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me\n\n\n\nI'm aware that we just met\n\nI don't wanna leave you yet\n\nPromise that I won't forget\n\nI'm coming back, I'm coming back\n\nYes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh\n\nAbout to board a flight, sitting at my gate\n\nI just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)\n\nAll I wanna do is give you all of me now\n\nAre you ready? Are you ready? Oh\n\n\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me\n\n(Check it out, check it out)\n\nDon't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly"
