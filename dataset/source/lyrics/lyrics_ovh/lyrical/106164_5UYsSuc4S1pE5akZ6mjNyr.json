I still get harassed here\r\nDon't stir up, this gas near, a few of us last here\r\nI'm still on my black hoodie shit, the syndicate\n\nTo chase another million air\n\nWatch you play musical chairs\n\nLike who music compares?\n\nThe Zombies kickin' the snares\n\nThey say it's a dub\n\nYou sold the troub', nigga, what's good?\n\nI'm never intimidated, the Sonics like Gary Paton, the glove\n\nYou my blood, Flatbush raised me and such\n\nAnd bill money, gettin' niggas, they ain't makin' enough\n\nEven though I wasn't rich, I never made it to crunch\n\nI'd rather die a broke man than be rich and pompous\n\nSloppy with your focus, we hang rosaries for your lack of trust\n\nStart ball, shot's too good for you to pass it up\n\nInformers, they zoom in, scope the situation\n\nI just plug my iPhone in to get the litigations\n\n\n\nI don't believe in non-believers\n\nI don't hear or speak evil either\n\nThis the institution of the leaders\n\nConspire retribution for our freedom\n\nWe squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people\n\nI don't believe in non-believers\n\nI don't hear or speak evil neither\n\nThis the institution of the leaders\n\nConspire retribution for our freedom\n\nWe squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people\n\n\n\nWhen it's permanent, it's solely nervousness, dog\n\nThis when you serve your sermon with salt\n\nPetty dog, I told you already how I got my mind made up\n\nSwitchin' foreigns like customs, so when I drive the lay up\n\nPicture me fallin' victim, man, I gotta stay up\n\nNo trickery with my Benjamins, you gotta pay up, say what?\n\nMy identity, lost in the matrix with this trinity\n\nArchitect on the set, we was on the TV screen\n\nGot the check, got the rep, then I changed the scenery\n\nSpent some days in Paris just to peril in my queen and me\n\nButterfly charms, that's a honor what they mean to me\n\nI just wanna see the same things that my idols see\n\nWait to see the god in me, I done told the Odyssey\n\n40 for the thing that be playin' when I'm round it, B\n\nI done post things, I fly planes all account of me\n\nJust another day, gettin' paid when you count on me\n\n\n\nI don't believe in non-believers\n\nI don't hear or speak evil either\n\nThis the institution of the leaders\n\nConspire retribution for our freedom\n\nWe squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people\n\nI don't believe in non-believers\n\nI don't hear or speak evil neither\n\nThis the institution of the leaders\n\nConspire retribution for our freedom\n\nWe squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people\n\nI don't believe in non-believers\n\nI don't hear or speak evil either\n\nThis the institution of the leaders\n\nConspire retribution for our freedom\n\nWe squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people\n\nI don't believe in non-believers\n\nI don't hear or speak evil neither\n\nThis the institution of the leaders\n\nConspire retribution for our freedom\n\nWe squeeze guns, unleashin' holy war on the people"
