  "lyrics": "She likes the boys who can dance\r\nAnd she likes musicians\r\nSigning pictures of a mall, hanging there by the bedroom shelf\r\nShe just wants to be like the girls on the television\r\nThere's no one ever told her, it was okay to love herself\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n\nBeat still, beating heart\n\nCause this is her show\n\nAnd you'll never be a star\n\n\n\nCause she falls in love every night\n\nDon't even know your name\n\nAnd no, it's fine\n\nYou know and then we cross by her eyes\n\nIt's not her fault that she wants\n\nThat she wants it\n\nShe falls in love every night\n\nAnd she don't even know what devils like\n\nShe been dancing in the dark throughout her life\n\nIt's not her fault that she wants\n\nThat she wants it\n\n\n\nShe sings a faded song, doesn't makeup in the bathroom\n\nShe dances in the mirror, there's dresses out on the bed\n\nShe leave a lipstick, con you like a tattoo\n\nSo when you try to wash it off\n\nYou'll remember that you can't forget\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh\n\nBeat still, beating heart\n\nCause this is her show\n\nThat you'll never be a star\n\n\n\nCause she falls in love every night\n\nDon't even know your name\n\nAnd no, it's fine\n\nYou know and then we cross by her eyes\n\nIt's not her fault that she wants\n\nThat she wants it\n\nShe falls in love every night\n\nAnd she don't even know what devils like\n\nShe been dancing in the dark throughout her life\n\nIt's not her fault that she wants\n\nThat she wants it\n\nIt's not her fault that she wants\n\nThat she wants it\n\n\n\nIt's not her fault that she wants\n\nThat she wants"
