  "lyrics": "I'm looking for a way out\r\nfor a place no one knows\r\nplease take me away now\r\nsomewhere that don't feel so cold\r\ntroubles on my mind\n\nfor restful days i've cried\n\ni'm searching for a paraside \n\nthat i just can't seem to find\n\ni'm searching for a paradise\n\nfor the time of my life\n\ni'm searching for a paradise\n\nthat i just can't seem to find\n\ni'm searching for a paradise\n\ngonna go where the spirit guides, all alone.\n\n\n\nmy silhouette is fading\n\npast the point of safe return\n\nnow my body's aching \n\nas both ends of the candles burn\n\n\n\nmy heart is beating slow\n\nit's warming to the bone\n\ni'm searching for a paraside \n\nthat i just can't seem to find\n\ni'm searching for a paradise\n\nfor the time of my life\n\ni'm searchign for a paradise\n\nthat i just can't seem to find\n\ni'm searching for a paradise\n\ngonna go where the spirit guides, \n\nall alone,\n\nall alone,\n\nall alone,\n\nall alone.\n\n\n\ni'm searching for a paraside \n\nthat i just can't seem to find\n\ni'm searching for a paradise\n\nfor the time of my life\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Luke Smith for these lyrics)"
