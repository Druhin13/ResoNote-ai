  "lyrics": "You know I find it hard to sleep when\r\nI'm sleeping by myself\r\nAnd I’m lying in the spare room\r\nThinking I should be somewhere else\r\nYou should know when we've been drinking\r\nWe can sabotage ourselves\n\nLike smashing up the kitchen\n\nNo, there's nothing that seems to help\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t want to wake you up\n\nTell you that I'm leaving town\n\nI already packed my stuff\n\nCan't go back now\n\nBut the way you look brings me straight back down\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n\n\nYou're breaking out the windows\n\nWhile I was tearing down the doors\n\nAnd now I'm picking up the ashtray\n\nThat you threw against the wall\n\n’Cause we take, and we take just a little more\n\nI have no idea what we’re fighting for\n\nNo we're standing right here outside your door\n\nNow I know, now I know\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t want to wake you up\n\nTell you that I'm leaving town\n\nI already packed my stuff\n\nCan't go back now\n\nBut the way you look brings me straight back down\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don’t want to wake you up right now\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n\n\n'Cause I called it with you, I called it without you\n\nYou feel like home, you feel like home\n\n'Cause I called it with you, I called it without you\n\nYou feel like home, you feel like home\n\n\n\nAnd I don't want to wake you up\n\nTell you that I'm leaving town\n\nI already packed my stuff\n\nCan't go back now\n\nBut the way you look brings me straight back down\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n(Called it with you, I called it without you)\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now\n\n(Called it with you, I called it without you)\n\nI was ready to go, ready to go\n\nI don't want to wake you up right now"
