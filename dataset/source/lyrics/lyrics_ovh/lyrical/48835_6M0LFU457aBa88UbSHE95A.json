  "lyrics": "Lost the air in our lungs to a smoke filled room\r\nNow hotel lobbies and these songs remind me of you make your dark bleed black\r\nWhile you’re gripping at my waistline\r\nAct like we don’t know while we whitewash the last time\r\nYou crack like ice but you’re never cold you stole my sight now I’m seeing gold never getting old\r\nTwisting my lips when it hits\n\nIs it as good as it gets?\n\n\n\nOh I’m tripping on the badtimes with you\n\n\n\nI like the way you let me hold you down\n\nWords stuck inside my head they feel like hell oh you still don’t know me but I can’t lonely stuck in the palm of your hand\n\n\n\nOh I’m tripping on the badtimes with you"
