  "lyrics": "Naked in midwinter magic\r\nLies an angel in the snow\r\n- The frozen figure crossed by tracks of wolves\r\nAn encounter, symbolic, yet truthful\r\nWith a hungry choir of woods\r\nAn agreement immemorial to be born\n\n\n\nDulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest\n\nAccompany all charming tunes\n\nof a sacrament by a campfire\n\nA promise between the tameless\n\nand the one with a tool\n\nTonight the journey from cave begins\n\n\n\nI want to hunt with the tameless heart\n\nI want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar\n\nWe will honor the angel in the snow\n\nWe will make the streams for our children flow\n\n\n\nWrapped in furs beneath the northern lights\n\nFrom my cave I watch the land untamed\n\nAnd wonder if some becoming season\n\nwill make the angel melt in shame\n\n\n\nI want to hunt with the tameless heart\n\nI want to learn the wisdom of mountains afar\n\n\n\n[Repeat chorus]"
