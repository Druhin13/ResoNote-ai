  "lyrics": "The coolness of the riverbank, and the whispering of the reeds\r\nDaybreak is not so very far away\r\nEnchanted and spellbound, in the silence they lingered\r\nAnd rowed the boat as the light grew steadily strong\r\nAnd the birds were silent, as they listened for the heavenly music\n\nAnd the river played the song\n\n\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\n\n\nThe song dream happened and the cloven hoofed piper\n\nPlayed in that holy ground where they felt the awe and wonder\n\nAnd they all were unafraid of the great god Pan\n\n\n\nAnd the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\n\n\nWhen the vision vanished they heard a choir of birds singing\n\nIn the heavenly silence between the trance and the reeds\n\nAnd they stood upon the lawn and listened to the silence\n\n\n\nOf the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\n\n\nIt's the wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn\n\nThe wind in the willows and the piper at the gates of dawn"
