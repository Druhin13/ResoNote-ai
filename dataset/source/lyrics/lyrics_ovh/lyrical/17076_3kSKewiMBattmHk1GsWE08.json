  "lyrics": "You thought it’d be\r\nAn easy trip\r\nBut I took you for a ride\r\nWoah, the devil’s on your side\r\nYou first refused\n\nTo take me in\n\nBut I made you open wide\n\nWoah, the devil’s on your side\n\n\n\nI’m in the back of your mind\n\nI’m in the front of your head\n\nI’m in the meaning behind\n\nI’m in the gold and the lead\n\nI’m there when you’re whirling the wheel\n\nI’m there when you’re facing the fire\n\nI’m there when you’re doing the deal\n\nI’m there in the lower and higher\n\n\n\nThe slime of life\n\nHad stained your heart\n\nBut I kept you purified\n\nWoah, the devil’s on your side\n\n\n\nThe kings of earth\n\nTried to lend a hand\n\nI made sure their hands were tied\n\nWoah, the devil’s on your side\n\n\n\nI’m at the top of the stairs\n\nI’m at the foot of the cross\n\nI’m at the death of your cares\n\nI’m at the moment of loss\n\nI’m there when you’re breaking the bone\n\nI’m there when you’re daring to dream\n\nI’m there when you go it alone\n\nI’m there when you’re part of the team\n\n\n\nWhen all your thoughts\n\nBecome as one\n\nI’ll reveal a new divide\n\nWoah, the devil’s on your side\n\n\n\nYou can try your best\n\nTo block me out\n\nBut I just won’t be denied\n\nWoah, the devil’s on your side\n\n(Woah...)\n\n\n\nNo matter where you try to go\n\nYou can never hide\n\nThe devil is inside"
