  "lyrics": "Avoiding this disaster\r\nSeemed impossible\r\nMy heart is beating faster\r\nFast as it can go\r\n'Cause I'm overthinking every word\r\nThat was never said or heard\n\nHappy ever after?\n\nI don't think so\n\n\n\nI'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist\n\nI stare from afar in my hand-broken heart while I play pretend\n\nI'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist\n\nAnd it's you, yes, it's true, you don't even know it, I can't ever win\n\n\n\nAm I invisible?\n\nShould I let it go? Would you ever know?\n\nAm I just another crazy laying on the low?\n\nAm I invisible?\n\nWill you ever see what you do to me?\n\nBreaking hearts in the dark so easily\n\nAm I invisible?\n\n\n\nTangled up and tongue-tied\n\nWhat have I become?\n\nAlways got you on my mind\n\nGot me feeling dumb\n\nAnd I'm tripping over my own feet\n\nAnd I'm mad you got the best of me\n\nFalling for you slowly\n\nFrom a distance\n\n\n\nI'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist\n\nI stare from afar in my hand-broken heart while I play pretend\n\nI'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist\n\nAnd it's you, yes, it's true, you don't even know it, I can't ever win\n\n\n\nAm I invisible?\n\nShould I let it go? Would you ever know?\n\nAm I just another crazy laying on the low?\n\nAm I invisible?\n\nWill you ever see what you do to me?\n\nBreaking hearts in the dark so easily\n\nAm I invisible?\n\n\n\n(Am I invisible?)\n\n(Am I invisible?)\n\nI'm in love with someone who doesn't know I exist\n\nAnd it's you, yes, it's true, you don't even know it, I can't ever win\n\n\n\nAm I invisible?\n\nShould I let it go? Would you ever know?\n\nAm I just another crazy laying on the low?\n\nAm I invisible?\n\nWill you ever see what you do to me?\n\nBreaking hearts in the dark so easily\n\nAm I invisible?"
