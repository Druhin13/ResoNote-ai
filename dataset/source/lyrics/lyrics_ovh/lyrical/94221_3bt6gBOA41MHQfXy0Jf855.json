  "lyrics": "I wanna watch you, I wanna stay like this\r\nI wanna feel it all every time that we kiss\r\nI want your mother to stay friends with mine\r\nI want this feeling to pass in time\r\nBut you know my body now and I know yours\r\nWe put so many things between these walls\n\nAnd every gift you buy me, I know what's inside\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nThere’s nothing left to find\n\n\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon’t know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\n\n\nWhat if I cleaned up?\n\nWhat if I worked on my skin?\n\nI could scrub until I am red, hot, weak and thin\n\nToo tired to run away\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nThere's nothing left to say\n\n\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\n\n\nInto the darkness, or is it the light?\n\nShould I be waking up\n\nOr finding a place to sleep tonight?\n\nWho will I be\n\nNow that you're no longer next to me?\n\n\n\nDon’t know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon’t know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon’t know how to keep loving you\n\n\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nDon't know how to keep loving you\n\nNow that I know you so well\n\nI just wanna keep loving you"
