  "lyrics": "Can't help seeking corners\r\nOf dark and dead end rooms\r\nWhere the drinks keep pouring down\r\nAnd the candles keep me warm\r\nIsolation tenders\n\nSomething fragile coming soon\n\nSkinny angels making eyes at cameras\n\nPerched in every room\n\n\n\nI had a good run playing horses in my mind\n\nLeft my heart out somewhere running\n\nWanting strangers to be mine\n\nMemory's a sacred meat\n\nThat's drying all the time\n\nOn a hillside I remember\n\nI am loving losing life\n\n\n\nStrawberries in springtime\n\nPretty happy accidents\n\nMy awareness that I'm lucky\n\nRolling clouds over cement\n\n\n\nMaybe there's a screenplay\n\nOr a bathroom I can hide\n\nDown the hallways of a high school\n\nAnd the dances left behind\n\n\n\nI had a good run playing horses in my mind\n\nLeft my heart out somewhere running\n\nWanting strangers to be mine\n\nI would climb the Eiffel Tower\n\nWrite letters on the sky\n\nHow many turns it took to reach you\n\n\n\nI had a good run playing horses in my mind\n\nOn a hillside I remember\n\nI am loving losing life"
