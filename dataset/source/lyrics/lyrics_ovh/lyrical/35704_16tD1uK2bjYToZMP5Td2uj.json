  "lyrics": "You were the man who hung the moon\r\nBoy you had me fooled\r\nSpun me 'round, kept me down\r\nAnd safely under you\r\nTook all I had to give and more\r\nLeft me on the floor\n\nCouldn't find a way to crawl out of the\n\nDays turn into nights\n\nDarkness to light\n\nSeasons keep changing\n\nTime, time is my friend after all\n\n\n\nI don't remember the day that I let you go\n\nI don't remember the moment but oh I know\n\nOh I know that I'm finally\n\n\n\nFree like a distant memory\n\nFaintly calling me\n\nWho I am, who I was\n\nAre not the same when I look\n\nAt the picture of my life\n\nI can barely find\n\nWhere we were, where you are\n\nNo longer part of my\n\nDays come to an end\n\nBroken hearts mend\n\nClouds start to part\n\nTime, time is my friend after all\n\n\n\nI don't remember the day when I let you go\n\nI don't remember the moment but oh I know\n\nOh I know that I'm finally\n\n\n\nFree\n\nFrom the burden and the shame\n\nFrom the weight of all of the pain\n\nFree I've taken back, back my heart\n\nAgain\n\n\n\nI don't remember the day when I let you go\n\nI don't remember the moment but oh I know\n\nI don't remember the day when I let you go\n\nI don't remember the moment but oh I know\n\nOh I know that I'm finally\n\nFree"
