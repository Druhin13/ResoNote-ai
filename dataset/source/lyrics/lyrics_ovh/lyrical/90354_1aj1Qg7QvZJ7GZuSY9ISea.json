  "lyrics": "Sick all day and it's 'cause I'm on my lone shit\r\nIn my brain, it be feeling like a mosh pit\r\nYou don't like me 'cause I'm sitting in the cockpit\r\nBeen too long so I told that bitch to stop it\r\nSince I changed, I don't fuck with any sunny days\r\nDon't go out in sunny days without my Cartiers\n\nCartiers nice but I like my Louis frames\n\nFucked that thottie and her friend but I forgot they names\n\nJokes aside, I've been going through some dark shit\n\nEveryday, I just be feeling like some dog shit\n\nIt's like my body just belongs inside a dark trench\n\nThen they find my body laying on a park bench\n\nAll these kids say I'm iconic, you so underrated\n\nWell I rather underrated versus overrated\n\nThey say \"Lovell, all this shit you say be helping me\"\n\nI'm just tryna make you niggas really start to see (Shit)\n\n\n\nTryna make you niggas really start to see, damn, damn\n\n\n\nBreak you down\n\nThen I reach inside your head, just to see your thoughts\n\nYou can't touch me I'm a motherfucking greater demon\n\nYes, I'm back, bitch, this the motherfucking season\n\nWill I pay these niggas mind? There's no fucking reason\n\nWill I pay these bitches mind? They think I don't read 'em\n\nThinking back to when I used to have no fucking stress\n\nAll this shit has turned into a motherfucking mess\n\nNothing fucking less, pain inside my chest\n\nSay you wanna take my pain, be my fucking guest\n\nI'm so done with all these people lying to my face\n\nFeel like moving all my shit some place, so far away\n\nMaybe someday, I'm so fucking done\n\nDon't you try to make me happy, saying I'm the one\n\nYou don't like me, just be honest, this no fucking fun\n\nI refuse to listen to you, there's the fucking sun\n\nIt's time I fucking run, yeah\n\n\n\nWake up\n\nLovell, wake up!"
