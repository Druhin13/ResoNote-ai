  "lyrics": "Heart pounds\r\nMapping every failed attempt\r\nTo leave town\r\nForgetting all the ways we know how.....\n\nI noticed you put down your pen\n\nA little death came\n\nInstantly\n\n\n\nRegain control, focus, compose\n\nOpen my mouth and let it all fall out\n\n\n\nGo out and give them the the best of you, your everything. I know it's hard to dream, and you're losing sleep\n\nAlways remember too, focus ahead of you\n\nKeep safe your spark\n\nIt's what I'm attracted too, your purpose. The fact that you're burning blue versus the orange I'm accustomed to makes it worth it. You know It's true believe Keep safe your Spark\n\n\n\nLife paused\n\nSaw the world as runaways\n\nThrough borrowed cars\n\nGetting lost avoiding cops\n\n\n\nI know that you're a-partial to, my eyes on you from across the room\n\n\n\nMy greens they melt into your blues\n\nI see the world from a different view"
