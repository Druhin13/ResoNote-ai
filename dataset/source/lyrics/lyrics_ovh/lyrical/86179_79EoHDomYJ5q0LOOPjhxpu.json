(yeah)\n\n-\n\nForget the importance\n\nOf what I mean to you\n\nI'll drown all the rodents\n\nAnd chase after you\n\nWell I've made my mistakes and know it\n\nAnd I need a chance to blow it\n\n-\n\n(chorus)\n\nOh oh my!\n\nWho's stolen my right? (yeah)\n\n-\n\nAm I gettin' greedy..\n\n..for what's already mine?\n\nI need all the rations\n\nI don't stand in line\n\nAnd I'll scale the wall\n\nOnly if you feed the rope\n\nBut I'll slip and fall\n\n\n\n-\n\n(chorus)\n\nOh oh my!\n\nWho'll ever believe and why?\n\n-\n\nOh oh my!\n\nI'm the last in line..\n\n-\n\nYou say I'm obsessive..\n\nI don't want to hear\n\nOverly posessive.."
