  "lyrics": "At first, I was afraid, I was petrified\r\nKept thinkin' I could never live\r\nWithout you by my side\r\nBut then I spent so many nights\r\nThinkin' how you did me wrong\r\nAnd I grew strong\n\nAnd I learned how to get along\n\n\n\nAnd so you're back from outer space\n\nI just walked in to find you here\n\nWith that sad look upon your face\n\nI should've changed that stupid lock\n\nI should've made you leave your key\n\nIf I had known, for just one second\n\nYou'd be back to bother me\n\n\n\nWell, now go! Walk out the door!\n\nJust turn around now\n\n'Cause you're not welcome anymore!\n\nWeren't you the one\n\nWho tried to hurt me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\n\n\nOh no, not I! I will survive!\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love\n\nI know I'll stay alive!\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nI've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive! I will survive!\n\nHey, hey!\n\n\n\nIt took all the strength I had\n\nNot to fall apart\n\nAnd trying hard to mend the pieces\n\nOf my broken heart\n\n\n\nAnd I spent, oh, so many nights\n\nJust feeling sorry for myself\n\nI used to cry\n\nBut now I hold my head up high!\n\n\n\nAnd you'll see me, somebody new\n\nI'm not that chained up little person\n\nStill in love with you\n\n\n\nAnd so you felt like droppin' in\n\nAnd just expect me to be free\n\nBut now I'm savin' all my lovin'\n\nFor someone who's lovin' me!\n\n\n\nGo now! Go! Walk out the door!\n\nJust turn around now!\n\n'Cause you're not welcome anymore!\n\nWeren't you the one\n\nWho tried to break me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\n\n\nOh no, not I! I will survive!\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love\n\nI know I'll stay alive!\n\nI've got all my life to live\n\nI've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive. I will survive! Oohh..\n\n\n\nGo now! Go! Walk out the door!\n\nJust turn around now!\n\n'Cause you're not welcome anymore!\n\nWeren't you the one\n\nWho tried to break me with goodbye?\n\nDid you think I'd crumble?\n\nDid you think I'd lay down and die?\n\n\n\nOh no, not I! I will survive!\n\nOh, as long as I know how to love\n\nI know I'll stay alive!\n\nAnd I've got all my life to live\n\nAnd I've got all my love to give\n\nAnd I'll survive. I will survive! I will survive!"
