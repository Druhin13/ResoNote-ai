  "lyrics": "Why\r\nDo we subscribe\r\nTo a universal thread\r\nThat weaves the fabric of our lives\r\nAsk why\r\nWithout batting an eye\n\nWe're so accepting\n\nQuestion everything\n\nQuestion everything you know\n\n\n\nFracture of doubt\n\nCrack to a chasm in an instant\n\nSwallowing whole\n\nThe broken bones of our broken home\n\nInto an ocean of disorder\n\nBut my view through the water's crystal clear\n\nAnd I've got something that you need to hear\n\n\n\nWe don't know who we are, we wander never knowing\n\nFeudal stone walls stop these oceans overflowing\n\n\n\nVirtuosos wrote your thoughts in a symphony\n\nParadigms, transcribed\n\nUnder the supervision of conductors\n\nTo our dissonant chorus\n\nWe orchestrate their composition\n\nThey call it order\n\n\n\nWe don't know who we are, we reap what we are sewing\n\nFabric of our lives catches our eyes we abide unknowing\n\n\n\nWander\n\nQuestion\n\nFind your\n\nObsession\n\nKnowledge\n\nBeckons\n\nFind your\n\nObsession\n\n\n\nWe don't know who we are, we wander never knowing\n\nWe don't know who we are or why we are following\n\nThis script of reality\n\nWhere we become the casualty\n\nConditioned in\n\nAn intellectual prison\n\nFuck this system\n\n\n\nFollow your intuition\n\n\n\nWander\n\nQuestion\n\nFind your\n\nObsession\n\nKnowledge\n\nBeckons\n\nFind your\n\nObsession\n\n\n\nQuestion everything you know"
