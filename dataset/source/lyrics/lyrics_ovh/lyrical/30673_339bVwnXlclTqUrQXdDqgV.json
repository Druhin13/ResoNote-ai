  "lyrics": "I know you said you had a fragile heart\r\nI never meant to break it all apart\r\nBut I'm the bull in your china shop\r\nI trip and fall and find it hard to stop\r\nIt's a delicate dance\n\nWe were taking a chance\n\nI've always had two left feet in love\n\nBut I went and screwed it up\n\n\n\nI never meant to make you fall apart\n\nBut when I fall in love I get clumsy\n\nClumsy with my heart\n\nI messed it up from the moment that we start\n\nDon't want to lose your love I'm just clumsy\n\nClumsy with my heart\n\nI'm just clumsy clumsy clumsy\n\nI'm clumsy with my heart\n\n\n\nI know my edges are a little rough\n\nAnd for what it's worth I'm beating myself up\n\nI should have known should have taken care\n\nNow to watch you break is more than I can bear\n\nLike a porcelain doll in a slow motion fall\n\nYou should probably turn and walk away\n\nBut I'm asking you to stay\n\n\n\nI never meant to make you fall apart\n\nBut when I fall in love I get clumsy\n\nI'm clumsy with my heart\n\nI messed it up from the moment that we start\n\nDon't want to lose your love I'm just clumsy\n\nClumsy with my heart\n\nI'm just clumsy clumsy clumsy\n\nI'm clumsy with my heart\n\n\n\nAnd all that I can offer you\n\nIs just to love you better\n\nBaby I could change forever\n\nDon't walk out that door\n\nI'm falling on my knees for you\n\nTo help you pick the broken pieces from the floor\n\n\n\nI'm just clumsy\n\nI never meant to make you fall apart\n\nBut when I fall in love I get clumsy\n\nClumsy with my heart\n\nI messed it up from the moment that we start\n\nDon't want to lose your love I'm just clumsy\n\nClumsy with my heart\n\nI'm just clumsy clumsy clumsy\n\nI'm just clumsy clumsy clumsy\n\nI'm clumsy with my heart"
