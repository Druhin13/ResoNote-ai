  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Never Wanna Know par MØ (Karen Marie Ørsted)\r\nAll our dreams sleep tonight\nThey'll be safe as we fight\nIn the journey of the best\nAnd I know I've caused you a lot of blues\nNow the last one's playing for you\nBut I couldn't go without letting you know this\n\nI guess our love somehow\nWas too crazy to work out\nI'm crazy about you, but I can't, it just can't do\nAnd we wait until the morning\nThen our lives are moving on\nWith no words, you'll do fine\n\nBut I never wanna know the name\n\nOf your new girlfriend\nNever wanna hear about it\nKeep her stains away\n\nI never wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\n\nI dry my eyes on the highway\nAnd think about why I couldn't stay\nAnd why I should have, cause I love you\nBut the wind blows again\nAnd the life moves on, my friend\nWith some words we wrote down\n\nBut I never wanna know the name\nOf your new girlfriend\n\nNever wanna hear about it\nKeep her stains away\n\nI never wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\n\nHey, all of a sudden I was brain dead and rattled\nWith the thoughts of you and I, and I wanted to goodbye you\nBut the nights are so cold, how I need your human soul\nI would never let you go, if I'd been a little older\n\nNo, no, no, I never wanna know, no, no\nI never wanna hear about her\n\nKeep her stains away\n\nI never wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\nNever wanna know\n\nBut I never wanna know know the name\nOf your new girlfriend\nNever wanna hear about it\nKeep her stains away"
