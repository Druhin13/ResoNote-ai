  "lyrics": "I don't know if you're alone now\r\nOr if you found someone that you can spend the night with\r\nMaybe I should go and find someone too\r\nWould you pick up the phone right now\r\nOr do you still fall asleep with it on silent\r\nThe way that you used to do\n\n\n\nWhen we were one foot in and one foot out\n\nI know that I let you go but I miss you now\n\nAll the things I should've said but I didn't know how\n\nI know that I let you go but I miss you now\n\n\n\nAnd I'm losing my grip, losing my mind\n\nFirst to admit that you could be mine\n\nIt's so unlike me to do\n\nBut I'm losing it all for you\n\nI'd go back, back to the night\n\nAsked for the truth and I told you a lie\n\nSo scared of what I would do\n\nNow I'm losing it all for you\n\n\n\n(Don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\nNow I'm losing it all for you\n\n(I don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\nNow I'm losing it all for you\n\n\n\nMaybe this is bad timing\n\nAnd you probably think that I'm selfish for trying\n\nTo pick up emotions that we buried ages ago\n\nI thought you'd always come and find me\n\nSome type of way to convince me I should come back to you\n\nAnd I would, I would\n\n\n\nOne foot in and one foot out\n\nI know that I let you go but I miss you now\n\nAll the things I should've said but I didn't know how\n\nI know that I let you go but I miss you now\n\n\n\nAnd I'm losing my grip, losing my mind\n\nFirst to admit that you could be mine\n\nIt's so unlike me to do\n\nBut I'm losing it all for you\n\nI'd go back, back to the night\n\nAsked for the truth and I told you a lie\n\nSo scared of what I would do\n\nNow I'm losing it all for you\n\n\n\n(Don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\nNow I'm losing it all for you\n\n(I don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you)\n\n(I don't wanna lose you, I don't, I don't)\n\n(Now I'm losing it all for you)\n\n\n\nAnd I'm losing my grip, losing my mind\n\nFirst to admit that you could be mine\n\nIt's so unlike me to do\n\nBut I'm losing it all for you\n\nI'd go back, back to the night\n\nAsked for the truth and I told you a lie\n\nSo scared of what I would do\n\nNow I'm losing it all for you"
