  "lyrics": "Clocks and spoons and empty rooms\r\nIt's raining out tonight\r\nWhat a way to end a day\r\nBy turnin' out the light\r\nShoot the moon right between the eyes\r\nI'm sending most of me to sunny country side\n\n\n\nRunnin' through sky of blue rollin' in the sun\n\nEvery day has a way of overflowing one\n\nShoot the moon right between the eyes\n\nI'm keeping most of me in sunny country side\n\n\n\nDon't know how I did that now wonder where it's gone\n\nMust have spent the way I went waitin' for the dawn\n\nShoot the moon right between the eyes\n\nI'm screaming\n\nTake me back to sunny country side"
