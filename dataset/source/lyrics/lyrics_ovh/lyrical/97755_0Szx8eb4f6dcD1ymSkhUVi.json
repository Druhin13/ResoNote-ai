  "lyrics": "The day you called, the sun was big and low, to the ground\r\nThe cold, it froze my fingers tight\r\nTime was still and I was lost from sight for a while\r\nThe callers knew to turn me loose\r\nYou had my heart, I knew it from the start\n\nYou had my heart, be it cold inside\n\nAnd every picture made, and every song that played\n\nWas tattooed on my skin forever\n\n\n\nYou ain't ever gonna feel love\n\nYou won't ever feel the way this hurts\n\n'Cause all the memories that we dreamed of now\n\nHave all been washed away\n\nDo you (Feel love, feel love)\n\nDo you ever want to feel love? (Feel love, feel love)\n\nDo you ever feel the way this hurts? (Feel love, feel love)\n\n'Cause all the memories that we dreamed of now (Feel love, feel love)\n\nHave all been washed away, oh oh\n\n\n\nYou ain’t ever gonna feel love\n\nYou won’t ever feel the way this hurts\n\n\n\nThe day you called, the sun was big and low, to the ground\n\nThe cold, it froze my fingers tight\n\nTime was still and I was lost from sight for a while\n\nThe callers knew to turn me loose\n\nI was tired of going back to you, oh so tired\n\nYou played the love that let me down\n\nNow it's me that walks alone on shiny ice that breaks to the core\n\nThis heart has shattered to the ground\n\n\n\nYou had my soul, I felt it taking hold\n\nYou had my soul, God only knows\n\nThat every picture made, and every song that played\n\nWas tattooed on my skin forever\n\n\n\nYou ain't ever gonna feel love\n\nYou won't ever feel the way this hurts\n\n'Cause all the memories that we dreamed of now\n\nHave all been washed away\n\nDo you (Feel love, feel love)\n\nDo you ever want to feel love? (Feel love, feel love)\n\nDo you ever feel the way this hurts? (Feel love, feel love)\n\n'Cause all the memories that we dreamed of now (Feel love, feel love)\n\nHave all been washed away, oh oh (Ooh)\n\n\n\nYou ain’t ever gonna feel love\n\nYou won’t ever feel the way this hurts\n\nYou ain’t ever gonna feel love\n\nYou won’t ever feel the way this hurts\n\n\n\nYou ain’t ever gonna feel love\n\nYou won’t ever feel the way this hurts"
