  "lyrics": "Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens\r\nBright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens\r\nBrown paper packages tied up with strings\r\nThese are a few of my favorite things\r\n\nCream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels\n\nDoorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles\n\nWild geese that fly with the moon on their wings\n\nThese are a few of my favorite things\n\n\n\nGirls in white dresses with blue satin sashes\n\nSnowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes\n\nSilver white winters that melt into springs\n\nThese are a few of my favorite things\n\n\n\nWhen the dog bites, when the bee stings\n\nWhen I'm feeling sad\n\nI simply remember my favorite things\n\nAnd then I don't feel so bad"
