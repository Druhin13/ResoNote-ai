  "lyrics": "Run, whirlwind run, further and further away, into the sun\r\nIn, 20 minutes, everyone will remember you when you're gone\r\nAnd your heart, is a stone, buried underneath your pretty clothes\r\nDon't you know people write songs about girls like you? Like you\r\nWhat will you do when something stops you?\n\nWhat will you say to the world?\n\nWhat will you be when it all comes crashing\n\nDown on you little girl?\n\n\n\nWhat would you do if you lost your beauty?\n\nHow would you deal with the light?\n\nHow would you feel if nobody chased you?\n\nWhat if it happened tonight?\n\n\n\nHow would you cope it the world decided to\n\nMake you suffer for all that you were?\n\nHow could you dance if no-one was watching\n\nAnd you couldn't even care if they were?\n\n\n\nWhat would you do if you couldn't even feel?\n\nNot even pitiful pain\n\nHow would you deal with the empty decisions\n\nEating away at the days?\n\n\n\nDon't you know people write songs about girls like you?\n\nGirls like you, girls like you\n\nDon't you know people write songs about girls like you?\n\nGirls like you, girls like you\n\n\n\nEverything you say is fire\n\nAll the claims you make, you liar\n\nEverything you say is fire\n\nSee it in the grey you crier\n\nDon't you know people write songs about girls like you?\n\nGirls like you, girls like you\n\nDon't you know people write songs about girls like you?\n\n(Everything you say is fire)\n\nGirls like you, girls like you\n\n(All the claims you make, you liar)\n\nDon't you know people write songs about girls like you?\n\n(Everything you say is fire)\n\nGirls like you, girls like you\n\n(See it in the grey you crier)"
