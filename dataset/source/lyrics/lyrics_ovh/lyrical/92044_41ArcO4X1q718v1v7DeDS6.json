  "lyrics": "Well, it's pretty much understood\r\nRainy days are just no good for leaving\r\nNo need mixing misery and gin\r\nSo it goes for icy days, heartache and slick highways\r\nNo time to wait, you're gonna break\r\nIf you bend and bend again\n\n\n\nBut a fresh new start will warm your heart\n\nLike the sun breaking through a cloudy sky\n\n\n\nIf ever was a good day\n\nIt's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nJust like a red eye flight\n\nTwo tail lights in the night\n\nYou're gon' spread your wings and fly\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nJust like a westbound train\n\nYou're drinking cheap champagne\n\nGot no more tears to cry\n\nAnd you're long gone like a whisper in the wind\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nBye bye, bye bye\n\n\n\nNo need in naming names, players love playing games\n\nAnd he played your heart like a little violin\n\nIt's brand new rhyme and riddle, it's your turn to play that fiddle\n\nAnd that same old song and dance is coming to an end\n\n\n\n'Cause a fresh new start will warm your heart\n\nLike the sun breaking through a cloudy sky\n\n\n\nIf ever was a good day\n\nIt's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nJust like a red eye flight\n\nTwo tail lights in the night\n\nYou're gon' spread your wings and fly\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nJust like a westbound train\n\nYou're drinking cheap champagne\n\nGot no more tears to cry\n\nAnd you're long gone like a whisper in the wind\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nBye bye, bye bye\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\n\n\nIf he really wants a goodbye kiss\n\nHe must be out of his ever-loving mind\n\nIf he really wants a goodbye kiss\n\nYou tell him to go kiss it where the sun don't shine\n\n\n\nIf ever was a good day\n\nIt's the day that boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nJust like a red eye flight\n\nTwo tail lights in the night\n\nYou're gon' spread your wings and fly\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\nJust like a westbound train\n\nYou're drinking cheap champagne\n\nGot no more tears to cry\n\nAnd you're long gone like a whisper in the wind\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye\n\n\n\nYou're out like a light, like a red eye flight\n\nLike two tail lights in the dusty midnight\n\nHe's out of mind, you're out of sight\n\nThat ship has sailed, that shit don't fly\n\nYou're gone like a train, like a westbound train\n\nWith a one way ticket, drinking cheap champagne\n\nFlush him down the drain 'cause there's no more tears to cry\n\nAnd you're long gone like a whisper in the wind\n\nThat boy can kiss that girl goodbye"
