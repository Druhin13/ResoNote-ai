  "title": "It Might As Well Be Spring",
  "lyrics": "The things I used to like, I don't like any more,\rI want a lot of other things I've never had before,\rIt's just like my mamma says, I sit around and mourn\rPretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored\rI'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,\rI'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,\rI'd say that I had spring fever,\rBut I know it isn't spring.\rI'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,\rLike a nightingale without a song to sing.\rOh, why should I have spring fever,\rWhen it isn't even spring?\rI keep wishing I were somewhere else,\rWalking down a strange new street,\rHearing words I have never never heard,\rFrom a man I've yet to meet.\rI'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,\rI'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,\rI haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,\rOr a robin or a bluebird on the wing,\rBut I feel so gay in a melancholy way,\rThat it might as well be spring,\rIt might as well be, might as well be,\rIt might as well be spring."
