  "lyrics": "You said you didn't know her name yesterday\r\nBut now you've got her stayin' later on\r\nIn whispered press a lash is left on her cheek\r\nJust brush it off you got her feelin' weak\r\nAfter practice you were sitting on the lawn\n\nWhile she was laughin' in the sun\n\n\n\nYou sure know how to drop that guillotine on me\n\nThough you would never wanna see me bleed\n\nI'll just wipe off my neck then leave you in between\n\nYou sure know how to kill me\n\n\n\nI saw you lookin' back a lot yesterday\n\nThinkin' how could you get this goin' on\n\nIn whispered press her lips said yes, dance with me\n\nJust pull her close you got her feelin' weak\n\n\n\nIn the middle of darkness after everybody's gone\n\nShe'll be lookin' back at you for the dawn\n\n\n\nYou sure know how to drop that guillotine on me\n\nThough you would never wanna see me bleed\n\nI'll just wipe off my neck then leave you in between\n\nYou sure know how to kill me\n\nYou sure know how to drop that guillotine on me\n\nThough you would never wanna see me bleed\n\nI'll just wipe off my neck then leave you in between\n\nYou sure know how to kill me"
