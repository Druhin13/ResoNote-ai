  "lyrics": "I'm glad that you're well\r\nI know that you feel the same\r\nFor me I can tell\r\nJust look how far we've come\r\nIt's not in me to fail\r\nNominations, I knew it would all come with patience\n\nQuestioning what I'm making\n\nIs he real? Did he fake it?\n\nAnd now that I'm out all the time\n\nI know that you worry\n\nIs he safe? Does he love me?\n\nI only ask that you trust me\n\nYeah\n\nSo I'll always let you know\n\nYeah\n\nThat I'm good while I'm on\n\n\n\nJust know I got you\n\nGirl I always got you\n\nWhatever we go through\n\nJust know I got you\n\nAlways thinking about you\n\nYou stay on my mind\n\nI have to stay on my grind\n\nI'm never wasting your time\n\nI'm just waiting on mine\n\nJust know I got you\n\nGirl I always got you\n\nWhatever we go through\n\nJust know I got you\n\nAlways thinking about you\n\nYou stay on my mind\n\nI have to stay on my grind\n\nI'm never wasting your time\n\nI'm just waiting on mine\n\n\n\nAnd it's like\n\nYou knew the kinda picture that I had for us\n\nNow you're trying to tell me that you're camera shy\n\nI just wanna save the world\n\nEven Jesus Christ couldn't do it without sacrifice\n\nAnd I need sacrifice, but you want all of me\n\nYou think that I'm ignoring you\n\nBut I got award shows ignoring me\n\nForget other women\n\nKodak Black, I got tunnel vision\n\nYou ain't checking who's calling me\n\nThat's because you're the only person in my corner\n\nThat's prepared to think more of me\n\nBut all you see is dinner on the date\n\nTruth in the things that you didn't wanna say\n\nBig figures, Chinchillas sitting in the range\n\nI ain't giving it away\n\nBut you're silent\n\nThat's why I'm here singing in the rain\n\n\n\nJust know I got you\n\nGirl I always got you\n\nWhatever we go through\n\nJust know I got you\n\nAlways thinking about you\n\nYou stay on my mind\n\nI have to stay on my grind\n\nI'm never wasting your time\n\nI'm just waiting on mine\n\nJust know I got you\n\nGirl I always got you\n\nWhatever we go through\n\nJust know I got you\n\nAlways thinking about you\n\nYou stay on my mind\n\nI have to stay on my grind\n\nI'm never wasting your time\n\nI'm just waiting on mine\n\n\n\nJust know I got you\n\nGirl I always got you, got you\n\nWhatever we go through\n\nJust know I got you\n\nAlways thinking about you\n\nYou stay on, you stay on my mind\n\nI have to stay on my grind\n\nI'm never wasting your time\n\nI'm just waiting on mine"
