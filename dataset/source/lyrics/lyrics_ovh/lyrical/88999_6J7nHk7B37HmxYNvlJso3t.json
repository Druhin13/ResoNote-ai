  "lyrics": "You live halfway\r\nIn a transient home off the highway\r\nDidn't mama tell you\r\nThere's so much to see\r\nThere's a silver lining\r\nAnd a ripping seam\n\n\n\nEverything's overrated\n\nI'm watching from too close\n\nI'll take one ticket to heaven\n\nDress up as the Holy Ghost\n\n\n\nGot your head in the clouds\n\nAnd two eyes on the shaking ground\n\nI loved you from the petty view\n\nAnd watched you like the daily news\n\nRehearsing what's reality\n\nWhat chaos is imaginary\n\n\n\nIn the bleachers\n\nSomeone teaches\n\nAbout what's worth knowing\n\nSome bland candy scheme\n\nBuild yourself some boundaries\n\nJust to kill the dream\n\n\n\nGot your meds and your sky\n\nYou plant the moon in someone's eyes\n\nI did that too\n\nI loved him and his violence for the pretty view\n\nRehearsed a strange reality\n\nWhat chaos is imaginary"
