  "lyrics": "Please don't be so bad\r\nI still feel you there\r\nTears, they fell so many\r\nHow could I be so wrong?\r\nHow could I be so strong?\r\nNothing else compares\n\nHow could I be so wrong?\n\nHow could I be so strong?\n\n\n\nI came to find death, I stayed for life\n\nI came here foolish, I left here wise\n\nI'm waiting for something I can't deny\n\nA truth, a sermon, a sacrifice\n\nI wanna wake up and all is love\n\nForget the trouble I made up\n\nThe waves are coming across the shore\n\nThese dreams of mine go on and on\n\n\n\nHow could I be so wrong?\n\nHow could I be so wrong?\n\n\n\nI came to find death, I stayed for life\n\nI came here foolish, I left here wise\n\nI'm waiting for something I can't deny\n\nA truth, a sermon, a sacrifice\n\nI wanna wake up and all is love\n\nForget the trouble I made up\n\nThe waves are coming across the shore\n\nThese dreams of mine go on and on"
