  "lyrics": "Yeah, well I may go through this life never knowing who I am\r\nAnd why I'm here, and why I'm doing what I'm doing\r\nI guess I'll just go with whatever my name is\r\nAnd take for word everything I've learned from my father\r\nAnd my father's father\n\nThey were making it up, were making it all up\n\nWhat else can we do?\n\nYeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up\n\nIt's the only way to get through\n\n'Cause life's so hard but life's alright\n\nBecause I'm here with you tonight\n\nMaking it up, we're making it all up\n\n\n\nSome people think the world revolves around them\n\nAnd their beautiful child\n\nSome people like to pile things up around them\n\nAnd surround themselves with a beautiful lie\n\n\n\nAnd we're making it up, we're making it all up\n\nWhat else can we do?\n\nYeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up\n\nIt's the only way to get through\n\n'Cause life's so hard but life's alright\n\nBecause I'm here with you tonight\n\nMaking it up, we're making it all up\n\n\n\nAnd there's more to this life\n\nMore than what you see\n\nIt's true what they say\n\nThat life is but a dream\n\nSo row your boat gently\n\nGently down that stream\n\nAnd keep dreaming your dream\n\n\n\nKeep on making it up, making it all up\n\nWhat else can we do?\n\nYeah, we're making it up, we're making it all up\n\nIt's the only way to get through\n\n'Cause life's so hard but life's alright\n\nBecause I'm here with you tonight\n\nMaking it up, we're making it all up"
