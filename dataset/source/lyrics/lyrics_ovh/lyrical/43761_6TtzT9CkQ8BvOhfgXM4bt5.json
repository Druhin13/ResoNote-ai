  "lyrics": "I'll be the soldier out on the front line\r\nYou be the courage in my heart to fight\r\nI'll be the outlaw, bounty on my head\r\nYou be my shelter, a safe place to rest\r\nI'll be the weakness, you be the stayin' strong\n\nI'll be the sunrise, you be the all night long\n\n\n\nAh darlin' you're the only perfect part of me\n\nWithout you my life is incomplete\n\nOur love's a melody that lingers on\n\nI'll be the singer, you be the song\n\nI'll be the singer, you be, you be the song\n\n\n\nI'll be the sinner out in the back row\n\nYou be salvation, savin' my soul\n\nI'll be the sailor out on ragin' seas\n\nYou be the lighthouse guiding me\n\n\n\nI'll be the weakness, you be the stayin' strong\n\nI'll be the sunrise, you be the all night long\n\n\n\nAh darlin' you're the only perfect part of me\n\nWithout you my life is incomplete\n\nOur love's a melody that lingers on\n\nI'll be the singer, you be the song\n\nI'll be the singer, you be, you be the song\n\n\n\nI'll be the weakness, you be the stayin' strong\n\nI'll be the sunrise, you be the all night long\n\n\n\nAh darlin' you're the only perfect part of me\n\nWithout you my life is incomplete\n\nOur love's a melody that lingers on\n\nI'll be the singer, you be the song\n\nI'll be the singer, you be, you be the song"
