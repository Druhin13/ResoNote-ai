  "lyrics": "Stop that train: I'm leavin', today!\nStop that train: I'm leavin', anyway!\nStop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:\nIt won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;\nI said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.\n\n\nAll my good life I've been a lonely man,\n\nTeachin' my people who don't understand;\n\nAnd even though I tried my best,\n\nI still can't find no happiness.\n\n\n\nSo I got to say:\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin', oh, baby now!\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin', don't care what you say!\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:\n\nIt won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;\n\nSaid, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.\n\n\n\nSome goin' east; and-a some goin' west,\n\nSome stand aside to try their best.\n\nSome livin' big, but the most is livin' small::\n\nThey just can't even find no food at all.\n\n\n\nI mean, stop it:\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin', leavin', mm-hmm.\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin', I don't mind!\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:\n\nIt won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;\n\nI said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.\n\n\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin', leavin'!\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin', can't take it!\n\nStop that train: I'm leavin',got to be better!\n\nIt won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;\n\nI said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong."
