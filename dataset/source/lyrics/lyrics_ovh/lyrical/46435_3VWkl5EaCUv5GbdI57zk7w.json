  "lyrics": "We're sick as the devil and tired as sin\r\nWe're closer to love than we ever have been\r\nThey told us that fear was a howling wind\r\nAnd if there was ever a storm we are weathering it\r\nAnd all things we saw\n\nThey were not our fault\n\nWe're never taught how to love\n\nAnd never got to be young\n\n\n\nAnd if love is a war\n\nIt isn't love anymore\n\nAnd the heart is a cage\n\nIf the heart doesn't change\n\n\n\nAnd it's all or nothing now\n\nOr it's all for nothing\n\n\n\nMy mother found solace in hiding her pain\n\nMy father a shepherd no sheep to his name\n\n\n\nI learned to keep all my feelings inside\n\nWith a mother to face and a father to fight\n\n\n\nOh but if love is a war\n\nIt isn't love anymore\n\nAnd the heart is a cage\n\nIf the heart doesn't change\n\n\n\nAnd it's all or nothing now\n\nOr it's all for nothing now\n\nAnd it's all or nothing now\n\nOr it's all for nothing\n\n\n\nOh woah oh, oh woah oh oh oh\n\nOh woah oh, oh woah oh oh oh\n\n\n\nAnd I thought I heard your voice\n\nHeard it raise above the grain\n\nThought I heard your voice\n\nThought I heard your voice say\n\n\n\nIt's all or nothing now\n\nOr it's all for nothing\n\n\n\nOh woah oh, oh woah oh oh oh\n\nOh woah oh, oh woah oh oh oh\n\nOh woah oh, oh woah oh oh oh\n\nOh woah oh, oh woah oh oh oh"
