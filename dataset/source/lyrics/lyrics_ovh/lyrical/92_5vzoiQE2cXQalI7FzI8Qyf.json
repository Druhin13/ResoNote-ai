  "lyrics": "Kindly disregard this one feeling\r\nMy clothes on the floor can be misleading\r\nAs soon as they're unpacked, they'll need to be put back\r\nTo me, it always seems I am leaving\r\nYes, to me it always seems I am leaving\n\nThis be can be decieving\n\n'Cause my time here is so fleeting\n\nThese bones hold the load of the open road\n\nTo me, it always seems I am leaving\n\nWell, to me it just seems I am leaving\n\n\n\nAs soon as I arrive, I must say goodbye\n\nAll this despite my pleading\n\nThose relentless miles are never satisfied\n\nNever say you're here to stay\n\n\n\nTangled friends start unweaving\n\nLike a thread from a quilt receding\n\nEven though I'm home, I feel the most alone\n\nTo me, it always seems I am leaving\n\nWell, to me it always seems I am leaving\n\n\n\nAs soon as I arrive, I must say goodbye\n\nAll this despite my pleading\n\nThose relentless miles are never satisfied\n\nNever say you're here to stay\n\n\n\nThere's no point in grieving, this pattern is just repeating\n\nI've seen those tears before and there's something I ignore\n\nTo me it always seems I am leaving\n\nWell, to me it always seems I am gone"
