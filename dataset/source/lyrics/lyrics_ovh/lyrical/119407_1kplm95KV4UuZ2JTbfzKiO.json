Hey, I'm Ricky, if you don't know me you can come up to me, don't feel uncomfortable. I, I know... I know I give off a stand-offish vibe... I don't feel uncomfortable. We'll talk, come up to me, we'll talk about the boys, we'll celebrate today. Today is about celebrating the lives of two legends. Before we start sharing stories, I would like everybody to bow their head for ten seconds, in remembrance"
