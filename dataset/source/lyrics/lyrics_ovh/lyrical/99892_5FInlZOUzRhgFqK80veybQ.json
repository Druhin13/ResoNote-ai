  "lyrics": "My favorite pastime is\r\nGetting lost beneath your eyelids\r\nI can't stop staring at you\r\nAnd lately, my heartbeat's been studying your body\r\nNow I know just what to do\n\nI don't know nobody\n\nLike I know your body\n\nEvery shape, every curve\n\nEvery twist and every turn\n\nI don't want nobody\n\nIf it ain't your body\n\nI'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see\n\n'Cause nobody knows your body like me\n\n\n\nEach freckle, I outline\n\nI'll keep on taking my time\n\nKissing the space in between (kissing the space in between)\n\nSpend all day admiring\n\nYour dimples when you're smiling\n\nSo keep on smiling at me\n\n\n\nI don't know nobody\n\nLike I know your body\n\nEvery shape, every curve\n\nEvery twist and every turn\n\nI don't want nobody\n\nIf it ain't your body\n\nI'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see\n\n'Cause nobody knows your body like me\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll ace any pop quiz, baby, with my eyes closed\n\n'Cause I know every inch from your head to your toes\n\n\n\nI don't know nobody\n\nLike I know your body\n\nEvery shape, every curve\n\nEvery twist and every turn\n\nI don't want nobody\n\nIf it ain't your body\n\nI'll keep you forever satisfied, you'll see (oh oh oh oh)\n\n'Cause nobody knows your body like\n\nNobody knows your body like\n\nNobody knows your body like me"
