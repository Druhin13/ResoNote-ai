  "lyrics": "I got back into town\r\nYou tracked me down\r\nLike they said you would\r\nYou finally found the time\r\nTo apologize\n\nLike they said you should\n\n\n\nI won't say that I fell\n\nFor some kind of trap\n\nFor some sort of scheme\n\n\n\nJust that I certainly fell\n\nIt doesn't matter why\n\nDoesn't matter how\n\n\n\nWhy\n\nWe know but you won't\n\n\n\nI heard you found another girl\n\nTo occupy your mind\n\nIt's a matter of time\n\n\n\nShe's the saddest girl that I\n\nThat I have ever seen\n\nBut you see her in your dreams\n\n\n\nUntil you washed your hands so clean\n\nWe never would have seen\n\nJust leave her in your dreams"
