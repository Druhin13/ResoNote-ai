  "lyrics": "How much longer will I witness injustice\r\nForced to watch the wicked triumph\r\nThe defeat in hopelessness\r\nAs justice perverts itself\r\nEvery ounce of suffering\n\nWrithing like a sickness\n\nThe blackened sky falls before man\n\n\n\nToo pure to see the evil\n\nBetrayed every unwavered soul\n\n\n\nWhy is there silence when hope burns\n\nWhen will judgement take us and put an end to apathy\n\nThe plague will come\n\nFor the revelation awaits\n\nThe fury will see the end of all\n\n\n\nIn wrath remember humanity"
