  "lyrics": "I would climb any mountain\r\nSail across a stormy sea\r\nIf that's what it takes me baby\r\nTo show you how much you mean to me\r\nAnd I guess it's just the woman in you\r\nThat brings out the man in me\n\nI know I can't help myself\n\nYou're all in the world to me\n\n\n\nIt feels like the first time\n\nFeels like the very first time\n\nIt Feels like the first time\n\nIt Feels like the very first time\n\n\n\nI have waited a lifetime\n\nSpent my time so foolishly\n\nBut now that I've found you\n\nTogether we'll make history\n\n\n\nAnd I know that it must be the woman in you\n\nThat brings out the man in me\n\nI know I can't help myself\n\nYou're all that my eyes can see\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like the first time\n\nLike it never did before\n\nFeels like the first time\n\nLike we've opened up the door\n\nFeels like the first time\n\nLike it never will again, never again\n\n\n\nFeels like the first time, it feels like the first time\n\nIt feels like the very first time, very, very, it feels\n\nIt feels like the first time, oh it feels like the first time\n\nIt feels like the very first time\n\n\n\nOpen up the door, won't you open up the door? Yeah\n\n\n\nFeels like the first time\n\nAnd it feels like the very first time\n\nAnd it feels like the first time\n\nIt feels like the very first time\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like the first time\n\nIt feels like the very first time\n\nOh it feels, it feels like the first time\n\nYeah it feels like the first time"
