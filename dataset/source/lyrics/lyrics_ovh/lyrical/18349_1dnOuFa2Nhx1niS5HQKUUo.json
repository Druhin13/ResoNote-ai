  "lyrics": "The other day, I was thinking to myself\r\nMade a list of all my mistakes\r\nOh, I wish I could've run to you\r\nAnd tell you all about my heartbreak\r\nAnd I wondered to myself \"Wait a minute\r\nAm I even on the right path now?\"\n\nHad a couple wins, but I got knocked down\n\nBut I know if you were still around, you would say\n\n\n\nSometimes you lose, sometimes you win\n\nYou gotta get up, up again\n\nKeep holding on, it's not the end\n\n\n\nYou gotta get up, up again\n\nYou can get up, up again\n\nYou can get up, up again\n\n\n\nAnd I guess not every little thing\n\nWorks out just the way you dreamed\n\nYou can take a couple wrong turns\n\nStill end up where you're supposed to be\n\nAnd even though in a moment\n\nI know anything can change\n\nYou're perfect plans might fall apart\n\nBut the simple truth remains\n\n\n\nSometimes you lose, sometimes you win\n\nYou gotta get up, up again\n\nKeep holding on, it's not the end\n\n\n\nYou gotta get up, up again\n\nYou, you can get up, up again\n\nYou can get up, up again\n\nYou, you can get up, up again\n\nYou can get up, up again\n\n\n\n'Cause you've only got one life\n\nAnd you don't know when it ends\n\nYou've only got one heart\n\nSo get out there and live\n\nYeah, you've only got one life\n\nDon't let it get away\n\nEveryone falls down\n\nBut you can get up, up again\n\n\n\nYou, you can get up, up again\n\nYou can get up, up again\n\n\n\nAnd I guess not every little thing\n\nWorks out just the way you dreamed\n\nYou can take a couple wrong turns\n\nStill end up where you're supposed to be"
