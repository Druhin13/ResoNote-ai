  "lyrics": "Where's your heaven?\r\n[?]\r\nCan't touch your skin without leaving scars, scars\r\nAnd your body rocks from side to side\r\nYou're still on my mind\n\nAnd here's to nothing\n\nJust the touch of your skin could be enough\n\nBut you're not here\n\nAre you sleeping, are you sleeping at all?\n\nHave we said it all?\n\n\n\nWill you hunt me down?\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\nWill you hunt me down\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\n\n\nWhat am I missing\n\nYour concrete thoughts and your liquid sense of vision\n\nWon't you stay awhile and paint me right on you\n\nWon't you stay awhile and paint me something new\n\nHave we said it all?\n\n\n\nWill you hunt me down?\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\nWill you hunt me down\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\n\n\nOh did you get it right, take a little time\n\nDid you fight, did you wait awhile\n\nAnd did you get your freedom?\n\n\n\nWhoa, did you get it right, take a little time\n\nDid you fight, did you wait awhile\n\nAnd did you get your freedom?\n\n\n\nOh did you get it right, take a little time\n\nDid you fight, did you wait awhile\n\nDid you get your freedom?\n\n\n\nOh did you get it right, take a little time\n\nDid you fight, did you wait awhile\n\nDid you get your freedom?\n\n\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\n\n\nWill you hunt me down?\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\nWill you hunt me down\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it\n\nMaybe you're a bad idea but I'm loving every minute of it"
