  "lyrics": "Hurricanes in December-earthquakes in the heartland\r\nBad air index on a flashing warning sign\r\nBound for trouble-the picture is dirty\r\nWe'll know when we get there\r\nIf we'll find mercy\n\n\n\nFlotsam and Jetsam in charge of the agency\n\nWhere truth gets twisted in danger of dissolving \n\nWhen war is profit and profit is war\n\n\n\nWe'll know when we get there\n\nIf we'll find mercy\n\n\n\nCertified minds exacting a toll\n\nTrying to fit a square block in a round hole\n\nA heart of darkness facing 1000 bloodshot eyes\n\n\n\nWe'll know when we get there\n\nIf we'll find mercy"
