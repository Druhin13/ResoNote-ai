  "lyrics": "You're better off alone.\r\nYou're better when you're by yourself,\r\nJust hanging out at home\r\nWith no one to talk to.\r\nYou've done this all before.\r\nYou're good at keeping your opinion\n\nTo yourself, a bore.\n\nNow your frustrations.\n\n\n\nCall me oblivious, don't call me at all.\n\n\n\nYou're better off alone.\n\nYou're better when you're by yourself,\n\nHanging out alone.\n\nWith no one there to talk through.\n\nYou had it all before.\n\nMaking sure the one you want\n\nIs you and you some more.\n\nNow your frustrations.\n\n\n\nCall me oblivious, don't call me at all.\n\nCall me oblivious, don't call me at all.\n\n\n\nI've seen better days, but long seems like they've all left but easier to hide yourself away.\n\n(I've had so long, it's difficult I'm happy and I wouldn't have have it, wouldn't have it any other way.)\n\nI've got better ways, but now it's such a mess and it's easier to hide yourself be a different person.\n\n(Sometimes it's so so wrong, it doesn't really matter what I do or what I do or what I say.)\n\n\n\nSo go on make your own regrets,\n\nIt's easier decision making\n\nAll the fun is all the faking.\n\n\n\nTell me how to be a better person.\n\n(Tell me how to be better.)\n\nPlease tell me how to move on.\n\nSomebody tell me what I'm waiting to find.\n\n\n\nYou're better off alone,\n\nYou're better when you're by yourself,\n\nJust hanging out at home,\n\nWith no one to talk to."
