  "lyrics": "Unwrapped in paper\r\nIt never phased her when I give\r\nTo hold on was all but gone in an instant\r\nI could not blame her\r\nI didn't stay enough to wish\r\nAnd one priest could not absolve me of my sins, yeah\n\n\n\nSome time ago now\n\nGave up my post I left behind\n\nCause she wanted what she always thought felt right\n\nBut since I've come down\n\nFrom that old mountain I had climbed\n\nI heard that she's still searching for her good sign\n\n\n\nStay low, swim to home, hold tight\n\nCause it looks rough on the front tonight\n\nLost my way, once or twice but I won't sway in a fight\n\nDo I pray? No, but I have faith you might\n\n\n\nI did not sleep but still I can't see what it has become\n\nWhen she held it all against us in the long run\n\nMaybe I'm focused on something other than some love\n\nBut only ever thought that when I was young\n\n\n\nStay low, swim to home, hold tight\n\nCause it looks rough on the front tonight\n\nLost my way, once or twice but I won't sway in a fight\n\nDo I pray? No, but I have faith you might\n\n\n\nUnderneath my skin you exist\n\nI cannot get rid of all of it\n\nUp too late to shout so I quit\n\nAnd I don't give a shit, hmm\n\n\n\nStay low, swim to home, hold tight\n\nCause it looks rough on the front tonight, tonight oh\n\nLost my way, once or twice but I won't sway in a fight\n\nDo I pray? No, but I have faith you might\n\nDo I pray? No, but I have faith you might\n\n\n\nDo I pray? No, but I have faith you might"
