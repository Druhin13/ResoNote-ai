[shot]\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nJust give it to homes in different locations,\n\nJust make one a little more spacious;\n\nAnd two rollies dipped in gold faces,\n\nAnd two girls that's known to switch places!\n\nReady? Let's get that!\n\nLet's get that! - Let's go!\n\nLemme know if you with that!\n\nYou with that? - Let's go!\n\n\n\nJust give me two yellow bones with cute faces,\n\nGotta be bad can never be basic!\n\nTV screens is looking like \"Matrix\",\n\nCars so fast, the police can't chase it!\n\nReady? Let's get that!\n\nLet's get that! - Let's go!\n\nLemme know if you with that!\n\nYou with that? - Let's go, we can get it now!\n\n\n\n[Verse 1:]\n\nSee? Everybody act like they the man to watch,\n\nBut I don't even see 'em runnin' half the block!\n\nInfluenced by the Michael Watts and Rapalots,\n\nI won a Grammy and I still ain't-took-it-out the box!\n\nWhen-I-was-comin'-up, I never had a lot!\n\nSo now I want it all, I gotta have ya spot!\n\nNow everybody actin' like it's candy drops,\n\nBut they bitin' like when Tyson and Evander box.\n\nOh, well-I-still-will-ride-fresh switch 'Lacs every season,\n\nKick a door down my raps what they needin'.\n\nCouple bad women that'll pledge their allegiance,\n\nNever broke hoes, coach bags are deceivin'!\n\nTwo straps on me, never-dealin'-with-a pat down\n\nWhile-I'm-walkin'-to-the-private-jet in the background!\n\nI ain't see a throne, that's why I never sat down!\n\nPass-it-to-the-king like cats out in Sac-Town!\n\nNo Demarcus, I don't give a damn, it's no instagram, I'm just into Cham'!\n\nOpen hands and then enter grands; anythin' I got, I'm gon' get again!\n\nKillin' all y'all, tell me what do y'all call!\n\nBad-guy-that-never-pass! I'm-the-villain-ball-hog!\n\nYou on the come up but I'm playin' \"duck hunt\",\n\nWhen I put my guns up, that's the day that y'all fall!\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Verse 2:]\n\nYou ain't playin' in the game; you a lame, you a mascot!\n\nAlways-tryna-criticize the things that we rap 'bout,\n\nWhile-I'm movin'-like-a-pair-of-J's on the blacktop;\n\nYou don't run a thing but out of space on your laptop!\n\nI'm a-start-a-tab my change never max out\n\nMain broke rapper, main one pullin' cash out!\n\nI'm a-have-yo'-woman on swangs in my Lac drop.\n\nYou don't like it? You-can-catch-a-fade like a flat top.\n\nLame get a name, y'all lames tell 'em: \"That's hot! \"\n\nNot me! I-say-I-never-bought-it, boy!\n\nI'm-comin'-for-the-money like an auditor,\n\nLook how I murdered everybody that-you-thought-was-raw!\n\nIt don't mean that you made it if you on a tour;\n\nYou're not a headliner if you're on a four!\n\nAnybody got beef, I'm a carnivore,\n\nDon't-make-me-rain-on-your-parade like it's Mardi Gras!\n\nNot Mardi Gras, it's not February! Not January, it's Ben & Jerr!\n\nMixed with some liquor, it's a Bloody Mary; such a nasty flow it's unsanitary!\n\nGettin' motion sickness cause I roll the sickest\n\nOn the road to riches and you know the bidness;\n\nCause the flow is vicious, you supposed to witness;\n\nWhen-I-get-it, I'm a-be-like: \"What I told you, snitches? \"\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Bridge:]\n\nShoow tiiime! (shoooow tiiiiiime!) Turn dooooown theee liiiights, it's shoow tiiiiime! (damn riiiight!)\n\nAnd this woooorld iiiis miiiiine, no liiiieeee! (noooo liiiieeee!)\n\nTurn uuuup theee briiiights an' let's shiiiiine, (aaaaaal-riiiiight!)\n\nCause this woooorld iiiis miiiiine, hmmmmm!\n\n\n\n[Outro:]\n\nShould never be a question in your mind about it!\n\nStay loaded! [gun cocks]\n\nChamillitary!\n\nSee? You call it motivation... [automatic gunshots]\n\nI call it... \"Ammunition\"! [shot] [beat stops]"
