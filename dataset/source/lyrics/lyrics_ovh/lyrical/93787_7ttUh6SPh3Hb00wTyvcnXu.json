  "lyrics": "Only lonely for you at night\r\nOnly lonely for you at night\r\nThe sun doesn't shine\r\nAnd I try to forget why\r\nWhy you're not here by my side\r\nOnly lonely for you at night, ah\n\n\n\nMade it through another day\n\nDon't even feel the pain, it's fading\n\nI've been cleaning out my brain\n\nI quit you like cocaine, life changing\n\n\n\nI start to panic when the sun goes down\n\nI stay this jacked 'til the lights go out\n\nI don't wanna go back home\n\nDon't wanna be alone right now\n\n\n\nNo, you're never gonna see me cry\n\nI already got a brand new life\n\nDon't you know I'm moving on\n\nAnd everyday I'm stronger\n\nI don't even know you're gone\n\n\n\nOnly lonely for you at night\n\nOnly lonely for you at night\n\nThe sun doesn't shine\n\nAnd I try to forget why\n\nWhy you're not here by my side\n\nOnly lonely for you at night, ah\n\n\n\nWide awake, I'm in the dark\n\nThe spiral in my heart is storming, yeah\n\nI just gotta close my eyes and\n\nKnow that I'll survive 'til morning\n\n\n\nI start to panic when the sun goes down\n\nI stay this jacked 'til the lights go out\n\nI just wanna call your phone\n\nDon't wanna be alone right now\n\n\n\nNo, you're never gonna see me cry\n\nI already got a brand new life\n\nDon't you know I'm moving on\n\nAnd everyday I'm stronger\n\nI don't even know you're gone\n\n(I don't even know that you're gone)\n\n\n\nOnly lonely for you at night (I'm only lonely for you)\n\nOnly lonely for you at night\n\nThe sun doesn't shine\n\nAnd I try to forget why (Oh, try to forget)\n\nWhy you're not here by my side (Ooh, ooh)\n\nOnly lonely for you at night, ah\n\n\n\nI'm only lonely for you\n\nI'm only lonely for you"
