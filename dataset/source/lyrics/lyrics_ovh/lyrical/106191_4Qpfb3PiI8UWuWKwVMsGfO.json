  "lyrics": "You've been walking alone for so long\r\nAnd you’ve been building a wall around your heart\r\nBut I promise there is a light at the end of this long ride, woah\r\nThis time I know you'll be alright 'cause I’m standing at your side, woah\n\n'Cause when you feel like you've been falling\n\nHold on to me\n\nAnd when the river sweeps you right off your feet\n\nHold on to me\n\nOoh, hold on to me\n\nOoh, hold on to me\n\n\n\nLife, an ocean, keeps pulling your anchor down\n\nDeep in darkness and you can't hear a sound\n\n\n\nBut I promise there is a light at the end of this long ride, woah\n\nThis time I know you'll be alright 'cause I'm standing at your side, woah\n\n\n\n'Cause when you feel like you’ve been falling\n\nHold on to me\n\nAnd when the river sweeps you right off your feet\n\nHold on to me\n\nOoh, hold on to me\n\nOoh, hold on to me\n\n\n\nHold on to me now\n\nI won’t let you drown\n\nHold on to me\n\nHold on to me now\n\nTake you to higher ground\n\nHold on to me (Hold on to me)\n\n\n\n'Cause when you feel like you’ve been falling\n\nHold on to me (Hold on to me)\n\nAnd when the river sweeps you right off your feet\n\nHold on to me (Hold on to me)\n\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, hold on)\n\n(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, hold on)"
