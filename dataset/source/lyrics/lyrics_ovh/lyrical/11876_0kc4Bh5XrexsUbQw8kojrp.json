  "lyrics": "We used to swim the same moonlight waters\r\nOceans away from the wakeful day\r\n- My fall will be for you -\r\nMy fall will be for you\r\nMy love will be in you\n\nIf you be the one to cut me\n\nI`ll bleed forever\n\n\n\nScent of the sea before the waking of the world\n\nBrings me to thee\n\nInto the blue memory\n\n\n\n- My fall will be for you -\n\nMy fall will be for you\n\nMy love will be in you\n\nIf you be the one to cut me\n\nI will bleed forever\n\n\n\nInto the blue memory\n\n\n\nA siren from the deep came to me \n\nSang my name my longing\n\nStill I write my songs about that dream of mine\n\nWorth everything I may ever be\n\n\n\nThe Child will be born again\n\nThat siren carried him to me\n\nFirst of them true loves\n\nSinging on the shoulders of an angel\n\nWithout care for love n` loss\n\n\n\nBring me home or leave me be \n\nMy love in the dark heart of the night\n\nI have lost the path before me\n\nThe one behind will lead me\n\n\n\nTake me\n\nCure me\n\nKill me\n\nBring me home\n\nEvery way\n\nEvery day\n\nJust another loop in the hangman`s noose\n\n\n\nTake me, cure me, kill me, bring me home\n\nEvery way, every day\n\nI keep on watching us sleep\n\n\n\nRelive the old sin of Adam and Eve\n\nOf you and me\n\nForgive the adoring beast\n\n\n\nRedeem me into childhood\n\nShow me myself without the shell\n\nLike the advent of May\n\nI`ll be there when you say\n\nTime to never hold our love\n\n\n\n- My fall will be for you -\n\nMy fall will be for you\n\nMy love will be in you\n\nYou were the one to cut me\n\nSo I`ll bleed forever"
