  "lyrics": "A man's dream is a brand new car\r\nA drop top F-type Jaguar\r\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\r\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\r\nWalk-in closet, thousand shoes\r\nCold Champagne in the afternoon\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\n\n\nI've been dreaming\n\nAll my life been looking for that new thing\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\n\n\nBeauty queen, it's a soft galore\n\nA big ass house with a big ass pool\n\nLook for a place that don't exist\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\nIt doesn't matter what you've got\n\nOr if you ever lost you take a shot\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\n\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\n\n\nDominos they fall inside my head\n\nI don't see 'em now, maybe later\n\nI am on a crater on the moon\n\nLeaving soon, leaving room\n\nFor this natural disaster\n\nYou just have to visualize cotton candy in the sky\n\nLemon party in disguise\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\n\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this\n\n\n\nWe look for heaven, but it's not this"
