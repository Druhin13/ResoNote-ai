  "title": "Consequences",
  "lyrics": "Dirty tissues, trust issues\r\nGlasses on the sink, they didn't fix you\r\nLonely pillows in a strangers bed\r\nLittle voices in my head\r\nSecret keeping, stop the bleeding\r\nLost a little weight because I wasn't eating\n\nAll the souls that I can't listen to, to tell the truth\n\n\n\nLoving you was young, and wild, and free\n\nLoving you was cool, and hot, and sweet\n\nLoving you was sunshine, safe and sound\n\nA steady place to let down my defenses\n\nBut loving you had consequences\n\n\n\nHesitation, awkward conversation\n\nRunning on low expectation\n\nEvery sign that I was ignoring\n\nI'm paying for it\n\n\n\nLoving you was young, and wild, and free\n\nLoving you was cool, and hot, and sweet\n\nLoving you was sunshine, safe and sound\n\nA steady place to let down my defenses\n\nBut loving you had consequences\n\n\n\nLoving you was dumb, dark and cheap\n\nLoving you still takes shots at me\n\nLoving you was sunshine, but then it poured\n\nAnd I lost so much more than my senses\n\n'Cause loving you had consequences... loving you"
