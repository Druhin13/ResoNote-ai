Remember when we begun?\n\nI never meant to disrupt, you promised we'll stay in touch\n\nI know I'm only silence but if you don't wanna stay\n\nYou can let me be your puppy dog leading you astray, fuck\n\n\n\nYou're just a broken little toy\n\nYou silly little boy\n\nBroken little toy\n\nYou silly little boy\n\n\n\nYou're just a broken little toy\n\nYou silly little boy\n\nBroken little toy\n\nYou're just a silly little boy\n\n\n\nSorry for what I get\n\nI'm burning down your money to light a cigarette\n\nI'm not for sale, I'm not for rent\n\nI never repent, yes, yes, yes\n\nI teach a class in sinning, I'm always winning\n\nJust for you, fortitious revenue\n\nSorry for what I get\n\nI'm burning down your money to light a cigarette\n\nI'm not for sale, I'm not for rent\n\nI never repent, yes, yes, yes\n\nI teach a class in sinning, I'm always winning\n\nJust for you, fortitious revenue\n\n\n\nYou're just a broken little toy\n\nYou silly little boy\n\nBroken little toy\n\nYou're just a silly little boy"
