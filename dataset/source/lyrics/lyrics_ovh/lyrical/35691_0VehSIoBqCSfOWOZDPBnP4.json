  "lyrics": "Who's there\r\nWho keeps coming on, on the line\r\nWho's there and hiding behind the lights\r\nThat ain't no shadow\r\nI know who you are\n\nEyes wide awake, so much is at stake\n\nI'm frozen in glace, need to see your face\n\nUncoil and reveal, break out of the trance\n\nOr is there something I wanna chase\n\n\n\nThe room is on fire and I'm paralyzed\n\nI whisper your name to the heart of the frame\n\nThis happens again and we just pretend\n\nNot to notice that we're haunted\n\n\n\nEyes wide awake, so much is at stake\n\nI'm frozen in place, need to see your face\n\nThe lost and the damned, we'll find our way\n\nBut something out there keeps blowing back, keeps blowing\n\n\n\nEyes wide awake so much is at stake\n\nI'm frozen in place, need to see your face\n\nThe lost and the damned, we'll find our way\n\nBut something out there keeps blowing back\n\nKeeps blowing back, blowing back\n\nLike the wind\n\nKeeps blowing back, blowing back\n\nKeeps blowing back, blowing back\n\nEyes wide awake"
