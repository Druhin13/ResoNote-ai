  "lyrics": "End of the night, end of the book\r\n[?] where nobody looks\r\nWritten in the clouds, whispers underground\r\nIf it all disappears, if it dare turn around\r\nAnd there's nothing anyone can say\n\nThat can prepare you when they take you away\n\nRolling down Main Street in the Sunday stitches\n\nWhere another one goes\n\n\n\nTell me a lie, tell me the truth\n\nWrap it with ribbons, tight like a noose\n\nA gift for the judge and the hangman as well\n\nSome are bent on heaven but here's where we dwell\n\n\n\nSomeone in the land between the lands\n\nWhere all our hope stumbles or stands\n\nVanish before we make our move\n\nThere's another one gone\n\n\n\nThe longer you stay around\n\nThe more you feel alone\n\nAll my friends are shadows\n\nStretching past the city limits\n\nAll running from the rising sun\n\n\n\nAnd there's nothing anyone can say\n\nThat can prepare you when they take you away\n\nSaturday's dreams buried on Monday's stitches\n\nThere's the way the story goes"
