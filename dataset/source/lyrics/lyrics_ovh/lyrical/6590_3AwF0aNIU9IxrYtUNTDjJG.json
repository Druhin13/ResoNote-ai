  "lyrics": "I think I'd like to shift this weight off my chest\r\nSoon as I figure out my right from my left\r\nDon't make me smoke from the golden cigar\r\nDon't make me go and wait in the car\r\nI thought the party started quarter to nine\r\nSoon after found out that I'd ruined the surprise\n\nThey all just stood there laughing loud as can be\n\nLike sugar canes my face was melting\n\n\n\nTo molasses\n\nTo molasses\n\nYou can call\n\nTo molasses\n\n\n\nSometimes I wanna trade this brain for a new\n\nAnd picking memories along with the view\n\nPlease don't mistake this for a hell of a time\n\nHold back my tears, so I don't spoil your wine\n\nI thought the party started quarter to nine\n\nFelt like an idiot for ruining the night\n\nThey all stood stinking from the salt in their sea\n\nLike sugar canes my face was melting\n\n\n\nTo molasses\n\nTo molasses\n\nYou can call\n\nTo molasses\n\n\n\nYes you can melt me\n\nThen you can swallow\n\nI'll slowly creep down your throat, and turn\n\nMy, my, my, my molasses\n\nMy, my, my, my molasses\n\nMy, my, my, my molasses\n\nYou can call\n\nMy, my, my, my molasses\n\nMy, my, my, my molasses\n\nMy, my, my, my molasses"
