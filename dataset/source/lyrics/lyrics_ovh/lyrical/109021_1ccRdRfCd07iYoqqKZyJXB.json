  "lyrics": "When it rains it pours and opens doors\r\nAnd floods the floors we thought would always keep us safe and dry\r\nAnd in the midst of sailing ships we sink our lips into the ones we love\r\nThat have to say goodbye \nAnd as I float along this ocean\n\nI can feel you like a notion that won't seem to let me go \n\n\n\nCause when I look to the sky something tells me you're here with me\n\nAnd you make everything alright \n\nAnd when I feel like I'm lost something tells me you're here with me\n\nAnd I can always find my way when you are here \n\n\n\nAnd every word I didn't say that caught up in some busy day\n\nAnd every dance on the kitchen floor we didn't dance before\n\nAnd every sunset that we'll miss I'll wrap them all up in a kiss\n\nAnd pick you up in all of this when I sail away \n\n\n\nWhether I am up or down or in or out or just plane overhead\n\nInstead it just feels like it is impossible to fly\n\nBut with you I can spread my wings\n\nto see me over everything that life may send me \n\nWhen I am hoping it won't pass me by \n\n\n\nAnd when I feel like there is no one that will ever know me\n\nthere you are to show me"
