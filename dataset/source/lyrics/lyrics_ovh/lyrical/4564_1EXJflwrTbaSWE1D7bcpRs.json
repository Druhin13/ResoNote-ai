  "lyrics": "By the way, I know\r\nI know when I've seen\r\nYou look tired and worn\r\nYou look almost beat\r\nI know where I've found\r\nWoah, baby I lost my way but I'm going home\n\n\n\nI've been stumbling down the mountain\n\nI've been stumbling by the sea\n\nI've been stumbling in the dust\n\nI can taste it on my teeth\n\nWell, I know baby I lost my way but I'm going home\n\n\n\nBeen pushing through a crowd on an empty street\n\nEverything that you worked for but still can't see\n\nBaby take it from someone who knows, I'm trying hard just to get back home\n\nOnly thing, honey, that I need is your arms around me\n\n\n\nNow the love I found, how it weighs on me\n\nAre you tired and worn or maybe I can't see?\n\nBaby don't let go\n\nOh, baby I lost my way but I'm going home"
