  "lyrics": "That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?\r\nBig enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it\r\nNow I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'\r\nAnd every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them\r\nThey never see them\n\nAnd I've got this black suit on\n\nRoamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral\n\nFive more miles 'til the road runs out\n\n\n\nI'm about to drive in the ocean\n\nI'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me\n\nKick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good\n\nTake off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good\n\n\n\nGot some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah\n\nMemory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated\n\nI woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?\n\nIf I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze\n\nEver since I lost my baby\n\n\n\nI've had this black suit on\n\nRoamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral\n\nOne more mile 'til the road runs out\n\n\n\nI'm about to drive in the ocean\n\nI'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me\n\nKick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good\n\nTake off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good\n\n\n\nI'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)\n\nDon't try stopping me\n\nI'm goin' off (Throw me a line)\n\nDon't try saving (Broke my heart)\n\nNo flares (Broke my heart)\n\nNo vest (Drove my love)\n\nAnd no fear\n\nWaves are washin' me out\n\n\n\nI'm about to drive in the ocean\n\nI'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me\n\nKick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good\n\nTake off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good\n\n\n\nDon't die"
