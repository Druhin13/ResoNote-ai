  "lyrics": "I was talking with a friend of mine, said a woman had hurt his pride\r\nTold him that she loved him so and turned around and let him go\r\nThen he said, \"You better watch your step,\r\nOr your gonna get hurt yourself\r\nSomeone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size\"\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nWhat if I love you baby?\n\nDon't do me like that\n\n\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nSomeday I might need you baby\n\nDon't do me like that\n\n\n\nListen honey, can you see? Baby, you would bury me\n\nIf you were in the public eye givin' someone else a try\n\nAnd you know you better watch your step\n\nOr you're gonna get hurt yourself\n\nSomeone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size\n\n\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDont' do me like that\n\nWhat if I love you baby?\n\nDon't, don't, don't, don't\n\n\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nWhat if I need you baby?\n\nDon't do me like that\n\n\n\n'Cause somewhere deep down inside\n\nSomeone is saying, \"Love doesn't last that long\"\n\nI got this feelin' inside night and day\n\nAnd now I can't take it no more\n\n\n\nListen honey, can you see? Baby, you would bury me\n\nIf you were in the public eye givin' someone else a try\n\nAnd you know you better watch your step\n\nOr you're gonna get hurt yourself\n\nSomeone's gonna tell you lies, cut you down to size\n\n\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nWhat if I love you baby?\n\nDon't, don't, don't, don't\n\n\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nI just might need you honey\n\nDon't do me like that\n\n\n\nWait!\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nBaby, baby, baby,\n\nDon't, don't, don't\n\n\n\nNo!\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nDon't do me like that\n\nBaby, baby, baby...\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh"
