  "lyrics": "I used to hurry a lot, I used to worry a lot \nI used to stay out till the break of day \nOh, that didn't get it, \nIt was high time I quit it \nI just couldn't carry on that way \nOh, I did some damage, I know it's true \n\nDidn't know I was so lonely , till I found you \n\nYou can go the distance \n\nWe'll find out in the long run \n\n(in the long run) \n\nWe can handle some resistance \n\nIf our love is a strong one (is a strong one) \n\nPeople talkin' about is \n\nthey got nothin' else to do \n\nWhen it all comes down we will \n\nstill come through \n\nIn the long run \n\nOoh, I want to tell you, it's a long run \n\nYou know I don't understand why you don't \n\ntreat yourself better \n\ndo the crazy things that you do \n\n'Cause all the debutantes in Houston, baby, \n\ncouldn't hold a candle to you \n\nDid you do it for love? \n\nDid you do it for money? \n\nDid you do it for spite? \n\nDid you think you had to, honey? \n\nWho is gonna make it? \n\nWe'll find out in the long run \n\n(in the long run) \n\nI know we can take it \n\nif our love is a strong one \n\n(is a strong one) \n\nWell, we're scared, but we ain't shakin' \n\nKinda bent, but we ain't breakin' \n\nin the long run \n\nOoh, I want to tell you, it's a long run \n\nin the long run \n\nin the long run, [etc.]"
