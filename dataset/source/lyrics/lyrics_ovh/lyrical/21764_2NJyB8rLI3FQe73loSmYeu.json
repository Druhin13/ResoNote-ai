  "lyrics": "Nothing outside\nThere is nothing outside\nAnd so much confusion in my mind\nOver the trees and far away\nI fly with the bees under the rain\nMy fucking crown\n\nSlowly kills me\n\nIt's making me feel so bored and dumb\n\nUp in the sky and down on earth\n\nI try to go on with my research\n\nNothing is outside\n\nNothing is outside\n\nDriving my car\n\nAll day long, babe\n\nSometimes I truly ask myself\n\nWhat kind of life I'm gonna live?\n\nI'm just a clinical disease\n\nNothing is outside\n\nNothing is outside"
