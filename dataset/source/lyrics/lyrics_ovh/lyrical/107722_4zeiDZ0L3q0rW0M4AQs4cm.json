  "lyrics": "The glass ain't half full\r\nThe clock just struck twelve\r\nNot easy to understand what time ya leave\r\nThe last man he probably wondered the same\r\nThe past is on the phone\n\nNew roads don't pave themselves\n\n\n\nGo find your vegetarian\n\nFor who am I to doubt\n\nDon't leave a note or feed the cat\n\nAnd shoes don't fail you now\n\n\n\nBut I'll never buy\n\n\n\nI woke up with nothing left\n\nBut an empty look and bitter taste\n\nMy line of good judgement just happened to change\n\nThat last chance of freedom just suddenly played\n\n\n\nWell I never meant you torture\n\nBut I didn't care that much\n\n\n\nI'll go find my pescetarian\n\nFor who are you to doubt\n\nWon't leave a note or steal the cat\n\nAnd shoes don't fail me now\n\n\n\nI'll never buy your bad advice\n\nSo full of life and bad and bad\n\n\n\nWho are you, ya little devil \n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\nWho are you, ya little devil\n\n\n\nI'll never buy your bad advice\n\nSo full of life and bad advice\n\nI'll never buy your bad advice\n\nSo full of life and bad and bad"
