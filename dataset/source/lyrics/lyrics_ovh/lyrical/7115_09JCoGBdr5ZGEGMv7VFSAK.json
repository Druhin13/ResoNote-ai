  "lyrics": "The seasons are changing\r\nBut my world always stays the same\r\nChildren laugh behind my back\r\nThey’re younger everytime\r\nAll my friends are having kids\n\nBut nobody’s sure why\n\nI guess they’ll procreate until they die\n\n\n\nEveryone is boring\n\nEverything is lame\n\nEverybody think they’re not the same\n\nSo why don’t we get boring?\n\nLet’s get old and lame\n\nLet’s get a house and kids and change your name\n\n\n\nI’m torn on the inside\n\nA little ashamed to say\n\nThe house out in the suburbs calls my name\n\n\n\nI’m not insane but maybe I should be\n\nIt would explain some things\n\nI ‘Web-MD’ed myself but somehow nothing’s ever wrong\n\n\n\nEveryone is boring\n\nEverything is lame\n\nEverybody think they’re not the same\n\nSo why don’t we get boring?\n\nLet’s get old and lame\n\nLet’s get a house and kids and change your name\n\n\n\nWow, it’s really bringing me down\n\nThat the house with the picket fence is calling out\n\nOh, I’d rather rot in hell\n\nThan watch you become someone lame with someone else\n\nThat’d really bring me down\n\nThat’d really bring me down\n\n\n\nLet’s get old and boring\n\nLet’s both become lame\n\nGet a house and kids and change your name\n\n‘Cause I don’t think you’re boring\n\nI don’t think you’re lame\n\nLet’s get a house in summer up in Maine\n\n\n\nLet’s get old and boring\n\n\n\nLet’s both become lame\n\n\n\nWe could be so boring\n\n\n\nLet’s get a house and kids and change your name"
