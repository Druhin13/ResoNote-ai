  "lyrics": "I couldn’t care less if the world’s gone mad\r\nI couldn’t care less, wouldn’t turn my head\r\nI couldn’t care less, I couldn’t care less\r\nThe heart of the soul is not untouchable\r\nHard to hold on to what’s beautiful\r\nThere is no control, no control\n\nWhen you talk about us, can you feel the fire in us\n\nDo you ever miss?\n\nYou would never miss\n\nThrough the darkness I swear, I can see your love in there\n\nYou never miss, you never miss\n\n\n\nAnd I got a lesson learned, It’s a lesson learned\n\nOur love lives in a world of hurt\n\nIt’s a lesson learned and I feel burn\n\nOur love lives in a world of hurt\n\nOur love lives in a world of hurt\n\nOur love lives in a world of hurt\n\n\n\nI couldn’t care less by the reasons why\n\nI couldn’t care less if it’s wrong or wise\n\nI couldn’t care less\n\nI couldn’t care less\n\nI wouldn’t be here if it all made sense\n\nThought if I could only understand\n\nIt would hurt less\n\nIt would hurt less\n\nWhen you talk about us\n\nCan you feel the fire in us\n\nDo you ever miss?\n\nYou never miss\n\nThrough the darkness I swear\n\nI can see your love in there\n\nYou never miss\n\nYou never miss\n\n\n\nAnd I got a lesson learned, It’s a lesson learned\n\nOur love lives in a world of hurt\n\nIt’s a lesson learned, and I feel burn\n\nOur love lives in a world of hurt\n\n\n\nDon’t wanna lead a heartless life\n\nDon’t wanna feel numb inside\n\nDon’t wanna lead\n\nDon’t wanna lead\n\nDon’t wanna lead a heartless life\n\n\n\nIt’s a lesson learned, it’s a lesson learned\n\nLove is in a world of hurt\n\nHurt\n\nOur love is in a world of hurt…..hurt\n\nOur love is in a world of hurt"
