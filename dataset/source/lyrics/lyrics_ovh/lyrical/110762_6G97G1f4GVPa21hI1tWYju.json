  "lyrics": "There is a house in New Orleans\r\nThey call the Rising Sun\r\nAnd it's been the ruin of many poor souls\r\nAnd lord, my father is the one\r\nMy mother, she's a tailor\n\nShe sews those blue blue jeans\n\nKeep my gambling father drunk\n\nDeep down in New Orleans\n\n\n\nIt's a happy, happy, happy, happy, fun day, day\n\n\n\nLike a bird flying over forest fire\n\nMy father feels the heat beneath his wings\n\nAnd in debt he yields for another tower\n\nWhere he gambles and drunk he still drinks\n\n\n\nMy mother hides from pleasure\n\nSees the father on her knees\n\nLeft it in the arms of God\n\nAway from New Orleans\n\n\n\nHappy, happy, happy, happy, fun day, day\n\nHappy, happy, happy, happy, fun day, day"
