  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Exile Amongst the Ruins par Primordial\r\nThe old enemies are dead and long gone, my friend\nYou are like the boy who cried wolf\nA voice buried in another decade's fears\n\nAnd those songs you sang, to what end?\n\nWe are the ghosts among the ruins\nWithout history, without nation\nAnd without names\n\nHow you silenced with joy the words of noble men\nTear down the statues and burn the books\nStrike their deeds from history\nAnd turn the clocks to nought\nAnd let year zero begin on my watch\n\n\nWe are the ghosts among the ruins\nWithout history, without nation\nAnd without names\n\nRemember when I said war was coming?\nYou hear the engines grinding fast\nExpress growing louder\nWe are grinding louder\n\nPray for me\nYou pray on your deathbed\nYou pray for me\n\nWe are exiled among the ruins\nAnd we are ghosts among the ruins\nWithout history, without nations\nWithout names, without a future\n\n\nWe are the ghosts among the ruins\nWithout history, without a future"
