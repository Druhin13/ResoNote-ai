  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lights par Dabin\r\nI'm not sure why\nRunning away, running away now\nFeels right with you\n'Cause God knows we tried\nNumbing the pain, hiding away now\nSo I'll play pretend with you\n\n'Cause some nights I can't explain\nThe way I feel, the way I'm wired\nYou make things seem so clear\nSo we can leave the lights low\n\nAnd you're sick of questioning\nThe wait that comes with every hour\nBut in the night with you it's clear\nSo we can leave the lights low\n\n\nSo we can leave the lights low\nSo we can leave the lights low\n\nStreet lights did glow\nKeeping the time, keeping the time now\nAnd this feels like home\n'Cause we're both tired of feeling nothing\nDone wandering around with our feet on the ground, yeah\nIf I just keep close to you\n\n'Cause some nights I can't explain\nThe way I feel, the way I'm wired\nYou make things seem so clear\nSo we can leave the lights low\n\nAnd you're sick of questioning\n\nThe wait that comes with every hour\nBut in the night with you it's clear\n\nSo we can leave the lights low\nYeah we can leave the lights low\n\n'Cause some nights I can't explain\nThe way I feel, the way I'm wired\nYou make things seem so clear\n\nAnd you're sick of questioning\nThe wait that comes with every hour\nBut in the night with you it's clear\nSo we can leave the lights low"
