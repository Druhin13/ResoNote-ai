  "lyrics": "You never cry like a lover should \nSigh when it feels real good \nOr see the sky through the stone and wood \nYou never cry like a lover \n\n\nI thought I saw somebody I loved \n\nSleeping deep inside you \n\nIf I could catch you in an unguarded moment \n\nI'd stay right here beside you \n\n\n\nYou never smile at me late at night \n\nLaugh out loud when we get it right \n\nYou can't get loose if there's too much light \n\nYou never smile like a lover \n\n\n\nI can't live with you baby, can't live without it \n\nAnd sometimes I believe in love \n\nSometimes I doubt it \n\nBut your life goes on \n\nLike a broken down carousel \n\nWhere somebody left the music on \n\n\n\nYou never move like you used to do \n\nPour it out when you're feelin' blue \n\nSomebody must have put some pain on you \n\nYou never cry like a lover \n\n(You never Cry Like a Lover) \n\nCry \n\n(You never cry like a lover) \n\nYou never cry \n\n(Cry like a lover) \n\nCome on and cry \n\n(You never cry like a lover) \n\n\n\nLead Vocal: Don Henley"
