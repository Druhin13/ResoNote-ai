  "lyrics": "When I'm sitting all alone I can focus the best\r\nAlways short of breath from the smoke in my chest\r\nCame a long way from being broke and depressed\r\nLately life got me feeling hopeful and blessed\r\nBeen doing pretty good but it ain't goin' to my head\r\nInvesting in the future I ain't blowing any bread\n\nMotherfucker, I ain't even owing any debt\n\nThey ain't fucking with me cause they know that I'm a threat\n\nSelf made, that means, nobody the boss of me\n\nLife's short, make it count, live by that philosophy\n\nI been stacking up and I'm about to buy some property\n\nSomewhere far away from here where nobody could bother me\n\nSmoking on this kush got me trapped in a thought\n\nHackin a grot, yo this shit happens a lot\n\nThey only want the ripper, they ain't askin for Scott\n\nI could keep it chill or I could snap on the spot\n\nWhile you sitting there hating, I'm devising a plan\n\nIf you ain't moving with the tide, you gonna die in the sand\n\nTook a couple years to realize who I am\n\nI've been studying and this could be my final exam\n\nMan I can't fix the past 'cause the damage is done\n\nToo many sides of me I never planned to become\n\nBeen desensitized, I been stranded and numb\n\nNow I'm just trying to be a better man for my son\n\n\n\nIf you want to know where I stand\n\nI'm just doing all that I can\n\nTo provide a better life for my fam\n\nMan I'm good\n\nIf the drama's all your're about\n\nAin't nothing honest out of your mouth\n\nYou could keep all that for yourself\n\nCause I'm good\n\nHold me back and I'll break free\n\nWith all the strength that it takes me\n\nShit is looking up for me lately\n\nI'm good\n\nMy shoulders carrying weight\n\nI got so much shit on my plate\n\nBut, I ain't losing no faith\n\nYeah I'm good\n\n\n\nLet me break it down. This is real as it gets\n\nSmoke a little weed how I deal with the stress\n\nI been down and out but now I'm healing I guess\n\nAlways try to find a way to keep my feelings suppressed\n\nI been at it so long I ain't losing my passion\n\nBeen dealing with more shit than you could imagine\n\nFuck what they say, I ain't doin' what they asking\n\nFive in the morning and music is blasting\n\nAlways keep it honest I ain't talking no lies\n\nRight now I'm only focusing on positive vibes\n\nSo I turn the fucking beat up when I hop in the ride\n\nSeem like people all around me fucking dropping like flies\n\nYeah, you know what we call that? Cause and effect\n\nOnly want to be your friend when you deposit a check\n\nYou never get it back, once you lost my respect\n\nSo I put two middle fingers up calm and collect\n\n'Cause the show goes on\n\nFeelin' untouchable 'cause I grown so strong\n\nGetting too comfortable, that's where most go wrong\n\nYou could left behind if you don't hold on\n\nWith your hopes all gone\n\nAll the, knowledge I got, might be worthless\n\nSo I'm, pulling the shit out when I write these verses\n\nNever knew where I was headed kind of like the circus\n\nBut now, I'm feeling like my fucking life has purpose\n\n\n\nIf you want to know where I stand\n\nI'm just doing all that I can\n\nTo provide a better life for my fam\n\nMan I'm good\n\nIf the drama's all your're about\n\nAin't nothing honest out of your mouth\n\nYou could keep all that for yourself\n\nCause I'm good\n\nHold me back and I'll break free\n\nWith all the strength that it takes me\n\nShit is looking up for me lately\n\nI'm good\n\nMy shoulders carrying weight\n\nI got so much shit on my plate\n\nBut, I ain't losing no faith\n\nYeah I'm good"
