  "lyrics": "Oh my Daddy’s from Memphis\r\nHe used to hunt in Arkansas\r\nAnd then he moved to New York City\r\nThat’s where he met my Mom\r\nHe wrote his Mom & Dad a letter:\n\n“I’ll be a millionaire by twenty-five”\n\nI don’t know which one of us dreams bigger\n\nI have his heart & drive\n\n\n\nAnd he always told me and my sisters\n\nWhen we were scared to bait a hook\n\nGirls you don’t want to be no city slickers\n\nSo I’m a country girl:\n\nI love the trees and the flowers\n\nAnd those well-spent hours\n\nStaring up at the stars\n\nOh I’m a country girl\n\nThough I live in the city\n\nAnd those lights are so pretty\n\nBut I’d happily rather be\n\nSitting on the porch picking my guitar\n\n\n\nOh my Grandma was a lady\n\nShe always wore dress suits and pearls\n\nOur favorite treat was ladyfingers\n\nAnd I have her curls\n\nAnd my Mama’s from Australia\n\nAnd she grew up without a Dad\n\nAnd so she raised a home\n\nThat gave us what she never had\n\n\n\nAnd on the farm where I spent my childhood\n\nRiding horses and writing songs\n\nI’m still that child\n\n& That’s still where I belong\n\n\n\n‘Cause I’m a country girl:\n\nI love the trees and the flowers\n\nThose well-spent hours\n\nStaring up at the stars\n\nOh I’m a country girl\n\nThough I live in the city\n\nAnd those lights sure are pretty\n\nBut I’d happily rather be\n\nSitting on the porch picking my guitar\n\n\n\nBut I’d happily, rather be\n\nSitting on the porch picking on my guitar"
