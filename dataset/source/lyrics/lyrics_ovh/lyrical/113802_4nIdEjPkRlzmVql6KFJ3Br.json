  "lyrics": "How far have we fallen, how far can we go?\r\nHow far will we fall, if there's nothing below\r\nYou stand on a rock, suspended in air\r\nEmblazoned with sunlight keenly aware\r\nThat we've broken free, something has changed\r\nA tear in the fabric, some tiles rearranged\n\n\n\nWe are the no men in no man's land\n\nWe are the no men in no man's land\n\nDarkness the one thing we all understand\n\nWe are the no men in no man's land\n\nWe are the no men in no man's land\n\n\n\nAnd the truth will rise above, and fiction fall beneath\n\nAlthough the lies may bite, the truth has all the teeth\n\nYou see us as a window, you're happy that we're here\n\nExposed to all the elements, while inside all is clear\n\n\n\nBut if you hold a mirror, and you turn it to one side\n\nThe depth you see within at first, will find a place to hide\n\nWe are the no men in no man's land\n\n\n\nThe loss of all motion, the absence of sound\n\nWhen there's no sun to circle around\n\nWe are the no men in no man's land"
