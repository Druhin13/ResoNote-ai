  "lyrics": "Do you remember when we met\r\nThe first thing that you said\r\n\"I'm done with men\r\nThey all let me down\"\r\nWe built an island in the flood\n\nFound the highest ground we could\n\nSpent years in love\n\nWe're done with that now\n\n\n\nSometimes the good can go forever\n\nSometimes you fight to stay together\n\nSometimes the things that used to save you\n\nDon't anymore\n\n\n\nSo, let's get drunk and stay out all night.\n\nLet's get high as the stars, as close as shadows.\n\nOne round of coffee and one last goodbye\n\nYou and I, we're gonna see the sunrise\n\nIt's just gonna be from different beds next time\n\n\n\nWe took your brothers cadillac\n\nDrove til we ran out of gas\n\nThen we hitchiked back\n\nFrom brooklyn to queens\n\n\n\nHe said he almost called the cops\n\nHe was pissed at you for months\n\nWe just laughed until\n\nWe both couldn't breathe\n\n\n\nSo sure nobody could touch us\n\nSo sure we'd show 'em all what love was\n\nSo sure we'd always be enough\n\nI guess we were wrong\n\n\n\nSometimes the things you love don't love you back"
