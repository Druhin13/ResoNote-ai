  "lyrics": "The snow is snowing and the wind is blowing\rBut I can weather the storm!\rWhat do I care how much it may storm?\rFor I've got my love to keep me warm\rI can't remember a worse December\rJust watch those icicles form!\rOh, what do I care if icicles form?\rOh, I've got my love to keep me warm\rOff with my overcoat, off with my glove\rI need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!\rMy heart's on fire, the flame grows higher\rSo I will weather the storm!\rWhat do I care how much it may storm?\rOh, I've got my love to keep me warm\rThe snow is snowing, the wind is blowing\rBut I can weather the storm!\rWhat do I care how much it may storm?\rOh, I've got my love to keep me warm\rI can't remember a worse December\rJust watch those icicles form!\rWhat do I care if icicles form?\rOh-ho-ho, I've got my love to keep me warm\rOff with my overcoat, off with my glove\rI need no overcoat, I'm burning with love!\rMy heart's on fire, the flame grows higher\rSo I will weather the storm!\rWhat do I care how much it may storm?\rOh, I've got my love to keep me warm"
