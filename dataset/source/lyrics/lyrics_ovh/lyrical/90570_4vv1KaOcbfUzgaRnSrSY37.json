  "lyrics": "That late night goodnight call when you had too much to drink\r\nThat skinny dip in the moonlight, that magic summertime thing\r\nThat highway I've been drivin', wanna feel every curve\r\nThat taste of whiskey when you wanna kiss me\r\nBut you don't have enough\n\nWanna be, wanna be there for you\n\nIf you want, if you really want me to\n\n\n\nI'll be there, head rush, little too much\n\nMoonshine buzz, party crashin', Appalachian honey\n\nI'll be that song you wanna sing\n\nLike you're seventeen, wilder\n\nAll you gotta do is call me\n\n\n\nGonna be there\n\nWanna be there for you\n\nGonna be there\n\n\n\nLast thing, all I need, I'm filling in the color of a new tattoo\n\nThat Roman candle that you're holdin', shootin' red white and blue\n\nThat full moon halfway there when you're barefoot in the grass\n\nSayin' oh babe, let's it slow babe\n\n\n\nBut your heart beats too fast\n\nWanna be, wanna be there for you\n\nIf you want, if you really want me to\n\n\n\nI'll be there, head rush, little too much\n\nMoonshine buzz, party crashin', Appalachian honey\n\nI'll be that song you wanna sing\n\nLike you're seventeen, wilder\n\nAll you gotta do is call me\n\nI'll be that song you wanna sing\n\n\n\nLike you're seventeen, all you gotta do is call me\n\n\n\nI'll be there, head rush, little too much\n\nMoonshine buzz, party crashin', Appalachian honey\n\nI'll be that song you wanna sing\n\nLike you're seventeen, wilder\n\nAll you gotta do is call me\n\n\n\nThat feelin' that you get\n\nWhen you're runnin' out of breath so fast\n\nAll you gotta do is call me\n\nI'll be that song you wanna sing\n\nLike you're seventeen, all you gotta do is call me\n\n\n\nWanna be, wanna be there for you baby\n\nIf you want, if you want, you want me to\n\nWanna be, wanna be there for you\n\nIf you want, if you really want me to"
