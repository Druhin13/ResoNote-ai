  "lyrics": "One more kiss could be the best thing\r\nBut one more lie could be the worst\r\nAnd all these thoughts are never resting\r\nAnd you're not something I deserve\r\nIn my head there's only you now\n\nThis world falls on me\n\nIn this world there's real and make believe\n\nAnd this seems real to me\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou love me but you don't know who I am\n\nI'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand\n\nAnd you love me but you don't know who I am\n\nSo let me go \n\nLet me go\n\n\n\nI dream ahead to what I hope for\n\nAnd I turn my back on loving you\n\nHow can this love be a good thing\n\nWhen I know what I'm goin through\n\n\n\nIn my head there's only you now\n\nThis world falls on me\n\nIn this world there's real and make believe\n\nAnd this seems real to me\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou love me but you don't know who I am\n\nI'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand\n\nYou love me but you don't know who I am\n\nSo let me go \n\nJust Let me goo...\n\nLet me go\n\n\n\nAnd no matter how hard I try \n\nI can't escape these things inside I know \n\nI knowww..\n\nWhen all the pieces fall apart \n\nYou will be the only one who knows\n\nWho knows\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nYou love me but you don't know who I am\n\nI'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand\n\nAnd you love me but you don't know Who I am\n\nSo let me go \n\nJust let me go\n\n\n\nAnd you love me but you don't\n\nYou love me but you don't\n\nYou love me but you don't know who I am\n\nAnd you love me but you don't\n\nYou love me but you don't\n\nYou love me but you don't know me"
