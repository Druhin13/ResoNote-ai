  "lyrics": "I remember way back, late night, throwback\r\nSitting on the front lawn talking\r\nWhen I lost it, oh, I lost it\r\nI remember you were saying you would come back, come back\r\nFind me on the front porch like that\r\nBut you waited, so I got wasted\n\n\n\nAnd I’ve always said\n\nI'd never let myself hold on this low\n\n\n\nPeople change overnight\n\nThings get strange, but I'm alright\n\nI'm still here, and I'm still high\n\nAnd I'll still meet you in the middle of the night\n\nBut if you lie to me, lie to me\n\nLie to me\n\nI’m gone\n\n\n\nI still wonder if I called you, what would I do?\n\nLeaving too long voicemail that I hate and then erase it\n\nLike I planned it\n\nAnd I wonder if I still lived in the city\n\nWould I see you at a party, take a big sip of my whiskey and I'll leave quickly\n\nI pray you miss me\n\n\n\nAnd I still know exactly how this ends\n\nI keep holding on\n\n\n\n‘Cause people change overnight\n\nThings get strange, but I'm alright\n\nI'm still here, and I'm still high\n\nAnd I'll still meet you in the middle of the night\n\nYou know, I'll meet you in the middle of the night\n\nBut if you lie to me\n\nI’m gone\n\n\n\nOh, I feel it in me\n\nPlease forgive me\n\nLeave this memory\n\nDon't say you miss me\n\nI know it's still in me\n\nPlease forgive me\n\nLeave this memory\n\nDon't say you miss me\n\n\n\n'Cause people change overnight\n\nThings get strange, but I'm alright\n\nI'm still here, and I must still be high\n\n'Cause I'll still meet you in the middle of the night\n\nBut if you lie to me, lie to me\n\nChange overnight\n\nThings get strange, but I'm alright\n\nI'm still here, and I must still be high\n\nBut I'll still meet you in the middle of the night\n\nOh, if you meet me in the middle of the night\n\nYou know, I’ll meet you in the middle of the night\n\nBut if you lie to me, lie to me\n\nThen lie to me\n\nI’m gone"
