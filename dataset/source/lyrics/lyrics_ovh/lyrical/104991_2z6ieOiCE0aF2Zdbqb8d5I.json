  "lyrics": "I was still awake at dawn\r\nWhen a little spotted fawn\r\n(A little cloud of steam in the morning mist)\r\nCame across the lawn\r\nAnd I'd been late and long\r\nAnd I had waited all night long for this\n\n\n\nIf you'd have seen me last year I'd have said\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\"\n\n\n\nSo Rumi said it best: it's best to let it rest\n\nDo it like them Romans do, I guess\n\nYou try and keep em fed, you try and keep your head\n\nYou try and keep your robes out of that mess\n\n\n\nIf you'd have seen me last year I'd have said\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe made a sound like fire\n\nThrough telephonic wires\n\nAnd I had waited all night long for this\n\nWas humming soft and low\n\nWas come to let me know\n\nThat I had waited all my life on this\n\n\n\nIf you'd have seen me last year I'd have said\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\"\n\nIf you'd have seen me last year I'd have said\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\"\n\nIf you'd have seen me last year honey\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\"\n\nIf you'd have found me last year honey\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\"\n\nIf you'd have told me Nashville I'd have said\n\n\"I can't even see you there from here\""
