  "lyrics": "Now I've heard there was a secret chord \nThat David played, and it pleased the Lord \nBut you don't really care for music, do you? \nIt goes like this \nThe fourth, the fifth \nThe minor fall, the major lift \n\nThe baffled king composing Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah \n\nHallelujah \n\nHallelujah \n\nHallelujah \n\n\n\nYour faith was strong but you needed proof \n\nYou saw her bathing on the roof \n\nHer beauty and the moonlight overthrew her \n\nShe tied you \n\nTo a kitchen chair \n\nShe broke your throne, and she cut your hair \n\nAnd from your lips she drew the Hallelujah \n\n\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\n\n\nYou say I took the name in vain \n\nI don't even know the name \n\nBut if I did, well really, what's it to you? \n\nThere's a blaze of light \n\nIn every word \n\nIt doesn't matter which you heard \n\nThe holy or the broken Hallelujah \n\n\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\n\n\nI did my best, it wasn't much \n\nI couldn't feel, so I tried to touch \n\nI've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you \n\nAnd even though \n\nIt all went wrong \n\nI'll stand before the Lord of Song \n\nWith nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah \n\n\n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah, Hallelujah \n\nHallelujah"
