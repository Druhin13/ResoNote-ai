  "lyrics": "No one to tell us where to run\r\nThe day the people of earth got jealous of the sun\r\nLooked up in the sky, filled the air with gas\r\nLit a match\r\nSo how the fuck I'm supposed to write a rhyme\n\nWhen we're living in the darkest times we'll probably ever see?\n\nAnd I don't mean that as hyperbole\n\nYou look around and it's unnerving, it's disturbing\n\nWhile the earth is burning to a third degree\n\nDeadly water on the rise because of burning seas\n\nBut no emergency, just the emergence of the anti-science\n\nMagnify it while the ants die frying\n\nBut we can't die trying, 'cause the rich control the wars\n\nWith tomcats high flying\n\nBombs blast, crying moms ask why kids keep dying\n\nMight just take one for the team and throat slit these tyrants\n\nI mean, these the people supposed to give me guidance?\n\nHiding billions of dollars in Caribbean islands\n\nTelling us that we should better ourselves\n\nStand for the flag where veterans fell\n\nAnd sit there silent, come on\n\n\n\nFuck that, they want war, give 'em war, where the guns at?\n\nThey want more, give 'em more, where the funds at?\n\nThey got the power, we got the numbers\n\nLive by it, then you die by the sword\n\n\n\nFuck that, they want war, give 'em war, where the guns at?\n\nThey want more, give 'em more, where the funds at?\n\nThey got the power, we got the numbers\n\nLive by it, then you die by the sword\n\n\n\nNo one to tell us where to run\n\nThe day the people of earth got jealous of the sun\n\nLooked up in the sky, filled the air with gas\n\nLit a match\n\n\n\nHe's busy watching all his morning shows\n\nTwitter storming in a shortened prose\n\nOrange fingers, stubby orange toes\n\nPerforming for adoring droves\n\nOf baskets of deplorables\n\nTo whom accordingly our story goes\n\nHistory's just rewarding those\n\nFor the whom the bells of victory tolls\n\nSo therefore as history shows\n\nRecorded and reported so\n\nAs alternative truth, undistorted oath\n\nBackwards the pages of history goes\n\nSend a warning to our foreign foes\n\nThose torn by war and born by deported homes\n\nThey're marching forward with their morbid poem\n\nAnd pledge allegiance to that orange throne\n\nRed Pill should have taken the blue\n\nMake no mistake where Chris Orrick's home\n\n\n\nFuck that, they want war, give 'em war, where the guns at?\n\nThey want more, give 'em more, where the funds at?\n\nThey got the power, we got the numbers\n\nLive by it, then you die by the sword\n\n\n\nFuck that, they want war, give 'em war, where the guns at?\n\nThey want more, give 'em more, where the funds at?\n\nThey got the power, we got the numbers\n\nLive by it, then you die by the sword\n\n\n\nAnd there's no one to tell us where to run\n\nThe day the people of earth got jealous of the sun\n\nLooked up in the sky, filled the air with gas\n\nLit a match\n\nSaid \"We are not to be outdone!\"\n\nAnd every smile turned to char\n\nEvery rapist, every killer, every child was a star\n\nNo one could tell us where to run\n\nThe day the people of earth got jealous of the sun"
