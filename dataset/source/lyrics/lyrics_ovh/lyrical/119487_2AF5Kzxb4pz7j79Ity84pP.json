  "lyrics": "The first time I tasted somebody else’s spit, I had a coughing fit\r\nI mistakenly called them by your name\r\nI was let down, it wasn’t the same\r\nI’m doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind\r\nRegaining my self-worth in record time\r\nBut I can’t help but think of your other in the bed that was mine\n\nAm I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth\n\nCall you a bitch and leave?\n\nWhy did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?\n\nWhat was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?\n\n\n\nI feel no need to forgive but I might as well\n\nBut let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt\n\nPay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down\n\nWalk for hours in the dark feeling all hell\n\n\n\nDon’t hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best\n\nYou don’t deserve what you don’t respect\n\nDon’t deserve what you say you love and then neglect\n\nNow bite your tongue, it’s too dangerous to fall so young\n\nTake back what you said\n\nCan’t lose what you never had\n\n\n\nI feel no need to forgive but I might as well\n\nBut let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt\n\nPay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down\n\nWalk for hours in the dark feeling all hell\n\n\n\nYou got a 9 to 5, so I’ll take the night shift\n\nAnd I’ll never see you again if I can help it\n\nIn five years I hope the songs feel like covers\n\nDedicated to new lovers\n\n\n\nYou got a 9 to 5, so I’ll take the night shift\n\nAnd I’ll never see you again if I can help it\n\nIn five years I hope the songs feel like covers\n\nDedicated to new lovers\n\n\n\nYou got a 9 to 5, so I’ll take the night shift\n\nAnd I’ll never see you again if I can help it\n\nIn five years I hope the songs feel like covers\n\nDedicated to new lovers"
