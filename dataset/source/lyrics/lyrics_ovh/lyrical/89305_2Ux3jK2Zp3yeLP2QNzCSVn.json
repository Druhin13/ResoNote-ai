  "lyrics": "Elevator, operator\r\nLooks at me and smiles that weary smile\r\nI'm sure my looks could easily deceive\r\nThe very wisest of them all\r\nAnd he says,\r\n\"Are you goin' to the penthouse\n\nOr the condo that lies just beyond\n\nThe chapel door?\"\n\nI smile back and softly tell him, \"No,\n\nI'm headed to the bottom\"\n\n\n\nI'm goin' all the way down\n\nTo the bottom\n\nSo turn the music up real high\n\nAnd let the sweetest Bénédictine liqueur flow\n\nNo need to worry\n\nAbout tomorrow, 'cause you're not there\n\nI'm goin' all the way down\n\nTo the bottom\n\n\n\nRainy streets and wet memories\n\nHave found a place inside to pass the time\n\nAnd Pete serves up my whiskey cold\n\nAnd I drink it, and pray the picture fades\n\nDressed in black, you turned your back\n\nAnd broke a heart that loved and loved you so\n\nOh I loved you so\n\nThe bells rang on the day we died\n\nAnd I headed straight to the bottom\n\n\n\nI'm goin' all the way down\n\nTo the bottom\n\nSo turn the music up real high\n\nAnd let the sweetest Bénédictine liqueur flow\n\nThere's no need to worry\n\nAbout tomorrow, 'cause you're not there\n\nI'm goin' all the way down\n\nTo the very bottom\n\nI'm goin' all the way down\n\nAll the way down\n\nTo the bottom"
