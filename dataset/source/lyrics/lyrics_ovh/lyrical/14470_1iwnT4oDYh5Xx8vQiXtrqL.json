  "lyrics": "You can make somethin' out of nothin', my friend\r\nMake yourself a little bit of money to spend\r\nYou can sing your song everybody knows\r\nYou can walk in with the skinniest girl\r\nYou can carve your initials all over the world\n\nPut on your best big rock-n-roll pose\n\n\n\nWhat are you? Some kind of hero, doin' everything that you can?\n\nYou think that everybody's watchin', but nobody gives a damn\n\nNobody gives a damn\n\n\n\nYou can walk a wire and you don't need a mitt\n\nOh, the best damn thing that they haven't seen yet\n\nGive 'em a chance to fall in love with you\n\n\n\nYou can sing a tune to a million or two\n\nHave your name at the top of the list of who's-who\n\nIt don't mean nothin' when the rent is due\n\n\n\nWhat are you? Some kind of hero, doin' everything that you can?\n\nYou think that everybody's watchin', but nobody gives a damn\n\nNobody gives a damn\n\nNobody gives a damn\n\n\n\nNobody cares what you do or say\n\nThey'll forget about you anyway\n\nDon't you worry, it's a waste of time\n\nTake your number and get back in line\n\n\n\nWhat are you? Some kind of hero, doin' everything that you can?\n\nYou think that everybody's love you, but nobody gives a damn\n\nNobody gives a damn\n\nNobody gives a damn\n\nNobody gives a damn"
