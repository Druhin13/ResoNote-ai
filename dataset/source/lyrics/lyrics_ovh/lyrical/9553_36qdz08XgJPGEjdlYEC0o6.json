  "lyrics": "Probably gonna lose it, lose my mind\r\nFeels like I'm running out of time\r\nYeah, I know you know you told me so\r\nA thousand times or more\r\nBut the stones you roll\n\nThey laid me low, now I'm out the door\n\n\n\nThrow my heart out the window again!\n\nI don't think Heaven will take us in!\n\nTake my pride, sell it all to your friends\n\nA bottle of whiskey and it's quitting time again\n\n\n\nLost in the Valley? Waiting on the sun?\n\nSeven long years, tomorrow never comes!\n\nYeah I know you know\n\nYou told me so a thousand times or more\n\nBut the stones you roll, they laid me low\n\nNow I'm out the door!\n\n\n\nThrow my heart out the window again\n\nI don't think Heaven will take us in\n\nTake my pride, sell it all to your friends!\n\nA bottle of whiskey and it's quittin time again!\n\n\n\nAin't gonna turn out that way\n\nWorking for you 'til my dying day\n\n\n\nThrow my heart out the window again\n\nI don't think Heaven will take us in\n\nTake my pride, sell it all to your friends\n\nA bottle of whiskey and it's quitting time again\n\nIt's quitting time again!"
