  "lyrics": "When I wake in the night and I'm reaching for you\r\nThere's a place in my dreams where you're still in the room\r\nYou were next to me somehow\r\nThere are times when I sleep on your side of the bed\r\n'Cause since you've been away that's as close as I get\r\nThought I would've learned by now\n\n\n\nMorning light\n\nEvery now and then I start to feel alright\n\nDays are going by, I know I'll heal in time\n\nNever thought I'd be scared of the dark\n\n\n\n'Cause now I only feel it when the lights go down\n\nFeel it when the lights go down\n\nOnly get that feeling when the night rolls round\n\nFeeling when the night rolls round\n\n\n\nSometimes I get drunk when I'm all by myself\n\n'Cause it helps me forget you're with somebody else\n\nBut it don't really work that well\n\nAnd the other night I walked by your place\n\nHoping by chance that I might see your face\n\nWhy did I think that would help?\n\n\n\nMorning light\n\nEvery now and then I start to feel alright\n\nDays are going by, I know I'll heal in time\n\nNever thought I'd be scared of the dark\n\n\n\n'Cause now I only feel it when the lights go down\n\nFeel it when the lights go down\n\nOnly get that feeling when the night rolls round\n\nFeeling when the night rolls round\n\n\n\nOnly get that feeling when the lights go down\n\nFeel it when the lights go down\n\nOnly get that feeling when the night rolls round\n\nFeeling when the night rolls round\n\n\n\nI'll pray for light\n\nFour in the morning start to feel alright\n\nDays are going by, I know I'll heal in time\n\nNever thought I'd be scared of the dark\n\n\n\n'Cause now I only feel it when the lights go down\n\nFeel it when the lights go down\n\nOnly get that feeling when the lights go down\n\nFeeling when the night rolls round\n\n\n\nOnly get that feeling when the lights go down\n\nFeel it when the lights go down\n\nOnly get that feeling when the lights go down\n\nFeeling when the night rolls round\n\n\n\nOnly get that feeling when the lights go down"
