  "lyrics": "I never knew\r\nThe sky could burn a hole into my empty head\r\nI never knew\r\nA smile could turn us into enemies instead\r\nOh, the never-ending bliss of moments that you missed returning back like waves for second tries at luck\r\nThe luck you didn't have back then but now that it don't matter much it's easy love and strangers acting like your oldest friends\n\n\n\nIt's just a lot, it's just a lot\n\nI wanna hold onto the innocence I got\n\nIt's just a lot, it's just a lot\n\nI wanna care for all the little things I got\n\n\n\nI should have seen\n\nThe signs, clovers starting dying in the field\n\nI shouldn't be\n\nSurprised when all the sudden all of it is real\n\nOh, I tried to write a book but I misunderstood what I had seen and so the story made no sense\n\nAnd stories all depend on whose perspective you prefer is it an I or is it her\n\nAnd does it matter in the end\n\n\n\nIt's just a lot, it's just a lot\n\nI wanna hold onto the innocence I got\n\nIt's just a lot, it's just a lot\n\nI wanna care for all the little things I got\n\n\n\nI saw a film\n\nAnd cried cause beauty has a way of crushing me\n\nI took a pill\n\nAnd sighed cause I've done things against which I believe\n\nOh, I think of you at night when my mind won't stay quiet and I've got someone sleeping peacefully at home, but peace don't reach my bones\n\nThe sadness still remains and though I sing the same refrain\n\nIt all amounts to no one knows\n\n\n\nIt's just a lot, it's just a lot\n\nI wanna hold onto the innocence I got\n\nIt's just a lot, it's just a lot\n\nI wanna care for all the little things I got\n\n\n\nYou get it right\n\nYou get it wrong\n\nIt never stops\n\nIt's just a lot"
