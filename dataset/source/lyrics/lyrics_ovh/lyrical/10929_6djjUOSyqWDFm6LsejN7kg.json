That's when the cops came\n\nThe dynamic of my whole block changed\n\nYo it's a John Stark reality, New York mentality\n\nFaded and miseducated, twenty-four years he made it\n\nNow niggas can express they selves, yo\n\nSometimes I need to be alone\n\nTurn off the MP', shut off my phone and just zone\n\nI think of home when I need to be strong\n\nWe're rolling up, no more hitting the bong\n\nIt's just different phases I'm on, when I be writing these songs\n\nYou can hear my heart sing the tales of the light that the dark bring\n\nThe dark sing pain and prosperity\n\nChopped the new shipment now I got all my equipment\n\nSo I'm plotting on some necklaces, Mercedes or the Lexus shit?\n\nYou could see it in my eyes, I got niggerish endeavors\n\nThey gon' try to hide or make it sound clever\n\nWhile the metronome tick like a fake Rolex\n\nI'm wondering who hoes next\n\nI just wanna fuck you, singing ass bitch\n\nDon't take the curve personal, I'm just not tryna work with you\n\nI'mma be stunting on all the lame niggas who pass me\n\nWhen me and Sylvie drop Ashley, it's no more being ashy, huh\n\nAnd that's my word\n\nI been fiendin' for progress as much as dollars\n\nFuck that tee, rock a collar\n\nA business man is always proper\n\nI can't listen to what they taught ya\n\nMy flow is as pure as your daughter on her way to kindergarten\n\nNow the conflicts is starting, and everybody watching\n\nPlus your desire to be poppin'\n\nCould have the illest nigga out here weighing his options\n\nWe past the days of \"Yes, y'all and\"\n\nMost of my heroes ain't balling, they falling\n\nStep behind with the law\n\nCan you [?] and still score?\n\nBut what's the higher level if your shit ain't real\n\nBut my niggas be like playing they selves to have mass appeal\n\n\n\nStyle Wars, it ain't even 'bout the bars no more\n\nNiggas just show boat, but really they got no flow\n\nMainstream sailing, gently down the stream\n\nFlopping out the waterfall, a dollar and a scheme\n\nBut what does it all mean? Let's take a dive deep way beneath the surface\n\nYou see, it's clowns in the circus and they all lack purpose\n\nOblivious to what worth is\n\nI'm serious, the brightest of 'em when it comes to spittin' verses\n\nI been sicker than your average, it's practice\n\nNowadays rap is just deadbeats and ad-libs\n\nIt's backwards, these bastards just disrespect the art that the forefathers never even passed 'em\n\nIt's blasphemy, I gotta blast 'em\n\nI see through your act, homie, can't school me on passion\n\nI'm about that action\n\nThey talk just to get a reaction\n\nMe? I stay powered up, no battery acid\n\nSheesh, haha, You feel me like\n\nSmooth flow just to get them limbs relaxing\n\nCut class just to give you these classics\n\nMy homie Chuck Strange told me shoot that actress\n\nI said I move slow just to cruise through traffic"
