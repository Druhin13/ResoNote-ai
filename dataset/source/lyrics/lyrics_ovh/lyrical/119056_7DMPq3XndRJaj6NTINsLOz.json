  "lyrics": "Blue skies but tonight it's the morning\r\nI can't get through to you\r\nI wish that a storm would come to life and tell the story\r\n'Cause no one knows where I missed my move\r\nHow am I supposed to move on if\n\nYou don't even know what's really wrong, but\n\n\n\nLet me know if there's something I can do to fix it\n\nLet me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind\n\nI can't promise you that I'd be waiting\n\nBut for you I'll leave anything behind\n\n\n\nBack and forth, cigarettes and fast talking\n\nI feel you slip away\n\nI can't understand the reasons why you say you're leaving\n\n'Cause you were so in love with me yesterday\n\n\n\nHow am I supposed to move on if\n\nYou don't even know what's really wrong, but\n\n\n\nLet me know if there's something I can do to fix it\n\nLet me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind\n\nI can't promise you that I'd be waiting\n\nBut for you I'll leave anything behind\n\nLet me know if there's something I can do to fix it\n\nLet me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind\n\nI can't promise you that I'd be waiting\n\nBut for you I'll leave anything behind\n\n\n\nLet me know if there's something I can do to fix it\n\nLet me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind\n\nI can't promise you that I'd be waiting\n\nBut for you I'll leave anything behind\n\nLet me know if there's something I can do to fix it\n\nLet me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind\n\nI can't promise you that I'd be waiting\n\nBut for you I'll leave anything behind\n\n\n\nI still love, I still love, I still love\n\nI still love, I still love, I still love\n\nI still love\n\nI still love you, I still love you, I still love you\n\nI still love you"
