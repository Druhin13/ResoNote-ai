  "lyrics": "One thing left to try\r\nSee if you can make it\r\nBefore you choose the night\r\nAnd the silence overtakes you\r\nIf you looked into the fire\r\nAnd you had that conversation\n\nThen there's one thing left to try\n\nIf you want to save your life\n\n\n\nFear is his name but his friends still call him God\n\nAgain and again the thought remains\n\n\n\n(The only way to get rid of the feeling)\n\n\n\nI don't wanna die!\n\nWishing I'd done something\n\nMore than what's required\n\nTo last until the sunset\n\nNo, I don't wanna die\n\nThinking that I'm dreaming\n\nThere's one thing left to try\n\nIf you want to change your life\n\n\n\nToday I left those thoughts behind, behind\n\nOver and over, you die just to feel alive\n\n\n\nThe only way to get rid of the feeling\n\nYou have to draw the line\n\nAnd remember there's more than you're seeing\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDo you want to keep us alive?\n\nDo you want to feel alive?\n\nDo you want to keep us alive?\n\nDo you want to feel alive?\n\n(Fun is over tonight)\n\nDo you want to keep us alive?\n\n(Fun is over tonight)\n\nDo you want to feel alive?\n\n(Fun is over tonight)\n\nDo you want to keep us alive?\n\n(Fun is over tonight)\n\nDo you want to feel alive?\n\n(Fun is over tonight)\n\n\n\n(There's one thing left to try)\n\n(There's one thing left to try)"
