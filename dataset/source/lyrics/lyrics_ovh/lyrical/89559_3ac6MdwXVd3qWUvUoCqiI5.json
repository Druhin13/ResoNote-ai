  "lyrics": "To the rhythm of a broken heart\r\nI lied, I lost the love\r\nOf my life and that’s enough\r\nSo take the part of me\r\nThe part of me that made you leave\r\nForget about that, forget about being mad\n\nI think we can get it back\n\n\n\nI've lived so long\n\nLiving like I want to be here alone\n\nHow was I so wrong?\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home\n\n\n\nI don’t mind, no\n\nGiving up, walking up to apologize\n\nI know I’m wrong, I feel it all the time\n\nYou love me too, you do\n\nThat’s why it hurts, that’s why I made you cry\n\nAnd I’m sorry I know it’s taking me a while\n\nBut maybe in a song\n\n\n\nI've lived so long\n\nLiving like I want to be here alone\n\nHow was I so wrong?\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home\n\nI've lived so long\n\nLiving like I want to be here alone\n\nHow was I so wrong?\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home\n\nTell me what it takes to get you home"
