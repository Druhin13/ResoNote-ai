Uh... What aren't I?\n\nWho's constantly in war inside? Me, myself, and my pride\n\nThey all stressin', but thoughts not restin'\n\nCuz I can't let it all fall apart like it's sections\n\nThere's aggresion, depression, hella second guessin'\n\nI'm feelin' like I'm mind blown, thoughts are at a dead end\n\nPop says correction, Mom says a revered\n\nShe know I won't listen but still she throws the suggestion\n\nI played mental Tekken so all of this is a blessin'\n\nI was lost on the road and finally found a direction\n\nFuck with anybody, think I'm lovin' the progression\n\nStill they say I'm immature like a bored freshman\n\nThey got no idea that I was really destined\n\nThey got no idea that I was really destined\n\nI continued on my path and my mind as my weapon\n\nI walked through hell, now I'm inventin' the heaven, cuz...\n\n\n\nYou ain't got no idea\n\nIf you thinkin' that this boy about to cower in fear, nah\n\nYou ain't got no idea\n\nCuz I done been through a lot in these 15 years\n\nYou ain't got no idea\n\nSaid I done been through a lot, still I ain't show tears\n\nYou ain't got no idea\n\nSaid you don't know how I see it, you don't know how I see it"
