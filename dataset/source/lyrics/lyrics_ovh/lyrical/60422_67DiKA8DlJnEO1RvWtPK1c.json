  "lyrics": "I'm holding on to familiar ghosts\r\nAnother late night sat down at the piano\r\nI'm going over conversations we had\r\nTesting out the words I never said but should have\r\nThere's a case in the kitchen ice cold\n\nThere's a slow dance in the fireplace so slow\n\nThere's the talk of how we'll be when we're old\n\nThere's the thing that we have, two puzzle piece born to be whole\n\nTwo puzzle piece born to be whole\n\n\n\nAnd on my mind it sweeps like the tide\n\nA constant in and out, one man's unwavering fight\n\nYou never did stand for my shit\n\nAnd you challenge every word even as I hold on to it\n\n\n\nThere's a smile in the mirror frame gold\n\nThere's a toothpaste grin laughing at your own jokes\n\nThere's the talk of how we'll be when we're old\n\nThere's this thing that we have, two puzzle piece born to be whole\n\nTwo puzzle piece born to be whole\n\n\n\nBut damn it there's so much I want to tell you (to tell you)\n\nBut damn it, it's so hard for me to say (to say, to say, to say)\n\nWell I've never known too much, but here's a hopeful harshing tut\n\n'Cause I would love to see you every single day\n\nEvery single day\n\n\n\nThere's locked horns and arms crossed\n\nImaginations run wild\n\nThere's a touch under table\n\nThere's impeccable style\n\n\n\nThere's red lips on balconies\n\nAnd shouting in the street\n\nThere's a kiss as the lift closed\n\nThere's a day spent in sheets\n\n\n\nThere's a cannonball firework\n\nKarmic confetti\n\nThere's a promise, a photograph\n\nEmpty seat that you kept for me\n\n\n\nI was watching you do makeup\n\nA mate for my soul\n\nSee, there's things that we have\n\nTwo puzzle piece born to be whole\n\n\n\nAnd everybody knows\n\nTwo puzzle piece born to be whole\n\n\n\nOh, ha...\n\n\n\nBut damn it there's so much I want to tell you (to tell you)\n\nBut damn it, it's so hard for me to say (to say, to say, to say)\n\nWell I've never known too much, but here's a hopeful harshing tut\n\n'Cause I would love to see you every single day\n\nEvery single day"
