  "lyrics": "His heart beats, His blood begins to flow\r\nWaking up what was dead a moment ago\r\nAnd His heart beats, now everything is changed\r\n'Cause the blood that brought us peace with God\r\nIs racing through His veins\r\nAnd His heart beats\n\nHis heart beats\n\n\n\nHe breathes in, His living lungs expand\n\nThe heavy air surrounding death turns to breath again\n\nHe breathes out, He is word and flesh once more\n\nThe Lamb of God slain for us is a Lion ready to roar\n\nAnd His heart beats\n\n\n\nSo crown Him the Lord of Life\n\nCrown Him the Lord of Love\n\nCrown Him the Lord of All\n\n\n\nHe took one breath\n\nAnd put death to death\n\nWhere is your sting, O grave?\n\nHow grave is your defeat\n\nI know, I know His heart beats\n\n\n\nHe rises, glorified in flesh\n\nClothed in immortality, the firstborn from the dead\n\nHe rises, and His work's already done\n\nSo He's resting as He rises to reclaim the Bride He won\n\nAnd His heart beats\n\n\n\nSo crown Him the Lord of Life\n\nCrown Him the Lord of Love\n\nCrown Him the Lord of All\n\n\n\nHe took one breath\n\nAnd put death to death\n\nWhere is your sting, O grave?\n\nHow grave is your defeat\n\nI know, I know His heart beats\n\n\n\nThe last enemy to be destroyed is death\n\nThe last enemy to be destroyed is death\n\nHe must reign until no enemy is left\n\nThe last enemy to be destroyed, to be destroyed is death\n\n\n\nHis heart beats, He will never die again\n\nI know that death no longer has dominion over Him\n\nSo my heart beats with the rhythm of the saints\n\nAs I look for the seeds the King has down\n\nTo burst up from their graves\n\n\n\nI know, I know\n\nHe took one breath\n\nAnd put death to death\n\nWhere is your sting, O grave?\n\nHow grave is your defeat\n\nI know, I know\n\nHe took one breath\n\nAnd put death to death\n\nWhere is your sting, O grave?\n\nHow grave is your defeat\n\nHow great, how great is His victory\n\nI know, I know His heart beats\n\nI know, I know His heart beats\n\nHis heart beats"
