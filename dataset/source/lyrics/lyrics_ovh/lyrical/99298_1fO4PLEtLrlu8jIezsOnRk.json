  "lyrics": "Cause I know you’ve got a lot on your plate\r\nAnd class after work lately\r\nAnd I know you never catch any breaks\r\nAnd I feel the same way\r\nI’m not at my best now, been feeling stressed out\n\nObsessive compulsive, pulling my hair out in bunches\n\nJust try to breathe slow, make both of your lungs full\n\nI’ll follow my heart, to be wherever you are\n\n\n\nI could just hold you here forever\n\nHold you here, I’ll never need more\n\nI’ll never need more\n\n\n\nCause I know we both have seen better days\n\nBut somehow we still made it\n\nAnd I hope the sun continues to raise\n\nLike the rent that we’re paying\n\n\n\nI’m not at my best now, been feeling stressed out\n\nI’m late on the payment, one bill from ending up bankrupt\n\nWe’ll lessen the distance stretched out in between us\n\nI’ll follow my heart to be wherever you are\n\n\n\nI could just hold you here forever\n\nHold you here, I’ll never need more\n\nI’ll never need more\n\nI could just hold you here forever\n\nHold you here, I’ll never need more\n\nI’ll never need more\n\n\n\nI’m at my worst without you, full of doubt\n\nA heavy shade of blue\n\nI’m at my best with you, I never knew\n\nWhat I was missing out\n\nCause you have me all the way\n\n\n\nI could just hold you here forever\n\nHold you here, I’ll never need more\n\nI’ll never need more\n\nI could just hold you here forever\n\nHold you here, I’ll never need more\n\nI’ll never need more"
