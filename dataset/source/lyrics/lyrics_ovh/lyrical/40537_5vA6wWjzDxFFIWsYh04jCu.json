  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Shape par Nico De Andrea\r\nHe deals the cards as a meditation\nAnd those he plays never suspect\nHe doesn't play for the money he wins\nHe don't play for respect\n\nHe deals the cards to find the answer\nThe sacred geometry of chance\nThe hidden law of a probable outcome\nThe numbers lead a dance\n\nI know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\nI know that the clubs are weapons of war\nI know that diamonds mean money for this art\nBut that's not the shape of my heart\n\n\nThe shape of my heart\n\nAnd if I told you that I loved you\nYou'd maybe think there's something wrong\nI'm not a man of too many faces\nThe mask I wear is one\n\nThose who speak know nothing\nAnd find out to their cost\nLike those who curse their luck in too many places\nAnd those who fear a loss\n\nI know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\nI know that the clubs are weapons of war\nI know that diamonds mean money for this art\nBut that's not the shape of my heart\n\n\nThe shape of my heart\n\nI know that the spades are the swords of a soldier\nI know that the clubs are weapons of war\nI know that diamonds mean money for this art\nBut that's not the shape of my heart"
