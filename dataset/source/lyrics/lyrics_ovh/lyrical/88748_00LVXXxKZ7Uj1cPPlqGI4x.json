Can I call you?\n\nWhen the radio don't play\n\nThe song to ease my pain\n\nCan I call you? (Can I call you?)\n\nCan I call you? (Can I call you?)\n\n\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\n\n\nSee, I can't change the way things are\n\nEven though it feels wrong in my heart\n\n\n\nWhen I'm driving through the night\n\nWith no strength left inside\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nWhen the radio don't play\n\nThe song to ease my pain\n\nCan I call you? (Can I call you?)\n\nCan I call you? (Can I call you?)\n\n\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\n\n\nMaybe the stars will show me something\n\nSomething I can hold on to\n\nAnd maybe the stars will show me something\n\nShine a light so I know it's you\n\n\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\n\n\nMaybe the stars will show me something\n\nSomething I can hold on to\n\nAnd maybe the stars will show me something\n\nShine a light so I know it's you\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?\n\nCan I call you? Can I call you?"
