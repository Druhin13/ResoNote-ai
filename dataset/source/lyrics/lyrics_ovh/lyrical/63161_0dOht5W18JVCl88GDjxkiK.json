  "lyrics": "1, 2, 3, 4\r\nShame, shame, shame\r\nIt ́s not the wine, and it ́s not the rain\r\nIt ́s just a feeling that I can ́t explain\n\nIf you want to get in\n\nShe said you’ve got to get out, before\n\nWhy don ́t you try to begin?\n\nCome on your life is an open door\n\nWell, I don‘t want to make you promises\n\nBut when you look at this\n\nIt ́s such a shame\n\n\n\nShame, shame, shame\n\nShe left me out here in the rain\n\nMy life will never be the same\n\n`Til she ́s back again\n\nShame, shame, shame\n\nIt ́s not the wine, and it ́s not the rain\n\nIt ́s just a feeling that I can ́t explain\n\n\n\nShe was the sweetest symphony\n\nAnd I was blind as boys can be\n\nI fell in love, and suddenly\n\nShe needed more than I could give\n\nShe spoke of time and space to live\n\nWas too much space and time for me\n\n\n\nWhen the feeling is gone\n\nAnd the skies are all grey, you know\n\nBaby try to walk on\n\nTake your life in your hands and go\n\nThe better days will come for everyone\n\nAnd you will find the sun (again)\n\n\n\nShame, shame, shame\n\nShe ́s left me out here in the rain\n\nMy life will never be the same\n\n`Til she ́s back again\n\nShame, shame, shame\n\nIt ́s not the wine, and it ́s not the rain\n\nIt ́s just a feeling that I can ́t explain\n\nShame, shame, shame\n\nGive me a puddle of champagne\n\nMy life will never be the same\n\n`Til she ́s back again\n\n\n\nIt's a feeling that I can't explain"
