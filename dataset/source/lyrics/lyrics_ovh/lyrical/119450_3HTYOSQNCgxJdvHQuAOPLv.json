  "lyrics": "In my time I've travelled some roads\r\nA rolling stone\r\nNowhere feels like home\r\nAnd I've seen people come, then they go\r\nLife is just a story of some highs and some lows\r\nTell me do you believe in miracles?\n\nI'm standing here before your eyes\n\n\n\nI've cried many rivers\n\nI've walked through some pain\n\nI've seen my world crumble\n\nAnd I've carried the shame\n\nBut I know somebody, he calls me his own\n\nI can hear heaven singing out\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\n\n\nEverybody wants to be king\n\nWe put all our hope inside material things\n\nIn your light I now understand\n\nThat everything I have and everything that I am\n\nOh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough\n\nBut that's when love says you're mine\n\n\n\nI've cried many rivers\n\nI've walked through some pain\n\nI've seen my world crumble\n\nAnd I've carried the shame\n\nBut I know somebody, he calls me his own\n\nI can hear heaven singing out\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\n\n\nI may have took some time\n\nBut now I realise\n\nMy imperfections were a part of your plan\n\nAnd if all things work together in the end\n\nThe broken world'll be beautiful\n\n\n\nThere's not a hole too deep\n\nWhere God's love is not deeper still\n\nYou've come too far to give up now\n\nLet's go!\n\n\n\nI've cried many rivers\n\nI've walked through some pain\n\nI've seen my world crumble\n\nAnd I've carried the shame\n\nBut I know somebody, he calls me his own\n\nI can hear heaven singing out\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone\n\nOh-oh-oh, you're never alone"
