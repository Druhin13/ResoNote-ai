  "lyrics": "You've got a friend in me\r\nYou've got a friend in me\r\nWhen the road looks rough ahead\r\nAnd you're miles and miles from your nice and warm bed.\r\nYou just remember what your old pal said\r\nBoy, you've got a friend in me\n\nYeah, you've got a friend in me\n\n\n\nYou've got a friend in me\n\nYou've got a friend in me\n\nYou got troubles, then I got 'em too\n\nThere isn't anything I wouldn't do for you\n\nIf we stick together we can see it through\n\n'Cause you've got a friend in me\n\nYou've got a friend in me\n\n\n\nNow some other folks might\n\nBe a little bit smarter than I am\n\nBigger and stronger too. Maybe\n\nBut none of them will ever love you\n\nThe way I do\n\nJust me and you, boy\n\n\n\nAnd as the years go by\n\nOur friendship will never die\n\nYou're gonna see, it's our destiny\n\nYou've got a friend in me\n\nYou've got a friend in me\n\nYou've got a friend in me"
