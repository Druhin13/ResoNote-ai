Wouldn't you rather get along?\n\nYou was coughin' when you hit my weed\n\nBut I've never seen you feel that free\n\nSo cute, you wanna be like me\n\nWouldn't you rather get along? Wouldn't you rather get along?\n\n\n\nUntil, until, there is no longer\n\nLet's get lost inside the clouds\n\nAnd you, you don't gotta work harder\n\nI can calm you down, yeah\n\n\n\nWell I was busy when you hit my phone\n\nBut you miss me, tell me come back home, yeah\n\nYou don't really like to sleep alone\n\nBut I'm takin' too long, I'm always takin' too long\n\nBaby we don't need a trip, we could be right here\n\nWhen the shit get weird, we could switch up gears\n\nI wanna see them lips, kiss 'em ear to ear\n\nI wanna hear your song\n\nOoh, I wanna feel just how you feel\n\nTouch it one more time so I know you're real\n\nWe could spin that wheel, wouldn't you rather get along?\n\n\n\nUntil, until, there is no longer\n\nLet's get lost inside the clouds\n\nAnd you, you don't gotta work harder\n\nI can calm you down\n\n\n\nI think we just might be alright, thank God\n\nI think we're gonna be alright, alright, okay\n\nHold me close don't hold your breath\n\nThat's really your favorite, I know"
