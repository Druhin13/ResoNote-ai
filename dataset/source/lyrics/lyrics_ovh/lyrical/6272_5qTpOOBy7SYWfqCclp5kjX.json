  "lyrics": "Well, you almost had me fooled\r\nTold me that I was nothing without you\r\nOh, and after everything you've done\r\nI can thank you for how strong I have become\r\n'Cause you brought the flames and you know it too well\n\nI had to learn how to fight for myself\n\nAnd we both know all the truth I could tell\n\nI'll just say this is I wish you farewell\n\n\n\nI hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'\n\nI hope your soul is changin', changin'\n\nI hope you find your peace\n\nFalling on your knees, prayin'\n\n\n\nI'm proud of who I am\n\nNo more monsters, I can breathe again\n\nAnd you said that I was done\n\nWell, you were wrong and now the best is yet to come\n\n\n\nYou brought the flames and you know it too well\n\nI had to learn how to fight for myself\n\nAnd we both know all the truth I could tell\n\nI'll just say this is I wish you farewell\n\n\n\nI hope you're somewhere prayin', prayin'\n\nI hope your soul is changin', changin'\n\nI hope you find your peace\n\nFalling on your knees, prayin'"
