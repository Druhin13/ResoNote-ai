  "lyrics": "People say it's nice to meet me\r\nI often wonder why\r\nI've studied my reflection\r\nI look me in the eye\r\nBut I can't still draw conclusions\r\nI'm still talkin' out of turn\n\nNow I ask too many questions\n\nAbout the lessons I will learn\n\n\n\nTurns out all my mistakes were forgivable\n\nAnd the time I spent lost was a sign\n\nThat all the ink is invisible\n\nIf you give it, give it enough time\n\n\n\nNow I think my eyes are open\n\nI take a deeper dive\n\nWhen I feel the blues around me\n\nThat's when I come alive\n\nWhen it starts to feel too lonely\n\nWhen it's out of my control\n\nWhen the world goes on without me\n\nWill I feel it take control\n\n\n\nIt turns out all my mistakes were forgivable\n\nAnd the time I spent lost was a sign\n\nThat all the ink is invisible\n\nIf you give it, give it enough time\n\nIf I give it, give it enough time\n\nJust give it time"
