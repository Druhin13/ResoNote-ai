  "lyrics": "The world has shut me out\r\nIf I give everything I'll lose everything\r\nEverything is about me\r\nI am the most important thing\r\nAnd you really haven't thought all those cyclical thoughts for a while?\n\nAnd as it keeps going\n\nI could never be involved\n\nI could never really see in real time\n\nI could never be involved\n\nAnd as it keeps on going\n\nI could avoid real time\n\nI could ignore my busy mind\n\nI could avoid contact with eyes\n\nI could avoid going outside\n\nI could avoid wasting my life\n\nI could avoid\n\nI could avoid 20/20 sight\n\nI could avoid standing in line\n\nI could avoid the 405\n\nI could avoid coming to life\n\nI could say anything I like\n\nI could switch off whenever I like\n\nI could sleep whenever I like\n\nI could leave in the middle of the night, oh\n\nBut I'd miss it\n\nDon't miss it\n\nDon't miss it like I did\n\n\n\nAnd as it keeps going\n\nIf there's no need for the perfect image\n\nAnd nothing seems that wrong\n\nDon't miss it\n\nWhen you know there's better conversation waiting for you at home\n\nAnd as it keeps on going\n\nYou forget whether it was the beginning or end\n\nWhen you can't believe your luck\n\n(When you can't believe your luck)\n\nYou're with your friend\n\nWhen you get to hang out with your favourite person every day\n\nWhen the dull pain goes away\n\nDon't miss it (Don't miss it)\n\nWhen you stop being a ghost in a shell\n\nAnd everybody keeps saying you look well\n\nDon't miss it\n\nLike I did\n\nDon't miss it\n\nDon't miss it like I did\n\nLike I did"
