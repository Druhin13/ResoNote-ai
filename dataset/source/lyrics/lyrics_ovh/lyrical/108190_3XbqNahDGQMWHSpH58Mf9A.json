  "lyrics": "City girls just seem to find out early,\r\nHow to open doors with just a smile.\r\nA rich old man, and she won't have to worry.\r\nShe'll dress up all in lace and go in style.\r\nLate at night, the big old house gets lonely.\n\nI guess every form of refuge has its price.\n\nAnd it breaks her heart, to think her love is only\n\nGiven to a man with hands as cold as ice.\n\n\n\nSo she tells him she must go out for the evening,\n\nTo comfort an old friend who's feeling down.\n\nBut he knows where she's going as she's leaving.\n\nShe's headed for the cheatin' side of town.\n\n\n\nYou can't hide your lyin' eyes.\n\nAnd your smile is a thin disguise.\n\nI thought by now, you'd realize\n\nThere ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of town, a boy is waiting,\n\nWith firey eyes and dreams no one could steal.\n\nShe drives on through the night, anticipating,\n\n'Cause he makes her feel the way she used to feel.\n\n\n\nShe rushes to his arms, they fall together.\n\nShe whispers that it's only for a while.\n\nShe swears that soon she'll be comin' back forever.\n\nShe goes away, and leaves him with a smile\n\n\n\nYou can't hide your lyin' eyes.\n\nAnd your smile is a thin disguise.\n\nI thought by now, you'd realize\n\nThere ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.\n\n\n\nShe gets up and pours herself a strong one\n\nAnd stares out at the stars up in the sky.\n\nAnother night, it's gonna be a long one.\n\nShe draws the shade and hangs her head to cry.\n\n\n\nShe wonders how it ever got this crazy.\n\nShe thinks about a boy she knew in school.\n\nDid she get tired, or did she just get lazy?\n\nShe's so far gone she feels just like a fool.\n\n\n\nMy oh my, you sure know how to arrange things\n\nYou set it up so well, so carefully.\n\nAin't it funny how your new life didn't change things?\n\nYou're still the same old girl you used to be.\n\n\n\nYou can't hide your lyin' eyes.\n\nAnd your smile is a thin disguise.\n\nI thought by now, you'd realize\n\nThere ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes.\n\n\n\nHoney, you can't hide your lyin' eyes"
