  "lyrics": "Love on the rocks ain't no surprise\r\nPour me a drink,\r\nAnd I'll tell you some lies\r\nGot nothing to lose,\r\nSo you just sing the blues, all the time\n\nGave you my heart, gave you my soul\n\nYou left me alone here\n\nWith nothing to hold\n\nYesterday's gone\n\nNow all I want is a smile\n\n\n\nFirst they say they want you\n\nHow they really need you\n\nSuddenly you find you're out there\n\nWalking in a storm\n\n\n\nWhen they know they have you\n\nThen they really have you\n\nNothing you can do or say,\n\nYou've got to leave, just get away\n\nWe all know the song\n\n\n\nYou need what you need\n\nYou can say what you want\n\nNot much you can do\n\nWhen the feeling is gone\n\nMay be blue skies above,\n\nBut it's cool\n\nWhen your love's on the rocks\n\n\n\nFirst they say they want you\n\nHow they really need you\n\nSuddenly you find you're out there\n\nWalking in a storm\n\n\n\nAnd when they know they have you\n\nThen they really have you\n\nNothing you can do or say\n\nYou got to leave, just get away\n\nWe all know the song\n\n\n\nLove on the rocks\n\nAin't no big surprise\n\nJust pour me a drink\n\nAnd I'll tell you my lies\n\nYesterday 's gone\n\nNow all I want is a smile....."
