  "lyrics": "First you're runnin' one way\r\nThen you run another\r\nThinkin' you'd discover\r\nWhat you really need\r\nRunnin' in circles\n\nGonna get you nowhere\n\nWhy you want to go there?\n\nWhere's it gonna lead?\n\n\n\nWhat's it gonna be when the night is cold?\n\nWhat's it gonna be when the morning scares you?\n\nPut your reservations all on hold\n\nClimb aboard and ride with me\n\n\n\nLonely gets you nowhere\n\nOnly gets you zero\n\nI may not be a hero\n\nBut I'm the man you need\n\n\n\nOne way or another\n\nYou need a new direction\n\nMake a new connection\n\nHey, what's it gonna be?\n\n\n\nWhat's it gonna be?\n\nDo you take a chance?\n\nAre you gonna let the night defeat you?\n\nIf you're tellin' me that you just can't dance?\n\nI say try it on and see\n\n\n\nMove a little closer\n\nTry a little harder\n\nDancing with a partner\n\nHelps you find the beat\n\n\n\nTime to put it out there\n\nBefore it's movin' past you\n\nSo once again, I'll ask you\n\nWhat's it gonna be?\n\n\n\n....\n\n\n\nWhat's it gonna be when the night is cold?\n\nWhat's it gonna be when the morning scares you?\n\nPut your reservations all on hold\n\nClimb aboard and ride with me\n\n\n\nOne way or another\n\nYou need a new direction\n\nMake a new connection\n\nSo what's it gonna be?\n\nWhat's it gonna be?\n\nWhat's it gonna be?\n\nWhat's it gonna be?\n\nWhat's it gonna be?"
