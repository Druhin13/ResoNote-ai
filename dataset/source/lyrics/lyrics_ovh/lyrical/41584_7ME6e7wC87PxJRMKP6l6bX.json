  "lyrics": "Everybody has their reasons to kill\r\nAnd mine was you, mine was you\r\nEverybody is running away\r\nI ran from you, I ran from you\r\nSo why am I the only one?\n\nYeah, why am I the only one?\n\n\n\nEverybody has their reasons to change\n\nAnd mine was you, mine was you\n\nEverybody is searching for truth\n\nAnd I found you, I found you\n\n\n\nHow can I make things right?\n\nWhen all of my thoughts come crawling back to me at night\n\nI'm trapped inside my mind\n\nWith all of the reasons that I have searched, but never find\n\n\n\nSo why am I the only one? (only one)\n\nRunning away from myself\n\nI'm running away from it all\n\nWhy am I the only one? (only one)\n\nI'm running away from myself\n\nI'm running away from it all\n\n\n\n(Why am I the only one?)\n\n(Yeah, why am I the only one?)\n\n(Why am I the only one?)\n\n(Yeah, why am I the only one?)\n\n\n\nFrom now and on\n\nI'm strong enough to reach the sky\n\n\n\nFrom now and on\n\nI'm strong enough to reach the sky\n\n\n\nFrom now and on\n\nI'm strong enough to reach the sky\n\n\n\nWhy am I the only one?\n\nI'm running away from myself\n\nI'm running away from it all\n\nWhy am I the only one?\n\nI'm running away from myself\n\nI'm running away from it all"
