  "lyrics": "Go, tell it on the mountain\r\nOver the hills and everywhere\r\nGo, tell it on the mountain\r\nThat Jesus Christ is born\r\nWhile shepherds kept their watching\n\nO'er their silent flocks night\n\nBehold throughout the heavens\n\nThere shone a holy light\n\n\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain\n\nOver the hills and everywhere\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain\n\nThat Jesus Christ is born\n\n\n\nThe shepherds feared and trembled\n\nWhen lo! Above the Earth\n\nRang out the angel chorus\n\nThat hailed our Savior's birth\n\nThat hailed our Savior's birth\n\n\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain\n\nOver the hills and everywhere\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain\n\nThat Jesus Christ is born\n\n\n\nDown in a lowly manger\n\nOur humble Christ was born\n\nAnd God sent us salvation\n\nThat blessed Christmas morn\n\nThat blessed Christmas morn\n\n\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain\n\nOver the hills and everywhere\n\nGo, tell it on the mountain\n\nThat Jesus Christ is born\n\nThat Jesus Christ is born\n\nThat Jesus Christ is born"
