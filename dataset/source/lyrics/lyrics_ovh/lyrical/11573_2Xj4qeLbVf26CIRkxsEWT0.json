  "lyrics": "In the presence of my enemies\r\nWhen the storm is crashing down on me\r\nI will trust in what I cannot see\r\nI wait for You, I wait for You\r\nYou can part the violent sea\n\nYou can reach the depths of me!\n\n\n\nI know, nothing is impossible\n\nI know, every chain is breakable\n\nI know, on Christ the solid rock I stand\n\n\n\nI am waiting at the water's edge\n\nHolding steadfast onto Your promises\n\nEven though I'm not there yet\n\nI trust in You, I trust in You\n\n\n\nYou can part the violent sea\n\nYou can reach the depths of me!\n\n\n\nI know, nothing is impossible\n\nI know, every chain is breakable\n\nI know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!\n\nMy fear, is conquered by His perfect love\n\nMy life, is ransomed by His royal blood\n\nI know, on Christ the solid rock I stand\n\n\n\nMy hope is built on nothing less\n\nThan Jesus blood and righteousness\n\nWhen darkness seems to hide His face\n\nI rest in His unchanging grace\n\nIn every high and stormy gale\n\nMy anchor holds within the veil\n\nOn Christ the solid rock I stand\n\nAll other ground is sinking sand!\n\n\n\nI know, nothing is impossible\n\nI know, every chain is breakable\n\nI know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!\n\nMy fear, is conquered by His perfect love\n\nMy life, is ransomed by His royal blood\n\nI know, on Christ the solid rock I stand!"
