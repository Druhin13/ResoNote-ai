  "lyrics": "In this house of broken hearts\r\nWe made our love out of stacks of cards\r\nAnd yes we tried, to hold on tight\r\nCause we knew our love was hard to find\r\nAnd our paper houses reach the stars\n\n'Til we break and scatter worlds apart\n\nYeah, I paid the price and own the scars\n\nWhy do we climb and fall so far?\n\n\n\nWe held our cards, built them high\n\nBut way too close to the light\n\nSo turn your head, and let us go\n\nI learned to breathe on my own\n\n\n\nAnd our paper houses reach the stars\n\n'Til we break and scatter worlds apart\n\nYeah, I paid the price and own the scars\n\nWhy do we climb and fall so far?\n\n\n\nAnd our paper houses reach the stars\n\n'Til we break and scatter worlds apart\n\nI don't wanna lose your touch\n\nI don't wanna hurt this much\n\nI can feel you slipping away\n\n\n\nYeah, I paid the price and own the scars\n\nWhy do we climb and fall so far?\n\n\n\nWhy do we climb to fall so far?"
