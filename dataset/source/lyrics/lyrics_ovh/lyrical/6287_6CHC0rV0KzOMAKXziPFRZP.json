  "lyrics": "G train on the weekend, speed up or slow down\r\nGathering gathering, get off this train or you’re gonna go back uptown\r\nG train on the weekend, there’s no way out\r\nTraveling traveling, it’s 2am and I thought I'd be home by now\r\nWhat am I doing this for?\n\nI followed you to your door\n\nI should've already known\n\nTo keep going on home\n\n\n\nLove, I gotta warn you\n\nI'm starting to catch onto\n\nWhat you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)\n\nI've been losing patience\n\nYour mind is always changing\n\nBack and forth, I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)\n\n\n\nG train on the weekend, hum and reload\n\nA lullaby for the guy who fell down nearby cause he did a bit too much blow\n\nG train on the weekend, just me and my head\n\nWondering why you deny my love when I keep on running back to your side\n\n\n\nWhat am I doing this for?\n\nI followed you to your door\n\nI should've already known\n\nTo get going on home\n\nYou told me don't take it too fast\n\nCause you got an ugly past\n\nI think I could help but you don't\n\nGuess get going on home\n\n\n\nLove, I gotta warn you\n\nStarting to catch onto\n\nWhat you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)\n\nI've been losing patience\n\nYour mind is always changing\n\nBack and forth I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)\n\n\n\nI won’t, I won't wait here\n\nI won't wait here for you (yeah)\n\nI won’t (let's talk about it), I won't wait here (King Push)\n\nI won't wait here for you to get on board (it's just a conversation)\n\n\n\nTime's ticking, I'm waiting as I'm wishing\n\nWhile you sitting on your hands as your mind's switching\n\nExpecting me to stick around while you side-picking\n\nYou can't chase the G train once I'm missing\n\nWhat's to debate? I'm the obvious win\n\nYou see only your NFL player only calls you a friend\n\nWhile your basketball nigga only calls for events\n\nAnd your personal trainer can't afford you these gyms\n\nI know that everyone alive has a past\n\nAnd you know that they ain't confident, they gonna ask\n\nAnd he know that he won't stick around for the crash\n\nAnd we know that I'm the only one that's gonna last (yeah)\n\n\n\nLove, I gotta warn you\n\nStarting to catch onto\n\nWhat you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)\n\nI've been losing patience\n\nYour mind is always changing\n\nBack and forth I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)\n\n\n\nLove, I gotta warn you\n\nStarting to catch onto\n\nWhat you make me go through (get going or I'm gone)\n\nI've been losing patience\n\nYour mind is always changing\n\nBack and forth I'm waiting (get going or I'm gone forever)\n\n\n\nI've been on a G train, in and out of Brooklyn\n\nCome and let me love you, I could take you places\n\nI've been on a G train, in and out of Brooklyn\n\nCome and let me love you, I could take you places"
