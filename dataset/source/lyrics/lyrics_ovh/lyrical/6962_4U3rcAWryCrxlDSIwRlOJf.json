  "lyrics": "A tangled acre\r\nOh tall tree shaker\r\nOh mountain maker\r\nOh mountain breaker\r\nOh faultline quaker\r\nA torn-off anchor\n\n\n\nAnd the hot hard healer\n\nIs a sweet street feeler\n\nAnd a wild wet wheeler\n\nThe pink prince of failures\n\nIs a spoiled sea sailor\n\nWith terns and wailers\n\n\n\nPulled up the ribbon\n\nPulled up the ribbon\n\nAnd brought into the light\n\nThrough the window, the door\n\n\n\nLike an air-blue eagle\n\nSailing through the ceiling\n\nAt the edge of feeling\n\nOn the emerald island\n\nAll the shipwrecked spy him\n\nAnd the searchlights shining\n\n\n\nAnd then pulled up the ribbon\n\nPulled up the ribbon\n\nAnd brought into the light\n\nPulled up the ribbon\n\nPulled up the ribbon\n\nAnd watched all in the sky\n\n\n\nYou pull up the ribbon\n\nYou pull up the ribbon\n\nAcross oceans of sky\n\nThrough the air, lifts on and on\n\nTill starlit and in and out we're drawn"
