Not I\n\nRather shop and pop by\n\nPull up in a drop five\n\nThe four-door M, no top and a Glock nine\n\nI'm in the player's suite when I stop at the stop sign\n\nI never tell a poor-ass nigga that I got mine\n\nUnless I'm in my nine and I'm really on that time\n\n'Cause I know it's on-site 'cause he tryna get me lined\n\nStay away from rats and them snakes and that swine, you'll be fine\n\n\n\nStayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat\n\nI'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets\n\nSo I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black\n\nStayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat\n\nI'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets\n\nSo I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black\n\n\n\nStayin' out the way, it's a new day\n\nUsed to be the handgun next to the cocaine\n\nFlyin' on the through-way, seals goin' in and out\n\nIf you from the slums, you ain't have venom\n\nYou don't give a fuck what the sinnin' 'bout\n\nJack boy, dope boy, better have the change\n\n'Cause I seen the game, I ain't gon' have shit to show for it\n\nNow I'm blowin' this weed, I'm gettin' chauffeured\n\nCould put you on a poster or give you my poster\n\nYou say you gettin' that money, I tell you go for it\n\nWanna reach for your hammer? I tell you go for it\n\n'Cause I put in my work and got the dough for it\n\nWhen you sold your ass and was a hoe for it\n\n\n\nStayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'Cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat\n\nI'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets\n\nSo I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black\n\nStayin' out the way-out the way of the pigs and the snakes 'Cause these vermin ass niggas gon' rat\n\nI'm about peace but I'm still up on the streets\n\nSo I'm lookin' at my piece like I left the shit black"
