  "lyrics": "I been waiting wide awake for the waves to come and take\r\nTake me right to you\r\nOne hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back\r\nWhat am I to do?\r\nFeel like I'm circling a giant all I see is the remains of an ugly truth\r\nOne hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back but they can't replace you\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh\n\nOh, oh, oh, ohh, ohh\n\n\n\nI was puttin' on for you like a jersey\n\nWhat I didn't know then couldn't hurt me\n\nNever thought you were gonna do me dirty\n\nLet me into cover on the east side I was burning\n\nBut that's just the way it goes\n\nWish that I could have control\n\nEverybody dies alone\n\n\n\nSave my breath but I lost faith a long time ago\n\nDream nightmares\n\nI guess we're getting used to losing hope\n\nI don't even wanna know why you don't answer when I call your name\n\nAre you on the other side? Will you save us?\n\nOr will you run away?\n\n\n\nI'm still waiting wide awake for the waves to come and take\n\nTake me right to you\n\nOne hundred vials of denial I know they won't bring you back\n\nWhat am I to do?\n\nCover, alibi, motive when I'm lying to myself of the ugly truth\n\nQuitters strangers to the flame\n\nWe will never be the same if we make it through (and we can make it through)\n\n\n\nMy back is up against the wall\n\nBut I used to feel invincible\n\nYeah it was us against the world\n\nBut somehow, someway, the take is coming\n\nI remember back then\n\nPlayed my cards right you were my best hand\n\nStill you keep me guessing\n\nWonder will I ever get the message\n\n\n\nSave my breath but I lost faith a long time ago\n\nDream nightmares\n\nI guess we're getting used to losing hope\n\nI don't even wanna know why you don't answer when I call your name\n\nAre you on the other side? Will you save us?\n\nOr will you run away?\n\n\n\nAre you on the other side? Will you save us?\n\nOr will you run away?"
