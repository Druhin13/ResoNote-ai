  "lyrics": "To get this think tank running\r\nI must suffer this drought\r\nYou're nothing but made of water\r\nMy brain is flooded with my doubt\r\nNow I draw in circles\r\nI saunter on and on\n\nTo carry your daughter\n\nSo you can show your unconditional love\n\n\n\nYour love, your love, your love\n\nYour love, your love, your love\n\n\n\nTo get this blood bank pumping\n\nI want all of you out\n\nThese bitches all make me ill and\n\nI do not bargain with self-love\n\nThis is my temple\n\nThis is my wailing wall\n\nAnd I will tell all\n\nAs my legacy is echoed on repeat\n\n\n\nTheir armies be close on my heels\n\nChase my shadow for nothing\n\nThey hunting for all of my skin\n\nThe walls of my shack to cave in\n\n\n\nTheir armies be close on my heels\n\nChase my shadow for nothing\n\nThey hunting for all of my skin\n\nThe walls of my shack to cave in\n\n\n\nYour love, your love, your love\n\n\n\nTo be the woman above all\n\nTo be the man that you want\n\nIt takes devotion and it takes affection\n\nTo fit this consummated part\n\nHollow perfection â€” objection\n\nYou make me feel none, none\n\nAll self-deception\n\nWhat you see, a mirage of ideals\n\n\n\nTheir armies be close on my heels\n\nChase my shadow for nothing\n\nThey hunting for all of my skin\n\nThe walls of my shack to cave in\n\n\n\nTheir armies be close on my heels\n\nChase my shadow for nothing\n\nThey hunting for all of my skin\n\nThe walls of my shack to cave in\n\n\n\nTheir armies be close on my heels\n\nChase my shadow for nothing\n\nTo get this blood bank pumping\n\nThey hunting for all of my skin\n\nThe walls of my shack to cave in\n\n\n\nYour love, your love, your love\n\nYour love, your love, your love"
