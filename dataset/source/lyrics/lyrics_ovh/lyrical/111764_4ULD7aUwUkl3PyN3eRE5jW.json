  "lyrics": "You're angry but you don't know how to be that yet\r\nIt seems too much went wrong and all at once\r\nResistance seems impossible from down this low\r\nAnd surely no one else can feel like this\r\nBut on the streets\n\nYou can see them gathering\n\nAnd in your heart\n\nYou know they feel like you do\n\n\n\nSound and pulse and volume\n\nHands just reaching other hands\n\nThis is almost overload\n\nI said almost overload\n\nFriends and foes and princes\n\nAre all just human in the end\n\nThis is so damn simple, yeah\n\nIt's so damn simple\n\n\n\nSo standing in the steady throne of restless hope\n\nYou don't feel like an outcast anymore\n\nAnd something deep inside of you has waken up\n\nAnd you know that nothing's gonna be the same again\n\n\n\nAnd on the streets\n\nYou can see for what seems miles\n\nBecause in your heart\n\nYou know they feel like you do\n\n\n\nSound and pulse and volume\n\nHands just reaching other hands\n\nThis is almost overload\n\nI said almost overload\n\nFriends and foes and princes\n\nAre all just human in the end\n\nThis is so damn simple, yeah\n\nIt's so damn simple\n\n\n\nYour mind won't be still\n\nIt may not again\n\nYou don't think it will\n\nBut it will, it will\n\n\n\nSound and pulse and volume\n\nHands just reaching other hands\n\nThis is so damn simple, yeah\n\nIt's so damn simple\n\nThis is so damn simple, yeah\n\nThis is so damn simple\n\nThis is so damn simple, yeah\n\nThis is so damn simple"
