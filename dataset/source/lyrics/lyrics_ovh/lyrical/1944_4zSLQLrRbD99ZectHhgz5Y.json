  "lyrics": "I know that you're sad\r\nI know that you're lonely\r\nyou lie awake 'till way past when\r\nI want you to know\r\nthat I'm leaving you only\r\n'cause I might not get the chance again.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nI'm cold and I'm tired\n\nand I can't stop coughing\n\nlong enough to tell you all of the news\n\nI'd like to tell you\n\nthat I'll see you more often\n\nbut often is a word I seldom use\n\noften is a word I seldom use.\n\n\n\nTell me, where did the weekend go?\n\nTell me, where did the weekend go?\n\nWent like thunder, felt like snow.\n\nWent like thunder, felt like snow.\n\n\n\nYou must think my life's a circus\n\nwatching me laughing\n\nand slapping my thighs\n\nhow'd ya like to die\n\nin the house of mirrors\n\nwith nobody around to close your eyes.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\n\n\nGoing down to the Greyhound station\n\ngoing back home\n\nand get what's mine\n\ngot me a date\n\nwith the ten o'clock special\n\ngonna be there at a quarter to nine.\n\n\n\nChorus:"
