  "lyrics": "You're last hope it echoes\r\nScreaming woah\r\nBut come down, the first blow\r\nIt sounds like oh\r\nIt can't black and white\r\nWe're on the other side tonight\n\nWe break free, we break free\n\nFrom pain, unite\n\nAnd look into my eyes\n\nA love overdue\n\n\n\nBurn our name under this list\n\nAnd we'll live until the sky gives up\n\nWatch our flame light up the dark\n\nThey won't find us in the book of love\n\n\n\nA whole new dimension is waiting\n\nSurrender intentions and watch you blow\n\nSo leave the world behind and listen to your heart\n\nIt's time to break free, to break free\n\nSo list your life, our love is on the line\n\nForever with you\n\n\n\n\n\nBurn our name under this list\n\nAnd we'll live until the sky gives up\n\nWatch our flame light up the dark\n\nThey won't find us in the book of love\n\n\n\nWoah\n\nAnd we'll live until the sky gives up\n\nWoah\n\nThey won't find us in the book of love\n\n\n\nIt's out of our control\n\nIf you don't you'll never know\n\nSo give into the chemicals\n\nIt's never too late\n\nThey're only testing our faith\n\n\n\nBurn our name under this list\n\nAnd we'll live until the sky gives up\n\nWatch our flame light up the dark\n\nThey won't find us in the book of love\n\n\n\nAnd we'll live until the sky gives up\n\nThey won't find us in the book of love"
