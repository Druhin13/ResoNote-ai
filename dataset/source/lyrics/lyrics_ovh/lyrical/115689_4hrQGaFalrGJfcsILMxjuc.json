I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\n\n\n\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\n\nA man under cover but you tore me apart\n\nNow, I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again\n\n\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\n\nBut the very next day you gave it away\n\nThis year, to save me from tears\n\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my heart\n\nBut the very next day you gave it away\n\nThis year, to save me from tears\n\nI'll give it to someone special"
