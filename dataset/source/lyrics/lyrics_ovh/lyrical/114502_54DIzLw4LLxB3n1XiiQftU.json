  "lyrics": "In an age of darkness light appears\r\nAnd it wards away the ancient fears\r\nMarch to the anthem of the heart\r\nTo a brand new day, a brand new start\r\nTo wonder lands of ice and snow\n\nIn the desert heat where nothing grows\n\nA tree of life in rain and sun\n\nTo reach the sky it’s just begun\n\n\n\nAnd as we came into the clear\n\nTo find ourselves where we are here\n\nWho is the wiser to help us steer\n\nAnd will we know when the end is near\n\n\n\nBeauty lives in every soul\n\nThe more you love the more you know\n\nThey pass the torch and it still burns\n\nOnce children then it’s now our turn\n\n\n\nAnd as we came into the clear\n\nTo find ourselves where we are here\n\nWho is the wiser to help us steer\n\nAnd will we know when the end is near\n\n\n\nAnd as we came into the clear\n\nTo find ourselves where we are here\n\nWho is the wiser to help us steer\n\nAnd will we know when the end is near"
