  "lyrics": "We overcame, changin' lanes\r\nColored lights, bright and yellow-blue\r\nShow me the love, feelin' numb\r\nTracks are gone, I'm in two\r\nYou dreamed a little black, dreamed a little white\r\nA splash of colored paint won't do\n\nSo we played the pain and took a walk away\n\nAnd sewed our halves back in two\n\nIf I only knew\n\nWe coulda quit the pain, and sooner overcame\n\nNo purple rain for you\n\n\n\nSo don't you change\n\nDon't (If I could tell you)\n\nSo don't you change (Change)\n\nOh, baby\n\nDon't (If I could tell you)\n\nDon't\n\n\n\nYou're so contagious\n\nLike falling embers you flew\n\nOut into orbit, now I can't absorb it\n\nThe starlight your eyes do\n\nFor all we couldn't know\n\nThe past we should've grown\n\nKingdom and a throne, all jewels\n\nBut the cracks were paved, still all the hope remained\n\nAnd purple rain came through\n\n\n\nSo don't you change\n\nDon't (If I could tell you)\n\nSo don't you change (Change)\n\nOh, baby\n\nDon't (If I could tell you)\n\nDon't\n\n\n\nDarling just remain the same\n\nDon't let me fade away\n\nWe can't have it all\n\nYou build and I fall\n\nSo it goes\n\nHoldin' on's kinda fake\n\nPurple gold, purple rain\n\nWe can't have it all\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\n\n\n\nSo don't you change, no\n\nDon't (If I could tell you)\n\nDon't you change (Change)\n\nOh, baby\n\nDon't (If I could tell you)\n\nDon't"
