  "lyrics": "She told me that she loved me by the water fountain\r\nShe told me that she loved me and she didn't love him\r\nAnd that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent\r\nBut now she's got a cup with something else in it\r\nIt's getting kind of blurry at a quarter past ten\r\nAnd he was in a hurry to be touching her skin\n\nShe's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him\n\nForgetting what she told me by the water fountain\n\n\n\nNow he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in\n\nKissing her lips, and whispering in her ear\n\nAnd she knows that she shouldn't listen\n\nAnd that she should be with me by the water fountain\n\nShe couldn't be at home in the night time because\n\nIt made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young\n\nI was too young\n\n\n\nI should've built a home with a fountain for us\n\nThe moment that she told me that she was in love\n\nToo young\n\nI was too young\n\n(Too young)...\n\n\n\nAnd if she ever goes back to the water fountain\n\nThe handle will be broken and the rust set in\n\nBut my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it\n\nMy heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it\n\n\n\nNow I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in\n\nKissing her lips, and whispering in her ear\n\nAnd I know that it's only a wish\n\nAnd that we're not standing by the water fountain\n\n(Too young)...\n\n\n\nShe couldn't be at home in the night time\n\nBecause it made her feel alone\n\nBut at that time she was too young\n\nI was too young\n\n\n\nI should've built a home with a fountain for us\n\nThe moment that she told me that she was in love\n\nToo young\n\nI was too young\n\n(Too young)...\n\n\n\nI should've built a home with a fountain for us\n\nThe moment that she told me that she was in love\n\nToo young\n\nI was too young"
