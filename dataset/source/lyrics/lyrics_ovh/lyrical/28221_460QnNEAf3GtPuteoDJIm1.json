  "lyrics": "Can you imagine life with no more rain?\r\nNo more dark times and no more pain?\r\nCan you imagine life with no more hurting?\r\nWake up every day and shit is perfect\r\nCan you picture life with no more struggle?\r\nNo more overtime or working doubles\n\nAnd there wouldn't be no racism\n\nCause nobody was born with hate in them\n\nCan we have a time with no more evil?\n\nNo more lies to divide the people\n\nAnd our leaders really strive to lead you\n\nAnd when you die they got a spot to keep you\n\nCan you imagine life with no more rain?\n\nNo more dark times and no more pain?\n\nCan you imagine life with no more hurting?\n\nWake up every day and shit is perfect\n\nI think we deserve it, quick call the nurses\n\nMy heart is bursting, I'm tired of hurting\n\nThe sky is burning, my mind is searching\n\nLet's find a purpose, at time's I'm nervous\n\nIt's so disturbing, just hope it's working\n\nFell close to worthless\n\nCan you imagine life with no more rain?\n\nNo more dark times and no more pain?\n\nCan you imagine life with no more hurting?\n\nWake up every day and shit is perfect\n\nDon't know if we deserve it\n\nImagine"
