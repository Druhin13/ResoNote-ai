  "lyrics": "When I'm with you, it doesn't matter where we are,\r\nOr what we're doing. I'm with you, that's all that matters.\r\nTime passes much too quickly when we're together laughing.\r\nI wish I could sing it to you, oh no,\r\nI wish I could sing it to you.\r\nMostly I'm silent.\n\nNever think about words to say.\n\nWhen I kiss you, I feel a thousand different feelings.\n\nThe color of chills all over my body.\n\nAnd when I feel them, I quickly try to decide which one\n\nI should try to put into words, oh no,\n\nTry to put into words.\n\nMostly I'm silent.\n\nOnly the beginning of what I want to feel forever.\n\nOnly the beginning. Only just the start.\n\nI've got to get you into my life.\n\nGot to get you next to me.\n\nOnly the beginning. Only just the start."
