  "lyrics": "Stirring, shaken, all of us waking \nUnder the same cover of sky \nYou said my freedom feels \nLike a white lie \nSweet on the backseat \n\nAnother day bolder \n\nA love spell rushes you by \n\nThe smoke and the smoulder \n\nWe were only inches away \n\nStill had a long, long way to go \n\n\n\nWeren’t we born to break out \n\nTo feel the muddy banks swell? \n\nI think of you on the dancefloor \n\nIn a stuccoed motel \n\nForecasting when and where we’d end up \n\nCouldn’t save us anyhow \n\nJust kid conversation \n\nMy star sign resolver \n\n\n\nYou only had your olympic girls \n\nThe frosted sheen of leotard twirls \n\nRunning revolt and winning gold \n\nFor the TV screen \n\nBefore being led back to the cells \n\n\n\nLay your head in the lap of a girl \n\nYou’ll never learn something \n\nIf it isn’t taught well \n\nYou’ll never find a thing \n\nIf you can’t lose yourself \n\nEvery once in a while \n\n\n\nI looked for your figure \n\nThe cut your shape would make \n\nIn the freedom of a microphone \n\nThere’s a shadow I can’t shake \n\nWho’s there? \n\n\n\nWho’s there in the morning? \n\nTo see you at the station \n\nAnd when you feel like giving up \n\nThere, so you can hold her \n\n\n\nWe were only inches away \n\nStill had a long, long way to go \n\nWe're only inches away \n\nStill have a long, long way to go"
