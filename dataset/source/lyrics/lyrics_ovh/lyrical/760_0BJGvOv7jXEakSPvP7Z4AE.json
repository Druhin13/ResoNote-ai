  "lyrics": "Seventeen, driving fast in a stolen car\r\nWhy'd you give me the keys to your heart?\r\nWe were young, felt like love, thought we knew it all\r\nClosed our eyes, took a shot in the dark\r\nEh\n\nI got scared and you noticed\n\nShowed your cards but I folded\n\nI blame me for you leaving\n\nI blame me for you going\n\nNow you're living your new life\n\nI'm still stuck in these highlights\n\nBreaking down\n\n\n\nUsed to have it all\n\nThrew it all away\n\nNow you're just an imprint on my pillowcase\n\nUsed to have it all\n\nLost it in the waves\n\nNow there's just an imprint where you used to lay\n\nNow there's just an imprint that you left on me\n\n\n\nTwenty two, now I miss all the little things\n\nLike how you slept on my side of the bed\n\nHow you make me feel I could do anything\n\nBut now I'm drinking my courage instead\n\n\n\nOh I fucked up bad and I know it\n\nYou was there at my lowest\n\nI blame me for you leaving\n\nI blame me for you going\n\nNow you're living your new life\n\nI'm still stuck in these highlights\n\nBreaking down\n\n\n\nUsed to have it all\n\nThrew it all away\n\nNow you're just an imprint on my pillowcase\n\nUsed to have it all\n\nLost it in the waves\n\nNow there's just an imprint where you used to lay\n\nNow there's just an imprint that I can't erase\n\n\n\nMhm\n\nMhm\n\nMhm\n\nNo\n\n\n\nUsed to have it all\n\nThrew it all away\n\nNow you're just an imprint on my pillowcase\n\nUsed to have it all\n\nLost it in the waves\n\nNow there's just an imprint where you used to lay\n\nNow there's just an imprint that you left on me"
