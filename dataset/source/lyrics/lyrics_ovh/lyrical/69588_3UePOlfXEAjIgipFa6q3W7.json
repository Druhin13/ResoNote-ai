  "lyrics": "Hot summer night, hand in mine\r\nYou're looking so right, it's dangerous\r\nDon't know if I can trust myself\r\nWith those blue eyes and the moonlight\r\nShining so bright\r\nOut on the edge of town\n\nThis spot only you and me know about\n\nDancing to an old truck radio\n\nIn a wide open field where we're alone\n\nGot my heart feeling like a sparkle in the dark\n\nWhen you kiss me\n\nDrunk off your lips, yeah they're making me go\n\nCrazy for you baby and I'm losing control\n\nIt's spreading fast and every sip is hitting me\n\nLike wildfire, wildfire and whiskey\n\nWhen you feel that there's no going back\n\nAlready lit the match\n\nWe gotta burn it down\n\nSo keep spinnin' me 'round and around and around\n\nDancing to an old truck radio\n\nIn a wide open field where we're alone\n\nGot my heart feeling like a sparkle in the dark\n\nWhen you kiss me\n\nDrunk off your lips, yeah, they're making me go\n\nCrazy for you baby and I'm losing control\n\nIt's spreading fast and every sip is hitting me\n\nLike wildfire, wildfire and whiskey\n\nTomorrow we could be ashes on the ground\n\nWe did too much, too fast\n\nFeeling like hanging around, right now\n\nWe're dancing to an old truck radio\n\nIn a wide open field where we're all alone\n\nGot my heart feeling like a sparkle in the dark\n\nWhen you kiss me\n\nDrunk off your lips, yeah they're making me go\n\nCrazy for you baby and I'm losing control\n\nIt's spreading fast and every sip is hitting me\n\nLike wildfire, wildfire and whiskey\n\nWhen you kiss me\n\nLike wildfire and whiskey"
