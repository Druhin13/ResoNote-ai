  "lyrics": "Feel the fire where she walks\r\nLola Montez so beautiful\r\nshady and a tempered dame\r\nblinding your eyes with her spider dance\r\nHer perfomance utterly erotic subversive to all ideas\n\nand for public morality\n\nand cool as she was she didn't care\n\nsee the miner throw his gold\n\nlifting her skirt howling loud like a wolf\n\nhell raising and full of sin\n\nwhen lola was dancing and showing her skin\n\n\n\nWhereever she walks\n\nshe will be captivating all the men\n\ndon't look in her eyes\n\nyou might fall and find the love of your life heavenly\n\nbut she'll catch you in her web\n\nthe love of your life\n\n\n\nWell notorious I have been\n\nbut never for fame that's what she said\n\ndear Henry taste my whip\n\nnever to see any words you print\n\n\n\nOh Lola I'm sure that the love would have been\n\nthe key to all your pain\n\nno words will later come\n\ndid she spider bite your tongue\n\nwe will surely not forget the lola spider dance"
