  "lyrics": "At last, my love has come along\r\nMy lonely days are over\r\nAnd life is like a song\r\nOhh yeah yeah...At last\r\nthe skies above are blue\n\nMy heart was wrapped up in clover\n\nThe night I looked at you\n\n\n\nI found a dream, that I could speak to\n\nA dream that I can call my own\n\nI found a thrill to press my cheek to\n\nA thrill that I have never known...\n\nYou smile, you smile\n\noh And then the spell was cast\n\nAnd here we are in heaven\n\nFor you are mine at last"
