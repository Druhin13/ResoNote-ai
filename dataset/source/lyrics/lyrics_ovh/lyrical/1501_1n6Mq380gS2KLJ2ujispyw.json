  "lyrics": "Face down\r\nFeeding into you, find the weakness\r\nHolding it down till we kill it\r\nEvery once in awhile, I get caught in that silver lining\r\nNo one ever lives it\n\nWhat's the meaning?\n\nWhat's the meaning?\n\nSomewhere, we all lost the spirit\n\nLost it all\n\n\n\nSo save us\n\nJust so we know\n\nThat the bitter taste, we need it\n\nAnd we forgive ourselves and leave it all\n\n\n\nI want it now\n\n\n\nChoke it all down till we're speechless\n\nKeep holding your breath till I need it\n\nEvery once in a while\n\nWe all want that silver lining\n\n\n\nNo one ever lives it\n\nWhat's the meaning?\n\nWhat's the meaning?\n\nSomehow I know I'm not alone\n\n\n\nSo save us\n\nJust so we know\n\nThat the bitter taste, we need it\n\nAnd we forgive ourselves and leave it all\n\nIn the space that's between right and wrong\n\nThe better days deceived us\n\n\n\nWe let ourselves believe it all\n\nAnd god just bites his tongue\n\n\n\nWe chase the seconds away\n\nLike the wind and the rain\n\nI always loved the storm\n\nWe pray to see better days\n\nPlease god be willing\n\n\n\nSo save us\n\nJust so we know\n\nThat the bitter taste, we need it\n\nAnd we forgive ourselves and leave it all\n\nBeneath it all between the right and wrong\n\nThe better days deceived us\n\n\n\nAnd we let ourselves believe it all\n\nAnd god just bites his tongue"
