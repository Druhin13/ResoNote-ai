Nothin' but the best\n\nNothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind\n\nI ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?\n\nI think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind\n\nWhat did you do expect? Nothin' but the best\n\n\n\nUh-oh, you let the blood spill fuck up your flow\n\nAll my local rastas totin' yoppers\n\nRollin' ganja then I slide in vagina you sponsor\n\nHow that nine to five workin' out?\n\nI used to be just like you, keep in mind we do this shit for the freeski\n\nMe, Johnny V, J-I-Deesky, mixtape Weezy made it look easy\n\nLil did we know 'bout all the politics and meetings\n\nAnd these old ass pussy niggas caught up in they feelings\n\nRat race is everlastin', I'm an eagle to it\n\nOnly swoopin' when I need to do it\n\nEarned my stripes, bitch I'm Beetlejuice-in'\n\nBurnin' lights, I want to see you movin'\n\nFertilize even though I don't believe in shootin', hey\n\nTake it easy my nigga\n\nShit get greezy every minute that you let the skillet sit\n\nHands free, don't say shit to me about the penmanship\n\nHave the backwood rolled before I finish this, 'til it's\n\n\n\nNothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind\n\nI ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?\n\nI think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind\n\nWhat did you do expect? Nothin' but the best\n\nNothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind\n\nI ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?\n\nI think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind\n\nWhat did you do expect? Nothin' but the best\n\n\n\nHuh, got to be (got to be)\n\nMore careful with the style, just\n\nTacklin' (my issues), my issues in them Valiums\n\nYou like if Sade and Juicy J had a child, well\n\nHoney if, you brave then, maybe you should pick the style-yum\n\nRidin' on the leaves through the lightning though\n\nFallin' on my knees, what you like to know\n\nI whip the feast, I put the heat while under microscopes\n\nNow stream all the reasons to syphon the flow\n\nSay though I gotta keep it easy, dragon fly with the reezy\n\nBat an eye at the pastor then catapult to the precinct\n\nNaturally check the balance and negatively decreasin'\n\nNo ration for tiger passion, abundantly me releasin'\n\n\n\nNothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind\n\nI ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?\n\nI think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind\n\nWhat did you do expect? Nothin' but the best\n\nNothin' but the best, hundred million on my mind\n\nI ain't got it yet, tell me why you wastin' time?\n\nI think I been saved, guessin' next I'm goin' blind\n\nWhat did you do expect? Nothin' but the best"
