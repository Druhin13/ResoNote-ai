  "lyrics": "Remember one Christmas I gave you Jim Carroll\r\nIntended it as a cautionary tale\r\nYou said you saw yourself inside there\r\nDocketed like a two manual\r\nRemember one summer we walked in Times Square\r\nI showed you the zombies with hundred-inch stares\n\nYou took a big, set your hotel on fire\n\nWe took the blame, took the bags to the train\n\n\n\nHappy Birthday, Johnny\n\nWherever you are\n\nHappy Birthday, Johnny\n\nWherever you are\n\n\n\nThe last time you called it was on New Years' Eve\n\nYou asked me for dough to get somethin' to eat\n\nSince we last spoke, you live on the street\n\nYeah, I wouldn't believe all the shit that you seen\n\n\n\nHappy New Year, Johnny\n\nIs it 23?\n\nHappy New Year, Johnny\n\nAre the lights on the trees?\n\n\n\nWhen I said, let me think, and you yelled through your teeth\n\nAccused me of actin' like all royalty\n\nAlways for show, no true charity\n\nYou saw me on magazines and TV\n\nBut they only knew the real version of me\n\nOnly you know the secrets, the swamp, and the fear\n\nWhat happened to blood, our family?\n\nAnnie, how could you do this to me?\n\nOf course, I blame me\n\nWhen you get free, Johnny\n\nI hope you find peace"
