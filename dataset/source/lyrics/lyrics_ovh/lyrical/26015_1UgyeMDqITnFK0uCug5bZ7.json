  "lyrics": "The weight of the waves are crashing down on me\r\nAnd all I can hear is thunder in the distance\r\nIt's all the past for now\r\nI could not see before\r\nThe clouds had shroud\n\nAll that we had been\n\n\n\nIf beauty is in the eye of the beholder\n\nIt's black and white it's black and white\n\nIf beauty is in the eye of the beholder\n\nOr in the eye of the storm\n\nAnd my heart is growing darker\n\n\n\nHeavy hearts like heavy clouds\n\nI try to pick myself back up\n\nBut I keep falling down\n\n\n\nBut I keep falling down\n\nBut I keep falling down\n\nMy knees are weak I'm losing sleep\n\nBut I keep falling down\n\n\n\nStronger than I used to be\n\nYou were the only one who doubted me\n\nAnd now I'm stronger than I used to be\n\nSo fucking witness me"
