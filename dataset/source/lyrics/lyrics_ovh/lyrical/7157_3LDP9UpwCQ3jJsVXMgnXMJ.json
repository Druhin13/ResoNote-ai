  "lyrics": "Heart, don't give up on me now\r\nWe've got a long way to go\r\nI know we've put in some miles, me and you\r\nBut I can still see the road\r\nI can understand all the hell I've put you through\n\nYou took it like a man and now you've got the scars to prove\n\n\n\nThat it's hard on a heart\n\nHard on a heart\n\nYou never know what you're up against\n\nAnd that's hard on a heart\n\nFightin' a war that you'll never win\n\nFallin' in love just to lose again\n\nIt's hard on a heart\n\n\n\nI know there's no turnin' back\n\nThe damage is done\n\nYou know all we've gotta do, me and you:\n\nWe've gotta move on\n\n\n\nI know you know I hate the way you feel\n\nI never give you long enough to heal\n\n\n\nAnd that's hard on a heart\n\nHard on a heart\n\nYou never know what you're up against\n\nAnd that's hard on a heart\n\nFightin' a war that you'll never win\n\nFallin' in love just to lose again\n\nIt's hard on a heart\n\n\n\nYou never know what you're up against\n\nAnd that's hard on a heart\n\nFightin' a war that you'll never win\n\nI'm startin' to think most everything is\n\nHard on a heart"
