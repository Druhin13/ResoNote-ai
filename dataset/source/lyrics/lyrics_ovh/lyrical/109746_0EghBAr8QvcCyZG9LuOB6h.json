  "lyrics": "I ain't the one\r\nI never was the one, just another son of a son of a gun\r\nGrandpa had the skin of a drum\r\nRu-ru-run but you can't escape what you came from\r\nBite your tounge, chew blood like it's gum\r\nClimb aboard the diving board, time gets shorter when a child is born\n\nI'm a quiet storm but when I'm dry and warm I take final form until you slice the chord\n\nAnd make the line go flat on that life support\n\nI gotta make some space so I can reach these stars\n\nMy face looks like an old race car, tryin' to put it together before it came apart\n\nAnd when they lay my parts where my name is carved, they should save my heart in this mason jar\n\nMinnesota, Uber drivers, Google Maps to the universal fibers\n\nYou're nobody 'til you stole some lighters, cat burglar disguised as a nervous tiger\n\nWe've been to many places but earth is liver\n\nSave it, give me likes and favorites\n\nEverybody's famous, I'mma need a lifetime of patience\n\nRemind me what your name is? You won't find me in the known locations, I'd rather be alone in my beautiful basement, whoo\n\n\n\nThis on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to\n\nAnd you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, uh\n\nOr we can fight about it after school\n\nWhatever you have to do, I'm cool\n\n\n\nWhen I leave this Earth, feel the after tremors, might see my curse upon the back of the mirrors\n\nGraffiti bridge is all tags and stickers, but we are the children of the action figures\n\nAnd now we drop likes matchsticks, figures\n\nI got too many friends, and I can't keep up with the trends\n\nAnd I know that I'm supposed to pretend, like I'm afraid of the day that it's all gonna end, where the hell have you been? And how did time get spent, huh?\n\nI gotta, gotta stop messin' about\n\nStick the neck out like you're stretching it out\n\nThe king wears a crown made of clouds, the whole crowd will get loud if you miss this foul\n\nIf you don't mind I'mma go mind my business now, whoo\n\n\n\nThis on my list of shit to do, after I pick which whisper to listen to\n\nAnd you can kiss my ass until your lips are blue, uh\n\nOr we can fight about it after school\n\nBut all ya'll are full of shit, and I'm cool"
