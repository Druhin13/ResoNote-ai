  "lyrics": "We're all lookin' for a message here\r\nA little wisdom on a souvenir\r\nAnother bottle with an S.O.S\r\nThrow it in the water and pray for the best\r\nThere ain't a compass or a northern star\r\nThat ever really tells us where we are\n\nWe're just a shore runnin' out of sand\n\nAnd reachin' for a hand\n\n\n\nEvery heart is an island\n\nBut no one's alone\n\nShip wrecked in a high wind\n\nTryin' to find our way home\n\nAnd every tear is an ocean\n\nWe're all brothers in a storm\n\nAnd we're tyrin' to survive it\n\nLookin' for dry land\n\nEvery heart is an island\n\n\n\nSilverlinin' is kinda hard to find\n\nWhen the world stops at the horizon line\n\nThere ain't a harbor that you'll recognize\n\nIt's hard to make a wish in an empty sky\n\nBoardwalks are just nails and wood\n\nThe pretty and a picture when times are good\n\nCars and boats are just on loan\n\nOur house is just sticks and stones\n\n\n\nEvery heart is an island\n\nBut no one's alone\n\nShip wrecked in a high wind\n\nTryin' to find our way home\n\nAnd every tear is an ocean\n\nWe're all brothers in a storm\n\nAnd we're tyrin' to survive it\n\nLookin' for dry land\n\nEvery heart is an island\n\n\n\nEvery heart is an island\n\nAnd no one's alone\n\nShip wrecked in a high wind\n\nTryin' to find our way home\n\nAnd every tear is an ocean\n\nWe're all brothers in a storm\n\nAnd we're tyrin' to survive it\n\nLookin' for dry land\n\nEvery heart is an island\n\nEvery heart is an island"
