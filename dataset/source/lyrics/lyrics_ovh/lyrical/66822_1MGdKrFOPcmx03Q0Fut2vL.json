  "lyrics": "I can see the path you're cutting\r\nIt cost me a little piece of my heart\r\nI can see the doors you're shutting\r\n'Cause they were open at the start\r\nBaby loving you has been hard on me\n\nYou're such a tough little sister\n\nJust looking for Mr. Right\n\nOn the wrong side of town\n\n\n\nYou better Love Somebody\n\nIt's late\n\nYou better Love Somebody\n\nDon't wait\n\nYou better Love Somebody\n\nDon't tempt fate\n\nYou're gonna pull you just a little too far\n\nOne night\n\n\n\nYour eyes are wild, your skin so white\n\nYou're undernourished and overfed\n\nShe's got the teeth, she knows how to bite\n\n'Cause when you bit I bled\n\nYou got the perfect image\n\nOf the perfect man\n\nYou're a tough little sister\n\nBut you'll settle for a mister tonight\n\nBut you're running out of time\n\n\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nIt's late\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nDon't wait\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nDon't tempt fate\n\nYou're gonna pull you just a little too far\n\nOne night\n\n\n\nI'm only saying what I feel\n\nYou think I'm wrong I know\n\nYou thought I was sleeping at the wheel\n\nI thought that you were driving\n\n\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nIt's late\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nDon't wait\n\nYou better love somebody\n\nDon't tempt fate\n\nThey're gonna pull you just a little too far\n\nOne night..."
