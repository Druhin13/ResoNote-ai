Doors open on the left at Roosevelt.\"\r\nTake me anywhere\r\nI am a nervous passenger\r\nI'll make it back if I can\r\nI won't make you wait forever\n\n\n\nI swear I'll meet you\n\nWhere the violets in the Spring bloom\n\nCome out, the blood in my veins\n\nEnough blood in my veins\n\n\n\nSo take me anywhere\n\nI am a nervous passenger\n\nI'll make you deaf if I can\n\nI wanna make you wait forever\n\n\n\nWhat more to honor crooks and thieves\n\nWhat more when we're meant to be\n\nIs it too late to save me\n\nOr am I only a distant memory"
