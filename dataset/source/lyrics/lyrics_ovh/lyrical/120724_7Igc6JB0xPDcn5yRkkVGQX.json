We should be homies\n\nI think we could be bigger than cheese and macaroni\n\nWe could keep it sweet like Chachi and Joanie\n\nOh, maybe just be ourselves, never phony.\"\n\nNever second guessing the freindship connection\n\nParallel living, never in possesion of your individual personal expression\n\nTogether we're just a much better reflection of\n\nLove\n\n\n\nWe could be homies\n\nAnd once you get to know me\n\nI could be your one and only\n\nI could make you unlonely\n\nWe could take it slowly\n\nAnd we could keep it lowkey\n\nI could be your one and only\n\nI could make you unlonely\n\n\n\nLove, la-la-la-la, love\n\nLove, la-la-la\n\nOne and only, I could make you unlonely\n\nLove, la-la-la-la, love\n\nLove, la-la-la\n\nOne and only, I could make you unlonely\n\n\n\nWhen the table's set for two\n\nAnd there's nobody with you\n\nSeeing movies by yourself\n\nLet me be your someone else\n\nIf you're spending time alone\n\nIf it's just you and your phone\n\nTaking pictures of yourself\n\nBaby, maybe I can help\n\n\n\nIt could be love\n\nWe could be homies\n\nAnd once you get to know me\n\nI could be your one and only\n\nI could make you unlonely, oh\n\nWe could take it slowly\n\nAnd we could keep it lowkey\n\nI could be your one and only\n\nI could make you unlonely\n\n\n\nLove, la-la-la-la, love\n\nLove, la-la-la\n\nOne and only, I could make you unlonely\n\n\n\nIt could be love\n\nWe could be homies \n\nAnd once you get to know me \n\nI could be your one and only\n\nI could make you unlonely"
