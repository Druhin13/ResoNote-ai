  "lyrics": "Should've been a lawman, diamond in hand with a radical creed\r\nShould've punched clocks on the beers and the docks makin' concrete\r\nI've seen ships down in Savannah left their ivory sails soar\r\nI could've gotten used to life it seems\r\nCould've been a doctor livin' in a mansion, rich as I'd be\r\nCould've had a fast car, young blonde girlfriend all for free\n\nI like to think in some town far away there'd be a man like I am now\n\nHe will feel that he was losin' touch, lost too much\n\n\n\nHigh in the country\n\nWhere the skies are blue\n\nHigh in the country\n\nWhere I dream of you\n\n\n\nWell I'm down with the devil, I'm down with the saints\n\nI'm layin' on thick, fresh coats of paint\n\nTake it all back, take it all back, Jack\n\nShe never loved a damn thing, never lost faith\n\nI would die a thousand deaths to end up in her lovin' arms\n\nEvery chance I had I threw away, I spent everyday\n\n\n\nHigh in the country\n\nWhere the skies are blue\n\nHigh in the country\n\nWhere I dream of you\n\n\n\nWhere I dream of you\n\nAs I dream of you\n\n\n\nHigh in the country\n\nWhere the strong wind blew\n\nHigh in the country\n\nWhere I dream of you\n\n\n\nStill I dream of you"
