  "lyrics": "Beware, Beware the daughter of the sea\r\nBeware, I heard him cry\r\nHis words carried upon the ocean breeze\r\nAs he sank beneath the tide\r\nThose blood-soaked shores of Kalimdor,\n\nwhere sailors fought and died\n\nThe Admiral fell at Theramore\n\nBecause she left his side\n\n\n\nWhy this? Why this, oh daughter of the sea?\n\nWhy this? Did you forget your seaside days?\n\nAlways the pride of our nation's eyes\n\nHow could she go astray?\n\n\n\nWhen she did flee across the ocean deep\n\nThe Admiral followed west\n\nWhat else but sail to save a daughter's life,\n\nAnd pray she still drew breath?\n\n\n\nBut there he found upon those distant shores\n\nEnemies 'pon the rise!\n\nBut when he faced those savage foes,\n\nHis daughter stood aside!\n\n\n\nAnd buried deep beneath the waves\n\nBetrayed by family\n\nTo his nation with his last breath, cried\n\n\"Beware the daughter of the sea!\""
