  "lyrics": "Sweet breeze, blowin' through a summer dress\r\nSeen from a window above\r\nCaptured in the eyes of love\r\nShivers, in the cool forbidden dawn\r\nWhere the Iris and Jasmin run wild\n\nShe was young and he was a child\n\n\n\nHe vanished like July\n\nSome folks, they wondered why\n\nBut old money has its friends\n\nAin't it funny how the truth will bend\n\n\n\nIt's the family secret, don't pass it on\n\nDaddy's angel 'til something went wrong\n\nIt's the family secret of her mystery...\n\n\n\nWhispers, how they sound like raindrops\n\nHush now we'll make it alright\n\nShe's framed by the front porch light\n\nUuuhuh, suspicion, raising up like dragonflies\n\nThey say there's a story to tell\n\nBuried in the family well\n\n\n\nNow the congregation prays\n\nSave us from our evil ways\n\nBut old money has its friends\n\nAin't it funny how the truth will bend\n\n\n\nIt's the family secret, it's the family secret, don't pass it on\n\nDaddy's angel 'til something went wrong\n\nIt's the family secret, just let it be\n\nI know the secret of her mystery...\n\n\n\nIt's the family secret, it's the family secret\n\nIt's the family secret, don't pass it on\n\nDaddy's angel 'til something went wrong\n\nIt's the family secret, just let it be\n\nI know the secret to her mystery\n\n\n\nKeep it in the family now, behind closed doors\n\nPast the rows of cypress trees, through the Spanish moss\n\nThose old stone walls\n\nIt's the family secret, it's the family secret"
