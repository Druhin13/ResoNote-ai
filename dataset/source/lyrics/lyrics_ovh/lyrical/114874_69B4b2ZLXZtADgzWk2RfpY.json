  "lyrics": "Focus on you in the light, it helps me fill my emotions\r\nWhy are we at such a distance? Find ourselves so out of frame\r\nThis love stays calm in the night, yeah, help me heal and reopen\r\nWhy are we drifting away from everything we wanted to save?\r\nI told you I'd be down forever\n\nLoving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong\n\nIt's old news, I should look for better\n\nFalling back to strangers, leave me hanging on\n\n\n\nFlare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late\n\nStill I dial those numbers every time\n\nWhy do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?\n\nSlowly wishing you were never mine\n\n\n\nYour face became all I know, I'd try to picture another\n\nWhy are we frayed at the edge, it's making me feel all to blame\n\nI wanna know what's the deal\n\nWhere have you been and what do you think of me?\n\nIs it a new girl silently screaming your name?\n\n\n\nI told you I'd be down forever\n\nLoving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong\n\nIt's old news, I should look for better\n\nFalling back to strangers, leave me hanging on\n\nYou leave me hanging on\n\n\n\nFlare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late\n\nStill I dial those numbers every time\n\nWhy do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?\n\nSlowly wishing you were never mine\n\n\n\nI told you I'd be down forever\n\nLoving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong\n\nIt's old news, I should look for better\n\nFalling back to strangers, leave me hanging on\n\n\n\nSee, I don't know better than to give up on loving\n\nWhy am I still holding on? I'm still holding on\n\nAnd I'm way too honest and you make me want it\n\nLying alone all night long, alone all night long\n\n\n\nFlare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late\n\nStill I dial those numbers every time\n\nWhy do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?\n\nSlowly wishing you were never mine\n\n\n\nFlare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late\n\nStill I dial those numbers every time\n\n(Still I dial those numbers every time)\n\nWhy do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?\n\nSlowly wishing you were never mine\n\n(Slowly wishing you were never mine)"
