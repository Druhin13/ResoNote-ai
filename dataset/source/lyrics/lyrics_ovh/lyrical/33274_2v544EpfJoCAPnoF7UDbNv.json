  "lyrics": "I know what it’s like when a season ends\r\nFrom growing weary, to making amends\r\nFrom unforgiveness to love to lend\r\nThings always end just like a trend\r\nAlthough on earth the seasons change\n\nWe all adjust to who went and who came\n\nThis life we live, it gives us rage\n\nBut there’s one thing that will always remain\n\n\n\nIt’s that silly thing you do\n\nIt’s your smile that is so true\n\nIt’s your courage, it’s your you\n\nIt’s the love that lives inside of you"
