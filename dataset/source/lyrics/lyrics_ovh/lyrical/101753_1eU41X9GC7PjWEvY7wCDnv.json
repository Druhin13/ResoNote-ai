  "lyrics": "You sweep across the heavens, an extinction grade event\r\nAnd carve your name upon the gates where angels fear to tread\r\nAll hail my\r\nYou shine like blood and diamonds, you sing like breaking glass\n\nYou drag them out into the street and turn their names to ash\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nYou hum like quiet lightning in the eye of a typhoon\n\nA bird of illest omen crowing all impending doom\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nThe whisper of unnerving truth when saner minds depart\n\nYou rise like Christ the Savior, you burn as Joan of Arc\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nYou bring the axe upon them with devastating grace\n\nAnd on their heads, forever lay a curse upon their fate\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nMy spirit on unhinging force, my avalanche untamed\n\nBearing down relentlessly on all who dare remain\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nMy unnatural disaster\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nMy kaleidoscopic gloom\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nMy karmic equalizer\n\n\n\nAll hail my\n\n\n\nMy cemetery bloom"
