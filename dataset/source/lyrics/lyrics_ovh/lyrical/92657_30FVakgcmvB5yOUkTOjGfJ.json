  "lyrics": "If I was a race car driver \nWell, I'd be right behind her \nI'd be doing 90 in a 55\r\nTrying to change her mind \nAnd if I was an airplane pilot \nI wouldn't be 35 thousand \n\nI'd be drawing I'm sorry in the blue sky \n\nOver isle 65\n\n\n\nBut if I was a bettin' man \n\nI'd say she's halfway to Birmingham \n\nOn the phone with her mama n'em \n\nCussing me to hell an back again \n\nI bet she's got a radio on \n\nSinging something 'bout movin' on \n\nI'd put a 100 on her never coming back again \n\nIf I was a bettin' man \n\n\n\nIf I was a radio DJ\n\nWell, I know the songs that I'd play \n\nThey'd be about coming home and making up\n\nAnd falling back in love \n\n\n\nBut if I was a bettin' man\n\nI'd say she's halfway to Birmingham \n\nOn the phone with her mama n'em \n\nAnd cussing me to hell an back again \n\nI bet she's got a radio on \n\nSinging something 'bout movin' on \n\nI'd put a 100 on her never coming back again \n\nIf I was a bettin' man \n\n\n\nIf I was a bettin' man \n\n\n\nIf I was a bettin' man \n\nI wouldn't have folded them winning hands \n\nI wouldn't be sitting here drinkin' beer \n\nWaiting on a second chance\n\n\n\nIf I was a bettin' man \n\nI'd say she's halfway to Birmingham \n\nOn the phone with her mama n'em \n\nAnd cussing me to hell and back again \n\nI bet she's got a radio on\n\nSinging something 'bout movin' on\n\nI'd put a 100 on her never coming back again\n\nIf I was a bettin' man\n\nI'd put a 100 on her never coming back again \n\nIf I was a bettin' man\n\n\n\nA bettin' man"
