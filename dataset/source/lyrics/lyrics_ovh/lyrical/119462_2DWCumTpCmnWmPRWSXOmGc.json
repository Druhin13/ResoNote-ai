Or did you pretend to?\nEvery time you touched me, was it even special ?\nWas I priority ? Or squeezed into schedule\nBaby you angel same time you the devil\n\nAfter all the times, everything we been thru\nEvery time you lie , I always defend you\nWhen I saw you cry, id just hold you gentle\nFor you I prayed to god, to me you like a temple\n\nMusic to my ear you my melody\nLate nights feeling sick you my remedy\nI remember every moment every memory\n\nSipping on you fuck sipping on the hennessy\n\nHave you living in the hills ,out in beverly\nYeah we coulda been forever been a legacy\nBut you tryna fight claiming that we enemies\nThinking bout the jealousy forgetting all chemistry\nX2"
