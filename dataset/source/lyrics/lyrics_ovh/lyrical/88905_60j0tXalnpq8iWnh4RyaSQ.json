  "lyrics": "Everyone's got a lot of love for the boy\r\nSurely he can do no harm if he tried\r\nYou can pull the wool over my eyes so I can't see\r\nBut there ain't no way in hell you're fooling me\r\nEveryone's got a lot of love for the boy\r\nWho can blame them when you see that smile?\n\nYou can take me anywhere you like, but can't you see\n\nThat there ain't no way in hell you're fooling me\n\n\n\nOh, and if I go, will you miss me? I don't think so\n\nI'll just be one less number sitting on your phone\n\nI know they're queuing as far as the eye can see\n\nWell there ain't no way in hell you're fooling me\n\n\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nOoh, ooh, ooh\n\n\n\nOnce he's got you, it's so hard to get out\n\nI could say I told you so but who am I?\n\nWondering why what I feel is such a mystery\n\nI don't know but maybe it's just me\n\n\n\nOh, and if I go, will you miss me? I don't think so\n\nI'll just be one less number sitting on your phone\n\nI know they're queuing as far as the eye can see\n\nWell there ain't no way in hell you're fooling me\n\nNo there ain't no way in hell you're fooling me"
