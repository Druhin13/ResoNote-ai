  "lyrics": "Found a body at the rest stop\r\nBuried in the woods beneath\r\nThe garbage and leaves\r\nWorkers clearing overgrowth\r\nSaw hidden in the brush\r\nJust beyond the line of the trees\n\nA jawbone and teeth\n\nWinter into spring on Fulton Street\n\n\n\nAnd cities grow weeds, and cities grow\n\nAnd cities keep secrets in the trees\n\nIn the shadow of the pyramid\n\nThe cities grow weeds, the cities grow\n\nBy the river and the covered bridge\n\nThe cities grow weeds, I know\n\n\n\nAll the memories your dreams retrieve\n\nPick a dress out for the funeral\n\nHold the vigil in the field, release\n\nLanterns at night and I saw\n\nOn the shoulder of the interstate\n\nWhen I followed your eyes, when I followed your eyes\n\nAll the crosses for the accidents\n\nAll the photos in the flowers by the street\n\n\n\nWill I ever put flowers by the street?\n\nWill I ever put flowers by the street?\n\nNever needed to live and suffer through the pain\n\nAll the tyrannies of grief, if I ever do\n\nWill I even have the strength to do anything?\n\nCould I go and leave flowers by the street?\n\n\n\nAnd I saw signs on the shoulder of the interstate\n\nWhen I followed your eyes\n\nAnd I saw lights fading every monument\n\nAnd the passage of time\n\nIf I could just try, could I banish all the pain in you?\n\nGive you everything you need\n\nIf I hid rose quartz underneath the mattress, would it help your nights\n\nWhen you're struggling to sleep, when you're struggling to sleep\n\nWill I ever be half what I can be?\n\nCan I ever be half what I can be?\n\nIf you needed me to be anything\n\nCould I even be half of what you need?\n\nWill I ever be me? Will I ever be me?\n\nIf I can take hands to shake you, would you want me to?\n\nIf it shook you out of grief, if I gave chase\n\nSummers when you tunneled into nothingness\n\nWould it bring you some release?\n\nIf I saw signs on the shoulder of the interstate\n\nWhen I followed where your eyes went\n\nIf I saw nights spent after midnight in a eulogy\n\nWhich you never got to give\n\nAnd I saw fenders bent hard on an oak tree\n\nAlso sirens at the scene\n\nI saw cigarettes falling in the tangle of machinery\n\nBetween the console and the seat\n\nAnd I saw hands reach, car lurched across the center line\n\nI saw it all in my dreams\n\nAnd I saw leaves hiding bodies in the treeline off the interstate\n\nBut I've never put flowers by the street\n\n\n\nI've never put flowers by the street\n\nIf you need from me, to be anything\n\nI could be everything you need\n\nIf you need from me, to be anything\n\nI could be everything you need\n\nEvery monument, every memory\n\nAnd I've never put flowers by the street"
