  "lyrics": "Am I telling myself the truth?\r\nI'm used to pretending to be strong and clueless\r\nAm I doing this right by you?\r\nI seem to be coming off as wrong and ruthless\r\nAm I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?\n\nIt makes me lose my self-control\n\nI'm staring through the eyes of someone else\n\n\n\nSo I'll keep on smiling on the surface\n\nHiding my nerves behind the curtain\n\nI'm caught up in an empty room\n\nFilled with second thoughts and gloom\n\n\n\nAm I changing my mind again?\n\nAll this indecision makes me shift my focus\n\nIs the tension my only friend?\n\nAnxiety holds my hand when life gets hopeless\n\n\n\nAm I telling myself the truth about what I don't know?\n\nIt makes me lose my self-control\n\nI'm staring through the eyes of someone else\n\n\n\nSo I'll keep on smiling on the surface\n\nHiding my nerves behind the curtain\n\nI'm caught up in an empty room\n\nFilled with second thoughts and gloom\n\n\n\nAm I telling myself the truth about my self-esteem and how others place their worth in me?\n\nI'm staring through the eyes of someone else\n\nAm I telling myself the truth?\n\n\n\nSo I'll keep on smiling on the surface\n\nHiding my nerves behind the curtain\n\nI'm caught up in an empty room\n\nFilled with second thoughts and gloom\n\n\n\nYeah, I'll keep on smiling on the surface\n\n(Am I telling myself the truth?)"
