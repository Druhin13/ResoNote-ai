  "lyrics": "Water towers are made for hearts and names\r\nFriday nights are made for football games\r\nFallin' leaves are made for fallin' in\r\nFront porch steps are made for goodnight kissin'\r\nAnd I was made for you, yeah I was made for you\n\nSummer jobs are made for spendin' cash\n\nSecond dates are made for goin' fast\n\nEarly curfews are made for sneakin' past\n\n2am was made for pissed off dads\n\nAnd I was made for you, yeah I was made for you\n\n\n\nLike a ship without a sea\n\nOr a song without a melody\n\nI don't know where I'd be or what I'd do\n\n'Cause I was made for you\n\n\n\nSmoky bars are made for \"how 'bout a dance?\"\n\nOpen roads are made for holdin' hands and\n\nLaid back seats are made for young love\n\nTwo pink lines are made for growin' up\n\nAnd I was made for you, yeah I was made for you\n\n\n\nLike a ship without a sea\n\nOr a song without a melody\n\nI don't know where I'd be or what I'd do\n\n'Cause I was made for you\n\n\n\nTiny shoes are made for tiny feet\n\nMy two arms are made for where you sleep\n\nSky was made for the moon and stars\n\nYou were made to steal my heart\n\nAnd I was made for you, yeah I was made for you"
