  "lyrics": "I am out, for a walk\r\nAnd I will not be back until they're staining my skin\r\nThis is how I chose to talk with some violent hits\r\nViolent blossoms akin\r\nEvery night I do walk, and if there, looking down not referring my chin\r\nThis is how I chose to talk with some violent hits\n\nViolent blossoms akin\n\n\n\nThat's a way to truly be seen\n\nBy furiously scheming in\n\nForget the jewels\n\nI'm livid, friends are shutting out\n\nFine on their own\n\nBlood on my cheeks, birds come by\n\nOne of my stomps and they fly\n\nPeople politely smile to make sure I wonâ€™t come any closer\n\n\n\nI am out, for a walk\n\nAnd I will not be back until they're staining my skin\n\nThis is how I chose to talk with some violent hits\n\nViolent blossoms akin\n\nEvery night I do walk, and if there, looking down not referring my chin\n\nThis is how I chose to talk with some violent hits\n\nViolent blossoms akin\n\n\n\nNow\n\nA swollen eye is for days\n\nOf curious calm, snow in May\n\nWay better off on my own\n\nSince no one cries there's no one to blame\n\nIt hurts, I feel everything\n\nAs my sense of self's wearing thin\n\nSuch pains can be a delight\n\nFar from when I could drown in my shame\n\n\n\nI am out, for a walk\n\nAnd I will not be back until they're staining my skin\n\nThis is how I chose to talk with some violent hits\n\nViolent blossoms akin\n\nEvery night I do walk, and if there, looking down not referring my chin\n\nThis is how I chose to talk with some violent hits\n\nViolent blossoms akin"
