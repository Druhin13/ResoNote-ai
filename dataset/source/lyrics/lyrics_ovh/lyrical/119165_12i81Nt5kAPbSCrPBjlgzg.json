  "lyrics": "I've been drinking more wine instead of tequila, staying in at home instead of swiping my Visa\r\nAin't running up a tab on a Tuesday night and calling up a cab in the morning light\r\nBeen finding some things I didn't know about me, every wall fell down around me\r\nI didn't go looking, no it just found me, what happened to me 'cause this is the new me\r\nSomebody's got me all f-d up like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning\n\nSomebody's got me calling up my mama, a little nervous saying that I'm falling\n\nSomebody's got me in the palm of their hand like the story was written, all part of God's plan\n\nGot my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve\n\n'Cause somebody's got me, somebody's got me, somebody's got me\n\nSomebody's got me, somebody's got me, somebody's got me\n\n\n\nIs this how it feels to be a man, when I wake up with her wanna do it again\n\nMaking sure she feels safe in my arms, fighting for the flame when you're feeling that spark\n\nSharing the covers to sharing the closet, catching my breath right after I lost it\n\nFrom her walking in to the dress that she's dropping, whatever she wants, oh she's got it\n\n\n\nSomebody's got me all f-d up like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning\n\nSomebody's got me calling up my mama, a little nervous saying that I'm falling\n\nSomebody's got me in the palm of their hand like the story was written, all part of God's plan\n\nGot my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve\n\nOh somebody's got me\n\nOh somebody's got me\n\n\n\nOh somebody's got me all f-d up like I'm three drinks in and the room is spinning\n\nSomebody's got me calling up my mama, a little nervous saying that I'm falling\n\nSomebody's got me in the palm of their hand like the story was written, all part of God's plan\n\nGot my back, got my soul, got my heart on my sleeve\n\nOh somebody's got me\n\nOh yeah, somebody's got me, yeah yeah\n\nOh somebody's got me\n\nOh somebody's got me"
