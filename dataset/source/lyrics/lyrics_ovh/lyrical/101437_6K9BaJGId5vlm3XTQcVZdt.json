Samurai Heart!\n\n\n\nI know that\n\nYou're not listening\n\nYour head is somewhere off in clouds\n\nYou keep ignoring the signs\n\nAnd all my not-so-subtle hints\n\nBut it's always the same\n\nOur two brains\n\nOne wavelength\n\nWait, that's just wishful thinking\n\nI bet you don't even see me\n\nHere standing next to you\n\n\n\nLost in the crowd\n\nBut I'm wandering lonely\n\nFeeling so small\n\nAs I look to the sky\n\nNobody cares that I'm feeling lonely\n\nMore alone as time goes by\n\n\n\nHey! Hey! Can you hear me?\n\nIs anybody there?\n\nWhen will I get an answer?\n\nI'm searching everywhere\n\nHey! Hey! This is my life\n\nAnd my fate's all up to me\n\nWhether I hate or love and smile or cry\n\nThis life I'm living is mine\n\n\n\nDo do do do do do do wa!\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai heart!\n\n\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai Heart!\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai Heart!\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai Heart!\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai Heart!\n\n\n\nAs time is passing\n\nDay by day\n\nIt's all the same\n\nYeah, it's nothing new\n\nAnd it is killing me to know\n\nThat I'll never fit in\n\nThinking out loud, in this crowd\n\nI know I've found\n\nA way to check my footprints\n\nI think I can walk a little more\n\nMore than I did before\n\n\n\nStrolling on by\n\nI pass a glass window\n\nI catch a glimpse\n\nOf something in me\n\nBut I'm so sick and tired of trying\n\nCause this world will never see\n\n\n\nHey! Hey! Can you hear me?\n\nIs anybody there?\n\nWhen will I get an answer?\n\nI'm searching everywhere\n\nHey! Hey! This is my life\n\nAnd my fate's all up to me\n\nIn so deep a small voice hidden in me\n\nAnd now it's breaking free\n\n\n\nHey! Hey! Would you realize\n\nThat you can't do this alone?\n\nYou can't just throw your heart out\n\nAnd hope to fill the hole\n\nHey! Hey! Don't need excuses\n\nCause I'm not giving them yet\n\nI will not run and hide and wither inside\n\nI'm gonna live my life!\n\n\n\nHey! Hey! Can you hear me?\n\nIs anybody there?\n\nWhen will I get an answer?\n\nI'm searching everywhere\n\nHey! Hey! This is my life\n\nAnd my fate's all up to me\n\nWhether I hate or love and smile or cry\n\nThis life I'm living is mine\n\n\n\nHey! Hey!\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai heart!\n\nHey! Hey!\n\n\n\nWhether I hate or love and smile or cry\n\nThis life I'm living is mine\n\n\n\nDo do do do do do do wa!\n\nHey! Hey! Samurai heart!"
