  "lyrics": "All the snow has turned to water\r\nChristmas days have come and gone\r\nBroken toys and faded colors\r\nAre all that's left to linger on\r\nI hate graveyards and old pawn shops\r\nFor they always bring me tears\n\nI can't forgive the way they rob me\n\nOf my childhood souvenirs\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nMemories they can't be boughten\n\nThey can't be won at carnivals for free\n\nWell it took me years\n\nTo get those souvenirs\n\nAnd I don't know how they slipped away from me\n\n\n\nBroken hearts and dirty windows\n\nMake life difficult to see\n\nThat's why last night and this mornin'\n\nAlways look the same to me\n\n\n\nI hate reading old love letters\n\nFor they always bring me tears\n\nI can't forgive the way they rob me\n\nOf my sweetheart's souvenirs\n\n\n\n(Repeat chorus)"
