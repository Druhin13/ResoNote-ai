  "lyrics": "I got a bad habit\r\nSlowly sinking in\r\nGot me hearing voices\r\nSeeing through my skin\r\nWhen a man gives you his hat\r\nHe's living on borrowed time\n\nWhen a man gives you his hat\n\nHe's living on borrowed time\n\nThe shoe fit so I wore it\n\nBut I left one lace untied\n\n\n\nJust a bad habit\n\nOf wanting what I need\n\nI got a bad habit\n\nOf wanting what I need\n\nI may have been born\n\nBut I ain't never been freed\n\nI cry once a day\n\nIt's a condition of the heart\n\nI cry once a day\n\nIt's a condition of the heart\n\nYou're like a puzzle in a box\n\nBut I'm the one coming all apart\n\n\n\nGot a bad habit\n\nYou know the one I mean\n\nI got a bad habit now\n\nYou know the one I mean\n\nNo before no after\n\nOnly in between\n\nIt's a bad habit\n\nBuries me in the dark\n\nGot a bad habit now\n\nBuries me in the dark\n\nUntil the only light is\n\nA match that just won't spark\n\nOnly light, only light"
