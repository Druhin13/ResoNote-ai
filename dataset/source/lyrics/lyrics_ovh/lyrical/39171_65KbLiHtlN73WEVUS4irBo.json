  "lyrics": "[..liquid, you're stepping off of concrete ground and into an element that is always changing and moving and it's surrounding you and it feels good]\r\nYou ride slow\r\nYou don't know anything\r\nI see you now I feel I should go\r\nYou know I know, you can't fool me\n\nEyes open, I see clearly\n\nIt's the weight of the times that is plaguing my mind\n\nIts ironic because history always repeats itself\n\nIt's the wasteful cold wars, debt filled black holes\n\nKeep aching a burning the holes in your pockets\n\nIt's all looks enraging and planned out but I can't\n\nFeel anything\n\nLately I'm trying I'm sorry I'm lying\n\nIt's all just a front to keep you all from talking to me\n\nAbout questions you would ask\n\nBut the answers reside in the past\n\nIt's a headache that awaits me\n\n\n\nIt's a wave that breaks every single day\n\nAnd I hope that you brace yourself for the things you'll feel\n\nAnd the way it swells\n\nCause it's hard to hear or say anything\n\nWhen the surface seems non existent\n\n\n\nAll your friends got new pets\n\nNow they know just how the world ends\n\nHold your feet\n\nIt's hard to breathe\n\nWhen the water rising surrounds all you see\n\nBite your tongue\n\nGrit your teeth\n\nFreedoms coming\n\nJust you wait and see\n\n\n\nIt's a wave that consumes your face\n\nAnd chokes you til you feel okay\n\nAnd I hope that you brace yourself\n\nFor all the ways you're knocked around"
