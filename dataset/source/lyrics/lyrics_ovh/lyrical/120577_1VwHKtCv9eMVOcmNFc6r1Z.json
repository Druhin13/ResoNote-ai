  "title": "My Enemy",
  "lyrics": "I got no more time to hear what you think about me\r\nBecause all your words are so cold, so callous, so clean\r\nIn the moment you could be honest, you could wake up, up\r\nBut your jealousy is more blind than love\r\nAnd you could be my enemy\n\nAnd you could be my judge\n\nIf you could start remembering all the time that you used up\n\nAnd you could be my remedy\n\nIf you could show me love\n\nIf I could stop remembering all the time that you used up\n\n\n\nI got no more time to hear who you think we should blame\n\nBecause all your words are so vile, so vicious, so vain\n\nIn the end, we did all the damage that you could want, want\n\nBut the emptiness will go on and on\n\n\n\nAnd you could be my enemy\n\nAnd you could be my judge\n\nIf you could start remembering all the time that you used up\n\nAnd you could be my remedy\n\nIf you could show me love\n\nIf I could stop remembering all the time that you used up\n\n\n\nAnd you could be my enemy\n\nAnd you could be my judge\n\nIf you could start remembering all the time that you used up\n\nAnd you could be my remedy\n\nIf you could show me love\n\nIf I could stop remembering all the time that you used up"
