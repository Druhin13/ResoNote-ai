  "lyrics": "I have a need\r\nFor solitude\r\nI'll never be\r\nSafe in crowded rooms\r\nI like the sound\r\nOf silence coming on\n\nI come around\n\nWhen everyone has gone\n\n\n\nI have a need\n\nFor cool, verdant spaces\n\nBeneath the trees\n\nSecret empty places\n\nNobody knows\n\nSo no one will intrude\n\nI have a need\n\nFor solitude\n\n\n\nBut you can find me, when the light is changing\n\nAt that time of day when there's\n\nLittle day remaining\n\nYou can find me where I've been waiting\n\nWaiting here for you\n\n\n\nI never was\n\nThe pretty girl in school\n\nI never was\n\nFast, tough and cool\n\nAll I was\n\nAll my life it seems\n\nWas hard to love\n\nHarder now to keep\n\nFound on OldieLyrics.com \n\nBut you can find me, when the light is changing\n\nAt that time of day when there's\n\nLittle day remaining\n\n\n\nI have a need\n\nFor solitude\n\nI'll never be\n\nSafe in crowded rooms\n\nI like the sound\n\nOf silence coming on\n\nI come around when all the rest have gone..."
