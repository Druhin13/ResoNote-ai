  "lyrics": "Cheated and lied, broken so bad\r\nYou made a vow, never get mad\r\nYou play the game, though it's unfair\r\nThey're all the same, who can compare?\r\nFirst you lose trust, then you get worried\n\nNight after night, bar after club\n\nDropping like flies, who woke you up\n\nOn the front lawn, sprinklers turned on\n\nIt's not your house, where'd you go wrong?\n\nFirst you get hurt, then you feel sorry\n\n\n\nFlying like a cannonball, falling to the earth\n\nHeavy as a feather when, you hit the dirt\n\nHow am I the lucky one?, I do not deserve\n\nTo wait around forever when, you were there first\n\nFirst you get hurt, then you feel sorry\n\n\n\nThere comes a time, in a short life\n\nTurn it around, get a rewrite\n\nCall it a dark, night of the soul\n\nTicking of clocks, gravity's pull\n\nFirst you get close, then you get worried\n\n\n\nFlying like a cannonball, falling to the earth\n\nHeavy as a feather when, you hit the dirt\n\nHow am I the lucky one?, I do not deserve\n\nTo wait around forever when, you were there first\n\nFirst you get hurt, then you feel sorry\n\n\n\nYou're going silent, the silent treatment\n\nIt's not inviting now, don't deny what you meant\n\nYou get excited, you get excited\n\nYou got a feel it, oh, at least you can pretend\n\nYou wanna light it, you wanna light it\n\nYou wanna light it now, the candle from both ends\n\nYou get excited, you get excited\n\n\n\nFlying like a cannonball, falling to the earth\n\nHeavy as a feather when, you hit the dirt\n\nHow am I the lucky one?, I do not deserve\n\nTo wait around forever when, you were there first\n\nFlying like a cannonball, falling to the earth\n\nHeavy as a feather when, you hit the dirt\n\nHow am I the lucky one?, I do not deserve\n\nTo wait around forever when, you were there first\n\n\n\nFirst you get close, then you get worried\n\nFirst you get close, then you get worried\n\nFirst you get close, then you get worried\n\nFirst you get close, then you get worried\n\n\n\nYou wanna light it, you wanna light it\n\nYou wanna light it now, the candle from both ends\n\nYou wanna light it, you wanna light it\n\nYou wanna light it now, the candle from both ends"
