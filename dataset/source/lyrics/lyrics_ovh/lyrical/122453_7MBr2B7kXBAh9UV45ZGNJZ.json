  "lyrics": "Wither and bloom\r\nLike we all do soon enough\r\nCover me up with your love\r\nScratches from the branches\r\nWe took our chances, sure enough\r\nI am brambles\n\nBut I am tangled in your love\n\n\n\nBullet holes, bullet holes\n\nAll patched up and headed home\n\nBullet holes, bullet holes\n\nAll patched up and headed home\n\n\n\nSilver and gold\n\nPrecious stones, so I’m told\n\nAh, we’re clutching, but there ain’t nothing we can hold\n\n\n\nBullet holes, bullet holes\n\nAll patched up and headed home\n\nBullet holes, bullet holes\n\nAll patched up and headed home\n\n\n\nDrifting, passing through\n\nUntil we all fall, we all do\n\nIn the meantime, come and cover me up\n\n\n\nI’m all patched up and headed home\n\n(Cover me up with your love) (Bullet holes, bullet holes)\n\nI’m all patched up and headed home\n\nBullet holes, bullet holes\n\nI’m all patched up and headed home\n\n(Cover me up with your love)\n\nI’m all patched up and headed home"
