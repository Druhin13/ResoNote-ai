  "lyrics": "Hold on\r\nJust long enough to watch the pages turn\r\nYou wanted something to see here\r\nYou wanted something that nobody loves\r\nAnd none of us get enough\n\nThere's something dying to live\n\nAnd nothing left here to think about\n\nDestroy the feeling\n\n\n\nOur moment is here and well you can't stop us now\n\nRediscover and shed the skin that's holding us down\n\n\n\nIt's done\n\nYou paid the price for all the ones you burn\n\nNow thereâ€™s only you and me here\n\nWe wanted someone that nobody loves\n\nAnd we finally had enough\n\n\n\nThere's something dying to live\n\nAnd nothing left here to think about\n\nDestroy the feeling\n\n\n\nOur moment is here and well you can't stop us now\n\nRediscover and shed the skin that's holding us down\n\n\n\nThe blood opens eyes\n\nOpens minds set for war\n\nThe moment that we start building walls\n\n\n\nOur moment is here and well you can't stop us now\n\nRediscover and shed the skin that's holding us down\n\n\n\nThe blood opens eyes\n\nOpens minds set for war\n\nThe words tear you down and we keep building walls"
