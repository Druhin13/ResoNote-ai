  "title": "An American Dream",
  "lyrics": "Suffocation. Suffocate with no room to breath. \nForgive us for 'now' is too late. \nThis is not an American dream. \nThis is no longer an American dream. We're trying to breath underwater. \nThe few, the proud, no longer sing their song.\r\nOne nation under God, it's us against the world. \n\nWe've cut the tongue from society, forcing consumption, never hearing ?no.?\n\nWe've brainwashed our children to believe this is destiny. \n\nSpoiled rotten, still counting their 1, 2, 3's.\n\nForgive us for 'now' is too late. \n\nForgive us for fueling the flame. \n\nThis is not an American dream any longer,\n\nas we've become spoiled, rotten, counting our 1, 2, 3's. \n\nDisease infesting our young, beauty has become the beast"
