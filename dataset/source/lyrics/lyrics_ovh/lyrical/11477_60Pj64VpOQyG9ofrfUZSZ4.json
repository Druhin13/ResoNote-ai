  "lyrics": "I'd like to see you in the morning light\r\nI'd like to feel you when it comes tonight\r\nNow I'm here and I'm all alone\r\nStill I know how it feels\r\nI'm alone again\n\nTried so hard to make you see\n\nBut I couldn't find the words\n\nNow the tears, they fall like rain\n\nI'm alone again without you\n\nAlone again without you\n\nAlone again without you\n\nAlone again without you\n\n\n\nI said stay, but you turned away\n\nTried to say that it was me\n\nNow I'm here and I've lost my way\n\nNow I know how it feels\n\nI'm alone again\n\n\n\nTried so hard to make you see\n\nBut I couldn't find the words\n\nNow the tears, they fall like rain\n\nI'm alone again without you\n\n\n\nI...\n\n\n\nTried so hard to make you see\n\nBut I couldn't find the words\n\nNow the tears, they fall like rain\n\nI'm alone again without you"
