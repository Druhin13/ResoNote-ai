  "lyrics": "she wakes up in her bed\nthe peaceful morning light\nhas banished all the shadows and she feels so alive\n\nshe gets up on her feet\nthe old morning routine\n\nbut today, she knows, is special and it's special indeed \n\n\n\nshe starts her way to school\n\nthe clocks ticking away\n\nwhen every second's precious there's no reason to wait\n\n\n\nshe steps out on the road\n\nit only takes a step\n\nbut something else is coming and there's no going back\n\n\n\nit's coming far too fast\n\nand something in her breaks as she smashes to the ground\n\n\n\ni think these wounds will last\n\nand i know she's not dead but she's barely alive\n\n\n\nand i can't shake the feeling\n\nthat death is lurking closer than we realize"
