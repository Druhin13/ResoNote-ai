  "lyrics": "To see within is to feel without a light\r\nWho'd have thought that we'd break the things we like?\r\nTo find a stone just to bounce across the pond\r\nIs the path it makes that's a clue to other songs\r\nHer hair curls in the damp of the night\n\nThe scent recalls like a photograph with life\n\nHer hair, it curls in the depth of the night\n\nThe scent recalls like a photograph with life\n\n\n\nTo live without is to live under a spell\n\nWho'd have thought that we'd turn our home to hell?\n\nTo find a bone and float it down the stream\n\nIt's the path it takes that's a clue to many greens\n\n\n\nHer hair curls in the damp of the night\n\nThe scent recalls like a photograph with life\n\nHer woolen coat under yellow sodium lights\n\nRecords the air like a memory of night\n\nHer hair, it curls in the damp of the night\n\nThe scent recalls like a photograph with life\n\nHer woolen coat under yellow sodium lights\n\nRecords the air like a memory of night"
