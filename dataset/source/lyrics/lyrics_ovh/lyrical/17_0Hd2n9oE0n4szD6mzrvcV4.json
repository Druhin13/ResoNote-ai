  "lyrics": "Thrown out of the bar, can't find your car\r\nSwear somebody stole your keys\r\nDrunk and alone, trying to get home\r\nYou need a friend like me\r\nNothing sticks if you give up too quick\n\nYou end up on your knees\n\nYou're afraid of the dark, it's cold in your heart\n\nYou need a friend like me\n\n\n\nYou don't have to settle down\n\nI want you how you are right now\n\nI know you wanna fix it all\n\nBut who's gonna catch you when you fall?\n\nAnd I need you\n\nBut you need me, too\n\nMaybe you don't believe\n\nI think you need a friend like me\n\n\n\nYou're lost in the crowd, so you hid in the clouds\n\nBut I can always see\n\nWho you are, and you've come so far\n\nYou need a friend like me\n\n\n\nTo hold you closer, let you know I'm here\n\n\n\nYou don't have to settle down\n\nI want you how you are right now\n\nI know you wanna fix it all\n\nBut who's gonna catch you when you fall?\n\nAnd I need you\n\nBut you need me, too\n\nMaybe you don't believe\n\nI think you need a friend like me\n\n\n\nI'll hold you closer, don't you know I'm here?\n\n\n\nYou don't have to settle down\n\nI want you how you are right now\n\nI know you wanna fix it all\n\nBut who's gonna catch you when you fall?\n\nYou don't have to change your mind\n\nI'm gonna wear you down in time\n\nWe may never get it right\n\nBut sure as hell I'm gonna try\n\n'Cause I need you\n\nAnd you need me too\n\nYeah, you can count on me\n\n'Cause I'm a friend indeed\n\nEven if you don't believe\n\nYou need a friend like me"
