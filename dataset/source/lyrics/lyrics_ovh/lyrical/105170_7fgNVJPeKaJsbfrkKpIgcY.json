  "lyrics": "I got money cause I work all day\r\nDon't get down, I’m a mile away\r\nWhen evening comes, I go call up the band\r\nWe play religious music, don't think you'd understand man\r\nWell, hear me Paul, I will stick around\n\nI'm the baddest, stoniest thing in town\n\nGive me eighteen, man, but they speak another tongue\n\nThey left me there, but the dead men have no fun\n\n\n\nTruth it’s not my fault, yeah love came over me\n\nDear! Dear! If you love war, then you got war with me\n\nThey looked him straight and told him I'm in town\n\nNow, now, feeling good, somehow\n\n\n\nEight days down, we stick around\n\nPhilip, what’s up, I need you bad now\n\nThink “my God, I can hardly dream”\n\nIf you don't like that, well you told me not to brag, but I said\n\n\n\nYeah hear me Paul, and I’ll fight aboveground\n\nThey left me there, fill me up when I’m down\n\nDear! Kill off my father, yeah love came over me\n\nDear! Dear! If you want war, then you got war with me\n\nWell, way I was brought up, we were told things never to tell\n\nBitter, beaten down, stop! They don't know, kick em down\n\nFame!\n\nFor a while I had no way out, yeah man\n\nNot now, not now, catch it now\n\n\n\nThey said that I should move on from here\n\nCombed out my hair, started out, and my dreams took half a drag\n\nCan't tell my poor mind to leave me, yeah I can't catch a break\n\nYou weren't much a man to me, but you're the only one I've ever had"
