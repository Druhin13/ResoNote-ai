  "lyrics": "Our conversation was short and sweet\r\nIt nearly swept me off-a my feet.\r\nAnd I'm back in the rain, oh, oh,\r\nAnd you are on dry land.\r\nYou made it there somehow\r\nYou're a big girl now.\n\n\n\nBird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence,\n\nHe's singin' his song for me at his own expense.\n\nAnd I'm just like that bird, oh, oh,\n\nSingin' just for you. \n\nI hope that you can hear,\n\nHear me singin' through these tears.\n\n\n\nTime is a jet plane, it moves too fast\n\nOh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last.\n\nI can change, I swear, oh, oh,\n\nSee what you can do.\n\nI can make it through,\n\nYou can make it too.\n\n\n\nLove is so simple, to quote a phrase,\n\nYou've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days.\n\nOh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh,\n\nIn somebody's room.\n\nIt's a price I have to pay\n\nYou're a big girl all the way.\n\n\n\nA change in the weather is known to be extreme\n\nBut what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?\n\nI'm going out of my mind, oh, oh,\n\nWith a pain that stops and starts\n\nLike a corkscrew to my heart\n\nEver since we've been apart."
