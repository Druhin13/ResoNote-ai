  "lyrics": "I'm getting in with the wrong crowd\r\nI'm talking too loud\r\nI think I'm starting to get people down\r\nAnd when I talk about it too much\r\nI think they lose touch\r\nAnd then I bury my head in the ground\n\n\n\nOh baby how'd you let me get here\n\nYou said you'd stay here\n\nBut it feels like you're never around\n\nAnd every time I try to stand up\n\nI put my hands up\n\n\n\nOh have you looked at me lately?\n\n\n\nOh oh oh baby oh oh oh\n\nDon't forget me, forget me\n\nThis is not how we were meant to be\n\nI'm running on empty\n\n\n\nI bought two tickets for the rodeo\n\nJust so you know\n\nI think I'm tryna get back in your head\n\nFor all the times you said you knew me\n\nYou looked right through me\n\nWhile another man lies in my bed\n\n\n\nOh baby look at how you made me\n\nI'm going crazy\n\nIs this really how you want it to be\n\nAnd every time I try to stand up\n\nI put my hands up\n\n\n\nOh have you looked at me lately?\n\n\n\nOh oh oh baby oh oh oh\n\nDon't forget me, forget me\n\nThis is not how we were meant to be\n\nI'm running on empty\n\n\n\nOh oh oh baby oh oh oh\n\nDon't forget me, forget me\n\nThis is not how we were meant to be\n\nI'm running"
