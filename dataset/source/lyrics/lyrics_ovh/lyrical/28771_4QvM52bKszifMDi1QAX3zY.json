  "lyrics": "I was hot as a burning dragon on a cross\r\nAnd I knew my body wanted you\r\nWe were barely clothed in Egyptian robes\r\nIs it love or just a screw?\r\nShe descends from the stairs of an ancient lair, with two cats at her feet\r\nHer electric pouncer couldn't weigh an ounce\n\nBut she managed to conquer me\n\n\n\nI've waited long enough, now I have you\n\nUnder the sheets in my room,\n\nthere's my body, just a tomb for the girls that I've had in the past\n\n\n\nDrenched in sweat in a skeleton hat\n\nDress covered in bright red ink\n\nIt was fun for awhile but I knew it wouldn't last\n\nThe summer was dead to me\n\n\n\nI've waited long enough, now I have you\n\nUnder the sheets in my room,\n\nthere's my body, just a tomb for the girls that I've had in the past\n\n\n\nI've waited long enough, now I have you\n\nUnder the sheets in my room,\n\nthere's my body, just a tomb for the girls that I've had in the past\n\n\n\nHow could you not realize it was me?\n\nAll of the turquoise jewelry you've received\n\nHow could you not realize it was me?\n\nAll of the turquoise jewelry you've received\n\nAh, ah, ah, ah\n\nHow could you not realize it was me?\n\nAll of the turquoise jewelry you've received\n\nAh (14x)\n\n\n\nI've waited long enough, now I have you\n\nUnder the sheets in my room,\n\nthere's my body, just a tomb for the girls that I've had in the past\n\n\n\nI've waited long enough, now I have you\n\n\n\n(Thanks to sarah for these lyrics)"
