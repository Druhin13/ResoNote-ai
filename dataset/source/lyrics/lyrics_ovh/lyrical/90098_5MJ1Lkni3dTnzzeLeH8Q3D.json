  "lyrics": "It was a Monday\r\nA day like any other day\r\nI left a small town\r\nFor the Apple in decay\r\nIt was my destiny\n\nIt's what we needed to do\n\nThey were telling me\n\nI'm telling you\n\n\n\nI was inside looking outside\n\nThe millions of faces\n\nBut still I'm alone\n\nWaiting, hours of waiting\n\nPaying a penance\n\nI was longing for home\n\n\n\nI'm looking out for the two of us\n\nI hope we'll be here when they're through with us\n\n\n\nI was inside looking outside\n\nOh the millions of faces\n\nBut still I'm alone\n\nWaiting, hours of waiting\n\nI could feel the tension\n\nI was longing for home\n\n\n\nI'm looking out for the two of us\n\nAnd I hope we'll be here when they're through with us\n\nI'm long way from home\n\n\n\nMonday, sad, sad Monday\n\nShe's waiting for me\n\nBut I'm a long, long way from home\n\n\n\nSad, sad Monday\n\nShe's waiting for me\n\nBut I'm a long, long way from home\n\n\n\nSad, sad Monday\n\nOh she's waiting for me\n\nBut I'm a long, long way from home"
