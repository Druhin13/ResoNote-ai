Still keep it G while meeting up with executives\n\n(What else?) My boy said tell the story how you made it out\n\nHow the pen and the pad had it written down\n\nHow I use to skip class ‘cause the teacher really couldn't teach me much\n\nFailed the class summer school got the same teacher, bruh\n\nMy flow been unorthodox\n\nI underscore\n\nPlease understand the undertaker still coming for, you\n\nFern\n\n\n\nWe're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah uh I just wanna leave right now, can we go\n\nI just wanna leave right now, can we go\n\nCan we go\n\n\n\nYeah uh Feel like I don't belong here\n\nHappy you ain’t gone yet\n\nI don't feed the nonsense\n\nYoung Marty killing everything before the contract\n\nHad to leave Nordstrom, it was slowing down my progress\n\nI thought if I made it I would be happier\n\nFriends started acting weird saying that I’m Hollywood\n\nDepression in my mind saying I should quit\n\nBut I’m not here because I failed, I'm here because I didn't\n\nYeah, still living one day at a time\n\nDon’t care about your top 5 when most of mine are gone\n\nThings changed, I'm a different type of artist\n\nTry to put my friends on, but I lost some in the process\n\nStill underrated, our last album had some pop hits\n\n10 projects down, and we're still just getting started\n\nYeah still just getting started, if I die tonight I hope I go out as a martyr yeah\n\nWhen you leave will they miss you\n\nOn the road to Heaven, nobody goes with you"
