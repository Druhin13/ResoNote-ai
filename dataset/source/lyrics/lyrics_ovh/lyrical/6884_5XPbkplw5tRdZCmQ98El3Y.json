  "lyrics": "Don't ever look to the sun\r\nHe will burn your eyes with the fire of his light\r\nAnd never pray in the house of\r\nEternal sight where the spirit goes to die\r\nSo now we stand up and again we cry for the passion of his name\r\nIt's where we love, where we hate\n\nIt's the price we pay when our love is out of time\n\n\n\nWhere is the spark that won't fade away?\n\nAnd where is the queen to my king of pain?\n\n\n\nSay my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow in the night\n\nLove and fear cannot win the fight\n\nEven with the an army behind your life\n\nSo don't walk away, I'll keep you safe, forget promises that we made\n\nSay my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow here tonight\n\n\n\nWhen we find what we need from these\n\nBroken hearts and what was missing from the start\n\nSpeak the words of a God that\n\nRefuse to lie to a believer then won't try\n\nI want to give up as my vision fades. [?] now I'm blind\n\nDon't let me go to the desert that I left\n\nBehind with the ashes of a fate that died\n\n\n\nWhere is the spark that won't fade away?\n\nAnd where is the queen to my king of pain?\n\n\n\nSay my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow in the night\n\nLove and fear cannot win the fight\n\nEven with the an army behind your life\n\nSo don't walk away, I'll keep you safe, forget promises that we made\n\nSay my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow here tonight\n\n\n\nI cannot see what's become of life\n\nIt's all just passing by\n\nI cannot see what's become of life\n\nIt's all just passing by, yeah\n\n\n\nSay my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow in the night\n\nLove and fear cannot win the fight\n\nEven with the an army behind your life\n\nSo don't walk away, I'll keep you safe, forget promises that we made\n\nSay my name, never leave your side, I will be your shadow here tonight"
