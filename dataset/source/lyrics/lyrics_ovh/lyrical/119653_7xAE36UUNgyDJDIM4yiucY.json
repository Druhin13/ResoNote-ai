Wonder if you even notice me and\n\n(Oh..) You gotta feel me\n\n(And I...) Would love you good.\n\n(Just wanna be your girl)\n\n\n\nAll alone at night\n\nI habor feelings for you\n\nHolding my pillow tight\n\nSometimes I even touch myself\n\nImagining your pleasure baby.\n\n\n\nNext time I see you I'm \n\nGonna walk right up to you and\n\nSay what's on my mind\n\nI gotta make you see, this is\n\n(More) than just a silly crush\n\n\n\n(And I...) Wonder if you even notice me and\n\n(Oh..) You gotta feel me\n\n(And I...) Would love you good.\n\n(Just wanna be your girl)\n\n\n\nI wonder if you even notice me\n\nOoh you gotta feel me\n\nI would love you good\n\n(Just wanna be) (Just wanna be)\n\n(Just wanna be) your girl\n\n(And I...) Wonder if you even notice me and\n\n(Oh..) You gotta feel me\n\n(And I...) Would love you good.\n\n(Just wanna be your girl)"
