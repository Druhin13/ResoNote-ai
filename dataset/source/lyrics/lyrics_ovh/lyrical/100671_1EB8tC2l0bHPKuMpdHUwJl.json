  "lyrics": "It's not enough is it? It's not enough\r\nWhat do you want, what do you want?\r\nYou want my blood? Do you want my sweat?\r\nWhat the fuck you want? What the fuck y'all niggas want?\r\nLace front, time to show 'em bitches always talkin' shit\n\n'Bout they pissed, bitch, go fix your wig\n\nI ain't comin' in the game to play no victim\n\nI tell bitches suck dick before I play the victim\n\nWho me? Yes you, who you think I'm talking to?\n\nDon't think 'cause I'm like that, I won't get dark\n\nBitch bark, but I bite, let's see who rides tonight\n\nI let her eat the pussy then I fuck her up on site\n\nIf you really want problems I'll be Dennis The Menace\n\nSerena Williams hittin' 'em with the racket 'til I bend it\n\nYou want sex? I sell it\n\nYou want beef? Then leg it\n\nHow you gon' run up your gums and not come see the dentist?\n\n\n\nYou lil' bitch, always talking 'bout a couple comments\n\nYou lil' bitch, always fucking with my fucking money\n\nLil' bitch, I'ma show you how to pay me homage\n\nLil' bitch, Don Dodda comin' and they runnin' like a bitch\n\n\n\nYou know I'm the shit, you know I write them hits\n\nYou know I always keep a rummy on me, I'm lit\n\nYou ain't with the shits, boy you talking shit\n\nUntil I hit the goons and tell em hit em with the stick\n\nBitch I'm with the clique, pull up and they tip\n\nBitches say their pussy lit but I heard it stink\n\nBars trappin' with the clique, they be on that heroin\n\nOne minute they love you but they don't wanna see you win\n\n\n\nYou lil' bitch, always talking 'bout a couple comments\n\nYou lil' bitch, always fucking with my fucking money\n\nLil' bitch, I'ma show you how to pay me homage\n\nLil' bitch, Don Dodda comin' and they runnin' like a bitch"
