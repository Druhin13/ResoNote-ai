  "lyrics": "All alone at the end of the evening\r\nAnd the bright lights have faded to blue\r\nI was thinking 'bout a woman\r\nWho might have loved me, and I never knew\r\nYou know I've always been a dreamer\n\n(Spent my life running 'round)\n\nAnd it's so hard to change\n\n(Can't seem to settle down)\n\nBut the dreams I've seen lately\n\nKeep on turning out and burning out\n\nAnd turning out the same\n\n\n\nSo put me on a highway\n\nAnd show me a sign\n\nAnd take it to the limit one more time\n\n\n\nYou can spend all your time making money\n\nYou can spend all your love making time\n\nIf it all fell to pieces tomorrow\n\nWould you still be mine?\n\n\n\nAnd when you're looking for your freedom\n\n(Nobody seems to care)\n\nAnd you can't find the door\n\n(Can't find it anywhere)\n\nWhen there's nothing to believeÂ in\n\nStill you're coming back, you're running back\n\nYou're coming back for more\n\n\n\nSo put me on a highway\n\nAnd show me a sign\n\nAnd take it to the limit one more time\n\n\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nOne more time\n\n\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nOne more time\n\n\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nOne more time\n\n\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nOne more time\n\n\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nOne more time\n\n\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nTake it to the limit\n\nOne more time"
