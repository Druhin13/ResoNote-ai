  "lyrics": "We can stumble in and out of love\r\nI can never seem to call it fun\r\nBut I'll try, try, try\r\nI'll try, try, try\r\nI'll try to make it alright\n\n\n\nWe played lovers in the fallin' rain\n\nYou can't tell me that it's just a game\n\n\n\nSo you'll try, try, try\n\nYou'll try, try, try\n\n\n\nOh, I found a new way\n\nTo die\n\nIt's hidden in your tear stained eyes\n\n\n\nOh, I never wanna hear you say\n\nSay it like I did that day\n\nWhat love's over now\n\nThat love is over now\n\n\n\nSo I'll try, try, try\n\nI'll try, try, try\n\n\n\nOh, I found a new way\n\nTo die\n\nIt's hidden in your eyes\n\nOh, I- I found a new way\n\nTo die\n\nIt's hidden in your tear stained eyes"
