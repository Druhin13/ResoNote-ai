  "lyrics": "Born from silence, silence full of it\r\nA perfect concert my best friend\r\nSo much to live for, so much to die for\r\nIf only my heart had a home\r\nSing what you can't say\n\nForget what you can't play\n\nHasten to drown into beautiful eyes\n\nWalk within my poetry, this dying music\n\n- My loveletter to nobody\n\n\n\nNever sigh for better world\n\nIt's already composed, played and told\n\nEvery thought the music I write\n\nEverything a wish for the night\n\n\n\nWrote for the eclipse, wrote for the virgin\n\nDied for the beauty the one in the garden\n\nCreated a kingdom, reached for the wisdom\n\nFailed in becoming a god\n\n\n\nNever sigh...\n\n\n\n\"If you read this line, remember not the hand that wrote it\n\nRemember only the verse, songmaker's cry the one without tears\n\nFor I've given this its strength and it has become my only strength.\n\nComforting home, mother's lap, chance for immortality\n\nwhere being wanted became a thrill I never knew\n\nThe sweet piano writing down my life\"\n\n\n\n\"Teach me passion for I fear it's gone\n\nShow me love, hold the lorn\n\nSo much more I wanted to give to the ones who love me\n\nI'm sorry\n\nTime will tell (this bitter farewell)\n\nI live no more to shame nor me nor you\n\nAnd you... I wish I didn't feel for you anymore...\"\n\n\n\nA lonely soul\n\nAn ocean soul"
