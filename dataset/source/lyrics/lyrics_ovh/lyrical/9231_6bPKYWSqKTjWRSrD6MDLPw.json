No you're not on your own\n\nJust a minute alone would do\n\n\n\nA little bit of disrespect could be\n\nAnother way to break the ordinary\n\nIt's all too fancy, no it's not for me\n\nNo more bragging already\n\nTill you got something to say\n\n\n\nOn\n\nWe're meant to get it on\n\nWe're meant to get it on\n\nWe're meant to get it on\n\n\n\nFior di latte, fior di latte\n\nThrow your weight around behind me\n\nFior di latte, fior di latte\n\nDon't think about it, trigger me happy\n\n\n\nAll other acts are for idiots\n\nCome on come on come and provide it\n\nLet's be quiet and wrap it up\n\nGive me your fior di latte\n\n\n\nOn\n\nWe're meant to get it on\n\nWe're meant to get it on\n\nWe're meant to get it on"
