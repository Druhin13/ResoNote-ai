  "lyrics": "Keeping up appearances, don't break now\r\nWe're buckled from the weight\r\nPretend to laugh, but don't laugh too loud\r\nDo you feel the pressure building?\r\nThe anger spilling out now\n\nMeanwhile, the cracks have formed on the masks we've worn up 'til now\n\n\n\nWe are far from perfect\n\nBut perfect as we are\n\nWe are bruised, we are broken\n\nBut we are goddamn works of art\n\nWorks of art\n\n\n\nPieces of our hearts are gravitating together but\n\nBefore we could be part of this mosaic\n\n\n\nWe had to break apart like glass\n\nWe're falling faster than stars\n\nMeanwhile, the cracks have formed on the masks we've worn up 'til now\n\n\n\nTake a look\n\nWe are far from perfect\n\nBut perfect as we are\n\nWe are bruised, we are broken\n\nBut we are goddamn works of art\n\n\n\nWith every colour, we shine!\n\nA tapestry of scars!\n\nWithout regret we're\n\nGrowing stronger and moving onward\n\nFinding right ways, despite the wrong ones\n\nWe're clearing paths, we're locked by storms\n\nWe're finding the beauty\n\nIn what you've ignored\n\n\n\nWe are far from perfect\n\nBut perfect as we are\n\nWe are far from perfect\n\nWe're perfect as we are\n\nWe are bruised, we are broken\n\nBut we are goddamn works of art\n\nYeah, we are perfect as we are\n\nPerfect as we are"
