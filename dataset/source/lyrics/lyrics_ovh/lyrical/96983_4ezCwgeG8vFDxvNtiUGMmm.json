  "lyrics": "I wish I had a third floor motel room\r\nOn the dark side of the moon\r\nUp there with the satellites in the sky\r\nIf you knew anything about her, you'd understand why\r\nI used to believe in love\r\nAnd all that forever stuff\n\nBut now I'm startin' to think it was only lies\n\nIf you knew anything her, you'd understand why\n\n\n\nShe's a sailor on the coast in stormy weather\n\nShe's that C22, go-to jukebox song\n\nI had small town dreams of us together\n\nBut now she's gone\n\n\n\nI don't dance with 90 proof\n\nOr smoke weed like I used to\n\nBut right now I sure could use the high\n\nIf you knew anything about her, you'd understand why, yeah\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah she's that sailor on the coast in stormy weather\n\nShe's that C22, go-to jukebox song\n\nI had small town dreams of us together\n\nBut now she's gone\n\n\n\nI wish I had a third floor motel room\n\nOn the dark side of the moon\n\nUp there with the satellites in the sky\n\nIf you knew anything about her, you'd understand why\n\nIf you knew anything about her\n\nYou'd understand why"
