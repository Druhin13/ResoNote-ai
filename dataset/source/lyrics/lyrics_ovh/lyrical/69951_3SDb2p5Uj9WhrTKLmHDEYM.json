  "lyrics": "There was a time when I was younger and naïve\r\nI thought we'd both be living forever, December\r\nYou used to tell me not to worry about my fears\r\nAs I grow old I’ll learn to defeat them, defeat them\r\nI swear you said you were coming home\n\nBut the pain inside, it just took you away from me\n\nYou swore that you would make amends\n\nWith the way you left, will the memories ever end?\n\n\n\nAs we grew older you grew distant and afraid\n\nLike your head was caving in under pressure, September\n\n\n\nYou left with the summer, let my world unfold\n\nI'll always be burdened by the fears that I hold\n\nBut you said I’d defeat them\n\nWill the memories ever end?\n\n\n\nI swear you said you were coming home\n\nBut the pain inside, it just took you away from me\n\nYou swore that you would make amends\n\nWith the way you left, will the memories ever end?\n\n\n\nYou'll know someday why I just couldn't stay\n\nWhy I was taken away\n\nYou'll learn one day that I made the mistake\n\nOf trading everything that I ever loved for feelings I can't fake\n\nFor things I couldn't replace\n\nBut I pray that you could learn to forgive me\n\nI swear that I’ll change\n\n\n\nI swear you said you were coming home\n\nBut the pain inside, it just took you away from me\n\nYou swore that you would make amends\n\nWith the way you left, will the memories ever end?"
