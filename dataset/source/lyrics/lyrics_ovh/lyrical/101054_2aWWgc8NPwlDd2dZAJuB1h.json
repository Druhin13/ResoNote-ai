  "lyrics": "Cool me\r\nCool my fever high\r\nHold me when I cry\r\nI need it so much\r\nMakes you want to get down and crawl like a beggar\r\nFor its touch\n\nAnd all the while it's free as air\n\nLike plants the medicine is everywhere\n\n\n\nLove\n\nLove\n\nLove\n\n\n\nWe crave it so badly\n\nMakes you want to laugh out loud when you receive it\n\nAnd gobble it like candy\n\n\n\nWe think it's easy\n\nSometimes it's easy\n\nBut it's not easy\n\nYou're going to break down and cry\n\nWe're not important\n\nWe should be grateful\n\nAnd if you're wondering why\n\n\n\nLove\n\nLove\n\nLove\n\n\n\nThe price that we pay\n\nWhen evil walks the planet\n\nAnd love is crushed like clay\n\nThe master races, the chosen peoples\n\nThe burning temples, the weeping cathedrals"
