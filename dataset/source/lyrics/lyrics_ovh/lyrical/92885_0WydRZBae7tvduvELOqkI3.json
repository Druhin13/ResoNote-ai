  "lyrics": "Remember that feel of my hands running through your hair on your bedroom floor\r\nCaught in the thrill of a life spending cash on shit that we can't afford\r\nNo this ain’t the end, no I'm not dissuaded by your demeanor\r\nAnd if you forget, the memories fade, I'll be your timekeeper\r\nCause I want you more\r\nOh baby, I want you more\n\n\n\nShow you that first date at the ramen place\n\nWhen I picked you up late, we were happy that day\n\nYou told me about your family, how they hate all your decisions\n\nBut you never felt it heavy, and you still had vision\n\nShow you that first night when we just had sex\n\nWhen your eyes rolled back to the back of your head\n\nBut now you’re so damn mean is it a cultural thing?\n\nGuess that you forgot that night when you called me a dream, heavy\n\n\n\nAnd you cannot even tell me what's the reason\n\nBut you're addicted to a loneliness, that feeling\n\n(Those flowers didn't help, huh?)\n\nYou say it's in your head, you blame the seasons\n\n(Shit I hate this cold too)\n\nBut your addicted to a sadness to that feeling\n\n(Whatever, just stay on your phone)\n\n\n\nShow you that first fight at Hodges Bend\n\nWhen we talked it all out, sealed it up in a kiss\n\nBut then you had another drink, said you could not feel it\n\nUntil you threw that glass at me, when you saw I looked at him (Fuck)\n\nJealousy is quite a bitch, and you thought that I was joking when I offered the hitch\n\nI don't need all the memories to know we're A-team\n\nAnd if you can't see that, then fucking leave babe\n\n\n\nAnd you cannot even tell me what’s the reason\n\n(Goodbye RK)\n\nBut you’re addicted to a loneliness, that feeling\n\n(Guess I'll see you another day)\n\nYou say it’s in your head, you blame the seasons\n\n(And to RB, too)\n\nBut you're addicted to a sadness to that feeling\n\n(Just keep that focus on you)"
