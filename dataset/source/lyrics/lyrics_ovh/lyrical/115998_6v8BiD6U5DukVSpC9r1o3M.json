  "lyrics": "I read your letter and tears filled my eyes\r\nAll of your promises fading, was nothing but lies\r\nSo I turned your photograph over, face to the wall\r\nAnd when I dim the lights in my room tonight\r\nTeardrops will fall\n\nTeardrops will fall tonight\n\nTears I can't hide\n\nTears that I tried to keep\n\nDeep down inside\n\nTears fall, a love that's gone\n\nBeyond recall\n\nAnd when I dim the lights in my room tonight\n\nTeardrops will fall\n\n\n\nI'm gonna pray tonight, baby\n\nHoping you will hear\n\nMaybe you'll right the wrong, now\n\nAnd dry each tear\n\nI'll sit alone tonight hoping you will call\n\nAnd when I dim the lights in my room tonight\n\nTeardrops will fall"
