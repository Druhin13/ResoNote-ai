(tell me, tell me, tell me)\r\nOoh, darling, ha—I got nothing to lose (tell me, tell me, tell me)\r\nNothing to lose (nothing to lose)\n\nI got nothing to prove\n\nNothing to you (ooh)\n\n\n\nMovin' at a mile a minute\n\nSet the pace, I'm goin' over the limit\n\nAlways wondered what I've been missin'\n\nThe chequered flag doesn't mean that you're finished, oh\n\nI got everything that I wanted\n\nI built myself a house on the hill\n\nAll my passion fulfilled, saw it fast like a film\n\nAll that sadness and guilt, now I just wanna chill\n\nBut I can't, my suntans in Thailand\n\nSwimming on a cloud made of hands\n\nMoney in my pockets, Louis wallet in my pants\n\nNo AC in the crib but I got plenty of fans\n\nSaid \"I love you\" too soon\n\nReached for the stars and I hit the moon\n\nNow every time I look at you\n\nFeels like déjà vu, oh\n\n\n\nLiving in a dream\n\nWhere everybody loves me (everybody loves me)\n\nLiving in a dream world\n\nHow'd I get so lucky? (how'd I get so)\n\nSo tell me how you feel\n\n\n\nUh, I feel like a legend in these Puma suedes\n\nI'ma still make millions when this music fade\n\nReinvent every time the music change\n\nMy gut had me feeling like I knew the way\n\nI feel like I spoke for my generation\n\nAll game and my demonstration\n\nTo my gang, I'm a different greatness\n\nPay dues, never missed a payment\n\nStay true, now it's entertainment\n\nFeel like I'm built for whatever storm\n\nWhatever way the game test me, in whatever form\n\nWar in dark times that they never saw\n\nI feel like I stand tall and can never fall (yeah)\n\nI feel like a one on one (alright)\n\nLike the last dope boy in the game with a hunnid tons (yeah)\n\n2Pac got the troublesome, a boozy bad-ass\n\nDrop a bag on you niggas if I want it done\n\n\n\nLiving in a dream\n\nWhere everybody loves me (everybody loves me)\n\nLiving in a dream world\n\nHow'd I get so lucky? (how'd I get so)\n\nSo tell me how you feel\n\n\n\nNow the war is over\n\nCan't get any older\n\n20/20 vision"
