  "lyrics": "It feels like 1960\r\nThis pool we’re swimming in is empty\r\nI’ve got mirrors on my ceiling\r\nSing it to you in your bedroom\r\nFill your head with this lovely, dark, tune\r\nAnd I promise that you'll like it\n\nPromise that you'll like it\n\nI promise that you'll like it\n\n\n\nIn the darkest of dens\n\nIs where we will fit in\n\nDon't underestimate my capability\n\nTo be your favorite sin\n\nDo you think about what I think about?\n\nOur chemicals mixed with nicotine\n\nI'm the cancer in your lungs\n\nSo just give up and inhale me\n\n\n\nI'm addicted to the way you smell\n\nAnd the way you make me feel like hell\n\nIs a place I wouldn't mind to be\n\nIf you were there with me\n\nAnd you can have what's left of me\n\nI'll do my best to remain in one piece\n\nAnd I promise that you'll like it\n\nPromise that you'll like it\n\nI promise that you'll like it\n\n\n\nDarkest of dens\n\nIs where we will fit in\n\nDon't underestimate my capability\n\nTo be your favorite sin\n\nDo you think about what I think about?\n\nOur chemicals mixed with nicotine\n\nI'm the cancer in your lungs\n\nSo just give up"
