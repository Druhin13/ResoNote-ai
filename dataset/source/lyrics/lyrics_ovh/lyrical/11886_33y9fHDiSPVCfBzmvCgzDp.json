I age, and I wait\r\nFor the hands I used to call my home\n\n\n\nLean on trees just like a shoulder\n\nSee you in young West Point soldiers\n\nYeah I’ll wait right here as I get older\n\nCause the weight’s right here all on my shoulders…\n\n\n\nThe weight of love: Forever gone, like the chest\n\nI leaned on and on and on and on and on…\n\n\n\nBut I’ll wait on your shoulders\n\n\n\nWait right here as I get older cause the weights right here\n\nAll on my shoulders"
