  "lyrics": "I'd like to tell you a story about\r\nWhat one dance can do\r\nOne dance can do\r\nOne dance can do\r\nA listen up\n\n\n\nAfter one dance on the floor\n\nShe came back, wanting for more, for more\n\nNow I don't know what it is that I've got\n\nWhat she whispered it was so nice, so nice\n\nBut her man is sitting across the way\n\nAnd he could hear the things I say\n\nNow he watches from the corner of his eyes\n\nSo a move like this would be so unwise\n\n\n\nOoh ooh, he's standing ina my way\n\nStanding in my way hey\n\n\n\nYou could see\n\nShe was more than ready\n\nTo make the move with me anytime\n\nNot even thinking of the consequences, oh no no\n\nSo I had to think quickly\n\nCause her man his face was looking oh so mean\n\nAs if anytime, he could create a scene\n\nSo gently I pushed her away\n\nOoh ooh, he wants to spoil the play\n\n\n\nHe's standing in my way, hey\n\nHe's standing in my way\n\n\n\nNow I understand how he feels\n\nBut I wish he'd give me a little room\n\nI know he's got himself a raw deal\n\nbut I'd like to leave with this lady soon\n\nI didn't mean, to be so unkind\n\nBut I had more than two but one was looking fine\n\nBig spender he was, had to have his own way\n\nThought he'd leave, but he stayed\n\n\n\nStill standing in my way\n\nStanding in my way\n\nStanding in my way hey\n\nstanding in my way\n\nThats what one dance can do\n\nOne dance can do"
