  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Life Room Anthem par JonathanÂ McReynolds\r\nWe'll have some fun tonight\n\n[Jonathan McReynolds]\nWe've been turning living rooms into life rooms\nWe've been giving God room with these life tunes\nWe just get too busy living than watching others live\nThat we forget the One who gave us life\nSo we've been turning living rooms into life rooms\n\nWe've been turning living rooms into life rooms\nWe've been giving God room with these life tunes\nWe just get too busy living than watching others live\nThat we forget the One who gave us life\n\nSo we've been turning living rooms into life rooms\n\n[Jonathan McReynolds]\nSee, we've been turning living rooms into life rooms\nWe've been turning living rooms into life rooms\nWe've been giving God room with these life tunes\nWe just get too busy living than watching others live\nThat we forget the One who gave us life\nSo we've been turning living rooms into life rooms\n\n[Dee-1]\nMy self worth ain't determined by my net worth\n'Cause God gave me a purpose on this earth\nAnd if I don't sell a lot of records, I ain't stressin'\n\nI'd much rather go platinum in Heaven\nSee life is full of distractions\nAnd we've become addicted to their temporary satisfaction\nBut yo, this ain't the end\nThere's another life after\nSo I work like a slave but I serve the right Master\nFaster, time's ticking everyday\nI'm trying to right my wrongs and do what the pastor say\nMan, I was reborn; Christ wiped my past away\nWhen you goin' finally make a change, when you pass away?\nYo, it all starts off by knowing one thing\nWe were only born to bring glory to our King\nI was like an all-star on the losing team\nGod signed me as a free agent and now I'm winning rings\n\n\n[Jonathan McReynolds]\nWe've been turning living rooms into life rooms\nWe've been giving God room with these life tunes\nWe just get too busy living than watching others live\nThat we forget the One who gave us life\nSo we've been turning living rooms into life rooms"
