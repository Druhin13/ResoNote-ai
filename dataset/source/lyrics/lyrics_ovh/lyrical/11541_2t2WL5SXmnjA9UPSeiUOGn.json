  "lyrics": "Same shit\r\nDifferent day\r\nI'm stuck here\r\nFeeling this way\r\nYou think you're clever\r\nLike I don't know you\n\nBut I know your bullshit\n\nAnd what you've been through\n\nShow me yours and I'll show you mine\n\nNot everybody's scars are on the outside\n\nGet a grip or get out\n\nI just don't care\n\n\n\nI'm slipping under\n\nDrowning in my 'what if' wonders\n\nA reflex, a setback\n\nA long list of things I still lack\n\nYou should leave me and do yourself the favor, baby\n\nCause we're not in love\n\nI'm convinced it's just the drugs\n\n\n\nIf I could find a way to get my feet on the carpet\n\nI'd make it through the door of this apartment\n\nIt would be easy just to relapse\n\nFall back into my old habits\n\nBut I've got too much dedication\n\nTo give it up on a pointless conversation\n\nGet a grip or get out\n\n'cause I just don't care\n\n\n\nI'm slipping under\n\nDrowning in my 'what if' wonders\n\nA reflex, a setback\n\nA long list of things I still lack\n\nYou should leave me and do yourself the favor, baby\n\n'cause we're not in love\n\nI'm convinced it's just the drugs"
