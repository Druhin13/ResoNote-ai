  "lyrics": "I left my dear trying to find adventure\r\nShe spent years trading my whiskey out for salsa\r\nStill I hear her voice in the pit of my failure\r\nI ride alone down Goodbye Road\r\nI kept my eyes tryna find better weather\n\nJust to find it ain't getting any better\n\nAnd still I hear her voice so clear and so tender\n\nIt's my tale to tell down Goodbye Road\n\n\n\nStrangers, outcasts, artists and thieves\n\nMisfits, legends and lost refugees\n\nWe may not be where we thought we would be\n\nWe made our home down Goodbye Road\n\n\n\nYou said you were my queen\n\nNow you're just an old disaster\n\nI said sticks and stones shouldn't be thrown from the pool pit pastor\n\nAnd when I hear that voice I try to move a bit faster\n\nI'd rather walk alone down Goodbye Road\n\n\n\nStrangers, outcasts, artists and thieves\n\nMisfits, legends and lost refugees\n\nWe may not be where we thought we would be\n\nWe made our home down Goodbye Road\n\n\n\nTravel in poe on the road to Damascus\n\nWe go so slow he laid down in a casket\n\nSometimes flowers grow in the soil of ashes\n\nPick 'em as you go down Goodbye Road\n\n\n\nStrangers, outcasts, artists and thieves\n\nMisfits, legends and lost refugees\n\nWe may not be where we thought we would be\n\nGo raid our home down Goodbye Road\n\n\n\nSometimes flowers grow in the soil of ashes\n\nPick 'em as you go down Goodbye Road\n\nWe made our home down Goodbye Road"
