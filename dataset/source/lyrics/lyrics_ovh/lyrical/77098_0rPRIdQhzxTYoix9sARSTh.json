  "lyrics": "Â© Don Williams\r\nUniversal Polygram International Publishing Inc.\r\n\r\nThe weather vane out on the shed is looking to the west\r\nI reckon I'll head that way, it's good as any way I guess\n\nClosing this old gate kinda ends our episode\n\n'Cause there's no use running when you're on the wrong road\n\n\n\nGal, it wouldn't take much for someone to define\n\nAll the contradicting flashes that burn across our minds\n\nBut there's no way to communicate if you don't know the code\n\nAnd there's no use running when you're on the wrong road\n\n\n\nThere's times I get to thinking about the way it might have been\n\nAnd I wonder how we got to this state that were in\n\nBut every word we spoke only added to the load\n\nAnd there's no use running when you're on the wrong road\n\n\n\nGuess we knew some things you've got to fight to win\n\nBut you get to standing back when after leading with your chin\n\nWe both learned to young that you reap what's been sowed\n\nAnd there's no use running when you're on the wrong road\n\nNo there's no use running when you're on the wrong road"
