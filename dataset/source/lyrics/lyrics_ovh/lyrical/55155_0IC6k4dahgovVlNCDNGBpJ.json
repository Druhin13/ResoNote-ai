  "lyrics": "Hey there everybody\r\nPlease don't romp or roam\r\nWe're a little nervous\r\n'Cause we're so far from home\r\nSo this is what we do\r\nSit back and let us groove\n\nAnd let us work on you\n\nWe've all spent years preparing\n\nbefore this band was born\n\nWith heaven's help it blended\n\nAnd we do thank the lord.\n\nNow we put you through the changes\n\nAnd turned around the mood\n\nWe hope it's struck you different\n\nAnd hope you feel moved\n\nSo forget about your troubles\n\nAs we search for something new\n\nAnd we play for you"
