  "lyrics": "LA why is it so complicated to me, twilight\r\nWaiting on the planet to turn to me, dark side\r\nIf loving you's a felony now, then I'm a renegade, riding\r\nTrying to find tomorrow and ease in\r\n'Til you dive in\n\nWhy you rolling waves over me now, that's all I need, dreaming\n\nWaiting on a lady, come find me, be forgiven\n\nI'll be a regular guy for you, I never said I'd do that\n\nWhy you looking so beautiful to me now when you're so sad?\n\n\n\nI will always think about you\n\nThat's why I'm calling you back\n\nOn my way through\n\n\n\nI wanna stay with you for a long time, I wanna be your star, love\n\nI wanna see it lay in your eyes when I'm leaving with your love\n\n\n\nI will always think about you\n\nThat's why I'm calling you back\n\nI gotta run soon\n\n\n\nI will always think about you\n\nThat's why I'm calling you back\n\nOn my way through"
