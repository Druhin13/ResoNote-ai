  "lyrics": "In one million years\r\nI never thought i'll meet someone as perfect\r\nI never thought that\r\nSomeone can make my mind go round in circles\r\nI never thought there was\r\nA beach with jet black sand in Jersey\n\nLike my legs\n\nI can't walk around without you\n\nLike my heart\n\nThe reason bound to change without you\n\nThe way it beats\n\nTapping on my mind when i think about you girl\n\nHolding on i can't let go of you\n\nOh yeah\n\nSaid i heard\n\nThat it never really rains in Arizona\n\nThat's what i heard\n\nAnd it came from the mouth of the one\n\nThat I'm all in love with girl\n\nLike a words of a preacher to the ears of a deacon\n\nYeah I don't see the same when your sleeping\n\nI'm so in love in love\n\nYes I'm going to Arizona\n\nLike my legs\n\nI can't walk around without you\n\nLike my heart\n\nThe reasons bound to change without you\n\nThe way it beats\n\nTapping on my mind when i think about you girl\n\nHolding on can't let go of you\n\nNow if i had to choose\n\nBetween money and you girl\n\nGive me sunshine and rain\n\nPleasure and pain ohh i\n\nI'd rather be holding your body\n\nLike my legs\n\nI can't walk around without you\n\nbaby yeah\n\nLike my heart\n\nIt Breaths without you it change without you\n\nThe way it beats\n\nTapping on my mind wen i think about you girl\n\nHolding on i can't let go of you"
