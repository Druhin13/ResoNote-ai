  "lyrics": "Baby we were just a masterpiece\r\nUp there on the wall for all to see\r\nWe were body and soul, we were talked about\r\nOnce you've been framed you can't get out\r\nWho's brave enough to take it down?\n\nWho's fool enough to lose the crown?\n\nWe're just another thing they'll all forget about\n\nThey'll be standing around laughin'\n\nLike nothing ever happened\n\n\n\nBaby we were just a rodeo\n\nShining up our buckles for the show\n\nOur knuckles white, we held on tight\n\n'Cause the longest ride makes the crowd go wild\n\n\n\nWho's gonna open up the gate?\n\nNo hope of riding to the eight\n\nWe ain't the cowboys, honey, we're the clowns\n\nThey're all standing around laughin'\n\nLike nothing ever happened\n\n\n\nOooh\n\nOooh\n\n\n\nBaby we were just a country song\n\nI'm still doin' time, the king is gone\n\nI tried to stand by my man\n\nWe were making plans, we were making plans\n\n\n\nWho's brave enough to take us down?\n\nWho's fool enough to lose the crown?\n\nMaybe another thing they'll all forget about\n\nThey'll be standing around laughing\n\nLike nothing ever happened\n\n\n\nOooh\n\nOooh\n\n(Baby we were just a masterpiece)\n\nBaby we were just a masterpiece"
