  "lyrics": "You're uninvited, you're kicking at my door\r\nFeeling restless, keep coming back for more\r\nA heavy burden, pulls me to the floor\r\nTaking over, make no mistake I'm sure\r\nBody, don't give up on me\n\nWho are you to judge me, pulling at my arms and legs?\n\nBody, don't give up on me\n\nEveryone is powerless, unable to help anyway\n\n\n\nWhat you're going through, I can't imagine\n\nHow you barely blink, like nothing has happened to you\n\nI could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you to lay your head down on\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you\n\n\n\nTaking a toll, but I hold my head up high\n\nI stay unfazed, but there's water in my eyes\n\nNow\n\n\n\nBody, don't give up on me\n\nWho are you to judge me, pulling at my arms and legs?\n\nBody, don't give up on me\n\nEveryone is powerless, unable to help anyway\n\n\n\nWhat you're going through, I can't imagine\n\nHow you barely blink, like nothing has happened to you\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you to lay your head down on\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you to lay your head down on\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you to lay your head down on\n\nAnd I could plant a rose garden\n\nFor you"
