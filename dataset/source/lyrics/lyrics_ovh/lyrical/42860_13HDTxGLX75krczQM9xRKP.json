  "lyrics": "Once there was a man\r\nwho had a little too much time on his hands\r\nhe never stopped to think that he was getting older.\r\nWhen his night came to an end\r\nHe tried to grasp for his last friend and pretend\r\nThat he could wish himself health on a four-leaf clover\n\n\n\nHe said is this the return to Oz? \n\nThe grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws \n\nThere's a wind-up man walking round and round \n\nWhat once was Emerald City is now a crystal town\n\n\n\nIts three o' clock in the morning \n\nYou get a phone call from the queen with a hundred heads\n\nShe says that they're all dead\n\nShe tried the last one on\n\nIt couldn't speak, fell off\n\nAnd now she just wanders the halls\n\nThinking nothing, thinking nothing at all\n\n\n\nShe says is this the return to Oz?\n\nThe grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws \n\nThere's a wind-up man walking round and round \n\nWhat once was Emerald City is now a crystal town\n\n\n\nThe wheelies are cutting pavement \n\nand the Skeksis at the rave meant\n\nto hide deep inside\n\ntheir sunken faces\n\nand their wild, rolling eyes\n\nBut their callous words reveal\n\nThat they can no longer feel\n\nLove or sex appeal\n\nThe patchwork girl has come to cinch the deal\n\n\n\nTo return to Oz we've fled the world\n\nWith smiles and clenching jaws\n\nPlease help me friend from coming down\n\nI've lost my place and now it can't be found\n\nIs this the return to Oz?\n\nThe grass is dead, the gold is brown and the sky has claws \n\nThere's a wind-up man walking round and round \n\nWhat once was Emerald City is now a crystal town"
