  "lyrics": "You were all there was when I caught up so you drive away\r\nShe caught my love, I can smell you from a mile away\r\nI feel your touch when I wake, and when I go to sleep\r\nI lost your trust, is there really much that I can say?\r\nYelling at the world telling it to slow down\r\nI'm parked outside your house\n\nJust thinking ’bout the thousand times we made up on the mountainside\n\nDon't give up on me now\n\nTalk or walk when we rolling around\n\n\n\nYou know I'm new in town, girl\n\nDon’t know where I'm at, but I need you around\n\nYou move to the sound so twe hit up and down (Fuck)\n\nThey laugh I'm not no Clout God, unless I go to Hollywood and I go uptown\n\nYou're a diamond in the rough, people look what I found, ooh\n\nI love those moves, to kill it with the juice, mix it all with the music\n\nPlay with fire, up in the sky\n\nI'm up every night, we need compromise\n\nYou had other guys, but they weren't wise to leave you tonight (Tonight)\n\nWhen I lie in my bed, you be by my side, tonight\n\nWhen I'm fly in my head, I get butterflies\n\nShe said \"Real lies, real lies, all your little lies\"\n\nWell let me say how I feel inside\n\n\n\nYou were all there was when I caught up so you drive away\n\nShe caught my love, I can smell you from a mile away\n\nI feel your touch when I wake, and when I go to sleep\n\nI lost your trust, is there really much that I can say?\n\nYelling at the world telling it to slow down\n\nI'm parked outside your house\n\nJust thinking ’bout the thousand times we made up on the mountainside\n\nDon’t give up on me now\n\nTalk or walk when were rolling around"
