  "lyrics": "I ain't got nobody hangin' 'round my doorstep\r\nAin't got no loose change just a-hangin' 'round my jeans\r\nIf you see somebody, would you send em' over my way?\r\nI could use some help here with a can of pork and beans\r\nI once had a family but they up and left me\n\nWith nothing but an 8-track, another side of George Jones\n\nI was in high cotton, just a-bangin' on my six-string\n\nA-kickin' at the trash can, walkin' skin and bone\n\n\n\nI can see your back porch if I close my eyes now\n\nI can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line\n\nI'm thinking it's your business, but you don't got to answer\n\nI'm knocking on your screen door in the summertime\n\n\n\nEverybody's out there climbin' on the trees now\n\nSwingin' in the breeze now, hangin' on the vine\n\nI'm dreamin' 'bout a sailboat, I don't need a fur coat\n\nUnderneath the dashboard got some sweet potato wine\n\n\n\nI can see your back porch if I close my eyes now\n\nI can hear the train tracks through the laundry on the line\n\nI'm thinking it's your business, but you don't got to answer\n\nI'm knocking on your screen door in the summertime\n\nI'm knocking on your screen door in the summertime"
