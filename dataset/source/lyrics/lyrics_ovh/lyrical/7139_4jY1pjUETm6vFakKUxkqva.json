  "lyrics": "Told her she's beautiful, she only view the folds\r\nUnder the UV rays, turning a hue to gold\r\nWatching the beauty gurus painting her cuticles\r\nStarving just so she can fit into cuter clothes\r\nSkipping many meals, splitting skinny pills\r\nStir 'em into spirits\n\nKill it, then we feel\n\nI wanna touch your skin\n\nI wanna feel her breathe\n\nBut there ain't any of her left\n\n\n\nThere's a skeleton in my bed where my love used to be\n\nThere's a dolled up mess on her neck where her head used to be\n\nI don't know these eyes, I don't know this nose\n\nI can't sleep laying next to all these bones\n\nThere's a skeleton in my bed where my love used to be\n\n\n\nTryna fabricate fine, going down in the brain\n\nSnot dripping down her lips, nose runnin' from 'caine\n\nTaking snaps then smashing everyone in the frame\n\nIn the morning, laugh it off like it's the funniest thing\n\nI need someone to blame, but hey: maybe it's me\n\nI wasn't at the door saying, \"Please stay, we should leave\"\n\nApplauding change instead of saying she's amazing to me\n\nYet when we laid in bed, both my eyes stayed on my feet\n\n\n\nPromises of date nights: \"Nah, I'm busy\"\n\nSaid, \"One drink with my friends?\": \"Nah, I'm busy\"\n\nShe was sure of me this morning, now she's iffy\n\nI think she's forgetting who's she really ditching\n\n\n\nThere's a skeleton in my bed where my love used to be\n\nThere's a dolled up mess on her neck where her head used to be\n\nI don't know these eyes, I don't know this nose\n\nI can't sleep laying next to all these bones\n\nThere's a skeleton in my bed where my love used to be\n\n\n\nThere's a skeleton\n\nThere's a skeleton\n\nThere's a skeleton in my bed where my love used to be"
