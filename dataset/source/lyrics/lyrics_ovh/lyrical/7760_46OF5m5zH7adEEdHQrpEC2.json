  "lyrics": "This is for the ones with words unspoken\r\nThis is for the ones dealing with hearts broken\r\nI can't believe everything I see\r\nA world full of hate and of vanity\r\nWith so much beauty and love inside me\r\nWhen does our innocence turn into arrogance?\n\n\n\nI am strong, I am weak\n\nI am everything between\n\nI am proud to be me\n\nI am human\n\nI am weird, I'm a freak\n\nI am different, I'm unique\n\nI will love who I please\n\nI am human\n\nYou are just like me\n\nYou are just like me\n\n\n\nFaith is so much stronger than fear\n\nOpen your heart to the truth you might hear\n\nTaste your words before you spit them out\n\nSilence can be louder than a shout\n\nThere's so much beauty and love inside us\n\nWhen does our innocence turn into arrogance?\n\n\n\nI am strong, I am weak\n\nI am everything between\n\nI am proud to be me\n\nI am human\n\nI am weird, I'm a freak\n\nI am different, I'm unique\n\nI will love who I please\n\nI am human\n\nYou are just like me\n\nYou are just like me\n\n\n\nRejoice it's a miracle\n\nRejoice it's a miracle\n\nRejoice it's a miracle\n\nRejoice it's a miracle\n\n\n\nI am strong, I am weak\n\nI am everything between\n\nI am proud to be me\n\nI am human\n\nI am weird, I'm a freak\n\nI am different, I'm unique\n\nI will love who I please\n\nI am human\n\nYou are just like me\n\nYou are just like me\n\nYou are just like me"
