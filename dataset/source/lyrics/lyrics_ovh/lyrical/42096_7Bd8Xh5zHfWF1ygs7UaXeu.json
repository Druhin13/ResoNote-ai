  "lyrics": "Life gave you everything\r\nAnd you threw it all away\r\nThrough the heart of the darkness\r\nNever feels the same\r\nHuh, it never feels the same\n\nLiving like a fool, nothing gets nothing\n\nAnd I got nowhere to hide\n\nSearching for the truth has to mean something\n\nI'm just pushing against the tide\n\nNothing left to say\n\nNothing left to say\n\n\n\nMemories, they seem like dreams\n\nAnd time's a gift of tears\n\nJust a map to remember this\n\nA future never planned\n\nIt's what we cannot understand\n\n\n\nRunning like a fool, distant existence\n\nYou're living hand to hand\n\nIsolated man, hard to understand\n\nNowhere else to hide\n\n\n\nLong for the feeling\n\nStand alone and pray\n\nNothing left to say\n\n\n\nLiving like a fool, nothing gets nothing\n\nBut I got nowhere to hide\n\nSearching for the truth has to mean something\n\nI'm just pushing against the tide\n\n\n\nLong for the feeling\n\nLife unjustified\n\nNowhere else to hide\n\nAin't nowhere else, nowhere else\n\n\n\nStand alone and pray\n\nYou got nothing left to say"
