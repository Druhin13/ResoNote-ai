  "lyrics": "How do I begin letting this loss end\r\nOpen up to heal again\r\nEverything is new, got sick point of view\r\nAsk you what would you have me to do\r\nLet me know when the coffee gets warm\n\nLet me know when the staircase gets here\n\nTo climb through heaven's door\n\nTo climb\n\n\n\nOpen my heart, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nWhere did you go, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nFind you\n\n\n\nFlashlight, a hollow fold\n\nInk seeps through into my bones\n\nAnd I'll fly there alone\n\n'Cause I promise I would be brave\n\nHe was so brave\n\n\n\nLet me know when the coffee gets warm\n\nLet me know when the staircase gets here\n\nTo climb through heaven's door\n\nTo climb\n\n\n\nOpen my heart, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nWhere did you go, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nTo find you\n\n\n\nOpen my heart, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nWhere did you go, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nOpen my heart, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you\n\nWhere did you go, further dive\n\nI'm reaching out to find you"
