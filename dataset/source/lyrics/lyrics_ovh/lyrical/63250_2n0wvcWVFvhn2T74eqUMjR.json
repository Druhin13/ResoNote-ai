  "lyrics": "My path has crossed with an unrecognizable appearence\r\nAs she shifts from the shadows of the twilight\r\nOnce transformed you can't tell if she reached her final state\r\nThe circumstances draw blood into her starving eyes\r\nShe hits the iron key to my continuety\n\nMy shell breaks while she sings her melody\n\n\n\nHer black eyes\n\nSet embossed\n\n\n\nThe cold slowly embraces my deepest unconciousness\n\nPlease end the engaging call out of the womens chest\n\nHer hands drifitng upon my skin, choking my sense\n\nA twist in my dimension opens up this gate of evil\n\n\n\nDon't strike her with a second stroke\n\nFor then she will not die\n\n\n\nVoices calling my name\n\nLeading my astray\n\nBlindfolded souls all have been taken away\n\nHer screamings shrill\n\nBut seducing at a time\n\nThis place may have an exit\n\nTurns out hard to find\n\n\n\nIs there a bridge to my decay\n\nOr does my mind just want to play"
