  "lyrics": "The Mississippi Delta was shining \nLike a National guitar \nI am following the river \nDown the highway \nThrough the cradle of the civil war \nI'm going to Graceland \n\nGraceland \n\nIn Memphis Tennessee \n\nI'm going to Graceland \n\nPoorboys and Pilgrims with families \n\nAnd we are going to Graceland \n\nMy traveling companion is nine years old \n\nHe is the child of my first marriage \n\nBut I've reason to believe \n\nWe both will be received \n\nIn Graceland \n\n\n\nShe comes back to tell me she's gone \n\nAs if I didn't know that \n\nAs if I didn't know my own bed \n\nAs if I'd never noticed \n\nThe way she brushed her hair from her forehead \n\nAnd she said losing love \n\nIs like a window in your heart \n\nEverybody sees you're blown apart \n\nEverybody sees the wind blow \n\n\n\nI'm going to Graceland \n\nMemphis Tennessee \n\nI'm going to Graceland \n\nPoorboys and Pilgrims with families \n\nAnd we are going to Graceland \n\n\n\nAnd my traveling companions \n\nAre ghosts and empty sockets \n\nI'm looking at ghosts and empties \n\nBut I've reason to believe \n\nWe all will be received \n\nIn Graceland \n\n\n\nThere is a girl in New York City \n\nWho calls herself the human trampoline \n\nAnd sometimes when I'm falling, flying \n\nOr tumbling in turmoil I say \n\nOh, so this is what she means \n\nShe means we're bouncing into Graceland \n\nAnd I see losing love \n\nIs like a window in your heart \n\nEverybody sees you're blown apart \n\nEverybody sees the wind blow \n\n\n\nIn Graceland, in Graceland \n\nI'm going to Graceland \n\nFor reasons I cannot explain \n\nThere's some part of me wants to see \n\nGraceland \n\nAnd I may be obliged to defend \n\nEvery love, every ending \n\nOr maybe there's no obligations now \n\nMaybe I've a reason to believe \n\nWe all will be received \n\nIn Graceland"
