  "lyrics": "You don't have to say a word\r\nI can see it in your eyes\r\nI know what you wanna say\r\nIt's so hard to say goodbye\r\nI can hold back my tears\n\nAnd try to be strong\n\nWhile our love is fallin' apart\n\nI know what I'll say\n\nIf you walk away\n\nBut what do I do\n\nWhat do I do with my heart?\n\n\n\nI'm not gonna say a word\n\nI know I can't change your mind\n\nYou know where you need to go\n\nI know I'll be left behind\n\n\n\nI won't hold you back\n\nI won't stand in your way\n\nIf you need to make a new start\n\nBut I still wanna know\n\nWhen my arms let you go\n\nWhat do I do\n\nWhat do I do with my heart?\n\n\n\nOh, girl, don't you remember?\n\nIt was not so long ago\n\nWe were makin' plans for two\n\nJust me and you\n\nNow you tell me that you've found somebody\n\nSomeone who loves you better\n\nNo one could ever love you\n\nThe way I do\n\n\n\nTell me you're not leavin' now\n\nTell me you're not leavin'\n\nTell me that you're gonna stay\n\nPlease say you'll stay with me, baby\n\nTell me that you love me still\n\nSay you love me still\n\nFor this and this alone I pray\n\nFall down on my knees and pray\n\n\n\nI'll do anything\n\nYes, I would\n\nTo save what we have\n\nTo keep you by my side\n\nI'll love you 'til death do us part\n\nBut what do I do\n\nWhat do I do\n\nWhen I'm still missing you?\n\nWhat do I do\n\nWhat do I do with my heart?"
