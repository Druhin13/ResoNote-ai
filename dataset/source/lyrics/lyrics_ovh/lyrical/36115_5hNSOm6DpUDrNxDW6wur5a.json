I don't want none\n\nGot to stay up, can't fall for none\n\nWhat you call love, I don't want none\n\nGot to stay up, can't fall off\n\n\n\nI spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope\n\nWon't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh\n\n'Cause I wonder where it might go\n\nDon't have it all, all all all all\n\nFigured out what you're talking on the side for\n\nI been walkin' on a tightrope\n\n\n\nI know it don't seem like\n\nI found my peace, but I\n\nBeen walking more steady every second since I left\n\nSteady pickin' up the piece I find at every step\n\nAnd I'm only gonna get more\n\n'Cause I'm doing what I'm supposed to\n\nPlanets told me that I'm special\n\nAnd they told me that so are you\n\nBut you won't step up\n\nSo tell me how the stars gon' bless us\n\nI walk with my chest up\n\nShoulders back, tight gut\n\nHahaha, hahaha\n\nYou pull me this way, push me that way\n\nGirl I really hope you know I can't stay\n\n\n\nI spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope\n\nWon't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh\n\n'Cause I wonder where it might go\n\nDon't have it all, all all all all\n\nFigured out what you're talking on the side for\n\nI been walkin' on a tightrope\n\nI spend my whole life walkin' on a tightrope\n\nWon't drop the ball, oh oh oh oh\n\n'Cause I wonder where it might go\n\nDon't have it all, all all all all\n\nFigured out what you're talking on the side for\n\nI been walkin' on a tightrope"
