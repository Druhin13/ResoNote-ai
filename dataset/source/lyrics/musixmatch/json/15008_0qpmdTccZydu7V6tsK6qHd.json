  "lyrics": "I let too much in\r\nAnd the souls begin\r\nWe were so much alive I couldn't win\r\nI had life pursuing sin\r\nAnd life pursuing wind\r\nAnd we were forcing dreams\r\nI can hear, but I cannot see\r\nI'll never be free\r\nI'll try, but I'll never be free\r\nAlways plagued by what I can never be\r\n♪\r\nAlone, the dreams of hopes and wasted goals\r\nSources and forces of the wasted lie\r\nThey slip\r\nThe pursuit of time, just wasting more\r\nPious and bias like light shining down on me\r\nAnd I was lost for me\r\nAnd I was tied to me\r\nI'll never be free\r\nI try, but I'll never be free\r\n♪\r\nIt's instrumental on the face of dawn\r\nNothing to gain\r\nThe middle is gone\r\nI would wait for things to die\r\nSo hard, so hard we tried\r\nI tried so hard\r\nHaven't figured anything out\r\nLeft behind, so much pain\r\nSo much doubt\r\nLeave worlds behind\r\nI'll never be free\r\nAlways plagued by what I'll never be"
