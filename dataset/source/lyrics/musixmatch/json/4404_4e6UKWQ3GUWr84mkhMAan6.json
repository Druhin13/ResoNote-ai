  "lyrics": "Sha-la-la, hey!\r\nLet's...\r\nFind a dark and lonely corner\r\nGrass growing up through the floorboards\r\nAnd kiss me over the garden gate\r\nNow this...\r\nMust be the deep and dismal\r\nAnd you're as pretty as a brow-beat thistle\r\nIn the early morning rain, yeah!\r\nIf you had your wish, would you lay me down?\r\nWould you shew out the ghost that spooked this town?\r\nIf I had my way, I'd swallow the dark\r\nAnd get this party started again, yeah!\r\nSha-la-la, sha-la-la\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nLet's...\r\nBe the red wine stain on the carpet\r\nInnocence after we lost it\r\nThe ballad of everything\r\nOh, bowed...\r\nWas the chrome on a motorcycle\r\nThe gold of a broken idol\r\nBabe, on a riverbank\r\nIf you had your wish would you lay me down?\r\nWould you shew out the ghost that spooked this town?\r\nIf I had my way I'd swallow the dark\r\nAnd get this party started again, yeah!\r\nSha-la-la, sha-la-la\r\nSha-la-la, sha-la-la\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nGonna get this party started\r\nRed wine stain on the carpet"
