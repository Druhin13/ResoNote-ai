  "lyrics": "Free everybody\r\nTrying to put my mental together like instrumentals\r\nCan't lose composure composing events coincidental\r\nCrystal ball on my pinky reflecting words in pencil\r\nHit the mall if you see me then I'm a hidden temple\r\nMy aura radiating blue bitch I would hate it too\r\nA pharaoh feel like Farrakhan my mind Jamaican views\r\nI got a vice for Nerfititties on a goddess fueled\r\nBy chocolate fountain melanated to the molecule\r\nI find it interesting crown is what a baby does\r\nI only claim it cuz my mental state is aiming up\r\nAnd bursting out of the fabric of my reality\r\nMy only goal is holy soul, you wanna battle me?\r\nHeaven is the golden state\r\nThere's no debate that my nirvana's under frozen gates\r\nThat's where my heart is found\r\nEither there or on the ground\r\nThey stomped it out as it was the fires of the underground\r\nCome around bound to the matrix and I'm going to frown\r\nDrumming loud sounds so I'm safest when Im on the mound\r\nNot sure if I'm traveling or caught up in the run around\r\nEnlightenment can't dumb it down and lightening isn't coming down\r\nDo you know what this is?\r\nI be having visions\r\nAnd all my angels ever say is money over wishes\r\nEveryone dismisses what they cannot comprehend\r\nSo I'm better off alone avoiding family and friends\r\nPlus my life's a battle\r\nI need sanity to win\r\nLooking in the mirror like I plan to free my twin\r\nNot the type you call a flame\r\nOnly rocking broken chains\r\nSolely flock to open brains\r\nA martyr tryna cope with pain\r\nTime will tell who is on my side\r\n(Time will tell just who is on my side)\r\nI mean well but I can't stop my pride\r\n(I mean well but I can't stop my pride)\r\nGive me drink, give me smoke\r\nGet me high, let me float\r\nI'm a cloud, coming down\r\nPut me down, gentle now\r\nGive me drink, give me dope\r\nBottom line, I can't cope\r\nIf I die, I don't know\r\nI don't know, I don't know\r\nGive me drink, give me smoke\r\nGet me high, let me float\r\nI'm a cloud, coming down\r\nPut me down, gentle now\r\nGive me drink, give me dope\r\nBottom line, I can't cope\r\nIf I die, I don't know\r\nI don't know, I don't know"
