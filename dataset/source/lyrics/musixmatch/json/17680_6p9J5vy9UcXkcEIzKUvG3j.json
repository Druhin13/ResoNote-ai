  "lyrics": "You're getting tired of the chump change\r\nYour head is spinning like a box fan\r\nYou think the water's rising slow but you can't stand...\r\nStanding in place, nobody wants it\r\nNobody wants it anymore\r\nSlow down your trajectory\r\nTry and understand we can't leave with these things in our hands\r\nI see you falling\r\ni see you falling for the currency\r\nI see you falling and it's so steep\r\nDid you hear about the tortoise and the greedy, greedy rabbit?\r\nDid nobody tell you just to pace yourself?\r\nStanding in place, nobody wants it\r\nNobody wants it anymore\r\nSlow down your trajectory\r\nTry and understand we can't leave with these things in our hands\r\nI see you falling\r\ni see you falling for the currency\r\nI see you falling and it's so steep\r\nStanding in place, nobody wants it\r\nNobody wants it anymore"
