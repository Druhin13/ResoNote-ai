  "lyrics": "You came with your troubled eyes\r\nOh and push and pull of loves desires\r\nYou came with your easy smile\r\nOh and your pretty words like coloured birds fly away\r\nI don't want to burn for you\r\nI don't want to yearn for you\r\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\r\nBut I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet\r\nWhen you leave you leave no clues\r\nSo I reinvent the things you meant\r\nAll of this undeclared charade\r\nKeeps me so unsure always wanting more everyday\r\nI don't want to burn for you\r\nI don't want to yearn for you\r\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\r\n(You know that I would lose myself)\r\nBut I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet\r\nYou stay the same with things you say\r\nIn long embrace, you walk away\r\nAnd now my eyes are full of lies\r\nAs I pretend that it's okay\r\nI don't want to burn for you\r\nI don't want to yearn for you\r\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\r\n(You know that I would lose myself)\r\nBut I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet\r\nI don't want to burn for you\r\n(I don't want to burn for you)\r\nI don't want to yearn for you\r\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\r\n(Know that I would lose myself)\r\nBut I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet\r\nI would love to get crazy in your body heat\r\n(You know that I would lose myself)\r\nBut I don't want to get trampled by your cold feet\r\n(You know that I would lose myself)"
