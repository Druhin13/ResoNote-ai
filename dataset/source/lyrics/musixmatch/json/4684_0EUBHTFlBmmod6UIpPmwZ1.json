  "lyrics": "I'm the life of the party\r\nI read between the lines and overthink\r\nWhat's the difference when I drink?\r\nSo open up another\r\nI'm a prisoner to this mood\r\nThere's an explanation and it's good\r\nI can change my attitude\r\nSo open up another\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me cause I need something from you\r\nYou're making me cool\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me 'til I see nothing but you\r\nYou're making me cool\r\nIt's hard to be myself\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nHard to be, hard to be\r\nIt's hard to be myself\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nSo just tonight\r\nWhat the fuck, yeah\r\nâ™ª\r\nDo you cure the nervousness?\r\nCause every word you say, I'm thinking less\r\nIt's a trick to second guess me\r\nLike you would a lover\r\nI'm a constant state of war\r\nWhy am I afraid of being sure\r\nSo fill me up, I'm insecure\r\nSo open up another\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me cause I need something from you\r\nYou're making me cool\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me 'til I see nothing but you\r\nYou're making me cool, yeah\r\nIt's hard to be myself\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nHard to be, hard to be\r\nIt's hard to be myself\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nSo just tonight\r\nWhat the fuck\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me cause I need something from you\r\nYou're making me cool\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me\r\nParty with me 'til I see nothing but you\r\nYou're making me cool, yeah\r\nIt's hard to be myself\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nIt's hard to be myself\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nSo just tonight\r\nWhat the fuck, yeah\r\nI could be, I could be\r\nI could be, I could be\r\nI could be cooler\r\nIt's hard to be, hard to be\r\nHard to be, hard to be\r\nIt's hard to be myself, yeah"
