  "lyrics": "I flirt with Brancusi's gesture\r\nI'm a bird in space\r\nAs his ghost escorts me to a magic place\r\nI'm dressed all in colours, neither white nor black\r\nAsk the begged question, need I come back\r\nI'll look nice like a bird in paradise\r\nForever caught in mid-flight\r\nHow I long to be\r\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\r\nForever caught in mid-flight\r\nHow I long to be\r\nHow I long to be\r\nSing on Olympus Mons so all the world can see\r\nPerfection in my structure, I have all I need\r\nThere's not a single stain on my song tonight\r\nWhen time is endless and I'm always right\r\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\r\nForever caught in mid-flight\r\nHow I long to be\r\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\r\nForever caught in mid-flight\r\nHow I long to be\r\nHow I long to be\r\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\r\nForever caught in mid-flight\r\nHow I long to be\r\nAnd I'll look nice like a bird in paradise\r\nForever caught in mid-flight\r\nHow I long to be\r\nHow I long to be\r\nHow I long to be"
