Yeah!\r\nI'm a man\r\nAt least I'm tryin' to be\r\nI've lived before\r\nThe other half of me\r\nI've lived before\r\nThat you don't want me\r\nBut in this search\r\nFor nothing desperately\r\nOh, I'm tryin' tryin'\r\nNot to be a fool\r\nI'm tryin' tryin'\r\nLord to keep my cool, baby tryin' so hard to keep it together\r\nAfter I find, baby\r\nThat true love of mine\r\nI'm just rollin' screamin'\r\nCryin' flyin'\r\nCan't be trusted, but busted\r\nRolling Stone\r\nYou're a woman\r\nAt least you say you are\r\nYou're a woman\r\nAt least you look like you are\r\nYou're a woman\r\nAt least you taste like you are\r\nBut you can take it off\r\nIn bed with my guitar\r\nAnd then you leave them\r\nThrow me outside\r\nTo cry, cry\r\nTo the moon and the nighttime\r\nSave my soul,\r\nYou can't find\r\nAll you want is a ticket to ride\r\nAfter you show me everything\r\nIt did prove otherwise\r\nYou just rollin', screamin', cryin' good love is sometime, but can't be trusted\r\nSteppin' Stone\r\nSteppin' Stone\r\nSteppin' Stone"
