  "lyrics": "Summertime, I'm still thinking 'bout you\r\nIf I don't love then what will I do?\r\nReality's here but not comin' through\r\n♪\r\nIn my mind, I can be what we choose\r\nBut in life, we can't stand in those shoes\r\nIt's something I knew\r\nBefore our debut\r\nWe can't be together\r\nI don't think I care\r\nAs long as I can think about you\r\nIn my head, forever\r\nI will not forget\r\nSaid I'll always think about you\r\nWe can't be together\r\nI don't think I care\r\nAs long as I can think about you\r\nIn my head, forever\r\nI cannot forget\r\nSaid I'll always think about you\r\nMaybe I'm not as real as I think\r\nIn daytime, my mind and heart ain't in sync\r\nBut at night, I only sleep through my blanks\n\nStruggling, to know what is going on\r\nOverthinking, I hope that it's my song\r\nCause if it is, I could play out the wrongs\r\nWe can't be together\r\nI don't think I care\r\nAs long as I can think about you\r\nIn my head, forever\r\nI will not forget\r\nSaid I'll always think about you\r\nWe can't be together\r\nI don't think I care\r\nAs long as I can think about you\r\nIn my head, forever\r\nI will not forget\r\nSaid I'll always think about you"
