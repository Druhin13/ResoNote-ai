I doubt it\r\nRolls-Royce, bitch just know I just bought it\r\nI just wanna be the man for my fam\r\nI been through pain, I walk in the the rain\r\nI look at my reflection up in the mirror\r\nAnd I can admit that I feel so ashamed\r\nI've done some dirt that I cannot forget\r\nI'm wipin' the blood, I'm wipin' my sweat\r\nThe reason I killed him 'cause he posed a threat\r\nI got some sons and I got a daughter\r\nYou playin' with me, there's gonna be a slaughter\r\nI don't wanna live my life like this no more\r\nI don't wanna sell this dope\r\nThe streets got me so fuckin' paranoid\r\nI don't know what I'ma do\r\nI'ma be a gangster forever\r\nAin't no love in the streets\r\nAnd I don't trust you\r\nI'm facing my demons\r\nThat evil, I've seen it\r\nThe money, the root of all evil, believe me\r\nYou rob, you steal, you pop a pill and you kill\r\nEvery time I need paper, this is the way that I feel\r\nMy brother told me do it for my nephew\r\nBullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue\r\nOne thing I know for certain\r\nEvery time you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you\r\nMy brother told me do it for my nephew\r\nBullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue\r\nOne thing I know for certain\r\nEvery time you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you\r\nI'm trying to change my life for the better\r\nIf I go to prison, would they write a letter?\r\nWould they even care, if I wasn't there?\r\nIt feels like I got haters everywhere\r\nHaters, suckers, motherfuckers\r\nI was built like no other\r\nIt's a cruel world, they criticize your skin color\r\nMobbin', robbin', homicide for something that makes them feel alive\r\nBut I'm always curious to find out where I'ma go when I die\r\nPeople hate me all the time, but they ain't even met me yet\r\nI was born to win in last, so that ain't nothin' I'ma sweat\r\nI came up off of sellin' that dope\r\nHave you ever had the cops break down your door?\r\nHave you ever had the cops put you on the floor and rob all of your dope?\r\nNo, you don't know, how that feels\r\nYou're totally broken and ready to kill\r\nYou're praying to God\r\nAsking for a deal, \"O Lord, I can't afford a meal\"\r\nI just want to go legit, I just feel like a piece of shit\r\nI don't wanna live my life like this no more\r\nI don't wanna sell this dope\r\nThe streets got me so fuckin' paranoid\r\nI don't know what I'ma do\r\nI'ma be a gangster forever\r\nAin't no love in the streets\r\nAnd I don't trust you\r\nI'm facing my demons\r\nThat evil, I've seen it\r\nThe money, the root of all evil, believe me\r\nYou rob, you steal, you pop a pill and you kill\r\nEvery time I need paper, this is the way that I feel\r\nMy brother told me do it for my nephew\r\nBullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue\r\nOne thing I know for certain\r\nEvery time you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you\r\nMy brother told me do it for my nephew\r\nBullets hit your body, now you leaving the rescue\r\nOne thing I know for certain\r\nEvery time you try to change, the devil's gonna come and test you"
