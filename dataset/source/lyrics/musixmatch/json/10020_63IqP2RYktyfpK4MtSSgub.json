  "lyrics": "Morning at last, so I open my eyes\r\nLike any other day\r\nA tie around my neck, and that's the last step\r\nTime passes by and I'm at my homeroom class\r\nHolding my head up high\r\nI take in a deep breath, and with it, I'm all set\r\nIt's just your typical day\r\nThat's carried in on the wind\r\nI think I hear it calling me\r\nI think I feel it waiting to be heard\r\nBut, can I answer? I feel my heart is trembling\r\nBut then I feel it once again\r\nAnd like a million stars it fills the sky\r\nIt flickers in my mind\r\nSo I wish them well\r\nAnd wave them farewell\r\n'Til we meet again\r\nTaking a break while in the middle of chores\r\nSweeping the corridors\r\nAlone in the hallway, why does this feel strange?\r\nI'm unaware that time will never resume\r\nFor the clock with my name\r\nBut somehow every day, I feel there's been a change\r\nThe dust I sweep turns to snow\r\nIt's slowly melting away\r\nI think I hear it calling me\r\nI think I feel it waiting to be heard\r\nBut, can I answer? I feel my chance is fleeting\r\nI feel as if I've finally found\r\nAll of the missing days so dear to me\r\nAnd all the memories\r\nSo can we pretend\r\nThat it's not the end\r\nMy story goes on\r\nI don't remember why\r\nIt caught me by surprise\r\nYou took me by the hand, pulling me along\r\nYesterday's far away, but we still have today\r\nDid you feel my heart just skip a beat?\r\nAs we greet this brand-new day\r\nI think I hear it calling me\r\nI think I feel it waiting to be heard\r\nBut, can I answer? I feel my heart is shaking\r\nBut then I feel it once again\r\nAnd like a thousand mornings yet to rise\r\nThey tumble before my eyes\r\nI think I hear it calling me\r\nI think I feel it waiting to be heard\r\nBut, can I answer? I feel my soul is trembling\r\nI finally found my missing piece\r\nLost in these days that mean the world to me\r\nThe finish line I dream\r\nSo I wish them well\r\nAnd wave them farewell\r\n'Til we meet again"
