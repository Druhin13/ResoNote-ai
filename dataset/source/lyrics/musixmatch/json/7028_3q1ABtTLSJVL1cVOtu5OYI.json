  "lyrics": "You could be the kind of party boy who goes out on a Tuesday night\r\nYou could spend your Friday evening staying in\r\nYou could watch from your window as the world goes racing by\r\nWe'll rule this town be the king of everything\r\nYou could act a fool or walk the line, chase your dreams or let 'em die\r\nYou be you, I'd only change one thing\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nI'm not tryna tell you who or how or what you gotta be\r\nBut you oughta be with me, yeah\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nYou could be a runaway with freedom on your mind\r\nI could break those chains that hold you down\r\nWe could be the steady kind that stands the test of time\r\nAnd I could be the one that make you see\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nI'm not tryna tell you who or how or what you gotta be\r\nBut you oughta be with me, yeah\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nâ™ª\r\nBonnie and Clyde, Jack and Diane\r\nLois Lane and Superman\r\nJude and Johnny, Dolly and Ken\r\nJFK and Marilyn\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nNo, I'm not tryna tell you who or how or what you gotta be\r\nNot who or how or what you gotta be\r\n'Cause you oughta be with me, yeah\r\nYou oughta be with me\r\nHolding me\r\nYou oughta be with me"
