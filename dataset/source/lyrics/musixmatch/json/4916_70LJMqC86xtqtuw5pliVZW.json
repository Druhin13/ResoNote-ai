  "lyrics": "They never tell you before they try and sell you\r\nWanna see how well you can swim\r\nI never told you before I went and sold you\r\nI was only gold on the rim\r\nIt's a one, two, three, pull it off and see\r\nThat a stitch at a time saves nine\r\nAnd you won't unravel when you're\r\nthrown from the saddle and you won't unwind\r\nI never meant to break your heart\r\nI never meant to break your heart\r\nI never meant to pull you apart but I do it all over again\r\nI never meant to break your heart, but I do it again\r\nI do it again\r\nI know I meant it, although I never said it\r\nI was only buying the time\r\nJust take a second to wind your watch and set it\r\nWe were only running behind\r\nIt's a one, two, three, count it out with me\r\nWhen you're in it a minute, you're mine\r\nI'm a quick controller so you won't fast forward and you won't rewind\r\nI never meant to break your heart\r\nI never meant to break your heart\r\nI never meant to pull you apart but I do it all over again\r\nI never meant to break your heart, but I do it again\r\nI do it again\r\nI do it again\r\nBut I do it again\r\nâ™ª\r\nI never meant to break your heart\r\nI never meant to break your heart\r\nI never meant to pull you apart but I do it all over again\r\nI never meant to break your heart, but I do it again"
