  "lyrics": "We were staying home to get away\r\nTrying to loose the hold but it's still too late\r\nDon't sigh on me, don't size me up at all\r\nWe were backing off with a bellyache\r\nYou can sit in a hole, you can save your belief\r\nI'm in awe, I'm forgetting everything\r\nWell don't corner me, you've got nerve to be\r\nGot dirt on you for feeling such a foolish thing\r\nSee it's good to be out and alone in the world\r\n'Cause nobody cares, and they never did anyways\r\nYou can pack that notion everyday\r\nYou can black my face, you can bury me\r\nI'm wide on all\r\nI'm wide on every side\r\nWe were spending in, we were on a date\r\nYou were giving me hell, or so you think\r\nI'm barreling in, I'm barely here at all\r\nYou think it's a funny thing\r\nYou think it's sex all day\r\nGod damn you\r\nGod damn you\r\nIt's got hold of me, or at least a key\r\nIt don't bother me, it don't bother me\r\nSee it's good to be out and alone in the world\r\n'Cause nobody cares, and they never did anyways"
