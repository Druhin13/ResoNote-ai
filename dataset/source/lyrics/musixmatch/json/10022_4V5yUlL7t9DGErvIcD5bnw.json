  "lyrics": "I've got my eyes on the prize keep them closed\r\nWill I regret the time that\r\nI'm spending comatose\r\nHeaven knows where the day goes\r\nHad to put, in the time, by the book\r\nGotta play the game, it's all the same\r\nI'm on the hook, take a look, in the mirror\r\nRunning out of time\r\nBut I think I'm lazy, these days\r\nThese days, I go my pace\r\nMarching through my mind\r\nHundred trumpet salute, hey\r\nI slept away another day\r\nDays go so slow, oh no\r\nI can't help but be bored\r\nI can't help but be bored\r\nTime ain't worth a dime if\r\nI knew where they sold it\r\nIn my hand, I can't hold it\r\nI can cope if empty hope is realized\r\nI keep contemplating\r\nWhere's my compensation\r\nHey let's take a recess\r\nAnd I know it's all a joke\r\nDon't get involved\r\nRunning out of time\r\nBut I think I'm lazy, these days\r\nThese days, I go my pace\r\nMarching through my mind\r\nHundred trumpet salute, hey\r\nI slept away another day\r\nDays go so slow, oh no, I can't help but be bored\r\nI can't help but be bored"
