  "lyrics": "Night was cold as Dawson\r\nAnd on a short white day\r\nThe grey sun rose, lightening hot\r\nAnd singing climbed its way\r\nThe lake wind mist was shrouded\r\nThe grandfather east wind blew\r\nMist rose on the tree limp\r\nI arose ahead of you\r\nAnd I made the morning coffee\r\nThen you feed on the stair\r\nYou said good morning to me\r\nThen I sat beside you there\r\nâ™ª\r\nAnd I made the morning coffee\r\nThen you feed on the stair\r\nYou said good morning to me\r\nThen I sat beside you there\r\nMy head in happy bloused\r\nFor love lives in this house"
