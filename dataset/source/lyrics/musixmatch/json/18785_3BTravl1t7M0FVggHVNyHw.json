  "lyrics": "The president has a sex tape\r\nThe government sold you drugs\r\nI'm just trying to get paid\r\nBut nobody's coughing up\r\nThe president has a sex tape\r\nThe medicine made you cry\r\nHush don't worry cause I'm bringing a mask\r\nYeah everybody's got a disguise\r\n♪\r\nThe president has a sex tape\r\nThe oceans all dried up\r\nThe devil got the dealer\r\nThe dealer got the dollar\r\nDon't tell me I can live off love\r\nThe president has a sex tape\r\nYour daughters aren't safe at night\r\nI got a feeling that my body is owned\r\nA feeling that my body ain't mine\r\n♪\r\nLook at who's having the fun\r\nEasy to smile when you're pointing the gun\r\n♪\r\nThe president has a sex tape\r\nThe immigrant died at sea\r\nFirst they come for you\r\nAnd then they come for me"
