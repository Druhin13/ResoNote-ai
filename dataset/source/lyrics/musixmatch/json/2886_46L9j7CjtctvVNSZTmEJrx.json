  "lyrics": "And I got the world in the palm of my hands\r\nAnd I, all I wanna do is make you dance\r\nIf I never see your face again, will I remember?\r\nEvery time we go out, free drinks, sitting in the VIP\r\n20 minutes in, wanna leave quick\r\nDo you wanna roll with me?\r\nIf I never see your face again, know I will remember\r\nLet's runaway\r\nWe could leave this crowd\r\nRunaway at the speed of sound\r\nIf you need to breathe, I'll be your remedy\r\nSo runaway, runaway\r\nRunaway with me\r\n♪\r\nOh, we, we could drive to the midnight sun\r\nWe're free, we're living like we just begun\r\nIf I never see your face again, know I will remember\r\nLet's runaway\r\nWe could leave this crowd\r\nRunaway at the speed of sound\r\nIf you need to breathe, I'll be your remedy\r\nSo runaway, runaway\r\nRunaway with me\r\n♪\r\nPedal to the floor, got the windows down in a rental car\r\nHands on the wheel in your eyes light up like a thousand stars\r\nIf we never see the world again\r\nKnow we will remember\r\n♪\r\nLet's runaway\r\nWe could leave this crowd\r\nRunaway at the speed of sound\r\nIf you need to breathe, I'll be your remedy\r\nSo runaway, runaway (runaway, runaway, runaway...)"
