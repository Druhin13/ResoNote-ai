Shout to Michael Rooker\r\nYou with a mic is like a eunuch with a hooker\r\nPressure (pressure pressure) cooker\r\nMy confusion's organized, I'm the lord of light\r\nYandu with an arrow's like Eso with the cordless mic\r\nFlow holy, no gospel trap, writin' like\r\nMichael Crichton put the rap in Velocirap-tor, or\r\nI hit you like a trap-door, when it rains it pours\r\nNo mental strains but I, stick out like Kurt Angle's temple veins\r\nYou got an empty brain, enter in my lane\r\nIt takes balls like a gender change, people talkin' out they ass\r\nCheck for the double-cross like 2 Chainz at Sunday mass\r\nHit you with the belly to belly, the suplex\r\nOff the roof of the duplex, willin' to group text\r\nWith Steely Dan, Groot, fuckin' baby Groot, the ghost of Dave Brubeck\r\nAlex Trebek and Boba Fett, who's next?\r\nAll I'm tryna do is just make mine\r\nWhy a sideline rider tryna take mine?\r\nCause I shine like the sun, broad day time\r\nPuttin' facts to the claps and the bassline (you know!)\r\nAll I'm tryna do is just make mine\r\nWhy a sideline rider tryna take mine?\r\nCause I shine like the sun, broad day time\r\nPuttin' facts to the claps and the bassline (you know!)\r\nIs that a good guy or a bad guy?\r\nUhh, good guy\r\nWell it looks like a bad guy\r\nWell, he's a good guy"
