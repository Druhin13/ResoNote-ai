  "lyrics": "We teach them to pretend, not to break the line\r\nTo always look away and never ask why\r\n♪\r\nWe sit beside the cradle, we tell them to be brave\r\nBut when the warning sounds it echoes to the grave\r\n♪\r\nWe keep blindly moving along the same old path\r\nNo common sense would guide us back to life\r\nNow look at us: the pinnacle conception\r\nHow we assumed these walls would never fall\r\nSleep\r\nFarewell forever, child\r\nFarewell\r\nWe are the last to walk the Earth\r\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\r\nHow it burns to embrace\r\nThat below the lilac skies\r\nEternity is just a breath away\r\n♪\r\nIn lockstep to damnation, to our dying breath\r\nEvery reckless footprint leaves the smell of death\r\nOn the wilting meadows we let them out to play\r\nWe said, \"No need to worry.\"\r\nNow they never may\r\nSleep\r\nFarewell forever\r\nWe are the last to walk the Earth\r\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\r\nHow it burns to embrace\r\nThat below the lilac skies\r\nEternity is just a breath away\r\n♪\r\nSleep\r\nFarewell forever\r\nWe are the last to walk the Earth\r\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\r\nHow it burns to embrace\r\nThat below the lilac skies\r\nEternity is just a breath away\r\nWe are the last to walk the Earth\r\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\r\nHow it burns to embrace\r\nThat below the lilac skies\r\nEternity is just a breath away\r\nWe are the last to walk the Earth\r\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\r\nHow it burns to embrace\r\nThat below the lilac skies\r\nEternity is just a breath away\r\nWe are the last to walk the Earth\r\nAnd watch the passing ages slowly sail\r\nHow it burns to embrace\r\nThat below the lilac skies\r\nEternity is just a breath away"
