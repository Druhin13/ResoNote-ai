  "lyrics": "There's no greater love\r\nthat I have ever found,\r\nNo one else I know\r\nwould lay His own life down\r\nFor someone like me,\r\nin my vanity and pride.\r\nWith his selfless love,\r\nyou've restored my life.\r\nNo other name is stronger\r\nOh, the grave could not contain\r\nLove so divine it cannot be explained\r\nNo greater, no greater love\r\nThan the love that found me.\r\nThere's no greater love\r\nthat could ever calm my rage,\r\nOh, there's nothing else\r\nthat can wash away my shame,\r\nOh, the things I've done\r\nthe things I can't believe\r\nOh, but all I know,\r\nis that you've forgiven me, yeah\r\nNo other name is stronger\r\nOh, the grave could not contain\r\nLove so divine it cannot be explained\r\nNo greater, no greater love\r\nThan the love that found me.\r\nHow marvelous, how wonderful, and my song shall ever be\r\nHow marvelous, how wonderful is my Savior's love\r\nNo other name is stronger\r\nOh, the grave could not contain\r\nLove so divine it cannot be explained\r\nNo greater, no greater love\r\nThan the love that found me.\r\nNo greater, no greater love\r\nThan the love that found me.\r\nNo greater, no greater love\r\nThan the love that found me."
