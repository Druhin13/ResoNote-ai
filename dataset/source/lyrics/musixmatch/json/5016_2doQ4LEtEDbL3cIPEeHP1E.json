Let me out!)\r\n(William!)\r\n♪\r\n(William! Let me out, William!)\r\n♪\r\nAnd I sat there on the steps\r\nConsidering death\r\nThere were only seconds left of the night\r\nAnd I said hell is the sun\r\nBurning forever at the center of things\r\nA ball on fire at the center of things\r\nA ball on fire at the center of things\r\nA brain on fire at the center of things\r\nA brain on fire at the center of things\r\n♪\r\nI can't turn this thing off, it keeps following me\r\nUsed to be so human now it's just a machine\r\nI can't turn this thing off, it keeps following me\r\nWhen'd you say you were leaving? When'd you really leave?\r\nI can't turn this thing off, it keeps following me\r\nUsed to be so human now it's just a machine\r\nI can't turn this thing off, it keeps following me\r\nWhen'd you say you were leaving? When'd you really leave?\r\n♪\r\n(Welcome to the Nevada Museum of Art audio guide)\r\n(We hope your experience will be-)\r\nHello, my name is Hojin Stella Jung, I'm a senior at McQueen High School\r\nMy portfolio is a collection of paintings\r\nThat was created during last summer, and the first half of my senior year, and it's called \"The Lady\"\r\nAnd I didn't feel very well when I painted the first, and I didn't feel very well when I painted the last, and\r\nIt was intense, it was an intense process, and\r\nIt was how I was trying to, very hard, personify that intensity\r\nBut it's hard to talk about her now, because I think she wasn't me\r\nAt least that's how I feel and I'm trying to figure out what to do now\r\nBut she represents fervor in woman\r\nShe is powerful, yet fragile, she dares but also averts her gaze\r\nAnd I love her, at least I did, and-\r\nBut now I feel lost, and I'm unsure of what to think and feel most of the time\r\nBut I did believe in her, \"The Lady\", and maybe\r\nThere is a different form now that the intensity takes\r\n(Enter another item number, followed by the pound sign, or you can hang up and call back later)"
