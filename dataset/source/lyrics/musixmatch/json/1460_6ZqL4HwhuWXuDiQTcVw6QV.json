  "lyrics": "Let me be your fortress, I'll let you in\r\nHideaway your secrets, I'll carry them\r\nYou're the one I've wanted to defend\r\nIf you let me be the hero I've never been\r\n'Cause our hearts can't cover the tracks\r\nWe both see where we keep comin' back\r\nI don't care what you've said in the past\r\nOut of the forest behind my door's a fortress\r\n♪\r\nOut of the forest behind my door's a fortress\r\nLet me be the war already won\r\nYou can be the nation where I come from\r\nWe can be the kingdom yet to come\r\nIf you let me be, let me be the one\r\n'Cause our hearts can't cover the tracks\r\nWe both see where we keep comin' back\r\nI don't care what we've said in the past\r\nOut of the forest behind my door's a fortress\r\n♪\r\nOut of the forest behind my door's a fortress\r\nEvergreens, evergreens all up ahead of me\r\nBlazin' a trail with the enemy textin' me\r\nYou like the best of me, not all the rest of me\r\nReminds of 70, put 'em amphetamines\r\nForever don't know what it meant to me\r\nEverything anyone ever has said to me\r\nBut you call my reverie, like you were sent to me\r\nMust climb to the mezzanine, stay till we're 70\r\nUnder the stars at 70 years\r\nOut of the forest behind my door's a fortress\r\n♪\r\nFortress\r\n♪\r\nOut of the forest behind my door's a fortress"
