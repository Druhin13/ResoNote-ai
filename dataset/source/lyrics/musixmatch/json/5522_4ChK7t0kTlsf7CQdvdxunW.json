  "lyrics": "My brother can't see me\r\nEven when I look in his eye\r\nMy friend, she don't hear me\r\nWhen she thinks she's right\r\nBut she says loves me\r\nOh, when she loves french fries\r\nAren't we all so safe now inside each other's hearts\r\nI've been looking\r\nI've been looking for love\r\nOne drop, holy water\r\nRuns to the ocean side\r\nAccepted no question into the rising tide\r\nNo lines drawn between them\r\nJust one great symphony\r\nNo longer one rain drop, he is the endless sea\r\nI've been looking\r\nI've been looking for love, love\r\nLove, love\r\nIn love there are no arrivals\r\nIn love there are no goodbyes\r\nIn love there are no arrivals\r\nIn love there are no goodbyes\r\nIn love there are no arrivals\r\nIn love there are no goodbyes\r\nIs love locked inside me\r\nWaiting for me to set her free?\r\nIs love all around us\r\nIs it the air we breathe?\r\nI've been looking\r\nI've been looking\r\nI've been looking\r\nI've been looking for love, love\r\nLove, love\r\nLove, love"
