  "lyrics": "So they took His body down\r\nThe man who said He was the resurrection and the life\r\nWas lifeless on the ground now\r\nThe sky was red as blood along the blade of night\r\nAs the sabbath fell they shrouded Him in linen\r\nThey dressed Him like a wound\r\nThe rich man and the women\r\nThey laid Him in the tomb\r\nSix days shall you labor\r\nThe seventh is the Lord's\r\nIn six He made the earth and all the heavens\r\nBut He rested on the seventh\r\nGod rested\r\nHe said that it was finished\r\nIn the seventh day, He blessed it\r\nGod rested\r\n♪\r\nSo they laid their hopes away\r\nThey buried all their dreams above the kingdom He proclaimed\r\nAnd they sealed them in the grave\r\nAs a holy silence fell on all Jerusalem\r\nBut the Pharisees were restless\r\nPilate had no peace\r\nAnd Peter's heart was reckless\r\nMary couldn't sleep\r\nBut God rested\r\n♪\r\nSix days shall you labor\r\nThe seventh is the Lord's\r\nIn six He made the earth and all the heavens\r\nBut He rested on the seventh\r\nGod rested\r\nHe worked 'til it was finished\r\nIn the seventh day, He blessed it\r\nHe said that it was good\r\nAnd the seventh day, He blessed it\r\nGod rested\r\n♪\r\nThe sun went down\r\nThe sabbath faded\r\nThe holy day was done and all creation waited"
