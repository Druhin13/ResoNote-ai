  "lyrics": "I hear these rappers acting out because they got some plays\r\nThey got no passion for the music, but they on a stage\r\nI see the industry and it needs to be rearranged\r\nI've got no doubt inside my mind that I'mma be the change\r\nMissing a brain, always the same\r\nActing like life is a mo'fuckin' game\r\nAlready late, never retain\r\nGlorify money, depression, and pain\r\nDon't let the internet know where you stay\r\nOwe people that wanna show you to your grave\r\nI think that you should stop merging your lane\r\nAnd throw away all of your diamonds and chains\r\nBecause they got some plays\r\nThey got no passion for the music, but they on a stage\r\nI see the-, and it needs to be rearranged\r\nI've got no doubt inside my mind that I'mma be the change"
