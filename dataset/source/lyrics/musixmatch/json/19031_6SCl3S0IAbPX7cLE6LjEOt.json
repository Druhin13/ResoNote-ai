  "lyrics": "Ships in the making\r\nBound for a distant shore\r\nWorld for the taking\r\nMen gone forever more\r\nBoarding and setting sail\r\nYet victory won't prevail\r\nFreeze the arrow in the air\r\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\r\nBe the first to turn around\r\nTake the leap to land on higher ground\r\n(Leap to land on higher ground) higher, higher\r\nCall it surrender\r\nStill won't feel like defeat\r\nMen laying down their swords\r\nEach of their own accord\r\nFreeze the arrow in the air\r\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\r\nBe the first to turn around\r\nTake the leap to land on higher ground\r\nRaise the banner to the sky\r\nFace the fear and hold your head up high\r\nOh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh\r\nTake the leap like you are bound for higher ground\r\n(Let this take you higher) higher, higher\r\nFreeze the arrow in the air\r\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\r\nFreeze the arrow in the air\r\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\r\nBe the first to turn around\r\nTake the leap to land on higher ground yeah-oh\r\nBe the first to turn around\r\nTake the leap and land on higher ground"
