  "lyrics": "know that you're leaving\r\nWhile we're still undone\r\nIt's gone right before our faces\r\nGone without a trace\r\nWe had something special\r\nI don't need no space\r\nSo come back now\r\nWon't you give me some hope, come on\r\nI'll be dancing like nobody is watching\r\nAnd I wanna be all you need for a second\r\n'Cause I'm into you\r\nNow I'm trying to get your attention\r\nSo I'm calling you up on my best intentions\r\n'Cause I'm into you\r\nI'm into you\r\nI'm into you\r\nRemember the fire we had\r\nOur eyes they're shining so bright\r\nWhen our hearts collide\r\nI don't need a doctor, you're my medicine\r\nGiving me a high when walls are caving in\r\nSo come back now\r\nWon't you give me something, tonight\r\nI'll be dancing like nobody is watching\r\nAnd I wanna be all you need for a second\r\n'Cause I'm into you\r\nNow I'm trying to get your attention\r\nSo I'm calling you up on my best intentions\r\n'Cause I'm into you\r\nI'm into you\r\nI'm into you\r\nI'm into you\r\nI'm into you\r\nDancing like nobody is watching\r\nAnd I wanna be all you need for a second\r\n'Cause I'm into you, I'm into you"
