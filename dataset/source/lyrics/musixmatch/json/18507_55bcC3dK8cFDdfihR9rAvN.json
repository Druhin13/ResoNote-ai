  "lyrics": "My head is still spinning\r\nI don't know what happened\r\nBut I know I have to turn and walk away\r\nThe house is still burning\r\nThe walls are caving in\r\nAnd I will be a goner if I stay\r\nSo I blame it on my heart\r\nBut it's just misguided\r\nAnd why I always fall apart\r\n'Cause I get too excited, too excited\r\nWhat am I gonna do when I'm no longer unhappy over you?\r\nAnd who's gonna turn me out\r\nAnd be all I ever sit and think about?\r\nThe fog is just lifting\r\nGlimpses of where I've been\r\nI'll pass the torch or be the force I seek\r\nAnd I know he's got a heart\r\nAnd it's just misguided\r\nBut he's why I fall apart\r\n'Cause I get too excited (too excited)\r\nWhat am I gonna do when I'm no longer unhappy over you?\r\nAnd who's gonna turn me out\r\nAnd be all I ever sit and think about?\r\nCreate and destroy\r\nTake my heart, boy\r\nHey now, destroy\r\nCome on, take my\r\nOh and destroy\r\nWhat am I gonna do when I'm no longer unhappy over you?\r\nAnd who's gonna turn me out\r\nAnd be all I ever sit and think about?\r\nNeed your hurt, boy\r\nCome on, destroy\r\nTake my heart, boy\r\nCreate and destroy\r\nAh, ah, oh\r\nAh, oh\r\nCreate and destroy\r\nTake my heart, boy\r\nHey now, destroy\r\nCome on, take my\r\nOh and destroy"
