  "lyrics": "I think I gotta leave town\r\nDrive on through the night\r\nCalled you from a stranger's phone\r\nJust trying to make it right\r\nI wish I was somewhere else\r\nWish I knew what to say\r\nI could give you so much, girl\r\nBut you gave it away\r\nYou and me were like the stars\r\nWe were lighting up the dark\r\nOne minute you were in it, the next you were gone\r\nI don't really get it\r\nWhere did it go wrong?\r\nOh, we used to feel the same\r\nNow we're breaking like the waves in California\r\nEverything we had just feels like a dream\r\nNow you're just a photo on my Iphone screen\r\nAnd I don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nI don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nLying in a motel\r\nHalfway to the coast\r\nRunning from the city lights\r\nAs far as I could go\r\nI wish you were here with me\r\nI wish you would call\r\nNow I only see you in my feed\r\nNever on my wall\r\nYou and me were like the stars\r\nWe were lighting up the dark\r\nOne minute you were in it, the next you were gone\r\nI don't really get it\r\nWhere did it go wrong?\r\nOh, we used to feel the same\r\nNow we're breaking like the waves in California\r\nEverything we had just feels like a dream\r\nNow you're just a photo on my Iphone screen\r\nAnd I don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nI don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nI don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nI don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nYou and me were like the stars\r\nWe were lighting up the dark\r\nEverything we had just feels like a dream\r\nNow you're just a photo on my Iphone screen\r\nAnd I don't wanna hit delete\r\nI don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nI don't wanna hit delete (woah, woah)\r\nYou and me were like the stars (woah, woah)\r\nWe were lighting up the dark (woah, woah)\r\nI don't wanna hit delete"
