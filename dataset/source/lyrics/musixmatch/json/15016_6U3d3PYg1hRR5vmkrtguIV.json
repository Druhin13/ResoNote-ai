  "lyrics": "Wake up\r\nLost in the dark.\r\nBlind to the day.\r\nWe are the flock ignorance has maimed.\r\nI'll face these trials, I'll tread the path seldom thought of.\r\nI'll face this life of pain, maybe then we can find a better way.\r\nI'm sick of giving the power to everything but myself.\r\nEcho chamber; we are reborn to live the night again and again.\r\nCan you fucking end this pain, so we'd never be alone, afraid?\r\nI find myself dreaming about a time when I was fine.\r\nI close my eyes, but I can't bring back that design.\r\nWhat were you thinking, giving life to me?\r\nOh, what a wretched existence, half alive, half asleep.\r\nThe truth is I'm dying.\r\nMother don't you blame yourself, just know that I'm trying.\r\nThe truth is I'm dying on my own.\r\nThis is what we are, caged minds, stuck in this poisoned paradigm.\r\nShow me the fucking lie.\r\nI will say it again,\r\nthat what you think is what you've thought before.\r\nEcho chamber; we are reborn to live the night again and again.\r\nCan you fucking end this pain, so we'd never be alone, afraid?\r\nI'm not afraid\r\nYou didn't think this through, creating me, prolonging you.\r\nShow me you're thinking.\r\nFind me the path...\r\nThe one worth living.\r\nI don't know how else to say it,\r\nwe've been living in a dream world,\r\na fucking nightmare, and I think it's time we woke up.\r\nOr we can die, having lived a lie.\r\nWe're not done yet."
