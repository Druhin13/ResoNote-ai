  "lyrics": "I can see you when the clouds move slowly\r\nYour features in a sky wide open\r\nFor just the two of us\r\nI know there's something bigger to this\r\nDeeper than a thousand oceans\r\nUnderneath me as I take my moment\r\nHere just to say it all\r\nI'll break your fall\r\nWe'll make it \"through it all\"\r\nWe'll make it \"through it all\"\r\nAnd I won't let you fall"
