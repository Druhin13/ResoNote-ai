  "lyrics": "In the back of the matinée, sitting on velvet\r\nTilt your head back when the trailers play, red light exit\r\nOh, you're breathing in when you're ready\r\nOh, you're breathing dust slow and steady\r\nGoodbye, baby, it's alright\r\nLos Angeles overnight\r\nWalking backwards down the canyon drive, feeling my red eyes\r\nPast the plant life on the shoulder side growing in streetlight\r\nOh, I'm breathing in when I'm ready\r\nOh, I'm breathing dust slow and steady\r\nGoodbye, baby, it's alright\r\nLos Angeles overnight\r\n♪\r\nOoh, got lost in my mind\r\nOoh, I'm wasting my time\r\nI don't think I would like it\r\nGoodbye, baby, it's alright\r\nLos Angeles (leaving Los Angeles) overnight\r\nIt's gonna be okay, you're gonna be alright\r\nTime after time\r\nIf you wanna stay or if you wanna change\r\nI won't change your mind\r\nGoodbye, baby, it's alright\r\nLos Angeles overnight"
