  "lyrics": "She cried for nights\r\nShe ran for light\r\nShe looked for strength, but couldn't find\r\nThe enemy, in front of her\r\nShe stood right there and I said\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nAnd I said\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nAnd I said\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nAwaken now, you're perfect\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nYou're perfect, you're worth it\r\nShe smiled for days\r\nThen light turned dark\r\nShe lost control\r\nShe gained some strength\r\nHer love in light, stood right there and I said\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nAnd I said\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nAnd I said\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nAwaken now, you're perfect\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nYou're perfect, you worth it\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nAwaken now, you're perfect\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nYou're perfect, you're worth it\r\nWhen time went by, she realized\r\nThe love she found, did not last\r\nShe learned today, it's all inside\r\nWe cannot live another lie\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nAnd I said\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nDon't go breakin her heart\r\nAnd I said\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nAwaken now, you're perfect\r\nJust let it shine, your morning light\r\nYou're perfect, you're worth it"
