  "lyrics": "Put that professor into a cab\r\nAvoiding as best as one can\r\nThe voice of a doomed man\r\nCondemning his students and my lack of power\r\nI knew him, I can hear you\r\nThe whole bar can\r\nThe supervisor lied over the phone\r\nHe never got up to check next door\r\nOh, that nineteen year old kid\r\nWho came into work but was nonetheless re-convicted\r\nOver the counter Laura told me all about it\r\nI can hear you\r\nThe whole bar can\r\n♪\r\nI know what you'd like me to say\r\nBut you got to do exactly what you wanted\r\nIt's how you got your limp\r\nAll your strength came from her humiliation\r\nI can hear you\r\nI can't do anything\r\n♪\r\nQuitting the bar perfectly understood in the end\r\nHe will be leaving a garbage tip as his revenge"
