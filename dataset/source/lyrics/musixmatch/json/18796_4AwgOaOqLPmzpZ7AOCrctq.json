  "lyrics": "I'll have a drink tonight\r\nI'll get to feelin' alright\r\nMy eyes get chained to you\r\nI can't seem to make them do\r\nJust what I want to anymore\r\nIf I close 'em now I'll hit the floor\r\nAnd the next thing I know\r\nThe sunlight's breakin' day\r\n♪\r\nIf I get the chance to breathe\r\nI'll try to do it with ease\r\nFor if too hard I inhale\r\nI fear I lose the trail\r\nBeneath the freshly scattered brush\r\nThough it really don't matter all that much\r\nI guess I'll just have to find another way\r\n♪\r\nI'll lie awake in bed\r\nGoing over the things I said\r\nI'd say 'em all again\r\nIf I thought you'd spend\r\nJust one more night with me alone\r\nNow I can't even get you on the phone\r\nIt's all just a ruse like a trick some fool has played\r\n♪\r\nNow the room is spinnin' round\r\nCan't seem to slow it down\r\nIf I'm taken by the night\r\nTell my ma I did alright\r\nI just couldn't stop all the time\r\nI just kept standing there in line\r\nWaiting until tomorrow goes away\r\nJust trying to kill some time and make it pay\r\nI go up on a hill\r\nDown on my knees and pray\r\nLet someday it will\r\nWhen tomorrow goes away\r\nOh, oh"
