  "lyrics": "When I thought my world was over\r\nCouldn't get me out of bed\r\nBut the dreams they kept rolling\r\nThought I couldn't get ahead\r\nWell you know I tried praying\r\nTried to wish it all away\r\nEven tried meditating\r\nBut the feelings stay the same\r\nI'm not in control\r\nI'm not cut out for this\r\nSo I took it back to New York\r\nAnd cried to my mom, oh\r\nI thought I'd know me by now\r\nSo I went see a doctor\r\nHe said I look mighty fine\r\nBut when I went to see the joker\r\nHe knew something's on my mind\r\nThey say it's all about delivery\r\nSaid it's all about my stance\r\nWell the thing I like about you\r\nIs you love me, oh you love me\r\nOoo you love me, you love me\r\nLove me all the while\r\nYou love me, you love me\r\nYou love me, you love me"
