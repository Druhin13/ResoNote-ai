  "lyrics": "Independent, that's how you view yourself\r\nNow that you're twentytwo, twentytwo\r\nIf I could do it, I would stay young for you\r\nWe could live inside a place\r\nWhere we'd never have to face\r\nAll the people who disgrace us\r\nAnd make us hide our face\r\nBusted and used, that's how you view your girl\r\nNow that she's twentytwo, twentytwo\r\nIf I could do it, I would stay young for you\r\nWe could live inside a place\r\nWhere we'd never have to face\r\nAll the people who disgrace us\r\nAnd make us hide our face\r\nIf I could do it, I would fly into the sun\r\nI would become warm\r\nAnd I meant it when I said you're my favourite son\r\nWith your finger that is reaching\r\nFor the trigger of the gun\r\nAnd you know you've got to prove it\r\nTo yourself and everyone\r\nI do not go quietly\r\nInto the night that calls me\r\nEven when I'm alone\r\nI do not go quietly\r\nInto the night that calls me\r\nEven when I'm alone\r\nIf I could do it, I would take her in my arms\r\nI would unwrong all his wrongs\r\nI could stay here and write a thousand songs\r\nJust to show her that the stars\r\nStill come out behind the fog\r\nThere's a light on in the lighthouse\r\nYou can see it in the dark\r\nI do not go quietly\r\nInto the night that calls me\r\nEven when I'm alone\r\nI do not go quietly\r\nInto the night that calls me\r\nEven when I'm alone\r\nâ™ª\r\nI do not go quietly\r\nInto the night that calls me\r\nEven when I'm alone\r\nI do not go quietly\r\nInto the night that calls me\r\nEven when I'm alone"
