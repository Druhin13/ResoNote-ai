  "lyrics": "I think about you all the time\r\nHow we would feel if you were mine\r\nI know, I should've tried to move on Waited, we even go this wrong\r\nNow I'm stuck wondering if we would have made it\r\nAnd I'm still wondering, wondering\r\nIf you found somebody new\r\nHave you found somebody new?\r\nAre you telling me the truth?\r\nHave you found somebody new?\r\nHave you?\r\nWe used to be so in tune\r\nNobody could tell us what to do\r\nNow I, feeling so insecure\r\nWithout you, I don't feel so sure\r\nNow I wish that I knew if we would have made it\r\nAnd I wish that I knew\r\nIf you found somebody new\r\nHave you found somebody new?\r\nAre you telling me the truth?\r\nHave you found somebody new?\r\nHave you?\r\nHave you, have you\r\nFound somebody, somebody new\r\nBut I knew from present time,\r\nIt's over now\r\nDo we lose if we just give it one more chance?\r\nI find it hard to keep chasing\r\nBut my heart is broken\r\nBut I miss you so much that was always chosen\r\nHave you?\r\nMy door's always open\r\nHave you, have you"
