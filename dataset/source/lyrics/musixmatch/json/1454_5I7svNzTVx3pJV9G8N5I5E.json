  "lyrics": "I can feel your fingertips\r\nSomewhere in the distance\r\nFeeling cataloged and broken down to code\r\nBut the flow of my existence is mine to control\r\nAnd I'm following that wide open road\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nThe days turn to decade\r\nTurn the duck to stone\r\nNext thing you know\r\nYou're living like a frog\r\nHow can I be forgotten\r\nBe the only ones who know\r\nI live to learn\r\nAnd I learn to love, by God\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nLies of omission\r\nLies often told\r\nLies upon lies upon deception\r\nAnd I'm lightning in a bottle\r\nI'm crying inside\r\nI can't hide from the pain of reflection\r\nGet out the way\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\n(Get out the way)\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way\r\nComing out of the darkness\r\nComing out of the dark\r\nGet out the way"
