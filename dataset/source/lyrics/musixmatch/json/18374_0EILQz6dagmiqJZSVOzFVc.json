Are you ready? Are you ready? No\r\nI can see you through my window\r\nOutside my door\r\n(I can see you breathe)\r\nYou're only getting started\r\nWhat are you waiting for?\r\n(I can tell you want more)\r\n(It's all I wanna do)\r\nAll she wants to do is, wants to do is party\r\n♪\r\nAll she wants to do is, wants to do is party\r\nBring out the cupcakes, bring out the fun\r\nBring out the birthday boy, come on everyone\r\nYou think that you can hide, you think you can escape?\r\nCan't stop, won't stop, until there's no more cake\r\nThere's no more cake\r\n(There's no more cake)\r\nThere's no more cake\r\nFor goodness sake\r\nThere's no more cake\r\nThere's no more cake\r\nFor goodness sake.\r\nNo more, no more, NO MORE CAKE!"
