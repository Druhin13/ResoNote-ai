  "lyrics": "I must be honest\r\nUnder the surface\r\nIt grinds like a blender\r\nThe sound of two voices\r\nMy heart seems to fail me\r\nIt put me in a stranger's bed\r\nIt hurt who I love the most\r\nI'll never trust it again\r\nThat's why I don't want what I want\r\n'Cause what I want, it just might kill me\r\nAnd I won't think of my needs\r\n'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me\r\nEnvy is endless\r\nI used to put mistakes up on a board\r\nCompare how mine sticks\r\nNext to the rest of the worlds'\r\nThat got me nowhere but miles from changing\r\nNow I've got deep stains\r\nAnd bleach won't erase them\r\nThat's why I don't want what I want\r\n'Cause what I want, it just might kill me\r\nAnd I won't think of my needs\r\n'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me\r\nCall me on everything\r\n'Cause I can't see how it looks from your perspective\r\nCall me on everything\r\n'Cause I can't help myself and I need your protection from me\r\nI lose every time\r\nI lose every time\r\nI lose every time\r\nYou think you're inspiring\r\nPosting slogans on a photo of the sky\r\nYou're letting sleeping dogs lie\r\nIt's not so simple as\r\nDo what makes you happy\r\nIf that's the same thing\r\nThat will destroy me\r\nThat's why I don't want what I want\r\n'Cause what I want, it just might kill me\r\nAnd I won't think of my needs\r\n'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me\r\nI must be honest\r\n(For me)\r\nUnder the surface\r\nIt grinds like a blender\r\n(I know there's never enough for me)\r\nThe sound of two voices\r\nMy heart seems to fail me\r\n(For me)\r\nIt put me in a stranger's bed\r\nIt hurt who I love the most\r\n(What I need, I know there's never enough for me)\r\nI'll never trust it again"
