  "lyrics": "You can't erase a blank slate\r\nYou flip a coin and make your choice\r\nIt's been a while since you made your mark\r\nYou've gotten used to pissing in the dark\r\nBut you can't go back so you just\r\nLook for a door on the current day\r\nIn a river of endless hallways\r\nYour dull blade and your dusty attire\r\nCan bring back all those burning desires\r\nSo go back to the pit or roll over\r\n♪\r\nThere's no finish line for a divided heart\r\nFeel the horns in your side\r\nPick up another cigarette\r\nSmoke it now and soon you'll forget\r\nIf only your silver lining had better timing\r\n'Cause there's no crown for one on the way down\r\n♪\r\nJust look at its eyes\r\n♪\r\nLight another cigarette\r\nSmoke it now and soon you'll forget\r\nIf only your silver lining had better timing\r\n'Cause there's no crown for one on the way down"
