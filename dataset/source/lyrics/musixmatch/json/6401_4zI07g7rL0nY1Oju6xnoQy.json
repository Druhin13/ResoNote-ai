  "lyrics": "You're no true soul, you'll never be\r\nMan-made device, you've haunted me\r\nYou're built to serve, to calculate\r\nYou're built to love, to overtake\r\nStay with me\r\nFor I would never ever leave you\r\n♪\r\nHold my hand\r\nFor I would never ever let it see an end\r\nOh, you are mine\r\nOh, I could never ever leave you behind\r\nOh, stay with me\r\nFor I would never ever leave you\r\nLook at you now, you're a dying machine\r\nCold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased\r\nAgain, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place\r\nMechanical cradle, synthetic embrace\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\n♪\r\nThe years go by, you follow me\r\nManufactured eyes see everything\r\nYour corroding core degenerates\r\nProgrammed to love and terminate\r\nOh, I must stay\r\nFor I could never ever turn your love away\r\nOh, you're the one\r\nFor I could never ever see our love undone\r\nI'm not your fool\r\nAnd I could never ever say a thing so cruel\r\nSo stay with me\r\nCause I am never ever gonna leave you\r\nLook at you now, you're a dying machine\r\nCold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased\r\nAgain, you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place\r\nMechanical cradle, synthetic embrace\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\n♪\r\nAs deep as any ocean\r\nLike a promise of the morning sun\r\nNever ending, never done\r\nThe scale of my devotion\r\nI crave until we love again\r\nFollow to the bitter end\r\nLike walking in a nightmare\r\nA travesty, a shell born dead\r\nFabricated, interbred\r\nRelentless as you like it\r\nNever ending, never gone\r\nNever changing, never done\r\nNever changing, never done\r\n♪\r\nLook at you now, you're a dying machine\r\nCold and disfigured, corrupted, diseased\r\nAgain you've come back, oh, I'll die in this place\r\nMechanical cradle, synthetic embrace\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine\r\nYou're a dying machine"
