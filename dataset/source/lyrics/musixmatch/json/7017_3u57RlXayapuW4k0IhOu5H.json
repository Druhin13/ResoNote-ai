  "lyrics": "The blot in my eyes...\r\nCircular\r\nThe blot in my eyes...\r\nCirculate\r\nAll my pockets are full and my mind is lost\r\nCirculate\r\nThe rearview keeps shifting as I stare at the sun\r\nThe blot in my eyes...\r\nCircular\r\nThe blot in my eyes...\r\nCirculate\r\nAll together... back and forth as the wind cusps my inner mind\r\nThe sun separates me\r\nExposed... our greatest fear\r\nAll is here to see\r\nPiece by piece you strip away\r\nExploring the escape\r\nEndless lives whispering by... so fast\r\nCirculate\r\nThis is the beginning of my life\r\nI hope you enjoy the show... it's for you, ya know?\r\nTo watch you from across the room\r\nTo hear you through the tangled lines... it completes me\r\nI've been waiting\r\nThe blot in my eyes...\r\nCirculate\r\nComputer simulation complete\r\nEject the suspect...\r\nMold and shape to create memory\r\nBring them back I say...\r\nSights set on the uncommon agenda\r\nWell done\r\nComputer simulation complete\r\nEject the suspect...\r\nMold and shape\r\nI won't remember me\r\nI won't remember us\r\nI won't remember he\r\nI won't remember them\r\nEyes covered by an electrical storm\r\nVoltage increasing, distance engaging... a mumbling timbre\r\nSilent to this awakening\r\nI'm sorry... a fucking tragedy\r\nA mumbling timbre\r\nSmash... ignite... destroy...\r\nThe tunnel's twisting this body into glass\r\nA once hollow man... break through to the other side\r\nExploring the escape\r\nEndless lives whispering by... so fast\r\nCirculate\r\nThe blot in my eyes...\r\nCircular\r\nThe blot in my eyes...\r\nCirculate"
