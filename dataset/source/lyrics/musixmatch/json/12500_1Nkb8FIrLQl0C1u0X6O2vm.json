  "lyrics": "We're in the church house kneeling down\r\nWe're in the subways underground\r\nWe're in the bars and on the street\r\nWe drive a truck, we walk a beat\r\nWe're in the mills and factories\r\nWe make the steel, we cut the trees\r\nA thousand-yard stare, eyes of glass\r\nBut we will see you when you pass\r\n♪\r\nWe lost our homes, we lost our dreams\r\nAll our goals have turned into schemes\r\nWe hurt each other and ourselves\r\nSo after long, traumatic spells\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking wounded\r\n♪\r\nWe cried out from the deepest pit\r\nBut rise back up each time we're hit\r\nWe fell from power and from grace\r\nBut resurrection's in our face\r\nWe're just like little girls and boys\r\nWe play with grown up toys\r\nWe never thought of sink or swim\r\nMy brother hurts me so I hurt him\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking wounded\r\n♪\r\nLike a circle, round and round\r\nWe go up so we come down\r\nWe don't explain or apologize\r\nWe pull the veil across our eyes\r\nWe see through your fake refrain\r\nBut we won't let you see our pain\r\nYou may not know us but you will see\r\nThere are more than you'd believe\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking\r\nWe are the walking (a thousand hours of glass)\r\nWe are the walking (see our past)\r\nWe are the walking wounded"
