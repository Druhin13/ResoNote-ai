  "lyrics": "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\r\nMy mum woke my dad up and said \"it's time to leave\"\r\nSo they jumped in the old Caprice\r\nAnd tore off into the night\r\nOn the 4th of July\r\nThey flew through the darkness\r\nDriving like Jehu\n\nAnd they rolled into Ottumwa\r\nBefore the sun begun to rise\r\nOn the 4th of July\r\nAnd in walks Bob and Janice\r\nRachel's on her way\n\nTo peek in through the window\r\nHoping to hear her grandson cry\r\nOn the 4th of July\r\n♪\r\nMy mother watched the fireworks\r\nFrom her hospital bed\r\nAnd after it was all over\r\nShe held me for the first time\r\nOn the 5th of July\r\nI've got my mother's brown eyes\r\nAnd my dad's quiet way\r\nAnd Grandma Rachel's love for music\r\nThe morning I arrived\r\nOn the 5th of July\r\nDeep in Iowa country\r\nIn a Heavenly Hideaway\r\nOn the shores of Lake Rathbun\r\nMy folks brought me home\r\nOn the 5th of July\r\n♪\r\nThat was when (that was when)\r\nLife began (life began) for me\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\r\nThat was when (that was when)\r\nLife began (life began) for me\r\nA teacher and a mechanic\r\nBrought me into this world\r\nThey loved me with all their hearts\r\nSince the day I opened my eyes\r\nOn the 5th of July\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\r\nThat was when (that was when)\r\nLife began (life began) for me\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh\r\nThat was when (that was when)\r\nLife began (life began) for me\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\r\nOoh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh"
