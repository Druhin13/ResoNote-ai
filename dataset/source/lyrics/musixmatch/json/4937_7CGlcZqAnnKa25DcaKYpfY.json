  "lyrics": "Oh, wherever you go\r\nYou know I will follow you\r\nYou know I will run to you\r\nOh, the sun and the moon\r\nIt don't matter what you do\r\nYou know I will run to you\r\nCаn't believe in all this time, I'm hurting for you\r\nBut you feel like home, home\r\nThe love you give, it lifts so high, I'm dying for it\r\nI'm dying for it, and I can't let you go\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nOr you lose, or you lose\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nOr you lose, or you lose\r\nIf you hide away, I'll hunt you down\r\nAnd follow you to the end of the Earth\r\nMy heart beats with yours\r\nMy lungs breathe with yours\r\nYou're a piece of me\r\nI can't hide away\r\nOh, I'm under your spell\r\nHeart aching and I'm fading\r\nAnd nobody can see\r\nI'm your heartbeat\r\nYou're a part of me\r\nCаn't believe in all this time, I'm hurting for you\r\nBut you feel like home, home\r\nThe love you give, it lifts so high, I'm dying for it\r\nI'm dying for it, and I can't let you go\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nOr you lose, or you lose\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nHide away, hide away from me\r\nOr you lose, or you lose"
