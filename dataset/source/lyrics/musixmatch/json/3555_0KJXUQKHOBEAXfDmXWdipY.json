  "lyrics": "I got the strobing lights, pocket full of dreams\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nWho spreads his wings and flies\r\nThrough the colors of the night\r\nWe got the stars up high, wild fantasies\r\nGoing through our minds\r\nReady to be satisfied\r\nUnder the purple sky\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nI got the strobing lights, pocket full of dreams\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nWho spreads his wings and flies\r\nThrough the colors of the night\r\nWe got the stars up high, wild fantasies\r\nGoing through our minds\r\nReady to be satisfied\r\nUnder the purple sky\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nI'm a butterfly\r\nI'm a butterfly"
