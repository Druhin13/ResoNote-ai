  "lyrics": "I could build a mansion that is higher than the trees\r\nI could have all the gifts I want and never ask please\r\nI could fly to Paris, it's at my beck and calls\r\nWhy do I live my life alone with nothing at all?\r\nAnd when I dream, I dream of you\r\nMaybe someday you will come true\r\nBut when I dream, I dream of you\r\nMaybe someday you will come true\r\nâ™ª\r\nI can be the singer or the clown in any room\r\nI can call up someone to take me to the moon\r\nI can put my makeup on and drive the man insane\r\nI can go to bed alone and never know his name\r\nAnd when I dream, I dream of you\r\nMaybe someday you will come true\r\nBut when I dream, I dream of you\r\nMaybe someday you will come true"
