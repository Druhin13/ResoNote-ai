  "lyrics": "From the pallet walled temple, beneath the overpass\r\nChalice smoke exhalation engulfs the freeway up above\r\nUp from the milk crate throne, on the Sabbath Day walks alone\r\nDown to the bosque on day of Iommic Pentacost\r\n♪\r\nHelms the shopping cart chariot along the access roads arroyo\r\nCart moored to tree\r\nProceeds the Creek Hippy\r\nThe rifftree is risen the bong is to live in\r\n♪\r\nAn ounce of day, lightens the way\r\nSalutations to the cultivators\r\nThe Kiefsatz Hasherach now takes the Bong Jabbar\r\n♪\r\nRifftual commences 'round the tree stump altar\r\nBong Water of Life anoints the Muad' Doob messiah\r\nThe pterodactyl flies again\r\n♪\r\nO'er emerald fields\r\n♪\r\nThe CBDeacon\r\n♪\r\nMarijuana is his light and his salvation\r\n♪\r\nHarvest sustains the altitude within\r\nEnds the rationing hocks the Ohaus Triple Beam\r\nThe chalice cup billows as the freedom song sung\r\n♪\r\nAscends to the shanty with the smoke filled lung\r\nBless the indica fields\r\nGrateful for the yield"
