  "lyrics": "The door is open to go through\r\nIf I could I would come too\r\nBut the path is made by you\r\nAs you're walking start singing and stop talking\r\nOh, if I could hear myself when I say\r\nOh, love is bigger than anything in its way\n\n♪\r\nSo young to be the words of your own song\r\nI know the rage in you is strong\r\nWrite a world where we can belong\r\nTo each other and sing it like no other\r\nOh, if I could hear myself when I say\r\nOh, love is bigger than anything in it's way\r\n♪\r\nIf the moonlight caught you crying on Killiney Bay\r\nOh sing your song\r\nLet your song be sung\r\nIf you listen you can hear the silence say\r\nWhen you think you're done\r\nYou've just begun\r\n♪\r\nLove is bigger than anything in its way\r\nLove is bigger than anything in its way\r\nLove is bigger than anything in its way"
