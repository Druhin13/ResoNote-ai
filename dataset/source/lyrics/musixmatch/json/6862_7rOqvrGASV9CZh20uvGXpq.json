  "lyrics": "I know it's been a while since our eyes last met\r\nToo many words were left unsaid\r\nYour head was poking out of the driver's seat\r\nEyes full of tears, I couldn't leave\r\nNo matter what I do I still feel you coming back to me\r\nWhen I know that you never will\r\nSo before I say goodbye, would you do one last thing for me?\r\nBe happy\r\n♪\r\nAnd take, take her to the moon for me\r\nTake her like you promised me\r\nSay you love her every time\r\nLike how you told me the last time\r\nSomeday I know we'll meet again\r\nIn heaven by the rainbow's end\r\nAnd I only wish you happiness\r\nUntil we meet again\r\n♪\r\nWish I could stick around and fight back your tears\r\nTell you, \"My love, I'm still here\"\r\nSomeday we'll understand why I had to leave\r\nBut for now I need you to set me free\r\nNo matter what I do I still feel you coming back to me\r\nWhen I know that you never will\r\nSo before I say goodbye, would you do one last thing for me?\r\nBe happy\r\n♪\r\nAnd take, take her to the moon for me\r\nTake her like you promised me\r\nSay you love her every time\r\nLike how you told me the last time\r\nSomeday I know we'll meet again\r\nIn heaven by the rainbow's end\r\nAnd I only wish you happiness\r\nUntil we meet again\r\nNo matter where you are\r\nYou'll always have my heart\r\nNo matter where you are\r\nI'll love you from afar\r\nNo matter where you are\r\nYou'll always have my heart\r\nNo matter where you are\r\nI'll love you from afar\n\nYou have my heart\r\n♪\r\nSo be happy\r\n♪\r\nDon't be afraid to be happy\r\nAnd take, take her to the moon for me\r\n♪\r\nTake her like you promised me\r\nSay you love her every time\r\nLike how you told me the last time\r\nSomeday I know we'll meet again\r\nIn heaven by the rainbow's end\r\nAnd I only wish you happiness\r\nUntil we meet again"
