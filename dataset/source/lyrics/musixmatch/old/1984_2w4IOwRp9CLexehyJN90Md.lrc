Making the distinction between life and lore
Odds favor the former when you wear a mask
Masochism forming in the reflection
And I'm trying not to turn into a psychopath
Better to have lost it then to find it tossed out
That's what I'm telling myself, wasn't I better than nothing?

Making a decision about steamed or fried
Wanted to be needed so I fed my cat
Think I'll keep to myself for the next few days
Feel a buzz that can't be bottled, smoked or canned
Sabotaging life just to find something to write about
Why was it always this way? And did I do it on purpose?
â™ª
Waking from a vision that the schizoid built
Listening to puddles swallow melted snow
Spring has sprung and finally it's not cold outside
And I'm thinking about the places that I want to go
Passion dissipates when it's fastened
to the faces we wear only to become them
Lying to ourselves everyday becomes incredibly easy
Yes, incredibly easy
Yes, incredibly easy
