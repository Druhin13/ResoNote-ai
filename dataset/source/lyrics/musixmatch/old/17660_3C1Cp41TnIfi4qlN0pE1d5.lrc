I wait up
To see your face
I've had enough
And now I'm out of the race
And we both went wrong
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
I want you
I want you
I want you
I know that you're different
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
Taking your clothes off
Cause you're comfortable in my room
Trying to hold off
While I hold onto you
And we both went wrong
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
I want you
I want you
I want you
I know that you're different
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
She said I love you
I love you
I love you
I love that you're different
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha

I know that you're different

Oh I, I know that you're different
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
I want you
I want you
I want you
I know that you're different
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
She said I love you
I love you
I love you
I love that you're different
Aha ha aha, aha ha aha
I know that you're different
I know that you're different
There's a hurricane of roses on my back
Hands on the dashboard don't look back
There's a hurricane of roses on my back
