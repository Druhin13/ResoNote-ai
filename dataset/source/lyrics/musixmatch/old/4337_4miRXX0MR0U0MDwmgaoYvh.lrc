I can see you when the clouds move slowly
Your features in a sky wide open
For just the two of us
I know there's something bigger to this
Deeper than a thousand oceans
Underneath me as I take my moment
Here just to say it all
I'll break your fall
We'll make it "through it all"
We'll make it "through it all"
And I won't let you fall
