The moment we all fall apart tonight
Hate it or love it, it's allright
Cause we ain't got no ground to build things up
Endlessy talking, we so stuck
We owned it, but
We lost it, burn
The fire
Cause we will go up into flames
We owned it, but
We lost it, burn
The fire
Cause we will go up into flames
The memories that we had
We can't go on, we can't go on
There's nothing fighting for
Not longer in my bed
We can't go on, we can't go on
There's nothing fighting for
As soon as you are walking out that door
You not see my crying no more
Cause if it's like you cut me with a knife
Fast and deep down what is my life
We owned it, but
We lost it, burn
The fire
Cause we will go into flames
We owned it, but
We lost it, burn
The fire
Cause we will go up into flames
The memories that we had
We can't go on, we can't go on
There's not fighting for
Not longer in my bed
We can't go on, we can't go on
There's nothing fighting for
