Take this fainted heart
Take these tainted hands
Wash me in your live
Come like grace again
Take this fainted heart
Take these tainted hands
Wash me in your live
Come like grace again
(Take) this fainted heart
Take these tainted hands
(Wash) me in your live
Come like grace again
Take this fainted heart

Take these tainted hands
Wash me in your live
Come like grace again
