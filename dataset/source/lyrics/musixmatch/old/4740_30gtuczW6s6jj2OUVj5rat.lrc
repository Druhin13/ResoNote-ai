I got something in the way
I'm losing hold on reality
And it all falls into place
But I'll die slow if I can't escape

Knocked out
When you're around
Knocked out
Knocked out
When you're around
Knocked out
Knocked out
â™ª
When I close my eyes it's fine
And I don't wanna be hurt
But I don't wanna be blind
Knocked out
When you're around
Knocked out
Knocked out
When you're around
Knocked out
Knocked out
I don't wanna be blind, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be blind, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be blind, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be blind
