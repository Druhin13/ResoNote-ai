No, I'm here to stay\n\nI'm really great, but don't discriminate\n\n'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face\n\nYou stickin' out your chest, your titties fake\n\nDon't make me pick your fate\n\nI'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced\n\nThe heart was built to break\n\nI'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake\n\nI got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case\n\nMy killers straight, let's do some Q & A\n\nYou saw the news today\n\nGot news to break and rules to break\n\nIt hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break\n\nIt's worth the wait, commercial break\n\n\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)\n\nOut of all the wrinkles, I was chosen\n\nWhen all of the lights, they get low\n\nAnd all of the curtains they close\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)\n\n\n\nG-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code\n\nWe bros (can't be broken)\n\nWe bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code\n\n(Can't be broken)",

All right, man, light it up, homes !\r\n- Ok, check it out man !\n\n[Strofa 1] - B-Real\n\n\n\nI'm the original Dr. Green, thumb the rest and lie us\n\nI'm the one with the prescription to get you higher\n\nI got every type of weed that you might desire\n\nGo ahead, fire it up, maybe you can get inspired\n\nAny kind of flavor you savor\n\nI can do you the favor\n\nJust as long as you share with your neighbor\n\nSome like the Sour Deep, that's an east coast way\n\nBut on the west coast we all know KUSH is queen\n\nSome of y'all will smoke anything, but me, I'm picky\n\nI throw it out if I don't see that it's green and sticky\n\nNo stress, no bush, I'm pushing the KUSH\n\nWhen I harvest... (?)... I'm the king of the bang like the Nike swoosh\n\nI'm over the world, in case you wonder\n\nI smoked everywhere I went, they call me the weed hunter\n\nBut no one does it better like we do in Cali\n\nJust ask one of my patients cause they always tell me that the...\n\n\n\n[Refren]\n\n\n\nK.U.S.H. keeps us so high\n\nThe K.U.S.H. keeps us so high\n\nThe more I smoke, the high I get\n\nThe better I feel, I can't quit\n\nThe more I smoke, the high I get\n\nThe better I feel, I can't quit\n\n\n\n[Strofa 2] - B-Real\n\n\n\n\n\nKottonmouth Kings are down with us\n\nSnoop Dogg and Dre are down with us\n\nCheech and Chong, they're down with us\n\nBut the DEA, they can get the nuts\n\nOn a hard times cover, you might see us\n\nTaking hits from the bong with the April song\n\nWith weed so strong, that knockout King Kong\n\nHit it one good time... Your mind's gone\n\nYour eyes get red, and your mouth goes dry\n\nJust get me when you want more and I'll supply\n\nRed and me... (?)... gets stoned and said How High\n\nThey said high enough to touch gal and kiss the sky\n\nThat's a... (?)... But I think I got what you need\n\nI got to move the thought and I'm ready to feed\n\nSo, follow my lead I got the gifts to bring\n\nIt's an everyday life for the Reepa King\n\n\n\n[Refren]\n\n\n\n[Strofa 3] - B-Real\n\n\n\nI got the cream of the crop\n\nMy crop means cream\n\nWhen it's time to bag it up\n\nBuy a several ... (?)...\n\nWe're like the Yankees, most winning, grand champs of the earth\n\nNothing gets you like the type of medicine I serve\n\nLawyers, teachers, actors, street cleaners\n\nNo matter what they are, they all come to see the Reepa\n\nThey stay high 24 like Keefa\n\nI tell 'em don't hit too hard, this is a Creepa\n\nBody Hamilson is down with us\n\nBruce Willis smoke all, he's down with us\n\nYeah, Willie Nelson is down with us\n\nWho the fuck you think drives the ganja bus?\n\nD.R. Morwitch, she's down with us\n\nShe got popped at the airport with joints and such\n\nSo if anyone asks, she's down with us\n\nAnd you don't wanna inna more weed in the Cannabis cup\n\nI'm Greenton, I bring supreme son\n\nThat strange bended in mind, I've never seen one\n\nThe K.U.S.H. keeps us so high that you can't concentrate\n\nDave Chapelle, is down with us\n\nHalle Barry, too, but don't tell no one\n\nKRS One is down with us\n\nHe's a blood gettïng smoked and he can't wake up\n\n\n\n[Refren]",

You're getting picked on in school\r\nThe other boys! (Huh!)! They say you just ain't cool\r\nWell that's bullshit! (Yeah!!) We're gonna teach you the rules\r\nThose motherfuckers ain't gonna bother you no more\n\n\n\nWe are the bad boys (Oh!) from the tough side of town\n\nWe are the Cool Patrol (Woo!) we'll turn your life around\n\nThose bullies (AW SHIT) their ass is done for now\n\nWe're gonna show you how! So fuckin' listen y'all! First…\n\n\n\nYou put your hands in the air\n\nAnd you jump off the ground\n\nAnd then you take that funky butt and you shake it all around\n\nAnd lightly jog in place and then crank it up to a prance\n\nThis is the cool patrol dance\n\n\n\nNow put your hands in your pockets\n\nAnd take them right back out\n\nThen spin around in a circle and make an animal sound (moo)\n\nThen glide into the sprinkler like you're gonna water the plants\n\nThis is the cool patrol dance\n\n\n\nWhee!\n\n\n\nYou get all that kid?\n\n\n\n(Jacksepticeye) That wasn't actually very helpful... That was like an instructional dance...\n\n\n\nHell yeah...!\n\n\n\nMotherfuckin' bullies better watch their ass\n\nYou're sending all them shits a message there's a new king in class\n\nWhen they see you they're gonna freak out and piss their pants\n\nTHEY ARE YOUR BITCHES! THEY ARE YOUR BITCHES BECAUSE...\n\n\n\nYou put your hands in the air\n\nAnd then stick out your rear end\n\nAnd then you wiggle it real hard and you hug your closest friend\n\nAnd then you wildly remove your clothes and tearaway pants\n\nThis is the cool patrol dance\n\n\n\nNow rub the peanut butter on you\n\nFrom your head to your feet\n\nAnd cover up your nudity with different cheeses and meats\n\nThen slap a camel because this could be your only chance\n\nThis is the cool patrol dance\n\n\n\nCool Break!\n\n\n\nAlright...\n\nThis is cool... *coughs* 'scuse me...\n\nHey I have an idea!\n\nLet's kick it!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou put your hands in the air\n\nAnd grab a bird from the sky\n\nAnd eat it whole so that you may absorb its power of flight\n\nNow you can also dive bomb fish because your vision's enhanced\n\nThis is the cool patrol dance\n\n\n\nYou're basically a superhero now\n\nSo throw some cars\n\nThen rub your magnum thighs together and set fire to Mars\n\nNow harness all your sexy fury in a victory stance\n\nThis is the cool patrol dance!\n\n\n\nYour training is complete, now go show those fuckers who's boss!\n\n\n\n[The Kid] Okay! Hey guys, listen up... You put your hands in the a-\n\n\n\n*punch*\n\n\n\nOH GOD!!! Aw he might... he might actually be dead....",

Ravens fly!\n\n\n\nWar!\n\n\n\nHeading to Northumbraland\n\nCome what may we won't back down\n\nWhen horns of war begin to sound\n\nAella's head will lose its crown\n\n\n\nCome what may, we hold our heads\n\nUp to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as Odin's on our side\n\n\n\nWe hold our heads up to the sky\n\nAnd know that we will never die\n\nAs long as we stand side by side\n\nAs long as we can see the ravens fly!\n\nRavens fly!
