  "lyrics": "Before we ever seize the day\r\nThe calming of the season's end\r\nLife becomes a hidden play\r\nImparted with a furtive glance\r\nWas it everything you'd dreamed it'd be\r\nOr illusions shattered into glass\n\n\n\nWorld be gone\n\nOr are you filled with loving\n\nThe way that you promised us\n\nLong ago\n\nAnd will it tie us to the mast of our souls\n\nAs in ancient lore\n\nAnd as I saw you standing there\n\nHolding your head in your hands\n\n\n\nThough it hurts to say goodbye\n\nSilver linings in the leaden sky\n\nOne day we'll return again\n\nAnd surely we will make amends\n\nConsequences never seen\n\nBroken shadows on an empty screen\n\n\n\nWorld be gone\n\nOr are you filled with loving\n\nThe way that you promised us\n\nLong ago\n\nAnd will it tie us to the mast of our souls\n\nAs in ancient lore\n\nAnd as I saw you standing there\n\nHolding your head in your hands\n\n\n\nWorld be gone\n\nOr are you filled with loving\n\nThe way that you promised us\n\nLong ago\n\nAnd will it tie us to the mast of our souls\n\nAs in ancient lore\n\nAnd as I saw you standing there\n\nHolding your head in your hands",
