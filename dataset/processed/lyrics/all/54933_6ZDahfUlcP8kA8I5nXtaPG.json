  "lyrics": "They told me I would see the truth, but how much time will it take\r\nI see memories in your mind are overcrowded with hate\r\nI thought I caught a glimpse of joy, but it was an honest mistake\r\nI see the pain in your heart right through that smile on your face\r\nI and just can’t take it homie, I see you aiming for greatness\r\nAnd I think you’ll make it homie, trying to be patient while pacing But time is racing homie, I see these other busters hating on me\n\nThey say I’m fake and phony so what yo they don’t know me\n\nAs proud as you seem, you’re doubting your dreams\n\nTripping off cowards you’d devour just empowered by greed\n\nSpending hours in the shower while it’s crowded with steam\n\nWipe off the mirror and fill it with the loudest of screams\n\nI’m yellin\n\n\n\nI hear what you tell me but\n\nYou gon have to show me\n\nIf you don’t like me, well\n\nYou don’t know me at all\n\nI’m sure I can save you\n\nHero I must be\n\nBut you don’t like me, well\n\nI’m a make you love me\n\n\n\nHere we go again you and I\n\nStanding in this mirror once again Contemplating suicide\n\nWatching one another cry, wiping up each others eyes\n\nNo one else around to talk me down, maybe you can try\n\nThat’s what it’s like when no one’s willing to help\n\nI guess I’m my own therapist, I’m healing myself\n\nLike Antonio tell me all those feelings you felt\n\nWhen you had to talk yourself out of killing yourself\n\nDid the mission on my own, definition of alone\n\nHad to be the father figure I was missing all along\n\nHad a vision of a throne, where I would sit when I was grown\n\nPainting pictures of my pain to the rhythm of this song\n\n\n\nI hear what you tell me but\n\nYou gon have to show me\n\nIf you don’t like me, well\n\nYou don’t know me at all\n\nI’m sure I can save you\n\nHero I must be\n\nBut you don’t like me, well\n\nI’m a make you love me\n\n\n\nThen I opened up my eyes and no one was there\n\nSo I guess it’s time to end it now I’m growing a pair\n\nReally felt like I could do it even though I was scared\n\nYou see the thing that hurts the most is thinking no one would care\n\nThen I heard something say, whenever you’re through crying\n\nI’ll give you everything you need, just trust me in due time\n\nThere’s heaven and a hell and a world in between\n\nI see the apple of your eye but here’s the girl of your dreams\n\nI was blessed with a family I didn’t understand it\n\nI have the best son in the world, the greatest woman on the planet\n\nThis treasure I’ve just been handed, I’ll never take it for granted\n\nI was famished; I was damaged and ended up with an advantage\n\nBuilding lessons for my son checking off my list\n\nI’ll teach him about gain, I’ll teach him about risk\n\nI’ll tell him about pain, I’ll tell him about bliss\n\nWhenever he sheds tears I’ll hug him and tell him this\n\n\n\nI hear what you tell me allow me to show you\n\nIf they don’t like you, they don’t know you\n\nRemember you saved me, hero you must be\n\nCause I didn’t like me, but you made me love me",
