  "lyrics": "Whenever dark has fallen\r\nYou know the spirit of the party\r\nStarts to come alive\r\nUntil the day is dawning\r\nYou can throw out all your blues\r\nAnd hit the city lights\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\n\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\n\nSo gimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\n\n\nYou need the evening action\n\nA place to dine, a glass of wine\n\nA little late romance\n\nIt's a chain reaction\n\nYou'll see the people of the world\n\nComing out to dance\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\n\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\n\nSo gimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\n\n\nSo come on out tonight\n\nAnd we'll lead the others\n\nOn a ride through paradise\n\nAnd if you feel all right\n\nThen we can be lovers\n\n'Cause I see that starlight\n\nLook in your eyes\n\nDon't you know we can fly\n\nJust gimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\n\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\n\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\n\nSo gimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\n\n\nSo come on out tonight\n\nAnd we'll lead the others\n\nOn a ride through paradise\n\nAnd if you feel all right\n\nThen we can be lovers\n\n'Cause I see that starlight\n\nLook in your eyes\n\nDon't you know we can fly\n\n\n\nAnd if we stay together\n\nWe'll feel the rhythm of the evening\n\nTaking us up high\n\nNever mind the weather\n\nWe'll be dancing in the street\n\nUntil the morning light\n\n'Cause there's music in the air\n\nAnd lots of lovin' everywhere\n\nSo gimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\nGimme the night\n\nSo, gimme the night",
