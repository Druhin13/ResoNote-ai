  "lyrics": "My telephone, it doesn't have a camera\r\nIf it did I’d take a picture of myself\r\nIf it did I'd take a picture of the water\r\nAnd the man on the offramp\r\nHolding up the sign that's asking me for help\n\nI got a job and I’ll work here for the summer\n\nI fold the towels and set them by the pool\n\nEveryone looks happy with each other\n\n'Til they step away and say the thing they really meant\n\nThey always sound so cruel\n\n\n\nI didn't know what I was in for\n\nWhen I signed up for that run\n\nThere's no way I'm curing cancer\n\nBut I'll sweat it out\n\nI feel so proud now for all the good I've done\n\n\n\nI know a girl who owns a boutique in the city\n\nSelling clothes to the fashionably late\n\nSays she cries at the news but doesn't really\n\n’Cause it’s too much fun, it's too much time\n\nAnd too much plastic money to be made\n\n\n\nI didn’t know what I was in for\n\nWhen they took my belt and strings\n\nThey told me I'd gone crazy\n\nMy arms are strapped in a straight jacket\n\nSo I couldn't save those TV refugees\n\n\n\nWhen they're on their backs\n\nIn a bloody bath\n\nFull of Sarin gas\n\nOn a screen\n\n\n\nI didn’t know what I was in for\n\nWhen I laid out in the sun\n\nWe get burned for being honest\n\nI've really never done anything, for anyone\n\n\n\nTo fall asleep I need white noise to distract me\n\nOtherwise I have to listen to me think\n\nOtherwise I pace around, hold my breath, let it out\n\nSit on the couch and think about\n\nHow living's just a promise that I made",
