  "lyrics": "I was a teenager, delusional\r\nWith such an awkward build\r\nThat's why the first time she sent me a look\r\nI swore she was my world\r\nA week later, got cheated on\r\nA pay-by-hour hotel\n\nI guess she thought that's what my future's worth\n\nA twenty dollar bill\n\nI damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes\n\nBut behind them I was burning\n\nNow I'm the lie\n\n\n\nI'm the cheapest thrill\n\nI'm the cheapest thrill\n\nAnd everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill\n\nAnd I can barely stand myself\n\n\n\nClearly I was crazy\n\nThe first to give advice\n\nPlayed it up like I was noble\n\nBut I was feeding my own pride\n\nThe lengths I'd go for a fix\n\nTacky charm got me far\n\nMust have hurt so many feelings\n\nWhile stabbing my own heart\n\nI damn the world, shooting fire from my eyes\n\nBut behind them I was burning\n\nNow I'm the lie\n\n\n\nI'm the cheapest thrill\n\nI'm the cheapest thrill\n\nAnd everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill\n\nAnd I can barely stand myself\n\n\n\nSuddenly I can see through my own eyes again\n\nBut I don't like what I'm feeling\n\nYou can't help your thoughts\n\nBut you can change your actions\n\nIf I don't I'll be consumed\n\n\n\nNow I'm the cheapest thrill\n\nI'm the cheapest thrill\n\nAnd everyone can tell that I'm the cheapest thrill\n\nAnd I can barely stand myself\n\nI know now I'm not going back\n\nI know my own worth now\n\n(And I can barely stand myself)\n\nI know now I'm not going back\n\nI know my own worth now\n\n(And I can barely stand myself)\n\nI know now I'm not going back\n\nI know my own worth now\n\n(I'm the cheapest thrill)\n\nI'm the cheapest thrill",
