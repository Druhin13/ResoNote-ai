  "lyrics": "I tried to scale the skies\r\nI threw my best of tries\r\nTo hit the grandest heights\r\nBut I barely scraped the ceiling\r\nI paid in blood and tears\n\nI played with sweat and years\n\nGave all with no return\n\nAnd my soul could only ask\n\n\n\nWhat do I do when my best\n\nReally isn't good enough\n\nWhen I've given my all\n\nBut find myself in free fall\n\n\n\nI'll bite the cold\n\nHangin' for a higher love\n\n'Cause in the thick of it all\n\nI'll find you in the free fall\n\n\n\nFree fall\n\nSpinnin' like a storm and I\n\nCan't stop\n\nTrippin' over clouds and my\n\nHeart goes\n\nDivin' like a bullet to find you\n\nI find you in the free fall\n\n\n\nSpinnin' like a storm and I\n\nCan't stop\n\nTrippin' over clouds and my\n\nHeart goes\n\nDivin' like a bullet to find you\n\nI find you in the free fall\n\n\n\nClean air to clear my thoughts\n\n(As I)\n\nBreathe out my aching faults\n\n(Right now)\n\nI'm inches from the floor\n\nBut I've never felt so fearless\n\n\n\nI wonder as I float\n\n(Perhaps)\n\nIt's good to lose control\n\n(Somehow)\n\nBut when it hurts so bad\n\nThen my soul can only ask\n\nMy soul can only ask\n\n\n\nWhat do I do when my best\n\nReally isn't good enough\n\n(Not good enough no)\n\nWhen I've given my all\n\n(Yeah)\n\nBut find myself in free fall\n\n\n\nI'll bite the cold\n\n(Iâ€™ll bite the cold)\n\nHangin' for a higher love\n\n'Cause in the thick of it all\n\nI'll find you in the free fall\n\n\n\nFree fall\n\nSpinnin' like a storm and I\n\nCan't stop\n\nTrippin' over clouds and my\n\nHeart goes\n\nDivin' like a bullet to find you\n\nI find you in the free fall\n\n\n\nSpinnin' like a storm and I\n\nCan't stop\n\nTrippin' over clouds and my\n\nHeart goes\n\nDivin' like a bullet to find you\n\nI find you in the free fall\n\n\n\nI find you in the free fall\n\nI find you",
