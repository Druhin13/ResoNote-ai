  "lyrics": "The way you stand there in your three striped shell toes and\r\nThe way your hair dances, it's clear you want all eyes on you\r\nIt's all eyes on you\r\nAnd though I know that I won't get no answers, I\r\nI just can't stop from indulging my lean eyes on you\r\nMy fool eyes on you\n\n\n\nAs you dance on your burning clothes\n\nI feel the bullet holes\n\nTell myself I've got nothing to lose\n\nThough your touch gives me vertigo, I'm like a domino\n\nDarling I keep falling back to you\n\n\n\nBut if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?\n\nYou pull me closer\n\nYou say you miss the way I hold ya\n\nI feel you breathing on my shoulder\n\nWhy do you stop me getting sober?\n\n\n\nYou leave your sweet bitter taste on my tongue and\n\nYou leave your smoke to seep deep into my lungs\n\nI know how you're taking hold\n\nMy love is wasted and somehow you laced it\n\nAnd I'm on my knees\n\nThere's no remedy\n\n\n\nAs you dance on your burning clothes\n\nI feel the bullet holes\n\nTell myself I've got nothing to lose\n\nThough your touch gives me vertigo, I'm like a domino\n\nDarling I keep falling back to you\n\n\n\nBut if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?\n\nYou pull me closer\n\nYou say you miss the way I hold ya\n\nI feel you breathing on my shoulder\n\nWhy do you stop me getting sober?\n\n\n\nNa na na, na na na\n\nNa na na na\n\nNa na na, na na na\n\nNa na na na\n\n\n\nBut if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?\n\nYou pull me closer\n\nYou say you miss the way I hold ya\n\nSo if it's over, why do you stop me getting sober on your love?\n\nYou pull me closer\n\nYou say you miss the way I hold ya\n\nI feel you breathing on my shoulder\n\n(Na na na, na na na\n\nNa na na na)\n\nWhy do you stop me getting sober?\n\n(Na na na, na na na\n\nNa na na na)\n\nWhy do you stop me getting sober?",
