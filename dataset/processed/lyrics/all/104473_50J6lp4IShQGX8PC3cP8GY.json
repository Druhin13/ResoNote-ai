  "lyrics": "Blue is all I've ever really known\r\nPlaying records that I couldn't own\r\nWalking fast into the ticket line\r\nWalking slow to save a lonely night\r\nI'm sweeping up at 9 a.m\n\nUnable to pay my rent\n\nAcross the bar, beneath the mess of alcohol and cigarettes\n\nThere's ten more hours of life I missed\n\nBut I don't even need them back 'cause I found you\n\n\n\nYeah, found\n\nI can't believe I get to know you\n\nWoah, I can't believe I get to show you\n\nI had no one 'til I found you\n\n'Til I found you\n\n\n\nEarly mornin' in the market place\n\nFreezing rain falling in my face\n\nHeavy sky on the same old town\n\nHeavy head, I'm slowly breaking down\n\n\n\nI'm sweeping up at 9 a.m\n\nUnable to pay my rent\n\nAnd across the bar, beneath the mess of alcohol and cigarettes\n\nThere's ten more hours of life I missed\n\nBut I don't even need them back 'cause I found you\n\n\n\nI found you\n\nI found you\n\nNo I can't believe I get to know you\n\nWoah, I can't believe I get to show you\n\nSee, I had no one\n\n'Til I found you\n\n'Til I found you\n\n'Til I really found you\n\n\n\nWhen I found you\n\nWhen I found you\n\nThere wasn't nothing left that wasn't love\n\nSinking deeper, sinking like a stone\n\nWhen I found you\n\nWhen I found you\n\nI needed you more than I'll ever know\n\nSlippin' deeper, deeper\n\n\n\nI can't believe I get to know you\n\nNo, I can't believe I get to show you\n\nI had no one 'til I found you\n\n'Til I found you\n\nOh 'til I really found you\n\n\n\nI can't believe I get to know you\n\nNo, I can't believe I get to show, \n\nShow you\n\nI had no one\n\nI had no one \n\n'Til I found you",
