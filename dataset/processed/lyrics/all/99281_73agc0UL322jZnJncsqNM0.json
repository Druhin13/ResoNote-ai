  "lyrics": "I bark, you bite\r\nWhatever it is, it ain't right\r\nIt's not intentional, but tension is running high\r\nMy time, your world\r\nI sit back and watch it unfurl\r\nThey can't blame me because I'm worried about my girl\n\n\n\nWe fight every night and day\n\nAnd make for it right away\n\nThis is driving me insane\n\nBut I still love you anyway\n\nYeah anywhere you want to put it\n\nBite my tongue or bite the bullet\n\nSaid a couple things I shouldn't\n\nI would take back if I could\n\n\n\nIf things fall apart again\n\nI know you know we can go back to being just friends\n\nMay feel like we're wrong in the end but\n\nI know you know we can go back to being just friends\n\nWe can go back to being just friends\n\n\n\nSpeak once, think twice\n\nLooks like you put me on ice\n\nThe ice is melting every time we dim the lights\n\nI'm dim-witted, deal with it\n\nYou said something slick I didn't get it\n\nAnd now I wonder if our love is counterfeit\n\n\n\nAll these questions on my mind\n\nIs this all some sort of sign?\n\nIs this love or am I blind\n\nOr are we headed for decline?\n\nI decline to answer that\n\nBut I'm inclined to state the facts\n\nWe stay on each other's back\n\nBecause opposites attract\n\n\n\nIf things fall apart again\n\nI know you know we can go back to being just friends\n\nMay feel like we're wrong in the end but\n\nI know you know we can go back to being just friends\n\nI know you know we can go back to being just friends\n\n\n\nI just can't forget when you're touching me right\n\nI melt in my head got me feeling so high\n\nThe aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up\n\nMay not be correct but I can't get enough\n\n\n\nI just can't forget when you're touching me right\n\nI melt in my head got me feeling so high\n\nThe aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up\n\nMay not be correct but I can't get enough\n\n\n\nI just can't forget when you're touching me right\n\nI melt in my head got me feeling so high\n\nThe aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up\n\nMay not be correct but I can't get enough\n\n\n\nI just can't forget when you're touching me right\n\nI melt in my head got me feeling so high\n\nThe aftereffect boy you're fuckin' me up\n\nMay not be correct but I can't get enough",
