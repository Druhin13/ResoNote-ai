  "lyrics": "The Flyers beat the Reds fair and square\r\nWhile up the coast some fled the devilâ€™s lair\r\nAn heiress was into her irons thrown\r\nWhile the family feuds exploded in our homes\r\nMoon collapsed in the garden\n\nVikings looted the plains\n\nSpirit of '76\n\nWe were such a tender age\n\n\n\nThe Mohican swore he would get organised\n\nTo clean the war forever from his mind\n\nA farmer came with peanuts in his hand\n\nThen wept a bit while waltzing to the band\n\n\n\nMoon collapsed in the garden\n\nVikings looted the plains\n\nSpirit of '76\n\nWe were such a tender age",
