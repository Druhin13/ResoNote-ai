  "lyrics": "Verse One (Kandi): \nEvery man wants a woman, \nWhere him and her can just go hang. \nJust the two of them along, kick back, \nDoing their own thing. \nAnd every man wants a woman, \n\nThat can always keep him in the mood. \n\nAnd I'm that kind of girl, \n\nSo this is what I tell my dude. \n\n\n\nChorus: \n\nI tell him to kick off your shoes and relax your feet, \n\nParty on down to the Xscape beat. \n\nJust kick it. \n\nJust kick it, just kick it. \n\n(Repeat x2) \n\n\n\nVerse Two (Kandi): \n\nEvery man wants a woman, \n\nThat can cook him up a good meal. \n\nA woman he can treat like his homie, \n\nAnd take her out on the Ave. and just chill. \n\nEvery man wants a woman, \n\nThat ain't good for just laying on her back. \n\n(LaTocha):And I'm that kind of woman, \n\n(Kandi):So before me and my man get in the sack... \n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus to fade",
