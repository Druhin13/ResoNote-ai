  "lyrics": "Diamond life, lover boy\r\nHe move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy\r\nCity lights and business nights\r\nWhen you require streetcar desire for higher heights\r\nNo place for beginners or sensitive hearts\r\nWhen sentiment is left to chance\n\nNo place to be ending but somewhere to start\n\n\n\nNo need to ask, he's a smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator\n\nCoast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male\n\nAcross the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale\n\nFace to face, each classic case\n\nWe shadow box and double cross\n\nYet need the chase\n\n\n\nA license to love, insurance to hold\n\nMelts all your memories and change into gold\n\nHis eyes are like angels but his heart is cold\n\nNo need to ask, he's a smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator\n\n\n\nCoast to coast, LA to Chicago, western male\n\nAcross the north and south, to Key Largo, love for sale\n\n\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator\n\nSmooth operator, smooth operator",
