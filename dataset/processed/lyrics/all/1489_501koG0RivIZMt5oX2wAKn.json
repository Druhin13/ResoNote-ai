  "lyrics": "You know that whatchu said\r\nCould mean a lot of things\r\nYou did it anyway\r\nJust to get a reaction\r\nI’ve been around the block\n\nEnough to know\n\nThat you did it all\n\nJust to be a distraction\n\n\n\nAnd even though that time goes on\n\nAnd you found someone new\n\nI never thought you were acting\n\n\n\nOn the come around\n\nYou'll be another one on your own\n\nNo one'll be laughing\n\n\n\nAnd I don't care\n\nAnd I feel fine\n\nAnd I have memories that you left behind\n\nAnd I get low\n\nAnd I get high\n\nTrying to stay clear of the changing tide\n\n\n\nNo turning my back to you\n\nNo turning my back to you\n\n\n\nWell you’ve been telling tales\n\nAnd I can overhear\n\nThat I don't fare well\n\nNow that you're up in a mansion\n\n\n\nBeen on the wrong side\n\nOf your bitterness\n\nToo many times before\n\nThis time I don't see it passing\n\n\n\nSo come on in\n\nWaters are warm\n\nPaddling out\n\nIn the eye of the storm\n\n\n\nSo come right in\n\nWaters are warm\n\nNo coming back\n\nWhen you're chasing the storm\n\n\n\nI hope that someday\n\nYou can make a change\n\nBut that's probably\n\nToo much to be asking\n\n\n\nOn the come around\n\nYou'll be another one on your own\n\nNo one'll be laughing",
