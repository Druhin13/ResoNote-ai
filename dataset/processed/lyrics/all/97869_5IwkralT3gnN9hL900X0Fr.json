  "lyrics": "And I crouch in the snow\r\nDon't wanna let the moment go\r\nKiss me on the tip of my nose\r\nCome home to my freshly folded up clothes\r\nI take the time that I'm given\n\nBlame it on myself\n\nSitting here reminiscing about the times that we've had\n\nTimes that were lost\n\nAnd I guess I'm holdin' on\n\n\n\n'Cause I only ever wanted to feel free\n\n'Cause money can't buy, buy all my happiness\n\nAnd don't you know I tried\n\nAnd I tried all of this\n\nAnd it don't mean a thing\n\n\n\nNo it don't mean\n\nNo it don't mean\n\nNo it don't mean\n\n\n\nNo, no, no",
