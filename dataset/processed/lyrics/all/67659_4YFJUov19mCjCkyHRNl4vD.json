  "lyrics": "Life is hard to understand\r\nWhen the fortune plays its game\r\nThe good guys leave, the bad ones stay\r\nI watch your eyes fading away\r\nAnd your voice whispers my name\r\nOne last time to hold your hand\n\n\n\nCalm down and sleep, calm down and sleep\n\nBreak free from reality\n\nThe bond became so special\n\nIt will never disappear\n\n\n\nOne last effort pushes the will\n\nand draws a smile on your face\n\nOvercoming all the strain\n\nEven fighting to find the way\n\nTo make it through another day\n\nThrough the darkness, through the pain\n\n\n\nCalm down and sleep, calm down and sleep\n\nBreak free from reality\n\nThe bond became so special\n\nIt will never disappear\n\n\n\nWe all got dues in life to pay\n\nBut it wasn't your time yet\n\nUntil we meet again farewell, my friend\n\n\n\nNothing lasts forever, it's a fact of life\n\nBut no mother should have to bury a son\n\nAn eternal memory will shine through\n\nBut no father should have to mourn the loss\n\n\n\n\n\nCalm down and sleep, calm down and sleep\n\nBreak free from reality\n\nThe bond became so special\n\nIt will never disappear\n\n\n\nWe all got dues in life to pay\n\nBut it wasn't your time yet\n\nUntil we meet again farewell, my friend.",
