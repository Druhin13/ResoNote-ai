  "lyrics": "Making the distinction between life and lore\r\nOdds favor the former when you wear a mask\r\nMasochism forming in the reflection and\r\nI’m trying not to turn into a psychopath\r\nBetter to have lost it then to find it tossed out\r\nThat’s what I’m telling myself\n\nWasn’t I better than nothing?\n\n\n\nMaking a decision about steamed or fried\n\nWanted to be needed so I fed my cat\n\nThink I’ll keep to myself for the next few days\n\nFeel a buzz that can’t be bottled, smoked or canned\n\nSabotaging life just to find something to write about\n\nWhy was it always this way?\n\nAnd did I do it on purpose?\n\n\n\nWaking from a vision that the schizoid built\n\nListening to puddles swallow melted snow\n\nSpring has sprung and finally it’s not cold outside\n\nAnd I’m thinking about the places that I want to go\n\nPassion dissipates when it’s fastened to\n\nThe faces we wear only to become them\n\nLying to ourselves everyday becomes incredibly easy",
