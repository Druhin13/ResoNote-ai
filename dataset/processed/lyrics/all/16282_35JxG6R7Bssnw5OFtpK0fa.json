  "lyrics": "When you're young\r\nMust've left for the town\r\nDarlin', when you part\r\nYou won't slow down\r\nDidn't lay here lay beside me\n\nIn my mother's home\n\nHung like a pendant\n\nMy little heart of stone\n\n\n\nOoh, let me wear you like a beautiful dress\n\nLet me love you\n\nLet me wear you like a beautiful dress\n\n\n\nEyes open\n\nLittle milk on the tongue\n\nBarely smiling\n\nTo see your silence stung\n\n\n\nWhen you're near me\n\nNo love, more goodbyes\n\nThe hard thing about love\n\nIs that it has to burn all the time\n\n\n\nCome back!\n\nLet me wear you like a beautiful dress\n\nLet me love you\n\nLet me wear you like a beautiful dress, yeah!\n\n\n\nLet me wear you like a beautiful dress\n\nLet me love you\n\nLet me wear you like a beautiful dress, yeah!",
