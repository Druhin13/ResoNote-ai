  "lyrics": "I was handed keys to the kingdom\r\nI was given a haunted guitar\r\nAnd I heard it sing\r\nEvery song it ever wrote and them some\r\nI was [?] onto the wings\n\nOf this Lincoln made out of steel\n\nIn Arizona\n\nUnderneath the painted sky and then some\n\n\n\nAnd I drank the water\n\nAnd I saw the master's eyes\n\n\n\nI head Elvis singin' 'bout Jesus\n\nI saw Daddy, Norma Jean too\n\nOh what a view\n\nEveryone I've ever loved and then some\n\n\n\nAnd I drank the water\n\nAnd it was paradise\n\n\n\nI was handed keys to the kingdom\n\nI was given a haunted guitar\n\nAnd it made me sing\n\nEvery song it ever wrote and then some",
