  "lyrics": "Mornin' side of midnight, 'nother state line comin' up\r\nIt's down to the truckers, the troopers, and troubadours like us\r\nI'm out of coffee, Andy's burnin' his last cigarette\r\nAnd the needle's droppin', but the tank ain't empty yet\r\nWe can't stop now, can't stop now\n\nNo we can't stop now, El Dorado\n\n\n\nHotel paper full of songs I write for you\n\nHighway sailor, miles and miles to sing 'em to\n\nThat silver liningâ€™, oh no it ain't hidin' on no map\n\nI gotta find it, I'll pull it down and bring it back\n\n\n\nWe can't stop now, can't stop now\n\nNo we can't stop now, El Dorado\n\nWe can't stop now, can't stop now\n\nNo we can't stop now, El Dorado\n\n\n\nWe can't stop now, can't stop now\n\nNo we can't stop now, El Dorado\n\nWe can't stop now, can't stop now\n\nNo we can't stop now, El Dorado",
