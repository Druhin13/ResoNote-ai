  "lyrics": "Well it's the first day of spring\r\nAnd the leaves tap on my window\r\nYeah I'm allergic to the wind\r\nAnd my head's glued to the pillow\r\nI keep on jamming the door\n\n'Cause I know I can't move anymore\n\n\n\nI said you should wear you head in\n\nBut it's a bus and a train away\n\nIt's not as if I'm spending my time leading you astray\n\n\n\nAnd since I seen the pictures\n\nAnd I don't want no unnecessary mischief\n\n\n\nI try my hardest but I can't see the fun, uh-oh, woah oh\n\nAnd I'm not trying to disappoint anyone, uh-oh, woah oh\n\n\n\nI find it straight to get out I step on down to the front door\n\nI get too tired in a crowd that don't miss what you're asking for\n\n\n\nAnd since I seen the pictures\n\nAnd I don't want no unnecessary mischief\n\n\n\nGive me that something that's already been done, uh-oh, woah oh\n\nI get so tired even thinking of one, uh-oh, woah oh\n\n\n\nI know this love says 'exciting' from the other side\n\nYes there's no point in asking the disappointment\n\n2000 miles\n\n\n\nI try my hardest but I can't see the fun\n\nAnd I'm not trying to disappoint anyone\n\nGive me that something that's already been done\n\nI get so tired even thinking of one",
