  "lyrics": "We made blood boil\r\nTurned many eyes red\r\nThey felt the earth shake the second our lips connected\r\nWe built our own house\r\nIt got rat infested\r\nSet it on fire 'cause everything's replaceable\n\nBut you and our memories\n\nNo one can touch them\n\n\n\nBecause we're barbed wire\n\nTwo strands twisted to one\n\nRazor sharp\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\nYeah, we're barbed wire\n\nTwo strands twisted to one\n\nRazor sharp\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\n\n\nTripped over ourselves\n\nWe slept in the gutter\n\nWe rolled around in broken glass\n\nSelf-inflicted, but we had each other\n\nTo stop the infection from spreading throughout all our veins\n\nWith you, through the hardest moments\n\nNo one can steal them\n\n\n\nBecause we're barbed wire\n\nTwo strands twisted to one\n\nRazor sharp\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\nYeah, we're barbed wire\n\nTwo strands twisted to one\n\nRazor sharp\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\n\n\nGot enough in our lives\n\nGot enough, got enough in our lives to worry about\n\nTo worry about\n\nBeen through enough in our lives\n\nBeen through enough, through enough in our lives\n\nDon't worry about\n\nDon't worry about everyone else\n\nWith you, through the hardest moments\n\nNo one can steal them\n\n\n\nWe're barbed wire\n\nTwo strands twisted to one\n\nRazor sharp\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\nYeah, we're barbed wire\n\nTwo strands twisted to one\n\nRazor sharp\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\nNo one will ever touch us\n\n\n\nGot enough in our lives\n\nGot enough, got enough in our lives to worry about\n\nTo worry about\n\nNo one will ever touch us",
