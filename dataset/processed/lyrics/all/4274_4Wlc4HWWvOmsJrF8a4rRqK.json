  "lyrics": "The whole town lined up outside the tent\r\nWhat those kids thought they saw-\r\nDo you really want to remember this?\r\nToday, think of all the alien shots in the dark\r\nThat at one time, all at once, coexisted\n\nI mean aside from all the burning\n\nHurry by the shanties beside the road\n\n\n\nSunset on a cart\n\nPulled home by a white horse\n\nConscience of the husband was righteous and coarse\n\nThere must be a limit\n\nIf we only circle around\n\nThere's no hurry in reaching it\n\n\n\nShirt bloodstained\n\nAnd yet it was not Abel but Cain who got to hear\n\nThe voice that for so long had been a stranger\n\nNot one word of all the time they spent growing up brothers\n\nEven love, yes, even love, yes, even lose\n\nSomething to lose\n\n\n\nWhat if the details there were suddenly shared?\n\nTender moments siblings keep secret\n\n\n\nSunset on a time when no words could be spared\n\nUnknowing mother rocks soft in her chair\n\nThere must be a limit\n\nThis has happened\n\nThis will happen\n\nThis is happening\n\n\n\nVoice on the radio again\n\nStrange to be shaped by such strange men\n\nIt's the hottest summer again\n\nStrange to be shaped by such strange men\n\nBut where will you go? Where?\n\n\n\nWhere, where?\n\nWhen you asked me that question it sounded like a joke\n\nA rubber hand extended to shake\n\nOutside my kitchen the sound of fists on the door\n\nIn the early morning light\n\nA death so small and sentimental\n\nDaddy giving the middle finger to the Kodak lens\n\nWhen I saw her face she smiled\n\n\"I don't know why I saved it all this time\"",
