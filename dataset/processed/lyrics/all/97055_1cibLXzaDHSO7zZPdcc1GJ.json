  "lyrics": "It was twenty sixteen, Pittsburgh\r\nBack of the bus when I first heard\r\nMa gave me the first word\r\nAmbulance at the house, said she's concerned\r\nShe goes to the door to investigate\r\nSaid it doesn't look good, feel her hesitate\n\nMedics worked and they tried to resuscitate\n\nBy the time they arrived it was too late\n\n\n\nWas your breathing getting shallow?\n\nWas the darkness getting darker?\n\nWhile the demons that you hide from\n\nHeld you underneath the water\n\nI'm at a loss for words but you know it\n\nDid you make it out to mount St. Joseph?\n\nI keep open doors that need closing\n\nIt's done nothing but let the cold in\n\n\n\nYou know I wouldn't mind\n\nCoulda spent a little time\n\nBut I guess you made your mind up\n\nGuess I'll never know the why\n\nOr the pain you had inside\n\nBut it really fucks me up that\n\n\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\n(You never said, you never said)\n\nYou never said goodbye\n\n(You never said, you never said)",
