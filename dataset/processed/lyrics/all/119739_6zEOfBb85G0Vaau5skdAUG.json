  "lyrics": "Leaves are fallin', it's September\r\nThe night came in and made her shiver\r\nI told her she could have my jacket\r\nWrapped it tight around her shoulders\r\nAnd I was so young\r\n'Till she kissed me\n\nLike a whiskey, like a whiskey\n\n\n\nI never knew that love was blind\n\n'Till I was hers but she was never mine\n\nYeah, I was reckless\n\nBut I let it burn\n\nI let it burn, yeah\n\nThe feeling, it was bittersweet\n\nRealizing I was in too deep\n\nShe was a lesson\n\nI had to learn\n\nI had to learn, yeah\n\n\n\nI used to try to forget her\n\nBut now I smile when I remember, ooh\n\n\n\nLeaves are fallin', it's September\n\nThe night came in and made her shiver\n\nI told her she could have my jacket\n\nWrapped it tight around her shoulders\n\nAnd I was so young\n\n'Till she kissed me\n\nLike a whiskey, like a whiskey, oohh\n\nLike a whiskey, oohh\n\n\n\nWould've left this world behind just to wake up by your side\n\nEvery mornin' I would've sold my soul for a little more time\n\nWould've waited a thousand nights if she never said goodbye\n\nI admit that I would've sold my soul for a little more time\n\n\n\nI used to try to forget her\n\nBut now I smile when I remember, ooh\n\n\n\nLeaves are fallin', it's September\n\nThe night came in and made her shiver\n\nI told her she could have my jacket\n\nWrapped it tight around her shoulders\n\nAnd I was so young\n\n'Till she kissed me\n\nLike a whiskey, like a whiskey\n\n\n\nI ain't like the other Cognacs\n\nOlder type of cat that'd never call back\n\nOr lose contact when you runnin' out of rum \n\nAnd you make a run (Feelin' light and dizzy, make me tipsy)\n\nAll that tequila is a killer, \n\nLittle vodka break or something proper\n\nPop a cork and play spin the bottle\n\n(Every time you kiss it, like some whiskey)\n\nConstruct love, it's a fine line\n\nDom PÃ©rignon, she the fine wine\n\nSomeone call 911, I'm runnin' out of time\n\nShe done got off my heart\n\n\n\nLeaves are fallin', it's September\n\nThe night came in and made her shiver\n\nI told her she could have my jacket\n\nWrapped it tight around her shoulders\n\nAnd I was so young (So Young)\n\n'Till she kissed me (Yeah)\n\nLike a whiskey (Yeah)\n\nAnd I was so young (So Young)\n\n'Till she kissed me\n\nLike a whiskey, like a whiskey",
