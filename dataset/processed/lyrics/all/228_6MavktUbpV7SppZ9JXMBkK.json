  "lyrics": "I was trying to play it cool, just a couple with the guys\r\nWhen you broke in with a fire in your eyes\r\nCutting up the floor like you own the place\r\nCigarette and whiskey with a smile on your face\r\n[?] Levis on your knees\n\nOversized sweater from [?]\n\nPushing through the crowd, tryna reach the bar\n\nYou gave me that look and now I...\n\n\n\nGot me high with those eyes\n\nHad to say what was on my mind\n\n\n\nYou've got me gone, how wrong till we're\n\nDancing on a tables, just tryna prove the whole world wrong\n\n[?] through the speakers, screaming every word\n\n'Cause nothing don't mean anything, so just\n\nHold me close and let me lose control, oh\n\nBaby burn the night down\n\nDance until we stumble home, home\n\nBaby burn the night down\n\nDance until we stumble home\n\n\n\nI was going home not thinking of a thing\n\nBoy broke my heart, still recovering\n\nIt was violin in the air, DJ dropping [?]\n\nWhen I saw you smile at me\n\nThe whole room stopped, it was hard to be\n\nEverything I want and finally yeah\n\n\n\nGot me high with those eyes\n\nHad to say what was on my mind\n\n\n\nYou've got me gone, I was wrong till we're\n\nDancing on the tables, tryna prove the whole world wrong\n\n[?] through the speakers, screaming every word\n\n'Cause nothing don't mean anything, so just\n\nHold me close and let me lose control, oh\n\nBaby burn the night down\n\nDance until we stumble home, home\n\nBaby burn the night down\n\nDance until we stumble home\n\n\n\nYou've got me gone, how long till we're\n\nDancing on the tables, tryna prove the whole world wrong\n\n[?] through the speakers, screaming every word\n\n'Cause nothing don't mean anything, so just\n\nHold me close and let me lose control, oh\n\nBaby burn the night down\n\nDance until we stumble home, home\n\nBaby burn the night down\n\nDance until we stumble home",
