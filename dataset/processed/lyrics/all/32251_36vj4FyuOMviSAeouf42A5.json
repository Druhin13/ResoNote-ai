  "lyrics": "I suck all the life out of everything I see\r\nI drink a bottle of wine\r\nI've got the digital content blues\r\nI got money saved up somewhere\r\nLost the card and the chequebook, name of the bank\r\nThere's a plague in my head\n\nCome here, get away from me\n\n\n\nI believe in God\n\nBut I don't believe we're getting out of this one\n\nBefore somebody pays for the things I've done\n\nI did some terrible things it's true\n\nBut even terrible-r were the things I didn't do\n\nWhen I was living up at Kalamazoo\n\nGet away from me\n\n\n\nAll my life\n\nAll my life I'm jumping rock to rock\n\nI'll see you in your dreams\n\nAll my life\n\nAll my life I've built this fortress\n\nOn the edge of your town\n\nCome here and get away from me\n\n\n\nHave you ever stayed up all night\n\nIn a trailer park in a field in Germany\n\nWhile a man on a motorcycle circles around real slow?\n\nAnd you shiver and it's cold and the sun comes up\n\nAnd your friends wake up and you tell them about the man\n\nWas he ever even there? And you don't even know\n\n\n\nSo you say you want to get to know me\n\nSo you say you want to make contact\n\nWell, talk to me baby come here get away from me\n\nTalk to me baby come here get away from me\n\nTalk to me baby get to know me, you can take it right back\n\n\n\nI got one doctor that I talk to every week about this panic\n\nI got one doctor that I talk to every week about this apathy\n\nI can't wake up and I don't know how to sleep\n\nHoney, I got a paradox and I can't get free\n\nCome here, put your hand on my knee\n\nAnd don't touch me, get away from me\n\n\n\nAll my life\n\nAll my life I'm jumping rock to rock\n\nI'll see you in your dreams\n\nAll my life\n\nAll my life I've built this fortress\n\nOn the edge of your town\n\nCome here and get away from me",
