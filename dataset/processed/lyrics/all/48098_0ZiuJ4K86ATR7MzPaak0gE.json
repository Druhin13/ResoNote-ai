  "lyrics": "No more carefree laughter\nSilence ever after\nWalking through an empty house\nTears in my eyes\nHere is where the story ends\nThis is goodbye\n\n\n\nKnowing me, knowing you (a-ha)\n\nThere is nothing we can do\n\nKnowing me, knowing you (a-ha)\n\nWe just have to face it\n\nThis time we're through \n\nBreaking up is never easy, I know\n\nBut I have to go \n\nKnowing me, knowing you\n\nIt's the best I can do\n\n\n\nMemories, good days, bad days \n\nThey'll be with me always \n\nIn these old familiar rooms\n\nChildren would play\n\nNow there's only emptiness\n\nNothing to say\n\n\n\nKnowing me, knowing you (a-ha)\n\nThere is nothing we can do\n\nKnowing me, knowing you (a-ha)\n\nWe just have to face it\n\nThis time we're through \n\nBreaking up is never easy, I know\n\nBut I have to go \n\nKnowing me, knowing you\n\nIt's the best I can do",
