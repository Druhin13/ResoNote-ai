  "lyrics": "Full moon shinin' bright\r\nEdge of the water we were feelin' alright\r\nBack down a country road\r\nThe girls are always hot & the beer is ice cold\r\nCadillac horns on the hood\r\nMy brother Jarrod had his dad hook us up good\n\nGirls smiled when we rode by\n\nThey'd hop in the back & we'd cruise to the riverside\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nWohh never gonna grow up\n\nWohh never gonna slow down\n\nWohh we were shinin' like lighters in the dark\n\nIn the middle of a rock show\n\nWohh we were doin' it right\n\nWohh we were comin' alive\n\nWohh We were caught up in a southern summer\n\nBarefoot bluejean night\n\n\n\nBlue eyes & auburn hair\n\nSittn' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair\n\nNew to town, new to me\n\nHer ruby red lips were sippin' on sweet tea\n\nShot me a look like a shootin' star\n\nSo I grabbed a beer & my ole guitar\n\nSat around til the break of dawn\n\nHowlin' & singin' to our favorite songs\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus x2",
