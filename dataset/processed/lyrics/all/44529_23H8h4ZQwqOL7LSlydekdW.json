  "lyrics": "A dreaded curse - Is spoken of\r\nBy all men of the sea - An ancient tale\r\nOf pirate's woe - And sailor's tragedy\r\nA map was drawn - By grizzled men\r\nForgotten years ago - A chest of glory\n\nAnd mortal sin - The none should ever know\n\n\n\nAnd they searched and they searched\n\nAnd they searched and they searched\n\nFor forbidden treasure old\n\nAnd this curse, and this curse,\n\nand this curse, and this curse\n\nWill forever now be told\n\n\n\nA pirate captain - Of many years\n\nHad heard these whispers grim - But lust for treasure\n\nAnd endless wealth - Had all but blinded him\n\n\n\nHe hired a crew - Of hardy men\n\nTo help him in his cause - They never knew\n\nThe danger of - This bounty's evil force\n\n\n\nAnd they searched and they searched\n\nAnd they searched and they searched\n\nFor forbidden treasure old\n\nAnd this curse, and this curse,\n\nand this curse, and this curse\n\nWill forever now be told\n\n\n\nNow stormy nights - When moon is full\n\nWill herald in their call - A ghostly crew\n\nWho loot and kill - 'til all before them fall\n\nNow listen, lad - Remember this\n\nWhen foul winds blow agale - Lest shadow come\n\nAnd write your name - In adage to this tale",
