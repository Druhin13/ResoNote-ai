  "lyrics": "Sick of this ceiling and tired of the bedroom floor\r\nSwimming in the hallways, looking for an open door\r\nI've tried to sleep, I’ve sung these songs before\r\nThey come back to me in different colours\r\nThese shadows and numbers are staring me down\n\nYeah, I hate the feeling they're hanging around\n\n\n\nAh, maybe this time, maybe this time we'll be fine\n\nWe could make shapes out of old ways\n\nWatch them fight the sky\n\nThe mind is a cage no bird is used to\n\nWhen we fly, whatever we make is never a waste of time\n\n\n\nBreathing my demons\n\nFunny how they all blow smoke\n\nTalking to the good ones\n\nAnd laughing at the songs we wrote\n\nI’ve had this dream, a little less intense when I'm sleeping (When I'm sleeping)\n\nAnd my tongue keeps speaking different colors\n\n\n\nThese shadows and numbers keep staring me down\n\nOoh, you know I hate it when they do that\n\n\n\nAh, maybe this time, maybe this time we'll be fine\n\nWe could make shapes out of old ways\n\nWatch them fight the sky\n\nThe mind is a cage no bird is used to\n\nWhen we fly, whatever we make is never a waste of time\n\n\n\nAh, maybe this time, maybe this time we'll be fine (We'll be fine)\n\nWe could make shapes out of old ways\n\nWatch them fight the sky\n\nThe mind is a cage no bird is used to\n\nWhen we fly (We fly), whatever we make is never a waste of time\n\n\n\nNever a waste, never a waste of time\n\nNever a waste, never a waste of time",
