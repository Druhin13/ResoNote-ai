  "lyrics": "When it all began, was it time that we asked for?\r\nOr was it anything to feel complete forevermore?\r\nWanna see myself like I used to back then\r\nBut every time I turn around I’m in LA again\r\nDon’t take this for granted, that’s not how we planned it\r\nI know, we’re tearing these pages\n\nBefore we get to watch it unfold\n\n\n\nYeah, it’s a long road\n\nYou think your time is running out\n\nGotta be looking up when it goes down\n\n\n\nKnow that I’ve seen better days\n\nTurned and looked the other way\n\nBut with you I can’t see past the crystal ball\n\n(To all we ever wanted)\n\nI can’t fight this disconnection\n\nYou can see my imperfection\n\nStill, at least I’ll never be ungrateful\n\n\n\nOpposite of here there’s a bold faced enemy\n\nBut sure enough, when I look up\n\nIt’s myself staring back at me\n\nI’m not saying there’s a reason\n\nClose it up and leave it, even though\n\nWe’d still be tearing the pages\n\nBefore the rest of it changes\n\nSo let’s go\n\n\n\n‘Cause it’s a long road\n\nYou think your time is wearing thin\n\nRemember to breathe out when you dive in\n\n\n\nKnow that I’ve seen better days\n\nTurned and looked the other way\n\nBut with you I can’t see past the crystal ball\n\n(To all we ever wanted)\n\nI can’t fight this disconnection\n\nYou can see my imperfection\n\nStill, at least I’ll never be ungrateful\n\n\n\nI think my nights are my days\n\nI can feel you slipping away\n\nSo savor every moment\n\nDon’t you stay in disarray\n\nI think my nights are my days\n\nI can feel you slipping away\n\nCan we savor every moment\n\nFind ourselves along the way\n\nI confess\n\n\n\nThat it’s a long road\n\nYou think your time is running out\n\nGotta be looking up when it goes down\n\n\n\nKnow that I’ve seen better days\n\nTurned and looked the other way\n\nBut with you I can’t see past the crystal ball\n\n(To all we ever wanted)\n\nI can’t fight this disconnection\n\nYou can see my imperfection\n\nStill, at least I’ll never be ungrateful",
