  "lyrics": "He was a poor boy, raised in a small family \nHe kinda had a craving for somethin' no one else could see \nThey say that he was crazy, \nThe kind that no lady should meet \nHe ran out to the city and wandered around in the street \nHe wants to dance, oh yeah, \n\nHe wants to sing, oh yeah, \n\nHe wants to see the lights a flashin' and listen \n\nto the thunder ring \n\n\n\nHe saw it in a window \n\nThe mark of a new kind of man \n\nHe kinda liked the feeling, so shiny and smooth in his hand \n\nHe took it to the country and practiced for days without rest \n\nAnd then one day he felt if, \n\nHe knew he could stand with the best \n\n\n\nThey got respect, oh yeah, \n\nHe wants the same, oh yeah, \n\nAnd it's a certain kind of fool who \n\nLike to hear the sound of his own name \n\nOo... \n\n\n\nA poster on a storefront, the picture of a wanted man \n\nHe had a reputation spreading like fire throughout the land \n\nIt wasn't for the money, at least it didn't star t that way \n\nIt wasn't for the runnin' , but now he's runnin' everyday.",
