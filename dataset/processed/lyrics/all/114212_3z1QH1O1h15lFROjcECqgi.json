  "lyrics": "Six beers, five guys\r\nAnd if I remember right\r\nIt was a Wednesday when we got our buzz off\r\nA second-hand six pack\r\nHalf smoked, soft pack\r\nLight it up, boys take a drag\n\nAnd when I fought that cough off everyone else thought\n\nI was so damn cool\n\n\n\nMy head was spinning like a tilt-a-whirl\n\nYeah man it really rocked my world\n\n\n\nBack when everything seemed just a little bit stronger\n\nBack when the weekend lasted a little longer\n\nI can't tell you how they did but things seemed to never end back then\n\nOh, way back when\n\nWhen a little went a long way\n\n\n\nOne girl, and 45\n\nBucks was all it took that night\n\nHit the steak house, make-out in the movies\n\nWay up in the back\n\nCredits roll, on pace\n\nTo make it all the way to second base\n\nTried to play it cool like it was nothing new\n\nAnd she didn't have clue\n\n\n\nMy head was spinning like a tilt-a-whirl\n\nYeah man she really rocked my world\n\n\n\nBack when everything seemed just a little bit stronger\n\nBack when the weekend lasted a little longer\n\nI can't tell you how they did but things seemed to never end back then\n\nOh, way back when\n\nWhen a little went a long, long way\n\n\n\nBack when everything seemed just a little bit stronger\n\nBack when the weekend lasted a little longer\n\nI can't tell you how they did but things seemed to never end back then\n\nOh way back when, when a little went a long way\n\nA long, long way, a long way",
