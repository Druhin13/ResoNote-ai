  "lyrics": "When the calls and conversations\r\nAccidents and accusations\r\nMessages and misperceptions\r\nParalyze my mind\r\nBusses, cars, and airplanes leaving\n\nBurning fumes of gasoline\n\nAnd everyone is running\n\nAnd I come to find a refuge in the\n\n\n\nEasy silence that you make for me\n\nIt's okay when there's nothing more to say to me\n\nAnd the peaceful quiet you create for me\n\nAnd the way you keep the world at bay for me\n\nThe way you keep the world at bay\n\n\n\nMonkeys on the barricades\n\nAre warning us to back away\n\nThey form commissions trying to find\n\nThe next one they can crucify\n\n\n\nAnd anger plays on every station\n\nAnswers only make more questions\n\nI need something to believe in\n\nBreathe in sanctuary in the\n\n\n\nEasy silence that you make for me\n\nIt's okay when there's nothing more to say to me\n\nAnd the peaceful quiet you create for me\n\nAnd the way you keep the world at bay for me\n\nThe way you keep the world at bay\n\n\n\nChildren lose their youth too soon\n\nWatching war made us immune\n\nAnd I've got all the world to lose\n\nBut I just want to hold on to the\n\n\n\nEasy silence that you make for me\n\nIt's okay when there's nothing more to say to me\n\nAnd the peaceful quiet you create for me\n\nAnd the way you keep the world at bay for me\n\n\n\nThe easy silence that you make for me\n\nIt's okay when there's nothing more to say to me\n\nAnd the peaceful quiet you create for me\n\nAnd the way you keep the world at bay for me\n\nThe way you keep the world at bay for me\n\nThe way you keep the world at bay",
