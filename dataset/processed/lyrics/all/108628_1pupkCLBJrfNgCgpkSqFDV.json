  "lyrics": "Make me your Scarlett whore just make me your fiend \nI'll be your bastard son I'll be your unclean \nI won't deny I'm everything that you hate \nThe lie is what's remembered anyway \nI see things in a new light \n\nAnd just when it feels right \n\nI will tear down all you've built \n\n\n\nSee things in a new light \n\nAnd just when it feels right \n\nI won't cry for the blood I spill \n\n\n\nWon't disappoint I'm every demon you seek \n\nAnd yes my silver tongue will prey on the weak \n\nSo hide your children tell them not of my sins \n\nThe ugly truth is I'm what you might have been \n\n\n\nI see things in a new light \n\nAnd just when it feels right \n\nI will tear down all you've built \n\n\n\nSee things in a new light \n\nAnd just when it feels right \n\nI won't cry for the blood I spill I\n\n\n\n'm what hides in the dark \n\nI'm what grips at your heart",
