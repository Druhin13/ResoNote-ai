  "lyrics": "Waking up to a new sunrise\r\nLooking back from the other side\r\nI can see now with open eyes\r\nDarkest water and deepest pain\r\nI wouldn't trade it for anything\r\nCause my brokenness brought me to You\n\nAnd these wounds are a story You'll use\n\n\n\nSo I'm thankful for the scars\n\n'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart\n\nAnd I know they'll always tell of who You are\n\nSo forever I am thankful for the scars\n\n\n\nNow I'm standing in confidence\n\nWith the strength of Your faithfulness\n\nAnd I'm not who I was before\n\nNo, I don't have to fear anymore\n\n\n\nSo I'm thankful for the scars\n\n'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart\n\nAnd I know they'll always tell of who You are\n\nSo forever I am thankful for the scars\n\n\n\nI can see, I can see\n\nHow You delivered me\n\nIn Your hands, In Your feet\n\nI found my victory\n\nI can see, I can see\n\nHow You delivered me\n\nIn Your hands, In Your feet\n\nI found my victory\n\n\n\nI'm thankful for Your scars\n\n'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart\n\nAnd with my life I'll tell of who You are\n\nSo forever I am thankful\n\n\n\nI'm thankful for the scars\n\n'Cause without them I wouldn't know Your heart\n\nAnd I know they'll always tell of who You are\n\nSo forever I am thankful for the scars\n\nSo forever I am thankful for the scars",
