Is she ready?)\n\nSwervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai\n\nPlease don't run up on it unless you ready to die\n\n\n\nPoverty stricken, hot wings was kickin'\n\nGrew up with God and grew up with nadda\n\nAin't that a bitch? So I married her too\n\nSpiritual folks don't eat good\n\nClearin' my throat as I bless the food\n\nAlmighty God, how the fuck you help these killers boss up?\n\nMake they bread while our neighborhood filmin' Walkin' Dead\n\nBow our heads shit, we split a P between all us\n\nWe was in them church buildings, they was robbin' us silly\n\nCame home, only thing they left us was the ceilings\n\nQuick reminder, the finer things in life are the hideous inside\n\nMy nigga that's a lie, that's a mind fuck\n\nThat's a brain rape\n\nSellin' waters for a dolla', hope my niggas don't see us\n\nSpeak about it at the school, watch how quick I bust a lip\n\nRed light, catch me outside 28's and up\n\nI just wanna be that nigga that they look up to for once\n\n\n\nI went out and bought the best car my money could buy\n\nAsked yo baby mama if she ready to ride\n\nSwervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai\n\nPlease don't run up on it unless you ready to die\n\n\n\nI'm in a dope boy game, oh, in a dope boy lane, oh\n\nRockin' dope boy frames, oh, boy your dope don't change\n\nIn a dope game, oh, in a dope boy lane, oh\n\nRockin' dope boy frames, oh, boy your dope don't change\n\n\n\nI only got five in the tank\n\nTwo slow leaks on the right side\n\nKey scratches on the paint, stick shift on the fritz\n\nI'm like fuck this whip, can't bag no hoes like this\n\nI'm on my go, go gadget, movin' through jungle traffic\n\nI was a hoodrat magnet, I had to drop old habits\n\nMy cousin went to war at nineteen\n\nHe started a family whippin' that truck\n\nHe got attacked, we just glad he made it back\n\nFirst thing that nigga did scooped that E-Class Benz\n\nTurn a humble family function to another event\n\nAnd we been neck and neck since we was kids, you know what that meant\n\nAfter we signed to the 'ville, right to the auction I went\n\nSo what would you rather get nigga? A car or a crib?\n\nGot released from them leases, never again payin' rent\n\nWe all suffer through struggle, you never know the extent\n\nCatch me on Old Nat' and Godby, never forget where I been\n\n\n\nI went out and bought the best car my money could buy\n\nAsked yo baby mama if she ready to ride\n\nSwervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai\n\nPlease don't run up on it unless you ready to die\n\nI went out and bought the best car my money could buy\n\nAsked yo baby mama if she ready to ride\n\nSwervin' through the hood on the way to Dubai\n\nPlease don't run up on it unless you ready to die",
