  "lyrics": "It was a Sunday when I met you\r\nI can still smell your cologne\r\nFrom that first hug, it was too much\r\nBut I couldn't let you go\r\nFour months later, still my favourite\r\nBut when you know, you know\n\nYou are the best thing\n\nI like you the most\n\n\n\nBut sometimes I wanna kill you\n\nFor reasons I don't know why\n\nBut I'd be the first to save you\n\nSo it's alright\n\n\n\n'Cause when it comes down\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nI'll be around, holding us down through it\n\nI know I got some things to work on\n\nAnd you've got your issues too\n\nBut when it comes down to it\n\nI'm not done with falling in love with you\n\n\n\nIt was a Wednesday in your bedroom\n\nYou said you were in love\n\nFor the first time, in my green eyes\n\nWere ready for the flood\n\nAll the late nights, all the bad fights\n\nBut when you know, you know\n\nYou are the best thing\n\nI like you the most\n\n\n\n'Cause when it comes down\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nI'll be around, holding us down through it\n\nI know I got some things to work on\n\nAnd you've got your issues too\n\nBut when it comes down to it\n\nI'm not done with falling in love with you\n\n\n\nI'm not done with falling\n\nI'm not done with falling for you\n\nOh oh, and maybe we got problems\n\nBut I know we can solve 'em\n\nNo I'm not done with falling\n\nNo, not done\n\n\n\n'Cause when it comes down\n\nWhen it comes down to it\n\nI'll be around, holding us down through it\n\nI know I got some things to work on\n\nAnd you've got your issues too\n\nBut when it comes down to it\n\nI'm not done with falling in love with you\n\n\n\nNot done, not done\n\nI'm not done with falling in love with you\n\nNot done, not done\n\nI'm not done with falling in love with you",
