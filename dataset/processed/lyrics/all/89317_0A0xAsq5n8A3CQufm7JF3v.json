  "lyrics": "Well, this water colored sunset's gonna fade right into dark\r\nAnd this tailgate's gonna rust and this old truck will run out of starts\r\nWether I go first or you do, girl, one day we won't be together\r\nWhen you look at me, I just don't believe some things can't last forever\r\nI'll quit loving you when country roads don't wind and curve\n\nWhen cold beer don't quench your thirst\n\nWhen there ain't an \"Amen\" in church\n\nBaby, I'll quit loving you\n\nWhen the sun sets to the east\n\nWhen the sky turns evergreen\n\nBaby, don't you ever think\n\nThat I'll quit loving you, yeah\n\n\n\nWell, I know it might sound crazy thinking this thing out that far\n\nWell, that's just how it sounds when a good ol' boy speaks from the heart\n\nYeah, every night you're first in line each time I count my blessings\n\nI'll never quit believing, girl, that you were sent from heaven\n\n\n\nBut I'll quit loving you when country roads don't wind and curve\n\nWhen cold beer don't quench your thirst\n\nWhen there ain't an \"Amen\" in church\n\nAnd baby, I'll quit loving you\n\nWhen the sun sets to the east\n\nWhen the sky turns evergreen\n\nBaby, don't you ever think\n\nThat I'll quit loving you, yeah\n\nThat I'll quit loving you\n\n\n\nYeah, I'll quit loving you when the Mississippi river runs dry\n\nWhen Colorado Rockies ain't high\n\nWhen the Tennessee moon don't shine\n\n\n\nAnd baby, I'll quit loving you\n\nWhen the sun sets to the east\n\nWhen the sky turns evergreen\n\nBaby, don't you ever think\n\nThat I'll quit loving you, I'll quit loving you\n\nYeah, that I'll quit loving you, yeah. yeah\n\nYeah, I'll quit loving you",
