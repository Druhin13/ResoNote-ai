  "lyrics": "There sat a new test\r\nMuch harder that you bought in\r\nAs for the unseen\r\nJust take care of what you will\r\nLight the silent alarm\r\nWe never think that\n\nWe're missing much\n\nTill\n\n\n\nI gasp and hold my breath\n\nThese needs had changed so deep\n\nTo face you all I say\n\nI've been awake for...\n\n\n\nI need a new test\n\nThen I sat out to choose\n\nSomeone to\n\nLight the soul like a kiln\n\nJust imagine us chasing this with\n\nEyes scorned from sleep apnea\n\nA slight of tongue as the seas\n\nAre emptying\n\n\n\nI gasp and hold my breath\n\nThese needs had changed so deep\n\nTo face you all I say\n\nI've been awake for... Ever... Ever... Ever... Ever...\n\n\n\nTry to read off a letter that's\n\nFalling apart\n\nThe sun and the moon\n\nI count sheep\n\nEscape like an animal I'm ready for\n\nMy sleepless stroll\n\n\n\nI've felt these shifting hours\n\nMistakenly used up\n\n\n\nI gasp and hold my breath\n\nThese needs had changed so deep\n\nTo face you all I say\n\nI've been awake for years\n\n\n\nI gasp and hold my breath\n\nThese needs had changed so deep\n\nTo face you all I say\n\nI've been awake for... Ever... Ever... Ever... Ever",
