  "lyrics": "It's getting hard for me to reframe all those shifting memories\r\nLike a music box that never starts dancing by itself\r\nWhat a broken world, what a broken world\r\nIt is my only wish to see you, to see through you\r\nI step inside\n\nLetting go\n\nI want to be happier now\n\nI want to be more than closed\n\nSurreal, the way you made me out\n\nThe way you crashed me down\n\n\n\nIt's getting hard for me to remember all of the names from my life\n\nYou've been so many different kinds of people in my mind\n\n\n\nLetting go\n\nI want to be happier now\n\nI want to be more than closed\n\nSurreal, the way you made me out\n\nLetting go\n\nI want to be happier now\n\nI want to be more than closed\n\nSurreal, the way you made me out\n\nThe way you crashed me down\n\n\n\n\n\nLetting go\n\nI want to be happier now\n\nI want to be more than closed\n\nSurreal, the way you made me out\n\nLetting go\n\nI want to be happier now\n\nI want to be more than closed\n\nSurreal, the way you made me out\n\nThe way you crashed me down",
