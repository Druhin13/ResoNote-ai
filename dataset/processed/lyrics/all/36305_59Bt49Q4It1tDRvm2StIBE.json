  "lyrics": "She was looking for what they speak about, \nBecoming such a believer now, the more that she be around, \nThe more that she see a reason to see it out, \nThinking like \"how could I be without?”, \nAnd without question, without guessing to figure out the connection \nAnd being in it and leaving her dealings out by the exit, \n\nAnd knowing the baddest bitches is eating off her reflection, \n\nCrown holder, remember to lean when you accept it, \n\nLet it, be the company, \n\nThat attracts the same when you be in need of company, \n\nTil you believe in company, \n\nShe said \"it weigh more than you think, so keeping company \n\nCan seem overrated if you don't own your patience”, \n\nSaid it go for the taking as far as taking it goes, \n\nAnd you'll be forever mistaken if your stake in it grows, \n\nType of shit that keep you nervous, \n\nLike how this just thesurface?, and how no one deserved it?, \n\nShit that give you purpose \n\n\n\nAnd the purpose of it, as far as she know, \n\nIs finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, \n\nBut knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, \n\nWay up out the way from where she able to see tho \n\n\n\nWord to my love\n\nWord to my time\n\nWord to my heart\n\nIf your love is divine \n\nCan you give me something more than I can see through?, \n\n'Cause I just wanna trust and believe you, \n\nAnd the purpose of it \n\n\n\nAnd the purpose of it, as far as she know, \n\nIs finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, \n\nBut knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, \n\nWay up out the way from where she able to see tho \n\n\n\nShe was at a point where she might be out, \n\nBut figured out what she might've found, \n\nTalking finder's keepers, when you find it you keep it and bring the light around, \n\nEspecially how they lifting the prices now, \n\nShe shows that off by all means, \n\nAlong with the heels that's walking thru y'all dreams, \n\nShe moves like \"pardon me\", I'm moving like \"par please, \n\nI just came here for her”, \n\nYou feel like you did the same but couldn't stay for the worth, \n\nSo you broke before you broke thru, \n\nI was in line for the dope like I'm a local, \n\nAnd I taught her what hope do, \n\nSaid she heard about it but it only made her hopeful, \n\nAnd I ain't getting high alone so I sling her the dope too, \n\nTo see her prophecy, her ebony tone is locking me, \n\nThe way she moan when she be taking the whole 9 from me, \n\nFucking up a bottle of privilege while we debating, \n\nI point out what a privilege it is to see her sacreds \n\n\n\nAnd the purpose of it, as far as she know, \n\nIs finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, \n\nBut knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, \n\nWay up out the way from where she able to see tho \n\n\n\nWord to my love\n\nWord to my time\n\nWord to my heart\n\nIf your love is divine \n\nCan you give me something more than I can see through?, \n\n'Cause I just wanna trust and believe you, \n\nAnd the purpose of it \n\n\n\nAnd the purpose of it, as far as she know, \n\nIs finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, \n\nBut knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, \n\nWay up out the way from where she able to see tho \n\n\n\nWhere she's able to see tho, was all she thought was left for her to see, \n\nTold her I would be remiss if I ain't catch her up to me, \n\nMade a part, play the part, getting dressed for her beliefs, \n\nTold me those was Botticelli's when I swept her off her feet, \n\nKnew the issue, but seen between the hands, \n\nCool on triple, Kima Keisha Pam, \n\nI pull up in the new shit, see how we can work this, \n\nI bring up her tomororws, she bringing up the purpose, \n\nAnd feeling like the purpose of it \n\n\n\nAnd the purpose of us being here, \n\nIs us agreeing on how everything we see in here \n\nIs nothing that we ever saw before, so to be in here, \n\nIs us assuming we won’t ever have to leave from here, \n\nYou said all you wanted was a purpose or a reason where, \n\nYou would never have to doubt what you believe in here, \n\nAnd I’m looking at you like whoever used to be in here, \n\nMade it tough for us to breathe in here, \n\nBecause the purpose of it, as far as she know, \n\nIs finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, \n\nBut knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, \n\nWay up out the way from where she able to see tho",
