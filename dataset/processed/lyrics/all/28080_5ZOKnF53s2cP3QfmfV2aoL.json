  "lyrics": "I’ve fallen down darkness is the victor\r\nDemons crowd around dancing as they whisper\r\nWords of impending doom\r\nEverything is fine, yo it’s all in your mind…chill\r\nIt’s in my head but I can’t take this lightly\r\nThese thoughts are mine and that makes them frightening\n\nI may be leaving soon\n\nThey gather around you as you drown\n\nNow it’s time to put on your face\n\nBehind this cloak is just a ghost\n\nJealous of every single breath you take\n\n\n\nYou’re standing strong, but it seems the ground is shaking\n\nYou’re not alone, we’re standing with you till the end\n\nOhhhh ohhhhh\n\nI know your heart is aching\n\nOhhhh ohhhhh\n\nWe’re standing with you till the end\n\n\n\nHow can a sound of joy be so haunting?\n\nThey drag me down laughing as they taunt me\n\nWith words of impending doom\n\nI got your back, just try to relax…chill\n\nThe end is near a distant oasis\n\nNo longer complacent I can escape this\n\nI may be leaving soon\n\n\n\nYou’re standing strong, but it seems the ground is shaking\n\nYou’re not alone, we’re standing with you till the end\n\nOhhhh ohhhhh\n\nI know your heart is aching\n\nOhhhh ohhhhh\n\nWe’re standing with you till the end\n\n\n\nSee it all starts with bliss as it plants a kiss right upon your temple\n\nThen your problems pile on top of you impossible to block these issues\n\nTemperatures rising off the charts, feeling like a stranger in my skin\n\nAnd I’m so sorry that I was hateful\n\nPain loses and anger wins\n\nI try to be thoughtless but regardless the darkness is closing in\n\nWhen I fall apart will you find it in your heart to pick me up again\n\nA shattered me or scattered debris of the lucid human I used to be\n\nBut they can’t know the demons I carry\n\nI’m bearing a chilled disease\n\nI hear\n\nVoices emanating so familiar and happy\n\nThe chatter of Family and friends laughing\n\nThey gather around you as you drown\n\nNow it’s time to put on your face\n\nBehind this cloak is just a ghost\n\nJealous of every single breath you take\n\n\n\nYou’re standing strong, but it seems the ground is shaking\n\nYou’re not alone, we’re standing with you till the end\n\nOhhhh ohhhhh\n\nI know your heart is aching\n\nOhhhh ohhhhh\n\nWe’re standing with you till the end",
