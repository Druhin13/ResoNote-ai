  "lyrics": "You don't have to bring me flowers\r\nWon't you just let me be\r\n'Cause every time you try to womb me, it wounds me\r\nDon't leave no flowers here for me\r\nIt looks like the moonlight has left\n\nI don't see much magic ahead\n\nTrying to say you're sorry with whiskey on your breath\n\nIs like trying to clear the smoke with cigarettes\n\n\n\nYou don't have to bring me flowers\n\nI'll just leave 'em here for dead\n\n'Cause when this thing goes sour\n\nAre we living all the hours you'll spend losing me instead\n\n\n\nI think a little sunlight will do\n\nTo help me clear my head of you\n\n'Cause trying to say it's over while I'm laying in your bed\n\nIs like letting go with honey on my hand\n\n\n\nYou don't have to bring me flowers\n\nI'm just begging you to leave\n\nGo ahead and call me coward\n\nBut finally your power has lost its hold on me\n\n\n\nOh-oh-ooh\n\nI'm letting go\n\nOh-oh-ooh\n\nI'm letting go\n\nOh-oh-ooh\n\nI'm letting go\n\nWon't you let me go\n\n\n\nIf you're gonna bring me flowers\n\nLeave them on a memory\n\nAt last the love we had together\n\nAnd it's better if we let it rest in peace\n\n\n\nWon't you let it rest in peace\n\nDon't leave no flowers here for me\n\nDon't leave no flowers here for me",
