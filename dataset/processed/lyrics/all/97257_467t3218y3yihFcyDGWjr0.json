  "lyrics": "You're dressing like a Sunday morning\r\nAnd your eyes look like, little islands in the light\r\nHazel and light green\r\nOn white sheets\r\nYou're grinning like a Friday night\n\nAnd you're smiling like, you know what you like\n\nI think I do know you well\n\nI know you well\n\n\n\nWe come alive in the evening\n\nWith heat and wet skin\n\nAnd our bodies are tossed and turned\n\nTangled up in it\n\n\n\nI come alive when you tease me\n\nWith heat and wet skin\n\nFlesh and bone turned\n\nFlesh and bone turned\n\nThe weight of you close to me\n\n\n\nYou hold me like a prized possession\n\nThat's close\n\nOur bodies, unfurl like smoke\n\nWe twist and we curl like smoke\n\n\n\nFever out\n\nWe're burning now\n\nHoller out\n\nWe holler out 'til hollowed out\n\n\n\nWe come alive in the evening\n\nWith heat and wet skin\n\nAnd our bodies are tossed and turned\n\nTangled up in it\n\n\n\nI come alive when you tease me\n\nWith heat and wet skin\n\nFlesh and bone turned\n\nFlesh and bone turned\n\nThe weight of you in the evening\n\nYour wet skin\n\nOur bodies are tossed and turned\n\nTangled up in it\n\nI come alive when you tease me\n\nWith heat and wet skin\n\n\n\nYour body's close\n\nAnd your body's close\n\nThe weight of you",
