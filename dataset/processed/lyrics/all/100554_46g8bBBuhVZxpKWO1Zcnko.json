  "lyrics": "These visions in your vapor make you more and less\r\nKeeping chaos is a chore today\r\nBut that murder in your sorrow bellows smoke and death\r\nI wonder what the neighbors... will think of to say?\r\nThunderstorms, banging on my windows\n\nChloroform, sticking to my face and then\n\nCareful now, a symbol is a promise\n\nGoing down, going down in flames\n\n\n\nBefore the crash\n\nWe get you home\n\nIt's nothing serious\n\nIt's just the space between the sword and stone\n\n\n\nOnly the ones left over\n\nWill ever get it right\n\nWe all know (know)\n\nWe know the riddle but the answer is mine\n\nCause only the ones left over\n\nWill ever get it right\n\nWe all know (know)\n\nWe know the future is another Friday knight\n\n\n\nExquisite in absentia and divine inside\n\nCan your differences come out to play?\n\nWhen did all the heroes take the goddamn blame?\n\nWhen did all the villains... catch all the breaks?\n\n\n\nThunderstorms, banging on my windows\n\nChloroform, sticking to my face and then\n\nCareful now, a symbol is a promise\n\nGoing down, going down in flames again\n\n\n\nOnly the ones left over\n\nWill ever get it right\n\nWe all know (know)\n\nWe know the riddle but the answer is mine\n\nCause only the ones left over\n\nWill ever get it right\n\nWe all know (know)\n\nWe know the future is another Friday knight\n\n\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nSoft quotation never sounds as real\n\nConfrontation always makes you feel\n\n\n\nBefore the crash\n\nWe get you home\n\nIt's nothing serious\n\nIt's just the space between the sword and stone\n\n\n\nOnly the ones left over\n\nWill ever get it right\n\nWe all know (know)\n\nWe know the riddle but the answer is mine\n\nCause only the ones left over\n\nWill ever get it right\n\nWe all know (know)\n\nWe know the future is another Friday knight",
