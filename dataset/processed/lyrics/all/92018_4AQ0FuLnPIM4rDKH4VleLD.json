  "lyrics": "I wake up and get me a\r\nGas station biscuit\r\nHead to town, wash it down with some Mountain Dew\r\nI end every day about the same way\r\nClock out and go fish just to crack a few\r\nChicken in a bread pan\n\nPickin' out gulls and cull with some ten pound tail\n\nIt might be hillbilly to a lot of folks\n\nBut Lord knows I couldn't care less\n\n\n\nYou can say I'm a redneck\n\nYou can say you don't like my truck\n\nYou can say that I talk and I dress all funny\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country\n\nYou can say I drink too many longnecks\n\nAnd my edges are a little too rough\n\nYou can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country\n\n\n\nA pond water pool, a spinner on a spool\n\nA styrofoam full of tobacco spit\n\nI got a small town crew, we make our own rules\n\nI do what I do 'cause my daddy did\n\n\n\nYou can say I'm a redneck\n\nYou can say you don't like my truck\n\nYou can say that I talk and I dress all funny\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country\n\nYou can say I drink too many longnecks\n\nAnd my edges are a little too rough\n\nYou can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country\n\n\n\nYou can say that the world's flat\n\nYou can say we never made it to the moon\n\nYou can say we all come from a bunch of monkeys\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country, no\n\n\n\nYou can say I'm a redneck\n\nYou can say you don't like my truck\n\nYou can say that I talk and I dress all funny\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country\n\nYou can say I drink too many longnecks\n\nAnd my edges are a little too rough\n\nYou can call me a sinner 'cause I cuss on Sunday\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't country\n\nYou can say what I'm smokin' on is kinda funky\n\nBut you, you can't say I ain't\n\nYou can't say I ain't country (No you can't)\n\nOh no, you can't say I ain't country\n\nThat's right",
