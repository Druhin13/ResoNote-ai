  "lyrics": "Do you see the world in different colors?\r\nDo you see the world in black and gray?\r\nAlone in your thoughts, how many others\r\nHave stood where you stand, where you stand today\r\nI've stood where you stand, but oh can you...\n\nWait for me now?\n\nTake off this crown\n\nTo break all these vows\n\nDon't you know?\n\nWait for me now\n\nAir's running out\n\nWait for me, wait for me\n\nWait for me, wait for me now\n\n\n\nThe promise of safe return I delivered\n\nBut the ocean is wider than I first guessed\n\nWhen roads disappeared I followed the rivers\n\nBut somehow got in over my head\n\nSo a deep breath I'm taking\n\n\n\nWait for me now?\n\nTake off this crown\n\nTo break all these vows\n\nDon't you know?\n\nWait for me now\n\nAir's running out\n\nWait for me, wait for me\n\nWait for me, wait for me now\n\n\n\nA lost dream of what could have been\n\nA house on fire, a tangled web\n\nThe key turns to find the locks have changed\n\nIn time to hear the back door slam\n\nA sound that to this day I can't forget\n\nThe colors drained to black and gray\n\nOh...\n\n\n\nWait for me now?\n\nTake off this crown\n\nTo break all these vows\n\nDon't you know?\n\nWait for me now\n\nAir's running out\n\nWait for me, wait for me\n\nWait for me, wait for me now",
