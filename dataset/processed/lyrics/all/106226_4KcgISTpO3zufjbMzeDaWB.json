  "lyrics": "It's 5 in the morning\r\nCan you at least tell me where you're going\r\nOr if I'm even really here with you\r\nBut maybe this is on me\r\nJust want to show you how our future could be\n\nIsn't that what you've always wanted\n\nDarling?\n\nDarling...\n\n\n\nSo I tried my hardest to show you something\n\nI thought that no one else could\n\nBut in the end we die alone\n\nSo maybe this is good\n\nAnd from the bottom of my fucking heart\n\nI wish you understood\n\nThat I was made for you babe\n\nI was made for you babe\n\nI was made for you babe\n\nI was made for you\n\n\n\nNow it's 12 o'clock noon\n\nNot even a text, I hope you come home soon\n\nI can't get out of bed\n\nJust tell me what was said\n\nPlease just come home, I can't be alone again\n\nIf I could touch your skin\n\nJust one more time\n\nI swear that I will make this right\n\nThat I will make this right\n\nThat I will make this right",
