  "lyrics": "Uh, yo\r\nGreetings and salutations, I'm runnin' outta patience\r\nSo everything in moderation, even moderation\r\nCheck every single allegation for re-calibration\r\nCall that the big pay back, it's debt consolidation\n\nThe credit fell, what the hell, too much b√©chamel\n\nWell, F-M-L, they desecrated the decibel\n\nGo check the mail then let me know if it's heads or tails\n\nMy ears burn like desert trails and Jezebels\n\nUh, somebody must be talkin' 'bout me\n\nFor carryin' a big stick and walkin' loudly\n\nArticles in the Times and the New Yorker 'bout me\n\nMy killer instinct is like Orchid, probably\n\nI'm a Pulitzer Prize Fighter how I vaporize writers\n\nShut 'em down at one time, synchronize silence\n\nMake the audience forget you, call it Alzheimer's\n\nChild rhymers don't come at the old timers\n\nWhether your fan base is lil' mommas or Obamas\n\nHow you claim to have somethin' in check with no commas?\n\nYou and Mary got the same request, it's No Drama\n\nI'm the pinnacle of language, yes, the Dalai Lama\n\nWho the clown talkin' down to the twenty-one pound?\n\nI gotta send him some rounds to simmer him down\n\n'Cause you're not worthy to even touch the hem of the gown\n\nThe brim of the crown, motherfucker, remember the sound\n\nIt's like\n\n\n\nHey, yo\n\nYo\n\n\n\nSince the second grade I been gainfully employed\n\nHustlin' for change everyday from three to four\n\nWhen other kids was into playin' games and bein' bored\n\nGoin' against the grain's what I painfully enjoyed\n\nWhen they was into race cars, trains, TV and toys\n\nI was thinkin' fat gold chains and freakazoids\n\nFillin' the deeper void, listenin' to that Indecent Noise\n\nPeople used to tell me, \"Boy, your brain gon' be destroyed\"\n\nLeft hand to the law, right hand to Allah\n\nBoth hands to applaud who brought sand to the shore\n\nConfessin' all your sins to the dope man through a door\n\nI seen a preacher man sniffin' cocaine through a straw\n\nWe almost had it all, just one more cannon ball\n\nAnd two more Geritol with one more Adderall\n\nI got the game sewn like the tailor of Panama\n\nNow I go by the name of an untamed animal\n\nWonderin' how I can evolve to prestigious and less vicious\n\nA more visceral individual, best wishes\n\nJust on principle, I been answerin' death wishes\n\nWhat the Lord giveth is a king, long liveth",
