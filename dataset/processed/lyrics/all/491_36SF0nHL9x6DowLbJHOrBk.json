  "lyrics": "You're smoke and guns\r\nYou think I'm sick of it?\r\nI wouldn't have it any other way\r\nYou're too much fun\r\nThink I can't handle it?\r\nLeft with no words and yet so much to say\n\n\n\nNow in my darkest hour and not my brightest day\n\nI'm always calling you and telling you \"I should not say\"\n\nI'm melting in your hands, go on, make your demands\n\nYou've got me slipping through your fingers like I'm made of sand\n\n\n\nWhen we hit the lights, you're fading out of sight\n\nI feel your heartbeat, wrap yourself around me\n\nIs it all for show? Because I'm good to go\n\nSo go ahead, I'll take it all\n\n\n\nYou're smoke and guns\n\nYou think I'm sick of it?\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\nYou're too much fun\n\nThink I can't handle it?\n\nLeft with no words and yet so much to say\n\nYou wanted from me, some honesty\n\nSo honestly, I wanna feel you breathe\n\nYou're smoke and guns\n\nYou think I'm sick of it?\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\n\n\nNow, as your lipstick smears\n\nBy light of chandelier\n\nI taste the tension and I'm begging\n\nDon't you disappear\n\n\n\nNot in my rightest mind\n\nYou tell me \"That's just fine\"\n\nOh what an evening, now you're leaving\n\nWith my hands still tied\n\n\n\nWhen we hit the lights, you're fading out of sight\n\nI feel your heartbeat, wrap yourself around me\n\nIs it all for show? Because I'm good to go\n\nSo go ahead, I'll take it all\n\n\n\nYou're smoke and guns\n\nYou think I'm sick of it?\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\nYou're too much fun\n\nThink I can't handle it?\n\nLeft with no words and yet so much to say\n\nYou're wanted from me, some honesty\n\nSo honestly, I wanna feel you breathe\n\nYou're smoke and guns\n\nYou think I'm sick of it?\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\n\n\n(I wouldn't have it any other way)\n\n\n\nBetween your fingertips and running down your lips\n\nYou got me up against a wall\n\nIs it all for show? Because I'm good to go\n\nSo go ahead, I'll take it all\n\n\n\nYou're smoke and guns\n\nYou think I'm sick of it?\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\nYou're too much fun\n\nThink I can't handle it?\n\nLeft with no words and yet so much to say\n\nYou're wanted from me, some honesty\n\nSo honestly, I wanna feel you breathe\n\nYou're smoke and guns\n\nYou think I'm sick of it?\n\nI wouldn't have it any other way\n\n\n\nYou're smoke and guns",
