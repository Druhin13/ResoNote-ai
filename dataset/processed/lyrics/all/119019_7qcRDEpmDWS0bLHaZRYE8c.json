  "lyrics": "To the bag packed, first love leaver\r\nThe heart cracked, double down dreamer\r\nThe homesick for grass that's greener\r\nAnd a slice of Mama's peach pie\r\nTo the flat broke, couch cushion gas money\n\nThe worker bee that ain't gettin' no honey\n\nMissin' someone all the while runnin'\n\nGunnin' for the brighter lights\n\n\n\nHere's to the break ups that didn't break us\n\nThe break down, wrong turn that takes ya\n\nTo a little dive bar in Dahlonega\n\nHear a song from a band that saves ya, man\n\nIt's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em\n\nNothing's going right\n\nMakin' the best of the worst day kinda night\n\n\n\nWe've all got a number that we don't wanna drunk dial\n\nAnd a good friend we ain't seen in a while\n\nAnd a slow dance left in these boots\n\nAnd a chance at putting down new roots\n\n\n\nHere's to the break ups that didn't break us\n\nThe break down, wrong turn that takes ya\n\nTo a little dive bar in Dahlonega\n\nHear a song from a band that saves ya, man\n\nIt's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em\n\nNothing's going right\n\nMakin' the best of the worst day kinda night\n\n\n\nHere's to the break ups that didn't break us\n\nThe break down, wrong turn that takes ya\n\nTo a little dive bar in Dahlonega\n\nMeet a girl outside Atlanta, man\n\nIt's hittin' rock bottom smoke 'em if you got 'em\n\nNothing's going right\n\nYou're just singing along with your drink riased\n\nA pretty little blonde thing's looking your way\n\nMakin' the best of the worst day kinda night\n\nYeah, it's making the best of the worst day kind of night\n\n\n\nOh\n\nHere's to the breakups\n\nIt's that kinda night",
