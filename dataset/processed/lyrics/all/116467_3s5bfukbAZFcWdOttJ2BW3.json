  "lyrics": "Walked a crooked road for a crooked mile\r\nShowed my crooked teeth and my crooked smile\r\nI read a cuckoo clock on a crooked wall\r\nTurns out it's all crooked, y'all\r\nAnd I don't know what I'm supposed to do\n\nTurns out that I'm crooked too\n\n\n\nI read a crooked headline on a crooked page\n\nThere's a crooked leader on a crooked stage\n\nBut he seems to think he's standin' tall\n\nTurns out it's all crooked, y'all\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm supposed to do\n\nTurns out that I'm crooked too\n\n\n\nSo when you stand before that setting sun\n\nAnd the needle's broken and the record's spun\n\nYou'll hear a stampede from a cattle call\n\nTurns out it's all crooked, y'all\n\nOh, it turns out it's all crooked, y'all",
