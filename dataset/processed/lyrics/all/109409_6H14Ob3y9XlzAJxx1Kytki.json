  "lyrics": "People always ask why I wear black\r\nWhere'd I get my style and why I never smile in pictures\r\nThey ask me what I drink, I'll sip on anything\r\nBut I'm a little more California smoke than liquor\n\nNo, it ain't that I'm self-conscious, I'm just conscious of myself\n\n\n\nI'll side with the outsiders\n\nThose long-shot last-round fighters\n\nAnyone who ain't afraid to stray off course\n\nMy heart bleeds for country music\n\nWhere the honest outlaw truth is\n\nNo, I ain't no white knight\n\nI'm a little more\n\nDark horse\n\n\n\nNo, I don't go to church, can't quote a bible verse\n\nI couldn't sing a song but that don't mean that I don't talk to Jesus\n\nGirls say I push them off, that I can't open up\n\nBut I ain't afraid of love, when I say it I just want to mean it\n\n\n\nYeah, I side with the outsiders\n\nThose long-shot last-round fighters\n\nAnyone who ain't afraid to stray off course\n\nMy heart bleeds for country music\n\nWhere the honest outlaw truth is\n\nNo, I ain't no white knight\n\nI'm a little more\n\nDark horse\n\n\n\nNo, it ain't that I'm self-conscious, I'm just conscious of myself\n\nAnd I don't know how to be nobody else\n\n\n\nSo I side with the outsiders\n\nThose long-shot last-round fighters\n\nAnyone who ain't afraid to stray off course\n\nMy heart bleeds for country music\n\nWhere my honest outlaw truth is\n\nNo, I ain't no white knight\n\nI'm a little more\n\nDark horse",
