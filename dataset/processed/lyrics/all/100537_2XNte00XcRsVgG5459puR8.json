  "lyrics": "The way I see it\r\nMoney ain't evil\r\nGod ain't just in a box with the steeple\r\nNothing wrong with city but I love country people\r\nFriday nights, I'd rather hear Hank than the Beatles\n\nThe way I see it\n\nYou sow your wild oats\n\nHowl up at the moon\n\nTell a few jokes\n\nTill you get lucky\n\nFind yourself a keeper\n\nTake her home to mama\n\nPut a ring on her finger\n\n\n\nDon't get any better from where I'm sitting\n\nSunset swingin' with a front porch view\n\nRight about now, ain't a thing I'm missin'\n\nSix string in my hands, right next to you\n\nIf we're talking 'bout heaven, this night already been\n\nBaby, you and me forever, that's the way I see it\n\nYou and me forever, that's the way I see it\n\n\n\nThe way I see it town's too crowded\n\nTruck ain't broke in till a hundred-thousand\n\n'Yee-haw' and 'amen' were meant to be shouted\n\nRound here every single blessing gets counted\n\n\n\nDon't get any better from where I'm sitting\n\nSunset swingin' with a front porch view\n\nRight about now, ain't a thing I'm missin'\n\nSix string in my hands, right next to you\n\nIf we're talking 'bout heaven, this night already been\n\nBaby, you and me forever, that's the way I see it\n\nYou and me forever, that's the way I see it\n\n\n\nThe way I see it it's a real good life\n\nLooking at you, looking through my eyes\n\n\n\nDon't get any better from where I'm sitting\n\nSunset swingin' with a front porch view\n\nRight about now, ain't a thing I'm missin'\n\nSix string in my hands, right next to you\n\nIf we're talking 'bout heaven, this night already been\n\nBaby, you and me forever, that's the way I see it\n\nYou and me forever, that's the way I see it",
