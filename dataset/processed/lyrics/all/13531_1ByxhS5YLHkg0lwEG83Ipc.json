  "lyrics": "Another hand on your heart, with borrowed time\r\nYour skin was cold, your soul was ice\r\nYou only want what you tangle, inside your bones\r\nYour head will blow, like a cannonball\r\nHow can you break if you got no bones\n\nHow can you wag if you got no dog\n\n\n\nBut all you want you just feel, no world outside\n\nStay with my bones, stay til you like\n\nWe're only plastic toys, break down to size\n\nStay with my bones, stay til you like\n\n\n\nHow can you break if you got no bones\n\nHow can you wag if you got no dog\n\nI don't wanna waste my life\n\nTil the tables turn\n\n\n\nGonna skin it all down, to the ground\n\nYou're gonna skin it all down, to the ground\n\nYou're gonna skin it all down, to the ground\n\nYou're gonna skin it all down, to the ground",
