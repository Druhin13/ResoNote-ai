  "lyrics": "Nothing to take back or exchange \nDouble engine dawn express train \nAlways dreamin', it's the search not the find \nLouder than sounds on stream machine \nOr some internal combustion burning clean \nAlways schemin', it's the search not the find \n\nDoor is open, to change your mind \n\n\n\nWe're chasin' paint cans, 21st century \n\nAll mixed up in modern company \n\nAlways dreamin', it's the search not the find \n\nWipe the sound, wipe the video \n\nSome terracota info wherever you go \n\nAlways dreamin', it's the search not the find \n\nDoor is open, to change your mind \n\n\n\nThey can listen in and they can nose around \n\nThey can listen in but they can never take us down \n\n\n\nSo leave it to the last believer now \n\nChange in the air it came by turnstile \n\nAlways schemin' it's the search not the find \n\nDoor is open, to change your mind \n\n\n\nThey can listen in and they can nose around \n\nThey can listen in but they can never take us down",
