  "lyrics": "I'm coming to the edge of the widest canyon\r\nMy companions' dear\r\nI'm starting to question my manifest destiny\r\nMy claim to this frontier\r\nI'm coming to the brink of a great disaster\n\nThe end just has to be near\n\nThe Earth spins faster, whistles right past you\n\nWhispers death in your ear\n\nDon't pretend you can't hear\n\nDon't pretend you can't\n\n\n\nI can hear your tendrils still digging\n\nFor everything that's walked this Earth once living\n\nThen to be exhumed and burned to vapor\n\nCan you save her?\n\nNow she's in the air\n\nRadical and free\n\nNeither here nor there\n\nShe's obliged to no one\n\nShe's obliged to no one\n\nYeah, yeah\n\n\n\nI'm coming to the edge of a rising ocean\n\nSuch commotion and fear\n\nKeeping all our eyes on what's on the horizon\n\nAnd all that we hold dear\n\n\n\nI'm coming to the brink of a great disaster\n\nEnd just has to be near\n\nThe Earth spins faster, whistles right past you\n\nWhispers death in your ear\n\nDon't pretend you can't hear\n\nDon't pretend you can't\n\n\n\nI can hear your tendrils still digging\n\nFor everything that's walked this Earth once living\n\nThen to be exhumed and burned to vapor\n\nCan you save her?\n\nShe's in the air\n\nRadical and free\n\nNot a goddamn care\n\nShe's obliged to no one\n\nShe's obliged to no one\n\nOh, no\n\n\n\nDon't pretend you can't hear\n\nDon't pretend you can't hear",
