  "lyrics": "Just to see the sun breaking\r\nJust to find a place to stand\r\nJust to not be overtaken\r\nWhen I hold you in my hands\r\nIt's all I want\n\nI keep trying to remember that\n\nIt's all I want\n\nI keep trying to remember that\n\n\n\nJust to watch you in the window light\n\nJust to do a better job\n\nJust to leave a little when I go at night\n\nJust to get along with God\n\n\n\nI can't tell if you're finally coming back to me\n\nOr if you're finally leaving\n\nSometimes you gotta keep a little bit to yourself\n\nA little something to keep believing in\n\n\n\nIt's all I want\n\nI keep trying to remember that\n\nIt's all I want\n\nI keep trying to remember that\n\nI keep trying to remember that\n\n\n\nI know I dance around the things I should come clean to\n\nI don't mean to\n\nNobody should ever have to go round anywhere at all with their head down\n\nI wouldn't dream to\n\nSaid it was true but it's hard to believe\n\nFeels like we're losing now more than we're winning\n\nI'm up through the night because God never sleeps and I'm trying\n\nTrying to reach you to tell you that I am still faithful\n\nWe'll be alright\n\n\n\nJust to meet you in the morning light\n\nJust to find an easy place\n\nJust to be a little less hard on everything\n\nJust to see you face to face",
