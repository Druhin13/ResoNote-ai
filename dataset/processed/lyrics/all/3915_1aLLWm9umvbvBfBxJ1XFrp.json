  "lyrics": "Gonna stomp our boots till the neighbors call the cops\r\nGonna put that boom back into the old boombox\r\nTurn the dial way up to ten, then we'll turn it up again\r\nAnd wake up every house on the whole damn block\r\nIt's the calm before the storm\n\nDon't say I didn't warn ya\n\nThis ain't no Sunday morning coming down\n\n\n\nIt's gonna get loud like a 12 gauge\n\nLike a shockwave shaking the ground\n\nLoud like a freight train\n\nLike the roar of a hometown crowd\n\nGet loud like the speedway\n\nGonna blow these speakers on out\n\nIt's the only way we know how\n\nNo we ain't turning down\n\n\n\nGonna get loud\n\nEverybody get loud\n\n\n\nHow's that sound to you, sounds good to me\n\nWhen the sun drops down so low [?] easy (Yeah)\n\nNow don't knock it till you try it\n\nGonna start a riot in this peace and quiet\n\nLittle town\n\n\n\nIt's gonna get loud like a 12 gauge\n\nLike a shockwave shaking the ground\n\nLoud like a freight train\n\nLike the roar of a hometown crowd\n\nGet loud like the speedway\n\nGonna blow these speakers on out\n\nIt's the only way we know how\n\nNo we ain't turning down\n\n\n\nGonna get loud\n\nEverybody get loud\n\nOh, get loud\n\n\n\nLoud\n\nGet loud\n\nEverybody get loud\n\nWe're gonna get loud\n\n\n\nIt's gonna get loud like a 12 gauge\n\nLike a shockwave shaking the ground\n\nLoud like a freight train\n\nLike the roar of a hometown crowd\n\nGet loud like the speedway\n\nGonna blow these speakers on out\n\nIt's the only way we know how\n\nNo we ain't turning down\n\n\n\nGonna get loud\n\nEverybody get loud\n\nOh, everybody get loud\n\nCome on, get loud\n\nIt's gonna get loud",
