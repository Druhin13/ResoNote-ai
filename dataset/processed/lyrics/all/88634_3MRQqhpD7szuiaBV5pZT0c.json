  "lyrics": "Summer's gone, but you can be my winter lovin\r\nSummer's gone, but you can be mine\r\nThe world stops spinning when you open your eyes my darlin\r\nWhat a beautiful soul, you deserve your own island\r\nSo Trust me\n\nI'll give you that\n\nHeartbeat\n\nMoving fast\n\nThe only way I know is the only\n\nWay you're heading\n\nCome near me\n\nDon't fear me\n\nThat's why I'm running, running just looking for ya\n\nAll I wanted\n\nWas a morning\n\nWith you honey\n\nYou see I'm drowning\n\nTryna make your love surround me\n\nHoping you never look down on me\n\nJust waiting for the summer to end\n\n\n\nSummer's gone, but you can be my winter lovin\n\nSummer's gone, but you can be mine\n\nThe world stops spinning when you open your eyes my darlin\n\nWhat a beautiful soul, you deserve your own island\n\n\n\nWon't you love me? I'll be\n\nThe only one, gods speed\n\nHoly grail and I know if our time was up tomorrow\n\nI'd pull you near me, now that's real heat\n\nAnd spin you like a bottle baby spin you like serato\n\nLet me walk you through the golden age, diamond days, purple haze\n\nAnd show you as the summer fades the difference between night and day\n\nAnd don't you worry bout time and a place\n\nIt's a matter of finding the present and livin and guessin the crescent has risen for Oliver Twist in a matter of days\n\n\n\nSummer's gone, but you can be my winter lovin\n\nSummer's gone, but you can be the angel that fell from the sky when I saw you at first\n\nAnd it wasn't a dream, and I knew it was you that I saw when I saw what I saw and I conquer my fears\n\nAnd I'm running for joy\n\nAnd you begging for mercy and I'm begging for more\n\n\n\nSummer's gone, but you can be my winter lovin\n\nSummer's gone, but you can be mine\n\nThe world stops spinning when you open your eyes my darlin\n\nWhat a beautiful soul, you deserve your own island\n\n\n\nEverything you want over everything you need (4x)",
