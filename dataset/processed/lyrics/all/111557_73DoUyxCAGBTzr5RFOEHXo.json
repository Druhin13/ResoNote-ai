  "lyrics": "There's two ways it goes now\r\nAs our love comes crashing down\r\nYou could be the flame that burns out\r\nOr you could turn and burn it down\r\nAnd in my life I've found the sweetest killers hanging around\r\nWaiting on your undeserving lips to smile on a life you know exists\n\n\n\nSo if you worry, don't worry 'bout me\n\nI always wanted you to see\n\nThe California coast-line on your own time\n\nAnd if you worry, don't worry 'bout me\n\nI always wanted to be free\n\nIn the simple way\n\nI found in all those younger days\n\n\n\nIf I don't wake up trace me on the asphalt\n\nLet the morning rain wash me away\n\nThere's two ways it goes now\n\nAs our love comes crashing down\n\nYou could be the flame the burns out\n\nOr you could turn and burn it down\n\nAnd look at what you have now\n\nThe silver dagger in your mouth\n\nWaiting on the words to come down\n\nThat this ain't working out\n\n\n\nIf you worry, don't worry 'bout me\n\nI always wanted you to see\n\nThe California coast-line on your own time\n\nAnd if you worry, don't worry 'bout me\n\nI always wanted to be free\n\nIn the simple way\n\nI found in all those younger days\n\n\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\n(Am I blue, enough? Am I blue, enough?)\n\n\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\nIf you worry, don't worry about me\n\n(Am I blue, enough? Am I blue, enough?)",
