  "lyrics": "Lie beneath. Faded and selfish I fall between\r\nJaded and helpless, I long to breathe wasted and empty inside\r\nTo feel faceless and buried alone\r\nInto your eyes I live, beautifully broken\r\nFight! We'll fight!\n\nAnd bury our lies\n\nWe'll break these chains\n\nAnd wash it away\n\nOh light, carry me over the ground\n\nHeavy won't hold me down\n\n\n\nBlind belief wasted in envy\n\nI long to bleed. Nameless and hated\n\nI fall relieved, violent and empty\n\nAlive to see. Suffer in silence alone\n\nInto your eyes I live\n\nBeautifully broken\n\n\n\nFight! We'll fight!\n\nAnd bury our lies\n\nWe'll break these chains\n\nAnd wash it away\n\nOh light, carry me over the ground\n\nHeavy won't hold me down\n\n\n\nLove won't lie\n\nTell me it's over. So long\n\nIâ€™ve done wrong\n\nUnder the shadow of dawn\n\n\n\nFight! We'll fight!\n\nAnd bury our lies\n\nWe'll break these chains\n\nAnd wash it away\n\nCarry me over the ground\n\nHeavy won't hold me down\n\nInto the sun we burn\n\nHeavy won't hold me down!\n\nDown!\n\nDown!\n\nDown!",
