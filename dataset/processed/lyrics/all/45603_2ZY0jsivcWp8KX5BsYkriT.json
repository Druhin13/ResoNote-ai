  "lyrics": "Last night was a fight\r\nCouldn't get things of my mind\r\nThough it felt like I was in the ring\r\nSlept by candle light\r\nScared of running out of time\r\nI wanna do all those little things\n\n\n\nI wanna pack up\n\nSet myself a sail\n\nNew life, never gonna fail\n\nNo matter what stands in my way\n\nI wanna find love\n\nMake a great escape, get lost\n\nGet away from everyone who tells me it's too late\n\n\n\n(Cause whoa)\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nThere ain't no stopping me now\n\n(Whoa)\n\nI'll do whatever it takes\n\nYou'll never keep it down\n\n(Whoa)\n\nMake another mistake\n\nIt's only about, it's all out\n\nSo get ready to dance\n\n(And live a little)\n\n\n\nMom, Dad don't be sad\n\nOne day we'll look back and laugh\n\nCrying all the memories we've missed\n\nTime's like sinking sand\n\nCatch it with the other hand\n\nKeep it for the moments just like this\n\n\n\nI wanna pack up\n\nSet myself a sail\n\nNew life, never gonna fail\n\nNo matter what stands in my way\n\nI wanna find love\n\nMake a great escape, get lost\n\nGet away from everyone who tells me it's too late\n\n\n\n(Cause whoa)\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nThere ain't no stopping me now\n\n(Whoa)\n\nI'll do whatever it takes\n\nYou'll never keep it down\n\n(Whoa)\n\nMake another mistake\n\nIt's only about, it's all out\n\nSo get ready to dance\n\n(And live a little)\n\n\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\nOh oh, yeah!\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\nOh oh, yeah!\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\n(And live a little)\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\nOh oh, yeah!\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\n(And live a little)\n\n\n\nWhen friends come and go\n\nThis family is stone\n\nYou'll always be with me no matter where I go\n\nWherever we are\n\nJust look to the stars\n\nAnd know that you're forever shining in my heart\n\n\n\n(Cause whoa)\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nThere ain't no stopping me now\n\n(Whoa)\n\nI'll do whatever it takes\n\nYou'll never keep it down\n\n(Whoa)\n\nMake another mistake\n\nIt's only about, it's all out\n\nSo get ready to dance\n\n(And live a little)\n\n\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\nOh oh, yeah!\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\nOh oh, yeah!\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\n(And live a little)\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\nOh oh, yeah!\n\n(Whoa oh)\n\n(And live a little)",
