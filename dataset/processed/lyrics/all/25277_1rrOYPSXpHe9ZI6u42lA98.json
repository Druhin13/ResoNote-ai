  "lyrics": "Set me free\r\nI'm a prisoner\r\nChained to you through the distance\r\nWhat's the use in resistance\r\nLet me fade, like a secret\n\nDon't let history repeat this\n\nGive me strength in my weakness\n\n\n\nCause I wanna go back, back to the start again\n\nDo you wanna go back, back to the start again\n\n\n\nJust let me dance in the shadows of your love baby\n\nDance in the shadows of your love baby\n\n\n\nI can hide in the nighttime\n\nGot so tired of the sunrise\n\nDrink it in till it's alright, again\n\n\n\nSaturate my whole wide world for you\n\nDrink the color stoney red or blue\n\nClose the doors and the windows of my mind\n\nLet me have this fantasy inside\n\n\n\nDance in the shadows of your love baby\n\nDance in the shadows of your love baby\n\nDance in the shadows of your love baby\n\n\n\nI burnin' up\n\nI'm feeling best\n\nI'm holding on onto the past\n\nI burnin' up\n\nI'm feeling best\n\nI'm holding on onto the past\n\nI burnin' up\n\nI'm feeling best\n\nI'm holding on onto the past\n\n\n\nDo you wanna go back\n\nBack to the start again\n\nBack to the start again\n\nBack to the start again",
