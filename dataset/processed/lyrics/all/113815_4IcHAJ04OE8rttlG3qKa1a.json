The Porsche 911 got a second engine\n\nSend your boy into the Seventh Dimension, shit\n\nHell is cheap, baby, Heaven’s expensive though\n\nYours truly, ‘bout to get this paper like Judge Judy\n\nTold my baby, “Come do me”, all these drugs just run through me\n\nNow I’m shredding the guitar on a mountain\n\nGod damn, something groovy\n\nAw, man, we lost ‘em to the lights again\n\nBitch, don’t worry, I’ll be back like lightning\n\nJust don’t blink ‘cause you might miss me\n\nI’m about to make history, raise your motherfucking fist for me\n\nAnd let your middle finger fly up and grab your nut sack\n\nAnd scream, “Fuck that”, you hear me?",
