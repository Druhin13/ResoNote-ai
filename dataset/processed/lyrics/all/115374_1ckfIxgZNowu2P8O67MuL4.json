  "lyrics": "I’m sorry if I speak about me too much\r\nI’m sorry that your illness is a sub-sequential reason you don’t eat too much, oh\r\nIt’s obvious we drink too much\r\nI’m sorry that your father never loved you\r\nAnd you saw your mother on the TV too much, oh\n\nYou should pop a bottle again\n\nMaybe buy a couple bars\n\nTake 'em all with your friends, yeah\n\nAnd I don’t even wanna pretend\n\nShould've listened when they told me it's a means to an end, yeah\n\nAnd now I'm all on the fence\n\nI was only nineteen with a lack of respect\n\nAnd then she threw up again\n\nSaid she didn't, but you know I'm reading through it again\n\n\n\nDon’t choose\n\nIf you love it then you cut the thing loose, yeah\n\nDark room\n\nIndecisive so you know I can’t move, yeah\n\nYou too, you too now\n\nIt’s hard for me to end a conversation\n\nWith “I love you” when I know it’s not true, no\n\n\n\nTerrified by thoughts of getting close to you\n\nJustify my terror when we talk it through\n\nFind somebody else to cure the pain for now\n\nPop another pill and help your brain calm down\n\n\n\nThen she fell down the stairs, yeah\n\nSo take it to the basics\n\nNo love, she was hopin’ I could change it\n\nNever been the one to pick favorites\n\nFavoritism isn’t something I relate with well\n\nSo way to make a statement\n\nI was only tryna start a conversation\n\nShe was under the assumption I was famous\n\nKnew she had a heart\n\nDidn’t know that I would break it off\n\n\n\nDon’t choose\n\nIf you love it then you cut the thing loose, yeah\n\nDark room\n\nIndecisive so you know I can’t move, yeah\n\nYou too, you too now\n\nIt’s hard for me to end a conversation\n\nWith “I love you” when I know it’s not true, no\n\n\n\n(You too, you know it's you too\n\nIt's always you too, now)\n\n(It’s hard for me to end the conversation\n\nWith \"I love you\" when I know it’s not true, it's not true, babe\n\nYou too, you too)",
