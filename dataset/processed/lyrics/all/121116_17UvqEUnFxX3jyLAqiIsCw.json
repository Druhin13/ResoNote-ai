  "lyrics": "Rich bored kids, pissing away fortunes\r\nThey'll be on their skids\r\nMothers will be tortured\r\nAnd their dads on pills full of disappointment\r\n'Cause they got no skills\r\nCan't fix shit\n\nBut it'll be okay\n\nWhen all the money's gone away\n\nAnd they'll be free\n\nWhen they're reckless just like me\n\nWhen they're reckless just like you\n\nYou've be stuck inside a dream\n\nThe one where you lose all your teeth\n\nAnd you're in school without your clothes on (clothes on)\n\nBut you'll be okay\n\nEveryone I know has go their debt to pay\n\nSell your soul to make it\n\nThats the modern way\n\nAre you reckless just like me?\n\nAre you ready?\n\n\n\nOblivion, is coming on\n\nOblivion, is coming on\n\n\n\nNothing's real\n\nI really mean it\n\nThat's the way I feel\n\nYou see right through it\n\nCause you're just like me\n\nThe greatest magic trick you've ever seen\n\nCome on and disappear\n\n\n\nOblivion\n\nAnd the uncertainty will come along\n\nOblivion\n\nAnd the uncertainty will come along\n\nOblivion\n\nAnd the uncertainty will come along\n\nOblivion\n\nAnd the uncertainty will come along\n\nYou can get there with me",
