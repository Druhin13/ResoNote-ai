  "lyrics": "I live in a city people wanna move into\r\nI do all the things that people say they wanna do\r\nBut when the songs that we write don't shake the college student loans\r\nEverybody in town wants to move back home\r\nDark in the city\r\nDark, dark in the city\r\nYeah but there's a light on the inside\r\nLight on the inside\r\nDark in the city\r\nDark, dark in the city\r\nThere's a little light on the inside\r\nLight on the inside\r\nâ™ª\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nAll the shops on my street only sell expensive things\r\nWe have everything that nobody really needs\r\nBut if you go a little further, a little further down the road\r\nThe families live on food stamps, and the kids wear worn out clothes\r\nDark in the city\r\nDark, dark in the city\r\nYeah but there's a light on the inside\r\nLight on the inside\r\nDark in the city\r\nDark, dark in the city\r\nThere's a little light on the inside\r\nLight on the inside\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nEverybody knows her from the corner down the street\r\nBecause she asks for money from everybody that she meets\r\nBut no one knows the demons putting words inside her mouth\r\nShe used to be a streetlamp, now her light is going out\r\nDark in the city\r\nDark, dark in the city\r\nYeah, but there's a light on the inside\r\nLight on the inside\r\nDark in the city\r\nDark, dark in the city\r\nThere's a light, oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh\r\nOhhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh",
