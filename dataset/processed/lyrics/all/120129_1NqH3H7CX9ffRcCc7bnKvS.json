  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Torn par Neck deep\r\nI thought I saw a girl brought to life\nShe was warm, she came around like she was dignified\nShe showed me what it was to cry\nWell, you couldn't be that girl I adored\nDon't seem to know, don't seem tocare what your heart is for\nBut I don't know her anymore\n\nThere's nothing where she used to lie\nMy conversation has run dry\nThat's what's going on\nNothing's fine, I'm torn\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\n\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\n\nSo I guess the fortune teller's right\nI should have seen just what was there\nAnd not some holy light\nBut you crawled beneath my veins and now\n\nI don't care, I had no luck\nI don't miss it all that much\nThere's just so many things\nThat I can touch, I'm torn\n\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\nTorn\n\nThere's nothing where she used to lie\nMy inspiration has run dry\nThat's what's going on\nNothing's right, I'm torn\n\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\n\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I'm ashamed\nBound and broken on the floor\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\n\n(Torn, torn, torn, torn)",
