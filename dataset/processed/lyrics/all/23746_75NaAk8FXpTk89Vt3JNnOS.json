  "lyrics": "I wore out my welcome as the days grew thin\r\nIn this Belfast town\r\nIt's like I've been waitin' 'til my life begins\r\nAnd love comes around\r\nI wander through the streets and I see them look away\n\nThe wind hits my bones as they whisper your name\n\nI go out walking in the cold Irish rain\n\n\n\nFed up with the landlord comin' down my door\n\nWith his poison gaze\n\nI've stared out his window and I've walked the floor\n\nOf this sorry place\n\n\n\nI'll take comfort in the cold until I find my faith again\n\nOh God know I've tried but I just can't fit in\n\nI go out walking in the cold Irish rain\n\n\n\nWhat I'd give to see the sun on your face\n\nTo lose myself, in a long embrace\n\nHow I'd love to hear the band start to play\n\nAs you turn me around, Oh I long for the day\n\n\n\nThe last of the ramblin' boys has lost his way\n\nIn these broken times\n\nThey sold off your story and they stole your rage\n\nWith this heart of mine\n\n\n\nThey pulled you from your sleep and they covered up your name\n\nNow on Sundays they pray to see you again\n\nI go out walking in the cold Irish rain\n\n\n\nI go out walking in the cold Irish rain\n\nI go out walking in the cold Irish rain...\n\n\n\nIn the rain, in the rain.",
