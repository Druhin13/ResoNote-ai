  "lyrics": "Am so wrong\r\nFor staying up late\r\nGoing out with my friends\r\nFor drinking too much\r\nAnd saying I won't, but I'll do it again\r\nBut you take my hand\n\nI realize I can be who I am\n\n'Cause I'll be alright\n\nAs long as I'm leaving with you\n\n\n\nI came with the hard times\n\nBut you brought the good times\n\nYou make my life brighter, brighter\n\nI found my way\n\nYou're only gonna love me\n\nYou're never gonna judge me\n\nNow I'm coming higher, higher every day\n\n\n\nI'm keeping my head up\n\nI'm keeping my head up, head up (oh-oh)\n\nI'm keeping my head up, head up (oh-oh)\n\nYeah, I owe it to you\n\nFor making me so good\n\nFor keeping my head up\n\nYou're keeping my head up\n\n\n\nHow many times\n\nHow many times have I said I was good\n\nThat every night\n\nYou light me up like my last cigarette\n\nWith you by my side\n\nI don't really care what the neighbors might think\n\n'Cause I'll be alright\n\nAs long as I'm leaving with you\n\n\n\nI came with the hard times\n\nBut you brought the good times\n\nYou make my life brighter, brighter\n\nI found my way\n\nYou're only gonna love me\n\nYou're never gonna judge me\n\nNow I'm coming higher, higher every day\n\n\n\nI'm keeping my head up\n\nI'm keeping my head up, head up (oh-oh)\n\nI'm keeping my head up, head up (oh-oh)\n\nYeah, I owe it to you\n\nFor making me so good\n\nFor keeping my head up\n\nYou're keeping my head up\n\n\n\nI'm keeping my head up, head up (oh-oh)\n\nI'm keeping my head up, head up (oh-oh)\n\nYeah, I owe it to you\n\nFor making me so good\n\nFor keeping my head up\n\nYou're keeping my head up",
