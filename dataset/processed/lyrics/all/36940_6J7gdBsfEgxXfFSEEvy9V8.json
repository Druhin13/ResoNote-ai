  "lyrics": "Carpathian forest\r\nWhere the trees are endless\r\nForest titans fall to rest\r\nA bed is made for the queen\r\nMushrooms gather in circles\n\n\n\nWhere bears walk\n\nDereliction houses dark spirits\n\nA comet falls deep into darkness\n\n\n\nStones rise in circles\n\n\n\nWhere drums roar\n\nWater wispers vibrating\n\nPeople dance under the moon\n\n\n\nIn circles\n\n\n\nBone to Rune\n\nSkull to Dust\n\nIce melts the thoughts of the gods\n\nRoot promises blossom",
