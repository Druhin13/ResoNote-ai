  "lyrics": "Well, who'd have believed this seasoned connoisseur lady-killer\r\nlike me\r\nWould get hurt by a girl like you?\r\nAnd they got names for dirty little girls like you, honey\r\nIt ain't nice, but they call you \"everybody's girl\"\n\nAnd they say: \"Here she comes, here she comes, here she comes\"\n\nAnd they say: \" here she comes, here she comes, here she comes\n\nThere goes everybody's girl\n\nEverybody's girl, everybody's girl, everybody's girl\"\n\n\n\nYou might say I was blind for a while\n\nI fell asleep at the driving wheel\n\nYou sure woke me up in a hurry, honey\n\nAnd I can't blame anyone but me I know\n\nIt's my fault for falling for everybody's girl\n\n\n\nAnd they say: \"He's the one, he's the one, he's the one\"\n\nAnd they say: \"He's the one, he's the one, he's the one\n\n\n\nHe got screwed by everybody's girl\n\nEverybody's girl, everybody's girl, everybody's girl\n\n\n\nYou got no apparent sensitivity\n\nYou're cut deep with self-destructivity\n\nYour mind's made up, you're heading for the day\n\nWhen you'll shake and your heart breaks\n\nIt's gonna come\n\n\n\nEverybody's girl, everybody's girl\n\nEverybody's girl, everybody's girl\n\nEverybody's girl - you know the time's gonna come\n\nEverybody's girl - you can't do this forever\n\nEverybody's girl - you're not gonna get another chance\n\nEverybody's girl - you're gonna get it!",
