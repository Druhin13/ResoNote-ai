  "lyrics": "Covered in dust\r\nThe wings of my porcelain dove\r\nThey don't trouble the waters my love\r\nFrozen in time\r\nFragile to touch\r\nShe melts like the words on my tongue\n\nThe Goddess of heavenly love\n\nFades out the side\n\n\n\nOhh, your stories are few\n\nI get lost in you\n\nYou\n\n(Flap)\n\n(Flap)\n\n\n\nDark was the night\n\nHer shape and avoiding my eyes\n\nIt was black but so violently bright\n\nLike the birth of a sun\n\nSo I cried out\n\nBut my voice could not be heard aloud\n\nFor health she is safe in my mind\n\nThe bird is done\n\n\n\nOhh, your stories are few\n\nI get lost in you\n\nYou\n\n(Flap)\n\n(Flap)\n\n\n\n(Like the birth of a sun)\n\n(Flap)\n\nGimmie that gimmie that",
