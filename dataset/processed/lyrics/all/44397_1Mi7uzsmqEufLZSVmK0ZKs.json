  "lyrics": "I have been warned by the wind and I shall not go\r\nClouds on the horizon where the wind blows\r\nI see the sun in the west light up the sky\r\nThat is where me and my horse will ride\r\nFar away from the storm, lightning and rain\n\nThough the thunder may roar, soon it will fade\n\nWe'll find a [?] where only light will shine\n\nThat is where me and my horse will ride\n\n\n\nOh light, glorious light, I will follow you\n\nSkies will always be forever blue\n\n\n\nI've spend most of my days fighting the dark\n\nNow that I've turned away, the clouds they have parted\n\nI know the sun is always bound to rise\n\nWe'll be fine, my horse and I\n\n\n\nOh light, glorious light, I will follow you\n\nSkies will always be forever blue\n\nSkies will always be forever blue",
