  "lyrics": "And as the sun goes down\r\nAnd the stars come out to play\r\nAnd then tomorrow I’ll be sleeping\r\nI’ll be sleeping all day\r\nAnd this fire I feel\r\nWhy does it burn so slowly?\n\nCan’t stop thinking of you\n\nLike the five pounds you owe me\n\n\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nYou’re all I can find\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\n\n\nPlease tell me that you feel the same\n\nThat we're on the same train\n\nIf you're a little bit late and miss it\n\nThat would be a great shame\n\nI miss your sweet, sweet kisses and lovin’\n\nWhen they were mine\n\nWhen are you down?\n\nMake sure I’m in town\n\n\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nYou’re all I can find\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nYou’re all I can find\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\n\n\nAll the colours they shine through\n\nNight time, and I’m thinking of you\n\nI storm through every day\n\nYou’re on my mind\n\n\n\n\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nYou’re all I can find\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nCos you’re on my mind\n\nYou’re all I can find\n\nCos you’re on my mind",
