  "lyrics": "I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand\r\nInto the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man\r\nI'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town\r\nHe'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around\r\nThis is your hometown\r\nYour hometown\n\nYour hometown\n\nYour hometown \n\nIn `65 tension was running high at my high school\n\nThere was a lot of fights between the black and white\n\nThere was nothing you could do\n\nTwo cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun\n\nWords were passed in a shotgun blast\n\nTroubled times had come to my hometown\n\nMy hometown\n\nMy hometown\n\nMy hometown\n\n\n\nNow Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores \n\nSeems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more\n\nThey're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks\n\nForeman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back to\n\nyour hometown\n\nYour hometown\n\nYour hometown\n\nYour hometown\n\n\n\nLast night me and Kate we laid in bed talking about getting out\n\nPacking up our bags maybe heading south\n\nI'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now\n\nLast night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look\n\naround\n\nThis is your hometown",
