  "lyrics": "I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence\r\nSometimes, I did the same\r\nIf these walls could talk \nIf these walls could talk \nIf these walls could talk \n\nIf these walls could talk \n\nIf these walls could talk \n\nIf these walls could talk \n\n\n\nSex, she just want to close her eyes and sway\n\nIf you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out\n\nIts true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey\n\nSay hey, everyone deserves a night to play\n\nAnd shes plays only when you tell her no\n\n\n\nIf these walls could talk\n\nI can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you\n\nIf these walls could talk\n\nI love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it\n\n\n\nIf these walls could talk they'd tell me to swim good\n\nNo boat I float better than he would\n\nNo life jacket I'm not the guard in Nazareth\n\nBut your flood can be misunderstood\n\nWall telling me they full of pain, resentment\n\nNeed someone to live in them just to relieve tension\n\nMe? I'm just a tenant\n\nMy lord said these walls vacant more than a minute\n\nThese walls are vulnerable exclamation\n\nInterior pink color coordinated\n\nI interrogated every nook and cranny\n\nI mean its still amazing before they couldn't stand me\n\nThese walls want to cry tears\n\nThese walls happier when I'm here\n\nThese walls never could hold up\n\nEverytime I come around demolition might crush\n\n\n\nIf these walls could talk\n\nI can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you\n\nIf these walls could talk\n\nI love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it\n\n\n\nIf these walls could talk they'd tell me to go deep\n\nYelling at me continuously I can see\n\nYour defense mechanism is my decision\n\nKnock these walls down that's my religion\n\nWalls feeling like they ready to close in\n\nI suffocate then catch my second wind\n\nI resonate in these walls\n\nI don't know how long I can wait in these walls\n\nI've been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in\n\nThey sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest\n\nI beg to differ, I must've missed them\n\nI'm not involved I'd rather diss them\n\nI'd rather call all you put your wall up\n\nCause when I come around demolition gon' crush\n\n\n\nIf these walls could talk\n\nI can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you\n\nIf these walls could talk\n\nI love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it\n\n\n\nIf your walls could talk they'd tell you it's too late\n\nYour destiny accepted your fate\n\nBurn accessories and stash them where they are\n\nTake the recipe, the bible and god\n\nWall telling you that commissary is low\n\nRace wars happening no calling CO\n\nNo calling your mother to save you\n\nHomies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable\n\nYour behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch\n\nWalls is telling me you a bitch\n\nYou pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them\n\nThat sentence so important\n\nWalls telling you to listen to \"Sing About Me\"\n\nRetaliation is strong you even dream about me\n\nKilled my homeboy and God spared your life\n\nDumb criminal got indicted the same night\n\nSo when you play this song rewind the first verse\n\nAbout me abusing my power so you can hurt\n\nAbout me and her in the shower whenever she horny\n\nAbout me and her in the after hours of the morning\n\nAbout her baby daddy currently serving life\n\nAnd how she think about you until we meet up at night\n\nAbout the only girl that cared about you when you asked her\n\nAnd how she fucking on a famous rapper\n\nWalls could talk\n\n\n\nI remember you was conflicted\n\nMisusing your influence\n\nSometimes I did the same\n\nAbusing my power full of resentment\n\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\n\nFound myself screaming in a hotel room",
