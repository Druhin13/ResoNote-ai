  "lyrics": "It takes a long time to kill a man\r\nFifty-five years at least\r\nUntil he breaks down\r\nStarts to look underground\r\nAnd go off and get him some peace\n\nI want to die a lot quicker than that\n\nIf it's my only way out\n\nI've been counting up the cost\n\nGetting up on that cross\n\nWanna know what this is all about\n\n\n\nFather time\n\nSteals our days\n\nLike a thief\n\nThere's no Price\n\nThat I wouldn't pay\n\nTo get some relief\n\nI've become\n\nThe empy shell\n\nOf a man I like so well\n\nI am a living, breathing hell\n\nCome on and resurrect me\n\n\n\nI tried to drown the pain with a friend of mine\n\nIt didn't seem to help\n\nOh, she's got a pretty face with a wedding lace\n\nBut I'm still waking up with myself\n\n\n\nI know what it means to choke it down\n\nDriving 'til your legs get weak\n\nI know what it's like on a Saturday night\n\nTo be alone in a crowded street\n\n\n\nFather time\n\nSteals our days\n\nLike a thief\n\nThere's no Price\n\nThat I haven't paid\n\nTo get some relief\n\nI've become\n\nThe shell of a man\n\nI can't begin to even understand\n\nHave I forgotten who I am?\n\nCome on and resurrect me\n\nResurrect me\n\nResurrect me\n\nResurrect me\n\nResurrect me\n\nResurrect me\n\nCome on and resurrect me",
