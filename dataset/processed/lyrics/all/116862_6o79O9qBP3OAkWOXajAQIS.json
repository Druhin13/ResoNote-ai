Are you crazy?\n\nPocket rocket in my cargos, like the Navy\n\nPut this Tommy to his brain, please, like he Brady\n\nHeartbreakin' on the daily, can you save me?\n\nWhy is bitches tryna play me? Are you crazy?\n\nI can't let her have my baby, you not my baby\n\nI can't let her have my baby, I'm actin' shady\n\nHeartbreaking on the daily, can you save me?\n\n\n\nY'all gotta move, give me some room, I'm 'bout to shoot\n\nBoom! Everybody runnin' out the room\n\nBoom! Everybody beggin' \"Don't shoot\"\n\nBoom! Nigga, who the fuck asked you?\n\nYou a bum, are you dumb? Try me, I got this gun\n\nRun, nigga, if I'm here, don't come\n\nBitch, you was expectin' for me to hit\n\nThat's a dub, I know you put a hole in that shit\n\n\n\nSawed off in the damn drawer\n\nGot the .30 in my drawers, gotta hold my pants up\n\nOnly time she ever call is for the banana\n\nI don't even check my call log, I don't answer\n\n\n\nWhy this bitch tryna play me? Are you crazy?\n\nPocket rocket in my cargos, like the Navy\n\nPut this Tommy to his brain, please, like he Brady\n\nHeartbreakin' on the daily, can you save me?\n\n\n\nWhy this bitch tryna play me? Is she crazy?\n\nThat bitch know I'm number one, like Tracy McGrady\n\nKnow I got this .380, it's on safety\n\nI know all these niggas hate me, won't let it faze me\n\nFuck nigga\n\n\n\nI'ma swerve in the Maybach, I'ma do some damage\n\nNiggas sit the fuck down if you don't understand us\n\nI heard niggas talkin' 'bout they gon' run down on us\n\nPull up windows down in the fuckin' Lamb' truck\n\n\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na, yeah\n\nScott Storch",
