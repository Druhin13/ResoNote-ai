  "lyrics": "We must all unite for we are one creation\r\nWe must join the fight, together we are strong\r\nWe must do what's right in every situation\r\nLove each other's lives as you would do your own\r\nJust think twice\n\nBefore you cast your stone at someone's soul\n\nIt's their life\n\nSo the choice is theirs and theirs alone\n\n\n\nWe're not here to judge\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no room for hate\n\nWe are just one human race\n\nWe must rise above\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no time to waste anymore\n\n\n\nWe must all unite, there's no more segregation\n\nWhen you've seen the light there's nowhere else to go\n\nAnd with peace in sight no walls could separate us\n\nWe would be as one because this earth's our home\n\n\n\nJust think twice\n\nBefore you cast your stone at someone's soul\n\nIt's their life\n\nSo the choice is theirs and theirs alone\n\n\n\nWe're not here to judge\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no room to hate\n\nWe are just one human race\n\nWe must rise above\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no time to waste anymore\n\n\n\nWill we learn from our past?\n\nOur clock is running fast\n\n\n\nWe're not here to judge\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no room for hate\n\nThere is just one human race\n\nWe must rise above\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no time to waste anymore\n\n\n\nWe're not here to judge\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no room for hate\n\nWe are just one human race\n\nWe must rise above\n\nWe are here to love\n\nThere's no time to waste anymore",
