  "lyrics": "I can feel you running underneath my skin\r\nWanna break through, but something isn't right within\r\nHolding me back, leaving me so broken, bruised and pitiful\r\nQuestion my ability to find myself again\r\nAnd I say no, I'm just gonna sing louder\n\nI'm gonna pick up the pieces so I can be whole again\n\nI've got a million reasons why I feel alive within\n\nI'm not afraid\n\nOh, I'm just gonna sing louder\n\nI'm just gonna stand taller\n\nI believe in no ghost\n\n\n\nI don't need you, your words will never leave a mark\n\nI can see you, a shadow hiding in the dark\n\nHolding me back, leaving me so broken, bruised and beautiful\n\nQuestion my abilities no more, no more\n\nAnd say no, I'm just gonna sing louder\n\n\n\nI'm gonna pick up the pieces so I can be whole again\n\nI've got a million reasons why I feel alive within\n\nI'm not afraid\n\nOh, I'm just gonna sing louder\n\nI'm just gonna stand taller\n\nI believe in no ghost\n\n\n\nI'm just gonna sing louder\n\nI'm just gonna sing louder\n\n\n\nI'm gonna pick up the pieces so I can be whole again\n\nI've got a million reasons why I feel alive within\n\nI'm not afraid\n\nOh, I'm just gonna sing louder\n\nI'm just gonna stand taller\n\nI believe in no ghost",
