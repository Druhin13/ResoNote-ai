  "lyrics": "I don't feel it anymore, the anchor holding me in place\r\nI've come un-tethered to the shore to anyone I can relate\r\nOh I am lighter than a stone\r\nAnd I go wherever the wind blows\r\nAnd I am always on my own\r\nSo I'll be on my way before too long\n\n\n\nI don't hear them anymore, the voices that congratulate\n\nI'm taking less and giving more to everyone to love and hate\n\nOh I've been laying out my soul\n\nAnd I've been going wherever the winds blown\n\nAnd I fear I'm on my own\n\nSo I'll be on my way before too long\n\n\n\nOh I have found, you can lose who you are if no ones around\n\nI've come to know it's the ones you love that bring you home\n\nOh I am lighter than a stone\n\nAnd I don't know where the wind may blow\n\nBut I am out here on my own\n\nSinging oh oh oh",
