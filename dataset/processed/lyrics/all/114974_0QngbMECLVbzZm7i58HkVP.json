  "lyrics": "I always find the most creative ways to destroy myself\r\nYeah, I can tear me down better than anybody else\r\nI don't need your help, I don't need your help\r\nYou've been pouring gasoline in your living room\r\nLight a cigarette while you complain about the fumes\r\nWho are you to talk?\n\nWho are you to talk?\n\nWho are you to talk?\n\n\n\nYou're so shook when I catch on fire\n\nSo surprised when I have an answer\n\nGuess no one told you, now I told you\n\nWe're not living in the forties\n\nAin't it weird when I'm thinking stuff?\n\n\n\nOh, come on, just say something\n\nNo, go ahead, tell me, what do I need?\n\nI'm not the kind of girl you undo\n\nI'm not the kind of girl you undo\n\nOh, come on, oh, come on\n\nI've been undone long before you\n\n\n\nYou can't tie your favourite noose around my neck\n\nCut me down when I turn blue and act like I'm the wreck\n\nI don't need your help\n\nI don't need your help\n\nI don't need your help\n\n\n\nYou're so shook when I look right past you\n\nSo surprised you don't get an answer\n\nGuess no one told you, now I told you\n\nWe're not living in the forties\n\nAin't it weird to feel small 'n stuff?\n\n\n\nOh, come on, just say something\n\nNo, go ahead, tell me, what do I need?\n\nI'm not the kind of girl you undo\n\nI'm not the kind of girl you undo\n\nOh, come on, oh, come on\n\nI've been undone long before you\n\n\n\nYou've been holding all I have over open flames\n\nStepping into Hades while you're calling out my name\n\nI won't follow you\n\n\n\nOh, come on, make this easy\n\nOh, come on, just say something\n\nOh, come on, just say something\n\nNo, go ahead, tell me, what do I need?\n\nI'm not the kind of girl you undo\n\nI'm not the kind of girl you undo\n\nOh, come on, oh, come on\n\nI've been undone long before you\n\nI've been undone long before you",
