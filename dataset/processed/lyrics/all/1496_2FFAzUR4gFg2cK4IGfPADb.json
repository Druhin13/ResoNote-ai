  "lyrics": "In a perfect world\r\nOf my own design\r\nI'd get rid of the sun\r\nIn favor of the moonshine\r\nAnd if the natural order\n\nWere mine to define\n\nThe light in the tunnel\n\nWould be a neon sign\n\n\n\n'Cause I've always thought the nighttime\n\nIt feels like mine\n\nIf it were only up to me\n\nThe sun would never ever shine\n\n\n\nWell the moon's invitation\n\nIt's gentle and it's kind\n\nAnd it leaves everyone alone\n\nAnd to me that is divine\n\n\n\nWith its mightiest demonstration\n\nI feel so much less confined\n\nAnd towards that kind of light\n\nI will always be inclined\n\n\n\n'Cause I've always thought the nighttime\n\nIt feels like mine\n\nIf it were only up to me\n\nThe sun would never ever shine\n\n\n\nIf I could go out on a limb\n\nAnd make so bold a leap\n\nI'd tell you, sun\n\nTo go down\n\nAnd sink into the deep\n\n\n\n'Cause I've always thought the nighttime\n\nIt feels like mine\n\nIf it were only up to me\n\nThe sun would never ever shine",
