  "lyrics": "I was biding my time, desperately, I walked the line\r\nBetween health and poverty\r\nLooked into a face, all my thoughts they were replaced\r\nI had the nerve to call it soul\r\nGet love where you find it\n\nIt’s the only fist we have to fight with\n\nAnd soon, you’re headed back to earth\n\n\n\nFound myself along a path, trailed all my steps back\n\nFound a place to relearn to relax\n\nRested like an empty cage and where the moon\n\nStarts everyday\n\nAnd I can dress up like a saint\n\n\n\nTwice I’ve been around the world and I’m sure\n\nThere ain’t no one living no more no choice\n\nBut to buy all your own time\n\nSpend all your money at the casket store",
