  "lyrics": "You can take me to paradise,\r\nAnd then again you can be cold as ice\r\nI'm over my head,\r\nBut it sure feels nice.\r\nYou can take me anytime you like,\r\nI'll be around if you think you might love me baby,\n\nAnd hold me tight.\n\nYour mood is like a circus wheel,\n\nYou're changing all the time,\n\nSometimes I can't help but feel,\n\nThat I'm wasting all of my time.\n\nThink I'm looking on the dark side,\n\nBut everyday you hurt my pride,\n\nI'm over my head,\n\nBut it sure feels nice,\n\nI'm over my head,\n\nBut it sure feels nice.",
