  "lyrics": "The way you wear your hat\r\nThe way you sip your tea\r\nThe memory of all that\r\nNo, no! They can't take that away from me!\r\nThe way your smile just beams,\n\nThe way you sing off key,\n\nThe way you haunt my dreams,\n\nNo, no! They can't take that away from me!\n\n\n\nWe may never, never meet again\n\nOn the bumpy road to love\n\nBut I'll always, always keep the memory of\n\n\n\nThe way you hold your knife\n\nThe way we danced till three\n\nThe way you've changed my life\n\nNo, no! They can't take that away from me!\n\nNo! They can't take that away from me!\n\n\n\nWe may never, never meet again\n\nOn the bumpy road to love\n\nStill I'll always, always keep the memory of\n\n\n\nThe way you hold your knife\n\nThe way we danced till three\n\nThe way you've changed my life\n\nNo, no! They can't take that away from me!\n\nNo! They can't take that away\n\nNo! They can't take that away\n\nNo! They can't take that away from me!",
