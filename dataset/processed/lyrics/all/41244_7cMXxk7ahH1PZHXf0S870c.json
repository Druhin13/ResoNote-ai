  "lyrics": "(Springfield, Tosti, Tate)\r\nHeart in my mouth, pulse in my head\r\nMercury rising into the red\r\nThe smell of your skin can light up all the fires in me\n\nHungry to touch, I'm eager to please\n\nOut of control and I hand you the keys\n\nEvery night I am burning to make love to you\n\n\n\nBut don't try to tell me you think it's all physical\n\nIt goes much deeper than that\n\n\n\nYou ought to know it's an affair of the heart\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nIt's an affair of the heart\n\nIt's an affair of the heart\n\nHave a little blind faith, believe\n\nIt's an affair of the heart\n\n\n\nWhen we make love, it's a passionate thing\n\nYou shudder and shake, sink your teeth in my skin\n\nI almost believe you were made to be played by my hands\n\n\n\nAnd you got the power, it amazes me still\n\nHow you play my emotions with consummate skill\n\nI don't have to look any further than into your eyes\n\n\n\nSo don't try to tell me you think it's just physical\n\nIt goes way deeper than that\n\nYou better know it's an affair of the heart\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nDon't try to tell me you think it's all physical\n\nIt goes much deeper than that\n\nYou ought to know it's an affair of the heart\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nYou better know it's an affair of the heart\n\nIt's an affair of the heart\n\nYou better know it's an affair of the heart\n\n\n\n[Chorus]",
