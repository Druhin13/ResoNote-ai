  "lyrics": "Never too late you can come through\r\nI'll be up waiting\r\nI don't want nobody but you\r\nNo hesitating\r\n'Cause every time you leave I fall apart\r\nBoy you're the missing pieces of my heart\n\n\n\nAnd I try to let you go but you resist and pull me back\n\nAnd I try to be alone but you persist, I've met my match\n\n\n\nProceed with caution, don't be dishonest\n\nI need you closer to love me harder\n\nProceed with caution, face to face\n\nAnd touch me in a different kind of way\n\nProceed with caution, but don't make me wait\n\nBefore too long it just might fade away\n\nProceed with caution\n\n\n\nNever enough gimme your touch\n\nDon't wanna waste time\n\nYou lift me up, give me that rush\n\nTell me it's all mine\n\nI'll give up everything to be right where you are\n\nI'll follow you from here like you're the northern star\n\n\n\nAnd I try to let you go but you resist and pull me back\n\nAnd I try to be alone but you persist, I've met my match\n\n\n\nProceed with caution, don't be dishonest\n\nI need you closer to love me harder\n\nProceed with caution, face to face\n\nAnd touch me in a different kind of way\n\nProceed with caution, but don't make me wait\n\nBefore too long it just might fade away\n\nProceed with caution\n\n\n\nDo you want more material possessions? Ain't nothing\n\nDo you want more? Can you commit to be my everything?\n\nDo you want more? Baby convince me with the words you sing\n\nIf you wanna be more to me, you must proceed with caution\n\nCaution, caution, caution\n\nCaution, caution, caution\n\nCaution, caution\n\nProceed with caution\n\n\n\nProceed with caution, don't be dishonest\n\nI need you closer to love me harder\n\nProceed with caution, face to face\n\nAnd touch me in a different kind of way\n\nProceed with caution, don't be dishonest\n\nI need you closer to love me harder\n\nProceed with caution, face to face\n\nAnd touch me in a different kind of way\n\nProceed with caution, but don't make me wait\n\nBefore too long it just might fade away\n\nProceed with caution",
