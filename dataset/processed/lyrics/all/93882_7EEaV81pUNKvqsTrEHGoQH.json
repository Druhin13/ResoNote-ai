  "lyrics": "Spinning around my mental now\r\nOh, my head’s been filled with doubt\r\nWhat I kept inside will eat me alive\r\nOr will it keep me safe and sound?\r\n'Cause I’m half alive\n\nNumb inside\n\nDying to feel\n\nI’m dying to feel\n\n\n\nI can’t feel anything\n\nSo lost and I can’t be saved\n\nYour voice but a memory\n\nFade to black and erase the pain\n\nErase the pain\n\nFade to black and erase the pain\n\n\n\nLosing a piece of what I found\n\nLosing myself in all this crowd\n\nIf I told you I’d die\n\nWould you keep me alive?\n\nOh, would you save me from myself?\n\n\n\nHalf alive\n\nNumb inside\n\nDying to feel\n\nI’m dying to feel\n\n\n\nI can’t feel anything\n\nSo lost and I can’t be saved\n\nYour voice but a memory\n\nFade to black and erase the pain\n\nErase the pain\n\nFade to black and erase the pain\n\n\n\nI pretend, I pretend\n\nI pretend 'til I bend and bend\n\n'Til I’m broken\n\nAre you broken?\n\nI forget, I forget\n\nI forget 'til it crept and crept\n\nAm I hopeless?\n\nAre you hopeless?\n\n\n\nI can’t feel anything\n\nSo lost and I can’t be saved\n\nYour voice but a memory\n\nFade to black and erase the pain\n\nI can’t feel anything\n\nFade to black and erase the pain\n\nI can’t feel anything\n\nFade to black and erase the pain",
