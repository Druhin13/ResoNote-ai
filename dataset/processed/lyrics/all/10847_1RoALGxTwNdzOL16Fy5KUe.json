  "lyrics": "Don't you know I wish I was closer?\r\nI'll be watching over\r\nAnd if you're too small to see\r\nI'll lift on my shoulders\r\nIf you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'\n\nI wanna be there in the morning\n\nSo, I'm working through the night\n\nAnd I'll be smiling at you yawning\n\nWhen you're rubbing those brown eyes\n\nAnd if you ever leave me, call me\n\nI wanna make sure you're alright\n\nI don't wanna be so far from home\n\nYou know you're daddy's little soldier\n\nAnd your mother's handsome knight\n\nNow, don't you worry about darkness\n\n'Cause you're carrying the light\n\nAnd those shadows fall when you're around\n\n\n\nDon't you know I wish I was closer?\n\nI'll be watching over\n\nAnd if you're too small to see\n\nI'll lift on my shoulders\n\nIf you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'\n\n\n\nI want you close to me like songbirds want the trees\n\n'Cause when your close to me my worries flee from me\n\n'Cause when I'm with you, my feet don't touch the ground\n\nNow, I'm not a king\n\nBut when I'm with you I feel like I'm wearing a crown\n\nFor you I sing, for you I sing, for you I sing\n\n\n\nDon't you know I wish I was closer?\n\nI'll be watching over\n\nAnd if you're too small to see\n\nI'll lift on my shoulders\n\nIf you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'\n\nOh, don't you know I wish I was closer?\n\nI'll be watching over\n\nAnd if you're too small to see\n\nI'll lift on my shoulders\n\nIf you're feeling low, I'll hold ya'\n\n\n\nDon't you know I wish I was closer\n\nI'll be watching over",
