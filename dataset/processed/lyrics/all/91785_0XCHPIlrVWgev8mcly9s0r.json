  "lyrics": "I woke up this morning, hungover all alone\r\nWent to fix a cup of coffee, but the coffee pot was gone\r\nThought the world was ending, and I got left behind\r\nBut all that really happened was she meant it this time\r\nNow she's southbound, loaded down up to the top\r\nI'm just sitting here in this empty box\n\n\n\nShe took my ride, took my pride, all the whiskey I drank\n\nShe took my 3030, took them dirty dishes from the sink\n\nGuess I'll stare at the square where our pictures used to be\n\n'Cause all she left was me\n\n\n\nWell, I'd put on some records, hell, try and get her gone\n\nBut I ain't got a needle or a groove to drop it on\n\nGuess the silver line is ain't gotta lock my door\n\nYou can't steal what ain't hear anymore\n\n\n\nTook my cigars, my guitar, even took my dog\n\nShe took the mail, took the white-tailed buck off my wall\n\nSo I'm sitting here now where the couch used to be\n\n'Cause all she left was me\n\nYeah, that's right, all she left (Woo!)\n\n\n\nI'd clean up my act, but she took the broom\n\nShe better hope her next man's got a whole lot of room\n\n\n\nShe took my ride, took my pride, took my new flatscreen\n\nShe took the girl of my dreams out the songs that I sing\n\nI guess I'll stare at the square where our pictures used to be\n\n'Cause all she left was me, yeah\n\nMan, if I could find my wallet, I'd go drown in a drink\n\nBut all she left was me, yeah, that's right\n\n\n\nAll she left, all she left\n\nAll she left was me (Woo!)\n\nAll she left, all she left\n\nAll she left was me, yeah",
