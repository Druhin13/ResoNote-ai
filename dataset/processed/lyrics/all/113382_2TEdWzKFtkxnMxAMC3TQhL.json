  "lyrics": "And her eyes hurt the way they do\r\nAlmost like they'd seen,\r\nAlmost like they knew\r\nAnd her words, soft as they could be\r\nTied me to her soul and wouldn't set me free\n\n\n\nAnd the night that held us in its arms\n\nIt held us once again,\n\nBut even then I knew this time\n\nThat I would decline\n\nSweet Rosemary's Wine\n\n\n\nLately I, seem to be inclined\n\nMore to being cold, less to being kind\n\nAnd I suppose that I've been less than true\n\nBeing what I am, what was I to do\n\n\n\nSo I drink\n\nThe sweetness of her soul\n\nAnd drink it once again\n\nBut even then I guess I'd known\n\nThat I would decline\n\nSweet Rosemary's wine",
