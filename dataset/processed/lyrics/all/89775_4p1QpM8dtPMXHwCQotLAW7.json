  "lyrics": "Lately I've been living on gin and adrenaline\r\nTryna play a game I can never win\r\nIn a part of town where they never smile, never grin\r\nOh, what a situation a fella's in\r\nStaying on the move like Bedouin\r\nCan't find a place for me to settle in\n\nDon't know which direction I'm headin' in\n\n\n\nThey're spreadin' rumours, but rumours ain't true\n\nThat I'd be better off without you\n\nBut my heart beats when you call me\n\n\n\nAll my friends they tell me I'm\n\nLetting these good times pass me by\n\nThey say I'm crazy to love you\n\nCrazy to love you\n\nFeeling like time is all slow-mo\n\nBut if I run, where do I go?\n\nI know I'm crazy to love you\n\nCrazy to love you\n\n\n\nWondering where various lovers went\n\nPondering the days when I was innocent\n\nCan't trust the news or the government\n\nSensationalist chasing the new event\n\nIf I had you to represent, lady\n\nMaybe then I would repent daily\n\nI feel like you're the one they'd send, baby\n\nI know I can't wait until the city saves me\n\n\n\nThey're spreadin' rumours, but rumours ain't true\n\nThat I'd be better off without you\n\nBut my heart beats when you call me\n\n\n\nAll my friends they tell me I'm\n\nLetting these good times pass me by\n\nThey say I'm crazy to love you\n\nCrazy to love you\n\nFeeling like time is all slow-mo\n\nBut if I run, where do I go?\n\nI know I'm crazy to love you\n\nCrazy to love you\n\n\n\nI come alive when the sun goes down\n\nI'll be alright if you stay around\n\nYou're the only truth that I've found\n\nSo don't you lie, don't you lie\n\n\n\nI come alive when the sun goes down\n\nI'll be alright if you stay around\n\nYou're the only truth that I've found\n\nSo don't you lie\n\n\n\nAll my friends they tell me I'm\n\nLetting these good times pass me by\n\nThey say I'm crazy to love you\n\nCrazy to love you\n\nFeeling like time is all slow-mo\n\nBut if I run, where do I go?\n\nI know I'm crazy to love you\n\nCrazy to love you",
