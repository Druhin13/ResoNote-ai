I felt hardships, I'm tired of that shit, I'm good, bro\n\nYo. I'm tryna, I'm tryna tell the world to fucking relax, bro. Relax, let me be me, let me be my- let me be a prince\n\nLet me be a king, nigga\n\nOff the sense of my mind, 'cause nigga\n\nMy mind is different, you feel me?\n\nI'm not with that torturin' shit, bro, I'm not with that, bro\n\nTo be appreciated and to be loved, bro\n\nLet a nigga assert himself, bruh\n\nLet a nigga be who he wanna be\n\nIf I make my mistakes, if I make my mistakes along the road\n\nThen that's my fault, you feel me?
