  "lyrics": "Mama put brother on the prayer list\r\nWhen he got caught smoking that pot\r\nDaddy found out, first thing he could grab\r\nAnd he whipped him with a Zebco rod\r\nWhen we messed up, she'd fill us up\r\nWith the scripture and a baptist hymn\n\nAnd she prayed we’d be a little more like her\n\nAnd whole lotta less like him\n\n\n\nMama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels\n\nShe was red-letter Heaven, he was Old No. 7\n\nBetween the two of 'em, wasn't nothing they couldn’t handle\n\nMama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels\n\n\n\nHe hated how she never had no fun\n\nShe hated how he had too much\n\nI got a little bit from both of them\n\nA little Bible and a little buzz\n\nI wound up turning out, smack dab in-between\n\nHis taste for Lynchburg and her grace from John 3:16\n\n\n\nMama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels\n\nShe was red-letter Heaven, he was Old No. 7\n\nBetween the two of 'em, wasn't nothing they couldn't handle\n\nMama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels\n\n\n\nI'm a little \"Hell yeah,\" I'm a little \"Hallelujah\"\n\nIf there's a stool or a pew, I might sit down next to ya\n\n\n\nMama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels\n\nShe was red-letter Heaven, he was Old No. 7\n\nBetween the two of 'em, wasn’t nothing they couldn’t handle\n\nMama loved Jesus, Daddy loved Jack Daniels",
