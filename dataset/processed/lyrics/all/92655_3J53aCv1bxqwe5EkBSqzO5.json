  "lyrics": "When I die\r\nI want to travel light\r\nOr rinse my hands\r\nSo I catch the satellite\r\nDon't cry\r\nI promise that I'll get it right\n\nI've been practicing my whole life\n\n\n\nWhen I'm fine\n\nI become a different man\n\nAll these distances and abandoned light\n\nIn time, passing forces did collide\n\nInto her arms of rot\n\nAnd it was alright\n\n\n\nNow I, I feel right\n\nWhat would death steal that could harm me?\n\nNow I feel right\n\nIn the darkest lair\n\nI feel right again",
