  "lyrics": "If you are right\r\nThis happens all for every human being\r\nColoring all of us unnoticed\r\nStill, I lie\r\nStronger than energies riding on my back\r\nAnchoring every day to their last\n\n\n\nI know it's real\n\nAnd it echoes me without any sigh\n\nScience is something artificial\n\nIt is my companion now as it all goes dark\n\nDay-dreaming only left it's meaning\n\nAnd this is all I ask of it\n\n\n\nTime aptly fades\n\nI'll break the dam flush over on my face\n\nDo you see through their love\n\nThrough their weight\n\nAll of my life\n\nHow every finger-ring bring lumps of gold\n\nAncestry never leaves us alone\n\n\n\nI know it's real\n\nAnd it echoes me without any sigh\n\nScience is something artificial\n\nIt is my companion now as it all goes dark\n\nDay-dreaming I am not my shadow\n\nAnd this is all you need to know",
