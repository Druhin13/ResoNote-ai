  "lyrics": "Getting lost in the thrill\r\nWe were high up in the hills, no track of time\r\nWe slow it down, keep it real\r\nWe could lie for the night, I'll be here\r\nParadise in your eyes\n\nBut I'm not yours and you're not mine\n\nYou say you never want to go\n\nBut if you run, you know I won't\n\n\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\n\n\nSomething about you is so healing\n\nIn the haze, in the days when you're near me\n\nRunning on, on a feeling\n\nKeep it on, keep it going while I'm here\n\n\n\nParadise in your eyes\n\nBut I'm not yours and you're not mine\n\nYou say you never want to go\n\nBut if you run, you know I won't\n\n\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\n\n\nParadise in your eyes\n\nBut I'm not yours and you're not mine\n\nParadise in your eyes\n\nBut I'm not yours and you're not mine\n\n\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)\n\nLove me like I'm never gonna leave\n\nLove me like I'm yours (yours)",
