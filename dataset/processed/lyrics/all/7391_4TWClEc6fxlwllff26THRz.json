  "lyrics": "I don't like the way he treats you \nThat's not the way I would do you \nWhat gives him the right to say its you that he owns \nAll those nights he left you to cry \nLeft you with nothing but tears in your eyes \nGirl just come with me \n\nCause this house is not a home \n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nGirl he's over and gone \n\nYou don't have to hurt no more \n\nAnd I'll be there for you \n\nTo give all the love you're yearing for \n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nAnd you don't have to hurt no more \n\nBaby he's over \n\nI'm be what you're looking for \n\nLet me take over \n\nAnd you don't have to hurt no more \n\nI'll make you see \n\nI'll be what you're looking for \n\nAnd more \n\nSo you don't have to hurt \n\nYou don't have to hurt \n\n\n\nNo more \n\nHow could he look into those pretty eyes and hurt you \n\nYou don't have to hurt no more \n\nEvery day I see you with those sad eyes \n\nYou try so hard to hold back from all you cries \n\nJust come with me \n\nThere is no reason for your broken heart to stand \n\nGirl you're heart will heal \n\nFrom all the pain you feel \n\nJust let me show you the real love you've been waiting for \n\nJust close the door \n\nYou cannot take no more \n\nThere is no reason for... \n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\n\n\n[Chorus x 2]",
