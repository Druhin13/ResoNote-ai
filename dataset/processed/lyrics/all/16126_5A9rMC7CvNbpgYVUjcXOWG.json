  "lyrics": "Sitting ducks on razor blades\r\nJust waiting to be swallowed by the soup, mhm\r\nThe repetition of a bad dream\r\nA loop within a loop within a loop\r\nHere comes the feeling\n\nBut not the words\n\nIt's like a love song in reverse\n\nI just don't love you\n\nBut don't know how to say\n\nIt gets stuck in my\n\nIt gets stuck in my teeth\n\nIt gets stuck in my\n\nIt gets stuck in my teeth\n\nCan't find the words to say goodbye\n\n(Goodbye)\n\n\n\nHot tongue, cold shoulder\n\nWho am I to turn my back on you?\n\nWhy bring this back to life?\n\nWhy raise the dead?\n\nWhy hold this gun up to my head? Hm-hm\n\n\n\nHere comes the feeling\n\nBut not the words\n\nIt's like a love song in reverse\n\nI just don't love you\n\nBut don't know how to say\n\nIt gets stuck in my\n\nIt gets stuck in my teeth\n\nIt gets stuck in my\n\nIt gets stuck in my teeth\n\nCan't find the words to say goodbye\n\n\n\nNo words, no words\n\nNo words, no words\n\nNo words, no words\n\nCan't find the words to say goodbye\n\n\n\nI don't know the language\n\nI can't find the rhythm\n\nI don't know the way to say I tried\n\nI don't know the language\n\nI can't find the rhythm\n\nI don't know the way to say goodbye, bye (woo)\n\n\n\nIt gets stuck in my\n\nIt gets stuck in my teeth\n\nIt gets stuck in my\n\nIt gets stuck in my teeth\n\nCan't find the words, can't find the words\n\nCan't find the words to say goodbye\n\nCan't find the words, can't find the words\n\nCan't find the words to say goodbye",
