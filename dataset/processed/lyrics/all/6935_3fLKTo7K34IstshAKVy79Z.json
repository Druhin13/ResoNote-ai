  "lyrics": "I've been a criminal, I made a mistake\r\nBelieved in the fictional\r\nThen let everything slip away\r\nI can't accept my faith\r\nThought the alternative looked so crystal clear\r\nDrowned in the muddy waters\n\nAnd I'm living in my worst fears\n\nBegging you back through tears\n\n\n\nYou had this picture of me\n\nAnd now I have shattered your dreams\n\nI know the drill and I know the truth\n\nAnd it kills me\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm guilty\n\nDon't come near me\n\nThe one thing I'm good at is messing up somebody else\n\nBaby, I'm guilty\n\nI'm turning sweet love into poison\n\nAnd I got the scars, if you're talking 'bout hurting yourself\n\nBaby, I'm guilty as hell\n\n\n\nI sit here all alone, my defence is down\n\nWishing I could be home\n\nBut I'm locked out and it's my fault\n\nGraze's with added salt\n\nThought I would be okay without you and I\n\nNow that I realize it was all just an awful lie\n\nTake me back, I might die\n\n\n\nYou had this picture of me\n\nAnd now I have shattered your dreams\n\nI know the drill and I know the truth\n\nAnd it kills me\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm guilty\n\nDon't come near me\n\nThe one thing I'm good at is messing up somebody else\n\nBaby, I'm guilty\n\nI'm turning sweet love into poison\n\nAnd I got the scars, if you're talking 'bout hurting yourself\n\nBaby, I'm guilty as hell\n\n\n\nI should've known that I could not go on here without you\n\nInstead of walking away, know that I'll feel terrified\n\nI know I was wrong, now I'm hurting myself, I wish I knew\n\nPlease, take me back, I don't wanna believe this goodbye, oh\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm guilty\n\nDon't come near me\n\nOne thing I'm good at is messing up somebody else\n\nBaby, I'm guilty as hell (yeah, I'm guilty)\n\nOh, I'm guilty\n\nDon't come near me (but I know)\n\nOne thing I'm good at is messing up somebody else (please, forgive me darling)\n\nBaby, I'm guilty\n\nI'm turning sweet love (I'll turn sweet love) into poison (into poison, oh no)\n\nAnd I got the scars (oh no), if you're talking 'bout hurting yourself\n\nBaby, I'm guilty as hell",
