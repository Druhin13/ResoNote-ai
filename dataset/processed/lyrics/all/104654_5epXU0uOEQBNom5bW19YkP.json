  "lyrics": "As the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance\r\nI ask you to witness what revenge is\r\nMoving mountains and inches\r\nThe business is resistance\r\nPowerful as we evolve\r\nGet involved, we can get it all\n\nAltogether we could get it solved\n\nBosses that'll pay the cost\n\n\n\nYou gotta try now\n\nAin't no more [?]\n\nThis is what you\n\nYou gotta shout now\n\n[?]\n\nThis is what you want\n\n\n\nHot Juba, black Buddha, smoother than Luther\n\nOut of the womb ruthless, deliver with no toola\n\nRougher than loofas, clueless and ruthless considered nuisance\n\nBarren and fruitless, no power, a cup juiceless\n\nI aspire to inspire given devil's fire\n\nA sin higher, make profit like Jeremiah\n\nTurn the mercury to gold to extract worth\n\nAnd my circumference trying to tell me it's a flat Earth\n\nElegant aggression, glamorous suppression\n\nBallad of the bullet, immaculate conception\n\nAnd the shitty slums seeking galaxy connections\n\nTrying to follow God, hollow like a faulty log\n\nHan Solo in the Jedi, I'm unthawed\n\nHyper-vigilant and militant, en garde\n\nUnscathed, slaves free while they unchained\n\nLife's a maze, fiends live in concaves\n\n\n\nI would send you back to the bowels you're born from\n\nI raised a glass when you swallowed your forked tongue\n\nI recognize your counterfeit confidence\n\nGot me convinced that the crime is the consequence\n\nYou're a derivative of bullshit, literal\n\nUnoriginal, that's why you're miserable\n\nWe had to pick up the pieces, it wasn't difficult\n\nI guess you didn't know, your impact was minimal\n\nThe opposite of opportunism\n\nYour costume is so transparent, now you're virtually invisible\n\nThere's no such thing as a typical individual\n\nThere's nothing left except \"fuck you\" on principle\n\nSeventh of September, still running the temperature\n\nSmoking like an ember, drinking like an amateur\n\nTripping like your grandpa at the strip club without his pills\n\nMake it rain two dollar bills\n\n\n\nYo, peep the piece of scum, you conceded to become\n\nCompeting with me is dumb, seed it deep inside the trunk\n\nYou must be drinking cum, 'cuz you talk a lot like a cunt\n\nGet punched and knocked out in the crosswalk right in the front\n\nYour resistance is food for my machismo\n\nWhen I push up on a fool, he's stuck on freeze mode\n\nThat ain't a full quip, riding on the Jean-Paul\n\nI ain't got no attitude, I just got a mean soul\n\nEverbody else telling me I needed to grow\n\nShut your pharmaceutical ass up, and put that weed in the bowl\n\nGot some cancer cells to kill, now the answer from hell\n\nSo pass the bill fast, 'cuz I over pressurize my master seal\n\nDon't over glamorize a man to kill\n\nDon't let 'em grow up, thinking he has to actually blast to steal\n\nAnd make sure they know there's more to life than just some rap skill\n\nIt's like decades later emcees get trapped still\n\n\n\nPower to the people\n\nDon't let a coward lead you\n\nCan't preach to you if they don't know how to feed you\n\nI burnt the haystack and found the needle\n\nThen proceed to, invest the water, cows, and diesel\n\nAnd sour diesel, wholesale banana trucks\n\nHotels in Panama, no dope sales, we're manning up\n\nUnplug the cord, debug the store\n\nWe love the lord, but keep getting drug into war\n\nWhat's the gun for? If all we're doing is talking\n\nWhat are you doing marching when all of these humans starving?\n\nThe diamond's like, shine a light, they got it right\n\nOr, we can set it off like dynamite\n\nThe balance is found, Los Angeles bound\n\nIn a van full of cannabis pounds\n\nWe came back to stick our flag in the ground\n\nIf you're down, put your damn hands to the clouds\n\n[?]\n\n\n\nYou gotta try now\n\nAin't no more [?]\n\nThis is what you\n\nYou gotta shout now\n\n[?]\n\nThis is what you want\n\n\n\nAs the sun sets, the moon rises with vengeance\n\nI ask you to witness what revenge is\n\nMoving mountains and inches\n\nThe business is resistance\n\nPowerful as we evolve\n\nGet involved, we can get it all\n\nAltogether we could get it solved\n\nBosses that'll pay the cost",
