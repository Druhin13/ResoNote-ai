  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Press It Up par Anders\r\nI give you that work\nUsed to break it down\nNow I press it up\nTurn into the plug\nI was out here trappin'\nEven with an open case\nFell in love with money\nAll I needed was a taste\nNow I get that work\nI don't break it down\nI just press it up\nTurn into the plug\nIf you ain't about business\nGet up out my way\nTake a look at where we came from\nAnd how far we came\n\n\nI get it from every angle\nShe do tricks just like Chris Angel\nDoin' tricks like acrobatics\nMoney turned into a savage\nI need a chain so big, it made my neck hurt\nDiamonds on me, I fell in love with the pressure\nBlowin' all your money, just tryna' impress her\nNow we countin' hundreds, call her a finesser\nYea, she a freak for a fucking fee\nFor the right price, she'll get on her knees\nFor the right price, she'll do any theme\nOh, yeah\n\nI give you that work\nUsed to break it down\nNow I press it up\nTurn into the plug\n\nI was out here trappin'\nEven with an open case\nFell in love with money\nAll I needed was a taste\nNow I get that work\nI don't break it down\nI just press it up\nTurn into the plug\nIf you ain't about business\nGet up out my way\nTake a look at where we came from\nAnd how far we came\n\nIf you don't like me, how you like me now?\nPaint it all on her face\nThat ain't no wifey now\nShe choosin' up\nBecause I hold it down\n\nWhy she always on her rag when you come around?\nI never fall and I don't panic\nI just pull up for that bag\nAnd once I get it, then I vanish\nPussy to me, only pussy I can get it when I want it\nRollin' up that marijuana, smoke it 'til I'm in a coma, yeah\nI'm never coughin' hit it then release\nDon't want my love, they just want a piece\nAnd when I'm eating, everybody eats\n\nI give you that work\nUsed to break it down\nNow I press it up\nTurnin to the plug\nI was out here trappin'\nEven with an open case\n\nFell in love with money\nAll I needed was a taste\nNow I get that work\nI don't break it down\nI just press it up\nTurn into the plug\nIf you ain't about business\nGet up out my way\nTake a look at where we came from\nAnd how far we came",
