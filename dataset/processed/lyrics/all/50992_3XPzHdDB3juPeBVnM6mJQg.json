  "lyrics": "I will not forgive, I will not forget\r\nI will not forgive, I will not forget\r\nMy heart it stops, it starts, once close now far apart\r\nI’m here, but I’m not, and I feel nothing, but incomplete\r\nThere’s nothing left to say, you threw it all away\n\nWe’ve drifted apart so lang ago, so faraway\n\n\n\nYou made me incomplete\n\nCause you’re the stranger inside of me\n\nAnd now I know, you are no missing piece\n\nCause you’re the stranger inside of me\n\nLove’s long gone\n\n\n\nI will not forgive, I will not forget\n\nI will not forgive, I will not forget\n\n\n\nYou know nothing, nothing of me\n\nNo matter what you think you see\n\nYou know nothing, nothing of me\n\nYou’ve opened my eyes and now I'm free\n\n\n\nYou know nothing, nothing of me\n\nYou know nothing, nothing of me\n\nYou make me sick\n\nYou make me sick\n\n\n\nMy heart it stops, it stars, once close now far apart\n\nI'm here, but I'm not and I feel nothing, but incomplete\n\n\n\nYou made me incomplete\n\n'Cause you're the stranger inside of me\n\nAnd now I know you are no missing peace\n\nCause you're the stranger inside of me\n\nLove's long gone\n\n\n\nI will not forgive, I will not forget",
