  "lyrics": "I could be as happy as a sardine in a can\r\nLong as I got my woman\r\nI could run stark naked and live in and old oak tree\r\nJust as long as she's with me\r\nMy woman.\n\nThe cannibals can catch me and fry me in a pan\n\nLong as I got my woman\n\nI could get the electric chair for a phony rap\n\nLong as she's sittin' in my lap\n\nMy woman.\n\n\n\nI'd run a mile, just to see her smile\n\nAnd put her lovin arms, around my neck\n\nAw heck\n\nMy spine starts a tingling, and bells start a ringling\n\nWhen she's with me, can't you see.\n\n\n\nThey could torture me and stretch me like a rubber band\n\nLong as I got my woman\n\nI could jump off a cliff and never have no fear\n\nJust as long as she is near\n\nMy woman.",
