  "lyrics": "I am what I create\r\nLashed by tongues of electric fire\r\nShimmering rivers crystalline\r\nRun though frozen glimpses in time\r\nAnd I just can't ignore this sight\n\nPouring down on me relentlessly\n\nI just can't ignore this feeling\n\nDeafened by rolling waves of realisation\n\nFrozen, mesmerised in the rain\n\n\n\nIn my darkest days\n\nI only saw the shades of grey\n\nIn a world that drips in colour\n\n\n\nDroplets of life form in freefall in convalescenece\n\nThey hammer into the soil\n\nCarving new streams of essence, through turmoil\n\n\n\nI am just as fluid, as immortal and lucid\n\nAs the Earth that morphs, in the violence of a thunderstorm\n\n\n\nMy life is what I make of my trials and mistakes\n\nMy life is what I make, I am what I create\n\n\n\nI am what I create\n\nI am what I create\n\nI am what I create\n\n\n\nIn my darkest days\n\nI only saw the shades of grey\n\nIn a world that drips in colour",
