  "lyrics": "When I go home alone\r\nI drive past the place where I was born\r\nAnd the places that I used to drink\r\nYoung and drunk and stumbling in the street\r\nOutside the Joiners Arms like foals unsteady on their feet\r\nWith the art students and the boys in bands\n\nHigh on E and holding hands with someone that I just met\n\n\n\nI thought \"it doesn't get\n\nBetter than this\n\nThere can be nothing better than this\n\nBetter than this\"\n\nAnd we climbed onto the roof, the museum\n\nAnd someone made love in the ground\n\nAnd I'd forgotten my name\n\nAnd the way back to my mother's house\n\nWith your black cool eyes and your bitten lips\n\nThe world is at your fingertips\n\nIt doesn't get better than this\n\nWhat else could be better than this?\n\n\n\nOh, don't you know I have seen\n\nI have seen the fields aflame\n\nAnd everything I ever did\n\nWas just another way to scream your name\n\n\n\nOver and over and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over and over again\n\n\n\nAnd we're just children wanting children of our own\n\nI wanted space to watch things grow\n\nBut did I dream too big?\n\nDo I have to let it go?\n\nWhat if one day there is no such thing as snow?\n\nOh God, what do I know?\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know anything\n\nExcept that green is so green\n\nAnd there's a special kind of sadness that seems to come with spring\n\n\n\nOh, don't you know I have seen\n\nI have seen the fields aflame\n\nAnd everything I ever did\n\nWas just another way to scream your name\n\n\n\nOver and over and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over and over again\n\n\n\nOh, don't you know that I have seen\n\nI have seen the fields aflame\n\nBut everything I ever did\n\nWas just another way to scream your name",
