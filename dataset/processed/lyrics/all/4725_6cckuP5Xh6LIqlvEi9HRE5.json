  "lyrics": "A bright blue sky is what I used to see but\r\nMy vision's been torn out to all that's been\r\nAnd I know it's not right and I've crossed the line but\r\nPlease understand that there was a time when\r\nI let my heart go just to watch it burn\n\nSo I told myself it's a lesson learned\n\nBut did I really learn?\n\n\n\nJealousy\n\nI guess you finally taking over me\n\nJealousy\n\nI'm suffering from your control\n\nAnd you're covering me like a basking coat\n\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\n\nJealousy\n\nOh can't you stay away from me?\n\n\n\nThe voices inside of my head\n\nKeep me wondering where we at\n\nLike a fire, it starts to spread\n\nCovering up my skin and flesh and\n\n\n\nI keep fighting\n\nBut the monster won't let me win, oh\n\nI keep fighting\n\nBut the monster won't let me win, oh\n\n\n\nJealousy\n\nI guess you finally taking over me\n\nJealousy\n\nI'm suffering from your control\n\nAnd you're covering me like a basking coat\n\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\n\nJealousy\n\nOh can't you stay away from me?\n\n\n\nI can't breathe\n\nI've lost my soul\n\nCause you've taken all\n\nI thought I'd know\n\n\n\nYou're covering me like a basking coat\n\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\n\nAnd you're covering me like a basking coat\n\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\n\n\n\nJealousy\n\nI guess you finally taking over me\n\nJealousy\n\nI'm suffering from your control\n\nAnd you're covering me like a basking coat\n\nGetting harder to breathe under your control\n\nJealousy\n\nOh can't you stay away from me?",
