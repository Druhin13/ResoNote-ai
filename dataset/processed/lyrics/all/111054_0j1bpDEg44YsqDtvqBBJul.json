  "lyrics": "Lost my valentine\r\nYou could never keep my meaning straight\r\nAnd I won't wait in line\r\nFor you to give me any time of day\r\nI want a revolution\n\nYou want a short solution\n\nWe never could see eye to eye\n\nYou wanted retribution\n\nI came to the same conclusion\n\nIt's a story as old as time\n\nI heard you crying in the other room\n\n\n\nTried to test the ice\n\nBut I could hear it cracking underneath\n\nThere's no compromise\n\nIf both of us are aching to be free\n\n\n\nI want a revolution\n\nYou want a short solution\n\nWe never could see eye to eye\n\nYou wanted retribution\n\nI came to the same conclusion\n\nIt's a story as old as time\n\nI heard you crying in the other room\n\n\n\nIt took a lifetime\n\nFor us to see that it's too late\n\nWe're a broken stake\n\n\n\nAnd after all of this\n\nWe keep ignoring the signs\n\nThe waters run dry\n\n\n\nI want a revolution\n\nYou want a short solution\n\nWe never could see eye to eye\n\nYou wanted retribution\n\nI came to the same conclusion\n\nIt's a story as old as time\n\nI heard you crying in the other room",
