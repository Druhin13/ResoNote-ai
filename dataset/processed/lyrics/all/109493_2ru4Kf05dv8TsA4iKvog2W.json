  "lyrics": "One more wasted morning\r\nWhen I could be holding you\r\nTo my side somebody stop this joyless joy ride\r\nI'm feeling older than my thirty-five years\r\nOne more cryptic message\n\nThinking that I might end it\n\nOh god, you must have woken up\n\nTo me saying that it's all too much\n\nI'll take it easy with the morbid stuff\n\n\n\nHoney I'm worried 'bout you\n\nYou're too much to lose\n\nYou're all that I have\n\nAnd, honey I'm worried 'bout you\n\nPut yourself in my shoes\n\nYou're all that I have so please don't die\n\nWherever you are tonight\n\n\n\nAll these pointless benders\n\nWith reptilian strangers\n\nOh my god you're so naive\n\nYou leave this world in a drunken heap\n\nWho'll make the arrangements, baby, them or me?\n\n\n\nHoney I'm worried 'bout you\n\nYou're too much to lose\n\nYou're all that I have\n\nAnd, honey I'm worried 'bout you\n\nPut yourself in my shoes\n\nYou're all that I have\n\nYou're all that I have\n\nYou're all that I have\n\nSo please don't die\n\nWherever you are tonight",
