  "lyrics": "Coffee burns, the stomach churns\r\nChemicals and caffeine\r\nYou saw her bathing in the creek\r\nNow you’re jealous of the water\r\nNow you’re jealous of the water\n\nNow babe, if it’s alright I call you that\n\nI’ve been running solo, but it ain’t all that\n\nThey say it’s the take and give\n\nBut emptiness knows just where I live\n\nAnd emptiness knows me\n\n\n\nWas it just chemicals in my head\n\nWas it just chemicals in my head\n\n\n\nTell me why all these pages are flying round in the yard\n\nHow my hands can’t seem to find your hands in the dark\n\nTell me, tell me how the hell did we get all the way up here\n\nHow gravity’s gone\n\nGravity’s gone\n\nHow gravity’s gone",
