  "lyrics": "Let forever take me in. Now I know that I’m alive\r\nGive me something to forgive, as the wicked come to life\r\nShow me where it all begins, as I watch this world divide\r\nHope will guide you to the end and there will be no last goodbye\r\nFor all live and die. Leave it all behind\n\nTake away the dark inside and lead me to the light\n\nAll will fade before your eyes as we turn the tide\n\nI will bring the dream to life. Hold on. Just hold on\n\nI will keep you here inside. Just close your eyes\n\n\n\nTake the rebel from within. Now I know that I’ll survive\n\nShow me how to play pretend as I watch this world collide\n\nFate will guide you to the end and there will be no hope to hide\n\nFor all live and die. Leave it all behind\n\n\n\nTake away the dark inside. Lead me to the light\n\nAll will fade before your eyes as we turn the tide\n\nI will bring the dream to life. Hold on. Just hold on\n\nI will keep you here inside. Just close your eyes\n\n\n\nLeave it all behind\n\nTake away the dark inside. Lead me to the light\n\nAll will fade before your eyes as we turn the tide\n\nI will bring the dream to life. Hold on. Just hold on\n\nI will keep you here inside. Hold on. Just hold on\n\nI will keep you here inside. Just close your eyes",
