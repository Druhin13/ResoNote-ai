  "lyrics": "Nothing to say, to be honest\r\nGot no idea what to talk about now\r\nSpeaking my mind is so useless\r\nCan't think of words that suit the stale I'm in\r\nDon't know at all what it's all about\r\nAll day long I'm smoking\n\nAlways a thrill butI'm not getting high\n\nI'm not excited\n\nI don't feel like it\n\nDeterioration\n\nI've got a cracked brain, cracked brain\n\nFeel too lazy to get up\n\nJust stay in bed and rest my mind\n\nNowhere to go - no one's waiting\n\nAll I want is to get passed this day\n\nStare at a box with moving pictures\n\nLie on a rug and let the time pass by\n\nClouds of smoke inside my bedroom\n\nFloating away and leave reality behind\n\nI'm not excited...",
