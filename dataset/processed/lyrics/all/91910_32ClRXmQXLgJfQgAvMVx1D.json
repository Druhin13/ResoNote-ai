They don't notice\n\nWhat is she to the problem?\n\nWhat's the truth when she's ballin'?\n\nGold, silver, platinum\n\n\n\nIf she had some extra change\n\nShe would pass it out like candy canes\n\nSpread the energy, double-A (Double-A)\n\nIf she had some extra feet\n\nShe would stroll into clarity\n\nDonate the shoes to charity (Charity)\n\n\n\nI just wanna be ballin'\n\nNew crew, drop top, just flossin'\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\nWant the drip drip to the ice, drip to the pink lips\n\nDrip drip, shiny drip drop, can't you see it? (It)\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond? (Diamond, diamond)\n\n\n\nWhen I move outta here, man\n\nI'ma build my own kingdom\n\nTurn it out on the weekends\n\nI would buy a golden stage\n\nChill that shit out like the ice age\n\nYeah, those spotlights on my face (On my face)\n\nAnd have a pool fulla Kool-Aid (Kool-Aid)\n\nAnd a bounce house like the good days\n\n'Cause every day would be my birthday (Birthday)\n\n\n\nI just wanna be ballin'\n\nNew crew, drop top, just flossin' (Just flossin')\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\nWant the drip drip to the ice, drip to the pink lips\n\nDrip drip, shiny drip drop, can't you see it? (It)\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond? (Diamond, diamond)\n\nI just wanna be ballin' (Ballin')\n\nNew crew, drop top, just flossin' (Shot callin')\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\nWant the drip drip to the ice, drip to the pink lips\n\nDrip drip, shiny drip drop, can't you see it? (It)\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\n\n\nI've been broke and that shit ain't funny\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\nI've been botch with no water running\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\nFilling up with the rice and honey\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\nReaching out for this dream to bite me\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\n\n\nI just wanna be ballin' (Ballin')\n\nNew crew, drop top, just flossin' (Flossin')\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\n\n\nI just wanna be ballin' (Ballin')\n\nNew crew, drop top, just flossin' (Shot callin')\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)\n\nWant the drip drip to the ice, drip to the pink lips (Ooh yeah)\n\nDrip drip, shiny drip drop, can't you see it? (Oh, yeah)\n\nWhat's a dollar to a diamond?\n\n(Just wait 'til I get some money)",
