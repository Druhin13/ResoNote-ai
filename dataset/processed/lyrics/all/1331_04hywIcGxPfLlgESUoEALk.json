  "lyrics": "Don't come with your arms swinging\r\nThrow them around me\r\nSome kind of sweet relief\r\nI hope you never leave\r\nIt's all the same to me\n\nJust bring yourself\n\nYou know your presence is present enough\n\nI got a front row seat\n\nIt's all the same to me\n\nI spend a lot of my time\n\nDoing a whole lot of nothing\n\n\n\nI know you're doing your best\n\nI think you're doing just fine\n\n\n\nI know it's been a long week\n\nAnd now you're taking your time\n\nSome kindness goes around\n\nSome kind of backfires\n\n\n\nIt's all the same to me\n\nIgnore that voice\n\nIt puts you down\n\nYou make your choice, I'm here for you\n\nIt's all the same to me\n\nI got a lot on my mind\n\nBut I don't know how to say it\n\n\n\nI know you're doing your best\n\nI think you're doing just fine\n\n\n\nKeep on keeping on\n\nYou know you're not alone\n\nAnd I know all your stories\n\nBut I'll listen to them again\n\n'Cause if you move away\n\nYou know I'll miss your face\n\nIt's all the same to me\n\nYou know it's all the same to me\n\nKeep on keeping on\n\nYou know you're not alone\n\nAnd I know all your stories\n\nBut I'll listen to them again\n\nAnd if you move away\n\nYou know I'll miss your face\n\nIt's all the same to me\n\nYou know it's all the same to me\n\nKeep on keeping on\n\nYou know you're not alone\n\nAnd I know all your stories\n\nBut I'll listen to them again\n\nAnd if you move away\n\nYou know I'll miss your face\n\nIt's all the same to me\n\nYou know it's all the same to me",
