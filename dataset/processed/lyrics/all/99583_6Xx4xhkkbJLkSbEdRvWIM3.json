  "lyrics": "Well, my heart's a runaway\r\nLiving by the camp fire light\r\nYeah, my love's a stowaway\r\nSlipping out into the night\r\nBut hey, I can feel it\n\nI don't want to run this time\n\nI can feel it now\n\nHey, I can feel it\n\nShining like the sun this time\n\nI know now\n\nI don't want to run away\n\nI don't want to run away\n\n\n\nWell, my soul's a cast away\n\nTired of bein' alone\n\nYeah, my love gets thrown away\n\nAny way the wind gets blown, oh\n\n\n\nBut hey, I can feel it\n\nI don't want to stray this time\n\nI can feel it now\n\nHey, I can feel it\n\nPulling down like rain this time\n\nI know now\n\nI don't want to\n\n\n\nThe runaway trains never get no peace\n\nThey keep on running till their engines seize\n\nKeep on running and I don't stand still\n\nI won't know love, no, I never will\n\nAnd rolling stones never find a home\n\n'Cause they keep on rolling through life alone\n\nIf I keep on rolling down the same old hill\n\nI'll never know love, I never will\n\n\n\nI can feel it\n\nI don't want to search no more\n\nI can feel it now\n\nHey, I can feel it\n\nIt's never felt so good before\n\nI know now\n\nI don't want to run away, ay\n\nI don't want to run away, hey\n\nI don't want to run away, yeah\n\nI don't want to run away",
