  "lyrics": "Can't go back to the beginning\r\nCan't control what tomorrow will bring\r\nBut I know here in the middle\r\nIs the place where you promise to be\r\nI'm not enough unless you come\n\nWill you meet me here again\n\nCause all I want is all you are\n\nWill you meet me here again\n\n2x\n\n\n\nAs I walk now through the valley\n\nLet your love rise above every fear\n\nLike the sun shaping the shadow\n\nIn my weakness your glory appears\n\n\n\nI'm not enough unless you come\n\nWill you meet me here again\n\nCause all I want is all you are\n\nWill you meet me here again\n\n\n\nNot for a minute\n\nWas I forsaken\n\nThe Lord is in this place\n\nThe Lord is in this place\n\n\n\nCome Holy Spirit\n\nDry bones awaken\n\nThe Lord is in this place\n\nThe Lord is in this place",
