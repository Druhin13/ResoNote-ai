  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Angie par Shame\r\nWell there she swings\nBefore the banshee\nHer skirt does sing\nThe notes of Angie\nI'm not a man\nBut that’s ok\nCause my baby swings\nFrom night till day\n\nHer skirt was silk\nHer skin was stained\nIn all my dreams\nShe still remains\nShe lies untouched\nInnocent and pure\nMy only hope\n\nMy only cure\n\nI’ll let my flesh wear thin\nHave my hair fade and fall\nJust so once more\nI can feel your skin\nConfined in soil walls\nFor this life it serves no purpose\nWithout your sweet embrace\nAnd now no angels roam this land\nYou’ll never be replaced\n\nI'll see you soon\nUp where you lie\nUnder the moon\nAbove the sky\nScratch me away\nOut of your skin\n\nStill to this day\nI hear your skirt sing\n\nI took her down\nAnd there she lay\nHer face stained brown\nNo notes to play\nWell there she swings\nBefore the banshee\nHer skirt does sing\nThe notes of Angie\nFrom night till day\nFrom night till day\nMy baby swings\nFrom night till day\n\nI'll see you soon\nUp where you lie\n\nUnder the moon\nAbove the sky\nScratch me away\nOut of your skin\nStill to this day\nI hear your skirt sing\n\nWell I know you could do better\nAnd I know you could do worse\nBuild a latex box to drown in\nAnd bathe in the absurd\nDeep fry your feelings so they can't escape\nDisappear into nothing\nAnd find your happy place\nFind your happy place\n\nI'll cut you down\nI'll hold your face\n\nAnd we will stay\nIn your happy place\nIn your happy place",
