  "lyrics": "I let the bats out, we walked through\r\nThe cathedral out in to the moon\r\nYour flashback is airtight\r\nLike an elephant never hurt a fly\r\nMother instinct, never gonna die\n\nAlright, stay, you got my attention\n\nAll my pain is bottled affection\n\n\n\nNow it's my turn to play cool\n\nNothing you can say can even break through\n\nI see the weapons, I pulled out\n\nI met my match, so why am I proud?\n\n\n\nI'm not the same kid, I grew up\n\nDidn't I? Or did I get stuck?\n\nYou get older, it gets worse\n\nYou be the good one that gives it up first\n\nOr the bad one that never gets hurt\n\n\n\nAlright, stay, you got my attention\n\nAll my pain is bottled affection\n\nAlright, stay, you got my attention\n\nAll my pain is bottled affection\n\n\n\nMy affection, my affection\n\nPouring out, pouring out\n\nMy affection, my affection\n\nPouring out, pouring out\n\nMy affection, my affection",
