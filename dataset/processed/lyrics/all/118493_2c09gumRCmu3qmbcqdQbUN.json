  "lyrics": "I gotta get that bag\r\nIt's a thug life, it's a thug life\r\nI gotta get that bag (sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)\r\nIt's a thug life (la-da-da-da)\r\nIt's a thug life (it's a, oh-uh-oh)\r\nOoh-ah (Sha-na-na-na-na-na-sha-ah)\n\nLa-da-da-da (It's a— oh-uh-oh)\n\nOoh-ah\n\n\n\nTry to treat man like baby\n\nFeel the teeth sink in like rabies\n\nBoy you know you don't look fly\n\nDem gold chains turn your neck green, bye\n\n\n\nIt's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know that I possessed\n\nI sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept\n\nI understand what I neglect in times when I obsess\n\nI’m learning to confess\n\nThis fate is harder to digest\n\nThe biggest threat I’m up against\n\nIs who I face in my reflection\n\nDepression still an uninvited guest\n\nI'm always accepting\n\nCan’t help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace\n\nWhen I know that it’ll kill me\n\nIf I give into my brain\n\nI see the shadows inside\n\nThey ten feet tall with no eyes\n\nThey put my head in the water\n\nAnd there it’s so beautiful under\n\nThe sun reflecting off the corals colors I can’t describe\n\nTo make the darkness divine\n\n\n\nShouldn't have been out of sight\n\nLa-da-da-da\n\nIt's a, oh-uh-oh\n\nOoh-ah\n\nShouldn't have been out of sight\n\nLa-da-da-da\n\nIt's a, oh-uh-oh\n\nOoh-ah\n\nShouldn't have been out of sight",
