  "lyrics": "Look, lets get this show on the highway\r\nNo time to play, I've been up like fire escapes\r\nLate night writing like poets, in fine space\r\nI'm feelin' like a hero all I need is a fire cape and I'm straight\r\nThen you can call me Mr. Emperor the greatest kid\r\nThen shredding competition like G's when they're grates\n\nThe one that they say is rude till' they see him in his face\n\nAnd notice that his intentions pure as the 9th grade\n\nI need a Mother Theresa to be my new babe\n\nI be father [?] as we lead new slaves\n\nI walk Earth, reading the signs like new waves\n\nI used hurt building inside to make raves\n\nLike the legion that I placed em' in, when I'm goin' ten\n\nI got em shocked, like tasers and surprising a friend\n\nIf you feel you got a problem don't watch and pretend\n\nBecause I got it on lock like I'm tryna defend\n\nCause I ain't never been the kind to depend\n\nI could [?]\n\nIt goes down like when politics ends\n\nThat ink lines help me travel time again and again\n\nLike twisters, had to spin in the position I was in\n\nNow everybodys' kid, and who would see vividly\n\nFuck it, I know its because I'm gettin' in the industry\n\nSo I don't let it get to me, I see it all differently\n\nCould never let it set a nigga back like [?]\n\nDouble XL, ready yeah these tee's\n\nLike the senior in the Freshman classes getting D's\n\nStill I've been tryna be breathtaking like a wheeze\n\nI can see, I'm boutta blow like it finna be a breeze\n\nPeace!",
