  "lyrics": "Back before these calloused hands and all this work\r\nWe used to sit up at the flats\r\nActin' like we'd live forever\r\nGettin' high and skippin' class\r\nYeah, I reckon we were heathens\n\nBut in her eyes we were saints\n\nNow you're callin' all the boys home\n\n'Cause heaven's angels carried her away\n\n\n\nSo I will follow you to Virgie\n\nAlthough it hurts me so\n\nTo lay to rest this mountain beauty\n\nThat the Lord's called home\n\nI can see her up in glory\n\nI can see her through the pines\n\n\n\nBack when all us boys were tryin'\n\nTo make sense of all these streams\n\nI can see her in the corner\n\nSingin' along to all our crazy dreams\n\n\n\nAnd I will follow you to Virgie\n\nAlthough it hurts me so\n\nTo lay to rest this mountain beauty\n\nThat the Lord's called home\n\nI can see her up in glory\n\nI can see her through the pines\n\n\n\nI will follow you to Virgie\n\n'Cause that's what us boys are for\n\nTo help you out when you get weary\n\nAnd you can't go no more\n\n\n\nAnd can't you see her up there, Cody\n\nI can see her through the pines\n\nSayin' \"Boys be good\"",
