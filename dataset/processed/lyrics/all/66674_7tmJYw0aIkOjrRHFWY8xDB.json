  "lyrics": "She and her shadow walked side by side\r\nNot talking as she brushed the fringe from her eyes\r\nToo dark to see her\r\nOr anything so they held hands\r\nThey walked until they both were lost\n\nAsked for directions but could not stop\n\nEach step synchronised\n\nTwo figures in disguise\n\n\n\nI don't know about you\n\nAnd you don't know about me\n\nBut I can see right through\n\nAll the things that we could be\n\nI don't know about you\n\nAnd you don't know about me\n\nBut I can see right through\n\nAll the things that we could be\n\n\n\nYou can take what you want from me\n\nYou can take almost everything\n\nCause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\nThe shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\nYou can take what you want from me\n\nYou can take almost everything\n\nCause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\nThe shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\n\n\nFeeling this he admired the girls face\n\nAs she started to smile and he started to fall for her\n\nTripping down the cliff into a dark deep daze\n\nShe didn't notice but blushed anyways\n\n\n\nI don't know about you\n\nAnd you don't know about me\n\nBut I can see right through\n\nAll the things that we could be\n\nI don't know about you\n\nAnd you don't know about me\n\nBut I can see right through\n\nAll the things that we could be\n\n\n\nYou can take what you want from me\n\nYou can take almost everything\n\nCause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\nThe shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\nYou can take what you want from me\n\nYou can take almost everything\n\nCause the shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\nThe shadow, the shadow, the shadows next to me\n\n\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\nShe fell for the shadow\n\n\n\nThey stood there together with nothing said\n\nBalancing closely so close to the edge\n\nAnd looked to their feet, suddenly a part of this life\n\nAnd felt on top of the world",
