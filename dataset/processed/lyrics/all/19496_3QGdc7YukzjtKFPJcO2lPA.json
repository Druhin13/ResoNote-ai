  "lyrics": "The last spoken will of a warrior King:\r\n\"Bury me next to my soldiers\r\nSet my horse free and let people sing\r\nOf their son with the world on his shoulders\r\nThen look to the mountains\r\nI left my grave wide open.\"\n\nEyes fixed on the mountain\n\n\"I was buried at dusk, at dawn I return.\"\n\n\n\nHere it comes\n\nDeath undone\n\nKing after King\n\n\n\nFrom this tomb we shall build you a throne\n\nIn your name we shall sing\n\nLight your torch, let the flames lead you home\n\nLong live the King!\n\n\n\nThe heart of a King can be measured in dreams\n\nReaching the sleep of his people\n\nA whisper of ghost saying we'll be redeemed\n\nFrom our sins he will build us a castle\n\nOne day we'll be stronger, we will ride right beside you\n\nUntil we are stronger, we put stone upon stone\n\nAwait your return\n\n\n\nFrom this tomb we shall build you a throne\n\nIn your name we shall sing\n\nLight your torch, let the flames lead you home\n\nLong live the King!\n\n\n\nThe longing for sun and a heartbreak undone\n\nBreaking the back of false idols\n\nBring our King home, for among us are none\n\nWho is worthy to be his disciple\n\nOut there in the wasteland, there's something coming for us\n\nA call from the wasteland:\n\nHe was buried at dusk, at dawn he returns\n\n\n\nHere it comes\n\nDeath undone\n\nKing after King\n\n\n\nFrom this tomb we shall build you a throne\n\nIn your name we shall sing\n\nLight your torch, let the flames lead you home\n\nLong live the King!\n\n\n\n(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh!)",
