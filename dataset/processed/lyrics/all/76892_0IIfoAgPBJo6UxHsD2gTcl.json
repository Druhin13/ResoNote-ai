  "lyrics": "Where I come from isn't all that great\r\nMy automobile is a piece of crap\r\nMy fashion sense is a little whack\r\nAnd my friends are just as screwy as me\r\nI didn't go to boarding schools\n\nPreppy girls never looked at me\n\nWhy should they I ain't nobody\n\nGot nothing in my pocket\n\n\n\nBeverly Hills - That's where I want to be! (Gimme Gimme)\n\nLiving in Beverly Hills...\n\nBeverly Hills - Rolling like a celebrity! (Gimme Gimme)\n\nLiving in Beverly Hills...\n\n\n\nLook at all those movie stars\n\nThey're all so beautiful and clean\n\nWhen the housemaids scrub the floors \n\nThey get the spaces in between\n\n\n\nI wanna live a life like that\n\nI wanna be just like a king\n\nTake my picture by the pool \n\nCause I'm the next big thing!\n\n\n\nBeverly Hills - That's where I want to be! (Gimme Gimme)\n\nLiving in Beverly Hills...\n\nBeverly Hills - Rolling like a celebrity! (Gimme Gimme)\n\nLiving in Beverly Hills...\n\n\n\nThe truth is...I don't stand a chance\n\nIts something that you're born into...\n\nAnd I just don't belong...\n\n\n\nNo I don't - I'm just a no class, beat down fool\n\nAnd I will always be that way\n\nI might as well enjoy my life\n\nAnd watch the stars play\n\n\n\nBeverly Hills - That's where I want to be! (Gimme Gimme)\n\nLiving in Beverly Hills...\n\nBeverly Hills - Rolling like a celebrity! (Gimme Gimme)\n\nLiving in Beverly Hills...",
