  "lyrics": "Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness\r\nIt took me years to understand that this too, was a gift\r\nIt took me years to realize you teared my heart through fordable mires\r\nBut I wasn't made for shallow waters, my heart is an ocean...\r\nAnd I think that's where I am right now: floating, drifting away\n\nToo weak to continue swimming, yet not weak enough to give up and sink\n\nLeastwise I know now, that salty waters might cure everything\n\nShedding tears... or to walk into the sea...\n\n\n\nDid you know, if you hold your breath all too long\n\nYou will finally sleep forever?\n\nDid you know, that I never forgave myself\n\nFor what we've become?\n\nHow odd I can have all of this inside me\n\nAnd to you it's just words, another letter?\n\nBut what is loss? What is wealth?\n\nI am nothing! We are nothing...!\n\n\n\nWe are nothing...!\n\n\n\nI am the mourning\n\nYou are the scars\n\nI am the night\n\nColor me black\n\nI am the mourning\n\nYou are the scars\n\nI am the night\n\nColor me black\n\n\n\nThere's a place in my heart that will never be filled\n\nAnd even during the best and the greatest times\n\nI will know it... more than ever\n\nI will know it... more than ever\n\n\n\nIn another night, in another world\n\nThings could have been so different\n\nIn another night, in another world\n\nThings would have been so different\n\n\n\nI am the mourning\n\nYou are the scars\n\nI am the night\n\nColor me black\n\nI am the mourning\n\nYou are the scars\n\nI am the night\n\nColor me black",
