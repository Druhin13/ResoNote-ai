  "lyrics": "Our greatest gift is not our knowledge or critical thought\r\nNot all primal urges are natural instincts\r\nHumanity's greatest gift is connection\r\nThey've chosen to separate us by our differences rather than acknowledge that we have always been one\r\nIs there not wisdom in being wicked or wickedness in being wise?\r\nWithout wisdom, we lose sight of another soul\n\nWithout wickedness, the soul dies\n\nLight and darkness never compete\n\nThey only balance\n\nThe united exists somewhere in between\n\nWe are wise and we are wicked\n\nWe have joined something great\n\nWe are descendants of [?]\n\nWe speak with poethic fluidity and move with passionate release\n\nWe share our resources, putting a stop to mindless servitude\n\nWe do not hide from justice or discovery\n\nWe welcome rebellion and we rebel in expression\n\nEmbrancing a single side of humanity will never lead to real success or progression\n\nFaith requires our collection to take that which makes us wise\n\nAnd wicked\n\n\n\nAnd stand together\n\nUnited",
