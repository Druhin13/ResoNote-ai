  "lyrics": "A potion like madness in season\r\nBracing all like a breaking of reason\r\nWith every night lost and every day torn\r\nWith the drama feeling calmer and it's calmer in the storm\r\nSpeakers are crying like a forrest in the rain\r\nI was so alone with my thoughts and my pain\n\nAnd the darkness closed like a mouth on a wild night\n\nI'll never be free\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nI can't stand on my own anymore\n\nI can't stand in the stain of the broken and poor\n\nI can't break what I held and it never was true\n\nIn the mirror what I said was I lied to you\n\nAnd me and everything I see and everything I could\n\nTried so hard to be good\n\nFor myself, for you, for the hidden and divine\n\nFor everything but I can fail just so many times\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nI can't stand on my own anymore\n\nI can't stand in the stain of the broken and poor\n\nI can't break what I held and it never was true\n\nIn the mirror what I said was I lied to you\n\nAnd me and everything I see and everything I could\n\nTried so hard to be good\n\nFor myself, for you, for the hidden and divine\n\nFor everything but I can fail just so many times\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\nOooh\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way\n\n\n\nOoh, in this darkness\n\nPlease light my way\n\nLight my way",
