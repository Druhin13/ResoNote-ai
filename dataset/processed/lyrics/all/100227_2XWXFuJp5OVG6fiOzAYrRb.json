  "lyrics": "In the blue light\r\nOf the belvedere Motel\r\nWondering as the television burns\r\nHow the heart approaches what it yearns\r\nIn a fever\n\nI distinctly hear your voice\n\nEmerging from a dream, the dream returns\n\nHow the heart approaches what it yearns\n\n\n\nAfter the rain on the Interstate\n\nThe headlights slide past the moon\n\nA bone-weary traveler\n\nWaits by the side of the road\n\nWhere's he goin?\n\n\n\nI dream we are lying on the top of a hill\n\nAnd headlights slide past the moon\n\nI fold in your arms\n\nAnd your voice is the heat of the night\n\nI'm on fire\n\n\n\nIn a phone booth\n\nIn some local bar and grill\n\nRehearsing what I'll say, my coin returns\n\nHow the heart approaches what it yearns\n\nHow the heart approaches what it yearns",
