  "lyrics": "I found a love for me\r\nOh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead\r\nWell, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet\r\nOh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me\r\n'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love\r\nNot knowing what it was\n\nI will not give you up this time\n\nBut darling, just take it slow, your heart is all I own\n\nAnd in your eyes, you're holding mine\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms\n\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song\n\nWhen you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath\n\nBut you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight\n\n\n\nWell I found the one, stronger than anyone I know\n\nShe shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home\n\nI found a love, to carry more than just my secrets\n\nTo carry love, to carry stories of our own\n\nWe are still kids, but we're so in love\n\nFighting against all odds\n\nI know we'll be alright this time\n\nDarling, just hold my hand\n\nBe my girl, I'll be the one\n\nI see my future in your eyes\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\n\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\n\nI have faith in what I see\n\nNow I know I have met an angel in person\n\nAnd she looks perfect\n\nI don't deserve it\n\nYou look perfect tonight",
