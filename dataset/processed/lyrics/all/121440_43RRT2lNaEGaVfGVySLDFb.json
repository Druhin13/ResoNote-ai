  "lyrics": "I saw you standing there\r\nSandy blonde hair, the way it came tumbling down\r\nJust like a waterfall\r\nAnd if you need a light\r\nI'll be the match to your candle, my darling, I'm ready\r\nTo burst into flames for you\n\n\n\nI was just coasting 'til we met\n\nYou remind me just how good it can get\n\n\n\nWell I've been on fire, dreaming of you\n\nTell me you don't, it feels like you do\n\nLooking like that, you'll open some wounds\n\nHow does it start and when does it end?\n\nOnly been here for a moment, but I know I want you\n\nBut is it too soon?\n\nTo know that I'm with you\n\nThere's nothing I can do\n\n\n\nAnd sometime around one\n\nWe fell asleep to escape from the sun\n\nAnd we woke up to the sound of a storm outside\n\nWe stood at your front door\n\nYou looked at me and said \"Baby, this rain changes everything\"\n\nAnd my heart ran away from me\n\n\n\nI was just coasting 'til we met\n\nYou remind me just how good it can get\n\n\n\nWell I've been on fire, dreaming of you\n\nTell me you don't, it feels like you do\n\nOpening up can open some wounds\n\nHow does it start and when does it end?\n\nOnly been here for a moment, but I know I want you\n\nDarling, I do\n\nI'm with you\n\nThere's nothing I won't do\n\nTo see you shine\n\nI'll swing for the fences, I'll run to the line\n\nAnd it's high time that you love me\n\n'Cause you do it so well\n\nTo see you shine\n\nI'll swing for the fences, I'll run to the line\n\nAnd it's high, high time\n\n\n\nOh darling, I'm with you\n\nOh darling, I'm with you\n\nThere's nothing I won't do\n\nThere's nothing I won't do\n\nI'm with you\n\nOh darling, I'm with you",
