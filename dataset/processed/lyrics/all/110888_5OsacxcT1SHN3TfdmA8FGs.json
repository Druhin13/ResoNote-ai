  "lyrics": "This could be the biggest mistake we make in this life\r\nChasing as we tried to compete for each other's time\r\nFrom the world we locked ourselves inside, in a place to keep us safe from all to see\r\nThey can't hide you from me\r\nThank your lucky stars that we can call this ours\n\nWe've had some bad ideas yet we're still here in this life worth dreaming\n\nI can be your heart, be your soul, just don't let me off easy, don't you let me go\n\nThank your lucky stars that we can call this ours\n\n\n\nA lovely mess we find ourselves in, we brave it so bold\n\nQuietly, we dance through the heat, your hand as I hold\n\nBut their warnings left us no concerns as we swallow the truth whole, unoriginal\n\nWe're losing control\n\n\n\nThank your lucky stars that we can call this ours\n\nWe've had some bad ideas yet we're still here in this life worth dreaming of\n\nI can be your heart, be your soul, just don't let me off easy, don't you let me go\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\n\n\nRemember all the ghosts that you left them with\n\nRemember all the ghosts that you left them with\n\nRemember all the ghosts that you left them with\n\nDon't give 'em up, don't give 'em up, don't give 'em up\n\n\n\nThank your lucky stars that we can call this ours\n\nWe've had some bad ideas yet we're still here in this life worth dreaming\n\nI can be your heart, be your soul, just don't let me off easy, don't you let me go\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\n\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars\n\nThank your lucky stars",
