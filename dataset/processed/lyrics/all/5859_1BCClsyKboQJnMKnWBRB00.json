  "lyrics": "When I lay you down, I could see you fall in\r\nYou allowed, I saw, are we going again\r\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\r\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\n\nAre you holding on to something ain't real\n\nSo relax, let go, and let it all feel\n\n\n\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\n\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\n\n\n\nHe said, how does that feel when you open wide\n\nShe said, what do you see when you look inside\n\n\n\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\n\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\n\n\n\nLet it go, I see it flow away in all directions\n\nNever fear, the light you shine around in all reflections\n\n\n\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you\n\nSo come back to the middle, come back to the middle of you",
