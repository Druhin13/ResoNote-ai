  "lyrics": "Girl, perfectly her, broken and hurt\r\nSoft and asleep in the morning gray\r\nShake off the night and don't hide your face\r\nThe sun lights the world with a single flame\r\nI want you to see this\r\nI want you to see this\n\n\n\nToday and all of your days, I'll wear your pain\n\nHeal what I can in your troubled mind\n\nSometimes our bodies will hurt for some time\n\nAnd the beauty in that can be hard to find\n\nI want you to find it\n\n\n\nI want you to see this\n\nI want you to see this\n\n\n\nSo run, wake up and run, my little one\n\nI wanna tear down these walls that can't hold you inside\n\nAnd rip out the cords and uncover your eyes\n\nWe'll make our escape in the dark of night\n\nI need you to see this\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nGirl, you'll see the world\n\nAnd you'll come to learn\n\nThat falling in love is a strange work of art\n\nAll of your battles will shape who you are\n\nAnd know that your scars are my favorite part\n\nI want you to know this",
