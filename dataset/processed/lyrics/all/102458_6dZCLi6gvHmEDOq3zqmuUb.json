  "lyrics": "I know what she's like, she's out of her mind\r\nAnd wraps herself around the truth\r\nShe'll jump on that flight and meet you that night\r\nAnd make you tear up the room\r\nShe loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\n\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming for you\n\n\n\nShe'll dance in the dark, a real work of art\n\nHer eyes could burn down the room\n\nSo get out while you can, you don't understand\n\nShe doesn't know how to lose\n\n\n\nShe loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\n\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming for you\n\n\n\nShe'll run with your mind and pull you in tight\n\nThen trade you in for something new\n\nI know what it's like, I fell for it twice\n\nAnd now I'm just warning you\n\n\n\nShe loves when everybody's watching\n\nShe knows the way her body moves\n\nShe loves the way they all crawl back when she says\n\nThat she loves nobody else but you\n\n\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's coming, she's coming for you\n\nShe's on the loose\n\nShe's on the loose",
