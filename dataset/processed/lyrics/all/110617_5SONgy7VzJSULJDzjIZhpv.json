  "lyrics": "(Featuring Martin Johnson of Boys Like Girls)\r\nThere is a light\r\nComing from the clouds\r\nI want to see further \nThan they'll allow\n\n\n\nGo to bed now \n\nThey'll be here soon\n\nTo bring us all presents\n\nIf we were good\n\n\n\nAnd take me where we need to go to find a little snow\n\nOut where the fire logs will need a little spark to grow\n\nAnd tell me to close me eyes to quickly fall asleep before you know shows\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\nAnd take me where we need to go to find a little snow\n\nOut where the fire logs will need a little spark to grow\n\nAnd tell me to close me eyes to quickly fall asleep before you know shows\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\n\n\nThere is a light\n\nStill coming from the clouds\n\nI want it to be here\n\nI want it right now\n\n\n\nOh cause I'm sick of the cold\n\nAnd waiting for tomorrow\n\nAnd I've been waiting all year, all year\n\nSwear I was good\n\n\n\n(oh)\n\n\n\nTake me where we need to go to find a little snow\n\nOut where the fire logs will need a little spark to grow\n\nAnd tell me to close me eyes to quickly fall asleep before you know shows\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\nAnd take me where we need to go to find a little snow\n\nOut where the fire logs will need a little spark to grow\n\nAnd tell me to close me eyes to quickly fall asleep before you know shows\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\n\n\nAnd take me where we need to go to find a little snow\n\nOut where the fire logs will need a little spark to grow\n\nAnd tell me to close me eyes to quickly fall asleep before you know shows\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\nAnd take me where we need to go to find a little snow\n\nOut where the fire logs will need a little spark to grow\n\nAnd tell me to close me eyes to quickly fall asleep before you know shows\n\nHe'll be here soon\n\nHe'll be here soon",
