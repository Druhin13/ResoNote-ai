  "lyrics": "So much noise, can't block it out\r\nI don't wanna scream and shout\r\nBecause I talk and talk, but no one hears a word\r\nThey twist me 'round and pull me back and forth\r\nI go crazy, spinnin' my wheels around\r\nSometimes, you gotta stop and\n\n\n\nLet the record play, let the record play\n\nWe can cut the lights, do you feel it now?\n\nIt's taken over and gettin' loud\n\nLet the record play, let the record play\n\nThere's nothin' more to talk about\n\nSo close your eyes and let it out, yeah\n\n\n\nNow just for once, some time to breathe\n\nTo clear my head and clear the screen\n\nCause all I wanna do is find some release\n\nTo break away and live in peace\n\nI go crazy, spinnin' my wheels around\n\nSometimes, you gotta stop and\n\n\n\nLet the record play, let the record play\n\nWe can cut the lights, do you feel it now?\n\nIt's taken over and gettin' loud\n\nLet the record play, let the record play\n\nThere's nothin' more to talk about\n\nSo close your eyes and let it out, yeah\n\n\n\nSometimes, you gotta stop\n\nSometimes, you gotta stop\n\n\n\nLet the record play, let the record play\n\nWe can cut the lights, do you feel it now?\n\nIt's taken over and gettin' loud\n\nLet the record play, let the record play\n\nThere's nothin' more to talk about\n\nSo close your eyes and let it out\n\nLet the record play, let the record play, yeah",
