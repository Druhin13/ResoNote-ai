  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Hold On par Lane 8\r\nNow I want a reason why\nYour word is worth more\nAnd strange that you won't abide\n\nWhen I have so nobly\nTurn round, face all you won't\nYou're caught in the surface,ì\nYou're distant, remote.ì\n\nAnd I can wait until you're done\nUntil you come down\nRelease you from\nOn the surface, your sense of calm\nBut a little later\nYou won't be what you were\n\n\nI want a reason why\nI worked so hard\nI want a reason why\nI wonder, I wonder why\nI want a reason why\nTell me what to do\n\nHold on\nHold on\nHold on\nHold on\nHold on\n\nAnd I can wait until you're done\nUntil you come down\nRelease you from\nOn the surface, your sense of calm\nBut a little later\n\nYou won't be what you were\n\nHold on\nHold on\nHold on\nHold on\nHold on",
