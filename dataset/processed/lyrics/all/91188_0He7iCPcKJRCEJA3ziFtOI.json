  "lyrics": "Well I got my life together\r\nEverything's right in place\r\nSo why do I feel like I'm losin' it\r\nEvery time I see your face\r\nI got 24 hours in my day\n\nI got 7 days in my week\n\nI got time for work, time for play\n\nAnd a little time left to sleep\n\nBut I got no time for love\n\nNo mind for love\n\nI'm way too busy makin' plans\n\nI got no time for love\n\nOh yeah\n\n\n\nThe way you walked right into my life\n\nAnd tried to win me with your kiss\n\nBut I got places to go and things to do\n\nAnd your kiss ain't on my list\n\nI got no time for love\n\nNo mind to for love\n\nI'm way too busy makin' plans\n\nI got no time for love\n\n\n\nOh, no time for love\n\nI got no mind for love\n\nI'm way too busy makin' plans\n\nI got no time for love",
