  "lyrics": "Spot a little hottie when I flipped out the shades\r\nLookin' like a red Rari sittin' in a driveway\r\nBottle of CÃ®roc with a hint of Kool-Aid\r\nShe done pulled up like I'm getting rid of weeds\r\nAre you tired from running through my mind\r\nTake a break and we can have a good time\n\nShow you moves like I'm the new James Brown\n\nMe and you should get a room right now\n\n\n\n'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away, you're worth more than every single chain\n\nIt ain't gonn' work if you don't want it too, best drink I take is when I sippin' you\n\n\n\nYou know where I go when we're dancing\n\nHandshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you\n\nAnd you look so classy, come through with that magic\n\nYou know that I'm bout to smash it, it's true\n\n\n\nI can take you to the room, I can take you to the beach\n\nBut we gotta leave at 9 'cause I gotta get my sleep\n\nYou can be that early bird, Imma get that worm\n\nYou and me, I'll take 'round the world\n\n\n\n'Cause if it's gold, I'll throw it away, you're worth more than every single chain\n\nWalk with a limp, it just means I'm cool, next trip I take is just me and you\n\n\n\nYou know where I go when we're dancing\n\nHandshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you\n\nAnd you look so classy, come through with that magic\n\nYou know that I'm bout to smash it, it's true\n\n\n\nLil Boat\n\nYou said you lovin' up north when you comin' to the A\n\nYou said you need to find a crib, well, tell me where you wanna stay\n\nI know we're not too pressed for time but can you pick up on the pace\n\nI'm tired of looking at your pictures, wanna be up in your face\n\nI wanna dance with you, I wanna laugh I wanna sing\n\nTake you on the road, have you rockin' on my bling\n\nDon't know if you're the one but if you are, you'll get a ring\n\nThat's later down the line, don't wanna rush these types of things\n\nI'm a mama's boy so you gotta meet my mama first\n\nAs you whip the Coupe around, use the seat belt first\n\nNew shoes, new clothes and a Chanel purse\n\nVacaying in The Hamptons got a lazy curse\n\n\n\nYou know where I go when we're dancing\n\nHandshakes in The Hamptons and gettin' drunk in the mansions with you\n\nAnd you look so classy, come through with that magic\n\nYou know that I'm bout to smash it, it's true",
