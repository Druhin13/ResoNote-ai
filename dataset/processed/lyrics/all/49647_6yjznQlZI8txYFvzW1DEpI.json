  "lyrics": "Now the walls have gone silent\r\nThe rooms are missing all your mess\r\nAnd the staircase you painted\r\nHas left a trail of quiet steps\r\nSlow down, handle with care\n\nThis love that we share\n\nLife is a difficult test\n\nAnd our love is blessed\n\n\n\nAnd we will find our way\n\nMaybe not today\n\nJust remember you haven't seen\n\nThe best of me\n\n\n\nYou left the curtains wide open\n\nThey're leaving in the winter light\n\nI see a garden that's calling\n\nFor you to bring it back to life\n\n\n\nSlow down, think it over again\n\nThis can't be the end\n\nYou are my better part\n\nAnd love of my life, my friend\n\n\n\nAnd we will find our way, yeah\n\nMaybe not today\n\nJust remember that you haven't seen\n\nThe best of me\n\n\n\nMy heart was made for loving someone like you, yeah\n\nMy tears were made for crying over someone like you\n\n\n\nAnd we will find an easy way\n\nMaybe not today\n\nJust remember you haven't seen\n\nThe best of me",
