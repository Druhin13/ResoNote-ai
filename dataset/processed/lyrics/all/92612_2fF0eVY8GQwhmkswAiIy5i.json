  "lyrics": "Your black hair is red\r\nI laughed when I saw your chest\r\nYou shook your head and pulled the curtains back, took in the view\r\nThen you showed me the rest of you\r\nAnd then I guess I thought I'd see the world\r\nI guess I thought I would see the world\n\n\n\nYour black heart is big\n\nI'd ask you to cross but you'd never do it\n\nBut then again you stopped in the middle of the street\n\nJust to kiss me, I thought you'd stopped the world\n\nI guess I thought you could stop the world\n\n\n\nAlright, alright for now\n\nDon't wanna think about it\n\nI'm fine with hiding out\n\nAlright, alright for now\n\nI'll wrap my head around it\n\nMake room for something else\n\nAlright, alright for now\n\nDon't wanna think about it\n\nI'm fine with hiding out\n\nAlright, alright for now\n\nI'll wrap my head around it\n\nMake room for something else\n\n'Til then I'll hold it down",
