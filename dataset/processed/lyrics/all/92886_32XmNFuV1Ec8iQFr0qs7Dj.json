  "lyrics": "I met the Devil down in Austin\r\nHe gave me a Fuji apple\r\nI took a bite and went out of my head\r\nI was a girl in a black Corvette\r\nGetting head in the shadows\r\nI was a beetle floating in a bottle of red\n\n\n\nI was a party clown\n\nParty clown\n\n\n\nI took a weightless bath\n\n'Til my own laugh gave me the creeps\n\nI watched a scorpion crawl across my feet\n\nIt’s been a while, but we communicate psychically\n\nNow you're at my door, trick or treat\n\n\n\nI'm a party clown\n\nParty clown\n\nI’m a party clown\n\nParty clown\n\n\n\nAnd why can't you be my puzzle piece, baby\n\nAnd now that you've cracked me open wide, to see\n\nThat I was living my life in stencil\n\nBut the rainbow was inside of me\n\n\n\nParty clown\n\nParty clown\n\nI'm a party clown\n\nParty clown\n\n\n\nCan you be my puzzle piece, baby?\n\nWhen I cry like Meryl Streep?\n\nAnd when I crack my head wide open\n\nI wanna be next to you\n\n\n\nI'm a party clown\n\nParty clown\n\nI'm a party clown\n\nParty clown\n\nParty clown",
