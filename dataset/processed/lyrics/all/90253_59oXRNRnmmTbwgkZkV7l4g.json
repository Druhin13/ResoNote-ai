  "lyrics": "Something's going on with me\r\nI'm not who I used to be, nah\r\nReached point where darkness is my comfort zone\r\nI know it's not what you came here for\r\nSo fly like an eagle\n\nGo be beautiful and free girl\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm better off on my own\n\nGo save your soul\n\nYou don't wanna go where I go\n\nI'm just a low down rolling stone\n\nBarely hanging on\n\n\n\nI'm just a low down rolling stone\n\nI'm barely hanging on\n\n\n\nPlease help me ease my mind\n\nPlease help me ease my mind\n\n\n\nTemptation's got a hold of me\n\nI'm not where I'm s'posed to be\n\nYou're only here for the thrill, it's not where you belong\n\nI know I'm no one you can depend on\n\n\n\nSo fly like an eagle\n\nGo be beautiful and free girl\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm better off on my own\n\nGo save your soul\n\nYou don't wanna go where I go\n\nI'm just a low down rolling stone\n\nI'm better off on my own\n\nGo save your soul\n\nYou don't wanna go where I go\n\nI'm just a low down rolling stone\n\nBarely hanging on\n\n\n\nHere you come, bringin' your flowers again\n\nThere you go, in the clouds again\n\nThere you go, making rounds again\n\n\n\nAnd I'm only gonna bring you down\n\n\n\nSo I'm better off on my own\n\nGo save your soul\n\nYou don't wanna go where I go\n\nI'm just a low down rolling stone\n\n\n\nYou don't wanna go where I go baby, no",
