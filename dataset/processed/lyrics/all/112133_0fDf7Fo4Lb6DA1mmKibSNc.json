  "lyrics": "Wondering where to begin\r\nLoneliness rises again\r\nAll I knew isn't right for me now\r\nOh, I've nowhere to turn\r\nHeaven isn't holding my hand\n\nHoping I can make it to the end\n\nI wasn't looking for a phantom or a friend\n\nTryna find an answer in the wind\n\nI keep feeling like I'm rushing to the end\n\nLooking for a good place to begin\n\nBut will I ever know I'll never know\n\n\n\nAll I want is enough to believe\n\nBut they said there was no guarantee\n\nAll I knew is you're here for me now\n\nI look up at the stars\n\n\n\nBut heaven isn't holding my hand\n\nHoping I can make it to the end\n\nFeeling like I'm living in my head\n\nI wasn't looking for a phantom or a friend\n\nI keep feeling like I'm rushing to the end\n\nTryna find a good place to begin\n\nI keep hoping for an answer in the wind\n\nI wasn't looking for a phantom or a friend\n\nBut will I ever know I'll never know\n\nTryna find a good place to begin\n\nBut will I ever know I'll never know",
