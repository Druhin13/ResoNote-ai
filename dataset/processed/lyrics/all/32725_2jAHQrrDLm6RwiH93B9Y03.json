  "lyrics": "I dreamt of you\r\nThe last two nights\r\nAnd we made love\r\nLike our past lives\r\nFelt good to see \nYour face again\n\nAnd feel your sun\n\nUnder my skin\n\nWe kissed goodbye in Brooklyn light\n\nThen things got darker after that night\n\nI know I tainted what we had\n\nHow could something so good end so bad\n\nDon't get it twisted I'm not asking for forgiveness\n\nI'm just saying I would do things a little different\n\n\n\nAnd now\n\n\n\nIt’s too late to say I’m sorry\n\nToo messed up to say I love you\n\nWe’ve moved on years passed but\n\nSometimes I miss us\n\nIt’s too late to say I’m sorry\n\nToo messed up to say I love you\n\nWe’ve moved on years passed but\n\nSometimes I miss us\n\n\n\nAnd you saw all I would be, I would be, I would be, I would be\n\nI would be, I would be, I would be, I would be\n\n\n\nI'd love to sit down\n\nAnd clear things up up\n\nMaybe talk about music\n\nThat could be enough\n\nBut what would that do\n\nFor you now \n\nCause you got a wife\n\nAnd a child\n\nDon't get it twisted I'm not asking for forgiveness\n\nI'm just saying I would do things a little different\n\n\n\nAnd now\n\n\n\nIt’s too late to say I’m sorry\n\nToo messed up to say I love you\n\nWe’ve moved on years passed but\n\nSometimes I miss us\n\nIt’s too late to say I’m sorry\n\nToo messed up to say I love you\n\nWe’ve moved on years passed but\n\nSometimes I miss us\n\n\n\nAnd you saw all I would be, I would be, I would be, I would be\n\nI would be, I would be, I would be, I would be\n\n\n\n\n\nMight have been the one\n\nNow you’re someone else\n\nKnow that you told me\n\nNo one would love me\n\nOr treat me the way you do\n\nI refused to believe you\n\nStrangers on my pillow\n\nAnd I’m thinking of you\n\nStill thinking of you\n\n\n\nAnd now it’s\n\n\n\nIt’s too late to say I’m sorry\n\nToo messed up to say I love you\n\nWe’ve moved on years passed but\n\nSometimes I miss us\n\nIt’s too late to say I’m sorry\n\nToo messed up to say I love you\n\nWe’ve moved on years passed but\n\nSometimes I miss us\n\n\n\nI miss us",
