  "lyrics": "Uncertainty on demand\r\nCurrently it's an emergency\r\nAnd we need disaster relief\r\nAnd finally consolation prizes, today\r\nSeeking solace in shadows\n\nEclipsing binary stars\n\nDancing in a graveyard of ambition\n\nResurrecting everybody's desires and visions\n\n\n\nEverything is falling apart\n\nAnd we all have confessions to make\n\nAnd all the things that you've ever loved\n\nEffectively will never be spoken of again\n\n\n\nWe are powerful enough to perfect\n\nAn apparatus of incredible accuracy\n\nSo this could be our final embrace\n\nLosing face through a veil of ash and smoke\n\n\n\nAnd I don't want this\n\nNo one wants this anymore\n\n\n\nGrow another habit",
