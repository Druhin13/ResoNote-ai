  "lyrics": "From the time I was born\r\nThrough all of my days\r\nTry to catch my breath\r\nOut of the womb and into the flames\r\nSearching for the neon path\r\nI've been waiting my whole life\n\nIn the crossfire, yeah\n\nI've been hiding my whole life\n\nIn the crossfire, yeah the crossfire\n\n\n\nEvery time I move\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEverywhere I look\n\nIt's right in front of my face\n\nOne foot in the shadows\n\nOne foot on the brakes\n\nOne foot towards the gallows\n\nWhere it's quiet and safe\n\n\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nStep that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\n\n\nLost in the motions\n\nLocked in the safe\n\nTrying to forget the key\n\nAnd I know where I lost it\n\nBut I'll never say\n\nOne day it was taken from me\n\nI've been waiting my whole life\n\nIn the crossfire, yeah\n\nI've been hiding my whole life\n\nIn the crossfire, yeah the crossfire\n\n\n\nEvery time I move\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEverywhere I look\n\nIt's right in front of my face\n\nOne foot in the shadows\n\nOne foot on the brakes\n\nOne foot towards the gallows\n\nWhere it's quiet and safe\n\n\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nStep that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nStep that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\n\n\nEvery time I move\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEverywhere I look\n\nIt's right in front of my face\n\nOne foot in the shadows\n\nOne foot on the brakes\n\nCan't shake this force that\n\nKeeps calling my name\n\n\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take\n\nEvery step that I take",
