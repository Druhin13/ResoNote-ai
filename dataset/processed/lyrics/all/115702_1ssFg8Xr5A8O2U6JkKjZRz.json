  "lyrics": "PJs with fuzzy socks\r\nUgly sweaters with polka dots\r\nWarm cookies, had my fill\r\nI might have gained a pound or two to help with the chill\r\nHot cocoa, piping hot\r\nSnuggled up in our favorite spot\n\nWhisper things we shouldn't say\n\nAnd I don't plan on leaving here til Christmas Day\n\n\n\nWindows frosted\n\nSummer's sleeping\n\nBut I don't really mind\n\n\n\nI know that it's cold outside\n\nThe world is bundled up in white\n\nI just need you by my side\n\n'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you\n\n\n\nLast year I was on my own\n\nHibernating in my empty home\n\nSanta didn't even help\n\nI left a plate of cookies\n\nBut I ate them myself\n\nThis year feels so brand new\n\nTie a ribbon around me and you\n\nSanta is checking twice\n\nHe's trying to figure out if we're naughty or nice\n\n\n\nRoads are closed\n\nSnow is falling\n\nBut I don't really mind\n\n\n\nI know that it's cold outside\n\nThe world is bundled up in white\n\nI just need you by my side\n\n'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you\n\n\n\nI know that it's cold outside\n\nThe world is bundled up in white\n\nI just need you by my side\n\n'Cause I'm warmer in the winter with you\n\nThe temperature is toasty for two\n\nI'm warmer in the winter with you",
