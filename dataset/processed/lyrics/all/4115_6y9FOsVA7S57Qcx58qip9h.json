  "lyrics": "For now you love me while my face is young and body's strong\r\nBut one tomorrow they won't be there when tomorrow comes\r\nDo you think that you'll love me even when the lovin' hurts?\r\nYou're captivated by a beauty that I didn't earn\r\nI've been trying to believe it\n\nMan, I mean it when I say that it is only worth it if it's real enough to trust\n\nI know that it is only worth it if it's pure devotion\n\n\n\nI would never ask for you to stay\n\nWon't expect you to come with me\n\nIf you wanted to go a different way\n\nThen I'd give you whatever you need\n\n\n\nFor now you love me but I don't know how you say you're sure\n\nYou understand that it's forever that you're asking for\n\nI've done enough to know when I should learn from old mistakes\n\nAnd fought enough to know how quickly what I do can fade\n\n\n\nI've been trying to believe it\n\nMan, I mean it when I say that it is only worth it if it's real enough to trust\n\nI know that it is only worth it if it's pure devotion\n\n\n\nI would never ask for you to stay\n\nWon't expect you to come with me\n\nIf you wanted to go a different way\n\nThen I'll give you whatever you need\n\n\n\nTell me anything, just not a lie\n\nI won't try to control this\n\nI mean it when I tell you it's not worth it unless it's pure devotion",
