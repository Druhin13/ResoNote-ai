  "lyrics": "And what do we see here\r\nWashing up on the beach in November\r\nWhen nobody lives here\r\nBecause they've all left this beach town\r\nFor the winter\r\nTables and bed frames\n\nA complete set of tarnished silver\n\nPhotographs with no names\n\nMore items are left with every crash of the grey waves\n\nI collect it all over the course of four days\n\nFour days\n\n\n\nFour days alone\n\nHiding in a yellow beach house\n\nFull of beetles and stones\n\nAnd a silence that's freaking me out\n\nI broke the phone\n\nI didn't mean to but I broke it\n\n\n\nThe waves sigh and moan\n\nI sit on the porch and I hope it\n\nDon't start to rain again\n\nI feel muscle pain again\n\nI wait for the main event\n\n\n\nWhich is your voice on the phone to me\n\nSaying the operation went smoothly\n\nAnd they still can't kill us, hopefully\n\nAnd you're in the car on the road to me\n\nWith your brand new body",
