  "lyrics": "One part anger\r\nTwo parts heartbreak\r\nThree parts relief\r\nI'm escaping this reality we made\r\nFour parts fear\r\nI've made a terrible mistake but\n\nOnly a fool would stay\n\n\n\nGot what I paid for\n\nI was chasing the muse\n\nYou're gonna get what you paid for\n\nIt's time you walked away from me\n\nIt's time to choose\n\nHow to be\n\nAnd what to do\n\nHow are you gonna be?\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nI hope you figure it out\n\n\n\nSo put the record\n\nPut the record on its needle\n\nGo on and turn the TV down\n\nAnd try to listen\n\nI will listen if I'm able\n\nWhat was that song about\n\n\n\n'Cause how much longer were we carrying on\n\nHow many more times would we carry you home\n\nThe bar was closing down\n\nYou were stumbling out\n\nSleepwalking drunk\n\nAnd I only mirrored the pain\n\n\n\nGot what I paid for\n\nI was chasing the muse\n\nYou're gonna get what you paid for\n\nIt's time you walked away from me\n\nIt's time to choose\n\nHow to be\n\nAnd what to do\n\nHow are you gonna be?\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nI hope you figure it out\n\n\n\nSo put the record\n\nPut the record on its needle\n\nGo on and turn the TV down\n\nAnd try to listen\n\nI will listen if I'm able\n\nWhat was that song about\n\n\n\n\n\nGot what I paid for\n\nI was chasing the muse\n\nYou're gonna get what you paid for\n\nIt's time you walked away from me\n\nIt's time to choose\n\nHow to be\n\nAnd what to do\n\nHow are you gonna be?\n\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\nI hope you figure it out\n\n\n\nI hope you figure it out\n\n'Cause how much longer were we carrying on?\n\nI hope you'll figure it out\n\nHow many more times would we carry you home?\n\nYou're gonna figure it out\n\nHow much longer were we carrying on?\n\nYou're gonna figure it out\n\nHow many more times, let love carry you home?",
