  "lyrics": "Seventeen, you don't think that much about life\r\nYou just live it\r\nLike Kerosene dancing around a fire\r\nBut you're in it\r\nSo you jump right in\n\nAin't afraid to fall\n\nAnd you give it all\n\n\n\nShe got the best of me\n\nShe broke my heart\n\nNow all that's left of me\n\nIs beating in this guitar\n\nEvery night, a different town\n\nShe follows me around\n\nSo you get what's left of me\n\nShe got the best of me\n\n\n\nI picked myself up off the floor\n\nAnd found something new worth living for\n\nAnd a, old dusty hand-me-down six string\n\nAnd a couple chords\n\n\n\nI'm getting over her\n\nA little more with every song\n\nSo sing a-long\n\n\n\nShe got the best of me\n\nShe broke my heart\n\nNow all that's left of me\n\nIs beating in this guitar\n\nEvery night, a different sound\n\nShe follows me around\n\nSo you get what's left of me\n\nShe got the best of me\n\n\n\nShe got the best of me\n\nShe got the best of me\n\nShe got the best of me",
