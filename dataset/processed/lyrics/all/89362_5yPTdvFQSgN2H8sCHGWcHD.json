  "lyrics": "Did the bull crush me or do I still give a fuck?\r\nIs my heart ripped out or just shriveled up?\r\nAdd water and it's back like a brine shrimp\r\nRob, pimp, fuck, steal, murder, limp by, scrimp\r\nWelcome to your life, kid, rock bottom shithole\r\nGrab a shovel, dig down, try to hit coal\n\nSanta's in the North Pole doing fentanyl\n\nNo more good little boys so he meant to kill himself\n\nBut he couldn't find a vein with the hot steel\n\nHe couldn't find himself at all, bitch, he's not real\n\n\n\nDoes it feel fucked up?\n\nDoes it feel fucked up?\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy\n\nDoes it feel fucked up?\n\nDoes it feel fucked up?\n\n\n\nI'd be real dumb if I seem super\n\nEvery day we're diggin' out our souls with an ice cream scooper\n\nVisine might clean our tears\n\nBut I fear you'd be worse off if your sight's clear\n\nDon't like the view here, all my pyros\n\nGo fill your eye droppers up with some nitro'\n\n'Glycerin, discipline, steady with the hand\n\nWanna have your mind blown, ready for a bang?\n\nEyes wide open, let me know what you hear\n\nMight be a slight ringin' in your ears\n\n\n\nIt's check-in time, how does it feel? (How does it feel?)\n\nHow does it feel? (How does it feel?)\n\nHow does it feel? (Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?)\n\nFeels alright\n\nFeels alright\n\nFeels alright\n\n\n\nPretty nice, huh?\n\nWe can go on for days like that",
