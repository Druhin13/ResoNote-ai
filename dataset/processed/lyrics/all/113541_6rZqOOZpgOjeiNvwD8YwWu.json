  "lyrics": "Chestnuts roasting on an open fire\r\nJack Frost nipping at your nose\r\nYuletide carols being sung by the choir\r\nFolks dressed up like ?\r\nEverybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe\n\nHelps to make the season bright\n\nTiny tots with their eyes all aglow\n\nWill find it hard to sleep tonight\n\n\n\nThey know that Santa Claus is on his way\n\nHe's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh\n\nAnd every mother's child is gonna spy \n\nTo see if reindeer really know how to fly\n\nAnd so I'm offering this simple phrase\n\nTo kids from 1 to 92\n\nAlthough it's been said many times many ways\n\nMerry Christmas to you\n\n\n\nOh, and so I'm offering this simple phrase\n\nTo kids from 1 to 92\n\nAnd although it's been said many times many ways\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nMerry Christmas\n\nMerry Christmas to you\n\n\n\n(Whispers) Merry Christmas",
