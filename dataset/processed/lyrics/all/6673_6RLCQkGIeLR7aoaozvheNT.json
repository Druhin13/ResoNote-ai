  "lyrics": "Each and every breath we take\r\nA step towards death\r\nAnd the moon is pale\r\nAnd we might have seen something\r\nBut we ain't seen nothing yet\n\nAnd I may have dreamt it\n\nOr it may have happened\n\nWhen I stood right here\n\nWaiting for a sign\n\nFor me to walk away\n\n\n\nBut I give in so easy\n\nAnd I give up instantly\n\nI chase what is gone\n\nAnd my friends are gettin' tired\n\nOf the shit that I pull\n\n\n\nThey say \"Why do you love those\n\nWho turn you into a fool?\n\nWhy do you let them get to you?\n\nYou should have been running\n\nWhen you chose to stay\"\n\n\n\nNow I feel so far away\n\nFrom the person I once was\n\nThough our love wasn't love\n\nYou can tell yourself so many things\n\nAnd nothing has to be true\n\n\n\nDid you wake up last night\n\nDrenched in your old sweat and tears\n\nNo, it's not always easy\n\nYou get lost countin' the years\n\nSince you last felt like you were home\n\nSince you last felt like you were home\n\nSince you last felt like you were home\n\nOh, I thought you were home",
