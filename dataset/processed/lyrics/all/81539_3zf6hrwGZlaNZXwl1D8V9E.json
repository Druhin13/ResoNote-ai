  "lyrics": "A whisper away from changin' everything\r\nBut is it safe to say\r\nSuch dangerous things\r\nWhen your hands are tremblin'\r\nGirl I'm weak in the knees\n\nIt's times like these when silence means everything\n\nMore than anything\n\n\n\nSo fall when you're ready baby\n\nLet our kiss count the moments and hearts set the pace\n\nAnd I'll be your love song \n\nand I'll love you right off your feet\n\nUntil you fall into me\n\n\n\nLove ain't a race\n\nThere's no finish line\n\nAnd I love a chase\n\nBut don't leave me behind\n\n\n\n'Cause girl we're both gamblin'\n\nBut I'm playin' for keeps\n\nIt's times like these\n\nWhen patience means everything\n\nMore than anything\n\n\n\nSo fall when you're ready baby\n\nLet our kiss count the moments and hearts set the pace\n\nAnd I'll be your love song \n\nand I'll love you right off your feet\n\n\n\nAnd I'll fall for you every day\n\nI'll cherish the moments time can't erase\n\nWe'll be the love song\n\nI promise you we're gonna sing\n\n\n\nGirl when you fall into me\n\nGirl when you fall into me\n\n\n\nC'mon baby fall into me\n\nI'm waiting\n\nFall into me\n\nFall into me\n\nFall into me\n\nA whisper away from changing everything",
