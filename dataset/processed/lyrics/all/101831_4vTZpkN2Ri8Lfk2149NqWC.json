  "lyrics": "Try to see it my way, \nDo I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? \nWhile you see it your way, \nRun the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone. \nWe can work it out, \nWe can work it out. \n\nThink of what you're saying. \n\nYou can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright. \n\nThink of what I'm saying, \n\nWe can work it out and get it straight, or say good night. \n\nWe can work it out, \n\nWe can work it out. \n\nLife is very short, and there's no time \n\nFor fussing and fighting, my friend. \n\nI have always thought that it's a crime, \n\nSo I will ask you once again. \n\nTry to see it my way, \n\nOnly time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. \n\nWhile you see it your way \n\nThere's a chance that we may fall apart before too long. \n\nWe can work it out, \n\nWe can work it out. \n\nLife is very short, and there's no time \n\nFor fussing and fighting, my friend. \n\nI have always thought that it's a crime, \n\nSo I will ask you once again. \n\nTry to see it my way, \n\nOnly time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. \n\nWhile you see it your way \n\nThere's a chance that we may fall apart before too long. \n\nWe can work it out, \n\nWe can work it out.",
