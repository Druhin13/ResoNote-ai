  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Right Hand 2 God par Nipsey Hussle\r\nI put my right hand to God, shine on these broads\nStay on my job, grind with my squad\nHundred racks on my car, no license at all\nNo tint on that thing, nigga, 'cause that's how we ball\nAll these fuck niggas' flawed, suckas and frauds\nMy circle so small, stick to my script and just ball\nFirst, I pick up my bitch, and we shut down the mall\nHad to pick up the tip, she tried to pay for it all\nBring some Yac' with my plate, garlic noodles and steak\nBouncin' out the valet, with all these tats' on my face\n\nPeople looking like, \"Hey! Black nigga' stay in your place\"\nBut it's some shit they 'gon think, and it's some shit they 'gon say\nGot to a brick from an eighth, see that music's my fate\nSwitched it out from out my trunk, went to the top of my state\nAnd I Versace'd my waist, like 2Pac in his hey\nBryan Williams, how I built this All Money Estate, whoa!\n\nI put my right hand to God\nI put my right hand to God\n\nPut my right hand to Jesus, fly like a eagle\nFight with these demons, shine light on my people\nThis life is a free throw, success is a kilo\n\nMy wife is a C-note, but my mistress is Creole\nI sip on that Clicquot, while I'm bangin' that Z-Ro\nGhetto nigga' like Cheeto's, that got more famous than Cee-Lo\nTurn legit from illegal, just like Pesci in Casino\nGet [J-s?] off a P-ro, watch him blow up like C-4\nI rose from a Regal, Auroras and Lincoln's\nLow-pros on Alpina's, to German drop top two-seaters\nWas young and prestigious, phone was matchin' my beeper\n\"How the fuck you 'gon reach him?\", he makin' more than his teachers\nMovin' forward with speed, all your morals'll leave\nOnly focus is cheese, now the forest is trees\n\nGot infected with greed, distort what you see\nYour worst nightmare than me, is justifyin' your means\nHold up!\n\nI put my right hand to God\nI put my right hand to God",
