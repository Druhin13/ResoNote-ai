  "lyrics": "Could I trust you with my thoughts\r\nOr would you use them all against me\r\nCan you replace my eyes for yours\r\nAnd see what I really look like\r\nI could help you criticize\n\nLooking for a sense of relation\n\nWhere do people want me to be?\n\nI can't help but die on vacation\n\nDressed to unimpress easily\n\nLosing sight again\n\nI'll go ahead and give your eyes back now\n\n\n\nYou go on, go on\n\nSo what's the point of connecting to anyone?\n\nIs a relationship bought or is it won?\n\n\n\nAre the things I think are important\n\nSimply just distractions from death?\n\nAll of my ideas turn to content\n\nThey can be conceived 'til they're read\n\nLost my words again\n\nIt doesn't matter\n\n'Cause you wouldn't understand\n\n\n\nLove, it isn't life in the twenties\n\nNothing much to look forward to\n\nI can't help but die on vacation\n\nIs this the way to exit my youth?\n\nOh\n\nHey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?\n\nHey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?",
