  "lyrics": "I know that I’m a mess, do things that I regret\r\nCan’t help that I can’t help myself\r\nYou’ll never understand, it’s hard to have one man\r\nSo just for now I’ll wish you well\r\n‘Cause I ain’t looking, right now ain’t looking for love\r\nBut I might be feeling, some kinda way tomorrow\n\nTonight I’m doing, all of the things that I want\n\nI better be going, but if you want tomorrow\n\n\n\nYou can take me out, pour some wine and rub my shoulders\n\nBut I don’t want you now I’ll come back when I’m hungover\n\nSo I’ll, be yours when the night is over\n\nI, only love you when I’m sober\n\n\n\nCan tell you’re into this, and that sometimes you wish\n\nThat you could have me all to yourself\n\nYou don’t know where I’ve been, ’cause I just came and went\n\nI’m not the type to kiss and tell\n\n\n\n‘Cause I ain’t looking, right now ain’t looking for love\n\nBut I might be feeling, some kinda way tomorrow\n\nTonight I’m doing, all of the things that I want\n\nI better be going, but if you want tomorrow\n\n\n\nYou can take me out, pour some wine and rub my shoulders\n\nBut I don’t want you now I’ll come back when I’m hungover\n\nSo I’ll, be yours when the night is over\n\nI, only love you when I’m sober\n\n\n\nYou can take me out, pour some wine and rub my shoulders\n\nBut I don’t want you now I’ll come back when I’m hungover\n\nSo I’ll, be yours when the night is over\n\nI, only love you when I’m sober\n\n\n\nOnly love you when I’m sober",
