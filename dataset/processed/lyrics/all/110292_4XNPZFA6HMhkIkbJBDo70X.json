  "lyrics": "How can I love you when you don't talk to me?\r\nWell, how can I breathe with no air?\r\nWell, I can only see what's in front of me\r\nBut what's there is more than what I thought, baby\r\nWell, in the evening sky\n\nI cast my eye with you on my mind\n\nAnd if the stars could speak\n\nThey'd tell me to sleep to see you in my dreams\n\nWell, in the evening sky\n\nI cast my eye, it's a beautiful view\n\nWell, I'm lost again with thoughts of you\n\n\n\nIf only life had more colors I could see\n\nWell, life would be balanced\n\nIt's hard to conceive it\n\nWell, it don't matter\n\nThere's a window this evening\n\nFar and wide\n\nYou keep texting me\n\n\n\nWhen we're feeling good, everything's okay\n\nAnd when we're feeling down, there ain't nothing to say\n\n\n\nWell, in the evening sky\n\nI cast my eye with you on my mind\n\nAnd if the stars could speak\n\nThey'd tell me to sleep to see you in my dreams\n\nWell, in the evening sky\n\nI cast my eye, it's a beautiful view\n\nWell, I'm lost again with thoughts of you\n\n\n\nIf there's reality\n\nPatience please be kind to me\n\nTreat me like you know nothing\n\nAs if ain't no history\n\nYou can see the pain, see thing from words I speak\n\nAnd I take it very seriously\n\n\n\nWell, in the evening sky\n\nI cast my eye with you on my mind\n\nAnd if the stars could speak\n\nThey'd tell me to sleep to see you in my dreams\n\nWell, in the evening sky\n\nI cast my eye, it's a beautiful view\n\nWell, I'm lost again with thoughts of you\n\n\n\nThoughts of you, thoughts of you\n\nOn my mind, on my mind\n\nThoughts of you, thoughts of you\n\nOn my mind, on my mind\n\nThoughts of you, thoughts of you\n\nOn my mind, on my mind\n\nThoughts of you, thoughts of you\n\nOn my mind, on my mind",
