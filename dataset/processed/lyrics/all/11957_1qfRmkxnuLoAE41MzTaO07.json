  "lyrics": "I don't know the cunts you used to hang around with\r\nI don't care for their names or what they did\r\nI just see you floating like a deity in a dress\r\nAre you looking for me? Are you looking for me?\r\n'Cause you don't have to change\n\nYou are not a little fish\n\nYou don't have to swim upstream to find their praise\n\n\n\n'Cause I love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\n\n\nThere's no romance in this shit facility\n\nTired arms reach out at swinging branches\n\nI see phonies in their room for improvement\n\nAre you looking for me? Are you looking for me?\n\n\n\n'Cause you don't have to change\n\nYou are not a little fish\n\nYou don't have to swim upstream to find their praise\n\n\n\n'Cause I love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\n\n\n\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are\n\nI love you exactly how you are",
