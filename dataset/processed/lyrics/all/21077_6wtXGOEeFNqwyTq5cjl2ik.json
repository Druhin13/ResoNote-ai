  "lyrics": "Since I'm inside this prison\r\nWhen I speak nobody listens\r\nThey label me villainous\r\nConforming to one religion\r\nAll non-pure inquisitions\r\nAre going down in remission\n\nIt's about time you witnessed\n\nThe power of one decision\n\nWhen I stalled for you fucking cowards\n\nYou made a false description to a kid's addiction\n\nThese words are louder than the fucking powder!\n\nTo my gun's ignition when it shoots the children\n\nThis is blood for this soul\n\nDon't care what you've been told\n\nI am not alone\n\n\n\nBleed, what you've done\n\nBleed, just for us\n\nYou can hide but you can't run\n\nOne day you'll end up where you belong\n\nBleed, what you've done\n\nBleed, get a gut\n\nYou can try and play it dumb\n\nOne day someone's gonna wake you up\n\nHey, I don't give a fuck\n\nHey, you ain't getting no love\n\nHey, don't think too much\n\n'Cause this time you're out of luck\n\n\n\nI'm viewed as the rebel who\n\nWorships Satan, praises the devil\n\nI've been itching to tell you\n\nI'm gonna be here longer than forever\n\nYour sniveling won't help, you\n\nMight as well be looking down the barrel\n\nIf I'm burning in hell then\n\nI guess we're all going down together\n\nI won't bow even if your crown\n\nWas sent to be from heaven or it was Armageddon\n\nI won't look down even if I'm bound\n\nGoing in no direction, ready for the redemption\n\nThis is blood for this soul\n\nDon't care what you've been told\n\nI am not alone\n\n\n\nBleed, what you've done\n\nBleed, just for us\n\nYou can hide but you can't run\n\nOne day you'll end up where you belong\n\nBleed, what you've done\n\nBleed, get a gut\n\nYou can try and play it dumb\n\nOne day someone's gonna wake you...\n\n\n\nUp!\n\nNo matter what!\n\nWe're not giving up!\n\nI won't ever keep my mouth shut!\n\nFuck!\n\nWhat you've become!\n\nWe've had enough!\n\nI'm gonna watch you suffer!\n\nHow do you like me now?\n\nNow that you're underground, not making a sound?\n\nI bet that you're proud\n\nOf pulling us on down\n\nYour sins will find you out\n\nWe don't need you around\n\n\n\nBleed, what you've done\n\nBleed, just for us\n\nYou can hide but you can't run\n\nOne day you'll end up where you belong\n\nBleed, what you've done\n\nBleed, get a gut\n\nYou can try and play it dumb\n\nOne day someone's gonna wake you up\n\nHey, I don't give a fuck\n\nHey, you ain't getting no love\n\nHey, don't think too much\n\n'Cause this time you're out of luck",
