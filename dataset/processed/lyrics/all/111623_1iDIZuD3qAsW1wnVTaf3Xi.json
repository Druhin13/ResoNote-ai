  "lyrics": "I am the rider, on the road I am a star\r\nA true reminder, what you seek is where you are\r\nI learned the hard way but still you always try to break me down\r\nYour love is sorrow, but still I know I'm glory-bound\r\nDon't get on my way, stand beside the dark, remember\n\nTimes change, I don't need you anymore\n\nNo way, no why, I don't need your alibi\n\nSo mind your man-, just mind your manners now\n\n\n\nDon't look me in the eye and say you did no wrong\n\nDon't brazenly deny you ever wished me gone\n\nI learned the hard way, I took the fall, it was a long way down\n\nYour love is sorrow, but still I know I'm glory-bound\n\n\n\nDon't get on my way, stand beside the dark, remember\n\nTimes change, I don't need you anymore\n\nNo way, no why, I don't need your alibi\n\nMind your man-, just mind your manners now\n\n\n\nMind your manners now\n\nJust remember in the end I'm glory-bound\n\n\n\nDon't look me in the eye and say you did no wrong\n\nDon't need to compromise, tomorrow I'll be gone\n\n\n\nDon't get on my way, stand beside the dark, remember\n\nTimes change, I don't need you anymore\n\nNo way, no why, I don't need your alibi\n\nMind your man-, just mind your manners now\n\nJust mind your manners now\n\nJust mind your manners now\n\nJust mind your manners now\n\nJust mind your manners now",
