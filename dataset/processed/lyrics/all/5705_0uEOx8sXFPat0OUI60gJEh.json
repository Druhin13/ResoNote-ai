  "lyrics": "Bugles are calling from prairie to shore, \n\"Sign up\" and \"Fall In\" and march off to war. \nBlue grass and cotton, burnt and forgotten \nAll hope seems gone so soldier march on to die. \n\nBugles are calling from prairie to shore, \n\n\"Sign up\" and \"Fall In\" and march off to war. \n\nThere in the distance a flag I can see, \n\nScorched and in ribbons but whose can it be, \n\nHow ends the story, whose is the glory \n\nAsk if we dare, our comrades out there who sleep.",
