  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Dry Spells par Pianos Become The Teeth\r\nPatterns, they fall, she can hear\nAnd I fold your dress\nAnd I'm wound, I rise in reverence\nIn the morning light\nI pull down the stripes\nIn the window white\nBar by bar, line by line\nIn the morning light\nShe just comes alive\nDissolve at the sight\nI see her changing like fire\n\nShow your body of God\nAll your blonde waves, untamed\n\nThese spells, pure hell, dry as bone\n\nAnd I fold your dress\nI howl, I drown in depravity\nHeavy fist with no relief\n\nShow your body of God\nAll your blonde waves, untamed\nAnd after all the patter taunts\nThe rising heat just breaks and drops\nAnd after all the waterfalls\nI love the taste and I can't stop\n\nShe floods down hard\nPours from the heavens\nGives it a rest on my chest\nShe puts on faces everyday\nShe will always pull the strings\nSteal my dreams\n\n\nTear my body apart\nAll your blonde waves, untamed\nAnd after all the patter taunts\nThe rising heat just breaks and drops\nAnd after all the waterfalls\nI love the taste and I can't stop\n\nI want to rattle walls\nI want to rattle walls\nI want so much more\nI want so much more",
