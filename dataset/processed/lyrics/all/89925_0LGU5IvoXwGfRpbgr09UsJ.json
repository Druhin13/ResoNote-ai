Uh\n\nAm I a barrier or am I a bridge? Uh\n\nYou know the scary thing about it is\n\nIs how I\n\nAlways make excuses when you wanna put time in\n\nTalkin' bout next week, I feel like I ain't gonna be alive then\n\nShe said she ready to see us die then\n\nSay you got all the controls, just pull the fire-pin\n\nLook at you killin' with mad precision\n\nHer brain got traffic, then I crash it, then I\n\nWonder if you knew how fast you'd driven, uh\n\nIf I turn my back to your bad decisions\n\nJust don't give me warning, just stab me in it\n\nAskin', can you not?\n\n\n\nDon't warn me (Don't, don't, don't)\n\nI'd rather be surprised (Don't)\n\nDon't warn me (Hey)\n\nNow I'm prepared to die, so\n\nSaved, don't warn me\n\nSaved, do-do-do-doo-do-doo\n\nSaved (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)",
