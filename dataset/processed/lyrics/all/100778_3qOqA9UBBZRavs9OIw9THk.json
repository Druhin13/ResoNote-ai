  "lyrics": "You tell mountains they must fall and they fall\r\nYou tell oceans to be still and they're calm\r\nYou tell sickness it must leave and it's gone\r\nIn my weakness, God, I know You are strong\r\nYou are the one above it all\n\nI stand in awe, You're the God over all I know\n\nNo higher Name, no greater throne\n\nYou stand alone, You're the God over all I know\n\n\n\nYou tell broken things be healed and they're whole\n\nYou tell fear it has no place, it must go\n\nYou tell death it has no chance, it won't win\n\nAnd if You are for me, God what can come against?\n\n\n\nYou are the one above it all\n\nI stand in awe, You're the God over all I know\n\nNo higher Name, no greater throne\n\nYou stand alone, You're the God over all I know\n\nYou are the one above it all\n\nI stand in awe, You're the God over all I know\n\nNo higher Name, no greater throne\n\nYou stand alone, You're the God over all I know\n\n\n\nI believe it, I have seen it\n\nMy God is over all\n\nI believe it, I have seen it\n\nMy God is over all\n\nI believe it, I have seen it\n\nMy God is over all\n\nI believe it, I have seen it\n\nMy God is over all\n\n\n\nYou are the one above it all\n\nI stand in awe, You're the God over all I know\n\nNo higher Name, no greater throne\n\nYou stand alone, You're the God over all I know\n\nYou are the one above it all\n\nI stand in awe, You're the God over all I know\n\nNo higher Name, no greater throne\n\nYou stand alone, You're the God over all I know",
