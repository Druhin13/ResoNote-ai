  "lyrics": "I can hear those trucks on the highway tonight\r\nI can hear those kids down the block playin' ball\r\nI can hear the drone of my boss in my head\r\nSayin' \"This weekend I need you on call\"\r\nThe volume's up, the pressure's on, the phone is buzzin'\r\nYou're the only reason that I don't go crazy\n\n\n\n'Cause when we kiss, the world outside is gone\n\nAnd whatever longing there is moves on\n\nMy heart doesn't have any choice\n\nWhen I hear my name on your voice\n\nEverything else, everything else is just noise\n\n\n\nYour eyes cut through every distraction\n\nThrough the rage of the machine and the roar of the engines\n\nThis rock keeps turning, this city don't sleep\n\nYou're my secret shelter when I can't find peace\n\nThe way you touch, the way you whisper\n\nWay you love and how it lingers\n\nYou can make it all go away\n\n\n\n'Cause when we kiss, the world outside is gone\n\nAnd whatever longing there is moves on\n\nMy heart doesn't have any choice\n\nWhen I hear my name on your voice\n\nEverything else, everything else is just noise\n\n\n\n\n\n'Cause when we kiss, the world outside is gone\n\nAnd whatever longing there is moves on\n\nMy heart doesn't have any choice\n\nWhen I hear my name on your voice\n\nEverything else, everything else is just noise\n\nEverything else is just noise",
