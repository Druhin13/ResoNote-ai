  "lyrics": "Half a mind to leave the ground\r\nOur days like silk, all spun around\r\nYou kept me close, one inch off the cosmos\r\nWhere you're never alone\r\nBlue wings to lift me up\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\nUnder the wire comes my love\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\nBlue wings to lift me up\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\nUnder the wire comes my love\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\n\n\nAll my fears in a steam room stall\n\nI sweat and sweat 'til I've had enough\n\n'Til I'm in first place\n\n'Til our horse comes out ahead\n\nAnd my chest is full\n\n\n\nBlue wings to lift me up\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\nUnder the wire comes my love\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\nBlue wings to lift me up\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\nUnder the wire comes my love\n\n(Heartbeat stops, you lift me up)\n\n\n\nThere goes my life\n\nThere goes",
