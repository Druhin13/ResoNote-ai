  "lyrics": "I stand in the corner like a tired boxer\r\nOne hand on my cheekbone, one hand on the rope\r\nAnd all my veins pump blood into my throat\r\nSo I can hit the note, go do it all again\r\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\n\n\nAnd I lay half awake, thinking what's it's gonna take\n\nFor my moment to arrive, so sick and paralyzed\n\nAnd I chew my gum on the left side of my mouth\n\nWonder when I'll spit it out, yeah, I'm just getting started\n\n\n\nTell 'em all I said hi, hope you've been well\n\nYou've been asleep while I've been in hell\n\nTell 'em all I said hi, have a nice day\n\nI'll be just fine, don't worry 'bout me\n\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\n\n\nI stand in the corner like a tired boxer\n\nOne hand on my cheekbone, one hand on the rope\n\nAnd all my veins pump blood into my throat\n\nSo I can hit the note, go do it all again\n\n\n\nTell 'em all I said hi, hope you've been well\n\nYou've been asleep while I've been in hell\n\nTell 'em all I said hi, have a nice day\n\nI'll be just fine, don't worry 'bout me\n\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\n\n\nLying on my side, watching time fly by\n\nAnd I bet the whole world thought that I would give up today\n\nLying on my side, watching time fly by\n\nAnd I bet the whole world thought that I would give up today\n\nLying on my side, watching time fly by\n\nAnd I bet the whole world thought that I would give up today\n\nLying on my side, watching time fly by\n\nAnd I bet the whole world thought that I would give up\n\nYeah, I bet the whole world thought that I would give up\n\n\n\nTell 'em all I said hi, hope you've been well\n\nYou've been asleep while I've been in hell\n\nTell 'em all I said hi, have a nice day\n\nI'll be just fine, don't worry 'bout me\n\nTell 'em all I said hi (hi)\n\nTell 'em all I said hi",
