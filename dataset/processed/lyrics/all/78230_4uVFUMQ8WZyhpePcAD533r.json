  "lyrics": "There's something happening here\r\nWhat it is ain't exactly clear\r\nThere's a man with a gun over there\r\nTelling me I got to beware\r\nI think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound\r\nEverybody look what's going down\n\n\n\nThere's battle lines being drawn\n\nNobody's right if everybody's wrong\n\nYoung people speaking their minds\n\nGetting so much resistance from behind\n\nI think it's time we stop, hey, what's that sound\n\nEverybody look what's going down\n\n\n\nWhat a field-day for the heat\n\nA thousand people in the street\n\nSinging songs and carrying signs\n\nMostly say, hooray for our side\n\nIt's time we stop, hey, what's that sound\n\nEverybody look what's going down\n\n\n\nParanoia strikes deep\n\nInto your life it will creep\n\nIt starts when you're always afraid\n\nYou step out of line, the man come and take you away\n\n\n\nWe better stop, hey, what's that sound\n\nEverybody look what's going down\n\nStop, hey, what's that sound\n\nEverybody look what's going down\n\nStop, now, what's that sound\n\nEverybody look what's going down\n\nStop, children, what's that sound\n\nEverybody look what's going down",
