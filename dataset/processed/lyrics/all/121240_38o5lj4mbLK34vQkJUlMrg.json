  "lyrics": "It's been three months since I saw you\r\nJust a few texts here and there\r\nI saw you're on a beach somewhere\r\nI think I forgot to tell you\r\nI found that list on my phone\r\nOf places in London you wanted to go\n\n\n\nThose tourist shops around Camden Town\n\nTake a late night ride on the underground\n\nSee the gardens and drink one beer\n\nI know you would die if you knew I was here\n\n\n\nI feel so helpless and I feel so far away\n\nIf you knew where I was I wonder what you'd say\n\nI feel guilty and I don't know how to tell you\n\nI saw London without you\n\nI saw London without you\n\n\n\nEverything here makes me miss you\n\nSparkling picture of us, still in love\n\nHolding hands on a rooftop bus\n\nI haven't posted any pictures\n\n'Cause there's a part of me that\n\nStill believes that I'll bring you back to\n\n\n\nThese tourist shops around Camden Town\n\nTake a late night ride on the underground\n\nSee the gardens and drink one beer\n\nI would give the world, but I wish you were here\n\n\n\nI feel so helpless and I feel so far away\n\nIf you knew where I was I wonder what you'd say\n\nI feel guilty and I don't know how to tell you\n\nI saw London without you\n\nI saw London without you\n\nI saw London without you",
