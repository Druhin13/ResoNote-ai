  "lyrics": "No more hesitating but my body is shaking, not obeying\r\nSlowly decaying\r\nAnd my self-control- it is breaking\r\nEven the sun and the moon\r\nI can't count on them my luck is all spent\r\nBut this isn't the end\n\nI'm repeating those words again and again\n\n\n\nThey're poor odds I'm facing\n\nBut you won't catch me fleeing, I'm not leaving\n\nDon't need a reason\n\nI know the future's ahead, let's seize it\n\nAnd it's a chance that I'm taking\n\nEyes on the prize\n\nI'm not holding back\n\nCause the pride of winning is all you need\n\n\n\nI wanna dine on the sweet wine of victory\n\nBut we may only get the stale taste of defeat\n\nBut it's fine either way\n\nI'll take these threads of fate\n\nAnd I will create a new world of our own\n\n\n\nDo or die, golden time lover's gonna blow your mind\n\nRaise the stakes - poker face\n\nGive me all you got, here we go\n\nYeah, I know those illusions will drag you into it\n\nIt's the same, endless game\n\nBut somehow I'll find my way\n\nIt's a fine borderline\n\nBut I'll walk it still\n\nWhat's the price - won't think twice, I will pay it right here in this moment\n\nFor you, I'd give the world, and you know it\n\n\n\nIn this game we're playing\n\nOnly fact is what beats the fiction baby\n\nSo no delaying make your move\n\nBefore they see through it\n\nReading between all the lines\n\nYou'll know at first glance, your senses are enhanced\n\nSo don't waste the chance to play your hand\n\n'Cause when your fate, it all weighs on your game sense\n\nYou gotta make a choice between the dark and the light\n\nYour demons you may meet\n\nYeah, you may face defeat\n\nBut not if you greet them with a fearless soul\n\n\n\nTake a stand - clap your hands\n\nAnd just do the best you can\n\nA worthwhile fighting style\n\nYou and me can go on as one\n\nAttention! Don't ya go alone\n\nYour luck, it's got limits\n\n\n\nA detailed fairy tale\n\nGive it life and make it real\n\nIt's a sweet victory\n\nYou'll never forget\n\nCome with me - you ready?\n\nThrow away your doubt there's nothing to fear now\n\nTake a step and we'll move up this staircase\n\n\n\nEvery time you smile, it's like an angel's\n\nEvery time I'm falling, your charming eyes meet mine\n\nEven now I feel I'm being drawn to you\n\nDo you feel the static between our heartbeats?\n\nDo you see the same future when you close your eyes?\n\nI don't even think the world could stop us now\n\n\n\nDo or die, golden time lover's gonna blow your mind\n\nRaise the stakes - poker face\n\nGive me all you got, here we go\n\nYeah, I know those illusions will drag you into it\n\nIt's the same, endless game\n\nBut somehow I'll find my way\n\nIt's a fine borderline\n\nBut I'll walk it still\n\nWhat's the price - won't think twice, I will pay it right here in this moment\n\n\n\nTake a stand - clap your hands\n\nAnd just do the best you can\n\nA worthwhile fighting style\n\nYou and me can go on as one\n\nAttention! Don't ya go alone\n\nYour luck, it's got limits\n\n\n\nA detailed fairy tale\n\nGive it life and make it real\n\nIt's a sweet victory\n\nYou'll never forget\n\nCome with me - you ready?\n\nThrow away your doubt there's nothing to fear now\n\nTake a step and we'll move on together",
