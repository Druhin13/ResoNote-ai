  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Shadow par Alexandra Burke\r\nOh yeah\n\nThe birds and the trees, they don't sing no more\nThese autumn leaves are lying down on the floor\nJust like mister love, we gonna let it fall, oh yeah\nAin't nothing left but a picture frame\nYou're forgetting my face, so don't say my name\nDon't wanna break down, it's going up in flames\n\nYeah, you got me running down the wrong road\nYeah, I'm swimming in the shallows\nThat's not the love that I seek in what you're giving to me\nI want a love that runs deep, want it as deep as the sea\n\n\nOh, but I just keep holding on to your shadow\nTry to run but I know it's return to your ghost\nI keep clinging to everything I have once loved\nBut love don't live here anymore\nOh, but I just keep holding on to your shadow\n\nI have the key to your heart, you changed the lock on the door\nWon't even bother to knock, I know that nobody's home\nYou're not the person that I knew before, oh\nLike the bones of our love is buried deep in the ground\nLike the wings of a dove, you can't be holding us down\nLet it go, let it go, yeah, forget all the vows\n\n\nYeah, you got me running down the wrong road\nYeah, I'm swimming in the shallows\nThat's not the love that I seek in what you're giving to me\nI want a love that runs deep, want it as deep as the sea\n\nOh, but I just keep holding on to your shadow\nTry to run but I know it's return to your ghost\nI keep clinging to everything I have once loved\nBut love don't live here anymore\nOh, but I just keep holding on to your shadow\n\nTime is running, let the water come in from the sea\nWasting time on that someone who's not meant to be\nLet it go, let it go, go and set yourself free, free, free\n\n\nYeah, you got me running down the wrong road\n(Yeah) yeah, I'm swimming in the shallows (swimming in the shallows)\nThat's not the love that I seek in what you're giving to me\nI want a love that runs deep, want it as deep as the sea (yeah, yeah, oh no)\n\nOh, but I just keep holding on to your shadow (on to your shadow, on to your shadow)\nTry to run but I know it's return to your ghost\nI keep clinging to everything I have once loved\nBut love don't live here anymore\nOh, but I just keep holding on to your shadow (your shadow, shadow, shadow, oh)\n\nI just keep holding on to your shadow",
