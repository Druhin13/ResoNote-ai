  "lyrics": "Echoes in the dark\r\nYou called out my name\r\nI chained myself in a cellar\r\nBuilt out of failure and shame\r\nYou try to give me shelter\r\nI kept choosing the rain\n\nI'm standing on a ledge\n\nAbove a fall I can't face\n\nBut you pushed me anyway\n\n\n\nYou got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender\n\nYou wrapped me in a white flag in my darkest hours\n\nSo tell me will you stay now?\n\n'Cause I feel like I'm saved now\n\nYou got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender\n\n\n\nDidn't even try to cry out for help\n\nThe only thing he ever did was help me destroy myself\n\nI'm better now with you, even when I'm in hell\n\nYou pick me up, pull me out like nobody else\n\nYeah, you pushed the ground away\n\n\n\nYou got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender\n\nYou wrapped me in a white flag in my darkest hours\n\nSo tell me will you stay now?\n\n'Cause I feel like I'm saved now\n\nYou got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender\n\n\n\nI take off my armour when you love me harder\n\nAll my defences come down\n\nI take off my armour when you love me harder\n\nI'm alright, I'm alright now\n\n\n\nYou got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender\n\nYou wrapped me in a white flag in my darkest hours\n\nSo tell me will you stay now?\n\n'Cause I feel like I'm saved now\n\nYou got me in a free fall, you're my sweet surrender\n\n\n\nI take off my armour when you love me harder\n\nAll my defences come down\n\nI take off my armour when you love me harder\n\nI'm alright, I'm alright now",
