  "lyrics": "It was like a movie scene\r\nA cut out from a magazine\r\nWe are not even real\r\nNor are the things we think we feel\r\nGoing back to 030\n\nFly for 20 hours or so\n\nThousand miles apart in heart and soul\n\nNow the rub is burning\n\nNow the wheels are turning\n\nI don't care as long as you don't\n\n\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast\n\n\n\nI met you on the dance floor\n\nI was high and you were bored\n\nI asked you for a lighter\n\nAnd you thought, \"Oh, I like her\"\n\n\n\nGoing back to 030\n\nBack and forth but we go forth\n\nNothing lasts forever, no\n\nYou spent all our money\n\nUsed to call me honey\n\nI know that you're sorry, ooh\n\n\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast\n\n\n\nWe're dying for connection\n\nHoping that we get some\n\nSome sort of reaction\n\nMaybe we just need attention?\n\nWe go driving, we go driving\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nWe go driving, we go driving\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\n\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast\n\nWe go driving in your black car\n\nPick me up and love fast",
