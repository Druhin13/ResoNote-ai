  "lyrics": "Am I really that sorrow filled?\r\nFucking to feel, nothing is real\r\nSaid you had no discipline\r\nSavoring what passion was left\r\nIn my mind\n\nKeep perspective out my timeline\n\nI don't need it, I don't want it\n\nYou really had it going, all I had to do\n\nWas fall for it, take an L for it\n\n\n\nJust another crimson light\n\nMaking you side with me\n\nIt's alright if you make a friend\n\nPicking sides, making your eyes at me\n\nThere's no shame in closed hands\n\nLost ties\n\n\n\nYou had it all where you started from\n\nAnd I was there doing good by no one\n\nSo you wanna backtrack to when you tracked what you had\n\nYeah you were a real sidestepper\n\nHad to be the reason that you\n\nCalled me crazy\n\n\n\nKeep perspective out my timeline\n\nI don't need it, I don't want it\n\n\n\nJust another crimson light\n\nMaking you side with me\n\nIt's alright if you make a friend\n\nPicking sides, making your eyes at me\n\nThere's no shame in closed hands\n\nLost ties",
