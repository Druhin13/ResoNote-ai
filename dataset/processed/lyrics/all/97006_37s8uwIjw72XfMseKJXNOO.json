  "lyrics": "Daylight is fading away,\r\nNight silhouettes in the sky,\r\nLED lights are flashing on towers,\r\nIt`s Manhattan`s magical time.\r\nBallerinas dancing \"Swan Lake\",\n\nOn a river made of diamonds and pearls,\n\nEverything is a little bit weird now.\n\n\n\nBecause tonight, \n\nIt is showtime,\n\nIn the middle of the street life,\n\nAll we celebrate good times, \n\nBecause tonight it is showtime.\n\n\n\nCome and walk with me...\n\n\n\n1273 down to Rockefeller Street,\n\nLife is marchin' on do you feel that?\n\n1273 down to Rockefeller Street,\n\nEverything is more than surreal. \n\n\n\nOld school Hollywood stars,\n\nParty Cinderellas are here,\n\nThey move like computer game heroes.\n\n\n\nBecause they know,\n\nIt is showtime,\n\nIn the middle of the street life,\n\nAll they celebrate good times, \n\nBecause tonight it is showtime.\n\n\n\nSo let`s keep movin on...\n\n\n\n1273 down to Rockefeller Street\n\nLife is marchin' on do you feel that?\n\n1273 down to Rockefeller Street,\n\nEverything is more than surreal.\n\n\n\nKeep movin', keep movin', keep movin', keep movin', \n\nIf you want to know what Rockefeller groove is,\n\nKeep movin', keep movin', keep movin', keep movin',\n\nTime is right to celebrate good times.",
