  "lyrics": "I'm sitting, stuck in another daze again, i know\r\nStaring at this empty space i call my home\r\nThings have been silent and it never has been\r\nSince you walked out the door\r\nMaybe this is the regretting stage\r\nAm I keeping my cool or saving face\r\nI thought that it would all be bliss\r\nThat after this is an easy fix, guess who's wrong\r\nI couldn't have been more wrong\r\nWe drifted away\r\nAnd thats the way it will stay\r\nYou helped me find my place\r\nBut we both seem to have faded, faded\r\nAway\r\nAngelic demeanor with the words of a preacher, that's her\r\nI've always believed her and the\r\ntruth thats within the things she says\r\nAs hard as my head was, as closed as my heart was\r\nShe found a way\r\nAnd maybe this is me saving face\r\nKeeping all these thoughts in one place, oh my\r\nThe details that you never miss\r\nThe feeling of your goodnight kisses\r\nThey're just memories of a stranger that id once known\r\nWe've drifted away\r\n(and thats the way it should stay)\r\nYou helped me find my place\r\nBut we both seem to have faded, faded\r\nAway",
