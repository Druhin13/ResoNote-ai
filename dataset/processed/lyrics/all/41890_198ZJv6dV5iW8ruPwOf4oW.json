  "lyrics": "I can see very well\r\nThere's a boat on the reef with a broken back\r\nAnd I can see it very well\r\nThere's a joke and I know it very well\r\nIt's one of those that I told you long ago\r\nTake my word I'm a madman don't you know\n\n\n\nOnce a fool had a good part in the play\n\nIf it's so would I still be here today\n\nIt's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way\n\nThey think it's very funny everything I say\n\nGet a load of him, he's so insane\n\nYou better get your coat dear\n\nIt looks like rain\n\n\n\nWe'll come again next Thursday afternoon\n\nThe In-laws hope they'll see you very soon\n\nBut is it in your conscience that you're after\n\nAnother glimpse of the madman across the water\n\n\n\nI can see very well\n\nThere's a boat on the reef with a broken back\n\nAnd I can see it very well\n\nThere's a joke and I know it very well\n\nIt's one of those that I told you long ago\n\nTake my word I'm a madman don't you know\n\n\n\nThe ground's a long way down but I need more\n\nIs the nightmare black\n\nor are the windows painted\n\nWill they come again next week\n\nCan my mind really take it",
