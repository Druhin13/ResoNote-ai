  "lyrics": "How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a\r\nScotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten\r\nSpot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor\r\nGrow up to be a hero and a scholar?\r\nThe ten-dollar Founding Father without a father\r\nGot a lot farther by working a lot harder\n\nBy being a lot smarter\n\nBy being a self-starter\n\nBy fourteen, they placed him in charge of the trading charter\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nMy name is Alexander Hamilton\n\nAnd there’s a million things I haven’t done\n\nBut just you wait, just you wait\n\n\n\nWait for it\n\nWait for it\n\nWait for it\n\nWait for it\n\nI am the one thing in life I can control\n\nWait for it\n\nWait for it\n\nWait for it\n\nWait for it\n\nI am inimitable\n\nI am an original\n\nAnd if there’s a reason I’m still alive\n\nWhen so many have died\n\nThen I’m willin' to—\n\n\n\nI’m willing to\n\nWork, work!\n\nAngelica!\n\nWork, work!\n\nEliza!\n\nAnd Peggy—\n\nLook around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now!\n\nHistory is happening in Manhattan and we just happen to be\n\nIn the greatest city\n\nIn the greatest city in the world!\n\n\n\nThe world turned upside down\n\nThe world turned upside down\n\nThe world turned upside down\n\nThe world turned upside down\n\n\n\nYeah you’ll blow us all away\n\n\n\nOceans rise, empires fall\n\nWe have seen each other through it all\n\nAnd when push comes to shove\n\nI will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!\n\nDa da da dat da dat da da da da ya da\n\nDa da dat dat da da ya da!\n\n\n\nNo one else was in\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nNo one else was in\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nNo one really knows how the game is played\n\nThe art of the trade\n\nHow the sausage gets made\n\nWe just assume that it happens\n\nBut no one else is in the room where it happens\n\n\n\nWe are outgunned (What?)\n\nOutmanned (What?)\n\nOutnumbered\n\nOutplanned\n\nWe gotta make an all out stand\n\nAyo, I’m gonna need a right-hand man\n\n\n\nHamilton!\n\nSir, he knows what to do in a trench\n\nIngenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—\n\nHamilton!\n\nSir, you’re gonna have to use him eventually\n\nWhat’s he gonna do on the bench? I mean—\n\nHamilton!\n\nNo one has more resilience\n\nOr matches my practical tactical brilliance—\n\nHamilton!\n\nYou wanna fight for your land back?\n\nHamilton!\n\nI need my right hand man back!\n\nUh, get ya right hand man back\n\nYou know you gotta get ya right hand man back\n\nI mean you gotta put some thought into the letter but the sooner the better\n\nTo get your right hand man back!\n\n\n\nIt must be nice, it must be nice\n\nTo have Washington on your side\n\nIt must be nice, it must be nice\n\nTo have Washington on your side\n\nLook back at the Bill of Rights (Which I wrote)\n\nThe ink hasn’t dried\n\nIt must be nice, it must be nice\n\nTo have Washington on your side—\n\nSomebody has to stand up for the South!\n\nSomebody has to stand up to his mouth!\n\nIf there’s a fire you’re trying to douse\n\nYou can’t put it out from inside the house\n\nI’m in the cabinet, I am complicit in\n\nWatching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it\n\nIf Washington isn’t gon’ listen\n\nTo disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:\n\nThis kid is out\n\n\n\nIn New York you can be a new man\n\n\n\nHow do you write like you’re running out of time?\n\nWrite day and night like you’re running out of time?\n\nEv’ry day you fight like you’re running out of time\n\nLike you’re running out of time\n\nAre you running out of time?\n\n\n\nLet me tell you what I wish I’d known\n\nWhen I was young and dreamed of glory\n\nYou have no control\n\nWho lives, who dies, who tells your story\n\nI know that we can win\n\nI know that greatness lies in you\n\nBut remember from here on in\n\nHistory has its eyes on you (Whoa…)\n\n\n\nAnd I am not throwing away my shot\n\nI am not throwing away my shot\n\nHey yo, I’m just like my country\n\nI’m young, scrappy and hungry\n\nAnd I’m not throwing away my shot\n\nWe gonna rise up, time to take a shot (Not throwing away my shot)\n\nWe gonna rise up, time to take a shot (Not throwing away my shot)\n\nWe’re gonna rise up, rise up! (It’s time to take a shot!)\n\nRise up, rise up!\n\nAnd I am not throwing away my\n\nNot throwing away my shot\n\n\n\nThere’s a million things I haven’t done\n\nBut just you wait (Just wait)\n\nWhat’s your name, man?\n\nAlexander (Hamilton)\n\nAlexander (Hamilton)\n\nAlexander (Hamilton)\n\nAlexander",
