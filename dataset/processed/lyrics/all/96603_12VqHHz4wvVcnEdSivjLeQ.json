  "lyrics": "Unread texts and missed calls\r\nTold everyone I turned my phone off\r\nDidn't ask for help and now I’m lost\r\nLife comes in phases\r\nConsequences and mistakes\r\nI'm sorry that it's taken me so long\n\n\n\nMister, mister, please let off your power\n\nGive me half an hour, or better yet, a few\n\nOnly sweet until it all goes sour\n\nBut life is what you make it, and then there’s more to lose\n\n\n\nGatekeeper, can you show me more to life?\n\nLately, I've been living out of spite\n\nGrim reaper, just give me one more night\n\nI need another chance to say goodbye\n\nI shouldn't have to die to feel alive\n\n\n\nHere's the thing with disappearing\n\nYou can yell and no one hears you\n\nTimes like this, I need an ear\n\nWhen I finally have so much to say\n\nWish I could see your face, oh\n\nAnd do what I have to stop the tears\n\n\n\nSister, sister, please know that I'm sorry\n\nI wish you could've stopped me from falling off the hill\n\nOnly sweet until it all goes sour\n\nLife is what you make it until it gets too real\n\n\n\nGatekeeper, can you show me more to life?\n\nLately, I've been living out of spite\n\nGrim reaper, just give me one more night\n\nI need another chance to say goodbye\n\nI shouldn't have to die to feel alive",
