  "lyrics": "Sick and tired of the bottom, need a better view\r\nGot me lookin' 'round my circle, is it bulletproof?\r\nSometimes I think until I go insane\r\nCan I even trust somebody with the same last name, uh?\r\nTons of crazy people running from the light, ah\r\nBad decisions that could come around and bite ya\n\nWish I could write just a little less\n\nWish I could cry, end all the noise up inside my head\n\n\n\nWhen it's over, it's over, it's over\n\nIt's over\n\n\n\nI'm watching all the moves you make\n\nCan't turn back now, it's too late\n\nCheck mate, there's no defending\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\nI'm counting all of your mistakes\n\nCaught up in a crossfire hurricane\n\nCheck mate, there's no defending\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\n\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\n\n\nI did it, took a second, but I realized\n\nI been looking for a reason just to sever ties\n\nOnly seeing what I wanna see\n\nGot me questioning the things that I started to believe\n\nParanoid from the drama in my life, uh\n\nTrust issues make it hard to sleep at night, uh\n\nWish I could whine just a little less\n\nWish I could cry, end all the noise up inside my head\n\n\n\nWhen it's over, it's over, it's over\n\nIt's over\n\n\n\nI'm watching all the moves you make\n\nCan't turn back now, it's too late\n\nCheck mate, there's no defending\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\nI'm counting all of your mistakes\n\nCaught up in a crossfire hurricane\n\nCheck mate, there's no defending\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\n\n\nWhen it's over, it's over, it's over\n\nWhen it's over, it's over, it's over\n\nWhen it's over, it's over, it's over\n\nIt's over\n\n\n\nI'm watching all the moves you make\n\nCan't turn back now, it's too late\n\nCheck mate, there's no defending\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\nI'm counting all of your mistakes\n\nCaught up in a crossfire hurricane\n\nCheck mate, there's no defending\n\nThis is the start of the ending\n\n\n\nThis is the start of the ending",
