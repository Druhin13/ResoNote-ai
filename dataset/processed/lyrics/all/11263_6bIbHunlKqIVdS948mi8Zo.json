  "lyrics": "Turn away, away from the day\nLook towards the sun, you’ve already won\nLorelei, you don’t have to hide\nThere’s more to see, it’s your fantasy\n\nRunning through life so aimlessly\n\nClosing your eyes to everything in sight\n\nI can’t believe how much you’ve changed\n\nSomething tells me nothing is the same\n\n\n\nGuess she’s got a heart made of metal\n\nOh, oh-oh no\n\nTell she’s got a heart made of metal\n\nLorelei’s got nothing to hide, don’t know why\n\n\n\nGuess she’s got a heart made of metal\n\nOh, oh-oh no\n\nTell she’s got a heart made of metal\n\nLorelei’s got nothing to hide\n\n\n\nDon’t know why, Lorelei\n\nLorelei, Don’t know\n\n\n\nNothing that we’ve been through, babe\n\nHas ever been enough\n\nYou just pack me up and send me off\n\nLike I have lost my touch\n\nLooking back, I’ve been so foolish\n\nHow could I not tell?\n\nI can see you soaring high up in the sky\n\nWhile I’m stuck in hell\n\nLorelei you won’t escape my thoughts so presently\n\nIt’s a cold…",
