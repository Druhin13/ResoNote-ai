  "lyrics": "If you can't be happy with me\r\nBe unhappy with me\r\nStay unhappy with me\r\nIf you can't find peace in my arms\r\nFind dis-ease in my arms\r\nAs you please with my arms\n\nGo, I'll fight you every step of the way\n\nKnow, that nothing now will be the same\n\nAs right as rain\n\nIf you feel like nothing with me\n\nAnd see nothing in me\n\nThen be nothing with me\n\nIf you can't find rest in my bed\n\nThen don't bother your head\n\nLie awake there instead\n\nOh and may you never sleep again\n\nSow and may you never reap again\n\nAs right as rain\n\nTakes one to make you suffer\n\nOne to leave you on your own\n\nTakes one to make you suffer\n\nAnd one to leave you on your own\n\nIt's a sad-sack affair\n\nAnd you want it\n\nYou want it\n\nYou want it\n\nIt's a loud life out there\n\nBut you hear yourself speak\n\nWhen you're on it\n\nAnd before I don't care...\n\nIf you can't be happy with me\n\nBe unhappy with me\n\nStay unhappy with me",
