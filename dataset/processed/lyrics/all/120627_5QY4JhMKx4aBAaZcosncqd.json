  "lyrics": "From the hot strobe lights and the spiked punch bliss\r\nAnd the long walks home in the dark we'll miss\r\nNobody teaches you how to reminisce\r\nNobody teaches you to hurt like this\r\nThen we slide into the arms of someone else\n\nYeah, we slide into the arms of someone else\n\n\n\nNo more coked up, broke, nocturnal kids\n\nWas that ever even us? Do we know what we missed?\n\nNobody teaches you how to win big\n\nNobody said there's no reverse on this\n\n\n\nThen we slide into the arms of someone else\n\nYeah, we slide into the arms of someone else\n\nIn disguise, we get a little better \n\nAt controlling ourselves around midnight\n\nThen we slide into the arms of someone else\n\n\n\nNobody wants to, nobody wants to\n\nNobody wants to, nobody wants to\n\nNobody wants to wake up alone\n\n\n\nThen we slide into the arms of someone else\n\nThen we slide into the arms of someone else\n\nIn disguise, we get a little better \n\nAt controlling ourselves around midnight\n\nBut then we slide into the arms of some, someone else\n\n\n\nThe weight of the world is love\n\nUnder the burden of solitude, under the burden of dissatisfaction the weight, the weight we carry is love\n\nAnd so must rest in the arms of love at last, must rest in the arms of love",
