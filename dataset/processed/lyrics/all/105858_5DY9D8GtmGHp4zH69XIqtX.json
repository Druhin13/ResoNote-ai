  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Try not to breathe par R.E.M\r\n   \n\nI will try not to breathe.\nI can hold my head still with my hands at my knees.\nThese eyes are the eyes of the old, shiver and fold.\n\nI will try not to breathe.\nThis decision is mine. I have lived a full life\nand these are the eyes that I want you to remember. Oh.\n\nI need something to fly over my grave again.\nI need something to breathe.\n\n\nI will try not to burden you.\nI can hold these inside. I will hold my breath\nuntil all these shivers subside,\njust look in my eyes.\n\nI will try not to worry you.\nI have seen things that you will never see.\nLeave it to memory me. I shudder to breathe.\n\nI want you to remember. Oh. (you will never see)\nI need something to fly (something to fly)\nover my grave again. (you will never see)\nI need something to breathe. (something to breathe)\nBaby, don't shiver now.\nWhy do you shiver now ? (I will see things you will never see)\nI need something to fly (something to fly)\n\nover my grave again. (I will see things you will never see)\nI need something to breathe. Oh. Oh. Oh.\n\nI will try not to worry you.\nI have seen things that you will never see.\nLeave it to memory me. Don't dare me to breathe.\n\nI want you to remember. Oh. (you will never see)\nI need something to fly (something to fly)\nover my grave again. (you will never see)\nI need something to breathe. (something to breathe)\nBaby, don't shiver now.\nWhy do you shiver now ? (I will see things you will never see)\nI need something to breathe. (something to breathe - I have seen things\n\nyou will never see)\nI want you to remember.",
