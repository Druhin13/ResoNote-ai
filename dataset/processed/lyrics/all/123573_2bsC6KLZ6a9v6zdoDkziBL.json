  "lyrics": "I know you think I think too much\r\nBut I don't know if it's enough\r\nDirty love, all I want are your eyes on mine\r\nAnd underneath of it all\r\nI dream of a thousand shooters\r\nHallelujahs, are unable to save us\n\n\n\nBut did I ever want love?\n\nOr, did I ask too much?\n\nYoung dirty love, come get us strung\n\nLet's cover up what we really want\n\n\n\nAnd, all you see and all you feel\n\nAre skin and bones they don't hold the show like real love\n\nNo, you can't control who you really are or what you really want\n\nSo, I met you in the hotel, dim little lobby\n\nIâ€™ve been on the road since you last saw me\n\nAnd I don't need a reason to bleed until we're even\n\n\n\nBut did I ever want love?\n\nOr, did I ask too much?\n\nYoung dirty love, come get us strung\n\nLet's cover up what we really want\n\n\n\nOh, is it any wonder our love\n\nIsn't what we thought it was?\n\nIs it any wonder our love\n\nIsn't what we thought it was?\n\nIs it any wonder, oh lord\n\nIs it any wonder our love\n\nIsn't what we thought it was?\n\nWhen all we do is hurt ourselves",
