  "lyrics": "One road lead to the east\r\nAnother to the west\r\nIn a fit of desperation\r\nIn the dark I sought redress\r\nAs the clouds began to gather\r\nOh I wailed like a newborn babe, newborn babe\n\nAnd opened the book\n\nOf bad decisions I have made, I have made\n\n\n\nI walked in the station\n\nAll covered in blood\n\nThe watchman came out\n\n\"You can't be here, son\"\n\nSo I threw down my suitcase\n\nOh I wailed like a newborn babe, newborn babe\n\nAnd wrote another chapter\n\nOf bad decisions I have made, I have made\n\n\n\nI saw Ma Bell\n\nLooking lonesome in her time\n\nI picked up her receiver\n\nAnd dropped a dime\n\nWhen I heard you answer\n\nOh I wailed like a newborn babe, newborn babe\n\nAnd read the dedication\n\nFrom the book of bad decisions I have made, I have made",
