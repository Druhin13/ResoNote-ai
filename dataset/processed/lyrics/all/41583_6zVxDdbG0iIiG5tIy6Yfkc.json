  "lyrics": "You are too cold from the snow\r\nYou’re so lost, still you go\r\nYou’re afraid to lose composure\r\nBut you hate having control\r\nSo in love with the feeling\n\nAll the joy that you're stealing\n\nYou were never meant to be here\n\nNever meant to know the answers to your dreams\n\n\n\nI want to believe your lies\n\nWalking with shut eyes into the storm\n\nI’m bringing you home\n\nYou’re not alone\n\n\n\nFighting for your life\n\nThrough the darkest night I keep you warm\n\nI’m bringing you home\n\nOut of the storm\n\n\n\nWho believes you?\n\nWhen you say you’re fine, but you're out of your mind\n\nIt's so see through\n\nAnd you're showing signs of a broken mind\n\n\n\nSo in love with the feeling\n\nAll the joy that you're stealing\n\nYou were never meant to be here\n\nNever meant to know the answers to your dreams\n\n\n\nI want to believe your lies\n\nWalking with shut eyes into the storm\n\nI’m bringing you home\n\nYou’re not alone\n\n\n\nFighting for your life\n\nThrough the darkest night I keep you warm\n\nI’m bringing you home\n\nOut of the storm\n\n\n\nYou need to gain the courage to face the fear of change\n\nAnd you need to walk the distance\n\nYou need to come home safe\n\n\n\nI want to believe your lies\n\nWalking with shut eyes into the storm\n\nI’m bringing you home\n\nOut of the storm",
