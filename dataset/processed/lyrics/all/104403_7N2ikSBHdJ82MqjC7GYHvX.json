  "lyrics": "I don't have a leg to stand on\r\nSpinning like a whirlwind, nothing to land on\r\nCame so far, never thought it'd be done now\r\nStuck in a holding pattern waiting to come down, oh\r\nDid somebody else define me?\n\nCan I put the past behind me?\n\nDo I even have a decision?\n\nFeeling like I'm living in a story already written\n\nAm I part of a vision made by somebody else?\n\nPointing fingers at villains but I'm the villain myself\n\nOr am I out of conviction with no wind in the sail?\n\nToo focused on the end and simply ready to fail\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm tired of the fear that I can't control this\n\nI'm tired of feeling like every next step's hopeless\n\nI'm tired of being scared what I build might break apart\n\nI don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start\n\nOh, oh, oh...\n\nI don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start\n\nOh, oh, oh...\n\n\n\nHey Mike, uh, just calling to uh, you know, send my condolences\n\n\n\nHey man, it's Mark, just calling to check in on you, see how you're doing\n\n\n\nWhat up Mike? Just calling to see how you're doing, check in with you a little bit\n\n\n\nWanna obviously send my love and support and, um, \n\njust let you know I'm here for you\n\n\n\nI know you're super busy, didn't wanna bother you, um, \n\njust wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you\n\n\n\nGive me a call back if you want, if not, I guess that too, \n\num, but I'm sure I will see you and/or talk to you sometime soon. \n\nAlright bud, hope you're hanging in there. See ya",
