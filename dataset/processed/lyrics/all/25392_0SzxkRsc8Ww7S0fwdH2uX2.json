  "lyrics": "In the midst of all the doubt\r\nAll the uncertainty\r\nAll the frustration\r\nAll the confusion\r\nWe must never lose sight\r\nOf the parts of life\n\nThat we’re absolutely clear about\n\nThe parts of life that bring us\n\nUndeniable and reliable joy\n\nThese are sacred\n\n\n\nThey give us strength\n\nThey give us pure physical\n\nAnd emotional energy\n\nAnd that purely good feeling\n\nThat tells us that life\n\nReally is worth living\n\nEven when it’s hard\n\n\n\nThe truest part of ourself\n\nIs found inside the clarity of this feeling\n\nThis feeling is the life-force\n\nIt lives inside the undeniable love\n\nThat we have for the people\n\nAnd aspects of life\n\nThat bring out the best we have to offer\n\n\n\nLet this love define us\n\nLet our spirit be fortified\n\nBy this loving clarity\n\nThis love is our destiny\n\nAnd our ultimate quest\n\nIs to protect it\n\nTo amplify it\n\nAnd to rejoice\n\nIn sharing its power\n\nWith all the world",
