  "lyrics": "I haven't seen my father in some time\r\nBut his face is always staring back at me\r\nHis heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms\r\nAnd my colors change like the sea\r\nBut I don't worry much about time lost\r\nCause I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find\n\nHe told me how to walk the best that I can\n\nOn the road I left behind\n\n\n\nAnd most of all\n\nHe taught me to forgive\n\nHow to keep a cool head\n\nHow to love the one you're with\n\nAnd when I'm falling through the distance\n\nAnd the pushing comes to shove\n\nTo remember what comes back\n\nWhen you give away your love\n\nGive away your love\n\nWhen you give your love away\n\nGive away your love\n\n\n\nI haven't heard my mother's voice in a while\n\nBut her words are always falling out my mouth\n\nMy mind and spirit are at odds sometimes\n\nAnd they fight like the north and the south\n\nBut I still care enough about the way\n\nOf the heaviness through which my heart is tethered\n\nShe taught me how to be strong in saying goodbye\n\nAnd that love is forever\n\n\n\nBut most of all\n\nShe taught me how to fight\n\nHow to move across the line\n\nBetween the wrong and the right\n\nAnd when I'm turned out in the darkness\n\nAnd the pushing comes to shove\n\nTo remember what comes back\n\nWhen you give away your love\n\nGive away your love\n\nWhen you give your love away\n\nGive away your love\n\n\n\nGive your love away\n\nWhen you give your love away\n\nJust remember what comes back to you\n\nGive your love away\n\nWhen you give your love away\n\nAnd remember what comes back to you\n\n\n\nI haven't seen my father in some time\n\nBut his face is always staring back at me\n\nHis heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms\n\nAnd my colors change like the sea",
