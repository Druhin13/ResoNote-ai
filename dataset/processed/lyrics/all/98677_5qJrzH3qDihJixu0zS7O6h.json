  "lyrics": "Let me tell you something\r\nThat you don't wanna hear\r\nWanna tell you now\r\nJust because\r\nI used to hold your heart in the palm of my hand\r\nNow I only hold a grudge\n\nNow I'm a little crazy\n\nSo I don't understand\n\nWhy you never would take it from me\n\nOne day you'll wake up and you'll figure it out\n\nYou never really stole anything\n\n\n\nAnd all the friends you love will fade to black\n\nYou'll toss\n\nYou'll turn\n\nYou'll pray for your better half\n\nBut it won't call you back\n\n\n\nI don't know why I have so much hate in me\n\nIt bothers me\n\nI know it's just best if I just turn my cheek\n\nPeacefully\n\nBut I wanted to tell you\n\nThat you can go to hell, farewell\n\n\n\nI want to have feels\n\nWaking up every morning\n\nPast the point of no return\n\nIt must feel strange\n\nWaking up every morning\n\nUnder the bridges that you have burned\n\nAs god as your witness\n\nYou should pray for forgiveness\n\nFrom the cradle down to the grave\n\nAs for me\n\nThe words of a thief\n\nNever mattered much anyway\n\n\n\nAnd if you want the truth\n\nI'll give it there\n\nHit your knees\n\nAnd try to say a prayer\n\nCause it gets hot down there\n\n\n\nI don't know why I have so much hate in me\n\nIt bothers me\n\nI know it's just best if I just turn my cheek\n\nPeacefully\n\nBut I wanted to tell you\n\nOhhh\n\nI wanted to tell you\n\nI wanted to tell you\n\nThat you can go to hell, farewell\n\nFâ€‹arewell",
