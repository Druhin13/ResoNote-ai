  "lyrics": "I might lose my mind in a place like this\r\nI might take that risk\r\nI might brave the fire 'til the feeling hits\r\nUntil we both get lit\r\nImma take a dive, we could sink or swim\n\nImma take a shot, we could make or miss\n\nThere's no going back once we've gone all in\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be over you\n\nIf I can make you mine\n\nI don't wanna take closure now\n\nIf I can fix tonight\n\nI don't know if we can work this out, but I've got to try\n\nI don't wanna be over you\n\nIf I can make you mine\n\n\n\nSay that it's okay\n\nI know that it isnâ€™t\n\nSay you need space\n\nThat is your decision\n\nSay it to my face\n\nTell me how I'm tripping\n\nThis is something real\n\nI'm what you've been missing\n\n\n\nImma take a dive, we could sink or swim\n\nImma take a shot, we could make or miss\n\nThere's no going back once we've gone all in\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be over you\n\nIf I can make you mine\n\nI don't wanna take closure now\n\nIf I can fix tonight\n\nI don't know if we can work this out, but I've got to try\n\nI don't wanna be over you\n\nIf I can make you mine\n\n\n\nI just need you",
