  "lyrics": "From way back here on the bandstand\r\nShe looked like a goddess in the lights\r\nAt some point in the set she’d turn her face and glance my way most nights\r\nI’d take a little solo, I’d play for her, she’d smile, return the favor\r\nI’d make the sweetest love to her with every semiquaver\n\n“There’s a sadness in your playing,” she said\n\n“That penetrates my bones\n\nSomething in your intonation, something in your tone\n\nAlways understated, never overblown\n\nMy name for you is Sad Trombone\n\nYes, my name for you is Sad Trombone.”\n\n\n\nIt seemed like she’d found the secret key to my soul\n\nAnd gathered up my broken life and somehow made me whole\n\nWe’d share a room together, my bandmates were all green\n\nAnd they warned me ‘bout some story in a movie they’d all seen\n\n\n\n“There’s a sadness in your playing,” she said\n\n“That penetrates my bones\n\nSomething in your intonation, something in your tone\n\nAlways understated, never overblown\n\nMy name for you is Sad Trombone\n\nYes, my name for you is Sad Trombone.”\n\n\n\nNow when the light goes out and the music stops and the curtains close\n\nThat’s when your heartbeat race\n\nSadness on your face, and you can’t take no more\n\nI see you searching for your smile\n\nWe haven’t seen that in a while\n\nNow when the light goes out and the music stops and the curtains close\n\nThat’s Sad Trombone\n\n\n\nWe never made much money, the ticket counts were light\n\nWe’d count the bars until we reached some hotel for the night\n\nShe was my morning coffee, the butter on my toast\n\n‘Til she got a better offer from some outfit on the coast\n\n\n\nOh, there’s a sadness in my playing now\n\nA desperate cry, a moan\n\nSomething in my choice of notes\n\nSomething in my tone\n\nSliding to the deepest bass from a lonely baritone\n\nI guess I’ll always be the Sad Trombone\n\nI guess I’ll always be the Sad Trombone\n\n\n\nIt’s an old, old story, and one you’ve probably heard\n\nYou start out in a major key, then you’re down a minor third\n\nAimlessly sliding, sinking like a stone\n\nIt doesn’t get no deeper, than the scraps that you’ve been thrown\n\nBut some things they just stay with you, long after they have flown\n\nAnd it always comes back down…to the bone\n\nAnd it always comes back down…to the bone\n\nDown to the bone\n\nDown to the bone",
