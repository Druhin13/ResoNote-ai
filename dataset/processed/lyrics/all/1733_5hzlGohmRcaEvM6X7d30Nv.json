  "lyrics": "Someone said \"Youth is wasted on the young\"\r\nI spilled every last drop of time that summer in the sun\r\nMy daddy had a Timex watch\r\nCigarette in his hand and a mouthful of scotch\r\nSpinnin' me around like a tilt-a-whirl on his arm\n\nHouses need paint, winters bring snow\n\nKids, come on in before your supper gets cold\n\nCollection plates and daddy's billfold\n\nAnd that's how it goes\n\nYou live long enough, people get old\n\n\n\nI sat up right beside him in the cabin of that truck\n\nGoin' thirty miles-an-hour down a side road talkin' 'bout the fish we caught\n\nAnd I'm older now than he was then\n\nIf I could go back in time, I would in a second\n\nTo his beat-up blue jeans and a t-shirt with the sleeves cut off\n\n\n\nHouses need paint, winters bring snow\n\nKids growin' up and seekin' out the window\n\nHittin' every small-town dirt road\n\nAnd that's how it goes\n\nYou live long enough and people get old\n\nYeah, people get old\n\n\n\nDaddy keeps busy in the aftenoons playin' cards by himself\n\nAnd he shouldn't be shovelin' that first snow, but you know he won't take the help\n\nFull of pride and love, he don't say too much but hell, he never did\n\nAnd you still think he's forty-five and he still thinks that you're a kid\n\n\n\nOne day you'll find yourself sayin' the things that he said\n\nYou'll be walkin' down the hallway, turnin' off every light switch\n\nWhen you twirl your kids in your arms\n\nBefore you know it, it won't take too long\n\nThey'll be runnin' off makin' a life just like you did\n\n\n\nHouses need paint, winters bring snow\n\nNothin' says \"love\" like a band of gold\n\nBabies grow up and houses get sold\n\nAnd that's how it goes\n\nTime is a thief, pain is a gift\n\nThe past is the past, it is what it is\n\nEvery line on your face tells a story somebody knows\n\nThat's just how it goes\n\nYou live long enough and the people you love get old",
