  "lyrics": "Hold on, hold on\r\nDon't geek me up!\r\nCause first off, I just have to say that I'm shook\r\nBecause BET just keep on blessing me!\r\nDont- listen, listen!\r\nDon't act like ya'll ain't see the cypher\n\nDon't do that!\n\nI said, when it's paper work done I'm touching everything\n\nListen! But look, let me get straight to it\n\nThis award means so much to me cause it's a social media award and it was at one point in my career where social media was the only platform that I could use to release music\n\nSo I really appreciate being apart of this show and being here!\n\nAnd for all my Kash Bratz voting for me, um, I'm just excited Detroit in the building, let's get it! Haha\n\nThank you so much! I appreciate it! Bye!",
