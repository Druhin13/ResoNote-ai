  "lyrics": "It's getting late I haven't seen my date\rSo tell me when the boys get here\rIt's seven o'clock and I want to rock\rWant to get a belly full of beer\rMy old man's drunker than a bar full of winos\rAnd my old lady she don't care\rMy sister's looking cute in her braces and boots\rA handful of grease in her hair\rDon't give us none of your aggravation\rWe had it with your discipline\rSaturday night's alright for fighting\rGet a little action in\rGet about as oiled as a diesel train\rGonna set this dance alight\r'Cause Saturday night's the night I like\rSaturday night's alright alright alright\rWell they're packed pretty tight in here tonight\rI'm looking for a woman who'll see me right\rI may use a little muscle to get what I need\rI drink a fifth of jack and scream out \"She's with me!\"\rA couple of the sound that I really like\rAre the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike\rI'm a juvenile product of the working class\rWhose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass\rDon't give us none of your aggravation\rWe had it with your discipline\rSaturday night's alright for fighting\rGet a little action in\rGet about as oiled as a diesel train\rGonna set this dance alight\r'Cause Saturday night's the night I like\rSaturday night's alright alright alright\rDon't give us none of your aggravation\rWe had it with your discipline\rSaturday night's alright for fighting\rGet a little action in\rGet about as oiled as a diesel train\rGonna set this dance alight\r'Cause Saturday night's the night I like\rSaturday night's alright alright alright",
