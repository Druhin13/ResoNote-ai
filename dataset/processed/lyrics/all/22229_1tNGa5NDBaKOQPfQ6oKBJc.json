  "lyrics": "I sweep the cobwebs away\r\nRise from the slumber room\r\nKicking around come what may\r\nSell me a trick or two\r\nThe rising sky up above\r\nAlways au rendez-vous\n\nSomewhere I've been dreaming of\n\nOver the rainbow too\n\n\n\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\n\nSylvia says\n\nI lift my lids and all is born again\n\nSylvia says\n\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\n\nSylvia says\n\nI lift my lids and all is born again\n\nSylvia says\n\n\n\nPicking my socks for the day\n\nQuietly states my mood\n\nCan shape the future with clay\n\nStars waltzing out in blue\n\nAll is beyond and above\n\nNothing like deja-vu\n\nThis time I let down the gloves\n\nAwaking to bring me through\n\n\n\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\n\nSylvia says\n\nI lift my lids and all is born again\n\nSylvia says\n\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\n\nSylvia says\n\nI lift my lids and all is born again\n\nSylvia says\n\n\n\nWhat does the book have to say?\n\nI really don't have a clue\n\nIf by the end of the day\n\nHappy fool I salute\n\nFor what I'm about to receive\n\nMay the lord make me true-\n\n-ly thankful, then I'll believe\n\nAny crap, any cue\n\n\n\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\n\nSylvia says\n\nI lift my lids and all is born again\n\nSylvia says\n\nI shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\n\nSylvia says\n\nI lift my lids and all is born again\n\nSylvia says",
