  "lyrics": "I seep sourly into the depths of my mind\r\nAnd I find my sorriness so very hard to define\r\nI got my soul all twisted tangled in a noose so\r\nWhen the good outweighed the bad I said\r\n\"Oh hell what's the use?\"\r\n'Cause I keep skipping stones\n\nLike a child with broken bones\n\nAnd my mother always told me\n\n\"You gotta leave your bags at the door\"\n\n\n\nBut I didn't wanna talk it through\n\nSay things I don't give a fuck about\n\nNo, I didn't want to be next to you\n\nI was feeling sorry for myself\n\nAnd I like, I like, I like, I like my eggs sunny side up\n\nIs that a problem with you?\n\n'Cause I don't wanna live my life without you\n\nSo\n\n\n\nBaby girl why don't we slow it down?\n\nWe've been killing each other for months now\n\nBaby girl, why don't we slow this down?\n\nAnd don't go walking away from me, right now\n\nSo\n\nBaby girl, why don't we slow this down?\n\nAnd don't go walking away from me\n\n\n\nCall it lady marmalade\n\nYellow mellow\n\nThe way you touched my soul was so damn evil\n\nOh, Can you tell me what is that song?\n\nI heard it playing on the radio\n\n\n\nBut I didn't wanna talk it through\n\nSay things I don't give a fuck about\n\nNo, I didn't want to be next to you\n\nCause I was feeling sorry for myself\n\nAnd I like, I like, I like, I like my eggs sunny side up\n\nIs that a problem with you?\n\nAnd no, I don't carry on living my life with a pessimistic view\n\n\n\nSo, baby girl, why don't we slow it down?\n\nAnd don't go walking away from me right now, right now\n\nSo baby girl, why don't we slow it down?\n\nAnd don't go, don't go, don't, don't, don't, don't go\n\nWalking away from me, from me, from me\n\nFrom, from me",
