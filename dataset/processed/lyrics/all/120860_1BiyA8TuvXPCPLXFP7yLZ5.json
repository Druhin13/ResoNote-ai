  "lyrics": "I fell in\r\nTo love with a young boy\r\nAnd I fell out\r\nOf love with the man that young boy became\r\nSo am I to blame\r\nOr did the boy do the same?\n\n\n\nI got in\n\nWhen the goin' was easy\n\nAnd I got out\n\nWhen the goin' got tough\n\nWell, should I have hung on (Should I've hung on)\n\nTo a love that went wrong? (Love that went wrong)\n\nI had a hung-onto love\n\n\n\nChildhood darlin'\n\nDon't mean you no harm\n\n'Til you go on and grow up and apart\n\nSooner or later\n\nYou wake up to a stranger\n\nThat stole away your [darlin'?] and your heart\n\n\n\nI fell in\n\nTo love with a young boy\n\nAnd I fell out\n\nOf love with a man\n\nWho later may claim (Later may claim)\n\nThat I led him astray (Led him astray)\n\nBut truly, one day\n\nI hope he turns out okay\n\nIn his own private way\n\n\n\nShould I have hung on?\n\nShould I have hung on?\n\nShould I have hung on to you?\n\nShould I have hung on?\n\nOh\n\nShould I have hung on to you?\n\nOh-oh",
