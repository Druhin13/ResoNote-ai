  "lyrics": "Right now, the music travels through cabels\r\nLike black magic miracles\r\nThe dancers have gathered into an army of angels\r\nRight now, the night air crackles with live electricity\r\nThe stars sparkle, like shattered glass\r\nAll we've got is this precious moment\n\nTake my hand, we can rescue each other",
