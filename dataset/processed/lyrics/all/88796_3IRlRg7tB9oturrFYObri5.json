  "lyrics": "There I was on death row\r\nGuilty in the first degree\r\nSon of God hanging on a hill\r\nHell was my destiny\r\nThe crowd was shouting crucify\n\nCould've come from these lips of mine\n\nThe dirty shame was killing me\n\nIt would take a miracle to wash me clean\n\n\n\nThen I read the red letters\n\nAnd the ground began to shake\n\nThe prison walls started falling\n\nAnd I became a free man that day\n\n\n\nFelt like lightning hit my veins\n\nMy dead heart began to beat\n\nBreath of God filled my lungs\n\nAnd the Holy Ghost awakened me\n\nYeah, the Holy Ghost awakened me\n\n\n\nWhen I read the red letters\n\nAnd the ground began to shake\n\nThe prison walls started falling\n\nAnd I became a free man that day\n\n\n\nFor God so loved the whole wide world\n\nSent His only Son to die for me\n\nArms spread wide for the whole wide world\n\nHis arms spread wide where mine should be\n\nJesus changed my destiny\n\n\n\nThank You, God, for red letters\n\nWhen the ground began to shake\n\nThe grace of God started falling\n\nAnd I became a free man that day\n\nThe prison walls started falling\n\nAnd I am a free manâ€¦ today",
