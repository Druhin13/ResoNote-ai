  "lyrics": "Down on the corner of ruin and grace\r\nI'm growin weary of the human race\r\nHold my lamp up in everyone's face\r\nLookin for an honest man\r\nEveryone tied to the turnin wheel\r\nEveryone hidin from the things they feel\n\nWell the truth's so hard it just don't seem real\n\nThe shadow across this land\n\n\n\nPeople round here don't know what it means\n\nTo suffer at the hands of our american dreams\n\nThey turn their backs on the grisly scenes\n\nTraced to the privileged sons\n\nThey got their god they got their guns\n\nGot their armies and the chosen ones\n\nBut we'll all be burnin in the same big sun\n\nWhen the great correction comes\n\n\n\nDown through the ages lovers of the mystery\n\nBeen sayin people let your love light shine\n\nPoets and sages all throughout history\n\nSay the light burns brightest in the darkest times\n\n\n\nIt's the bitter end we've come down to\n\nThe eye of the needle that we gotta get through\n\nBut the end could be the start of something new\n\nWhen the great correction comes\n\n\n\nDown through the ages lovers of the mystery\n\nBeen sayin people let your love light shine\n\nPoets and sages all throughout history\n\nSay the light burns brightest in the darkest times\n\n\n\nDown to the wire runnin out of time\n\nStill got hope in this heart of mine\n\nBut the future waits on the horizon line\n\nFor our daughters and our sons\n\nI don't know where this train's bound\n\nWhole lotta people tryin to turn it around\n\nGonna shout til the walls come tumblin down\n\nAnd the great correction comes",
