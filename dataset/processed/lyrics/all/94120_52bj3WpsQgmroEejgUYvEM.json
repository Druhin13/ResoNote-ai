  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Sad Rappers par Tom MacDonald\r\nWhere'd all these suicidal sad rappers come from?\nThey showed up with those mumble rapper dum-dums\nThey been prayin' on people with mental illness\nAnd pretendin' to relate to get paid and create a business\nThey claim to be anxious, say they're depressed\nThey fakin' it to gain somethin' in common with some fans for a check\nIt's over-diagnosed so it's becomin' a trend\nTo say that you're crazy, or insane, or that you're sick in the head\nThey romanticize the mental pain, we're barely survivin'\nAnd then they glorify the men and women losin' their lives\nI'm talkin' Cobain, Lil Peep, Winehouse, Jackson, Williams, Cornell, Bennington\n\nImagine all the icons that we buried, prolly turnin' in their grave\nSo they can witness how this sickness is gettin' used to get paid\nThese rappers fabricating symptoms for fame\nTheir mental illness is the money on their mind\nIt started rottin' they brains, yeah\n\nY'all ain't real from the chains to the gear to the grills\nNow it's pain, talkin' tears, takin' pills\nY'all ain't real, I can see it in your eyes, all lies\nY'all guys don't know how we feel\nY'all ain't real enough to deal with us\nTo feel the love, nah nah nah nah\nY'all just make believe, you claim to be\nThe same as me, nah nah nah-nah\n\n\nPeople die from depression, these rappers cry for attention\nAnd it's in every single genre you can possibly mention\nFrom pop to electronic to rock to indie to grunge\nThey're tryin' to hook you in to usin' the music like it's a drug\nGet you addicted to artists, they're manufactured to target\nAll of people in therapy tryin' to deal with their hardships\nCrafted and marketed 'til they had you convinced\nThat if you followed that person they'll make you fight in your skin\nThey ain't really tryin' help you, they don't wanna make you better\nIt's a lie they're tryna sell you so you always buy their records\n\nIf you wanna know the truth they want you strugglin' forever\nSo you look to them for answers with your Visa or your debit\nIt's like the record labels workin' for pharma\nThey made anxiety trendy by usin' popular artists\nThen use the rappers to promote prescription pills to their audience\nThey created the problem to sell you pills that would solve 'em\nIt's brilliant\n\nY'all ain't real from the chains to the gear to the grills\nNow it's pain, talkin' tears, takin' pills\nY'all ain't real, I can see it in your eyes, all lies\nY'all guys don't know how we feel\n\nY'all ain't real enough to deal with us\nTo feel the love, nah nah nah nah\nY'all just make believe, you claim to be\nThe same as me, nah nah nah-nah\n\nExploiting our problems to benefit\nThey just wanna get paid\nI spent all my money on medicine\nSpend all your money on chains\nY'all just exploiting the misery\nPoppin' Xannies to fade\nWell I'm throwin' ones into therapy\n'Cause all I know is rain\n\nY'all ain't real from the chains to the gear to the grills\nNow it's pain, talkin' tears, takin' pills\nY'all ain't real, I can see it in your eyes, all lies\n\nY'all guys don't know how we feel\nY'all ain't real enough to deal with us\nTo feel the love, nah nah nah nah\nY'all just make believe, you claim to be\nThe same as me, nah nah nah-nah\n\nY'all ain't real from the chains to the gear to the grills\nNow it's pain, talkin' tears, takin' pills\nY'all ain't real, I can see it in your eyes, all lies\nY'all guys don't know how we feel\nY'all ain't real enough to deal with us\nTo feel the love, nah nah nah nah\nY'all just make believe, you claim to be\nThe same as me, nah nah nah-nah",
