  "lyrics": "Her memory used to kill me, but I found a remedy\r\nIt's a plastic cup with domestic draft and I start with two or three\r\nAnd when the floodgates of emotion, they slowly start to crack\r\nI mix it tall with something strong 'til I don't want her back\r\nHit me with a shot from the top shelf\n\nI'm pouring out all of my pain\n\nI'm starting to think I'm getting good at this\n\nThe more I feel the better I drink\n\nDrink, drink, line 'em up, honey\n\nI got a tab and a pocket full of money\n\nGonna drown my heart in a whiskey rain\n\nThe more I feel the better I drink\n\n\n\nBartender, here's my license, go ahead and take my keys\n\n'Cause it's a backsliding to missing her night and you know my routine, just\n\n\n\nHit me with a shot from the top shelf\n\nI'm pouring out all of my pain\n\nI'm starting to think I'm getting good at this\n\nThe more I feel the better I drink\n\nDrink, drink, line 'em up, honey\n\nI got a tab and a pocket full of money\n\nGonna drown my heart in a whiskey rain\n\nThe more I feel the better I drink\n\n\n\nI'm on that premium, no need for a chaser after\n\nThe bartender's looking for a stepladder\n\nBottles so high, I can't read the labels\n\nDo yourself a favor man, just leave it on the table\n\nOn a roll, ain't stopping til the night is over\n\nA hundred dollar shot makes a thousand dollar hangover\n\nThey say, you can't put a price on love\n\nBut there's a price on bourbon so it's close enough\n\n\n\nHit me with a shot from the top shelf\n\nI'm pouring out all of my pain\n\nI'm starting to think I'm getting good at this\n\nThe more I feel the better I drink\n\nDrink, drink, line 'em up, honey\n\nI got a tab and a pocket full of money\n\nGonna drown my heart in a whiskey rain\n\nThe more I feel the better I drink",
