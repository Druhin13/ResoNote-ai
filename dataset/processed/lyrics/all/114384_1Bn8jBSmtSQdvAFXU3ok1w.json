  "lyrics": "Big old whiskey on them icy rocks\r\nFlood down some veins like oxy does\r\nI need fresh air, I need oxygen\r\nWho the hell you foolin'? It's so obvious\r\nI don't feel it, I don't see it, this is nice for me\r\nI can't help but feel like you is after me\n\nIs you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?\n\nThere's a party outside, 'til the morning gone come\n\nIs you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?\n\nThere's a party outside, know the night is young\n\nIs you having fun?\n\n\n\nSay we should just, say we should just, pray to work again\n\nPuttin' diamonds on my back, puttin' diamonds on my back\n\nSay we should just, say we should just, pray to work again\n\nPuttin' diamonds on my back, puttin' diamonds on my back\n\n\n\nBut you know if I waste my time\n\nTalking 'bout what ain't mine\n\nAnd you know I'll be theirs tonight\n\nJust like last, last night\n\n\n\nI said, I said\n\nWho that, who that, who that, who that\n\nLooking in the shadows\n\nTryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows\n\nThey wanna blackball me, but I hold my avocados\n\nThen they melt down like the hash, we mix 'em like tobacco\n\nCircle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol\n\nYou'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco\n\nCould be stronger than vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile\n\nGrapple with reality to break out of these shackles\n\n\n\nBut you know if I waste my time\n\nTalking 'bout what ain't mine\n\nAnd you know I'll be their's tonight\n\nJust like last, last night\n\n\n\nSuicidal thoughts, but I won't do it\n\nTake that how you want, it's important I admit it\n\nI'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it\n\nMaybe codependent, can't tell the difference\n\nWhen the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break\n\nBut something's gotta give, ain't that what you say\n\nWhen you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made\n\nI should have made, they're not the same, I'm not the same\n\nMaybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely\n\nI know it's not healthy, appreciate your patience\n\nI know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless\n\nI know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing\n\n\n\nI want more out of life than this\n\nI want more, I want more\n\nI want more out of life than this\n\nI want more, I want more\n\nI want more out of life than this\n\nI want more, I want more\n\nI want more out of life than this\n\nI want more, I want more\n\n\n\nI want more out of life than this\n\nI want more, I want more\n\nI want more out of life than this\n\nI want more, I want more",
