  "lyrics": "Everyone's time's gonna fade away\r\nDust to dust and Amazing Grace\r\nOnly thing I'm leaving is my last name\r\nOh, and an empty grave\r\nOne day I'll be in a box I ain't talkin' about a grave\n\nI'm talkin' 'bout a box of greatest hits I made along the way\n\nFound on a dirt road 'cause I ain't never had shit paved\n\nAnd when the roots grow back I'll be a mystery per se\n\nNo askin' folks in Nashville 'cause I refuse to go and sign\n\nWalked in houses of legends that made a impact on your life\n\nTakin' advice from people who have platinum records with Slim Shady\n\nWent on vacation with country superstars even though I'm crazy\n\nAnd on a psycho social roller coaster, no seat belts doin' loops\n\nMy mind got a vault like a doomsday preppin' loony toon\n\nStay boucin' off my walls like my house is made of gymnastic mats\n\nAnd I'll be rappin' 'til I'm 90 out of shape with cataracts\n\n'Cause I ain't got to see a rope to cut a trail and make a path\n\nI'm 27 and I know this whole city feelin' my wrath\n\nJust wait 'til I'm 30 and fine tuned like a Stratocaster\n\nI'm not biodegradable still the cleanest white trash and I'm Church\n\n\n\nEveryone's time's gonna fade away\n\nDust to dust and Amazing Grace\n\nOnly thing I'm leaving is my last name\n\nOh, and an empty grave\n\n\n\nMost people in denial about the timeline of life\n\nThe burnin' of a flame one goes out then one goes up and strikes\n\nI stepped into the shallow water knowin' one day I'll drown\n\nTo the noise of screamin' voices and Instagram shutter sounds\n\nRight now for me it's just now, startin' to get kinda loud\n\nI'm gettin' pointed out in malls from a couple surroundin' crowds\n\nPeople threatin' to jump me and want to show up to my house\n\nYou're creatin' a crazy person with loaded guns in his house\n\nAnd everyday that passes I'm becomin' more intelligent to social negligence\n\nNo matter what the cadence is all I see is some adjectives\n\nI'm drastically paintin' you cinematic action\n\nMixed with words I scrambled off of every part of the alphabet\n\nHow gooder can I get I think the game is hibernatin'\n\nOr overdosed on manufactured faces and sound waves\n\nSo won't you put me in that box and put my voice in one that's separate\n\nOne's a death box the other's gonna be a livin' statement and they know it\n\n\n\nEveryone's time's gonna fade away\n\nDust to dust and Amazing Grace\n\nOnly thing I'm leaving is my last name\n\nOh, and an empty grave\n\n\n\nKnock knock who's there, it's the end of your career\n\nYeah what's up you motherfucker been waitin' to see you here\n\nI've been dyin' to meet you and that's really no pun intended\n\nI've met every goal I wanted made the impact for my people\n\nAnd held them southern roots before every song that I made\n\nAnd got invited to show up and attend the CMA'S\n\nBut my ass never went I went ghost when they called me to that stage\n\n'Cause I don't need people to clap to make me proud of my name\n\nTo make me proud of my songs, to make me proud of my lyrics\n\nI was built out of southern spirit only found in the thicket\n\nMy bloodline the thickest, fuck all the fame and the riches\n\nThat shit all fades away but not the voice of a legend who's preachin'\n\nAnd that's why they call me Church, cross my heart hope to die\n\nStick a needle in my eye, and have to do it three times\n\nTo even almost make me blind, 'cause my third one don't even blink\n\nSo I see you before you see yourself when you try comin' for me\n\nChurch\n\n\n\nEveryone's time's gonna fade away\n\nDust to dust and Amazing Grace\n\nOnly thing I'm leaving is my last name\n\nOh, and an empty grave",
