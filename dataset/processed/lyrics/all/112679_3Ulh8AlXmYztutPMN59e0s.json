  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Rolling Papers 2 par Wiz Khalifa\r\nNigga, my motherfucker's life depends on this shit\nDo this shit for my son\nTurn me up\nSo I can hear myself a little more in the headphones\n\nCame from the bottom, started this out with nothing\nTurned the fam in my squad, and turn this thing into something\nI grab a cone and I stuff it, never gonna get enough\nDepending on how its going, we only gonna get tougher\nI done seen people suffer, hate turned into love\n\nLost some people to get here\nBut they watching us from up above\nOn the road, hardly ever home\nAnd money caught one in the dome\nNow its hard to even pick up my phone\nLeave me alone, I'll be in my zone\nI'm getting grown but not too grown to let my feelings show\nAnything you want, you can get, you gotta build it tho\nI blew up quick and lost some shit\nBut now I'm dealing those\nThere's consequences to every decisions\nGood or wrong, just do the best with time you're given and live strong\nGive your all 'cause a man gon' be a man\nAnd do what he gotta do\nBaby, this is rolling papers two\n\n(This is rolling papers two)\n(This is rolling papers two)\n\nImma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it\nWhen it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it\n(Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it\nWhen it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it)\n\nYeah, all of the fame just comes with the game\nIt's a gift and the curse when everybody know your name\nHow do you make a million dollars and still stay the same\nHow do you make a hundred millions and still sane\nYou got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls\n\nTrying to do better, but all the shit in the world\nSomething regular would you prefer?\nBut it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve\nOn the verge, packing up and going back to where I came from\nTired of these rappers, I only run in the lane once\nTired of all these girls, we all fucking the same ones\nI ain't giving chances no more, I already gave one\nGetting money, you better save some\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes 'cause you gotta make some\nIt takes time, but a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do\n\nBaby, this is rolling papers two\n(This is rolling papers two)\n(This is rolling papers two)\n\nImma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it\nWhen it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it\n(Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it\nWhen it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it)\n\nNo turning back, I'm learning that\nIf you ever show someone love, you deseves it back\nIf you got a ounces of paper, you should burn it back\nAnd if you ever do takes a loss, you can earn it back\n\nNever slack, never overreact, let your money stack\nLook at where you're going and where you at\nYou gon get there if you work hard\nWhen you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for\nI want more, couple cars in my garage\nAnd mansions with marble floors\nAbove it all, open my doors\nCouple plaques on the wall\nHoop court where my friends could ball\nIt may sounds strange but Imma need it all\nWhen I spend some afar, I hit the road when I get the car\nGot some family members that I don't see at all\nIt pays off 'cause a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do\nBaby, this is rolling papers two\n\n(This is rolling papers two)\n(This is rolling papers two)\n\nImma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it\nWhen it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it\n(Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it\nWhen it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it)",
