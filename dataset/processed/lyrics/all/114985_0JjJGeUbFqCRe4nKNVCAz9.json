  "lyrics": "Never have I ever been someone who's had it all\r\nLike not at all, yeah\r\nAnd on occasion I could think too much\r\nI get uncomfortable, hide behind my walls\r\nAnd I talk in circles\r\nBut at least I say what I mean\n\nAnd I rock my heart on the sleeve of my t-shirt\n\n\n\nSo if I should die tomorrow, I'd die with all of me on me\n\nAnd if I give back the time that I've borrowed\n\nI know I gave everything, everything\n\n\n\nAnd no, you won't\n\nNo, you won't forget, forget me no\n\nNo, you won't\n\nNo, you won't forget, forget this girl next door\n\n\n\nNo, no, no, no\n\nNever have I ever met someone who worries like I do\n\nThat's nothing new, yeah\n\nAnd I don't really like to get dressed up\n\nWhat's it to you? I know what I can do\n\nAnd I'm not Bowie, Prince or Queen\n\nBut at least I do what I dream\n\nAnd I rock my soul on both sleeves of my t-shirt\n\n\n\nSo if I should die tomorrow, I'd die with all of me on me\n\nAnd if I give back the time that I've borrowed\n\nI know I gave everything, everything\n\n\n\nAnd no, you won't\n\nNo, you won't forget, forget me no\n\nNo, you won't\n\nNo, you won't forget, forget this girl next door\n\n\n\nAnd I may not've been a genius\n\nI'm just a girl with some reasons to stay Plain Jane\n\nBut I won't go, do you hear me?\n\nI'll be sure not to leave 'fore you know my name\n\n\n\nIf I should die tomorrow, I'd die with all of me\n\nAnd if I give back the time that I've borrowed\n\nI know I gave everything\n\n\n\nAnd no, you won't (You won't)\n\nNo, you won't (You won't) forget (Forget), forget me no\n\nNo, you won't (You won't)\n\nNo, you won't (You won't) forget, forget this girl next door",
