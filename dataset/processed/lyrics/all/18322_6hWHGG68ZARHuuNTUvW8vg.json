  "lyrics": "Born from fumes\r\nAnd built from the inside\r\nI roll my eyes to the back of my head\r\nMy salvation is dead\r\nBlood enters in\r\nVentilation for my skin\n\n\n\nI can feel the dirt it runs through my veins\n\nI enter eternal pain\n\nMy life is yours to gain\n\nAnd It turns me inside out\n\n\n\nI contort and dance you just sound deranged\n\nIts human nature to stay the same\n\nI laugh and I shake from the heat here\n\nLet me tell you about pain\n\n\n\nI do the devil's dance\n\nAnd it's all in my head\n\nMy blood is cold and I'm painted in red\n\nI'd crush my empty skull if it meant no pain\n\nI'll stay hidden underwater ‘til I go insane\n\n\n\nDoes this happen to you or just me?\n\nIf so let me see\n\nLet me in\n\nLet me see\n\nLet me see\n\n\n\nI had to learn how to adapt\n\nWith my eyes pushed out\n\nAnd my hands held behind my back\n\n\n\nOh hunters I can be your prey\n\nJust promise me you'll stay\n\nIf I listened to you I wouldn't be the same\n\nWatch as I put myself in the flame\n\n\n\nI still hear it ring in my ears\n\nAll this pain has brought me to tears\n\nI'm not ready to fight but you should\n\nDon't complain when I stand where you should\n\n\n\nLike a trance\n\nI move with your voice\n\nUnder chants of horror around me\n\nAnd I think to myself what a life\n\nWhy be here if I’m going to die",
