  "lyrics": "Now look and listen as you walk around\r\nAnd you'll hear voices on the wind\r\nThose lonely whispers from this hallowed ground\r\nJust take your time as they begin\r\nAs the sun goes down\n\nThe silence is profound\n\nFor they gave so much\n\nSo we might go on and live\n\nLaying peaceful they forgive\n\n\n\nIn the sea of red\n\nThere are stories to be told\n\nAs the years go by\n\nAll the memories unfold\n\nBow your head\n\n\n\nIn fields of wonder where those swallows soar\n\nOur hearts are weary as we pray\n\nThe grass is greener from the tears that fall\n\nFor you on this remembrance day\n\n\n\nYour message has been heard\n\nWords of wisdom have been shared\n\nTheir despair won't matter as they rise above\n\nThere is no end to love\n\n\n\nIn the sea of red\n\nThere are stories to be told\n\nAs the years go by\n\nAll the memories unfold\n\nBow your head\n\nSea of red\n\n\n\nFrom this earth take wing\n\nShine down from the sky\n\nWe see you as you fly\n\n\n\nIn the sea of red\n\nThere are stories to be told\n\nAs the years go by\n\nAll the memories unfold\n\nBow your head\n\nSea of red\n\n\n\nOn the sea of red\n\nWhere the glory has no end\n\nThere's a place for us\n\nAs our lives begin again\n\nBow your head\n\nSea of red",
