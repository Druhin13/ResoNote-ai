  "lyrics": "Can you understand me\r\nBaby, don't you hand me a line\r\nAlthough it doesn't matter\r\nYou and me got plenty of time\r\nThere's nobody in the future\r\nSo baby let me hand you my love\n\nThere's no step for you to dance to\n\nSo slip your hand inside of my glove\n\nHold me, hold me, hold me\n\nHold me, hold me, hold me\n\nI don't want no damage\n\nBut how'm I gonna manage with you\n\nYou hold the percentage\n\nBut I'm the fool payin' the dues\n\nI'm just around the corner\n\nIf you got a minute to spare\n\nI'll be waitin' for you\n\nIf you ever wanna be there\n\nHold me, hold me, hold me\n\nHold me, hold me, hold me",
