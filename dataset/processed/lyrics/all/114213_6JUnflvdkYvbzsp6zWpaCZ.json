  "lyrics": "Oh yeah\r\nCandles burning low, lots of mistletoe\r\nLots of snow and ice everywhere we go\r\nChoirs singing carols right outside my door\r\nAll these things and more (All these things and more, my baby)\n\nThat's what Christmas means to me, my love\n\n(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)\n\nAh yeah\n\n\n\nAnd ya know what I mean\n\nI see your smiling face like I've never seen before\n\nEven though I love ya madly, it seems I love you more\n\nAnd the little thoughts you give me touch my heart for sure\n\n\n\nOh, all these things and more\n\n(All these things and more, my darling)\n\nThat's what Christmas means to me, my love\n\n(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)\n\nAh yeah\n\n\n\nI feel like running wild, I feel just like a little child\n\nBring you 'neath the mistletoe\n\nI kiss you once, and then some more\n\nWish you a merry Christmas, baby\n\n(Wish you a merry Christmas, baby)\n\nAnd such happiness in the coming year, oh\n\n(Happiness in the coming year)\n\nLet's deck the halls with holly, singing \"Silent Night\"\n\nDress the trees with angel hair, and pretty, pretty lights\n\nGo to sleep and wake up just before daylight\n\n\n\nOh, all these things and more, darling\n\n(All these things and more, my darling)\n\nThat's what Christmas means to me, my love\n\n(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)\n\nOh yeah, yeah",
