  "lyrics": "I got some poison on the brain\r\nAnd I’m not scared I’m not ashamed\r\nNo more of anything, anything, anything but the rain\r\nIt melts my smile straight down the drain\r\nI found black magic and white shame\r\nAnd I lost everything, everything, everything but the pain\n\n\n\nI set my alarm for an early start that I slept through\n\nI’ve torn apart all chances of stealing your heart\n\nThat sunless morning\n\nI got my start on the mean streets\n\nWhere Demon and Division meet\n\nBeen dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning\n\n\n\nNow I have violence on the brain\n\nYou’re not in love you’re just insane\n\nAfraid of everything, everything, everything and the shame\n\nIt wipes that smile right off your face\n\nLost in confusion and disgrace\n\nI once had everything, everything, everything but you\n\n\n\nI set my alarm for an early start that I slept through\n\nI’ve torn apart all chances of stealing your heart\n\nThat sunless morning\n\nI got my start on the mean streets\n\nWhere Demon and Division meet\n\nBeen dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning\n\n\n\nJaw dropped, here in shock on the icy streets (You’re Killing)\n\nAll the alcohol in hell and I just watched it freeze (You’re Killing)\n\nNow I’ll skate on through\n\n\n\nSi tu veux\n\nHave it, I’m finished\n\n\n\nI’m getting out, set the clock for an early start\n\nDodged a bullet, saw my shadow get blown apart\n\nI won’t apologize\n\n\n\nYou are killing me\n\n\n\nI set my alarm for an early start that I slept through\n\nI’ve torn apart all chances of stealing your heart\n\nThat sunless morning\n\nI got my start on the mean streets\n\nWhere Demon and Division meet\n\nBeen dodging bullets and dirty looks all fucking morning\n\nI got some poison on the brain",
