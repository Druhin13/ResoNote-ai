Tell me what's it all for?\r\nWhat's it all for? Yea\n\n\n\nCrosses get thrown\n\nCliques get torn apart before they even really start gettin' on\n\nSmall change stayin' in the way of big money\n\nSmoke some with your OG, learn something\n\nWrist froze my soul ice cold, arm yellow gold\n\nAnd cashed out a couple kilos, cut my grass low\n\nBuilt my fence high 'cause I that heard snakes fly\n\nShut your operation down from the inside\n\nGet tapped in the wire before you realize\n\nTrappin' lied, scrammin' for dollar signs\n\nYou gamble with your life only could lose, one time\n\nShit, is it all worth the risk?\n\nGotta decide before you step into this, huh\n\nBecause the game don't wait, sideways\n\nBurnin' rubber 'cause a nigga paper straight\n\nI got some money put away and got some more on the way, shit\n\n\n\nWhat's it all for? What's it all for, all for\n\nMoney and the power, what's it all for?\n\nSleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?\n\nWhat's it all for? What's it all for, all for\n\nMoney and the power, what's it all for?\n\nSleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?\n\n\n\nTell you how dollars start a world war\n\nLevel 6 Benz coupe, armored car\n\nI really been mashin' down the Audubon\n\nWorldwide gettin' all the Parmesan\n\nSmokin' in the pool with my diamonds on\n\nIce water, what you call it though\n\nShe jumped in with nothing on\n\nShe know what she want\n\n\n\nWhat's it all for? What's it all for, all for\n\nMoney and the power, what's it all for?\n\nSleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?\n\nWhat's it all for? What's it all for, all for\n\nMoney and the power, what's it all for?\n\nSleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?\n\n\n\nTell me what's it, what's it all for?\n\nTell me what's it, what's it all for?\n\nWhat's it all for? What's it all for?\n\nWhat's it all for? What's it all for?\n\nMoney and the power, what's it all for?\n\nSleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?\n\nShow you how dollars start a world war\n\nLevel 6 Benz coupe, armored car\n\nI really been mashin' down the Audubon",
