  "lyrics": "When I was young I spoke like a child, and I saw with a child's eyes\r\nAnd an open door was to a girl like the stars are to the sky\r\nIt's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations\r\nWith adventures for the stout of heart, and the lure of the open spaces\r\nThere's 2 lanes running down this road, whichever side you're on\n\nAccounts for where you want to go, or what you're running from\n\nBack when darkness overtook me on a blind man's curve\n\n\n\nI relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon\n\nI relied upon the moon and Saint Christopher \n\nNow I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes\n\nFor being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times\n\n\n\nNow I've paid my dues cuz I have owed them, but I've paid a price sometimes\n\nFor being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times\n\nNow I have run from the arms of lovers, I've run from the eyes of friends\n\nI have run from the hands of kindness, I've run just because I can\n\n\n\nBut now I'm grown and I speak like a woman and I see with a woman's eyes\n\nAnd an open door is to me now like the saddest of goodbyes\n\nIt's too late for turning back, I pray for the heart and the nerve\n\n\n\nAnd I rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon\n\nI rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher\n\n\n\nI rely upon the moon, I rely upon the moon\n\nI rely upon the moon and Saint Christopher",
