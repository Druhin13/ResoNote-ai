  "lyrics": "No body, so no shadows where I stand\r\nDifferent kind of blood, in my mouth is a gem\r\nI'm more than man\r\nIn my heart and eyes, there's a pain\r\nTension's building in these bands again\r\nIt's official\n\nYou're listening to Wicca Phase Springs Eternal\n\nGothBoiClique\n\n\n\nEsoteric god, Aramaic texts\n\nLighting candles up\n\nMake a pact while you light another cigarette\n\nShadows cast on walls\n\nI project my second body as a silhouette\n\n\n\nI reach out to her and I call her by her name\n\nCorinthiax, I'll see you soon\n\nThe dark manifestation\n\nOf a love that I was given\n\nFrom a hollow moon\n\nShe said she's a bad one, always on attack, now I call for you\n\nGothBoiClique\n\nEven though these feelings come in waves\n\nStemmed from sacred texts\n\nI reach out to her and I call her by her name\n\nCorinthiax, Corinthiax\n\nYes, she is a bad one, but I got her back\n\nCorinthiax, Corinthiax\n\nI call out to her, she tenses up and retracts\n\nCorinthiax, Corinthiax\n\nYes, she is a bad one, but I got her back",
