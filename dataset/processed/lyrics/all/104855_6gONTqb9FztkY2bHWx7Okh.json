  "lyrics": "I wrote this one when I was still alive\r\nHey You, yeah you, Listen\r\nAnd if I had a horse\r\nTo climb up and ride off to the warmth\r\nI'd never turn around I'd just Kick up this dust\r\nTill I find where I'm found\n\nAnd If I qualified as a genius\n\nMaybe I'd live out my dreams and die dreamless\n\nThese voices in my life are all make believe\n\nTrying to find a way to exploit my choice of pain relief\n\n\n\nIt doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly\n\nAnd when they come to divide we got to multiply\n\nYou make me want to understand your graffiti\n\nYou're trying to make me feel like somebody needs me\n\n\n\nI'm examining the clouds like I'm looking for a sign\n\nI hope you're having a - good time\n\nIf you wasn't afraid would you lie so much\n\nYou got your tail between your legs chasing fire trucks\n\nYou can tell I'm not the best at expressing how I felt\n\nThat's why I hide it inside the words I spell\n\nI mix the medication, it fixes whatever ails them\n\nAnd now she treats me like a snake oil salesman\n\nWell thank you for your vote of confidence\n\nI don't give a shit about how it figures into all your politics\n\nStill believe you gotta make your art, play your part\n\nThe world waits for you to break my patient heart\n\nNow let me find a road by the airport\n\nTo park and watch the planes arrive and think of what I'm here for\n\nAnd I ain't trying to kill the vibe\n\nBut I'm grateful that you're still alive\n\nNow gimme a High-Five!\n\n\n\nIt doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly\n\nAnd when they come to divide we got to multiply\n\nYou make me want to understand your graffiti\n\nYou're trying to make me feel like somebody needs me\n\n\n\nAnd that's what we supposed to do I guess\n\nSpread love till you've used your last breath\n\nNo matter what the challenges hold, I was bold\n\nCause I knew that we could handle the cold\n\nAnd just in case I don't say this enough\n\nThanks for the love, I love the way that you love\n\nAnd I ain't making this up\n\nYou put some change in my cup\n\nAnd then you gave me a hug\n\nIt's like you came from above\n\n\n\nIt doesn't really go very high if it was born to fly\n\nAnd when they come to divide we got to multiply\n\nYou make me want to understand your graffiti\n\nYou're trying to make me feel like somebody needs me",
