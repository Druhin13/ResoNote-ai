  "lyrics": "In the car, windows down\r\nDrove just to hear the sound\r\nIn my head, what I found\r\nIs all too familiar now\r\nAnd I'm losing sleep love\n\nOver all these simple things still I'm\n\n\n\nHolding on to your old sweatshirt\n\nThe black one with the cigarette burns\n\nIt smells like your perfume\n\nThere's always a part of me thats holding on to your\n\nDeep green eyes and how they looked at mine\n\nPolaroids of all those summer nights\n\nDo you think of me too\n\nThere's always a part of me that's holding on to you\n\n\n\nIn my sight, out of reach\n\nClose enough to hear you breathe\n\nFeel the rush over me\n\nWith every single word you speak\n\n\n\nAnd I'm losing sleep love\n\nOver all these simple things still I'm\n\n\n\nHolding on to your old sweatshirt\n\nThe black one with the cigarette burns\n\nIt smells like your perfume\n\nThere's always a part of me thats holding on to your\n\nDeep green eyes and how they looked at mine\n\nPolaroids of all those summer nights\n\nDo you think of me too\n\nThere's always a part of me that's holding on to you",
