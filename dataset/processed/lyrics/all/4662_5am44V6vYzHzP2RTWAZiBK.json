  "lyrics": "Here and then you're gone\r\nYeah, Houston loves some\r\nUsed to run around\r\nWith the vampires of the town\r\nBut I've seen them fade\r\nAnd I got to get away\n\n\n\nIn the years to come when you know that Houston loved me wrong\n\nPictures say to me\n\nPut his arms around me\n\nMy baby don't lie\n\nMy baby so true\n\n\n\nArm in arm\n\nWith Houston third\n\nKeep it low to the ground now\n\nAs you get to know the town\n\nCutie's mind is on fire\n\nShe had a spiritual good time\n\nShe's never been a good student\n\nShe's cute, cute\n\n\n\nMy baby don't lie\n\nDon't you know I'm in the mood?\n\nGonna do it to you, you, you, you, you\n\nCan you make it through December?\n\nAnd barely look up to you\n\nKeep it cool and calm\n\nKeep it going till it's done\n\nDrove on 4.2\n\nDrove his car through the city\n\n\n\nWell, can you do\n\nEvery thought you had was untrue\n\nBeen dreaming too long\n\nFell under the snow cloud\n\nPowerful two-chord blues\n\nComing through from me to you\n\n\n\nMaybe this is all\n\nLet's keep it short and sweet\n\nKeeping my brights on\n\nWe got miles to go",
