  "lyrics": "It's time to find a clearing\r\nTo wrestle in the dark\r\nThe maze among the lights\r\nSee the nodes that emerge in the face\r\nIt's tie to quit the race\n\nTo carry nothing forward\n\nFor we owe it to ourselves\n\nTo bury yesterday, leave it quaking in the earth\n\n\n\nIf we don't know what we're speaking\n\nAnd we are not who we've been\n\nThere's a chance we're only waking\n\nFrom a dream of the god in our breast\n\n\n\nHow will we be in that waking?\n\nHow will we be in the womb?\n\nWe may all begin aquatic\n\nBut we leave only dust from our bones\n\n\n\nYou won't find me where I fall\n\nYou won't find me where I fall\n\nWe may all begin aquatic\n\nBut we leave through the fire for our homes",
