  "lyrics": "I think about you when I go to New York\r\nI think about you when I brush my teeth\r\nWhen I come home late and pass out on the floor\r\nI dream of you, dreaming of me\r\nAnd I know you know but I play it cool\n\nCause I hate to screw up good vibes like these\n\nAnd I you know you know but I thinking too much\n\nCause I hate to screw up good vibes like these\n\n\n\nGirl you really got me hooked on a feeling\n\nSo high, I hit the ceiling and I don't wanna come back down\n\nDo you feel it too? you Hooked on a feeling\n\nThis might just be the real thing and never come back down\n\nStay up with me, up with me\n\n\n\nDo you think about me out in California?\n\nDo you think about me when you comb your hair?\n\nWhen you're alone and passing out late night\n\nDo you wish I was there? I wish I was there\n\n\n\nAnd I know you know but I play it cool\n\nCause I hate to screw up good vibes like these\n\nAnd I you know you know but I thinking too much\n\nCause I hate to screw up good vibes like these\n\n\n\nGirl you really got me hooked on a feeling\n\nSo high, I hit the ceiling and I don't wanna come back down\n\nDo you feel it too? you Hooked on a feeling\n\nThis might just be the real thing and never come back down\n\nStay up with me, up with me\n\n\n\nWhen I hear that song I'm just thinkin' about you, yeah\n\nAlone in my room, tell me what could I do, yeah\n\nWhen I hear that song I'm just thinkin about you you\n\n\n\nGirl you really got me hooked on a feeling\n\nSo high, I hit the ceiling and I don't wanna come back down\n\nDo you feel it too? you Hooked on a feeling\n\nThis might just be the real thing and never come back down\n\nStay up with me, up with me",
