  "lyrics": "They say life will bring discomfort\r\nAnd I discovered, we all just suffer\r\n'Cause no one feels that bad\r\nAnd it comes from one another\r\nWe hurt each other, just like a lover\r\nAnd don't think twice 'bout that\n\nYeah and I feel like something's bad\n\nBut hell, I'm used to that\n\nI always turn my back, yeah\n\nAnd I wanna feel something\n\nBut all I feel is pain\n\nI wanna make a change bad\n\nYou either pick yourself up or you let yourself down\n\nLife will always be tough, so who the fuck are you now?\n\nWill you make it alone or do you need someone else?\n\nI don't need anyone, I'll do it all by myself\n\nI got scars, put up my guard\n\nI don't wanna get torn apart\n\nI start to feel my heart\n\nRace faster, it's pumping hard\n\nAnd all I want is to be something\n\nThat's why I just keep on running\n\nCan't stop what you don't see coming, yeah\n\nAnd you know I'm coming\n\nHow can I trust you, if you don't trust me?\n\nI do what I do, 'cause it is just me\n\nAnd nothing is new, no, I'm not lucky\n\nI work my ass off so I'll be something\n\nYou either pick yourself up or you let yourself down\n\nLife will always be tough, so, who the fuck are you now?\n\nWill you make it alone or do you need someone else?\n\nI don't need anyone, I'll do it all by myself",
