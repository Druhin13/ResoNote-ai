(Skrr)\n\nThat's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect\n\n\n\nGot a lot of blood and it's cold\n\nThey keep tryna get me for my soul\n\nThankful for the women that I know\n\nCan't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)\n\nEvery month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front\n\nShe gon' try and settle outta court and make a run\n\nThen gon' ask me how I'm doin'?\n\n\n\nI'm upset\n\nHalf a million on my head I can't accept, yeah\n\n'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah\n\nWant to waste a half a million, be my guest\n\nMade me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (skrr)\n\nBut I'm blessed, I just checked\n\nHate me, never met me in the flesh\n\nSaid she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect\n\nThat shit is in a box to the left, to the left\n\n\n\nGot a lot of blood and it's cold\n\nThey keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)\n\nThankful for the women that I know (that I know)\n\nCan't go fifty-fifty with no ho",
