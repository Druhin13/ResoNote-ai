  "lyrics": "I fall in love at least once every night\r\nAnother volume just keeps catching my eye\r\nI can keep picking one off every shelf\r\nI made a promise, it's one in and one out\r\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\n\n\nI'm breaking myself trying to get you in bed\n\nA million thoughts all racing around my head\n\nYou know I want you but I'm gripped by this doubt\n\nBorn on this promise, it's one in and one out\n\n\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\nThe was a lot I could have done\n\nBut nothing good\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\n\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you\n\nThe was a lot I could have done\n\nBut nothing good\n\nThat's why I stopped right where I stood\n\nWhen I saw you",
