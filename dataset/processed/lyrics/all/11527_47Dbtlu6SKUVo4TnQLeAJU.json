  "lyrics": "You always need a little pinch of pettiness in your pie\r\nYou always wear a little pretty petty dress and you lie\r\nTho we know karma doesn't taste so nice without drama, it's our favourite spice\r\nIf you wanna come and taste a slice of hardness\r\nSip on that petty float\r\nSlip on your petty coat\n\nThrow on your petty vest\n\nAnd a pinch of pettiness\n\nJust a pinch, of pettiness\n\nJust a pinch of pettiness\n\nPettiness",
