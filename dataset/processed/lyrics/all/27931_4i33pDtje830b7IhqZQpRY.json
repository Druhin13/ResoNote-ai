  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson A Thousand Miles par Damn Hot\r\nMaking my way downtown walking fast\nFaces pass and I'm home bound\nStaring blankly ahead just making my way\nMaking a way through the crowd\nAnd I need you\nAnd I miss you\nAnd now I wonder\nIf I could fall into the sky\nDo you think time would pass me by?\n'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles\nIf I could just see you tonight\nIt's always times like these when I think of you\nAnd I wonder if you ever think of me\n'Cause everything's so wrong and I don't belong\nLiving in your precious memories\n'Cause I'll need you\n\nAnd I'll miss you\nAnd now I wonder\nIf I could fall into the sky\nDo you think time would pass me by?\n'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles\nIf I could just see you tonight\nAnd I, I don't want to let you know\nI, I drown in your memory\nI, I don't want to let this go\nI, I don't\nMaking my way downtown walking fast\nFaces pass and I'm home bound\nStaring blankly ahead just making my way\nMaking a way through the crowd\nAnd I still need you\nAnd I still miss you\nAnd now I wonder\nIf I could fall into the sky\n\nDo you think time would pass us by?\n'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles\nIf I could just see you\nIf I could fall into the sky\nDo you think time would pass me by?\n'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles\nIf I could just see you, if I could just hold you tonight",
