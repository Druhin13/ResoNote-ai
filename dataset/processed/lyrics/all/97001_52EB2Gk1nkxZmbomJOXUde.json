  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Are You Lonely par Steve Aoki\r\nI know that you're calling me\nTo light up and let the shadow\nThat follows you underneath\nI know that you’re calling me\nI don't want to play it safe\n'Cause I don’t contend like that\nJust keep falling into me\nI know I got your back\n\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you\n\nWhoever said it was easy\nThey never know what we'd do\n\nOh, when these walls fall down\nI'll stand by you\nWhat you believe in\nI'll give it to you\n’Cause when these walls fall down\nI’ll stand by you\n\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\nI'll stand by you, I’ll stand by you\nAre you lonely? Are you lonely? Are you lonely?\nI'll stand by you, I'll stand by you",
