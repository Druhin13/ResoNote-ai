  "lyrics": "The sky opened up the day you were born\r\nI was so lost, broken and torn\r\nThere was no hope, no joy in my life\r\nEnded my darkness by bringing the light\r\nAs I fall through the flames\n\nNow you save me\n\n\n\nYou give me a reason to feel like I belong here\n\nI'll be building this house made of gold\n\nDarling have no fear\n\nYeah I pushed through the rain and the cold\n\nAnd forgot all the pain that I’ve known\n\nYeah, you give me a reason to feel like I belong here\n\nIn this house made of gold\n\n\n\nDaylight sent from the sky\n\nAnd burnt through the violence inside my mind\n\n(Your eyes, your eyes\n\nYour infinite eyes\n\nYour innocence shines\n\nMy shadows, they die)\n\nBold is the wandering soul\n\nOnce half a man, now my heart, my heart has gone cold\n\n(My heart, my heart\n\nYou'll never be alone\n\nA paradise found\n\nYou are my true love)\n\n\n\nAs I fall through the flames\n\nYeah, you saved me\n\n\n\nYou give me a reason to feel like I belong here\n\nI'll be building this house made of gold\n\nDarling have no fear\n\nYeah I pushed through the rain and the cold\n\nAnd forgot all the pain that I’ve known\n\nYeah you give me a reason to feel like I belong here\n\nIn this house made of gold\n\n\n\n\n\nYou give me a reason to feel like I belong here\n\nI'll be building this house made of gold\n\nDarling have no fear\n\nYeah I pushed through the rain and the cold\n\nAnd forgot all the pain that I've known\n\nYeah you give me a reason to feel like I belong here\n\nIn this house made of gold",
