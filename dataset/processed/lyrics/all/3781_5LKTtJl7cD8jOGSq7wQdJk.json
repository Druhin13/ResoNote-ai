  "lyrics": "I've been walking down by the river\r\nFor hours\r\nPast sailors, that house\r\nLess tattoos than the average teenager\r\nThere's a man fishing\r\nAnd selling what he catches\n\nA dollar a head\n\nI've been sitting near you\n\nFor a long tme now\n\nAnd he's yet to look over\n\nI have a strange feeling\n\nThat I know this man\n\nThat it's me\n\nI think it's me\n\n\n\nLet's try it\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nAm I invisible to you?\n\nOut of the blue now\n\nOut of the blue now\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nAm I invisible to you?\n\nGet in the mind shaft\n\n\n\nCan it be? Can it be?\n\nCan it be? Can it be?\n\nAh, Ah, Ah, Ah\n\n\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nGet in the mind shaft\n\nGet in the mind shaft\n\nCome inside\n\nCome inside\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nDeep inside me, now\n\n\n\nAh, Ah, Ah, Ah\n\n\n\nGet in the mind shaft\n\nCan you hear me now?",
