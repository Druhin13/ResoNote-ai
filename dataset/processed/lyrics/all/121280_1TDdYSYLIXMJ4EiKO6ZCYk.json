  "lyrics": "Countdown 'til you come off your rails\r\nAnd it ain't going well\r\nYou've been running up bills\r\nYou had to cancel your cards for shooting out street lamps while shooting at stars\r\nNow your credit is falling\n\nHeard it booming at parties, whispered in homes\n\nThe pundits on the radio won't leave it alone\n\nI heard it once, heard it twice\n\nHeard it well enough to tell\n\nThey say the Mission To Mars, is destined to fail now\n\n\n\nClimb down to the edge of your rope\n\nGot a letter 'bout a month ago from control\n\nThey say we're coming down hard\n\nWe locked our keys in our cars\n\nOr got booted at bars and now the movement is lost\n\n\n\nSo we blowing up God's phone\n\nPray he get us off hold soon\n\nBought our own space but our asses are frozen\n\nBlow enough smoke to punch a hole in the ozone\n\nAnd all you say is 'we should've stayed home'\n\n\n\nFading, faded, we never made it, faded\n\nTraded for your replacement\n\nFaded we never made it\n\nWatchu tryna be lately?\n\n\n\nClimb down to the edge your seat\n\nThey say that viewership for launch is up by 50 this week\n\nWe changed the format completely, cut the filler for meat\n\nIt's just blood on your TV making killings for free\n\nThe ticket lines are past the sign down at the end of the street\n\nMeet and greet, VIPs go a million a piece\n\nWe delayed the show for entry and so expired on the lease\n\nNow we're gonna re-release it, t.b.d\n\nChange the title to: Fuck You\n\nIt's what you want it to be\n\nWhen you know it only pay to make nice\n\nPack your shit and standby, please\n\nYour friends are trying to leave and get high\n\n\n\nCountdown 'til you come off your rails\n\nThey said the Mission To Mars is doing pretty well\n\nI heard it once, heard it twice, I heard everybody tell\n\nThey say the Mission To Mars is destined to sell out",
