  "lyrics": "I'm so alone\r\nBut all of my friends, but all of my friends, got some shit to do, yea\r\nAll of 'em got plans, I call 'em up, \"my bad,\" and text 'em\r\nThey never cross me like bad pedestrians\r\nI've been this awkward since adolescence\r\nI don't how long I had depression\n\nNever no peer-pressure, I'm tryna' get my little pecker\n\nOff in some girl I call my BFF, that ain't no secret kept\n\nI fucked then told my cousin, I'm broke, I wasn't buzzin'\n\nI tried to hit a few years, she wasn't budgin'\n\nI'm bogus, left my girl for some shawty\n\nSurely deservin' of all this lonely\n\n\"You sad? Tell me, how are you sad\n\nYou got all of these friends, you got all of these fans\"\n\nI ain't trust nobody new since 2012, I ain't let nobody in\n\nJesus got killed for our sins, Walter got killed for a coat\n\nI'm tryna' cope, but it's a part of me gone and apparently I'm alone\n\n\n\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\n\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\n\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\n\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\n\n\n\nI'm so alone\n\nJust me and my girl, she leave me for work, then leave me for school\n\nShe finally home, I leave her for tour\n\nFaceTiming nudity, yeah\n\nAll of this new to me, yeah\n\nAll of the infidelity when I was 17\n\nBeen catchin' up, I still feel like she catch me cheatin'\n\nNiggas askin' me how tour was\n\nKnowin' I been home like 2 months\n\nAnd I seen your ass like 2 times\n\nThey just small-talk like too damn no time, social interaction\n\nHave female friends I found attractive\n\nIf I tried to fuck, but I am no savage\n\nNow we don't speak, we just walk past\n\nIf my past could talk, it'd probably reply to the missed calls after all\n\n'Cause the friendships that I can't recall, done turned my heart into camouflage\n\nWhile the guys I used to play basketball with\n\nDoin' shit that I can't endorse\n\nNow with the Lord, now it really pours down\n\nWas alone then, still alone now\n\n\n\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\n\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe\n\nI'm havin' a busy day, I'll hit you back right away\n\nI seen that skies were grey, I hope to God you're safe",
