  "lyrics": "There's nothing for me here at home \nEverything I need is with you out east \nI can't wait any longer \nNo one seems to understand \nHow I long to be in the palm of your hand \nI can't wait anymore\n\n\n\nPale skin, a black bow in your hair \n\nI know that you're half crazy \n\nBut I don't care \n\n\n\nYou've got your bullfighter jacket on \n\nNothing beneath \n\nI had to take my mask off \n\nTo kiss you in the street \n\nSummer turns to fall \n\nMy head's up on your wall \n\n\n\nNothing seems to stay the same \n\nI'm terrified to lose you but more afraid to change \n\n\n\nSummer's here you're taking off your clothes \n\nTake my skin to add to your collection \n\n\n\nYou've got your bullfighter jacket on \n\nNothing beneath \n\nI had to take my mask off \n\nTo kiss you in the street \n\nSummer turns to fall \n\nMy head's up on your wall",
