  "lyrics": "Brown liquor in my hand, brown liquor in my blood\r\nDrinking on a mission, not afraid of love\r\nShe appeared like a vision, a dream in my head\r\nThe next thing I remember, I woke up in a hotel bed\r\nWe fell in love on whiskey, one shot at a time\n\nThat old Kentucky bourbon made her mine\n\nSometimes what you're drinkin' is best left on the vine\n\nWe fell in love on whiskey, fell apart on wine\n\n\n\nPerfume on the pillow but I can't recall her face\n\nShe did not leave a number, no she did not leave a trace\n\nThere's an empty red wine bottle sitting on a broken old TV\n\nBloodshot eyes in the mirror and they're staring back at me\n\n\n\nWe fell in love on whiskey, one shot at a time\n\nThat old Kentucky bourbon made her mine\n\nSometimes what you're drinkin' is best left on the vine\n\nWe fell in love on whiskey, fell apart on wine\n\n\n\nI got the shakes and a heartache brought on by alcohol\n\nI never saw her sober if she was ever real at all\n\nMy drunk imagination is a damn dark place to go\n\n'Cause I just sit here haunted, knowing that I'll never know\n\n\n\nWe fell in love on whiskey, one shot at a time\n\nThat old Kentucky bourbon made her mine\n\nYeah sometimes what you're drinkin' is best left on the vine\n\nWe fell in love on whiskey, fell apart on wine\n\nYeah we fell in love on whiskey, fell apart...\n\nFell apart on wine",
