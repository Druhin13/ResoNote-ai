  "lyrics": "Time flies by when the night is young\r\nDaylight shines on an undisclosed location, location\r\nBloodshot eyes lookin' for the sun\r\nParadise we live it, and we call it a vacation, vacation\r\nYou're painting me a dream that I\n\nWanna belong in, wanna belong in\n\n\n\nOver the hills and far away\n\nA million miles from L.A\n\nJust anywhere away with you\n\nI know we've got to get away\n\nSomeplace where no one knows our name\n\nWe'll find the start of something new\n\nJust take me anywhere, take me anywhere\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\n\n\nJust take me anywhere, take me anywhere\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\nFun, little less fun\n\nLittle less, over, over, over, over, me\n\nOh, fun, little less fun\n\nLittle less, over, over, over, over, me\n\n\n\nTruth comes out when we're blacking out\n\nLooking for connection in a crowd of empty faces, empty faces\n\nYour secrets are the only thing I'm craving now\n\nThe good, and the bad, and the end\n\n'Cause I can take it, I can take it\n\n\n\nYou're painting me a dream that I\n\nWouldn't belong in, wouldn't belong in\n\n\n\nOver the hills and far away\n\nA million miles from L.A\n\nJust anywhere away with you\n\nI know we've got to get away\n\nSomeplace where no one knows our name\n\nWe'll find the start of something new\n\nJust take me anywhere, take me anywhere\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\n\n\nFun, little less fun\n\nLittle less, over, over, over, over, me\n\nOh, fun, little less fun\n\nLittle less, over, over, over, over, me\n\n\n\nTake me anywhere\n\nOh, anywhere\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\nTake me anywhere\n\n\n\nOver the hills and far away\n\nA million miles from L.A\n\nJust anywhere away with you\n\nI know we've got to get away\n\nSomeplace where no one knows our name\n\nWe'll find the start of something new\n\nJust take me anywhere, take me anywhere\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\nJust take me anywhere, take me anywhere\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\n\n\nFun, little less fun\n\nLittle less, over, over, over, over, me\n\nAnywhere away with you\n\nOh",
