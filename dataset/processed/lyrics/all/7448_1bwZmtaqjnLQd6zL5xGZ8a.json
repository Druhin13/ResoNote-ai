  "lyrics": "Maybe I just need to feed my vices, yeah\r\nWho am I? I haven't realized it yet\r\nI need to ignite this light inside my flare\r\n'Cause I do not enjoy holding on by a thread\r\nTry again every morning, it's exhausting, ooh\r\nSomewhere in there, I still have a heart of gold\n\nTrouble, trouble, dripping, dripping down my cheeks\n\nHad to count my blessings, now I found some peace\n\n\n\nOne, two, three\n\nGoing 'round and 'round again\n\nYou're set free by the time I count to ten\n\nSeven, eight, nine\n\nReady, ready: here it comes\n\nBreathin' out your waist, then just let 'em out your lungs\n\nI go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em\n\nJust let 'em out your lungs\n\nGo-go get 'em, go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em\n\nJust let 'em out your lungs\n\n\n\nYour air isn't toxic, so don't hold your breathe\n\nSee you doing it anyway\n\nBut no one's impressed\n\nYou hope someone contests your decision\n\nThink you've been taking too much pride in the prison\n\nThat you built 'cause you feel like it's safer in here\n\n'Cause you don't have to face anything that you fear\n\nYeah, I know what it's like to feel cold every night\n\nBut you just gotta breathe\n\nCome along, follow me\n\nLike this\n\n\n\nOne, two, three\n\nGoing 'round and 'round again\n\nYou're set free by the time I count to ten\n\nSeven, eight, nine\n\nReady, ready: here it comes\n\nBreathin' out your waist, then just let 'em out your lungs\n\nI go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em\n\nJust let 'em out your lungs\n\nGo-go get 'em, go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em\n\nJust let 'em out your lungs\n\n\n\nI race so fast that I can't sit\n\nMy mood change quicker then the second hand ticks\n\nPulse keep rising while I race against the clock\n\nSo terrified of failing, I don't think I'll ever stop\n\nKilling roses just to build a staircase\n\nBy the time I climb it, wanna be a different place\n\nThey tell me increased, then they tell me upgrade\n\nBuild it bigger, build it better\n\nDon't get upstaged\n\nWhat's the point, though\n\nWhen every day is preparation?\n\nAlways next in line, I'm forever stuck here waiting\n\nThis time I tell 'em all to hush, hush\n\nBefore my bones turn to dust\n\nTogether like this\n\n\n\nOne, two, three\n\nGoing 'round and 'round again\n\nYou're set free by the time I count to ten\n\nSeven, eight, nine\n\nReady, ready: here it comes\n\nBreathin' out your waist, then just let 'em out your lungs\n\nI go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em\n\nJust let 'em out your lungs\n\nGo-go get 'em, go-go get 'em, I go-go get 'em\n\nJust let 'em out your lungs",
