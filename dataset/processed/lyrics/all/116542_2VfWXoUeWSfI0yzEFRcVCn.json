  "lyrics": "Outside, out of sight\r\nRiding on a wave we've talked about\r\nInside, dimm the light\r\nYou can do to me what you want tonight\r\nTake it slow, in control\n\nAll I have to do is follow\n\nYou are my lullaby\n\nThis was never meant for you and I\n\nThis was never meant for you and I\n\nThis was never meant for you\n\n\n\nOutside, out of sight\n\nRiding on a storm into the night\n\nInside, make it right\n\nRunning through a dream made of broken glass\n\n\n\nTake it slow, in control\n\nAll I have to do is follow\n\nYou are my lullaby\n\nThis was never meant for you and I\n\nThis was never meant for you and I\n\nThis was never meant for you\n\nThis was never meant for you",
