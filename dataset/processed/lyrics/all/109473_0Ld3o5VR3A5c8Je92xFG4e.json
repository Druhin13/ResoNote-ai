  "lyrics": "Once I was a wild dog\r\nOn the trail to a kill to feed my existence\r\nThat's where I first picked up the scent to her\r\nWanted her for my own after the kill\r\nThe stag was ours, together we brought it down\r\nAnd it was the first blood that we tasted together\n\n\n\nWe were wild dogs\n\nWild dogs\n\nWild dogs\n\n\n\nWe'd roll amongst the sweet grass lickin' on each other\n\nAs the night replaced the day we'd bay and howl at the moon\n\nWe'd lay down and we'd listen to the silence of the stars\n\nShootin' 'cross the universe for us to see, her and me\n\n\n\nWe were wild dogs\n\nWild dogs\n\nWild dogs\n\n\n\nWe'd go runnin' through the forest with the grace of an eagle\n\nWith the freedom of the wind and the strength of our youth\n\nJust like our old friend the Indian, we'd only kill to feed ourselves\n\nOr to protect those we loved from danger\n\n\n\nWe were wild dogs\n\nWild dogs\n\nWe were wild dogs",
