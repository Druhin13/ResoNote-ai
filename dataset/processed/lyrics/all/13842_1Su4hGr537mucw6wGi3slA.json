  "lyrics": "I know that you're so afraid, I feel it too\r\nYou know I can see the pain inside of you\r\nI know I'm not going anywhere\r\nWhen the silence hits the air, you'll know it too\r\nI know you never asked for this or ever would\n\nAnd you carried all the weight alone, you thought you should\n\nJust know I'm not going anywhere\n\nWhen life's not feeling fair\n\n\n\nI wish I could give you an answer\n\nSay the right words and it'd make you feel better\n\nBut I'm just me, nothing perfect or special\n\nAnd I can't make it right today\n\nBut I'm here and I'll never fade away\n\n\n\nI know back then you played a part for all of them\n\nYou know when you're with me you don't have to play pretend\n\nI know you can speak your mind and not get scared\n\nWhen the silence hits the air, you'll know it too\n\n\n\nI wish I could give you an answer\n\nSay the right words and it'd make you feel better\n\nBut I'm just me, nothing perfect or special\n\nAnd I can't make it right today\n\nBut I'm here and I'll never fade away\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that you know that I'll always be someone to lean on\n\nAnd when life gets heavy, I'll carry you through\n\nAnd I'm hoping that one day it all gets easier\n\nIt feels lighter, more beautiful for me\n\n\n\nAnd I hope that you know that I'll always be someone to lean on\n\nAnd when life gets heavy, I'll carry you through\n\nAnd I'm hoping that one day it all gets easier\n\nIt feels lighter, more beautiful for you\n\nIt feels lighter, more beautiful for you\n\n\n\nI wish I could give you an answer\n\nSay the right words and it'd make you feel better\n\nBut I'm just me, nothing perfect or special\n\nAnd I can't make it right today\n\nBut I'm here and I'll never fade away",
