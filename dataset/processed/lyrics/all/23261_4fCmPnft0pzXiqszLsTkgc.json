  "lyrics": "Waiting for the sun to rise you lost another day\r\nSon of man used to stealing, you'd better find another way\r\nStill I rise, still I rise under the silver moon\r\nNever searching for the answer, now the hunter is the fool\r\nSuch a fool\n\nI survive tired lies\n\nBehind your blinded eyes\n\nBeware the wolf named Crow\n\n\n\nWishing for the winds to change, the path is still unknown\n\nTruth was told but turned to fable but the tongue is all your own\n\nReturn to fight through pain and might before your soul is sold\n\nRun like hell the only answer, you pray the trail's gone cold\n\nSo cold\n\n\n\nSin arrives one last night\n\nThe hunted still survives, the truth has shown\n\nA man alone, beware the wolf named Crow\n\n\n\n[?]\n\nDust to dust [?]\n\nBeware the wolf named Crow\n\n\n\nLost horizon bleeds the bleeder, still the verdict gives\n\nEternal plea to your maker and return to where he lives\n\nKill the pain, remain insane, it's now your only law\n\nAll along from dusk to dawn, it was always tooth and claw\n\nTooth and claw\n\n\n\nHypnotized by the hunter's eyes\n\nThe truth is now a lie\n\nHypnotized by the hunter's eyes\n\nThe truth is now a lie\n\nHypnotized by the hunter's eyes\n\nBeware the wolf named Crow",
