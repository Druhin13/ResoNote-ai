  "lyrics": "Trumpets cry warnings from heaven\r\nThe virgin dressed with the sun\r\nWith the moon on her feet\r\nOn her head a garland of twelve stars\r\nbeing with a child she cries\r\nfor the birth of a King\n\n\n\nWar Horns the sign of the times\n\nBreak through the silent cries\n\n\n\nPetrified I'm facing the rapture\n\nChoking on tears the prophecy fulfills\n\nThe angels arise announcing the gathering\n\nThe wages of sin are for all who live to see\n\n\n\nWar Horns the sign of the times\n\nBreak through the silent cries\n\nVisions from prophets unveiled\n\nAll burns in the lake of fire\n\n\n\nFire will be raining from the sky\n\nThe sun will be darkened\n\nThe moon will not give its light\n\nThe stars will fall\n\nAnd the powers of heaven are shaken\n\nThat's when the Son of Man\n\nWill arise in the clouds\n\n\n\nWar Horns the sign of the times\n\nBreak through our silent cries\n\nVisions from prophets unveil\n\nAll burns in the lake of fire",
