These straight facts\n\nTryna take the swag but we don’t want it back\n\nI'ma boss chick so they hate that\n\nBoy, we tried your food, where the flavor at?\n\nYou number 1? That’s a joke\n\nWhy yo' ice cream machine always broke?\n\nWhy yo' drive through always slow?\n\nWhy yo' innovation just can’t grow?\n\nIt's queen Wendy, need I say mo'?\n\nThat Baconator go crazy, that spicy chicken go crazy\n\nYou can take a fry and dip it in the sauce, it still be so tasty\n\nThem lil tweets don't phase me, McDonalds be so lazy\n\nI know the reason you hatin' me 'cause I'm fast food's First Lady\n\nIt's queen Wendy up in this thang\n\nYou can't beat us serving them thangs\n\nY'all too chicken for this beef\n\nI'ma leave you resting in grease\n\nNuggs for Carter, retweet\n\nBoy, you know you can't compete\n\nOn top of our game, man watch us\n\nSee its no stoppin' me (flex)\n\n\n\nUh, red head with my pig tails, ah\n\nFast food's first lady, ah\n\nYou cannot play me",
