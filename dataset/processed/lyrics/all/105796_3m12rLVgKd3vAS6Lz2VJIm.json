  "lyrics": "My bed is bigger\r\nI'm sleeping so much better\r\nWithout you spooning me\r\nMy music's louder\r\nDon't have to hear about it\r\nAnd you won't hear from me\n\n\n\nNow your drug is wearing off\n\nYou burned me like a molotov\n\nI see what I've been missing all along\n\n\n\nSo here's to moving on\n\nNow that you're gone\n\nI'll take back my heart and put it back together\n\nNo more fake goodbyes\n\nDone with the lies\n\nYou said we'd get drunk and rule the world forever\n\nThis is, this is, the last love song\n\n\n\nTo make you smile\n\nI wrote a million verses\n\nAnd stupid melodies\n\nThe ashtray's empty\n\nThrow out the shit that you lent me\n\nJust one song left to sing\n\n\n\nNow your drug is wearing off\n\nYou burned me like a molotov\n\nI see what I've been missing all along\n\n\n\nSo here's to moving on\n\nNow that you're gone\n\nI'll take back my heart and put it back together\n\nNo more fake goodbyes\n\nDone with the lies\n\nYou said we'd get drunk and rule the world forever\n\nThis is, this is, the last love song",
