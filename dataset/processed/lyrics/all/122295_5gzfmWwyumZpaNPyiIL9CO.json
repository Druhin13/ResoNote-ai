  "lyrics": "It ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah\r\nAnd it ain't a mansion on a hill\r\nIt's perfectly imperfect\r\nIt's worth more than it's worth\r\nIt's our life, it's our heart, it's our home\r\nThis is our kingdom\n\n\n\nIt's been late nights, a few good fights\n\nWouldn't sleep until we worked things out\n\nIt's been long days of leanin' on faith\n\nEven when we had our doubts\n\nBarely gettin' by, stretched to the limits\n\nAll the hard times, no, I wouldn't trade a minute\n\nWe've come so far, it made us who we are\n\nRight here, right now\n\n\n\nIt ain't always pretty as a picture, yeah\n\nAnd it ain't a mansion on a hill\n\nIt's perfectly imperfect\n\nIt's worth more than it's worth\n\nIt's our life, it's our heart, it's our home\n\nThis is our kingdom",
