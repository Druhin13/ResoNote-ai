Hey, hey\nWhen I look into your eyes, I'm under your love spell (Love spell)\n\nI've been thinking a lot about it\nLet's just get away where we belong\nAll the money in the world can't buy your love\n'Cause our conversations so deep (So deep)\nIt's like I'm high when you speak (You speak)\nI lose my mind when you leave (You leave)\n\n\nOh baby, babe, you love me right, you hold me tight\nHold me up against this music (Woo-hoo)\nOh you do it, you do it to me (Woo-hoo)\nBaby, babe, you love me right, you hold me tight (Whoa-oh)\nUp against this music\nOh you do it, you do it to me (Yeah, yeah)\n\nHow you do, how you do, how you do that to me?\nHow you do, how you do, how you do that to me?\n\nShould I give my time?\nJust don't waste it, grab my waist and baby just stay right here\nSo babe, take my hand\nPlease don't play with my perception, let's make it last instead\n\n\nI've been thinking a lot about it\nLet's just get away where we belong\nAll the money in the world can't buy your love\n'Cause our conversations so deep (So deep)\nIt's like I'm high when you speak (You speak)\nI lose my mind when you leave (You leave)\n\nOh baby, babe, you love me right, you hold me tight\nHold me up against this music (Woo-hoo)\nOh you do it, you do it to me (Woo-hoo)\nBaby, babe, you love me right, you hold me tight (Whoa-oh)\nUp against this music\nOh you do it, you do it to me (Yeah, yeah)\n\nHow you do, how you do, how you do that to me?\n\nHow you do, how you do, how you do that to me?",
