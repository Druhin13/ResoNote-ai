  "lyrics": "Used to heatin' up in the shower, out of her arms\r\nNow you’re always in a rush\r\nI could be paranoid but I swear, it's up in the air\r\nAre you fallin' out of love?\r\nThe more I think about what we were, the more that I’m sure\r\nSure, it wasn't what it was, yeah\n\nWe used to be, used to be better\n\nWe used to talk about when we're old, now I don't know\n\nIf we gon' make it through the month\n\nDon't wanna make it real if it's not, I wish I could stop\n\nWith over-overthinking us\n\nFeelin' like it’s nowhere to go, it’s taking a toll\n\nI don't wanna give you up\n\nBut we used to be, used to be better\n\n\n\nIs it just me?\n\nDid our talks get a little bit shorter?\n\nIs it just me?\n\nDid the night get a little bit colder?\n\nWhen that argument got vulgar\n\nWhen it should’ve just blown over\n\nIt was nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\n\n\nIt's two AM, you're not even home, I'm here alone\n\nCallin’ but your phone is off\n\nYou go and blame it all on your friends, not that again\n\nNeed to know what's going on, 'cause\n\nThe more I think about what we were, the more that I'm sure\n\nSure, I'm not the only one, yeah\n\nWe used to be, used to be better\n\n\n\nNever forget, back when we met, you had another one\n\nYou did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one\n\n\n\nIs it just me?\n\nDid our talks get a little bit shorter?\n\nIs it just me?\n\nDid the night get a little bit colder?\n\nWhen that argument got vulgar\n\nWhen it should've just blown over\n\nIt was nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\n\n\nNever forget, back when we met, you had another one\n\nYou did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one\n\nNever forget, back when we met, you had another one\n\nYou did it then, you'd do it again, now I'm the other one\n\n\n\nIs it just me? (Just me, baby)\n\nDid our talks get a little bit shorter?\n\nIs it just me? (Just me, baby)\n\nDid the night get a little bit colder?\n\nWhen that argument got vulgar\n\nWhen it should've just blown over\n\nIt was nothing, nothing\n\n\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\n(Oh, is it just me?)\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\n(I been standin', waitin', gazin' up)\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\n(You know, you know, you know, you know that?)\n\nIs it just, just me? Ooh\n\n(I been waiting for you, baby, until now)\n\n\n\nIs it just me, is it, is it?\n\nIs it just me, is it, is it?",
