  "lyrics": "There is a wrestling in my heart and my mind\r\nA disturbance and a tension I cannot seem to drive\r\nAnd if I'm honest, there's quite a bit of fear\r\nTo sit here in this silence and really hear You\r\nWhat will You ask of me?\n\nWill I listen to Your voice when You speak?\n\n\n\nHelp me to move, help me to see\n\nHelp me to do whatever You would ask of me\n\nHelp me to go, God help me to stay\n\nI'm feeling so alone here\n\nAnd I know that You're faithful\n\nBut I can barely breathe\n\nGod help me\n\n\n\nSometimes things, they are black and white\n\nSometimes they are not and that leaves us torn inside\n\nAnd in the middle, we are left to wonder\n\nWho we are, what You want and where we're going\n\n\n\nOh such a mystery\n\nI don't always understand\n\nBut I believe!\n\n\n\nHelp me to move, help me to see\n\nHelp me to do whatever You would ask of me\n\nHelp me to go, God help me to stay\n\nI'm feeling so alone here\n\nAnd I know that You're faithful\n\nBut I can barely breathe\n\nGod help me\n\n\n\nI don't know the future, it's one day at a time\n\nBut I know I'll be okay with Your hand holding mine\n\nSo take all my resistance\n\nOh God I need Your grace\n\nOne step and then the other\n\nShow me the way\n\nShow me the way!\n\n\n\nHelp me to move, help me to see\n\nHelp me to do whatever You would ask of me\n\nHelp me to go, God help me to stay\n\nI'm feeling so alone here\n\nAnd I know that You're faithful\n\nBut I can barely breathe\n\nBut I can barely breathe\n\nBut I can barely breathe\n\nGod help me",
