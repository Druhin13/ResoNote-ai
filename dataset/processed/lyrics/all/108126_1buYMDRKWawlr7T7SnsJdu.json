  "lyrics": "It was 6:48 I was walking home\r\nStepped to the gate and I'm all alone\r\nI had chicken on the plate but the food was cold\r\nThen I covered up my face so that no one knows\r\nI didn't want trouble\r\nI'm the boy in the bubble\n\nBut then came trouble\n\nWhen my mum walked into the living room\n\nShe said boy you gotta tell me what they did to you\n\nI said you don't wanna know the things that I had to do\n\nShe said son you gotta tell me why you're black and blue\n\nI said I didn't want trouble\n\nI'm the boy in the bubble\n\nBut then came trouble\n\n\n\nAnd my heart was pumping\n\nChest was sceaming\n\nMind was running\n\nAir was freezing\n\nPut my hands up\n\nPut my hands up\n\nI told this kid I'm ready for a fight\n\n\n\nPunch my face\n\nDo it 'cause I like the pain\n\nEvery time you curse my name\n\nI know you want the satisfaction\n\nThat's not going to happen\n\nKnock me out\n\nKick me when I'm on the ground\n\nIt's only going to let you down\n\nI'm the lightning and the thunder\n\nYou're the one that suffers\n\n\n\nWell I squared him up with my chest exposed\n\nHe threw a quick left hook\n\nAnd it broke my nose\n\nI had thick red blood running down my clothes\n\nAnd a sick sick look 'cause I like it though\n\nI said I didn't want trouble\n\nI'm the boy in the bubble\n\nBut then came trouble\n\n\n\nAnd my heart was pumping\n\nChest was sceaming\n\nMind was running\n\nAir was freezing\n\nPut my hands up\n\nPut my hands up\n\nI told this kid I'm ready for a fight\n\n\n\nPunch my face\n\nDo it 'cause I like the pain\n\nEvery time you curse my name\n\nI know you want the satisfaction\n\nThat's not going to happen\n\nKnock me out\n\nKick me when I'm on the ground\n\nIt's only going to let you down\n\nI'm the lightning and the thunder\n\nYou're the one that suffers\n\n\n\nIt's 6:48 he's walking home\n\nWith the blood on his hand from my broken nose\n\nBut like every other day he was scared to go\n\nBack to his house\n\nBecause his pop was home\n\nDrowning his troubles in whiskey bubbles\n\nJust looking for trouble\n\nWell there's no excuse for the things he did\n\nBut there's a lot at home that he's dealing with\n\nBecause he's dad's been drunk since he was a kid\n\nAnd I hope one day he'll say to him\n\nPut down those bubbles\n\nAnd that buckle\n\nAnd this broken bubble\n\n\n\nPunch my face\n\nDo it 'cause I like the pain\n\nEvery time you curse my name\n\nI know you want the satisfaction\n\nThat's not going to happen\n\nKnock me out\n\nKick me when I'm on the ground\n\nIt's only going to let you down\n\nI'm the lightning and the thunder\n\nYou're the one that suffers",
