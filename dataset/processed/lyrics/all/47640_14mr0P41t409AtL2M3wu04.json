  "lyrics": "Stop acting like you're all that\r\nYou're actually the most pathetic\r\nYeah, try to provoke me even more\r\nSo I can have some fun for a moment\r\nIf you only chase after money, power and fame\n\nYour crotch is gonna rip and you're gonna fall\n\nThey say love is good, friendship is good\n\nBut be warned, the back of your head might be in pain\n\n\n\nHey doctor doctor, please save me\n\nBecause I'm about to go insane\n\nStop trying to awkwardly change the subject\n\nHear me say\n\n\n\nIt's hard for me to be sober\n\nI can't do anything\n\nI hate being sober\n\nI can't fall asleep without you\n\n\n\nTime is so damn slow, I'm just growing old, I live like I'm dead\n\nI have so many damn things to do but I have nothing that I want to do\n\n\n\nThe world is cold to me\n\nPeople's eyes are prickling on me\n\nI seem like an adult but I'm really a child that's really tall\n\nMy young dreams are just faded fantasies\n\nMy mood is like a vast wilderness\n\nPeople don't understand me\n\nSo I just wanna lose it without even knowing\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\n\nGet drunk, get drunk, go to heaven\n\nAfter I wake, I'm in hell, I don't last long\n\nI'm like Popeye without spinach\n\nThe laughter bomb tempts me\n\n\n\nHey TAXI TAXI, take me away\n\nBecause this place is too hard to be in\n\nSo I can at least breathe for a few days\n\n\n\nIt's hard for me to be sober\n\nI can't do anything\n\nI hate being sober\n\nI can't fall asleep without you\n\n\n\nTime is so damn slow, I'm just growing old, I live like I'm dead\n\nI have so many damn things to do but I have nothing that I want to do\n\n\n\nWithout you, everything is hard\n\nWithout you, this dark night, this cold world\n\nIt's too hard for me\n\n\n\nWithout you, I'm still left alone here\n\nI'm waiting for you, only believing in you\n\nBut I'm a fool, no no no\n\n\n\nIt's hard for me to be sober\n\nI can't do anything\n\nI hate being sober\n\nI can't fall asleep without you",
