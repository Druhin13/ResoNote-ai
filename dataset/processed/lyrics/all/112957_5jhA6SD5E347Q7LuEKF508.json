  "lyrics": "My life is changing\r\nin so many ways\r\nI don't know who\r\nto trust anymore\r\nThere's a shadow running\r\nthru my days\n\nLike a beggar going\n\nfrom door to door.\n\n\n\nI was thinking that\n\nmaybe I'd get a maid\n\nFind a place nearby\n\nfor her to stay.\n\nJust someone\n\nto keep my house clean,\n\nFix my meals and go away.\n\n\n\nA maid. A man needs a maid.\n\nA maid.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to make that change\n\nWhen life and love\n\nturns strange.\n\nAnd old.\n\n\n\nTo give a love,\n\nyou gotta live a love.\n\nTo live a love,\n\nyou gotta be \"part of\"\n\nWhen will I see you again?\n\n\n\nA while ago somewhere\n\nI don't know when\n\nI was watching\n\na movie with a friend.\n\nI fell in love with the actress.\n\nShe was playing a part\n\nthat I could understand.\n\n\n\nA maid. A man needs a maid.\n\nA maid.\n\n\n\nWhen will I see you again?",
