  "lyrics": "One look, dark room\r\nmeant just for you\r\nTime moved too fast\r\nYou play it back\r\nButtons on a coat\r\nlighthearted joke\n\nNo proof not much\n\nBut you saw enough\n\nSmall talk, he drives\n\nCoffee at midnight, The light reflects \n\nThe chain on your neck\n\nHe says look up\n\nAnd your shoulders brush\n\nNo proof, one touch\n\nYou felt enough\n\n\n\nYou can hear it in the silence, silence\n\nYou can feel it on the way home, way home\n\nYou can see it with the lights out, lights out\n\nYou are in love, true love\n\nYou are in love\n\n\n\nMorning, his place\n\nburnt toast, sunday\n\nYou keep his shirt\n\nHe keeps his word\n\nAnd for once you let go\n\nOf your fears and your ghosts\n\nOne step, not much, but it said enough\n\nYou kissed on sidewalks\n\nYou fight and you talk\n\nOne night he wakes, strange look on his face\n\nPauses, then says, you're my best friend\n\nAnd you knew what it was, he is in love\n\n\n\nYou can hear it in the silence, silence\n\nYou can feel it on the way home, way home\n\nYou can see it with the lights out, lights out\n\nYou are in love, true love\n\n\n\nSo it goes\n\nyou two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round\n\nAnd he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown\n\nYou understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars\n\nAnd why I've spent my whole life try to put it in words\n\n\n\nCause you can hear it in the silence\n\nYou can feel it on the way home\n\nYou can see it with the lights out\n\nYou are in love, true love\n\nYou're in love\n\n\n\nYou can hear it in the silence, silence\n\nYou can feel it on the way home, way home\n\nYou can see it with the lights out, lights out\n\nYou are in love, true love\n\nYou're in love\n\nYou can hear it in the silence, silence\n\nYou can feel it on the way home, way home\n\nYou can see it with the lights out, lights out\n\nYou are in love, true love\n\nYou're in love",
