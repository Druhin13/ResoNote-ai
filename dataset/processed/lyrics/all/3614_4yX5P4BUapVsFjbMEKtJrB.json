  "lyrics": "I don't know the language, all the words mean fear\r\nThis land is sinking as I try to get clear\r\nKnowledge, then wisdom\r\nThe answer's right here\r\nBurn the sage and sow the seed\r\nNobody left to feed\n\n\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nRight, left, right, left, fantasy, fantasy\n\nDon't let them pave my feet down or I'll drown\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nRight, left, right from coast to coast\n\nNever learn to say goodbye\n\n\n\nSee you in the middle\n\nWhen the walls come tumbling down to the sea\n\n\n\nI know your language, but I wish it were silence\n\nThe seeds are sown in all the small acts of violence\n\nI was just so tired, too tired to say a thing\n\nKept my head down, eyes closed, and let freedom ring\n\nWe let freedom ring\n\nBut whose freedom?\n\n\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nRight, left, right, left, fantasy, fantasy\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nThey're gonna pave my feet down and I'll drown\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nRight, left, right from coast to coast\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nBetter run, better run if want to move at all\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nNow is it time to say goodbye to New York?\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nWelcome the ocean and lay your blame down\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nRight, left, right from coast to coast\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nBetter learn to say goodbye\n\n\n\nSee you in the middle\n\nWhen the walls come tumbling down to the sea\n\n\n\n(But whose freedom?)\n\nBuild a sky, build it big enough to hold us all\n\nBuild it big enough to hold us all\n\n\n\nRight, left, right, left, fantasy, fantasy\n\nUntil you're looking your fear in the eyes\n\nRight, left, right from coast to coast\n\nI'll surrender to the truth, but never to the lies\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nMaybe I'll never say goodbye to New York\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nAnd then they'll pave my feet down and I'll drown\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nRight, left, right from coast to coast\n\n(Coast to coast)\n\nNever learn to say goodbye",
