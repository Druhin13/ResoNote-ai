  "lyrics": "Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once\r\nYou say goodbye over and over and over again\r\nOver and over and over again\r\nSometimes, sometimes you don’t say goodbye once\r\nYou say goodbye over and over and over again\r\nOver and over and over again\n\n\n\nIt was a month since he passed, maybe less\n\nAnd no one knew what to do, we were such a mess\n\nWe were texting, we were calling, we were checking in\n\nWe said we ought to play a show in honor of our friend\n\nWell now that show's finally here, it's tonight\n\nSupposed to go to the bowl, get on stage, dim the lights\n\nWith our friends and our family, in his name, celebrate\n\nThere's no way that I'll be ready to get back up on that stage\n\nCan't remember if I've cancelled any show\n\nBut I think about what I'm supposed to do and I don't know\n\nCause I think about not doing it the same way as before\n\nAnd it makes me wanna puke my fucking guts out on the floor\n\nWe rehearsed it for a month, I'm not worried about the set\n\nI get tackled by the grief at times that I would least expect\n\nI know what I should be doing when I'm singing but instead\n\nWe'll be playing through a song and I'd remember in my head\n\n\n\nSometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once\n\nYou say goodbye over and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\nSometimes, sometimes you don’t say goodbye once\n\nYou say goodbye over and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\n\n\nWhat (are) they saying, I'm not raw?\n\nWhat the fuck you take me for?\n\nAll the sudden you hear what I've said a hundred ways before?\n\nI been pushed, I been trapped\n\nDrug myself through hell and back and\n\nFallen flat and had the balls to start it all again from scratch\n\nHow do you feel, how you doing, how'd the show go?\n\nAm I insane to say the truth is that I don’t know\n\nMy body aches heads spinning this is all wrong\n\nI almost lost it in middle of a couple songs\n\nAnd everybody that I talk to is like, “wow\n\nMust be really hard to figure out what to do now”\n\nWell thank you genius, you think it'll be a challenge\n\nOnly my life's work hanging in the fucking balance\n\nAnd all I wanted was to get a little bit of closure\n\nAnd every step I took I looked and wasn't any closer\n\n'Cause sometimes when you say goodbye, yeah you say it\n\nOver and over and over and over\n\n\n\nSometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once\n\nYou say goodbye over and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\nSometimes, sometimes you don’t say goodbye once\n\nYou say goodbye over and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\n\n\nOver and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\nOver and over and over again\n\n(Over and over and over again)\n\n(Over and over and over again)",
