  "lyrics": "The president has a sex tape\r\nThe government sold you drugs\r\nI'm just trying to get paid\r\nBut nobody's coughing up\r\nThe president has a sex tape\r\nThe medicine made you cry\n\nHush don't worry cause I'm bringing a mask\n\nYeah everybody's got a disguise\n\n\n\nThe president has a sex tape\n\nThe oceans all dried up\n\nThe devil got the dealer\n\nThe dealer got the dollar\n\nDon't tell me I can live off love\n\nThe president has a sex tape\n\nYour daughters aren't safe at night\n\nI got a feeling that my body is owned\n\nA feeling that my body ain't mine\n\n\n\nLook at who's having the fun\n\nEasy to smile when you're pointing the gun\n\n\n\nThe president has a sex tape\n\nThe immigrant died at sea\n\nFirst they come for you\n\nAnd then they come for me",
