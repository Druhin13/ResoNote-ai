  "lyrics": "We'll say goodbye to the old place\r\nDon't look at the faces left\r\nI'm sure it'll be good fun\r\nMaking money at your kids' expense\r\nTo a place where everything's easy\r\nFeeding my baby with stamps\n\n\n\nAnd if they ask, why did you come?\n\n(Don't you know) there's a real war on?\n\n(Did the papers not) tell you about it?\n\n\n\nDon't you worry, I will be fine\n\n(With a knife at my neck and my very last dime)\n\nI got a job in an office block\n\n(With a swish canteen and an Oxbridge tie)\n\nAnd if I get sick my sister will treat me\n\n(I hear it's all free and so a- f- f- easy)\n\n\n\nAnd if they ask, why did you come?\n\n(Don't you know) there's a real war on?\n\n(Did the papers not) tell you about it?\n\n(Don't you know) there's a real war on?\n\n(Did the papers not) tell you?\n\n\n\nAnd if they ask, why did you come?\n\nAnd if they say I should go home\n\nSend me back where I belong\n\nTake a walk with me, I'll show you some\n\n\n\n(So you know)\n\n(So you know)",
