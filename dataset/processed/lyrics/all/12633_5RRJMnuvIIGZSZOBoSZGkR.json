  "lyrics": "I think we both saw this falling\r\nI know we both felt like running\r\nI'm Second guessing myself\r\nI called out for help\r\nBut no one was coming\r\nSo I gave in to the comfort\n\nDon't know I really wanted it\n\nThe world had left me alone\n\nWith no where to go\n\nSo I turned back to hold you\n\n\n\nI hit the dirt as you tried to watch me leave\n\nI felt the hurt as it tried to stop me breathe\n\nWondering if you'll remember me\n\n\n\nSo we gave in to the pressure\n\nCause we had no way to measure\n\nHow deep the damage had gone\n\nWe kept moving on\n\nJust to get back together\n\n\n\nThe hardest part was seeing how far fell\n\nI never thought that after finding you\n\nI'd give up myself\n\nI still remember looking\n\ninto your eyes\n\nI saw the same thing I was thinking\n\nhad been crossing your mind\n\n\n\nI hit the dirt as you tried to watch me leave\n\nI felt the hurt as it tried to stop me breathe\n\nWondering if you'll remember me\n\nIt's all a blur but it seemed so clear to me\n\nI wasn't sure but I had to leave it be\n\nWondering if you'll remember me\n\n\n\nIf you'll Remember me\n\n\n\nSo tell the world I went off like a gun\n\nCause their never gonna know that\n\nYou pulled the trigger\n\n\n\nI hit the dirt as you tried to watch me leave\n\nI felt the hurt as it tried to stop me breathe\n\nWondering if you'll remember me\n\nIt's all a blur but it seemed so clear to me\n\nI wasn't sure but I had to leave it be\n\nWondering if you'll remember me",
