  "lyrics": "Would you jump if I told you, you could never lose?\r\nAn empty house, glass walls caving through the roof\r\nMama told me not to play with glass when I was young\r\nHeld on tight, waiting for my hands to come undone\r\nBroke my skin, broke my heart, broke the wall near the TV room\n\nIs it nothing new?\n\nIs it nothing to you?\n\n\n\nShackled to the back of your headboard\n\nHoping you would fall down into me, crash into me\n\nWon't you love me now? Fucking love me now\n\nIt's all broken, unspoken\n\nJust breathe me in, taste me on your lips\n\nYou can let me go, if you need to let me go\n\n\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\n\n\n\nIf I told you I was broken, would you love me still?\n\nShattered hearts, crossed stars, never saw myself\n\nTrue lovers never cover up each others scars\n\nFucked me over once or twice, yeah, who's counting scars?\n\nShut my eyes, shut my mouth, shut the door to our little home\n\n\n\nIs it nothing new?\n\nIs it nothing to you?\n\n\n\nShackled to the back of your headboard\n\nHoping you would fall down into me, crash into me\n\nWon't you love me now? Fucking love me now\n\nIt's all broken, unspoken\n\nJust breathe me in, taste me on your lips\n\nYou can let me go, if you need to let me go\n\n\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\n\n\n\nShackled to the back of your headboard\n\nHoping you would fall down into me, crash into me\n\nWon't you love me now? Fucking love me now\n\nIt's all broken, unspoken\n\nJust breathe me in, taste me on your lips\n\nYou can let me go, if you need to let me go\n\n\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now\n\nLove, love me now\n\nLove me now, love me now\n\n\n\nWon't you love me now? Fucking love me now\n\nIt's all broken, unspoken",
