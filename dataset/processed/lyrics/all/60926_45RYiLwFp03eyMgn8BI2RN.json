  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Believe par Brooks & Dunn\r\nOld man Wrigley lived in that white house\nDown the street where I grew up\nMama used to send me over with things\nWe struck a friendship up\nI spent a few long summers\nOut on his old porch swing\n\nSaid he was in the war when in the navy\nLost his wife, lost his baby\nBroke down and asked him one time\n\"How you keep from goin' crazy\"\nHe said, \"I'll see my wife and son in just a little while\"\nI asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled\n\n\nSaid, \"I raise my hands\nBow my head\nI'm findin' more and more truth\nIn the words written in red\nThey tell me that there's more to life\nThan just what I can see, oh, I believe\"\n\nA few years later I was off at college\nTalkin' to mom on the phone one night\nGettin' all caught up on the gossip\nThe ins and outs of the small town life\nShe said, \"Oh, by the way son\nOld man Wrigley has died\"\n\nLater on that night\nI laid there thinkin' back\nThought about a couple long-lost summers\nI didn't know whether to cry or laugh\n\nIf there was ever anybody\nDeserved a ticket to the other side\nIt'd be that sweet old man\nWho looked me in the eye\n\nSaid, \"I raise my hands\nBow my head\nI'm findin' more and more truth\nIn the words written in red\nThey tell me that there's more to life\nThan just what I can see...\"\n\nI can't quote the book\nThe chapter or the verse\nYou can't tell me it all ends\nIn a slow ride in a hearse\nYou know I'm more and more convinced\nThe longer that I live\n\nYeah, this can't be... no, this can't be\nNo, this can't be all there is\n\nLord, I raise my hands\nBow my head\nOh, I'm findin' more and more truth\nIn the words written in red\nThey tell me that there's more to this\nThan just what I can see, I believe\n\nOh, I...\nI believe\nI believe\n(I believe)\n(I believe)\nWell, I believe\n(I believe)\nI believe\n\n(I believe)",
