  "lyrics": "We scan the empty sky always without success\r\nWe're lighting signal fires and spelling \"SOS\"\r\nWe stare at broken clocks, the truth comes twice a day\r\nWhile every second just slips away\r\nAre you gonna wait here for a sign to let you know now?\n\nAre you gonna sit there paralysed by what you've seen?\n\nOr are you gonna finally grip the wheel? I think you know how\n\nThis is more than you expected it to be\n\n\n\nDon't wait for a miracle\n\nTo tumble from the sky\n\nTo part the seas around you\n\nOr turn water into wine\n\nDon't wait for a miracle\n\nThe world is passing by\n\nThe walls that will surround you\n\nAre only in your mind\n\nWhoa-oh-oh\n\n\n\nThe stage is set and the curtains pulled\n\nReady or not, it's time - on with the show\n\nAnd now the crowds have grown impatient\n\nAnd the train has left the station\n\nAnd the candles you are lighting in the dark will fade away\n\n\n\nSo what what are you waiting for? A sign to let you know now?\n\nAre you gonna sit there paralysed by what you've seen?\n\nOr are you gonna finally grip the wheel? I think you know how\n\nAre you gonna throw it all away?\n\n\n\nDon't wait for a miracle\n\nTo tumble from the sky\n\nTo part the seas around you\n\nOr turn water into wine\n\nDon't wait for a miracle\n\nThe world is passing by\n\nThe walls that will surround you\n\nAre only in your mind\n\nWhoa-oh-oh\n\n\n\nWhen the weights we carry breaks us, we're tempted to stay down\n\nBut every road to recovery starts at the breakdown\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we don't need miracles\n\nTo tumble from the sky\n\nTo part the seas around us\n\nOr turn water into wine\n\n'Cause we are the miracles\n\nWe happen all the time\n\nWe're not scared of what surrounds us\n\nWe're not waiting for a sign\n\n\n\nWe are the miracles\n\nWe are the miracles\n\nWe are the miracles\n\nHey!",
