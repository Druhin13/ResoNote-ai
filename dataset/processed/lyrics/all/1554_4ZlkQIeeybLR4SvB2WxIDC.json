  "lyrics": "A million young poets\r\nScreamin' out their words\r\nTo a world full of people\r\nJust livin' to be heard\r\nFuture generations\r\nRidin' on the highways that we built\n\nI hope they have a better understanding\n\n\n\nCheck it out\n\nGoin' to work on Monday\n\nCheck it out\n\nGot yourself a family\n\nCheck it out\n\nAll utility bills have been paid\n\nYou can't tell your best buddy that you love him\n\nSo check it out\n\nWhere does our time go\n\nCheck it out\n\nGot a brand new house in escrow\n\nCheck it out\n\nSleepin' with your back to your loved one\n\nThis is all that we've learned about happiness\n\n\n\nCheck it out\n\nForgot to say hello to my neighbors\n\nCheck it out\n\nSometimes I question my own behavior\n\nCheck it out\n\nTalkin' about the girls that we've seen on the sly\n\nJust to tell our souls we're still the young lions\n\nSo check it out\n\nGettin' too drunk on Saturdays\n\nCheck it out\n\nPlayin' football with the kids on Sundays\n\nCheck it out\n\nSoarin' with the eagles all week long\n\nAnd this is all that we've learned about living\n\nThis is all that we've learned about living\n\n\n\nA million young poets\n\nScreamin' out their words\n\nMaybe someday\n\nThose words will be heard\n\nBy future generations\n\nRidin' on the highways that we built\n\nMaybe they'll have a better understanding\n\nCheck it out\n\nHope they'll have a better understanding\n\nCheck it out\n\nMaybe they'll have a better understanding\n\nCheck it out\n\nMaybe they'll have a better understanding\n\nCheck it out\n\nHope they have a better understanding\n\nCheck it out.....",
