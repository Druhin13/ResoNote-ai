  "lyrics": "The morning's here, and we're still caught up in the night.\r\nThe sky was clear, and everything felt right.\r\nOur time is short, but I'm sure I'll see you soon.\r\nWe'll take another walk along the bridge, and underneath the moon.\r\nWhat a find, If I could I'd hit rewind and replay.\r\nAll the moments that I wished, I could've called you mine.\n\n\n\nAnd tonight, I pray.\n\n\n\nLight a way, on my love.\n\nLight a way, from above.\n\nShine it down, lead me home,\n\nBack to him.\n\n\n\nA night away, and we've got a few to go.\n\nAnd I've mastered the art of missing, and my smile lacks a glow.\n\nThat you showed me how to shine that very night.\n\nWe were entwined, Oh God how I wish you were mine.\n\n\n\nAnd tonight, I pray.\n\n\n\nLight a way, on my love.\n\nLight a way, from above.\n\nShine it down, lead me home,\n\nBack to him.\n\nBring me back to him.\n\n\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep, I pray my heart you choose to keep.\n\nAnd if I die before I wake, all of me is yours to take.\n\nIf I don't see you again, It'd take all I have within.\n\nMaybe I'll just stay awake, I think I'll just stay awake.\n\n\n\nLight a way, on my love.\n\nLight a way, from above.\n\nShine it down, lead me home,\n\nLight a way, on my love.\n\nLight a way, from above.\n\nShine it down, lead me home.",
