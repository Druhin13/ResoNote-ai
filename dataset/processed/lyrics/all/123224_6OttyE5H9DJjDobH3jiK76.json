  "lyrics": "I'm just living for the moment\r\nFlying high on paper planes but they don't hold up\r\nMake mistakes but I'll be damned if I don't own them\r\nIt's a trip and I don't wanna get sober, don't wanna get sober\r\nLiving fast in a daydream\r\nThey can try but I'll be dead before they change me\n\n'Cause my guitar's the only one that ever paid me\n\nIt's a trip and I'll be loving every single minute\n\nAs long as I can say I did it\n\n\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nJust go and get it\n\nMy way\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way\n\nI'll say I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nI won't regret it\n\nNo way\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\n\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(As long as I can say I did it, say I did it)\n\n\n\nAin't saying I never get hopeless\n\nAnd things get crazy when it all gets out of focus\n\nOn the days when we're together, that's a bonus\n\nMy darling, we're just living for the moment, living for the moment\n\nWill you love me till you leave, yeah?\n\nYeah, I never wanna stop you going somewhere\n\nGo ahead and live the way you wanna, I will always love ya\n\nYou know that your heart is in it\n\nAs long as you can say I did it\n\n\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nJust go and get it\n\nMy way\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way\n\nI say I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nI won't regret it\n\nNo way\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\n\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(As long as I can say I did it, say I did it)\n\n\n\nWe only get one life, so make this life beautiful\n\nOne chance to make it worthwhile\n\nJust be alive, the story could be glorious\n\nBeginning to the finish, long as I can say I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\n\n\nJust go and get it\n\nMy way\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way\n\nI say I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nI won't regret it\n\nNo way\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(I can say I did it)\n\n(As long as I can say I did it, say I did it)\n\nMy way, my way, my way, my way\n\nMy way, my way, my way, my way\n\nMy way, my way, my way, my way\n\n(As long as I can say I did it)\n\n\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nJust go and get it\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way\n\nI say I did it\n\nMy way, my way\n\nMy way, my way\n\nI won't regret it\n\nNo way\n\nI'll know I did it\n\nMy way, my way",
