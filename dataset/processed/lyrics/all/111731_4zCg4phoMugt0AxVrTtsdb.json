  "lyrics": "Now every single summer on the fourth of July\r\nThinking about you baby and I don't know why\r\nBut I do, oooh, I do\r\nSeeing fireworks dancing up in the air\r\nAnd I think about the ocean and your salty hair\r\nI do, oooh, I do\n\nIf I see you in a bar and I ask you to dance\n\nWill you remember our little summer romance\n\n'Cause I do, oooh, I do\n\n\n\n'Cause it was one night, it was one chance\n\nWhen the morning sun came up over the sand\n\nSo long, you were gone\n\nYou can get your number, don't know where I'm from\n\nBut if you're out there tonight, I hope you still dream wrong\n\nI do, oooh, I do\n\n\n\nAnd when you get a little buzz and lay under the stars\n\nDo you still think about us small\n\nWe all, we all look up at the sky\n\nNo longer you and I\n\nNo matter how far apart we are\n\nWe are, we are, we are, we are\n\n\n\n'Cause it was one night, it was one chance\n\nWhen the morning sun came up over the sand\n\nSo long, you were gone\n\nSo long, so long, so long\n\n\n\nIt was one night, it was one chance\n\nWhen the morning sun came up, came up\n\nIt was one night, it was one chance\n\nWhen the morning sun came up over the sand\n\nSo long\n\n\n\nAnd I probably won't ever see you again\n\nBut I'll always dream of taking your hand\n\nAnd saying I do, oooh, I do",
