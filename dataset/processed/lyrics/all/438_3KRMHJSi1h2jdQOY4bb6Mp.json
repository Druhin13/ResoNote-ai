  "lyrics": "Go find someone else\r\nI am not ready to die\r\nGo whisper softly\r\nTo someone else\r\nAsk them\r\nTo lie down\n\n\n\nYou can tell 'em I'll be back in the minute\n\nFor now is not the time\n\nI was there already I think, as a child\n\nBut I really can't remember why\n\n\n\nSomeone in the doorway\n\nSomeone in the light\n\nSomeone through the wall always\n\nSomeone left outside\n\n\n\nGo find someone else\n\nI am not ready to decide\n\nGo whisper softly\n\nTo the man with no time\n\nAsk him\n\nTo pick sides\n\n\n\nYou can tell 'em I'll be back in a minute\n\nFor now is not the time\n\nGone to find the root they all chewed on\n\nFor millennia\n\nDo something better with my time\n\n\n\nSomeone in the doorway\n\nSomeone in the light\n\nSomeone in my hallway\n\nSomeone wearin' a new hat\n\nSomeone on the floor outside\n\nThey say you don't come back from that\n\n\n\nInto the light of a bad dream\n\nInto the laughter of a war\n\nEngland a sedative on my tongue\n\nGoodbye, goodbye that's all\n\nGoodbye, goodbye that's all",
