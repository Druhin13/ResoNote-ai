  "lyrics": "I don't understand why\r\nMost of the time\r\nI'm living my life all wrong\r\nI felt nothing at all\r\nThe freedom of the fall\r\nMy smile is on the backseat, the back wall\n\n\n\nWatch me as I go and separate the ones that I am made to love and hate\n\nAnd slowly counting down my body weight\n\nI'm tired\n\nI'm tired\n\n\n\nI can do things\n\nNo human can do\n\nI can doubt myself and then I'll doubt you\n\nThat's nothing new\n\n\n\nWatch me as I go and separate the ones that I am made to love and hate\n\nAnd slowly counting down my body weight\n\nI'm tired\n\nWatch me as I go and separate the ones that I am made to love and hate\n\nAnd slowly counting down my body weight\n\nI'm tired\n\nI'm tired\n\n\n\nAnd the stars, they look like little mice\n\nTo me, I am my only vice\n\nSat on a dead man's bench\n\nThe sun cools my neck\n\nIt covers my skin\n\nThe earth pulls me back\n\nHow 'bout that?\n\n\n\nWatch me as I go and separate the ones that I am made to love and hate\n\nAnd slowly counting down my body weight\n\nI'm tired\n\nWatch me as I go and separate the ones that I am made to love and hate\n\nAnd slowly counting down my body weight\n\nI'm tired\n\nI'm tired",
