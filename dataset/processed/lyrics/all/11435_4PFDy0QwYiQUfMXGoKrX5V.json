  "lyrics": "It's too cold tonight, I can't breathe\r\nIf you ripped me open, would you find anything to keep?\r\nI'm an empty shell and I've been trying to help\r\nAll the ones that I love, but I'm just a body, I am nothing\r\nCall, call for, my courage has been missing\n\nCall, call for help, I can't do this myself\n\n\n\nI am meaningless, I serve no purpose\n\nI am meaningless, I serve no purpose\n\nFoxes near the backyard, dancing in the road\n\nStare outside the window, they radiate a glow\n\n\n\nI gotta be worth something, I gotta be\n\nI gotta be worth something, I gotta be, I gotta be\n\nStare outside the window, stuck here all alone\n\nThey radiate a glow, it's so beautiful\n\n\n\nI don't even know who I am, I don't even know who I am\n\n\n\nTonight you will find me, along the lakeside\n\nFlipping nickels and dimes\n\nTonight you will find me, along the lakeside\n\nFlipping nickels and dimes for the rest of my life\n\n\n\nIt's too cold tonight, I can't breathe\n\nIf you ripped me open, would you find anything?\n\nI don't even know who I am, I don't even know who I am\n\nI don't even know\n\nCall, call for help",
