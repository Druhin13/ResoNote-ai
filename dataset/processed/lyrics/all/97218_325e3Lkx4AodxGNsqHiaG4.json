  "lyrics": "I've just seen a ghost\r\nThe memories I hate the most\r\nReflections I feel\r\nWere something I forgot were real\r\nA little view of the past\n\nI promise all of this is not gonna last\n\nTrust me, I know\n\n\n\nYa no quiero que llores\n\nThe universe is gonna give you muchas flores\n\nQuítate ese miedo\n\nYou'll be a lot more, trust me, yo te entiendo\n\n\n\nMama, I apologize\n\nI'm not what you thought in your mind\n\nBut I promise I'll be\n\nWorth all the love that you gave me\n\n\n\nAmbar, you will make it far\n\nAll of the wishes that you begged from the star\n\nThey will come true\n\n\n\nYa no quiero que llores\n\nThe universe is gonna give you muchas flores\n\nQuítate ese miedo\n\nYou'll be a lot more, trust me, yo te entiendo\n\n\n\nI know times are hard right now\n\nBut I promise you'll be all right\n\n\n\nYa no quiero que llores\n\nThe universe is gonna give you muchas flores",
