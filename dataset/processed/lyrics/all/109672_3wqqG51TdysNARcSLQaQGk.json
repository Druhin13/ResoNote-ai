  "lyrics": "From this moment, life has begun\r\nFrom this moment, you are the one\r\nRight beside you is where I belong\r\nFrom this moment on\r\nLooks like we made it\n\nLook how far we've come, my baby\n\nWe might've took the long way\n\nWe knew we'd get there someday\n\nThey said, \"I bet they'll never make it\"\n\nBut just look at us holding on\n\nWe're still together, still going strong\n\n\n\nI give my hand to you with all my heart\n\nI can't wait to live my life with you\n\nCan't wait to start\n\nYou and I will never be apart\n\nMy dreams came true because of you\n\n\n\nFrom this moment, I have been blessed\n\nI live only for your happiness\n\nAnd for your love I'd give my last breath\n\n\n\nBut just look at us holding on\n\nWe're still together\n\nFrom this moment on\n\n\n\nYou're still the one\n\nYou're still the one I run to\n\nThe one that I belong to\n\nYou're still the one I want for life\n\nYou're still the one\n\nYou're still the one that I love\n\nThe only one I dream of\n\nYou're still the one I kiss good night\n\n\n\nAnd you're the reason I believe in love\n\nAnd you're the answer to my prayers from up above\n\nAll we need is just the two of us\n\nMy dreams came true because of you\n\n\n\nSo glad we made it\n\nLook how far we've come, my baby\n\nI will love you as long as I live\n\nFrom this moment on",
