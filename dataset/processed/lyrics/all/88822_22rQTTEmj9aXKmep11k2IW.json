  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Forgotten Love par Aurora\r\nCan you tell if I’m cold?\nIf I’m out of daydreams?\nIf I lose what is loved?\nWill a new love awake me?\nI am touched by wonder\nWhen I'm blind in the dark\n\nBut you drown me in daylight\nDon’t swim with me darling\nI prefer the sound of you\nWhen you are away\n\nIf I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die\nIt's the beauty in forgotten love\nAnd I don't care if you don't understand why I cry\n\nIt's the beauty in forgotten love\n\nI forget how emotions dance when they aren’t inside of me\nI forget how the sun feels when she isn’t around me\nAnd my dreams become sweeter when something is missing\nI’m in love with the hunt itself\nIt makes me feel alive, alive\n\nIf I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die\nIt's the beauty in forgotten love\nAnd I don't care if you don't understand why I cry\nIt's the beauty in forgotten love\n\nReslianna Faresuu\n\nHongaaah firlessiranna\nFaressu hongaaah\nFirelessinaniree suranna\nRukireee rukireee\nResilanna faresuu\nHungaaah\nFirelessina firelessina firelessina\n\nI release my body and there is no ghost of you inside my mind\nI am moving on and thank God you let me try\nYou are the reason I can dance\nWithin a fire of goodbyes, of goodbyes\nI can lie in a dark room without the feeling that I’m lonely\nOh, (it’s the beauty in forgotten love)\n\nIf I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die\n\nIt's the beauty in forgotten love\nAnd I don't care if you don't understand why I cry\nIt's the beauty in forgotten love\nOh, oh, oh, oh, ah (it’s the beauty in forgotten love)\nOh, oh, oh, oh, ah (it’s the beauty in forgotten love)",
