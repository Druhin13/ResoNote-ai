  "lyrics": "Well there’s no use crying for the mill you spill\r\nIf you don’t slip and tumble someone will\r\nLoving’s just a name for saving face\r\nAnd running’s just the way I won the race\r\nThere’s no use turning on the local news\n\nWind and weather happens just to you\n\nWith the matchbooks and the numbers of your friends\n\nThe paper pieces burning at both ends\n\n\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well\n\nNo you don’t go kissing if you tell\n\nNo I won’t come running at the ringing of the bell\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well\n\n\n\nSo you sold your soul and now you’re on the run\n\nArcade tokens and a smokin’ gun\n\nHow far can that get you if you ran\n\nYou know the police catch you if they can\n\n\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well\n\nNo you don’t go kissing if you tell\n\nNo I won’t come running at the ringing of the bell\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well\n\n\n\nWell I walk the line and I stood by my man\n\nThe ring of fire burned me in my hand\n\nBeneath the neon moon I’m in the light\n\nTell me do I ever cross your mind\n\n\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well\n\nNo you don’t go kissing if you tell\n\nNo i won’t come running at the ringing of the bell\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well\n\nNo you don’t throw wishes to the well",
