  "lyrics": "Mama said, there'll be Boys like you. Tearing my Heart in two. Doing what you do, best.\r\nTaking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies. But with you, I can't resist. \nBefore I met you, I never felt good enough. Before I let you in, I'd already given up. Left on read, no reply, left me just, wondering why. Now I'm skeptical of Love.\r\nSo when you hold my hand, do you wanna hold my heart? When you say you want me, is it all of me, just one part? \n\nSo when you hold my hand, do you wanna hold my heart? When you say you want me,..\n\n\n\nMama said there'll be Boys like you, tearing my Heart in two. \n\nDoing what you do, best. \n\nTaken me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies. But with you, I can't resist.\n\nMaybe Mama doesn't always know best. \n\n\n\nI'm terrified, but I'll never let you know. Social suicide, if I ever let it show. \n\nEverything feels just right. \n\nI fall in place. \n\nWe fall in line. \n\nI'll never let you go! \n\n\n\nSo when you hold my Hand, do you wanna hold my Heart? When you say you want me, is it all of me, just one part? \n\nSo when you hold my Hand, do you wanna hold my Heart? When you say you want me,\n\nIs it all of me... yeah..\n\n\n\nMama said there'll be Boys like you, tearing my Heart in two. Doing what you do, best. \n\nTaking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies. But with you I can't resist. \n\nMaybe Mama doesn't always know best! \n\n\n\nSo when you hold me, (When you hold me) am I the only one. \n\nDo you wanna know me, (do you wanna know me) or this is all just for fun.\n\n\n\nMama said there'll be Boys like you, tearing my Heart in two. \n\nDoing what you do, best. \n\nTaking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies. \n\nBut with you, I can't resist. (No, No) \n\nMaybe Mama doesn't only know best. \n\n\n\nMama said there'll be Boys like you, too good to be true. (Mmm) \n\nDoing what you do best. \n\nTaking me for a ride, telling me pretty little lies. \n\nBut for you, for you, for you, I'll take that risk.",
