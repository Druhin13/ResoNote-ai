  "lyrics": "In time, I'll be hanging on your nightstand by myself\r\nAs I sit in the dust while you lay with someone else\r\nAnd I wish that you could feel how it felt\r\nKnowing I am just an ornament on your shelf\r\nHonestly, you never needed this\n\nI know you've got more that you're dealing with\n\nI'm just a burden I know that\n\nI just wish that I could go back\n\nFunny how everything changes\n\nOld feelings, new faces\n\nThey say home is where you make it\n\nResided in you, now it's vacant\n\n\n\nCause every single day I wanna blame myself\n\nI'm with you when you sleep but you're with someone else\n\nAnd every single day you see my colors fade\n\nI'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away\n\nAnd I can feel the pain when you see my face\n\nAnd you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing\n\nEvery single day you see my colors fade\n\nI'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away\n\n\n\nNow you gotta keep it all in like it's all good\n\nBut everything changed when you let me know it could\n\nAnd if you could take it back I know you would\n\nWon't throw me away when you know you should\n\n\n\nTell me what's real, is it all in my head?\n\nEvery night, every word that I said\n\nThey say move on but I'm better off dead\n\nHow can I sleep when I'm next to your bed?\n\nHow can you keep me confined in a frame?\n\nMemories fading, the faces will change\n\nBut I still live in your head so I stay\n\nNext to your bed, watch me wither away\n\n\n\nCause every single day I wanna blame myself\n\nI'm with you when you sleep but you're with someone else\n\nAnd every single day you see my colors fade\n\nI'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away\n\nAnd I can feel the pain when you see my face\n\nAnd you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing\n\nEvery single day you see my colors fade\n\nI'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away\n\n\n\nAll alone\n\nIn time, I'll be hanging on your nightstand by myself\n\nAnd I gather dust alone on your shelf\n\n\n\nCause every single day I wanna blame myself\n\nI'm with you when you're sleeping, you're with someone else\n\nEvery single day you see my colors fade\n\nI'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away\n\nAnd I can feel the pain when you see my face\n\nAnd you can close the drawer but that won't change a thing\n\nEvery single day you see my colors fade\n\nI'm just that picture that you haven't thrown away\n\n\n\nHonestly, you never needed this\n\nI know you've got more that you're dealing with\n\nI'm just a burden I know that\n\nI just wish that I could go back\n\nFunny how everything changes\n\nOld feelings new faces\n\nThey say home is where you make it\n\nResided in you, now it's vacant\n\n\n\nHonestly, you never needed this\n\nI know you've got more that you're dealing with\n\nI'm just a burden I know that\n\nI just wish that I could go back\n\nHonestly, you never needed this\n\nI know you've got more that you're dealing with\n\nHonestly, you never needed this\n\nHonestly, you never needed this",
