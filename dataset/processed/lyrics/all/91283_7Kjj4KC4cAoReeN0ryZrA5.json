  "lyrics": "Cal, you're bringing out the worst out of me\r\nTune in and out of your frequency\r\nFuck the weather\r\nThe sun is never shining down on me\r\nCal, I wish that I had a plan\n\nI just get high and lay in my bed\n\nWrite in excess over days 'til your jet plane flies away\n\n\n\nI know I should've expected it\n\nBut I'm just a fucking kid\n\nAnother time on my phone again\n\nAnd I don't know why I'm even trying\n\n\n\nCame around, head in the clouds again\n\nThinking too loud, can't hear a word that you say\n\nYou said Cal, you're driving into a dead end\n\nPlayed a game, now it's all pretend\n\nThe sun sets on the horizon\n\nFor you\n\n\n\nI know I should've expected it\n\nBut I'm just a fucking kid\n\nAnother time on my phone again\n\nAnd I don't know why I'm even trying",
