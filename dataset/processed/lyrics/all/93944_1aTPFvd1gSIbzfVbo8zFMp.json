  "lyrics": "I've been so many places in my life and time\r\nI've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad climbs\r\nI've acted out my life in stages with ten thousand people watching\r\nOh, but we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you\r\nI know your image of me is what I hope to be, I've treated you unkindly\r\nOh, but Darling can't you see that, there's no one more important to me\n\nBaby, baby, can't you see through me, 'cause we're alone now\n\nAnd I'm singing this song to you, you taught me precious secrets\n\nOf a true love withholding nothing, you came out in front\n\nWhen I was hiding, yeah, yeah, but now its so much better\n\nIf my words don't quite come together, please listen to the melody\n\n'Cause my love is in there somewhere hiding\n\nI love you in a place where there is no space or time, I love you for my life\n\nYou are a friend of mine, and when my life is over\n\nRemember, remember, remember when we were together\n\nAnd we are alone now, and I was singing this song to you\n\nWe were alone, and I was singing, yeah singing\n\nWe were alone, and I was singing this song for you\n\nSinging my song, I'm singing my song for you",
