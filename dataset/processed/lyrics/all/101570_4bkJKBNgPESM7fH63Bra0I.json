  "lyrics": "You need to get this straight\r\nI will never cooperate with you\r\nYou try to control me\r\nAnd the pain I feel seems to make you happy\r\nFuck that\n\nI'm down so low I've got nothing to lose\n\nWon't put thoughts in my head trying to tell me what to do\n\nFuck that\n\nAnd every step you think I'm under your shoe\n\nIf you're breaking my back, I'll be breaking yours too\n\n\n\nIf you've got something to prove\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\nIf you've got something to prove\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\n\n\nHere we go again\n\nYou think you're in my head and under my skin\n\nThere's nothing you can throw at me\n\nYou can't win against my kind of crazy\n\n\n\nFuck that\n\nI'm down so low I've got nothing to lose\n\nWon't put thoughts in my head trying to tell me what to do\n\nAnd every step you think I'm under your shoe\n\nIf you're breaking my back, I'll be breaking yours too\n\n\n\nIf you've got something to prove\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\nIf you've got something to prove\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\n\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\n\n\nSo if you've got something to prove\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\nIf you've got something to prove\n\nYou against me, me against you\n\nYou against me, me against you",
