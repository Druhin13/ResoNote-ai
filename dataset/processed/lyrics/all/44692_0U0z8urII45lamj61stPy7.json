  "lyrics": "Heavy is the head that wears the crown\r\nAll the people came to hear him speak from miles around\r\nThey hug on every word a song in every sound\r\nHeavy is the head that wears the crown\r\nHe touched the sky to light up all the stars\n\nHe could snap his fingers and catch lightning in a jar\n\nI am you and you are me and we are who we are\n\nTouch the sky and light up all the stars\n\n\n\nAll hail the king whose castle's falling down\n\nThe paper prince who wears a cardboard crown\n\nPoor man has his money, rich man has his gold\n\nAll hail the king whose fortune is his soul\n\n\n\nHe climbed the clouds to heaven's highest hill\n\nWhen you get that high the earth below looks just like a blue pill\n\nGave wind to all his horses and to all his men good will\n\nWhen he climbed down from heaven's highest hill\n\n\n\nAll hail the king whose castle's falling down\n\nThe paper prince who wears a cardboard crown\n\nPoor man has his money, rich man has his gold\n\nAll hail the king whose fortune is his soul\n\n\n\nHe breathed his last, they laid him in the ground\n\nFalse prophets spoke of riches and said all hail to us now\n\nThe faithful wouldn't listen and they never would bow down\n\nHe breathed his last, they laid him in the ground\n\n\n\nAll hail the king whose castle's falling down\n\nThe paper prince who wears a cardboard crown\n\nPoor man has his money, rich man has his gold\n\nAll hail the king whose fortune is his soul",
