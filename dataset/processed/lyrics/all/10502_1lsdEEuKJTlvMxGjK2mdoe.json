  "lyrics": "My mama told me, \"You got it goin' on\r\nSome day you'll be a star on the big screen\"\r\nNext day the phone rings\r\nI said, \"What took so long?\"\r\nI hopped in my new car, chasin' big dreams\r\nSo I strutted right into the room\n\nI said, \"Mr. Record Man, look what I can do\"\n\nHe said, \"Skin so black, \" and just like that\n\nAll of my dreams came true\n\nHe said, \"I don't know what it is but girl you got it\"\n\nYou got it, so I got it\n\n\"So welcome to the biz', sign your name on the dotted line\n\nIt's your time in the spotlight\"\n\nNever did feel so hypnotic\n\nAnd the world made room for the girl with the silver spoon\n\nMwah",
