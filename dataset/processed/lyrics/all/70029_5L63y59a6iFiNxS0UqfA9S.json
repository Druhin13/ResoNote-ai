  "lyrics": "I can see myself repeating\r\nStepping in the same old holes\r\nWhich I made myself so long ago\r\nWhy I don't even know\r\nWhy do I work to keep my breath in\n\nIf I don't ever let it go\n\nI fear my heart can be deceiving\n\nIt shows that I've got time to grow\n\n\n\nI know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nWhen you realise you've thrown it all\n\nAnd I know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nWhen you're beaten down and can't go on\n\n\n\nI've been beating ‘round the bushes\n\nAnd burning my own bridges\n\nI see that I'm doing all wrong\n\n\n\nI know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nSo wonder will I ever learn\n\nOh I wonder will I ever learn\n\n\n\nHow it can change in a conversation\n\nFrom day to night from dusk to dawn\n\nAnd even I knew it was my turn\n\nTo pick it up and toss the ball\n\n\n\nIt went by from top to bottom\n\nJust when I took that wrong turn south\n\nAnd I don't know the hell I'm going\n\nBut I guess I won't be found\n\n\n\nI know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nWhen you realise you've thrown it all\n\nAnd I know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nWhen you're beaten down and can't go on\n\n\n\nI've been beating ‘round the bushes\n\nAnd burning my own bridges\n\nI see that I'm doing all wrong\n\n\n\nI know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nSo wonder will I ever learn\n\nOh I wonder will I ever learn\n\n\n\nYou would think I'd know by now\n\nJust about the hundred time\n\nBut I guess it never really sunk in\n\nOr stuck with me\n\n\n\nI know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nWhen you realise you've thrown it all\n\nAnd I know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nWhen you're beaten down and can't go on\n\n\n\nI've been beating ‘round the bushes\n\nAnd burning my own bridges\n\nI see that I'm doing all wrong\n\n\n\nI know that feeling\n\nI know that feeling\n\nSo wonder will I ever learn\n\nOh I wonder will I ever learn\n\nOh I wonder will I ever learn",
