  "lyrics": "I want to say I learned something valuable today\r\nAlas, my murdered remains are incapable of learning anything\r\nTrusted you\r\nI should have never trusted you\r\nIn fact I never did\r\nWhat's the use\n\nI'm not complaining\n\nI'm not anything\n\n\n\nIs this what's supposed to happen\n\nWhen you're only trying to do right in this wicked world?\n\nProbably I should already know this\n\nProbably I should graciously accept what I get\n\n\n\nMost people wouldn't hang the corpses up for review\n\nDearest, I can only hope most people are nothing like you\n\nNervous tics\n\nThat I pretended not to see\n\nThat's how I was brought up\n\nWarning signs\n\nDeath metal albums\n\n\"Hang in there, baby\" poster\n\n\n\nIs this how you thank somebody\n\nFor their selfless loyalty? Is this what you do?\n\nPardon me for failing to grasp how this works\n\nExcuse my breathtaking ignorance\n\n\n\nIs this what's supposed to happen\n\nWhen you're only trying to do right in this wicked world?\n\nProbably I should already know this\n\nProbably I should graciously accept what I get",
