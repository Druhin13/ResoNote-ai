  "lyrics": "In the garden of our Savior no flower grows unseen\r\nHis kindness rains like water on every humble seed\r\nNo simple act of mercy escapes His watchful eye\r\nFor there is One who sees me\r\nHis hand is over mine\n\nIn the kingdom of the heavens no suffering is unknown\n\nEach tear that falls is holy, each breaking heart a throne\n\nThere is a song of beauty in every weeping eye\n\nFor there is One who knows me\n\nHis heart, it breaks with mine\n\n\n\nO the deeds forgotten, O the works unseen\n\nEvery drink of water flowing graciously\n\nEvery tender mercy Youâ€™re making glorious\n\nThis You have asked of us:\n\nDo little things with great love\n\nLittle things with great love\n\n\n\nAt the table of our Savior, no mouth will go unfed\n\nAnd His children in the shadows stream in and raise their heads\n\nO give us ears to hear them, and give us eyes that see\n\nFor there is One who loves them. I am His hands and feet",
