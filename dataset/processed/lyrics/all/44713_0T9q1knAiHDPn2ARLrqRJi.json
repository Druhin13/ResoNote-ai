  "lyrics": "I used to spend my nights out in a barroom\nLiquor was the only love I've known\nBut you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom\nAnd brought me back from being too far gone\n\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\n\nYou're as sweet as strawberry wine\n\nYou're as warm as a glass of brandy\n\nAnd honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time\n\n\n\nI've looked for love in all the same old places\n\nFound the bottom of a bottle always dry\n\nBut when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it\n\nÂ‘Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high\n\n\n\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\n\nYou're as sweet as strawberry wine\n\nYou're as warm as a glass of brandy\n\nAnd honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time\n\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\n\nYou're as sweet as strawberry wine\n\nYou're as warm as a glass of brandy\n\nAnd honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time\n\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\n\nas Tennessee whiskey, as Tennessee whiskey\n\nYou're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey\n\nas Tennessee whiskey\n\n\n\nas Tennessee whiskey",
