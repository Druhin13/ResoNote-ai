  "lyrics": "What do you ache for\r\nI ache for wonder\r\nStill I wait til that place calls\r\nTo take me under\r\nBut I beg for your mercy fear it's safer here than below\n\nAs I'm losing control I steer my ship into the unknown\n\n\n\nNow we sail into deep blue storm clouds\n\nOverhead now strangely I feel at peace as I dive into\n\nMy underworld, world\n\nI dive into my underworld, world\n\n\n\nDown in these depths I'm adding the numbers\n\nOf all I've suffered in past lives tied down in the darkness\n\nFinally I begin to learn what I've returned tonight\n\nTime has come to begin again leave something else behind\n\n\n\nNow we sail into deep blue storm clouds\n\nOverhead now strangely I feel at peace as I dive into\n\nMy underworld, world\n\nI dive into my underworld, world\n\n\n\nI remember I know this place\n\nSo I separate every life\n\nYou can have too [?]\n\nWhat we can't deny is our heart\n\nThis is where our ship is skinned of all beliefs\n\nAnd I surface as a better man\n\nAt the depths of winter\n\n\n\nSo I release and retrieve my courage from my sleeve\n\n\n\nSo these deep blue storm clouds\n\nOverhead now strangely I feel at peace\n\nAs I dive into\n\nMy underworld, world\n\nI dive into my underworld, world\n\nI dive into\n\nMy underworld",
