  "lyrics": "This is not the end\r\nIts the start\r\nAnd all that's broken mends\r\nAnd that came apart\r\nAnd I looked into your eyes\r\nAnd I saw fear of hurt, because of me\n\nOh but with uncertainty\n\nAnd I looked into your eyes\n\nAnd you lied\n\n\n\nIf you fall, you fall\n\nI will never let you go\n\nIf you fall, you fall\n\nI will never let you go\n\nOo Oo\n\n\n\nSo you start again\n\nPick up where you stopped\n\nYou beg to be like them\n\nBut still refuse to knock\n\nAnd i heard you when you called\n\nHeard you saying\n\nHope in what you cannot see\n\nHope is not some guarantee\n\nOh I heard you when you're close\n\nDo you hear me\n\n\n\nAnd you fall, you fall\n\nBut I will never let you go\n\nAnd you fall, you fall\n\nBut I will never let you go\n\n\n\nAnd you fall, you fall\n\nBut I will never let you go\n\nOo",
