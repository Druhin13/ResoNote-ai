  "lyrics": "You will say, all the time, what you think about\nAnd I stand, and I nod, and I wait around\nI'm gonna pull myself together and simplify some things\nAnd shut up\n\nYou overwork, all the time, and you're tired again\n\nAnd I stand, and I nod, and I sigh and stretch\n\nI'm gonna try and get a hair cut, a shampoo, and a shave\n\nAnd shut up\n\n\n\nI'm not here, I'm a drunk, and I'm on my own\n\nYou get up, put on your shoes, and you go on home\n\nI'm gonna watch you walk outside now, and make a stupid face\n\nAnd shut up",
