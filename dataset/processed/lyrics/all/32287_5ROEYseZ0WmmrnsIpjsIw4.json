  "lyrics": "Seen no sign of life ‘round here\r\nAll the curtains drawn, the streets are clear\r\nSeen no sign of life ‘round here\r\nAll the curtains drawn, the streets are clear\r\nTake a moment\r\nTo realize\n\n\n\nReading a sign that’s fading\n\nLost in between two places\n\nWe could’ve done more\n\nWe could’ve done more\n\n\n\nLook for the days we’ve wasted\n\nSwept up with you we waited\n\nWe could’ve done more\n\nWe could’ve done more\n\n\n\nSeen no sign of life ‘round here\n\nAll the curtains drawn, the streets are clear\n\nSeen no sign of life ‘round here\n\nAll the curtains drawn, the streets are clear\n\nTake a moment\n\n\n\nHear what we want to hear\n\nGot a lot we've yet to find\n\nBut the moment’s almost real gone\n\nSay what you’re gonna say\n\nWe’ve been lost and now we’re found\n\nNow the moment's almost real gone",
