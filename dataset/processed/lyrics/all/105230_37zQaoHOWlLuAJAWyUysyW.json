  "lyrics": "1st verse\r\nHer mother called and wondered where we were\r\nAnd why we didn't call her after church\r\nI told her that we had to hurry home\r\nCause this time of year there's always something going on\n\n1st chorus\n\nWe gotta deck the halls\n\nWe gotta find that box of broken balls\n\nThat angel and that tub of tangled lights\n\nPatch up the tree then fuss about where it oughta be\n\nI hate she missed us but we're all wrapped up in Christmas\n\n\n\n2nd verse\n\nAin't got time to watch a football game\n\nWe gotta listen to Bing and Elvis sing\n\nIt won't be long til Santa makes his run\n\nI better hurry up and get everything done\n\n\n\n2nd chorus\n\nI gotta sign those cards\n\nI gotta get that reindeer in the yard\n\nHang off the roof and change them burned out bulbs\n\nGotta spend it all between Wal-Mart and the mall\n\nIt could get vicious cause we're all wrapped up in Christmas\n\n\n\ntag\n\nHappy holidays\n\nMay joy and peace come your way\n\nOur best wishes\n\nNow go get all wrapped up in Christmas",
