  "lyrics": "Ships in the making\r\nBound for a distant shore\r\nWorld for the taking\r\nMen gone forever more\r\nBoarding and setting sail\r\nYet victory won't prevail\n\n\n\nFreeze the arrow in the air\n\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\n\nBe the first to turn around\n\nTake the leap to land on higher ground\n\n\n\nCall in, surrender\n\nStill, I won't feel like defeat\n\nMen laying down their swords\n\nEach of their own accord\n\n\n\nFreeze the arrow in the air\n\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\n\nBe the first to turn around\n\nTake the leap to land on higher ground\n\n\n\nRaise the battle to the sky\n\nFace the fear and hold your head up high\n\nOooh-oooh, oooh-oooh\n\nTake the leap like you were bound for higher ground\n\n\n\nFreeze the arrow in the air\n\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\n\n\n\nFreeze the arrow in the air\n\nMake your mark and leave it hanging there\n\nBe the first to turn around\n\nTake the leap to land on higher ground\n\nBe the first to turn around\n\nTake the leap and land on higher ground",
