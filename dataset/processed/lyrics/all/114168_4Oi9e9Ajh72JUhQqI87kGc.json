(pick up)\n\n\n\nI Been calling tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)\n\nFeeling lost and I don't know what to do\n\nSo can you can you get back to me?\n\nSo can you can you get back to me?\n\nSo can you can you get back to me?\n\n\n\nFamily issues make success bitter sweet\n\nSometimes a cold shoulder is the only way to deliver heat\n\nThats the situation that I'm in with my dad\n\nMe and my mom dip quick\n\nNo one lives with my dad\n\nYeah it's sad but he brought it onto himself\n\nLast time we talked, we didn't talk we just yell\n\nHe knows he got issues, he told me he's getting help\n\nTold dad I got to put the relationship on the shelf\n\nDid with what i delt\n\nWelp, boohoo right?\n\nI shouldn't care cause i got houses and some new coupes, right?\n\nBut money's not an adhesive that can take all the pieces of a broken family and put them back together\n\nAgreements ain't as loud as inner turmoil\n\nGet to the roots, replace any burnt soil\n\nWhile the world boils over fake problems with me\n\nI just need sixty, seconds\n\nYo god, hit me (please record your message)\n\n\n\nI Been calling tryna get a hold of you, you (yeah, yeah)\n\nFeeling lost and I don't know what to do\n\nSo can you can you get back to me?\n\nSo can you can you get back to me?\n\nSo can you can you get back to me?\n\n\n\nFuck\n\nI guess i'ma just keep calling\n\nOne of these days you gonna pick up, hopefully\n\nYeah",
