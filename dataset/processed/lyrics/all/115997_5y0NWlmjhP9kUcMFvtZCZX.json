  "lyrics": "Come all you young fellers, so young and so fine\r\nAnd seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine\r\nIt'll form like a habit and seep to your soul\r\n'Til the stream of your blood flows black as the coal\r\nIt's dark as the dungeons and damp as the dew\n\nWhere the dangers are double and the pleasures are few\n\nWhere the rain never falls, and the sun never shines\n\nIt's dark as the dungeons way down in the mines\n\n\n\nThere's many a man I have seen in my day\n\nWho live just to labor his whole life away\n\nLike a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine\n\nA man will have lust for the lure of the mine\n\n\n\nIt's dark as the dungeon and damp as the dew\n\nWhere the dangers are double and the pleasures are few\n\nWhere the rain never falls, and the sun never shines\n\nIt's dark as the dungeons way down in the mines\n\n\n\nCome midnight or morning, or middle of day\n\nIt's the same to the miner who labors away\n\nFor the demons of death often come by surprise\n\nOne fall of the slate, and you're buried alive\n\n\n\nFor it's dark as the dungeon and damp as the dew\n\nWhere the dangers are double and the pleasures are few\n\nWhere the rain never falls the sun never shines\n\nIt's dark as the dungeons way down in the mines\n\n\n\nI hope when I'm dead and the ages shall roll\n\nMy body will blacken and turn into coal\n\nI'll look from the door of my heavenly home\n\nAnd pity the miners who're digging my bones\n\n\n\nIt's dark as the dungeons and damp as the dew\n\nWhere the dangers are double and the pleasures are few\n\nAnd the rain never falls, and the sun never shines\n\nAs dark as the dungeons way down in the mines",
