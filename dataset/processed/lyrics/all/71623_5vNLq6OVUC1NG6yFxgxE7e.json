  "lyrics": "That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide\r\nThat hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive\r\nThat key under the mat, you know right where it's at\r\nIt's waiting with the porch light on\r\nDon't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home\r\nCome on home, my love is\n\n\n\nNever gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty\n\nNow until the day I die, unconditionally\n\nYou know I'm always gonna be here for ya\n\nNo one's ever gonna love you more than\n\nGod, your mama, and me\n\nGod, your mama, and me\n\nUnconditionally, God, your mama, and me\n\n\n\nLoud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio\n\nPraying with you every mile down any dead end road\n\nYou can tell me every secret that you been keeping\n\nI'll hold it, lock and key\n\nUp with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave\n\nYou better believe my love is\n\n\n\nNever gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty\n\nNow until the day I die, unconditionally\n\nYou know I'm always gonna be here for ya\n\nNo one's ever gonna love you more than\n\nGod, your mama, and me\n\nGod, your mama, and me\n\nUnconditionally, God, your mama, and me\n\n\n\nYou better believe it, you better believe it\n\nEvery step you take, I'll be as sure as your shadow\n\nEvery move you make, you know I'm part of you wherever you go\n\nBaby, you know my love is\n\n\n\nNever gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty\n\nNow until the day I die, unconditionally\n\nYou know I'm always gonna be here for ya\n\nNo one's ever gonna love you more than\n\nGod, your mama, and me\n\nGod, your mama, and me\n\nUnconditionally, God, your mama, and me",
