  "lyrics": "I'm writing to ask you; did you achieve all you wanted to do?\r\nBefore we were dragged up, something was different and nothing was new\r\nHow did you see me?\r\nWe didn't know what we wanted to be\r\nWhen did we move on?\r\nI didn't feel it, nobody told me\n\n\n\nTime to kill\n\nWas always an illusion\n\nTime stood still\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\n\n\nWe wrote our names along the bathroom walls\n\nGraffitiing our hearts across the stalls\n\nI've been waiting for my whole life to grow old\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\n\n\nStanding in streetlights, we didn't know wrong, didn't know right\n\nMaking a mess and running in circles, getting in fights\n\nWe were just kids then, we didn't know how and didn't know when\n\nTaking our chances, calling it off and starting again\n\n\n\nTime to kill\n\nWas always an illusion\n\nTime stood still\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\n\n\nWe wrote our names along the bathroom walls\n\nGraffitiing our hearts across the stalls\n\nI've been waiting for my whole life to grow old\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\n\n\nNever will\n\nNever will\n\n\n\nWe wrote our names along the bathroom walls\n\nGraffitiing our hearts across the stalls\n\nI've been waiting for my whole life to grow old\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will\n\nAnd now we never will, never will",
