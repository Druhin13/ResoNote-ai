I don't know.)\n\n\n\nSo tell me how you really feel now\n\nAin't been asked that in a while\n\nYet you still won't get them hear you out\n\nJust keep at it, bro, these things always seem to fix themselves somehow\n\nSuck it up, some would kill just to stand\n\nWhere you're standing now\n\n\n\nSo how you gonna scream my name?\n\nWhen I gave all I got\n\nI've nothing left to give you\n\nAnd I'm so burnt out and lost\n\n'Cause fuck it, it all feels the same\n\nAnd I got all I want\n\nI thought that I'd feel something\n\nI guess I'll never know\n\nHow to live with a good thing\n\nFuck my life up for nothing, nothing\n\n'Cause you don't care if I'm still bleeding\n\nYou just scream until you hear my name\n\n\n\nSo this is how I die now\n\nHands to the air\n\nNo, they can't stop the sky falling down, down\n\nGuess I thought that I'd feel good somehow\n\n\n\nDisappearing through the silence\n\nScreams fade and blur\n\nConversated with the smile, though\n\nLife invisible\n\nGuess I thought that I'd feel better now somehow\n\nAny hour now",
