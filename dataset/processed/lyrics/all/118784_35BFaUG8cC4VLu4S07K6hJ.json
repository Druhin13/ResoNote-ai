  "lyrics": "Last night I dreamed that I was a child\r\nOut where the pines grow wild and tall\r\nI was trying to make it home through the forest\r\nBefore the darkness falls \nI heard the wind rustling through the trees\r\nAnd ghostly voices rose from the fields\n\nI ran with my heart pounding down that broken path\n\nWith the devil snappin' at my heels\n\n\n\nI broke through the trees, and there in the night\n\nMy father's house stood shining hard and bright\n\nThe branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms\n\nBut I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms\n\n\n\nI awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart\n\nWill never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts\n\nI got dressed, and to that house I did ride \n\nFrom out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light\n\n\n\nI walked up the steps and stood on the porch\n\nA woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door\n\nI told her my story, and who I'd come for\n\nShe said \"I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore\"\n\n\n\nMy father's house shines hard and bright\n\nIt stands like a beacon calling me in the night\n\nCalling and calling, so cold and alone\n\nShining `cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned",
