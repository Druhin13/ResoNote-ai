  "lyrics": "Maybe we'll never learn\r\nThe fire at the gates is our saving grace\r\nRemember we were born to burn?\r\nThere is a holy hell where we can save ourselves\r\nThere is a holy hell where we can save ourselves\n\nWe will be cast out of paradise\n\nIt’s a long ascent out of the black\n\nBut we all have to sacrifice\n\nHang the iconoclast\n\nAnd kiss the feet of the amnesiac\n\n‘Cause the moment is dead when I’m lost in the past \n\n\n\nMaybe we'll never learn\n\nThe fire at the gates is our saving grace\n\nRemember we were born to burn?\n\nThere is a holy hell where we can save ourselves\n\n\n\nBut now the rivers are running red\n\nAnd the skies have been set ablaze\n\nI’ve been fearing the worst again\n\nHeavenly terrorist\n\nHave you been mourning over yesterday?\n\nDon’t forget to breathe when the knife begins to twist\n\nFuck this self pity\n\nIt’s not that hard to see\n\nWe get one chance\n\nThese wounds will set me free \n\nThere’s poison on the key\n\nIt brings you to your knees\n\n\n\nBut even the mountains erode in the rain\n\nA single spark can start a forest fire\n\nLight one match and burn down the empire\n\nThere's gold buried in the blue, oh\n\nThere's gold buried in the blue\n\n\n\nHolding on, I've got nothing left to lose\n\nAnd I can tell there's gold buried in the blue\n\n\n\nMaybe we'll never learn\n\nThe fire at the gates is our saving grace\n\nRemember we were born to burn\n\nThere is a holy hell where we can save ourselves\n\n\n\nHolding on, I've got nothing left to lose\n\nAnd I can tell there's gold buried in the blue\n\n\n\nBut even the mountains erode in the rain\n\nA single spark can start a forest fire\n\nWe weren't meant to burn down the empire\n\nThere's gold buried in the blue\n\nThere's gold buried in the blue",
