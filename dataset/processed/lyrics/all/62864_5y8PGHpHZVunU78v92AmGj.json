  "lyrics": "Mondays, you're cold\r\nNot even the thought of me crosses your mind\r\nTuesdays, i'm old news\r\nSay you moved on cause our love has expired\r\nWednesday came and Thursday went away\r\nBut Friday nights reminded you of me\n\n\n\nWhy is it on the weekend you get all weak\n\nAnd blowing up my phone\n\nSaying you hate being alone?\n\nWhy when you were the one that said we were done?\n\nI should be blowing up your phone\n\nSaying i hate being alone\n\n\n\nYou must love breaking my heart\n\nIt's your favourite game\n\nYou must love pulling me apart\n\nIt's your favourite game\n\n\n\nIt's like i'm the dice\n\nYou keep on gambling me all the time\n\nI can't deny that\n\nI'd bet a million to see you tonight\n\nBut I know its a weekday so you won't reply\n\nYou know that you'd rather keep me hanging on the line\n\n\n\nWhy is it on the weekend you get all weak\n\nStart blowing up my phone\n\nSaying you hate being alone?\n\nWhy when you were the one that said we we're done?\n\nI should be blowing up your phone\n\nSaying I hate being alone\n\n\n\nYou must love breaking my heart\n\nIt's your favourite game\n\nYou must love pulling me apart\n\nIt's your favourite game\n\n\n\nWhy is it on the weekend you get all weak\n\nStart blowing up my phone\n\nSaying you hate being alone\n\nWhy when you were the one that said we were done\n\nI should be blowing up your phone\n\nSaying I hate being alone\n\n\n\nYou must love breaking my heart\n\nIt's your favourite game\n\nYou must love pulling me apart\n\nIt's your favourite game",
