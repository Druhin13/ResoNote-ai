  "lyrics": "My friend hates needles, but he's not chicken\r\nKnows all the statistics, and his chance is slim\r\nMaking up excuses just to buy tin foil\r\nAnd erode all of the meat around his gangly core\r\nI know a lot of men in hardcore bands\r\nCollectively funding the Colombians\n\nStraight-edge guys who turn to weed and beer\n\nNow they all got divorced and they all grow beards\n\n\n\nNot me, I'm a pill man\n\nNot me, I'm a pill man\n\nNot me, it's a thrill man\n\nNot me, I like my pills\n\n\n\nSome say it's a simple and a sterile crutch\n\nA number on the bottle and three lines of dust\n\nKilling brain cells in increments\n\nJust to reel it all in 'til it all makes sense\n\nSo ya' like to have a drink knowing you might drown\n\nIn the Friday's bar where the dead go down\n\nTake opioids or your home spun meth\n\nOr claim that tripping helps you write the best\n\n\n\nNot me, I'm a pill man\n\nNot me, I'm a pill man\n\nNot me, it's a thrill man\n\nNot me, I like\n\nNot me, I like\n\nNot me, I like my pills\n\n\n\nNot me, I'm a pill man (The pills, not me)\n\nNot me, I'm a pill man (You made your choice now)\n\nNot me, I'm a fill man (Ooooh...)\n\nHey, whoa!\n\nNot me (You let me be)\n\nNot me (Won't deal no more)\n\n(Ooooh...)\n\nI'm a pill man\n\n\n\nNot me (The pills, not me)\n\nNot me (You made your choice now)\n\nNot me",
