Who would you die for?\n\nList their names in the stars\n\nWho would you lie for? Who would you lie for?\n\nIs she laying in your arms?\n\nSweet summer sweat like you could never forget\n\nI'm gonna figure this out\n\nBefore we all close our eyes and drift into the night\n\n\n\nIts been said he was the bravest elephant\n\nDon't let em fool ya or try to school ya\n\nJust be yourself and no one else\n\nAnd when we meet again i'll be the bravest elephant\n\n\n\nWho would you die for? Who would you die for?\n\nList their names in the stars\n\nWho would you lie for? Who would you lie for?\n\nIs she laying in your arms?\n\nSweet summer sweat, like you could never forget\n\nI'm gonna figure this out\n\nBefore we all close our eyes and drift into the night\n\n\n\nWho would you die for? Who would you die for?\n\nList their names in the stars\n\nWho would you lie for? Who would you lie for?\n\nIs she laying in your arms?\n\nSweet summer sweat, like you could never forget\n\nI'm gonna figure this out\n\nBefore we all close our eyes and drift into the night\n\n\n\nDear Saint we miss you so\n\nWhere do all the legends go?",
