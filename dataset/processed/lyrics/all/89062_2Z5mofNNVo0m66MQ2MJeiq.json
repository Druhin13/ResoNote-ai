  "lyrics": "There's another world inside of me \nThat you may never see \nThere're secrets in this life \nThat I can't hide \nSomewhere in this darkness \nThere's a light that I can't find \n\nMaybe it's too far away... \n\nMaybe I'm just blind... \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just blind... \n\n\n\n[chorus] \n\nSo hold me when I'm here \n\nRight me when I'm wrong \n\nHold me when I'm scared \n\nAnd love me when I'm gone \n\nEverything I am \n\nAnd everything in me \n\nWants to be the one \n\nYou wanted me to be \n\nI'll never let you down \n\nEven if I could \n\nI'd give up everything \n\nIf only for your good \n\nSo hold me when I'm here \n\nRight me when I'm wrong \n\nYou can hold me when I'm scared \n\nYou won't always be there \n\nSo love me when I'm gone \n\n[end chorus] \n\n\n\nLove me when I'm gone... \n\n\n\nWhen your education x-ray \n\nCan not see under my skin \n\nI won't tell you a damn thing \n\nThat I could not tell my friends \n\nRoaming through this darkness \n\nI'm alive but I'm alone \n\nPart of me is fighting this \n\nBut part of me is gone \n\n\n\n[chorus] \n\n\n\nMaybe I'm just blind... \n\n\n\n[chorus] \n\n\n\nLove me when I'm gone... \n\n\n\nLove me when I'm gone \n\nWhen I'm Gone \n\nWhen I'm Gone \n\nWhen I'm Gone",
