  "lyrics": "Reaching out\r\nReaching out\r\nBeen talking to myself for several hours\r\nAnd I keep on calling for a higher power\r\nI put another song on this record player\n\nDance 'til I'm drunk on a midnight prayer\n\nReaching out, but nobody comes\n\n\n\nThe girl who everyone knew\n\nIs now the one they look through\n\nAnd oh-\n\n\n\nSay another prayer for the lost and lonely\n\nReaching out\n\nDon't look away, stay and watch me slowly\n\nGive it up\n\nI feel myself falling away in silence\n\nFreaking out\n\nI know I can't do this alone anymore\n\nWon't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing\n\n\n\nWhat good are my memories, if I'm by myself?\n\nJumping in the hallway, think I'm needing help\n\nI had dreams, yeah I watched somebody\n\nTelevision man seems to think it's funny\n\nReaching out, but nobody comes\n\n\n\nThe girl who everyone knew\n\nIs now the one they look through\n\nAnd oh-\n\n\n\nSay another prayer for the lost and lonely\n\nReaching out\n\nDon't look away, stay and watch me slowly\n\nGive it up\n\nI feel myself falling away in silence\n\nFreaking out\n\nI know I can't do this alone anymore\n\nWon't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing\n\n\n\nWe could be amazing\n\nTogether we are strong\n\nAnd I know there's more lovin' blood in these veins\n\nSo don't forget me, we're all connected\n\nAnd no one needs to be alone\n\n\n\nSo say another prayer for the lost and lonely\n\nReaching out\n\nDon't look away, stay and watch me slowly\n\nGive it up\n\nI feel myself falling away in silence\n\nFreaking out\n\nI know I can't do this alone anymore\n\nWon't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing\n\nAnd no one needs to be alone\n\n\n\nSay another prayer for the lost and lonely\n\nReaching out\n\nDon't look away, stay and watch me slowly\n\nGive it up\n\nI feel myself falling away in silence\n\nFreaking out\n\nI know I can't do this alone anymore\n\nWon't you take my hand, 'cause we could be amazing\n\n\n\nReaching out\n\nReaching out\n\nReaching out",
