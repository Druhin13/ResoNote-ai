  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails par Louis Armstrong\r\nI just got an invitation through the mails:\n\"Your presence requested this evening, it's formal\nA top hat, a white tie and tails\"\nNothing now could take the wind out of my sails\nBecause I'm invited to step out this evening\nWith top hat, white tie and tails\n\nI'm puttin' on my top hat\nTyin' up my white tie\nBrushin' off my tails\n\nI'm dudein' up my shirt front\nPuttin' in the shirt studs\nPolishin' my nails\n\n\nI'm steppin' out, my dear\nTo breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class\nAnd I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas\n\nFor I'll be there\nPuttin' down my top hat\nMussin' up my white tie\nDancin' in my tails",
