  "lyrics": "My fist or this pistol nose\r\nTip on your grill so quick you'll be missing those\r\nPearly whites I take early flights\r\nHere's some advice: quit ya fuckery\r\nIs it Lacoste or a Polo night?\r\nMan that's cool yous a boss, I'm a prototype\n\nSolamente wordsmith touch the gente\n\nBars for so many I'm an honorary sensei\n\n\n\nThings I never thought about\n\nTrying to be elusive and the process get forgot about\n\nNo doubt I don't think about it, write it down\n\nLook what you made me do (the birds flew)\n\nOn my side of town I'm known to be truth\n\nGot the right light inside of the booth\n\nI see it all like a view from the roof\n\nGray and gray are both acceptable off liquor I'm loose\n\nThey clocking me but I don't watch what replicas do\n\n\n\nThere's so much evidence that we set a precedence\n\nFor Southern California residents\n\nI give you this inheritance of\n\nReal rap jewels in the form of amphetamines\n\n\n\nWhat's the difference from take-out and delivery? (what?)\n\nServe 'em at the spot or we bring it to them literally (yup)\n\nAnd it'll be a cold day in hell\n\nIf you hear about the evidence that Everett fell\n\n\n\nFade one, fade two, fade three\n\nNo matter how many tell 'em come see we\n\nFade one, fade two, fade three\n\nNo matter how many tell 'em come see we\n\n\n\nWho wanna see a RSE emcee?\n\nE to the V, off the mast a leaf in the tree\n\nAll you gotta do is give Evie a chance\n\nAnd I'm gonna light my plants\n\n\n\nThings I always thought about\n\nTrying to get my kids everything that they thought about\n\nI'm advance man I'm running routes (with runners)\n\nNFL scouts talk about\n\nProverbial I'm Nazareth\n\nBlack Jesus with words for infidels and hazardous\n\nIndividuals who underestimate Los Angeles\n\nSavages hear to take away your advantages\n\n\n\nI put my heart in everything I spit for analysts\n\nStill Los Angeles with candles lit and cannabis\n\nWhere I'm at, what I'm doing\n\nLeft off the old rocks and old ruins\n\nThe wait is over influence\n\nNever knew it going off stupid biz music\n\nMy greatest shit is my latest shit, go 'head and loop it\n\nStill make a killing for an underground rapper\n\nWater flows runny like nose of coke trappers\n\n\n\nFade one, fade two, fade three\n\nNo matter how many tell 'em come see we\n\nFade one, fade two, fade three\n\nNo matter how many tell 'em come see we",
