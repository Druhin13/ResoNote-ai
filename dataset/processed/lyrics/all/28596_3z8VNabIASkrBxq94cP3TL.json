  "lyrics": "The fire of love\r\nHas burned me through\r\nNo vow ever made\r\nYet I wasn't given to\r\nNow the bows are fading\n\nOn every gift she brings\n\nAnd I'm left alone to tremble\n\nLike a meadow [?]\n\n\n\nPerfect hands\n\nClaim what they will\n\nKnow how to hold a heart\n\nNot being still\n\n\n\nAnd I've tried to settle-In\n\nLove hurt as she goes\n\nBut there's really nothing gentle\n\nIn the touch upon her nose\n\n\n\nFare thee well\n\nTrue love of mine\n\nMay all your sweeter fruit\n\nCling forever\n\n\n\nThe road is hard to follow\n\nWhen you're done drifting through\n\nBut if you ever find the middle\n\nI'll be waiting when you do",
