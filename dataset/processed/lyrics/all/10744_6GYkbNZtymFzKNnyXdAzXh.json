  "lyrics": "I took a shot to the face so, you took a shot to the heart\r\nI thought that I needed space but, now I can't live with the lost\r\nYou move to a different place so, I wonder what's going on\r\nI text you 'bout once a month, conversations that turn to a song\r\nAnd it go, how you doing? How you been? How you feel?\r\nDo you ever, think of me, when you alone?\n\nHow you doing? How you been? How you feel?\n\nDo you got someone else, I don't wanna know\n\nAll that is all fall back 'cause I call you, you don't call back\n\nThen you call me I'm fucked up, my eyes low and my ball cap\n\nHad a good thing that we lost at, you came over I tossed that\n\nIt was all love, it was all trust, now is all back I gotta talk less\n\n\n\nShots going up, shots going up, then it's going down\n\nShots fired up, shots fired up, going not around\n\nShots going up, shots going up, then it's going down\n\nShots fired up, shots fired up, going on the ground\n\n\n\nI don't know if I'll make it through without a drink or two\n\nWhat you think? I don't know if I'll make it through\n\nUnless we break the rules, okay\n\nI don't care if you gotta dude\n\n'Cause he ain't' ride with you back in the day\n\nI don't care if I got a girl I know she not the one, let's go, stay\n\nI know that you just been chasin' memories, tryna rekindle the flame (rekindle the flame)\n\nYou know I been just erasin' all these memories, sippin' so I can ease the pain (so I can ease the pain)\n\nI know you out here experimentin', lookin' for attention 'cause I don't give you none\n\nI been actin' like I'm 21, gettin' drunk, havin' fun\n\nKnowin' I'ma get me some, but it goes like this one time, sing it to 'em\n\n\n\nShots going up, shots going up, then it's going down\n\nShots fired up, shots fired up, going not around\n\nShots going up, shots going up, then it's going down\n\nShots fired up, shots fired up, going not around\n\n\n\nShots going up, shots going up, then it's going down\n\nShots fired up, shots fired up, going not around\n\nShots going up, shots going up, then it's going down\n\nShots fired up, shots fired up, going not around",
