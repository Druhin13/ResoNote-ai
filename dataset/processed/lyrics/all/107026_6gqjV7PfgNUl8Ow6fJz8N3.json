  "lyrics": "Why do you look at me like that?\r\nYour eyes saying things that they can't take back\r\nFeels good, feels right, it don’t help\r\nEvery night when the quiet gets loud\r\nHate that I know what you're doin' right now\n\nYour arms around someone else\n\n\n\nEvery time I’m next to you\n\nI swear that you can feel it too\n\nHow long can we do this to ourselves?\n\n\n\nIn a different place and time\n\nMaybe in another life\n\nI'll bet that baby you and I would have worked\n\nWe never get the chance to try\n\nAnd what makes it worse\n\nIs you would have loved me\n\nIf you met me first\n\n\n\nI can't even count all the times I've thought\n\nAbout the line I'd never cross\n\nBut I've crossed that line in my head\n\n\n\nI can't steal you from somebody else\n\nJust to have you to myself\n\nMy heart don't wanna hear me tell the truth\n\n\n\nIn a different place and time\n\nMaybe in another life\n\nI’ll bet that baby you and I would have worked\n\nWe never get the chance to try\n\nAnd what makes it worse\n\nIs you would have loved me\n\nIf you met me first\n\n\n\nI’m not hangin' on to hope\n\nIf you do or if you don’t\n\nI don't ever wanna know for sure\n\n\n\nIn a different place and time\n\nMaybe in another life\n\nI'll bet that baby you and I would have worked\n\nWe never get the chance to try\n\nAnd what makes it worse\n\nIs you would have loved me\n\nIf you met me first\n\n\n\n'Cause you would have loved me\n\nIf you met me first\n\nOh, you would have loved me\n\nIf you met me first",
