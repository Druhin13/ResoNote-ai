(My nigga, where you going?)\n\nI just came off the road (off the road)\n\nLondon, Paris, Tokyo world tour\n\nI need a vacation!\n\nWhere you been? (My nigga, where you been?)\n\nAustralia to Kingston (blap blap)\n\nBut I still ain't make it to the motherland (Goddamn)\n\n\n\nPack your bags yourself\n\nFor your vacation in Hell\n\nDon't feel the same to me (don't feel the same to me)\n\nDon't need explaining to me (don't need explaining to me)\n\nKnow when I'm going OT (know when I'm going OT)\n\nI don't got time for no sleep (I don't got time for no sleep)\n\n\n\nStand for something, get wild for something, get high for suffering\n\nEven if you gotta die for something\n\nEvery day we lost searching for truth and can't balance the signs\n\nAnd can't side with the youth, can't side with the blind\n\nThey singing to me, on the line of scrimmage\n\nDog, I don't even get it, humble from beginning\n\nWhole season time we eatin', you know a nigga fiendin'\n\nWhen his weed is per diem (you must be European)\n\nSo whatever your vice is, don't make it tarnish the price list\n\nMy halo growing brightly, no rap shit entice me\n\nThe on and off light switch, bitch\n\nFocus on your own shit instead of being nosy\n\nAnd know, the rap Moses\n\nOrchestratin purpose partly cause I got focused\n\nSo is the cultural remarkable on the soul on to tour the globe\n\nWith his hands on a .44 but that ain't what I voted for\n\n\n\nBeing honest is like a superpower these days\n\nBeing yourself is like a superpower these days\n\nMoney and wealth is like a superpower these days\n\nFire pon yuh head top lead shower these days\n\nBeing honest is like a superpower these days\n\nBeing yourself is like a superpower these days\n\nMoney and wealth is like a superpower these days\n\nFire pon yuh head top lead shower these days\n\n\n\nCan't follow me, numero uno upon a galaxy, it's blasphemy\n\nThey talk about it, living all these fallacies\n\nI got that cavarly, don't make me split up your anatomy\n\nI get her sad or sappy cause they sabotage her artistry\n\nPardon me, you're boring me, my rhymes is like some sorcery\n\nGravity holdin me, gotta get my shit in order, B\n\nThere's more to me than what you see or choose to believe in\n\nThis world is backwards, we're still in shackles\n\nDesigned to be confused, they only use blacks\n\nWhen describing negative views only show blacks\n\nWhen they violent in their views\n\nIt's more than that, they replace the phones with they homes\n\nParents be gone, don't teach their kids right or wrong\n\nNot to be confused with this, this, or that one\n\nMy swag won, bad since this Michael Jackson\n\nAssassinated, all my heroes are in cages\n\nIt's modern slavin', no money or label could take 'em\n\nMy name out on the table, this dudes is fables\n\nI spread my wings so I can fly, just like an angel\n\nMy soul in sync with the universe and I'ma teach it\n\nLacking substance, I hope you seek it\n\nAll these followers but no one leading, it's so deceiving\n\nThis ain't about the land of freedom, the richest lead 'em\n\nGender equality? What about human equality?\n\nLoving is one, and the future's looking cloudy\n\nSo they poison the water, poison the mind, poison the heart\n\nTake all the land and rip it apart\n\nRacism's still alive, they just be concealing it\n\nShout out to Kane, and all my niggas in the bane\n\nAnd so it seems, gotta lead the youth to reach their dreams\n\nNo disrespect, it's like a generation disconnect\n\nLogging in, all I see is hate up on the internet\n\nWhere's the love? They're scared of love, I always gotta give it back\n\n\n\nI need a vacation!\n\nWhere you going? (My nigga, where you going?)\n\nI just came off the road (off the road)\n\nLondon, Paris, Tokyo world tour\n\nI need a vacation!\n\nWhere you been? (My nigga, where you been?)\n\nAustralia to Kingston (blap blap)\n\nBut I still ain't make it to the motherland (Goddamn)\n\n\n\nPack your bags yourself\n\nFor your vacation in Hell\n\nDon't feel the same to me (don't feel the same to me)\n\nDon't need explaining to me (don't need explaining to me)\n\nKnow when I'm going OT (know when I'm going OT)\n\nI don't got time for no sleep (I don't got time for no sleep)",
