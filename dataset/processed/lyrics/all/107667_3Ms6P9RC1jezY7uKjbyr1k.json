I guess I was a shoulder to cry on\n\n\n\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart\n\nA man under cover but you tore me apart, ooh-hoo\n\nNow I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again\n\n\n\nLast Christmas\n\nI gave you my heart\n\nBut the very next day you gave it away\n\nThis year\n\nTo save me from tears\n\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nLast Christmas\n\nI gave you my heart\n\nBut the very next day you gave it away\n\nThis year\n\nTo save me from tears\n\nI'll give it to someone special\n\n\n\nLast Christmas\n\nI gave you my heart\n\nBut the very next day you gave it away\n\nThis year\n\nTo save me from tears\n\nI'll give it to someone special\n\n\n\nA face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)\n\nA man under cover but you tore him apart\n\nMaybe next year I'll give it to someone\n\nI'll give it to someone special\n\nSpecial...\n\nSomeone...",
