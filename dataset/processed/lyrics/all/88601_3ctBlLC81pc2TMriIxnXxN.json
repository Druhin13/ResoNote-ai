  "lyrics": "Reverence so uncomfortable\r\nYou sit across the room\r\nCause I’m too scared to talk to you\r\nYou knew a friend I knew a friend\r\nI looked down at your hands\n\nPretending I was looking at the floor\n\n\n\nI held your eyes for quite sometime\n\nI’m not sure how it happened\n\nI was just surprised\n\nWere you surprised?\n\n\n\nI walk in the breeze\n\nLike I am seventeen\n\nLove is mostly war\n\nAnd war what is it for?\n\n\n\nOnly love the people\n\nWho don’t love you back\n\nWhat is up with that?\n\nAre you done with that?\n\n\n\nI can’t say I’m much different\n\nCause I still love you\n\nI was blinded\n\nAnd I’m still blinded\n\n\n\nI walk in the breeze\n\nLike I am seventeen\n\nLove is mostly war\n\nAnd love what is it for?\n\n\n\nI distract myself with other things\n\nTo keep myself from you\n\nI’m tired of the others\n\nThey never loved you\n\n\n\nMy life has always been a kind of secret\n\nCan you keep it?\n\nCould you keep it?\n\n\n\nI walk in the breeze\n\nLike I am seventeen\n\nLove is mostly war\n\nAnd love what is it for?\n\n\n\nYou always say that I look so tough\n\nBut it’s because I’m tough",
