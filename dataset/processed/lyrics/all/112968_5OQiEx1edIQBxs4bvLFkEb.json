  "lyrics": "I came to you,\r\nwhen I needed a rest\r\nYou took my love,\r\nand put it to the test\r\nI saw some things,\r\nthat I never\n\nwould have guessed\n\nFeel like a railroad,\n\nI pulled a whole load behind.\n\n\n\nThat old white line\n\nis friend of mine\n\nAnd it's good time\n\nwe've been making\n\nRight now I'm rollin' down\n\nthe open road\n\nAnd the daylight\n\nwill soon be breaking.\n\n\n\nI was adrift\n\non a river of pride\n\nIt seemed like such a\n\nlong easy ride\n\nYou were my raft\n\nbut I let you slide\n\nI've been down but\n\nI'm coming back up again.\n\n\n\nAnd I'm rollin' down\n\nthe open road\n\nWhere the daylight\n\nwill soon be breaking\n\nRight now I'm thinking 'bout\n\nthese things that I know\n\nBut it's good time\n\nthat we've been making.",
