  "lyrics": "Well, she was an American girl\r\nRaised on promises\r\nShe couldn't help thinkin'\r\nThat there was a little more to life somewhere else\r\nAfter all it was a great big world\r\nWith lots of places to run to\n\nAnd if she had to die tryin'\n\nShe had one little promise she was gonna keep\n\n\n\nO yeah, all right\n\nTake it easy, baby\n\nMake it last all night\n\nShe was an American girl\n\n\n\nWell it was kind of cold that night,\n\nShe stood alone on her balcony\n\nYeah, she could hear the cars roll by,\n\nOut on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach\n\nAnd for one desperate moment\n\nThere he crept back in her memory\n\nGod it's so painful when something that's so close\n\nIs still so far out of reach\n\n\n\nO yeah, all right\n\nTake it easy, baby\n\nMake it last all night\n\nShe was an American girl",
