  "lyrics": "I was awakened\r\nBy the sun peeking in through my blinds to say \"Hi\"\r\nLaying awake and thinking about everything you said to me last night\r\nUsually I wake up to your texts\r\nMaybe you just forgot today\r\nWasn't prepared for what you did next, no\n\nBaby believe me when I say\n\n\n\nI never felt that you lied through those big, brown eyes\n\nI didn't think that I'd found my heart-break designer by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nI never felt that you'd lead me here\n\nIt's so empty how can it be so easy just to forget me\n\nNo not you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\n\n\nWhere did you come from\n\nI thought that you was sent to me\n\nLike my angel, my stranger\n\nMaking me feel dumb\n\nI was ignoring everybody that told me that my heart was in danger\n\nMaybe I was just a number (Maybe I was just a number)\n\nMaybe I was just another (Maybe I was just another)\n\nOnly making me wonder\n\nMaybe I loved too hard that summer\n\n\n\nI never felt that you lied through those big, brown eyes\n\nI didn't think that I'd found my heart-break designer by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nI never felt that you'd lead me here\n\nIt's so empty how can it be so easy just to forget me\n\nNo not you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\n\n\nUsed to love having you closer\n\nNow I'm just looking for closure\n\nWish that I could sell you right now\n\nIs there no way to be found now\n\nYou left my heart on the ground now\n\nTell me how you live with yourself, don't\n\n\n\nI never felt that you lied through those big, brown eyes\n\nI didn't think that I'd found my heart-break designer by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nI never felt that you'd lead me here\n\nIt's so empty how can it be so easy just to forget me\n\nNo not you\n\nNo, no no, not by you\n\nNo, no no, not by you",
