  "lyrics": "Thought I'd wake up\r\nSomehow that weight would be off my chest\r\nLast night I said what I couldn't say before\r\nI thought we'd break up\r\nAnd it wouldn't take much for me to move on and\r\nFind someone I'm a whole lot better for\n\nNow I'm starting to think\n\nIt ain't that easy\n\n\n\nI hated to do what I had to do\n\nCause I was afraid of hurting you\n\nI thought I was good with goodbye\n\nBut my heart's having a hard time (hard time)\n\nMaking sense of how I'm doing what's right\n\nGot me so tore up inside\n\nYeah, I know I made up my mind\n\nBut my heart, my heart's having a hard time\n\n\n\nIt shouldn't be so tough for me\n\nTo change my lock screen, but it's sinking in that I don't get to kiss that smile no more\n\nWe had a million reasons\n\nSomeone had to do the leaving, but how I thought I'd feel ain't how I'm feeling\n\n\n\nI hated to do what I had to do\n\nCause I was afraid of hurting you\n\nI thought I was good with goodbye\n\nBut my heart's having a hard time\n\nMaking sense of how I'm doing what's right\n\nGot me so tore up inside\n\nYeah, I know I made up my mind\n\nBut my heart, my heart's having a hard time\n\n\n\nNow I'm missing you\n\nNow I'm wishing you\n\nAnd I had worked it out\n\nIf it was so wrong\n\nWhy am I still loving you now?\n\n\n\nI hated to do what I had to do\n\nCause I was afraid of hurting you\n\nI thought I was good with goodbye\n\nBut my heart's having a hard time\n\nMaking sense of how I'm doing what's right\n\nGot me so tore up inside\n\nYeah, I know I made up my mind\n\nBut my heart, my heart's having a hard time\n\n(My heart's having a hard time)",
