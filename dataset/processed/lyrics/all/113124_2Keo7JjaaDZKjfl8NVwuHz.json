  "lyrics": "I got your invitation so show me what you got\r\nAre you man enough?\r\nYou got me in a cold sweat with a lingering caress\r\nA bullet in your chamber with no return address\n\nIf you can keep a secret then we can make a deal\n\nPut your finger on your trigger and show me how you feel\n\n\n\nWhen you're moving to the music you got voodoo in your hips\n\nAnd the devil would approve it so the question on my lips\n\n\n\nAre you man enough?\n\nAre you man enough?\n\nAre you man enough?\n\nTo be mine\n\nTo be mine\n\nBe my girl\n\n\n\nYou got my full attention when you're movin' Â‘cross the floor\n\nDivine intervention comes a knockin' on my door\n\nI got no time for talking, just need some company\n\nLet your fingers do the walking all over me\n\n\n\nWhen you're moving to the music you got voodoo in your eyes\n\nLet the devil try to prove it but the question will arise\n\n\n\nAre you man enough?\n\nAre you man enough?\n\nAre you man enough?\n\nTo be mine\n\nTo be mine\n\nBe my girl\n\n\n\nShow me down the river [4x]\n\n\n\nAre you man enough? [6x]\n\n\n\nAre you man enough to be my girl?\n\nAre you man enough? (Are you man enough?)\n\nAre you man enough? (Are you man enough?)\n\nAre you man enough? (Are you man enough?)\n\nTo be mine\n\nTo be mine\n\nBe my girl",
