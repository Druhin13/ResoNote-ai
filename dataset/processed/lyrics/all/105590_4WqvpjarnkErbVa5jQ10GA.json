  "lyrics": "Your heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\r\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\r\nLonely for me\r\nI quit chillin' with the hombres\r\nTo lay in bed and make you sing like Beyonc√©\n\nThem other brothers must be doing it the wrong way\n\nCause you said you love it when I put it in the long way\n\nAye, I be the king of all your fetishes\n\nNo doubt, late night text messages\n\nHeart grows fonder, legs grow restless\n\nIf love is a sickness, then I am the specialist\n\n\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\n\n\nIn the mothership, putting in the long days\n\nLava flows, then we ghost down to Pompeii\n\nWe can blow down the coast, that's the ganja\n\nNo clothes, sweat glows, dirty laundry\n\nAye, hot wax when the candle's lit\n\nSafe words, legs burns, can you handle it?\n\nTrash the room, phone rings, never answer it\n\nIf love's like a war, then I'm not the pacifist\n\n\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\n\n\nTell me what you waiting for?\n\n(You are the one calling for me)\n\nTell me can you take some more?\n\n(You are the one lost and lonely)\n\nLeave it on the bedroom floor\n\n(You are the one calling for me)\n\nI cannot wait for this\n\nCause I'm right back to your love\n\nSo I can get some more\n\n\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is, your heart is lonely for me\n\nYour heart is, your heart is...",
