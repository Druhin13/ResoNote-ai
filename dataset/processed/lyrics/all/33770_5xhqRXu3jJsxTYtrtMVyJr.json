  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson First Kiss par Marcus & Martinus\r\nI was thinking about how you look\nWith the moon lighting up your eyes\nYou’re in my head and my heart and I know it's right\nI got your hand in my hand and I’m digging this thing, digging this thing when you’re looking like bling\nNever let go, Imma do what I know is right\n\nAnd if could feel your lips tonight\nI think I wanna do this every night\n\nYou are my first kiss\nNever knew it could feel like this\nI think I'm in love\n\n\nYou are my first kiss\nNever knew it could feel like this\nI think I'm in love\n\nYou are my first, first, first kiss\nNever knew it could feel, feel, feel like this\n\nI don't know if you know\nWhen my friends may have said I’m a fool for you\nAnd I'm feeling that fizz so hard like I always do\nI know I'm saying, but I must say I’m digging this thing, digging this thing when you’re looking like bling\nNever let go, imma do what I know is right\n\nAnd if could feel your lips tonight\n\nI think wanna do this every night\n\nYou are my first kiss\nNever knew it could feel like this\nI think I'm in love\n\nYou are my first kiss\nNever knew it could feel like this\nI think I'm in love\n\nYou are my first, first, first kiss\nNever knew it could feel, feel, feel like this\n\nBeen dreaming of you for so long\nSo I really had you to write you this song\nAnd I've been known to put my worst right out\nBut you make me go silent now\nWhat can I say?\n\n\nYou are my first (you are my first) kiss\nNever knew it could feel like this\nI think I'm in love\n\nYou are my first (first) kiss (kiss)\nNever knew it could feel like this (feel like this)\nI think I'm in love\n\nYou are my first, first, first kiss\nNever knew it could feel, feel, feel like this\n\nYou are my first, (you are my first) first, first k​iss\nNever knew it could feel, feel, feel like this",
