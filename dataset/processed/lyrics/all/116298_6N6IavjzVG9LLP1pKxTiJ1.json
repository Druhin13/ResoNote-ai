  "lyrics": "When you left the other night, I didn't think I'd see you again\r\nIt was a hell of a fight, it felt like it was the end\r\nYou broke down, we broke up, we were sayin' it was over\r\nHere I am now, with your head on my shoulder\r\nIf tellin' each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss\n\nIf you tearin' out my drive is gonna get us makin' love like this\n\n'Cause it's crazy to think that yesterday we weren't even talkin'\n\nIf this is how it's gonna be, then baby maybe we should break up more often\n\n\n\nYou left the charger by the bed, and that jacket that you always wore\n\nSo I shot you that text, said they're sittin' outside on the porch\n\nBut last night you showed up, I saw you standin' there at my door\n\nNow that dress you hd on is layin' on my floor\n\n\n\nIf tellin' each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss\n\nIf you tearin' out my drive is gonna get us makin' love like this\n\n'Cause it's crazy to think that yesterday we weren't even talkin'\n\nIf this is how it's gonna be, then baby maybe we should break up more often\n\n\n\nAnd I don't even know what the fight was even over\n\nBut look us now, girl we've never been closer\n\n\n\nIf tellin' each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss\n\nIf you tearin' out my drive is gonna get us makin' love like this\n\n'Cause it's crazy to think that yesterday we weren't even talkin'\n\nIf this is how it's gonna be, then baby maybe we should break up more often\n\n\n\nLet's break up more often",
