  "lyrics": "Do you remember the last time I said\r\nIf I ever thought about lying,\r\nI'd rather think of dying instead\r\nAnd maybe you remember the last time you called me\r\nto say we were through\r\nHow it took a million tears\n\njust to prove they all were for you\n\nBut those days are through\n\n\n\n'Cause it wouldn't have made any difference,\n\nif you loved me\n\nHow could you love me\n\nWhen it wouldn't really make any difference,\n\nif you really loved me\n\nYou just didn't love me\n\n\n\n'Cause I know of hundreds of times I could be\n\nIn the most unfaithful arms that you always picture me\n\nAnd maybe you remember that\n\nthough I can't always show proof I was true\n\nNo one else could change my mind or\n\nstop me coming home to you\n\nBut those days are through\n\n\n\nYou just did not love me enough to believe me\n\nEnough not to leave me\n\nEnough not to look for a reason to be unhappy with me\n\nAnd make me regret ever wanting you\n\nBut those days are through",
