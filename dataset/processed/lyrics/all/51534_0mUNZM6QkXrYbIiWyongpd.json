  "lyrics": "My baby got eyes that’ll make your Christ unable to see\r\nMy baby gotta walk that’ll make the devil drop to his knees\r\nMy baby make you’ll put your phone down\r\nLay you out, lick you down, make you scream out\r\nOh god baby!! Have mercy on me\r\nYou break me down but you still got all that I need\n\n\n\nI’ll take every little sting of your claws baby\n\nI’d tear out my heart for you, I’d tear out my heart for you\n\nWe’re not perfect but we’re deadly in love baby\n\nI’d tear out my heart for you, I’d tear out my heart for you\n\n\n\nI’ve been drowning in your ever flowing mind\n\nYou’ve been suffering from an endless broken heart\n\nI’ve been singing to reclaim my sanity\n\nWe’ve been sinnin but together we’ll be free\n\n(They warned us)\n\nDon’t you ever fall for the type\n\nTo bring your worst demons out at night\n\nBut we don’t care we’ll put up a fight\n\nTo keep on being together now\n\n\n\nI’ll take every little sting of your claws baby\n\nI’d tear out my heart for you, I’d tear out my heart for you\n\nWe’re not perfect but we’re deadly in love baby\n\nI’d tear out my heart for you, I’d tear out my heart for you\n\nI’ll take every little sting of your claws baby\n\nI’d tear out my heart for you, I’d tear out my heart for you\n\nWe’re not perfect but we’re deadly in love baby\n\nI’d tear out my heart for you, I’d tear out my heart for you",
