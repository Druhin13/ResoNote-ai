  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Boy Toy par Marisa Maino\r\nYou've known some girls who couldn't pull the gun\nYour bed is warm but I love a good storm\nThere's been some boys that I've made very sad\nYour love is tasteful but taste can go bad\n\nOut with old, in with the new\nThat's the way that this world works\nWhen I'm with you all my senses go blue\nAnd I can't help but fight it\n\nI've got lots of boy toys\nAnd if you can't play nice\nYou'll go back where you've been\nI know that you think you got me locked down\nYou're the only good thing I've got in this town\nBut I've got lots of boy toys\n\nLot's of boy toys\n\nWalking 'round angry 'bout things I've done wrong\nTelling me I don't know how to sing songs\nYou're just a tired old sad little man\nYes, I'm a big girl, don't need holding hands\n\nOut with old, in with the new\nThat's the way that this world works\nWhen I'm with you all my senses go blue\nAnd I can't help but fight it\n\nI've got lots of boy toys\nAnd if you can't play nice\nYou'll go back where you've been\nI know that you think you got me locked down\nYou're the only good thing I've got in this town\nBut I've got lots of boy toys\n\nLot's of boy toys\nLot's of boy toys\n\nLot's of boy toys\nLot's of\nLot's of boy toys\nLot's of\n\nI've got lots of boy toys\nAnd if you can't play nice\nYou'll go back where you've been\nI know that you think you got me locked down\nYou're the only good thing I've got in this town\nBut I've got lots of boy toys\nLot's of boy toys",
