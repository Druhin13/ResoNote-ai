  "lyrics": "Been searching for the one who wants to make you something better than you could\r\nOr maybe one who wants to turn you into something that you should\r\nThough it's easily assumed you'll be taking\r\nIt's even easier to know you'll be waiting\r\nAnd like a water, those tears come from eyes\n\nAnd well you oughta know when your well is running dry\n\n\n\nSo ain't no way, and I know, know\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nAnd no way [?]\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nAnd I know, know\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nBut no way [?]\n\n\n\nI'm saying don't stop now, keep moving\n\nDon't wanna be the one who's losing\n\nWell if you think that I'm confusing\n\nWhat it is that we've been doing\n\n\n\nI see no warning, give me something better [?] nothing\n\n[?] nothing but we better make it something\n\n[?] what you want\n\nBut all I wanna say is what you wanna hear\n\n\n\nAll around me, seen this world\n\nEvery day to different terms\n\nAll we do is stop and pray\n\nBut while I bring us back again\n\n\n\nOh I know, know\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nAnd no way [?]\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nAnd I know, know\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nBut no way [?]\n\n\n\nAin't no way, I know, know\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nAnd no way [?]\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nAnd I know, know\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nBut no way [?]\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nNo one gonna stop us now\n\nBut no way [?]\n\nNo one gonna stop us now",
