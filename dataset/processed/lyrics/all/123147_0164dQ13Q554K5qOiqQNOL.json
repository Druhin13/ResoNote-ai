  "lyrics": "Do you wonder if I ever spend my nights\r\nChasin' 'round through those city lights\r\nThe answer's no, I found out long ago\r\nI'll keep on loving you, I'll keep on loving you\r\nAnd I wonder if you've ever close your eyes\n\nAnd think of me sometimes late at night\n\nEven though the answer's probably no\n\nI'll keep on loving you, I'll keep on loving you\n\n\n\nI'll still call you baby\n\nI'll always treat you like a lady\n\nYou'll always remain to be somewhere in my soul\n\nAnd baby, shine brighter than any star\n\nThat's bringing on the evening\n\nBurning in my heart\n\n\n\nI'll still call you baby\n\nI'll always treat you like a lady\n\nGirl, you'll always remain to be somewhere in my soul\n\nAnd baby, shine brighter than any star\n\nThat's bringing on the evening\n\nBurning in my heart\n\n\n\nYeah, I'll still call you baby\n\nForever in my heart",
