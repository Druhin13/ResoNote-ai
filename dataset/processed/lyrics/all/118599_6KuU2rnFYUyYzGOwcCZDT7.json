  "lyrics": "Don't take yourself so seriously\r\nLook at you all dressed up for someone you never see\r\nYou're here for a reason but you don't know why\r\nYou're split and uneven your hands to the sky\r\nSurrender yourself\n\nAnd I wonder why I tear myself down\n\nTo be built back up again\n\nOh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again\n\nAll that's left of myself\n\nHoles in my false confidence\n\nAnd now I lay myself down\n\nAnd hope I wake up young again\n\nHope I wake up young again\n\n\n\nDon't let those demons in again\n\nI fill the void up with polished doubt, fake sentiment\n\nSurrender yourself\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder why I tear myself down\n\nTo be built back up again\n\nOh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again\n\nAll that's left of myself\n\nHoles in my false confidence\n\nAnd now I lay myself down\n\nAnd hope I wake up young again\n\nHope I wake up young again\n\nHope I wake up young again\n\n\n\nWhy won't you take me seriously\n\nLook at me all fucked up over someone I'll never meet\n\n\n\nAnd I wonder why I tear myself down\n\nTo be built back up again\n\nOh I hope somehow, I'll wake up young again\n\nAll that's left of myself\n\nHoles in my false confidence\n\nAnd now I lay myself down\n\nAnd hope I wake\n\n\n\nI wonder why I tear myself down\n\nTo be built back up again\n\nOh I hope some how I wake up young again\n\nAll that's left of myself\n\nHoles in my false confidence\n\nAnd now I lay myself down\n\nAnd hope I wake up young again\n\nHope I wake up young again\n\nHope I wake up young again",
