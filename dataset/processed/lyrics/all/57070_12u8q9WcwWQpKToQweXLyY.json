  "lyrics": "I wonder if depression ever ends\r\nOr if it will end me\r\nI'm still dancing on the edge of the blade\r\n'Til it cuts me in half\r\nSome days I feel everything at once\r\nOther days I feel nothing at all\n\nSo what's worse?\n\nDrowning beneath the waves or dying from the thirst?\n\n\n\nI dropped my Prozac from one day to the other\n\nI do not regret, why should I bother?\n\nI just wonder what will happen?!\n\nMaybe it will kill me... eventually set me free...\n\n\n\nNeither do I ask the night to explain\n\nI wait for it and it envelops me\n\nAnd so you, me, gloom and light...\n\nAnd shadows... are\n\n\n\nDon't charm away my melancholy, it's everything I've got\n\nTo me it's kind of death, but I'm forced to keep living\n\nI won't glorify or romanticize what you call heartbreak\n\nBut nothing in this world was promised or belong to you\n\n\n\nSomeday someone won't be afraid of the lows I drag\n\nThey won't stay on the shore, they'll meet me in the depths\n\n\n\nI am not dead but also not alive\n\nI seem like a ghost with a beating heart\n\n'Cause death is not the greatest loss in life\n\nBut what dies inside us while we fledge\n\n\n\nWe are walking away quietly into empty spaces\n\nWe are trying to close the gaps of the past\n\n'Cause of all sad words of tongue or pen\n\nThe saddest are these: 'It might have been'\n\n\n\nDon't charm away my melancholy, it's everything I've got\n\nTo me it's kind of death, but I'm forced to keep living\n\nI won't glorify or romanticize what you call heartbreak\n\nBut nothing in this world was promised or belonged to you...\n\nWas promised or belonged to you",
