  "lyrics": "Well every morning I wake up\r\nIt's the same old routine\r\nI curse the alarm clock\r\nThat takes you from my dreams\r\nAnd it's so hard to get out of bed\r\nWhen you don't wanna move\n\nNow, I miss you\n\n\n\nI miss your hair on the pillow\n\nPerfume in the air\n\nI miss coming home from work\n\nTo your shoes everywhere\n\nEveryday\n\nIt's the same damn thing\n\nFeeling so lonesome and blue\n\nWell, I miss you\n\n\n\nI could cry out to Jesus\n\nAnd I could curse his name\n\nI could sell this old house\n\nAnd box up all your things\n\nI could find me a woman\n\nAnd feel something\n\nWith somebody new\n\nBut I miss you\n\n\n\nI miss your hair on the pillow\n\nPerfume in the air\n\nI miss coming home from work\n\nTo your shoes everywhere\n\nEveryday\n\nIt's the same damn thing\n\nFeeling so lonesome and blue\n\nWell, I miss you\n\n\n\nEveryday\n\nIt's the same damn thing\n\nFeeling so lonesome and blue\n\nWell, I miss you\n\nWell, I miss youâ€‹\n\nWell, I miss you",
