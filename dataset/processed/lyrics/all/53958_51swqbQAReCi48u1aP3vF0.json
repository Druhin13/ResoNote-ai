  "lyrics": "[Verse 1:]\r\nTime will bring the real end of our trial\r\nOne day they'll be no remnants\r\nNo trace, no residual feelings within ya\r\nOne day you won't remember me\n\nYour face will be the reason I smile\n\nBut I will not see what I cannot have forever\n\nI'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same\n\n\n\n[Hook:]\n\nOh you played me dirty, your game was so bad\n\nYou toyed with my affliction\n\nHad to fill out my prescription\n\nFound the remedy, I had to set you free\n\n\n\nAway from me\n\nTo see clearly the way that love can be\n\nWhen you are not with me\n\nI had to leave, I have to live\n\nI had to lead, I had to live\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nIf I can't have you, let love set you free\n\nTo fly your pretty wings around\n\nPretty wings, your pretty wings\n\nYour pretty wings around\n\n\n\n[Verse 2:]\n\nI came wrong you were right\n\ntransformed your love into light\n\nbaby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies\n\n\n\nI turned day into night\n\nsleep late like I died a thousand times\n\nI shoulda showed you\n\nBetter night better times better days\n\nI miss you more, more\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nIf I can't have you, let love set you free\n\nTo fly your pretty wings around\n\nPretty wings, your pretty wings\n\nYour pretty wings around",
