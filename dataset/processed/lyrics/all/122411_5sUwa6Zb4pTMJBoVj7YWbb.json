  "lyrics": "Darlin, darlin\r\nMy how the time flew\r\nWe were so poor and lost back then\r\nBut we made it through\r\nI got the groceries and you paid the electric\r\nJust enough to make due\n\nThings were never easy but we were strong together\n\nCuz one and one made 2\n\n\n\nSo I’ll drive all night til the wheels fall off\n\nJust to get to you\n\nI’ll keep you warm when it’s cold outside\n\nWon’t have to ask me to\n\nI’ll pull you close when it’s hectic and you’re feeling disconnected\n\nI’ll be there for you\n\nGive every beat til my heart runs out\n\nCuz they’re all for you\n\n\n\nAll for you\n\nAll for you\n\n\n\nDarlin, darlin\n\nAll that you gave to me\n\nKnew right away I was falling\n\nAnd you were so carefree\n\nWe wrote our names and we put them in a bottle\n\nSent it out to sea\n\nAt the end of the night we went in different directions\n\nBut it was destiny",
