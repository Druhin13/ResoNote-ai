  "lyrics": "She's the edge between the sacred and profane\r\nAnd means at least one other language you would never speak in Polite Company\r\nShe's a dancer, lone riddle in the answer\r\nShe auditioned for Romantics\r\nBut no calls from the right company\n\nShe'll never love the way you need her to, darlin'\n\nYou'll never lift her at all\n\nShe only wants the man she thinks is you, darlin'\n\nYou'll only take her if you think you could lose\n\nSo what if I don't find you, take you back?\n\nI only want what I can't have\n\nIf you love me, give me nothing\n\nBut\n\nPolite Company\n\n\n\nWe're the dance among the drunklegs, a contest between\n\nUntied lace, pop-shoegaze, and 808 Heartbreak\n\nWe both caught the pace of two hearts, offbeat\n\n\n\nWhat will hold you when the dance is through?\n\nPut your back against the wall\n\nFollow syncopated water fountain conversation\n\nMaking love inside a crayon covered bathroom stall\n\nWhat if I don't find you, take you there?\n\nI only want what I can't have\n\nIf you love me, give me nothing\n\nNothing\n\n\n\nSome simple math\n\nTwo I can add\n\nI ain't writing it down\n\nI remember now what you came for, where your aim is\n\nMaintain it\n\nTry to burn the right glow\n\nI'll be on my way out\n\nI'll be over soon\n\nSober later\n\nFire that only I'd know\n\nYou've been on my Radar\n\nAre you lonely too?\n\n'Cause your coast is clear to get a hold on me\n\n\n\nShe's the edge between the cadence of my name\n\nAnd on these walls another language we would never speak\n\nIn Polite Company",
