  "lyrics": "I wish you peace \nWhen the cold winds blow \nWarmed by the fire's glow. \nI wish you comfort \nIn the lonely times \nAnd arms to hold you \n\nWhen you ache inside. \n\nI wish you hope \n\nWhen things are going bad, \n\nAnd kind words when times are sad. \n\nI wish you shelter from the raging wind. \n\nAnd coolin' waters at the fever's end. \n\nI wish you peace when times are hard, \n\nThe light to guide you through the dark. \n\nAnd when storms are high \n\nAnd your dreams are low, \n\nI wish you the strength to let love grow on, \n\nI wish you the strength to to let love flow. \n\nI wish you peace when times when times are hard, \n\nThe light to guide you through the dark. \n\nAnd when storms are high and your dreams are low \n\nI wish you the strength to let love grow on, \n\nI wish you the strength to let love flow, \n\nI wish you the strength to let love grow-on, \n\nI wish you the strength to let love grow on",
