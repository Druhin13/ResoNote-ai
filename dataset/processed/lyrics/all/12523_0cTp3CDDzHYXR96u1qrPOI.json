  "lyrics": "You're headin' for a fadin' horizon\r\nMiles ahead\r\nYou're running like a child to the water\r\nToo close to the edge\r\nYou're looking for something more\r\nIt's hard to accept\r\nThat I found my home\r\nBut you haven't found yours yet\r\nYou go, you go lonely\r\nTake another piece of my life\r\nYou go, you go lonely\r\nI taught you how to run and you left my side\r\nAnd yeah\r\nI've been lying if I said I'm fine\r\nI break, just a little\r\nI know you need this but I'm dying inside\r\nI'm saving you a place 'til you come back\r\nHolding on for more than an empty home\r\nI'm saving you a place 'til you come back\r\nHolding on for more than the bittersweet\r\nBittersweet yeah\r\n♪\r\nI'm treading on a fine line of worry\r\nAnd I'm torn between\r\nHolding you back or letting you leave\r\nYou go, you go lonely\r\nTake another piece of my life\r\nYou go, you go lonely\r\nI taught you how to run and you left my side\r\nAnd yeah\r\nI've been lying if I said I'm fine\r\nI break, just a little\r\nI know you need this but I'm dying inside\r\nI'm saving you a place 'til you come back\r\nHolding on for more than an empty home\r\nI'm saving you a place 'til you come back\r\nHolding on for more than the bittersweet\r\n♪\r\nYou go, you go lonely\r\nTake another piece of my life\r\nI'm saving you a place 'til you come back\r\nHolding on for more than an empty home\r\nI'm saving you a place 'til you come back\r\nHolding on for more than the bittersweet\r\nBittersweet yeah",
