  "lyrics": "I'll make you sorry\r\nI'll make you sorry\r\nAm I losing faith in my own anger?\r\nI forgot to punch max out on my own\r\nYou drive my sin, this blue bullet hit me hard\n\nWhen stimuli stays, I can't feel you, you're too far\n\n\n\nTalk to me in whispers with bad intention\n\nSo many of us lie but you're not the worst\n\nYou drive my sin, this blue bullet hit me hard\n\nSweet to the taste, I can't feel you, you're too far\n\n\n\nI once was in love before I knew you\n\nBut I've given up\n\nI once was in love before you\n\n\n\nSpell my name with sand and suck up the salt air\n\nDug deep beyond our world, a vision of hope\n\nYou drive my sin, bounce like glass against a flame\n\nWhere future structures fail, their ruins write your name\n\n\n\nI once was in love before I knew you\n\nBut I've given up\n\nI once was in love before you\n\n\n\nI once was in love before I knew you\n\nBut I've given up\n\nI once was in love before you\n\n\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\n\n\nI once was in love before I knew you\n\nBut I've given up\n\nI once was in love before you\n\n\n\nI once was in love before I knew you\n\nBut I've given up\n\nI once was in love before you\n\n\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\nI'll make you sorry\n\nI'll make you sorry",
