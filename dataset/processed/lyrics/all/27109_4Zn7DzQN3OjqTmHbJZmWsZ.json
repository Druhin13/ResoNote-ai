  "lyrics": "There's a cherry on top tonight\r\nFor men who look like jesus tonight\r\nIf you play your cards right\r\nYou can be the the son of god tonight\r\nYou were thin you were undersized for the spring\n\nYou entered your name just as “tight blue jeans”\n\nIn my phone I guess you do this kind of thing\n\nAhh yeah\n\n\n\nWell we met on the floor\n\nCCR was playing\n\n“long as i can see the light”\n\nThey were singing\n\nYou gave me the look\n\nThat said “lets be animals tonight”\n\n”right away we were synthesized\"\n\n\n\nSo we took off\n\nDown sunset boulevard\n\nThe back tires were spinning\n\nThe axles they were teething us into beyond\n\nWay out on that boulevard\n\nWe can be weightless, timeless\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight you are heavy on my mind\n\nI watched you\n\nDrift behind my eyes\n\nI try to roll with the punches I flow with the tide\n\n\n\nGuess i thought you’d be forever\n\nYou’re now with me never\n\nMoments of heaven\n\nFrozen in a van with you girl\n\nI miss the lightness of laughter with you\n\n\n\nSo I tear out to sunset blvd\n\nYeah my back tires\n\nThey are spinning\n\nThe axles they are teething me\n\nInto beyond\n\nWay out on that blvd\n\nI can be weightless\n\nI can be timeless…\n\n\n\nSo far down sunset blvd\n\nYeah my back tires are spinning\n\nMy axles they are teething me\n\nInto beyond\n\nWay out on that blvd\n\nWay out on that blvd\n\nWay out on that precious blvd\n\nWe can be weightless\n\nTimeless…",
