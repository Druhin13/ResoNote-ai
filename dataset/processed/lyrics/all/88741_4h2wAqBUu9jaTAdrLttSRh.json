  "lyrics": "I took a walk around the world\r\nTo ease my troubled mind \nI left my body laying somewhere \nIn the sands of time \nI watched the world float \nTo the dark side of the moon \n\nI feel there is nothing I can do, yeah \n\nI watched the world float \n\nTo the dark side of the moon\n\nAfter all I knew it had to be \n\nSomething to do with you \n\nI really don't mind what happens now and then \n\nAs long as you'll be my friend at the end \n\nIf I go crazy then will you still \n\nCall me Superman\n\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be \n\nThere holding my hand \n\nI'll keep you by my side \n\nWith my superhuman might Kryptonite \n\nYou called me strong, you called me weak,\n\nBut still your secrets I will keep \n\nYou took for granted all the times \n\nI never let you down \n\nYou stumbled in and bumped your head, \n\nIf not for me then you would be dead\n\nI picked you up and put you back \n\nOn solid ground\n\nIf I go crazy then will you still \n\nCall me Superman\n\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be there \n\nHolding my hand \n\nI'll keep you by my side \n\nWith my superhuman might Kryptonite\n\nIf I go crazy then will you still\n\nCall me Superman\n\nIf I'm alive and well, \n\nWill you be there holding my hand \n\nI'll keep you by my side \n\nWith my superhuman might Kryptonite Yeah!! \n\nIf I go crazy then will you still \n\nCall me Superman\n\nIf I'm alive and well, will you be there \n\nHolding my hand \n\nI'll keep you by my side \n\nWith my superhuman might Kryptonite",
