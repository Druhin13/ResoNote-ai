  "lyrics": "Spring was never waiting for us dear\r\nIt ran one step ahead\r\nAs we followed in the dance\r\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\r\nAll the sweet, green icing flowing down\n\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\n\nI don't think that I can take it\n\n'cause it took so long to bake it\n\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again\n\nOh, nooooo\n\n\n\nI recall the yellow cotton dress\n\nFoaming like a wave\n\nOn the ground beneath your knees\n\nThe birds like tender babies in your hands\n\nAnd the old men playing chinese checkers by the trees\n\n\n\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\n\nAll the sweet green icing flowing down\n\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\n\nI don't think that I can take it\n\n'Cause it took so long to bake it\n\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again\n\nOh, nooooo\n\n\n\n\n\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\n\nAll the sweet green icing flowing down\n\nSomeone left my cake out in the rain\n\nI don't think that I can take it\n\n'Cause it took so long to make it\n\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again\n\nOh, nooooo",
