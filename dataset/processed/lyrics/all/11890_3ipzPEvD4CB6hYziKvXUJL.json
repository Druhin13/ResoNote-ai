  "lyrics": "Every time that I smoke cigarettes\r\nThe taste of the smoke rolling off my lips\r\nReminds me of how you beg me to quit\r\nAnd I still haven't quit\r\nEvery time that I order my coffee black\r\nYour memory keeps coming back\n\nIn a double tall Breve latte, two pumps classic\n\n\n\nI think about you all damn night\n\nI think about you all damn day\n\nI think about you driving around in the same little town\n\nAnd going on without me baby\n\nI wonder if you're happy now\n\nIf you're ever gonna be\n\nI think about you all the time, all the time, all the time\n\nDo you think about me? Do you think about me?\n\n\n\nI've been living my life on the frustrated side\n\nCause I can't hear your name without wanting to cry\n\nBut, can we just go back in time when you were holding me?\n\nI've been doing my best just to shake it off\n\nBut you keep weaving in and out of my thoughts\n\nYou should go, so just get lost and leave me be\n\n\n\nCause I think about you all damn night\n\nI think about you all damn day\n\nI think about you driving around in the same little town\n\nAnd going on without me baby\n\nI wonder if you're happy now\n\nIf you're ever gonna be\n\nI think about you all the time, all the time, all the time\n\nDo you think about me? Do you think about me?\n\n\n\nI think about you all damn night\n\nAll damn day\n\nDriving around in the same little town\n\nGoing on without me baby\n\nI wonder if you're happy now\n\nIf you're ever gonna be\n\nI think about you all the time, all the time, all the time\n\nDo you think about me? Do you think about me?\n\nAll the time, all the time, all the time, yeah",
