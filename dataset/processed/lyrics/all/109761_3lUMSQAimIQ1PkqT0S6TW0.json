My daddy told me\n\n\"Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.\"\n\nOnce I was eleven years old\n\n\n\nI always had that dream like my daddy before me\n\nSo I started writing songs, I started writing stories\n\nSomething about that glory\n\nJust always seemed to bore me\n\n'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me\n\n\n\nOnce I was twenty years old.\n\nMy story got told\n\nBefore the morning sun, when life was lonely\n\nOnce I was twenty years old\n\n\n\nSoon we'll be thirty years old\n\n\n\nOur songs have been sold\n\nWe've traveled around the world and we're still roaming\n\nSoon we'll be thirty years old\n\n\n\nSoon I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one\n\n\n\nRemember life and then your life becomes a better one\n\nI made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once\n\nI hope my children come and visit once or twice a month\n\nSoon I'll be sixty years old\n\nWill I think the world is cold\n\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me?\n\nSoon I'll be sixty years old\n\nSoon I'll be sixty years old\n\nWill I think the world is cold\n\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me?\n\nSoon I'll be sixty years old\n\nOnce I was seven years old, my mama told me\n\n\"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely.\"\n\nOnce I was seven years old\n\nOnce I was seven years old",
