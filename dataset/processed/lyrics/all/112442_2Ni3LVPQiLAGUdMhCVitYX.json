  "lyrics": "I can feel when my mind starts to creep and to doubt\r\nOn the days when the strength in my heart's giving out\r\nThere's a light but it hides from me deep in the cloud\r\nThere's a voice that I need but I don't hear a sound\r\nEver running to what I can't see\n\nFighting out of all my unbelief\n\nFather, even in my song will be\n\nI know You will always carry me\n\n\n\nIt's inevitable\n\n\n\nSet Your promise to play on repeat in my head\n\nWhen You meet my anxiety, put it to death\n\n\n\nEver running to what I can't see\n\nFighting out of all my unbelief\n\nFather, even in my song will be\n\nI know You will always carry me\n\n\n\nIt's inevitable\n\nIt's inevitable\n\nIt's inevitable\n\nIt's inevitable",
