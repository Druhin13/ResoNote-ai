  "lyrics": "My heart beats loud enough to deafen me\r\nAnd you keep coming to me in my dreams\r\nAnd lights flash, I beg that you'll appear\r\nIn flesh and tell me everything I want to hear\r\nAnd then again\n\nIf the pain is ENDLESS\n\nHow can I live?\n\nWhen the weight is RELENTLESS\n\nTo be with you now\n\nFeels like the only way out\n\n\n\nMAYBE you can make it better\n\nI don't need forever\n\nJust find me somehow\n\nAnd if you're unsure, coz we're been\n\nHere before\n\nI don't want more than for\n\nYou to talk me down\n\nAnd love me just for now\n\n\n\nMy mind plays with you like you're it's favourite game\n\nAnd I shake, addicted to the drug I crave\n\nAnd I'm trapped, carrying this burden on my back\n\nBut I won't let you fall even if my body cracks\n\nI don't need my body\n\n\n\nIf the pain is ENDLESS\n\nHow can I live?\n\nWhen the weight is RELENTLESS\n\nTo be with you now\n\nFeels like the only way out\n\n\n\nMAYBE you can make it better\n\nI don't need forever\n\nJust find me somehow\n\nAnd if you're unsure, coz we're been\n\nHere before\n\nI don't want more than for\n\nYou to talk me down\n\nAnd love me just for now\n\n\n\nI can't erase what we had\n\nSo please understand\n\nIt's not how I want this to be\n\nYet, I'm chained to the past\n\nAnd I'm sinking fast\n\n(It's) not how I wanted you to see me\n\n\n\nIf the pain is ENDLESS\n\nHow can I live?\n\nWhen the weight is RELENTLESS\n\nTo be with you now\n\nFeels like the only way out\n\n\n\nMAYBE you can make it better\n\nI don't need forever\n\nJust find me somehow\n\nAnd if you're unsure, coz we're been\n\nHere before\n\nI don't want more than for\n\nYou to talk me down\n\nAnd love me just for now",
