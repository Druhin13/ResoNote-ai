  "lyrics": "Penniless and tired, with your hair grown long\r\nI was looking at you there and your face looked wrong\r\nMemory is a fickle siren song\r\nI didn't understand\r\nIn the gentle light as the morning nears\n\nYou don't say a single word of your last two years\n\nWell you will be, you've reached the frontier\n\nI didn't understand, no\n\n\n\nSee your rugged hands and a silver knife\n\nTwenty dollars in your hand makes you hold so tight\n\nAll the evidence of your vacant life\n\nMy brother you were born\n\n\n\nAnd you will try to do what you did before\n\nPull the wool over your eyes\n\nFor a week or more\n\nLet your family take you back to your original mind\n\n\n\nThere's nothing I can do\n\nThere's nothing I can do\n\nThere's nothing I can say\n\nThere's nothing I can say\n\nI can say",
