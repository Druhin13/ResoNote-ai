  "lyrics": "Ain't I got a fortune buried so deep\r\nIn a lifetime of memories and the love I keep\r\nTurnin' within me while the sake of my name\r\nPours forth the only fortune I've gained\r\nAnd calls me on into the sun\n\nOnward into the sun\n\n\n\nJust a bird with a broken wing longing to fly\n\nThey've stretched every highway this poor boy could drive\n\nAt home with the grounded I found a way\n\nâ€˜Cross the plains and north mountains back again\n\n\n\nOnward into the sun\n\n\n\n\n\nAin't I got a fortune in nearing my end\n\nWhen I think of my family and all of my friends\n\nBut the highway is empty, my keys handed in\n\nI've mend in my broken wing, my soul it begins\n\n\n\nTo call me on into the sun\n\nOnward into the sun\n\nOnward into the sun\n\nOnward",
