  "lyrics": "I never normally check my phone 10 times in a minute\r\nI'm not the girl to be kept on hold 10 miles from the finish\r\nBut you got me losing all my cool\r\nSomehow I've given up all control\r\nI'm not shy to admit it\n\n'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend\n\n'Cause I'm looking for just a little more than a joyride in the evening\n\nDon't need to run around town with you every night\n\nYou can pick me up whenever you like\n\n'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend\n\n\n\nTest drive, test drive\n\nTest drive, test drive\n\n\n\nThey're telling me not to fall too hard 'cause I'm bound to regret it\n\nWarning me to keep up my guard, but each time I forget it\n\n'Cause girl, they don't know you like I do\n\nI see a different side to you\n\n\n\n'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend\n\n'Cause I'm looking for just a little more than a joyride in the evening\n\nDon't need to run around town with you every night\n\nYou can pick me up whenever you like\n\n'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend\n\n\n\nThis is not normal, I hear them calling\n\nIt's a bit out of character for me\n\nFuck what they're saying, my mind ain't changing\n\nWeighed it all up and I know the dangers\n\nKnow I got you and know you got me\n\nThat's all that we need, we're running off fumes\n\nI know, I won't let you go\n\n\n\n'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend\n\n'Cause I'm looking for just a little more than a joyride in the evening\n\nDon't need to run around town with you every night\n\nYou can pick me up whenever you like\n\n'Cause I don't really mind, just don't make me your test drive for the weekend\n\n\n\nTest drive, test drive\n\nTest drive, test drive for the weekend\n\nTest drive, test drive\n\nTest drive, test drive for the weekend",
