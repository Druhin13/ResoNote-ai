  "lyrics": "My heart is beating fast, sun is beating down\r\nYour song is in my head and it keeps spinning around\r\nLike walking streets of gold with diamonds in my eyes\r\nI can't explain it how the world just comes to life\r\nSing it over, I'll sing it over\n\nNo doubt, no doubt\n\nOh You make me feel\n\nSing it over, I'll sing it over\n\nNo doubt, no doubt\n\nYou make me feel this way, yes\n\nYou make me feel this way\n\n\n\nSo close to something, something I've never seen\n\nSleeping awake, maybe it's somewhere in between\n\nFelt like a fugitive staring at the gun\n\nNo longer chasing me, no, I don't have to run\n\n\n\nSing it over, I'll sing it over\n\nNo doubt, no doubt\n\nOh You make me feel\n\nSing it over, I'll sing it over\n\nNo doubt, no doubt\n\nYou make me feel this way\n\nYou make me feel this way\n\n\n\nYou make me feel this way\n\nYou make me feel this way\n\n\n\nLike an ocean wave in the wind\n\nIt's a moment I won't forget\n\nLike an ocean wave in the wind\n\nClose my eyes, I'm a child again\n\nYou make me feel this way, yeah\n\nYou make me feel this way, yeah\n\n\n\nSing it over, sing it over\n\nOh, You make me feel this way",
