  "lyrics": "Take everything you have in front of you\r\nMake every movement, do it to the groove\r\nYou will not be hungry for long if you're working\r\nAnd what would be the point if you didn't deserve it?\r\n8 long months later I feel better\n\nI try to decompress all the things that tend to mess me up\n\nThey always mess me up\n\nAnd you were never conscious of all the good that surrounds you\n\n\n\nWake up to the rhythm of the city and I try to remember\n\nEven my brothers have some trouble with each other sometimes things fall apart\n\nIt’s the way that things are\n\nIt’s the way that it is\n\n\n\nStill, and I might, you have to suffer\n\nYou were never an example of someone who was givin’ up\n\nYou’re never givin’ up\n\nAnd you had all the options, you probably needed someone around you\n\n\n\nEven when you split me up, groovin' to the sound of the laughter\n\nAnd if I listen to it closely I can still hear all the love in his heart\n\nEvery time I take a look at the skyline it makes me feel better\n\nCause I just miss you down here where the other people try to move on\n\n\n\nNow you’re a star\n\nIt’s the way that things are\n\nIt’s the way that it is\n\nDrivin’ that car",
