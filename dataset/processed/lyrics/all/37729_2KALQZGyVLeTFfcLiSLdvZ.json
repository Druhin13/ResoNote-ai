  "lyrics": "Speak to darkness in your lowest ebb;\r\nOnly silence\r\nThere's no future, only past regrets\r\nMeditate on them\r\nSuspended in infinite blackness\n\nSo numb, agony is no distraction\n\nContempt for life replacing sadness\n\n\n\nIs this clarity or madness?\n\nTemporary energy and matter\n\nThe will to live is irrevocably damaged\n\n\n\nA listless spirit wants to leave the world\n\nSweet oblivion\n\nVital essence grinding to a halt\n\nWe are all at fault\n\n\n\nFalling from the creaking rafters\n\nPressure, so much worse than you imagined\n\nBurning, death's umbilica unravels\n\n\n\nDrifting from his sweet embrace\n\nGasping for breath, staring in the grave\n\nOnly fear, as what little light left fades\n\n\n\nAnd on the pedestal, these words appear\n\n\"Look on my works ye mighty, and despair!\"\n\n\n\nNegated by the unbearable truth\n\nAll-consuming psychotic fugue\n\nFall to a lightless self-destructive end\n\nFor there is a monster in the heart of all men\n\n\n\nHearken to nightmares of futility enshrined\n\nIn sleepless terrors born of the mind\n\nAnd upon the horizon of the waking world\n\nTime stands still\n\n\n\nDamnation is our destiny\n\nExistence is disease\n\nOur screams are the music of reality\n\n\n\nRelinquish all your earthly bonds\n\nAnd bow before the god of madness\n\nLet him untether you from pain\n\nStep outside the circle and be saved\n\n\n\nCrippled by the triviality, the insanity of existing\n\nA mockery; this master plan, crushed by the hand of fate\n\n\n\nNo solace in this hopeless cycle\n\nAt one with fear and the darkness\n\nAttain mastery over shadow\n\nPurge trepidation from your heart\n\n\n\nYour adversary is within, these mental chains are your prison\n\nMalignant love of your projected self; a toxic delusion\n\n\n\nChaos, decay, withering away\n\nThe sense of self, starting to fade",
