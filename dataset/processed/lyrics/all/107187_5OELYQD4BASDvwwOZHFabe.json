  "lyrics": "She came from Providence, the one in Rhode Island \nWhere the old-world shadows hang heavy in the air \nShe packed her hopes and dreams like a refugee \nJust as her father came across the sea \nShe heard about a place \n\nPeople were smiling \n\nThey spoke about the red man's way \n\nAnd how they loved the land \n\nThey came from everywhere \n\nTo the Great Divide \n\nSeeking a place to stand \n\nOr a place to hide \n\n\n\nDown in the crowded bars \n\nOut for a good time \n\nCan't wait to tell you all \n\nWhat it's like up there \n\nThey called it Paradise, I don't know why \n\nSomebody laid the mountains low \n\nWhile the town got high \n\n\n\nThen the chilly winds blew down \n\nAcross the desert \n\nThrough the canyons of the coast \n\nTo the Malibu \n\nWhere the pretty people play \n\nHungry for power \n\nTo light their neon's way \n\nAnd give 'em things to do \n\nSome rich men came and raped the land \n\nNobody caught 'em \n\nPut up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus, people bought 'em \n\nAnd they called it Paradise, \"the place to be,\" \n\nThey watched the hazy sun\n\nSinking in the sea \n\n\n\nYou can leave it all behind \n\nAnd sail to Lahaina \n\nJust like the missionaries did \n\nSo many years ago \n\nThey even brought a neon sign that said, \"Jesus is coming\" \n\nThey brought the white man's burden down \n\nThey brought the white man's reign \n\nWho will provide the Grand Design ? \n\nWhat is yours and what is mine ? \n\nThere is no more new frontier \n\nWe have got to make it here \n\nWe satisfy our endless needs, \n\nAnd justify our bloody deeds, \n\nIn the name of Destiny \n\nAnd in the name of God \n\nAnd you can see them there \n\nOn Sunday morning \n\nStand up and sing about \n\nWhat it's like up there \n\nThey call it Paradise, I don't know why \n\nYou call some place Paradise \n\nKiss it good-bye.",
