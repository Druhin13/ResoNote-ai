  "lyrics": "In between moons\r\nI was the sea, I was the sea\r\nIn between stars\r\nI was the salt, I was the salt\r\nWild and vulgar were the ones that you could see\r\nThe ugly idols not cherished by me\n\n\n\nIn between moons\n\nI was the spring, I was the spring\n\nIn between stars\n\nI was the iron, I was the iron\n\nWashed and scrubbed from morning till night\n\nThe sky is heavy on my shoulders, but alright\n\n\n\nIt happened so very long ago\n\nWe don't know when or how\n\nNobody knows what we're doing here even now\n\n\n\nIn between moons\n\nI was the sea, I was the sea\n\nIn between stars\n\nI was the salt, I was the salt\n\nYou put your hope at the bottom of the jar\n\nSent down a swarm of bees to sting from afar\n\n\n\nI turn the axe around in my hands\n\nThrow me in the fire\n\nWarm yourself, kid yourself a little while\n\n\n\nIn between moons\n\nI was the spring, I was the spring\n\nIn between stars\n\nI was the iron, I was the iron\n\nThe best you couldn't\n\nNo, you didn't love enough\n\nAnd afterwards, you loved far too much\n\n\n\nI don't know how I've come to see the world\n\nExclusively through your eyes\n\nEverything I buy and eat and do with you in mind",
