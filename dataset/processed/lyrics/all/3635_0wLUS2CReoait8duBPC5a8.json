  "lyrics": "Hands behind your back\r\nDon’t move stick em up I told ya\r\nBet ya never had it like that\r\nLooking down the barrel of a soldier\r\nLife comes at you fast when you’re broke down cold all alone and piling up on you major\r\nTry not to listen to the voice in the back of your head telling you you’re in danger\n\n\n\nTuff like gorilla heavy n sharp like iron\n\nPhysically mentally spiritually fit like a lion\n\nNever tell yourself you can’t do nothing\n\nEven di small axe can make the big tree buckle\n\n\n\nFly fast like a speeding bullet\n\nVybez stay red hot and cannot cool it\n\n\n\nBarriers no match for this big boy gunning wit the rock\n\nAnd just watch when mi go threw it\n\n\n\nUh huh\n\n\n\nHard times not strange to us\n\nElevated with the best now they Envy us\n\nStepping on out of the concrete and dust\n\nJ Boog Iration dangerous!\n\n\n\nThe fire burning, the tides are turning\n\nAnd times of changing, in many nations\n\nWho really wants a war?\n\nGotta get in where you fit in when you listen to the rhythm if you with it then you fight back\n\nOne time worldwide let it light up\n\nCultivatin’ the energy in the room, ceremony for the prophets\n\nLet it be known that it’s on; that it’s poppin’\n\nWe unify and evolve in the process\n\nSun is rising",
