  "lyrics": "I hear you talking when I'm on the street, \nYour mouth don't move but I can hear you speak. \nWhat's the matter with the boy? \nHe don't come around no more, \nIs he checking out for sure? \nIs he gonna close the door on me? \n\n\n\nI'm always hearing voices on the street, \n\nI want to shout, but I can't hardly speak. \n\nI was making love last night \n\nTo a dancer friend of mine. \n\nI can't seem to stay in step, \n\n'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me. \n\n\n\nAnd I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, \n\nI only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping. \n\n\n\nI'm zipping through the days at lightning speed. \n\nPlug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed. \n\nHeading for the overload, \n\nSplattered on the dirty road, \n\nKick me like you've kicked before, \n\nI can't even feel the pain no more. \n\n\n\nBut I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, \n\nI only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping. \n\n\n\nFeel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene. \n\nFeel so mesmerized all that inside me. \n\nThe sunshine bores the daylights out of me. \n\nChasing shadows moonlight mystery. \n\nHeaded for the overload, \n\nSplattered on the dirty road, \n\nKick me like you've kicked before, \n\nI can't even feel the pain no more. \n\n\n\nBut I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming, \n\nI only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping.",
