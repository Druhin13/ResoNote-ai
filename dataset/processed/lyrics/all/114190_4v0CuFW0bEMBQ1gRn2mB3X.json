  "lyrics": "Yeah, it’s over, it’s over, I’m circling these vultures\r\nGot me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten\r\nLast time I saw you, said “What’s up?” and pushed right through\r\nThen I tried to catch you but we’re always on the move\r\nAnd now it’s over, we’re sober, symptoms of the culture\r\nAnd the night ain’t getting younger, last call’s around the corner\n\nFeeling kinda tempted and I’m pouring out the truth\n\nJust fading out these talkers ‘cause now all I want is you\n\nJust sayin’\n\n\n\nCome over here and sit next to me\n\nWe can see where things go naturally\n\nJust say the word and I’ll part the sea\n\nJust come over here and sit next to me\n\nAnd I’ll take you high, high\n\n\n\nWell, I ain’t frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk\n\nIt's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop\n\nLast time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light\n\nBut I’m here to tell you I’m not trying to change your mind\n\nIt’s alright, ooh, it’s alright, oooh\n\n\n\nYeah, come over here and sit next to me\n\nWe can see where things go naturally\n\nJust say the word and I’ll part the sea\n\nJust come over here and sit next to me\n\nAnd I’ll take you high, high, high, high\n\n\n\nIt's alright\n\nIt's alright\n\nIt's alright\n\nIt's alright\n\n\n\nSo come over here and sit next to me\n\nWe can see where things go naturally\n\nJust say the word and I’ll part the sea\n\nJust come over here and sit next to me\n\n\n\nIt's alright",
