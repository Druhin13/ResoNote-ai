  "lyrics": "How come knots always loosen?\r\nGuess I tie myself to the loose ends\r\nBut I push, I press\r\nI lost my bets\r\nAnd who knows if I'll get ’em back?\n\nHow do kings lose their fortune?\n\nIsn't love based on devotion?\n\nBut I push, I press\n\nGot 25 statues on my chest\n\nAnd who knows if I'll get ’em off?\n\n\n\nNow all I got left is my pulse\n\nAll I got left is my pulse\n\nTrying to get it all back\n\n'Cause I gave away everything\n\nEverything gets lost\n\nAll I got left is my pulse\n\n\n\nCouldn't hear the voice of reason\n\nPressure here, tie the rope, stop the bleeding\n\nBut I push, I press\n\nGot 25 statues on my chest\n\nAnd who knows if I'll get 'em off?\n\n\n\nNow all I got left is my pulse\n\nAll I got left is my pulse\n\nTrying to get it all back\n\n'Cause I gave away everything\n\nEverything gets lost\n\nAll I got left is my pulse\n\n\n\n'Cause I gave away everything\n\nEverything gets lost\n\nAll I got left is my pulse",
