  "lyrics": "Same old scenario\r\nOne guy's young and one guy's old\r\nOne's in love and sittin' on dough\r\nAnd one's already walked that road\r\nOne's on year number 33\r\nAnd one just bought that diamond ring\n\nOne says \"Dad, so how'd you do it?\"\n\nThe other just laughs and says \"There ain't nothin' to it\"\n\n\n\nJust try to quit smokin' and reel back the drinkin'\n\nDon't always tell her everything you're thinkin'\n\nAnd dance her when she needs dancin'\n\nYou get up and go to work, get up and go to church\n\nCrawl up in that bed right next to her and listen\n\nInstead of having all the answers\n\nThen he slapped him on the back and said\n\n\"Son, you can breathe, there ain't nothin' to it\"\n\n\n\nThere'll be trouble along the way\n\nWords will fly and dishes break\n\nThe baby comes in and money goes out\n\nYou will learn to ride the ups and downs\n\nYou'll wanna quit a million times\n\nBut if you hang on, the years unwind\n\nAnd when you get to see your blushing bride\n\nTurn beautiful at 35, or 45, or 55\n\n\n\nYou'll be glad you quit smokin' and reeled back the drinkin'\n\nDidn't always tell her everything you were thinkin'\n\nAnd danced her when she needed dancin'\n\nYou got up and went to work, got up and went to church\n\nCrawled up in that bed right next to her and listened\n\nInstead of having all the answers\n\nIt's only love and all of us go through it\n\nAnd if I had to do it again you know I'd do it\n\nThere ain't nothin' to it\n\nNo, there ain't nothin' to it",
