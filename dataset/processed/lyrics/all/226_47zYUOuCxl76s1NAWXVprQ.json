  "lyrics": "Just a boy with no story tryna find his way now\r\nHe's clever but never been thrown to the wall to miss the crowed\r\nThe silence seems so loud\r\nAnd in is head he gets knocked down\r\nBut he's focused\r\nHe's motive is to make himself proud\n\n\n\nI've got to be honest with myself that I'm gonna get burned\n\nNothing has changed and the tables have turned\n\nI've lost so many friends hope they find me again\n\nI come back a man but until then\n\nI'll hold on tight\n\n\n\nI feel so naked, I'm breaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down\n\nThese years have been wasted, I'm faded\n\nBut I can't wait to say look at me now\n\nI'm a ghost, oh I should be\n\nPebels kicking around the seems\n\nI feel naked, I'm shaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down, down, down\n\n\n\nJust a boy on the ladder thinking he matters\n\nWhat's his problem anyway\n\nHe's got to get up and go\n\nCause he thinks he knows how to not be alone\n\nBut it's you\n\n\n\nI've got to be honest with myself that I'm gonna get burned\n\nNothing has changed and the tables have turned\n\nI've lost so many friends hope they find me again\n\nI come back a man but until then\n\nI'll hold on tight\n\n\n\nI feel so naked, I'm breaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down\n\nThese years have been wasted, I'm faded\n\nBut I can't wait to say look at me now\n\nI'm a ghost, oh I should be\n\nPebels kicking around the seems\n\nI feel naked, I'm shaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down, down, down\n\n\n\nMy world is on the line\n\nI'm feeling like doubted, I wanna be fine\n\nGotta listen to my heart and not my head\n\nBreathe in and breathe out, start over again\n\nPut this to rest\n\n\n\nI feel so naked, I'm breaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down\n\nThese years have been wasted, I'm faded\n\nBut I can't wait to say look at me now\n\n\n\nI feel so naked, I'm breaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down\n\nThese years have been wasted, I'm faded\n\nBut I can't wait to say look at me now\n\nI'm a ghost, oh I should be\n\nPebels kicking around the seems\n\nI feel naked, I'm shaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down, down, down\n\n\n\nI'm naked, I'm breaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down\n\nI'm wasted, I'm faded\n\nBut silence is too loud\n\nI'm naked, I'm breaking\n\nMy walls are crumbling down\n\nI'm wasted, I'm faded\n\nMy walls are crumbling down, down, down",
