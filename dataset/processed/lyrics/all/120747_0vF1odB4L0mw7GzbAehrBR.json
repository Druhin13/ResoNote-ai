  "lyrics": "Well I bet my soul on a six string gamble\r\nAnd I climb like hell through the brush and the bramble\r\nEven though I had my doubts, told myself don't look down\r\nAnd I turned that hill into a pile of gravel\r\nIt was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock\n\nOnly a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop\n\nIt just took a little step, a right then a left\n\nThen a couple million more, who's counting?\n\nYeah, that's only a mountain\n\n\n\nWell you better know the bottom if you wanna be a climber\n\n'Cause there's always another one a little bit higher\n\nJust when I think I'm finally done I'm staring at another one\n\nSo I reach down deep and I lace 'em up tighter\n\n\n\nIt was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock\n\nOnly a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop\n\nIt just took a little step, a right then a left\n\nThen a couple million more, who's counting?\n\nYeah, that's only a mountain\n\n\n\nNow I'm standing at the top with the sweat behind me\n\nYeah, you gotta look up if you ever wanna find me\n\n\n\nIt was only a mountain, nothing but a big ol' rock\n\nOnly a mountain, it ain't hard if you don't stop\n\nIt just took a little step, a right then a left\n\nNow I'm standing at the top just shouting\n\nYeah, that's only a mountain\n\nIt's only a mountain, it's only a mountain\n\nOnly a mountain\n\nOnly a mountain, it was only a mountain",
