  "lyrics": "Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer\r\nTonight's moving fast but we ain't taking it slower\r\nYou hit me harder than a drink does\r\nYou're gonna take me all the way up\r\nSomething about you baby, got me going crazy\r\nI don't know what to do\n\n\n\nI've never met a girl like you\n\nThat's ever done it quite like you do\n\nYour kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks\n\nYour lips are just the cherry on top\n\nI've never been high like this\n\nTurn out the lights and let me breathe you in\n\nYour eyes are so diamond, body so gold\n\nAnd I don't want to let you go\n\nI've never met a girl like you\n\n\n\nLove how you say my name and make it sound so sexy\n\nLove how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me\n\nI'm talking slow motion all night long\n\nBaby, love you with the lights on\n\n\n\nI've never met a girl like you\n\nThat's ever done it quite like you do\n\nYour kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks\n\nYour lips are just the cherry on top\n\nI've never been high like this\n\nTurn out the lights and let me breathe you in\n\nYour eyes are so diamond, body so gold\n\nAnd I don't want to let you go\n\nI've never met a girl like you\n\n\n\nI've never met a girl like you\n\nThat's ever done it quite like you do\n\nYour kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks\n\nYour lips are just the cherry on top\n\nI've never been high like this\n\nTurn out the lights and let me breathe you in\n\nYour eyes are so diamond, body so gold\n\nAnd I don't want to let you go\n\nI've never met a girl like you\n\nI've never met a girl like you",
