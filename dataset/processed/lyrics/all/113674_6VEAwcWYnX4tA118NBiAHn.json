  "lyrics": "The circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noise\r\nI love the shiny music that descends from overhead\r\nGordon knew the moment when the stars all turned around\r\nBut from that vantage point I frowned\r\nIf life were easy and not so fast\n\nI wouldn't think about the past\n\nI can't forget to turn the earth so both sides get their share\n\nOf darkness and of light\n\n\n\nSo now I wander over grounds of light and heat and sound and mist\n\nProvoking dreams that don't exist\n\nA circus of light where dreams can take flight\n\nIn the peacefulness dreaming dreams brings",
