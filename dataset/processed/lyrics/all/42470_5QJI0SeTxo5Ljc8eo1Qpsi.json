  "lyrics": "their questions concerns that I'll never learn/ you all left here too fast/ and I'd never look past this divine/ sight of seeing your eyes// he'll keep watching you sally/ she'll wait 6 months so gladly/ they just wanted this to be/ inside// (chorus) this is/ a beautiful lie/ that pulls you aside/ and whispers all that we tried hard to hide/ tonight we'll be sittting so high/ that no morning deadline could expire our grand time// its getting so cold that she/ wonders why fall whisked you so away/ I can't point out exactly if your thumb is pushing the right way/ he'll keep watching you sally/ she'll wait 6 months so gladly/ they just wanted this to be/ special // (chorus) this is/ a beautiful lie/ that pulls you aside/ and whispers/ all that we tried hard to hide/ tonight we'll be sittting so high/ that no morning deadline could expire our grand time// a kaliedoscope of changing hues/ a lighter room that we can use/ and if I said I knew it all/ then tape this conversation to your wall/ onto your wall// (chorus) this is a beautiful lie that pulls you aside and whispers/ all that we tried hard to hide/ tonight we'll be sittting so high/ that no morning deadline could expire our grand time//",
