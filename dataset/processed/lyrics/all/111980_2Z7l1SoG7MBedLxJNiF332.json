  "title": "Cheyenne",
  "lyrics": "She lives for the nightlife and trashy tattoos\r\nShe loves country music and broken-in boots\r\nNobody can blame her for the chip on her shoulder\r\nShe finds plenty of pool-table cowboys to hold her\r\nHer daddy says she was destined for sadness\n\nHer Grandmama Lily's to blame for the madness\n\nThe only forever she knew ended tragic\n\nSo she'll fall for the night while the neon light flashes\n\n\n\nIf I could trade love like Cheyenne\n\nIf I could be just as cold as the beer in her hand\n\nIf I could move men and mountains with a wink and a grin\n\nOh, if I could treat love like Cheyenne\n\n\n\nShe knows how to make him wild in the eyes\n\nComes on like a fever and sets him on fire\n\nI bet she won't even cry when it's over\n\nShe's fast like a train, nobody can slow her\n\n\n\nIf I could trade love like Cheyenne\n\nIf I could be just as cold as the beer in her hand\n\nIf I could move men and mountains with a wink and a grin\n\nOh, if I could treat love like Cheyenne\n\nI wish I could treat love like Cheyenne",
