  "lyrics": "A flock across my window\r\nGone when I look around\r\nUntil the sun gets longer\r\nThey're getting out of town\r\nWhere on earth in the world\r\nDo they go?\n\nDo their feathers freeze stiff\n\nIn the snow?\n\nHow should I know?\n\n\n\nBut I can bet you they'll come\n\nBack to the same old tree\n\nSince I was crawling they've been\n\nWatching over me\n\nIn the gardens\n\nThat ripple in the water\n\nClimbing higher up\n\nWhere nobody sees\n\nLook at the sky and spot the green\n\n\n\nAnd I heard that they weren't\n\nMeant to stay\n\nAnywhere the air chokes\n\nOr they get\n\nOn the flyway\n\n\n\nSo ride the rising currents\n\nI trust that I will see you again\n\nWhen I pick up the courage\n\nI hope that I can join you someday",
