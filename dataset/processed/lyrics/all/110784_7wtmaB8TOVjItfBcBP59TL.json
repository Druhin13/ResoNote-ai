Its written on your face\n\nSo take me for every moment that its worth\n\nHey Jade, do you think we'll make it through?\n\nAre you looking for the way out?\n\n\n\nI'm just outside before this burning house\n\nThe flames go down, but no one makes it out\n\nI'm terrified 'cause I've lost my fear of doubt\n\nBut the war is over now\n\n\n\nSo break me down, if it makes you feels alright\n\nShake me off, if it helps you sleep at night\n\nHold me down in the river, take my breath away\n\n\n\nTake my breath away\n\nTake my breath away\n\n\n\nSo break me down, if it makes you feels alright\n\nShake me off, if it helps you sleep at night\n\nHold me down in the river, take my breath away\n\n\n\nTake my breath away\n\nTake my breath away",
