  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Pocket par Miloux\r\nThere’s a hole in my pocket and it’s starting to leak\nIf you want us together you should find it and see\nFor the moment we wanted there’s a long, slow burn\nAll the highs that we wasted you could take them and turn it too\n\nTen summers I waited for something\nBut there’s no time that I don’t see\nAll I do is (all I do is)\nSpend every night in the day\nAnd all of the moments I live for\nI watch them go but I really need more\nAll I do is (all I do is)\n\nSpend every night in the day\n\nTake apart all my pieces I could watch them fly on\nTo the rooms and the places that I spent it all on\nThere’s a stone in my pocket but I kept it for you\nIf you want us together you should watch what we do\n\nMake all the space fill we could just relearn\nUse all the time 'til nothing could return\nI’ve lived like I’d known what was the reason I came here\nEven though I wanted all the things I couldn’t do there\nMake all the space fill we could just relearn\n\nUse all the time 'til nothing could return\nI’ve lived like I’d known what was the reason I came here\nEven though I wanted all the things I couldn’t do there\n\nTen summers I waited for something\nBut there’s no time that I don’t see\nAll I do is (all I do is)\nSpend every night in the day\nAnd all of the moments I live for\nI watch them go but I really need more\nAll I do is (all I do is)\nSpend every night in the day\n\nTen summers I waited for something\nBut there’s no time that I don’t see\nAll I do is (all I do is)\n\nSpend every night in the day\nAnd all of the moments I live for\nI watch them go but I really need more\nAll I do is (all I do is)\nSpend every night in the day",
