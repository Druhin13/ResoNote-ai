  "lyrics": "There's an answer here, if I look hard enough\r\nThere's a reason why I always reach for the harder stuff\r\nIt wasn't my daddy's way\r\nHe was down in the mines all day\r\nI know he wanted more than mouths to feed and bills to pay\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\n\n\nI ain't cut out for war, unless I know what I'm fighting for\n\nAnd there's nothing here but churches, bars, and grocery stores\n\nAin't much money in the old-time mandolin\n\nSo I cash my check and I drink 'til I'm on my ass again\n\n\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\n\n\nRemember when we could see the mountain's peak?\n\nThe sparkle off the amphibole?\n\nLike a giant golden eagle's beak\n\nNow they say no one wants the coal\n\n\n\nI thought about moving away\n\nBut what would my mama say?\n\nI'm all that she has left and I'm with her every day\n\nAs soon as the sun goes down\n\nI find my way to the Mustang Lounge\n\nAnd if you don't sit facing the window\n\nYou could be in any town\n\n\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole\n\nMaybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole",
