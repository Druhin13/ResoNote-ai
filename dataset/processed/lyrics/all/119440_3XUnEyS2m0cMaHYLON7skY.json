  "lyrics": "Fist raised if you call for reaction\r\nAin't nobody gonna fuck with me\r\nI can tell by the way that you're acting\r\nAnd we could both agree\r\nI never felt so low\n\nBut I love the way I look, yeah\n\nWith this bloody nose\n\nLook how many hits it took ya\n\n\n\nI mix pain with a little satisfaction\n\nThey go together all the same to me\n\nI'm just trying to stay ahead of the action\n\nAnd we could both agree\n\n\n\nI never felt so low\n\nBut I love the way I look, yeah\n\nWith this bloody nose\n\nLook how many hits it took ya\n\nHere I go down this broken road\n\nMy smile still shows through my bloody nose\n\nStill, I go\n\nStill, I go\n\nYeah, I go\n\n\n\nI smile, but there's blood in my reflection\n\nThere's violence in the poetry\n\nWhen it's over, there's no resurrection\n\nAt least for you and me\n\n\n\nI never felt so low\n\nBut I love the way I look, yeah\n\nWith this bloody nose\n\nLook how many hits it took ya\n\nHere I go down this broken road\n\nMy smile still shows through my bloody nose\n\nStill, I go\n\nStill, I go\n\nYeah, I go\n\n\n\nWords are just like violence\n\nToday I'll break the silence\n\nThis could be goodbye, kid\n\nDo you see me when you close your eyelids?\n\nToday I'mma get back up\n\nFists raised, let's get close up\n\nYour life won't be so rough\n\nGet the fuck up 'cause we've had enough\n\n\n\nHere we lay\n\nIn our final hours like dying flowers\n\nThe price we pay\n\nAs you struggle for power that your ego devours\n\n\n\nHere I go down this broken road\n\nMy smile still shows through my bloody nose\n\nStill, I go\n\nStill, I go\n\nYeah, I go\n\n\n\nWords are just like violence\n\nToday I'll break the silence\n\nThis could be goodbye, kid\n\nDo you see me when you close your eyelids?",
