Rico!\nHuh yeah, Rico!\n\nWith some white bitches screamin' YOLO\nLemonade for the shade, Jesus saves, I don't\nPussy taste like ice cream, come and get this strawberry yum-yum\nPut it in his face, now he got a candy crush\nI call that a sugar rush, he call me his sugar plum\nHe call me his little princess, I call him my sponsor\nHe know that I'm crazy, he call me his little monster\n\nBitches ain't even eatin' pasta, bitch I'm eatin' lobster\n\nYeah, yeah, I'm the ice cream truck\nWhen the niggas see me, all the boys want some\nAll the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks\nI seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, \"Ew! What the fuck?\"\nHuh huh-huh, I'm the ice cream truck\nWhen the niggas see me, all the boys want some\nAll the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks\nI seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, \"Ew! What the fuck?\"\nHuh yeah\n\nHe tried it, I denied it like shit, duh\n\nHe text my phone, I ain't replyin' like shit\nThat nigga broke, I can tell, it's like a sixth sense\nBitches real mad but, how more mad can you get?\nIn real life I'm a shark, you a goldfish\nHere's my dick real quick, can you hold it?\nBitches these days gettin' bolder and bolder\nGot the weight of the world on my shoulders\nBut I'm still\n\nI'm the ice cream truck\nWhen the niggas see me, all the boys want some\nAll the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks\nI seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, \"Ew! What the fuck?\"\nHuh huh-huh, I'm the ice cream truck\nWhen the niggas see me, all the boys want some\n\nAll the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks\nI seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, \"Ew! What the fuck?\"\nHuh yeah\n\nHello?",
