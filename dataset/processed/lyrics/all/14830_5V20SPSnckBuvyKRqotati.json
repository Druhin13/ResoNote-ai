  "lyrics": "There once was a man who would cry out his eyes\r\nLaughing and singing his sorrow\r\nTomorrow and time after time\r\nSomewhere lost in his mind\r\nBack at the scene of the crime\r\nWalking in search of a friend for a night\n\nBetween a rock and a quarry\n\nOh sorry but you're not my type\n\nI won't put up a fight\n\nPlease lead me back to the light\n\nPlease lead me back\n\n\n\nBack to the light\n\nBack to the track with a knack for your type\n\nFlashback to my black bachelor life\n\nThat I left in the past with the passion of Christ\n\nA massive assassin on past international nights (?)\n\nFuck your feelings we ain't talking about fear\n\nAnd know my niggas not talking about beer\n\nWhen they say that they got a taste for a natural light\n\nDon't let your impulse make you a slave\n\nDon't let it take you away\n\nTo a place with an ace and a spade\n\nWhere you ache for the state (?)\n\n(?) Making in a year what they make in a day\n\nLocked in a cage with your generational rage\n\nHate generates renegades\n\nShowing their ass to the crowd\n\nCause they can't take it to the stage\n\nBeen feeling real good man\n\nWhen I see myself\n\nFirst time in my life feeling like I can finally be myself\n\nCashews on special\n\nShit I might treat myself\n\nI drop science not history bitch\n\nI don't repeat myself\n\nNigga be mad I said it\n\nY'all niggas not gon' set it\n\nY'all niggas wait for permission to engage\n\nMotherfucker I been wedded\n\nIn your DNA I'm embedded\n\nRap game Sallie Mae y'all indebted (?)\n\nPray to the Lord for a course that'll feed me\n\nLong as it leads me\n\n\n\nPlease lead me back to the light\n\nPlease lead me back to the light\n\n\n\nIf you are on the receiveing end of this message\n\nCongratulations, you made it",
