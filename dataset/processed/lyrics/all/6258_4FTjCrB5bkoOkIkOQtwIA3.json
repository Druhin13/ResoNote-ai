  "lyrics": "So will I\r\nGod of creation\r\nThere at the start, before the beginning of time\r\nWith no point of reference\r\nYou spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light\n\n\n\nAnd as You speak\n\nA hundred billion galaxies are born\n\nIn the vapour of Your breath the planets form\n\nIf the stars were made to worship, so will I\n\nI can see Your heart in everything You've made\n\nEvery burning star, a signal fire of grace\n\nIf creation sings Your praises, so will I\n\n\n\nGod of Your promise\n\nYou don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void\n\nFor once You have spoken\n\nAll nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice\n\n\n\nAnd as You speak\n\nA hundred billion creatures catch Your breath\n\nEvolving in pursuit of what You said\n\nIf it all reveals Your nature, so will I\n\nI can see Your heart in everything You say\n\nEvery painted sky, a canvas of Your grace\n\nIf creation still obeys You, so will I\n\n\n\nIf the stars were made to worship, so will I\n\nIf the mountains bow in reverence, so will I\n\nIf the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I\n\nIf everything exists to lift You high, so will I\n\nAnd if the wind goes where You send it, so will I\n\nIf the rocks cry out in silence, so will I\n\nIf the sum of all our praises still falls shy\n\nThen we'll sing again a hundred billion times\n\n\n\nGod of salvation\n\nYou chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride\n\nOn a hill You created\n\nThe light of the world abandoned in darkness to die\n\n\n\nGod of creation\n\nThere at the start, before the beginning of time",
