  "lyrics": "This that fire, pass a light\r\nIt'll burn slow\r\nCasually, gradually\r\nDefying gravity as I let go\r\nNo wires, I'm flying\r\nMagic, right?\n\nPull a hat outta rabbit, right?\n\nNever thought I could have it all\n\nThen again I never really had it right\n\nI'm moving through this movie like my life's duty is to live unruly you\n\nShoulda never introduced me to the beauty in the darker side of heaven's view\n\nCoogi fit her booty very well\n\nHopefully she never kiss and tell\n\nHopefully we never see the sun\n\nDon't try keepin' up, I'm on the run\n\n\n\nTryna keep it humble in a world full of egos, gangsters and evils\n\nPlayer in the game but I'm making my own rules\n\nAnd I'm pulling up in something foreign, foreign\n\nYea, I'm pulling up in something foreign, foreign\n\n\n\nI pulled this out for you, my newest coupe\n\nGrip the horse, I'll take you 'round the loop\n\nClose your eyes, your heart available\n\nLand on earth, and cruise through Malibu\n\nGave you time, now give your drawers the boot\n\nRub the skins, I found that heaven's true\n\nMelt the sun and keep the moon alive\n\nDry the winds, and moist behind the five\n\nCan't pretend the greatest sin alive\n\nStroke, you come and go beyond the fake\n\nTake you down, the frown go up your face\n\nArch your back and bend it back in place\n\nFuck you good, I'll fuck you good, I know\n\nSnap your book to know where else to go\n\nForeign place, a foreign whip to drive\n\nFailed at life, then failing you, now I'm (I'm)\n\n\n\nTryna keep it humble in a world full of egos, gangsters and evils\n\nPlayer in the game but I'm making my own rules\n\nAnd I'm pulling up in something foreign, foreign\n\nYea, I'm pulling up in something foreign, foreign",
