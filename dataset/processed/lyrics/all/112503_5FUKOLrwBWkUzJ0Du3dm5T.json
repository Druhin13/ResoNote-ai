  "lyrics": "Well I got caught in Panama City\r\nTryin' to buy some beer for some Georgia girls\r\nAnd I got wore out by my daddy\r\nFor stealin' cigarettes from the Smokes and more\r\nAnd all my friends would get away\r\nSeems I'd get caught, plain as day\n\nI look the blame for every little thing\n\n\n\nBut I got away with you\n\nAnd somehow I still ain't been found out\n\nIt's a crazy truth\n\nLike I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz\n\nAnd I walked in the Louvre\n\nAnd the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house\n\nI bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels\n\nAnd I got away with you\n\n\n\nWell lookin' like you do\n\nOn its damn own, should be a crime\n\nLet alone a fool like me\n\nHand in hand with you, should be doin' time\n\nBut here we are runnin' free\n\nGuess someone turned the other cheek\n\n'Cause there ain't no blue lights in the rear view\n\n\n\nGuess I got away with you\n\nAnd somehow I still ain't been found out\n\nIt's a crazy truth\n\nLike I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz\n\nAnd I walked in the Louvre\n\nNow the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house\n\nI bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels\n\nAnd I got away with you\n\n\n\nI'll take it all, the fails, the falls\n\nThe county jails and one phone calls\n\nI do it all again if I had to\n\n\n\n'Cause I got away with you\n\nSomehow girl, I still ain't been found out\n\nIt's a crazy truth\n\nLike I strolled out the gates of Alcatraz\n\nAnd I walked in the Louvre\n\nNow the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house\n\nI bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels\n\nAnd I got away with you\n\nWhen I got away with you\n\nYeah, I got away with you",
