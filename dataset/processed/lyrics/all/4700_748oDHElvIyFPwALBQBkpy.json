  "lyrics": "Sie sind das Essen und wir sind die jäger\r\nOur names won't be remembered\r\nIf we die like trampled flowers\r\nI refuse to be forgotten\r\nWritten off as less than worthless\n\n\n\nScream and cry\n\nBut none will hear you\n\nPlead and beg\n\nBut none will help you\n\n\n\nYou no longer live as cattle\n\nWill you rise and join the battle?\n\n\n\nThere are beings that live off our fears\n\nAnd their words are like knives\n\nAs they play with our lives\n\nThey'll try to control you\n\nAs if they own you\n\nWill you let them steal your freedom?\n\n\n\nChannel the anger swelling inside you\n\nFighting the boundary 'till you break through\n\nDeep in your soul, there's no hesitation\n\nSo make yourself the one – the JAEGER\n\n\n\nThere is a wildfire inside you\n\nBurning desire you can't extinguish\n\nYour crimson arrow\n\nRips through the twilight\n\nThis is the moment for war\n\n\n\nHunt your prey and act\n\nDraw your arrow back\n\nNever let ‘em get away\n\n\n\nSet the arrow free\n\nOn your enemy\n\nNever let ‘em get away\n\n\n\nPull the bowstring back\n\nJust before it snaps\n\nFeel the tension in your fingers\n\n\n\nAs they’re frozen still\n\nGo in for the kill\n\nMaking sure no life will linger\n\n\n\nIt’s not the hunter - Not the weapon\n\nTo guarantee the kill, all that counts in the end\n\nIs your determination\n\nRivaling the hunger of your slayer’s will\n\n\n\nWe are the hunters!\n\nUnforgiving like a raging fire\n\nYes – We are the hunters!\n\nMerciless, we are as cold … as … ice\n\nWe are the hunters!\n\nLet the arrow nearly draw you in\n\nYes – We are the hunters!\n\nStrike at anything that comes … your … way\n\n\n\nOnly few and far between know that victory takes sacrifice\n\nOnly they can really see – see it through and offer up the price\n\n\n\nIf you think your dreams come true easily\n\nThen, my friend, you’re in for a surprise\n\nCause nothing in this world will come free\n\n\n\nFoolish decisions in this illusion\n\nCaught up your reckless bravery\n\nPawn to the freedom, fighting in your chains\n\nVictory is out there waiting\n\n\n\nFreeing your life is just the beginning\n\nBecause the onslaught is now commencing\n\nReclaim the land and then the horizon\n\nOnto the world, if you so desire\n\n\n\nThere is a wildfire inside you\n\nBurning desire you can't extinguish\n\nYour crimson arrow\n\nRips through the twilight\n\nThis is the moment for war",
