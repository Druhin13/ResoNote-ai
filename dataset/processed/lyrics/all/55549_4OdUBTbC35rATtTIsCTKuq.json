  "lyrics": "He needs me\rHe doesn't know it, but he needs me\rAnd so no matter where he goes\rThough he doesn't care\rHe knows that I'm here\rHe needs me\rI ought to leave him, but he needs me\rI know that I ain't very bright\rJust to tag along\rOh, but right or wrong\rI'm his and I'm here\rAnd I'm gonna be his friends or his lover\rCause my one ambition is\rTo wake him and make him discover\rThat he needs me\rI've got to follow where he leads me\rOr else he'll never know that I need him\rJust as he needs me",
