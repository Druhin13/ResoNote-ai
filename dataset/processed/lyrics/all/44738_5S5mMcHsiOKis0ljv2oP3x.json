  "lyrics": "My mother taught me to ask questions\r\nShe said, \"That boyfriend will not do\"\r\nI talked yet I still never listened\r\nSomehow she always still rings true\r\nI counted the days until my birthday\r\nSome cosmic adventures will ensue\n\nI drove my mom along the highways\n\nDown roads, we never changed the tune\n\n\n\nShe said leave your past tomorrow\n\nAnd don't leave those skulls to dry\n\nDon’t fill your holes with sorrow\n\n'Cause you'll never be left alive\n\nBend those rules, they’re so thin\n\nAnd I'm talking to the window\n\nIt's not safe, it's not safe\n\nJust don't lean on me tomorrow\n\n\n\nI question what's between the trees\n\nI feel the earth beneath the greens\n\nI wonder what's between the oceans\n\nThe ones, she points them out to me\n\n\n\nShe said leave your past tomorrow\n\nAnd don't leave those skulls to dry\n\nDon’t fill your holes with sorrow\n\n’Cause you'll never be left alive\n\nBend those rules, they’re so thin\n\nAnd I'm talking to the window\n\nIt's not safe, it's not safe\n\nJust don’t lean on me tomorrow\n\n\n\nIt's not safe, it's not safe\n\nIt's not safe, it's not safe\n\nIt's not safe, it's not safe\n\nIt's not safe",
