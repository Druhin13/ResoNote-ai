  "lyrics": "Somebody said everyday was gonna be sunny skies\r\nOnly Marvin Gaye and lingerie, I guess somebody lied\r\nStarted discussing it to fighting then don't touch me please\r\nTo let's stop the madness, come lay with me\r\nTruth be told, I'm waving my flag before it goes bad\n\nGuess we made it this far on for better or worse\n\nI want to feel it even if it hurts\n\nGuess I gotta cry to get to the other side\n\nIt's gold cause we gon' survive\n\n\n\nWe stay on the floodlines, but we're still here after the ball drops\n\nWe go so hard, we lose control\n\nThe fire starts, then we explode\n\nWhen the smoke clears, we dry the tears\n\nOnly if love and war\n\n\n\nSometimes you're my hero\n\nYou gotta let go this place\n\nSometimes you're my enemy\n\nAnd an angry me\n\nWell they see chill in a life\n\nAnd im laying on your chest\n\nDont know what happen, cause things just will let\n\nBut here we go back dow that road\n\nThat's just the way that it goes\n\n\n\nGuess we made it this far on for better or worse\n\nI want to feel it even if it hurts\n\nGuess I gotta cry to get to the other side\n\nAs long as you're there i'll survive\n\n\n\nWe stay on the floodlines, but we're still here after the ball drops\n\nWe go so hard, we lose control\n\nThe fire starts, then we explode\n\nWhen the smoke clears, we dry the tears\n\nOnly if love and war\n\n\n\nAs long as we make up that storm every right when it's over\n\nYou know im going home\n\nRight back where I belong\n\nI take it up inside me\n\n\n\nAnd We stay on the floodlines, but we're still here after the ball drops\n\nWe go so hard, we lose control\n\nThe fire starts, then we explode\n\nWhen the smoke clears, we dry the tears\n\nOnly if love and war",
