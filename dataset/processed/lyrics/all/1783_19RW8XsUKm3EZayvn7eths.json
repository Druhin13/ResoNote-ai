  "lyrics": "I must be honest\r\nUnder the surface\r\nIt grinds like a blender\r\nThe sound of two voices\r\nMy heart seems to fail me\r\nIt put me in a stranger's bed\n\nIt hurt who I love the most\n\nI'll never trust it again\n\n\n\nThat's why I don't want what I want\n\n'Cause what I want, it just might kill me\n\nAnd I won't think of my needs\n\n'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me\n\n\n\nEnvy is endless\n\nI used to put mistakes up on a board\n\nCompare how mine sticks\n\nNext to the rest of the worlds'\n\nThat got me nowhere but miles from changing\n\nNow I've got deep stains\n\nAnd bleach won't erase them\n\n\n\nThat's why I don't want what I want\n\n'Cause what I want, it just might kill me\n\nAnd I won't think of my needs\n\n'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me\n\n\n\nCall me on everything\n\n'Cause I can't see how it looks from your perspective\n\nCall me on everything\n\n'Cause I can't help myself and I need your protection from me\n\nI lose every time\n\nI lose every time\n\nI lose every time\n\n\n\nYou think you're inspiring\n\nPosting slogans on a photo of the sky\n\nYou're letting sleeping dogs lie\n\nIt's not so simple as\n\nDo what makes you happy\n\nIf that's the same thing\n\nThat will destroy me\n\n\n\nThat's why I don't want what I want\n\n'Cause what I want, it just might kill me\n\nAnd I won't think of my needs\n\n'Cause what I need, I know there's never enough for me\n\nI must be honest\n\n(For me)\n\nUnder the surface\n\nIt grinds like a blender\n\n(I know there's never enough for me)\n\nThe sound of two voices\n\nMy heart seems to fail me\n\n(For me)\n\nIt put me in a stranger's bed\n\nIt hurt who I love the most\n\n(What I need, I know there's never enough for me)\n\nI'll never trust it again",
