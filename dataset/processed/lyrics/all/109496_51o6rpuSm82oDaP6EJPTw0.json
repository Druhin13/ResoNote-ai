  "lyrics": "There's always something, somewhere, that's running through my mind\r\nI know it's going nowhere but I still chase it\r\nThere's always something, somewhere, that I'm supposed to find\r\nIt's like a piece is missing, and I can't place it\r\nBut I wanna feel the ocean's spray\n\nDrink in the sun as it surrounds me\n\nBut something, somewhere's always pulling me away\n\n\n\nStay deep in the moment, just breathe\n\nFeel the flow of all things in the moment's sway\n\nWhy don't you stay?\n\n\n\nThere's always something, somewhere, that's breathing down my neck\n\nAnd I could run forever and never shake it\n\nThere's always something, somewhere, that's pressing on my chest\n\nAnd I don't really know if I'm gonna make it\n\n\n\nBut I wanna feel the wind's embrace\n\nEach blade of grass between my fingers\n\nBut something, somewhere's always pulling me away\n\n\n\nStay deep in the moment, just breathe\n\nFeel the flow of all things in the moment's sway\n\nWhy don't you...\n\nStay deep in the moment, just breathe\n\nFeel the flow of all things in the moment's sway\n\nWhy don't you stay?\n\n\n\nBut something, somewhere's always pulling my away\n\nWhy don't you stay?\n\nWhy don't you...\n\n\n\nStay deep in the moment, just breathe\n\nFeel the flow of all things in the moment's sway\n\nWhy don't you...\n\nStay deep in the moment, just breathe\n\nFeel the flow of all things in the moment's sway\n\nWhy don't you...\n\nStay deep in the moment, just breathe\n\nFeel the flow of all things in the moment's sway\n\nWhy don't you stay?",
