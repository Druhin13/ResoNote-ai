  "lyrics": "Boy I saw you soon as you came bouncin' through the door \nYou and your man's and them just look over the floor \nStarted doing your thing \nAnd it made me notice you even more \nThe way you turned around and looked at me \nIt seemed as though you must have somehow felt me staring on the low \n\nSomething tells me your the kind of guy I'd like to get to know \n\n\n\nI ain't even gonna front \n\nI ain't even gonna lie \n\nSince you walked up in the club \n\nI've been giving you the eye \n\nWe can dance if you want \n\nGet it crackin' if you'd like \n\nIt must be a full moon \n\nFeels like one of those nights \n\n\n\nIs this the first time that I'm seeing you around? \n\nCould you be visiting or are you new in town? \n\nAnd whatever the case \n\nI'm feeling you right here and right now \n\nYour smile and all the love you show \n\nIt lets me know that you like what you see and wanna get to know me too \n\nAnd this could very well be the start of something special \n\nI'm happy that I met you ... baby \n\n\n\nI ain't even gonna front \n\nI ain't even gonna lie \n\nSince you walked up in the club \n\nI've been giving you the eye \n\nWe can dance if you want \n\nGet it crackin' if you'd like \n\nIt must be a full moon \n\nFeels like one of those nights \n\n\n\nI ain't even gonna front \n\nI ain't even gonna lie \n\nSince you walked up in the club \n\nI've been giving you the eye \n\nWe can dance if you want \n\nGet it crackin' if you'd like \n\nIt must be a full moon \n\nFeels like one of those nights \n\n\n\nI didn't think that I'd come here tonight \n\nAnd meet someone like you and start feeling the way I do \n\nSeems like we've known each other most of our lives \n\nAfter one conversation \n\nThis must be right \n\n\n\nI ain't even gonna front \n\nI ain't even gonna lie \n\nSince you walked up in the club \n\nI've been giving you the eye \n\nWe can dance if you want \n\nGet it crackin' if you'd like \n\nIt must be a full moon \n\nFeels like one of those nights",
