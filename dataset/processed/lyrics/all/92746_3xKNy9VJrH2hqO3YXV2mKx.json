  "lyrics": "Well, you had all my love in the palm of your hand\r\nBut that wasn't enough and I don't understand why\r\nI gave you all my time, now it's yours; isn't mine, no\r\n'Cause you stole all the love from the palm of my hand\r\nI thought time and some space\n\nMight just heal all this pain\n\nBut I know that it's hopeless, yeah\n\n\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\nThere's not enough left for me to move on\n\nYeah, you took every piece\n\nBut the one that I needed was you all along\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\n\n\nLost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight\n\nAnd the more I got to know you, the more you would get from me\n\nHow could I be so blind? Captivated by those eyes\n\nI lost my head off my shoulders, no, I wasn't thinking straight\n\n\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\nThere's not enough left for me to move on\n\nYeah, you took every piece\n\nBut the one that I needed was you all along\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\n\n\nI thought time and some space\n\nMight just heal all this pain\n\nBut I know that it's hopeless, yeah\n\nI thought time and some space\n\nMight just heal all this pain\n\nBut I know that it's hopeless, yeah\n\n\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\nThere's not enough left for me to move on\n\nYeah, you took every piece\n\nBut the one that I needed was you all along\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?\n\n\n\n(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)\n\nHow can I love? Yeah\n\n(When my heart is half gone)\n\nOh, my heart is half gone\n\n(How can I love? Yeah, yeah)\n\nOh, you took every piece\n\nAnd the one that I need is you all along\n\n(When my heart is half gone)\n\nHow can I love when my heart's half gone?",
