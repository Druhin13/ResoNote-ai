  "lyrics": "I had a way with words for a while\r\nYou call it substance over style\r\nNow I hear laugh but I don't see a smile\r\nI had a way with words for a while\r\nIf I had've known I would've stuck around\n\n'Cause what kinda man lets his brother down\n\nOh, while I was gone think about all that you found\n\nA dear old friend and a brand new sound\n\n\n\nI am one man\n\nI can do anything\n\nWe are not far\n\nWe can do anything\n\n\n\nIs the whole thing just a test?\n\nIs there something you should get off your chest?\n\nDon't keep me waiting on some SMS\n\nDon't keep it all so close to the vest\n\n\n\nI am one man\n\nI can do anything\n\nWe are not far\n\nWe can do anything\n\n\n\nOur return will come some day\n\nThe three of us will laugh and play\n\nI know that we can find a way\n\n\n\nPut it all behind us\n\nNothing to remind us\n\nTo put it all behind us\n\nThere'll be nothing to remind us\n\n\n\nWon't hold my breath, won't wait in vain\n\nWon't single you out, won't lay blame\n\nI won't protest but I won't be the same\n\n'Cause I'm the only one who has my name\n\n\n\nI am one man\n\nI can do anything\n\nWe are not far\n\nWe can do anything\n\n\n\nOne man\n\nI can do anything\n\nWe are not far\n\nWe can do anything\n\nDo anything\n\n\n\nI am one man",
