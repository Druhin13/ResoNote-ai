  "lyrics": "I had a way with words but you got my tongue\r\nYou had your way with me but you got me so damn wrong\r\nSo I said “you can have my heart if you promise you will lie awake. Running in the dark and trusting in the pain”\r\nIf it’s just one night I’ll make it last a lifetime\r\nI looked deep deep in my heart, so deep that I fell apart\n\nAll I see is a beautiful melody with a terrible harmony\n\nYou’re still my end game\n\n\n\nI’ll map the points, you join the dots\n\nBut I’ll lose my way because you’re just so god damn hot\n\nSo I said “you can have my heart if you promise you will lie awake. Running in the dark and trusting in the pain”\n\n\n\nIf it’s just one night I’ll make it last a lifetime\n\nI looked deep deep in my heart, so deep that I fell apart\n\nAll I see is a beautiful melody with a terrible harmony\n\nYou’re still my end game\n\n\n\nYeah, you’re still my end game\n\n\n\nYou can have my heart if you promise you will lie awake. Running in the dark and trusting in the pain\n\nYou can have my heart if you promise you will lie awake. Running in the dark and trusting in the pain\n\nYou can have my heart if you promise you will lie awake. Running in the dark and trusting in the pain\n\n\n\nIf it’s just one night I’ll make it last a lifetime\n\nI looked deep deep in my heart, so deep that I fell apart\n\nAll I see is a beautiful melody with a terrible harmony\n\nYou’re still my end game",
