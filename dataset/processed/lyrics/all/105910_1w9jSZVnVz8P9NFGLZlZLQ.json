  "lyrics": "Never wanna feel like I did back then\r\nSitting on the floor as the walls closed in\r\nRunning out of breath, suffocating\r\nGet me out, get me out\r\nOh, giving up was making a mess of me\n\nIt took me falling down to get on my feet\n\nRunning out of hope, You made me believe\n\nIn me now, in me now\n\n\n\nI found my faith dancing through the fire\n\nBy the grace of God, I'm a survivor\n\nThe voices telling me quit, they're only liars\n\nOnly liars\n\n\n\nHold on\n\nWhen the rope you've been holding is down to a thread\n\nHold on\n\nTo the air in your lungs when you've got nothing left\n\nAnd when your legs start to stumble\n\nRun to the light in the tunnel\n\nThe victory's worth all the struggle so\n\nHold on!\n\nHold, on, hold, o-o-on\n\nHold, on, hold o-o-on\n\nHold, on, hold, o-o-on\n\nHold on, hold o-o-on\n\n\n\nNever thought I'd get to a silver lining\n\nNow I'm waking up to a sun that's shining\n\nWe all got something inside that's worth\n\nFighting for, fighting for\n\n\n\nI found my faith dancing through the fire\n\nBy the grace of God, I'm a survivor\n\nThe voices telling me quit, they're only liars\n\nOnly liars\n\n\n\nHold on\n\nWhen the rope you've been holding is down to a thread\n\nHold on\n\nTo the air in your lungs when you've got nothing left\n\nAnd when your legs start to stumble\n\nRun to the light in the tunnel\n\nThe victory's worth all the struggle so\n\nHold on!\n\nHold, on, hold, o-o-on\n\nHold, on, hold o-o-on\n\nHold, on, hold, o-o-on\n\nHold on, hold o-o-on\n\n\n\nI found my faith dancing through the fire\n\nBy the grace of God, I'm a survivor\n\nThe voices telling me quit, they're only liars\n\nOnly liars!\n\n\n\nHold on\n\nWhen the rope you've been holding is down to a thread\n\nHold on\n\nTo the air in your lungs when you've got nothing left\n\nAnd when your legs start to stumble\n\nRun to the light in the tunnel\n\nThe victory's worth all the struggle so\n\nHold on!\n\nHold, on, hold, o-o-on\n\nHold, on, hold o-o-on\n\nHold, on, hold, o-o-on\n\nHold on, hold o-o-on\n\n\n\nHold on, hold on\n\nHold on\n\nHold on, hold on, yeah",
