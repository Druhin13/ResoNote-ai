  "lyrics": "Smile your little smile take some tea with me awhile. \nBrush away that black cloud from your shoulder. \nTwitch your whiskers. Feel that you're really real. \nAnother tea-time another day older. \nPuff warm breath on your tiny hands. \nYou wish you were a man \n\nwho every day can turn another page. \n\nBehind your glass you sit and look \n\nat my ever-open book: \n\nOne brown mouse sitting in a cage. \n\n\n\nDo you wonder if I really care for you, \n\nAm I just the company you keep? \n\nWhich one of us exercises on the old treadmill, \n\nWho hides his head, pretending to sleep? \n\n\n\nSmile your little smile take some tea with me awhile. \n\nAnd every day we'll turn another page. \n\nBehind our glass we'll sit and look \n\nat our ever-open book: \n\nOne brown mouse sitting in a cage.",
