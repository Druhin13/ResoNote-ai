  "lyrics": "You ain't been blue; no, no, no.\r\nYou ain't been blue,\r\nTill you've had that mood indigo.\r\nThat feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes\r\nWhile I sit and sigh, \"Go 'long blues\".\n\nAlways get that mood indigo,\n\nSince my baby said goodbye.\n\nIn the evenin' when lights are low,\n\nI'm so lonesome I could cry.\n\n\n\n'Cause there's nobody who cares about me,\n\nI'm just a soul who's\n\nbluer than blue can be.\n\nWhen I get that mood indigo,\n\nI could lay me down and die.",
