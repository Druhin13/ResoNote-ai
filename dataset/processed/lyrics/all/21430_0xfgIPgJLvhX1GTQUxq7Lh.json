  "lyrics": "As I wake to a sunset\r\nThe light dances on the Mersey\r\nAnd I think of the 96\r\nAs the tears fall down on me\r\nAnd there is courage\r\nThere is pride\n\nYou can see it in your eyes\n\nFight for justice fight for life\n\nThere are angel in these skies\n\n\n\nAs the night falls around me\n\nI see joy and devotion\n\nThese times will never leave\n\nLike the rain on the ocean\n\nThere is dignity and pride\n\nThere is poetry and life\n\nThere are ghosts within these stones\n\nThere's defiance in these bones\n\n\n\nAnd all the hatred they tried to throw at you\n\nBut you stayed so strong\n\nYeah all the hatred it never was the truth\n\nSo keep keeping on\n\nThis is forever\n\nWe'll never leave you now\n\nThis is forever\n\nWe'll never leave you now",
