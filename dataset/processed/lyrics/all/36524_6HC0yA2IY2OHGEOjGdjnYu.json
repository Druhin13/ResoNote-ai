  "lyrics": "Love is freewheeling, keeps me wakin' all night long \nBut just like makin' love, becomes a part of you \nNobody's losing when we get so satisfied \nBecause of you i've got to shouting out my love \n\nOpen your eyes, there's my love, turn it over \n\nOpen your eyes, it's no time to be afraid \n\nOpen your eyes, till the dawn's up and over \n\nOpen your eyes, there's you bed and it's made \n\n\n\nGimme that feeling and we'll rock it on out strong \n\nBut when you're makin' just like i do to you \n\nThe night is growing and i think we're gonna fly \n\nIt's just for you that i'll be shouting out my love",
