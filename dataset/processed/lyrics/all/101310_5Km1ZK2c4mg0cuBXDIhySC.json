  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\nTrill over everything, huh?\r\n[?] with me\r\nI was brought up on these PA streets\r\nRaised off Efectos and Three Patin Suites\r\nRest in peace Lil Don and Dee Ray\n\nThey was the hardest to me\n\nSee this trill way of life is part of me like a artery\n\nAnd when it comes to, it ain’t no bargain\n\nSo to the ones misinformin’, here’s your fair warning\n\nWe trill over everything\n\nNah, for real\n\n\n\nMy Cadillac and my chrome rims\n\nStitch and tuck and my paint job\n\nVogue tires, my neon lights\n\nTrunk on bang and my shit hard\n\nTop drop and my trunk pop\n\nWood grain and it’s all new\n\nSpruced up and I’m juiced up\n\nAnd my deuce chunked when I fall through\n\nPiece 'n chain and my gold ring\n\nRolex and that desert lid\n\nI’m G’ed up from the feet up\n\nWhen we meet up, you can tell the shit\n\nYou love me, I’m benevolent\n\nCross me, it’s malevolence\n\nYour bitch bad, but mine better bitch\n\nPut a pussy up, we could settle it\n\nI ride slow and I sit low\n\nHat cocked and my gun too\n\nWit my Levi’s and my Jordan 5’s\n\nWhite Tee that's how Bun do\n\nOnly roll with one crew\n\nOne side, one town\n\nThat’s PA, and that’s all day\n\nSun up ‘til it's sun down\n\nPimp City, Bun Town\n\nLive for it and die too\n\nDon’t disrespect when I slide through\n\nOr them trill niggas'll slide you\n\nI’m from the south, I’m a southern nigga\n\nCorn bread in the oven nigga\n\nBig woman give me lovin’ cousin\n\nYou can hate it or love it nigga\n\n\n\nEither you about it or you not\n\nIt’s trill over everything\n\nSome shit you can never change\n\nBitch I came up underground to the top\n\nWith diamonds against the wood grain\n\nWord to the candy frame\n\n\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\n\n\nYeah it's big Bun, I’m forever trill\n\nO.G. getting better still\n\nComing down, candy red Deville\n\nCan’t break me off nigga, bet a mil’\n\nDon't try me hoe, you already know\n\nIf you ever think about approaching me\n\nI’m self-made, self-paid\n\nNow nigga say he was coaching me\n\nAnd I don’t know what they told you\n\nBut fuck with me and I’ll fold you\n\nI’m not the one, neither hands or gun\n\nStep to Bun, that’s a bold move\n\nI’m cold nigga, [?] nigga\n\nI’m the equivalent, I’ll hurt your soul nigga\n\nThem lies that you told nigga\n\nI’m really livin’ the ignorance\n\nStraight up out of them backwoods\n\nDeep south, dirt roads\n\nTrill niggas that’ll hurt hoes\n\nPlay pussy, get your skirt rolled\n\nNow you exposed and it’s plain as day\n\nThat’s the price of them games you played\n\nAll them lies is about to arise\n\nIs some shit you just can’t explain, no way\n\nRep-Representing that south nigga\n\nGold teeth in my mouth nigga\n\nPray to God, but I’ll pull your guard slow\n\nMake me run up in yo house nigga\n\nI’m a man, you a mouse nigga\n\nMake it rain ‘til you doused nigga\n\nClean as fuck, you a louse nigga\n\nI’m carnivore, watch me pounce nigga\n\n\n\nEither you about it or you not\n\nIt’s trill over everything\n\nSome shit you can never change\n\nBitch I came up underground to the top\n\nWith diamonds against the wood grain\n\nWord to the candy frame\n\n\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\n\n\n(Check One Two, what it do?\n\nThis shit right, let’s go)\n\n\n\nThis H-Town where the Prince king\n\nPop my truck and let the lip sing\n\nTalkin’ about ejaculate a clipse scene\n\nGet the metal to your mouth like a lip ring\n\nGot even ‘cause I beat the odds\n\nNo hand you dig from the beach abroad\n\nLookin’ for super head, I’m Columbus shore\n\nFrom the glass to the floor when I stomp the yard\n\nMinty blue, Ben Frank just to paint the door\n\nSittin’ on vogue like a toilet seat\n\nH-Town nigga, where the Georgia beach?\n\nPockets on fed, but I hardly eat\n\nAin’t ‘bout money, then I hardly speak\n\nStill sell chicken, but avoid the beef\n\nBang, bang, bang, where the Ruger piece?\n\nBringin’ to your door like Uber Eats\n\nKing not born, I am the man\n\nAT&T nigga, I’m in demand\n\nCIC nigga, I’m in command\n\nBarrack, no drummer, go rollie on my hand\n\nPick the same braids with her brick gold\n\nShe a green light, yeah your bitch gold\n\nWon your hole moments where the dick go\n\nKeep it one hundred, you a miss-roll\n\nI’m 6 feet, starin’ at my sack\n\nI’m 6-4, sweet Jane Jones\n\nI’m Pimp C, church on Sunday\n\nOnly a bitch roll, sippin’ on oil\n\nNo Crisco, smokin’ on gas\n\nI’d Frisco, burner on debt\n\nBut I move nigga, quicker than diarrhea\n\nLet the shit go\n\n(Brrah!)\n\n\n\nEither you about it or you not\n\nIt’s trill over everything\n\nSome shit you can never change\n\nBitch I came up underground to the top\n\nWith diamonds against the wood grain\n\nWord to the candy frame\n\n\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\nIt’s all trill, fuck how they feel\n\nThat’s how it is\n\n\n\nTrill, trill, trill, trill, trill, trill, trill…",
