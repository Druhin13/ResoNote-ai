  "lyrics": "RBE X SOB that's the gang\r\nBeat Boy taught me\r\nAnd if I choose to ride\r\nThuggin' 'til the day I die\r\n'Cause they don't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd when the mama's cry\n\nThe morning of the homicide\n\nThey still won't give a fuck about us\n\n\n\nAnd then they wonder why, why so many niggas die\n\nAin't no hope, it ain't no jobs, just more statistics on the rise\n\nAnd then they wonder why, why so many niggas die\n\nJust more murders, more revenge, just more victims on the rise\n\nYou can look me in my eyes, the boy ain't never lied\n\nLord ain't never led me wrong, but the devil is a lie\n\nAnd the devil told the truth, but to the cops I told a lie\n\nWhen it's just you, yourself and you, and me, myself and I\n\nI know I'ma do my shit it ain't no question 'bout it\n\nWhen you grow up that's all you know, it ain't no questions 'bout it\n\nAnd then I went around the world, it made me wonder why\n\nWhy the grass a lot more greener on the other side?\n\nBut I ain't trippin', if it's pressure then it's on\n\nI know some niggas who ain't never made it home\n\nThey don't care whether we live, or if we don't\n\nThat's why I gotta tote this plastic and this chrome\n\n\n\nAnd if I choose to ride\n\nThuggin' 'til the day I die\n\n'Cause they don't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd when the mama's cry\n\nThe morning of the homicide\n\nThey still won't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd if I choose to ride\n\nThuggin' 'til the day I die\n\n'Cause they don't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd when the mama's cry\n\nThe morning of the homicide\n\nThey still won't give a fuck about us\n\n\n\nI'm thuggin' 'til I die\n\nI'm clutchin' when I ride\n\nAnd you be loose lip, and I ain't fuckin' wit' yo' kind\n\nKeep my distance from the pigs, they just wanna give me time\n\nLittle shit matter the most, so pay attention to the signs\n\nThey be tryna spread the peace, ain't no hope in that\n\nWhen you in that field by yourself, ain't no coachin' that\n\nGot problems wit' my brother, deal wit' me, now we both in that\n\nKeep this Glock on me for my safety it's a pole in that\n\nFeds lookin' for me? Yeah, but I'm already knowin' that\n\nThey tell us that we equal, that's a lie, they ain't showin' that\n\nTreat us like we dogs, tryna act like we don't notice that\n\nLivin' up in hell, it's so hard to gain my focus back\n\nDon't give a fuck about us, so I'm slidin' 'til my folks is back\n\nFeds can't keep a tab up on me nigga, got 'em overlap\n\nAnd I know some killers want me dead, so I'm over strapped\n\nYeah I know the world'll never change, I got over that\n\nBitch\n\n\n\nAnd if I choose to ride\n\nThuggin' 'til the day I die\n\n'Cause they don't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd when the mama's cry\n\nThe morning of the homicide\n\nThey still won't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd if I choose to ride\n\nThuggin' 'til the day I die\n\n'Cause they don't give a fuck about us\n\nAnd when the mama's cry\n\nThe morning of the homicide\n\nThey still won't give a fuck about us",
