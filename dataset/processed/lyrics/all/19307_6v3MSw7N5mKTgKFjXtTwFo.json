  "lyrics": "Meet at the point of Demarkation\r\nPostmarked signal from the fugitive zone\r\nSewn in the sleeve of a double agent\r\nIf found please return to my dearest turncoat\r\nThe doubt began to fill in my tiny furnace\r\nBillowing through thimbles\n\nI was caught off guard\n\nClosing ranks\n\nTo the aggrieved\n\nI have one last wish\n\nFor the one last throat to choke\n\nSaid I have one last throat to choke\n\n\n\nXEROXED IN CLOVER\n\n\n\nTHE PAPER TRAIL\n\nOF DIAMOND LAUREATES\n\n\n\nBurner in my pocket\n\nWhen the stingrays trace you\n\nBurning in my pocket\n\nGot a smoking gun\n\nTurn the other cheek?\n\nNo, I'm a stepping razor\n\nPulling on the leash of dogmas son\n\nWatching me for leaks\n\nA loyalist appraisal\n\nWar room in a church\n\nWhere the fair game broods\n\nClosing ranks\n\nTo the aggrieved\n\nI have one last wish\n\nFor the one last throat to choke\n\n\n\nXEROXED IN CLOVER\n\n\n\nDo you have that feeling\n\nOf adamant loathing?\n\n\n\nDo you have the feeling\n\nYou're going to be remote controlled?\n\n\n\nDo you have this feeling\n\nSoured by the years?\n\n\n\nDo you have this feeling?\n\n\n\nLook over my soldier\n\n\n\nDo you hear that breathing cheating me?",
