You're my only help\r\nAnd even though i know he's gone, he still watches from beyond like Obi Wan\r\nAnd even though i know he's gone, i till hear him from beyond like Obi Wan. so\r\nHelp me if you want. You're my only help\r\nHelp me if you want. You're my only help\n\n\n\nThe greatest man I've ever known in my life, is like picturing a furious style was white, I've got a lot from my father like my looks and my height, he used to stay at radio shows at night, and when he and my mom split, there were beef they couldn't be friends, so he picked me up and I'd stay with him on the weekends, no brother no sister only child, i look a lot like my father you can see it in my smile, got his wisdom got his knowledge you can hear it in my style, I hope i won't forget his voice, I haven't heard it in a while, got his number on my phone, still hard not to dial, all these tragedies and trial i could've turned out wild, i missed the funeral cuz i was in the hospital, so visit me in dreams whenever possible, i don't even know where to begin explain to my daughter how amazing my father was or should i even bother? cuz i don't have the words but i try when the clouds part, sky tellin' dad it's you, came to say hi, i throw a prayer in the air, even though there is no reply but, i know he'd watch my back till the day that i die, took me two years to write the song and every time i cry when i repeat it or i read it or i speak i'll just leave it, right here upon this beat and hold some attitude receive it, cuz you are too strong to just be gone, i can't see it\n\n\n\nAnd even though i know he's gone, he still watches from beyond like Obi Wan\n\nAnd even though i know he's gone, i till hear him from beyond like Obi Wan. so\n\nHelp me if you want. You're my only help\n\nHelp me if you want. You're my only help\n\n\n\nBut suppose if people do some bullshit we are having, it's humiliation, gotta believe in something, you have all this problems, so deep, that you can't just have them on your own, yeah, my bad, you're lucky you're blessed, it's a blessing\n\n\n\nHelp me if you want\n\n\n\nI promised you the great secret, and i will not disappoint you, this is the end of our adventure, Nasi hasanent, we came in search of the secret of immortality, to be relay gods, and here we are, mortals, more human than ever, if we have not obtained immortality, at least we have obtained reality, we began a fairy tail, and we came to life, but is this life reality? no, it is a film, we are images, dreams, photographs, we must not stay here, prisoners, we shall break the illusion, this is Maya, goodbye to the holy mountain, real life awaits us",
