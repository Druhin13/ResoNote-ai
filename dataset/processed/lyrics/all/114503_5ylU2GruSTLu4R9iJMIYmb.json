  "lyrics": "(Richard Carpenter/John Bettis)\r\nSuch a feelin's comin' over me\r\nThere is wonder in 'most ev'ry thing I see\r\nNot a cloud in the sky, got the sun in my eyes\r\nAnd I won't be surprised if it's a dream\n\n\n\nEverything I want the world to be\n\nIs now comin' true especially for me\n\nAnd the reason is clear, it's because you are here\n\nYou're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen\n\n\n\nI'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation\n\nAnd the only explanation I can find\n\nIs the love that I've found ever since you've been around\n\nYour love's put me at the top of the world\n\n\n\nSomethin' in the wind has learned my name\n\nAnd it's tellin' me that things are not the same\n\nIn the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze\n\nThere's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me\n\n\n\nThere is only one wish on my mind\n\nWhen this day is through I hope that I will find\n\nThat tomorrow will be just the same for you and me\n\nAll I need will be mine if you are here\n\n\n\nI'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation\n\nAnd the only explanation I can find\n\nIs the love that I've found ever since you've been around\n\nYour love's put me at the top of the world\n\n\n\nI'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation\n\nAnd the only explanation I can find\n\nIs the love that I've found ever since you've been around\n\nYour love's put me at the top of the world",
