  "lyrics": "Mother, I have gone astray, ooh\r\nI'm sorry, but I've lost my way, ooh\r\nEverybody knows my name here\r\nBut nobody really knows me, ooh\r\nIf I close my eyes real tight\n\nI can see what might have been\n\nIf I turn off all the lights\n\nI can sit and just pretend\n\nMother I'm afraid to fall, ooh\n\nI don't who else to call\n\n\n\nI wanna come home\n\nI wanna come home\n\nWhere the streets take me back to where I've gone\n\nWhere my feet feels steadier on the ground\n\nI wanna come home\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\n\n\nMother, can you hear my voice? Ooh\n\nCalling through the dense white noise, ooh\n\nI've been chasing dreams and stars, ooh\n\nAlong the way I lost my heart, ooh\n\n\n\nAnd if I sit alone real still\n\nSometimes I can feel you here\n\nMaybe you could take the wheel\n\nTry and get me out of here\n\nMother I have gone astray, ooh\n\nAnd tell me I will be okay\n\n\n\nI wanna come home\n\nI wanna come home\n\nWhere the streets take me back to where I've gone\n\nWhere my feet feels steadier on the ground\n\nI wanna come home\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\n\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?\n\nMother, can you take me home to you?",
