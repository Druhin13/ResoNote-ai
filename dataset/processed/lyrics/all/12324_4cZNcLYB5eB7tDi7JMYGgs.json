  "lyrics": "I made my way to the western wall, as the sun went down, I could hear them call for you\r\nAnd the words I heard in the ancient song were the same as the ones I've sung so long to you\r\nAnd when I touched the wall, the veil, it never felt so thin\r\nCause you are the Rock and the Cornerstone, You are the temple of flesh and bone\r\nAnd you are the door and the way back home again\n\nTo that city that we long for, that we feel so far away\n\nWhere the dawn will drive away our tears\n\nAnd we'll meet in the New Jerusalem someday\n\nMaybe next year\n\nMaybe next year\n\n\n\nAt the western wall I bowed my head, I knew that every word I read was true\n\nAs the prophet spoke from another age, and the song rose up from the sacred page to You\n\nAnd I never felt so near, I never felt so far away\n\nBut You tore the curtain and shook the ground, the saints woke up and they walked around\n\nAnd resurrection came to town that day\n\n\n\nLike in that city that we long for, that we feel so far away\n\nWhere the dawn will drive away our tears\n\nAnd we'll meet in the New Jerusalem someday\n\nMaybe next year\n\n\n\nThis is the place where Abraham cut lose the boy and he killed the ram instead\n\nAnd this is the place where Jesus said, you could tear down the temple and he'd raise it from the dead\n\nYou never felt so real, I never felt so close to You\n\nSo I'll weep and dance at the western wall and sing of the way you're making all things new\n\nCause the kingdom's here, but I know the kingdom's moving in\n\n\n\nSo maybe I'll meet you here next year\n\nIn the New Jerusalem, in the New Jerusalem...\n\n\n\nIn that city that we long for, that we feel so far away\n\nWhere the dawn will drive away our tears\n\nAnd we'll meet in the New Jerusalem someday\n\nMaybe next year\n\nMaybe next year\n\nNext year in the New Jerusalem\n\nNext year in the New Jerusalem\n\n\n\nNext year, next year\n\nNext year in the New Jerusalem\n\nNext year, next year\n\nNext year in the New Jerusalem\n\nNext year, next year",
