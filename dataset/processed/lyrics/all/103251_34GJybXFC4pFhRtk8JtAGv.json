  "lyrics": "Faith we abate, a perfect design of which we deprecate\r\nWe can't decipher this suppressive surge of desire\r\nAs I watch the hands of time cradle circumstance and consequence\r\nI reiterate that the hourglass is near its end and depleting swiftly\r\nTrace the edge along this line we drew within this narrow space\n\nMemories I can't recreate\n\nWreckage beyond what we could calculate\n\nAn affection that fluctuates\n\nFamiliar speech in a new tongue that I cannot translate\n\n\n\nWho's to say that our faith was kept in a safe place?\n\nAs we witness a weaker pulse and shallow breaths, the innocent fight\n\nTo take their life back, no surrender of light from their eyes\n\nPerpetrator, give back what's not yours to keep\n\nStolen destinations of contingency, ripped apart and vanishing\n\n\n\nMemories I can't recreate\n\nWreckage beyond what we could calculate\n\nAn affection that fluctuates\n\nFamiliar speech in a new tongue that I cannot translate\n\n\n\nThese wandering eyes provide confirmation of idle actions\n\nHolding keys to open doors, we're too afraid to enter\n\nWe scrutinize, but execution falls short\n\nDisgust for lack of action\n\nCover your face with your hands and look away\n\n\n\nMemories I can't recreate\n\nWreckage beyond what we could calculate\n\nAn affection that fluctuates\n\nFamiliar speech in a new tongue\n\nMemories I can't recreate\n\nWreckage beyond what we could calculate\n\nAn affection that fluctuates\n\nFamiliar speech in a new tongue that I cannot translate\n\n\n\nPerpetrator, give back what's not yours to keep",
