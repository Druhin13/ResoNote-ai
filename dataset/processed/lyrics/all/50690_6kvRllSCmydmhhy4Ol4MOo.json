  "lyrics": "Verse 1:\r\nSo you're the one I've waited on\r\nThe one I've been dreaming of\r\nNow that I know, it's hard to let go\r\nI don't want to lose your love\n\nPre-Chourus:\n\nBut what can I do, I can't make you stay here\n\nBut if you should choose to go your own way\n\nWhere ever you're going, whenever you turn\n\nRemember this moment, remember these words\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nI will, I will give up my life for you if you want it\n\nGive you my heart, you already own it\n\nI'll do anything, I'll go anywhere, it's true\n\nI will, I will, I will...\n\n\n\nVerse 2:\n\nI look in your eyes and I see our life\n\nSo full of happiness\n\nDo you see the same? Or just someone you'll blame\n\nFor things that you might've missed\n\n\n\nI don't want to weigh you down like an anchor\n\nIf that's how you see me now, I would rather\n\nLet you go free, just sail away\n\nIf that's what you need, if that's what it takes\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\n\n\nIf ever your day is done\n\nStill you feel you need someone to hold you... I will\n\nIf you ever need\n\nTo talk to somebody who really knows you.... Yes I will\n\n\n\nGive up my life for you if you want it\n\nGive you my heart, you already own it\n\nI'll do anything, I'll go anywhere, it's true\n\nI will, I will, I will...\n\nI will...love you",
