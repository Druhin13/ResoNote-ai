  "lyrics": "It was the night before, \nWhen all through the world, \nNo words, no dreams\r\nThen one day, \nA writer by a fire\r\nImagined all of Gaia\n\nTook a journey into a childless heart... \n\n\n\nA painter on the shore\n\nImagined all the world\n\nWithin the snowflake on his palm\n\nA dream of poetry, \n\nI'll tell is over\n\nCutting in, \n\nFalling back in to the stars... \n\n\n\nI am the voice of never, never land, \n\nThe innocence of dreams from every man, \n\nI am the empty grave of Peter Pan, \n\nA soaring kite against the blue, blue sky, \n\nEvery chimney, every moonlit sight\n\nI am the story that will read you real, \n\nEvery memory that you hold dear\n\n\n\nI am the journey, \n\nI am the destination, \n\nI am the whole mad tale\n\nThat grieves you\n\nAway to taste the night, \n\nFree and loose we fly! \n\nFollow the madness, \n\nHow do you know what's real?\n\n\n\nImaginarium, a dream emporium! \n\nCaress the tales\n\nAnd they will read you real\n\nA storyteller's game, \n\nInside he flicks the gate\n\nThe calling heart\n\nIs a limitless chest of tales... \n\n\n\nI am the voice of never, never land, \n\nThe innocence of dreams from every man, \n\nI am the empty grave of Peter Pan, \n\nA soaring kite against the blue, blue sky, \n\nEvery chimney, every moonlit sight\n\nI am the story that will read you real, \n\nEvery memory that you hold dear\n\n\n\nI am the voice of never, never land, \n\nThe innocence of dreams from every man, \n\nSearching heavens for another earth...\n\n\n\nI am the voice of never, never land, \n\nThe innocence of dreams from every man, \n\nI am the empty grave of Peter Pan, \n\nA soaring kite against the blue, blue sky, \n\nEvery chimney, every moonlit sight\n\nI am the story that will read you real, \n\nEvery memory that you hold dear\n\n\n\nI am the voice of never, never land, \n\nThe innocence of dreams from every man, \n\nI am the empty grave of Peter Pan, \n\nA soaring kite against the blue, blue sky, \n\nEvery chimney, every moonlit sight\n\nI am the story that will read you real, \n\nEvery memory that you hold dear.\n\n\n\n(Grazie a Luca (nightwisher) per le correzioni)",
