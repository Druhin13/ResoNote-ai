  "lyrics": "Barefoot front porch swingin', here all alone tracing my steps Tryna figure out what went wrong\r\nYou were here one minute then the next you leave\r\nNow I'm stuck here tryna breathe\r\nYou know that saying \"it ain't you, it's me\"\r\nBut it ain't you that's been going through hell\n\nIt ain't you with a heart to sell\n\nIt ain't you riding 'round this town\n\nWith a ghost in the shotgun seat\n\nIt ain't you that's been tryna call\n\nIt ain't you that still misses it all\n\nYou ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories\n\nIt ain't you, it's me\n\n\n\nWhen times were tough I just couldn't throw away\n\nThem old T-shirts and pics of us still framed\n\nI talk so loud they can feel my pain\n\nThe echo of you was here today\n\nI'm just stuck tryna find what it means\n\n\n\nBut it ain't you that's been going through hell\n\nIt ain't you with a heart to sell\n\nIt ain't you riding 'round this town\n\nWith a ghost in the shotgun seat\n\nIt ain't you that's been tryna call\n\nIt ain't you that still misses it all\n\nYou ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories\n\nIt ain't you, it's me\n\nYeah it's me\n\n\n\nBut it ain't you that's been going through hell\n\nIt ain't you with a heart to sell\n\nIt ain't you riding 'round this town\n\nWith a ghost in the shotgun seat\n\nBut no, it ain't you that's been tryna call\n\nIt ain't you that still misses it all\n\nYou ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories\n\nIt ain't you, it's me",
