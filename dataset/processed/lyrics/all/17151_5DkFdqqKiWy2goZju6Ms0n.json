  "lyrics": "Tried to crack down\r\nAll we'd been searching for, that relevant sound\r\nBut I keep knocking and there's no one around\r\nI fidget, fumble, confound, I taste the sweat from my brow\r\nBack on the ground\r\nIn 14 hours, thought I'd figure it out\n\nL.A. from Sydney, between window and aisle\n\nWas way more error than trial, another blank note to file\n\n\n\nI keep penning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMy notepad's empty 'cause my headspace is vacant\n\nAnd I'm still penning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMaybe an Adderall to help concentration\n\n\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\n\n\nHead in the clouds\n\nI'm daydream drifting 'cause my focus walked out\n\nThe clock keeps ticking while there's footsteps abound\n\nThat feed off pennies and pounds, they're getting hungrier now\n\nSubstance or style?\n\nRight now, got neither, got my eyes on the dial\n\nA single line feels 'bout the length of a mile\n\nTold this would all be worthwhile\n\nI need to wake up, wake up, wake up\n\nAnd still Iâ€™m thinking, when will I stop?\n\n\n\nPenning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMy notepad's empty 'cause my headspace is vacant\n\nAnd I'm still penning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMaybe an Adderall to help concentration\n\n\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\n\n\nPenning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMy notepad's empty 'cause my headspace is vacant\n\nAnd I'm still penning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMaybe an Adderall to help concentration\n\n\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\n\n\nPenning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMy notepad's empty 'cause my headspace is vacant\n\nAnd I'm still penning frustrations, I'm losing my patience\n\nMaybe an Adderall to help concentration\n\n\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out\n\nI'm freakin' out",
