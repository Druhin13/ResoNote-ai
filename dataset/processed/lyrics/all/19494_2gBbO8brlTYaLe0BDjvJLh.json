  "lyrics": "How can we forgive ourselves?\r\nFor what we have become?\r\nHow should we bear this burden?\r\nDisplace the things we've done?\r\nI loved you so fucking much\n\nIt nearly lasted a lifetime\n\nFuck! I scratched my heart out\n\nJust to watch it bleed...\n\n\n\nI wish I was kerosene, just to set myself on fire\n\nI wish I was kerosene, I'd burn all we've edified\n\nI wish I was kerosene, plain to set your world on fire\n\nI wish I was kerosene... just to feed the flames\n\n\n\nAnd a bottle of whiskey later I can still recall the shape of your face\n\nWhile I forgot my way home, while I forgot my own fucking name...\n\n\n\nWho even calls this place home?\n\nIn the best case it's a grave with a view\n\nI was never really here\n\nBut the streets still seem to know my name\n\n\n\nStay! Never mind the emptiness!\n\nLeave! Fire walks with me!\n\nYou kept a lot of secrets and I kept none\n\nI wish I could go back and keep some...\n\n\n\nI usually keep my sadness\n\nPent up deep inside\n\nWhere it can fester quietly\n\nTo become mental illness\n\n\n\nYou were so fucking afraid\n\nYou might be living a lie\n\nOh, poor you...\n\nI may have lived like twenty!\n\n\n\nI wish I was kerosene, just to set myself on fire\n\nI wish I was kerosene, I'd burn all we've edified\n\nI wish I was kerosene, plain to set yourself on fire\n\nI wish I was kerosene... at least to feed the flames\n\n\n\nThis will never be about life\n\nAlways about love and death\n\nThese are the only things that make me write\n\nThe things that let me bleed, that let me starve\n\n\n\nThe soil below me whispers my name and suggests:\n\nYou are done here... come home now?\n\nFace the triangle of growth, decline and decay\n\nCause the harder you struggle, the tighter the noose!\n\nThe tighter the noose!",
