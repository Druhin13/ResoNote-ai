  "lyrics": "When I wake up, no makeup, half naked, I feel like I’m the shit\r\nPardon my language, but hang ups do not define the kid\r\nNo, I’m not flawless, I’m scarred up and I’m fine with it\r\nMy body art a laundry list of all of life’s unkindnesses\r\nBut—I still sip tea and chant om, and live free, cause hardships and heartbreaks, turn to rap epiphanies\r\nAnd mom told me stay woke cuz all gold ain’t glistening\n\nChoose your words wisely cuz the all knowing’s listening\n\nBut, no worries. I’m Gucci\n\nMy thighs a lil juicy, my dialogue lil awkward, my idols still move me\n\nMy life is a movie, like Raheem and Mookie, I’m just trying to do the right thing, hope that it improves me\n\nMy bamboos are costume, sue me\n\nYou’ll be soon accustomed to me\n\nThis the moral, I got royal hemoglobin coursing thru me\n\nAnd my strength is now inhuman, I get that straight from my umi\n\nSigned and sealed from out the grill of yours and truly\n\n\n\nYou better shine on 'em baby, you a star. You betta\n\nBe exactly who you are-Forever\n\nCause they gon' try and change your heart. Don’t let 'em\n\nCause you're sure damn fine, just the way you are\n\nYou better shine on 'em baby, you a star. You betta\n\nBe exactly who you are-Forever\n\nCause they gon' try and change your heart. Don’t let 'em\n\nCause you're sure damn fine, just the way you are\n\n\n\nI ain’t get here overnight\n\nI was in that mirror like 4-5 times a week, with my mala beads reciting affirmations like holy rites\n\nAnd I still don’t know everything\n\nBut I guess confessions from 8 by 11s in studio sessions seem like it’s only right\n\nAnd trust me, this my therapy, fuck yo couch, Finna murk all these Murphy types funny styling me, shut your mouth\n\nTouch me, I’m slaughtering crews, squads, goons, teams, the queen is coming to rule your region, coming for all of your assets, plus your house\n\nI ain’t always have it in me\n\nNo tolerance for pretending\n\nI was 14 yrs old forcing pills down my throat so my baby fat diminished\n\nStill got the scars from cutting my wrists when I thought that life was finished\n\nNow they remind me what my lows look like now I know the sky’s the limit\n\nOk. Never claimed to be perfect\n\nThat’s an impossible dream\n\nI’m just saying that I’m worth it\n\nThat’s the responsible thing\n\nSpent half my life trying find my light from outside sources, while the only voice that mattered came from me\n\n\n\nYou betta shine on em baby, you a star. You betta\n\nBe exactly who you are-Forever\n\nCuz they gon try and change your heart. Don’t let up\n\nCuz You so damn fine, just the way you are\n\nYou betta shine on em baby, you a star. You betta\n\nBe exactly who you are-Forever\n\nCuz they gon try and change your heart. Don’t let up\n\nCuz You so damn fine, just the way you are\n\n\n\nWhen Roc go in, she too aggressive, that’s too masculine\n\nAnd her content lil too obsessive, just relax a bit\n\nShe say she god, that’s narcissistic, just the facts of it\n\nNah, I Don’t really eff with female rappers, that shit sacrilege\n\nGlad I learned early not to internalize every ink up\n\nDaddy told me with every opinion there comes a sphincter\n\nAnd they would rather see dem thots than popularize a thinker\n\nWhile them lion/lying archetypes is chasing cat, I’m trying Sphinx her\n\nRap pharoah, skin Caramello, apparel mainly vintage\n\nMarrow composed of warriors so every verse became a vengeance\n\nWent thru too much hell to not be fire, but they still feigning ignorance\n\nSo now I came to collect my just due with remaining interest\n\nBaby, I’m a star without the Flash, fame or Fenty\n\nCame out the dark lit up the entire game upon my entry\n\nKept it 100, messed around and gained another century in this, now I’m aimed to pop off til my mental chamber’s empty\n\nI’m unbothered, your standards is irrelevant, I might eff around and rock a baldie all just for the hell of it\n\nThey been trying to martyr me for ages cuz of my melanin\n\nSo now I’m soaking uv rays with shea slathered on my abdomen\n\nMy dude, I’m magic, my gang is goddess, my mood is savage, that’s Genghis Khan, these bars moving mountains, my range astonishing\n\nDangerous sonnets like raining comets, they blazing-trails thru planets, all hail this kind of amazing\n\nThat’s right, we’ll call it self love\n\nDiscovered I was dope, and indulged like upscale drugs\n\nAnd u could call me arrogant if that’s gon help love, but if you trying to knock me down, your demolitions failed, bruv\n\n\n\nYou betta shine on em baby, you a star.
