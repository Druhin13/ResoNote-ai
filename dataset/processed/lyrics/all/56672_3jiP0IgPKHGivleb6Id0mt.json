  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson On Fire par Mike Watson\r\nKeep you warm in a cold street\nWalking down you can hold me\nYou'll be okay\nYou'll be okay\nLocking eyes and we turn the key\nClose the door so nobody sees\nWhat you do to me\nWhat you do to me\n\nOn my mind, I feel your skin on mine\nI have no control when you're close\nYou see straight through me\nThere is nowhere to hide yeah\nWith you, I'm a ghost\n\nAnd I-I-I'm on fire for you\n\n'Cause no one burns me like you do\nAnd the smoke in your eyes\nNever fades late at night\nI am blinded 'till the morning light\n'Cause I-I-I'm on fire for you\n\nDark is here, try to see astray\nIt's a blur so a double take\nFor my heart race\nFor my heart race\nYou're the cause and effect\nI can never forget why\nYou're so perfect\nYou're so perfect\n\nOn my mind, I feel your skin on mine\nI have no control when you're close\nYou see straight through me\n\nThere is nowhere to hide yeah\nWith you, I'm a ghost\n\nAnd I-I-I'm on fire for you\n'Cause no one burns me like you do\nAnd the smoke in your eyes\nNever fades late at night\nI am blinded 'till the morning light\n'Cause I-I-I'm on fire for you\n\nAnd I-I-I'm on fire for you\n'Cause no one burns me like you do\n(I'm on fire for you)\n\nAnd I-I-I'm on fire for you\n'Cause no one burns me like you do\nAnd the smoke in your eyes\nNever fades late at night\n\nI am blinded 'till the morning light\n'Cause I-I-I'm on fire for you",
