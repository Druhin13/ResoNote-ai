  "lyrics": "I know my drinking from my daddy\r\nUsed to kick the wisdom when while he sipped up on his Brandy\r\nHe pushed the limit but that nigga used to whip it like a caddy\r\nNever saw the method to his madness\r\nSomeday's I would scream, \"I can't stand you\"\r\nAnd then he slipped up say he wished he never had me\n\nI closed the distance once that nigga moved to Cali\n\nI wish I never moved to Cali\n\nI can't even hold a grudge no more\n\nTough love, don't made me go work\n\nSame for the niggas that I really don't trust\n\nOnly when I'm drunk\n\nSo I think I call him up and say\n\n\n\nHe used to pray for them better days till they came 'round\n\nHate where I'm heading but I can't slow down\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down, hey\n\nBeen tryna make a change, I don't know how\n\nMaybe I was meant to take the long way 'round?\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down, hey\n\n\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down\n\n\n\nBarely on my own, see me on a row\n\nBut them innocence since I visit, hate to I see you getting old\n\nAnd I wished I never bend you for the things you didn't know\n\nSometimes I wish I had you to keep me on my toes\n\nHow it feel pops, to see your young boy getting money\n\nGot that deal pops, put a little back up in your pocket\n\nHere pops, I can pay you back for coming out for real pops\n\nFinally living like you lived\n\n\n\nHe used to pray for them better days till they came 'round\n\nHate where I'm heading but I can't slow down\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down, hey\n\nBeen tryna make a change, I don't know how\n\nMaybe I was meant to take the long way 'round?\n\nPray that I feel the same when I come down",
