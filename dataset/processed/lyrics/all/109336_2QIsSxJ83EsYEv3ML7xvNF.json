  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Lie For Love par Sabrina Carpenter\r\nI'm played out, it's late out\nI'm really hoping and you don't care\nThis pent up, momentum\nHe's starting to become aware\n\nI had the upper hand\nBut I don't, I don't\nI know, I know, I don't\nI had the upper hand\nBut I don't, I don't\nI know, I know, I don't\n\nWe can't get too romantic\nToo busy running high and low\nI just don't understand it\nWhy I lie, why I lie for love\n\nWe can't get too romantic\nToo busy running high and low\nI just don't understand it\nWhy I lie, why I lie for love\n\nIt's all there, it's not fair\nWhere will our heads be when it's done?\nWhen night falls, and you don't come\nI'll stay up waiting for the sun\n\nI had the upper hand\nBut I don't, I don't\nI know, I know, I don't\nI had the upper hand\nBut I don't, I don't\nI know, I know, I don't\n\nWe can't get too romantic\n\nToo busy running high and low\nI just don't understand it\nWhy I lie, why I lie for love\nWe can't get too romantic\nToo busy running high and low\nI just don't understand it\nWhy I lie, why I lie for love\n\nI had the upper hand but i,i,i\nI had the upper hand but i\nO-oh\n\nWe can't get too romantic\nToo busy running high and low\nI just don't understand it\nWhy I lie, why I lie for love\nWe can't get too romantic\nToo busy running high and low\n\nI just don't understand it\nWhy I lie, why I lie for love",
