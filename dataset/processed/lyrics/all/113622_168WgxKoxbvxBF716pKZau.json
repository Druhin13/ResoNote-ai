  "lyrics": "(Kerry Livgren / Steve Walsh)\r\nI'm woven in a fantasy, I can't believe the things I see\r\nThe path that I have chosen now has led me to a wall\r\nAnd with each passing day I feel a little\r\nmore like something dear was lost\n\nIt rises now before me, a dark and silent barrier between,\n\nAll I am, and all that I would ever want be\n\nIt's just a travesty, towering, marking\n\noff the boundaries my spirit would erase\n\n\n\nTo pass beyond is what I seek, I fear that I may be too weak\n\nAnd those are few who've seen it through to glimpse the other side,\n\nThe promised land is waiting like a maiden that is soon to be a bride\n\nThe moment is a masterpiece, the weight of indecision's in the air\n\nIt's standing there, the symbol and the sum of all that's me\n\nIt's just a travesty, towering, blocking out the light and blinding me\n\nI want to see\n\n\n\nGold and diamonds cast a spell, it's not for me I know it well\n\nThe treasures that I seek are waiting on the other side\n\nThere's more that I can measure in the treasure of the love that I can find\n\nAnd though it's always been with me, I must tear down the Wall and let it be\n\nAll I am, and all that I was ever meant to be, in harmony\n\nShining true and smiling back at all who wait to cross\n\nTHERE IS NO LOSS",
