  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson White Lines par Bones Owens\r\nI've been running down a dark road\nIt's been sketchy from the get go\nFifty miles till I get home\nAnd you know that I've been making good time\nSee the lights in the distance\nJust the ones I've been missing\nAnd my baby, she's a vision\nSo you know that I'll be making good time\n\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nAnd there ain't nobody changing my mind\n\nEngines running like a freight train\nHaven't seen you in a long day\n\nGot your picture by the speed bank\nSo you know that I'll be making good time\nCheck my hair in the rear view\nAin't scared, I'm a real dude\nCold stare like an ear blue\nAnd you know that I've been making good time\n\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nAnd there ain't nobody changing my mind\n\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nAnd there's just a couple more white lines\n\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\n\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nAnd there ain't nobody changing my mind\n\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nWon't sleep tonight till I see your face\nAnd there's just a couple more white lines\nAnd there's just a couple more white lines\nAnd there's just a couple more white lines\nAnd there's just a couple more white lines\nAnd there's just a couple more white lines",
