  "lyrics": "There’s things I do at times knowing it just don’t make sense\r\nBut I just do it anyway, I don’t know why it is\r\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\r\nI appreciate the wisdom out there blowing in the wind\r\nBut I never seem to hear it even when I’m listening\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\n\n\nWhy’s it only good advice that I tend to refuse\n\nMaybe I’m hard headed but I know that’s no excuse\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\n\n\nYeah I’ve tried to free my mind but something just ain’t sinking in\n\nIt’s almost in a language I can’t seem to understand\n\nBut I won’t try to justify and blame it all on fate\n\nMe and better judgment, we just don’t communicate\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\n\n\nPeople tell me this ol’ world is all cause and effect\n\nIn my case it seems like all the dots just don’t connect\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\n\n\nSome say spontaneity is something I don’t like\n\nI’ve made a few decisions that I wish I could take back\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me\n\nThe voice of reason never speaks to me",
