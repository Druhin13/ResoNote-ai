  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Big Lie par Joyce Manor\r\nDon’t you ever feel lonely\nBaby, I’ve been lonely my whole life\nGirls can be kind of controlling\nI wanna be controlled, I think it’d be alright\n\nEverybody thinks I’m joking\nIf it’s funny then hold me while cry all night\nMaybe we should watch it slowly\nWe can figure it out, it’s all a great big lie\n\n7:30 in the morning\nFeeling stoned in the glow of the streetlight\nSound of car doors gently closing\nBaby, I been lonely my whole life\n\nI never noticed the way she had it out for me\n\nI just supposed it’s like that for everyone\nSo understated, we’re never friendly anyhow\nJust tell me what you want me to do\nIf you were aimless, I’ll be what you were aiming for\nIf you get anxious I’ll put on “Morning, Morning” for you\nSo overstated, we’re never in the moment now\n\nUntil we’re washed away, child\nUntil we’re washed away, child\nUntil we’re washed away, child\nUntil we’re washed away, child\nUntil we’re washed away, child",
