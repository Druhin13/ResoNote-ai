  "lyrics": "Sinking once again\r\nGot no worries, I've found my chosen friends\r\nDrifting from all I've known\r\nWithin this solace, now I call my home\r\nBury your sorrow\n\nI'm feeling fine\n\nNo more tomorrow\n\nI've found my peace of mind\n\n\n\nTo wander without a care\n\nWhere nothing's ever judged, for I've had my share\n\nCut off from all I know\n\nSilence are the seeds I care to sow\n\n\n\nBury your sorrow\n\nI'm feeling fine\n\nNo more tomorrow\n\nI found my peace of mind\n\n\n\nAimless and down\n\nWith no concern\n\nShed my own skin\n\nTo perish and burn\n\n\n\nBury your sorrow\n\nI'm feeling fine\n\nNo more tomorrow\n\nI found my peace of mind",
