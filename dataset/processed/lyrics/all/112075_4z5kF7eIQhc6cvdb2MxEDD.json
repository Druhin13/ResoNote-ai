  "lyrics": "John Beyers blew three holes in my ride\r\nHe put two in the tires and one in the side\r\nSide panel of my 1969\r\nCamaro, and so it's John I must find\r\nSo I hopped in Pop's pick-up and cranked up the heat\n\nGot a clean .22 and some shells in the seat\n\nI lit up the dark and I shifted her down\n\nThis southside Swift Current boy's northside-bound\n\n\n\nJohn Beyers just bought him a whole mess of pain\n\nHe's a fool if he thinks he can do this again\n\n'Cause I'm crossin' that track just as soon as this train\n\nPulls out of the rail yard, ol' John's gonna pay\n\n\n\nJohn Beyers just bought him a whole mess of pain\n\nHe's a fool if he thinks he can do this again\n\n'Cause I'm crossin' that track just as soon as this train\n\nPulls out of the rail yard, ol' John's gonna pay",
