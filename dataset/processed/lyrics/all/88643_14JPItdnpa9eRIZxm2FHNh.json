  "lyrics": "I'm living but I'm feeling numb\r\nCan see it in my stare\r\nI wear a mask so falsely now\r\nAnd I don't know who I am\r\nDespite the worlds inside of me\r\nCursing me away\n\nI've noticed in others' eyes\n\nThat time is closing in\n\n\n\nAnd when the thunder breaks\n\nIt breaks for you and me\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\n\n\nThe future's looking rather grim\n\nA strange black tide\n\nDecisions lie with foolish men\n\nAlong with my life\n\nThey're choking and holding me\n\nExpecting me to fall\n\nBut only if I'm threatened\n\nWe'll see the tables turn\n\n\n\nAnd when the thunder breaks\n\nIt breaks for you and me\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\n\n\nOur world is under a sentence of death\n\nI was born underground\n\nBut when the pressure gets too much for me\n\nBye, bye\n\n\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\nTarantula, tarantula\n\nTarantula, tarantula",
