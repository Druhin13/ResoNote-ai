  "lyrics": "If I had a free spirit\r\nYou would probably appreciate it\r\nThat day we bonded like Chemical Brothers\r\nI was gonna be a pop star\r\nYou wrote it on your wall\r\nLittle did I know, did I know\n\nThere's a piece of my heart for you\n\nThere's a piece of my heart for you\n\nThe pain isn't nothing, though, I felt it\n\nThere's a piece of my heart for you\n\nThere's a piece of my heart for you\n\nI broke it in two for you, you can have it\n\n\n\nDon't call me a friend, ayy\n\nDon't call me a friend, yeah\n\nDon't call me a friend, ayy yeah\n\nYou know it's more than that\n\nIt's more than that\n\n\n\nI'm still figuring out how you tryna come across\n\nI don't got time for that\n\nAh, now you wanna break something, uh\n\nBreak my heart (Ahh)\n\nBreak my heart (Ahh)\n\nAnd I know, 'cause I saw\n\nThat's how this goes, ain't it?\n\nAin't it kinda fucked up? Ah, yeah\n\nWhen I think about it, when I think about it\n\nWhen I, when I, when I, I got friends\n\n[?]\n\nAh, now you wanna break something\n\nBreak my heart (Ahh)\n\nBreak my heart (Ahh)\n\nAh nah, I can't give up\n\nAh yeah\n\n\n\nSo I gave him an ultimatum, and I said, \"I can't just keep living and moving with you all over the United States without a commitment.\" There's no certainty, you know, of a future, and I wanted to have children, and that was important to me, so, we got married. I'm not sure, I think I would've waited to find... I probably would've held out longer to get married 'cause I, I just, I don't know. You never really know for sure, but I had serious doubts when I got married, and I, I should've listened to my heart more. 'Cause when you're young, you're idealistic, and you think your love is gonna change a person, but it really doesn't. They are who they are. Think it might make slight modifications, but they basically are who they are and who you see and who you feel that they are. So be cautious when you're searching, and don't just give your love away",
