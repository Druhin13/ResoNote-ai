Yeah\n\n\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\n\nIntoxicate me now with your lovin' now\n\nI think I'm ready now\n\nIntoxicate me now with your lovin' now\n\nI think I'm ready now\n\n\n\nTaste of your lips, I'm on a ride\n\n\n\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\n\nWith a taste of a poison paradise\n\nI'm addicted to you\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nAnd I love what you do\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nI said I love what you do\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?",
