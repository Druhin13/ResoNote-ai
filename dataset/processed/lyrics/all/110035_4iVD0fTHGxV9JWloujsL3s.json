Did your mama smoke cocaine?\n\nHave you ever seen a whole thang?\n\nWhat you drove through to the streets cause you grew up on short change?\n\nFucked up when the dope age\n\nIt remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change\n\nHad the part with the low fade\n\nI would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day\n\nDrive-by's, that was road rage\n\nThen we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang\n\nOld school play the O'Jays\n\nTryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage\n\nTryna\n\n\n\nDouble up\n\nThree or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up\n\nNever let a hard time humble us\n\nDo-do-double up\n\nI ain't tellin' no lies, I just (yeah)\n\nI ain't tellin' no lies, I just\n\nFive, four, three two\n\nThat's time, I got, to you\n\nThat money, my dreams, come true\n\nMy life, in diamonds, who knew?\n\nWho knew?
