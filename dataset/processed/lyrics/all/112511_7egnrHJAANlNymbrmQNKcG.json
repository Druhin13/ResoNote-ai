  "lyrics": "It must have been inside my head\r\nI’ve lost the hope that I have lived\r\nAnd now, at last, it comes to pass\r\nWe sleep, we dream, we have no less\r\nAlong the path we lost our way\n\nIt’s all a game that I must play\n\nAnd now the weak that fall\n\nReturn to ash, defeated after all\n\n\n\nFade away to the wicked world we left\n\nAnd I become the dark of you\n\nSay a prayer for the wounded heart within\n\nAs I become the dark of you\n\n\n\nLet go, we know this kind of life\n\nWe live, we breathe, we die\n\nThey call me to the light\n\nForever lost inside\n\n\n\nWith every dream we find\n\nWe feed, we burn, we lie\n\nThe fall of humankind\n\nThe everlasting light\n\n\n\nFade away to the wicked world we left\n\nAnd I become the dark of you\n\nSay a prayer for the wounded heart within\n\nAs I become the dark of you\n\n\n\nLet go\n\nSave this selfish world\n\nLet go\n\nSave this selfish world\n\nLet go\n\nSave this selfish world\n\nLet go\n\nSave this selfish world",
