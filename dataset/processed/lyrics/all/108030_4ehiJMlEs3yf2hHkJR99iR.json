  "lyrics": "That little kid in the window's looking out at the winter like:\r\n\"This whole world is mine if I can get this bitch to shine\"\r\nThere's no kind of friction to find\r\n'Cause ain't nobody runnin' towards the same finish line\r\nLooking at the dirty snow in the street make you believe\r\nEverybody must've just adjusted to the grief\n\nChoose what you use to motivate yourself\n\nYou can either hate me or you can hate yourself\n\n\n\nCan't trust your fears\n\nYou spent a whole bunch of years being judged by peers\n\nAll you wanted was to touch my ears\n\nAnd get inside of my head like: \"What the fuck's in here?\"\n\nHad to take space from the hazardous waste\n\nSave the rags for acid rain flashbacks\n\nIf it can wash off that awful toxic aftertaste\n\nMaybe that can replace all your trash bags\n\n\n\nBaby, I don't know, but you're obviously feeling yourself\n\nAnd that's a beautiful thing, I hope you're real with yourself\n\n'Cause all we got is ourselves and these mouths to feed\n\nAnd those keys on your belt that held you down on your knees\n\nWhatever dawg, I'm not the underdog\n\nI'm just a side effect of following my thumbs through the fog\n\nI'm outta here, all apologies to your kids\n\nYour whole forest on fire, hollerin' 'bout the bridge\n\n\n\nAnd everybody tryna do their best\n\nBut everybody's best didn't take the same piss test\n\nI guess I should expect resentment affects perspective and context\n\nAnd you've perfected your bomb threats\n\nYeah, we get high and we gon' die\n\nBut either way, those leaves don't lie\n\nAnd as the seasons go by, more friends say bye\n\nLess luggage makes it easier to fly\n\n\n\nAnd when the trees turn to skeletons, listen\n\nYou can hear the bones rattle in the wind\n\nIt's a delicate condition\n\nEverything's gotta go if you wanna know what's underneath the skin\n\nWe all have the capacity to take it there\n\nBut if I'm gonna use gravity to take it there\n\nThat's a delicate condition, I'm not in the position\n\nTo tell how you livin'\n\n\n\nAnd when the trees turn to skeletons, listen\n\nYou can hear the bones rattle in the wind\n\nIt's a delicate condition\n\nEverything's gotta go if you wanna know what's underneath the skin\n\nWe all have the capacity to take it there\n\nBut if I'm gonna use gravity to take it there\n\nThat's a delicate condition, I'm not in the position\n\nTo tell how you livin'\n\n\n\nAnd when the trees turn to skeletons\n\nYou can hear the bones rattle in the wind\n\nIt's a delicate condition",
