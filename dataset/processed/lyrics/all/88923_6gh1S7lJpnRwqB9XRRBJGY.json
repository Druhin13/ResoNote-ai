Waste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nBaby, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me, why not waste it on me? Waste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\n\n[RM]\nSo we don't gotta go there\nPast lovers and warfare\nIt's just you and me now (Yeah, yeah)\nI don't know your secrets\n\nBut I'll pick up the pieces\nPull you close to me now (Yeah, yeah)\n\n[ Jungkook, RM & Jimin]\nAnd I know there's no making this right, this right (Yeah)\nAnd I know there's no changing your mind, your mind (Oh)\nBut we both found each other tonight, tonight (Oh yeah)\nSo if love is nothing more than just a waste of your time\n\n[Jungkook, RM & Jimin]\nWaste it on me, waste it on me\n(Waste it on me)\nTell me, why not waste it on me?
