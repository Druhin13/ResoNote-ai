  "lyrics": "You'll remember me when the west wind moves\r\nUpon the fields of barley\r\nYou'll forget the sun in his jealous sky\r\nAs we walk in the fields of gold\r\nSo she took her love\n\nFor to gaze awhile\n\nUpon the fields of barley\n\nIn his arms she fell as her hair came down\n\nAmong the fields of gold\n\n\n\nWill you stay with me, will you be my love\n\nAmong the fields of barley\n\nWe'll forget the sun in his jealous sky\n\nAs we lie in the fields of gold\n\n\n\nSee the west wind move like a lover so\n\nUpon the fields of barley\n\nFeel her body rise when you kiss her mouth\n\nAmong the fields of gold\n\nI never made promises lightly\n\nAnd there have been some that I've broken\n\nBut I swear in the days still left\n\nWe'll walk in the fields of gold\n\nWe'll walk in the fields of gold\n\n\n\nMany years have passed since those summer days\n\nAmong the fields of barley\n\nSee the children run as the sun goes down\n\nAmong the fields of gold\n\nYou'll remember me when the west wind moves\n\nUpon the fields of barley\n\nYou can tell the sun in his jealous sky\n\nWhen we walked in the fields of gold\n\nWhen we walked in the fields of gold\n\nWhen we walked in the fields of gold",
