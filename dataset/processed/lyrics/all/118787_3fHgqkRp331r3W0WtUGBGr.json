  "lyrics": "These fancy things in magazines\r\nDiamond rings and beauty queens\r\nBut nothing seems to sparkle like you do\r\nThese fancy cigars and caviar\r\nExpensive cars and movie stars\r\nBut everything I need is in this room\n\nOh, and I've seen the lights from New York to Vegas\n\nAnd I've tasted wine from Venice to Paris\n\nAnd I've seen the sights\n\nNothing can compare to you\n\n\n\nSo I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view\n\nMy search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you\n\nAnd the grass is always greener\n\n'Cause the sun shines when you smile\n\nAnd when I'm holding you the world makes sense\n\nOn my side of the fence\n\n\n\nIf I ever win the lottery\n\nIt wouldn't mean a lot to me, 'cause I already got you to hold my hand\n\nAnd if a genie gave me a million wishes\n\nI'd spend them all on all your kisses\n\nAnd save just one to stay right where I am\n\n\n\nSo I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view\n\nMy search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you\n\nAnd the grass is always greener\n\n'Cause the sun shines when you smile\n\nAnd when I'm holding you the world makes sense\n\nOn my side of the fence\n\n\n\nYou're the rain on the roof in the summer\n\nYou're the leaves in the fall changing color\n\nYou're the whisper I hear in the thunder\n\nOn my side of the fence\n\nYou're the reason my heart is beating faster\n\nYou're the tears falling down from the laughter\n\nYou're the only one I'm after\n\n\n\nSo I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view\n\nMy search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you\n\nAnd the grass is always greener\n\n'Cause the sun shines when you smile\n\nAnd when I'm holding you the world makes sense\n\nBaby, when I'm holding you the wold makes sense\n\nOn my side of the fence\n\nYou know it does, baby\n\nOn my side of the fence",
