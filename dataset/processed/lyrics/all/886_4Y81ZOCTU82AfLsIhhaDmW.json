  "lyrics": "The door is open to go through\r\nIf I could I would come too\r\nBut the path is made by you\r\nAs you're walking start singing and stop talking\r\nOh, if I could hear myself when I say\n\nOh, love is bigger than anything in its way\n\n\n\nSo young to be the words of your own song\n\nI know the rage in you is strong\n\nWrite a world where we can belong\n\nTo each other and sing it like no other\n\n\n\nOh, if I could hear myself when I say\n\nOh, love is bigger than anything in its way\n\n\n\nIf the moonlight caught you crying on Killiney Bay\n\nOh sing your song\n\nLet your song be sung\n\nIf you listen you can hear the silence say\n\nWhen you think you're done\n\nYou've just begun\n\n\n\nLove is bigger than anything in its way\n\nLove is bigger than anything in its way\n\nLove is bigger than anything in its way",
