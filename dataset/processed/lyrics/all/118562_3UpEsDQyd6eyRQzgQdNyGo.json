  "lyrics": "Some days are diamonds\r\nSome days are rocks\r\nSome doors are open\r\nSome roads are blocked\r\nSundowns are golden\n\nThen fade away\n\nBut if I never do nothing\n\nI'll get you back someday\n\n\n\nCause you got a heart so big\n\nIt could crush this town\n\nAnd I can't hold out forever\n\nEven walls fall down\n\n\n\nAnd all around your island\n\nThere's a barricade\n\nIt keeps out the danger\n\nIt holds in the pain\n\n\n\nSometimes you're happy\n\nSometimes you cry\n\nHalf of me ocean\n\nHalf of me sky\n\n\n\nBut you got a heart so big\n\nIt could crush this town\n\nAnd I can't hold out forever\n\nEven walls fall down\n\n\n\nAnd some things are over\n\nSome things go on\n\nAnd part of me you carry\n\nPart of me is gone\n\n\n\nBut you got a heart so big\n\nIt could crush this town\n\nAnd I can't hold out forever\n\nEven walls fall down\n\n\n\nBaby you got a heart so big\n\nIt could crush this town\n\nAnd I can't hold out forever\n\nEven walls fall down\n\nThey fall down",
