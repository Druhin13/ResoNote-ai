  "lyrics": "Days can be counted by the money spent\r\nToday was just another, better left unsaid\r\nDays can be counted by the time 'til rent\r\nTomorrow's just another, like the one that comes next\r\nThe car to the highway that leads to the job\r\nAt the desk by the boss with the elegant watch\r\nThe tick of the clock and the tick of the clock\r\nMark the moments 'til the ticking stops\r\nBut over time, the expectations grow\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nDesk with the calendar, pull off a page\r\nToss it in the bin where you throw them away\r\nThink of all the things that you'd do with a raise\r\nYesterday's another today going to waste\r\nThe car to the highway that takes you back home\r\nTo the wife and the kids and the dog with the phone\r\nThe tick of the tick and the tick of the clock\r\nMark the moments 'til the ticking stops\r\nBut over time, the expectations grow\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nâ™ª\r\nBut over time, the expectations\r\nSick of themselves, become replaced with\r\nThe thing you hate, and always hated\r\nKnow what I mean, yeah?\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home\r\nPeople go to work and then people go home",
