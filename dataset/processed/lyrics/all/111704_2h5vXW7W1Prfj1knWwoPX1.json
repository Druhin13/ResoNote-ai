  "lyrics": "Another sunny afternoon\r\nTonight is the worried look that's on my face\r\nConnected through the years\r\nIt somehow took us both in separate ways\r\nWas on a day that time forgot\r\nAnother day that time forgot oh no oh no\n\nShould have held you till the storm went by\n\nBut we had nothing left to hang on to\n\nToo many words you said\n\nBut not the words connecting me to you\n\nJust another day that time forgot\n\nAnother day that time forgot oh no oh no\n\nThe two of us we both just let it lie\n\nDidn't see it leave\n\nDidn't even try\n\nI only knew that we were moving on\n\nSuddenly it's gone\n\nNever knowing why oh no oh no\n\nDon't have a reason I can give\n\nAt least not one that I can understand\n\nJust somehow disappeared\n\nIt slipped beneath the fingers of my hand\n\nWas on a day that time forgot\n\nAnother day that time forgot oh no oh no\n\nWe had it once but we just let it fall\n\nShould have held it close\n\nCould have had it all\n\nI'm thinking 'bout the life we could have made\n\nLost the one we had\n\nSomewhere along the way oh no oh no\n\nA woke up all alone again\n\nA half remembered dream inside my head\n\nYou took me through the day\n\nFollowed me at night into my bed\n\nWas on day that time forgot\n\nAnother day that time forgot oh no oh no\n\nOh no oh no...\n\n\n\n(Thanks to david for these lyrics)",
