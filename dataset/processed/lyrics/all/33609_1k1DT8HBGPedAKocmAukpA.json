  "lyrics": "People keep asking me why I do things that I do\r\nIn all of this measuring influence I forgot you\r\nYou and me hiding behind the Monhegan Motel\r\nYou told me things that nobody around me would tell\r\nThat was the summer that everyone touched me at once\r\nOne day they ignored me, the next, they were all down my pants\n\nBut you were in bed with me, safe, before anyone else\n\nYou opened beside me and held me when I needed help\n\nYou and me lying together at night, my hero\n\nYou've been inside me forever, Judy Blume\n\n\n\nI couldn't carry a tune but I thought I could sing\n\nAnd no-one had told me that thoughts were a good or bad thing\n\nBut I started noticing grown-ups would smile and cringe\n\nBut you taught me that you could say anything you could think\n\n\n\nI don't remember my friends from gymnastics class\n\nBut I remember when Deenie was at the school\n\nDance buddy feeling her up in the locker room\n\nMargaret, bored, counting hats in the synagogue\n\nDavey was stirring the tea that you wouldn't drink\n\nTony was watching his so-called friend shoplifting\n\nAll of them lived in my head, quietly whispering:\n\n\"You are not so strange\"\n\nI don't remember the details of seventh grade\n\nAll I remember is lying and being afraid\n\nBut I don't forget Katherine and Mike were going all the way\n\nSteph on the scale in the bathroom alone that day\n\nKaren pretending to puke so her dad would stay\n\nMargaret arguing with God while she masturbated\n\nAll of those stacked on my shelf like a love letter\n\nAll of those saying \"Amanda you know better\n\nYou are not to blame\n\nThe world's a viscous place\n\nSo go on and think how you want\n\nYou will not be alone in your thoughts\n\nWell you will but you won't in a way\n\n'Cos a girl thought it too in a book that the library bought\"\n\n\n\nPeople will keep asking me why I do things like I do\n\nAnd from now on I'll tell them Nick Cave and I'll talk about you\n\nJudy, I can't believe sometimes that I'm an adult\n\nAnd the girls like I was think that I have this shit figured out\n\nYou and me lying together at night in my room\n\nYou'll be inside them forever, Judy Blume",
