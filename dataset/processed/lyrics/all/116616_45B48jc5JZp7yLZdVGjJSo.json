  "lyrics": "The world's standin' still on the 405\r\nThe vampires ain't out on Mullholand Drive\r\nHeart breaker smiles everywhere you turn\r\nSome learn too fast, some crash and burn\r\nAnd the sun still shines all the time\n\nAnd the sky's still blue\n\nAnd the stars shine bright every night\n\nLike they used to\n\nOh, but it ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California without you\n\n\n\nAmerican girls with those golden tans\n\nRunning down their dreams buried in the sand\n\nStill bettin' it all on that Hollywood sign\n\nHell, even the losers get lucky sometimes\n\n\n\nAnd the sun still shines all the time\n\nAnd the sky's still blue\n\nAnd the stars shine bright every night\n\nLike they used to\n\nOh but it ain't California\n\nIt ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California without you\n\n\n\nSince you've been gone the music keeps on goin'\n\nWould've followed you to the great wide open\n\nMe and Mary Jane, yeah we shed some tears\n\nWe're both free fallin' without you here\n\n\n\nAnd the sun still shines all the time\n\nAnd the sky's still blue\n\nAnd the stars shine bright every night\n\nLike they used to\n\nOh but it ain't California\n\nIt ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California without you\n\n\n\n(The stars shine bright every night, just like they used to)\n\nIt ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California without you\n\n(The stars shine bright every night, just like they used to)\n\nIt ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California\n\nNo, it ain't California without you",
