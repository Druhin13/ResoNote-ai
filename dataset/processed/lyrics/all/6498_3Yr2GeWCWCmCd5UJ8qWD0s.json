Fuck no!\"\n\nNo, no, no, no, no. Fuck no!\n\n\n\nSo give us all your f*****s, all your n*****s, and your sp**s\n\nGive us all your Muslims, the so-called terrorists\n\nWe'll welcome 'em with open arms and put 'em in our mix\n\nWe're better off together now, embrace our difference\n\n\n\nRemember there is love!\n\nOur words can stop their guns\n\nForget the rednecks\n\nLiving in the past\n\nWe're never going back now, we've reached critical mass!\n\n\n\nAnd so…\n\nI’ll sing\n\n\n\nStand my ground\n\nWon’t let the bastards grind me down\n\nI’m bold, I’m strange\n\nWon’t let their fears make me afraid\n\nThere’s hope, they’ll change",
