  "lyrics": "Cheap boat, 6 pack of something light\r\nA fireball burning up a blue sky\r\nA Mercury 93, wasn't even half pass noon\r\nA first taste of freedom after high school\r\nBreaking hearts, curfews and mamma's rules\r\nI just laugh thinking 'bout all the shit we got into\n\nYeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose\n\n\n\nBut we did, and we miss\n\nHow it was when we were just kids\n\nLookin' back on the past\n\nWasn't much but it's what we had\n\nJust a couple buds and a good buzz is all it was\n\nBut that's what memories are made of\n\n\n\nIt's been so long since me and Katy first met\n\nWe lost touch as all of the years went\n\nFlying past, fading fast, wishing I could make her mine\n\nThere's some things, the same to take you right back\n\nI see her face every time I hear that\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd vinyl spinning, I'm in her arms in my mind\n\nYeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose, never lose\n\n\n\nBut we did, and we miss\n\nHow it was when we were just kids\n\nLookin' back on the past\n\nWasn't much but it's what we had\n\nJust a good buzz from a summer love was all it was\n\nYeah, that's what memories are made of\n\n\n\nYeah, those were the days we thought we'd never lose\n\n\n\nBut we did, and we miss\n\nHow it was when we were just kids\n\nLookin' back on the past\n\nWasn't much but it's what we had\n\nJust a couple buds and a good buzz was all it was\n\nYeah, a summer love was all it was\n\nBut that's what memories are made of",
