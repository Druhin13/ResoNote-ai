  "lyrics": "The mind is willing, but the flesh is stuck\r\nIn evolution’s lazy stride\r\nThe vision dies, the door is locked\r\nTime and again, the dream’s denied\r\nAbjure the somatic tether\n\nThat binds our world together\n\nConjure the flesh under will\n\n\n\nSpin, spin go the baryons\n\nRound and round, a ballet in stasis \n\nUnchanging they carry on\n\nLest chance and law start trading places\n\n\n\nAnd lysergic amino acids\n\nLevitate, free and placid\n\nElevate the woke of our physique\n\n\n\nA new wind howls through\n\nThe gallery of thoughts\n\nAthwart reality\n\nKernel panic\n\nErupts in synaptic galaxies\n\n\n\nWhen descending deep enough\n\nInto the heart of what we are\n\nOne soon discovers matter’s bluff\n\nStuff is made nothing at all\n\n\n\nA creature of habit is our universe \n\nProfound the terror of the atom,\n\nThe molecule, the cell\n\nWhen forced with change;\n\nTo desire it - perverse \n\nInvoking it – an inconceivable hell\n\nUntil being dies\n\nAnd becoming awakens\n\n\n\n\n\nA new wind howls through the\n\nGallery of thoughts\n\nAthwart reality\n\nKernel panic \n\nErupts in synaptic galaxies",
