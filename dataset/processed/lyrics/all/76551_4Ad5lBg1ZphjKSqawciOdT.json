  "lyrics": "The blood starts pumping, the mind's alert\r\nThe goal is in focus, time to work\r\nI've got raw nerves and a loss for words\r\nSo you better not knock, do not disturb\r\nMy heart palpitates insatiable\r\nFollow my nose, aimed at a place to go\n\nOn the path I'm a pack of jungle cats\n\nWho can hunt as long as the hunger lasts\n\nI'm looking for a yes and I hate resistance\n\nYou can break it down to the basic instincts\n\nNot gonna wait, better make it instant\n\nOr else stand back at a safer distance\n\n(Shhh) demons whispering\n\nA little idea telling me it's the thing\n\nSo I dive down deep to apply surprise\n\nLike a great white killing with lifeless eyes\n\nI might try to stop but I'm out of control\n\nAnd I'm not cooling off so now that you know\n\nDon't allow me to blow cause I doubt I can hold\n\nAnd I'm about to (ahhh)\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nYou better give it to me\n\nIt's the take down\n\nGive it to me, give it to me, give it to me\n\nI'll take you down\n\n\n\nDeep down inside you know you're wrong\n\nAh man, just relax, it's not that bad\n\nCause you took it too far and it's time to stop\n\n\n\nWait, take one minute to think\n\nYou gotta stay calm, you're on the brink\n\nOf disaster, pause and catch yourself\n\nLet's make some calls and get some help\n\nYou need to understand what a mess you're in\n\nBefore I notify your next of kin\n\nIt's not that bad, your life's a wreck\n\nAnd I came to serve the reality check\n\nYou think that you're slick and sliding by\n\nWhen you sit there sipping on cyanide\n\nWith the people in your life left high and dry\n\nAnd don't try to hide those lying eyes\n\nWhat do you know, I know you're wrong\n\nI know that it's bad and it can't go on\n\nWell what do you want me to do, admit it\n\nAdmit it, tell me that I'm right, forget it\n\nI'm out of here and if I burn a bridge (bleep) you\n\nI don't know if I'll return to this\n\nSee, It's too late to manipulate\n\nA twist of fate and a lucky break\n\nI am what I am, not a role I can act\n\nAnd there's no going back and you don't know the half\n\nSo if you want to judge and find a fault\n\nI'll bring this talk to a grinding halt\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]",
