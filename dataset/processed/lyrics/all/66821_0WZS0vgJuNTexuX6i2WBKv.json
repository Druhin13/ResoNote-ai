  "lyrics": "As I lay me down\nHeaven hear me now\nI'm lost without a cause\nAfter giving it my all\n\nWinter storms have come\n\nAnd darkened my sun\n\nAfter all that I've been through\n\nWho on earth can I turn to?\n\n\n\nI look to you\n\nI look to you\n\nAfter all my strength is gone\n\nIn you I can be strong\n\n\n\nI look to you\n\nI look to you\n\nAnd when melodies are gone\n\nIn you I hear a song, I look to you\n\n\n\nAbout to lose my breath\n\nThere's no more fighting left\n\nSinking to rise no more\n\nSearching for that open door\n\n\n\nAnd every road that I've taken\n\nLead to my regret\n\nAnd I don't know if I'm gonna make it\n\nNothing to do but lift my head\n\n\n\nI look to you\n\nI look to you\n\nAnd when all my strength is gone\n\nIn you I can be strong\n\n\n\nI look to you\n\nI look to you\n\nAnd when melodies are gone\n\nIn you I hear a song, I look to you",
