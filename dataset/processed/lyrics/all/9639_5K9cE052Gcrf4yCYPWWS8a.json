  "lyrics": "I don't think enough\r\nBefore I say too much\r\nI'm digging my own grave\r\nWith all the shit I say\r\nI keep my head high\r\nKinda like a lie\n\nI say I'm doing fine\n\nEven when I'm losing my mind\n\n\n\nStay here\n\nI know I love you but I need another year, oh\n\nI don't wanna drag you through it\n\nStay here\n\nI know I love you but I need another year, oh\n\nI don't wanna drag you through it\n\n\n\nI'm feeling nauseous\n\nI'll light a cigarette\n\nI don't want a diagnosis\n\nI don't want a name to call this\n\nAnd I'm unravelling\n\nAnd all I know for certain\n\nIs I'm not running toward the safest thing\n\n\n\nYou're sticking around but how can you stand it?\n\nI can't salvage your mind while I'm losing mine quick\n\nAnd nobody should have to deal with this\n\nBut I need ya, I don't wanna leave ya\n\n\n\nStay here\n\nI know I love you but I need another year\n\nI don't wanna drag you through it\n\nStay here\n\nI know I love you but I need another year\n\nI don't wanna drag you through it\n\n\n\nStay here\n\nI know I love you but I need another year\n\nI don't wanna drag you through it\n\nStay here\n\nI know I love you but I need another year\n\nI don't wanna drag you through it",
