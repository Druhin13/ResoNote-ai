  "lyrics": "In the basement of an empty house\r\nI slept on the floor like a vagrant\r\nI braved a Minnesota winter night\r\nAnd drove to a movie feeling lonely\r\nAnd as I thawed my heart out by the light\n\nOf the silver screen\n\nI was unaware that you were there\n\nIn the dark, a silhouette\n\nWas climbing up the stairs\n\n\n\nAnd what I thought\n\nIn the parking lot\n\nWas like, I just wanna know your name\n\nI drove away\n\nWith not much to say\n\nBut in my hand I held a paper bird\n\nAnd written on it were the words\n\nBe brave\n\n\n\nWildflower knew I wasn’t well\n\nBut on the kitchen floor I got better again\n\nI grabbed my keys and drove toward a star\n\nAnd there, I was understood for the first time in my life\n\n\n\nCause that’s when I was introduced to true\n\nSerendipity\n\nI knew it when\n\nYou showed up again\n\nIn the snow, I was always told\n\nYour heart is where you’re home\n\n\n\nAnd what I thought\n\nIn the coffee shop\n\nWas like, the last eight hours was a dream\n\nI drove away\n\nWith not much to say\n\nBut in my hand I held a paper bird\n\nAnd written on it were the words\n\n\n\nOk, I'll be brave\n\n\n\nAnd in my mind\n\nAfter all this time\n\nI think, ain't life beautiful and strange\n\nI’m blown away\n\nWith no words to say\n\nCause I, I’ll forever be amazed\n\nHow I learned the meaning of the phrase\n\nBe brave",
