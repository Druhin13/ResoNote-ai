  "lyrics": "I was drinking in the daylight\r\nI was looking for a way to tell you\r\nThat without you I don't feel right\r\nKilling myself just to understand you\r\nKilling myself just to understand you\n\nHolding up for you but you gave me no sign\n\nHolding up for you, am I wasting my time?\n\nYou know I don't regret when I said too much\n\nBut I'm hating myself when I come undone\n\n\n\nIt's a sad dream\n\nIt's a sad song\n\nTo remind me\n\nBut I'm singing along\n\nIt's a sad dream\n\nIt's a sad song\n\nTo remind me\n\nBut I'm singing along\n\n\n\nI'll make it easy for you, baby\n\nRemove myself from your equation\n\nI've been overthinking lately (I've been overthinking lately)\n\nI've been overthinking lately\n\n\n\nI need to chill myself, can we take a drive?\n\nKeeping it quiet in the middle of the night\n\nCome a little closer, put your hands on me\n\nYou know I lose my mind thinking of you in the backseat\n\n\n\nIt's a sad dream\n\nIt's a sad song\n\nTo remind me\n\nBut I'm singing along\n\nIt's a sad dream\n\nIt's a sad song\n\nTo remind me\n\nBut I'm singing along\n\n\n\nHow could I see you with anyone but me?\n\nHow could I see you with anyone but me?\n\nHow could I see you with anyone but me?\n\nHow could I see you with anyone?\n\n\n\nIt's a sad dream\n\nIt's a sad song\n\nTo remind me\n\nBut I'm singing along\n\nIt's a sad dream\n\nIt's a sad song\n\nTo remind me\n\nBut I'm singing along\n\n\n\nI can't help myself\n\nI can't help myself\n\nI can't help myself\n\nI can't help myself",
