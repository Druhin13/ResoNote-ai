  "lyrics": "You've been gone too long,\rYou've been gone much too long,\rBaby I'm telling you, you've been gone too long,\rNow I've got a guy loves to stay home at night,\rHe really knows how to treat me right,\rYou've been gone too long, you've been gone too long,\rBaby I'm telling you, you've been gone too long,\rNow, you went out with Ruth, well you know that's the truth,\rYou went out with Flo, and she ain't so slow\rOh, you've been gone too long, you've been gone too long,\rBaby I'm telling you, you've been gone too long,\rNow let me tell you baby, don't you push me around,\rJust you do yourself a favour and get out of town,\rYou've been gone too long, yes, you've been gone too long,\rBaby I'm telling you, you've been gone too long,\rYou've been gone too long, you've been gone much too long.",
