  "lyrics": "There was never any simple way\r\nTo leave this behind\r\nNever any words to say\r\nTo speed up the time\r\nPositive and moving t'ward\r\nA home we can't find\n\nI never meant to make it any harder\n\n\n\nWinter comes and it gets dark and the branches creak and moan\n\nStraighten up your shirt and head out on your own\n\nShake the little demons out of the corners of your mind\n\nWith you here I know we can go farther\n\n\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nThere's no way around it\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nYeah then we make it through\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nThere's no way around it\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nYeah then we make it through\n\n\n\nIt's pale in here and the floorboards creak, the ceiling reaches down\n\nStarted out a big, bright city, now it's a small town\n\nEvery one you never wanted to run into again\n\nIs sitting at this bar next to each other\n\n\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nThere's no way around it\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nYeah then we make it through\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nThere's no way around it\n\nWe all get lonely\n\nYeah then we make it through",
