  "lyrics": "I'll walk alone\r\nBut to tell you the truth, I'll be lonely\r\nI don't mind being lonely\r\nWhen my heart tells me you are lonely, too\r\nI'll walk alone\n\nThey'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather\n\nThere are dreams I must gather\n\nDreams we fashioned the night you held me tight\n\n\n\nI'll always be near you wherever you are each night\n\nIn every prayer\n\nIf you call I'll hear you, no matter how far\n\nJust close your eyes and I'll be there\n\n\n\nPlease walk alone\n\nAnd send your love and your kisses to guide me\n\nTill you're walking beside me\n\nI'll walk alone\n\n\n\nI'll always be near you wherever you are each night\n\nIn every prayer\n\nIf you call I'll hear you, no matter how far\n\nJust close your eyes and I'll be there\n\n\n\nPlease walk alone,\n\nAnd send your love and your kisses to guide me\n\nTill you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone\n\nI'll walk alone",
