  "lyrics": "The day that I met you girl\r\nI knew that it was something special\r\nBut I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)\r\nWe met through mutual friends and this is where the story and confusion begin\r\nCause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't\n\nThere go the police man knocking at my door\n\nDo I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat\n\nOr do I answer real confused like \"I don't know\"\n\nNow me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more\n\nShe kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored\n\nThere's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid\n\n\n\nGirl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me\n\nAnd when temptation calls, I never pick up\n\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young\n\nThis is more than a crush, I just might be in love\n\n\n\nA six year difference\n\nIs a ten year sentence\n\nAnd with the pigment on my skin, I don't want to be another statistic\n\nYou bring me joy, joy, joy, joy\n\nAnd you fill a void that was once missing\n\nAnd I can say I'm in love\n\n\n\nThere go the police man knocking at my door\n\nDo I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat\n\nOr do I answer real confused like \"I don't know\"\n\nNow me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more\n\nShe kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored\n\nThere's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid\n\n\n\nGirl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me\n\nAnd when temptation calls, I never pick up\n\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young\n\nThis is more than a crush, I just might be in love\n\n\n\nWhen you're 35, I'll be 41\n\nAnd when I'm 27, you'll be 21\n\nYo, this is dumb\n\nAnd when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run\n\nCause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb\n\nYou should find someone else\n\nI'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself\n\nAnd mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help\n\nCause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help\n\nSo when you mention \"hang,\" I'm thinking about a tree and a belt\n\nAnd I don't want no relation, shit no relation\n\nShip when my dick is longer than my intentions-\n\nSpan, it's gonna suck your shit\n\nIt's that kitchen fan\n\nIt splattered on me like my dick in my hand\n\nWhat? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off\n\nBecause I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off\n\nShe gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught\n\nThat's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds\n\nBut I found my wings, fuck\n\n(But you're too fucking young)\n\nI really like you\n\n(And when temptation calls, I never pick up\n\nAnd girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)\n\nFunny thing about this is\n\nBy the time you hear this, I'll be in the clear\n\nIt's T and Uncle Charlie\n\n(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoy I know that we could be more than just friends\n\nBut you're scared\n\nBoy I know\n\nWe could be more than just friends\n\nBut you're scared\n\nI know\n\nI know that there could be\n\nSomethin' for you and me\n\nWhat's your philosophy?\n\nYou're scared, scared\n\nAnd I exit and wait a while\n\n(Just say the word)\n\nSee the answers are all there\n\n(But I'm just too gone to see)\n\nYou and I are cut from different fiber\n\n(I wonder why, I wonder why girl)\n\nDon't be too material to see\n\n(But I'm just too gone to see)\n\nThis world is such a struggle just to be\n\nFuck em all baby it's just you and me\n\n\n\nBut you're too fuckin' young\n\nAnd girl I know that you're the one for me\n\nFuck\n\nCause you're too fuckin young\n\nAnd girl I know that you're the one for me\n\nAnd it hurts\n\nIt fuckin hurts\n\nCause you're too fuckin young\n\nAnd girl I know that you're the one\n\nThat you're the one\n\nFor me\n\nCause you're too fuckin young\n\nAnd girl I know that you're the one for me\n\nYeah\n\n(I rock)\n\n(I rock)\n\n(I rock)",
