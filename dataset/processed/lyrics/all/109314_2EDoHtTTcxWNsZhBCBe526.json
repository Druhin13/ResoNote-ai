  "lyrics": "Night-time walker, keep your distance\r\nStay away from us, stay where you are\r\nHistory repeats her story, awakened by the sounds of long before\r\nI don't wanna see you, I don't wanna believe you're here\r\nBut it's too hard not to when your songs I hear\n\nAnd all the sweet repeats that make her so beautiful\n\n\n\nMaybe it's alright and the world's not quite\n\nWhat you believed is now all upside down\n\nMaybe it's alright and the world's not quite\n\nWhat you believed is now all upside down\n\nUpside down, upside down, upside down, upside down\n\n\n\nA shattered silence into spinning\n\nThe panic as you learn, there was nothing here worth living\n\nHidden from this, an end, middle, beginning\n\nImprisoned to watch a play where strangers stare, forgiving\n\nI believe that you and I have slowly made it to our final goodbye\n\nAnd when they ask, we'll stray to omit\n\nOnly truly knowing that this us was how we want it\n\n\n\nMaybe it's alright and the world's not quite\n\nWhat you believed, it's now all upside down\n\nGo on, here in the sound I drowned, our nerves broke down\n\nWhat you believed is now all upside down\n\n\n\nShe is sailing safely inside my head while we lay in comforts of our own bed\n\nIt'll be alright, it'll be alright\n\nHere, playing dead\n\nShe's sailing safely inside my head while we lay in the comforts of our own bed\n\nIt will be alright, we'll be alright\n\nHere, playing dead\n\n\n\nShe's sailing safely inside my head while we lay in the comforts of our own bed\n\nIt'll be alright, we'll alright\n\nHere, playing dead\n\nShe's sailing safely inside my head while we lay in the comforts of our own bed\n\nIt'll be alright, we'll be alright\n\nHere, playing dead\n\n\n\nMaybe its alright to turn it upside down and start things over\n\nMaybe its my time to turn it upside down and start things over",
