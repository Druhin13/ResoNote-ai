  "lyrics": "Waking up in a bright white room\r\nI've never seen it look so simple, oh yeah\r\nI wanna waste away my whole day with you\r\nBuried underneath these pillows\r\nSunday morning let's just stay\n\nIn bed and talk all day\n\nParadise in my apartment\n\nRain is falling down\n\nCan't get this smile off my face\n\nThink I need to tell you something\n\n\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI think I'm in love\n\nIn love again\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI think I'm in love\n\nIn love again\n\n\n\n(In love again)\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nDancing round the room like we're good\n\nAnd spilling champagne on the sofa, oh yeah\n\nI got your body pinned against my fridge\n\nIt's like the whole world stops when I hold ya\n\n\n\nSunday morning let's just stay\n\nIn bed and talk all day\n\nParadise in my apartment\n\nRain is falling down\n\nCan't get this smile off my face\n\nThink I need to tell you something\n\n\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI think I'm in love\n\nIn love again\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI think I'm in love\n\nIn love again\n\n\n\nIn my mind, in my head\n\nThere's an angel in my bed\n\nWe can fly, fly away\n\nIn my mind, in my head\n\nThere's an angel in my bed\n\nWe can fly, fly away\n\n\n\n(Baby we can fly)\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI think I'm in love\n\nIn love again\n\nLook what you've done\n\nI think I'm in love\n\nIn love again",
