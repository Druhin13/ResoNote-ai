  "lyrics": "The first snow\r\nThe first winter of my life\r\nI was told it was the height of me\r\nThe first dance\r\nWell, the first one that counted\r\nFelt like my blood was built my from crackling lights\n\n\n\nOh this ancient wildness\n\nThat we don't understand\n\nThe first sound of a heartbeat\n\nTo riot roaring on\n\n\n\nThis is not love you had before\n\nThis is something else\n\nThis is something else\n\nThis is not the same as other days\n\nThis is something else\n\nThis is something else\n\n\n\nShouldn't need to be so fucking hard\n\nThis is life on earth\n\nIt's just life on earth\n\nIt doesn't need to be the end of you, or me\n\nThis is life on earth\n\nIt's just life on earth\n\n\n\nThe first light\n\nThe first light on the silent shore\n\nJust the ships set anchor me and you\n\nThe way home\n\nThis is always the way home\n\nSo you can rip that map to shreds, my dear\n\n\n\nBut all we ever wanted\n\nSeems miles and miles from here\n\nIn the first days in a strange new land\n\nWe could be sailors\n\n\n\nThis is not love you had before\n\nThis is something else\n\nThis is something else\n\nThis is not the same as other days\n\nThis is something else\n\nThis is something else\n\n\n\nShouldn't need to be so fucking hard\n\nThis is life on earth\n\nIt's just life on earth\n\nIt doesn't need to be the end of you, or me\n\nThis is life on earth\n\nIt's just life on earth\n\n\n\nShouldn't need to be so fucking hard\n\nThis is life on earth\n\nIt's just life on earth\n\nIt doesn't need to be the end of you, or me\n\nThis is life on earth\n\nIt's just life on earth",
