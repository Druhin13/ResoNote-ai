  "lyrics": "Let's go back to the summer night\r\nWhen we met eyes, it’s like a movie line\r\nKissin' underneath the city lights\r\nBut now you're laying in another guy’s arms\r\n'Cause I'm all gone\n\nBut when you look in his eyes\n\nDo you think of mine?\n\nAnd when you look at that smile\n\nDo I cross your mind?\n\nI know in your head\n\nYou see me instead\n\n'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then\n\nBaby don't lie\n\nHe's just a lookalike\n\n\n\nCan't redo what's already done\n\nCan’t compete ’cause I've already won\n\nSayin’ this time, \"It's really love\"\n\nBut honey, you're not fooling anyone\n\nDon't you know we’re done?\n\n\n\nBut when you look in his eyes\n\nDo you think of mine?\n\nAnd when you look at that smile\n\nDo I cross your mind?\n\nI know in your head\n\nYou see me instead\n\n'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then\n\nBaby don't lie\n\nHe's just a lookalike\n\n\n\nAnd I'll admit that I sometimes, maybe, might\n\nThink about you at night, well, almost every night\n\nNo matter how I try to hide\n\nAnd erase you from my mind\n\nI'm dying\n\nTo find a lookalike\n\n\n\n'Cause when you look in his eyes\n\nHope you think of mine\n\nAnd when you look at that smile\n\nHope I cross your mind\n\nI hope in your head\n\nYou see me instead\n\n'Cause you've been in mine every day since then\n\nMaybe it's time to find a lookalike\n\n\n\nNo, I can't lie\n\nI need a lookalike",
