  "lyrics": "I'm staring down a stream of sweet impressions\r\nI'm waiting just to sense that special presence\r\nI feel I wanna need somebody\r\nAnd they can say I'm fine\r\nThere's nothing wrong with me\n\nSomebody sees\n\nDon't you believe me, honey?\n\n\n\nI crawled up on the stage and felt so sleazy\n\nBut when I saw their faces it came easy\n\nIt freed me\n\nBelieve you me\n\n\n\nAnd if you're gonna love somebody\n\nYou gotta lose some pride\n\nBut you can't be part of somebody else\n\nDidn't they tell you, honey?\n\nAlright\n\n\n\nJust like you said about your old boyfriend\n\nAnd how he screamed his wasted song to the wind\n\n\n\nAnd also, you were talking about the teenage mom\n\nThe cellar stairs that she was crying upon\n\n\n\nSaid you could tell me about a pissed-off kid\n\nOh and I'm sure he'll be ashamed what he did\n\n\n\nI'm even feeling for his desperate and doped-out dad\n\nSo dumb he doesn't know when he's feeling bad\n\n\n\nMy friend he told me that I can't depend\n\nOn anything that doesn't come from within\n\nOh but my God, how am I ever gonna help the world\n\nWhen I can't even heal the heart of my girl?\n\n\n\nI got a need that I just can't see through\n\nI gotta guess that I'm exactly like you\n\nAnd more and more I get a tightness 'bout right here in my chest\n\nYou lie in bed all day just getting depressed\n\n\n\nOh it's so bad I wanna break that wall\n\nThat always seems to cut me off from you all\n\nOh but I guess I should accept the way the world, as it stands\n\nIt's spinning totally outside of my hands\n\nLost in the stars, that are singing their light\n\nAcross a hundred million miles\n\n\n\nAnd if you're gonna love somebody\n\nYou gotta lose some pride\n\nBut you can't be part of somebody else\n\nDidn't they tell you, honey?\n\n\n\nAnd if you're gonna love somebody\n\nYou gotta lose some pride\n\nBut you can't be part of somebody else\n\nDidn't they tell you, honey?\n\n\n\nYou gotta love somebody\n\nYou gotta love somebody\n\nBut you can't be part of somebody else\n\nDidn't they tell you, honey?",
