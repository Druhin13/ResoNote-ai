  "lyrics": "Losing light, and closer than I’ve ever been\r\nTo paralyzed and covered in your fingerprints\r\nPulses beating right in time\r\nMotion for a silent night\r\nHolding tight, closer than I’ve ever been\n\nI can’t escape\n\nI’m living with the ghost magnetic\n\nYeah all that I can hear them say\n\nIs I’m the whisper of a dead aesthetic\n\nYeah all I need to take me home\n\nIs somebody that could save my soul\n\nBut I never seem to find my way\n\nFrom living with the ghost magnetic\n\n\n\nI’m baptized every time you say to me\n\nTo close my eyes; your touch becomes my everything\n\nDancin’ ’til we disappear\n\nTo voices in the chandeliers\n\nHolding tight to the monster right in front of me\n\n\n\nI can’t escape\n\nI’m living with the ghost magnetic\n\nYeah all that I can hear them say\n\nIs I’m the whisper of a dead aesthetic\n\nYeah all I need to take me home\n\nIs somebody that could save my soul\n\nBut I never seem to find my way\n\nFrom living with the ghost magnetic\n\n\n\nWe bring our souls in close\n\nFor a toast to the afterlife, oh\n\nWe hold our breath, no regret\n\nDead set on the dead inside\n\nI’m baptized every time you say to me\n\n\n\nI can’t escape\n\nI’m living with the ghost magnetic\n\nYeah all that I can hear them say\n\nIs I’m the whisper of a dead aesthetic\n\nYeah all I need to take me home\n\nIs somebody that could save my soul\n\nBut I never seem to find my way\n\nFrom living with the ghost magnetic\n\n\n\n(I can’t escape)\n\n(I can’t escape)",
