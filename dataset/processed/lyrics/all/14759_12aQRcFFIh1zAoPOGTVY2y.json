  "lyrics": "When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold\r\nWhen they break it down and this world is all you know\r\nHands up, you're working it 'round\r\nNow get yourself together\r\nWhen you count the dominos fall, it's time to go\n\nNow I'm feeling so far away\n\nI see the colors and all the kids going home\n\nNight is crawling into the day\n\nI hear my voice ringing\n\nThe summertime's singing\n\n\n\nJust wanna stay up all night with you\n\nJust wanna stay up all night with you\n\nThere's nothing that I wouldn't rather do\n\nJust wanna stay up all night with you\n\n\n\nI'll keep it moving\n\nDon't wait for nothing now\n\nGotta keep it moving\n\nDon't wait for nothing now\n\nI'll keep it moving\n\nDon't wait, don't wait for nothing now\n\nGotta keep it moving\n\nDon't wait for nothing now, nothing now\n\n\n\n1, 2, what you doing?\n\nI've been jumping through some hoops\n\nWanna get my body loose\n\nWanna tell you, tell you what to do\n\nI've been running out of breath like an animal struggling\n\nLooking for a diamond\n\nI'm trying, I'm fighting\n\nBack into the rhythm now\n\n\n\nI just wanna stay up all night\n\nWanna stay up all night with you\n\nWith you, you\n\n\n\nJust wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)\n\nJust wanna stay up all night with you\n\nThere's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)\n\nJust wanna stay up all night with you\n\n\n\nLiving up in the air\n\nIf you don't really care\n\nLiving don't get you there\n\nIf you got the time to take it up there\n\nLiving up in the air\n\nLiving out on a prayer\n\nLiving don't get you there\n\nIf you got the time to take it up there\n\n\n\nLiving up in the air\n\nIf you don't really care\n\nLiving don't get you there\n\nIf you got the time to take it up there\n\nUp all night with you, with you",
