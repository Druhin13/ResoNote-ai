  "lyrics": "As we gather round this table\r\nWe remember and proclaim\r\nChrist has died, Christ is risen\r\nChrist will come again\r\nThere's nothing to fear and everything to gain\r\nAnd so we gather here to remember\n\nTo remember and proclaim\n\n\n\nEvery footstep tells the story\n\nAs the people join the feast\n\nWe remember his blood and body\n\nBroken for you and me\n\nOne step and we remember\n\nThe other we proclaim\n\nHis death until He comes\n\nO He's coming back\n\nHe's coming back again!\n\n\n\nAnd every time we break the bread\n\nWe drink the wine,\n\nI can hear the song in my heart and my head,\n\nAnd I sing along...\n\nWe remember, we proclaim\n\nHis death until he comes again!\n\nWe remember, we proclaim\n\nChrist has died, Christ has risen,\n\nChrist will come again!\n\n\n\nNow we join with friends and neighbors\n\nTo celebrate again\n\nAround a different kind of table\n\nWe remember just the same.\n\nThis feast, it is a battle\n\nThat we wage against the night,\n\nThis joy is just a shadow of the resurrection\n\nOf the resurrection life!\n\n\n\nAnd every time we break the bread,\n\nWe drink the wine,\n\nI can hear the song in my heart and my head,\n\nAnd I sing along...\n\nWe remember, we proclaim\n\nHis death until he comes again!\n\nWe remember, we proclaim:\n\nChrist has died, Christ has risen,\n\nChrist will come again!\n\n\n\nWe remember, we proclaim\n\nHis death until he comes again!\n\nWe remember, we proclaim\n\nChrist has died, Christ has risen,\n\nChrist will come again!",
