  "lyrics": "They smell like smoke from the night before\r\nRough and ragged, dusty and worn\r\nEmpty pockets coming apart at the seams,\r\nI guess you could say these jeans are a lot like me\r\nBeat down collar, rolled up sleeves,\n\nPocket scarred from a skoal can ring,\n\nIt ain't afraid of a little sweat, it was made to never quit\n\nThis shirt and me we've gotta a common thread\n\n\n\nSo why would I change something that feels so good to me?\n\nWhatever life brings you can bet I'm going to be the same\n\nThat's what I am all the way till the day that I die,\n\nWhy would I change?\n\n\n\nI'm not every woman's dream\n\nBut then again I never tried to be,\n\nI'm just a man not a saint,\n\nI'll never be what I ain't,\n\nAnd she likes me that way...\n\n\n\nSo why would I change something that feels so good to me?\n\nWhatever life brings you can bet I'm going to be the same\n\nThat's what I am all the way till the day that I die,\n\nWhy would I change?\n\n\n\nThe sun sets in the west\n\nAnd the mountains never move\n\nNo one could ever love me the way that you do\n\n\n\nWhy would I change something that feels so good to me?\n\nWhatever life brings you can bet I'm going to be the same\n\nThat's what I am all the way till the day that I die,\n\nWhy would I...\n\nThat's what I am all the way till the day that I die,\n\nWhy would I change?",
