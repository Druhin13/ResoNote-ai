  "lyrics": "I been hiding something good\r\nSomething that I want you to find\r\nYou know I never keep nothing from you\r\nTell you every little thing that I do\r\nSending you my thoughts for years\r\nSometimes they make you cry\n\nBut I finally found a way to get myself inside of your head\n\n\n\nI feel together in a wasted mind\n\nI heard a rumor there was nothing to find out\n\nSaw angels in dimensions not far away\n\nBut they're fleeting away again\n\nI tried to tell you but I ran out of time\n\nI found myself between a rock and a hard place\n\nFollowing strangers up to high rise apartments\n\nWhen I don't even need the view\n\nI don't need it at all\n\n\n\nA temporary case of the blues\n\nAt least I've got something to do\n\nI'm shipping shirts out in boxes\n\nTo someone as mysterious as you\n\nI love it that the road never ends\n\nSitting around, making records with friends\n\nAnd hustling through cities but we never even really arrive\n\n\n\nI feel together in a wasted mind\n\nI heard a rumor there was nothing to find out\n\nSaw angels in dimensions not far away\n\nBut they're fleeting away again\n\nI tried to tell you but I ran out of time\n\nI found myself between a rock and a hard place\n\nFollowing strangers up to high rise apartments\n\nWhen I don't even need the view\n\nI don't need it at all\n\n\n\nWasted mind, wasted time\n\nWasted mind, wasted time\n\nWasted mind, wasted time\n\nWasted mind, wasted time\n\nWasted",
