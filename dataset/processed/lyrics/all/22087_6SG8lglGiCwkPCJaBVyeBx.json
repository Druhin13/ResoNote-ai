  "lyrics": "I'm a living sunset\r\nLightning in my bones\r\nPush me to the edge\r\nBut my will is stone\r\n'cause I believe in a better way\n\n\n\nFools will be fools\n\nAnd wise will be wise\n\nBut i will look this world\n\nStraight in the eyes\n\n\n\n'cause I believe there's a better way\n\nI believe in a better way\n\n\n\nWhat good is a man\n\nWho won't take a stand\n\nWhat good is a cynic\n\nWith no better plan\n\n\n\nI believe in a better way\n\nI believe in a better way\n\n\n\n(hope these words feel pleasant\n\nAs they rest upon your ears)\n\n\n\nReality is sharp\n\nIt cuts at me like a knife\n\nEveryone i know\n\nIs in the fight of their life\n\n\n\nAnd I believe there's a better way\n\n\n\nTake your face out of your hands\n\nAnd clear your eyes\n\nYou have a right to your dreams\n\nAnd don't be denied\n\n\n\nI believe in a better way",
