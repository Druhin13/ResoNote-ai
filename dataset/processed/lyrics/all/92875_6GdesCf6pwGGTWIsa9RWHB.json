  "lyrics": "When the darkness looked away\r\nAnd the stars don't frown on me\r\nWhen the fire's burning blue through you\r\nWe're alive inside a flame\r\nAnd the night's a brighter shade\r\nWhen the fire's burning blue through you\n\n\n\nPlease, let me drown\n\nPlease, let me drown\n\n\n\nPool emotes without color\n\nIt knows the sea is dark there\n\nWithout light, it knows the fire, they can't find it\n\n\n\nWhen the tide pulls away\n\nNot the one you need to save\n\nAll the lies, they were coming true with you\n\n\n\nSo please, let me drown\n\nPlease, let me drown\n\n\n\nFeeling alight in my shoes\n\nFeeling alight on my feet\n\nFeeling alight in my shoes\n\nLight the fire, oh, light the flame\n\nLight the fire, oh, light the flame\n\nFeeling alight on my feet\n\nLight the fire, oh, light the flame\n\nLight the fire, oh, light the flame",
