  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Dancing Alone par Axwell Î› Ingrosso\r\nShe's shining in a sea of people, see her smiling\nSomething about her body caught my eyes and\nI can't seem to look away\nOh, she's floating\nBumping into strangers like they're nothing\nActing like she know she's hiding something, yeah\nI can't take my eyes away, no\n\nIt's like I've seen her face before\nI know, but I don't know for sure\nMy friends ain't with me anymore\nOh, I've gotta know\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nDid she come on her own?\n\nSeem so lost\nSo why does she keep on dancing\nDancing alone?\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nDid she come on her own?\nSeem so lost\nSo why does she keep on dancing\nDancing alone?\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\n\nShe's hiding, I'm looking for her everywhere\nI'm trying to spot her like a pin drop in the silence, yeah\nI can't let her get away, no\n\nSomeone's behind me\nWe go back to back and we're colliding\nSuddenly I turned around and right there\nShe's staring back at me\n\nIt's like I've seen her face before\nI know, but I don't know for sure\nMy friends ain't with me anymore\nOh, I've gotta know\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nDid she come on her own?\nSeem so lost\nSo why does she keep on dancing\nDancing alone?\n\nWhy she dancing alone\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nDid she come on her own?\nSeem so lost\nSo why does she keep on dancing\nDancing alone?\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone\n\nWhy she dancing alone\nWhy she dancing alone",
