  "lyrics": "You never know just what you've got\r\nTill it's slippin' through your fingers\r\nNever know just what you've got\r\nTill it's gone with the wind\r\nAnd you never miss your shadow\r\nTill there's no one left beside you\n\nYou never miss your shadow\n\nTill you're all alone in the dark\n\n\n\nYou never know just what will break you\n\nTill you're picking up the pieces\n\nNever know just what will break you\n\nTill your world falls apart\n\nNever know how small your voice is\n\nTill you're screaming out the silence\n\nNever know how small your voice is\n\nTill you're arguing, arguing with God\n\n\n\nI saw Death's face today\n\nAs he led my friend away\n\nI saw Death's face today\n\nAs he cast his shadow over me\n\nI saw Death's face today\n\nAs he led my friend away\n\nSo I'll ask who I gotta pay\n\nTo bring him back\n\nBring him back to me\n\nBring him back to me\n\n\n\nYou never know the words you should've said\n\nUntil they're all that you left with\n\nUntil the dirt is falling and the guilt it burns your bones\n\nAnd we ask the biggest question\n\nWhy the fuck did this all happen?\n\nWho on Earth deserves this and what the hell do we do now?\n\nSo we live like we have lost\n\nAnd we love like we are broken\n\nAnd as the color leaves the sky we're left in reverence\n\nOf the frailty of it all",
