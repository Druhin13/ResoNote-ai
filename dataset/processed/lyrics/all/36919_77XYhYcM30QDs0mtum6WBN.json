  "lyrics": "Saw your page, lovely new life\r\nLots of likes, lovely new wife\r\nOn my phone, you're in my home\r\nI'm on my own, in monochrome\r\nI wanna put you behind me, I wanna put you to bed\n\nWait, what was I thinking?\n\nOh what have I said?\n\nIs that me or Freud talking?\n\nOr me on wine?\n\nI shouldn't be clicking\n\nOn your new Valentine\n\nI shouldn't be lurking, but look here I am\n\n\n\nGiving into temptation, not giving a damn\n\nIf I just keep refreshing, maybe you'll disappear\n\nIf I just make you jealous, then you'll wish you were here\n\nBaby look at the time now, I should just go to bed\n\nIt's send or delete now, on all that I've said\n\nI'm closing your page now, are you looking at mine\n\n\n\nDo you scroll through my photos\n\nJust to check that I'm fine\n\nWith a casual disinterest\n\nOr a trace of regret\n\nOr stabbed through your heart\n\nWhen you think how we met\n\nIf I just knew for certain\n\nThat you weren't having fun\n\nI could bring down the curtain\n\nIt would prove that I won\n\n\n\nBut your face is in my face\n\nAnd you're all over the place\n\nI'm lost without a trace\n\nAnd your face is in my face\n\nI wish you'd vanish without a trace\n\nBut your life is all over the place\n\nAnd your face is in my face\n\nYour face is in my face\n\nIt's in my face\n\nIn my face\n\nIn my face, oh",
