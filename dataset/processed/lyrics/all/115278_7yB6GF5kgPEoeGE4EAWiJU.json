I see three\n\nThe bitch started to panic so I made her switch seats\n\nDrivin' now, police chopper ahead flyin' now\n\nReally not too spooked, calmly asked me, \"Am I dyin' now?\"\n\nAll I know is keep you calm and collected\n\nCrackin' jokes like, \"Nigga, now you gon' be finally respected\"\n\nSee your blood leakin', got my foot on this gas\n\nTossed the .40, we pull up to Daniel free and see CRASH\n\nYou know the alibi, they started shootin', we was standin' by\n\nAin't see nothing, but the flare from the talons fly\n\n\"I wasn't there, I was passin' by\"\n\nMatter fact, don't say shit, I'm just gon' drop you in the back and slide\n\nThat's yo weed, all the cash is mine\n\nI took 'em both to the spot plus your phone til you back online\n\n\n\nOh baby it's been soo long, oohh\n\nOh baby it's been soo long, oohh",
