  "lyrics": "It was a Sunday morning when the mail ain't supposed to come\r\nA big blue box delivered, and it didn't say where from\r\nWhen a wind up man emerges and he waltzed across the floor\r\nTold him I was lonesome, said I wouldn't be no more\r\nHis left hand made me breakfast and his right one paid the bills\n\nPoured a perfect cocktail and he always kept it filled\n\nI don't know how he do the things he do with those two hands\n\nI knew I'd wind up loving him, my loving wind up man\n\n\n\nThey say machines ain't made for loving\n\nBut I believe that they can plug in to your heart\n\nAnd you know when it starts\n\nIn the smoke, in the sparks\n\nYou're not broke\n\nIt's all part of a lover's game\n\n\n\nHe always called me handsome and he smiled when I spoke\n\nDressed like Elvis Presley and he laughed at all my jokes\n\nWas my love until the day he caught the rain unplanned\n\nKnew I'd wind up losing him, my loving wind up man\n\n\n\nThey say machines ain't made for loving\n\nBut I believe that they can plug in to your heart\n\nAnd you know it begins\n\nWhen it whirs and it spins\n\nIt don't hurt, it's not a sin\n\nNo one to blame\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom\n\n\n\nAnd I heard him holler, he began to fire and spark\n\nSmoking from his collar and his smiling eyes went dark\n\nNever will forget him and the smell of all that smoke\n\nKnew I'd wind up loving him until he wound up broke\n\n\n\nThey say machines ain't made for loving\n\nBut I believe that they can plug in to your heart\n\nTry in vain to protect\n\nWhen it rains he'll get wet\n\nJust keep training to expect\n\nFeeling all the pain\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom\n\n\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom\n\nBa dum bom, bom bom bom bom",
