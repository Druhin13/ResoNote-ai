  "lyrics": "You have to be comfortable with yourself because that's all there is\r\nYou and nature\r\nYou think you got it all figured out, you know, the wilderness will figure some way to teach you a lesson\r\nAs I'm alone in the forest I'm in one with my surroundings and there's a lot of peace in that solitude\r\nI obey my command\n\n(Living off the land)\n\nAnd I break my back\n\nAnd I work all night\n\nAt times I do all their work too\n\nIt don't break my stride\n\nI just keep moving forward\n\nAt times I wish there was two\n\nSo I have somebody else that could help me help you\n\n\n\nI'll be down, sometimes it's hard to back up the bills on the credit card\n\nShe keeps on running to leave\n\nIf you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spend\n\nBut like her trust, you cannot get lit\n\nSunday, you go to church\n\nBack on your knees and you're tryna' soul search\n\n\n\nI'm just a man doing the best that I can\n\nSaint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan\n\nWhen you're living off the land\n\n\n\nWhy you waste what you ain't got\n\nOn that power box\n\nHas it not quite dawned on you, that don't work at all\n\nSee the easy thing to do\n\nIS the hardest thing to do\n\nYou just open yourself up\n\nSo the truth could come through\n\n\n\nI'll be down, sometimes it's hard to back up the bills on the credit card\n\nShe keeps on running to leave\n\nIf you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spend\n\nBut like her trust, you cannot get lit\n\nSunday, you go to church\n\nBack on your knees and you're tryna' soul search\n\n\n\nI'm just a man doing the best that I can\n\nSaint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan\n\nWhen you're living off the land\n\n\n\nLiving off the land\n\nLiving off the land\n\nLiving off the land\n\n\n\nI'll be down, sometimes it's hard to back up the bills on the credit card\n\nShe keeps on running to leave\n\nIf you don't get on your knees and repay the money you spend\n\nBut like her trust, you cannot get lit\n\nSunday, you go to church\n\nBack on your knees and you're tryna' soul search\n\n\n\nI'm just a man doing the best that I can\n\nSaint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan\n\nWhen you're living off the land\n\n\n\nLiving off the land\n\nLiving off the land\n\n\n\nI'm just a man doing the best that I can\n\nSaint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan\n\nWhen you're living off the land\n\n\n\nIf you just open yourself (If you just open yourself)\n\nIf you just open yourself (If you just open yourself)\n\nIf you just open yourself (If you just open yourself)\n\nYou'll see, that what you need\n\nWhen you're living off the land",
