  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Deep & The Dark par Visions of Atlantis\r\nShut the light, call the night, bring my safety back\nAre they gone, I hear none, as all fades to black\nBut your hands on my shoulder's calming me down\n\nBuild a wall, start a war, here they come for me\nGrab the sword, come on board, face my enemy\nBut you silence all their cries when you speak your loving words\n\nBe my sunrise\nRedemption lies in your eyes\n\nYou are my antidote\nWhen the waves of doubts rush in\nAs I drown in my memories\n\nThe darkness creeps in\n\nLosing faith on my battleground\nThe shadows leave their mark\nYour light brings me back from\nThe deep and the dark\n\nTake my hand, make a stand, and then hold your breath\nSee what comes, see what runs, in the face of death\nHow is it that you never seem to worry?\n\nIn the end, I must bend, and then hold or break\nKneel to pray, come what may, when my soul's at stake\nAnd you loosen all the knots with a smile on your face\n\n\nIn this rat race\nThe enemy wears my face\n\nYou are my antidote\nWhen the waves of doubts rush in\nAs I drown in my memories\nThe darkness creeps in\n\nLosing faith on my battleground\nThe shadows leave their mark\nYour light brings me back from\nThe deep and the dark\n\nCome take my hand, take my heart\nKeep me safe, keep me warm\nThey take my pride, take this life\nBut they won't take my soul\n\n\nYou are my antidote\nWhen the waves of doubts rush in\nAs I drown in my memories\nThe darkness creeps in\n\nLosing faith when I look around\nMadness leaves a mark\nBrings death to your doorway\nThe deep and the dark",
