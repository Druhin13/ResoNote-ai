  "lyrics": "A swollen tongue, a plastic gun\r\nRed burn from an orange sun\r\nThese oil rigs will crack and run\r\nThese palm trees will be chopped to a stump\r\nI've wandered, seen visions, I never could fit in\n\nI'm out there, you'll find me, I never lost that easy\n\n\n\nYou imitate, all night stay awake\n\nYou study ancient intelligence\n\nIt's a lonely life by candlelight\n\nTo make believe, you talk to the dead\n\n\n\nI've wandered, seen visions, I've gone off the deep end\n\nI'm out there, you'll find me, I never lost that easy\n\n\n\nMy drunken confession, sick in the bathtub\n\nWhile you take your make-up off\n\nYou take yourself so serious\n\nIf we didn't laugh, we're crying all the time\n\n\n\nNo matter where I've been, I never could fit in\n\nDon't worry where I'll be, I never lost that easy",
