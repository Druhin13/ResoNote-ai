Uh, I hear you talkin' (But)\n\nYou saying nothing (Ha)\n\nTell me, whats the message?\n\nWhat's up? Uh, I see you standing\n\nWith your back on the brick wall\n\nBut I know you wanna lift off\n\nWell here's your chance\n\nI'm likely the reason you might be\n\nMoving on the right league\n\nSweeter than icy\n\n\n\nNow it must be the season to get things clear\n\n'Cause ain't no wallflowers bloomin' round here\n\nSo get uprooted while you suit and boot it\n\nAnd if you decide to toot it, I will catch it like chair\n\nThrow it in the air like leer\n\nReceive no caution, nope, you ain't got fear\n\nThe sweetest melodies are in your ear\n\nWill lead you right into the land of funk\n\nGood God, it's milk and honey all around\n\nCaramel cream and chocolate brown\n\nFound my way up heavens high\n\nAnd I don't really think I can come back down\n\n\n\nNow, what's up? What's up?\n\nCook it up, you a good cook, good cook\n\nPull it out the oven, too hot, drop back\n\nJump back on your good foot, good foot\n\nWhere the hook at?\n\n\n\nI don't know what you came to do\n\n(I don't know what you came here for)\n\nBut I came here to get busy (1, 2, 3, 4, say)\n\nI don't know what you came to do\n\n(I really don't understand)\n\nBut I came here to get down, down, down\n\nI came to get down, down, down\n\n(One more time, say)\n\nI don't know what you came to do\n\n(I just really don't know)\n\nBut I came here to get busy\n\n(That's exactly what I came here for)\n\nI don't know what you came to do\n\n(I really don't know)\n\nBut I came here to get down, down, down\n\nI came to get down, down, down\n\n\n\nI just walked up in the door\n\n(I just walked up in this thing looking good)\n\nYou were movin' on the floor\n\n(I swear you was moving like a concrete wall, baby)\n\nHop up on your good foot\n\n(Act like your left foot broken or something now)\n\nWhatchu playin' for?\n\n(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n\n\nSay, what's up? What's up?\n\nCook it up, you a good cook, good cook\n\nPull it out the oven, too hot, drop back\n\nJump back on your good foot, good foot\n\nBring it back now\n\nWhat's up? What's up?\n\nCook it up, you a good cook, good cook\n\nPull it out the oven, too hot, drop back\n\nJump back on your good foot, good foot\n\n\n\nOn ya good foot\n\nOn ya good foot\n\nGet on the good foot\n\nOn the good foot\n\nOn the good foot, woo\n\nGet on the good foot",
