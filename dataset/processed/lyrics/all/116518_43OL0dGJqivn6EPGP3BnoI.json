I repeat, should I go blind?\n\nCopy\n\n[?] to break one, we got authority to run code blind\n\nI repeat, we got authority to run code blind\n\nInitiating sequence\n\n\n\nHuh\n\nOverlookin' over [?]\n\nMe and private dancer\n\nMy range like Jon Stark she walk through the castle like Sansa\n\nLike [?], I took major chances to land us in this position\n\nWhere the engine mounted in the back of us\n\nThe streets chatter of us coming up\n\nIt's like they glad to see the gladiators paper'd up\n\nIt was a prophecy fulfilled now raise your glasses up\n\nThey chill properly and [?] to the store until an occasion to roll\n\nCelebrate we get dough, another open door\n\nAnother closed, another mil', another deal\n\nAnd once that ink dry, you worth upwards of twenty mil'\n\nAnd in the blink of an eye, you're who them bitches feel\n\nThis shit is really real\n\nMatter of fact this shit is really ill\n\nBut I wouldn't chose another lifestyle still\n\n[?] gears go up here\n\nI got a stupid ass crib up there, I stay here\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nSir, [?]\n\nYeah he just turned in South\n\nNow he's goin' into the [?]\n\nYeah\n\nStraight in\n\nYeah, and he got uh 3.. got a whole bunch of people on the beach waitin' for him\n\n[?]\n\nThey're unloading fuel barrels\n\nYeah they're unloading the barrels\n\nAll the barrels have been unloaded",
