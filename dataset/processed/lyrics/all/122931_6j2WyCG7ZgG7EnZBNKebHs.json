  "lyrics": "Mary's Boy Child, Jesus Christ was born on Christmas Day And man will live for evermore because of Christmas Day Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say Mary's Boy Child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day) Hark now hear the angels sing, a king was born today And man will live for evermore because of Christmas Day (Mary's Boy Child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day While shepherds watched their flocks by night They see a bright new shining star They hear a choir sing a song The music seemed to come from afar Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today And man will live for evermore because of Christmas Day Hm ..... For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out There were tears of joy and laughter People shouted let ev'ryone know There is hope for all to find peace And then they found a little nook in a stable all forlorn And in a manger cold and dark Mary's little boy was born Hark now hear the angels sing a king was born today And man will live for evermore because of Christmas day (Mary's Boy Child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas day) For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out There were tears of joy and laughter People shouted let ev'ryone know There is hope for all to find peace Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us And love may reign once more Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found him Oh my Lord, a golden halo crowned him Oh my Lord, they gathered all around him To see him and adore Oh my Lord (well praise the Lord) They had begun to doubt you Oh my Lord (he is the truth forever) What did they know about you Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord) But they were lost without you They needed you so bad (his light is shining on us) Oh my Lord (oh my Lord so praise the Lord) With the child's adoration Oh my Lord (oh my Lord, he is a personation) There came great jubilation Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord) And full of admiration They realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky) Oh my Lord, you sent your son to save us Oh my Lord, your very self you gave us Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us And love may reign once more",
