  "lyrics": "Heist in broad day light\r\nShattered the glass\r\nPopped the wheelie on the motorbike\r\nThese hoes was out of sight\r\nMy hitters were close by\r\nYour shooters was no-shows\n\nNow your hands been exposed\n\nWe know what you want bro\n\nWater in the lawn\n\nJust [?] sharks in the polo bro\n\nTerror claw, tinder [?]\n\nPlaying fetch with my dogs\n\nDoing what i say i do in my music\n\nOne of the truest\n\nWord to see murder, made the law see murder\n\nPull up in the newest\n\nClouds are the loudest\n\nComing out when i open the door\n\nIts like a smoke bomb exploded\n\nNot worried about a bitch though\n\nIts just how much weight that bitch hold\n\nIs your name ringing in the strip club\n\nCan you bring us more hoes\n\nTryna have the flighest horses anyone ever rode\n\nIn the stable ran in the race to bring the prize money home",
