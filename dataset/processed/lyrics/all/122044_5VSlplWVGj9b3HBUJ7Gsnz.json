  "lyrics": "If my memory serves me right\r\nI would tuck you in almost every night\r\nSaying, \"Sweet dreams\" and \"Good night\"\r\nRight before I turned off all the lights\r\nBut sweet dreams can turn into nightmares\n\nWhen our heroes are no longer out there\n\n\n\nI'm sorry to say that the smiles that I give you\n\nOne day will be tears in your eyes\n\nI'm sorry to give you these memories\n\n'Cause memories like this will one day make you cry\n\nBut I'ma stick around\n\nI promise you that I will stick around for now\n\n\n\nLet these memories serve you right\n\nWhen I'm no longer right by your side\n\nHope you, by then. learned to fly\n\nAnd take with you the good things in life\n\n\n\nDon't let your big dreams don't turn into nightmares\n\nWhen our heroes are no longer out there\n\n\n\nI'm sorry to say that the smiles that I give you\n\nOne day will be tears in your eyes\n\nI'm sorry to give you these memories\n\n'Cause memories like this will one day make you cry\n\nBut I'ma stick around\n\nI promise you that I will stick around for now\n\n\n\nAnd right now, my light is shining\n\nThough one day that too will go out\n\nBut for now\n\nI'm gonna stick around\n\n\n\nI'm sorry to say that the smiles that I give you\n\nOne day will be tears in your eyes\n\nI'm sorry to give you these memories\n\n'Cause memories like this will one day make you cry\n\nBut I'ma stick around\n\nI promise you that I will stick around for now",
