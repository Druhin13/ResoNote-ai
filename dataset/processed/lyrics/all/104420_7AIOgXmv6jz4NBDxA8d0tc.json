  "lyrics": "(Yeah, uhhhh)\r\n(Yeah, uh, uhh)\r\nHurry up and bounce it before I forget\r\nWhat I made in my head\r\nI don't wanna spend my life thinking what they'll think or what they might\n\nIf I go see her show, she might collapse and lose her life\n\nI guess I'll save some money and save myself from wasting time, like\n\nFuck this lil' dyke, the way she's going, it'll be her fault if she ever dies\n\nAll that time you was talkin', that shit was eatin' me alive\n\nThrough the judgments, you didn't see I was fightin' for my life\n\nHow could I send signs? And God forgive me if I cry\n\nThen I'll become an attention seeker and not a leader\n\nSee people will only really understand you when they need you\n\nI guess I'm better off all alone in a two-seater\n\nPeople tellin' me to stop, don't be weak human being\n\nWhile the voice inside my head keeps tellin' me that I need it\n\nI now ask you, please stop judgin' me\n\nI got myself out this single handedly\n\nAnd we do what we do 'cause we don't understand the consequence\n\nOf every step we take is wrong, how could we ever see the mess?\n\n(uhh)\n\nAnd it's not just you and me, the whole youth is depressed\n\nLiving with the devil, constant battle every day\n\nWake up, gotta talk to people but I don't know what to say\n\nAnd they tellin' me get off my ass, I was born on the wrong path\n\n(yeah, mmm)\n\nAnd I'm tryna solve these problems, but I was always bad at math\n\n(mmm, yeah)\n\nAnd your voice has made it harder, and that's just honestly\n\nI had to shoot up to my brain to become the person that I wanna be\n\n(Yeah, oh)\n\nGrowin' up tryin' to figure out who you are\n\nSniffin' shit at 14, it becomes a little hard\n\nWhen you're livin' in a scene where the healthy shit is far\n\nBut the drugs are no further than your room or your car\n\nDon't be alarmed, it'll get brighter, it'll get better\n\nIt's 'cause we are fighters and tougher than leather\n\nThe strong you is inside, but you just haven't met her\n\nOnly we control our storm because we are the weather\n\nDon't get how I could love the things that really torn me\n\nRemember tellin' myself that I was quittin' in the mornin'\n\nAnd did you really try and help or was you tryna tell a story?\n\nIt's okay 'cause I got me and I don't need you to feel sorry\n\n\n\nThe future's bright, let's make it pro\n\nWe got us, we are the light\n\nWe are the world, we are love\n\nWe gotta fight for ourselves 'cause no one's gonna\n\nNo one's gonna\n\n(Yeah)\n\n\n\nI laugh when I'm with friends, but I'm sad when I'm alone\n\nAnd I be alone and I be alone and I be alone\n\nAnd I be alone\n\nAnd I be alone\n\nAnd I be alone\n\n(Yeah Uh)\n\nI laugh when I'm with friends but I'm sad when I'm alone\n\nAnd I be alone, I be alone (Yeah, ohhh)\n\nI laugh when I'm with friends but I'm sad when I'm alone\n\nAnd I be alone",
