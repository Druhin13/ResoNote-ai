  "lyrics": "What is authentic faith?\r\nThe cultivation of an optimistic outlook on life with a kind of spirituality attached to it?\r\nA holy hoping for the best?\r\nIs this how you think of faith?\r\nAuthentic faith is the confident assurance in events not yet seen\r\nFaith is not a call to believe in things when common sense tells you not to\n\nFaith is not a mindless stab in the dark\n\nIt is not a crossing of the fingers and hoping for the best\n\nIt is not a leap into apparent nothingness\n\nIt's a word that speaks of reasoned, careful, deliberate, intentional thought\n\nThought upon what? God and his promises\n\nIf you are absolutely gripped by the coming realities that have been promised to you by God, then how you live your life in the present will be radically different than if you did not possess that certainty\n\nThis is what faith is, my friends! Positive certainty expressed in action\n\nAuthentic faith is not merely believing in God. It is believing God\n\nTaking God at his word, living in obedience to his revelation whatever the cost because you know down deep in your bones that God will always do what he says, that his speaking is his doing\n\nIt is an abiding assurance in God in his promises that animates you to persevere in your obedience to Him\n\nDo you wish to be a more consistently obedient, steadily persevering Christian? A stronger Christian? A more courageous and outspoken Christian? Then you need to strengthen your faith!\n\nYour faith instinctively strengthens in direct proportion to the expansion of the object of your faith\n\nYou expand your understanding of the object of your faith and faith itself will obediently follow\n\nThe object of your faith---if indeed you are a Christian---is Jesus Christ and all of his promises\n\nIs your faith weak? It is owing to the fact you don't know the object of your faith well enough\n\nBut when Jesus Christ becomes progressively bigger, or better yet, your understanding of who he is progressively conforms to reality, your faith will become increasingly stronger\n\nBut how does that happen? By immersing yourself in the faith-arousing Word of God. Read of Jesus Christ\n\nThe same powerful Word that long ago brought the universe to life is the same Word that can bring you to life and furnish you with a faith that is truly and authentically Christian",
