  "lyrics": "Yeah!\r\nThis wall of stone\r\nThat they built to cage our minds\r\nGrip the call of changing times\r\nLike no one's home\n\nThey will burn down every bridge\n\nSpread the word of ignorance\n\nAll blind to your eyes\n\nForget the innocent\n\n\n\nSay a prayer, every night\n\nAll we hear must be right\n\nI am the outsider\n\nLiving life for the end\n\nNothing left to defend\n\nI am the outsider\n\n\n\nI'm not the hope\n\nThat's just wishing for the past\n\nLike bringing Christ back from the ash\n\nCould save the world\n\nThey have risen for the sins\n\nOf missing why we can't begin\n\nAnd not in this time\n\n\n\nSay a prayer, every night\n\nAll we hear must be right\n\nI am the outsider\n\nLiving life for the end\n\nNothing left to defend\n\nI am the outsider\n\n\n\nSay a prayer, every night\n\nAll we hear must be right\n\nEvery word, we believe!\n\n\n\nSay a prayer, every night\n\nAll we hear must be right (Must be right!)\n\nI am the outsider\n\nLiving life for the end\n\nNothing left to defend (Yeah!)\n\n\n\nI am the outsider\n\nI am the outsider\n\nI am the outsider",
