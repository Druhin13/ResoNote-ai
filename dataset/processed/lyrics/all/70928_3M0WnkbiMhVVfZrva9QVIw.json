  "lyrics": "Open here\r\nTake a peek before tomorrow\r\nIt was the best in the shop and the very first one to go\r\nOnce you start you never stop\r\nYou were once the golden boy of the golden days\n\nEverybody wanted a piece of you\n\nTurning on the city lights like magic\n\nEverybody wanted a piece of you\n\nFor themselves\n\n\n\nOpen here\n\nTake a rest before tomorrow\n\nToo fond of the bar and the very last one to go\n\nOnce you start you never stop\n\n\n\nYou were warned, to play the queen was dangerous\n\nEverybody wanted to be with you\n\nWho could have been there to relieve you from the fame?\n\nWhen anyone who was anyone, they fell for you\n\nIn love with you\n\n\n\nOpen here\n\nTake a peek before tomorrow\n\nToo fond of the part of the very last one to go\n\nOnce you start you never stop",
