  "lyrics": "It all set in so slow\r\nThere's no light\r\nI fear the twilight of my prime\r\nBecause right now it feels so much\r\nLike it’s gonna be the end of my little life\r\nI wanna drain the marrow 'fore I make old bones\n\nIt's been really nice to know you but for now I gotta go\n\nI'm not long for this world\n\nIt's nice to know, mwah\n\n\n\nSo are we water without solubility?\n\nWe're not so bright for breathing cosmic debris\n\nNo, we can’t see\n\nI want vertiginous height and speed\n\nThat just might kill me\n\n\n\nI am not a spirit of a vision like those young lovelies\n\nAnd I'm never gonna feign an admission\n\n'Cause that doesn't interest me\n\nI know there's much more left than this slow death\n\nThat we all suffer at their behest\n\nBut I just can't see\n\nWhat's happening to me\n\n\n\nBecause I'm never gonna see what I'm missing with eyes on my feet\n\nAnd I'm never call this a living\n\nWhen it's all so rote and unhappy\n\nHow can I say I made a change\n\nWhen I'm getting further every day?\n\nI'm not one for this world\n\n(From consistency, from some stability)\n\nIt's nice to know, mwah\n\n\n\nSo are we water without solubility?\n\nWe're not so bright for breathing cosmic debris\n\nNo, we can't see\n\nI want vertiginous height and speed\n\nThat just might kill me\n\n\n\nOne day you're here and the next day you're gone\n\nThe only purpose I feel remains in song\n\nIf Freddie wrote his Rhapsody at 29\n\nMaybe I still have time for mine\n\nI know a poet will find no use for peace\n\nI know this is the only way it should be\n\nI'll be dead before I know I’m dying\n\nBut it doesn’t feel unnatural to me\n\n\n\nSo I howl at the sun\n\nIt's taken years but I feel that I'm done\n\nTaking posies out my pockets\n\nWe can all fall down, we can stop it\n\nThere's no place for me, my ten dollar words\n\nAnd all the little vanities this world incurs\n\nIt's sixes and sevens\n\nCan we create a heaven?\n\n\n\nSo are we water without solubility?\n\nWe're not so bright for breathing cosmic debris\n\nNo, we can't see\n\nI want vertiginous height and speed\n\n(That just might kill me)\n\nSo are we water without solubility?\n\nWe're not so bright for breathing cosmic debris\n\nNo, we can’t see\n\nI want vertiginous height and speed\n\nThat just might kill me\n\n\n\nI am not a spirit of a vision like those young lovelies\n\nAnd I'm never gonna feign an admission\n\n'Cause that doesn't interest me\n\nI know there's much more left than this slow death\n\nThat we all suffer at their behest\n\nBut I just can't see\n\nWhat's happening to me",
