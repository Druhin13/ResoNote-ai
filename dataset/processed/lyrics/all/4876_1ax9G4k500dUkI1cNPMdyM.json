Well you're not alone\r\nCause I'm here for you when you need to let it go\r\nLet the world spin on its own\r\nAnd the storm will pass before you even know\r\nJust remember that\n\nAlways break from the heavy weather\n\nCast a light, let's walk together\n\nSide by side beside our crooked shadows\n\nOnly a fool would even try for this\n\nWe'll be the ones who get away with it\n\nRunning side by side beside our crooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows\n\nOur crooked shadows\n\n\n\nLeave your keys, you won't need them\n\nOnly bring what we can carry on the run\n\nI believe, I believe in us\n\nCause together you and I are strong enough\n\n\n\nAlways break from the heavy weather\n\nCast a light, let's walk together\n\nSide by side beside our crooked shadows\n\nOnly a fool would even try for this\n\nWe'll be the ones who get away with it\n\nRunning side by side beside our crooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows\n\nOur crooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows\n\n\n\nOnly a fool would even try for this\n\nWe'll be the ones who get away with it\n\nRunning side by side beside our crooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows\n\nOur crooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows\n\nCrooked shadows",
