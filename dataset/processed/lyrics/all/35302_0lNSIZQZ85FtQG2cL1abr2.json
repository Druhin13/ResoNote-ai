  "lyrics": "Oh, setting Sun,\r\nThy red rays maketh me cry.\r\nThey remind me of the one\r\nWhose love awaits me in the sky.\r\nA bridal bed awaits us both\n\nAfter the landscape of death I cross.\n\nBefore my sorrows I must die,\n\nNightwish I send through the starlit sky.\n\n\n\nThe voice of nightly winds has awakened me,\n\nAmidst all the grief they embrace me with relief.\n\nBeneath my dreams and wishes\n\nI long for thy caresses.\n\n\n\nA bridal bed awaits us both,\n\nAfter the landscape of death I cross.\n\nBefore my sorrows I must die,\n\nNightwish I send through the starlit sky.\n\n\n\n\"Passed away in silence\n\nThe flute from the realm unseen\n\nEmpties its heart\n\nMaking love to me\n\nWith its enchanting melody.\n\nLight of Orion,\n\nShadow of Andromeda,\n\nCall of the dancing Universe.\n\nTheir love I must enter\n\nBefore thou can blame my soul\n\nThat is peace\"",
