  "lyrics": "Started with a daydream, saying \"yes please, could u pass the keys\"\r\nLet 'em all dissuade me, underrate me, but I don't play with sheep\r\nGonna redesign the scene, make a new breed, new gene, new creed\r\nDo it for the A team in the making, I'm like \"yes queen\"\r\nThis that female gaze, too unfazed\r\nWalk with mace, just in case\n\nBut still I got more bands than bodyweight\n\nFrom the sock drawer to the briefcase\n\nFuck your wallet, I-I-I make it rain\n\nFuture of the human race\n\nNot here to procreate\n\nJust fuck your brain, then coup de grâce\n\n\n\nNo lie, I don’t need your cosign\n\nBetter treat the pussy right\n\nOpen up your third eye\n\nNo lie, I don’t need your cosign\n\nBetter treat the pussy right\n\nOpen up your third eye\n\n\n\nThey wanna see my tears\n\nThey wanna smell my fear\n\nFuck it, just hold my beer\n\nI’m 'bout to interfere\n\nSwitching the fucking gear\n\nUp in your fucking ear\n\nScreaming it loud and clear\n\nI am that bitch of the year\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Jahan Yousaf]\n\nStep aside I'm next in line\n\nNever mind, now's my time\n\nThat’s my life, my tribe\n\nI rise, I grind\n\nPour the chai I got the spice\n\nStir fry flame high, open wide, take a bite\n\nHold up\n\nHold me back, I’ll pull up\n\nHold me back, I’ll pull up\n\n\n\nNo lie, I don’t need your cosign\n\nBetter treat the pussy right\n\nOpen up your third eye\n\nNo lie, I don’t need your cosign\n\nBetter treat the pussy right\n\nOpen up your third eye\n\n\n\nThey wanna see my tears\n\nThey wanna smell my fear\n\nFuck it, just hold my beer\n\nI’m 'bout to interfere\n\nSwitching the fucking gear\n\nUp in your fucking ear\n\nScreaming it loud and clear\n\nI am that bitch of the year",
