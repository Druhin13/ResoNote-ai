  "lyrics": "Losing balance as I weigh out my options\r\nIt's an everyday morning routine\r\nThrough every hazy memory\r\nAt any second you can recount the climax\r\nNot as vivid as it used to be\r\nThrough every hazy memory\n\n\n\nThe walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out\n\nThe shelter they provide only houses self doubt\n\nI'm reclaiming my composure\n\nLately I've been smiling, pretend to be stable\n\nBeen avoiding conversation\n\nBut lately I've been smiling, pretend to be stable\n\n\n\nLife's unfolding like the plot of a movie\n\nNot the version that everyone sees\n\nMy dreams laid out in front of me (like dreams laid out in front of me)\n\nI never told anyone, but the truth is I see the shadow hanging over me\n\n\n\nThe walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out\n\nThe shelter they provide only houses self doubt\n\nI'm reclaiming my composure\n\nLately I've been smiling, pretend to be stable\n\nBeen avoiding conversation\n\nBut lately I've been smiling, pretend to be stable\n\n\n\nThe walls were built so high, but couldn't keep their words out\n\nThe shelter they provide only houses self doubt\n\nI'm reclaiming my composure\n\nLately I've been smiling, pretend to be stable\n\nBeen avoiding conversation\n\nBut lately I've been smiling, pretend to be stable",
