  "lyrics": "Darkness holds\r\nBegging me to lose control\r\nWe wrestle it back and forth ‘til urban silence\r\nCuts through night\r\nWith a scalpel for the light\r\nThat bleeds through the margins\n\nAnd leaves me semi-conscious\n\n\n\nI haven’t found the rhythm yet\n\nTo anchor down my life\n\nI didn’t know I needed one\n\nTo hold me through the night\n\n\n\nAin’t it great\n\nSmashing through the interstate\n\nWhere we guess the futures of\n\nOur concurrent strangers?\n\nThey’re on their way to the doctor or to raise\n\nGrandkids of young twenty-somethings\n\nAnd teenagers\n\n\n\nI’m worried of abandoning\n\nThe joys that framed my life\n\nBut all this useless energy\n\nWon’t hold me through the night\n\n\n\nOh please\n\nYou’re not fooling anyone\n\nWhen you say you tried your best\n\n‘cause you can’t be your best anything\n\nWhen you can’t get any rest\n\n\n\nOh please\n\nYou’re not fooling anyone\n\nWhen you say you tried your best\n\n‘cause you can’t be your best anything\n\nWhen you can’t get any rest\n\n\n\nI’m worried of abandoning\n\nThe joys that framed my life\n\nBut all this useless energy\n\nWon’t hold me through the night\n\nWon’t hold me through the night\n\nWon’t hold me through\n\nWon’t hold me through the night",
