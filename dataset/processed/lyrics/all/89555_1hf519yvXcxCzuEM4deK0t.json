  "lyrics": "I've been away, a little while\r\nSometimes I just can't help myself\r\nWhen my mind's running wild\r\nI seem to lose grip on reality\r\nAnd I try to disregard the crazy things\r\nThe voices tell me to do but it's no use\n\nI tried to own it, write songs about it\n\nBelieve me, I tried, in the end I needed to breathe\n\nFind inspiration, some kind of purpose\n\nTo take a second to face the shit that makes me me\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room and say it all out loud\n\nEvery moment, every second, every trespass\n\nEvery awful thing, every broken dream\n\nA couple years back and forth with myself in a cage\n\nBanging my head against the wall, tryna put words on a page\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room, alone in a room\n\n\n\nI saw the world a couple times\n\nTried to cure the ache with absence\n\nBut that hole was still a hole\n\nAnd my mind kept playing tricks on me\n\nFeeling older every day\n\nTook everything I had to not crash and burn\n\nBut I'm starting to learn\n\nSometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope\n\nBut those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground\n\nI might be lonely but I ain't alone here\n\nSo I keep pushing the limits of what makes me me\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room and say it all out loud\n\nEvery moment, every second, every trespass\n\nEvery awful thing, every broken dream\n\nA couple years back and forth with myself in a cage\n\nBanging my head against the wall, tryna put words on a page\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room, alone in a room\n\n\n\nI can be better than I was\n\nI can be better than I am\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room and say it all out loud\n\nEvery moment, every second, every trespass\n\nEvery awful thing, every broken dream\n\nA couple years back and forth with myself in a cage\n\nBanging my head against the wall, tryna put words on a page\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room, alone in a room",
