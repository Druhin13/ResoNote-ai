  "lyrics": "Say, can you hear?\r\nIs there a meaning to your grief?\r\nWhere there is pain you see grace\r\nAs if sacrifice was meaningful and in itself\r\nYour trial and error is error and error\n\nStaying at the end of a hallway\n\nDozens of doors you never tried to open\n\nNarrow vision, you’re the scapegoat\n\nTry to fix things that have never been\n\n\n\nYou’re self-absorbed\n\nRaving about your cryptic ways\n\nAren’t willing to change\n\nOld grudges\n\n\n\nHoping for your turn\n\nAll the basement stories you heard\n\nWaiting for the world\n\nTo bend around you\n\n\n\nStaying at the end of a hallway\n\nDozens of doors you never tried to open\n\nNarrow vision, you’re the scapegoat\n\nTry to fix things that have never been\n\n\n\nWaiting for the world to bend around you\n\nWaiting for the world to bend around you\n\n\n\nStaying at the end of a hallway\n\nDozens of doors you never tried to open\n\nNarrow vision, you’re the scapegoat\n\nTry to fix things that have never been broken",
