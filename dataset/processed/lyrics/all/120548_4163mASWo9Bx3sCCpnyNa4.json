  "lyrics": "You put salt in the wound\r\nAnd a kiss on my cheek\r\nYou butter me up\r\nAnd you sit down to eat\r\nYou add insult to injury\r\nYou say you believe in me\n\nBut you haven’t decided\n\nAbout taking or leaving me\n\n\n\nBut you take and you take\n\nLike silks up my sleeve\n\nTied corner to corner, never ending\n\nTrick after trick, I make the magic\n\nAnd you unrelentingly ask for the secret\n\n\n\nNeck full of mockingbirds\n\nAll calling your name\n\nI tried to sing it all back\n\nLike I heard it, it don’t sound the same\n\nI’m gnashing my teeth\n\nLike a child of Cain\n\nIf this is a prison I’m willing to burn my own chain\n\n\n\nBut you take and you take\n\nLike silks up my sleeve\n\nTied corner to corner, never ending\n\nTrick after trick, I make the magic\n\nAnd you unrelentingly ask for the secret\n\n\n\nThey say the hearts and minds are on your side\n\nThey say the finish line is in your sights\n\nWhat they don’t say is what's on the other side\n\nThey say the hearts and minds are on your side",
