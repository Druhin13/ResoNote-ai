  "lyrics": "There is a river where goodness flows\r\nThere is a fountain that drowns sorrows\r\nThere is an ocean deeper than fear\r\nThe tide is rising, rising\r\nThere is a current stirring deep inside\n\nIt's overflowing from the heart of God\n\nThe flood of heaven crashing over us\n\nThe tide is rising, rising\n\n\n\nBursting, bursting\n\nUp from the ground, we feel it now\n\nBursting, bursting\n\nUp from the ground, we feel it now\n\n\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a current stirring deep inside\n\nIt's overflowing from the heart of God\n\nThe flood of heaven crashing over us\n\nThe tide is rising, rising\n\n\n\nBursting, bursting\n\nUp from the ground, we feel it now\n\nBursting, bursting\n\nUp from the ground, we feel it now!\n\n\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\n\n\n\n\nBreak open prison doors\n\nSet all the captives free\n\nSpring up a well, spring up a well\n\nSpring up a well in me\n\nNothing can stop this joy\n\nWe're dancing in the streets\n\nSpring up a well, spring up a well\n\nSpring a well in me!\n\n\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\n\n\n\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river\n\nWe come alive in the river",
