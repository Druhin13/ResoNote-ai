  "lyrics": "You see, my mental/emotional cycle has always been that of the phoenix. On a subconscious level, though I'm conscious of it as I write this, I feel the need to continually destroy myself and then rebuild myself. Destroy, rebuild. Destroy, rebuild\r\nI dreamt that I was home\r\nI dreamt that I was home\r\nI dreamt that I was home\r\nI dreamt that I was home",
