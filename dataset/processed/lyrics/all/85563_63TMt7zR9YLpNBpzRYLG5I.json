  "lyrics": "First time in a barroom when I was just a boy\r\nTwo men commenced to fightin', it was fightin' they enjoyed\r\nAs fast as it started, it was over and done\r\nOne man left standin', there could only be one\r\nWell he looked me in the eye and he said, \"C'mon, son\r\nIt's time to drink some whiskey, and this is how it's done\"\n\n\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nYeah, this is how it's done\n\n\n\nNow honky-tonks and juke joints, they fast became my home\n\nAlways in good company wherever I would roam\n\nStompin' to the music with a cold one in my hand\n\nOne night, a pretty cowgirl's eyes cried\n\n\"Catch me if you can\"\n\nWell, I followed her to the dance floor and she showed me where she's from\n\nWhen I yelled out to the crowd, \"Hey, now this is how it's done\"\n\n\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nYeah, this is how it's done\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nYeah, this is how it's done\n\n\n\nNow I ain't lookin' for no trouble, but backin' down won't do\n\nI'd rather sip my whiskey and buy a round for you\n\nWell, if you insist on fightin', well, you may be sorry, son\n\nCause you're messin' with a veteran of kicking ass for fun\n\n\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nYeah, this is how it's done\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nYeah, this is how it's done, son\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nYeah, this is how it's done\n\nThis is how it's done\n\nNow this is how it's done",
