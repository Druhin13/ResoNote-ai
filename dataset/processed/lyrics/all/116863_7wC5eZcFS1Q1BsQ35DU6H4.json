  "lyrics": "Hmm, hmm\r\nWake up and smell the coffee\r\nIs your cup half full or empty?\r\nWhen we talk, you say it softly\r\nBut I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet\n\n\n\nYou see a piece of paper\n\nCould be a little greater\n\nShow me what you could make her\n\nYou'll never know until you try it\n\nAnd you don't have to keep it quiet\n\n\n\nAnd I know it makes you nervous\n\nBut I promise you, it's worth it\n\nTo show 'em everything you kept inside\n\nDon't hide, don't hide\n\nToo shy to say, but I hope you stay\n\nDon't hide away\n\nCome out and play\n\n\n\nLook up, out of your window\n\nSee snow, won't let it in though\n\nLeave home, feel the wind blow\n\n'Cause it's colder here inside in silence\n\nYou don't have to keep it quiet\n\n\n\nYeah, I know it makes you nervous\n\nBut I promise you, it's worth it\n\nTo show 'em everything you kept inside\n\nDon't hide, don't hide\n\nToo shy to say but I hope you stay\n\nDon't hide away\n\nCome out and play",
