  "lyrics": "Sick of having empty habits\r\nLeading to the selfish havoc\r\nI’m lonely in my own bones\r\nYou’re unweaving where you stand\r\nStitch me into all your plans\r\nJust like a cherry stone\n\n\n\nTemporary fleeting thrills\n\nKeep me bruised and make me ill\n\nMy skin has lavender tones\n\nTell me I’m a loaded gun\n\nTie me up and come undone\n\n\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it up\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\n\n\nI know I’m out of my depth, but I just float in it\n\nI try to do my best, stop picking fights with it\n\nI wanna be upset, you’re not alright with it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\nTry to speak my mind, wish it was by design\n\nBut I can only confess to having doubts with it\n\nDon’t wanna feel regret, I’m not alright with it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\n(I can cover it up, I can cover it up)\n\n\n\nSpending time with or without you\n\nCutting corners just to get\n\nYou out of my god damn mind\n\nKeep your words up where they’re brewing\n\nI want something worth pursuing\n\nStill letting you curl my spine\n\n\n\nTemporary fleeting thrills\n\nKeep me bruised and make me ill\n\nMy lonely lavender bones\n\nTell me how to hurt for fun\n\nTie me up and come undone\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\n\n\nI know I’m out of my depth, but I just float in it\n\nI try to do my best, stop picking fights with it\n\nI wanna be upset, you’re not alright with it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\nTry to speak my mind, wish it was by design\n\nBut I can only confess to having doubts with it\n\nDon’t wanna feel regret, I’m not alright with it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\n\n\nWhat have I done?\n\nChewing on my words\n\nNothing’s enough, I rinse myself in the dirt\n\nSold all my time to a plastic ecstasy\n\nNothing's enough\n\n\n\nI know I’m out of my depth, but I just float in it\n\nI try to do my best, stop picking fights with it\n\nI wanna be upset, you’re not alright with it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\nTry to speak my mind, wish it was by design\n\nBut I can only confess to having doubts with it\n\nDon’t wanna feel regret, I’m not alright with it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\n\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it up\n\nWhat have I done?\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it\n\nNothing's enough\n\nI can cover it up, I can cover it up",
