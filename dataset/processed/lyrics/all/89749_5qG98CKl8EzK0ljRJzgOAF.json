  "lyrics": "Freeze frame, tidal wave in the passenger side\r\nI'm still a nervous kid after all this time\r\nCan you imagine what it's like to be here with you now?\r\nForget your current lover, remember me that one July?\r\nLaying bareback on dirt roads, watching the planes at night\r\nI knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side\n\n\n\nNow I'm awake at 2AM\n\nWithout a cause to draw you in\n\n\n\nBuy low, sell high kind of guy\n\nInvest your time in what's worthwhile\n\nWas I a risk without reward or did I make you proud?\n\n\n\nNow I'm awake at 2AM\n\nWithout a cause to draw you in\n\n\n\nI'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it\n\nYou'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter\n\nYou've got addictions too, it's true\n\nYou've got addictions too\n\n\n\nYou've been around the world and back\n\nAlways return to the ones you love\n\nYou've got a sense of adventure\n\nAn adventure for comfort that keeps you at home\n\n\n\nI'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it\n\nYou'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter\n\nYou've got addictions too, it's true\n\nYou've got addictions too\n\n\n\nReleasing\n\nYears of senseless waiting\n\nYou've got addictions too, it's true\n\nYou've got addictions too\n\nYou've got addictions too, it's true\n\nYou've got addictions too\n\nYou've got addictions too, it's true\n\nYou've got addictions too\n\nYou've got addictions too, it's true\n\nYou've got addictions too",
