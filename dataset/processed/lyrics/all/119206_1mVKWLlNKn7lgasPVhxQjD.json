  "lyrics": "I am so tired, I have to tame my mind before I get too frustrated\r\nCan't go back in time to change in someone's eyes that I was not something to play with\r\nTry not to talk about it, I'm too mad, I'm too late, I'm too gentle\r\nIt's too hard to explain, I'm not helpful\r\nIt's my body and I'm trying to hate you cause I want to\n\nIt's my body and I'm trying to while everybody loves you\n\nIt's my body and I'm trying to forgive you, I don't want to\n\nIt's my body and it hates you, why does everybody love you?\n\n\n\nSometimes I close my eyes amidst the dancing lights\n\nWhen it feels too wild for breathing\n\nI can't sleep at night, unless I start to lie and believe it like a story\n\nTry not to think about it so insane, I'm so used to my nightmares\n\nIt's ok 'til it's not and I'm back there\n\n\n\nIt's my body and I'm trying to hate you cause I want to\n\nIt's my body and I'm trying to while everybody loves you\n\nIt's my body and I'm trying to forgive you, I don't want to\n\nIt's my body and it hates you, why does everybody love you?\n\nWhy does everybody love you?\n\nThey don't know enough about you\n\nDo they know that I regret you?\n\nDo they know I shouldn't have to?\n\nWhy does everybody love you?\n\nThey don't know enough about you\n\nDo they know that I regret you?\n\nDo they know I shouldn't have to?",
