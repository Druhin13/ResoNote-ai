  "lyrics": "Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue\r\nAnd this baby ain't no fair, taking up my youth\r\nYou've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth\r\nBut I see it in your eyes, the things that you do\r\nI don't wanna waste no time\n\nAll alone\n\nWant somewhere to go\n\nSomething to call my own\n\nAnd I ain't satisfied\n\nWhere to go?\n\nLost out on the road\n\nWashed up on the shore\n\n\n\nAnd I've been through mountains and seas\n\nTryna get you to come back to me\n\nAnd I've been far, and I've been so deep\n\nNow I find it harder and harder to breathe\n\nAnd I need some new love\n\nNew love\n\nNew love\n\n\n\nEven though I've run away, I still come back\n\nNo there's nothing more to say, it's all been said\n\nI've been trying to explain the things we hide\n\nTo all of my friends who say that I've gone mad\n\n\n\nI don't wanna waste no time\n\nAll alone\n\nWant somewhere to go\n\nSomething to call my own\n\nAnd I ain't satisfied\n\nWhere to go?\n\nLost out on the road\n\nWashed up on the shore\n\n\n\nAnd I've been through mountains and seas\n\nTryna get you to come back to me\n\nAnd I've been far, and I've been so deep\n\nNow I find it harder and harder to breathe\n\nAnd I need some new love\n\nNew love\n\nNew love\n\n\n\nEasy come, easy go\n\nWhy are we living on, living on\n\nIf we're not getting old, getting old?\n\nCan we just let it go?\n\nCause we're waiting for a miracle\n\nWhy wait for a miracle?\n\n\n\nAnd I've been through mountains and seas\n\nTryna get you to come back to me\n\nAnd I've been far, and I've been so deep\n\nNow I find it harder and harder to breathe\n\nAnd I need some new love\n\nNew love\n\nNew love",
