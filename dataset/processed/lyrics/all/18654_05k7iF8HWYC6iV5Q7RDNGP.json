  "lyrics": "Getting lost singing their song\r\nCaught up in all I've done\r\nIt's all I know, but not what I need\r\nCut by my love, cut till I bleed\r\nSo I want to run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun to the shelter tonight\n\nUnited in silent resistance\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\n\nSo let me run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun from this meaningless pantomime\n\nI'll swallow my pride, give up the pretence\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\n\nBought their smiles, liquid and smooth\n\nTook their words for the truth\n\nEdge of light and shade\n\nMy broken soul once more enslaved\n\n\n\nSo I want to run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun to the shelter tonight\n\nUnited in silent resistance\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\n\nSo let me run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun from this meaningless pantomime\n\nI see the false kings\n\nI see that all this\n\nMust end\n\n\n\nWhen there's no love in my embrace\n\nCold blood runs through my veins\n\nIf I soar without grace\n\nDo I still soar?\n\n\n\nI need the love in your embrace\n\nOpen doors, brand new ways\n\nEnd my wars and erase\n\nAnd I'm yours\n\n\n\nSo I want to run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun to the shelter tonight\n\nUnited in silent resistance\n\nOf bowing to false kings\n\n\n\nSo let me run to your shelter tonight\n\nRun from this meaningless pantomime\n\nI'll swallow my pride, give up the pretence\n\n\n\nYes, I wined and, and I dined on, on that cyanide",
