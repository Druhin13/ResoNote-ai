  "lyrics": "Cow-skin cowboy boots donned, but you aren't from Texas\r\nStrawberry lemonade made, but you're not a child\r\nAnd so you saved it, and you made it into an adult beverage\r\nCalled it \"twin's twist\"\r\n'Cause it's the simple tricks that help you seem wild\r\nSure, it's the sugar surfacing on the sour\r\nMasking a moment with a happiness hour\r\nThe lemon rind can reek in the summer heat\r\nBut then seem so sweet later on\r\nâ™ª\r\nGot that 'Chronic 2000'-high-school state of mind\r\nBurning mom's gas, you're smashed\r\nAnd it's fueling your rhymes about the 2-liter hits\r\nThat you get with a little help from gravity\r\nThe high keeps you on the ground\r\nWhen your favorite one in town isn't around\r\nKissing other people and trying not to fall in love\r\nDancing in the darkness, but in the daytime, it's just a shrug\r\nThe lemon rind can reek in the summer heat\r\nBut then seem so sweet later on\r\nFinding fruit to eat in February\r\nDreams of losing teeth in a month, so sleep off that one\r\nGood morning, boring town\r\nBuy your disguise for a dollar down\r\nWe're putting on your crown and singing you happy birthday\r\nAnd force feeding you meringue\r\nThe lemon rind can reek in the summer heat\r\nBut then seem so sweet later on\r\nFinding fruit to eat in February\r\nDreams of losing teeth in a month, so sleep off that one",
