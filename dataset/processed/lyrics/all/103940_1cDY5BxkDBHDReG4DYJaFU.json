  "lyrics": "Well you're right that no one informed you,\r\nI guess I should have warned you, it's all a contest\r\nAnd you said they all wanted to hide you,\r\nBut when they got deep inside you, it's a big mess\r\nAnd you know me better now and you see I'm in the middle\r\nAnd you don't know why or how but you sold me down your river\n\nAnd I'm just plain ol' sandwiched in-between\n\nSo save your water woman I won't drink out of your stream\n\nWell the shouts of a thousand disciples and the brass Winchester rifles brought the house down\n\nAnd I know that I don't concern you, but life's got a way it can burn you, you lose the high ground\n\nAnd you know me better now and you see I'm in the middle\n\nAnd you don't know why or how but you sold me down your river\n\nAnd I'm just plain ol' sandwiched in-between\n\nSo save your water woman I won't drink out of your stream\n\nYou're a match that I have burned, you're a page that I have turned, and you know the rest\n\nYou know I'd never steal your water, it was your whining boss-man's daughter, your half-brother confessed\n\nAnd you know me better now and you see I'm in the middle\n\nAnd you don't know why or how but you sold me down your river\n\nAnd I'm just plain ol' sandwiched in-between\n\nSo save your water woman I won't drink out of your stream\n\nYeah, save your water woman I won't drink out of your stream.",
