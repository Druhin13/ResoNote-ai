I'm hopin' not\n\n'Cause maybe we could go to the movies\n\nI know that always cheers us up, hey\n\n\n\nI'm so sorry\n\nThough we're still stuck in the middle\n\nYeah, I'm so sorry\n\n'Cause in the moment I\n\n\n\nI don't know what it's like to be you\n\nI don't know what it's like but I'm dying to\n\nIf I could put myself in your shoes\n\nThen I'd know what it's like to be you\n\n\n\nTell me what's inside of your head\n\nNo matter what you say I won't love you less\n\nAnd I'd be lying if I said that I do\n\nI don't know what it's like to be you\n\nI don't know what it's like to be you\n\n\n\nI get worried\n\nI might lose you a little\n\nEvery time we\n\nEvery time we argue and get caught up in the moment\n\n\n\nI don't know what it's like to be you\n\nI don't know what it's like but I'm dying to\n\nIf I could put myself in your shoes\n\nThen I'd know what it's like to be you\n\n\n\nSo tell me what's inside of your head\n\nNo matter what you say I won't love you less\n\nAnd I'd be lying if I said that I do\n\nI don't know what it's like to be you\n\nI don't know what it's like to be you\n\nI don't know what it's like",
