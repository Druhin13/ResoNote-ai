  "lyrics": "Too many cuts and too many broken bones\r\nDraining the life, burying skeletons\r\nDo or die, is this the feeling I'm craving?\r\nWaiting for life to ignite\r\nIs this the moment for taking?\r\nA leap of faith, I'll...\n\n\n\nJump into the fire, no fear\n\nTaken to the edge but it still can't break me\n\nI'm not caving in\n\n\n\nThe beat of a pulse, feeling it resonate\n\nInto the night, hearing it fade away\n\nDo or die, this is choice that I’m making\n\nFeels like I’m living a lie\n\nThis is the moment for taking\n\nA leap of faith I’ll...\n\n\n\nJump into the fire, no fear\n\nTaken to the edge but it still can’t break me\n\nI’m not caving in\n\nNothing's gonna kill me, come take me\n\nCloser to the edge but it still won’t break me\n\nI’m not caving in\n\n\n\nSo fill your lungs, inhale the future\n\nNow scream it out\n\nSo fill your lungs, inhale the future\n\nNow scream it out\n\nRelease the pressure!\n\n\n\nSo fill your lungs, inhale the future\n\nNow scream it out\n\nRelease the pressure!\n\nSo fill your lungs, inhale the future\n\nNow scream it out\n\n\n\nJump into the fire, no fear\n\nTaken to the edge but it still can’t break me\n\nI’m not caving in\n\nNothing's gonna kill me, come take me\n\nCloser to the edge but it still won’t break me\n\nI’m not caving in\n\n\n\n(Jump into the fire)\n\n(Jump into the fire)\n\nI'm not caving in\n\n\n\nToo many cuts and too many broken bones",
