  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Real Life par Kimbra\r\nIf I had to find a process\nWhat it would it be?\nTo try to make progress\nWhere would I reach?\n\n? for regret to invade\nIn my real life, real life, real\nNow it's real life, real life, real\n\nI had to find my progress\nMy heart to be unbroken\nWould I change real life, real life, real\nWas real life, real life, real?\nIt's real life, real life, real\nReal life, real life, real\n\n\nThere's nothing to find, nothing to find\nThe time to be alive\nTrying to make sense of it\nThere's nothing to find, nothing to find\nNothing to be if you lose your mind\nTry to make sense of it\n\nThere's nothing to find, nothing to find\nNobody got time in the real life",
