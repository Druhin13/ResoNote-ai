Ooh na na\n\nI can’t wait ’til tonight ‘cause I am, ready for you, ready for you\n\nCan you make it rock? Ooh na na\n\nI can’t wait ’til tonight ‘cause I am, ready for you, ready for you\n\n\n\nThe sun don’t shine but we still have you\n\nI don’t need time if I just have you\n\nI love your ass, please send nudes\n\nIf it ain’t you then it ain’t true\n\nI know you’re the one\n\nKnow that you are made for me baby\n\nI’m not here for fun, there’s not parting ways with me baby\n\nI just wanna make you life better\n\nNot just the night\n\nI just wanna make your legs quiver\n\nThe time for a new life\n\n\n\nCan you make it rock? Ooh na na\n\nI can’t wait ’til tonight ‘cause I am, ready for you, ready for you\n\nCan you make it rock? Ooh na na\n\nI can’t wait ’til tonight ‘cause I am, ready for you, ready for you\n\n\n\nCan you make it rock? Ooh na na\n\nI can’t wait ’til tonight ‘cause I am, ready for you, ready for you\n\nCan you make it rock? Ooh na na\n\nI can’t wait ’til tonight ‘cause I am, ready for you, ready for you",
