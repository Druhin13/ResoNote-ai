  "lyrics": "I was writing down today’s date\r\nFebruary one eight\r\nFeels the same as yesterday\r\nThought I heard your voice real low\r\nComin’ through the radio\r\nThat’s when I realized\n\n\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot you\n\n\n\nRed light so I brake hard\n\nDropped the phone in my car\n\nAnd your picture slipped from under the seat\n\nGreen light just a memory\n\nCrazy what this used to mean\n\nNow it doesn't faze me\n\n\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot you\n\n\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot, I forgot you\n\nI forgot you\n\n\n\nYour name in Sharpie on my dresser, baby (I forgot you)\n\nListenin’ to Frank and thinkin’ maybe (I forgot you)\n\nAll these feels I used to have but lately (I forgot you)\n\nI remember why I forgot, I forgot you",
