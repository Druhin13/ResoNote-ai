  "lyrics": "She was lost in so many different ways \nOut in the darkness with no guide \nI know the cost of a losing hand \nNever thought the grace of God go high \nI found heaven on earth \n\nYou were my last, my first \n\nAnd then I hear this voice inside \n\nAve Maria \n\n\n\nI've been alone \n\nWhen I'm surrounded by friends \n\nHow could the silence be so loud \n\nBut I still go home knowing that I've got you \n\nThere's us when the lights go down \n\n\n\nYou are my heaven on earth \n\nYou are my hunger, my thirst \n\nI always hear this voice inside \n\nSinging Ave Maria \n\n\n\nSometimes love can come and pass you by \n\nWhile your busy making plans \n\nSuddenly hit you and then you realize \n\nIt's out of your hands, baby you got to understand \n\n\n\nYou are my heaven on earth \n\nYou are my last, my first \n\nAnd then I hear this voice inside \n\nAve Maria \n\nAve Maria \n\nAve Maria",
