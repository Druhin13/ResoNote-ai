  "lyrics": "I’m high and dry, where no one can see\r\nIf there’s no one to blame, blame it on me\r\nStorm in the sky, fire in the street\r\nIf there’s nothing but pain, put it on me\r\nYou are the cold inescapable truth\n\nYou’re evil, the way in the life and the truth\n\nYou’re revival, beginning and you’re genocide\n\nAnd I watch in wonder\n\nYou are the cold inescapable truth\n\nYou’re evil, the way in the life and the truth\n\nYou’re revival, beginning and you’re genocide\n\nAnd I watch in wonder\n\n\n\nI’m high and dry, where no one can see\n\nIf there’s no one to blame, blame it on me\n\nStorm in the sky, fire in the street\n\nIf there’s nothing but pain, put it on me\n\n\n\nI know that you’d never feel like I do\n\nAnd I’d break into pieces right in front of you\n\nAnd I’d burn down the city and string up the noose\n\nAnd you watch in wonder\n\n\n\nI’m high and dry, where no one can see\n\nIf there’s no one to blame, blame it on me\n\nStorm in the sky, fire in the trees\n\nIf there’s nothing but pain, put it on me\n\n\n\nI know that you’d never feel like I do\n\nWill break into pieces right in front of you\n\nI will burn down the city and string up the noose\n\nAnd you’ll watch in wonder",
