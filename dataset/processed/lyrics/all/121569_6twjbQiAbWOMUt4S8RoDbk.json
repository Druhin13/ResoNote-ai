  "lyrics": "You won't believe it, strange as it sounds\r\nExtraordinary magic follows you around\r\nAnd the camera can't catch it, you won't see it in the mirror\r\nIf I say look behind you, you turn around, it disappears\r\nBut I see it, I see it\n\nI swear I do\n\nI see extraordinary magic in you\n\n\n\nOutta thin air, you appeared in my life\n\nLike a burst of technicolor in a world of black and white\n\nWhen my heart was locked inside a box, you reached inside\n\nAnd now I see my future when I look into your eyes\n\n\n\nI see it, I see it\n\nI swear I do\n\nI see extraordinary magic in you\n\n\n\nAnd I know that miracles happen\n\nWho cares what they say (mmm-mmm-mmm)\n\n'Cause love's nothin' short of a miracle\n\nHappenin' over and over, every day\n\n\n\nSo I'll keep my eyes open, awed and amazed\n\nAnd if you start to doubt it, I'll remind you of the million ways\n\n\n\nI see it, I see it\n\nI swear I do\n\nI see extraordinary magic in you",
