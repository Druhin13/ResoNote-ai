  "lyrics": "Hey I hear the voice\r\nOf the preacher from the back room\r\nCalling my name and\r\nI follow just to find you\r\nI trace the faith\n\nTo a broken down television\n\nAnd put on the weather\n\n\n\nAnd I've trained myself\n\nTo give up on the past\n\nCause I froze in time\n\nBetween hearses and caskets\n\n\n\nLost control when I\n\nPanicked at the acid test\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nWhile my friends were getting high\n\nAnd chasing girls down parkway lines\n\nI was losing my mind\n\n\n\nBecause the love\n\nThe love, the love\n\nThe love, the love\n\nThe love, that I gave\n\nWasted on a nice face\n\n\n\nIn a blaze of fear\n\nI put a helmet on a helmet\n\nCounting seconds through a night\n\nAnd got carried away\n\n\n\nSo now I'm standing on the overpass\n\nScreaming at the cars, hey\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI didn't know I was lonely\n\nTil I saw your face\n\nI wanna get better\n\nBetter, better, better\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI didn't know I was broken\n\nTil I wanted to change\n\nI wanna get better\n\nBetter, better, better\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI go up to my room\n\nAnd there's girls on the ceiling\n\nCut out their pictures\n\nAnd I chase that feeling\n\nOf an eighteen year old\n\nWho didn't know\n\nWhat loss was\n\nNow I'm a stranger\n\n\n\nAnd I miss the days\n\nOf a life still permanent\n\nMourn the years\n\nBefore I got carried away\n\n\n\nSo now I'm staring at the interstate\n\nScreaming at myself, hey\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI didn't know I was lonely\n\nTil I saw your face\n\nI wanna get better\n\nBetter, better, better\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI didn't know I was broken\n\nTil I wanted to change\n\nI wanna get better\n\nBetter, better, better\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nCause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi\n\nI'm screaming from my bedroom window\n\nEven if it's gonna kill me\n\n\n\nWoke up this morning\n\nEarly before my family\n\nFrom this dream\n\nWhere she was trying to show me\n\n\n\nHow a life\n\nCan move from the darkness\n\nShe said to get better\n\n\n\nSo I put a bullet\n\nWhere I should have put a helmet\n\nAnd I crash my car\n\nCause I wanna get carried away\n\n\n\nThat's why I'm standing on the overpass\n\nScreaming at myself, hey\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI didn't know I was lonely\n\nTil I saw your face\n\nI wanna get better\n\nBetter, better, better\n\nI wanna get better\n\n\n\nI didn't know I was broken\n\nTil I wanted to change\n\nI wanna get better\n\nBetter, better, better\n\nI wanna get better",
