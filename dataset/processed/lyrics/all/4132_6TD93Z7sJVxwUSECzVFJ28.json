Why do I get upset?\r\nTrying to find you, trying to recollect\r\nI, I forget it all\r\nAll of my dreams and every nightmare\r\nAll of my teeth could’ve fallen out my mouth but\r\nI, I forget it all\n\n\n\nSo tell me why I can’t forget you, no\n\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\n\nYou’re getting in my head\n\nAnd getting me upset again\n\nI need a mind eraser\n\n\n\nI used to dip, I did the \"Electric Slide\"\n\nThe \"Macarena\", learned it when I was only nine\n\nAnd I forget it all\n\n\"Down down baby\", and \"Mary Mack\"\n\nI wanna play along but I’m drawing a blank, yeah\n\nI, I forget it all\n\n\n\nSo tell me why I can’t forget you no\n\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\n\nYou’re getting in my head\n\nAnd getting me upset again\n\nI need a mind eraser\n\n\n\nOh my my, mind eraser\n\nOh my my, I need a mind eraser\n\n\n\nI want a way to black it out baby\n\nFind me a way to wash it all away\n\nI want a way to black it out baby\n\nAll you gotta do is slip my mind\n\n\n\nSo tell me why I can’t forget you no\n\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\n\nYou’re getting in my head\n\nAnd getting me upset again\n\nI need a mind eraser\n\nSo tell me why I can’t forget you no\n\nAnd what I gotta do to let you go\n\nYou’re getting in my head\n\nAnd getting me upset again\n\nI need a mind eraser\n\n\n\nMind eraser, mind eraser\n\nMind eraser, mind eraser\n\nMind eraser, mind eraser\n\nMind eraser, mind eraser",
