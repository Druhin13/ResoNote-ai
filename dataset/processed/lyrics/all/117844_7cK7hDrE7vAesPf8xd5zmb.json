  "lyrics": "What if who I hoped to be was always me?\r\nAnd the love I fought to feel was always free?\r\nWhat if all the things I've done, yeah\r\nWere just attempts at earning love? Yeah\r\n'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, stupid deep\n\nWhat if where I've tried to go was always here?\n\nAnd the path I've tried to cut was always clear?\n\nWhy has life become a plan, yeah\n\nTo put some money in my hand?\n\nWhen the love I really need is stupid cheap, stupid cheap\n\n\n\nWhat if who I hoped to be was always me?\n\nAnd the love I fought to feel was always free?\n\nWhat if all the things I've done\n\nWere just attempts at earning love? Yeah\n\n'Cause the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep\n\n\n\nWhat if who I hoped to be was always me?\n\nAnd the love I fought to feel was always free?\n\nWhat if all the things I've done (What if all the things I've done)\n\nWere just attempts at earning love?\n\nThough the hole inside my heart is stupid deep, oh, stupid deep\n\n\n\nDeep",
