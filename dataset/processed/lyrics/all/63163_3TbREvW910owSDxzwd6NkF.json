  "lyrics": "Same old pathways we are walking\r\nNothing ́s ever changed at all\r\nWorld is only shifting color\r\nDay by day, we rise and fall\r\nBuilding up and breaking down\r\nTime of peace and war\n\nCast away and gathering\n\nUntil we reach that shore\n\n\n\nAll you prophets, all you scholars\n\nWaiting for the day to come\n\nScience, progress, we can ́t stop\n\nThe run of things, we ́ll all be gone\n\nThe more we try to find, the less we see\n\nWe ́ll fly to Venus\n\nWe can accelerate the pace of change\n\nBut who will redeem us?\n\n\n\nAll we are\n\nIs an ardent fire\n\nAnd we rise and fall\n\nOur life's desire\n\nAll we are\n\nAs long as we live\n\nAs long as we give\n\nAs long as we try to rise\n\n\n\nLook up (Gain light)\n\nWhy not? (It ́s your life)\n\nIt ́s my faith (It ́s your time)\n\nIt ́s my faith (in you)\n\nWe will follow our ancestors\n\nOn the way to kingdom come\n\n\n\nAll we are\n\nIs an ardent fire\n\nAnd we rise and fall\n\nOur life's desire\n\nAll we are\n\nAs long as we live\n\nAs long as we give\n\nAs long as we try to rise\n\n\n\nAll we are\n\nIs an ardent fire\n\nAnd we rise and fall\n\nOur life's desire\n\nAll we are\n\nAs long as we live\n\nAs long as we give\n\nAs long as we try to rise",
