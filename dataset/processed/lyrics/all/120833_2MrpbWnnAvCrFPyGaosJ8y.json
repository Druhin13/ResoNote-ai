  "lyrics": "They question the king upon leaving\r\nSaid open your eyes when you see\r\nWith her, all the singing came easy\r\nAll go, cut the sun in the evening\r\nBut the birds have stopped singing this season\r\nAlright alright definite scheming\n\nI've never been good at this really\n\nI've started to see the birds need a reason to sing\n\n\n\nI'll be making my way\n\nWalk tall and don't go, we're lonely\n\nCurse of us sinning and healing\n\nI do all of this hoping she'll see me\n\nI envy the sea, have you seething\n\nThe water and all of it breathing\n\nSacred the secrets I'm keeping\n\nHow we danced under circular ceilings\n\nAll the embraces we've been in\n\n\n\nBring back one last time\n\nFor the summers we saw, second guessing and all\n\nYou were all on my mind\n\nI'd love if you call, I'd love if you call\n\nNow I couldn't tell\n\nBut she's keeping me well\n\nAll of my secrets releasing is pieces of me alone\n\nHonestly destined to fail\n\nBut you were all on my mind\n\n'til we made what we are\n\nTill we kissed in the car\n\nNow I couldn't\n\n\n\nAll in, fall in\n\nVulnerable as hell\n\nLet's stall in, crawl in\n\nGirl you knew me well\n\nI like how the forest is leaning\n\n\n\nBring back one last time\n\nFor the summers we saw, second guessing and all\n\nYou were all on my mind\n\nI'd love if you call, I'd love if you call\n\nNow I couldn't tell\n\nBut she's keeping me well\n\nAll of my secrets releasing is pieces of me alone\n\nHonestly destined to fail\n\nBut you were all on my mind\n\n'til we made what we are\n\nTill we kissed in the car\n\nNow I couldn't\n\n\n\nBring back one last time\n\nFor the summers we saw, second guessing and all\n\nYou were all on my mind\n\nI'd love if you call, I'd love if you call\n\nNow I couldn't tell\n\nBut she's keeping me well\n\nAll of my secrets releasing is pieces of me alone\n\nHonestly destined to fail\n\nBut you were all on my mind\n\n'til we made what we are\n\nTill we kissed in the car\n\nNow I couldn't",
