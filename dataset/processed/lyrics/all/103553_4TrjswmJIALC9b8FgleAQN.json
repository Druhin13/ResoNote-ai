  "lyrics": "It comes to fracture vested trust\r\nA love to shatter and turn to rust\r\nI drag my name through waves to wade black water\r\nWallow and drown\r\nA new shade of gray disorients the portrait\n\nRepetitive contusions concuss the allure\n\nCataract eyes and cloudy minds interrupt a perfect design\n\n\n\nCrashing waves come to swallow us\n\nWallow and drown in it\n\nShadows wait to devour us\n\nIt hurts to surrender\n\n\n\nPresentation is everything when you created the play\n\nThe audience hypnotized by the imagery\n\nIn this vicious cycle of disbelief\n\nThat the visionless cannot conceive\n\nYou can drag me down six feet deep\n\nSo I can fight for a life that I threw away\n\nIn this moment of resurgence\n\nClear the dissonance and recover me\n\n\n\nFears suppressed exploit our lust\n\nAnd our memories turn to rust\n\n\n\nAnd when we reach that point, barren of things to say\n\nThere's nothing left to save, do not resuscitate\n\nSwallow your pride, hide what you feel inside\n\nThere are some things that can not be rectified\n\n\n\nCrashing waves come to swallow us\n\nWallow and drown in it\n\nShadows wait to devour us\n\nIt hurts to surrender\n\nLeeches lie in wait, but you're blind to it, but you're blind to it\n\nA void that you create, you give life to it\n\nIt hurts to surrender\n\n\n\nIt comes to fracture vested trust\n\nA love to shatter and turn to rust\n\nIf words could carry my pain through the busy streets and empty alleyways\n\nBe the one who hears my cry like the moon who craves the night\n\n\n\nYou can drag me down six feet deep\n\nSo I can fight for a life that I threw away\n\nIn this moment of resurgence\n\nClear the dissonance and recover me",
