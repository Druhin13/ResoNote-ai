  "lyrics": "You're back in the rain, in over your head\r\nBack in the deep, old things unsaid\r\nBack in the water, you're back in the water\r\nLeaving the last call for your heart\r\nBegging for so long\r\nWon't you come back in the water, back in the water\n\n\n\nThe night fell slowly on our glory days\n\nI lie awake to see you fade away\n\nYou're lost without a trace\n\n\n\nAnd when you're hiding on the water\n\nI'll be waiting till you're ready for my love\n\nWhen you've washed away your sorrow\n\nI'll be right here, till you're ready for the road\n\n\n\n'Cause I will go with you (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\n'Cause I will go with– (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\nI will go with you (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\nI will go with–\n\n\n\nSo tell me your lies and all your fears\n\nWhat took away your faith from here?\n\nBack in the water, back in the water\n\nI'm waiting for so long, won't you hide\n\nTrade in your darkness for the light\n\nBack in the water, back in the water\n\n\n\nThe night fell slowly on our glory days\n\n\n\nAnd when you're hiding on the water\n\nI'll be waiting till you're ready for my love\n\nWhen you've washed away your sorrow\n\nI'll be right here, till you're ready for the road\n\n\n\nI'll be on the watch until it's over\n\nI'll put my back against the door\n\nYour love is easier on the road\n\nNot anymore\n\nI'm feeling the way the song should\n\nI see your dark clouds in the room\n\nI found the stream that pulls you under\n\nNot anymore\n\n\n\n'Cause I will go with you (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\n'Cause I will go with– (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\nI will go with you (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\nTo where you're hiding on the water (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\n'Cause I will go with, I will go with you (wherever you want, let's stay forever)\n\nI will go with",
