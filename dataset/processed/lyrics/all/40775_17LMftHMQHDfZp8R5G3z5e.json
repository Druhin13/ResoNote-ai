  "lyrics": "We set sail at first light\r\nQuesting for steel with power and might\r\nFor countless days we ride the waves\r\nThe battle lies ahead\r\nOur coming they do dread\r\nWe raise the black flag\n\nAnd ready our attack\n\n\n\nFire the cannons, storm the walls\n\nWe will see this city fall\n\nShow no mercy in the fight\n\nThe sky will burn with blood this night\n\n\n\nSet Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands\n\nSet Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands\n\nTo the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side\n\nWe'll sail and conquer 'til we die\n\n\n\nA reign of blood and slaughter\n\nWe show our foes no quarter\n\nTaking their lives and watching them die\n\nWe leave our fears behind\n\nOnly treasure on our minds\n\nFor tonight we raise a hail\n\nIn death or victory\n\n\n\nFire the cannons, storm the walls\n\nWe will see this city fall\n\nShow no mercy in the fight\n\nThe sky will burn with blood this night\n\n\n\nSet Sail and conquer - On a quest to distant lands\n\nSet Sail and conquer - Destiny is in our hands\n\nTo the heart of battle ride - The gods are on our side\n\nWe'll sail and conquer 'til we die",
