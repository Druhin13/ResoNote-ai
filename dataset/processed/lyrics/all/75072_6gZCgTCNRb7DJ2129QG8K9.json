  "lyrics": "I've got a sinking feeling\r\nYour words they have no meaning\r\nYou're not convincing me at all\r\nHidden behind the lies\r\nA thousand alibies\r\nCan't wait for you to take a fall\n\n\n\nWaiting for you to come back down\n\nWaiting for you to hit the ground\n\nNo need for long goodbyes now\n\n\n\nCall me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nCall me\n\nCall me\n\n\n\nThe circus that you run\n\nThe damage that you've done\n\nThe walls you built around you shake\n\n\n\nAnother criminal\n\nReaching the pinnacle\n\nNot sure how much more we can take\n\n\n\nWaiting for you to come back down\n\nWaiting for you to hit the hard ground\n\nNo need for long goodbyes now\n\n\n\nCall me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to\n\n\n\nYou always point the finger\n\nBut you never pull the trigger\n\nYou feel contempt for those you serve\n\n\n\nCan't break a heart of stone\n\nI hope you die alone\n\nYou're gonna get what you deserve\n\n\n\nWaiting for you to come back down\n\nWaiting for you to hit the cold hard ground\n\nNo need for long goodbyes now\n\n\n\nCall me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nYou don't need to call me\n\nCall me\n\nCall me",
