  "lyrics": "Do you remember how it was?\r\nDo you remember who I am?\r\nDo you take the time to think of what we had?\r\nHave you left it on a shelf\r\n'Cause I'd be lying if I said\r\nIt don't ever cross my mind\n\nHow we loved like no one watched us\n\nAnd how we laughed until we cried\n\n\n\nIf only it was simple, baby\n\nI would turn back time\n\nBut it's complicated, I can't make you mine\n\nSo, now he takes all your time\n\n\n\nBut does he love you like I used to?\n\nDoes he know the things that I knew?\n\nHow you loved the rain and Tennessee on ice\n\nIf I could only change the moment\n\nWould you let me fix what's broken?\n\nI just hope and pray I'm sometimes on your mind\n\nSo am I ever on your mind?\n\n\n\nI've been tryna pass the time\n\nWatch the hands up on the wall\n\nBut the pictures down the hallway\n\nAre the anchors holding on and on and on and on\n\n\n\nMaybe it's stupid, but I just can't hold my tongue\n\nMy heart's still breaking, why you just move on?\n\n\n\nDoes he love you like I used to?\n\nDoes he know the things that I knew?\n\nHow you loved the rain and Tennessee on ice\n\nIf I could only change the moment\n\nWould you let me fix what's broken?\n\nI just hope and pray I'm sometimes on your mind\n\nSo am I ever on your mind?\n\n\n\nBut does he love you like I used to?\n\nDoes he know the things that I do?\n\nHow you loved the rain and Tennessee on ice\n\nI could only change the moment\n\nWould you let me fix what's broken?\n\nI just hope and pray I'm sometimes on your mind\n\nSo am I ever on your mind?\n\nAm I ever on your mind?\n\nAm I ever on your mind?",
