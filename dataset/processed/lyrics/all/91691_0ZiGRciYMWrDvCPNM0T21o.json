  "lyrics": "Last night got a little bad\r\nI said some things I shouldn't have\r\nI wanna make it up to you\r\nHow can I prove I'm on track?\r\n(you're / your) storming out of my room's\n\nThe only way I can picture you\n\nAnd it's been 48 hours, you've made your point now\n\nSo come back\n\n\n\nSorry I know that comment wasn't funny\n\nJust wanted you to love me\n\nBut I didn't go about it right\n\nSometimes the best advice that I can give\n\nIs to bite my lip and listen\n\nWith my big fat mouth shut tight\n\nAnd now I think I still can smell you on me\n\nEven after doing laundry\n\nBut it might be in my head\n\nAnd would you still stay mad at me forever\n\nIf we just had each other\n\nIt was all that we had left?\n\n\n\nTry to fit my feet in your shoes\n\nI see that I can't have your love and eat/need it too\n\nBut it's been 48 hours, enough of this now\n\nI need you\n\n\n\nSorry I know I tend to go too far\n\nMaking everything an argument\n\nI didn't mean to make you cry\n\nSometimes the best advice that I can give\n\nIs to bite my lip and listen\n\nWith my big fat mouth shut tight\n\nAnd now I think I still can smell you on me\n\nEven after doing laundry\n\nBut it might be in my head\n\nAnd would you still stay mad at me forever\n\nIf we just had each other\n\nIt was all that we had left?\n\n\n\nOh what if Jesus left without us\n\nAnd we just didn't notice\n\nWhen he took up all our friends?\n\nWhat if the Lord came back and left without us\n\nAnd we just didn't notice\n\nSo we're stuck here till the end of the world?\n\nTo the end of the world\n\nTo the end of the world\n\nTo the end of the world",
