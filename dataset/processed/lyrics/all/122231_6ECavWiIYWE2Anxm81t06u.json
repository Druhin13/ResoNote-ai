  "lyrics": "Lord knows I ain't no saint\r\nAnd I only dress up on Sunday\r\nAnd on Friday night the devil's in my veins\r\nWhile the quarters in my pocket make the jukebox sing\r\nA lonesome song on how I lost my way\r\nDown a one lane path, nobody paved my way\n\nHad a lotta good times and a few heartbreaks\n\nI've always been a sinner, never claimed to be a saint\n\n\n\nAin't always been the guy that I am today\n\nMe and Drew used to break in the Mustangs\n\nIn the middle of the night in Kingston springs\n\nThen karma come around and crossed my way\n\nGrandpaw passed I got a little wild\n\nStarted inking up my body every check I got\n\nJust sitting in the barn with the lights cut off\n\nWondering where I'd end up in the 4 years time\n\nAnd I dropped out of school 'cause it weren't for me\n\nMy senior year I was slinging them drywall sheets\n\nStarting up that truck about 5 in the morning\n\nBusting ass every day in the Tennessee sun\n\nTalk about that dream seemed out of reach\n\nFor a piece of shit whole sinner like me\n\nThank God that he put me on my own two feet\n\nThat's why I play before I go to sleep\n\n\n\nLord knows I ain't no saint\n\nAnd I only dress up on Sunday\n\nAnd on Friday night the devil's in my veins\n\nWhile the quarters in my pocket make the jukebox sing\n\nA lonesome song on how I lost my way\n\nDown a one lane path, nobody paved my way\n\nHad a lotta good times and a few heartbreaks\n\nI've always been a sinner, never claimed to be a saint\n\n\n\nWell I spent a many night in the county jail\n\nDown on my luck and drunk as hell\n\nNobody accepted my calls\n\nNobody is paying my bail\n\nWell I had to swallow my pride\n\nPick myself up and look inside\n\nFacing life eye to eye\n\nI swear to God this my last time\n\nSomething deep down kept calling me\n\nHolding me and I wanna be\n\nBetter than the man I used to be\n\nAnd I wanna give it all to me\n\nAin't nobody ever paved my way\n\nAnd the Lord knows I ain't ever been a saint\n\nHe guards my soul every day\n\nAnd I gotta give him thanks for these better days\n\n\n\nLord knows I ain't no saint\n\nAnd I only dress up on Sunday\n\nAnd on Friday night the devil's in my veins\n\nWhile the quarters in my pocket make the jukebox sing\n\nA lonesome song on how I lost my way\n\nDown a one lane path, nobody paved my way\n\nHad a lotta good times and a few heartbreaks\n\nI've always been a sinner, never claimed to be a saint",
