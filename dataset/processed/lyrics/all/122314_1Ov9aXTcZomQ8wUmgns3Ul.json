  "lyrics": "You can try to wrap your words like rocks around my ankles\r\nAnd push me off a bridge in hope that I might drown\r\nAny cheap shots that you got, yeah, I can handle\r\nYou don't get this far without knowing how to get up off the ground\r\nSo I turn up a cold one, and I turn up the volume\n\nUnlaugh, unlove, on the way I feel right now\n\nYeah, I learned how to let go, and how to take the high road\n\nI'm on another level, you can't bring me down\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na\n\n\n\nI'll be the first to say I've made some bad decisions\n\nI been a little quick to call the kettle black\n\nBut it's true what they say about forgiveness\n\nAnd once you find a man, there ain't nothing that can hold you back\n\n\n\nSo I turn up a cold one, and I turn up the volume\n\nUnlaugh, unlove, on the way I feel right now\n\nYeah, I learned how to let go, and how to take the high road\n\nI'm on another level, you can't bring me down\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na, yeah\n\n\n\nThere ain't nothing like the way my baby holds me\n\nThere ain't nothing like this sweet piece that I've found\n\nIt takes off all the shackles, so save yourself the battle\n\nYeah, ha, you can't bring me down\n\n\n\nSo I turn up a cold one, and I turn up the volume\n\nUnlaugh, unlove, on the way I feel right now\n\nYeah, I learned how to let go, and how to take the high road\n\nI'm on another level, you can't bring me down\n\nYeah, I learned how to let go, and how to take the high road\n\nI'm on another level, no, you can't bring me down\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na, ha\n\nNa na na na na na\n\nNa na na na na na, yeah\n\n\n\nAw, turn it up",
