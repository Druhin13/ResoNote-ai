  "lyrics": "She leaves her parents' house around midnight\r\nMeets her best mate at the shop buy some cheap wine\r\nAnd go to space, see the Milky Way\r\nGet away from the teenage everyday cliche pressure\r\nAbsent on absinthe, dancing to bad synths\r\nSaturday night ain't about romancing anymore\n\nJust you getting lit in the queue to the dance floor\n\n\n\nToo many blokes are getting heavy\n\nWhen a girl looks unsteady\n\nBlisters on your bleeding soles\n\n\"Here have my boots, I'll walk you home\"\n\nHe walks her straight up to the front door\n\nAs she stumbles on the floor\n\nWe all know what happens next\n\nA bit of fun turns to regret\n\n\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no\n\nLeave it alone mate, leave it alone mate, leave it alone mate\n\n\n\nDaylight wakes her up the next morning\n\nA foreign room where the sheets are blue, and not white\n\nNo scented candles in sight\n\nJust a stranger on his side, says, \"Cheers love for last night\"\n\nGot to go forensic, avoid the domestic\n\nGet antiseptic and give him the polygraph eyes\n\nTurn your head to the side and lie to the real life\n\n\n\nSee this girl, she had a boyfriend\n\nHis name was Zach and he made her happy\n\nBut he couldn't understand\n\nIn his mind, she was a slag (a fucking slag)\n\nWhen she tried to explain what happened\n\nShe was shouting at him for an hour\n\nCrying at the top her lungs\n\n\"Don't leave me here, you're the one I love\"\n\n\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya\n\n\n\nShe can't even run, she can't even walk\n\nShe slurs when she speaks\n\nBut you hear what you want when she can't even talk\n\nShe can't even run, she can't even walk\n\nShe slurs when she speaks\n\nBut you hear what you want when she can't even talk\n\nCan't even talk, can't even talk\n\n(Can't even talk, can't even talk)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya, no\n\nLeave it alone, mate\n\nShe doesn't want to go home with ya, home with ya\n\n\n\n(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even run\n\n(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even walk\n\nShe slurs when she speaks\n\nBut you hear what you want when she can't even talk\n\n(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even run\n\n(Leave it alone, mate) She can't even walk\n\nShe slurs when she speaks\n\nBut you hear what you want when she can't even talk",
