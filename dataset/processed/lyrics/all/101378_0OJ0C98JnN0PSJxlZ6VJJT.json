  "lyrics": "In the corner, I can see him standing there\r\nIn the jacket and ripped jeans you used to wear\r\nThis is crazy, can't escape you\r\nI just can't seem to erase you\r\nSo I undress just to cover up the pain\r\nBut it's useless\n\nAll the layers are the same\n\nIt's ironic that I do this\n\nI don't miss you, but the truth is\n\n\n\nThat he felt like you\n\nAnd he kissed like you\n\nYeah he walks like you, talks like you\n\nJust like you\n\nAnd for a second, it was like I was touched by you\n\nTouched by you\n\n\n\nAin't it funny how the thought of you now makes me numb?\n\nYet you haunt me when I just wanna have some fun\n\nBusy trying to replace you with this boy I can't relate to\n\nIn his bedroom, I can smell you on the sheets\n\nYour favourite perfume\n\nI guess it brought back memories\n\nI admit I'm going through it\n\nClose my eyes, because the truth is\n\n\n\nThat he looks like you\n\n(He looks like you)\n\nAnd he tastes like you\n\n(He tastes like you)\n\nYeah he walks like you, talks like you\n\nJust like you\n\nAnd for a second, it was like I was touched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nTouched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nYes, you know that he held me like you\n\n(Held me like you)\n\nWith his hands like you\n\n(Hands like you)\n\nMade me laugh like you, laugh like you\n\nFelt like you\n\nAnd for a second, if only for a second\n\nIt was like I was touched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nTouched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\n(Touched by you)\n\n\n\nAnd it felt like\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nThat's what it felt like\n\nFor a second\n\nIt was like I was touched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nTouched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nIt was like I was touched by you\n\n(Touched by you)\n\nBaby, it's like I felt you on my skin once again\n\nFor a second\n\nIt was like I was touched by you\n\nTouched by you\n\nUnderstood?",
