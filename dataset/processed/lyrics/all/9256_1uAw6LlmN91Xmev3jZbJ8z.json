  "lyrics": "Everyday I wake up with my back against the wall\r\nAnytime you get up someone wants to see you fall\r\nIf you're afraid to lose it all, you're never gonna win\r\nI'll be giving you the finger\r\nSticking out my chin\r\nBoom, boom, boom\n\nHere comes the boom, boom, boom\n\n\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nMy time is right now\n\nTurning your lights out\n\nI'm throwing down\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nUntil the last round\n\nI'm throwing down\n\nGo start a fire, go start a fight\n\nNo regrets, this is your life\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nMy time is right now\n\nI'm throwing down\n\n\n\nAre you living in a nightmare\n\nAre you living in a dream?\n\nDo you stand for something\n\nWill you fall for anything\n\nIt's easier to count me out but you can count me in\n\nCause I'm giving you the finger\n\nSticking out my chin\n\nBoom, boom, boom\n\nHere comes the boom, boom, boom\n\n\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nMy time is right now\n\nTurning your lights out\n\nI'm throwing down\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nUntil the last round\n\nI'm throwing down\n\nGo start a fire, go start a fight\n\nNo regrets, this is your life\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nMy time is right now\n\nI'm throwing down, down, down\n\nDown, down\n\nThrowing down, down, down\n\nDown, down\n\n\n\nDid you really live your life\n\nOr did it pass you by?\n\nWhat's it take to tell yourself\n\nYou really were alive\n\nLook me in the eye\n\n\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nMy time is right now\n\nTurning your lights out\n\nI'm throwing down\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nUntil the last round\n\nI'm throwing down\n\nGo start a fire, go start a fight\n\nNo regrets, this is your life\n\nHere comes the knockout\n\nMy time is right now\n\nI'm throwing down",
