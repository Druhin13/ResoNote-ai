  "lyrics": "If I could love you in the right way\r\nI wouldn't let you down before I go\r\nI woke up in a black haze\r\nTomorrow I'll be plowing through the snow\r\nYour heart is strong, yeah, your back is made of gold\n\nThese lies don't work and these ties are getting old\n\n\n\nCan I put you in my pocket and save you for later?\n\nCause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor\n\nCan I put you in my pocket and save you for later?\n\nCause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker\n\nYou're my troublemaker\n\nYou're my troublemaker\n\n\n\nI chased you for a lifetime\n\nIf you leave me with a thrill I can't contain\n\nWith emptiness by my side\n\nI'll always have a place to hide the pain\n\n\n\nYour heart is strong, yeah, your back is made of gold\n\nThese lies don't work and these ties are getting old\n\n\n\nCan I put you in my pocket and save you for later?\n\nCause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor\n\nCan I put you in my pocket and save you for later?\n\nCause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker\n\nYou're my troublemaker\n\nYou're my troublemaker\n\n\n\nThe trouble in you is the trouble in me\n\nThe trouble in you is the trouble in me\n\nI know it's trouble, I love it; if you give it, I take it\n\nCause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker\n\n\n\nCan I put you in my pocket and save you for later?\n\nCause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor\n\nGonna put you in my pocket and save you for later\n\nCause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker\n\nCan I put you in my pocket and save you for later?\n\nCause you're too good to lose; you're the flavor I savor\n\nGonna put you in my pocket and save you for later\n\nCause you're the trouble I want, you're my troublemaker",
