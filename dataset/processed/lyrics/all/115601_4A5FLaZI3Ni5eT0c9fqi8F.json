  "lyrics": "If you see me floatin' too many times\r\nMy face will be painted in these white brick lines\r\n'Cause all my fear's invading\r\nAll the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you\r\nLivin' on the limits\n\n\n\nAnd if you say goodbye too many times\n\nThe sentinels will find me and switch me off this time\n\n\n\n'Cause all my fear's invading\n\nAll the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you\n\nLivin' on the limits\n\n\n\nAll you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fallen man\n\nEvery calling cost made to your heart\n\nYou were in the kind of game that put the force in me\n\nI was ever chasing fireflies\n\n\n\nSometimes I follow a firefly\n\nIt takes me into the night\n\nBaby, I just survive\n\nI got drunk, I'm sorry\n\nAm I losing you?\n\nSometimes I follow a firefly\n\nIt takes me into the night\n\nBaby, I just survive\n\nI got drunk, I'm sorry\n\nAm I losing you?\n\n\n\nAll you ever get from the sonnet is the count of the fallen man\n\nEvery calling cost made to your heart\n\nYou were in the kind of game that put the force in me\n\nI was ever chasing fireflies",
