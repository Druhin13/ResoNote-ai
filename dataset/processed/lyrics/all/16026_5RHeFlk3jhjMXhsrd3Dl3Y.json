  "lyrics": "It is the end of all hope\r\nTo lose the child, the faith\r\nTo end all the innocence\r\nTo be someone like me\r\nThis is the birth of all hope\r\nTo have what I once had\n\nThis life unforgiven\n\nIt will end with a birth\n\n\n\nNo will to wake for this morn\n\nTo see another black rose born\n\nDeathbed is slowly covered with snow\n\n\n\nAngels, they fell first but I'm still here\n\nAlone as they are drawing near\n\nIn heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung\n\n\n\nWounded is the deer that leaps highest\n\nAnd my wound it cuts so deep\n\nTurn off the light and let me pull the plug\n\n\n\nMandylion without a face\n\nDeathwish without a prayer\n\nEnd of hope\n\nEnd of love\n\nEnd of time\n\nThe rest is silence",
