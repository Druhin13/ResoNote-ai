  "lyrics": "I hope that you don't think I'm rude\r\nBut I wanna make out with you\r\nAnd I'm a little awkward, sure\r\nBut I could touch my face to yours, oh\r\nAnd no one ever called me smooth\r\nBut I just wanna see the grooves between your hands, your teeth, oh\n\nTell me, do you think about me?\n\n\n\nI just wanna kiss you\n\nAnd even if I miss you\n\nAt least I'll know what it's like to have held your hand, oh!\n\nNo-o, hey!\n\n\n\nBad ideas, ay (oh!)\n\nI know where they lead (hey, oh!)\n\nBut I got too many to sleep\n\nAnd I can't get enough, no\n\nI wanna kiss you standing up\n\nOh, no!\n\nAnd if tomorrow makes me low (no!)\n\nWell it'd be worth it just to know\n\n'Cause I can't get enough, no\n\nI wanna kiss you standing up\n\nO-oh!\n\nHey!\n\n\n\nI don't know what compels me\n\nTo do the very thing that fells me\n\nI wake up, still high on you\n\nBut by the night, I'm crashing through\n\n\n\nSo why I'd wanna kiss you\n\nEven though I miss you\n\nGuess I just want to know what it would feel like, oh!\n\nNo-o, hey!\n\n\n\nBad ideas, ay (oh!)\n\nI know where they lead (hey, oh!)\n\nBut I got too many to sleep\n\nAnd I can't get enough, no\n\nI wanna kiss you standing up\n\nOh, no!\n\nAnd if tomorrow makes me low (no!)\n\nWell it'd be worth it just to know\n\n'Cause I can't get enough, no\n\nI wanna kiss you standing up\n\nOh!\n\n\n\nFlirting's a bad look on me\n\nAnd if I'm talking honestly\n\nIt takes everything I got not to text, and\n\nI just want a kiss to get me through\n\n'Cause now all my bed-sheets smell like you, so\n\n\n\nIf you think you miss me\n\nCome on back and kiss me\n\nI just gotta know what you and I would feel like, oh!\n\nNo-o, hey!\n\nYikes\n\n\n\nBad ideas, ay (oh!)\n\nI know where they lead (hey, oh!)\n\nBut I got too many to sleep\n\nAnd I can't get enough, no\n\nI wanna kiss you standing up\n\nOh, no!\n\nAnd if tomorrow makes me low (no!)\n\nWell it'd be worth it just to know\n\n'Cause I can't get enough, no-o\n\nI wanna kiss you standing up",
