  "lyrics": "You said \"I love you\" to me\r\nI don't know what that means\r\nSo frozen my feet\r\nPeople use it too carelessly\r\nAnd I couldn’t believe\r\nThat you would dive in so deep\n\nAnd you said perfectly\n\nEverything I’ve been feeling for you, and about you\n\nIt’s time to break the chains that held me back from you\n\n\n\nSo come on and\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, I literally don't mind\n\nJust please don't misplace it\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, baby be mine now\n\nBaby, be mine now\n\nMaybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line\n\n\n\nWell I was never the type\n\nTo put it all on the line\n\nBut I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes\n\nIt was the way that the light\n\nPicked you out of that night\n\nThen you were right by my side\n\nPut a soul in my body\n\nAnd now it’s time to close the space between the two of us\n\n\n\nSo come on and\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, I literally don't mind\n\nJust please don't misplace it\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, baby be mine now\n\nBaby, be mine now\n\nMaybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line\n\n\n\nOh baby it's time\n\nOh it's time\n\n\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, I literally don't mind\n\nJust please don't misplace it\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, baby be mine now\n\nBaby, be mine now\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, I literally don't mind\n\nJust please don't misplace it\n\nTake a little bit of my\n\nHeart tonight\n\nNo, baby be mine now\n\nBaby, be mine now\n\n\n\nMaybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line\n\nPut our hearts in a parallel line\n\nPut our hearts in a parallel line",
