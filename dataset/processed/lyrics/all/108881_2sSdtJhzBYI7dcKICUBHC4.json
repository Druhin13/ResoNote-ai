  "lyrics": "To care, or not to care\r\nTo be there\r\nIn the distant and uncertain\r\nTo be aware\r\nIn an old Iberian hotel room\r\nThat the devil\n\nIs not behind the curtain\n\nShe said walk in small steps\n\nAnd fear floating\n\nWe made a pact\n\nAs Saturn approaching\n\nLeaned on the sky\n\nThe smoking cigarette\n\nSaid it's late\n\nYou should be going\n\nThe wind is howling\n\nThe house is showing\n\n\n\nBoat to an island on the wall\n\nA Hand striking in slow motion\n\nFuture singing in the field\n\nShooting season's open\n\n\n\nTo care, or not care\n\nTo be your world\n\nIn your absence they made your choices for you\n\nYou're supposed to laugh\n\nTell your fortune to the sailor\n\nThis is the black mountain pass\n\nThese hours the sun shines to moonlight, black\n\n\n\nBoat to an island on the wall\n\nA hand striking in slow motion\n\nFuture singing in the field\n\nShooting season's open\n\nBoat to an island on the wall\n\nA hand striking in slow motion\n\nLied too bad, too long\n\nShooting season's open",
