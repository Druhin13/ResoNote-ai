  "lyrics": "You don't have to be so cautious\r\nIf you practice what you preach\r\nCounting up the stacks on the counter\r\nA fucking (disease)\r\nDon't ask me to be righteous\r\nIf you practice what you teach\n\nCounting all your blessings the second you're down on your knees\n\n\n\nSo why, why?\n\nDon't we get a little high, high?\n\n\n\nDon't we get a little–\n\nGet a little–\n\nDon't we get a little high\n\nGet a little high, high\n\n\n\nKeep my head under the water\n\nPride buried in my chest\n\nNot counting all the minutes, the seconds\n\nNot holdin' my (breath)\n\nNow sinking from the surface\n\nSwimming in my lungs\n\nLosing all my vision, religion\n\nI'm holding my tongue\n\n\n\nSo why, why?\n\nDon't we get a little high, high?\n\n\n\nDon't we get a little–\n\nGet a little–\n\nDon't we get a little high\n\nGet a little high\n\n\n\nDon't want to pay attention to the writing on the wall\n\nPainted with aggression, and dripping when you call\n\nNot gonna learn my lesson\n\nAm I running out of time?\n\nSo, why?\n\nWhy?\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nDon't we get a little–\n\nGet a little–\n\nDon't we get a little high\n\nGet a little high",
