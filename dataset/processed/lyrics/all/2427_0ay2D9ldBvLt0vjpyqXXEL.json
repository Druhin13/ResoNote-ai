  "lyrics": "I was walking outside in the moonlight\r\nAt the church on the ground that nobody know\r\nWhen I hear it in your voice for the first time\r\nI was staring at the light through the window\r\nI was waking up early, feeling undone\r\nI was crying outside on the front lawn\n\nBut you call me with no hesitation\n\nAnd you love me with no reservation\n\n\n\nYou touch me like an angel\n\nBut you kiss me like a sinner\n\nGot me dying for a miracle\n\nBaby step into the holy water\n\n\n\nTied to your finger like an anchor\n\nEvery second go a little deeper\n\nHold my breath, keep getting out\n\nHold my breath, don’t let it stop\n\nI was up all night feeling messed up\n\nGot a couple bad days I’m ashamed of\n\nBut you call me when you’re thinking too much\n\nHold me back, I get up\n\n\n\nYou touch me like an angel\n\nBut you kiss me like a sinner\n\nGot me dying for a miracle\n\nBaby step into the holy water\n\nYou touch me like an angel\n\nBut you kiss me like a sinner\n\nGot me dying for a miracle\n\nBaby step into the holy water\n\n\n\nIf there's something I do, change it\n\nI just wanna be the one remaining\n\nAnd I’ll take my chance cause I know you got a wild heart\n\nBut I’ve loved you from the start\n\nI’ll love you like you want it to end\n\nI’ll love so deep they won’t understand\n\nHow could I stop when I know what it feels like\n\nYeah, I find myself so alive with your holy light\n\n\n\nYou touch me like an angel\n\nBut you kiss me like a sinner\n\nGot me dying for a miracle\n\nBaby step into the holy water (step into the holy water)\n\nYou touch me like an angel (touch me like an angel)\n\nBut you kiss me like a sinner (kiss me like a sinner)\n\nGot me dying for a miracle\n\nBaby step into the holy water (step into the holy water)",
