  "lyrics": "Out of the corner of my eye\r\nCaught you walk by\r\nI chase you down\r\nIs it ok if I call you mine\r\nFrom here on out\n\nAs if I could ever stop\n\n\n\nYou are light as a butterfly\n\nAs heavy as a rock\n\n[?] the towel\n\n\n\nIs it ok if I call you mine\n\nFrom here on out\n\nAs if I could ever stop\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm opened up\n\nI'm strong I'm wild\n\nLike a storm out the stars\n\nIn my blood\n\nAnd it's all because of you\n\nYou, my love\n\n\n\nIs it ok if I call you mine\n\nFrom here on out\n\nAs if I could ever stop\n\n\n\nWhen you laugh, it's like a lie\n\nTo fill me up\n\n'Cause you are my love\n\nAnd when I fell into your eyes\n\nI could not get out\n\nAnd I could not get enough\n\n\n\nIs it ok if I call you mine\n\nFrom here on out\n\nAs if I could ever stop\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm opened up\n\nI'm strong I'm wild\n\nLike a storm out the stars\n\nIn my blood\n\nAnd it's all because of you\n\nYou are my love\n\n\n\nIs it ok if I call you mine\n\nFrom here on out\n\nAs if I could ever stop\n\n\n\nAnd I want you to know\n\nI still need you so\n\nI want you to know\n\nAnd I still need you so\n\n\n\nIs it ok if I call you mine\n\nFrom here on out\n\nAs if I could ever stop",
