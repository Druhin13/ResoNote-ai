  "lyrics": "I do admit, I've come to like the attention\r\nThe heavy look in your eyes\r\nSo break a piece off of my latest obsession\r\nA taste of pure paradise\r\nI like the buzz deep 'cause of what it does to me\n\nI get a fuzzy feeling washing over me\n\nI get a rush now honey when you're touching me\n\nIs it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?\n\n\n\nI can't sleep, I can't think now\n\nI can't breathe without you\n\nTouching me, is it love or the drugs?\n\nIt's a buzz, buzz, buzz\n\n(I like it, I like it)\n\n\n\nEverybody's keeping their little secrets\n\nHidden in the bottom drawer\n\nBut when it's over there's a terrible fever\n\nThat keeps you begging for more\n\n\n\nI like the buzz deep 'cause of what it does to me\n\nI get a fuzzy feeling washing over me\n\nI get a rush now honey when you're touching me\n\nIs it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?\n\n\n\nI can't sleep, I can't think now\n\nI can't breathe without you\n\nTouching me, is it love or the drugs?\n\nIt's a buzz, buzz, buzz\n\nOh yeah (I like it)\n\nWhat you're doing to me (I like it)\n\nOh yeah (I like it)\n\nSay, what you're doing to me\n\n\n\n'Cause there's a new drug, baby, that I can't resist\n\nIt's like a thousand buzzing when we kiss\n\nAnd can you show me now, how can I get my fix?\n\nIs it love? Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?\n\n\n\nIs it love? Is it love?\n\nOr just the drugs pulsating my veins?\n\nIs it love? Is it love?\n\nOr just a buzz running to my brain?\n\nI can't sleep, I can't think now\n\nI can't breathe without you\n\nTouching me, is it love or the drugs?\n\nIt's a buzz, buzz, buzz\n\n(I can't sleep\n\nI can't breathe)\n\nIt's a buzz, buzz, buzz\n\n\n\n(I like it)",
