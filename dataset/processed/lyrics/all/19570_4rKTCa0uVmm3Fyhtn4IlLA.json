  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Blood In The Cut par K.Flay\r\nThe boy I love’s got another girl\nHe might be fucking her right now\nI don’t have an apartment\nThought if I was smart I’d make it far\nBut I’m still at the start\nGuess I’m contagious it’d be safest if you ran\nFuck that’s what they all just end up doing in the end\nTake my car and paint it black\nTake my arm, break it in half\nSay something, do it soon\nIt’s too quiet in this room\n\nI need noise\nI need the buzz of a sub\n\nNeed the crack of a whip\nNeed some blood in the cut\nMet back up with the boy I love\nCried on the streets of San Francisco\nI don’t have an agenda\nAll I do is pretend to be ok so my friends\nCan’t see my heart in the blender\nLately, I’ve been killing all my time\nReading through your messages my favorite way to die\nTake my head and kick it in\nBreak some bread for all my sins\nSay a word, do it soon\nIt’s too quiet in this room\n\nI need noise\nI need the buzz of a sub\nNeed the crack of a whip\n\nNeed some blood in the cut",
