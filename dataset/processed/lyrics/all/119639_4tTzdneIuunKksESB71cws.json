  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Play Me Like A Violin par Stephen\r\nThis fire in my head's got me on edge\nI'm going out tonight\nFaded on a thread, don't know what's next\nI wanna feel alive\n\nI kissed a stranger in a white dress\nShe put a crown on top of my head\nSaid every king needs a queen in his bed\n\nI said, hey girl, hey girl\nI'd like to stay here for a while\nJust you and I\nFar from the places we can't get away from\n\nShe said, hey boy, hey boy\nI like your style\n\nI'll let you play me for a while\nPlay me 'till the sun rises\nPlay me like a violin\n\nI'm here with you now, not coming down\nLeave my insanity\nUp here in the clouds, look what we found\nOxygen, we can breathe\n\nLet the madness slowly undress\nRip the mask off over our heads\nWe can dive down deeper instead\n\nI said, hey girl, hey girl\nI'd like to stay here for a while\nJust you and I\nFar from the places we can't get away from\n\n\nShe said, hey boy, hey boy\nI like your style\nI'll let you play me for a while\nPlay me 'till the sun rises\nPlay me like a violin\n\nPlay me 'till the sun rises\nPlay me 'till your hands give in\nPlay me like a violin\n\nPlay me 'till the sun rises\nPlay me 'till you can't hide it\nPlay me like a violin\n\nPlay me 'till the sun rises\nPlay me 'till your hands give in\nPlay me like a violin\n\n\nPlay me 'till the sun rises\nPlay me 'till you can't hide it\nPlay me like a violin",
