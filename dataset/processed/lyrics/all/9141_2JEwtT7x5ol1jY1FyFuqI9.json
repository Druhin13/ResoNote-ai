  "lyrics": "I never felt like I was home\r\nFelt like a strange long-distance caller\r\nSet to the words I heard on the needle spinnin' by my bedside\r\nAnd I used to stay up most of the night\r\nWith my ear tuned to any sign\r\nOf life, of love, of something that felt like redemption\n\n\n\nAnd I never dreamed that I would see you again\n\nBut I never forgot all the times that we spent flying rolled down low like the window\n\n\n\nAnd maybe we believed in very, very foolish things\n\nMaybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow\n\nAnd we were always very sure we were never gonna change the world\n\nI never held any grudges or kept any pictures\n\n\n\nAnd what did it mean for all these years I spent chasin them ferris wheels\n\nThat were always gone like visions come the morning?\n\nBut there's not one day I regret\n\nAnd I would do it all again\n\nSo if I go down, Lily, I'm going down believing\n\n\n\nAnd I never dreamed that I would see you again\n\nAnd I lost myself for a season in Hell flying rolled down low like the window\n\n\n\nAnd maybe we believed in very, very foolish things\n\nMaybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow\n\nAnd we were always very sure we were never gonna change the world\n\nI never held any grudges or kept any pictures\n\n(Hey!)\n\n\n\nShe said, \"tonight, my love, I declare this war for your falling from grace with me\"\n\nWhile Neptune rolled out a carpet made of gold for the mermaids he drowned in the sea\n\nIt's been a long time since I kept any pictures\n\nAnd it's been a long night, I don't know where to find her\n\n\n\nAnd maybe we believed in very, very foolish things\n\nMaybe these songs kept us breathing another tomorrow\n\nAnd we were always very sure we were never gonna change the world\n\nI never held any grudges or kept any pictures\n\n\n\n(It's been a long time\n\nSince I kept any pictures\n\nIt's been a long night\n\nAnd I don't know where to find her) x2",
