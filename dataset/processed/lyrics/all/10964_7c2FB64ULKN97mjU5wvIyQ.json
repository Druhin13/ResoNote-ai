  "lyrics": "Sometimes I make choices\r\nSometimes they make me\r\nLonesome distance between here\r\nAnd where you think I should be\r\nSomeday we may look back and laugh\r\nAt all that could've been\n\nBut tonight the bottle wins again\n\nBroken hearts and broken dreams\n\nTurns out they weigh the same\n\nPassed down through generations\n\nLike the family name\n\nThere's a gilded coat of arms\n\nFor those who heal from within\n\nBut tonight the bottle wins again\n\nSo meet me in an hour\n\nWe'll have just one or two\n\nYou pretend to listen\n\nI'll act like I can hear you\n\nI know you'll always be there\n\nAin't that a true friend\n\nTonight the bottle wins again",
