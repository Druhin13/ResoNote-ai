  "lyrics": "A fantasy awakes, a dark desire to\r\nWatch you slip away into oblivion\r\nI can't wait to see your flesh turn pale\r\nWhen I hear the last breath you take fail\r\nEven with you dead, I still feel the pain\n\nIn my heart, things will never be the same\n\nNow I must live out this dark fantasy\n\nI am not the man I came to be\n\n\n\nShould I feel this way I'm not supposed to\n\nI can't find it in me to care at all\n\nIt's a shame we don't see eye to eye\n\nThat's why I am here to take your life\n\n\n\nEven with you dead, I still feel the pain\n\nIn my heart, things will never be the same\n\nNow I must live out this dark fantasy\n\nI am not the man I came to be\n\n\n\nSerenity never felt so empty\n\nSanity never came back to me\n\nI'm not stable\n\nI'm not stable\n\nI'm not stable\n\nI'm not stable\n\n\n\nEven with you dead, I still feel the pain\n\nIn my heart, things will never be the same\n\nNow I must live out this dark fantasy\n\nI am not the man I came to be",
