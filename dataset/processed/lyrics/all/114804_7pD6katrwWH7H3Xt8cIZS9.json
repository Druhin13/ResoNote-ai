  "lyrics": "Read my fortune too\r\nTell me what you see\r\nCross it like a T\r\nIt's all the same to me\r\nThis game I play, I do it every day\r\nI promise I'll be fine\n\nBear it every time\n\n\n\nWhen you turn the lights down low\n\nLemon color, honey glow\n\n\n\nSee this state I'm in\n\nIs crawling in my skin\n\nFevers took me back\n\nAnd turned me inside out\n\n\n\nWhen you turn the lights down low\n\nLemon color, honey glow\n\n\n\nIt's what you do\n\nThis pulls me through\n\nTo the other end\n\nWhere it begins\n\nYou see through me\n\nStill, it's coming back\n\nI come alive\n\nYou stay all night\n\n\n\nFeel it coming right through you\n\nThe color of your mind\n\nThe color of your mind\n\nThe color of your mind\n\nYou feel it coming right through you\n\nYou feel it coming right through you\n\nIt's on the other side\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way\n\nThe color of your mind\n\n\n\nIt's what you do\n\nThis pulls me through\n\nI come alive\n\nYou stay all night\n\nIt's what you do\n\nThis pulls me through\n\nI come alive\n\nYou stay all night\n\n\n\nCandy-colored mystery\n\nThe color of your mind",
