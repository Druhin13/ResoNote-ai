  "lyrics": "We choose to expand\r\nWe were given the gift of critical thought so that we could help to make the world a better place\r\nA place that continues to search for meaning\r\nWe will not lose our humanity to anarchy and treason\r\nThey want to start a war\r\nThey want to enlist you in their fight, yet they have no compassion for it's impact on humanity\n\nWe do not come from a place of destruction, but rather, a place of emotion\n\nA place where we lead with the heart and mind\n\nNot a place of reactionary behaviour\n\nThe mind will prevail\n\nWon't you prevail with us?",
