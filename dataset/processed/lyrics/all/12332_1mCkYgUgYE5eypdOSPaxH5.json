  "lyrics": "Can you explain\r\nThis subtle change\r\nThat dull, sweet ache\r\nThat takes my mind\r\nTo a place where nothing can see\r\nDissatisfied, as you drift back to what you were\n\nBefore, before you came here\n\nI'm losing some pieces, here at the end\n\nAnd I can't find exactly where I came in\n\n\n\nDrifting backwards into nothing\n\n\n\nOh, my god it's watching me and moving in me\n\nI feel its sickness in me\n\nI see sickened entropic vision\n\nDeath above me, and rot below\n\nI feel the change\n\n\n\nCan you explain\n\nThis subtle change\n\nThat dull, sweet ache\n\nThat takes my mind\n\nTo a place that I can't remember\n\n\n\nWhat could it be\n\nThis all-enveloping white\n\nIt wants to decompose me\n\nThey want this living husk\n\n\n\nEyes move in silence\n\nThrough a blanket of night\n\nThe air here is stagnant\n\nThis wood void of light\n\n\n\nNot for the eyes of silence\n\nWithered in this wicked copse\n\nThey only seek to change me\n\nFrom man to fetid rot\n\n\n\nSpeaking to me, the only voice I hear\n\nCaresses me with its cold and static logic\n\nMoving backwards through a forest of transition\n\nI'm drifting backwards into nothing\n\n\n\nCan you explain (I don't think they can hear me)\n\nThis subtle change (Is the forest screaming?)\n\nCan you explain (Stark dissatisfaction)\n\nI can't remember why I came here",
