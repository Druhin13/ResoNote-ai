  "lyrics": "Through the juno bush you see her lips are miming gwen stefani\r\nThe horizon takes a trip along her body\r\nHearing all the posters on your wall\r\nAs they talk about my chances\r\nBoy, you're so tragic\r\nYour floor was damaged from months ago\n\nWhere you dropped a hot comb dancing to neo soul\n\nThe trees are gold on your iphone background\n\nWhich is funny cos you cut down\n\nLike eight last spring for the view now\n\nHow's it look, baby?\n\nHow's it feel?\n\nIs it too much for you?\n\nBig fucking deal\n\n\n\nMe me me\n\nThat's all we know\n\n\n\nYou might think you do\n\nBut i bet you don't\n\n\n\nI heard you joined the peace corps\n\nPlanting ferns & feeding the poor\n\nYou're not so bad anymore\n\n\n\nMe me me\n\nThat's all we know\n\n\n\nYou might think you do\n\nBut i bet you don't",
