  "lyrics": "I remember wasting time\r\nWatching as the planes fly by\r\nI remember hearing the engines echoing through the sky\r\nAnd they used to say\r\nThat someday you'll forget it\n\nYou won't hear them \n\nAnd they used to say \n\nThat time goes by\n\nThat nothing changes \n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI won't miss my flight again\n\nI'm not where I belong\n\nSo give me just one chance\n\nAnd one by one I'll prove you wrong\n\nOne by one I'll prove you wrong\n\n\n\nI remember every night\n\nSitting by the runway side\n\nI remember waiting for a reason to say goodbye\n\n\n\nAnd they used to say\n\nThat someday you'll forget it\n\nYou won't hear them \n\nAnd they used to say\n\nThe day goes by but you can't change it\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n\n\nSometimes I think I've been wrong \n\nBut this is the place that I think I belong\n\nAnd everytime I speak my mind I'm leaving you behind\n\n\n\nand I won't miss my flight again\n\nI'm not where I belong\n\nSo give me just one chance\n\nAnd one by one I'll prove you wrong\n\n\n\nI won't miss my flight again\n\nI'm not where I belong\n\nSo give me just one chance\n\nAnd one by one I'll prove you wrong\n\none by one I'll prove you wrong\n\none by one I'll prove you wrong\n\none by one I'll prove you wrong",
