  "lyrics": "I want a nice suburban girl\r\nWith a neck tattoo and her conscience swirling\r\nI found an ocean I stole a pearl\r\nWith my conscience clean and my compass turning\r\nWho you let go\n\nWhen you let go says it all\n\nI never meant to break your fall\n\nWith the deadliest treason\n\nNo reason at all\n\nWith the deadliest treason\n\nNo reason at all\n\n\n\nI had a nice suburban world\n\nWith a football team and some movie theaters\n\nWe stole that summer I think it was cursed\n\nCause that winter came and I've never seen her\n\n\n\nWho you let go\n\nWhen you let go says it all\n\nI never meant to break your fall\n\nWith the deadliest treason\n\nNo reason at all\n\nWith the deadliest treason\n\nNo reason at all\n\n\n\nI'll meet a nice suburban girl\n\nWe'll get neck tattoos saying what's your hurry?\n\nWe'll trade our secrets pretend that it works\n\nTell one of us leaves this small town first",
