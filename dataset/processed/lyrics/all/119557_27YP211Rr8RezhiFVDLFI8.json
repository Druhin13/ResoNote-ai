  "lyrics": "Remember we were staring up to those peaks on the horizon?\r\nYou told me if I faced my fears, there was no doubt I could climb them\r\nThere's nothing I have wanted more\r\nThe only one I've been waiting for\r\nSo hold your breath and close your eyes\n\nThe night is cold but the sun will rise\n\n\n\nCounting down to the light, through the night\n\nJust waiting for tomorrow\n\nAlmost there, almost time\n\nAll my life, just waiting\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more, waiting for tomorrow\n\n\n\nJust waiting for tomorrow\n\n\n\nFear is creeping up behind as this road is finally ending\n\nI can't find order in my mind but this noise inside so deafening\n\n\n\nThere's nothing I have wanted more\n\nThe only one I've been waiting for\n\nSo hold your breath and close your eyes\n\nThe night is cold but the sun will rise\n\n\n\nCounting down to the light, through the night\n\nJust waiting for tomorrow\n\nAlmost there, almost time\n\nAll my life, just waiting\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more, waiting for tomorrow\n\n\n\nJust waiting\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more day\n\nIt's only one more, waiting for tomorrow\n\nWaiting for tomorrow\n\nWaiting for tomorrow\n\n\n\nWaiting for tomorrow",
