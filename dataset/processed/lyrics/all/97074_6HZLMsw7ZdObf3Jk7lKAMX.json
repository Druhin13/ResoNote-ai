  "lyrics": "Tracing our fingers from right to left\r\nWe're too drunk to even walk\r\nAnd all of a sudden you bring up our problems\r\nSo I guess you wanna talk\r\n'Cause they say the bigger the love, the harder the fall\r\nWell, I'm crashing through the floor\n\n\n\nSaid you're leaving\n\nWhen the morning comes\n\nAll packed up\n\n\n\nIf the feeling's gone\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\nJust keep on holding on\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\n\n\nAll our memories are packed into boxes\n\nStacked up against the door\n\n'Cause they say the bigger the love, the harder the fall\n\nWell, I'm crashing through the floor\n\n\n\nI still feel your breath on my lips\n\nAs you're walking out the door\n\nBut my hand starts to slip\n\nNever felt like this before\n\n\n\nIf the feeling's gone\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\nJust keep on holding on\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\n\n\nI've been looking in the mirror\n\nTrying to figure myself out\n\nI've been wondering where I went wrong\n\nBut now you're not here\n\nIt's like the daylight never comes\n\nSo I'll keep on holding on\n\n\n\nSaid you're leaving\n\nWhen the morning comes\n\nAll packed up\n\n\n\nIf the feeling's gone\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\nJust keep on holding on\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\nIf the feeling's gone\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me\n\nIf the feeling's gone\n\nStay awake, stay awake, stay awake with me",
