  "lyrics": "All the hands I’ve made\r\nGrow in time\r\nFeel my light\r\nYour plastic bones are mine\r\nIf you want to be angry\n\nI don’t mind. I’ll let you go\n\nIf you want to be angry\n\nI don’t mind. I’ll leave you alone\n\n\n\nI am sorry\n\nI know I am wrong\n\n\n\nSo take it all\n\nI want to be out of control\n\nSo take it all\n\nI want to be out of control\n\n\n\nI am smiling wide\n\nI’m the reason the sky is blue\n\nCareful design\n\nWas poured into me and poured into you\n\n\n\nIf you want to be angry\n\nI don’t mind. I’ll let you go\n\nIf you want to be angry\n\nI don’t mind. I’ll leave you alone\n\n\n\nI am sorry\n\nI know I am wrong\n\n\n\nSo take it all\n\nI want to be out of control\n\nSo take it all\n\nI want to be out of control\n\n\n\nOnly you know what to do now\n\nOnly you know what to do\n\nOnly you know what to do now\n\nOnly you know what to do",
