(Ewwww)\n\nWhat you so mad for?\n\nHalloween come around and we ain't knocking on your door mane\n\n\n\nMr. Grinch you're a bad banana\n\nYou're gonna spoil everybody with your bad attitude\n\nMr. Grinch\n\nLa-la-la-la\n\nWho is this mean fellow\n\nWith his skin all green and his teeth all yellow?\n\nHalloween come around and we ain't knocking on your door mane\n\nBad banana",
