  "lyrics": "You were young, just a child\r\nImagination running wild\r\nThere was nothing but the glow\r\nOf fireflies and chasing rainbows\r\nWonder where that child went\r\nVanished with your innocence\n\nHe grew up and he was told\n\nHe better stop daydreaming\n\n\n\nThere's no sunshine in your face\n\nThere's no blue sky in your brain\n\nYou just lay in bed all day\n\nWatching the world twist away\n\n\n\nThat child is still alive\n\nIn that crescent of your mind\n\nDon't be afraid, you don't have to hide\n\nJust put your little hand in mine\n\n'Cause tonight we're gonna fly\n\nLike birds of paradise\n\n\n\nRemember when you were green\n\nAnd you touched eternity\n\nSeems like only yesterday\n\nAll you ever did was play\n\nNow you walk the ruined road\n\nYou don't let your garden grow\n\nYou let it lay there paralyzed\n\nYou give it only poison\n\n\n\nNo more sunshine in your face\n\nNo more blue sky in your brain\n\nYou just lay in bed all day\n\nWatching the world twist away\n\n\n\nThat child is still alive\n\nIn that crescent of your mind\n\nDon't be afraid, you don't have to hide\n\nJust put your little hand in mine\n\n'Cause tonight we're gonna fly\n\nLike birds of paradise\n\n\n\nThere's no sunshine in your face\n\nThere's no blue sky in your brain\n\nYou just lay in bed all day\n\nWatching the world twist away\n\n\n\nThat child is still alive\n\nIn that crescent of your mind\n\nDon't be afraid, you don't have to hide\n\nTonight we're gonna fly\n\nYeah, tonight we're gonna fly\n\nLike birds of paradise\n\nYeah, it's your mind\n\nShow yourself and come outside\n\nPut your little hand in mine\n\nYeah, tonight we're gonna fly\n\nLike birds of paradise",
