  "lyrics": "On our way to the sky\r\nWe're gonna look down on tonight\r\nWhen we die, you and I\r\nTwo heartbreak soldiers\r\nWhen you lay by my side\r\nI see the whole world through your eyes\n\nRide or die, you and I\n\n\n\nLive or die, yah\n\nLive or die\n\nGot you and I\n\nGot you tonight, yah\n\nLive or die, yah\n\nLive or die\n\nGot you and I\n\nGot you tonight\n\n\n\nHave you ever seen a red flower? Yeah\n\nHave you ever seen a gold flower? Aye\n\nCame from a broken home, parents never saw it\n\nNow I'm living all alone, taking care of us all, yeah\n\nFlashes in my face, I guess that's what you get with all this fame\n\nJust because it's that you gang does not mean that you really gang\n\nWeather changes with my mood, it never really stays the same\n\nAnd one plus one is two, and without you I think I'd go insane\n\nAnd what you think? Pause, let it sink in\n\nThey threw me in and now I'm drowning in the deep end\n\nIf I'm religious, you're the one that I believe in\n\nYou've been here with me to help me fight all my demons\n\n\n\nOn our way to the sky\n\nWe're gonna look down on tonight\n\nWhen we die, you and I\n\nTwo heartbreak soldiers\n\nWhen you lay by my side\n\nI see the whole world through your eyes\n\nRide or die, you and I\n\n\n\nTo live or die, what's the price on a life?\n\nIf there ain't no price tag, I might take it right\n\nIf I hit it from the back, I might just hit it twice\n\nRest in peace to everyone that we lost in life\n\nAnd I just wanna run away-ay-ay\n\nI just wanna run away-ay-ay\n\nI just wanna run away-ay-ay, yeah-eah-eah-eah,ay\n\n(With you, baby)\n\n\n\nLive or die, yah\n\nLive or die\n\nGot you and I\n\nGot you tonight, yah\n\nLive or die, yah\n\nLive or die\n\nGot you and I\n\nGot you tonight",
