  "lyrics": "You made me tough, you made me numb\r\nYou are the maker of what I've become\r\nAnd now I am strong where I was weak\r\nAnd I am unafraid of being me\r\nSo say hello to the monster that you made\n\nThank you for the pain, thank you for the hate\n\nThank you for the way that you left me scarred\n\nThank you for the stain that you left on my brain\n\nNow because of you I've got a heart of Novocain\n\nA heart of Novocain\n\n\n\nOnce upon a time you had control\n\nAnd on and over my poor soul\n\nAnd the trust in you but now I see\n\nYou never knew the real me\n\nAnd now I'm angry and you wonder why\n\nYou see a fire burning in my eyes\n\nOnce you had me but you lost me now\n\nAnd there's no going back\n\nSo say hello to the monster that you made\n\n\n\nThank you for the pain, thank you for the hate\n\nThank you for the way that you left me scarred\n\nThank you for the stain that you left on my brain\n\nNow because of you I've got a heart of Novocain\n\nA heart of Novocain\n\n\n\nMy fear has died, my tears have dried\n\nI don't feel afraid and I won't run away\n\nI believe in me and now I see\n\nRight through your lies, hiding being your eyes\n\nBecause of you I'll make it through\n\nAnd nothing can hurt me like you did anymore\n\n\n\nThank you for the pain, thank you for the hate\n\nThank you for the way that you left me scarred\n\nNow there's nothing you can say to wash it all away\n\nNow because of you I've got a heart of Novocain\n\nA heart of Novocain\n\nA heart of Novocain\n\nA heart of Novocain",
