  "lyrics": "See the signs on your face\r\nMemories the shuttle away\r\nCarrying the past, stalking your place\r\nBlaming your look under rain\r\nDreams are hard to follow when you're dreaming behind the window\n\nHoldin' it back, playin' it safe\n\nWondering \"did I do this right?\", ain't it for tomorrow\n\nThere is no life without mistakes\n\n\n\nEverytime, you try your way\n\nTalk to your feels in a harder way\n\nAll it on you so you run again\n\nAll it on you so you run again\n\nAll it on you so you run again\n\n\n\nRemember, we were brave\n\nSomehow, time take that all way\n\nCalling the wave, I know the place\n\nIt's all in your head, in your way\n\n\n\nDreams are hard to follow when you're dreaming behind the window\n\nHoldin' it back, playin' it safe\n\nWondering \"did I do this right?\" and saving it for tomorrow\n\nThere is no life without mistakes\n\n\n\nEverytime, you tie your way\n\nTalk to your feels in a harder way\n\nAll it on you so you run again\n\nAll it on you so you run again\n\nAll it on you so you run again",
