  "lyrics": "No, it’s not a slow dance tonight\r\nNo time for romance ‘coz she’s not got tomorrow on her mind\r\nHe needed you in that hotel room but the moment ran away\r\nLoose lips sink ships with his hands on your hips\r\nSo save the bottle for better days\r\nSo save the bottle for better days\n\n\n\nShe’s eighteen, eighteen\n\nShe’s just another loose drama queen\n\nShe’ll fake her way to the top\n\nHer lipsticks all that she’s got so you can count on her going down\n\n\n\nAnd all the grass stained jeans won’t help her find her peace\n\nThere’s only one way to make it right tonight\n\n\n\nTook a shot and missed on a drunken kiss\n\nAnother moment that got away\n\nIf her sheets could speak, oh, the things that they would teach\n\nSinging tales of poisoned memories\n\nSo save the bottle for better days\n\n\n\nShe’s eighteen, eighteen\n\nShe’s just another loose drama queen\n\nShe’ll fake her way to the top\n\nHer lipsticks all that she’s got so you can count on her going down\n\nShe’s eighteen, eighteen\n\nMakes promises of promiscuity\n\nShe’ll turn his life into mess and she just couldn’t care less\n\nSo you can count on her going down\n\n\n\nAll the drugs and tears\n\nWill never turn back all the years\n\nThere’s only one way to make it right\n\nNow the cards are dealt\n\nWell come and take a good look at yourself\n\nWas this who you wanted to be?\n\nEighteen and naiveshe’s eighteen, eighteen\n\nShe’s just another loose drama queen\n\nShe’ll fake her way to the top\n\nHer lipsticks all that she’s got so you can…\n\n\n\nShe’s eighteen, eighteen\n\nMakes promises of promiscuity\n\nShe’ll turn his life into mess and she just couldn’t care less\n\nSo you can count on her going down\n\nYeah, you can count on her going down\n\nYeah, you can count on her going down",
