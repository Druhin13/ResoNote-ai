  "lyrics": "I've been waiting on a thrill\r\nTo touch your skin and feel you in\r\nBewitched by your body\r\nThis can kill and make you sin\r\nDon't let absence get you down\n\nDon't let absence make you mess around\n\n\n\nThen she started to think and started to cry\n\nAll alone in our bed just to get through the night\n\nBut lonely girl you're still mine\n\nLonely girl we've got the time\n\nIf it's enough to keep your mind\n\nWe got nothing to lose\n\n\n\nYou've been waiting on a call\n\nTo hear my words to let me in\n\nBut only me\n\nJust let me in\n\nJust let me in\n\n\n\nThen she started to think and started to cry\n\nAll alone in our bed just to get through the night\n\nBut lonely girl you're still mine\n\nLonely girl we've got the time\n\nIf it's enough to keep your mind\n\nWe got nothing to lose\n\n\n\nMoments lost but not the faith in them\n\nImpunity can overwhelm\n\nMoments but not the faith in them\n\n\n\nThen she started to think and started to cry\n\nAll alone in our bed just to get through the night\n\nBut lonely girl you're still mine\n\nLonely girl we've got the time\n\nIf it's enough to keep your mind\n\nWe got nothing to lose",
