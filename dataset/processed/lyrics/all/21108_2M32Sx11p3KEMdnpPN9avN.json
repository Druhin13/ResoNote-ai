  "lyrics": "Walk through the shattered realm - face your creator\r\nFace your creator\r\nObserve the formation of time - Omnipotent existence\r\nThe embodiment of a lifeless soul\r\nConceived through chaos and misery\r\nExistence shall be erased\r\nYour existence will be denied\r\nThis will be the end of human population as we know it\r\nAnd there will be no second chances for salvation nor redemption\r\nDead people walk among the living\r\nThey subdue the Earth\r\nBehold the fourth kind\r\nBow down before your new born god\r\nThe architect of time\r\nOmnipotent existence\r\nWatch them perish one by one\r\nThe circulation of life and death\r\nThis will be the end of human population as we know it\r\nAnd there will be no second chances for salvation nor redemption\r\nWhen the balance of existence will collapse\r\nThe harvesting collectors will clutch the earth\r\nFilled with worthless human rot\r\nThey will recreate their own design\r\nThey shall create the fourth kind",
