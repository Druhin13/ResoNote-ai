  "lyrics": "I won't wear makeup on Thursday\r\nI'm sick of covering up\r\nI'm tired of feeling so broken\r\nI'm tired of falling in love\r\nSometimes I'm shy and I'm anxious\r\nSometimes I'm down on my knees\n\nSometimes I try to embrace all my insecurities\n\nSo I won't wear makeup on Thursday\n\n'Cause who I am is enough\n\n\n\nAnd there are many things that I could change so slightly\n\nBut why would I succumb to something so unlike me?\n\nI was always taught to just be myself\n\nDon't change for anyone\n\n\n\nI wanna laugh, I wanna cry\n\nDon't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah\n\nDon't wanna wake up and feel insecure\n\nI wanna sing, I wanna dance\n\nI wanna feel love inside my hands again\n\nI just wanna feel beautiful\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful\n\n\n\nI'll wear my sweatpants on Thursday\n\nAnd I'll drink soft drink from a can\n\nI'll build my own independence\n\nI don't always need a man\n\nYou know sometimes I feel lonely\n\nCould do with the company\n\nOh, I get high when I'm down\n\nBut you know that's alright with me\n\nSo I will do nothing on Thursday\n\nSit alone and be\n\n\n\nAnd there are many things that I could change so slightly\n\nBut why would I succumb to something so unlike me?\n\nI was always taught to just be myself\n\nDon't change for anyone\n\n\n\nI wanna laugh, I wanna cry\n\nDon't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah\n\nDon't wanna wake up and feel insecure\n\nI wanna sing, I wanna dance\n\nI wanna feel love inside my hands again\n\nI just wanna feel beautiful\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful\n\n\n\nI won't wear makeup on Thursday\n\n'Cause who I am is enough\n\n\n\nI wanna laugh, I wanna cry\n\nDon't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah\n\nDon't wanna wake up and feel insecure\n\nI wanna sing, I wanna dance\n\nI wanna feel love inside my hands again\n\nI just wanna feel beautiful\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh, I-\n\nOh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful",
