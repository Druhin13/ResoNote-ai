  "lyrics": "Oh, I'm so over calling my mama\r\nYeah and all my friends are tired of hearing all my drama\r\nSitting at home in my pyjamas\r\nWhen I got a new dress hanging in my closet\r\nI think I'm gonna put it on\n\nI think I'm gonna show it off\n\nAnd give it all I got\n\n\n\nYeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, like I never even loved him\n\nThrow my hands up when the music starts\n\nShake off these scars\n\nLike he ain't got nothing left on me\n\nGonna find a new rhythm till I forget him\n\nGonna move on till the memory fades\n\nYeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, oh woah\n\n\n\nTall, dark and handsome (I see you) across the room\n\nI let him spin me round, I let him make a move\n\nBecause I can now that you're gone and I'm moving on\n\nLike there ain't nothing wrong\n\n\n\nYeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, like I never even loved him\n\nThrow my hands up when the music starts\n\nShake off these scars\n\nLike he ain't got nothing left on me\n\nGonna find a new rhythm till I forget him\n\nGonna move on till the memory fades\n\nYeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, oh woah\n\nMy broken heart, baby\n\nMy broken heart\n\n\n\nHere we go\n\nAnd it's a couple steps to the left\n\nI forget how he left\n\nThen move to the right\n\nAnd it starts to feel alright again\n\nDrop it low 'cause I ain't feeling low no more\n\nLeave it all on the floor\n\n\n\nI think I'm gonna put it on\n\nI think I'm gonna show it off\n\nAnd give it all I got\n\n\n\nYeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, like I never even loved him\n\nThrow my hands up when the music starts\n\nShake off these scars\n\nLike he ain't got nothing left on me\n\n\n\nGonna find a new rhythm till I forget him\n\nGonna move on till the memory fades\n\nYeah, tonight I'm gonna dance away my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, oh woah\n\nMy broken heart, baby\n\nDance away, dance away, dance away now",
