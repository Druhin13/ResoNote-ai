Lamm)\r\nWaiting for the break of day\r\nSearching for something to say\r\nFlashing lights against the sky\r\nGiving up I close my eyes\n\nSitting cross-legged on the floor\n\n25 or 6 to 4\n\nStaring blindly into space\n\nGetting up to splash my face\n\nWanting just to stay awake\n\nWondering how much I can take\n\nShould I try to do some more\n\n25 or 6 to 4\n\nFeeling like I ought to sleep\n\nSpinning room is sinking deep\n\nSearching for something to say\n\nWaiting for the break of day\n\n25 or 6 to 4\n\n25 or 6 to 4",
