  "lyrics": "We don't really talk too often\r\n'Cause I don't wanna tell you I believe\r\nYou're just another ghost I'm stalking\r\nMore stories in wind that whisper things I'd rather see\r\nI want this time to mean something to me\n\nI have to feel my blood start boiling\n\nIf all we do is grow apart then\n\nCan we ever get back to the seed?\n\n\n\nWe don't know love\n\nTill it's taken from us\n\nWe don't know love\n\nWe don't know love\n\n\n\nResurrect the story I was told\n\nOf when we were awake, alone and cold\n\nUp against the only truth we know\n\nWith every question, is just another myth to tell our own\n\n\n\nI want this time to mean something to me\n\nI have to feel my blood start boiling\n\nIf all we do is grow apart then\n\nCan we ever get back to the seed?\n\n\n\nWe don't know love\n\nTill it's taken from us\n\nWe don't know love\n\nWe don't know love\n\nTill it's taken from us\n\nWe don't know love\n\n\n\nWe don't, we don't, we don't\n\nWe don't, we don't know love\n\nWe don't, we don't, we don't\n\n\n\nWe don't know love\n\nTill it's taken from us\n\nWe don't know love\n\nWe don't know love\n\nTill it's taken from us\n\nWe don't know love, ooh ooh\n\nWe don't know love\n\nTill it's taken from us",
