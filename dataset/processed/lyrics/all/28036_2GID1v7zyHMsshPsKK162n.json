  "lyrics": "Take off those headphones and let this world pour into you\r\nThrow off those glasses and then you'll start seeing\r\nForget those battles, those ones that mean nothing to you\r\nKnow you're alive and just smile, you'll start hearing\r\nSomewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere\n\nSomewhere out among the silence there's a voice\n\nThere's a feeling that takes over and it has no fear\n\nWhen you're caught between the signal and the noise\n\n\n\nShout out the names of everyone that feels most dear to you\n\nPraise to the moon and the sun and you'll start feeling\n\nShut out those ghosts with their talk is far too negative\n\nMake love your armor and smile and you'll start hearing\n\n\n\nSomewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere\n\nSomewhere out among the silence there's a voice\n\nThere's a feeling it takes over and it has no fear\n\nWhen you're caught between the signal and the noise\n\nAnd the noise\n\nAnd the noise\n\n\n\nAnd the noise\n\n\n\nSomewhere out beneath the heavens and the atmosphere\n\nSomewhere out among the silence there's a voice\n\nThere's a feeling it takes over and it has no fear\n\nWhen you're caught between the signal and the noise\n\nYou're just caught between the signal and the noise",
