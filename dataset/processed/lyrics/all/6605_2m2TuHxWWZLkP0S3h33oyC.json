  "lyrics": "And we were jubilant, willing to pretend\r\nWe were not losing time, time wasted\r\nLike any other day we will make the bed\r\nThinking it is dead, it is finally dead\r\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe quiet is ours, the work has begun\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\n\n\nI search for patterns, sense that isnâ€™t there\n\nYou can have everything, and still you have nothing\n\nSo I take them all apart, then I put them back\n\nSometimes it takes a long, long, long time\n\n\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe longer the day, the nearer the sun\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe quiet is ours, the work has begun\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe longer the day, the nearer the sun\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs\n\nThe quiet is ours, the work has begun\n\nThe louder I call, the faster it runs",
