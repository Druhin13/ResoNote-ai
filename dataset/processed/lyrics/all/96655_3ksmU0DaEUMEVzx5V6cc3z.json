  "lyrics": "Been flying solo for so long\r\nNobody's singing a harmony\r\nUp there just me and my shadow\r\nNo base, no guitar, no tambourine\r\nAnd I found you like a melody\n\nYou were singing in the same key as me\n\nWe had 'em dancing in the streets\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a one man band\n\nI don't wanna be a rolling stone alone\n\nPutting miles on a run-down van\n\nBaby, we can take our own show on the road\n\nI'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune\n\nWe'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms\n\nBaby, take my hand\n\nI don't wanna be a one man band\n\n\n\nI wanna run down your wild dreams\n\nAnd I wanna chase every high with you\n\nCount every rip in these old jeans\n\nWe'll never learn how to sing the blues\n\n\n\nIf I'm gonna be famous\n\nGirl, I wanna be famous with you\n\nWe got our own little groove\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a one man band\n\nI don't wanna be a rolling stone alone\n\nPutting miles on a run-down van\n\nBaby, we can take our own show on the road\n\nI'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune\n\nWe'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms\n\nBaby, take my hand\n\n'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band\n\n\n\nWhen the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down\n\nThe chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around\n\nAnd nobody's payin', we'll still be playin'\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a one man band\n\nI don't wanna be a rolling stone alone\n\nPutting miles on a run-down van\n\nBaby, we can take our own show on the road\n\nI'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune\n\nWe'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms\n\nBaby, take my hand\n\n'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band\n\n\n\nI don't wanna be a one man band",
