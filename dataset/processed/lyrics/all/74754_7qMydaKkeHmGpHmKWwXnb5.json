  "lyrics": "Blindsided, traumatized, interest lost\r\nIsolated, self-destructive, callous born\r\nSoul extinguished, mind stripped, allegiance lost\r\nConstant panic, agitation, total loss\r\nKnow that the end is far, the pain is forever\r\nFormer life long expired and soon forgotten\n\nNeed for closure, need for justice and revenge\n\nLoss of sleep, toxic grudge, hateful thoughts\n\nAllow me one sacrifice\n\nI’ll repent and have my sins forgiven\n\nAnd when your walls crumble\n\nAnd your ego becomes pierced\n\nYou aren’t prepared to suffer\n\nTo feel the pain that you inflict",
