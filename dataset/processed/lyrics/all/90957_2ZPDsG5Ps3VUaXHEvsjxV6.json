  "lyrics": "Tonight I'm sleeping wide awake\r\nI can't promise we'll be okay\r\nBut I'll keep fighting 'til the end\r\nTo make you feel safe with me\r\nTo make you feel safe with me\n\nI made the darkness sleep again\n\nTo flee creatures from this land\n\nWe're now safe but I can't forget\n\nHow hard I fear the end",
