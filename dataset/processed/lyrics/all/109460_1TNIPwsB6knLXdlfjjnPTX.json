  "lyrics": "I stop and listen sometimes\r\nClock myself into your eyes\r\nAnd I can see what you see and I like it\r\nI'm a fish in a blue sea and I like it\r\nBut don't pick on me with your sympathy\n\nI don't, I don't need you to love me\n\n\n\nListen to the people who say\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\n\n\nThis snow is falling heavy\n\nWish my mother would come and get me\n\nForget all this makeup and fall in the red sea\n\nSet the weight of each day like the leaves of our oak tree\n\n\n\nBut don't pick on me with your sympathy\n\nI don't, I don't need you to love me\n\n\n\nListen to the people who say\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\nEverybody's moving away\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\nWater pushes water away\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\n\n\nIt's all good 'cause I feel it too\n\nHanging around with nothing to do\n\nMake friends with the angel that blessed you\n\nMaybe together we get in the good\n\n\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\nLalalala, lalalala\n\nLalalala, lalala",
