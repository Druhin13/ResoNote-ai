  "lyrics": "In one second you weren't there\r\nBut everything around me looks the same\r\nAnd in that second I was scared\r\nBut who the hell am I supposed to blame?\r\nLately I've been using you to mess it all up\n\n'Cause it's been easier to fall than try to walk\n\nBut the cars don't come around the way they used to\n\n\n\nIn this empty house\n\nI called my home\n\nDid I let you down?\n\nI'll never know\n\nIn this empty house\n\n\n\nFaded walls and broken glass\n\nDusty corridors I used to play\n\nHanging paintings of the past\n\nMade me realise I need a change\n\n\n\nLately I've been using you to mess it all up\n\n'Cause it's been easier to fall than try to walk\n\nBut the cars don't come around the way they used to\n\n\n\nIn this empty house\n\nI called my home\n\nDid I let you down?\n\nI'll never know\n\nIn this empty house\n\nI called my home\n\nDid I let you down?\n\nI'll never know\n\nIn this empty\n\n\n\nAll I need, caving in\n\nWhen you went and died again\n\nLosing time, no more late goodbyes\n\n\n\nIn this empty house\n\nI called my home\n\nDid I let you down?\n\nI'll never know\n\nIn this empty house\n\nI called my home\n\nDid I let you down?\n\nI'll never know\n\nIn this empty house",
