  "lyrics": "Don't let the old man in, I wanna leave this alone\r\nCan't leave it up to him, he's knocking on my door\r\nAnd I knew all of my life, that someday it would end\r\nGet up and go outside, don't let the old man in\r\nMany moons I have lived\n\nMy body's weathered and worn\n\nAsk yourself how would you be\n\nIf you didn't know the day you were born\n\n\n\nTry to love on your wife\n\nAnd stay close to your friends\n\nToast each sundown with wine\n\nDon't let the old man in\n\n\n\nMany moons I have lived\n\nMy body's weathered and worn\n\nAsk yourself how would you be\n\nIf you didn't know the day you were born\n\n\n\nWhen he rides up on his horse\n\nAnd you feel that cold bitter wind\n\nLook out your window and smile\n\nDon't let the old man in\n\n\n\nLook out your window and smile\n\nDon't let the old man in",
