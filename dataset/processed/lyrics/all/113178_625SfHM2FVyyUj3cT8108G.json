  "lyrics": "When the sun had left and the winter came\r\nAnd the skyfall could only bring the rain\r\nI sat in darkness, all brokenhearted\r\nI couldn't find a day I didn't feel alone\r\nI never meant to cry, started losing hope\r\nSomehow baby, you broke through and saved me\n\n\n\nYou're an angel, to me you're never leaving\n\n'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in\n\n\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\n\n\nYou make the brightest days from the darkest nights\n\nYou're the riverbed where I was baptized\n\nCleansed all the demons that were killing my freedom\n\nGot me laying down, gimme to ya\n\nGet you singing babe, hallelujah\n\nWe'll be touching, we'll be touching heaven\n\n\n\nYou're an angel, to me you're never leaving\n\n'Cause you're the first thing I know I can believe in\n\n\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\n\n\nI don't need the stars 'cause you shine through me\n\nLike fire in my veins, you're my ecstasy\n\nYou're my ecstasy\n\n\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\nYou're holy, holy, holy, holy\n\nI'm high on loving you\n\nHigh on loving you\n\n\n\nYou're holy",
