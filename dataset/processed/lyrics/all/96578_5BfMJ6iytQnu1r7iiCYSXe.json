I can never read you \n\nAlways leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah\n\nNo, no love don't come easy \n\nEspecially when you're loving me, yeah \n\nIt's never enough for the both of us so sorry\n\nCouldn't have known it would ever be this hard \n\nOoh, we had it all but we lost and that's our fault \n\nI should be here waiting for you to answer my call, no\n\nBut I'm never giving up on what I been \n\nI been focusing on putting me first \n\nSo could never see you with somebody else \n\nI can't even live with being by myself \n\nThat's the part of me that really needs your help \n\nLately I haven't been doing very well \n\nThat's a difference between heaven and hell\n\nI feel happy when you're here with me \n\nI feel hell every time you leave \n\nBut I need to get you off of my back \n\nI got to get you off of my back \n\nWish that we would never take it this far\n\nHere we are going back and forth \n\nI hoped we would never make it this far\n\nBut now I gotta find my worth \n\n\n\nSay you don't love me no more \n\nJust say you don't want me\n\n(Say you don't want me, yeah)\n\nWe don't gotta be no more \n\nIf you really don't want me\n\n(We don't gotta be no more)\n\n\n\nSaid you can't deal with me no more \n\nJust say you don't want me \n\n(Just say you don't want me)\n\nI never know what you feel no more \n\nJust say you don't want me\n\n\n\nWe don't gotta be \n\nWe don't gotta be, hey\n\nNo more\n\nWe don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more",
