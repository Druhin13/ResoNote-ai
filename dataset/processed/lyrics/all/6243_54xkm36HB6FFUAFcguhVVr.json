  "lyrics": "And I wake up early to watch you as you wake\r\nAnd open your eyes to the sound of the rain\r\nCuz I don't want money\r\nAnd I don't want God\r\nI just want to live under the weight of your love\n\nI'd rather go blind, let my body go numb\n\nThan to lose you or the weight of your love\n\n\n\nFlick hair from your shoulder\n\nAnd sleep marks your face\n\nRetreat to the covers from the sound of the rain\n\n\n\nCuz I don't want money\n\nAnd I don't want God\n\nI just want to live under the weight of your love\n\nI'd rather go blind, let my body go numb\n\nThan to lose you or the weight of your love\n\n\n\n... Than to lose you or the weight of your love",
