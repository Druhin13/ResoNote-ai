  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Soft par Vacations\r\nRight from the start\nYou take it to heart\nSomething so small\nStands so tall above you\n\nDon't run\nThey're not so tough\nStand your ground\nYou're not so soft\n\nYou're looking too hard\nFor something that isn't there\nPull yourself out\nYou're overthinking what this is about\n\nSo don't run\n\nThey're not so tough\nStand your ground\nYou're not so soft",
