  "lyrics": "Feel this pain of another day\r\nAs I hear hollow voice I am running away\r\nLike a death grip vice on my scattered brain\r\nI keep falling from grace, gone with no trace\r\nLong for the days of boredom\n\nLong for the days of hope\n\nTake my blame for my past mistakes\n\nI am living with hate, fucking with fate\n\n\n\nThis is the time (the time) we kill (we kill)\n\nAnd fight to find our savior\n\nThe soul (the soul) we save (we save)\n\nWe're reckless and in danger\n\nOhohohohoh ohohohohoh\n\nWhat's lost is found\n\nThis is my vow\n\n\n\nSpeak the shame of eternal rage\n\nI am thinking the truth, I'm going insane\n\nLike a bomb that ticks when my heart clicks\n\nI'll be left for dead with what I've said\n\n\n\nLong for the time that passes\n\nLong for my innocence\n\nSay my name as you play the game\n\nIf I go another day I'll be just the same\n\n\n\nThis is the time (the time) we kill (we kill)\n\nAnd fight to find our savior\n\nThe soul (the soul) we save (we save)\n\nWe're reckless and in danger\n\nOhohohohoh ohohohohoh\n\nWhat's lost is found\n\nThis is my vow\n\n\n\nThis is the time (the time) we kill (we kill)\n\nAnd fight to find our savior\n\nThe soul (the soul) we save (we save)\n\nWe're reckless and in danger\n\nOhohohohoh ohohohohoh\n\nWhat's lost is found\n\nThis is my vow",
