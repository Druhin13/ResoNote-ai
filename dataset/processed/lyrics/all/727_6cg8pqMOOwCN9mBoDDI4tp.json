Swimming pool\n\nI ain't asking for nothing but everything\n\nNothing but everything\n\n\n\nIf I can't walk with you I'd rather walk alone\n\nIf I can't dance with you I'm dancing on my own\n\nThere's so much trouble I can get myself into\n\nBut I'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\n\n\nBut I'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\n\n\nI wish you were here to witness\n\nAnd here listen to my commitment\n\nI want it all, can't you come with me?\n\nMy only enemy is distance\n\n\n\nI ain't ready for another night, missing you\n\nHello, how's in the drain now? Swimming pool\n\nI ain't asking for nothing but everything\n\nNothing but everything\n\n\n\nIf I can't walk with you I'd rather walk alone\n\nIf I can't dance with you I'm dancing on my own\n\nThere's so much trouble I can get myself into\n\nBut I'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\n\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\nI'd rather be missing you\n\n\n\nI ain't ready for another night, missing you\n\nHello, how's in the drain now?
