  "lyrics": "We talked about nothing at all all night\r\nWe slept till the Earth turned one time and woke in the dark\r\nThese walls stronger than steel and stone\r\nStill we're waking all our neighbors up\r\nStay till the winter's done\r\nTell my friends I'm never coming home, aah\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh\n\nGetting lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh\n\nI'm lost on you, I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you\n\nI'm lost on you, I'm lost on you\n\n\n\nYour veins are rushing with stars untamed\n\nA shock to the heart, lighting\n\nYour body's my drug\n\nSo bright you block the sun\n\nBut we keep waking all our neighbors up\n\nStay till the winter's done\n\nAnd tell my friends I'm never coming home, aah\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh\n\nGetting lost on you like I'm someone new, ooh\n\nI'm lost on you, I'm lost on you, I'm lost on you\n\nI'm lost on you, I'm lost on you",
