  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Around The Sun par R.E.M\r\nI want the sun to shine on me\nI want the truth to set me free\nI wish the followers would lead\nwith a voice so strong it could knock me to my knees\n\nHold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming\nHold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off\nHold onto this boy a little longer\nTake another trip around the sun\n\nIf I jumped into the ocean to believe\nIf I climbed a mountain would I have to reach?\nDo I even dare to speak?--to dream?--believe?\nGive me a voice so strong\nI can question what I have seen\n\n\nHold on world 'cause you don't know what's coming\nHold on world 'cause I'm not jumping off\nHold onto this boy a little longer\nTake another trip around the sun\n\nAround the sun\nAround the sun\nAround the sun\nLet my dreams set me free.\nBelieve. believe.\nNow now now now now now",
