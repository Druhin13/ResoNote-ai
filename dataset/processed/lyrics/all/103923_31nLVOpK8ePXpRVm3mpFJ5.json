  "lyrics": "(Tom Petty)\r\nThis might sound strange, might seem dumb\r\nDepends on the side that you take it in from\r\nDepends on the time, depends on the day\r\nDepends on a lot of things, who can say\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\nI just want to let you know that I will stand by you\n\nThrough whatever might come, wherever you run\n\nWill you stand by me when the time comes\n\n\n\nBaby do you understand, am I making this clear\n\nAre you tuning me out cause I'm coming off weird\n\nWell I don't care that's all right\n\nThat's okay, I don't mind\n\n\n\n(Chorus)\n\n\n\nThis ain't the right time to say what's on my mind\n\nI know, but I look in your eyes\n\nAnd there is no real life at all\n\nBaby hold on\n\n\n\nAnd someday soon you'll come around\n\nYou know where I can be found\n\nWhen you heart feels right, seek me out\n\nWe can talk more then babe, but right now\n\n\n\n(Chorus)",
