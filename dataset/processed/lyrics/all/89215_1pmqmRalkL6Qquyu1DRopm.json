  "lyrics": "Mother is gone\r\nHer journey’s unending\r\nShe’s leaving this shore\r\nFor the sea of all knowing\r\nShe’s gone on to find\r\nWhere the gods hide and wait\n\nSilently callin' her children back to them\n\n\n\nMother is gone\n\nHer journey’s unending\n\nI see her pass by\n\nIn the night sky a-glowing\n\nAnd she’ll see the blue of the ocean’s rising\n\nThe tides of a teardrop suspended in heaven\n\n\n\nMother is gone\n\nHer body’s at rest\n\nHer spirit is on\n\nIts heavenly quest\n\nThe sun and the moon\n\nJust two points of light\n\nA beacon from home\n\nAn anchor in flight\n\n\n\nMother is gone\n\nHer journey’s unending\n\nI see her pass by\n\nIn the night sky a-glowing\n\nAnd she’ll see the blue of the ocean’s rising\n\nThe tides of a teardrop suspended in heaven\n\n\n\n\n\nMother is gone\n\nHer soul climbed the mountain\n\nThat leapt to the stars\n\nJust a-singing and shouting\n\nShe lives in the dust\n\nThat shimmers and shines\n\nFollows the pathway\n\nNo mortal can climb\n\n\n\nMother is gone\n\nHer journey’s unending\n\nI see her pass by\n\nIn the night sky a-glowing\n\nAnd she’ll see the blue of the ocean’s rising\n\nThe tides of a teardrop suspended in heaven",
