  "lyrics": "Strong enough to calm the storms\r\nOf fear and unbelief\r\nFierce enough to break the cords\r\nOf death that clung to me\r\n'Cause I have come to know a love\r\nWhose power has overcome\n\nEvery insecurity\n\nAnd Heaven moves and demons flee now\n\nAs I lift my voice to sing\n\n\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\n\n\nClose enough to hold me near\n\nWhen fear is crippling\n\nSafe enough to be my home\n\nWhen my world is crumbling\n\n'Cause I have come to know a love\n\nStronger than the grave\n\nThat in my darkest hour\n\nYou raised me up from death to life now\n\nIn resurrection power\n\n\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong!\n\n\n\nAnd Your love, it vanquished all my enemies\n\nIt broke the cage that silenced me\n\nAnd set this songbird free\n\nI sing, for all the love You've given me\n\nRejoice because You've chosen me\n\nAnd called this orphan home\n\n\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nOh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong\n\nAnd oh, Your love is strong",
