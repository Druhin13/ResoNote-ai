  "lyrics": "I dreamt I had a dream out in the desert\r\nLying naked underneath a liquid sky\r\nI had no past as time was moving backwards\r\nJust the burning sun reflected in my eye\r\nBurning Sun\n\n\n\n[?]\n\n\n\nI crawled onto an island made of plastic\n\nWhere every life's condemned to be undone\n\nTake me back to where it all once started\n\nTake it all back home to the yellow burning sun\n\n\n\nAnd then I dreamt I fell in love with every heartbeat\n\nI got up on my knees and learned to run\n\nI saw things be born and I saw things be dying\n\nIn the haze of the yellow burning sun\n\n\n\nBurning Sun\n\nThe Burning Sun\n\nThe Burning Sun\n\n\n\nI dreamt I had a dream out in the desert\n\nLying naked underneath a liquid sky\n\nI had no past as time was moving backwards\n\nJust the burning sun reflected in my eye",
