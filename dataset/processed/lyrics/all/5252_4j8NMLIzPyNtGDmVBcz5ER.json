  "lyrics": "Apologies in advance jealousy ensues but I choose to understand\r\nI sip slow think slower. Cause people love to judge, when they barely even know ya\r\nI'ma say that again, I sip slow think slower. Because people love to judge, even when they barely even know you\r\nWhen I was 7 used to rock soldiers\r\nHotboys heard it poppin from the Nolia\n\nI need a project chick from the corner, cousin had a friend she was like 10\n\nEven then I used to buy her blow pops from the corner\n\nValintine cards, milk money by tha quarter\n\nFast forward, now it's dumb girls Henny by the 5th. 20 pump 6 condoms and recorders\n\nFucking outta spite kinda sorta, got engaged now I'm thinkin bout a daughter\n\nSpend a lotta time even tho I can't afford her, please keep it coming with the brown water\n\nPlease (oooh) back when I had plans of being HOV , wanted floor change for the quarter-waters\n\nWhen I was naive to these things, I really wanna follow what my heart shares\n\nMoney ain't a thing, untill it's not there\n\nAnd bitches ain't shit till you need a queen, and niggas all the same till you meet a king\n\nYou know whatchu need when you dead broke\n\nYou know what you want when you see the dreams\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me, best me possibly\n\n\n\nUpset drunk on a late night, 2 shots out from a drake life\n\nNigga I remember those days when I used to bump, Day 'N' Nite\n\nScott said I was on my own, since then I been on my own\n\nNah nigga (x2)\n\nI ain't neva had a mothafuckin handout, a bunch of mistakes in my past now I'm tryna stick to a plan route\n\nBut that's life my nigga, sometimes shit just don't pan out\n\nLately I've been trying bite my tongue, dog I've been in a fight so long, so long, so long, so long, so long. With Myself\n\nMirror, mirror on the wall why is it always an act to attack on myself ?\n\nI could use a little slack, for the wealth\n\nBut I'm too afraid to ask for the help\n\nStill attached to the past, and it's felt like way too strong I don't ever wanna wait too long\n\nBut I know if I hold on, know you've grown, go and get your dough baby\n\nHold on know you wrong, just don't lose your soul baby\n\nHold on don't you know, love won't ever fall baby\n\nKilling my, killing my, killing myself bet I could use some sound maybe\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me, best me possibly\n\n\n\nStep up in this bitch like, look at what the cat dragged in\n\nUsed to call my crushes on my momma's house phone, 13 and younging thought I had it mapped back then\n\nI'mma be rich as fuck, lemme bring tha racks back in\n\nHad to keep me motivated in a city full of traitors, drug dealers, blood killers\n\nKeep it old fashioned, (two choices) I'ma be my own captain\n\nRobert Frost Theory, nigga never had siri\n\nThank God for the vision, that was brought back then\n\nNo new phone, I'm just done with all the acts my friend\n\nYou ain't adding to my life, then you're subtracting\n\nYou ain't gotta hit my jack or put the buzz back in\n\nNigga hold the phone, caught up in the late night\n\nCan't stay for the day ma, had to catch a red eye have a safe flight\n\n20/20 tunnel vision through the hate my, intuition got me feeling like Draymond\n\nCircumstances I been slippin over fakeness\n\nNo patience, but I think I think too much (still)\n\nI think I lack confidence (still)\n\nI think I want prominence, dominance good logic and common sense\n\nBut that starts with me\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me\n\nAll I wanna do is be the best me, best me possibly",
