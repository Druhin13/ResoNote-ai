  "lyrics": "I landed on the silver lake\r\nWashed up and feeling blue\r\nHeard the sound of footsteps\r\nDrifting softly to the moon\r\nLooking for clear water\n\nI had to take control\n\nOut there in wilderness\n\nAnother bullet hole\n\n\n\nPlaying it all for gods\n\nYesterday\n\n\n\nIdaho, Idaho\n\nThere's a beauty on the road\n\nAnd everyday I look out of the bus\n\nSilver linings getting lost\n\n\n\nFloated out into the woods\n\nTo hear the old elk call\n\nTouched a rainbow with my hands\n\nI'm dry, I got 'em all\n\n\n\n\"Ride on,\" said the king of cool\n\nYou've got nothing to lose\n\nTinseltown is down the road\n\nIt's the bullet of the noose\n\n\n\nIf you're playing it all for gods\n\nFar away\n\n\n\nIdaho, Idaho\n\nThere's a beauty on the road\n\nAnd everyday I look out of the bus\n\nSilver linings getting lost",
