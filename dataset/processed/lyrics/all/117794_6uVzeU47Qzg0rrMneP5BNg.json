  "lyrics": "Hotels are made for two night stays\r\nChecking in and out\r\nMeeting strangers in the lobby\r\nWaking up and leaving town\r\nThe next day\r\nBut love ain't\n\n\n\nAnd whiskey's poured for when you're bored\n\nAnd alone on Friday night\n\nWhen you want to lose yourself\n\nAnd need a place to hide\n\nFrom all the pain\n\nBut love ain't\n\n\n\nLove ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone\n\nLove ain't you calling me because he ain't picking up his phone\n\nThe way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate\n\nI may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't\n\nCome over let me show you what he can't\n\n'Cause he can only show you what love ain't\n\n\n\nSad movies are for crying on the couch\n\nThere in the dark\n\nThat sad song it was written\n\nJust to try and get your heart to break\n\nBut love ain't\n\n\n\nLove ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone\n\nLove ain't you calling me because he ain't picking up his phone\n\nThe way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate\n\nI may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't\n\nCome over let me show you what he can't\n\n'Cause he can only show you what love ain't\n\n\n\n(Love ain't) I wonder what he's doing\n\n(Love ain't) feeling like a fool\n\nAnd you can't keeping letting him do it to you\n\n\n\n\"Cause love ain't you on a sidewalk in your new dress all alone\n\nLove ain't you calling me 'cause he ain't picking up his phone\n\nThe way you're talking sounds like he's somebody you should hate\n\nI may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't\n\nI may not know what love is girl, but I know what love ain't\n\nCome over let me show you what he can't\n\n\"Cause he can only show you what love ain't\n\nLove ain't (Love ain't)\n\nLove ain't (Love ain't)",
