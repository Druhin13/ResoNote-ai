  "lyrics": "I’m packing up, I’ve gotta move\r\nI’ma blow a fifty-foot hole through the dark clouds in our room\r\nI’m making a change I'm gon' starting today\r\nI’ma roll these dice with a song tonight, I'm gonna whip these blues away\r\nAnd I’m gonna run so far they’ll never find me again\n\nBut I ain’t leavin’, I ain’t leavin’ 'less I’m leavin’ here with you\n\nI’ve been patient while I waited, but I feel it’s time to move\n\nYou’ve been crying, yeah, I’ve seen you\n\nHoney, I’ve been crying too\n\nIf your prayers don’t get to Heaven, I’m gon' keep them safe for you\n\nIf your prayers don’t get to Heaven, I’m gon' keep them safe ‘til they do\n\n\n\nI just wait in the cold, cold gray\n\nBut I know like I’ve been told, yeah, mama said, “Hold onto hope”\n\nShe whispers sweet, \"There's a light and glory”\n\nBut you gotta burn that sound of the voices out that wanna bring you to your knees\n\nAnd you gotta run so far they'll never find you again\n\n\n\nBut I ain’t leavin’, I ain’t leavin’ 'less I’m leavin’ here with you\n\nI’ve been patient while I waited, but I feel it’s time to move\n\nYou’ve been crying, yeah, I’ve seen you\n\nHoney, I’ve been crying too\n\nIf your prayers don’t get to Heaven, I’m gon' keep them safe for you\n\nIf your prayers don’t get to Heaven, I’m gon' keep them safe ‘til they do\n\n\n\nAnd when I was a child, a dream came to me\n\nWhere every soul hanging low found its piece of dignity\n\n'Til that dream gets to Heaven, you can ride this train for free\n\n'Til that dream gets to Heaven, you can ride this train on me\n\nAnd we're gonna run so far they'll never find us again\n\n\n\nBut I ain’t leavin’, I ain’t leavin’ 'less I’m leavin’ here with you\n\nI’ve been patient while I waited, but I feel it’s time to move\n\nYou’ve been crying, yeah, I’ve seen you\n\nHoney, I’ve been crying too\n\nIf your prayers don’t get to Heaven, I’m gon' keep them safe for you\n\nIf your prayers don’t get to Heaven, I’m gon' keep them safe ‘til they do\n\n'Til they do\n\n'Til they do\n\n'Til they do",
