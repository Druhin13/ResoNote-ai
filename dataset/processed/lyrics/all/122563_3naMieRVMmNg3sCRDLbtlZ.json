  "lyrics": "Lovely lovely\r\nIn your jeans, frenzy\r\nAnother movie that I didn't watch with you\r\nAnother movie and I'm gonna have to move\r\nThat final terror is in your house somewhere\r\nHiding in boxes, behind closed doorways\n\nOut from the forest adjacent to your garage\n\nI've seen its marks at the corner of your eyes\n\n\n\nNothing works\n\nNothing works for everyone\n\nGood stories are bad lives\n\nGood stories are bad lives\n\n\n\nTake your hands off your neck and hold\n\nOn to the ghost of my body\n\nYou know that good lives make bad stories\n\nYou can text me\n\nWhen punching mattresses gets old\n\nDon't think it'll always be this way\n\nNot comforted by anything I say\n\nWe were wrecks before we crashed into each other\n\n\n\nSuch a good idea\n\nIf it turns you on\n\nWe have breakdowns\n\nAnd sometimes we don't have breakdowns\n\n\n\nI want to hear you going psycho\n\nIf you're going psycho I wanna hear\n\nEvery conversation just ends with you screaming\n\nNot even words, just ahh-ahh-ahh\n\n\n\nTake my hands off your neck and hold\n\nOn to the ghost of your body\n\nI know that good lives make bad stories\n\nYou can text me\n\nWhen punching mattresses gets old\n\nWhat if it'll always be this way\n\nNot comforted by anything you say\n\nWe were wrecks before we crashed into each other\n\n\n\nDon't worry, you and me won't be alone no more",
