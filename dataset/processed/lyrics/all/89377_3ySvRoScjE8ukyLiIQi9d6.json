  "lyrics": "Gone! Cast away in time\r\nEvil yours, now evil mine\r\nSo I robbed you blind\r\nThe voices in my head suggest\r\nA less than peaceful sight\n\nThe endless possibilities\n\nControlling 935\n\n\n\n[You can't break me!]\n\nCrush the fears of yesterday\n\n[You can't save me!]\n\nBarriers our trust will fade \n\nI'm still in the dark, been waiting all this time\n\nWhile we damn the dead I'm trying to survive\n\nI'm not ready to die!\n\n\n\nDamned! watch the masses fall\n\nBurn it down, control 'em all\n\n[Help me]\n\nMake the crawl to daddy's little girl\n\nAnd read the writings on the wall\n\n\n\nWhile cast into the nothingness\n\nThe final curtain call\n\n\n\n[You can't break me!]\n\nCrush the fears of yesterday\n\n[You can't save me!]\n\nBarriers our trust will fade\n\nI'm still in the dark, been waiting all this time\n\nWhile we damn the dead I'm trying to survive\n\nI'm not ready to die\n\n\n\nThrough the madness we find\n\nLoyalty is no match for power\n\nSay goodbye to your life\n\nLeft to rot in your darkest hour\n\nFriends won't help you now\n\nAs long as you're mine!\n\n\n\n[You can't break me]\n\nCrush the fears of yesterday\n\n[You can't save me]\n\nBarriers our trust will fade \n\nI'm still in the dark, been waiting all this time\n\nWhile we damn the dead I'm trying to survive\n\nI'll control the world one person at a time\n\nAs I damn the dead I'm trying to survive\n\nI'm not ready to die!",
