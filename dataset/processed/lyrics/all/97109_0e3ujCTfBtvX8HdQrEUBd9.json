  "lyrics": "They paved paradise and put up a parking lot\r\nWith a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot\r\nDon’t it always seem to go\r\nThat you don't know what you've got ’til it's gone?\r\nThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot\n\n\n\nThey took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum\n\nAnd they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em\n\n\n\nDon't it always seem to go\n\nThat you don't know what you've got 'til it’s gone?\n\nThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot\n\n\n\nHey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now\n\nGive me spots on my apples\n\nBut leave me the birds and the bees, please\n\n\n\nDon’t it always seem to go\n\nThat you don't know what you’ve got 'til it's gone?\n\nThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\n\n\nLate last night, I heard the screen door slam\n\nAnd a big yellow taxi took away my old man\n\n\n\nDon't it always seem to go\n\nThat you don’t know what you've got 'til it's gone?\n\nThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot, yeah\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nDon't it always seem to go\n\nThat you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?\n\nThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot (come on)\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nOh, They paved paradise, put up a parking lot (one more time)\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nOh-la-la-la\n\nThey paved paradise, put up a parking lot\n\nI didn't wanna end",
