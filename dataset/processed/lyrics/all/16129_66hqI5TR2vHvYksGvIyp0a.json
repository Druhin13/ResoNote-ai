  "lyrics": "When I was a child I was a champion;\r\nDaydreamer;\r\nStuck on an endless trail; down an endless well\r\nI loose myself\r\nWords on a page weren't around enough\n\nI'd drown them out\n\nWouldn't leave a mark if I disappeared\n\nWould it last a year?\n\n\n\nOnce in a while, I feel a part of something\n\nOne thing...is everything\n\n\n\nI feel a good vibration\n\nDidn't know I was aching to...\n\nFeel a good vibration\n\nAnd the sky is painted blue...painted blue\n\nWoo-ooo-oo-ooo, woo-ooo-oo-ooo\n\n\n\nSeven teenagers on a camping trip\n\nNot like this, not quite so dark\n\nAnd the stars reflected on the lake\n\nI was wide awake\n\n\n\nSwam in the middle of a constellation\n\nThought about sinking\n\nWould the ripples on the river\n\nMake it to the shore?\n\n\n\nOnce in a while, I feel a part of something\n\nOne thing...is everything\n\n\n\nI feel a good vibration\n\nDidn't know I was aching to...\n\nFeel a good vibration\n\nAnd the sky is painted blue...painted blue\n\nWoo-ooo-oo-ooo, woo-ooo-oo-ooo\n\n\n\nShe drops her bag by the door\n\nAnd throws her arms around me\n\nAnd I know I'd be okay\n\nShe said, \"It sure feels good\n\nTo be needed by this safety\n\nBut I love imaginal places\"\n\n\n\nI feel a good vibration\n\nShe didn't know I was aching to...\n\nFeel a good vibration\n\nAnd the sky is painted blue Aaah\n\nPainted blue Aaah\n\nPainted blue Aaah\n\nPainted blue Aaah\n\nWoo-ooo-oo-ooo, woo-ooo-oo-ooo\n\nWoo-ooo-oo-ooo, woo-ooo-oo-ooo",
