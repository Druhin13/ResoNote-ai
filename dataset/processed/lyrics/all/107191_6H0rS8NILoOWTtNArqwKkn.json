  "lyrics": "Out in the shiny night, the rain \nwas softly falling \nThe tracks that ran down the boulevard had \nall been washed away \nOut of the silver light, the past came softly calling \n\nAnd I remember the times we spent \n\ninside the Sad Cafe \n\n\n\nOh, it seemed like a holy place, \n\nprotected by amazing grace \n\nAnd we would sing right out loud, the \n\nthings we could not say \n\nWe thought we could change this world \n\nwith words like \"love\" and \"freedom\" \n\nWe were part of the lonely crowd \n\nInside the Sad Cafe \n\n\n\nOh, expecting to fly, \n\nwe would meet on that shore in the \n\nsweet by and by \n\n\n\nSome of their dreams came true, \n\nsome just passed away \n\nAnd some of the stayed behind \n\ninside the Sad Cafe. \n\n\n\nThe clouds rolled in and hid that shore \n\nNow that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more \n\nNow I look at the years gone by, \n\nand wonder at the powers that be. \n\nI don't know why fortune smiles on some \n\nand let's the rest go free \n\n\n\nMaybe the time has drawn the faces I recall \n\nBut things in this life change very slowly, \n\nif they ever change at all \n\nThere's no use in asking why, \n\nit just turned out that way \n\nSo meet me at midnight baby \n\ninside the Sad Cafe. \n\nWhy don't you meet me at midnight baby, \n\ninside the Sad Cafe.",
