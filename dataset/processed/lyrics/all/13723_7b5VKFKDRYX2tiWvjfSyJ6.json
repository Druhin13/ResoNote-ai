  "lyrics": "We stare through new horizons\r\nWatch the waves keep crashing in\r\nLight the fire that you breathe in\r\nUnder the stars we're sailing\r\nHigh seas keep rolling on\n\nThrough the mist so far from home\n\n\n\nBut I'm not alone\n\nSo let the sunshine in\n\nDon't get lost, Don't give in\n\nSo let the sunshine in\n\n\n\nSo let's go walking in the sand (let's go walking in the sand)\n\nDon't let time slip through your hands\n\nYes I've been in love before\n\nBut this times gold and that's for sure\n\nIt's gold, it's gold\n\n\n\nSo I watch you for hours\n\nJust let the nights sink in\n\nWith shadows dancing 'round my skin\n\nSome people call their nightmares\n\nI take my minds astray\n\nWhenever darkness clouds my days\n\n\n\nBut I'm not alone\n\nSo let the sunshine in\n\nDon't get lost, Don't give in\n\nSo let the sunshine in\n\n\n\nSo let's go walking in the sand (let's go walking in the sand)\n\nDon't let time slip through your hands\n\nYes I've been in love before\n\nBut this times gold and that's for sure\n\nIt's gold, it's gold\n\n\n\nSo harmonize your feelings\n\nKeep holding on my hearts reeling\n\nFalling like dominoes\n\nFacing up to the sky\n\nLooking out for a sign\n\nOnly clouds will part\n\nAnd I forgive by the heart\n\nThis is gold you know\n\nCause we've seen gold before\n\nI found the treasure now I've got to keep holding on\n\nAnd maybe this is the time\n\nFor us to give it a try\n\nAnd if we never lose hope maybe our love survives\n\n\n\nSo let's go walking in the sand (let's go walking in the sand)\n\nDon't let time slip through your hands (don't let time slip through your hands)\n\nSo let's go walking in the sand (let's go walking in the sand)\n\nDon't let time slip through your hands\n\nYes I've been in love before\n\nBut this times gold and that's for sure\n\nIt's gold, it's gold",
