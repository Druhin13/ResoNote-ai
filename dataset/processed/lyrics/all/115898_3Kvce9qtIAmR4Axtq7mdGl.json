  "lyrics": "You're running, running away from me\r\nThere's so much, so much that we could be\r\nBut you seem terrified of what you feel inside\r\nYou're running, running away from me\r\nLike love is a bad word\n\n\n\nYou're holding, holding your tongue with me\n\nYou're causing a state of emergency\n\nI need your voice right now\n\nTo wash away my doubt\n\nYou're holding, holding your tongue\n\n\n\nLike love is a bad word\n\n\n\nI can't help but wonder what's been on your mind, yeah\n\nLike you're sabotaging every time it's right\n\nI don't understand why you lie\n\nYou've been getting wasted 'cause you don't wanna face this\n\n\n\nYou're holding, holding your tongue with me\n\nYou're causing a state of emergency\n\nLove is a bad word",
