  "lyrics": "I never dreamed of wantin' more\r\nThan a small town, simple life\r\nA little money in our pockets\r\nYou’re my husband, I'm your wife\r\nBut then I fell in icy water\n\nStanding in the grocery line\n\nI overheard my name and yours\n\nAnd one I did not recognize\n\n\n\nNow everything I thought I knew is walking out the door\n\nThere's a bottle on the table tellin’ me the only thing I know for sure\n\n\n\nIs there's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence\n\nThere's not a blade sharper than a lie\n\nThere's not a low lower than being the last one to know\n\nYou got a brand new start with someone new\n\nAnd there's no whiskey stronger than the truth\n\n\n\nYou never think it'd be your story\n\nWhen you're pulling the wool off your eyes\n\nYou know, you think you know somebody\n\nThen you don't and you don’t know why\n\n\n\nHavin’ me another won't make the clock rewind\n\nBut I’m drinking every drop knowing what I'm looking for I'll never find\n\n\n\nThere's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence\n\nThere’s not a blade sharper than a lie\n\nThere's not a low lower than being the last one to know\n\nOh, you got a brand new start with someone new\n\nAnd there's no whiskey stronger than the truth\n\n\n\nThe only thing I can do\n\nIs pour a glass and pretend\n\nThat this pain's gonna end\n\n\n\nThere's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence\n\nThere's not a blade sharper than a lie\n\nThere's not a low lower than being the last one to know\n\nOh, you got a brand new start with someone new\n\nAnd there's no whiskey stronger than the truth\n\nNo, there's no whiskey stronger than the truth",
