I got it.\"\r\nWhat you gotta say is you don't know anymore\r\nEverybody's got 'em, it's a big bad world\r\nBut I, I want more\r\nI wanna know what it's all for\n\n\n\n'Cause the best days of my life are coming for me\n\nWaiting to be realised\n\nI keep my eye on that prize\n\nIf the best days that I know are just in the past\n\nAm I gonna last forever?\n\nI want more best days\n\n\n\nI could've stayed in college but I didn't wanna\n\nI dropped out and moved to California\n\nLeft Ojai for the next best thing\n\nGot a pick-up truck\n\nI want a diamond ring\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\n'Cause the best days of our life are coming for us\n\nWaiting to be realised\n\nAnd it's not a surprise\n\nIf the best days that we'll know are just in the past\n\nAre we gonna last forever?\n\nI want more best days\n\n\n\nI want more best days\n\nI want more best days\n\nI want more best days\n\nI want more best days\n\nI want more best days\n\nI want more best days\n\nI want more best days\n\n\n\n'Cause the best days of my life are coming for me\n\nWaiting to be realised\n\nI keep my eye on that prize\n\nIf the best days that I know are just in the past\n\nAm I gonna last forever?\n\nI want more best days\n\n\n\nI'm gonna last forever\n\nI, I, oh I, I, I\n\nOh, oh, oh, yeah\n\n'Cause the best days of my life are coming for me",
