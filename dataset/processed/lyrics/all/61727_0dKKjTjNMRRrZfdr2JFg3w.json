  "lyrics": "What can I say? What can I do?\r\nIf it's alright I'd like to fall in front of you\r\nIf that's a fate, tell me it's you\r\nIt's black and white, I don't know why I'm so confused\r\nLeft to my imagination\n\nIt's a long way down\n\n\n\nYou give me your touch, I'm falling like a domino\n\nI find it impossible to take it slow\n\nBlow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful\n\nDo you know I, oh, I want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\n\n\nI'm counting the roses all in a row\n\nAll your apologies wrapped up in fancy bows\n\nAnd tell me again what I already know\n\nI can't stand it when we're dancing on tiptoes\n\n\n\nLeft to my imagination\n\nIt's a long way down\n\n\n\nYou give me your touch, I'm falling like a domino\n\nI find it impossible to take it slow\n\nBlow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful\n\nDo you know I, oh, I want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\n\n\nYou give me your touch, I'm falling like a domino\n\nI find it impossible to take it slow\n\nBlow me a kiss, give me a look so powerful\n\nDo you know I, oh, I want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino\n\nI want to be your domino",
