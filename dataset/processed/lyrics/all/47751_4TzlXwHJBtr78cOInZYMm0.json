  "lyrics": "I never knew the charm of spring\r\nI never met it face to face\r\nI never new my heart could sing\r\nI never missed a warm embrace\r\nTill April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom\r\nHoliday tables under the trees\n\nApril in Paris, this is a feeling\n\nThat no one can ever reprise\n\nI never knew the charm of spring\n\nI never met it face to face\n\nI never new my heart could sing\n\nI never missed a warm embrace\n\nTill April in Paris\n\nWhom can I run to\n\nWhat have you done to my heart",
