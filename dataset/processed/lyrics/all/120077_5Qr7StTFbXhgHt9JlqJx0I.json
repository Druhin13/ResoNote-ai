  "lyrics": "Every time we drew our lines\r\nThey grew legs and walked themselves down the road\r\nBoundaries is my middle name\r\nI can't respect where it's asked or it's shown\r\nSomething 'bout our exchange\n\nIt's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, oh mind\n\nNever want to complain, love you with your wings babe\n\nThese are your skies\n\n\n\nBut then there was the blood from your heart on my hands again\n\nThough I swore I washed it off in the waves\n\nAnd I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry\n\nThat I don't know how to stay away, stay away\n\n\n\nOh, if only you knew just how you taste\n\nOh, if you only you'd seen you walk away\n\nOh I'd follow you into yesterday\n\nThen miles away\n\nAnd I pray for the love that we had underneath\n\nWhen we both promised not to waste love arguing\n\nI love you more than I ever could say\n\n\n\nAnd something about our exchange\n\nIt's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, oh mind\n\nAnd I never want to complain\n\nLove you with your wings babe\n\nThese are your skies, your skies\n\n\n\nAnd there was the blood from your heart on my hands again\n\nThough I swore I washed it out in the rain\n\nAnd I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry\n\nThat I don't know how to stay away\n\n\n\nAnd don't say you don't want no problems\n\nCan't hear through what I say\n\nSay you want it your way\n\nAlways has been your way when it comes to me\n\nGun play, use my heart against me always\n\nWe can't seem to hold space\n\nNo way\n\n\n\nThe blood from your heart on my hands again\n\nThough I swore I washed it off in the waves\n\nI wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry\n\nThat I don't know how to stay away, stay away",
