  "lyrics": "It's the kinda thing that makes you forget everything at a party\r\nGot me taking shots I don't take, but she likes Bacardi\r\nShe gonna steal your attention, make you want more than a friendship\r\nWhen you try to play it cool, but you know she can hear your heartbeat\n\nYou're standing out from everybody\n\nGot my mind drunk, going crazy\n\nGot me looking ahead at things, seeing some better days, calling it \"our place\"\n\nDon't care if you break it, it's a chance worth taking\n\n\n\nI'm gonna throw it out there, you can catch it in the air or you can drop it\n\nBut something's telling me to tell you that I could be falling\n\nNo I didn't expect this, I planned to show up and be reckless\n\nBut now I'm being careful, making sure every word I say is perfect\n\n\n\nYou're standing out from everybody\n\nGot my mind drunk, going crazy\n\nGot me looking ahead at things, seeing some better days, calling it \"our place\"\n\nDon't care if you break it, it's a chance worth taking\n\n\n\nIt's a chance worth taking\n\nIt's a chance, it's a chance\n\nIt's a chance worth taking\n\nIt's a chance worth taking\n\nIt's a chance worth taking\n\nIt's a chance worth taking\n\n\n\nYou're standing out from everybody\n\nGot my mind drunk, going crazy\n\nGot me looking ahead at things, seeing some better days, calling it \"our place\"\n\nDon't care if you break it, it's a chance worth taking\n\n\n\nOh, I'm gonna give it a chance\n\nOh, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't break it\n\nOh, you're worth the chance",
