  "lyrics": "I was on the beach but I was thinking about the bay\r\nGot to the bay but by then I was far away\r\nI was on the ground but looking straight into the sun\r\nBut the sun went down and I couldn't find another one\r\nFor awhile\r\nFor because it was an all-burning feeling in my chest\n\nTo fill the void\n\nOf a long night unwatched by, well, the sun\n\nUntil the morn\n\nUntil when, well, the sun's reborn\n\nAnd so am I\n\nFrom all the scorn buried deep\n\nWithin the psyche of my soul\n\nI was standing down but I was also on the run\n\nIn my mind\n\n\n\nI was on the radio talking with a friend of mine\n\nThere was no format because well, we like it like that\n\nHe was out of his mind and I was way out of mine\n\nThen everything went backwards\n\nWith words coming out\n\nBassackwards\n\nAnd I appreciate him to the utmost degree\n\n\n\nI was on the beach but I was thinking about the bay\n\nGot to the bay but by then I was far away\n\nI was on the ground but looking straight into the sun\n\nBut the sun went down and I couldn't find another one\n\nFor a while\n\nTo fill the void\n\nUntil the morn\n\nThen everything went backwards\n\nI mean, phrases flying out\n\nBassackwards\n\n\n\nI was on the moon but more so, I was in the grass\n\nSo I was chilling out but with a very drifting mind\n\nSo I was on the ground circa planet earth\n\nBut outta sorts but I snapped back, baby\n\nJust in time to jot it down and come around\n\nIt's always to see you\n\nAnd I came around\n\nIt's always to see you here when I come around\n\nOr when I'm plain come, comin' down\n\n\n\nThen everything goes backwards\n\nI mean, everything moving out\n\nThen everything goes backwards\n\nI mean, everything oozing out\n\nBassackwards\n\n(strummin a chet atkins)\n\n\n\nI was standing up\n\nBut you know I hate to still stoop you down\n\nTo my level\n\n\n\nBassackwards\n\nAnd I appreciate her to the utmost degree\n\n\n\nThen everything went backwards\n\nI mean, words coming out\n\nBassackwards\n\n\n\nJust the way things is these days\n\nJust the way they come out these days\n\nJust the way things come out\n\n\n\nTo the utmost degree",
