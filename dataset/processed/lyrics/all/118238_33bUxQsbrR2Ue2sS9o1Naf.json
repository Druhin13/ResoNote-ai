  "lyrics": "The fame, the money, the cars, the sexual glory that goes with all of that apparently\r\nIt was represented in this\r\nYou know the culture wave we created\r\nIs more than a lifestyle\r\nI spend this money but it's nothin' to me (Chonies)\n\nI fuck hoes but it's nothin' to me (Hoes)\n\nDesigner clothes, it ain't nothin' to me (Designer clothes)\n\nAnd I told all my day one niggas that they coming with me\n\nTryna make a way for gang so we all can eat (We all can eat)\n\nDrinking red ever since they took that purple from me (That Act from me)\n\nStuck in bed, I can't move 'cause this syrup on me (This syrup on me)\n\nShe hit the cup, I ask her, then she 'bout to hurl on me? (Hurl on me)\n\n\n\nEvery time my life get a pop, make me wanna drop somethin'\n\nLike lookin' at my money stacked, that's why the whip, I ain't bought one\n\nNot that I can't get one, or not that I don't want one\n\nSo booked, if I even got it, I wouldn't have time to drive one\n\nThinking about that LaFerrari, bout to go and find one\n\nHad a dream about a Sky-Dweller, then I woke up and went and bought one\n\nThe feelin' ain't the same, can't explain if you ain't got one\n\nWhen it's wrapped around your wrist, I can't explain it\n\nSome people let the money change 'em (Change)\n\nAnd I'd still rather be rich than be famous\n\nI seen it with my own eyes (Eyes)\n\nMy brother changed up on me for dead guys\n\nCan't look 'em in the face cause he got red eyes (Red)\n\nFar from I know, he a demon\n\nWhen I found out he was scheming\n\nLookin' at that footage gave me the red eyes (Could've cried)\n\nI couldn't believe it, it's all good\n\nIt show who down for me (Down)\n\n\n\nI spend this money but it's nothin' to me (Chonies)\n\nI fuck hoes but it's nothin' to me (Hoes)\n\nDesigner clothes, it ain't nothin' to me (Designer clothes)\n\nAnd I told all my day one niggas that they coming with me\n\nTryna make a way for gang so we all can eat (We all can eat)\n\nDrinking red ever since they took that purple from me (That Act from me)\n\nStuck in bed, I can't move 'cause this syrup on me (This syrup on me)\n\nShe hit the cup, I ask her did she bite the Earl on me? (Earl on me)\n\n\n\nChonies\n\nHoes\n\nDesigner clothes\n\nGang Gang\n\nWe all can eat\n\nThat Act from me\n\nThat syrup on me\n\nThat syrup on me\n\nI spend this money but it's nothin' to me",
