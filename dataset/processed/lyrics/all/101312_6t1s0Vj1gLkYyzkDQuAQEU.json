  "lyrics": "From crooked faith, the darkness flows\r\nFrom hallowed halls, through broken homes\r\nTo prey upon the weakest lamb\r\nThe cruelest heart is truly\r\nMan\n\nAnd when the judgment came, they told us “turn away”\n\nAs their laughter whipped the halls like cracking bones\n\nSmall words and hollow gestures, the rats are closing ranks\n\nThey paint themselves as angels, oh so wrong\n\n\n\nLibera nos\n\nLibera nos\n\nDeliver us from the blackest of mass\n\nLibera nos\n\nLibera nos\n\nDeliver us justice for the lost\n\n\n\nStraight down\n\nI see their wings are burning\n\nBut it’s a shallow fall\n\nStraight down\n\nI see their wings are burning\n\nThere are no halos to be found\n\n\n\nSo save your breath\n\n\n\nNothing here is sacred, nothing is divine\n\nIf heaven’s gates are open, then I think I’ll wait in line\n\nNothing here is holy when every faith is blind\n\nSo save your breath, I don’t need more excuses\n\n\n\nLibera nos\n\nLibera nos\n\nDeliver us from the blackest of mass\n\nLibera nos\n\nLibera nos\n\nDeliver us justice for the lost\n\n\n\nBut it’s a shallow fall\n\nIt’s a shallow fall\n\n\n\nStraight down\n\nI see their wings are burning\n\nBut it’s a shallow fall\n\nStraight down\n\nI see their wings are burning\n\nThere are no halos to be found\n\n\n\nI’ll never see through the eyes of your lord\n\nBut I have seen through the eyes of a child\n\n\n\nI hope you rot\n\n\n\nStraight down\n\nI see their wings are burning\n\nBut it’s a shallow fall\n\nStraight down\n\nI see their wings are burning\n\nThere are no halos to be found\n\n\n\nFrom crooked faith, the darkness flows\n\nFrom hallowed halls, through broken homes\n\nTo prey upon the weakest lamb\n\nThe cruelest heart is truly\n\nMan",
