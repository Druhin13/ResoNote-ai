  "lyrics": "Oh gravity, Damn gravity\r\nWell it's a permanent summer\r\nBut your words are like water\r\nOh I've started to like you\r\nBut maybe you just don't understand\r\nBeen gone for a few days\n\nOh I like being out of your way\n\n\n\nIt's not like you have much to say\n\nI've got something to tell you\n\nIt's not like you have much to prove\n\n\n\nThere's a world not far from here\n\nI'm thinking maybe I'll go and chill up there\n\nOr maybe, I'll spend the summer up there\n\nYou won't be able to find me, anywhere\n\n\n\nOh, I think you should go\n\nNo, I think you stay\n\nOh, I've got a place where we could lay low\n\nTo the pass the time, only to pass the time\n\nIf that's alright, I know you've got to ride\n\nOh gravity, damn gravity\n\nYou've become out of my reach\n\nBut that's fine with me\n\n\n\nThere's a world not far from here\n\nI'm thinking maybe I'll go and chill up there\n\nOr maybe, I'll spend the summer up there\n\nYou won't be able to find me, anywhere\n\n\n\nI'm worlds away\n\nMy heart's alive but a war has started\n\nOh, you're not for me\n\nMy heart's so bruised, but I'm glad we parted\n\n\n\nThere's a world not far from here\n\nI'm thinking maybe I'll go and chill up there\n\nOr maybe, I'll spend the summer up there\n\nYou won't be able to find me, anywhere",
