  "lyrics": "[DAY TWO]\r\nThis frame it does nothing to to soothe\r\nThoughts of worst case seep through its fiber\r\nThis frame ignites every step\r\nEngulf the shadows it creates\n\n\n\nSmash, ignite\n\nDestroy the creeping eyes\n\nHang the rope\n\nDestroy this weakened frame\n\n\n\nTwo eyes lock onto my pulse\n\nLove comes crashing on my conscience\n\n\n\nChange my focus, lift my spirit, boy\n\nChange my focus, you are my spirit, boy\n\n\n\nThe crimson moon shines down\n\n\n\nShines down\n\nShines down\n\n\n\n(Shines down)\n\nHold your tongue, let me speak\n\n(Shines down)\n\nThere's more to this than it may seem\n\n(Shines down)\n\nHold your tongue, let me speak\n\n(Shines down)\n\nThere's more to this than it may seem\n\n(Shines down)\n\nHold your tongue, let me speak\n\n(Shines down)\n\nThere's more to this than it may seem",
