  "lyrics": "Did I stop and watch the sunset fade?\r\nWhat gave me life and took my breath away?\r\nDid I take a last-call stranger home\r\nSo I wouldn't have to wake up alone?\r\nI heard I was a wild one\n\nI feel like a child, son\n\nBut I really don't recall\n\nHeard I was a fast one\n\nAlways was last one\n\nWaitin' for the other shoe to fall\n\nI've seen pictures\n\nAnd I've heard stories\n\n'Bout the boy I used to be\n\nBut I don't remember me\n\n\n\nWas I just another ghost in this town?\n\nWho was I when no one was around?\n\nDid I even know what I was livin' with?\n\nWho are my favorite songs about?\n\n\n\nI heard I was a wild one\n\nI feel like a child, son\n\nBut I really don't recall\n\nHeard I was a fast one\n\nAlways was last one\n\nWaitin' for the other shoe to fall\n\nI've seen pictures\n\nAnd I've heard stories\n\n'Bout the boy I used to be\n\nBut I don't remember me\n\n\n\nWas my heart beatin' in my chest?\n\nWas I even alive [?]\n\n\n\nI heard I was a wild one\n\nI feel like a child, son\n\nBut I really don't recall\n\nHeard I was a fast one\n\nAlways was last one\n\nWaitin' for the other shoe to fall\n\nI've seen pictures\n\nAnd I've heard stories\n\n'Bout the boy I used to be\n\nBut I don't remember me\n\nNo, I don't remember me before you",
