  "lyrics": "I'm alone, but I feel alright\r\nIn the summertime and the fall\r\nIn the spring when the house is dark\r\nDoesn't bother me at all\r\nI know, I know it's in the light\n\nThe shadows start to move\n\nThere's a hurt, in the wintertime\n\nMakes it hard for you\n\n\n\nThere's a dream, a dream I had\n\nThat makes me sad on the road\n\nThat the sun keeps running from\n\nEveryone I love\n\n\n\nI know, I know, I know I'm leaning\n\nI'm leaning on you\n\nIt's hard, I know, I know there isn't\n\nMuch that you can do\n\n\n\nI know, I know, I know I'll make it\n\nI'll make it through\n\nIn the wintertime there's a candlelight\n\nI only get from you\n\n\n\nI know, I know, it's only light\n\nIt's only light to you\n\nBut there's a thing called the wintertime\n\nI can't make it through\n\n\n\nI know, I know, I know I'm leaning\n\nI'm leaning on you\n\nIt's hard, I know, I know there isn't\n\nMuch that you can do\n\n\n\nI know, I know, I know I'll make it\n\nI'll make it through\n\nIn the wintertime there's a candlelight\n\nI only get from you",
