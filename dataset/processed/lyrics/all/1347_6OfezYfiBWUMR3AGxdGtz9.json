  "lyrics": "You're a funny one, I can tell\r\nIt's been a minute\r\nThought I knew you pretty well, but\r\nI don't know what you're after\r\nI don't know how to get there faster\n\nYou've been fidgeting, I can see\n\nTrying hard to keep your eyes off me\n\nI can tell that you want this\n\nWanna put my finger upon your lips\n\nI don't\n\n\n\nI don't want\n\nYour cool conversation\n\nWant to\n\nExplore levitation\n\nOne, two, three –\n\nNo hesitation\n\n\n\nLike a madrigal, it's getting old\n\nWhen I met you, you were feeling pretty bold\n\nYou're a smooth operator\n\nI don't know if I'll see you later\n\n\n\nYou're illegible and discrete\n\nAnd I love the way you're eyeing me\n\nI can feel that you're restless\n\nWanna run my fingers across your chest\n\nI don't\n\n\n\nI don't want\n\nYour cool conversation\n\nWant to\n\nExplore levitation\n\nOne, two, three –\n\nNo hesitation\n\n\n\nI'm not the first to strike, baby\n\nI know, I know you'll never make a move\n\nI think it's time to bite, maybe\n\nI don't, I don't, I don't wanna get stuck in two-step with you\n\nEvery night, baby\n\nI don't\n\n\n\nI don't want\n\nYour cool conversation\n\nWant to\n\nExplore levitation\n\nOne, two, three –\n\nNo hesitation",
