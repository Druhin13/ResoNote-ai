  "lyrics": "Well, my time went too quickly \nI went lickety-splitly out to my old fifty-five \nAs I pulled away slowly, feelin' so holy, \nGod knows I was feelin' alive \nAnd now the sun's comin' up \nI'm ridin' with Lady Luck \n\nFreeway cars and trucks \n\n\n\nStars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade \n\nJust a wishin' I'd stayed a little longer \n\nLord, don't you know the feelin's gettin' stronger \n\n\n\n\n\nSix in the morning, gave me no warnin' \n\nI had to be on my way \n\nNow the cars are all passin' me, \n\nTrucks are all flashin' me \n\nI'm headed home from your place \n\n\n\nAnd now the sun's comin' up \n\nI'm ridin' with Lady Luck \n\nFreeway cars and trucks \n\n\n\nStars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade \n\nJust a wishin' I'd stayed a little longer \n\nLord, don't you know, the feelin's gettin' stronger \n\n\n\nWell, my time went too quickly \n\nI went lickety-splitly out to my old fifty-five \n\nAs I pulled away slowly, feelin' so holy, \n\nGod knows I was feelin' alive \n\nAnd now the sun's comin' up, yes it is \n\nI'm ridin' with Lady Luck \n\nFreeway cars and trucks \n\nFreeway cars and trucks, \n\nRidin' with Lady Luck \n\nFreeway cars and trucks, \n\nRidin' with Lady Luck \n\nFreeway cars and trucks \n\nRidin' with Lady Luck...",
