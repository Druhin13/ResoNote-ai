  "lyrics": "Aye, done everything and done it again\r\nNot everybody needs attendance\r\nDon't take this as complaining\r\nJust little rearrangements of the mess that we've been taking\r\nBaby we can take one off\n\n\n\nBody companion's, body in a mansion\n\nBut I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight\n\nWanna step over, we don't gotta slow down\n\nNot like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight\n\nAh, I just wanna, I just wanna hold tight\n\nWanna step over, we don't gotta slow down\n\nNot like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight\n\n\n\nAhh, Not like I wanna keep you inside, yeah\n\nAhh, but I was hoping we can switch up how we're spending our time\n\n\n\nDon't take this as complaining\n\nJust little rearrangements, of the mess that we've been taking\n\nBaby, we can take one off\n\n\n\nBody companion's, body in a mansion\n\nBut I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight\n\nWanna step over, we don't gotta slow down\n\nNot like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight\n\nAh, I just wanna, I just wanna hold tonight\n\nWanna step over, we don't gotta slow down\n\nNot like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight\n\n\n\nI just want that hand hold, with the sweat in the metal\n\nRunning down, or when I feel alone and I'm feeling gone\n\nYou can touch it a lil', hit me underneath the covers\n\nColor where your body weed and real\n\nTake you to Bahamas, sleeping through the sun\n\nSoaking on that silence, now I'm in the air\n\nTelling you baby to listen, not just-\n\nWanna keep you in, wanna keep you in, babe\n\nWanna feel your skin, wanna feel it in right\n\nMaybe I've been on the internet forgetting how to keep it slow\n\nI know I need it really bad, boom body, clock, come and get it\n\nI don't know I get it, get it, or I get it or-\n\n\n\nBody companion's, body in a mansion\n\nBut I like where my hands is, I just wanna hold tight\n\nWanna step over, we don't gotta slow down\n\nNot like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight\n\nAh, I just wanna, I just wanna hold tonight\n\nWanna step over, we don't gotta slow down\n\nNot like we don't know how, I just wanna hold tight",
