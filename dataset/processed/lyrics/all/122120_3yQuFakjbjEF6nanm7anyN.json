New excuses\n\nThere you are, same old you shit\n\nBet you need a favour, find a girl on your radar\n\nI ain't never gonna save ya, never again\n\nSail on, ooo, I don't want you, yeah\n\nBaby, you must be dumb\n\nI can't feel the way that you are\n\nCan't you hear the tone? I don't wanna know\n\n\n\nDon't you ever call me again love\n\nDon't you ever call me your friend, no\n\nDon't you try, don't you try\n\nFunny how they think that they know us\n\nYou ain't laughing now there is no us\n\nYou and I, you and I\n\nTake me back around to the place where you first found me\n\nI won't let you in no, I won't let you round me\n\nDon't you ever call me your friend love\n\nDon't you ever call me again, no\n\nNo reply, no reply\n\n\n\nDon't you ever, don't you ever no no\n\nYou and I, you and I",
