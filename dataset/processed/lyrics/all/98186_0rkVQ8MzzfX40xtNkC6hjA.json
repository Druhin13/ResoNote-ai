  "lyrics": "Open up my shallow mind, take a bit to realign, these dots I didn't choose, maybe that goes for you, I check before I settle in and go you back to missin' in, I watched before I fall again and now I know this is the end. \nShe said I'm losing my mind, \nI said I'm losing my friends, I've got a lot to learn, I've got a lot to mend and I can chase in my heart, back to the star, maybe I'm fine, in my whole heart. And I can chase in my heart . Back to the star, maybe I'm fine, \n\n\nin my whole heart. \n\n\n\nI've been looking for the answer, but I just can break through and you can take my fault in an answer, is this what we've come to and I've waste in my trust all the time, that I've lost try to find what's wrong with me and now where are we? Chase in my heart, back to the star. She said I'm losing my mind, I said I'm losing my friends, I've got a lot to learn, I've got a lot to mend and I can chase in my heart, back to the star, maybe I'm fine, in my whole heart. Back to the star, maybe I'm fine, in my whole heart. And I can chase in my heart, back to the star, maybe I'm fine, in my whole heart. And I can chase in my heart, back to the star . Maybe I'm fine, in my whole heart.",
