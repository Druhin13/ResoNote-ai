  "lyrics": "Stare through the break in the trees\r\nAnd step down in the frequency\r\nCatch your breath and transgress\r\nYou'll make more here with less\r\nPress me into the cracks in the rocks\n\nHear the hum in the trees\n\nWe came down through the valley\n\nTo catch-up with the sea\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding me down and let me catch your breath\n\nHolding me down and let me catch your breath\n\n\n\nLet's roll and sigh\n\nLet's love her speed and stride\n\nFeel ourselves increasingly wide\n\nCarry the meaning inside\n\n\n\nCatch your breath and transgress\n\nWe'll make more here with less\n\nHold my tongue to a song\n\nLet go of words when words steer us wrong\n\n\n\n\n\nHolding me down and let me catch your breath\n\nHolding me down and let me catch your breath\n\nHolding me down and let me catch your breath\n\nHolding me down and let me catch your breath",
