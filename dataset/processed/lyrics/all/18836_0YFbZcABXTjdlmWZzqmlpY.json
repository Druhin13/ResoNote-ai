  "lyrics": "It takes character to make a decision\r\nIt takes more to stand firm and follow through\r\nBut some stand points are more than I can live up to\r\nPerformed an exorcism on myself\r\nCited prayers and rites of deliverance\n\nYet here I am, somehow still possessed\n\n\n\nThe future's never starting\n\nThe present never ends\n\nI left us both bombarded\n\nBut I'm not here to make amends\n\n\n\nFondling the thighs of forfeit\n\nI guess I can't brush aside\n\nI'm waiting for the day the music dies\n\n\n\nOh the places one looks for makeshift\n\nI tried to ruin myself for you\n\nHoping that you'd rather resent than miss\n\n\n\nHow can one kill an impulsion\n\nWhen it's still kicking and breathing\n\nForces are a cut above the will of the self\n\n\n\nThe future's never starting\n\nThe present never ends\n\nI left us both bombarded\n\nBut I'm not here to make amends\n\n\n\nFondling the thighs of forfeit\n\nI guess I can't brush aside\n\nI'm waiting for the day the music dies\n\n\n\nJumping from one bosom to the next\n\nHitting every branch in the fall\n\nBeaten to a pulp by every caress\n\nIn the tempest, unaffected by it all\n\nAnd Iâ€™m hoping that the end is nigh\n\nI'm waiting for the day the music\n\nWaiting for the day the music dies",
