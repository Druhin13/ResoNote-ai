  "lyrics": "All the lights go down as I crawl into the spaces\r\nFight, flight, or the screams, life tearing at the seams\r\nWait, I don't ever want to be here\r\nLike punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare\n\nIf it falls apart I will surely wake it\n\nBright lights turn me green, this is worse than it seems\n\n\n\nWait, I don't ever want to be here\n\nLike punching in a dream, breathing life into my nightmare\n\n\n\nThey’ll get through, they’ll get you\n\nIn the place that you fear it the most\n\nIn the corner, where it’s warmer\n\nIn the face that you wish was a ghost\n\n\n\nWait, I don't ever want to be here\n\nLike punching in a dream breathing life into the nightmare\n\nWait, I don't ever want to be here\n\nLike punching in a dream breathing life into the nightmare",
