  "lyrics": "When I thought my world was over\r\nCouldn't get me out of bed\r\nBut the dreams they kept rolling\r\nThought I couldn't get ahead\r\nWell you know I tried praying\n\nTried to wish it all away\n\nEven tried meditating\n\nBut the feelings stay the same\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not in control\n\nI'm not cut out for this\n\nSo I took it back to New York\n\nAnd cried to my mom, oh\n\nI thought I'd know me by now\n\n\n\nSo I went see a doctor\n\nHe said I look mighty fine\n\nBut when I went to see the joker\n\nHe knew something's on my mind\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say it's all about delivery\n\nSaid it's all about my stance\n\nWell the thing I like about you\n\nIs you love me, oh you love me\n\nOoo you love me, you love me\n\nLove me all the while\n\n\n\nYou love me, you love me\n\nYou love me, you love me",
