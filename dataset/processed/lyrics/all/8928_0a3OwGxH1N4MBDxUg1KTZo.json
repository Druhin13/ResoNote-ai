  "lyrics": "I used to want to kill myself, I used to want to die\r\nI used to drink myself to sleep at night\r\nAnd I'm afraid that Jesus Christ will take me tonight\r\nI used to want to blow my brains out in a crowded room\r\nI used to want to drown myself in every swimming pool that I would see\n\nI used to blame everyone else but me\n\nBecause I was so fucked up\n\n\n\nInto the darkest night I'll take you by my side\n\nInto the summer sun we won't just come undone\n\nAnd all my life, all my life I've waited to kiss your perfect face\n\nInto the darkest night I'll take you by my side\n\n\n\nI love the way that you wear those ribbons in your hair\n\nAnd have I told you that you saved me from the despair that was choking me\n\nI'm so thankful that I get to breathe\n\n\n\nI love the way that you don't give a fuck what anyone thinks\n\nAnd I'm trying so hard to think like that\n\nBut I'm the singer in a fucking band and I'm still neurotic as shit\n\n\n\nInto the darkest night I'll take you by my side\n\nInto the summer sun we won't just come undone\n\nAnd all my life, all my life I've waited to kiss your perfect face\n\nInto the darkest night I'll take you by my side\n\n\n\nMy love for you will never die until the flesh rots off my bones and I am smashed into a million flakes of dust\n\nI won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie, this could save your life\n\nI'm so afraid that everything that's wrong with me will become part of you and you will never see\n\nI won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie, this could save my life\n\n\n\nMy love for you will never die\n\nMy love for you will never die\n\nMy love for you will never die\n\nMy love for you will never die\n\n\n\nInto the darkest night I'll take you by my side\n\nInto the summer sun we won't just come undone\n\nAnd all my life, all my life I've waited to kiss your perfect face\n\nInto the darkest night I'll take you by my side\n\n\n\nI won't lie, I won't lie, I won't lie",
