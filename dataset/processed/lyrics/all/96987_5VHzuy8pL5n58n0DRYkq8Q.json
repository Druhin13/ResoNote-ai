  "lyrics": "Baby, I was way past the point of saving\r\nBut you didn't try to save me, you just let it be\r\nCalled me up, \"Say, let's go get a drink\"\r\nWe don't even have to say a thing\r\nBut we talked a while 'bout our dreams\n\nOur lives, our saints\n\nHow you like to hear me sing\n\n\n\nI guess I always knew there was something more to you\n\nIf my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine\n\nYour gold love gets me through\n\nGets me through, gets me through\n\n\n\nFascinated by the facets of me I hated\n\nThe beauty that I kept shaded\n\nYou brought the sun around\n\nSaid I'm too good to be on the ground\n\nYou wanna hold me, but you'll never hold me down\n\n\n\nYeah, you saw the hurt through the pain\n\nSaw the sparks through the rain\n\nAfter that drink, I never was the same\n\n\n\nI guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you\n\nIf my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine\n\nYour gold love gets me through\n\nGets me through, gets me through\n\nI guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you\n\nIf my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine\n\nYour gold love gets me through\n\nGets me through, gets me through\n\n\n\nYeah, I guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you\n\nSilver lining just won't do\n\nYour gold love will get me through\n\nYeah, I guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you\n\nSilver lining just won't do\n\nYour gold love will get me through\n\n\n\nI guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you\n\nIf my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine\n\nYour gold love gets me through\n\nGets me through, gets me through\n\nI guess I always knew\n\n(Yeah, I guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you)\n\nThere was something more to you\n\n(Silver lining just won't do\n\nYour gold love will get me through)\n\nIf my stars burn out of light, if my diamond loses shine\n\n(Yeah, I guess I always knew\n\nThere was something more to you)\n\nYour gold love gets me through\n\nGets me through, gets me through\n\n(Silver lining just won't do\n\nYour gold love will get me through)",
