  "lyrics": "Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation\r\nThis a real nigga celebration, this a Dime Blocc declaration\r\nFifty-Ninth and Fifth Ave, granny's house with vanilla wafers\r\nThis the remedy, the separation, 2Pac of my generation\r\nBlue pill in the fuckin' Matrix, red rose in the gray pavement\r\nYoung black nigga trapped and he can't change it\n\nKnow he a genius, he just can't claim it\n\n'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it\n\nHe frustrated so he get faded\n\nBut deep down inside he know you can't fade him\n\nHow long should I stay dedicated?\n\nHow long 'til opportunity meet preparation?\n\nI need some real nigga reparations\n\n'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation\n\n\n\nDedication, hard work plus patience\n\nThe sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'\n\nI'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'\n\nNow you hear what I been sayin', dedication\n\nIt's dedication, look\n\n\n\nI spent my whole life thinkin' out the box\n\nBoxin' homies three on one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop\n\nChirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block\n\nThey blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie\n\nI spent my whole life starin' at the stage\n\nPlayin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades\n\nCatchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades\n\nThat's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways\n\nI spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it\n\nThe cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it\n\nYou take a loss, shit don't cry about it, just embrace it\n\nMinor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite\n\nMy nigga L said you do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better crip\n\nI said he a man first, you hear the words out his lips?\n\nAbout flourishing from the streets to black businesses?\n\nLevel four, yard livin' and give in to false imprisonment\n\nListen close my nigga, it's bigger than deuces and fours my nigga\n\nSince elementary we close my nigga, yeah, straight like that\n\nI give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back\n\nFor generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans\n\nProve your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's\n\nI'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop\n\nDamn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication\n\n\n\nIf it ain't congratulate then it look like hate\n\nIf it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?\n\nHol' up!\n\n\n\nThis ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship\n\nThese songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves wit\n\nEnded up on shore to their amazement\n\nI hope the example I set's not contagious\n\nLock us behind gates but can't tame us\n\nUsed to be stay safe, now it's stay dangerous\n\n'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense nigga\n\nThat's why I dove off the deep end nigga, without a life jacket\n\nCouple mil, tour the world, now my life crackin'\n\nCook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes\n\nRoyalties, publishing, plus I own masters\n\nI'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers\n\nI was mappin' this out, I hit the heights backwards\n\nHoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok classics\n\nRan a couple marathons just to get established\n\nTo make it happen, you got to have it\n\n\n\nDedication, hard work plus patience\n\nThe sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'\n\nI'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'\n\nNow you hear what I been sayin', dedication\n\nIt's dedication",
