  "lyrics": "I'm just like my mother, she sighed\r\nOnly she hides it better\r\nI see colours in words\r\nI'll draw pictures for you\r\nCome hear me speak about my longings\n\nAll my goodness, all my cruelty\n\nWhen was the last time I cried?\n\nTruth be told I can't remember\n\n\n\nThere was once a man who loved me\n\nHe was older, he left a scar\n\nAnd a book about an angel\n\nWho made her way back home to God\n\n\n\nI still think about him sometimes\n\nRunning my finger up its spine\n\nMay he fall into a well\n\nHe left me old before my time\n\n\n\nSo I'm writing this here song\n\nOut on a sick bag just for you\n\nIn the hopes that in the process\n\nI might conjure up a few scenarios\n\nFilled with old ghosts\n\nWho wander round dressed in your clothes\n\n\n\nCome over here you fucked up muse\n\nRead me Sassoon\n\nOut of your head on altar wine\n\n\n\nShe paused for air, she bit her lip\n\nPicked the candle, struck the match\n\nThe smoke, the flame, the glow\n\nThe Persian curtains start to dance\n\n\n\nFix your eyes upon this mirror\n\nLet me grab my spirit level\n\nSwear you'll keep me safe forever\n\nTell the truth and shame the devil\n\n\n\nSo I'm writing this here song\n\nOut on a sick bag just for you\n\nIn the hopes that in the process\n\nI might conjure up a few scenarios\n\nFilled with old ghosts\n\nWho wander round dressed in old suits\n\nBusy trying to compose\n\nOther anthems for doomed youth\n\n\n\nAnd the coin toss will decide\n\nWho's taking home the virgin bride\n\nWho knits a dress of golden silk\n\nFor you to dance through gold and milk\n\nI swapped the key for the long spade\n\nMade Areto dig her own grave\n\n\n\nCome over here you fucked up muse\n\nRead me Sassoon\n\nOut of your head on altar wine\n\n\n\nOut of your head on altar wine",
