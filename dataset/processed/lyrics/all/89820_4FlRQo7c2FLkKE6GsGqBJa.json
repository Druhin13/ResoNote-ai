  "lyrics": "Don't ya know that you drive me crazy?\r\nI've been dreaming about ya lately\r\nMy eyes, they look than what they're given\r\nAnd honey, told you all I see is heaven\r\nBalance me with your sweet psychedelic candy\n\nBalance me with your sweet psychedelic candy\n\n\n\nI left a little bit, a piece of me in you\n\nThe secret that we have is what we have is true\n\nI feel your energy bouncing on my skin\n\nA self discovery is now about to begin\n\n\n\nBalance me with your sweet psychedelic candy\n\nBalance me with your sweet psychedelic candy\n\n\n\nDon't ya know?\n\nDon't forget\n\nYou're the one that I love\n\nDon't ya know?\n\nDon't ya get?\n\nYou're the one my heart wants\n\n\n\nBalance me with your sweet psychedelic candy\n\nBalance me with your sweet psychedelic candy",
