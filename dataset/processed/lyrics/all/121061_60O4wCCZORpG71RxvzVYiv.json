  "lyrics": "I'm so tired of being here\r\nSuppressed by all my childish fears\r\nAnd if you have to leave\r\nI wish that you would just leave\r\n'Cause your presence still lingers here\r\nAnd it won't leave me alone\n\n\n\nThese wounds won't seem to heal\n\nThis pain is just too real\n\nThere's just too much that \n\ntime cannot erase\n\n\n\nWhen you cried I'd wipe away \n\nall of your tears\n\nWhen you'd scream I'd fight away \n\nall of your fears\n\nI held your hand through \n\nall of these years\n\nBut you still have\n\nAll of me\n\n\n\nYou used to captivate me\n\nBy your resonating light\n\nNow I'm bound by the life \n\nyou left behind\n\nYour face it haunts\n\nMy once pleasant dreams\n\nYour voice it chased away\n\nAll the sanity in me\n\n\n\nThese wounds won't seem to heal\n\nThis pain is just too real\n\nThere's just too much that \n\ntime cannot erase\n\n\n\nWhen you cried I'd wipe away \n\nall of your tears\n\nWhen you'd scream I'd fight away \n\nall of your fears\n\nI held your hand through \n\nall of these years\n\nBut you still have\n\nAll of me\n\n\n\nI've tried so hard to tell myself \n\nthat you're gone\n\nBut though you're still with me\n\nI've been alone all along\n\n\n\nWhen you cried I'd wipe away \n\nall of your tears\n\nWhen you'd scream I'd fight away \n\nall of your fears\n\nI held your hand through \n\nall of these years\n\nBut you still have\n\nAll of me, me, me",
