  "lyrics": "Under the knife I surrendered\r\nThe innocence your's to consume\r\nYou cut it away\r\nAnd you filled me up with hate\r\nInto the silence you sent me\r\nInto the fire consumed\n\nYou thought I'd forget\n\nBut it's always in my head\n\n\n\nYou're the pulse in my veins\n\nYou're the war that I wage\n\nCan you change me?\n\nCan you change me?\n\nYou're the love that I hate\n\nYou're the drug that I take\n\nWill you cage me?\n\nWill you cage me?\n\nYou're the pulse in my veins\n\nYou're the war that I wage\n\nCan you change me?\n\nCan you change me?\n\nFrom the monster you made me?\n\nThe monster you made me?\n\n\n\nThis is the world you've created\n\nThe product of what I've become\n\nMy soul and my youth\n\nSeems it's all for you to use\n\nIf I could take back the moment\n\nI'd let you get under my skin\n\nRelent or resist\n\nSeems the monster always wins\n\n\n\nYou're the pulse in my veins\n\nYou're the war that I wage\n\nCan you change me?\n\nCan you change me?\n\nYou're the love that I hate\n\nYou're the drug that I take\n\nWill you cage me?\n\nWill you cage me?\n\nYou're the pulse in my veins\n\nYou're the war that I wage\n\nCan you change me?\n\nCan you change me?\n\nFrom the monster you made me?\n\nThe monster you made me?\n\n\n\nMy heart's an artifice, a decoy soul\n\nI lift you up and then I let you go\n\nI've made an art of digging shallow holes\n\nI drop the darkness in and watch it grow\n\nMy heart's an artifice, a decoy soul\n\nWho knew the emptiness could be so cold?\n\nI've lost the parts of me that make me whole\n\nI am the darkness\n\nI'm a monster\n\n\n\nYou're the pulse in my veins\n\nYou're the war that I wage\n\nCan you change me?\n\nCan you change me?\n\nYou're the love that I hate\n\nYou're the drug that I take\n\nWill you cage me?\n\nWill you cage me?\n\nYou're the pulse in my veins\n\nYou're the war that I wage\n\nCan you change me?\n\nCan you change me?\n\nFrom the monster you made me?\n\nThe monster you made me?\n\nThe monster you made me?\n\nThe monster you made me?",
