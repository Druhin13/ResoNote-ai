  "lyrics": "Heartbreak Saturday nights, getting ready\r\nTo make you see that I'm better already\r\nI put on every perfume\r\nAnd I do it to hurt you\r\nAnd oh\n\nMake sure I smell like your bedroom when I was in it\n\nWearing the dress that I met you in, sent you spinning\n\nAnd I flirt with your friends\n\nBut it's a beggar's revenge\n\n'Cause she's with you again\n\nAnd I try to look away\n\n\n\n'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours, and I should know better but I\n\nCan't forget, won't forget how it was before\n\nOh it felt forever, baby\n\nWe should still be holding on\n\nI should still put on your coat\n\nAnd when the music dies out\n\nYou should still take me home\n\n'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours still\n\n\n\nThis dress too nice for a jacket, so I'm freezing\n\nYou're walking past and on habit, I lean in\n\nClose to your toes 'cause I still think they're in us\n\nI know I should give it up\n\nOh\n\n\n\nFeel's like half of me's missing\n\nBut there's no hope\n\nYou don't care who I'm kissing\n\nWhen the lights go\n\nOh I know, I know that you don't\n\n\n\n'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours, and I should know better but I\n\nCan't forget, won't forget how it was before\n\nOh it felt forever, baby\n\nWe should still be holding on\n\nI should still put on your coat\n\nAnd when the music dies out\n\nYou should still take me home\n\n'Cause in my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours\n\nIn my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours\n\n\n\nOh, I'm still hurting and I'm still here\n\nYou're still not looking at me, my dear\n\nI'll watch you leaving, I'll watch you go\n\nAnd I'll say nothing\n\nBut we both know\n\n\n\nIn my head, in my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours, mm\n\nIn my head, in my head, in my head, in my head\n\nI'm yours",
