  "lyrics": "I've felt the cold under my skin\r\nI've hunted down for nothin' now\r\nAnd why's it always have to end like this?\r\nBe mystical, but sensible and I'll hold my tongue\r\nCould it be another memory we've missed?\n\nIf you feel nothin' anymore, then walk away from this\n\nAnd I thought I knew what I wanted\n\nWhat makes you so damn comfortable will only end in tears\n\nOh, and we've got something like this\n\n\n\nMy centrefold's made up of bones, but they hold nothing now\n\nAn empty cage to lockdown everything you need\n\nThree wishes won't free me at all, you got my tongue\n\nStill I hold on, here's everything we bleed\n\n\n\nIf you feel nothin' anymore, then walk away from this\n\nAnd I thought I knew what I wanted\n\nWhat makes you so damn comfortable will only end in tears\n\nOh, and we've got something like this\n\n\n\nIf you feel nothing anymore, then walk away from this\n\nAnd I thought I knew what I wanted\n\nWhat makes you so damn comfortable will only end in tears\n\nOh, and we've got something like this",
