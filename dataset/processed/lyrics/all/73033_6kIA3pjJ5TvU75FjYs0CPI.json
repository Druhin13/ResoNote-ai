  "lyrics": "Back-stab me one more time \nI swear it'll be the last time\nThis is your last goodbye\nNo getting away with this lie\nThe demon takes his throne\nHe waits until your all alone\n\nNo thought no regret\n\nMy anger's real it's not a threat\n\n\n\nYou knocked me down and now you're head is mine\n\nYes i'm the one you fear you can't deny\n\nThere's nowhere left for you to run and hide\n\nYou're running out of time\n\n\n\nThrown down on the floor\n\nYes i'm the one who wants it more\n\nBeat you bleed you dry\n\nDon't you run don't even try\n\nSpit out on your face\n\nI hope you taste your blood, disgrace \n\nBlood stains my hand tonight\n\nYou'll never win this fight\n\n\n\nYou knocked me down and now you're head is mine\n\nYes i'm the one you fear you can't deny\n\nThere's nowhere left for you to run and hide\n\nYou're running out of time",
