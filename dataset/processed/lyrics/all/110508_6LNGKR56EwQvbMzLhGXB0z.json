  "lyrics": "Moving miles apart\r\nBreathing the same old air\r\nWatch another way turn\r\nTurn till it goes nowhere\r\nWaiting down the [?]\r\nFinding the same old God\n\nEverything is undone\n\nNobody said it's fair\n\nThese ways don't open any doors\n\n\n\nYou're breaking me in two\n\nLiving like I'm cast away\n\nI'm falling back into\n\nWhat feels like another day\n\nSitting through a quiet storm\n\nWaiting for an empty nest\n\nYou're breaking me in two\n\nLiving like I'm cast away\n\n\n\nDrowning under my breath\n\nStare from across the street\n\nJust a second too late\n\nWaiting all of these years\n\nI stand alone in my heart\n\nMay coming out of me\n\nTry remember your face\n\nIt's always incomplete\n\n\n\nYou're breaking me in two\n\nLiving like I'm cast away\n\nI'm falling back into\n\nWhat feels like another day\n\nSitting through a quiet storm\n\nWaiting for an empty nest\n\nYou're breaking me in two\n\nLiving like I'm cast away\n\n\n\nSwimming all alone in the chaos\n\nWatching all the planes as they take off\n\nTell me, is it now or forever? Ever, ever, ever\n\n\n\nYou're breaking me in two\n\nLiving like I'm cast away\n\nI'm falling back into\n\nWhat feels like another day\n\nSitting through a quiet storm\n\nWaiting for an empty nest\n\nYou're breaking me in two\n\nLiving like I'm cast away",
