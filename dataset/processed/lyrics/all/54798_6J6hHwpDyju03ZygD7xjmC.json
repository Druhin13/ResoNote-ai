  "lyrics": "I'm gonna hold on to you\r\nJust to make sure you won't leave this time for good\r\nNobody feels any pain, mmh\r\nTonight as I'm standing in the rain for good, yeah\r\nI wanna show you\n\nThe way to little less drinks on the table\n\nI wanna show you\n\nBut I'm a little less, little less able\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna hold, hold on\n\nI'm gonna hold, hold on\n\nAnd I know my words won't be heard\n\n'Cause I hurt you like no one before\n\nSo I'm gonna hold, hold on\n\n\n\nI know that I've crossed your line\n\nAnd I've been a fool too many times before\n\n\n\nI wanna show you\n\nThe way to little less drinks on the table\n\nI wanna show you\n\nBut I'm a little less, little less able\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna hold, hold on\n\nI'm gonna hold, hold on\n\nAnd I know my words won't be heard\n\n'Cause I hurt you like no one before\n\nSo I'm gonna hold, hold on\n\n\n\nI know my words won't be heard\n\n'Cause I hurt you like no one before\n\nSo I'm gonna hold",
