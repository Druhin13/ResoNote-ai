  "lyrics": "Devil unkind always creeping in the blind\r\nWith shadows of the dearly departed\r\nPlanting the seed that in time will bloom to be\r\nTrouble that will rip you apart\r\nI cannot lie, I am barely holding on\n\nCaught in the mire I’ve come to know for way too long\n\nDrawn to the light but now the light is dead and gone\n\nIf there is a God, why did he take my father’s soul\n\n\n\nI cannot fight this worried mind\n\nIn the end, it’s all my fault\n\nThe fate you find, you choose in time\n\nWhen you draw the Devil on the wall\n\n\n\nVoices inside, they keep screaming in my head\n\nA choir of anguish pulling me into the dark\n\nA slow-moving calm that I am needing left for dead\n\nSolace to me, it seems to be so very far\n\n\n\nI cannot fight this worried mind\n\nIn the end, it’s all my fault\n\nThe fate you find, you choose in time\n\nWhen you draw the Devil on the wall\n\n\n\nThe Devil unkind always creeping in the blind\n\nWith shadows of the dearly departed\n\nPlanting the seed that in time will bloom to be\n\nTrouble that will rip you apart\n\n\n\n\n\nI cannot fight this worried mind\n\nIn the end, it’s all my fault\n\nThe fate you find, you choose in time\n\nWhen you draw the Devil on the wall\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nWhen you draw the Devil on the wall\n\nYeah",
