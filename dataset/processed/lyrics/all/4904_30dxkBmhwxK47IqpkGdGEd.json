  "lyrics": "Took a step in the night, didn't know I was ready\r\nTook a shot in the dark but I knew You would show me\r\nPut my feet on the path but I'm stepping in your shadow\r\nNot sure where to land but I knew how to follow\r\nBut as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nI know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nYou're my guiding light, light, light\n\n\n\nYou show me the way and I hit the ground running\n\nEvery step that I took didn't know what was coming\n\nWhen the days got long and the road got narrow\n\nI remember what you said that I'd never be alone\n\n\n\nBut as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nI know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nYou're my guiding light, light, light\n\nYou're my guiding light, light, light\n\nLight, light\n\n\n\nNo, I'm not turning back even when the fight comes\n\nKeep pressing on, keep pressing on, keep pressing on\n\nNo, I'm not looking back even in the battle\n\nI keep pressing on, keep pressing on, keep pressing on, yeah\n\n\n\nEverywhere that I ran took me to the beginning\n\nWhen You called me Your son and\n\nYou said You would lead me\n\nEverything that I am is the man You made me\n\nEverything You've done made my life, made my life... worth living\n\n\n\nBut as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nI know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nYou're my guiding light, light, light\n\nYou're my guiding light, light, light\n\nI can see Your footsteps, I'm alright\n\nI'm walking, oh I'm walking\n\n\n\nAs long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm alright",
