  "lyrics": "When you're big\r\nAnd troubles seem so far\r\nYou put your belly up to the bar\r\nSquint your eyes\r\nYou can almost miss the dirt\r\nYou tell yourself\n\nIt couldn't hurt\n\n\n\nBut when you're small\n\nYou can't walk down the hall\n\nWhen you're small\n\nYou're not very big at all\n\n\n\nWhen you're low\n\nYou reach a certain point\n\nWhere you can't really see the point\n\nYou can try\n\nBut you can't see eye to eye\n\nYet when you're low then you really know\n\n\n\nWhen you're high\n\nIt's easier to fight\n\nWhen you're high\n\nYou don't have to know why\n\n\n\nWhen you're small\n\nYou don't have very far to fall\n\nWhen you're small\n\nYou feel like you belong\n\nWhen you're small\n\nYou can curl into a ball\n\nWhen you're small\n\nNo you're not very big at all",
