  "lyrics": "(Get drunk and get some money)\r\nDo you wanna see what life's like on\r\nThe outside of your inner circle, baby?\r\n(Get drunk and get some money)\r\nMisery loves company but you're\n\nStuck in seclusion, aren't you, baby?\n\n(So get drunk and get some money)\n\n\n\n'Cause even when the world calls out your name\n\nYou answer from a padded room, oh baby\n\nGolden medal pressed against your face\n\nYou usually spend the afternoon asleep on rose petals\n\nBut now you got\n\n\n\nThorns in your back\n\n'Cause you tried to grab one\n\nFor yourself 'cause you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\nAll of your friends say, \"Don't be the sad one\"\n\nLighten up, but you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\n\n\nTell me you don't wonder what your\n\nFeet look like on private beaches, baby?\n\n(Get drunk and get some money)\n\nAnd tell me you don't wish for something\n\nMore interesting than your own reflections?\n\n(So get drunk and get some money)\n\n\n\n'Cause even when the world calls out your name\n\nYou answer from a padded room, oh baby\n\nGolden medal pressed against your face\n\nYou usually spend the afternoon asleep on rose petals\n\nBut now you got\n\n\n\nThorns in your back\n\n'Cause you tried to grab one\n\nFor yourself 'cause you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\nAll of your friends say, \"Don't be the sad one\"\n\nLighten up, but you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\n\n\n(Get drunk and, get drunk and)\n\nThat contradicts the other thing\n\n(Get drunk and get some money)\n\n(Get drunk and, get drunk and)\n\nAnd then you come back and then you're like, and I was like\n\n(Get drunk and get some money)\n\nIt's your fault\n\nWhy you complaining about that shit that's your own fault?\n\n(Get drunk and, get drunk and)\n\nAnd then you're coming in\n\nYour sandals all wack\n\n(Get drunk and get some money)\n\nYou're gonna have to\n\nTag us in the first place\n\n(Get drunk and get some money)\n\nWhy don't you stay at home?\n\n\n\nThorns in your back\n\n'Cause you tried to grab one\n\nFor yourself 'cause you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\nAll of your friends say, \"Don't be the sad one\"\n\nLighten up, but you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\n\n\nThorns in your back\n\n'Cause you tried to grab one\n\nFor yourself 'cause you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it\n\nAll of your friends say, \"Don't be the sad one\"\n\nLighten up, but you can't help it\n\nKnow what it takes to live like the fast ones\n\nSo you try, 'cause you can't help it",
