  "lyrics": "Your band’s doing better than my band\r\nI’ll go to your shows, but I’m not gonna dance\r\nYou broke your wrist and got a cast on your hand, covered in peace signs\r\nYour sister cut your hair but she gave you bangs, what’d she do that for?\r\nYou’re semi precious, and kinda reckless\n\nI think you’re better on your own\n\nI got your message, I left my necklace\n\nI got the picture on my phone\n\nDon’t you think that you can do better?\n\nDon’t you think that you can do better?\n\n\n\nYour car won't start, you need a ride\n\nYou work at eight called me at nine\n\nBut I don't have your number in my phone anymore\n\nI saw you walking on the side of the road alone\n\n\n\nYou’re semi precious, and kinda reckless\n\nI think you’re better on your own\n\nI got your message, I left my necklace\n\nI got the picture on my phone\n\nDon’t you think that you can do better?\n\nDon’t you think that you can do better?\n\n\n\nI'm giving you up, I'm giving you over\n\nI'm giving you up, I'm giving you over\n\n\n\nYou’re semi precious, and kinda reckless\n\nI think you’re better on your own\n\nI got your message, I left my necklace\n\nI got the picture on my phone\n\nDon’t you think that you can do better?\n\nDon’t you think that you can do better?",
