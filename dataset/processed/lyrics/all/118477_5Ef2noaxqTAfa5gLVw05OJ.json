  "lyrics": "If only your walls happened to talk\r\nThey'd say you had a lot of selfish lovers\r\nGet what they want, hit and run away (ay)\r\nNot gonna lie, if I was your guy\r\nI would never treat you like the others\r\nIf you wanna ride, I'mma take you all the way (vas-y)\n\n\n\nSo let me go down, down, down, down\n\nYou don't even need to ask me\n\nI'mma go round, round, round, round\n\n'Til you've had enough\n\nLet me go down, down, down, down\n\nYou know that it makes me happy\n\nHearing you loud, loud, loud, loud\n\nWhen you feel my love\n\n\n\nDarling, yo-o-ou come first\n\nLet me give you what yo-o-ou deserve\n\nIf I'mma love you, make you\n\nFeel like you're the only one\n\nThen yo-o-ou come first, uh\n\n\n\nCome, come yo-o-ou\n\nCome, come yo-o-ou\n\n\n\nWanna adore ya, let me explore ya\n\nBring ya right back to mother nature\n\nI wanna know how to get you to that place (ay)\n\nSo what do you like? Tell me your vice\n\nI don't wanna love in moderation\n\nIf you wanna ride, I'mma take you all the way (vas-y)\n\n\n\nSo let me go down, down, down, down\n\nYou don't even need to ask me\n\nI'mma go round, round, round, round\n\n'Til you feel my love\n\n\n\nDarling, yo-o-ou come first\n\nLet me give you what yo-o-ou deserve\n\nIf I'mma love you, make you\n\nFeel like you're the only one\n\nThen yo-o-ou come first\n\n\n\nLook, uh\n\nI be going back and forth if I should keep you\n\nYou know I'm careful who I go and give the keys to\n\nI need a man to be around when I need him\n\nMake sure that I come first in the sheets too (ha-ha)\n\nEvery night you probably pray for this\n\nBut understand you ain't dealing with no basic bitch\n\nI be H-I-G-H maintenance\n\nNow you see why Saweetie don't play with tricks\n\n'Cos I be onto the next, if you don't come correct\n\nNah I'm all 'bout respect, like the ice on my neck\n\nI be running up a cheque, watch a bitch work\n\nTry and keep up baby but I finish first\n\n\n\nOh, I'll be patient with your body\n\nI wait forever and a day\n\nAnd if I ever fail you darling\n\nLet me know, so I can learn from my mistakes\n\n\n\n'Cos darling, yo-o-ou come first\n\nLet me give you what yo-o-ou deserve\n\nIf I'mma love you, make you\n\nFeel like you're the only one\n\nThen yo-o-ou come first",
