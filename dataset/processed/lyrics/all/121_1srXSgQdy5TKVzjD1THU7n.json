  "lyrics": "Grief is the cost of love, and I'm not rich enough\r\nI'm not rich enough\r\nThoughts put me back to that bar where I can't stand up\r\nTry to find\r\nTry to find the exact moment when you turned it off\r\nBefore you walked out on me\n\n\n\nI don't feel love\n\nI can't feel you anymore\n\nI don't feel love\n\nI can't feel you anymore\n\n\n\nIf you play with a heart enough it turns to dust\n\nIt turns to dust\n\nWhen you cut out the middle, you're living with a husk\n\nWhen I call out your name and you don't answer back\n\nI spiral down, down, down, down\n\nDown into the black\n\n\n\nI don't feel love\n\nI can't feel you anymore\n\nI don't feel love\n\nI can't feel you anymore, anymore\n\n\n\nYou see I can't see through this understanding\n\nI can't see what you want me to say\n\nYou throw the past at me like a stone and\n\nKicking my dust in my bloodied face\n\n\n\nTry to find\n\nTry to find the exact moment when you turned it off\n\nBefore you walked out on me\n\n\n\nI don't feel love\n\nI can't feel you anymore\n\nI don't feel love\n\nI can't feel you anymore, anymore\n\n\n\nYou see just where to lay me open\n\nI stay around just drinking my pain\n\nYou throw my words at me like a stone and\n\nSpit my lies back in my bloodied face",
