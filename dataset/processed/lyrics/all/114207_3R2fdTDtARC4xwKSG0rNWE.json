Lord, I ask my son \"Why it is just thugs here, hanging away?\" He looked at me and said \"Pops, I'm staying dangerous.\" Help me Lord, I tried to tell him there are many ways to stay dangerous. Power is dangerous, knowledge is dangerous, having them dollars is dangerous. He just looked at me Lord and said \"Pops, I'm talking dangerous.\"",
