  "lyrics": "If you ever need to hear a voice in the middle of the night\r\nWhen it seems so black outside that you can't remember\r\nLight ever shone on you or the ones you love in this or another lifetime\r\nAnd the voice you need to hear is the true and the trusted kind, with a soft\r\nFamiliar rhythm in these swirling, unsure times, when the waves are lapping in\n\nAnd you're not sure you can swim, well here's the lifeline\n\n\n\nIf you ever need to feel a hand take up your own\n\nWhen you least expect but want it more than you've ever known\n\nBaby, here's that hand, and baby's here's my voice that's calling\n\n\n\nThis is love, all that ever was and will be\n\nThis is love\n\n\n\nIf you ever need some proof that time can heal your wounds, just step\n\nInside my heart and walk around these rooms; where the shadows used to be,\n\nYou can feel as well as see how peace can hover\n\n\n\nTime's been here to fix what's broken with its power and the love that\n\nSmashed us both to bits spent its last few hours calling out your name,\n\nAnd I thought, this is the kind of pain from which we don't recover\n\n\n\nBut I'm standing here now with my heart held out to you\n\nYou would have thought a miracle was all that got us through\n\nWell baby, all I know, all I know is I'm still standing\n\n\n\nAnd this is love, all that ever was and will be\n\nThis is love, standing up for you baby, standing up for me\n\nAnd I see you still and there's this catch in my throat; \n\nAnd I just swallow hard till it leaves me\n\nThere's nothing in this world that can change what we know\n\nStill I know I am here if you ever need me\n\n\n\nAnd this is love \n\nIf you ever think of me, let it be around twilight, when the world has\n\nSettled down, and the last round of sunlight is waning in the sky as you\n\nSit and watch the night descending\n\n\n\nA car will pass out front with lovers at the wheel, a dog will bark out\n\nBack, and children's voices peal over and under the air, you've been there,\n\nLost in the remembering\n\n\n\nIf you ever wish for things that are only in the past\n\nJust remember that the wrong things aren't supposed to last\n\nBaby, it's over and done, the rest is gonna come when you let it\n\n\n\nAnd this is love, all that ever was and will be\n\nThis is love, when you let it baby, if you let it now\n\nThis is love, all that ever was and can be\n\nThis is love",
