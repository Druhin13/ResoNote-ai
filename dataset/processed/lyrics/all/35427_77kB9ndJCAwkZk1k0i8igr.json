  "lyrics": "I'm talkin' to God, but I don't think He heard\r\nSo took my problems to a man, don't know his name\r\nWrote on the wall, I came here to be seen\r\nAnd said to the floor these words all tear me free\r\nI left my heart at the bottom of the cache\n\nDrown in my thoughts, I'm just a helpless man\n\n\n\nAnd how can I stay?\n\nIt's over now\n\nAnd how can I change?\n\nIt all falls down\n\n\n\nSoar in the night, say your wicked praise\n\nI know why I can't play savior: I can't change my ways\n\nAnd I'm trying to find a way to paraphrase\n\nWords rollin' around my head, I echo into haze\n\nAnd echo into haze, and echo into haze\n\n\n\nAnd how can I stay?\n\nYeah, it's over now\n\nAnd how can I change?\n\nIt all falls down\n\n\n\nAnd how can I change my troubles into praise?\n\nAnd how can I wait? I'm runnin' all my days\n\nIt's over now, oh, it's over now\n\n\n\nAnd how can I stay?\n\nIt's over now\n\nAnd how can it change?\n\nIt all falls down",
