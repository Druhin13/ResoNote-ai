  "lyrics": "We suffer to survive\r\nAre we desperate creatures crawling in the dirt?\r\nOr are we lonely preachers hiding our beating hearts?\r\nWe sow the wind and reap the storm\r\nDon't say you haven't been warned\n\n\n\nNo future's written\n\nThere's endless possibility\n\n\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\nIf hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\nAm I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\n\n\nIn the kingdom resides behind my own eyes\n\nI've got to catch the stone and cradle the wave\n\nDamnation is just a daydream away\n\nBut still we carry on\n\nIf I'm God in disguise praying for the rain\n\nAnd if our demons decide, then is this all in vain?\n\n\n\nWe sow the wind and reap the storm\n\nDon't say you haven't been warned\n\n\n\nIt's time to confess\n\nI haunt this flesh\n\nI answer my own prayers\n\nI bid my own despair\n\n\n\nNo future's written\n\nThere's endless possibility\n\n\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\nIf hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\nAm I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\n\n\nBut still, we carry on\n\nThere's a lesson in this, what I resist persists\n\nAnd damnation is just a daydream away\n\n\n\nIf hope is a prison, then maybe faith will set me free\n\nWe suffer to survive\n\nAm I just a victim drifting in the raging sea?\n\nWe suffer to survive",
