  "lyrics": "One, two...\r\nHow many miles must it take to, breakthrough\r\nAnd how many hours must we wait through, to hear the truth\r\nHow many moments did I trade in, for a fake kiss\r\nHow many chances did I forfeit, too afraid to miss\n\n\n\nI feel your thunder pourin' like rain\n\nDown on the mountains of all my mistakes\n\nRolling like rivers, running with grace\n\nInto the ocean of your embrace\n\nYour hand of my side, leading the way\n\nTen thousand horses couldn't pull me away\n\nI hear the music, heaven has made\n\nOh when we're standing, standing\n\nFace to Face\n\nFace to Face\n\n\n\nHow many nights with regret do I swear through\n\nHow many lives in the rear view, do I compare too\n\n\n\nI feel your thunder pourin' like rain\n\nDown on the mountains of all my mistakes\n\nRolling like rivers, running with grace\n\nInto the ocean of your embrace\n\nYour hand of my side, leading the way\n\nTen thousand horses couldn't pull me away\n\nI hear the music, heaven has made\n\nOh when we're standing, standing\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\n\n\nHand on my side, leading the way\n\nTen thousand horses couldn't pull me away\n\nI hear the music, heaven has made\n\nOh when we're standing, standing\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face\n\nFace to face",
