  "lyrics": "[NIGHT FOUR]\r\nYellow eyes are seen circling... a whirlwind arriving for the passing storm\r\nThe hunt... the hunter inside\r\nA whirlwind arriving\r\nThe wanderer wanders too far from the gold distance\r\nWhere they live... where the quiet lay their drowning heads at night\n\nFlesh drapes on the smoking ground and then spills onto the teeth of the once protected\n\n(Yellow eyes close in)\n\n\n\nYellow\n\nOur souls grip onto a wall\n\nOur minds slip past this old soul\n\nYellow\n\n\n\n[MORNING FIVE]\n\nSmoke is seen in both directions\n\nMy creation sits... my progress awaits\n\nSmoke is seen in both directions\n\nIn rubble... their creation\n\nSomewhere in the distance... somewhere\n\nThe softness of snow mutes my travels\n\nSomewhere in the distance... somewhere\n\n\n\nThis landscape seems to change too often for comfort\n\nA blinking light hides as I stumble downward\n\nA stillness... it’s too quiet\n\nThe hum of electricity\n\nMy crumbling bones seem to weld the new author\n\nA stillness... it’s too quiet\n\nThe hum of electricity... seems to buzz\n\n\n\nCut an X in my palm... leave my mark\n\nA translation for whatever created this world for me\n\nI sit under the crimson moon\n\nWhatever created this world for me\n\nYours or mine?\n\nThey or this?\n\nYellow eyes\n\n\n\nTread light\n\nCollisions open on us more\n\nRevise\n\n\n\nThe simple task of our own\n\nWe serve our own hell\n\n\n\nA cocoon leaking our own conclusions\n\nWe serve our hell well\n\nCope with disguise\n\n\n\nInner working dissect\n\nCommon phase neglect\n\nI am tangible with no logic\n\n\n\nChange my focus, drown my spirits\n\nThere’s more to this than it may seem\n\n\n\nBlink fast into hollow ground...",
