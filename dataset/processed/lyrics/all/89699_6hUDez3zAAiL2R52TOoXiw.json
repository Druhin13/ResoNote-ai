  "lyrics": "I've always had trouble staying still\r\nI stand next to what I hate just for the trill\r\nSpent the first quarter of my life on a million dollar bill\r\n'Cause I can't stop staring at the fire\r\nWe got our crosses and our buildings, build 'em tall\r\nAnd my book's another brick inside the wall\n\nWe sure make ourselves feel busy, but we don't do much at all\n\nExcept sit around and stare at the fire\n\nAnd the protesters have gathered in the streets\n\nOpposite, a block full of police\n\nBut they both have the same problem with God as you and me\n\nIt's that they just can't stop staring at the fire\n\n\n\nWatch it burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch it burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch it burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch it burn, burn, burn\n\n\n\nAnd to an ashram a million miles from here\n\nAn old man on a blanket appeared\n\nHe waved me to come closer, and he whispered in my ear\n\n\"Son, you've got to stop staring at the fire\"\n\nBut all my ego trips come in flocks\n\nAnd they tell me, \"Kid, it's really not that hot\"\n\nTake your anxiety and your guilt, just throw it all on top\n\nNow I can't stop standing in the fire\n\n\n\nOh, watch me burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch me burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch me burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch me burn, burn, burn\n\nOh, watch me burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch me burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch me burn, burn, burn\n\nWatch me burn, burn, burn",
