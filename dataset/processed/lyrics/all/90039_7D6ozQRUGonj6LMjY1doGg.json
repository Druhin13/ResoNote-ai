  "lyrics": "So long, I've been looking too hard, I've been waiting too long \nSometimes I don't know what I will find, I only know it's a matter of time \nWhen you love someone, when you love someone \nIt feels so right, so warm and true, I need to know if you feel it too \nMaybe I'm wrong, won't you tell me if I'm coming on too strong \n\nThis heart of mine has been hurt before, this time I wanna be sure \n\n\n\nI've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life \n\nI've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive \n\nI've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive \n\nYeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life \n\n\n\nYou're so good, when we make love it's understood \n\nIt's more than a touch or a word can say \n\nOnly in dreams could it be this way \n\nWhen you love someone, yeah, really love someone \n\n\n\nNow I know it's right, from the moment I wake up till deep in the night \n\nThere's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be than holding you tenderly \n\n\n\nI've been waiting for a girl like you to come into my life \n\nI've been waiting for a girl like you, your loving will survive \n\nI've been waiting for someone new to make me feel alive \n\nYeah, waiting for a girl like you to come into my life \n\n\n\nI've been waiting, waiting for you, ooh, I've been waiting \n\nI've been waiting \n\n(I've been waiting for a girl like you, I've been waiting) \n\nWon't you come into my life?",
