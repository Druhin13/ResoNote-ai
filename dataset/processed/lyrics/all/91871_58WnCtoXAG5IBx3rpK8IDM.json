  "lyrics": "I see you waiting for a sign\r\nSome resolve to ease your mind\r\nMaybe you're not awake as we thought\r\nEvery hope within your dreams\r\nWasted on a faith in dead and dying things\r\nWither away into our grave\n\n\n\nI can see the forest for the trees, feel the wound before it bleeds\n\nI've been waiting for that debt to come and take me to my knees\n\nBut I can't wait for peace\n\nI can't wait for peace\n\n\n\nAnd we have seen tomorrow's lead\n\nLet's dwell in truth for once\n\nThere's no release\n\nEver we go into the cold\n\nEver we go, go it alone\n\n\n\nI can see the forest for the trees, feel the wound before it bleeds\n\nI've been waiting for that debt to come and take me to my knees\n\nBut I can't wait for peace\n\nI can't wait for peace\n\n\n\nIs it over, can we tell\n\nPeace or only Hell\n\nIf it seems to convalesce\n\nTry and hold your breath\n\nI know it's hard to abandon your path\n\nWhen this is all that you have\n\n\n\nI can see the forest for the trees, feel the wound before it bleeds\n\nI've been waiting for that debt to come and take me to my knees\n\nBut I can't wait for peace\n\nI can't wait for peace",
