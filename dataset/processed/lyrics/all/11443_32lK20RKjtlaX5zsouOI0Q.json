  "lyrics": "We're only young and naive still\r\nWe require certain skills\r\nThe mood it changes like the wind\r\nHard to control when it begins\r\nThe bittersweet between my teeth\n\nTrying to find the in-betweens\n\nFall back in love eventually\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n\n\nCan't help myself but count the flaws\n\nClaw my way out through these walls\n\nOne temporary escape\n\nFeel it start to permeate\n\n\n\nWe lie beneath the stars at night\n\nOur hands gripping each other tight\n\nYou keep my secrets hope to die\n\nPromises, swear them to the sky\n\n\n\nThe bittersweet between my teeth\n\nTrying to find the in-betweens\n\nFall back in love eventually\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n\n\nAs it withers\n\nBrittle it shakes\n\nCan you whisper\n\nAs it crumbles and breaks\n\nAs you shiver\n\nCount up all your mistakes\n\nPair of forgivers\n\nLet go before it's too late\n\nCan you whisper\n\nCan you whisper\n\nCan you whisper\n\nCan you whisper\n\n\n\nThe bittersweet between my teeth\n\nTrying to find the in-betweens\n\nFall back in love eventually\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah\n\nThe bittersweet between my teeth\n\nTrying to find the in-betweens\n\nFall back in love eventually\n\nYeah yeah yeah yeah",
