  "lyrics": "God gave me a stern intervention\r\nNow I'm on the verge of redemption\r\nBut it's hard to let the past go\r\nWhen the past is always the first thing mentioned\r\nWill the birds still chirp if the sun don't rise?\r\nWill the plants all die if the sun don't shine?\n\nHow can we see but we run 'round blind? I'm just askin'\n\nAnd I know in my heart of heart's that if rap don't work I'll be back to trappin'\n\nI pray that I fall while them rats are laughin'\n\nI've done seen violence, masters passion\n\nLet me tell you what we believe\n\nTold a lot of lies don't speak to me\n\nTime to tell the truth, I've increased the need\n\nI guess it's time to let go of the beast in me\n\nI'll be the first to admit, I built a motherfuckin' house of lies\n\nBut I burned it up and stood by that bitch with a gasoline can\n\nI doused the fire\n\nBut I still got burned, and tables still got turned\n\nI had to lick my wounds so know my scars are ones I've earned\n\n\n\nThey said the truth will set you free\n\nIt's what the preacher man said to me\n\nThey said the truth will set you free\n\nIt's what the preacher man said to me\n\n\n\n[Struggle Jennings:]\n\nMoney, sex, drugs what we like to idolize\n\nLivin' for the things that'll kill you, suicide\n\nHoldin' onto secrets in your life, eat you alive\n\nLive inside your truth, or you gonna die inside your lies\n\nMoney, sex, drugs what we like to idolize\n\nLivin' for the things that'll kill you, suicide\n\nHoldin' onto secrets in your life, eat you alive\n\nLive inside your truth, or you gonna die inside your lies\n\n\n\nThe brightest light that I see tonight\n\nStill shinin' bright from that burnin' bridge\n\nThat I made it off of, made it out\n\nBut I still doubt that I can stay away\n\nLove the flame that we set ablaze\n\nWe dance around it and we celebrate\n\n'Til someone die then it resonate\n\nAnd we point the fingers, wanna place the blame\n\nWe speculatin', incriminatin'\n\nLeave someone life behind a prison gate, I was filled with hate\n\nThere's no hunger like a starvin' artist, my kids relate\n\nI was stayin' broke, tryna pay my dues\n\nWhen it's said and done all the winners lose\n\nBeen a lonely path that us sinners choose\n\nSaid it's first or last, either win or lose\n\nLife's a garden, better throw your seeds\n\nGrow some trees, better kill the weeds\n\n'Fore they kill your garden\n\n'Cause the hardest part was lettin' go of all of my broken dreams\n\nGot plenty stains still on my soul\n\nLike the blood stains of my wardrobe\n\nMy horoscope said long journey\n\nBut a short road only Lord knows\n\n\n\nThey said the truth will set you free\n\nIt's what the preacher man said to me\n\nThey said the truth will set you free\n\nIt's what the preacher man said to me\n\n\n\nMoney, sex, drugs what we like to idolize\n\nLivin' for the things that'll kill you, suicide\n\nHoldin' onto secrets in your life, eat you alive\n\nLive inside your truth, or you gonna die inside your lies\n\nMoney, sex, drugs what we like to idolize\n\nLivin' for the things that'll kill you, suicide\n\nHoldin' onto secrets in your life, eat you alive\n\nLive inside your truth, or you gonna die inside your lies\n\n\n\nThey said the truth will set you free\n\nIt's what the preacher man said to me\n\nThey said the truth will set you free\n\nIt's what the preacher man said to me\n\n\n\nMoney, sex, drugs what we like to idolize\n\nLivin' for the things that'll kill you, suicide\n\nHoldin' onto secrets in your life, eat you alive\n\nLive inside your truth, or you gonna die inside your lies\n\nMoney, sex, drugs what we like to idolize\n\nLivin' for the things that'll kill you, suicide\n\nHoldin' onto secrets in your life, eat you alive\n\nLive inside your truth, or you gonna die inside your lies",
