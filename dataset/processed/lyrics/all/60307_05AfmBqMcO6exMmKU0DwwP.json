  "lyrics": "For all we know\rWe may never meet again\rBefore we go\rMake this moment live again\rWe won't say goodbye\rUntil the last minute\rI'll hold out my hand\rAnd my heart will be in it\rFor all we know\rThis might only be a dream\rWe come and we go\rLike the ripples, like the ripples in the stream\rSo baby, love me, love me tonight\rTomorrow was made for some\rOh, but tomorrow\rBut tomorrow may never, never come\rFor all we know\rYes, tomorrow may never, never come\rFor all we know",
