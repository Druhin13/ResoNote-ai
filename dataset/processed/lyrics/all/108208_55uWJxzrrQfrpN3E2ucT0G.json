  "lyrics": "Well he sits up there on his leatherette\r\nLooks through pictures of the ones that he hasn't had yet\r\nWhen he thinks he wants a closer look\r\nHe gets out his little black telephone book\r\n(He's calling, calling, calling)\r\n(He's calling, calling, calling)\n\n(He's calling, calling, calling)\n\n(He's calling)\n\n\n\nCome sit down here beside me honey\n\nLet's have a little heart to heart\n\nNow look at me and tell me darling\n\nHow badly do you want this part?\n\nAre you willing to sacrifice?\n\nAnd are you willing to be real nice?\n\nAll your talent and my good taste\n\nI'd hate to see it go to waste\n\n\n\nWe gonna get you an apartment, honey\n\nWe gonna get you a car\n\nYeah, we gonna take care of you darling\n\nWe gonna make you a movie star\n\nFor years I've seen 'em come and go\n\nHe says, \"I've had 'em all, you know\"\n\nI handled everything in my own way\n\nI made 'em what they are today\n\n\n\nAfter a while, nothing was pretty\n\nAfter a while, everything got lost\n\nStill his jacuzzi runneth over\n\nStill he just couldn't get off\n\nHe's just another power junky\n\nJust another silk-scarf monkey\n\nYou'd know it if you saw his stuff\n\nThe man just isn't big enough",
