  "lyrics": "You gave road head on a turnpike exit\r\nGoing home, going home\r\nLast ditch desperate, like a makeshift siphon\r\nPump and run, pump and run\r\nPump and run, pump and run\n\nRun!\n\n\n\n\"Dream on, baby,\" were his last words to me\n\n\"Dream on, baby\"\n\nSo dreaming baby took that corkscrewed highway\n\nLightless miles of big rigs\n\nLightless miles, miles and miles\n\n\n\nHome",
