  "lyrics": "Day breaks and when I turn\r\nYou're not on my pillow\r\nMy head shakes and then the penny drops\r\nStill your t-shirt on my chair\r\nPencilled hearts on paper\r\nI try not to think but I can't stop\n\nAnd doubt sets in like a storm\n\nI could feel it coming\n\nAnd words echo out yesterday\n\nTime pushed me to the edge\n\nThe jump was my decision\n\nI've only got myself to blame\n\n\n\n'Cause I have no right to love you\n\nWhen I chose to walk away\n\nI have no right to miss you\n\nWhen I didn't wanna stay\n\nAnd I have no right to need you\n\nWhen I knew what my heart was gonna lose\n\nI have no right to love you\n\nBut I do, I still do\n\nYeah, I still do\n\n\n\nNight falls, I'm wide awake\n\nWishing I could call you\n\nI'm too used to hearing all about your day\n\nThe cold creeps up next to me\n\nNow we don't share these covers\n\nBut I've no license to complain\n\n\n\n'Cause I have no right to love you\n\nWhen I chose to walk away\n\nI have no right to miss you\n\nWhen I didn't wanna stay\n\nAnd I have no right to need you\n\nWhen I knew what my heart was gonna lose\n\nI have no right to love you\n\nBut I do, I still do\n\n\n\nYou know I care, but I can't be there\n\nTo make this unmade bed of roses\n\nAnd you deserve to be put first\n\nI had to let you go\n\n\n\nI have no right to love you\n\nWhen I chose to walk away\n\nI have no right to miss you\n\nWhen I didn't wanna stay\n\nAnd I have no right to need you\n\nWhen I knew what my heart was gonna lose\n\nTo ask if you're okay\n\nWhen I left you so confused\n\nI have no right to love you\n\nI have no right, oh\n\nI have no right to love you\n\nBut I still do\n\nYeah, I still do, woah\n\nI still do",
