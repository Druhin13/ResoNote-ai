  "lyrics": "This ain't for the best\r\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\r\nYou must like me for me...\r\nWe can't make\r\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\r\nBut you can make me a drink\n\n\n\nDive bar on the east side, where you at?\n\nPhone lights up my nightstand in the black\n\nCome here, you can meet me in the back\n\nDark jeans and your Nikes, look at you\n\nOh damn, never seen that color blue\n\nJust think of the fun things we could do\n\n\n\n'Cause I like you\n\nThis ain't for the best\n\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\n\nYou must like me for me...\n\nYeah, I want you\n\nWe can't make\n\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\n\nBut you can make me a drink\n\n\n\nIs it cool that I said all that?\n\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\nIs it cool that I said all that\n\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nDelicate\n\n\n\nThird floor on the west side, me and you\n\nHandsome, your mansion with a view\n\nDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\n\nLong night, with your hands up in my hair\n\nEchoes of your footsteps on the stairs\n\nStay here, honey, I don't wanna share\n\n\n\n'Cause I like you\n\nThis ain't for the best\n\nMy reputation's never been worse, so\n\nYou must like me for me...\n\nYeah, I want you\n\nWe can't make\n\nAny promises now, can we, babe?\n\nBut you can make me a drink\n\n\n\nIs it cool that I said all that?\n\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\nIs it cool that I said all that\n\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nDelicate\n\n\n\nSometimes I wonder when you sleep\n\nAre you ever dreaming of me?\n\nSometimes when I look into your eyes\n\nI pretend you're mine, all the damn time\n\n'Cause I like you\n\n\n\nIs it cool that I said all that?\n\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\nYeah, I want you\n\nIs it cool that I said all that\n\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\n'Cause I like you\n\nIs it cool that I said all that?\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nIs it chill that you're in my head?\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nIs it cool that I said all that\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\nIs it too soon to do this yet?\n\nIsn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\n\n'Cause I know that it's delicate\n\nDelicate",
