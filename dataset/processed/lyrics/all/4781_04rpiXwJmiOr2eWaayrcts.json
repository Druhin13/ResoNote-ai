  "lyrics": "Remember when we were young\r\nWe were just kids with nowhere to run\r\nAll those nights at your house\r\nIt was 4 a.m. when you kicked me out\r\nOur friends say we're perfect, two souls intertwined\n\nA match made in heaven, just at the wrong time\n\nThe places we've been to, the times that we've shared\n\nShould've promise I'd always be there\n\n\n\nYou could have been the one\n\nBut now I see you with someone else\n\nI should've told you how\n\nI should have told you how I felt\n\n\n\nWe used to dance out in the rain\n\nI never wanted anything to change\n\nSo I read the letters that you wrote\n\nOver and over till the corners broke\n\n\n\nOur friends say we're perfect, two souls intertwined\n\nA match made in heaven, just at the wrong time\n\nThe places we've been to, the times that we've shared\n\nShould've promise I'd always be there\n\n\n\nYou could have been the one\n\nBut now I see you with someone else\n\nI should've told you how\n\nI should have told you how I felt\n\n\n\nYou could have been the one\n\nBut now I see you with someone else\n\nI guess you're happy now\n\nAnd I can only blame myself\n\n\n\nYou could have been the one\n\nBut now I see you with someone else\n\nI should've told you how\n\nI should have told you how I felt\n\n\n\nYou could have been the one\n\nBut now I see you with someone else\n\nI should've told you how\n\nI should have told you how I felt\n\n\n\nYou could have been the one\n\nBut now I see you with someone else\n\nI guess you're happy now\n\nAnd I can only blame myself",
