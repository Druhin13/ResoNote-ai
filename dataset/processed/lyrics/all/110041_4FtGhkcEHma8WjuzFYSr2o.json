  "lyrics": "Watching you sleep\r\nRun my hands through your hair and it’s got me thinking\r\nWhat you mean to me\r\nThere’s a chill in the air and a sinking feeling\r\nComing over me\r\nLike bitter tangerine\n\nLike sirens in the streets\n\nOh no\n\n\n\nMaybe our time has come\n\nMaybe we’re overgrown\n\nEven the sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long\n\nBaby, we're barely holding on\n\nEven the sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long\n\n\n\nJealous you can sleep\n\nYou’ve been keeping me up and I mouth the words\n\nI think I wanna speak\n\nInstead I’m wasting my time just pressing rewind\n\nTo all the nights we shared\n\nThe ripest peach or pear\n\nBut change is in the air, oh\n\n\n\nMaybe our time has come\n\nMaybe we’re overgrown\n\nEven the sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long\n\nBaby, we're barely holding on\n\nEven the sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long\n\n\n\nI was summer, you were spring\n\nYou can’t change what the seasons bring\n\nYeah, I was summer and you were spring\n\nYou can’t change what the seasons bring\n\n\n\nMaybe our time has come\n\nMaybe we’re overgrown\n\nEven the sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long\n\nBaby, we're barely holding on\n\nEven the sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long\n\n\n\nMaybe we're overgrown\n\nThe sweetest plum\n\nGot so long (got so long)\n\nThe sweetest plum\n\nHas only got so long",
