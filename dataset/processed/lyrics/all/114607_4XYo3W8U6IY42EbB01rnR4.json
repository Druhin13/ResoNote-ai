  "lyrics": "Alone, for the last time\r\nYou're just a loner\r\nGive it a try\r\nAnd you're hard on yourself\r\nAnd your laugh, it just melts in my hands\n\nLonesome in the streets\n\nYou say the mice all seem to laugh at me\n\n\n\nI'll get by with you on my mind\n\nI'll get by with you on my side\n\nI'll get by with you on my mind\n\nI'll get by with you on my side\n\n\n\nI'm not at home\n\nAnd I'll just say that\n\nBeing with you makes me feel less old\n\n\n\nA kid on the street playing basketball\n\nHorses will run forever, can't be called\n\n\n\nI don't know why\n\nI don't know why\n\nI don't know why\n\nWish that I, wish that I\n\nWish that I could go back in time\n\n\n\nI'll get by with you on my mind (on my mind)\n\nI'll get by with you on my side (on my side)\n\nI'll get by with you on my mind (on my mind)\n\nI'll get by with you on my side",
