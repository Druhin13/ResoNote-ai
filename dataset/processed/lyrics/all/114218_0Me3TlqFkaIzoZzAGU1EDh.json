(*Gunshots*)\n\n6ix come on get up!\n\nI'm shot, I'm shot, what, I'm shot! (*Gunshots*)\n\nGet the fuck on the ground!\n\nAww fuck\n\nThey got me\n\n(*IV beep*)\n\n\n\nHe's bleeding slow, blood dripping from his torso\n\nWill he ever get to see his son grow?\n\nWhat's the picture they gon' paint after he go?\n\nLast song he ever sung when the bullet hit his lung\n\nMan I should've never called, he'd be alive if he ain't come\n\nAll he tried to do was help save my wife\n\nWish I could've saved his life\n\nI wish I can take it back\n\nNow my best friend's life curtain call fade to black\n\nIt just ain't no turning back\n\nPulled out the gat and put a bullet through the man\n\nThe blew in and came out his back\n\nJump in the whip, no looking back\n\nFirst time in the front seat of that white and black\n\nSide streets through the city, ain't nobody fucking with me\n\nYeah you know I had to duck 'em all\n\nScreaming \"Motherfuck the law\"\n\nNext thing I saw was a block from my crib\n\nThink about my shorty, she my rib\n\nPull up in the driveway\n\nNo cops in sight but might just somehow pull 'em my way\n\nOpen the stash, get the cash\n\nNow I'm back out so I put the Audi in reverse and then I back out\n\nLook at the addy in the text with my girl whereabouts\n\nFive minutes later now I'm creeping in a warehouse\n\nLot of goons, lot of guns\n\nNow I'm shooting just for fun\n\nI don't give a fuck where they come from, I'm killing everyone\n\nFinally make it to the back all alone pitch black\n\nHear a sound, what was that?\n\nThink it came from over there\n\nLights on, now I see my wife she's tied up to a chair\n\nWith a gun to her head and a man gripping her hair\n\nAll I did was stop and stare\n\nHe took the gag out of her mouth and she started calling my name (Bobby!)\n\nBut didn't seem to be in pain, really shaken up (Bobby!)\n\nI felt like I was waking up\n\nSo I shot him quick in the neck and he hit the floor\n\nBefore I untied her I shot him four more times\n\nPut a bullet in his spine\n\nWas he dead? let's see\n\nStaring at the man, gun in his hand, it couldn't be\n\nThe man who kidnapped my wife was me\n\n\n\nBobby!\n\nWhat?\n\nMan get your ass up nigga, we at the studio\n\nSay what?\n\nDamn man. C'mon, hurry up man. What's wrong with you?\n\nWake up, here. Come on\n\nWait, we're at the studio right now? We're here already?\n\nDamn man since you started smoking weed you always fucking late\n\nMan shut the fuck up Kev\n\nStoney Bob neck ass",
