  "lyrics": "(Christine McVie)\r\nSo cool, calm and collected\r\nYou had a style, a rakish style\r\nWell my poor heart never connected\r\nYou'd stay so long on my mind.\n\nWell, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world\n\nDo you remember it\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nLooking back so long ago\n\nYou had a knack, a knack of making women know\n\nOoh there wasn't the time\n\nAnd I knew you'd nver be mine\n\nWell, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world\n\nDo you remember\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nIsn't it midnight on the other side of the world\n\nDo you remember\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nThe face of a pretty girl\n\nThe face of a pretty girl",
