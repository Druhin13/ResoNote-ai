  "lyrics": "Let's face the truth\r\nSooner or later, no matter what somebody has to lose\r\nI'll be on the road and you're going to school in Baton Rouge\r\nAnd I promise you the world might love, but what's this?\r\nBut what's this?\r\nI can't explain how it feels like we have it all\n\nWhen everything's bound to change\n\nI'm fearing that I lose my place inside of your picture frames\n\nAnd I promise you the world might love, but we can't stay\n\n\n\nTonight, we're saying goodbye, chain-smoking cigarettes\n\nWe lie, pretend it's alright\n\nI say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next\n\nWe'll find some way to get by one day at a time\n\n\n\nI know it's hard\n\nI'm dreading the moment I see you pack all that shit in your car\n\nWhen one of us walks out the door all alone with a broken heart\n\nSo let's make the most of this moment before it all falls apart\n\n\n\nWhatever's meant to be, just hold your head up\n\nNo matter where we go, I'm on your side\n\nLet's not make it out like we are fed up\n\nThere's just no controlling when it's time\n\n\n\nTonight, we're saying goodbye, chain-smoking cigarettes\n\nWe lie, pretend it's alright\n\nI say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next\n\nWe'll find some way to get by one day at a time\n\n\n\nBaby, baby, leave for the road\n\nYou don't need my permission to go on your own\n\nSo don't act crazy and turn around when you realize\n\nThe future's hazy, just keep that piece of shit in drive\n\n\n\nTonight, we're saying goodbye, chain-smoking cigarettes\n\nWe lie, pretend it's alright\n\nI say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next\n\nWe'll find some way to get by one day at a time\n\nTonight, we're saying goodbye, chain-smoking cigarettes\n\nWe lie, pretend it's alright\n\nI say you'll always be mine, don't know what happens next\n\nWe'll find some way to get by one day at a time",
