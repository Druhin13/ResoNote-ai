  "lyrics": "I'm gonna get out\r\nIf it's the last thing that I do\r\nAnd in my heart\r\nMy 15 minutes are burned through\r\nI won't come back to fall off track\r\nThe way that I survived\n\nIt's a violent world\n\nBut today I'm still alive\n\n\n\nI need you to tell me everything will be alright\n\nTo chase away the voices in the night\n\nWhen they call my name\n\nHave I gone insane?\n\n\n\nWoah oh! Woah oh oh oh!\n\nWoah oh! Woah oh oh oh!\n\n\n\nThese thoughts'll kill me\n\nAnd everything that I hold true\n\nAnd as I grow\n\nI let my fear replace my youth\n\nI won't turn back, I won't cross that\n\nHidden danger line\n\nIt's a loud and dark world\n\nBut I think I've found the light\n\n\n\nI need you to tell me everything will be alright\n\nTo chase away the voices in the night\n\nWhen they call my name\n\nHave I gone insane?\n\n\n\nI need you to tell me everything will be alright\n\nTo chase away the voices in the night\n\nWhen they call my name\n\nHave I gone insane?\n\n\n\nI need you to tell me everything will be alright\n\nTo chase away the voices in the night\n\nWhen they call my name\n\nHave I gone insane?\n\n\n\nWoah oh! Woah oh oh oh!\n\nWoah oh! Woah oh oh oh!\n\nWoah oh! Woah oh oh oh!\n\nWoah oh! Woah oh oh oh!",
