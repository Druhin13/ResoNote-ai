  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Get Innocuous! par LCD Soundsystem\r\nHome - home in the late-night\nAnd away - away in the half-life\nExcept saturday - crushed by the boring\nUntil played and plagued by the tourists again\n\nWhen once you had believed it\nNow you see it's sucking you in\n\nTo string you along with the pretense\nAnd pave the way for the coming release\n\nAlone and prone in the half-light\nAnd late- late to the real-life\nIf you will find a way into the gold rush\nYou will stay until the morning comes\nYou can normalize\n\nDon't it make you feel alive",
