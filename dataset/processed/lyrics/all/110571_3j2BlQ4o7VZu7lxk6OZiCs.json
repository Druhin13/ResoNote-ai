  "lyrics": "I can't go fast enough\r\nTo break free from the bond of your love\r\nAnd I ain't been strong enough\r\nTo let go and let gone\r\nI can't see clear enough\r\nTo look past the dust you left behind\n\nAnd I can't get high enough\n\nTo forget why I cry (I cry, I cry)\n\n\n\nSo I'll drive\n\nTen thousand miles into the dead of night\n\nTill I run out of love for you, baby\n\nTill I've got no more love for you, baby\n\nOh, I'll drive\n\nTen thousand miles into the endless sky\n\nTill I run out of love for you, baby\n\nTill I've got no more love for you, baby\n\n\n\nI will drive all night\n\nI will drive all night\n\nLeave it all behind\n\nI will drive all night\n\n\n\nI paint a silhouette (I paint a silhouette)\n\nIn the shadow of every headlight\n\nI turn up my radio (I turn up my radio)\n\nBut I can't turn off my mind\n\nSomehow you get to me (somehow you get to me)\n\nIt don't matter the distance I go\n\nAll love is dead to me (dead to me)\n\nBut I believe in ghosts\n\n\n\nSo I'll drive\n\nTen thousand miles into the dead of night\n\nTill I run out of love for you, baby\n\nTill I've got no more love for you, baby\n\n\n\nI will drive all night, I will drive all night\n\nLeave it all behind, I will drive all night\n\nI will drive all night, I will drive all night\n\nLeave it all behind, I will drive all night\n\nI will drive all night",
