  "lyrics": "In a poor attempt to taper swine\r\nThe suits prohibit wine\r\nWind up with a fiery now\r\nThe soother prophet preaches doom\r\nLike this is Zeus's room\r\nWhen mixes had to be broken down\n\n\n\nSettle down\n\nSettle down\n\n\n\nA mindless savage breaks the mold\n\nIgnores the fears of old\n\nWields fire to appease the unknown\n\nThe fire turns to mushroom clouds\n\nWho's got the power now?\n\nA savage with a mobile phone\n\n\n\nWho's cursing them now?\n\nWho's cursing them now?\n\n\n\nIn addition to your atom scent\n\nWhere [?] soul is spent\n\nLeaning on a rotary view\n\nThe ego sniffs the basic script\n\nEach line like feelings lit\n\nBarricading all that is true\n\n\n\nWho's cursin' us now?\n\nWho's cursin' us now?\n\n\n\nThe ravaged banker licks the sun\n\nSpends Pluto on his tongue\n\nBut holds out with some mercy for me\n\nI spent my last un-seamless dreams\n\nMet my maker by the sea\n\nWho said, \"A dream is just a choice you can see\"\n\nAnd if the movers [?] this\n\nWhat did the beggar miss\n\nWrapped up in his terminal sneeze?\n\n\n\nWho's cursin' me now?\n\nWho's cursin' me now?\n\nWho's cursin' me now?\n\nWho's cursin' me now?\n\n\n\nJust call to me if you who's cursed me now",
