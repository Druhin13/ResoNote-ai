  "lyrics": "You crossed my mind when I crossed state lines\r\nI know I really should have called you\r\nBetween the city signs on the all night drives back home\r\nI really should have called you but I just didn't want to\r\nYou've got me wrapped around your finger\n\nLike a noose tied around my neck, so what's next?\n\n'Cause I might be falling but I'm not down yet\n\n\n\nI swear I saw your name in letters on a license plate last night\n\nI must be losing my mind\n\nEvery song I've heard this week was written about you and me I think\n\nI really should have called you, I just couldn't bring myself to\n\n\n\nYou've got me wrapped around your finger\n\nLike a noose tied around my neck, so what's next?\n\nYou're keeping me awake in a hotel bed\n\nYou got me wrapped around your finger, so what's next?\n\n'Cause I might be falling but I'm not down yet\n\n\n\nSo let's try to be honest I don't know what I want\n\n'Cause it's too much to handle and I just get caught up\n\nTripping over every word I would say to you\n\nIf you let me cause you got me",
