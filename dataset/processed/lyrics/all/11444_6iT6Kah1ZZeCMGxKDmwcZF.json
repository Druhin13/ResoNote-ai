  "lyrics": "Just gotta be me\r\nSo many voices\r\nPJ, you're not mainstream enough, yeah\r\nWould you consider us changing some stone?\r\nLike everything about who you are, ah\n\nNo offense, we're just trying to make you a star\n\n\n\nBut I must admit, I'm claustrophobic\n\nI have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind\n\nAnd I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything\n\nI can see right in front of me\n\n\n\nPJ, you're not quite street enough\n\nThug life my nigga\n\nActor, little more time\n\nOh, can you switch your star up a little more?\n\nYou can be yourself, lay down for now\n\nAnd need the religion\n\n\n\nBut I must admit, I'm claustrophobic\n\nI have a hard time trying to fit into your small mind\n\nAnd I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything\n\nI can see right in front of me\n\n\n\nCan't see, the forest for the trees\n\nThe movement for the breeze\n\nStanding on my own feet\n\nCan't see, what you might want from me\n\nThink it's better if we be ourselves\n\n\n\nThey clatch into my talents more than Catholics do arousery\n\nSteady ass, wear that accent, travel you from New Orleans\n\nGo so, why I dabble with negative energy\n\nWhen all I really fiend is impossi sensibility\n\nNot the hardest rapper but I'm 'bout it much as Master P\n\nDon't play with me, five-0 for my home\n\nDon't you know that\n\nFlooding through the streets\n\nYou should probably take a kodak\n\nCodo synthesize probably right in front eyes\n\nMade a trip to Cali and came back a different guy\n\nLiving through the same eyes, riding Uber, still got drived\n\nThe truest never lie and I need a little space\n\n'Cause I'm bad at doing me\n\nJust reside if you are late\n\n\n\nI'm claustrophobic\n\nI have a hard time to fit into your small mind\n\nAnd I have a habit of dreaming bigger than anything\n\nI can see right in front of me\n\n\n\nAnother man, just gotta be you\n\nI think that the thing makes us unique\n\nIt's our differences with our treasures\n\nSomebody always tryna make you fit in a box\n\nAnd never seen again, don't think it's possible",
