  "lyrics": "Why does a dog need to be walked?\r\nThree birds fighting out in the yard\r\nBut I don’t know what they’re fighting about\r\nSo why does a dog need to listen\r\nWhenever you shout?\n\nThese cats seem to blow\n\nEveryone’s mind, but mine\n\nWhat is so funny\n\nAbout beasts above understanding?\n\n\n\nAre you their master?\n\nDid you buy them at the store?\n\nDid they know they were a cure\n\nFor you to stop being bored?\n\nSo somebody mated them\n\nAnd took their babies away from them\n\nStuck a price tag on their nose\n\nAnd now you’re buying it clothes\n\n\n\nSo, why does a dog need to be walked?",
