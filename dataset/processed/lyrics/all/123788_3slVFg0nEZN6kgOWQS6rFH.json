  "lyrics": "You're killing me, baby, with the things you do\r\nPut me in the ground before we're through\r\nBurning up this town\r\nSpending everything I've saved, yeah\r\nYou've been out all night\r\nDiggin' my grave\n\n\n\nEvery little lie you're talking\n\nKeep it hid\n\nYou're just another nail on my cover your lid\n\nSomeone else is getting all the love you never gave, yeah\n\nYou've been out all night\n\nDiggin' my grave\n\n\n\nSo keep go runnin' 'round\n\nAin't no need to hurry back\n\n'Cause I'll be gone from here\n\nYou'll be all dressed up in black\n\nSix feet under, babe, that's where I'll be\n\nBy the time that you're done with me\n\nAll these tears I cry drowning in a tidal wave\n\nYou've been up all night\n\nDiggin' my grave\n\n\n\nSo keep go runnin' 'round\n\nAin't no need to hurry back\n\n'Cause I'll be gone from here\n\nYou'll be all dressed up in black\n\nSix feet under, babe, that's where I'll be\n\nBy the time that you're done with me\n\nAll these tears I cry drowning in a tidal wave\n\nYou've been up all night\n\nDiggin' my grave\n\nYou've been up all night\n\nDiggin' my grave\n\n\n\nDiggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my\n\nDiggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my grave\n\nDiggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my\n\nDiggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my, diggin' my grave",
