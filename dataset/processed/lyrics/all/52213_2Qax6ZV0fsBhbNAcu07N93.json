  "lyrics": "You can never see me shine like I always wanted you to\r\nThere's something in the way, or you miss it againâ€”and again\r\nStill shimmer holding out, always beaming over to you\r\nSo very far away, I hope it gets there still\r\nLike the summer always fades and the wind gets cool on your skin\n\nYou know that something was, will never be again\n\nWe glimmer in the dark of a life we haven't known\n\nSometimes another one can let you know that you're there\n\n\n\nAlways keep your eyes on the pulsar\n\nGuiding you home from wherever you are\n\nWe're on our way home from another star\n\nIt's been so long and we've come so far\n\nWe've come so far",
