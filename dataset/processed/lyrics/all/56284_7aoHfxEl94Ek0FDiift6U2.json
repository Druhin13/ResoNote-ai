  "lyrics": "Hours and days rolling back like seconds\r\nI'm still grinding my teeth down on the truth\r\nI fell for you in so many ways, I need to breathe in\r\nBut, when I'm with you, I can't help the truth\r\nYou got your friends and you built your whole life here\n\nI'm from a small place, somewhere unfamiliar\n\nYou're not alone, you got somebody waiting\n\nBut wait a second, I got so much more to give\n\n\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nIt could be, it could be a waste of time\n\nBut it's gonna be, gonna be worth the fight\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n\n\nWhy can't I sleep, and I'm busy and I'm restless\n\nUntil it's slow motion on a fast train ride home with you?\n\nIs it hard for you like it is for me? I'm going crazy\n\nAnd, some days, I can't deal with the truth\n\n\n\nIt's delicate and it never feels easy\n\nBut look me in the eye and tell me you're happy\n\nI know she benefits, she's known you longer\n\nBut wait up, wait up, I got so much more to give\n\n\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nIt could be, it could be a waste of time\n\nBut it's gonna be, gonna be worth the fight\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n\n\nLong-last, curb swinging\n\nBlue light, slow evening\n\nFreefall, hushed screaming\n\nWait up, wait up, I got so much more to give\n\n\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nIt could be, it could be a waste of time\n\nBut it's gonna be, gonna be worth the fight\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\n\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)\n\nIt could be, it could be\n\nIt's gonna be, gonna be\n\nNo-one's gonna be there for you like I am\n\n(I am, I am)",
