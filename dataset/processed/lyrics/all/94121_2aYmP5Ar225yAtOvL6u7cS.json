  "lyrics": "I lost all my lunch, I threw it on the ground\r\nI don't wanna talk, don't wanna be around\r\nI know you're trying to help, I think that's really nice\r\nBut I know myself, I don't need your advice\r\nI've got a hint for you, take it\n\nAre you hungry? I have my shorts for you to eat\n\nLeave me alone, I don't owe you anything\n\nYou're not my friend, you're not my mom\n\nSo please don't talk to me, you don't know anything\n\nI am not your conversation\n\nPeople will talk but that's not what I want\n\nI can be myself without explanation\n\n\n\nAlone on Sunday night, I saw a ton of shit\n\nIt made me really mad, you told me not to quit\n\nSaid \"This is how it is, you're giving them your life\"\n\nBut I don't wanna give, I want it for myself\n\nAs selfish as it is, I need it for my health\n\nAnd I have stuff to do, for me nobody else, nobody else\n\n\n\nSo please don't talk to me, you don't know anything\n\nI am not your conversation\n\nPeople will talk but that's not what I want\n\nI can be myself without explanation",
