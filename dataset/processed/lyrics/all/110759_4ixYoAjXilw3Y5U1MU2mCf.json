  "lyrics": "Some days I can't say why I'm feeling lonely\r\nSome days I am too proud to ask for help\r\nAnd I stumble through the noise\r\nTrying to find some peace\r\nA stranger in the crowd, I lose myself\n\nSo, I walk down to the river\n\nWhere the troubles, they can't find me\n\nLet the waters there remind me\n\nThe sun will be there when we wake\n\n\n\nI walk down to the river\n\nThough I might not understand it\n\nIt's not always as we planned it\n\nBut we grow stronger when we break\n\nSo, I walk down to the river\n\nI walk down to the river\n\n\n\nThis raging world can get so overwhelming\n\nLooking for a meaning when it won't make sense\n\nIn my head its getting loud\n\nLike i can't outrun this cloud\n\nNo matter where i go well there i am\n\n\n\nSo, I walk down to the river\n\nWhere the troubles, they can't find me\n\nLet the waters there remind me\n\nThe sun will be there when we wake\n\n\n\nI walk down to the river\n\nThough I might not understand it\n\nIt's not always as we planned it\n\nBut we grow stronger when we break\n\nSo, I walk down to the river\n\nI walk down to the river\n\n\n\nLet the calm pull me under\n\nFar beyond the thunder\n\nTell me it will all be ok\n\nLet the waves take all my worries\n\nConquer them with fury\n\nGive me shelter be my escape\n\n\n\nI walk down to the river\n\nWhere the troubles, they can't find me\n\nLet the waters there remind me\n\nThe sun will be there when we wake\n\n\n\nI walk down to the river\n\nThough I might not understand it\n\nIt's not always as we planned it\n\nBut we grow stronger when we break\n\nSo, I walk down to the river\n\nI walk down to the river \n\nI walk down to the river\n\nI walk down to the river\n\nI walk down to the river\n\nTo the river \n\nTo the river\n\nI walk down oh, oh, oh\n\nTo the river oh, oh, oh",
