  "lyrics": "Sun is hanging low across the street\r\nAs we're fighting, loving, talking in the heat\r\nWe are walking home barely\r\nEveryday we'll meet, everyday we'll meet, do the same\r\nI can sing you a song, take you home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my own\n\nI can sing you a song, take you home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\n\n\nWe could dance all night, sleep all day\n\nKiss and love and just walk away\n\nTo try another rules and disobey\n\nMove so slow we didn't see a change\n\n\n\nI can sing you a song, take you home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my own\n\nI can sing you a song, take you home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\n\n\nI can sing you a song, take you home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my own\n\nI can sing you a song, take you home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\n\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home\n\nBut I can't seem to find my way home",
