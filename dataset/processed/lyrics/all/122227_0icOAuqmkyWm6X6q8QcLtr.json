  "lyrics": "Friday night at home, it's kinda getting old\r\nNothing really gets me, I'll prolly do this next week\r\nPack another bowl, watch an episode\r\nSeen it all before, yeah\r\nI'm kinda gettin' bored, yeah\n\nMaybe I should switch it up a little bit\n\nGo spend all my money for the hell of it\n\nCall up all my homies say \"let's roll with it\"\n\nWhy not just dive in the deep end\n\nDo a deep dive in the DMs\n\n\n\nNo plans, grab some girls and bring 'em down to San Fran\n\nWe just wanna party and bull shit\n\nStay up to the mornin' we got no plans, no plans, no plans\n\nNo plans, grab some girls and bring 'em down to San Fran\n\nWe just wanna party and bull shit\n\nStay up to the mornin' we got no plans, no plans, no plans\n\n\n\nWe were skinny dipping in the ocean, ocean\n\nTook off all our clothes and someone stole 'em, oh shit\n\nRight now I don't even care, ain't a big deal\n\nWe ain't got nowhere to be\n\nThat shit is funny to me\n\nLong as we young and we free\n\n\n\nMaybe I should switch it up a little bit\n\nGo spend all my money for the hell of it\n\nCall up all my homies say \"let's roll with it\"\n\nWhy not just dive in the deep end\n\nDo a deep dive in the DMs\n\n\n\nNo plans, grab some girls and bring 'em down to San Fran\n\nWe just wanna party and bull shit\n\nStay up to the mornin' we got no plans, no plans, no plans\n\n\n\nI ain't got no plans\n\nYou don't need to know in advance\n\nI got some time today\n\nBut I ain't got time to waste\n\nNo, got the top off by the ocean\n\nI'm takin' my shot now I'm focused\n\nNow it's case closed and she open\n\nJust left San Fran on the way to Oakland\n\n\n\nNo plans, grab some girls and bring 'em down to San Fran\n\nWe just wanna party and bull shit\n\nStay up to the mornin' we got no plans, no plans, no plans\n\n\n\nNo plans, no plans, no plans\n\nNo plans, no plans, no plans\n\nNo plans, no plans, no plans\n\nNo plans, no plans, no plans",
