  "lyrics": "I don't mind the pain, or the jokers' cold refrain\r\nThe days pass by so slowly, I count them all again\r\nSilence of a basement, shades all closed at noon\r\nLie awake for fear of strangers\r\nDarkness comes on slowly, twilight is the ecstasy\n\nLike a candle burning bright, shadows dance until the night\n\nEmpty rooms and chilling smiles\n\nThey go on for miles and miles\n\n\n\nChorus: But in the evening when the sun goes down\n\nCrawl from the shadows got to get into town\n\nWhere the music is playin' all across the night\n\nAnd every cloud disappears from sight\n\n\n\nThere goes a loser, another loser gone\n\nThere goes another, another who's alone\n\nThere goes a loser, another loser gone wild\n\n\n\nI don't mind if violins don't play\n\nI won't listen to them anyway\n\nI don't care what people say\n\nSome things just can't be arranged\n\nIcy fingers touching you.\n\nSilent voices calling too\n\nWhat else is there to lose- I am here but where are you?\n\n\n\nChorus",
