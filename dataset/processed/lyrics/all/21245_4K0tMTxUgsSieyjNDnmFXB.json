  "lyrics": "Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it\r\nJust a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish\r\nJust a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger\r\nNo shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner\r\nNothing ever comes like it did when you were in it\n\nKeeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer\n\nNow you're passing your people like a ship in the night\n\nLooking to every stranger for a fight\n\n\n\nNothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it\n\nChoking like a dog, like a dog on a collar\n\nOpen up your mouth, your mouth if you want it\n\nListen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down\n\n\n\nHoping that you like, that you like how you're living\n\nRelying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven\n\nHow many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?\n\nHow many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?\n\n\n\nNothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it\n\nChoking like a dog, like a dog on a collar\n\nOpen up your mouth, your mouth if you want it\n\nListen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down\n\n\n\nNothing ever comes, ever comes\n\nChoking like a dog, like a dog\n\nOpen up your mouth\n\nListen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down\n\n\n\nNothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it\n\nChoking like a dog, like a dog on a collar\n\nOpen up your mouth if you want it\n\nListen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down",
