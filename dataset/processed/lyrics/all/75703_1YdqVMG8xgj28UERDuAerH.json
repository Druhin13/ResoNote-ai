  "lyrics": "Love is strong won't let you go\rHunts you down it wants you so.\rLost in love a fool can't see\rBroken heart are meant to be\rYou can't run from love\rYou can't run.\rTears its way into your heart,\rLeaves and you fall apart\rPain is all it has to give\rAll I want is to hold\rTears of pain, once tears of joy\rEmptiness and a boy destroyed\rA heart lies lost and slightly soiled\rAnd still I cry to hold you\rYou can't run from love\rYou can't run.",
