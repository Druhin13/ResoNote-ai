  "lyrics": "I been burning Bright\r\nFor so long I can't remember\r\nPretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work\r\nBelieve me when I say, I can't stay this high forever\r\nThis man's had all he can stand, time to lay this body down\n\nSweet Annie\n\nCan I stay with you a while\n\nCause this roads been putting miles on my heart,\n\nSweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy\n\nBut one day Lightning will strike\n\nAnd my bark will lose it's bite\n\nDon't' give up on me\n\nSweet Annie.\n\n\n\nSweet Annie\n\nI know I promised you a life\n\nBut an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight\n\nIf I could take back yesterday, Find a way to start it over\n\nTurn around, put that bottle down and pray it's not too late\n\n\n\nSweet Annie\n\nCan I stay with you a while\n\nCause this roads been putting miles on my heart,\n\nSweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy\n\nBut one day Lightning will strike\n\nAnd my bark will lose it's bite\n\nDon't' give up on me\n\nWhat will be will be\n\n\n\nSweet Annie.\n\n\n\nTurn out the light\n\nThese hands alone to hold you\n\nFall all over you\n\nAll over again\n\nCome a little closer so I can show you\n\nMy heart still beats fast for you\n\nAll over, and over again\n\n\n\nSweet Annie\n\nCan I stay with you a while\n\nCause this roads been putting miles on my heart,\n\nSweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy\n\nBut one day Lightning will strike\n\nAnd my bark will lose it's bite\n\nDon't' give up on me\n\n\n\nSweet Annie.",
