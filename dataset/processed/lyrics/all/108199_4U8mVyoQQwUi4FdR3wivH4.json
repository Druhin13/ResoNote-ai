  "lyrics": "Oh my don't the sky look spacious\r\nWith the stars all shinin' down\r\nWell I can hear the night wind howlin'\r\nIt's a high and lonesome sound\r\nAnd I ain't had a woman in so long \n\nI can't feed my starvin' soul\n\nCome on saddle up boys\n\nWe're gonna ride in to town\n\nWe're gonna get a little out of control\n\n\n\nThere's a card game in the corner\n\nAnd the barmaid smiled at me\n\nWell I tipped her a silver dollar\n\nAnd she brought me a drink for free\n\n\n\nAll the town folk call her the cheap one\n\nAnd the gamblers call her Flo\n\nCome on set 'em up again\n\nI got me a friend\n\nAnd I think I'm gettin' out of control\n\n\n\nShe's cool water Her momma taught her\n\nI got news she's mine and mine alone\n\n\n\nAnd if anybody's lookin' for trouble\n\nYou know I'm the one you want to try\n\nWell I'll fight any man who wants to\n\nAnd I don't care who or why\n\n\n\nYou got to gamble on your story\n\nYou got no guts you get no glory\n\nAnd I'm bettin' my money on an ace in the hole\n\nThink I'm getting' out of control.",
