  "lyrics": "You were talking trash, we were tossing bags\r\nWhen I caught your name at a cornhole game\r\nSeptember Saturday in Rocky Top\r\nUp on top of G10 parking lot\r\nSaid, \"Girl, where you sitting\r\nI got an extra ticket\n\nIt's right on the 50\"\n\n\n\nYou had a 16 home team jersey on\n\nSinging every word to the fight song\n\nHad your airplane bottles from your purse out\n\nHad a country mile smile every first down\n\nLast thing on my mind was the football\n\nWatching you girl like it's gonna be a good fall\n\nYou'd have thought that post-game kiss\n\nWoulda made me wanna make you mine\n\nBut you had me by halftime\n\n\n\nThey sent out the pride of a south land band\n\nAnd all I could think about was holding your hand\n\nWas just gonna catch it on a couch TV\n\nAnd last second scored a couple ticket for free\n\nBut baby I'd have bid anything to see that\n\n\n\n16 home team jersey on\n\nSinging every word to the fight song\n\nHad your airplane bottles from your purse out\n\nHad a country mile smile every first down\n\nLast thing on my mind was the football\n\nWatching you girl like it's gonna be a good fall\n\nYou'd thought that post-game kiss\n\nWoulda made me wanna make you mine\n\nBut you had me by halftime\n\n\n\nNow every time the leaves start falling down\n\nI bet you're thinking bout\n\n\n\n16 home team jersey on\n\nSinging every word to the fight song\n\nHad your airplane bottles from your purse out\n\nHad a country mile smile every first down\n\nLast thing on my mind was the football\n\nWatching you girl like it's gonna be a good fall\n\nYou'd thought that post-game kiss\n\nWoulda made me wanna make you mine\n\nBut you had me by halftime",
