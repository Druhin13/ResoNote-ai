  "lyrics": "Wakin' up late back in our youth\r\nA picture in my pocket of a rose tattoo\r\nStood in the cold 'til our lips turned blue\r\nEvery little thought I thought was you\r\nDo you ever think about way back when?\r\nNever gettin' worried about where we've been\n\nAll over Knoxville livin' in sin\n\nWhen every little heart string played pretend\n\n\n\nOh, I didn't mean to let you go\n\nMove to fast, when we're fallin' slow\n\nI didn't mean to let you go\n\n\n\nHow many times do you have to lose\n\nHow many times 'til it gets to you\n\nI close my eyes all I see is you\n\nHow many times can a heart get bruised\n\nIt's an end to you, just empty space that I never use\n\nHow many faces will I lie next to\n\nHow many times 'til I get to you\n\n\n\nIf we give again and press restart\n\nDrinkin' it straight in a burnt out car\n\nWonderin' if there's life on Mars\n\nNow I'm only wonderin' where you are\n\nFeels like runnin' down a one way street\n\nWhere all those faces meant nothin' to me\n\nAll the stars that were left unseen\n\nNow you're somewhere else not next to me\n\n\n\nOh, I didn't mean to let you go\n\n\n\nHow many times do you have to lose\n\nHow many times 'til it gets to you\n\nI close my eyes all I see is you\n\nHow many times can a heart get bruised\n\nIt's an end to you, just empty space that I never use\n\nHow many faces will I lie next to\n\nHow many times 'til I get to you\n\n\n\nOh, I didn't mean to let you go\n\nMove to fast, when we're fallin' slow\n\nI didn't mean to let you go\n\n\n\nHow many times do you have to lose\n\nHow many times 'til it gets to you\n\nI close my eyes all I see is you\n\nHow many times can a heart get bruised\n\nIt's an end to you, just empty space that I never use\n\nHow many faces will I lie next to\n\nHow many times 'til I get to you\n\n\n\nOh, oh\n\nIt's an end to you, just empty space that I never use\n\nHow many faces will I lie next to\n\nHow many times 'til I get to you",
