  "lyrics": "Most when it's almost like a bane\r\nYou arrive like a siren refrain\r\nLike death, she takes everything\r\nAnd dazes me like patent medicine\r\nInto this strange divine\r\nThe road was serpentine\n\nA network of silken threads\n\nSpider's trapping web\n\nMakes me rue the day\n\n\n\nYou became my pain killer\n\nI rue the day\n\nAlright, alright, alright\n\n\n\nPraying at the altar of your legs and feet\n\nYour saliva is a drug so bittersweet\n\nI'll arrogate what's there to take\n\nIn an evanescent embrace\n\nAnesthetic liaison\n\nHoney honey youâ€™re my medication\n\nLike love, you take everything\n\nAnd this static yearn\n\nMakes me rue the day\n\n\n\nYou became my pain killer\n\nI rue the day\n\nAlright, alright, alright\n\n\n\nStrange divine\n\nStrange divine\n\nStrange divine\n\n\n\nI rue the day\n\nYou became my pain killer\n\nI rue the day\n\nAlright, alright, alright\n\nI rue the day\n\nYou became my pain killer\n\nI rue the day\n\nAlright, Alright, Alright\n\nYou became my pain killer\n\nYou became my pain killer",
