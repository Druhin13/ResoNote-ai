  "lyrics": "The last of our martyrs seeks no adoration\r\nFrom his castle in the air of eternal vibration\r\nWe won't lose sight of the lasting words he wrote\r\nWe won't lose sight of what matters most\r\nA shining beacon of wisdom\n\nArmed to the teeth\n\nFearless conviction\n\nNow that he's gone we're going to miss him\n\n\n\nImmortalised between the lines\n\nConceived by a human heart inside\n\n\n\nHe once said to us, my friend hope is a prison\n\nBut the hope his chords sung only spread love\n\nIn a hollow crowned kingdom\n\n\n\nThere are no fighters left here anymore\n\nSee you on the other side\n\nOf that open door\n\n\n\nWe won't lose sight\n\nWe won't lose sight\n\nOf the lasting words he wrote\n\nWe won't lose sight of what matters most",
