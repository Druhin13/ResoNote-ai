  "lyrics": "Late night, drivin', thinkin', where are we going?\r\nDon't doubt, don't ask\r\nGo fast, headed straight for the past\r\nMy house, my room, too soon, what are we doing?\r\nWhy does this feel so good?\n\nDim the light, close your eyes\n\nHere again to test the water\n\nAlways fight what we find\n\nBut we search a little longer\n\n\n\nThere's no truth we're second guessing\n\nThere's not use in not confessing\n\nNever right, but tonight\n\nThink we might be getting warmer\n\n\n\n(Get on, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get off, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get on, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get off, we can keep it on the low)\n\n\n\nHeartbeat's racin', tracin' what it's been craving\n\nI can't help but want it, don't know how to admit\n\nNo right time or place to open my mouth and say\n\nWhy does this feel so good?\n\n\n\nDim the light, close your eyes\n\nHere again to test the water\n\nAlways fight what we find\n\nBut we search a little longer\n\n\n\nThere's no truth we're second guessing\n\nThere's not use in not confessing\n\nNever right, but tonight\n\nThink we might be getting warmer\n\n\n\n(Get on, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get off, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get on, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get off, we can keep it on the low)\n\n\n\nWarmer to us, warmer to love\n\nWarmer to everything we can seem to touch\n\n\n\nDim the light, close your eyes\n\nHere again to test the water\n\nAlways fight what we find\n\nBut we search a little longer\n\n\n\nThere's no truth we're second guessing\n\nThere's not use in not confessing\n\nNever right, but tonight\n\nThink we might be getting warmer\n\n\n\n(Get on, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get off, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get on, we can keep it on the low)\n\n(Get off, we can keep it on the low)",
