  "lyrics": "I won't tell you I'm lonely\r\n'Cause it might be selfish\r\nI won't ask you to hold me\r\n'Cause that won't mend what's helpless\r\nThere's not a thing I could say\n\nNot a song I could sing\n\nFor your mind to change\n\nNothing can fill up the space\n\nWon't ask you to stay\n\nBut let me ask you one thing\n\n\n\nOh, when did you fall out of love?\n\nOut of love\n\nOh, when did you fall out of love with me?\n\n\n\nI can't float in an ocean\n\nThat's already been drained\n\nI won't cry at your feet now\n\nI know my tears will fall in vain\n\n\n\nThere's not a thing I could say\n\nNot a song I could sing\n\nFor your mind to change\n\nNothing can fill up the space\n\nWon't ask you to stay\n\nBut let me ask you one thing\n\n\n\nOh, when did you fall out of love?\n\nOut of love\n\nOh, when did you fall out of love with me?\n\n\n\nNo use wondering\n\nWhile your change in heart has wandered\n\nSo I ask you this question\n\n'Cause it might help me sleep longer\n\n\n\nOh, when did you fall out of love?\n\nOut of love\n\nOh, when did you run out of love for me?\n\nOut of love (Out of love)\n\nOut of love (Out of love)\n\nOut of love with me",
