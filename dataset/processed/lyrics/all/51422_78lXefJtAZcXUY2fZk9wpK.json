  "lyrics": "And though you never take my hand\r\nEven when I raise your shipwreck from the sand\r\nAnd though you never count the cost\r\nOf the innocence you've lost and what it meant\r\nYou don't have to love me\n\nThere's one thing you should know\n\nMy love will not unravel\n\nIts unconditional\n\n\n\nMy indigo\n\nEven the heart won't let show, you don't have say, to let me know\n\nMy indigo...\n\nEven the heart won't let show, you don't have say, to let me know\n\nMy indigo...\n\n\n\nInk burns on the page blue to black, but words are fireproof\n\nCan't take back\n\nWhile the memories alive\n\nWhen there's pennies on our eyes, we'll never rest\n\nCan we take a second now\n\nTo rain down the heavy storm that's on our chest\n\n\n\nYou don't have to love me\n\nThere's one thing you should know\n\nMy love will not unravel\n\nIts unconditional\n\n\n\nMy indigo\n\nEven the heart won't let show, you don't have say, to let me know\n\nMy indigo...\n\nEven the heart won't let show, you don't have say, to let me know\n\nMy indigo...\n\n\n\nYou don't have to love me\n\nThere's one thing you should know\n\nMy love will not unravel\n\nIts unconditional\n\n\n\nMy indigo\n\nEven the heart won't let show, you don't have say, to let me know\n\nMy indigo\n\nEven the heart won't let show, you don't have say, to let me know\n\n\n\nI call what we have indigo",
