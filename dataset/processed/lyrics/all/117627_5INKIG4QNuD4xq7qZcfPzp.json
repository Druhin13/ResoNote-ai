Sahlo \n\nFolina Sahlo \n\nFolina Sahlo\n\n\n\nI could take the high road\n\nBut I know that I'm going low\n\nI'm a ban—I'm a bandito\n\nI could take the high road\n\nBut I know that I'm going low\n\nI'm a ban—I'm a bandito\n\nI could take the high road\n\nBut I know that I'm going low\n\nI'm a ban—I'm a bandito\n\n\n\nI created this world\n\nTo feel some control\n\nDestroy it if I want\n\nSo I sing\n\nSahlo Folina\n\nSahlo Folina",
