  "lyrics": "Line of limousines leaving one by one\r\nThe prayers been prayed\r\nThe hymns been sung\r\nBlack mascara's already run\r\nBut the tears keep flowing\r\nYou can blame it on hate or blame it on guns, but mamas ain't supposed to bury their sons\n\nLeft a hole in her heart and it still ain't done\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin'\n\n\n\nThrough every branch of his family tree\n\nEvery birthday that he'll never see\n\nEvery chance to live a good life that was stolen\n\nThrough the son he'll never get to raise\n\nHis daughter on her wedding day\n\nWishin' it was his hands she was holdin'\n\n'Till every heart that's left to break is broken\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin'\n\n\n\nThe grass grows back around the stone\n\nAnd friends stop checkin' in on the phone\n\nThe camera crews have all moved on\n\nBut the wound's still open\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin'\n\n\n\nThrough every branch of his family tree\n\nEvery birthday that he'll never see\n\nEvery chance to live a good life that was stolen\n\nThrough the son he'll never get to raise\n\nHis daughter on her wedding day\n\nWishin' it was his hands she was holdin'\n\n'Till every heart that's left to break is broken\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin'\n\nOh, whoa\n\n\n\nLine of limousines leaving one by one\n\nThe prayers been prayed\n\nThe hands been sung\n\nOh, mamas ain't supposed to bury their sons\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin'\n\n\n\nThrough the son he'll never get to raise\n\nHis daughter on her wedding day\n\nWishin' it was his hands she was holdin'\n\n'Till every heart that's left to break is broken\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin'\n\nThe bullet keeps on goin",
