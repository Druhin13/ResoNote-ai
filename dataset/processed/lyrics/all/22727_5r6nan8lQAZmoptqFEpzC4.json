  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Way Out Here par Current Joys\r\nIf you want to leave me\nWill you leave me in your mind?\nAnd think of me some evening\nIn the evening of our lives\n'Cause the way I am keeps changing\nAnd I just need a little time\n'Cause the sentiment of feelings\nLeads to ordinary lives and I want mine\n\nIf you want to keep me\nWill you help keep me alive?\n'Cause suicide's too easy\nAnd there's too much on my mind\n'Cause the way I am won't change\nUntil I stop asking why\nOh, the sentiment of feelings\n\nLead to ordinary lives and I want mine",
