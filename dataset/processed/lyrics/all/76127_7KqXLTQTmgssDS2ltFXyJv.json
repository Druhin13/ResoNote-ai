  "lyrics": "When I first saw you, I thought you weren't right, not my type\r\nBut you pulled the thread and got in my head\r\nMy head, my head\r\nAnd by the end of the night, I could see a light in your eye\r\nAnd you never got boring, keep telling me stories\r\nSo I thought maybe for the first time baby\n\nYou are, you are, you are, you are the one\n\nThinking to myself maybe he's the one that could save me\n\nFrom always being cynical and feeling over-critical\n\n\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\n\n\nNever tell, never tell\n\nIs it going right, going well?\n\nBut I'm giving in and trusting the feeling\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nBut in the back of my mind, I could get attached over time\n\nBut like a piece of chocolate, I never could drop it\n\n\n\nAnd when it's raining, I like when we just stay in\n\nThe world can wait another day\n\nIf I let my brain win, it would all just cave in\n\nAnd I'd be hypocritical, run from the things I really want\n\n\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\n\n\nOh maybe we'll go slow\n\nMaybe we will roll back\n\nMaybe we'll stand tall\n\nMaybe we\n\n\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up\n\nSo all night, I'm giving it up\n\nThat's why I'm giving it up\n\nWhen you give me that smile, I'm giving it up\n\nWhen I see you outside, I'm giving it up",
