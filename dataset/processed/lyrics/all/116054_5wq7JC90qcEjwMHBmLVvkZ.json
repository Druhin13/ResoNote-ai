  "lyrics": "I was supposed to do great things\r\nI'd know the rule's law\r\nBut I wasn't raised to shoot for fame\r\nI had the safety on\r\nI cut my ties, I sold my rings\r\nI wanted none of this\n\nIf you start from scratch and have to sing,\n\nJust for the fun of it\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nI'll be alright, if I could just see you\n\nCome up for air, come up for air,\n\nA miracle mile where does it lead to?\n\nCome up for air, come up for air,\n\n\n\nI feel the air upon my face, forget the mess I'm in\n\nHold me again, don't count mistakes, I lost track of them\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nI'll be alright, if I could just see you\n\nCome up for air, come up for air,\n\nA miracle mile where does it lead to?\n\nCome up for air, come up for air,\n\n\n\nI was in the mud, I was in the dirt\n\nWent underground and I thought what I was worth\n\nAll alone and I know I can't stay, but\n\nWe're walking up and down the streets to stay awake\n\n\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\n\n\nGet outside, get out over the world\n\n a little love, what you can return\n\n adrenaline and let me push some \n\nBut you . and breathe one breath a time\n\n\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\nCome up for air, come up for air, come up\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nI'll be alright, if I could just see you\n\nCome up for air, come up for air,\n\nA miracle mile where does it lead to?\n\nCome up for air, come u? for air,\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nI'll be alright, if I could just see you\n\nA miracle mile where does it lead to?",
