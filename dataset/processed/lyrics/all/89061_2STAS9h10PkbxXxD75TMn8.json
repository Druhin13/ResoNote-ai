  "lyrics": "A hundred days have made me older\r\nSince the last time that I saw your pretty face\r\nA thousand lies have made me colder\r\nAnd I don't think I can look at this the same\r\nBut all the miles that separate\r\nThey disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face\n\n\n\nI'm here without you baby\n\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\n\nI think about you baby\n\nAnd I dream about you all the time\n\nI'm here without you baby\n\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\n\nAnd tonight it's only you and me\n\n\n\nThe miles just keep rollin'\n\nAs the people leave their way to say hello\n\nI've heard this life is overrated\n\nBut I hope that it gets better as we go\n\n\n\nI'm here without you baby\n\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\n\nI think about you baby\n\nAnd I dream about you all the time\n\nI'm here without you baby\n\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\n\nAnd tonight girl its only you and me\n\n\n\nEverything I know, and anywhere I go\n\nIt gets hard but it wont take away my love\n\nAnd when the last one falls\n\nWhen it's all said and done\n\nIt gets hard but it wont take away my love\n\n\n\nI'm here without you baby\n\nBut you're still on my lonely mind\n\nI think about you baby\n\nAnd I dream about you all the time\n\nI'm here without you baby\n\nBut you're still with me in my dreams\n\nAnd tonight girl its only you and me",
