  "lyrics": "All my life I've been a slave to a pardon\r\nMy eyes transfixed somewhere far over the Jordan\r\nAnd all my years I've wanted someone to die for\r\nSo I had a reason I burned\r\nBut I've never been where you were born\n\nOr felt the things that broke your heart\n\nCome talk to me\n\nCome talk to me\n\nI want to understand\n\n\n\nAnd when we both grow old\n\nAnd there's nothing left to say\n\nI want you to know\n\nThat I loved you all my days\n\nAnd when we close our eyes on this lifetime\n\nI'll see you on the other side\n\nYes, I'll see you on the other side\n\n\n\nI would count myself lucky, love to entertain you\n\nTo find myself in the things that complicate you\n\nAnd spend my life in Your Majesty's service\n\nAnd I'd call myself satisfied\n\n\n\nBut in our limb of bone and lace\n\nAnd time and love and body aches\n\nI loved you more\n\nI loved you more\n\nBut a clock keeps ticking down\n\n\n\nAnd when we both grow old\n\nAnd there's nothing left to say\n\nI want you to know\n\nThat I loved you all my days\n\nAnd when we close our eyes on this lifetime\n\nI'll see you on the other side\n\nYes, I'll see you on the other side\n\n\n\nIf you hold on\n\nHold on\n\nHold on to me\n\n\n\nAnd when we both grow old\n\nAnd there's nothing left to say\n\nI want you to know\n\nThat I loved you all my days\n\nAnd when we close our eyes on this lifetime\n\nI'll see you on the other side\n\nYes, I'll see you on the other side\n\n\n\nAnd when we both grow old\n\nAnd there's nothing left to say\n\nI want you to know\n\nThat I loved you all my days\n\nAnd when we close our eyes on this lifetime\n\nI'll see you on the other side\n\nYes, I'll see you on the other side",
