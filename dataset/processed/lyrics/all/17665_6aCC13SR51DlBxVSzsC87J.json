  "lyrics": "Call it a quick fix, quick fix, quick fix\r\nCall it the glue between the glass\r\nFind me in basements, wasted, drink sick\r\nHolding a faded treasure map\r\nI could be better to you\r\nAs sure as the stars surround\r\nEdge of the bed in your room\r\nYour clothes on the frozen ground\r\nBeauty and the bends\r\nWe could start again, we could start again\r\nHoney, here I am, holding on\r\nNoises in the night, I could get it right for once\r\nBeauty and the bends\r\nWe could start again, we could start again\r\nHoney, here I am, holding on\r\nNoises in the night, I could get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nAll of my secrets, secrets, secrets\r\nDigging up ten feet underneath\r\nBuried in bed rock, back lots, shades drawn\r\nPraying this wave may wash me clean\r\nI could be better to you\r\nAs sure as the stars surround\r\nEdge of the bed in your room\r\nYour clothes on the frozen ground\r\nBeauty and the bends\r\nWe could start again, we could start again\r\nHoney, here I am, holding on\r\nNoises in the night, I could get it right for once\r\nBeauty and the bends\r\nWe could start again, we could start again\r\nHoney, here I am, holding on\r\nNoises in the night, I could get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nBeauty and the bends\r\nWe could start again, we could start again\r\nHoney, here I am, holding on\r\nNoises in the night, I could get it right for once\r\n(I could get it right, I will get it right)\r\nBeauty and the bends\r\nWe could start again, we could start again\r\nHoney, here I am, holding on\r\nNoises in the night, I could get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nI could get it right, I will get it right\r\nGet it right for once",
