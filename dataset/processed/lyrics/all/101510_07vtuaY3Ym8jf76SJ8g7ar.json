  "lyrics": "They're writing songs of love\r\nBut not for me \nLucky star's above\r\nBut not for me\r\n\nWith love to lead the way \n\nI've found more clouds of grey \n\nthan any Russian play could guarantee\n\n\n\nI was a fool to fall, get that way\n\nHeigh-ho! Alas! Also, lack-a-day!\n\nWhen every happy plot\n\nTurns into a marriage knot\n\nI guess he's not for me",
