  "lyrics": "We'll live when I flip the clutch\r\nDays when I wasted a lot\r\nSome days I was waste like plums that ain't been ate for months\r\nMonths in this place of glum\r\nFood that I ate hit my tum\r\nCan't settle fairy tale skin pebbles, raised in slums\n\nSomehow I gotta make me some, I ain't tryna stay at mom's\n\nMom said don't play with guns, banging and playing on drums\n\nSlanging it under no thumb, made me draw from my fund\n\nPutting on pie and eating crumbs\n\nGet rich till ya die don't mean that much\n\n\n\nCould be anyone that wouldn't be me\n\nBelieving everyone except for me\n\nAll I need is TLC, block it out with THC\n\nYou would know if you seen what I seen\n\nAin't smooth like Maybelline\n\nCount me out like 1, 2, 3, proof I'm gone say my move was strong\n\nBite it between my teeth, said I'm moving along\n\nDo you know where I've been?\n\nBack and forth to Timbuktu, still, I come through like Mr Sheen\n\nDealing with Charlie Sheens, sad times, can you play the strings?\n\nNo cut, no seam, looks could kill and I've got high beams\n\n\n\nOut of touch, off my line, they got laws but I can't comply\n\nOut of luck, must be blind\n\nBeen blessed so much till I question my existence\n\nWithout a pot to piss in, distant\n\nTravel distance, I am Mr. Kiddlin\n\nCan't contain my position\n\nNo optimism, say I'm optimistic\n\nNarcissistic, hard to sit with\n\nMiddle part and split the difference\n\nMe, treat me to exorcism\n\nBad decision, pessimistic\n\nConflict about fit description\n\nMisunderstanding don't know what I'm planning\n\nPaint a different picture\n\nNeed a safe line and life in the caption\n\nWhy you live for Insta?",
