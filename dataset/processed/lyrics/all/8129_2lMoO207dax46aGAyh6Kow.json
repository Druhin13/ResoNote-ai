  "lyrics": "No, it's not how you do it\r\nIt's not like you're being discrete\r\nRunning round the nation\r\nAvoiding this and reality\r\nAnd what we have and who we know\r\nAnd walking down our street\n\n\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\n(I can see the way this will go down)\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\n(I can see the, I can see the way this will go down)\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\n\n\nIt's not how you do it\n\nIt's not like you're being discrete\n\nSaying you need time but just back-burning the shit out of me\n\nSo I can't let things go back to the place they used to be\n\n\n\n'Cause you're gonna run\n\n'Cause you're gonna run\n\n'Cause you're gonna run\n\n(I can see the way this will go down)\n\n'Cause you're gonna run\n\n(I can see the, I can see the way this will go down)\n\nAnd you're gonna run\n\n\n\nI can see the way this will go down\n\nYou're just another lost and found\n\nAnd if you're fine with how we parted\n\nI'll go finish what we started\n\nIf you can't look me in the eyes\n\nI won't look back, don't be surprised\n\nPlease just don't kick me when I'm down\n\nYou're just another lost and found\n\nOut of all my friends, I'm the only person\n\nThat understands we're done\n\nThey said go and get her\n\nPart of me thinks you will put down your gun\n\nThe other part knows better\n\n\n\nAnd you're gonna run\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\n(I can see the way this will go down\n\nYou're just another lost and found)\n\nSo you're gonna run\n\n(I can see the, I can see the way this will go down)",
