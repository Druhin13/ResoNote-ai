  "lyrics": "Magic\r\nNow I believe in forces\r\nI need the truth, the reason why\r\nWas so amazed, such a lucky child\r\nAnd then something died\n\nLike everybody it hurt inside\n\nAnd I would walk to the city with my wounded pride\n\nBut everybody is too busy and you're wondering why\n\nThere's a hole inside\n\nI need a pill, not an alibi\n\n\n\nNow it's all coming together\n\nAnd it breaks like a storm\n\nThis is our kind of weather\n\n\n\n'Cause now that I believe in magic\n\nI believe in your lips\n\nI believe things coming away\n\nNow I believe in forces\n\nI believe it's all said\n\nNothing here can make me sway\n\nAnd now that I believe in magic\n\nNothing can confound us\n\nNothing can explain away\n\nNow I believe in forces\n\nI believe in your steps\n\nTaking me some other way\n\n\n\nLost inhibition, I'd lose my mind\n\nReality was no friend of mine\n\nSo I thought I knew\n\nBut everybody's just kidding you\n\nAnd I remember when I stumbled on a slippery stone\n\nI was in the jungle and I couldn't get home\n\nWas in a zoo\n\nWithout a single clue\n\n\n\nNow it's all coming together\n\nAnd it breaks like a storm\n\nThis is our kind of weather\n\n\n\n'Cause now that I believe in magic\n\nI believe in forces\n\n\n\nI believe in magic\n\nI believe in your lips\n\nI believe things coming away\n\nNow I believe in forces\n\nI believe it's all said\n\nNothing here can make me sway\n\nAnd now that I believe in magic\n\nNothing can confound us\n\nNothing can explain away\n\nNow I believe in forces\n\nI believe in your steps\n\nTaking me some other way\n\n\n\nI believe in magic\n\nI believe in forces",
