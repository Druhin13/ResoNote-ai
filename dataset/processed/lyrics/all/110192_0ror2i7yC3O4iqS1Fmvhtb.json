You ain't gotta hold on no more\n\nIf you got a good thing, go for it\n\nWe ain't with the bad things no more\n\nYo, you gotta let go. Let go!\n\nYou ain't gotta hold on no more\n\nIf you got a good thing, go for it\n\nWe ain't with the bad things no more\n\n\n\nThey be saying Karma is a bitch, ah\n\nBut I don't let them talk about my friends, nah\n\nYou was taking people from their kids, now you bitter cause I'm chillin' with my kin now, wow\n\nI don't eat if I didn't pull it from the ground\n\nGotta a lot of love so I give to the crowd\n\nMan I swear my great, great Grandma would be proud\n\nWe ain't pickin' cotton, I'm the nigga with the crown\n\n\n\n\"Thank you very much, its uh, privilege and a honor to be a in the white intellectual ghetto of the West\"\n\n\n\nIn the car, in LA on the 99\n\nSunrise, Red Sky, Ambience\n\nBad days, Rear view, and they stay behind\n\nPH 'round 9, livin' alkaline\n\nBlack boy, You could be what you want to be\n\nYou the one that carry that baton when they come for me\n\nCame from, the concrete that's a fizzy fact\n\nCame up, clear streams in the grizzy grass\n\n\n\nKeepin' it honest\n\nThey try to kill you, I promise\n\nThey do it all for the commas\n\nI stay alive for my children, I don't be trustin' they doctors\n\nPoliticians is phony, they be villians, imposters\n\nThey gonna tell you its gold, but show it really be copper\n\nAnd they don't want you tappin' into all that spirit inside us\n\nThey want you chasin' the carrot\n\nWant you fiendin for pradas\n\nThey want you sick til you vomit\n\nCause you no use when you concious",
