  "lyrics": "Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?\r\nIn the lane, snow is glistening\r\nA beautiful sight\r\nWe're happy tonight\r\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n\nGone away is the bluebird\n\nHere to stay is a new bird\n\nHe sings a love song\n\nAs we go along\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n\n\n\nIn the meadow we can build a snowman\n\nThen pretend that he is Parson Brown\n\nHe'll say, \"Are you married?\"\n\nWe'll say, \"No man\n\n\"But you can do the job when you're in town\"\n\n\n\nLater on, we'll conspire\n\nAs we dream by the fire\n\nTo face unafraid\n\nThe plans that we've made\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n\n\n\nIn the meadow we can build a snowman\n\nAnd pretend that he's a circus clown\n\nWe'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman\n\nUntil the other kids knock him down\n\n\n\nLater on, we'll conspire\n\nAs we dream by the fire\n\nTo face unafraid\n\nThe plans that we've made\n\nWalking in a winter wonderland\n\n\n\nWe're walking, yes we're walking in a winter wonderland",
