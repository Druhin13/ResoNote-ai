  "lyrics": "One, two, three\r\nI found boxes of first CDs tryin' to get my office clean\r\nTook ten years of folks givin' them to me 'til I sat down\r\nAnd I saw hesitant poses and torn up jeans\r\nIn cover photos friends took for free\n\nFor the six minute songs, and all their life-long dreams the world turned down\n\n\n\nThey're just dreamin' up some life out on the road, oh\n\nWhen all I dream about's the day that I'll be home\n\nI'd long forgotten how it feels to chase a dream\n\nThank God for boxes of first CDs, yeah\n\n\n\nOn through this Rolodex of railroad tracks and fresh-cut hair\n\nI see Joy who won some Grammys and is now a millionaire\n\nLooks different now than she does right there, but that's how it goes\n\nAs for the rest, I bet they're teachers or pastors now\n\nPictured in jackets girlfriends picked out\n\nAll their hometowns turned these up, all the labels turned them down, and never wrote (whoa)\n\n\n\nThey're just dreamin' up some life out on the road, oh\n\nWhen all I dream about's the day that I'll be home\n\nI guess I forgot the way it feels to chase a dream\n\nThank God for boxes of first CDs, yeah\n\n\n\nA thrift store jacket and ten less pounds\n\nLookin' like a fool in some big field with my bare feet on the ground\n\nBad song titles and worse drum sounds, I didn't know\n\n\n\nThat all my dreams had come true out here on the road\n\nI never dreamed that I could call this life my own\n\nThought I'd forgotten how it feels to chase a dream\n\nBut thank God for how it feels to chase a dream\n\nAnd thank God for boxes of first CDs, yeah",
