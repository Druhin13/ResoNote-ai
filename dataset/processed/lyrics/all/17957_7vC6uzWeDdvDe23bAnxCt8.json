  "lyrics": "I've been running around without a place to go\r\nAlways chasing down another dead end road\r\nNever finding what I though I'd find\r\nBetter life, better job, better me.\r\nI'm a prisoner, I'll tell you honestly\r\nCaptured by the world and all it offers me\r\nHow I need your grace to finally fix this heart these eyes on You\r\nMy heart my eyes on You.\r\nSet me free from the pressure that I need to please the world around me\r\nSo I believe what you say what you say who I am\r\nI'm Everything to You\r\n♪\r\nI'm Everything to You\r\n♪\r\nCome now fountain every blessing\r\nTune my heart to sing like grace\r\nStreams of mercy never ceasing\r\nCall for songs about his praise\r\nSet me free from the pressure that I need to please the world around me\r\nSo I believe what you say what you say who I am\r\nI'm Everything to You\r\nI'm Everything to You\r\n♪\r\nOh LORD, I'm sick of all this stuff,\r\nSick of this mess that I've made,\r\nSick of these I sing, they've piled enough, I need you.\r\nI'm sick of comparing myself to everybody that I see.\r\nAll of these chains are gonna say\r\nI wanna be changed, i wanna be free, i wanna be me.\r\nThe way that you made me,\r\nThe word is true,\r\nYou are the reason I do what I do\r\nI know you rule and I'm Everything to You.\r\nSo my burdens are laying down __...\r\n__...\r\nYou are the reason I'm singing these songs,\r\nYou are the one who took away my wrong.\r\nYou are the Christ, You gave your Life and I'm Everything to You.\r\n♪\r\nSet me free from the pressure that I need to please the world around me\r\nSo I believe what you say what you say who I am\r\nI'm Everything to You\r\nI'm Everything to You",
