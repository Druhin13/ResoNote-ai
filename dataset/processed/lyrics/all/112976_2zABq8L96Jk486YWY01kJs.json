  "lyrics": "Love is a rose\r\nbut you better not pick it\r\nIt only grows when it's on the vine.\r\nA handful of thorns and\r\nyou'll know you've missed it\r\nYou lose your love\n\nwhen you say the word \"mine\".\n\n\n\nI wanna see what's never been seen,\n\nI wanna live that age old dream.\n\nCome on, lads, we can go together\n\nLet's take the best right now,\n\nTake the best right now.\n\n\n\nI wanna go to an old hoe-down\n\nLong ago in a western town.\n\nPick me up cause my feet are draggin'\n\nGive me a lift and I'll hay your wagon.\n\n\n\nLove is a rose\n\nbut you better not pick it\n\nIt only grows when it's on the vine.\n\nA handful of thorns and\n\nyou'll know you've missed it\n\nYou lose your love\n\nwhen you say the word \"mine\".\n\nMine, mine.\n\n\n\nLove is a rose, love is a rose.\n\nLove is a rose, love is a rose.",
