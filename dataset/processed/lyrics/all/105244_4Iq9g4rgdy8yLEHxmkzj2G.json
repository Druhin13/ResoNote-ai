  "lyrics": "You need not, to climb mountaintops\r\nYou need not, to cross the sea\r\nYou need not, to find a cure\r\nfor everything that makes you weak.\r\nYou need not to reach for the stars,\n\nwhen life becomes so dark\n\nand when the wind\n\ndoes blow against the grain\n\nyou must follow your heart\n\nyou must follow your heart\n\n\n\nwhen all your friends\n\nhave come and gone\n\nthe sun no longer shines\n\nthe happiness for which you long\n\nis washed away, like an oceans tide\n\nwhen all the hard times, outweigh the good\n\nand all your words are misunderstood\n\n\n\nwhen the day seems lost from the stars\n\nyou must follow your heart\n\nyou must follow your heart\n\n\n\nIf you feel, you paid the price\n\nand your wounds should cease to heal\n\nand everything you love in life,\n\nspins like a winding wheel\n\nif you should wake, to find you're abandoned.\n\nand the road you travel, leads to a dead end\n\n\n\nwhen death creeps in, to play it's part.\n\nyou must you follow your heart\n\nyou must follow your heart",
