  "lyrics": "I'm fire girl yelling mayday\r\nBut don't stop girl\r\nLying in the maybes\r\nWhy you have to be so amazing?\r\nThe smoke in my eyes is so hazy\r\nYou got me breaking it down\n\nYou got me moving to a brand new sound\n\n\n\nI'm sorry for the things that i said on the phone\n\nIgnored when you told me to leave you the heck alone\n\nI'm sorry if i acted a little kid no, no\n\nI'm sorry for this\n\n\n\nLooking at the corner you've been eyeing me\n\nAre you tired of all the things you see?\n\nI know i'm just a little bit lazy\n\nBut you can be so impatient\n\nAlways dreaming of a better day\n\nLike we on the beach in Marseilles\n\nOr on the hill looking at LA\n\n\n\nWalking through the city with no cares\n\nWalking down the beach to slow steps\n\nTop floor elevator no stairs\n\nBut i'm not at home and it's not fair\n\n\n\nI'm sorry for the things that i said on the phone\n\nIgnored when you told me to leave you the heck alone\n\nI'm sorry if i acted a little kid no, no\n\nI'm sorry for this\n\n\n\nWhen it's you and i and the kids have grown\n\nAnd all these seeds i've sown\n\nAnd all these paths i've walked\n\nThese conversations talked\n\nI'm still gonna bleed for you\n\nI'm still gonna need you\n\nI'm still gonna want you\n\nCause i'm still in love with you\n\n\n\nI'm sorry for the things that i said on the phone\n\nIgnored when you told me to leave you the heck alone\n\nI'm sorry if i acted a little kid no, no\n\nI'm sorry for this",
