  "lyrics": "We're leaving all the windows open\r\nWe don't even mind the rain\r\nOr where we let the floors get wet\r\nSo what if the hardwood stains\r\nCause we're collecting evidence\r\nOf one remarkable storm\n\nHow wild it was to find it and finally feel the climate\n\nInstead of only staying dry and warm\n\n\n\nRain on us\n\nSaint Honesty\n\nSalvation is coming in the morning but now what we need\n\nIs a little rain on our face from you sweet Saint Honesty\n\n\n\nSo we won't sleep tonight\n\nWhile we brace against the wind\n\nOh these hearts they're weather-makers\n\nWe'll go where they take us\n\nTill we find ourselves shelter again\n\nWe won't settle for the silence\n\nWe won't drown in the tears\n\nWe'll say every single word even if we think they'll hurt\n\nLet the rain wash away these tears\n\n\n\nRain on us\n\nSaint Honesty\n\nSalvation is coming in the morning but now what we need\n\nIs a little rain on our face from you sweet Saint Honesty\n\n\n\nOh, we won't let go\n\nWe'll be soaked to the bone\n\nBaptized by truth we will reap what we sow\n\nBuild our own higher ground\n\nWhen the rain's coming down\n\nThis is worth it to me\n\nSaint Honesty\n\n\n\nRain...\n\nSalvation is coming in the morning\n\nWe'll wait patiently aiming straight for it\n\nBut now what we need\n\nIs a little rain on our face from you sweet Saint Honesty",
