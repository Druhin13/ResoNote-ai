  "lyrics": "You don't need a team of lawyers lookin' for evidence\r\nYou don't need a piece of paper tryin' to prove your intent\r\nTo be free\r\nYou don't need to look back, easy, if you said what you meant\r\nYou don't need your heart runnin' at a hundred percent\r\nAll you need\n\n\n\nI don't need a deposition to believe what you said\n\nI don't need a crystal ball to hear the thoughts in your head\n\nI can see\n\nI don't need a judge and jury to determine our fate\n\nI don't need a priest to tell me that you ain't been a saint\n\nAll we need is me\n\n\n\nI'm tired of hearin' 'bout your flaws\n\nAnd all the broken laws\n\nAnd the hearts you've left behind\n\nIt's not up to you to make up my mind\n\n\n\nSo free yourself up to love me\n\nJust love me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nIf you can\n\nSo free yourself up to love me\n\nJust love me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nIf you can\n\n\n\nYou don't need to call a doctor, show me where you've been cut\n\nYou don't need to call a locksmith, I can tell the door's shut\n\nWhere's the key?\n\nI don't need to see a lineup, I know who's been involved\n\nDon't you turn yourself in, you know the crime has been solved\n\nYou are free, you are free\n\n\n\nI'm tired of hearin' 'bout your flaws\n\nAnd all the broken laws\n\nAnd the hearts you've left behind\n\nWell, it's not up to you to make up my mind\n\nAnd if in hindsight it's a mistake, at least we tried\n\n\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nJust love me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nIf you can\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nJust love me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nIf you can\n\n\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nJust love me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nIf you can\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nJust love me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up to love me\n\nIf you can\n\n\n\nFree yourself up\n\nLove me like a good man\n\nFree yourself up\n\nWell love me, well love me like a good man\n\nIf you can\n\nLove me like a good man",
