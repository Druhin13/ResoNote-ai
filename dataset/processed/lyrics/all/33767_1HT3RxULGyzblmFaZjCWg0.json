  "lyrics": "My album charted mandem thought I was\r\nBut I'm back on my grind like recording is long\r\nCuh they don't wanna let me through the door like Jehovah witness\r\nSo I'm back selling raw on the road to riches\r\nI just made six figures off of streams\r\nStill dealing with the fiends cuh I got bigger dreams\n\nFeeling like John Gotti I'm the last mob\n\nNo Ammi so I'm out in manny copping star dog\n\nSend my nigga rebel out I don't take trips\n\nI looked in the mirror getting followed by like 8 Whips\n\nI did a U-Turn saw all the cars yewy too\n\nNow I'm scared thinking to myself what shall I do\n\nSo hot them other trapstars don't wanna roll with me\n\nBack on the strip with the crabs but its no biggie\n\nSkrapz told me make sure that you don't re-up\n\nAll I do is trap I don't know how to put my feet up\n\nSo I went to check my bedrin\n\nWhen I left I saw a fed put down his coffee and start his engine\n\nNow I'm thinking fuck I can't even trap\n\nThey won't let me do shows a nigga can't even rap\n\nPlus I got these fools tryna diss me on a track\n\nBut we'll see what happens all these haters wishing I get clapped\n\nI should fly out but I just wanna get this dough\n\nI keep hurting girls I care about I wish they let me go\n\nSo let me tell how life without trappings going\n\nSitting on the block watching all them other trappers going\n\nThinking I can make a quick 100K\n\nEven though I probably waste it on a watch and another chain\n\nWould be rich if it weren't for them times I lost bread\n\nI was playing Fifa Pebs called me said the crops dead\n\nNow what shall I do I'm used to moving keys in the city\n\nGoing crazy I need to be busy\n\nSo I went Glasgow to see Flanders\n\nThinking I can take this over they ain't even got no cameras\n\nYou wouldn't think that I got signed\n\nThe same time I was on the charts tryna build a dot line\n\nThen I got nicked on the mains with a fiend\n\nWish I was like them other rappers raping the scene\n\nNiggas think I'm rich but it ain't what it seems\n\nYeah I got dough but I got 8 figure dreams\n\nMy chicks acting up that's the last of my problems\n\nCuh I nearly got remanded in Scotland\n\nMe and F.G caught a plane every morning\n\nTo go court I should be on stage somewhere touring\n\nI'm going back to jail is what I thought at my trial\n\nBuss case we had aces in the court like Nadal\n\nI swear down I need a new lane\n\nThe plug ain't my friend I'm still at the bottom of the food chain\n\nStill can't get support from the radio\n\nBut that don't phase me yo\n\nAs long as I'm making though\n\nSo I started thinking of a master plan\n\nJump back in the rentals gave my car to Shan\n\nAnd these days I spend the most on bud\n\nThat don't make sense cos I know the plug\n\nI went Cali for Gelato straight facts\n\nYou would think I was tryna fuck up my spine tryna get that straight back\n\nCame home gassed giving chains to my favourite nitty\n\nMight change this shit from Ice to Flavours city\n\nSo holla if you need an ounce bro\n\nBout to leave my workers number on the outro",
