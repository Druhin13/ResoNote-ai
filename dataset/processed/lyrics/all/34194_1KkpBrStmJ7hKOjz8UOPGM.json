  "lyrics": "Save us\r\nIf you thought you knew it all\r\nDon't shift your view, you might slip and fall\r\nA long way down and down this rabbit hole\r\nIf the tunnel runs any deeper you might come out the other side of the world\n\nMaybe upside down you'll be able to see\n\nThis isn't what it seems\n\nWe are far from free\n\n\n\nWe're caught in the undertow\n\nDeeper and deeper\n\nInto the unknown\n\nWe're caught in the undertow\n\nFollow the leader\n\nDown with the undertow\n\n\n\nAction floats in limbo Like driftwood in the sea\n\nUnder CCTV, so dig down deep\n\nThe more you uncover, the more you disbelieve\n\nThe more you will discover\n\nWe are far from free\n\n\n\nHeroes exposing\n\nCorruption in who we obey\n\nBlow the whistle from a burning stake\n\n\n\nThe whistle blows from a burning stake\n\nCorruption won't keep revolution at bay\n\n\n\nWe're caught in the undertow\n\nDeeper and deeper\n\nInto the unknown\n\nWe're caught in the undertow\n\nFollow the leader\n\nDown with the undertow\n\n\n\nSpied on, lifelong, collection 24/7\n\nArchives of all we've done\n\nSatellites track our lives beyond the skies\n\nNot even your mind can hide\n\nFrom big brother's eyes\n\n\n\nIt's time to take back our home\n\nThank you Mr. Snow",
