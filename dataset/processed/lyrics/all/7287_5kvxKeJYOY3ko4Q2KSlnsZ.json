  "lyrics": "Sticks and stones\r\nHurt harder when you know their thrown\r\nFrom no farther than your own sweet home\r\nAnd you fall flat on the welcome mat\r\nYou won't be welcomed at\r\nWalk that line\n\nThere's no when you gotta choose a side\n\nThere's no gray there's only black and white\n\nAnd it just ain't right\n\nIf we fight then it's just like\n\n\n\nPainting in the rain\n\nWalking in slow motion trying to catch a moving train\n\nWhy we overdosing just to dull a little pain\n\nJoining the parade just to march the other way\n\nIt's like painting in the rain\n\nFighting for a difference but we never wanna change\n\nRight foot lifted, left foot chained\n\nEyes wide opened but denying what we see\n\nWe might as well be out painting in the\n\nRain, rain, rain\n\nRain, rain, rain\n\n\n\nPaint the sky, with dark words\n\nIt's either do or die\n\nTo be heard you're gonna risk your life\n\nAnd if the walls don't crumble down and fall\n\nYou might just lose it all\n\nWalk away\n\nThere's no danger when you play it safe\n\nThere's no anger if you just behave\n\nBut if we don't fight for our rights\n\nThen it's just like\n\n\n\nPainting in the rain\n\nWalking in slow motion trying to catch a moving train\n\nWhy we overdosing just to dull a little pain\n\nJoining the parade just to march the other way\n\nIt's like painting in the rain\n\nFighting for a difference but we never wanna change\n\nRight foot lifted, left foot chained\n\nEyes wide opened but denying what we see, we might as well be out painting in the\n\nRain, rain, rain\n\nRain, rain, rain\n\n\n\nPainting in the rain\n\nWalking in slow motion trying to catch a moving train\n\nWhy we overdose just to dull a little pain\n\nJoining the parade just to march the other way\n\nIt's like painting in the rain\n\nFighting for a difference but we never wanna change\n\nRight foot lifted, left foot chained\n\nEyes wide open but denying what we see\n\nWe might as well be out painting in the rain\n\nWe might as well be out painting in the rain",
