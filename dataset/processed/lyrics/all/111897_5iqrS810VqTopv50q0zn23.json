  "lyrics": "This city is an empty glass\r\nWords do nothing\r\nNo one sleeps\r\nThis city is an empty glass\r\nThis city is an empty glass\n\nGraciousness is lost\n\nThe betrayed yearn\n\nThis city is an empty glass\n\n\n\nThis city is an empty glass\n\nShops are closed\n\nThere is nothing\n\nThis city is an empty glass\n\n\n\nThis city is an empty glass\n\nThe buildings shriek\n\nAs everything weeps\n\nThis city is an empty glass\n\n\n\nThe trees hang their heads\n\nAnd the wired wants faith, fray\n\nThe songs sing silently\n\nOh\n\nThis city is an empty glass (Clouds)\n\nThis city is an empty glass (Clouds)\n\n\n\nIn the air: shrieks (In the air: shrieks)\n\nThe breath is long (The breath is long)\n\nFor the fires are out (For the fires are out)\n\nThe waters sit still (The waters sit still)\n\nThis city\n\nThis city is an empty glass\n\nIn the air: shrieks\n\nThe breath is long\n\nAnd the fires are out\n\nThe waters sit still",
