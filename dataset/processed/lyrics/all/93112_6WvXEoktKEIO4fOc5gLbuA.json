  "lyrics": "I used to be afraid of myself\r\nHung my smile on a shelf\r\nHid my teeth when I laughed\r\nNow I'm far too grown for your plot, for your balm\r\nWill you root for me or will you leave?\n\nI don’t wanna compromise\n\nCan we make it through the night?\n\nI'm trying to see eye to eye\n\nBut you look right over me\n\nYour words stuck on repeat\n\nAnd I'm tired of you\n\n\n\nHow many times do I sit and listen to you?\n\nI don’t know why I keep sittin', listenin' to you\n\nHow many times do I sit and listen to you?\n\nI don't know why I keep sittin', listenin' to you\n\nHow many times do I sit and listen to you?\n\nI don't know why I keep sittin', listenin’ to you\n\nHow many times do I sit and listen to you?\n\nI don’t know why I keep sittin', listenin’ to you\n\nHow many times do I sit and listen to you?\n\nI don't know why I keep sittin', listenin' to you\n\n\n\nIt’s not that I'm bored\n\nI just heard it before\n\nThe space you take up\n\nThe curve of your learning\n\nThat's my labor, my love\n\nExplaining myself again\n\nI could have run a mile instead\n\nI could have twist my hands instead\n\nI'm laid out in bed\n\nGaslight in my head\n\nBut I said what I said\n\n\n\nI don't wanna compromise\n\nCan we make it through the night?\n\nI'm trying to see eye to eye\n\nBut you look right over me\n\nYour words stuck on repeat\n\nAnd I'm tired of your shit\n\n\n\nWho gonna share my love for me with me?\n\nWho gonna share my love for me with me?\n\nWho gonna share my love for me with me? With me? Yeah\n\nWho gonna share my love for me with me?\n\nWho gonna share my love for me with me?\n\nWho gonna share my love for me with me?\n\nWho gonna share my love?",
