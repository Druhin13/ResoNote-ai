  "lyrics": "Deep in your blood or a voice in your head\r\nOn a dark lonesome highway\r\nIt finds you instead\r\nSo certain it knows you, you can't turn away\r\nSomething or someone has found you today\n\nGenius or Jesus, maybe he's seen us\n\nBut who would believe us\n\nI can't really say\n\nWhatever the calling, the stumbling or falling\n\nYou follow it knowing\n\nThere's no other way, there's no other way\n\n\n\nThere are zealots and preachers\n\nAnd readers of dreams\n\nThe righteous yell loudest\n\nAnd the saved rise to sing\n\nThe lonely and lost are just waiting to hear\n\nAny moment their purpose\n\nWill be perfectly clear\n\n\n\nAnd then life would mean more\n\nThan their name on their door\n\nAnd that far distant shore that's so near\n\nThey'd hear the calling\n\nAnd stumbling and falling\n\nThey'd follow it knowing\n\nThere's nothing to fear\n\nNothing to fear\n\n\n\nI don't remember a voice\n\nOn a dark, lonesome road\n\nWhen I started this journey so long ago\n\nI was only just trying to outrun the noise\n\nThere was never a question of having a choice\n\n\n\nJesus or genie, maybe they've seen me\n\nBut who would believe me\n\nI can't really say\n\nWhatever the calling, the stumbling and falling\n\nI followed it knowing there's no other way\n\n\n\nJesus or genie, maybe he's seen me\n\nBut who would believe me\n\nI can't really say\n\nWhatever the calling, stumbling and falling\n\nI got through it knowing there's no other way\n\nThere's no other way",
