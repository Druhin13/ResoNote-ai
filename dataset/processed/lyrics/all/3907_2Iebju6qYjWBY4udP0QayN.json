  "lyrics": "Cold bones, yeah, that’s my love\r\nShe glides away, like a ghost\r\nDoes she know that we bleed the same?\r\nDon’t wanna cry but I break that way\n\nCold sheets, oh, where’s my love?\n\nI am searching high, I’m searching low in the night\n\n\n\nDoes she know that we bleed the same?\n\nDon’t wanna cry but I break that way\n\n\n\nDid she run away?\n\nDid she run away? I don’t know\n\nIf she ran away\n\nIf she ran away, come back home\n\nJust come home\n\n\n\nI got a fear, oh, in my blood\n\nShe was carried up into the clouds, high above\n\n\n\nIf you bled, I bleed the same\n\nIf you’re scared, I’m on my way\n\n\n\nDid you run away?\n\nDid you run away? I don’t need to know\n\nIf you ran away\n\nIf you ran away, come back home\n\nJust come home",
