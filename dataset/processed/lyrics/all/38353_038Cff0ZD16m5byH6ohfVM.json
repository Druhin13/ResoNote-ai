  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Birds Of Love par Monn\r\nWhat a breeze blown down from the top of the mountain\nIt moves me like an open sail\nSee the sky sweel up with a fountain of gold\nAnd break up open like an ocean wave\n\nSo I shake my bones with the boom of the thunder\nEchoing from up above\nThen I jump on the wings of an angel of wonder\nAnd coo with the birds of love\n\nBirds of love\nFly above\nBirds of love\nFly above\nBirds of love\n\nFly above\nBirds of love\nFly above\n\nTo the moon we race with the pace of a cheetah\nAnd catch a comet by the tail\nThen we swing on the rings spinning Saturn to Venus\nCrashing in a minor scale\n\nOn a cloud I wait for a ride on the lightning\nTo set me down from the sky\nHear the birds of love singing in the horizon\nA chorus so divine\n\nBirds of love\nFly above\nBirds of love\n\nFly above\nBirds of love\nFly above\nBirds of love\nFly above\n\nTill we don't know where we are\n\nBirds of love\nBirds of love\nBirds of love\nFly above\nBirds of love\nFly above\nBirds of love",
