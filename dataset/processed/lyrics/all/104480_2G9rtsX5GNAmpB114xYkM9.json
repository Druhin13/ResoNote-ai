  "lyrics": "Here by the lake, what a vision you are\r\nIn the light of the emerald star\r\nI’ve come for you, my love\r\nThrough a window in the dark\r\nDon’t you know you’re my everything?\r\nIf I lost you, I think I would die\n\nWas everything you said just a lie?\n\n\n\nYou never loved me\n\nI came all the way through time and space\n\nTo take you away and out of this place\n\nWith the moonlight in your eyes\n\nYou’re the brightest star in all of the sky\n\nI’ll cry and I’ll cry if your light ever dies\n\n\n\nOh, what a jewel are you\n\nAnd, oh, what a fool am I\n\nFor squandering my love\n\nOn an emerald in the sky\n\nWay out here in the void\n\nIs the loneliest place to die\n\nWhen everything you loved is a lie\n\n\n\nYou never loved me\n\nI came all the way through time and space\n\nTo take you away and out of this place\n\nYou’re an emerald in the sky\n\nYou light up the night by blinkin’ your eyes\n\nI’ll cry and I’ll cry if your light ever dies",
