  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Over It par The Frights\r\nI don't need to say what I said before\nYou never listened to me anyway, my voice is sore\nOr I'm not sick at all, I'm just sick of you\nAnd now you're coming back but I don't fucking miss you\nI never thought that you would be the one to break\nNow every time I see your name I get a stomach ache\nI know I did my best, I never sent a text\nAnd now I'm standing wishing, aren't you fucking dead yet?\n\nYou seem to think that we're more than this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nDon't try to act like you gave a shit\n\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\nWe used to be something, I admit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nI used to think we were over this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\nYou open up again, I'm closing every door\n'Cause once you called it off I never said I wanted more\nIt's hard to be this way, when you know everything\nAnd you're still hurting me for reasons that I can't explain\nI need to figure out a way to let it go\nIt's not okay to be afraid of someone I don't know\nAnd I could give it up but that would make me think\n\n'Bout how I'm freaking out every time a phone rings\n\nYou seem to think that we're more than this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nDon't try to act like you gave a shit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\nWe used to be something, I admit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nI used to think we were over this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\nYou seem to think that we're more than this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nDon't try to act like you gave a shit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\n\nWe used to be something I admit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nI used to think we were over this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\nYou seem to think that we're more than this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nDon't try to act like you gave a shit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?\n\nWe used to be something, I admit\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over it?\nI used to think we were over this\nAren't you over it? Aren't you over?",
