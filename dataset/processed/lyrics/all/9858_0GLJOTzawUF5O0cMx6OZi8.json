  "lyrics": "Slamming all your drinks\r\nYou don't have to think about me\r\nYou've got all your friends, used up all their meds, honey\r\nI'll still be okay when, you walk my way publicly\r\nBut when I get home, I can't be alone, can't you see?\n\nYou scare me with your indifference\n\nI like you best when you're a mess\n\n\n\nSpacing out again at your suburban retreat\n\nDid I freak you out?\n\nOh, what's that about? Tell me\n\nFrom what I can see reciprocity is boring, but I'm tired of unrequited love stories\n\n\n\n\n\nYou scare me with your indifference\n\nI like you best when you're a mess\n\n\n\nI don't even fantasize about what life would be like if I were to find a one true love, the kind they say I should be dreaming of\n\n\n\nYou say you can't get close, hurt the ones you love the most\n\nIs that why I try to win you over\n\nSinging crimson and clover?\n\n\n\nI wanna do everything\n\nMy, my, you're such a sweet thing",
