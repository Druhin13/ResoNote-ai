  "lyrics": "Wake up the white lights are calling\r\nThe weight of the world's pressing down\r\nWatch out, the skyline is falling\r\nTransmission is lost into the ground\r\nFor so long I've been hoping\r\nOne day we could run away\n\nWild eyes have gotten lost forever\n\nBut just know I'll find you anyway\n\n\n\nI've been waiting so long\n\nI was holding out\n\nUp in the dark, up in the empty bar\n\nWith broken glass in my hand\n\nWe've been bleeding out\n\nI wait before the night\n\nI wait before the night to start\n\n\n\nTill we are one\n\nSo we just stare into the sun\n\nCollect the barrel of a gun\n\nNever know, never know until we run\n\nTill we are one\n\n\n\nLost now, I've been searching\n\nWashed out, alone, city lights\n\nEach day the signal is stronger\n\nSo I know that there's still a fight\n\n\n\nI've been waiting so long\n\nI was holding out\n\nUp in the dark, up in the empty bar\n\nWith broken glass in my hand\n\nWe've been bleeding out\n\nI'm waiting for the night\n\nI'm waiting for the night to start\n\n\n\nTill we are one\n\nSo we just stare into the sun\n\nCollect the barrel of a gun\n\nNever know, never know until we run\n\nUntil we are one\n\nSo we just stare into the sun\n\nCollect the barrel of a gun\n\nNever know, never know until we run\n\nUntil we are one\n\n\n\nUntil we are one\n\nSo we just stare into the sun\n\nCollect the barrel of a gun\n\nNever know, never know until we run\n\nTill we are one\n\nTill we are one\n\nTill we are one\n\nTill we are one\n\nTill we are one\n\nTill we are one\n\nTill we are one",
