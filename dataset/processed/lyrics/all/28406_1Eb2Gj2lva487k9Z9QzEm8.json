  "lyrics": "When the bomber flew\r\nIt was '79\r\nMake no mistake\r\nIt was their time\r\nLiving fast and free\r\nThe only way to be\n\nThe world was on the street\n\nThey were the boys to beat\n\n\n\nAnd they played rock and roll\n\nThey played rock and roll\n\n\n\nThey took no sleep\n\nThe tour rolled on\n\nTo hammersmith\n\nTheir battle song\n\nEverything over the top\n\nGiving it all till you drop\n\nAdrenaline, leather and sweat\n\nNo one would ever forget\n\n\n\nThey played rock and roll\n\nThey played rock and roll\n\n\n\nDealing the ace\n\nReleasing the power\n\nThe 80's were here\n\nThis was the hour\n\nDecibels crushing your brain\n\nThe closer you get to the pain\n\nNight after night on the road\n\nFalling asleep with the sun\n\n\n\n\n\nBass like thunder\n\nDrums of steel\n\nGuitars of fury\n\nWith lightning fear\n\nLiving fast and free\n\nThe only way to be\n\nThe world was on the street\n\nThey were the boys to beat\n\n\n\nAnd they played rock and roll\n\nThey played rock and roll\n\nThey played rock and roll\n\nThey played rock and roll",
