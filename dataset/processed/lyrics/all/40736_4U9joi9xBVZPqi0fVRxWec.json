  "lyrics": "Lift up on the door on the old rusted hinge\r\nThe lock might be fickle, it's always been\r\nBut it's a sweet old place to keep our memories in\r\nThis house ain't much of a house, but it's a home\r\nEmpty cans on the counter and the laundry's never done\n\nThe dog's tracked in snow and mud\n\nFor every rose there's a weed, but every weed is welcome\n\nThis house ain't much of a house, but it's a home\n\n\n\nThe faucet might leak, the staircase might creak\n\nThe heater takes a while to kick in\n\nBut there's a whole lot of laughter and love\n\nThis house, this house is our home\n\n\n\nThere's a bed upstairs if you're ever in town\n\nOr if you need a place to get your feet back on the ground\n\nThere's coffee in the cupboard, take any food you want out\n\nMy house, my house is your home\n\n\n\nTucker's buried in the yard under that old oak we carved\n\nThat porch is where you and I first kissed\n\nAnd there's no shortage of laughter or love\n\nThis house, this house is our home\n\nThis house, this house is our home",
