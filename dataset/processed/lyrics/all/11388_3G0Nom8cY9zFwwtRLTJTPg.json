  "lyrics": "A brief encounter\r\nLike wind through the trees\r\nIt came so suddenly\r\nBut then it was gone\r\nLike it had never been\r\nHow could I have ever seen\n\nA lost heart\n\nWill take your soul\n\n\n\nHow could I have known\n\nHow could I have known\n\nAs she took me in her arms\n\nAnd brought me to an end\n\nWith the kiss of death\n\nThe kiss of death\n\n\n\nShe promised paradise\n\nAs she lied upon her bed\n\nLike a fallen angel\n\nWith the devil's charm\n\nShe promised paradise\n\nWith the kiss of death\n\n\n\nI tried to stop\n\nAs she held out her hand\n\nBut the fire was burning inside\n\nShe knew what i wanted\n\nShe gave it and more\n\nBut now I must pay the price\n\nWe were strangers\n\nPassing in the night\n\n\n\nHow could I have known\n\nHow could I have known\n\nAs she took me in her arms\n\nAnd brought me to an end\n\nWith the kiss of death\n\nThe kiss of death\n\n\n\nShe promised paradise\n\nAs she lied upon her bed\n\nLike a fallen angel\n\nWith the devil's charm\n\nShe promised paradise\n\nWith the kiss of death\n\n\n\nAs she took me in her arms\n\nI felt the devil's charm\n\nSuddenly I see\n\nThe final destiny\n\nWith the kiss of death\n\nThe kiss of death\n\n\n\nShe promised paradise\n\nAs she lied upon her bed\n\nLike a fallen angel\n\nWith the devil's charm\n\nShe promised paradise\n\nWith the kiss of death\n\n\n\nWith the kiss of death",
