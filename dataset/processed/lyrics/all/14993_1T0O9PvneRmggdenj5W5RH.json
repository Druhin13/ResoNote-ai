  "lyrics": "3 a.m., she'll call you up when she's lonely\r\nShe'll just drive, without a clue where she's goin'\r\nShe'll try to tell a joke, and get the punch line wrong\r\nForget all the words, to her own forget song\r\nAnd when she walks into the room, she'll set it alight\r\nAnd she'll always be on your side\n\n\n\nThat's just the way that she loves\n\nThat's just the way that she moves you\n\nShe'll take you higher than high\n\nBoy you can try, just know you won't ever get enough\n\nThat's just the way that she loves, woah\n\n\n\nWell she's gonna cry, before the credits start rolling\n\nShe's gonna give you her heart, woah,\n\nAnd it's gonna feel like you've stole it\n\nAh, she'll have her hair pulled back, and your t-shirt on\n\nWon't need to take a picture, darlin', cause after she's gone\n\nYeah you still remember you're gonna be\n\nThinking about her every minute all night long\n\n\n\nThat's just the way that she loves\n\nThat's just the way that she moves you\n\nShe'll take you higher than high\n\nBoy you can try, just know you won't ever get enough\n\nShe's gonna set you on fire\n\nShe's gonna light up your midnight\n\nAnd if you lose her she's always,\n\nSilhouette in the hallway, the one you can't stop thinking of\n\nThat's just the way that she loves\n\n\n\nThat's just the way that she loves\n\nThat's just the way that she moves you\n\nWell she'll take you higher than high\n\nBoy you could try, just know you won't ever get enough\n\nShe's gonna set you on fire\n\nShe's gonna light up your midnight\n\nAnd if you get to hold her, don't ever let her go\n\nShe's something like a sunset, turning everything to gold\n\nThat's just the way that she loves\n\nWoah\n\nThat's just the way that she loves\n\nYeah\n\nThat's just the way that she loves",
