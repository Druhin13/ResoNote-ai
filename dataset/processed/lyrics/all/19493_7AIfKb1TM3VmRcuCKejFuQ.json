  "lyrics": "Remember when this was nothing but being friends\r\nWe played guitar and we settled for anything\r\nPlaying to no one and breaking the bank\r\nWe pushed ourselves to the end\r\nWe never worried bout looking back\r\nWe always used to sing\n\nOur hearts together beating\n\nThe sound was deafening\n\nOur dreams a constant feeling\n\nNow, it's gone\n\n\n\nWe've gone too far\n\nWe've got to find ourselves\n\nWe've gone too far\n\nWe've got to find, ourselves\n\n\n\nSo in the end I could never remember when\n\nThis place had changed and we were no longer being friends\n\nClosing the door on the years we had made\n\nAnd the dreams we had shared were nothing more than a fading page\n\nWe built the bridges up\n\nYet we still ended burning\n\nAnd now we're giving up\n\nOur hopes rise way to early\n\n\n\nWe've gone too far\n\nWe've got to find ourselves\n\nWe've gone too far\n\nWe've got to find, ourselves\n\n\n\nAre you listening\n\nCause I still feel it calling\n\nIt's beating in our hearts\n\nSinging whoa\n\nCan you feel it sing\n\nI can see the hope rebuilding\n\nIf we can find ourselves\n\nSinging whoa\n\n\n\nAnd we're still singing\n\nWhoa\n\n\n\nWe've gone too far\n\nWe've got to find ourselves\n\nWe've gone too far\n\nWe've got to find, ourselves\n\n\n\nWe've got to find ourselves",
