MAXX, for the summer tees\n\nI remember when dunks in the dungarees\n\nAnd I got boxer-brief nigga, underneath\n\nCountin' on my name, brand clothes [?]\n\nNah I need those Gucci sneaks, at least one a piece\n\n\n\nShe's on my dick, she knows me from somewhere on TV, and she saw me on the internet\n\nI only let her give me brain, what can I say, I love her intellect\n\nShe understands that I am on the come up, and she sees the benefit\n\nShe wants to hold on tight, I say see let's go on my ways, for a better grip\n\nPlease don't, please don't\n\nTwo or no less in a threesome\n\nLet me know if you need some\n\nDrop it low unless your knees don't, er\n\n\n\nMaybe I should not be drinkin', before you ask me just how I feel\n\nMaybe I should not be drinkin', 'fore I speak my mind, that's not ideal\n\nYou're not a girlfriend, yeah I should be faithful\n\nI think of you like Wi-Fi, and I think of her like cable\n\n\n\nI met a girl on the plane, and I don't even pretend to know her name\n\nAnd I told I ain't alone in this lane\n\nAnd she told me the sex is sorta like a Novacane\n\nAnd she likes to overtrain, woah\n\nThen I told her \"Slow the lane\"\n\nThen I told her \"Baby you might wanna show restraint\"\n\nThen I told her \"Fuck it, whatchu' know, it's all the same\"\n\nYou got some shit to overcome, so I really hope you came, wait\n\nWhite lies, baby white lies\n\nThis is my time, know me well from my timeline\n\n\n\nShe's on my dick, she knows me from somewhere on TV, and she saw me on the internet\n\nI only let her give me brain, what can I say, I love her intellect\n\nShe understands that I am on the come up, and she sees the benefit\n\nShe wants to hold on tight, I say see let's go on my ways, for a better grip\n\nPlease don't, please don't\n\nTwo or no less in a threesome\n\nLet me know if you need some\n\nDrop it low unless your knees don't, er\n\n\n\nMaybe I should not be drinkin', before you ask me just how I feel\n\nMaybe I should not be drinkin', 'fore I speak my mind, that's not ideal\n\nYou're not a girlfriend, yeah I should be faithful\n\nI think of you like Wi-Fi, and I think of her like cable, woo\n\n\n\nBaby, Baby Brenda got a baby\n\nAnd you came for the A-list\n\nAnd they call a nigga wavy\n\nBaby, Baby Brenda got a baby\n\nAnd you came for the A-list\n\nAnd they call a nigga wavy",
