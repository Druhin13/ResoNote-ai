  "lyrics": "We stayed up all night watching the comedy show\r\nThat aged whiskey and hydro\r\nGood lord, what a nice conversation\r\nI'm too floored to get anywhere safely\r\nYou know I talk about you highly\r\nI'm fascinated for the time being\n\nWe can laugh until the morning\n\nOr we can dance in the hallway\n\n\n\nOnly one more night in Los Angeles\n\nI really thought I could handle\n\nBut the funny thing is, I was holding back tears\n\nI didn't think this day would happen\n\nI give all this up for a chance at it\n\nYou really thought I'd be the man for this?\n\nBut the funny thing is, we can never stay here\n\nI didn't think this day could happen\n\n\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\nRide\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\n\n\nAnd don't all this new music sound the same?\n\nYeah we must be getting old and grey\n\nWe left early, girl, that bed was sh*tty anyway\n\nWe went home and left the clothes up in the living space, aye\n\nWould you stay if your heart had the power?\n\nWould you run and find another life to imitate?\n\nIt's important that we make the best of short time\n\nYou could never be my one and only, anyway\n\nSay, can't a young man dream?\n\nCan't we all have the life on a widescreen?\n\nWhat's the point? Yeah\n\nWe had fun for the time being\n\n\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\nRide\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\n\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\n\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\nRide\n\nI'ma ride it 'til it's over\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride\n\nI'ma ride, I'ma ride",
