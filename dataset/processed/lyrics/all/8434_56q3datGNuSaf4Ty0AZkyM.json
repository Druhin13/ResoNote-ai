  "lyrics": "Somebody better come get me, cause I ain't got a lot to lose\r\nWhat I've been through, sort of distorted my views\r\nI ain't really got a clue, what I'ma do\r\nGive me the help that I need, I try and keep it in the booth\r\nBut between me and you I feel the pressure of all of it\r\nTelling me I've gotta use, what am I doing\n\nAin't got a fam, ain't got a home, ain't got a plan\n\nAin't got a single thing that I've been doing right\n\nBut I don't really think you'd understand\n\nCause on the surface, everything's perfect\n\nYeah, I've been making money, rubber bands\n\nBut I've been trying to be somebody other than me\n\nAnd I don't remember who I am\n\nI don't remember what it's like to love\n\nCause when I felt it I was young\n\nI just wrote Dominique a fucking email\n\nWhat am I doing I'm dumb\n\nI had a girl, we had a dream\n\nBut I was weak, now it is done\n\nI found out my ex was having a baby, crazy\n\nThat one left me kinda bummed\n\nShould've been mine, it should've been mine\n\nAre you out your mind, boy\n\nShe ain't thought about you in ten years\n\nShe's settled down and doing fine\n\nAnd I know I ain't gotta remind you\n\nWhat it would do to you when you would find\n\nAnother excuse to get in the noose and give her your time\n\n\n\nI know that everything I'm going through has got a reason\n\nWhen you're going through it that's all that you can believe in\n\nYou may not deserve it, no, but maybe it was needed\n\nGotta keep your head up if you really wanna beat it\n\nI know that everything I'm going through has got a reason\n\nWhen you're going through it that's all that you can believe in\n\nYou may not deserve it, no, but maybe it was needed\n\nGotta keep your head up if you really wanna beat it\n\n\n\nI been living a lie, but bringing it by though\n\nAnd I'm willing to die, for the rhythm that I know\n\nCause I don't like change, and I won't behave\n\nI got nothing but destruction on my brain\n\nAnd you might know me, or maybe not I don't give a damn\n\nI'm lonely, and I don't know how to be a different man\n\nI'm the one that made this so bad\n\nCommon sense, I been missing that\n\nIn between I need time for me\n\nAnd it's time for me to go and get you back\n\nI feel for the kids the most\n\nCause they don't really get to know\n\nWhat's going on between us both\n\nAll they see is we ain't close\n\nAll this discussion in private\n\nSuddenly I'm about to be a ghost\n\nI don't even know where to go\n\nBut tell them I love 'em when I hit the road\n\nI love you and you'll always be my best friend\n\nHere's to a new beginning, let the rest end\n\nI thank you for your love and all your lessons\n\nI will never be the same again\n\n\n\nI know that everything I'm going through has got a reason\n\nWhen you're going through it that's all that you can believe in\n\nYou may not deserve it, no, but maybe it was needed\n\nGotta keep your head up if you really wanna beat it\n\nI know that everything I'm going through has got a reason\n\nWhen you're going through it that's all that you can believe in\n\nYou may not deserve it, no, but maybe it was needed\n\nGotta keep your head up if you really wanna beat it\n\n\n\nI've been feeling all good\n\nBeen feeling all right\n\nI'm feeling all good until I'm not alright\n\nThen it gets bad for me\n\nThen when I'm tripping it gets bad for me\n\nBad for me (for me)\n\n\n\nI know that everything I'm going through has got a reason\n\nWhen you're going through it that's all that you can believe in\n\nYou may not deserve it, no, but maybe it was needed\n\nGotta keep your head up if you really wanna beat it\n\nI know that everything I'm going through has got a reason\n\nWhen you're going through it that's all that you can believe in\n\nYou may not deserve it, no, but maybe it was needed\n\nGotta keep your head up if you really wanna beat it",
