  "lyrics": "Think about our love, the times I've tried and tried\r\nTell me why\r\nIs it just a proof of how we lost the fight?\r\nWhy do you push me away when I need you the most?\r\nYou know you're all that I want\n\nAnd I can't find the joy that we've been looking for\n\nHelp me out\n\n\n\nOh, all I want from you is to make up your mind\n\nMake up your mind\n\nI'm tired of it all, so please don't waste my time\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\n\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\n\n\nI can't find the joy that we've been looking for\n\nHelp me out\n\nHard to get right back to where we were before\n\nStop the fight\n\n\n\nWhy do you push me away when I need you the most?\n\nYou know you're all that I want\n\nAnd I can't find the joy that we've been looking for\n\nHelp me out\n\n\n\nOh, all I want from you is to make up your mind\n\nMake up your mind\n\nI'm tired of it all, so please don't waste my time\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\n\n\nOh, but when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nLose you\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\n\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nI never wanna lose you\n\nBut when it all comes down\n\nI never wanna lose you",
