  "lyrics": "There's a drift wood sign at the end of the bar\r\nWith an \"X\" on a map that says \"here's where you are\"\r\nWith bright colored arrows with miles and degrees\r\nThat point to wherever home used to be\r\nWe come and we go like the tide\r\nAnd we've all got our own reasons why\n\n\n\nWe're all here\n\n'Cause where else would we go\n\nWhen the earth tips sideways\n\nIt's just where we'll roll\n\nWell that crazy train ran out of track\n\nWe all jumped off and never looked back\n\nOn a buzz, on a binge, on a dare\n\nOn a whim, on a wing, on a prayer\n\nMaybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there\n\nNaw we ain't all there\n\n\n\nAt the end of our ropes or the end of the line\n\nGot a few loose screws, got a couple too tight\n\nWe're anchors and sails, we're tattoos and scars\n\nWe've all drifted out just a little too far\n\nWe were born in this understood\n\nSo we got as fast as we could\n\n\n\nWe're all here\n\n'Cause where else would we go\n\nWhen the earth tips sideways\n\nIt's just where we'll roll\n\nWell that crazy train ran out of track\n\nWe all jumped off and never looked back\n\nOn a buzz, on a binge, on a dare\n\nOn a whim, on a wing, on a prayer\n\nYeah maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there\n\n\n\nWe ain't closin' down anytime soon\n\nIf you wanna come howl at the moon\n\nWe can always make a little more room\n\n\n\n'Cause we're all here\n\nWhere else would we go\n\nWhen the earth tips sideways\n\nIt's just where we'll roll\n\nWell that crazy train ran out of track\n\nWe all jumped off and never looked back\n\nOn a buzz, on a binge, on a dare\n\nOn a whim, on a wing, on a prayer\n\nYeah maybe we're all here, 'cause we ain't all there\n\nNaw we ain't all there",
