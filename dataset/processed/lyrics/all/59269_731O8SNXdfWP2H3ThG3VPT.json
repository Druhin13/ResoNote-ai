  "lyrics": "I found a box, ’of photographs, a couple letters and a backstage pass\r\nThe one you stole at warp tour\r\nIn a cloud of dust, you held me close, pushed our way up to the very first row\r\nFrom that moment I was all yours\r\nAnd I bet you don’t have a clue, that I’m thinking about you\n\n\n\nFirst touch, first kiss, that rush, I miss,\n\nThe way you moved me (you never forget your)\n\nFirst love, first risk, you don’t forget\n\nThe way your heart hurts\n\nYou never forget your first\n\nYou never forget your first\n\n\n\nSat on the bluffs till the sun came up\n\nTook all night just to get the guts\n\nTo whisper, I love you\n\nBut sometimes love is bittersweet\n\nAnd we were chasing different dreams\n\nI wonder where you are now\n\n\n\nAnd I bet you don’t have a clue, that I’m thinking about you\n\n\n\nFirst touch, first kiss, that rush, I miss,\n\nThe way you moved me (you never forget your)\n\nFirst love, first risk, you don’t forget\n\nThe way your heart hurts\n\nYou never forget your first\n\nYou never forget your first\n\n\n\nDon't know what you got till it’s gone, and now I don’t what to do\n\nCause this old shoebox I founds, got me thinking about you!\n\nYa I’m thinking about you\n\n\n\nFirst touch, first kiss, that rush, I miss,\n\nThe way you moved me (you never forget your)\n\nFirst love, first risk, you don’t forget\n\nThe way your heart hurts\n\nYou never forget your first\n\nYou never forget your first",
