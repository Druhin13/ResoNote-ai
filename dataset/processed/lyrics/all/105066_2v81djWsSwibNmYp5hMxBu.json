  "lyrics": "You were cynical the last time that I saw you\r\nAnd I thought that's what a real grown-up looks like\r\nYou were happy once, but that was such a long time ago now\r\nGravity took something from your light\r\nAnd I thought back to the years that we played baseball\n\nHow I tried, but I struck out so many times\n\nBut then once I hit the ball and sailed over the fence\n\nI felt my gut all fill up with pride\n\n\n\nSo take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again\n\nSo take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again\n\n\n\nAnd I dreamt about an old abandoned hospital\n\nAnd I met up with my friends to go inside\n\nWell, I left something important back in Sunnyland\n\nAnd it's something that I know I'll never find\n\n\n\nSo take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again\n\nSo take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again\n\n\n\nCan you tell me how long now 'til Winter is done?\n\nWake me up when it's over and Spring has begun\n\nGive me all your bad days, it'll be over soon\n\nJust as long as I have you\n\n\n\nSo take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again\n\nSo take me back to Sunnyland, so I can find the light again\n\nTake me back to Sunnyland\n\nTake me back to Sunnyland",
