  "lyrics": "Tell us what you're gonna do tonight, mama. \nThere must be someplace you can go \nIn the middle of the tall drinks and the drama, \nthere must be someone you know. \nGod knows, you're lookin' good enough, \n\nbut you're so smooth and the world's so rough. \n\nYou might have somethin' to loose. \n\nOh, no, pretty mama, what you gonna \n\ndo in those shoes? \n\n\n\nGot those pretty little straps around your ankles \n\nGot those shiny little chains around your heart. \n\nYou go to have your independence \n\nbut you don't know just where to start. \n\n\n\nDesperation in the singles bars \n\nan' all those jerkoffs in their fancy cars. \n\nyou can't believe your reviews. \n\n\n\nOh, no, you can't do that, \n\nonce you started wearin' those shoes \n\n\n\nThey're lookin' at you, leanin' on you \n\nTell you anything you want to hear \n\nThey give you tablets of love \n\nThey're waiting for you \n\ngot to score you \n\nhandy with a shovel and so sincere \n\nOoh, they got the kid glove \n\n\n\nYou just want someone to talk to \n\nThey just wanna get their hands on you \n\nYou get whatever you choose \n\nOh, no, you can't do that, \n\nOnce you started wearin' those shoes.",
