  "lyrics": "Born on the wrong side of the ocean\r\nWith all the tides against you\r\nYou never thought you'd be much good for anyone\r\nBut that's so far from the truth\r\nI know there's pain in your heart\n\nAnd you're covered in scars\n\nWish you could see what I do\n\n\n\n'Cause baby, everything you are\n\nIs everything I need\n\nYou're everything to me\n\nBaby, every single part\n\nIs who you're meant to be\n\n'Cause you were meant for me\n\nAnd you're everything I need\n\n\n\nYou can say I'm wrong\n\nYou can turn your back against me\n\nBut I am here to stay\n\n(I am here to stay)\n\nLike the sea\n\nShe keeps kissing the shoreline\n\nNo matter how many times he pushes her away\n\n\n\n'Cause baby, everything you are\n\nIs everything I need\n\nYou're everything to me\n\nBaby, every single part\n\nIs who you're meant to be\n\n'Cause you were meant for me\n\n\n\nAnd everything happens for a reason\n\nIt's all a blessing in disguise\n\nI used to question who I was\n\nWell now I see\n\nThe answer is in your eyes\n\n\n\n'Cause baby, everything you are\n\nIs everything I need\n\nYou're everything to me\n\nBaby, every single part\n\nIs who you're meant to be\n\n'Cause you were meant for me\n\nAnd you're everything I need",
