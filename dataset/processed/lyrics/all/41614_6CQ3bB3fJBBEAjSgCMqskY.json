  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Fraction par Alius\r\nI'm gonna tell you how I feel\nYou're oceans deep of blue, a sky that never ends\nI’m not afraid to share my all\nMy darkest and my light, all I have, I give to you\n\nSo just dive right in, into my arms\nAnd just hold my hand, you’re more than enough\n\nAll I need, is a fraction, a fraction of what your world can give\nJust a fraction, a fraction, oh\nYour world has so much love, you are more than enough\nAll I need, is a fraction, a fraction, a fraction of your love\n\n\nWe met through the telephone\nThrough a modern piece of art I could see you smile\nBut it’s the same as yesterday\nYou’re perfect in my eyes in every single way\n\nSo just dive right in, into my arms\nAnd just hold my hand, you’re more than enough\n\nAll I need, is a fraction, a fraction of what your world can give\nJust a fraction, a fraction, oh\nYour world has so much love, you are more than enough\nAll I need, is a fraction, a fraction, a fraction of your love\n\n\nA fraction of your love\nA fraction of your love\n\nAll I need, is a fraction, a fraction of what your world can give\nJust a fraction, a fraction, oh\nYour world has so much love, you are more than enough\nAll I need, is a fraction, a fraction, a fraction of your love\n\nA fraction of your love",
