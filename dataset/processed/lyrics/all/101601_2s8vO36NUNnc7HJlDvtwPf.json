  "lyrics": "Babe I know it swirls around me\r\nLike the sun shines on the coast\r\nLike a weathered, torn, once sturdy barn\r\nI used to give your shoulder and warmth\r\nIt's clear, I can see\n\nThe dry grass at my feet\n\nAs I wait to go, you'll come home and you'll say\n\n\"Baby I know\"\n\n\n\nBabe I know\n\nBaby I know\n\nThe course has drifted here\n\nAs we swim to land mouths full of the sand, just say\n\n\"Baby I know\"\n\n\n\nI'm more tired and my throats so dry\n\nI feel I'm barely holding on\n\nI'm gonna sit around here with this abscessed fear and say\n\n\"Baby I know\"\n\n\n\nNow there's something that I want that I'll never be\n\nBurned out full of love\n\nNow sometimes I lay here half awake\n\nAnd say, baby I know\n\nNow sometimes I lay here half awake\n\nAnd say, baby I know",
