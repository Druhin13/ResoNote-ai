  "lyrics": "Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong\r\nYou're enchained by your own sorrow\r\nIn your eyes, there is no hope for tomorrow\r\nHow I hate to see you like this\r\nThere is no way you can deny it\r\nI can see that you're oh-so sad, so quiet...\n\n\n\nChiquitita, tell me the truth\n\nI'm a shoulder you can cry on\n\nYour best friend, I'm the one you must rely on\n\nYou were always sure of yourself\n\nNow, I see you've broken a feather (How it hurts to see you cry and how it hurts to see you sad)\n\nI hope we can patch it up together...\n\n\n\nChiquitita, you and I know\n\nHow the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving\n\nYou'll be dancing once again, and the pain will end\n\nYou will have no time for grieving\n\nChiquitita, you and I cry\n\nBut the sun is still in the sky and shining above you\n\nLet me hear you sing once more like you did before\n\nSing a new song, Chiquitita\n\nTry once more, like you did before\n\nSing a new song, Chiquitita...\n\n\n\nSo the walls came tumbling down\n\nAnd your love's a blown-out candle\n\nAll is gone, and it seems too hard to handle\n\nChiquitita, tell me the truth\n\nThere is no way you can deny it\n\nI see that you're oh-so sad, so quiet...\n\n\n\nChiquitita, you and I know\n\nHow the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving\n\nYou'll be dancing once again, and the pain will end\n\nYou will have no time for grieving\n\nChiquitita, you and I cry\n\nBut the sun is still in the sky and shining above you\n\nLet me hear you sing once more like you did before\n\nSing a new song, Chiquitita\n\nTry once more, like you did before\n\nSing a new song, Chiquitita...",
