  "lyrics": "Love was a lighthouse guiding the way\r\nWe were two boats on the ocean\r\nFollowing shadows that led us astray\r\nCase of mistaken emotion\r\nSuddenly you've drifted back to my arms\n\nAnd while we were lost in the dark\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nLove stood still\n\nMovin' us together\n\nLove stood still\n\nLeading us towards each other\n\nNow we're back at the start\n\nCos while we were apart\n\nLove stood still\n\n\n\nLove was a fire burned down to the\n\nWaiting for something to spark\n\nWe were two fireflies drawn to the glow\n\nSinging you lit the flames in my heart\n\n\n\nI had my reasons for letting you go\n\nBut holding you again i know\n\n\n\n[repeat Chorus]\n\n\n\nNow you ask me to say\n\nI'll always feel this way\n\nNow then nothing has ever changed\n\n\n\n[repeat Chorus]",
