  "lyrics": "It's a question that I never learned to ask\r\nHow far I'd follow you into the dark\r\nYeah it's still a question that I'm too afraid to ask\r\nHow far I'd follow you, how far I'd follow you\r\nWhen she saw that I'd tattooed my hands\n\nI said mum I don't think I was ever gonna work for the bank\n\nAnd I said that I was sorry about that line\n\nI only wrote it cause it rhymed\n\n\n\nWe're not those kids sitting on the swing set\n\nAnd I will follow you across the planet\n\nIf we could take our time\n\nWe'd get it right, we'd get it right\n\n\n\nHe was so bitter when he said\n\nThey'll offer you the world but they'll leave you for dead\n\nAnd nobody tried to understand or at least act surprised\n\nWhen I said that I wasn't the one who was unfaithful\n\nThat I could see why people thought I was\n\nSometimes making love is the only time I ever feel loved\n\nThere was never any middle ground\n\n\n\nNow he sits alone in his one bedroom apartment\n\nTells himself he's happy and he made the right decisions\n\nAnd he expected that I was gonna fail and run back\n\nWell fuck that\n\n\n\nBut I'll wait for you\n\nAt the end of the earth is where I'll wait for you\n\nYou can meet me there\n\nSee I never really strayed far from here\n\n\n\nCause my head just gets so loud\n\nI can't hear the words coming out of your mouth\n\nSorry I don't react the way you want me to sometimes\n\nI only wrote it cause it rhymed\n\n\n\nYour silhouette against the fire\n\nWell I thought I saw a UFO\n\nBut it was just a lighter\n\nAnd we nearly died\n\nShit I'm still amazed how we survived\n\nProbably shouldn't let me drive",
