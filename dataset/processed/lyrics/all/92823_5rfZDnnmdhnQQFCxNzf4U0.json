  "lyrics": "And I'm sorry for never giving time you could take\r\nAnd you know I'm sorry for all of the mistakes I've made\r\nBut I don't wanna waste away (waste away)\r\nI wish I could change my ways (change my ways)\r\nBut I don't wanna waste away (waste away)\n\nI wish I could change my ways (change my ways)\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away the days I take\n\nWanna take away mistakes I've made\n\nDon't wanna waste away the days I take\n\nWanna take away mistakes I've made\n\n\n\nDon't wanna waste away, you know I hate the pain\n\nWake up every morning with nobody by my side\n\nThinking that's how imma die\n\nSpending racks on therapy for peace of mind\n\nMilligrams of anti-anxiety, what I am prescribed\n\nFeelin' like I'm gonna die\n\nFeelin' like I'm on a ride that never ends\n\nHella drop I got no friends, swear this ride just never ends\n\nLock myself up in my room so I'm not stressed\n\nBut I'm always by myself, that is the reason I'm depressed\n\nThat's the reason I don't like to talk to friends\n\nI don't wanna bring the mood down, and make them all resent\n\nSo I keep it bottled up until the bottle finally shakes\n\nMy world finally crashes down, cause this life has no breaks, yuh\n\n\n\nAnd I'm sorry for never giving time you could take\n\nAnd you know I'm sorry for all of the mistakes I've made\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away (waste away)\n\nI wish I could change my ways (change my ways)\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away (waste away)\n\nI wish I could change my ways (change my ways)\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away the days I take\n\nWanna take away mistakes I've made\n\nDon't wanna waste away the days I take\n\nWanna take away mistakes I've made, no\n\n\n\nFeeling like the ash on my cigarette (falling)\n\nSpending all my time on the internet (all in)\n\nTrying to forget about your silhouette (often)\n\nDon't know what to do, I think I'm in a mess (lost it)\n\nI wish things were back like in the summertime (diving)\n\nRunning got me feeling like another time (running)\n\nBack when I was broken cause she wasn't mine (fuck it)\n\nBack when I was always on the other side\n\n\n\nAnd I'm sorry for never giving time you could take\n\nAnd you know I'm sorry for all of the mistakes I've made\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away (waste away)\n\nI wish I could change my ways (change my ways)\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away (waste away)\n\nI wish I could change my ways (change my ways)\n\nBut I don't wanna waste away the days I take\n\nWanna take away mistakes I've made\n\nDon't wanna waste away the days I take\n\nWanna take away mistakes I've made, no",
