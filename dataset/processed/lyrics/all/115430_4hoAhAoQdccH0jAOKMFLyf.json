  "lyrics": "I like to dance under street lamps and walk upon the clouds\r\nI like to shout from the rooftops and surf on top of the crowd\r\n(Oh oh oh, oh oh)\r\nFor many years, many years I was scared of the person I was\r\nAnd I'm not perfect they say, but I know that I was born to be loved\r\n(Oh oh oh, oh oh)\n\n\n\nHey hey hey, will they love me now?\n\n\n\nHey now kid, you're my salvation!\n\nJust put it all out, don't let your head down\n\nAll my life they never told me\n\nThey never said that it'd be so hard\n\n\n\nI like to spend all my money on things that I don't need\n\nI like to sleep all the day 'cause this life is easier in dream\n\n(Oh oh oh, oh oh)\n\nYeah in my dreams, in my dreams well I think about the places I have been\n\nAnd I can't regret what I have done, it's the past that makes me who I am\n\n(Oh oh oh, oh oh)\n\n\n\nHey hey hey, will they love me now?\n\n\n\nHey now kid, you're my salvation!\n\nJust put it all out, don't let your head down\n\nAll my life they never told me\n\nThey never said that it'd be so hard\n\n\n\nEven when the sun goes down\n\nI'll be there to hold and love you\n\nEven when the day is done\n\nI will be the one you can run to\n\nEven when I'm dead and gone\n\nI will always watch out for you\n\nNow until the day we meet again\n\nUntil we meet again\n\n\n\nHey now kid, you're my salvation!\n\nJust put it all out, don't let your head down\n\nAll my life they never told me\n\nThey never said that it'd be so hard\n\nThey never said that it'd be so hard",
