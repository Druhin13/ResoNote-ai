  "lyrics": "I pour my heart out, three minutes at a time\r\nOn a J-45, but no one's listening\r\nThey're too busy drinking on the company tab\r\nI scream my lungs out, confess my secrets, all my sins\r\nBut they don't give a damn\r\nCause if it don't sound like the radio? Pass\n\n\n\nNashville, you win\n\nYour still guitars and broken hearts have done me in\n\nI gave you my soul, 'cause I wanted it so bad\n\nAnd now I just wanna go home\n\nThis town is killing me\n\nThis town is killing me\n\n\n\nThey buried my grandad without me\n\nCause I was out on the road at some one off show\n\nIn Tubalo, and I can't take that one back\n\nI was in love once and I pushed him away\n\nAnd the price I pay is a whole lot of lonely nights\n\nAnd a whole lot of songs that never see the light\n\n\n\nNashville, you win\n\nYour still guitars and broken hearts have done me in\n\nI gave you my soul, 'cause I wanted it so bad\n\nAnd now I just wanna go home\n\nThis town is killing me\n\nThis town is killing me\n\nOh this town is killing\n\nThis town is killing me\n\n\n\nNashville, you win\n\nCause I'll wake up here tomorrow, do it all over again\n\nEven though you're killing me\n\nOh, this town is killing me\n\nThis town is killing me",
