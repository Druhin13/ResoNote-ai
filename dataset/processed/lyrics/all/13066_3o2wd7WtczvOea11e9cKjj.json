  "lyrics": "Love, it seems like only yesterday, you were just a child at play\r\nNow you’re all grown up beside of me\r\nOh how fast those moments flee\r\nOnce we watched a lazy world go by, now those days seem to fly\r\nLife is brief, but when it’s gone\n\nLove goes on and on\n\nLove will win, love will last, love will learn\n\nOnce we watched a lazy world go by, now those days seem to fly\n\nLife is brief, but when it’s gone\n\nLove goes on and on",
