  "lyrics": "She'll take you in, feed your friends\r\nHer open arms are welcoming\r\nShe'll rub your back all night when you're crying\r\nShe'll listen to you tell your story\r\nHold your fear and all your worries\r\nHelp you find the truth when they're all lying\n\nEven when it's hopeless, she keeps trying\n\n\n\nShe's your mother, you love her\n\nThere won't be another place like her again that you call home\n\nShe stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do\n\nAs long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other\n\nThat's your mother\n\n\n\nShe fixes all the broken things\n\nWhen you're in love, she's got a ring\n\nTo give to you, she hopes you'll give away\n\nShe don't care who you give it to\n\nWhere they're from, if they pray like you\n\nAs long as they are good to you, that's enough\n\nFirst thing she taught you was love is love\n\n\n\nShe's your mother, you love her\n\nThere won't be another place like her again that you call home\n\nShe stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do\n\nAs long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other\n\nThat's your mother\n\n\n\nWhen you fail her, when you're afraid\n\nAnd crying in the careless mess you've made\n\nShe'll make you clean it up yourself and offer you a little help\n\nAnd dry your weary eyes when you let her\n\nBut she'll look at you and know you can do better\n\n\n\nShe's your mother, you love her\n\nThere won't be another place like her again that you call home\n\nShe stands here to help you, there's nothing she won't do\n\nAs long as she's alive, you're not alone, you've got each other\n\nAnd the secrets in your heart she's always known\n\n\n\nShe's a beacon, a harbour\n\nA lighthouse, her armour\n\nA promise and a blanket when it's cold\n\nYou'll understand it more when you get older\n\nYou've got each other\n\nThat's your mother\n\nYou've got each other\n\nThat's your mother",
