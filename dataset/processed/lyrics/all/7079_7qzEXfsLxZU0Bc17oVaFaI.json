  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Stallion par The Garden\r\nThey always say\nWhen you die\nYou'll meet god\nHe'll give you wings to fly\n\nThe more and more I let it go\nTurn the pages - sinking low\nSomeone's looking out for me\nChained me to the kitchen sink\nI can see, all I need\nReach for it, find a key\n\nAhh man\nStallion walking on my back\nI raised it from birth\nNever holding back\n\n\nNot one moment\nI don't inquire\nNow I'm weary\nHide from the fire\n\nIt's almost like\nI'm an expert\nTrap myself\nUnder a feather",
