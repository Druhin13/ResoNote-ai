  "lyrics": "Pretty soon you have to deal\r\nWith the truth behind the way you feel\r\nAnd I'd rather never know\r\nI would do anything, anything\r\nNot to bring who I am to meet me\r\nThis useless suffering\n\nUgly part of me is screwing me\n\nAs it feeds me\n\n\n\nBut it is what it is\n\nYou don't know how to live with what it is\n\nBut it is what it is\n\nIt may seem impossible\n\nBut I will embrace who I really am\n\nIf it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid\n\nThen that's what it is\n\n\n\nPretty soon you'll have to face\n\nYou're a virus called the human race\n\nAnd I'll never, never know\n\nI have done everything, everything\n\nNot to feel what it is I'm feeling\n\nThis basement devil is kicking the ass\n\nOf my angel on the ceiling\n\n\n\nBut it is what it is\n\nYou don't know how to live with what it is\n\nBut it is what it is\n\nIt may seem impossible\n\nBut I will embrace who I really am\n\nIf it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid\n\nThen that's what it is\n\n\n\nDon't push me, don't kill me\n\nWhat it is 'cause it is what it is\n\nDon't play games, don't mess with\n\nWhat it is 'cause it is what it is\n\nDon't ask me, don't tell me\n\nWhat it is 'cause it is what it is\n\nDon't push me, don't kill me\n\nWhat it is 'cause it is what it is\n\nDon't run from where you come from\n\n'Cause it is what it is\n\nAnd I, I\n\n\n\nBut it is what it is\n\nYou don't know how to live with what it is\n\nBut it is what it is\n\nIt may seem impossible\n\nBut I will embrace who I really am\n\nIf it's a son of a bitch or a terrified kid\n\nThen that's what it is",
