  "lyrics": "The bottom feeder, God believers\r\nCan't foresee winning, but quitting isn't an option either\r\nWe spit the mantra that Nas delivered the ROC on \"Ether\"\r\nI. WILL. NOT. LOSE\r\nSick grin while I sip gin from a goblet, see your\r\nHoly Grail runneth over with what I've been bleeding\n\nPoison melody, aim and poise steadily\n\nPedigree of the Kennedys; bad luck and destiny\n\nSee the peasantry seek hope in serenity\n\nFind heaven in chemistry, unplanned pregnancy\n\nMinds caught in zealotry, unlimited weaponry\n\nLower than leprosy, star struck by celebrity\n\nNo longevity, no story or legacy\n\nErase the future with death the only penalty\n\nNo identity, trapped in the hegemony\n\nTurn neighbors to enemies, repeat the elegy\n\n\n\nAnd we got nothing\n\nWaiting on our meal ticket like, fuck it\n\nTill the day we die, our shoulders holding up that sky\n\nAnd we don't budge and we don't flinch\n\nAnd we don't shrug, not a single inch\n\nTill the day we die\n\nOur shoulders holding up that sky\n\n\n\nThey acting like they got the world on their shoulders\n\nLooking at us like we're earners or soldiers\n\nFill up their banks or go fill up their tanks\n\nGreed, money and death they instill in their ranks\n\nBut soon enough their little \"burden\" is over\n\nPeople are learning slow, their co-word isn't covert\n\nNot hard to decipher, not murdering Dozers\n\nPeople are waking up the birds and the Folgers\n\nHighly classified and preserved in a folder\n\nOnly to be exposed when the world's turning over\n\nSeems like the world's doing homework\n\nThe rich have spent a hundred years digging their own dirt\n\nAnd we're almost to six feet, critical mass\n\nPitiful let's pickle the pigs feet\n\nFeet to the fire so the fire can burn\n\nThe water's dirty, we fight fire with fire returned\n\n\n\nAnd we got nothing\n\nWaiting on our meal ticket like, fuck it\n\nTill the day we die, our shoulders holding up that sky\n\nAnd we don't budge and we don't flinch\n\nAnd we don't shrug, not a single inch\n\nTill the day we die\n\nOur shoulders holding up that sky\n\n\n\nAre you seriously surprised by the poverty?\n\nBy default, survivors we gotta be\n\nFuck classism we defy the propriety\n\nUse hierarchy to divide the society\n\nLike instead of property we get pollyseeds\n\nSchool of hard-knocks, while they get Ivy League\n\nWe get commissary, they get college fees\n\nSo logically I went on a robbing spree\n\nObviously, I was jacking for freedom\n\nActing a heathen, trapped in a mentality\n\nThat was backwards, the reason\n\nInstead of leaving the neighborhood\n\nWe thought we owned, but was only leasing\n\nI would grow to believe in:\n\nNot waiting on a mule or no acres\n\nNo patience for liberations, reparations, a better nation\n\nTruthfully it's a struggle but I admit I'm\n\nAccustomed to my condition, suffering from tradition\n\nStill...\n\n\n\nAnd we got nothing\n\nWaiting on our meal ticket like, fuck it\n\nTill the day we die, our shoulders holding up that sky\n\nAnd we don't budge and we don't flinch\n\nAnd we don't shrug, not a single inch\n\nTill the day we die\n\nOur shoulders holding up that sky",
