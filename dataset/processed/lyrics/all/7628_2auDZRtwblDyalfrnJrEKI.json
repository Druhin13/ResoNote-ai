I'm moving forward\r\nI might slip up on my ass, but I never fold up\r\nI might pull up late to class, but I always show up\n\nYeah even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\nAnd even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\n\n\nAnd I know, I know, I know I'm a mess\n\nI don' made a mess now\n\nCaught me slippin on the right\n\nWhippin from the left now\n\nI been all up off my game\n\nYoung, dumb and stressed out\n\nMight not hit a triple-double\n\nBut I put my best out\n\n\n\nYeah even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\nAnd even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\n\n\nAnd I know, I know, I know how it goes\n\nI need to work on my soul (Soul)\n\nI need to work on my goals (Goals)\n\nI need to balance my patience\n\nWork on my pace and empty my woes (Ya)\n\nI need to feel my emotions (Ya)\n\nI need a grip on my focus (Ya)\n\nI need to know what I've chose is not just for me\n\nAnd nurture my closest (Ya)\n\nI need to work with my father\n\nToo many curses I harbor\n\nI need a break from my habits\n\nCleanse of my spirit\n\nFill up my chalice (Woo)\n\nI need to know what I offer\n\nShow me a way to go farther\n\nPeace of mind [piece of mine], it's gon' cost and\n\n\n\nAnd I've been fuckin' up for a quite a while\n\nDon't know how to hide it\n\nI've been dealin' with some problems by myself in silence\n\nI ain't always at my best\n\nEven when I'm smillin'\n\nI might lose it under stress\n\nBut I always find it\n\n\n\nYeah, even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\nAnd even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\n\n\nAnd time, and time, and time, and time, and time\n\nAnd time again, I gotta turn around and tell myself\n\nLife's too short for the cards I dealt to decide my health\n\nThe mind might help when the spine might jelq from the limelight, welp\n\nWill I lose sight? Only time might tell\n\nDoes anybody feel lost on the planet?\n\nPeel back layers to my soul like, hol' up\n\nI pray for the days when the new Wayne tapes had me on ketchup mayonnaise don cannon\n\nAin't no ceilings\n\n'Ye was killing\n\n'09 Drake had me in my feelings\n\nBefore 4:44, Hov made millions\n\nNumber one off Empire State Building\n\nA state of bliss coming in the air, no Phil &'\n\nIf I ever had a doubt, momentum killed it\n\nAnd you can have all that you want\n\nHeaven or Hell?\n\nChoices on choices (Ya)\n\nVoices on voices (Ya)\n\nTeeter totter through the piece & drama\n\nFeed & water spirit while my ego wonders\n\nI be chill pillin' yet I'm hardly somber\n\nCaught between the Art of War and Dalai Lama (Woo)\n\nI need an end to my ways\n\nI need an end to my ways\n\nYea, uh, this ain't the ending of days\n\nThis is a pivotal page\n\nDecisions on decisions\n\nAm I a vessel of truth\n\nOr as crooked as any politician?\n\nI'm from where niggas don't have a pot to piss in\n\nMama's in the kitchen\n\nRent is no forgiveness\n\nReeboks on the extensions\n\nWe got good intentions\n\nCircumstances changing\n\nDevil's start to clenchin'\n\nToe-to-toe with demons\n\nAngels on the benches\n\n30 on the clock\n\nClutching through the trenches\n\nWhich side, which side?\n\nI could be lost, delivered, deprived\n\nSever my ties, decide to be blind\n\nOr open my eyes, yea\n\n\n\nYeah even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\n\nAnd even when it's dark outside (Whoa, whoa, whoa)",
