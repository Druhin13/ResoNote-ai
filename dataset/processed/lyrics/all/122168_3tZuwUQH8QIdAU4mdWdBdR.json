  "lyrics": "I could have just held my tongue\r\nI should have just filled my lungs\r\nBreathe in, breathe out and repeat\r\nBut you know me well, or at least in as far as I can tell\r\nYou should have known better than telling me I should have\r\nHeld it together for us, when I’m barely together myself\n\nI’m barely together myself\n\n\n\nI’m overthinking, everything I say and I do\n\nJust reminds me I don’t need you\n\n'Cause there’s nothing left for me to hang on to\n\n\n\nWell, if you had kept your word\n\nAnd listened instead of just heard\n\nInstead of just waiting for your turn to speak\n\nThen you’d know I was weak, but you don’t\n\nNo wonder reality hurts\n\nNo wonder reality hurts\n\n\n\nI’m overthinking, everything I say and I do\n\nJust reminds me I don’t need you\n\n'Cause there’s nothing left for me to hang on to\n\nI’m overthinking, everything I say and I do\n\nJust reminds me I don’t need you\n\n'Cause there’s nothing left for me to hang on to\n\n\n\nI’m beating myself black and blue\n\nI’m beating myself black and blue\n\nI’m beating myself black and blue\n\n(I’m beating myself black and blue)\n\n\n\nI’m overthinking, everything I say and I do\n\nJust reminds me I don’t need you\n\n'Cause there’s nothing left for me to hang on to\n\nI’m overthinking and I’m done with feeling empty\n\nAnd pretending like you get me, I’m overthinking\n\nIf I’m through, then I’m beating myself black and blue\n\nBut it won’t make no difference to you\n\n\n\nI’m beating myself black and blue\n\nI’m beating myself black and blue\n\nI’m beating myself black and blue\n\nIt won't make no difference to you",
