  "lyrics": "I was born out back\r\nBehind the chicken shack\r\nI was raised in a cardboard box\r\nAnd before when I was single\r\nI used to hear the chicken jingle\r\nThat's how I learned the chicken rock\n\nWhen I'm in the mood, dude\n\nI get some nuggets and stuff\n\nAnd head on down to the fights\n\nI'm rolling in my wheelchair\n\nZipping down the hill\n\nI'm screaming out \"chicken\"\n\nIn the middle of the night\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nOoh ooh, ooh ooh\n\nChicken makes me feel so good [x4]\n\n\n\nWhen I first met my baby\n\nI was sipping chicken gravy\n\nAnd I thought I had to close up shop\n\n(Weee pang!)\n\nNow were wedding in a chapel\n\nEating chicken, drinking Snapple\n\nOur chicken love you just can't stop\n\nWhen I'm done a working\n\nA sweating and a jerking,\n\nAnd the bossman comes and tells me when\n\nI'm going home to baby\n\nGot my chicken, got my gravy\n\nAnd we do the chicken dance again\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nDo the popcorn chicken\n\n(Do the popcorn chicken)\n\nDo the K-F-C\n\n(Do the K-F-C)\n\nDo the buffalo wing\n\n(Do the buffalo wing)\n\nDo the pioneer\n\n(Do the pioneer)\n\nCan you dig it?\n\nWe got the chicken!\n\nCut it up, cut it up, cut it up\n\nWe got some chicken guts\n\nIn a chicken cup!\n\n\n\nI'm a chicken ma-chine!!!\n\n[x4]\n\n\n\nRoscoe's\n\nWe got the chicken!\n\nGoldenbasket\n\nWe got the chicken!\n\nPopeye's\n\nWe got the chicken!\n\nPappy Parker's\n\nWe got the chicken!.\n\n\n\n[Chorus]",
