  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson A Message For Myself par The Garden\r\nGenerally I am a pretty happy person\nNot a lot to say in that department\nBut if I had a lot to say\nYou probably would've heard it already\nI'm driven to drive fast and get it done\nAnd so are my counter parts\nIt's all about putting yourself\nIn people's shoes, you know?\nI wanna go fast but I can't go too fast\nAlmost like I'm driving on black ice\nI've gotta be careful\nOr else I'll slip and fall all the way down\n\nKeep in mind try not to hide\nEveryone looks deep inside\n\n\nPlenty of people living in this world\nYeah you get what you envision living in the west\nWon't take freedom like medicine\nYeah I take it as a gift I had nothing to do with\n\nTake me to a place just like this\nWith loved ones experience bliss, yeah\n\nFear is like a sickness, yeah - you can't jog away\nAfraid of what you've never seen but heard it isn't great\nNow we're on the best one, can't take this shit away\nDon't take a life for pocket change or skies are turning grey\n\nA lot of the time when you fall down\n\nThere is someone who can pick you back up\nAnd help you get back on your feet\nIn my life right now I have that\nAnd that makes me a lucky person\n\nSome people don't have that\nAnd it makes me wonder how the world works\nPeople can't always have ideal situations\nServed on a silver platter\nAnd others have to fight harder\nI guess it all depends on how hard you fight\nMaybe you're being punished for your past life\nWhatever the case is, I definitely feel for you\nBecause in the end, everyone has problems\nAnd life tries to teach you something\nNo matter how many times you've lived\nSo keep in mind that everyone is equal\nNothing you do makes you more human than anyone else\n\n\nEnd of the day, [?]\nThis [?] world that we share\n\nPlenty of people living in this world\nYeah you get what you envision living in the west\nWon't take freedom like medicine\nYeah I take it as a gift I had nothing to do with\n\nFear for [?], fear of life\nTill the day I [?] die, yeah\n\nFear is like a sickness, yeah - you can't jog away\nAfraid of what you've never seen but heard it isn't great\nNow we're on the best one, can't take this shit away\n\nDon't take a life for pocket change or skies are turning grey",
