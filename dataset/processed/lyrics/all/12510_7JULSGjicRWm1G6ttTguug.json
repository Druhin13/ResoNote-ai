  "lyrics": "Fast car and slicked back hair\r\nHundred miles going anywhere\r\nI know I'm different that's what they say\r\nI'd give it all just to feel the same\r\nI was running now I'm drowning\r\nWhat's my fuckin' name?\r\nI've been dancing with the devil\r\nAs the music's played\r\nBut I can't hear the music till I see her face\r\nTill I see her face\r\nHello again my dear\r\nIt's only been a year\r\nAnd I wish you were here\r\nWish you were here\n\nI know this can't be right\r\nRunning toward the dead of night\r\nIn my shoes I know what you'd say\r\nTurn around and face the light of day\r\nI was hiding from myself\r\nWhat a fucking shame\r\nAnd the devil left me stranded\r\nWhen I called his name\r\nNothing hit me harder till I saw her face\r\nTill I saw her face\r\nHello again my dear\r\nIt's only been a year\r\nAnd I wish you were here\r\nWish you were here\r\nâ™ª\r\nWindows down now I can breathe\r\nAnd make sense of everything\r\nI can see the moment it went wrong\r\nI'll rewind, replay and pause\r\nI'll keep you there\r\nInside my arms\r\nHello again my dear\r\nIt's only been a year\r\nAnd I wish you were here\r\nWish you were here\r\nHello again my dear\r\nIt's only been a year\r\nAnd I wish you were here\r\nWish you were here\r\nHello again my dear\r\nIt's only been a year\r\nAnd I wish you were here\r\nWish you were here\r\nWish you were here",
