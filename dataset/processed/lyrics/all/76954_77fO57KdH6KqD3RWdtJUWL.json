  "lyrics": "Sometimes when the sun sets I feel alone\r\nSometimes I feel at home\r\nThis time, tonight, I need someone\r\nAnd it's not the sand in my hair\r\nIt's the thoughts running through my head\r\nAll those things you never said\n\n\n\nI'm on the last train home\n\nAnd you call my phone\n\nTo say I love you is too strong\n\nBut you are all I want\n\n\n\nI'm on the last train home\n\nAnd you call my phone\n\nTo say I love you is too strong\n\nBut you are all i want\n\nYeah, you are all i want\n\n\n\nWhen the sight of the ocean isn't enough\n\nAnd the pressure on your lungs is just too much\n\nThink of what you've got\n\nAnd it's not the salt on your skin\n\nIt's me, I'm tired of running\n\nYou jump in but I won't swim\n\nAnd I can't save you\n\n\n\nI'm on the last train home\n\nAnd you call my phone\n\nTo say I love you is too strong\n\nBut you are all I want\n\nYeah, you are all i want\n\n\n\nI'm on the last train home\n\nAnd you call my phone\n\nTo say I love you is too strong\n\nBut you are all I want\n\nYeah, you are all i want",
