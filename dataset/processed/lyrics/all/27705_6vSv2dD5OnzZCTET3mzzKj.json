YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me at the lounge? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me at the club? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me downtown? Okay!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me in the east? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me in the west? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me on the block? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me at the spot? Okay!\n\n\n\nI think that I'll keep loving you, way past sixty-five\n\nWe made a language for us two, we don't need to describe\n\nEverytime time you call on me, I drop what I do\n\nYou are my best friend and we've got some shit to shoot\n\n\n\nThat's the way it is\n\nThat's the way it goes\n\nIt's just us two, it's deja-vu, it's what we know\n\nThat's the way we like it, don't complicate\n\nNo need to fight it, just invite it\n\nYea-a-ah\n\n\n\n\"Datte bare-bare\" we're in love\n\nAin't nobody loved me like you've done\n\nI might have first \"dai ren'ai kitto saisho de saigo\" in my life\n\nAlisa from Tokyo\n\nI'm so addictive like some Pok√©mon\n\n\"Aimai nante iranai nai\"\n\nLike \"ichi ni san de\" bye bye bye\n\n\n\nWanna be my new friend? We got a lot in common\n\nWe can talk 'bout nothin', shoot the shit, we got shit to shoot\n\n\n\nYo, you wanna meet me at the bar? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me at the lounge? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me at the club? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me downtown? Okay!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me in the east? YAWP!\n\nYo, you wanna meet me in the west?
