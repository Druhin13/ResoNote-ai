  "lyrics": "The love of your life\r\nHe's treating you wrong\r\nYou stand by his side\r\nHe lies all along\r\nIt's the fairytale you want\n\nBut the glimmer in your eyes have gone\n\nAnd now you're alone, I'll lend you my shoulder to cry on\n\n\n\nI won't let you down, this time around\n\nI'll show you how, oh, no matter how far\n\nI don't care where you are, I won't let you down\n\n\n\nThanks for the tears, the pain that you caused her\n\nAnd now you're just a memory\n\nAn old familiar melody, she's heard before\n\n\n\nIt's a fairytale you ended\n\nDone with your pretending, you're the fool\n\nOh, you're the fool\n\nAnd now she's alone, I'll give her my hand to hold on to\n\n\n\nI won't let you down, this time around\n\nAnd I'll show you how, oh, no matter how far\n\nI don't care where you are, and I won't let you down\n\n\n\nAnd I see it now, my eyes are open\n\nI'm all yours, tears have spoken\n\nI can't fix all that is broken\n\nMy feet on the ground\n\nBut I won't let you down, this time around\n\nAnd I'll show you how, oh, and no matter how far\n\n\n\nBut I won't let you down, this time around\n\nAnd I'll show you how, oh, no matter how far\n\nI don't care where you are, I won't let you down",
