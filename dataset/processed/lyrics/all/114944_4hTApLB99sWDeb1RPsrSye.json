  "lyrics": "Over on the corner of Sunset and Doheny\r\nUp the stairs and on the rocks\r\nThat's just where she left me waiting...\r\nWaiting, so she could get high (high, high, high, high)\r\nShe doesn't do it often, only every weekend\r\nSometimes on a Tuesday, she don't really feel like sleeping...\n\nSleeping, through the night (high, high, high, high)\n\n\n\nSpending all my money just to make you feel pretty\n\nThe sky ran out of stars, they're all living in the city\n\nDon't wanna be nameless for life\n\nYou wanna be famous? That's fine\n\nSpending all my money just to make you feel pretty\n\n\n\nYou sound like you're from London, I know you're from Ohio\n\nWhat have I been drinking? What the fuck do I know?\n\nLately, lately I'm out of my mind (high, high, high, high)\n\nOh, I could use a Xanax, maybe that'll fix this\n\nShe's like an addiction, something I ain't kickin' easy, easy\n\nAm I wasting my time? (high, high, high, high)\n\n\n\nSpending all my money just to make you feel pretty\n\nThe sky ran out of stars, they're all living in the city\n\nDon't wanna be nameless for life\n\nYou wanna be famous? That's fine\n\nSpending all my money just to make you feel pretty\n\n\n\nOh my God, my life is such a mess\n\nOh my God, I think that I need some rest\n\n\n\nShe moved in my apartment, now I don't sleep often\n\nDrinking this concoction, have I really lost it?\n\nMaybe, maybe I'm out of my mind\n\n\n\nSpending all my money just to make you feel pretty\n\nThe sky ran out of stars, they're all living in the city\n\nDon't wanna be nameless for life\n\nYou wanna be famous? That's fine\n\nSpending all my money just to make you feel pretty\n\n\n\nDon't wanna be nameless for life\n\nYou wanna be famous? That's fine\n\nI'm spending all my money just to make you feel pretty",
