  "lyrics": "I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can\r\nTurn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands\r\nI believe we gotta forgive and make amends\r\n'Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends\r\nI believe in working hard for what you've got\r\nEven if it don't add up to a hell of a lot\n\n\n\nI believe most people are good\n\nAnd most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood\n\nI believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights\n\nI believe you love who you love\n\nAin't nothing you should ever be ashamed of\n\nI believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks\n\nI believe most people are good\n\n\n\nI believe them streets of gold are worth the work\n\nBut I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt\n\nI believe that youth is spent well on the young\n\n'Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun\n\nI believe if you just go by the nightly news\n\nYour faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose\n\n\n\nI believe most people are good\n\nAnd most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood\n\nI believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights\n\nI believe you love who you love\n\nAin't nothing you should ever be ashamed of\n\nI believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks\n\nI believe most people are good\n\n\n\nI believe that days go slow and years go fast\n\nAnd every breath's a gift, the first one to the last\n\n\n\nI believe most people are good\n\nAnd most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood\n\nI believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights\n\nI believe you love who you love\n\nAin't nothing you should ever be ashamed of\n\nI believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks\n\nI believe most people are good\n\n\n\nI believe most people are good\n\nI believe most people are good",
