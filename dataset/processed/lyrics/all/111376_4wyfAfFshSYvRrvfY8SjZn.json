  "lyrics": "I fell in love with an angioplast\r\nBlowin' out my insides, lettin' things pass\r\nHe doesn't know just how long it will last\r\nBut I finally feel my wall startin' to crack\r\n'Cause everyone feels it sometimes\n\nAnd everyone needs it if you wanna stay alive\n\n\n\nI can't get enough of my angioplast\n\n'Cause he knows how to make me flow so easy and fast\n\nFrom the inside of his hospital mess\n\nHe whispers, \"Baby, all you gotta do is relax\"\n\n\n\n'Cause everyone feels it sometimes\n\nAnd everyone needs it if you wanna stay alive\n\nAnd I finally feel I want to survive\n\nAs long as I long for you by my side\n\n\n\nWe let it go with a [?] blast\n\n[?] feel the power of the blood runnin' fast\n\nAs it poured out my whole memory flashed\n\nBut I'd never trade this moment for all my past\n\n\n\nYeah everyone needs it sometimes\n\nAnd everyone knows this, no guarantee that you'll survive\n\nNow I finally feel I'm ready to die\n\nAs long as I long for you by my side",
