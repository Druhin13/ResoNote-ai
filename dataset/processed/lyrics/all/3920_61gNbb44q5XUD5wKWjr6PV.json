  "lyrics": "You're gone and all that's left are the pieces\r\nYou left me without any reason to put them together\r\nNow that you're never coming back\r\nAll I have is the soul inside\r\nCause I never got to tell you goodbye\r\nWell I wanted to my life for you, for you\n\n\n\nHow can I survive without you by my side?\n\n\n\nI know I need to move on\n\nIt all feels so wrong\n\nI left you alone, I'm not ready to let go\n\nCause everyday I still see your face\n\nI never thought it would be this way\n\nI'm still holding on to the world I used to know\n\nI'm not ready to let go\n\n\n\nThis pain will never go away\n\nAnd I will never be the same\n\nCan't you see this misery is killing me\n\nIs there a way we can hit rewind\n\nTurn back the pages, go back in time\n\nCause I couldn't save you\n\nIt's always on my mind, my mind\n\n\n\nHow can I survive without you by my side?\n\n\n\nI know I need to move on\n\nIt all feels so wrong\n\nI left you alone, I'm not ready to let go\n\nCause everyday I still see your face\n\nI never thought it would be this way\n\nI'm still holding on to the world I used to know\n\nI'm not ready to let go\n\n\n\nI would bring the heavens out to find you\n\nI can't live another day without you\n\nSo many things I need to say\n\nBut now it's too late\n\n\n\nI know I need to move on\n\nIt all feels so wrong\n\nI left you alone, I'm not ready to let go\n\nCause everyday I still see your face\n\nI never thought it would be this way\n\nI'm still holding on to the world I used to know\n\nI'm not ready to let go\n\n(I'm not ready to let go)",
