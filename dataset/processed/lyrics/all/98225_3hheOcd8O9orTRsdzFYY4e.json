  "lyrics": "There's a dusty hat up on the dash of every truck you meet\r\nCountry roads and fenceposts as far as you can see\r\nBillboard sign says, \"Rodeo, June eleven through thirteen\"\r\nWhen you get to town just look around for the Rusty Nail Cafe\r\nWhere the old hands sip their coffee and relive their glory days\r\nA modern day Charlie Russell scene\n\nWhere cowboys are king\n\n\n\nI get back there every now and then\n\nTurn a few steers and rope and pen\n\nJust a couple of days and I'm gone again\n\nChasin' this old six string\n\nOh, but I sure love to be\n\nWhere cowboys are king\n\n\n\nRuns the horses down, turn 'em out, head over to the bar\n\nThere'll be George Strait on the jukebox, and I'll bet the chances are\n\nThere'll be some cowgirls in well-worn jeans\n\nWhere cowboys are king\n\n\n\nI get back there every now and then\n\nTurn a few steers and rope and pen\n\nJust a couple of days and I'm gone again\n\nChasin' this old six string\n\nOh, but I sure love to be\n\nWhere cowboys are king\n\n\n\nBoys, as bad as I wish I could stay\n\nI just hope this never goes away\n\n\n\nSo I can get back here every now and then\n\nTurn a few steers in the rope and pen\n\nSpend a little time with some good old friends\n\nY'all make it so hard to leave\n\nOh, but I sure love to be\n\nWhere cowboys are king\n\nOh, and I sure love to be\n\nWhere cowboys are king",
