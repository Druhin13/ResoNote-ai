  "lyrics": "I went through this door\r\nFor no other reason\r\nWhen it wasn't open\r\nAnd sometimes I'm foolish enough to believe encouraging things\r\nBut most times I'm cautiously less optimistic\r\nA face in the crowd\n\nI wish to be found\n\nI worry so often for those who escape\n\nI wonder out loud\n\nI sleep at odd hours\n\nAnd I write 'cause I never know just what to say\n\n\n\nMy friends all believe me\n\nWhen I say I'm busy with pretty big things\n\nI cancel most plans\n\nI hurt someone's feelings\n\nI feel like I'm starting\n\nAnd just when I'm starting, I'm starting to stray\n\n\n\nAnd everyday, I take a white page\n\nAnd try very hard to know just what to say\n\nJust what to say, just what to say\n\nI try very hard to know just what to say\n\nJust what to say, just what to say\n\n\n\nI've planted some clues\n\nThat I hope you find easily\n\nThings that I find hard to speak clear and true\n\nI think there's a part of you\n\nHoping I'm hoping you feel like I do\n\nAnd maybe you're listening somewhere you like to be\n\nWhere you let everything heavy just go\n\nOh, I'd like to be there\n\nHow I'd like to stay\n\nHow I'd like to listen\n\nHow I'd like to think I'd know just what to say\n\n\n\nJust what to say, just what to say\n\nI try very hard to know just what to say\n\nJust what to say, just what to say\n\n\n\nSomebody, somebody blocked the door\n\nI know it was me for sure\n\nBut somebody knows where I'm hidden away\n\n\n\nI try very hard to know just what to say\n\nJust what to say, just what to say\n\nI try very hard to know just what to say\n\nJust what to say, just what to say\n\nI try very hard to know just what to say\n\nJust what to say, just what to say",
