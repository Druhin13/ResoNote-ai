  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Melt par SHAED\r\nWhat’s the difference if it’s all good\nWhat’s the difference if I’m all tied up now\n\nI’ll get used to it all\nGuess I’m taking the fall\nWhat’s the difference if I can’t get up now\n\nNo it wasn’t right to pretend you were the light\n\nCan’t tell my feelings from my bones\n\nWait\nNow you’re dressing me in chains\nCallin every move I make\nNow you’re beggin me to smile, but I can’t fake\n\nThought the point was to create\nI can barely feel myself\nLike I’m frozen in the ice\nWish I could melt\n\nWhat’s the difference if it’s all good honey\nTry to float but it’s too cold and heavy\nSinking down ever more\nCan’t get up from the floor\nWhat’s the difference if I’m all messed up now\n\nNo it wasn’t right to pretend you were the light\nCan’t tell my feelings from my bones\n\nBones, bones, bones\n\n\nWait\nNow you’re dressing me in chains\nCallin every move I make\nNow you’re beggin me to smile, but I can’t fake\nThought the point was to create\nI can barely feel myself\nLike I’m frozen in the ice\nWish I could melt\nWish I could melt",
