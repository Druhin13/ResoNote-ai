  "lyrics": "Sour sweet as rain\r\nLeaves a stain\r\nPower, struggle of the heart\r\nYou can't tear apart the blame\r\nNow I know that hello is a show for a sweet goodbye\n\nNo tears to cry\n\n\n\nWhich one of us set on fire?\n\nCause we both went up in smoke\n\nWhich one of us cut the wire?\n\nAin't no bottom to this hole\n\n\n\nCoward burning the page\n\nRose from the flames\n\nFlowers tossed to the wind\n\nEnd to begin again\n\n\n\nNow I know that hello is a show for a sweet goodbye\n\nNo tears to cry\n\n\n\nWhich one of us set on fire?\n\nCause we both went up in smoke\n\nWhich one of us cut the wire?\n\nAin't no bottom to this hole\n\n\n\nWould you save me?\n\nAnd I'll save you\n\nWe can save ourselves\n\nWould you save me?\n\nAnd I'll save you\n\nWe can save ourselves\n\n\n\nWhich one of us set on fire?\n\nCause we both went up in smoke\n\nWhich one of us cut the wire?\n\nAin't no bottom to this hole\n\nWhich one of us set on fire?\n\nCause we both went up in smoke\n\nWhich one of us cut the wire?\n\nAin't no bottom to this hole",
