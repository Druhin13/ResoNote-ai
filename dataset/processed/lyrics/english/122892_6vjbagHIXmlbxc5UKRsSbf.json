  "lyrics": "I put in that work young nigga livin' his dreams\r\nI came out them trenches like Sting\r\nRemember them days when I used to sit on them swings\r\nAnd watch niggas dealin' to fiends\r\nThey served to my mama wish I had a burner to pop 'em\r\nYou don't know the feeling it brings\n\nI feel like the Hulk I used to have rips in my jeans\n\nBut I had to get to the green\n\nI swallowed the odds, because I'm anointed with God\n\nThe devil can't get in between\n\nGripping my chrome while I sit on my throne\n\nTell them niggas come on ain't no killin' the king\n\nYou'll die in the summer for talking that shit in the spring\n\nSo fall down like you sipping that lean\n\nIf you ain't from here you the visiting team\n\nYou gon' leave in a stretcher ain't no limousine\n\nBrace yourself for the truth it may hurt a bit\n\nThe good thing about pain is you learn from it\n\nMake sure your desire survives through the fire\n\nThe disappointment and discouragement\n\nBetter move like you know what your purpose is\n\nNever say die, learn to fly through that turbulence\n\nStop placing the blame you say it's God's\n\nBut really you don't know whose word it is\n\nGotta know who the serpent is know they oppress us\n\nThat bitch got more game than a tournament\n\nIn the church is the prayer from your preacher\n\nThat's program gets paid to perform at the services\n\nIf it ain't ether cancel it verses ain't tampered with\n\nRap god and my word is permanent\n\nI pack heat in my head like a perm in it\n\nSo you know how I roll like a percocet\n\nOne thing for certain is whoever purchased this\n\nGone say it's worth it he murdered it\n\nDon't forget so we know what we working with\n\nIf they try it we riot like Ferguson\n\nEarthquake so I step on your stomping grounds\n\nWhen it come to my kids I don't fuck around\n\nDo whatever then I hear they stomach growl\n\nPlay with mine you gon' learn how that thunder sounds\n\nBitch you better be real good at ducking down\n\nBefore you know what it's like to sleep underground\n\nIf you'd like then my .40 could dumb it down\n\nI'm so cold I could cool any summer down\n\nTook my time gave it thought like a chess move\n\nWeigh my options then go make my best move\n\nI do this shit for my fam\n\nI took that shot for my blood like a flesh wound\n\nNever answering questions no press room\n\nTalking foul might get hit with this tech soon\n\nSo don't get me pissed 'cause I'll go do that shit\n\nAnd then go wash my hands like a restroom\n\nGive your bitch the business like a manager\n\nPussy pink beat it up 'til it's lavender\n\nHow I fuck she gon' think he was amateur\n\nI don't smoke I don't drink I got stamina\n\nI'm a boss I got all of the sauce\n\nSo these hoes in my face want a taste like a sampler\n\nTell my haters they not my of caliber\n\nI get checks on you squares like a calendar\n\nBitch I ate off the web no tarantula\n\nDragon spit now I'm rich as a Lannister\n\nI am killing all rappers it's massacre\n\nWhen I drop yo' Baywatch like she Pamela\n\nBetter get out or dodge I ain't talkin' 'bout cars\n\nWhen I tell you I'm whippin' all challengers\n\nI held onto the Lord and I felt the support\n\nEvery step of the way like a banister\n\nLife's a bitch but I know how to handle her\n\nI stay strapped down to ride like a passenger\n\nAnd I'm good with the mop and if I spot a opp\n\nI hop clean on his ass like a janitor\n\nSo you better wise up 'cause it's overdue\n\nBe a fan of reality know the truth\n\nGo look far and look deep like an ocean view\n\nBut be cautious when they cannot show you proof\n\nWhen it seems like it's hell that you going through\n\nAnd them devil's demons got a hold of you\n\nGotta let ambition take control of you\n\nWatch God open that door and then show for you\n\nSo just embrace the pain\n\nAnd smile in the face of the rain\n\nWhen them clouds coming over you\n\nAnd watch who you selling to, not only that, man\n\nYou gotta watch who's on that boat with you\n\nAnd if they didn't roll with you\n\nDon't let them roll with you\n\nListen, I do not mean smoke with you\n\nAnd it don't mean a nigga won't snitch\n\nJust because he was broke with you\n\nAnd he would blow for you\n\nI've seen niggas tell on they homies\n\nJust 'cause they'd feel better\n\nIf it was the both of you\n\nAnd yeah, you love your family and friends\n\nBut sometimes it's important\n\nTo let them hear no from you\n\nI stay ready whenever I'm rolling through\n\nWhen a snake has no options he'll go for you\n\nRap god I'm goat to you, bringing that dope to you\n\nYou niggas wish that I wrote for you\n\nStarted rapping with bro like we Outkast\n\nDo a show then I feed my account cash\n\nI came up off the floor like a bounce pass\n\nSo don't call me unless it's about cash\n\nI'm fucking eating no Ramadan\n\nI fucked a Muslim on Ramadan\n\nI was trapping wasn't working no nine to five\n\nThe pizza I was selling wasn't no Papa John's\n\nSelling with my niggas like I'm a star\n\nGuns and drugs was the shit that we idolized\n\nI stay ready to blow and this shit not for sure\n\nBitch I fire up this pole then I'm popping mine\n\nNo talking no sparking there's blood everywhere\n\nSo you already knowing what's popping, slime\n\nI'll teach you a lesson with my Smith & Wesson\n\nBoy, don't make me take you to Columbine\n\nY'all know how I'm rocking\n\nMy rocket got 34 haters\n\nI'm Hakeem Olajuwon\n\nWhen I slide I'ma blow like a hockey ref\n\nPut his ass in the box if he out of line\n\nRap god the phenomenon God is my confidant\n\nI'm way too smart to run out of lines\n\nYou'll never see me like Conor McGregor vs. Mayweather in the octagon\n\nI just take names like a dotted line, then go kill everyone I could find\n\nNiggas don't wanna see me like father time, pulling up in that van like a soccer mom\n\nSliding drums in my guns when it's choppa time, then I let that bitch sing like it's Chaka Khan\n\nMy K waving hello, I stay with the metal, was raised in the ghetto\n\nI ain't finna settle, I came here to bless you\n\nLet's pray for the devil, he ain't on my level\n\n\n\nMoment of silence, let's pray for the blind\n\nSomeone you never met is who made up your mind\n\nSee the way you designed, ain't the way of the wise\n\nAnd the way you designed, ain't the way to survive\n\nIt's either one of two things\n\nJesus Christ ain't ever coming or he just like taking his time\n\nTold you earthlings to obey your earthly master\n\nBoy, you don't see the hate in the lies?\n\nAnd to fear him and tremble as if he was Christ\n\nThat ain't godly that's Satan disguised",
