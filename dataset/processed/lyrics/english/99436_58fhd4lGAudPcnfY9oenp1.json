  "lyrics": "Sandra, I'm ready to go\r\nI don't wanna be here anymore\r\nYou're wasted and I'm bored\r\nI suppose I'll show myself back to the door\r\nDo you remember yesterday?\n\nDid the conversation we had about life just float away?\n\nI sat you down, I chose to say\n\nYou're gonna be better off without me in the way\n\n\n\nYou see everybody running around losing their mind\n\nYou wanted me to hang around and now I'm losing mine\n\nA thousand days and you'll be doing fine\n\nWithout me, without me\n\n\n\nLife is wonderful on my own\n\nA million hours left to waste in a warm window\n\nBut all I ever wanna do is fall in love\n\nTo reconvene with every dream that I've been dreaming of\n\n\n\nYou see everybody running around with their head in the clouds\n\nAll of us are doing our best to figure it out\n\nA thousand tears and you'll be doing fine\n\nWithout me, without me\n\n\n\nEvery night I'm growing colder\n\nAnd every moon I'm feeling older\n\nThe cavalier is burning through my heart\n\nI never wanna be alone\n\nBut I here I am pacing round my empty home\n\nAll in all, it's nothing without love\n\n\n\nLately I've been thinking about you\n\nAll the curiosities near and far\n\nWhat colour is your hair?\n\nHow I miss the way you stare\n\nAnd do you still drive around your golden car?\n\nDo the birds still sing outside your window?\n\nOr is the mandolin I gave you still in tune?\n\nTo this day you've never tried to get in touch with me\n\nAnd I've never tried to get in touch with you\n\n\n\nYou see everybody running around in a crazy crowd\n\nIt's hard to hear when everyone's shouting out\n\nA broken heart is never hard to find\n\nBut darling is it yours or is it mine?\n\nAll in all, I hear you're doing fine\n\nWithout me, without me",
