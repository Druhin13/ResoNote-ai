  "lyrics": "I’ve been feeling weary, 70 degrees in February\r\nMama’s raking leaves, and I’m about to leave\r\nI-90 barreling down, Pacific Northwest-bound\r\nThrough this cage’s screens, watch the turning of the leaves\r\nOh I’m free, Oh I’m free\n\nOh, rest easy while I’m home\n\nWhile I’m home\n\n\n\nBut I ain’t often home, keep company but feel alone\n\nAll the sights to see, I know where I could be\n\nI’m a lonesome boy, but loneliness pair well with joy\n\nAll in all live, and learn what you can give that’s free\n\nOh that’s free\n\n\n\nHome, rest easy while I’m home\n\nWell I’m home\n\nHome, while I’m home\n\nWell I’m home\n\n\n\nOften miss my pa when I hear that Amanaz\n\nFollow Khala my friend down the road that has no end\n\nAin’t got time to meet someone I would treat in that loving way\n\nCause I’m leaving any day if I’m free\n\nOh I’m free\n\n\n\nOh, rest easy while I’m home\n\nWhile I’m home\n\n\n\nJust a traveling man in a traveling band\n\nHope to lend a hand before the Earth turns into sand\n\nWanted to have a daughter and a son that loves the water\n\nSwimming in the sea living worry-free\n\nFat chance, fat chance…\n\n\n\nHome, rest easy while I’m home\n\nWhile I’m home\n\nHome, rest easy while I’m home\n\nWhile I’m home\n\nHome, while I’m home\n\nWell I’m home",
