  "lyrics": "It's a one way street, with an open end\r\nAnd you never know, what lies ahead\r\nBut I always knew, that this was it\r\nThe signs were lit, oh I always knew\r\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\n\n\nI'm an overdrive, go to play offense\n\nAnd I won't look back, there be no regrets\n\nI keep my head up, even if I'm fed up\n\nCause I'm getting closer, oh I know, oh I know\n\n\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\n\n\nI'll be ready when the morning comes\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\n\n\nIt's a one way street, with an open end\n\nAnd you never know, what lies ahead\n\nBut I always knew, that this was it\n\nThe signs were lit, oh I always knew\n\n\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes\n\nI'm gonna hit the ground running, hit the ground running\n\nOnly way that for the marching drums, I'll be ready when the morning comes",
