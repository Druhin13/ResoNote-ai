  "lyrics": "I did my best to tame\r\nThe beast that cries my name\r\nFlicker into a flame\r\nInto a raging fire\r\nI can't contain\n\nYour tempos and your graves\n\nGive weary souls their shade\n\nI was meant to fly\n\nWith shadows in the sky\n\nI cannot stay\n\n\n\nI can hear the call of the wild\n\nI can hear the call of the wild\n\n\n\nHoldin' out for me\n\nI have to listen\n\n\n\nI want to be erased\n\nFor darkness to embrace\n\nLet nothing hold me back\n\nLet the whole world collapse\n\nThere's freedom in that\n\n\n\nThe love of many years\n\nGrows cold and now I fear\n\nThe mountains and the trees\n\nCry like a symphony (a symphony)\n\n\n\nI can hear the call of the wild\n\nI can hear the call of the wild\n\n\n\nHoldin' out for me\n\nI have to listen\n\n\n\nHoldin' out for me\n\nI have to listen\n\n\n\nHoldin' out for me\n\nI have to listen\n\n\n\nI did my best to tame\n\nThe beast that cries my name",
