  "lyrics": "And I wish you could stay, cause I know how this fades away\r\nIn time beside the cold, I find you in trouble\r\nAnd to be the one I love the most\r\nWe've wasted time\r\nWe've said \"I'll write\"\r\nWe'll find the cure, if we can hold on\n\nHolding on is the hardest part when your body could lie beneath the dirt\n\nBlame, it's always on the inside\n\nIt's in my heart, stuck in my head\n\nAnd to feel in my heart, maybe my love slipped away\n\nIn the deepest part, I'm finding grey\n\nYou don't have to find another one, cause I'm right here\n\nNow will our love remain?\n\nBlame, it's always on the inside\n\nIt's in my heart, stuck in my head\n\nContriving fear, I let it guilt me\n\nForgive my heart if I let it remain\n\nIf I can protect you and keep you near, will that repair all of my distant days?\n\nYou don't have to find another one, cause I'm right here\n\nNow will our love remain?\n\nBlame, it's always on the inside\n\n\n\nIt's in my heart, stuck in my head\n\nContriving fear, I let it guilt me\n\nForgive my heart if I let it remain\n\nHolding on is the hardest part when your body could lie beneath the dirt\n\nHolding on is the hardest part when all I can see is how Iâ€™ve hurt you\n\nAnd I wish you could stay, cause I know how this fades away",
