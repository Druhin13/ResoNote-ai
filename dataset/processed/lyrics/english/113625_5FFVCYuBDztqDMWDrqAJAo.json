  "lyrics": "My whole life I been curled up, worried 'bout fitting in\r\nDon't know what I am, I just know that I'm different\r\nSpazzed out, fidgeting\r\nPlaying with the monsters\r\nOnly open up around the creatures that I conjure\r\nFlashlights dangling underneath the stairs\n\nIf I ever went missin', they would always meet me there\n\nThey would be the ones to love me on the nights I needed care\n\nNever brought 'em out in public 'cause I hate when people stare\n\nI'll be fine\n\nJust losing track of time\n\nJust dancing in the city with these voices in my mind\n\nThey the only ones who listen when I tell em what I feel\n\nNo one ever understood, and they probably never will\n\n\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAway, away\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAwaaay\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAway, away\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nWatch me disappear just like a ghost\n\nGhost, ghost\n\nWatch me disappear just like a ghost\n\nGhost, ghost\n\n\n\nRiding through the city, I'm just buzzin' alone\n\nClose my eyes while I drive 'cause I love the unknown\n\nHeart beating so hard, feel it thud in my bones\n\nCan't say I Iove her, but I wrote her dozens of poems\n\nAnd I almost read 'em out loud hundreds of times\n\nClosed mouth, what a waste of a wonderful mind\n\nShe gets scared when the rain and the thunder combine\n\nAnd I'm from a gloomy place where the sun doesn't shine\n\nIt wouldn't work, so, I admire from afar\n\nLying on the rooftop, lining up the stars\n\nHiding all my scars is oh-so exhausting\n\nI just wanna get lost now\n\n\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAway, away\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAwaaay\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAway, away\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nWatch me disappear just like a ghost\n\nGhost, ghost\n\nWatch me disappear just like a ghost\n\nGhost, ghost\n\n\n\nGhost, ghost\n\nWatch me disappear just like a ghost\n\nGhost, ghost\n\n\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAway, away\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAwaaay\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nAway, away\n\nSo, I'm going now\n\nWatch me disappear just like a ghost",
