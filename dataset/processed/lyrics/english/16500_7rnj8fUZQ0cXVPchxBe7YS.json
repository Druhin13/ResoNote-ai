  "lyrics": "You would give up your right arm to go back\r\nTo when you had a right arm\r\nYou'll need some muscles\r\nTo move it backward\r\nPush back the hands of time\n\nBroken glass is glittering like diamonds\n\nCan't hear yourself thinking over the sirens\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\n\n\nYou wanna sing to drown out the car horn\n\nSqueeze your eyes shut and scream like a newborn\n\nLike a newborn babe\n\n\n\nDawn breaks like a fallen vase\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nUnwelcome vision of rosy fingers\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\n\n\nIt wouldn't help you if you'd had any sleep\n\nIt wouldn't save you from the mission creep\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\n\n\nScreeching tires but never a collision\n\nEndless day without a sunset provision\n\nEndless day\n\n\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\n\n\nYou wanna sing to drown out the car horn\n\nSqueeze your eyes shut and scream like a newborn\n\nLike a newborn babe\n\n\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time\n\nPush back the hands of time",
