  "lyrics": "I was the daughter of my father\r\nI was the colour of a half-lit moon\r\nRiding down sunset\r\nMaking records at night\r\nThere's a calling in my gut\r\nAnd I have to just follow it\n\n\n\nI was a girl in New York City\n\nCollecting stories like I'm saving money\n\nJust hanging on the wall\n\nWe didn't care at all\n\n'cause caring meant that we weren't invincible\n\n\n\nWhere is the line between all this joy and all this sorrow?\n\nWho do you know?\n\nIt helps you get from here to there to tomorrow\n\nWhat do I know? What do I know?\n\nI know that I want to see where this thing will go\n\n\n\nLet's resurrect the biggest feeling\n\nLike getting hit with something strong and hot\n\nWith our wine-stained teeth\n\nAnd some dirty little habits\n\nI would never change a thing\n\nJust the way I got out of bed\n\n\n\nWhere is the line between all this joy and all this sorrow?\n\nWho do you know?\n\nIt helps you get from here to there to tomorrow\n\nWhat do I know? What do I know?\n\nI know that I want to see where this thing will go\n\n\n\nAnd then I landed like I was dreaming\n\nCame back into\n\nI started beating\n\nWith a headstrong body and a soft soft voice\n\nAnd you never tried to change it you just\n\nWanted who I was\n\n\n\nWhere is the line between all this joy and all this sorrow?\n\nWho do you know?\n\nIt helps you get from here to there to tomorrow\n\nWhat do I know? What do I know?\n\nI know that I want to see where this thing willâ€¦\n\nGo",
