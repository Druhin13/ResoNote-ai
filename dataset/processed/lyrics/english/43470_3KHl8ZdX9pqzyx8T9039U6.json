  "lyrics": "I know the way you take your coffee in the morning\r\nAnd you know my place like the back of your hand\r\nI know you think romantic comedies are boring\r\nBut I make you watch them anyway just 'cause I can\r\nAnd I wake up excited to see you\n\nAnd I meet you at our favorite spot down the street\n\nYou're telling me that I should flirt with the waiter\n\nAs you talk about your date last night\n\nOh, how can I survive\n\n\n\nWhen I can't breathe and you can't see that you're\n\nKilling me slowly with your second hand love\n\nAnd the way she makes you light up, oh you're\n\nKilling me slowly with your second hand love\n\nYeah, you're killing me slowly with your second hand love\n\n\n\nYou know the way I laugh when something isn't funny\n\nAnd you know the way I smile when I'm about to cry\n\nSo how could you be so clueless not to know how I feel?\n\nWhen you say that I'm just one of the guys and I think that I might die\n\n\n\nAnd I wake up excited to see you\n\nAnd I meet you at our favorite spot down the street\n\nYou're telling me that I should flirt with the waiter\n\nAs you talk about your date last night\n\nOh, how can I survive\n\n\n\nWhen I can't breathe and you can't see that you're\n\nKilling me slowly with your second hand love\n\nAnd the way she makes you light up, oh you're\n\nKilling me slowly with your second hand love\n\nYeah, you're killing me slowly with your second hand love\n\n\n\nNobody gets you like I do\n\nI let you go, you pull me back\n\nAm I the only one waiting for\n\nThis heart attack, this heart attack\n\nNo matter where I go you're always in the air, and I\n\n\n\nCan't breathe and you can't see that you're\n\nKilling me slowly with your second hand love\n\nAnd the way she makes you light up, oh you're\n\nKilling me slowly with your second hand love\n\nYeah, you're killing me slowly with your second hand love\n\n\n\nYeah, you're killing me slowly with your second hand love",
