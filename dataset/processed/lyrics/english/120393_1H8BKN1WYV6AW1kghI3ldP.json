  "lyrics": "Dreaming a battle (get it)\r\nGive me time\r\nWalked these steps before\r\nSixteen-year-old boy\r\nTo feel so numb that it's deafening, walls'll give in\r\nAfter school, sucker punched down\n\nDown and out\n\n\n\nFirst kiss was the floor\n\nFirst kiss was the floor\n\n\n\nBut, God, it won't make a difference if you don't get up\n\nTell me the song, song\n\nI'm no [?]\n\nWhat they want me to think\n\nBut I'm changing the state\n\nAll that I know was taught to me young\n\nSeen it all before\n\n\n\nFirst kiss the floor\n\nFirst kiss the floor\n\nFirst kiss the floor\n\nShoot, baby, shoot\n\n\n\n(Live for the floor)\n\nYou know, an insult we often put onto\n\n(Livin' for what?)\n\nA lot of folk is, like, oh, you're doing too much\n\nSo like, a couple years ago I was like\n\nYou know what, my resolution, my eternal resolution will be to\n\n(Stay in your course)\n\nTo do too much\n\nYes, I love it",
