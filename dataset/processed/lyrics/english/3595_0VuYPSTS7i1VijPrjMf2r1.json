  "lyrics": "Yea, sometimes I be overthinking\r\nAbout the future try not to worry about it\r\nAny doubts try set it beside me\r\nI gotta bounce got to get it away\r\nMaybe to the bay in the waves when I sway what a day\r\nItll be\n\nWhen I finally make peace with my enemies\n\nWhen I finally set the keys on the centerpiece\n\nGot to calm down a bit\n\nI've been down a bit\n\nBut I bounce back\n\nI like the sound of that\n\nSummer 18 about a Break Free\n\nAll this up and down that is what made me\n\nChase safety not under oath\n\nBut would never tell a lie\n\nI'm ghost I'm a no show\n\nWhen they come to do a die gotta go go\n\nGot a roller by my side yeah I hope so\n\nThey say they want me to die that's a low blow\n\nLike oh no na\n\nWhy so many people evil\n\nWhy the fuck I even give a shit when I'm out\n\nOn my day get out my way\n\nI'm bound to break your face\n\nFace it\n\nI don't ever want to be basic\n\nDreams imma chase them\n\nI'm just be patiently waiting aching\n\nTill I fade it's a day's\n\nI won't care what they say\n\n\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\n\n\nImma do just what I want to do\n\nIf you rolling with me taken into infinity\n\nSempiternally we’ve been the affinity\n\nHit em internally I bet they ain’t a concern to me\n\nWhen I pull up to the city put the pedal on the concrete\n\nHold up wait a minute no one never going to stop me\n\nCome up with the vengeance yeah I'm feeling kind of cocky\n\nRunning from the fences imma pull up with the army\n\nCome up with the heat there will never disarm me\n\nI've been putting work in when the verses\n\nWhen we certain I heard you like sometimes\n\nIn the confines of my room No Sunshine\n\nI just got to unwind till the sunrise\n\nThese days I cope with sentences\n\nI will never lose hope cuz this is it\n\nI just got to stay focused in the mix\n\nClosing in and I broken in the griffs\n\n\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway\n\nI won't care about what nobody else want to say\n\nImma do just what I want to do anyway",
