  "lyrics": "(\"Sell me this pen\")\r\nRun through the wringer with my bros\r\nCan’t even count the years in this game on my fingers and my toes\r\nI don’t get open dancing on stage, I bring it to a close\r\nMake a sandwich out of my knuckles and bring it to your nose\n\nMink black, the link Turkish\n\nI wasn’t randomly selected, I was chose to serve a purpose\n\nOn many levels, you still scratching the surface\n\nMachine’s working, I’m wrapping packages for purchase\n\nSpeed in a German auto, not with the frivolous convo\n\nI’m in a drop rocking a hooded poncho\n\nTalking out your ass, something I put my foot in pronto\n\nNot the GOAT, but the way I float, it got my name put in the convo\n\nCodename: Spy Hunter, I’m fly for the summer\n\nPockets thick like 22 plied lumber\n\nMake a spectacle, observe me while I’m doing my numbers\n\nFadeaways with the tongue out when I’m shooting my jumpers\n\n\n\nFuck, bigger picture, if I rhyme, it’s just coincidence\n\nThese are God’s words given to my brain on top of instruments\n\nFiltered through a brush, so when I paint it’s never settling\n\nIt’s reggae roots, rock, or watch Roots rock “Adrenaline”\n\nFuck the rhetoric of any lies attached to me\n\nAssassinate my character with rumors and the blasphemy\n\nTruth’s crushed to the earth and then it rises\n\nWhile the working-late doctor working late with no surprises\n\nI sell ‘em stories, I don’t tell ‘em the end\n\nOnly person in this building who could sell ‘em this pen\n\n(Sell me this pen) Say it slow one time and never say it again\n\n‘Cause your day might … and you never know when\n\nThis my shot, no chase\n\nEither get briefed to the Evidence or there ain’t no case\n\nStill rock it off my hand so there ain’t no trace\n\nI’ve been around the planet but there ain’t no place\n\n\n\nMake sure the shit is for real, the woodgrain is Stradivari, Venice Chenille\n\nWe'll push caine to cash and carry, niggas was ill\n\nMake sure the visit was healed\n\nI put pain in every pad, we been in appeal\n\nMy bookbag was axillary, niggas could tell\n\nWrist is concealed, riches on top of riches, membership dues\n\nWe owe a lot of niggas venison til\n\nKind of fit link is from Nigerian grills\n\nI keep a plantain in back of the coupe\n\nBullets ta-ting like the grand wizard, spit a thing at your canoot\n\nChewing tobacco, raw lavish is loose\n\nBullets for Babylon, babbling rules\n\n365 donts, 249 patented moves\n\nFood la bouche, it’s maize in your mouth with horse radish and goose\n\nThe poor house is salt, crackers, and soup\n\nI’m Munchausen on rappers for juice—where is your proof?\n\nLike you could fuck with all of that in the booth\n\nI put professors on sabbatical too\n\nI put some ketchup on a rapper, little peppercorn ranch and it’s \"Mmm\"\n\nMy bishop ran up on your castle in slough, Ravishing Rude\n\nSome eucharist was on his hat in a cube\n\nThe hat flew, his ex let out the crack for fast food\n\n\n\n(\"I’m wondering whether or not to go to France next week\")",
