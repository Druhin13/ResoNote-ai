  "lyrics": "Maybe then we had time for that\r\nNow our patience is wearing off and we're tired again\r\nMaybe then, not in a darker phase\r\nI'm not praised for love, feeds when you're afraid\r\nWhat's your plans?\r\nTie me up again\n\nStill sometimes its all on lock, like I liked you then\n\nI remember being both dumb and reckless then\n\nI was able to pretend I was cool with it\n\nIn the back there, somewhere\n\nIn the distant out there\n\nThere's a landmark, with time spent\n\nIn providence, I see you there\n\nWhen once I was safe there\n\nNow I walk in danger\n\nAnd it calls me, with providence, in Providence\n\nTread lightly\n\n\n\nI love you, you cut through\n\nMy night spent without you\n\nAnd it calls me\n\nAnd I can't speak\n\nIn Providence, tread lightly\n\n\n\nYou know I'm not ashamed of it\n\nI'm dead and I don't think this feeling will end\n\n(Say you want your bed)\n\nWhat else can I say\n\nThat's unsaid\n\nI talk to you, my reach is long",
