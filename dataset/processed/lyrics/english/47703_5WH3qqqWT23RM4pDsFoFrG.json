  "lyrics": "I'm on the sofa\r\nI'm tryna gather my thoughts but then\r\nMy head's hurting and my mind is in a different place\r\nSo please, sign my death certificate\r\n(what)\r\nI'm just playing but grab some water for me on your way\n\nYou're all set and you're looking like a summer hit\n\nThe warm sands make the beach my favorite place\n\nAnd I'll say this ain't my favorite bit\n\nBut last night gave me demons that I need to fix ('cause)\n\n\n\nYou're not supposed to be here posing like a model\n\nYou're supposed to be somewhere else\n\nAnd I'm sorry but soon I gotta do somethin'\n\nSomethin' else and I'm running late\n\nAnd I won't say to any which one of us did it\n\nA couple drinks 'til we felt like living it\n\nWhen the moon hits the sun and we open our eyes\n\n\n\nYou were never my baby\n\nBut you did make me love you like it felt right\n\nJust for the night, oh I\n\nFeel like a band but I'm playing in the dark\n\nYou were never my lady\n\nAnd I've been around and out chasing highs\n\nFor tonight, oh I\n\nWanna see what you can do in the dark\n\n\n\nA cold shoulder, try to see it in a different way\n\nIn my hands, you'd be destined for a one-night stay\n\nThis life turns me upside down\n\nWhat I want isn't right, and I'm loving everything that I hate\n\nSo please, save me the trouble, the door is just that way\n\nAnd I don't ever wanna hear you calling my name, ever again\n\nI'm sorry for being this way ('cause)\n\n\n\nYou're not supposed to be here posing like a model\n\nYou're supposed to be somewhere else\n\nAnd I'm sorry but soon I gotta do somethin'\n\nSomethin' else and I'm running late\n\nAnd I won't say to any which one of us did it\n\nA couple drinks till we felt like living it\n\nWhen the moon hits the sun and we open our eyes\n\n\n\nYou were never my baby\n\nBut you did make me love you like it felt right\n\nJust for the night, oh I\n\nFeel like a band but I'm playing in the dark\n\nYou were never my lady\n\nAnd I've been around and out chasing highs\n\nFor tonight, oh I\n\nWanna see what you can do in the dark\n\nYou were never my baby\n\nBut you did make me love you like it felt right\n\nJust for the night, oh I\n\nFeel like a band but I'm playing in the dark\n\nYou were never my lady\n\nAnd I've been around and out chasing highs\n\nFor tonight, oh I\n\nWanna see what you can do in the dark\n\n\n\nYou were never my lady\n\nWanna see what you can do in the dark",
