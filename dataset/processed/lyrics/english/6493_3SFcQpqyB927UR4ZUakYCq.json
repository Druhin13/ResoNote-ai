You can sleep late\n\nOrder breakfast in bed, cheese eggs with the hotcakes\n\nNo address when we vacate\n\nJust a couple pictures when you update, cause...\n\n\n\nDats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae\n\nDats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae\n\nI ain't never met one like you and you ain't never met one like me\n\nGettin' freaky in between the sheets and rub ya booty 'til you fall asleep\n\n\n\nTalk to me baby I'm gon' listen\n\nTell me all about ya dreams and wishes\n\nYea, lemme provide what you been missin' so I can see you well off on yo' lil' mission\n\nAnd, I promise not to judge you\n\nSee I'm a vibe type nigga and my vibe wanna love you\n\nAnything I touch it shine\n\nThat's why I keep my hands to myself when it ain't mine\n\nThe good life you deserve it\n\nYou stuck by a nigga when ya homegirl say I wasn't worth it\n\nYou understood I wasn't perfect\n\nThat's why when we go shoppin' I don't care what the purse is\n\nTell 'em put it in the bag\n\nYou can call it what you want, 'bout bae I'm gon' bash\n\nShe got the code to the stash, and any lick I hit my bae get half\n\n\n\nDats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae\n\nDats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae Dats my bae\n\nI ain't never met one like you and you ain't never met one like me\n\nGettin' freaky in between the sheets and rub ya booty 'til you fall asleep",
