  "lyrics": "Forever I'll enjoy you undertaking come to see you every day now if I can \nIs it not the time for everybody I still wake on the fields of regret \nThere is something to this dream we're all involved in can I see it can I say it may exist \nWhy then don't the night show really matters if we dwell in the fields of regret \nWhat horror must invade the mind when the approaching judge shall find sinful deeds from all mankind \nWith death and nature in surprise behold the wretched sinners rise to meet the judge's searching eyes \n\nAnd when the doomed no more can flee from the flames of misery assist me while I die \n\nWander through those ever thoughts though if imagined but come down on it's so easy to resist \n\nRest me hide my years upon the planet sound another no part over won't forget \n\nWhen we laugh at the fields of regret",
