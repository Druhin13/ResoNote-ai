  "lyrics": "By the time you get this note\r\nWe'll no longer be alive\r\nWe'll have all gone up in smoke\r\nThere'll be no way to reply\r\nYou'll be wondering about the world that vanished long ago\r\nAnd the words that reach you now\n\nThat were buried underground\n\n\n\nGreetings to everyone in 1937\n\nIt seems that you were never aware that we were here\n\nYou're probably too busy rejoicing in the present\n\nTo stop and be reminded of the dark and troubled past\n\n\n\nBy the time you get this note\n\nWe'll no longer be alive\n\nBut our skulls are smiling still\n\nAt the thought of things to come\n\nWe can confidently know that you'll enjoy a better world\n\nWhen the evils that we faced\n\nWill at last be laid to rest\n\n\n\nWhen the poisons of the Earth\n\nAre completely neutralized\n\nWhen the hatred and the lies\n\nAre forever put aside\n\nWhen the voices of dissent and contradiction all abate\n\nAnd the peaceful air is filled\n\nWith a silent harmony\n\n\n\nWe can't be certain at the moment of this writing\n\nBut surely in the future there'll be no barking dogs\n\nThe sound of crying babies will be thankfully forgotten\n\nNo more will the chattering classes make a noise\n\n\n\nBy the time you get this note\n\nA millenium from now\n\nWe'll have all gone up in smoke\n\nThere'll be no way to reply\n\nAnd we confidently know\n\nYou'll enjoy a better time\n\nWhen the evils that we faced\n\nWill at last be laid to rest",
