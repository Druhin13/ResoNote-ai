I grabbed for the gun\n\nYou let off two times, one in the hip and back of my leg right under my ass\n\nBullet hit, breakin' the bone in half\n\nHospital two weeks and a half\n\nAfter that I healed up in a cell\n\nPrayin' to God when I was in jail\n\nGoing in black, they put you through hell\n\nHoldin' you ransom, raisin' your bail\n\nThrow you a sandwich, hot nigga, yeah\n\nYeah, I'm fully prepared\n\n\n\nStill got two phones, in the trenches, where the robbers at\n\nPut a stamp on in the backroom, I want all of that\n\nBought it in the trap, bought a knife and a pie\n\nI come from the same place, we still hustle when it's hot\n\nMake America trap again\n\nMake America trap again\n\nMake America trap again\n\nMake America trap again\n\nStill connected with the plug, but we keep that on the low\n\nI got it out the mud, goin' hard is all I know\n\nTryna make the trap great again, great again\n\nTryna make the trap great again, great again",
