  "lyrics": "It's been a great ride but here we sit tonight\r\nThe look in her eyes says something's wrong\r\nThis ain't a wild bull, it's just a bar stool\r\nBut it's all I can do to just hang on\r\nAnd George Strait's on the jukebox in the corner\r\nSinging about cowboys riding away, but\n\n\n\nThis ain't my first rodeo\n\nSomeone's gonna get hurt\n\nWhenever someone says we need to talk\n\nIt feels like there's a number\n\nPinned on to the back of my shirt\n\n'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off\n\nYeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off\n\n\n\nYou can go to Houston, Vegas or San Antonio\n\nAnd watch a bull rider hit the dirt\n\nOr head down to this bar for a little cover charge\n\nYou can watch me get thrown by her\n\nGeorge Strait's on the jukebox again\n\nSays if I leave now I can still make Cheyenne, but\n\n\n\nThis ain't my first rodeo\n\nSomeone's gonna get hurt\n\nSo hey bartender, give me one more jug\n\nIt feels like there's a number\n\nPinned on to the back of my shirt\n\n'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off\n\nYeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off\n\n\n\nI think about those nights in Marina Del Rey\n\nAs this beautiful cowgirl slips away\n\nBut the pain only lasts so long\n\nAnd when you get bucked off you get back on\n\n\n\nIt feels like there's a number\n\nPinned on to the back of my shirt\n\n'Cause this is where the cowboy gets bucked off\n\nYeah, this is where the cowboy gets bucked off",
