  "lyrics": "Show the man a pass\r\nEverything you've got\r\nPut it where he points and\r\nThrow it all on top\r\nHear the crunching beneath the junk let go\r\nA parrot cage and dial phones\n\n\n\nBlue for small electrics, microwaves in here\n\nTelevision pieces in a rusty skip\n\nBut be careful if you brought chemicals\n\nThey've got a place especially for those\n\n\n\nAnd there's always a busy crowd around\n\nPeople come from all over town (over town)\n\nDropping off the things that they no longer need to keep\n\n\n\nEverybody's collage stacking up the wall\n\nWhen the sun is out, the scent gets pretty tall\n\nBut the site operators don't care much\n\nThey're looking forward to their lunch\n\n\n\nAnd when we fill it up\n\nA lorry comes and drags it on the tarmac\n\nSomewhere far from here\n\nSo when they let us in at 6 A.M\n\nThe spaces are empty again\n\n\n\nAnd there's always a busy crowd around\n\nPeople come from all over town (over town)\n\nDropping off the things that they no longer need to keep",
