  "lyrics": "I sorta like deceiving\r\nAnd all this tragic loss\r\nI wanna find some patience\r\nBut kill the feelings off\r\nI wanna drown in praise\r\nBut never really deliver\n\nI wanna feel insane, insane\n\n\n\nSo long to go, you know\n\n\n\nNo matter how I cling to life\n\nI'm not fooling anyone\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nAnd when the well is dead and dry\n\nI'll keep begging you to start a war\n\nOh, I'm not original anymore\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\n\n\nDo I start it over\n\nBefore I self-destruct?\n\nWhat's the perfect way to say I'm lost? I just give up\n\nYeah, I wanna try and change (I wanna try and change)\n\nThe vanity in the mirror\n\nI know you feel the same, insane\n\n\n\nSo long to go, you know\n\n\n\nNo matter how I cling to life\n\nI'm not fooling anyone\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nAnd when the well is dead and dry\n\nI'll keep begging you to start a war\n\nOh, I'm not original anymore\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\n\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\n\n\nOne by one, they fall\n\nUse your words for war\n\nChasing open doors\n\nFor what it's worth\n\n\n\nNo matter how I cling to life\n\nI'm not fooling anyone\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nAnd when the well is dead and dry\n\nI'll keep begging you to start a war\n\nI'm not original anymore\n\nI'm not original anymore",
