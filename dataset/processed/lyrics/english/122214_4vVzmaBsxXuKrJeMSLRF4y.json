  "lyrics": "Kick it!\r\nDrag the lake\r\nYou won't find me\r\nI've been tempting fate\r\nWith my heart beside me\n\n\n\nI am the stone below the water\n\nCold and hard to touch\n\nJust when you think I can't get lower\n\nI turn my back and fuck it up\n\n\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\n\n\nSo come and drag the lake\n\nYou see I've done some diving\n\nI've got some extra weight\n\nWith no one to untie me\n\n\n\nI am the stone below the water\n\nCold and hard to touch\n\nJust when you think I can't get lower\n\nI turn my back and fuck it up\n\n\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\n\n\nI'll stare into the sea\n\nTo burn out what I've done\n\nI'll tear myself apart\n\nTo see what I've become\n\nNothing wrong with my depression\n\nMy sinking is a full obsession\n\nIf I can only give some space\n\nIf I could only learn my lesson\n\n(If I could only learn my lesson)\n\n\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me\n\nYou can drag the lake\n\nBut you won't find me",
