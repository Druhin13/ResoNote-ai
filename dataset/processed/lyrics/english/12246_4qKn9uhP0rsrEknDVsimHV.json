  "lyrics": "Rattle on the rusty pipes\r\nHit 'em hard, and hit 'em bright and clear\r\nAnd make a noise, so everyone cannot mistake it's you\r\nAnd let 'em know just what it's like\r\nWhen you're not alright\n\n\n\nPray to god it won't get worse\n\nThat you'll be riding in a hearse to this\n\nThe party that you don't want to be ever invited to\n\n\n\nBut you'll be goin' anyway\n\nHowever much you pray\n\n\n\nDefine a way, you'll find a way\n\nNo matter what I say\n\n\n\nRattle on the rusty pipes\n\nWake 'em up; give them a fright\n\nThey can't just shake off like a scary dream\n\nThey have most every night\n\n\n\nDon't even try; I can't be saved\n\nI'm beautiful and brave",
