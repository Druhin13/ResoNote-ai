  "lyrics": "And if I finally lose side of it\r\nThere's something that I hide in the heart of it\r\nImagine just how dark it is\r\nCan you imagine how deep it is?\r\nI know the ropes\n\nMake my own way there\n\nI hold the lines from way back when\n\n\n\nI feel the pull of gravity\n\nAs if it to think it could fade on me\n\nI start to feel there's nowhere to go\n\nLight my mind in overload\n\nBut I made up my mind I'm coming back\n\nI hold the line from way back then\n\n\n\nWe better leave before the flood\n\nBefore the earth has shaken all\n\nAnd I've got the time to trace it back\n\nI draw the lines from way back there",
