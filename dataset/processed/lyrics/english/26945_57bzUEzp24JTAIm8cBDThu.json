  "lyrics": "I don't care for the confusion\r\nWhen the one you love just goes away\r\nYou exchange a lie for a feelin'\r\nAnd you are left kneeling when they go away\r\nAnd you feel like dyin' because that feeling won't go away\n\nAnd you can't run away from yourself, so there's nowhere you can go\n\nYou're better off alone\n\n\n\nI don't care for the sorrow\n\nWhen the one you love just doesn't call\n\nAnd given time and peace of mind\n\nYou yourself won't care, and all\n\n\n\nAnd all that something means nothing at all\n\nAnd you can't run away from yourself, so there's nowhere you can go\n\nYou're better off alone\n\nYou're better off alone\n\nYou're better off alone",
