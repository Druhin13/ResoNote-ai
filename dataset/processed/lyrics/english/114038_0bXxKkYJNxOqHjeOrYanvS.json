  "lyrics": "I've been watching you walk\r\nI've been learning the way that you talk\r\nThe back of your head is at the front of my mind\r\nSoon I'll crack it open just to see what's inside your mind\r\nInside your mind\n\n\n\nMaybe I will wait until you're fast asleep\n\nDreaming things I have the right to see\n\nMaybe you are dreaming you're in love with me\n\nThe only option left is look and see\n\n\n\nInside your mind\n\n\n\nI can show you the photographs of you getting on with life\n\nI've had dreams where there's blood on you\n\nAll those dreams where you're my wife\n\n\n\nInside your mind\n\nInside your mind\n\nInside your mind\n\nInside your mind",
