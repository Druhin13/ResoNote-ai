  "lyrics": "Stuck inside a house I built\r\nLocked the doors and closed the shutters\r\nWith no strength left to cry for help\r\nI hid in bed under the covers\r\nStuck inside a shade of blue\n\nSadness was my only comfort\n\nI didn't know that only You\n\nCould fill my world with all the colors\n\n\n\nThis is my awakening\n\nThat while my heart was fast asleep\n\nYou were resurrecting me\n\nI thought that I would never breathe\n\nI thought the pain would never leave\n\nBut You're redeeming everything\n\n\n\nNow there's a dawn at every turn\n\nYou speak to me in new beginnings\n\nA ray of sun to heal the hurt\n\nThe music stops but You're still singing\n\n\n\nThis is my awakening\n\nThat while my heart was fast asleep\n\nYou were resurrecting me\n\nI thought that I would never breathe\n\nI thought the pain would never leave\n\nBut You're redeeming everything\n\nEverything, everything\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is my awakening\n\nI'm never going back to sleep\n\nHow could I after what I've seen\n\nThis is my awakening\n\nThere's color now in everything\n\nColor now in everything\n\n\n\nThis is my awakening\n\nI'm never going back to sleep\n\nHow could I after what I've seen\n\nThis is my awakening\n\nThere's color now in everything\n\nColor now in everything",
