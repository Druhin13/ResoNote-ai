  "lyrics": "Well, I'm not sold on soulmates\r\nBut do believe in twist of fate\r\nI don't believe in shootin' stars\r\nBut made a wish and here we are\r\nBut what if we're not meant to be?\r\nWhat if dreams aren't meant for dreams?\n\nDon't believe in being sad\n\nSo, would you try to understand, when I ask?\n\n\n\nIf we fall apart\n\nWho should I call to help me mend my heart?\n\nIf feelings fade and go their separate ways\n\nWho'd be my light in dark\n\nWell, I don't know\n\nBut what I do know is, I hope they never do\n\nI don't know who I'd be without you\n\n\n\nI've always liked the way you think\n\nTry to see your side of things and you asked\n\nWhat could we be a better yet?\n\nWhat if we had never met at all?\n\n\n\nAnd if we fall apart\n\nWho would I call to help me mend my heart?\n\nIf feelings fade, we go our separate ways\n\nWho'd be my light in dark\n\nWell, I don't know\n\nBut what I do know is, I hope we never do\n\nI don't know who I'd be without\n\n\n\nYou and all your little things\n\nYou've taught me love, you make me sing\n\nI wonder if you'll ever know the truth\n\nThat you and all the things you do\n\nPut every piece of me into\n\nAnd if we part forever, I'll be blue\n\nBut if we decide to separate\n\nBefore I go, I've gotta say that\n\n\n\nIf we fall apart\n\nI'll be right here to help you mend your heart\n\nIf feelings fade, we go our separate ways\n\nI'll be your light through dark\n\nAnd even though I'll know you're not alone\n\nOne thing will still be true\n\nI don't know who I'd be without\n\nHow would I even breathe without\n\nI don't know who I'd be without you",
