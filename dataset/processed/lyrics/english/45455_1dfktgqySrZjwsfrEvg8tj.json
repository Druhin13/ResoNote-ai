  "lyrics": "Fresh statics dripping\r\nFrom the television\r\nLow light fills up the room\r\nThere's no pretty pictures\r\nOr colours you've been missing\r\nYou need something else to sink your teeth in to\n\n\n\nComing up up, Coming up up for air\n\n\n\nWe are young\n\nTwisted, troubled but we've got each other\n\nLet's scream\n\nAt the top of our lungs\n\nWe're just reckless young guns\n\n\n\n\n\nI've got suspicion\n\nBut you just won't listen\n\nI'll find a way to get across to you\n\nCan't see, blurred vision\n\nIt's love not submission\n\nI need something else to sink my teeth into\n\n\n\nComing up up, Coming up up for air\n\n\n\nWe are young\n\nTwisted, troubled but we've got each other\n\nLet's scream\n\nAt the top of our lungs\n\nWe're just reckless young gun\n\n\n\nComing up, up\n\n\n\nWe all fall down sometimes\n\nWe pick ourselves up alright\n\nThis is a generation\n\nIn need of liberation\n\nSo if you're feeling down\n\nLike no one wants you around\n\nListen I promise you'll see\n\nThere's someone who cares deeply\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are young\n\nTwisted, troubled but we've got each other\n\nLet's scream\n\nAt the top of our lungs\n\nWe're just reckless young gun\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are young\n\nTwisted, troubled but we've got each other\n\nWe've got each other\n\nI'll scream\n\nAt the top of my lungs\n\nI'm a reckless young gun\n\nA reckless young gun",
