  "lyrics": "Last night, you said you love me\r\nLast night, you said you needed me\r\nWhen I woke up, I never saw your face\r\nWhen I woke up, you never left a trace\r\nAnd if there's nothing I can say or do\r\nI'll sing this song, I wanna sing to you\n\nI don't wanna dream if my dream is without you\n\nI don't wanna sleep if my dream will only be blue\n\nI don't wanna hear the words, I don't wanna feel your touch\n\nAll I know is that you hurt me so much\n\nYou said that we would stay together\n\nI thought that we would be forever\n\nI never thought we'd ever part\n\nBut now I have a broken heart\n\nI wonder why I never understand\n\nBut I understood when I saw you then\n\nBoy, it's been three years since we part\n\nAnd all those years I never had a change of heart\n\nI'm not asking you back, I just need a friend\n\nAll I'm asking is, let me dream again",
