  "lyrics": "Jessie is a friend,\r\nYeah I know he's been a good friend of mine\r\nBut lately something's changed\r\nIt ain't hard to define\r\nJessie's got himself a girl\r\nAnd I want to make her mine\n\nAnd she's watching him with those eyes\n\nAnd she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!\n\nAnd he's holding her in his arms late, late at night\n\n\n\nYou know I wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nWhere can I find her, a woman like that?\n\n\n\nI'll play along with this charade\n\nThat doesn't seem to be a reason to change\n\nYou know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute\n\nI wanna tell her that I love but the point is probably moot\n\n'Cause she's watching him with those eyes\n\nAnd she's lovin' him with that body, I just know it!\n\nAnd he's holding her in his arms late, late at night\n\n\n\nYou know I wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nWhere can I find her, a woman like that?\n\n\n\nLike Jessie's girl\n\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nWhere can I find her, a woman...\n\nWhere can I find her, a woman like that?\n\n\n\nAnd I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time\n\nWonderin' what she don't see in me\n\nI've been funny; I've been cool with the lines\n\nAin't that the way love's supposed to be?\n\nTell me why can't I find a woman like that?\n\n\n\nYou know I wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nWhere can I find her, a woman like that?\n\n\n\nLike Jessie's girl\n\nI wish that I had Jessie's girl\n\nI want, I want Jessie's girl",
