  "lyrics": "Honestly I thought your honesty meant something to you, in the end\r\nAll of your words were high there but I told myself I had not found love, once again\r\nTell me it's all in my head, tell me I imagined all of it\r\nThat there's no one else, so don't worry, but were always wiser in the end\r\nGo on and lie to my face\n\nTell me again how you love me while kissing another girl\n\nLie to my face\n\nSay that you need me, without us there's no other way\n\nTell me this won't ever end\n\nTell me it over and over again\n\nLie to me my friend\n\n\n\nI saw you looking and her, you said you were friends but I knew that you weren't\n\nWhat is a girl meant to do, when she discovers her man is a fool\n\nI know she's playing with you, but this ain't a game, I thought this here was true\n\n\n\nSo go on and lie to my face\n\nTell me again how you love me while kissing another girl\n\nLie to my face\n\nSay that you need me, without us there's no other way\n\nTell me this won't ever end\n\nTell me it over and over again\n\nTell me this won't ever end\n\nTell me it over and over again\n\n\n\nLie to me\n\nOh, lie to me\n\n\n\nTell me this won't ever end\n\nTell me it over and over and over again\n\nLie to my face\n\nSay that you need me, without us there's no other way",
