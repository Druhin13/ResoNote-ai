  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\n5pm, we stepping out the door\r\nTo the kitchen, super slipping if it's raw\r\nDine til you shine or grind\r\nCause team hungry eat the beans up off the floor\n\nThe steam from the core, or steam from the kettle\n\nPicking petals til it's three clovers, slip em in the door\n\nLet the system stay persistent, couple inches from the shore\n\nWater through my shoes, so we kick it at the porch\n\nWhile the singers in the window with the drop down Porsche\n\nBut the only droptop is the bottom of my jaw\n\nStuck in between the mountain and the fountain\n\nSee the youth drown out the shouting with a verse and open county\n\nHungry for the bounty cause the money equals something\n\nSucker, fucker, motherfucker think he found me\n\nSun setting over county, but I'm 0-5, no type, from a place you've never been, so how you gon' profile?\n\nDamn, city think I need a cosign\n\nA pretty ?, ya boy sitting on a gold mine\n\nSo I'ma hope the next flight\n\nGo forward 6 months, 2 week and 1 night\n\nCause at the end of the week\n\nIf the sun still shine and my mind stays mine for 7 nights, I'm sweet\n\nShit, so grab a fucking CD, hit track 3, uh, and let that motherfucker bleed, wassup",
