  "lyrics": "You don’t mean to be a problem\r\nYou don’t mean to cause me pain\r\nYou don’t mean to do much but it’s one and the same\r\nI don’t know where this came from\r\nI thought we were plain sailing\r\nThis has taken me aback and it goes without saying\n\nYeah I’m gonna feel broken for a bit\n\nLife’s gonna be a little bit shit\n\nOhh, for at least the next week\n\nWe had our flaws I’ll be the first to admit\n\nAnd we both struggled to commit\n\nOhh, was it really that bleak?\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t know why I’ve been crying over you\n\nFor the life of me, I wish that I knew\n\nAnd I don’t know, just how much more I can go through\n\nMan oh man I wish I knew, I’ve been crying over you\n\n\n\nI don’t mean to be a problem\n\nI don’t mean to cause you pain\n\nDon’t wanna break it up but, there’s no other way\n\nYou’re not the only one who’s hurting\n\nOr who’s finding this hard\n\nBut you gotta admit that we’re drifting apart\n\nLook we’re gonna feel broken a bit\n\nAnd it’s gonna be a little bit shit\n\nBut you’ll find the strength when you’re weak\n\nYou’ll find a love when you least expect it\n\nIt could be any minute\n\nSo don’t fight the tears on your cheek\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t know why I’ve been crying over you\n\nFor the life of me, I wish that I knew\n\nAnd I don’t know, just how much more I can go through\n\nMan oh man I wish I knew, I’ve been crying over you\n\n\n\nYou may be the one hurting\n\nAnd though I can’t say when\n\nI know love will find its way again, way again\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t know why I’ve been crying over you\n\nFor the life of me, I wish that I knew\n\nAnd I don’t know, just how much more I can go through\n\nMan oh man I wish I knew, I’ve been crying over you\n\nMan oh man I wish I knew, I’ve been crying over you\n\nMan oh man I wish I knew, I’ve been crying over you",
