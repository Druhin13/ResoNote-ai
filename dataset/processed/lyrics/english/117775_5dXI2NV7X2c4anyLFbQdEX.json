Let me know.\"\n\nI told her, \"Thinking is all wrong\n\nLove will happen when it wants\n\nI know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go.\"\n\n\n\nCause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you\n\nCause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you\n\n\n\nShe said, \"What if I tell you all the things I've done?\n\nWould you run away from me?\"\n\nI told her, \"Baby, we all got bags full of shit that we don't want\n\nBut I can unpack it for you, baby.\"\n\n\n\nShe said, \"What if I dive deep?\n\nWill you come in after me?\n\nWould you share your flaws with me? Let me know.\"\n\nI told her, \"Thinking is all wrong\n\nLove will happen when it wants\n\nI know it hurts sometimes, but don't let it go.\"\n\n\n\nCause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you\n\nCause I want you, I want you, I want- I want you\n\n\n\nI want you, I want you, I want you\n\nYeah",
