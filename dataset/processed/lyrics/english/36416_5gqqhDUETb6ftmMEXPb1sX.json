  "lyrics": "They're putting up the chairs too close, she let me settle up my tab\r\nI tore the button off your coat as you jumped up to hail us a cab\r\nWe can get a cup of coffee unless you gotta get back home\r\nSitting across that table, a gypsy couldn't read her mind\r\nI took her hand and told her I just wanna crawl into your eyes\r\nShe shook her head and said, It's cold; cold is just a cheap disguise\n\n\n\nHave you ever known a real love?\n\nThe kind of love that makes you feel, love?\n\nNo, this ain't let's make a deal, love\n\nIt'd make an angel give his wings up\n\nIt makes you guilty 'cause you want more\n\nIf it's a kiss that you would die for\n\nFeels like you're falling through the stars\n\nIf it could break your heart\n\nIt's real love\n\n\n\nWe drank that muddy pot of coffee; it was colder when I walked her home\n\nI've never been this lonely, lying in this bed alone\n\nHer words still ringing in my head, a sea of blackness like a stone\n\n\n\nHave you ever known a real love?\n\nThe kind of love that makes you feel, love?\n\nNo, this ain't let's make a deal, love\n\nIt'd make an angel give his wings up\n\nIf it makes you guilty 'cause you want more\n\nIf it's a kiss that you would die for\n\nFeels like you're falling through the stars\n\nIf it can break your heart\n\nIt's real love\n\n\n\nI put on that same shirt, and I ran out the door\n\nStole a fistful of roses from the sidewalk store\n\nWith just my heart in my hand I had nothing to prove\n\nStanding up on her front steps calling to her window\n\n\n\nHave you ever known a real love?\n\nThe kind of love that makes you feel, love?\n\nNo, this ain't let's make a deal, love\n\nIt'd make an angel give his wings up\n\nMake you guilty 'cause you want more\n\nIf there's a kiss that you will die for\n\nFeels like you're falling through the stars\n\nIf it can break your heart\n\nIt's real love\n\nLike you're falling through the stars\n\nIf it can break your heart\n\nIt's real love",
