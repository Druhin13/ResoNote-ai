  "lyrics": "Living for the weekend state of mind Makes me sick\r\nJust thinking of the bad habits\r\nPeople passing out in parking lots\r\nThat you only live once way of thinking\r\nIt's so twisted are you living or just wasted\r\nAn escape 'cause you can't face it\n\n\n\nIf a psycho said this is the end\n\nI think I'd believe him\n\n\n\nNow the whole world is full of it\n\nBuilding a bunker and jumping in\n\nAfter everyone self-destructs\n\nPop the hatch and we'll climb back up\n\n\n\nNow the whole world is full of it\n\nBuilding a bunker and jumping in\n\nAfter everyone self-destructs\n\nPop the hatch and we'll climb back up\n\nBack up\n\n\n\nThis self-centered generation taking pictures\n\nOf themselves then changing features\n\nPleasing over critical creatures\n\nEveryones got a cause but how strong is the foundation?\n\nMoving like the waves of the ocean\n\nDo you care or just throw stones in?\n\n\n\nIf a billboard read this was the end\n\nI think I'd believe it\n\n\n\nNow the whole world is full of it\n\nBuilding a bunker and jumping in\n\nAfter everyone self-destructs\n\nPop the hatch and we'll climb back up\n\n\n\nNow the whole world is full of it\n\nBuilding a bunker and jumping in\n\nAfter everyone self-destructs\n\nPop the hatch and we'll climb back up\n\nBack up\n\n\n\nI heard there's a hot new craze of driving off a steep cliff\n\nAre you gonna do it? What will they say if you won't\n\nI hear there's a brand new trend where you swallow bags of thumbtacks\n\nAre you gonna do it? What will they say if you don't?\n\n\n\nNow the whole world is full of it\n\nBuilding a bunker and jumping in\n\nAfter everyone self-destructs\n\nPop the hatch and we'll climb back up\n\n\n\nNow the whole world is full of it\n\nBuilding a bunker and jumping in\n\nAfter everyone self-destructs\n\nPop the hatch and we'll climb back up\n\nBack up\n\n\n\n(It's the end of the world as we know it)\n\nI'm building a bunker and jumping in\n\nAre you gonna do it?\n\n(It's the end of the world as we know it)\n\nWhat will I say if you won't?\n\n(It's the end of the world as we know it)\n\nI'm building a bunker and jumping in\n\nAre you gonna do it?\n\n(It's the end of the world as we know it)\n\nWhat will I say if you don't?",
