  "lyrics": "I lift my eyes to the mountains\r\nFrom where shall help come to me?\r\nMy hope comes from the Lord my God\r\nFor he is merciful.\r\nWhen we are lost, he searches for us\n\nTo hold us in his arms.\n\nHis holy blood will heal our wounds\n\nTo breathe new life into us.\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nBlest are the merciful, blest are the merciful.\n\nFor it is mercy, that shall be shown to those who show mercy. [2x]\n\n\n\n[Vs. 2]\n\nUnless the Lord forgives when we fall\n\nWe wouldn't be able to stand\n\nBut he forgives, he pardons us\n\nLet us do the same.\n\n\n\nGod paid our debts with the blood of his son\n\nWho rose to life from the tomb.\n\nOur spirit within cries out to the world: \n\nJesus is the Lord!\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\n[Bridge]\n\nSo cast aside your fear and have faith\n\nGive your cares to the Lord.\n\nTrust in Him for He has risen\n\nThe Lord your God is Alive!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gracias a Luciana por esta letra)",
