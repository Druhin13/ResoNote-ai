  "lyrics": "It's been a while like ancient history\r\nNow here you are taking up those memories\r\nSomethings are better left buried, honestly\r\nNo time for thinking about what things could've been\r\nIt's kinda hard for me to hear what you say\r\nI'm deffing by the lies you fabricate\n\nI'm not saying, I'm not saying that I wish you bad\n\nBut I ain't throwing fountain pennies tryna wish you back, no\n\n\n\nAll the ones who broke my heart\n\nThey want a piece of me now\n\nThey want a piece of me now (ain't it funny how)\n\nAll the ones who kept me out\n\nHow come they calling me now?\n\nHow come they calling me now?\n\n\n\nUsed to never hit reply when I hit you up\n\nBut now you try, try, try with your phony love\n\nIt's like you think I've become somebody different\n\nLet me adress that my adress don't make no difference\n\nWhat's inside ain't defined by a cycle\n\nDo you really think that I wouldn't know\n\nTake a second and I'll bless you with some information\n\nI'd rather haters than some lovers who be lovers faking\n\n\n\nAll the ones who broke my heart\n\nThey want a piece of me now\n\nThey want a piece of me now (ain't it funny how)\n\nAll the ones who kept me out\n\nHow come they calling me now?\n\nHow come they calling me now?\n\n\n\nI guess you needed something\n\nBut I ain't your callgirl\n\nIt's time you realized something\n\nI ain't no ones callgirl\n\nI guess you needed something\n\nBut I ain't your callgirl\n\nIt's time you realized something\n\nI ain't no ones callgirl\n\n\n\nAll the ones who broke my heart\n\nThey want a piece of me now\n\nThey want a piece of me now (ain't it funny how)\n\nAll the ones who broke my heart\n\nThey want a piece of me now\n\nThey want a piece of me now (ain't it funny how)\n\nAll the ones who kept me out\n\nHow come they calling me now?\n\nHow come they calling me now?",
