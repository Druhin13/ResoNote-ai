  "lyrics": "We're sewn in the ocean made of\r\nGold and emotion wake up\r\nKnow when you hold yourself\r\nA holy well\r\nOf total devotion, oh love\n\nNow we're picking flowers for vases and makin towers we made it my baby\n\nI find these hours are sacred and takin time from you's wastin away\n\n\n\nI feel your call here\n\nWe grow so tall\n\nThrough it all dear\n\nFeel your call here\n\nGrow so tall\n\nThrough it all dear\n\n\n\nPlayed and repeating\n\nYou painted your meaning on the wall\n\nOn the wall, on the wall it can't ever receive it, no\n\nYou know you're all that you needed all along\n\n\n\nFeel your call here\n\nGrow so tall we're\n\nThrough it all dear",
