  "lyrics": "Harvest your love, harvest your love, for me\r\nI'll lay it down, I'll lay it down, slowly\r\nPut your hands on my face\r\nAt an orderly pace\r\nI see\r\nPut your love in the sand\n\nAs it makes no demands\n\nI believe\n\n\n\nBut you keep on rolling\n\nLike a rolling stone\n\nAnd you fight until the finish line\n\nCarries you home\n\nCarries you home\n\n\n\nI had a plan, I had a plan you see\n\nBased on the rules that my mother and father taught me\n\nPress the iron when it's hot\n\nAnd you jump right in\n\nBecause the unfed mind devours itself\n\nWater your garden\n\n\n\nBut you keep on rolling\n\nLike a rolling stone\n\nAnd you'll fight until the finish line\n\nCarries you home\n\nCarries you home\n\n\n\nBut you keep on rolling\n\nLike a rolling stone\n\nAnd you'll fight until the finish line\n\nCarries you home\n\nCarries you home",
