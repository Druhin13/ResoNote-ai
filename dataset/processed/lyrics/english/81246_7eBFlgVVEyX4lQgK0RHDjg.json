  "lyrics": "They're all set to go on the 18th of June\r\nThey've already mapped out their honeymoon\r\nGot the church, got the flowers\r\nAnd the bridesmaids dresses on hold\r\nHe's Mr Perfect in so many ways\n\nHer daddy's so proud and her momma says hey\n\nYou've got a good one\n\nShe says yeah thanks I know\n\n\n\nShe should be happily wrapped in a dream\n\nDying to kiss him and put on his ring\n\nSo why is she walking alone after midnight\n\nDown a small town street\n\nWith cold feet\n\n\n\nThree days ago it came in the mail\n\nFrom an old love she thought had long ago set sail\n\nSaying baby it's killing me\n\nI hear you're tying the knot\n\n\n\nBut you should be happily wrapped up with me\n\nIt took me until right now but I finally see\n\nSo why don't you meet me one night\n\nAt our old spot down by the creek\n\nIf you've got cold feet\n\n\n\nOoo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo\n\nOoo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo\n\n\n\nRain on the sidewalk\n\nDoubt in her mind\n\nOne things for sure\n\nShe's running out of time\n\nTo decide\n\nWhat's right\n\nAnd who's heart she's willing to break\n\n\n\nShe should be happily wrapped in a dream\n\nSafe in a warm bed and sound asleep\n\nBut here she is walking back home\n\nFrom a long night down by the creek\n\nWith cold feet\n\n\n\nHere she is walking back home after midnight\n\nTrying to breathe\n\nWith cold feet",
