  "lyrics": "I'm not backin' down\r\nI made it too far to say that the war is over now\r\nSomehow I was neglectin' the fact that your heart is what you're protectin'\r\nAnd that makes it special\r\nWhich is why I'm here\r\nStandin' on this ledge, tryin' to make it clear\n\n\n\nI'm ready to fall for you\n\nI've been waiting too long\n\nI've gotta fight for us\n\nAnd I know I'm right where I needed to be all along\n\nSo until I have your love, there's no surrender, no retreat\n\nI'm never givin' up until I sweep you off your feet\n\nI need your love (your love, your love, your love)\n\n\n\nYes I, let you down\n\nI wasn't the man you wanted to fall for the first time around\n\nAmmunition just wasn't sufficient\n\nThe bullets in my pistol kept missin'\n\nYour heart, but I'm re-loaded\n\nI just walked out and got you open\n\n\n\nI'm ready to fall for you\n\nI've been waiting too long\n\nI've gotta fight for us\n\nAnd I know I'm right where I needed to be all along\n\nSo until I have your love, there's no surrender, no retreat\n\nI'm never givin' up until I sweep you off your feet\n\nI need your love (your love, your love, your love)\n\n\n\nOooh, I need your love (your love, your love, your love)\n\nI need your love (your love, your love, your love)\n\nGirl, I need your love (your love, your love, your love)",
