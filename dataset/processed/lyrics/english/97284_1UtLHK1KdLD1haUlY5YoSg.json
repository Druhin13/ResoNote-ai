  "lyrics": "Cross off the days gone\r\nCross off the days gone\r\nGone by\r\nWasting away our self inflicted slow decay\r\nWhat should have been, what never was\n\nBecame the end for both of us\n\n\n\nHeavy is the hand that points the finger (finger)\n\nHeavy is the heart that's filled with anger (anger)\n\n\n\nSo lay them all to waste\n\nYears you've decided to erase\n\nAnd cross off the days\n\n\n\nSo black out and hide behind the lines\n\nKeep staring down the sun and hope the\n\nLight will finally blind your eyes, it's the end\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\n\n\nCutting you free\n\nThe phantom that was part of me\n\nYou have lived, you have lost\n\nThe separation's worth the cost\n\n\n\nHeavy are the voices that go unspoken (spoken)\n\nHeavy are the promises now broken (broken)\n\n\n\nWell you burn below the chased\n\nUpon destruction in your wake\n\nCross off the days\n\n\n\nSo black out and hide behind the lines\n\nKeep staring down the sun and hope the\n\nLight will finally blind your eyes, it's the end\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\nCross off the days gone\n\n\n\nGone by\n\n\n\nMaking my way back from the madness\n\nShooting my thoughts through the blackness\n\nAnd the sadness, but the fact is\n\nI'm shooting through words like a clenched fist\n\nFuck sanity, I wanna bleed\n\nCan't kill the pain\n\nIt's everything\n\nIt's all I feel\n\nIt's what I breathe\n\nThrough the hate I breathe into what I need\n\n\n\nHeavy is the hand that points the finger (finger)\n\nHeavy is the heart that's filled with anger (anger)\n\n\n\nDid you survey everything you laid to waste\n\nYou cross off the days\n\n\n\nSo black out and hide behind the lines\n\nKeep staring down the sun and hope the\n\nLight will finally blind your eyes, it's the end\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\nCross off the days gone by\n\nCross off the days gone by",
