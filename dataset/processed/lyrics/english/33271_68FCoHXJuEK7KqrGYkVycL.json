  "lyrics": "I'm high on the neon\r\nChasing the greens, the blues, the reds\r\nI keep touching the ceiling\r\nBut my feelings, they fall for you, instead\r\nYou're death in a black dress\r\nI'm the puppet that's hanging from your thread\n\nYou're the name of my madness\n\nI don't want to get you out of my head\n\n\n\nGimme the heartbreak\n\nGimme the heartbreak\n\nBring on the hurt, Put in the work\n\nBaby don't try to fight it\n\nTell me you want me\n\nWhile you push and you shove me\n\nYou're pulling me close it's getting out of control\n\nAnd you know that I like it\n\n\n\nIt's an instant reaction\n\nYou're like the drug inside my vein\n\nAnother welcome distraction\n\nOne more shot of Novocaine\n\nYou're death in a black dress\n\nI'm the puppet that's hanging from your string\n\nYou're my favorite madness\n\nNo, I don't want to change a thing\n\n\n\nBaby don't try to fight it\n\nÂ‘Cause you know that I like it",
