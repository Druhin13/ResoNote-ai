  "lyrics": "You tell my heart, it's time to let go\r\nI can't be free, in the bindings of this world\r\nYou burn my soul!\r\nAnd whisper for me to come back home\r\nI'm letting go, brave surrender\n\nI'm taking hold, of life eternal\n\nOn the other side, I will find You\n\nLeaving my fears behind\n\nBrave surrender!\n\n\n\nChoosing to believe, for a freedom unknown\n\nFallling to my knees, I can't win this on my own\n\nHope is alive!\n\nYou've given me new eyes to see like You\n\n\n\nI'm letting go, brave surrender\n\nI'm taking hold, of life eternal\n\nOn the other side, I will find You\n\nLeaving my fears behind\n\nBrave surrender\n\n\n\nI'm running, not stopping\n\nStraight into Your arms\n\nYou're closer, I hear You\n\nYour voice cuts through the dark\n\nI'm running, not stopping\n\nStraight into Your arms\n\nYou're closer, I hear You\n\nYour voice cuts through the dark!\n\n\n\nI'm letting go, brave surrender\n\nI'm taking hold, of life eternal\n\nOn the other side, I will find You\n\nLeaving my fears behind\n\nBrave surrender\n\n\n\nOh! I'm letting go\n\nOh, I'm letting go\n\nO-o-o-oh\n\nOn the other side, I will find You\n\nLeaving my fears behind\n\nBrave surrender\n\nYou tell my heart, it's time to let go",
