  "lyrics": "Yeah\r\nIt's been a really long time\r\nI've grown up a lot and I'm tryna be different, I hope that you noticed it too\r\nI'm not as angry as I used to be when I started to rap and was broken in two\r\nNothin' was sweeter to me than ideas of bein' more than someone nobody knew\n\nMaybe cause nobody knew what I been through and it was too hard and I told them the truth\n\nIf you knew what I was thinkin' about, it was harder to suppress all the anger\n\nYellin' at the microphone was the only way I was able to [?] with these changes\n\nI know you wanted to see me portrayed in a way that I barely could hang with\n\nTellin' me it's hard to mess with me now that I'm doin' better and I'm virtually painless\n\nBut when I was down in the gutter knew everybody that had ever come around me had it like that\n\nI cracked under the white light, define that\n\nTime passed by and I finally got the mind back\n\nDidn't really wanna be the one to do it, but you knew I was doin' it [?]\n\nAll I know is I ain't done with the flow any moment I'm goin' to show you what I know and bring it right back\n\nAnd some of you really believe that an artist just isn't entitled to change\n\nI think it's just a deflection of your own rejection of copin' with life in these ways\n\nBut freakier to me, if people to talk about you [with they necks in your face?]\n\nI always pretend I don't see it cause it's even sharper to know there's a knife in your way\n\nWhy you gonna piss an elephant off [?]\n\nI don't even kill 'em in real life, but push it and you will see somebody rise\n\nAnd I know that there's somebody in me I don't wanna be and I keep it inside\n\nBut still I it, believe that everybody's got a limit and no one's [?]\n\nIt's gonna get ugly in here!\n\nEverything that I been bottling up is about to ignite\n\nBetter here me, yeah!\n\nYou will now know that if I'm goin' down then it's down with a fight\n\nFor every tongue I ever bite, every lyric that I don't recite\n\nI'm tired of hidin' the way that I feel to make somebody feel as if they wanna like me\n\nI ain't about that life!\n\nLook in my eyes, I've had an epiphany\n\nMemory playin' to me like a symphony\n\nTappin' in to it, I remember vividly\n\nWhat I was doin' it for\n\nIt is for me\n\nIt is therapeutic listening\n\nI ain't listening to anybody but me, when I write I'm gonna write my history, come on!\n\nI don't believe in what anybody wanna tell me that they never been into me and I really hate lies\n\nMaybe I'm cynical, I get minimal intervals with another human being every day of my life\n\nI don't wanna be nice, and I don't wanna be a buddy-buddy at a price\n\nAll I wanna do is celebrate it when I rise, and give anybody I love a really good life\n\nIt's funny I dropped out of school, wouldn't you know it I thought I was cool\n\nBut if I'm bein' honest, I blame it on my inability for me to follow the rules\n\nDidn't do it so I could be told what to do in my music and coddle you fools\n\nI won't pretend to be anyone other than me anymore, I don't wanna be used\n\nAnd that's probably not what you wanted to hear\n\nDon't follow me, I'm no role model, that's clear\n\nI got them issues\n\nI'm tryna accept that\n\nI don't wanna befriend you if aren't able to get that\n\nI'm on a mission to soul search\n\nI am aware that the globe hurts\n\nI don't know where I'ma find me, but when I do I'ma prob'ly have no words\n\nI don't believe I have no purpose\n\nDiggin' it up in the cold earth\n\nI was [?] I'm livin' in pain, and later my flow birth from go first",
