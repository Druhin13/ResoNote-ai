  "lyrics": "I remiss, I admit it\r\nI'm addicted to anything that's not good for me, mmm\r\nAnd I'm spending my time thinking, \"Who the hell is she in your arms smilin'?\"\r\nI know you're afraid from what you want but I've been curious\r\nDo I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nWhen you're kissing her\n\nTouching her, staring in her eyes\n\nTell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nWhen you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine\n\nTell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nMind, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nHypocrite, I'll admit it\n\n'Cause it's not like I've been spending my nights alone\n\nBut I can't stop wondering if you're there at home\n\nWakin' up inside her\n\nAnd does she feel the way I felt under you?\n\n\n\nDo I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nWhen you're kissing her\n\nTouching her, staring in her eyes\n\nTell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nWhen you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine\n\nTell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nMind, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nOh, it's just jealousy that keeps me up at night\n\nWhen you're runnin' through my mind\n\nI know you feel the same, tell me that I'm right\n\nDo I ever, oh\n\nDo I ever, ever, ever, ever\n\n\n\nDo I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nWhen you're kissing her\n\nTouching her, staring in her eyes\n\nTell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\nWhen you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine\n\nTell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\nMind, oh, oh, oh",
