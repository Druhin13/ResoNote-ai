  "lyrics": "Jesus was an Atheist\r\nHe was a friend of mine\r\nWe hooked up in temple\r\nBack in Roman Palestine\r\nWe became friends\r\nIt was the best of both worlds\n\nI was good at stealing silver\n\nHe was good at bullyin' girls\n\n\n\nHe said they're going to kill me\n\nWhen we go out smokin'\n\nI thought he meant the cigarettes\n\nBut Jesus wasn't jokin'\n\n\n\nMary was a pragmatist\n\nAnd virgin rolled in one\n\nOne day she said to Joseph\n\n\"Joe, I think the time has come\n\nYour boy needs to get a job\n\nTry the laundromat\"\n\nJoseph said, \"he ain't my boy\n\nI think we settled that\"\n\nMary said something about\n\nSemantics with a smile\n\nJoe said, \"I'm going drinkin'\n\nI'll be back in a little while\"\n\n\n\nI heard somebody say\n\nJesus was a Capricorn\n\nJesus told me once\n\nOn the day he was born\n\nA giant super nova exploded in the sky\n\nHe said he didn't know\n\nWhat it was supposed to signify\n\nI lost touch with him\n\nAnd he lost touch with me\n\nThe next thing I remember\n\nHe was big in Galilee\n\n\n\nWe were walkin' in the desert\n\nTrading big hits from a bong\n\nThey said it was 40 days\n\nIt didn't seem that long\n\nI was trying to talk him out\n\nOf such a pointless sacrifice\n\nHe said it was the only way\n\nHe got to paradise\n\nI said, \"You might be high\"\n\nHe said I was mistaken\n\nBut watching him die\n\nWas truly heartbreakin'\n\n\n\nJesus descended\n\nI guess you'd call it that\n\nI'm down here, baby\n\nWhat the hell you lookin' at?\n\nI sometimes wonder if we'd stay friends\n\nHow am I to change the way\n\nThis party ends?\n\nI know you all believe\n\nThat Jesus was divine\n\nJesus was an atheist\n\nHe was a friend of mine",
