  "lyrics": "Standing on the mountain looking down on the city\r\nThe way I feel is a doggone pity.\r\nTeardrops falling down a mountainside\r\nMany times I've been here\r\nMany times I've cried\r\nWe used to be so happy\n\nWhen we were in love\n\nHigh on a mountain of love.\n\n\n\nNight after night I've been standing here alone\n\nWeeping my heart out to cold gray dawn\n\nPraying that you're lonely and you'll come here too\n\nHoping just by chance that I get a glimpse of you\n\nTrying hard to find you\n\nSomewhere I love\n\nHigh on a mountain of love.\n\n\n\nA mountain of love\n\nA mountain of love\n\nYou should be ashamed\n\nWe used to be a mountain of love\n\nBut you just changed your name\n\n\n\nWay down below there's a half a million people\n\nSomewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple\n\nInside a church there's an altar filled with flowers\n\nWedding bells are ringing and they should have been ours\n\nThat's why I'm so lonely\n\nMy dreams gone above\n\nHigh on a mountain of love.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mountain of love\n\nA mountain of love\n\nYou should be ashamed\n\nWe used to be a mountain of love\n\nBut you just changed your name\n\n\n\nWay down below there's a half a million people\n\nSomewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple\n\nInside a church there's an altar filled with flowers\n\nWedding bells are ringing that should have been ours\n\nThat's why I'm so lonely\n\nMy dreams gone above\n\nHigh on a mountain of love.\n\n\n\nHigh on a mountain of love.\n\nHigh on a mountain of love.\n\nHigh on a mountain of love",
