Lord God Almighty!\r\nEarly in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;\r\nHoly, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!\r\nGod in three Persons, blessed Trinity!\r\nHoly, holy, holy! All the saints adore Thee\n\nCasting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;\n\nCherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee\n\nWhich were, and are, and evermore shall be\n\n\n\nHoly, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!\n\nAll Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth, and sky, and sea;\n\nHoly, holy, holy; merciful and mighty!\n\nGod in three Persons, blessed Trinity!",
