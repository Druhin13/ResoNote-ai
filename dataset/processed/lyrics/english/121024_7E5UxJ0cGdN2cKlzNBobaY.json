  "lyrics": "Early in the morning when the sun does rise\r\nLaying in the bed with blood shot eyes\r\nLate in the evening when the sun sinks low\r\nWell that's about time my rooster crows\r\nI've got women up and down this creek\n\nWhere to keep me going and my engine clean\n\nRun me ragged but I don't fret\n\nCause there ain't been nothing slow me down just yet\n\n\n\nGet me drinking that moonshine\n\nGet me higher than a grocery bill\n\nTake my troubles to the high wall\n\nThrow them in the river and get your fill\n\n\n\nWe been sniffing that cocaine\n\nAnd no better feeling when the wind cuts cold\n\nLord its mighty hard living\n\nBut a damn good feeling to run these roads\n\n\n\nI got people trying to tell me Red\n\nKeep this living and you wind up dead\n\nCast your troubles on the lord of lords\n\nWind up lying on the cooling board\n\n\n\nBut I got buddies up at white house road\n\nThey keep me strutting when my feet hang low\n\nRot gut whiskey gonna ease my pain\n\nAnd all this running gonna keep me sane\n\n\n\nGet me drinking that moonshine\n\nGet me higher than a grocery bill\n\nTake my troubles to the high wall\n\nThrow them in the river and get your fill\n\n\n\nWe been sniffing that cocaine\n\nAnd no better feeling when the wind cuts cold\n\nLord its mighty hard living\n\nBut a damn good feeling to run these roads\n\nDamn good feeling to run these roads\n\n\n\nWhen they lay me in the cold hard clay\n\nSinging them hymns while the banjo plays\n\nTell those ladies that they ought not frown\n\nCause there ain't been nothing ever held me down\n\nWell the lawman, women or a shallow grave\n\nSame old blues just a different day\n\n\n\nGet me drinking that moonshine\n\nGet me higher than a grocery bill\n\nTake my troubles to the high wall\n\nThrow them in the river and get your fill\n\n\n\nWe been sniffing that cocaine\n\nAnd no better feeling when the wind cuts cold\n\nLord its mighty hard living\n\nBut a damn good feeling to run these roads\n\nDamn good feeling to run these roads\n\nDamn good feeling to run these roads\n\nDamn good feeling to run these roads",
