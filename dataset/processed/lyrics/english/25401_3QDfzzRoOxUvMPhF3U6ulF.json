  "lyrics": "Some shit just don't rub you right when you first hear about it\r\nI'm looking at the Freshman List, your name ain't on the ballot, man\r\nI'm looking at the piece on my side, I can't go nowhere without it\r\nPeople always tryna run up on somebody, get some clout, and\r\nI've been in and in and out the bank, in and out the bank\r\nWonder what my mind is on, it's not what you think\n\nI'm blowing out the big gas, all I smoke is dank\n\nThese rappers tryna formulate, I love this shit, I fornicate\n\nI'm playing with the kitty, finger fucking on the money\n\nEvery blunt cost me a check, like I'm smoking out a hunnid\n\nSorry bae, wanna come 'round, but this here Ferrari play\n\nMeaning every sixty seconds, I go so, so far away\n\nI'm a pimp in every sense of the word, dog, ya heard\n\nHow I met this girl on fourth of July, but fucked her on the third?\n\nHow I feel like DJ Khaled? I got all my bags secured\n\nHow I went and grew some wings when all my dogs was pitching birds?\n\n\n\nAye, aye, aye, yea\n\nNothing that you gon' do ever gonna stay, aye, yea\n\nAnd I've been going through it, so I'm tryna get this cake, aye, yea\n\nNothing that you gon' do ever gonna stay, aye, yea",
