  "lyrics": "I watched you sleep last night only for a moment, that's all\r\nIt was bittersweet when I gently kissed your shoulder\r\nAnd in a moment it was over\r\nThat's what your nose said when I read it this morning\r\nSaid you know I was going but a year on the road and\r\nYou needed more than a moment with me\n\nEverything golden, glitter and diamonds\n\nBut I can't keep holding on to this cruel fantasy\n\nWhen you knew that I would drink your bathwater\n\nBeat the pussy all the way up to the pedestal\n\nThought about just for you, no lie, never lie\n\nI would've been faithful, do that for us\n\n'Cause everybody deserves trust, sometimes\n\n\n\nMaybe in another life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life, ooh\n\nMaybe in another life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life, yeah\n\n\n\nI felt you leave last night\n\nI thought I was dreaming, that's all\n\nWas all too real when I opened my eyes\n\nAnd saw your letter on a pillow\n\nBut I had a feeling it was coming, oh\n\nI know I was going but a year on the road and\n\nAnd I knew that you needed more than just a moment of love\n\nAnything, everything golden, glitter and diamonds\n\nBut I can't keep holding you to this cruel fantasy, ooh\n\nMaybe in another life we might collide\n\nAnd then the stars would align again\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nMaybe in another time we would be bound\n\nAnd then our love would be found again\n\nAnother life\n\n\n\nMaybe in another life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nMaybe in another life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life, another life\n\n\n\nMaybe in another life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nMaybe in another life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life\n\n\n\nAnother life, another life\n\nAnother life, another life",
