  "title": "Suspirium",
  "lyrics": "This is a waltz thinking about our bodies\r\nWhat they mean for our salvation\r\nWith only the clothes that we stand up in\r\nJust the ground on which we stand\r\nIs the darkness ours to take?\r\nBathed in lightness, bathed in heat\n\n\n\nAll is well, as long as we keep spinning\n\nHere and now, dancing behind a wall\n\nWhen the old songs and laughter we do\n\nAre forgiven always and never been true\n\n\n\nWhen I arrive, will you come and find me?\n\nOr in a crowd, be one of them?\n\nWore the wrong sign back beside her\n\nKnow tomorrow's at peace",
