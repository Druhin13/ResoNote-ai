Alright\n\n\n\nOkay, how can I do this\n\nSomeone's got a body, the sober can't manoeuvre\n\nYeah, I wanna stay, but I don't want to fight\n\nHere's a few, like, we were doing alright\n\nThen we got older, not good\n\nNobody does, what they told you they would\n\nDid what I should and what I was told\n\nKept my whole time, my eyes half closed\n\n\n\nThey've got control of you, soldier\n\nPut you in the field with a gun to shoot and kill more\n\nJust play your part, little solider\n\nMarchin' left, right, left, right\n\n\n\nI wanna walk like me, I wanna talk like me\n\nI don't wanna, I don't wanna be another, no\n\nI wanna walk like me, I wanna talk like me\n\nNo, I don't wanna be another, no\n\n\n\nI've been fighting to the desert\n\nThe summer will be cold, yeah\n\nUndecided but I never really even showed, but it's so tempting\n\n\n\nI wanna walk like me, I wanna talk like me\n\nI don't wanna, I don't wanna be another, no\n\nI wanna walk like me, I wanna talk like me\n\nNo, I don't wanna be another, no\n\n\n\nYou won't sleep on us\n\nIf you sleep on us\n\nYeah, I should be there with you\n\nSorry, I forgot",
