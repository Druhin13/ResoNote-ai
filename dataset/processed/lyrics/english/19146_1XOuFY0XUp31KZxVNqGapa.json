  "lyrics": "In your darkest moments\r\nNever forget that you can\r\nAnd will make it through\r\nNever forget the hard times\r\nThat you already have\r\nMade it through\n\n\n\nAnd understand that in the future\n\nThere will be more challenges\n\nBut also more rewards\n\nAnd all of this counts as life\n\nIt’s all part of true joy\n\nEverything counts\n\n\n\nAfter all, these ups and downs\n\nAren’t here to hurt us\n\nThey’re here to thrill us\n\nTo make the rollercoaster ride of life\n\nEven more interesting\n\nAnd spectacular\n\n\n\nDeep down inside\n\nWe don’t really want an easy life\n\nWe want an amazing life\n\nAnd the strength to love it\n\nWith all our heart\n\n\n\nBesides, darkness and shadow\n\nThose are not our enemies\n\nThey’re as necessary and natural\n\nAs the nighttime is to the day\n\nThe dark isn’t bad\n\nIt’s simply the light casting a shadow\n\n\n\nOur ultimate quest is not to destroy\n\nThe shadows or our demons\n\nBut to learn to hold hands\n\nWith that side of life\n\nTo party with our demons",
