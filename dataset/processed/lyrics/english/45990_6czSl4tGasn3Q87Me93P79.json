  "lyrics": "I walk to the echo of stars\r\nAll around me, under me\r\nA bed made of curious cloth\r\nA pillow from a crib\r\nThe skies are dark, all of them\n\nStill comforting starlight\n\nPouring all over this new home\n\nHigh above\n\n\n\nYounger than yesterday\n\nI feel no pain, no memory lost\n\nAlone yet with everything\n\nWhat is this space?\n\n\n\nGoodnight to an old soul\n\nGoodbye to life once lived\n\nThis is my island now\n\nTo live it once more\n\nNot long now\n\nThis time, this weightless fall\n\nThe calming mothers call\n\nBack in time; I'm cleansed and bare\n\nAnd I see the light\n\nNow I know\n\n\n\nThey left me with a softest bed\n\nA whitest cloth for a waiting dead\n\nA light to pride and the frequent night\n\nAn apple for a thirsty bite\n\nA clean slate, a newborn mind\n\nBrightest blue, purple moon\n\nLife once lived now understood\n\nHigh above\n\n\n\nTonight I will make the leap\n\nDeep down to the night unknown\n\nThat's why they put me here\n\nThey, they...\n\n\n\nGoodnight to an old soul\n\nGoodbye to life once lived\n\nThis is my island now\n\nTo live it once more\n\nNot long now\n\n\n\nThis time, this weightless fall\n\nThe calming mothers call\n\nBack in time; I'm cleansed and bare\n\nAnd I see the light\n\nNow I know\n\nGoodnight to an old soul\n\nGoodbye to life once lived\n\nThis is my island now\n\nAnd live it once more\n\nNot long now\n\nThis time, this weightless fall\n\nThe calming mothers call\n\nBack in time; I'm cleansed and bare\n\nAnd I see the light\n\nNow I know",
