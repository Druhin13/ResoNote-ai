  "lyrics": "She's sick of this town, she's sick of that boy\r\nYeah she's sick of dreams that never take flight\r\nThere's gotta be more than the same old story\r\nSo she's gonna turn the page tonight\r\nAnd turn the radio up (turn the radio up)\r\nRoll the windows down\n\nShe got a full tank of gas (she got a full tank of gas)\n\nAin't no stopping her now\n\n\n\nShe's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,\n\nYeah, the only thing that's left to do\n\nIs catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes\n\nAre leaving nothing in that rearview\n\nBut dust, nothing but dust\n\n\n\nShe's fighting back tears, she's fighting back years\n\nOf the only life she's ever known\n\nThere's a future that's bright in the dead of this night,\n\nAnd all she's gotta do is go\n\nAnd turn the radio up (turn the radio up)\n\nRoll the windows down\n\nShe got an open road (she got an open road)\n\nAin't no stopping her now\n\n\n\nShe's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,\n\nYeah, the only thing that's left to do\n\nIs catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes\n\nAre leaving nothing in that rearview\n\nBut dust, nothing but dust\n\n(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\n\n\nShe got the radio up,\n\nShe got the windows down,\n\nNo she won't look back\n\nAin't no stopping her,\n\nAin't no stopping her nowÂ…\n\n\n\nShe's got the pedal to the floor in a hand-me-down Ford,\n\nYeah, the only thing that's left to do\n\nIs catch a couple green lights and those baby blue eyes\n\nAre leaving nothing in that rearview\n\nBut dust, nothing but dust\n\nDust, nothing but dust\n\n(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)\n\n(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)",
