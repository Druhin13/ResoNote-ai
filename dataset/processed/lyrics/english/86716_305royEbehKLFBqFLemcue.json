  "lyrics": "Come and talk, \nOf all the things we did today,\r\nHere and laugh, \nAbout our funny little ways,\r\nWhile we have, \nA few minutes to breathe,\n\nAnd I know that it's time, \n\nYou must leave,\n\nBut, darling, be home soon,\n\nI couldn't bear to wait, \n\nAn extra minute if you dawdled,\n\nMy darling, be home soon,\n\nIt's not just these few hours, \n\nBut I've been waiting since I toddled,\n\nFor the great relief, \n\nOf having you to talk to. \n\nAnd now, a quarter of my life, \n\nHas almost passed,\n\nI think I've come to see myself at last,\n\nAnd I see that the time spent confused,\n\nWas the time that I spent without you,\n\nAnd I feel myself in bloom.\n\nSo, darling, my darling, be home soon,\n\nI couldn't bear to wait, \n\nAn extra minute if you dawdled,\n\nMy darling, be home soon,\n\nIt's not just these few hours, \n\nBut I've been waiting since I toddled, \n\nFor the great relief, \n\nOf having you to talk to. \n\nGo and beat your crazy head, \n\nAgainst the sky,\n\nTry and see beyond, \n\nThe houses and your eyes,\n\nIt's ok to shoot the moon.",
