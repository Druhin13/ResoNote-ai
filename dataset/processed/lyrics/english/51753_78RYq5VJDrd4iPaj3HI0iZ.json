  "lyrics": "Silhouettes on the bedroom walls\r\nMemories of alcohol and countless cigarettes\r\nIt’s 3am and he can’t close his eyes\r\nWatches traffic passing by and will stay there most of the night\r\nHe’s counting cars by the window again\n\nLosing sleep to stop the world from turning\n\n\n\nI’ve got a feeling that he’s been dreaming\n\nThat one day you’re coming home\n\nHe leaves the door unlocked in hope\n\nBecause he’s dreaming that he’s got a feeling\n\nSometimes lies keep you alive\n\nHe’ll be waiting every night\n\n\n\nHe took the mirrors off the bedroom walls\n\nPainted pictures in the halls because “you’ll come back one day”\n\nA broken heart still beats just twice as slow\n\nLost the other half 2 months ago, and since he’s never been the same\n\n\n\nHe’s counting cars by the window again\n\n\n\nI’ve got a feeling that he’s been dreaming\n\nThat one day you’re coming home\n\nHe leaves the door unlocked in hopes\n\nBecause he’s dreaming that he’s got a feeling\n\nSometimes lies keep you alive\n\nHe’ll be counting cars tonight\n\n\n\nThe window broke, the coldness forced its way into his home\n\nHe remembered everything and lost the hope he believed in\n\nHe’s a mess in distress, nothings left in his chest\n\nClosed his eyes, held his breathe\n\n\n\nAnd he’s dreaming, forever dreaming that he’d protected her that night\n\nSo if he could turn back time then he’d drive sober and forever hold her\n\nNow he watches cars go by and hope one day he’ll see her lights",
