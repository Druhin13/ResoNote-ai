  "lyrics": "I'm ruining moments, I’m losing my focus\r\nGauging damage you could brew\r\nAnd wondering what comes after you\r\nThat's when you kiss me, and that's when I’m thinking\r\nI should memorize the taste in case it ever goes away\n\nSo all I'm asking is be careful what you promise\n\nYou still got time to change your mind, so just be honest\n\n\n\nIf you think that you might leave me\n\nWhy don't you say it? Why don't you say it?\n\nIf you think you might not need me\n\nWhy don't you sing it? Why don't you say it?\n\n\n\nI'm pulling you close, and I picture you go\n\nIn my attempt to keep you here, I manifest the things I fear\n\nIf you change your mind, then I'll realize\n\nI’ve grown around an emptiness\n\nLike a tree that’s grown around a fence\n\n\n\nSo all I'm asking is be careful what you promise\n\nYou still got time to change your mind, so just be honest\n\n\n\nIf you think that you might leave me\n\nWhy don’t you say it? Why don't you say it?\n\nIf you think you might not need me\n\nWhy don't you sing it? Why don't you say it?\n\n\n\nOoh, say it, why don’t you say it?\n\nOoh, say it, why don't you say it?\n\n\n\nSay it, come on and say it\n\nSay it, come on and say it\n\nSay it, come on and say it\n\nSay it, come on and say it\n\nSay it, come on and say it",
