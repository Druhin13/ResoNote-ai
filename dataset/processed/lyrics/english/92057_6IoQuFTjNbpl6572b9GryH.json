  "lyrics": "Let's wrap a blanket around us\r\nAnd go flyin' into outer space\r\nWe could be famous\r\nSpeak a different language\r\nMake our great escape\n\nI'll chase the stars inside your eyes\n\nAnd follow you into the great unknown\n\nWe'll be alone\n\n\n\nSo let's just play pretend\n\nAnd find a secret place\n\nWhen the world around us says\n\nThat we should act our age\n\nThe day is gonna come\n\nWhen there's no time left to waste\n\nBut we'll never grow up\n\nI say we hide away\n\n\n\nAnd build a city\n\nSomething out of nothing\n\nMake this place our home\n\nOur home\n\nStay in make-believe\n\nAnd we'll go disappearing\n\nWho would ever know?\n\n\n\n\n\nJust want to hide away\n\nHide away, hide away\n\nHide away, hide away\n\nI'll never grow up\n\nJust want to hide away\n\nHide away, hide away\n\nHide away, hide away\n\n\n\nThe day is gonna come\n\nWhen there's no time left to waste\n\nBut we'll never grow up\n\nI say we hide away\n\nDon't make me grow up\n\nI say we hide away",
