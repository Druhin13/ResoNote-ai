  "lyrics": "The hardest thing I have learned is I can't help myself\r\nIf I can't trust my worth\r\nAnd I can't trust my words\r\nAccepting is not my fault but I'm the one to blame\r\nAnd know I've got to change\r\nNo I'm not ashamed\n\n\n\nYou've been there for all of my crimes\n\nYou've given me all of your time\n\nYou've shown me theres flaws in blue skies\n\nOnly you, only you\n\n\n\nSo don't you wonder why\n\nI can't say goodbye\n\nI won't even cry\n\nThere always is tomorrow\n\nI, I can't sleep at night\n\nI can't even cry\n\nThere always is tomorrow\n\n\n\nPatiently there for me when I'm forced to the edge\n\nAlways in my head to get out of your bed\n\nBut no one can understand confusion like I do\n\nThese blue days are my true\n\nThere's silence in my room\n\n\n\nYou've been there for all of my crimes\n\nOnly you, only you\n\n\n\nSo don't you wonder why\n\nI can't say goodbye\n\nI won't even cry\n\nThere always is tomorrow\n\nI can't sleep at night\n\nI did it every time\n\nThere always is tomorrow\n\n\n\nAnd I said what I said\n\nDo you believe me, do I know who I am\n\nDo you believe me, that I won't do you wrong\n\nThere a lot I've known all along\n\nBy finding myself I nearly lost 'em all\n\nBy fighting It all thought I knew it all\n\nI'm lying alone and now I know I it all\n\n\n\nSo don't you wonder why\n\nI can't say goodbye\n\nI won't even cry\n\nThere always is tomorrow\n\nI can't sleep at night\n\nI won't even cry\n\nThere always is tomorrow\n\n\n\nSo ready or not, here I come, you can't hide\n\nI'm gonna find you and make you want me\n\nReady or not, here I come\n\nI'm gonna find you and make you want me",
