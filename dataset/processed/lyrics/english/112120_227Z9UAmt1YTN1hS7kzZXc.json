  "lyrics": "Will you surrender? Restless in a war, war...\r\nWe're sailling, farewell love\r\nWe praise our shared destiny\r\nBe sure to embrace the dreams\r\nI'm more than a dead and gone\n\n... close your eyes...\n\n\n\nI see the past of the time passing fast\n\nThe present's over and gone\n\nSo know I'm ready, I trust my soul\n\nI'm hoping to fly with style, we shall know\n\n\n\nTrust in me and set me free\n\nYou're hiding your love\n\nI don't wish to try this alone\n\nI feel lone, why shouldn't I go?\n\nCause even the time we're so longing gets blown\n\nI feel I tried\n\nI feel so alone\n\nOne day we'll say it to the glow\n\nI dream so too...\n\n\n\nThe dreams turn alive in the heavens\n\n\n\nWe surrender restless in a war, war...",
