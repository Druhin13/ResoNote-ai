  "lyrics": "They keep asking me if I'm okay, ain't shit okay\r\nI've been hurt my whole life\r\nI lost my best friend\r\nMy mud brother and my blood brother, all in one\r\nI cannot heal all this pain when I'm constantly hurt\n\nThat's why I hope for the best but I prepare for the worst\n\nFeel like my whole life a cell, I tend to go through the most\n\nI've been trapped up in the dark and I don't know where the door\n\n\n\nWhat you know about pain? (uhh)\n\nTired of goin' through all this pain (I'm tired of goin' through all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know, what you know?)\n\nTired of holdin' all this pain (I'm tired of holdin' all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know 'bout pain?)\n\nTired of goin' through all this pain (I'm tired of goin' through all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know 'bout this pain?)\n\nTired of holdin' all this pain (I'm tired of holdin' all this pain)\n\n\n\nStarted back when I was younger, beatin' on, child abuse\n\nI fell victim to the the streets, I'm tired of hearin' the rent was due\n\nIn and out of sticky situations, back and forth in altercations\n\nAnd I lost my life to these streets (I swear I lost)\n\nI lost three brothers, how the hell I'ma tell they mamas? (how the fuck I'ma do that?)\n\nI tend to fault myself sometimes\n\nLike how the fuck I get caught slippin'? (how?)\n\nAnd why I wasn't on my pivot?\n\nLike damn I'm the reason why they missin'\n\nLookin' around and it blood everywhere (I swear it's blood everywhere)\n\nIt's tears fallin' but it's blood every tear (I swear it's blood every tear)\n\nLookin' around and it blood everywhere (I swear it's blood everywhere)\n\nIt's tears fallin' but it's blood every tear\n\n\n\nI cannot heal all this pain when I'm constantly hurt\n\nThat's why I hope for the best but I prepare for the worst\n\nFeel like my whole life a cell, I tend to go through the most\n\nI've been trapped up in the dark and I don't know where the door\n\n\n\nWhat you know about pain? (ayy)\n\nTired of goin' through all this pain (I'm tired of goin' through all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know, what you know?)\n\nTired of holdin' all this pain (I'm tired of holdin' all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (uh, what you know?)\n\nTired of goin' through all this pain (I'm tired of goin' through all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know about this pain?)\n\nTired of holdin' all this pain (I'm tired of holdin' all this pain inside)\n\n\n\nSee I was lost tryna find, like how the fuck I lose myself?\n\nI'm surrounded by the fakes, seem to only love they self\n\nIn this world you play for keeps, every man for they self\n\nHow the fuck you gon' be loyal to me when you ain't loyal to yourself?\n\nWhole lot up on my mind, can I vent sometime?\n\nSeem like I always lose but can I win sometime?\n\nI've been tryin' to keep my distance\n\nEverybody say I'm actin' different\n\nI don't give a fuck bitch, can you feel the pain I'm feelin'?\n\nGoin' through the storm, can you feel the rain that's hittin'?\n\nWhole life a livin' hell, imagine the life I'm livin'\n\nSo much shit up on the line that I sacrafice\n\nI'm tired of cryin', why we all gotta die?\n\n\n\nI cannot heal all this pain when I'm constantly hurt\n\nThat's why I hope for the best but I prepare for the worst\n\nFeel like my whole life a cell, I tend to go through the most\n\nI've been trapped up in the dark and I don't know where the door\n\n\n\nWhat you know about pain? (whoa-oh)\n\nTired of goin' through all this pain (I'm tired of goin' through all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know about this pain?)\n\nTired of holdin' all this pain (I'm tired of holdin' all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know, what you know?)\n\nTired of goin' through all this pain (I'm tired of goin' through all this pain)\n\nWhat you know 'bout pain? (what you know about this pain?)\n\nTired of holdin' all this pain (I'm tired of holdin' all this pain)",
