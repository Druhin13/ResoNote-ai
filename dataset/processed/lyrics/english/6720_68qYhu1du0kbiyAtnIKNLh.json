  "lyrics": "Say no more, I was yours\r\nWhen your silence came over me\r\nHead to toe, danger zone\r\nYou're afraid to throw away the key\r\nTell all your friends\n\nCover your losses on my expense\n\nTell all your friends\n\nWhy we burn at both ends\n\n\n\nBrief collisions in the passing lane\n\nYour turning signals light me up but nothing's changed\n\nRed tape, silver lines\n\nTough breaks, working overtime\n\nIs there something that you're looking for?\n\nIt's hard to tell when your ear's against the door\n\nNice shot, old flame\n\nCan't stop, but nothing lasts forever\n\n\n\nSay it matters\n\nIf it ain't from the heart then it ain't from me\n\nSay it matters\n\nYour secret is safe when you're close to me\n\nSay it matters\n\nAnd know that I'm touched but you're out of reach\n\nTell all your friends\n\nWhy we burn at both ends\n\n\n\nBrief collisions in the passing lane\n\nYour turning signals light me up but nothing's changed\n\nRed tape, silver lines\n\nTough breaks, working overtime\n\nIs there something that you're looking for?\n\nIt's hard to tell when your ear's against the door\n\nRed dots, white wine\n\nSafe sex, fighting all the time\n\n\n\nBrief collisions in the passing lane (Say it matters)\n\nYour turning signals light me up but nothing's changed (Say it matters)\n\nRed tape, silver lines (Say it matters)\n\nTough breaks, working overtime (Say it matters)\n\nIs there something that you're looking for? (Say it matters)\n\nIt's hard to tell when your ear's against the door (Say it matters)\n\nNice shot, old flame (Say it matters)\n\nCan't stop, but nothing lasts forever",
