  "lyrics": "Baby, can't you see I'm calling?\r\nA guy like you should wear a warning\r\nIt's dangerous, I'm falling\r\nThere's no escape, I can't wait\r\nI need a hit, baby, give me it\r\nYou're dangerous, I'm loving it\n\n\n\nToo high, can't come down\n\nLosing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round\n\n(Do you feel me now?)\n\n\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\n\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\n\n(With a taste of a poison paradise)\n\nI'm addicted to you\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nAnd I love what you do\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\n\n\nIt's getting late to give you up\n\nI took a sip from my devil's cup\n\nSlowly, it's taking over me\n\n\n\nToo high, can't come down\n\nIt's in the air and it's all around\n\n(Can you feel me now?)\n\n\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\n\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\n\n(With a taste of a poison paradise)\n\nI'm addicted to you\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nAnd I love what you do\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\n\n\nIntoxicate me now with your lovin' now\n\nI think I'm ready now\n\nIntoxicate me now with your lovin' now\n\nI think I'm ready now\n\n\n\nWith a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride\n\nYou're toxic, I'm slippin' under\n\n(With a taste of a poison paradise)\n\nI'm addicted to you\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nAnd I love what you do\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?\n\nI'm addicted to you\n\nDon't you know that you're toxic?",
