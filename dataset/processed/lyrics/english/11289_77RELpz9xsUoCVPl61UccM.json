(Hey, hey)\n\nWhat you gonna do in the next 2 minutes?\n\nGotta stay here, never say \"You finish?\"\n\nWhat you gonna do in the next 2 minutes?\n\n\n\nWhat you gonna do? What you gonna do?\n\nWhat you gonna do? What you gonna do?\n\nWhat you gonna do? What you gonna do?\n\n\n\nGotta stay here, never say \"You finish?\"\n\nWhat you gonna do in the next 2 minutes?\n\nWhat you gonna do in the next 2 minutes?",
