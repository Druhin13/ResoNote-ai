  "lyrics": "Looking from the window above\r\nIts like a story of love.\r\nCan you hear me?\r\nCame back only yesterday,\r\nMoving farther away.\r\nWant you near me.\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the love you gave.\n\nAll I needed for another day\n\nAnd all I ever knew;\n\nOnly you.\n\n\n\nSometimes when I think of her name\n\nWhen it's only a game\n\nAnd I need you.\n\nListen to the words that you say,\n\nIt's getting harder to stay\n\nWhen I see you.\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the love you gave.\n\nAll I needed for another day\n\nAnd all I ever knew;\n\nOnly you.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the love you gave.\n\nAll I needed for another day\n\nAnd all I ever knew;\n\nOnly you.\n\n\n\nThis is gonna take a long time\n\nAnd I wonder what's mine.\n\nCan't take no more. (Can't take no more)\n\nWonder if you'll understand\n\nIt's just the touch of your hand,\n\nBehind closed doors.\n\n\n\nAll I needed was the love you gave.\n\nAll I needed for another day\n\nAnd all I ever knew; (All I ever knew)\n\nOnly you.",
