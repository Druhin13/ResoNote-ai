  "lyrics": "You should've seen my cursive back then\r\nEvery letter was above the line\r\nMy Ps and Qs raised their stems\r\nSo nothing crossed beneath\r\nI'm a little better now\n\nYou never lifted your voice\n\nYou never raised your hand\n\nYou never showed me your inhuman\n\nYou understand\n\n\n\nArt gets what it wants and art gets what it deserves\n\n\n\nMost people are jokes but you’re so real\n\nMost of the time that I use the word “you”\n\nWell you know that I’m mostly singing about you\n\n\n\nYou swore you’d never use\n\nThe face that your ex invented\n\nSo let’s meet up in\n\nUncanny valley\n\n\n\nYou never lifted your voice\n\nYou never raised your hand\n\nI only show you my inhuman\n\nYou understand\n\n\n\nYou’ll get what you want and you’ll get what you deserve\n\nYou’ll get what you want and you’ll get what you deserve\n\n\n\nI'm a good person\n\nI'm a powerful person\n\nI don't believe in evil\n\nI think that evil is an idea created by others\n\nTo avoid dealing with their own nature\n\nI understand my own nature\n\nGood and evil have nothing to do with it\n\nI understand myself\n\nI control myself\n\nI control everything within myself\n\nMy domain is my domain\n\nI can lie on my back\n\nAnd affect the lives of those I love without moving\n\nBut I would only affect them in good ways\n\nI don't waste time on evil\n\nI'm a good person ...is this thing on?\n\nDo you know about a Jesus?\n\nDo you really know?\n\nAll you know is what you've been told\n\nListen with your heart\n\nSing with your heart\n\nYou've just been singing about girls, what do you know about girls?\n\nFuck, why are you so tense?\n\nYou've gotta start singing\n\nWith love in your heart\n\n...Is this on?\n\nAdam are you here?\n\nThe Pain Star has entered your house, but what are you going to do about it?\n\nAre you going to touch it?\n\nIt only once happens every 1000 years. Maybe even 2000 years\n\nAnd how long is a year, really?\n\nIt's almost Halloween. I haven't done shit this year\n\nIt's been a summer. It's been summer since February\n\nI was in Australia. God\n\nCalifornia? Then what?\n\nJune, July, August\n\nA month in Europe\n\nI can't even go to Ikea anymore, I've got flashbacks\n\nFuck\n\nYou should see the lights that I got there, I know you'd like them\n\n*Heavy breathing*\n\nI think you'd like them a lot\n\n*Sniffing*\n\n\n\nIsn't this where...",
