  "lyrics": "When I woke up you were gone\r\nAnd the sun was on the lawn\r\nEmpty pillow with perfume on\r\nI smelled it.\r\nWell, we met in my favorite bar\n\nTook a ride in my old car\n\nBut I still don't know how\n\nWe made it home.\n\n\n\nWas I too far gone\n\nToo far gone\n\nToo far gone\n\nFor you.\n\n\n\nWe had drugs and we had booze\n\nBut we still had something to lose\n\nAnd by dawn I wanted\n\nTo marry you.\n\n\n\nWith our attitudes by day\n\nAnd our secret dreams by night\n\nCan we really live our lives\n\nThat way.\n\n\n\nAm I too far gone\n\nToo far gone\n\nToo far gone\n\nFor you.\n\n\n\nWas I too far gone\n\nToo far gone\n\nToo far gone\n\nFor you.",
