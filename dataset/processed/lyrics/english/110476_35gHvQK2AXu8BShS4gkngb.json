  "lyrics": "Did you forget that I've got a thing called emotion?\r\nYou live and you let 'til you start to bleed\r\nHow would I know? 'Cause you left my wound wide open\r\nJust for how long will you let it bleed? Oh\r\nThe town we are from, the small-minded talk\n\nWe'd sing the songs with the lyrics all wrong\n\nInvested in love but now you feel broke\n\n'Cause shit didn't turn out the way that you hoped\n\nI get that you're hurt 'cause we don't spend time\n\nAs much as we used to but don't we all learn from mistakes?\n\nMhm\n\n\n\nDid you forget that I've got a thing called emotion?\n\nYou live and you let 'til you start to bleed\n\nHow would I know? 'Cause you left my wound wide open\n\nJust for how long will you let it bleed?\n\n\n\nDid you know the lies you would feed\n\nIn the end I'd start to believe in?\n\nDid you forget I've got a thing called emotion?\n\n\n\nWhy can't we talk it over?\n\nI just, I just don't get it\n\nWhy can't we talk it over?\n\n\n\nDid you forget that I've got a thing called emotion?\n\nYou live and you let 'til you start to bleed\n\nHow would I know? 'Cause you left my wound wide open\n\nJust for how long will you let it bleed? Oh\n\n\n\nDid you know the lies you would feed\n\nIn the end I'd start to believe in?\n\nDid you forget I've got a thing called emotion?",
