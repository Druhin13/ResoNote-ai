  "lyrics": "He always has been the largest drug kingpin, you know, out there\r\n(Say fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask)\r\nI think he's responsible for, for hundreds of quantities of drugs moving it into the United States\r\n(Flat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked)\r\nI wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious\n\nSometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious\n\nI got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo\n\nI come through poppin' it off, call the coroner\n\nYou see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras\n\nI'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball\n\nPink shirt on me just to match my diamonds\n\nNASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'\n\nBig dawg but I feel just like a giant\n\nWithdrawals, pass my cup, I think I'm dyin'\n\n\n\nSay fuck the drug test, go'n pass my gas mask\n\nFlat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked\n\nSuper like Goldie Mack, ho caught an asthma attack\n\nHoes gettin' their toes tagged, kill 'em dead at Hermes\n\nTurn up on purpose, I have her nervous\n\nI don't have no stylist, make my own purchase\n\nLow top my Gucci, I was wrapped in turban\n\nKnew she was a hoochie, I had to murk it\n\nNow I got power, I feel like Curtis\n\nI gave her Pucci, I felt like she was worth it\n\n\n\nI wanna live like a drug lord, but I wanna be glorious\n\nSometimes I feel like a kingpin, I'm so victorious\n\nI got a white and a black girl, they look like an Oreo\n\nI come through poppin' it off, call the coroner\n\nYou see these chains on my neck, look like Mardi Gras\n\nI'm throwin' the cash in the air like a volleyball\n\nPink shirt on me just to match my diamonds\n\nNASCAR Lamborghini when I'm drivin'\n\n\n\nSay fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask\n\nFlat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked\n\nSay fuck the drug test, gon' pass my gas mask\n\nFlat screen, I back back, I see my racks stacked\n\nThe WIZRD",
