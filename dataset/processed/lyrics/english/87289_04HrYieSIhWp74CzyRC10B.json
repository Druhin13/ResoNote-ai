  "lyrics": "A sucker for your loving - a sucker for your kissing\r\nIt´s like a heatwave in July - everytime we´re eye to eye\r\nA sucker for your rubbing - a sucker for your twisting\r\nYou take me to the danger zone - but leave me shaking to the bone\r\nSweet like honey - banging like a bomb\n\nTurning me on, you´re turning me on, you´re turning me on...\n\n\n\nCan I have it? Can I touch it?\n\nNow you really gotta let it know\n\nCause I feel like I´m about to blow\n\nWhen you act like that - I can´t fight the feeling\n\nGrab it? Can I love it?\n\nNow you really gotta let me show\n\nCause I don´t know how to take it slow\n\nWhen you act like that - I can´t fight the feeling\n\n\n\nA sucker for your touching - a sucker for your teasing\n\nBut I´m not out to sneak a feel - I wanna get to freak for real\n\nA sucker for your hugging - a sucker for your squeezing\n\nI bet you feel it all inside - so let me know I´m qualified\n\n\n\nSweet like honey - banging like a bomb\n\nTurning me on, you´re turning me on, you´re turning me on...\n\n\n\nCan I have it? Can I touch it?\n\nNow you really gotta let it show\n\nCause I feel like I´m about to blow\n\nWhen you act like that - I can´t fight the feeling\n\nGrab it? Can I love it?\n\nNow you really gotta let me know\n\nCause I don´t know how to take it slow\n\nWhen you act like that - I can´t fight the feeling\n\n\n\nBaby I´m excited - gotta have it\n\nI can´t deny it - gotta have it\n\nI don´t know how to fight it - gotta have it\n\nTurning me on, you´re turning me on\n\nLove the way U flaunt it - gotta have it\n\nGirl I really want it - gotta have it\n\nCause you´re turning me on, you´re turning me on, you´re turning me on",
