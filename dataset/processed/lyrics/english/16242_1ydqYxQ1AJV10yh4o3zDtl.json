  "lyrics": "I still hear the drum we used to beat\r\nIt's still like a wind amongst the trees\r\nOn the edge of town\r\nWhen the sun went down\r\nLight and silhouette makes such a scene\n\nWhere's everybody gone?\n\nThis used to be the place\n\nDrifted far, the path now I can change\n\nIf you could only see\n\nHow it used to be\n\nFeel it rushing over diamond breeze\n\n\n\nTry to do it but always the same\n\nYou're walking under just a little bit further\n\nThink about it, but no one to blame\n\nTalking of it 'til my skin gets harder\n\n\n\nTry to do it but always the same\n\nYou're walking under just a little bit further\n\nThink about it, but no one to blame\n\nTalking of it 'til my skin gets harder\n\n\n\nCar lights fall across the darkened plan\n\nShine them down so we know where we stand\n\nAlways said we went too fast\n\nBut lost it on the bend\n\nHide up in the trees, you'll find our names\n\n\n\nNow we walk further feels\n\nIt never felt so real\n\nBut we were in the distance of a place\n\n\n\nTry to do it but always the same\n\nYou're walking under just a little bit further\n\nThink about it, but no one to blame\n\nTalking of it 'til my skin gets harder\n\n\n\nTry to do it but always the same\n\nYou're walking under just a little bit further\n\nThink about it, but no one to blame\n\nTalking of it 'til my skin gets harder",
