  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Alone In a Room par Asking Alexandria\r\nI've been away, a little while\nSometimes I just can't help myself\nWhen my mind's running wild\nI seem to lose grip on reality\nAnd I try to disregard the crazy things\nThe voices tell me to do but it's no use\nI tried to own it, write songs about it\nBelieve me, I tried, in the end I needed to breathe\nFind inspiration, some kind of purpose\nTo take a second to face the shit that makes me me\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\nTo sit alone in a room and say it all out loud\nEvery moment, every second, every trespass\n\nEvery awful thing, every broken dream\nA couple years back and forth with myself in a cage\nBanging my head against the wall, tryna put words on a page\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\nTo sit alone in a room, alone in a room\n\nI saw the world a couple times\nTried to cure the ache with absence\nBut that hole was still a hole\nAnd my mind kept playing tricks on me\nFeeling older every day\nTook everything I had to not crash and burn\nBut I'm starting to learn\nSometimes I'll fall down, sometimes I'll lose hope\nBut those days will be few if I keep my feet on the ground\n\nI might be lonely but I ain't alone here\nSo I keep pushing the limits of what makes me me\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\nTo sit alone in a room and say it all out loud\nEvery moment, every second, every trespass\nEvery awful thing, every broken dream\nA couple years back and forth with myself in a cage\nBanging my head against the wall, tryna put words on a page\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\nTo sit alone in a room, alone in a room\n\nI can be better than I was\nI can be better than I am\n\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\n\nTo sit alone in a room and say it all out loud\nEvery moment, every second, every trespass\nEvery awful thing, every broken dream\nA couple years back and forth with myself in a cage\nBanging my head against the wall, tryna put words on a page\nAll I needed was the last thing I wanted\nTo sit alone in a room, alone in a room",
