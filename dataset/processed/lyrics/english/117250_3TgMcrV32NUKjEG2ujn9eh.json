  "lyrics": "Danny ran into some complications\r\nHe falls asleep during conversations\r\nHe's gotta search the street when he's on vacation\r\nThe worst thing is that I'm in the same situation\r\nAnd all I do is sit and think about you\n\nIf I knew what you'd do\n\nCollapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you\n\n\n\nAnd Danny says we're living in a simulation\n\nBut he works in a petrol station (selling petrol)\n\nHe says it all began with his operation\n\nAnd I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination\n\n\n\nAnd all I do is sit and think about you\n\nIf I knew what you'd do\n\nCollapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you\n\nAll I do is sit and drink without you\n\nIf I choose then I lose\n\nDistract my brain from the terrible news\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you\n\n\n\nI can't stop sweating or control my feet\n\nI've got a twenty-stone monkey that I just can't beat\n\nI can stage a situation, but I just can't eat\n\nAnd there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace\n\n\n\nIt's true that, all I do is sit and think about you\n\nIf I knew what you'd do\n\nCollapse my veins wearing beautiful shoes\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you\n\nAll I do is sit and drink without you\n\nIf I choose then I lose\n\nDistract my brain from the terrible news\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you\n\n\n\nOh, I'll try to get a job in a bank, I think\n\nDanny spent time trying to pack in the drinks for me\n\nI feel sick and I know I can't lose but\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you, it's not, it's not\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you, it's not, it's not\n\nIt's not, it's not, It's not living if it's not with you\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you, it's not, it's not\n\nIt's not, it's not, it's not, it's not\n\nIt's not living if it's not with you",
