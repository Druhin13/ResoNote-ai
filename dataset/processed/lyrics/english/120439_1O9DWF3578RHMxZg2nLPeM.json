  "lyrics": "[On dopamine]\r\nWe have been overrun by our animal desire\r\nAddicts of the immediate keep us obedient and unaware\r\nFeeding this mutation, this Pavlovian despair\n\nWe've become disillusioned\n\nSo we run towards anything glimmering\n\n\n\nTime to put the silicon obsession down\n\nTake a look around, find a way in the silence\n\nLie supine away with your back to the ground\n\nDis- and re-connect to the resonance now\n\nYou were never an island\n\n\n\nUnique voice among the many in this choir\n\nTuning into each other, lift all higher\n\n\n\nWillingly been re-wired by clever agents within\n\nLooping our reflections, our obsessions draw us in\n\nFix and fixation, no sentience beyond\n\n\n\nWe've become disillusioned\n\nSo we dive like crows towards anything glittering\n\n\n\nTime to put the silicon obsession down\n\nTake a look around, find a way in the silence\n\nLie supine away with your back to the ground\n\nDis- and re-connect to the resonance now\n\nYou were never an island\n\n\n\nUnique voice among the many in this choir\n\nTuning into each other, lift all higher",
