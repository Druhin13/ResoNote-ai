  "lyrics": "Hey, concrete and steel\r\nDon't like the lonely way, the way I feel\r\nAnd I'm trying to find something real\r\nDying to find a place where I, where I can heal\r\nAll those ties that bind me\n\nThe past that reminds me\n\nGonna leave it all behind me\n\nDown the long road I travel\n\nWatch me unravel\n\n\n\nOoh, oh, undo my heart\n\nOh, oh, my hardest part\n\n\n\nHey, dark of the night\n\nThe sun's where I belong, I long for life\n\nI'm tired but strong from the fight\n\nAnd I'm just living, I'm living till I get it right\n\n\n\nAll those ties that bind me\n\nThe past that reminds me\n\nGonna leave it all behind me\n\nDown the long road I travel\n\nWatch me unravel\n\n\n\nOh, oh, undo my heart\n\nOh, oh, my hardest part",
