  "lyrics": "Out of the darkness\r\nI sparked a match that set the fire\r\nHear the wind talking\r\nIt's stirring up my bad desires\r\nMy love is leaving\r\nBefore the lightning hits the ground\n\nWhile I'm looking forward\n\nMy mind is moving backwards now\n\n\n\nLo-ove, my love, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\nLo-ove, my love, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\n\n\nYou're burning me up\n\nTell me you feel it now\n\nYou're burning me up\n\nI know you need it now\n\nLo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\nLo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\n\n\nI get the feeling\n\nYou worry 'bout me way too much\n\nCaught in the moment\n\nWe love what can't be good for us\n\nAnd I've been sinking\n\nInto my sheets alone at night\n\nUnder the ashes\n\nThe heat you left just won't subside\n\n\n\nYou're burning me up\n\nTell me you feel it now\n\nYou're burning me up\n\nI know you need it now\n\nLo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\nLo-o-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\n\n\nUnder the ashes, under the ashes, under the ashes\n\nI'm on fire, baby\n\nUnder the ashes, under the ashes, under the ashes\n\nI'm on fire, baby\n\nI'm on fire\n\n\n\nYou're burning me up\n\nTell me you feel it now\n\nYou're burning me up\n\nI know you need it now\n\nLo-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\nLo-o-ove, volcanic lo-o-ove\n\n\n\nLo-ove\n\n(I know you need it)\n\nLo-ove\n\n(I know you need it)\n\nLo-ove\n\n(You're burning me up)\n\nLo-ove\n\n(You're burning me up)\n\nLo-ove\n\n(You're burning me up)\n\nLo-ove\n\n(You're burning me up)\n\nLo-ove\n\nUnder the ashes, under the ashes, under the ashes\n\nI'm on fire, baby",
