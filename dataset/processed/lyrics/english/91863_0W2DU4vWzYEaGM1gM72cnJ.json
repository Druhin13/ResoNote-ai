  "lyrics": "Will you take me as I am?\r\nDraw the clove sign in your hand\r\nAcross the highway there's a girl I used to be\r\nSwim in the deep end, not afraid of anything\r\nI feel like an ocean, washing away\n\nGasping for air now under the wave\n\nYou're pulling me deeper, deeper till I'm broken\n\nI feel like an ocean, washing away\n\nDrown in the silence, nothing to say\n\nYou're pulling me deeper, deeper till I'm broken\n\n\n\nFind some creatures you and I\n\nIn my future, is it bright?\n\nDo you feel better knowing that I'm far away?\n\nMaybe it's alright living with the memories\n\n\n\nI feel like an ocean, washing away\n\nGasping for air now under the wave\n\nYou're pulling me deeper, deeper till I'm broken\n\nI feel like an ocean, washing away\n\nDrown in the silence, nothing to say\n\nYou're pulling me deeper, deeper till I'm broken\n\n\n\nIs it real hard, is it real hard\n\nYou pulling me deeper, deeper till I'm broken",
