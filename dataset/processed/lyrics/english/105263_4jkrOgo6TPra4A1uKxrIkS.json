Who can stand against?\n\n(My God) My God has strong and open hands\n\n(That cover me) That cover me in mercy\n\n(He covers me) He covers me in mercy\n\n(He covers me) Your mercy covers me\n\nWho can stand against? (who can stand against?)\n\nMy God has strong and open hands\n\n(That cover me) That cover me in mercy\n\nHe covers me in mercy\n\nYour mercy covers me",
