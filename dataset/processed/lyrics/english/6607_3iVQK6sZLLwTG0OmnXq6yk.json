  "lyrics": "You threw your books into the river\r\nTold your Mom that you're a non-believer\r\nShe says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok\r\nYou say nobody loves a city\r\nNobody loves what can't love 'em back\n\nOne-way ticket in your pocket\n\nWhat happened to the charm of a small town?\n\n\n\nIf you find what you're looking for\n\nBe sure to send a postcard\n\nYou promised you'd never forget\n\nThe little ones when you got big\n\n\n\nYou deal an unspoken debt\n\nNo kindness without wanting something back\n\nWhat do I owe you? What did I forget?\n\nAre we even after all of that?\n\n\n\nYou shook my hand and said goodbye\n\nYou'll never let me see you cry again\n\nWhat good has come from learning to pretend?\n\nYou said I could've been a better friend\n\n\n\nIf you find what you're looking for\n\nBe sure to send a new address\n\nAnd if you find what you're looking for\n\nWrite a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is\n\n\n\nEverybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out\n\nEverybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out\n\nEverybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out\n\nEverybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out",
