  "lyrics": "I am not afraid of staring down your loaded gun\r\nIf we're being honest I am done with\r\nYour drugged-up love\r\nWe are not the same\r\nAnd I'm feeling like I'm already dead\r\nI'm like, \"god bless you all\"\n\nThis is it, I am going to hell\n\nBut you're coming as well\n\n\n\nNo way out\n\nYou can talk the talk but it doesn't matter\n\nNo way out\n\n'Cause I'm walking right into a disaster\n\nYou know it used to be fun but not anymore\n\nSo right now\n\nIt's more than I can afford\n\nNo way out\n\n\n\nI will not complain I just talk to you 'cause I'm bored\n\nYou are one of many in and out this revolving door\n\nAnd I'm not naming names\n\nI don't want to play this game anymore\n\nIt's more than I can afford\n\n\n\nNo way out\n\nIt doesn't matter\n\nNo way out\n\nBut we're in this together\n\nYou know it used to be fun but not anymore\n\nSo right now\n\nIt's more than I can afford\n\nNo way out",
