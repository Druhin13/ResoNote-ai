  "lyrics": "Last night I drove to Harper's Ferry and I thought about you\r\nThere were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs\r\nThe speed limit kept decreasing by ten\r\nAs we entered a town about halfway there\r\nIt was almost raining at the train station\r\nWe put our hoods on our heads at the train station\n\nWe threw rocks into the river\n\nThe river underneath the train tracks\n\n\n\nAnd when the train came it was so big and powerful\n\nWhen it came into the little station\n\nI wanted to put my arms around it\n\nBut the conductor looked at me funny\n\nSo we had to say goodbye and leave\n\nThe monopoly board still in the backseat\n\nTook that nightmare left turn to get out of town\n\nRan into the decreasing speed limits again\n\n\n\nWhat should I do? (Eat breakfast)\n\nWhat should I do? (Eat lunch)\n\nWhat should I do? (Eat dinner)\n\nWhat should I do? (Go to bed)\n\nWhere can I go? (Go to the store)\n\nWhere can I go? (Apply for jobs)\n\nWhere can I go? (Go to a friend's)\n\nWhere can I go? (Go to bed)\n\n\n\nI wrote \"Beach Death\" when I thought you were taken\n\nI wrote \"Beach Funeral\" when I knew you were taken\n\nI wrote \"Beach Fagz\"—well it wasn't about you\n\nBut it could've been, well no it couldn't have\n\nI spent a week in Ocean City\n\nAnd came back to find you were gone\n\nI spent a week in Illinois\n\nAnd came back to find you were still gone\n\n\n\nI pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends\n\nI never came out to my friends\n\nWe were all on Skype\n\nAnd I laughed and I changed the subject\n\nShe said, \"what's with this dog motif?\"\n\nI said \"do you have something against dogs\"\n\n\n\nI am almost completely soulless\n\nI am incapable of being human\n\nI am incapable of being inhuman\n\nI am living uncontrollably\n\n\n\nIt should be called anti-depression\n\nAs a friend of mine suggested\n\nBecause it's not the sadness that hurts you\n\nIt's the brain's reaction against it\n\n\n\nIt's not enough to love the unreal\n\nI am inseparable from the impossible\n\nI want gravity to stop for me\n\nMy soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature\n\nI want a cut scene\n\nI want a cut from your face to my face\n\nI want a cut I want\n\nThe next related video\n\n\n\nI don't want to go insane\n\nI don't want to have schizophrenia\n\n\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\n\n\n\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\n\n\n\nLast night I dreamed he was trying to kill you\n\nI woke up and I was trying to kill you\n\nIt's been a year since we first met\n\nI don't know if we're boyfriends yet\n\n\n\nDo you have any crimes that\n\nWe can use to pass the time I am\n\nRunning out of drugs to try\n\n\n\nWe said we hated humans\n\nWe wanted to be humans\n\nWe said we hated humans\n\nWe wanted to be humans\n\n\n\nGet more groceries, get eaten\n\nGet more groceries, get eaten\n\nGet more groceries, get eaten\n\n\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh\n\nOh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh\n\n\n\nIn the mall in the nighttime\n\nYou came back alone with a flashlight\n\nIt was the start of nothing (backwards)\n\nAnd it was my favorite scene\n\nI couldn’t tell you what it means\n\nBut it meant something to me\n\n\n\nAnd pretty soon you'll find some nice young\n\nSatanist with braces and one\n\nCapital \"o\", significant Other\n\nAnd you can take him home to your mother and\n\nSay \"ma, this is my brother\"\n\n\n\nWe said we hated humans\n\nWe wanted to be humans\n\nWe said we hated humans\n\nWe wanted to be humans\n\n\n\nGet more groceries, get eaten\n\nGet more groceries, get eaten\n\nGet more groceries, get eaten\n\nBy the one you love\n\nWhen they put their lips around you\n\nYou can feel their smile from the inside\n\n\n\n\n\nLast night I dreamed he was trying to kill you\n\nI woke up and I was trying to kill you\n\n\n\nYour ears perked up\n\nI perked up when your ears perked up\n\nYou were all looking around\n\nAnd I hoped it was for me\n\nI hoped you were using your sonar systems for me\n\n\n\nThe ancients saw it coming\n\nYou can see that they tried to warn them\n\nIn the tales that they told their children\n\nBut they fell out of their heads in the morning\n\nThey said sex can be frightening\n\nBut the children were not listening\n\nAnd the children cut out everything\n\nExcept for the kissing and the singing\n\n\n\nWhen they finally found their home\n\nAt Walt Disney studios\n\nAnd then everyone grew up\n\nWith their fundamental schemes fucked\n\nBut there are lots of fish left in the sea\n\nThere are lots of fish in business suits\n\nThat talk and walk on human feet\n\nAnd visit doctors, have weak knees\n\n\n\nOh please let me join your cult\n\nI'll paint my face in your colors\n\nYou have a real nice face\n\nI had an early death\n\n\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\nThe ocean washed open your grave\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\nThe ocean washed open your grave\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\nThe ocean washed open your grave\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\n(We're too scared to do shit)\n\nThe ocean washed open your grave",
