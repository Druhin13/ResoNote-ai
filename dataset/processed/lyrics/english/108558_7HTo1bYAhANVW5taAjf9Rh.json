  "lyrics": "If you always feel like you're doin' something wrong\r\nMust be doin' somethin' right\r\nJust means you're tryin' to please me\r\nWhen the only thing I'm needin' is a good old fashioned fight\r\nWe get each other high\n\nWe make each other try\n\nWe make each other want to cry\n\nWe make each other laugh\n\nWe set each other free\n\nHoney can't you see this too shall pass\n\n\n\nWhen you feel like you're not gettin' the attention you deserve\n\nYou're probably stealin' the show\n\nSometimes it's hard to look at the day\n\nThat don't change the fact that we'll never let each other go\n\n\n\nWe get each other high\n\nWe make each other try\n\nWe make each other want to cry\n\nWe make each other laugh\n\nWe set each other free\n\nHoney can't you see this too shall pass\n\n\n\nI love you at your worst, you hate it when I hurt\n\nHoney can't you see you're everything to me\n\nAnd I'm everything to you, we'll do what we got to do\n\nTo make it last\n\nThis too shall pass\n\n\n\nWe get each other high\n\nWe make each other try\n\nWe make each other want to cry\n\nWe make each other laugh\n\nWe set each other free\n\nHoney can't you see this too shall pass\n\nThis too shall pass",
