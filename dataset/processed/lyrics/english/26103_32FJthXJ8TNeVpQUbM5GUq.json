  "lyrics": "From the empty streets to abandoned homes\r\nThere's a stinging feeling in my eye\r\nShelter underground in case the big one comes\r\nWhy would you plan for it not to work out right?\r\nMy focus was blurred\n\nAs the world became consumed\n\nFor who?\n\n\n\nFrom the lookout tower another fired flare\n\nI wonder if there's a light inside that heart\n\nTo escape the mess from every misstep\n\nWhy build another bridge that lead nowhere\n\n\n\nMy focus was blurred\n\nAs the world became consumed\n\nFor who?\n\n\n\nWhat's embedded, we're coming up for air\n\nBecome outdated, we're coming up for air\n\nLost in the details, we're coming up for air\n\nIt's raining ashes, we're coming up for air\n\nWe're coming up for air\n\n\n\nWe're coming up\n\nEven though they say it won't change a thing\n\nThese broken promises\n\nOnly can last so long\n\n'Fore it all goes away",
