  "lyrics": "Two days in Savannah\r\nWith your name in my gut\r\nOn a bed full of crossed out lines and cigarette butts\r\nLike a bird scans the ocean\r\nAre you searching for love?\r\nIs it under your feet or in the heavens above?\r\nIf I could give you\r\nAll that you needed\r\nCut myself open and forced you to feel it\r\nIf I spit fire\r\nIf I hang high upon a wire\r\nIf I pull my heart out\r\nWould you tell me that it's good enough?\r\n♪\r\nTwo nights in Savannah\r\nAnd there's nothing so blue\r\nLike the sweat on my back and the lack of the truth\r\nSo I walk till I'm tired\r\nAnd retire when I'm fit\r\nBut there's no escaping all the words that you said\r\nIf I could give you all that you needed\r\nCut myself open and forced you to feel it\r\nIf I spit fire\r\nIf I hang high upon a wire\r\nIf I pull my heart out\r\nWould you tell me that it's good enough?\r\n♪\r\nTell me that it's good enough?\r\n♪\r\nTell me that it's good enough?\r\n♪\r\nTell me that it's good enough?\r\n♪\r\nIf I could give you all that you needed\r\nCut myself open and forced you to feel it\r\nIf I spit fire\r\nIf I hang high upon a wire\r\nIf I pull my heart out\r\nWould you tell me that it's good enough?\r\nIf I pull my heart out\r\nTell me that I'm good enough?",
