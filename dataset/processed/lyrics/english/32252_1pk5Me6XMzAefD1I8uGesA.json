  "lyrics": "Come along, catch a Heffalump,\r\nSit with me on a muddy clump,\r\nWe'll sing a song of days gone by.\r\nRun along now, don’t be glum,\r\nGet you gone, now, have some fun,\n\nDon't be long, for the end is nigh.\n\n\n\nDon't let moments pass along\n\nAnd waste before your eyes;\n\n\n\nMarch with me and the borogoves,\n\nCome with me and the slithy toves,\n\nAnd never ask us why.\n\n\n\nCome, come, come, come, come along now,\n\nRun away from the hum-drum,\n\nWe'll go to a place that is safe from\n\nGreed, anger and boredom.\n\n\n\nWe'll dance and sing till sundown,\n\nAnd feast with abandon,\n\nWe'll sleep when the morning comes,\n\nAnd we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.\n\n\n\nWe'll be here when the world slows down,\n\nAnd the sunbeams fade away,\n\nKeeping time by a pendulum\n\nAs the fabric starts to fray.\n\n\n\nThere’s no such thing as time to kill,\n\nNor time to throw away,\n\nSo, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty,\n\nThrice for another day.\n\n\n\nCome, come, come, come, come along now,\n\nRun away from the hum-drum,\n\nWe'll go to a place that is safe from\n\nGreed, anger and boredom.\n\n\n\nWe'll dance and sing till sundown,\n\nAnd feast with abandon,\n\nWe'll sleep when the morning comes,\n\nAnd we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.\n\n\n\nCome with me, catch a rare type specimen,\n\nCuddle up with a hesitant skeleton,\n\nWe'll break our fast with friends.\n\n\n\nOnce we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly,\n\nMany moons to the west of here and happily,\n\nOur journey never ends.\n\n\n\nShut your ears when sirens sing,\n\nTie armbands to your feet;\n\n\n\nListen up and you won't go wrong again,\n\nFloat along on a verse-less song and then,\n\nGet to where the two ends meet.\n\n\n\nCome, come, come, come, come along now,\n\nRun away from the hum-drum,\n\nWe'll go to a place that is safe from\n\nGreed, anger and boredom.\n\n\n\nWe'll dance and sing till sundown,\n\nAnd feast with abandon,\n\nWe'll sleep when the morning comes,\n\nAnd we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.",
