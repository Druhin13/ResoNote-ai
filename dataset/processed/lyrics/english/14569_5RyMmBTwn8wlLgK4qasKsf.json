  "lyrics": "Criminal soulless\r\nCriminal silence\r\nTearing the seams like criminal violence\r\nAnd the silence that we train to the sorrow that remains\r\nSongbirds describing refrains\r\nI can't see\n\nI can't speak\n\nI can't walk\n\nI can't talk\n\nI can see how it's falling apart\n\nThere was a time when we were held above\n\nInto the falling when we're dying for love\n\n\n\nOh\n\nIt's the last of goodbyes\n\nOh\n\nIt's the last of goodbyes\n\n\n\nGrace me\n\nPraise me\n\nFall to pieces as this wanting wastes me\n\nIt crazes me\n\nIt praises me\n\nLift me down, let it save me\n\nWith no sight\n\nI can't accept what I see\n\nWith no grace\n\nI can't accept what I'll be\n\nBack to a time when we were held from above\n\nInto to the falling when we're dying for love\n\n\n\nOh\n\nIt's the last of goodbyes\n\nOh\n\nIt's the last of goodbyes",
