  "lyrics": "Don't wanna get ahead of myself\r\nFeeling things I've never felt\r\nIt's kinda hard for me to explain\r\nHer personality and everything\r\nBrings me to my knees, ooh\r\nShe shines me up like gold on my arm\n\nI wanna take it slow but it's so hard\n\nI love to see her face in daylight\n\nIt's more than just our bodies at night\n\nBut she's really tempting me, ooh\n\nDo you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?\n\n\n\nI'm scared to death that she might be it\n\nThat the love is real, that the shoe might fit\n\nShe might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)\n\nSpace and time in the afterlife\n\nWill she have my kids? Will she be my wife?\n\nShe might just be my everything and beyond\n\n\n\nI wanna bring her 'round to meet ya\n\nI think you'd like her kind demeanor\n\nI know that Grandma would've loved her, like she was her own\n\nShe makes me feel home, ooh\n\nDo you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?\n\n\n\nI'm scared to death that she might be it\n\nThat the love is real, that the shoe might fit\n\nShe might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)\n\nSpace and time in the afterlife\n\nWill she have my kids? Will she be my wife?\n\nShe might just be my everything and beyond\n\n\n\nI give up, I'm in love crying out to you\n\nO me o my I can't explain\n\nShe might just be my everything\n\nO me o my I can't explain\n\nShe might just be my everything\n\nO me o my I can't explain\n\nShe might just be my everything\n\nDo you think I'm being foolish if I don't rush in?\n\n\n\nI'm scared to death that she might be it\n\nThat the love is real, that the shoe might fit\n\nShe might just be my everything and beyond (beyond)\n\nSpace and time in the afterlife\n\nWill she have my kids? Will she be my wife?\n\nShe might just be my everything and beyond\n\n\n\n(She might just be mine)\n\nO me o my I can't explain\n\n(She might just be mine)\n\nShe might just be my everything\n\n(She might just be mine)\n\nO me o my I can't explain\n\n(She might just be mine)\n\nShe might just be my everything\n\n(She might just be mine)\n\nO me o my I can't explain\n\n(She might just be mine)\n\nShe might just be my everything\n\nShe might just be mine, be mine",
