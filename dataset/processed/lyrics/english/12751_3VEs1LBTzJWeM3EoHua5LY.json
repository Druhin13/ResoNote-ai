  "lyrics": "Falling too fast to prepare for this\r\nTripping in the world could be dangerous\r\nEverybody circling is vulturous\r\nNegative, nepotist\r\nEverybody waiting for the fall of man\r\nEverybody praying for the end of times\n\nEverybody hoping they could be the one\n\nI was born to run, I was born for this\n\nWhip, whip\n\nRun me like a race horse\n\nPull me like a rip cord\n\nBreak me down and build me up\n\nI wanna be the slip, slip\n\nWord upon your lip, lip\n\nLetter that you rip, rip\n\nBreak me down and build me up\n\n\n\nWhatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins\n\nI do whatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains\n\nWhatever it takes\n\nYou take me to the top\n\nI'm ready for whatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins\n\nI do what it takes\n\n\n\nAlways had a fear of being typical\n\nLooking at my body feeling miserable\n\nAlways hanging on to the visual\n\nI wanna be invisible\n\nLooking at my years like a martyrdom\n\nEverybody needs to be a part of them\n\nNever be enough from the particle sum\n\nI was born to run, I was born for this\n\nWhip, whip\n\nRun me like a race horse\n\nPull me like a rip cord\n\nBreak me down and build me up\n\nI wanna be the slip, slip\n\nWord upon your lip, lip\n\nLetter that you rip, rip\n\nBreak me down and build me up\n\n\n\nWhatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins\n\nI do whatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains\n\nWhatever it takes\n\nYou take me to the top\n\nI'm ready for whatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins\n\nI do what it takes\n\n\n\nHypocritical, egotistical\n\nDon't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical\n\nWorking onto something that I'm proud of\n\nOut of the box an epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost\n\nI'm an apostrophe\n\nI'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see\n\nI'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe\n\nAnd yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased\n\nAnd when I am deceased\n\nAt least I go down to the grave and die happily\n\nLeave the body of my soul to be a part of me\n\nI do what it takes\n\n\n\nWhatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins\n\nI do whatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains\n\nWhatever it takes\n\nYou take me to the top\n\nI'm ready for whatever it takes\n\n'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins\n\nI do what it takes",
