  "lyrics": "I was in an empty space\r\nAvoiding your love never gave me grace\r\nSpendin' all my time away\r\nBetter to want you in retrograde\r\nAnd how do you love?\n\nHow do you love?\n\nHow do you love?\n\nHow do you love?\n\n\n\nWhat makes you make me feel like a woman?\n\nI'm sayin' things that I thought that I wouldn't\n\nAnd now you caught me, remind me of my beatin' heart\n\nI'll be your Venus if you were my Mars, yeah\n\nWhat makes you make me feel like a woman?\n\n\n\nSpeak to me incredibly\n\nUnfolding my arms until I'm in the deep\n\nYou bury me shamelessly\n\nAnd leave me to want inescapably\n\n\n\nAnd how do you love?\n\nHow do you love?\n\nHow do you love?\n\nHow do you love?\n\n\n\nWhat makes you make me feel like a woman?\n\nI'm sayin' things that I thought that I wouldn't\n\nAnd now you caught me, remind me of my beatin' heart\n\nI'll be your Venus if you were my Mars, yeah\n\nWhat makes you make me feel like a woman? Oh\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes you make me feel like a woman?\n\nI'm sayin' things that I thought that I wouldn't\n\nAnd now you caught me, remind me of my beatin' heart\n\nI'll be your Venus if you were my Mars, yeah\n\nWhat makes you make me feel like a woman? Oh",
