  "lyrics": "Something about the way that you walked into my living room\r\nCasually and confident lookin' at the mess I am\r\nBut still you, still you want me\r\nStress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits\r\nLate bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'\r\nBut still you, still you want me\n\n\n\nOh, I always let you down\n\nYou're shattered on the ground\n\nBut still I find you there\n\nNext to me\n\nAnd oh, stupid things I do\n\nI'm far from good, it's true\n\nBut still I find you\n\nNext to me (next to me)\n\n\n\nThere's something about the way that you always see the pretty view\n\nOverlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless\n\nAnd still you, still you want me\n\nI got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege\n\nI am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts\n\nAnd still you, still you want me\n\n\n\nOh, I always let you down\n\nYou're shattered on the ground\n\nBut still I find you there\n\nNext to me\n\nAnd oh, stupid things I do\n\nI'm far from good, it's true\n\nBut still I find you\n\nNext to me (next to me)\n\n\n\nSo thank you for taking a chance on me\n\nI know it isn't easy\n\nBut I hope to be worth it (oh)\n\nSo thank you for taking a chance on me\n\nI know it isn't easy\n\nBut I hope to be worth it (oh)\n\n\n\nOh, I always let you down (I always let you down)\n\nYou're shattered on the ground, (shattered on the ground)\n\nBut still I find you there\n\nNext to me\n\nAnd oh, stupid things I do (stupid things we do)\n\nI'm far from good, it's true\n\nBut still I find you\n\nNext to me (next to me)",
