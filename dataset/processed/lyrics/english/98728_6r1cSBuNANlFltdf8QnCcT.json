  "lyrics": "It’s the longest night of the darkest year\r\nThe one you learn that life can go and disappear\r\nAnd the holy light is it gathering here\r\nCause how can he explain the kind of pain you feel\r\nSaid I just want to hold you\n\nI don’t really know if I can fix this dear\n\nHate to see you hurting\n\nNo you’re not a burden\n\nI volunteer\n\n\n\nWon’t drown in the river\n\nI’ll swim out to you\n\nI’ll stand and deliver\n\nI’ll carry through\n\nIf you lose all the meaning of\n\nLife, love and truth\n\nI’ll stand and deliver\n\nI’ll show up for you\n\n\n\nIt comes to pass, don’t come to stay\n\nBut heal these wounds\n\nWhen you had a very bad day\n\nAs long as we are living\n\nThe dessert is our lie\n\nWe’ll hold on to each other in the darkest and the light\n\n\n\nWon’t drown in the river\n\nI’ll swim out to you\n\nI’ll stand and deliver\n\nI’ll carry through\n\nIf you lose all the meaning of\n\nLife, love and truth\n\nI’ll stand and deliver\n\nI’ll show up for you\n\nI’ll stand, stand and deliver (x4)\n\n\n\nEven though you’ve been low, oh darling\n\nYou got someone to keep your head up high\n\n\n\nWon’t drown in the river I’ll swim out to you\n\nI’ll stand and deliver\n\nI’ll carry through\n\nIf you lose all the meaning of\n\nLife, love and truth\n\nI’ll stand and deliver\n\nI’ll show up for you\n\nI’ll stand, stand and deliver (x2)\n\n\n\nI stand\n\nI stand\n\nStand and deliver",
