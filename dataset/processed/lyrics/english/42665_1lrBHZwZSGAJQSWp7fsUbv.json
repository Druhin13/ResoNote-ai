  "lyrics": "Someone told me long ago\r\nThere's a calm before the storm\r\nI know it's been coming for some time\r\nWhen it's over so they say\r\nIt'll rain on a sunny day\n\nI know shinning down like water\n\n\n\nI want to know\n\nHave you ever seen the rain\n\nI want to know\n\nHave you ever seen the rain\n\nComing down on a sunny day\n\n\n\nYesterday and days before\n\nSun is cold and rain is hard\n\nI know, been that way for all my time\n\n\n\n'Til forever, on it goes\n\nThrough the circle of fast and slow\n\nI know it can't stop, I wonder\n\n\n\nI want to know\n\nHave you ever seen the rain\n\nI want to know\n\nHave you ever seen the rain\n\nComing down on a sunny day\n\n\n\nI want to know\n\nHave you ever seen the rain\n\nI want to know\n\nHave you ever seen the rain\n\nComing down on a sunny day",
