  "lyrics": "First time I came to the city\r\nI knew just what I'd do\r\nI got me some wheels and a grip I could feel\r\nSome wine and some tape for my reel to reel\r\nThis time around I thought I make a good thing last\n\nI thought I'd do a whole lot better\n\nI tried to make sense and I was getting quite good at it\n\nSomehow I got washed up and I lost it entirely\n\n\n\nSo take one more look at me honey\n\nWhy am I not sitting on top of your hill\n\nI'm not in the mood not fit for the climb\n\nI do what I can but I'm falling behind you\n\n\n\nLook at what I'm willing to give you\n\nYou can have both of my eyes\n\nThrow me in a hole and let me fade away slow\n\nBut please don't abandon my soul\n\n\n\nThe second time I came to the city\n\nThings got really weird\n\nSome things never change\n\nI lost it once again\n\nI took a chance it got me here\n\nBut what it is itâ€˜s not too clear\n\n\n\nSo take one more look at me honey\n\nWhy am I not sitting on top of your hill\n\nI'm not in the mood not fit for the climb\n\nI do what I can but I'm falling behind you\n\n\n\nLook at what I'm willing to give you\n\nYou can have both of my eyes\n\nThrow me in a hole and let me fade away slow\n\nBut please don't abandon my soul\n\n\n\nLook at what I'm willing to do for you\n\nYou can have both of my eyes\n\nThrow them in a hole\n\nAnd let them rot away slow\n\nBut please don't abandon my soul\n\nPlease don't abandon my soul",
