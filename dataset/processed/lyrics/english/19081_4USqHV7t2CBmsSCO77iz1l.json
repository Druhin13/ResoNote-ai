  "lyrics": "It's like I dream, but I'm wide awake and,\r\nfinding comfort in these walls,\r\nin this town of a million faces,\r\nbut I've always wanted something more.\r\n\nOn a road with no destination,\n\nfollowing my beating heart,\n\nsometimes it takes a leap of faith\n\nto find out who you really are.\n\n\n\nWhen they said that I was crazy,\n\nI always knew that you were there for me.\n\nA million faces all around, but\n\nit's yours I miss the most.\n\n\n\nI always knew,\n\nI'd be walking through the streets of gold,\n\nbut here's the truth-\n\nnothing really feels like home.\n\n\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nNothing really feels like home\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nNothing really feels like home\n\n\n\nFor a year I'm in taxi's waiting,\n\nseeing life as a different pace.\n\nSometimes you just got up and leave,\n\ndon't let anyone get you down.\n\n\n\nCause I know they said that I was crazy,\n\nbut I always knew that you were there for me.\n\nA million faces all around, but\n\nit's yours I miss the most.\n\n\n\nI always knew,\n\nI'd be looking through the streets of gold,\n\nbut here's the truth-\n\nnothing really feels like home.\n\n\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nNothing really feels like home\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nNothing really feels like home\n\n\n\nHome, home, home,\n\nhome\n\n\n\nI always knew,\n\nI'd be walking through the streets of gold,\n\nbut here's the truth-\n\nnothing really feels like home\n\n\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nNothing really feels like home\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nNothing really feels like home\n\n\n\nOhhh...\n\n\n\nJust take me back to you, you\n\nCause nothing really feels like home",
