  "lyrics": "You buried me in a shallow grave\nOne without no name\nYou poisoned my rivers\n\n\nJust to try and keep me tamed\n\n\n\nYou were my shadow of darkness\n\n\n\nKeeping out all the light\n\n\n\nYou cut off my lifelines, baby, to try and see if I'd fight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling this heartache of mine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI walk around all over town hoping that I'd find the one\n\n\n\nBut as fate would have it, I know you are the one\n\n\n\nSo I shed off this shadow to you, hoping that you'd see it, too\n\n\n\nAnd I'll wait and I'll wait for the darkness to come on through\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling this heartache of mine",
