  "lyrics": "She sings sweet things\r\nTo the ones that take her home\r\nAfter the laughter\r\nShe's left stuck on her own\r\nI know dust grows\n\nEven when there is a breeze\n\nCan't move, can't grow\n\nWhen you're falling on your knees\n\n\n\nShe talks at night\n\nWhen nobody is there\n\nAsking for signs\n\nTo show they really care\n\n\n\nLove, please, surround me\n\nI know I've got more to give\n\nThere are reasons to leave\n\nBut a thousand more to live\n\n\n\nWill it be this way tomorrow\n\nAfter all that's been today?\n\nWill it be this way tomorrow?\n\nI don't know, but I won't fade\n\n\n\nLove, please, surround me\n\nI know I've got more to give\n\nThere are reasons to leave\n\nBut a thousand more to live",
