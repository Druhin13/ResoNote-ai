  "lyrics": "City lights\r\nBeen treatin' me right\r\nOn this side of the wall\r\nI'm thinkin' it's time\r\nTo turn on a dime\r\nFor the Sierra Madre call\n\nI caught wind\n\nFrom a friend of a friend\n\nOf mighty wealth untold\n\nIf the stories are true\n\nNothin' left to do\n\nBut head down to Mexico\n\n\n\nDesert wind\n\nBlowin' me away again\n\nNow you're my only friend\n\nI've got left to call\n\n\n\nBought a two-bit mule\n\nFrom a horse-theivin' fool\n\nTo cross the Rio Grande alone\n\nI had to steer clear\n\nBut I had not a fear\n\nWhere the federale roamed\n\nOnce I was through\n\nI knew what to do\n\nHad to send that old mule home\n\nI'm now on the trail\n\nThat lead most to hell\n\nAfter Pancho Villa's gold\n\n\n\nDesert wind\n\nBlowin' me away again\n\nNow you're my only friend\n\nI've got left to call\n\n\n\nDesert wind\n\nBlowin' me away again\n\nNow you're my only friend\n\nI've got left to call\n\n\n\nFollowed the words\n\nThat I'd been told\n\nAmongst the hillside shadows cold\n\nWhen I talked to him\n\nI caught a chill\n\nFor the cavern it did hold\n\nThe answers to questions that I never had\n\nWith riches I could hold\n\nBut truth of a man ain't built with hands or Pancho Villaâ€™s gold\n\n\n\nIt's that desert wind\n\nBlowin' me home again\n\nNow you're the only friend\n\nThat I'll ever call\n\n\n\nIt's that desert wind\n\nBlowin' me home again\n\nNow you're the only friend\n\nI'll ever call",
