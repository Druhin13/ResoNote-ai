  "lyrics": "Well the girl in the forest\r\nReached out to ease my worried mind\r\nStopped me from falling into a downward spiral\r\nI was worn by the city until I finally let go\r\nDrifted out to the Sierras on an empty road\n\nA careless love\n\nWon't get you far\n\nI found a book of John Muir's\n\nIn an abandoned car\n\n\n\nWell the world was spinning so fast\n\nNobody took the time\n\nIt was the girl in the forest\n\nWho opened my eyes\n\n\n\nWhat part of nature can you honestly say\n\nIs beyond your explanations for short term gain\n\nSomething's got to change before everything's\n\n\n\nGonna disappear right before our eyes\n\nAnd we finally face ourselves alone in the forest\n\nWhere so much rides on which path we decide",
