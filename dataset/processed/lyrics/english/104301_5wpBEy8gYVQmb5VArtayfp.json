  "lyrics": "Seldom have I ever questioned the end\r\nStill I grow frost when I’m reminded\r\nEuphemisms on a loop interchange\r\nWhich hands get to turn the final page?\r\nIn whose throat belongs the swan song\r\nOf crisis, warming, denial, change?\n\n\n\nStage TV helps the public explain\n\nBroadcast beamed into the dry terrain\n\nImages of drenched survival\n\nWithout hope but soaked with pain\n\nConsequences of reality felt\n\nAll conditions of humanity built\n\nOn the bridges\n\nTent villages waiting for the state to help\n\n\n\nGlass barely bends before it cracks\n\nEmbedded down into our path\n\nPaved in the crimson of our tracks\n\nWithout the chance of turning back\n\nBefore the water gets too high\n\n\n\nIf the clock strikes midnight\n\nThen what becomes of our demonstrations?\n\nTo which fate have these gatherings fell?\n\nWhich halls echo all the chants we yelled\n\nInto faces on the coins we tossed into the wishing well?\n\n\n\nDrinking water on which we subsist\n\nMixing into rivers that did not exist yesterday\n\nWhen all the warning signs were there but sorely missed\n\nWhat’s it worth all the money we made\n\nFloating idly in a newborn lake?\n\nFar above financial centers\n\nCities sink like market rates\n\n\n\nGlass barely bends before it cracks\n\nEmbedded down into our path\n\nPaved in the crimson of our tracks\n\nWithout the chance of turning back\n\nBefore the water gets too high\n\n\n\nBefore the water gets too high\n\nAdd up the bribes you take\n\nAnd know time can’t be bought\n\nBy the profits that you make\n\nBefore the water gets too high\n\nTo float the powers that be\n\nOr is it someone else’s job\n\nUntil the rich are refugees?\n\nBefore the water gets too high",
