  "lyrics": "It's been a few years since you've been gone\r\nThere's been a few tears, but that was years and years ago\r\nYeah, I grew up to be exactly what you wanted\r\nYeah, I've been living out the dream that you dreamt up\r\nIt's been a few years with more to come\r\nIt's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want\n\nAnd I woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and I thought\n\nWoah, old friend, it's bittersweet\n\nBut how could you do this to me?\n\nHow could you do this to me?\n\nYeah\n\n\n\n'Cause you are not who you think you are\n\nThere's no grain on these brown eyes\n\nBut they can be green if they really want\n\nAnd I can bend your words\n\nSo they say exactly what hurts the most\n\nBut silence is better than fake laughs or faking we're always up\n\nLoose grip\n\nThe world bends around you\n\nAnd living through cracked screens\n\nWe fold down to what we want\n\nOut of love\n\nWe talk through lines, we're made of smoke\n\nAnd just in time, we drift away\n\nDiffusing light, confusing times\n\nGrowing up, or cascading down?\n\nCascading down\n\nI'm hurting now\n\n\n\nBut change comes slow\n\nIf you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?\n\nIn search of lost time\n\nJust 21 so I'm young and I'm stupid\n\nOnly 16, yeah, I think you should've known\n\nI think you fucked me up\n\nI think, I think you fucked me up\n\nAnd I've got nothing to say to you\n\n\n\nIt's been a few years and I've moved on\n\nCouldn't make it disappear, oh I tried so hard to be strong\n\nBut I grew up today and faced that I'm not just lonely\n\nDon't feel much better but I guess that it's a start",
