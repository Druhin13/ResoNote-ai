(Take me back)\n\nAnd it hurts (It hurts)\n\nLooking back (Looking back)\n\nIf this is for the best\n\nTell me why it hurts so bad (So bad)\n\n\n\nDon't let go when the daylight's gone\n\n'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn\n\nI breathe, breathe, oh\n\nWhen the cold air starts filling up my lungs\n\nWhen I hate the things that I've become\n\nI breathe, breathe, breathe, oh\n\n\n\nOoh\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\n\n\nRegrets dancing around my head\n\nEverything I never said\n\nStill numb from you (From you, from you, from you)\n\nSecrets sleeping all over this bed (Over this bed)\n\nMemories of what we did (What we did)\n\nGot mixed with you, oh-woah\n\n\n\nAnd it hurts (It hurts)\n\nLooking back (Looking back)\n\nIf this is for the best\n\nTell me why it hurts so bad (Hurts so bad)\n\n\n\nDon't let go when the daylight's gone (Light's gone)\n\n'Cause it's always darkest before the dawn\n\nI breathe, breathe, breathe (Oh, I breathe)\n\nWhen the cold air starts filling up my lungs (My lungs)\n\nI hate the things that I've become\n\nI breathe, breathe, breathe (Oh, I breathe)\n\n\n\nOoh\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nBreathe (Oh, I breathe)\n\n\n\nOoh\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nDo-do-do-do-do\n\nOoh, ooh\n\nBreathe\n\n\n\nSand keeps slipping right through my hands\n\nDays all feel the same\n\nStill numb from you",
