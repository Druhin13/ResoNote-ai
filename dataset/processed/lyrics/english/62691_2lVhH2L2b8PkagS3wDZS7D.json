Here come the Aliens!\n\nThey've all been waiting there living for millenniums\n\nMaybe they'll save us from the apocalypse when it comes\n\nA revelation that will really blow our minds!\n\nHere come the Aliens. Here come the Aliens\n\nHere come the Aliens!\n\nAhh yeah\n\n\n\nAnd now there's no avoiding, our planet we're destroying\n\nA stupid human race\n\nThey're gonna all come down, take over the world, throw us out into intergalactic space\n\nIt's too late!\n\nSo say your last goodbyes as you look to the skies\n\nYou know they tried to warn us so many times\n\nSay goodbye to mankind\n\n\n\nI know they're watching me\n\nI know they're watching me\n\nI know they're hiding out there somewhere in the galaxy\n\nThey're out there in the stars\n\nMaybe they come from Mars?\n\nHere come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!\n\nThey've all been waiting there living for millenniums\n\nMaybe they'll save us from the apocalypse when it comes\n\nA revelation that will really blow our minds!\n\nHere come the Aliens. Here come the Aliens\n\nHere come the Aliens!\n\nAhh yeah\n\n\n\nHere come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!\n\nHere come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!\n\n\n\nOooh they're coming after me, they're coming after me\n\nI know they're hiding out there, somewhere in the galaxy\n\nThey're out there in the stars\n\nMaybe they come from Mars?\n\nHere come the Aliens! Here come the Aliens!\n\nThey've all been waiting there living for millenniums\n\nMaybe they'll save us from the apocalypse when it comes\n\nA revelation that will really blow our minds!\n\n\n\nHere come the Aliens\n\nHere come the Aliens\n\nHere come the Aliens!",
