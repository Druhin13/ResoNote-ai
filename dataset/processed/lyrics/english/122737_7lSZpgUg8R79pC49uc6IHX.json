(I just got one question)\n\nWhen I choke, when I choke\n\nWhen I choke, would you try and help me breathe?\n\nCan you love, can you love\n\nCan you love the version of me\n\n\n\nCan you love, can you love\n\nCan you love the version of me\n\nI don't let, I don't let\n\nI don't let anybody else see?",
