Where the rappers at?\n\nThey told me real rap is dead, I had to laugh at that\n\nHow is it dead if Wu-Tang's Forever?\n\nBetter than the worst but Murs is still better\n\nThe Leroy and Bruce, I deployed the troops\n\nThe devil is a liar but these boys the truth\n\n\n\nGangsta ass lollipops\n\nYour bitch got a sweet tooth\n\n\n\nOkay I gave her a cavity, you hate that it had to be\n\nRegal Rhymesayer, Mister Laver, your majesty\n\nLettin' my nuts hang like Tiffany had his weave\n\nWhile y'all toss salad, anything for a salary\n\nYou call it a triumph, I call it a tragedy\n\nCasually I turn competition to casualties\n\nConverse with my rollo, I call him Murcielago\n\nOne thing I'm certain if it hurtin' 'em I know\n\nI'm an introvert, a street kid, was never into Vert\n\nI'd rather pen a verse, some call it audacity\n\nWhere did he get the nerve, usin' no blackberry\n\nNigga, you gettin' curved by labels and hoes\n\nLayaway on your clothes, another day I suppose\n\nYou portrayin' a rose, I would say you a troll\n\nAnd it's takin' his toll by the way human go\n\nI can't give a F-U-C-K what he sold\n\nIt's Fash\n\n\n\nGangsta ass lollipops\n\nYour bitch got a sweet tooth\n\n\n\nI'm in the 4-door Ford escort\n\nWith 4 escorts with high test scores\n\nIndoor dro grown next door\n\nIn class with them hickey neck sores\n\nThat's too much sauce, that's too much sauce\n\nHad to turn to Pookie, \"Baby, that's too much sauce\"\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I don't fuck with the list price\n\nRappers these days ain't been in a fist fight\n\nYou never know homie, I could be a fraud\n\nThis atheist chick I'm fuckin', she treat me like a god\n\nI'm poppin' pills in the VIP all day\n\nI'm an industry plant, I'm just playin' the long game\n\nBitch never wrote a rhyme in my life\n\nAnd after the club, I'm gonna break your wife's hymen tonight\n\nShout a couple dudes for a career in rap\n\nTurn up, turn up, fleek, fleek, bruh how real was that?\n\nPookie\n\n\n\nGangsta ass lollipops\n\nYour bitch got a sweet tooth",
