  "lyrics": "We used to run red lights and never look back\r\nWe used to chase long nights, nothing wrong with that\r\n'Cause I loved you and I lost my mind\r\nAnd now, I try to leave it, oh, I try\r\nBut you still haunt me no matter where I go\r\nAnd you hated my lasagna but you came back for more\n\nYou got me running circles in your favorite store\n\nAnd I lost you and I lost my mind\n\nAnd now, I try to leave it all behind\n\nBut I still see you no matter where I go\n\n\n\nIf I could turn back time and make it all alright\n\nOnly a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night\n\nIf I could turn back time and rewrite every line\n\nIf only I could, but baby, I can't\n\n\n\nSo I'ma scream, shout, let it all out\n\nAnd scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you\n\nSo I'ma scream, shout, let it all out\n\nAnd scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you\n\n\n\nI hit you up like, \"Hey girl, can we talk right now?\n\nI know you're far away, girl, can we hang right now?\"\n\n'Cause I loved you and I lost my mind\n\nAnd now, I try to leave it all behind\n\nBut I still see you no matter where I go\n\nI know it's getting late, girl, I don't care right now\n\nI tried to call you on the phone, girl, but you don't pick up\n\nAnd I lost you and I lost my mind\n\nNow, I tryna leave it, oh, I'm trying\n\nBut you still haunt me no matter where I go\n\n\n\nIf I could turn back time and make it all alright\n\nOnly a piece of you and me will keep me warm all night\n\nIf I could turn back time and rewrite every line\n\nIf only I could, but baby, I can't\n\n\n\nSo I'ma scream, shout, let it all out\n\nAnd scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you\n\nSo I'ma scream, shout, let it all out\n\nAnd scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you\n\n\n\nMaybe it's a mistake if we let the clock break\n\nEverything in my mind, everything in mind is telling me\n\nThat it's a mistake and it ends in heartbreak\n\nEverything in my mind, everything in mind is telling me\n\n\n\nTo try to turn back time and make it all alright\n\nOnly your piece of you and me will keep me warm all night\n\nIf I could turn back time and rewrite every line\n\nIf only I could, but baby, I can't\n\n\n\nSo I'ma scream, shout, let it all out\n\nAnd scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you\n\nSo I'ma scream, shout, let it all out\n\nAnd scream and shout and let it all out for you, for you",
