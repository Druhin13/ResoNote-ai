  "lyrics": "Look at me with your sleepy eyes\r\nOllie ollie oxen free, we don't have to hide\r\nI just wanna touch your face\r\nTake me straight to outer space\r\nCome lay me with me in our treasure trove\r\nKids don't know what it's like to fall so far\n\n\n\nCracking ya' code, nothing was chose\n\nYou were a stranger\n\nShifting the mode, breaking the mold\n\nWhere did the rain go?\n\n\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\nSo you can see me when I'm melting\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\nThey dilate when you hold me close\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\n\n\nSometimes I trip and think about the past\n\nI end up falling down a dirty path\n\nBut you bring me back, put me on track\n\nI'm being crazy\n\nYou took me in, brought me to life\n\nNow I'm in paradise\n\n\n\nWe should stay like this forever\n\nHow could anything be better?\n\n\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\nSo you can see me when I'm melting\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\nThey dilate when you hold me close\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\n\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\nWe should stay like this forever\n\nKiss me with your eyes open\n\nWe should stay like this forever",
