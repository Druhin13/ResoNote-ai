(Somethin I should know)\nIs it somethin (somethin), somethin I should know? (Somethin I should know)\nCause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope\nThen I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope\n\nYeah, well\n\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my shoulder to lean on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my pillow to lay on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my shoulder to cry on\nThat's what friends are for\n\nI know it's a struggle\nYou gotta flex your muscle\nDon't be scared to hustle\nThere's no reason to wrestle\nTake your time\nClear your mind\nYou know I am here for you\nDon't be scared\n\nPour out your heart\nI'll be there wherever you want\n\nIs it somethin (somethin), somethin I should know? (Somethin I should know)\nIs it somethin (somethin), somethin I should know? (Somethin I should know)\nCause I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope\nThen I feel like (feel like) you should have some hope\nYeah, well\n\nIf things don't go your way (Your way, your way, your way)\nUse my shoulder to lean on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my pillow to lay on\n\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my shoulder to cry on\nThat's what friends are for\n\nYou can tell me (Tell me, tell me)\nI'll help you when you help me\nOh baby I'll listen to you\nEverything you're goin through\nI swear I will\nI swear I will\nYou can tell me (Tell me baby)\nAnd you know you can trust me\nBaby I'll listen to you\nAnd everything you're goin through\nYou know I will\nYou know I will\n\nIf things don't go your way\n\nUse my shoulder to lean on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my pillow to lay on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my shoulder to cry on\nThat's what friends are for\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my shoulder to lean on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my pillow to lay on\nIf things don't go your way\nUse my shoulder to cry on\nThat's what friends are for",
