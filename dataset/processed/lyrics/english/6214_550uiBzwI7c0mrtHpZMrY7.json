  "lyrics": "The feast is set before me\r\nAnd the plates are platinum\r\nBut all I taste is ashes and my lips are turning numb\r\nThe smiles in the beauty and the promises I see\r\nGlory, hallelujah never said it came for free\r\nRing around the roses\n\nI see through your poses\n\nAshes to ashes\n\nIt all comes falling down\n\n\n\nI thought I would belong right here\n\nWhen I was younger\n\nBut there's something in the atmosphere\n\nWhispers of wonder\n\n\n\nI, I am a foreigner\n\nGot a fire in my soul, never gave it up\n\nAnd I know I don't belong right here\n\nI know I don't belong right here\n\nFly till I make it home\n\nThey keep my eyes to the skies even if I don't\n\nAnd I know I don't belong right here\n\nI know I don't belong right here\n\n\n\nHold out your hand of riches and display your royalty\n\nI'm fine with my bloodline in a different dynasty\n\nWorship at the altar of your vanity\n\nI'll be in the Promised Land and let You be\n\nLondon bridge is falling down\n\nMy fair lady holds her crown\n\nAshes to ashes\n\nWhere's your savior now?\n\n\n\nI thought I would belong right here\n\nWhen I was younger\n\nBut there's something in the atmosphere\n\nWhispers of wonder\n\n\n\nI, I am a foreigner\n\nGot a fire in my soul, never gave it up\n\nAnd I know I don't belong right here\n\nI know I don't belong right here\n\nFly till I make it home\n\nThey keep my eyes to the skies even if I don't\n\nAnd I know I don't belong right here\n\nI know I don't belong right here\n\n\n\nI, I fix my eyes\n\nOn the island\n\nHeavens\n\nI, I fix my eyes\n\nOn the island\n\nHeavens\n\n\n\nI, I am a foreigner\n\nGot a fire in my soul, never gave it up\n\nAnd I know I don't belong right here\n\nI know I don't belong right here\n\nFly till I make it home\n\nThey keep my eyes to the skies even if I don't\n\nAnd I know I don't belong right here\n\nI know I don't belong right here",
