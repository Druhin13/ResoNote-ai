(what?)\r\nIf that's what I wanted, then ya already know\r\nI'd hop off in my drop and get dough (get dough, let's go)\r\nThis morning\n\n{I cut the mic on before Mike Jones\n\nI had a bad flow before Magno}\n\nI'm thinkin 'bout money\n\nThis morning\n\n{I cut the mic on before Mike Jones\n\nI had a bad flow before Magno}\n\nI'm thinkin 'bout money\n\nWell let's get it then\n\n\n\n[Verse: Chamillionaire]\n\nYe-yeah, ye-yeah\n\nI cut the mic on before Mike Jones, I had a bad flow before Magno (yeah!)\n\nFreestyle before Freestyle but would kill the verses with a pad though (yeah!)\n\nStill remember when the other members of the Swishahouse didn't like me (me?)\n\nMe and Paul up against the wall, until Ben Franklin come found me (woo!)\n\nPaid in full before Paid In Full, I had a attitude, a young ragin bull\n\nStill hungry, still got the munchies, wonder why I ain't gettin full\n\nEven back in my middle school, I was killin y'all at Dominoes (HA!)\n\nWho know that'd be trainin for big sixes and countin foooo's (woo!)\n\nTell me how I'm wrong (wrong)\n\nWhen since day one I told you I get money on my own (my own)\n\nChameleon before the Chamillionaire was even known (known)\n\nI spoke it into existence, guess I'm gifted with my songs (let's go)\n\nActually, it's blasphemy if you ever said that one tape whack (what?)\n\nNo more Mixtape Messiah, I wonder what could replace that? (what?)\n\nWell I lay back in my Maybach, consider this one as payback\n\nChamillionaire talkin trash again, ha, don't you fakers just hate that?\n\nSure do, you really should, I'm still ballin, I'm still hoopin\n\nStill tippin, I'm still flippin, I'm still foreign, I'm still coupin\n\nAnybody along the way that tried to hate should feel stupid (woo!)\n\nI ain't got no love and why? I accidentally killed Cupid [gunshot]\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Chamillionaire]\n\nEvery morning, I woke up (up)\n\nThinkin 'bout money and guess what? (what?)\n\nIf that's what I wanted, then ya already know\n\nI'd hop off in my drop and get dough (get dough, let's go)\n\nThis morning, I woke up\n\nI'm thinkin 'bout money (ain't nothin change 'cause)\n\nThis morning, I woke up\n\nI'm thinkin 'bout money\n\nWell let's get it then",
