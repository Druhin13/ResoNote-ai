  "lyrics": "I never cared about the money, never really needed fame\r\nYou'd think it would have changed me but I've always been the same\r\nMy label tried to sue me, TMZ tried to sue me\r\nBlabbermouth can fuckin' suck it cause they never fuckin' knew me\r\nEverybody seems like they're waiting for me to die\n\nTalk shit behind my back, can't look me in the eye\n\nThey say I'm overrated, that I should've already faded\n\nGave a shit about it all because I love to be so hated\n\n\n\nAll in all its a good life\n\nI got what I want\n\nI can't complain (I can't complain)\n\nI'm living the good life\n\nA toast to you now\n\nIt's all sham pain (it's all sham pain)\n\n\n\nI barely get to eat and when I finally get to sleep\n\nI get drug out of bed for another meet and greet\n\nI shake the hand of every fan, put on a happy face\n\nSpread so fuckin' thin I'm all over the place\n\nI hate riding on the bus\n\nI hate flying in the planes\n\nSedate myself just to kill the pain\n\nI have no life, forgot the hope, the whole things turned into one big joke\n\n\n\nAll in all its a good life\n\nI got what I want\n\nI can't complain (I can't complain)\n\nI'm living the good life\n\nA toast to you now\n\nIt's all sham pain (it's all sham pain)\n\n\n\nI mean no disrespect but I ain't picking up the check\n\nTaking selfies on your phone while you're breathing down my neck\n\nIts getting pretty fuckin' long, and I'm almost nearly done\n\nI'm glad that you were happy as you talk to number one\n\n\n\nI'm living the good life, a toast to you now, it's all sham pain\n\n\n\nAll in all its a good life\n\nI got what I want\n\nI can't complain (I can't complain)\n\nI'm living the good life\n\nA toast to you know\n\nIt's all sham pain (it's all sham pain)",
