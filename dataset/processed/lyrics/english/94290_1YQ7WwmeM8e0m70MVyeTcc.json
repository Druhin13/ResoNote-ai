  "lyrics": "Every Sunday I see people filing in through those front doors\r\nGot a cross up on that steeple, yeah it's time to praise the Lord\r\nSome watch it on their TV, sittin' on the couch\r\nMe, I get in my old Bronco and point those headlights out\r\nOh, ain't got too many miles to go, to save my soul\n\n\n\nHey I go down and sink my feet in the water\n\nAnd I soak up that sun and I watch it set\n\nYeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel\n\nI'm as close to God as I can get\n\n\n\nNow there ain't nothing wrong with puttin' on your Sunday best\n\nMe, I won't be wearin' nothin' that I can't get wet\n\nI just think about how small I am and life after we're gone\n\nI'm out here by myself but I know I'm not alone\n\n\n\nYeah, I got all the proof I need and it sure makes me believe\n\n\n\nWhen I go down and sink my feet in the water\n\nAnd I soak up that sun and I watch it set\n\nYeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel\n\nI'm as close to God as I can get\n\n\n\nAmen\n\nI'm in heaven watchin' all these waves roll in\n\nAmen\n\nWhen I'm lost I know where to get found again\n\n\n\nYeah I go down and sink my feet in the water\n\nAnd I soak up that sun and I watch it set\n\nYeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel\n\nI'm as close to God as I can get\n\n\n\nYeah I go down and sink my feet in the water\n\nAnd I soak up that sun and I watch it set\n\nYeah, I can feel the power of the saltwater gospel\n\nI'm as close to God as I can get",
