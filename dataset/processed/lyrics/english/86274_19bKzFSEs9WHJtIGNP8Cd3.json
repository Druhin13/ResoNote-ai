  "lyrics": "I tell myself you don't mean a thing,\r\nThat what we got, got no hold on me\r\nBut when you're not there, I just crumble\r\nI tell myself I don't care that much,\r\nBut I feel like I died 'til I feel your touch\n\nOnly love, only love can hurt like this,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this\n\nMust have been a deadly kiss\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\n\n\nSay I wouldn't care if you walked away,\n\nBut every time of day, I'm begging you to stay,\n\nWhen you come close I just tremble\n\nAnd everytime, everytime you go,\n\nIt's like a knife, that cuts right through my soul,\n\nOnly love, only love can hurt like this\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\n\n\nMust have been a deadly kiss,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nYour kisses burning to my skin,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this\n\nAnd it's the sweetest pain,\n\n\n\nBurning hot through my veins,\n\nLove is torture makes me more sure,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nMust have been the deadly kiss,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\n\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nYour kisses burning to my skin,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nOnly love can hurt like this,\n\nAnd it must have been the deadly kiss",
