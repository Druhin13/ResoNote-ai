  "lyrics": "Things have been getting pretty rough around here\r\nNo coffee cups flying around the room\r\nJust daggers thrown from tears\r\nIt’s gotta crawl out from under our breath\r\nWe could never break up, so I love you to death\r\nBut man I’ve become one so comfortably dumb\n\nI believe you could mean it, but you’re not having fun\n\nAnd I’m sorry\n\n\n\nI learned to breathe I guess some time ago\n\nBut just recently I learned what it means to take it slow\n\nI’m lousy with excuses and you know I love to swear\n\nSo goddammit, I swear to whatever’s out there\n\nAnd I love you more now than I ever have, so\n\n\n\nLet’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away\n\nLet’s find some other time to break down\n\nThe storm has gone and blown on through\n\nShake off the devils a dial or two\n\nYou might leave me still, but not today\n\nFor now, can we just stay?\n\nCan we just stay?\n\n\n\nYou would think by now that I’d be fine\n\nYa’ know, like really stretching out\n\nBut it would all be lies\n\nNot in complete control of my own feelings\n\nThere they go\n\nQuickly running out of booze\n\nDrinking to kill myself to live without you\n\nOver there, where I’m still scared\n\nSometimes\n\n\n\nLet’s pick another day to call it quits and walk away\n\nLet’s find some other time to break down\n\nThe storm has gone and blown on through\n\nShake off the devils a dial or two\n\nYou might leave me still, but not today\n\nFor now, can we just stay?\n\nCan we just stay?\n\n\n\nFor now, can we just stay?\n\nCan we just stay?\n\n\n\nFor now, can we just stay?",
