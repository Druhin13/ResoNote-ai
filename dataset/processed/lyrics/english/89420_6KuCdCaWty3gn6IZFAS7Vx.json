  "lyrics": "The walls in my apartment say I'm visionary\r\nAnd tell me that I'm foolish when I'm caught\r\nBetrayal never tasted sweet until I met you\r\nBut the walls in my apartment seen it all\r\nOh, it's only luck if you save it, it's only luck\n\nTell me you love me, don't say it, it's only\n\n\n\nI don't see too well like I used to\n\nI can't feel your name on my skin\n\nHad to smoke that green like we used to\n\nTake me for a spin, spin",
