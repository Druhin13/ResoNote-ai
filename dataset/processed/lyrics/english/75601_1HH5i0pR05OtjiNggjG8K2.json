  "lyrics": "It’s how we’re engineered\r\nChemistry brings us safety\r\nYou can’t delete what we fear\r\nOur vision ever-changing\r\nTeleport to a world away\n\nWe’re leaving, retreating in a whirlwind\n\n\n\nEvery day we fucking compromise\n\nSo sick and tired of feeling that I’m not alive\n\nMy conscious blurs the line between the truth and lies\n\nFantasy, I want to live a life beyond the stars\n\nReality, always searching for an exit\n\n\n\nI wanna see the skies of other lands\n\nAnd not pretend\n\nPlease understand\n\n\n\nHuman sense, take it back\n\nProgrammed lies, system hack\n\nAll these versions of my past\n\nYearn for answers I don’t have\n\n\n\nTeleport to a world away\n\nWe’re leaving, retreating in a whirlwind\n\nI’m loosing my grip and there’s nothing to say\n\nWe’re healing, believing in our own skin\n\n\n\nOur rebellion has no end\n\n\n\nRusted shells obscure\n\nNetworks of hollow core\n\nWe’re all dead and gone\n\n(We’re dead and gone)\n\n\n\nTeleport to a world away\n\nWe’re leaving, retreating in a whirlwind\n\nI’m loosing my grip and there’s nothing to say\n\nWe’re healing, believing in our own skin\n\n\n\nWe’re all dead and gone",
