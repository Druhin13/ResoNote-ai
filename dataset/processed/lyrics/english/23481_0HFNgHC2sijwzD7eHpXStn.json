  "lyrics": "Love the illusion\r\nAdore the deception\r\nHold onto the one who's destroying you\r\nThe light shines, I walk in\r\nUnafraid to meet you on the other side\n\nGive yourself to me\n\nAll to me\n\nI welcome the ending of a story never meant to satisfy\n\nGive yourself to me\n\nAll to me\n\n\n\nAs I welcome the doubt and horror of this elegy\n\nI black out\n\nOh, her we go again\n\n\n\nThe light shines, I walk in\n\nUnafraid to meet you on the other side\n\nGive yourself to me\n\nAll to me\n\nI welcome the ending of a story never meant to satisfy\n\nGive yourself to me\n\nAll to me\n\nAll to me\n\nAll to me\n\nAll to me\n\nAll to me\n\n\n\nI wait for the darkness to appear and greet me as the night arrives\n\nAnother sick nightmare\n\nSo begins the torture of feeling alive\n\n\n\nHere's to finding a way out of this disaster",
