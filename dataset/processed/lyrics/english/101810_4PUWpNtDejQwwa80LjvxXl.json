  "lyrics": "Midnight\r\nDriving till my eyes give up\r\nHeadlights\r\nTo your apartment\r\nThis ride\r\nI done it 'bout a thousand times\n\nBut it doesn't feel right\n\nHere without you\n\n\n\nIt takes me back to windows down in ocean air\n\nSunset eyes through messy hair\n\nI miss chasing down the morning light\n\nAnd all those sleepless nights\n\n\n\nI know that it's over\n\nBut it's haunting me\n\nLike a ghost of the summer\n\nI still see\n\n\n\nMidnight drives and summer skin\n\nThe taste of liquor on your lips\n\nI miss chasing down the morning light\n\nAnd all those sleepless nights\n\n\n\nFace up\n\nWatching all the streetlights turn\n\nTo shadows\n\nIn my apartment\n\nTen months\n\nI swear, I should be fine by now\n\nBut it still gives me a head rush\n\nWhen I hear your name\n\n\n\nIt takes me back to\n\nRooftop, moonlight, silhouettes\n\nPurple skies and cigarettes\n\nI miss chasing down the morning light\n\nAnd all those sleepless nights\n\n\n\nI know that it's over\n\nBut it's haunting me\n\nLike a ghost of the summer\n\nI still see\n\n\n\nMidnight trudging, summer skin\n\nThe taste of liquor on your lips\n\nI miss chasing down the morning light\n\nAnd all those sleepless nights\n\nAll those sleepless nights\n\n\n\n(I know that it's over\n\nLike a ghost of the summer)",
