  "lyrics": "Did you spend most of your life waitin'\r\nOn a fairytale read between pages?\r\nDid you huddle up close to your boombox radio\r\nIs somebody waiting on the same song?\r\nAnd we sold our souls on the fantasies we found in records and black and white movies\n\nAnd I used to beg June to burn me alive, if that would get me anywhere but here\n\n\n\nNow Etta James, hit that symphony\n\nCause she drips through my blood like a remedy\n\nAnd for most of my sad life I figured I was gonna die alone\n\nCause I just burned in the curve of my scars\n\nTwenty long years away from your heart\n\nTil finally, finally, my love is in my arms\n\nMy love is in my arms\n\n\n\nAnd it was impossible to hold on to anything\n\nIn my chest was a lonesome, growing cyclone\n\nI kept pictures tucked up into the rear view above to the sirens all lost in the ocean\n\nAnd all we wanted was absolutely everything\n\nLike foolish, hungry young lions\n\nI was lost and alone, a million light years from home\n\nIt was nobody's fault but mine\n\n\n\nNow Etta James, hit that symphony\n\nCause she drips through my blood like a remedy\n\nAnd for most of my sad life I figured I was gonna die alone\n\nCause I just burned in the curve of my scars\n\nTwenty long years away from your heart\n\nBut finally, finally, my love is in my arms\n\n\n\nAnd was there a hole in your life?\n\nDid you kill to keep warm but somehow never quite satisfied?\n\nDo you feel like it's always time to go?\n\nAnd it's always wrong, and it's always off, and it's hard to know, which heart to hold\n\nNow do you lie to someone, is someone else, on your mind?\n\nDo you lie to someone with me on your mind?\n\n\n\nNow Etta James, hit that symphony\n\nCause she drips through my blood like a remedy\n\nAnd for most of my sad life I figured I was gonna die alone\n\nCause I just burned in the curve of my scars\n\nTwenty long years away from your heart\n\nTil finally, finally, my love is in my arms\n\nMy love is in my arms\n\n\n\nEtta James, Etta James\n\nEtta James, it's been a long time coming\n\nEtta James, Etta James\n\nEtta James, it's been a long time coming\n\n(At last, at last)\n\nEtta James, Etta James\n\nEtta James, it's been a long time coming\n\n(At last, at last)\n\nEtta James, Etta James\n\nEtta James, it's been a long time coming\n\nI could've said my love was coming 'long",
