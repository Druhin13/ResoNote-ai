  "lyrics": "So I'm back, to the velvet underground\r\nBack to the floor, that I love\r\nTo a room with some lace and pAper flowers\r\nBack to the gypsy that I was\r\nTo the gypsy... that I was\r\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nWell, you know that it does\n\nWell, lightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice\n\nAh, and it lights up the night\n\nAnd you see your gypsy\n\nYou see your gypsy\n\nTo the gypsy that remains faces freedom with a little fear\n\nI have no fear, I have only love\n\nAnd if I was a child\n\nAnd the child was enough\n\nEnough for me to love\n\nEnough to love\n\nShe is dancing away from me now\n\nShe was just a wish\n\nShe was just a wish\n\nAnd a memory is all that is left for you now\n\nYou see your gypsy\n\nYou see your gypsy\n\nLightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice\n\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nLightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice\n\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nI still see your bright eyes, bright eyes\n\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nI still see your bright eyes, bright eyes\n\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nI still see your bright eyes, bright eyes\n\n(She was just a wish)\n\n(She was just a wish)\n\nAnd it all comes down to you\n\nLightning strikes, maybe once, maybe twice\n\nAnd it all comes down to you",
