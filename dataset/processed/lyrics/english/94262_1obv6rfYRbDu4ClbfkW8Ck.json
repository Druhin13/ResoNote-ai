  "lyrics": "Way back on the radio dial,\r\nthe fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child.\r\nEvery note just wrapped around his soul,\r\nfrom steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll.\r\nOhhh, I can hear em playin.\n\nI can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar.\n\nOhhh, I can hear em singin,\n\n\"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart.\"\n\n\n\nDowntown is where I used to wander.\n\nOld enough to get there but too young to get inside.\n\nSo I would stand out on the sidewalk,\n\nlisten to the music playin every Friday night.\n\n\n\nOhhh, I can hear em playin.\n\nI can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar.\n\nOhhh, I can hear em singin,\n\n\"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart.\"\n\n\n\nSome dreams stay with you forever,\n\ndrag you around but bring you back to where you were.\n\nSome dreams keep on gettin better,\n\ngotta keep believin if you wanna know for sure.\n\n\n\nOhhh, I can hear em playin.\n\nI can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar.\n\nOhhh, I can hear em singin,\n\n\"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart.\"\n\n\n\nOhhh, I can hear em playin.\n\nI can hear the ringin of a beat up ol guitar.\n\nOhhh, I can hear em singin,\n\n\"Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart.\"\n\n\n\nKeep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart.\n\n\n\nOhhh oh oh.\n\nOhhh oh ohh.\n\n\n\nKeep on dreamin.",
