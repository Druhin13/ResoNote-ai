  "lyrics": "And now it's night\r\nBut I've seen our silhouette fade\r\nAnd weaken to grey\r\nWe used to be sharp against the light\r\nOur empathy weaponized\r\nOur history bleaching out during the day\n\n\n\nWhat you're after, what you're after\n\nErasure\n\nErasure\n\n\n\nBut we're the weeds\n\nAnd you need a path now clear for you\n\nA single golden tear for you won't fall\n\nAs if that's all we have to leave\n\nTo bleed for the blank you want to fill\n\nThe haunt you want to kill won't die\n\nCan't you see?\n\n\n\nWhat you're after, what you're after\n\nErasure\n\nErasure\n\n\n\nHate so graceless and so cavalier\n\nWe don't just disappear\n\nShifting shapes you're just an auctioneer\n\nBut we're still here\n\n\n\nWhat you're after, what you're after\n\nErasure\n\nErasure",
