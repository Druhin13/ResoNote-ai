  "lyrics": "What will you do when there's so much to lose\r\nBut you won't pay the price to go on?\r\nAnd where will you stand when there's no helping hand\r\nOr no road to deter right from wrong\r\nWhat good can it bring to ignore suffering\r\nTo shut out all the reason inside?\n\nFrom life ordinary to the heights, they get scary\n\nNo reason it can't be denied\n\n\n\nOh brother, don't you know,\n\nThe heart starts beating now?\n\nBrother, can't you see?\n\nThere is no reason now\n\n\n\nWalk between worlds, when you walk between worlds\n\nWhen you walk between worlds, we will see\n\nWhen you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds\n\nWhen you walk between worlds, you and me\n\n\n\nSo what will it bring when there's no offering\n\nThere's no music, no dreams, no way out?\n\nNo flag to unfold when you walk between worlds\n\nNo fear, no wisdom, no doubt\n\nWhat good can it bring to ignore suffering\n\nTo shut out all the rage inside?\n\nFrom life ordinary to the heights, the get scary\n\nNo reason it can't be denied\n\n\n\nOh brother, don't you know\n\nThe heart starts beating now?\n\nBrother, can't you see?\n\nThere is no reason now\n\nThere is no reason now\n\n\n\nWalk between worlds, when you walk between worlds\n\nWhen you walk between worlds, you'll see\n\nWhen you walk between worlds, when you walk between worlds\n\nWhen you walk between worlds, you and me\n\n\n\nOh brother, don't you know\n\nThe heart starts beating now?",
