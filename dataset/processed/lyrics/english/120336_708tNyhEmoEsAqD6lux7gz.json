  "lyrics": "I believe in love, I needed love\r\nI believe in love, it makes you feel like nothings wrong\r\nAnd I can see that you're in need of some\r\nSo I ain't leavin' 'til I make you feel like nothings wrong\r\nGirl I need for you to hold my hand\n\nHold my hand, hold my hand\n\nGirl I need for you to hold my hand\n\nHold my hand, hold my hand\n\n\n\nI ain't throwin' pennies in no fountain\n\nPullin' petals off of a rose\n\nI ain't gotta think about it\n\nI would already know, if there was something wrong\n\nAin't no way I could explain it\n\nEither happens or it don't\n\nAin't no room for second guessing\n\nIt's so different from before\n\nBecause there's nothin' wrong\n\nOoo-woah-woah\n\n'Cause there's nothin' wrong\n\n\n\nGirl I need for you to hold my hand\n\nHold my hand, hold my hand\n\nGirl I need for you to hold my hand\n\nHold my hand, hold my hand\n\n\n\nOnly hard to hold you in my arms babe\n\nSafest place you'll go, let me know\n\nIf there's somethin' wrong, I got you baby",
