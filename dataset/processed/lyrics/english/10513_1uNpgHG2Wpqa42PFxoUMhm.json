  "lyrics": "There's nothing funny about making money\r\nIt wouldn't work if it was\r\nThere's nothing funny about going to heaven\r\nAnd there's nothing funny about love\r\nHey! It's not dark up here\n\nHey! It's not very far\n\nHey! It's cool in my house\n\nHey! It's loud in my car\n\n\n\nIt costs money if you want to party\n\nAnd it costs money if you want to look\n\nThe Baptist church is a high school\n\nMy hairdresser, she gives me the news\n\n\n\nHey! It's not dark up here\n\nHey! It's not very far\n\nHey! It's cool in my house\n\nHey! It's loud in my car\n\n\n\nThere's only one way to read a book\n\nAnd there's only one way to watch tv\n\nWell there's only one way to smell a flower\n\nBut there's millions of ways to be free\n\n\n\nDoes winter follow spring\n\nLike night follows day\n\nMust a question have an answer\n\nCan't there be another way\n\n\n\nWould you like to talk about it\n\nWould you like to pull my hair\n\nPlants have roots\n\nBut I don't know if they're deep enough to make me stay\n\n\n\nDoes winter follow spring\n\nLike night follows day\n\nMust a question have an answer\n\nCan't there be another way\n\n\n\nHey! It's not dark up here\n\nHey! It's not very far\n\nHey! It's cool in my house\n\nHey! It's loud in my car",
