  "lyrics": "Take me where you wanna go\r\nI still feel all alone\r\nYour body's right beside me but I'm still so cold\r\nA liar, a fuck up is what I am to you\r\nI can't live in this life, even if you want me to\n\nIt's sad it comes down to this\n\nAlways around my neck\n\nCut me down or kick the chair, just go\n\nBelieve me, I’m so full of lies that I kept deep inside\n\n\n\nIt makes you seem so obsessed with the simple truth\n\nBut baby don't believe me cause I'll ruin you\n\nI'm growing sick and tired of hanging from your noose\n\nThis all just seems so far from unconditional\n\n\n\nI make you question everything\n\nThe fallen angel on your shoulder\n\nYour body’s always touching mine\n\nI just feel colder\n\nA liar, a fuck up is all I'll ever be\n\nI can't live in this life but I'm trying to set you free\n\n\n\nIt's sad it comes down to this\n\nAlways around my neck\n\nCut me down or kick the chair, just go\n\nBelieve me, I’m so full of lies that I kept deep inside\n\n\n\nIt makes you seem so obsessed with the simple truth\n\nBut baby don't believe me cause I'll ruin you\n\nI'm growing sick and tired of hanging from your noose\n\nThis all just seems so far from unconditional\n\n\n\nYou think you know what its like to be me\n\nYou think I'm just not listening\n\nYou think you know what its like to be me\n\nJust fucking let it be\n\n\n\nIt makes you seem so obsessed with the simple truth\n\nBut baby don't believe me cause I'll ruin you\n\nI'm growing sick and tired of hanging from your noose\n\nThis all just seems so far from unconditional",
