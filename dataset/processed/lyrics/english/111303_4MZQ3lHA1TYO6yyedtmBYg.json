  "lyrics": "I can still find Wiley's house\r\nRiding on my bike with eyes closed\r\nI can name every girl that he took out\r\nAnd from my memory, dial his house phone\r\nCan you take me back when we were just kids\n\nWho weren't scared of getting older? (yeah yeah)\n\n'Cause no one knows you like they know you\n\nAnd no one probably ever will\n\nYou can grow up, make new ones\n\nBut truth is there's nothing like old friends (oooh)\n\n'Cause you can't make old friends (oooh) (mmm yeah)\n\n\n\nI can still feel the windows down\n\nListening to Jimmy Eat World riding 3-wide on Blake's bench seat (yeah)\n\nMy God, it's been ten years now\n\nI would have his back tomorrow\n\nAnd he'd still fight anyone who tried to touch me\n\n\n\nCan you take me back when we were just kids\n\nWho weren't scared of getting older? (yeah yeah) (oooh)\n\n'Cause no one knows you like they know you\n\nAnd no one probably ever will\n\nYou can grow up, make new ones\n\nBut truth is there's nothing like old friends (oooh)\n\n'Cause you can't make old friends (oooh)\n\n\n\nAnd I've got some good friends now\n\nBut I've never seen their parents' back porch\n\nI wouldn't change how things turned out\n\nBut there's no one in this time zone\n\nWho knows what inline skates that I wore\n\n\n\nCan you take me back when we were just kids\n\nWho weren't scared of getting older? (oooh)\n\n'Cause no one knows you like they know you\n\nAnd no one probably ever will\n\nYou can grow up, make new ones\n\nBut the truth is\n\nThat we grow up, then wish we could go back then\n\nThere's nothing like old friends (oooh)\n\n'Cause you can't make old friends (oooh)",
