  "lyrics": "(Whatchu wanna do?)\r\nAye, feeling like that nigga these days my skin is much clearer\r\nMy woman skin is much clearer of course I'm drinkin' my water\r\nDon't spend too much time in mirrors\r\nReflections will get you caught up\r\nConnections will get you brought up in conversation\n\nYou basing everything you know about me from moments\n\nI'm more a compilation of composition it's complicated\n\nI've contemplated so many perspectives\n\nAccomodated my vices, exonerated emotions\n\nAnd then I'm copin' Macaulay Culkin\n\nI'm trappin' my demons over Bohemian Rhapsody\n\nThey draw lines in our widow's peak, we don't peak at capacity\n\nCasually givin' no fucks about your two cents\n\nWe gon' clip the loose ends, we gon' clip the split ends\n\nWe gon' split ends, we gon' burn the nooses\n\nThey try to exclude us they lie to include us\n\nMy tribe is of Judah, your kind is of Judas\n\nI ordered the seasonal Brutus among us uprooting\n\nThe fungus these niggas is leeches they learn it all from us\n\nThey fuck up the numbers\n\n\n\nDon't you get to countin' up another nigga dough\n\nDon't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow\n\nIf it's reggie then I gotta let you know, keep it that real, niggas already know\n\nDon't you get to countin' up another nigga dough\n\nDon't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow\n\nIf it's reggie then I gotta let you, gotta let you know\n\n\n\nYou got it for your niggas already\n\nWhatchu wanna do about me tellin' the truth? I get it you sensitive\n\nAnd I don't say that with malice\n\nMy intentions are pensive and poignant\n\nOpinions, annoying us they are all often informin', I'm critically Thinkin', I'm fixin' my form and my shootin' percentage is risin'\n\nI worked on my vertical simply by just switching horizons collidin' My will with the wave and niggas call me Poseidon\n\nJust call me the plug, I'm providin' the drugs, and small doses we Grindin', we rollin', we smokin', we cookin', we eatin', we focused Repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat 'til it's polished Acknowledge my genius no college degree on me, gotta few G's Wit' me, got a OZ on me, it's some OG homie don't you count the paper on me homie\n\n\n\nDon't you get to countin' up another nigga dough\n\nDon't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow\n\nIf it's reggie then I gotta let you know, keep it that real, niggas already know\n\nDon't you get to countin' up another nigga dough\n\nDon't call me a hater just because I wasn't fuckin' with the flow\n\nIf it's reggie then I gotta let you, gotta let you know\n\nI got real niggas already",
