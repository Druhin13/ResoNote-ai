  "lyrics": "Give me the strength to break through and not fade away\r\nIt’s not something you say that makes you feel safe\r\nStop pretending\r\nReset it​'​s easy to let go\r\nIt​'​s always hard to silence the echo\n\nAdmit this is reality\n\nIt​'​s telling you that you're living a fallacy\n\n\n\nBeware it defies your design\n\nOur fears will be internalized\n\nYour presence shapes this world\n\nAnd defines our hope\n\n\n\nThese impurities take a hold of me\n\nRefuse to concede\n\nI need to seek clarity\n\n\n\nI'm living on my own\n\nThese securities\n\nThe forces in my head\n\nKeep me wondering what​'​s next\n\n\n\nTasteless careless thoughts\n\nThey overwhelm my heart\n\nConvinced that I am whole\n\nI will not dissolve",
