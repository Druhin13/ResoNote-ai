  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Ether & Wood par Alela Diane\r\nFell asleep on the hardwood floor\n3 o'clock in the afternoon\nI awoke to a pale blue sky\nAnd the song of an old friend\nTook me back to our life, ooh\n\nI don't live anymore\nI don't live anymore\n\nAll the ashes of our days are ether and wood\nAll the ashes of our days are ether and wood\n\nOehohohoh oooohh\nAshes, ashes\nOehohohoh oooohh\nAshes, ashes\n\n\nI walked through the house we built\nSaw the life I left behind\nIvory paint cracked and peeled on the walls\nThe hydrangea and red rose\nStrangled by vines, ooh\n\nI don't live here anymore\nI don't live here anymore\n\nAll the ashes of our days are ether and wood\nAll the ashes of our days are ether and wood\n\nOehohohoh oooohh\nAshes, ashes\nOehohohoh oooohh\nAshes, ashes\n\n\nNext thing I knew, her spirit called\nShe took shelter in my womb\nAnd I felt her tiny feet kick me from the inside\nAnd when I looked into her dark eyes\nShe couldn't help but cry - ooh\n\nI don't live there anymore\nI don't live there anymore\n\nAll the ashes of our days are ether and wood\nAll the ashes of our days are ether and wood\n\nOehohohoh oooohh\nAshes, ashes\nOehohohoh oooohh\nAshes, ashes\nOehohohoh oooohh\nOehohohoh oooohh\n\nAshes, ashes",
