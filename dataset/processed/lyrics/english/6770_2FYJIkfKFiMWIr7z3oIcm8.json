  "lyrics": "Don't you ever question my greatness\r\nCome see the legacy this legend creating\r\nTesting my patience, your label gon' have to check for replacements\r\nThe reef a call away, I bring it out on special occasions\r\nMotha's onto me\r\nUsed to hide my work next to the vases\n\nNightmares haunting me\n\nFeeling like the last breath I was taking\n\nGod was warning me\n\nNow every morning I'm checking for faces\n\nNow that I get paid to party, I show up and bring my army\n\nBetter off safe than sorry, I'm never gonna play safaree\n\nLA nights boogie had the Lambo, I played the 'Rari\n\nSelling white and I ain't tell 'em a word when they came and charged me\n\nI never worked a shift, I got it from the first to fifth\n\nI had to learn the tricks like stuff the bags and burn the tips\n\nChristmas time I couldn't tell my daughter I ain't earned a cent\n\nI had to hit the curb and pitch, I leave and I return with gifts\n\nMade decisions to keep my momma with a place to live\n\nAnd stayed up wishing that she never seen them dinner plates was missing\n\nWhere I'm from the young wild niggas just hate to listen\n\nCause the old heads before us showed us how to make a difference\n\nI feel upset, my killers check whoever's sending threats\n\nYou still in debt, got plenty checks and I ain't get to spend 'em yet\n\nNothing in direct, I'm still a living legend in the flesh\n\nI remember deaths I couldn't cope but dog I'm still a mess\n\nBitches left and I wish 'em best\n\nI know she feel depressed\n\nYou the one it should effect\n\nYour loyalty was just a test\n\n\n\nDon, Bitch!\n\n\n\nBack to the future how I hit 'em with the flows\n\nThis coop isn't born, you need nine months to grow\n\nMarty McFly like I'm nineteen years old\n\nI'm Marty McPie sell 'em thousand dollars an O\n\nYellow gold, keep it classic\n\nBig money been around, push weight Jurassic\n\nSend your bitch to Aspen for her b-day\n\nSend your younger bitch to Coachella for bout three days\n\nSame circle pass each other like a relay\n\nYou live in, I land on, difference between our PJ's\n\nNiggas still making albums using label budgets\n\nI get it out the streets before the label touch it\n\nTake two years and tell the label fuck it\n\nMy kilos streaming in the streets without a single buzzing\n\nNever wore all saints, retired Balmain\n\nBall players turn them shits into a mall thing\n\nShowroom shop, the clerk is scrambling\n\nJW Anderson, I'm the manikin\n\nYou hybridge niggas done made me fans again\n\nAnd Don Q got y'all panicking\n\nPush",
