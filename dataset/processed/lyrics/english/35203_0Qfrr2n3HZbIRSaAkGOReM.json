  "lyrics": "Of all the money that e'er I had\r\nI spent it in good company\r\nAnd all the harm I've ever done \nAlas it was to none but me \nAnd all I've done for want of wit \nTo mem'ry now I can't recall \n\nSo fill to me the parting glass\n\nGood night and joy be to you all\n\n\n\nSo fill to me the parting glass \n\nAnd drink a health whate’er befalls \n\nAnd gently rise and softly call \n\nGood night and joy be to you all \n\n\n\nOf all the comrades that e'er I had\n\nThey're sorry for my going away\n\nAnd all the sweethearts that e'er I had\n\nThey'd wish me one more day to stay \n\nBut since it fell unto my lot\n\nThat I should rise and you should not \n\nI gently rise and softly call\n\nGood night and joy be to you all\n\n\n\nFill to me the parting glass \n\nAnd drink a health whate’er befalls \n\nAnd gently rise and softly call \n\nGood night and joy be to you all \n\n\n\nLa La\n\n\n\nBut since it fell unto my lot\n\nThat I should rise and you should not\n\nI gently rise and softly call\n\nGood night and joy be to you all\n\n\n\nSo fill to me the parting glass \n\nAnd drink a health whate’er befalls \n\nAnd gently rise and softly call \n\nGood night and joy be to you all \n\n\n\nGood night and joy be to you all.",
