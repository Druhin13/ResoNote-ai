  "lyrics": "I will make promises that I can't keep, but baby\r\nWhy can't you just stay strong for me\r\nYou give up on us every time I leave, thought this was love\r\nBut once again I have been deceived\r\nI was lost, but I found that I never needed you\n\nTill I come home to see you crying\n\n\n\nYour love is just like a trap, the way it's pulling me back\n\nYou've lost it all, your sanity, to think that you'd end up with me\n\nGo play all your selfish games and know that you're the one to blame\n\nDon't you come crawling back for help, go fall in love with someone else\n\n\n\nI fought for so long, why did I hold on\n\nI should have been gone\n\nFeels so good to see you begging\n\nBlock out the words you're saying\n\nYou can just stop your bragging\n\nI don't care\n\n\n\nYour love is just like a trap, the way it's pulling me back\n\nYou've lost it all, your sanity, to think that you'd end up with me\n\nGo play all your selfish games and know that you're the one to blame\n\nDon't you come crawling back for help, go fall in love with someone else\n\n\n\nI am shaking, my heart's breaking\n\nWhy do we do this\n\nWe know it's useless\n\nI am shaking, my heart's breaking\n\nWhy do we do this\n\nWhy do we do this",
