  "lyrics": "I feel electric when we hit the highway \nGo to the city spend some money and play\r\nI got somebody and I want them calling my name\r\nLife is so hectic and I need to relax \nMy friends they tell me that I need to cut back but I live in the moment burnt sleeves and cigarette ash\n\n\n\nCruising all summer cheap drinks fast toys take another fall for a pretty boy\n\nHe puts a spell on me, puts a spell on me, fucks me all up puts a hex on me\n\nDancing all night, ripped jeans, red eyes, take another hit tryna be a cool guy\n\nIt fits well on me, you fit well on me, fuck me all up put your hands on me\n\n\n\nOne more bottle have some fun we only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one\n\nOne more baby have some fun we only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one\n\n\n\nI‘m feeling perfect when the music‘s too loud I‘m sick of working I just want to hang out\n\nI want somebody I want a stranger in the crowd \n\nLife is so crazy and I think I am too\n\nI easily forget ‚bout people it‘s true cause I live in the moment new faces, vintage tattoos\n\n\n\nCrusing all summer cheap drinks fast toys take another fall for a pretty boy\n\nHe puts a spell on me, puts a spell on me, fucks me all up puts a hex on me \n\nDancing all night, ripped jeans, red eyes take another hit tryna be a cool guy\n\nIt fits well on me, you fit well on me, fuck me all up put your hands on me \n\n\n\nOne more bottle have some fun\n\nWe only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one\n\nOne more baby have some fun we only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one\n\nOne more bottle have some fun we only got one year to be twenty one, twenty one, twenty one\n\nOne more baby have some fun we only got one year to be twenyt one, twenty one, twenty one\n\n\n\n(Dank an Julia für den Text)",
