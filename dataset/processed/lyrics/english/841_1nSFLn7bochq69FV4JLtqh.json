  "lyrics": "Now this is a true story for the most part\nThat occurred on the top floor of this\nBigwig record executive's office in Nashville, Tennessee\nNow understand I'm not poking any fun or disrespecting anybody\nGod knows I love country music with all my heart and soul\nAnd I love the Grand Ole Opry\n\nBut I do have a problem with someone who\n\nCan't even play a D chord on a guitar\n\nTelling someone with a dream that they won't get far\n\nSo this song is dedicated to all those underdogs like me\n\nOut there running around\n\nDon't get discouraged if you have a dream\n\nDon't be afraid to chase it down\n\nIt's how it goes\n\n\n\nHe said, \"Son, don't get offended by what I'm about to say\n\nI can see you have a passion\n\nFor the songs you write and play\n\nBut you lack what we all call commercial appeal\n\nAnd you just don't have what it takes\n\nTo make it here in Nashville\"\n\n\n\nOuch\n\n\n\nWell my heart felt like a train wreck\n\nBut I wore a smile on my face\n\nI said, \"Thank you for your time, sir\"\n\nPut my guitar back in its case\n\nOur little conversation was like a revelation\n\nRedirecting my dreams\n\n'Cause God knows I'd never sell my soul to rock 'n' roll\n\nOr rap or wear those tight skinny jeans\n\n\n\n'Cause you know I'd rather sing my own songs\n\nThan be a puppet on a string\n\nI'll wear what I want to wear\n\nI'm gonna sing what I wanna sing\n\nHeaven knows all I need\n\nIs my faith, my fans, my friends and my family\n\nBesides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas\n\nThan the king of Tennessee\n\n\n\nSo I loaded up my old pickup truck\n\nAnd I drove back home to Amarillo\n\nGot a gig off old route 66\n\nAt this ballroom called The Armadillo\n\nAnd for the first thousand shows or so\n\nNot a soul showed up\n\nI thought about quitting every other day\n\nBut I just kept on kicking that cup\n\n\n\nYeah, I kept kicking that can surrounded by\n\nBlood, sweat, and beers\n\nAnd wouldn't you know I became an overnight sensation\n\nIn just over ten years\n\nAnd now I'm packing out all the dance halls\n\nAnd the rodeos every night\n\nI got a pretty wife, a ranch, a band, a bus, a boat\n\nI'd say I'm doing alright\n\n\n\nAnd you know I'd rather sing my own songs\n\nThan be a puppet on a string\n\nI'll wear what I want to wear\n\nI'm gonna sing what I wanna sing\n\nHeaven knows all I need\n\nIs my faith, my fans, my friends and my family\n\nBesides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas\n\nThan the king of Tennessee\n\n\n\nOh, how 'bout a little front porch picking, boys\n\n\n\nWell, wouldn't you know that old record man\n\nShowed up one night at this honky tonking bar\n\nAfter my show he said,\n\n\"Son, I believe you might be the next big country star\"\n\nHe said, \"We like how you keep it raw\n\nWe like how you keeping it real\n\nAnd I think you may just have what\n\nWe all like to call commercial appeal\"\n\nHuh, ain't that something\n\nWell, sir\n\n\n\nI'd rather sing my own songs\n\nThan be a puppet on a string\n\nI'll wear what I want to wear\n\nAnd I'm gonna sing what I wanna sing\n\nHeaven knows all I need\n\nIs my faith, my fans, my friends and my family\n\nBesides I'd rather be an old fence post in Texas\n\nThan the king of Tennessee\n\nGod bless Tennessee\n\nBut I'd rather be just an old fence post in Texas\n\nThan sell my soul to rock 'n' roll\n\nOr rap or wear those tight skinny jeans",
