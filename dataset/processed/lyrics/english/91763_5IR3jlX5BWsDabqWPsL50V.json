  "lyrics": "I haven't seen you for months\r\nI've been waiting up on a call\r\nFor a stranger's voice to ask if I'm sitting down\r\nNo one dare say it but we're thinking the same thing\r\nNo one dare say it but we're thinking the same thing\n\nNo heaven in front of me\n\nA neon light catastrophe\n\nNo unexpected emergency\n\nNothing's new, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu\n\nThere's no heaven in front of me\n\nA neon light catastrophe\n\nNo unexpected emergency\n\nNothing's new, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu\n\n\n\nYou've been drinking again\n\nCrashed the car and you blamed the rain (Ooh-ooh)\n\nDon't you think that you're better than that?\n\nWhat a crying shame (Ooh-ooh)\n\nAll the neighbours are out in their dressing gowns\n\nAnd the dogs have gone mad, it's all going down\n\nNo one dare say it but we're thinking the same thing\n\n\n\nNo heaven in front of me\n\nA neon light catastrophe\n\nNo unexpected emergency\n\nNothing's new, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu\n\nThere's no heaven in front of me\n\nA neon light catastrophe\n\nNo unexpected emergency\n\nNothing's new, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu\n\n\n\nOh my God, it was absolutely unlike anything I've ever experienced\n\n*Ambulance Sirens*\n\nWe wanna get everyone on the same page\n\nAnd then it just started going down from there\n\n\n\nNo heaven in front of me\n\nA neon light catastrophe\n\nNo unexpected emergency\n\nNothing's new, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu\n\n\n\nNo heaven in front of me\n\nA neon light catastrophe\n\nNo unexpected emergency\n\nNothing's new, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu, déjà vu",
