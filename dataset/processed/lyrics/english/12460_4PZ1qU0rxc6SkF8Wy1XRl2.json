  "lyrics": "Through the fall of creation\r\nA death mask transforms the past\r\nThe contours of a labyrinth emerge\r\nAs dusk it clings to silent stone\r\nDead to all future generations\n\n\n\nLet their strength now dissolve\n\nThe sun to me is dark forever\n\nA nihilistic urge\n\nAs death thickens in their throats\n\n\n\nLike fragments of silent fires\n\nLike fragments of silent fires\n\n\n\nThe distorted hierarchies\n\nUnder boiling clouds\n\nA cold stare, bound in stone\n\nBehind the curtain of dust\n\n\n\nAs dusk it clings to silent stone\n\nImmortalizing the suppression\n\n\n\nLet their strength now dissolve\n\nThe sun to me is dark forever\n\nA nihilistic urge\n\nAs death thickens in their throats\n\n\n\nFeatureless, elusive\n\nDrowning in the silent black\n\nObsession like wildfire inhaled\n\n\n\nLike fragments of silent fires\n\nLike fragments of silent fires\n\nLike fragments of silent fires\n\nLike fragments of silent fires\n\nLike fragments of silent fires",
