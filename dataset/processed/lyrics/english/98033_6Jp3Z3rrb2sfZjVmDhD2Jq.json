  "lyrics": "It's quiet\r\nIn this house upon a hill\r\nYou won't mind it\r\nSome things you can't know till you're still\r\nIn the silence\r\nWhere your spinning thoughts slow down\n\nIn the stillness\n\nThings have a way of working out\n\n\n\nAllow Me to introduce Myself again\n\nI'm the One that knew you before time began\n\nI've been waiting for you to let Me be your friend\n\nEverything you ever need is everything I am\n\nI Am, I Am, I Am\n\n\n\nTake your chances\n\nThere's nothing here to lose\n\nAsk your questions\n\nI promise you the truth\n\nAs you're ready\n\nI want to hear your heart\n\nIs it heavy\n\nWhere wounds have left a mark?\n\n\n\nAllow Me to introduce Myself again\n\nI was with you every place you've ever been\n\nI'm the One that held you when you couldn't stand\n\nIf you're wondering who can heal your brokenness\n\nI can, I can, I can\n\n\n\n\n\nI'll meet you\n\nIn the house upon the hill\n\nHow I want to\n\nShow you I am real\n\n\n\nAllow Me to introduce Myself again\n\nI'm the Love you used to think could not exist\n\nI'm as sure as where you're standing and as free as the wind\n\nYou don't have to reach for Me, 'cause this is where I am\n\nI Am, I Am, I Am\n\n\n\nI Am, I Am, I Am",
