  "lyrics": "Yeah yeah, I've heard it before\r\nIt's just a bunch more words that I'm sure to ignore\r\nThis time I'll need evidence, you know exhibit A\r\nAnd if it's secret, leak it, give it away\r\nYou'll drop hints, but never a fact\r\nAnd it's a trap, gonna have to do better than that\n\nI don't wanna be a fool, I'm feeling naive\n\nSo please write it all down, leave it easy to read\n\nIn clear, concise, nice plain English\n\nI get tripped up trying to distinguish\n\nThe pimp from the pastor, meek from the moocher\n\nSo tell me then, are you a friend or a user\n\nWho sets a trap like a web to a fly\n\nSo come right and exact, look me dead in the eye\n\nAnd don't sell me, promise me, tell me\n\nHonestly, why\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nCan you give me some kind of sign\n\nA meaning defined so I can believe\n\nCan you give me a way to be sure\n\nI can trust in your word\n\nCause that's what I need\n\nCan you give me a reason for change\n\nYou'll need to explain so I can believe\n\nCan you give me a moment of truth\n\nAnd indisputable proof cause that's what I need\n\n\n\nBecause I wanna believe, I wanna believe\n\nBecause I wanna believe, I wanna believe\n\n\n\nOk I made my point, I'll need to see it to believe it\n\nAnd anyway, faith is so inconvenient\n\nDealing with the guilt, feeling hypocritical\n\nI just end up being sick and miserable\n\nLife's fast, I need to try to maximize\n\nSelf gratify, till I collapse and die\n\nWhat then, I don't wanna think about it\n\nIt's too deep, I gotta keep my head clouded\n\nSo give me entertainment and happy pills\n\nAnd we'll pretend it's all sunshine and daffodils\n\nIt's what I've done since I was two years old\n\nAnd if it's true you can lose your soul\n\nWell I just laugh at your statement of facts\n\nDon't say absolute, you'll get taken to task\n\nI don't really wanna change and my life is in vain\n\nThen I ask\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nBecause I wanna believe, but I don't wanna believe\n\nBecause I wanna believe, but I don't wanna believe\n\nI wanna believe, but I don't wanna believe\n\n\n\nEinstein take me on outta here",
