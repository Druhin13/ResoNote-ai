Sweet dream, other side\r\nNow that I’ve opened my eyes\r\nThis world can’t hold me down\n\n\n\nThis beat, like a rusted key\n\nIt fades to silence in my mind\n\nGuess there’s no turning back time\n\nNo going back now\n\n\n\nBroken days are over - Forever\n\n(Hey baby why?)\n\nThey always have followed me out though\n\n(I want to cry)\n\nMy fear has been relentlessly\n\nBeating this fight inside me\n\nFrom my fate, I won’t run away\n\nNo way – cause I’m not alone!\n\n\n\nBaby, if you’re by my side\n\nIt doesn’t matter what happens next\n\nMy dreams could turn to grey –\n\nThey could fade away\n\nLet me be the one to share the tears in your eyes\n\nBaby, I pray– and I believe\n\nWe’ll tear apart the darkness\n\nIn your icy dreams completely\n\n\n\nLa la la la ah\n\n\n\nMy broken wings were resting\n\nInside the spring when suddenly\n\nYou jumped in, sending a wave - Much to my disbelief\n\n\n\nThis dull world’s getting to me\n\nWith its mundane anxiety\n\nThese things will always exist for you to brush off\n\n\n\nLook up at the night sky – And you’ll find\n\n(Baby … for you)\n\n\n\nA reason to keep your head held high\n\n(I’m here for you)\n\nSo pack away those nagging thoughts\n\nAnd shove them in your suitcase\n\nNow catch your breath - and take a step\n\nTo clear this hate in your heart\n\n\n\nListen to the storm\n\nIn all the falling raindrops, you’ll hear a song\n\nWhenever you are sad\n\nKnow I’ve got your back\n\nI’ll only be a call away to shield the darkness\n\nBaby …So please always believe\n\nBecause inside your eyes I see\n\nA miracle is shining\n\n\n\nAhh Ahh Ahh Ahh\n\n\n\nHey baby why? I want to cry …\n\nHey baby why?\n\n\n\n“Hey baby why? I wanna cry …”\n\nI’m here for you … So, believe in yourself\n\n\n\nBaby, if you’re by my side\n\nIt doesn’t matter what happens next\n\nMy dreams could turn to grey – They could fade away\n\nYeah, all these memories\n\nI wanna share forever with you\n\nI pray –so answer me\n\nAnd let me in that heart of yours\n\n\n\nLet me be the one to share the tears in your eyes\n\nBaby, I pray– and I believe\n\nWe’ll tear apart the darkness\n\nIn your icy dreams completely",
