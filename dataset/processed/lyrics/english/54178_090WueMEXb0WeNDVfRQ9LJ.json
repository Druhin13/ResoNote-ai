  "lyrics": "My desire to remain\r\nIs all that I have left\r\nAs I let go\r\nAnd I don’t wanna play this game\r\nBut I don’t have a choice\r\nI’ve been ripped from my home\n\nMy flesh & bone\n\n\n\nSo I’ll scream your name\n\nWith the only breath I have\n\nSo I’ll scream your name\n\nWith the only breath I have left\n\n\n\nMy reflection in the glass\n\nBut I don’t recognize\n\nWhat I see (what’s left of me?)\n\nPlease don’t leave me with my past\n\nMy frailties exposed\n\nIn my last dance\n\nThere’s one more chance\n\n\n\nSo I’ll scream your name\n\nWith the only breath I have\n\nSo I’ll scream your name\n\nWith the only breath I have left\n\n\n\nWill my friends be there to greet me around the bend?\n\nWill they know my face, lend their grace as I ascend?\n\nAnd Dylan said\n\nAt the end\n\nWise men know\n\nThe dark is right\n\nSee the birds in flight\n\nBut they burn & rage\n\nBurn at the end of the day\n\nIn rage\n\n“Rage, rage against the dying of the light\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night”\n\n\n\nSo I’ll scream your name",
