  "lyrics": "Heading for the last roundup\r\nHardware at hand\r\nI was told to protect and serve\r\nBut I'm here to supply a demand\r\nLike roaring free jazz fireworks\r\nFollow its beat\n\nDancing to the sound of the enemy's guns\n\nBoogie as we drop one by one\n\n\n\nAn abstract notion\n\nThat I'm flagless at last\n\nI'm not fighting for a country\n\nI'm fighting to outlast\n\nI found there to be an instinct\n\nOur inherent tissue\n\nJump off the diving board and cannonball\n\nInto the bottom of the genetic pool\n\n\n\n'Cause we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\nNo, we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\nA carpet bomb a lethal dose\n\nShotgun blow that bastard home\n\n'Cause we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\n\n\nSome are awarded shell shock\n\nOr the loss of a limb or two\n\nYou'll just have to take heart\n\nIf it hasn't already been taken from you\n\nPatrimonial heritage\n\nThe urge is there from the start\n\nThere is always something there beneath\n\nShedding the sheep cloth and baring its teeth\n\n\n\nAll the boys are at action\n\nAcross the two hemispheres\n\nOh yes, we're living it large\n\nSupplied with big-ticket gear\n\nPardon me, good sir\n\nI consider myself a peaceful man\n\n\n\nBut I got orders to make you flee your home\n\nSplit your family and pillage your town\n\n'Cause we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\nNo, we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\nA carpet bomb a lethal dose\n\nShotgun blow that bastard home\n\n'Cause we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\n\n\nBecause we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah\n\nNo, we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah-rah-rah\n\nA carpet bomb a lethal dose\n\nShotgun blow the bastards home\n\n'Cause we can't stop killing\n\nAnd we'll never stop killing\n\nAnd we shouldn't stop killing\n\nHurrah",
