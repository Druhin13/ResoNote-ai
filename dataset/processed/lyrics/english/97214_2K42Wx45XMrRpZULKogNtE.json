  "lyrics": "I'm not afraid of getting older\r\nI'm one less day from dying young\r\nI see the light go past my shoulder\r\nI'm one less day from dying young\r\nI see my life like a train on a oneway track\n\nI've made mistakes and I couldn't take 'em back\n\nAnd I've been runnin' round in circles till I'm dizzy I can't lie\n\nBut every night I go to sleep's a day that I survived\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of getting older\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI see the light go past my shoulder\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\n\n\nAnd I've seen my friends fall away before their time\n\nAnd I've been afraid that I may follow in their light\n\nSo I drink and love and whisper all the things I know are right\n\nSomeday I will leave this world but maybe not tonight\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of getting older\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI see the light go past my shoulder\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\n\n\nAll my life I have been wondering\n\nBurnin' up my candle like my time just won't end\n\nAnd I'll keep burnin' till there's nothin' left\n\nPrayin' that tomorrow I can do it all again\n\nAnd if I get tomorrow I will do it all again\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of getting older\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI see the light go past my shoulder\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\n\n\nI'm not afraid of getting older\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI see the light go past my shoulder\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\n\n\n(I'm one less day from dying young\n\nI see the light\n\nI'm one less day from dying young\n\nI'm one less day from dying young)",
