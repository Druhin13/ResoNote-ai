  "lyrics": "What did you plan?\r\nWhat did you anticipate?\r\nAll you demand to find\r\nSpiraling down, falling behind\r\nNo tomorrow\r\nWhen you're ahead of your time\n\nWhat did you want to know?\n\nHow does it end? How does it go?\n\n\n\nFrom the bottom I fled\n\nBut the stars overhead\n\nLet me wake from the ruin\n\nI must say that I was a wreck\n\nHit the bottom I guess\n\nBut the words you once said\n\nLet me wake from the ruin\n\nSecond sight up ahead\n\n\n\nI couldn't withstand\n\nI couldn't anticipate\n\nHow low I would go\n\nWhat did I miss?\n\nI didn't know, I didn't know\n\nNow what do you anticipate?\n\nAnother catastrophe\n\nComing around, following me\n\n\n\nFrom the bottom I fled\n\nBut the stars overhead\n\nLet me wake from the ruin\n\nI must say that I was a wreck\n\nHit the bottom I guess\n\nBut the words you once said\n\nLet me wake from the ruin\n\nSecond sight up ahead",
