  "lyrics": "A heart on the run keeps a hand on the gun you can’t trust anyone\r\nI was so sure what I needed was more tried to shoot out the sun\r\nDays when we raged, we flew off the page such damage was done\r\nBut I made it through, cause somebody knew I was meant for someone\r\nSo girl, leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leaving this room\r\nTill someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom\n\nIt’s cold in this house and I ain’t going out to chop wood\n\nSo cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good\n\nPut your faith to the test when I tore off your dress in Richmond on high\n\nBut I sobered up and I swore off that stuff forever, this time\n\nAnd the old lovers sing “I thought it’d be me who helped him get home”\n\nBut home was a dream, one I’d never seen till you came along\n\nSo girl, hang your dress up to dry we ain’t leaving this room\n\nTill Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through\n\nAnd carries this house on the stones like a piece of driftwood\n\nCover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good\n\nSo girl, leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leaving this room\n\nTill someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom\n\nIt’s cold in this house and I ain’t going out to chop wood\n\nSo cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good\n\nCover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good",
