  "lyrics": "I know I came home late\r\nAnd I didn’t call\r\nDidn’t want to complicate\r\nDidn’t want to hit the wall\r\nThe words I said only went so far when you were all alone\r\nWe lost our way now we’ve both been tossed into the great unknown\n\n\n\nMoving on\n\nSaid you’re moving on\n\nSaid you couldn’t take the reminders\n\nSad songs always coming on\n\nCouldn’t ever put it behind you\n\n\n\nKnew I’d always be walking that endless line\n\nKnew that I’d be right there\n\nNo I’m going nowhere\n\nNo I didn’t ever mind you\n\nTaking up all my time\n\nYou were still good to me too\n\nYou were too good to be true\n\n\n\nI know I can’t stop fate\n\nAnd I don’t recall\n\nWhatever I said too late\n\nDidn’t matter after all\n\nMistakes were made but the debts were paid and that’s all I know\n\nBut the shifting tide always took its time bringing me back home\n\n\n\nWoah woah woah woah baby say it ain’t so\n\nBaby say it ain’t so, I wanna know\n\nOoh ooh ooh ooh Can I count on you?\n\nCan I count on you? Are we pushing on through?\n\nCan I count on you? Are we pushing on through?\n\nBaby we both knew, baby we both knew",
