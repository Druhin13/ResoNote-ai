  "lyrics": "Oh, oh\r\nNow you're gone, I'm left to pick up the pieces\r\nOf a broke-broken heart you shattered\r\nExploded when you left us\r\nScar, rip, tear and fracture\n\nYou left a big disaster\n\nThere were so many questions\n\nThat we can never answer\n\n\n\nI built this paper castle\n\nI'll be the one to burn it down\n\nThey'll just forget what happened\n\nBefore the ashes hit the ground\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\n\n\nYou were so golden that\n\nWe forgot you're human and\n\nIn, in that second\n\nEven the gods can bleed\n\nSmash, crash into the ground\n\nYou weren't even fucking around\n\nI wish you only knew\n\nWe were all here to catch you\n\nWe would've carried you\n\n\n\nI built this paper castle\n\nI'll be the one to burn it down\n\nThey'll just forget what happened\n\nBefore the ashes hit the ground\n\n\n\nWhat you've taken, we can't take back\n\nNo there won't be a replacement\n\nWhat a waste we couldn't face this\n\nSo lets face it, we must face this\n\nFind a reason to keep good faith in\n\nWhat's left of this half-life\n\nAffected by a life cut short\n\n\n\nI built this paper castle\n\nI'll be the one to burn it down\n\nThey'll just forget what happened\n\nBefore the ashes hit the ground\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down\n\nLet's burn it down",
