  "lyrics": "There ain't a damn man in Dallas\r\nWho wouldn't put a ring on my hand\r\nRed dirt queen of the palace\r\nI'm runnin' through 'em like a watering can\r\nMy sugar daddy's got a pool in the back\n\nGot a rifle in the rack of his Cadillac\n\nDrivin' me crazy\n\nMy sugar daddy's got diamonds in his watch\n\nGot a boat on the dock, 'cause a-why not?\n\nI'm his lady\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\n\n\nThere ain't a horse in all of Kentucky\n\nThat I couldn't saddle up and ride\n\nI'm bettin' on the one with the honey\n\nI'm gonna break him in good tonight\n\n\n\nMy sugar daddy's got chrome on his bike\n\nGot bourbon on ice, he's a [white knight?]\n\nDrivin' me crazy\n\nMy sugar daddy's got a lift kit on his truck\n\nHe's as wild as a buck\n\nAnd he thanks God I'm his baby\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\n\n\nI can call 'em down from the mountain\n\nI can leave 'em high on the hog\n\nI let 'em drink from the fountain\n\nBut leave 'em wantin' more like a boss\n\n\n\nYeah my sugar daddy's got the whole back forty\n\nWith the will to afford it\n\nAnd he's top shelf, drivin' me crazy\n\nMy sugar daddy's got a rhinestone suit\n\nGot a snake in his boot\n\nA guitar man, he persuades me\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\n\n\nIf you want them finer things\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\nIf you want them diamond rings\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\nHowlin' darlin', do your thing\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\nGive me some sugar daddy\n\nGive me some sugar daddy",
