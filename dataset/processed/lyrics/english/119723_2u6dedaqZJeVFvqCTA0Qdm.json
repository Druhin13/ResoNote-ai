  "lyrics": "Where did it go, the love that we shared?\r\nGuess we'll never know\r\nIs it hidden behind that velvet rope?\r\nWhile I'm standing alone out in the cold\r\nWhere did you go?\r\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nDo your new friends know that it's all for show\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nOr did you fool them all into thinking you're gold?\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nDid you do as you're told? Will it ever get old?\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n\n\nDon't you remember me, darling?\n\nWhen you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?\n\n'Cause I remember you, darling\n\nWithout the sadness in your eyes\n\nNow the champagne's running dry\n\n\n\nI heard that you been living it up, living it up\n\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\nOnly yesterday, you were beside me, -side me\n\nNow I'm just another one\n\nYou're the one who's giving it up, giving it up\n\nSinging that same song\n\nYou're the only one I want beside me, -side me\n\nNow I'm just another one\n\nSinging that same song\n\n\n\nYou were so high\n\nI bet you felt you could touch the sky\n\nNow you reached the top, was it worth the climb?\n\nOh, what did you find? Would you leave it behind?\n\nIf I were to say\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nThat since you've been gone it isn't the same\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nThat maybe I'm wrong and I've made a mistake\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nBy letting you go so far away\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nDon't you remember me, darling?\n\nWhen you lay down to sleep, do you still think of me?\n\n'Cause I remember you, darling\n\nWithout the sadness in your eyes\n\nNow the champagne's running dry (Oh, oh, oh, oh)\n\n\n\nI heard that you been living it up, living it up\n\nWhere did I go wrong?\n\nOnly yesterday, you were beside me, -side me\n\nNow I'm just another one\n\nYou're the one who's giving it up, giving it up\n\nSinging that same song\n\nYou're the only one I want beside me, -side me\n\nNow I'm just another one (Ooh)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n\n\nSinging that same song, yeah (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nNow I'm just another one (Come on, ooh)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nClap with me now\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nSinging that same song (Ooh, ooh)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nYou're the only one I want beside me, -side me\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nNow I'm just another one\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\n\n\nI heard that you been living it up, living it up (Oh, no)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nWhere did I go wrong? (Yeah, yeah)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nOnly yesterday, you were beside me, -side me\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nNow I'm just another one (You know that I know that I know it feels right, yeah, yeah)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nYou're the one who's giving it up, giving it up (Oh, no)\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nSinging that same song\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nYou're the only one I want beside me, -side me\n\n(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)\n\nNow I'm just another one (Oh)",
