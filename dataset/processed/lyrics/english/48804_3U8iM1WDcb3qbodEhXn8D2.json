  "lyrics": "Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,\nYou may see a stranger across a crowded room,\nAnd somehow you know, you know even then,\nThat somehow you'll see here again and again.\n\nSome enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,\n\nYou may hear her laughing across a crowded room,\n\nAnd night after night, as strange as it seems,\n\nThe sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.\n\n\n\nWho can explain it, who can tell you why?\n\nFools give you reasons, wise men never try.\n\n\n\nSome enchanted evening, when you find your true love,\n\nWhen you hear her call you across a crowded room,\n\nThen fly to her side and make her your own,\n\nOr all through your life you may dream all alone.\n\n\n\nOnce you have found her, never let her go,\n\nOnce you have found her, never let her go.",
