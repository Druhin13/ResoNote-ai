  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Burn par Too Close To Touch\r\nDeep as the thoughts you left in me\nI never meant to keep them in my head\nI’m just the way you knew you left me\nLooking at the hands that kept me back\n\nI’ve been wasting all the ways, I\nCould have brought you back\nBut thats okay I, yesterday\nI'll care a little less\n\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the lies that you didn’t believe\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the faith that you had in me\nI know we both say you’ll never save me\nI think its time to leave\n\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the lies that you didn’t believe\nI wanna just burn\n\nDeep in the cracks you left in me\nI barely believed it keeps me safe\nMore than a phase I am done pretending\nWhy try to hide this fragile state\n\nI’ve been wasting all the ways, I\nCould have brought you back\nBut thats okay I, yesterday\nI'll care a little less\n\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the lies that you didn’t believe\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the faith that you had in me\n\nI know we both say you’ll never save me\nI think its time to leave\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the lies that you didn’t believe\nI wanna just burn\n\nI’ve been wasting all the ways, I\nCould have brought you back\nBut thats okay I, yesterday\nI'll care a little less\n\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the lies that you didn’t believe\nI wanna just burn\nAll of the faith that you had in me\nI know we both say you’ll never save me\nI think its time to leave\nI wanna just burn\n\nAll of the lies that you didn’t believe\nI wanna just burn",
