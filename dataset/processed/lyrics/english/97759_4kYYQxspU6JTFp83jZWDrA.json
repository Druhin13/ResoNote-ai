  "lyrics": "And when you may try to hide away\r\nWhy do you hide away?\r\nWhy do you hide away?\r\nFeeling like there’s no room left for me\r\nFeeling like there’s nothing left\r\nAnd there’s nothing more\n\n\n\nUsed to give a fuck\n\nThat was just an old phase\n\nYou and me were close, now you further than the old days\n\nSometimes I wonder why I’m heading towards a cold place\n\nThey like “Lemme fix you,” I don’t fuck with Coldplay ay\n\nWish I could forget\n\nI cannot forgive yeah\n\nEvery step, I gotta relive\n\nTake a breath\n\nFeel it in my ribs yeah\n\nLet my voice fade into the mist\n\n\n\nI been talking to the man sitting on my left shoulder\n\nHe said everything just gets worse when your older\n\nI just pulled up to the function, can’t even function\n\nNo nothing, I don’t know nothing\n\n\n\nI’m not one of you\n\nI said I’m not\n\nI only fucked with you because I want a spot\n\nNow that’s what I got\n\nBut with it went the plot\n\nI checked the big picture, now that shit is getting cropped\n\nYeah I’ve been feeling what I want is something less\n\nFeel like a sellout that ain’t made a fucking cent\n\nGuess I shoulda up and left\n\nBut I always tell myself that I’m one of the good guys\n\nWell maybe that’s a good lie\n\nEverything looking like ashes\n\nI don’t wanna car I imagine it crashes\n\nThe man on my shoulder, he told me what happens\n\nThe glass is half empty? It actually shatters\n\nHe told me don’t look in the mirror without me\n\nHe said the world would be clearer without me\n\nThe man on my shoulder I think I believe him\n\nI really don’t want him, I think that I need him\n\n\n\nI been talking to the man sitting on my left shoulder\n\nHe said everything just gets worse when your older\n\nI just pulled up to the function, can’t even function\n\nNo nothing, I don’t know nothing\n\n\n\n*Ablib scratch*\n\n\n\nI get too happy for money\n\nThey all wanna back me for money\n\nI put them hunnids all over my face\n\nNow I got acne for money haha\n\nI got it all in my bank\n\nI treat that shit like it’s nothing\n\nI treat that shit like it’s nothing\n\nI turned that nothing to something\n\nI put them bands on my face\n\nThat won’t make the man go away\n\nShe put her hands on my waist\n\nBut he still standing in place\n\nI wish I had more voices in my head to counteract you\n\nI think that’s why I have to sing about you\n\n\n\nUsed to give a fuck\n\nThat was just an old phase\n\nYou and me were close, now you further than the old days\n\nSometimes I wonder why I’m heading towards a cold place\n\nThey like “Lemme fix you,” I don’t fuck with coldplay ay\n\nWish I could forget\n\nI cannot forgive yeah\n\nEvery step, I gotta relive\n\nTake a breath\n\nFeel it in my ribs yeah\n\nLet my voice fade into the mist\n\n\n\nI been talking to the man sitting on my left shoulder\n\nHe said everything just gets worse when your older\n\nI just pulled up to the function, can’t even function\n\nNo nothing, I don’t know nothing\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a foot out the door\n\nAnd the other one sunk in the floor, floor, floor\n\nI was checking out of the store\n\nI wonder who I’m doing this for, for, for\n\nI was zoning out in my class\n\nI love her but I wish that she asked, asked, asked\n\nMade too many shitty songs in the past\n\nI hope my first impression wasn’t the last\n\nI hope there’s plenty more, I hope this isn’t the last\n\nBut if it is do me a favor and make sure that it lasts\n\nIt lasts forever\n\nI’d be lying if I said I didn’t have regrets\n\nEven from when they thought my life forgot to matter less\n\nI started looking in the mirror for my eyes and not my hair\n\nRealized I’ll be alone it do not matter if your there\n\nI still feel it\n\nI still talk to the man on my shoulder\n\nNo matter who’s hands on my shoulder, I’m the man in the corner\n\nI know the answer but I can’t seem to fill in the bubble\n\nI think I need to get outta mine\n\nI like to think about what life will be like down the line\n\nBut that’s misleading, cause a line is infinite and not about to die at any minute\n\nI think I love her but I’ll never tell\n\nI won’t admit it\n\nAnd that’s my problem I won’t solve em, I won’t go the distance\n\nI’ll just regress into a mess and so I hope you listen\n\nI hope you notice I’m my lowest, hope you know the difference\n\nI said let’s never speak again, maybe I spoke too soon\n\nBut now these words been feeling broken\n\nThey got no more room\n\nThey get consumed by their own dust and leave a hopeless tune\n\nWhat do I do? Ain’t got no closure for this open wound\n\nAin’t got not closure, but the man on my shoulder yeah",
