  "lyrics": "Just a drop in the ocean\r\nTrapped in one thought\r\nBeen through the motions\r\nBeen here before\r\nPicked up the pieces that fell apart\r\nRebuild and recreated every broken heart\n\nIt's easy to lose all that inner faith\n\nWhen I see the cracks in the home I made\n\nI start to lose my focus\n\nI'm losing ground\n\nI get so high up\n\nBut always get so down\n\n\n\nI've worked too hard\n\nMy head and\n\nMy heart got me this far\n\nI'll wear these scars\n\nOn my sleeves\n\nReal proud\n\nLike my broken heart\n\n\n\nCause all I want is another chance\n\nA new beginning\n\nAnd I just want to make new waves\n\nAnd find a new way out\n\n\n\nSometimes I am weightless\n\nJust drifting\n\nThrough this life unconcious\n\nA wanderer chasing a dream\n\nWalking the edges of reality\n\nIs it just me?\n\n\n\nI don't need another bug in my brain\n\nTo feel transiently okay\n\nI'm off all those prodigal old ways\n\nI found a new start\n\nOn new waves\n\n\n\nI've worked too hard\n\nMy head\n\nAnd my heart got me this far\n\nI'll wear these scars\n\nOn my sleeves\n\nReal proud\n\nLike my broken heart\n\n\n\nCause all I want is another chance\n\nA new beginning\n\nAnd I just want to make new waves\n\nAnd find a new way out\n\n\n\nI don't need another bug in my brain\n\nJust wanna feel myself again\n\nI'm off all those prodigal old ways\n\nI made a new start\n\nOn new waves\n\n\n\nBecause I've worked too hard\n\nYou know I've come too far\n\nAnd I'll wear my scars\n\nReal proud just like my\n\n\n\nCause all I want is another chance\n\nJust a new beginning\n\nAnd I just want to make new waves\n\nAnd find a new way out\n\n\n\nAll I want is another chance\n\nA new day\n\nA new life\n\nI wanna get out\n\nAnd I just want to make new waves\n\nAnd find a new way out",
