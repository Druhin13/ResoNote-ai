  "lyrics": "I am walking down that road\r\nWhere did all the flowers go?\r\nThey say we're supposed to grow\r\nLearning from the highs and low\r\nAll eyes lying on me, oh\r\nBegging me to play the role\n\n'Cause I'm gonna get it right, I'm gonna get it right\n\n\n\nThey can try to hold me down, but I am\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\nWhen the sky is filled with smoke and fire\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\nAll I want is something better in the purple light\n\nThey can try to hold me down, but I am\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\n\n\nSwitchin' lanes, four doors feelin' like Jeezy\n\nUndercover sweater, Balmain, boots Yeezy\n\nSummer feelin' winter, feelin' rappin' like I’m Weezy\n\nLord forgive me ain’t no prayin when it hit the fan, Jesus\n\nCancun chillin' by the pool, I can feel it\n\nAlmost hit my goal but I still hit loose women\n\nDueces up, ain’t nobody reaching you, baby\n\nAin’t nobody stoppin' you, baby\n\n\n\nYou try to hold me down, but I am\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\nWhen the sky is filled with smoke and fire\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\nAll I want is something better in the purple light\n\nThey can try to hold me down, but I am\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\n\n\nI'm gonna get it right\n\nI'm gonna get it right",
