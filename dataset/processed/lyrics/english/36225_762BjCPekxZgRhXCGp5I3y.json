  "lyrics": "After the blood, After the tears have fallen down like rain\nA loaded gun shot through the years and heaven was to blame\nI'll take on all your shattered dreams\nI'd give you almost anything\nA chance to rise above the fog\nI swear these words are true. I believe in you\n\n\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI promise right here. Right now\n\nI won't let you down\n\n(Woah)\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nOur faith will silence the doubt\n\nI won't let you down\n\n\n\n(Woah)\n\n\n\nThe serpent's touch has made it clear that evils on it's way\n\nThis desert land of broken mirrors, we live another day\n\nI'll become all your blasphemy. A war that's fought with\n\ntragedy\n\nThe scars we've left along these walls\n\nI swear these words are true. I believe in you.\n\n\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI promise right here. Right now\n\nI wont let you down\n\n(Woah)\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nOur faith will silence the doubt\n\nI won't let you down\n\n\n\n(Woah)\n\n\n\nIn the dead of night we'll rise of one for the fight\n\nThe sun ignites the spirit back to our lives\n\nI won't ever let you down\n\nI won't ever let you down\n\n(I believe in you)\n\n\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nI promise right here. Right now\n\nI won't let you down\n\n(Woah)\n\nI'll never let you down\n\nOur faith will silence the doubt\n\nI won't let you down\n\n\n\n(Woah)\n\n\n\nI won't let you down",
