  "lyrics": "Her and her friends piled into a Camry\r\nHeaded downtown, got in for free\r\nShe's all dolled up, looking VIP\r\nWalked in, found a booth, took a seat\r\nWiped the tear from the corner of her eye\r\nFaked a smile to the Corona guy\n\nUsually she wouldn't give him the time of day\n\nBut hey, in here tonight\n\n\n\nShe don't wanna feel nothing real\n\nShe just want somebody to give her attention\n\nFor a minute, call her beautiful\n\nShe ain't trying to wind up in love\n\nShe's just trying to burn some time up\n\nOn a Friday night in the neon light\n\nYeah, he hurt her soul\n\n\n\nShe just needs a hero to save her\n\nFrom being all alone\n\nFrom paying for a drink she don't want\n\nNothing more than a dance or two\n\nShe's feeling blue\n\nBut she just needs a hero, mm\n\nAnd she just needs a hero\n\n\n\nHe's all geared up for his football game\n\nHe's wearing his jersey with the same last name\n\nA still reminder of the guy that ain't around these days\n\nAnd his mama's up in them momentum stands\n\nSaying 'run, baby run', she's his number one fan\n\nDoing the best she can\n\nBut wondering why his daddy can't be a better man\n\n\n\nHe just wants to feel what kids feel\n\nWalking off the football field\n\nAfter winning, for a minute\n\nIn his daddy's pads\n\nThe kid should never have to wonder\n\nIf his old man even loves him\n\nOn a Friday night under Friday lights\n\nShouldn't be so sad\n\n\n\nThat should be his hero\n\nThat left him and his mama all alone\n\nBarely even calls him on the phone\n\nEvery year in March, sends a birthday card\n\nBut he just needs a hero, mm\n\nYeah, he just needs a hero\n\n\n\nThere's an old white haired preacher man\n\nWith a leather bind good book on the stand\n\nSays 'if you're ready for a change, here's your chance\n\nWith every head bow, slip up your hand'\n\n\n\nIf you wanna feel something real\n\nThat this mean old world can't kill\n\nNot even Satan, there's a saviour\n\nHe'll wash away your sins\n\nAll you gotta do is reap in\n\nOpen up your heart, accept him and\n\nHe'll save your soul\n\n\n\nJesus is a hero, ooh ooh\n\nAnd everybody needs a hero\n\nJesus is a hero, ooh ooh\n\nAnd everybody needs a hero",
