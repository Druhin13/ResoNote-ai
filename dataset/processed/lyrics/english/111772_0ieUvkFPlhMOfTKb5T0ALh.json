  "lyrics": "Jesus is the bread of life, without him you're toast\r\nHallelujah y'all, I've found the holy ghost\r\nTo be almost saved only means that you're lost\r\nSins are expensive and Jesus paid the cost\r\nThese church signs, they light up these roads that I roam\n\nThey're leading me closer, they're calling me home\n\nThe further I get, the further I go\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul\n\n\n\nIf you can't stand the heat, turn the prayer-conditioner up\n\nDrink some holy water from a Dixie cup\n\nIf you're runnin' on empty, threw up on faith\n\nEven ol' Moses was a basket case\n\n\n\nThese church signs, they light up these roads that I roam\n\nThey're leading me closer, they're calling me home\n\nThe further I get, the further I go\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul\n\n\n\nThese church signs, they light up these roads that I roam\n\nThey're leading me closer, they're calling me home\n\nThe further I get, the further I go\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul\n\nThis interstate gospel is saving my soul",
