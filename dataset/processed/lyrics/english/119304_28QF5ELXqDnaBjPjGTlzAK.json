  "lyrics": "I remember your silhouette on Dyes Inlet\r\nAgainst the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass\r\nUnder stars out on a pier; a celestial sphere\r\nWe were weightless as the waves that disappeared\r\nNorthern lights filled our skies\n\nEmpty nights synchronized\n\n\n\nWe shared a clove cigarette on the parapet\n\nAs the TVs glowed from the windows of the model homes\n\nAnd I'd never be that close again to your lips and perfect skin\n\nAs the tide receded into the unknown\n\n\n\nNorthern lights filled our skies\n\nEmpty nights synchronized",
