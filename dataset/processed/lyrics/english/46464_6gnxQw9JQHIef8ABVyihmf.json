  "lyrics": "And for this I'm not fit for the task to craft words with\r\nAdequate passion to match the\r\nSize of grace beyond anything I can grasp\r\nBut it grabs hold of me so I hold on tight and hug it back\r\nSurrounded by grace that surpasses the past\r\nBeyond anything we could hope for or ask\n\nHow can words describe the Word made flesh\n\nThe best way to understand Him is to understand His death\n\nWhat he set to accomplish and fulfill with every step\n\nHe was sent from the father, God's gift to the world\n\nGave His only Son to purchase sons and daughters\n\nTo make us one with the Son and one with the Father\n\nTook upon Himself the condemnation we deserve\n\nResurrected after death and he promised to return\n\nFilled us with the spirit to seal our reelection and protect us until the day that we share in his resurrection\n\nThe size of grace, how great the size\n\nThe gates of heaven are open wide\n\nAnd people of all kind are welcome inside\n\nShould've been denied, but instead God replied\n\nHe said\n\nIn your place, my son has died\n\nHis death gave you life, it's the size of grace\n\nInnocent blood that was shared to erase every trace of sin for a chosen race\n\nIt's the great exchange, it's the power to change\n\nThe Gospel, salvation, for all who believe\n\nAll for His glory,\n\nOvercoming our hatred and sin with His divine love\n\n\n\nThe love of our God\n\nGracious and kind\n\nGod became a man and suffered for mankind\n\nThe punishment for our sin was worn out on Him\n\nSo we could be forgiven and forever live\n\nSaved by grace, the cost was not cheap\n\nWe can't add to it\n\nHis work is complete\n\nThe greatest gift we can ever receive is the Gospel, salvation, for all who believe\n\n\n\nSo we pray for strength with the power of His Holy Spirit\n\nSo that Christ may dwell in our hearts through faith\n\nThat we would have the strength to comprehend together with all the saints\n\nThe height, depth, and length\n\nThe love of Christ that surpasses knowledge\n\nFilled with the fullness of God\n\nThe size of Grace\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Lexis for these lyrics)",
