  "lyrics": "My trust broken in half\r\nHead rush right from the start\r\nOh no, I don't wanna let it show\r\nUndress all of my doubts\r\nNaked with or without no clothes\r\nAnd I don't even feel that cold\n\n\n\nJust the thought of letting go\n\nMakes me wanna pull you closer\n\nClose enough so you can whisper every word\n\nRun your fingers through my hair\n\nDrawing pictures on my shoulder\n\nWaiting for the time for you to say it first\n\n\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\nEvery time we touch is gold\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nNothing can be left unspoken\n\nEvery time we touch is golden\n\n\n\nBed sheets cover the floor\n\nBodies keeping us warm all night\n\nWe don't have no sense of time\n\nYou're like adrenaline rushing through my bloodstream\n\nIs this love? 'Cause I can't seem to get enough\n\n\n\nJust the thought of letting go\n\nMakes me wanna pull you closer\n\nClose enough so you can whisper every word\n\nRun your fingers through my hair\n\nDrawing pictures on my shoulder\n\nWaiting for the time for you to say it first\n\n\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\nEvery time we touch is gold\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nNothing can be left unspoken\n\nEvery time we touch is golden\n\n\n\nDon't wanna leave this room\n\nFeel like the gravity's a magnet to you\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\nEvery time we touch is gold\n\n\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\nEvery time we touch is gold\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\n\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\nEvery time we touch is gold\n\n(Every time we touch is gold)\n\nWant you to lay with me\n\n(Want you to lay, lay with me)\n\nNothing can be left unspoken\n\nEvery time we touch is golden\n\n\n\nDon't wanna leave this room (don't wanna leave)\n\nFeel like the gravity's a magnet to you\n\nWant you to lay with me (lay with me)\n\nI don't know where this is going\n\nEvery time we touch is gold",
