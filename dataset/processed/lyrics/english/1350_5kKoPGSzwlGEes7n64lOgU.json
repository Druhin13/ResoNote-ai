  "lyrics": "Some time ago I was glidin' by\r\nRacing time, reaching out for your love\r\nWhen it hit me it knocked me out\r\nCalmed me down, pushed me up just enough\r\nFor a while I was flying high, chasing the sun\r\nSet it off in the wild\n\nThere you were, you were calling back\n\nPushing me off this cliff and up into the-\n\n\n\nLight\n\nAnd you feel it collide with your night\n\nWhen you see it coming after you don’t hide\n\nCan you feel it collide with your night?\n\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\n\n\nAll the pieces they come undone\n\nBuild em up, break them down into dust\n\nAnd it convinced me to make that drive\n\nTake that fall, open the window enough\n\nAnd for a while I was crying loud\n\nBleeding out, wishing my way through the dark\n\nThere you were, you were calling back\n\nPushing me off this cliff and up into the-\n\n\n\nLight\n\nAnd you feel it collide with your night\n\nWhen you see it coming after you don’t hide\n\nCan you feel it collide with your night?\n\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\n\n\nHold tight 'cause it's coming\n\nWe can’t erase any pain from our pages\n\nOoo, what’s in the way can’t stay\n\nAnd if I can imagine it then so can anybody else\n\nSo can anybody else\n\n\n\nThere it is, it’ll call you back\n\nPushing me off this cliff and up into the-\n\n\n\nLight\n\nAnd you feel it collide with your night\n\nWhen you see it coming after you don’t hide\n\nCan you feel it collide with your night?\n\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?\n\n\n\nYeah, Can you feel it? Can you feel it running wild?\n\nYeah, Can you feel it? Can you feel it running wild?\n\nYeah, Can you feel it? Can you feel it running wild?\n\nCan you feel it? Can you feel it?",
