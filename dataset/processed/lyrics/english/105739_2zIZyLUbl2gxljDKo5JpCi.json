  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Sweetness follows par R.E.M\r\n   \n\nReadying to bury your father and your mother,\nwhat did you think when you lost another ?\nI used to wonder why did you bother,\ndistanced from one, blind to the other ?\n\nListen here my sister and my brother\nwhat would you care if you lost the other ?\nI always wonder why did we bother,\ndistanced from one, deaf to the other.\n\nOh, oh, but sweetness follows\n\nIt's these little things, they can pull you under.\n\nLive your life filled with joy and wonder.\nI always knew this altogether thunder\nwas lost in our little lives.\n\nOh, oh, but sweetness follows.\nOh, oh, but sweetness follows.\n\nIt's these little things, they can pull you under.\nLive your life filled with joy and thunder.\nYeah, yeah we were altogether\nlost in our little lives.\n\nOh. Oh. Ah.\n\nOh, oh, but sweetness follows.\nOh, oh, but sweetness follows.",
