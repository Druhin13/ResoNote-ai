  "lyrics": "Your hair's looks a little longer\r\nYour arms look a little stronger\r\nYour eyes just as I remember\r\nYour smile's just a little softer\r\nAnd I never prepared for a moment like that\n\nYeah, it suddenly came all back, it all came back\n\n\n\n'Cause after all these years\n\nI still feel everything when you are near\n\nAnd it was just a quick hello\n\nAnd you had to go\n\nAnd you probably will never know\n\nYou're still the one i'm after all these years\n\n\n\nCouldn't help, but overhear you\n\nSounds like you're happy with her\n\nBut does she kiss you like I kissed you?\n\nI wish I loved you like I miss you\n\n\n\nAnd I never prepared for a moment like that\n\nYeah, it suddenly came all back, it all came back\n\n\n\n'Cause after all these years\n\nI still feel everything when you are near\n\nAnd it was just a quick hello\n\nAnd you had to go\n\nAnd you probably will never know\n\nYou're still the one I'm after all these years, oh\n\n\n\n'Cause after all these years\n\nI still feel everything when you are near\n\nAnd it was just a quick hello\n\nAnd you had to go\n\nAnd you probably will never know\n\nYou're still the one I'm after all these years\n\n\n\nI never told you\n\nI should've told you\n\nI never told you after all these years\n\n(told you... told you...)\n\nI never told you after all these years",
