  "lyrics": "I'm not the billionaire class\r\nFrom San Lorenzo with the trailer trash\r\nI can't afford a fucking thing in sight\r\nSomething about this state is just so right\r\nSan Francisco, give me your money\r\nDrug-crazed, road-rage, don't ya act funny\n\nI wanna smoke till I'm Oakland high\n\nAnd drop some acid in the Barstow night\n\nSacramento, marching downtown\n\nMendocino, beer me down\n\n\n\nCut me open leave me splayed (stitch me back together)\n\nCalifornia's bleeding me (blame it on the weather)\n\nSail me down the river\n\nTemper like a trigger\n\nTake a shot of vodka, blow out my liver\n\nCalifornia's bleeding me\n\n\n\nDon't give a fuck if I'm banned\n\nThe fucking rodents down at Disneyland\n\nHighway 5 down to 99\n\nI'm getting head near the Fresno sign\n\nBerryessa, stumbling and stammered\n\nEast Bay Tramps out drinking and hammered\n\nAnd Hollywood's giving me the bends\n\n'Cause in LA you ain't got no friends\n\nFremont meth-head getting me wired\n\nStart a riot, light a fire\n\n\n\nCut me open leave me splayed (stitch me back together)\n\nCalifornia's bleeding me (blame it on the weather)\n\nSail me down the river\n\nTemper like a trigger\n\nWatch your back, here come the gold diggers\n\nCalifornia's bleeding me, and I don't care tonight\n\n\n\nWe're going west\n\nLike rats we come to infest\n\nWe never rest\n\nFeed on the fucking stress\n\n\n\nCut me open leave me splayed... stitch me back together\n\nCalifornia's bleeding me (blame it on the weather)\n\nSail me down the river\n\nTemper like a trigger\n\nTake some shots and blow out my liver\n\nCalifornia's bleeding me, and I don't care tonight\n\n\n\nAnd you won't go home\n\n'Cause we welcome all\n\nGolden State brings home the gold",
