  "lyrics": "Drums in my ear \nMy train just caught on fire and I'm stuck here at the station\r\nIs that Shannon playing on my favorite radio?\r\nI can remember the first time that I saw her\r\nI should have known that she would always be around\n\n\n\nAnd what's the problem if I've got a little hesitation?\n\nIt it wrong to be afraid of growing up?\n\nCan we wash these extra hands\n\nI'm losing my sense of direction\n\nIn a haze\n\n\n\nWhen everybody wants to get me high\n\nEverybody wants to get me high\n\nEverybody wants to get me high\n\nBut where will they go when I'm low\n\n\n\nI told myself I'd never lose a bet against me\n\nI told my mom I'd never stay out after dark\n\nFuck it all, I plead the fifth\n\nModern music makes me sick\n\nAnd leaves me hungry for some action\n\n\n\nYour brain just caught on fire\n\nSo you're stuck playing dress up\n\nWould you unsee everything and sedate yourself again?\n\nHere's an axe\n\nFind a tree\n\nWhat an opportunity to start a blaze \n\n\n\nWhen everybody wants to get me high\n\nEverybody wants to get me high\n\nEverybody wants to get me high\n\nBut where will they go when I'm low \n\nBut where will they go when I'm low \n\n\n\nDrums in my ear, just what I need\n\n\n\nWhen everybody wants to\n\nWhen everybody wants to\n\nWhen everybody wants to\n\nWhen everybody wants to get you high\n\nGet you high\n\nGet you high\n\nGet you high",
