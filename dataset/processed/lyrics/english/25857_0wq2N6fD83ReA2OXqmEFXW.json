  "lyrics": "I'm not asking you for much\r\nI'm just asking for some faith in then I'll shut up\r\nI'm broken down and beat up by this world\r\nI'm not saying I need a crutch\r\nI'm just saying there's pieces that I can't pick up\r\nHeavy is the crown that we lean on\n\n\n\nHow long, how long,\n\n'Till we find the pieces we've been missing\n\nHow long, how long, will it take\n\nHow long, how long,\n\n'Till we find the pieces we've been missing\n\nHow long, how long, will it take\n\n\n\nI will always, always love you\n\nI will always, always love you\n\n\n\nI'm not asking for a thing\n\nI'm just asking for the things that we lost\n\nI'm not sure I can do this on my own\n\nAm I holding on too tight\n\nAm I squeezing the life out of everything I love\n\nBattle with what I've got before its gone\n\n\n\nHow long, how long,\n\n'Till we find the pieces we've been missing\n\nHow long, how long, will it take\n\nHow long, how long,\n\n'Till we find the pieces we've been missing\n\nHow long, how long, will it take\n\n\n\nHow long, how long,\n\n'Till we find the pieces we've been missing\n\nHow long, how long, will it take\n\nHow long, how long,\n\n'Till we find the pieces we've been missing\n\nHow long, how long, will it take\n\n\n\nI will always always, I will always always love you\n\nHow long, how long",
