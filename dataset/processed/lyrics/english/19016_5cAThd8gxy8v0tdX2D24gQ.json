  "lyrics": "This is our corner of the planet\r\nIt's the straight edges we inhabit\r\nWe ignore the darkness at the door\r\nTurn the lights out if you hear me\r\nStop your screaming, just speak clearly\r\nThe lonely and the righteous\n\nI just need friends and nothing more\n\n\n\nThis old town still gets out of line\n\nDarkness at the door to greet me\n\nIt's the first sign of an affliction\n\nFamiliarity of an addiction\n\nThat old friend's a welcome sight\n\nI like it when I see him\n\nHe covers up the world we live in\n\nLights a firework in my pocket\n\nSome friends are worth the fight\n\n\n\nThis old town still gets out of line\n\nDarkness at the door to greet me\n\nNever lonely in town\n\nDarkness at the door to greet me\n\nI must manage expectations\n\nMy idols are revelations\n\nI hope I never meet them\n\n\n\nThis is our corner of the planet\n\nIt's the straight edges we inhabit\n\nJust friends and nothing more\n\nBecome the darkness at the door\n\nWaiting for the darkness\n\nWaiting for the darkness",
