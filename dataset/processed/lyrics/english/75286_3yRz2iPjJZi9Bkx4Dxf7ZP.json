  "lyrics": "Day after day I'm more confused\r\nThen I look for the light through the pourin' rain\r\nYou know, that's a game, that I hate to lose\r\nI'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame\r\n[CHORUS:]\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\n\n\nWon't you take me away\n\n\n\nBeginin' to think, that I'm wastin' time\n\nAnd I don't understand the things I do\n\nThe world outside looks so unkind\n\nAnd I'm countin' on you, you can carry me through\n\n\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\n\n\nWon't you take me away\n\n\n\nAnd when my mind is free\n\nYou know your melody can move me\n\nAnd when I'm feelin' blue\n\nThe guitars come through to soothe me\n\n\n\nThanks for the joy you've given me\n\nI want you to know that I believe in your song\n\nAnd rhythm, and rhyme, and harmony\n\nYou helped me along, you're makin' me strong\n\n\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\n\n\nWon't you take me away\n\n\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\nGive me the beat boys and free my soul\n\nI wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away\n\n\n\nWon't you take me away",
