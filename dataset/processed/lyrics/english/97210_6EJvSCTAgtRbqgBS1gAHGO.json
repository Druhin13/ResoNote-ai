  "lyrics": "Now Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along\r\nEveryone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on\r\nHe never was a hero, or this county's shinin' light\r\nBut you could always find him standing up\r\nFor what he thought was right\n\nHe'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything\n\nYou've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string\n\nNever compromise what's right and uphold your family name\n\nYou've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything\n\n\n\nNow we might have been better off or owned a bigger house\n\nIf Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backing down\n\nBut we always had plenty just living his advice\n\nWhatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight\n\n\n\nHe'd say you've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything\n\nYou've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string\n\nNever compromise what's right and uphold your family name\n\nYou've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything\n\n\n\nNow I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's days\n\nBut I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed\n\n\n\nYou've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything\n\nYou've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string\n\nNever compromise what's right and uphold your family name\n\nYou've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything\n\n\n\nYou've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything",
