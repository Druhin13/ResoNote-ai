Oh, my gosh!\r\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nWord up\n\n\n\nI write for Sean Price and Dilla, my mic is Thriller\n\nMy ratchet blows, it's trappin' souls like Bryson Tiller\n\nThey sprayed the crib, left lead in the awnings\n\nAnd that's the very thing that gets me out the bed in the mornin'\n\nI got the bread in the corner, got my career in the sauna\n\nI got no fear of dishonor, I bled and lived through trauma\n\nFirst the Fat Boys break up, then Bow Wow retires\n\nAnd now y'all disrespectin' the King\n\nI come through there with the street sweeper for niggas\n\nClaimin' they doin' dirt and get to just disinfectin' the scene\n\nI'm what you call the epitomizer of gettin' dark, I will spit a geyser\n\nThat'll get these guys on the charts to fit a liger of bars\n\nI'm feelin' like the diamond on the permanent throne\n\nWeed like the Qu'ran, burn it, you can get stoned\n\nIt's smellin' like a megaphone in the coupe\n\nGo in the two with extra zone in the booth, flow in the tool\n\nThe headphones, the microphone and the new poems approve\n\nI'm the best to ever progress on the measured, metronome in the loop\n\nAll I can do is turn your sister to my all-night masseuse\n\nZonin' to Gu', this is my moment of truth\n\n\n\nCan I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nNow, can I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nIf she pretty, I'ma come around your city\n\nI'm gon' hunt it down, hit it, I'ma hit it, I'm gon' come around and rock it\n\nCan I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nNow, can I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nAnytime I come around your city, I'm gon' burn it down\n\nVenue after venue, I'm gon' come around and rock it\n\n\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nWord up\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nWord up\n\n\n\nNow, first the Dipset split up, then Azealia Banks leave twitter\n\nAnd now you niggas hatin' on Nickel\n\nI just been the same standup nigga since the day I came in this game\n\nAnd I just come in here to stay til' I'm crippled\n\nI'm a combination of Kane, G-Rap, Reggie Noble, and James\n\nWho still has Ashanti and Kelly Rowland in dreams\n\nThey tried to blackball me, but couldn't, I was too fuckin' good\n\nThey tried to run me out of my city, I was too fuckin' hood\n\nSo, all I'm tryin' to say (say) to artists tryin' to kill me is\n\n\"Hey! Even Patron had to stand in line and wait\"\n\nThis is God's work handcrafted by karma\n\nI'ma always be here laughin' and clownin', last til' I promise\n\nAnd last but not least, I'ma finally retire my dad\n\nFrom that post office, and that's on my mama\n\nI live my life for my girls and my boys\n\nAnd I took my soul back from the devil, now the world can enjoy it\n\n\n\nCan I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nNow, can I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nIf she pretty, I'ma come around your city\n\nI'm gon' hunt it down, hit it, I'ma hit it, I'm gon' come around and rock it\n\nCan I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nNow, can I rock it? Yes, you can\n\nAnytime I come around your city, I'm gon' burn it down\n\nVenue after venue, I'm gon' come around and rock it\n\n\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nWord up\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nYou know I come around and rock it\n\nWord up",
