  "lyrics": "I plant my seeds in these dirt roads\r\nI see myself in these cornrows\r\nI learn about love, I learn about pain\r\nTalking to God, praying for rain\r\nI found my wings in this Texas wind\r\nIt picks me up to fly and knocks me down again\n\nThere's some things in life you can't explain\n\nSo I'm talking to God, praying for rain\n\n\n\nSo I can stand tall in a storm like a live oak tree\n\nNo one in this world's gonna ever get the best of me\n\nRunning down a dream like I'm chasing a train\n\nFinding who I am a little more every day\n\n'Cause I'm just a girl\n\nTalking to God, praying for rain\n\n\n\nI see the world through my mama's eyes\n\nBut I got my grandpa's stubborn pride\n\nAnd I hope that I never change\n\nSo I'm talking to God, praying for rain\n\n\n\nSo I can stand tall in a storm like a live oak tree\n\nNo one in this world's gonna ever get the best of me\n\nRunning down a dream like I'm chasing a train\n\nFinding who I am a little more every day\n\n'Cause I'm just a girl\n\nTalking to God, praying for rain\n\n'Cause I'm just a girl\n\nTalking to God, praying for rain",
