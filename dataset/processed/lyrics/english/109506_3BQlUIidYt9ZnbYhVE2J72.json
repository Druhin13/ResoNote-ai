  "lyrics": "Don't you dare go running down\r\nMy little town where I grew up\r\nAnd I won't cuss your city lights\r\nIf you ain't ever took a ride around\r\nAnd cruised right through the heart of my town\n\nAnything you say would be a lie\n\n\n\nWe may live our lives a little slow\n\nBut that don't mean I wouldn't be proud to show ya\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's an old plow boy out turning up dirt\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt\n\nWhere I come from\n\nWhen a couple boys fight in the parking lot\n\nNo, nobody's gonna call the cops\n\nWhere I come from\n\n\n\nSee that door right there, man I swear\n\nIt ain't never been locked\n\nAnd I can guarantee that it never will\n\nThat old man right there in the rocking chair\n\nAt the courthouse square I'll tell you now\n\nHe could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills\n\n\n\nDon't let those faded overalls fool ya\n\nHe made his millons without one day schoolin\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's a pickup truck with the tailgate down\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThe pine trees are singing a song of the south\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThat little white church is gonna have a crowd yeah\n\nI'm pretty damn proud\n\nWhere I come from.\n\n\n\nguitar solo\n\n\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's a big old moon shining down at night\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's a man done wrong gonna make it right\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's an old plow boy out turning up dirt\n\nWhere I come from\n\nThere's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt\n\nWhere I come from\n\nWhere a couple of boys fight in the parking lot no\n\nAin't nobody's gonna call the cops\n\n\n\nYeah, that river runs across that Oakland rock\n\n\n\nWhere I come from (x2)",
