  "lyrics": "Just beyond my windowpane, I saw you\r\nWalking in the rain away from me\r\nVisions of your future lay before you\r\nYou are free\r\nI saw you in the company of strangers\n\nLaughing just a little bit too loud\n\nLooking at reflections in a mirror\n\nI can see the smiling faces\n\nBut not me among the crowd\n\nWondering how\n\n\n\nI wish that I could play this like a love song\n\nSo I could shape it like I wanted to\n\nI'd make it purely from the heart\n\nI know that surely from the heart\n\nThere only comes the gentlest of tunes\n\nBut where are you?\n\n\n\nWe tried to set the world on fire\n\nAnd almost did with our desire\n\nTwo of us and maybe more\n\nKids inside a candy store\n\nSparks of joy and celebration\n\nSuddenly we're drowned beneath the tears\n\nAnd baby, you're the reason that\n\nI haven't played this song in years\n\nYes baby, you're the reason that\n\nI haven't played this song in years\n\n\n\nSome believe in magic potions\n\nHeads all full of crazy notions\n\nCastles built upon a sandy shore\n\nOnly magic I believe in\n\nIs the magic I receive from\n\nLoving you and needing nothing more\n\nNothing more\n\n\n\nWe never heard each other's cries\n\nThat's how lovers turn to lies\n\nWhen I gave, you wanted more\n\nThen suddenly we're keeping score\n\nI forgave your small deceptions\n\nTill I couldn't hide my deepest fears\n\nAnd baby, you're the reason that\n\nI haven't played this song in years\n\nyes baby, you're the reason that\n\nI haven' t played this song in years",
