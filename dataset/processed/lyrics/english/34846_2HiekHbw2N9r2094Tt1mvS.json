  "lyrics": "Big cities, tall buildings, concrete\r\nObsolete moods, and the scent of smoke\r\nTwo worlds and none in which I fit\r\nAll covered in dirt\r\n\n\nBlock letters in your formations\n\nI see shades of you everywhere I turn\n\nThin line from here to here\n\nBetween being sane or disturbed\n\n\n\nWe go on with our lives\n\nOur separate ways\n\nAnd as I pass my time\n\nThe memory stays\n\n\n\n\n\nCold sweats, but nights won’t wait\n\nWe run fast, the light won’t catch us\n\nThis life is different, for better or worse\n\nBut it’s all an act\n\n\n\nLike the songs that I’ll play you someday\n\nLike a frozen frame, stuck in my head\n\nNo outrunning the ghosts of your past\n\nI learn to live with them\n\n\n\nWe go on with our lives\n\nOur separate ways\n\nAnd as I pass my time\n\nThe memory stays\n\n\n\nWe go on with our lives\n\nOur separate ways\n\nAnd as I pass my time\n\nThe memory stays\n\n\n\nThe memory stays\n\nThe memory stays\n\nThe memory stays\n\nSeparate ways",
