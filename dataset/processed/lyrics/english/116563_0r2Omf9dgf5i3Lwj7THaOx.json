  "lyrics": "Polaroid of u dancing in my room\r\nI want to remember I think it was about noon \nIt's getting harder to understand, to understand \nHow u felt in my hands (in my hands)\r\nI could be a pretty girl \nI'll wear a skirt for u\n\nI could be a pretty girl \n\nShut up when u want me too \n\n\n\nI could be a pretty girl, won't ever make u blue, \n\nI could be a pretty girl, I'll lose myself in you, \n\nI was so blinded by you, \n\nNow I cry just thinkin bout the fool that I was, \n\nI was such a fool! \n\nI'm alone now but it's better for me, \n\nI don't need all your negativity, \n\n\n\nI could be a pretty girl \n\nI'll wear a skirt for u \n\nI could be a pretty girl \n\nShut up when u want me too, \n\nI could be a pretty girl \n\nWon't ever make u blue, \n\nI could be a pretty girl \n\nI'll lose myself in u",
