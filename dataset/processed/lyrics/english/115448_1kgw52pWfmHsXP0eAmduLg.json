  "lyrics": "Like a '90s dream, cool cut, left drop earring\r\nCigarette stuck to the bottom of your lip\r\nSaw you standing on the corner of the street\r\nYou got your own style with the way that you’re moving\r\nI know your type, I spent too many nights\r\nBlack mascara dripping from my eyes\n\nSo I tell myself \"girl don't get, girl, don't get too close\"\n\nCause\n\n\n\nYou\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\nYou\n\nSo easy, you don’t even try\n\nYou spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that\n\nYou're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad\n\nYou\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\n\n\nI get turned on, I get strung out on the idea\n\nFrom the chaos of the bad romantic feels\n\nGuys like you know what to say to get me naked\n\nGive me temporary pleasure\n\nThere's something you do better\n\n\n\nYou\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\nYou\n\nSo easy, you don't even try\n\nYou spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that\n\nYou're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad\n\nYou\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\n\n\nI know your type, I spent too many nights\n\nBlack mascara dripping from my eyes\n\nSo I tell myself \"girl don't get, girl, don’t get too close\"\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\n(All the pretty girls cry)\n\nYou\n\nSo easy you don’t even try\n\nYou spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that\n\nYou’re standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad\n\n\n\nYou\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\nYou\n\nSo easy, you don't even try\n\nYou spoil us, toy with us when you're looking like that\n\nYou're standing there heavenly, always leaving us sad\n\nYou\n\nYou make all the pretty girls cry\n\n\n\nYou, you make all the pretty girls cry",
