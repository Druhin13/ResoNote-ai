  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson My C. C. Blues par Major Murphy\r\nLead me to water\nCan I quench my thirst?\nWhen I take hold to one thing\nI find out what it’s worth\n\nStanding in the moonlight time and time again\nTethered to a satellite, lonely at the end\nTechnicolored images dance before my eyes\nDoing the impossible but I’m not satisfied\n\nI’m scrolling through the information gauging my desire\nThere’s elemental wisdom deep within a burning fire\nBalancing facticity while channeling my muse\nI’m singing about my conceptual, circumstantial blues\n\n\nWaiting in the dead of night until the light of dawn\nUnlock the chamber so I might be let in\nWhen I take hold to one thing I find that it resists\nWandering the neighborhood while I should be in bed\nObserving in the silence there so I might understand\nI’m sailing on the ocean now searching for dry land\nSeeking out some solid ground for my feet to stand\nI want to refresh the content, eager to consume\nIt’s all a part of my conceptual, circumstantial blues\n\n\nEven in the dead of the night I’ll try to start again\nTurn back the pages, scan the fine print\nMaybe it’s like David said, maybe that was it",
