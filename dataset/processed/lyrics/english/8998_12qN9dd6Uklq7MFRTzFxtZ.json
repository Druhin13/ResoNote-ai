  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson WYWH par Goody Grace\r\nYou know my bones, I know your scars\nI know you don't like to go far\nAnd you know I can't stay in one place for too long\nAnother plane, another sea\nI'm so lost, it's plain to see\nAlways wondering where you could be\n\nThese Paris lights keep spelling your name\nReminding me I wish you were here\nAnd I'm terrified of yelling your name\nCause now-a-days it's all that I hear\nI saw the Eiffel Tower from the window of the plane\nAt the 19th hour of a late August evening\nAnd I thought to myself where could you now be\n\n\nCause you know my bones, I know your scars\nI know you don't like to go far\nAnd you know I can't stay in one place for too long\nAnother plane, another sea\nI'm so lost, it's plain to see\nAlways wondering where you could be\n\nThese London lights keep spelling your name\nReminding me I wish you were here\nI come alive when I hear your name\nAnd now-a-days it's all that I hear\nI wanna lose my mind with you\nHear you say you want me too\nBut darling I know that isn't true\nOh, am I who you'll come to in the end\nOh am I, am I who you'll come to in the end\n\n\nCause you know my bones, I know your scars\nI know you don't like to go far\nAnd you know I can't stay in one place for too long\nAnother plane, another sea\nI'm so lost, it's plain to see\nAlways wondering where you could be",
