(bet my heart on)\n\n\n\nIs it real, is it fake?\n\nWould you leave, would you stay?\n\nWill the night turn into day?\n\nWill we get close or will it be over?\n\nI'm only hoping\n\nI don't waste, I don't waste\n\n\n\nAll of my love, All of my love\n\nMy time, my attention\n\nMy patience, I'm giving it all\n\nAll the above, all the above\n\nNo this ain't the way\n\nThat I usually play this\n\nNo, no\n\n\n\nWould I lose\n\nIf I bet my heart on you?\n\nWould I lose\n\nIf I bet my heart on you?\n\nI don't wanna slow down\n\nWon't you let me know now\n\nWould I lose, oh\n\nIf I bet my heart on you?
