  "lyrics": "Damage has defined our border\r\nAll that matter forged in flame\r\nKnowing little of your wounding\r\nShare our mending all the same\r\nWeight of words and wars we carried\n\nI'm like you, just like you\n\nEyes of stone and storm and story\n\nBut shared, and well, we'll make it through\n\n\n\nSadness like a pendulum\n\nPulls us round and to and fro\n\nOnus Fate and Undo Odium\n\nWall and anchor, armor, stone\n\n\n\nBy the telling let them become\n\nLet them all be feathers\n\n\n\nEyes of stone and [stone?] and story\n\nTell them well, we'll make it through\n\nOnus Fate and Undo Odium\n\nWall and anger, armor, stone\n\n\n\nBy the telling may they become\n\nMay they all be feathers",
