  "lyrics": "She lights me up and hails me in\r\nBlows me out like a cigarette\r\nHis fingertips tracing my skin\r\nLike a wildflower and I can't handle it\r\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming back for more\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming, keep coming back\n\nI keep coming back for more\n\n\n\nPlaying with fire\n\nAnd the flame's getting higher\n\nI'm going up in smoke\n\nYou got someone else but I don't care\n\nI want you and you belong right here\n\nYeah there's someone else\n\nBut she's not you, no\n\nShe don't love me like you do\n\n\n\nSo I keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming back for more\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming, keep coming back\n\nI keep coming back for more\n\n\n\nPlaying with fire\n\nAnd the flame's getting higher\n\nI'm going up in smoke\n\nI'm going up in smoke\n\nGoing up in smoke\n\nUp in smoke\n\n\n\nJust when I think I'm out\n\nYou pull me right back in\n\nBeen here before and here we go again\n\n\n\nFire\n\nFire\n\n\n\nPlaying with fire\n\nAnd the flame's getting higher\n\nI'm going up in smoke\n\nI'm going up in, I'm going up in\n\nI'm going up in smoke\n\n\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI keep coming, coming back\n\nI'm coming back, coming back\n\n...\n\nI keep coming back for more\n\n\n\nJust when I think I'm out\n\nYou pull me right back in",
