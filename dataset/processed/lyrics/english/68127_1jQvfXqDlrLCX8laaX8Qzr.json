  "lyrics": "You play your cards face down, darling, every time\r\nMaking me figure out what's inside your mind\r\nI never know, I never know\r\nI never know what you're thinking\r\nDo my best but I can't solve your mystery\n\nLike a test you don't leave a single clue for me\n\nWhy won't you show, why won't you show\n\nWhy won't you show me anything else\n\n\n\nIt's getting hard for me\n\nHere in the dark, honey\n\nI think I'm giving up this time\n\n\n\nCause I can't read your mind\n\nI've tried\n\nDon't make me play your game of twenty questions tonight\n\nI'll admit it, tell me what you gotta say\n\nYour pretty but baby I don't want to play\n\nYour guessing game\n\nYour guessing game\n\nAsking me to read\n\nWhat's between your lines\n\nWhy can't we just pretend I know the answer this time\n\nI'll admit it, tell what you gotta say\n\nYou're pretty, but baby I don't want to play\n\nYour guessing game\n\nYour guessing game\n\n\n\nIs it fun watching me trying to work it out\n\nYou're the one with the key, what's it all about\n\nWhy can't you see, why can't you see\n\nWhy can't you see I'm trying baby\n\n\n\nIt's getting hard for me\n\nHere in the dark, honey\n\nI think I'm giving up this time\n\n\n\nCause I can't read your mind\n\nI've tried\n\nDon't make me play your game of twenty questions tonight\n\nI'll admit it, tell me what you gotta say\n\nYour pretty but baby I don't want to play\n\nYour guessing game\n\nYour guessing game\n\nAsking me to read\n\nWhat's between your lines\n\nWhy can't we just pretend I know the answer this time\n\nI'll admit it, tell what you gotta say\n\nYou're pretty, but baby I don't want to play\n\nYour guessing game\n\nYour guessing game\n\n\n\nNow that we're face to face\n\nWhy don't you turn me straight\n\nWe could just skip this part\n\nIt's not too late\n\nIt's not too late\n\nI'm sorry, just tell me what I gotta do\n\nI'm tired trying to get through to you\n\nI wish I knew\n\nI wish I knew\n\nI'll admit it, just tell me what you gotta say\n\nYou're pretty, but baby I don't want to play\n\n\n\nI can't read your mind\n\nI've tried\n\nDon't make me play your game of twenty questions tonight\n\nI'll admit it, tell me what you gotta say\n\nYour pretty but baby I don't want to play\n\nYour guessing game\n\nYour guessing game\n\nAsking me to read\n\nWhat's between your lines\n\nWhy can't we just pretend I know the answer this time\n\nI'll admit it, tell what you gotta say\n\nYou're pretty, but baby I don't want to play\n\nYour guessing game\n\nYour guessing game",
