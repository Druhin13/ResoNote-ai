  "lyrics": "A country dance was being held in a garden\nI felt a bump and heard an \"Oh, beg your pardon\"\nSuddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams\nAll around a pug-nosed dream\n\nThe music started and was I the perplexed one\n\nI held my breath and said \"May I have the next one?\"\n\nIn my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams\n\nSparkled on a pug-nosed dream\n\n\n\nThere were questions in the eyes of other dancers\n\nAs we floated over the floor\n\nThere were questions but my heart knew all the answers\n\nAnd perhaps a few things more\n\n\n\nNow in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter\n\nI know the meaning of the words \"Ever after\"\n\nAnd I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams\n\nWhen I kiss the pug-nosed dream",
