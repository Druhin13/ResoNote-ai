  "lyrics": "Featuring Juicy J\r\nVirgin Mary I'm stoned, Mick Jagger\r\nI can run around Saturn\r\nEyes rolling back and keep blinking like hazards\r\nI say king me, king me\n\nWith my mushroom crown on\n\nI graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on\n\nDon't knock me off my high horse\n\nWhat I do is my choice\n\nI'm high as the scoreboard\n\nBitch look up at my points\n\nI'm trippin out, cotton mouth\n\nI got high and fell asleep loaded\n\nI woke up and got high again",
