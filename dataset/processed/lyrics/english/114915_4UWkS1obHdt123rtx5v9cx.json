  "lyrics": "Why don't you tell me what she's got on me?\r\nI find it hard to believe that anyone, will love you as great as me\r\nI miss how your passion wake me out of my sleep\r\nBanging on my door at a quarter to three\r\nYou play it safe so I guess you go with her\r\nBut our society's outlook on me bet you choose me first\n\nNo I'm not the type of girl you bring to mom\n\nBut we've got a special bond\n\nYou ain't the type of guy I bring to my dad\n\nBut there's nowhere else I'd rather be\n\nThan with you, yeah, than with you\n\n\n\nYou run the streets, you gettin' cash\n\nYou livin' life, you spend it fast\n\nI say you run the streets, you gettin' cash\n\nYou livin' life and you spend it fast\n\nJust like me, just like me\n\nHey, why can't we just be back together? Oh yeah\n\n\n\nTats on my face and you say you're ashamed\n\nBut deep down I know you love it, you love\n\nThe spark that I bring, the way that I sing, you love it (Oh)\n\nI wear all black and you do the same\n\nYou do your drugs and I have my ways\n\nI am a reflection of you\n\nSo, stop playin' safe, so you go with her\n\nWell guess you'll be bored for the rest of eternity\n\nI know you love me and you know you do\n\nSo, that's when you call and tell me it's true\n\n\n\nYou run the streets, you gettin' cash\n\nYou livin' life, you spend it fast\n\nI say you run the streets, you gettin' cash\n\nYou livin' life and you spend it fast\n\nJust like me, just like me\n\nHow you hate me for being like you baby? Ooh woah\n\nBut when we make love things just be",
