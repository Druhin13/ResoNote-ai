Get you 15 knots, quick\nThat's a lump sum, sweaty bitches Trump dumb\n15 shots to that head, I get 'em punch drunk\n15 milli stalking that IG\nSo why in the fuck would I need a ID?\nHoes looking thirsty, get on my IV\nVoice of the new generation, you can't deny me\n\nTape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready\n15, Black Mamba, shit gon' be so deadly\n(Tape dropping September, I hope you hoes ready\nBust 15 tons, this shit is so heavy)\n\n15, 15, rose up from the depths, now I live a dream\n15, 15, making history, this shit something they never seen",
