Love me like you say you do\n\nWhen you need to, love me like you say you do\n\nLove me like you say you do\n\n\n\nNow you got me feeling bad, I'm slipping far away from you\n\nAnd you're doing all the things I said that you should do\n\nBut it only lasts so long like the setting sun\n\nSo under these blue skies, I'll tell you one more time\n\n\n\nIf you love me, love me like you say you do\n\nWhen you need to, do what you say you do\n\nIf you love me, love me like you say you do\n\nWhen you need to, love me like you say you do\n\n\n\nLove me like you say you do\n\nYou gotta love me like you say you do\n\nSay you do, say you do\n\nHolla, holla, tell you what I want, yeah\n\nGotta, gotta love me like you should, yeah\n\nHolla, holla, tell you what I need, yeah\n\nGotta love me like you say you do\n\n\n\nIf you love me, love me like you say you do\n\nWhen you need to, do what you say you do\n\nIf you love me, love me like you say you do\n\nWhen you need to, love me like you say you do\n\n\n\nDo you love me? Love me like you say you do\n\nWhen you need to, love me like you say you do",
