  "lyrics": "Perhaps I am bound to be restless\r\nAlways yearning, never satisfied\r\nPerhaps I'm aching for nothing\r\nThat words can't ever define\r\nWas I happy in those moments\n\nOr have I made it seem that way?\n\nWas I back there tomorrow\n\nCould feel as lacking as today?\n\n\n\nBut you when your golden hour\n\nAnd you with your sweetest song\n\nAnd you with your tender offerings\n\nHow could I ever do you wrong?\n\n\n\nThere's an unrest that keeps me marching\n\nThere's foolish hope that can be found\n\nSomething so true and lasting\n\nCould it let me on the ground?\n\nStill I like my world boundless\n\nIt never ceases to entice\n\nIt's the hunger in my bones\n\nIt's the new day in my eyes\n\n\n\nAnd you in your darkened hour\n\nAnd me and my broken soul\n\nHere you come with the tender offerings\n\nHow could I ever do you wrong?\n\n\n\nAnd me in my doubting hour\n\nAnd you with your soothing song\n\nAnd you when you call my mercy\n\nAnd you when you can't be strong\n\nHere you come with your tender offerings\n\nHow could I ever do you wrong?\n\nHow could I ever do you wrong?\n\nHow could I ever do you wrong?",
