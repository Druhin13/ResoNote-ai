  "lyrics": "She's praying to a god who won't talk back\r\nHer faith is dying, tears are a sign she's going off track\r\nKeep praying to a god who won't talk back, won't talk back\r\nDown on her knees and praying to a god who won't talk back\r\nHer momma believed that the devil had a dress on\n\nSo she's out on the town tonight, she got her best on\n\nHer daddy believed that the needle was a highway\n\nSo she powders her nose, she's just looking for direction\n\n\n\nIt gets hard to feel the friction underwater\n\nAs she's breaking down, she's tearing at the borders\n\nIn too deep to save herself, she takes a pill that seems to help\n\nClose her eyes and pictures standing at the altar\n\n\n\nShe's praying to a god who won't talk back\n\nHer faith is dying, tears are a sign she's going off track\n\nShe's praying to a god who won't talk back, won't talk back\n\nDown on her knees and praying to a god who won't talk back\n\n\n\nIt gets hard to feel the friction underwater\n\nAs she's breaking down, she's tearing at the borders\n\nIn too deep to save herself, she takes a pill that seems to help\n\nClose her eyes and pictures standing at the alta",
