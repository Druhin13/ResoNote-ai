  "lyrics": "Do you know, I fell in love with you\r\nI can't remember, how long has it been\r\nAll I know, Is this love within my heart\r\nWaiting for you\r\nCan't you see, what you mean to me\r\nHow I wish you could read my mind\n\nAll these feelings, I could never find the right words to explain\n\nLike the snow, oh my love\n\nFalling down from above\n\nIn Time (In time)\n\nIt piles high, As if to touch the sky\n\n\n\nHold me tight, I wish I'd never known your light\n\nThis can't be right\n\nThis can't be how it's meant to feel\n\nBut I can't turn back time\n\nNow, cause I love you\n\nI only wish it wasn't true\n\nI wish I could forget, wish that we'd never met\n\nIt's like my heart, I know eternal snow\n\n\n\nDo you know, you're still in my dreams\n\nHow much longer till' you let me sleep\n\nSo I stay awake at the window pane\n\nMy breath fogging the glass\n\nCan the snow in my heart\n\nMelt away with the pain\n\nOne day (One day) I pray that it might\n\nJust take my hands, and pray\n\n\n\nHold me tight, until I brake\n\nI hope I might,\n\nCause then the wind and cold can't reach me anymore\n\nI only wanna feel nothing\n\nI miss you\n\nWhen every thought's a thought of you\n\nAnd I stand here alone, cause tonight is the same\n\nIt's like my heart, I know eternal snow\n\n\n\nI wonder if the falling snow\n\nWill numb my heart\n\nAnd if with time, it could hide\n\nThese lonely nights, and all my love for you\n\n\n\nHold me tight, I wish I'd never known your light\n\nThis can't be right\n\nThis can't be how it's meant to feel\n\nBut I can't turn back time\n\nNow, cause I love you\n\nI only wish that it wasn't true\n\nYou can't be here and I, shall endure winter sky\n\nInside my heart, I know eternal snow\n\n\n\nHold me tight, Oh I miss you\n\nI love you\n\nAnd I stand here alone\n\nCause tonight is the same\n\nSo for forever, Oh Eternal snow",
