  "lyrics": "It's hard to believe\r\nThis is the same road we started on\r\nAshes to beauty once again\r\nWhen we couldn't see\r\nAnd it all disappeared from under us\n\nHe became the ground beneath our feet\n\n\n\nEvery step, every struggle\n\nEvery triumph, every trial\n\n\n\nLook at the mountains we've climbed\n\nLook at how faithful He's been\n\nTo deliver us\n\nLook at how far we've come\n\nThe story of unfailing love\n\nJesus has made a way\n\nTo deliver us\n\nLook at how far we've come\n\n\n\nHe takes our wreckage\n\nPuts all the pieces back together\n\nBreathing new life into the dust\n\n\n\nEvery step, every struggle\n\nEvery triumph, every trial\n\n\n\nLook at the mountains we've climbed\n\nLook at how faithful He's been\n\nTo deliver us\n\nLook at how far we've come\n\nThe story of unfailing love\n\nJesus has made a way\n\nTo deliver us\n\nLook at how far we've come\n\n\n\nYou never let go, you never let go\n\nGod, through it all You will never let go\n\nYou never let go, you never let go\n\nGod, through it all You will never let go\n\nYou never let go, you never let go\n\nGod, through it all You will never let go\n\nYou never let go, you never let go\n\n\n\nLook at the mountains we've climbed\n\nO God how faithful You've been\n\nTo deliver us, deliver us\n\nLook at the mountains we've climbed\n\nO God how faithful You've been\n\nTo deliver us\n\nLook at how far we've come\n\nThe story of unfailing love\n\nJesus You made the way\n\nTo deliver us\n\nLook at how far we've come",
