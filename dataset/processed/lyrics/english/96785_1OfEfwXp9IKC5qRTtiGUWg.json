  "lyrics": "Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge\r\nIce creates the water that's no longer runnin' under it\r\nStool holds the fool that pours the whiskey on his broken heart\r\nCigarettes create the smoke that hides the lonesome in his eyes\r\nThe jukebox plays Hank, \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\"\r\nDance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are\n\nThat's what happens in every little honky tonk bar\n\n\n\nFriday night, it's a given\n\nWe'll be L-I-V-N, livin'\n\nWe'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car\n\nMonday morning, it's a given\n\nWe'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'\n\nAnd that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar\n\n\n\nNeon lights flashin' bright 'til you're almost hypnotized\n\nRed dress, short skirt, gets it on 'bout every night\n\nComin' and goin', always rollin' with the flow\n\nBartender pourin' drinks, CÃ³digo double shots\n\nYou think you're tall and bulletproof until somebody says you're not\n\nStep outside thinkin' you're gonna show 'em you are\n\nThat's what happens in every little honky tonk bar\n\n\n\nFriday night, it's a given\n\nWe'll be L-I-V-N, livin'\n\nWe'll dance on the bar 'til we're sleeping it off in the car\n\nMonday morning, it's a given\n\nI'll be D-R-A-G-N, draggin'\n\nAnd that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar\n\nYeah that's what happens in every little honky tonk bar\n\n\n\nWhiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge",
