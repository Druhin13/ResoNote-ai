  "lyrics": "You pulled me under the wave\r\nThrowing me up every day\r\nUnderwater I'm, losing strength to fight\r\nWhat are you saying to me\r\nYou come and go as you please\r\nBlue eyes, you're dead\n\nLooking through my head\n\n\n\nYou speak like a bullet\n\nThat flies right into me\n\n\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\nWe always kick back\n\nMy heart's on my sleeve\n\nSo aim at the knees\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\nWe always kick back\n\nSo fire when you please\n\nJust shoot and release\n\n\n\nWhiplash\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\n\n\nYou better watch what you say\n\nPulling me every way\n\nMake a fool of me\n\nEvery time you speak\n\nRunning away through night\n\nForever be paralyzed, lies\n\nDropping to my knees\n\nPush me back to sea\n\n\n\nYou speak like a bullet\n\nThat flies right into me\n\n\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\nWe always kick back\n\nMy heart's on my sleeve\n\nSo aim at the knees\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\nWe always kick back\n\nSo fire when you please\n\nJust shoot and release\n\n\n\nWhiplash\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\nI feel the whiplash\n\nI feel the whiplash",
