  "lyrics": "He doesn't fight crime or wear a cape\r\nHe doesn't read minds or levitate\r\nBut every time my world needs saving, he's my superman\r\nSome folks don't believe in heroes 'cause they haven't met my dad\r\nHe loves his workshop and rock and roll\n\nHe's got a hot rod and a heart of gold\n\nAnd you could say he's a man of few words, but he talks a lot within\n\nAnd even though I'm a little taller, I still look up to him\n\n\n\nHe built me a house in the arms of a tree\n\nHe taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream\n\nWhen he looks in my eyes I hope he can see\n\nThat my dad's a hero to me\n\n\n\nRust-ridden fenders, and doors full of dings\n\nSomehow he can fix about anything\n\nI didn't think he knew how to cry till our dog died that year\n\nHe doesn't always say I love you, but I can hear him loud and clear\n\n\n\nHe built me a house in the arms of a tree\n\nHe taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream\n\nWhen he looks in my eyes I hope he can see\n\nThat my dad's a hero to me\n\n\n\nHe built me a house in the arms of a tree\n\nHe taught me to drive, and to fight, and to dream\n\nWhen he looks in my eyes I hope he can see\n\nThat my dad's a hero to me\n\n\n\nMy dad's a hero to me\n\nMy dad's a hero to me",
