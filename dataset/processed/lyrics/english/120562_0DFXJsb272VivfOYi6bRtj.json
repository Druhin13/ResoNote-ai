  "lyrics": "Cruising down the river. Dancing ’til your feet got numb. Cool, summer breezes blowing through your hair, as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park. Ah, memories of Boblo Island\r\nOh, is your world ain’t nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut. Just jealous of everybody that’s headed out on that Boblo boat. It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks. Oh, man. I wish I was joining you. A little cheese and crackers. A little get out wine. A little rear medium lights. Some Harvey Rizla green. But let’s do this. Only on Smooth FM\r\nNothing compared to our family trips\r\nMy uncle shook hands with a manly grip\n\nAll this hand-me-down s--t I had had an uncanny fit\n\nAll the gangstas I had in my family had me anti-b---h\n\nMy granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist\n\nThat was back ‘fore I was born\n\nPop told stories ’bout it that would last for hours-long\n\nAnd as a family we was just so happy when him and mama got along\n\nOn the Boblo boat\n\nUh, on our way to that black amusement park\n\nWood roller coasters, crack sold on plastic scooter cards\n\nUh, smoking grass at the vintage food court\n\nBroken glass, waiting on you on the swimming pool floor\n\nI came across my identity on the Boblo boat\n\nThat’s where I lost my virginity, no condom, though\n\nThat’s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does\n\nLeft my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was\n\nParties on the way to the island would be the livest, though\n\nFirst time big bro hit the bottle was on the Boblo boat\n\nBut neither one of us knew that we would both grow up and turn to alcoholics, though\n\nThe Boblo boat\n\n\n\nHey, hey, hey. Lil’ green. Come here. Hey, hit this, n---a. N---a, don’t worry ’bout what the f--k it is. Just drink\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nSome of my better times I said were true\n\nI said were true, yeah\n\nS--t, all of my better days I said were true\n\nI said were true, s--t\n\nAnd now I gotta wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, s--t\n\nStuck inside a rat race, f--k, rat race, f--k, f--k\n\nWake up, wake up, wake up, wake up again\n\nStuck inside this rat race, f--k\n\nYeah, look\n\n\n\nTwist the cap, lift the bottle back, swig it\n\nD--k it, ten-inch rims on my mama’s Civic\n\nTen-inch woofers in the trunk, to be specific\n\nThey bump, rattle the license plate, plus the windows tinted\n\nDon’t even give a f--k that it’s dented, b---h, I’m the man now\n\nI’m rolling, driving it slow as if it’s stolen\n\nPiling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser\n\nCalling up hoes like we was Jodeci, let’s check her\n\nDouble D’s like double-deckers, I wanna sex her\n\nBut these keys don’t come with game on how to finesse her\n\nFive semesters left until college, I’m under pressure\n\nI’m not a real n---a ’til I undress her, I gotta ‘press her\n\nThis was my main concern back when concerns were lesser\n\nNowadays, I often yearn to press the backspace button\n\nOr hit return, but life is not no word processor\n\nMost folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of my real-life trauma\n\nPlus fickle n----s thinking they done heard the best of Jermaine Lamarr\n\nBut that’s insane, it couldn’t be further left of\n\nThe truth is that my new s--t slap, you never heard it better\n\nGive me a sec, I murder sectors\n\nPrefer to let you see it rather than say it, but it spill out\n\nI gotta chill out\n\nSay “F--k the world” and never pull out\n\nWe had no Boblo boat, but I could note those times is like a Bible quote\n\nBC, before cellphones, the first time I would smoke\n\nI was 6-years-old, but that’s for another chapter\n\nThat’s for another story, to God be the glory\n\nI made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe with my son and Tanzanian sunrays thinking ’bout dumb days\n\nThinking ’bout dumb days\n\n\n\nThis is 808-Ray",
