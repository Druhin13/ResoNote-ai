  "lyrics": "When I said it out loud, it wasn't as strong as it was in my head\r\nI tried not to think about it, so it came back louder\r\nI think it's been about a year since I became a snob\r\nDecided not to play along, so it grew bigger\r\nMe and my head have become very, very, very close\n\nWe decided not to tell you, to tell you about it\n\nWe're just gonna play it safe\n\nDo what we know\n\nPlay it cool, lay low\n\nNot tell you about it\n\nAnd here I am playing by myself\n\nMe and my superiority complex\n\nAnd here I am playing by myself\n\nMe and my inferiority contest\n\nI'm not winning, but I'm having a very good time\n\n\n\nYou can call me, you can call me\n\nYou can call me, the good time girl\n\n\n\nWhen I said it out loud, it didn't sound as good\n\nI couldn't be as proud of my original thought\n\nI'm not tryna whisper what should be barked\n\nBut I can't imagine being out of control\n\nOr knocked off the top\n\nMy head and I, when I'm all alone\n\nBut I'm in my prime\n\nDon't want the throne\n\nWhen I'm doing just fine\n\nJust so long as I'm having a real good time\n\n\n\nMe and my head have become very, very, very close\n\nWe decided not to tell you, to tell you about it\n\nWe're just gonna play it safe\n\nDo what we know\n\nPlay it cool, lay low\n\nNot tell you about it\n\nAnd here I am playing by myself\n\nMe and my superiority complex\n\nAnd here I am playing by myself\n\nMe and my inferiority contest\n\nI'm not winning, but I'm having a very good time\n\n\n\nYou can call me, you can call me\n\nYou can call me, the good time girl",
