  "lyrics": "Feeling good feelin great\r\nHow are y’all doin\r\nIt’s no debates no hot takes or arguing\r\nIt’s both a science and an art to it\r\nGiving you my deepest thoughts\r\nWhile y’all feel like you ballrooming\n\nBack when my nigga Fatin was bumpin Cross Movement\n\nAnd my brother Eccentric was still a law student\n\nI used to jump in the whip throw on a beat and write bars to it\n\nAnd get sharp to it all summer long\n\nLike I’m doin martial arts to it\n\nIt was my mental training\n\nIt’s insane pursuing a dream\n\nAnd then all love is lost to ya\n\nNow I think about my pops wishin I could have a talk to him\n\nOr walk to him\n\nAnyone you miss you’d say the same\n\nNow on to lighter thangs\n\nLet’s start moving\n\nComing back to this spot was a long shot\n\nBut nigga what’s a long shot to a sharp shooter\n\n\n\nSomething that's on my mind it's something I gotta find and I\n\nGot to find that love again\n\nSaid it's something that's on my mind it's something I gotta find and I\n\nGot to find that love again\n\n\n\nMy mans told me I was in a rare set\n\nOf those who made it to the other side\n\nTruth be told I don’t really know if I’m there yet\n\nThe higher I go all I’m seeing is stair steps\n\nA never ending cycle if you ain’t aware yet\n\nI’m like slow your roll\n\nMy capacity’s at an overload\n\nI know my lane I know the ledge I know the role\n\nThat other bullshit’s kinda low on the totem pole\n\nA fine life it ain’t like we stressin\n\nEyes planted on my own paper like we testin\n\nLike we guessed it\n\nIf not us, on who do we depend?\n\nI started questioning everything I’m believing in\n\nNow that it’s over feel like I can finally breathe again\n\nI hope this record finds you if you ever need a friend\n\nSeven years ago these stories I wouldn't dare tell\n\nThat's all for now farewell until we meet again",
