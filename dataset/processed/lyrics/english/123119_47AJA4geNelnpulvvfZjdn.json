  "lyrics": "I tried to be the hero for a day\r\nBut all my superpowers failed to save\r\nSo I turned in my ego and my cape\r\nI was made to fly but not this way\r\nIt all starts with breathing You in\n\nBreathing You in deeply\n\nI've been drowning under my skin\n\nNo one but You can save me\n\n\n\nMy weakness is my honor not my shame\n\nLeaning is my portion not my pain\n\nI was frantic till You changed the pace\n\nYou won't give me more than I can take\n\n\n\nIt all starts with breathing You in\n\nBreathing You in deeply\n\nI've been drowning under my skin\n\nNo one but You can save me\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're my hero\n\nYou're the only One\n\nWho is strong enough\n\nYou're my hero\n\nYou always pick me up\n\nBefore I self-destruct\n\nYou're my hero\n\nYou're the only One\n\nWho is strong enough\n\nYou're my hero\n\nYou always pick me up\n\nBefore I self-destruct\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all starts with breathing You in\n\nBreathing You in deeply\n\nI've been drowning under my skin\n\nNo one but You can save me",
