(What now)\n\nThe whispers and the screams\n\nThe stereotypical profiling ritual\n\nVicious and obscene\n\n\n\nSo now you pack your bags\n\nThe party’s such a drag\n\nAnd everyone can tell that you’re poisoning the well\n\nBut there are no mistakes\n\nExcept what you create\n\nYou need to know your place\n\n\n\n'Cause it’s about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nIt’s about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nYeah, I’m bangin’ slingin’ napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nSo nobody move\n\n'Cause I was sent to warn you\n\nThe devil's in the next room\n\n\n\n'Cause it’s about to get heavy (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nIt’s about to be on (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nYeah, I’m bangin’ slingin’ napalm (Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nSo nobody move\n\n'Cause I was sent to warn you\n\nThe devil's in the next room\n\n\n\n(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nYeah the devil's in the next room\n\n(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nYeah the devil's in the next room\n\n(Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy)\n\nSo nobody move\n\n'Cause I was sent to warn you\n\nThe devil's right beside you",
