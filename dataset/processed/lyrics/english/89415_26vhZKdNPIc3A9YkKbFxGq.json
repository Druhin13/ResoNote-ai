  "lyrics": "You can't put out a wildfire with a whisper\r\nYou can't calm a hurricane with a kiss\r\nYou can't catch lightning, you can't hush thunder\r\nYou can't hold back a stubborn storm like this\r\nBut she can\n\nIf she can love a guy like me\n\nThat girl can do about anything\n\n'Cause Lord knows I've got brakes to fix\n\nBut that ain't backed her down an inch\n\nShe my lost heart's saving grace\n\nShe's my eyed closed leap of faith\n\nNot just anyone can love me just the way I am\n\nBut she can\n\n\n\nShe can cool me off quicker than a rainfall\n\nShe can read my mind like an open book\n\nShe sees every part of me\n\nBrightens up the darkest me\n\nIf anyone can heal me with a look\n\nShe can\n\n\n\nIf she can love a guy like me\n\nThat girl can do about anything\n\n'Cause Lord knows I've got brakes to fix\n\nBut that ain't backed her down an inch\n\nShe my lost heart's saving grace\n\nShe's my eyed closed leap of faith\n\nNot just anyone can love me just the way I am\n\nBut she can\n\nOh, she can\n\n\n\nShe can make me wanna be better\n\nShe's been doin' it since the day I met her, yeah\n\n\n\nIf she can love a guy like me\n\nThat girl can do about anything\n\n'Cause Lord knows I've got brakes to fix\n\nAnd that ain't backed her down an inch\n\nShe my lost heart's saving grace\n\nShe's my eyed closed leap of faith\n\nNot just anyone can love me just the way I am\n\nBut she can\n\n\n\nBut she can\n\nOh, she can\n\n(She sees every part of me)\n\n(Brightens up the darkest me)\n\nShe can",
