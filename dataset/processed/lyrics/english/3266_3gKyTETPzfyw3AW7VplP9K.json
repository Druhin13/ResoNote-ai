  "lyrics": "IÃ¿wonder if we'll smile in our coffins while loved ones\r\nMourn the day, the absence of our faces, living, laughing,\r\nEyes awake. Is this too much for them to take?\r\nToo young for ones conclusion, the lifestyle won.\r\nSuch values you taught your son. That's how.\n\nLook at me now. I'm broken.\n\nInherit my life.\n\n\n\nOne day we all will die, a cliched fact of life. Force fed\n\nTo make us heed. Inbred to sponge our bleed. Every\n\nWarning, a leaking rubber, a poison apple for mingled\n\nBlood. Too young for ones delusion the lifestyle cost\n\nVenereal Mother embrace the los$. That's how\n\n\n\nLook at you now. You're broken\n\nInherit your life.",
