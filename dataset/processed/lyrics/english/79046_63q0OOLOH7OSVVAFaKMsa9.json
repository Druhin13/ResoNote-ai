  "lyrics": "I ain´t much on Casanova, me and Romeo ain´t never been friends.\rCan´t you see how much I really love you ?\rGonna sing it to you time and time again. Oh, Casanova, Casanova.\rEvery man deserves a good woman, and I want you to be my wife.\rTime is so much better spent with you, baby, a woman just like you in my life.\rSo let me love you, fill you up inside, I want to hold you, baby,\rSo let me squeeze you, don´t you know that I´ll get down on my knees for you, baby ?\rYou see: I ain´t much on Casanova, me and Romeo ain´t never been friends.\rCan´t you see how much I really love you ?\rGonna sing it to you time and time again. Oh, Casanova, Casanova.\rEvery time I want to se you, I can´t find the words to tell you so.\rI love, I love, I love, I love, I love you, baby,\rAnd I just got to let you know how much I need you,\rShow you what you mean to me each day, baby.\rSo let me hold you, keeping you safe and warm, I´ll be your sweetheart, baby.\rAnd when I told you: Girl, I´m an average guy,\rYou seem to know just how I really feel.\r´Cause I can´t let you go, I need and want you to stay right here with me.\rBaby, I never knew love until you came along.\rOh, Casanova, tell me what you say, Casanova, I can´t let you get away.\rOh, Casanova, tell me what you do, Casanova, I just wanna be with you.\rListen baby: I wanna hold you, I wanna squeeze you, too,\rI wanna make swet love to you, I wanna be there when you feeling low,\rNever let you go, no, Casanova.",
