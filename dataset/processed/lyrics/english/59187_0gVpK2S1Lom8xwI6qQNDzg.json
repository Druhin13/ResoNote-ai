  "lyrics": "Well I'm sick of hanging out on the street\r\nEvery Saturday night with the boys\r\nListening to the radio's big beat\r\nWe crank it just to hear the noise\r\nYeah we talk about the girls, girls, girls\n\nAnd we talk, talk, talk all night\n\nSure we're all Romeos and Casanovas\n\nBut we can't seem to get it right\n\n\n\nSeems I'm making it harder and harder\n\nWhile everybody else is doing well\n\nI get confused by their bodies\n\nI get tangled in their curls\n\nHow do you talk to girls\n\nHow do you talk to girls\n\nWhat's a poor boy to do\n\nTell me how do you talk to girls?\n\nHow do you talk to girls?\n\n\n\nI see this girl over there right away\n\nI'm trying to think of something to say\n\nWell I think I'll have one more drink\n\nI'll be ready to make my play\n\nBut this guy moves in and he talks to her\n\nAnd she nods her head\n\nWell I'm used to missing out on the girl\n\nBut I want to know what he said\n\n\n\nSeems I'm making it harder and harder\n\nWhile everybody else is doing well\n\nI get confused by their bodies\n\nI get tangled in their curls\n\nHow do you talk to girls?\n\nHow do you talk to girls?\n\nWhat's a poor boy to do\n\nI'm tangled up in their curls\n\n\n\nHow do you talk to girls?\n\nHow do you talk to girls?\n\nOut of wisdom and out of pearls\n\nTell me how do you talk to girls\n\n\n\nAm I stupid or misunderstood\n\nI'd say something clever if I only could\n\nWe're only ten feet apart\n\nBut it feels like the world",
