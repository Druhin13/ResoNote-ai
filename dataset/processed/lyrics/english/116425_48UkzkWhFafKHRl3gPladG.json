  "lyrics": "I can feel the energy\r\nThat changes in my chemistry\r\nThe atmosphere, the way I breathe\r\nMy automatic action is\r\nTo close my eyes and wander in\r\nAnd wait until the madness ends\n\nLost communication with the world outside\n\nI fall into my own, into the abyss\n\n\n\nLost inside my head, I open up the door\n\nStep right off the ledge, into the abyss\n\nNothing that I know, I can't hear what you say\n\nAm I already dead, into the abyss\n\n\n\nLooking through distorted eyes\n\nA mirror that I can't recognize\n\nNo way out, no exit signs\n\nI try to make myself believe\n\nI'm only in a lucid dream\n\nIt's like another world exists\n\nI wanna go back into the abyss\n\n\n\nLost inside my head, I open up the door\n\nStep right off the ledge, into the abyss\n\nNothing that I know, I can't hear what you say\n\nAm I already dead, into the abyss\n\n\n\nLost communication with the world outside\n\nSo much devistation in my world I hide\n\nI fall into my own, into the abyss\n\n\n\nLost inside my head, cracks across the floor\n\nStep right off the ledge\n\n\n\nInto the abyss\n\nNothing that I know, I can't hear what you say\n\nAm I already dead, into the abyss",
