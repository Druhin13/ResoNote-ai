  "lyrics": "We used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time\r\nTalkin' 'bout high hopes and day dreams\r\nNever thought love, never thought life\r\nCould take us far beyond what we believed\r\nAs long as I got your love next to me\r\nI'm better than I used to be\n\n\n\nI been chasin' this dream\n\nI'm so glad you understand\n\nClimbing up a mountain, would it leave you hardly standing\n\nThings don't go just the way you planned it\n\nBut I never thought we'd have, so much to take for granted\n\n\n\nYou never know what you got till it's gone\n\nGuess I never know cause I know you're my only one\n\n\n\nWe used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time\n\nTalkin' 'bout high hopes and day dreams\n\nNever thought love, never thought life\n\nCould take us far beyond what we believed\n\nAs long as I got your love next to me\n\nI'm better than I used to be\n\nBetter than I used to be\n\n\n\nIt's been a long day alone\n\nAnd I can hardly stand it\n\nMy plane leaves tomorrow\n\nBut my heart has already landed\n\nThings didn't go, just the way I planned it\n\nBut I never thought we'd have, so much to take for granted\n\n\n\nYou never know what you got till it's gone\n\nGuess I never know cause I know you're my only one\n\n\n\nWe used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time\n\nTalkin' 'bout high hopes and day dreams\n\nNever thought love, never thought life\n\nCould take us far beyond what we believed\n\nAs long as I got your love next to me\n\nI'm better than I used to be\n\nBetter than I used to be\n\nBetter than I used to be\n\nBetter than I used to be\n\n\n\nWe used to be kids in the backseat wastin' time\n\nTalkin' 'bout high hopes and day dreams\n\nNever thought love, never thought life\n\nCould take us far beyond what we believed\n\nAs long as I got your love next to me\n\nI'm better than I used to be",
