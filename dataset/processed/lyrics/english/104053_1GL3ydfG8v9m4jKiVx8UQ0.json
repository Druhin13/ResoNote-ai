  "lyrics": "There are times to remember\r\nAnd times that I wish to forget\r\nOur time together was tinged with love and regret\r\nOh, my girl\r\nMy sweet, sweet little girl\n\nDidn't I try to tell ya that life was for living?\n\nOh, didn't I?\n\nAnd wasn't I the guy who said 'stay away from that tribe'?\n\nOh, wasn't I?\n\nAnd didn't I try to tell you 'that's stuffs gonna kill ya'?\n\nOh, didn't I?\n\nBut you thought it was cool and I was just an old fool\n\nOh, look at ya\n\n\n\nYou left home for the city with Hollywood stars in your eyes\n\nNow your mother, God bless her, cries herself to sleep every night\n\nOh my girl, my sweet innocent girl\n\n\n\nDidn't I search the streets for the beggars, pimps and cheats?\n\nOh, didn't I?\n\nAnd didn't I try to guide you to a baptism of fire?\n\nOh, didn't I?\n\nAnd didn't I try to warn ya 'bout that folk in California?\n\nOh, didn't I?\n\nBut you said 'daddy, please don't worry, I got friends out there who love me'\n\nNow look at ya\n\n\n\nOh baby, come back home, we can work this out\n\nThere is no blame\n\nI wanna hold you close and stroke your hair and share your pain\n\n\n\nDidn't I do the best for you, try to make you stay in school?\n\nDidn't I?\n\nOnce I was your hero but I went from ten to zero\n\nOh, didn't I? Now listen\n\nFor a roll on the dice you nearly paid the ultimate price\n\nOh, didn't ya?\n\nNow I stand by your bedside, watching you fight for you life\n\n\n\nWhere's the innocence? (Where's the innocence? )\n\nWhere's the future? (Where is the future?)\n\nWhere the beauty? (Ooo)\n\nWhere's the promise? (Where is the promise?)\n\n\n\nThere are times to remember\n\nAnd times that I wish to forget",
