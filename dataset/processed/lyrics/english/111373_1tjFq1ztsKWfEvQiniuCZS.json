  "lyrics": "These fields don't grow overnight, this town wasn't built in a day\r\nI'll be turnin' that dirt when the sun comes up\r\nGoin' round in circles while that plane you're on takes you away\r\nChasin' down that sun in L.A, 2000 miles it ain't that far\r\nGirl, wherever you are\n\nI'll wait for you, I'll wait for you\n\nFind your way back, I'll pray you do\n\nI'll wait for you\n\n\n\nThe August rain, the break of dawn\n\nLike anything worth countin' on\n\nComin' through, I'll wait for you\n\n\n\nI'll keep the light on on the porch, I'll keep the key under the mat\n\nJust in case I'm out there somewhere tryin' not to lose my mind\n\nWhen you come back I know you gotta go\n\nAnd if you don't girl you'll never know\n\nAnd if you can't find what you want out there\n\nI'll be right here, ain't goin' nowhere\n\n\n\nI'll wait for you, I'll wait for you\n\nFind your way back, I'll pray you do\n\nI'll wait for you\n\n\n\nThe August rain, the break of dawn\n\nLike anything worth countin' on\n\nComin' through, I'll wait for you\n\nOh I'll wait for you\n\n\n\nThese fields don't grow overnight\n\nThis town wasn't built in a day\n\nSome things you love are worth the wait\n\nWorth the wait\n\n\n\nI'll wait for you, I'll wait for you\n\nFind your way back, I'll pray you do\n\nI'll wait for you\n\n\n\nThe August rain, the break of dawn\n\nLike anything worth countin' on\n\nComin' through, I'll wait for you\n\n\n\nOh I'll wait for you\n\nI'll wait for you\n\nOh I'll wait for you\n\nI'll wait for you",
