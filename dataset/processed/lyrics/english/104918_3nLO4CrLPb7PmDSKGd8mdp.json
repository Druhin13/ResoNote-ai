  "lyrics": "Here I am again\r\nTrading in a group of friends\r\nTo hopefully make amends\r\nWith everything I've done wrong\r\nA last ditch effort\r\nTo find something better\n\nAnd leave well enough alone\n\n\n\nI will wait for all the words of happiness\n\nI will wait for all the words of jubilation\n\nI will hope for just an ounce of confidence\n\nTo offer myself some sort of congratulations\n\n\n\nThere is a light I'm trying to find\n\nBetween the water and the open sky\n\nI know that's where the wild winds blow\n\nThrough times of trouble\n\nOr just a simple stumble\n\nI can go and make some real good noise\n\n\n\nStill I wait for all the words of happiness\n\nStill I wait for all the words of jubilation\n\nI will hope for just an ounce of confidence\n\nTo offer myself some sort of congratulations\n\n\n\nI wanna live where the wild winds blow\n\nI know\n\nI wanna live where the wild winds blow\n\nI know",
