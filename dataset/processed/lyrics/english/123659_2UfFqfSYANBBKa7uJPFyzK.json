Your top 10? You can say whoever better than\n\nI'm ready now, I was ready then, I was headed down the aisle\n\nRap game in a wedding gown, she gave me the ring\n\nI said, \"Yes\" and vowed for forever now\n\nOn the honeymoon, getting naked now\n\nOn a money pile, doing doggystyle\n\nI'm a father now, and you are my child\n\nOr you aren't my child, I'm on \"Maury\" now\n\nAnd I'm talking loud, the results are found\n\nYou are not the - wow, I should kill this bitch like a doggy pound\n\nWe divorcing now\n\nI want the cars, ring, clothes, all the houses\n\nYou broke my heart, I'm re-organizing\n\nReally trying to be mature about it\n\nBut I got a killer like a fucking dealer\n\nDream-villain, spill-villain rhyme to the ceiling\n\nWould I should I kill a rapper 'cause I coulda\n\nDuh nigga, this a gun and a bullet\n\n\n\nI heard niggas looking for a problem\n\nBut we don't even move till' the rent due\n\nMy niggas hands itching, finna rob something\n\nBetter pray to God that he don't get you\n\nBetter pray to God that he don't get you\n\nBetter pray to God that he don't get you\n\nBetter pray to God that he don't get you\n\n\n\nNot that I need it\n\nThis nigga cap as fuck man\n\nAin't not cap in my rap\n\n[?]\n\nWhere y'all niggas from for real?\n\n[?]\n\nOhhh",
