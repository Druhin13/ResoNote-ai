  "lyrics": "Many nights we've prayed\r\nWith no proof anyone could hear\r\nIn our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood\r\nNow we are not afraid\r\nAlthough we know there’s much to fear\r\nWe were moving mountains long before we knew we could\n\n\n\nThere can be miracles when you believe\n\nThough hope is frail, it's hard to kill\n\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve\n\nWhen you believe, somehow you will\n\nYou will when you believe\n\n\n\nIn this time of fear when prayer so often proves in vain\n\nHope seems like the summer bird, too swiftly flown away\n\nYet now I'm standing here, my heart so full, I can’t explain\n\nNow I'm standing here\n\nSeeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say\n\n\n\nThere can be miracles when you believe\n\nThough hope is frail, it's hard to kill\n\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve\n\nWhen you believe, somehow you will\n\nYou will when you believe\n\n\n\nThey don't always happen when you ask\n\nAnd it's easy to give in to your fears\n\nBut when you're blinded by your pain\n\nCan't see your way here through the rain\n\nWe’re small, but still, we’re singing far\n\nSays help is very near\n\n\n\nThere can be miracles when you believe\n\nThough hope is frail, it's hard to kill\n\nWho knows what miracles you can achieve\n\nWhen you believe, somehow you will\n\nNow you will\n\nYou will when you believe\n\n\n\nYou will when you believe",
