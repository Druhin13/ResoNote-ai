  "lyrics": "I'm holding onto every word that you last said to me\r\nHear your emotion and how everything to you was uneasy\r\nAll these hours between us, they mean nothing, I'll be back to you one day\r\nAnd all these miles between us, they mean nothing, oh I promise we're okay\n\n2 AM calls, oh it's my nature\n\nI'm a little bit high calling to tell you\n\nI'm yours, I'm yours\n\nRemember that night out in my car\n\nWhen I told you there wouldn't be no scars\n\nStill yours, still yours\n\n\n\nNo matter who I'm with, it's you that I adore\n\nIf you're not sure, baby I'm yours\n\nGiven the way you make me feel, I want you more\n\nIf you're not sure, baby I'm yours\n\n\n\nI'm hoping that you'll hear me when I say I need you around\n\nCause life's so busy babe, you keep me up, I'm never coming down\n\n\n\nAnd all these towns between us, they mean nothing, I'll be back to you one day\n\nAnd all these roads between us, they mean nothing, oh I promise we're okay\n\n\n\nI know it's how you're feeling\n\nI'm here, I'm never leaving\n\nI'm yours",
