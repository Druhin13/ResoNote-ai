  "lyrics": "A person who thinks all the time\r\nHas nothing to think about except thoughts\r\nBy thoughts I mean specifically\r\nChatter in the scalp\r\nPerpetual and compulsive repetition of words\r\nHe loses touch with reality and lives in a world of illusions\n\nOf reckoning and calculating\n\nI'm not saying that thinking is bad\n\nLike everything else, it's useful in moderation\n\nWe're so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses\n\nTime to wake up",
