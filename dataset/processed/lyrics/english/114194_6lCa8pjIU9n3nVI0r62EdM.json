way around\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nSpin the block, spin it one more time (all the way, all the way)\n\nGot the drop on you, sittin' outside (skrt, skrt)\n\nMe and Durkio go back to back (back to back)\n\nHangin' out the window, Mac to Mac (brr)\n\nSpin the block, nigga, spin it one more time\n\nUnload that Glock, nigga, load that one more time\n\nFuck them cops, nigga, spin it one more time\n\nHit the spot then I'm hittin' it one more time\n\n\n\nI'm a southside Englewood nigga with a check\n\nHow the fuck you into it with us and you ain't kill nobody yet?\n\nYou was holdin' up diplomas, they was holdin' a Patek\n\nWhile my migos drink Corona, we was pourin' up the Tech\n\nSo don't ever front your move, 'cause Booka catch you through the back\n\nAin't no rumors for no school, paperwork, spittin' facts\n\nAnd they goin' off my word, only time they give it back\n\nAnd my brother lost that trial time, he tryna give it back (gang)\n\nWe be rollin' in the lobby, we be mixin' it with flats\n\nThat's why they don't play with me 'cause I'm not friendly with the threats\n\nOnly The Family in my eyes, I got it tatted on my neck\n\nI just took a flight to Detroit, got some head playin' Dex\n\nWhile my baby mamas trippin' thinkin' they made my life a wreck\n\nAnd they all thought I was tripping 'cause I said his ass a wreck (hoe)\n\nWhy they steady ask for cash, and they know their ass in debt (let's get it)\n\nIn that city we doing 9, that shit first flight to the feds, they wanna kill us (kill us)\n\nFoenem geekin' off them dots, they wanna drill up (drill up)\n\nI know some niggas payin' rent, doin' fill ups\n\nBefore they talk to me, these niggas rather talk to pillows\n\nWe talkin' to these trenches, niggas act like they don't hear\n\nI throw my set up with that draco 'cause we bang\n\nThese niggas mad, they turned to opps 'cause they can't hang (facts)\n\nThey tried to drag my name through mud 'cause they ain't gang (facts)\n\nThey say they family but they don't understand my pain (facts)\n\nTold them old-heads, sit back, just don't get involved\n\nAnd that dope they got ain't sellin', they brought fentanyl (fentanyl)\n\n23 and 1, no visits, I ain't get a call (ain't get a call)\n\nFoenem put them beams on you, look like chicken pox (chicken pox)\n\nAnd that gun I got, that shit don't even come in stocks (brrah)\n\nAnd that nigga I call my plug, his shit don't come in rocks\n\nAnd I heard my ex-bitch out here bad, I heard she full of cocks\n\nAnd you'd think he fuck with Craig, the way he flippin' cars (brr)\n\n\n\nOoh, ridin' 'round with your draco (ridin' 'round with a draco)\n\nOoh, ridin' 'round with your mask on (I'm ridin' 'round with my mask on)\n\nOoh, ridin' 'round with your Glock out (I'm ridin' 'round with that Glock out)\n\nOoh, shout-out niggas who gon' rock out (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nOoh, I ride around with that draco (ridin' 'round with that draco)\n\nOoh, I ride around with my mask on (with my mask on)\n\nOoh, I ride around my check up ('round that my check up)\n\nOoh, I ride around with my mask on (let's get it)\n\n\n\nSpin the block, spin it one more time (all the way, all the way)\n\nGot the drop on you, sittin' outside (skrt, skrt)\n\nMe and Durkio go back to back (back to back)\n\nHangin' out the window, Mac to Mac (brr)\n\nSpin the block, nigga, spin it one more time\n\nUnload that Glock, nigga, load that one more time\n\nFuck them cops, nigga, spin it one more time\n\nHit the spot then I'm hittin' it one more time\n\n\n\nI'm a hot nigga, sound like Juvenile\n\nHit the pot, nigga, hold the other side\n\nOff that block, where the shit get pop-popped\n\nBullet brr, sprinkle, sprinkle, bodies drop, drop (brr, brr)\n\nEvery hour, there's a homicide\n\nFuck them cowards, they can't come outside\n\nSoon as you up the tool, oh, ain't 'bout to let it fly\n\nNiggas get out of line, gotta let it die\n\nSpin the block and spin it one more time\n\nHit the top, hit it one more time (let's go)\n\nSpin the block, spin it one more time\n\nDrop the top, it's a Aston Martin\n\nAsk my Zoe, he gon' ride or die\n\nKick a door, we go eye for eye\n\nSplit the goal, blood on your mind\n\nAventador, I can touch the sky\n\nOut of dungeons, like no dragon [?]\n\nBaby gangster, get it how you live\n\nRondoNumbaNine, get you out of here\n\nI just turned the Gucci socks to a ski-mask\n\nI stopped drankin' for a month, then I relapsed\n\nGot my hood sewed up and I don't be there (I got dawgs)\n\nBought some chains for my niggas, what they be 'bout\n\nGive a bitch 10 Gs when she leave out\n\nCatch the bullet from the stick, cut your sleeves out\n\nGoing straight for the hit, then you ease out\n\nDo a U-turn, hit 'em up, then speed out\n\nAin't no lead, just somethin' to read 'bout\n\n\n\nSpin the block, spin it one more time\n\nHit your block, say it's man down\n\nHit his top, hit him one more time\n\nSpin the block, hit it one more time\n\n\n\nAll the way, all the way",
