  "lyrics": "Four squeezed in on a bench seat\r\nFive holding on in the bed\r\nSlip Joe's older brother a 20, that was plenty\r\nFor a case of beer and a pack of reds\r\nAnd we were set\n\nWe wore our jerseys on Fridays\n\nFelt like kings of the world\n\nClass ring hanging on a silver chain\n\nFrom the neck of your girl\n\n\n\nHey, back when young and dumb was beautiful\n\nWe knew that we knew it all, no one to prove us wrong\n\nThose were the days, couldn't wait to lose our innocence\n\nBragging 'bout it to our friends, Monday after prom\n\nThought we'd always be together, didn't know any better\n\nBack when we thought we'd be 18 forever\n\n18 forever\n\n\n\nBack when freedom was a set of car keys\n\nAnd we were half a tank from anywhere\n\nYeah, I'm still wearing that memory on me\n\nWe got tattoos on a dare, 'cause we didn't care\n\n\n\nHey, back when young and dumb was beautiful\n\nWe knew that we knew it all, no one to prove us wrong\n\nThose were the days, couldn't wait to lose our innocence\n\nBragging 'bout it to our friends, Monday after prom\n\nThought we'd always be together, didn't know any better\n\nBack when we thought we'd be 18 forever\n\n18 forever\n\n\n\nWell it's crazy how those fast times\n\nOnes you thought would always last times\n\nKinda wish you had 'em back times\n\n\n\nHey, back when young and dumb was beautiful\n\nWe knew that we knew it all, no one to prove us wrong\n\nThose were the days, couldn't wait to lose our innocence\n\nBragging 'bout it to our friends, Monday after prom\n\nThought we'd always be together, didn't know any better\n\nBack when we thought we'd be 18 forever\n\n18 forever\n\n18 forever, yeah",
