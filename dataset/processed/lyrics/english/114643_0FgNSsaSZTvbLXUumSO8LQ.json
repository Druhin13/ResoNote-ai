  "lyrics": "I just wanted to be one of The Strokes\r\nNow look at the mess you made me make\r\nHitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase\r\nMiles away from any half-useful imaginary highway\r\nI'm a big name in deep space\r\nAsk your mates but golden boy's in bad shape\n\nI found out the hard way that here ain't no place for dolls like you and me\n\nEverybody's on a bridge floating down the endless stream of great TV\n\n1984 2019\n\n\n\nMaybe I was a little too wild in the 70s\n\nRocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles\n\nKarate bandana\n\nWarp speed chic\n\nHair down to there\n\nImpressive moustache\n\nLove came in a bottle with a twist off cap\n\nLet's all have a swig and do a hot lap\n\n\n\nSo who you gonna call?\n\nThe martini police baby that isn't how they look tonight\n\nIt took the light forever to get to your eyes\n\n\n\nI just wanted to be one of those ghosts you thought that you could forget and then I haunt you via the rear view mirror on a long drive from the back seat\n\nBut it's alright because you love me and you recognise that it's ain't how it should be\n\nYour eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly so pull over\n\nI know the place don't know an apparition is a cheap date\n\nWhat exactly is it you've been drinking these days?\n\nJukebox in the corner\n\nLong hot summer\n\nThey've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance\n\nWhat do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?\n\n\n\nMaybe I was a little too wild in the 70s\n\nBack down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer\n\nElevator down to my make believe residency from the honeymoon suite\n\nTwo shows a day four nights a week\n\nEasy money\n\n\n\nSo who you gonna call?\n\nThe martini police baby that isn't how they look tonight\n\nIt took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes\n\nAnd as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?\n\nIt's the star treatment",
