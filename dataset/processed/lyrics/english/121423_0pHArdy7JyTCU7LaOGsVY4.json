  "lyrics": "There's a Cadillac out in the dark\r\nThere's a guitar gangster lighting a smoke\r\nAnd he feels the night, and he feels the fire\r\nDriving into the city unknown\r\n10 small houses is what he face in the cold\n\nAnd he feels the night, can you feel the fire\n\n\n\nGuitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood\n\nThey came from the road and out of the dark\n\nWent into a place even darker\n\nGuitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood\n\n\n\nWalking into a place called The Bar\n\nPeople looking like a ghost has arrived\n\nAnd he feels the eyes, can you see the eyes\n\n\n\nDear ladies/gentlemen, don't be afraid\n\nWe are here to ease your pain\n\nLet it all start with a song\n\nThen I'm sure we'll get along\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Tichga for these lyrics)",
