  "lyrics": "Holding on to the fortress\r\nBunkered down in between the walls\r\nLooking up, looking up\r\nFires in the sky but the sun's not shining\r\nI hear the sound in the distance\r\nFeel the quake as my castle falls\n\nIt' not enought, not enought\n\nI'm praying to a lie now theres nowhere to hide\n\n\n\nThis house wasn't built for love\n\nNo I could tell you'd hit me over and over\n\nWith waves frow your agitated mind\n\nI'll still tall while you rip me up\n\nI know that it won't bring you closure\n\nCome closure and see what you made of me\n\n\n\nI'll still tall while you rip me up\n\nI know that it won't bring you closure\n\nCome closure and see what you made of me\n\n\n\nBuried deep in a mindset\n\nReaching out with your open arms\n\nI fell in love, fell in love\n\nYou were showing me the light but you left me blinded\n\nI was a lone marionette\n\nJust a toy under your control\n\nWhen you were done, you were done\n\nYou threw me to the side and you left me behind\n\n\n\nThis house wasn't built for love\n\nNo I could tell you'd hit me over and over\n\nWith waves frow your agitated mind\n\nI'll still tall while you rip me up\n\nIknow that it won't bring you closure\n\nCome closure and see what you made of me\n\nWon't bring you\n\nClosure now\n\n\n\nI'll still tall while you rip me up\n\nI know that it won't bring you closure\n\nCome closure and see what you made of me",
