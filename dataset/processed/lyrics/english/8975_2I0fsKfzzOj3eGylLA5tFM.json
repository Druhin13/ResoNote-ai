I had my mind made up like a story\r\nThat you knew the ending of\r\nI always knew that you were pretending\n\nYeah, I always knew that you were pretending\n\n\n\nJust hold on me and I'll wipe away the marks they drawn on you\n\nHere it's you and me cause I...\n\n\n\nI'm holding on by the tips of my fingers. I'm not afraid of the fall\n\nThe only thought that the silence the triggers is the time I went wrong\n\nOh, I know I made a fool of us all\n\nOh, I'm sorry, so sorry. I'm not sorry at all\n\n\n\nIt's always running, always running\n\nIt's easy to find the answer\n\nIt's always been there\n\nIt's always been there\n\n\n\nOh how the tables turn.
