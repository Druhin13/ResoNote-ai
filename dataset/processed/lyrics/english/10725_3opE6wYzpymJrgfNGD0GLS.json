  "lyrics": "I'm sitting in this dark room waiting for my life to develop\r\nI'm holding onto thoughts in my mind that I'm too afraid to tell you\r\nI wish I didn't try so hard to be perfect all the time but my dad hates failure\r\nBut sometimes I need to walk to the edge and let it\r\nJust let it take over\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nFall into the open\n\nScream until they hear it\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\nI just wanna let out all of my anger\n\nGive myself goosebumps\n\nPut myself in danger\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\n\n\nI fantasize about fading into the darkness\n\nBut I put on a smile every day regardless\n\nAnd everyone expects so much from me\n\nAnd I wonder \"What have I started?\"\n\nSometimes I need to walk to the edge and just let it\n\n\n\nJust let it take over\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nFall into the open\n\nScream until they hear it\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\nI just wanna let out all of my anger\n\nGive myself goosebumps\n\nPut myself in danger\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\n\n\nI've lost myself in laughter\n\nI've had tears fall to the ground\n\nI've lived inside disaster\n\nBut the one thing that I've found\n\nIs I, I live so close to the edge\n\nIs I, I live so close\n\n\n\nLet it take over\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nFall into the open\n\nScream until they hear it\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nI let myself feel it\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge\n\nI just wanna let out all of my anger\n\nGive myself goosebumps\n\nPut myself in danger\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nLet myself feel it\n\nI just need to get so close to the edge",
