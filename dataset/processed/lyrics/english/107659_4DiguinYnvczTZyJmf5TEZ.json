  "lyrics": "There's a long black train comin' down the line,\r\nFeeding off the souls that are lost and cryin'.\r\nRails of sin, only evil remains.\r\nWatch out, brother, for that long black train.\r\nLook to the heaven's, you can look to the sky.\r\nYou can find redemption staring back into your eyes.\n\nThere is protection and there's peace the same:\n\nBurnin' your ticket for that long black train.\n\n\n\n'Cause there's victory in the Lord, I say.\n\nVictory in the Lord.\n\nCling to the Father and his Holy name,\n\nAnd don't go ridin' on that long black train.\n\n\n\nThere's an engineer on that long black train,\n\nMakin' you wonder if the ride is worth the pain.\n\nHe's just a-waitin' on your heart to say:\n\n\"Let me ride on that long black train.\"\n\n\n\nBut you know there's victory in the Lord, I say.\n\nVictory in the Lord.\n\nCling to the Father and his Holy name,\n\nAnd don't go ridin' on that long black train.\n\n\n\nWell, I can hear the whistle from a mile away.\n\nIt sounds so good but I must stay away.\n\nThat train is a beauty makin' everybody stare,\n\nBut its only destination is the middle of nowhere.\n\n\n\nBut you know there's victory in the Lord, I say.\n\nVictory in the Lord.\n\nCling to the Father and his Holy name,\n\nAnd don't go ridin' on that long black train.\n\n\n\nI said cling to the Father and his Holy name,\n\nAnd don't go ridin' on that long black train.\n\n\n\nYeah, watch out brother for that long black train.\n\nThat devil's drivin' that long black train.",
