  "lyrics": "We're thought to be like them\r\nThought to know a place\r\nWe kept the pace but we're done pretending\r\nWe'll fall blindly through the fairy tale endings\r\nThey tried to sell us the convenience and conformity\n\nThose are the images of the man that I want to be\n\nRise up if you agree\n\n\n\nAnd let your freak flags fly\n\nWe’re all messed up inside\n\nAnd forced to act like everything's alright\n\nWave those freak flags high\n\nRejected 'til we die\n\nTo hell with tomorrow\n\nJust let your freak flags fly tonight\n\n\n\nWe're taught to fall in line\n\nTaught to know the rules\n\nWe've played the fools and we're over the laughter\n\nThey can't keep us up in the happily ever afters\n\n\n\nThey can't sell us on convenience and conformity\n\nThose are the properties of the people that we want to be\n\nRise up if you agree\n\n\n\nAnd let your freak flags fly\n\nWe’re all messed up inside\n\nAnd forced to act like everything's alright\n\nWave those freak flags high\n\nRejected 'til we die\n\nTo hell with tomorrow\n\nJust let your freak flags fly tonight\n\n\n\nWe form a different mould\n\nStuck in a different skin\n\nWe will never back down\n\nWe will never fit in\n\nA different breed\n\nStuck in a different skin\n\nWe will never back down\n\nWe will never fit in\n\n\n\nSo let your freak flags fly\n\nWe’re all messed up inside\n\nAnd forced to act like everything's alright\n\nWave those freak flags high\n\nRejected 'til we die\n\nTo hell with tomorrow\n\nLet your freak flags fly\n\nWe’re all messed up inside\n\nAnd forced to act like everything's alright\n\nWave those freak flags high\n\nRejected 'til we die\n\nTo hell with tomorrow\n\nJust let your freak flags fly tonight",
