Salami\r\nAs I get older\nIdeals fade away\nDoubts get bolder\nMy fears learn to stray\nThe stars lose meaning\nFuture condenses past\nYet I want for nothing\nIn the Age of Glass\n\nThe vetted mason\nSubsequential dreams\nPrimes the mover\nBorn to hatch the scheme\nThe [?]\nAs they learn to dance\nBut there is no evil\n\nIn the Age of Glass\n\nOur planet cascades\nFor times of seamless gloom\nA mirthless quasar\nThe rock, the beast, the new\nFrom death perspective\nAll moves like fields of grass\n'Cause time's still solid\nIn the Age of Glass\n\nYou forgo changes\nAt the haste of your demise\nThe quantum switchblade\nMade of the gods' reprise\nBut logic sculptures\nAre harsh but [?]\nBut there are always winners\n\nIn the Age of Glass\n\nThe bull moves slowly\nThe seamstress tames her class\nThe fractured touch stone\nThe blink of backlog tasks\nThe symbiotics go\nKaleidoscopic\nIdeas turn myopic\nIn the Age of Glass\n\nAs years get shorter\nI see a wiser way\nOld men have oceans\nAs humans have their fields of days\nOur wealth comes cheaply\nOn how we choose to last\n'Cause there are no riches\n\nIn the Age of Glass\n\nIn the Age of Glass\nIn the Age of Glass\nIn the Age of Glass\nIn the Age of Glass\nIn the Age of Glass",
