  "lyrics": "Let me get this straight\r\nWe both want to throw stones\r\nBut we're living in a cheap glass house\r\nAnd every windows broke\r\nIt's a tie for first in the race to the bottom\r\nIt's too close too close to call\n\nAnd that's probably the problem\n\n\n\nJust give me a minute\n\nI want to gather my thoughts\n\nI guess I've never said enough\n\nBut I remember a lot\n\nYou got your hand on the door like it's some kind of warning\n\nGod this is boring\n\n\n\nSo you think we're done, just wait and see\n\nTell me is it fun to get back what you gave to me\n\nAnd if you want me gone and we're at the end of our road\n\nSo long and see ya, finally there's one thing we agree on\n\n\n\nI know it's going down tonight\n\nI know you know you know\n\nWe're not going to be alright\n\n\n\nJust give me a minute\n\nI want to gather my thoughts\n\nI guess I've never said enough\n\nBut I remember a lot\n\n\n\nIf youâ€™re mad at me now it's just a matter of time\n\nAnd I'm so over reading between the lines\n\n\n\nThis is broken let's break it some more\n\nFinally there's something we agree on",
