  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino par Arctic Monkeys\r\nJesus in the day spa filling out the information form\nMama got her hair done\nJust popping out to sing a protest song\nI've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark\n\nGood afternoon\nTranquility Base Hotel and Casino\nMark speaking\nPlease tell me how may I direct your call?\n\nThis magical thinking\nFeels as if it really might catch on\nMama wants some answers\n\nDo you remember where it all went wrong?\nTechnological advances\nReally bloody get me in the mood\nPull me in close on a crisp eve baby\nKiss me underneath the moon's side boob\n\nGood afternoon\nTranquility Base Hotel and Casino\nMark speaking\nPlease tell me how may I direct your call?\nDo you celebrate your dark side\nThen wish you'd never left the house?\nHave you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?\n\nGood afternoon\nTranquility Base Hotel and Casino\nMark speaking\n\nPlease tell me how may I direct your call?",
