Don't touch on me with them dedos\r\nI minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos\r\nI want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it\n\nI'm one-handed like Odell\n\nNumb the pain like Orajel\n\nUp and down like gopher bear, hand on me like oh well\n\nWhat that smell like, oh, Chanel, way too deep like depths in hell\n\nNeed a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy\n\nTalking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh don't forget me\n\n\n\nRadiation is present, got my reflection iridescent\n\nEvery little moment I step in, might shift the planets direction\n\nGlitch in the system is present, you might wanna check the connection\n\nI don't give a fuck about freshmans, I don't give a fuck about veterans\n\nIf your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension\n\nOf my energy, this shit only happens once in a century\n\nIt's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary\n\nParadiddles hidden in riddles so vapid and accessory\n\nSo please don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken\n\nDidn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this name\n\nAin't no acting complacent\n\nThey disrespect been too blatant\n\nWe claim this spot from the basement, tell me who you again\n\nOh you was this, you was that\n\nBut now you washed and you hate it\n\nYou taking shots with revolvers, I got two drones at the station\n\nI hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant\n\nYou paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with aging\n\n\n\nWe get money get dough, dame más mi princesa says so\n\nEven though my teeth not gold, Baby girl know our pockets drip folds\n\nWe get money get dough, dame más mi princesa says so\n\nEven though my teeth not gold, Baby girl know our pockets drip folds\n\n\n\nMoney on my-, Money on my-\n\nNiggas that I-, Niggas that I-\n\nWe said what's up-, We said what's up-\n\nMessage that I-, Message that I-\n\nCall her brother-, Call her brother-\n\nNiggas lookin'-, Niggas lookin'-\n\nLet my niggas-, Let my niggas-\n\nNiggas with that-, Niggas with that-",
