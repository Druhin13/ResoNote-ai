  "lyrics": "The city feels clean this time of night\r\nJust empty streets and me walking home to clear my head\r\nI know it came as no surprise\r\nI'm affected more than I had guessed on what was said\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see how it's broken\n\n\n\nIt's the quiet time before the dawn\n\nAnd I'm half past making sense of it, was I wrong?\n\n\n\nShould I claim to give it all\n\nIn a world where not much ever seems to last long\n\n\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see it's broken\n\n\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see how it's broken\n\n\n\nHow it's broken...\n\n\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see it's broken\n\n\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see how it's broken\n\n\n\nHow it's broken...\n\n\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see it's broken\n\n\n\nIf the smile's not meant to be\n\nIf the heart's not ready to open\n\nIf we make it I won't see how it's broken\n\n\n\nHow it's broken...\n\n\n\n(Thanks to manuela for these lyrics)",
