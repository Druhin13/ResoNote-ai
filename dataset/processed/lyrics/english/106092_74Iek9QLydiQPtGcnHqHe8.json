  "lyrics": "Now the sun is low, towering over me\r\nDon’t know where to go, city is all I see yeah\r\nHang at the chateau, Boulevard royalty\r\nI’m caught up in the glow, stumbling for what I need\r\nPassing the hours, missing you like wildfire\n\nI do...\n\nGive me your hours, I could lay with you all day\n\nWith you...\n\n\n\nBaby we’ll stop paying all our deadlines, watch the lights flicker out\n\nWe’ll drive north out of the city, make our own little town\n\nWhen the love is running over, wear your heart like a crown\n\nI’m getting so tired, man f*ck LA\n\nWe could make a wild fire getaway…\n\nWe could make a wild fire getaway...\n\n\n\nI feel it in my knees trembling under me\n\nYou’re the sanity buried inside these streets, yeah\n\nI’m jealous of the breeze rambling so easy\n\nI wish it would sweep me through misty mountains alone with you…\n\n\n\nGotta get away, lose track of time and space\n\nNeed it every day search for the sweet escape\n\nIn a quiet place,\n\nwe’ll make a getaway… \n\nwe’ll make a getaway…\n\nwe’ll make a getaway…\n\n\n\nBaby we’ll stop paying all our deadlines, watch the lights flicker out\n\nWe’ll drive north out of the city make our own little town\n\nWhen the love is running over wear your heart like a crown\n\nI’m getting so tired, man f*ck LA\n\nWe could make a wild fire getaway…\n\nWe could make a wild fire getaway...",
