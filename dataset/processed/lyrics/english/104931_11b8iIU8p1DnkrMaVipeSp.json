  "lyrics": "Burning on an autumn night\r\nA piece of me has been set alight\r\nMoving like a locomotive\r\nTo tear you up and take your wife away\r\nComing down like Christmas lights\n\nStrung up on these walls for countless nights\n\nDouse my house in gasoline\n\nStrike a match and walk—\n\nAway, yeah\n\n\n\nFeeding on the fainting models\n\nHey, yeah\n\nWhite meat festival, yeah\n\nHey, yeah\n\nOcean filled with plastic bottles\n\nHey, yeah\n\nAnd tidal waves will wash us all away\n\nWash us all away-ay-ay\n\n\n\nI’m turning in this burning wreck\n\nShattered windshield, broken back\n\nCrawling on your arms to safety\n\nBefore the flames take your life away\n\n\n\nStanding with stiletto heels\n\nFeed me pills and happy meals\n\nLeave me here to bleed out slowly\n\nSmile, spit, swiftly walk—\n\nAway, yeah\n\n\n\nFeeding on the fainting models\n\nHey, yeah\n\nWhite meat festival, yeah\n\nHey, yeah\n\nOcean filled with plastic bottles\n\nHey, yeah\n\nAnd tidal waves will wash us all away\n\n\n\nThey left us here to wander\n\nThey left us here to stay\n\nOur dreams were torn asunder\n\nAnd quickly washed away\n\n\n\nStranded in the ocean\n\nLost our only hope\n\nAbandoned here and broken\n\nCost us everything we own\n\n\n\nHey yeah\n\nFeeding on the fainting models\n\nHey, yeah\n\nWhite meat festival, yeah\n\nHey, yeah\n\nOcean filled with plastic bottles\n\nHey, yeah\n\nAnd tidal waves will wash us all away\n\nWash us all away-ay-ay\n\nWash us all away-ay-ay\n\nWash us all away-ay-ay\n\nWash us all away-ay-ay",
