  "lyrics": "I think the party's over\r\nAnd it's all about to change\r\nCouldn't last forever\r\nDoesn't matter what they say\r\nAnd all the chandeliers are broken\r\nAnd the doors are blowing open\n\n\n\nThis old hall decomposed\n\nAnd the walls are slowly breaking down to stone\n\nWhen the vultures come to greet you\n\nThey'll be smiling very sweetly\n\nAs they pick your bones\n\nWe've been sold down the river, now we're never going home\n\n\n\nI think the party's over\n\nIt's been going on too long\n\nAnd I can hear some music\n\nI don't recognize the song\n\nAnd there's nobody left dancing\n\nCause the floors are caving in\n\n\n\nAnd this old hall decomposed\n\nAnd the walls are slowly breaking down to stone\n\nWhen the vultures come to greet you\n\nThey'll be smiling very sweetly\n\nAs they pick your bones\n\nWe've been sold down the river, now we're never going home\n\n\n\nAnd nature takes back what it's owed\n\nAnd all that remains is overgrown\n\nBut life will have its way\n\n\n\nOne day there'll be another home, I suppose\n\nAnd the walls will slowly rise up from the stone\n\nWhen the vultures come to meet you\n\nYou'll be smiling very sweetly\n\n'Cause you know\n\nWe survived the river, I think we're coming home",
