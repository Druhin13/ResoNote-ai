  "lyrics": "They're profiting from your worry\r\nSelling blanks down at the DMZ\r\nBanking on the sound and fury\r\nWonder what it's to do with me\r\nBloodless for now\n\n\n\nI'm keeping mine with the altruists\n\nPutting my weight behind the dancer\n\nI know it's hard to be an optimist\n\nWhen you trust least the ones who claim to have the answers\n\n\n\nAnd it's an uncivil war\n\n\n\nBloodless for now\n\n\n\nAnd the poets they explode like bombs\n\nWhile the gentry is drinking Moet Chandon\n\nTurn around and quote a well known psalm:\n\nDon't you worry 'bout the wicked\n\nDon't you envy those who do wrong\n\nAnd your innocence will be like the dawn\n\nWhile the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun\n\n\n\nThe best have lost their convictions\n\nWhile the worst keep\n\nSharpening their claws\n\nPeddling in their dark fictions\n\nWhile what's left of us we just hem and we haw\n\n\n\nAnd it feels like 1936\n\nIn Catalonia\n\nCatalonia",
