  "lyrics": "Warm friend we had a ball\r\nAnd we knew we had it good\r\nCamps to kitsch and shoes to fall\r\nWe called it when we could\r\nCold front\n\nThe undertoe\n\nEasy come and easy good\n\nThat's how the story blows\n\nFor wires on a fence\n\n\n\nIt's a critical equation\n\nIt's a mother of the moon\n\nWhen they're calling for a mixture\n\nA little doom and gloom\n\n\n\nStorm front\n\nRain will fall\n\nIn the eye and in the mud\n\nGet them drunk on alcohol\n\nGet them ready for the flood\n\n\n\nIt's a sensitive subject\n\nFor a criminal mind\n\nSo I'm taking my number\n\nI'm getting out of line\n\nIt's a critical equation\n\n\n\nIt's a critical equation\n\nIt's a mother of the moon\n\nAnd they're calling for a mixture\n\nA little doom and gloom\n\nBut it's a sensitive subject\n\nFor a criminal mind\n\nSo I'm taking my number\n\nI'm getting out of line\n\n\n\nIt's a critical equation",
