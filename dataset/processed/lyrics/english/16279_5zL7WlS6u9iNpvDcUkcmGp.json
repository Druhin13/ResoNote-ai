  "lyrics": "I'm hiding from mirrors\r\nI'm frightened of sex\r\nDespising my image\r\nI'm enlightened and slightly obsessed\r\nIn the dark everything it looks better, whoa\n\nHollywood forever\n\nIn the dark everything it feels better, whoa\n\nHollywood forever\n\nI'm scared I'm a loser\n\nAware of my face\n\nMy father was a user\n\nAnd I'm afraid I'm just the same\n\n\n\nI used to be so confident\n\nSo sober and awake\n\nI never thought to act\n\nDevoted and ashamed\n\nWanted to call my ex\n\nTo hear him say my name\n\nOver the phone to me\n\n\n\nIn the dark everything it looks better, whoa\n\nHollywood forever\n\nIn the dark everything it feels better, whoa\n\nHollywood forever\n\n\n\nIn a house on a cliff on the coast\n\nWell I prayed to my god with a toast\n\nSaid a cheers to the reasons I've been at it all evening\n\nAll I wanted was to never get old\n\nOn a bed in a room with a key\n\nI was reading a rag magazine\n\nSaid a cheers to the demons who've been with me all evening\n\nAll I wanted was to never be seen\n\n\n\nIn the dark everything it looks better, whoa\n\nHollywood forever\n\nIn the dark I'm alive, I'm a legend, whoa\n\nHollywood forever\n\nIn the dark everything it looks better, whoa\n\nHollywood forever",
