  "lyrics": "Hi handsome, it’s mom\r\nIt's one of those evenings in which I'm reflecting on the power of love\r\nI once read that human beings we’re always operating from a place of love or a place of fear\r\nOperating through a place of fear can paralyze the nation let alone an individual\r\nBut when we operate from a place of love, fear has no power over us\r\nLiving inside of love, being love itself, we're able to generate experiences that are limitless, harmonious, competent, and calling\n\nTe amo",
