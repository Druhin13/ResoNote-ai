  "lyrics": "I've never been one to ask for help\r\nIf I need a mountain moved I move it myself\r\nI ain't the church pew regular, twice on sunday\r\nQuote you the scripture kind\r\nI'm far from a preacher\r\nBut I'm a believer\n\n\n\n'Cause every single day, before I knew your name\n\nI couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you\n\nEvery heartbreak trail when all hope fell\n\nOn the highway to hell, I prayed for you\n\nI kept my faith like that old King James\n\nSaid I'm supposed to\n\nIt's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\n\nI didn't know you from Adam but I prayed for you\n\n\n\nFor Someone to love me like you do\n\nGraceful eyes to see me through\n\nA smile that steals me, a heart that heals me\n\nA touch that kills me too\n\nBaby your perfect, I guess the Good Lord heard it\n\n\n\n'Cause every single day, before I knew your name\n\nI couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you\n\nEvery heartbreak trail when all hope fell\n\nOn the highway to hell, I prayed for you\n\nI kept my faith like that old King James\n\nSaid I'm supposed to\n\nIt's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\n\nI didn't know you from Adam but I prayed for you\n\n\n\nEvery single day, before I knew your name\n\nI couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you\n\nEvery tail light fade in the goodbye rain\n\nGirl even today, I prayed for you\n\nI kept my faith like that old King James\n\nSaid I'm supposed to\n\nIt's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\n\nI didn't know you from Adam but I prayed for you\n\nI prayed for you\n\nI prayed for you",
