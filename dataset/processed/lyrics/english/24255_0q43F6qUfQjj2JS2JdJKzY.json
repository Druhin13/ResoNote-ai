  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Diggin' in the Dirt par Neil Young\r\nThere's a bunch of boulders down in the valley\nUnder everyone there's a jewel\nMaybe I should go down there\nFind out for myself\nMaybe I'm somebody's fool\n\nThere's a bunch of boulders down in the valley\nAnd under everyone there's a jewel\nMaybe I should go down there\nFind out for myself\nMaybe I'm somebody's fool\n\nDiggin' in the dirt, that's our way of life\nDiggin' through the day and through the night\nDiggin' for the things that'll make us feel alright\n\nDiggin' in the dirt\n\nWell, the moon's so big and round\nIt's hard to keep our feet on the ground\n'Cause every time we play it they start to fly\nWe're floating around in space\nBut we can't forget our place\nWe keep diggin' in the dirt\n\nDiggin' in the dirt, that's our way of life\nDiggin' through the day and through the night\nDiggin' for the things that'll make us feel alright\nDiggin' in the dirt",
