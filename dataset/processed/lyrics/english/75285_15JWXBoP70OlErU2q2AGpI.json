  "lyrics": "You may think that I'm talking foolish\r\nYou've heard that I'm wild and I'm free\r\nYou may wonder how I can promise you now\r\nThis love, that I feel for you, always will be\r\nYou're not just time that I'm killing\n\nI'm no longer one of those guys\n\nAs sure as I live this love that I give\n\nIs gonna be yours until the day that I die  oh, baby\n\n\n\nI'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever, amen\n\nAs long as old men sit and talk about the weather\n\nAs long as old women sit and talk about old men\n\n\n\nIf you wonder how long I'll be faithful\n\nI'll be happy to tell you again\n\nI'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, amen\n\n\n\nThey say that time takes it's toll on a body\n\nMakes the young girls brown hair turn grey\n\nBut honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair\n\nAnd if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway\n\n\n\nThey say that time can play tricks on a memory,\n\nmake people forget things they knew.\n\nwell, it's easy to see it's happening to me\n\nI've already forgotten every woman but you  oh, darling\n\n\n\nI'm gonna love you forever, forever and ever, amen\n\nAs long as old men sit and talk about the weather\n\nAs long as old women sit and talk about old men\n\n\n\nIf you wonder how long I'll be faithful\n\nwell, just listen to how this song ends\n\nI'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, amen\n\nI'm gonna love you forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever, forever and ever, amen",
