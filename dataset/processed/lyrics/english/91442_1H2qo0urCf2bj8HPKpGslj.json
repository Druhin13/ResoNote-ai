  "lyrics": "Ferris wheel lit up like a roman candle\r\nCounty fair on the square like a movie scene\r\nShe had her raspberry lips kissin' on a candy apple\r\nShe had me wrapped around her finger like a promise ring\r\nFalling like the leaves in late September\n\nWalked the whole way home with her hand in mine\n\nYes, there were fireworks in the night air I remember\n\nThere were fireworks in the first long kiss goodnight\n\n\n\nYeah the days in your life\n\nThey'll fly by if you let 'em\n\nSo go and get 'em, don't you let 'em get away\n\nYeah go on and raise one up high\n\nChase that moon, paint that sky\n\nYou might as well raise some hell along the way\n\n'Cause it ain't the days in your life\n\nIt's the life in your days\n\n\n\nClear blue water in a white rock quarry\n\n45 feet high, scared to death\n\nWe all thought, someday this would make a damn good story\n\nSo we all got just buzzed enough and jumped off the edge\n\n\n\nYeah the days in your life\n\nThey'll fly by if you let 'em\n\nSo go and get 'em, don't you let 'em get away\n\nYeah go on and raise one up high\n\nChase that moon, paint that sky\n\nYou might as well raise some hell along the way\n\n'Cause it ain't the days in your life\n\nIt's the life in your days\n\n\n\nYeah the days in your life\n\nThey'll fly by if you let 'em\n\nSo go and get 'em, don't you let 'em get away\n\nYeah go on and raise one up high\n\nChase that moon, paint that sky\n\nYou might as well raise some hell along the way\n\n'Cause it ain't the days in your life\n\nNo, it ain't the days in your life\n\nNo, it ain't the days in your life\n\nIt's the life in your days\n\nHmm-hmmmm, life in your days",
