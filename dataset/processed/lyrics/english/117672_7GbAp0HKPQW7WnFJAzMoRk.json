  "lyrics": "This hurts like hell\r\nBut I keep telling myself\r\nIt's gonna get better\r\nBut it's taking forever\r\nI tried to go out\r\nBut every time I leave the house\n\nSomething reminds me\n\nOf what's now behind me\n\n\n\nCause everyday I let go\n\nJust a little bit more\n\n\n\nIn the end I'm gonna be alright\n\nBut it might take a hundred sleepless nights\n\nTo make the memories of you disappear\n\nBut right now I can't see nothing through these tears\n\n\n\nControl my thoughts\n\nConvincing myself it's your loss\n\nI really mean it\n\nAnd I'm starting to believe it\n\n\n\nCause everyday I let go\n\nJust a little bit more\n\n\n\nIn the end I'm gonna be alright\n\nBut it might take a hundred sleepless nights\n\nTo make the memories of you disappear\n\nBut right now I can't see nothing through these tears\n\nOut of sight but you're not out of my mind\n\nSo it might take somebody else at night\n\nTo make it feel like you were never here\n\nBut right now I can't see nothing through these tears\n\n\n\nYou said it was over\n\nBut really got closer\n\nYou cried on my shoulder\n\nGoodbye\n\n\n\nIn the end I'm gonna be alright\n\nBut it might take a hundred sleepless nights\n\nTo make the memories of you disappear\n\nBut right now I can't see nothing through these tears\n\nOut of sight but you're not out of my mind\n\nSo it might take somebody else at night\n\nTo make it feel like you were never here\n\nBut right now I can't see nothing through these tears\n\n\n\nDriving home on an empty highway\n\nI thought about you and I hit the brakes\n\nWhat we had and who we were was so clear\n\nBut right now I can't see nothing through these tears",
