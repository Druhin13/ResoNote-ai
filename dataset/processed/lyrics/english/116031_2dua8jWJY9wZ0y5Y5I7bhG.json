  "lyrics": "Last night was a car crash\r\nHighlights made a quick end\r\nLive the high life for the weekends\r\nComing down hard to the sunsets, sinking in\r\nDidn't try hard for a die hard\r\nNothing I consider you, on getting wrong\n\nAnd everybody ask, \"Where you going now?\"\n\nCan you only really want what you don't have enough?\n\nEverything you ever wanted adding up?\n\nYou'd be the reason you can't stand, and now\n\nYou talk a lot, well, act like it\n\nFinally found a way to get myself untangled\n\nAnd I'm dumb, but it's alright (it's alright)\n\nListening and dreaming a long time (long time)\n\nMake sure you play this music when my time's up (time's up)\n\nOh, today I'm done\n\n\n\nSo, if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?\n\n'Cause now we're fading and losing what we wanted most\n\nBut in spite of it, now it feels like the end of the world\n\nSome say these things are for the best\n\nHow are you so sure?\n\n\n\nAnd you can find me when the sea pours into the stars\n\nI'll get there someday\n\nI hope you find everything you think that you want\n\nBruises will fade\n\nTime on our side, we can't wait for it\n\nI'll be doing fine, if you are\n\n'Cause life is but a dream (only it's still deceiving)\n\n\n\nSo, if you loved me, how was I supposed to know?\n\nAnd now we're fading, losing what we wanted most\n\nBut in spite of it, it feels like the end of the world\n\nSome say these things are for the best\n\nBetter or worse",
