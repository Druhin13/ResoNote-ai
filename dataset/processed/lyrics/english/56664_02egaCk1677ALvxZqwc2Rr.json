  "lyrics": "You are who You are\r\nAnd You will never fail to be who You are\r\nAlways on time, always in control\r\nEvery knee should bow, you are Lord of all\r\nSovereign, Sovereign \n\nSovereign, Sovereign\n\nSovereign, Sovereign\n\nSovereign, Sovereign\n\n\n\nFrom the skies to the seas and everything that lies in between\n\nEverything that exists in the universe is dispersed by His decree\n\nHe's infinitely supreme and orchestrates all things\n\nThe One who sits in the Heavens and laughs and does whatever He pleases\n\nWho governs the governments, and establishes kings\n\nThe Prince of Peace who proceeds over prophets, presidents, and priests\n\nWho guides the plans of man but lets that man choose freely\n\nWhile simultaneously exercising divine sovereignty\n\nWho intervenes on the will of man and causes for man to believe\n\nWho appeases the wrath of God that brings peace to his enemies\n\nThe Lord over lords and the King over all earthly kings\n\nThe pervasive power of God displayed through his mighty deeds\n\nThe God of our destiny, the Author and Finisher of faith\n\nWith the power to persuade man, and sway souls for God's sake\n\nThe ultimate source of authority who rules with mercy and grace\n\nBut man reduces this attribute to foolish debate\n\n\n\nYou are who You are\n\nAnd You will never fail to be who You are\n\nAlways on time, always in control\n\nEvery knee should bow, you are Lord of all\n\n\n\nSovereign, Sovereign \n\nSovereign, Sovereign\n\nSovereign, Sovereign\n\nSovereign, Sovereign\n\n\n\nWho does majesty, glory, and power belong to?\n\nWho is righteous in all His ways and never wrong?\n\nWho is God? Sovereign\n\nWho is awesome?\n\nWho do all men depend on for life and breath?\n\nThe author of life and death\n\nThe often overlooked but still He's all seeing, all knowing\n\nHolding all Creation in its place, the God of wrath and grace\n\nThe one who could crush every idol man would rather chase\n\nAnd leads men to the narrow gate, through His crooked paths we navigate\n\nThis world exists cause You've commanded it\n\nSo is Your hand in it?\n\nOr have you handed it over to man and turned away and abandoned it?\n\nDid you try your best and then left man to handle the rest?\n\nWill your plans find success or should we second guess\n\nWhen world leaders all deceive us, eager to puff their chests?\n\nIs life a game of chess? Do you have these kings in check?\n\nWith so much evil how can we believe you're good?\n\nBut I finally understood when I saw that man nailed to wood",
