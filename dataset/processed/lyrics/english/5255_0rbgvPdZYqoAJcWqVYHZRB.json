  "lyrics": "You wake up in the morning after\r\nWondering how the hell did I get here?\r\nYou took some pills just to get some thrills\r\nAlong with 10 or 20 30 beers\r\nNow you wake up every morning\r\nWondering \"What have I done?\"\n\nI gotta leave the old me behind me\n\nI can't pretend this is fun\n\n\n\nNow I say goodbye bad times\n\nGoodbye bad times\n\n\n\nYou feel like hell so you find yourself\n\nThinking back to when you were young\n\nIt always felt like nothing mattered\n\nIt was all about having fun\n\nBut now it seems as you're getting older\n\nWhere are the good old days\n\nCan't remember what you did last night\n\nEverything gets lost in the haze\n\n\n\nNow I say goodbye bad times\n\nGoodbye bad times\n\nNow it's all over, now\n\nNow it's all over, now\n\n\n\nYou find yourself in your prison cell\n\nWasted and alone\n\nYou've lost your friends, it's another dead end\n\nAnd that fault is all your own\n\nYou can fool yourself but something's gotta change\n\nA long way down to bottom out\n\nAnd today might be the day\n\n\n\nThat I say goodbye bad times\n\nGoodbye bad times\n\nNow it's all over, now\n\nNow it's all over, now\n\n\n\nGoodbye to the bad times\n\nGoodbye to the bad times",
