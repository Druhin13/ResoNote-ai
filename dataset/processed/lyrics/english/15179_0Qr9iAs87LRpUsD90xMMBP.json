  "lyrics": "He came on like a mountaineer\r\nExploring beauty through the syllables and cheers\r\nAnd there was, something different in the air\r\nSomething magical, the crowd was unprepared\r\nAnd he was long and lean he held that stage\r\nAnd Jenny looked at me with reverence on her face\n\nAnd she said we left our bodies there that night\n\nCause the music shook our souls and saved our lives\n\n\n\nTonight we radiate\n\nThe lines have been erased\n\nAnd I can't leave this place, leave this place, leave this place\n\n\n\nThis ain't New York or Berlin\n\nIt's just a small town Bringdown, kind of happening\n\nConviction etched upon his face\n\n\n\nCloaked in demin head to toe\n\nHe traded words like souvenirs in stereo\n\nSomething different about this night\n\nCause it was happening right before our eyes\n\n\n\nTonight we radiate\n\nThe lines have been erased\n\nAnd I can't leave this place, leave this place, leave this place\n\n\n\nTonight we radiate, Tonight we radiate\n\nTonight we radiate\n\nThe lines have been erased\n\nAnd I can't leave this, I can't leave this place\n\n\n\nTonight we radiate\n\nThe lines have been replaced\n\nAnd I can't leave this, I can't leave this place\n\n\n\nHe came on like a mountaineer\n\nExploring beauty through the syllables and cheers\n\nAnd there was, something different in the air\n\nSomething magical, the crowd was unprepared",
