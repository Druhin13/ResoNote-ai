  "lyrics": "The bad, the good, the in between\r\nHas left us with no space to breathe\r\nWe both know that this is not where we're supposed to be\r\nBut if only I could set you free\r\nThere's no point playing make believe\r\nOr chasing what we'll never see\n\nAnd reaching in my pocket and I'd hand over the key\n\nBut if only I could set you free\n\nIf only I could set\n\nI'm setting you free\n\n\n\nThe thought of the end is frightening\n\nBut it's all I've been imagining\n\nOoh, I know that you've heard it 'cause I've had you in chains\n\nEven the way you look at me has changed\n\nSo this is my apology\n\nI send this love with honesty\n\n[?] you know it's me\n\nI know it's time that I set you free\n\nI know it's time that I set you free\n\nI know it's time that I set\n\nI'm setting you free\n\n\n\nBut let me hold on to the memory (free)\n\nSo a part of you remains with me\n\nI don't know I ain't right\n\nSo I won't keep you tight\n\nSpread your wings and take flight\n\nI'm setting you free\n\nFree, yeah, I'm setting you free\n\nSetting you free\n\nI can't keep holding you back\n\nSo I know that it's time\n\nI know its time that I set\n\nI'm setting you free\n\n\n\nOh, free, free, free",
