  "lyrics": "At 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone and you're standin' in my porch light\r\nBacksliding\r\nWearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right\r\nBacksliding\r\nWe say we won't, but then we do the same old thing, fallin' right back in\r\nSay it's gonna be the last time\n\nBacksliding, I'm backsliding\n\nBacksliding, I'm backsliding\n\n\n\nWell, I heard that you've been hangin' around with someone new\n\nYeah, word gets around in such a small town\n\nBet you heard I'm seein' someone, too\n\nThere's a million reasons why we should be happy\n\nNot lookin' back, livin' in the past anymore\n\nBut they ain't addin' up, I guess there ain't enough\n\n'Cause here I am\n\n\n\nAt 2 A.M. pickin' up my phone and you're standin' in my porch light\n\nBacksliding\n\nWearin' your old t-shirt in the mornin', it feels so right\n\nBacksliding\n\nWe say we won't, but then we do the same old thing, fallin' right back in\n\nSay it's gonna be the last time\n\nBacksliding, I'm backsliding\n\nBacksliding, I'm backsliding",
