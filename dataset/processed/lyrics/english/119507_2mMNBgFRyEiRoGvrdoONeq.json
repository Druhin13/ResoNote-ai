  "lyrics": "Here lies the lifeless bride and groom\r\nTill’ death do us part came far too soon\r\nBuildings burn and people die all of the time\r\nBut I heard that you reap what you sow\r\nSo around and around we go\n\nAnd when you see my face you’ll know\n\n\n\nYou can't save yourself\n\nOr save your soul\n\nWhen you meet the man whose life you stole\n\nWith weathered wings and broken bones\n\nA flight for the fallen flies the crow\n\nYou can’t save yourself\n\n\n\nThese vengeful thoughts trapped underneath\n\nRage, scorn, misery\n\nPayback for what you took from me\n\nHope, love, sanity\n\n\n\nI heard that you reap what you sow\n\nSo here's to believing in ghosts\n\nNow when you see my face you’ll know\n\n\n\nYou can't save yourself\n\nOr save your soul\n\nWhen you meet the man whose life you stole\n\nWith weathered wings and broken bones\n\nA flight for the fallen flies the crow\n\n\n\nNo forgiveness, just farewell\n\nFrom the match made in heaven\n\nYou sent straight to hell\n\nNo forgiveness, no escape\n\nMay you rest in pieces\n\nFor your grave mistake\n\nFor your grave mistake\n\n\n\nYou can't save yourself\n\nOr save your soul\n\nWhen you meet the man whose life you stole\n\nWith weathered wings and broken bones\n\nA flight for the fallen flies the crow\n\nYou can't save yourself\n\n\n\nNo, you can't save yourself\n\nFor your grave mistake\n\nYou can't save yourself",
