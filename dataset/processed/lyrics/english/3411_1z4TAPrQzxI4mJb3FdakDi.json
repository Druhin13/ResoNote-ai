  "lyrics": "I feel it coming on, something is changing us\r\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\r\nInto the night when the shadows in my head come out to play\r\nNot gonna fight 'cause I know that there is no way to escape\r\nBlack out the sun, I've come undone, my thoughts are racing\n\nThey're out for blood, can't get enough, can't get enough\n\n\n\nI see what I'm becoming, as a part of me now\n\nPacing, I can't shake this\n\nI tell myself it's nothing, but I know deep down\n\nNo matter what I do, it's gonna find a way out\n\n\n\nI feel it coming on, something is changing us\n\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\n\nI feel it coming on, the dark before the dawn\n\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\n\n\n\nParalyzed by the creatures that are creeping in my mind\n\nAnd I won't hide 'cause I know they're gonna find me every time\n\nBlack out the sun, I've come undone, my thoughts are racing\n\nThey're out for blood, can't get enough, can't get enough\n\n\n\nI see what I'm becoming, it's a part of me now\n\nCaving, I can't take this\n\nI'm trying not to hold it 'cause I know deep down\n\nNo matter what I do, it's gonna find a way out\n\n\n\nI feel it coming on, something is changing us\n\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\n\nI feel it coming on, the dark before the dawn\n\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\n\n\n\nI tell myself it's nothing, but I know deep down\n\nNo matter what I do, it's gonna find a way out\n\n\n\nI feel it coming on, something is changing us\n\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\n\nI feel it coming on, the dark before the dawn\n\nAnd when the sun goes down, we've got nowhere to run\n\nWe've got nowhere to run",
