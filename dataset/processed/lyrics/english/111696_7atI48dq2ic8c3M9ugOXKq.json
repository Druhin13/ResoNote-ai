  "lyrics": "Pretty soon we were takin' it serious\r\nMe and you underneath a mysterious spell\r\nNothin' I could do and it suddenly felt like a bolt out of hell\r\nI'm tellin' you\r\nTo the sound of the beat I was hanging on\r\nLike a powerful truth, it was banging on me\n\nWouldn't let me go\n\nLike a shot in the dark she was hot like a spark\n\nI only know\n\nNeither one of us trying to hold it down\n\nNeither one of us taking the middle ground\n\nWasn't how to make sense we were thinkin' of\n\nJust the two of us bent on delirious love\n\nMe and you being spent on delirious love\n\nLike a ride on a rocket it took us up\n\nDidn't want it to stop and it shook us up good\n\nWe were moving fast\n\nJust ahead of the law\n\nWe were beggin' for more\n\nAnd what a blast\n\nComin' round to a new kind of view of it\n\nNever did it before we were doin' it now\n\nAnd I gotta say it was easy to give\n\nWas a reason to live another day\n\nNeither one of us stopping to figure out\n\nWhat the roll and the rockin' was all about\n\nAll we knew was that we couldn't get enough\n\nYou and me in the heat of delirious love\n\nMakin' time to the beat of delirious love\n\nI can feel it\n\nI can feel it\n\nI can feel it\n\n\n\nCome down had a new kind of view of it\n\nWouldn't do it before we were doin' it now\n\nAnd I gotta say it was easy to give\n\nWas a reason to live another day\n\nNeither one of us stoppin' to figure out\n\nWhat the roll and the rockin' was all about\n\nAll we knew was that we couldn't get enough\n\nYou and me in the heat of delirious love\n\nMakin' time to the beat of delirious love\n\nYou and me gettin' sweet on delirious love",
