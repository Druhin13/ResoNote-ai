  "lyrics": "We see light pass through the door\r\nDown through the lasting nighttime\r\nYou've had the back seat lately\r\nShe just left right through the door\r\nOut to the breaking day\r\nYou've left without a trace this morning\n\n\n\nNever really read between the lines\n\nNever heard a word or saw the signs\n\nThere were just a few who always knew\n\nThat rain would follow marble skies\n\n\n\nRolling in the darkness of your mind\n\nColouring the water of your life\n\nLook across the plain, the shadow\n\nSoon the fields will bloom again someday\n\n\n\nTake us as we are\n\nWe have gone too far\n\nLet the water rise\n\nWe have found the way, marble skies\n\n\n\nNow we've all been told\n\nThat we were all sold\n\nIf taking a footing and everything with it\n\nBack into a land\n\nWhere it all began\n\nThey're finding the pathways that are overgrowing\n\n\n\nNever really read between the lines\n\nNever heard a word or saw the signs\n\nThere were just a few who always knew\n\nThat rain would follow marble skies\n\n\n\nRolling in the darkness of your mind\n\nColouring the water of your life\n\nLook across the plain, the shadow\n\nSoon the fields will bloom again someday\n\n\n\nTake us as we are\n\nWe have gone too far\n\nLet the water rise\n\nWe have found the way, marble skies\n\n\n\nI knew that we ran along\n\nInto darkness, we pull this along\n\nIn the light with a false [?] too\n\nIn corroding the front you had to\n\n\n\nTake us as we are\n\nWe have gone too far\n\nLet the water rise\n\nWe have found the way, marble skies\n\n\n\nTake us as we are\n\nWe have gone too far\n\nLet the water rise\n\nWe have found the way, marble skies",
