  "lyrics": "All the little gifts you gave\r\nI call it over compensating\r\nFeeling just like a princess\r\nEvery answer was always yes\r\nYou had me living in a dream\r\nWas forever long to you?\n\nDid you say that to her too?\n\nMaking sure that I’d never know\n\nCallin' her while the shower goes\n\nThen crawl back in bed, it's a shame\n\n\n\nI probably should’ve known better\n\nI probably should’ve known better\n\nEvery word you said, yeah, you was sweet but you was lying\n\nEverything you covered up, making up, just to keep to me from crying, oh\n\n\n\nI wish that you woulda treated me bad\n\nThe truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better\n\nNow I’m left feeling twice as sad\n\nI wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad\n\nI wish that you woulda treated me bad\n\nTruth is, you couldn’t have loved me better\n\nNow I’m left feeling twice as sad\n\nI wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad\n\n\n\nI wasn’t catching on to you\n\nBlinded by your lips, so smooth\n\nExcusing all of your 'gotta go's'\n\nLeaving me to be all alone\n\nThen you took my heart just the same\n\n\n\nI probably should’ve known better\n\nI probably should’ve known better\n\nEvery word you said, yeah, you was sweet but you was lying\n\nEverything you covered up, making up, just to keep to me from crying, oh\n\n\n\nI wish that you woulda treated me bad\n\nThe truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better\n\nNow I’m left feeling twice as sad\n\nI wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad\n\nI wish that you woulda treated me bad\n\nTruth is, you couldn’t have loved me better\n\nNow I’m left feeling twice as sad\n\nI wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad\n\n\n\nTell me the truth\n\nWas it worth it? Was I worth it for you?\n\n'Cause we were perfect, we working til you\n\nForgot to tell me you been seeing someone else for six years, oh\n\n\n\nI wish that you woulda treated me bad\n\nThe truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better\n\nNow I’m left feeling twice as sad\n\nI wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad\n\nI wish that you woulda treated me bad\n\nTruth is, you couldn’t have loved me better\n\nNow I’m left feeling twice as sad\n\nI wish you woulda treated me bad bad bad",
