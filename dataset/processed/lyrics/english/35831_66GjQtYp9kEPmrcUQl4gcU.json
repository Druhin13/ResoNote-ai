  "lyrics": "Corrupt ignobility adorned in pilfered gold\r\nConceived in sewage by insipid lords of old\r\nInbred degenerates languish in squalid halls\r\nImpotent and superfluous, unable to uphold\r\nThe basic tennets of the creed\n\nUsurpers vie to supersede\n\nA tired waning hegemony, long bereft of majesty\n\n\n\nSelf-righteous justiciars desire to purify\n\nA world of lies, that seeks to purge the earth and sky\n\nLicentious seditionists; gorge as your planet burns\n\nFrom slime they came, and into slime they shall return\n\n\n\nPraise the primordial poison pools that gave us form\n\nTo defy his decree, they dare to bite the hand that feeds\n\n\n\nThe custodians have become the abuser\n\nIgnorant beings with arrogant ideas\n\n\n\nThey loose a hail of arrows\n\nThat scorch the eyes of all who gaze\n\nBut it won't save them from the hell that waits\n\n\n\nMythologised transcendance, a paradise is lost\n\nNo deliverence from the dire cost\n\n\n\nThey've chosen the form of the destructor\n\nMore of slime than blood\n\nTheir planet torn asunder by plutonium\n\n\n\nMercury rising, the surface scorched\n\nThey descend like rats into the bowels of earth\n\n\n\nDigging like roaches through a mire\n\nOf their own self indulgence\n\nCaught in a web of fate\n\nToo bloodless to escape\n\n\n\nNo god can save you now\n\nFor they have no power here\n\nWithin these ashen crypts\n\nOf suffering and despair\n\n\n\nThe flame ignited in it's heart\n\nA chain reaction tearing apart\n\nReaching the critical mass\n\nThe weapon of their futile vengeance\n\n\n\nThe eye, ablaze with radiance\n\nThat sears against your flesh\n\nDread rumbling in the deep\n\nSignalling the impending death\n\n\n\nBlinded by a caustic storm\n\nThe slamming of cyclopean doors\n\nHeld aloft the orb ignites\n\nNowhere to run now from the light\n\n\n\nNow standing in the presence of a foe conceived by alien gods\n\nNever again to feel the sun, it immolates you\n\nThe Lifeage of the universe, a wind that sweeps the world away\n\nYou feel the weight of every world bearing down on you",
