  "lyrics": "I've been cheated by you since I don't know when\r\nSo I made up my mind, it must come to an end\r\nLook at me now, will I ever learn?\r\nI don't know how, but I suddenly\r\nLose control\n\nThere's a fire within my soul...\n\n\n\nJust one look and I can hear a bell ring\n\nOne more look and I forget everything, woah-oh oh-oh\n\n\n\nMamma mia, here I go again\n\nMy my, how can I resist you?\n\nMamma mia, does it show again?\n\nMy my, just how much I've missed you\n\n\n\nYes, I've been brokenhearted\n\nBlue since the day we parted\n\nWhy, why did I ever let you go?\n\n\n\nMamma mia, now I really know\n\nMy my, I could never let you go\n\n\n\nI've been angry and sad about things that you do\n\nI can't count all the times that I've told you we're through\n\n\n\nAnd when you go, when you slam the door\n\nI think you know that you won't be\n\nAway too long\n\nYou know that I'm not that strong...\n\n\n\nJust one look and I can hear a bell ring\n\nOne more look and I forget everything, woah-oh oh-oh\n\n\n\nMamma mia, here I go again\n\nMy my, how can I resist you?\n\nMamma mia, does it show again?\n\nMy my, just how much I've missed you\n\n\n\nYes, I've been brokenhearted\n\nBlue since the day we parted\n\nWhy, why did I ever let you go?\n\n\n\nMamma mia, even if I say\n\nBye bye, leave me now or never\n\nMamma mia, it's a game we play\n\nBye bye doesn't mean forever\n\n\n\nMamma mia, here I go again\n\nMy my, how can I resist you?\n\nMamma mia, does it show again?\n\nMy my, just how much I've missed you\n\n\n\nYes, I've been brokenhearted\n\nBlue since the day we parted\n\nWhy, why did I ever let you go?\n\n\n\nMamma mia, now I really know\n\nMy my, I could never let you go...",
