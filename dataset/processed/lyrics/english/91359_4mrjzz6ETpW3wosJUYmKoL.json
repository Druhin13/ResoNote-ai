  "lyrics": "I saw you staring out of your own abyss again\r\nWaiting for something you're not sure even still exists\r\nDon't be afraid to wonder, don't be afraid to be scared\r\nIt should never be a prison\r\nSo I apologise if you feel something\r\nBut love is all we have, feel something (I know)\n\nOr if I steal something, please, remember it was mine\n\nReal something",
