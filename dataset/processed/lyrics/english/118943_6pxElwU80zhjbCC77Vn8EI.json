  "lyrics": "\"My cheek brushes against his\r\nSmooth on stubble for a moment\r\nAnd then it's gone\r\nHe walks along the platforms into the dream\r\nEvery fiber in me wants to shout and scream\r\n'Stop!'\n\nTo run across to him, take him into my arms\n\nTo tell him, 'I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!'\n\nBut instead I stand still\n\nHeart cracking\n\nThe little curls on the back of his head bouncing\n\nAs he steps out of my life, forever.\"\n\n\n\nI hope\n\nThat the fire we both made\n\nStill burns a little in you\n\nI wrote, to you\n\nEveryday, did my letters find their way?\n\nOur memories on my screen\n\nTwo lovers in this mystic dream\n\nBaby come back to me, come back to me\n\nToo much time on my phone\n\nBaby do you still sleep alone?\n\nCome back to me, come back to me\n\n\n\nRemember me\n\nFresh out a black and white movie, movie\n\nOn every screen\n\nWhat would you realize\n\nWhat you meant to me, or was it mystery?\n\nRemember me\n\nFresh out a black and white movie, movie\n\nOn every screen\n\nWhat would you realize\n\nWhat you meant to me, was a mystery\n\n\n\nI heard\n\nThat you moved somewhere far away\n\nIs your number the same as before?\n\nCan't ignore, the time\n\nMay have changed your ways\n\nDoes my record still hang on your wall?\n\nSuch a sentimental way to groove\n\nI hope it still touches you\n\nBaby come back to me, come back to me\n\nIt kills me to see you leave\n\nSo I came home and made this beat\n\nBaby come back to me, come back to me\n\n\n\nRemember me\n\nFresh out a black and white movie, movie\n\nOn every screen\n\nWhat would you realize\n\nWhat you meant to me, was a mystery\n\nRemember me\n\nFresh out a black and white movie, movie\n\nOn every screen\n\nWhat would you realize\n\nWhat you meant to me, was a mystery\n\n\n\nRemember me, let's set the scene\n\nYou and me, what could've been\n\nStill swimming in a lover's dream\n\nStill playing on the movie screens\n\nRemember me, let's set the scene\n\nYou and me, what could've been\n\nStill swimming in a lover's dream\n\nStill playing on the movie screens\n\nRemember me, let's set the scene\n\nYou and me, what could've been\n\nStill swimming in a lover's dream\n\nStill playing on the movie screens\n\nRemember me, let's set the scene\n\nYou and me, what could've been\n\nStill swimming in a lover's dream\n\nStill playing on the movie screens",
