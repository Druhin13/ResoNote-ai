  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Life Changes par Thomas Rhett\r\nWaking up in my college dorm\nYeah, my life, it was pretty normal\nLooking for a date to the spring formal\nWasn't worried 'bout nothing else, no\nMajoring in Undecided\nNotebook full of bad songs I was writing\nNever dreamed anybody else would like them\nNow they're sitting on a Walmart shelf\n\nAin't it funny how life changes\nYou wake up, ain't nothing the same and life changes\nYou can't stop it, just hop on the train, and\nYou never know what's gonna happen\nYou make your plans and you hear God laughing\nLife changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no\n\nAnd I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no\n\nI bought a ring and she said, \"I do\"\nBut everybody else said, \"Man, you're twenty-two\nWhatcha trying to prove? Hey, why don't you wait?\"\n'Cause I've been waiting on her since the second grade, yeah\nAnd now she got her own set of fans\nShe got a blue check mark by her Instagram\nAnd I wrote a little song about holding her hand\nAnd now everybody wanna die happy, man\n\nAin't it funny how life changes\nYou wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes\nYou can't stop it just hop on the train, and\n\nYou never know what's gonna happen\nYou make your plans and you hear God laughing\nLife changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no\nAnd I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no\n\nI remember the day I told my Daddy and Mama\n\"You're gonna have a grandkid, yep\nFrom Uganda, that's right, we're adopting\nAnd she is the cutest little girl that you've ever seen\"\nWell I was wrapping my head around being a dad\nA big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had\nNow Lauren's showing, got one on the way\nYeah that's two under two, hey, what can I say?\n\n\nAin't it funny how life changes\nYou wake up ain't nothing the same and life changes\nYou can't stop it, just hop on the train, and\nYou never know what's gonna happen\nYou make your plans and you hear God laughing\nLife changes, and I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no\nAnd I wouldn't change it for the world, the world, oh no",
