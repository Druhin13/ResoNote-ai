Virginia in my head\n\nHeartbeat\nHustle and pound\nShe's running down the wrong street\n\nWrong beat\nFaster boy\nNervous Mary had a nervous day\n\nOx blow\nStrange glow\nShe runs for the exit but she never got away\n\n\nRoad goat\nRun but she never got away\nHot road\n(Run for it)\nNervous Mary had a nervous day\n\nBoss\nBetter than stolen\nI'll scream in the meadow 'til you're bold then\n\nAheeyah\nAheeyah\nRun for your life they're coming upon us\n\nOx blow\nStrange glow\nShe runs for the exit but she never got away\n\n\nRoad goat\nRun but she never got away\nHot road\n(Run for it)\nNervous Mary had a nervous day",
