  "lyrics": "While my father built a mansion on the mountain\r\nI was chasing my Teresa around a tree\r\nWe were kicking precious stones\r\nSinking ships and swimming home\r\nOnly crazy for the comfort of our clothes\n\nWhile my father built a mansion on the mountain\n\nMy Teresa dragged a rag across my brow\n\nShe said, \"The weather's never fair\n\nThe wind can only blow your hair\"\n\nAnd I believed her well enough or didn't care\n\n\n\nEveryone knows and they don't know\n\nChandelier light ain't love\n\nIt just watches the time go\n\nAcross the marble floor, out the ornemental door\n\nEven rain can hear it running off the road\n\n\n\nWhile my father built a mansion on the mountain\n\nMy Teresa threw me kisses through the core\n\nWe read the writing on the wall\n\nBraced each other for the fall\n\nThere's only one way off a mountain after all\n\n\n\nWhile my father built a mansion on the mountain\n\nIt was me and my Teresa against the world\n\nWe took all the river had to give\n\nBroke the bed and bought a crib\n\nBut left the mountain mansion, nothing to forget",
