  "lyrics": "When you walk past\r\nThat park near your apartment now\r\nDo you think about me?\r\nDo you think about me?\r\nDo you drive fast?\r\nWhen you realize you're on my street\n\nDo you drive slowly?\n\nDo you think about me?\n\n\n\nThought I could pack up my suitcase and just walk away, walk away (walk away)\n\nLeave you with all the sh*t I didn't want to take, my mistake\n\n\n\nI'm missing you, I'm missing you\n\nWhat the hell did I do? (Did I do?)\n\nMessing with someone new\n\nThinking I wanted to\n\nTurns out I don't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nI'm missing you, I'm missing you\n\nWhat the hell did I do? (Did I do?)\n\nMessing with someone new\n\nThinking I wanted to\n\nTurns out I don't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nDon't want new, I want you\n\nDon't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nI'm in his bed, next to him\n\nBut he don't know\n\nI'm just thinking 'bout you\n\nI'm thinking 'bout you\n\nWhen it's 3AM, and I'm at the diner with his friends\n\nI ain't thinking them\n\nI'm just thinking 'bout you\n\n\n\nThought I could pack up my suitcase and just walk away, walk away (walk away)\n\nLeave you with all the sh*t I didn't want to take, want to take\n\n\n\nI'm missing you, I'm missing you\n\nWhat the hell did I do? (Did I do?)\n\nMessing with someone new\n\nThinking I wanted to\n\nTurns out I don't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nI'm missing you, I'm missing you\n\nWhat the hell did I do? (Did I do?)\n\nMessing with someone new\n\nThinking I wanted to\n\nTurns out I don't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nDon't want new, I want you\n\nDon't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nThought I'd be better without you\n\nI can't stop thinking about you\n\nNow I'm with someone new (I want you)\n\nThought I'd be better without you\n\nI can't stop thinking about you\n\nNow I'm with someone new (I want you)\n\n\n\nI'm missing you, I'm missing you\n\nWhat the hell did I do? (Did I do?)\n\nMessing with someone new\n\nThinking I wanted to\n\nTurns out I don't want new, I want you\n\n\n\nMessing with someone new\n\nThinking I wanted to\n\nTurns out I don't want new, I want you",
