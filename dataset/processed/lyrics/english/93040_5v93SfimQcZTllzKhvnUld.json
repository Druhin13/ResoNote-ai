  "lyrics": "They don't know, they gon’ find out\r\nLets be clear, over here ain't no timeouts\r\nI came here to win, whatchu mad about? (Time Out)\r\nGet up out my lane, you don't have the clout (Time Out)\r\nNothing you can do that’ll stop me now (Time Out)\n\nThe game is on the line and there's no time outs\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nNo, Time Out, Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nIf they don't know, they gonna find out\n\nLet's be clear, over here, ain't no Time Out\n\n\n\nI show better than I tell\n\nSpent the last year stayin’ outta hell\n\nBeen in a knock down, drag out, didn’t foul out\n\nI got up every time I fell\n\nMay think I'm the underdog\n\nBut just watch, I’ma prove you wrong\n\nCause I was made for this moment and prepared for opponents\n\nLook up and I'm taking off\n\nNow it seems like you're shaken up\n\nLook tough, till I called your bluff\n\nYou've been exposed, everybody knows, now you gotta go\n\nThat’s the rules, I ain't make 'em up\n\n'Bout to lose, yuh it's too clear\n\nYou dropped the ball, Happy New Year\n\nEverybody count down, seconds on the clock now, nothing else to see here\n\nYou better call Time Out\n\n\n\nI came here to win, whatchu mad about? (Time Out)\n\nGet up out my lane, you don't have the clout (Time Out)\n\nNothing you can do that'll stop me now (Time Out)\n\nThe game is on the line and there's no time outs\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nNo, Time Out, Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nIf they don't know, they gonna find out\n\nLet's be clear, over here, ain't no Time Out\n\n\n\nIt's the life of a champion\n\nNow I'm catching my second win\n\n(You know) The battle maybe over, but the war got colder\n\nIt gets hard every now and then\n\nSee I was saved as a little kid\n\nKnowing grace covered all I did\n\nI take a look at the past, with the good and the bad\n\nMan, we call that experience\n\nSo I'm planning a strategy\n\nI can't downplay the enemy\n\nCause I'm making another move, bout gettin W's\n\nCementing my legacy\n\nNow tell 'em bring everything they got\n\nAnd I'ma show 'em everything they not\n\nWith the game on the line and the Lord on my side\n\nYou know I live for the final shot\n\nYou better call a Time Out\n\n\n\nI came here to win, whatchu mad about? (Time Out)\n\nGet up out my lane, you don't have the clout (Time Out)\n\nNothing you can do that'll stop me now (Time Out)\n\nThe game is on the line and there's no time outs\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nNo, Time Out, Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nIf they don't know, they gonna find out\n\nLet's be clear, over here, ain't no Time Out\n\n\n\nTake notes if you wanna learn\n\nIt'll stop you from getting burned\n\nThere's a spot on the podium, dive if you wanna swim\n\nThis is one you gotta earn\n\nTrophy's in the showcase\n\nAnd they all sayin' first place\n\nWhen the accolades pile up\n\nIt was only by the Lord's grace\n\nNow the odds are against us\n\nBut it's God who defends us\n\nSo I'm carrying the weight, when I step to the plate\n\nAnd still swing for the fences\n\nGot the coach on the sidelines\n\nTellin' me it's my time\n\nIt sounds cliché, but you know what we say\n\nAlways gotta let you light shine\n\nI'll never call time out\n\n\n\nI came here to win, whatchu mad about? (Time Out)\n\nGet up out my lane, you don't have the clout (Time Out)\n\nNothing you can do that'll stop me now (Time Out)\n\nThe game is on the line and there's no time outs\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nI ain't never calling Time Out\n\nNo, Time Out, Time Out\n\nYou ain't never catchin' Ty Mont\n\nShut it down, turn the lights out\n\nNow we're clear, over here ain't no Time Out",
