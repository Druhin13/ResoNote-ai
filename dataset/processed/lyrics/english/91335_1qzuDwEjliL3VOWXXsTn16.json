  "lyrics": "It's just a sad picture\r\nThe final blow hits you\r\nSomebody else gets\r\nWhat you wanted\r\nYou know\r\nIt's all the same\n\nAnother time and place\n\nRepeating history\n\nJust another episode\n\n\n\nBut I believe\n\nIn whatever you do\n\nAnd I'll do anything\n\nTo see it through\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nBecause these things\n\nWill change\n\nWe can see it now\n\nThese walls\n\nThat they put up\n\nTo hold us back\n\nWill fall down\n\nIt's a revolution\n\nIt's how we'll become\n\nWho we're\n\nSupposed to be\n\nWe'll sing hallelujah\n\nWe'll sing hallelujah\n\nOh\n\n\n\nSo you've been\n\nOut numbered\n\nWhen you've been\n\nOut cornered\n\nIt's time to find\n\nWhat you're\n\nFighting for\n\n\n\nYou're getting\n\nStronger now\n\nFrom things\n\nThey never found\n\nThey might be better\n\nBut we're faster\n\nAnd never scared\n\n\n\nWe've got the ways\n\nThat we can beat this\n\nThere's something\n\nIn your eyes\n\nSays we can beat this\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nBecause these things\n\nWill change\n\nWe can see it now\n\nThese walls\n\nThat they put up\n\nTo hold us back\n\nWill fall down\n\nIt's a revolution\n\nIt's how we'll become\n\nWho we're\n\nSupposed to be\n\nWe'll sing hallelujah\n\nWe'll sing hallelujah\n\nOh\n\n\n\nTonight we're\n\nStanding on our feet\n\nTo fight\n\nFor what we worked\n\nFor all these years\n\nThe battle of long\n\nIt's the fight\n\nOf our lives\n\nWe'll stand up\n\nChampions one\n\nAnd it's the night\n\nWe changed\n\nWe can see it now\n\nWhen the walls\n\nThat they put up\n\nTo hold us\n\nBack fell down\n\nCoz it's a revolution\n\nThrow your hands up\n\nCoz we never give in\n\nWe'll sing hallelujah\n\nWe'll sing hallelujah\n\nHallelujah\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Rafael for these lyrics)",
