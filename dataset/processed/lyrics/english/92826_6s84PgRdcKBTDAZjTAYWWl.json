  "lyrics": "I don't even understand\r\nHow I can find someone again\r\nPeople say just start as friends\r\nBut it ain't easy to pretend, oh\r\nI'm living cigarettes on cigarettes, some nights that I just forget\n\nThose silhouettes of my regrets and my pride\n\nI'm wanting chemistry on chemistry, that fucking vibe I can't believe\n\nThink you could be that remedy I can't find\n\n\n\nYou'll be the right to all my wrongs\n\nI'll be the one to keep you strong\n\nEven when all the love gets drawn\n\nI'll bleed you still\n\nYou'll be the oxygen I breathe\n\nUnder the covers if you need\n\nEven if all your loving leaves\n\nI'll bleed you still, I will\n\n\n\nYou turn my weaknesses, my sins\n\nInto fictions, into myths\n\nGot me saying all this shit\n\nShit I thought I never meant\n\n\n\n'Cause I love those cigarettes on cigarettes, those nights that I just forget\n\nThose silhouettes of my regrets and my pride\n\nI'm wanting chemistry on chemistry, that fucking vibe I can't believe\n\nThink you could be that remedy I can't find\n\n\n\nYou'll be the right to all my wrongs\n\nI'll be the one to keep you strong\n\nEven when all the love gets drawn\n\nI'll bleed you still\n\nYou'll be the oxygen I breathe\n\nUnder the covers if you need\n\nEven if all your loving leaves\n\nI'll bleed you still, I will",
