  "lyrics": "I saw it in your eyes\r\nI saw the creature deep inside\r\nYou opened up your cage\r\nPathetic insect\r\nDrawn to flame\r\nI'm falling apart\n\nInside your holographic heart\n\nLost souls dancing\n\nAnd now the lie's collapsing\n\n\n\nThere's something inside you that isn't right\n\nThere's something that haunts your dreams at night\n\nThere's something that you have lost\n\nAnd you're bringing it down\n\nYou're bringing it down\n\nOn top of us\n\n\n\nI see the crimson thief\n\nHanging on heartstrings\n\nDripping bleach\n\nVictim with hands in sleeves\n\nYour lying swan sings\n\nAs I reach\n\nI'm falling apart\n\nInside your holographic heart\n\nLost souls dancing\n\nAnd now the lie's collapsing\n\n\n\nThere's something inside you that isn't right\n\nThere's something that haunts your dreams at night\n\nThere's something that you have lost\n\nAnd you're bringing it down\n\nYou're bringing it down\n\nOn top of us\n\n\n\nSilly me. I thought I had it\n\nI came so close this time\n\nI knew your heart was plastic\n\nI still thought I could make it mine\n\nSurrender you my mind\n\nYour creature is inside\n\nDevouring me alive\n\n\n\nThere's something inside you that isn't right\n\nSomething that haunts your dreams...\n\nThere's something that you have lost\n\nAnd you're bringing it down\n\nYou're bringing it down\n\nOn top of us",
