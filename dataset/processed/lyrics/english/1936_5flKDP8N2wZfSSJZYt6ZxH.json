  "lyrics": "I wish, I hope, I wonder\r\nWhere you're at sometimes\r\nIs your back against the wall?\r\nOr just across the line\r\nHave you been standing in the rain\r\nReciting nursery rhymes?\n\nTrying to recall\n\nSome long lost kind of peace of mind\n\nPeace of mind\n\nTry spending the night sometime\n\nAll alone in a frozen room\n\nAfterneath you've lain\n\nYour Saddle in the rain\n\n\n\nI dreamed they locked God up\n\nDown in my basement\n\nAnd he waited there for me\n\nTo have this accident\n\nSo he could drink my wine\n\nAnd eat me like a sacrament\n\nAnd I just stood there like I do\n\nThen I came and went\n\nI came and went\n\nLike a bird in a foreign sky\n\nCouldn't even say good bye\n\nOr come and share the pain\n\nMy Saddle's in the rain\n\n\n\nI saw a friend who doesn't know\n\nIf I'm his friend just yet\n\nHis eyes and mouth were widely open\n\nAnd his jaw was set\n\nLike he'd fell off a cliff\n\nAnd hadn't hit the bottom yet\n\nI wish he wouldn't pull those things on me\n\nWithout a net\n\nWithout a net\n\nI had him up to the house one time\n\nAnd we was having a real good time\n\nThen he went and lain\n\nHis Saddle in the rain\n\n\n\nIn a laundromat not too far\n\nFrom the Alamo\n\nSits a girl who stole my records\n\nVery long ago\n\nAnd she wishes, wants and washes\n\nOut those dirty clothes\n\nAs she shuts her eyes and dreams\n\nAbout her one eyed Joe\n\nOne eyed Joe\n\nCar parked on a dirty road\n\nHeaven knows the load she pulled\n\nCouldn't take the strain\n\nA Saddle in the rain",
