  "lyrics": "We both lost our innocence\r\nTo heaven on Las Vegas\r\nBedroom rearranged again\r\nSnow out on the pavement\r\nColors from outside\n\nThey've been orange and white\n\nLet's invite your friends for a backseat drive\n\n\n\nIt's not a crime if you take what's given\n\nIt's just a crime if you're payin' for it\n\nWhat's the fun if you know what's comin'?\n\nI don't want to escape it\n\n\n\nStanding outside of your house\n\nIt's pretty dark out\n\nGood thing there's lights\n\nIt's pretty cold though\n\nI just need you right here\n\nTo warm me up this time\n\n\n\nWhat's done to work off?\n\nYou say I'll never get you off\n\nNow when you stand in a crowd\n\nIs your mind in the gutter?\n\nYour head on the run\n\n(Your head on the run)\n\n\n\nIt's not a crime if you take what's given\n\nIt's just a crime if you're payin' for it\n\nWhat's the fun if you know what's comin'?\n\nI don't want to escape it\n\n\n\nThe plant inside that never seemed to die\n\nYou cut it down before the leaves were brown\n\nThe gate was closed, we know that we're too old\n\nThe pool is cold, the pool is cold\n\n\n\nIt's not a crime if you take what's given\n\nIt's just a crime if you're payin' for it\n\nWhat's the fun if you know what's comin'?\n\nI don't want to escape this feeling\n\nAnd when we tear down the walls completely\n\nAre we left with the same old memories\n\nThere's a song that I still hear faintly\n\nIt's just a recipe for my love\n\nIt's just a recipe for my love",
