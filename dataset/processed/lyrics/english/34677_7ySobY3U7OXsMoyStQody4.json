  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Salvation par Crematory\r\nNo one will do me any favor\nI walk alone in the line\nHopelessly I search for a savior\nSlowly I start to lose my mind\nI stumble in the wrong direction\nIn paradise there is no space\nI see my own last reflection\nI see me lying in a deep, old grave\nSalvation\nI'm the fallen angel\nCrying in the darkness\nHope is out of sight\nSalvation\nSalvation\nYou're my guardian angel\nDying in the darkness\n\nBe my leading light\nBe my leading light\nSalvation\nSalvation\nI lay my soul down in your hand\nThere is a final price to pay\nI'm just about to make my last stand\nGet on my knees and pray\nI follow the false savior\nThe keeper of the past\nTrusted a wrong behavior\nBut he will lead you to the last\nSalvation\nI'm the fallen angel\nCrying in the darkness\nHope is out of sight\nSalvation\nSalvation\n\nYou're my guardian angel\nDying in the darkness\nBe my leading light\nBe my leading light\nSalvation\nSalvation\nUnder the moon I will die\nNobody by my side\nA dark and lonely life\nNobody sees my unforgettable fight\nI stumble in the wrong direction\nIn paradise there is no space\nI see my own last reflection\nI see me lying in a deep, old grave\nSalvation\nI'm the fallen angel\nCrying in the darkness\nHope is out of sight\n\nSalvation\nSalvation\nYou're my guardian angel\nDying in the darkness\nBe my leading light\nBe my leading light\nSalvation\nI'm the fallen angel\nCrying in the darkness\nHope is out of sight\n(Salvation)\nSalvation\nYou're my guardian angel\nDying in the darkness\nBe my leading light\nBe my leading light",
