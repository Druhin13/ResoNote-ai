  "lyrics": "If today was not an endless highway\rIf tonight was not an endless trail\rIf tomorrow wasn't such a long time\rThen lonesome would mean nothing to me at all\rYes and only if my own true love was waiting\rIf I could hear her heart softly pounding\rIf only she was lying by me\rThen I'd lie in my bed once again\rI can't see my reflection in the water\rI can't speak the sounds that show no pain\rI can't hear the echo of my footsteps\rI can't remember the sound of my own name\rYes and only if my own true love was waiting\rIf I could hear her heart softly pounding\rIf only she was lying by me\rThen I'd lie in my bed once again\rThere's beauty in the silver singing river\rThere's beauty in the sunrise in the sky\rBut none of these and nothing else could match the beauty\rThat I remember in my true love's eyes\rYes and only if my own true love was waiting\rIf I could hear her heart softly pounding\rIf only she was lying by me\rThen I'd lie in my bed once again\rIf today was not an endless highway\rIf tonight was not an endless trail\rIf tomorrow wasn't such a long time\rThen lonesome would mean nothing to me at all\rYes and only if my own true love was waiting\rIf I could hear her heart softly pounding\rIf only she was lying by me\rThen I'd lie in my bed once again",
