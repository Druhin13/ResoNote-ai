I smell pussy\n\nLet me count my guns, um\n\n5,4,3,2,1, run!\n\nHi, my name is Durt Cobain\n\nLike a pimp, here I go 'til the next episode\n\nAin't a nann nigga this XXXplosive, beastcoast shit\n\nBlat-blat, reloaded\n\nFuck them other niggas, ride or die for my niggas\n\nStrictly 4 my niggas, survival of the fittest\n\nWoop-woop! That's the sound of the police\n\nI'm in deep cover, skrt skrt\n\nLean back, give me one more chance\n\nThey say Jesus walks and the Devil wear Prada\n\nBut I'm so, so deaf, God can't tell me nothing\n\nWrite this on my death certificate, I gave you power\n\n21 questions, like who shot ya? I shot ya!\n\nWarning, watch them niggas flashin' lights papparazi\n\nTwo words, fuck bitches, get money\n\nTonight's da night, guess who's back on my block\n\nRather unique, I lick a shot for Bucktown\n\nThis firearm, silencer on, that quiet storm\n\nT-O-N-Y, top of New York, with a pitchfork",
