  "lyrics": "Now, look at that road\r\nLook at that climb\r\nWhen it's throwing in a nickel or get out a dime\r\nToo patterned, too close\r\nToo flattered, too broke\r\nNow look at you go\n\n\n\nTook the morning to float\n\nTook the morning to find\n\nI got a vision of a mission but an awkward vibe\n\nToo livid, too scared\n\nToo loving, too closed\n\nNow look at you know\n\n\n\nWhen the cause is on dead arrival\n\nAnd you coulda shoulda woulda for free\n\nNow look at your post script, every minute\n\nIt's a very slow thing to have glean, ah\n\n\n\nSo maybe you know\n\nOr maybe you don't\n\nIt isn't time for a fitting of a passing cloak\n\nToo forward, too fine\n\nToo patient, too wise\n\nNow look at you shine\n\n\n\nTook the matter to house\n\nToo the matter to mouth\n\nWith the feeling that I'm fishing in a harbor now\n\nToo clever, too kind\n\nToo patterned to hide\n\nNow, look at that smile\n\n\n\nSo when the 'cause ain't dead on arrival\n\nAnd you couldn't shouldn't wouldn't for free\n\nDo not hang your cause on revival\n\n'Cause now looking is bringing you grief\n\nSo when the cause is dead on arrival\n\nAnd you coulda shoulda woulda for free\n\nI wouldn't have forced it on the minute\n\nIt's a very hard thing to have grief\n\n\n\nAh give it a minute, we're dancing in it",
