  "lyrics": "Boy, you're gonna know it all\r\nYou'll think you're ten feet tall\r\nAnd run like you're bulletproof\r\nAnd total a car or two\r\nBoy, you're gonna hate this town\r\nWish you could burn it down\n\nThat fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide\n\nBut boy, you're gonna love 17\n\nAnd boy, you'll do some stupid things\n\n\n\nYou're gonna drive and kiss\n\nAnd throw a punch\n\nAnd grow up way too fast\n\nYou're gonna drop the ball\n\nHit the wall\n\nAnd break some hearts like glass\n\nI know you will, 'cause you're a part of me\n\nAnd a part of you will always be a boy\n\n\n\nBoy, you're gonna be so stubborn\n\nYou get that from your mother\n\nI already see it now, you weren't built for backing down\n\nAnd boy, there'll be a small town night\n\nAnd you'll fall for her sky-blue eyes\n\nAnd when she's in your hands\n\nYou'll think you're a man and not a boy\n\nShe'll make you lose your mind, boy\n\nShe'll be every reason why\n\n\n\nYou're gonna drive and kiss\n\nAnd throw a punch\n\nAnd grow up way too fast\n\nYou're gonna drop the ball\n\nHit the wall\n\nAnd break some hearts like glass\n\nI know you will, 'cause you're a part of me\n\nAnd a part of you will always be...my boy\n\n\n\nIt's 3am and I'd do anything to get you back to sleep\n\nAnd that face will be the same one in the rearview\n\nThe day I watch you leave\n\n\n\nBut boy, you're gonna come back home\n\nYou're gonna settle down\n\nBut you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now\n\nTil you have a boy\n\nHe's gonna know it all\n\nHe'll think he's ten feet tall\n\nAnd run like he's bulletproof\n\nAnd total a car or two",
