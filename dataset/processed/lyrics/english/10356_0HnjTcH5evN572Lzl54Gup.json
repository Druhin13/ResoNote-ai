  "lyrics": "Waitress sets the tables, two and four and six\r\nLaying placemats, knife, fork, spoon upon napkin\r\nAll the counter people, she knows us all by name\r\nA counter people vision, everywhere we are the same\r\nOh and once everything starts to shift\n\nTip the weight that makes this whole thing give\n\nOh but I don't know where to put my hands\n\nAnd the thought of silence makes me sick\n\n\n\nHey, I think it might be getting to me\n\nHey, I think it might be finally getting to me\n\nHey, I think it might be, finally getting to me\n\nHey, I think it might be, finally getting to me\n\n\n\nAll of the pretty people are out here\n\nThe women with their jewels and their long dangling earrings\n\nAnd the men with one hand on the small of her back\n\nThe other casually with his thumb through the belt loop of his waistband\n\n\n\nAnd so you line 'em up\n\nA single cell and another one gone\n\nOstracon vase with your name on the line\n\nAnd so you line 'em up\n\nA single cell and another one gone\n\nOstracon vase with your name on the line\n\n\n\nHey, I think it might be getting to me\n\nHey, I think it might be finally getting to me\n\nHey, I think it might be, finally getting to me\n\nHey, I think it might be, finally getting to me",
