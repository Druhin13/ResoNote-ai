  "lyrics": "Medicated to the point of apathy\r\nEach day another little pill to swallow\r\nDosing those composing hopes, they tear at the seams\r\nAnd embrace it, a sickness bought\r\nBuilding these addictions for the sake of a dollar\r\nDevil's got his hands in all our pockets\n\nClose to broke, alone exposing beyond our means\n\nTill we're vacant from the lie we bought\n\n\n\nI won't be one of your puzzle pieces\n\nForced into fitting\n\nPardon me but there's a part of me\n\nThat feels something's missing\n\nAre we living or are we just dying\n\nIt's time we wage a war really worth fighting\n\nI don't wanna be another puzzle piece\n\nI don't wanna be part of your puzzle\n\n\n\nGlorifying monsters, it sells on TV\n\nIf it bleeds, it reads in papers out tomorrow\n\nWe say we'll pray for change one day but afraid what it means\n\nFace it, we'll take it, no lessons learned\n\nTalking heads addicted to the sound of their voice\n\nThe devil's got us all in his pocket\n\nMistakes we made and this game we played now change everything\n\nWell we fake it, no lesson learned\n\n\n\nI won't be one of your puzzle pieces\n\nForced into fitting\n\nPardon me but there's a part of me\n\nThat feels something's missing\n\nAre we living or are we just dying\n\nIt's time we wage a war really worth fighting\n\nI don't wanna be another puzzle piece\n\nI don't wanna be part of your puzzle\n\n\n\nNo-oh, no-oh, we're gonna find a way\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh, to overcome\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh, we're gonna find a way\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\n\n\n\nI won't be one of your puzzle pieces\n\nForced into fitting\n\nPardon me but there's a part of me\n\nThat feels something's missing\n\nAre we living or are we just dying\n\nIt's time we wage a war really worth fighting\n\nI don't wanna be another puzzle piece\n\nI don't wanna be part of your puzzle\n\n\n\nWe're gonna find some way\n\nTo overcome\n\nTogether we'll find the way",
