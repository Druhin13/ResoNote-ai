  "lyrics": "Does he take your hand\r\nDoes he make you laugh\r\nTell me girl, is it a temporary thing\r\nDoes he play with your hair\r\nWrap you up in his arms\r\nKiss your lips and watch you fall asleep\n\n\n\nYou ain't gotta say it\n\nBut I know that you miss me 'cause\n\n\n\nMy phone still rings with your name on it\n\nYou got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you\n\nYou know he'll never do it like I do\n\nThat's why you send a text at two in the morning\n\nEverybody knows that he's holding you tonight\n\nBut you hold me in the back of your mind\n\n\n\nDid you make a mistake, your little heartbreak\n\nWhat if I said I miss you too\n\nWe can get it together girl, tell him it's over\n\nI'm over missing you\n\n\n\nI ain't gotta say it\n\nWe both know the truth 'cause\n\n\n\nMy phone still rings with your name on it\n\nYou got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you\n\nYou know he'll never do it like I do\n\nThat's why you send a text at two in the morning\n\nEverybody knows that he's holding you tonight\n\nBut you hold me in the back of your mind\n\n\n\nHe might be the safe kind\n\nBut girl he ain't the right guy\n\n\n\nMy phone still rings with your name on it\n\nYou got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you\n\nYou know he'll never do it like I do\n\nThat's why you send a text at two in the morning\n\nEverybody knows that he's holding you tonight\n\nBut you hold me in the back of your mind\n\n\n\nMy phone still rings with your name on it\n\nYou got a picture with him wearing the shirt that I bought you, girl\n\nSending me a text at two in the morning\n\nEverybody knows that he's holding you tonight\n\nBut you hold me in the back of your mind",
