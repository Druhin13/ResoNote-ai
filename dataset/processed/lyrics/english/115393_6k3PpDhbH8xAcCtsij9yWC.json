But we're digging deeper, uncovering the number of unsolved murders in Savannah... Life in prison without the possibility of parole\n\nYoung nigga on some project shit, harder than a project brick\nPack of Newports and Actavis, yeah that's my starter kit\nI put my Glizzy on my hip and flag to my left\nI'd rather be judged by six than carried by twelve\n\nTime in that cell made me realize, niggas don't show real love\nI empty out that jet for what that make me fill that clip up\nRidin' 'behind my kinfolk, shout out Leeky, yeah it's crip love\nI got a couple exes, I ain't gon' lie, I know I still love",
