  "lyrics": "Summer night, drinkin' wine\r\nBy the fire, catchin' up\r\nYou looking good, wish I could\r\nTell you I was over us\r\nI get high every night when I’m all alone\n\n'Cause it helps me forget that I’m feeling low\n\nTold you I was doing fine\n\nBut it's a lie, don't you know\n\nAnd if you want the truth\n\n\n\nI’m still in love with you\n\nNo matter what I do\n\nI’m still in love with you\n\n\n\nTell myself I don’t care\n\nWho you’re with, I’m losin' my mind\n\nI picture you making love to someone else\n\nTell me why\n\n\n\nI get drunk to shut up all these memories\n\nAnd I wake up and they come running back to me\n\nSo have your fun givin' up\n\nI guess you won and I messed up\n\nAnd I'm acting a fool\n\n\n\n'Cause I’m still in love with you\n\nNo matter what I do\n\nI’m still in love with you\n\nTell me you want me, too\n\n(You want me too)\n\n'Cause I’m still in love with you\n\n\n\nAnd it’s killing me\n\nEndlessly, oh\n\nAnd I’m bound to be\n\nSomebody who's helplessly and desperately\n\nStill in love\n\n\n\nI’m still in love with you\n\n(I am still in love)\n\nI’m still in love with you\n\n(With you, only tell me that you love me too)\n\nTell me you want me too\n\nI’m still in love with you",
