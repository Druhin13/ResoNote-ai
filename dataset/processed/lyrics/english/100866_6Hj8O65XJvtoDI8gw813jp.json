  "lyrics": "I surprised her at work today and brought her a red rose\r\nThen for an hour we slipped away and had lunch just for two\r\nNo I didn't get that job today so that new dress will have to wait\r\nAnd though she planned to wear it Sunday she just smiled and said okay\r\nShe knows the rose is for today, my love is for always\n\nAnd a rose is all I can give till better times come our way\n\nShe knows I'll still be needing her long after the petals fade\n\nThe rose is for today, my love is for always\n\n\n\nWhen we're home and the day is done she hugs my neck because she knows I'm down\n\nTalkin' low and lettin' feelings show she says my love is all that counts\n\nBut I want a mansion to shelter her and we'll have it all someday\n\nFor every petal on the red rose I promise you'll have a bouquet\n\n\n\nShe knows the rose is for today, my love is for always\n\nAnd a rose is all I can give till better times come our way\n\nShe knows I'll still be needing her long after the petals fade\n\nThe rose is for today, my love is for always\n\nThe rose is for today, my love is for always",
