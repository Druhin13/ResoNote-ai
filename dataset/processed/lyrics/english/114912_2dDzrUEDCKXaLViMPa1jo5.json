  "lyrics": "I'm feeling happy inside\r\nI've got no reason to hide\r\nI'm a dream girl\r\nI'm never stressing my bills\r\nNobody ever gets killed\r\nIt's the dream world\n\nMy mama's never on coke\n\nThis isn't my way to cope\n\nWashing my mind out with soap\n\n\n\nEverything is just wonderful here in my dreams\n\nHere in my dreams\n\nEvery day is a holiday when you're living inside your dreams\n\nWhy would anyone stay awake after being so sound asleep?\n\nEverything is just wonderful in my dreams\n\n\n\nHe's never messing around\n\nHe's always holding it down\n\nHe's my dream boy\n\nWe bought a house in the clouds, so we can only look down\n\nIt's the dream world\n\nDon't ever worry or care\n\nExpect to pick what to wear\n\nWhy isn't everyone here?\n\n\n\nEverything is just wonderful here in my dreams\n\nHere in my dreams\n\nEvery day is a holiday when you're living inside your dreams\n\nWhy would anyone stay awake after being so sound asleep?\n\nEverything is just wonderful in my dreams\n\n\n\nThe moments we are happiest\n\nHappiest, happiest\n\nAre the moments that we don't exist\n\nDon't exist, don't exist\n\n\n\nEverything is just wonderful here in my dreams\n\nHere in my dreams\n\nEvery day is a holiday when you're living inside your dreams\n\nWhy would anyone stay awake after being so sound asleep?\n\nEverything is just wonderful in my dreams\n\nEverything is just wonderful here in my dreams\n\nHere in my dreams\n\nEvery day is a holiday when you're living inside your dreams\n\nWhy would anyone stay awake after being so sound asleep?\n\nEverything is just wonderful in my dreams",
