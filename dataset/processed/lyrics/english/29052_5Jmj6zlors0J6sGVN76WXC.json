  "lyrics": "Rising up out of the dust\r\nBlack and blue from broken trust\r\nJust because you got me good\r\nDon't mean that it's over, it ain't over, no\r\nWherever you are, that's where I'm gonna find you\n\nAll that you've forgot, that's what I will remind you\n\nA counter attack, tit for tat, back again\n\nNo I'm not your friend, not here to make amends\n\n\n\nEvery scar you left on me I'm gonna make a match\n\nCut you with the dagger that you left in my back\n\nHoney, I ain't even gotten even, so it ain't the end\n\nSweet revenge\n\n\n\nWreck your bed, mess with your head\n\nMake you wish that you were dead\n\nCouple things I mean to do\n\nBefore it's over, it ain't over, no\n\n\n\nWherever you are, that's where I'm gonna find you\n\nAll that you've forgot, that's what I will remind you\n\nA counter attack, tit for tat, back again\n\nNo I'm not your friend, not here to make amends\n\n\n\nEvery scar you left on me I'm gonna make a match\n\nCut you with the dagger that you left in my back\n\nHoney, I ain't even gotten even, so it ain't the end\n\nSweet revenge\n\n\n\nTry to forgive, try to forget\n\nIt still hurts my heart, it still haunts my head\n\nIt makes me smile knowing that you\n\nWill know the hell you put me through\n\n\n\nWherever you are, that's where I'm gonna find you\n\nAll that you've forgot, that's what I will remind you\n\nA counter attack, tit for tat, back again\n\nNo I'm not your friend, not here to make amends\n\n\n\nEvery scar you left on me I'm gonna make a match\n\nCut you with the dagger that you left in my back\n\nHoney, I ain't even gotten even, so it ain't the end\n\nSweet revenge\n\n\n\nJust because you got me good\n\nDon't mean that it's over, it ain't over",
