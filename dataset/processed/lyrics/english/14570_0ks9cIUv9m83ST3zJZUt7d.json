  "lyrics": "We all sold weed for a while\r\nAnd we've all made our mother cry\r\nIt's a habit that I've finally broken at this point in my life\r\nAnd now I'm kinda getting by\r\nBut sometimes it's hard to go outside\r\nAnd I've been driving way too much\n\nI've been too lazy to fix my bike\n\n\n\nNow as long as I close my eyes, I'm by myself\n\nAnd I'd rather be at home with you than anywhere else\n\nAnd now I'm turning onto your street\n\nNow I love you like you never hurt me\n\nThe planet took a real sharp turn\n\nBefore all that space in between\n\n\n\nAnd I really don't agree\n\nThat your merit is buried in your gender normalities\n\nAnd I promise I'll take care of you if you promise to let me\n\nNow as long as I close my eyes, I'm by myself\n\nAnd I'd rather be alone with you than anybody else\n\n\n\nAnd I've never needed god\n\nI think I kinda knew that all along\n\nTo need a promise of heaven\n\nTo do good deeds\n\nAlways seemed inherently wrong\n\n\n\nAnd so I wrote you this song\n\nIt probably isn't as good as all the other sad ones\n\nAnd I'll pass out in your bed\n\nAfter getting too high while you were gone\n\n\n\nLook at me, it was all for you\n\nAnd it's about time that you knew\n\nThat I've loved you since I was 17\n\n\n\nAnd for all the things I've seen\n\nThere's still some wounds that I need to clean\n\nBut let's move far away from here when I finally get my degree\n\nAnd we'll live happily\n\nGet some rescue dogs in a house by the sea\n\nAnd I promise I'll take care of you if you promise to let me",
