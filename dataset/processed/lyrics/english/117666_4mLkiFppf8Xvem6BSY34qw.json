  "lyrics": "There is something between us, I can see it right now\r\nYour magnetic demeanor, that's something can’t be found\r\nI thought that I was dreaming 'til my love came around\r\nNow I just come on over, show you how we get down\r\nShawty, you can get blazed\n\nI can't believe that you are here, I can’t believe it's happening\n\nWhat are the odds that you'd appear?\n\nThe universe so vast to me\n\nSeven billion is on the Earth\n\nCould've been anywhere, but you're here with me\n\nShould I play lotto? What's it worth?\n\nI must be on, so clear to me\n\n\n\nOnce I have you, I will never let you, never let you\n\nOnce I have you, I will never let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you\n\n\n\nThere is something between us, I can see it right now\n\nYour magnetic demeanor, that's something can't be found\n\nI thought that I was dreaming ’til my love came around\n\nNow I just come on over, show you how we get down\n\nShawty, you can get blazed\n\n\n\nLook at you, love, you are the same\n\nYou have a light you cannot hide\n\nYes, you may have a different face\n\nBut your soul is the same inside\n\nI don’t care who is listening\n\n'Cause they be making fun of this on TV\n\nThey wouldn’t laugh if they were inside my past life\n\nWith you and they were me\n\n\n\nOnce I have you, I will never let you, never let you\n\nOnce I have you, I will never let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go, oh\n\nNever let you, never let you go, yeah\n\nNever let you\n\n\n\nDon't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can\n\nShawty, you can get blazed\n\nSleep if you want, and wake up in love again\n\nShawty, you can get blazed\n\n\n\nOnce I have you, I will never let you, never let you\n\nOnce I have you, I will never let you, never let you go\n\n(Shawty you can get blazed)\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you, never let you go\n\nNever let you",
