  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Satellite par Son Volt\r\n\nWhere you comin' from?\nWhere you headed?\nSociety's forecast inclement outcome\nStrange days of melody moving\nDelta blues bucket will keep you healthy\n\n\nThere's pain in your heart\nWorld of false starts\nThere's pain in your heart\n\n\nWe'll find a way\nThrough a satellite\nThrough a satellite\n\nWe'll find a way\n\n\nMoonlight and the night are past\nOrson Welles and Anton Karas\nFlip the switch, but we're already gone\nNothing compared to a world that's bleeding\n\n\nThere's pain in your heart\nFull of false starts\nThere's pain in your heart\n\nWe'll find a way\nThrough a satellite\nThrough a satellite\nWe'll find a way",
