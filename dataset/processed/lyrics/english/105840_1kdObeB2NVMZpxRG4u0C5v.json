  "lyrics": "They carved your name in your neighbor's door, and it's blood on blood\r\nJust making sure that he's the score, but it's blood on blood\r\nWe're gearing up for a holy war, it's either them or us\r\nSo ship 'em off to another shore, but it's still blood on blood\r\nWhere's the world we're dreaming of?\n\nCause I'm waking up\n\nIt's funny how we show our love\n\nOh, we need a better blood on blood\n\n\n\nA novel take on an ancient book, and it's blood on blood\n\nA scimitar or shepherd's crook, it's still blood on blood\n\nThe billy club or the booted foot they buried in your gut\n\nMaybe it's time for another look at all this blood on blood\n\n\n\nWhere's the world we're dreaming of?\n\nCause I'm waking up\n\nIt's funny how we show our love\n\nWe need a better blood on blood\n\n\n\nWe all pretend we're civilized, but it's blood on blood\n\nYou say it's sanctioned and sanitized, but it's blood on blood\n\nDon't have to look in the devil's eyes or see his infant son\n\nJust like a boat from the bluest skies, but it's still blood on blood\n\n\n\nWhere's the world we're dreaming of?\n\nCause I'm waking up\n\nIt's funny how we show our love\n\nWe need a better blood on blood",
