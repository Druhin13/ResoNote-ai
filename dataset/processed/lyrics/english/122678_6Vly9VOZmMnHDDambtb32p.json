  "lyrics": "I raise my voice, you slam the door\r\nI don't let up 'til your hearts on the floor\r\nLosing our minds, scream and we shout\r\n'Til we forget what we fighting about\r\nTurns me into a monster\r\nWe're no good for each other\n\nLying in bed, miles apart\n\nWe're side by side and alone in the dark\n\n\n\nThere's no going back\n\nBack to when things were easy\n\nBut there's something that I'd like to do\n\nRight before you leave me\n\n\n\nIf this really is the end\n\nThen why don't you please come back to bed\n\nCome on and spend the night\n\nAnd let's say our last goodbye\n\nBaby don't walk away\n\nDon't wanna remember you this way\n\nCome on and spend the night\n\nAnd let's say our last goodbye\n\n\n\nI twist the knife, I know it hurts\n\nIt's time to stop boy we both make it worse\n\nTossing and turns, you get no sleep\n\nI speculate on the secrets you keep\n\nTurn him into a monster\n\nWe're no good for each other\n\nWe should be done, both of us know\n\nDeep down the truth is we're better alone\n\n\n\nThere's no going back\n\nBack to when things were easy\n\nBut there's something that I'd like to do\n\nRight before you leave me\n\n\n\nLike we're just crying off a liquor kiss\n\nSpring to these string\n\nForget about the phone when I ring\n\nGrooving at the backseat, move up on me\n\nI will not forget anything\n\nThen we heading up from the guns go wild\n\nIt's been only 50 seconds\n\nI've been all up on you now\n\nIt's so sad to see that we couldn't be all up in the clouds\n\nAnd it's the last time I'll be all up in your mouth (Yeah)\n\n\n\nThere's no going back\n\nBack to when things were easy\n\nBut there's something that I'd like to do\n\nRight before you leave me\n\n\n\nIf this really is the end\n\nThen why don't you please come back to bed\n\nCome on and spend the night\n\nAnd let's say our last goodbye\n\nBaby don't walk away\n\nDon't wanna remember you this way\n\nCome on and spend the night\n\nAnd let's say our last goodbye",
