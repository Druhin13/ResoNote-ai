  "lyrics": "For all the deadbeat dads\r\nAnd the kids that they had\r\nThe ones that's left behind that's always up on their minds\r\nTo know that there's no excuse\r\nTo leave a boy in his youth\n\nAnd now that dirty secret's just some ugly truth\n\n\n\nTo be left all alone\n\nTo never pick up the phone\n\nAnd all the things I learned I guess I learned on my own\n\n\n\nBut what's done has been done\n\nAnd now your only son\n\nWants to share the love with you he got from his mom\n\n\n\nBad boys need love too\n\n[You know who I'm talkin' 'bout]\n\n\n\nI was still just a kid\n\nBarely out of my crib\n\nLeft alone at home yes I was raising my sibs\n\n\n\nWhile my mother got paid\n\nAlways at someone's aid\n\nShe missed us, kissed us, told us she'd be home\n\n\n\nNow her kids is full grown\n\nThey've got kids of their own\n\nPut the past behind you mind you you're never alone\n\n\n\nCause my brothers they're two\n\nYes I got a nephew\n\nCan't change who you are 'til you change what you do\n\n\n\nBad boys need love too\n\n[You know who I'm talkin' 'bout]\n\n\n\n\n\nPull from the earth\n\nEvery last thing of worth\n\nTo know the soil is free of oil, to make that your work\n\n\n\nTo know that we share\n\nThe same water and air\n\nSo can't we be more mindful of what we put in there\n\n\n\nCause we can't be surprised\n\nWhen the oceans do rise\n\nTo tell yourself you'll be okay is to tell yourself lies\n\n\n\nSo let's change how we live\n\nLess take and more give\n\nIt's in my mother's nature now to always forgive\n\n\n\nBad boys need love too\n\n[You know who i'm talkin' 'bout]",
