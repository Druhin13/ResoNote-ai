  "lyrics": "Ain't nothing fancy 'bout how I talk\r\nIt's little bit slow, full of ain't and yaws\r\nSomewhere between some old school straight and McGraw\r\nI know you ain't ever been south of heaven\r\nBut if you give me a red dirt chance I'm betting\r\nThis one red light, two lane guy will grow on you\n\nI can't be California\n\n\n\nBut I can be your pine tree shade in the middle of summer\n\nYour tin roof, rain cover from the thunder\n\nYour back view hallelujah Sunday morning prayer\n\nYeah, I'll be where\n\nYou can go when you know that it's all spinning too fast\n\nSlow kinda road, thirty-five on the dash\n\nThat dot on the map for your heart when you need to slow down\n\nYou'll be my whole world, I'll be your small town\n\n\n\nYou got me up all night like New York City\n\nYou got the Beverly high heels, dressed kinda pretty\n\nAnd every time I get to hold you I get to go there\n\nSo when you want a little bit of middle of nowhere\n\n\n\nBut I can be your pine tree shade in the middle of summer\n\nYour tin roof, rain cover from the thunder\n\nYour back view hallelujah Sunday morning prayer\n\nBaby, I'll be where\n\nYou can go when you know that it's all spinning too fast\n\nSlow kinda road, thirty-five on the dash\n\nThat dot on the map for your heart when you need to slow down\n\nYou'll be my whole world, I'll be your small town\n\nYeah, I'll be your small town\n\n\n\nI'll be your Friday night, misery light midnight sixer\n\nYou be the shooting star, I'll be the wisher\n\nThat back road flying, wind blowing through your hair\n\nI just wanna be where\n\n\n\nYou can go when you know that it's all spinning too fast\n\nSlow kinda road, thirty-five on the dash\n\nThat dot on the map for your heart when you need to slow down\n\nYou'll be my whole world, I'll be your small town\n\nGirl, you'll be my whole world\n\nAnd I'll be your small town",
