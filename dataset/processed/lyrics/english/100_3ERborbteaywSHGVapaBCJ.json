  "lyrics": "I listen back to the confines I set within myself\r\nThe words fell on deaf ears in their own little hell\r\nI heard the loss reverb, all around your voice\r\nThe kind of space that holds the room, leaves me little choice\r\nWe'll say what we want\n\nWe'll say what we want\n\nI'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side\n\nWe're willingly lost\n\nWe're willingly lost\n\nI'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is\n\n\n\nWe'll chalk it up to blind luck, metaphors, or doubt\n\nAfter years of searching, it's almost working out\n\nIf you don't like the format you set the music to\n\nYou can change the rhythm you choose to feel it through\n\n\n\nWe'll say what we want\n\nWe'll say what we want\n\nI'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side\n\nWe're willingly lost\n\nWe're willingly lost\n\nI'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign for what it is\n\n\n\nI might be pointing too close to that flame\n\nI'll dip the [?] to push the water away\n\nIn between 2 different worlds, fall apart\n\nWe swim, cycling through the dark and carry on [?]\n\n\n\nWe'll say what we want\n\n(We'll say what we want)\n\nWe'll say what we want\n\n(We'll say what we want)\n\nI'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced we'll see the other side\n\nWe're willingly lost\n\n(We're willingly lost)\n\nWe're willingly lost\n\n(We're willingly lost)\n\nI'm learning to take a hint, stay convinced that we might see a sign",
