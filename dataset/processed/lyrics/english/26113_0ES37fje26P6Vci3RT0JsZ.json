  "lyrics": "The other day I found myself up on the corner\r\nI thought I run into a friend of mine\r\nEnded up that he was just a stranger\r\nI said hello as he passed me by\r\nBut then he turned and put a gun to my head\n\nHe said, My friend I'm going to rob you blind\n\nI said You must be down on your luck\n\nI'm out of money and I'm all out of time\n\n\n\nHe pulled the trigger and I fell to my knees\n\nMy spirit left and then my body went cold\n\nI'm looking down upon the lights of the city\n\nI feel alive, but I'm dead and gone\n\n\n\nAin't no more walking down the side of the road\n\nAin't no more sleeping on the edge of a frown\n\nAin't no more favors from someone I don't know\n\ncause there ain't nobody hear me, there ain't nobody around\n\n\n\nHallelujah, coming home\n\nHallelujah, hes dead and gone\n\nHallelujah, somethings wrong\n\nHallelujah\n\n\n\nSo tell me now if your singing can bring me\n\nAnother day with my feet on the ground\n\nI miss living and living misses me\n\nI miss it so much that im holding me down\n\n\n\nFor all the things that I never could change\n\nFor all the reasons that I never understood why\n\n\n\nI feel alone, baby\n\nI'm dead and gone, baby\n\nThere's somethings wrong\n\ncause you know I still feel alive\n\n\n\nMy train is rolling down the line\n\nnd I'm waiting till it to bring me a dream\n\nfor holding you up in my eyes\n\noh feel my love, honey\n\nfrom up above, honey\n\nOh don't give up on me cause im coming down\n\n\n\nI'm not a one nighter\n\nI'm not a flat liner\n\nI've everything in between the harmony you're singing loud\n\n\n\nHallelujah, coming home\n\nHallelujah, its dead and gone\n\nHallelujah, somethings wrong\n\nHallelujah, its just a song\n\n\n\nThe other day I found myself up on the corner\n\nI thought I run into a friend of mine",
