  "lyrics": "I put spots on a bird of paradise, snake eyes on a domino\r\nWhen the bird devours the flower then you know\r\nBlow on the fire ashes blow away\r\nBlow on the fire ashes blow away\r\nTwisted branch of an aging sycamore\n\nSpider veins across its leaves\n\nOnce I stood in its shadow, watched the fire breathe\n\n\n\nBlow on the fire ashes blow away\n\nBlow on the fire ashes blow away, ashes blow away",
