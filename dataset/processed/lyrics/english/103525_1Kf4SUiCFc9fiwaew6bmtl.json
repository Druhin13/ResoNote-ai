  "lyrics": "Come to my city though\r\nTalk to me nice bitch or don't talk to me twice\r\nGoodbye\r\nDreamdoll\r\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that\n\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that\n\n\n\nAss fat, they like \"Damn what is that?\" (What is that)\n\nBlack cars, pushing pieces to the max\n\nWe in Barneys, we in Neiman, we in Saks\n\nAt the game, courtside, where you at? (where you at?)\n\nMy diamonds clear, chandelier, you can stare\n\nSaid you getting all this money, bitch where?\n\nBitches faking just to make it\n\nHad to glow up just to take it\n\nKeep it a hundred in change\n\nI spent a buck on a range\n\nDripping a watch and a chain\n\nSkrt, you're not in my lane\n\nBitches hating, I ain't got no patience\n\nI be waiting, send your location\n\n\n\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that\n\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that\n\n\n\nI be everywhere, you keep it local (local)\n\nYou got a problem, I will approach you\n\nYou wanna solve then keep it vocal\n\nWe in the mix, I ain't talking produce\n\nDon't turn me on I ain't got an off switch\n\nI take it easy ain't gotta call sick\n\nI'm a boss bitch, step in my office\n\nYou a soft bitch, you only talk shit\n\n\n\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that\n\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that\n\nI'm on the block, pull up\n\nSkrt skrt, where you at? (Where you at?)\n\nYou a kid bitch, I sit you on my lap (on my lap)\n\nThrowing subs, bitch get off the internet (internet)\n\nTalking tough, we was never into that",
