  "lyrics": "My heart is on the ground (On the ground)\r\nIt's been there for too long (Too long, too long)\r\nCheap words slip through my mouth (Through my mouth)\r\nI'd rather show you that I can be strong\r\nOh, I think I want to go home where I belong (I belong)\n\nSingin', moon river movin' west on the 84\n\nDeath be callin' my name since the day I was born\n\nOnly this time, I'm not afraid anymore\n\n\n\nI been running like the wind, packing up again\n\nSingin' like my life depends on it\n\nYeah I'm running like the wind, never settled in\n\nFunny how my life depends on it\n\n'Cause my heart beat's from the ground, ooh\n\nYou can listen if you learn my song\n\n(You can listen, you can listen if you learn my song)\n\n\n\nI think I want to go home where I belong (I belong)\n\nSingin', good vibrations movin' south down the 101\n\nDeath be callin' my name since the day I was born\n\nOnly this time, I'm not afraid anymore\n\n\n\nI think I wanna go home\n\nWhere the trees get tall lookin' out from my bedroom window\n\nWanna go home\n\nWhere my dad works hard and my mom is a hero\n\nI wanna go home\n\nBack to pick up games and anything playing on the radio\n\nWhere do I go?\n\nWhere do I go?\n\n\n\nI think I want to go\n\nI would laugh in the cul-de-sac where I learned to skate\n\nI wanna go\n\nPlaying air guitar by the lake and there were no mistakes\n\nNo mistakes",
