  "lyrics": "And when I asked for a separate room\r\nIt was late at night, and we'd been driving since noon\r\nBut if I'd known how that would sound to you\r\nI would have stayed in your bed for the rest of my life\r\nJust to prove I was right\r\nThat it's harder to be friends than lovers\n\nAnd you shouldn't try to mix the two\n\n'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy\n\nThen you know that the problem is you\n\nAnd it's true that I stole your lighter\n\nAnd it's also true that I lost the map\n\nBut when you said that I wasn't worth talking to\n\nI had to take your word on that\n\nBut if you'd known how that would sound to me\n\nYou would have taken it back\n\nAnd boxed it up and buried it in the ground\n\nBoxed it up and buried it in the ground\n\nBoxed it up and buried it in the ground\n\nBurned it up and thrown it away\n\nYou put in my hands a loaded gun\n\nAnd then told me not to fire it\n\nWhen you did the things you said were up to me\n\nAnd then accused me of trying to fuck it up\n\nBut you've never been a waste of my time\n\nIt's never been a drag\n\nSo take a deep breath and count back from ten\n\nAnd maybe you'll be alright\n\nAnd the license said you had to stick around until I was dead\n\nBut if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am\n\nBut you've never been a waste of my time\n\nIt's never been a drag\n\nSo take a deep breath and count back from ten\n\nAnd maybe you'll be alright",
