  "lyrics": "It's only been three weeks\r\nAnd a bag of speed from Jamie the PhD\r\nShe comes by the front desk\r\nTo leave my transcript with her edits\r\nCause I don't wanna leave the palace\n\nAt least that's what my true love calls it\n\nLast night I wrote a poem\n\nMan, I must have been in the poem zone\n\nI'm in over my head\n\nI'm in over my head\n\n\n\nMaybe I'll get a pet\n\nLearn how to take care of somebody else\n\nMaybe I'll name him Jeff\n\nBut I think it might defeat the purpose\n\nLiving on house keeping and room service\n\n\n\nBut I don't wanna leave the palace\n\nLet's pay someone to move in and fix this\n\nLast night I texted your iPhone\n\nAnd said I'm ready to come home\n\nI'm in over my head\n\nI'm in over my head\n\nI'm way in over my head",
