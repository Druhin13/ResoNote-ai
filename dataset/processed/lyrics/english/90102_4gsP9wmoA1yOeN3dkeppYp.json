  "lyrics": "The sun comes up alone\r\nLike a funeral for my home\r\nLike a mirror for my soul\r\nBut I should've known better\r\nI was feeling like skin and bones\r\nI kept chasing after these ghost\n\nI kept giving up these hopes\n\nWhen I found your letter\n\n\n\nI am Yours and Yours alone\n\nForgive me for my wandering on my own\n\nI’m a prodigal soul\n\nAnd I want to come home\n\nI can’t make it alone\n\nWon’t you bring me home\n\n\n\nTried to start on something new\n\nTried to blame myself on you\n\nBut my nightmares all came true\n\nI felt so unsteady\n\nI still see your face when I close my eyes and\n\nI think about you wide awake at night and\n\nHow far do I have to go to realize\n\nWhat I know already\n\n\n\nI am Yours and Yours alone\n\nForgive me for my wandering on my own\n\nI’m a prodigal soul\n\nI was running on empty\n\nI was feeling so low\n\nWhen you made me a promise\n\nTo never let me go\n\nI was falling to pieces\n\nWhen you carried me home\n\nWhen you told me you loved me\n\nAnd my prodigal soul\n\nIn my dreams all is forgiven\n\nIn my dreams I’m by your side\n\nBut when I wake up somethings missing\n\nCan you free me from my prodigal soul\n\nWon’t you bring me home",
