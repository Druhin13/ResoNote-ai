  "lyrics": "Come on down from that cloud\r\nAnd cast your fears aside\r\nYou're all here and there\r\nAnd there's nothing inside\n\nMay God's will be done\n\nIn these poisoned hills\n\n\n\nAnd let the devil be cast out on his jail\n\nHey!\n\n\n\nThere was a voice that called me\n\nThere was a light that burned me\n\n\n\nCome on and let's be sure\n\nLet's not pave the way\n\n\n\nYour friends have died\n\nAnd their lives, they just fade away\n\n\n\nSome worked the hills\n\nSome worked in factories\n\nWorked their lives away\n\n\n\nAnd in time, you will see your own life fade away\n\n\n\nThere was no time to go back\n\nThere was no time to go back\n\nCome on!\n\n\n\nThey were in hills\n\nThey were in factories\n\nThey are in graves now\n\n\n\nThey were in debt to themselves\n\nAnd what is it made of now?\n\n\n\nI go around and feel how it fades\n\nI walk around and I see what's fading\n\nWalk around and you'll see how it fades\n\nWalk around and you'll see what's faded",
