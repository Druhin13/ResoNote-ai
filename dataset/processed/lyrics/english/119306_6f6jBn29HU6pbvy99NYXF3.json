  "lyrics": "Take that ribbon from your hair\r\nShake it loose and let it fall\r\nLay it soft against your skin\r\nLike the shadow on the wall\r\nCome and lay down by my side\n\nTill the early morning light\n\nAll I'm takin' is your time\n\nHelp me make it through the night\n\n\n\nI don't care who's right or wrong\n\nI won't try to understand\n\nLet the devil take tomorrow\n\nLord, tonight I need a friend\n\n\n\nYesterday is dead and gone\n\nAnd tomorrow's out of sight\n\nAnd it's sad to be alone\n\nHelp me make it through the night\n\n\n\nI don't care who's right or wrong\n\nI won't try to understand\n\nLet the devil take tomorrow\n\nLord, tonight I need a friend\n\n\n\nYesterday is dead and gone\n\nBut tomorrow's out of sight\n\nAnd it's sad to be alone\n\nHelp me make it through the night\n\nI don't want to be alone\n\nHelp me make it through the night\n\nYou don't have to be alone\n\nI'll help you make it through the night",
