  "lyrics": "504 black girl carried me\r\nIn her womb to the land of the peach\r\nHer birthing pains brought me low\r\nBut she held me high on Peachtree road\r\nGot my mother’s eyes and my father’s nose\r\nAlso got brother's hand-me-down clothes\n\nWe had no green but the love was strong\n\nIt was all we’d need to get us along, get us along\n\n\n\nLeft ATL for the Texas way\n\nWe drove 20 East in my daddy's '88\n\nI learned in school I didn't measure up\n\nI fell short of what true blackness was\n\nMama taught the righteous way\n\nI set down that path but went astray\n\nPaid for love on a crescent moon\n\nIn that Oklahoma motel room\n\nKyree taught me chords to strum\n\nThey got me through when I felt numb\n\n\n\n504 black girl\n\n504 black girl carried me\n\n504 black girl, black girl\n\n504 black girl carried me\n\n504 black girl carried me\n\n504 black girl carried me",
