  "lyrics": "All of my friends are the reason I’m only\r\nOn for the weekend when it’s not so lonely\r\nMost Friday nights end up looking this way\r\nWake up so high, now I’m drunk on the feeling\r\nBoredom comes next and I stare at the ceiling\r\nMost Monday nights end up looking this way\n\nEnd up looking this way\n\n\n\nCome on sugar, don’t you leave early\n\nI’m tired of counting myself back to sleep\n\n\n\nBaby, we don’t need no money\n\nNo worries tonight\n\nStart a party in the living room\n\nTurn it up until we feel it boom\n\nBaby, let’s get fucking crazy and lose track of time\n\nWhy we always got to fret about it?\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\n\n\nMy friends are the reason that I’m never sober\n\nYoung and I’m broke and I live on a sofa\n\nWhen it gets hard, yeah we get drunk again\n\nWe get wild, we let down\n\nYeah we’re foolish and scared\n\nWe run and we jump when we feel unprepared\n\nBut I got your back if you make a mistake, if you make a mistake\n\n\n\nCome on sugar, don’t you leave early\n\nI’m tired of counting myself back to sleep\n\n\n\nBaby, we don’t need no money\n\nNo worries tonight\n\nStart a party in the living room\n\nTurn it up until we feel it boom\n\nBaby, let’s get fucking crazy and lose track of time\n\nWhy we always got to fret about it?\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\n(There’s nothing to regret about it)\n\n\n\nCome on sugar, don’t you leave early\n\n(There’s nothing to regret about it)\n\nI’m tired of counting myself back to sleep\n\n\n\nBaby, we don’t need no money\n\nNo worries tonight\n\nStart a party in the living room\n\nTurn it up until we feel it boom\n\nBaby, let’s get fucking crazy and lose track of time\n\nWhy we always got to fret about it?\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it\n\nThere’s nothing to regret about it",
