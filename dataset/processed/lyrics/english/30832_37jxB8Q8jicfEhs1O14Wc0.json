  "lyrics": "Waiting in the garden, the winner's late\r\nIt's heating up again on the fire escape\r\nAll the dirty money follow the trail\r\nFalling too deep and no turning back\r\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this place\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this place\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this place\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this....\n\nBack to this place\n\n\n\nCould be scars seen from above\n\nIt's not a window you're jumping out of\n\nThen the oil spills to the satellites\n\nDriven to disaster and you're closing your eyes\n\nTake a look at your watch, take a look at the mask\n\nMaking a clean sweep of the future, present and past\n\n\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this place\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this place\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this place\n\nIn another time, in another space\n\nIn another way, we'll get back to this....\n\nBack to this place\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another, in another, in another, in another...\n\nIn another... get back to this...",
