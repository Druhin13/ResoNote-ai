  "lyrics": "I've seen people holding on to nothing\r\nBroken dreams and broken cords\r\nRunning on empty, losing sleep, oh\r\nIt's true I've earned these cracks upon my feet\r\nWalk away from all that you know\n\nWalk away and hold your own\n\nWalk away and hold your own\n\n\n\nAnd I've seen people holding on to something\n\nSmiling with no place to call home\n\nIn you I see something so familiar, uh\n\nMy dear friend, so nice to have you home\n\n\n\nAnd this all seems unreal\n\nJust how far we've come\n\nLook into the mirror\n\nNot sure who I was\n\n\n\nWalk away from all that you know\n\nWalk away and hold your own\n\nWalk away from all that you know\n\nWalk away and hold your own\n\n\n\nWhen you bow your head and wonder\n\nTell me now, will it all become real\n\nFill me in as I sometimes sit and wonder\n\nWonder how you may ever find your feet\n\n\n\nWalk away\n\nI've seen you holding on to nothing\n\nWalk away\n\nI've seen you holding on to something\n\nWalk away from all that you know\n\nI've seen you holding on to nothing\n\nWalk away and hold your own\n\nI've seen you holding on to something\n\nWalk away and hold your own\n\nAnd I've seen people holding on to something",
