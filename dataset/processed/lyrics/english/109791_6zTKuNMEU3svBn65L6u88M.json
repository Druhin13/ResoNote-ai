No, no\n\n\n\nMaybe we should talk about us?\n\n'Cause everybody's talking about us (I wanna know)\n\nSeems like you just wanna give up\n\nFeel we haven't given enough\n\nBlame it on the distance\n\nNo excuse for being distant\n\nTell me, why do you just wanna give up?\n\nFeel we haven't given enough\n\n\n\nGet rid of the bad vibrations, baby (baby)\n\nCan you just admit that you were wrong? (You were wrong)\n\nGet rid of those bad vibrations, baby (baby)\n\nWhy you gotta be so fucking cold? (Fucking cold)\n\nYou're giving me bad, bad, bad vibrations\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations\n\n\n\nBeing childish, admit it\n\nRubbing me the wrong way\n\nCall me shit, then regret it\n\nYou gotta meet me halfway\n\nI don't know, I don't know, not a damn thing\n\nI don't know, I don't know what you want, babe\n\nWhen did we become strangers? (Oh)\n\n\n\nMaybe we should talk about us?\n\n'Cause everybody's talking about us (I wanna know)\n\nSeems like you just wanna give up (wanna give up)\n\nFeel we haven't given enough (oh-oh)\n\nBlame it on the distance\n\nNo excuse for being distant\n\nTell me, why do you just wanna give up?\n\nFeel we haven't given enough\n\n\n\nGet rid of the bad vibrations, baby (oh-no-no)\n\nCan you just admit that you were wrong? (Admit that I was wrong)\n\nGet rid of those bad vibrations, baby (baby)\n\nWhy you gotta be so fucking cold? (Be so fucking cold)\n\nYou're giving me bad, bad, bad vibrations (oh-oh)\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations (well, you're giving me)\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations (no, oh-oh, no)\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations (hey)\n\n\n\nMaybe we should talk about us?\n\n'Cause everybody's talking about us (I wanna know)\n\nSeems like you just wanna give up\n\nFeel we haven't given enough\n\n\n\nGet rid of the bad vibrations, baby (baby)\n\nCan you just admit that you were wrong? (You were wrong)\n\nGet rid of those bad vibrations, baby (baby)\n\nWhy you gotta be so fucking cold? (Why you gotta be)\n\nYou're giving me bad, bad (bad vibrations), bad vibrations\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations (You're giving me bad vibrations)\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations (oh, no-no-no-no)\n\nBad, bad, bad vibrations",
