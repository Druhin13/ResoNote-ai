  "lyrics": "Oh my heart, it's a fish out of water.\r\nOh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks \nand it bakes in the bad sun.\r\nOh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter.\r\nOh my heart, it's a rocking grey boulder \nand stuck in the gutter.\n\n\n\nAnd I throw my heart back to the ocean,\n\nbut it don't go far, it come back floating\n\nand I watch it wash up with the bad fish\n\nbut it ain't quite dead, it just is lifeless.\n\n\n\nOh my heart, it's a house in tornado.\n\nOh my heart, it's a house in the sky \n\nin the eye of tornado.\n\nOh my heart, it's a roof in El Niño.\n\nOh my heart, it's a roof made of straw \n\nin the jaw of El Niño.\n\n\n\nAnd I pour my heart a new foundation\n\nBut it don't set hard it just is shaking.\n\nAnd I scratch my name, I scratch my name in.\n\nBut it don't set hard it gets mixed back in.\n\n\n\nBuhm buhm buhm buhm...\n\n\n\nOh my heart, it's a fish out of water.\n\nOh my heart, it's a rock in the gutter.\n\n\n\nOh my heart, it's a black in a rainbow.\n\nOh my heart, it's so damn cold, so damn cold.\n\n\n\nAnd I throw my heart into the fire\n\n'cause I want to set my heart on fire\n\nand I watch it try befriending embers\n\nbut the ice don't melt in mid-December.\n\n\n\nOh my heart, it's a fish out of water.\n\nOh my heart, it's a fish on the rocks \n\nand it bakes in the bad sun\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Lea for these lyrics and to industrial33, smithsunknown and skyerain for corrections)",
