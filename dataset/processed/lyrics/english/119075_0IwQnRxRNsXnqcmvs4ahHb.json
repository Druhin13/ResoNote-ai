  "lyrics": "I've been talking to the voice in my head, making me second guess\r\nMaking me think I'm not good enough, making me think I'm not like the rest\r\nI got everything that I wanted, but lately I'm feeling so empty\r\nI never would think about stopping, but lately it's feeling so tempting\r\nDrowning in all of my fear, drowning in all of my problems\r\nEveryone thinking I'm perfect, really I think that I'm falling\n\nI know I got millions of plays, but wonder if music my calling\n\nBut I've been working too long, now I just feel like I'm all in\n\nGotta wait it out, gotta make it out, going through phases\n\nMy anger, I take it out all on my bank account, spending like crazy\n\nNobody told me that it would all end up just being this way\n\nI'm keeping my head up, I know that I'm gonna see better days\n\n\n\nRight place, right time, but I'm not fine\n\nI just hold it all in my mind\n\nI know one day that I'ma shine\n\nBut 'til then I feel like I'm on my own\n\nFeeling like I'm on my own\n\nFeeling like I'm all alone\n\nWaiting 'til that feeling gone\n\nBut I've been waiting way too long\n\nGot what I wanted, but I need something\n\nEvery night just to slow my mind\n\nFeeling like I'm on my own\n\nFeeling like I'm all alone\n\n\n\nI know that it's bigger than me, know that they checking on me\n\nWhen they be going through struggles I know that they listen to me\n\nTryna help 'em hold it all together when they falling apart\n\nI'm thinking way back to the start\n\nThe reason I got into music and all that I wanted\n\nWas helping out people and keeping it honest\n\nI can't let it go, can't let it stop me no more\n\nBuilt it all up from the floor\n\nThey gon' talk about me when I'm gone\n\nI can't leave 'em all without giving 'em more\n\nWhat they gonna think about me if I settle down\n\nAnd never finish giving my story\n\nI don't wanna look back in time\n\nThinking 'bout the shine that was meant to be for me\n\nGotta get it while I can\n\nI gotta stick to the plan\n\nI gotta help out my fam\n\nI got a lot on my shoulders\n\nBut it can't be changing the man that I am\n\nKnow that I'm meant to do bigger things\n\nOn a bigger level living bigger dreams\n\nHard times but I gotta grind\n\n'Til the day I die I'm making history\n\n\n\nRight place, right time, but I'm not fine\n\nI just hold it all in my mind\n\nI know one day that I'ma shine\n\nBut 'til then I feel like I'm on my own\n\nFeeling like I'm on my own\n\nFeeling like I'm all alone\n\nWaiting 'til that feeling gone\n\nBut I've been waiting way too long\n\nGot what I wanted, but I need something\n\nEvery night just to slow my mind\n\nFeeling like I'm on my own\n\nFeeling like I'm all alone",
