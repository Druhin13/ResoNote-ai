  "lyrics": "I see it now\r\nSee your [?] form a sun in your eyes\r\nSee it in the light\r\nA thousand nights\r\nChased away by the bright\r\nBy the brightest eye\n\nHow I've been waiting for it\n\n\n\nI'm in the mood\n\nNever felt this good\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nMoving like I should\n\n\n\nMy friends were right\n\nI've been trying to say it out loud\n\nNow the secret's out\n\nAnd I will never shut my mouth about it\n\n\n\nI'm in the mood\n\nNever felt this good\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nMoving like I should\n\n\n\nAll my friends were right, I just needed time\n\nNever thought I could ever feel this good\n\n\n\nEmotions, I'm drowning in the rain\n\nBig oceans\n\nEasily, we're swept away\n\nI'm in the mood\n\nI've never felt this good\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nMoving like I should\n\n\n\nAll my friends were right, I just needed time\n\nNever thought I could ever feel this good\n\n\n\nAll my friends were right, I just needed time\n\nWhen I'm with you\n\nMoving like I should",
