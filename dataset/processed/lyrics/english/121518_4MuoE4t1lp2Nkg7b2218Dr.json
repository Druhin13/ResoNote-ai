  "lyrics": "I believe in you and in our hearts we know the truth\r\nI believe in love and the darker it gets, the more I do\r\nTry and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light\r\nAnd the days will become endless and never, and never turn to night\r\nAnd never, and never turn to night\n\nThen it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough\n\nA hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here\n\nAnd lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly\n\nGive me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly\n\n\n\nWe have no need to fight\n\nWe raise our voices and let our hearts take flight\n\nGet higher than those planes can fly\n\nWhere the stars do not take sides\n\n\n\nThen it's just too much, I cannot get you close enough\n\nA hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here\n\nAnd lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly\n\nGive me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly\n\n\n\nAnd then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood\n\nA hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here\n\nAnd lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly\n\nGive me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly\n\n\n\nI let him sleep, and as he does\n\nMy held breath fills the room with love\n\nHe hurts in ways I can't describe\n\nMy heart bends and breaks so many, many times\n\nAnd is born again with each sunrise\n\nAnd is born again with each sunrise\n\n\n\n\n\nFunerals were held all over the city\n\nFor you to bleed into the square\n\nAnd women raged as old men fumbled and cried\n\nSorry, we thought you didn't care\n\nBut how does it feel now you can scratch that itch?\n\nHow does it feel?\n\nPulled out all your stitches\n\nHubris is a bitch\n\n\n\nA hundred arms, a hundred years\n\nA hundred arms, a hundred years\n\n\n\nAnd then it's just too much, the streets, they still run with blood\n\nA hundred arms, a hundred years, you can always find me here\n\nAnd lord, don't let me break this, let me hold you lightly\n\nGive me arms to pray with instead of ones that hold too tightly\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh",
