  "lyrics": "Well, he comes in here on the first and fifteenth\r\nPockets just jingling like a tambourine\r\nMakes a beeline over to that old jukebox\r\nFills it up to the top and the needle drops\r\nAnd it's off like a rocket in a neon haze\n\nSpinning 'em back to the good old days\n\nBeer gets to flowing and the whiskey pours\n\nThere ain't an empty spot on the old dance floor\n\nAll cowboy hats, boots and jeans\n\nRiding that honky tonk time machine\n\n\n\nHe's gonna make damn sure the jukebox don't rock\n\nAnd the record's gonna be the only thing that bops\n\nHe's an old-school cold longneck DJ\n\nAnd look at him now, here comes them old green snakes\n\n\n\nAnd it's off like a rocket in a neon haze\n\nSpinning 'em back to the good old days\n\nBeer gets to flowing and the whiskey pours\n\nThere ain't an empty spot on the old dance floor\n\nAll cowboy hats, boots and jeans\n\nRiding that honky tonk time machine\n\n\n\nFrom A to Z and everything between\n\nHe's flying that honky tonk time machine\n\n\n\nAnd it's off like a rocket in a neon haze\n\nSpinning 'em back to the good old days\n\nBeer gets to flowing and the whiskey pours\n\nThere ain't an empty spot on the old dance floor\n\nAll cowboy hats, boots and jeans\n\nRiding that honky tonk time machine\n\nEverybody's back in MWZ\n\nThey're riding that honky tonk time machine\n\n\n\nWell, he comes in here on the first and fifteenth\n\nPockets just jingling like a tambourine\n\nMakes a beeline over to that old jukebox\n\nFills it up to the top and the needle drops",
