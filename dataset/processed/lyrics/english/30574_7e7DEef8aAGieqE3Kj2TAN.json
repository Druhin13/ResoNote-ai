  "lyrics": "I'll pray for you, I'll pray for me, I'll pray for us\r\nI see the light break through clouds , pieces of hope from up above\r\nI know right now you're feeling the same way\r\nSo break down those walls and just come home to me\r\nCome home to me\n\nI'm alone again\n\nWishing you would call and make this end\n\nI don't know where we began\n\nBut I assure you it's not over yet\n\nWhere we began\n\n\n\nI remember when you said it's just a phase\n\nBoys will be boys , girls will be girls\n\nI guess some things don't ever change\n\nI whisper something to just start a fight\n\nI know you're never lonely\n\nBut please just spend the night\n\nJust spend the night\n\n\n\nI'm alone again\n\nWishing you would call and make this end\n\nI don't know where we began\n\nBut I assure you it's not over yet\n\nWhere we began\n\n\n\nAnd I'm not sure where all this started\n\nSo excuse the dear departed\n\n\n\nAnd I'm not sure where all this started\n\nSo excuse the dear departed\n\nCause Their the ones who I think\n\nHarbored my new loneliness\n\nMy new loneliness\n\n\n\nI'm alone again\n\nWishing you would call and make this end\n\nI don't know where we began\n\nBut I assure you it's not over yet\n\nWhere we began",
