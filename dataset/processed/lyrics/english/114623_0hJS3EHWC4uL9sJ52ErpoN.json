  "lyrics": "I got some radio wires soldered to my heart\r\nYou're the only thing that's coming in\r\nI'm getting static from my better sense\r\nNothing on the FM\r\nSee, I've been praying for a signal\r\nA sign that you haven't sent\n\nYou might be an angel falling from the Heavens\n\nOr a stranger from a garden party drunk and roaming ever since\n\n\n\nI've got a Radio Heart and you're the only thing that's coming in\n\nStatic from my better sense\n\nStagnant on my betterment\n\nI'm praying for signal or a sign that you haven't sent\n\nRunning from a place where they don't make people like me\n\nI keep the car running\n\nI keep my bags packed\n\nI don't wanna leave, just don't wanna leave last\n\nI've been praying for your touch, your glance, your hand\n\n\n\nAnd he's a better kisser than you'd think, Mom\n\nHe's a better listener than most\n\nWe took pretty pictures by the sea, Mom\n\nFell in love and sailed off\n\nAnd when the Son of Man had me in his clutches\n\nThe Son of Man had me in his clutches\n\nThe Son of Man had me in his clutches\n\nThe sons of men pulled me to the touch and I loved it\n\n\n\nI hate you more than I miss you\n\nThat's not true, I'd hate to miss you\n\nAnywhere I go anywhere you've been before\n\nI get the chance to say goodbye\n\nOr hello I mean\n\nYou don't call\n\nYou don't write\n\nYou know I've been up for forty days and forty nights and all my fears have multiplied\n\nBy the silence in your eyes\n\n\n\nDoes he stay for the way for the air you're movin\n\nYou're movin\n\nDoes he stay for the way for the air you're movin\n\nYou're losing it\n\n\n\nBetter Hide your love, Hide your love\n\nDon't let it slip away, don't let it slip away\n\nYou better Hide your love\n\nHide your love\n\nDon't let it slip away\n\nDon't let it slip away\n\nYou better Hide your love\n\nSay Hide your love\n\nNow now Hide your love\n\nHide your love",
