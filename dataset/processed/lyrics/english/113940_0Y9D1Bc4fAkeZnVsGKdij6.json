  "lyrics": "Here I am\r\nTorn into a thousand shapes and folds\r\nTorn into a thousand ruins, I know\r\nFornicate inside your broken arms\r\nBefore I grow a smile your way, no more\n\nI can't tell\n\nIf all my answers correlate at all\n\nI'm telling you a thousand things, I know\n\n\n\nI've been missing a long time\n\nTo know I had to move\n\nI've been waiting my whole life\n\nTo know I wanted you\n\nAre you feeling me slowly?\n\nYou can take your fucking time\n\nAnd I promise I won't lie\n\nWe'll make it out alive\n\n\n\nI'm on trial\n\nI'm not so good at hiding lonesome truths\n\nYou see it on my face when I turn blue\n\nSo punish me, I'm hanging on your noose\n\nSo pull me up so I can breathe with you\n\n\n\nI've been missing a long time\n\nTo know I wouldn't move\n\nI've been waiting my whole life\n\nTo know I wanted you\n\nAre you feeling me slowly?\n\nYou can take your fucking time\n\nAnd I promise I won't lie\n\nWe'll make it out alive",
