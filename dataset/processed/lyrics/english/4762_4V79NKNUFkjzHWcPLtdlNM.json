  "lyrics": "Well, you're still walkin' around the block\r\nYou had a long time to think who you are\r\nYou look so sad\r\nWell, so you think\r\nYou say come over\r\nAnd you're still a star\r\nYou're like a villain\r\nIn some old film\r\nWalkin' in the dark\r\nIn somebody's room\r\nSave me\r\n'Cause I'm still sinking\r\nYou've got a harbor\r\nClose to the shore\n\nSimple\r\nYour thoughts are swimming\r\nI'd like to see them\r\nWhen you're alone\r\nâ™ª\r\nYou've got the same smile\r\nYou had before\r\nIt's just laying down\r\nThan what I adore\r\nSave me\r\n'Cause I'm still sinking\r\nWe've got a heartburn\r\nClose to the shore",
