  "lyrics": "Head under water. Heart-blind with love ‘cause the sins that wash away look a bit like blood. Goddamn this reverend baptizing me. Goddamn this reverend, like he did me. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the heels and drags you underneath. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the heels and drags you underneath. He says I’m wanted, for God had a son, and the Devil…he’s jealous, now he wants one. Right hand for the Bible. Left hand for the gun. Goddamn this reverend, he caught the Devil’s son. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the heels and drags you underneath. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the heels and drags you underneath. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the feet. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who pulls you underneath. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the feet. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the heels and drags you underneath. Preach it, preacher. Preach it sweet. Preach it for the Devil who has got you by the heels and drags you underneath.",
