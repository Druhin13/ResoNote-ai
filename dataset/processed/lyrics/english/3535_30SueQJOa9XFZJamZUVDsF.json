  "lyrics": "All rise for the Honorable Judge Burrell\r\nThis court is called to order\r\nThese charges are serious\r\nStand up and face the bench\r\nHow do you plead, Sir? How do you plead?\n\n\n\n“Guilty as charged,” the Judge decreed, “stand up and face the bench\n\nI have some words to say to you before we recommence\n\nA list of crimes this serious, I swear I have not seen\n\nIn all the years that I have served Her Majesty the Queen\"\n\n\n\nArson, murder, blackmail, grand larceny and theft\n\nDrug dealing, human trafficking, I ask the court, what’s left?\n\nAre there words of mitigation, before I pass the sentence?\n\nAnything that you can tell the court to add to your defense?”\n\n\n\nI faced the court, thought long and hard before I gave reply\n\n“There’s something that you need to hear, from me before I die\n\nThe circumstances of my birth were something short of bliss\n\nI have this from my mother, it was told to me like this…\n\n\n\n\"The day that I was born, she said, The Good Lord woke from slumber\n\nLooking ‘round his timber yard, He found He had no lumber\n\nApart from some old twisted branch, in shadows left to lurk\n\nHe pulled it out into the light and set about his work.\"\n\n\n\n\"She told me that the world should not expect too much of me\n\nWhen the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree\n\nWhen the Good Lord carved my crooked soul, out of a crooked tree.”\n\n\n\n“Stand up and face the bench\n\nI’ve heard all you’ve got to say\n\nThat there look on your face says you’re guilty\n\nAnd now it’s your judgment day.”\n\n\n\n“I’m not asking for forgiveness\n\nI’m not proud of what I’ve done\n\nI did the things I had to do, like any other mother’s son\n\nNone of us are perfect, so remember what you see\n\nWhen the Good lord carved this crooked soul, out of a crooked tree\n\nWhen the Good Lord carved this crooked soul, out of a crooked tree.”",
