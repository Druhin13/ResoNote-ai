  "lyrics": "You got me going in circles\r\nYou were using words, and they got no purpose\r\nAnd you don't say what you don't say\r\nAnd you're saving me no time\r\nYou're just a contradiction\r\nNever say anything with conviction\n\nAnd we don't say what we want to say\n\nAnd it's the same thing every time\n\n\n\nYou think everything sucks\n\nI really couldn't give two fucks\n\nAnd why do you rely on luck\n\nWhen it don't really work like that?\n\nAnd man, do I wish it did\n\nImagine me throwing a fit\n\nI can't because you're being cryptic\n\nAnd I can't really work like—\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm so heartbroken\n\nI'm sick of being open to anything you throw at me\n\n'Cause I'm so heartbroken\n\nI'm sick of being open to everything you want from me\n\n\n\nYou to got me singing in verses\n\nI can be alone when I've got no service\n\nAnd you\n\nWhen we're working overtime\n\nYou don't wanna cause friction\n\nWe can all agree that we've got ambition\n\nAnd in some way, would you say\n\nIt can be so hard to define?\n\n\n\nYou think everything sucks\n\nI really couldn't give two fucks\n\nAnd why do you rely on luck\n\nWhen it don't really work like that?\n\nAnd man, do I wish it did\n\nImagine me throwing a fit\n\nI can't because you're being cryptic\n\nAnd I can't really work like—\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm so heartbroken\n\nI'm sick of being open to anything you throw at me\n\n'Cause I'm so heartbroken\n\nI'm sick of being open to everything you want from me\n\n\n\nYou think everything sucks\n\nI really couldn't give two fucks\n\nYou think everything sucks\n\nI really couldn't give two fucks\n\nAnd why do you rely on luck\n\nWhen it don't really work like that?\n\n\n\n'Cause I'm so heartbroken\n\nI'm sick of being open to anything you throw at me\n\n'Cause I'm so heartbroken\n\nI'm sick of being open to everything you want from me\n\n\n\nEverything sucks\n\nEverything sucks, I know\n\nWell, everything sucks\n\nEverything sucks, I know\n\nWell, everything sucks\n\nEverything sucks, I know",
