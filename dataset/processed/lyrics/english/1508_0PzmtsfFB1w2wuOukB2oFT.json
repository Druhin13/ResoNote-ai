  "title": "My Parallel (Skit)",
  "lyrics": "The Book of Ryan\r\nThe untold tale of scandal\r\nAll my bars of madness\r\nThat are inspired by my childhood, scars and sadness\r\nEvery black man must fend for himself\r\nWhere we value physical much more than we do our mental health\n\nAnd what the fuck you know about coming back from hitting rock bottom in life\n\nNigga all I want is a good home, and a wife\n\nAnd some children, and some food to feed 'em every night\n\nWhere's my parallel to that?\n\nNigga, where's my parallel to that?\n\nWhere's my parallel, to that?",
