  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Daily Liar par The Damned\r\nTell me\nWhat's the news today\nWhat is the state of play\nI'm drowning\nIn a sea of words\nNo life boats on the way\n\nDirect me so\nI can find\nMy way through\nThe obstacles ahead\nCause I believe\nAll that you've said\nDaily liar\n\nBelieve me\n\nWith no word of a lie\nHappiness is passing by\nTrust me\nTo be your guiding light\nOn this dark and evil night\n\nDirect me so\nI can find\nMy way through\nThe obstacles ahead\nCause I believe\nAll that you've said\nDaily liar\n\nWith skilful manipulation\nJoyriding in the bloody tracks\nOf a previous generation\nI'm drowning in a raging sea of words\n\nTry to hold on\nTo a sentence here and there\nTo stop me going down\nGoing down going down down down\nAnd I say no no no no no\nNo no no no no\nDo I look like a kind of guy\nWho truly believes in the smoke and mirrors\nNo no no\n\nSo tell me\nWhat's the news today\nWhat is the state of play\nAnd knowing\nWhat's right and what is wrong\nYour hold on me is gone\n\nNow I know\n\nI'm not at sea\nThere's a light\nA beacon of hope for me\nWell take it all with a pinch of salt\nDaily liar",
