  "lyrics": "Can I? Can I talk to you?\r\nJust for a little time to\r\nTell you how much I do, I do\r\nWish I could be someone new for you\r\nHow could you?\r\nLend your ear to let this total stranger move inside your mind\n\nThen into places that make you feel like someone new\n\nHow could you?\n\n\n\nTell me, what does she have that I don't have?\n\nGot me obsessed like a maniac\n\nGive me my wasted years back\n\nWhat does she have?\n\n\n\nI heard she got them green eyes that you like\n\nAnd if only I could bottle up the chemicals that make you so damn beautiful to me\n\nAnd if only I could drink 'em like medicinal\n\nI wouldn't need this ethanol in me\n\n'Cause I pull out all my eyelashes and make a million wishes\n\nWishing I was her (not me)\n\nNow you can see my green eyes better\n\n\n\nCan I? Can I talk to you?\n\nCould I ask you why you\n\nYou can only love me on our honeymoon?\n\nNow I see through you, you\n\nHow could you?\n\nTake my tiny heart, break it in two\n\nUndo the stitches in my wounds\n\nI don't think I ever really knew you\n\n\n\nTell me, what does she have that I don't have?\n\nGot me obsessed like a maniac\n\nGive me my wasted years back\n\nWhat does she have?\n\n\n\nI heard she got them green eyes that you like\n\nAnd if only I could bottle up the chemicals that make you so damn beautiful to me\n\nAnd if only I could drink 'em like medicinal\n\nI wouldn't need this ethanol in me\n\n'Cause I pull out all my eyelashes and make a million wishes\n\nWishing I was her (not me)\n\nNow you can see my green eyes better\n\n\n\nI tried to be cool but I can't help feeling\n\nI can't help feeling black and blue\n\nI tried to be cool but I can't help feeling\n\nI can't help feeling I lost you\n\n\n\nI lost you to them green eyes that you like\n\nAnd if only I could bottle up the chemicals that make you so damn beautiful to me\n\nAnd if only I could drink 'em like medicinal\n\nI wouldn't need this ethanol in me\n\n'Cause I pull out all my eyelashes and make a million wishes\n\nWishing I was her (not me)\n\nNow you can see my green eyes better",
