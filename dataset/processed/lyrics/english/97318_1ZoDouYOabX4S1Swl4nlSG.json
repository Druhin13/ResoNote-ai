(You know it)\n\nYou can hear my pipes all the way into the A.M.​\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M. (You know it)\n\nYou notice from before I was in every stoners playlist\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M\n\nAin't changed from the days when I didn't have a thing, bitch\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M. (You know it)\n\nI know they got them tags to cap the rappers when I hunt shit\n\n\n\nBeen whippin' off of my soul forever\n\nUntil the ocean is an empty desert\n\nUntil a fat chick grows big wings\n\nAnd sings the fuckin' National Anthem\n\nI'm so river rat until I [?] off to a monster brah\n\nI was a fish now I'm the megalodon that's hungry for your boat\n\nAnd I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms\n\nSo much smoke out my windows I'm hearin' my neighbors fire alarm\n\nMr. Cheatham County, Mr. nothing you can tell me\n\nMr. one of Nashville's legends, Johnny Cash would be impressed with Church\n\n\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M. (You know it)\n\nYou can hear my pipes all the way into the A.M.​\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M. (You know it)\n\nYou notice from before I was in every stoners playlist\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M\n\nAin't changed from the days when I didn't have a thing, bitch\n\nC.H.E.A.T.H.A.M.
