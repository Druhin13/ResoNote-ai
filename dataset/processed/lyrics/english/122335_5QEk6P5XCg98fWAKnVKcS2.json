  "lyrics": "I didn't know there was a tower\r\nWhere they look out to the land\r\nTo see the people quickly passing by\r\nThis is for their own desire\r\nAs they spit down to the earth\r\nTo feel the power\n\nBoiling in their veins\n\n\n\nOh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah\n\nOh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah\n\n\n\nAnd the black smoke rises\n\nFrom the fires we've been told\n\nIt's the new age crisis\n\nAnd we will stand up in the cold\n\nStand up in the cold\n\n\n\nMany people are dividing\n\nAnd a world apart\n\nWith just one heart\n\nIs bound to keel and fade away\n\nNone of us will be deciding\n\nAnd the fate of man is in the hands\n\nOf he who stands and heeds the call\n\n\n\nOh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah\n\nOh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah\n\n\n\nAnd the black smoke rises\n\nFrom the fires we've been told\n\nIt's the new age crisis\n\nAnd we will stand up in the cold\n\nStand up in the cold\n\n\n\nOh oh\n\nOh oh\n\n\n\nWe won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold\n\nWe won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold\n\nWe won't stand alone, we will stand up in the cold\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nAnd the black smoke rises\n\nFrom the fires we've been told\n\nIt's the new age crisis\n\nAnd we will stand up in the cold\n\n\n\nAnd the black smoke rises\n\nFrom the fires we've been told\n\nIt's the new age crisis\n\nAnd we will stand up in the cold\n\nStand up in the cold",
