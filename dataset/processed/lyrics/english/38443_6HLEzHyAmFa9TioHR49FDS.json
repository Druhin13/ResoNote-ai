  "lyrics": "The waves roll on\r\nOver the water\r\nAnd the ocean cries\r\nWe look to\r\nOur sons and daughters\r\nTo explain our lives\n\n\n\nAs if a child\n\nCould tell us why\n\nThat as sure as the sunrise\n\nAs sure as the sea\n\nAs sure as the wind in the trees\n\n\n\nWe rise again\n\nIn the faces of our children\n\nWe rise again\n\nIn the voices of our song\n\nWe rise again\n\nLike the waves out on the ocean\n\nAnd then, we rise again\n\n\n\nWhen the light grows dark\n\nWith the forces of creation\n\nAcross the stormy sky\n\nWe look to\n\nReincarnation\n\nTo explain our lives\n\n\n\nAs if a child\n\nCould tell us why\n\nThat as sure as the sunrise\n\nAs sure as the sea\n\nAs sure as the wind in the trees\n\n\n\nWe rise again\n\nIn the faces of our children\n\nWe rise again\n\nIn the voices of our song\n\nWe rise again\n\nLike the waves out on the ocean\n\nAnd then, we rise again\n\n...",
