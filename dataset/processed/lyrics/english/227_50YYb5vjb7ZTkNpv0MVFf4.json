  "lyrics": "I can still shut down a party\r\nI can hang with anybody\r\nI can drink whiskey or red wine\r\nChampagne all night\r\nLittle scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine\n\nBut when I taste tequila\n\nBaby I still see ya\n\nCutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt\n\nThe same one you wore when we were\n\nSky high in Colorado\n\nYour lips pressed against the bottle\n\nSwearing on the bible baby I'd never leave ya\n\nI remember how bad I need ya\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\n\n\nI can kiss somebody brand new\n\nAnd not even think about you\n\nI can show up to the same bar\n\nPlay the same songs in my car\n\nBaby your memory, it only hits me this hard\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nBaby I still see ya\n\nCutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt\n\nThe same one you wore when we were\n\nSky high in Colorado\n\nYour lips pressed against the bottle\n\nSwearing on the bible baby I'd never leave ya\n\nI remember how bad I need ya\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila, whoa-oh\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nBaby I still see ya\n\nSorority t-shirt\n\nSame one you wore when we were\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nBaby I still see ya\n\nCutting up the floor in a sorority t-shirt\n\nThe same one you wore when we were\n\nSky high in Colorado\n\nYour lips pressed against the bottle\n\nSwearing on the bible baby I'd never leave ya\n\nI remember how bad I need ya\n\n\n\nWhen I taste tequila\n\nWhen I taste tequila, whoa-oh",
