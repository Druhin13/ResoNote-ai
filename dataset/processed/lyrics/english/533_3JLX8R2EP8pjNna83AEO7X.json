  "lyrics": "I used to think she was the greatest thing\r\nI really cared, gave her a diamond ring\r\nShe said she'd rather die than ever leave me\r\nWell I never saw her face since then\r\nAnd if the law don't get her then I will-\r\nFour little diamonds\n\n\n\nShe must be somewhere on the open road\n\nShe always said she was a lonely one\n\nShe gets you down with her tales of woe\n\nShe took me for everything\n\nAnd if the law don't get her then I will\n\nFour little diamonds\n\n\n\nChorus: I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn\n\nBut she was gone with the night\n\nI thought about the things she said\n\nAnd all the things we'd done\n\nBut where could she run- she ran away\n\nThere's just no answer to give\n\n\n\nI keep wonderin' about her, day and night\n\nShe probably thinks I was a fool- she's right\n\nShe don't know it\n\nBut I'm gonna keep on searchin' for that woman\n\nI'm gonna search everywhere\n\nAnd if the law don't get her then I will\n\nFour little diamonds\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nI still hear her callin' out to me,\n\nI still listen for her endlessly\n\nBut it never even crossed my mind she was a cheater\n\nI gotta find where she hides\n\n'Cause if the law don't get her then I will -\n\nFour little diamonds",
