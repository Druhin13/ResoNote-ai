  "lyrics": "Well I could feel the sections of my\r\nBrain detaching\r\nI could feel the fluid in my head go bad\r\nI could see my future in his\r\nLeather jacket\r\nShining in the darkness of\n\nMy schoolboy past\n\n\n\nI lost my innocence to a\n\nBoy named Vincent\n\nBox of girl scout thin mints\n\nAnd a pack of Winstons\n\nI lost my innocence to a\n\nBoy named Vincent\n\nIn a single incident I was changed\n\n\n\nNow I'm a little creature\n\nIn the lazy evening\n\nI'm a little creature\n\nAnd they can't catch me\n\nLying semi-naked on his rooftop dreaming\n\nDreaming of the creature\n\nThat I used to be\n\n\n\nI lost my innocence to a\n\nBoy named Vincent\n\nBox of girl scout thin mints\n\nAnd a pack of Winstons\n\nI lost my innocence to a\n\nBoy named Vincent\n\nAnd a new existence soon found me\n\n\n\nI looked a real long time\n\nTo find the border\n\nOf a kingdom of love, outside the\n\nReigning order\n\nAnd I found my angel on a motorcycle\n\nI'm a queer for life\n\nOutlaw, outsider and uh\n\n\n\nI lost my innocence to a\n\nBoy named Vincent\n\nIn a single instance\n\nI joined the true resistence\n\nI lost my innocence to a\n\nBoy named Vincent\n\nIn a single instant I was set free",
