  "lyrics": "The sun leaves on its own\r\nA simple passage of the days that I have wasted\r\nI feel the summer slipping through\r\nThese aging fingers\r\nCompelled to walk upon the same path that I have tread so long\n\nStill nothing changes\n\nA simple passage to a place that I have come to know\n\nI still remember\n\n\n\nA better time\n\nWhen the thoughts that we had connected\n\nBetween our open eyes\n\nWe say goodbye, to a life that’s been mostly silent\n\nErroneously lead\n\n\n\nStrive to complete myself\n\nIt seems my work is never truly done\n\nI see your face, barely through the haze\n\nYou see a life, erroneously lead\n\n\n\nThere’s hope in younger days\n\nThere’s warmth within the past that’s so familiar\n\nI forget just why I came here\n\nI Hope that you remember\n\nHome\n\n\n\nAll this time I’ve wasted\n\nIn my self-righteous anger\n\nOh the years I’ve lost\n\nTo this profound indifference\n\nI find my direction\n\nA solemn duty owned\n\nMine, it is mine alone\n\nTo watch this world expire\n\n\n\nLike machines, we embrace\n\nCold limbs connect\n\nA silent, errored life\n\nSlipping into oblivion\n\n\n\nLead astray through endless days\n\nSilent now, the words so loud\n\n\n\nMy mind is drifting out\n\nBetween perception of a dream and what is real\n\nNow all I have is lost with you\n\nI hope that you remember\n\n\n\nA better time\n\nWhen the lights were all so candescent\n\nThat reached me from the sky\n\nWe say goodbye, to a life within dead horizons\n\nErroneously lead\n\n\n\nStrive to escape myself\n\nIt seems my work is never truly done\n\nI see your shape, falter in the wake\n\nOf a life erroneously lead",
