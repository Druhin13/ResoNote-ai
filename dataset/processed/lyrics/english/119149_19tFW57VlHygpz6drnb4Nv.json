  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Straightjacket par Quinn XCII\r\nShe's a psycho from a Midwest suburb\nNo straightjacket could hold her\nWild eyes, they would lure me in her trap\nI go mad just to hold her\n\nUntil I noticed that something was strange\nOut of my range, there was no way back\nSomething went off in my brain\nShe was insane, here she goes again\nA psycho from a Midwest suburb\nI woke up and I told her\n\nYou won't know me when the feeling's all gone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd the look on your face will slowly come undone\n'Cause it was all a front\n\nAnd quietly, I say it to your face\nThat you will need to find another place to stay\nAnd no you won't know me when the feeling's all gone\nAnd I tell everyone, ay\n\nShe's a loose cannon with a temper, so absurd\nHiding from the police, yeah\nTook pills with the name I'd never heard\nBut they were for sleep, she fooled me\n\nThat's when I noticed that something was strange\nOut of my range, there was no way back\nSomething went off in my brain\nShe was insane, here she goes again\nA psycho from a Midwest suburb\nI woke up and I told her\n\n\nYou won't know me when the feeling's all gone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd the look on your face will slowly come undone\n'Cause it was all a front\nAnd quietly, I say it to your face\nThat you will need to find another place to stay\nAnd now you won't know me when the feeling's all gone\nAnd I tell everyone, ay\n\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd I tell everyone\n\nI noticed that something was strange\nOut of my range, there was no way back\nSomething went off in my brain, she was insane\n\nHere she goes again\nA psycho from a Midwest suburb\nI woke up and I told her\n\nYou won't know me when the feeling's all gone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd the look on your face will slowly come undone\n'Cause it was all a front\nAnd quietly, I say it to your face\nThat you will need to find another place to stay\nAnd now you won't know me when the feeling's all gone\nAnd I tell everyone, ay\n\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd I tell everyone\nAnd I tell everyone",
