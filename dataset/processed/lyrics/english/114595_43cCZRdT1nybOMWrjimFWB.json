  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Stay par Khalid\r\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nIn the back of my mind I know it's hard on us\nBut to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love\nIt's not easy to say you're giving up\nAnd I've been losing count\n\nWhen the seconds turn to minutes into hours\nYou've been working 9 to 5\nSo it was hard to find the time for me, yeah\nAre we gonna be alright\nIf I come through tonight\n\nBaby can I stay a while\nIt's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah\nLet me inside, go 9 to 5\n\nJust know I'm coming home for a reason\nBaby can I stay a while\nIt's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving\nLet me inside, go 9 to 5\nJust know I'm coming home for a reason\nBaby can I stay a while\n\nAll the shit that you say, do you mean it?\nAnd when you tell me you love me do you believe it?\nI can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it\nAnd I've been missing out\n\nWhen the seconds turn to minutes into hours\nWorking 9 to 5 cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah\nAre we gonna be alright\nIf I come through tonight, yeah\n\n\nBaby can I stay a while\nIt's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving\nLet me inside, go 9 to 5\nJust know I'm coming home for a reason\nBaby can I stay a while\nIt's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving\nLet me inside, go 9 to 5\nJust know I'm coming home for a reason\nBaby can I stay a while\n\nBaby can I stay a while\nIt's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving\nLet me inside, go 9 to 5\nJust know I'm coming home for a reason\nBaby can I stay a while\nIt's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving\nLet me inside, go 9 to 5\n\nJust know I'm coming home for a reason\nBaby can I stay a while",
