  "lyrics": "I make a frown\r\nI always wear it upside down\r\n'Cause life is carnage\r\nI once was lost, but now I'm floundered\r\nAnd running late for my funerary date\r\nBurn me later, could you smile while you do it\n\n\n\nI don't care anymore\n\nSwear I don't care anymore\n\nI don't care anymore\n\nSwear I don't care anymore\n\n\n\nI was born with a lucky 88 on my door\n\nPut down your last claim to fame for me, boy\n\n(Keep me starving and get something better started)\n\nTrying to work in this town\n\nWithout a silver spoon or foot in your mouth\n\nYou see that lucky 88 on my door\n\n\n\nOne more time with reeling\n\nYou siphoned out the feeling\n\nCan't you act responsibly, you're the sick pup who created me\n\nBurn out and fade\n\nI'll convalesce you right into the grave\n\n\n\nI don't care anymore\n\nSwear I don't care anymore\n\nI don't care anymore\n\nSwear I don't care anymore\n\n\n\nI was born with a lucky 88 on my door\n\nPut down your last claim to fame for me, boy\n\n(Keep me starving and get something better started)\n\nI was born in the cold-clouded heart of the storm\n\nYou see that lucky 88 on the door\n\nKeep me starving, or get something better started\n\nKeep me starving, or get something started started\n\n\n\nWith a lucky 88 on my door\n\nA lucky 88 on my door\n\nWith a lucky 88 on my door\n\nA lucky 88\n\n\n\nDoo doo doo doo\n\nDoo doo doo doo\n\nDoo doo doo doo\n\nDoo doo doo doo",
