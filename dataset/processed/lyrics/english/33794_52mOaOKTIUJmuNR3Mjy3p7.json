  "lyrics": "I eat an orange every morning\r\nAnd I take my time with the peel\r\nIt's my beginner's meditation\r\nTo start my little journey on an even keel\r\nI will sail, as the hours roll by\n\nIn my twentieth-century automobile\n\nAnd a hotel employee\n\nWill sweep up the orange remnants\n\nLeaving no trace of this moment\n\nSo sweet and so real\n\n\n\nAh Ah Good God\n\n\n\nI am sailing\n\nI am driving toward\n\nThe end of my own need to drive\n\nThis is February 7th 2017\n\nI am shattered, I am bleeding, but God damn it\n\nI'm alive\n\n\n\nI am pulled, I am tossed\n\nBack and forth across\n\nThis country, like garbage with the tide\n\n\n\nI am citrus: peel back my skin\n\nOpen me and expose the soft wet inside\n\n\n\nAh, I -oh hell yeah",
