  "lyrics": "Awaken my sanity\r\nSlavery falls to the ground\r\nChains fall to gravity\r\nTruth can now be found\r\nMy freedom yet escapes me as if I am still in chains\r\nThe memory of servitude it somehow keeps me sane\n\nShadows â€“ my enemy\n\nYet beyond them now I see\n\nFear lingered in me\n\nKept me from being free\n\nPierce the veil of solitude and turn away\n\nI must\n\nSand in the hour glass my time is up at last\n\nGo forth and be all you can be\n\nSo you can see the path ahead\n\nLet our voice guide you on\n\nI feel only pain\n\nBut I know that everything shall pass\n\nThe end of the path that forever ignites\n\nWhite light is blinding me\n\nRobbing me of my sight\n\nSomehow it sets me free\n\nCalling me to unite\n\nA spell upon me cast\n\nBringing the final light of a long awaited dusk\n\nBlessed, you are the one\n\nWho opened his eyes to light\n\nNow go in peace\n\nAnd step out of this maze\n\nI thought that I'm insane\n\nI always knew there has to be more than this\n\nI am on my way out while you're embracing the dark\n\nWhen a messiah is born it's like a late blooming of a flower rising in the netherworld, waters of hope, falling on an orphaned land\n\nNo longer the slave\n\nNow I roam onto the unknown\n\nBut as sure as my heart beats\n\nI'm not afraid of the light",
