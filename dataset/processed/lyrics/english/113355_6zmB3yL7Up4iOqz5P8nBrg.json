  "lyrics": "People on the airwaves always preach who I should be\r\nHow to dress\r\nHow to talk\r\n“Baby” how to breathe\r\nWicked artist use their limber fingers\r\nTo paint pictures of what young girls are to aspire to be\n\nI’m not alive if I’m not on illegal weed\n\nI’m not in love without a man sitting next to me\n\nSomeone tell me if this is all an illusion\n\nOr if I’m just a cog in the...\n\n\n\n21st Century machine\n\nIt’s the place to be...\n\nIn the 21st Century Machine\n\nShelf light and live precariously\n\n\n\nSipping on rosè is your best solution\n\nDown it all till your stumbling with past confusion\n\nThen\n\nWake up and do it all over again\n\nYou only live once, Friday nights your only friend\n\nAnd you shouldn’t worry\n\nAbout your weight\n\nAnd trust me when you’re not looking they’ll all still say you look great\n\nOh they’ll still say you look great\n\n\n\nI’m in peril, they wanna give me hell\n\nThey look at me with hungry eyes as I’m another Infidel\n\nBut oh they like me\n\nThat’s why they wish me well\n\nThat’s why they pull me gently as I’m trapped inside their meld\n\n\n\nIn the 21st century machine\n\nIt’s the place to be\n\nIn the 21st century machine\n\nShelf light and live precariously\n\nIn the 21st century machine\n\nIt’s the place to be\n\n\n\nAnd if you saw me right now\n\nWould you still remember me?",
