  "lyrics": "Each morning I get up I die a little\r\nCan barely stand on my feet\r\nTake a look in the mirror and cry\r\nLord what you're doing to me\r\nI spent all my years in believing you\r\nBut I just can't get no relief, Lord\n\n\n\nSomebody\n\nOoh somebody\n\nCan anybody find me\n\nSomebody to love?\n\n\n\nI work hard\n\nEvery day of my life\n\nI work til' I ache in my bones\n\nAt the end of the day\n\nI take home my hard-earned pay all on my own\n\nI get down on my knees\n\nAnd I start to pray\n\nTil' the tears run down from my eyes, Lord\n\n\n\nSomebody\n\nOoh somebody\n\nCan anybody find me\n\nSomebody to love?\n\n\n\nFind me somebody to love\n\nFind me somebody to love\n\nFind me somebody to love\n\nFind me somebody to love\n\nFind me somebody to love\n\nFind me somebody to love (somebody)\n\nFind me somebody to love (somebody)\n\nCan anybody find me\n\nSomebody to love?",
