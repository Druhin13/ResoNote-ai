  "lyrics": "So you say you feelin' jealous\r\nWithout it, you don't know what love is\r\nWhen I mess up\r\nI know, I know [?]\r\nSo in shock when I feel shredded\r\nThe day I never will forget it\n\nSewn it up inside my bones\n\nAnd in my heart I know, I know\n\n\n\nIt's real like when I dream so vividly\n\nBut in my heart I know it's real\n\nFrom your locks down to your feet\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nHow my life was incomplete\n\nAnd in the dark I found you\n\nAnd now we got the sympathy\n\n(Got that sympathy)\n\n\n\nSo you say it feels reckless\n\nWent out and bought another necklace\n\nTo cover up the bruises on ya'\n\nBut what about the one I loaned ya'\n\nYou never made an edit\n\nNot done enough that you'd regret it\n\nBut I don't need a change to know\n\nThere is space for love to grow\n\n\n\nIt's real like when I dream so vividly\n\nBut in my heart I know it's real\n\nFrom your locks down to your feet\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nHow my life was incomplete\n\nAnd in the dark I found you\n\nAnd now we got the sympathy\n\n\n\nLike when I dream so vividly\n\nBut in my heart I know it's real\n\nFrom your locks down to your feet\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nHow my life was incomplete\n\nAnd in the dark I found you\n\nAnd now we got the sympathy\n\n\n\nLike when I dream so vividly\n\nBut in my heart I know it's real\n\nFrom your locks down to your feet\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nHow my life was incomplete\n\nAnd in the dark I found you\n\nAnd now we got the sympathy\n\n\n\nLike in when I dream so vividly\n\nBut in my heart I know it's real\n\nFrom your locks down to your feet\n\nAnd now I'll never forget it\n\nHow my life was incomplete\n\nAnd in the dark I found you\n\nAnd now we got the sympathy",
