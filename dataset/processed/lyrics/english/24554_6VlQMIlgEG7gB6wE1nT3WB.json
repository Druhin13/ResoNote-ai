  "lyrics": "I don't hang with hypocrites but I'm quick to call that kettle black\r\nSwear I'll say it to your face when I'm talking behind your back\r\nMy thoughts are kind of dirty but my clothes are clean\r\nWhat you see is what you get, but what you get ain't what it seems\r\nI'm just human buried in denial\n\nI judge people and i read the Bible\n\nI drink too much but my body is a temple\n\nI love Jesus but I cuss, just a little\n\nJust a little\n\n\n\nI don't care what people think 'cause that makes people think I'm cool\n\nAnd I won't ever tell a lie, other than the one I just told\n\nMy music's kind of dirty but my record's clеan\n\nSo what you see is what you get, but what you get ain't what it seems\n\n\n\nI'm just human buried in dеnial\n\nI judge people and i read the Bible\n\nI drink too much but my body is a temple\n\nI love Jesus but I cuss, just a little\n\nJust a little\n\n\n\nMy heart is kind of dirty but his blood is clean\n\nSo what you see is what you get, but what you get ain't what it seems\n\n\n\nI'm just human buried in denial\n\nI judge people and i read the Bible\n\nI've got tattoos but my body is a temple\n\nI love Jesus but I cuss\n\nHell we all cuss,just a little\n\nJust a little\n\nI cuss just a little\n\nJust a little",
