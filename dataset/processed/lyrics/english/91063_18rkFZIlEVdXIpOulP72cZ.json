  "lyrics": "Flashing lights, big ol' city\r\nYou never looked so pretty\r\nLike you do, like you do in this hotel room\r\nTied up hair, in my underwear\r\nWith your T-shirt on and my make-up gone\r\nI wanna stay with you in this hotel room\n\n\n\nYou put on a vintage shirt of a band you never heard\n\nRipped black jeans you paid extra for\n\nBut if you ask me what I like\n\n\n\nI wanna see your features\n\nI wanna see your flaws\n\nSo baby, take it off, baby, take it off (Take it, take it off)\n\nI can dive a little deeper\n\nWhen you got nothing on\n\nSo baby, take it off, baby, take it off\n\nAnd turn me on\n\nAnd turn me on\n\n\n\nSleepless nights, big ol' city\n\nMissed calls, we've both been busy\n\nBut when the clock hits eight you're at my place\n\nYou show up and you're showing off\n\nSuit and tie I wanna take off\n\n'Cause I just gotta see the real you with me\n\n\n\nYou take a movie out, but I put it away\n\nGot other things that I'd like on display\n\nIf we only got one night\n\n\n\nI wanna see your features\n\nI wanna see your flaws\n\nSo baby, take it off (Take it off), baby, take it off (Take it off)\n\nI can dive a little deeper (Deeper)\n\nWhen you got nothing on\n\nSo baby, take it off (Take it off), baby, take it off (Take it off)\n\nAnd turn me on\n\nAnd turn me on\n\n\n\nI kinda like you better when you take it off, take it off\n\nI can see you better when you're in the dark and your clothes are gone\n\nI kinda like you better when you take it off, take it off\n\nI can see you better, better (Oh, oh yeah)\n\n\n\nI wanna see your features\n\nI wanna see your flaws\n\nSo baby, take it off (Take it off), baby, take it off (Take it off)\n\nI can dive a little deeper\n\nWhen you got nothing on\n\nSo baby, take it off (Take it off), baby, take it off (Take it off)\n\nAnd turn me on\n\n\n\nSo baby, take it off\n\nAnd babe, oh, take it off",
