  "lyrics": "She's caviar and mascara\r\nI'm corduroy and leather\r\nIt'd take one hell of an imagination\r\nTo ever paint us together\r\nPlaces I like to haunt at\n\nShe wouldn't be caught dead\n\nDon't make sense to the neighbors, don't look good on paper\n\nAnd sure don't make sense in my head\n\n\n\nBut I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go\n\nGet in this heart like a wheel and baby, we'll roll\n\n\n\nCan't say there won't be rough patches\n\nScratches from thorns and briars\n\nOver or under, we'll roll like thunder\n\nAs long as there's tread on these tires\n\n\n\nI got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go\n\nGet in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll\n\n\n\nAin't no map, ain't no way\n\nAin't no lights on this long highway\n\nBut I know the way by heart\n\nBring on the dark\n\nHoney, don't worry\n\n\n\nBaby, I got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go\n\nGet in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's roll\n\nI got a heart like a wheel, baby, let's go\n\nGet in this heart like a wheel and baby, we roll\n\nGet in this heart like a wheel and baby, let's go",
