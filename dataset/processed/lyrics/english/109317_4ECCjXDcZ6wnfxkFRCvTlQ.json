  "lyrics": "You can catch me\r\nOn the wave no jet ski\r\nIce cold no Gretsky\r\nI don't got time to figure out how I feel, for real\r\nI don't got a mind to figure out the fake and the real, at all\r\nI don't got dollars to deepen my pockets\n\nStill got dimes, they nipping at the back of my heels\n\n'Cause I look good (Look good)\n\nI dress good (Look good, dress good)\n\nSmoke good (Smoke good)\n\nI stress a lot (Stress a lot)\n\n\n\nWho do I run to?\n\nThe papers in frontal the pain that is subdue\n\nThey can't see me undo\n\nThey can't see me undone, I'm too lit right now\n\nI'm big on the internet, pretend I ain't into that\n\n\n\nLove provides the fruits that don't live too far from the tree\n\nA peace of mind for her, the other half I can't be\n\nWhy should I give a fuck about feelings? (Feelings)\n\nMy heart's getting cold (Iceberg, ice cold)\n\nA piece of me to you is getting it\n\nHarder\n\n\n\nIt's been in my experience that whenever you show yourself\n\nFor real, for real, you know\n\nMotherfuckers like to take advantage, standing there naked you panic\n\nWhen vantage points don't get expanded\n\nThey offer you anecdotes based on the man that you were\n\nMore than the men that you plan to be\n\nI go right back to the cannabis\n\nIt's harder to change the intangibles\n\nBut I know I didn't get this way randomly\n\nHanding me cards that were played in advance\n\nSo while I poke her face, she stare grinning handsomely\n\nSix hands ahead of me, it had to be\n\nClean up my school, and janitor habits he gladly see\n\nBut there's just some things that I never speak\n\nThere's some things that\n\n\n\nYou can catch me (But you can't catch me that's the thing)\n\nOn the wave no jet ski\n\nIce cold no Gretsky\n\nI don't got time to figure out how I feel, for real\n\nI don't got a mind to figure out the fake and the real, at all\n\nI don't got dollars to deepen my pockets\n\nStill got dimes, they nipping at the back of my heels\n\nCause I look good (Look good)\n\nI dress good (Look good, dress good)\n\nSmoke good (Smoke good)\n\nI stress a lot (Stress a lot)\n\n\n\nWho do I run to?\n\nThe papers in frontal the pain that is subdue\n\nThey can't see me undo\n\nThey can't see me undone\n\nI'm too lit right now\n\nI'm big on the internet\n\nI'm big on the internet",
