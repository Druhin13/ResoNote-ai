  "lyrics": "Yeah, ha, ha\r\nYeah, yeah, huh\r\nHard to be mad when your crib is gated\r\nI dealt with jealousy and I felt hatred\r\nWhen you get money, you get over-hated\n\nSo I try to make more just to aggravate 'em\n\nAnd you drink, and you smoke\n\nAnd I wait and I hope\n\nThat you'll stay for the night\n\nBut you're leaving\n\nAnd you tell me you want me\n\nYou kiss me, you love me\n\nBut you can't give me a reason\n\n\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work, baby?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nYou know it can't\n\n\n\nYou quick to give up 'cause you lack patience\n\nDon't overthink if there's a chance to make it\n\nThis love thing hard, got you frustrated\n\nBut when you know it's real, you don't mind waiting\n\nAnd you drink, and you smoke\n\nAnd I wait and I hope\n\nThat you'll stay for the night\n\nBut you're leaving\n\nAnd you tell me you want me\n\nYou kiss me, you love me\n\nBut you can't give me a reason\n\n\n\nJust give it a chance\n\nGive it a chance\n\nIt's only a chance\n\nWon't you give it a chance\n\nJust give it a chance\n\nIt's only a chance\n\n\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work, baby?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nYou know it can't\n\n\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work, baby?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nYou know it can't\n\n\n\nIt's hard to open up when you're still hurting\n\nYou tried to fall in love but it wasn't working\n\nCompare me to your ex, I'm a better version\n\nYou know that I'm the one, you can stop searching\n\nAnd you drink, and you smoke\n\nAnd I wait and I hope\n\nThat you'll stay for the night\n\nBut you're leaving\n\nAnd you tell me you want me\n\nYou kiss me, you love me\n\nBut you can't give me a reason\n\n\n\nJust give it a chance\n\nGive it a chance\n\nIt's only a chance\n\nWon't you give it a chance\n\nJust give it a chance\n\nIt's only a chance\n\n\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work, baby?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nYou know it can't\n\n\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work?\n\nWhy can't we work, baby?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nWhy can't this work?\n\nYou know it can't",
