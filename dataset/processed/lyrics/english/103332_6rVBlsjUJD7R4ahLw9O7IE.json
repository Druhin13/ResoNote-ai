Fuck it, let's triple it\n\nWhat you got? Gimme a hit of it\n\nIn that top? See you nip slippin' it\n\nBaby, just give me a little bit\n\n\n\nI have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, every time\n\nI get a little bit, little bit, little bit too drunk, but I'm fine\n\nI have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, but this time\n\nOh I'll be givin' it, givin' it, givin' it all up, for a little bit of you tonight\n\nI have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, every time (every time)\n\nI get a little bit, little bit, little bit too drunk, but I'm fine (but I'm fine)\n\nI have a little bit, little bit, little bit too much, but this time (but this time)\n\nOh I'll be givin' it, givin' it, givin' it all up, for a little bit of you tonight",
