  "lyrics": "Frozen in time\r\nWhen the world is moving at the speed of light\r\nTrapped inside these walls, you can't rise until you fall\r\nAnd start to trust your heart over your mind\r\nA diamond turned to stone\r\nFrom the fear of falling into the great unknown\n\nYou're trapped in endless nights, you've lost the will to fight\n\nLike a lantern that's lost its glow\n\n\n\nYou're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need\n\nBut you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap\n\nRight now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach\n\nBut you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap\n\n(Paralyzed, afraid to take the leap)\n\n\n\nThese chains grow stronger with time\n\nBut they can still be broken, you're not alone in this fight\n\nTrapped inside these shells\n\nThe best version of ourselves is waiting to escape this hell\n\n\n\nYou're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need\n\nBut you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap\n\nRight now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach\n\nBut you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap\n\n\n\nThe only way to survive this life is to take the leap\n\nThe only way to survive this life is to take the leap\n\n\n\nYou're a hundred feet above the ocean, and the water's all you need\n\nBut you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap\n\nRight now you can't see the path before you, the horizon is out of reach\n\nBut you're paralyzed, afraid to take the leap\n\n\n\nThe only way to survive this life is to take the leap\n\nThe only way to survive this life is to take the leap\n\n(The only way to survive this life is to take the leap)",
