  "lyrics": "Frankie died just the other night\r\nSome say it was suicide\r\nBut we know\r\nHow the story goes\r\nWith his six string knife\n\nAnd his street wise pride\n\nThe boy was a man before his time\n\nAnd she knew\n\nAll their dreams would come true\n\n\n\nBut ya see, Frankie was fast\n\nToo fast to know\n\nHe wouldn't go slow\n\nUntil his lethal dose\n\nAnd she knows\n\nHe'll finally come too close\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\nWell, on with the show\n\nGoing on with the show\n\nCome on baby\n\nNo, no, no\n\nOh my, my, my . . . [repeat]\n\n\n\nHe was bad\n\nHe was never good\n\nBut one thing that he understood\n\nAnd she knew\n\nAll those lies would come true The time has come and\n\nHe's paid his dues\n\nSuzy finally got the news\n\nShe always knew\n\nThis day would come soon\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHe was stopped on a dime\n\nWith a switchblade knife\n\nSome damn punk went and\n\nTook Frankie's life\n\nAnd she knew\n\nShe'd have to pull through\n\n\n\nBroken down, with his broken dreams\n\nWith a wink of an eye\n\nSaid Suzy, listen to me\n\nYou must go\n\nOn with the show\n\n\n\nGo on with the show\n\nGoing on with the show\n\nCome on baby\n\nNo nono\n\nOh my my my my [repeat]\n\n\n\nOh baby",
