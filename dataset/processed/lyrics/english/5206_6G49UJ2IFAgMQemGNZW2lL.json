  "lyrics": "Where do you see yourself when everything goes wrong?\r\nAt the bottom of the barrel that's when you must be strong\r\nWith chaos all around you, you feel like checking out\r\nYour life is dark and crowded, your mind is full of doubt\r\nCan't you see it's got to be, you gotta somehow try to\n\nMake a difference in your life\n\nKeep strong, it's up to you, you gotta try\n\nAnd make it through and save your life\n\n\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nYou're only thing that matters, just keep on moving on\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nThe only thing that matters is your life\n\nJust keep on moving on\n\n\n\nYou ever feel downhearted, your life is in a rut\n\nYour brain is overloaded and everything just sucks\n\nYou hope for something better, you're waiting for a gun\n\nThere's people all around but no one says a word\n\n\n\nCan't you see it's got to be, you gotta somehow try to\n\nMake a difference in your life\n\nKeep strong, it's up to you, you gotta try\n\nAnd make it through and save your life\n\n\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nYou're only thing that matters, just keep on moving on\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nThe only thing that matters is your life\n\nJust keep on moving on\n\n\n\nChange it all, it's up to you, you gotta try\n\nAnd make it through and save your life\n\nCan't you see it's got to be, you gotta somehow try to\n\nMake a difference in your life\n\nThe time's out, don't sit around\n\nWhen everything has got you down, the time is right\n\nIt's up to you, there's no excuse, just struggle on\n\nAnd make it through and save your fucking life\n\n\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nYou're only thing that matters, just keep on moving on\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nThe only thing that matters is your life\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nYou're only thing that matters, just keep on moving on\n\nStay strong and carry on\n\nThe only thing that matters is your life\n\nJust keep on moving on",
