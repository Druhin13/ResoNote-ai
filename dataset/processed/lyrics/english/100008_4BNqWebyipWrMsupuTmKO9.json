  "lyrics": "Never could maintain contact\r\nNo one can bring my uncle back\r\n(Soon)\r\nCan I need you soon?\n\nCandy, for my sail\n\nStranded, embracing deep pale\n\nMy mother said\n\nAin't nobody owe you shit\n\nAin't nobody owe you shit\n\n\n\nBought iguanas just to let 'em go\n\nBottle highs sell 'em for the low\n\nVR video\n\nPorno disappointing\n\nI can't relate with a white dick\n\nI can't escape when the night hit\n\nGot a text from an old friend\n\nTalking 'bout \"nigga where you been?\"\n\n\n\nIn my skin\n\nIn my thoughts\n\nOff rip\n\nI'm just counting down blocks\n\nTo my refuge\n\nPlenty capable\n\nI don't need rescue\n\nBut it helps when you drift through\n\nBut it helps when you drift through\n\n\n\nLook down at my wrist awful human it is\n\nI see uncles and aunties my ice in a grip\n\nBetween blue as in airless\n\nRun with the restless, no Paris\n\nIt's local bucha and Ferris wheels\n\nDon't give into what the careless feel\n\nI hold a peel off a quarter mill\n\nFor my morning meal\n\nNow my tummy still\n\nNiggas testing my limits I offer deals\n\nNever overkill\n\nSlow stroke water never spill\n\nSlowpoke got a pink cover on a yellow field\n\nWheat sells but it ain't gold\n\nPut my daddy's plans on hold\n\nI'ma do me, I got new goals\n\nI got new goals, I got new goals\n\n\n\nFlip it and clip it then sell it\n\nDrip by the minute I tell 'em\n\nBig tour feeling real now\n\nBillboards don't look down",
