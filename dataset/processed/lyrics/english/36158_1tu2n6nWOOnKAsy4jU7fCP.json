  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson So High par ASLOVE\r\nYou said it’s game \nCause you know that I’m a skeptic\nActing all defensive \nI can’t be hurt again\nAll the same\nYou’re like a psychedelic\nCan’t help but be tempted\nI’m steppin’ into flames\nAnd I feel dizzy when you look into my eyes.....\nHave to tell you what I feel inside\nNo body else’s arms \nCould take me from your charms \nOh oh oh \nYou got me feelin’ like, feelin’ like, feelin’ like\n\n\nSo high, my whole body is on fire\nI think I’m falling for your touch (Babe) \nI’m so high\nI’m a light with desire\nI know that you’re the one I love\n\nI won't be ashamed\nWhen the spark is just electric\nThe heart is not deceptive\nIt doesn't feel the same\nNot afraid \nThey may say we look pathetic\nYou know it’s authentic\nSometimes you can’t explain\nAnd I feel dizzy when you look into my eyes.....\nHave to tell you what I feel inside\nNo body else’s arms \nCould take me from your charms \n\nOh oh oh \nYou got me feelin’ like, feelin’ like, feelin’ like\n\nSo high, my whole body is on fire\nI think I’m falling for your touch (Babe) \nI’m so high\nI’m a light with desire\nI know that you’re the one I love\n\nCarry me home, and I won’t stray\nInside these walls, we’ll hide away\nOur love is real, and your body close\nWhat do you feel when my heart goes\nOh oh oh oh...\n\nSo high, my whole body is on fire\nI think I’m falling for your touch (Babe) \n\nI’m so high\nI’m a light with desire\nI know that you’re the one I love",
