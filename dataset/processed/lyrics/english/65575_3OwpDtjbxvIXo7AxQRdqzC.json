  "lyrics": "Ev'ry time i see your face,\r\nIt reminds me of the places we used to go.\r\nBut all i got is a photograph\r\nAnd i realise you're not coming back anymore.\r\nI thought i'd make it the day you went away,\n\nBut i can't make it\n\nTill you come home again to stay-yi-yay-yi-yay.\n\n\n\nI can't get used to living here,\n\nWhile my heart is broke, my tears i cried for you.\n\nI want you here to have and hold,\n\nAs the years go by and we grow old and grey.\n\n\n\nNow you're expecting me to live without you,\n\nBut that's not something that i'm looking forward to.\n\n\n\nI can't get used to living here,\n\nWhile my heart is broke, my tears i cried for you.\n\nI want you here to have and hold,\n\nAs the years go by and we grow old and grey.\n\n\n\nEv'ry time i see your face,\n\nIt reminds me of the places we used to go.\n\nBut all i got is a photograph\n\nAnd i realise you're not coming back anymore.\n\n\n\nEv'ry time i see your face,\n\nIt reminds me of the places we used to go.\n\nBut all i got is a photograph\n\nAnd i realise you're not coming back anymore.\n\n\n\nEv'ry time i see your face,\n\nIt reminds me of the places we used to go.\n\nBut all i got is a photograph\n\nAnd i realise you're not.",
