  "lyrics": "Our love is like lightning\r\nIt's beautiful, it's frightening sometimes\r\nBut if we're together\r\nWhatever the weather, we'll find shelter\r\nWhen it rains, it pours\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nWhen that blue sky is torn\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nKeep holding on\n\nWhen that thunder's crashing, don't look back\n\nJust take my hand, keep running\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\n\n\nIt's hard but you trust it\n\nIt's sweet but destructive, sometimes\n\nWe're broken, we're perfect\n\nBut it's always worth it, I'll always be there by your side\n\n\n\nWhen it rains, it pours\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nWhen that blue sky is torn\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nKeep holding on\n\nWhen that thunder's crashing, don't look back\n\nJust take my hand, keep running\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\n\n\nWhen it rains, it pours\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nWhen that blue sky is torn\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nKeep holding on\n\nWhen that thunder's crashing, don't look back\n\nJust take my hand, keep running\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm\n\nGotta stay ahead of the storm",
