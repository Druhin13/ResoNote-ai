  "lyrics": "I stole a key\r\nTook a car downtown where the lost boys meet\r\nI took a car downtown and took what they offered me\r\nTo set me free\r\nI saw the lights go down at the end of the scene\r\nI saw the lights go down and they're standing in front of me\n\n\n\nMy scarecrow dreams\n\nWhen they smashed my heart into smithereens\n\nI be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete\n\nBe the cartoon heart\n\n\n\nLight a fire, light a spark\n\nLight a fire, a flame in my heart\n\nWe'll run wild oh\n\nWe'll be glowing in the dark\n\nWe'll be glowing in the dark\n\n\n\nAll the boys, all the girls\n\nAll the madness in the world\n\nAll the boys, all the girls\n\nAll the madness that occurs\n\nAll the highs, all the lows\n\nAs the room is spinning, oh\n\n\n\nWe'll run wild oh\n\nWe'll be glowing in the dark\n\n\n\nSo we soar luminescent and wired\n\nWe'll be glowing in the dark",
