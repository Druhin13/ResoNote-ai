we do it for h-town\n\n\n\n[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]\n\nEven after the Ozone Awards is over\n\nWe still feeling like ain't nobody colder\n\nStill throwing twenty inch swangs on the Rover\n\nCandy like they dated twenty fifth of October\n\nTold ya'll to chill with that instigatin'\n\nYou say you from the H and it's instant hatin'\n\nWe started the trend you imitatin'\n\nThese swangas and voughes these isn't daytons\n\nSeen us doing it in Harlem Knights\n\nSay we do it big then you boys is right\n\nSpending more dough than you saw in ya life\n\nAnd that's just what ya boy spent on the dice\n\nInstigatin' you instigatin' we gon' hold it dine yea ya'll see\n\nHate won't ever live as long as me\n\nEnd of the bullet where the karma be\n\nWhy you wanna try to come talk to me\n\nTry to ask me if Rick Ross still a G\n\nJournalists need to get up off my D\n\nHim and E-Class always kept it real with me\n\nThe rap game looking so childish lately\n\nTold me the industry is bound to break me\n\nCan't let the fakeness dominate me\n\nStep up in the streets say it's time to pay me\n\nAin't never been a friend of the industry\n\nI ain't never been a friend of the gimmicky\n\nI ain't never been good with the chemistry\n\nBut let me tell ya'll clowns what it's finna be\n\nTexas ain't as hot as it was so they say we ain't as worth as much\n\nRingtone rappers actors dancers trappers they just outworking us\n\n50 Cent working way harder baby\n\nAnd Lil Wayne was working harder too\n\nAll of us was getting street paper but that was way before Carter 2\n\nIf you from Texas and a Screw head when I wrote this Verse I swear I thought of you\n\nAnother clique should've came behind us we already showed what working hard\n\nWould do payed the price to live the major life but when we hear the hate we tell\n\nBoys to chill\n\nBun B the main Texas rapper holding Texas up right now for real\n\nPimp passed we should've learned from that we ought to all be helping Bun\n\nRep the trill\n\nRep the swangs\n\nRep the paint\n\nRep the bang\n\nRep the grill\n\nSeen Pat in a red Lincoln seen Slim Thug in a photo drop\n\nSo I had to chop off the roof take a picture of that and call it photo chop\n\nBeen riding clean\n\nSince Rodney King\n\nMartin Luther Dream and chrome monoblocks\n\nAll of us been repping Texas baby one thing I know is that it sho' don't stop\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nWe hear em talking dine\n\nBut we still\n\nOn the grind\n\nCrawlin' slow\n\nTippin' dine\n\nBut we do it for h-town\n\nWe back up on the rise\n\nFeeling good\n\nFeeling fine\n\nPoppin' trunk\n\nTippin' dine\n\nBut we do it for h-town\n\nTell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nTell tell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for h-town\n\nTell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nTell tell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for h-town\n\n\n\n[Verse 2: Slim Thug]\n\nH-Town nawfside\n\nThat's where the boss ride\n\nHaters get ya mouth wide\n\nYa insides outside\n\nTalking down on my side\n\nNaw we don't play that\n\nWhere you say that will be the same place you lay at\n\nWe been sipping drank by the pint since way back\n\nWe been candy paint on them 4s since they made that\n\nHop up in my fly ride watch the top lay back\n\nRather flip a drop 'Lac before I flip a Maybach\n\nWonder why I say that\n\nI'm so hood\n\nAnd it ain't shit better than this leather and the wood\n\nGot my diamonds looking good and my hand on remote\n\nAnd I'm tucked in that buck while I float like a boat\n\nLooking clean like soap\n\nDiamond rope on my throat\n\nAnd I'm feeling presidential please vote for the hope\n\nIf we vote for ya hope\n\nPlease answer one note\n\nLet us get in mo' dough\n\nEverybody going broke\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nWe hear em talking dine\n\nBut we still\n\nOn the grind\n\nCrawlin' slow\n\nTippin' dine\n\nBut we do it for h-town\n\nWe back up on the rise\n\nFeeling good\n\nFeeling fine\n\nPoppin' trunk\n\nTippin' dine\n\nBut we do it for h-town\n\nTell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nTell tell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for h-town\n\nTell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nTell tell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for h-town\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Trae]\n\nKing of the streets no days no sleep\n\nPaint wet as hell with reptiles on the seats\n\nTrunk got an attitude yelling out when it speak\n\nPissed off the top it been lost for a week\n\nSlab looking like Shaq by the way it post up\n\nGuaranteed to hit haters no less than close up\n\nNiggas mad cause the south done rose up\n\nLike Yao Ming big swangs on trucks\n\nFind me in the hood on a couple of blocks\n\nWith a couple Aks and a couple of Glocks\n\nNo work in the trunk for a couple of stops\n\nDuffle bag when I pay away a couple of cops\n\nI dedicate this to Hawk and Pimp C\n\nMoe and Fat Pat, Screw and Lil E\n\nI rep them the same way I rep TDC\n\nIf it wasn't for them then what would I be\n\nWith diamonds I'm a stay shining bright\n\nH-town all day and all night\n\nI chose the pace to come take the throne\n\nCause some of these niggas ain't living right\n\nWe slowed up shit and we changed the game\n\nCopped the old school and we changed the frame\n\nAnd wave the trunk that reads 'I Am the H'\n\nAnything you saying you better change ya name\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nWe hear em talking dine\n\nBut we still\n\nOn the grind\n\nCrawlin' slow\n\nTippin' dine\n\nBut we do it for h-town\n\nWe back up on the rise\n\nFeeling good\n\nFeeling fine\n\nPoppin' trunk\n\nTippin' dine\n\nBut we do it for h-town\n\nTell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nTell tell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for h-town\n\nTell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nTell tell them boys it's time to lay it dine\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for\n\nCause we do it for h-town",
