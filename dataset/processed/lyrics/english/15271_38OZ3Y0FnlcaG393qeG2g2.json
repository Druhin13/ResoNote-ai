Joe\r\nYou can't fuck, that's a no\r\nI am picky, afro\r\nBank on tic-tac-toe\r\nAll you see is 0, 0, 0's\n\nBitch, you know I'm in my glow\n\nEat up the beat, I'll take it to go\n\nI don't answer the phone\n\nBitch, run me a letter\n\nSlide to my crib if you got me some cheddar\n\nHis blood spill when I shot the Beretta\n\nI had to walk home, in the inside I sweat her\n\nI don't let shit fly by, I just makes hoes fly high\n\nKill him with his tie, kill him with his tie\n\nKill him with his tie, that's tie-dye\n\n\n\nPass that money 'round like hot potato\n\nHoes circle, got bread like a bagel\n\nThrow hands to his face like a facial\n\nThat bullet hole look like a navel\n\nPass that money 'round like hot potato\n\nHoes circle, got bread like a bagel\n\nThrow hands to his face like a facial\n\nThat bullet hole look like a navel\n\n\n\nBig money, feeling pumpy\n\nAdios, can't get shit from me\n\nFive meals in my tummy\n\nEquals up to your rent money\n\nDon't let your nigga play you like he's Stevie\n\nHe do a triple take when he see me\n\nI might just talk to him real briefly\n\nTell him to drop you off then come eat me\n\nThat's if you like it or not\n\nI'm a business woman on top\n\nAnd I don't Facebook\n\n'Cause my face booked on every fucking flyer that drop\n\nThis that knock, knock, who's there?\n\nFront porch, front porch, you\n\nBitch, if you don't answer this door right now\n\nBullets 'bout to come through\n\nPlay if you want, today I got time\n\nI wouldn't even phone even if I was blind\n\nWho said I can't rap? That lil' bitch lying\n\nI'm bringing that heat like the clothes is dry, so stop it\n\nBitches ain't on my profit\n\nI'm a messy bitch so watch it\n\nI'ma spill the tea ain't no Marvin\n\nBitch mean muggin', wearing pony tails\n\nSo I'm guessing she a bum dummy\n\nSo I beat her ass into the rubber band\n\nLike I need that for more money\n\nCone head bitch, 'bout to be missing toppings\n\nTake off her head like a discount shopping\n\nCome to the block, don't put me on the block\n\nWith his dread head schemin'\n\nThat's a motherfucking plot twist\n\n\n\nPass that money 'round like hot potato\n\nHoes circle, got bread like a bagel\n\nThrow hands to his face like a facial\n\nThat bullet hole look like a navel\n\nPass that money 'round like hot potato\n\nHoes circle, got bread like a bagel\n\nThrow hands to his face like a facial\n\nThat bullet hole look like a navel",
