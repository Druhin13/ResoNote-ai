  "lyrics": "I auditioned for your heart\r\nPlay me like a harp\r\nMade me play the part of the fool\r\nI petitioned for your love and attention\r\nYou are an addiction I just can't fuel\r\nAnd you are the air that I breathe\n\nSo toxic for me\n\nA pill I was willing to take\n\nBut it's silly to pretend so I gotta go and mend up\n\nThe heart that I carefully taught you to break\n\n\n\nI taught you to hurt me\n\nTrained you to burn me\n\nLet you desert me, I\n\n\n\nYou know how to break my heart\n\nYou know how to break my heart\n\nAnd I don't know how you do it\n\nBut we try again and then you lie again\n\nYou know how to break my heart\n\nYou know how to break my heart\n\nBut the last time will be the last time\n\nI let you break my heart",
