  "lyrics": "I know you mean well\r\nI know you can't tell what has happened to you\r\nAnd this hell that cradles you\r\nI know you mean well but this happened too soon\r\nThe remains left haunting you\n\nTime begins to wash away the good and the bad\n\nNo remorse and no apologies\n\nYou've become a stranger to the thoughts in your head\n\n\n\nDon't forget my face\n\nLeave me erased\n\nNow I watch you slip into a\n\nDark state darker fat dark for days\n\nNow I'm erased\n\n\n\nLie in peace by yourself\n\nI saw your mind let itself out\n\nDust to dust we accept what we must\n\nWhile we're smiling and waiting in rust\n\nWell prepared for the time I'd be on this side separated by divine\n\n\n\nTime begins to wash away the good and the bad\n\nNo remorse and no apologies\n\nYou've become a stranger to the thoughts in your head\n\nAnd I can't change a thing\n\n\n\nDon't forget my face\n\nLeaving me erased\n\nNow I watch you slip into a\n\nDark state darker fat dark for days\n\nNow I'm erased",
