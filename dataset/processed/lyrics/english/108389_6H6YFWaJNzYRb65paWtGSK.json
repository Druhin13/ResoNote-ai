  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Dear God par Hunter Hayes\r\nHere I go again\nThree glasses in, counting my sins\nHome alone again\nThree in the morning, just me and my demons at war again\nSo I'm calling\nAre you listening?\n\nYou made a man this fragile\nYou made a heart that can break\nYou showed me the road less traveled\nFor when I'm gonna run away\nYou made me love so hard\nWhen everything I love just leaves\nAre you sure there's nothing wrong with me?\n\n\nAnd why does my life have to hurt so much?\nWhy can't I find any piece of love?\nAnd why do I feel like I'm not enough?\nDear God, are you sure that you don't mess up?\n\nYou still call it praying\nAll that I do is siting here cursing\nCursing your name again\nThe truth is it's not even you\nIt's just me that I'm up against\nBut you made me this\nCan we share the blame for this? Mmm\n\n'Cause you made a man this fragile\nYou made a heart that can break\nYou showed me the road less traveled\nFor when I'm gonna run away\nYou made me love so hard\n\nWhen everything I love just leaves\nAre you sure there's nothing wrong with me?\n\n'Cause why does my life have to hurt so much?\nWhy can't I find any piece of love?\nAnd why do I feel like I'm not enough?\nDear God, are you sure that you don't, that you don't mess up?\nYou don't mess up\nI know you don't mess up\nI know that you don't mess up\n\nI know this ain't for nothing\nThere's nothing you don't make\nI know you got your reasons\nThis shit's just hard to take\nI don't mean to criticize\nI know I'm hard to teach\n\nI know you tell me there's nothing wrong with me\n\nYeah but why does my life have to hurt so much?\nAnd why can't I find any piece of love?\nAnd why do I feel like I'm not enough?\nDear God, are you sure that you don't, that you don't mess up?\nYou don't mess up\nI know you don't mess up, yeah\nDear God, just remind me you don't mess up",
