  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Whatever par The Frights\r\nI used to like FIDLAR\nThat's what she told me\nAs I got into my van to see the country\n\nNow she’s got a new boyfriend\nOr so I'm guessing\nProbably kisses her way better and that's depressing\n\nNow I'm drinking in Philly\nWhile thinking of Sarah\nAnd there's a million little things she's unaware of\n\nCouldn’t tell if she saw me, or if she's even looking\n\nThere's no other place I'd rather be than Brooklyn\n\nAnd I am so fucking sick\nOf you acting like a dick\nI’m just trying to pull my life back together\nAnd I am too fucking tired\nOf you calling me a liar\nJust tell you what I want, I’ll say whatever\n\nI was thinking about calling\nBut I’m feeling lazy\nEight hundred miles in a car can drive you crazy\n\nWe could say that it was worth it\nFor a minute it was perfect\nBut I’m tired of this hurting\nI need to work shit out\n\n\nAnd I'm still messed up\nFrom when you said you didn’t love me\nThirty minutes before we played\nTen songs about your name\n\nAnd this crowd is screaming back\nAs I had a heart attack\nAs I tried to play the lead\nAs I yelled “You’re all I need”\n\nAnd I am so fucking sick\nOf you acting like a dick\nI’m just trying to pull my life back together\nAnd I am too fucking tired\nOf you calling me a liar\nJust tell you what I want, I’ll say whatever\n\n\nI freaked out when I saw her there\nI didn’t know what to do\nLooked at me like I meant something\nI never saw that in you\nI won't let you go 'cause I love you more than I ever wanted to\n\nAnd I am so fucking sick\nOf you acting like a dick\nI’m just trying to pull my life back together\nAnd I am too fucking tired\nOf you calling me a liar\nJust tell you what I want, I’ll say whatever",
