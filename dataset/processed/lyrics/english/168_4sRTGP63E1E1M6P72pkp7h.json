  "lyrics": "Well sometimes I get lonely\r\nEven though it's only been a good forty five minutes since I left your house\r\nAnd I can't help from feeling like I'm tired of being slowed down by all the shit I put inside myself\r\nIt's time to get some help\r\nFrom someone who's not you or my parents\n\n'Cause there's no one else who can work these issues out except for me\n\n\n\nSo I guess that we'll see in a few years\n\nIf all the work we did held strong\n\nAnd if I ever move out of my dad's house\n\nThen I will finally be alone\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what I told myself I didn't want (waaant)\n\nThis is exactly what I told myself I didn't want (waaant)\n\nThis is exactly what I told myself\n\nThis is exactly what It old myself\n\nThis is exactly what\n\nExactly what\n\nThis is exactly exactly exactly exactly\n\n\n\nBut I guess it's not that far of a drive back to my house\n\nIt's closer than it may seem\n\nIf you can manage to find a good parking spot\n\nIt could be worse\n\nAt least I still get to be around you\n\nEvery chance that I can",
