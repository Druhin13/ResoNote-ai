  "lyrics": "I wasn't a fighter 'til somebody told me\r\nI had better learn to lean into the punch\r\nSo I don't hurt as bad when they leave\r\nThere you were, turning your cheek\r\nI look at you and you look at a screen\n\nI'm in the back seat of my body\n\nI'm just steering my life in the video game\n\nSimilar acts in a different name\n\nIt's a slow down\n\n\n\nSo would you teach me I'm the villain\n\nAren't I, aren't I the one?\n\nConstantly repenting for a difficult mind\n\nPush me down into the water like a sinner\n\nHold me under and I'll never come up again\n\nI'll just stay down\n\n\n\nIt's a half-life\n\nIt's a fallout\n\nIt takes so long for me to settle down\n\nAnd when I finally do there's no one else around\n\nSo I stay down\n\nSo I stay down\n\nSo I stay down\n\nSo I stay down\n\nSo I stay down",
