  "lyrics": "I can’t tell you what it means\r\nWhen you are here, I am at ease\r\nI don’t blame you when you’re gone\r\nFor the sadness in my song\r\nThat weight is mine alone, that shadow is my own\n\nThe coast is never clear\n\nI’ll wait for morning though, you will arrive\n\nSo we can watch that shadow disappear\n\n\n\nIf you try to be with me, I will try to get by\n\nSome say I’m a fool for waiting\n\nThey don’t know, this fool doesn’t mind\n\n\n\nThey tell me “Give it up”\n\nBut I won’t ever give it up\n\n\n\nBecause when the night does fade\n\nI’m alive in the strangest way\n\nThose first few cracks of dawn\n\nAre a taste of what’s to come\n\n\n\nAnd yes I hum and haw about nothing at all\n\nI get lost in fear\n\nBut no thief or act of god could take this grin I’ve got\n\nI know you will be here\n\n\n\nAnd if you try to be with me, I will try to get by\n\nSome say I’m a fool for waiting\n\nThey don’t know, this fool doesn’t mind\n\n\n\nThey tell me “Give it up”\n\nBut I won’t ever give it up\n\n\n\nAh, they tell me…\n\nSo what she’s in your head?\n\nShe’s gonna leave again?\n\nWhat’s gonna happen then?\n\nShe’s just enabling\n\nAnd there is truth to that\n\nBut I ain’t holding back\n\nIf you try, try, try\n\n\n\nTry to be with me, I will try to get by\n\nSome say I’m a fool for waiting\n\nThey don’t know, this fool doesn’t mind...\n\n\n\nIf you try to be with me, I will try to get by\n\nSome say I’m a fool for waiting\n\nThey don’t know, this fool doesn’t mind\n\n\n\nThey tell me “Give it up”\n\nBut I won’t ever give it up\n\nOh, and they tel me “Give it up”\n\nBut I won’t ever give it up",
