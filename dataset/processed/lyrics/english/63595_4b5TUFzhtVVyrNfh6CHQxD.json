  "lyrics": "I wish I knew you, way back when before you were a part of my plans,\r\nI think that we would have been friends.\r\nThere's only time,to live our lives, \nYou'll be the one that's by my side.\r\nAnd I can promise you, then you'll always be my best friend.\n\nTill the end when we part, I will give you my heart, \n\nAnd will promise to love you with all that it is,\n\nAnd I will promise to be there whenever you need me, \n\nBecause you'll always be my best friend.\n\n\n\n[Repeat: x4]\n\nYou'll always be my best friend",
