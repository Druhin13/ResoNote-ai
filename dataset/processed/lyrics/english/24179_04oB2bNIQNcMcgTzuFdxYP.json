  "lyrics": "When you wake up\r\nFor when you wake up\r\nThere once was a land\r\nLittle known to your kind\r\nThere once was a land\n\nOnly we knew how to find\n\nWhere we were fire\n\nSimmer down, simmer down\n\n\n\nWhen my hands are sore\n\nFrom carrying this weight around\n\nWhen my eyes are numb\n\nAnd the air is failing on our lungs\n\nAnd weâ€™re left with a bitter taste\n\nOn our tongues\n\n\n\nYour shallow truth\n\nFractures and distorts our self views\n\nAnd my tether beat\n\nEchoes in the minds of a few\n\n\n\nFor when you wake up\n\nFor when you wake up\n\n\n\nAll light absorbed\n\nIn the shadows I will hide\n\n'Til the contour of my silhouette\n\nFades to undefined\n\nI still have fire\n\nSimmer down, simmer down\n\n\n\nYour shallow truth\n\nFractures and distorts our self views\n\nAnd my tether beat\n\nEchoes in the minds of a few\n\n\n\nYour shallow truth\n\nFractures and distorts our self views\n\nAnd my tether beat\n\nEchoes in the minds of a few\n\n\n\nFor when you wake up\n\nIf you ever wake up",
