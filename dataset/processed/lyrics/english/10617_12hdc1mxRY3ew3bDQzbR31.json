  "lyrics": "I will hold your hand until this hospital bed becomes a coffin for us\r\nAnd I will jump right in and I will be buried with you while I'm still breathing\r\nIf all the world is just a stage then I would like to die beneath the base\r\nI can finally breathe\r\nI don't feel this emptiness anymore\n\nThis heart that once was broken is all that I have left to give\n\nWe cannot stop the ship from sinking\n\nWe cannot stop my shaking hands\n\nHold onto the only love you have, cause you're nothing on your own\n\n\n\nLove can make you weak\n\nIt can steal the bones from underneath your feet\n\nIf all the world is just a stage then you must be the blood that's in my veins\n\n\n\nI can finally breathe\n\nI don't feel this emptiness anymore\n\nThis heart that once was broken is all that I have left to give\n\nWe cannot stop the ship from sinking\n\nWe cannot stop my shaking hands\n\nHold onto the only love you have, cause you're nothing on your own\n\n\n\nYou're slipping away\n\nAnd now I'm so afraid\n\nThat this is the end\n\nOf all that we have been\n\nYou're slipping away\n\nAnd now I feel the pain\n\n\n\nIf all the world is just a stage, then I would like to die in your embrace\n\n\n\nI can finally breathe\n\nI don't feel this emptiness anymore\n\nThis heart that once was broken is all that I have left to give\n\nWe cannot stop the ship from sinking\n\nWe cannot stop my shaking hands\n\nHold onto the only love you have, cause you're nothing on your own",
