  "lyrics": "The sound of your voice\r\nEchoes in my head\r\nI spend each night\r\nChasing your silhouette\r\nI call out your name, call out your name\n\nNothing has changed\n\nI stand in silence\n\nWith the memory I can't erase\n\n\n\nPhantom\n\nYou haunt me like a phantom\n\nI sing you like an anthem\n\nComing for you every night\n\n\n\nIn a dream I'm slow dancing with your ghost\n\nFeel your touch, wake up, and I'm all alone\n\nYou're a phantom\n\nYou haunt me like a phantom\n\n\n\nThe beat of your heart\n\nRunning through my veins\n\nIt's like a drum in my blood\n\nAnd I can't escape\n\n\n\nI call out your name, call out your name\n\nNothing has changed\n\nI stand in silence\n\nAnd I know I can't escape\n\n\n\nPhantom\n\nYou haunt me like a phantom\n\nI sing you like an anthem\n\nComing for you every night\n\n\n\nIn a dream I'm slow dancing with your ghost\n\nFeel your touch, wake up, and I'm all alone\n\nYou're a phantom\n\nYou haunt me like a phantom\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a dream I'm slow dancing with your ghost\n\nFeel your touch, wake up, and I'm all alone\n\nYou're a phantom\n\nYou haunt me like a phantom",
