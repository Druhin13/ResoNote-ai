  "lyrics": "Blow ill wind, blow away, find my love today\nYou're blowin' me no good, no good\nGo ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray\nAround my neighborhood and that's no good\n\nYou're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'\n\nAin't that a shame\n\nIt's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up\n\nFrom out of nowhere, when loves to blame\n\n\n\nSo ill wind, blow away, find my love today\n\nYou're blowin' me no good, no good, no good",
