  "lyrics": "Won me in a poker game\r\nLost me in a bet\r\nThen you got the nerve\r\nTo turn around and get upset\r\nMovin' on\n\nYou practice law without a license\n\nPsychology too\n\nBut your PHD is in giving me the blues\n\nMovin' on\n\n\n\nGo to third world countries\n\nKicking three-legged dogs\n\nAnd by three PM\n\nYou're living high on the hog\n\nHeld out for so long\n\nMovin' on\n\n\n\nYou may have learned to hustle\n\nBut you never learned to dance\n\nWhen you fight the law\n\nYou don't get a second chance\n\nI may be right I may be wrong\n\nMovin' on\n\n\n\nYou get away with murder\n\nYou got a way with words\n\nSpeaking in a language\n\nThat nobody's ever heard\n\nJust singin' that same old song\n\nMovin' on\n\n\n\nTen reasons to stay here\n\nEleven to leave\n\nNot waiting around\n\nFor you to give me a reprieve\n\nNo more stringing this along\n\nMovin' on",
