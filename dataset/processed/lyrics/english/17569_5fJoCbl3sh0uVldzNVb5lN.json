  "lyrics": "Not to worry on a rainy day\r\nThere's a promise it will go away\r\nWhat a joy, what a sunny day\r\nHaving you takes the sadness away\r\nWith you, everything seems to go my way\r\nHold on to a beautiful day\r\nIt will lift you up, take you to the top\r\nHold on 'cause it's here to stay\r\nTo help you get through the day, every day\r\nâ™ª\r\nNeed a reason to celebrate life\r\nThere's a promise for a sweet embrace\r\nWhat a joy, found a friend in you\r\nHaving you takes away the blues\r\nWith you, everything seems to go my way\r\nHold on to a beautiful day\r\nIt will lift you up, take you to the top\r\nHold on 'cause it's here to stay\r\nTo help you get through the day, every day\r\nLa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la\r\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la\r\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\r\nWith you, everything seems to go my way\r\nHold on to a beautiful day\r\nIt will lift you up, take you to the top\r\nHold on 'cause it's here to stay\r\nTo help you get through the day, every day\r\nHold on to a beautiful day\r\nIt will lift you up, take you to the top\r\nHold on 'cause it's here to stay\r\nTo help you get through the day, every day, every day\r\nHold on to a beautiful day\r\nIt will lift you up, take you to the top\r\nHold on 'cause it's here to stay\r\nTo help you get through the day, every day, every day",
