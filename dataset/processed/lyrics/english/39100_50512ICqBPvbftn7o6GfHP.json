  "lyrics": "We are in an age of losing\r\nAll the mayhem we are choosing\r\nTo compete in, under jealous sky\r\nIn the wake of our mistakes\r\nI tidy up the mess we've made\r\nFind destructions\n\nPaint the floor boards white\n\n\n\nI've stood up in the strongest winds\n\nAs you try to make amends\n\nYou're always promising to stay\n\nThen you push me to my limit\n\nAnd you ask me for forgiveness\n\nThen you push me to my limit\n\n\n\nOn my tiptoes in the kitchen\n\nSteal a tiny intermission\n\nFrom the constant jag of push and pull\n\nIn the distant space of my mind\n\nI imagine happier times\n\nIn the garden full of broad daylight\n\n\n\nI've stood up in the strongest winds\n\nAs you try to make amends\n\nI'm always promising to stay\n\nThen you push me to my limit\n\nAnd you ask me to forgive you\n\nThen you push me to my limit",
