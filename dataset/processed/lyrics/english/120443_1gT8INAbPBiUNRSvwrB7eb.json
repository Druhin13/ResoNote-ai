  "lyrics": "Vineland, New Jersey, farm land stretching\r\nFar as the eye can see\r\nNot much down there, but sun-scorched pastures in\r\nNineteen-fifty-three\r\nThe war is over, they came searching\r\nFor a place to be\n\nThey left the Rhineland, they lost their homeland, and\n\nAll their family\n\n\n\nLike feathers on the ocean breeze\n\nThey went spinning and tumbling 'cross the sea\n\nNever know where they'd come down\n\nOr who they'd be\n\nLike heather on the hillside\n\nThey were bruised and they were battered by the breeze\n\nSearching for a place\n\nTo be free\n\n\n\nSun burn summers and frost by winter\n\nKids were plainly dressed\n\nLeft the farmhouse when he was old enough, and\n\nHeaded out west\n\nFrom California to Southern Africa\n\nAnd all the way to France\n\nAnd on to England to meet my mother in\n\nNineteen-eighty-one\n\n\n\nA feather on the ocean breeze\n\nHe went spinning and tumbling 'cross the sea\n\nNever known where he'd come down\n\nOr who he'd be\n\nLike heather on the hillside\n\nHe was bruised and he was battered by the breeze\n\nSearching for a place\n\nTo be free\n\n\n\nOh, and like a seed\n\nThat is flying in the wind\n\nIn search of water, soil, and sun\n\nAnd the birds and the bees\n\nTo have it all along\n\n\n\nNow here I am, thirty-three years down\n\nTwo-thousand-seventeen\n\nI've seen the Rhineland, I've been to Vineland, I'm\n\nA feather on the breeze",
