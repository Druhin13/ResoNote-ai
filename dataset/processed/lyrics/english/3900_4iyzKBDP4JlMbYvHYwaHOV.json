  "lyrics": "On the first day that I saw you\r\nWalkin' home in your muddy boots\r\n'Cross the empty fields at harvest time\r\nHummin' a familiar tune\r\nI stopped and sang with you\r\nWe watched the yellow moon rise\n\nLater on outside your fence\n\nWe shared a little dance\n\nI knew I loved ya even then\n\nAnd in that autumn sky\n\nWe watched a storm go by\n\nIt's been that way ever since\n\n\n\nOh babe it's sure been a whirlwind\n\nA twirlin' twister touchin' down on the ground\n\nIn a dozen little sleepy towns\n\nBlowin' like a gale full of rain clouds and thunder\n\nWithout hearts full of hunger\n\nAnd our hopes lookin' upward once again\n\nBabe it's been a whirlwind\n\n\n\nThere were babies died and babies born\n\nFlood and drought and world war\n\nWe saw the worst years and the best\n\nIn every town another chance\n\nTryin' to build a winning hand\n\nEven when the cards were stacked against\n\nOh and I remember why we dance\n\nGentle as a passing a glance\n\nThe warmth of your breath against my cheek\n\nThen hearin' that loud thunder roll\n\nOn and on we strolled\n\nWent racin' home down rainy streets\n\n\n\nOh babe it's sure been a whirlwind\n\nA twirlin' twister touchin' down on the ground\n\nIn a dozen little sleepy towns\n\nBlowin' like a gale full of rain clouds and thunder\n\nWithout hearts full of hunger\n\nAnd our hopes lookin' upward once again\n\nBabe it's been a whirlwind\n\n\n\nOh babe it's sure been a whirlwind\n\nA twirlin' twister touchin' down on the ground\n\nIn a dozen little sleepy towns\n\nBlowin' like a gale full of rain clouds and thunder\n\nWithout hearts full of hunger\n\nAnd our hopes lookin' upward once again\n\nBabe it's been a whirlwind\n\nOh babe it's sure been a whirlwind",
