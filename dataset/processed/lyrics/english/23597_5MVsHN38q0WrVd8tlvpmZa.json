  "lyrics": "I've heard there's always one that's got to get away\r\nLet 'em go, but you know it's not that easy\r\nI never listen to what the people say\r\nI lose control, I let desire lead me\r\nMy concience aches, but it's gonna lose the fight\r\nI don't care, I give it all away tonight\n\nFor just one kiss, for just one kiss\n\nFor just one kiss, for just one\n\nOf these fantasies I've kept inside my mouth\n\nLead me on, I will follow gladly\n\nPlease, don't be mad at me because I let it show\n\nIs it so wrong to want you to hold me\n\nYou got the power that I know I can't resist\n\nMy heart is pounding and I'm bound to take the risk\n\nFor just one kiss, for just one kiss\n\nFor just one kiss, for just one kiss\n\nWhat did we lose tonight, we'll never know\n\nShould we give love a try or let it go\n\nI can't help what I do\n\nThe closer and closer I get to you\n\nMy concience aches, but it's gonna lose the fight\n\nI don't care, I give it all away tonight\n\nFor just one kiss, for just one kiss\n\nFor just one kiss, ah-ah, for just one kiss\n\n(Just one kiss, just one kiss)\n\n(Just one kiss, just one kiss)\n\n(Just one kiss) Get it on, just one\n\nJust one kiss (just one kiss)\n\n(Just one kiss, just one kiss)\n\n(Just one kiss, just one kiss)",
