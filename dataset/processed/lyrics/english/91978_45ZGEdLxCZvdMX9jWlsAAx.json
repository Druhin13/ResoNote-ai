  "lyrics": "Some guy skipped in front of me\r\nCan't believe I paid an entry fee\r\nAnd I don’t even got the energy\r\nTo smile for a selfie\r\nAnd I know that I should go home\r\nBut I'm still standing here so\n\nI guess one more for the road\n\nI wanna raise a toast so\n\n\n\nThis one’s for the sparklers\n\nDudes wearing shades in the darkness\n\nBut hats off to the DJ\n\nSame song twice in an evening (1,2,3)\n\n\n\nOh, save me (Save me), can't take it (Take it)\n\nI don't belong in this club\n\nOne dance (One dance), no chance (No chance)\n\n'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (Oh)\n\nI was waiting in line for an hour\n\nJust to get in now, I wanna get out 'cause (Oh)\n\nI'm jaded (I’m jaded), can’t fake it (Can't fake it)\n\nI don’t belong in this club, no\n\n\n\nHopped out of the Uber (Uber)\n\nI was feeling myself (Goddamn)\n\nHad the polo with the bolo (I did)\n\nWith some eel on the belt (Hoo)\n\nWalked up to the bouncer (Hey, what's up man?)\n\nWhole squad on stealth (I'm Macklemore)\n\nHe said, \"Mackler, who?\" (It's me)\n\nYou gotta wait like everybody else\n\nShoulda stayed on the sofa\n\nForgot I hate being social\n\nAnd I miss my ex-girl\n\nThis Drake song making me ’motional (Girl, you hurt my feelings)\n\nI'm feeling awkward as hell (Uh-huh)\n\nI only came here to dance (Wassup?)\n\nThe DJ ain't playing the cuts (No)\n\nAnd what do I do with my hands? (It's awkward)\n\nRoll with the punches and hold my Red Bull up\n\nAnd I toast the nights like this that I probably won't remember much\n\n'Bout to pull that Irish goodbye, grab my stuff, 'bout to cut\n\nAnd the DJ yells, \"Macklemore in the house tonight\"\n\nAh, fuck\n\n\n\nOh, save me (Save me), can't take it (Take it)\n\nI don't belong in this club (Club)\n\nOne dance (One dance), no chance (No chance)\n\n'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (Oh)\n\nI was waiting in line for an hour\n\nJust to get in now, I wanna get out 'cause (Oh)\n\nI'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (Can't fake it)\n\nI don't belong in this club\n\n\n\nAnd to think that I've waited all week (No)\n\nTo get someone's drink spilled over me (I)\n\nI don't care if the Uber's on surge (No I don't, no)\n\nI'd do anything to get out of this club\n\n\n\nSave me, can't take it, no\n\nI don't belong in this club\n\nOne dance, no chance\n\n'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (Oh)\n\nI was waiting in line for an hour\n\nJust to get in now, I wanna get out 'cause (Oh)\n\nI'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (Can't fake it)\n\nI don't belong in this club",
