  "lyrics": "It's been a while since we crossed paths\r\nI thought I saw you in an hourglass\r\nI’m not sure where the time has gone\r\nBut I know it's been too long\r\nWe used to say we'd never change\r\nNow we’re trying not to show our age\n\nI know, you said you needed space\n\nSo, you moved all the furniture around this place\n\n\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don't feel like home\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don't feel like home\n\n\n\nIt's getting dark in sunset park\n\nI see the marks on your broken heart\n\nI'm trying not to let it get to me\n\nBut it's hard with all our history\n\nLeaving town while the city sleeps\n\nYou know, I always had bigger dreams\n\nI keep looking in the rearview mirror\n\nYou know, I wasn't happy here\n\n\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don't feel like home\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don’t feel like home\n\n\n\nAnd now I’m running to you, trying to find myself\n\nBut I don't even know where to start\n\nI can’t sit tight as I wait, I've keeping nothing the same\n\n'Cause I don't even know who you are\n\n\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don’t feel like home\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don't feel like home\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don't feel like home\n\nOh, I hate this feeling\n\nYou don't feel like home\n\n\n\nFeel like home",
