  "lyrics": "Sun went down, sun went down, over Pompeii\r\nOn both sides the vow was broken\r\nOh my my, I'm the one\r\nTryin' to hide this damage done\r\nOne day, all our secrets will be spoken\n\nAs we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen\n\nTimes I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah\n\nUnderneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything\n\nLike we were never close\n\n\n\nDon't you worry baby\n\nNo sense tryin' to change it\n\nI'ma strike these matches\n\nNever had control\n\nI'm ready to let go\n\nWas I foolin' myself\n\nI'ma spread these ashes\n\nNever had control\n\nI'm ready, I'm ready\n\nI'm ready to let go\n\n\n\nSun went down, sun went down, over Pompeii\n\nOn holy ground our vows were broken\n\nWe met up we broke bread\n\nI was blue, your dress was red, ain't it strange?\n\nWe both knew this day was comin'\n\n\n\nAs we slow danced, I became your statue, frozen\n\nTimes I wonder, are we just a puff of smoke? Yeah\n\nUnderneath this bed of ashes still withholding everything\n\nLike we were never close\n\n\n\nDon't you worry baby\n\nNo sense tryin' to change it\n\nI'ma strike these matches\n\nNever had control\n\nI'm ready to let go\n\nWas I foolin' myself\n\nI'ma spread these ashes\n\nNever had control\n\nI'm ready, I'm ready\n\nI'm ready to let go\n\n\n\nDon't you worry baby\n\nNo sense tryin' to change it\n\nI'ma strike these matches\n\nNever had control\n\nI'm ready to let go\n\nWas I foolin' myself\n\nI'ma spread these ashes\n\nNever had control\n\nI'm ready, I'm ready\n\nI'm ready to let go",
