  "lyrics": "Welcome to your life\r\nThere's no turning back\r\nEven while we sleep\r\nWe will find you\r\nActing on your best behavior\r\nTurn your back on mother nature\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world\n\n\n\nIt's my own design\n\nIt's my own remorse\n\nHelp me to decide\n\nHelp me make the most\n\nOf freedom and of pleasure\n\nNothing ever lasts forever\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world\n\n\n\nThere's a room where the light won't find you\n\nHolding hands while the walls come tumbling down\n\nWhen they do I'll be right behind you\n\n\n\nSo glad we've almost made it\n\nSo sad they had to fade it\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world\n\n\n\n\n\nI can't stand this indecision\n\nMarried with a lack of vision\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world\n\n\n\nSay that you'll never, never, never, never need it\n\nOne headline - why believe it?\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world\n\n\n\nAll for freedom and for pleasure\n\nNothing ever lasts forever\n\nEverybody wants to rule the world",
