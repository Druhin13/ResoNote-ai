  "lyrics": "I'm a man on fire\r\nIt's a burning thing\r\nIt'll burn on forever\r\nIf you feed me baby\r\nI'm a man on fire\r\nAn eternal flame\n\nIt'll burn on forever\n\nIf you feed me baby, oh...\n\n\n\nGotta be a place to go in the midnight hour\n\nHeart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power\n\nThe feeling's got me\n\nI don't know what it means\n\nI know it must be wrong\n\nBut when you love somebody you dream, and I dream\n\nI save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come\n\nAnd you're there, and you're gone\n\nAnd I'm alive for you\n\nAnd my love keeps hanging on\n\n\n\nThere is no life\n\nNo reason to go on believing in the stronger love\n\nThere is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying\n\nI'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world\n\nTogether we are strong in love\n\nAnd when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be\n\nAnd me, I'm a man on fire\n\n\n\nCHORUS\n\n\n\nReady when the lightning strikes and he deed is done\n\nI'm not a beginner\n\nBut I'm a sinner when the heat is on\n\nNothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need\n\nWoman, when you need somebody\n\nA woman with a face and a body, you dream, and I dream\n\n\n\nI save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come\n\nAnd you're there and you're gone\n\nAnd I'm alive for you\n\nAnd my love keeps hanging on\n\n\n\nThere is no life\n\nNo reason to go on believing in the stronger love\n\nThere is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying\n\nI'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world\n\nTogether we are strong enough\n\nAnd when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can me\n\nAnd me, I'm a man on fire\n\n\n\nCHORUS",
