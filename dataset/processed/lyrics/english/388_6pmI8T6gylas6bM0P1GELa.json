  "lyrics": "There's no rush when you don't belong\r\nTurns out we don't all fight like dogs in the end\r\nMost of us want to roll out, roll under the grass\r\nYou an endless cartoon, no bridge in your song\r\nSpirulina won't kill my heartbreak\n\nI was a dreamer when I learned to take\n\nIn between her and a fireplace\n\nThere are factors that condition me something and can I pay?\n\n(Pay)\n\n\n\nAnd the blank ones cartwheel out of the furnace\n\nThe mold never cracked, you see\n\nThe girls never swarmed me\n\nStill sleep on their backs\n\nUnderstood a fact\n\nWhen you spoke in all your marvelous ideologies\n\nThe world is always at ease, at ease, at ease\n\nDon't you see?\n\n\n\nAnd the deaths on the highways\n\nFrom drink in the casinos\n\nFeel so natural\n\nEvery day a dice roll, everywhere you gamble\n\nWearing something I can handle\n\nAnd the world [?] savior\n\nWe are taught to savor everyone else's failures\n\nEndlessly\n\n\n\nEven the greatest, the very very greatest\n\nGave up, tapped out\n\nTold all you fuckers to lie down\n\nYet still you found cathedrals of deceit\n\nWhere does the robber go\n\nWhere does the robber go to repent?\n\nTell me\n\n\n\nTell anyone you wouldn't buy a round\n\nFor your best friend\n\nSee it trickle down on you\n\nI don't depend, there you go, then\n\nBuy another round\n\nBuy infinitum\n\nBye, there you go and bye\n\nIt's such a happy sound\n\n\n\nThere is no rush when you don't belong\n\nTurns out we don't all fight like dogs in the end\n\nMost of us want to roll out, roll under the grass\n\nYou endless cartoon, no bridge in your song\n\nMake me wonder again\n\nOr make me learn to pretend\n\nMake me wonder again\n\nOr make me learn to pretend\n\nMake me wonder again\n\nOr make me learn to pretend",
