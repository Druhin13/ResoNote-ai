  "lyrics": "Let's all dissolve in a blanket\r\nFade away like smoke off cigarettes\r\nWonder what it's like on the other side\r\nI wanna feel alive, I wanna feel alive all the time\r\nEvery one disappears some day\n\nYou've worn out your morning clothes\n\nWeak-stitched with plume to holes\n\nNothing will hold you close\n\nEveryone, have you thought about balance?\n\n\n\nThe idea of your lake\n\nStanding verse stabbing\n\nI think about it everyday\n\nThere's only so much strength that could withhold the weight\n\n\n\nLet's all dissolve in a blanket\n\nFade away like smoke off cigarettes\n\nWonder what it's like on the other side\n\nI wanna feel alive, if I close my eyes will it reverse the light?\n\nFocus on one thing at a time\n\n\n\nPlease unwind, please unwind\n\nI want to feel alive, all the time\n\nI want to feel alive, all the time\n\n\n\nI must have lost my train of thought\n\nMy head derailed before I could even walk\n\nA thought I never knew I thought\n\nA thought I never knew I thought\n\nBroadcast the crawl\n\n\n\nReflective monologue in a situation that doesn't help you\n\nRaw perspective on the story, how one became two\n\nMy diaphragm collapsing at the sound of each and every move\n\nI still miss you, I still miss you\n\n\n\nYou place your hand on the glass, try to get through\n\nA mirror is only a mirror if you look into\n\nMy diaphragm collapsing at the sound of each and every move\n\nI still miss you, I still miss you, I still miss you",
