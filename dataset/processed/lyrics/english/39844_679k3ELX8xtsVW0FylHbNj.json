  "lyrics": "Don't run away, cause I don't know where you go\nI don't want to know\nDon't follow me in, cause I don't know where I'm going\nOr how long i'll be\n\nLiving in a dark tower, getting darker by the hour\n\nWill I wake up from a dark, dark daydream\n\nNothing can wake me from myself\n\nNot you, or no one else\n\n\n\nDon't wait for me, girl, cause I don't know what I'm after\n\nYou, or my career\n\nDon't say it's the end, cause I could not take it\n\nDo you know me still?\n\n\n\nLiving in a dark tower, getting darker by the hour\n\nWill I wake up from a dark, dark daydream\n\nNothing can wake me from myself, not you or nobody else\n\n\n\nAhhhhh ahhhhh\n\nAhhhhh ahhhhh\n\n\n\nLiving in a dark tower, getting darker by the hour\n\nWill I wake up from a dark, dark daydream\n\nNothing can wake me from myself\n\n\n\nLiving in a dark tower, getting darker by the hour\n\nWill I wake up from a dark, dark daydream\n\nNothing can wake me from myself, not you or no one else",
