  "lyrics": "You start looking mean\r\nNeed something to ruin\r\nCarved out your name\r\nNot enough for you\r\nI remember when\r\nThere was nothing to take your mind off it\n\nI know all the ways to act like a fool\n\nI needed you\n\n\n\nIn other words, other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me\n\nIn other words, other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me\n\n\n\nYou think that you can\n\nI take up so much room\n\nIt's the best I can bend\n\nTo try to make some space for two\n\nIt spins around us in\n\nA direction to come unwind\n\nWhile I needed you\n\nIt was never a choice of mine\n\n\n\nIn other words, other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me\n\nIn other words, other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me\n\n\n\nAin't it hard enough for me to ask\n\nWell, it takes all of me\n\n\n\nIn other words, in other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me\n\nIn other words, other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me\n\nIn other words, in other ways\n\nI want you to be there for me",
