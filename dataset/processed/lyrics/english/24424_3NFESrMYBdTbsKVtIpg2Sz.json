  "lyrics": "I want a girl who looks good in the daylight\r\nNeed her to know about sorrow in the sunshine\r\nShe didn't care because I need to fall asleep\r\nShe did some study and she analyzed me\r\nYou look so sorry\n\nI want a girl with a head like hollow\n\nDead end dreams and all the solace in the shallow\n\nShe emptied her inside well, there's nothing left to show\n\nShe never needs me, so I'm better off alone\n\nYou look so sorry\n\n\n\nDaylight is starting to rise\n\nYou are all you ever wanted to be\n\nDaylight is coming out the dark\n\nYou are all you ever wanted\n\n\n\nI want to go through a vault that opens\n\nDig to the depths or you will never see the surface\n\nHe'd say I'd pause and see the sun, pleased to see it\n\nShe's never anything I don't want her to be\n\nYou'll be so sorry\n\n\n\nDaylight is starting to rise\n\nYou are all you ever wanted too\n\nDaylight is coming out the dark\n\nYou are all you've ever wanted too",
