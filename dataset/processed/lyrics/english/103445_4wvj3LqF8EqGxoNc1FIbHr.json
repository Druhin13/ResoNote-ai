  "lyrics": "I'm counting down, I'm headed out\r\nChasing a cosmic constellation in the stars\r\nThat speed of sound can't catch me now\r\nAnd by the time you see me I won't be around\r\nHouston, we up, Earth ain't enough\n\nYou can call me rocket girl\n\nOh, Major Tom, you ain't so tough\n\nWatch me fly across the universe\n\nIt's T minus one, ooh\n\nYou can call me rocket girl\n\nIt's T minus one, ooh\n\nWatch me fly across the universe\n\n\n\nI'm on a roll, I'm leaving home\n\nBe strollin' down those neon lights all in the road\n\nMy speed of light, I'll blow your mind\n\nI'll be the feeling you'll be dreaming of tonight\n\n\n\nHouston, we up, Earth ain't enough\n\nYou can call me rocket girl\n\nOh, Major Tom, you ain't so tough\n\nWatch me fly across the universe\n\nIt's T minus one, ooh\n\nYou can call me rocket girl\n\nIt's T minus one, ooh\n\nWatch me fly across the universe\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's T minus one, ooh\n\nYou can call me rocket girl\n\nIt's T minus one, ooh\n\nWatch me fly across the universe\n\nIt's T minus one\n\nIt's T minus one",
