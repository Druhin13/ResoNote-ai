  "lyrics": "I want to swim in your current\r\nCarry me out, up and away.\r\nI want to float\r\nOn every word you say.\r\nI want to be underneath your weather,\n\nEvery could and ray of sun,\n\nI want to float\n\nIn between every one.\n\nI want to sink down like a stone.\n\nYou never lost me you never broke.\n\nI want to be adrift on your radio.\n\nOn take me under, take me home.\n\n\n\nI want to be, all of a sudden\n\nEvery wave and undertow.\n\nI want to float\n\nEverywhere I go.",
