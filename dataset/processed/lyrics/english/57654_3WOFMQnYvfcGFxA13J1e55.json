  "lyrics": "She's always hot on a oregano\r\nSubway go, let's go\r\nTo nowhere, she don't care\r\nAs long as we go\r\nMy polaroid queen\n\nFor the last few nights you dominated my dreams\n\nTurn to real cheese\n\nYou couldn't keep them on\n\nThough we were 18\n\n\n\nWe're now somewhere in the field\n\nStaring at the stars\n\nThen she looks over here\n\nSays let's steal a car, and go\n\nJump Brooklyn!\n\n\n\nNow I'm on the road\n\nLights flashing, she been blasting\n\nThe radio, the radio\n\nTaking it slow\n\nFuck that, she's all about the vertigo\n\n\n\nMy polaroid queen, cuts really nachos from the vending machine\n\nShe's making a scene\n\nCandle will creep\n\nIn a birthday suit you're dressing up for me\n\nThe American dream\n\n\n\nWe're now somewhere in the field\n\nStaring at the stars\n\nThen she looks over here\n\nSays let's take the bar and go\n\nJump Brooklyn!\n\n\n\nIf you don't know\n\nHeads down this bitch\n\nIs the baddest bitch I know\n\nLook at her go, where the Brooklyn is\n\nAll of the flow, she's the baddest bitch I know\n\n\n\nMy polaroid queen\n\nFor the last few nights you dominated my dreams\n\nTurn to real cheese\n\nYou couldn't keep them on\n\nThough we were 18\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm somewhere in the street\n\nDrunk outside the bar, oh oh oh,\n\nAnd she's sober as can be\n\nStole my fucking car\n\nDamn!",
