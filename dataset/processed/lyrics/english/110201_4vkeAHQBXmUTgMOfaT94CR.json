  "lyrics": "This is the story of a runaway\r\nWith no way home and no way out\r\nI threw the best of me away\r\nI had my chance, it's too late now\r\nToo far gone and too ashamed\r\nTo think that You'd still know my name\n\nBut love refused to let my story end that way\n\n\n\nYou didn't wait for me to find my way to You\n\nI couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to\n\nYou came running after me\n\nWhen anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst\n\nLove moved first\n\nOh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohhh, oh-oh-ohh\n\n\n\nWhat kind of grace, relentless grace\n\nWould chase this rebel down\n\nCrawl into this prisoner's cage\n\nTake my hand and pull me out\n\nYou knew I couldn't make the change\n\nSo You became the change in me\n\nAnd now I live to tell the story\n\nOf the God who rescues\n\n\n\nYou didn't wait for me to find my way to You\n\nI couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to\n\nYou came running after me\n\nWhen anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst\n\nLove moved first\n\n\n\nFrom the throne to the manger\n\nFrom a manger to the grave\n\nYour cross is the proof\n\nLove made the first move\n\nFrom a grave meant to keep You\n\nTo a stone rolled away\n\nYour cross is the proof\n\nLove made the first move\n\nI remember where You found me\n\nI'm amazed by where I stand\n\nYour cross is the proof\n\nThat love made the first move\n\n\n\nYou didn't wait for me to find my way to You\n\nI couldn't cross that distance even if I wanted to\n\nYou came running after me\n\nWhen anybody else would've turned and left me at my worst\n\nLove moved first\n\nOh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh\n\nLove moved first",
