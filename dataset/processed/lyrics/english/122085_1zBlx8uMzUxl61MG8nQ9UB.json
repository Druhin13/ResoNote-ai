(Ayy)\n\nI can make you go night, night\n\nI can make you go night, night\n\nYou be down for whatever\n\nWhen I pour it up, I don't measure (Hey)\n\nSay you love me five-ever\n\nOur love was sudden\n\nMake this bitch jump like a step team\n\nSee my diamonds, can you say, \"Wet dream\"?\n\nFirst let me close the bamboo blinds\n\nShe don't say my name but she gotta scream it\n\n\n\nDancin' in the strobe lights\n\nWith your eyes on me\n\nI don't need to know your sign\n\nDo you see somethin' you like?\n\n\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\n\n\nHey, yeah!\n\nI can't take your call, I need face time\n\nRode the metro, took the bassline\n\nTook all the good stuff, now it ain't mine (Hey)\n\nYou've been gone for forever\n\nHow much I miss your love, I can't measure (No)\n\nKnow you got another special\n\nBut just for this night, go up a level (Hey)\n\nWhen we pop outside, let you take lead (Lead)\n\nShe just treat the dick like a jetski (Skeet, skeet)\n\nI was posted up like a set piece (Piece)\n\nWhere you get these from? I can't take these (Down, yeah)\n\nI'm the one, number one\n\nI've done finally found my home between the moon and the sun\n\nEvery time we come around, just know it move and it run\n\nMan it's crazy, all my youngins gotta move with a gun\n\nDrop it down, drop it down, way you do it\n\nKnow you come from out of town\n\nI've been stuck off in my ways, I've been workin' on it\n\nOn some on my own time, don't be waitin' on me\n\nI've been zoned out in the days, it's an air burst\n\nI've been livin' through a maze on my Fred Durst\n\nGet that shit from out my way, make the mess worse\n\nTo the A.M., I make my rounds\n\nNot a peep, don't hear a sound\n\nNow you know if you ain't know it, now you know\n\n\n\nWonder what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nInto, I know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nInto, I know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into (Hey)\n\n\n\nDancin' in the strobe lights\n\nWith your eyes on me\n\nI don't need to know your sign\n\nDo you see somethin' you like?\n\n\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into\n\nI know what you're into",
