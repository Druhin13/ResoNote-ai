Who is this?)\r\nHitmaka\r\nSounds\r\n(Wait, you actually remembered my number)\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nRight, I just wanna taste it, let me slip inside\n\nYou know I'm in the 305, all night\n\n\n\nYou know I'ma need you to just sing to my mic, right now\n\nTurn your drip into my drain, turn these bright lights down\n\nI don't wanna sound like I'm evil, but I'm coming for that weed too (skrrt)\n\nThought I was done after round 1, but you know I'ma need 2\n\n\n\nOh my God, stop please\n\nI'm not gassing out this plane\n\nLanding, fuck you in that Wraith\n\nI got big bills in my bank\n\nOh my God, stop please\n\nI might fuck on you all day\n\nEat that pussy, where's my cream?\n\nBet you lick it off my face\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nRight, I just wanna taste it, let me slip inside\n\nYou know I'm in the 305, all night\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\n\n\nAyy, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\nThere's not anything that I'd rather do\n\nThan to leave the club and go home with you\n\nWhat's that? Just might, good pipe, good night\n\nWake up, sunrise, best live\n\n\n\nOh my God, stop please\n\nI'm not gassing out this plane\n\nLanding, fuck you in that Wraith\n\nI got big bills in my bank\n\nOh my God, stop please\n\nI might fuck on you all day\n\nEat that pussy, where's my cream?\n\nBet you lick it off my face\n\n\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nRight, I just wanna taste it, let me slip inside\n\nYou know I'm in the 305, all night\n\nBaby, I'm wasted\n\nHow could I get your number right?\n\nHow could I get your number right?",
