  "lyrics": "You'll find me screaming at the sun\r\nIt singes my eyes\r\nThe plan I devise, in this chess game to shatter the crook\r\nAnd now the queen takes the rook\r\nYou think that you can read me like a book\r\nBut you mistook the pushback, skull crack, now I take the pawn\n\nThe pattern's sliding off and now the bishop's gone\n\nWoe this land\n\nIt bares my hand\n\nOf the final command\n\n\n\nThey see you blinded us, reminded us of all that's ugly\n\nAnd if you let it in, the predator will leave you bloody\n\n\n\nSo take a look into my eyes\n\nAnd sharpen your gaze\n\nSharpen the blades 'cause the stakes have been raised\n\nKiss the ring\n\nAnd now the knight takes the king\n\nNow the rank and file is to bring\n\nThe sacrificing, upside, downside, give me all your guns\n\nI'm fucking crazy, oh my mind is lost or won?\n\nHold your breath\n\nThese wounds are fresh\n\nOf this mate that I check\n\n\n\nThey see you blinded us, reminded us of all that's ugly\n\nAnd if you let it in, the predator will leave you bloody\n\n\n\nSo we close\n\nOff the din outside the window\n\nNo we won't\n\nNormalize the tyrannizing\n\nYou'll find me screaming at the sun\n\nUntil my sould dies\n\n\n\nYou'll find me screaming now\n\nThey see you blinded us, reminded us of all that's ugly",
