  "lyrics": "You're something like a summer breeze\r\nMoving through the eucalyptus trees\r\nThe taste of Holiness like, like\r\nLike Heavenâ€™s honeycomb drop up on my tongue yeah\r\nI need to speak my peace\n\nI need to speak my due\n\nI need to beat the beast\n\nI need to tame the bull\n\nI stood in line for swine\n\nAnd I still cast my pearls\n\nI used to go to church for girls\n\nAnd realized the hurtful world was even there\n\nAnd know I can't escape it but you everywhere\n\nAnd now I know I'm not alone\n\nMy wife is here, my niece is here\n\nMy sister's here, they're tryna go\n\nI'm running late, my stomach folds\n\nI curl up, I'm tryna hurl\n\nI stuck it up\n\nIt's funny cause I still go to church for girls\n\nGrateful for my wife's patience\n\nI could go from over-working\n\nTo living life on vacation\n\nI tend to be extreme\n\nShe sees and gives me balance\n\nI seem to find the challenge\n\nWith turning off these cameras and these screens\n\nFar from perfect but I still believe\n\nThat God is who he says he is\n\nAnd I am just a seed like my son\n\nInterruptions well received when they come\n\nAin't rich, ain't perfect\n\nBut I'm glad what we've become\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nYeah you bring me to life\n\nWhen you show me the light\n\nYeah you bring me to life\n\nWhen you show me the light\n\nThere's nothing sweeter than you\n\n\n\nWe're starting to have these talks\n\nMore frequent than just in song\n\nI'm thinking it won't be long\n\nI'm living out what you taught\n\nThat El Shaddai, Adonai",
