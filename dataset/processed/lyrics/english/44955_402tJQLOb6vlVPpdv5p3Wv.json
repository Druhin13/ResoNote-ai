  "lyrics": "There's nothing on Earth that a girl could do\r\nThe very first minute that I laid my eyes on you\r\nOn you\r\nTurned sheets to the wind, I was all confused\r\nLike burning my money, nothing left to lose, I knew\r\nI was doomed\n\n\n\nAn attraction I just can't explain\n\nBut I knew I was never gonna be the same\n\nI'd be lying if I said that I always chose what was good\n\nSo where we're gonna go in your Shelby '68?\n\n\n\nI know you're gonna break my heart\n\nWhen I get in your car\n\nOh, the trouble I'm in when we take that spin\n\nYeah, I'm in\n\nI know there'll be hell to pay\n\nBaby, I just can't wait\n\nOh, I'm gonna get high when I take that ride\n\nIn your Shelby '68\n\n\n\nI was rolling with my very own Steve McQueen\n\nWhen you were hitting that road and I was living the dream\n\nSo it seemed\n\nLike a diamond burried in the dirt and rough, yeah\n\nI knew it was wrong but it felt so right to me\n\nCan't you see?\n\n\n\nAn attraction I just can't explain\n\nBut I knew I was never gonna be the same\n\nI'd be lying if I said that I always chose what was good\n\nSo where we're gonna go in that Shelby '68?\n\n\n\nI know you're gonna break my heart\n\nWhen I get in your car\n\nOh, the trouble I'm in when we take that spin\n\nYeah, I'm in\n\nI know there'll be hell to pay\n\nBaby, I just can't wait\n\nOh, I'm gonna get high when I take that ride\n\nIn your Shelby '68\n\n\n\nI just can't wait\n\n\n\nBurn rubber baby, get on with this show\n\nI'll take a ride if it's your rodeo\n\nThe horses are wild and I'll cry, but I'm ready to go\n\n(Let's go)\n\nLongest of days and the starriest nights\n\nRocking the road and the moon and those lights\n\nNo destination, we're racing baby, just drive\n\n(Drive)\n\nTake me away in your Shelby '68\n\n\n\nI know you're gonna break my heart\n\nWhen I get in your car\n\nOh, the trouble I'm in when we take that spin\n\nYeah, I'm in\n\nI know there'll be hell to pay\n\nBaby, I just can't wait\n\nOh, I'm gonna get high when I take that ride\n\nIn your Shelby '68\n\n\n\nOoh, I just can't wait (oooh)\n\nThere'll be hell to pay\n\nTake me away (oh)\n\nShelby '68",
