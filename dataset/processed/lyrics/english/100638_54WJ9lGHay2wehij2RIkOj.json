  "lyrics": "I remember suffering with every single word they're saying\r\nI could always feel them, I could always feel them\r\nAnd even when I ran away, the voices in my head they're staying\r\nI could always hear them, I could always hear them\r\nAlone inside\n\nI wish that I could die\n\n\n\nAll this hate will burn your life down\n\nAll the pain you cause your own suffering\n\nTell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself\n\nDo you even see it all?\n\nAll this hate you chose will call your life away\n\nDo you even see it all?\n\n\n\nAll your little shameful looks were buried in my heart like hooks\n\nI didn't wanna be you, you told me I was evil\n\nAnd when I finally ran away just trying to escape the pain\n\nI wanted to believe that I belonged somewhere on my own\n\n\n\nAll this hate will burn your life down\n\nAll the pain you cause your own suffering\n\nTell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself\n\nDo you even see it all?\n\nAll this hate you chose will call your life away\n\nDo you even see it all?\n\n\n\nAlone inside\n\nI wish that I could die\n\nAlone inside\n\nI wish that I could die\n\nAlone inside\n\nAlone inside\n\n\n\nAll this hate will burn your life down\n\nAll the pain you cause your own suffering\n\nTell me when you look in the mirror and talk to yourself\n\nDo you even see it all?\n\nAll this hate you chose will call your life away\n\nDo you even see it all?",
