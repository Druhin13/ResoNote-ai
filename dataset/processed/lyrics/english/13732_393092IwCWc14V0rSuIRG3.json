I'm so afraid. \n\nBeing raped again, and again, and again. \n\nI know I will die alone. \n\nBut loved. \n\n\n\nYou live long enough to hear the sound of guns, \n\nlong enough to find yourself screaming every night, \n\nlong enough to see your friends betray you. \n\n\n\nFor years I've been strapped unto this altar. \n\nNow I only have 3 minutes and counting. \n\nI just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for.? \n\n\n\nPart IV: ?Dark Passion Play? \n\n\n\nSecond robber to the right of Christ \n\nCut in half - infanticide \n\nThe world will rejoice today \n\nAs the crows feast on the rotting poet \n\n\n\nEveryone must bury their own \n\nNo pack to bury the heart of stone \n\nNow he's home in hell, serves him well \n\nSlain by the bell, tolling for his farewell \n\n\n\nThe morning dawned upon his altar \n\nRemains of the dark passion play \n\nPerformed by his friends without shame \n\nSpitting on his grave as they came \n\n\n\nGet away, run away, fly away \n\nLead me astray to dreamer's hideaway \n\nI cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more \n\nI cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world \n\nForgive me \n\nI have but two faces \n\nOne for the world \n\nOne for God \n\nSave me \n\nI cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more \n\nI cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world \n\n\n\n\"Today, in the year of our Lord 2005, \n\nTuomas was called from the cares of the world. \n\nHe stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day. \n\nThe music he wrote had too long been without silence. \n\nHe was found naked and dead, \n\nWith a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text.? \n\n\n\nSave me\n\n\n\nPart V: ?Mother & Father? \n\n\n\nBe still, my son \n\nYou're home \n\nOh when did you become so cold? \n\nThe blade will keep on descending \n\nAll you need is to feel my love \n\n\n\nSearch for beauty, find your shore \n\nTry to save them all, bleed no more \n\nYou have such oceans within \n\nIn the end \n\nI will always love you \n\n\n\nThe beginning",
