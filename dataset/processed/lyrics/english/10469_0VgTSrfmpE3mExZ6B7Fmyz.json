  "lyrics": "We are two ships passing\r\nHow long will this last\r\nWe haven't had the time to work it out\r\nSitting in the backseat\r\nWho knows where our paths meet\n\nYou keep shouting \"we gotta work it out\"\n\n\n\nYou gotta believe me when I say I know\n\n(Gotta work it out)\n\nYou aren't riding on this wave alone\n\n(Gotta work it out)\n\nGotta believe me when I say I know\n\n(Gotta work it out)\n\nI already know, I know, I know, I know\n\n\n\nYell all that you want to\n\nWe'll yell it right back to you\n\nBack and forth until we tire out\n\n\n\nTemper into tempest\n\nWashes off the madness\n\nWe're still left with figuring shit out\n\n\n\nYou gotta believe me when I say I know\n\n(Gotta work it out)\n\nYou aren't riding on this wave alone\n\n(Gotta work it out)\n\nGotta believe me when I say I know\n\n(Gotta work it out)\n\nI already know, I know, I know, I know\n\n\n\nThe seeds of what you say all beg for reason\n\nPlant them deep so we can disregard them\n\nJust get out of your pretty little head\n\nI'm just waking up to get back into bed\n\nThe seeds of what you say all beg for reason\n\nPlant them deeply so we can release them\n\nListening to every word you say\n\nYou're just waking up to get back into bed\n\n\n\nYou aren't riding on this wave alone\n\nYou aren't riding on this wave alone\n\nYou aren't riding on this wave alone\n\nI already know, I know, I know, I know\n\nYou gotta believe me when I say I know\n\nI already know, I know, I know, I know\n\nAlright\n\nI already know, I know, I know, I know",
