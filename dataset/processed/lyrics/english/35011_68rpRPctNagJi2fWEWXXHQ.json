  "lyrics": "If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been\nOne look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.\nPerhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.\nIf you could see me now, you'd find me being brave\nAnd trying awfully hard to make my tears behave\nBut that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.\n\n\n\nYou'll happen my way on some mem'rable day\n\nAnd the month will be May for a while.\n\nI'll try to smile but can I play the part\n\nWithout my heart behind the smile?\n\n\n\nThe way I feel for you I never could disguise\n\nThe look of love is written plainly in my eyes.\n\nI think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",
