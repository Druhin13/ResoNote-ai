  "lyrics": "I walk through the valley of the shadow of death\r\nCaught a glimpse of Heaven when I couldn't catch my breath\r\nI felt His presence in the darkest of days\r\nI've asked for direction, and I've been shown the way\r\nAnd I believe when I pray, somebody hears\n\nWhen I fall on my knees, my words aren't fallin' on deaf ears\n\nAnd He has the answers when the answers can't be found\n\nI know without a doubt what goes up comes down\n\n\n\nI've been lead from temptation, though I was standin' at it's door\n\nDelivered from evil when I could run no more\n\nI've seen the eyes of God through the eyes of a child\n\nI've thanked Him for my blessings and I've felt it when he smiled\n\n\n\nAnd I believe when I pray, somebody hears\n\nWhen I fall on my knees, my words aren't fallin' on deaf ears\n\nAnd He has the answers when the answers can't be found\n\nI know without a doubt what goes up comes down\n\n\n\nI raise my hands when my burdens are too heavy\n\nAnd He lifts me up just like that cross he didn't have to carry\n\n\n\nAnd He has the answers when the answers can't be found\n\nI know without a doubt what goes up comes down\n\n\n\nMy greatest prayers will be answered\n\nWhen he returns to claim his crown\n\nI know without a doubt what goes up comes down (I believe)\n\nWhat goes up must come down (I believe)",
