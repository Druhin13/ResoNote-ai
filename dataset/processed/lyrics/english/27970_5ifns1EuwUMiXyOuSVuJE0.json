  "lyrics": "They said no way, it'll never happen\r\nNo chance that I would ever settle down\r\nBut if I did it would take a woman\r\nStrong enough to sort this ole boy out\r\nAnd girl I know I didn't make it easy on you\n\nI was a burning building but you still walked right through\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm holding you in my arms\n\nAnd you're looking like an angel\n\nWhen I hear your voice, I run\n\nAnd put the world away a minute\n\n'Cause I only want you in it\n\nGirl you're everything I want\n\n\n\nWhere you kiss me baby I can't get enough\n\nBut the biggest crime that you ever committed\n\nIs you got this boy in love\n\nYeah you've got this boy in love\n\n\n\nIt took so long, I couldn't see it\n\nI get so stubborn I can't find my way\n\nBut I'm getting better and you're the reason\n\nI wake up smiling every single day\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm holding you in my arms\n\nAnd you're looking like an angel\n\nWhen I hear your voice, I run\n\nAnd put the world away a minute\n\n'Cause I only want you in it\n\nGirl you're everything I want\n\n\n\nWhere you kiss me baby I can't get enough\n\nBut the biggest crime that you ever committed\n\nIs you got this boy in love\n\nYeah you've got this boy in love\n\n\n\nAnd every time your car pulls in\n\nMy door flies open once again\n\nAnd I still can't believe that you're mine\n\nSo let's rule the world, let's set the date\n\nJust talking 'bout it I can't wait\n\nTo be with you forever\n\nTo stay with you forever\n\n\n\nAnd now I'm holding you in my arms\n\nAnd you're looking like an angel\n\nWhen I hear your voice, I run\n\nAnd put the world away a minute\n\n'Cause I only want you in it\n\nGirl you're everything I want\n\n\n\nWhere you kiss me baby I can't get enough\n\nBut the biggest crime that you ever committed\n\nIs you got this boy in love\n\nYeah you've got this boy in love",
