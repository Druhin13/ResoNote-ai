  "lyrics": "With a heart as black as raven\r\nEyes of fire, a burning flame\r\nShe offered up her soul for the taking\r\nSaid we'd never speak our names\r\nYou wanna walk a mile in my shoes\n\nI'll tell you there's a long way to go\n\nYou wanna walk a mile in my shoes\n\nNaked truth and thunder will roar\n\n\n\nTake me to the church\n\nWhere I can find salvation and a miracle\n\nTake me to the church\n\nOf holy water now\n\nMaybe we can sing hallelujah\n\nTake me to the church\n\nWhere I can find salvation and a miracle\n\nTake me to the church\n\nOf holy water now\n\nMaybe we can find our way home\n\nOh, take me to the church\n\n\n\nFor many nights under the moonlight\n\nThe candles burned, the passion raged\n\nShowed me things beyond the darkness\n\nHer spell was cast and still remains\n\n\n\nYou wanna walk a mile in my shoes\n\nI'll tell you there's a long way to go\n\nYou wanna walk a mile in my shoes\n\nNaked truth and thunder will roar\n\n\n\nTake me to the church\n\nWhere I can find salvation and a miracle\n\nTake me to the church\n\nOf holy water now\n\nMaybe we can sing hallelujah\n\nTake me to the church\n\nWhere I can find salvation and a miracle\n\nTake me to the church\n\nOf holy water now\n\nMaybe we can find our way home\n\nOh, take me to the church\n\n\n\nThe cross we bear when love turns tragic\n\nAll the signs we never read\n\nTreat the tears as lasting treasures\n\nAnd kiss the stranger in your bed\n\n\n\nYou wanna walk a mile in my shoes\n\nI'll tell you there's a long way to go\n\nYou wanna walk a mile in my shoes\n\nNaked truth and thunder will roar\n\n\n\nTake me to the church\n\nWhere I can find salvation and a miracle\n\nTake me to the church\n\nOf holy water now\n\nMaybe we can sing hallelujah\n\nTake me to the church\n\nWhere I can find salvation and a miracle\n\nTake me to the church\n\nOf holy water now\n\nMaybe we can find our way home\n\nTake me to the church",
