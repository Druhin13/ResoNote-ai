  "lyrics": "Pushed up against the ropes, you wouldn't last another round. \nI never wished for you to suffer like this. \nYou would not listen. \nWe will survive, the strong, the fortunate, the never ending. \nWe will survive through thick and thin.\r\nLooking in the mirror, seeing a trouble reflection. \n\nThis is our darkest hour. \n\nRemember what you said when we waved our goodbyes. \n\nWe're all dead in the end, so live life while you can. \n\nYou've abandoned me. \n\nYou've abandoned all of us. \n\nWe've forgiven you, so forgive yourself.\n\nI have little sympathy for this divorce story. \n\nStand in front of the jury, with no happy ending",
