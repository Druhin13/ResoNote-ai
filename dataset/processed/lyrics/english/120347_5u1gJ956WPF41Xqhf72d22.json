  "lyrics": "People say I ain't no good\r\nAnd I'm crazy as a loon\r\n'Cause I get stoned in the morning\r\nI get drunk in the afternoon\r\nI'm kinda like my old blue tick hound\r\nI like to lay around in the shade\n\nAnd I ain't got no money\n\nBut I damn sure got it made\n\n\n\nAnd I ain't asking nobody for nothin'\n\nIf I can't get it on my own\n\nIf you don't like the way I'm livin'\n\nJust leave this long haired country boy alone\n\n\n\nWell I've seen a preacher man talking on TV\n\nHe was puttin' down the rock and roll\n\nHe wants me to send a donation\n\n'Cause he's worried about my soul\n\nHe said Jesus walked on the water\n\nAnd y'all know this is true\n\nBut sometimes I think that old preacher man\n\nWould sure like to do a little walking too\n\n\n\n'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'\n\nIf I can't get it on my own\n\nIf you don't like the way I'm livin'\n\nJust leave this long haired country boy alone\n\n\n\nI said, the poor girl wants to marry\n\nAnd the rich girl wants to flirt\n\nThe rich boys went off to college\n\nAnd all of us poor boys came to work\n\nThe drunkard wants another drink of wine\n\nAnd the politician wants your vote\n\nBut me, I don't want much of nothin' at all\n\nBut I will take another toke\n\n\n\n'Cause I ain't asking nobody for nothin'\n\nIf I can't get it on my own\n\nIf you don't like the way I'm livin'\n\nJust leave this long haired country boy alone\n\nIf you don't like how I'm livin'\n\nJust leave this long haired country boy alone",
