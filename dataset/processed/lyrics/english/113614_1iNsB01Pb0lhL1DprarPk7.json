  "lyrics": "I found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see\r\nThe cliff edge in front of me\r\nNo cloud can catch me now\r\nIt brings me closer to God\r\nBut keeps the dirt in the wound\n\nAnd now the beast has teeth\n\n\n\nI've got my hand on my heart\n\nI thought that I knew the way\n\nBut I've been torn apart\n\n\n\nNow I know there's a holy grail\n\nBut it's beyond the pale\n\nWhy must we always fly so close to the sun?\n\nThe silhouettes have fallen one by one\n\n'Cause we forget that the sun sets\n\nAnd we're not long for this world\n\nNo cloud can catch me now\n\n\n\nI found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see\n\nThe cliff edge in front of me\n\n\n\nThe devil's recruits whisper in my ear\n\n\"Go tighten that noose\", but it's clear\n\nI've gotta follow the thread\n\nInstead, I'll dream of the end, and I will raise the dead\n\n\n\nWe're all refusing to feel\n\nAnd yet we're dying to heal\n\nBut there is only now\n\nAnd there's no easy way out\n\n\n\nI found my way to the garden, but I couldn't see\n\nThe cliff edge in front of me\n\n\n\nNow I know there's a holy grail\n\nBut it's beyond the pale\n\nWhy must we always fly so close to the sun?\n\nThe silhouettes have fallen one by one\n\n'Cause we forget that the sun sets\n\nAnd now we're not long for this world\n\nNo cloud can catch me now\n\n\n\nI see no silver linings\n\nWhen the days are so dark\n\nSo hold a flame to these words\n\nEnough pressure will create a diamond, oh\n\n\n\nI see no silver linings\n\nWhen the days are so dark\n\nSo hold a flame to these words\n\nEnough pressure will create a diamond\n\nEnough pressure will create a diamond",
