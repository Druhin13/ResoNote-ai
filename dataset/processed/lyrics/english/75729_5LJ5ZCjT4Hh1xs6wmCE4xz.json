  "lyrics": "Ooh, fall in love\r\nOne of these days, one of these nights\r\nOne of these days, you’re gonna be mine\r\nIt’s just a dream, my little fantasy\r\nThat one of these days, your heart will belong to me\n\n\n\nOne of these days, one of these nights\n\nYou’re gonna see clear through my eyes\n\nI’m in no hurry; forever cannot be rushed\n\nBut inevitably, baby we’re gonna fall in love\n\n\n\nAnd in years to come we’ll spend whole days\n\nWith lemonade on our back porch\n\nJust-a swaying to the rhythm\n\nWith my hand and my heart in yours\n\n\n\nPick it! La-da-da-da\n\n\n\nOne of these days, one of these nights\n\nDarlin’ you’re in for the surprise of your life!\n\nYou’re gonna open your sleepy eyes to the bright clear morn\n\nAnd I’m just sayin’ you might be sleeping next to me\n\nSo don’t say that I didn’t warn\n\n\n\n‘Cause in years to come we’ll spend whole days\n\nWith lemonade on our back porch\n\nOne of these days, we’re gonna fall\n\nOne of these days, you know that we’re gonna fall\n\nYeah, one of these days\n\nWe’re gonna fall in love",
