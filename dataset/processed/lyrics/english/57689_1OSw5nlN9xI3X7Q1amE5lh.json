  "lyrics": "I was floating on an ocean\r\nCatching up with the murder of crows\r\nWe were clashing like fireflies\r\nRunning away from all we know\r\nPick me up\n\nPick me up (It was all spiritless)\n\nPick me up\n\nHead for the ocean (Beyond my mind)\n\n\n\nPick me up\n\nPick me up (It was all spiritless)\n\nPick me up\n\nHead for the big wild\n\n\n\nI was free from your lament\n\nBorn, born onto this sheltered state\n\nI’ve been trying to break my chains\n\nBecome the child without the pain\n\nPick me up\n\nPick me up (It was all spiritless)\n\nPick me up\n\nHead for the ocean (Beyond my mind)\n\n\n\nPick me up\n\nPick me up (It was all spiritless)\n\nPick me up\n\nHead for the big wild\n\n\n\nHeading north past the canyons\n\nYou were a drug to the sky\n\nPicking out constellations\n\nIlluminating foreign skies\n\nIt was all spiritless\n\nIt was all spiritless\n\n\n\nWe were facing the big wild (It was all spiritless)\n\nClimb high like a spitfire (It was all spiritless)\n\nLeave this city for a new life (It was all spiritless)\n\nBlur the lines of this crazy dream\n\n\n\nDream\n\nYeah I said dream\n\n\n\nDown by the ocean\n\nThe deep blue\n\nDrowning in that magenta sky\n\n\n\nI’m coming to the notion\n\nChase the light, head for the big wild\n\n\n\nJust you and me\n\nInto nothing\n\nJust you and me",
