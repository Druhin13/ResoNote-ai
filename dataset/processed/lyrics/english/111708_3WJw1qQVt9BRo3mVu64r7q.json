  "lyrics": "How do I just forget that you were a part of me?\nHow do I leave behind everything we knew?\nLooking inside of myself, where my heart it'd be\nAnd all I see is you there too\n\nTwo of us goin' around in a state of denial, girl\n\nNeither believin' the way it all came down\n\nDidn't count much lost in paying the cost for a while, girl\n\nThen this old world stopped spinning 'round\n\n\n\nIn better days we had it all\n\nIn better days when love came easy\n\nWe had it all but I never knew\n\nHow much there was when I had you\n\nIn better days, in better days\n\n\n\nI remember a time there wasn't a dime between us two\n\nWe lived in a little old place on the side of a hill\n\nGave it our best in love, did the rest for me and you\n\nToo young to lose, too hot to chill\n\n\n\nIn better days we had it all\n\nIn better days when love came easy\n\nWe had it all but I never knew\n\nHow much I lost when I lost you\n\nIn better days, in better days\n\n\n\nWhy do we promise forever and never stay that long?\n\nWhy do we swear to care until we die?\n\nAnd what does it mean when two lovers sing loving songs\n\nThen move along, and not know why\n\n\n\nIn better days we had it all\n\nIn better days when love was easy\n\nWe had it all but I never knew\n\nHow much there was between me and you\n\nIn better days, back in better days\n\nIn better days, way back in better days",
