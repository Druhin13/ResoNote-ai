  "lyrics": "You're losing me\r\nStuck inside a loop and though you always disagree\r\nThere's nothing I can do\r\nSo I just\r\nLet go and let you suffocate\n\nCause you know, you know that you're too late\n\nThis I swear to you no matter what you do\n\nI'm gone for good\n\n\n\nYou've always known that I never show where my heads at til it's gone\n\nYou've always said you're just a thread, just sew me up and I'll say\n\n\n\nTake my breath away, I'm okay\n\nGood to know that you're still fading\n\nI've bled myself for this\n\nPaid in full, but now I'm cashing out\n\n\n\nWhen it's face to face you just change, hurts to see me\n\nYeah you hate it\n\nYou failed to see the strength in me\n\nBut now you're finding out\n\n\n\nYou see my face\n\nBlank and empty\n\nJust waiting to leave this place\n\nI should have known to cut this off and just suffer as I grow\n\nSo let go, I know it's hard to take\n\nAnd you know, you know what's on my plate\n\nThis I swear to you no matter what you do, I'm gone for good\n\n\n\nTake my breath away, I'm okay\n\nGood to know that you're still fading\n\nI've bled myself for this\n\nPaid in full, but now I'm cashing out\n\n\n\nWhen it's face to face you just change, hurts to see me\n\nYeah you hate it\n\nYou failed to see the strength in me\n\nBut now you're finding out\n\n\n\nAnd if you hurt yourself to prove something else\n\nKnow I hardly remember your face\n\nThere's nothing left to prove, feel like I barely knew\n\nThis demon I thought would stay in one place\n\nBut I'm gone\n\n\n\nTake my breath away, I'm okay\n\nGood to know that you're still fading\n\nYou failed to see the strength in me\n\nBut now you're finding out\n\n\n\nWhen it's face to face you just change, hurts to see me\n\nYeah you hate it\n\nYou failed to see the strength in me\n\nBut now you're finding out\n\n\n\nThe strength in me\n\nBut now you're finding out",
