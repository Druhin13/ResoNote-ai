  "lyrics": "Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick\r\nAnd think of you\r\nCaught up in circles confusion\r\nIs nothing new\r\nFlashback--warm nights\r\nAlmost left behind\n\nSuitcases of memories\n\nTime after\n\n\n\nSometimes you picture me\n\nI'm walking too far ahead\n\nYou're calling to me, I can't hear\n\nWhat you've said\n\nThen you say--go slow\n\nI fall behind\n\nThe second hand unwinds\n\n\n\nChorus\n\nIf you're lost you can look--and you will find me\n\nTime after time\n\nIf you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting\n\nTime after time\n\n\n\nAfter my picture fades and darkness has\n\nTurned to gray\n\nWatching through windows--you're wondering\n\nIf I'm OK\n\nSecrets stolen from deep inside\n\nThe drum beats out of time--\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nYou said go slow--\n\nI fall behind\n\nThe second hand unwinds--\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nTime after time\n\nTime after time \n\nTime after time\n\nTime after time",
