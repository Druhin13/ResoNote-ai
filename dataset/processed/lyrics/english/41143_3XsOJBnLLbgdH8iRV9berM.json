  "lyrics": "Do you ever wonder how many times you've driven down this street?\r\nTo dip into the past, into my life:\r\nThe only thing I really possess, that anyone possesses, if I may speak universally\r\nThis bit of time travel takes only 40 minutes on the train\r\nFirst through the meadow lands, amidst the refineries\r\nBeautiful fields of lightened brown stalks waver like something out of a canvas\n\nI climb the stairs to the train station which, like an old brass statue, has turned green-blue from time and water\n\nThe neighbourhood was quiet\n\nWe went into the house\n\nThen I got into my old bed, and I slept well\n\nI dreamt that I was home",
