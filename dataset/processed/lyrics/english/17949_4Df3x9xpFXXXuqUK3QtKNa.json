  "lyrics": "People say I'm no-good,\r\nAnd crazy as a loon.\r\nI get stoned in the morning,\r\nI get drunk in the afternoon.\r\nKinda like my old blue tick hound,\r\nI like to lay around in the shade,\n\nAn', I ain't got no money,\n\nBut I damn sure got it made.\n\n\n\n'Cos I ain't askin' nobody for nothin',\n\nIf I can't get it on my own.\n\nIf you don't like the way I'm livin',\n\nYou just leave this long-haired country boy alone.\n\n\n\nPreacher man talkin' on the TV,\n\nHe's a-puttin' down the rock 'n' roll.\n\nHe wants me to send a donation,'Cos he's worried about my soul.\n\nHe said: \"Jesus walked on the water,\"And I know that is true,\n\nBut sometimes I think that preacher man,\n\nWould like to do a little walkin', too.\n\n\n\nBut I ain't askin' nobody for nothin',\n\nIf I can't get it on my own.\n\nYou don't like the way I'm livin',\n\nYou just leave this long-haired country boy alone.\n\n\n\nInstrumental Break.\n\n\n\nA poor girl wants to marry, And a rich girl wants to flirt.\n\nA rich man goes to college,And a poor man goes to work.\n\nA drunkard wants another drink of wine,And a politician wants a vote.\n\nI don't want much of nothin' at all,But I will take another toke.\n\n\n\n'Cos I ain't askin' nobody for nothin',If I can't get it on my own.\n\nIf you don't like the way I'm livin',\n\nYou just leave this long-haired country boy alone.",
