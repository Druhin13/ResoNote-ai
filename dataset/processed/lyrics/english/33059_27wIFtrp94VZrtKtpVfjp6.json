  "lyrics": "A ship approaches off the starboard bow\nThe time has come to fight, the time to strike is now\nReload the cannons, and sharpen up your swords\nThey will regret the day they faced the pirate horde\n\nWho will survive no one can tell\n\nCome on, let's give 'em hell!\n\n\n\nTerror on the high seas\n\nTerror on the high seas\n\nA reign of terror on the seas\n\nWe'll bring these poseurs to their knees\n\n\n\nA flash of thunder lights up the midnight sky\n\nFifty dead across the deck as the ships draw side by side\n\nRaise up your cutlasses and quest into the fight\n\nA reign of terror we shall bring unto our foes this night\n\n\n\nWho will survive no on can tell\n\nCome on, let's give 'em hell!\n\n\n\nTerror on the high seas\n\nTerror on the high seas\n\nA reign of terror on the seas\n\nWe'll bring these poseurs to their knees\n\n\n\nAnd now the time has come to die\n\nYour destiny is nigh",
