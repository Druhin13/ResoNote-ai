  "lyrics": "You're makin’ me nervous\r\nLookin' for my car keys and pain killers\r\nTropical sweat and two middle fingers\r\nI know I should've ghosted at two\r\nBut I waited it out for you\r\nI wish I knew the way things were between us\n\nI’m packing a bag of bad ideas\n\nEvery time I'm thinkin' of you\n\n\n\nI'm tryna stay cool in the downtown weather\n\nWondering if you think of me ever\n\nYou know how to love me better\n\nIt's got me feelin' another level\n\n\n\nI can't get you off of my mind\n\nWhy do I keep wastin' my time?\n\nMan, you make it easy for me\n\nSo why can’t I make you love me?\n\nLove me\n\n\n\nLove me\n\nSo why can’t I make you love me?\n\n\n\nYou're leaving me hangin’\n\nSo I'ma play it cool when you think I wouldn't\n\nLiquor by the pool when I know you're lookin’\n\nWhile I dissect conversations\n\nMaybe there's something there for once? (Ah)\n\nTrying not to let these mind games play me\n\nI'm down to be your casual lady\n\nLong as I got you lovin' on me\n\n\n\nWhen I'm tryna stay cool in the downtown weather\n\nWondering if you think of me ever\n\nYou know how to love me better\n\nIt's got me feelin' another level\n\n\n\nI can't get you off of my mind\n\nWhy do I keep wastin' my time?\n\nMan, you make it easy for me\n\nSo why can't I make you love me?\n\nLove me\n\n\n\nLove me\n\nSo why can't I make you love me?\n\nLove me\n\n\n\nSo this could be a cruel summer or a real lover\n\nTell me how you want it to go\n\nWell, I don't need another issue\n\nDon't wanna miss you\n\nLove me or just let me go\n\n\n\nI can't get you off of my mind\n\nWhy do I keep wastin' my time?\n\nMan, you make it easy for me\n\nSo why can't I make you love me?\n\nLove me\n\n\n\nI can't get you off of my mind\n\nWhy do I keep wastin' my time?\n\nMan, you make it easy for me\n\nSo why can't I make you love me?\n\nLove me",
