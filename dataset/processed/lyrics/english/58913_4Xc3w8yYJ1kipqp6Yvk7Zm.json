  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Song for Sandy par Alela Diane\r\nA lady came from London town\nHer voice like water from a snowmelt stream\nShared her songs in drunken rooms\nNever once sang out of tune\n\nHow wrestling stars ricochet, and carry on\nCaught in time forever more, just thirty-one\nShe said, motherless children have a hard time\nWhen mother's gone\nBut she left her baby girl alone\nAnd nothing could be done\nNothing could be done\n\nWhen her love and child went\nHer heart hung heavy as a noose from a beam\nShe said herself, the wine it was drunk\n\nI wonder if the dream it came back\n\nHow wrestling stars ricochet, and carry on\nCaught in time forever more, just thirty-one\nShe said, motherless children have a hard time\nWhen mother's gone\nBut she left her baby girl alone\nAnd nothing could be done\nNothing could be done\n\nHow the raven's arrival did ruin the mood\nOf the lilacs blooming that pale spring day\nWhen she came to be the light through the rain\nHer melodies were all that remained\nThat remained, that remained",
