  "lyrics": "We are traveling over the midnight\r\nWe are holding our hearts\r\nWe are in flight\r\nAnd our shoes might as well be nails!\r\nIn our minds play 1000 pretty songs (for us)\r\nAnd there’s nothing up here that could be savage\n\nThere’s no fear, no hatred, no killers, no guns\n\n\n\nAnd besides, you're wearing red ruby lipstick\n\nSo I touch you and smile while you laugh\n\nWhile these idiots all lose their power\n\nAnd we dance as we cover our trail\n\n\n\nYeah this world it is burning\n\nBut don't it feel incredible?\n\nWhisper in my ear\n\nAnd tell me what you see in the flames\n\n\n\nThere's a freak loading out of my driveway\n\nHe's a stranger with a kind hippie face\n\nThere's the muscled ghost\n\nAnd it’s riddled with torment\n\nCan you roll babe?\n\nHere's some papers and grass\n\n\n\nAnd besides, we've got the whole town to roam around in\n\nAnd they've overdubbed our voices in French\n\nTo the Beverly Hills for our Margaritas\n\nYou look so pretty in the polo, but you’re smashing in pink\n\n\n\nYeah this world it is burning\n\nBut don't it feel incredible?\n\nWhisper in my ear\n\nAnd tell me what you see in the flames, in the flames\n\n\n\nWe are traveling over the midnight\n\nWe are holding our own, we are in flight\n\nAnd our shoes they might as well be nails\n\nOur minds play 1000 pretty tunes (for us)\n\nThere is nothing up here that could be savage\n\nTheres no fear, no hatred, no killers, no guns",
