  "lyrics": "Shammy cleaning all the windows,\r\nSinging songs about Edith Piaf's soul.\r\nAnd I hear blue strains of \"no regredior\"\r\nAcross the street from Cathedral Notre Dame.\r\nMeanwhile back in San Francisco\n\nWe're trying hard to make this whole thing blend,\n\nAs we sit upon this jagged\n\nStorey block, with you my friend.\n\n\n\nAnd it's a long way to Buffalo.\n\nIt's a long way to Belfast city too.\n\nAnd I'm hoping the choice won't blow the hoist\n\n'cos this town, they bit off more than they can chew.\n\n\n\nAs we gaze out on, as we gaze out on\n\nAs we gaze out on, as we gaze out on\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\n\n\nAll the orange boxes are scattered.\n\nAgainst the Safeway's supermarket in the rain.\n\nAnd everybody feels so determined\n\nNot to feel anyone else's pain.\n\n\n\n(You know that) No one's making no commitments\n\nTo anybody but themselves,\n\nHidin' behind closed doorways,\n\nTryin' to get outside, outside of empty shells\n\n\n\nAnd for every cross-cuttin' country corner,\n\nFor every Hank Williams railroad train that cried,\n\nAnd all the chains, badges, flags and emblems\n\nAnd every strain on every brain and every eye [?]\n\n\n\nAs we gaze out on, as we gaze out on\n\nAs we gaze out on, as we gaze out on\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview.\n\n\n\nAnd the restaurant tables are completely covered.\n\nThe record company has paid out for the wine.\n\nYou got everything in the world you ever wanted\n\nRight about now your face should wear a smile.\n\n\n\nThat's the way it all should happen\n\nWhen you're in, when you're in the state you're in;\n\nYou've got your pen and notebook ready,\n\nI think it's about time, time for us to begin.\n\n\n\nAnd we're over in a 52nd Street apartment,\n\nSocializing with the wino few,\n\nJust to be hip and get wet with the jet set.\n\nBut they're flying too high to see my point of view.\n\n\n\nAs we gaze out on, as we gaze out on\n\nAs we gaze out on, as we gaze out on\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview.\n\n\n\nSee them freedom marching,\n\nOut on the street, freedom marching.\n\nSaint Dominic's Preview.",
