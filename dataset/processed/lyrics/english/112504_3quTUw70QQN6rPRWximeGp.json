  "lyrics": "You're like some kinda lightning\r\nYou say all of the right things\r\nYou got me coming alive\r\nAfter all of the hurt I've had\r\nHate how he's still got me\n\nBlame it on bad timing\n\nYou shouldn't come so close\n\nWhen you're looking at me like that\n\n\n\nIf I were you\n\nI would be running, I would be leaving now\n\nIf I were you I wouldn't look back\n\nOh, but I want you to\n\nKeep me in the back of your mind\n\nMaybe call me up sometime\n\nIn a couple-a years if you haven't found somebody new\n\nThat's what I would do\n\nIf I were you\n\n\n\nYou wish I didn't miss him\n\nAnd I wish I could kiss you\n\nAnd have you be the only one that I'm thinking about\n\nAnd I'm not strong enough to\n\nResist for the both of us\n\n\n\nIf you stay I'm gonna break your heart\n\nI would make it stop before it starts\n\n\n\nIf I were you\n\nI would be running, I would be leaving now\n\nIf I were you I wouldn't look back\n\nOh, but I want you to\n\nKeep me in the back of your mind\n\nMaybe call me up sometime\n\nIn a couple-a years if you haven't found somebody new\n\nThat's what I would do\n\nIf I were you\n\n\n\nWho could do without you?\n\nBaby, I have no doubt\n\nYou'll have found somebody else\n\nBy the time I figure it out\n\n\n\nThat's what I would do, mmm\n\nIf I were you\n\n\n\nIf I were you\n\nI would be running, I would be leaving now\n\nIf I were you I wouldn't look back\n\nOh, but I want you to\n\nKeep me in the back of your mind\n\nMaybe call me up sometime\n\nIn a couple-a years if you haven't found somebody new\n\nThat's what I would do\n\nIf I were you",
