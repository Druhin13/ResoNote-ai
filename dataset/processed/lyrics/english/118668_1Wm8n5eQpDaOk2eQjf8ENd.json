  "lyrics": "You had a bed made\r\nAnd all these precious memories\r\nYou had to run away\r\nYou're looking for that bigger stage\r\nFor all those, all those blinding lights\n\nThere's something, something I won't find\n\n\n\nI'm going back home to the place where I belong\n\nThere's nothing like it\n\nNo, nothing like it\n\nTake me back home\n\nWhere the blood runs through my soul\n\nI can't describe it, there's nothing like it\n\n\n\nYou were my vagabond\n\nYou swam across the devils pond\n\nLet the comfort of your family\n\nDeliver all your fantasies\n\n\n\nAnd for all those, all those stars that shine\n\nIt's a different, different kind of light\n\n\n\nI'm going back home to the place where I belong\n\nThere's nothing like it\n\nNo, nothing like it\n\nTake me back home\n\nWhere the blood runs through my soul\n\nI can't describe it, there's nothing like it\n\n\n\nI'm going back home to the place where I belong\n\nThere's nothing like it\n\nTake me back home\n\nWhere the blood runs through my soul\n\nI can't describe it\n\n\n\nTake me back home to the place where I belong\n\nThere's nothing like it\n\nNo, nothing like it\n\nTake me back home\n\nWhere the blood runs through my soul\n\nI can't describe it, there's nothing like it\n\n\n\nTake me back home to the place where I belong\n\nThere's nothing like it\n\nNo, nothing like it\n\nTake me back home\n\nWhere the blood runs through my soul\n\nI can't describe it, there's nothing like it",
