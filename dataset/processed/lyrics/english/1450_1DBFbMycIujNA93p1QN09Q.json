  "lyrics": "One, two, three, four\r\nBefore we get started it I'll clean this up\r\nNo use drinking from a leaking cup\r\nYou know what I mean?\r\nNot really, it seems\n\nAnd we get going, we'll keep it saying\n\nChanges as good as a holiday\n\nI'm not claiming I'm some patron saint\n\n\n\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\n\nAll of what I got I give it all away\n\n\n\nWalkin' on eggshells gets tiring and\n\nPulling teeth, white-knuckling\n\nAnd I don't wanna hurt your feelings\n\nSo I say nothing\n\nA sort of self-righteous, my heart of gold\n\nJust sit back, do what you're told\n\nIf you spot it, you got it\n\nWell, maybe I got it too\n\n\n\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\n\nAll of what I got I give it all away\n\n\n\nAnd it goes\n\nAnd it goes\n\nYeah, it goes away\n\nSay what you need to...\n\n\n\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\n\nAll of what I got I give it all away\n\nSay what you want, don't got a lot\n\nAll of what you got you throw it all away",
