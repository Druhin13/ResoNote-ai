  "lyrics": "You’re the only one to blame\r\nIf you try to see looking through your sleeve\r\nYou don’t have to be afraid\r\nBut if you try to clean with kerosene\r\nYou’ll burn away\r\nYou roll the dice to see your fate\n\nThe devil always wins the game\n\nYou’re better off with throwing grenades\n\n\n\nBlow it up you like the way it burns\n\nYou’ll burn at every turn\n\nSoon enough you’re gonna have to learn\n\nWhen you light the fire to your flame\n\nThere’s nothing left to say\n\nDon’t expect for me to call your name\n\n\n\nCause you wanna dream\n\nBut your therapy gets stuck inside your head\n\nAnd when you try to leave\n\nThe hand that feeds is on your neck\n\nYou roll the dice to see your fate\n\nThe devil always wins the game\n\nYou’re better off with throwing grenades\n\n\n\nBlow it up you like the way it burns\n\nYou’ll burn at every turn\n\nSoon enough you’re gonna have to learn\n\nWhen you light the fire to your flame\n\nThere’s nothing left to say\n\nDon’t expect for me to call your name\n\n\n\nYou’re the only one\n\nYou’re the only one to blame\n\nCome on\n\nThe only one to blame\n\n\n\nBlow it up you like the way it burns\n\nYou’ll burn at every turn\n\nSoon enough you’re gonna have to learn\n\nExplode, Explode\n\nWhen you light the fire to your flame\n\nThere’s nothing left to say\n\nDon’t expect for me to call your name\n\n\n\nYou’re the only one to blame\n\nDon’t expect for me to call your name\n\nThe only one to blame\n\nDon’t expect for me to call your name\n\nThe only one to blame",
