  "lyrics": "Silence, indifference, guilty as charged\r\nBecoming one, justice and wrath\r\nBloodshed, how ignorance begets more violence\r\nPart of the crime, sentenced to death\r\nLife or grave chosen in haste\r\nBetween the wolf and its prey\n\nDon't move a finger, God forbid!\n\nSadness and corruption, abuse of power\n\nThe land you claim belongs to no one\n\nFairness, zero tolerance with the intolerant\n\nProtected by the welfare state\n\nFlan-waving, false patriots behold the downfall of the nation\n\nReserve a first class seat for the electric chair\n\nYour contribution to improve the human race\n\n\n\n\n\nFascism and nacism march unpunished\n\nFalse patriots behold the downfall of the nation\n\nTraitors!",
