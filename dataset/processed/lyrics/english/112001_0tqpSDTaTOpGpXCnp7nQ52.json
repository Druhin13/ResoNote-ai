  "lyrics": "I don’t write rhymes, I write prescriptions 'cause these niggas sickenin'\r\nMy wife is religious, her Louboutins are Christian\r\nI put so many holes in you when I bag out the Smith and\r\nWesson\r\nWhen the wind blow my nigga you gon’ be whistlin'\r\nI got so much stamina, man, I could go the distance\n\nI get so busy out in the street, I need an assistant\n\nAccredit that to god 'cause he taught me to be persistent\n\nConsistent, relentless, overcome the resistance\n\nWas on Canal Street when cassettes was still in business\n\nI came from the root of canal without a dentist\n\nI leave you pussies bleedin' until your cycle has ended\n\nA period is not only at the end of a sentence\n\n(Damn!)\n\nThe fifth down in my waistband, the kick back injured my arm, I need an ace band\n\nMan, I’m on that P. Diddy shit, make bands\n\nMy watch bright you need Ray Bans\n\nEverybody want a sex doll, what is your mental state? Damn\n\nYou want a fake woman 'cause you a fake man\n\nThis what New York sound like, Verse whack but your hook tight?\n\nLook in my eyes, this is what New York look like\n\nLames all up in the videos, Suge Knight\n\nLullaby one of you mumble rappers, good night\n\nYou wear a lot of name brand clothes but they don’t look right\n\nYou ain’t fly enough to sit on this overbooked flight\n\n\n\nMy music fallin' on deaf ears\n\nDoes anyone hear me?\n\nMy music fallin' on deaf ears\n\nIs anybody up there?\n\nDo y'all niggas hear me?\n\nDoes anybody hear me?\n\nMy music fallin' on deaf ears\n\nUnderrated\n\n\n\nI ain’t never been afraid\n\nForever gettin' paid\n\nComin' with a vendetta, Berettas gettin' sprayed\n\nRepresent the good fellas and clever renegades\n\nHave ‘em jump up out of them Jettas and wet ‘em with the gauge\n\nI be headin' to the stage, steppin' in my J's\n\nI intend to behead ‘em and shred ‘em with the blade\n\nMy endeavors are clever, intelligent and brave\n\nI could disconnect ‘em and dead ‘em, I set him in his grave\n\nDead presidents get made while my record gettin' played\n\nA veteran who aged way better than them lames\n\nInvented in my brain and indented on the page\n\nMy invention can amaze you irrelevant and vague\n\nDisrespected, arrested, I’m fed up with a rage\n\nEven slept up in the cage but I never been a slave\n\nRock a bezel that's engraved with the letters of my name\n\nResemblin' the chain, it’s a symbol of the pain\n\nNow our levels ain’t the same, if it ever gets appraised I’ll accept the biggest wage and you just the biggest lame\n\nI done boxed in the snow, wrestled in the rain, bitten by the jaws of the devil with his fangs\n\nGrabbed the handrail, man, I tell you it’s a shame\n\nAlmost knocked to the floor by the tremble of the train",
