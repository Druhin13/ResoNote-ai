hop in the foreign\n\nShe say I’m her favorite nigga\n\nYou niggas just want the fame but my niggas aiming bigger\n\nSwish, balling like James on niggas\n\nYou a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas\n\nNo piff, cookie my fragrance nigga\n\nMy wrist, cold like a glacier nigga\n\nYour bitch, tryna run games on niggas\n\nShe sucking dick, she ain’t getting paid though nigga\n\nI gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga\n\nHop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas\n\n\n\nMy 30s on go for the payments\n\nSay you in your glow, well it’s fading\n\nIn the Wraith, color Caucasian\n\nGet the cake, don’t do no waiting\n\nYou got a hand out but I had to take it\n\nI know I stand out, diamonds amazing\n\nMan down, fell asleep off the Fanta\n\nI’m the man now, buy my momma a mansion\n\n\n\nAye, I got me some change and I stayed the same nigga\n\nI hop in the foreign, I’m switching lanes quicker\n\nNo, I hop in the foreign\n\nShe say I’m her favorite nigga\n\nYou niggas just want the fame but my niggas aiming bigger\n\nSwish, balling like James on niggas\n\nYou a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas\n\nNo piff, cookie my fragrance nigga\n\nMy wrist, cold like a glacier nigga\n\nYour bitch, tryna run games on niggas\n\nShe sucking dick, she ain’t getting paid though nigga\n\nI gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga\n\nHop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas\n\n\n\n(Offset!)\n\nUh\n\nIt's a whole gang, we villains, uh\n\nTuck in your chain, I mean literally\n\nWe get you topped, JF Kennedy\n\nI go gorilla like Willie B\n\nTake off the top of the Bentley B\n\nJay Critch got your hoe in a Lambo speed\n\nPaint that bitch fat like she Mona Lis\n\nDrippin' in Saint Laurent overseas\n\nLife's a static, hit off with a Patek\n\nI fuck that hoe on the floor on the palet\n\nBaddies on baddies on baddies\n\nThey singin' like Gladys, they eat it like cabbage\n\nWe pull in, cars they on valet\n\nStars in the ceiling, no planets\n\nOn top of your bitch like a tally\n\nI walk through the mall up at Rally\n\nPull out the kisser, that bih gon' do damage\n\nBentley truck this is not standard\n\nBlack and white guts, this shit panda\n\nI wipe your nose like a scammer\n\nI smash your bitch like a animal\n\nI got the fastest coupe with no handle bar\n\nThe kill tech doin' the damage\n\nMy wrist is flooded, Titanic\n\nNew freezer, my chain is a bandit\n\nNiggas get sweet like dandies\n\nI drip on the bitch in the mannequin\n\nIce out the gang cause the gang is my family\n\nNiggas can't hold, can't fuck with me\n\nFuck a nigga' hoe with the double tree\n\nChoppin' up the dough like a puzzle piece\n\nI done spent a hunnid, diamond ear piece\n\n\n\nAye, I got me some change and I stayed the same nigga\n\nI hop in the foreign, I’m switching lanes quicker\n\nNo, I hop in the foreign\n\nShe say I’m her favorite nigga\n\nYou niggas just want the fame but my niggas aiming bigger\n\nSwish, balling like James on niggas\n\nYou a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas\n\nNo piff, cookie my fragrance nigga\n\nMy wrist, cold like a glacier nigga\n\nYour bitch, tryna run games on niggas\n\nShe sucking dick, she ain’t getting paid though nigga\n\nI gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga\n\nHop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas\n\n\n\nMy niggas working the hardest\n\nBuckets, get to the racks like Harden\n\nDuckin', from the police department\n\nFuck it, we still gon’ get it regardless\n\nAnd I’m juggin', you can’t ball with us, you garbage\n\nNiggas buggin', copy the wave we started\n\nStraight out the oven, I'm getting paid, they starving\n\nI’m in her stomach, she swallow seeds, she farming\n\nHood fave get the extras\n\nNow, fuck a next up\n\nBig Bentley truck fuck a Tesla\n\nWalk around with my chest up, flexed like a wrestler\n\nYou niggas fold under pressure\n\nRich Forever the best up\n\nGet it together, making these niggas play catch up\n\nI hope you got your vest up\n\nYou tryna test us, they gon’ be cleaning your mess up\n\nYour bitch was fronting ‘til she seen me stunting\n\nBaby I know you know better\n\nI want the money that’s end of discussion\n\nDon’t call me 'less it’s ‘bout cheddar\n\nI’m in the hood, 4 grams in the wood\n\nIt’s me Bundie, Justo and Cheddar\n\nAll this ice looking good, try and hit jug\n\nPussy boy you could never\n\nYour bitch say she love me forever and ever\n\nAnd I did not know what to tell her\n\nSwitched up once I hit it, I know she a bird\n\nThis Gucci ain’t touching no feathers\n\nI'ma hop in the coupe and I swerve\n\nI’m keeping my foot on the peddle\n\nI heard she be fucking with nerds, shawty you not on my level\n\n\n\nAye, I got me some change and I stayed the same nigga\n\nI hop in the foreign, I’m switching lanes quicker\n\nNo, I hop in the foreign\n\nShe say I’m her favorite nigga\n\nYou niggas just want the fame but my niggas aiming bigger\n\nSwish, balling like James on niggas\n\nYou a bitch, that’s why I can’t hang with niggas\n\nNo piff, cookie my fragrance nigga\n\nMy wrist, cold like a glacier nigga\n\nYour bitch, tryna run games on niggas\n\nShe sucking dick, she ain’t getting paid though nigga\n\nI gave her a tip, cut off that lame ass nigga\n\nHop out the whip, been put that flame on niggas",
