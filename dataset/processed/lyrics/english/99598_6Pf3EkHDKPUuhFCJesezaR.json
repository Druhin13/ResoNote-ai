  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Sleep par Dima\r\nNow it's half past nine, and I'm restless again \nWon't you pick me up, go to Mel's drivin' \nToo much energy, fast paces' killing me \nBut I've got empty seats in my beat-up Jeep \n\nOh, I need to, I really need you \nI need someone to, someone to talk to \nI'm movin' too fast, I need to backtrack \nIt's getting pitch black, and I need you \n\nI just need to sleep \nSo maybe we could sleep together \nWe could share the sheets \nAnd we don't have to take it further \nWe could talk about our problems, how to solve 'em \n\nBut first I just need to sleep \nSo maybe we could sleep together \n\nI need some discipline, so be my melatonin \nShapin' new routine, I've got fast lane for tea (Oh-oh) \nToo many needs to cater, we can fall in love later \n\nI'm fucking faded, and now I'm lost and jaded \n\nOh, I need to, I really need you \nI need someone to, someone to talk to \nI'm movin' too fast, I need to backtrack \nIt's getting pitch black, and I need you \n\nI just need to sleep \nSo maybe we could sleep together \n\nWe could share the sheets (Mm) \nAnd we don't have to take it further \nWe could talk about our problems, how to solve 'em \nBut first I just need to sleep (I do) \nSo maybe we could sleep together \n\nOh I need you \n(So maybe we could sleep together) \n\nAh-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh \nOh I need to (I do) \n(And we don't have to take it further) \nWe could talk about our problems, how to solve 'em \nBut first I just need to sleep (I do) \nSo maybe we could sleep together",
