  "lyrics": "Why'd you have to go and leave me out in the cold\r\nI was too young, so how could I know\r\nYou didn't give me a light when I tried to grow\r\nAnd then you jetted out and took a piece of my soul\r\nSticks and stones may chip at your bones\r\nEspecially when they hit so close to home\n\nBut I cut all the losses, buried all the skeletons\n\nDropped all the grudges, I can be myself again\n\nThat's the past and I'm moving on fast\n\nAnd I won't blame you for the cause of collapse\n\nThey say you've got to live to forgive and forget\n\nCause holding on to it is a bigger regret\n\n\n\nAll of the words they said\n\nThat debts been paid in full\n\nAll of the things they did\n\nI can let it go, I can let it go\n\nThe hate, the hurt, the fear, the pride\n\nIt all just disappear when I conceed\n\n\n\n[Chorus:]\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nNone of the words they said\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nNone of the things they did\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\n\n\nI feel sick when I go over my resume\n\nBoth at who I am and things I did yesterday\n\nFantasizing I could take it back\n\nBut it's a wasted act, have to face the fact that\n\nI've got to live with the pain I've caused\n\nAnd walk amongst those who sustained to loss\n\nPicking up the pieces of broken trust\n\nWhen their hopes were crushed down to smoke and dust\n\nI said I didn't know and played the role beautifully\n\nThen I abandoned you when it suited me\n\nIt's a stain that I can't erase\n\nAnd I'm ashamed but I can only ask for grace cause\n\n\n\nAll of the words they said\n\nThat debts been paid in full\n\nAll of the things they did\n\nYou can let it go, you can let it go\n\nThe hate, the hurt, the fear, the pride\n\nIt all just disappear when we conceed\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nIt never mattered at all\n\nIt never mattered at all",
