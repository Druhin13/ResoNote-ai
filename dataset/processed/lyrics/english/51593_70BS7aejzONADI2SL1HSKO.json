  "lyrics": "In the brain, in the engine room, the gamers? are out, I got fires to put out.\r\nIn the rain, on the eastbound train, rushing towards some kind of future where you found me in a lonely wooden tower.\r\nNothing is more real than what it is.\r\nAnd I’m trying to show you.\n\nAnd I never expected you to deliver me, well I never wanted anything easily. Everything's changing, but we got to stay for real.\n\n\n\nAnd the way that we speak is coming out differently, nothing we wish for ever comes easily. Everything's changing, but we got to stay for real.\n\n\n\nDon’t be vain. Don’t swallow the bloom. Keep it plain and devout, as the fires burn out. In my brain, in an unlit lane walking a road that leads to nowhere, where you found me, in a lonely wooden tower.\n\nNothing is more real than what it is.\n\nThat’s what I’m trying to show you.\n\n\n\nAnd I never expected you to deliver me. Well, I never wanted anything easily. Everything's changing, but we got to stay for real. And the way that we speak is coming out differently, nothing we wish for ever comes easily. Everything's changing, but we got to Stay for real.",
