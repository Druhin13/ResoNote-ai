  "lyrics": "When love was found\r\nI kept my hope just like I'd hoped to\r\nThen sang to the sea for feelings deep blue\r\nAnd coming down\r\nWe've had problems that we've grown through\r\nBut I bet you dream of what you could do\n\nAt seventeen I was alright\n\nWas like nothing I could feel inside\n\nAnd wishing you were here tonight\n\nIs like holding on\n\nBut I still get to see your face, right?\n\nAnd that's like nothing they can take, right?\n\nSo there won't be no feeling in the firelight\n\nHoping this will be right\n\nTime to show your worth, child\n\nI remember when her heart broke over stubborn shit\n\nThat's no way to be living kid\n\nThe angel of death is ruthless\n\nAnd I'm always thinking summertime with the bikes out\n\nPushing our luck getting wiped out\n\nDays with nothing but laughing loud\n\nUnderneath my coat won't you tap my shoulder, hold my hand\n\nNights with nothing but dark in there\n\nYou can be my armor then\n\nIsland smiles and cardigans\n\nThe nights that we've been drinking in\n\nWe're here to help you kill all of this hurt that you've been harboring\n\nConfessions should be better planned\n\nAlone, that night, I'm surely damned\n\nRun away. I'll understand\n\nWhat's important is this evening I will not forget\n\nPurple, blue, orange, red\n\nThese colors of feeling, give me love, I'll put my heart in it\n\nI think about it all the time\n\nThe lights went out, you were fine\n\nYou kinda struggle not to shine\n\nI still love you though\n\nI still love you though\n\nI still love you always\n\nSo hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long\n\nCrack and break and part ways\n\nI still love you though\n\nI still love you though\n\nI still love you always\n\nSo hold me when I'm home, keep the evenings long\n\nLet's not crack and break and part ways\n\nAnd I wonder if I could let her down\n\nIt's for real, it's for real\n\nIt's for real, it's for real",
