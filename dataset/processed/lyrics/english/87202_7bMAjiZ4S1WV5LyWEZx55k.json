  "lyrics": "I, I'm driving black on black \nJust got my license back\r\nI got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track\r\nI'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride\r\nBecause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight\r\nI'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out \n\nI got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run\n\nYour mom don't know that you were missing\n\nShe'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing\n\nScreamin'\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\nNo, we're never gonna quit\n\nAin't nothing wrong with it\n\nJust acting like we're animals\n\nNo, no matter where we go\n\n'Cause everybody knows\n\nWe're just a couple of animals\n\n\n\nSo come on baby, get in\n\nGet in, just get in\n\nCheck out the trouble we're in\n\n\n\nYou're beside me on the seat\n\nGot your hand between my knees\n\nAnd you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze\n\nIt's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear\n\nBut I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears\n\nBy now, no doubt that we were heading south\n\nI guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth\n\n'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch\n\nIt felt so good I almost drove into the ditch\n\nI'm screamin'\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n\n\nSo come on baby, get in\n\nGet in, just get in\n\nLook at the trouble we're in\n\n\n\nWe were parked out by the tracks\n\nWe're sitting in the back\n\nAnd we just started getting busy \n\nWhen she whispered \"what was that?\"\n\nThe wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are\n\nAnd that was when she started screamin' \n\n\"That's my dad outside the car!\"\n\nOh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition\n\nMust have wound up on the floor while \n\nwe were switching our positions\n\nI guess they knew that she was missing\n\nAs I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing\n\nScreamin'\n\n\n\n[CHORUS]\n\n\n\nSo come on baby, get in\n\nWe're just a couple of animals\n\nGet in, just get in\n\nAin't nothing wrong with it\n\nCheck out the trouble we're in\n\nGet in, just get in",
