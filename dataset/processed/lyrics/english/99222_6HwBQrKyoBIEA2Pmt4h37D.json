  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Right now par Dirty Projectors\r\n[David Longstreth]\nThe sky has darkened earth, turned to hell\nSome said a light got shined where darkness dwelled\nSo I won't cry or collapse, overwhelmed\nTime like a song just might rhyme with itself\n\n[David Longstreth]\nI don't know how I'm going to be a better man\nI don't know how I'm going to reach the Promised Land\nI don't know how I'm going to get you to take my hand\nBut I'm going to try and I know when\n\n[David Longstreth + Syd]\n\nNow (now)\nRight now (now)\nRight now (now)\nRight now (now)\nRight now, now (now)\nRight now, now (now)\nRight now, now (now)\nRight now\n\n[David Longstreth]\nSoon the earth may dissolve like snow\nWe'll meet again in the air or bound to glow\nAnd I am glad that I got to know\nI might sing the melody\nBut I don't set the tempo\n\n[David Longstreth]\nWho draws the true straw from the fist that's clasped?\n\nWho pulls the new rope through the loopholes of the past?\nBetter hurry up for the first shall be the last\nBetter sound the trumpet before the blast\n\n[David Longstreth + Syd]\nNow (now)\nRight (now)\nNow, right (now)\nNow, right now (now)\nRight now (now)\nNow, right now (now)\nNow, right now (now)\nNow, right now\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Pre-Chorus 3]\n\nYou pulled me up when you took my hand\nThere was silence in my heart\nAnd now I'm striking up the bend\nThey lit the bonfire but now we can light the lamp\n\n[David Longstreth + Syd]\nNow (now)\nRight now (now)\nRight now (now)\nRight now (now)\nRight now, now (now)\nRight now (now, now)\nRight now (now, now)\nRight now (now, now)\nRight now (now, now)\nRight now (now, now)\nRight now (now)\n\nNow, right now, now, now, now, now",
