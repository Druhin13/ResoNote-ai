  "lyrics": "You're the mouth of the tunnel just before the dark\r\nI'm the headlights speeding through the stars\r\nAnd we're lost in the spaces of who we are\r\nAnd we move through the nights 'till we take it too far\r\nHold it together when we move apart\n\nLet the landscape burn like a dying art\n\nDriven by the energy in our hearts\n\nWe were built to be reckless from the start\n\n\n\nAnd the light just flickers past our faces\n\nLiving in a dream 'cause we're always wasted\n\nNever stay still when we're chasing places\n\n\n\nAnd the light just flickers past our faces\n\nLiving at a dream 'cause we're always wasted\n\nMaking up our minds that we're never changing\n\n\n\n'Cause we're getting lost and found when we're carried away\n\nI feel it all around, even in our mistakes\n\nAnd when we're up, we're down, in the evening space\n\nWe're getting lost and found, when we're carried away\n\n\n\nWhen we're carried away\n\n\n\nThe truth gets tired when we lie awake\n\nSo we dive into dreams that they can't sedate\n\nBreathe in and out, to go all the way\n\nTrip 'till we're fixed in a higher state\n\n\n\nAnd the light just flickers past our faces\n\nLiving in a dream 'cause we're always wasted\n\nNever stay still when we're chasing places\n\n\n\nAnd the light just flickers past our faces\n\nLiving at a dream 'cause we're always wasted\n\nMaking up our minds that we're never changing\n\n\n\n'Cause we're getting lost and found when we're carried away\n\nI feel it all around, even in our mistakes\n\nAnd when we're up, we're down, in the evening space\n\nWe're getting lost and found, when we're carried away\n\n\n\nCarry me, Carry me\n\nCarry me, Carry me\n\nCarry me, Carry me\n\n\n\nAnd the light just flickers past our faces\n\nWe're living out a dream 'cause we're always wasted\n\nAnd the light just flickers past our faces\n\nWe never stay still when we're chasing places\n\n\n\n'Cause we're getting lost and found when we're carried away\n\nI feel it all around even in our mistakes\n\nAnd when we're up, we're down, in the evening space\n\nWe're getting lost and found when we're carried away\n\n\n\nCarry me, Carry me\n\nCarry me, Carry me\n\nCarry me, Carry me",
