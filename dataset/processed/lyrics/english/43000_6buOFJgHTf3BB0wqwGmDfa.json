  "lyrics": "I had a back heavy metal breakdown\nSlack off never leaving his song\nCall me when you get to where you're going\nSee you on the flip side\n\nSpin the dress, bat your pretty lashes\n\nBurned out boys rising through the ashes\n\nLow blow, there's not enough chances\n\nWe all go insane sometimes\n\n\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure\n\nThat there's nothing left for me here\n\n(I'm pretty sure)\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure\n\nThat I'm fading more every year\n\n\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(In the valley)\n\nIt's never been so cold\n\nShe said she doesn't miss me\n\nSince I've been home\n\nI'm faithless and lonely\n\n(So lonely)\n\nShe'll say it's all good\n\nCause nobody told me\n\nIt'd be this hard in Hollywood\n\n\n\nQuick talks just before the long break\n\nTelephone tell em' what I won't say\n\nYou want it all it's never what you want break\n\nSee you on the flip side\n\n\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure\n\nThat there's nothing left for me here\n\n(I'm pretty sure)\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure\n\nThat I'm fading more every year\n\n\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(In the valley)\n\nIt's never been so cold\n\nShe said she doesn't miss me\n\nSince I've been home\n\nI'm faithless and lonely\n\n(So lonely)\n\nShe'll say it's all good\n\nCause nobody told me\n\nIt'd be this hard in Hollywood\n\n\n\nIf only you could find it in yourself to\n\nGive me one more shot\n\nI'd tell you it was worth it\n\nIt was all worth it\n\n\n\nAnd if only boulevards\n\nCould swallow wasted stars\n\nWe'd spent our brain\n\nBut we're still burning\n\n(Oh we're all burning)\n\n\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(Oh oh oh)\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(Oh oh oh)\n\nI know you don't miss me\n\n(Oh oh oh)\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(Down in the valley)\n\n\n\nDown in the valley\n\nDown in the valley\n\nI know you don't miss me\n\nDown in the valley\n\nDown in the valley\n\n\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(Oh oh oh)\n\nDown in the valley\n\n(Oh oh oh)\n\nI know you don't miss me\n\n(Oh oh oh)\n\nDown in the valley\n\nDown in the valley",
