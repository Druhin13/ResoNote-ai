  "lyrics": "Don't you know we gon' grow up\r\nAnd these lame niggas gon' hang with us, tryna roll up\r\nSo let 'em roll one and get high, get yours\r\n'Cause them bills due and them rims new, but they ain't yours\r\nAnd it's bad times, never had time to get employed\r\nGet high, get yours, out the window with the pack in it\n\nGot a stench on it like I pissed on it, take a hit and sit a nigga down\n\nI'ma get fried, get mine\n\n'Cause it's go time, ain't no sense in moving on your time\n\nBeen a CEO for like the whole time\n\n\n\nDon't go to school here, I been on campus\n\nWhere all the bitches that they label loose here? I feel like dancin'\n\nBought me some liquor and I bought a new pair, had to impress 'em\n\nThis nigga watching, I might act a fool here\n\nNo need for panicking, can't keep the peace if it's negative energy, energy\n\nDon't you know we gon' grow up\n\nAnd these lame hoes gon' pour up, tryna know us\n\nAnd I'm too damn focused to be cool with 'em\n\nSmokin' doob with 'em on a tour bus\n\nWith some new women talking 'bout they all need a new nigga\n\nTo go shopping, fuck, and go get food with 'em\n\nAnd I'm not the one, pardon me, I been on artistry\n\nMoney grab, money run\n\nDon't you know we gon' grow up\n\nAnd these lame niggas gon' hang with us, tryna roll up\n\nBut be careful, can't let shit confuse us, or control us\n\nOn the road with a whole roll of the shit\n\nI been at home on the phone earning shit\n\nI take that cash to the dome, ownership\n\n\n\nDon't you know we gon' grow up\n\nAnd these lame niggas gon' hang with us, tryna roll up\n\nSo let 'em roll one and get high, get yours\n\n'Cause them bills due and them rims new, but they ain't yours\n\nAnd it's bad times, never had time to get employed\n\nGet high, get yours, out the window with the pack in it\n\nGot a stench on it like I pissed on it, take a hit and sit a nigga down\n\nI'ma get fried, get mine\n\n'Cause it's go time, ain't no sense in moving on your time\n\nBeen a CEO for like the whole time",
