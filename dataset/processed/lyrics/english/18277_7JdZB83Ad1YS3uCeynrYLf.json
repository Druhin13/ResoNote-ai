  "lyrics": "I prefer the river\r\nThe ocean is too big a body to understand\r\nGo to where it narrows\r\nBring your bow and arrow\r\nMeet me out on the land\n\nWhite water flowing on the rocks in the sunshine\n\nDrinking red wine in the summertime\n\nNight swimming, skinny dipping, love in the moonlight\n\nAnd it's all mine\n\n\n\nI don’t want a boyfriend\n\nI don’t want a house built on the sand\n\nI don’t want a lover\n\nI want a man\n\nA coming-from-the-heart man\n\nLiving in my heartland\n\nComing-from-the-heart man\n\n\n\nUnderneath the covers of treetops and each other\n\nAwoken by a gentle breeze\n\nAre we here in silence\n\nThe birds and smells of lilacs\n\nGoing out from a city\n\n\n\nBird calling, water falling, dreams in the sunshine\n\nDrinking red wine in the summertime\n\nSun tan and Steely Dan and sounds on the radio\n\nAnd it's all mine\n\n\n\nI don’t want a boyfriend\n\nI don’t want a house built on the sand\n\nI don’t want a lover\n\nI want a man\n\nA coming-from-the-heart man\n\nLiving in my heartland\n\nComing-from-the-heart man\n\n\n\nSweet like honey dripping, oh touch and taste\n\nLights my fire burning all night and day\n\nYour soul so stunning\n\nTaking my breath away\n\nMy desire reaching out for the flame\n\n\n\nI don’t want a boyfriend\n\nI don’t want a house built on the sand\n\nI don’t want a lover\n\nI want a man\n\nA coming-from-the-heart man\n\nLiving in my heartland\n\nComing-from-the-heart man\n\nI want a man\n\n(I want a man)\n\nIn my heartland\n\nComing-from-the-heart man\n\nLiving in my heartland",
