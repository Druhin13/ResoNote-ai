You shoulda told me without delay\n\nWe was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay\n\nAnd everything that he say, she say\n\nOh, I gotta go\n\n\n\nBros become foes yeah (bros become foes)\n\nLord knows the lovin' was fly though\n\nIt ain't worth livin' these lies though\n\nOn my dog (On my dog, On my dog)\n\nYeah\n\nI should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him\n\nThat I was tappin' in\n\nI should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him\n\n'Cause he was a best friend\n\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\nThat ain't never what you do to best friends\n\n\n\nSo that is how me and my best friend fell out\n\n'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out\n\nAll of our business ventures and dreams was the hell out\n\nAnd I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout\n\nLost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb\n\nHe lost his life to another brother with a gun\n\nI never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung\n\nA other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb\n\nSo the moral of the story is\n\nDon't lie to get something that you really want\n\nAlways keep it real, though a lot of people don't\n\nThat's why they always in funk\n\n\n\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\nShoulda told him I was tappin' in\n\nThat ain't never what you do to best friends",
