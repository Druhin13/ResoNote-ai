  "lyrics": "Love is like a black hole\r\nEverything is dark\r\nYou just gotta let go\r\nAnd feel it, feel it, feel it\r\nWe fall off the deep end\r\nJust to get a rush\n\nYou know that's it's right when\n\nYa feel it, feel it, feel it\n\n\n\nWhat is life\n\nIf it's just of the earth\n\nOnly of the flesh and bones\n\nWanna thrive\n\nIn the dust\n\nOf the universe and way into unknown\n\n\n\nSo I love beyond\n\nThe bones\n\nGoes deep inside your soul\n\nI love beyond the bones\n\n\n\nWanna be the fire\n\nEven if it burns\n\nOffer up my fibers\n\nTo feel it, feel it, it\n\n\n\nWhat is life\n\nIf it's just of the earth\n\nOnly of the flesh and bones\n\nWanna thrive\n\nIn the dust\n\nOf the universe and way into unknown\n\n\n\nSo I love beyond the bones\n\nGoes deep inside your soul\n\nI love beyond the bones\n\nInto the unknown\n\nWhere no other love goes",
