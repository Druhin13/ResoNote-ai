  "lyrics": "You stare at the broken mirrors\r\nShattered reflections of the past\r\nI think we may be standin' in the same\r\nShadows that been cast\r\nDarkness, no more darkness\n\nThe broken days have beat the dead of night\n\nDarkness, no more darkness\n\nNo more darkness, no more light\n\n\n\nAnd a trail we choose to follow\n\nIt's as cursed as it is blessed\n\nIs there mercy that we all must face\n\nBefore the dead can raise?\n\n\n\nDarkness, no more darkness\n\nThe broken days have beat the dead of night\n\nDarkness, no more darkness\n\nNo more darkness, no more light\n\n\n\nAnd if you listen to the song that settled on the breeze\n\nA woman sings unto our baby boy\n\nI won't live to see the day that you'll be lifted off your knees\n\n\n\nSome days it feels so hopeless\n\nNothing's makin' any sense\n\nFlags we raise in praise of ruthless\n\nSupposes innocence\n\n\n\nDarkness, no more darkness\n\nThe broken days have beat dead of night\n\nDarkness, no more darkness\n\nNo more darkness, no more light\n\nNo more darkness, no more light\n\nNo more darkness, no more light",
