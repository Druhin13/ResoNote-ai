  "lyrics": "When I step onto the stage, see the curtain raise\r\nI’m apparent, I’ve got someone to play\r\nAll the crowd, they’re in the seats\r\nLooking straight at me for an answer\r\nThey just get what they see\r\nThey applaud and the usher’s locking the door till the matinee\n\n\n\nSo I get to know the cast, though it doesn’t last\n\nI’m a pro but I won’t take it too far\n\nNow I know I shouldn’t get comfy on the set\n\nEvery time it all comes down when we end\n\nThat’s the truth that the stage school doesn’t teach you\n\nBut it’s good to know\n\n\n\nIt takes much more than just learning the script\n\nYou see, you gotta take the part and believe it\n\nOh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot\n\nBut I will always give what I got\n\n\n\nI thought I was only acting\n\nBut I felt exactly like it was all for real\n\nI sure didn’t know it hurt so bad\n\nThat no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside\n\nWhat you gotta hide\n\nWhere to put your pride\n\nWhen to realize you’ve had your time\n\nFind another role\n\nCarry on the show\n\n\n\nYou should be able to feel a performance with your whole body and soul\n\nNow I’m gonna teach you everything I--\n\nAnd you, and you, and you, and you\n\n\n\nOh, I sometimes make up all of my lines on the spot\n\nBut I will always give what I got\n\n\n\nI thought I was only acting\n\nBut I felt exactly like it was all for real\n\nI sure didn’t know it hurt so bad\n\nThat no rehearsal could show you how to feel inside\n\nWhat you gotta hide\n\nWhere to put your pride\n\nWhen to realize you’ve had your time\n\nFind another role\n\nCarry on the show\n\n\n\nI thought I was only acting\n\nBut I felt exactl-- exactl-- exactl-- exactl-- exac--\n\nWhat you gotta hi--\n\n\n\nHow to feel inside\n\nWhat you gotta hide\n\nFind another role",
