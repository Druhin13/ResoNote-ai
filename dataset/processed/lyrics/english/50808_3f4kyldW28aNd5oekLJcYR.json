  "lyrics": "The Devil's coming for me now\r\nThere is nowhere I can run\r\nAnd if I were to stand my ground\r\nI better get my gun\r\nHe says that I should just give in\r\nSometimes it's hard to fight\n\n'Cause in this hell I'm living in\n\nIt's hard to find the light\n\n\n\nBut I can hear the angels\n\nI can hear their song\n\nEcho in the darkness\n\n\"Be gone, be gone\"\n\n\n\nI feel like there's a hope in hell\n\nThat I will find a way\n\nI have got a bullet for\n\nOne demon left to slay\n\nThe hunted is the hunter now\n\nAnd Devil, you're the prey\n\nI won't let you drag me down\n\nI'll see the light of day\n\n\n\nBut I can hear the angels\n\nI can hear their song\n\nEcho in the darkness\n\n\"Be gone, be gone\"\n\n\n\nI can hear the angels\n\nI can hear their song\n\nEcho in the darkness\n\n\"Be gone, be gone\"\n\n\"Be gone\"",
