  "lyrics": "Wise men say\r\nLooks like rain today\r\nCrackled on the speakers\r\nTrickled down the steepy subway trains\r\nHeavy eyes could hardly hold us\r\nAching legs that often told us\r\nIt's all worth it\r\nWe all fall in love sometimes\r\n♪\r\nThe full moon's bright\r\nStarlight filled the evening\r\nWe wrote it, and I played it\r\nSomething's happening, it's so strange this feeling\r\nNaive notions that were childish\r\nSimple tunes that tried to hide it\r\nBut when it comes\r\nWe all fall in love sometimes\r\n♪\r\nDid we? Didn't we? Should we? Couldn't we?\r\nI'm not sure, 'cause sometimes we're so blind\r\nStruggling through the day\r\nBut even your best friend says\r\nDon't you find?\r\nWe all fall in love sometimes\r\n♪\r\nWise men say\r\nLooks like rain today\r\nIt crackled on the speakers\r\nTrickled down the steepy subway trains\r\nHeavy eyes could hardly hold us\r\nAching legs that often told us\r\nIt's all worth it\r\nBut we all fall in love sometimes\r\n♪\r\nWe all fall in love sometimes\r\n♪\r\nWe all fall in love sometimes\r\nWe all fall in love sometimes",
