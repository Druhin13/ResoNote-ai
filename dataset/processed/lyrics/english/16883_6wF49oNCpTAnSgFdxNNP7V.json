  "lyrics": "If I won me the lottery \nI'd dance naked in the street \nWith a top hat full of money \nAnd you'd wanna get to know me \nIf I won me the lottery\n\nAnd if I was a movie star \n\nI'd sip honey from a pickle jar \n\nIn the back of my limousine \n\nAnd they'd call me an icon \n\nAnd I'd be lookin' back at you \n\nFrom the cover of the People magazine\n\n\n\nI guess it's all for the takin' \n\nI guess it's all yours and mine \n\nMy sister says I got to see it to believe it \n\nAnd I believe I believe it \n\n\n\nBut I'm just an outsider \n\nLivin' in a trailer with my black & white TV set \n\nIf only I was President \n\nYou know I'd paint the White House pink \n\nAnd never have to pay the rent \n\nIf only I was President\n\n\n\nI guess it's all there for the takin' \n\nI think it's all yours & mine \n\nMy preacher says I got to see it to believe it \n\nAnd l believe \n\nWon't sleep till I've had enough \n\nI believe\n\nWon't sip my wine from no paper cup \n\nI believe\n\nWon't sleep till I've had enough\n\n\n\nDelicious Surprise \n\nNow I do believe \n\nNo fear in my eyes \n\nNow I can see \n\n\n\nHeaven's inside inside inside \n\nI knew it all the time \n\nGot me somethin to believe in \n\nBut all I really want now is \n\nA handful of salvation",
