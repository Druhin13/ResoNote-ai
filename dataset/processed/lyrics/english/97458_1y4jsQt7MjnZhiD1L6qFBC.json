  "lyrics": "I live inside my own world of make believe\r\nKids screaming in their cradles, profanities\r\nI see the world through eyes covered in pink\r\nCross out the ones who held my cries and watched me weep\r\nI love everything\n\nFire spreading all around my room\n\nMy world's so bright\n\nIt's hard to breathe but that's alright\n\nHush\n\n\n\nTape my eyes open to force reality\n\nWhy can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?\n\nI live inside my own world of make believe\n\nKids screaming in their cradles, profanities\n\nSomedays I feel skinnier than all the other days\n\nAnd some days I can't tell if my body belongs to me\n\n\n\nI love everything\n\nFire spreading all around my room\n\nMy world's so bright\n\nIt's hard to breathe but that's alright\n\nHush\n\n\n\nI wanna taste your content\n\nHold your breath and feel the tension\n\nDevils hide behind redemption\n\nHonesty is a one way gate to hell\n\nI wanna taste consumption\n\nBreathe faster to waste oxygen\n\nHear the children sing aloud\n\nIt's music 'til the wick burns out\n\nHush!\n\n\n\nJust wanna be care free lately, yeah\n\nJust kicking up daisies\n\nGot one too many quarters in my pockets\n\nCount 'em like four leaf clovers in my locket\n\nUntied laces, yeah\n\nJust tripping on daydreams\n\nGot dirty little lullabies playing on repeat\n\nMight as well just run around the nursery and count sheep",
