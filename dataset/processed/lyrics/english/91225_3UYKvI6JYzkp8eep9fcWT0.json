  "lyrics": "These voices, all in my head\r\nNever to whisper again\r\nNever to sing me to sleep\r\nOh, but a dream\r\nRight there, caught out in the rain\r\nDrenched in a memory of pain\n\nSoaked by the old sour taste\n\nLet's hope for the better\n\n\n\nPlay to the mind, wide open\n\nAwaken the beast by the meadow\n\nPlayful at least, I'm hoping\n\nShow you the doorway to my soul\n\n\n\nCome to the root of the cause\n\nProducer will can the applause\n\nI mention it's not my fault\n\nYet my effort was needed\n\nSo I grab for some inner resource\n\nMost certainly blind to the force\n\nLetting the world takes its course\n\nWe've now superseded\n\n\n\nPlay to the mind, wide open\n\nAwaken the beast by the meadow\n\nPlayful at least, I'm hoping\n\nShow you the doorway to my soul\n\nPlay to the mind, wide open\n\nWaking the beast by the meadow\n\nPlayful at least, I'm hoping\n\nShow you the doorway to my soul\n\n\n\nAlways in my brain\n\nI'm trapped in a magical maze\n\nNot feelings of hopelessness\n\nI'm facing the mess that I've made\n\nAlways in my brain\n\nI'm trapped in a magical maze\n\nNot feelings of hopelessness\n\nI'm facing the mess that I've made\n\nMade, made, made\n\nMade, made, made, made\n\n\n\nPlay to the mind, wide open\n\nAwaken the beast by the meadow\n\nPlayful at least, I'm hoping\n\nShow you the doorway to my soul\n\nPlay to the mind, wide open\n\nAwaken the beast by the meadow\n\nPlayful at least, I'm hoping\n\nShow you the doorway to my soul\n\n\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye\n\nOh, the mind's eye",
