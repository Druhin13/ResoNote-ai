  "lyrics": "I met a woman in the hills\r\nOffered me some happy pills\r\nSaid, \"It helps the conversation,\" started rolling dollar bills\r\nI passed but she asked me something about Bentrill\r\nI said 'that's not me', so [?] my shoes\r\nThis brand, that brand, I don't really know, man\n\nI got a pair of Vans but I pulled them from a trash can\n\nBucket hat on asked me where I got it from\n\nI said, \"Target, half priced on the fourth of July\"\n\n\n\nShe showed me her skin, asked me what I believe in\n\n\n\nI said it couldn't be love 'cause it's too sincere\n\nAnd it couldn't be life 'cause death's so near\n\nSo could it be God? Wait I forgot, we don't like him here\n\nSo I got nothing to gain, nothing to lose\n\nNothing to hide but I've got something to prove\n\nSo believe in me, baby, alleviate the Beverly blues\n\n\n\nNow she's looking at me funny\n\nTying knots between her eyes\n\nSo I roll another friend in a plot to fill the silence\n\nI pass it to her, ask her what's been weighing on her mind\n\nSays, \"Nothing at all,\" I think she might have been right\n\nMy shirt's back on, I guess I figured her wrong\n\n'Cause she's asking me a question, still looking at me long\n\nShe said, \"What did you mean when you were singing that song?\"\n\nI said, \"Nothing at all\" and turned out the light\n\n\n\nAnd I'm asking myself what it is I believe in\n\n\n\nI said it couldn't be love 'cause it's too sincere\n\nAnd it couldn't be life 'cause death's so near\n\nSo could it be God? Wait I forgot, we don't like him here\n\nSo I got nothing to gain, nothing to lose\n\nNothing to hide but I've got something to prove\n\nSo believe in me, baby, alleviate the Beverly blues\n\n\n\nI said it couldn't be love 'cause it's too sincere\n\nAnd it couldn't be life 'cause death's so near\n\nSo could it be God? Wait I forgot, we don't like him here\n\nSo I got nothing to gain, nothing to lose\n\nNothing to hide but I've got something to prove\n\nSo believe in me, baby, alleviate the Beverly blues\n\n\n\nI said it couldn't be love 'cause it's too sincere\n\nAnd it couldn't be life 'cause death's so near\n\nSo could it be God? Wait I forgot, we don't like him here\n\nSo I got nothing to gain, nothing to lose\n\nNothing to hide but I've got something to prove\n\nSo believe in me, baby, alleviate the Beverly blues",
