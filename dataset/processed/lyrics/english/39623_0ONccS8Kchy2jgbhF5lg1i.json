  "lyrics": "May we all get to grow up in a red white and blue little town\r\nGet a one-start hand-me-down Ford to try to fix up\r\nWith some part time cash from driving a tractor\r\nFind a sweet little thang, wears your ball cap backwards\r\nKinda place you can't wait to leave but nobody does\r\nCause you miss it too much\n\n\n\nMay we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new off\n\nThe sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox\n\nPlay the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac\n\nHope you get lost down some road\n\nSlow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco\n\nBuy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto\n\nShe's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window\n\nWhere you 'bout to go?\n\nYeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall\n\nMay we all\n\n\n\nMay we all get to see those fields of green turn gold\n\nWatch a marching band play with the harvest moon coming up\n\nAnd know that fifteen minutes of famous\n\nAin't gonna be what makes us or breaks us but\n\nWe'll all be watching the TV the day that it comes\n\n\n\nMay we all know that nothing ain't cool 'til you wear the new one\n\nThe sound of a quarter rollin' down a jukebox\n\nPlay the Travis Tritt right above the 2Pac\n\nHope you get lost down some road\n\nSlow rolling with the top off the back of a Bronco\n\nBuy a cold sixer with a cashed in lotto\n\nShe's smilin' with her hair blowing out the window\n\nWhere you 'bout to go?\n\nYeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall\n\nMay we all\n\n\n\nMay we all do a little bit better than the first time\n\nLearn a little something from the worst times\n\nGet a little stronger from the hurt times\n\nMay we all get to have a chance to ride the fast one\n\nWalk away wiser when we crashed one\n\nKeep hoping that the best one is the last one\n\n\n\nYeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall\n\nMay we all\n\nMay we all\n\nMay we all\n\nMay we all (get to have a chance to ride the fast one)\n\nMay we all (walk away wiser when we crashed one)\n\nMay we all (keep hoping that the best one is the last one)\n\n(yeah the last one)\n\nYeah you learn to fly and if you can't then you just freefall\n\nMay we all",
