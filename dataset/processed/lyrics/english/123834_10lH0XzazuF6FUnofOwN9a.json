  "lyrics": "Uh, when it comes to wordplay I'm bringin’ it\r\nEverything I do is spine tinglin'\r\nGuarantee to keep your mind lingerin'\r\nWhen it comes down to me and the world, I’m fingerin'\r\nMe against the world, leave the ocean full of pearls\r\nOyster, guarantee to get the pussy moister\n\nIf the earth don't wanna be saved I disappoint her\n\nAs I constantly try to evolve just like a Togepi\n\nKeep my pockets thick as The Parkers, Professor Oglevee\n\nNo ones sick as me, have the common cold catch a cold from me\n\nIsn't it ironic the younger me is the older me?\n\nFans demand that I rap about shit I did at seventeen\n\nMight as well I cut my hair off and take some LSD\n\n\n\nDisrespect Zel' and I might have to raise hell\n\nThe only way you live is if you saved by the bell\n\n'Cause I'm teaching niggas lessons while they find a way to fail\n\nThat's the reason why I think you niggas trippin’ like you fell\n\nWell, I flip a coin and make a wish\n\nI wish these pussy niggas found a way to hop up off my dick\n\nI flick my wrist and make her disappear, now that’s a fuckin' trick\n\nI trick a nigga off the liquor to give me the money ’fore I fuckin' flip him\n\nThe diamonds on my neck wet flippa'\n\nShe wet but her last man wasn't a good swimmer\n\nSim Simma, who got the keys to my Beemer?\n\nAnd then I check my pockets like oh it’s me nigga (Skrrt)\n\n\n\nRemember to remember\n\nMatter fact, remember the fifth of November\n\nToo many scars upon my face, no Simba\n\nRappers thinkin' they the most dark but I'm dimmer\n\nMos Def and grimmer\n\nDare to witness the superficial, mean and vicious\n\nI'm mad as an infant without a parent having interest\n\nSuspicious intent, ridin' around in five percent tint\n\nWill push your cap back and send your soul to new dimensions\n\nThe ammunition only ignited my ignition\n\nMy ambition is only make right decisions on my mission\n\nMy division is separate from my business and my bitches\n\nEvery sentence and line is a reflection of time\n\n\n\nMy times table never was good at the time I was nine\n\nAt seventeen I was forced in a 9 to the 5\n\nSo 9 times out of 10 I'm despising the eyes of the greedy ones\n\nAll around me like some fucking flies\n\nGet away, bye-bye, NSYNC, lie-lie\n\nInstinct, y'all niggas so far from telling me how to live my life\n\nJust suck my dick and bump my shit\n\nAnd stream my shit so I can go and count my grip\n\nReverse the slavery every time I pull out my whip\n\nThen pull up on a racist race like I am the shit\n\nI limp towards the cake 'cause I am the pimp\n\nAin't nobody fuckin' my contracts up like Prince, uh",
