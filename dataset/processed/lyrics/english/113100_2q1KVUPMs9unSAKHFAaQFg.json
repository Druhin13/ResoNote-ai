  "lyrics": "Lies are spoken\r\nWhen the venom crawls inside\r\nFaith is broken\r\nWhen the fire fills our eyes\r\nLove lies hopeless\r\nWhen the hate becomes the high\n\nPain is chosen\n\nWhen the devil comes alive\n\nDaylight (hide?)\n\n\n\nSo save yourself\n\nI leave this world tonight\n\nThere's nothing left\n\nI see the sun rise\n\nMy dying breath\n\nI keep this prayer alive\n\n\n\nRain is closing\n\nWhen you're caught between the lines\n\nFaith is (for ...?)\n\nWhen the hollow fills our eyes\n\nHate lies hopeless\n\nWhen the heart and soul divide\n\nFate is worthless\n\nWhen the shadow comes alive\n\nDaylight (hide?)\n\n\n\nSo save yourself\n\nI leave this world tonight\n\nThere's nothing left\n\nI see the sun rise\n\nMy dying breath\n\nI keep this prayer alive\n\n\n\nSo save yourself\n\nI leave this world tonight\n\nThere's nothing left\n\nI see the sun rise\n\nMy dying breath\n\nI keep this prayer alive",
