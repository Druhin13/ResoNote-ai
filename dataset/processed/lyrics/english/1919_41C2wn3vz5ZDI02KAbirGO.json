  "lyrics": "We had an apartment in the city,\r\nMe and Loretta liked living there.\r\nWell, it'd been years since the kids had grown,\r\nA life of their own left us alone.\r\nJohn and Linda live in Omaha,\r\nAnd Joe is somewhere on the road.\n\nWe lost Davy in the Korean war,\n\nAnd I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nYa' know that old trees just grow stronger,\n\nAnd old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day.\n\nOld people just grow lonesome\n\nWaiting for someone to say, \"Hello in there, hello.\"\n\n\n\nMe and Loretta, we don't talk much more,\n\nShe sits and stares through the back door screen.\n\nAnd all the news just repeats itself\n\nLike some forgotten dream that we've both seen.\n\nSomeday I'll go and call up Rudy,\n\nWe worked together at the factory.\n\nBut what could I say if asks \"What's new?\"\n\n\"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do.\"\n\n\n\nRepeat Chorus:\n\n\n\nSo if you're walking down the street sometime\n\nAnd spot some hollow ancient eyes,\n\nPlease don't just pass 'em by and stare\n\nAs if you didn't care, say, \"Hello in there, hello.\"",
