  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Deliverance par Chvrches\r\nCareful when you're swimmin' in the holy water\nDrowning in your own beliefs\nCareful when you're standing at a broken altar\nAsking if we feel relief\nCareful when you're looking for a true confession\nMirror what you wanna see\nCareful when you're tellin' us about obsessions\nSayin' that we're never free\n\nYou better hold on, hold on, hold\nYou better hold on to what you love\nYou better give up, give up, give up\nYou better give up on giving up\n\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nIf you can never, never change\n\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nIf you hurt me in exchange\n\nTrust me when I tell you 'bout my own convictions\nMade my mind up long ago\nTrust me when I tell you it's a contradiction\nWishin' that I didn't know\nTrust me that I struggle with all your destruction\nScreamin' that I told you so\nTrust me when I talk about the disillusion\nBuilding up and letting go\n\nYou better hold on, hold on, hold\nYou better hold on to what you love\nYou better give up, give up, give up\nYou better give up on giving up\n\n\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nIf you can never, never change\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nIf you hurt me in exchange\n\nLook in my eyes when you say it, say it\nLook in my eyes like you mean it, mean it\nLook in my eyes when you say it, say it\nLook in my eyes like you mean it\n\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nIf you can never, never change\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nIf you hurt me in exchange\n\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nLook in my eyes when you say it, say it\nIf you can never, never change\n\nLook in my eyes like you mean it, mean it\nIt's a deliver-iver-iverance\nLook in my eyes when you say it, say it\nIf you hurt me in exchange\nLook in my eyes like you mean it, mean it, mean it\n\nLike you mean it\nLike you mean it\nLike you mean it",
