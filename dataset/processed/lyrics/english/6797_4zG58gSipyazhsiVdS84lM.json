  "lyrics": "God is not a contract or a guy\r\nGod is an unspecified tide\r\nYou cannot time its tables\r\nIt sets no glass or gables\r\nGod is a lusty tire fire\r\nIts bristles scrape and strike the stage\n\nA rock, paper, scissors' rage\n\nHave mercy on the natural world\n\n\n\nMy voice is not the liquid waves\n\nThe perfect rings around a heron's legs\n\nMy voice is straight garroting wire\n\nA stolen mile of fingerprints\n\nPeeled the quiet from the dunes\n\nCaptured and re-spooled as ruin to be used\n\nAt a different time\n\n\n\nMy voice is a fracture\n\nFor shinbone's lust\n\nPounding barefoot ground\n\nIt lifts you up and sits you just\n\nJust at sorrow's waterline\n\nI drape you on tomorrow's plate\n\nFair as metal, marrow spilling\n\nNot yours but mine\n\nI'm an agent of the natural world\n\n\n\nDon't you tell me I didn't warn you\n\nThat that's some gravity you ought not to play with\n\nDon't you tell me I didn't warn you\n\nThat that's some gravity you ought not to play with\n\n\n\nNothing quite so poison as a promise\n\nNothing quite so poison as a promise\n\nNothing quite so poison as a promise\n\nNothing quite so poison as a promise\n\n\n\nAnd me, I am not a mess\n\nI am a wilderness, yes\n\nThe undiscovered continent for you to undress\n\nBut you'll not be my master\n\nYou're barely my guest\n\nYou don't have permission to take any pictures\n\nBe careful of the natural world\n\n\n\nNature can't amend its ways\n\nBoils along and then replays\n\nDespite heartfelt springtimes of regret\n\nThe storms she still cries for days\n\nHave mercy on the natural world",
