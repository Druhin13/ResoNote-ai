  "lyrics": "Represent, represent!! (repeat 4X)\r\nStraight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle\r\nGet murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggaz tumble\r\nThe corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals\r\nwho don't care, guzzlin beers, we all stare\n\nat the out-of-towners (Ay, yo, yo, who that?) They better break North\n\nbefore we get the four pounders, and take their face off\n\nThe streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasin brothers\n\nThe D.A.'s on the roof, tryin to, watch us and knock us\n\nAnd killer coppers, even come through in helicopters\n\nI drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for\n\nthe fronters, wannabe ill niggaz and spot runners\n\nThinkin it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em\n\nand leave em done, won't even run about Gods\n\nI don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards\n\nNas is a rebel of the street corner\n\nPullin a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure\n\n\n\nRepresent, represent!! (repeat 4X)\n\n\n\nYo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella\n\nMoet drinkin, marijuana smokin street dweller\n\nwho's always on the corner, rollin up blessed\n\nWhen I dress, it's never nuttin less than Guess\n\nCold be walkin with a bop and my hat turned back\n\nLove committin sins and my friends sell crack\n\nThis nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue\n\nThe school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one\n\ncause life ain't shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts\n\nSo I guzzle my Hennesey while pullin on mad blunts\n\nThe brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator\n\nThe type of nigga who be pissin in your elevator\n\nSomehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game\n\nUsed to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames\n\nNow I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs\n\nFly new chicKs and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's\n\n\n\nRepresent, represent!! (repeat 3X)\n\n\n\nNo doubt; see my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about\n\nBefore the BDP conflict with MC Shan\n\nAround the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane\n\nI used to wake up every mornin, see my crew on the block\n\nEvery day's a different plan that had us runnin from cops\n\nIf it wasn't hangin out in front of cocaine spots\n\nWe was at the candy factory, breakin the locks\n\nNowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man\n\nFuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand\n\nCould use a gun Son, but fuck bein the wanted man\n\nbut if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam\n\nThen call the crew to get live too\n\nwith Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow\n\nMike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit\n\nMy shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it\n\nIt's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs\n\nNuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, One Love\n\n\n\nRepresent y'all, represent!! (repeat 4X)\n\n\n\nOne time for your motherfuckin mind\n\nThis goes out to everybody in New York\n\nthat's livin the real fuckin life\n\nAnd every projects, all over\n\nTo my man, Big Will he's still here *echoes*\n\nThe 40 side of Vernon\n\nMy man Big L.E.S.\n\nBig Cee-Lo from the Don\n\nShawn Penn, the 40 busters\n\nMy crew the shorty busters\n\nThe 41st side of Vernon posse\n\nThe Goodfellas\n\nMy man Cormega, Lakid Kid\n\nCan't forget Drawers, the Hillbillies\n\nMy man Slate, Wallethead\n\nBlack Jay, Big Oogi\n\nCrazy barrio spot (Big Dove)\n\nWe rock shit, Ph.D\n\nAnd my man Primo, from GangStarr\n\n(Ninety-four real shit y'all, Harry O!)\n\nFuck y'all crab ass niggaz though...\n\n(Yeah, bitch ass niggas! *etc.*)",
