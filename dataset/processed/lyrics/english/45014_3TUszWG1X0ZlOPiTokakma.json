  "lyrics": "I've got a job that doesn't pay enough\nI've got a boss that works me too hard\nYou got lovers that you never have seen\nWe've got expensive tastes and minimum salaries\n\nSmile if it hurts you\n\nLiar if it hurts you\n\n\n\nMuscle top, hit the tag\n\nOne more dance on the check\n\nGive me love, make it red\n\nHave a night you won't forget\n\n\n\nParty on the weekend\n\nA late night with good friends\n\nYou jumped to the pool, you got in the van\n\nThe pills in the bottle, the sounds of the band\n\nParty on the weekend\n\nA party on the weekend\n\n(Party on)\n\n\n\nI've got a mess of freaks I call friends\n\nI've got a POC cutting it for the best\n\nI caught her eyes, thought I'd never have seen\n\nBecause the government's bleeding me through my teeth\n\n\n\nSmile if it hurts you\n\nLiar if it hurts you\n\n\n\nMuscle top, hit the tag\n\nOne more dance on the check\n\nGive me love, make it red\n\nHave a night you won't forget\n\n\n\nParty on the weekend\n\nA late night with good friends\n\nYou jumped to the pool, you got in the van\n\nThe pills in the bottle, the sounds of the band\n\nParty on the weekend\n\nA party on the weekend\n\n\n\nNo they left us standing with a drink in our hands\n\nHolding white picket pieces, a perfect sham\n\nWe're a scandal, the Hollywood bad boys\n\nThe ruins youth, the island of lost toys\n\n\n\nYou know sometimes when the air gets cold\n\nYou feel the shape in the sheets, the footprints on the coast\n\nIt's our best defense just to crawl in our beds\n\nOr slip in new oceans, howl the words that we said\n\n\n\nWell forget that, there is no show\n\nI said forget that, it bites too hard\n\nI'm tired with a sad face, had it with a bad taste\n\nThis is going my way, I'm gonna party\n\n\n\nParty on the weekend\n\nA late night with good friends\n\nYou jumped to the pool, you got in the van\n\nThe pills in the bottle, the sounds of the band\n\nShooting them Colts, kicking the can\n\nWe're younger now that we've ever been\n\nParty on the weekend (Party)\n\nA party on the weekend (Party)\n\nA party on the weekend (Party)\n\nA party on the weekend (Party)\n\n\n\nParty on... the weekend\n\nParty on... the weekend",
