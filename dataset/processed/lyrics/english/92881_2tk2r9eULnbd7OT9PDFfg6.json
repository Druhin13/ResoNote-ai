  "lyrics": "The kids round here stuck in their teens\r\nChasing the notion that's in between\r\nThe feeling you get when you're hypnotised\r\nAnd the feeling you get looking in snake eyes\r\nIt's not what you want, that's the way that it seems\n\nTurning up while you turn up your jeans\n\nIt's harder to see when you improvise\n\nAnd it's harder to run when you feel tongue tied\n\n\n\nBy the yes and the no, that helps you let go\n\nAnd feel alright for days\n\n\n\nTell me what you wanted\n\nAnd then tell me how to be it\n\nThrough the constant \"hello\"s and \"we won't let go\"s\n\nThe heart's in between the X's and O's\n\nTell me when it's okay\n\nHiding happiness in clichés\n\nDrop me down to my knees, fill my memories\n\nBecause we all need a little bit of tigerblood\n\n\n\nIs it real, is it not and do I mind?\n\nIs it everything you hoped to find?\n\nTurned to me and then replied\n\nIs it just so wrong to fantasise\n\nAbout the times when we felt alive?\n\nHolding up, holding out, holding on for the ride\n\nScreaming \"oh my god\" looking to the skies\n\nWanna feel, wanna love, wanna recognise\n\n\n\nThat the things I don't miss, make me reminisce\n\nAnd feel alright for days\n\n\n\nTell me what you wanted\n\nAnd then tell me how to be it\n\nThrough the constant \"hello\"s and \"we won't let go\"s\n\nThe heart's in between the X's and O's\n\nTell me when it's okay\n\nHiding happiness in clichés\n\nDrop me down to my knees, fill my memories\n\nBecause we all need a little bit of tigerblood\n\n\n\n\n\nTell me what you wanted\n\nAnd then tell me how to be it\n\nThrough the constant \"hello\"s and \"we won't let go\"s\n\nThe heart's in between the X's and O's\n\nTell me when it's okay\n\nHiding happiness in clichés\n\nDrop me down to my knees, fill my memories\n\nBecause we all need a little bit of tigerblood",
