(That special recipe)\n\nWhat do you drink?\n\nPlease tell me what you eat\n\nAnd I whispered in his ear and said that secret's safe with me\n\n\n\nEvery time you come over\n\nYou always end up under you\n\nCould've been a scuba diver\n\nWhen you're done call your Uber driver\n\nYou can't stay up no longer\n\nDon't you call this number\n\nThey say when it rains it pours but\n\nI bet you never felt this thunder\n\n\n\nOMG he can't breathe damn he's drowning\n\nIn my deep, deep blue sea where they found him\n\nOMG he can't breathe damn he's drowning\n\nIn my deep, deep blue sea where they found him\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last time you came over, I told you you're my lover\n\nTruth is I'm a liar that was a one-nighter\n\nYeah that head was fire but your time is up expired\n\nThey say when it rains it pours but\n\nI bet you never felt this thunder\n\n\n\nOMG he can't breathe damn he's drowning\n\nIn my deep, deep blue sea where they found him\n\nOMG he can't breathe damn he's drowning\n\nIn my deep, deep blue sea where they found him\n\n\n\nWhere they found him\n\nHe can't breathe\n\nHe can't breathe\n\nHe can't breathe\n\nOh no...",
