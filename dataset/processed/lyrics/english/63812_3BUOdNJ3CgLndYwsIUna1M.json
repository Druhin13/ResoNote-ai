  "lyrics": "She's making the brink, kicking the fight\r\nSeizing the day, owning the night\r\nShe's taking the wheel, jumping the track\r\nMakes 'em all say...\r\nGET BACK!\n\n\n\nShe's just a girl used to taking the stairs, when she's like that nobody cares\n\nIn her too high heels and her too short skirts, keeps her from blocking the jeers and clocking the flirts\n\nShe's on her own down to shout it, they just can't stop from talking 'bout it\n\n\n\nIntroducing our newest line of modern woman doll! Sings all by herself when you take her out of the box!\n\n\n\nThey say that girl she evil, that's how they know she evil\n\nThey say that girl she evil, They say that girl she evil\n\nThat's how they know she evil\n\n\n\nShe evil!\n\n\n\nThey want her number but she's caught in the crossfire, she signs a \"Thanks for nothing Julie Newmar!\"\n\n\n\nThe lady does just what she wanna, causing efforts making way like shes a prima donna\n\nNever not the main attraction, the girl can't get no satisfaction!\n\n\n\nWe've secretly replaced his girlfriend with our fresh new brand, Let's see if he can handle a taste this sharp\n\n\n\nThey say that girl she evil, that's how they know she evil\n\nThey say that girl she evil, They say that girl she evil\n\nThat's how they know she evil\n\n\n\nShe is capital E-vil\n\n\n\nThey say that girl she evil, that's how they know she evil\n\nThey say that girl she evil, They say that girl she evil\n\nThat's how they know she evil",
