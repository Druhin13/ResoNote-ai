  "lyrics": "Downwards, search and you shall find\r\nCertain as the setting sun was so descent\r\nBut the deeps are old and without end\r\nThere's more than darkness in them\r\nMore than a heart may hold\n\nMore than man may learn\n\nBefore the eyes of a god\n\nIn judgement stern\n\n\n\nDown there\n\nYou shall reap what you have sown\n\n\n\nThere flow the rivers of our being out of sight\n\nInto never ending night\n\n\n\nAll we have ever known\n\nAll that was and is to come\n\nAnd all which never came to pass\n\nIn that abyss alike extinguished\n\n\n\nDown there\n\nAll that a heart may hold\n\nAll that man may learn\n\nIn that piercing light\n\nTo ashes turn\n\n\n\nYet without fear\n\nWe must journey there\n\nAnd stand erect\n\nBefore the lidless stare",
