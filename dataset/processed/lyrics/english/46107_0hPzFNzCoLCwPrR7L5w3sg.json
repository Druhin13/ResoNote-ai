Waitin' for an open door\r\nNorth or South, better life, never taking touch control\r\nIn start, I can feel the force just pulling me off the floor\r\nWho dares to come out with me? I cannot do this alone\r\nHey-ya, you can't get any higher stain 'bout where you are\n\nHey-ya, take the head off this fight, I know we'll go so far\n\nHey-ya\n\n\n\nYou're the reason in my life to move on\n\nI'm no stranger take the night, sing this song\n\nYou and me just naturally side by side\n\nTake a risk right here, right no sign on tonight\n\n\n\nNever been an easy road, but let me show you how it's done (It's done)\n\nDarker days, I've got to go, let our fly be on the sun\n\nIt starts so you can feel the power flowing into your veins\n\nHere you are, you can see them watch or you can play the game\n\n\n\nHey-ya, you can get any higher stain 'bout where you are\n\nHey-ya, take the head off this fight, I know we'll go so far\n\nHey-ya\n\n\n\nYou're the reason in my life to move on\n\nI'm no stranger take the night, sing this song\n\nYou and me just naturally side by side\n\nTake a risk right here, right no sign on tonight\n\n\n\nYou can get any higher\n\nStay in when where you are\n\nTake the end of this fight\n\nI know we'll go so far\n\nGive a little, give a lot\n\nNo matter where you are born\n\nIt's a rise in taking a shot\n\n\n\nYou're the reason in my life to move on\n\nI'm no stranger take the night, sing this song\n\nYou and me just naturally side by side\n\nTake a risk right here, right no sign on tonight\n\n\n\nOh, take your risk right now\n\nI give a little, I give a lot\n\nAnd take your risk right now\n\nNo matter where you are born\n\nI'll take a risk right now\n\nYou and me just naturally side by side\n\nTake a risk my tear right no sign on tonight\n\nSign on tonight",
