  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Happier par Marshmello\r\nLately, I've been, I've been thinking\nI want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\nWhen the morning comes\nWhen we see what we've become\nIn the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind\nNot the fire that we've begun\nEvery argument, every word we can't take back\n'Cause with all that has happened\nI think that we both know the way that the story ends\n\nThen only for a minute\nI want to change my mind\n\n'Cause this just don't feel right to me\nI want to raise your spirits\nI want to see you smile but\nKnow that means I'll have to leave\n\nKnow that means I'll have to leave\nLately, I've been, I've been thinking\nI want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\nWhen the evening falls\nAnd I'm left there with my thoughts\nAnd the image of you being with someone else\nWell, it's eating me up inside\nBut we ran our course, we pretended we're okay\nNow if we jump together at least we can swim\nFar away from the wreck we made\n\n\nThen only for a minute\nI want to change my mind\n'Cause this just don't feel right to me\nI want to raise your spirits\nI want to see you smile but\nKnow that means I'll have to leave\n\nKnow that means I'll have to leave\nLately, I've been, I've been thinking\nI want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\nSo I'll go, I'll go\nI will go, go, go\nSo I'll go, I'll go\nI will go, go, go\n\nLately, I've been, I've been thinking\n\nI want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\nEven though I might not like this\nI think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier\n\nThen only for a minute\nI want to change my mind\n'Cause this just don't feel right to me\nI want to raise your spirits\nI want to see you smile but\nKnow that means I'll have to leave\n\nKnow that means I'll have to leave\nLately, I've been, I've been thinking\nI want you to be happier, I want you to be happier\n\n\nSo I'll go, I'll go\nI will go, go, go",
