  "lyrics": "I lose a bit of myself with every selfie\r\nLose sleep over wealth, it's not healthy\r\nFinding a new religion on Yelp to come help me\r\nPraying to the label itself, \"Do not shelf me\"\r\nIn the middle with the beggars and rejects\n\nReading between text with weed, liquor, and sex\n\nShe say she love me at dusk, but at dawn\n\nI pack up my things and I'm gone\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know where I'm gonna go\n\nBut I don't care, I'm on the road\n\nNever been a perfect soul\n\nBut I will not apologize\n\n\n\nBeen a lot of places in this life\n\nAnd I did a lot wrong I can't make right\n\nNever been a perfect soul\n\nBut I will not apologize\n\n\n\nSaid I will not apologize\n\n\n\nImperfect, I'm imperfect\n\nNo road map, getting lost on purpose\n\nPhone no service, but it's clear out here\n\nI'm living with nothing to fear out here\n\n\n\nThere's lessons you learn\n\nBridges you burn\n\nAll for the cost of a dollar to earn\n\nAnd they say they love me at dusk, but at dawn\n\nI pack up my things and I'm gone\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know where I'm gonna go\n\nBut I don't care, I'm on the road\n\nNever been a perfect soul\n\nBut I will not apologize\n\n\n\nBeen a lot of places in this life\n\nAnd I did a lot wrong I can't make right\n\nNever been a perfect soul\n\nBut I will not apologize\n\n\n\nSaid I will not apologize\n\nAnd I will not apologize\n\n\n\nI don't know where I'm gonna go\n\nBut I don't care, I'm on the road\n\nNever been a perfect soul\n\nBut I will not apologize\n\n\n\nBeen a lot of places in this life\n\nAnd I did a lot wrong I can't make right\n\nNever been a perfect soul\n\nBut I will not apologize\n\n\n\nSaid I will not apologize\n\nSaid I will not apologize",
