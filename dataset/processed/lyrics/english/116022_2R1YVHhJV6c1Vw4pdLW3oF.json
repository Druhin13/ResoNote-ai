  "lyrics": "I want love, but it's impossible\r\nA man like me, so irresponsible\r\nA man like me is dead in places\r\nOther men feel liberated\r\nI can't love, shot full of holes\n\nDon't feel nothing, I just feel cold\n\nDon't feel nothing, just old scars\n\nToughening up around my heart\n\n\n\nBut I want love, just a different kind\n\nI want love, won't bring me down\n\nWon't brick me up, won't fence me in\n\nI want a love, that don't mean a thing\n\nThat's the love I want, I want love\n\n\n\nI want love on my own terms\n\nAfter everything I've ever learned\n\nMe, I carry too much baggage\n\nOh man I've seen so much traffic\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I want love, just a different kind\n\nI want love, won't bring me down\n\nWon't brick me up, won't fence me in\n\nI want a love, that don't mean a thing\n\nThat's the love I want, I want love\n\n\n\nSo bring it on, I've been bruised\n\nDon't give me love that's clean and smooth\n\nI'm ready for the rougher stuff\n\nNo sweet romance, I've had enough\n\n\n\nA man like me is dead in places\n\nOther men feel liberated\n\n\n\nBut I want love, just a different kind\n\nI want love, won't bring me down\n\nWon't break me up, won't fence me in\n\nI want a love, that don't mean a thing\n\nThat's the love I want, I want love\n\n\n\nBut I want love, just a different kind\n\nI want love, won't bring me down\n\nWon't break me up, won't fence me in\n\nI want a love, that don't mean a thing\n\nThat's the love I want, I want love",
