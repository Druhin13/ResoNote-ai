  "lyrics": "17, way too young for love\r\nBut I couldn't think of nothing else\r\nI got mine, I never gave anything away\r\nI was just thinking of myself\r\nAll the times you said you'd love me\n\nI never gave you my reply\n\nHad a dream it was over\n\nAnd I woke up with a pain inside\n\nAnd I didn't tell you and I don't know why, why, why\n\n\n\n'Cause you're so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful to me\n\nAnd you're everything that I'd ever need\n\nIt was a shame I couldn't see\n\nAnd now that I've told you, I feel so free\n\n'Cause you're so beautiful to me\n\n\n\nTimes moved on, I'm much older\n\nI guess I've learned from my mistakes\n\nFor the first time, I think I know who I am\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I made you mad, baby\n\n\n\n'Cause you're so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful to me\n\nAnd you're everything that I'd ever need\n\nIt was a shame I couldn't see\n\nAnd now that I've told you, I feel so free\n\n'Cause you're so beautiful, so beautiful to me\n\n\n\nAnd if you leave me now, I won't be surprised\n\nIf you stay, well, I'll no longer hide\n\n\n\n'Cause you're so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful to me\n\nAnd you're everything that I'd ever need\n\nIt was a shame I couldn't see\n\nAnd now that I've told you, I feel so free\n\n'Cause you're so beautiful, you're so so beautiful to me\n\n\n\nTo me, to me, to me, to me, to me",
