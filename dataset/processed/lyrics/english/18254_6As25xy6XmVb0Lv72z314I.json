  "lyrics": "I look at my watch for the time this second\r\nBut then at my phone to confirm it's true\r\nShe comes back in from the bathroom smelling\r\nThe same as before but I guess a bit new\r\n\"There's no such thing as a joke\" she says\r\nThere's only jest with the truth\r\nBut she accepts the apology I never said\r\nAnd I get on with attempting to be cute\r\nHer eyes look photoshopped catch like wet\r\nCould see the reflection back behind my head\r\nEvery time her eyes closed I dreamed a whole thread\r\nThat reality was better than the truth\r\nI said \"I hope girls will start to\r\ninstead cos' now men can't try the first move\"\r\nI knew it wasn't clever it was wrong saying 'owt\r\nHer eyes rolled like a fruit machine not paying out\r\nShe said \"Don't be that guy when we've only just\r\nmet. Don't try the trousers of what doesn't suit you\"\r\nYou are not the voice in your head\r\nYou're the one who listens to it\r\nShe checked her feed and I grabbed at the menu\r\nAnd I felt like a child letting go of a balloon\r\nI said \"It's just too hard to know how to tread.\r\nI mean more time guys that just try to keep it moving.\r\nNo more time guys become an all over rash and\r\nit takes you by shock if it's just fucking ew\"\r\nI was leaning in to try and get a little bit friendly\r\nWe were shooting up the bar with arrows of cupid\r\nWondered whether she felt like she was sitting in a bath\r\nAnd then moved and was cold and was covered in goosebumps\r\nSaid if me and her threw our problems on a stack\r\nI would see hers and I would want mine back\r\nYou are not the voice in your head\r\nYou're the one who listens to it\r\nYou are not the voice in your head\r\nYou're the one who listens to it\r\nIn the real world girls aren't making moves\r\nSomeone needs to if we want the race to continue\r\nI pointed but we almost near enough touched\r\nShe remained still and didn't duck when we didn't touch\r\nYou're all lost\r\nYou're eating sweets at the seaside\r\nWhen we need to be free so we can free you guys\r\nYou kissed the toy then avoid what's important\r\nYou missed the point like you missed the toilet\r\nAwkward\r\nThirsty\r\nTrying to corner off\r\nShe caught me at my worst like the boy in my corner shop\r\nHow the hell's a man supposed to know why you are saying things\r\nWhen it is against the rules to find out straight\r\nDespite what it might seem like it's fucking implicit\r\nWhat someone thinks about you is none of your business\r\nYou are not the voice in your head\r\nYou're the one who listens to it\r\nYou are not the voice in your head\r\nYou're the one who listens to it",
