  "lyrics": "All alone again [x2]\r\nI speak as if I'd last one minute\r\nMy eyes are fixed upon this screen\r\nStalking the girls I could never f**k\r\nI mean they're sluts but it seems I lack that luck\r\nAnd I'm not the man to wash my hands\n\nAll alone or acting like we've hit it off\n\nCuz either way I'm just jerkin someone off\n\nTo whip dicks out and pissin'\n\nTill you leave town wishing. NO!!!\n\nI won't be satisfied\n\n\n\n[Chorus]\n\n\n\nThings are gonna be different now you see\n\nAnd add to all this dirty laundry you left me\n\nIts' getting air and with heavy rotation\n\nYou'd better have a damn good explanation\n\nYou act as though you have lived a life\n\nBecause you're a tad bit over cooked\n\nBut I've been burned and burned\n\nAND BURNED AND BURNED!!!\n\n\n\n[Drum solo]\n\n\n\nAnd now every single day,\n\nI look more like my father\n\nI've only got so many layers\n\nAnd it's only getting hotter\n\nTo whip dicks out and pissin'\n\nTill you leave town wishing. NO!!!\n\nI won't be satisfied\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n\n\nI didn't mean to be so forward\n\nThere are some things you should know\n\nHe loves you like a truck stop screw\n\nWhen you're alone he adores me\n\nYou'd best get it straight say it\n\nWhen you're all dressed you just bore me [x2]\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Maddy for these lyrics)",
