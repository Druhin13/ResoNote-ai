  "lyrics": "I believe that children are our future;\nTeach them well and let them lead the way.\nShow them all the beauty they possess inside.\nGive them a sense of pride, to make it easier;\nLet the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.\n\n\nEverybody's searching for a hero;\n\nPeople need someone to look up to.\n\nI never found anyone who fulfilled my need.\n\nA lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.\n\n\n\nI decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.\n\nIf I fail, if I succeed. \n\nAt least I lived as I believe. \n\nNo matter what they take from me,\n\nThey can't take away my dignity.\n\n\n\nBecause the greatest love of all is happening to me.\n\nI found the greatest love of all inside of me.\n\nThe greatest love of all is easy to achieve.\n\nLearning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.\n\n\n\nI believe that children are our future;\n\nTeach them well and let them lead the way.\n\nShow them all the beauty they possess inside.\n\nGive them a sense of pride, to make it easier;\n\nLet the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.\n\n\n\nI decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.\n\nIf I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believe. \n\nNo matter what they take from me,\n\nThey can't take away my dignity.\n\n\n\nBecause the greatest love of all is happening to me.\n\nI found the greatest love of all inside of me.\n\nThe greatest love of all is easy to achieve.\n\nLearning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.\n\n\n\nAnd if by chance that special place that you've been dreaming of\n\nLead you to a lonely place \n\nFind your strength in love",
