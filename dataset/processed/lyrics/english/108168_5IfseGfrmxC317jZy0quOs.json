  "lyrics": "I like the way your sparkling earrings lay, \nagainst your skin, it's so brown \nand I wanna sleep with you \nin the desert tonight \nwith a billion stars all around \n'cause I gotta peaceful easy feeling \n\nand I know you won't let me down \n\n'cause I'm already standing on the \n\nground \n\nAnd I found out a long time ago \n\nwhat a woman can do to your soul \n\nAh, but she can't take you anyway \n\nYou don't already know how to go \n\nand I gotta peaceful, easy feeling \n\nand I know you won't let me down \n\n'cause I'm already standing on the ground \n\nI get this feeling I may know you \n\nas a lover and a friend \n\nbut this voice keeps whispering \n\nin my other ear, tells me \n\nI may never see you again \n\n'cause I get a peaceful, easy feeling \n\nand I know you won't let me down \n\n'cause I'm already standing on the ground \n\n'cause I'm already standing... \n\non the ground \n\noooo, oooo",
