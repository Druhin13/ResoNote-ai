  "lyrics": "The image in your eyes, reflecting the pain that has taken you\r\nI hear it in your voice so ridden with shame from what's ailing you\r\nI won't give up, so don't give in\r\nYou've fallen down but you can rise again\r\nSo don't give up\n\n\n\nWhen the demon that's inside you is ready to begin\n\nAnd it feels like it's a battle that you will never win\n\nWhen you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin\n\nWhen there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight\n\n\n\nLost in your world of lies I find it so hard to believe in you\n\nCan it be real this time, or just a part of this game that we're playing through\n\n\n\nI won't give up, so don't give in\n\nYou've fallen down but you will rise again\n\nI won't give up\n\n\n\nWhen the demon that's inside you is ready to begin\n\nAnd it feels like it's a battle that you will never win\n\nWhen you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin\n\nWhen there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight\n\n\n\nDon't let it take your soul\n\nLook at me, take control\n\nWhen going to fight this war\n\nThis is nothing worth dying for\n\n\n\nAre you ready to begin\n\nThis is a battle that we are going to win\n\n\n\nWhen you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin\n\nWhen there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason\n\n\n\nWhen the demon that's inside you is ready to begin\n\nAnd it feels like it's a battle that you will never win\n\nWhen you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin\n\nWhen there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight\n\nI'll be your reason to fight\n\nGive you a reason to fight",
