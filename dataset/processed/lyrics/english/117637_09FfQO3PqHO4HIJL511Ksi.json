Sike\n\n\n\nSuck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch\n\nSuck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man\n\nI hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck\n\nSuck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch\n\n\n\nI play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael Polar\n\nYou tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa\n\nLa próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola\n\nEstas de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola\n\n\n\nI'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh), everything over-affects me (yeah)\n\nWhen you joke it upsets me (yeah), you say I'm no good at sex\n\nAnd you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh)\n\nI need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (yep)\n\nYou hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep)\n\nBitch, you was supposed to correct me! (oh)\n\nBeen textin' you since three, I still get no fucking reply\n\nYou say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size\n\nFuck you goin' in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch\n\nI doubt that you're goin' to house sit\n\nIn that outfit, no skin-tight Levi's\n\nEvery word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie\n\nOh, it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot\n\nYou say, \"Don't come over\" 'cause you got pink eye\n\nBut I think I got just the thing, why\n\nDon't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?",
