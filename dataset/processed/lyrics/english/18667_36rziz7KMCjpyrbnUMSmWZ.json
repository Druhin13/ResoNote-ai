  "lyrics": "It was the last time I felt like this\r\nI've felt nothing at all\r\nAnd I was 15 when you got sick\r\nI still remember that phone call\r\nThey said there's something inside of you\n\nSo they tried radiation, chemicals too\n\nAnd now you're standing on the last line\n\nAnd so am I\n\nI've got you\n\nYou've got me too\n\nOh I've got you\n\n\n\nAnd you said there's broken links in your brain\n\nAnd I said it's okay, mines exactly the same\n\nThere's still some things I don't understand\n\nLike the casual blindness toward the cruelty of man\n\n\n\nAnd a cop shot the wrong guy again\n\nAnd they tore down a childhood home again\n\nOh, nobody seemed to blink an eye\n\nWhen they wanted you to pay to see the sky alive\n\nRunning out of time\n\nYou're still running for your life\n\n\n\nThese days I wish you could forget\n\nWhen the broken glass cut open my arm and my chest\n\nAnd you just held me down\n\nAs the needle went in and out\n\n\n\nAnd mum was retracing her steps\n\nWhen the doctor asked her for a cigarette\n\nA two-year-old child in a hospital bed\n\nI will never run with glass again\n\nJust like you said\n\nDon't be an idiot\n\n\n\nI know that when you go\n\nPart of me will go with you to the infinite unknown\n\nAnd we'll stand at the edge of the divide\n\nI will hold your hand and together we'll dive\n\n\n\nAnd I will never meet a man\n\nThat can make me question life the way you can\n\nA defender of freedom\n\nAn advocate for truth\n\nI'm so proud that half of me grew from you\n\nAll the broken parts too\n\nI've got you\n\n\n\nI will always hear your voice when I speak\n\nI will always see your face in me\n\nI will always hear your voice when I speak\n\nI will always see your face in me\n\n\n\nWe never found the Subway\n\nWe never found the Subway\n\nWe never found the Subway\n\n\n\n\"Alright, I'm done\"",
