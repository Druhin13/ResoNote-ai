  "lyrics": "I couldn't help but notice you were sitting by yourself\r\nDropping limes in a Corona like you're trying to get over somebody else\r\nIt's funny how you're story sounds a little like mine\r\nOh, cause' I've been at a table with a bottle peeling labels to pass the time\r\nWe can be blue eyes and neon light\n\nSinging them sad up songs all night\n\nWe can say goodbye, just head home\n\nBut, if we're going to be alone\n\n\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nKissing over there in the corner where nobody else can see\n\nKeeping each other company\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nLeaning up against my car door parked outside on the street, where it's just you and me\n\nWe should be alone together\n\n\n\nI couldn't help but notice you could use another drink\n\nYeah, I don't wanna leave ya\n\nAnd it's two for one Tequila so what you think?\n\n\n\nWe can be blue eyes and neon light\n\nSinging them sad up songs all night\n\nWe can say goodbye, just head home\n\nBut, if we're going to be alone\n\n\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nKissing over there in the corner where nobody else can see\n\nKeeping each other company\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nLeaning up against my car door parked outside on the street, where it's just you and me\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nWe should be alone together, oh yeah\n\n\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nOver there in the corner where nobody else can see\n\n\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nKissing over there in the corner where nobody else can see\n\nKeeping each other company\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nLeaning up against my car door parked outside on the street, where it's just you and me\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nWe should be alone together\n\nWe should be alone together, oh yeah\n\nWe should be alone together",
