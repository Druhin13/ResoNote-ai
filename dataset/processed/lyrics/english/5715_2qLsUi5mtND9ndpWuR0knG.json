  "lyrics": "You used to be the only one in this town who stood by me\r\nLately you’re doing everything that you can to remind me\r\nWith your late night texts, talking to my friends\r\nAsking if I’m coming around\r\nI know you told ‘em you already moved on\n\nBut you're lying, oh lying\n\n\n\n3am, you’re in bed and you’re lonely\n\nAnd you’re wishing that I’d fill the space in your room\n\nYou should know that it’s hard on me baby\n\nSo there’s one thing, one thing that you shouldn’t do\n\nDon’t call me\n\n\n\nWhy make it harder than it already is, it’s beyond me\n\nYou’re like my shadow, everywhere that I go you still find me\n\n\n\nI can’t sleep at all, with my phone blown up\n\nCause your voice still rings in my head\n\nI know you’re hung up on me baby\n\nBut please stop trying, so when it’s…\n\n\n\n3am, you’re in bed and you’re lonely\n\nAnd you’re wishing that I’d fill the space in your room\n\nYou should know that it’s hard on me baby\n\nSo there’s one thing, one thing that you shouldn’t do\n\nDon’t call me\n\n\n\nNo don’t call me, don’t call me\n\nIf you do I’ll be back where I started\n\nNow I’m too weak, I’m too weak\n\n\n\nSo when its 3am, I’m in bed and I’m lonely\n\nAnd I’m wishing that you’d fill the space in my room\n\nDon’t you know that it’s hard on me baby\n\nSo there’s one thing, one thing that you shouldn’t do\n\nDon’t call me",
