  "lyrics": "I been spending my days with my thumb in the air\r\nAnd people been telling me, \"Son, you ain't getting nowhere\"\r\nI shuffle my feet purely out of despair\r\nAnd now I'm moving to you, and this I know, my dear\r\nWell, I see fields of green, dead and yellow too\n\nWaters bleeding red, oh, and seas of blue\n\nI tend to close my eyes and let the wind take me there\n\nNow I'm lost and moving without a care",
