  "lyrics": "Well he was Thailand based\r\nShe was an airforce wife\r\nHe used to fly weekends\r\nIt was the easy life\r\nBut then it turned around\r\nAnd he began to change\n\nShe didn't wonder then\n\nShe didn't think it strange\n\nBut then he got a call\n\nHe had to leave that night\n\nHe couldn't say too much\n\nBut it would be alright\n\nHe didn't need to pack\n\nThey'd meet the next night\n\nHe had a job to do\n\nFlying to Cambodia\n\n\n\nAnd as the nights passed by\n\nShe tried to trace the past\n\nThe way he used to look\n\nThe way he used to laugh\n\nI guess she'll never know\n\nWhat got inside his soul\n\nShe couldn't make it out\n\nJust couldn't take it all\n\nHe had the saddest eyes\n\nThe girl had ever seen\n\nHe used to cry some nights\n\nAs though he lived a dream\n\nAnd as she held him close\n\nHe used to search her face\n\nAs though she knew the truth\n\nLost inside Cambodia\n\n\n\nBut then a call came through\n\nThey said he'd soon be home\n\nShe had to pack a case\n\nAnd they would make a rendez-vous\n\nBut now a year has passed\n\nAnd not a single word\n\nAnd all the love she knew\n\nHas disappeared out in the haze\n\nCambodia - Don't cry now - No tears now\n\n\n\nAnd now the years have passed\n\nWith not a single word\n\nBut there is only one thing left\n\nI know for sure\n\nShe won't see his face again",
