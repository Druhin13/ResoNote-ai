tidals like Jay-Z\n\nThat's a roll offshore like an A.P., Davy\n\nJones' locker on top of those hoppers off the side of the ship\n\nSuicide, didn't die from the dip\n\nSubmarine man, keep your eyes on the blips\n\nSonar, echo, location, and where we are facin'\n\nGet back to our nation, oh Lord\n\nSo we walkin' back to Africa\n\nAnd I found a detour to the seashore\n\nYes, jumped off the deck\n\nTo leave footsteps on the depths of the sea floor, ayy\n\n\n\nMy bones is where the beach is white\n\nWhere the beach is white cause they bleached us light\n\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\n\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\n\nWow, walkin' on water\n\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\n\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\n\nWow, wow, walkin' on water, ayy\n\nMy bones

we looked it in the eyes\n\nLike how could you help her?\n\nBut sigh and apologize and said that I'm sorry, we're shelter\n\nY'all can live down here forever, drownin' and severed\n\nFrom all your lungs and the lungs of your sons\n\nTell your daughters the water's a treasure\n\nSummon the forest\n\nTalkin' to trees like how could you be in the chorus\n\nWith something so horrid?\n\nYou became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships\n\nAnthropomorphic, the forest returned with a match\n\nMade from itself and said, \"Burn us with that\"\n\nThen left again and came back with an axe\n\nWe can serve you as furniture or furnace us black, ayy\n\n\n\nMy bones is where the beach is white\n\nWhere the beach is white cause they bleached us light\n\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\n\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my feet just like Jesus Christ\n\nWow, walkin' on water\n\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\n\nWow, wow, walkin' on water\n\nWow, wow, walkin' on water,

baiters\n\nSupposed to do greater, with all of your alphas and betas\n\nAnd minors and majors\n\nYou were so busy just tryin' to shine\n\nYou shoulda been tryin' to save us\n\nStar said, \"Excuse our behavior\n\nWe will be indebted to you for all of eternity\n\nIf you cancelled your heart and forgave us\n\nRemove all our favors from childrens of sailors and slavers\n\nRepay you with acres\n\nBut here in the heavens where harvest is greater\n\nA meager inheritance, pardon our arrogance\n\nThose with Americans, guide them to places much safer, ayy\"\n\n\n\nMy bones is where the beach is
