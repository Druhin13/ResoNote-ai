  "lyrics": "Another day, another breath (another breath)\r\nBeen chasing dreams, but I never slept (I never slept)\r\nI got a new attitude and a lease on life\r\nAnd some peace of mind\r\nSeek and I find I can sleep when I die\r\nWanna piece of the pie, grab the keys to the ride\r\nAnd I'm straight\r\nI'm on my wave, I'm on my wave\r\nGet out my wake, I'm running late, what can I say?\r\nI heard you die twice, once when they bury you in the grave\r\nAnd the second time is the last time that somebody mentions your name\r\nSo when I leave here on this earth, did I take more than I gave?\r\nDid I look out for the people or did I do it all for fame?\r\nLegend, it's exodus searching for euphoria\r\nTrudging through the mud to find the present, no ignoring us\r\nGot 20, 000 deep off in the street like we some warriors\r\nMy mama told me never bow your head, woo!\r\nI feel glorious, glorious\r\nGot a chance to start again\r\nI was born for this, born for this\r\nIt's who I am, how could I forget?\r\nI made it through the darkest part of the night\r\nAnd now I see the sunrise\r\nNow I feel glorious, glorious\r\nI feel glorious, glorious\r\nWe gon' be alright, put that on my life\r\nWhen I open my eyes, hope I see you shine\r\nWe're planting a flag they don't understand\r\nThe world is up for grabs (Hey, hey, hey)\r\nWe gon' be alright, put that on my life\r\nWhen I open my eyes, hope I see you shine\r\nWe're planting a flag they don't understand\r\nThe world is up for grabs\r\nI feel glorious, glorious\r\nGot a chance to start again\r\nI was born for this, born for this\r\nIt's who I am, how could I forget?\r\nI made it through the darkest part of the night\r\nAnd now I see the sunrise\r\nNow I feel glorious, glorious\r\nI feel glorious, glorious",
