  "lyrics": "I'm the boy in your other phone\r\nLighting up inside your drawer at home all alone\r\nPushing 40 in the friend zone\r\nWe talk and then you walk away every day\r\nOh, you don't think twice 'bout me\r\nAnd maybe you're right to doubt me, but\n\n\n\nBut if you give me just one night\n\nYou gonna see me in a new light\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nTo meet you underneath the moonlight\n\nOh, I want a take two, I wanna breakthrough\n\nI wanna know the real thing about you\n\nSo I can see you in a new light\n\n\n\nTake a ride up to Malibu\n\nI just wanna stay to look at you, look at you\n\nWhat would it matter if your friends knew?\n\nWho cares what other people say, anyway\n\nOh, we can go far from the end\n\nAnd make a new world together baby\n\n\n\n'Cause if you give me just one night\n\nYou gonna see me in a new light\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nTo meet you underneath the moonlight\n\nOh, I want a take two, I wanna breakthrough\n\nI wanna know the real thing about you\n\nSo I can see you in a new light\n\n\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nYou gonna see me in a new light\n\nYeah, if you give me just one night\n\nTo meet you underneath the moonlight\n\n\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you?\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you?\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this love that's running through my veins for you?\n\nWhat do I do with all this?\n\nWhat do I do with all this?
