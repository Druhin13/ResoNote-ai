  "lyrics": "You knew you were playing with fire\r\nTold you I'd break your heart, I'm no liar\r\nI've never been the type to settle down\r\nMust get that from my Dad, I get around\r\nLately everyone thinks they know me\r\nThat's probably why I've been so lonely\n\nJust broke up with my girl, been holed up from the world\n\nI know that you just want to help, don't plead\n\nBecause, I can't guarantee I won't say something rude\n\nThe pain I been in got me acting brand new\n\nLike new phone, who this?\n\nGive you one shot, don't miss\n\nCause I've got better things to do than play catch up with you\n\n\n\nIt's hard to be the man everyone expects me to be when I'm hurt\n\nYou don't wanna know what I do when I'm alone\n\nLately all I ever really wanna do is work\n\nShow em my worth\n\nLiving with a gift and a curse\n\nI'ma pick a beat up in a hearse\n\nIt is what I do when I don't know what else to do\n\nAnd if you bringing me the drum, I better be rehearsed\n\n\n\nLately, I've been in a little bit of pain, need\n\nSomebody to maybe some and save me\n\nIt's probably what you thinking 'bout me\n\nOh no, no, no, I'm good, you know I'm good\n\nBut lately, I've been in a little bit of pain, need\n\nSomebody to maybe some and save me\n\nIt's probably what you thinking 'bout me\n\nOh no, no, no, I'm good, you know I'm good\n\n\n\nWe knew I'd end up the way I am\n\nNever really been that good of a man\n\nI'm manic and it's hard to settle down\n\nMust get that from my Momma when I'm down\n\nLately I think my brain's on empty\n\nKnow just how to fix it, boy, don't tempt me\n\nI struggle every day, my demons wanna play\n\nI pray that whoever's there won't let me (but hey)\n\nI can't guarantee that I'll never be weak\n\nA role model, I'm sorry that just ain't me\n\nGot new money, new whips\n\nIn the mid-20s, I'm lit\n\nI don't know how to be the man that you want me to be\n\n\n\nAnd maybe I took it too far right there\n\nBut I need you to feel my pain\n\nI been in the game, wearing everybody's energy\n\nThe weight of it killing me and I think I'm 'bout to break\n\nI have been ashamed\n\nPeople have been telling me I'm brave\n\nFor the way that I let him in and say\n\nEven though I really wanna get him\n\nI don't pick another lane, oh man, I don't wanna behave\n\n\n\nLately, I've been in a little bit of pain, need\n\nSomebody to maybe some and save me\n\nIt's probably what you thinking 'bout me\n\nOh no, no, no, I'm good, you know I'm good\n\nBut lately, I've been in a little bit of pain, need\n\nSomebody to maybe some and save me\n\nIt's probably what you thinking 'bout me\n\nOh no, no, no, I'm good, you know I'm good\n\n\n\nYou might be thinking that I have been feeling sorry for myself\n\nBut I'm here to tell you that you've got me mixed up with somebody else\n\nYou know you know it\n\nYou know you know it\n\nWe both know that one day we'll be okay\n\nYou know you know it\n\nYou know you know it\n\nWe both know that one day we'll be okay\n\n\n\nLately, I've been in a little bit of pain, need\n\nSomebody to maybe some and save me\n\nIt's probably what you thinking 'bout me\n\nOh no, no, no, I'm good, you know I'm good\n\nBut lately, I've been in a little bit of pain, need\n\nSomebody to maybe some and save me\n\nIt's probably what you thinking 'bout me\n\nOh no, no, no, I'm good, you know I'm good",
