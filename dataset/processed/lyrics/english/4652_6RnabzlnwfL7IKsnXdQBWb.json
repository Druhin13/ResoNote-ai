What's the feeling?\n\nIf you don't even feel it\n\nThey only get in the way of us\n\n\n\nIf we're in love then we should make it\n\n'Cause when we do is so amazing\n\nShouldn't be a conversation at all\n\nAnd all your friends that's always hating\n\nThey don't know our situation\n\nSo don't discuss these relations of us\n\n\n\nPeople talk, people hear\n\nThey don't know what we deal with\n\nThey only get in the way\n\nThey only get in the way\n\nWhat's the sign?
