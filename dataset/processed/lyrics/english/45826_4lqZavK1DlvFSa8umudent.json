  "lyrics": "Once I lived the life of a millionaire\rSpending my money, I didn't care\rTAkin' my friends out for a mighty good time\rdrinkin' high priced liquor, champagne and wine\rThen I began to fall so low\rcouldn't buy me no friends, have no place to go\rIf I ever get my hands on a dollar again\rI'm gonna hold on to it, till the eagle grins\rI said nobody knows you when you're down and out\rIn your pocket, you ain't got one penny\rAnd your friends, you didn't have any\rJust as soon as you get up on your feet again\rEverybody wants to be your long-lost friend\rOh lord without a doubt\rNobody wants you, nobody needs you nobody wants you\rwhen you're down and out\rI say nobody wants you\rnobody needs you\rnobody wants you when you're down and out",
