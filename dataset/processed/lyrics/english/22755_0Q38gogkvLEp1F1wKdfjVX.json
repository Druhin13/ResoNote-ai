  "lyrics": "Well, I took a stroll on the old long walk\r\nOf a day -I-ay-I-ay\r\nI met a little girl and we stopped to talk\r\nOn a grand soft day -I-ay-I-ay\r\nAnd I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do\r\n'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue\n\nAnd I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl\n\nDown the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl\n\n\n\nWe were halfway there when the rain came down\n\nOn a day -I-ay-I-ay\n\nAnd she took me up to her flat downtown\n\nOn a fine soft day -I-ay-I-ay\n\nAnd I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do\n\nIf her hair was black and her eyes were blue\n\nSo I took her hand and I gave her a twirl\n\nAnd I lost my heart to a Galway girl\n\n\n\nBut when I woke up I was all alone\n\nWith a broken heart and a ticket home\n\nAnd I ask you friend, what's a fella to do\n\nIf her hair was black and her eyes were blue\n\nSee I've traveled around I've been all over the world\n\nI've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl\n\n\n\nAnd I ask you friend, what's a fella to do\n\nIf her hair was black and her eyes were blue\n\nSee I've traveled around I've been all over the world\n\nI've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl",
