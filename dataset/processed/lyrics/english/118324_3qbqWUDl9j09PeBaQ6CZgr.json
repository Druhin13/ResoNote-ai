  "lyrics": "Every time I go closer to the road, leavin' my height\r\nI just want to know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night\r\nIt's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right\r\nI don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride\r\nSittin' in my crib thinkin' 'bout shit\n\nThat I never done, but I wish I did\n\nActin' like I'm fine but I'm losin' it\n\nCoulda kissed that girl, but it ain't relevant\n\nCoulda made that move, I'm regrettin' it\n\nFeelin' so low, like I'm on 2%\n\nBeen livin' love like it's a tournament\n\nLoneliness turned off and now it's on again\n\nTell myself run, ain't no lookin' back\n\nOnly time I do is when I'm reachin' for the stat\n\nBack on my old ways, on my old Mac\n\nThinkin' 'bout my old days, I'll never go back\n\nFuck that, tryna get myself my own crib\n\nBein' independent man, I might just suck my own dick\n\nAin't got time, baby just tryna gold dig\n\nGotta get through all the people that I roll with\n\n\n\nEvery time I go closer to the road, leavin' my height\n\nI just want to know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night\n\nIt's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right\n\nI don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride\n\n\n\nYeah, hole in my soul, don't know how to fill it up\n\nCannot let nobody in, hopin' that they understand\n\nCan't change my ways since I might get through my days\n\nThis just how your boy was raised, vigilant in every way\n\nEvery single night I've been stayin' up\n\nMy imagination's takin' flight and it's takin' off\n\nAnd my time is slowly tickin' now, I don't wanna wait anymore\n\nDon't wanna be erased, wanna make a change\n\n\n\nPlease don't run me, I just lost my way\n\n(my way, my way, my way)\n\nLeave no trace of my misery, get me through the day\n\nGet me through the day (get me through the-)\n\n\n\nEvery time I go closer to the road, leavin' my height\n\nI just want to know why I'm feelin' so lonely at night\n\nIt's my fault, it's my life, I'm so cold, I'm so high, get it right\n\nI don't care, but I fight, we don't lose, we just ride, let it ride",
