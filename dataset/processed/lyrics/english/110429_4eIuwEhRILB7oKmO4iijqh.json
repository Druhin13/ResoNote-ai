(That's right)\nWanna give me your house keys baby, don't ya? (That's right)\n'Cause I be fuckin' ya so goddamn good\nYou'll risk your freedom, move a key for me baby, won't ya (Go get it, you gon' get wit' it)\nGotta be at work at 8 in the mornin'\nYou already know you gon' be late in the mornin'\nI gotta be in another state in the mornin'\nAll I need is eggs n' pancakes in the mornin' (Ha-ha)\nAnd even when ya mad at me I could still get it (Yeah)\n\n'Cause seem like I never come, I just live in it (Yeah)\nThree or fo hours later I am still in it (Yeah)\nAnd when I'm done, ya say it feel like I'm still in it (Yeah)\nIf that thing ain't bald-headed fix that (Oh)\nHere go the razor, I'll see ya when ya get back (Oh)\nWhat ya runnin' fo, calm down sit back\nGot me doin' cardio, I'm workin' on my six pack\n\nI know why you always drippin'\nI must be what you missin'\nI'm comin' through\nI'm touchin' you\nI'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)\nI know why you always drippin'\nI'm comin' through (I am)\n\nI'm touchin' you (And I am)\nI'm up in you tonight (I'm up in you tonight)",
