  "lyrics": "You've been thinking about this all night\r\nAll week saying this was right\r\nCross your heart and hope to die\r\nAre you sure you wanna pay the price?\r\nDo it outside in the night\r\n’Cause where you going is the life\n\n\n\nWhen I'm looking in your face\n\n(Oh, higher, higher)\n\nYou give me faith\n\n(Oh, high up in the sky)\n\nI feel this faith\n\n(Oh, higher, higher)\n\nThis must be fate\n\n(Oh, high up in the sky)\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nSaying that you wanna know\n\nWhat it feels like to let go\n\nEverything that was before\n\nShould you do it in the youth?\n\nBe enlightened, feel the truth\n\nLet the serotonin set you loose\n\n\n\nWhen I'm looking in your face\n\n(Oh, higher, higher)\n\nYou give me faith\n\n(Oh, high up in the sky)\n\nI feel this faith\n\n(Oh, higher, higher)\n\nThis must be fate\n\n(Oh, high up in the sky)\n\nWhat do I know?\n\n\n\nI need somebody, I need a witness\n\nI need somebody, I need a witness\n\nI need somebody, I need a witness\n\nTo look in your eyes when you see the vision\n\nI need somebody, I need a witness\n\nI need somebody, I need a witness\n\nI need somebody, I need a witness\n\nTo look in your eyes when you see the vision\n\nLate night (Late night), decisions (Decisions)\n\nDo you wanna (Do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)\n\nLate night (Late night), decisions (Decisions)\n\nHello (Hello) spirit\n\nBlast off\n\n\n\nHold on tight, hold on for life\n\nIf this is what you like\n\nDo it all night\n\nGirl, I don’t gotta fly\n\nI just wanna ride\n\nBack and forth, left and right\n\nAin't tryna be slick\n\nBut I just wanna slide\n\nOr I can be a kite, and I can just fly\n\nAway with the birds\n\nCall sky\n\nHigh, high, high, high\n\nBackroad trails, follow the line\n\nComing from, still birds in the sky (Oh yeah)\n\nBunch of horses herd in the sky\n\nStare too long, you'll be hurting your eye\n\nHow does it feel to be on this side?\n\nThe sunshine, the all-seeing eye\n\nLike ayy, like a lightning strike\n\nInto your body and up through your mind\n\nAnd into your spirit, and your spirit does glide\n\nFloating high, idling high\n\nAway into the light\n\nHow 'bout we just fly? Here for a dime\n\nAgain\n\n\n\nWhen I'm looking in your face\n\n(Oh, higher, higher)\n\nYou give me faith\n\n(Oh, high up in the sky)\n\nI feel this faith\n\n(Oh, higher, higher)\n\nThis must be fate\n\n(Oh, high up in the sky)\n\nWhat do I know?",
