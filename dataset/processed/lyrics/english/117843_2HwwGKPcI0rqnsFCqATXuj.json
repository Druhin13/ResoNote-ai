  "lyrics": "At the best of times I’m lonely in my mind\r\nBut I can find something to show you\r\nIf you have got the time\r\nWhy would I rely on the things that I did right?\r\nShe said, ‘I gave you four years of my life’\n\nSo, what about these feelings I’ve got?\n\nWe got it wrong and you said you’d had enough\n\nWhat about these feelings I’ve got?\n\nI couldn’t be more in love\n\n\n\nI could have been a great line\n\nI could have been a sign\n\nOr overstay my time\n\nSay what’s on your mind\n\nMaybe I’ll rely on all the things that made it right\n\nBecause I’d give you all the years of my life\n\n\n\nSo, what about these feelings I’ve got?\n\nWe got it wrong and you said you’d had enough\n\nWhat about these feelings I’ve got?\n\nI couldn’t be more in love\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what about these feelings I’ve got?\n\nWe got it wrong and you said you’d had enough\n\nWhat about these feelings I’ve got?\n\nI couldn’t be more in love",
