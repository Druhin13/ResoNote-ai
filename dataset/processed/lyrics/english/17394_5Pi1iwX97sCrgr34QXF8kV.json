  "lyrics": "Cities looking down, bicking it was slim pickings\r\nHit Whole Foods, thereâ€™s no more Kobe\r\nSo I moved to LA and there's no more Kobe\r\nGuess I'm too late\r\nYo it's like a Gucci belt\r\nYour coochie felt tight around my waist\n\nFeel my pain like it was tatted on your face\n\nThis shit hot like, how you get when we embrace\n\n\n\nThis the prequel to the se-e-equal\n\nIll shit to let you know the illest shit is coming\n\nTry to bag her, but the lil stupid bitch be bugging\n\nStraight fronting, like rented ass drop-tops\n\nOr not answering collect when your mans get knocked\n\nPeace to *beep* I know you locked in your box\n\nIncarcerate your body but they can't tame your thoughts\n\nReal nigga, thank his moms on the intro\n\nWe talk here and there, but your blessings was super beneficial\n\nI hit your lines if it's a issue\n\n'Member how they used to diss you\n\nHow your eyebrows was flawed\n\nNow they all love us yeah, but I know when they frauds\n\nKeep my kinship with God, splinting\n\nImage of Christ in these fresh ass Nikes\n\nDon't front this shit is tight\n\nI'm a Brooklynite, skin color of a Brooklyn night",
