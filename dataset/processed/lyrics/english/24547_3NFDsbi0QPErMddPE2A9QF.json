  "lyrics": "How to see if the sun go down\r\nIs a heart made of gold?\r\nFrom the land, little children watch it burn\r\nFortune favors the cold\r\nPeople tell me \"boy, you got lucky!\"\n\nBut I feel about as lucky as a snowman in the spring\n\n\n\nMind over matter, head over heart\n\nLove's a terrible thing\n\n\n\nPeople tell me \"boy, you dodged a bullet!\"\n\nBut if only it had hit me, then I'd know the peace it brings\n\n\n\nIt's just mind over matter, head over heart\n\nLove's a terrible thing\n\n\n\nOut on the water, hear the angels sing\n\n\"Love's a terrible thing!\"",
