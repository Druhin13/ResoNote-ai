They'll put me straight to sleep\r\nSayin' all you state is facts, when all them links make believe\r\nHe can fake it like he wit' it, but I know he ain't a beast\r\nRIP L'A Capone, me and mines just play for keeps\n\nYou don't got no hustle, you be breakin' every lease\n\nRemember they ain't give me time, but now they wanna marry me\n\nWhen you feel death around the corner, nigga that's a scary thing\n\nThese blue birds in my jeans, talk like a parakeet\n\nI got my own style bitch, stop comparin' me\n\nAin't gettin' money stop the purpin', put his face wit' charity\n\nNigga 'less yo' name God bitch it ain't no scarin' me\n\nAnd I just bought another chop, this bitch Mariah Carey sing\n\nI know you don't mean it when you said you care for me\n\nGive up on me? Don't you do that bitch, shout out to Derrick King\n\nSaid she love me very much, told that bitch I'm very sleep\n\nTold my girl that I'm 200 she was like, \"you better be\"\n\nSoon as my higari broke, that's when they wanna spread the peace\n\nCame to the conclusion I want war and that's 'til I rest wit' T\n\nDamn Tre why it had to be you?\n\nI got the news, couldn't believe, it was sad to be true\n\nBitch I'm always on my game, I brought a strap in the booth\n\nBut when they ask for my government, I'm like you askin' for who?\n\nAnd me and Brodie off a four, and we just matchin' a deuce\n\nAnd that's hi-tech, now I got green day, I might crash in the coupe\n\nEverybody rap 'bout guns, what can they actually prove?\n\nBefore I rocked them foreign kicks, I had Shaq on the shoes\n\nHa yeah, I'm thankful for the struggle\n\nReal chip getter, I'm just thankful for the ruffles\n\nSlippin' wit' the bitch, then we aimin' at the couple\n\nFour on my bodyguard, nigga I don't ever rumble\n\nYeah, bitch we don't ever chunk 'em\n\nMust I say again? Pussy we don't ever tussle\n\nNever had a pop, so I lent 'em to the uncle\n\nSurvival of the fittest, I'm just thuggin' in the jungle\n\nBitch, and you be thuggin' wit' your feelin's\n\nKnock my bitch, yo' bitch too, fuck it call up Jerry Springer\n\nFollow every step I take, they just followin' the leader\n\nIf you run up on me wrong, then you followin' the heater\n\nFake ass thug, you be borrowin' the heater\n\nBrodie all about the bitch, we just borrowin' her Visa\n\nNigga what? Who is you to tell me what the fuck I need to do?\n\nNiggas hidin', choppa find 'em, lil' nigga peek a boo\n\nAnd you won't see a eyebrow when we creepin' through\n\nI don't gotta lie to sell nigga I can speak the truth\n\nNigga if you ain't thuggin' then my music may not speak to you\n\nTryna keep up where you can't compete, you niggas need a boost\n\nBitch, I'm that nigga for real\n\nThey hear my shit and take down notes it's like I'm givin' them skills\n\nNigga you ain't never been on no mission to kill\n\nAnd every verse a nigga spit, I be givin' 'em chills\n\nOn the gang\n\n\n\nYeah, givin' em chills\n\nGivin' em chills\n\nAh, show 'em how we feel",
