  "lyrics": "(by Allman Brothers Band)\r\nWell, I've got to run to keep from hiding\r\nAnd I'm bound to keep on riding\r\nAnd I've got one more silver dollar\r\nBut I'm not gonna let them catch me, no\n\nNot gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider\n\n\n\nAnd I don't own the clothes I'm wearing\n\nAnd the road goes on forever\n\nAnd I've got one more silver dollar\n\nBut I'm not gonna let them catch me, no\n\nNot gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider\n\n\n\nAnd I've gone by the point of caring\n\nSome old bed I'll soon be sharing\n\nAnd I've got one more silver dollar\n\n\n\n(Repeat three times and Fade)\n\nBut I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no\n\nNot gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider",
