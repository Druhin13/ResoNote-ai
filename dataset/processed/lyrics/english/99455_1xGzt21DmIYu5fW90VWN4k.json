  "lyrics": "Karma\r\nSneakin' up behind you like a thief in the night\r\nSometimes you can't put up a fight\r\nWatchin' what you doin' today\r\nIt might come back to you where ever you lay\r\nIt comes back in many forms\n\nKnockin' on your door\n\nAnswer to see what's in store\n\nKeep the darkness out\n\nBring the light in\n\nKarma is what we call it\n\nIt may or may not be afraid\n\nYour faith can be left in the hands of God or the devil\n\nSpeak life into positive energy\n\nPray off negativity\n\nPractice what you preach\n\nWhile your still prayin' for your enemies\n\nIt'll all come back to you\n\nDirectin' your own journey\n\nFallin' and gettin' back up again\n\nLovin' yourself and others around you\n\nYour existence is challenged by karma\n\nChoose wisely",
