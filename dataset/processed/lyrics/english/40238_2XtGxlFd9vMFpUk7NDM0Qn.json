  "lyrics": "Dolorous\nLifeless in her gaze\nBlank reflection a memory merged with the haze\nRabid, in fervor\nYou brought it here\nFrom deep pits of woe and dismay\n\nFrom the chasm that opens in us\n\nIn the festering wound where death holds sway\n\n\n\nDeep down black rivers flow\n\nFissures in the stone\n\nDown below\n\nDown there the tide is slow\n\nIn eternities alone\n\nDown below\n\n\n\nIt brought us here to this shadowy place\n\nWhere there's naught to do pray\n\nOut of time's the time\n\nFallen from grace\n\nThe bells chime\n\nTo carry my curse away\n\n\n\nDeep down black rivers flow\n\nFissures in the stone\n\nDown below\n\nDown there the tide is slow\n\nIn eternities alone\n\nDown below",
