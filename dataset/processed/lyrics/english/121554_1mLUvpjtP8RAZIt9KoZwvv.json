  "lyrics": "How do you love someone, that's hurt so bad?\r\nEven 911, ain't got a thing, to help them\r\nHow do you mend a wound that cuts straight through their heart?\r\nAnd you can see that everything that's left, just ain't enough\r\nI know we did some damage (I know)\n\nNobody else understands it (No, no)\n\nWell baby, here's my shoulder you can lean on\n\nAnd it's 24/7 (I know)\n\nWhenever you need a friend, yeah (No, no)\n\nI wait on standby and I won't ever leave\n\n\n\nIn case of emergency\n\nEmergency, emergency\n\nIn case of emergency\n\n\n\nHow do you love someone who sees the past?\n\nBut can't seem to change or keep repeating mistakes from wayback\n\nHow do you love someone, who sees the bad in everything?\n\nDrinking from a half-empty glass, thinking suicidal\n\nOnly ones we hurt are ourselves and I don't know why\n\n\n\nI know we did some damage (I know)\n\nNobody else understands it (No, no)\n\nWell baby, here's my shoulder you can lean on (You can lean on me)\n\nAnd it's 24/7 (I know)\n\nWhenever you need a friend, yeah (Whenever, baby)\n\nI wait on standby and I won't ever leave\n\n\n\nIn case of emergency\n\nEmergency, emergency\n\nI'll be right there, in case of emergency\n\n\n\nI wouldn't leave you in darkness\n\nWeren't I always here when you needed me the most?\n\nI will walk with you through all your flames\n\nStep away from borderline, you know what's done is done\n\nYou don't need to worry, oh\n\n\n\nIn case of emergency\n\nIn case of emergency, yeah (You know I)\n\nEmergency, emergency (Baby, yeah yeah)\n\nIn case of emergency, in case of emergency",
