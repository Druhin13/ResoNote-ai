  "lyrics": "You say that you're leaving\r\nBut I don't think I can let go\r\nWhen you put the phone down\r\nI began to cry\r\nWhat are you to do\r\nWhen the person that you love just says no?\n\nBoy, get yourself together\n\nMove on with your life\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm\n\nGot to get you out my system\n\nI would do anything to keep you off my mind\n\nI'm gonna have to call my sisters\n\nBe around the ones who listen\n\nAnything to drown you out tonight\n\n\n\nBaby\n\nYou make me crazy\n\nWhy'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?\n\nSave me\n\nMake it all hazy\n\nSo I don't think about you 혩til tomorrow\n\n\n\nIt wasn't enough\n\nBut you could've had the guts to face me\n\nIt would have meant so much\n\nIf you'd looked me in the eye\n\nWhy do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?\n\nI must see some kind of beauty in their eyes\n\n\n\nSo I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm\n\nGot to get you out my system\n\nI would do anything to keep you off my mind\n\nI'm gonna have to call my sisters\n\nBe around the ones who listen\n\nAnything to drown you out tonight\n\n\n\nBaby\n\nYou make me crazy\n\nWhy'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?\n\nSave me\n\nMake it all hazy\n\nSo I don't think about you 혩til tomorrow\n\n\n\nBaby\n\nYou make me crazy\n\nWhy'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?\n\nSave me\n\nMake it all hazy\n\nSo I don't think about you 혩til tomorrow\n\n\n\nBaby\n\nYou make me crazy\n\nWhy'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?\n\nSave me\n\nMake it all hazy\n\nSo I don't think about you 혩til tomorrow",
