  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Sincerity Is Scary par The 1975\r\nAnd irony is okay, I suppose, culture is to blame\nYou try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way\nYou lack substance when you say\nSomething like, \"Oh, what a shame\"\nIt's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human\nI'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon\nAnd start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming\n\nI'm sure that you're not just another girl\nI'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist\nI feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for\n\n\nWhy can't we be friends, when we are lovers?\n'Cause it always ends with us hating each other\nInstead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in\nI've just got one more thing to say\n\nAnd why would you believe\nYou could control how you're perceived\nWhen at your best you're intermediately\nVersed in your own feelings?\nKeep on putting off conceiving\nIt's only you that you're deceiving\nOh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it\n\nWhy can't we be friends, when we are lovers?\n'Cause it always ends with us hating each other\n\nInstead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in\nI've just got one more thing to say\n\nI'm just pissed off because you pied me off\nAfter your show when you let go of my hand\nIn front of some sket who wanted to bitch",
