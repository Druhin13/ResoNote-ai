  "lyrics": "All I ever wanted was to find you\r\nFind a love I never know\r\nI can feel the pain inside me fading\r\nWhile I’m fading into you\r\n\nI’ve been in Paris, been in Rome\n\nBut I’ve never found my home\n\nTill you came and took my hand\n\nBeen to desert and a coast\n\nCouple turns along the road\n\nThen I’ve found you in the end\n\n\n\nYou lead the way out of the dark\n\nPlaying out my cards\n\nIn the end I love them showing hearts\n\nSeasons changing all the time\n\nBut our love is one of a kind\n\nWrite our names into the sky\n\n\n\nCome on, keep it going\n\nThere’s so much for us to see\n\nIt don’t matter where we are\n\nAs long as you’re with me\n\n\n\nAll I ever wanted was to find you\n\nFind a love I never know\n\nI can feel the pain inside me fading\n\nWhile I’m fading into you\n\n\n\nCity lights passing by\n\nWithout you I’m color-blind\n\nAin’t no reason left to hide\n\nChasing highs day and night\n\nPraying you stay by my side\n\nWhen you’re with me, I’m alright\n\n\n\nYou lead the way out of the dark\n\nPlaying out my cards\n\nIn the end I love them showing hearts\n\nNever leave, standing still\n\nPut you on a pedestal\n\nKeep you safe and always well\n\n\n\nCome on, keep it going\n\nThere’s so much for us to see\n\nIt don’t matter where we are\n\nAs long as you’re with me\n\n\n\nAll I ever wanted was to find you\n\nFind a love I never know\n\nI can feel the pain inside me fading\n\nWhile I’m fading into you",
