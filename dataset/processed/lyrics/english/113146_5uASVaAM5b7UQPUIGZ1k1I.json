  "lyrics": "So soon,\r\nJust after you've gone\r\nMy senses sharpen\r\nBut it always takes\r\nSo damned long\r\nBefore I feel how much \n\nMy eyes have darkened\n\n\n\nFear hangs a plane of gunsmoke\n\nDrifting in our room\n\nSo easy to disturb\n\nWith a thought\n\nWith a whisper...\n\nWith a careless memory\n\n\n\nOn the table\n\nSigns of love life scattered...\n\nAnd the walls break\n\nWe go crashing within\n\nIt's not as though--\n\nAs though you really mattered\n\nBut being close,\n\nHow could I let you go\n\nWithout some feeling\n\nSome precious sympathy following\n\n\n\nFear hangs a plane of gunsmoke\n\nDrifting in our room\n\nSo easy to disturb\n\nWith a thought\n\nWith a whisper...\n\nWith a careless memory\n\n\n\nI walk out into the sun\n\nI try to find a new day\n\nBut the whole place\n\nIt just screams in my eyes\n\nWhere are you now?\n\nCuz I don't want to meet you\n\nI think I'd die--\n\nI think I'd laugh at you--\n\nI think I'd cry--\n\nWhat am I supposed to do,\n\nFollow you?\n\n\n\nOutside the thoughts \n\nCome flooding back now...\n\nI just try to forget you...\n\nSo easy to disturb\n\nWith a thought...\n\nWith a whisper...\n\nWith a careless memory...",
