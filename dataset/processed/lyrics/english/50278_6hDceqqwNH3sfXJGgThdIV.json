  "lyrics": "You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars\r\nNever leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark\r\nYou don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same\r\nYeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change\r\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\nYeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling\n\nMaybe something new is what you're needing\n\nLike a real life, let your hair down, feel alive\n\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\n\n\nSay you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud\n\nNever had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up\n\nWell, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove\n\nBut give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you\n\n\n\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\nYeah, let yourself go, follow that feeling\n\nMaybe something new is what you're needing\n\nLike a real life, let your hair down, feel alive\n\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\n\n\nNow the way you're looking says you're living\n\nI hope I ain't reading wrong\n\nCause the way you're shining I think you're thinking\n\nIt's been way too long\n\n\n\nWhen was the last time you did something for the first time?\n\nYeah yeah, let yourself go, come on follow that feeling\n\nMaybe something new is what you're needing\n\nLike a real life, let your hair down, feel alive, alive\n\nWhen was the last time oh you did something for the first time, girl?\n\nCome on, baby\n\nWhen was the last time yeah you did something for the first time?",
