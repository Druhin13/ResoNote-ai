  "lyrics": "God says it takes far more than confession\r\nBe a good man or give me your best impression\r\nGod says my bloods too warm for forgiveness\r\nSet forth on the interstellar ark of sinners\r\nGod's face was so big on that day\n\nLord don't let me get bored Sunday\n\nLeft with a million things to say\n\nLeft me on this doomsday\n\n\n\nGod said the confusion is the feeling\n\nWrite a hook here or let it be unappealing\n\nGod said read me in the cliff's erosion\n\nSunlight feels so good but I just can't see nothing\n\n\n\nGod's face was so big on that day\n\nLord don't let me get bored Sunday\n\nLeft with a million things to say\n\nLeft me on this doomsday",
