  "lyrics": "Was it you or was it me?\r\nIs this a nightmare or just a dream?\r\nI've lost my mind, I've lost myself\r\nAm I at home or am I in hell?\r\nI'm in my room\r\nThey're by my side\n\nMy little monsters, they try to hide\n\nI've tried to run, they're close behind\n\nI cry for help but no one's in sight\n\n\n\nBut now I'm home\n\nRight where I belong\n\nAnd I cannot stay strong\n\nAnd in my mind\n\nIt's what I deserved all along\n\nJust let me go\n\nI'm trapped within my home\n\nThey left me all alone\n\nIt's all I know\n\nAnd as my fear grows\n\nIt's where I call my home\n\n\n\nThey're in my room\n\nThey're in the halls and underneath my bed\n\nThey say I'm sick\n\nWell maybe I'm just better off dead\n\nTheir wicked words, they cut my nerves\n\nAnd make me feel like I'm nothing\n\n\n\nThey say get closer but I'm scared\n\nThey put me down, no this isn't fair\n\nThey mock my name\n\nPut me to shame\n\nSo like balloons, I'll float away\n\n\n\nBut now I'm home\n\nRight where I belong\n\nAnd I cannot stay strong\n\nAnd in my mind\n\nIt's what I deserved all along\n\nJust let me go\n\nI'm trapped within my home\n\nThey left me all alone\n\nIt's all I know\n\nAnd as my fear grows\n\nIt's where I call my home\n\n\n\n(Just let me go)\n\n(It's where I call my home)\n\n(Just let me go)\n\n\n\nCan you even hear me cry?\n\nI know you're broken deep inside\n\nI swear I'll put you back together\n\n\n\nBut now I'm home\n\nRight where I belong\n\nAnd I cannot stay strong\n\nAnd in my mind\n\nIt's what I deserved all along\n\nJust let me go\n\nI'm trapped within my home\n\nThey left me all alone\n\nIt's all I know\n\nAnd as my fear grows\n\nIt's where I call my home",
