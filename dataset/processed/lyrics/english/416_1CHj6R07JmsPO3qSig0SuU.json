  "lyrics": "Remember that time that I made you so mad\r\nLast week right ha ha you know that\r\nIt's not like it's all that rare\r\nSo put it here and let me cherish the embarrassment\r\nI realize I've been a dick head yes\r\nAnd I respect how you question your investments\n\nI take the plane but it ain't to be impressive\n\nIt feels like a cop out to label it lessons\n\nI've been though the rain but I've put other people through a hurricane just to work the game\n\nSome time I swim through so much shame\n\nI think my little man's blessed that he didn't get my last name\n\nAnd here you are right in front of me offering it all like tell me what you want from me\n\nI wanna love you today and forever\n\nLet me clear my through and rub my wings together\n\n\n\nIt goes: I'm not perfect but I'm this that and this\n\nMy hands are dirty and I'm this that and this\n\nYou've been searching for this that and this\n\nLet's break the surface and make a little happy mess\n\n[x2]\n\n\n\nWhoo girl, you're the most beautiful thing I've seen\n\nEnticing, exciting\n\nEven the sound of your voice gotta nice ring\n\nYa seem like the type that might help me tighten up my pipe dreams\n\nWe can keep digging through this dirt\n\nTeam up, you and I against the universe\n\nThink about it, What cha say to your self\n\nYou can wear my cape and I can play with your belt\n\nThe truth is there now\n\nStand with me, look into that mirror now\n\nAnd tell me you don't see the same image\n\nGonna be a brand name babe once the rain is finished\n\n\n\nIt goes: I'm not perfect but I'm this that and this\n\nMy hands are dirty and I'm this that and this\n\nYou've been searching for this that and this\n\nLet's break the surface and make a little happy mess\n\n[x2]\n\n\n\nI can't believe she got me on a ball and chain\n\nIt's not a complaint, I appreciate it\n\nFor all the dumb mistakes I make I'm surprised baby girl ain't threw me away\n\nI never meant to hurt no one, I just want to stay productive till the work is done\n\nI dance to a sertain drum, but when I fell off beat you didn't turn and run, no\n\nYou see me at my lowest low\n\nYou gave me sight when I had broken focus\n\nWith a smile that opens up like a rose bud\n\nEven when it all seemed so fucking hopeless\n\nAnd here you are right in front of me\n\nOffering it all like tell me what you want from me\n\nI want to thank you today and forever\n\nLet's make a little happy mess together\n\nYou know\n\n\n\nIt goes: I'm not perfect but I'm this that and this\n\nMy hands are dirty and I'm this that and this\n\nYou've been searching for this that and this\n\nLet's break the surface and make a little happy mess\n\n[x2]",
