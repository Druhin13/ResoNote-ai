  "lyrics": "Once upon a time as in Ancient history\r\nHigh upon a hill in a shroud Of mystery\r\nLoomed the abbey as we Journeyed through the night\r\nAnd wended our way Towards the light\r\nAs we entered through the Gates\n\nWe heard the silent calls\n\nThere was something evil\n\nThat lurked within these Walls\n\nAs I relive my days in this Godforsaken place\n\nAll that appears before me Now...is her face\n\n\n\nAnother man died today like The ones before\n\nWith blackened tongue and Blackened finger\n\nWithin the labyrinth behind The bolted door\n\nLies the answer to our Mystery\n\n\n\nHeed the book that kills -\n\nIt holds an evil power\n\nThose who turn the leaves Wither like a flower\n\nWell guarded by the seer Inside the abbey tower\n\nFor laughter kills the fear Within\n\nThe abbey of synn\n\n\n\nWe found the secret path That led us here to you\n\nGive us the deadly book of Laughter\n\nToo many men have died for A teaching of the few\n\nOpen up your heart reveal The mystery\n\n\n\nHeed the book that kills -\n\nIt holds an evil power\n\nThose who turn the leaves Wither like a flower\n\nWell guarded by the seer Inside the abbey tower\n\nFor laughter kills the fear Within\n\nThe abbey of synn\n\n\n\nAnd then she came 2 me Like a creature from the Dawn\n\nEnchanting as the moon - Radiant as the sun\n\nShe took the boy in me and Gave me back the man\n\nWith a force I could not Withstand\n\n\n\nThe seer burned the abbey Down and perished in the fire\n\nWe couldn't save the book The flames were rising Higher\n\nSo many died in vain for an Ancient discipline\n\nLaughter kills the fear within The abbey of synn\n\n\n\nHeed the book that kills -\n\nIt holds an evil power\n\nThose who turn the leaves Wither like a flower\n\nWell guarded by the seer Inside the abbey tower\n\nFor laughter kills the fear Within\n\nThe abbey of synn",
