  "lyrics": "Excuse me while I kiss the sky\r\nSing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies\r\nThinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise\r\nTell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes\r\nWatching as I say this and then I do that\r\nTelling them the old words but in a new rap\n\nThen I change my mind up and make them lose track\n\nShit I'm inconsistent I thought you knew that\n\n\n\nMaybe I should be more grateful\n\nThat I had to watch it all come undone\n\nHolding so tight to the edge is painful\n\nBut I can't ignore it I know\n\n\n\nThey're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go\n\nI gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so\n\nThey're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below\n\nBut maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't \n\nTo get some-\n\n\n\nExcuse me while I sympathize\n\nSinging with the fat lady tell me what's the time\n\nYou know what it is not afraid to cross the line\n\nNothing is forever don't be mad at the design\n\nAsk me if I can, I say I don't know\n\nAnd honestly I buy that I can sound cold\n\nStill upset from shit that's 15 years old\n\nI don't know what it takes to make me let go\n\n\n\nMaybe I should be more grateful\n\nThat I had to watch it all come undone\n\nHolding so tight to the edge is painful\n\nBut I can't ignore it I know\n\n\n\nThey're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go\n\nI gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so\n\nThey're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below\n\nBut maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't \n\nTo get somewhere they won't\n\n\n\nThey're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go\n\nI gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so\n\nThey're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below\n\nBut maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't\n\nTo get somewhere they won't\n\nTo get somewhere they won't\n\nTo get somewhere they won't",
