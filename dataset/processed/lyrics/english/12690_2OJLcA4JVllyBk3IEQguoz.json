  "lyrics": "Oh, you almost got me\r\nYes I was starting to dum\r\nOh, then remembered that my own mind was my greatest contender\r\nSo you can give me all you got\r\nCan throw it all at me\n\nNever, ever, ever gonna stop till I'm free\n\nYou can give me all you got\n\nCan throw it all at me\n\nNever, ever, ever gonna stop till I'm free\n\n\n\nI'm sticking to my guns\n\nTill my work is done\n\nI'm sticking to my guns\n\nTill my work is done\n\n\n\nDon't, as I lay me down\n\nI only hope that I'll still be around\n\nOh, I got so much more to do\n\nI pray I'm here to see it through\n\n\n\nSo you can give me all you got\n\nCan throw it all at me\n\nNever, ever, ever gonna stop till I'm free\n\nYou can give me all you got\n\nCan throw it all at me\n\nNever, ever, ever gonna stop till I'm free\n\n\n\nI'm sticking to my guns\n\nTill my work is done\n\nI'm sticking to my guns\n\nTill my work is done\n\n\n\nI'm sticking to my guns\n\nTill my work is done\n\nI'm sticking to my guns\n\nTill my work is done\n\n\n\n(Chris, why don't you play it for me here)\n\n\n\nSticking to my guns\n\nSticking to my guns\n\nSticking to my guns\n\nSticking to my guns\n\n\n\nAnd religion is such a sensitive subject you know\n\nI mean, people are passionate about what they believe, ehm you know\n\nBut I've heard God get blamed for a lot of things that I think he got nothing to do with, ehm you know\n\nThe president we just voted in, many evangelicals thought he was the most qualified candidate that represented them the best, you know\n\nRegardless of all the hateful things he spoke\n\n9/11 was in the name of God, killing people in the name of God\n\nYou know, I just think sometimes humanity sneaks in and God has nothing to do with what we're doing",
