  "lyrics": "I think I'm fearful of things like traveling\r\nI'm fearful of failure\r\nI'm fearful of being embarrassed, things like that I think hinder me from doing the best that I can sometimes\r\nBut I think that if I learn to be less fearful\r\nI would get further\r\nI feel like I'm not always\n\nIn the correct direction, even though I know I'm on the right path\n\nI'm like \"I'm on the right path\"\n\nBut am I walking the right way or should I be turning around?\n\nLike little things like that that I go back and forth about in my head\n\nAnd I think it's always nice to have reassurance\n\nI think it's really nice to see how far being a genuine person can get you\n\nFor me at least, like I think that's the reason that I am where I am\n\nI think that I am a big mix of all the people around me\n\nAnd I'm just happy\n\nI can't complain about anything\n\nOh yeah\n\nThat I'm trying to get so motherfucking high, nigga\n\nI don't wanna feel nothing (Wait, what?)",
