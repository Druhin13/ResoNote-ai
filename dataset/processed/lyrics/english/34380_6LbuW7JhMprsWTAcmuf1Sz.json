  "lyrics": "I'm on a one-way road to my home on high\r\nLord, when I die, I'll be heaven-bound\r\nMourn not to see me go down that holy road\r\nFor when I'm gone, I'll make my peace be known\r\nI see your crying eyes turn to diamond skies\n\nAs my soul takes flight from my darkened mind\n\nAnd you'll know that the day has come when this life has run\n\nAnd a fading sun shines the way back home\n\n\n\nAs my life changes states, unbound by time and space\n\nYou will fill this place and see me go\n\nAnd we will gather again in the mountains\n\nWith family and friends on another plane",
