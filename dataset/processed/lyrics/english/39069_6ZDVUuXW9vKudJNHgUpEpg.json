  "lyrics": "All your secrets\r\nCan you keep them?\r\nIt's the poison that youâ€™re holding inside\r\nWill you reach out for the cure and face the fight?\r\nAll your demons\n\nDo you fear them?\n\nAs you scream into the pillow at night\n\nWill you reach out for the cure and face the fight?\n\n\n\nI am your voice when you are silenced\n\nI am your hope when you believe\n\nI am the wind that lifts you up again\n\nI am the knife that sets you free\n\nI am the knife that sets you free\n\n\n\nAre you broken?\n\nInto pieces?\n\nDo you hold yourself together too tight?\n\nWill you reach out for the cure and face the light?\n\n\n\nWhen you see your world in black & white\n\nAnd when the sun don't seem to shine so bright\n\nWill you reach out for the cure and win the fight?\n\n\n\nI am your voice when you are silenced\n\nI am your hope when you believe\n\nI am the wind that lifts you up again\n\nI am the knife that sets you free\n\nI am the knife that sets you free\n\n\n\nI hold you close\n\nWon't let you go\n\nI know your heart is aching\n\n\n\nI hold you close\n\nWon't let you go\n\nI know your heart...\n\n\n\nI hold you close\n\nWon't let you go\n\nI know your heart is aching\n\n\n\nI am your voice when you are silent\n\nI am the wind that lifts you up again\n\nI am the knife that sets you free\n\nI am your hope when you believe",
