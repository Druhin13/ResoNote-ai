When I was young, I used to ask hella questions\n\nAlways listened to my OG’s, they taught me life lessons\n\nDo unto others as they do unto you\n\nThat’s what they told your little nephew\n\n‘Cause karma’ll come back and haunt you\n\nA hitta come out the blue outta nowhere, you’re dead\n\nFonkin’ with too many niggas that put some bread on your head\n\nAll you got is your word and your name, respect it and honor it\n\nProtect it, my nigga, don’t let no bitch nigga tarnish it\n\nWe in a Thunderbird, listen to Parliament\n\nLemon tree ain’t shit, taste retarded\n\nI don’t talk it, I beez a part of it\n\nTrappin’ in the hood, nigga, right in the heart of it\n\nIf consequences make your decision\n\nYou end up dead, or off in prison\n\nI walk it, man, but they don’t listen\n\nLessons in life, playing my position\n\n\n\nLivin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’\n\nRunnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection\n\nMy nigga just beat his case, they be testin’\n\nReally outside, nigga…life lessons\n\nLivin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’\n\nRunnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection\n\nMy nigga just beat his case, they be testin’\n\nReally outside, nigga…life lessons",
