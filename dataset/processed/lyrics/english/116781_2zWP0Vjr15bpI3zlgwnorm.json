  "lyrics": "I think I saw you in my sleep, darling,\r\nI think I saw you in my dreams you were\r\nStitching up the seams on every broken promise\r\nThat your body couldn't keep.\r\nI think I saw you in my sleep.\n\nI thought I heard the door open, oh no,\n\nI thought I heard the door open but\n\nI only heard it close.\n\n\n\nI thought I heard a plane crashing, but\n\nNow I think it was your passion snapping.\n\n\n\nI think you saw me confronting my fear, it\n\nWent up with a bottle and went down with the beer and\n\nI think you ought to stay away from here\n\nThere are ghosts in the walls and they\n\nCrawl in your head through your ear.\n\n\n\nI think I saw you in my sleep, lover,\n\nI think I saw you in my dreams you were\n\nStitching up the seams on every mangled promise\n\nThat your body couldn't keep.\n\nI think I saw you in my sleep",
