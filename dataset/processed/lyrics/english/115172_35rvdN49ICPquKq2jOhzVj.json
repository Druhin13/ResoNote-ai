  "lyrics": "I saw a photograph from ten years back\r\nIt's you and I, we're standin' in the rain\r\nSomewhere outside Atlanta, and I think my twelve-seat van\r\nIs right there out of frame\r\nThis was before I knew my way around Los Angeles\n\nBefore I ever cared about nice neighborhoods\n\nWe were drivin' through the night, sleepin' on hotel floors\n\nAnd thinkin' that we had it good\n\n\n\nWe were kids back then, thinkin' we could live forever\n\nWe were kids back then (you and me)\n\nWe were wild and free, takin' all the world together\n\nWe were kids back then\n\nThat's how we're always gonna be\n\n\n\nPassed an old friend on my timeline who had lately been on my mind\n\nWe were close as blood\n\nIf we sat down for a drink I think we'd forget all the stupid reasons\n\nWe lost touch (we lost touch)\n\nIt was just because\n\n\n\nWe were kids back then, thinkin' we could live forever\n\nWe were kids back then, you and me\n\nWe were wild and free, takin' all the world together\n\nWe were kids back then\n\nThat's how we're always gonna be\n\n\n\nAll you got to do is blink your eyes and the years go by like that\n\nThey fly right past\n\nI don't want to wait to realize everything that you and I\n\nAlready have\n\n\n\nFive-thirty in the mornin', and we're awake again\n\nYou are holdin' baby Jane\n\nI lean in to take a picture, when it hits me\n\nIn twenty years, I will look back and say\n\n\n\nWe were kids back then, thinkin' we would live forever\n\nWe were kids back then\n\nWe're so young and free, takin' all the world together\n\nWe were kids back then\n\nThat's how we're always gonna be\n\n\n\nWe were kids back then, thinkin' we could live forever\n\nWe were kids back then, you and me\n\nWe were wild and free, takin' all the world together\n\nWe were kids back then\n\nThat's how we're always gonna be\n\nThat's how we're always gonna be\n\nOh, that's how we're always gonna be",
