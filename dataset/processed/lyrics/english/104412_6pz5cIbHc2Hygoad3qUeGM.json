  "lyrics": "Lie awake in a dream, drag me far away\r\nYour eyes they come to life as you feed off the weak\r\nStrength in the numbers\r\nIt’s all they see of you, nothing more\r\nMaterialistic minds\n\nTell me do you feel alive?\n\nYou’re searching for yourself\n\nIn a strangers eyes\n\nLiving in a world that vanity buys\n\nHumanity has crossed the line\n\n\n\nThis is how it ends\n\nWeakness in me\n\nI wear on my sleeve\n\nOffer your true light to the world\n\nWeakness in you\n\nA taste of the truth\n\nThis mask you wear will slip away\n\nAnd all will become clear\n\n\n\nTurn away from the screens\n\nTell me how does it feel\n\nDepression comes in waves\n\nWhen things start to feel real\n\n\n\nI’m holding on to the hope that we can change our ways\n\nMaterialistic minds\n\nTell me do you feel alive?\n\n\n\nA withering sense of self became my home\n\nNow I’m living with the enemy\n\n\n\nWe will not walk, we will not crawl\n\nIn a world of empty souls\n\nIs this the means to an end?\n\nAnnihilation",
