  "lyrics": "Lord, what were You saying?\r\nI must've fallen asleep\r\nCould've sworn I heard You talking\r\nOr maybe it was just a dream\r\nIt sounded something like redemption\r\nAn echo from a younger day\n\nLord, how long have I been drifting?\n\nMy tears are falling as I pray\n\n\n\nLord, wake up this sleeper\n\nI lift my head, I lift my head\n\nYour searchlights found me\n\nHere at my end, I'm at my end\n\n\n\nIs it the fear of falling down again?\n\nOh, that keeps me sitting here\n\nI'd rather wander in the shadows\n\nThan have to look into the mirror\n\nThere's so much madness all around me\n\nThey wear their darkness on their sleeves\n\nNow my blinded eyes are open\n\nAnd I see the darkest part of me\n\n\n\nLord, wake up this sleeper\n\nI lift my head, I lift my head\n\nYour searchlights found me\n\nHere at my end, I'm at my end\n\n\n\nLord, let Your fire make holy these lips unclean\n\nShine down in all Your glory\n\nAwaken me\n\nLord, let Your fire make holy these lips unclean\n\nShine down in all Your glory\n\nAwaken me\n\n\n\nLord, wake up this sleeper\n\nLord, let Your fire make holy these lips unclean\n\nYour searchlights found me\n\nShine down in all your glory\n\nAwaken me, oh\n\n\n\nLord, let Your fire make holy these lips unclean\n\nShine down in all your glory\n\nAwaken me",
