  "lyrics": "In and out, counting hours, rocketing around\r\nHolding on, ten thousand miles, and never touch the ground\r\nDifferent sheets on the same old me\r\nGotta wake up, don't let down (down, down)\r\nYou gotta wake up, donâ€™t let down\n\nThen you put it on the paper here before me\n\nNodding my head when I really mean maybe\n\nJust wanna sit at home and watch a little TV\n\nFocus on the thunder in my head\n\n\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\n\n\nNear and far, been sharing cars with dreamers just like me\n\nOn lily pads, hope it lasts before I sink too deep\n\nI miss my bed and hiding in it (in it)\n\nI miss that simple way of living (living)\n\n\n\nThen you put it on the paper here before me\n\nNodding my head when I really mean maybe\n\nJust wanna sit at home and watch a little TV\n\nFocus on the thunder in my head\n\n\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\nBefore I lose my mind again\n\nBefore I lose my mind again",
