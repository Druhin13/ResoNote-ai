  "lyrics": "Fuck a co-sign, doing mine, I was made to shine\r\nLights so bright, little bitch, and I could make you blind\r\nDon't nobody care in this world, everything is cold\r\nLike my heart in the morgue, everything's a tag a toe\r\nI ain't suckin' dick for no play, must be out your mind\r\nGettin' on my knees, tryna please, must be suicide\n\nWe won't get along 'cause it's wrong, I'm not tryna change\n\nThey would do you dirty in a hurry [?]\n\nI don't want your clout or a pic that's a fuckin' joke\n\nSome make me sick with the shit that they tryna smoke\n\nYou can play pretend with your friends that I ain't the shit\n\nYou can keep ignorin' all the facts and what I really did\n\nYou can try to front all my life that I came up\n\nMillion off a mixtape, that's a fact and I don't need to front\n\nPeople think I'm wack, but they suckin' dick\n\nThe money I'm gettin' makes everyone sick\n\n\n\nIt get lonely at the top and I do it by myself\n\nI got everything I want without anybody help\n\nDo you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself\n\nI'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt\n\nIt get lonely at the top and I do it by myself\n\nI got everything I want without anybody help\n\nDo you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself\n\nI'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt\n\n\n\nI don't front for the 'Gram, this is just who I am\n\nI don't ride on no wave, I don't tag on no plan\n\nI don't fuck for no clout, I don't beg for no man\n\nI don't care about fame, I just care about bands\n\nI came out of the mud and I smile 'cause I can\n\nPeople look down on me, on account who I am\n\nAnd they point and they judge, they do not understand\n\nAnd they talking on me but I don't give a damn\n\nBack to back tour, even more, I'm a superstar\n\nThrowin' shots at me, bitch please, I see everything\n\nOnly problem now is your grind make you look weak\n\nI am fuckin' grown, ain't no little girl in the street\n\nI'm nice to all, I don't gotta beef\n\nI just want the bag, and you can have the street\n\n\n\nIt get lonely at the top and I do it by myself\n\nI got everything I want without anybody help\n\nDo you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself\n\nI'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt\n\nIt get lonely at the top and I do it by myself\n\nI got everything I want without anybody help\n\nDo you think I give a fuck? Only care about myself\n\nI'm a stone-cold killer, couple notches on my belt",
