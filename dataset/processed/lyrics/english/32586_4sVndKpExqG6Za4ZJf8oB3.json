  "lyrics": "Closed off from love\r\nI didn't need the pain\r\nOnce or twice was enough\r\nAnd it was all in vain\r\nTime starts to pass\r\nBefore you know it you're frozen\n\n\n\nBut something happened\n\nFor the very first time with you\n\nMy heart melts into the ground\n\nFound something true\n\nAnd everyone's looking round\n\nThinking I'm going crazy\n\n\n\nBut I don't care what they say\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nThey try to pull me away\n\nBut they don't know the truth\n\nMy heart's crippled by the vein\n\nThat I keep on closing\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\n\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open\n\n\n\nTrying hard not to hear\n\nBut they talk so loud\n\nTheir piercing sounds fill my ears\n\nTry to fill me with doubt\n\nYet I know that the goal\n\nIs to keep me from falling\n\n\n\nBut nothing's greater than the risk that comes with your embrace\n\nAnd in this world of loneliness\n\nI see your face\n\nYet everyone around me\n\nThinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe\n\n\n\nBut I don't care what they say\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nThey try to pull me away\n\nBut they don't know the truth\n\nMy heart's crippled by the vein\n\nThat I keep on closing\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\n\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open\n\n\n\nAnd it's draining all of me\n\nOh they find it hard to believe\n\nI'll be wearing these scars\n\nFor everyone to see\n\n\n\nI don't care what they say\n\nI'm in love with you\n\nThey try to pull me away\n\nBut they don't know the truth\n\nMy heart's crippled by the vein\n\nThat I keep on closing\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\n\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\n\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nI keep bleeding\n\nI keep, keep bleeding love\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love\n\nYou cut me open and I\n\nKeep bleeding\n\nKeep, keep bleeding love",
