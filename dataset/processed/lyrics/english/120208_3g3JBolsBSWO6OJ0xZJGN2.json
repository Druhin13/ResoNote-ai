  "lyrics": "So many spend a lifetime\r\nTrying to somehow leave their mark\r\nWaiting and waiting\r\nA grand inspiration to spark\r\nTo leave behind something remembered\r\nSomething everyone has heard of\n\nSome people build it\n\nSome people paint it\n\nAnd some people do it with love\n\n\n\nShakespeare sure knew how to write down\n\nWords that would live throughout time\n\nAnd that Eiffel Tower's still standing\n\nJust meant to be one of a kind\n\nDa Vinci's got his Mona Lisa\n\nAnd Beethoven's got his symphonies\n\nBut you're my masterpiece\n\n\n\nEvery love story ending\n\nIs just fairytails [?]\n\nIt's this kind of story\n\nNo one could ever make up\n\nWe started the day that I met you\n\nAnd this fire won't ever burn out\n\nAnd I know when we die\n\nWhat we leave behind\n\nIt'll always about\n\n\n\nShakespeare sure knew how to write down\n\nWords that would live throughout time\n\nAnd that Eiffel Tower's still standing\n\nJust meant to be one of a kind\n\nDa Vinci's got his Mona Lisa\n\nAnd Beethoven's got his symphonies\n\nBut you're my masterpiece\n\n\n\nShakespeare sure knew how to write down\n\nWords that would live throughout time\n\nAnd that Eiffel Tower's still standing\n\nJust meant to be one of a kind\n\nDa Vinci's got his Mona Lisa\n\nAnd Beethoven's got his symphonies\n\nBut you're my masterpiece\n\nYeah you're my masterpiece",
