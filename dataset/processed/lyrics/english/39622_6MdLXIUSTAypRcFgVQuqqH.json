  "lyrics": "Another Friday night\r\nThere's a line of cars leaving\r\nHome team's got an out-of-towner\r\nMe, I'm sitting on the hood of mine drinking\r\nI'm just a parking lot down-and-outer\n\nUnder that high school bleacher\n\nI drove that preacher's daughter crazy\n\nHer mama was my homeroom teacher\n\nAnd her dad was hell bent on saving me\n\n\n\nYeah, I'm sure there's higher highs\n\nWhere the high risers rise\n\nBut me, I'm gonna sit right here tonight, and\n\n\n\nCatch me a 'round here buzz\n\nCause you ain't 'round here none\n\nKeep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here\n\n'Til my down goes up\n\nLit up like that one stoplight\n\nAcross from that welcome sign\n\nEver since you caught that out there bug\n\nI catch me a 'round here buzz\n\n\n\nI never had big-city eyes\n\nHell, I've never been east of Dallas\n\nGot no idea where you are now\n\nOr if you ever got that penthouse palace\n\n\n\nNo, Scotty's ain't got no vibe\n\nGot no gas in his neon light\n\nBut he's got two-for-one 'til 2:00 tonight\n\n\n\nCatch me a 'round here buzz\n\nCause you ain't 'round here none\n\nKeep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here\n\n'Til my down goes up\n\nLit up like that one stoplight\n\nAcross from that welcome sign\n\nEver since you caught that out there bug\n\nI catch me a 'round here buzz\n\n\n\nCatch me a 'round here buzz\n\nCause you ain't 'round here none\n\nKeep putting 'em down here, 'nother round here\n\n'Til my down here\n\nIs lit up like that one stoplight\n\nAcross from that welcome sign\n\nEver since you caught that out there bug\n\nI catch me a 'round here buzz\n\nI catch me a 'round here buzz\n\n'Round here buzz\n\nI catch me a 'round here buzz",
