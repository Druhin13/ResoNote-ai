  "lyrics": "It's a rocky horror picture show\r\nTossed into an open road\r\nWondering if someone might be home\r\nTaught to love these open doors\r\nCan I stay for supper?\n\nAs I'm lost\n\n\n\nWell of course, now step right in\n\nJust in time, we've just begun\n\nThere are two more seats left, choose just one\n\n\n\nThere's no rush, no telephones\n\nIf you stay, we'll crack your bones\n\nBy dawn\n\n\n\nWon't make it out of here alive\n\nThese eyes, these lips, they never lie\n\nTime in this box is split entirely with my friends\n\nWho may seem impolite\n\nWon't make it out of here alive\n\nThese eyes, these lips, they never lie\n\nTime in this box is split entirely with my friends\n\nWho may seem impolite\n\n\n\nTime is fleeting, I'm still here\n\nThinking as the walls come near\n\nI'd rather keep to myself in here\n\n\n\nThough I'm sure I'm not alone\n\nThe one I came with left me\n\nIn the cold\n\n\n\nTell the host the pleasure's mine\n\nBut I left all my things behind\n\nMy welcome's overstayed and overtime\n\n\n\nSomeone will come look for me\n\nMight be better, wouldn't you agree?\n\nWouldn't you agree, wouldn't you agree?\n\n\n\n(Chorus x2)\n\nWon't make it out of here alive\n\nThese eyes, these lips, they never lie\n\nTime in this box is split entirely with my friends\n\nWho may seem impolite",
