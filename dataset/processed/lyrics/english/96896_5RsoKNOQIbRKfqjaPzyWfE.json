I charge\n\nRipping a beat, a mil in a week, I’m gone\n\nDid a million tweets, and then it repeats, so long!\n\nDid a lot but I’m not even 21\n\nI’m not anyone\n\nWhy these bitches wanna battle? I already won\n\nI ain’t even medicated, my music is medicine\n\nIn the headlights you looking like venison, better run yuh\n\nThis shit too easy for me\n\nHere take my CD for free!\n\nLook at the TV, it’s me\n\nHow he got zero co-signs but he going mainstream with his streams?\n\nSleeping on me like Z Z Z Z\n\nWho’s next up? Well it’s easy to see\n\nThey don’t wanna make a track featuring me\n\nCause it sound like they’re featured on me me me me (me me huh?)\n\n\n\nBack on my mu'fuckin shit uh huh\n\nI got a lotta new drip yuh\n\nJust take a look at my fit uh huh\n\nLook at my fit yeah\n\nYou riding my wave like a ship uh huh\n\nI live my life like a movie huh, you live your live like a clip hahaha\n\n\n\nI do not like haters\n\nCome to your door like a white neighbor huh?\n\nI’ll get it now (that’ll be 580--)\n\nNah I’ll check the price later (--okay?)\n\nI feel like a star and I’m going to war, please get me a lightsaber, huh\n\nIf it ain’t blue? (uh then what?) then it ain’t the right paper (oh)\n\nI feel like a man with the heart of a murderer\n\nLife is a road so I cop a convertible\n\nI am so versatile\n\nYou are so plain (plane) that shit terminal\n\nI had to make my name searchable bitch\n\nThey do not want it to work for the kid\n\nThen when it work they gone work for the kid\n\nEvery move I’m on purpose with shit\n\nThat’s my purpose I’m certainly certain it is\n\n\n\nYuh\n\nAyy\n\n\n\nBack on my mu'fuckin shit uh huh\n\nI got a lotta new drip yuh\n\nJust take a look at my fit uh huh\n\nLook at my fit yeah\n\nYou riding my wave like a ship uh huh\n\nI live my life like a movie huh, you live your life like a clip hahaha",
