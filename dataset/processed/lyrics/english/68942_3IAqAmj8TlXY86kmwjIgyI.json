Yeah\r\nWe used to spend our days and our eves on the phone\r\nFirst day that we both rocking Louis Vuittons? Yeah\r\nI don't know about this chick\n\n'Cause I'm still heartbroken from this motherfucking bitch\n\nWho made me feel like I was never really worth shit\n\nSo you must be dumb if you're interested, right?\n\nYeah, you must be a fool\n\nIf you fall in love with me, and I'm a goddamn loser\n\nSo I abused her\n\nFour years later, and I lose her\n\nGoddamn, I've been distracted for years\n\nThis the first time that I see things clear\n\nLooking back, covering my MacBook in tears\n\n'Cause you did so much and I just didn't care\n\n\n\nWell, that's how things go\n\nWhen you only learn on the long way home\n\nI l-love your girl, but I k-k-know\n\nThat you're happy now, so I'll let it go\n\n\n\nWell, that's how things go\n\nWhen you only learn on the long way home\n\nI l-love your girl, but I k-k-know\n\nThat you're happy now, so I'll let it go\n\n\n\nThey say it hurts like a bitch\n\nBut I swear a bitch never fucking hurt like this\n\nBut I used the pain to change\n\nAnd the music to express what I can't say\n\nRemember back in the day\n\nAt the club, in the line, when you first said \"Hey\"\n\nYou said you were a fan of my grandma\n\nYou love the part where she plays with the camera\n\nNow she's telling me she regrets it ever happened\n\nShe wish she would have spent those years with someone else\n\nAnd kept her confidence, 'cause she used to be\n\nSo secure and sure of what she does and needs\n\nYeah, it hurts to hear, but I know it ain't true\n\n'Cause this boy right here's \"half me\", \"half you\"\n\nI know there's purpose for what we've been through\n\nEven if you don't see it right now, I do\n\n\n\nWell, that's how things go\n\nWhen you only learn on the long way home\n\nI l-love your girl, but I k-k-know\n\nThat you're happy now, so I'll let it go\n\n\n\nWell, that's how things go\n\nWhen you only learn on the long way home\n\nI l-love your girl, but I k-k-know\n\nThat you're happy now, so I'll let it go\n\n\n\nHit me with it one more time",
