  "lyrics": "Part of the thrill\r\nIs you think you might die up there\r\nYou think you might keel over sideways\r\nWouldn't that be something to see?\r\nAnd any guy here\n\nCould learn how to sing like this\n\nShe might love ya\n\nNot like she loves me\n\n\n\nSee I wasn't straight when I wrote that\n\nI was carving a name\n\nAnd I was praying that no one was gonna love me again\n\nAnd I was late for somethin'\n\nEvery hour of every day\n\nAnd completely lonesome out on the prairie\n\nWith a truck full of money\n\n\n\nWhen I got home\n\nOr even halfway love\n\nI had to call you\n\nTo figure out where my partner was\n\nAnd though I know most of my job ain't right\n\nBut you sure don't mind goin' out every night\n\n\n\nSee I wasn't straight when I wrote that\n\nI was carving a name\n\nAnd I was praying that no one was gonna love me again\n\nAnd I was late for somethin'\n\nEvery hour of every day\n\nAnd completely lonesome out on the prairie\n\nWith a truck full of money\n\n\n\nOh no\n\nAhh, yeah\n\n\n\nMaybe someday we'll be\n\nCloser to what our fathers had\n\nPlenty of love never been in\n\nSome truck full of money",
