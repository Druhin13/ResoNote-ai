  "lyrics": "(\"No more music by the suckers\")\r\nThey say love is a funny thing\r\nBut what's funny is the company that money brings\r\nEvery year my circle's getting smaller\r\nNot Ben Baller but never had a thin wallet\n\nI got dollars in different forms of currency\n\nI got problems, but ain't nothing that worry me\n\nAnd I ain't saying that I'm worry-free\n\nI'm just saying nothing's fucking with me currently\n\nShit, I'm my own worst enemy\n\nI make bread just to spend it like it's ten of me\n\nIt's Evidence and people call me by my government\n\nCall me for weed, but don't call me for that other shit\n\nAbsorb the game that was meant to be sold\n\nNot told, I heard good fortune favors the bold\n\nSo I'm standing in the rain, gambling the game\n\nIn the circle rolling dice with a hand full of gold and we go\n\n\n\nYou say you love me, do you really though?\n\nYou just want the world I'm sitting on\n\nAre you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?\n\nI don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong\n\nYou say you love me, do you really though?\n\nYou just want the world I'm sitting on\n\nAre you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?\n\nI don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong\n\n\n\nYou say you love me, but do you though?\n\nTruly though, I see your eyes you let a shooter go\n\nThey'll try to catch me when I'm slipping with the toolie, yo\n\nI just want a Gangsta's Paradise like I'm Coolio\n\nTold my nigga Evidence, I don't leave no evidence\n\nNot a trace, but they gon' know the Wraith was in their residence\n\nThe revenant, comes for the settlement, niggas is so irrelevant\n\nThey gon' try to use you, they gon' want your watch\n\nAnd your chain and your shoes too, niggas will straight abuse you\n\nThey gon' stand there and act like they paid dues too\n\nIf you're right, then stay right\n\nIf you're wrong, then get gone, my nigga, then so long\n\nDo you really want the best for me?\n\nAre you happy when niggas' testing me?\n\nYou just trying to figure out my recipe\n\nYou will never get it, just bounce, nigga, you're stressing me\n\n\n\nYou say you love me, do you really though?\n\nYou just want the world I'm sitting on\n\nAre you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?\n\nI don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong\n\nYou say you love me, do you really though?\n\nYou just want the world I'm sitting on\n\nAre you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?\n\nI don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong\n\n\n\nIf I wasn't on this wave, if I didn't have this come up\n\nWould you love me if I didn't have 9th or Alicia's number?\n\nIf I wasn't with the Roc, would you run and tell your friends\n\nThat you know me and I'm hot? Would I be in your Top 5?\n\nWould you hit me back or see me later and tell me you forgot?\n\nIf I wasn't in that flick standing in front of the ride\n\nWould you wanna make up if we had failed like you had thought?\n\nWould you by my single on iTunes and pay $1.20-something?\n\nAre you like the rest, sheep, blind leading the blind?\n\nWould you praise me even if I didn't have a Dre co-sign?\n\nTell me what you want: new shoes or free tickets?\n\nDon't ask me again, hit Dave if you want Kendrick\n\nI know real love, I listen to Mary J\n\nI can't carry you too, baby, ain't none of you marry Jay\n\nEvery breakup don't make upâ€”the rest of you, Mary Kay\n\nScreaming \"Westside!\", niggas gon' drive me crazy\n\n\n\nYou say you love me, do you really though?\n\nYou just want the world I'm sitting on\n\nAre you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?\n\nI don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong\n\nYou say you love me, do you really though?\n\nYou just want the world I'm sitting on\n\nAre you the type that you get what you want then you're gone?\n\nI don't give a fuck, just know your right from your wrong\n\n\n\n(\"No more music by the suckers\")\n\n\n\n(\"Look into the sky, sunrays pouring down...\")",
