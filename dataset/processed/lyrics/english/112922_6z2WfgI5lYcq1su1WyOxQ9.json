  "lyrics": "There’s a shadow hanging heavy\r\nThere’s a cold chill in my bones\r\nIt’s a steep road, and I am weary\r\nIt’s a long, long way from home\r\nBut I will not shut my eyes\n\nNo, I will not fall silent\n\nCanary in the mine\n\nOh I will, honey I will\n\nI will sing\n\nI will sing\n\n\n\nThere's a madness in a cavern\n\nThere’s a darkness that can blind\n\nWhere it's every man for himself\n\nNo one’s getting out alive\n\n\n\nBut I will not shut my eyes\n\nNo, I will not fall silent\n\nCanary in the mine\n\nOh I will, ooh honey I will\n\nI will sing\n\nI will sing\n\n\n\nSing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, canary sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, come on\n\nSing, sing, sing\n\nSing, sing, sing, canary sing\n\n\n\nOh I will sing\n\nI will sing\n\n\n\nThere’s a shadow hanging o'erhead\n\nThere’s a cold chill in my bones",
