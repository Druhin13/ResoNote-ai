  "lyrics": "From Your sacrifice for the sake of all\r\nRedemption's birth and relentless hope\r\nAs the weight of grace crushed the face of love\r\nAnd You bled and died for Your enemies\r\nTo woo us back from death and woe\n\nA valentine to a faithless world\n\nEvery wayward heart You pursue us all\n\nAnd in kindness call us home\n\n\n\nThis world is Yours\n\nMy God this world is Yours\n\nAll You made to be Yours\n\nI know You love us all\n\n\n\nYour agape love displaces fear\n\nAnd the plan is working, Heaven's near\n\nFor the kingdom comes to the heart that whispers\n\nHave mercy God on me\n\n\n\nYou reign forever\n\nYou reign forevermore\n\nMy heart surrendered\n\nYou reign forevermore",
