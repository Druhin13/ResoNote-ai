  "lyrics": "You died within me\r\nThe boatmen came to sail me down the river\r\nBind me up with visions of a blind man\r\nI operate this way\r\nTurn nothing into gold\r\nDeath on such an ugly day\n\nYou dine like a king on top of the world\n\n\n\nYou show us all\n\nThat forgiveness is the weakest call\n\nAnd now revenge\n\nAgainst that grudge inside your tiny head\n\nRemove the crown of absolution\n\nLet the retribution fly\n\nThe king has all the king has all\n\nBut words can kill and maim and take their toll\n\nAnd you massacre my dreams at night\n\nAnd eat away at every thought\n\nUntil we take control\n\nThe king has all totalitarian and carnivore\n\n\n\nBow down submit to me and kiss the ground\n\nUntil it’s safe to breathe and coexist again\n\nBow down submit to me and kiss the ground\n\nUntil it’s safe to live and coexist again\n\n\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you\n\nBut the sun always shines for you\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you\n\n\n\nYou’d kill to find me\n\nBut the crown above my head is deadly\n\n\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you\n\nThey’re taking away the freedom to be just you",
