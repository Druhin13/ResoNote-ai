  "lyrics": "It was 1989, my thoughts were short my hair was long\r\nCaught somewhere between a boy and man\r\nShe was seventeen and she was far from in-between\r\nIt was summertime in Northern Michigan\r\nAhh Ahh Ahh\r\nAhh Ahh Ahh\n\n\n\nSplashing through the sand bar\n\nTalking by the campfire\n\nIt's the simple things in life, like when and where\n\nWe didn't have no internet\n\nBut man I never will forget\n\nThe way the moonlight shined upon her hair\n\n\n\nAnd we were trying different things\n\nWe were smoking funny things\n\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\n\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\n\nSinging Sweet home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet home Alabama all summer long\n\n\n\nCatching Walleye from the dock\n\nWatching the waves roll off the rocks\n\nShe'll forever hold a spot inside my soul\n\nWe'd blister in the sun\n\nWe couldn't wait for night to come\n\nTo hit that sand and play some rock and roll\n\n\n\nWhile we were trying different things\n\nAnd we were smoking funny things\n\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\n\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\n\nSinging Sweet Home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet Home Alabama all summer long\n\n\n\nNow nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change\n\nOr how we thought those days would never end\n\nSometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along\n\nAnd think man I'd love to see that girl again\n\n\n\nAnd we were trying different things\n\nWe were smoking funny things\n\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\n\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\n\nSinging Sweet home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet home Alabama all summer long\n\nAnd we were trying different things\n\nWe were smoking funny things\n\nMaking love out by the lake to our favorite song\n\nSipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow\n\nSinging Sweet home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet home Alabama all summer long\n\n\n\nSinging Sweet Home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet Home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet Home Alabama all summer long\n\nSinging Sweet Home Alabama all summer long",
