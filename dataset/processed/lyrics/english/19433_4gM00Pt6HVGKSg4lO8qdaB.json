  "lyrics": "Woman, I can't please you\r\nI'll only leave you\r\nSure as the night follows day\r\nIf you start to wonder\r\nIf your spell I'm under\r\nHoney, you should run the other way\n\n\n\nHold on, I'm coming home\n\nYou're giving me a bad desire\n\nYou're giving me a burning fire, in my bones\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna see you tonight one last time\n\nI'll go home and turn off the lights\n\nAnd leave you alone, leave you alone\n\n\n\nWoman, I've got nothing to give you\n\nAnd something else is always on my mind\n\nLittle love drug needing\n\nYou always make me feel\n\nLike for a minute, nothing here is wrong\n\n\n\nSo hold on, I'm coming home\n\nYou're giving me a bad desire\n\nYou're giving me a burning fire in my bones\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna see you tonight one last time\n\nI'll go home and turn off the lights\n\nAnd leave you alone, leave you alone\n\n\n\nI wanna see you tonight\n\nI go home, turn of the lights\n\nAnd leave you alone, leave you alone\n\n\n\nHold on, I'm coming home\n\nYou're giving me a bad desire\n\nYou're giving me a burning fire in my bones\n\n\n\nI wanna see you tonight, one last time",
