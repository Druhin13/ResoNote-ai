  "lyrics": "Love is all about chemistry\r\nIsn't something you go off to school to learn\r\nIt isn't math or ancient history\r\nIt's the kind of thing that comes down to simple terms\r\nIt's not about you\r\nIt's not about me\n\nLove is all about WE\n\nYes, it's all about we\n\n\n\nWant to take you to that great unknown\n\nShow you to a place you've never been\n\nDown a road where only lovers go\n\nBut before we leave, I want to repeat again\n\nIt's not about you\n\nAnd it's not about me\n\nLove is all about we\n\nAll about we\n\n\n\nWith a string you can tie a knot\n\nBut you gotta have somethin' to tie it to\n\nOtherwise all you've got is a knot\n\nWhen it ties me to you,\n\nIt's a whole other thing\n\nCause Love is all about we\n\nLove is all about we\n\n\n\nLove is not about young or old\n\nTouches everybody in a special way\n\nIt's a blanket when the nights are cold\n\nIt can even keep you dry on a rainy day\n\nAnd it's not about you\n\nIt's not about me\n\nLove is all about we\n\nYes, it's all about we\n\n\n\nWith a string you can tie a knot\n\nBut you got to have something to tie it to\n\nOtherwise all you've got is a knot\n\nWhen it ties me to you\n\nIt's a whole other thing\n\nCause Love is all about we\n\nYes it's all about we\n\n\n\nNo, its not about you\n\nIt's not about me\n\nLove is all about we\n\nYes it's all about we\n\nSay it's all about we\n\nYou and me\n\nSay it's all about we\n\nYou and me\n\nWe ah-we ah-we ah-we ah-we\n\nLove is all about we...",
