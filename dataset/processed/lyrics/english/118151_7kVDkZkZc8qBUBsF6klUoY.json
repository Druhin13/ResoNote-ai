  "lyrics": "So here we are\r\nLike we were\r\nTo feed apart\r\nIn different worlds\r\nNo need to say\r\nAnother word\n\nNo, I should leave\n\nBut I donâ€™t wanna go just yet\n\n'Cause I'm not really over it\n\n\n\nYou remind my heart\n\nOf a lie I wish you never told\n\nBut it's all I've got\n\nJust five more minutes and I'm gone\n\nSame old song like an echo, ooh\n\n'Cause I know I'm better off alone\n\nIt is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go\n\n\n\nNow that I know the way it ends\n\nThe words we chose, irrelevant\n\nLet's just pretend a little bit\n\nI know I should leave but\n\nI don't wanna go just yet\n\n'Cause I'm not really over it\n\n\n\nYou remind my heart (You remind my heart)\n\nOf a lie I wish you never told\n\nBut it's all I've got (All I've got)\n\nJust five more minutes and I'll go\n\n(Five more minutes and I'll go)\n\nSame old song like an echo, ooh\n\n'Cause I know I'm better off alone (Better off alone)\n\nIt is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go\n\n\n\nJust five more minutes and I'll go\n\n(Five more minutes and I'll go)\n\nShouldn't stay but I don't wanna go\n\nSame old song like an echo\n\n(I'm better off alone)\n\nIt is my pride and I really know I shouldn't stay but I don't wanna go",
