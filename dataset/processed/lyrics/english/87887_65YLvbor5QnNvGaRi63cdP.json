  "lyrics": "I know Seymour's the greatest\r\nBut I'm dating a semi-sadist\r\nSo I've got a black eye\r\nAnd my arm's in a cast\r\nStill, that Seymour's a cutie\n\nWell, if not, he's got inner beauty\n\nAnd I dream of a place\n\nWhere we could be together at last\n\n\n\nAnd what kind of place is that, honey? An emergency room?\n\n\n\nOh, no. It's just a day dream of mine\n\nA little development I dream of, just off the interstate\n\nNot fancy, like Levittown\n\nJust a little street, in a little suburb, far far from urban Skid Row\n\nOh, I dream about it all the time\n\nJust me, and the toaster, and a sweet little guy...\n\nLike Seymour\n\n\n\nA matchbox of our own\n\nA fence of real chain link\n\nA grill out on the patio\n\nDisposal in the sink\n\nA washer and a dryer and\n\nAn ironing machine\n\nIn a tract house that we share\n\nSomewhere that's green\n\n\n\nHe rakes and trims the grass\n\nHe loves to mow and weed\n\nI cook like Betty Crocker\n\nAnd I look like Donna Reed\n\nThere's plastic on the furniture\n\nTo keep it neat and clean\n\nIn the Pine-Sol scented air\n\nSomewhere that's green\n\n\n\nBetween our frozen dinner\n\nAnd our bed-time: nine-fifteen\n\nWe snuggle watching Lucy\n\nOn our big, enormous\n\nTwelve-inch screen\n\n\n\nI'm his December Bride\n\nHe's father, he knows best\n\nThe kids play Howdy Doody\n\nAs the sun sets in the west\n\nA picture out of Better Homes\n\nAnd Gardens Magazine\n\nFar from Skid Row\n\nI dream we'll go\n\nSomewhere that's... green",
