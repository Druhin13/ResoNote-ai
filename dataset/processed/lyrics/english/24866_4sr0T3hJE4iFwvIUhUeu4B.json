  "lyrics": "I’m lost inside my head\r\nAlways sleeping but never dead\r\nHas time moved on I can't be talked off this ledge\r\nIt’s filling me up, this fear of existing\r\nI'm constantly missing the point of when it started\n\n\n\nYou said you're running running out of time\n\nYou said you're running running out of lies\n\nYou told me that some days you feel like running away\n\nYou feel like running away\n\n\n\nI take a walk through my head\n\nAlways searching around the bend\n\nAs you move on\n\nI’m left to wander instead\n\n\n\nAll of this chasing of my sanity\n\nHas left me torn and depleted\n\nAll this searching inside of me\n\nHas left torn and depleted",
