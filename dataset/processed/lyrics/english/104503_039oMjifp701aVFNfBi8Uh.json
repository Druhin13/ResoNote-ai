  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Fly par Alice In Chains\r\nLed out on a leash behind you, holding ground\nAnd I don't need no reminding, I've been around\nBeen around, yeah, I am a sound, yeah\n\nLie down with your peace where you find it\nWon't come cheap\nFill up on love when you're hungry, tired then sleep\nHave your dreams\n\nDon't let it wind you, let it bring you down\nI hate to tell you how little I have found\n\nThey paved the road with fool's gold\n\nAnd you're gonna fall out\n\nYou're gonna break down, choke and cry\nWaiting out the storm when there ain't no place to hide\nAnd you're gonna fall out\nYou're gonna break down, choke and cry\nWaiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly\n\nAnd you're gonna fall out\nYou're gonna break down, choke and cry\nWaiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly\n\nFollow where it leads, your heart will know what's true\nDon't be blinded by shiny pretty things well past due\nIt's on you, yeah, it's on you, yeah\n\n\nDon't let it wind you, let it bring you down\nI hate to tell you how little I have found\n\nAnd you're gonna fall out\nYou're gonna break down, choke and cry\nWaiting out the storm when there ain't no place to hide\nAnd you're gonna fall out\nYou're gonna break down, choke and cry\nWaiting out the storm till the skies are clear to fly\n\nThey paved the road with fool's gold\nThey paved the road with fool's gold",
