  "lyrics": "I had to leave because\r\nI had to say no and stop\r\nMore than once\r\nWay too many times\r\nAnd you just kept trying to change my mind\n\nSo I left, it was 3am\n\nAnd I slept in the middle of my bed\n\nWith the comfort of my own choices\n\nYeah I bet you didn't even think about what you did\n\n\n\nCould it be true?\n\nYou don't seem like that kind of guy\n\nNot you, you've got that one song that I like\n\nThey said he's got one song that I like\n\n\n\nNow I don't even know why I went\n\nEvery light on the way was screaming at me 'red'\n\nNow you've got me questioning everything I did\n\nOr what would've happened if I'd done one thing different\n\n\n\nAnd I saw it, the face of god\n\nAnd he turned himself away from me\n\nAnd said I did something wrong\n\nThat somehow what happened to me was my fault\n\nYou can see it in apologies, still hear it in the songs\n\n\n\nCould it be true?\n\nYou couldn't do that to someone\n\nNot you, nah your music is too good\n\nThey said your music is too good\n\nKept saying your music is too good\n\nThey said your music is too good",
