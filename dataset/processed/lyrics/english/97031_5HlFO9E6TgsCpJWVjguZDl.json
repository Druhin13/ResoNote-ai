  "lyrics": "We don't have to fall with it\r\nIt doesn't have to be this way\r\nYou're tryna talk me out of it\r\nJust to see if I'll break\r\nSay that I'm done, call it a day\r\nTell me do you ever wonder\n\nHow it can feel holdin' our weight\n\nUnder the pressure we're under\n\n\n\n'Cause usually by now we're sleepin' just fine\n\nBut I've never seen that tired look in your eyes\n\nJust promise me you'll sleep on it\n\nOne more night\n\n\n\n'Cause baby it's too late\n\nTo be packin' up your suitcase now\n\nNo you can't just decide to walk away\n\nJust when things don't go our way\n\nAfter all we've been through\n\nIf this means anything to you\n\nThen stay\n\n\n\nRemember in the beginning\n\nI didn't even know your name\n\nPre drinking in your friend's kitchen\n\nWho'da known that someday\n\nYears down the line, you would be mine\n\nAnd I'd be here stopping you leaving\n\nAnd when we wake up, we'll go back to us\n\nAnd then you'll know every reason\n\n\n\nBaby it's too late\n\nTo be packin' up your suitcase now\n\nNo you can't just decide to walk away\n\nJust when things don't go our way\n\nAfter all we've been through\n\nIf this means anything to you\n\nThen stay\n\nYou, then stay\n\nYou, then stay\n\nYou, then stay\n\n\n\n'Cause usually by now we're sleepin' just fine\n\nBut I've never seen that tired look in your eyes\n\nJust promise me you'll sleep on it\n\nOne more night\n\n\n\n'Cause baby it's too late\n\nTo be packin' up your suitcase now\n\nNo you can't just decide to walk away\n\nJust when things don't go our way\n\nAfter all we've been through\n\nIf this means anything to you\n\nThen stay",
