  "lyrics": "Salvage yard scavenging, bent over backwards\r\nThe caverns are vast and packed to the rafters with decaying corpses\r\nOf course it's important – pertinent details from primary sources\r\nThe voices are louder than ever before, sticking forks into four-legged horses\r\nDeplorable forces conspire to fire the lord and to hire a guy who will try to eat more of the portions\r\nA guy who's more boorish, a guy who's more selfish, with elves as his helpers\n\nHopeless hapless masses are dopes, they suppose\n\nIt's the same old rigamarole that we know, it's as bold as a rodeo\n\nRun with the bulls – all the bullshit is so, so disposable\n\nOpen wounds, broken bones\n\nChoking from smoking these Marlboro hundreds\n\nDysfunctional, fuck up in front of the public\n\nDublin is so far away – it's disgusting the way that these laymen conduct their discussions\n\nBut it's fun to disrupt if yr cussing enough then I call my own bluff, push my luck\n\nHungry husbands are smuggling in drugs with their blood bubbling, boiling\n\nRecoil from the touch of the boys in the club\n\nNoise erupts from the speakers, they scream from the bleachers\n\nCreatures in need of a teacher\n\nThe reason is clear as a really bleached t-shirt\n\nThe fever is reaching its peak – the deceivers are speaking of peace like it's reachable\n\nThe evil are peeking through cracks in the steeple\n\nBelieve it, it's real, 'tis the season\n\nI'm breathing in poison, chest heaving, can't even conceive of the next best thing\n\n“Arrest these heathens! Forget the trial, lock 'em up, toss the key”\n\nDot the T's, cross the I's, lots of apostrophes\n\nCoughing up boxes of bucks to stay lost in the fog of this obnoxious process\n\nMy conscience is quiet, ensconced in the tarpit\n\nCover the garden with carpet, forget and get onto the starship\n\nWe're off to another dimension – the rent's too expensive here\n\nSpent my whole pension improving my penmanship\n\nWhen does it get any closer to ending?\n\nAnd can I just mention the stench?\n\nIt's relentless when in the presence of elegant gentlemen\n\nThe villains have taken their vengeance\n\nI regret to say they've collected the evidence\n\nRepent and pretend every entrance is open to tenants with references\n\nDeclare myself president of the emptiness, say I'm Rembrandt of dancing on the precipice\n\nEleven years in and trying to stay relevant\n\nBut based on what's left of the remnants of my intestines\n\nI would guess I've ingested the medicine\n\nYes, I've been everywhere but everywhere that I've been\n\nI've been out of my element, even in my own skin\n\nAnd I can't begin to think what I'd tell people back home\n\nSo I tell it to the microphone\n\nI can't leave the life alone – yeah",
