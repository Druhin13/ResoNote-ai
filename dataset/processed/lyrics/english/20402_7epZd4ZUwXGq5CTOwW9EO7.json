  "lyrics": "Hey!\r\nHats off to the things you don't say\r\nWhy?\r\nSo what's up with the side-eye?\r\nSpent so long trying to get along\n\nTrying to please you\n\nTrying to tease out all the details\n\nFrom the sad straight notions that just all seem wrong\n\nI defy interpretation\n\nI am not participating in it\n\n\n\nFine!\n\nPick on someone else your own size\n\nFine!\n\nGo prey on some stranger passing by\n\n\n\nHey!\n\nHats off to the things you don't say\n\nWhy?\n\nSo what's up with the side-eye?\n\n\n\nMy sad mind searching overtime\n\nFor a reason\n\nYou suspiciously incorporate some far-fetched fiction you find so sublime\n\nBut it's too late to reject and it's an insult to the fact checkers",
