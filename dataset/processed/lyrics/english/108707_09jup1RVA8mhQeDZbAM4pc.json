  "lyrics": "Not really sure what, I've gotten into\r\nMy hands are shakey, just looking at you\r\nIt's 3am now, everyone's leaving\r\nAnd I'm just frozen\r\nI gotta catch you in the street while you're trying to leave yeah\n\nAt the door of your car with my heart on my sleeve yeah\n\n\n\nListen, I don't always act this way\n\nUsually I would have more to say\n\nI let the moment get the best of me\n\nCan you feel my nervous energy?\n\nI don't always give myself away\n\nIf you had caught me on a different day\n\nI let the moment get the best of me\n\nCan you feel my nervous energy?\n\n\n\nThe moon is lighting up the windows\n\nI kinda like you, but it's not that simple\n\nCause I don't know you, the way I want to\n\nThen again, it's not my head sometimes\n\n\n\nParked in the street and your eyes are on me yeah\n\nGot me feeling so good that it's harder to read you\n\n\n\nListen, I don't always act this way\n\nUsually I would have more to say\n\nI let the moment get the best of me\n\nCan you feel my nervous energy?\n\nI don't always give myself away\n\nIf you had caught me on a different day\n\nI let the moment get the best of me\n\nCan you feel my nervous energy?",
