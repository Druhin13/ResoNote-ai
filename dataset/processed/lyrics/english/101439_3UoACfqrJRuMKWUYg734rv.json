  "lyrics": "Oh, yeah\r\nWhile chasing my dreams\r\nI got lost it seems\r\nWithin the forest deep in my heart\r\nA mirror like a spring\n\nReflecting clearly\n\nA smile like a broken star (broken star)\n\n\n\nEvery tear that fills my eyes\n\nTo gold and silver, they'll never compare\n\nThese ordinary tears of mine\n\nI bet no one will hear my cry\n\n\n\nSo I'll keep on chasing, chasing\n\nMy dream and I'll soar\n\nLike no one's ever done before\n\nAnd I'll keep chasing, chasing\n\nMy dream 'til I'm sure\n\nIt's burning through my soul\n\nA light shining brighter than gold\n\n\n\nAnd I will rise a hero\n\nA light shining brighter than gold\n\nMy life, yeah\n\n\n\nI close my eyes to dream\n\nAnd hear a voice faintly\n\nCalling out to me again\n\nI'm standing alone\n\nMuch too far from home\n\nI gaze into that lonely sky\n\n\n\nI gotta leave and live my life (goodbye)\n\nNo more bitter poison and strife\n\nA world of flowers growing high\n\nYeah, that's the future that I'll find!\n\n\n\nStarting now I'm changing, changing\n\nI swear that I'll soar\n\nLike no one's ever done before\n\nThe future's changing, changing\n\nMy wish and yours\n\nBut soon we will behold\n\nA light shining brighter than gold\n\n\n\nAnd I will rise a hero\n\nA light shining brighter than gold\n\n\n\nHey, see, when life is getting tough\n\nLook up 'cause you gotta remember\n\nWhen you wake up, fix your make up\n\nAll these days so rough\n\nThat you want to fade out\n\nStuck within a nightmare\n\nNo way baby\n\nLeave it all behind when you open your eyes\n\n\n\nThe sunrise reflected in your eyes\n\nA burning and brilliant dawn\n\nBut it's so bright, the future I see\n\nI only hope it comes true\n\n\n\nSo I'll keep on chasing, chasing\n\nMy dream and I'll soar\n\nLike no one's never done before\n\nAnd I'll keep chasing, chasing\n\nMy dream 'til I'm sure\n\nIt's burning through my soul\n\nA light brighter than gold\n\n\n\nAnd I will rise a hero\n\nA light shining brighter than gold",
