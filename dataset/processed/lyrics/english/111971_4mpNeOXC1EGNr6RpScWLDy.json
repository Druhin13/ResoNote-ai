  "lyrics": "A corner dive down on the square\r\nWhere the windows hang with a neon flare\r\nRegulars shoot horse and pool\r\nWhile the barmaid wishes the place half full\r\nShe works the jar with a discount flirt\r\nWith a faded Houston Oilers shirt\n\nWhile an old crow sings down on the stage\n\nThumbing the chords on a crinkled page\n\nHe plays his Zevon tune\n\nBeneath the gulf moon\n\n\n\nTake a walk down along the wall\n\nYou'll go right on past the carnival\n\nHand in hand with the keeper kind\n\nThe kind that ties to the ties that bind\n\nThey don't care for the carnie man\n\nOr the fortune teller that reads your hand\n\nThey just beeline for a bungalow\n\nWhere the curtains flutter\n\nAnd candles glow\n\nIn the heart of June\n\nBeneath the gulf moon\n\n\n\nHere I'm on a midnight porch\n\nLooking up at a butane torch\n\nThat hangs behind a black expanse\n\nWhere stars flicker and planets dance\n\nIt is probably time I pack it in\n\nWith a glass half-full of Jameson\n\nI was born to croon\n\nI might as well\n\nBeneath the gulf moon\n\n\n\nDown by the jetty\n\nNear the Balinese Pier\n\nThe curmudgeons drink the yellow belly beer\n\nAnd they bitch about the price of gas\n\nAnd the fish that they can't seem to catch\n\nThey blame it on the islands way down south\n\nFrom the bayou marsh and the delta mouth\n\nWhere the choppers are rollin, tankers all come\n\nThe midnight daze for the oil drum\n\nThey can't leave too soon\n\nBeneath the gulf moon",
