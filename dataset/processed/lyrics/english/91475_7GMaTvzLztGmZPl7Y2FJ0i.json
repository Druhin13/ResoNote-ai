  "lyrics": "I want Neil Young on your phone speaker in the morning\r\nAnd fuck him if he just can't see\r\nThis is how his songs are supposed to be heard\r\nNo more lectures on fidelity\r\nI don’t believe in mysticism\r\nOnly in what science proves\n\nLike the sex appeal of your sick dance moves\n\nOoh, wee, ooh, wee\n\n\n\nPut on your red beret, baby\n\nMoonwalk naked across the room (ooh, ooh)\n\nDo something kinda unique to me\n\nDo something that'll make me swoon (ooh, ooh)\n\nThat's how I know that I’m not pretending\n\nI know it's not make believe (ooh, ooh)\n\nIt's only complicated if you want it to be\n\nDo you know what I mean? It's byzantine\n\n\n\nI want Hi-Chews, playlists, smoking on the roof\n\nAnd I love the way you look at me\n\nTennessee Williams in Stuart Weitzman boots\n\nJust too wild to believe\n\nA fetish for athletic fashion\n\nRunning shoes and track stripe suits\n\nI never heard of Sparks before\n\nBut I'm so glad you shared them with me\n\n\n\nPut on your red beret, baby\n\nMoonwalk naked across the room (ooh, ooh)\n\nDo something kinda unique to me\n\nDo something that'll make me swoon (ooh, ooh)\n\nThat's how I know that I'm not pretending\n\nI know it’s not make believe (ooh, ooh)\n\nIt’s only complicated if you want it to be\n\nDo you know what I mean? It's byzantine\n\n\n\nRollin’, crashin', breakin', splashing\n\nGivin', takin’, makin', breakin' promises\n\nYou got me high when I was low\n\nNegative ions, come save my soul (soul, soul)\n\n\n\nPut on your red beret, baby\n\nMoonwalk naked across the room (ooh, ooh)\n\nDo something kinda unique to me\n\nDo something that'll make me swoon (ooh, ooh)\n\nThat's how I know that I'm not pretending\n\nI know it's not make believe (ooh, ooh)\n\nIt's only complicated if you want it to be\n\nDo you know what I mean? It's byzantine\n\nIt's byzantine\n\nIt's byzantine\n\nIt's byzantine\n\nIt's byzantine",
