  "lyrics": "It can be a cold winter sunday\r\nThe kind where you can't get out of bed\r\nYou were my El Paso south wind\r\nThe sun that paints my desert red\r\nYou're an amen on a Carolina sand dune\r\nA prayer that washes up on my shore\n\nThe blue sky that cuts through the black night\n\nWhen I can't feel anymore\n\n\n\nYou wrap me up in some kind of magic\n\nLift me up, take me so high\n\nFinally something good for me happened\n\nSuch a rush, can't get enough of your love\n\nShow me every color I can imagine\n\nWhen its November and my soul ain't dark\n\nYou are my June\n\nJune in my Johnny Cash heart\n\n\n\nEverybody's got an addiction\n\nA real good feel good they need\n\nSome trains, they don't hear you coming\n\n'Til they are baring down on you\n\nAnd your demons got you on your knees\n\n\n\nYou wrap me up in some kind of magic\n\nLift me up, take me so high\n\nFinally something good for me happened\n\nSuch a rush, can't get enough of your love\n\nShow me every color I can imagine\n\nWhen its November and my soul ain't dark\n\nYou are my June\n\nJune in my Johnny Cash heart\n\nYeah yeah\n\n\n\nWe can take that cold winter Sunday\n\nSet fire to that Carolina sand dune\n\nGirl, you love the hurt and the hell outta me, yeah\n\n\n\nWhen you wrap me up in some kind of magic\n\nLift me up, take me so high\n\nFinally something good for me happened\n\nSuch a rush, can't get enough of your love\n\nShow me every color I can imagine\n\nWhen its November and my soul ain't dark\n\nYou are my June\n\nJune in my Johnny Cash heart\n\n\n\nYou are my June\n\nYou are my June",
