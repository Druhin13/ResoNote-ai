  "lyrics": "I saw the sun begin to dim\r\nAnd felt that winter wind blow cold\r\nA man learns who is there for him\r\nWhen the glitter fades and the walls wont hold\r\n'Cause from that rubble what remains\r\nCan only be whats true\n\nIf all was lost theres more i gained\n\n'Cause it led me back to you\n\nFrom now on\n\nThese eyes will not be blinded by the light\n\nFrom now on\n\nWhats waited till tomorrow starts tonight, tonight\n\nLet this promise in me start, like an anthem in my heart\n\nFrom now on, from now on\n\nI drank champagne with kings and queens\n\nThe politicians praised my name\n\nBut those were someone elses dreams, the pitfalls of the man i became\n\nFor years and years, i chased their cheers\n\nThe crazy speed of always needing more\n\nBut when i stop\n\nAnd see you here\n\nI remember who all this was for\n\nFrom now on,\n\nThese eyes will not be blinded by the lights\n\nFrom now on\n\nWhats waited till tomorrow starts tonight, it starts tonight\n\nLet this promise in me start,\n\nLike an anthem in my heart\n\nFrom now on\n\nFrom now on\n\nFrom now on\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nFrom now on\n\nThese eyes will not be blinded by the lights\n\nFrom now on\n\nWhats waited till tomorrow starts tonight, it starts tonight\n\nLet this promise in me start, like an anthem in my heart\n\nFrom now on, from now on, from now on\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nAnd we will come back home\n\nHome again",
