  "lyrics": "Just got the mirror on the way out\r\nDon't recognize myself anymore now\r\nBeen running in circles and I can't get out\r\nThe less I know the better it rings loud\r\nJust when you wanna fast forward\n\nYou know it's gonna hurt some more\n\nWhen you feel the fire is gone\n\nI'll pour some gasoline on\n\nI, I, I'll pour some gasoline on\n\nI, I, I'll pour some gasoline on\n\nAnd I might be down but I'm not fucking out\n\n'Cause I need more hours to turn this one around\n\n\n\nI scratched the surface yesterday, I\n\nI know how this one will play out\n\nLet me start you before you start\n\nYou played yours, I played my part\n\nBoth cut from the same cloth\n\n\n\nJust when you wanna fast forward\n\nYou know it's gonna hurt some more\n\nWhen you feel the fire is gone\n\nI'll pour some gasoline on\n\nI, I, I'll pour some gasoline on\n\nI, I, I'll pour some gasoline on\n\nAnd I might be down but I'm not fucking out\n\n'Cause I need more hours to turn this one around\n\nI, I, I, I\n\n\n\nI know you miss the old days, the old days are gone\n\nEverything you've got isn't what you want\n\nI know you miss the old days, the old days are gone\n\nEverything you've got isn't what you want\n\n\n\nWhen you wanna fast forward\n\nYou know it's gonna hurt some more\n\nWhen you feel the fire is gone\n\nI'll pour some gasoline on\n\nI, I, I'll pour some gasoline on\n\nI, I, I'll pour some gasoline on\n\nAnd I might be down but I'm not fucking out\n\n'Cause I need more hours to turn this one around\n\nI, I, I, I",
