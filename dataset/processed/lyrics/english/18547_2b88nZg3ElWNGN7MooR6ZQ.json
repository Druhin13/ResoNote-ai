  "lyrics": "I used to sleep through the broadcasts\r\nThat told us of wars past, a tragic hindsight The earth is eroding, we’ll haze our blue sky\r\nDo you think it’s fair to sit idly by?\r\nWe wonder what we once were because what was frozen is melting now\r\nTired eyes, there’s no sunlight\n\nClimates rise\n\nWe won’t sleep at night\n\n\n\nForfeit the only health that you have left\n\nDon’t let them sell our souls again, cause’ this corruption scorched the very place you live\n\n\n\nWatch the angels fall\n\nSinging a song of our tragic fate\n\n“It’s a shame that you’re all to blame”\n\nOur sin builds up the debris\n\nOur greed spills into the sea\n\nSlowly but certainly the end is coming\n\n\n\nTired eyes, there’s no sunlight\n\nClimates rise\n\nWe won’t sleep at night\n\nI’ll never be your alibi\n\nTired eyes, we won’t sleep at night\n\n\n\nAll we are is an enemy\n\nAll we need is a remedy\n\n\n\nTired eyes, there’s no sunlight\n\nClimates rise\n\nWe won’t sleep at night\n\nI’ll never have the strength to fight\n\nTired eyes, we won’t sleep at night",
