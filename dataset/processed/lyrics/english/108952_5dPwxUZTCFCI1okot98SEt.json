  "lyrics": "Now, when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks\rThe night is so black that the darkness cooks\rDon't you come creepin' around\rmakin' me do things I don't want to\rCan't believe that you need my love so bad\rCome sneakin' around tryin' to drive me mad\rBustin' in on my dreams\rmaking me see things I don't wanna see\r'Cause you're da Green Manalishi with the two prong crown\rAll my tryin' is up\rall your bringin' is down\rJust taking my love then slippin' away\rLeavin' me here jus t tryin' to keep from following you",
