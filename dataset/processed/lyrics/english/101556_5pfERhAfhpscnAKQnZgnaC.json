  "lyrics": "Violence is the fruit of unreached understanding that flower from the lips of scoundrels\r\nIt is a forest so dense and rooted in our past\r\nIt tempts us to become lost in its darkness\r\nAnd stinks like the piss test you were forced to take\r\nJust before you were told that you didn’t meet\r\nThe standards of integrity that this organization strives to maintain\n\n\n\nWhy are there no folk songs about ATM machines\n\nThat produce the likeness of the blazer of the trail of tears\n\nIssuing overdraft fees from beyond the grave\n\nPrison TV shows in an endless queue\n\nContaining the robust nourishment of a commissary\n\nThis is why we cannot afford to close an open casket\n\nYou protect no one by obscuring the mirror that reflects our own problematic reality\n\nAllow me to ponder the role I play\n\nIn this pornographic spectacle of black death\n\nAt once a solution and a problem\n\n\n\nA cause, an effect, a rejoice, a regret\n\nViolence is daily life\n\nA promise a pact that the world never kept\n\nViolence is daily life\n\n\n\nA cause, an effect, a rejoice, a regret\n\nViolence is daily life\n\nA promise a pact that the world never kept\n\nViolence is daily life\n\n\n\nViolence is daily life\n\nViolence happens every day\n\nIt's hard to get used to getting used to violence\n\n\n\nSavage is my name because Savage is how I feel\n\nWhen the radio wakes me up with the words “suspected gunman”\n\nMy name is a warning for the acts you are about to witness\n\nWhich contain images that some viewers may find disturbing\n\nMy name belongs to us all\n\nSo if they ask for yours give them mine\n\nMy name is a threat\n\n\n\nRiot is an unfinished grave that was dug to deposit undepleted anger\n\nLike barrels of uranium leaking into something sacred\n\nIt is a word to use to delegitimize your unrest\n\nAnd to make your resistance into an overreaction\n\n\n\nThe pink tube of paint called flesh\n\nUsed in portraits of chairmen of boards and\n\nMen who clean up streets named after those who fought\n\nFor erasing the lives they now claim to protect\n\nWhat is an up and coming neighborhood and where is it coming from?\n\n\n\nA cause, an effect, a rejoice, a regret\n\nViolence is daily life\n\nA promise a pact that the world never kept\n\nViolence is daily life\n\n\n\nA cause, an effect, a rejoice, a regret\n\nViolence is daily life\n\nA promise a pact that the world never kept\n\nViolence is daily life",
