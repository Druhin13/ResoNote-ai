  "lyrics": "Saturday I love you like gold\r\nNot like the monday, you passed like a ghost\r\nThe fire killed you like a motherless child\r\nI saw you at sunday at Barbara Hotel\r\noh oh oh oh oh- oh babe I'm so sorry\r\nAnd nowhere to go\n\n\n\nCould scream like a pig, Could bark like a dog\n\nJust to get attention as I'm chasing you down the hall\n\noh maybelin you´ve been so lonely\n\nGot the fire burning as I`m smoking you out again\n\nStill all the leaves keep on falling\n\nuntil I see you dancing on the table 45 again\n\n\n\nSee her dancing for the young wolves oh oh oh\n\nMaybellene i hofteholdere\n\nCould you be the only one\n\noh I beg you to come home\n\nDance forever my only one\n\n\n\nCould scream like a pig, Could bark like a dog\n\nJust to get attention as I´m chasing you down the hall\n\noh maybellene you´ve been so lonely\n\nGot a fire burning as I smoke you out again\n\n\n\nSee her dancing for the young wolves oh oh oh\n\nMaybellene i hofteholdere\n\n\n\nSee her dancing for the young wolves oh oh oh\n\nMaybellene i hofteholdere\n\nCould you be the only one\n\noh I beg you to come home\n\nDance forever my only one\n\n\n\nI flicked the switch at monday night\n\nOh Maybellene I´m so sorry that I didn´t see it comming\n\nand the sky is filled with prayers\n\noh baby I´m so sorry I was blind\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Tichga for these lyrics)",
