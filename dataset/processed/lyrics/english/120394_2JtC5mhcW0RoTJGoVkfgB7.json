  "lyrics": "I will do your interview\r\nTry to explain what I'm goin' through\r\nGive you somethin' to read into\r\nIn a million different ways\r\nA sick version of telephone\r\nStarts at the clip of the microphone\n\nA game we thought we had all outgrown\n\nBut still everybody plays\n\n\n\nIgnoring all of the remedies\n\nBelieving all of the rumors\n\nWith their endless database\n\nI wanna sit with my enemies\n\nAnd say, \"We should have done this sooner\"\n\nWhile I look them in the face\n\nMaybe that would crack the case\n\n\n\nI got a friend who's been thinkin' 'bout\n\nFinally kickin' her husband out\n\nHis second life as a talent scout\n\nFinally got him caught\n\nWhile she was throwin' out all his clothes\n\nShe heard a voice from beyond the throes\n\n\"Punish him for the life he chose\n\n\"But forgive the past that he did not!\"\n\n\n\nIt's really hard to hate anyone\n\nWhen you know what they've lived through\n\nAnd once they've given you a taste\n\nShe said, \"This is for you to overcome\n\n\"But I will always love you\"\n\nIn her perfect state of grace\n\nMaybe that would crack the case\n\n\n\nNow that we're through with formalities\n\nWhat is it you wanna ask of me?\n\nI'll answer open and honestly\n\nWhatever that means\n\nFindin' out that we occupy\n\nSomebody else's opposin' side\n\nOn the banks of some great divide\n\nTwo versions of a dream\n\n\n\nCountless revisions of history\n\nTryin' to tell us the future\n\nBetween each commercial break\n\nI wanna call off the cavalry\n\nDeclare no winners or losers\n\nAnd forgive our shared mistakes\n\nYou can pick the time and place\n\nMaybe that would crack the case",
