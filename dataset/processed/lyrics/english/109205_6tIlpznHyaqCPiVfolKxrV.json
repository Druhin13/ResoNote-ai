  "lyrics": "I see through your eyes\r\nYou breathe with my lungs\r\nI strain with your ear to make out\r\nThe words your mother sung\r\nI bless with your hand (I bless with your hand)\r\nYou pray on my knees (you pray on my knees)\n\nIt's my blood in your veins\n\nAnd your heart is beating in me\n\n\n\nFinally when will it be enough\n\nTo find there's no them\n\nThere is only us\n\nThere's only us\n\n\n\nI strike with your fist\n\nYou shoot with my gun\n\nWe spit in your face with my mouth\n\nAnd curse me with your tongue\n\nWe cast us aside (we cast us aside)\n\nWe silence our plea (we silence our plea)\n\nBut the system that terrifies you\n\nShould terrify me\n\n\n\nFinally when will it be enough\n\nTo find there's no them\n\nThere is only us\n\nFinally when will it be enough\n\nTo find there's no them\n\nThere is only us\n\nThere's only us\n\n\n\nWe burn at our stakes\n\nWe die by our swords\n\nWe choke in our trenches\n\nWe drown in our wars\n\nWe're locked in our chains\n\nThough we long to be free\n\nWe keep building walls\n\nTill it's so hard to see\n\nWe are one with everything\n\nWe are one\n\nBut it's so hard to see\n\n\n\nFinally when will it be enough\n\nTo find there's no them\n\nThere is only us\n\nFinally when will it be enough\n\nTo find there's no them\n\nThere is only us\n\nThere's only us",
