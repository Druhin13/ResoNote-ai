  "lyrics": "Verse 1 Refrain Verse 2 Verse 3 \nI've been sittin' here \nTryin' to find myself \nI need to get behind myself \nI need to rewind myself \nLookin' for the payback \n\nListen for the playback \n\nAnd they say that every man bleeds just like me \n\nAnd I feel like number one \n\nEven when I'm last in line \n\nI watch my youngest son \n\nIt helps to pass the time \n\nI take too many pills \n\nTryin' to ease the pain \n\nI made a bunch a dollar bills \n\nBut still I act the same \n\nEverybody knows my name \n\nThey say it way out loud \n\nPeople try to comfort me \n\nBut it's hard to hang out in a crowd \n\nI guess that's the price you pay \n\nTo be some big star like I am \n\nOutstretched hands and one night stands \n\nBut still I can't find love \n\nNo, I can't find love \n\nCan't find love \n\n\n\nWhen it all comes tumbling down \n\nI will still be hangin' 'round \n\n\n\nPeople don't know about the things I say and do \n\nThey don't understand, all the hard times I've been through \n\nIts been so long \n\nSince I've been home \n\nLord you know it, I've been gone for much too long \n\nMaybe I forgot all the things I miss \n\nIn my heart I know there's gotta be more to life than this \n\nMore to life than this \n\nHey-Ye this \n\n\n\nWhen it all comes tumbling down \n\nI will still be hangin' 'round \n\n\n\nI said it so many times \n\nAnd I still stand firm \n\nYou get what you put in, givin' these people what they deserve \n\nGivin' 'em what they deserve \n\nStill I ain't seen lights \n\nFor the days and nights \n\nMy life's a stage for the flashy lights \n\nPeople talk about me \n\nBut I don't cry \n\nI just keep walking with my head held high \n\nI can't lose it all \n\nBut only God knows \n\nOnly God knows, why \n\nOnly God knows why \n\nWhy, why, why \n\nOnly God knows why\n\nWhy, why, why",
