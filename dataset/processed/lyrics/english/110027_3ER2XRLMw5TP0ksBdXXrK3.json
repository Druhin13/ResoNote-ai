  "lyrics": "Oh my mind is made up about you\r\nNow and always\r\nThough the seasons come and they go\r\nNothing will ever change\r\nWell I took a little chance\n\nAnd I laid my heart down\n\nI thought you'd be the one\n\nWho would always stick around\n\n\n\nI took a little time\n\nThough I knew it would be\n\nThat we had a date with destiny\n\n\n\nWell out of the darkness\n\nAnd out of the long black night\n\nYou have given me heart, yes\n\nAnd you showed me the light\n\nAnd I do, I do\n\nI love you for what you are\n\n\n\nWell this heart of mine\n\nI know it so well\n\nThere are so many strange stories\n\nThat I could tell\n\nMany is a time\n\nI went out on a limb\n\nYou reached out for me baby\n\nAnd you brought me back again\n\n\n\nA lot of stormy nights\n\nI've seen many a full moon, but darling\n\nThis is love in the afternoon\n\n\n\nWell out of the darkness\n\nAnd out of the long black night\n\nYou have given me heart, yes\n\nAnd you showed me the light\n\nAnd I do, I do\n\nI love you for what you are\n\n\n\nSo out of the darkness\n\nAnd out of the long black night\n\nYou have given me heart, yes\n\nAnd you showed me the light\n\nAnd I do, I do\n\nI love you for what you are\n\n\n\nYes I love you for what you are\n\n\n\nI love you for what you are\n\nI do love you for what you are\n\nYes I do love you for what you are...",
