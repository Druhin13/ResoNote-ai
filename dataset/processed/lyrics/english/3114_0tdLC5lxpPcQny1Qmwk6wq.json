  "lyrics": "It's too dark\r\nto put the keys\r\nin my ignition,\r\nAnd the mornin' sun is yet\r\nto climb my hood ornament.\r\nBut before too long I might\n\nsee those flashing red lights\n\nLook out, mama,\n\n'cause I'm comin' home tonight.\n\n\n\nThink I'll\n\nroll another number\n\nfor the road,\n\nI feel able to get under any load.\n\nThough my feet\n\naren't on the ground,\n\nI been standin' on the sound\n\nOf some open-hearted people\n\ngoin' down.\n\n\n\nI'm not goin' back\n\nto Woodstock for a while,\n\nThough I long to hear\n\nthat lonesome hippie smile.\n\nI'm a million miles away\n\nfrom that helicopter day\n\nNo, I don't believe\n\nI'll be goin' back that way.\n\n\n\nThink I'll\n\nroll another number\n\nfor the road,\n\nI feel able to get under any load.\n\nThough my feet\n\naren't on the ground,\n\nI been standin' on the sound\n\nOf some open-hearted people\n\ngoin' down.",
