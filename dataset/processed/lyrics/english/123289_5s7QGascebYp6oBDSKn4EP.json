  "lyrics": "Aurora borealis\r\nThe icy sky at night\r\nPaddles cut the water\r\nIn a long and hurried flight\r\nFrom the white man\r\nto the fields of green\n\nAnd the homeland\n\nwe've never seen.\n\n\n\nThey killed us in our tepee\n\nAnd they cut our women down\n\nThey might have left some babies\n\nCryin' on the ground\n\nBut the firesticks\n\nand the wagons come\n\nAnd the night falls\n\non the setting sun.\n\n\n\nThey massacred the buffalo\n\nKitty corner from the bank\n\nThe taxis run across my feet\n\nAnd my eyes have turned to blanks\n\nIn my little box\n\nat the top of the stairs\n\nWith my Indian rug\n\nand a pipe to share.\n\n\n\nI wish a was a trapper\n\nI would give thousand pelts\n\nTo sleep with Pocahontas\n\nAnd find out how she felt\n\nIn the mornin'\n\non the fields of green\n\nIn the homeland\n\nwe've never seen.\n\n\n\nAnd maybe Marlon Brando\n\nWill be there by the fire\n\nWe'll sit and talk of Hollywood\n\nAnd the good things there for hire\n\nAnd the Astrodome\n\nand the first tepee\n\nMarlon Brando, Pocahontas and me\n\nMarlon Brando, Pocahontas and me\n\nPocahontas.",
