  "lyrics": "Well, baby used to stay out all night long \nShe made me cry, she done me wrong \nShe hurt my eyes open, that's no lie \nTables turn and now her turn to cry \n\nBecause I used to love her, but it's all over now \n\nBecause I used to love her, but it's all over now \n\n\n\nWell, she used to run around with every man in town \n\nShe spent all my money, playing her high class game \n\nShe put me out, it was a pity how I cried \n\nTables turn and now her turn to cry \n\n\n\nBecause I used to love her, but it's all over now \n\nBecause I used to love her, but it's all over now \n\n\n\nWell, I used to walk in the morning, get my breakfast in bed \n\nWhen I'd gotten worried she'd ease my aching head \n\nBut now she's here and there, with every man in town \n\nStill trying to take me for that same old clown \n\n\n\nBecause I used to love her, but it's all over now \n\nBecause I used to love her, but it's all over now \n\nBecause I used to love her \n\nbut it's all over now",
