  "lyrics": "Maybe I succeed a little\r\nI jumped up from the floor to the middle\r\nYou think I want the credit I don't\r\nCause the glory, ain't made for me, no\r\nI know who sits on the throne\n\nWho makes the stage and writes the songs\n\nAnd I know I, couldn't do this on my own\n\nAnd as much as I complain\n\nI've seen more sunshine than rain\n\n\n\nAnd I could thank, my lucky stars\n\nBut that's not where, my blessings are\n\nNo they come from, the Father's heart\n\nNot the sky, not chance, but truth is\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\n\n\nToday I'm in a happy place\n\nAnd I know it didn't happen by mistake\n\nI love how He wrote my life\n\nAnd I love how He sees my heart\n\nSo I fall to my knees and say that I'm grateful\n\nFor every morning start\n\n\n\nSo I could thank, my lucky stars\n\nBut that's not where, my blessings are\n\nNo they come from, the Father's heart\n\nNot the sky, not chance, but truth is\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\n\n\nFrom the very beginning\n\nThis life that I'm living\n\nWas part of Your plan all along\n\n\n\nSo I don't thank, my lucky stars\n\nCause that's not where, my blessings are\n\nNo they come from, the Father's heart\n\nNot the sky, not chance, but truth is\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\n\n\nSing yes, Jesus loves me\n\nSing yes, Jesus loves me\n\nSing yes, Jesus loves me\n\nFor the bible tells me\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved\n\n\n\nC'mon one more time\n\nLet me hear you sing\n\n\n\nYes, Jesus loves me\n\nSing yes, Jesus loves me\n\nYes, Jesus loves me\n\nFor the bible tells me so\n\nYeah\n\nIt tells me so\n\n\n\nSee I don't thank, my lucky stars\n\nCause that's not where, my blessings are\n\nNo they come from, the Father's heart\n\nNot the sky, not chance, but truth is\n\nI'm not lucky, I'm loved",
