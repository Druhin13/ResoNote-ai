  "lyrics": "I had thought it was the beginning of a solid adolescence, but I think it was this other thing, a more mature\r\nAn understanding that nobody could ever have\r\nIf we were [?] we got the lights on\r\nWhy do I hang on every word?\r\nAnd if it's not, if it's not some kind of symmetry\n\nWhere the line's so blurred\n\n\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\n\n\nIf we are only for the moment\n\nWhy do we talk about our dreams?\n\nAnd if it's not, if it's not some kind of poetry\n\nWhy do I wonder what it means?\n\n\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\n\n\nWe won't call this love\n\n\n\nThere is no warmth around the edges\n\nAround the edges of the pain\n\nWe wear this down until it's nothing\n\nAnd I will see you then, again\n\n\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\n\n\nWe won't call this love\n\n\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\nSo if you're gonna use me, then use me up\n\n\n\nWe won't call this love",
