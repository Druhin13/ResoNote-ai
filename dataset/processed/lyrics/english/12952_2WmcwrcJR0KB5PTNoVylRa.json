  "lyrics": "Yeah, yeah, ahem\r\nYeah, I woke up feeling black couldn't be better\r\nSon woke up with that shine couldn't beat the weather\r\nSon woke up feeling fly didn't need a feather\r\nThese the letters, me, a G forever, you get a e for effort\n\nDon't lower case me, no don't play me that's a big G\n\nBeen moving 88 keys a week since I was 15\n\nSunday morning special, ebony, and ivories\n\nYou can find me with the bands while the choir sings\n\nFrankly, it's understood, I ain't Frank Lucas, even less Underwood\n\nI'm more Frank Kay, next to where Laurence stood\n\nThat's a hey, whole choir boy from the hood\n\nYeah I'm from the same soil as Gloria James' son\n\nGassin' my hood up, my oil need a change, uh, ain't nothing\n\n3:30 ain't the time it's the code, 3:30 ain't a line it's my mode\n\nI think I'm gettin' back to the old me\n\nWithout that Cali boy, really you don't know me\n\nHad to get the rings so I left\n\nStill home, got it inked on my left\n\nWalkin' in like I'm the man of the year\n\nHeard a lot of no, now I'm the man of the yeah\n\nIt's no problem that the Trinity can't answer back to\n\nBig 3 over my head so please don't Chance The Rapper\n\nI'm back bruh\n\n\n\nI woke up feeling black, proud to be out here\n\nThe crew is stacked, ain't just me out here\n\nWho is that? Homie Kareem out here\n\nMore than some tees out here\n\nWe screaming, \"We out here\"\n\nGotta find a way to monetize black twitter\n\nSo they gotta pay if they tryna laugh with us\n\nEyes on the prize, are we there yet? Nope\n\nEyes to the skies, what you staring at? Hope\n\nI think I'm getting back to the old me\n\nThat \"screw your man-tan, new age, minstrel show\" me\n\nNot bamboozled everything black God given\n\nSo when they tell me, \"Fall back\" Y'all tripping\n\nThe narratives ain't similar, they parallel\n\nOn heaven as it is on earth, the paracletes to parasail\n\nReformed is not a label I want you to tag me with\n\nThe reformation was for Catholics not Africans\n\nI'm black, some days too much\n\nFeeling strapped, tryna pay bills with two bucks\n\nFeeling wack, watching other cats move up\n\nFeeling trapped, like you shooting craps, you stuck\n\nBelieve me, feel like an all day job, it ain't easy\n\nBeing black is dumb hard\n\nSomebody always saying that we pull the race card\n\nThen America turned around and pulled the Trump card\n\nOn guard when the squad car pop guns off\n\nIf you comply, resist, or you run off\n\nSee your one crime is your skin, if your tone's dark\n\nYou're the lead role, getting killed on the film, with the phone's out\n\nWhose the next victim getting screwed by the system\n\nWould they dig you a grave, or would they make you a slave\n\nDirt cheap tombstone or 13th loophole just to make you behave\n\nIt's insane",
