  "lyrics": "Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling\r\nFrom glen to glen, and down the mountain side\r\nThe summer's gone, and all the roses falling\r\n'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.\r\nBut come ye back when summer's in the meadow\n\nOr when the valley's hushed and white with snow\n\n'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow\n\nOh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.\n\n\n\nBut when he come, and all the flowers are dying\n\nIf I am dead, as dead I well may be\n\nYou'll come and find the place where I am lying\n\nAnd kneel and say an \"Ave\" there for me.\n\n\n\nAnd I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me\n\nAnd all my grave will warm and sweeter be\n\nFor you will bend and tell me that you love me\n\nAnd I shall sleep in peace until you come to me",
