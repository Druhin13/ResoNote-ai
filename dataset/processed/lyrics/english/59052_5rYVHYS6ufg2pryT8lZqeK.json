  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Counting Down the Years par Whyte Horses\r\nAnd so another letter falls\nA chime goes off again\nA thud upon the doormat, like a knife\nReads out the story of your life\nA view of every shade of grey\nThe buildings loom above\nNo way is the only way\nWhite flags are blowing nearer\n\nI was busy doing nothing much\nNot hurting anyone at all\nAnd then the big announcement here\nThat you were counting down the years\nWhen will I wake up? Oh\n\nToo much of anything's too much\n\nIt's not all sex and sea\nA sticky hand is working overtime\nTrying to make the perfect crime\nA golden spoon or destitute\nThe oldest tale of all\nSomeone loses and someone wins\nAnd on and on forever\n\nI was hearing sounds from all around\nWas almost back to being myself\nBut then your booming voice came loud\nDispelling all my efforts\nSometimes it's a must to deviate\nSome things are better left unsaid\nWhile I was ticking off my fears\nThere you were counting down the years\nWhen will I wake up? Oh\n\n\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nNo, don't die yet\nHow do I get through this?\nHow do I get through this?\nHow\nHow\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet / Your eyes are laughing\nDon't die yet / They're laughing\nDon't die yet / Your eyes are laughing\nDon't die yet / They're laughing\nDon't die yet / Your eyes are laughing\n\nDon't die yet / They're laughing\nNo, don't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nDon't die yet\nNo, don't die yet",
