(ooh)\n\nKamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note\n\nHere come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me\n\n'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes\n\n'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone\n\nI don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go\n\nEyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—\n\n\n\nSmash into everyone, crash into everything\n\nBack and I've just begun, \"FACK\" 2017\n\nFack, fack on everyone\n\nFack, fack on everyone\n\nFack, fack on everyone\n\nI'm a Kamikaze, gonna\n\nSmash into everyone, crash like an F-15\n\nDamage already done, y'all should've let me be\n\nFack, fack on everyone\n\nFack, fack on everyone\n\nFack, fack on everyone\n\nI'm a Kamikaze, gonna\n\n\n\nSmash\n\nKamikaze, kamikaze\n\nKamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze\n\nLook at what I've done\n\n\n\nI heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing\n\nThere is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee\n\nThat way that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air\n\nThe shit's embarrassing, as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare\n\nIn my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher\n\nEach nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me\n\nLyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared\n\nRichard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is\n\n\n\nWait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'\n\nSomethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist\n\nBut somethin' here is afoot—oh yeah, it's my dick\n\nGet the measurement stick (what?), twelve inches of wood\n\nWait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert\n\nAnd I've come to pay respects\n\n'Cause if you sleep you're fucked: other words, you get laid to rest\n\nAnd I hope your butt is hurt\n\nPut me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book\n\nYou got some views, but you're still below me\n\nMine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked\n\nAnd I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook\n\nAnd now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth\n\nAnd you know I've always spoke the truth\n\nYou lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth\n\nAnd it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do\n\nWhen I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm s'posed to do\n\nLine up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot",
