  "lyrics": "I'm trying not to think about you\r\nI know I gotta make my own moves\r\nI wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you\r\nI wanna give you your space\r\nI wanna give you your space\r\nI wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you\n\nI wanna give you your space\n\nYeah, wanna give you your space\n\nI'm just tryna give you your space\n\nWanna give you your space, yeah\n\n\n\nLately I've just been thinking of giving you space\n\nIt's like nothing's really fitting in place\n\nMemories, they fade, but they never erase\n\nGuess my biggest fear is being replaced\n\nLook, couldn't find what was missing\n\nI had to keep a distance\n\nLiquor still in my system, sipping the pain, gripping\n\nI'm subtracting the negatives, now I feel the difference\n\nBut somehow I still feel lonely, I'm probably tripping, fuck\n\nFeelings I never show\n\nWhat comes out through the pain? I guess you'll never know\n\nSay you need time alone, fuck it, I get it though\n\nI'm just stuck between holding on and letting go\n\nYeah, guess we need to work on ourselves more\n\nYou the only one that I'm down for\n\nYou an angel I'm willing to go through hell for, look\n\nBut now I'm trying not to think about you\n\n\n\nI'm trying not to think about you\n\nI know I gotta make my own moves\n\nI wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you\n\nI wanna give you your space\n\nI wanna give you your space\n\nI wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you\n\nI wanna give you your space\n\nYeah, wanna give you your space\n\nI'm just tryna give you your space\n\nWanna give you your space, yeah\n\n\n\nLately I've just been thinking of giving you space\n\nIt's like nothing's really fitting in place\n\nMemories, they fade, but they never erase\n\nNah, they never erase\n\nLately I've just been thinking of giving you space\n\nIt's like nothings really fitting in place\n\nMemories, they fade, but they never erase\n\nNah, they never erase\n\n\n\nI'm trying not to think about you\n\nI know I gotta make my own moves\n\nI wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you\n\nI wanna give you your space\n\nI wanna give you your space\n\nI wanna stay in my lane without crashing into you\n\nI wanna give you your space",
