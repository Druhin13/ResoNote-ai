  "lyrics": "The ether realm declares the world but a stage\r\nA coldly calculated transformation to the grave\r\nOnward we follow, herded as slaves\r\nCollectively lapsing into the land of flame\r\nAlas, the truth has been presented before my eyes\r\nIâ€™ve been unbound from the shackles of faith\n\nNo longer lead to believe there is hope beyond this world\n\nThe rope starts to sway\n\nThe voices died one by one as they called my name\n\nWept until the body could no longer feel the pain\n\nAnd naught a thing to blame\n\nTrapped in a shell of excessive disdain\n\nUnder the moonlight I yield\n\nFor I am not enslaved, but one of many of those who kneel\n\nThe reasons, the answers will follow me to the grave\n\nUnder the moonlight I yield\n\nVenture beyond and prepare the final phase\n\nNow I look beyond the black eclipse\n\nThe macrocosm of the divine\n\nThe sullen moon pulls at my soul, a beckoning for relinquishment\n\nLike the tides under lunar influence\n\nThe urge is relentless I venture beyond\n\nThe voices died one by one as they called my name\n\nWept until the body could no longer feel the pain\n\nAnd naught a thing to blame\n\nTrapped in a shell of excessive disdain\n\nUnder the moonlight I yield\n\nFor I am not enslaved, but one of many of those who kneel\n\nThe veil beyond cries my name\n\nI have left behind all that I love, and all who commit\n\nMy soul in the hands of destiny\n\nBriefly embracing the chill of Dimethyltryptamine\n\nA struggle for many is the end of the few\n\nA cancer that no mortal man can elude\n\nI hang in my sorrow with no dispute\n\nJust know I'm sorry, I swear to you",
