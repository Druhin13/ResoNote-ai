No, no, no, now that's all wrong\n\nThis thing will never make a present\n\nIt's been dead for much too long\n\nTry something fresher, something pleasant\n\nAll together, that and this\n\nWith all our tricks we're making Christmas time\n\n\n\n'Cause when the full moon starts to climb\n\nWe'll all sing out\n\nIt's Christmas time",
