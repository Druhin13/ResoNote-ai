  "lyrics": "Long night, wake up\r\nTears in your makeup\r\nCry in the kitchen\r\nQuiet conviction\r\nSay that you're leaving\r\nThink you don't need me\n\nWell, that's probably true but\n\nI still need you 'cause\n\n\n\nI'm a mess these days\n\nNo, you don't have to stay\n\n\n\nJust take me with you when you go, go, go\n\nI know the things I said before, oh no\n\nDon't let it come between us\n\nJust hold on to the feeling\n\nWhen the distance starts to grow, grow, grow\n\nJust take me with you when you go\n\n\n\nSix weeks, six months\n\nI forget how long\n\nI kept you waiting\n\nTesting your patience\n\nOur hearts don't break\n\nThey just rearrange\n\nCover the bruises\n\nTry to get through this, but\n\n\n\nI'm a mess these days\n\nNo, you don't have to stay\n\n\n\nJust take me with you when you go, go, go\n\nI know the things I said before, oh no\n\nDon't let it come between us\n\nJust hold on to the feeling\n\nWhen the distance starts to grow, grow, grow\n\nJust take me with you when you go\n\n\n\nDeep down in your soul\n\nIt's hard to be alone\n\nAnd I'm [?] I know, sometimes\n\n\n\nJust take me with you when you go, go, go\n\nI know the things I said before, oh no\n\nDon't let it come between us\n\nJust hold on to the feeling\n\nWhen the distance starts to grow, grow, grow\n\nJust take me with you when you go",
