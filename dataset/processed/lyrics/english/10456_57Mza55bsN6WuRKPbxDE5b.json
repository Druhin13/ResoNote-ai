  "lyrics": "Baby, put that out\r\nI don't let nobody smoke in here\r\nYou sounded woke on the telephone\r\nBut faded you don't say much\r\nI think I wanna go somewhere\r\nI don't like the quiet, that's\n\nWhy you got invited\n\nAh fuck it, my ride's coming\n\n\n\nStreetlights on wet pavement\n\nCity shining twice\n\nLemme out kitty corner\n\nFrom The Paradise\n\nThey used to know me here\n\nHaven't used that name in years\n\nBeen a woman too long\n\nFor that song now\n\nI been lost and I found out\n\nHigh supply just drives your cost down\n\nThey don't want you involved\n\nJust want you around\n\nWalking in\n\nI gotta step over\n\nA pretty thing learning her\n\nHead on her own shoulder\n\nI don't ask\n\nIf she's alright\n\nCuz I think she'd lie tonight\n\nThat her ride's coming\n\n\n\nBad news on the television\n\nTwo-for-ones on everything\n\nDon't want no one talking to me\n\nI just watch the flat screen\n\nClosed captions pass\n\nLooks like gender's over\n\nRace came back\n\nFaith is a hammer with a\n\nBook for a handle\n\nAnd people in power can edit the past\n\nCan put your hands behind your back\n\nTo read you someone else's rights\n\nFirst the sirens then the lights\n\nThat looks like your ride\n\nYour ride's coming",
