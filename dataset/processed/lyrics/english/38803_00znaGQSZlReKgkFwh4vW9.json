  "lyrics": "I been walking, walking in the moonlight\r\nTripping in the starlight, Lord and I'm feeling down\r\nWalking in the shadows, sneaking down a side road\r\nCome early morning I'll be there on the edge of town\r\nI was a thinking, thinking 'bout a good thing\n\nThinking bout a sweet dream, in my honey's eyes\n\nAnd I was a sinking', feeling kind of lonesome\n\nCome early morning I'll be home at my honey's side\n\n\n\nCHORUS:\n\nI have drifted up across the mountain\n\nand I have stumbled down the other side\n\nAnd I've been tempted, tried and troubled\n\nCome early morning I'll be home and satisfied\n\n\n\nShe give me little loving, gives me little sunshine\n\nMakes me have a good time, Lord when I'm feeling' blue\n\nI couldn't refuse her, well I couldn't misuse her\n\nCome early morning I'll be home with my honey dew",
