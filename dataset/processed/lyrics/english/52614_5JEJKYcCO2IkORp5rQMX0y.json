  "lyrics": "My calendar says I don't have enough time\r\nI can't read my mind, no idea who am I\r\nI've seen the people kill themselves\r\nI've seen they lost inside their heads\r\nThis monster can grab anyone\r\nOnly the dream can help\n\n\n\nI run away for something more, I run away, please close the door\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI'm still the kid I used to be, dreaming is right up my street\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\n\n\nI gotta focus on the things really worth it\n\nAnd now all pain is gone, I gotta count on myself\n\nFirst day I couldn't believe it\n\nNext week I had to admit it\n\nLast couple days we've spent together\n\nBut nothing is forever\n\n\n\nI run away for something more, I run away, please close the door\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI'm still the kid I used to be, dreaming is right up my street\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\n\n\nСмотри мечтам в глаза, им есть что сказать\n\nИм есть что сказать\n\nСмотри мечтам в глаза, им есть что сказать\n\nСмотри мечтам в глаза, им есть что сказать\n\nСмотри мечтам в глаза, им есть что сказать\n\nСмотри мечтам в глаза\n\n\n\nI run away for something more, I run away, please close the door\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI'm still the kid I used to be, dreaming is right up my street\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away\n\nI don't need air when something takes my breath away",
