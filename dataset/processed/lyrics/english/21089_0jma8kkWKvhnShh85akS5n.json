  "lyrics": "I couldn't wait for the summer\r\nBut now I'm missing the spring\r\nAnd I exhausted the winter\r\nCraving what it couldn't bring\r\nPainting the world to be hopeless\r\nPainting it perfect and fine\n\nPut what I want on the canvas\n\nEvery color my design\n\nHow do I hold all of the discord?\n\nAll of my answers collide\n\nFighting for progress in quicksand\n\nThere's no truth between the pride\n\nNobody sees all the pieces\n\nTricky to balance a beast\n\nI am a pendulum swinging\n\nStill, I know You're holding me\n\n\n\nWhen the sky is falling, when life is a dream\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\nOnly God above me, painting my scene\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\n\n\nHey now, all the pressure on me got me\n\nWeighed down, nowadays I'm lookin' for a way out\n\nInstead of gettin' out what I'm supposed to\n\nThrough that situation God brought me closer\n\nIt ain't todo bien\n\nBut I do-so-doe with the pain\n\nAnd a dose of that is like soap\n\nIn an open wound to be cleaned\n\nGotta happen though it hurt\n\nGettin' better feelin' worse\n\nI'm just happy that I work\n\nStackin' bread instead of dirt\n\nI'm adjusting perspective\n\nWhat's an election?\n\nLove is a weapon\n\nTrust in a blessed\n\nHoles in my faith I hold em in tension\n\nMade a profession\n\nThat became my profession\n\nThe answer came in a question like\n\nIf it all fell apart would I trust in God?\n\nAnd if it's all good would I need him at all?\n\nThat's when I found that beauty in between\n\nIf you know that you don't know that much\n\nYou know just what I mean\n\n\n\nWhen the sky is falling, when life is a dream\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\nOnly God above me, painting my scene\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\n\n\nGive me water, lifted up\n\nTake my time to taste the cup\n\nRealize a different story\n\nFull of life and full of glory (full of glory)\n\nGive me water, lifted up (lifted up)\n\nTake my time to taste the cup (taste the cup)\n\nRealize a different story\n\nFull of life and full of glory (full of glory)\n\nGive me water, lifted up (lifted up)\n\nTake my time to taste the cup (taste the cup)\n\nRealize a different story\n\nFull of life and full of glory (full of glory)\n\n\n\nWhen the sky is falling, when life is a dream\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\nOnly God above me, painting my scene\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\n\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between\n\nI fortunately fall into the beauty between",
