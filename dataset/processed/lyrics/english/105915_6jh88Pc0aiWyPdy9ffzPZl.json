  "lyrics": "You're puttin' me together and tear me apart\r\nYou're always gonna be the other half of my heart\r\nI've been hard on myself, but don't say you're sorry\r\nJust say anything, I'm not ready for lonely\r\nTomorrow's always better than yesterday\n\nIt never comes too far away\n\nPain's always closer\n\n\n\nYou're puttin' me together and tear me apart\n\nYou promised me forever, and back to the start\n\nYour love leaves a mark, but never a scar\n\nYou're always gonna be the other half of my heart\n\n\n\nI wanna know what you feel, your face already told me\n\nBut it doesn't feel real if I don't hear your voice\n\n\n\nPuttin' me together and tear me apart\n\nYou promised me forever and back to the start\n\nYour love leaves a mark, but never a scar\n\nYou're always gonna be the other half of my heart\n\n\n\nYou're everything I ever wanted (Ever wanted, wanted)\n\nSomething deep inside me's always fought it (Fought it, fought it, fought it)\n\nSo I left it six feet down and just ignore it 'til it fades\n\n\n\nYou're puttin' me together and tear me apart\n\nYou're always gonna be the other half of my heart\n\n\n\nYou're puttin' me together and tear me apart\n\n(Puttin' me together and tear me apart)\n\nYou promised me forever and back to the start\n\n(Promised me forever and back to the start)\n\nYour love leaves a mark, but never a scar\n\n(Your love leaves a mark, but never a scar)\n\nYou're always gonna be the other half of my heart\n\n(Always gonna be) half of my heart\n\n\n\n(You're always gonna be the other half of my heart)\n\nHalf of my heart\n\n(You're always gonna be the other half of my heart)\n\nHalf of my heart",
