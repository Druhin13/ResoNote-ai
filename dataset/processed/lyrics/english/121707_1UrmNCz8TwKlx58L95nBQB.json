  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Distant par Tate McRae\r\nI stay away, cause there's a part of me\nKnowing that I need that space to be\nCreate my path into the unknown\nCircle and back into what means most\n\nI keep a distance, for my own purpose\nAnd I can tell you feel the same\nThe expectations and situations\nAre driving me insane\n\nAnd it don't matter cause I push right through\nDo you understand I'm just like you?\nAll the doubts that I have ever had\nWere never built to last, that's why were distant\n\nFor our own purpose\n\nThat's why were di- di- di-\nThat's why were distant\n\nIt's hard to know if these thoughts are true\nIf I'm drifting I'm shifting my point of view\nCause I've been told I need to separate\nGet away from the crowd and carve my way\n\nI keep a distance, for my own purpose\nAnd I can tell you feel the same\nThe expectations and situations\nAre driving me insane\n\nAnd it don't matter cause I push right through\nDo you understand I'm just like you?\nAll the doubts that I have ever had\nWere never built to last, that's why were distant\n\n\nFor our own purpose\nThat's why were di- di- di-\nThat's why were distant\n\nDistant\nDistant\nDistant\n(Distance)\n\nPurpose\nPurpose\nPurpose\n(Purpose)\n\nDistant\nDistant\nDistant\n(Distant)\n\nPurpose\n\nThat's why were distant\n(Distant) (distant)\nFor our own purpose\n(Purpose) (purpose)\n\nThat's why were di- di- di-\n(Distant)\n(Purpose)\nThat's why were distant\n\nFall out on purpose\nThat's why were di- di di-\n(Distant)\n(Distant)\n\nI keep a distance\n\nFor my own purpose\nThat's why were different",
