  "lyrics": "Not my momma, not my daddy, not my uncle but it's me, oh Lord\r\nLooking at me like I'm crazy and I'm crazy and it's me, oh Lord\r\nLike I'm stuck up in the Matrix and I'm feeling like I'm Neo, Lord\r\nStanding in the need of prayer\r\nStanding in the need of prayer\r\nHa\n\n\n\nLook, when I was young, I was dumb, then I got older\n\nI'm still dumb, the only difference is that now I know it\n\nWhen I'm a grumpy old man, I'ma love it\n\nI say all the things I really wanna say without the repercussions\n\nSome people push my buttons, say wild things in public\n\nThey like LeBron jumpin', I'm just supposed to rise above it\n\nI need strength to not act crazy, now please, Lord\n\nIt seem like everybody is a thug behind that keyboard\n\nUntil I find they IP addresses then hire a private investigator to find the place that they rest in\n\nShow up at they front door, calm and collected\n\nJust to test them to see if they bold as they was actin' in my comment section\n\nDrivin' down the one way in the wrong direction\n\nAll because I'm occupied with the Spotify and the song selection\n\nWifey sayin', \"Chill,\" she tryna take my phone\n\nJesus take the wheel, I'm tryna make it home\n\n\n\nNot my momma, not my daddy, not my uncle but it's me, oh Lord\n\nI don't wanna look crazy\n\nLooking at me like I'm crazy and I'm crazy and it's me, oh Lord\n\nI don't wanna look crazy\n\nLike I'm stuck up in the Matrix and I'm feeling like I'm me, oh Lord\n\nStanding in the need of prayer\n\nStanding in the need of prayer\n\nHa\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\nOh, oh, oh",
