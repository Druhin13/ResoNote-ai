  "lyrics": "I'm tired of sleeping on us\r\nI'm over dodging this crush\r\nI'm sick of waiting 10 minutes just to text you back\r\nSo you don't get to thinkin' that I'm too attached\r\nI'm more than benefit friends\r\nI'm more than just a weekend binge\n\nI want you to be my hottie riding shottie, I don't want nobody's body but your body, babe\n\nAll I'm tryna say is\n\n\n\nThere's a difference between \"miss ya\" and \"I miss your face\"\n\nAnd there's a difference in \"What's going on?\" and \"Baby, how was your day?\"\n\nYeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two\n\nAnd there's a difference in \"Love ya\" and \"I love you\"\n\nAnd I wanna be the difference, yeah I do\n\n\n\nI wanna be the difference between \"Hey, what's up?' and \"What are we gonna do tonight?\"\n\nBetween \"Yeah, she's cool, we hang out sometimes\" and \"That girl right there, she's mine\"\n\nBetween leading ya on and holdin' your hand\n\nSittin' it out and \"Girl, let's dance\"\n\nBetween playing it safe and taking the chance\n\nYeah, pumpin' the brakes and hittin' the gas\n\n\n\nThere's a difference between \"miss ya\" and \"I miss your face\"\n\nAnd there's a difference in \"What's going on?\" and \"Baby, how was your day?\"\n\nYeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two\n\nAnd there's a difference in \"Love ya\" and \"I love you\"\n\n\n\nAnd I wanna be the difference, close the distance\n\nAnd be that puzzle piece you didn't even know you was missing baby\n\nOhh, I wanna be the difference, yeah I do\n\n\n\nThere's a difference between \"miss ya\" and \"I miss your face\"\n\nAnd there's a difference in \"What's going on?\" and \"Baby, how was your day?\"\n\nYeah, there's a hell of a difference in saying three words or kinda just meaning two\n\nAnd there's a difference in \"Love ya\" and \"I love you\"\n\nAnd I wanna be the difference, oh yeah\n\nI wanna be the difference\n\nI wanna be the difference",
