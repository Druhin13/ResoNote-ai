  "lyrics": "Your hands are folded\r\nYour eyes are closing\r\nYour words are broken\r\nYour eyes are dry\r\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\n\n\nYou are your mother's child\n\nYou're a mother of a mother of a mother now\n\nRaised in the age of the milkman\n\nI can't claim to understand\n\n\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\n\n\nLord, prepare me\n\nFor the shadows\n\nFor the sparrows\n\nAt my window\n\nLord, have mercy\n\nOn my descendants\n\nFor they know not\n\nWhat they do\n\nFor they know not\n\nWho you are\n\nAnd they know not\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\nI, the anchor\n\nI'm slowly sinking\n\nInto darkness\n\nYet unknown\n\nBut the fading\n\nLight around me\n\nIs full of faces\n\nWho carry my name\n\n\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\n\n\nLord, be near me\n\nMy final hour\n\nI once had sight\n\nBut now I'm blind\n\nOh, I tried to be\n\nA second coming\n\nAnd if I want\n\nNobody knew\n\nIf my throat can't sing\n\nThen my soul\n\nScreams out to you!\n\n\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust\n\nI am weak looking at you\n\nA pillar of truth\n\nTurning to dust",
