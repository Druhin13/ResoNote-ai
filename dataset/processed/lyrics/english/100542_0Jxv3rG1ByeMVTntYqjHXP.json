  "lyrics": "Everyday the same routine\r\nOperating life machine\r\nOn and on we live this way\r\nWith no spontaneity\r\nWhat happened to the wild ones?\n\nNo sense of the hours\n\nWhat happened to the freedom?\n\nDid we get that back?\n\n\n\nSo we're going, going through the motions\n\nWe're just going, going through the motions\n\nWe used to live like waves in the oceans\n\nNow we're going, going through the motions\n\n\n\nWhat if I said 'let's run away'?\n\nA one way ticket to an exotic place\n\nDance and scream and shout in the pouring rain\n\nFind serenity in the great escape\n\n\n\nWhat happened to the wild ones?\n\nNo sense of the hours\n\nWhat happened to the freedom?\n\nCan we get that back?\n\n\n\n'Cause we're going, going through the motions\n\nWe're just going, going through the motions\n\nWe used to live like waves in the oceans\n\nNow we're going, going through the motions\n\n\n\n(I can't keep going, I can't keep going, I can't keep going\n\nI can't keep going, I can't keep going, I can't keep going)\n\nI can't, I can't, I can't\n\n\n\nSaid I can't keep going, going through the motions\n\nYou can't keep going, going through the motions\n\nWe used to live life with so much emotion\n\nCan't keep going, going through the motions",
