  "lyrics": "Hide your horses, hold your tongue\r\nHang the rich and spare the young\r\nWho drain the spirits from the jars\r\nHope the fences, steal the cars\r\nRun and fumes and from the north\r\nAnd burn for us right through the fall\n\n\n\nAll the ladies call your name\n\nBrush your hair like it could be tamed\n\nHitch their dresses past the knees\n\nSpilling to the floor like ease\n\nThey swing the bridges one and more\n\nAnd burn for us right through the fall\n\n\n\nAll our running, all our running\n\nAll our running, all our running\n\n\n\nAnd we'll seize the captain's wheel\n\nA mutiny we've come to feel\n\nWhen [?] their aiming's gone from view\n\nWith everything we thought to do\n\nOh, the devil won't have me\n\nI wonder who will, I wonder who will\n\nAll our running is a crawl\n\nAnd burns for us right through the fall\n\n\n\n\n\nAll our running, all our running\n\nAll our running, all our running\n\nAll our running, all our running\n\nAll our running, all our running\n\n\n\n(Gracias a Maicol Ugarte Gonzalez por esta letra)",
