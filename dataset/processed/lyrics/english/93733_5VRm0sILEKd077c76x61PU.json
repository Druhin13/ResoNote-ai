  "lyrics": "When you were young, there were some things\r\nYou had planned out, a map of your dreams\r\nIf some pull through, and if some fall away\r\nI promise to you, this one's gonna stay\r\nI'll sway like a tree when you need a change\n\nI'll travel the world or stay in one place\n\nI'll hold your hand when the storm's at the door\n\n'Cause you got my back and I got yours\n\n\n\nYou've got the love a good woman\n\nYeah, you've got the love a good woman\n\n\n\nIf you need my arms to hold you together\n\nThey'll be right here to hold you forever\n\nSometimes we won't know the road that we'll face\n\nBut we'll get where we're going even if we're late\n\n\n\nI'll sway like a tree when you need a change\n\nNo one'll speak the language we made\n\nI'll hold your hand when the storm's at the door\n\n'Cause you got my back and I got yours\n\n\n\nYou've got the love a good woman\n\nYeah, you've got the love a good woman\n\n\n\nI'll keep you warm beneath the sheets\n\nThe weight of the world's got nothing on me\n\n\n\nI'll sway like a tree when you need a change\n\nNo one'll speak the language we made\n\nI'll hold your hand when the storm's at the door\n\n'Cause you got my back and I got yours\n\n\n\n'Cause you've got the love a good woman\n\nYeah, you've got the love a good woman\n\nI'll sway like a tree when you need a change\n\nWe'll travel the world or stay in one place\n\nYou've got the love a good woman\n\nYeah, you've got the love a good woman",
