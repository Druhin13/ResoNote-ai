Where you been?\n\nWho you be with it? Who is that?\n\nWhich of them niggas is she with and which is yours?\n\nThen it clicks suddenly that you ain't gotta explain shit for me no more, me no more\n\n'Cause there ain't no us, there ain't no we no more\n\n'Got me broken down, got my knees on the floor\n\nMy head in my hands, shell of a man\n\n\n\nWhen we work, that's all gone\n\n'Cause I've been spending my days alone\n\nNow my home don't feel like\n\n'Cause I've been spending my days alone\n\nYou're still wifey in my phone\n\nBut I've been spending my days alone\n\nJust realised that I'm not that strong\n\nI've been spendin'\n\n\n\nI don't wanna spend another day without you, girl\n\nI don't wanna spend another day without you, girl\n\nI can't spend another with you in my head\n\n[??] night, ok\n\nI don't wanna spend another day without you, girl\n\nWithout you, girl\n\n\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you\n\nNot another day without you",
