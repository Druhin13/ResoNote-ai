  "lyrics": "Another west coast Saturday\r\nAnd the shore gives me a crash and it's gone\r\nJust like the midnight getaway\r\nWhen I ducked into a cabin, pushed on\r\nShe had a pretty face silhouette\r\nAnd she told me that she liked how I kissed\n\nWhat's the point, point anyway?\n\nDreaming of this\n\n\n\n'Cause it's gone, in the past\n\nBut we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nKnow our love didn't last\n\nBut we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nNo, I won't forget all the things she said\n\nAnd the way she looked at me that night\n\n'Cause it's stuck under glass\n\nYeah, we'll always be together in the photograph\n\n\n\nBooks on the bed frame, countertop\n\nShe had papers on the dresser and drawers\n\nStill hear her 'don't you ever stop'\n\nWe were laying in a room on the floor\n\nShe had a dark side underneath\n\nBut I never saw it peeking until\n\nSometimes she dances through my thoughts\n\nBut I know instead\n\n\n\nThat it's gone, in the past\n\nBut we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nKnow our love didn't last\n\nBut we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nNo, I won't forget all the things she said\n\nAnd the way she looked at me that night\n\n'Cause it's stuck under glass\n\nYeah, we'll always be together in the photograph\n\n\n\nShe's not the one, hey, woah\n\nBut I think about it now and then\n\nShe's not the one, hey, woah\n\nWhen I close my eyes I see her face\n\nBut still, I know she's not the one\n\nI think about it now and then\n\n\n\nBut it's gone, in the past\n\nBut we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nKnow our love didn't last\n\nBut we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nNo, I won't forget all the things she said\n\nAnd the way she looked at me that night\n\n'Cause it's stuck under glass\n\nYeah, we'll always be together in the photograph\n\nIt's better like that",
