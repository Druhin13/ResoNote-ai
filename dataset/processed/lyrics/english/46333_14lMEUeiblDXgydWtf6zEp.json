  "lyrics": "Somewhere over the rainbow way up high\r\nThere's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby\r\nSomewhere over a rainbow skies are blue\r\nAnd the dreams that you dare to dream\r\nReally do come true\r\nSome day I'll wish upon a star\n\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far behind me\n\nWhere troubles melt like lemon drops\n\nAway above the chimney tops\n\nThat's where you'll find me\n\nsomewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly\n\nBirds fly over the rainbow why then oh why can't I?\n\n\n\n*instrumental break for trumpet*\n\n\n\nSomeday I'll wish upon a star\n\nAnd wake up where the clouds are far behind me\n\nWhere troubles melt like lemon drops\n\nAway above the chimney tops\n\nThat's where you'll find me\n\nSomewhere over the rainbow blue birds fly\n\nBirds fly over the rainbow\n\nWhy then, oh why can't I?\n\nIf happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow\n\nWhy oh why can't I?",
