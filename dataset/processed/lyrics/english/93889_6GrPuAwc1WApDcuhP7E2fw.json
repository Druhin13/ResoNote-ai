  "lyrics": "(Come on)\r\nIt was clear I had to meet her from the first time she walked by\r\nSee, the second that I seen her, knew I had to make her mine\r\nAnd just a game of pool, a little shot on the stool\r\nAnd I already had her dead\r\nIt's down to business, ain't no sense in wasting time\n\n\n\nFeels like we're flyin' down the highway, spinnin' out sideways\n\nA hundred mile an hour we go\n\nTop down, fastback, NASCAR, short track\n\nBurnin' rubber down the road\n\nWell we're talkin' and we're touchin'\n\nAnd we're kissin' and we're lovin'\n\nYeah, we're kickin' up a cloud of dust\n\n'Cause girl, we're movin'\n\nMovin' at the speed of love\n\n\n\nYeah, this story's as real as the orange peel left on the ballroom floor\n\nWe meant every word of that \"Don't Disturb\" hangin' on the hotel door\n\n'Cause we was makin' out and we was knockin' boots\n\nAnd it was just last night we was introduced\n\nI guess time flies when you're movin' at the speed of love\n\n\n\nFeels like we're flyin' down the highway, spinnin' out sideways\n\nA hundred mile an hour we go\n\nTop down, fastback, NASCAR, short track\n\nBurnin' rubber down the road\n\nWell we're talkin' and we're touchin'\n\nAnd we're kissin' and we're lovin'\n\nYeah, we're kickin' up a cloud of dust\n\n'Cause girl, we're movin'\n\nMovin' at the speed of love\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, we got off tour and I ran to the store just to check out a diamond ring\n\nGot a girl, she gorgeous, yeah, that's who this is for\n\nAnd it's only been a couple weeks\n\n\n\nFeels like we're flyin' down the highway, spinnin' out sideways\n\nA hundred mile an hour we go\n\nTop down, fastback, NASCAR, short track\n\nBurnin' rubber down the road\n\nWell we're talkin' and we're touchin'\n\nAnd we're kissin' and we're lovin'\n\nYeah, we're kickin' up a cloud of dust\n\n'Cause girl, we're movin'\n\nMovin' at the speed of love\n\n\n\nWe can't stop movin'\n\nMovin' at the speed of love\n\n(That's right\n\nCome on now\n\nKeep up)",
