  "lyrics": "I prayed that the light in me to not only be held inside of me\r\nBut free the wrong with the right in me\r\nBecause the demon I was, they won't confide in me\r\nI come from a religious background\r\nBeing raised a Christian of Barker Temple Church of God and Christ\r\nAlso studying Islam from 12-17 after my Christian mother married a Muslim\r\nMom loved that I rapped, she wanted me to do it for Christ\r\nBut the worldly me began when I ran away from home at 17\r\nAnd no matter how much better of a person I became\r\nThe worldly things I did would catch up with me\r\nAnd try to pull me right back down\r\nRight back down\r\nRight back down\r\nRight back down\r\nRight back down",
