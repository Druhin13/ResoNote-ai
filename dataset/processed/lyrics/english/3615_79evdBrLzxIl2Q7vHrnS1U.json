  "lyrics": "Just a little [?] I wrote while flyin' high in the sky\r\nSomebody gotta say something, that somebody's gonna be me\r\nPeople rather have separation than to come together living freely\r\nAll the tragedies we see on the dark streets and the TV\r\nMake it difficult to grow a glee tree when the love level back in B.C\n\nWe will never see racism done away with on our lifetime\n\nWhen the parents hearts full of hate reproduce, then it's sent down the pipeline\n\nIf their kids want to fight crime, and they talk to others of the right kind\n\nThat'd be terrifying facing nighttime and it still is the only light shined\n\nJesus not present when things seem so egregious\n\nBut if we just set aside all our differences and try to ease up\n\nOff of war with each other please trust we can be just\n\nWhen the hating, killings enough and the anthem will have everybody taking knees up\n\n\n\nNo, we won't go quietly\n\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\n\nWe said \"Turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\"\n\nBut we won't go quietly\n\nAnd everybody said\n\nNo we won't go quietly\n\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\n\nWe said \"Turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\"\n\nBut we won't go quietly\n\n\n\nYo, too many people of power afraid to say things\n\n'Cause they don't want consumers to stop their pay streams\n\nIf they don't agree with your way of thinking they taking\n\nYour cake cream, no love no life is all that hate brings\n\nI stand by love so if this don't enhance my buzz\n\nAnd the fans die and my blood, the world is ran by thugs\n\nThat just want to ban my blood that runs with an angel flow\n\nWhat they bleed ought to be equality, never been the angle though\n\nBut one day soon I wanna look and see the people loving then say \"Bravo\"\n\nCause now I see a lot of killing and fighting like Rocky and Ivan Drago\n\nAll good to be in Cabo, I'm rolling in your mercy alago\n\nBut we just say a prayer if you will to stop the ill drills off up in Chicago\n\nPlease\n\n\n\nNo, we won't go quietly\n\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\n\nWe said \"Turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\"\n\nBut we won't go quietly now\n\nNo we won't go quietly\n\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\n\nWe said \"Turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\"\n\nBut we won't go quietly\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nWishing we could be rid of all terrorism\n\nLike it's their \"ism\", for the good I'd say heroism\n\nWe are the dauntless in the midst of demons we see in swarms\n\nSo mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed\n\nI learned to love from my mother\n\nI feel an angel around me, I know she hovers\n\nImpatiently waiting for you to discover that people all need each other\n\nWhen you see me, I'll call you brother\n\nNever mattered whatever color\n\n\n\nNo, we won't go quietly\n\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\n\nWe said \"Turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\"\n\nBut we won't go quietly\n\nAnd everybody said\n\nNo we won't go quietly\n\nAll the fear I've got inside will die with me\n\nWe said \"Turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed\"\n\nBut we won't go quietly\n\nAnd everybody said\n\nNo we won't go quietly\n\nAnd everybody said\n\nNo we won't go quietly\n\nNo we won't go quietly\n\n\n\nIf we didn't fear each other, we could stand near each other\n\nStrange Music\n\nYa Bwi!",
