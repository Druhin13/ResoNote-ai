(You're dead to me)\n\nTakes all (you're dead to me)\n\n(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)\n\nYou know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)\n\nDon't care who you with (you're dead to me)\n\nWatch me do my shit (you're dead to me)\n\n(You're dead to me)\n\n\n\nHey hey\n\nReady, set, go crazy\n\nHere to finesse, you see I'm getting mines\n\nLife hit a nigga with a lemon's lime\n\nLike what at night we still committing crimes, spitting rhymes\n\nBought a coupe with the spinning rims, get inside\n\nBring a friend, bleeding hands from the genocide\n\nClean me up, beam me up to the other side\n\nBrothers die, 'cause coons turn to butterflies\n\nThey don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz\n\nThey don't wanna see me livin' on the end\n\nOf the city in a citywide bend\n\nShow no pity in the city full of sin\n\nThey don't wanna see me gettin' to the check\n\nThey just wanna see me swimming in the debt\n\nDon't drown on ground wait until you hear\n\n911, freeze (zoom zoom) dead\n\n\n\nOpps on the radar (you're dead to me)\n\nHow you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)\n\nTakes all (you're dead to me)\n\n(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)\n\nYou know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)\n\nDon't care who you with (you're dead to me)\n\nWatch me do my shit (you're dead to me)\n\n(You're dead to me)\n\n\n\nI move like a millipede\n\nWhen I flex them tendons like rubber trees\n\nYoung Millie Jackson back to the shit\n\nMouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory\n\nStack bodies, not figurines\n\nMove beneath the surface, submarine\n\nI'm half machine, obscene with a light sword\n\nLook inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward\n\nWhat you standing on the side for?\n\nRoar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg\n\nSpit slick, attack is subliminal\n\nFlowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister\n\nStand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal\n\nGotham city streets I'll blame the\n\nCrushing any system, that belittles us\n\nAntidote to every poison they administer\n\nSwitch it like time signatures\n\nColours in my aura tend cover the perimeter\n\nBrown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through\n\nHi-rez lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)\n\nRoll over your eyes\n\nMy strength ain't nothing like my size\n\nBlades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver\n\nTangle my chords like a weaver\n\n\n\nOpps on the radar (you're dead to me)\n\nHow you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)\n\nTakes all (you're dead to me)\n\n(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)\n\nYou know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)\n\nDon't care who you with (you're dead to me)\n\nWatch me do my shit (you're dead to me)\n\n(You're dead to me)",
