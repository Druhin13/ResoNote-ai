  "lyrics": "I am sick of being not alright\r\nI've been like this all the time\r\nI've been like this all the time\r\nKiss your feelings all goodbye\r\nSomeday you're gonna die\r\nSomeday we're all going to die\n\nBut not tonight\n\n\n\nShed a little light\n\nYou were everything, you were everything\n\nI cared a little too much, I cared a little too much\n\nLock the doors swallow the key\n\nYou were everything\n\nI cared a little too much, I cared a little too much\n\nYou said this was it and I believed it\n\n\n\nI did, I did, I believed it all\n\nI did, I did, every word I thought\n\n\n\nOur hearts would combust\n\nLovers with our luck\n\nYou said this was it and I believed it\n\nI believed\n\n\n\nWould you care if I changed?\n\nWould you care?\n\n\n\nEvery oar will mold\n\nPlus these rain clouds can't cry enough to make it stay afloat\n\nI think you wish I wasn't around anymore\n\nI think you wish I passed in a crash of some sort\n\n\n\nThe highest rising moment of us was a blur\n\nYou cried, we drowned, as I thought we danced on the shore\n\n\n\nI think you wish I wasn't around anymore\n\nI think you wish I passed in a crash of some sort\n\nI think you wish I wasn't around anymore\n\nI think you wish I passed in a crash",
