  "lyrics": "A moving stream of information\r\nThat is floating on the wind\r\nThe secrets never end\r\nAnd now they call,\r\nThey sing, they play, they dance\r\nFor you, from out of the blue,\n\nWhat can you do?\n\n\n\nChorus: the secret messages are calling to me endlessly\n\nThey call to me across the air\n\nThe messages across the atmosphere\n\nThey whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere\n\n\n\nWhere words cascade like rainbows tumbling from the sky\n\nThen I'll be there, I'll be there\n\nWhen messages will call to you their secrets all around\n\nWithout a sound, they're all around\n\n\n\nChorus\n\n\n\nThose secret messages that spill into the air from far away\n\nSo far away\n\nA flowing river of illusion running with confusion\n\nNever gone - it goes on and on\n\n\n\nChorus",
