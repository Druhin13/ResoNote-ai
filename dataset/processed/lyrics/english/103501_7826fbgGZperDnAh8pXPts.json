  "lyrics": "She's wrapped in a blanket, Sunday morning\r\nHurting and working on a Pedialyte\r\nMissed the church bell, asking herself\r\n\"Girl, what the hell did you do last night?\"\r\n'Cause was one text led to her ex's bed and clothes all over the place\r\nShe was summa cum laude, but at 1 am that wasn't the case\n\n\n\nDrunk people do dumb things\n\nThey pick it up when the phone rings\n\nSaying things that they don't mean\n\nLike \"I want you back, the key's under the mat\"\n\nYeah, they forget about the heartbreak\n\nNever thinking 'bout the next day\n\nTil it's too late, you can't take it back now\n\nBut it's okay, don't let it get you down\n\nDrunk people do dumb things\n\n\n\nHe's standing in the shower thinking about her\n\nConsidering drinking a bounce back beer\n\nSaying why did I get drunk, mad 'cuz he slipped up\n\n'Cause getting over her took all last year\n\nNow he's all torn up wishing she'd come back\n\nHe thought he was smarter than that\n\n\n\nBut drunk people do dumb things\n\nThey pick it up when the phone rings\n\nSaying things that they don't mean\n\nLike \"I want you back, the key's under the mat\"\n\nYeah, they forget about the heartbreak\n\nNever thinking 'bout the next day\n\nTil it's too late, you can't take it back now\n\nBut it's okay, don't let it get you down\n\nDrunk people do dumb things\n\nOh, drunk people do dumb things\n\n\n\nHey, you up?\n\nYeah, what's up?\n\nIt's been a while, I miss you\n\nI miss you too\n\nSemi colon smile\n\nWhat you doing right now, can I come meet you?\n\nDrop me a pin, be there in ten\n\n\n\nDrunk people do dumb things\n\nThey pick it up when the phone rings\n\nSaying things that they don't mean\n\nLike \"I want you back, the key's under the mat\"\n\nYeah, they forget about the heartbreak\n\nNever thinking 'bout the next day\n\nTil it's too late, you can't take it back now\n\nBut it's okay, don't let it get you down\n\nDrunk people do dumb things\n\nOh, drunk people do dumb things",
