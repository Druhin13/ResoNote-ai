  "lyrics": "Warm my baby from my breast\r\nNow my name and rank cover my chest\r\nTwenty-three hours I flew and wept\r\nTwenty-three hours I never slept\r\nWiped my face, changed my soaking bra, told my body not to feel at all tried to be like you what must I do to prove that I'm a brother too?\n\nI thought RPGs were fireworks, that's how green I was at first Blood blistered feet, black and blue\n\nI slid inside my blood filled boots\n\nSeventy-pound pack plus you on my back\n\nSpilled my blood on the road, man I carried my load\n\nKept you in my view, I'd die for you\n\nDon't that make me a brother too?\n\n\n\nIt's okay to cry, that's what you say\n\nBut if I do I'm damned anyway\n\nI learned to cry without a sound\n\nCause I'm afraid you'll put me down\n\n\n\nYou broke my heart on veterans day\n\nDon't you understand the words you say\n\nYou raised a flag for the men you serve\n\nWhat about the women, what do we deserve?\n\n\n\nI was just like you when the bullets flew\n\nI had your back you had mine too\n\nBrothers in arms, your sisters covered you\n\nDon't that make us your brother too?\n\n\n\nSay it for me, say it for you\n\nYour sisters are your brothers too",
