  "lyrics": "Wait a minute man \nYou mispronounced my name \nYou didn't wait for all the information \nBefore you turned me away \nWait a minute sir \n\nYou kind of hurt my feelings \n\nYou see me as a sweet back-loaded puppet \n\nAnd you've got a meal ticket taste \n\n\n\nI see right through you \n\nI know right through you \n\nI feel right through you \n\nI walk right through you \n\n\n\nYou took me for a joke \n\nYou took me for a child \n\nYou took a long hard look at my ass \n\nAnd then played golf for a while \n\n\n\nYour shake is like a fish \n\nYou pat me on the head \n\nYou took me out to wine dine sixty nine \n\nBut didn't hear a damn word I said \n\n\n\nI see right through you \n\nI know right through you \n\nI feel right through you \n\nI walk right through you \n\n\n\nHello Mr. Man \n\nYou didn't think that I'd come back \n\nYou didn't think I'd show up with my army \n\nAnd this ammunition on my back \n\n\n\nNow that I'm Miss Thing \n\nNow that I'm a zillionaire \n\nYou scan the credits for your name \n\nAnd wonder why it's not there \n\n\n\nI see right through you \n\nI know right through you \n\nI feel right through you \n\nI walk right through you, you",
