  "lyrics": "I wanna write a song\r\nOne that can explain my loss\r\nI wanna write a song\r\nThat you can hear and\r\nKnow how my heart yearns\n\nAnd how my insides churn\n\nAnd how my cheeks burn\n\nFrom the weekly storm\n\nAnd how my face turns\n\nBefore you return to the wall\n\nAnd then down the floor\n\n\n\nI keep only seeing rain\n\nI will say no\n\nBut you keep crawling in my brain\n\nI wanna get lost, run away\n\nIn the dark is where I will stray\n\n\n\nI gotta write a song\n\nBut I wanna feel my words\n\nAnd I keep getting it all wrong\n\nThink it out, write it out, rip it out\n\nThrow it all to the wall\n\n\n\nAnd I keep only seeing rain\n\nI will say no\n\nBut you keep crawling in my brain\n\nI wanna get lost, run away\n\nIn the dark is where I\n\n\n\nI wanna feel the way I used to\n\nI wanna move the way I used to groove\n\nI wanna feel the way I used to\n\nI wanna move the way I used to groove\n\n\n\nBut I keep only seeing rain\n\nI'll keep saying no\n\nBut you'll find your way into my brain\n\nI wanna get lost, run away\n\nIn the dark is where I\n\n\n\nI keep only seeing rain\n\nI will say no\n\nBut you keep crawling in my brain\n\nI wanna get lost, run away\n\nIn the dark is where I'll stray\n\n\n\nWanna feel the way I used to\n\nI wanna move the way I used to groove\n\nI wanna feel the way I used to\n\nI wanna feel the way I used to",
