  "lyrics": "(Written By: Laudir de Oliveira & Marcos Valle)\r\nWhy do we have to go and face the same routine\r\nAnd the traffic jams and crowded street's a real\r\nNeurotic scene\r\nI don't know, why do we take it each day, yeah\n\nWhy does my girl tell me she's got to\n\nHave her way\n\nOut all night, come home to fight\n\nWhat am I to say\n\nI don't know, why do we take it each day\n\nLife is what it is\n\nWho wants to try not to believe\n\nThat's the way it is\n\nOh, oh\n\nI don't know why what you feel inside\n\nDays go on\n\nLove is something that you just can't hide\n\nIf it's wrong\n\nThen you'll want to know, you don't know why\n\nI sing a song\n\nAnd it helps me yet I'll get by\n\nAt times\n\nLost in time sometimes your mind unwinds\n\nSun does shine\n\nBut no pleasure from your beauty's mine\n\nLike champagne wine\n\nA bitter taste that's so refined\n\nLife it's fine\n\nYou always pay for what's behind\n\nWhy do I have to go and face the same routine\n\nAnd the traffic jams and crowded street's a real\n\nNeurotic scene\n\nI don't know, why do we take it each day, yeah\n\nLife is what it is\n\nWho wants to try not to believe\n\nThat's the way it is",
