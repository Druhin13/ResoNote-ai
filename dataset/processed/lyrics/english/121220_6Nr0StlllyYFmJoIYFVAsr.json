Wish on a butterfly wing\n\nTake that crown, put it on that king\n\nSing like a child - no care for opinion\n\nReal love across our dominion\n\nOh so bountiful!\n\nPull it back and let it go\n\nLike ocean wave, we're powerful\n\nConstellation, magical\n\n\n\nSo, this love still holds true\n\nNow what you gonna do?\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nBetween the moon and sun\n\nThis life is never done\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nSend up send up send up my love\n\nI won't give up on you\n\n\n\nI stand up, gotta put my hands up\n\nFruit down straw like [?] Mount Akaya\n\nIn the ocean, holy motion\n\nRide that flow - I'll see you later\n\nIn the park of Shangri-la I see my ma\n\nShe's standing holy, all those colors filled with glory\n\nOpen up and hear this story:\n\n\n\nOh, this love still holds true\n\nNow what you gonna do?\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nBetween the moon and sun\n\nThis life is never done\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nThis love still holds true\n\nNow what you gonna do?\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nBetween the moon and sun\n\nThis life is never done\n\nI won't give up on you\n\nI won't give up on you\n\n\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow, follow, follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow, follow, follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow, follow, follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow, follow, follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow, follow, follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow you\n\nI will follow, follow, follow you\n\n\n\nI will follow you",
