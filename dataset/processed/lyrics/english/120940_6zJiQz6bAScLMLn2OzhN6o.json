  "lyrics": "Just a young one with a quick fuse\r\nI was uptight, wanna let loose\r\nI was dreaming of bigger things\r\nAnd wanna leave my old life behind\r\nNot a yes sir, not a follower\r\nFit the box, fit the mold\n\nHave a seat in the foyer, take a number\n\nI was lightning before the thunder\n\n\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder\n\nThunder, thunder\n\nThunder\n\n\n\nKids were laughing in my classes\n\nWhile I was scheming for the masses\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nDreaming 'bout being a big star\n\nThey say you're basic, they say you're easy\n\nYou're always riding in the backseat\n\nNow I'm smiling from the stage\n\nWhile you were clapping in the nose bleeds\n\n\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder\n\nThunder\n\n\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder, thunder\n\n\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder, thunder\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder, thunder\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder, thunder\n\nThunder, feel the thunder\n\nLightning then the thunder, thunder",
