  "lyrics": "Oh say, little dogies, why don't you lay down?\r\nYou've wandered and trampled all over the ground\r\nLay down, little dogies, lay down\r\nI've cross-herded, circle-herded, trail-herded too\r\nBut to keep you together, that's what I can't do\n\nBunch up, little dogies, bunch up\n\n\n\nMy horse is leg-weary and I'm awful tired\n\nBut if I let you get away I'm sure to get fired\n\nBunch up, little dogies, bunch up",
