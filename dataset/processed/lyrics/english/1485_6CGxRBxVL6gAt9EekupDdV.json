  "lyrics": "What's going on here?\r\nI thought it was strong\r\nClearly I was not in the know\r\nMind always running around\r\nI knew my downfall\r\nWhen I received that phone call\n\nAnd I just can't let it go\n\nCan't let it go\n\n\n\nMove to the beat to the beat don't stop\n\nI don't wanna play bad cop\n\nDon't wanna see the signs\n\nI don't wanna read between the lines\n\nMove to the beat to the beat don't stop\n\nI can't take that shot\n\nYou said you said you said\n\n\n\nI’d always be the last to know\n\n\n\nI'm finished at the start now\n\nYou said 'play your part'\n\nHow am I supposed to play the role\n\nWhen I'm always playing the fool\n\nReturn to sender\n\nColder than December\n\nBut I just can't let it show\n\nCan't let it show\n\n\n\nI don’t want to be the last to know",
