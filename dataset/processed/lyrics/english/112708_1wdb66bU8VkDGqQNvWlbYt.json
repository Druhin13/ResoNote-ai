  "lyrics": "Only you, you, you\r\nOnly you, you, you\r\nI remember in the schoolyard\r\nThe children didn't understand\r\nSo they bullied me with silence\r\nJust for being who I am\n\nSo I got good at keeping secrets\n\nI used to blend in with the crowd\n\nOn the inside I was screaming\n\nWith you I didn't have to hide\n\n\n\nOnly you, could see that I was hurting\n\nOnly you, ever cared to understand\n\nAlways know, that I'd do do the same\n\nI'd do anything for you, my friend\n\nIt's true\n\n\n\nI used to stare up at the ceiling\n\nWide awake all through the night\n\nWhile the world was busy sleeping\n\nI was so caught up in my mind\n\n\n\nOnly you, could see that I was hurting\n\nOnly you, ever cared to understand\n\nAlways know, that I'd do the same\n\nI'd do anything for you, my friend\n\nIt's true, so true\n\n\n\nOh, when I'm all alone\n\nA million miles away from home\n\nYou're still with me, you'll always be\n\nMy rock and shoulder to lean on\n\nWhen every hope I have is gone\n\nI'll turn to you, you know it's true\n\n\n\nOnly you, could see that I was hurting\n\nOnly you, ever cared to understand\n\nAlways know, that I'd do the same\n\nI'd do anything for you, my friend\n\nIt's true, so true\n\n\n\nAnd I know, 'til the bitter end\n\nI'll be proud to call you, my best friend\n\nIt's true, so true",
