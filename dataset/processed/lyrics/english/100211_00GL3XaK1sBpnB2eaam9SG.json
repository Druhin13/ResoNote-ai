  "lyrics": "Take a walk in a ghost town\r\nThe sky's as black as crows\r\nThey don't make cars like they used to here\r\nTimes, they change\r\nAnd factories close\n\nTake a ride on a ghost train\n\nAnd stare at the windows\n\nSee time moves fast as a hurricane\n\nBut it's so strange\n\nIt feels so slow\n\n\n\nWell sometimes it gets so cold down here\n\nWhere I swear it burns\n\nThe wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes\n\nSometimes it gets so dark in here\n\nHey I see it turn\n\nThe emptiness that moves within my soul\n\nWe [?] in a ghost town\n\n\n\nSee the crash in the rust\n\nSee the ash in the dust\n\nFear slipping through your hands\n\nWe're falling on the shoes and the shoulders\n\nWith the ragged man\n\n\n\nYou see the pride and the shame\n\nLike fire and the flame\n\nWell it burns through every mind\n\nAnd drops them like drunken soldiers\n\nOn the riverbanks\n\n\n\nWell sometimes it gets so cold down here\n\nHere I swear it burns\n\nThe wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes\n\nSometimes it gets so dark in here\n\nWhere I see it turn\n\nThe emptiness that moves within my soul\n\nWe [?] in a ghost town\n\n\n\nYeah sometimes it gets so cold down here\n\nHey I swear it burns\n\nThe wind like fire coming off of the Great Lakes\n\nSometimes it gets so dark in here\n\nOh I see it turn\n\nThe emptiness that moves within my soul\n\nWe [?] in a ghost town",
