Not me\n\nWho came to kiss and hug? Not me\n\nWho came to beat it up? Rocky\n\nAnd Imma use those hands to put up that gate and stop me\n\n\n\nWhen we fuck\n\nWhen we fuck\n\nWhen we fuck\n\nWhen we fuck\n\nI could be aggressive (I could be aggressive)\n\nI can be a savage (I can be a savage)\n\nI just need your blessin (I just need your blessin)\n\nSay that I can have it, yeah\n\nWhen we fuck\n\nWhen we fuck\n\n\n\nYou love it when I lose it\n\nYou love it when I go there\n\nYou love the way I use it\n\nYou love that I don't play fair\n\nYou end up callin me master (master)\n\nSay this universe is mine\n\nWhen we're done it's a disaster\n\nEnd up like this every time\n\n\n\nWho came to make sweet love? Not me\n\nWho came to kiss and hug? Not me\n\nWho came to beat it up?
