My young niggas traffic that\n\nMy satisfaction came from trappin' way before a platinum plaque\n\nMy homie pull up on that rat-tat-at, you know we set him flat\n\nThat's a fact, you nigga hit him for half-a-rack\n\nAll he wanted was an onion and a shoutout on the Snap (ha)\n\nI approach your hoe like, \"Bitch, lie down on your back\" (Bitch, lie down)\n\nWhen approach a king you got to bow down to the mack (bow down to the mack)\n\nI got to stack of racks that's underneath my mattress flat\n\nRoll a pound back to back, I grab the seal and crack the Act', bitch\n\nYou know my life a movie, every scene be action packed\n\nI fill a Bentley truck with groupies and I make 'em cab it back\n\nI think them crackas tryna scoop me, switch the line, they had a 'ttack\n\nI ain't havin' that, they tryna intercept my Cali pack\n\nI'm goin' Optimus Prime (transformers), I turn that rock into diams\n\nNiggas still gettin' murdered so the crime stoppers ain't stoppin' the crimes\n\nNah, I ain't being nervous, it's just on point, I got a lot on my mind\n\nLook at my closet it's high and how it's designed (yeah)\n\nI only cop it if top of the line, bitch",
