  "lyrics": "Captured effortlessly \nThat's the way it was \nHappened so naturally \nI did not know it was love \nThe next thing I felt was You \nholding me close \n\nWhat was I gonna do? \n\nI let myself go \n\n\n\nAnd now we're flyin' through the stars\n\nI hope this night will last forever \n\n\n\nI've been waitin' for you \n\nIt's been so long \n\nI knew just what I would do \n\nWhen I heard your song \n\nFilled my heart with your bliss \n\nGave me freedom \n\nYou knew I could not resist \n\nI needed someone \n\n\n\nAnd now we're flyin' through the stars \n\nI hope this night will last forever \n\nOh oh oh oh \n\n\n\nAin't nobody \n\nLoves me better \n\nMakes me happy \n\nMakes me feel this way \n\nAin't nobody \n\nLoves me better than you \n\n\n\nI wait for night time to come \n\nAnd bring you to me \n\nCan't believe I'm the one \n\nI was so lonely \n\nI feel like no one could feel \n\nI must be dreamin' \n\nI want this dream to be real \n\nI need this feelin' \n\n\n\nI make my wish upon a star \n\nAnd hope this night will last forever \n\n\n\nAin't nobody \n\nLoves me better \n\nMakes me happy \n\nMakes me feel this way \n\nAin't nobody \n\nLoves me better than you \n\n\n\nAnd first you put your arms around me \n\nThen you put your charms around me \n\nI can't resist this sweet surrender \n\nOh my nights are warm and tender \n\nWe stare into each other's eyes \n\nAnd what we see is no surprise \n\nGot a feeling most with treasure \n\nAnd a love so deep we cannot measure \n\n\n\nAin't nobody \n\nLoves me better \n\nMakes me happy \n\nMakes me feel this way \n\nAin't nobody \n\nLoves me better than you",
