  "lyrics": "Many nights have I heard her voice\r\nWhisper my name without making a noise\r\nCalling out from a pure, black void\r\nTears of sorrow or tears of joy\r\nDrops in my cup as my mind is destroyed\n\nStaring into a pure, black void\n\n\n\nSo what if I'm living out past the edge?\n\nSo what if I never come back again?\n\n\n\nMany evils have I enjoyed\n\nProwling the night raising hell with the boys\n\nGetting high on a pure, black void\n\n\n\nI am only a nameless soul\n\nHeading into a pure, black void\n\n\n\nSo what if I'm living out past the edge?\n\nSo what if I never come back again?\n\n\n\nWhere can you go when it’s all in your head?\n\nThese are the last words that I ever said\n\nWhere can you go when it’s all in your head?\n\n\n\nI am only a nameless soul\n\nHeading into a pure, black void\n\nI am only a nameless soul\n\nHeading into a pure, black void",
