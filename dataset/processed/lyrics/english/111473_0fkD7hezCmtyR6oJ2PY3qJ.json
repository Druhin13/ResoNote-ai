  "lyrics": "On a razor's edge\r\nAt the first sign of light\r\nThe car was packed\r\nWhile the house was quiet\r\nAnd my sister slept\r\nAs we started the drive\n\nTo California\n\nWhere it's warmer\n\nGonna start a new life\n\n\n\nGonna miss Ohio but this time\n\nWe're gonna get it right\n\n\n\nStation wagon tires, flying\n\nKatie's counting crows through the\n\nTears in her blue eyes\n\nState lines and capitals go rushing\n\nBy as, I'm trying to find\n\nA station on the radio\n\nEverything's gonna be better on the west coast\n\n\n\nAnd the days move fast\n\nOn northern plains\n\nAnd I read the maps\n\nThe prairie grass moved\n\nIn the wind like waves\n\nAnd we can't look back\n\nSome men you just can't save\n\nWe had our reasons, for leaving\n\nIt's better this way\n\n\n\nI'm gonna miss Ohio but not\n\nGonna miss rain\n\n\n\nStation wagon tires, flying\n\nKatie's counting crows through the\n\nTears in her blue eyes\n\nState lines and capitals go rushing\n\nBy as, I'm trying to find\n\nA station on the radio\n\nEverything's gonna be better on the west coast\n\nBetter than the mess that we left back home\n\nIn Ohio\n\nOhio\n\n\n\nGoodbye blue house\n\nGoodbye red door\n\nAbandon worlds where we would drink all we can\n\nThere's magnet's pulling from the ocean floor\n\nI can't forget\n\nThe way you looked when we were leaving\n\n\n\nTires, flying\n\nKatie's counting crows through the\n\nTears in her blue eyes\n\nState lines and capitals go rushing\n\nBy as, I'm trying to find\n\nA station on the radio\n\nEverything's gonna be better on the west coast\n\nBetter than the mess that we left back home\n\nIn Ohio\n\nOhio\n\nOhio\n\nOhio\n\nOhio",
