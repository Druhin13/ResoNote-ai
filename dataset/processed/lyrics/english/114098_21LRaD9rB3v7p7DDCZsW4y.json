  "lyrics": "It's got a touch of the town where I grew up\r\nSomething in it them California girls love\r\nSome people like to make a little fun of\r\nThe way I talk\r\nIt gets slower after three or four cold beers\r\nAnd gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers\n\nFolks know I'm country, when they hear\n\nThe way I talk\n\n\n\nIt sounds a little bit like my daddy\n\nIt don't cuss around my mama\n\nGot some words you've never heard of\n\n'Less you come from down yonder\n\nThe man upstairs gets it\n\nSo I ain't tryna fix it\n\nNo I can't hide it\n\nI don't fight it, I just roll with it\n\nOh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls\n\nIt's the only way I know\n\nMan it ain't my fault\n\nI just live the way I talk\n\n\n\nYeah it's, \"Yessir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now\"\n\nFighting words if you run my last name down\n\nI ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud\n\nOf the way I talk, y'all\n\n\n\nIt sounds a little bit like my daddy\n\nIt don't cuss around my mama\n\nGot some words you've never heard of\n\n'Less you come from down yonder\n\nThe man upstairs gets it\n\nSo I ain't tryna fix it\n\nNo I can't hide it\n\nI don't fight it, I just roll with it\n\nOh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls\n\nIt's the only way I know\n\nMan it ain't my fault\n\nI just live the way I talk\n\n\n\nSlow, like a Sunday morning service back home\n\nAnd kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on\n\nIf you know me, you know\n\n\n\nI sound a little bit like my daddy\n\nI don't cuss around my mama\n\nGot some words you've never heard of\n\n'Less you come from down yonder\n\nThe man upstairs gets it\n\nSo I ain't tryna fix it\n\nNo I can't hide it\n\nI don't fight it, I just roll with it\n\nOh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls\n\nIt's the only way I know\n\nMan it ain't my fault\n\nI just live the way I talk\n\nThe way I talk",
