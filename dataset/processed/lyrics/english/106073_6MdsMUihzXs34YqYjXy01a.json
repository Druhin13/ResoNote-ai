  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Say You Love Me par Seeb\r\nI can tell you think that you're a little important\nYou really are, you really are\nThat doesn't really matter if your heart is in torment\nIt's a trivial, be honest\n\nCan you shed some light\nLet me in tonight\nI've been out here in the cold\nCan you take my hand\nHelp me understand\nCause I'm leaving if you don't\n\nSay you love me, love me\nSay you love me, love me\n\nI'm so tired of saying it alone\nSay you love me, love me\nIf you love me, love me\nCause it hurts to say it alone\n\nLet me in, let me in, let me in\nLet me in, let me in, let me in\n\nYou can be a dick but I can never deny it\nYou're brilliant, you're brilliant\nThe problem that I have is that you're constantly hiding\nYour feelings, so let's be honest\n\nCan you shed some light\nLet me in tonight\nI've been out here in the cold\nCan you take my hand\n\nHelp me understand\nCause I'm leaving if you don't\n\nSay you love me, love me\nSay you love me, love me\nI'm so tired of saying it alone\nSay you love me, love me\nIf you love me, love me\nCause it hurts to say it alone\n\nLet me in, let me in, let me in\nLet me in, let me in, let me in\n\nCan you shed some light\nLet me in tonight\nI've been out here in the cold\nCan you take my hand\nHelp me understand\n\nCause I'm leaving if you don't\n\nLet me in, let me in",
