  "lyrics": "Had a thought that consumer goods were bad\r\nLike a rat can never beat the wheel\r\nThere is a wiretap stealing a nightmare\r\nShadows laughing and making deals\r\nLet your hair hang down for this moment\r\nHeavy trial but we'll make it disappear\n\n\n\nThey can't take away\n\nThis underground dream\n\n\n\nGuns or education\n\nThe answer's larger than the Hollywood sign\n\nBigger souls can see the writing\n\nOn the burning wall of eternity\n\nThe bastions of penitentiary\n\nReaction will pull broken hearts through\n\n\n\nThe can't take away\n\nThis underground dream",
