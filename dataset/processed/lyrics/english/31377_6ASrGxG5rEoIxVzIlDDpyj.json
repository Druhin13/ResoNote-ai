  "lyrics": "I wish that I could reach out\r\nSteal all your feelings\r\nThey'd fit me like a glove\r\nInstead I've just been sleeping\r\nStraight through the summer\r\nHow they beg me to wake up\n\n\n\nAnd all my wasted youth's not wasted\n\n\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\n\n\nI wish that I could march in\n\nStand up for something\n\nBut there's nothing i believe\n\nI get a little older\n\nMaybe even wiser\n\nBut my heart's stuck on my sleeve\n\n\n\nAnd all my wasted youth's not wasted\n\n\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\n\n\nAnd when all that's left are bed bones\n\nAnd we step off all our misled thrones\n\nAfter all the let downs and let-go's\n\nHold your breath, play dead, ready, set, no\n\nReady, set?\n\nNo\n\nReady, set?\n\nNo\n\n\n\nAnd all my wasted youth isn't wasted\n\n\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you\n\nIf it's on you",
