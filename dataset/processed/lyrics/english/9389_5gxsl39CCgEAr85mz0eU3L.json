You nigga's couldn't kill jack\n\nYou lookin' just like Aku, like cartoons\n\nWas the diamond in the rough, now Cozz the one that drop jewels\n\nStill tryin' to cop jewels, a couple of cars too\n\nManage with some large boobs, but don't you call me no fool\n\nI know none of these thing is real\n\nYeah, trust me I see it well, it's the size of sea's whale\n\nPictures couldn't be bigger, but shit I got dreams still\n\nBetter act like you got a clue, I'm fuckin' with Dreamville\n\nJust because they got Loot (cha-ching), (haha) naw, salute\n\nI'm playin', it's not true, you know I mean well\n\nAs I watch the team build, the family tree swells, well\n\nThe dream team goin' crazy on beats we don't think it's sellin'\n\nAnd seems to sell, cursed with a gift, profanity, jingle bells\n\nAre actually Annabelle, challenge me and you fail\n\nWhole faculty gettin' killed, catch me, get sent to jail\n\nWithout writtin' me bill, better shackle me well\n\n'Cause if them shackles do crack then Cody Mac gone be healed\n\nGone be ballin' like Shaq, for real, your woman back in the field\n\nShe gone want the sack like I pass in the NFL\n\nPoint the finger like Uncle Sam and get tax for real\n\nSo, don't be scared, just relax and chill (relax and chill motherfucker chill)",
