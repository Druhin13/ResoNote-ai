Romance of the plastic scenes\n\nI can't see you breathe\n\nThey're coming after me\n\nHonestly it's running through my veins you see I don't need their surgeries\n\nI just want to be\n\nBut they are coming after me\n\n\n\nThere is a little story I'd like to tell\n\nAbout this little boy who came from hell\n\nSit right there and listen real good\n\nIll tell you all the ways hes misunderstood\n\nWell I see you standing there With that ol wicked stare\n\nJust stay for the show\n\nAre you ready no are you ready to go\n\n\n\nChemically it's running through my veins you see? Romance of the plastic scenes\n\nI can't see you breathe\n\nThey're coming after me\n\nHonestly it's running through my veins you see I don't need their surgeries\n\nI just want to be\n\nBut they are coming after me\n\n\n\nIm mr. doctor man who questions his hands\n\nLost his mind but is clinically fine\n\nBut he found a way to cope needle in his throat\n\nFalling down but the world is spinning round\n\n\n\nI'm stuck in my boom boom room\n\nPeople are dancing after their operation\n\nI want you to move\n\nBut nobody's moving after their medications\n\nI can't hear the room\n\nPeople are dancing after their operation\n\nI want you to move\n\nBut nobody's moving at all\n\n\n\nChemically it's running through my veins you see? Romance of the plastic scenes\n\nI can't see you breathe\n\nThey're coming after me\n\nHonestly it's running through my veins you see I don't need their surgeries\n\nI just want to be\n\nBut they are coming after me\n\n\n\nOh no\n\nOh oh no no\n\nOh no no no\n\nTheir coming after me\n\nOh no\n\nAfter me\n\nNo no\n\nTheir coming after me",
