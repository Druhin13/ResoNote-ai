  "lyrics": "I would have walked through fire to kiss your lips\r\nDo you still think about it, of what you did?\r\nStill see your old apartment, like a bad trip\r\nWish I could forget all the places we've been\r\nHot and heavy with your goodbyes\n\nBoy, you know how to make a girl cry\n\nWe're sleeping in a bed full of lies\n\nAnd now than I'm older, I can see why\n\n\n\nYou make me feel high\n\n'Cause you had me so low, low, low\n\nYou only seem tall\n\n'Cause you stumped my growth, growth, growth\n\nI only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you\n\nNow that I know\n\nThat wasn't love , that wasn't love, that was just hope\n\n\n\nThat wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope\n\n\n\nAlways another bender, I lose control\n\nI thought I'd get it back when\n\nYou came back home to me, darling\n\nBut I never had it, did I? Your heart's a trip\n\nAnd all the magic we felt, was just a hit\n\n\n\nHot and heavy with your goodbyes\n\nBoy, you know how to make a girl cry\n\nWe're sleeping in a bed full of lies\n\nAnd now than I'm older, I can see why\n\n\n\nYou make me feel high\n\n'Cause you had me so low, low, low\n\nYou only seem tall\n\n'Cause you stumped my growth, growth, growth\n\nI only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you\n\nNow that I know (Now that I know)\n\nThat wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope\n\n\n\nThat wasn't love, that wasn't lov, that was just hope\n\n\n\nYou make me feel high\n\n'Cause you had me so low, low, low\n\nYou only seem tall\n\n'Cause you stumped my growth, growth, growth\n\nI only wanted you 'cause I couldn't have you\n\nNow that I know (Now that I know)\n\nThat wasn't love, that wasn't love, that was just hope",
