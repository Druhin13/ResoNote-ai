  "lyrics": "Well I was born in a small town\r\nAnd I live in a small town\r\nProb'ly die in a small town\r\nOh, those small communities\r\nAll my friends are so small town\n\nMy parents live in the same small town\n\nMy job is so small town\n\nProvides little opportunity\n\n\n\nEducated in a small town\n\nTaught the fear of Jesus in a small town\n\nUsed to daydream in that small town\n\nAnother boring romantic that's me\n\n\n\nBut I've seen it all in a small town\n\nHad myself a ball in a small town\n\nMarried an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town\n\nNow she's small town just like me\n\n\n\nNo I cannot forget where it is that I come from\n\nI cannot forget the people who love me\n\nYeah, I can be myself here in this small town\n\nAnd people let me be just what I want to be\n\n\n\nGot nothing against a big town\n\nStill hayseed enough to say\n\nLook who's in the big town\n\nBut my bed is in a small town\n\nOh, and that's good enough for me\n\n\n\nWell I was born in a small town\n\nAnd I can breathe in a small town\n\nGonna die in this small town\n\nAnd that's prob'ly where they'll bury me",
