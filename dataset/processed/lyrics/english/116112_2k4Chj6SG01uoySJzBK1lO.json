  "lyrics": "You're a vodka drink\r\nWith two lemons and no lime\r\nYou won't listen to the words\r\nBut you'll sing 'em when they rhyme\r\nYou're a Sunday backwards ball cap\r\nDrive too fast when it rains\n\nAnd you talk like you're from Charleston\n\nBut you're just made that way\n\n\n\nPut together like an angel\n\nTempted by your every tangle\n\nBet you don't even know how\n\nI'm hanging on to every word you say\n\nEvery touch damn near kills me\n\nNever thought that anybody\n\nCould make me want to slow down and stay\n\nBut baby you're made that way\n\n\n\nYou don't overthink\n\nSo you're a complicated mess\n\nNot afraid to make mistakes\n\nHold your cards close to the vest\n\nYou're Christmas lights in August\n\nWon't wake up 'til 10 a.m\n\nAnd my heart pounds just like a kick drum\n\nAnytime that you walk in\n\n\n\nPut together like an angel\n\nTempted by your every tangle\n\nBet you don't even know how\n\nI'm hanging on to every word you say\n\nEvery touch damn near kills me\n\nNever thought that anybody\n\nCould make me want to slow down and stay\n\nBut baby you're made that way\n\n\n\nEverything falls into place\n\nAs soon as I see your face\n\nDon't stop loving me\n\nBaby don't stop loving me\n\n\n\nPut together like an angel\n\nTempted by your every tangle\n\nBet you don't even know how\n\nI'm hanging on to every word you say\n\nEvery touch damn near kills me\n\nNever thought that anybody\n\nCould make me want to slow down and stay\n\nBaby you're made that way\n\n\n\nYeah you were made that way\n\nBaby you were made that way",
