  "lyrics": "Hurry up before you go and get old\r\nHurry up before your blood runs cold\r\nNone of us were ever meant to stay\r\nWe're all gonna find out one day\r\nYou see life's too short to run it like a race\n\nSo it's never gonna matter if you win first place\n\n'Cause we're all the same\n\n\n\nStop waitin' on your fifteen minutes of fame, 'cause you're not special\n\nI'm not tryin' to rain on your parade, but you're not special\n\nI'm not tryin' to bring to you down, I'm not tryin' to sound so ineffectual\n\nBut you're not special\n\n\n\nHurry up before the bottle kicks in\n\nBefore the poison and the pain sets in\n\nIf you take it down a notch and you let me explain\n\nThat on this earth we are all the same\n\n\n\nAnd all I can say is...\n\n\n\nStop waitin' on your fifteen minutes of fame, 'cause you're not special\n\nI'm not tryin' to rain on your parade, but you're not special\n\nI'm not tryin' to bring to you down, I'm not tryin' to sound so ineffectual\n\n'Cause you're not special\n\n\n\nWe all live to love, we all fall apart, we all go to war for the faint of heart\n\nInstead we're condescending, there are no happy endings\n\nI won't hold my breath, I won't cast a doubt, I'd never sell you out\n\nBut I'll give you one last chance to own it, 'cause you're not a god or a poet, so...\n\n\n\nStop waitin' on your fifteen minutes of fame, 'cause you're not special\n\nI'm not tryin' to rain on your parade, but you're not special\n\nI'm not tryin' to bring to you down, I'm not tryin' to sound so ineffectual\n\nBut you're not special\n\n\n\nBut you're not special\n\nBut you're not special\n\n'Cause you're not special\n\n'Cause you're not special",
