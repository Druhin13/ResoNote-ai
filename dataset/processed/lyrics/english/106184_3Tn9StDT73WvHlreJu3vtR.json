  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Shine A Light par Hardwell\r\nI'm feeling lonely no one to hold me\nI can't sleep at night\nCause' I found a something I can't explain it\nI keep questioning why\n\nWithout you, I just fall apart\nOnly your fire can light the dark\nI need your love to open up my eyes\n\nShine a light and I will find you\nCall my name and let it guide you\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine\n\nShine a light and I will find you\n\nCall my name and let it guide you\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine\n\nShine a light and I will find you\nCall my name and let it guide you\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine\n\nShine a light and I will find you\nCall my name and let it guide you\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine\n\nBattle the weather\n\nBetter together than when we're alone\nJust dance through the pain\nAnd we'll find a way for us to make it home, home\n\nWithout you, I just fall apart\nOnly your fire can light the dark\nI need your love to open up my eyes\n\nShine a light and I will find you\nCall my name and let it guide you\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine\n\nShine a light-\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine\n\n\nShine a light and I will find you\nCall my name and let it guide you\nWe can face the world, side by side\nIf you give your heart\nI'll trade mine",
