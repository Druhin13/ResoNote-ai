  "lyrics": "It won't even hurt, I'm already dead (I'm already dead)\r\nVoices in my head, monsters under my bed\r\nI'm alone again, I lost all my friends\r\nWanna play pretend? Hope this never ends\r\nTalkin' to myself, know I crashed and burned (I crashed and I burned)\r\nThink they hate my guts, yeah, what I heard\n\nEverything my fault, when will I learn?\n\nThree days in the house, feelin' sick and disturbed\n\n\n\nBring me your flowers, I'll bring you my rope\n\nPlay all the records that we love the most\n\nBring me your flowers, I'll bring you my rope\n\nPlay all the records that we love the most\n\n\n\nFighting my demons, they keep tryna win\n\nLife of a loner, I want it to end\n\nHurt myself and I gave it three nights\n\nTold her I love her, I thought it'd be nice\n\nIt was my fault and I live with regret\n\nShe was a beauty and I paid my debts\n\nFlowers and rope had appeared on her chest\n\nThought she was different but she's like the rest\n\n\n\nBring me your flowers, I'll bring you my rope\n\nPlay all the records that we love the most\n\nBring me your flowers, I'll bring you my rope\n\nPlay all the records that we love the most",
