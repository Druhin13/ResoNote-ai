  "lyrics": "No one could ever say we lacked in passion\r\nTruth is we were burning like a flame\r\nLooking back, I couldn't tell you when it happened\r\nHas it been 20 years, or 20 days\r\nShould've picked her over whiskey\r\nLayed down my foolish pride\n\nI know it felt different when she kissed me\n\nI guess I've never been a kiss goodbye\n\nWell I've tried other women\n\nThey never felt the same\n\nBut I think what hurts the most is knowing I'm to blame\n\n\n\nAnd I wish that I could change it\n\nAnd it wouldn't be this painful\n\n'Cause the truth is that the devil had no business runnin' with an angel\n\n\n\nWell your eyes are like a north Alabama sunset\n\nAnd your smiles like Florida in the Spring\n\nI keep on booking shows, but you ain't come yet\n\nEven though you're in every song I sing\n\nCan't say I don't deserve it\n\nFor putting you through hell\n\nPeople keep asking if it was worth it\n\nI tell them this, it's still to soon to tell\n\nWell I've tried every whiskey\n\nFrom Jim to Jack to Crown\n\nBut losing you is the only thing that burns me going down\n\n\n\nAnd I wish that I could change it\n\nAnd it wouldn't be this painful\n\n'Cause the truth is that the devil had no business runnin' with an angel\n\n\n\nTruth is you're better off alone\n\nAnd the best thing I can do is let you go\n\nHolding you was heaven, but losing you was hell\n\nI should've known the devil had no business, runnin' with an angel\n\nRunnin' with an angel\n\nRunnin' with an angel",
