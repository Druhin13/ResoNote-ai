  "lyrics": "Is this how you want to live your lives?\r\nInside the vulture's circle\r\nCan you feel the talons in your neck?\r\nOnly the strong survive you say?\r\nJust pray that prey you don't become\r\nYou've got no time for safety nets\n\n\n\nThere are no alpha wolves\n\nOnly those struggling to survive the state of nature\n\nDomestic animals lost without the trappings of their civilization\n\nYou like to play armchair eugenicist, militant pessimist\n\nAn ivory tower that's built upon\n\nThe product of a million labors\n\n\n\nRegression to the mean, repression of the weak\n\nFraudulent pyramid scheme of human hierarchy\n\n\n\nDo you ever wonder why you've been deprived\n\nThe wealth of nations?\n\nDo you feel the trickle down your leg?\n\nPreoccupied with war against your own and your own home\n\nHow is it you're not already dead?\n\n\n\nAnother failed experiment\n\nEvidence suggests you will not pass the last great filter\n\nThe soldiers won't defend the hive\n\nWhen the Queen neglects to satisfy the builders\n\nYou like to play the devil's advocate, passive and impotent\n\nBrood over fallen empires\n\nThat were built upon the bones of millions\n\n\n\nNarrow minded sanctimonious\n\nSelf-serving sophistry\n\nGreed governing holiness?\n\nNot in the version I have seen\n\n\n\nYou will not see the stars\n\nDoomed to the tides\n\nAccess denied, fated to die",
