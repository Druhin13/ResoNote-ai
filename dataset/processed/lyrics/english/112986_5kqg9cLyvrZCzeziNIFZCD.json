  "lyrics": "Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain\r\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons,\r\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\r\nThough you're thinking that\r\nyou're leaving there too soon,\r\nYou're leaving there too soon.\n\n\n\nIt's so noisy at the fair\n\nBut all your friends are there\n\nAnd the candy floss you had\n\nAnd your mother and your dad.\n\n\n\nOh, to live on Sugar Mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons,\n\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\n\nThough you're thinking that\n\nyou're leaving there too soon,\n\nYou're leaving there too soon.\n\n\n\nThere's a girl just down the aisle,\n\nOh, to turn and see her smile.\n\nYou can hear the words she wrote\n\nAs you read the hidden note.\n\n\n\nOh, to live on Sugar Mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons,\n\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\n\nThough you're thinking that\n\nyou're leaving there too soon,\n\nYou're leaving there too soon.\n\n\n\nNow you're underneath the stairs\n\nAnd you're givin' back some glares\n\nTo the people who you met\n\nAnd it's your first cigarette.\n\n\n\nOh, to live on Sugar Mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons,\n\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\n\nThough you're thinking that\n\nyou're leaving there too soon,\n\nYou're leaving there too soon.\n\n\n\nNow you say you're leavin' home\n\n'Cause you want to be alone.\n\nAin't it funny how you feel\n\nWhen you're findin' out it's real?\n\n\n\nOh, to live on Sugar Mountain\n\nWith the barkers and the colored balloons,\n\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\n\nThough you're thinking that\n\nyou're leaving there too soon,\n\nYou're leaving there too soon.\n\n\n\nOh, to live on Sugar Mountain\n\nwith the barkers and the colored balloons,\n\nYou can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain\n\nThough you're thinking that\n\nyou're leaving there too soon,\n\nYou're leaving there too soon.",
