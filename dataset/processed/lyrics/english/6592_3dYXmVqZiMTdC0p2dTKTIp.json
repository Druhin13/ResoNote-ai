  "lyrics": "Yeah, I think I need a therapist\r\nSomeone who can get in my head and show me the way\r\nLike clarity, you know, calm my nerves\r\nAnd block the way from going to pure insanity\r\nCrossed home with all these nights alone\r\nAnd going on hikes to be above the clouds to find peace for the moment\n\n\n\nSearching, searching\n\nI feel like I'm searching for something\n\nThat's not gonna show up anyway\n\nI'm three years deep, but nothing to show for it\n\nPenthouse dreams\n\nWanna put the city\n\nRight on the map of my team\n\nWhat the fuck do you mean?\n\n\n\nEmpty promises, empty promises\n\nTicking gotta get on top of this, no time, no time\n\nWe getting kicked out and then you're saying things are fine\n\nDeportation love, losing all your fine\n\nIs this do or die?\n\n\n\nIs this do or die?\n\nIs this do or die?\n\nIs this do or die?\n\nIs this do or die?\n\n\n\nI feel like that\n\nI'm a little bit misunderstood when it comes to things\n\nLike what I really want\n\nLike what I see in five years for me in the Carribean\n\nAnd that's someone who made it\n\nSomeone who stayed through the bushes, that made it\n\nEven do everything and didn't get faded\n\nYou were diamond, we all gotta take it, yeah\n\n\n\nEmpty promises, empty promises\n\nTicking gotta get on top of this, no time, no time\n\nWe getting kicked out and then you're saying things are fine\n\nDeportation love, losing all your fine\n\nIs this do or die?\n\n\n\nIs this do or die?\n\nIs this do or die?\n\nIs this do or die?\n\nIs this do or die?\n\n\n\nIs this do or die?",
