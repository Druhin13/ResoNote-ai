  "lyrics": "Do you know who you are?\r\nI've had so many lives\r\nIt gets confusing\r\nAnd when you come to my door\r\nIt's hard to not consider how things could've been\n\n\n\nIt isn't wrong, it isn't right\n\nIt isn't dark, it isn't light\n\nWe just wake it up and watch it fly\n\n\n\nLast night I slow danced with younger men\n\nDo you remember who I was?\n\nI was that girl again\n\n\n\nLast night, I tried pretending\n\nAnd today I am remembering how the end is the beginning\n\n\n\nWill you stay up late?\n\nAnd tell me how you tried to understand\n\nJust too many mistakes\n\n\n\nIf there's anyone who could forgive I'd call out your name\n\n\n\nIt isn't wrong, it isn't right\n\nIt isn't dark, it isn't light\n\nWe just wake it up and watch it fly\n\n\n\nLast night I slow danced with younger men\n\nDo you remember who I was?\n\nI was that fool again\n\n\n\nLast night, I tried pretending\n\nAnd today I am remembering how the end is the beginning\n\n\n\nThese days I get you all alone\n\nWe'll shuffle through those memories\n\nAnd though they say youth is wasted on the young\n\nWe never could've blasted through those nights\n\nThrough streets and stars\n\nKnowing what we know now\n\n\n\nLast night I slow danced with younger men\n\nDo you remember who I was?\n\nI was that girl again\n\n\n\nLast night, I tried pretending\n\nAnd today I am remembering how the end is the beginning\n\n\n\nHow the end is the beginning",
