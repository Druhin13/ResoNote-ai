  "lyrics": "Look at that wild Palomino runnin' like he's scared\r\nHe caught the Devil's shadow when he was unprepared\r\nOh, the dark is gonna get ya, and there ain't no place to hide\r\nYeah, the dark is gonna get ya, it'll come for you tonight\r\nIt'll come for you tonight\n\nWell Darlin' I won't blame you if you turn around and run\n\nWho'd wanna be standin' on the wrong end of a gun?\n\nOh, the dark is gonna get ya, and you're runnin' out of time\n\nYeah, the dark is gonna get ya, and soon you will be mine\n\n\n\nDaylight never cares once I love someone\n\nDon't come any closer to my heart if you're afraid of the dark\n\n\n\nLook at that lone desperado thinkin' he's the one\n\nWell he can go and draw his bow, but he don't know when all is said and done\n\nThat the dark is gonna get ya, and there's nothin' you can do\n\nOh, the dark is gonna get ya, and you're gonna find out soon\n\n\n\nDaylight never cares once I love someone\n\nDon't come any closer to my heart if you're afraid of the dark\n\n\n\nIf you're afraid of the dark",
