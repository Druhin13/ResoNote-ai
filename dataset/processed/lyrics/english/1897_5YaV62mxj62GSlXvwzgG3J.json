  "lyrics": "When I open my eyes for a moment I'm fine\r\nUntil I'm scrolling through the days headlines\r\nTry to keep myself numb, turn the radio on\r\nHoping to shake it but it burned my mind\r\nWish that I could go somewhere the news is good\n\nAnd throw away my phone\n\nI, I don't wanna look 'cause\n\nI don't wanna know\n\nBut I can't ignore it now\n\nBaby, if I'm being honest\n\nI wish I could check out (don't do it)\n\n\n\nI need a vacation (don't do it)\n\nI just need a break right now\n\nGet away, get away\n\nFrom a cold and crazy world\n\nI need a vacation\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world\n\n\n\nMad, mad\n\nMad, mad\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world\n\n\n\nDo the best that I can, standing up to the man\n\nFighting the power tryna hold us down\n\nNever give up the fight, rising up for what's right\n\nBut I need to take a breath before I down\n\n\n\nWish that I could go somewhere the news is good\n\nAnd throw away my phone\n\nI, I don't wanna look 'cause\n\nI don't wanna know\n\nBut I can't ignore it now\n\nBaby, if I'm being honest\n\nI wish I could check out (don't do it)\n\n\n\nI need a vacation (don't do it)\n\nI just need a break right now\n\nGet away, get away\n\nFrom a cold and crazy world\n\nI need a vacation\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world\n\n\n\nMad, mad\n\nMad, mad\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world\n\nMad, mad\n\nMad, mad\n\n\n\nGot me on my knees, got me on my knees\n\nDon't do it\n\nI won't let myself give up right now\n\nDon't do it\n\nI get upon my feet, I get upon my feet\n\nAnd get to it\n\nEven though the world is upside down\n\n\n\nI need a vacation (don't do it)\n\nI just need a break right now\n\nGet away, get away\n\nFrom a cold and crazy world (cold and crazy world)\n\nI need a vacation\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world\n\n\n\nMad, mad\n\nMad, mad\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world\n\nMad, mad\n\n'Cause it's a mad, mad world",
