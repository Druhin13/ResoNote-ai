  "lyrics": "Yeah, yeah, yeah\r\nCity lights, blurry face\r\nBeen missing the feeling, the mistakes\r\nTook a walk, fast pace\r\nShoes off, only four blocks to your place\n\n\n\nHad to climb through the window 'cause you lost your key\n\nGetting high with the lights low, had a few more drinks\n\nAnd the next thing we know, your lips on me\n\nPut it on so you can take it off of me\n\n\n\nCashmere, left it lying by your bed\n\nIt's the colour red, how could I forget?\n\nCashmere (cashmere), last night we made such a mess\n\nI knew when I left I'd see you again\n\nSo what if I did it on purpose?\n\nSo what? Yeah, I did it on purpose\n\nCashmere (cashmere), left it lying by your bed\n\nI knew when I left I'd see you again\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n\n\nLeft a mark on my neck\n\nBut I don't mind and I don't try to hide it\n\nYou woke me up on your chest\n\nAnd tonight let's do it all again\n\n\n\nWe'll climb through the window, you can lose your key\n\nGetting high with the lights low, had a few more drinks\n\nAnd the next thing we know, your lips on me\n\nPut it on so you can take it off of me\n\n\n\nCashmere, left it lying by your bed\n\nIt's the colour red, how could I forget?\n\nCashmere (cashmere), last night we made such a mess\n\nI knew when I left I'd see you again\n\nSo what if I did it on purpose?\n\nSo what? Yeah, I did it on purpose\n\nCashmere (cashmere), left it lying by your bed\n\nI knew when I left I'd see you again\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nYeah (cashmere), yeah (cashmere), yeah\n\n\n\nCashmere, left it lying by your bed\n\nIt's the colour red, how could I forget?\n\nCashmere (cashmere), last night we made such a mess\n\nI knew when I left I'd see you again",
