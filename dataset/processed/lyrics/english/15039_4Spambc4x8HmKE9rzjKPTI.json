  "lyrics": "We were watching TV getting wasted\r\nWay down in the basement\r\nHanging out loose and shameless\r\nThey're up on the top of skyscrapers\r\nThinking that they're ageless\r\nTalking loud pretending like they made it\n\n\n\nIf you drink champagne on a private plane\n\nDoesn't mean to say you're baller\n\nMaybe you're just falling down\n\nI don't want your girls\n\nI don't want your world at all\n\nNo\n\nSo\n\n\n\nI'm a freak now (freak now)\n\nThat's the way I'm living till they carry me out\n\nI'm a freak now (freak now)\n\nLong as I'm still breathing they'll be hearing me shout\n\nCome on, so come on\n\nSo come on, come on\n\n\n\nOut there super yachting with their fake friends\n\nTrying to keep it on trend\n\nMaking fun of anyone who's different\n\n\n\nWe don't need that kind of entertainment\n\nVapid hollow vain sh*t\n\nRather show me love and not your bracelets\n\n\n\nIf you drink champagne on a private plane\n\nDoesn't mean to say you're baller\n\nMaybe you're just falling down\n\nI don't want your girls\n\nI don't want your world at all\n\nNo\n\nSo\n\n\n\nI'm a freak now (freak now)\n\nThat's the way I'm living till they carry me out\n\nI'm a freak now (freak now)\n\nLong as I'm still breathing they'll be hearing me shout\n\nCome on, so come on\n\nSo come on, come on\n\n\n\nThey say the greatest things in life are free\n\nAnd I believe, I believe, I believe it\n\nAnd I don't wanna float in your debris\n\n\n\nYou know the greatest things in life are free\n\nLet's believe, let's believe, let's believe it\n\nSo come and watch the sunset with me\n\n\n\nI'm a freak now (freak now)\n\nThat's the way I'm living till they carry me out\n\nI'm a freak now (freak now)\n\nLong as I'm still breathing they'll be hearing me shout\n\nCome on, so come on\n\nSo come on, come on",
