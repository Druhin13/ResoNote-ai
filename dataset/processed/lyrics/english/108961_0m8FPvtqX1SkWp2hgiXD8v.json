Gouldman)\r\nI'd give you everything and more and that's for sure\r\nI'd bring you diamond rings and things right to your door\r\nTo thrill you with delight\r\nI'd bring you diamonds bright\n\nEverything that will excite\n\nMake you dream of me at night\n\nFor your love, for your love\n\nI would give you stars above\n\nI'd give the stars if they were mine to give\n\nI'd give the moon every day that I live\n\nTo thrill you with delight\n\nI'd bring you diamonds bright\n\nEverything that will excite\n\nMake you dream of me at night\n\nFor your love, for your love\n\nI would give you stars above",
