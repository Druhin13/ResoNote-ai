  "lyrics": "Condemned to the gallows\r\nGoodnight…\r\nGripping the brightest grid\r\nA surgical drive to increase the noise\n\nIce cold realization of the silent wind… slowly drags me up into a splintered reason\n\nEmptiness engulf me\n\n\n\nAlign the love inside me\n\nLet misery wake me\n\n\n\nSearch low… abandoned\n\n\n\nThe creaking floors cry out below\n\nA limping glimpse of next steps… the fog showers the last light of day\n\n\n\nDestroy the wooden frame\n\nTrust the creaking sounds\n\nSeek the tunnel… to walk high above\n\nSearch low\n\nConfront the night\n\n\n\nWarm blood drips on cold snow… the curtain surrounds logical thought\n\n\n\nCondemned to the gallows\n\n\n\nThe crimson moonbeam lights my journey\n\nCrippled with time... desperate strides into nothing\n\nThe crimson moonbeam… hear the waking\n\nCrippled with time... desperate strides into nothing",
