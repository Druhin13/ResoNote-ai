That overpaid shit?\n\nStill got everybody on that same shit\n\nYou so extraordinary, you so superficial lately\n\nYou don't need those credit cards or that paper unless is a tissue you baby\n\n'Cause you cryin' too often, get the fuck off it\n\nSick of the shit, quick it'll make you nauseous\n\nCautious, you ain't will feel save in a fortress\n\nEven with no make-up on you still gorgeous\n\n\n\nYou look nice in your new outfit\n\nYou look even better when you take that off\n\nYou used to being a sidechick\n\nYou feel much better if you break that off\n\nYou look sad in that brand new whip\n\nYou look much better if you had your own\n\nYou look mad in that big old crib\n\nYou feel much better when you have a home\n\n\n\nJust choose love over them dollars\n\nLove over them dollars\n\nI promise you'll better off, I swear\n\nChoose love over them dollars\n\nLove over them dollars\n\nI promise you'll better off\n\n\n\nYo, this could go opposite spectrum\n\nMy homies with good hearted women who fall in a bed with a girl you just met her\n\nKnowin' that you got somebody at home but decided to go for the pleasure\n\nI used to do it, that shit make my head hurt\n\nAnd it gets worse addicted to the paper\n\nI'm more 'bout the business ain't care what she said first\n\nDissectin' priorities lately, only if this love could pay me\n\nI be divided my time between all these lines\n\nAt the down on my mind that's my baby\n\nCrazy how it could change in a moment\n\nWhen back in the day I thought I didn't want it, then\n\nI started growin' and you started showin'\n\nThat friendship comes first and you turn to my woman\n\nYou so extraordinary, don't be superficial baby\n\nYou don't need those credit cards 'cause I got it all\n\nIt ain't a issue baby, I was workin' too often, had to get off it\n\nSick off the shit, quick it'll make you nauseous\n\nExhausted, got you feelin' safe in a fortress\n\nEven with no make-up on you still gorgeous\n\n\n\nYou look nice in your new outfit\n\nYou look even better when you take that off\n\nYou used to be a sidechick\n\nYou feel much better if you break that off\n\nYou look sad in that brand new whip\n\nYou look much better if you had your own\n\nYou look mad in that big old crib\n\nYou feel much better when you have a home\n\n\n\nJust choose love over them dollars\n\nLove over them dollars\n\nI promise you'll better off, I swear\n\nJust choose love over them dollars\n\nLove over them dollars\n\nI promise you'll better off, oh",
