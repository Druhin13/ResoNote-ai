  "lyrics": "Most nights I can keep it buried in the back of my head\r\nOn most nights I can have a couple drinks, I can take of the edge\r\nAnd then I don't have to think about, try not to think about you\r\nThat's what I do on most nights, but tonight\r\nI'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me\n\nI'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me\n\nI'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me\n\nI wanna feel it, no mercy\n\nI reminisce you, I'm gonna go there\n\nI know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care\n\n'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you\n\nBaby I, I'm gonna miss you\n\n\n\nMost nights I try to stay away from any memory\n\nFrom this nights when you were still sleepin', dreamin' next to me\n\nBut I'm 'bout to put on continue and slow dance in this burnin' room\n\n\n\nI'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me\n\nI'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me\n\nI'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me\n\nI wanna feel it, no mercy\n\nI reminisce you, I'm gonna go there\n\nI know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care\n\n'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you\n\nBaby I, I'm gonna miss you\n\n\n\nI'm gonna thing about Charleston, weekend Airbnb\n\nAnd that Carolina heat had nothin' on you and me\n\nI'm gonna think about that first kiss in the rain, it was June\n\nRemember how we said forever? I'm gonna think about that too\n\n\n\nI'm gonna miss you, I let it hit me\n\nI'm gonna sit here and wish you were with me\n\nI'm gonna let that goodbye hurt me\n\nI wanna feel it, no mercy\n\nI reminisce you, I'm gonna go there\n\nI know I shouldn't, but right now I don't care\n\n'Stead of spendin' my night losin' the fight, tryin' to forget you\n\nBaby I, I'm gonna miss you\n\n\n\nI'm gonna miss you",
