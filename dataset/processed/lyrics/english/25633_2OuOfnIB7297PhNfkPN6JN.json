  "lyrics": "When you try to close your eyes,\r\nAnd put yourself in a dream,\r\nSleeping and then dreaming,\r\nMeans that you are truly free,\r\nIt's the best thing that you can do,\r\nAs far as I can see.\n\n\n\nOh, quiet your mind,\n\nOh, quiet your mind.\n\n\n\nIn the country, in the foothills,\n\nFound you down in the fall,\n\nFinally found a vision,\n\nVision to all,\n\nYou in it, so completely,\n\nWhen you don't even try.\n\nSet loose, all your worries,\n\nLike doves into the sky.\n\n\n\nOh, quiet your mind,\n\nOh, quiet your mind.\n\n\n\nSo now I'll send a lullaby,\n\nWarp it in a dream,\n\nTo take the weight, from your shoulders,\n\nAnd the pressure from your teeth,\n\nIt must seem like, a ghost sometimes,\n\nAppearing from thin air,\n\nSo take hold, of this quiet song\n\n[?] find you there.\n\n\n\nOh, quiet your mind",
