  "lyrics": "Perfect on the outside\r\nBroken on the in\r\nSmiling for the camera just to feed our addiction\r\nWe're just fake advertisements\r\nselling artificial versions of ourselves\r\nLike fallen cities we disguise as paradise\r\nIt's like we're living in fantasy land\r\nBurying our heads in the sand\r\nRunning from the dark, covering our flaws\r\nSo everything is perfect when we're living in fantasy land\r\nWe'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned\r\nLiving in fantasy land\r\nThe grass is always greener on the other side\r\nInstead of sowing our seeds we believe in little white lies\r\nWe display split personalities out on our trophy shelves\r\nTo erase the parts of us that we don't want to face\r\nIt's like we're living in fantasy land\r\nBurying our heads in the sand\r\nRunning from the dark, covering our flaws\r\nSo everything is perfect when we're living in fantasy land\r\nWe'll be damned, we'll be damned, we'll be damned\r\nLiving in fantasy land\r\nStuck in utopia, a fabrication\r\nScreaming out for help so silently",
