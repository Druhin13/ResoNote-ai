  "lyrics": "One two three\r\nShe's a real left winger 'cause she been down south\r\nAnd held peasants in her arms\r\nShe said \"I could tell you a story that could make you cry\"\r\n\"What about you?\"\r\nI said \"Me too\"\n\n\"I could tell you a story that will make you cry\"\n\nAnd she sighed \"Aaahh\"\n\nI said \"I wanna be a singer like Lou Reed\"\n\n\"I like Lou Reed\" she said sticking her tongue in my ear\n\n\"Let's go, let's sit, let's talk\"\n\n\"Politics go so good with beer\"\n\n\"And while we're at it baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?\"\n\nI said \"Loosing my penis to a whore with disease\"\n\n\"Just kidding\" I said \"Loosing my life to a whore with disease\"\n\nI said \"Please... I'm a humble guy with a healthy desire\"\n\n\"Don't give me no shit because...\"\n\n\n\nI've been tired (6x)\n\n\n\nI tell a tale of a girl, but I call her a woman\n\nShe's a little bit older than me\n\nStrong legs, strong face, voice like milk, breasts like a cluster of grapes\n\nI can't escape the ways she raise me\n\nShe'll make you feel like Solomon be one of your babies even if you had no one\n\n(And while we're at it baby, why don't you tell me one of your biggest fears?)\n\nTook my sleep after setting my loins on fire\n\nBut that's OK because...\n\n\n\nI've been tired (6x)\n\n\n\nI've been tired (9x)\n\nT-i-r-e-d spells it\n\nSpells it",
