  "lyrics": "Who put bars across your window of opportunity?\r\nDid you see?\r\nYou called me a broken record\r\nBut I'll-But I'll never be\r\nI am trying to be honest\r\nIf I end up sounding cold\n\nIt's the middle of the winter\n\nAnd I wanted you to\n\n\n\nHear me out! I'm out on the street\n\nAnd I'm trying to find your building, baby\n\nHear me out! I'll be in retreat\n\nI been going 'round in circles, lately\n\n\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, thought of you\n\nI though it through and I'm calling you\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, I thought of you\n\nI thought it through then I called you\n\n\n\nYou told me I'm hard to live with\n\nBut you said it out of spite\n\nI may put you through some suffering\n\nBut I never prove you right\n\nIt's a chapter that you're stuck on\n\nAnd you'd rather read alone\n\nI'm an uninspiring ending\n\nBut the best you've ever known\n\n\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, I thought of you\n\nI though it through and I'm calling you\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, I thought of you\n\nI thought it through then I called you\n\n\n\nHear me out! I'm out on the street\n\nAnd I'm trying to find your building, baby\n\nHear me out! I'll be your treat\n\nI been going 'round in circles, lately\n\n\n\nHear me out! I'm back on the street\n\nAnd I'm trying to find your building, baby\n\nHear me out! I'll be in retreat\n\nI been going 'round the circles, lately\n\n\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, I thought of you\n\nI though it through and I'm calling you\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, I thought of you\n\nI though it through and I'm calling you\n\nI'm not like \"Can we just pretend?\"\n\nI thought of her, I thought of you\n\nI thought it through then I called you",
