  "lyrics": "I was bound to something bigger\r\nAnd more important than a single human life\r\nI wore my uniform with honor\r\nMy service was not a sacrifice\r\nBut what saves you in the battle\r\nCan kill you at home\n\nA soldier, soldiering on\n\n\n\nYou don't fight for yourself\n\nYou fight for the ones by your side\n\nAnd they do the same for you\n\nAnd to live you must be willing to die\n\nBut what saves you in the battle\n\nCan kill you at home\n\nA soldier, soldiering on\n\n\n\nSuck it up, shut it down\n\nIt don't matter how you feel\n\nMission first, just drive on\n\nA soldier is a cog inside a wheel\n\nUp or down, all for one\n\nThe closest family I have known\n\nA soldier, soldiering on\n\n\n\nI was bound to something bigger\n\nAnd more important than a single human life\n\nI wore my uniform with honor\n\nMy service was not a sacrifice\n\nBut what saves you in the battle\n\nCan kill you at home\n\nA soldier, soldiering on",
