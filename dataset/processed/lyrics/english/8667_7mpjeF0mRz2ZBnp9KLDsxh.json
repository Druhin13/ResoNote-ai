  "lyrics": "All day, I listen out for Jenny's old coup√©\r\nMidnight blue, it's faded, but she's always been true\r\nHoliday, I haven't seen you since, yeah, I had to get away\r\nWindow pane, electricity illuminates the rain\r\nLean your face, hopeless, no embrace\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know where the silence comes from\n\nWhere space originates\n\n\n\nLay back, sink in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nI'm right, this is sin\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nCome around, give in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nLay back, sink in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\n\n\nOn closer inspection, it's just a reflection\n\nAnd I still move with feeling inside\n\nAnd it's the tyranny of questioning\n\nRing the diving bell\n\nI'm further down, I'm nearly out\n\nI'm deeper down the well\n\n\n\nI'm hopeless, no embrace\n\nI wanna know\n\nI wanna know where the silence comes from\n\nWhere space originates\n\n\n\nLay back, sink in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nI'm right, this is sin\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nCome around, give in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nLay back, sink in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\n\n\n\n\nLay back, sink in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nI'm right, this is sin\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nCome around, give in\n\nYou're not talking straight\n\nLay back, sink in\n\nYou're not talking straight",
