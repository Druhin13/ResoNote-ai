  "lyrics": "It's been a little cold\r\nAnd not outside\r\nSwitch out the wardrobe\r\nGotta be dressed for the ride\r\nGot hit with a winter breeze\r\nAnd oh, we like to act tough, what we do it for?\n\nBe careful with energy\n\nNo need to be so cold, I wanna be more\n\n\n\nOh, summer's calling\n\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\nOh, summer's calling\n\n(I done had a real long winter)\n\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\n\n\nI've been goin' through, you been through it (you been through it)\n\nI fall back to look at what we're doing (now)\n\nI can yell it at you, but what's the use? (Use)\n\nIf you really love me, gotta prove it\n\nIâ€™m carrying this baggage, need to pack light\n\nHate seein' you sad, I gotta act right\n\nI'm looking forward for the brighter\n\nOh, oh love\n\n\n\nOh, summer's calling\n\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\nOh, summer's calling\n\n(I done had a really long winter)\n\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\n\n\nHave you ever looked at someone and said, \"I could spend my whole life witcha\"?\n\nYou're lucky the greatest thing I can do is marry you\n\n'Cause if I could, I'd spill my blood\n\nDown to give you my last breath\n\nThe old me is on his last stretch\n\nI guess a new season's next (next)\n\n\n\nOh, summer's calling\n\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\nOoh, summer's calling\n\n(I done had a really long winter)\n\nA beautiful summer's calling\n\n\n\nMiscommunication leads to complication and...\n\nHere we are staring at each other as strangers, sleepin' in the same bed\n\n'Cause it's like, you were never taught how to use your words like that\n\nYou were never taught how to say loving things and caring things\n\nYou were just taught how to say what had to be said\n\nSo, I want the words that you don't have and I'm stuck trying to figure out what you feel\n\nJust think about it, like, what might this life be like if we put our pride to the side and let love lead the way",
