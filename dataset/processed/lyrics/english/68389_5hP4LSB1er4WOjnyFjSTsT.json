  "lyrics": "Enter the boy who’s into deep\r\nSweat is running down his cheek\r\nBreath short, mouth dry, knees weak\r\nHe finds it hard to take the heat\r\nForever falling like a domino\n\n(we’re sorry ladies and gentlemen but unfortunately we are going to have to postpone the remainder of tonight’s show)\n\n\n\nWoah he’s just a once upon a time that went up in smoke\n\nWoah yeah they’re begging, and they can’t stop begging for more\n\nAll he has are hollywood dreams but he’s stuck on broadway streets\n\nCue another tragic scene because they’re begging and begging for more\n\n\n\n(we apologize for the inconvenience. We can now confirm we’ve got him back)\n\n\n\nCue the laughter, take a breath\n\nEnter the boy who lost his head\n\nYeah, he can’t keep his tears in check\n\nHe’s just an actor in distress\n\nForever falling like a domino\n\n\n\nHe’s standing centre stage\n\nBut he’s a chapter late\n\n\n\nWoah he’s just a once upon a time that went up in smoke\n\nWoah yeah they’re begging, and they can’t stop begging for more\n\nAll he has are hollywood dreams but he’s stuck on broadway streets\n\nCue another tragic scene because they’re begging and begging for more\n\n\n\n(come on, you’ve got this. Okay, this is your shot)\n\nHe’s standing centre stage\n\nIt’s nearly half past eight\n\nBut then he goes insane\n\nWhen they scream his name\n\n\n\nThen he took control and he just stole the show\n\n\n\nWoah more than a once upon a time that refused to choke\n\nWoah yeah they’re begging, and they can’t stop begging for more\n\nAll he had were hollywood dreams now he’s high on broadway streets\n\nCurtain calls the final scene, leave them begging and begging for more",
