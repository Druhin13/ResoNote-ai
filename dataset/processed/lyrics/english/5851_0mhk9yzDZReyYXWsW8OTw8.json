'bout a thing\n\n\n\nI can't deny\n\nShe got everything that I need in my life\n\nShe can't deny\n\nIf I go we won't be alright\n\n\n\nSay goodbye\n\nI don't wanna waste my time with crazy fights\n\nGirl you gotta let me go or hold me tight\n\nI don't wanna say goodnight\n\nDon't say goodbye\n\nSay goodbye\n\nI don't wanna waste my time with crazy fights\n\nGirl you gotta let me go or hold me tight\n\nI don't wanna say goodnight\n\nDon't say goodbye",
