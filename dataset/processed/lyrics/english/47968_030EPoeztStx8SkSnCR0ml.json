  "lyrics": "There ain't no hurricanes or tornados here\r\nThe storm has passed, now we are in the clear\r\nNo more cryin', no more raining tears\r\nThere ain't no hurricanes or tornados here\r\nThe sun shines every day, the birds are always singin'\n\nClouds are never hangin' in the sky\n\nI can't remember gray now that everything is golden\n\nDarkness no more\n\n\n\nThere ain't no hurricanes or tornados here\n\nThe storm has passed, now we are in the clear\n\nNo more cryin', no more raining tears\n\nThere ain't no hurricanes or tornados here\n\n\n\nAn ever-gentle breeze through the trees and easy whisper\n\nSleeping underneath a starry sky\n\nLife is but a dream, calm and peaceful water\n\nOcean sunrise\n\n\n\nThere ain't no hurricanes or tornados here\n\nThe storm has passed, now we are in the clear\n\nNo more cryin', no more raining tears\n\nThere ain't no hurricanes or tornados here",
