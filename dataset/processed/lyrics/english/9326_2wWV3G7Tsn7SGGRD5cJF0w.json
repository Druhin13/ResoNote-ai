  "lyrics": "You're in a better place, I've heard a thousand times\r\nAnd at least a thousand times I've rejoiced for you\r\nBut the reason why I'm broken, the reason why I cry\r\nIs how long must I wait to be with you\r\nI close my eyes and I see your face\n\nIf home's where my heart is then I'm out of place\n\nLord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow\n\nI've never been more homesick than now\n\n\n\nHelp me Lord cause I don't understand your ways\n\nThe reason why I wonder if I'll ever know\n\nBut, even if you showed me, the hurt would be the same\n\nCause I'm still here so far away from home\n\n\n\nI close my eyes and I see your face\n\nIf home's where my heart is then I'm out of place\n\nLord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow\n\nI've never been more homesick than now\n\n\n\nIn Christ, there are no goodbye\n\nAnd in Christ, there is no end\n\nSo I'll hold onto Jesus with all that I have\n\nTo see you again\n\nTo see you again\n\n\n\nAnd I close my eyes and I see your face\n\nIf home's where my heart is then I'm out of place\n\nLord, won't you give me strength to make it through somehow\n\nWon't you give me strength to make it through somehow\n\nWon't you give me strength to make it through somehow\n\n\n\nI've never been more homesick than now",
