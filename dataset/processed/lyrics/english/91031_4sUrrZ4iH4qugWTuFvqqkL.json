  "lyrics": "Little red dress hanging on a hanger\r\nOnly wear it when you're feeling dangerous\r\nWhen you slip it on slow in the mirror\r\nIt makes you want to drink too much\r\nWhen you can't unzip yourself, so you ask for a little help\r\nThrough a red wine, kiss-me smile\n\nI hope it's on tonight\n\n\n\nI hope when 1:15, rolls around\n\nYou need me, like I need you right now\n\nI don't care, what we said\n\nIf I'm on your mind, it ain't over - not yet\n\nYeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light\n\nWe've been on again, and off again so many times\n\nI hope it's on, tonight\n\nI hope it's on, tonight\n\n\n\nHope you're in the back of a yellow cab, and a song comes on from way back when\n\nThen it flips that switch inside you, make you want to pull me in\n\nAnd when you sing right up the stairs, while you're taking down your hair\n\nIt sets the room on fire\n\nI hope it's on, tonight\n\n\n\nI hope when 1:15, rolls around\n\nYou need me, like I need you right now\n\nI don't care, what we said\n\nIf I'm on your mind, it ain't over - not yet\n\nYeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light\n\nWe've been on again, and off again so many times\n\nI hope it's on, tonight\n\nI hope it's on, tonight\n\n\n\nI'm hope your head is on your phone\n\nAnd you don't want to be alone\n\nI really don't want to be alone\n\n\n\nI hope when 1:15, rolls around\n\nYou need me, like I need you right now\n\nYeah, I don't care, what we said\n\nIf I'm on your mind, it ain't over - not yet\n\nYeah, you and me are kinda like that blinking caution light\n\nWe've been on again, and off again so many times\n\nI hope it's on, tonight\n\nI hope it's on, tonight",
