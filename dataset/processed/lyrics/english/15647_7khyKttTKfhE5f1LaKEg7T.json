  "lyrics": "On the first...\r\nOn the first day...\r\nOn the first day, God created everything...\r\nOn the first day, God created everything there ever was\r\nOn the second day, God came to take it all back\r\n...piece by piece\n\n\n\nEmpty room\n\nCast about for a familiar object\n\nBecause my body needs coordinates to move\n\n\n\nIn the dark\n\nRange of motion shrivels all around me\n\nAll my nightmares I am slowly being cocooned\n\nA single calf in the hecatomb\n\n\n\nCrescent moon\n\nHollowed out of all my fabled insides\n\nOccam shave me down to primal truth—return me to the womb\n\n\n\nThe spirit held a magic flask\n\nSaid, \"Drink it to forget the past\n\nBut careful it's a poison batch\n\nEach drop more painful than the last\n\nIf you fail you'll wish for death\n\nIf you finish: you'll be free at last.\"\n\n\n\nAsa nisi masa\n\nAsa nisi masa\n\n\n\nAsa nisi masa\n\nAsa nisi masa\n\nHello?\n\n\n\nMother pulled from father's ribs,\n\nLittle baby in a crib, hands reaching up\n\nBefore the blinding light is split\n\nThrough the prism of your organs into colors\n\nAll that being and nothingness, on the same möbius strip\n\nSleep and waking up\n\n\n\nOn the first day\n\nWipe the blank slate\n\nAnd you join the banquet\n\nServed up helpless on a plate\n\nBut you find your land legs\n\nAnd you learn to imitate\n\nYou'll wear any feather and hope that your efforts attract a mate\n\n\n\nOne day your children find you,\n\nLocked in the bathroom,\n\nStaring in horror at the reflection of your face\n\nAnd you say you're sorry to the guests at your party\n\nBut you can't help wonder, who is this person you celebrate?\n\n\n\nAnd so the light fades\n\nIt's still your birthday\n\nSo blow out your past lives like they're candles on the cake",
