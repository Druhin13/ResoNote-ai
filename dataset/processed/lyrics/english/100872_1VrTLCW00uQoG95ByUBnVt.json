  "lyrics": "Alone at a corner table\r\nShe was watching me watching her\r\nI was singing about an old flame burning\r\nShe was hanging onto every word\r\nI was pouring out my feelings\r\nShe was pouring out the wine\n\nThrough the smoke and the beer\n\nIt was perfectly clear\n\nThat we were touching each other's minds\n\n\n\nIt was love ten feet away\n\nImagine her in my arms\n\nThat look on her face\n\nLying somewhere in some shadowy place\n\nIt was love just ten feet away\n\n\n\nI just knew my closing song would do it\n\nI knew that I was heaven bound\n\nI could tell she was new\n\nBut before I was through\n\nA stranger walked up and sat down\n\nHe was trying his best to impress her\n\nBut she never took her eyes off me\n\nWhen he got up and left, I said to myself\n\nWoah woah, what a night this would be\n\n\n\nIt was love ten feet away\n\nImagine her in my arms\n\nThat look on her face\n\nLying somewhere in some shadowy place\n\nIt was love just ten feet away\n\n\n\nIt was love ten feet away\n\nImagine her in my arms\n\nThat look on her face\n\nLying somewhere in some shadowy place\n\nIt was love just ten feet away",
