  "lyrics": "The fear is what shelters them. \nIt's what shades their eyes and muffles their ears.\r\nKeep them inside.\r\nLock them up in a closet known as home. \nIn here no one can find them. \nIn here no one can fill them with filth.\n\nThey were born with the silverware clenched in their teeth,\n\nand so help us, they will die with it too.\n\nNone of them will make anything of themselves. \n\nThey don't need their own lives. \n\nThe ones we have planned will work just fine. \n\nThe world is a terrifying place. \n\nWithout us they will never make it. \n\nThey will never reach their potential. \n\nThey will never ever surpass us. \n\nWithout our watchful eye, they might just leave us behind",
