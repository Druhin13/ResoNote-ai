  "lyrics": "The Animal in me, died tonight\r\nThought I'd never be, crying like a parasite\r\nBefore it gets too late, I’ll deny the pain\r\nStranger now to me, but tonight you will believe\r\nTonight I’m gonna leave it\n\nEvery little secret\n\nNever to believe it\n\nWalking on a ceiling\n\nWaiting on a feeling\n\nRunning from a notion\n\n\n\nBreathing in fresh air, see beyond the glare\n\nKilling empathy, when it makes sense to me\n\nPanic comes around, never coming down\n\nForever calling me, and I’m hiding like a beast\n\n\n\nTonight I’m gonna leave it\n\nEvery little secret\n\nNever to believe it\n\nWalking on a ceiling\n\nWaiting on a feeling\n\nRunning from a notion\n\n\n\nBefore it gets too late, you will find escape\n\nVoices calling me, like the lightning through the breeze\n\nTonight I’m gonna leave it\n\n\n\nEvery little secret\n\nNever to believe it\n\nWalking on a ceiling\n\nWaiting on a feeling\n\nRunning from a notion",
