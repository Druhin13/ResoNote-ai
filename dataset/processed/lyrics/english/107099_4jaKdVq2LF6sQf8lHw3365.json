  "lyrics": "Take a little piece of this until the winter start\r\nMake a little circle right before you fall apart\r\nI lay down with caution like the way you fold your arms\r\nTake a little piece of this before you fall apart\r\nWe've been wrestling something, reckless assumptions\n\nLately you've been skipping the parties, loving nobody\n\nYou say you're not distant for nothing, just wanna feel something\n\nBut this all this [?] time with loving, if you want private\n\n\n\nIs it true? Take a little piece of this until the winter start\n\nIs it true? Make a little circle right before you fall apart\n\nToo good to be true\n\nI lay down with cautions like the way you fold your arms\n\nToo good to be true\n\nTake a little piece of this before you fall apart\n\n\n\nAnd now you're shaken from something\n\nHere come the assumptions\n\nYou say you've got skin on the table\n\nBut you're not afraid of\n\nFriends that you no longer reply to\n\nYou give an [?]\n\nThen lay down in deep constellation\n\nHope you can make it\n\n\n\nToo good to be true\n\nTake a little piece of this until the winter start\n\nIs it true?\n\nMake a little circle right before you fall apart\n\nToo good to be true\n\nI lay down with cautions like the way you fold your arms\n\nToo good to be true\n\nTake a little piece of this before you fall apart\n\n\n\nOh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh\n\nOh-oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh",
