Bitch I wrote this song for you\n\nI really hope you like it a lot\n\nYou met other niggas while I'm wishin' I was with you\n\nAnd it kills me 'cause I know that I'm not\n\nI got to see you again, I just can't see you with him\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you, bitch I wrote this song for you\n\nI really hope you like it a lot\n\n\n\nI met a girl, she had me sprung, she on my tongue\n\nI taste that bitch\n\nI met a girl, we fell in love, then we broke up\n\nI hate that bitch\n\nI met a girl, she on my mind, like all the time\n\nErase that bitch\n\nI met a girl, we fell in love, then we broke up\n\nI hate that bitch\n\n\n\nTossin' and turnin' in your fragrance, perfect story rip the pages\n\nClean slade and you went and stained it, huh\n\nThis home that I bought and painted\n\nIs faded, this basement is dusty, ain't it\n\nThis pavement is cold as penguins, amazin'\n\nThe things you say just to let me know that it ain't the same\n\nI faced the face with a face that changed me in every way\n\nI hate to hate you but can't avoid it on shady days\n\nThose were your favorites we used to be playin' in the rain\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? Bitch I wrote this song for you\n\nI really hope you like it a lot\n\nYou met other niggas while I'm wishin' I was with you\n\nAnd it kills me cause I know that I'm not\n\nI got to see you again, I just can't see you with him\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? Bitch I wrote this song for you\n\nI really hope you like it a lot\n\n\n\nI met a girl, she had me sprung, she on my tongue\n\nI taste that bitch\n\nI met a girl, we fell in love, then we broke up\n\nI hate that bitch\n\nI met a girl, she on my mind, like all the time\n\nErase that bitch\n\nI met a girl, we fell in love, then we broke up\n\nI hate that bitch",
