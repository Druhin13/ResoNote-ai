  "lyrics": "You draw me in disguise\r\nAnd paint me paralyzed, it's true\r\nYou trace me as you see\r\nThe darkest color, deepest blue\r\nI'm heavy in this chair\r\nSharp corners frame my back\n\nWhile you draw me in disguise\n\nAnd paint me paralyzed, it's true\n\n\n\nWhen they come to find me\n\nThen please burn my body\n\nWhen they come to find me\n\nThen please burn my body\n\n\n\nA broad stroke extinguishes this fire\n\nPaint me screaming into the sprawl\n\nA broad stroke extinguishes this fire\n\nPaint me screaming into the sprawl\n\n\n\nI tried to draw you too\n\nBut in bad taste and with poor choice\n\nAnd I can't paint like you do\n\nTragic precision, perfect void\n\nI'm sleeping in this chair\n\nWhile you sleep in the hallway\n\nYou draw me in disguise\n\nAnd paint me paralyzed, it's true\n\n\n\nWhen they come to find me\n\nThen please burn my body\n\nWhen they come to find me\n\nThen please burn my body\n\n\n\nA broad stroke extinguishes this fire\n\nPaint me screaming into the sprawl\n\nA broad stroke extinguishes this fire\n\nPaint me screaming into the sprawl",
