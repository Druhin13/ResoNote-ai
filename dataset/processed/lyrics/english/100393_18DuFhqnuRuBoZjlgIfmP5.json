  "lyrics": "I used to live up in the projects, in a duplex\r\nEven a shotgun shack\r\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\r\nI used to be out on the block late night\r\nDark alleys with a pocket full of crack\r\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\nI had friends turned to foes, hid behind closed doors\n\nPlottin' on me for my stacks\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\n'Cause I've never been as blessed as I am right now\n\nAnd that's a mothafuckin' fact\n\nSo I'm never goin' back\n\n\n\nI lived more in one life than your whole family tree\n\nNow I'm ready to be the man that life demands me to be\n\nI'm down to take the wheel and drive so go on and hand me the key\n\nAnd when it's done everyone gon' really understand he's a G\n\nI'm never bitin' off more than I can chew\n\nAnd I tolerate you suckas even if I can't stand you\n\nNot only am I a man but I'm the band and a brand too\n\nSo I understand the kind of shit these haters can hand you\n\nI seen a lot of pain and struggle, hardships in my days (days)\n\nAnd the devil comin' at me all kind of fuckin' ways (ways)\n\nThere was plays when the lick went bad, we had to draw down No honor amongst thieves, they hate and bring the law down\n\nCutthroat savages, kill you and make sandwiches\n\nPromise this world got more drama than you can manage, shit\n\nSomehow I fought my way up out of the zoo\n\nThen turned around and said \"mother fuck you\"\n\n'Cause man I'm never goin' back\n\n\n\nI used to live up in the projects, in a duplex\n\nEven a shotgun shack\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\nI used to be out on the block late night\n\nDark alleys with a pocket full of crack\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\nI had friends turned to foes, hid behind closed doors\n\nPlottin' on me for my stacks\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\n'Cause I've never been as blessed as I am right now\n\nAnd that's a mothafuckin' fact\n\nSo I'm never goin' back\n\n\n\nStack proper, stat popper\n\nI just landed, in the black choppa\n\nAnd the chat stopper, pop-pop, strapped proper\n\nIn that black cabinet is the fat copper\n\nGive a little take and then what you got\n\nPockets gettin' raped, niggas gettin' shot\n\nThink 'cause we got cake, niggas gettin' soft\n\nAny disrespect, niggas gettin' boxed\n\nIf they bring that [?] niggas gettin' scoffed\n\nPull up like police, niggas gettin' stopped\n\nDrag him out the car, niggas gettin' chopped\n\nPunch him in the mouth, niggas gettin' socked\n\nEven when you're tryin' niggas never listen\n\nAlways kinda dissin', but you're never decent\n\nAnd we just moving different, so you're gettin' distant\n\nI'm just too persistent, but just got resisted\n\nGrab my little daughter and my son and kissed 'em\n\nNot a day goes by when I ain't tryin' to lift 'em\n\nThink a nigga stupid man I clocked the system\n\nBun just hit me up and then he got assistance\n\n\n\nI used to live up in the projects, in a duplex\n\nEven a shotgun shack\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\nI used to be out on the block late night\n\nDark alleys with a pocket full of crack\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\nI had friends turned to foes, hid behind closed doors\n\nPlottin' on me for my stacks\n\nAnd man I'm never goin' back\n\n'Cause I've never been as blessed as I am right now\n\nAnd that's a mothafuckin' fact\n\nSo I'm never goin' back",
