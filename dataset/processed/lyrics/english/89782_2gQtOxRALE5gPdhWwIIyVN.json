  "lyrics": "What do you call yourself, if anything?\r\nI do not care to call myself much of anything\r\nIf I had your dollar, I'll show you what I mean\r\nI'll show you what I mean\r\nI'll show you what I mean\r\nI'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean\n\n\n\nYou live out in the street in the open air?\n\nYes, I live out in the street, nature is everywhere\n\nIf I had your dollar, I'll take you anywhere\n\n\n\nIf I really did, what would you go and buy?\n\nNone of your business, but later I'd be high\n\nIf I had your dollar, you wouldn't wonder why\n\n\n\nIf you're so hard up, why not try to steal?\n\nRight now I'm sunbathing, perhaps later on I will\n\nIf I had your dollar, I'll show you how to feel\n\n\n\nAre you ashamed to beg, your youth in full power?\n\nPower corrupts, I'm building a cinnamon tower\n\nIf I had your dollar, I'll finish in the hour\n\n\n\nWhat would your mama say, seeing you this way?\n\nMy mama is a rose, my papa is today\n\nIf I had your dollar, I'll sing your blues away\n\n\n\nWhere next will you go, when the winter comes?\n\nOut to the open highway, but why not ask my thumbs?\n\nIf I had your dollar, I'll beat it like a drum\n\n\n\nDoes the devil ever come a-knocking on your sleeping bag?\n\nIf he ever does, I'll offer him a drag\n\nIf I had your dollar, you'll make my doggy wag\n\n\n\nWhat do you call yourself, if anything?\n\nI do not care to call myself much of anything\n\nIf I had your dollar, I'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean (Uh-huh)\n\nI'll show you what I mean (That's right)\n\nI'll show you what I mean\n\nI'll show you what I mean",
