  "lyrics": "Who we know, left untold\r\nBeaten by a broken dream\r\nNothing like what it used to be\r\nWe've been chasin' our demons down an empty road\r\nBeen watching our castle turnin' into dust\n\nEscapin' our shadows just to end up here once more\n\nAnd we both know\n\n\n\nThis is not the world we had in mind\n\nBut we kept turnin'\n\nWe are stuck on answers we can't find\n\nBut we kept turnin'\n\nAnd even though we might have lost our mind\n\nThe starlight reminds us of a different time\n\nThis is not the world we had in mind\n\nBut we kept turnin'\n\n\n\nBroken smile, tired eyes\n\nI can feel your longin' heart\n\nCall my name, howlin' from afar\n\n\n\nWe've been fightin' our demons just to stay afloat\n\nBeen buildin' a castle just to watch it fall\n\nBeen runnin' forever just to end up here once more\n\nAnd now we know\n\n\n\nThis is not the world we had in mind\n\nBut we kept turnin'\n\nWe are stuck on answers we can't find\n\nBut we kept turnin'\n\nAnd even though we might have lost our mind\n\nThe starlight reminds us of a different time\n\nThis is not the world we had in mind\n\nBut we kept turnin'\n\n\n\nTake me back\n\nBack to the mountainside\n\nUnder the northern lights\n\nChasin' the stars\n\n\n\nTake me back\n\nBack to the mountainside\n\nWhere we were full of life\n\nBack to the start\n\nWe both know that\n\n\n\nThis is not the world we had in mind\n\nBut we can't turn it\n\nWe are stuck on answers we can't find\n\nBut we can't turn it\n\nAnd even though we might have lost our mind\n\nThe starlight reminds us of a different time\n\nThis is not the world we had in mind\n\nBut we can't turn it",
