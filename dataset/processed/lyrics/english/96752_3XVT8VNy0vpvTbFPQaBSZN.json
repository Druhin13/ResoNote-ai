(Ayy, ayy)\n\n\n\nGoin' through the motions, I'm just tryna make it through\n\nHard to keep in touch when I'm always on the move\n\nYou tell me that you love me, I don't know what I would do\n\nIf you wasn't by my side, will I be able to move?\n\nGoin' through the motions, I'm just tryna make it through\n\nIt's hard to keep in touch when I'm always on the move\n\nYou tell me that you love me, I don't know what I would do\n\nIf you wasn't by my side, would I be able to move?\n\n\n\nBut it's okay...",
