  "lyrics": "You can't hide the pain,\r\nI can see it scrawled on your empty face.\r\nAnd I feel the hurt,\r\nIt's in the words you say, they make me want to...\r\nScream out to the world,\n\nFor taking life for granted and I know.\n\nYou are by my side when\n\nI turn to hear you cry,\n\n\n\nI am so afraid of living in oblivion\n\nI am so afraid of living in oblivion\n\n\n\nAm I so blind?\n\nWith my eyes turned to a different time or hour.\n\nAt the end of the day,\n\nWhen we both run down and our hopes are heavy...\n\n\n\nTell me what you will,\n\n'Cause I've got to know the truth inside of you.\n\nCan you hear what I say,\n\nWhen I hold you and you scorn the day?\n\n\n\nI am so afraid of living in oblivion\n\nI am so afraid of living in oblivion\n\n\n\nLiving in oblivion\n\nLiving in oblivion\n\n\n\nSo I ask again,\n\nAm I so alone and full of pride?\n\nTo never speak out...\n\nThis is my world, this is my world\n\n\n\nDon't tell me now,\n\nI won't feel those words, I won't feel the lies they tell\n\nCan you hear my scream?\n\nIt's for everyone, for everyone...\n\n\n\nI am so afraid of living in oblivion\n\nI am so afraid of living in oblivion\n\n\n\nLiving in oblivion\n\nLiving in oblivion\n\n\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la, in oblivion....",
