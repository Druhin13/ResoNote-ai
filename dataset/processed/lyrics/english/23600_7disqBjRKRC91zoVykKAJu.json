  "lyrics": "Hard to get, impossible to hold\r\nStraight and narrow like a burnin' fuse\r\nIn all cold dawn by the side of the road\r\nI hope this case, a perfect thing\r\nLove is (love is) what you want it to be\r\nLove is (love is) heaven to the lonely\n\nShow me what you wanted to do\n\nLove is what I got for you\n\nI close my eyes, search the stars\n\nCryin' for help, I wake up cold\n\nYou're in my system, under my skin\n\nThrow emotion, please don't fall\n\nLove is (love is) what you want it to be\n\nLove is (love is) heaven to the lonely\n\nShow me what you wanted to do\n\nLove is what I got for you\n\nCan't live on promises, won't sleep alight\n\nDon't understand a thing to say till I read 'em in your eyes\n\nGotta run on instinct, gotta go bob-bee-oh\n\nGotta touch for sandstep, now it is for real\n\nCan't live on promises, won't sleep alight\n\nDon't understand a thing to say till I read 'em in your eyes\n\nGotta run on instinct, gotta go bob-bee-oh\n\nGotta touch for sandstep\n\nLove is (love is) what you want it to be\n\nLove is (love is) heaven to the lonely\n\nShow me what you wanted to do\n\nLove is what I got for you\n\nLove is (love is) huh\n\n(Love is)\n\nLove is (Show me)",
