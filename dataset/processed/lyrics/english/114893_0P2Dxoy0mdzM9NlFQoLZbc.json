Oh, we're making the day\n\nCome and fight with this, Hollywood, nigga won't survive this shit\n\nI do that, did that, blow your fuckin' wig back\n\nForreal-a, gorilla, who loves goin' bareback\n\nThey wanna eye me down, tie me down, lock me up\n\nBut I'm a lion in the dog pound\n\nNow, how that sound?\n\n\n\nHollywood is alright\n\nHollywood is fragrant\n\nJealousy is gunfire\n\nIt makes you kill the vibe\n\n(She's a wonderful thing)\n\nJealousy and dark times\n\nSinking on the web\n\nThere’s more to love than that\n\nJealousy is vibe down\n\nJealousy is vibe down\n\n\n\nShe's just what I need\n\nAnd it's a wonderful thing\n\nIn this city of dreams\n\nAnd it's a wonderful thing\n\nYou knows how to ride me\n\n(And it's a wonderful thing)\n\nYou knows how to excite me\n\n(And it's a wonderful thing)\n\n\n\nShe's a wonderful thing\n\nShe's a wonderful thing",
