A bee dipped in brass\n\nI'm stuck on the isthmus connecting my past\n\nA passionate servant when I'm paid in cash\n\nDon't ask if it's worth it. Don't think bout the math\n\n\n\nThere's no complaining in the mansion\n\nYou can't just do what I do\n\nI chuck my brain through the black\n\nClimb up the tree\n\nShoot out the cannon\n\nFuck her cause she reads\n\n\n\nPunctuation violation perpetrator is verified\n\nHa ha ha ha\n\n\n\nWanted you to know\n\nI came close to being another echo\n\nDon't have a soul\n\nBut I'm on a roll\n\n\n\nComfort in the words of a swindler\n\nEverybody needs approval\n\nOne love in the holes of a savior\n\n\n\nAct like you're above them\n\nAll the lives you're running\n\nWill you ever feel it again?\n\nLike you're part of something\n\n\n\nWorth fighting for\n\nWorth dying for\n\n\n\nFlunked out and flung from the front of your face wait\n\nI smell Sharon's pimple, it's the size of grapes\n\nI'm so splintered that my mind waved back\n\nI had cash but sold it for some soul I'm da wraith",
