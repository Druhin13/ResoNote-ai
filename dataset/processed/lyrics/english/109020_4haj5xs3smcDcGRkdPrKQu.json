  "lyrics": "On the other side of a street I knew\r\nStood a girl that looked like you\r\nI guess that's deja vu\r\nBut I thought this can't be true\r\nCause you moved to west L.A or New York or Santa Fe\r\nOr where ever to get away from me\n\n\n\nOh but that one night\n\nWas more than just right\n\nI didn't leave you cause I was all through\n\nOh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell\n\nBecause I really fell for you\n\n\n\nOh I swear to ya\n\nI'll be there for ya\n\nThis is not a drive by\n\nJust a shy guy looking for a two ply\n\nHefty bag to hold my love\n\nWhen you move me everything is groovy\n\nThey don't like it sue me\n\nThe way you do me\n\nOh I swear to ya\n\nI'll be there for ya\n\nThis is not a drive by\n\n\n\nOn the other side of a downward spiral\n\nMy love for you went viral\n\nAnd I loved you every mile you drove away\n\nBut now here you are again\n\nSo let's skip the \"how you been\"\n\nAnd get down to the \"more than friends\" at last\n\n\n\nOh but that one night\n\nIs still the highlight\n\nI didn't leave you until I came to\n\nOh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell\n\nBecause I really fell for you\n\n\n\nOh I swear to ya\n\nI'll be there for ya\n\nThis is not a drive by\n\nJust a shy guy looking for a 2 ply\n\nHefty bag to hold my love\n\nWhen you move me everything is groovy\n\nThey don't like it sue me\n\nThe way you do me\n\nOh I swear to ya\n\nI'll be there for ya\n\nThis is not a drive by\n\n\n\nPlease believe that when I leave\n\nThere's nothing up my sleeve but love for you\n\nAnd a little time to get my head together too\n\n\n\nOn the other side of a street I knew\n\nStood a girl that looked like you\n\nThis must be deja vu\n\nBut I thought this can't be true\n\nCause\n\n\n\nOh I swear to ya\n\nI'll be there for ya\n\nThis is not a drive by\n\nJust a shy guy looking for a two ply\n\nHefty bag to hold my love\n\nWhen you move me everything is groovy\n\nThey don't like it sue me\n\nThe way you do me\n\nOh I swear to ya\n\nI'll be there for ya\n\nThis is not a drive by",
