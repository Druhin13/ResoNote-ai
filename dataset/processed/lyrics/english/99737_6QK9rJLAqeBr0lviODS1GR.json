  "lyrics": "All I have to do is look at you\r\nAnd I'm scared to tell\r\nScared of the way that you kill me with only your eyes\r\nYou're the only one I've ever known to do what you do\r\nStrip me of why I was numb and bring me through life\n\nI feel like losing all control\n\nYou are the half that makes me whole\n\n\n\nI'll fill this house with things I never said\n\nI'll be right here when you come back from the dead\n\nI'll never [?] again\n\n\n\nI don't know what's holding me back\n\nI need to react\n\nI just need you\n\nIf you come closer I'm going to rip you apart\n\nEverything I feel is real\n\nYou were meant for me\n\nDig up the past, scream as you bury my heart\n\n\n\nThe only thing that really matters\n\nIs what you wanted more\n\nI'm losing all control\n\nYou are the half that makes me whole\n\n\n\nI'll fill this house with things I never said\n\nI'll be right here when you come back from the dead\n\nI'll show you just how much you mean to me\n\nI'll break you down then let you break me\n\nI'll never [?] again\n\n\n\nYou drive me fucking insane\n\nI just wanna be everything inside the same\n\nI just want to taste you and fuck you and be you and love you\n\nEat you alive\n\nI feel like...\n\n\n\nLosing all control\n\nYou are the half that makes me whole\n\n\n\nI'll fill this house with things I never said\n\nI'll be right here when you come back from the dead\n\nI'll show you just how much you mean to me\n\nI'll break you down then let you break me\n\nI'll never [?] again",
