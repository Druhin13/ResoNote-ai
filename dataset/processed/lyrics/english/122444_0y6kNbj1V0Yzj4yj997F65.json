  "lyrics": "You could call me irregular\r\nI'm a basic fix for a better man\r\nSeasons change I'm a maniac\r\nFor a better known with a bitter end\r\nIf you say you're a chicken now you can live it down\r\nWe can light the whole thing up\n\n\n\nAll the parts that you're fucking with like a tourniquet\n\nI can light the whole thing up\n\n\n\nYou can say I'm a stranger now\n\nWith some falling down we can get it straight\n\nHazy days in suburbia\n\nAt your father's house we self medicate\n\nIntertwined in my urgency\n\nIt's so new to me\n\nI can light the whole thing up\n\n\n\nNothing else been impressing me but I gotta see\n\nI can light the whole thing up\n\n\n\nBurn the room\n\nOh, I hear it so well\n\nOver soon\n\nOh, I hear it now\n\n\n\nHonest to god\n\nI really couldn't lie to your face\n\nI look away and feel like a mess\n\nBecause what I can't accept\n\nIs the truth that I don't love you\n\nWish I could say I was a better friend to you then\n\nI'm fucking sorry\n\nI wish I could say I was a better friend to you then\n\nI'm fucking sorry\n\nOnce in a while\n\nI will remember everything good\n\nOnce in a while\n\n\n\nBurn the room\n\nFeel the gloom now\n\nOver soon\n\nI feel the gloom now",
