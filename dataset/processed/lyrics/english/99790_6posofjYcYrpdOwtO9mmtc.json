  "lyrics": "Why don't you stay here? I wanna spend some time\r\nWhy don't you lay here? Make the full moon cry\r\nWhy don't you love me the way I want you to?\r\nYou cut up the best dress I ever bought for you\r\nBut you don't have to doubt or figure me out\n\nLet me show you the way it's gonna be\n\nYou don't have to doubt what it's all about\n\nSee the light that leads you here, we can find a way\n\n\n\nI want you to be there all the time\n\nI want you to be there when I die\n\nI want you, you, just don't ask why\n\nI want you, you, all the time\n\nI want you\n\n\n\nYour scent brings me flowers, your heart, it brings me wine\n\nAll of these hours, I wanna do that time\n\nYour love is such hardship, but work I'm pleased to do\n\nAnd my back is breaking, fire I'll walk through\n\n\n\nYou don't have to doubt or figure it out\n\nSee the light that leads you here, we can find a way\n\n\n\nI want you to be there all the time\n\nI want you to be there when I die\n\nI want you, you, just don't ask why\n\nI want you, you, all the time\n\nI want you\n\n\n\nWe don't need the seas to separate\n\nNo regret\n\nSee the storm in you against your own\n\nCigarette\n\n\n\nAnd you don't have to doubt what it's all about\n\nDarkness coming down, night is all around\n\n\n\nI want you to be there all the time\n\nI want you to be there when I die\n\nI want you, you, just don't ask why\n\nI want you, you, all the time\n\nI want you to be there all the time\n\nI want you to be there when I die\n\nI want you, you, just don't ask why\n\nI want you, you, all the time\n\nI want you",
