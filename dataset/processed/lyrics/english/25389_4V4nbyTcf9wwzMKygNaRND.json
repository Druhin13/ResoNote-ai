  "lyrics": "She don't wanna go it alone\r\nBut her mind has a mind of its own\r\nA broken heart, skin and bone\r\nTrying to swim but she sinks like a stone\r\nShe's got nowhere to go\n\nBut she can't go home\n\n\n\nShelter\n\nWell she's just looking for shelter\n\nWell she's been out in the cold\n\nLooking for someone to hold\n\nRunning for cover\n\nJust needs somebody to love her\n\nTurn a hurricane into a drop of rain\n\nSomebody to help her\n\nShe's just looking for shelter\n\n\n\nShe been talking trouble to strangers\n\nHoping to find her an angel\n\nHiding in the shadows waiting for a light\n\nMaybe there's somebody gonna save her tonight\n\n\n\nIt's hard to find your way home\n\nWhen it's not your own\n\n\n\nShelter\n\nWell she's just looking for shelter\n\nWell she's been out in the cold\n\nLooking for someone to hold\n\nRunning for cover\n\nJust needs somebody to love her\n\nTurn a hurricane into a drop of rain\n\nSomebody to help her\n\nShe's just looking for shelter\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\nOoh\n\nHey, hey, hey\n\n\n\nAw, she can be [?]\n\nYour towering house since the day she was born\n\nToo young to be [?]\n\nTorn from the page of an old [?] song\n\nShe's walking the line but she's walking it wrong\n\n\n\nShelter\n\nWell she's just looking for shelter\n\nShe's been out in the cold\n\nLooking for someone to hold\n\nRunning for cover\n\nJust needs somebody to love her\n\nTurn a hurricane into a drop of rain\n\nSomebody to help her\n\nOh she's just looking for shelter\n\nWe're all looking for shelter\n\nWe're all looking for shelter, ooh\n\nYeah she's just looking for shelter\n\nBaby we're all looking for shelter\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nWoo!",
