  "lyrics": "Pressure to party, gonna stay in\r\nNothing good can come from me drinking\r\nI would run, shoes off, straight back to you\r\nI know where you live, I used to live there too\r\nPressure to feel fine after the fact\r\nOut on the dance floor with my body back\n\nMeeting a stranger, touching his face\n\nI don't want anyone to ever take your place\n\nPressure to go strike out on your own\n\nPressure to learn from being alone\n\nPressure to not leave it for too long\n\nBefore you find another heart where you belong\n\nPressure to come up with conversation\n\nMakes the family fine with my isolation\n\n\n\nI know I've locked myself in my room\n\nBut I’ll open up the door and try to love again soon\n\nTry to love again soon\n\nTry to love again soon\n\nTry to love again soon\n\n\n\nPressure to act the right way around him\n\nWe're both in a crowd with people surrounding us\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nDon't know how it works\n\nPressure to not let the inside of my mind\n\nSpill onto the floor for our friends to find\n\nAnd, oh, what do I do?\n\n'Cause God how it hurts\n\nPressure to come up with reasons why\n\nSometimes it might look to you like I’m not even trying\n\n\n\nI know I've locked myself in my room\n\nBut I'll open up the door and try to love again soon\n\nTry to love again soon\n\nTry to love again soon\n\nTry to love again soon",
