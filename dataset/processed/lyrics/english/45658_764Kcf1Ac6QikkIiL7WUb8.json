  "lyrics": "Baby, last night was hands down\r\nOne of the best nights\r\nThat I've had no doubt\r\nBetween the bottle of wine\r\nAnd the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye\n\nThen we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain\n\nAnd I know that I can't ever tell you enough\n\nThat all I need in this life is your crazy love\n\nIf I never get to see the Northern lights\n\nOr if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night\n\nOh, if all I got is your hand in my hand\n\nBaby, I could die a happy man\n\nHappy man, baby\n\nMmm\n\nBaby, that red dress brings me to my knees\n\nOh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe\n\nYou're a saint, you're a Goddess,\n\nThe cutest, the hottest,\n\nA masterpiece\n\nIt's too good to be true,\n\nNothing better than you\n\nIn my wildest dreams\n\nAnd I know that I can't ever tell you enough\n\nThat all I need in this life is your crazy love\n\nIf I never get to see the Northern lights\n\nOr if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night\n\nOh, if all I got is your hand in my hand\n\nBaby, I could die a happy man, yeah\n\nI don't need no vacation,\n\nNo fancy destination\n\nBaby, you're my great escape\n\nWe could stay at home,\n\nListen to the radio\n\nOr dance around the fireplace\n\nAnd if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia\n\nOr drive a sports car up the coast of California\n\nOh, if all I got is your hand in my hand\n\nBaby, I could die a happy man\n\nBaby, I could die a happy man\n\nOh, I could die a happy man\n\nYou know I could girl\n\nI could die, I could die a happy man",
