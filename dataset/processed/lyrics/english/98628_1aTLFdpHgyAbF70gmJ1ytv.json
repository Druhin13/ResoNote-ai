  "lyrics": "The miles I’ve traveled now seem like withered time; fixated on the rear view when I can’t see ahead\r\nFor me to view a reflection without corruption so a past won’t dictate a present\r\nMonths pass, sitting still, thinking in this box where my thoughts are not friendly, nor hopeful\r\nThis weak mind and body crumble\r\nWho we were will never be the same\n\nWe'll never relive the feeling\n\nLove we made, we let it slip away, and I just can't face it\n\n\n\nI can feel it coming on, living inside,calling me right back to you\n\nMy regret meets no resistance, and I endorse this torment to feel\n\nIf you exhaust a heart of love, is the pumping of blood still enough Do the limbs go numb\n\n\n\nWho we were will never be the same\n\nWe'll never relive the feeling\n\nLove we made, we let it slip away, and I just can't face it\n\nWho we were will never be the same\n\nWe'll never relive the feeling\n\nLove we made, we let it slip away, and I just can't face it\n\n\n\nMy fictional friend, conducting me piece by piece, I feel your cold\n\nBlank stare cast on me\n\nI don’t ask to be mended, just understand my words and hear me out:\n\nAll the passion has faded; all the fire has burned out\n\n\n\nHow could I see it coming; this electrifying high that we would grow to resent\n\n\n\nI can feel it coming on, living inside, calling me right back to\n\nYou",
