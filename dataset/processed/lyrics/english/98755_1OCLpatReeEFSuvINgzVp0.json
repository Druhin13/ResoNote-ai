  "lyrics": "Woke a dog from a running dream\r\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\r\nAte a black fly in the cream\r\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)\r\nChipped my tooth on an engagement ring\r\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nCould have stopped any one of these things\n\nBut that would have been bad luck\n\n\n\nAre you tired of things going right?\n\nThings going wrong?\n\nTired of trying to make everyone happy?\n\nToo tired to sing your own songs\n\n\n\nDo you wish you could stop everything\n\nAnd take back your love?\n\nAre you sorry you gave it up so easy?\n\nDo you cry like you're trying to be born?\n\n\n\nWoke a dog from a running dream\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nAte a black fly in the cream\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)\n\nChipped my tooth on an engagement ring\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nCould have stopped any one of these things\n\nBut that would have been bad luck\n\n\n\nSo I died and went to work\n\nSo I died and went to work\n\nIt's not as bad as I thought it would be\n\nBut it's still pretty bad luck\n\nIt's not as bad as I thought it would be\n\nBut it's still pretty bad luck\n\n\n\nWoke a dog from a running dream\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nAte a black fly in the cream\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)\n\nChipped my tooth on an engagement ring\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nCould have stopped any one of these things\n\nBut that would have been bad luck\n\n\n\nAnd love, the most contrary asset of them all\n\nDragging in on nature's coattails\n\nActing like it wrote the moon\n\nTrying to pass riddles as poetry\n\nEmbargo is love's waiting room\n\nAnd meantime, right here in human time\n\nMy heart could break for a one-legged seagull\n\nAnd still afford nothing to you (That's bad luck)\n\n\n\nAre you tired of things going right?\n\nThings going wrong?\n\nTired of trying to make everyone happy?\n\nToo tired to sing your own songs\n\n\n\nWoke a dog from a running dream\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nAte a black fly in the cream\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad, bad luck)\n\nChipped my tooth on an engagement ring\n\nAnd that's bad luck (Bad luck)\n\nCould have stopped any one of these things\n\nBut that would have been bad luck\n\n\n\nSo I died and went to work\n\nSo I died and went to work\n\nSo I died and went to work\n\nSo I died and went to work",
