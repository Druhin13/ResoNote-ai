  "lyrics": "It was still dark when Mark arrived\r\nMaybe 6:45 in the morning time\r\nIn the tenth grade, we was tight friends\r\nBut neither of us had a driver's license\r\nHis mom was a flight attendant\r\nAnd she'd leave town with a Cadillac unattended\n\nSo we used to get tempted,\n\nThat intense tendency to tend to what we wasn't meant to\n\nWe would skip out on class and shit\n\nTo go visit other schools, just tryin to act cool\n\nAnd looking back I have to laugh at it\n\nCause all we did was burn up gas and flunk math fool\n\nBut still it was super ill,\n\nI mean two teenagers in a new Seville\n\nWith 1987 in the tapedeck\n\nThat was a part of my life that I'll never forget\n\nIt went...\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n\n\nThe soundtrack still runs through my head\n\nI gotta keep every single step\n\nAs old as we get, we don't forget\n\nWe won't forget\n\nWe don't forget\n\n\n\nAnd you can't tell me nothing about frontin\n\nWe wasn't even sixteen yet, come on jump in\n\nCruise control until we lose control\n\nMax the low end out to let it bruise my soul\n\nAnd god knows I should have been studying\n\nSo maybe I could grow up and be somebody\n\nBut I loved the looks that the girls shot at me from the bus stop\n\nWhen we pulled up in that caddy\n\nGood thing back then I had bad game\n\nOtherwise there probably be a few with my last name\n\nBetter that my true love was rap\n\nNow let it out on reverse, until the bad dub snaps\n\nFelt so right, forgot we was wrong\n\nSittin at a stop light, singin along\n\nWhen I look in my rearview now, what would I see\n\nIf I didn't have the music in my history, now give it to me\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n\n\nAnd we was just a couple of kids\n\nIt was right around the same time that nobody was beatin the biz\n\nHad that, and I know you got soul\n\nOn a tape that I made, recorded em off a [?] show\n\nI was addicted to the radio\n\nMake my request, and wait for it\n\nHoldin my finger on the pause button, like \"now go\"\n\nI guess that was the original download\n\nRap videos and girls digits\n\nA fifteen pack of blank cassettes for Christmas\n\nUsed to steal mom's change if it's easy to\n\nWe used to make up names for our graffiti crew\n\nUsed to talk about makin it big\n\nAnd if we ever got rich, the way we would live\n\nHey Mark, we ain't there yet but\n\nIf you can hear my voice then turn your stereo up, like what...\n\n\n\n[Chorus x2]",
