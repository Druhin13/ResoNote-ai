  "lyrics": "We've built it up just to fall apart\r\nTry to leave them wanting more\r\nAs we scream and we fight, carry on through the night\r\nBut the problem is never the cure\r\nEvery day we try to be better than the lies and the sins\r\nI will love all the hate, feel like one in the same\n\nI only sink before I swim\n\n\n\nI swear this time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\nThis time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\n\n\nI'll forget all the dreams that we told our hearts\n\nAnd the pain that's there to start\n\nTry to find what is safe from the scars that replace\n\nLike a faithful that converts\n\n\n\nI swear this time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\nThis time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\nI'm standing ground\n\nWe sing it out\n\nThe legion of the underground\n\nThis time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\n\n\nKeeps pulling me under\n\nWhen the waves come down\n\nI can't come up for air\n\nKeeps pulling me under\n\nWhen I close my eyes\n\nIt's all that I can bear\n\nKeeps pulling me under\n\nLet the rain come down\n\nAnd wash away the fear\n\nKeeps pulling me under\n\nLet the rain come down\n\nAnd wash away, wash away the fear\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nI swear this time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\nThis time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one\n\nI'm standing ground\n\nWe sing it out\n\nThe legion of the underground\n\nThis time is gonna be the last one\n\nGonna be the last one",
