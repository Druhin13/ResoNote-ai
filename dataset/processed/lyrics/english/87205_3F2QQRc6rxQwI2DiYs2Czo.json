  "lyrics": "Come on - Joey get out of school\rWe got places to go\rA '57 Lincoln you got a radio that hurts\rAnd the girls like to touch it\rJust to find out if it works\rBut don't look at me\rIt wasn't me\rJoey live on the edge of the corner\rOf living on the run\rI like to ride in the middle\rI'm just tryin to have some fun\rUntil the Pirates come\rAnd take me\rAnd I won't need a pilot\rGot a pirate who might sail\rSomewhere I heard far away\rYou answer me\rSo i'm holding on\rTo your rainbow sleeves\rWell, goodbye boys, Oh my buddy boys,\rOh my sad-eyed Sinatras\rIt'as a cold globe around the sea\rYou keep the shirt that I bought ya\rAnd I know you'll get the chance to make it\rAnd nothin's gonna stop you\rYou just reach right out and take it\rYou say - So long, lonely Avenue\rSo long lonely avenue\rI'll see you there\rWait 'n see\rBe lookin' for me\rJust like you\rJust like me",
