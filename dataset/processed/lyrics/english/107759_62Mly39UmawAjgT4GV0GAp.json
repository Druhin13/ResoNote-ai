  "lyrics": "It is better to light just one little candle\r\nThan to stumble in the dark.\r\nBetter far that you light just one little candle,\r\nAll you need is a tiny spark.\r\nIf we'd all say a prayer that the world would be free,\r\nA wonderful dawn of a new day we'd see...\n\nAnd if everyone lit just one little candle,\n\nWhat a bright world this would be.\n\n\n\nWhen the day is dark and dreary\n\nAnd we know not where to go;\n\nDon't let your heart go weary,\n\nJust keep this thought in mind...\n\n\n\nIt is better to light just one little candle\n\nThan to stumble in the dark.\n\nBetter far that you light just one little candle,\n\nAll you need is a tiny spark.\n\nIf we'd all say a prayer that the world would be free,\n\nA wonderful dawn of a new day we'd see...\n\nAnd if everyone lit just one little candle,\n\nWhat a bright world this would be",
