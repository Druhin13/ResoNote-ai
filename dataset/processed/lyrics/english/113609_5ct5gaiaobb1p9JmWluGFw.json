  "lyrics": "I sat round all day\r\nI used to get stoned\r\nI liked to get wasted\r\nBut these days I don‘t\r\n'Cause I'm happy with you\r\nI got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah\n\n\n\nI walked around angry\n\nI used to feel bad\n\nBut nowadays my days\n\nDon‘t have to be sad\n\n'Cause I'm happy, with you\n\nI got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah\n\n\n\nLike, hear the high clear robin sing\n\nWalk a bluebell carpet\n\nWatch the children playing games\n\nCatch a moon and then drop it\n\nHear the gentle mantle roll\n\nOn a frosty morning\n\nSee the mighty ocean break\n\nLike a sailor's warning\n\n\n\nI used to drink too much\n\nForgot to come home\n\nI lied to my doctor\n\nBut these days I don't\n\n'Cause I'm happy with you\n\nI got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah\n\n\n\nThrow a pocketful of coins in the Trevi fountain\n\nSee an ice cold running stream\n\nRushing down the mountain\n\nHear a new born baby lamb\n\nCalling for its mother\n\nWatching reunited friends\n\nLoving one another\n\n\n\nI sat round all day\n\nI liked to get stoned\n\nI used to get wasted\n\nBut these days I don‘t\n\n'Cause I'm happy with you\n\nI got lots of good things to do, ooh yeah\n\n\n\nHappy with you\n\nI'm happy with you\n\nHappy with you",
