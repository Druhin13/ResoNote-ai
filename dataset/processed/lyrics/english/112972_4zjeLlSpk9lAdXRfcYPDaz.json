Another motivational quote\n\nWhile these niggas going through phases\n\nI never mutated or deviated from the life or mission statement\n\nThis is preservation of the vibe\n\nNever let them forget the time\n\nWell they say you was a rapper\n\nYou fasho had to know how to rhyme\n\nI keep my passport close, 'cause it eases my mind\n\n(eases my mind)\n\n\n\nIt's a shame what they did to it\n\nNow the rap just don't go that same route\n\nWhen they take rawness away, just\n\nJust they make it too pretty\n\n\n\nI'm feelin' trapped on this revolvin' land mine\n\nThat could blow at any minute\n\nSaturday night special with one bullet in the chamber\n\nAnd six cylnders spinnin'\n\nRussian Roulette, the American Dream could be your death\n\nOr it could be everything\n\n\n\nIt's M.O.B. everything\n\nBack in '03 had Gucci seats, I put Gs on everything\n\nMade matrimony with this game\n\nI got cocaine when it rains\n\nThem niggas taxin' for the nina\n\nThey want like ten and some change\n\nI got my tears and my pain\n\nI got my balls and my girl\n\nAnd I ain't breakin' that shit for a nigga or bitch\n\nThat shit is absurd\n\nI'm controversial with these verbs\n\nLike Christopher Wallace with words\n\nFelix Mitchell with birds\n\nMalcolm X with the perm\n\nNigga\n\n\n\nFreddie Gibbs; I heard the name, but I didn't know\n\nLike, I didn't know how good he was\n\nIt was after the photoshoot\n\nAfter I had already shook hands with him and met him\n\nI told him this when I seen him again, too, out in LA\n\nI was like, yo, I was like, yo, I ain't even know, like, you really good\n\n\n\nYeah\n\nBitch hit my line said she wanna go eat and drink and smoke and shit (Goofy bitch)\n\nBefore I hung up, I said call me when you want some dick\n\n(Want some dick)\n\nI'll never go broke in this game\n\nI'll charge it on a bitch (Charge it on a bitch)\n\nSo, my family and my kids will never want for shit\n\nStuck in a cell with no windows but I got a pot to piss\n\nSmokin' that dope on a daily\n\nFucked up the probation, I gotta go drop some piss\n\nHope in a truck, and I throw on that Twista\n\nAdrenaline Rush on some mobster shit\n\nEven when niggas was broke\n\nWe made it look rich, bitch, I'ma optimist\n\nMy presence'll fuck up your confidence\n\nFreaky bitches, I'm they confidant\n\nTrappin' out of muh fuckas rappers, slappin' these Poppadoc\n\nRZA with the zippers, official men chop it off the block\n\nOnce I made an M, I ain't give a fuck if I popped or not\n\nAnd I can't swim, a nigga ain't never had dreams of coppin' yachts\n\nBut I kowabunga, servin' that pussy at a thousand knots\n\nRest in peace to Ruck, tell Jesus I need a billion bucks\n\nGoon with the balloon, ain't no helium, but I sealed him up\n\nFeel the rush",
