  "lyrics": "Every step of the way\rWe walk the line\rYour days are numbered\rSo are mine\rTime is piling up\rWe struggle and we scrape\rAll boxed in\rNowhere to escape\rThe city's just a jungle\rMore games to play\rI'm trapped in the heart of it\rTrying to get away\rI was raised in the country\rBeen working in the town\rI been in trouble since I\rSet my suitcase down\rI ain't got nothing for you\rI had nothing before\rDon't even have anything\rFor myself anymore\rSky's full of fire\rAnd the rain is pouring down\rThere's nothing you can sell me\rSo I'll see you around\rAll my powers of expression\rAnd thoughts so sublime\rCould never do you justice\rReason or rhyme\rThere's only one thing that I did wrong\rI stayed in Mississippi a day too long\rThe devil's in the alley, the mule kickin' in the stall\rSay anything you wanna, I've heard it all\rI was thinking about the things that you said\rI was dreaming I was sleeping in your bed\rWalking through the leaves, falling from the trees\rFeel like a stranger nobody sees\rSo many things we never will undo\rI know you're sorry, well I'm sorry too\rSome people will offer you their hand and some won't\rLast night I knew you, tonight I don't\rI need something strong to distract my mind\rI'm gonna look at you 'til my eyes go blind\rWell I got here, following the southern star\rI crossed that river just to be where you are\rThere's only one thing that I did wrong\rI stayed in Mississippi a day too long\rWell my ship's been split to splinters; it's sinking fast\rI'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past\rBut my heart is not weary, and smiling's free\rI've got nothing but affection for those who've sailed with me\rEverybody's moving if they ain't already there\rEverybody's got to move somewhere\rWell stick with me baby anyhow\rThings should start to get interesting right about now\rMy clothes are wet, tight on my skin\rNot as tight as the corner that I painted myself in\rI know that fortune is waiting to be kind\rSo give me your hand and say you'll be mine\rThe emptiness is endless, gold is gray\rYou can always go back, but you can't go back all the way\rWell there's only one thing that I did wrong\rI stayed in Mississippi a day too long\rYeah the only thing that I did wrong\rWas stayed in Mississippi a day too long\rThe only thing that I did wrong\rWas stayed in Mississippi a day too long",
