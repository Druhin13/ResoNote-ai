  "lyrics": "Let’s see the night to the morning, either your place or mine\r\nOn my walls I got drawings of Bowie and the Hollywood sign\r\nI’ve never felt this emotion, you’ve opened up my eyes\r\nOh why, I didn’t realize\r\nI didn’t think I need you, need you\n\nBut now I know I need you, need you\n\nDidn’t think I’d end up sleepless on this phone all night\n\nEvery time I see you, see you it hits me even deeper, deeper\n\nIt’s almost like I’m dreaming, dreaming and it’s feeling like\n\n\n\nL O V E, I’m into you, you’re into me\n\nL O V E, it could be that easy\n\nL O V E, give into you, give into me\n\nT R U S T, it could be that easy\n\n\n\nEasy, easy, it could be that easy\n\nL O V E, T R U S T, it could be that easy\n\n\n\nWe were just two people in the right place, right time\n\nWe didn’t know we’d be under control when the lightning strikes\n\nAnd when it did, then it hit, like a brick falling from the sky\n\nAll mine, till the day I die\n\n\n\nI didn’t think I need you, need you\n\nBut now I know I need you, need you\n\nDidn’t think I’d end up sleepless on this phone all night\n\nEvery time I see you, see you it hits me even deeper, deeper\n\nIt’s almost like I’m dreaming, dreaming and it’s feeling like\n\n\n\nL O V E, I’m into you, you’re into me\n\nL O V E, it could be that easy\n\nL O V E, give into you, give into me\n\nT R U S T, it could be that easy\n\n\n\nEasy, easy, it could be that easy\n\nGimme a L, gimme an O, gimme a V - E\n\nT R U S T, it could be that easy\n\n\n\nL O V E\n\nL O V E I’m into you, you’re into me\n\nL O V E, give into you, give into me\n\nT R U S T, it could be that easy\n\n\n\nGimme a L, gimme an O, gimme a V - E\n\nT R U S T, it could be that easy\n\n\n\nGive me a C (C)\n\nGive me a A (A)\n\nGive me a T (T)\n\nWhat does that spell?
