  "lyrics": "All I need is a circle I can trust\r\nWhoever these open eyes should see\r\nKiss me more than just a reason to show I'm fine\r\nI never had a reason to waste my time\r\nAnd I'm open to the thought of getting by\n\nBut then she goes, she goes by\n\nIn the corner of the sky\n\nLike a seagull, she flies high\n\n'Cause she's always on my mind\n\n\n\nWhat if I could be somebody else?\n\n'Cause lately I've been thinking way too much\n\nI was hoping you could take me away for good\n\nI never had a reason to say I should\n\nBut I'm open to the thought of getting by\n\n\n\nBut then she goes, she goes by\n\nIn the corner of the sky\n\nLike a seagull, she flies high\n\n'Cause she's always on my mind",
