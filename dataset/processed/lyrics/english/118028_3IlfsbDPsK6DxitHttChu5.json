  "lyrics": "Everybody's got their demons\r\nEven wide awake or dreaming\r\nI'm the one who ends up leaving\r\nMake it okay\r\nSee a war, I wanna fight it\r\nSee a match, I wanna strike it\n\nEvery fire I've ignited\n\nFaded to grey\n\n\n\nBut now that I'm broken\n\nNow that you know it\n\nCaught up in a moment\n\nCan you see inside?\n\n\n\n'Cause I've got a jet black heart\n\nAnd there's a hurricane underneath it\n\nTrying to keep us apart\n\nI write with a poison pen\n\nBut these chemicals moving between us\n\nAre the reason to start again\n\n\n\nNow I'm holding on for dear life\n\nThere's no way that we could rewind\n\nMaybe there's nothing after midnight\n\nThat could make you stay\n\n\n\nBut now that I'm broken\n\nAnd now that you know it\n\nCaught up in a moment\n\nCan you see inside?\n\n\n\n'Cause I've got a jet black heart\n\nAnd there's a hurricane underneath it\n\nTrying to keep us apart\n\nI write with a poison pen\n\nBut these chemicals moving between us\n\nAre the reason to start again\n\n\n\nThe blood in my veins is made up of mistakes\n\nLet's forget who we are and dive into the dark\n\nAs we burst into color, returning to life\n\n\n\n'Cause I've got a jet black heart\n\nAnd there's a hurricane underneath it\n\nTrying to keep us apart\n\nI write with a poison pen\n\nBut these chemicals moving between us\n\nAre the reason to start again\n\n\n\n(The blood in my veins \n\nIs made up of mistakes) To start again\n\n(Let's forget who we are \n\nAnd dive into the dark)",
