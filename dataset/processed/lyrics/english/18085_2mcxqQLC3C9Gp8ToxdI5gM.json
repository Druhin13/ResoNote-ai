  "lyrics": "So I sat with my head in my hands\r\nAnd they started to rust\r\nAnd my legs, as I tried to stand\r\nHad turned into mush\r\nI got sick\r\nI got tired\n\nI felt crushed\n\nAnd I suffered a lot\n\nBut I drew a big line in the dust\n\nFor you just to (just to) not cross\n\n\n\nBut if you talk about a dream enough it might come true\n\n\n\nFall into the void, it's mesmerizing (whoa oh oh)\n\nCaptivated minds are sympathizing (whoa whoa)\n\nWaiting on a sun that's never rising (whoa oh oh)\n\nBlack, black sky is hypnotizing (whoa)\n\n\n\nWell I thought that I was a man\n\nWho would follow my own road\n\nThough I turned my back to you\n\nSo you'd follow your own\n\nSo long, my friend, goodbye\n\nSee you later (later) I guess\n\nGet gone, get lost, awhile\n\nI wish you (wish you) all the best\n\n\n\nBut if you talk about a dream enough it might come true\n\n\n\nFall into the void, it's mesmerizing (whoa oh oh)\n\nCaptivated minds are sympathizing (whoa whoa)\n\nWaiting on a sun that's never rising (whoa oh oh)\n\nBlack, black sky is hypnotizing (whoa)\n\n\n\nI'm not getting bored, I'm just impatient\n\nWatching your emotional immolation\n\nSmile and take a bow to the ovation\n\nFade to black and change the station\n\n\n\nFall into the void, it's mesmerizing (whoa oh oh)\n\nCaptivated minds are sympathizing (whoa whoa)\n\nWaiting on a sun that's never rising (whoa oh oh)\n\nBlack, black sky is hypnotizing\n\n\n\nFade to black\n\nFade to black",
