  "lyrics": "I though we had a place, just our place, our home place, my headspace\r\nWas you and I always, but that phase has been phased in our place\r\nI see it on your face, a small trace, a place laid, we been erased\r\nBut if we're way too faded to drive, you can stay one more night\r\nWe said we'd both love higher than we knew we could go\n\nBut still the hardest part is knowing when to let go\n\nYou wanted to go higher, higher, higher\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down, Babylon\n\n\n\nBabylon\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down\n\n\n\nWe're tired of the view, it's your fuse, my half choose are not amused\n\nI wish we had a clue to start new, a white moon, no residue\n\nThe color of our mood is so rude, a cold June, we're not immune\n\nBut if we're way too faded to fight, you can stay one more night\n\n\n\nWe said we'd both love higher than we knew we could go\n\nBut still the hardest part is knowing when to let go\n\nYou wanted to go higher, higher, higher\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down, Babylon\n\n\n\nBabylon\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down\n\n\n\nWe said we'd both love higher than we knew we could go\n\nBut still the hardest part is knowing when to let go\n\nYou wanted to go higher, higher, higher\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down\n\nWe said we'd both love higher than we knew we could go\n\nBut still the hardest part is knowing when to let go\n\nYou wanted to go higher, higher, higher\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down, Babylon\n\n\n\nBabylon\n\nBurn too bright, now the fire's gone, watch it all fall down",
