  "lyrics": "Conversations like burning fire\r\nCan you feel the distance roll in like floodwater?\r\nWith loneliness and love it's a thin line\r\nIn your absence either could be right\r\nCall it what you'd like but I'm undone\n\nFeeling cold, feeling cold\n\n\n\nDampening the thoughts of the true right\n\nCurse my inward sight, leaves you unheard\n\nIs there love in spite of the many motives of my mind?\n\nWould you fight?\n\nWould you fight?\n\n\n\nWith loneliness and love it's a thin line\n\nIn your absence either could be right\n\nCall it what you'd like but I'm undone\n\nFeeling cold, feeling cold\n\n\n\nWould you fight?\n\nWould you fight?",
