  "lyrics": "I thought that being skinny was the answer to all my problems\r\nI thought if you found me pretty then I'll be fine\r\nI thought if you loved I'd be a person\r\nIt's only if you wanted me but I have peace of mind\r\nI thought being smart meant impressing others\n\nI thought growing up meant pressing the lies\n\nI thought I had to be someone in order for you to like me\n\nCouldn't see I already was long before you crossed my mind\n\n\n\nSo if I'm ugly\n\nWell I'm so much more than that\n\nI'm so much more than you'll ever know\n\nOh if I'm ugly\n\nI am still so much more than that\n\nI'm so much more than you'll ever know\n\n\n\nI thought I had to be everything that you could ever need\n\nI thought I had to be strong so that you'd never hurt\n\nI thought the biggest thing in life was to live for someone else\n\nBut I kept on failing and it led me in the back\n\n\n\nSo if I'm ugly\n\nWell I'm so much more than that\n\nI'm so much more than you'll ever know\n\nOh if I'm ugly\n\nI am still so much more than that\n\nI'm so much more than you'll ever know\n\n\n\nBut I looked at my own mother\n\nWho told me to be strong\n\nWhen the world urged me to be better\n\nShe assured me it will\n\n\n\nSo if I'm ugly\n\nWell I'm so much more than that\n\nI'm so much more than you'll ever know\n\nSo what if I'm ugly\n\nI am still so much more than that\n\nI'm so much than you'll ever know",
