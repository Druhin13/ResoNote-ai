  "lyrics": "I can only tell the truth, yeah\r\nFirst time that we locked eyes\r\nStomach felt like it had knots tied\r\nI cannot lie, I wanted to try\r\nBut I knew right then it was not the time\n\nSo I sat back and played my position\n\nAnd I prayed that you made your decision\n\nAnd I know that I was an asshole\n\nBut I felt all along that you ain't really with it\n\nLove the way that you talk to me\n\nWhen you talk to me like my best friend\n\nWhen you provide me with security\n\nAnd a future that we can invest in\n\nHate the city, cost too much money\n\nAsking you to move out to the country\n\nWhite picket fence with a nice little crib\n\nPlay this guitar we can raise these kids\n\nAin't no sunset on this boulevard\n\nSo come and go as you please\n\nAnd forgive me 'cause I know it seems\n\nThat these roads here were paved to broken dream\n\nAin't no Las Vegas lights\n\nAin't no California coast\n\nAnd I've seen a lot of both\n\nBut this shit is in my soul, and so are you\n\n\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm riding with you baby, in it for the long run\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm living like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm riding with you baby, in it for the long run\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm living like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun\n\n\n\nBaby look at that big picture\n\nNo more skipping through all them bad scenes\n\nSeeing nightmares only make it sweeter\n\nWhen you living inside them wild dreams\n\nNever live inside someone else's mean\n\nWe gone fly high even if we down\n\nSo stick around I'ma spend my life\n\nRight by your side polishing your crown\n\nStand up and adjust it, girl\n\nI'm riding with you, better trust it\n\nLeave them haters disgusted\n\nThey can't catch up 'cause we mustard\n\nAnd we suffered long enough in the gutter\n\nWe both deserve what we built here\n\nWe instill fear 'cause our fairy tale\n\nIs so real with no end near\n\nBeen here for over 10 years\n\nYou're no stranger to the danger of my life\n\nGripped the banger like you hold my heart\n\nThen squeeze tight, never let it slip\n\nBig city lights, slow country pace\n\nLeather and lace, outlaws and angels\n\nWe wove a web of love and trust\n\nStay wrapped up 'cause I'm so tangled\n\n\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm riding with you baby, in it for the long run\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm living like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm riding with you baby, in it for the long run\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm living like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun\n\n\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm riding with you baby, in it for the long run\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm living like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm riding with you baby, in it for the long run\n\nLove won, I give you my gun\n\nI'm living like a dirty bomb strapped to the sun",
