  "lyrics": "He pulled into that parking lot with them out of state tags\r\nI fell in love before he even unpacked his bags\r\nOne look, one smile, one 'What's your name?'\r\nOne 'What you doing later? Wanna grab a drink?'\r\nAnd it was hello summer, goodbye to my heart\n\nBlue skies and blue eyes, a hell of a way to start\n\nLetting him go would be the hardest part\n\nHello summer, goodbye to my heart\n\nTo my heart\n\n\n\nAnd who knew that one drink could turn into five?\n\nCrazy how June burned into July\n\nTryna keep September from creeping in my head\n\nI knew what I was getting into the minute I said\n\n\n\nAnd it was hello summer, goodbye to my heart\n\nBlue skies and blue eyes, a hell of a way to start\n\nLetting him go would be the hardest part\n\nHello summer, goodbye to my heart\n\nTo my heart, oh yeah\n\n\n\nYeah, he packed his bags, filled his tank with gas\n\nMan, it went by so fast\n\nToo good to last, yeah, just like that\n\n\n\nIt was goodbye summer, you tore me apart\n\nBlue skies and blue eyes fade into the dark\n\nLetting go is the hardest part\n\n\n\nHello summer, goodbye to my heart\n\nBlue skies and blue eyes, a hell of a way to start\n\nLetting him go will be the hardest part\n\nGoodbye summer, hello to my broken heart\n\nMy broken heart, my broken heart\n\nTo my broken heart, yeah\n\n\n\nGoodbye summer",
