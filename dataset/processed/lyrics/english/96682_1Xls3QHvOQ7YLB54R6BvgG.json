  "lyrics": "My day will come, I gave too much\r\nI sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full\r\nMy only one, your dying love, I've seen enough\r\nI tried but, I don't think so, maybe it was me who was fucking up\r\nI gave all I could give but, it seems like it never really was enough\n\n\n\nI feel left out, I don't see how\n\nMy whole life can change in one week\n\nI don't mind my own reflection\n\nI don't see how, you've been let down\n\nDon't speak unless you have to\n\nWhy you always seem in a bad mood?\n\nYour whole life you had an attitude\n\nOne day, is this so bad for you?\n\n\n\nI'm sorry if I hurt you, I'm sorry if it got that bad\n\nI'm sorry I can't help you, somebody should've had your back\n\n\n\nI tried but, I don't think so, maybe it was me who was fucking up\n\nI gave all I could give but, it seems like it never really was enough\n\n\n\nI changed my, whole life when\n\nI learned to, ignore them\n\nI changed my, whole life up\n\nMaybe it was not enough\n\nI don't think I'm allowed to\n\nMake a deal with your selfish ways\n\nThey're acting vicious out there\n\nThere's lots of demons out here\n\n\n\nI'm sorry if I hurt you, I'm sorry if it got that bad\n\nI'm sorry I can't help you, somebody should've had your back\n\n\n\nI tried but, I don't think so, maybe it was me who was fucking up\n\nI gave all I could give but, it seems like it never really was enough",
