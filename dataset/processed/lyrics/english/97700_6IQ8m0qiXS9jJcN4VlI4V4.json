  "lyrics": "Let me come inside, swallow all your pride\r\nSaid you had that fire, please don't change your mind\r\nKeep me no surprise, this is homicide\r\nWillfully I die, this is suicide\r\nI wanna fuck you\n\nLike I love you\n\nI wanna fuck you\n\nLike I love you\n\n\n\nNever close my eyes, I wanna see it all\n\nI wanna make you come to me, I wanna see you crawl\n\nThe world is turning 'round while you and me go down\n\nMoaning in my ear, climax, I wanna heard the sound\n\n(The sound, the sound, the sound, the sound)\n\n\n\nI wanna fuck you\n\nLike I love you\n\nI wanna fuck you\n\nLike I love you\n\n\n\nMadonna, Madonna, Madonna, what kind of mama raised you?\n\nAnd I'm the piranha who chased you\n\nThrew me inside of your prison, I made up my decision\n\nMy only regret is they didn't make two\n\nHappily a victim to the collision, running head-on\n\nSee, that's a motherfucking breakthrough\n\nTold me I couldn't handle it and, baby, you was dead wrong\n\nWhat happened to the harder way?\n\nYou turned it to a marathon, tear that pussy down\n\nThrow the wig on, very into blondes, whatever you want\n\nWith the break of dawn, each and every song\n\nI'ma let the gun go until you call it quit, donezo\n\nYou puttin' on a show and I'm sitting front row\n\nYou got with the one told, that could wake them, you know\n\nPlus I got an ego to uphold, true, to put it to you blunt...\n\n\n\nI wanna fuck you\n\nLike I love you\n\nI wanna fuck you\n\nLike I love you",
