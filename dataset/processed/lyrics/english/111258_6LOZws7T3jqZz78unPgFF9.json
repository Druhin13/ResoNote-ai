I can't hear a thing\nTry to talk some sense to myself, but I won't listen\nI'm what God made of me, don't need to pretend\nIt's okay to disagree, we don't have to be friends\nSee, you think you got problems with me?\nBut baby I don't even think about you\nYou're mad at everything I do\nBut what are you up to? I haven't a clue\n'Cause baby you're dead to me\nWhy can't I be dead to you?\nI think that we both know the truth\n\nYou're obsessed, just let it go\nYou're dead to me\n\nYou're obsessed, just let me go\nYou're dead to me\nI'm not somebody you know\nYou're dead to me\nCould you just leave me alone?\nYou're dead to me\n\nWhy can't you see you're dead to me?\nJust let it be, you're dead to me\nWhy can't you see you're dead to me?\nJust let it be, you're dead to me\n\nYou're obsessed, just let it go\nYou're dead to me\nYou're obsessed, just let me go\nYou're dead to me\nI'm not somebody you know\nYou're dead to me\n\nCould you just leave me alone?\nYou're dead to me",
