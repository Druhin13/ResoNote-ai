  "lyrics": "Seen it all, endless nights and storm clouds brewing\r\nA tired heart, 18 wheels and ash-vault moving.\r\nI felt the hurt along the way, seen the tears roll down her face\r\nNothing could ever take her place\r\nOut there on the road so alone\r\nHome, finally home\r\nSometimes it's hard to stop a rolling stone\r\nBut whenever it may roll, it always seems to find its way back home\r\nEarly sun rising, in and out of hotel rooms\r\nHighways winding, another town to push on through\r\nPainted memories in my mind\r\nThey got me through hard days and the longer nights\r\nBut now I'm turning back the tide, I didn't realize how far I'd gone\r\nHome, finally home\r\nSometimes it's hard to be a rolling stone\r\nBut wherever I may roll, I always seem to find my way back home\r\nâ™ª\r\nEndless nights, that emptiness lasted forever\r\nWhen all I wanted was for all of us to be together\r\nHome, finally home\r\nSometimes it's hard to stop a rolling stone\r\nBut wherever it may roll, it always seems to find its way back home\r\nIt always seems to find its way back home\r\nI always seem to find my way back home",
