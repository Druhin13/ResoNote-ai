  "lyrics": "You can hear the sound\r\nOf the underground trains\r\nYou know it feels like distant thunder\r\nYou know there's so many people\r\nLiving in this house\n\nAnd don't even know their names\n\n\n\nI guess it's just a feeling - in the city)\n\n\n\nWalls so thin I can almost\n\nHear them breathing\n\nAnd if I listen in\n\nI feel my own heart beating\n\n\n\n(I guess it's just a feeling - in the city)",
