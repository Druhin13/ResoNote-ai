  "lyrics": "I took a beatin', hell I took some bad ones\r\nJust tryin' to hold this thing straight\r\nIt's hard work, believin'\r\nYou win some, you lose some\r\nWhile watchin' your work go to waste\r\nDon't know when to start runnin'\n\nDon't know if I'm done in\n\nOr whether to pull you in tight\n\nWhen you're this deep in somethin'\n\nCan be certain what's comin'\n\nBut I got this cold feelin' I'm right\n\n\n\nSo if you know something, I don't\n\nWon't you please, please, open my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\n\n\nI dragged some dirt in\n\nI know that we both did\n\nWe dragged it all over the floor\n\nFrom dancing and turning\n\nTo pacing and worrying\n\nThere's wear deep in every board\n\nThere were two, now there's one\n\nDown from so much to none\n\nAt some point somebody got tired\n\nIs it easy for some\n\nTo know what's to be done\n\nTo make it or only keep trying\n\n\n\nSo if you know something, I don't\n\nWon't you please, please, open my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\n\n\nI would stare at myself in the mirror\n\nIf I thought that I had any answers\n\nHell finding my way just by failure\n\nOh so far we can see clear\n\n\n\nSo if you know something, I don't\n\nIf you know something, I don't\n\nWon't you please, please, open my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\nOpen my eyes\n\n\n\nIf you know something, I don't\n\nWon't you please, please\n\nWon't you please, please, open your eyes",
