  "lyrics": "You had your soul with you, I was in no mood\r\nDrift away, and I could forget\r\nI had only one last feather left\r\nI wore it on the island of my head\r\nI had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet\n\nYou felt like heaven stood up in you\n\nYou said love fills you out\n\nIt moves you from the skeleton and pulls you around\n\nI got it worse than anyone else\n\nAnd I just can't find a way to forgive myself\n\nI had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet\n\n\n\nI have owed it to my heart, every word I've said\n\nYou have no idea how hard I died when you left\n\nIf I yield to my trances, will I get up close again?\n\nI had only one thing to do and I couldn't do it yet\n\nI had only one thing left and I couldn't see it yet\n\n\n\nYou had your soul with you, I was in no mood\n\nYou had your soul with you, I was in no mood",
