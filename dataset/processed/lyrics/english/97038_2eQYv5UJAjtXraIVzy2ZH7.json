  "lyrics": "It ain't just about the bars\r\nIt ain't just about an umbrella in your drink\r\nIt ain't just about the cars\r\nChopped up, dropped down, ridin' low in the street\r\nAnd it ain't the sand on my feet\r\nThat's got me thinkin' I might never leave\n\nI'm feelin' words that I can't speak\n\nI can learn, girl, if you can teach\n\nYeah\n\n\n\nSeñorita, yes, I need ya\n\nOn my lips like a shot of tequila\n\nSo como se dice, I think I might stay\n\nLeave an empty seat on that airplane\n\nYou're the only thing I've been lookin' at all night\n\nMamacita got me movin' down to paradise\n\nMi bonita, I can't leave ya\n\nSeñorita, señorita\n\n\n\nIt ain't gonna take much time\n\nGive me one more dance, mi amor\n\nYou're gonna be loco by the end of the night\n\nSo good, I'll make you wanna leave it all behind\n\n\n\nSeñorita, yes, I need ya\n\nOn my lips like a shot of tequila\n\nSo, ¿cómo se dice? I think I might stay\n\nLeave an empty seat on that airplane\n\nYou're the only thing I've been lookin' at all night\n\nMamacita got me movin' down to paradise\n\nMi bonita, I can't leave ya\n\nSeñorita, señorita\n\n\n\nAnd it ain't the sand on my feet\n\nIt's the way that you're lookin' at me\n\nThat's got me thinkin' I might never leave\n\nThat's got me thinkin' that you're all I need\n\nI'm thinkin' words that I can't speak\n\nYo soy loca para ti\n\nI can learn, girl, if you can teach\n\n\n\nSeñorita, yes, I need ya\n\nOn my lips like a shot of tequila (Shot of tequila)\n\nSo, ¿cómo se dice? I think I might stay\n\nLeave an empty seat on that airplane\n\nYou're the only thing I've been lookin' at all night (Toda la noche)\n\nMamacita got me movin' down to paradise (Hasta el paraíso)\n\nMi bonita, I can't leave ya\n\nSeñorita, señorita",
