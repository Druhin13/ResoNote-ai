Let my choppa spray\n\nPull up on homie like andale\n\nI ain't got no time to conversate\n\n\n\nWhen I wake up up in the morning I'm on the dough\n\nGet my check then I'm out the door\n\nYou ain't talm bout a check then its time to go\n\nRambo with these 9's and these foes\n\nChiraq where you find me at\n\nBig house where my drugs be at\n\nOn me where my gun be at\n\nSo you better not try me jack\n\nOn me where my baby at\n\nOn me where your lady at\n\nOn me where my K be at\n\nI'm never lonely I'mma spray your ass\n\n\n\nWhen I wake up up in the morning I brush my teeth\n\nWhen I wake up up in the morning I'm countin G's\n\nWhen I wake up in the morning Kay Kay over me\n\nYou want beef? better warm it cause my pole with me\n\nWhen I wake up I'm glad to see another day\n\nYou wanna play?
