  "lyrics": "You said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\r\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\r\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\r\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\r\nYou said you'd be there 'til the bitter end\n\nYour voice feels bitter now\n\nThe world I'm fighting for just plays pretend\n\nI'm surrendering\n\nI'm surrendering\n\nI'm surrendering\n\nWay too long, way too long\n\nWay too long, way too long\n\n\n\nI'm not gonna turn my head\n\nYou play the part I'm holding out my hands\n\nOut of sight, out of mind, out of sight\n\nI feel you in the air. You haunt me everywhere\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\n\n\n\nWhite lies\n\nYou do this every time\n\nWe fall in familiar places\n\nDrift apart and don't know why\n\nBreaths we take, like breaths we take\n\nYou're gone. Gone\n\nBreaths we take, like breaths we take\n\nYou're gone. You play the part I'm holding out my hands\n\n\n\nWay too long, way too long\n\nWay too long, way too long\n\n\n\nYou said you'd be there 'til the bitter end\n\nYour voice is bitter now\n\nThe world I'm fighting for just plays pretend\n\nI'm surrendering\n\n\n\nWhite lies\n\nYou do this every time\n\nWe fall in familiar places\n\nDrift apart and don't know why\n\nBreaths we take, like breaths we take\n\nYou're gone. Gone\n\nBreaths we take, like breaths we take\n\nYou're gone. You are the reason for the life I live\n\n\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there\n\nYou said you'd be there, be-be-be-be-be there, be there",
