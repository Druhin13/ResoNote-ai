  "lyrics": "Can you hear the crickets?\r\nAll I hear is crickets\r\nLike a river\r\nShining through the edges of my sight\r\nThe sky is pitch black, dark\r\nYet somehow really peaceful\n\nAt the same time\n\n\n\nIt gets dark in the morning\n\nTrade sleep for drinks in a bar\n\nI'm sure as hell my breath stinks\n\nWatch it float like smoke in the fog\n\nI can feel a tornado\n\nAnd it's shivering up my arms\n\nI've been playing dominoes\n\nI'm just trying not to wreck no cars\n\nPutting fear in my nose\n\nAnd trying to keep up with all my thoughts\n\n\n\nIf we're going somewhere, I'm ready\n\nIf it's just dirt, I'm not\n\n\n\nI scrape my eye when I touch the sky\n\nAnd lose a little vision for the man\n\nI can call it in my mind\n\nI don't want to hold nobody's hand\n\nI can toss in the morning light\n\nI'll play dead when I'm buried in the sand\n\nI'm seeing shadows of man a who's\n\nHomeless, buried and numb\n\nA forecast of forgotten land\n\nI hope it shows up in the setting sun\n\n\n\nIf we're going somewhere, I'm ready, honey\n\nIf it's nowhere, I'm done\n\n\n\nI can hear a voice but it's speaking code\n\n(Poured concrete on top, concrete on top, concrete)\n\nLike I'm talking to strangers on a foreign phone\n\nI can talk to angels when I'm all alone\n\nThey take me to a place in the city\n\nAnd when we're done they take me home\n\n\n\nCan't find a forest with the singing birds\n\nInstead I'm just a low voice in the crowd\n\nCan't hear my own voice in this crowd\n\n\n\nI get edgy on dark streets\n\nComing home, I feel my heartbeat\n\nI say I'm stoned for the last time\n\nI do it again and repeat\n\n\n\nI'm carpooling to kingdom come\n\nInto the wild purgatory\n\nExperience in a magic rainbow\n\nAll you got to do is follow\n\n\n\nAnd if you're not feeling ready\n\nThere's always tomorrow\n\nAnd if you're not feeling ready\n\nThere's always tomorrow",
