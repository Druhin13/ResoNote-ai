  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Never Be the Same par Camila Cabello\r\nSomething must've gone wrong in my brain\nGot your chemicals all in my veins\nFeeling all the highs, feeling all the pain\nLet go of the ways I used to fall in lane\nNow I'm seeing red, not thinking straight\nBlurring all the lines, you intoxicate me\n\nJust like nicotine, heroin, morphine\nSuddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need\nAll I need\nYeah, you're all I need\n\nIt's you, babe\nAnd I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\nAnd I could try to run, but it would be useless\nYou're to blame\n\nJust one hit, you will know I'll never be the same\nIt's you, babe\nAnd I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\nAnd I could try to run, but it would be useless\nYou're to blame\nJust one hit, you will know I’ll never ever, ever be the same\nI'll never be the same\nI'll never be the same\nI'll never be the same\n\nSneaking in L.A. when the lights are low\nOff of one touch I could overdose\nHe said, \"stop playing it safe\nGirl, I wanna see you lose control\"\n\nJust like nicotine, heroin, morphine\n\nSuddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need\nAll I need\nOoh, yeah, you're all I need\n\nIt's you, babe\nAnd I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\nAnd I could try to run, but it would be useless\nYou're to blame\nJust one hit, you will know I'll never be the same\nIt's you, babe\nAnd I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\nAnd I could try to run, but it would be useless\nYou're to blame\nJust one hit, you will know I’ll never ever, ever be the same\nI'll never be the same\nI'll never be the same\n\nI'll never be the same\n\nYou're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head\nYou're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head\nYou're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head\nYou're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head\n\nIt's you, babe\nAnd I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\nAnd I could try to run, but it would be useless\nYou're to blame\nJust one hit, you will know I'll never be the same\nIt's you, babe\n\nAnd I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe\nAnd I could try to run, but it would be useless\nYou're to blame\nJust one hit, you will know I’ll never ever, ever be the same\nI'll never be the same\nI'll never be the same\nI'll never be the same",
