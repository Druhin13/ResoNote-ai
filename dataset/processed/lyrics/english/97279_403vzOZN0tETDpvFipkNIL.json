  "lyrics": "Sisyphus peered into the mist\r\nA stone's throw from the precipice paws\r\nDid he jump or did he fall as he gazed into the maw of the morning mist?\r\nDid he raise both fists and say, \"to hell with this and just let the rock roll\"?\r\nLet it roll, let it crash down low\n\nThere's a house down there but I lost it long ago\n\nLet it roll, let it crash down low\n\nSee my house down there but I lost it long ago\n\n\n\nWell, I let the rock roll on down to the town below\n\nWe had a house down there but I lost it long ago\n\nLost it long ago\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\n\nI'm letting it roll away\n\nIt's got nothing to do with fate\n\nAnd everything to do with you\n\n\n\nI'd rather fail like a mortal than flail like a god on a lightning rod\n\nHistory forgets the moderates\n\n\n\nFor those who sit\n\nRecalcitrant and taciturn\n\nYou know I'd rather turn and burn than scale the set of fists, yeah\n\n\n\nWhere's my accomplice?\n\nSo take my hand, we'll do more than stand\n\nTake my hand, we'll claim this land\n\nTake my hand, and we'll let the rock roll\n\n\n\nLet it roll, let it crash down low\n\nThere's a house down there but I lost it long ago\n\nLet it roll, let it crash down low\n\nSee my house down there but I lost it long ago\n\nLost it long ago\n\n\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na-na\n\nNa-na-na-na-na-na\n\nI'm letting it roll away\n\nIt's got nothing to do with fate\n\nAnd everything to do with\n\n\n\nSisyphus peered into the mist\n\nA stone's throw from the precipice paws",
