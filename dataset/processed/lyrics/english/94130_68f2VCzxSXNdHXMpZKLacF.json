  "lyrics": "Easy to see it wasted\r\nDeep in the summer time\r\nWhen the world's on fire\r\nI feel and taste it\r\nSticks to the roof of my mouth\r\nLasts through the night\n\n\n\nIt’s coming in a little bit hot, see\n\nLoving what I feel, but it gets to me\n\nAnd I know it's all in my head\n\nAnd it still makes the world feel a little like it ain't real\n\n\n\nI swear you move slow motion\n\nWatching you looks like bending time\n\nCatch me in your illusion\n\nHelping me lose my mind\n\n\n\nDouse it in the water\n\nCool when you feel it\n\nHot, but it’s turning down\n\nIt hurts to leave it\n\nBut it's much too much to handle now\n\n\n\nIt's coming in a little bit hot, see\n\nLoving what I feel, but it gets to me\n\nAnd I know it's all in my head\n\nAnd it still makes the world feel a little like it ain't real\n\n\n\nI swear you move slow motion\n\nWatching you looks like bending time\n\nCatch me in your illusion\n\nHelping me lose my mind\n\n\n\nI swear you move slow motion\n\nWatching you looks like bending time\n\nCatch me in your illusion\n\nHelping me lose my mind",
