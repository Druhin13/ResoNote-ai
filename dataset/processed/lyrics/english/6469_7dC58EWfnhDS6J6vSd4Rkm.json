  "lyrics": "You and your friends watch videos tryna dance like Beyonc√©\r\nYou was raised a church girl and now you always find yourself out on Sunday\r\nAnd do on Monday the same thing you did Tuesday and Wednesday feel the same\r\nNow you feel uncool like your auntie husband and you don't wanna feel that lame\r\nBut you don't know that much but it's okay go pour that up\r\nIf you got your drink then hold that up\n\n'Cause you ain't pay for it 'cause you got a big ol' ass\n\nSomebody bought it you ain't gotta pay that back\n\nI'm like each night and it don't get old\n\nBut just know everything that glisten ain't gold so\n\nDon't believe everything you've been told\n\nJust know that your future ain't sitting in stone like\n\nRolling Stone I rock like granite\n\nHit the stage rock the mic like Janet\n\nIf I say things they might just happen\n\nTurn stock to seeds I might just plan it up\n\nBut no ring just a saddened whip\n\nYou used to get your son from baby daddy (uh)\n\nI ain't judging beauty pageants but\n\nTime ain't never moving backwards so\n\nOkay get this infamy\n\nI just feel all the vibe that you sent for me\n\nIf God sent me an inquiry about angels and instantly\n\nYou fell outta the sky with a pair of some angel wings\n\nWould you believe in the thing called destiny\n\nSo would you live for me, or die for me, or sin for me\n\nOr play along baby girl like a symphony I'm like\n\n\n\nWould you live for me\n\nDie for me\n\nSin for me\n\nCry for me\n\nBaby if I wrote you a symphony\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nWould you live for me\n\nDie for me\n\nSin for me\n\nCry for me\n\nBaby if I wrote you a symphony\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\n\n\nI said\n\nPlay along play along like it ain't that hard\n\nDon't act too cool play your part\n\nAnd if your card decline and you claim fraud\n\nThen if your man's there then he gon' take that charge\n\nBut if it's never your fault then it's never your fault\n\nIf you don't got money you can say that thought\n\nAnd you ain't learn a thing that you pay back loans for that diploma that sit on your wall at home (damn)\n\nSo who you owe, what you own\n\nYou say you grown but I can't tell\n\nPop out best fit you gon' put it on\n\nBut you still out here takin' them big L's\n\nBroken nail\n\nCrack the screen, worked it new\n\nSet to 3 at the club you risked it all\n\nCuz you stayed there 'til they turned the lights on\n\nLookin' for that love in basketball (like what)\n\nReally though i'm just saying you be looking for the right things in wrong place's like a man catched here from you're body language\n\nAt this point get lost in translation (like damn)\n\nKnow they got it in for me, I can feel all the vibe that you sent for me, and scientific chemistry you're wai-fi wi-fi you connect to me\n\nSo let me be the Adam and you be Eve really girl i'm just trying to feel you're energy so will you live for me or die for me or sin for me or play along (baby girl like a symphony)\n\n\n\nWould you live for me\n\nDie for me\n\nSin for me\n\nCry for me\n\nBaby if I wrote you a symphony\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nWould you live for me\n\nDie for me\n\nSin for me\n\nCry for me\n\nBaby if I wrote you a symphony\n\nTell me would you play along (come on)\n\nPlay along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\nTell me would you play along\n\n\n\nIf god sent me an inquiry about angles that he missed consistently\n\nAnd that you fell out of the sky with some angel wings\n\nWould you believe it was meant to be?",
