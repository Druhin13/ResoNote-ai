  "lyrics": "There's a voice in my head telling to run away\n(Away)\nAnf i can't stop saying those things i can't unsay\nBut it's the way you speak\nThe Way you say my name\nThat it would last a week\n\nAnd you'd live without a trace\n\nBut i'm still in your arms\n\nAnd it's safe enough to fall asleep\n\nI'm tired and i can feel you breathe\n\nI don't wanna have beleive\n\nCause your love is a symphony\n\nYour love is a sympony\n\nCause your love is a sympony\n\nYour love is a sympony\n\nThere's a truth in your eyes\n\nAsking me to come inside\n\nAnd it's to forget but\n\nYou tearing my heart open wide\n\n(Open wide)\n\nIt's in the way you laugh\n\nWe'll never be apart\n\nI never felt so free\n\nWhen we're dancing in the dark\n\nCause i'm here in your arms\n\nAnd it's safe enough to fall asleep\n\nI'm tired and i can feel you breathe\n\nI don't wanna have believe\n\nCause your love is a symphony\n\nYour love is a symphony\n\nCause your love is a symphony Ã—2\n\nYour love is a symphony\n\n(End) R",
