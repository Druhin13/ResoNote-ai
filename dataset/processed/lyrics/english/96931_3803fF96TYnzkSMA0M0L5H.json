Yeah\n\n\n\nWe were, we were (Down) down with ya, down with ya\n\n(Down) Down, down with ya, down with ya\n\nDown-down-down-down with ya, down with ya\n\nDown, down with ya, down with ya\n\n(Are you down?)\n\nDown with ya, down with ya\n\nDown, down with ya, down with ya (Are you down?)\n\nWe were down\n\nDown-down-down-down with ya, down with ya (Are you down? Are you down?)\n\nDown, down with ya, down with ya (Are you down?)\n\n\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nSelling your worth\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nDown with y-down with y-down\n\nBabe, I come first\n\n\n\nAre you down?\n\nAre you down?\n\nAre you down?\n\nAre you down?",
