  "lyrics": "I don't even wanna open this door\r\nNo, I don't wanna step inside\r\nAll of our history is scattered on the floor\r\nBlurring all the enemy lines\r\nWe're too far from the start to remember\r\nWhy there's even a fight\n\nI don't wanna even talk anymore\n\nI don't wanna get left behind\n\n\n\nGetting nowhere, tired of fighting\n\nPut the gun down, do the right thing\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\nCome along, just show some mercy\n\nDo you really wanna hurt me?\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\n\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\n\n\nWhy can't we talk about it\n\nWhy don't we try\n\nI think we can change our minds\n\nIf we could just look into each other's eyes\n\nInstead of letting bullets fly\n\nMaybe we could just meet in the middle\n\nDo we have to take sides?\n\nSettle down and we don't have to go to war\n\nWhy don't we just take our time?\n\n\n\nGetting nowhere, tired of fighting\n\nPut the gun down, do the right thing\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\nCome along, just show some mercy\n\nDo you really wanna hurt me?\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\n\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\n\n\nI don't know, I don't know where we're started\n\nI don't know, I don't know where we're going\n\nAll I know is it won't make a difference\n\n\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger\n\nThat won't fix it any quicker\n\nWe don't have to pull the trigger",
