  "lyrics": "Down by deep water where sweet linden stand\r\nI saw pretty Polly wringing her hands\r\nThe song that she sung made the whole grove to ring\r\nMy Billy has left me to fight for a king\r\nAnd I wish the wars were all over\n\nI stood in amaze to hear what she said\n\nI'll follow my Billy whether living or dead\n\nThe notes that she sung were the nightingale's notes\n\nHow the lark and the linnet they warble their throats\n\nAnd I wish the wars were all over\n\n\n\nI said my dear Polly if you'll stay with me\n\nI'll make you as happy as happy can be\n\nNo then she said that never can be\n\nI'll never be happy till my Billy I see\n\nAnd I wish the wars were all over\n\n\n\nNow from my parents I'll haste and away\n\nI'll dress myself out in a young man's array\n\nAnd every company that I pass by\n\nI'll ask for my Billy or where he does lie\n\nAnd I wish the wars were all over",
