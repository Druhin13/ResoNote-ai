  "lyrics": "So this is where we are\r\nIt's not where we had wanted to be\r\nIf half the world's gone mad\r\nThe other half just don't care you see\r\nYou don't wanna fuck with us\n\nWe dash till the very last\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like the world's gone mad\n\nAnd there's nothing you could do about it\n\nNo there's nothing you could do about it\n\nWhen it feels like the world's gone mad\n\nAnd there's nothing you could do about it\n\nNo there's nothing you could do about it\n\n\n\nSo tell me what's the news\n\nAnd what is it you want me to see\n\nLying to ourselves\n\nAnd dancing by the light of the screen\n\n\n\nYou don't wanna fuck with us\n\nWe dash till the very last\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like the world's gone mad\n\nAnd there's nothing you could do about it\n\nNo there's nothing you could do about it\n\nWhen it feels like the world's gone mad\n\nAnd there's nothing you could do about it\n\nNo there's nothing you could do about it\n\n\n\nAnother man holding a microphone\n\nTryin' to say something at all\n\nOr finding himself on an empty road\n\nTrying to choose which way to go\n\n\n\nAnd so, you wanna make some money\n\nYou wanna make some money\n\nSo, you wanna be somebody\n\nYou wanna make some money\n\n\n\nWhen it feels like the world's gone mad\n\nAnd there's nothing you could do about it\n\nNo there's nothing you could do about it\n\nWhen it feels like the world's gone mad\n\nAnd there's nothing you could do about it\n\nNo there's nothing you could do about it",
