  "lyrics": "Bill: Is this it, Priest? The Pope's new army? A few crusty bitches and a handful of rag-tags?\r\nPriest Vallon: Now, now, Bill...you swore this was a battle between warriors, not a bunch of Miss Nancies. So warriors is what I brought\r\nA cold heart and a hot slug is not love\r\nThem boys'll pop up, leave you chopped up\r\nThere's a lot of pussy niggas, but it's not us\n\nGot cuffed, why you think I'm frontin' in a drop truck\n\nGrindin', I work real hard, it wasn't pot luck\n\n'Lotta work in the pot, couple niggas was shot up\n\nThe glorifying times or the horrifying crimes\n\nBut the more I see the soft shit, the more that I'm inclined\n\nTo let the real niggas it's all about the shine\n\nLet em get it in the sun, get your gun when the moon fall\n\nSoon to tell the goons meet the Ghost by the pool hall\n\n'Cause when the rules get lost, it's a fool's fault\n\nTake a smart man to get in on the smooth course\n\nSingin' you were never found by Lou Ross\n\nThinkin' can I live? Now the crib got two floors\n\nCan't snooze off, nor take my shoes off\n\n'Lotta niggas is rude, that shit'll throw your mood off\n\n'Lotta niggas is cruel, tryna' cut your fuel off\n\nWatch your ride die, no jump for you\n\nThey ain't pump you up but I bet you they got a pump for you\n\nRight here he said he would dump for you\n\nThen he went and left you for death, they on hunt for you\n\nMaybe you just blind or maybe you just fine with gettin' lyin'\n\n'Cause you pussy by design, what!\n\n\n\nMama told me to pray in the morning\n\nI'm stuck here in the place tonight\n\nGod forbid we don't make it to the mornin'\n\nIn the rain that I ..... (?) could be found in my mom's eyes\n\nSee the pain that she feel while she moaning\n\nDon't wait to pray 'til the morning\n\n'Cause you may not make it home\n\n\n\nYeah, you die if you violate, eyes dilate\n\nKnowing weed tryin' vibrate\n\nThirty-eight in my size nines win the tri-state\n\nSwim with the sharks, you a killa or you live bait\n\nConsidered a titan although I'm only five-eight\n\nBorn in the jungle, made it out, I survived hate\n\nRun with gorillas, bang my chest like I'm a primate\n\nConsider me a land pirate that knows the pie rate (?)\n\nGet lined without a ruler, nine at your medulla for a lil' bit of moolah\n\nFound his body chopped up in Mexico in the cooler\n\nRight next to a shooter and his best friend\n\nIt ain't chess but they put him in, check then\n\nIf you know the math on the wrath, he is less than\n\nFrom the south side, better hustle on the west end\n\nPain and the stress gonna kill you if it's kept in\n\nGhost nigga\n\n\n\nMama told me to pray in the morning\n\nI'm stuck here in the place tonight\n\nGod forbid we don't make it to the mornin'\n\nIn the rain that I ..... (?) could be found in my mom's eyes\n\nSee the pain that she feel while she moaning\n\nDon't wait to pray 'til the morning\n\n'Cause you may not make it home",
