  "lyrics": "I met a gin-soaked bar-room queen in Memphis\nShe tried to take me upstairs for a ride\nShe had to heave me right across her shoulder\n'Cause I just can't seem to drink you off my mind\n\nIt's the honky tonk women\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues\n\n\n\nI laid a divorc√©e in New York City\n\nI had to put up some kind of a fight\n\nThe lady then she covered me in roses\n\nShe blew my nose and then she blew my mind\n\n\n\nIt's the honky tonk women\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues\n\nAll right\n\n\n\nIt's the honky tonk women\n\nThat gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues\n\n\n\nIt's the honky tonk women\n\nGimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues",
