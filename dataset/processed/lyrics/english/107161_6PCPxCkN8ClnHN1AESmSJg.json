  "lyrics": "It all starts when it's me and you, going out on Friday night\r\nIt feels like the radio and your tires rolling to my drive\r\nThen my heart stops, like a beat drop\r\nIt's a symphony when you sweet talk\r\nMake this quiet town, feel electric, loud\r\nWhen the lights going down\n\nEvery word out of your mouth\n\n\n\nIs like music\n\nLike a 70's soundtrack\n\nWhen you look at me like that\n\nI lose it\n\nMy name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss\n\nWhen I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out\n\nWhen I'm saying nothing\n\nBut it's feeling something like music\n\n\n\nBefore I knew your love\n\nEven with the volume up, it was silent then\n\nAnd now you're walking in the room all kind of smooth, all like a violin\n\nEverybody else is white noise\n\nSo talk to me, cause your voice\n\n\n\nIs like music\n\nLike a 70's soundtrack\n\nWhen you look at me like that\n\nI lose it\n\nMy name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss\n\nWhen I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out\n\nWhen I say nothing\n\nBut it's feeling something like music\n\n\n\nYour song on my skin is like\n\nAh-ah-ah-ah\n\nSo play it again just like\n\nAh-ah-ah-ah\n\nYour song on my skin is like\n\nAh-ah-ah-ah\n\nSo play it again\n\nMy whole heart's listening to your music\n\n\n\nLike a 70's soundtrack\n\nWhen you look at me like that\n\nI lose it\n\nMy name on your lips, wanna replay your kiss\n\nWhen I wake up, and lay down, and stay up and make out\n\nWhen I say nothing\n\nBut it's feeling something like music",
