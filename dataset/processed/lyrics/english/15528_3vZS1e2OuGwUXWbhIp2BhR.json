  "lyrics": "I thought you were the one who said cold wars are a bust\r\nShe doesn't want a Romeo, just someone she can trust\r\nWith an ear to the ground\r\nLove in the age of the extremes\r\nThere's nothing better that I'd rather do\n\nThen to scatter all the myths\n\nAnd walk to the start of the end of the world with you\n\n\n\nTurn up the microphone on the national parks\n\nYou gotta switch something off if you wanna get it right\n\nA crater full of wisdom in James Turrell's eyes\n\n\n\nLight in the age of the extremes\n\nThere's nothing finer that I'd rather see\n\nThen to scatter all the myths\n\nFind another way around getting stuck at the end of the world with you\n\nThe end of the world with you\n\nAt the end of the world with you\n\nAt the end of the world with you\n\nAt the end of the world with you\n\n\n\nIf you travel out to space at the speed of light\n\nWould you send me a letter from a star going by\n\nCan't see too well out here in the dark\n\n\n\nTime in the age of the extremes\n\nThere's nothing better that I'd rather feel\n\nThen to scatter all the myths\n\nBring back a little piece of mind for you\n\nYou gotta vantage point so we'll sit and watch the view\n\nAt the edge of the end of the world",
