  "lyrics": "Midnights in winter\r\nThe glowing fire\r\nLights up your face in orange and gold\r\nI see your sweet smile\r\nShine through the darkness\r\nIt's line is etched in my memory\n\nSo I'd know you by heart\n\n\n\nMornings in April\n\nSharing the secrets\n\nWe'd walk on till the morning was gone\n\nWe were like children\n\nLaughing for hours\n\nThe joy you gave me\n\nLives on and on\n\n'Cause I know you by heart\n\n\n\nI still hear your voice\n\nOn warm summer nights\n\nWhispering like the wind\n\n\n\nOhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh, ohhhh\n\n\n\nYou left in autumn\n\nThe leaves were turning\n\nI walked down roads of orange and gold\n\nI saw your sweet smile\n\nI heard your laughter\n\nYou're still here beside me\n\nEveryday\n\n'Cause I know you by heart\n\n'Cause I know you by heart",
