  "lyrics": "I'd sell my soul \nTo take my words back again \nThey fell on a cold empty heart less stare \nAn aching I could not contain \nIt left me alone in the \n\n\nDarkness pulling me apart at the seams \n\nLike every breath is taken I see \n\nNow what I didn't want to believe \n\nI wish I didn't hope now that she's \n\nAlone in the darkness like me \n\nAlone in the darkness like me \n\n\n\nOne last chance \n\nI poured my heart out again \n\nOn pages that turned into ashes \n\nFloat never could erase this stain \n\nThe marks that were left in the \n\n\n\nDarkness pulling me apart at the seams \n\nLike every breath is taken I see \n\nNow what I didn't want to believe \n\nI wish I didn't hope now that she's \n\nAlone in the darkness like me \n\nAlone in the darkness like me \n\n\n\nDarkness pulling me apart at the seams \n\nLike every breath is taken I see \n\nNow what I didn't want to believe \n\nI wish I didn't hope now that she's \n\nAlone in the darkness like me \n\nAlone in the darkness like me",
