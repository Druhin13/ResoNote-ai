  "lyrics": "If I could command the wind\r\nI would make it blow a whisper to you\r\nOn a soft and quiet breeze\r\n'Cause I see what you're going through\r\nIf I could convince the angels\n\nI would have them blowing\n\nWords of wisdom in your ears\n\nWith the dinging sound of bells\n\nJust to make you understand what I mean\n\n\n\nThat there's always more\n\nThere's always more\n\nAlways more to learn\n\nThere's always more\n\nAlways more\n\nThere's always more to know\n\n\n\n'Cause there's always a reason\n\nThere's always a way\n\nThere's always a better word to say\n\nAnd there's always an answer\n\nThere's always a why\n\nThere's always a chance to give a try\n\n\n\nAlways more, always more\n\nThere's always more to know\n\n\n\nAlways more, always more\n\nAlways more to love, to live, to cry, to sing…\n\n\n\n'Cause there's always a reason\n\nThere's always a way\n\nThere's always a better word to say\n\nSo let's say you have answers\n\nSo let's say you know why\n\nLet's say you have reached the final line\n\n\n\nThere'll always be a way\n\nAnd always more to learn\n\nAlways more for us…",
