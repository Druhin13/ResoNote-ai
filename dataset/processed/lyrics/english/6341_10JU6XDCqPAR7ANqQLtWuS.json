  "lyrics": "Found myself in a scene\r\nTold my friends how you made me\r\nThey let you stomp in still\r\nKept you around against my will\r\nNo one will listen, no one will talk\n\nI had to leave just to hear my thoughts\n\n\n\nMy body is a burden\n\nI’m always yearning\n\nTo be less accommodating\n\nTo say loud how I’m feeling\n\n\n\nA brief breath of safety\n\nDisturbed by a series of break-ins\n\nSpills out brain onto the plate and\n\nServes to host but one party\n\n\n\nWhere the air hits invisible\n\nA spot so thin it’s miserable\n\nTries to carve a place to escape\n\nBut holes out in a wholly unholy place\n\n\n\nYou could hardly hear them crack\n\nCrashed down onto concrete so vast",
