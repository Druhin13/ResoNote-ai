  "lyrics": "You think I'm cryin' over you\r\nYou think I'm dyin' too\r\nYou think I'm thinkin' way too much\r\nAnd sadly out of touch\r\nWith all the world and all our friends\r\nWell think what you want and think again\n\nThink again\n\n'Cause what you don't know\n\nIs I'm throwin' a party\n\nAnd everybody tonight is feelin' alright, some jack in their coke\n\nThe records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'\n\nThere ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones\n\nNo, I ain't alone\n\nI feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo\n\n\n\nThere ain't no lights on, the curtains drawn\n\nJust one car in the drive\n\nAnd the neighbors might think it's a haunted house, yeah\n\nBut I've never felt so alive\n\n\n\n'Cause what they don't know is I'm throwin' a party\n\nAnd everybody tonight is feelin' alright, some jack in their coke\n\nThe records are spinnin' and the speakers are smokin'\n\nThere ain't no last call, I'm havin' a ball with Hank Haggard and Jones\n\nNo, I ain't alone\n\nI feel right at home with my ghosts on the stereo",
