  "lyrics": "If you show me your body do you think that I'd like it\r\nWould you stand up there proudly\r\nWould you feel like you're dying\r\nI don't care if your jeans don't fit that well\r\nSo don't be hiding\n\nI am not that bothered by this stuff\n\nYou're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting\n\nYou don't have to sell it I am sold\n\nSo give me all your garbage and your gold\n\n\n\nIf I opened your wallet what would I discover\n\nAre you cashed up or struggling with a hole in your pocket\n\nIf we spent hour late you should see the junk I spend my money on\n\n\n\nSo don't be hiding\n\nI am not that bothered by this stuff\n\nYou're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting\n\nYou don't have to sell it I am sold\n\nSo give me all your garbage and your gold\n\n\n\nDon't be hiding\n\nI am not that bothered by this stuff\n\nYou're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting\n\nYou don't have to sell it I am sold\n\nSo give me all your garbage and your gold\n\n\n\nSo don't think twice\n\nI'm not that nice\n\nIt's just the way I feel for you and any other\n\n\n\nDon't be hiding\n\nI am not that bothered by this stuff\n\nYou're fighting, for no other reason that it makes it more exciting\n\nYou don't have to sell it I am sold\n\nSo give me all your garbage and your gold",
