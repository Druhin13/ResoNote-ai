  "lyrics": "All the remains of our cadaver of days,\r\nI keep hidden away, keep them there just in case.\r\nI wanna visit that place,\r\nblow the dust from the bones\r\noff a body of years that I leave all alone.\r\nJust a body of years,\n\nsee the skin disappears\n\nand the blood turns to stone\n\nand the body of years now a pile of bones.\n\nLike a sheet of veneer\n\neach a piece of my soul.\n\nIt's a body of years that I leave all alone.\n\nJust a body of years,now a pile of bones.\n\nYou knoww..\n\nOhhh\n\n....falls down..\n\ncan't stop trippin' on these..\n\n... go down...\n\nget back up and get my foot in the door,\n\nand my face on the page\n\nmake my mark in the world\n\nwith a bag and a blade.\n\nIT's a body of work that you can't ever change\n\nlike a body of years that you take to your grave.\n\n\n\nIt's just a body of years that I leave all alone.\n\nIt's just a body of years, now a pile of bones.\n\nLike a sheet of veneer,\n\nnow a piece of my soul.\n\nOhh...\n\n...falls down...\n\ncan't stop trippin' on these..\n\nohhh..\n\n.....go down..\n\nOhhh...\n\n[body of years [repeat]]\n\nsdjdf.. can't stop tripping on these..\n\nIt's just a body of years that I leave all alone,\n\nit's just a pile of years, now a pile of bones.\n\nLike a sheet of veneer,\n\neach a piece of my soul.\n\nLike a pile of shit I can't seem to forget?\n\nJust a body of years that I leave all alone..\n\n\n\nTell, tell, diary pages..\n\nTheir own.....\n\n...\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Lea for these lyrics)",
