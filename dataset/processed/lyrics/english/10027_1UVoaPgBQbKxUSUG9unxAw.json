  "lyrics": "I don't sleep well\r\nTake a day off\r\nTake a day tomorrow\r\nDidn't cope well\r\nWas it fake love\r\nPhysical or borrowed\r\nI'm needing some peace of mind\r\nI'm needing some peace of mind\r\nFeeling like I'm in mad love\r\nWhen we break up\r\nNow it's hard love\r\nAnd I hate that\r\nAnd I'm sorry\r\nFor the way it had to end\r\nOh oh oh\r\nI won't be there to hold you through the night\r\nWhen we're both scared, just pray for peace of mind\r\nYes I'll wait for you on the other side\r\nOn and on oh\r\nI'll stay in mad love\r\nSave your sorrow\r\nFor the jukebox\r\nWhen you play the 80s\r\nFeelings borrowed\r\nFrom the movies, I'll ignore the ratings\r\nYou're needing some peace of mind\r\nYou're needing some peace of mind\r\nYou're needing some peace of mind\r\nYou're needing some peace of mind\r\nFeeling like I'm in mad love\r\nWhen we break up\r\nNow it's hard love\r\nAnd I hate that\r\nAnd I'm sorry\r\nFor the way it had to end\r\nOh oh oh\r\nI won't be there to hold you through the night\r\nWhen we're both scared, just pray for peace of mind\r\nYes I'll wait for you on the other side\r\nOn and on oh\r\nI'll stay in mad love\r\nI won't be there to hold you through the night\r\nWhen we're both scared, just pray for peace of mind\r\nYes I'll wait for you on the other side\r\nI won't be there\r\nWhen we're both scared\r\nYes I'll wait for you on the other side\r\nBut until that day\r\nI'll stay in mad love",
