  "lyrics": "Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces\r\nYeah, what's your definition of success? (ayy!)\r\nI don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (woo!)\r\nI don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest\r\nWho I am and who I wanna be can not connect; why?\n\nDon't think I deserve it? You get no respect (woo!)\n\nI just made a couple mil', still not impressed\n\nLet You Down goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (ayy!)\n\nSmile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!\n\nI push away the people that I love the most; why? (woo!)\n\nI don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (woo!)\n\nThat makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (ayy!)\n\nStop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive\n\nUntil I die—this isn't Nate's flow (woo!)\n\nJust let me rhyme; I'm in disguise\n\nI'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind\n\nThey don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!\n\nI've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (woo!)\n\nTake my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like\n\nAs a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside\n\nNow I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo!\n\nThey don't invite me to the parties but I still arrive\n\nKick down the door and then I go inside\n\nGive off that \"I do not belong here\" vibe\n\nThen take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride\n\nWhy do y'all look mortified? (ayy!)\n\nI keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized\n\nLet You Down's the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (woo!)\n\nStory time; wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah!)\n\nIf I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise\n\nI, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (haha!)\n\nI do not need nobody to help me—lies\n\nI kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?\n\nI don't understand, it's got me questionin' like, \"Why?\n\nJust tell me why\"—now back to this flow\n\nInside I feel divided\n\nBack when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive\n\nBack before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, \"Who am I, man?\" Woo!\n\nNothin' to me's ever good enough\n\nI could be workin' for twenty-four hours a day and think I never did enough\n\nMy life is a movie but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (no!)\n\nI wanna be great but I get it in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be\n\nWhy do I do it though? Ayy, yeah\n\nWhy you always lookin' aggravated?\n\nNot a choice, you know I had to make it\n\nWhen they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation\n\nLike somethin' then I gotta take it\n\nWrite somethin' then I might erase it\n\nI love it, then I really hate it\n\nWhat's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!\n\nI know I like to preach to always be yourself (yeah)\n\nBut my emotions make me feel like I am someone else\n\nMe and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help\n\nWhich feels like I'm at war inside myself but I forgot the shells\n\nI hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell\n\nA lot of people know me, but, not a lot know me well\n\nHold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell\n\nA lot of people know me, but, they don't know me well\n\n\n\nToo many faces, too many faces, too many faces",
