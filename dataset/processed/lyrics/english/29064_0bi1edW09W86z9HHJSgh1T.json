Your nigga got scabies\r\nYour nigga he text me, your nigga he bless me\r\nI'm wetter than Haiti, I'm wetter than Harvey\r\nNiggas ain't shit, so I lead 'em on then pass 'em\n\nImma need a blunt, so Imma call 'em up let's gas it\n\nHe talkin' bout \"let's smash it\", yeah I ain't finna match it\n\nImma smoke his blunt, but I ain't finna pass it\n\n\n\nImma smoke the blunt, then treat a nigga like a roach\n\nLet him eat me out, then swerve his ass like a Porsche\n\nI'm winnin, you losin' you losin'\n\nYour nigga, he choosin' he choosin'\n\nI'm boolin', I'm boolin' I'm boolin'\n\nAll of these niggas I'm fooling\n\n\n\nWhy do they all hate me?\n\nWhy do they all hate me?

You don't trust me\"\n\nI said I don't care if you love me\n\nSo hate me, hate me\n\nHate me, hate me (hate me)",
