(no can do right, yeah)\r\nLately I been bumping trap music\n\nDon't wanna listen if I canâ€™t die to it\n\nCause all that other shit makes me think about all the things I don't wanna think about\n\nBut I'm a hypocrite, cause here I am with another slow song\n\nI'm a hypocrite, singing like a nigga doing no wrong\n\nEver since I got me a cheque I got a chick \n\nThem digits really have bitches coming for your neck (for your neck)",
