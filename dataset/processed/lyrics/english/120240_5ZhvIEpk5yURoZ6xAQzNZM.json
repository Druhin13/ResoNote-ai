  "lyrics": "No one even cares\r\nTell my friends that I don't need you\r\nLast time we spoke was spring break in that see-through\r\nConversation we had in the ocean with them waves\r\nBrought me down, down, down\n\nI need you more than I need me\n\nTurned 25, and I feel that I'm peaking\n\nYou're in Detroit, when I call you, you're sleeping\n\nThat's bringing me down, down, down\n\n\n\nAm I wasting my breath?\n\nYou're not even upset\n\n\n\nWhen's the last time that you called me just to say hi?\n\nClaiming that you don't remember things that I said to you\n\nActing all sly, sly\n\nAm I supposed to say that I'm thriving?\n\nThat I got girls on the side? 'Cause I don't\n\nIt's always been you\n\nYeah, I don't\n\nIt's always been you\n\n\n\nMessage you, but it's a typo\n\nTelling your friends that I'm acting all psycho\n\nGot my attention when you call me Michael\n\nThat's bringing me down, down, down\n\nRemember nights when you undressed\n\nValley to Venice, top down with your sundress\n\nThen I say one thing that makes you so upset\n\nThat brings you down, down, down\n\n\n\nAm I wasting my breath?\n\nYou're not even upset\n\n\n\nWhen's the last time that you called me just to say hi?\n\nClaiming that you don't remember things that I said to you\n\nActing all sly, sly\n\nAm I supposed to say that I'm thriving?\n\nThat I got girls on the side? 'Cause I don't\n\nIt's always been you\n\nYeah, I don't\n\nIt's always been you\n\n\n\nFor some reason, you don't think\n\nThat you're the one for me, for me\n\nFor some reason, you don't think\n\nThat you're the one for me, for me\n\n\n\nWhen's the last time that you called me just to say hi? Just to say hi\n\nClaiming that you don't remember things that I said to you\n\nActing all sly, sly\n\nAm I supposed to say that I'm thriving?\n\nThat I got girls on the side? 'Cause I don't\n\nIt's always been you\n\nYeah, I don't\n\nIt's always been you",
