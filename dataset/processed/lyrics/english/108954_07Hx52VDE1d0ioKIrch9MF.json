  "lyrics": "(Bob Welch)\r\nIt's the same kind of story\r\nThat seems to come down from long ago\r\nTwo friends having coffee together\r\nWhen something flies by their window\n\nIt might be out on that lawn\n\nWhich is wide, at least half of a playing field\n\nBecause there's no explaining what your imagination\n\nCan make you see and feel\n\nSeems like a dream\n\nThey got me hypnotized\n\nNow it's not a meaningless question\n\nTo ask if they've been and gone\n\nI remember a talk about North\n\nCarolina and a strange, strange pond\n\nYou see the sides were like glass\n\nIn the thick of a forest without a road\n\nAnd if any man's ever made that land\n\nThen I think it would've showed\n\nSeems like a dream\n\nThey got me hypnotized\n\nThey say there's a place down in Mexico\n\nWhere a man can fly over mountains and hills\n\nAnd he don't need an airplane or some kind of engine\n\nAnd he never will\n\nNow you know it's a meaningless question\n\nTo ask if those stories are right\n\n'Cause what matters most if the feeling\n\nYou get when you're hypnotized\n\nSeems like a dream\n\nThey got me hypnotized",
