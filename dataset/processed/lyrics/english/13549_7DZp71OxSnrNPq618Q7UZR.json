  "lyrics": "I thought for sure you were the end of me, oh\r\nI gave everything I could to you\r\nJust to see that loving smiling face\r\nIt wasn't in the cards for me and you\r\nThe problems blue\n\nI would have tried anything to save the contracts we made\n\nNot knowing it was you who wanted out, I couldn't save\n\nI would have tried anything to save what we made\n\nNot knowing it was you who wanted out\n\n\n\nNow the ship is sailing far away\n\nFrom the harbor of love and stability\n\nStabbing right where it hurts by my left lung\n\nAnd now the loneliness has just begun\n\n\n\nI would have tried anything to save the contracts we made\n\nNot knowing it was you who wanted out, I couldn't save\n\nI would have tried anything to save what we made\n\nNot knowing it was you who wanted out\n\n\n\nI gave you everything\n\nAll you needed was love\n\n\n\n(Never ever going to give my love again)\n\n(Never ever again)\n\n\n\nI would have tried anything to save the contracts we made\n\nNot knowing it was you who wanted out\n\n\n\nYou could have told me, you could have told me a long time ago\n\nYou could have told me, you could have told me so long ago\n\nYou could have told me, you could have told me a long time ago",
