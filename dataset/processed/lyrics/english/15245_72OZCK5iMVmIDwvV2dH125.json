  "lyrics": "What a tangle\r\nWhat a strangling knot to be caught in\r\nTo be exiled here\r\nTo be stuck in Berlin with Vienna so near\r\nYet so far from the Emperor's ear\r\nWhat a strange and impossible sum\n\nTo be old while to still be so young\n\nTo have sung before speaking a word\n\nTo be heard\n\nTo be hailed\n\nThen to fail\n\nTo be done\n\nTo love but to be so naive\n\nTo trust and to be so deceived\n\nTo mourn, forlorn, to be torn from you\n\nScorned for another who suffers no grief\n\nTo curse God, seeking lightning\n\nAnd to still be ignored\n\nTo hide in this room, now too rich to afford\n\nTo hear armies of creditors bang at the door\n\nAlways yelling for more\n\nAnd to have nothing to sell that could help\n\nExcept for the Steinway that sits in the corner\n\n\n\nFor Arthur it all came too easily\n\nTo learn the scales in every key\n\nTo play the etudes and the suites\n\nThe nocturnes and The Fantaisie\n\nTo master the sonatas, minuets, and symphonies\n\nTo seek the truth fits and starts\n\nTo strike the middle F like it's an arrow through the heart\n\nTo wing the right hand like a dove?(the peaceful flutter of a dove)\n\nAnd with left a violent shove?(some moments will demand a shove)\n\nTo needle gently yet relentless with a steady foot upon the pedal\n\nAnd to clench the iron first inside the velvet glove\n\nTo learn to whisper and to scream\n\n(the whisper justifies the scream)\n\nTo let each yearning finger breathe\n\n(no, nothing lives unless it breathes)\n\nTo burn, to worship, to mislead\n\nTo pose a question with a pinky on a key\n\nTo flee, to fight, to bleed\n\nTo float in air\n\nNothing solid underneath\n\nTo rap those heavy knuckles on the gate to heaven til there's nothing to\n\nAchieve, butÂ—\n\nTo go retrieve the length of cable hidden in the cabinet\n\nTo metamorphasize the twisted rope unto an alphabet\n\nTo lay the lazy C upon the shabby wooden floor to rest\n\nTo send the end across the top and bend the C into an S\n\nTo curve the tail beneath the S to turn the tangle to a B\n\nTo hug the wretched root around the fibers suffocatingly\n\nTo wrap again to wrap again to give the coil seven loops\n\nTo penetrate the yawning hoop\n\nTo tug the loose appendage through\n\nTo yank the knot until it's ready for the job ?it's got to do\n\nTo toss the braid above the ceiling beam and to affix the noose\n\nTo bid adieu to all of you? until there's nothing left to do but\n\nClimb the chair\n\nTo cinch the collar\n\nFind the edge\n\nTo step into the air",
