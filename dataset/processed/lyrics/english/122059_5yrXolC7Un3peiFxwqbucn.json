  "lyrics": "It's just you, it's just me\r\nI lost you in dreams\r\nNow I'm falling\r\nPlease don't catch, let me break\r\nInto pieces of hate\r\nStill I'm soaring\n\n\n\nKind of sad but you remind me\n\nYou remind me of a love that I once knew\n\nKind of sad but you remind me\n\nYou remind me of a love who outgrew me too\n\n\n\nHe released me into orbit\n\nStill I found a way to navigate to you\n\nHe released me into orbit\n\nStill I found a way to gravitate to you, oh\n\n\n\nYeah, he told me\n\nHere we are close to midnight\n\nSomething don't feel right\n\nWhere'd you go? Where'd you go?\n\nOn your rocket ship\n\nTake care you don't slip to a new realm\n\nI'll wait for ya by the hotel\n\nPlease pay my bills before you lose your\n\nHead over heels\n\nI don't care about this dog and you know I can't afford it\n\nI don't wanna get bigger\n\nGravity will hold me down like a sticker, yeah\n\nI release, I release you\n\nI don't need, I don't need\n\nIf I lose you, I lose you\n\nYou can give me the voodoo\n\nLike D'Angelo said, \"How does it, how does it feel?\"\n\nHe knew how it, how it would feel\n\n\n\nWhen he released me into orbit\n\nStill I found a way to navigate to you\n\nHe released me into orbit\n\nStill I found a way to gravitate to you\n\n\n\nOh no\n\nPlease don't say you're desertin', oh\n\nDon't leave me revolving\n\nI'm nearly dissolving, it's true\n\nPlease don't lie like the last time\n\nLeft me barely holding on\n\nWon't do this again\n\n'Cause I'll spin into infinite moons\n\n\n\nKinda sad but you remind me\n\nYou remind me of a love that I once knew\n\nKinda sad but you remind me\n\nYou remind me of a love who outgrew me too\n\n\n\nHe released me into orbit\n\nStill I found a way to gravitate to you\n\nHe released me into orbit\n\nStill I found a way to navigate to you\n\n\n\nI gravitate to you\n\nI gravitate to you\n\nI gravitate to you\n\nI gravitate to you, oh",
