  "lyrics": "I’m so tired of moving on\r\nSpending every weekend so far gone\r\nHeat wave, nothing to do\r\nWoke up in my clothes having dreamt of you\r\nSwirl in the white evening sun\n\nTell me that I'm the only one\n\nAnd I hope I never get a clue\n\nGreen eyes, I don’t know what to do\n\n\n\nAnd I hope whoever it is\n\nHolds their breath around you\n\nCause’ I know I did\n\n\n\nAnd otherwise\n\nIf only sometimes\n\nWould you give it up, green eyes?\n\n\n\nPassing phases wear you thin\n\nSame old world that you’ve been sleeping in\n\nAnd I hope it never spends you up\n\nGreen eyes, what could ever be enough?\n\n\n\nAnd I hope the love that you find\n\nSwallows you wholly\n\nLike you said it might\n\n\n\nAnd otherwise\n\nIf only sometimes\n\nWould you give it up, green eyes?\n\n\n\nI’m feeling low\n\nI’m not into sometimes",
