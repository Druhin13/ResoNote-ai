  "lyrics": "I see you thinking twice\r\nWish I could read your mind\r\nMove up or out of line\r\nToo late for praying\r\nI know we might lose our breath\r\nWe might be scared to death\n\nThis chance is like a step\n\nJust got to take it\n\n\n\nWhoa oh\n\nCountdown to here we go\n\n\n\nHold on tight, slide a little closer\n\nUp so high stars are on our shoulders\n\nTime fly's by, don't close your eyes\n\nKiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride\n\nWhat goes up might take us upside down\n\nLife ain't a merry go round\n\n\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\n\n\nCan't lie and won't pretend\n\nI know what's round the bend\n\nToo late to start again\n\nWon't take it slower\n\nLet's slip right off these tracks\n\nWe'll fly or we might crash\n\nDon't look down, don't look back\n\nCause it ain't over\n\n\n\nHold on tight, slide a little closer\n\nUp so high stars are on our shoulders\n\nTime fly's by, don't close your eyes\n\nKiss by kiss love is a like a thrill ride\n\nWhat goes up might take us upside down\n\nLife ain't a merry go round\n\n\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\n\n\nWhoa oh\n\nCountdown to here we go\n\n\n\nHold on tight, slide a bit closer\n\nUp so high the stars are on our shoulders\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\nKiss by kiss love is like a thrill ride\n\nWhat goes up might take us upside down\n\nLife ain't a merry go round\n\n\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\nIt's a roller coaster\n\nRoller coaster\n\nIt's a roller coaster",
