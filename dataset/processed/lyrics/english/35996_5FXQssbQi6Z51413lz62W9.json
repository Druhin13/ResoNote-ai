  "lyrics": "I was looking over at my shoulder\r\nOnly thinking of the short term\r\nBut time was looking back at me\r\nEvery day I eat an egg and soldier\r\nThen I sit a little longer\r\nOn a blanket made for three\n\n\n\nSwap cow for bean\n\nAnd grow a stalk\n\nTo tangle with the clouds\n\nPlant poems in the barren ground\n\nBlow doldrums round and round\n\n\n\nCut the brambles down\n\nSearch for heaven underground\n\nIt was lost but now its found\n\nFor we drank the ocean\n\nWe’ll play while Venice drowns\n\nSubmarines won’t save us now\n\nWe climbed a hill but then fell down\n\nWe climbed a hill but then fell down\n\nWe climbed a hill but then fell down\n\n\n\nI was looking over at my shoulder\n\nOnly thinking of the short term\n\nBut time was looking back at me\n\nEvery day I eat an egg and soldier\n\nThen I sit a little longer\n\nOn a blanket made for three\n\n\n\nSwap cow for bean\n\nAnd grow a stalk to tangle with the clouds\n\nPlant poems in the barren ground\n\nBlow doldrums round and round\n\n\n\nAll hail Tom Thumb\n\nWhats done is done\n\nYou'll never find the answer\n\n'till its gone",
