  "lyrics": "Your heart's on the loose\r\nYou rolled them sevens with nothing to lose\r\nThis ain't no place for the weary kind\r\nYou called all your shots\r\nShooting eight ball at the corner truck stop\n\nSomehow this don't feel like home anymore\n\n\n\nAnd this ain't no place for the weary kind\n\nAnd this ain't no place to lose your mind\n\nThis ain't no place to fall behind\n\nPick up your crazy heart and give it one more try\n\n\n\nYour body aches\n\nPlaying your guitar, sweating out the hate\n\nThe days and the nights all feel the same\n\n\n\nWhiskey has been a thorn in your side\n\nIt doesn't forget\n\nThe highway that calls for your heart inside\n\n\n\nAnd this ain't no place for the weary kind\n\nThis ain't no place to lose your mind\n\nThis ain't no place to fall behind\n\nPick up your crazy heart and give it one more try\n\n\n\nYour lover's warm kiss\n\nIs too damn far from your fingertips\n\nYou are the man that ruined her world\n\n\n\nYour heart's on the loose\n\nYou rolled them sevens with nothing to lose\n\nAnd this ain't no place for the weary kind",
