  "lyrics": "Lily was a little girl\r\nAfraid of the big, wide world\r\nShe grew up within her castle walls\r\nNow and then she tried to run\r\nAnd then on the night with the setting sun\r\nShe went in the woods away\n\nSo afraid, all alone\n\n\n\nThey want her, don’t go there\n\nThere’s creatures who are hiding in the dark\n\nThen something came creeping\n\nIt told her\n\n\n\nDon’t you worry just follow everywhere I go\n\nTop over the mountains of valley low\n\nGive you everything you’ve been dreaming of\n\nJust let me in\n\nEverything you wanted gotta be the magic story you’ve been told\n\nAnd you’ll be safe under my control\n\nJust let me in\n\nJust let me in\n\n\n\nShe knew she was hypnotised\n\nAnd walking on cold thin ice\n\nThen it broke, and she awoke again\n\nThen she ran faster than\n\nStart screaming, is there someone out there?\n\nPlease help me\n\nCome get me\n\nBehind her, she can hear it say\n\n\n\nFollow everywhere I go\n\nTop over the mountains of valley low\n\nGive you everything you’ve been dreaming of\n\nJust let me in\n\nEverything you wanted gotta be the magic story you’ve been told\n\nAnd you’ll be safe under my control\n\nJust let me in\n\nJust let me in\n\n\n\nEverything you wanted gotta be the magic story you’ve been told\n\nAnd you’ll be safe under my control\n\nJust let me in\n\n\n\nFollow everywhere I go\n\nTop over the mountains of valley low\n\nGive you everything you’ve been dreaming of\n\nJust let me in\n\nThen she ran faster than\n\nStart screaming, is there someone out there?\n\nPlease help me\n\nJust let me in",
