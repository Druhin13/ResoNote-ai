'cause\r\nEffortless, girl, the way you grow\r\nSo effortless, baby, that's why I love you\n\nYou got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook up off your lovin'\n\nSo effortless so effortless\n\n\n\nFolarin, hol' up\n\nNever trust a big butt and a smile\n\nI been sippin' poison that's brown\n\nI've been here, but I've been low key\n\nCan't nobody say they've seen me around\n\nI got circumstances that got my circumference workin' backwards\n\nMy circle's small as a barber shop in a Rasta mansion\n\nLockin' with you as I unravel the possibilities\n\nWhen not with you I just miss your body, I got your energy\n\nGucci startin' to bore you ain't it\n\nYou rather patience and conversation\n\nShe mature, but she still a baby\n\n'Cause she get a check but still check my pages\n\n\n\nEffortless, girl, the way you grow\n\nSo effortless, baby, that's why I love you\n\nYou got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook up off your lovin'\n\nSo effortless so effortless\n\n\n\nWould you rather me put in work or be shy, baby?\n\nWould you rather me say you're perfect and lie, baby?\n\nWrite my name up in cursive between your thighs baby\n\nWould you rather me thirsty and you dehydrated?\n\nI got the feelin' I'm catchin' feelings I can't fade 'em\n\nCasual love is innocent but to care is fatal, uh\n\nIt's embarrassing carin' for some people\n\nThe heart you wear that's on your sleeve is there to mislead 'em, uh\n\nI know I'm petty and immature and I know\n\nI've been hurt before shouldn't be the source of my cold heart\n\nMaybe shawty could be the first\n\nTo show me how to love on a level where effort doesn't work\n\n\n\nEffortless, girl, the way you grow\n\nSo effortless, baby, that's why I love you\n\nYou got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook up off your lovin'\n\nSo effortless so effortless\n\n\n\nI wanted to that natural beauty\n\nAre you even real?\n\nAre you doin' this to me?\n\nYou're my favorite thrill\n\nAnd there is no rush\n\nBut I think the universe is speaking to us\n\n\n\nEffortless, girl, the way you grow\n\nSo effortless, baby, that's why I love you\n\nYou got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook up off your lovin'\n\nSo effortless so effortless",
