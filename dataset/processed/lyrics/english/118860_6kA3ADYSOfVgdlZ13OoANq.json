  "lyrics": "There's a few more churches than there are bars\r\nA hell of a lot more trucks than there are cars\r\nIf the sun’s still hangin' in the sky\r\nWork day still ain't done\r\nWhere I come from\n\nYou bow your head and pray before you eat\n\nThere ain’t a single stranger on the streets\n\nThere's a lot of nowhere towns out there\n\nBut for me there's only one\n\nWhere I come from\n\n\n\nSo if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night\n\nAnd if I never learn how to back down from a fight\n\nAnd if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes\n\nAnd If I just can't seem to shut it down\n\nThat's just my \"where I come from\" comin' out\n\n\n\nWhen I shake your hand I'm gonna look you in the eye\n\nAnd if I’m wrong, I’ll apologize\n\nI'm still tryin’ to live by a couple things I pick up\n\nWhere I come from\n\n\n\nSo if I like my music just a little too loud\n\nAnd I got a couple tattoos to show my Georgia pride\n\nAnd if what's on my mind is what's comin' out my mouth\n\nAnd If I just can’t seem to shut it down\n\nThat's just my \"where I come from\" comin' out\n\n\n\nGot a lot of good, got a little bit of bad from it\n\nMade me what I am, got everything I have from it\n\n\n\nSo if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night\n\nAnd if I never learn how to back down from a fight\n\nAnd if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes\n\nAnd If I just can't seem to shut it down\n\nThat's just my \"where I come from' comin\" out\n\n\"Where I come from\" comin' out",
