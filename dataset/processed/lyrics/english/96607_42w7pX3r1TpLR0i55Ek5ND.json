  "lyrics": "Taking off, turn off the lights\r\nWe're so in denial of breaking up, we make it up\r\nEvery time I look in your eyes, I’m back in love\r\nI've waited all my life, for someone like you\r\nBut I'm losing sight of your point of view\n\n\n\nAre we broken? Lost in emotion\n\nAre you all in? Are you bluffing?\n\nIs this the last fight? Lay here one last night\n\nI know we’re both tired, that's our excuse\n\nAre you all in? Are you bluffing?\n\n\n\nIt's no one's fault, that's what they say\n\nYou want it your way, you know it all\n\nWe said its no one's fault, losing our minds\n\nLie after lie, fake love\n\n\n\nWe had a hell of a ride\n\nIssues aside, both of us\n\n\n\nAre we broken? Lost in emotion (Lost in the moment)\n\nAre you all in? Are you bluffing?\n\nIs this the last fight? Lay here one last night\n\nI know we're both tired, that's our excuse\n\nAre you all in? Are you bluffing?\n\n\n\nAre you, mmm, ooh\n\nAre you, oh",
