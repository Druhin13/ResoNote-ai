  "lyrics": "Feels like I spent my whole life planning out my whole life\r\nTryna make it feel right when it don't\r\nI know I picked the wrong ones just to have someone\r\n'Cause who likes to be alone?\r\nI had a couple heartbreaks, made my share of mistakes\r\nThought that kinda love wasn't meant for me\n\nBut looking at you across this room\n\nFeels like this could be\n\n\n\nOne of those nights, starts with a smile\n\nOne of those smiles turns to a drink\n\nOne of those drinks leads to a song\n\nYou and me dancing all night long\n\nOne of those dances leads to a kiss\n\nOne of those kisses feels like forever\n\nOne of those nights you start as strangers\n\nOne of those nights when everything changes\n\nYeah, when everything changes\n\n\n\nNow you got me laughing, I haven't been laughing\n\nQuite like this in quite a while\n\nNow you got me thinking like I've been drinking\n\nMore than I've been drinking here tonight\n\nLike heaven in a black dress it ain't even late yet\n\nI can see the morning in your eyes\n\nI don't dance, girl, but I wanna dance with you\n\nThis is feeling like it might be\n\n\n\nOne of those nights, starts with a smile\n\nOne of those smiles turns to a drink\n\nOne of those drinks leads to a song\n\nYou and me dancing all night long\n\nOne of those dances leads to a kiss\n\nOne of those kisses feels like forever\n\nOne of those nights you start as strangers\n\nOne of those nights when everything changes\n\nYeah, everything changes\n\n\n\nI swear someday we'll look back and say\n\nRemember that time, remember that place?\n\nYou first took my breath away\n\n\n\nOne of those nights, starts with a smile\n\nOne of those smiles turns to a drink\n\nOne of those drinks leads to a song\n\nYou and me dancing all night long\n\nOne of those dances leads to a kiss\n\nOne of those kisses feels like forever\n\nOne of those nights you start as strangers\n\nOne of those nights when everything changes\n\nYeah, everything changes\n\n\n\nEverything changes\n\nStart as strangers\n\nEverything changes",
