  "lyrics": "I took a night shift another nickel on the dime, try to play it straight and make it different this time, still waiting to meet the next ex-wife\nIt's either watching these gauges for Monsanto, or a bar-back job for the casino, the Army won't want me after what this body's been through\n\nWould you take me back North Carolina? Would you take me back Arkansas?\nBlissful days still there to remember, methamphetamine was the final straw\n\n\nI had a killer job in a backup band playin' guitar in Branson\n\nTwo shows a night brought the money to chase down sin\n\nNow it's another weekend and I'm lonely at home, late night tv evangelist drone, I'm healthy now but I really don't know if I'll ever be free\n\n\n\nWould you take me back North Carolina? Would you take me back Arkansas?\n\nBlissful days still there to remember, methamphetamine was the final straw",
