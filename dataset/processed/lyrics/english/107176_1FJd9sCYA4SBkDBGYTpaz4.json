  "lyrics": "What kind of love love have you got ? You should be home but you're not \nA room full of noise and dangerous boys still make you thirsty and hot \nI heard about you and that man\r\nThere's just one thing I don't understand: \nYou say he's a liar and he put out your fire \nHow come you still got his gun in your hand ? \n\nVictim of love, I see a broken heart \n\nYou got your stories to tell \n\nVictim of love, it's such an easy part \n\nAnd you know how to play it so well. \n\nSome people never come clean \n\nI think you know what I mean \n\nYou're walking the wire of pain and desire \n\nLookin' for love in between. \n\nTell me your secrets I'll tell you mine \n\nThis ain't no time to be cool \n\nSo tell all your girl friends, your 'been-around-the-world-friends \n\nThat talk is for losers and fools \n\nVictim of love, I see a broken heart \n\nAnd I could be wrong but I'm not \n\nVictim of love, we're not so far apart \n\nShow me, what kind of love have you got",
