  "lyrics": "Fame and fortune\r\nhow empty they can be\r\nBut when I hold you in my arms\r\nThat's heaven to me\r\nWho cares for fame and fortune\r\nThey're only passing things\n\nBut the touch of your lips on mine\n\nMakes me feel like a king\n\n\n\nYour kind of love\n\nis a treasure I hold\n\nIt's so much greater\n\nthan silver or gold\n\nI know that I have nothing\n\nIf you should go away\n\nBut to know that you love me\n\nBrings fame and fortune my way",
