  "lyrics": "When the fog has lifted and the winter's gone\r\nAnd the songs, they visit and we carry on\r\nAnd in the light of the day\r\nGravel will sink, I watch them as they drive away\r\nI didn't even know your name\n\nBut I got on my knees and prayed\n\n\n\nI just wanna feel peace, please\n\nThrow back the curtain, make me feel certain\n\nI'm free, believe\n\nTake away my burden, make me stop hurting me\n\nPlease, I just wanna feel peace\n\n\n\nThe sun, it dances on a landscaped lawn\n\nThe echo of it lingers on\n\n\n\nI wanted it to be like it\n\nWas back when we were only kids, ooh\n\nWe were only kids\n\n\n\nI just wanna feel peace, please\n\nThrow back the curtain, make me feel certain\n\nI'm free, believe\n\nTake away my burden, make me stop hurting me\n\n\n\nI just wanna feel peace, please\n\nThrow back the curtain, make me feel certain\n\nI'm free, believe\n\nTake away my burden, make me stop hurting me\n\nPlease, I just wanna feel peace",
