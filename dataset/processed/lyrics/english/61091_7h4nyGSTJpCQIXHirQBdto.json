[5 seconds instrumental]\n\n[Chorus: Angel]\n\nYou get up and then you fall flat, [echoes]\n\nEven when you give your all back, [echoes]\n\nThey try to tell you where your heart's at, [echoes]\n\nSomeone tell me what you call that!\n\nI beliieeve, - I beliieeve it's never enoouugh!\n\nI beliieeve it's neveeer, - neveeer enough!\n\nI beliieeve it's neveeer, - neveeer eno-oouu-ugh!\n\nNeveeer, - neveeer enough! - Everythiiing - is neveeer, - neveeer eno-oouu-ugh!\n\n\n\n[Chamillionaire:]\n\nI'm thinkin' 'bout all of the people I went harder for,\n\nWhile I read the Holy Scripture like it's \"Art of War\".\n\nPretty women and skinny dippin'; Where the party, boys?\n\nSkippin' the crib like I ain't get to book an honest tour.\n\nIf I wasn't ready you never seen it all before, (what else?)\n\nPro'ly keep a loaded weapon up in armored drawers. (armoed drawers!)\n\nCause I know the people envious of marble floors; (marble floors!)\n\nIf everybody had the answers, it would all be yours! (WHOOOO!)\n\nSuccess could've ran from me, I said: \"I would've caught you! \"\n\nYou couldn't just be the person I open my arms to!\n\nIt could've been something said that I'd never respond to;\n\nOr you couldn't just give a reason for me to assault you!\n\nYou couldn't just work it out with somebody you talked to,\n\nThat could've been somethin' that someone else never taught you!\n\nYou could've been legendary if you had the heart to;\n\nThat could've been something that wouldn't come back to haunt you. - Whassup?\n\n\n\n[Chorus: Angel (Chamillionaire)]\n\nYou get up and then you fall flat, [echoes]\n\nEven when you give your all back, [echoes]\n\nThey try to tell you where your heart's at, (they try to tell you where your he-eeeaaa-art's at!)\n\nSomeone tell me what you call that!\n\nI beliieeve, (I beliieeve!) - I beliieeve it's never enoouugh! (it's just never enough!)\n\nI beliieeve it's neveeer, - neveeer enough! (it's just never enough)\n\nI beliieeve it's neveeer, - neveeer eno-oouu-ugh!\n\nNeveeer, - neveeer enough! - Everythiiing - is neveeer, - neveeer eno-oouu-ugh!\n\n\n\n[Chamillionaire:]\n\nTell 'em you wanna do it, they'll say that it's cruelest pride!\n\nPour your heart out and they actin' like someone lied. (lied!)\n\nWhen you stand up for somethin', they'll treat you like someone died!\n\nBut if you stand up for nothin', just call it a homicide!\n\nTold me to fear God. Now tell me is that coward?!\n\nMainly kid, X's the symbol of black power! (power!)\n\nYou just plottin' the scheme and remain in that tower,\n\nLactose intolerant to your damsel that's sour.\n\nDo anythin' for the money, but tell me: \"What does it mean?! \" (mean!)\n\nIf money's everything, get it; and tell me: \"What else it bring?! \" (brings!)\n\nThe pedal pull out the metal; which of your crew'll sing?\n\nYou puppet? You'd better duck it or learn the pull of the strings.\n\n\n\n[Bridge: Chamillionaire]\n\nSend the kites of federal through the bank,\n\nThey sell their souls for soles and Jordan's and foolish things! (things!)\n\nCareful, the truth stings, I know that you had a dream\n\nBut ain't no Martin Luther King's out on Martin Luther King!\n\n\n\n[Chamillionaire:]\n\nHold up! - Let someone tell me what you call that! (call that!)\n\nThey think you're beneath 'em, so they think they can walk over you like a doormat.\n\nThe only way that I could solve that (solve that!)\n\nGet on the beats, spit all this heat! Drink to the heart and get an all clap!\n\nCause this apparently therapy, I'm hysterically\n\nLaughin' at anybody who thinkin' they could embarrass me!\n\nEven if carelessly do the words that I'm inherently\n\nPassing to y'all, but I ain't gotta do necessarily! (naaah!)\n\nWhy should I bother? I know that I'm not your father!\n\nYou'll never become a baller! I never slept with your mama!\n\nYou'll never become a bomber! You'll never get any commas!\n\nYou'll never get anything in your life - but plenty drama! (what else?)\n\nI set the presidents from my little seed;\n\nThey cut me? I'm a bounce back like I'm Shaheen Reid.\n\nI'll require all the enemies that I didn't need,\n\nSee? Real recognize real and that's why I can't see no one but meeeeeeee!\n\n\n\n[Outro: Angel]\n\nNeveeer eno-oouu-ugh...\n\nNever eeeeeeeee-noouugh!\n\nNeveeer eno-oouu-ugh...\n\nNever eeeeeeeee-noouugh!\n\n\n\n[Bridge: Chamillionaire]\n\nSend the kites of federal through the bank, [beat fades-out]\n\nThey sell their souls for soles and Jordan's and foolish things!\n\nCareful, the truth stings, I know that you had a dream [beat stops]\n\nBut ain't no Martin Luther King's out on \"Martin Luther King\"!
