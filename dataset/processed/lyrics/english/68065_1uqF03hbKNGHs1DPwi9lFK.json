  "lyrics": "The memories of life we see\r\nWe find a reason\r\nTo realize together\r\nTomorrow holds another day\r\nWe look for answers\n\nWe will fight to rise\n\n\n\nYour time is over\n\nFollow my truth\n\nThat the world is ending\n\nFeel the lies through\n\nYour leaders hands\n\n\n\nFollow me, the time has come\n\nWeâ€™ll change the world from the light\n\nI will guide you there\n\n\n\nTrust in the faction\n\nFollow my path\n\nThe fire between us\n\nCall onto the world above",
