  "lyrics": "When it's closing time in late September\r\nAnd the street lights search for shadows on my mind\r\nWhen the bars all holler last call and the moon’s on her descent\r\nI stagger towards the morning, a new day to begin\r\nCounting down to closing time again\n\nShe swears my youthful glow is only hiding\n\nJust beyond the borders of my mind\n\nBut these rollin' hills don't bind me, they simply remind me\n\nThe sun is sinking low, and all I’ve left behind me\n\nCounting down to closing time again\n\n\n\nDarlin' I've been thinking, is it selfish pride\n\nKeeps a man from sharing all the tears he hides?\n\n\n\n‘Cause when it's closing time in late September\n\nAnd the summer turns slowly into fall\n\nOur mother, with such splendor, dies in brilliant color\n\nThoughts once put together by a hospital room window\n\nCounting down to closing time again\n\n\n\n\n\nDarlin' I've been thinking, is it selfish pride\n\nKeeps a man from sharing all the tears he hides?\n\n\n\n‘Cause when it's closing time in late September\n\nIt's hard to hide how much I miss her so\n\nAs a tenderness of memories unfolds itself within me\n\nWith such gravity unyielding in the land of the living\n\nCounting down to closing time again",
