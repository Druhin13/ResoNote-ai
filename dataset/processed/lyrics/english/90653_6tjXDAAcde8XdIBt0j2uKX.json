  "lyrics": "I am this now, a little bit different\r\nBut I guess that's what life will do\r\nIn the same town, but it's not so innocent\r\nGrowing up but it feels too soon, it feels too soon\r\nThe pressure, my head hurts\n\nYou think it get better, not worse\n\nI am this now, but I'm not so innocent\n\nAnd I lay here, I don't wanna go to sleep alone\n\n'Cause when I look out my window\n\n\n\nI'm scared it's not fireworks anymore\n\nI'm scared it's not fireworks anymore\n\nOutside is not the same, not like it was before\n\nI hope I heard fireworks outside of my door\n\n\n\nWhen I'm walking I get a little bit paranoid\n\nBy everyone, every noise\n\nLet the phone ring\n\n'Cause there's some shit I'm avoiding, yeah\n\n\n\nThe pressure, my head hurts\n\nYou think it get better, not worse\n\nI am this now, but I'm not so innocent\n\nAnd I lay here, I don't wanna go to sleep alone\n\n'Cause when I look out my window\n\n\n\nI'm scared it's not fireworks anymore\n\nI'm scared it's not fireworks anymore\n\nOutside is not the same, not like it was before\n\nI hope I heard fireworks outside of my door\n\n\n\nOutside of my door, ooh\n\nMy door, ooh\n\nAnd I lay here, I don't wanna go to sleep alone\n\n'Cause when I look out my window\n\n\n\nI'm scared it's not fireworks anymore\n\nI'm scared it's not fireworks anymore\n\nOutside is not the same, not like it was before\n\nI hope I heard fireworks outside of my door (My door, yeah)",
