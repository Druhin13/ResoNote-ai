  "lyrics": "Shoot [gunshots]\r\nTrust the fuckin' shooter\r\nBeing feared goes farther than any part of me having respect does\r\nSo I play to the tune of my own eardrum\r\nWhile I'm out on my quest, love\n\nI don't speak on behalf of myself, but my impeccable rep does\n\nChristmas morning I remember waking up wishin' I could just go to sleep\n\nCause we only got like two toys a piece\n\nI ask my pops did he do more for me?\n\nHe said \"yes, I got you clothes and heat\n\nAnd let you keep a whole two rows of teeth\"\n\nHa, I'm royalty\n\nI took whoopin's, I took losses, but no defeats\n\nBeen dropped, and been shelved with no release\n\nBeen in jail, no commissary or relief\n\nBut God looks over me like a cross and rosary\n\nRifle in hand, I let niggas have it, I won't hesitate\n\nWrites on the cans in the cabinet \"section eight\"\n\nMy son got on them three-fifty boots Kanye West is dressed in bape\n\nAskin' me questions 'bout gettin' to second base\n\nUhh, wifey textin' SMH, house phone ringin' off the hook\n\nConference calls from record labels, guess I'm late\n\nBut, my other son's autistic, he wants my attention\n\nThis might just be my defining moment, let them wait\n\n\n\nIt's my time now, nigga; let them wait\n\nPick up the phone, tell 'em hold; let them wait\n\nOld friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile\n\nAfter I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait\n\n\n\nWait, I'm here for that green, for that mula\n\nYou scheme, I see right through ya\n\nI'm regal like a King Father, King as Zamunda\n\nOne thing's for sure I think they do know\n\nThat me, and Porter, and Jake Uno\n\nWe don't play no games, no, we play sumo\n\nWe attempt to flatten into action\n\nWith all these average, flacid defenseless rappers\n\nI have no problem killing like sent assassins\n\nThey temper's bad when my temper's graphic\n\nThey hide or they fly while I'm high and flyer\n\nI'm intergalactic, I've been spectacular\n\nFlippin' like I invented spatulas, my lyrics is futuristic\n\nI'm in here with my vintage ratchet with Princess [?]\n\nMy mental action-ly incapacitates fast as my passion\n\nAnd pen surpasses my Aston\n\nAnd leave a skid road in the street like I'm into smackin'\n\nI fill my engine with acid\n\nWith my finger wrapped around a hair-trigger that resembles lashes\n\nI get into bitches quick and then I get distracted\n\nI'm like the stock market, just like that, my interest crashes\n\nLike a symbol, my symbol should be expensive glasses\n\nShe with me, she a afro-centric nympho chick with a ass did\n\nShe callin' me back-to-back for a second date\n\nWhile my ex is callin' for make-up-dick -- let them wait\n\nMoney all over the ground like Scotty from New Jack City, I weapon wave\n\nEverybody, step away\n\nThey said that we should go our separate ways, in high school Now they wanna jump the line in my shows -- let them wait\n\nMy whole life, they pressured me -- let them wait\n\nYou rushin' me you rushin' excellence -- let them wait\n\nPolice in my rear-view mirror with they sirens on\n\nBut I'm a call my lawyer first 'fore I pull over -- let them wait\n\n\n\nIt's my time now, nigga, let them wait\n\nPick up the phone, tell them hold, let them wait\n\nOld friends comin' to they senses tryna' reconcile\n\nAfter I fell out with them, well fuck them niggas; let them wait",
