  "lyrics": "(Tom Petty and Mike Campbell)\r\nI remember you so clearly\r\nThe first one through the door\r\nI return to find you drifting\r\nToo far from the shore\n\n\n\nI remember feeling this way\n\nYou can lose it without knowing\n\nYou wake up and you don't notice\n\nWhich way the wind is blowing\n\n\n\nDon't fade\n\nDon't fade on me\n\n\n\nYou were the one who made things different\n\nYou were the one who took me in\n\nYou were the one thing I could count on\n\nAbove all you were my friend\n\n\n\nDon't fade\n\nDon't fade on me\n\n\n\nWell your clothes hang on a wire\n\nAnd the sun is overhead\n\nBut today you are too weary\n\nTo even leave your bed\n\n\n\nWas it love that took you under?\n\nOr did you know too much?\n\nWas it something you could picture?\n\nBut never could quite touch?\n\n\n\nDon't fade\n\nDon't fade on me",
