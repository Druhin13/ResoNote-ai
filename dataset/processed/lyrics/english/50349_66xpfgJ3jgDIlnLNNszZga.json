  "lyrics": "I see you in the morning\r\nFeel your fingers in my hair\r\nSometimes I still pretend you're there\r\nIt hits me without warning\r\nYour reflection walking by\n\nBut I know it's only in my mind\n\n\n\nWill you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?\n\nWon't you give me the part of myself that I can't get back?\n\nWill you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?\n\n'Cause I'd kill for you\n\nAnd darling you know that\n\n\n\nSo I'll light up a cigarette\n\nI'll drink it down til there's nothing left\n\n'Cause I sure can't get no sleep\n\nAnd Lord knows there's no relief\n\nYou held my heart in your fingertips\n\nSo now I drown in my bitterness\n\nOh, I can't get no sleep\n\nAnd I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace\n\nNo peace\n\n\n\nAll that I am asking\n\nIs for a little clarity\n\nThat's all that really matters to me\n\n\n\nIn and out of focus\n\nTears are in my eyes\n\nWe're burning down the bridges this time\n\n\n\nWill you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?\n\nWon't you give me the part of myself that I can't get back?\n\nWill you show me the piece of my heart I've been missing?\n\n'Cause I'd kill for you\n\nAnd darling you know that\n\n\n\nSo I'll light up a cigarette\n\nI'll drink it down til there's nothing left\n\n'Cause I sure can't get no sleep (no sleep)\n\nAnd Lord knows there's no relief\n\nYou held my heart in your fingertips\n\nSo now I drown in my bitterness\n\nOh, I can't get no sleep \n\nAnd I sure won't, I sure won't find...\n\n\n\nI used to find comfort in your arms\n\nCaught up in the wonder of your charms\n\nI'll cry for you, I'll cry for you\n\nI'd lie for you, I'd lie for you\n\nBut I don't even know you anymore\n\n\n\nSo I'll light up a cigarette\n\nI'll drink it down til there's nothing left\n\n'Cause I sure can't get no sleep\n\nAnd Lord knows there's no relief\n\nYou held my heart in your fingertips\n\nSo now I drown in my bitterness\n\nOh, I can't get no sleep\n\nAnd I sure won't, I sure won't find no peace\n\nSure won't find no peace\n\n\n\nWill you give me the piece, will you give me the piece of my heart?\n\nWill you give me the piece, will you give me the piece of my heart?",
