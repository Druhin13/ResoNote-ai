  "lyrics": "The curse of the night\r\nIs all he could say\r\nWhen he woke to find\r\nHis life slipping away\r\nHe watched his car\r\nDriving off the cliff\n\nAnd then he blacked out\n\nAnd the rest he missed\n\n\n\nHe came so close, close, close\n\nThat night\n\n\n\nWhen the curse of the night\n\nIt can't be blamed\n\nShe took a chance\n\nSwore never again\n\nKept riding along\n\nFate's unforgiving edge\n\nGave him her heart\n\nNow he's halfway dead\n\n\n\nThey came so close, close, close\n\nThat night\n\n\n\nStrange how coincidence\n\nDoesn't need a reason\n\nChoosing a victim\n\nWhose story can be broken\n\n\n\nYou can curse the night\n\nBut it won't do any good\n\nYou can curse the night\n\nWon't do any good\n\nNo good at all\n\nWon't do you any good\n\nNo good at all\n\nNo good at all\n\nNo good at all\n\nNo good at all\n\nNo good at all\n\nNo good at all",
