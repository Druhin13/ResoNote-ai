  "lyrics": "I've been sober\r\nFeel like I've been sober all my life\r\nI tread water\r\nAnd I hold on to things too tight, too tight\r\nThen you come on just like the best drugs, baby\n\nYou take over like the best drugs, baby\n\n\n\nI love it, I can get so high on you\n\nTell them they can meet me on the moon\n\nPull me thru just like the best drugs, baby\n\nFelling like I'm not the only one\n\nFeeling like I'm plugged in to the sun\n\nYou come on just like the best drugs, baby\n\n\n\nI hear music\n\nFeels like I'm swimming in the sea, in the sea\n\nJust sweet soul music\n\nAnd it just washes over me\n\nIt's all the faith I need\n\n\n\nYou come on just like the best drugs, baby\n\nYou take over like the best drugs, baby\n\n\n\nI love it, I can get so high on you\n\nTell them they can meet me on the moon\n\nPull me thru just like the best drugs, baby\n\nFelling like I'm not the only one\n\nFeeling like I'm plugged in to the sun\n\nYou come on just like the best drugs, baby\n\n\n\nI can see the beauty in the mess and imperfections\n\nWhen you're running through me I get pulled in all directions\n\nSwallowed by the beauty and lost in inspiration\n\n\n\nI love it, I can get so high on you\n\nTell them they can meet me on the moon\n\nPull me thru just like the best drugs, baby\n\nFelling like I'm not the only one\n\nFeeling like I'm plugged in to the sun\n\nYou come on just like the best drugs, baby\n\n\n\nI love it, I can get so high on you\n\nTell them they can meet me on the moon\n\nPull me thru just like the best drugs, baby\n\nFelling like I'm not the only one\n\nFeeling like I'm plugged in to the sun\n\nYou come on just like the best drugs, baby",
