  "lyrics": "Blue collar Eddie and his better half Delores used to be mantel pieces down at the Black Forest. \nAnd I don't know if that bar still exists, but when it did, so did they, a couple bleeding heart kids. \nEverything volatile, every night rocker style. Hop a stool, be discrete and just watch a while. \nBut do your best to keep the level observational, drama is attractive so push it when it takes a pull. \nAnd each night's a random when you pay a ransom for the right to sing along with them drinking anthems. \nAnd these fools paid so many dues that everybody stops to salute. \n\n\n\nBut one night after another fight a couple from an opposite table offered an invite. \n\nDolores didn't want to join 'em, wasn't feeling social. \n\nBut Eddie was so aggravated that he had to poke holes. \n\nHe walked over, sat in the dialogue and called at Dolores like some kind of dog (\"hey girl come here\")\n\nShe can't believe it, she's done, she's had it, but she doesn't want to make another scene in this establishment. \n\nShe got up and mosied over, and put her arm up around Eddie's shoulder. \n\nNobody's sober the song is the same; sometimes you stick out your chin to catch the rain.\n\n\n\nYou can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster.\n\nSometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes.\n\nYou can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster.\n\nSometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes.\n\n\n\nThe clock keeps drinking, they keep ticking. There's two more people who get to play positions. \n\nSamantha and Chuck; not a couple, just roommates; out having too many shots on a Tuesday. \n\nWho knew they'd be tools for the duo, put a little bit of fire on the fuel. \n\nIt's a kinda blue, intentions ain't cruel, but everybody's so ready to bend up the rules.\n\nNow there's Chuck, staring at Delores. \n\nEddie is distracted by Samantha so he doesn't notice. \n\nAnd everybody's too fucked up to even asses the mess, much less care enough. \n\nMore whiskey, a pitcher of Premium, Eddie's getting tipsy, he didn't see it comin. \n\nOn his way back from a visit with that urinal, tryna straighten out his thoughts and the vertigo. \n\nWeaves through, stops when he's seen em. \n\nPicture perfect, it looked just like freedom;\n\nDolores on Chuck's lap kissing him hard. Eddie dipped into the winter left them all at the bar. \n\nSometimes ya gotta follow what's felt inside; between the power struggle and the selfish pride. \n\nNo one's allowed to cry unfair because now they both get to drink alone somewhere. \n\n\n\nYou can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster\n\nSometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes\n\nYou can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster\n\nSometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes\n\nYou can be a winner, you can be a loser, gotta wake up when you hear the rooster\n\nSometimes it's just too simple to live your life wrong, gotta do what right for you when the time comes\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Karen for these lyrics)",
