Best friends 'til the end, amen\n\nRide around in the box, \"Guilty Conscience,\" Eminem\n\nGrowing up too fast, no bars over no hoes\n\nNo high is too high, no bottle is too low\n\nPack it up, let it burn, pass it, my turn\n\nLet me hit one more time\n\nLet me live, let me learn\n\nWho am I for you to judge?\n\nWho are you? It's just drugs\n\nIt's only weed, it's only pills\n\nIt's my dope, it's my buzz\n\nOne time, one try, then I say bye\n\nI'm lying, I can't stop now, and why?\n\nI tried this, I tried that, I came clean, my act\n\nTook five yellow pills, passed out, came back\n\nD.U.I. sometimes, too lit, can't drive\n\nI made it home, I survived, I shouldn't be alive\n\nMy bad, my fault, I'm just an alco'\n\nShoot 'em up, bang-bang, no chase, no salt\n\n\n\nI got a question for you, please don't tell nobody\n\n\"Boy, do you get high?\" I said, \"All the time\"\n\nWe got a secret, baby, I won't tell nobody\n\n\"When do you get high?\" She said, \"All the time\"\n\nGive me a lesson, baby, teach me something new\n\nI said, \"I'll be your guy,\" She said, \"Give me a try\"\n\nWe got a secret, baby, we won't tell nobody\n\nYou and me get high, all the time\n\n\n\n(Drugs)\n\n(Drugs)",
