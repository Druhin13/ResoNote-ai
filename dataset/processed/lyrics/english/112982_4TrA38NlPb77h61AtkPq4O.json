  "lyrics": "Sailing heart-ships\r\nthru broken harbors\r\nOut on the waves in the night\r\nStill the searcher\r\nmust ride the dark horse\r\nRacing alone in his fright.\n\nTell me why, tell me why\n\n\n\nIs it hard to make\n\narrangements with yourself,\n\nWhen you're old enough to repay\n\nbut young enough to sell?\n\n\n\nTell me lies later,\n\ncome and see me\n\nI'll be around for a while.\n\nI am lonely but you can free me\n\nAll in the way that you smile\n\nTell me why, tell me why\n\n\n\nIs it hard to make\n\narrangements with yourself,\n\nWhen you're old enough to repay\n\nbut young enough to sell?\n\n\n\nTell me why, tell me why\n\nTell me why, tell me why",
