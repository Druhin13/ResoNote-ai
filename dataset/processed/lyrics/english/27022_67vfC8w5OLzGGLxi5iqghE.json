  "lyrics": "This right here’s that clutch Get Ready to feel that rush Demonstrating Propagation for those who can’t get enough\r\nNo I never found my luck\r\nBut I just can’t give up I gather my thoughts mind and guts\r\nAnd just let sound erupt\r\nThis is that Midwest adrenaline\n\nDiscrepancies in the building\n\nProgression from aggression we’re destined to hurt some feelings We’re bringing it raw, incredible performance without a warning\n\nWe leave them in awe, now you feel taunted cause now you’re cornered\n\nSee the ones without a clue will picture you as a failure, but that high horsed view it will truly impale ya\n\nRewrite your life’s work change the price and sell ya, promised you nice jewels\n\nAnd now you do what they tell ya huh?\n\n\n\nThis is the awakening\n\nNo more complacency, I’m done\n\nWe gotta break from the safety\n\nCause my mistakes are what made me\n\nYou can say that I’m crazy but know that You won’t break me\n\n\n\nYou know we’re too amped up\n\nAdrenaline you can’t touch\n\nNo hesitation I’ve awakened\n\nThere’s no way you can break me\n\nNo I never found my luck\n\nGiving that sound so nuts\n\nI gather my thoughts mind and guts\n\nAnd just let sound erupt\n\nThis life’s a prison, regardless got to live it\n\nGot me sitting hoping wishing\n\nTrying to bargain for a visit\n\nSimply rip it once again\n\nDa Vinci with the pen\n\nTrying to reach beyond stars\n\nLiving life behind bars\n\nI know that life‘s a miracle, but it can leave you miserable\n\nAnd if you’re in my position then you probably feel invisible\n\nBut trust me we’re invincible\n\nThe music makes us visible\n\nGive them something to listen to\n\nAnd always stick to your principles yo\n\n\n\nThis is the awakening\n\nNo more complacency, I’m done\n\nWe gotta break from the safety\n\nCause my mistakes are what made me\n\nYou can say that I’m crazy but know that You won’t break me\n\n\n\nWe’re moshing through these obstacles\n\nSquashing everything possible\n\nBlocking just isn’t logical\n\nCan’t stop the unstoppable\n\nNo question who’s blessing these bars\n\nExpectantly reppin my squad, we don’t get angry we get even\n\nYou’ll get wrecked if you step to me odd\n\nWAKE UP\n\nWAKE UP\n\nNo more time for waiting\n\nGET UP\n\nGET UP\n\nFor the Evaluation\n\nWAKE UP\n\nWAKE UP\n\nNo more time for caution\n\nGET UP\n\nGET UP\n\nAnd Failure is not an option\n\n\n\nThis is the awakening\n\nNo more complacency, I’m done\n\nWe gotta break from the safety\n\nCause my mistakes are what made me\n\nYou can say that I’m crazy but know that You won’t break me",
