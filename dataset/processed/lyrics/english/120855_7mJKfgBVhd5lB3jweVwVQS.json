(Hey)\n\n[Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]\nSo can, can you forgive me friend?\nCan you forgive me friend for breaking us apart?\n'Cause in the end, I didn't want this to end\nCan you forgive me friend? Forgive my ugly heart\n\n[Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]\n\nAnd I guess that we don't need to be falling apart\nBut you will always have a special place in my heart\nI never wanted this to end, can you forgive me friend?\n\n[Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]\n'Cause I fell in the hole, in the hole, in the hole\nMy heart was turning cold, turning cold, turning cold\nI never wanted this to end, can you forgive me friend? (Hey)",
