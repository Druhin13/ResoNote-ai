What you even dream?)\n\n\n\nI had a vision\n\nA room full of women\n\nAll of them were driven\n\nStraight independent\n\n\n\nShe got a square frame, but she deemed a legend\n\nHip-Hop claim she like an eleven\n\nTake all my thoughts and my ideas\n\nWall so thick call her Ikea\n\nSo lit when I plug in\n\nSo in sync, in sync when I'm loving\n\nKnock and rock call her Ali-Ah, call her Ali-Ah\n\nKnock and rock call her Ali-Ah\n\nRock this Bo- shh shh, shut up, you can't clear that sample\n\nBring the chorus\n\n\n\nI had a vision\n\nA room full of women\n\nAll of them were driven\n\nStraight independent\n\n\n\nTouching you is so easy\n\nSwear it's muscle-muscle-muscle-muscle memory\n\nMix chick, and she's black, white, enchanting\n\nLady lady won't you come with me\n\n\n\nHit hard, hit south (velocity)\n\nTurn left, turn right (knobby Knees)\n\nGo up, go down (variety)\n\nSame time, same time (melody)\n\n\n\nHit hard, hit south (velocity)\n\nTurn left, turn right (knobby Knees)\n\nGo up, go down (variety)\n\nSame time, same time (melody)\n\n\n\nHit hard, hit south (velocity)\n\nTurn left, turn right (knobby Knees)\n\nGo up, go down (variety)\n\nSame time, same time (melody)",
