  "lyrics": "I had my first crush in season two\r\nShe'd pass me notes and feel our hands with glue\r\nAnd in my quarteroids we'd walk to school\r\nI sat and crossed my legs like Jim would do\r\nShe moved away, I was on season three\r\nIt hit my heart so hard I'd hardly speak\n\nBut I could find some peace and privacy\n\nA paper company to sit with me\n\n\n\nWho are we to wonder where we're going?\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\nLet's take it back and take in every moment\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\n\n\nI turned down Jamerson when I was twelve\n\nI spent that Friday night with Steve Carell\n\nThe one where Dwight became the head of sales\n\nMy eighth grade graduation wished me well\n\nI lost my grandpa during season six\n\nI watched my mom, she cried and held her kids\n\nMy mom was broken up, I couldn't think\n\nSo I just hugged her the way Michael did\n\n\n\nNow, who are we to wonder where we're going?\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\nLet's take it back and take in every moment\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\n\n\nWonder where we're going\n\nTell me who I am\n\nTake in every moment\n\nHold it close again\n\n\n\nNow the finale's done and I'm alone\n\nI'm on a Netflix trip here on my phone\n\nBut who I am is in these episodes\n\nSo don't you tell me that it's just a show.\n\n\n\nWho are we to wonder where we're going?\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\nLet's take it back and take in every moment\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\n\n\nOh, Who are we to wonder where we're going?\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\nLet's take it back and take in every moment\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\n\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?\n\nWho am I to tell me who I am?",
