  "lyrics": "I was ok on my own then I saw you\r\nYou were standing all alone and I watched you\r\nWe were both looking for something, someone to talk to\r\nThere's something about you, you do whatever you want to\r\nMake up on my pillow case\n\nWake up with your after taste\n\nOur bodies burning up in flames\n\nBut all you do is slip away\n\n\n\nSo I hold you like fire even though it hurts\n\nSo I hold you like fire even though I might get burned\n\nSo I hold you like fire\n\nAnd I pray this time I learn to let you go\n\nBut I don't know, I don't know why\n\n(Hold you like, hold you like fire)\n\n(So I hold you like fire)\n\n\n\nGot you close and you hide that you like it\n\nWhen you're all over me my skins ignited\n\nSo breathe 'cause it's just me\n\nThere's no pressure, let's just be\n\nBut every time this feels like there's something\n\nThen it's morning and you leave\n\n\n\nMake up on my pillow case\n\nWake up with your after taste\n\nOur bodies burning up in flames\n\nBut all you do is slip away\n\n\n\nSo I hold you like fire even though it hurts\n\nSo I hold you like fire even though I might get burned\n\nSo I hold you like fire\n\nAnd I pray this time I learn to let you go\n\nBut I don't know, I don't know why\n\n(Hold you like, hold you like fire)\n\n(So I hold you like fire)\n\n\n\nAlways stays the same\n\nSetting fire to the brain\n\nHit me like a hurricane\n\nStill I try to grab the flame\n\nAnd I get burned\n\nEvery time you leave it's like I never learn\n\nI just keep playing with fire till I get what I deserve\n\n\n\nWith your make up on my pillow case\n\nWake up with your after taste\n\nOur bodies burning up in flames\n\nBut all you do is slip away\n\n\n\nSo I hold you like fire even though it hurts\n\nSo I hold you like fire even though I might get burned\n\nSo I hold you like fire\n\nAnd I pray this time I learn to let you go\n\nBut I don't know, I don't know why\n\n(Hold you like, hold you like fire)\n\n(So I hold you like fire)",
