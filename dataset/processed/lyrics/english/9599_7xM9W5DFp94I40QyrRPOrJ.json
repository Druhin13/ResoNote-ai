  "lyrics": "Jenny and Jill were sweethearts in the heartland\r\nPure and plain like the voice of Judy Garland\r\nTook a year of selling bicycles to buy tickets for the festival\r\nThat Jenny gave Jill before she moved away\r\nAnd there's a whole lot of people out there who never give loving\n\nJenny and Jill were lucky in love and best friends\n\nThey talk about things they do and the songs they wanna slow dance to\n\nAs they drove on through the amber waves of grain\n\n\n\nAnd Jenny said: \"I don't ever want to forget\n\n\"How lucky I feel to be in the same place: You and I\"\n\n\n\nFor everything you do there is a first time\n\nAnd you never forget the first time, the first time\n\nDon't forget to be here before you move on\n\n'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time\n\n\n\nThey camped out in a field of fellow pilgrims\n\nIn a tent city of mother nature's children\n\nThere were hippy kids and [?], sorority girls on their shoulders\n\nThere'd be other bands and shows, but never this one\n\n\n\nAnd Jenny said: \"I don't ever want to forget\n\n\"How lucky I feel to be in the same place: You and I\"\n\n\n\nFor everything you do there is a first time\n\nAnd you never forget the first time, the first time\n\nDon't forget to be here before you move on\n\n'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time\n\nThe very first time!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Jenny said: \"I don't ever want to forget\n\n\"How lucky I feel to be in the same place: You and I\n\n\"This is our time, this is our life\"\n\n\n\nFor everything you do there is a first time\n\nAnd you never forget the first time, the first time\n\nDon't forget to be here before you move on\n\n'Cause you never forget the first time, the first time\n\nThe very first time!",
