  "lyrics": "Night and day, you are the one\r\nOnly you beneath the moon\r\nUnder the sun\r\nWhether near to me or far\r\nIt's no matter, where you are\n\nI think of you night and day\n\n\n\nNight and day, why's it so\n\nThat this longing for you\n\nFollows wherever I go\n\n\n\nIn the roaring traffic's boom\n\nIn the silence of my lonely room\n\nI think of you day and night\n\n\n\nNight and day, under the hide of me\n\nThere's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning\n\nBurning inside of me\n\nAnd this torment won't be through\n\nTill you let me spend my life making love to you\n\nDay and night, night and day\n\n\n\nNight and day, under the hide of me\n\nThere's an, ooh, such a hungry yearning\n\nBurning inside of me\n\nAnd this torment won't be through\n\nTill you let me spend my life making love to you\n\nDay and night, night and day\n\n\n\nNight and day",
