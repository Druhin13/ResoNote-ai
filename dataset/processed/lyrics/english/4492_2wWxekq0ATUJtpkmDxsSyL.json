  "lyrics": "Weirdness follows me wherever I go\r\nWeirdness seems to know me even better than I seem to know myself\r\nI'm someone else\r\nLooking to the clock beside my bed\r\nAm I really keeping time or is it only keeping me instead?\r\nGo back to bed\n\n\n\nWoah woah woah woah\n\nYou've got time to grow\n\nOh soldier, take your time\n\nNo one said the words all have to rhyme, and if they do it's fine\n\nAnd even if they don't, no one needs to know\n\nWoah woah soldier, you gotta let things go\n\n\n\nAnd our hand moves faster with the scotch\n\nEven when you're really moving faster every minute if you watch\n\nAnd I drink a lot\n\nBut drinking only wakes you up at ten\n\nSpend the day regretting, but I'm betting that you'll do it all again\n\nNext weekend\n\n\n\nWoah woah woah woah\n\nYou've got time to grow\n\nOh soldier, take your time\n\nNo one said the words all have to rhyme, and if they do it's fine\n\nAnd even if they don't, no one needs to know\n\nWoah woah soldier, you gotta let things go\n\n\n\nDon't look down the barrel with an arrow in the bow\n\nDressed down in apparel with camouflage from head to toe\n\nWith everything so sterile in a heavy monotone\n\nOh soldier, you gotta let things go\n\n\n\nOh soldier, take your time\n\nNo one said the words all have to rhyme, and if they do it's fine\n\nAnd even if they don't, no one needs to know\n\nWoah woah soldier, you gotta let things go",
