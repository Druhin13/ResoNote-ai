  "lyrics": "When he calls you\r\nYou don't have to answer right away\r\nMake him wait\r\nAnd when he small talks\r\nBefore he asks you on a date\r\nMake him wait\n\nWhen his Pontiac's in the driveway\n\nAnd his eyes are midnight blue\n\nTake a deep breath\n\nDo the opposite of what you wanna do\n\n\n\nMake him wait\n\nBy the phone\n\nAt the door to meet your dad\n\nBefore that first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand\n\nYou can't get it back when you give yourself away\n\nYeah a boy's gonna run but a real man's gonna stay\n\nGirl, make him wait\n\nMake him wait\n\n\n\nAnd when he says that\n\nIt'd be easier if you just stay the night\n\nMake him wait\n\nYou're gonna wanna\n\nAnd you're thinking you just might\n\nBut make him wait\n\n\n\nMake him wait\n\nBy the phone\n\nAt the door to meet your dad\n\nBefore that first kiss, he's gotta hold your hand\n\nYou can't get it back when you give yourself away\n\nYeah a boy's gonna run but a real man's gonna stay\n\nGirl, make him wait\n\nMake him wait\n\n\n\nThey taught me love is worth the weight in gold\n\nLike that ring on your hand\n\nSo when you find the one\n\nThe staying kind\n\nThen he won't mind\n\n\n\nIf you make him wait\n\nIn his tux\n\nCello sings you down the aisle\n\nWalk slow, take your time\n\nWhile your daddy cries and your momma smiles\n\nWhen they're throwing rice into the air\n\nAnd those tin cans roll away\n\nAnd you look into his eyes\n\nAnd realize it was worth the while\n\nTo make him wait\n\nMake him wait",
