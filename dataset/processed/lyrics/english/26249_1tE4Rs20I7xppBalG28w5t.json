  "lyrics": "My old school has closed its doors\r\nThe once green fields are now concrete floors\r\nAnd the roads are choking, full of misery and fear\r\nBut my vision's getting clearer and my mind it feels so free\r\nAnd the work is hard and the wages are low\r\nBut the smiles still appear and the rivers still flow\n\nAnd all I can do is sit here and moan\n\nBut my heart still bleeds for this place that I call home\n\nMy boyhood made of dreams of love\n\nThe happiest of times sitting with my mum and dad\n\nBut the bridges, the houses now dominate\n\nThe vaping and the super schools, the breeding grounds of hate\n\nBut those once green fields still live in my mind\n\nThey seemed so perfect so simple and so kind\n\nJust me and my brother were kicking a ball\n\nThe world so close and so beautiful\n\nAnd I got no answers, I place no blame\n\nI just feel longing and I wanna hear you name\n\nAs I walk and I run through these once green fields\n\nIt's easy to see what has disappeared\n\nAnd the air is getting heavy with memory and loss\n\nThe joy and the freedom, but freedom at what cost?\n\nAnd the air is getting heavy with memory and loss\n\nThe joy and the freedom, but freedom at what cost?\n\nIs this your inheritance? Is this all that's left?\n\nThe mountains we climbed are now mountains of debt\n\nAnd the air is getting heavy with memory and loss\n\nThe joy and the freedom, but freedom at what cost?\n\nWe had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun\n\nYeah, we had joy, we had fun, we had some seasons in the sun\n\nYeah, we had joy, we had fun, we had some seasons in the sun\n\nYeah, we had joy, we had fun, we had some seasons in the sun",
