  "lyrics": "The first impression did a million things\r\nIt felt so good for a couple of weeks\r\nIt was so clear, oh decided in days\r\nBut all things go, isn't that the way?\r\nSay so, say that you won't go\n\nSay so, say that you won't go\n\nSay so, say that you won't go\n\n\n\nWhy don't I feel alone sometimes\n\nWhen I just wanna make you feel?\n\nI see every conversation and I know that it was real\n\nYou're in the clear, you're leaving here\n\nYou feel so far, you feel so near\n\n\n\nA pair of shoes living under my bed\n\nWe've come so far, isn't that what they say?\n\nThe year, a year, what is time among friends?\n\nBut you must go, isn't that the end?\n\n\n\nSay so, say that you won't go\n\nSay so, say that you won't go\n\nSay so, say that you won't go\n\n\n\nWhy don't I feel alone sometimes\n\nWhen I just wanna make you feel?\n\nI see every conversation and I know that it was real\n\nYou're in the clear, you're leaving here\n\nI still wait up for your call if you're not here\n\n\n\nPeople and try and people die\n\nPeople work all of their lives\n\nYou had dreams, so it seems\n\nAnd I would do a million things\n\n\n\nPeople and try and people die\n\nPeople work all of their lives\n\nYou had dreams, so it seems\n\nAnd I would do a million things\n\n\n\nPeople and try and people die\n\nPeople work all of their lives\n\nYou had dreams, so it seems\n\nAnd I would do a million things",
