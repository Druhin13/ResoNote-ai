  "lyrics": "Selfish dream, self-esteem, self-destruction off the beams\r\nHelpless beings sowing seeds to assert the solar fiends\r\nThough it seems shit ain't panning out but it's on the screen\r\nKnow that means we are being deemed as a comedy\r\nThis is me, fuck you mean, living like I'm in a dream\n\nVisualize it unity, divide it far as you can see\n\nDiamonds bling while they bleed, fighting for our future seeds\n\nFigure where you wanna be, choose a side and take the streets\n\n\n\nI said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say\n\nMissing some screws above, don't feel okay today\n\nI pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away\n\nTruly I do me well, it may not seem that way\n\nI said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say\n\nMissing some screws above, don't feel okay today\n\nI pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away\n\nTruly I do me well, it may not seem that way\n\n\n\nIs Archimedes mucho and greedy? It's what I'm pleadin', yes\n\nMischievous the true elite convenient, placing books where your TV is\n\nAlleged genius proceed to flee with hits\n\nI'm leaving this, a form of preemie fetus kid, I'm devious\n\n\n\nProcessed by the media, this ain't no Wikipedia\n\nFoods lacking substance and people change for the greedier\n\nSelfish and feeble weak minds blinded by ego and pride\n\nHope we can see with three eyes because we need to see why\n\n\n\nI said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say\n\nMissing some screws above, don't feel okay today\n\nI pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away\n\nTruly I do me well, it may not seem that way\n\nI said misunderstood, I ain't afraid to say\n\nMissing some screws above, don't feel okay today\n\nI pour some liquor out, I mix the pain away\n\nTruly I do me well, it may not seem that way",
