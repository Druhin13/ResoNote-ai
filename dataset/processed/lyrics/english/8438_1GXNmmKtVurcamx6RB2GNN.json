  "lyrics": "Drowing in a ocean of you\r\nForty foot waves\r\nWhispering sweet nothings in your bed\r\nCould stay here for days\r\nGave you all of me, I'II never leave\n\nWays that we could stay between the sheets\n\nOh, but they can't see what you do to me\n\nDoesn't really matter what they say\n\n\n\nAnd they think you don't give enough\n\nBut I do, I do..\n\nThey say I don't really need your love\n\nBut I do, I do... I DO\n\n\n\nOpen ticket to nowhere\n\nis how we spend our days\n\nChasing that silver lining hiding far away\n\nI never wanted to change\n\n\n\nGave you all of me, I'II never leave\n\nWays that we could stay between the sheets\n\nOh, but they can't see what you do to me\n\nDoesn't really matter what they say\n\n\n\nAnd they think you don't give enough\n\nBut I do, I do..\n\nThey say I don't really need your love\n\nBut I do, I do... I DO",
