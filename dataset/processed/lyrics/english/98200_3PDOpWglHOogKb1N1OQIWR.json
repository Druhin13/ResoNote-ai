  "lyrics": "Every I time I see the sunshine, oh yeah\r\nWhen I was a young man, thought I was a genius\r\nThought everything I thought was a gift, couldn't be taught\r\nNow I know I was just arrogant\r\nWhen I was a young man, thought I could do anything\n\nThought I could go to space, thought I could be police\n\nThought I could be the president\n\nWell maybe it was bad luck, maybe there was bad drugs\n\nBut I came reticent\n\nI was sticking out my chest but lacking that finesse\n\nLacking that experience, aw yeah\n\n\n\nThough I know I'm going blind, I can't stop staring at the sun\n\nThe only paradise is find is the barrel of a gun\n\n(Make the sun shine)\n\n\n\nThe only way the sun is gonna shine\n\n\n\nNobody's gonna save me, nobody 'cept for me, yeah\n\nNobody's gonna hand me a check for fifty grand and pull me from the deep end\n\nI might be goin' crazy, this room is going wavy\n\nBut I'll be searchin' through my mind for that peace I left behind\n\n'Til I'm pushin' up the daisies\n\nAt least I got my shadow, yeah\n\nShepherd to the promise land\n\nGive me sanctuary\n\nWhere still waters carry my soul away from flooding rains\n\nOh, it's bound to break a levee, oh now\n\n\n\nTake back all your borrowed time, I think I finally had my fun\n\nThe only paradise I've yet to find is the barrel of a gun\n\nThe only high that's worth my time is the barrel of a gun\n\nThe only way the sun is gonna shine is through the barrel of a gun\n\n\n\nLeast I got my shadow, yeah\n\nThe only way the sun is gonna shine\n\nTake back all your borrowed time\n\nThe only high that's worth my time\n\nGive me sanctuary\n\nI can't stop staring at the sun",
