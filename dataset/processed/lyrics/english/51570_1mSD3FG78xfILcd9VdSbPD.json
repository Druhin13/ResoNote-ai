  "lyrics": "Sail on your mistakes\r\nThis world has yet to make a soldier of me\r\nI'm losing faith, I'm losing pride\r\nI'm filled with vengeance, I've chosen my side\r\nIt's not enough to be a casualty\n\nI'll never bow to this insanity\n\nScreaming set me free\n\nDig our heels into the face of supposed democracy\n\n\n\nBehold\n\nThe absent the king has shown his hand to us\n\nArise\n\n\n\nWe fell into the waves that carried this tragedy\n\nSomewhere along the way the skies turned grey\n\nResist and stand united\n\nThrough grief and dismay\n\nThis kingdom left divided\n\nWitness the state decay\n\n\n\nBring them to trail to hang in the square\n\nA constant reminder of the hatred we share\n\n\n\nIt's not enough to send the help they need\n\nThey'll never bow to this insanity\n\nScreaming to set them free\n\nDig your heels into the face of supposed democracy\n\n\n\nBehold\n\nThe absent the king has shown his hand to us\n\nArise\n\n\n\nWe fell into the waves that carried this tragedy\n\nSomewhere along the way the skies turned grey\n\nResist and stand united\n\nThrough grief and dismay\n\nThis kingdom left divided\n\nWitness the state decay\n\n\n\nLight the sculpture up, we paid in pain\n\nNo prison cell can hold us, in pain we gain\n\nLight the sculpture up in flames\n\nHammers fall to break these chains\n\nThe state decays\n\nFor it's nothing without us\n\n\n\nAnd as we lay the fallen to rest in the ground\n\nTheir families remember that peace can not be found\n\nWith pain, we paid\n\n\n\nWitness the state decay",
