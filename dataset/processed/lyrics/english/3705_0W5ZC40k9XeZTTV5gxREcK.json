  "lyrics": "You could raise the dead\r\nWith those terribly troublesome eyes\r\nMaybe you’ll always be bad\r\nMaybe you’ll always be the same\r\nAre you alone, locked inside\n\nThat prison in your head?\n\nYou walk through the crowd\n\nLost in the sound\n\nInvisible to every passing eye\n\n\n\nThis waking life is not what it seems to be\n\nNo time to talk, no air to breathe\n\nReminisce the scent of a single flower\n\nWhat butchers cleave, the wolves devour\n\nBut if you consume it you will surely die\n\nWhen you’re buried with your tenderness\n\nYou’ll drag it to your solitary grave\n\n\n\nAre you alone, locked inside\n\nThe prison of your mind?\n\nYou walk through the crowd\n\nLost in the sound\n\nInvisible to every passing eye\n\nInvisible to every passing eye",
