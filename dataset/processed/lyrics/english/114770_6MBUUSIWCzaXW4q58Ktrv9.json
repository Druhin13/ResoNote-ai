  "lyrics": "Lights go down, wheels go around\r\nI'm taking you home\r\nHoping for a slow song to come on the radio now\r\nI'm not ready to shut it down\r\nThe way the dashboard glow\r\nIs hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind\n\nAnd the only thing I wanna do is find a spot\n\nStop this car and throw it in park and get just\n\n\n\nSlow dance with you\n\nSpinning you around by the Walmart sign\n\nAnd moving our feet over the painted white lines\n\nGetting close to you\n\nMaking the most of whatever we got\n\nEven if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot\n\nSlow dance in a parking lot\n\n\n\nHalf song gone, one door open, across the lot\n\nA rent-a-cop's rolling a security car\n\nAnd its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time\n\nTo the radio singing\n\nA little Garth Brooks\n\nYou start humming the very last verse to \"She's Every Woman\"\n\nAnd I don't care what song comes next\n\nI'm falling right here, don't wanna safety net in a\n\n\n\nSlow dance with you\n\nSpinning you around by the Walmart sign\n\nAnd moving our feet over the painted white lines\n\nGetting close to you\n\nMaking the most of whatever we got\n\nEven if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot\n\n\n\nAnd get close to you\n\nMaking the most of whatever we got, even if its just\n\n\n\nA slow dance with you\n\nSpinning you around by the Walmart sign\n\nAnd moving our feet over the painted white lines\n\nGetting close to you\n\nMaking the most of whatever we got\n\nEven if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot",
