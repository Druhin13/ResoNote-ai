  "lyrics": "The sweat soaks his shirt\r\nand he's feeling his blood thin out\r\nand thie pulse we've built outside this epidermis keeps his charm en route\r\npedals to the floor\r\nlike my hips press to yours\n\nthere's a whisper from your lips \"lets go\"\n\nyou don't stand a chance\n\n\n\ni'm as stealthy as a slow gas leak\n\nby the time that you know you'll have succomb to me\n\ni've never seen such a battle to open one door\n\n\n\nyou're batting eyes\n\nas he's taking his time\n\nas we're playing out the last notes to your culling song\n\n\n\npedals to the floor\n\nlike my hips press to yours\n\nthere's a whisper from your lips \"lets go\"\n\nyou don't stand a chance\n\n\n\nI'm a rush much like passing notes\n\ncos i'm keeping the secrets you'd all die to know\n\nbut have no shame\n\nthese boundaries called waistlines are bound to be broken sometime",
