  "lyrics": "We crossed our hearts and never hoped to lie\r\nFor the ghosts along The Castro were just walking by\r\nWe went back to scratch and had to start again\r\nLike a ring of roses everyone was falling down\r\nWe made a miracle\n\nWe had to come up with a cunning plan\n\nA time for quiet contemplation\n\nDying on the steps of City Hall\n\n\n\nThey turned on love and turned their backs\n\nAnd left us to a sheer attack\n\nAnd I'm not really pleased with that\n\nAnd still it's not over\n\nThe universe is big enough\n\nAnd there's room for the two of us\n\nAnd ignorance it isn't bliss\n\nAnd words they can't hurt me\n\n\n\nThey held us all in very low esteem\n\nWe had to fight for our right, had to steal the scene\n\nIt felt so right to see the rebels run\n\nBecause we know that something good was being done\n\n\n\nBut you never gave a damn\n\nWe had to come up with a cunning plan\n\nWe were fighting for survival\n\nWe had to look the Devil in the eye\n\n\n\nThey turned on love and turned their backs\n\nAnd left us to a sheer attack\n\nAnd I'm not really pleased with that\n\nAnd still it's not over\n\nThe universe is big enough\n\nAnd there's room for the two of us\n\nAnd ignorance it isn't bliss\n\nAnd words they can't hurt me\n\n\n\nThey turned on love and turned their backs\n\nAnd left us to a sheer attack\n\nAnd I'm not really pleased with that\n\nAnd still it's not over\n\n\n\n(And still it's not over)\n\n\n\nWe made a miracle\n\nDying on the steps of City Hall\n\n\n\nThey turned on love and turned their backs\n\nAnd left us to a sheer attack\n\nAnd I'm not really pleased with that\n\nAnd still it's not over\n\nThe universe is big enough\n\nAnd there's room for the two of us\n\nAnd ignorance it isn't bliss\n\nAnd words they can't hurt me\n\n\n\nThey turned on love and turned their backs\n\nAnd left us to a sheer attack\n\nAnd I'm not really pleased with that\n\nAnd still it's not over\n\nThe universe is big enough\n\nAnd there's room for the two of us\n\nAnd ignorance it isn't bliss\n\nAnd words they can't hurt me",
