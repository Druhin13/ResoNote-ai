  "lyrics": "Yesterday, I turned twenty-three\r\nThe date didn't mean that much to me\r\nThen I started adding figures up in my head\r\nIt seems the cost of dreaming's left me in the red\r\nBecause of alcohol\n\nI've shared sixteen beds\n\nThere's a five year reunion\n\nHanging over my head\n\n\n\nAt least eleven thousand people\n\nThink I'm somethin' I'm not\n\nAnd the courage to let them down\n\nIsn't something I've still got\n\n\n\nSometimes I wanna cheat, but I don't\n\nI wanna quit, but I won't...cause I made this bed...\n\n(Give me a shovel, you'll be amazed\n\nAt how fast I dig a grave, baby, just to lay in it)\n\n\n\nYou're only brave 'til you're scared...\n\nYou're only unique until compared...\n\nTo every other worthless fuck tryin' to\n\n(Crawl into bed tonight...)\n\n\n\nYou can't afford to live like...this...\n\n(Yes, we can! Yes, we can!)\n\nYou can't be dumb enough to dream so...big...\n\n(Yes, we can! Yes, we can!)\n\n\n\nYeah, we'll sail through the sleazy seas\n\nPast all the casting couches, rug-burned knees\n\nNo, I'm not done yet...\n\nNo-no, I'm only getting started...\n\n\n\nYou can't afford to live like this\n\nYou can't be dumb enough to dream so big\n\n\n\nYeah, we'll sail through the sleazy seas\n\nPast all the casting couches, rug-burned knees\n\nNo, I'm not done yet...\n\n\n\nYou can't afford to live like...this...\n\n(Yes, we can! Yes, we can!)\n\nYou can't be dumb enough to dream so...big...\n\n(Yes, we can! Yes, we can!)\n\n\n\nYeah, we'll sail through the sleazy seas\n\nPast all the casting couches, rug-burned knees\n\nNo, I'm not done yet...\n\nNo-no, I'm only getting started...\n\n\n\n(Thanks to Maddy for these lyrics)",
