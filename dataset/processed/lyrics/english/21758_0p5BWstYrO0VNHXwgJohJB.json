  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Best of It par Whyte Horses\r\nI don’t need nobody girl\nTo treat me like you do\nIt would be so much better girl\nTo live a life without you\n\nBut I guess I’ll make the best of it\nDon’t know how to say goodbye\nI guess I’ll keep the best of it\nThe rest of it can ride\n\nOh you caused me so much trouble\nThat I think I’m gonna break\nBut the worst of all my troubles\nIs you know how much I can take\n\nAfter all you disappointments girl\n\nDon’t know what I’m gonna do\nThere’s a lot of love inside me girl\nAnd I want to give it to you\n\nBut I guess I’ll make the best of it\nEven though you treat me bad\nI keep watching for the rest of it\nAnd realise that I’ve been had\n\nOh you caused me so much trouble\nTrouble with myself inside\nOh you caused me so much pain\nI’d like to catch a train and ride\nAll the times that I have known you girl\nI’ve realised that you are you\nI’ll either keep you or forget you girl\nThere’s nothing else I can do\nThere’s nothing else I can do to help you",
