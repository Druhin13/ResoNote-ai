  "lyrics": "I've only seen a love full of conditions\r\nHiding with the fear that it can break\r\nI've searched the world to get a taste of heaven\r\nBut all along it was heaven chasing me\r\nYour love is the real thing it's a real thing\n\nIt's the air I breathe\n\nYour love it's got a hold on me and it's holding me\n\nIt is everything it's the real thing\n\n\n\nYour grace is more than just an obligation\n\nYou give without a promise of return\n\nYour mercy looks beyond my reputation\n\nFor I belong in heaven's destiny\n\nFor I belong in heaven's destiny\n\n\n\nYour love is the real thing it's a real thing\n\nIt's the air I breathe\n\nYour love it's got a hold on me and it's holding me\n\nIt is everything it's the real thing\n\n\n\nI can't outrun it, I can't explain it, I don't deserve it\n\nJesus, Your love for me\n\nIt's not complacent, it's always chasing, it won't abandon\n\nJesus, Your love for me\n\nNot disappointing, won't leave me wanting, its overwhelming\n\nJesus, Your love for me\n\nI know I need it, I know its worth it, the cross, it proves it\n\nJesus, Your love for me\n\n\n\nYour love is the real thing it's a real thing\n\nIt's the air I breathe\n\nYour love it's got a hold on me and it's holding me\n\nIt is everything it's the real thing\n\nYour love is the real thing it's a real thing\n\nIt's the air I breathe\n\nYour love it's got a hold on me and it's holding me\n\nIt is everything it's the real thing\n\n\n\nThere's a place for me and it's heavenly at the table with\n\nThe King\n\nIt's the real thing",
