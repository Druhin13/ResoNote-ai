  "lyrics": "My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect\r\nBut I work hard, so I deserve it\r\nAnd I belong, right where you see me\r\nAin't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny\r\nNah, I got a decent set of manners\r\nAnd a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner\n\nAnd I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour\n\nWho dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana\n\nSo often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it\n\nBut truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it\n\nYou could show up at the party on dirty public transit\n\nAnd I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids\n\nOf you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed\n\nWith your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed\n\nI don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'\n\nBut these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'\n\n\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\n\n\nAhem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect\n\nAnd I work harder than hard workin'\n\nBizarre circus, that's when my bars surface\n\nTherefore I act a clown\n\nEven when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down\n\nSo over-stand me\n\nI got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy\n\nAnd I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy\n\nAnd I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana\n\nAnd when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'\n\nAnd I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick\n\nYour girl singin' to my shit, like, \"a-la-la-lollipop\"\n\nShe say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop\n\nAnd she say I freak that pussy better\n\nBetter than her gynecologist, ho just\n\nText me whenever you want some more dick\n\nMore dick, old bitch, young bitch\n\nBut I be like damn, all I got is one dick\n\n\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\n\n\nI got the talk, the beat and bass\n\nGive me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place\n\nTell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace\n\nI break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race\n\n\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nI got to be unstoppable\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\nAy-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie\n\n\n\nYo what up? It's Chris Paul, CP3, feel my man Drake, So Far Gone, Drake, I gotchu homie, I gotchu. Let's get 'em",
