  "lyrics": "There comes a time in a young man's life\r\nHe should settle down and find himself a wife\r\nBut I'm just fine because I know that you are mine\r\nI fight crime online sometimes\r\nThen write rhymes I hide behind\n\nMy switch, her wine, both crying\n\nI'm fine if you are fine\n\n\n\nLooking back on 2009\n\nPeople said that it was raining all the time\n\nI see sunshine because I know that you were mine\n\n\n\nYou say that I'm wasting your time\n\nI smile and tell you things will be fine\n\nFor some reason, I just can't say I do\n\n\n\nThere comes a time in a young man's life\n\nHe should settle down and find himself a wife\n\nBut I'm just fine because I know that you are mine",
