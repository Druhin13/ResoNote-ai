  "lyrics": "There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved\r\nNever I'd had life enough\r\nMy heart is screaming out\r\nAnd in a few days I would be there, love\r\nEver here that's lived in me is yours just as it was\n\nJust as it was, baby\n\nBefore the otherness came\n\nAnd I knew its name\n\nThe love, the dark, the light, the flame\n\n\n\nEyes at the hights of my baby\n\nLet's hope at the fight of my baby\n\nThe lights were as bright as my baby\n\nBut your love was unmoved\n\n\n\nAnd tell me if somehow some of it remained\n\nHow long you would wait for me?\n\nHow long I'd been away?\n\nThe shape that I'm in now is shaping the doorway\n\nMake your good love known to me\n\nJust tell me about your day\n\n\n\nJust as it was, baby\n\nBefore the otherness came\n\nAnd I knew its name\n\nThe love, the dark, the light, the shame\n\n\n\nEyes at the hights of my babe\n\nAnd this hope at the fight of my babe\n\nAnd the lights were as bright as my babe\n\nBut you love was unmoved\n\n\n\nAnd the sights were as stark as my baby\n\nAnd the cold was as sharp as my baby\n\nAnd the nights were as dark as my baby\n\nHalf as beautiful too",
