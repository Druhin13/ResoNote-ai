  "lyrics": "(We'll understand it all by and by)\r\nTempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder\r\nWhy it should be thus all the day long\r\nWhile there are others living about us\r\nNever molested, though in the wrong\n\nFarther along we'll know more about it\n\nFarther along we'll understand why\n\nCheer up my brother live in the sunshine\n\nWe'll understand it all by and by\n\n\n\nWhen death has come and taken our loved ones\n\nLeaving our homes so lonely and drear\n\nThen do we wonder how others prosper\n\nLiving so wicked year after year\n\n\n\nFarther along we'll know more about it\n\nFarther along we'll understand why\n\nCheer up my brother live in the sunshine\n\nWe'll understand it all by and by",
