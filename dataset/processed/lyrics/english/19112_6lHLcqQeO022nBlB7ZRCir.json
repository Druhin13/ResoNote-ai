  "lyrics": "It was the year 2000 when I first sipped lean\r\nMy homie from D-town put me on the scene\r\nThis was way back, before it was a big thing\r\nBefore every rapper was a fucking dope fiend\r\nMy little brother went to PV, he put me up on that DJ Screw n' Pimp C\r\nHe was still free at the time, I was on tour with the legends tryna shine\n\nI hit the club, looking for the plug\n\nI was down deep in [?] tryna find this new drug\n\nMet this dude, said he's from the northside\n\nSaid he knew a spot and he would give me a ride\n\nDidn't think twice, he said that he was a fan\n\nAnd I would do anything to get up out the van\n\nFifteen seater we was rolling ten deep\n\nAnd I was sittin' bitch so I couldn't get sleep\n\nI heard codeine was the thing to make you pass out\n\nGot to the spot, he told me pull the cash out\n\nI asked how much, he told me forty bucks\n\nHe came back with a baby food jar (what the fuck)\n\nHe said it was a deuce, I mixed it with the soda or I mix it with some juice\n\nHe just laughed and he told me be patient\n\n[?] the corner, we was at the gas station\n\nGot some ice in a [?] cup\n\nA can of orange soda, it was time to grow up\n\nI started sippin', headed back to the show\n\n'Bout the time I hit the stage, everything was movin' slow\n\nThe front row was lit, the show was super thick\n\nI walked straight to the edge of the stage and then I slipped\n\nThe rest of the show went on without a hitch\n\nWhen it was over, I was sober, I was looking for a chick\n\nWalking through the crowd, hey yo where is at?\n\nStaring at this chick, she started staring at me back\n\nBefore I got the chance to go and start flirting\n\nThis bitch nigga stepped on my Jordan thirteens\n\nI kept them on ice, since 1998\n\nJust looked down and chuckled, then he laughed to my face\n\nLaughed because I fell off the stage, he had jokes\n\nSo I knocked his ass out in front of all of his folks\n\nFucked around, out of town, and I couldn't got smoke\n\nBut sometimes it's like \"fuck it\", you gotta go for broke\n\nOne of his homies stepped up and got knocked out clean\n\nWhile the dude who took me earlier to go and get the lean\n\nDidn't make a scene\n\nWe pushed it to the car\n\nThen headed to the spot, and we copped another\n\nThis time we bought a pipe, 'cause I owed them that\n\nWhen people show you love, you always show it back",
