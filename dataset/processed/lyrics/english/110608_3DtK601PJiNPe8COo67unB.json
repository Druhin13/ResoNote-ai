  "lyrics": "Just a small town girl\r\nLivin' in a lonely world\r\nShe took the midnight train\r\nGoin' anywhere\r\nJust a city boy\r\nBorn and raised in South Detroit\n\nHe took the midnight train\n\nGoin' anywhere\n\n\n\nA singer in a smokey room\n\nA smell of wine and cheap perfume\n\nFor a smile they can share the night\n\nIt goes on and on and on and on\n\n\n\nStrangers waiting\n\nUp and down the boulevard\n\nTheir shadows searching\n\nIn the night\n\nStreetlights, people\n\nLivin' just to find emotion\n\nHidin', somewhere in the night\n\n\n\nWorkin' hard to get my fill\n\nEverybody wants a thrill\n\nPayin' anything to roll the dice\n\nJust one more time\n\nSome will win\n\nSome will lose\n\nSome were born to sing the blues\n\nOh, the movie never ends\n\nIt goes on and on and on and on\n\n\n\nStrangers waiting\n\nUp and down the boulevard\n\nTheir shadows searching\n\nIn the night\n\nStreetlights, people\n\nLivin' just to find emotion\n\nHidin', somewhere in the night\n\n\n\n[Instrumental Interlude]\n\n\n\nDon't stop believin'\n\nHold on to the feelin'\n\nStreetlights, people\n\nDon't stop believin'\n\nHold on\n\nStreetlights, people",
