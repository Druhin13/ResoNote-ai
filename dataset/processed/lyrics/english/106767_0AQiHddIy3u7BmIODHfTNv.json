  "lyrics": "I'm a white man living in a white man's world\r\nUnder our roof is a baby girl\r\nI thought this world could be her's one day\r\nBut her momma knew better\r\nI'm a white man living in a white man's town\n\nWant to take a shot of cocaine and burn it down\n\nMomma wants to change that Nashville sound\n\nBut they're never gonna let her\n\n\n\nThere's no such thing as someone else's war\n\nYour creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for\n\nIf you're still breathing, it's not too late\n\nWe're all carrying one big burden, sharing one fate\n\n\n\nI'm a white man living on a white man's street\n\nI've got the bones of the red man under my feet\n\nThe highway runs through their burial grounds\n\nPast the oceans of cotton\n\n\n\nI'm a white man looking in a black man's eyes\n\nWishing I'd never been one of the guys\n\nWho pretended not to hear another white man's joke\n\nOh, the times ain't forgotten\n\n\n\nThere's no such thing as someone else's war\n\nYour creature comforts aren't the only things worth fighting for\n\nYou're still breathing, it's not too late\n\nWe're all carrying one big burden, sharing one fate\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm a white man living in a white man's nation\n\nI think the man upstairs must'a took a vacation\n\nI still have faith, but I don't know why\n\nMaybe it's the fire in my little girl's eyes\n\nMaybe it's the fire in my little girl's eyes",
