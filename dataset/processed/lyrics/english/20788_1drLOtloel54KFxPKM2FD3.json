  "lyrics": "A year has passed\r\nSince I learned where you had gone\r\nSo far, so long\r\nThe last of you still infects my every move\r\nWithout you I'm confined\n\nI'll wait for you as you watch me fall\n\nIf ever you cared, if ever at all\n\nJust one more night, if not one last kiss\n\nWe'll say goodbye, forget what we missed\n\n\n\nI am starting to forget your eyes, shut tight all night\n\nMiles away are the nights that we would say\n\nUntil death do we break\n\n\n\nI'll wait for you as you watch me fall\n\nIf ever you cared, if ever at all\n\nJust one more night, if not one last kiss\n\nWe'll say goodbye, at last\n\n\n\nLast night I packed your pictures away with all of your clothes\n\nThe smell of you disappeared\n\nReplaced by deafening calm\n\nLast night I tore the last piece of you from my shaking hand\n\nI know you're not coming back\n\n\n\nI begged you not to leave that night\n\nWait for me\n\nWait for me\n\nWait for me\n\n\n\nI'll wait for you as you watch me fall\n\nIf ever you cared, if ever at all\n\nJust one more night, if not one last kiss\n\nWe'll say goodbye, forget what we missed\n\nForget what we missed, yeah\n\nForget what we missed\n\nForget what we missed\n\nWhat we missed\n\nYeah\n\nWait for me",
