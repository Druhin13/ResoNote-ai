  "lyrics": "When I'm gone don't bring me pretty flowers\r\nAnd don't sit and cry for me at my tombstone\r\nCome and visit me in the midnight hours\r\nWith your party on\r\nThink of me and recall all the good times\n\nBring your memories and a bottle of old Jim Beam\n\nTake a swig as a haunted honky tonk moon shines\n\nAnd remember me\n\n\n\nPour whisky on my grave\n\nLet it seep into my bones\n\nHave a drink with me\n\nEven when I'm gone\n\nI'll do the same for you\n\nIf you'll do the same for me\n\nTurn it up and take a shot\n\nSet my spirit free\n\nDon't forget the promise that you made\n\nPour whiskey on my grave\n\n\n\nWhen my time is up don't let the good times be gone\n\nLet me still go like I wanted to go\n\nKicking it up and drinking with my boots on\n\nWith a rebel soul\n\n\n\nPour whisky on my grave\n\nLet it seep into my bones\n\nHave a drink with me\n\nEven when I'm gone\n\nI'll do the same for you\n\nIf you'll do the same for me\n\nTurn it up and take a shot\n\nSet my spirit free\n\nDon't forget the promise that you made\n\nPour whiskey on my grave\n\n\n\nWhen I'm gone don't bring me pretty flowers\n\nAnd don't sit and cry for me at my tombstone\n\nCome and visit me in the midnight hours\n\nWith your party on",
