  "lyrics": "I don't know if we have a connection\r\nAnymore, yeah, it feels like we're missing\r\nEach other in the night, like two ships passing by\r\nI don't know\r\nWe gotta come together (come together, come together)\n\nWe gotta come together (come together, come together)\n\nLet's take it back where we started\n\nCentre ourselves on the target again\n\nWe gotta come together, come together, come together\n\n\n\nI don't think that we have an attachment\n\nAnymore, same side of the magnet\n\nCan't remember your touch\n\nHow did we get so lost?\n\nI don't know\n\n\n\nWe gotta come together (come together, come together)\n\nWe gotta come together (come together, come together)\n\nLet's take it back where we started\n\nCentre ourselves on the target again\n\nWe gotta come together, come together, come together\n\n\n\nAnd I don't know where we lost it\n\nBut I don't think I could live without\n\nGod, I hope I haven't lost you yet\n\nWhat can we do to straighten this out?\n\n\n\nWe gotta come together\n\nWe gotta come together\n\nWe gotta come together\n\nWe gotta come together",
