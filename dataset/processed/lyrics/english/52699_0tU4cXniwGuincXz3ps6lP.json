  "lyrics": "I don't know precisely which day\r\nColoured me Other\r\nPer chance it may have been a slow bleed\r\nSo I cut out whichever shape I need\r\nI don't sue for rescue\n\nI'm as free as I have ever been\n\n\n\nDon't want another rock\n\nTo hang about my neck\n\nYou see bejewelled\n\nI see bedecked\n\nIn dead stars\n\n\n\nAnd nothing\n\nTouching me\n\nNothing touching me\n\n\n\nI am glad for open windows\n\nI call for birds that do not come\n\nYou beacon dead eyed welcome\n\n\n\nBones bleach off the city\n\nAnd when I'm done, I'm done, I'm done\n\nKeep eternal for your worry\n\n\n\nI don't want to look upon another word\n\nThis heart so lightly thrown\n\nI say \"disarm\"\n\nI hear \"disown\"\n\nIt sounds familiar\n\n\n\nAnd nothing\n\nTouching me\n\nNothing touching me\n\n\n\nI don't want another rock\n\nTo hang about my neck\n\nYou see bejewelled\n\nI see bedecked\n\nIn dead stars\n\n\n\nI don't want to look upon another word\n\nThis deal so lightly spent\n\nAnd what says \"here\"\n\nMeans \"came and went\"\n\nIt sounds familiar\n\n\n\nNothing's touching me\n\nNothing's touching me",
