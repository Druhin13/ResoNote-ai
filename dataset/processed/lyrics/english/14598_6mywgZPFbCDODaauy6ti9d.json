  "lyrics": "Your heart is like an ocean\r\nI wanna dive into you\r\nYour love is like a river\r\nThat I'm swimming through\r\nSomehow I found someone who truly loves me\n\nFor all of my flaws\n\nIf you can call when I am down, then I am yours\n\n\n\nSo darling do you want me? Need me?\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\nI just want you near me, believe me\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\nAnd all of these roads I've walked down led to you\n\nSo darling, take it easy, lay with me\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\n\n\nYour eyes are constellations\n\nYou light up the dark\n\nSuch a beautiful creation\n\nThat's just what you are\n\n\n\nAnd I finally found someone who keeps me steady\n\nThrough every storm\n\nIf you can call when I am broken, I am yours\n\n\n\nSo darling do you want me? Need me?\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\nI just want you near me, believe me\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\nAnd all of these roads I've walked down led to you\n\nSo darling, take it easy, lay with me\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\n\n\nWe are made up with broken pieces of love\n\nAnd all we ever really need is someone\n\nTo put the pieces back together and make us whole, again\n\n\n\nNow do you want me? Need me?\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\nI want you near me, believe me\n\nStay the night, stay the night\n\nAnd all of these roads I've walked down led to you\n\nSo darling, take it easy, lay with me\n\nStay the night, stay the night",
