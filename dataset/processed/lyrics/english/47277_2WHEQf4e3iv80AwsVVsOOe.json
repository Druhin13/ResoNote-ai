  "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Settle Down par David Zincke\r\nFrom the west I run to the safety of \n\nThe fallen song in my gun \n\nAs my father says hold on \n\n\n\nThere's only so many times I can recount what I've denied\n\nAs I face what I've become \n\n\n\nAs my mother says what's done is done \n\n\n\nSettle down my son \n\nYou only die once \n\n\n\nThrough symphonies and tortured seas\n\nI rest upon this breeze \n\nBut the echo carries on \n\n\n\n\nOh nothing can be wrong \n\nOh nothing can be wrong \n\n\n\nSettle down my son \n\nYou only die once \n\n\n\nSo believe what I say you can get lost in just a day \n\nWhen that bridge that you burned has gone \n\nEven your brother says so long \n\n\n\nSettle down my son \n\nyou only die once \n\nYou can see \n\nwhat you want it to be",
