  "lyrics": "Untethered layers\r\nSo thin as paper\r\nLet them all, like vapor\r\nDissipate, integrate\r\nWhen they hit air\n\nWe laid in the parking lot\n\nWatched the stars\n\nAnd the shooting stars\n\nWe know who we are\n\nFrom beyond to the veiled\n\nIntention between our cells\n\n\n\nOne thing, there is no other\n\nOnly this, there is no other\n\nThis one thing\n\nThere is no other\n\n\n\nAll my desire\n\nTo what I aspire\n\nWhen I expire\n\nDown dirtward all my hunger\n\nIn fire burn my anger\n\nAnd collapse my stature\n\n\n\nAlways now\n\nNo before after\n\nOnly this, there is no other\n\nUp skyward goes my water\n\nHang my want cloud\n\nIn the atmosphere\n\n\n\nOne thing, there is no other\n\nOnly this, there is no other\n\nThis one thing\n\nThere is no other\n\n\n\nJust layers of this one thing\n\n\n\nLiving in slo-mo\n\nDaily follow natural law\n\n\n\nCordon off sorrow\n\nTourniquet until it falls off\n\n\n\nBeyond fences\n\nFacing westward\n\nInto diminishing lightÂ—\n\nBut at the start of spring\n\nLike the robins sing\n\n\"This ole king will be rising\n\nA new love blooms on the\n\nLong notes of old horns.\"",
