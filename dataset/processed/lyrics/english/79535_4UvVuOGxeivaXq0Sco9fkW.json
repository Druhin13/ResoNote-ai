  "lyrics": "I've been burned in my prime\r\nThe simple things in life\r\nSeem so hard to learn sometimes\r\nAnd it takes so long\r\nCatch it while you can\r\nToo late tomorrow\n\nAnd everyone\n\n\n\nSaid we all know what comes of that\n\nLiving in your pockets and talking through your hat\n\nBut it won't take long\n\nTo turn your head around\n\nToo late tomorrow\n\n'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man\n\nTurn the world around\n\nToo late tomorrow\n\n'Cause everyone\n\n\n\nEveryone is waiting, just anticipating on you\n\nWon't you make a showing everybody knows what to do\n\nTake a dive from your ivory tower\n\nAnd fall on everyone will catch you, everyone\n\n\n\nI would be so pleased to spend some time\n\nTo hear a little talk about what's been on your mind\n\n'Cause it don't take long\n\nTo turn my head around\n\nIf it comes easy\n\n'Cause everyone needs the love of the common man\n\nTurn the world around\n\nToo late tomorrow\n\n'Cause everyone",
