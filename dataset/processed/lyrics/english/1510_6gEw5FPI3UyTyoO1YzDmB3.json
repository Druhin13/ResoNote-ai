  "lyrics": "Man, I had a dream that my father told me\r\n\"Let's play a game, look me in my eyes\r\nAnd just make sure you don't blink\r\nYou can ask me anything you want\r\nBut remember, don't blink\"\r\nI said, \"Shit\"\n\nI got all courage in the world to start asking shit\n\nThat I never had the courage to ask before\n\nLike, \"What's wrong with me?\"\n\nLike, \"Okay, I'm born an addict, do you think that you doing drugs had more than an adverse effect on me?\"\n\n\"Do you think if you didn't do drugs did maybe I somehow would have came out better? Would I had done better?\n\nI got one\n\nI was always seeking your approval as a—as a child\n\nYou made me feel like I could never do shit right\n\nI always wanted to know, like, through everything that I've been through in the game, do I make you proud?\n\nLike, are you proud of me? Finally?\"\n\nAnd then I was about to ask him about the abuse with my mom and, like, I fuckin' blinked\n\nAs soon as I blinked (I wanna know if it's okay if)\n\nI'm looking at my son in, like, in the face (Kinda ask some questions)\n\nThe objective of the paper is to go in depths about\n\nThe figure in our lives that we find inspiring\n\nThe one we look up to\n\nI wanted to do mines about you\n\nI remember the title I had for it and\n\nI was—I was thinking of calling it, The Book of Ryan\n\nI was kinda sitting and trying to get in the first paragraph\n\nAnd I started to realize how difficult it is to write\n\nHow can I write the paper of my father when I don't know who he is?\n\nSo I guess the first question is, \"Who are you?\"",
