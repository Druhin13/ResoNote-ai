  "lyrics": "On that day\r\nwe will sing of the Name\r\nmore excellent than angels,\r\nA purified bride,\r\nA refined heart,\r\nspeech and mind,\n\nWhere unity and fellowship\n\nare perfected in the Church,\n\nWhere divine love rests in the hearts\n\nof the inhabitants of the New Earth,\n\n\n\nAnd receive a crown\n\nonly to cast it down\n\nat the feet\n\nof the resurrected Jesus\n\nin a perfect,\n\nceaseless\n\nform of worship...\n\nSinging \"Glory!\"\n\nTo the liberating King\n\nwho came not to conquer kingdoms\n\nbut conquer hearts and restore\n\nMen back to what\n\nthey were intended for.\n\n\n\nAnd escape from this life\n\nmarked by anguish.\n\n\n\nA great fountain of love\n\nthat flows from Heaven's gates\n\nawaits us.\n\n\n\nYou can take this world,\n\nits joys,\n\nand its fleeting pleasures\n\nBut give us Jesus!\n\n\n\n- our future hope\n\nand our greatest treasure;\n\nthe fulfillment of our expectation\n\nwith nothing to separate us.\n\n\n\nNothing to hinder the saints\n\nfrom the greatest expression\n\nof adoration!\n\n\n\nFinally fit\n\nwith language to describe\n\nwith the right words to express\n\nThe richness of eternal possession,\n\nthe blessing of inheritance.\n\n\n\nWhere God will be seen\n\nthrough purified eyes\n\nPurged from the sin\n\nthat blinded us\n\nfrom viewing God as glorified.\n\n\n\nWhere love will be expressed\n\nwith the perfect affection.\n\n\n\nUntil then,\n\nwe wait with expectation\n\nfor all that we will acquire in heaven!\n\n\n\nLord!\n\nYou did everything\n\nrequired to save us\n\nand bring us\n\nInto Your Presence!\n\n\n\nSo to know You\n\nand behold You\n\nis our hearts desire!\n\n\n\nThere is nothing higher!\n\n\n\nNothing greater to acquire!\n\n\n\n\"Holy! Holy! Holy!\"\n\nis the song of the choir.\n\n\n\nYour people sing Your praises,\n\ngathered from all the nations\n\nwe were chosen to be holy\n\nand blameless\n\nbefore the earth's foundation.\n\n\n\nAnd it's only on the basis\n\nof Your glorious grace\n\nAnd we will never grow tired\n\nof gazing upon Your face,\n\n\n\nAnd falling before Your feet,\n\nworshipping at Your throne\n\nYour appearance is like carnelian \n\nand precious gemstones.\n\n\n\nLike nothing we've ever seen,\n\nYour glory never fades\n\n- The lamb of God who was slain\n\nto wash away sin's stain.\n\n\n\nWe were ransomed by Your blood,\n\nYour loss was our gain\n\nAnd You live forevermore,\n\nLord, forever You will reign!\n\n\n\nThe King of all Kings,\n\nName above every Name\n\nAnd everyone who trusts in You\n\nwill not be put to shame!\n\n\n\nO Jesus, King most wonderful\n\nThou Conqueror renowned,\n\nThou Sweetness most ineffable,\n\nIn whom all joys are found!\n\n\n\nO Jesus, Light of all below,\n\nThou Fount of life and fire,\n\nSurpassing all the joys we know,\n\nAnd all we can desire...\n\n\n\nMay every heart confess Thy name\n\nAnd ever Thee adore\n\nAnd, seeking Thee, itself inflame\n\nTo seek Thee more and more!\n\n\n\n\n\n(Thanks to AwakenedSon for these lyrics)",
