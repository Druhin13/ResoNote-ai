  "lyrics": "1, 2, 3, 4\r\nI love the way it flows\r\nI love the way it grows\r\nThere’s something in this sound that takes me far\r\nIt’s like a special song\n\nCan move my mood along\n\nBut I cannot say you’ll hear through my guitar\n\n\n\nShe told me add a bassline\n\nAnd everything will be alright\n\nShe told me that the groove is mine\n\nWill take us through the night\n\nAnd where I’ll go\n\nCan’t explain I’ll never know\n\nBut it’s beautiful\n\n\n\nYou can’t take this away from me\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\nYou can’t take this away from me\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\n\n\nI love the way it sings\n\nAll the joy that it brings\n\nRemember skating down the road towards the park?\n\nI can never say no\n\nYou with that summer glow\n\nThe music gives me sun when winter starts\n\n\n\nShe told me add a bassline\n\nAnd everything will be alright\n\nShe told me that the beat is mine\n\nIt will rock us through the night\n\nAnd where I’ll go\n\nCan’t explain I’ll never know\n\nBut it’s beautiful\n\n\n\nYou can’t take this away from me (oh)\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\nYou can’t take this away from me (oh)\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\n\n\nYou can’t take this away from me (oh)\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\nYou can’t take this away from me (oh)\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\n\n\nYo, I wear notes like coats\n\nBlues like doos, war for the rhythm, soul that glues\n\nThat bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine\n\nThe hop is my home, rap is my grind\n\nI'm grindin' on the back side of life, we dance\n\nShe threw me a chance, my hands in my pants\n\nActually, my pockets holdin' me tight, whispering a dream I could hold in the night\n\nLook tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins\n\nWake up and put it on the pad, the pains\n\nLike church, the organ will invite the tears\n\nLike birth, I'm cryin' so you know I'm here\n\nHeld by the song that gave me a name\n\nDressed by the verse that gave me a claim\n\n(There’s just a baseline) safe to inhale\n\nAnd if you're well\n\nBelonger years in this state, you will be\n\nA timeless octave to play for the tree\n\nThat’s rooted in every single nerve in me\n\nThe nerve of he who ignores the key\n\nAnd use it to open the minds that be free\n\nWhenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free\n\nBeneath the clouds, you allowed to, in clarity, through harmony\n\nSomeone harmin’ me?\n\nThat won't be done\n\nI stand protected by the laws of fun\n\nI am perfected by the rhymes of Run\n\nWalkin' this way had the party stunned\n\nThis music, it launched me\n\nWith no aim, I've landed with some plane\n\nWhere I am I can't explain or ever know\n\nBut it's beautiful so...\n\n\n\nYou can’t take this away from me\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me\n\nYou can’t take this away from me\n\nThe way I hit the melody\n\nThe waves bring clarity\n\nRunning through me",
