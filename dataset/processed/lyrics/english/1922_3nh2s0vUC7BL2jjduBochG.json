  "lyrics": "It was Christmas in prison\r\nand the food was real good\r\nwe had turkey and pistols\r\ncarved out of wood\r\nand I dream of her always\r\neven when I don't dream\n\nher name's on my tongue\n\nand her blood's in my stream.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\nWait awhile eternity\n\nold mother nature's got nothing on me\n\ncome to me\n\nrun to me\n\ncome to me, now\n\nwe're rolling\n\nmy sweetheart\n\nwe're flowing\n\nby God!\n\n\n\nShe reminds me of a chess game\n\nwith someone I admire\n\nor a picnic in the rain\n\nafter a prairie fire\n\nher heart is as big\n\nas this whole goddamn jail\n\nand she's sweeter than saccharine\n\nat a drug store sale.\n\n\n\nChorus:\n\n\n\nThe search light in the big yard\n\nswings round with the gun\n\nand spotlights the snowflakes\n\nlike the dust in the sun\n\nit's Christmas in prison\n\nthere'll be music tonight\n\nI'll probably get homesick\n\nI love you. Goodnight.\n\n\n\nChorus:",
