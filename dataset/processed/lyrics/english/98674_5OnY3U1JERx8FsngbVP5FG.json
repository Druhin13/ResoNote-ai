  "lyrics": "Never the taste of fear\r\nYou got left in the fine print\r\nThe font was serif'd and tasteless\r\nIt was slanted and Latin to death\r\nThey Said “Come on and get off of the bridge\r\nAnd we can take the cameras down”\n\nWhen all you really want is somewhere between here and the ground\n\n\n\nYou are not in love\n\nSo stop playing along\n\n\n\nThey found the fountain of youth\n\nWhy would they strike the cameras now?\n\nThe malaise set in here\n\nAnd no ones making any sound\n\nThey said “Come on tell us everything”\n\nFrom the gallows\n\nA Penitent\n\nBegging forgiveness\n\nThey told you instead:\n\n\"Pull that rat heart out of your chest\n\nIt doesn't mean anything to us now”\n\nYou are not in love\n\nSo stop playing along\n\n\n\nYour heart beats with us now\n\n\n\nYou are not in love\n\nSo stop playing along",
