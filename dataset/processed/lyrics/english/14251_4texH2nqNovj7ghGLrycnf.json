  "lyrics": "Everybody says I love you\r\nBut not everybody lives I love you\r\nWithout our past\r\nHow will we know it's us\r\nLove is not enough\n\nI could've held you more carefully\n\nAnd I suppose you could've been there for me\n\nBut then again they say it's meant to be\n\nLove is not enough\n\n\n\nChoosing not to remember\n\nIs no way to forget\n\nThat's just a losing bet\n\nIt's so unjust\n\nWhen love is not enough\n\n\n\nThese old streets of shame\n\nWill they ever look the same\n\nWill they remember our name\n\nJust ask the dust\n\nLove is not enough",
