  "lyrics": "Living in proximity of a dollar trying to get ahead of the pack\r\nBut you never learned, you never got it did ya?\r\nHow to glide past people sleeping on the sidewalk\r\nDreaming about stepping over something to bite on\r\nFeeling pretty weak and you need something to rely on\r\nSomething you can’t find in a store\n\n\n\nNYC Observation, is it a swan song wildly ahead of itself?\n\nBut you never listened to the music did ya?\n\nTalk so loud you don’t hear other people’s problems\n\nTrying not to look, you’re not the person to solve them\n\n“Waste it all on booze”, we all need something to revolve on\n\nSomething that you can’t afford\n\n\n\nK2 sales are gaining and they ain’t gonna drop, no\n\nBig Boy was the scene of the crime\n\nFenced unfinished condo beats a pissed soak curb\n\nYeah, it smells like burning plastic but it comes from a rock\n\nNow shelter curfew is passed, looks like tonight you got locked out\n\nGood a place as any to lay low and stay clocked out\n\nSome things you just can’t ignore",
