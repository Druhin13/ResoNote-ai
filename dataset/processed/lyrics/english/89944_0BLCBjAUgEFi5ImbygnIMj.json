  "lyrics": "Walk a little different these days\r\nSeems like things are going my way I guess\r\nStill could stand to talk a little less\r\nMaybe it's the pain in my chest\r\nBook is by the side of my bed\r\nProbably read my phone instead of it\n\nStubborn like I’d never admit\n\nShowing up alone like this\n\n\n\nI don't need anything\n\nAnything other than\n\nTouch of my angel's hand\n\nWhenever she can lend\n\n\n\nTryna do a little bit more\n\nIs it gonna work out? Well sure it is\n\nAny everything ya insist\n\nTalk it like I never miss\n\nChewing on my fingers again\n\nHabit isn’t leaving no end to it\n\nLanded on my head and it split\n\nNo one's laying low like this\n\n\n\nI don't need anything\n\nAnything other than\n\nTouch of my angel's hand\n\nWhenever she can lend",
