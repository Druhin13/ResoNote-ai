  "lyrics": "What kind of river we riding on?\r\nWhat kind of ride do we roam?\r\nWhich way do we go when the breeze is gone?\r\nWho's behind the lies we've been told?\r\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\n\n\nWake me up when it's going down\n\nLet the voice in your heart make a lot of sound\n\nWake me up when it's going down\n\nWhose head is holding this heavy crown?\n\n\n\nWhere do we go when the road runs out\n\nLove will rise up indeed\n\nDone whispering and thinking loud\n\nDone blowing with the breeze\n\n\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\nBe the light in a cold, cold, cold world\n\n\n\nWake me up when it's going down\n\nLet the voice in your heart make a lot of sound\n\nWake me up when it's going down\n\nWhose head is holding this heavy crown?\n\n\n\nWhose head is holding this heavy crown?\n\nWhose head is holding this heavy crown?\n\nWhose head is holding this heavy crown?\n\nWhose head is holding this heavy crown?",
