  "lyrics": "Popcorn, soda, box of Raisinets\r\nVelvet-cushioned seats and soft armrests\r\nBest seat in my favorite movie house\r\nStart my dreaming as the lights go out\r\nUp on the silver screen, I picture me\r\nLiving out my passions, hopes, and fantasies\n\n\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\nThe one with the glint in her eyes\n\nThe girl that seldom loses\n\nBeautiful, with grace and style\n\nActing out her story\n\nStanding in her glory\n\nHappy ever after\n\nI want to the girl in the movies\n\n\n\nWish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent\n\nWatching others live their lives with confidence\n\nHere's a preview of some things to come\n\nIt's not too late for me to be someone\n\nI can't keep living in their make believe\n\nComing attractions will be starring me\n\n\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\nThe one with the stars in her eyes\n\nShe gets the roles she chooses\n\nShe can laugh or she can cry\n\nActing out her story\n\nStanding in her glory\n\nAlways happy endings\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\n\n\nIt's time I show the world just what I'm about\n\nI'm stepping up and I'm stepping out\n\nI'm feeling bold and I'm feeling proud\n\nI want to be that girl\n\n\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\nHmmmm\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\nHmmm\n\n\n\nGonna stand up\n\nAnd I'm gonna matter\n\n'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered\n\nAnd I've had enough of my tears begin splattered\n\nI've already been that girl\n\n\n\nOh, I want to be\n\nI want to be\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\nI want to be: hey look at me\n\nI want to be the girl in the movies\n\nI want to shine\n\nI want to shine\n\nIt's my time\n\nI want to shine\n\nI want to be happy, I want to be free\n\nJust like that girl in the movies",
