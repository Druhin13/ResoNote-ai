  "lyrics": "I took a journey through the devil's door\r\nChasing the freedom that I thought was Yours\r\nJust found the bottom of an icy floor and regret\r\nWith trembling hands and an empty breath\r\nYou saw the struggle and You cast the nets\n\nYou knew me better than I ever knew myself\n\nAnd now the only thing that's left... oh-oh-ooh\n\n\n\nIs Your love\n\nIs Your love\n\n\n\nI crossed the ocean and I searched the sky\n\nFor the riddles and the reasons why\n\nYou give a beggar like me a royal life, oh-oh-ooh\n\n\n\nWith trembling hands and an empty breath\n\nYou saw the struggle and You cast the nets\n\nYou knew me better than I ever knew myself\n\nAnd now the only thing that's left... oh-oh-ooh\n\n\n\nIs Your love\n\nIs Your love\n\n\n\nMy heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me\n\nMy heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me\n\nYour love, Your love, Your love\n\nYour love is endless\n\nYour love, Your love, Your love\n\nYour love is endless\n\n\n\nMy heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me\n\nMy heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me\n\nI can feel it, I hear it loud and clear\n\nMy heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me\n\nI can feel it, I hear it loud and clear\n\nMy heart is beating 'cause Your love it overtakes me\n\n\n\nI can feel it\n\nI hear it",
