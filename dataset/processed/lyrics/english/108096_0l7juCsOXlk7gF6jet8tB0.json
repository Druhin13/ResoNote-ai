  "lyrics": "There was a wayward lad\r\nStepped out one morning\r\nThe ground to be his bed\r\nThe sky his awning\r\nNeon, neon, neon\n\nA blue neon lamp in a midnight country field\n\nCan't surround so you lean on, lean on\n\nSo much your heart's become fond of this\n\n\n\nOh, these three worn words\n\nOh, let me whisper like the rubbing hands\n\nOf tourists in Verona\n\nI just want to love you in my own language\n\n\n\nWell, that smell of sex\n\nGood like burning wood\n\nThe wayward lad laid claim\n\nTo two thirsty girls from Hornsea\n\nWho left a note when morning came\n\n\n\nGirls from the pool say \"Hi\" (hi)\n\nThe road erodes at five feet per year\n\nAlong England's east coastline\n\nWas this your first time?\n\nLove is just a button we pressed\n\nLast night by the campfire\n\n\n\nOh, these three worn words\n\nOh, that we whisper like the rubbing hands\n\nOf tourists in Verona\n\nI just want to love you in my own language",
