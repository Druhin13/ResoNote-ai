(why you think that?)\n\nSame hood, different vision, same mission (road to riches)\n\nGot the shit we repped tatted on both my fists (both my hands)\n\nWhen you don't talk and keep your distance that make tension (too much friction)\n\n\n\nThey said it was love, but I couldn't see it, I was too blinded by the hatred\n\nWe was on bad terms so you think I'm speakin' on you every time I make a statement\n\nWhen you got people in the business instigating, they can have your mind racing (for real)\n\nWe could've been fixed it but we both let pride control the situation\n\nWhen the heat was on, everybody traded places (traded, traded)\n\nThey was chosin' sides like we was segregated (over here, over there)\n\nThrowin' shots, got the hood lookin' at us crazy (we was trippin')\n\nBut that's what happen when it's lack of communication (barely talkin')\n\n\n\nYou 'posed to be rockin' this chain with me\n\nYou 'posed to be reppin' the gang with me\n\nMoney got involved, bitches threw you off\n\n'Posed to be sharing this fame with me (damn)\n\nWe used to load up in your car, headed to shows\n\nWhen I first got my buzz\n\nI introduced you to this lifestyle\n\nDamn Jugg, where the love (Justin)\n\nWhy you go post a status 'fore I got a chance to repay you (answer that)\n\nNever go against the grain, that's a rule though\n\nYou played yourself, I ain't trippin', I'm cool though\n\nAnd I ain't gon' speak on that other dude 'cause this a real nigga conversation (he don't fit)\n\nAnd I still feel like you be hatin', that's why I don't fuck with niggas like I'm racist (fuck 'em)\n\nJust use my success as your motivation (motivation)\n\nMy problem now is I don't clear up altercations (I hold grudges)\n\nI walk around with my mood on fuck you pay me (fuck you, fuck you)\n\nI been breakin' bread with all my niggas lately (BGE the gang)\n\n\n\nThey said it was love, but I couldn't see it, I was too blinded by the hatred\n\nWe was on bad terms so you think I'm speakin' on you every time I make a statement\n\nWhen you got people in the business instigating, they can have your mind racing (for real)\n\nWe could've been fixed it but we both let pride control the situation\n\nWhen the heat was on, everybody traded places (traded, traded)\n\nThey was chosin' sides like we was segregated (over here, over there)\n\nThrowin' shots, got the hood lookin' at us crazy (we was trippin')\n\nBut that's what happen when it's lack of communication (barely talkin')",
