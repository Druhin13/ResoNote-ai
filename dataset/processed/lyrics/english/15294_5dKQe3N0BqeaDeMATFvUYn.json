  "lyrics": "Sinking through stone\r\nReasons for being come so slowly\r\nPlacing to show\r\nPlanned obsolescence embryos\r\nRoaming free with depravity\n\nHolding hands with a hollow man\n\nSome kind of new manipulation\n\n\n\nCharm and betray\n\nRuin and replay\n\nSeduce and deceive\n\nDestroy and repeat\n\n\n\nTrading lives for existences\n\nA screen door to a warmer war\n\nIt always ends with a flare inside a sphere\n\nAnd everything's clear\n\n\n\nPlease don't remember me\n\nLike I'll always remember you",
