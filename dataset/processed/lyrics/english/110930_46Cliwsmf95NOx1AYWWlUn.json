  "lyrics": "She set my '94 four door Ford on fire today\r\nSo I took her favorite pair of diamond earrings and I pawned them away\r\nThat's when she walked in the kitchen full of dishes and she broke every plate\r\nShe might be the death of me, but I wouldn't have it any other way\r\nShe might be my cocaine\n\nShe might be my rehab\n\nAnd I ain't tryna OD\n\nBut she’s going to make me relapse, yeah\n\n\n\nBut if crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\nAnd I know it’s messed up but I can’t get enough of you\n\nIt don’t matter what we say\n\nIt don’t matter all the things we do\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\n\n\nShe called my boss and she told him I ain’t coming in to work no more\n\nSo I changed every lock on every door before she got home\n\nIf I would get a dime every time she wants to go through my phone\n\nShe might be the death of me but I know I could never leave her alone\n\n\n\nShe might be my cocaine\n\nShe might be my rehab\n\nAnd I ain't tryna OD\n\nShe’s going to make me relapse, yeah\n\n\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\nAnd I know it’s messed up but I can’t get enough of you\n\nDon’t matter what we say\n\nDon’t matter all the things we do\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\n\n\nShe might be my cocaine\n\nShe might be my rehab\n\nBut I don’t care what anybody’s saying\n\n\n\nShe’s the pain and my medicine\n\nThe problem and my solution\n\nBut she knows I wouldn’t have it any other way\n\n\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\nAnd I know it’s messed up but I can’t get enough of you\n\nIt don’t matter what we say\n\nIt don’t matter all the things we do\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two\n\nIf crazy is a place, then I hope they’ve got space for two",
