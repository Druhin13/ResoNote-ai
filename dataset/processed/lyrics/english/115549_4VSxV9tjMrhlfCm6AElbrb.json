Oh\r\nWe're looking for a king\r\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\r\nWe’re looking for the Prince of Peace\n\n'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth\n\nWe're looking for a king\n\nI think I found a King\n\nI think I found a King, yeah\n\nOver everything\n\nPut Him over everything, yeah\n\n\n\nSix miles to a real messiah\n\nSteady waiting for a king since Jeremiah\n\nOr really since me molded China and the Carolinas\n\nJust to leave a brother speechless like laryngitis\n\nThey barely write it in the book what it looks like\n\nHooked on chasin’ bright lights on a foot hike (Where we goin'?)\n\nJust to find something or better someone\n\nSome young kid to do what we had undone\n\nAnd that's no walk in the park\n\n'Cause they ain't hear the cherubim droppin' the harks\n\nYou wonder if this star won't stop in the dark\n\nYou wonder if you did the whole walk on a farce\n\nAnd I could feel that too\n\nTryna see it as He's leading me through\n\nKeep your eyes on the Star and you’ll be dreamin’ it too\n\nAnd keep the frankincense handy, you'll be needin’ it soon\n\nHe's got redeemin' to do, yeah\n\n\n\nWe three kings with the diamond rings, bringing gifts, coming from afar\n\nOver the hills and moors and mountains, following yonder star\n\nBorn a King in Bethlehem, have you seen the One they call Messiah? Oh\n\nWe're looking for a king\n\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\n\nWe’re looking for the Prince of Peace\n\n'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth\n\nWe're looking for a king\n\nI think I found a King\n\nI think I found a King, yeah\n\nOver everything\n\nPut Him over everything\n\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\nThree kings, wise, rode all night\n\nOoh, what a blessing it is to be in Your sight\n\nStarin' at the sun, Your glory shines so bright\n\nI could see the stars shinin' on you all night\n\nOne day, uh, we've been waitin' for this one day, yeah\n\nAnd we've been hopin' for a long time, yeah\n\nThat we knew You were comin' some day\n\nOh, come on, so come on, come on\n\nPraise the Savior, hear the angels\n\nSing the songs from the Heavens that we know You came from\n\nWas the lowest of the low, born in the manger\n\nCame to Earth out of love so You could save us\n\nThree kings\n\n\n\nWe three kings with the diamond rings, bringing gifts, coming from afar\n\nOver the hills and mossy mountains, following yonder star\n\nBorn a King in Bethlehem, have you seen the One they call Messiah? Oh\n\nWe're looking for a king\n\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining\n\nWe're looking for the Prince of Peace\n\n'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth\n\nWe're looking for a king\n\n\n\nI think I found a King\n\nI think I found a King, yeah\n\nOver everything\n\nPut Him over everything, yeah\n\nI think I found a King\n\nI think I found a King, yeah\n\nOver everything\n\nPut Him over everything, yeah",
