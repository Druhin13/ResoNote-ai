  "lyrics": "Sometimes things break\r\nSometimes things break\r\nYou don't always see it coming\r\nOut of nowhere without warning\r\nLike a punch right to the stomach\r\nTakes your breath away\n\nSometimes things break\n\n\n\nAll that lives forever is love\n\nAll that lives forever is love\n\n\n\nSometimes stars fade\n\nSometimes stars fade\n\nThey come falling from the heavens\n\nChase them down but you won't catch them\n\nWatch their bright light disappear into the dark\n\nSometimes stars fade\n\n\n\nAll that lives forever is love\n\nAll that lives forever is love\n\n\n\nWe're travelers here, only passing through\n\nAnd every breath we breathe is coming back to You\n\nWe're strangers here, I know it's true\n\nThat death is just a door that leads us home to You\n\nWe're travelers here, only passing through\n\nAnd every breath we breathe is coming back to You\n\nWe're strangers here, I know it's true\n\nThat death is just a door that leads us home to You\n\nThat death is just a door that leads us home to You\n\nThat death is just a door that leads us home to You\n\n\n\nAll that lives forever is love\n\nAll that lives forever is love",
