  "lyrics": "An ocean between us is too close\r\nWill you give up the ghost\r\nYou are a constant obsession\r\nThat hides before my eyes\r\nAre you ready for the perfect deception?\n\nThe smiling face remains the same\n\n\n\nTake this blade and release me\n\nThis is no way to live\n\nCan you tear the veil from my dreams\n\nAnd let me breathe again\n\n\n\nI can feel you around me\n\nForever won't be far behind\n\n\n\nYou are horror from the point of conception\n\nYou were born within the gray\n\n\n\nTake this blade and release me\n\nThis is no way to live\n\nCan you tear the veil from my dreams\n\nAnd let me breathe again\n\n\n\nCan no one hear me?\n\nDon't let the virus spread\n\n\n\nEnslaved by the way that you move me\n\nI'm enslaved by the way that you move me\n\nDon't let the virus spread\n\n\n\nTake this blade and release me\n\nThis is no way to live\n\nCan you tear the veil from my dreams\n\nAnd let me breathe again\n\n\n\nTake this blade and release me\n\nThis is no way to live\n\nCan you tear the veil from my dreams\n\nAnd let me breathe again\n\n\n\nDon't let the virus spread\n\nDon't let the virus spread",
