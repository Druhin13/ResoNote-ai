  "lyrics": "There's an empty road\r\nWalked up on my leg\r\nAnd the chicken woman\r\nPushing carts down the way\r\nThey're in the back\n\nFeet falling through the floor\n\nAnd the chicken woman\n\nHas her head out the door\n\n\n\nShe's walking down the street\n\nThe chicken woman, the chicken woman\n\nShe's walking down the street\n\nThe chicken woman, the chicken woman, oh yeah\n\n\n\nWalked in the house\n\nSlaughter written on the wall\n\nThey're just counting seconds\n\nBefore the eye starts to fall\n\n\n\nYou think she's mad\n\nSo maybe she is\n\nBut she ain't got time\n\nFor your foolish little trick\n\n\n\nShe's walking down the street\n\nThe chicken woman, the chicken woman\n\nShe's walking down the street\n\nThe chicken woman, the chicken woman, oh yeah",
