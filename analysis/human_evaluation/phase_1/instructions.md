# ResoNote: Music Tagging Study - Annotator Instructions

## Overview

Thank you for participating in this music tagging research study for the ResoNote project. Your expertise as a music professional is invaluable in helping us establish a "gold standard" dataset for evaluating artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and categorize music based on lyrical content.

## Research Context

This study is part of an undergraduate research project titled "ResoNote: A Semantic Playlist Generator for Emotionally-Aligned Music Recommendation" conducted at the University of London, Department of Computer Science. The project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can extract structured semantic meaning from song lyrics to create more emotionally resonant and contextually coherent playlists.

While contemporary music recommendation systems rely heavily on collaborative filtering and acoustic features, ResoNote reimagines music recommendation as a task of narrative alignment. Your human annotations will serve as the benchmark against which various LLM systems will be evaluated for their ability to understand emotional tone, thematic content, and narrative structure in music.

## Your Task

You will be asked to listen to and tag 50 music tracks. For each track:

1. **Review the track information and lyrics** displayed on screen
2. **Apply tags** in four categories:

   - **Emotional Tone**: adjectives describing affect/mood.
   - **Thematic Content**: nouns/compound nouns capturing subject matter.
   - **Narrative Structure**: nouns/compound nouns describing story/structure devices.
   - **Lyrical Style**: nouns/compound nouns for poetic/linguistic style.

## Important Guidelines

### Take Your Time

- There is no time limit for this study
- You can take breaks between tracks whenever needed.
- Your progress is automatically saved.

### Use Your Expertise

- Apply your professional knowledge and experience.
- Prioritize textual evidence in lyrics.
- Stay within the list: select only from the available canonical tags.
- Consider both obvious and subtle elements within each song.
- Plain over obscure: prefer broadly understandable choices.
- If you're uncertain about a tag, you can access definitions in the program.
- Trust your intuition – your expert judgment is what we're seeking
- Remember that the goal is to identify the emotional resonance and narrative aspects that might connect with different user contexts
- Do not use music videos, artist bios, or external websites. Judge only from the provided lyrics.

### Be Consistent

- Try to apply tags consistently across all tracks
- Use the "None" tag only when no other tags in that category apply
- If you make a mistake, you can retry tagging a track
- Affect vs. theme vs. style:
  - If it’s primarily a feeling, tag it in Emotional_Tone.
  - If it names a topic/concept, tag it in Thematic_Content.
  - If it’s about story shape/devices, use Narrative_Structure.
  - If it’s a poetic/linguistic device or delivery style, use Lyrical_Style.

## Confidentiality and Recognition

Your contributions will be properly credited in the undergraduate thesis and any academic publications resulting from this research (unless you prefer anonymity). All data will be handled according to University of London research ethics standards.

## Research Impact

Your participation helps us understand how well AI models can interpret the emotional and thematic elements of music lyrics. This research aims to develop recommendation systems that can suggest music based on users' emotional states or narrative contexts (e.g., "recovering from heartbreak" or "moment of triumph"), rather than just similar acoustic features or listening habits.

By creating a human-annotated benchmark dataset, you're directly contributing to advances in emotionally-aligned music recommendation technology.

## Thank You

Your expert insights are crucial to establishing a robust benchmark for evaluating AI systems and potentially contributing to a more emotionally resonant approach to music recommendation. We deeply appreciate your time and expertise.
